    "main_text": "Science, religion, and how they interrelate || A brief history\n1.1 A brief history\n\nSince the 1960s, scholars in theology, philosophy, history, and the\nsciences have studied the relationship between science and religion.\nScience and religion is a recognized field of study with dedicated\njournals (e.g., Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science),\nacademic chairs (e.g., the Andreas Idreos Professor of Science and\nReligion at Oxford University), scholarly societies (e.g., the Science\nand Religion Forum), and recurring conferences (e.g., the European\nSociety for the Study of Science and Theology\u2019s biennial\nmeetings). Most of its authors are theologians (e.g., John Haught,\nSarah Coakley), philosophers with an interest in science (e.g., Nancey\nMurphy), or (former) scientists with long-standing interests in\nreligion, some of whom are also ordained clergy (e.g., the physicist\nJohn Polkinghorne, the molecular biophysicist Alister McGrath, and the\natmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe). Recently, authors in science\nand religion also have degrees in that interdisciplinary field (e.g.,\nSarah Lane Ritchie).\n\nThe systematic study of science and religion started in the 1960s,\nwith authors such as Ian Barbour (1966) and Thomas F. Torrance (1969)\nwho challenged the prevailing view that science and religion were\neither at war or indifferent to each other. Barbour\u2019s Issues\nin Science and Religion (1966) set out several enduring themes of\nthe field, including a comparison of methodology and theory in both\nfields. Zygon, the first specialist journal on science and\nreligion, was also founded in 1966. While the early study of science\nand religion focused on methodological issues, authors from the late\n1980s to the 2000s developed contextual approaches, including detailed\nhistorical examinations of the relationship between science and\nreligion (e.g., Brooke 1991). Peter Harrison (1998) challenged the\nwarfare model by arguing that Protestant theological conceptions of\nnature and humanity helped to give rise to science in the seventeenth\ncentury. Peter Bowler (2001, 2009) drew attention to a broad movement\nof liberal Christians and evolutionists in the nineteenth and\ntwentieth centuries who aimed to reconcile evolutionary theory with\nreligious belief. In the 1990s, the Vatican Observatory (Castel\nGandolfo, Italy) and the Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences\n(Berkeley, California) co-sponsored a series of conferences on divine\naction and how it can be understood in the light of various\ncontemporary sciences. This resulted in six edited volumes (see\nRussell, Murphy, & Stoeger 2008 for a book-length summary of the\nfindings of this project). \n\nThe field has presently diversified so much that contemporary\ndiscussions on religion and science tend to focus on specific\ndisciplines and questions. Rather than ask if religion and science\n(broadly speaking) are compatible, productive questions focus on\nspecific topics. For example, Buddhist modernists (see\n section 2.4)\n have argued that Buddhist theories about the self (the no-self) and\nBuddhist practices, such as mindfulness meditation, are compatible and\nare corroborated by neuroscience.\n\nIn the contemporary public sphere, a prominent interaction between\nscience and religion concerns evolutionary theory and\ncreationism/Intelligent Design. The legal battles (e.g., the\nKitzmiller versus Dover trial in 2005) and lobbying surrounding the\nteaching of evolution and creationism in American schools suggest\nthere\u2019s a conflict between religion and science. However, even\nif one were to focus on the reception of evolutionary theory, the\nrelationship between religion and science is complex. For instance, in\nthe United Kingdom, scientists, clergy, and popular writers (the\nso-called Modernists), sought to reconcile science and religion during\nthe late nineteenth and early twentieth century, whereas the US saw the\nrise of a fundamentalist opposition to evolutionary thinking,\nexemplified by the Scopes trial in 1925 (Bowler 2001, 2009).\n\nAnother prominent offshoot of the discussion on science and religion\nis the New Atheist movement, with authors such as Richard Dawkins, Sam\nHarris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens. They argue that\npublic life, including government, education, and policy should be\nguided by rational argument and scientific evidence, and that any form\nof supernaturalism (especially religion, but also, e.g., astrology)\nhas no place in public life. They treat religious claims, such as the\nexistence of God, as testable scientific hypotheses (see, e.g.,\nDawkins 2006).\n\nIn recent decades, the leaders of some Christian churches have issued\nconciliatory public statements on evolutionary theory. Pope John Paul\nII (1996) affirmed evolutionary theory in his message to the\nPontifical Academy of Sciences, but rejected it for the human soul,\nwhich he saw as the result of a separate, special creation. The Church\nof England publicly endorsed evolutionary theory (e.g., C. M. Brown\n2008), including an apology to Charles Darwin for its initial\nrejection of his theory.\n\nThis entry will focus on the relationship between religious and\nscientific ideas as rather abstract philosophical positions, rather\nthan as practices. However, this relationship has a large practical\nimpact on the lives of religious people and scientists (including\nthose who are both scientists and religious believers). A rich\nsociological literature indicates the complexity of these\ninteractions, among others, how religious scientists conceive of this\nrelationship (for recent reviews, see Ecklund 2010, 2021; Ecklund\n& Scheitle 2007; Gross & Simmons 2009).\n\nFor the past fifty years, the discussion on science and religion has\nde facto been on Western science and Christianity: to what\nextent can the findings of Western sciences be reconciled with\nChristian beliefs? The field of science and religion has only recently\nturned to an examination of non-Christian traditions, providing a\nricher picture of interaction.\n",
