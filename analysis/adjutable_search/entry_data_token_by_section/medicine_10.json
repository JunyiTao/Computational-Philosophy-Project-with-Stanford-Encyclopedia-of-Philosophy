Values in Medical Research\n\nThere is no doubt that medical research is shaped by various external\nvalues, in ways similar to the value ladeness that is well-recognized\nin other areas of science (see entry on\n scientific objectivity).\n Many of these values create a variety of ethical dilemmas relating to\nequity of access to health care and similar. Even in recent years once\nmedical research has been made more inclusive, this trend has\nintroduced a host of additional philosophical and ethical issues\n(Epstein 2007). For our purposes, we will focus on the implications of\nthe systematic exclusion of certain types of individuals, groups, or\ndiseases from research for future research as well as clinical medical\npractice in terms of the validity of evidence produced and decisions\nmade based on that evidence. \n\nIn traditional medical research, it was generally assumed that white\nmale participants could be used as the basis of generalizations that\nin turn could be extrapolated to all other populations, including\nminorities and females (Dresser 1992). Reviews of the literature\nindicate that women in particular have been excluded (especially older\nwomen), and that research on women has usually been related to\nreproductive function and capacity (Inborn and Whittle 2001). Such\ntypes of research have been argued to fail the ideals of quality\nmedical research as well as evidence-based health care (Dodds 2008).\nAlthough some improvements have been made in recent years, there\nremain certain forms of blanket exclusions for instance of women of\nchildbearing age or pregnant women in many types of medical research.\nThese types of systematic exclusion are highly problematic especially\nbecause there is clear evidence of critical differences between men\nand women with regard to a range of factors relating to receptivity to\ntherapies for both biological and social reasons. \n\nIn the case of minorities such as African-Americans in the United\nStates, even when research trials seek to recruit them, a range of\nfactors may contribute to them not being involved in medical and other\ntypes of research studies. These include distrust due to historical\nand institutional racism including research performed without consent;\nlack of understanding about research and consent; social stigma;\nfinancial considerations; and lack of culturally-sensitive recruitment\nmethods by researchers (e.g., Huang and Coker 2010). Such gaps in\nmedical research potentially lead to use of treatments or therapies\nthat may in fact be harmful for particular groups, and may result in\nthe withholding of therapies that might be beneficial.\n\nMedical research also is affected by which conditions or diseases are\nselected for investigation (Reiss and Kitcher 2008): perhaps most\nnotoriously, \u201corphan\u201d diseases which are either rare,\ncommon only in minority populations, or only present in certain\ndeveloping world or other lower socioeconomic settings, are often\nneglected for drug and other therapy development because it is\nperceived that there will not be a viable commercial market for any\nproducts on which research might be done due to the at-risk or\naffected population (and hence such potential products are often\ntermed \u201corphan drugs\u201d). In some cases patients may pursue\n\u201coff-label\u201d use of drugs which are approved for a\ncondition other than the one they have, because approval for an\n\u201corphan\u201d disease is unlikely due to cost and demand;\nhowever such off-label uses of drugs even when overseen by a physician\ntypically result in lack of consistent collection of evidence and\nabsence of typical risk-benefit regulatory considerations utilized\nwhen a drug is approved for particular purposes.\n\nA final way in which our knowledge in medicine generated by research\nis potentially adversely affected by values is through the funding\npatterns connected with research. As implied above, pharmaceutical\ncompanies sponsor a considerable portion of drug trials and have a\nvariety of interests at stake in these investments well beyond the\ngathering of evidence for the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of a\nparticular product. There is consistent evidence that negative\nresearch results typically are suppressed when sponsored by industry\n(Lexchin 2012a), leading to a bias in what is reported and thus what\nevidence is available on which to make prescribing and treatment\ndecisions. Bias also has been found in a number of other areas: within\nthe study itself in the choice of research question or topic of\ninvestigation, in the choice of doses or drugs against which the drug\nunder study is to be compared, in the control over trial design and\nvarious changes in protocols, and in decisions to terminate clinical\ntrials early, and in the reinterpretation of data, as well as in the\npublication of data such as restrictions on publication rights, use of\nfake journals, favoring journal supplements and symposia rather than\npeer review venues, the use of ghostwriting, and in the details of the\nreporting of results and outcomes (Sismondo 2008; Reiss 2010b; Lexchin 2012b). All of these\nissues weaken the evidence base on which clinical care judgments are\nmade, and also lead to potentially adverse effects for patients.\n",
