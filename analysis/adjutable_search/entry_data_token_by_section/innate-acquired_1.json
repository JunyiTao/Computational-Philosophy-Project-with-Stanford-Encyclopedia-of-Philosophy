    "main_text": "Outline of scientific debates over nativism || Darwin versus Wallace\n1.1 Darwin versus Wallace\n\nCharles Darwin pioneered an approach to the study of instinct that\naimed to show, above all, that instincts evolve gradually as\nadaptations to a species\u2019 environment. Darwin\u2019s theory of\ninstinct was developed in opposition to William Paley, William Kirby,\nand other influential Natural Theologians (Grinnell 1985; Richards\n1981; 1987; Rochowiak 1988). Paley defined an instinct as \u201ca\n[behavioral] propensity prior to experience and independent of\ninstruction\u201d (Richards 1981). Examples such as bird migration,\nnest building, and mating preference seemed, to Paley, not possibly\nacquired by experience. The best explanation for these instincts was\nthat they are Divinely implanted. Likewise, Kirby viewed animal\ninstincts as a means by which God animates the material world:\n\u201cif animals lost their instincts, birds would no longer build\ntheir nests, or migrate, or learn to fly. Bears would not know when to\nhibernate, nor salmon when to be driven upstream to spawn; the entire\nanimal kingdom would be thrown into disarray\u201d (Grinnell 1985,\n57). Like many theologically inspired naturalists at the time, Paley\nand Kirby drew a sharp distinction between instinctive vs acquired\nbehavior. Since instincts were thought to be designed by God, and thus\nperfect, there would be no need to supplement or modify them through\nindividual learning.\n\nDarwin offered a naturalistic alternative to the theological account.\nMarshalling anecdotes from zookeepers, breeders, and his own\nobservations, Darwin presented evidence that instincts adapt to a\nchanging environment. One process by which they evolve is unguided\nvariation and natural selection. However, like many of his\ncontemporaries, Darwin also accepted an alternative \u201cinherited\nhabits\u201d model of instinct evolution. Habits are behaviors that\noriginate as intelligent acts and become increasingly automatic over\nrepeated performances. Although historians disagree about which\nmechanism Darwin took to be the more significant, it appears that he\ntook both natural selection and inherited habits to be involved in the\nevolution of instinct. As he explained in The Origin,\n\u201cIf we suppose any habitual action to become inherited \u2013\nand I think that this does sometimes happen \u2013 then the\nresemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct\nbecomes so close as not to be distinguished\u201d (1859, 187).\nDarwin\u2019s dual-mechanism view inspired other researchers to\nexplore the relationship between intelligence, habit, and instinct. Of\nparticular note is George Romanes, a protege of Darwin who sought to\nclarify and elaborate his mentor\u2019s theory of instinct. In his\nbooks on animal intelligence, Romanes (1882; 1883) distinguished two\ntypes of instinct: primary instincts that evolve by a process\nof natural selection, and secondary instincts that evolve by\nthe inheritance of acquired habits.\n\nA noteworthy critic of Darwin\u2019s account of instinct was none\nother than Alfred Russel Wallace, co-founder of the principle of\nnatural selection. Wallace was notoriously hostile to Darwin\u2019s\nview of the human mind as the product of selection (Gould 1980). As he\nasserted in a letter to Charles Lyell,\n\nUnless Darwin can show me how this rudimentary or latent musical\nability in the lowest races can have been developed by survival of the\nfittest \u2013 can have been of use to the individual or race so as\nto cause those who possessed it in a fractional greater degree than\nothers to win the struggle for life, I must believe that some\nother power caused that development \u2013 and so on with every other\nespecially human characteristic. (1869, quoted in (Richards 1987, 183)\nitalics in original)\n\n\nWallace was critical of Darwin\u2019s claim, defended extensively in\nThe Descent of Man (1871) that many human behaviors are\ngrounded in instincts that are shared with other species. In his\nessay, \u201cOn instinct in man and animals,\u201d (1891) Wallace\npresented alternative explanations for how allegedly instinctive human\nbehaviors might be acquired by learning (Gross 2010). In a paper\nentitled \u201cThe philosophy of birds\u2019 nests\u201d, Wallace\nargued that Darwin was wrong even about the instinctive basis of\nanimal behavior:\n\nIf instinct means anything, it means the capacity to perform some\ncomplex act without teaching or experience. It implies not only innate\nideas but innate knowledge of a very definite kind\u2026 but in the\nparticular instance of birds\u2019 nests which is usually considered\nits stronghold, I cannot find a particle of evidence of anything\nbeyond those lower reason and imitative powers which animals are\nuniversally permitted to possess. (1891, quoted in Gross 2010, 503)\n\n\nNotice that Wallace understood instincts to involve knowledge\n\u201cof a very definite kind\u201d that arises without teaching or\nexperience. By contrast, he allowed that animals inherit certain\ngeneral (i.e. non-specific) cognitive capacities, such as \u201clower\nreason\u201d and learning by imitation, but these were not classified\nas instincts. Instead, Wallace described such general capacities as\nemanating from the \u201corganization of the nervous system\u201d\n(Gross 2010). He thought that these mechanisms provide a more\nplausible explanation for the acquisition of most animal and human\nbehavior than Darwin\u2019s appeal to instinct.\n",
