    "main_text": "Do works of art exist? || Elimination\n1.6 Elimination\n\n\nGiven a sufficiently austere ontology, titles such as \u2018Das Lied\nvon der Erde\u2019 and \u2018To the Lighthouse\u2019 have no real\nreferents. Those who defend such an ontology are rarely eager to\ntrumpet the implications for the arts, perhaps because doing so would\nbe a poor recommendation for the austerity. A few thinkers writing\nabout aesthetics have, however, conjectured that we would be better\noff without committing ourselves to the existence of works. For\nexample, Richard Rudner (1950) distinguished between questions about\nthe object of our aesthetic responses and questions about the\nreferents of the names of works. The answer to the latter question is\nthat such names are non-designative or syncategorematic. The former\nquestion, Rudner concludes, is not scientific and should be set\naside.\n\n\nRoland Barthes (1971) notoriously asserted that the concept of the\nwork of art is part of a repressive ideology that should be replaced\nby a liberating conception of textuality. The word\n\u2018textualit\u00e9\u2019 referred in his mind to a highly\nindeterminate and exciting sphere of semantic and erotic\npossibilities; \u2018une \u0153uvre\u2019 [a work] stood for an\nideological drag involving wrong-headed thinking about fixed meanings,\nownership, and repression.\n\n\nIn a somewhat similar spirit but without Barthes\u2019s\npoststructuralist idiom, Stephen David Ross (1977) contends that there\nis no work of art simpliciter, but any number of discriminable\nachievements or loci of artistic value.\n\n\nAnders Pettersson (1981, 1984, 1990, 2009, 2012) contends that talk of\na text or literary work can be eliminated. He acknowledges that the\nconcept of a literary work forms part of ordinary language and is\nuseful in theoretically undemanding contexts, but he also argues that\nit is a self-contradictory construct that creates many pseudo-problems\nfor literary theory. We can say what we need to say about literature\nin a theoretically adequate way without making any ontological\ncommitments to texts or works and without introducing any new entities\nby referring to such phenomena as physical copies of texts, texts in\nthe sense of sequences of signs, or meaning in its different\nvarieties.\n\n\nA more recent proponent of an eliminativist strategy is Ross P. Cameron\n(2008), who contends that we need not make works of art part of our\nfundamental metaphysics. Even so, we can still hold our common\nsense statements about them to be true. For criticisms of the\nidea that this eliminativist position is compatible with common sense\nor well-entrenched practices, see Robert Stecker (2009) and Stefano\nPredelli (2009).\n",
