    "main_text": "Other Revolution Claims and Examples || Some Biological Cases\n6.2 Some Biological Cases\n\nThe account of the dynamics of science in Structure ill fit\nthe rapid splitting and recombining of fields in the post-World War II\nera of Big Science, as Kuhn recognized. So he excluded from his\naccount the division and recombination of already mature fields such\nas happened with the emergence of biochemistry. (This exclusion is\ntroubling, given the universal thrust of his account. It is as if Kuhn\nadmitted that his account applies only to a particular historical\nperiod that is now largely past; yet he also wrote as if the\nnormal-revolutionary model would apply to mature disciplines into the\nlong future.) In his later work he did devote careful attention to the\ndivision of fields into specialties and subspecialties (see \u00a75).\nHowever, he still gave little attention to the more-or-less reverse\nprocess of new fields coming into existence by combinations of\npreviously distinct fields as well as to cross- and trans-disciplinary\nresearch, in which a variety of different specialists somehow succeed\nin working together (Galison 1997, Kellert 2008, Andersen 2013).\n\nAnd what can we make, on Kuhn\u2019s account, of the explosion of\nwork in molecular biology following the Watson-Crick discovery, in\n1953, of the chemical structure of DNA and the development of better\nlaboratory equipment and techniques? Molecular genetics quickly grew\ninto the very general field of molecular biology. Less than two\ndecades after Watson and Crick, Gunther Stent could already write in\nhis 1971 textbook:\n\nHow times have changed! Molecular genetics has \u2026 grown from the\nesoteric specialty of a small, tightly knit vanguard into an\nelephantine academic discipline whose basic doctrines today form part\nof the primary school science curriculum. [Stent 1971, ix]\n\n\nThere is something paradigmatic about molecular biology and also\nsomething revolutionary about its rapid progress and expansion. It is\nnot clear how to characterize this and similar developments. Was this\na Kuhnian revolution? It did involve major social and intellectual\nreorganization, one that conflicted with the previous ones in some\nrespects but without undermining the Darwinian paradigm. Quite the\ncontrary. Or is molecular biology more like a style of scientific\npractice than a paradigm? Such an explosive development as molecular\nbiology hardly fits Kuhn\u2019s description of steady, normal\nscientific articulation of the new paradigm by puzzle solving.\nInstead, it seems better to regard it as a large toolkit of methods or\ntechniques applicable to several specialty fields rather than as an\nintegrative theory-framework within one field.\n\nShould we then focus on practices rather than on integrative theories\nin our interpretation of Kuhnian paradigms? The trouble with this move\nis that practices can also change so rapidly that it is tempting to\nspeak of revolutionary transformations of scientific work even though\nthere is little change in the overarching theoretical framework (see\nPart II of Soler et al. 2008). Moreover, as Baird (2004) points out,\nthe rapid replacement of old practices by new is often a product of\nefficiency rather than intellectual incompatibility. Why continue to\ndo gene sequencing by hand when automated processing in now available?\nReplacement can also be a product of change in research style, given\nthat, as Kuhn already recognized, scientific communities are cultural\ncommunities.\n\nSimilar points can be made about the rise of statistical physics,\nmentioned above in relation to Hacking\u2019s work. (See also Brush\n1983 and Porter 1986.) This was an explosion of work within the\nclassical mechanical paradigm rather than a slow, puzzle-by-puzzle\narticulation of precisely that paradigm in its own previous terms. Or\nwas it? For Kuhn himself recognized that modern mathematical physics\nonly came into existence starting around 1850 and that Maxwellian\nelectrodynamics was a major departure from the strictly Newtonian\nparadigm. In any case, there was much resistance among physicists to\nthe new style of reasoning. The kinetic theory of gases quickly grew\ninto statistical mechanics, which leapt the boundaries of its initial\nspecialty field. New genres as well as new styles of\nmathematical-physical thinking quickly replaced old\u2014and\ndisplaced the old generation of practitioners. Yet on Kuhn\u2019s\nofficial theory of science it was all just \u201cclassical\nmechanics.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the biological and chemical sciences do not readily\ninvite a Kuhnian analysis, given the usual, theory-centered\ninterpretation of Kuhn. For biological fields rarely produce lawful\ntheories of the kind supposedly found in physics. Indeed, it is\ncontroversial whether there exist distinctly biological laws at all.\nAnd yet the biological sciences have advanced so rapidly that their\ndevelopment cries out for the label \u2018revolutionary\u2019.\n\nWhat of the emerging field of evolutionary-developmental biology\n(evo-devo)? It is too soon to know whether future work in this\naccelerating field will merely complete evolutionary biology rather\nthan displacing it. It does seem unlikely that it will amount to a\ncomplete, revolutionary overturning of the Darwinian paradigm. (Kuhn\nmight reply that the discovery of homeobox genes overturned a smaller\nparadigm based on the expectation that the genetic makeup of different\norders of organisms would have little in common at the relevant level\nof description.) And if it complements the Darwinian paradigm, then\nevo-devo is, again, surely too big and too rapidly advancing to be\nconsidered a mere, piecemeal, puzzle-solving articulation of that\nparadigm. Based on work to date, evo-devo biologist Sean B. Carroll,\nfor example, holds precisely the complement view\u2014complementary\nyet revolutionary:\n\nEvo-Devo constitutes the third major act in a continuing evolutionary\nsynthesis. Evo-Devo has not just provided a critical missing piece of\nthe Modern Synthesis\u2014embryology\u2014and integrated it with\nmolecular genetics and traditional elements such as paleontology. The\nwholly unexpected nature of some of its key discoveries and the\nunprecedented quality and depth of evidence it has provided toward\nsettling previously unresolved questions bestow it with a\nrevolutionary character. [2005, 283]\n Eva Jablonka and Marion Lamb (2005) make even stronger\nKuhnian-revolutionary claims for evo-devo, which they see as a partial\nreturn to a Lamarckian perspective. It was in his review of their book\nthat Godfrey-Smith (2007) suggested that recent biological progress is\na deluge rather than a Kuhnian revolution.\n\n",
