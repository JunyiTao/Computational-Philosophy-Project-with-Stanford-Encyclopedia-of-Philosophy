Significance of Everyday Aesthetics\n\nAs the increasingly prevalent phenomenon of aestheticization of life\nindicates, the aesthetic has a significant power to influence,\nsometimes determine, the quality of life and society. While the power\nof everyday aesthetics can be harnessed to improve the quality of\nlife, it can also be used to serve a political agenda or a business\ngoal. As stated in the sections on the Everyday Aesthetic Qualities\nand Action-Oriented Aesthetics above, everyday aesthetic responses\noften guide people\u2019s actions in the most direct way. If\nsomething attracts us with its aesthetic appeal, we tend to protect\nit, purchase it, or try to maintain its aesthetic value; on the other\nhand, if we don\u2019t find an object or an environment aesthetically\nappealing, we tend to be indifferent to its fate, discard it, or try\nto make it more attractive (Nassauer 1995; Orr 2002). In particular,\ntoday\u2019s global capitalist economy is fueled by \u2018perceived\nobsolescence\u2019 regarding products\u2019 fashionableness and\nstylishness with little to no improvement in their functional values.\nAdditional aesthetic \u2018hidden persuaders\u2019 include branding,\nadvertising campaigns, and environments aesthetically orchestrated for\nstores (Pine and Gilmore 1998, 2013; Postrel 2003; Schulze 2013;\nB\u00f6hme 2017). These positive aesthetic values of and surrounding a\nproduct often hide various instances of \u2018ugliness\u2019\ninvolved in its manufacturing process and afterlife. The negative\naesthetics associated with manufacturing includes environmental\ndevastation caused by resource extraction and pollution, and dismal\nworking conditions of the factory workers, often in developing\nnations, who are forced to endure aesthetic deprivation, not to\nmention health and safety hazards. The negative aesthetics of the\nproduct\u2019s afterlife can be seen in the ever-increasing volume of\ndiscarded items, no longer considered trendy and fashionable, not only\nin municipal landfills but in the ocean. Such \u2018trash\u2019 is\nalso shipped to developing nations where re-usable, and often toxic,\nparts are harvested by local people with no protective gear (Saito\n2018b).\n\nNegative consequences of people\u2019s aesthetic preference can also\nbe found in the uniformly perfect appearance of fruits and vegetables\non the store shelf. The deformed and misshapen items are sometimes\ndiscarded, causing not only literal waste but also creation of methane\ngas from rotting produce. Some other times, a niche market emerges to\ndivert such imperfect items earmarked for free giveaway to the needy\nand to commodify them for cheap sale to the general public, thereby\nexacerbating the food insecurity of the vulnerable population. The\nAmerican attraction to the weed-free, velvety-smooth, uniformly green\nlawn has serious environmental ramifications, such as excessive water\nuse and chemical fertilizer, herbicide, and insecticide. When outdoor\nlaundry hanging and wind turbines are judged to be an eyesore,\ncommunities create an ordinance to prohibit them, preventing the\nopportunity to create a more sustainable way of living (Duerksen and\nGoebel 1999; Gipe 2002; Saito 2004, 2017a; Gray 2012). \n\nContrariwise, the success of sustainable design and goods produced\nunder humane conditions often depends upon the acceptance of new\naesthetic paradigms, such as gardens consisting of wildflowers or\nedible plants, garments and furniture made with recycled or reused\nmaterials, and green buildings that reduce literal footprints on the\nland as well as carbon footprints (Walker 2006, 2017; Salwa 2019).\nSome work has also been done to explore the ways in which moral\nvirtues such as respect, thoughtfulness, and humility can be expressed\nnot only by persons but also by the aesthetic features of objects and\nbuilt structures and environments (Norman 1990; Whiteley 1993, 1999;\nSep\u00e4nmaa 1995a, 1995b; Pallasmaa 1999; Taylor 2000; Orr 2002;\nBerleant 2005, 2010, 2012; Berleant and Carlson 2007; Saito 2007,\n2017a). In addition, as indicated by social aesthetics, cultivation of\naesthetic sensibility and practice of aesthetic skills can contribute\nto facilitating respectful, thoughtful, and humane social\ninteractions\n\nThe relationship between the aesthetic and the ethical has been one of\nthe contested issues in the aesthetics discourse regarding art.\nDebates ensue regarding the aesthetic relevance of the moral content\nof art, the artist\u2019s or performer\u2019s character, and the\nprocess involved in creating a work of art. The positions range from\ntheir complete separation supported by aestheticism to their\nintegration advocated by moralists. However, the ethical implications\nof art (at least in its more conventional form) do not have a\ndirect bearing on changing the world. They may affect the\naudience\u2019s perception, attitude, and worldview, which may lead\nthem toward a certain action, but the impact is indirect. In\ncomparison, the aesthetic impact of everyday affairs often leads to\ndirect consequences that change the state of the world. Just as in\nart-centered aesthetics, however, there are differing views on whether\nor not and to what degree the ethical implications should affect the\naesthetic value of the object. Some prefer to separate them and\nprotect the autonomous realm of the aesthetic (Forsey 2013). Others\nadvocate integration by calling for an aesthetic paradigm shift (Orr\n2002; Saito 2007, 2017a, 2018b; Maskit 2011) not only by explicitly\nincluding the moral dimensions of objects and environments in their\naesthetics but also by rethinking the fundamental ways in which we\nhumans interact with the material world. At least according to the\nWestern tradition, the material world lacks any agency in a morally\nrelevant sense and its value is exhausted by its instrumental utility\nto humans. However, just as the long-held Western anthropocentric\nattitude toward nature has come under scrutiny, some thinkers propose\na more respectful attitude toward and interaction with the material\nworld (Ingold 2000; Nielsen 2005; Brook 2012; Perullo 2016; Saito\n2018b).\n\nThe moral, social, and political significance of everyday aesthetics\nis perhaps most acute in body aesthetics. Culturally- and\nsocially-constructed, and often impossible to achieve, aesthetic\nstandards of the human body lead people to engage in various beauty\npractices, ranging from cosmetic surgery and extreme dieting to\ningestion of dangerous substances and bleaching of the skins, which\noften compromise health (Brand 2000, 2012; Lintott 2003; Rhode 2010;\nArcher and Ware 2018; Widdows 2018). Aesthetics is also implicated as\na primary instrument of justifying the societal oppression of\ndisabled, sexed, gendered, or racialized bodies. Those individuals\nwhose bodies do not meet the aesthetic standard suffer from an\nunfounded perception that their physical appearance correlates with\ntheir competence, intelligence, and moral character, and are subjected\nto many forms of injustice and discrimination in employment, social\nstanding, personal relationships, and economic status. Aesthetic\nqualifications for an ideal body can be explicitly institutionalized\nas in Nazism or policies requiring a certain appearance of employees,\nor implicitly referenced to reinforce the existing stereotype of the\noppressed groups (Garland-Thomson 2009; Siebers 2010; Irvin 2016; P.\nTaylor 2016; also see the entries on\n feminist perspectives on the body,\n feminist perspectives on disability, and\n feminist perspectives on objectification).\n \n\nThe utilization of aesthetics as a strategy for consumerism and\npolitical agenda has thus been a concern for everyday aesthetics.\nAesthetic appeal can entice people to embrace, support, and promote\nproblematic causes that may be ultimately contrary to their wellbeing\nand quality of life, as well as to the ideal of justice and democracy.\nInstead of nurturing citizens and civil society engaged in a\nthoughtful and informed exchange, discussion, and critical reflections\nof ideas, aestheticization of everyday life is often used to cultivate\nconsumers for the market, audience for political spectacles, and\naccomplices in perpetuating oppression and injustice. However, this\ndanger of aestheticization of everyday life is not necessarily\ninevitable. Some argue that it is possible and indeed critical that we\nencourage an aestheticization strategy in the service of promoting\njustice, democracy, citizenry, and civil discourse (Nielsen 2005;\nMatteucci 2017; Saito 2017a, 2018b).\n",
