Why Might Someone Believe God Grounds the Existence of Necessarily Existing Abstract Objects?\n\nThere are at least two sorts of reasons why someone might be inclined\nto think that God grounds the existence of necessarily existing\nabstract objects. The first sort of reason involves central religious\ntexts in monotheistic faiths like Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\nRoughly, this sort of reason consists in these texts\u2019 assertions\nor suggestions that God has created everything. If God created\neverything, it must be that God has created necessarily existing\nabstract objects, as well. Thus, God grounds the existence of these\nabstract objects. For instance, there are statements in the Hebrew\nBible such as Psalm 89:11: \u201cThe heavens are yours, the earth\nalso is yours; the world and all that is in it\u2014you have founded\n them\u201d.[4]\n Also in the Hebrew Bible is Nehemiah 9:6: \n\n\nAnd Ezra said: \u201cYou are the Lord, you alone; you have made\nheaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all\nthat is on it, the seas and all that is in them. To all of them you\ngive life, and the host of heaven worships you\u201d. \n\n\nIn the New Testament, there are passages like John 1:1\u20131:4: \n\n\nIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word\nwas God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being\nthrough him, and without him not one thing came into being. (The Word\n[logos in Greek] to which John refers is Jesus of Nazareth)\n\n\n\nPaul states in Colossians 1:15\u201316, \n\n\nHe [Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all\ncreation; for in him all things in heaven and on earth were created,\nthings visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers\nor powers\u2014all things have been created through him and for\nhim.\n\n\nOne of the most important documents for Christian faith outside the\nHebrew Bible and New Testament, the\n Nicene Creed\n of 325, says \u201cWe believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker\nof all things visible and invisible\u201d. The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed of 381,\n a modification of the older Nicene Creed of 325 that is used by the\nwestern Church begins similarly, \u201cWe believe in one God, the\nFather almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of all things that are\nvisible and invisible\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Qur\u2019an, \u201cGod is the Creator of all\nthings; He has charge of everything; the keys of the heavens and earth\nare His\u201d (39:62\u201363). The Qur\u2019an also says,\n\u201cThis is God, your Lord, there is no God but Him, the Creator of\nall things, so worship Him; He is in charge of everything \u201d\n (6:102).[5]\n\n\nThese reasons from authoritative religious texts may not be taken to\nbe conclusive, however. One may take these sorts of texts seriously as\nan adherent to faiths they define and still hold that God\ndoesn\u2019t have creative control over necessarily existing abstract\nobjects. For instance, Peter van Inwagen (2009) argues that the\nuniversal quantifier in claims like that of the Nicene Creed\n\u201cmaker of all things visible and invisible\u201d is implicitly\nrestricted to include only those things that are capable of being\ncreated. Necessarily existing abstract objects cannot enter into\ncausal relations and thus can\u2019t be created. But it is worth\nnoting that philosophers who think that if there are necessarily\nexisting abstract objects, God must have some sort of control over\nthem (e.g., Craig 2016) point to texts like those cited above for\njustification for this view.\n\nThere is a second sort of reasoning that may lead someone to think\nthat God grounds the existence of necessarily existing abstract\nobjects. That is by way of perfect being theology (see Morris\n1987a, 1987b and Nagasawa 2017 for\ndiscussion). Perfect being theology is a way of theorizing a\npriori about God that goes back at least to Anselm of Canterbury.\nOne begins with the claim that God is the greatest possible being, and\nfrom there one can derive attributes that God must have. This method\nis one way of arriving at God\u2019s being omnipotent, omniscient,\nand perfectly good. Anselm himself famously thought that via perfect\nbeing theology he could conclude that God existed. For our purposes\nhere, we are to imagine two conceptually possible beings: One being\nhas grounds or explains the existence of necessarily existing abstract\nobjects, and the other doesn\u2019t. We are to see that the being\nthat grounds these abstracta is greater than one who doesn\u2019t,\nand thus we are to conclude that God (the greatest possible being) has\ncontrol over necessarily existing abstract objects. Sometimes the\nintuition that the former being is greater than the latter is put in\nterms of God\u2019s aseity, or independence from all other\nentities. A being with maximal aseity is greater than one without it\n(other things being equal); and if necessarily existing abstract\nobjects don\u2019t depend on God, God lacks maximal aseity.\n\nThere likely would be little objection to reasoning to divine\ngrounding of necessarily existing abstracta in the above way, if\nit were thought that God could have control over these sorts of\nabstracta. However, someone might concur with van Inwagen that\nabstracta can\u2019t enter into causal relations, and say that the\nonly way that abstracta might be grounded in God is via causation. Or\nsomeone might think that the idea of a necessarily existing object\ndepending on anything is\n incoherent.[6]\n If one took either of these positions, one would deny that the being\nwho grounds necessarily existing abstract objects was greater than the\none who didn\u2019t. (Just as she would deny that a being who can\nmake a square circle is greater than one who can\u2019t\u2014there\ncan\u2019t be a being who can make a square circle.)\n\nWe have noted two sorts of reasons why a theist might think that God\ngrounds the existence of necessarily existing abstract objects. We\nturn to a discussion of some different answers to our central\nquestion: Does God ground the existence of necessarily existing\nabstract\n objects?[7]\n Each of the next two sections will begin with a list of views and\nwill follow with considerations for and against\n each.[8]\n",
