Mathematical Theories of Measurement (\u201cMeasurement Theory\u201d)\n\nMathematical theories of measurement (often referred to collectively\nas \u201cmeasurement theory\u201d) concern the conditions under\nwhich relations among numbers (and other mathematical entities) can be\nused to express relations among\n objects.[2]\n In order to appreciate the need for mathematical theories of\nmeasurement, consider the fact that relations exhibited by\nnumbers\u2014such as equality, sum, difference and ratio\u2014do not\nalways correspond to relations among the objects measured by those\nnumbers. For example, 60 is twice 30, but one would be mistaken in\nthinking that an object measured at 60 degrees Celsius is twice as hot\nas an object at 30 degrees Celsius. This is because the zero point of\nthe Celsius scale is arbitrary and does not correspond to an absence\nof\n temperature.[3]\n Similarly, numerical intervals do not always carry empirical\ninformation. When subjects are asked to rank on a scale from 1 to 7\nhow strongly they agree with a given statement, there is no prima\nfacie reason to think that the intervals between 5 and 6 and\nbetween 6 and 7 correspond to equal increments of strength of opinion.\nTo provide a third example, equality among numbers is transitive [if\n(a=b & b=c) then a=c] but empirical comparisons among physical\nmagnitudes reveal only approximate equality, which is not a transitive\nrelation. These examples suggest that not all of the mathematical\nrelations among numbers used in measurement are empirically\nsignificant, and that different kinds of measurement scale convey\ndifferent kinds of empirically significant information.\n\nThe study of measurement scales and the empirical information they\nconvey is the main concern of mathematical theories of measurement. In\nhis seminal 1887 essay, \u201cCounting and Measuring\u201d, Hermann\nvon Helmholtz phrased the key question of measurement theory as\nfollows: \n\n\n[W]hat is the objective meaning of expressing through denominate\nnumbers the relations of real objects as magnitudes, and under what\nconditions can we do this? (1887: 4) \n\n\nBroadly speaking, measurement theory sets out to (i) identify the\nassumptions underlying the use of various mathematical structures for\ndescribing aspects of the empirical world, and (ii) draw lessons about\nthe adequacy and limits of using these mathematical structures for\ndescribing aspects of the empirical world. Following Otto H\u00f6lder\n(1901), measurement theorists often tackle these goals through formal\nproofs, with the assumptions in (i) serving as axioms and the lessons\nin (ii) following as theorems. A key insight of measurement theory is\nthat the empirically significant aspects of a given mathematical\nstructure are those that mirror relevant relations among the\nobjects being measured. For example, the relation \u201cbigger\nthan\u201d among numbers is empirically significant for measuring\nlength insofar as it mirrors the relation \u201clonger than\u201d\namong objects. This mirroring, or mapping, of relations between\nobjects and mathematical entities constitutes a measurement scale. As\nwill be clarified below, measurement scales are usually thought of as\nisomorphisms or homomorphisms between objects and mathematical\nentities.\n\nOther than these broad goals and claims, measurement theory is a\nhighly heterogeneous body of scholarship. It includes works that span\nfrom the late nineteenth century to the present day and endorse a wide\narray of views on the ontology, epistemology and semantics of\nmeasurement. Two main differences among mathematical theories of\nmeasurement are especially worth mentioning. The first concerns the\nnature of the relata, or \u201cobjects\u201d, whose\nrelations numbers are supposed to mirror. These relata may be\nunderstood in at least four different ways: as concrete individual\nobjects, as qualitative observations of concrete individual objects,\nas abstract representations of individual objects, or as universal\nproperties of objects. Which interpretation is adopted depends in\nlarge part on the author\u2019s metaphysical and epistemic\ncommitments. This issue will be especially relevant to the discussion\nof realist accounts of measurement\n (Section 5).\n Second, different measurement theorists have taken different stands\non the kind of empirical evidence that is required to establish\nmappings between objects and numbers. As a result, measurement\ntheorists have come to disagree about the necessary conditions for\nestablishing the measurability of attributes, and specifically about\nwhether psychological attributes are measurable. Debates about\nmeasurability have been highly fruitful for the development of\nmeasurement theory, and the following subsections will introduce some\nof these debates and the central concepts developed therein.\n",
