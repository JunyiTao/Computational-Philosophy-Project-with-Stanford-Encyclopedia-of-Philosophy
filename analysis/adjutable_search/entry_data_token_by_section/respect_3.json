    "main_text": "Respect for Persons\n2. Respect for Persons\n\nPeople can be the objects or recipients of different forms of respect.\nWe can (directive) respect a person\u2019s legal rights, show\n(institutional) respect for the president by calling her \u201cMs.\nPresident,\u201d have a healthy (obstacle) respect (respekt)\nfor an easily angered person, (care) respect someone by cherishing her\nin her concrete particularity, (evaluatively) respect an individual\nfor her commitment to a worthy project, and accord one person the same\nbasic moral respect we think any person deserves. Thus, the idea of\nrespect for persons is ambiguous. Because both institutional respect\nand evaluative respect can be for persons in roles or position, the\nphrase \u201crespecting someone as an R\u201d might mean either\nhaving high regard for a person\u2019s excellent performance in the\nrole or behaving in ways that express due consideration or deference\nto an individual qua holder of that position. Similarly, the phrase\n\u201crespecting someone as a person\u201d might refer to appraising\nher as overall a morally good person, or acknowledging her standing as\nan equal in the moral community, or attending to her as the particular\nperson she is as opposed to treating her like any other human being.\nIn the literature of moral and political philosophy, the notion of\nrespect for persons commonly means a kind of respect that all people\nare owed morally just because they are persons, regardless of social\nposition, individual characteristics or achievements, or moral\nmerit.\n\nIn times past, it was taken for granted that respect for human beings\nwas a hierarchical notion; some humans, it was thought, have a higher\nmoral standing and a greater moral worth than others and so are\nmorally entitled to greater recognition respect. (Not just in times\npast \u2013 this is still the core of racism, sexism, and other forms\nof bigotry.) However, the modern understanding of respect for persons\nrests on the idea that all persons as such have a distinctive moral\nstatus in virtue of which we have unconditional obligations to regard\nand treat them in ways that are constrained by certain inviolable\nlimits. This is sometimes expressed in terms of rights: all persons,\nit is said, have a fundamental moral right to respect simply because\nthey are persons. Connected with this is the idea that all persons are\nfundamentally equal, despite the very many things that distinguish one\nindividual from another. All persons, that is, have the moral standing\nof equality in the moral community and are equally worthy of and owed\nrespect. Respect acknowledges the moral standing of equal persons as\nsuch and is also the key mode of valuing persons as persons.\n\nBut which kind of respect are all persons owed? It is obvious that we\ncould not owe every individual evaluative respect, let alone equal\nevaluative respect, since not everyone acts morally correctly or has\nan equally morally good character. Moreover, since reverential respect\nis an involuntary emotional response to something that is\n\u201cawesome,\u201d but we can\u2019t have a moral obligation to\nexperience an emotion, reverential respect can\u2019t be the kind we\nowe all persons. So, if it is true that all persons are owed or have a\nmoral right to respect just as persons, then the concept of respect\nfor person has to be analyzed as some form or combination of forms of\nmoral recognition respect. One analysis takes moral recognition\nrespect for a person as a person to involve recognizing that this\nbeing is a person, appreciating that persons as such have a\ndistinctive moral standing and worth, understanding this standing and\nworth as the source of moral constraints on one\u2019s attitudes, desires,\nand conduct, and viewing, valuing, and treating this person only in\nways that are appropriate to and due persons (Dillon 1997, 2010).\n",
