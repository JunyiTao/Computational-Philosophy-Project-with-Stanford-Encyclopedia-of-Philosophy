    "main_text": "Complex Properties || Structural Properties\n4.2 Structural Properties\n\nFollowing Armstrong (1978b: 68\u201371; see also Fisher 2018:\n\u00a72), a structural property \\(F\\) is typically viewed as a\nuniversal, and can be characterized thus:\n\nan object exemplifying \\(F\\), say \\(x\\), must have\n\u201crelevant\u201d proper parts that do not exemplify \\(F\\);\nthere must be some other \u201crelevant\u201d properties somehow\ninvolved in \\(F\\) that are not exemplified by the object in\nquestion;\nthe relevant proper parts must rather exemplify one or the other\nof the relevant properties involved in \\(F\\).\n\n\nFor instance, a molecule \\(w\\) exemplifying H2O\nhas as parts two atoms \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) and an atom \\(o\\) that do\nnot exemplify H2O; this property involves\nhydrogen and oxygen, which are not exemplified by\n\\(w\\); \\(h_1\\) and \\(h_2\\) exemplify hydrogen, and \\(o\\)\nexemplifies oxygen. For relational structural\nproperties, there is the further condition that\n\na certain \u201crelevant\u201d relation that links the relevant\nproper parts must also be involved.\n\n\nH2O is a case in point: the relevant (chemical)\nrelation is bonding, which links the three atoms in question.\nAnother, often considered, example is methane as a structural\nproperty of methane-molecules (CH4), which\ninvolves a bonding relation between atoms and the joint\ninstantiation of hydrogen (by four atoms) and carbon\n(by one atom). Non-relational structural properties do not\nrequire condition (iv). For instance, mass 1 kg involves many\nrelevant properties of the kind mass n kg, for \\(n \\lt 1\\),\nwhich are instantiated by relevant proper parts of any object that is\n1 kg in mass, and these proper parts are not linked by any relevant\nrelation (Armstrong 1978b: 70).\n\nIn most approaches, including Armstrong\u2019s, the relevant\nproperties and the relevant relation, if any, are conceived of as\nparts, or constituents, of the structural property in question, and\nthus their being involved in the latter is a parthood relation. For\ninstance, hydrogen, oxygen and bonding are\nconstituents of H2O. Moreover, the composition of\nstructural properties is isomorphic to that of the complexes\nexemplifying them. These two theses characterize what Lewis (1986a)\ncalls the \u201cpictorial conception\u201d. It is worth noting that\nstructural properties differ from conjunctive properties such as\nhuman and musician, in that the constituents of the latter\n(i.e., human and musician) are instantiated by\nwhatever entity exemplifies the conjunctive property (i.e., a human\nbeing who is also a musician), whereas the constituents of a\nstructural property (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen and\nbonding) are not instantiated by the entities that\ninstantiate it (e.g., H2O molecules).\n\nStructural properties have been invoked for many reasons. Armstrong\n(1978b:\u00a0ch. 22) appeals to them to explain the resemblance of\nuniversals belonging to a common class, e.g., lengths and colors.\nArmstrong (1988; 1989) also treats physical quantities and numbers\nthrough structural properties. The former involve, as in the above\nmass 1 kg example, smaller quantities such as mass 0.1\nkg and mass 0.2 kg (this view is criticized by Eddon\n2007). The latter are internal proportion relations between structural\nproperties (e.g., being a nineteen-electrons aggregate) and\nunit-properties (e.g., being an electron). Moreover,\nstructural properties have been appealed to in treatments of laws of\nnature (Armstrong 1989; Lewis 1986a), some natural kinds (Armstrong\n1978b, 1997; Hawley & Bird 2011), possible worlds (Forrest 1986),\nersatz times (Parsons 2005), emergent properties\n(O\u2019Connor & Wong 2005), linguistic types (Davis 2014), ontic\nstructural realism (Psillos 2012). However, structural universals have\nalso been questioned on various grounds, as we shall now see.\n\nLewis (1986a) raises two problems for the pictorial conception. First,\nit is not clear how one and the same universal (e.g.,\nhydrogen) can recur more than once in a structural universal.\nLet us dub this \u201cmultiple recurrence problem\u201d. Secondly,\nstructural universals violate the Principle of Uniqueness of\nComposition of classical\n mereology.\n According to this principle, given a certain collection of parts,\nthere is only one whole that they compose. Consider isomers, namely,\nmolecules that have the same number and types of atoms but different\nstructures, e.g., butane and isobutane\n(C4H10). Here, butane and\nisobutane are different structural universals. Yet, they\narise from the same universals recurring the same number of times. Let\nus dub this \u201cisomer problem.\u201d\n\nTwo further problems may be pointed out. First, even molecules with\nthe same number and types of atoms and the same structures may vary in\nvirtue of their spatial orientation (Kalhat 2008). This phenomenon is\nknown as chirality. How can structural properties account for\nit? Secondly, the composition of structural properties is restricted:\nnot every collection of properties gives rise to a structural\nproperty. This violates another principle of classical mereology: the\nPrinciple of Unrestricted Composition.\n\nLewis dismisses alternatives to the pictorial conception, such as the\n\u201clinguistic conception\u201d (in which structural universals\nare set-theoretic constructions out of simple universals) and the\n\u201cmagic conception\u201d\u00a0(in which structural universals\nare not complex and are primitively connected to the relevant\nproperties). Moreover, he also rejects the possibility of there being\namphibians, i.e., particularized universals lying between\nparticulars and full-fledged universals. Amphibians would solve the\nmultiple recurrence problem, as they would be identical with multiple\nrecurrences of single universals. For example, in methane,\nthere would be four amphibians of\u00a0hydrogen.\n\nTo reply to Lewis\u2019 challenges, two main strategies have been\nadopted on behalf of the pictorial conception: a non-mereological\ncomposition strategy, according to which structural properties do not\nobey the principles of classical mereology, and a mereology-friendly\nstrategy. Let us start with the former.\n\nArmstrong (1986) admits that the composition of structural universals\nis non-mereological. In his 1997, he emphasizes that states of affairs\ndo not have a mereological kind of composition, and views universals,\nincluding structural ones, as states of affairs-types which,\nas such, are not mereological in their composition. Structural\nuniversals themselves turn out to be state\u00a0of affairs-types of a\nconjunctive sort (1997: 34 ff.). To illustrate, let us go back to the\nabove example with H2O exemplified by the water\nmolecule \\(w\\). It involves the conjunction of these states of\naffairs:\n\natom \\(h_1\\) being hydrogen,\natom \\(h_2\\) being hydrogen,\natom \\(o\\) being oxygen,\n\\(h_1\\),\u00a0\\(h_2\\), and \\(o\\) being bonded.\n\n\nThis conjunction of states of affairs provides an example of a\nstate\u00a0of affairs-type identifiable with the structural universal\nH2O.\n\nIn pursuit of the non-mereological composition strategy, Forrest\n(1986; 2006; 2016) relies on logically compound properties, in\nparticular (in his 2016) conjunctive, existentially quantified and\nreflexive ones. Bennett (2013) argues that entities are part of\nfurther entities by occupying specific slots within the latter.\nParthood slots are distinct from each other. Therefore, which entity\noccupies which slot matters to the composition of the resultant\ncomplex entity. Hawley (2010) defends the possibility of there being\nmultiple composition relations. In a more general way, McDaniel (2009)\npoints out that the relation of structure-making does not obey some of\nthe principles of classical mereology. Mormann (2010) argues that\ndistinct categories (to be understood as in\n category theory)\n come together with distinct parthood and composition relations.\n\nAs regards the mereology-friendly strategy, it has been suggested that\nstructural properties actually include extra components accounting for\nstructures, so that the Principle of Uniqueness of Composition is\nsafe. Considering methane, Pag\u00e8s (2002) claims that\nsuch a structural property is composed of the properties\ncarbon and hydrogen, a bonding relation and\na peculiar first-order, formal relation between the atoms. According\nto Kalhat (2008), the extra component is a second-order arrangement\nrelation between the first-order properties. Ordering formal\nrelations\u2014together with causally individuated\nproperties\u2014are also invoked by McFarland (2018).\n\nAt the intersection of these strategies, Bigelow and Pargetter (1989,\n1991) claim that structural universals are internally relational\nproperties that supervene on first-order properties and relations and\non second-order proportion relations. Second-order proportion\nrelations are relations such as having four times as. They\nrelate first-order properties and relations. For example, in\nmethane, the relation having four times as relates\ntwo conjunctive properties: (i) hydrogen and being part of this\nmolecule; (ii) carbon and being part of this\nmolecule.\n\nCampbell (1990) solves the multiple recurrence problem and the isomer\nproblem by appealing to tropes. In methane, there are\nmultiple hydrogen tropes. In butane and isobutane,\ndistinct tropes entertain distinct structural relations.\n\nDespite Lewis\u2019 dismissal, a number of theories appeal to\namphibians (i.e., particularized universals lying between particulars\nand full-fledged universals) or, more precisely, to entities similar\nto amphibians. Fine (2017) suggests that structural properties should\nbe treated by invoking arbitrary objects (Fine 1985). Davis\u2019\n(2014) account of linguistic types as structural properties confronts\nthe problem of the multiple occurrence of one type, e.g.,\n\u201cdog\u201d, in another (e.g., \u201cevery dog likes another\ndog\u201d) (Wetzel 2009). In general, the idea that types are\nproperties of tokens is a natural one, although there are also\nalternative views on the matter (see entry on\n types and tokens).\n Be this as it may, Davis proposes that types cannot occur within\nfurther types as tokens: they can only occur as subtypes.\nTherefore, subtypes lie, like amphibians, between types and tokens.\nSubtypes are individuated by their positions in asymmetric wholes,\nwhereas they are primitively and non-qualitatively distinct in\nsymmetric ones. The approach could be extended to properties such as\nmethane, which would be taken to have four distinct\nhydrogen subtypes.\n",
