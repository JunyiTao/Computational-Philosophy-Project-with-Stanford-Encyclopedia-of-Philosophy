    "main_text": "Bridgman\u2019s ideas on operational analysis || Background and motivation\n1.1 Background and motivation\n\nPercy Williams Bridgman (1882\u20131961) was a physicist at Harvard\nUniversity whose pioneering work in the physics of high pressures was\nrewarded with a Nobel Prize in\n 1946.[2]\n His chief scientific contribution was made possible by technical\nprowess: in his laboratory Bridgman created pressures nearly 100 times\nhigher than anyone else had achieved before him, and investigated the\nnovel behavior of various materials under such high pressures. But\nBridgman was placed in a predicament by his own achievements: at such\nextreme pressures, all previously known pressure gauges broke down;\nhow was he even to know what levels of pressure he had in fact\nreached? (see Kemble, Birch and Holton 1970) As he kept breaking his\nown pressure records, Bridgman had to establish a succession of new\nmeasures fit for higher and higher pressures. Therefore it is no\nsurprise that he thought seriously about the groundlessness of\nconcepts where no methods were available for their measurement.\n\nAnother important stimulus to his philosophical thinking was his\nencounter with the revolutionary new physics of the early 20th\ncentury. Bridgman\u2019s concerns about the definition and meaning of\nscientific concepts were forged in the general climate of shock\nsuffered by physicists at that time from a barrage of phenomena and\ntheoretical ideas that were entirely alien to everyday expectations,\nculminating with quantum mechanics and its \u201cCopenhagen\u201d\ninterpretation. In a popular article, Bridgman wrote: \u201cif we\nsufficiently extend our range we shall find that nature is\nintrinsically and in its elements neither understandable nor subject\nto law\u201d (1929, 444).\n\nEspecially important for Bridgman\u2019s thinking was Albert\nEinstein\u2019s special theory of relativity. Bridgman credited an\nunexpected teaching assignment in 1914 for his first real encounter\nwith special relativity, which gave him considerable distress as he\ntried to clarify the confusing conceptual situation surrounding the\ntheory (Bridgman in Frank 1956, 76). At the heart of special\nrelativity was Einstein\u2019s recognition that judging the\nsimultaneity of two events separated in space required a different\noperation from that required for judging the simultaneity of two\nevents happening at the same place. Fixing the latter operation was\nnot sufficient to fix the former, so a further convention was\nnecessary, which Einstein supplied in the form of his operation of\nsending light beams from each of the events in question to the\nmidpoint between their locations, to see if they arrive there at the\nsame time. How superior this way of thinking was, compared to Isaac\nNewton\u2019s declaration that he would \u201cnot define Time,\nSpace, Place or Motion, as being well known to all\u201d (quoted in\nBridgman 1927, 4)! Bridgman felt that all physicists, including\nhimself, had been guilty of unthinking uses of concepts, especially on\nthe theoretical side of physics.\n\nBridgman\u2019s sentiment arising out of these reflections, however,\nwas not the familiar one of happy celebration of Einstein\u2019s\ngenius. He rather regretted the sorry state of physics which had\nnecessitated Einstein\u2019s revolution. Einstein showed what\ndangerous traps we could fall into by stepping into new domains with\nold concepts in an unreflective way. Anyone thinking in operational\nterms would have recognized from the start that the meaning of\n\u201cdistant simultaneity\u201d was not fixed unless an operation\nfor judging it was specified (Bridgman 1927, 10\u201316). In\nBridgman\u2019s view, Einstein\u2019s revolution would never have\nbeen necessary, if classical physicists had paid operational attention\nto what they were doing. He thought that any future toppling of\nunsound structures would become unnecessary if the operational way of\nthinking could quietly prevent such unsound structures in the first\nplace. Operational awareness was required if physics was not to be\ncaught off-guard again as it had been in 1905: \u201cWe must remain\naware of these joints in our conceptual structure if we hope to render\nunnecessary the services of the unborn Einsteins\u201d (Bridgman\n1927, 24).\n\nBridgman\u2019s impulse was to specify every possible detail of his\noperations, because any detail could make an important\ndifference. Note the following passage, inspired by the shock of\nlearning from the special theory of relativity that the measured\nlength of an object was not independent of its velocity:\n\nNow suppose we have to measure a moving street car. The simplest, and\nwhat we may call the \u201cna\u00efve\u201d procedure, is to board\nthe car with our meter stick and repeat the operations we would apply\nto a stationary body. Notice that this procedure reduces to that\nalready adopted in the limiting case when the velocity of the street\ncar vanishes. But here there may be new questions of detail. How\nshall we jump on to the car with our stick in hand? Shall we run\nand jump on from behind, or shall we let it pick us up in front? Or\nperhaps does now the material of which the stick is composed make a\ndifference, although previously it did not? All these questions must\nbe answered by experiment. (Bridgman 1927, 11; emphasis added)\n\n",
