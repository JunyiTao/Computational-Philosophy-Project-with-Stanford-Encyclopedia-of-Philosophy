    "main_text": "Falsafa: Neoplatonized Aristotelianism in the Islamic World || Time and Eternity\n2.6 Al-R\u0101z\u012b and Absolute Time and Space\n\nAs noted most of those working in the falsafa tradition drew\ntheir inspiration from Aristotle and his later commentators, the most\nnotable exception was the independent philosopher-physician Ab\u016b Bakr\nal-R\u0101z\u012b (ca. 864\u2013925 or 930), whose natural philosophy and cosmology\nhappily drew upon Arabic versions of Plato\u2019s Timeaus as well\nas certain non-Greek sources. Al-R\u0101z\u012b maintained that there were five\neternals: (1) the Creator, (2) the Universal Soul, (3) prime matter,\n(4) absolute time and (5) absolute space (understood as something like\nvoid space) (al-Razi 1939, 195\u2013215). The first three eternal\nprinciples find their counterparts in the natural philosophy of the\nNeoplatonizing Aristotelians in the Islamic world, whereas it is the\nlast two notions that truly set al-Razi apart from other medieval\nnatural philosophers.\n\nFor all of the philosophers we have treated time and place are\nrelative terms, which respectively depend on a motion and a situated\nthing for their very existence. In contrast, al-Razi argued that one\nhad to distinguish between the relative conception of these notions\nand the absolute conception. Thus he distinguished between time (a\nrelative temporal notion) and duration (an absolute temporal notion)\nas well as between place (a relative spatial notion) and void (an\nabsolute spatial notion). As absolute both duration and void are\nsubstances in the sense that they have an existence independent of\nanything else and thus in principle could exist if everything else\nfailed to exist.\n\nAs for the eternity of duration, al-Razi noted that time (the relative\ntemporal notion) is constantly perishing and coming to be inasmuch as\nall past time has ceased to be, while future time is constantly coming\nto be. In this case, time itself is changing, but every change\nrequires a duration during which it changes. If this duration itself\nunderwent change, there would need to be a further duration and so on\ninfinitely. To stop the regress al-Razi posited an unchanging\nduration, which is itself the precondition for the measured time of\nthose philosophers following Aristotle.\n\nAs for absolute space or void, we have seen how the Arabic-speaking\nphilosophers had closely linked place with something placed in it. Now\nif the space and what is placed in it were essentially correlatives as\nthe philosophers maintained, then, argued al-Razi, by imagining the\ndestruction of one correlate, one must likewise imaging the\ndestruction of the other. Let one imagine the destruction of the\nuniverse. The notion of void or empty space, claimed al-Razi, is not\ndestroyed along with imagined destruction of everything occupying it.\nThus void and what is placed in it are not correlatives like the\nphilosophers claimed. Hence one must distinguish between the notion of\nvoid space, which is not destroyed when one imagines the destruction\nof the universe, and the notion of place, which is destroyed when one\nimagines the destruction of the universe. The former is absolute,\nwhereas only the latter is relative.\n",
