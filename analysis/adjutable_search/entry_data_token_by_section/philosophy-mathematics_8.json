    "main_text": "Platonism || Naturalism and Indispensability\n3.2 Naturalism and Indispensability\n\nQuine formulated a methodological critique of traditional philosophy.\nHe suggested a different philosophical methodology instead, which has\nbecome known as naturalism (Quine 1969). According to\nnaturalism, our best theories are our best scientific\ntheories. If we want to obtain the best available answer to\nphilosophical questions such as What do we know? and\nWhich kinds of entities exist?, we should not appeal to\ntraditional epistemological and metaphysical theories. We should also\nrefrain from embarking on a fundamental epistemological or\nmetaphysical inquiry starting from first principles. Rather, we should\nconsult and analyze our best scientific theories. They contain, albeit\noften implicitly, our currently best account of what exists, what we\nknow, and how we know it.\n\nPutnam applied Quine\u2019s naturalistic stance to mathematical\nontology (Putnam 1972). At least since Galilei, our best theories from\nthe natural sciences are mathematically expressed. Newton\u2019s\ntheory of gravitation, for instance, relies heavily on the classical\ntheory of the real numbers. Thus an ontological commitment to\nmathematical entities seems inherent to our best scientific theories.\nThis line of reasoning can be strengthened by appealing to the Quinean\nthesis of confirmational holism. Empirical evidence does not bestow\nits confirmatory power on any one individual hypothesis. Rather,\nexperience globally confirms the theory in which the individual\nhypothesis is embedded. Since mathematical theories are part and\nparcel of scientific theories, they too are confirmed by experience.\nThus, we have empirical confirmation for mathematical theories. Even\nmore appears true. It seems that mathematics is indispensable to our\nbest scientific theories: it is not at all obvious how we\ncould express them without using mathematical vocabulary.\nHence the naturalist stance commands us to accept mathematical\nentities as part of our philosophical ontology. This line of\nargumentation is called an indispensability argument (Colyvan\n2001).\n\nIf we take the mathematics that is involved in our best scientific\ntheories at face value, then we appear to be committed to a form of\nplatonism. But it is a more modest form of platonism than\nG\u00f6del\u2019s platonism. For it appears that the natural sciences\ncan get by with (roughly) function spaces on the real numbers. The\nhigher regions of transfinite set theory appear to be largely\nirrelevant to even our most advanced theories in the natural sciences.\nNevertheless, Quine thought (at some point) that the sets that are\npostulated by ZFC are acceptable from a naturalistic point of view;\nthey can be regarded as a generous rounding off of the mathematics\nthat is involved in our scientific theories. Quine\u2019s judgement\non this matter is not universally accepted. Feferman, for instance,\nargues that all the mathematical theories that are essentially used in\nour currently best scientific theories are predicatively reducible\n(Feferman 2005). Maddy even argues that naturalism in the philosophy\nof mathematics is perfectly compatible with a non-realist view about\nsets (Maddy 2007, part IV).\n\nIn Quine\u2019s philosophy, the natural sciences are the ultimate\narbiters concerning mathematical existence and mathematical truth.\nThis has led Charles Parsons to object that this picture makes the\nobviousness of elementary mathematics somewhat mysterious (Parsons\n1980). For instance, the question whether every natural number has a\nsuccessor ultimately depends, in Quine\u2019s view, on our best\nempirical theories; however, somehow this fact appears more immediate\nthan that. In a kindred spirit, Maddy notes that mathematicians do not\ntake themselves to be in any way restricted in their activity by the\nnatural sciences. Indeed, one might wonder whether mathematics should\nnot be regarded as a science in its own right, and whether the\nontological commitments of mathematics should not be judged rather on\nthe basis of the rational methods that are implicit in mathematical\npractice.\n\nMotivated by these considerations, Maddy set out to inquire into the\nstandards of existence implicit in mathematical practice, and into the\nimplicit ontological commitments of mathematics that follow from these\nstandards (Maddy 1990). She focussed on set theory, and on the\nmethodological considerations that are brought to bear by the\nmathematical community on the question which large cardinal axioms can\nbe taken to be true. Thus her view is closer to that of G\u00f6del\nthan to that of Quine. In more recent work, she isolates two maxims\nthat seem to be guiding set theorists when contemplating the\nacceptability of new set theoretic principles: unify and\nmaximize (Maddy 1997). The maxim \u201cunify\u201d is an\ninstigation for set theory to provide a single system in which all\nmathematical objects and structures of mathematics can be instantiated\nor modelled. The maxim \u201cmaximize\u201d means that set theory\nshould adopt set theoretic principles that are as powerful and\nmathematically fruitful as possible.\n",
