Hume\u2019s official view is that\nbelief is independent of the will and something over which we have no\nmastery. In contrast, Descartes maintains that judgements are acts of\nthe will. Price thinks it is obvious that we cannot simply decide to\nbelieve something (1969: 225ff, 238), but we can decide to investigate\na question and decide what type of evidence to scrutinise, meaning\nthat we might deliberately incline ourselves to think a\ncertain way.\n\nHume and Descartes, however, don\u2019t dispute this possibility.\nDescartes affirms the freedom not to believe, given the\nchance of erroneous belief. Since we are free to remain agnostic, we\nare responsible for our errors, and not God, who is not a deceiver. On\nPrice\u2019s view, even if we cannot simply abandon a belief, such as\none\u2019s belief now that one is reading, we can \u201ctrain\nourselves\u201d (1969: 225) over time to refrain from forming such\nbeliefs. There are also abnormal subjects who form beliefs, e.g., that\nthey are made of paper, or are surrounded by impostors. We are, thus,\nnot impelled to form commonsensical beliefs (also 1930a: 26; 1930b:\n193f). Finally, Price (1969: 239f) criticises Hume, the philosopher he\nmost admired, for inconsistency. Hume stresses that beliefs are\ninvoluntary but also thinks that we can appreciate and respond to his\nsceptical arguments, if only for a short time.\n",
