In light of generics such as \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d,\nsome theorists have argued that generics involve quantification over\nrelevant individuals (actual or possible), where context\ndetermines which individuals are relevant (e.g., Schubert and\nPelletier 1987; Declerk 1991; Chierchia 1995). On such views, when we\nconsider a generic such as \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d, only the\nmature, fertile female ducks enter into our evaluation of the\nsentence, because, e.g., they are the only potential egg-layers. The\nquestion that arises is how exactly to determine which individuals are\nrelevant. Schubert and Pelletier (1987) offer a detailed discussion of\nhow some of these restrictions arise\u2014e.g., via presupposition,\nfocus, linguistic context, or explicit restriction as appropriate.\n\nTer Meulen (1986), Gerstner-Link (1988), and Cavedon and Glasbey\n(1994) offer treatments of generics in the framework of situation\nsemantics (Barwise and Perry 1983). On such views, generics express\nconstraints on situations\u2014e.g., \u201ctigers are\nstriped\u201d expresses the constraint that every situation involving\na tiger involves a striped tiger. Constraints are not reducible to the\nproperties of individuals (Cavedon and Glasbey 1994). The\ninterpretation of a generic on these views is relative to a given\ncontext (or \u201cchannel\u201d as they style it), so as on the\nabove views, generics such as \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d are\nevaluated only with respect to the female ducks (Cavedon and Glasbey\n1994).\n\nAs noted above, there are philosophical and empirical difficulties\n(Cimpian, Gelman et al. 2010; Leslie 2008; Khemlani et al. 2012)\nfacing any accounts that rely on domain restriction to handle generics\nsuch as \u201cducks lay eggs\u201d. For these accounts to succeed,\nthese difficulties would need to be addressed in more detail.\n",
