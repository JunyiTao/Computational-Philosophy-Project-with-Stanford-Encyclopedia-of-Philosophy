    "main_text": "\n\n\nPeter Damian, an eleventh-century monastic leader and Church\nreformer, has received a modest place in the historiography of early\nmedieval philosophy because of his little tract De divina\nomnipotentia. In this work, Damian treats two questions related to\nthe limits of divine power: can God restore virginity to a woman who\nhas lost it, and, can God change the past? Damian has often been\ndepicted as a thinker who, in his defense of divine omnipotence, went\nas far as denying the universal validity of the principle of\nnon-contradiction. For the most part, this depiction of Damian is\nunfounded. Nevertheless, De divina omnipotentia is an\ninteresting document related to the early developments of medieval\ndiscussion concerning modalities and divine omnipotence.\n",
