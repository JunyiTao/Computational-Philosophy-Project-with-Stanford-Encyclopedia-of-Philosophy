    "main_text": "Other Types of Jury Theorems || Social choice between multiple alternatives\n5.2 Social choice between multiple alternatives\n\nOne can state jury theorems that apply at once to several aggregation\nrules and choice problems, showing that almost nothing hinges on the\nclassic focus on binary choice and majority rule (Pivato 2017). More\nconcretely, List and Goodin (2001) analyse plurality rule over some\nfinite set of alternatives\n \\(\\mathcal{A}\\).[25]\n Adopting the simple standard of correctness (see\n Section 5.1),\n they show that the plurality outcome is asymptotically infallible\nunder essentially classical assumptions of independence, homogeneity,\nand competence. Specifically, given a correct alternative\n\\(a\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), the individuals must vote following independent\nand identical probabilities, and vote for the correct alternative\n\\(a\\) with higher probability than for each incorrect alternative.\nInterestingly, this correctness probability need not exceed 0.5, but\nonly exceed the probability of each incorrect vote. One may conjecture\nthat under these assumptions the plurality outcome is not only\nasymptotically infallible, but also increasingly reliable.\n",
