Passage 612A\u2013B and Damian\u2019s Reputation\n\n\nDamian\u2019s reputation as a thinker who denies the universal validity\nof the principle of non-contradiction goes back to a series of studies\nthat the German scholar J.A. Endres published early in the twentieth\ncentury (Endres 1906, Endres 1910, and some others). This notion is one\nof the central pieces in Endres\u2019s more comprehensive thesis about a\ncontroversy between \u201cdialecticians\u201d and\n\u201canti-dialecticians\u201d in the eleventh century \u2014\n\u201cdialecticians\u201d being thinkers with a rational tendency\nwhile \u201canti-dialecticians\u201d are suspicious of or hostile\ntowards use of secular arts in discussions related to Christian faith.\nPeter Damian is Endres\u2019s prime representative of the anti-dialectical\nattitude. Endres\u2019s interpretation of Damian\u2019s position ultimately\ndepends on a single passage in De divina omnipotentia, passage\n612A\u2013B (in the Migne edition). To better understand that passage, some\npreliminary remarks about the content and aim of De divina\nomnipotentia should be made. (However, see also\n Section 6.)\n\n\nIn De divina omnipotentia, Damian treats two questions\nrelated to divine power: Can God restore virginity to a woman who has\nlost it? Can God bring it about that what has been done has not been\ndone? These questions had been brought up at a mealtime discussion\nduring Damian\u2019s recent visit to the Abbey of Monte Cassino. The first\nquestion was suggested by a passage in a letter by Jerome which had\nbeen read aloud during one of the meals (596C\u2013D). Damian maintained the\nview of divine omnipotence and claimed that God can restore virginity.\nThe second question was suggested by the first one: some people asked\nDamian whether, in his view, God can undo the done; for example, can\nGod bring it about that Rome was never founded (601C)? The general\ntendency in Damian\u2019s treatment is clear: he aims at defending the\ndoctrine of divine omnipotence. It is also clear that Damian\u2019s answer\nto the first question is affirmative: he explicitly and emphatically\ndeclares that God can restore virginity to a woman who has lost it.\n\n\nGiven the information in the previous paragraph, one can construct\nthe following argument for the claim that Damian has to deny the\nuniversal validity of the principle of non-contradiction: (1) Damian\nmaintains that God can restore virginity to a woman who has lost it.\n(2) But restoration of virginity consists in removing those events in\nthe woman\u2019s past that are incompatible with her being a virgin. (3)\nTherefore, Damian has to maintain that God can undo what has been done.\n(4) But the undoing of what has been done involves a contradiction. (5)\nTherefore, Damian has to claim that the principle of non-contradiction\nis not universally valid.\n\n\nThis construction of Damian\u2019s view is not entirely unrelated to the\ntext of De divina omnipotentia. There is a passage in De\ndivina omnipotentia where Damian touches upon the connection\nbetween the question of restoring virginity, the question of undoing\nthe done, and the validity of the principle of non-contradiction, viz.\nthe very passage on which Endres based his view about Damian\u2019s\nposition. The passage reads as follows (the preceding sentences are\nalso included to provide the context):\nLet the quibbling of the impious question be once more put\nforth; let it also be seen from what root it was produced, for then the\nstream that ought to be engulfed by the ground lest it should flood and\nruin the rich fruits of sound faith may just dry out with its source.\nFor in order to prove that God could not restore a virgin after her\nlapse, they add, as if it were a consequence [of the original question]\n(quasi consequenter): for would even God be able to bring it\nabout that what has been done, has not been done? As if [it were so\nthat] if it is ever established that a virgin has been spoilt, it could\nnot happen that she would be intact again. This is assuredly true as\nfar as nature is concerned, and the opinion holds. Also, that something\nhas been done and that the very same thing has not been done cannot be\nthe case. These, to be sure, are contraries to each other in such a way\nthat if one of them is, the other cannot be. For of what has been it\ncannot truly be said that it has not been, and, the other way around,\nof what has not been it is not correctly said that it has been. For\ncontraries cannot coincide in one and the same subject. This\nimpossibility, then, (haec porro inpossibilitas) is indeed\nrightly affirmed if it is attributed to the lack of means of nature,\nbut on no account should it be applied to the divine majesty. For he\nwho has given birth to nature easily removes the necessity of nature\nwhen he wills. (611D\u2013612B).\n\n\nTowards the end of this passage, Damian appears to be saying that\nGod can restore virginity and undo what has been done even if it\nrequires that the principle of non-contradiction is violated. At least\nthis is how Endres interpreted the passage. According to Endres, Damian\ncounts the principle of non-contradiction among the laws of nature; as\nsuch, it belongs to the sphere of the contingent and cannot restrict\nthe agency of God Almighty. Because of this passage, the critique of\ndialectic and other secular arts that Damian presents elsewhere (see,\ne.g., 603C\u2013604A, 610D\u2013611D) acquires a new significance. Damian was not\nsatisfied with simply criticizing the misplaced and mistaken use of\ndialectic in theology; he aimed at denying the possibility of science\nexisting independent of theology (Endres 1906, 30\u201331; 1910, 23\u201330).\n\n\nRecent commentators disagree about the correct interpretation of\n612A\u2013B, but none of them find Endres\u2019s conclusions justified (see,\ne.g., Gonsette 1956, 100\u2013101; Cantin 1972, 139\u2013140, 173\u2013176, 203\u2013206;\nRemnant 1978, 260\u2013261; Resnick 1992, 110\u2013111; Knuuttila 1993, 65\u201366;\nHolopainen 1996, 36\u201339, 42; Gaskin 1997, 232\u2013233, 240\u2013243; closest to\nEndres\u2019s view comes Bauke-Ruegg 1998, 443\u2013451). The problem with\nEndres\u2019s reading of 612A\u2013B is that it fits badly with what Damian says\nelsewhere in De divina omnipotentia. Namely, Damian rejects\nas outrageous the suggestion that God could bring about something that\nviolates the principle of non-contradiction (see\n Section 5.1).\n Either Endres\u2019s reading of 612A\u2013B is\naltogether wrong, or at least the passage does not have the weight that\nEndres wants to give it.\n\n\nThere is a curious feature in Damian\u2019s idea about restoring\nvirginity. Damian talks about kinds of restoration of virginity that do\nnot require any interfering with past events (see\n Section 4).\n This is significant because it ruins our constructed argument\nfor the claim that Damian has to deny the universal validity of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction (above, steps [1]\u2013[5]). If Damian does\nnot share the assumption that restoration of virginity consists in\nremoving some events in the past (step [2]), then the two questions in\nDe divina omnipotentia can be treated and answered separately.\nEven though Damian affirms the possibility of restoring virginity, he\nneed not affirm the possibility of undoing the done.\n\n\nPassage 612A\u2013B (or 611D\u2013612B) appears to be connected to this issue.\nThe beginning of the passage shows that Damian intends to make a point\nabout the relation (or unrelatedness) of the two questions in De\ndivina omnipotentia. (By \u201cimpious question\u201d Damian\nmeans the question about undoing the done.) From 612B onwards, Damian\ndiscusses God\u2019s power to reverse the laws of nature and arrives at the\nconclusion that God can restore virginity through a miracle within some\npresent moment of time (cf.\n Section 4).\n As for\nDamian\u2019s claim about \u201cthis impossibility\u201d (haec ...\ninpossibilitas), which applies to nature but not to God, it is not\nclear whether he refers to the impossibility of bringing about\nsomething that violates the principle of non-contradiction or the\nimpossibility of restoring virginity. If he refers to the latter, his\npoint would be to say that God can restore virginity even though it is\nnot possible to undo the done (Holopainen 1996, 36\u201339).\n\n\nPassage 612A\u2013B is too ambiguous to support any substantial claims\nabout Damian\u2019s view; Damian does not deserve his reputation as a\nthinker who denies the universal validity of the principle of\nnon-contradiction in order to defend the divine omnipotence. (At the\nsame time, it must be added that Damian is not quite clear about the\nvalidity of the principle of non-contradiction for those things for\nwhich God is not responsible. See\n Section 5.1.)\n",
