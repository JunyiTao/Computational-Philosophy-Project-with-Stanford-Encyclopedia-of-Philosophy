On the terms \u2018Ethics\u2019 and \u2018Morality\u2019\n\n\nThe term \u2018ethics\u2019 is technically used by philosophers to\nmean a philosophical study of morality\u2014morality understood as a\nset of social rules, principles, norms that guide or are intended to\nguide the conduct of people in a society, and as beliefs about right\nand wrong conduct as well as good or bad character. Even though\nmorality is the subject matter of ethics, it is most often used\ninterchangeably with \u2018ethics\u2019. In spite of the\nphilosophical inquiries or analyses undertaken by individual\nmoral philosophers regarding morality (i.e., the morality of a\nsociety or people)\u2014analyses which often result in diverse positions or\nconclusions\u2014nevertheless, the basic features, the core elements\nof the morality of a society, those moral principles and values that\nactually guide and influence the lives of a people, remain pretty much\nwhat they are or have been. What individual moral philosophers, through\ntheir critical analyses and arguments, try to do is to explain,\nclarify, refine, sharpen, or enlarge the understanding of the concepts\nand issues of morality. Even though the moral beliefs and circumstances\nof their own societies constitute the immediate focus of their\nphilosophical activities\u2014for human experience is most directly\nfelt within some specific social or cultural\ncontext\u2014nevertheless, moral philosophers do not think or imply at\nall that the results of their reflective activities are to be tethered\nto their own societies as such. They believe, to the contrary, that, in the\nlight of our common humanity, which speaks to the common sentiments,\npurposes, responses, hopes, and aspirations of all human beings in\nrespect of certain situations, the conclusions of their reflections\nwould, surely, have implications for the capacious community of humankind, for\nthe universal human family.\n\n\nThus, moral principles and rules may emerge from or evolved by a\nparticular human society; even so, they are principles that\ncan\u2014and do\u2014apply to all human societies inasmuch as they\nrespond to basic human needs, interests, and purposes. When the Akan\nmoralist maintains, for instance, that \u2018To possess virtue is\nbetter than gold\u2019, or \u2018When virtue founds a town, the town\nthrives and abides\u2019, he strongly believes that he is making a\nmoral statement\u2014he is enunciating a moral principle\u2014that\ntranscends his own community and applies not only to other towns in his\nnation but, indeed, to all human societies, just as Socrates\nsurely intended his celebrated moral statement \u2018Virtue is\nknowledge\u2019 (whether true or not) to apply to peoples and cultures\nbeyond Athens and Greece, even beyond fifth century Greece. Thus, the\nmoral intent of the morally-freighted proverbs (or maxims) discussed in this entry\nis considered relevant to the moral life of the human being and, as\nsuch, is purported to have universal application or reference.\n\n\nAfter the reflective activities of the individual moral thinkers, the\nbeliefs and presuppositions of a people about right and wrong conduct,\ngood and bad character\u2014all of which featured in the moral life\nof the people prior to the activities of moral thinkers\u2014remain\nsubstantially or generally unscathed; they continue to constitute the\nmoral framework within which the members of the society\nfunction. Thus, even though a theoretical (or, academic) distinction\ncan be made between morality as constituted by the moral beliefs and\nprinciples that a group of people abides by in their daily lives (let\nus refer to this kind of morality as morality1) and\nmorality or ethics as comprising the reflections of moral thinkers on\nhuman conduct, on morality1 (let us refer to the reflective\nenterprise regarding morality as morality2), nevertheless,\nto the extent that morality2 provides a clarification and\nbetter explanation and understanding of morality1, it can\nbe said that the two terms, morality and ethics, refer essentially to\nthe same moral phenomenon\u2014human conduct\u2014and, thus, can be\nused interchangeably. Thus, in this entry, the term \u2018African\nethics\u2019 is used to refer both to the moral beliefs and\npresuppositions of the sub-Saharan African people and the\nphilosophical clarification and interpretation of those beliefs and\npresuppositions.\n\n\nI take note of a view expressed by some philosophers on\nAristotle's ethics: Bertrand Russell observed that\n\u201cAristotle's opinions on moral questions are always such as\nwere conventional in his day\u201d (1945: 174). This view is re-echoed\nby Hardie: \u201c[Aristotle's] moral ideas and moral ideals are,\nin some degree, the product of his time\u201d (1968: 120); he also\nasserts that \u201cAristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics is at\nleast in part an interpreter of Greek experience\u201d (W. F. R\nHardie, 1968: 123). In the same way, this entry present an\ninterpretretation of the moral ideas and values as found in the\nAfrican moral language, conceptions of society, conceptions of a\nperson, and so on.\n\n\nAlso, in this entry, \u2018African\u2019 refers to the salient\nfeatures or ideas of the African moral life and thought generally as\nreflected in, or generated by, African moral language and social\nstructure and life.  Many writers have made the observation that\ndespite the indisputable cultural diversity that arises from Africa's\nethnic pluralism, there are underlying affinities in many areas of the\nAfrican life; this is surely true in the African religious and moral\noutlook. There are some features of the moral life and thought of\nvarious African societies that, according to the cited sources, are\ncommon or shared features. There are other features that can be seen\nas common on conceptual or logical grounds. For instance, the claim\nthat the values and principles of African morality are not founded on\nreligion simply derives from the characterization of traditional\nAfrican religion as a non-revealed religion. (In the history\nof the indigenous religion in African, it does not seem that anyone in\nany African community, has ever claimed to have received a revelation\nfrom the Supreme Being intended either for the people of the community\nor for all humanity). This characterization makes African ethics\nindependent of religion and, thus, underlines the notion of the\nautonomy of ethics in regard to African ethics. If a religion is a\nnon-revealed religion, then it is independent of religious\nprescriptions and commands. The characterization of traditional\nAfrican religion would, thus, lead me to assert\u2014to generalize on\nlogical grounds\u2014that the moral system of each African\nsociety\u2014in the traditional setting\u2014does not derive from\nreligion: thus, it is an autonomous moral system. Similarly, the claim\nabout the social (non-individualistic) morality of the African society\nis closely related to the community and shared life of the African\npeople. And so on.\n\n\nThus, while Akan ethics is not a microcosm of African ethics, there is\nnevertheless evidence, both empirical and conceptual, that indicates\nthat the values, beliefs, and principles of Akan ethics\nreverberate mutatis mutandis on the moral terrains of other\nAfrican societies. Based on the qualifying expression mutatis\nmutandis (\u2018allowing for necessary variations and\nadjustments\u2019), it would be correct to say that the term\n\u2018African ethics\u2019 is appropriate. With all this said,\nhowever, neither Akan nor African ethics would be unique among the\nethical systems evolved by the various non-African cultures of the\nworld.\n",
