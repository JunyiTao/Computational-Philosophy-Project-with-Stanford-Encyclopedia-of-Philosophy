    "main_text": "Acquaintance and Noninferential Knowledge\n3. Acquaintance and Noninferential Knowledge\n\nFoundationalism regarding justification is often motivated by some\nversion of the regress argument. (Foundationalism regarding knowledge\ncan be motivated by a parallel version of the regress argument, put in\nterms of knowledge rather than justification.) The argument goes\nroughly as follows. By definition, any belief B that is an\ninstance of nonfoundational or inferential justification must depend\non some inference or inferential relation to other beliefs. It seems\nthat this dependence on other beliefs must take one of four forms: (i)\nthe belief depends inferentially on other beliefs, and the latter\nbeliefs on yet other beliefs, to infinity; (ii) the inference\neventually loops back to belief B, so that B depends on\nitself for its justification; (iii) the belief ultimately depends on\nother beliefs that are not themselves justified; or (iv) the belief\nultimately depends on a foundationally justified belief: a belief that\nis justified but that does not depend on other beliefs for its\njustification. The foundationalist argues that each of the\nalternatives to (iv) is seriously problematic: (i) An infinite regress\nis vicious, and even if it isn\u2019t, this is no help for finite\nminds like our own. (ii) Circular reasoning is vicious; one cannot\ndepend, even in part, on a belief that p in order to justify\nbelieving that p. (iii) One cannot generate justification by\nrelying on unjustified beliefs (\u201cgarbage in, garbage\nout!\u201d). So that leaves (iv): if any of our beliefs are\njustified, then they must either be foundationally justified or\ndepend, ultimately, on foundational beliefs for their\njustification.\n\nSome worry that (iv) is no better, and possibly worse, than the\nalternatives: how could a belief be justified, or be an instance of\nknowledge, without depending on other beliefs? The acquaintance\ntheorists seems to have an answer: acquaintance with facts is designed\nto end the potentially vicious regress of justification. But how\nexactly do we get noninferential knowledge or justified belief out of\nacquaintance? An acquaintance theorist who accepts the correspondence\ntheory of truth can provide a relatively straightforward answer. On\nwhat is surely the classical conception of truth, truth consists in\ncorrespondence between the truth bearer (the proposition, thought, or\nbelief) and the representation-independent fact to which that truth\nbearer corresponds (see the entry on\n the correspondence theory of truth).\n The question of what constitute the primary bearers of truth value is\na matter of enormous controversy. Suppose, though, for this discussion\nthat it is a thought that is the primary bearer of truth value\n(sentences are derivatively true or false when they express thoughts\nthat are true or false).\n\nOn a simple version of this view (perhaps too simple to have any\ncontemporary proponents, but an instructive place to start), we have\nnoninferential or foundational knowledge that P if and only\nif we have the thought that P while we are directly\nacquainted with the fact that P\u2014i.e., a truth-maker of\nthe thought that P. So if I am the kind of being who has the\nconceptual sophistication to form thoughts, and I have the thought\nthat I am in pain while I am acquainted with the fact that I am in\npain, I have the most secure and basic sort of knowledge of truth.\n\nWe said earlier that acquaintance is not itself judgmental or\npropositional, and so does not have truth value\u2014it is a form of\nawareness of something, not awareness that something\nis so-and-so. However, this leaves open the possibility that the\nobject or target of acquaintance\u2014that with which one is\nacquainted\u2014be propositional or have truth value. If I am\nacquainted with the proposition or thought that I am in pain then I am\nacquainted with something that has truth value, even though\nacquaintance itself is not to be understood as propositional in\nnature. The simple view we are considering might hold that one has\nfoundational knowledge that one is in pain if, in addition to being\nacquainted with one\u2019s being in pain, one is also acquainted with\nthe thought or proposition that one is in pain. \n\nThis view of how we get from acquaintance to noninferential knowledge\nor justified belief is problematic, however. First, the account seems\ntoo weak, for acquaintance with a fact that corresponds to a thought\nis not sufficient for justification, let alone knowledge.\nSuppose that I am aware of the fact of there being a decagon in my\nvisual field. Suppose that I also believe that there is a decagon\nin my visual field, but my belief is little more than a lucky guess,\nor that I only believe this because I think there always is a decagon in my visual field. Intuitively, the belief is not justified.\nSecond, the account seems too strong, for the requirement that\none\u2019s thought correspond to reality rules out the possibility of\nfalse noninferentially justified belief. The resulting\ninfallibilism regarding foundational belief is a prima facie\nimplausible requirement, and arguably has radically skeptical\nconsequences. This second problem will be taken up later, in\n section 6.\n\nContemporary acquaintance theorists have defended more sophisticated\nversions of the view. In response to the first problem, the\nacquaintance theorist can agree that in order to be justified it is\nnot enough that the subject be acquainted with a fact that happens to\ncorrespond to what is believed. It will be useful to divide the\nresponses into two broad camps, introduced in the next two\nsub-sections: those that require, in addition to acquaintance with\nsome fact, some sort of awareness of the correspondence between the\nthought and what it is about (or perhaps awareness of some other\nepistemically relevant relation\u2014see the end of\n section 6),\n and those that require that the beliefs involve demonstrative or\nphenomenal concepts. \n",
