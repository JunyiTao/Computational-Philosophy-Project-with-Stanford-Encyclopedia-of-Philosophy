    "main_text": "The Ethics of Vote Buying\n5. The Ethics of Vote Buying\n\nMany citizens of modern democracies believe that vote buying and\nselling are immoral (Tetlock 2000). Many philosophers agree; they\nargue it is wrong to buy, trade, or sell votes (Satz 2010: 102; Sandel\n2012: 104\u20135). Richard Hasen reviews the literature on vote\nbuying and concludes that people have offered three main arguments\nagainst it. He says,\n\nDespite the almost universal condemnation of core vote buying,\ncommentators disagree on the underlying rationales for its\nprohibition. Some offer an equality argument against vote buying: the\npoor are more likely to sell their votes than are the wealthy, leading\nto political outcomes favoring the wealthy. Others offer an efficiency\nargument against vote buying: vote buying allows buyers to engage in\nrent-seeking that diminishes overall social wealth. Finally, some\ncommentators offer an inalienability argument against vote buying:\nvotes belong to the community as a whole and should not be alienable\nby individual voters. This alienability argument may support an\nanti-commodification norm that causes voters to make public-regarding\nvoting decisions. (Hasen 2000: 1325)\n\n\nTwo of the concerns here are consequentialist: the worry is that in a\nregime where vote-buying is legal, votes will be bought and sold in\nsocially destructive ways. However, whether vote buying is destructive\nis a subject of serious social scientific debate; some economists\nthink markets in votes would in fact produce greater efficiency\n(Buchanan and Tullock 1962; Haefele 1971; Mueller 1973; Philipson and\nSnyder 1996; Hasen 2000: 1332). The third concern is deontological: it\nholds that votes are just not the kind of thing that ought be for\nsale, even if it turned out that vote-buying and selling did not lead\nto bad consequences.\n\nMany people think vote selling is wrong because it would lead to bad\nor corrupt voting. But, if that is the problem, then perhaps the\npermissibility of vote buying and selling should be assessed on a\ncase-by-case basis. Perhaps the rightness or wrongness of individual\nacts of vote buying and selling depends entirely on how the vote\nseller votes (J. Brennan 2011a: 135\u2013160; Brennan and Jaworski\n2015: 183\u2013194). Suppose I pay a person to vote in a good way.\nFor instance, suppose I pay indifferent people to vote on behalf of\nwomen\u2019s rights, or for the Correct Theory of Justice, whatever\nthat might be. Or, suppose I think turnout is too low, and so I pay a\nwell-informed person to vote her conscience. It is unclear why we\nshould conclude in either case that I have done something wrong,\nrather than conclude that I have done everyone a small public service.\n\n\nCertain objections to vote buying and selling appear to prove too\nmuch; these objections lead to conclusions that the objectors are not\nwilling to support. For instance, one common argument against voting\nselling is that paying a person to vote imposes an externality on\nthird parties. However, so does persuading others to vote or to vote\nin certain ways (Freiman 2014: 762). If paying you to vote for\nX is wrong because it imposes a third party cost, then for the\nsake of consistency, I should also conclude that persuading you to\nvote for X, say, on the basis of a good argument, is equally\nproblematic. \n\nAs another example, some object to voting markets on the grounds that\nvotes should be for the common good, rather than for narrow\nself-interest (Satz 2010: 103; Sandel 2012: 10). Others say that\nvoting should \u201cbe an act undertaken only after collectively\ndeliberating about what it is in the common good\u201d (Satz 2010:\n103). Some claim that vote markets should be illegal for this reason.\nPerhaps it\u2019s permissible to forbid vote selling because\ncommodified votes are likely to be cast against the common good.\nHowever, if that is sufficient reason to forbid markets in votes, then\nit is unclear why we should not, e.g., forbid highly ignorant,\nirrational, or selfish voters from voting, as their votes are also\nunusually likely to undermine the common good (Freiman 2014:\n771\u2013772). Further these arguments appear to leave open that a\nperson could permissibly sell her vote, provided she does so after\ndeliberating and provided she votes for the common good. It might be\nthat if vote selling were legal, most or even all vote sellers would\nvote in destructive ways, but that does not show that vote selling is\ninherently wrong.\n\nOne pressing issue, though, is whether vote buying is compatible with\nthe secret ballot (Maloberti 2018). Regardless of whether vote buying\nis enforced through legal means (such as through enforceable\ncontracts) or social means (such as through the reputation mechanism\nin eBay or through simply social disapproval), to enforce vote buying\nseems to require that voters in some way actively prove they voted in\nvarious ways. But, if so, then this will partly eliminate the secret\nballot and possibly lead to increased clientelism, in which\npoliticians make targeted promises to particular bands of voters\nrather than serve the common good (Maloberti 2018).\n\nNot all objections to vote-buying have this consequentialist flavor.\nSome argue that vote buying is wrong for deontological grounds, for\ninstance, on the grounds that vote buying in some way is incompatible\nwith the social meaning of voting (e.g. Walzer 1984). Some view voting\nis an expressive act, and the meaning of that expression is\nsocially-determined. To buy and sell votes may signal disrespect to\nothers in light of this social meaning.\n",
