The controversial\nconverse, The Identity of Indiscernibles, says that things that share all of their properties are identical. If \u201cproperty\u201d is\nunderstood sufficiently liberally, then the latter principle is certainly\ntrue\u2014any object b has the property of \u201cbeing\nidentical to b\u201d, and if c also has that property\nthen \\(b = c\\). The question is whether the principle holds with any\nmore restricted sense of property. Ladyman et al.(2012) discuss and relate different interpretations of indiscernibility associated with various senses of properties. Many of these interpretations would ground different versions of the identity of indiscernibles principle. (See the entry on this principle for philosophical perspectives other than those considered by Ladyman et al.(2012).) \n \nOne might closely link indiscernibility to the notion of a criterion of identity (together with its connection to sortals) when \u201ccriterion of identity\u201d is understood as follows:\n\nFor any sortal F there is a set of properties \\(\\phi\\) such that\nif b and c both are F, then if b and c\ninstantiate exactly the same properties in \\(\\phi\\) then \\(b = c\\).\n\nSome attempts to give content to the phrase \u201ccriterion of\nidentity\u201d can be understood in this framework. Black (1952)\nargues that purely internal properties of objects do not suffice; his\nexample is a universe with two spheres which share all of their\ninternal properties, i.e., are the same color, weight, composition,\netc. There are a wide range of philosophical views about criteria of\nidentity. Brody (1980) takes the two identity and indiscernibility\nprinciples as jointly definitive of identity and consequently\nargues that no further criteria of identity are required. Baker (1997)\nargues that there are no criteria of identity across time, while\nJubien (1996), Merricks (1998) and Zimmerman (1998) articulate reasons\nto doubt that there are any criteria of identity. Lowe (1989,1997, and 2009) are\nmore recent attempts to clarify the concept\n",
