    "main_text": "The History of Occasionalism || Berkeley\n1.5 Berkeley\n\nThe extent of George Berkeley\u2019s occasionalism is also a matter\nof some controversy. But there is general agreement among interpreters\nthat Berkeley was an occasionalist with regard to the causal powers of\nphysical objects. That is, physical objects for Berkeley are not\ncausally active in bringing about any events in the world. This denial\nis not surprising, if we consider the basic makeup of physical objects\nin Berkeley\u2019s ontological scheme, along with his views about the\npassivity of ideas. For, according to Berkeley, physical objects,\nproperly understood, are but bundles or collections of ideas, and\nideas are manifestly passive\u2014no power or activity is perceived\nin them (PHK\n 25).[8]\n\nIn De Motu, Berkeley also argues for the causal passivity of\nbodies in a more traditional manner, where he does not rely on his\nviews about the nature of physical objects as collections of\nideas:\n\n\nToday indeed Cartesian philosophers recognize God as the principle of\nnatural motions. And Newton everywhere frankly intimates that not only\ndid motion originate from God, but that still the mundane system is\nmoved by the same action. This is agreeable to Holy Scripture; this is\napproved by the opinion of the Schoolmen; for though the Peripatetics\ntell us that nature is the principle of motion and rest, yet they\ninterpret natura naturans to be God. They understand of\ncourse that all the bodies of this mundane system are moved by\nAlmighty Mind according to a settled and unchanging plan. (De\nMotu 32)\n\nModern thinkers consider motion and rest in bodies as two states of\nexistence in either of which every body, without pressure from\nexternal force, would naturally remain passive; whence one might\ngather that the cause of the existence of bodies is also the cause of\ntheir motion and rest. For no other cause of the successive existence\nof the body in different parts of space should be sought, it would\nseem, than that cause whence is derived the successive existence of\nthe same body in different parts of time. (De Motu 34)\n\n\nHere Berkeley seems to be arguing that the proper understanding of how\nGod relates to bodies and their motion would naturally lead us to\nconclude that all bodies are causally passive. The passive nature of\nbodies in this argument does not depend on their status as collections\nof ideas, but rather follows from the fact that the cause of the\nexistence of bodies is identical to the cause of the motion and rest\nof bodies, namely, God. In the background appears to be the widely\nheld theological principle that \u201cconservation is but continuous\ncreation\u201d, which, as we shall see, was most forcefully presented\nby Malebranche.\n\nHow then would Berkeley account for the apparent interaction between\nphysical objects we common experience, such as the stove in my kitchen\nboiling a pot of water? According to Berkeley, this phenomenon is to\nbe understood as God causing the relevant sensations in us in a\nregular fashion, and this regularity underwrites what we typically\ntake to be the laws of nature (PHK\n 30).[9]\n Thus, within the domain of physical objects, Berkeley appears to\nthink that God is the unique genuine cause, consistent with our\ncharacterization of occasionalism. There has been, however, some\ncontroversy in recent secondary literature as to whether one\u2019s\nown body is to be included in this domain of physical objects. Some\n(such as McDonough 2008) have argued against this inclusion, while\nothers (such as Lee 2012) have argued that we, as finite spirits, have\nno genuine causal input in the movement of our own bodies, and such\nmovement is directly caused by God like any other physical object for\n Berkeley.[10]\n\n\nDespite this clear occasionalist stance toward physical objects,\nBerkeley, as has been pointed out, firmly maintains that spirits, both\ninfinite and finite, are causally active. The affirmation of the\ncausal efficacy of finite spirits or minds like us raises questions\nabout consistency, since the \u201cconservation is but continuous\ncreation\u201d principle, which seems to be doing the work in\nBerkeley\u2019s occasionalist claims in De Motu, is\ntypically thought to be applicable universally, without discriminating\nbetween minds and bodies.\n [11]\n",
