    "main_text": "First Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: One Historically Associated with a Non-Feminist Environmental Philosophy || Radical Environmental Philosophy: Feminist Philosophical Perspectives on Deep Ecology\n2.4 Radical Environmental Philosophy: Feminist Philosophical Perspectives on Deep Ecology\n\nA \u201cradical\u201d environmental philosophy challenges\nfoundational assumptions and claims of canonical philosophy in the\ncontext of environmental issues. These challenges are\n\u201cradical\u201d in the etymological sense that they \u201cgo to\nthe roots\u201d of environmental problems\u2014typically, the\nconceptual roots\u2014and in the historical sense that they had never\nbefore been part of a moral theory. (This description permits that\nwhat was \u201cradical\u201d at one time may no longer be radical.)\nOne of the most influential radical positions is \u201cdeep\necology\u201d. \n\n\nNorwegian philosopher Arne Naess coined the term \u201cdeep\necology\u201d to refer to the (deep) conceptual roots of the\nenvironmental crisis (Naess 1973). Naess contrasted deep ecology with\n\u201cshallow ecology\u201d. Both are concerned, for example, with\nresolving such \u201capplied\u201d environmental problems as air and\nwater pollution, use of natural resources, human overconsumption and\noverpopulation. But, according to Naess, only deep ecology provides an\nunderstanding of these issues in terms of false or problematic\nunderlying assumptions, concepts, beliefs and values of canonical\nphilosophy.\n\n\nHistorically, the emergence of ecofeminist philosophy was intimately\nlinked to deep ecology.  However, during the 1980s and 1990s, that\nlink was contested; the so-called \u201cdeep ecology-ecofeminism\ndebate\u201d that emerged took centerstage in discussions of environmental\nphilosophy (see Jim Cheney 1987; Cuomo 1994; Kheel 1990; Plumwood\n1993; Salleh 1984; Warren 1999).\nThe ecofeminism-deep ecology debate focused on two features of\nspecial significance to ecofeminist philosophy. The first is deep\necology's criticism of canonical Western philosophy for its\nanthropocentric (human-centered) thinking about human-nature\nrelationships. The second is the notion of the self that is described\nby deep ecology's basic \u201cprinciple of\nself-realization\u201d. Both features are critiqued by Val Plumwood,\none of the pioneers of ecofeminist philosophy (Plumwood 1993). Her\ncritique is summarized here since it provides insight into some basic\nclaims of ecofeminist philosophy\n(Section 3).  \nAccording to deep ecology, canonical Western philosophy's\nunacceptable anthropocentrism is rooted in several\nproblematic value dualisms, including\nthe \u201cculture versus nature\u201d dualism. Plumwood argues that\ndeep ecology's criticism of anthropocentrism fails to see that\ncanonical philosophy's anthropocentrism has functioned\nhistorically as andropocentrism (male-centered thinking). She\nclaims that its failure to see this leads deep ecologists to make two\nfalse assumptions\u2014that one can disentangle anthropocentrism and\nandropocentrism as distinct and separate ways of thinking, and that\none can critique the \u201cculture versus nature\u201d dualism\nwithout providing a gendered analysis of how this dualism has\nfunctioned historically to \u201cjustify\u201d the dominations of\nwomen and nature. (This criticism of the \u201cculture versus\nnature\u201d dualism is discussed\nthroughout Section 3.)\nThe second problematic feature of deep ecology concerns the\nprinciple of self-realization, which claims that the\nhuman self (small \u2018s\u2019) is actualized only when it\nbecomes merged with the cosmos, a Self (capital\n\u2018S\u2019). Plumwood argues that this principle is false because\nit keeps intact \u201cthe discontinuity thesis\u201d\u2014the\nthesis that there is a clear ontological divide between humans (or the\nsphere of culture) and nature. Culture and nature are\n\u201cdiscontinuous\u201d because humans are separate from and different\nin kind from nature. For Plumwood, the discontinuity thesis is false\nand any environmental philosophy that assumes it is conceptually\nflawed. Plumwood argues that since deep ecology assumes, rather than\ndenies (as deep ecologists claim), the discontinuity thesis, deep\necology is a conceptually flawed environmental philosophy.\nHow does deep ecology do this\u2014presuppose a thesis that it\nsets out to deny? Plumwood's answer is that the discontinuity thesis\nis kept intact by deep ecology's commitment to three faulty\nconceptions of the self. She calls them \u201cthe Indistinguishable\nSelf\u201d, \u201cthe Expanded Self\u201d, and \u201cthe\nTranscendent Self\u201d (Plumwood 1993).\nThe \u201cIndistinguishable Self\u201d rejects any and all\nboundaries between humans and nature; humans are just one strand in a\ngreater biotic web. This conception of the self presumes what Plumwood\ncalls an \u201cidentity thesis:\u201d the human self is an\necological self. The problem with the identity thesis is that it\nmistakenly solves the discontinuity problem by\nobliterating all divisions between humans and nature. For just\nthis reason, Plumwood rejects the identity thesis and the notion of\nthe Indistinguishable Self. If the principle of self-realization is\nabout the Indistinguishable Self, the principle is false. In contrast,\nPlumwood defends a conception of the self that makes\nhumans both continuous with and distinct from nature, both\nindividual selves (who are different from nature) and ecological\nselves (who are a part of nature).\nThe \u201cExpanded Self\u201d distinguishes between the\nparticular, individual human self and an expanded, greater\n\u201ccosmic\u201d Self. Plumwood claims that whatever is\nmeant by a \u201ccosmic Self\u201d (it isn't clear), the Expanded\nSelf denies the importance of individuals as\nindividuals\u2014as distinct human beings who have their own\nparticular attachments and are in various dependency relationships\n(such as parent and child, care giver and the cared for) that are\nunique to each self. Plumwood argues that, given that most of the\nworld's women lack many of the human rights, civil liberties, and\neducational opportunities that men have (as individual selves), it is\nfar too early to abandon a notion of the human self as an individual\n(a self) in favor of some nebulous, undifferentiated,\nexpanded, \u201ccosmic\u201d Self. If the principle of\nself-realization is about the Expanded Self, the principle is\nfalse.\nThe \u201cTranscendent Self\u201d refers to the individual self\nwho overcomes its particularity to become a more self-aware,\ntransformed self. Plumwood claims that the Transcendent Self\npresupposes a \u201ctriumph-over thesis\u201d\u2014the Transcendent\nSelf triumphs over highly particularistic attachments, emotions,\nwants, and desires that individual selves have toward themselves and\neach other. The Transcendent Self falsely rejects a view of selves\nthat Plumwood defends: human selves are emotionally interdependent,\necological, relational beings whose actualization requires a rejection\nof rationalism (the identification of humans with reason or\nrationality) and mind-body dualism. Plumwood's conception of the self\nis not a rejection of particularity and individuality; it is\na recognition that individual selves are also interdependent\nbeings-in-relationships, not Transcendent Selves who triumph over such\ninterdependencies and relationships. If the principle of\nself-realization is about the Transcendent Self, the principle is\nfalse.\n",
