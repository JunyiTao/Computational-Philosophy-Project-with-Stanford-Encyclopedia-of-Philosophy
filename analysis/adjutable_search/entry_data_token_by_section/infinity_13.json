Paradoxes and puzzles involving infinity\n\nThe latter part of this entry will explore selected applications of\nmathematical concepts of infinity in theories of probability,\ndecision, and spacetime, and some associated paradoxes. Before we turn\nto those theories, we warm up with some paradoxes and puzzles that\nlink mathematics, metaphysical possibility, and physical possibility.\nThere are many different paradoxes and puzzles that we might have\nincluded in this section. We consider a small sample of paradoxes and\npuzzles that some\u2014e.g. Pruss (2018a)\u2014have thought might\nmotivate a return to Aristotle\u2019s views on the impossibility of\nactual infinites.\n\nIn the\n\nSupplement on al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s objection,\n\nwe discuss a puzzle due to al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b that is of historical\ninterest. For more see, for example, Rucker (1982), Moore (1990/2019),\nOppy (2006), and Huemer (2016).\n",
