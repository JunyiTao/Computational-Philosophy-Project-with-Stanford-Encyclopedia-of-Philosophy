    "main_text": "Varieties of Fundamentality || Primitivism\n1.4 Primitivism\n\nAccording to primitivism about the fundamental, we cannot define\nfundamentality. But we may be able to characterize it, and it is to be\nexpected that\n (RI)\n and\n (CMB)\n are likely candidates in this regard. This type of view may be what\nFine (2001: 26) gestures towards, when he remarks that it is the\nworld\u2019s intrinsic structure that is fundamental. One way to\ndevelop the idea is by defining absolute fundamentality in terms of\nrelative fundamentality and introducing a primitive notion of\n\u201cReality\u201d as it is in itself (Fine 2001; see also Fine\n2009). Note however that Fine proposes this notion in connection to\nthe debate between realism and anti-realism, whereby\n\u201cReality\u201d may be understood as objectivity. So, it is not\nentirely clear that we can understand fundamentality in terms of this\nnotion.\n\nMore generally, we may think that the absolute notion of fundamental\nreality is not in need of a relational underpinning (Fine\n2001; Wilson 2014: 561). This is in contrast to the various\ncomparative or relational notions of dependence that we have been\ndiscussing (see also Fine 2015). Note that primitivism must also be\ncontrasted with\n (CMB)\n insofar as it is understood as a definition of fundamentality, even\nthough it is not uncommon to see primitivist characterizations of\nfundamentality that resemble (CMB). For instance, a primitivist who\naccepts Fine\u2019s notion of \u201cReality\u201d would like to\ndistinguish between what is Real in itself and what may be true (i.e.,\nobjective) even if it does not concern the way that things are\nfundamentally. As Fine puts it,\n\n\neven though two nations may be at war, we may deny that this is how\nthings really or fundamentally are because the entities in question,\nthe nations, and the relationship between them, are no part of Reality\nas it [is] in itself. (Fine 2001: 26)\n\n\nThe idea behind the primitivist view is actually very simple and it\nmay be prudent to try to capture it without the controversial notion\nof \u201cReality\u201d. One way to do so would be to understand the\nentities in the fundamental base to be basic in the sense that they\nplay a role analogous to axioms in a theory, or that the fundamental\nentities are all that God had to bring about to make the world (Wilson\n2014: 560; 2016; see also Dorr 2005). We can find several occurrences\nof this type of heuristic in the literature on fundamentality,\ne.g.,\n\n\nThe primary is (as it were) all God would need to create. (Schaffer\n2009: 351)\n\nall God had to do when making the world was fix the qualitative facts;\n(Dasgupta 2014b: 14)\n\nWe often explain the notion of fundamental reality in intuitive terms\nby saying that all God had to do in order to create the world was fix\nthe fundamental facts. (Glazier 2016: 35)\n\n\nTo drive the idea home, consider the following passage from\nKripke:\n\n\nSuppose we imagine God creating the world; what does He need to do to\nmake the identity of heat and molecular motion obtain? Here it would\nseem that all He needs to do is to create the heat, that is, the\nmolecular motion itself. If the air molecules on this earth are\nsufficiently agitated, if there is a burning fire, then the earth will\nbe hot even if there are no observers to see it. God created light\n(and thus created streams of photons, according to present scientific\ndoctrine) before He created human and animal observers; and the same\npresumably holds for heat. How then does it appear to us that the\nidentity of molecular motion with heat is a substantive scientific\nfact, that the mere creation of molecular motion still leaves God with\nthe additional task of making molecular motion into heat? This feeling\nis indeed illusory, but what is a substantive task for the\nDeity is the task of making molecular motion felt as heat. To do this\nHe must create some sentient beings to insure that the molecular\nmotion produces the sensation S in them. Only after he has\ndone this will there be beings who can learn that the sentence\n\u201cHeat is the motion of molecules\u201d expresses an a\nposteriori truth in precisely the same way that we do. (Kripke\n1980: 153)\n\n\nNow, Kripke is of course not trying to put forward an account of\nfundamentality here, but rather to specify that the qualitative\nexperience of feeling heat is something additional to molecular\nmotion. The idea, however, is strikingly close to the primitivist\naccount of fundamentality, whereby the important thing is to find a\nsufficiently rich basis for everything in the world\u2014this is of\ncourse reminiscent of\n (CMB),\n but here the heuristic is simply used to characterize fundamentality,\nnot to define it.\n\nSince the primitivist thinks that we cannot define fundamentality, one\nmight wonder how it is that she can decide on what the fundamental\nentities are. In other words, what is our epistemic access to issues\nconcerning fundamentality? A possible answer is that we proceed the\nsame way as we do with other primitives in metaphysics. That is, by\nasking how the view that x is fundamental fits in our overall\ntheory. How does it fare with regard to our other commitments? These\nare issues where theoretical virtues such as simplicity and\nexplanatory power might be employed (for a related discussion, see\nSchaffer 2014). However, this is not the place to tackle the\nadmittedly difficult epistemic questions surrounding metaphysical\ntheories in general, or the criteria that are to be employed in\ntheory-choice. The primitivist about fundamentality may have one more\nprimitive in their overall theory, and this, of course, calls for\njustification. But conceiving of the fundamental as primitive is no\nmore mysterious than conceiving of, say, naturalness or grounding as\nprimitive. This is not to say that postulating naturalness or\ngrounding as primitives wouldn\u2019t also require some justification\nthough.\n\nThe primitivist about fundamentality does, however, face some\nchallenges that are specific to fundamentality. Some of these\nchallenges have been raised by Schaffer (2016a), targeting\nWilson\u2019s proposal. A potentially helpful clarification from\nSchaffer is the following: there is something primitive in each of the\ntheories on offer, but the primitivist about fundamentality takes\nbeing-absolutely-fundamental as that primitive, whereas at\nleast certain proponents of the relative independence\n (RI)\n view (such as Schaffer himself and, e.g., Rosen 2010) take the\n\u201clinking notion\u201d of grounding,\nbeing-relatively-more-fundamental-than-and-linked-to, as the\nprimitive (Schaffer 2016a: 157). As Schaffer notes, one may also take\nboth to be primitive, as Fine perhaps does. Schaffer argues that while\nabsolute fundamentality can be quite easily defined in terms of\ngrounding, as we\u2019ve seen with (RI), it may not be so easy to\ndefine grounding in terms of absolute fundamentality. As observed\nearlier, there have also been recent attempts to define grounding in\nterms of relative fundamentality (Correia 2018), as well as attempts\nto define notions of relative fundamentality in terms of grounding\n(Correia 2021b, 2021c; Werner 2021), but none of these options are\ndirectly available to the primitivist.\n\nA further issue arises if there is no fundamental level at all. In\nthis scenario, the primitivist has no way to account for relative\nfundamentality, and hence one of the two key tasks for fundamentality\nwould be lost. In contrast, the friend of\n (RI)\n could still construct a priority ordering using her favorite notion\nof dependence, since no absolutely fundamental level is needed to get\nthe ordering started (Schaffer 2016a,\n 158).[18]\n How can the primitivist reply?\n\nOne possibility is to try fixing the direction of priority even in the\nabsence of an absolutely fundamental level (Wilson 2016: 196ff.).\nDrawing on a suggestion from Montero (2006: 179), Wilson proposes that\nanalogously to an infinite sequence of numbers such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4\n\u2026 being still \u201cbounded below\u201d by zero, there could\nbe an infinite descent of fundamental entities that approaches a limit\nwhereby the limit acts as the fundamental level even though it is\nnever reached. Related ideas may be found elsewhere in the literature\n(Tahko 2014; Morganti 2015; Raven 2016). One difficulty with this\nproposal is that applying the notion of a limit assumes that we can\nassign a numerical measure to the descending entities that approach\nthis limit. So, we would need to be able to construct the hierarchical\nstructure of relative fundamentality in such a way that this numerical\nmeasure applies to it. Moreover, even if approaching a limit does not\nnecessarily need to be constructed numerically, the notion of a limit\nitself requires postulating the (fundamental) limit, in this case\nzero. While zero is not part of the sequence, it does seem to be part\nof the ontology.\n\nAnother possible strategy to address this challenge to primitivism is\nto argue that fixing the fundamental is not (always) enough to fix the\npriority ordering. Rather, we should pay close attention to the\nvarious dependence relations that interest us, such as the parthood\nrelation, and assess the nature of the non-fundamental entities that\nthese relations relate. Importantly, we might get different answers\ndepending on which view about these natures is correct (see Wilson\n2016: 200ff.).\n\nThis concludes our discussion of the different ways to understand\nabsolute fundamentality. We will now move on to discuss a variety of\nimportant views that are often expressed in terms of fundamentality,\nputting the notion into use.\n",
