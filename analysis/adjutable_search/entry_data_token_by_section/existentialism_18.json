    "main_text": "Ethics || The Ethics of Recognition\n6.2 The Ethics of Recognition\n\n\nThere is also heterodox current among some religious\nexistentialists, one that suggests that moral demands are placed on us\nwhen we recognize ourselves not as voluntaristic subjects\u2014or, in\nthe words of Iris Murdoch, \u201cbrave naked wills\u201d (1983, 46)\nsevered from bonds of community and attachment\u2014but as relational\nbeings who are fundamentally bound together in mutual vulnerability.\nAnd this recognition may serve as the foundation for an ethics by\npulling us out of our everyday self-absorption and awakening us, not to\nour freedom, but to our essential dependency.\n\n\nSpeaking through the religious elder Father Zossima in The\nBrothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky offers a powerful indictment of\nthe \u201cterrible individualism\u201d that he sees as endemic to\nmodernity, where unfettered freedom and self-affirmation have become\nthe highest values. Such a view leads not to self-actualization but to\nloneliness and despair. The modern man, says Zossima, \u201cis\naccustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the\nwhole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in\nmen and in humanity [\u2026] but this terrible individualism must\ninevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how\nunnaturally they are separated from one another\u201d (1879 [1957\u201380,\n279]). Against the vision of the willful subject who makes choices\nwithout evaluative limits or constraints, Dostoevsky suggests it is\nonly in recognizing the Other as dependent and vulnerable that we can\ncome to recognize ourselves. True freedom emerges when we release\nourselves from the bondage of our own egoistic striving and adopt an\nattitude of humility and self-sacrifice. The aim is to show that the\nhuman being is not an isolated will but a frail and defenseless being\nthat is dependent on the self-less love, compassion, and charity of\nothers.[13]\nWhen we free ourselves from the temptations of individualism in this\nway, Zossima says a moral demand is placed on us, one where we begin\nto see that \u201cwe are all responsible to all and for all\u201d\n(1879\u201380 [1957, 228). \n\nThe Jewish existentialist Martin Buber expands on this idea in his\nmasterwork I and Thou. He claims that in our everyday lives we\ngenerally relate to others from an instrumental and objectifying\nstandpoint, what he calls the \u201cI-It\u201d (Ich-Es)\nrelation, where the other is encountered as a thing (or\n\u201cit\u201d) to be manipulated and controlled for one\u2019s own\nuse. This relation is comforting because it creates the illusion that\nwe have control of our situation. But there are moments in our lives\nwhen this illusion collapses, and we become vulnerable to the other,\nnot as an \u201cit\u201d but as a \u201cyou.\u201d In the\n\u201cI-You\u201d (Ich-Du) relation, all the egoistic\ndefenses we rely on to conceal our essential dependency and openness to\nthe Other break down. Buber refers to this as an experience of grace,\nwhere the Other is revealed to me as a whole person, defenseless and\nexposed, and I am revealed in the same way. It is a moment where\n\u201ctwo human beings reveal the You to one another\u201d (1923\n[1970, 95]). In this way, anxiety isn\u2019t a radically\nindividualizing affair, where the forlorn subject is cut off from the\nrelational world to confront their own freedom. For Buber, exposure to\nthe I-You relation shakes us out of our own egoistic concerns and\nawakens us to the fact that we are not isolated individuals but beings\nwho are always in living relation with others. With this experience\n\u201cthe barriers of the individual are breached,\u201d and this\ncreates an affective union, a \u201cbridge from self-being to\nself-being across the abyss of dread\u201d (1938 [1965], 201,\n207]).\n",
