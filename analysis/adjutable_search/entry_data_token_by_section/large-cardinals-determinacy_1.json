    "main_text": "Philosophical Motivation || Interpretability Hierarchy\n1.1  Interpretability Hierarchy\n\nSuppose T1 and T2 are\nrecursively enumerable axiom systems. We say that T1\nis interpretable in T2\n(T1 \u2264 T2) when, roughly\nspeaking, there is a translation \u03c4 from the language\nof T1 to the language of T2 such\nthat, for each sentence \u03d5 of the language\nof T1, if T1 \u22a2 \u03d5\nthen T2 \u22a2 \u03c4(\u03d5). We shall\nwrite T1 < T2\nwhen T1 \u2264 T2\nand T2 \u2270 T1 and we shall\nwrite T1 \u2261 T2 when\nboth T1 \u2264 T2\nand T2 \u2264 T1. In the latter\ncase, T1 and T2 are said to\nbe mutually interpretable. The equivalence class of all\ntheories mutually interpretable with T is called\nthe interpretability degree\nof T. The interpretability hierarchy is the\ncollection of all theories ordered under the relation \u2264. \n\n There is a useful characterization of the relation \u2264 that\napplies when it is restricted to the type of theories that we will be\nconsidering. To describe this we need a few more notions. A\ntheory T is reflexive provided it proves the\nconsistency of each of its finite fragments, it\nis \u03a301-complete\nprovided it proves each\ntrue \u03a301-statement,\nand it\nis \u03a301-sound\nprovided it does not prove a\nfalse \u03a301-statement. Let\n\u2018T1\n\u2286\u03a001 T2\u2019\nbe shorthand for the statement that\nall \u03a001-sentences\nprovable in T1 are provable\nin T2. The following characterization of\ninterpretability is central to the theory of interpretability:\nIf T1 is reflexive\nand \u03a301-complete,\nthen \nT1 \u2264 T2\niff T1\n\u2286\u03a001 T2.\n\n This result is due to Orey and H\u00e1jek (for further details\nsee Theorem 6 on p. 103 of Lindstr\u00f6m (2003) and Fact 3.2 of\nVisser (1998)). It follows from this result and the second\nincompleteness theorem that for any theory T meeting these two\nconditions, the theory T + Con(T) is strictly stronger\nthan T, that is, T < T +\nCon(T). Moreover, it follows from the arithmetized completeness\ntheorem that the T + \u00acCon(T) is interpretable\nin T, hence, T \u2261 T + \u00acCon(T)\n(see Feferman 1960). \n\n It turns out that the interpretability order is exceedingly\ncomplex. For example, through the uses of metamathematical coding\ntechniques, one can show that for any two\ntheories T1 and T2 such\nthat T1 < T2 there is a third\ntheory T such that T1 < T\n< T2. And for any theory T, one can show\nthat there are theories T1 and T2\nsuch that T1 > T and T2\n> T and yet neither T1\n\u2264 T2 nor T2\n\u2264 T1 (that is, T1\nand T2 are above T and are incomparable in\nthe interpretability order). Thus, the order on the degrees of\ninterpretability is neither well-founded nor linearly ordered. \n\n Nevertheless, when one restricts to theories that \u201carise in\nnature\u201d (that is, the kind of formal systems that one encounters\nin a mathematical text as opposed to examples of the type above, which\nare metamathematically manufactured by logicians to have the deviant\nproperties in question) the interpretability ordering is quite simple:\nThere are no descending chains and there are no incomparable\nelements. In other words, it is a well-ordering. This is quite\nremarkable: If one takes any two \u201cnatural\ntheories\u201d\u2014even from completely different domains, say one\nfrom analysis and another from combinatorics\u2014then generally it\nturns out that one is interpretable in the other and that the two line\nup along a well-founded path through the interpretability\nhierarchy. \n\n This well founded path through the interpretability hierarchy has\na canonical sequence through it which enables one to climb the\nhierarchy in a principled manner. At the base one has the very weak\ntheory Q and one climbs upward by adding \u201cclosure\nprinciples\u201d. This starts with principles asserting that certain\nfast-growing functions\u2014exponentiation, super-exponentiation,\netc.\u2014are total and it proceeds upward through set existence\nprinciples, passing through the layers of second-order arithmetic, the\nsubsystems of set theory, and the hierarchy of large cardinal\naxioms. \n\n Of particular interest with regard to the question of pluralism\nare those points along the well-founded sequence that correspond to\ncertain limitative conceptions of the nature of mathematics, such as\nthe degree marked by Q (Robinson Arithmetic,\nwhich corresponds to strict finitism\nin the sense articulated by Nelson), the degree marked by PRA (Primitive Recursive Arithmetic, which\ncorresponds to finitism in the sense articulated by Tait),\nand the degree marked by ATR0 (Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion, which corresponds\nto predicativism in the sense articulated by Feferman). In\neach case, one draws the line at a certain point in the hierarchy,\nmaintaining non-pluralism below and pluralism above. \nFurther Reading: For a more detailed account of the\ninterpretability hierarchy see the entry \n \u201cIndependence and Large Cardinals\u201d. \n For even further detail see Lindstr\u00f6m (2003) and Visser\n(1998). \n",
