The Rules: Simple Natures and the Concepts of Clarity and Distinctness\n\nIt is in the Rules that Descartes introduces the simple\nnatures. The simple natures are not only what our ideas are\nof\u2014that is, they not only constitute the contents of\nour ideas, the \u201cobjects\u201d immediately presented to the\nmind\u2014but are also the natures possessed by things. (AT X 399;\nCSM I 32) Examples of simple natures are colors, sounds, smells,\nshapes, sizes, extension, and the like. He says, for example, in Rule\nTwelve, \u201cif I judge that a certain shape is not moving, I shall\nsay that my thought is in some way composed of shape and rest; and\nsimilarly in other cases.\u201d (AT X 420; CSM I 45) In the First\nMeditation, Descartes mentions similar ideational elements \u201cfrom\nwhich all the images of things\u201d are formed. (AT VII 20; CSM II\n13\u201314) In the Second Meditation, in his analysis of the adventitious\nidea of a piece of wax, Descartes again provides a list of such\nideational elements. (AT VII 30\u201332; CSM II 20\u201321) In the Third\nMeditation, he refers to such items as \u201celements in my\nideas.\u201d (AT VII 44; CSM II 30) And, in the Sixth Meditation,\nwhen revisiting some of what he had established in the Second\nMeditation, talk of these qualities that are \u201cthe only immediate\nobjects of my sensory awareness\u201d is again introduced. (AT VII\n75ff; CSM II 52ff) So, although Descartes does not employ the\n\u201csimple natures\u201d terminology in later work, the\nphilosophical notion certainly looks to be present in his later work.\n\n\nSimple natures form an ordered, hierarchical system. Upon analysis\nthey appear to be sorted into two basic groups or classes, which not\nsurprisingly corresponds to Descartes\u2019 mind-body dualism. (AT X\n399; CSM I 32) Descartes refers to this partition of simple natures as\nthe enumeration. The basic classes of this enumeration will\nalso be partitioned. In light of this, this ultimate\nenumeration\u2014the partition of the simple natures into the classes\nof thinking and extended things\u2014can be referred to as the\nmaster enumeration. As laid out in the Rules, the\nhierarchy is not understood in terms of the ontology, but in terms of\nwhat must be known in terms of what. (AT X 381; CSM I 21) These groups\nor classes are formed in light of epistemic priority. One group\nincludes those simple natures that presuppose the simple nature\nthought or thinking, while the other group includes\nthose simple natures that presuppose the simple nature\nextension. The view is that the simple nature shape,\nfor instance, presupposes the simple nature extension in that\nthe former is known (understood) on the basis of the latter. As\nDescartes puts it later in the Principles, \u201cshape is\nunintelligible except in an extended thing.\u201d (AT VIIIA 25; CSM I\n210) No extension, no shape. The same holds for the other class. The\nsimple nature hot, a sensible quality, presupposes the simple\nnature thought or thinking in that the former is\nknown (or understood) on the basis of the latter. No thought or\nthinking, no (feeling of) hotness. \n\nDescartes recognizes two forms of conjunction found among the\nsimple natures: necessary and contingent conjunction. (AT X 421f; CSM\nI 45f) Two simple natures are said to be necessarily conjoined\nwhenever one presupposes (entails) the other. (Ibid.) So, for\ninstance, the simple nature shape is necessarily conjoined\nwith the simple nature extension insofar as the former\npresupposes (or entails) the latter. An idea is said to be\nclear whenever the necessary conjunction between simple\nnatures in the idea is exhibited or made explicit. Descartes\u2019\nprocedure for making an idea \u201cclearer\u201d is to compare the\nsimple natures in the idea. He writes that the procedure: \n\n\u2026is carried over from one subject to another solely by means of\ncomparison, which enables us to state that the thing we are seeking is\nin this or that respect similar to, or identical with, or equal to,\nsome given thing. Accordingly, in all reasoning it is only by means of\ncomparison that we attain an exact knowledge of the truth. (AT X 439;\nCSM I 57)\n\n\nHe goes on to say that \u201cUnity is the common nature which, we\nsaid above, all things which we are comparing must participate in\nequally.\u201d (AT X 449; CSM I 63 See also AT X 440f; CSM I 57f) The\nsimple natures shape and size share in common their\npresupposing the simple nature extension. Extension is the\ncommon nature; it unites such natures into a single thing (a\nbody). Thought or thinking is the common nature that unites the other\nsimple natures into a single thing (a mind). An idea is said\nto be obscure, then, whenever no necessary conjunction (the\n\u201cpresupposes\u201d relation) is exhibited or made explicit in\nan idea.\n\nIdeas are said to be confused whenever they include or\ncontain simple natures belonging to the two mutually exclusive classes\nof simple nature (the two classes together forming the enumeration).\nHere, the Latin confusio means mixed together. The\nadventitious idea of the Sun is an example of a confused idea. In\npresenting the Sun as circular-shaped and hot, the idea includes\nsimple natures that belong to the two mutually exclusive classes.\nShape belongs to the class whose members presuppose the\nsimple nature extension, whereas heat (a quality)\nbelongs to the class whose members presupposes the simple nature\nthought or thinking. An idea is said to be\ndistinct, then, whenever it includes or contains only simple\nnatures belonging to one of the mutually exclusive classes. The\nastronomical idea of the Sun, as introduced in the Third Meditation,\nlooks to be an example of a distinct idea. It includes only those\nsimple natures belonging to the class whose members presuppose the\nsimple nature extension. (Smith 2010, 2015)\n\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes introduces what scholars refer to\nas \u201cthe truth rule\u201d: Whatever one perceives clearly and\ndistinctly is true. (AT VII 35; CSM II 24) In the Fifth Meditation, in\nhis analysis of the clear and distinct idea of a triangle, Descartes\nargues that since \u201cwhatever is true is something (i.e.,\nreal)\u201d (AT VII 65; CSM II 45), it follows that\n\u201ceverything which I clearly and distinctly perceive to belong to\nthat thing (the triangle) really does belong to it\u2026\u201d (AT\nVII 65; CSM II 45) As others have argued (Wahl 1995, Lennon 2007,\nSmith 2010a, Smith 2015), for Descartes, to say that something was\n\u201creal\u201d was in part to say that it existed independently of\na finite mind. This is the import of Descartes\u2019 proving the\nexistence of God and body. They are real things. In his analysis of\nthe idea of the triangle, Descartes concludes that the natures that he\nclearly and distinctly perceives the triangle as possessing are in\nfact possessed by the triangle. These natures are\nreal. \n\nRussell Wahl has argued that for Descartes truth was related\ndirectly to natures. (Wahl 1995) What is true, he says,\n\u201cis the object before the mind and not the idea\u2014not the\noperation of the mind, but what is perceived.\u201d (Wahl 1995, p.\n188) In other words, truth is not related to the idea taken\nmaterially, but to the idea taken objectively. This, he says, is no\ndoubt related to Descartes\u2019 claim that whatever is true is\nsomething (real). (AT VII 65; CSM II 45) The import of this view is\nthat the simple natures, which constitute the contents of ideas, are\nalso the very same natures possessed by things\u2014at least when the\nidea is clear and distinct. Here, the simple natures look to be\nserving as an ontological bridge, so to speak, between the mind and\nextra-mental reality. Wahl\u2019s reading is controversial, but worth\nnoting, since the potentiality lurks in its being able to bring closer\ntogether the Representationalist and Direct Realist readings.\n\nA relatively recent suggestion, which emerged in part as a response to\nthe conflict between the Representationalist and Direct Realist\ninterpretations, comes from Paul Hoffman. (Hoffman 2002) He bases his\nsuggestion on a view held by Aquinas. Given that simple natures are\nthe ontological elements of ideas and things, Hoffman in essence\nargues that it is the simple natures themselves that possess the two\nkinds of reality that Descartes had introduced in the Third\nMeditation, namely, formal and objective reality. (Hoffman 2002)\nConsider the adventitious idea of the Sun. As noted earlier, this idea\nis obscure and confused. Even so, it reportedly represents the Sun in\nthe heavens. Descartes makes clear in the Third Meditation that the\nastronomical idea of the Sun better \u201cresembles\u201d the object\nreportedly in the heavens than does the adventitious idea. One way\nthis may be the case is that the astronomical idea is clear and\ndistinct in that it includes only those simple natures that presuppose\nextension, such as shape, size,\nmotion, and so on (distinct), and it exhibits the\npresupposition relation (clear). The Sun is a body whose nature is\nextension (in length, breadth, and depth). \n\n\u201cThe sun as it exists objectively,\u201d says Hoffman,\n\u201cis able to represent the sun as it exists formally in the\nheavens precisely because it is the same thing that has these two\nmodes of existence.\u201d (Hoffman 2002, p. 168) That is, the Sun\npossesses both formal and objective reality, or rather, the simple\nnatures that constitute the thing referred by the words \u201cthe\nSun\u201d possess both formal and objective reality. Hoffman\u2019s\nsuggestion is that it is the objective reality possessed by\nthe simple natures that the mind \u201cengages\u201d when perceiving\nthe Sun. It is via the Sun\u2019s objective being that the mind has\n\u201caccess to\u201d the Sun in the heavens. This suggestion would\nseem to straddle both the Representationalist and Direct Realist\ninterpretations, though, as Hoffman himself characterizes his view,\nhis suggestion leans in the direction of the Direct Realist\ninterpretation. \n\nThat said, there is trouble lurking in Hoffman\u2019s suggestion.\nDescartes very clearly says that ideas are the items in his\nontology that possess objective reality, and they possess it by their\nvery nature. (AT VII 42; CSM II 29) If the Sun, for instance, or any\nof the simple natures that constitute the Sun, are the items that\npossess objective reality, then the Sun or the simple natures that\nconstitute it are ideas. But the Sun, or the simple natures\nthat constitute it, also presumably possess formal reality, which is\nthe kind of reality a thing possesses insofar as it is a real or\nactual thing. If by \u201creal\u201d Descartes in part means\nexists independently of a finite mind, as Wahl and Lennon\ncontend, then the Sun, or the simple natures that constitute it,\ninsofar as they possess formal reality, exist independently of the\nfinite mind. This would entail that ideas can and do exist\nindependently of the finite mind. But this runs counter to\nDescartes\u2019 ontology. For further examination of the\nRepresentationalist and Direct Realist interpretations, which includes\na critical look at Hoffman\u2019s suggestion, see (Smith 2010a). \n",
