    "main_text": "Soteriology || Re-Generation in Life\n6.3 Re-Generation in Life\n\nShangqing (Highest Clarity) scriptures are the first ones to describe\nmeditation methods for the creation of an immortal body, or an\nimmortal self, through the generation of a new inner embryo. An\naccount of \u201crefining the bodily form in Great Darkness\u201d,\nfound in a Shangqing source, adds an important detail to what we have\nseen above, saying that the adept receives his second birth by going\nagain through his embryonic development (Robinet 1979: 63\u201366;\nStrickmann 1979: 182\u201383; Pregadio 2004: 124\u201325). Another\nexample is the practice of \u201cuntying the knots\u201d\n(jiejie). In the Shangqing view, human gestation accounts for\nthe creation of \u201cknots\u201d and \u201cnodes\u201d that serve\nto support the five viscera, but are ultimately responsible for\none\u2019s death. To untie them, the adept is instructed to create a\nnew embryo through a complex meditation practice (Robinet 1993:\n139\u201343; on the \u201cchange of destiny\u201d involved in this\npractice see Bokenkamp 2005b, 160\u201362).\n\nShangqing texts also describe meditation practices performed in order\nto save one\u2019s ancestors confined in the netherworld, who are\ntransformed into immortals by first returning to the embryonic state\n(Lagerwey 1981: 206\u20138; Robinet 1984: 1:170\u201373). Lingbao\nsources describe ritual practices performed for the same purpose\n(Bokenkamp 1989: 7\u201314). Several centuries later, these practices\nwould evolve in two main ways. The first is the method of Salvation\nthrough Refinement (liandu), in which a priest descends\ninto the hells to release the souls of the deceased and lead them to\nthe realm of Jade Clarity. Combining ritual and meditation, the entire\npractice takes place within the officiant: the celestial and infernal\nregions correspond to loci found within his own person, and the\ndeities involved in the practice are enabled to perform their salvific\nwork through his own body (Lagerwey 1987: 232\u201335; Boltz 1983).\nThe second development is Neidan, or Internal Alchemy, whose\npractice is often described as the conception, gestation, and delivery\nof an immortal embryo (see\n \u00a710.3).\n",
