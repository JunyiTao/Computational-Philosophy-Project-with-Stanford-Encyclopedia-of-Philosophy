    "main_text": "Distribution According to Need || Minimising Neediness\n5.3 Minimising Neediness\n\n\nIn complete contrast, distribution according to need could be\ninterpreted to mean minimising unmet need, in other words satisfying\nneed claims to the greatest possible extent overall. This, however,\nseems more like a principle of efficiency than a principle of\njustice. As such, it is vulnerable to the objection that it\ndoesn\u2019t take seriously the separateness of persons. It is likely\nto require consistently favouring those who are best at converting\nresources into need-satisfaction, and conversely it may recommend\ndoing nothing for people who have large need claims but whose\nsituation is such that it can only materially be improved by deploying\na lot of resources. Once again this seems intuitively unfair.\n",
