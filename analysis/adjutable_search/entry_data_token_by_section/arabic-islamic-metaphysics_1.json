    "main_text": "The Arabic Translations of the Metaphysics\n2. The Arabic Translations of the Metaphysics\n\nThe translation activity regarding the Metaphysics continued\nuninterruptedly for three centuries (the ninth to the eleventh), with\nthe production of several Arabic versions of Aristotle\u2019s text,\nsome of which might have depended on Syriac intermediaries, and the\ninvolvement of a number of different translators, belonging to the\nmain schools of Arabic philosophy. These translations display\ndifferent degrees of inclusiveness (from integral versions of\nAristotle\u2019s work to translations of its single books) and\nliteralness (from strict word for word procedures to styles more akin\nto paraphrase). Cumulatively, the Arabic translations of the\nMetaphysics evidence the intention of making the entire text\nof Aristotle\u2019s work accessible to Arabic readers, extending the\ntranslation activity from the main bulk of the work towards more\nperipheral books, like Alpha Meizon (I) and Nu (XIV). Equally clear is\nthe effort to provide an Arabic version increasingly faithful to the\nGreek original and more respondent to philosophical clarity, and a\nspecial focus on the repeatedly translated book Lambda (XII). Also\nremarkable is the inclusion in the translation activity of the main\navailable Greek commentaries on the Metaphysics, namely those\nof Alexander of Aphrodisias and Themistius (less certain is the case\nof Syrianus\u2019 commentary), whose explanations of book Lambda\n(and, in the case of Syrianus, Beta (III)) were translated together\nwith the corresponding books of Aristotle\u2019s work. Since other\nGreek works intimately related to Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics were also translated into Arabic\u2014like\nTheophrastus\u2019s On First Principles, the metaphysical\nsection of Nicholas of Damascus\u2019s On the Philosophy of\nAristotle, Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019s On the Principles\nof the Universe, the De aeternitate mundi contra\nAristotelem and other cosmological writings of\nPhiloponus\u2014the entire Greek exegetical tradition of the\nMetaphysics, from Aristotle\u2019s first disciples\n(Theophrastus) to his last interpreters/reformers (Philoponus), was\navailable to Arabic-speaking scholars.\n\nOn account of its long duration, the high rank of the scholars it\nengaged, and the breadth of its scope this area of the overall\ntranslation movement from Greek into Arabic cannot be reduced to a\nmere preliminary phase of the Arabic reception of the\nMetaphysics, but rather provides a specimen of the main\ntrends that characterized the first centuries of its history.\n",
