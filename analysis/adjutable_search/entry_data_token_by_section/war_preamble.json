    "main_text": "\n\nSome reject the very idea of the \u201cmorality of\n war\u201d.[1]\n Of those, some deny that morality applies at all once the guns strike\nup; for others, no plausible moral theory could license the\nexceptional horrors of war. The first group are sometimes called\nrealists. The second group are pacifists. The task of just war theory\nis to seek a middle path between them: to justify at least some wars,\nbut also to limit them (Ramsey 1961). Although realism undoubtedly has\nits adherents, few philosophers find it\n compelling.[2]\n The real challenge to just war theory comes from pacifism. And we\nshould remember, from the outset, that this challenge is real. The\njustified war might well be a chimera.\n\nHowever, this entry explores the middle path between realism and\npacifism. It begins by outlining the central substantive divide in\ncontemporary just war theory, before introducing the methodological\nschisms underpinning that debate. It then discusses the moral evaluation\nof wars as a whole, and of individual acts within war (traditionally,\nthough somewhat misleadingly, called jus ad bellum and\njus in bello respectively). \n\n\n",
