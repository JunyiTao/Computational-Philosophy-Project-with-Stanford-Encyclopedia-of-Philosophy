    "main_text": "Big Data Risks and the Ethics of Data Science\n10. Conclusion: Big Data and Good Science\n\nThis entry stressed how the emerging emphasis on big data signals the\nrise of a data-centric approach to research, in which efforts to\nmobilise, integrate, disseminate and visualise data are viewed as\ncentral contributions to discovery. The emergence of data-centrism\nhighlights the challenges involved in gathering, classifying and\ninterpreting data, and the concepts, technologies and institutions\nthat surround these processes. Tools such as high-throughput\nmeasurement instruments and apps for smartphones are fast generating\nlarge volumes of data in digital formats. In principle, these data are\nimmediately available for dissemination through internet platforms,\nwhich can make them accessible to anybody with a broadband connection\nin a matter of seconds. In practice, however, access to data is\nfraught with conceptual, technical, legal and ethical implications;\nand even when access can be granted, it does not guarantee that the\ndata can be fruitfully used to spur further research. Furthermore, the\nmathematical and computational tools developed to analyse big data are\noften opaque in their functioning and assumptions, leading to results\nwhose scientific meaning and credibility may be difficult to assess.\nThis increases the worry that big data science may be grounded upon,\nand ultimately supporting, the process of making human ingenuity\nhostage to an alien, artificial and ultimately unintelligible\nintelligence.\n\nPerhaps the most confronting aspect of big data science as discussed\nin this entry is the extent to which it deviates from understandings\nof rationality grounded on individual agency and cognitive abilities\n(on which much of contemporary philosophy of science is predicated).\nThe power of any one dataset to yield knowledge lies in the extent to\nwhich it can be linked with others: this is what lends high epistemic\nvalue to digital objects such as GPS locations or sequencing data, and\nwhat makes extensive data aggregation from a variety of sources into a\nhighly effective surveillance tool. Data production and dissemination\nchannels such as social media, governmental databases and research\nrepositories operate in a globalised, interlinked and distributed\nnetwork, whose functioning requires a wide variety of skills and\nexpertise. The distributed nature of decision-making involved in\ndeveloping big data infrastructures and analytics makes it impossible\nfor any one individual to retain oversight over the quality,\nscientific significance and potential social impact of the knowledge\nbeing produced.\n\nBig data analysis may therefore constitute the ultimate instance of a\ndistributed cognitive system. Where does this leave accountability\nquestions? Many individuals, groups and institutions end up sharing\nresponsibility for the conceptual interpretation and social outcomes\nof specific data uses. A key challenge for big data governance is to\nfind mechanisms for allocating responsibilities across this complex\nnetwork, so that erroneous and unwarranted decisions\u2014as well as\noutright fraudulent, unethical, abusive, discriminatory or misguided\nactions\u2014can be singled out, corrected and appropriately\nsanctioned. Thinking about the complex history, processing and use of\ndata can encourage philosophers to avoid ahistorical, uncontextualized\napproaches to questions of evidence, and instead consider the methods,\nskills, technologies and practices involved in handling data\u2014and\nparticularly big data\u2014as crucial to understanding empirical\nknowledge-making.\n",
