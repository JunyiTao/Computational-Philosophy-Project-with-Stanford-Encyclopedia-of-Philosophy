    "main_text": "Beyond the Standard Model || Quantum Gravity\n3.1 Quantum Gravity\n\nThe standard model of particle physics covers the electromagnetic, the\nweak and the strong interaction. However, the fourth fundamental force\nin nature, gravitation, has defied quantization so far. Although\nnumerous attempts have been made in the last 80 years, and in\nparticular very recently, there is no commonly accepted solution up to\nthe present day. One basic problem is that the mass, length and time\nscales quantum gravity theories are dealing with are so extremely\nsmall that it is almost impossible to test the different\nproposals.\n\n\nThe most important extant versions of quantum gravity theories are canonical quantum\ngravity, loop theory and string theory. Canonical quantum gravity\napproaches leave the basic structure of QFT untouched\nand just extend the realm of QFT by quantizing gravity.\nOther approaches try to reconcile quantum theory and general\nrelativity theory not by supplementing the reach of QFT but rather by\nchanging QFT itself. String theory, for instance, proposes a\ncompletely new view concerning the most fundamental building blocks:\nIt does not merely incorporate gravitation but it formulates a new\ntheory that describes all four interactions in a unified way, namely\nin terms of strings (see next subsection).\n\n\nWhile quantum gravity theories are very complicated and even more\nremote from classical thinking than QM, SRT and GRT, it is not so\ndifficult to see why gravitation is far more difficult to deal with\nthan the other three forces. Electromagnetic, weak and strong force\nall act in a given space-time. In contrast, gravitation is, according\nto GRT, not an interaction that takes place in time, but\ngravitational forces are identified with the curvature of space-time\nitself. Thus quantizing gravitation could amount to quantizing\nspace-time, and it is not at all clear what that could mean. One\ncontroversial proposal is to deprive space-time of its fundamental\nstatus by showing how it \u201cemerges \u201d in some\nnon-spatio-temporal theory. The \u201cemergence\u201d of space-time\nthen means that there are certain derived terms in the new theory that\nhave some formal features commonly associated with space-time. See\nKiefer (2007) for physical details, Rickles (2008) for an accessible\nand conceptually reflected introduction to quantum gravity and\nW\u00fcthrich (2005) for a philosophical evaluation of the alleged\nneed to quantize the gravitational field. Also, see the entry on\nquantum gravity.\n\n",
