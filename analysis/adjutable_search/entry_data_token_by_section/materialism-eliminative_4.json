    "main_text": "Contemporary Eliminative Materialism || Category Elimination\n2.3 Category Elimination\n\nWe have been treating eliminative materialism as a metaphysical claim\nabout the ontological status of the posits of commonsense psychology;\nas the claim that there exists nothing that corresponds to the concept\nin question \u2014 it picks out nothing real. This is analogous to\nwhat happened in the case of demons and crystal spheres. Because there\nare no such things, these concepts have no role to play in a proper\nscientific ontology. However, in recent years the term\n\u2018eliminativism\u2019 has been applied to a very different type\nof ontological stance toward the posits of commonsense psychology.\nThis alternative stance is that although the commonsense concept does\nindeed correspond with something real, the kind in question is, for a\nhost of reasons, ill-suited for serious scientific theorizing. Thus,\ndropping the commonsense concept from science is, at least in part,\ndue to pragmatic considerations about proper scientific practice.\nIrvine and Sprevak refer to this as \u201cdiscourse\neliminativism\u201d (Irvine and Sprevak, forthcoming). With\nconventional eliminative materialism, any token invoking of the mental\nstate concept or term will designate nothing \u2014 the concept or\nterm has no identifiable intentional object. By contrast, with this\nalternative picture, particular uses of a mental state concept or term\nmay indeed refer to some actual neurological state or condition that\nshares many of the features associated with the concept in question.\nHowever, because no legitimate scientific type maps properly onto the\nfolk psychological type, the latter should be dropped from the\ncategories of scientific psychology. So with this alternative\ninterpretation of eliminativism, the alleged problem with folk\npsychology has more to do with the classification system it provides\nfor certain types of mental states or processes; its criteria for\ndemarcation and categorization are grossly ill-suited for cognitive\nscience. The unscientific nature of the category may be due to a\nvariety of considerations (or combination of considerations) including\n(but not limited to) demarcation criteria that are overly subjective\nor context dependent, cut across more natural kinds, reduce to wildly\ndisjunctive arrays of real properties, fail to yield useful\ngeneralizations, collapse together useful levels of analysis, and so\non. Thus, this alternative conception of eliminativism is the exact\nconverse of certain forms of instrumentalism. Whereas an\ninstrumentalist might claim that there are no X\u2019s, but we should\ncontinue invoking or talking about X\u2019s in science for pragmatic\nreasons, a proponent of this alternative picture of eliminativism says\nthere really are X\u2019s, but we should stop using the category in\nscience for pragmatic reasons.\n\nTo see this a little better, consider our concept of weed. It\nis used in everyday life to pick out certain actual plants, but the\ncategory is badly ill-suited for science. The category of weeds is\nhighly subjective and cross-classifies a number of natural floral\nkinds. While it would be wrong to say there are no such things as\nweeds, the notion does not belong in the science of botany. The\nalternative conception of eliminativism is based on the idea that\ncertain commonsense psychological categories should be regarded as\nsimilar to the category of weeds. Although the folk notion in question\nmay correspond with something actual, the folk category should be\ndropped from the sciences of the mind because it is inappropriate for\nserious scientific theorizing and explanation.\n\nAn illustration of this alternative picture of eliminativism is\nprovided by Paul Griffiths\u2019 account of our commonsense notion of\nemotion (Griffiths, 1997). Griffiths argues that the category of\nemotion should be dropped from scientific psychology and replaced with\ncategories that are better grounded in scientific psychology and\nneuroscience. He points out that the folk concept cuts across three\ndifferent kinds of affective states: affect programs, higher cognitive\nemotions and social constructions. Affect programs are basic and\nautomatic states such as fear or anger that have an evolutionary basis\nand that are triggered by specific conditions. By contrast, higher\ncognitive emotions, like jealousy or shame, and social constructions\nare much less automatic and more easily influenced by a broader range\nof factors like higher-order thoughts or cultural conditioning.\nGriffiths argues that these psychological types are almost certainly\nsubserved by radically different cognitive mechanisms and consequently\nshould not be lumped together under some superordinate commonsense\ncategory of emotion. Griffiths develops a similar line of argument\nagainst emotion based upon levels of analysis and the difference\nbetween function-based taxonomies as opposed to lineage-based\ntaxonomies.\n\nA comparable type of outlook is endorsed by Edouard Machery with\nregard to our concept of (ironically) concepts (Machery,\n2008). Machery argues that because our folk notion of concept\ncorresponds to such a heterogeneous group of scientific kinds of\nstored information \u2014 including prototypes, exemplars, and\ntheories \u2014 then psychologists would be better off just using\nthese scientific categories and abandoning talk of concepts\naltogether. Similar sorts of arguments have been leveled against the\nfolk categories of belief (Stich, 1983), pain (Hardcastle, 1999),\nconsciousness (Irvine, 2012), and mental illness (Murphy and Stich,\n1999).\n\nOne problem with this gloss on eliminativism is that it often depends\nupon controversial normative claims about appropriate scientific\ntaxonomies. Many deny that, say, the highly disjunctive nature of a\ncommonsense notion is sufficient justification for dropping it. If it\nwas, we would eliminate the categories of memory and inference from\nscientific psychology. While authors like Griffiths and Machery\npresent very sophisticated arguments involving specific details about\nthe categories in question, most of these arguments either explicitly\nor tacitly make claims about the requirements of proper scientific\ncategorization that are highly contentious in the philosophy of\nscience (see, for example, the discussion in Machery, 2010).\n\nA second and more serious problem is that this alternative conception\nof eliminative materialism is not, strictly speaking, a type of\neliminative materialism. The claim that some category possesses\nmembers but the category itself is nevertheless ill-suited for science\nis not just a weaker version of the claim that a category is\nill-suited for science because it has no members. Say what\nyou will about weeds, clothing, pets and other kinds that are not\nscientifically respectable, it is clearly wrong to suggest these\nthings are not real. Thus, to avoid confusion, it would probably help\nif a term other than \u2018eliminativism\u2019 was adopted to\ndesignate this alternative conception. Irvine and Sprevak\u2019s\n\u2018discourse eliminativism\u2019 is problematic because, besides\nwrongly implying it is a version of eliminativism, there can also be\ndiscourse changes that involve the elimination of a term but where the\nrelevant relabeled category is fully retained. The term\n\u2018consumption\u2019 has been dropped from our scientific\nnomenclature, but it successfully referred to the legitimately\ntaxonomized disease we now refer to as \u2018tuberculosis\u2019.\nPerhaps a phrase like \u2018category dissolution\u2019 or\n\u2018conceptual fragmentation\u2019 would more accurately capture\nthe sort of thing that people like Griffiths and Machery have in\nmind.\n",
