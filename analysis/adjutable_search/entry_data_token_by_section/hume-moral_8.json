    "main_text": "Honesty with Respect to Property || The Circle\n10.1 The Circle\n\n\nHume offers a rather cryptic argument to show that our approval of\nmaterial honesty must be the product of collaborative human effort\n(convention). When we approve an action, he says, we regard it merely\nas the sign of the motivating passion in the agent\u2019s \u201cmind and\ntemper\u201d that produced it; our evaluation of the action is derived\nfrom our assessment of this inner motive. Therefore all actions deemed\nvirtuous derive their goodness only from virtuous motives \u2014\nmotives we approve. It follows from this that the motive that\noriginally \u201cbestows a merit on any action\u201d can never be\nmoral approval of that action (awareness of its virtue), but must be a\nnon-moral, motivating psychological state \u2014 that is, a state\ndistinct from the \u201cregard to the virtue\u201d of an action\n(moral approval or disapproval) (T 3.2.1.4). For if the\nvirtue-bestowing motive of the action were the agent\u2019s sense that the\nact would be virtuous to do \u2014 if that were why he did it, and why\nwe approved it \u2014 then we would be reasoning in a vicious circle:\nwe would approve of the action derivatively, because we approve of the\nagent\u2019s motive, and this motive would consist of approval of the\naction, which can only be based on approval of a motive... The basis of\nour approval could not be specified. For every virtue, therefore, there\nmust be some non-moral motive that characteristically\nmotivates actions expressive of that virtue, which motive, by eliciting\nour approval, makes the actions so motivated virtuous. The virtue of an\naction of this species would be established by its being done from this\nnon-moral motive, and only then could an agent also or alternatively be\nmoved so to act by her derivative concern for the virtue of the act.\nHowever, Hume observes that there is no morally approved (and\nso virtue-bestowing), non-moral motive of honest action. The only\napproved, reliable motive that we can find for acts of\n\u201cequity\u201d is a moral one, the sense of virtue or \u201cregard to\nthe honesty\u201d of the actions. The honest individual repays a loan not\n(merely) out of self-interest or concern for the well-being of the\nlender (who may be a \u201cprofligate debauchee\u201d who will reap\nonly harm from his possessions), but from a \u201cregard to justice,\nand abhorrence of villainy and knavery\u201d (T 3.2.1.9, 13). This,\nhowever, is \u201cevident sophistry and reasoning in a\ncircle\u2026\u201d Now nature cannot have \u201cestablish\u2019d a\nsophistry, and render\u2019d it necessary and unavoidable\u2026\u201d;\ntherefore, \u201cthe sense of justice and injustice is not deriv\u2019d\nfrom nature, but arises artificially\u2026 from education, and human\nconventions\u201d (T 3.2.1.17). Whatever, exactly, the logic of this\nargument is supposed to be, Hume\u2019s intent is to show that if we imagine\nequity to be a natural virtue we commit ourselves to a sophistry, and\ntherefore honesty is instead man-made.\n\n\nHume offers an account of the genesis of the social convention that\ncreates honesty with respect to property, and this is meant\nto cope in some way with the circularity he identifies. How it does so\nis a matter of interpretive controversy, as we will see.\n",
