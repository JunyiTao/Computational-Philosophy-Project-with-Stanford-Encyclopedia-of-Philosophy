    "main_text": "Moral Theory and Clinical Bioethics || Clinical Ethics and Moral Theory\n7.2 Clinical Ethics and Moral Theory\n\nTurning to the second area of discussion, we have a more explicit look\nat the role of moral theory in clinical ethics consultation. Four\nimportant roles for moral theory in clinical ethics consultation have\nbeen suggested:\n\naiding in the initial awareness and identification of the moral\nchallenges;\nassisting in the analysis of moral challenges;\ncontributing to a sound process and dialogue;\ninspiring an attitude of reflexivity and interpretation\n(Magelssen, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde 2016, 27\u201331).\n\n\nThe advantages of a clinical ethicist\u2019s being familiar with\nmoral theory have also been discussed. There is some advantage not\njust in using a moral theory to help one analyze and formulate\narguments, but also in considering the variety of perspectives and\nquestions made perspicuous by various ethical theories, and the issues\nthey illuminate. As well, when it comes to the consistency of a\nclinical ethicist\u2019s own argumentation, familiarity with moral\ntheory will help clinical ethicists spot weaknesses in their own\narguments or in those of others.\n\nHowever, matters are not quite so simple. To start, it is possible for\nthose with no training in moral philosophy to have a solid handle on\nthe moral dilemma with which they are dealing. And at the same time,\nsome say, having a philosopher, one who is an expert in moral theory,\nas a clinical ethicist does not guarantee that the ethics consult will\nbe of high quality. Knowledge of moral theory within the clinical\nethics realm is not always clearly helpful, and its possible benefits\nare not without accompanying drawbacks. First, if used too strictly,\nand adhered to too inflexibly, moral theories can hamper moral\nimagination and intuition, and obscure access to the insights of, for\nexample, common morality. Second, those in command of a wide range of\nmoral theories might be tempted to draw upon the moral theory that\nactually justifies a course of action already preferred or even\nsettled upon, rather than use what is deemed in advance to be the best\nmoral theory to work through what is the justifiable course of action\n(or what are the best action options). Third, moral theories can\nmislead, by, for instance, being used to frame cases in ways that\nemphasize irrelevancies. And fourth, without quite advanced knowledge\nand skill, ethical theories may easily be misunderstood and used\nimproperly. An example here would be taking Kantian moral theory to\nmandate no person ever being treated as a means\n(Magelssen, Pedersen, & F\u00f8rde 2016). The message here\nis that knowledge of moral theory can sometimes actually be an\nimpediment to good clinical ethics.\n\nOverall, moral theory has a role to play in clinical ethics, at least\nif we accept the goals of ethics consultation as assumed by the\ngenerally accepted model of ethics consultation. The more explicit\nconversation in this area recognizes the advantages the use of moral\ntheory offers clinical ethics and the consultation process. However,\nthe discussion in the literature also cautions against a wholesale\nendorsement of the notion that those working in clinical ethics are\nalways better for having an in-depth knowledge of moral theory.\n",
