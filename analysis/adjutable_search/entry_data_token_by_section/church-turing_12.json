    "main_text": "Backstory: Emergence of the concepts of effective method and decision method || Peirce\n2.4 Peirce\n\nIn 1886, in a letter to Marquand, Peirce famously suggested that\nMarquand consider an electrical version of his machine, and he\nsketched simple switching circuits implementing (what we would now\ncall) an AND-gate and an OR-gate\u2014possibly the earliest proposal\nfor electrical computation (Peirce 1886). Far-sightedly, Peirce wrote\nin the letter that, with the use of electricity, \u201cit is by no\nmeans hopeless to expect to make a machine for really very difficult\nmathematical problems\u201d. Much later, Church discovered a detailed\ndiagram of an electrical relay-based form of Marquand\u2019s machine\namong Marquand\u2019s papers at Princeton (reproduced in Ketner &\nStewart 1984: 200). Whoever worked out the design in this\ndiagram\u2014Marquand, Peirce, or an unknown third person\u2014has a\nclaim to be an important early pioneer of electromechanical\ncomputing.\n\nPeirce, with his interest in logic machines, seems to have been the\nfirst to consider the decision problem in roughly the form in which\nTuring and Church tackled it. From about 1896, he developed the\ndiagrammatic proof procedures he called \u201cexistential\ngraphs\u201d. These were much more advanced than Venn\u2019s\ndiagrams. Peirce\u2019s system of alpha-graphs is a\ndiagrammatic formulation of the propositional calculus, and his system\nof beta-graphs is a version of the first-order functional\ncalculus (Peirce 1903a; Roberts 1973). Roberts (1973) proved that the\nbeta-graphs system contains the axioms and rules of Quine\u2019s 1951\nformulation of the first-order functional calculus, in which only\nclosed formulae are asserted (Quine 1951: 88).\n\nPeirce anticipated the concept of a decision method in his extensive\nnotes for a series of lectures he delivered in Boston in 1903. There\nhe developed a method (Peirce 1903b,c) that, if applied to any given\nformula of the propositional calculus, would, he said,\n\u201cdetermine\u201d (or \u201cpositively ascertain\u201d)\nwhether the alpha-graphs system demonstrates that the formula is\nsatisfiable (is \u201calpha-possible\u201d, in Peirce\u2019s\nterminology), or whether, on the other hand, the system demonstrates\nthat it is unsatisfiable (\u201calpha-impossible\u201d). (See the\n Supplement\n for an explanation of \u201csatisfiable\u201d.) Peirce said his\nmethod \u201cis such a comprehensive routine that it would be easy to\ndefine a machine that would perform it\u201d\u2014although the\n\u201ccomplexity of the case\u201d, he continued, \u201crenders any\nsuch procedure quite impracticable\u201d (Peirce 1903c). Perhaps he\nwould not have been completely surprised to learn that within five or\nsix decades, and with the use of electricity, it became far from\nimpractical to run a decision method for the propositional calculus on\na machine.\n\nPeirce also searched\u2014in vain, of course\u2014for a\ncorresponding method for his beta-graphs system (Peirce 1903b,c,d;\nRoberts 1997). Like Hilbert after him, he seems to have entertained no\ndoubt that full first-order predicate logic is amenable to a\nmachine-like method.\n\nPeirce had prescient ideas about the use of machines in mathematics\nmore generally. Around the turn of the century, he wrote:\n\n\n[T]he whole science of higher arithmetic, with its hundreds of\nmarvellous theorems, has in fact been deduced from six primary\nassumptions about number. The logical machines hitherto constructed\nare inadequate to the performance of mathematical deductions. There\nis, however, a modern Exact Logic which, although yet in its infancy,\nis already far enough advanced to render it a mere question of expense\nto construct a machine that would grind out all the known theorems of\narithmetic and advance that science still more rapidly than it is now\nprogressing. (Peirce n.d., quoted in Stjernfelt 2022)\n\n\nHere Peirce seems to be asserting\u2014quite correctly\u2014that a\nmachine can be devised to grind out all the theorems of\nDedekind\u2019s (1888) axiomatisation of arithmetic (which consisted\nof six \u201cprimary assumptions\u201d in the form of of four axioms\nand two definitions). This statement of Peirce\u2019s, made almost\nfour decades before Turing introduced Turing machines into\nmathematics, was well ahead of its time.\n\nAs to whether all mathematical reasoning can be performed by\na machine, as Leibniz seems to have thought, Peirce was fiercely\nskeptical. He formulated the hypothesis that, in the future,\nmathematical reasoning\n\n\nmight conceivably be left to a machine\u2014some Babbage\u2019s\nanalytical engine or some logical machine. (Peirce 1908: 434)\n\n\nHowever, he placed this hypothesis alongside others he deemed\n\u201clogical heresies\u201d, calling it \u201cmalignant\u201d\n(ibid.). His skeptical attitude, if perhaps not his reasons for it,\nwas arguably vindicated by Turing\u2019s subsequent results (Turing\n1936, 1939). But before that, a quite different view of matters took\nroot among mathematicians, under the influence of Hilbert and his\ngroup at G\u00f6ttingen.\n",
