    "main_text": "Related Views || Friederich\n5.1 Friederich\n\nFriederich (2011, 2015) favors what he calls a therapeutic approach to\ninterpreting quantum theory, taking his cue from the later philosophy\nof Ludwig Wittgenstein. This approach grounds the objectivity of\nquantum state assignments in the implicit constitutive rules governing\nthis practice. Those rules determine the state an agent has to assign\ndepending on her knowledge of the values of observables, perhaps\nobtained by consulting the outcome of their measurement on the system.\nFriederich agrees with Healey that differently situated agents may\ntherefore have to assign different states to the same system in the\nsame circumstances insofar as their situations permit some to consult\noutcomes inaccessible to others, and makes the point by saying a\nsystem is not \\(in\\) whichever quantum state it is assigned.\n\nFriederich treats quantum probabilities as rational quasi-Lewisian\nconstraints on credence and, together with his relational account of\nquantum states, this enables him to refute the claim that Bell\u2019s\ntheorem demonstrates instantaneous action at a distance. He uses (what\nhe calls) his epistemic conception of quantum states to dissolve the\nmeasurement problem by denying that an entangled superposition of\nsystem and apparatus quantum states is incompatible with the\noccurrence of a definite, unique outcome. Like Healey, he appeals to\ndecoherence in picking out the particular observable(s) a suitable\ninteraction may be considered to measure.\n\nSo far Friederich\u2019s therapeutic approach parallels\nHealey\u2019s pragmatist approach (though there are significant\ndifferences of detail, especially as regards their treatments of\nprobability and causation). But Friederich rejects Healey\u2019s\ninferentialist account of the content of claims about the values of\nphysical magnitudes, taking restrictions on legitimate applications of\nthe Born Rule to follow directly from the constitutive rules governing\nits use rather than from the need to apply it only to magnitude claims\nwith well-defined content. And Friederich seriously explores the\npossibility that a set of magnitude claims collectively assigning a\nprecise value to all dynamical variables may be not only\nmeaningful but true together. His idea is that the constitutive rules\ngoverning the Born Rule may forbid any attempt to apply the rule in a\nway that would imply the existence of a non-contextual probability\ndistribution over their possible values, thus avoiding conflict with\nno-go theorems like that of Kochen and Specker.\n",
