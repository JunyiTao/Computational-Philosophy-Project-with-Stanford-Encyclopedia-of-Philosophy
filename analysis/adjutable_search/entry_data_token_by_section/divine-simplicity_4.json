    "main_text": "Constituent Versus Nonconstituent Ontology || God and His Existence\n3.2 God and His Existence\n\nTaking the first question first, on a Plantinga-style approach, it\nmakes no sense to say that God is identical either to existence or to\nhis existence. For Plantinga, existence is a first-level\nproperty that everything exemplifies. Given that\n\u201cexemplifies\u201d picks out a two-term irreflexive and\nasymmetrical relation, God cannot be identical with existence. Nor can\nGod be identical to his existence. The latter is presumably a\nstate of affairs, an abstract object, and no concretum can be\nidentical with an abstractum on pain of violating the separateness of\nthe concrete and abstract realms. There are, however, plenty of\nreasons (Vallicella 2002, Ch. 2) to reject the view that existence is\na first-level property and the ontological schemes that entail it. One\nintuition that many share is that existence is not one of an\nindividual\u2019s properties, but that in virtue of which it has any\nproperties in the first place: it is more like the unity or cohesion\nof an individual\u2019s properties (Vallicella 2002, Ch. 6).\n\nAnother route to the identity of God with his existence is via the\ndivine necessity. Although it is true to say that a contingent being\nis one that exists in some, but not all, metaphysically possible\nworlds, that is not what makes a contingent being contingent. What\nmakes a contingent being contingent is the real distinction in it\nbetween essence and existence. What makes an absolutely necessary\nbeing necessary, then, is the lack of such a distinction. God, who has\nhis necessity from himself and not from another, is therefore\nidentical to his existence. One can say, if one likes, that God exists\nin all metaphysically possible worlds, but that is true only because\nin God essence and existence are the same. The divine simplicity is\nthe ground of the divine necessity. Given the way our minds work, we\ncannot think of God without distinguishing between essence and\nexistence; but that is our affair and not God\u2019s. In reality, God\nis his existence.\n",
