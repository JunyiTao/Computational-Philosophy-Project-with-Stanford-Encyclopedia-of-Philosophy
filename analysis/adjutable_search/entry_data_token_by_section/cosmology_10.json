But cosmologists have pursued a\nvariety of questions that extend beyond these core theories. In these\ndomains, cosmologists face a form of underdetermination: should a\nphenomena be accounted for by extending the core theories, or by\nchanging physical or astrophysical assumptions?\n\nThe Soviet physicist Yakov Zel\u2019dovich memorably called the early\nuniverse the \u201cpoor man\u2019s accelerator\u201d, because\nrelatively inexpensive observations of the early universe may reveal\nfeatures of high-energy physics well beyond the reach of even the most\nlavishly funded earth-bound accelerators. For many aspects of\nfundamental physics, including quantum gravity in particular,\ncosmology provides the only feasible way to assess competing ideas.\nThis ambitious conception of cosmology as the sole testing ground for\nnew physics extends beyond the standard model of particle physics\n(which is generally thought to be incomplete, even though there are no\nobservations that contradict it). Big bang nucleosynthesis, for\nexample, is an application of well-tested nuclear physics to the early\nuniverse, with scattering cross-sections and other relevant features\nof the physics fixed by terrestrial experiments. While working out how\nnuclear physics applied in detail required substantial effort, there\nwas little uncertainty regarding the underlying physics. By contrast,\nin some domains cosmologists now aim to explain the universe\u2019s\nhistory while at the same time evaluating new physics used in\nconstructing it.\n\nThis contrast can be clarified in terms of the \u201cphysics\nhorizon\u201d (Ellis 2007), which delimits the physical regime\naccessible to terrestrial experiments and observations, roughly in\nterms of energy scales associated with different interactions. The\nhorizon can be characterized more precisely for a chosen theory, by\nspecifying the regions of parameter space that can be directly tested\nby experiments and\n observations.[23]\n Aspects of cosmological theories that extend past the physics horizon\ncannot be independently tested through non-cosmological experiments or\nobservations; the only empirical route to evaluating these ideas is\nthrough their implications for cosmology. (This is not to deny that\nthere may be strong theoretical grounds to favor particular proposals,\nas extensions of the core theories.)\n\nCosmological physics extending beyond the physics horizon faces an\nunderdetermination threat due to the lack of independent lines of\nrelevant evidence. The case of dark matter illustrates the value of\nsuch independent evidence. Dark matter was first proposed to account\nfor the dynamical behavior of galaxy clusters and galaxies, which\ncould not be explained using Newtonian gravitational theory with only\nthe luminous matter observed. Dark matter also plays a crucial role in\naccounts of structure formation, as it provides the scaffolding\nnecessary for baryonic matter to clump, without conflicting with the\nuniformity of the\n CMB.[24]\n Both inferences to the existence of dark matter rely on gravitational\nphysics, raising the question of whether we should take these\nphenomena as evidence that our gravitational theory fails, rather than\nas evidence for a new type of matter. There is an active research\nprogram (MOND, for Modified Newtonian\nDynamics) devoted to accounting for the relevant phenomena by\nmodifying gravity. Regardless of one\u2019s stance on the relative\nmerits of MOND vs. dark matter (obviously MOND needs to be extended to\na relativistic theory), direct evidence of existence of dark matter,\nor indirect evidence via decay products, would certainly reshape the\ndebate. Efforts have been underway for some time to find dark matter\nparticles through direct interactions with a detector, mediated by the\nweak force. A positive outcome of these experiments would provide\nevidence of the existence of dark matter that does not depend upon\ngravitational\n theory.[25]\n\n\nSuch independent evidence is not available for two prominent examples\nof new physics motivated by discoveries in cosmology. \u201cDark\nenergy\u201d was introduced in studies of structure formation, which\nemployed a non-zero cosmological constant to fit observational\nconstraints (the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM models). Subsequent observations of\nthe redshift-distance relation, using supernovae (type Ia) as a\nstandard candle, led to the discovery that the expansion of the\nuniverse is\n accelerating.[26]\n (For \\(\\ddot{R}>0\\) in an FLRW model, there must be a contribution\nthat appears in eqn. (\\(\\ref{eq:Ray}\\)) like a positive \\(\\Lambda\\)\nterm.) Rather than treating these observations as simply determining\nthe value of a parameter in the SM, many cosmologists have developed\nphenomenological models of \u201cdark energy\u201d that leads to an\neffective \\(\\Lambda\\). Unlike dark matter, however, the properties of\ndark energy insure that any attempt at non-cosmological detection\nwould be futile: the energy density is so small, and uniform, that any\nlocal experimental study of its properties is practically impossible.\nFurthermore these models are not based in well-motivated physics: they\nhave the nature of \u2018saving the phenomena\u2019 in that they are\ntailored to fitting the cosmological observations by curve\n fitting.[27]\n\n\nInflationary cosmology originally promised a powerful unification of\nparticle physics and cosmology. The earliest inflationary models\nexplored the consequences of specific scalar fields introduced in\nparticle physics (the then supposed Higgs field for the strong\ninteractions). Yet theory soon shifted to treating the scalar field\nresponsible for inflation as the \u201cinflaton\u201d field, leaving\nits relationship to particle physics unresolved, and the promise of\nunification unfulfilled. If the properties of the inflaton field are\nunconstrained, inflationary cosmology is extremely flexible; it is\npossible to construct an inflationary model that matches any chosen\nevolutionary history of the early\n universe.[28]\n Specific models of inflation, insofar as they specify the features of\nthe field or fields driving inflation and its initial state, do have\npredictive content. In principle, cosmological observations could\ndetermine some of the properties of the inflaton field and so select\namong them (Martin et al. 2014). This could in principle then have\nimplications for a variety of other experiments or observations; yet\nin practice the features of the inflaton field in most viable models\nof inflation guarantee that it cannot be detected in other regimes.\nThe one exception to this is if the inflaton were the electroweak\nHiggs particle detected at the LHC (Ellis & Uzan 2014). This\nremains a viable inflaton candidate, so testing if it is indeed the\ninflaton is an important task (Bezrukov & Gorbunov 2012).\n\nThe physics horizon poses a challenge because one particularly\npowerful type of evidence\u2014direct experimental detection or\nobservation, with no dependence on cosmological assumptions\u2014is\nunavailable for the physics relevant at earliest times (before\ninflation, and indeed even for baryosynthesis after inflation). Yet\nthis does not imply that competing theories, such as dark matter vs.\nmodified gravity, should be given equal credence. The case in favor of\ndark matter draws on diverse phenomena, and it has been difficult to\nproduce a compelling modified theory of gravity, consistent with GR,\nthat captures the full range of phenomena as an alternative to dark\nmatter. Cosmology typically demands a more intricate assessment of\nbackground assumptions, and the degree of independence of different\ntests, in evaluating proposed extensions of the core theories. Yet\nthis evidence may still be sufficiently strong, in the sense discussed\nmore fully in\n \u00a75\n below, to justify new physics.\n",
