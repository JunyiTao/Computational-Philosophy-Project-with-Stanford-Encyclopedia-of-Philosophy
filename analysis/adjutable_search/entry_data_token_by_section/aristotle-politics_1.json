    "main_text": "Aristotle\u2019s View of Politics\n2. Aristotle\u2019s View of Politics\n\nPolitical science studies the tasks of the politician or statesman\n(politikos), in much the way that medical science concerns\nthe work of the physician (see Politics IV.1). It is, in\nfact, the body of knowledge that such practitioners, if truly expert,\nwill also wield in pursuing their tasks. The most important task for\nthe politician is, in the role of lawgiver\n(nomothet\u00eas), to frame the appropriate constitution for\nthe city-state. This involves enduring laws, customs, and institutions\n(including a system of moral education) for the citizens. Once the\nconstitution is in place, the politician needs to take the appropriate\nmeasures to maintain it, to introduce reforms when he finds them\nnecessary, and to prevent developments which might subvert the\npolitical system. This is the province of legislative science, which\nAristotle regards as more important than politics as exercised in\neveryday political activity such as the passing of decrees (see\nEN VI.8).\n\nAristotle frequently compares the politician to a craftsman. The\nanalogy is imprecise because politics, in the strict sense of\nlegislative science, is a form of practical knowledge, while a craft\nlike architecture or medicine is a form of productive knowledge.\nHowever, the comparison is valid to the extent that the politician\nproduces, operates, maintains a legal system according to universal\nprinciples (EN VI.8 and X.9). In order to appreciate this\nanalogy it is helpful to observe that Aristotle explains the\nproduction of an artifact such as a drinking cup in terms of four\ncauses: the material, formal, efficient, and final causes\n(Phys. II.3 and Met. A.2). For example, clay\n(material cause) is molded into a roughly cylindrical shape\nclosed at one end (formal cause) by a potter (efficient or moving\ncause) so that it can contain a beverage (final cause). (For\ndiscussion of the four causes see the entry on\n Aristotle\u2019s physics.)\n\nOne can also explain the existence of the city-state in terms of the\nfour causes. It is a kind of community (koin\u00f4nia), that\nis, a collection of parts having some functions and interests in\ncommon (Pol. II.1.1261a18, III.1.1275b20). Hence, it is made\nup of parts, which Aristotle describes in various ways in different\ncontexts: as households, or economic classes (e.g., the rich and the\npoor), or demes (i.e., local political units). But, ultimately, the\ncity-state is composed of individual citizens (see\nIII.1.1274a38\u201341), who, along with natural resources, are the\n\u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201cequipment\u201d out of which the\ncity-state is fashioned (see VII.14.1325b38\u201341).\n\nThe formal cause of the city-state is its constitution\n(politeia). Aristotle defines the constitution as \u201ca\ncertain ordering of the inhabitants of the city-state\u201d\n(III.1.1274b32\u201341). He also speaks of the constitution of a community\nas \u201cthe form of the compound\u201d and argues that whether the\ncommunity is the same over time depends on whether it has the same\nconstitution (III.3.1276b1\u201311). The constitution is not a\nwritten document, but an immanent organizing principle, analogous to\nthe soul of an organism. Hence, the constitution is also \u201cthe\nway of life\u201d of the citizens (IV.11.1295a40\u2013b1, VII.8.1328b1\u20132).\nHere the citizens are that minority of the resident population who\npossess full political rights (III.1.1275b17\u201320).\n\nThe existence of the city-state also requires an efficient cause,\nnamely, its ruler. On Aristotle\u2019s view, a community of any sort can\npossess order only if it has a ruling element or authority. This\nruling principle is defined by the constitution, which sets criteria\nfor political offices, particularly the sovereign office\n(III.6.1278b8\u201310; cf. IV.1.1289a15\u201318). However, on a\ndeeper level, there must be an efficient cause to explain why a\ncity-state acquires its constitution in the first place. Aristotle\nstates that \u201cthe person who first established [the city-state]\nis the cause of very great benefits\u201d (I.2.1253a30\u20131). This\nperson was evidently the lawgiver (nomothet\u00eas), someone\nlike Solon of Athens or Lycurgus of Sparta, who founded the\nconstitution. Aristotle compares the lawgiver, or the politician more\ngenerally, to a craftsman (d\u00eamiourgos) like a weaver or\nshipbuilder, who fashions material into a finished product\n(II.12.1273b32\u20133, VII.4.1325b40\u20131365a5).\n\nThe notion of final cause dominates Aristotle\u2019s Politics from\nthe opening lines:\n\nSince we see that every city-state is a sort of community and that\nevery community is established for the sake of some good (for everyone\ndoes everything for the sake of what they believe to be good), it is\nclear that every community aims at some good, and the community which\nhas the most authority of all and includes all the others aims\nhighest, that is, at the good with the most authority. This is what is\ncalled the city-state or political community. [I.1.1252a1\u20137]\n\n\nSoon after, he states that the city-state comes into being for the\nsake of life but exists for the sake of the good life\n(2.1252b29\u201330). The theme that the good life or happiness is the\nproper end of the city-state recurs throughout the Politics\n(III.6.1278b17\u201324, 9.1280b39; VII.2.1325a7\u201310).\n\nTo sum up, the city-state is a hylomorphic (i.e., matter-form)\ncompound of a particular population (i.e., citizen-body) in a given\nterritory (material cause) and a constitution (formal cause). The\nconstitution itself is fashioned by the lawgiver and is governed by\npoliticians, who are like craftsmen (efficient cause), and the\nconstitution defines the aim of the city-state (final cause,\nIV.1.1289a17\u201318). Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphic analysis has important\npractical implications for him: just as a craftsman should not try to\nimpose a form on materials for which it is unsuited (e.g. to build a\nhouse out of sand), the legislator should not lay down or change laws\nwhich are contrary to the nature of the citizens. Aristotle\naccordingly rejects utopian schemes such as the proposal in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic that children and property should belong to all the\ncitizens in common. For this runs afoul of the fact that \u201cpeople give\nmost attention to their own property, less to what is communal, or\nonly as much as falls to them to give attention\u201d (Pol.\nII.3.1261b33\u20135). Aristotle is also wary of casual political\ninnovation, because it can have the deleterious side-effect of\nundermining the citizens\u2019 habit of obeying the law\n(II.8.1269a13\u201324). For a further discussion of the theoretical\nfoundations of Aristotle\u2019s politics, see the following supplementary\ndocument:\n\nSupplement: Presuppositions of Aristotle\u2019s Politics\n\n\nIt is in these terms, then, that Aristotle understands the fundamental\nnormative problem of politics: What constitutional form should the\nlawgiver establish and preserve in what material for the sake of what\nend?\n",
