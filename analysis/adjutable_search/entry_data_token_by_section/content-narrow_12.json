    "main_text": "Conceptions of Narrow Content || The Mapping Conception\n4.3 The Mapping Conception\n\nWhite (1982) and Fodor (1987) have offered a rather different, and\nhighly influential, way of thinking about narrow content. This\nconception focuses on what narrow contents are supposed to accomplish.\nA narrow content is supposed to be something that Oscar and Twin Oscar\nshare, and by virtue of which Oscar believes that water is wet and\nTwin Oscar believes that XYZ is wet. Similarly, it should be something\nthat Art in his actual environment shares with Art in his envisioned\ncounterfactual environment, and by virtue of which he believes, in his\nactual environment, that he has arthritis in his thigh, and believes,\nin the counterfactual environment, that he has a different and broader\ndisease in his thigh. So one approach to narrow content is simply to\ndeclare that a narrow content is something that, given a particular\nenvironment, determines a particular broad content. Block (1991) calls\nthis the \u201cmapping theory,\u201d since on this account a narrow\ncontent maps environments into broad contents.\n\nSome care is required in determining what the relevant environments\nare. What matters is not only the environment the subject is currently\nin, but rather the environment in which the subject acquired the\nrelevant beliefs and other mental states. If we zipped Oscar to Twin\nEarth and Twin Oscar to Earth, we would not thereby change what their\nthoughts are about (at least not immediately). Oscar would still be\nthinking about water, and would probably misidentify XYZ as water;\nTwin Oscar would still be thinking about XYZ, and would probably\nmisidentify water as XYZ. What determines the broad content of their\nthoughts is not merely the environment they are in at the moment, but\nalso the environment in which they first acquired their thoughts and\nbeliefs about watery stuff. Provided we understand\n\u201ccontext\u201d to include both sorts of facts, we can describe\nthe mapping conception as a conception on which narrow content is a\nfunction from contexts to broad contents.\n\n(White (1982) actually distinguishes between \u201ccontexts of\nacquisition\u201d and \u201ccontexts of occurrence\u201d, and\ndefines a notion of \u201cpartial character\u201d as a higher-order\nfunction which takes a context of acquisition as argument and yields\nas the resulting value a function from contexts of occurrence to broad\ncontents. The relation between White\u2019s view and Fodor\u2019s is\neasier to see, however, if we employ a more inclusive conception of\ncontext that includes both one\u2019s current environment and\none\u2019s history of acquisition of the relevant concept. If we do,\nwe can collapse both levels of White\u2019s higher-order function\ninto one, yielding a lower-order function like Fodor\u2019s. The\nbroad content determined by a Fodorian narrow content applied to a\nparticular context is the same as the broad content determined by\napplying White\u2019s partial character to that context, and then\napplying the resulting function to the very same context.)\n\nThe mapping theory faces a number of difficulties. (1) As Fodor notes,\non the mapping view narrow content seems to be ineffable. We would\nlike to be able to say what the narrow content of a particular thought\nor belief is, but on Fodor\u2019s view this cannot be done. To\nexpress a narrow content we would presumably need to find an English\nexpression that is synonymous with it. But the content of English\nexpressions is broad, not narrow, so this seems to be impossible.\n\n(Valerie Walker (1990) and Stephen Stich (1991) propose that narrow\ncontents could be expressed if English were supplemented with a\n\u201cbracketing\u201d notation. For example, an expression of the\nform \u2018___ has the (narrow) content that [p]\u2019 is said to\nhave as its extension \u201cin any possible world the class of brain\nstate tokens whose (broad) content is p, along with physically\nidentical tokens in all doppelgangers of people who harbor tokens\nwhose broad content is p\u201d (Stich 1991, p. 247). The chief\ndifficulty with this proposal is that it has the consequence that\nevery token with a given broad content has the same narrow content.\nBut mental states with a particular broad content can be very unlike\none another: compare Oscar\u2019s belief that water is wet with that\nof an expert in chemistry, or the very different ways in which Pierre\nis related to the proposition that London is pretty. If narrow content\nis to be useful in explaining behavior and rational inference, it must\nbe the case not only that Twins share their narrow contents despite\ntheir different broad contents, but also that individuals with the\nsame broad content may have different narrow contents (Brown\n1993).)\n\n(2) A second difficulty noted by Fodor is that, like conceptual role\nsemantics, the mapping conception may not deserve to be called\n\u201ccontent,\u201d because the narrow contents it yields do not\nsuffice to determine truth conditions. A central characteristic of\nbroad content is that a thought or belief with broad content thereby\nhas truth conditions: in some possible circumstances it is true, and\nin others it is false. On the mapping conception, narrow content does\nnot suffice to determine truth conditions in this sense. To determine\ntruth conditions, one needs to fix not only a narrow content but also\na context. For instance, given the narrow content shared by Oscar and\nTwin Oscar when they think, \u201cLake Superior is full of\nwater,\u201d we do not have enough information to say whether that\nthought is true or false in a particular situation. Suppose Lake\nSuperior is full of XYZ. Then Twin Oscar\u2019s thought is true but\nOscar\u2019s thought is false, even though both thoughts have the\nsame narrow content. So it seems that narrow content by itself is not\nenough to determine what truth conditions a thought has. (However, see\nthe following section on \u201cDiagonal Propositions.\u201d)\n\n(3) Finally, although the mapping conception gives us an abstract,\nformal conception of narrow content, it does not give us an algorithm\nfor finding the narrow content of a particular state.\nAlthough apparently any function from contexts to contents would count\nas a \u201cnarrow content\u201d in Fodor\u2019s sense, some of\nthese functions could not really be the content of a mental state. To\nuse a computational analogy, we are really interested only in\n\u201ccomputable\u201d functions from context to content, functions\nthat can be implemented somehow in a human mind, and this suggests\nthat it is not the function itself that is of interest but rather the\nalgorithm by means of which it is computed.\n",
