    "main_text": "Justifications and Critiques || Lockean Justifications of Intellectual Property\n3.3 Lockean Justifications of Intellectual Property\n\nA different strategy for justifying intellectual property rights\nbegins with the claim that individuals are entitled to control the\nfruits of their labor (Locke 1690; Hettinger 1989; Becker 1993; Gordon\n1993; Moore 1998b; Hughes 1988; Palmer 2005; Himma 2005a, 2006, 2008,\n2013; Merges 2011). In general, the intuition is that the person who\nclears unowned land, cultivates crops, builds a house, or creates a\nnew invention obtains property rights by engaging in these activities.\nLaboring, producing, thinking, and persevering are voluntary, and\nindividuals who engage in these activities are entitled to what they\nproduce. Subject to certain restrictions, rights are generated when\nindividuals mix their labor with an unowned object. Restrictions or\nlimits on acquisition include a labor requirement, a non-waste\nrequirement, and the \u201cenough and as good\u201d proviso (Locke\n1690). Labor, for Locke, is best understood as metaphor for productive\nactivities needed to sustain and promote human flourishing (Mossoff\n2012). The non-waste requirement invalidates a property claim if the\nappropriator takes more than she can consume or use without spoilage.\nUnlike the labor metaphor, spoilage for Locke means rotting or the\ndestruction of an existing good useful for sustaining human life.\nFinally, the \u201cenough and as good\u201d proviso is best\nillustrated by an example Locke gives. When someone takes a drink of\nwater from a river it is as if he takes nothing at all. His fellows\nare, all things considered, unaffected by this acquisition.\n\nConsider a more formal version of Locke\u2019s famous argument.\nIndividuals own their own bodies and labor\u2014i.e., they are\nself-owners. When an individual labors on an unowned object, her labor\nbecomes infused in the object and for the most part, the labor and the\nobject cannot be separated. It follows that once a person\u2019s\nlabor is joined with an unowned object, assuming that individuals\nexclusively own their body and labor, rights to control are generated.\nThe idea is that there is an expansion of rights: we each own our\nlabor and when that labor is mixed with objects in the commons, our\nrights are expanded to include these goods.\n\nIn terms of intellectual property, the act of creation or discovery\ntypically takes time, effort, and skill. Intellectual works\ndon\u2019t spoil like apples, so there are no\n\u201cnon-waste\u201d concerns. Moreover, the creation or discovery\nseemingly leaves \u201cenough and as good.\u201d Creating a poem,\nfor example, and holding it as a secret does not preclude others from\ncreating their own poems.\n3.3.1 Objections to Locke\n\nLocke\u2019s argument is not without difficulties. Jeremy Waldron\n(1983) argued that the idea of mixing one\u2019s labor is\nincoherent\u2014actions cannot be mixed with objects. P. J. Proudhon\n(1840) argued that if labor was important, the second labor on an\nobject should ground a property right in an object as reliably as the\nfirst labor. Nozick (1974) asked why labor mixing generated property\nrights rather than a loss of labor. Waldron (1983) and Perry (1978)\nhave argued that mixing one\u2019s labor with an unowned object\nshould yield more limited rights than rights of full ownership.\nFinally, if the skills, tools, and inventions used in laboring are\nsocial products, then perhaps individual claims to title have been\nundermined (Grant 1987; Hettinger 1989).\n3.3.2 The Lockean Rejoinder\n\nAmong defenders of Lockean-based arguments for private property, these\nchallenges have not gone unnoticed (Spooner 1855; Schmidtz 1990; Mack\n1990; Simmons 1992; Child 1990; Moore 2001; Mossoff 2012; Claeys\n2017). Rather than rehearsing the points and counterpoints, consider a\nmodified version of the Lockean argument\u2014one that does not so\neasily fall prey to the objections mentioned above.\n\nAfter weeks of effort and numerous failures, suppose Ginger comes up\nwith an excellent new recipe for spicy noodles\u2014a recipe that she\nkeeps in her mind and does not write down. Would anyone argue that\nGinger does not have at least some minimal moral claim to control the\nrecipe? Suppose that Fred samples some of Ginger\u2019s noodles and\ndesires to purchase the recipe. Is there anything morally suspicious\nwith an agreement between them that grants Fred a limited right to use\nGinger\u2019s recipe provided that Fred does not disclose the\nprocess? Alas, Fred didn\u2019t have to agree to the terms and, no\nmatter how tasty the noodles, he could eat something else or create\nhis own recipe. Arguably, part of the moral weightiness of the\nagreement between Ginger and Fred relies on the fact that Ginger holds\nlegitimate title to the recipe. A slightly different way to put\nthis Lockean argument for intellectual property rights is:\n\n\nStep One: The Generation of Prima Facie Claims to Control\n\u2013 Suppose Ginger creates a new intellectual work \u2013\ncreation, effort, etc., yield her prima facie claims to control\n(similar to student desert for a grade).\n\nStep Two: Locke\u2019s Proviso \u2013 If the acquisition of\nan intellectual object makes no one (else) worse off in terms of their\nlevel of well-being compared to how they were immediately before the\nacquisition, then the taking is permitted.\n\nStep Three: From Prima Facie Claims to Property Rights\n\u2013 When are prima facie claims to control an intellectual work\nundefeated? Answer: when the proviso is satisfied. Alas, no one\nelse has been worsened \u2013 who could complain?\n\nConclusion: So long as no harm is done \u2013 the proviso is\nsatisfied \u2013 the prima facie claims that labor and effort may\ngenerate turn into property claims (Moore 2012).\n\n\nIn small communities it may even be possible to contract with all of\none\u2019s fellows securing all or some of the bundle of full\nownership. In this sort of example, every single member of the\ncommunity would be directly part of the agreement. Ginger says to her\npeers, \u201cif you want access to my recipe, then you will have to\nagree to my right to enjoy income\u201d and they reply \u201cbut\nsuch rights can\u2019t be indefinite \u2026 we as a community\nwon\u2019t be on the hook for defending this agreement\nindefinitely.\u201d In the ensuing give-and-take an agreement is\nhammered out. It is important to note that the moral bindingness of\nsuch an agreement is crucially dependent on the initial set of\nentitlement claims generated by labor, desert, and non-worsening. If\nGinger, in this case, was not the author of the recipe \u2014 suppose\nshe took it from someone else \u2014 it is not at all clear that the\nresulting contract would be morally or legally binding.\n\nMoving from small communities to larger ones a more general form of\nagreement between authors, inventors, and society can be considered.\nIf intellectual works are to be held as anything other than trade\nsecrets, walled off with narrow contracts like non-disclosure\nagreements or non-competition arrangements, there must be a way of\nsecuring access. Society may purchase access by offering limited\nrights to authors and inventors. Moreover, if some society does not\noffer this sort of protection, then innovators would likely employ\ntheir talents in other areas or simply move to a society where such\nagreements are recognized.\n",
