    "main_text": "Features of Civil Disobedience || Principled Disobedience\n1.1 Principled Disobedience\n\nLawbreaking: First, for an act to be civilly disobedient, it\nmust involve some breach of law. In democratic societies, civil\ndisobedience as such is not a crime. When an agent who engages in\ncivil disobedience is punished by the law, it is not for \u201ccivil\ndisobedience,\u201d but for the recognized offenses she commits, such\nas disturbing the peace, trespassing, damaging property, picketing,\nviolating official injunctions, intimidation, and so on.\n\nWhen civil disobedients directly break the law that they oppose\n\u2013 such as Rosa Parks violating the Montgomery, Alabama, city\nordinance requiring African Americans to sit at the back of public\nbuses and give up those seats to white riders if the front of the bus\nfilled up \u2013 they engage in direct civil disobedience.\nBy contrast, when disobedients break a law which, other things being\nequal, they do not oppose, in order to demonstrate their protest\nagainst another law or policy \u2013 such as anti-war protesters\nstaging sit-ins in government buildings \u2013 they engage in\nindirect civil disobedience. The distinction between direct\nand indirect civil disobedience is mainly relevant to the possibility\nof mounting constitutional test cases, since one cannot test the\nconstitutionality of a law in court without actually breaching it.\nAlthough some scholars argue that direct civil disobedience is\npreferable to its indirect counterpart because it is most clearly\nlegible as an act of protest against the law breached (C. Cohen 1966,\n4\u20135), most scholars maintain the acceptability of indirect\ndisobedience given that not all unjust laws or policies can be\ndisobeyed directly (M. Cohen 1970, 109\u2013110; Rawls 1999, 320;\nBrownlee 2012, 19\u201320). For instance, a same-sex couple living in\na jurisdiction that forbids same-sex marriage cannot get married in\nviolation of the law. Black Lives Matter activists cannot directly\ndisobey police brutality, stop-and-frisk policing, or the acquittal of\npolice officers who killed unarmed Blacks. Also, even when a person\ncan engage in direct disobedience of a law, doing so may be unduly\nburdensome, such as when the punishment for the breach would be\nextreme.\n\nPrincipledness: An act of lawbreaking must be deliberate,\nprincipled, and conscientious, if it is to be civil and, hence,\ndistinguishable from ordinary criminal offenses. Civil disobedience\ncannot be unintentional (say, done in ignorance of the fact that one\nis violating the law): it must be undertaken deliberately. Principled\ndisobedience can be distinguished from ordinary criminal offending by\nexamining the motives that underlie the disobedient act. The person\nmust intend to protest laws, policies, institutions, or practices that\nshe believes are unjust on the basis of her sincerely held moral or\npolitical commitments. The agent may not be correct or even entirely\nreasonable about her convictions, but she holds them sincerely. In\nthese ways, principled disobedience is distinct from garden-variety\ncriminal activity, which is generally self-interested and selfish,\nopportunistic and unprincipled.\n\nConscientiousness: The deliberate and principled features of\ncivil disobedience are often brought together under the umbrella of\nconscientiousness and equated with seriousness, sincerity, depth of\nconviction, and selflessness \u2013 again, in order to contrast civil\ndisobedience with criminal lawbreaking. In response, some scholars\nhighlight the pervasiveness of self-interested civil disobedience\n\u2013 of the \u2018not in my backyard\u2019 variety (e.g., people\nprotesting against a new highway passing through their neighborhood)\n\u2013 as a challenge to the supposed conscientiousness of all civil\ndisobedience (Celikates 2016, 38). Others insist that civil\ndisobedience need not be selfless: oppressed groups indeed have a lot\nto gain from their anti-oppression struggles, including better life\nprospects, improved material conditions, and heightened self-respect\n(Delmas 2019, 183\u20134). And, unsurprisingly, many of the most\nfamous civil disobedients \u2013 Mohandas Gandhi, Rosa Parks, Martin\nLuther King, Jr., Nelson Mandela \u2013 were members of the groups\nwhose rights they sought to champion. But conscientiousness \u2013\nunderstood as sincerity and seriousness \u2013 does not require\nselflessness, and ordinary crime should not be equated with\nselfishness, as the example of Robin Hood illustrates. That said, some\nthinkers also challenge the requirement of seriousness by regarding,\nfor example, the DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks\nundertaken by Anonymous, such as Operation: Avenge Assange,\nas acts of civil disobedience, despite their\n\u2018lulz-seeking\u2019, playful and non-serious motivations\n(Celikates and de Zeeuw 2016, 211\u20133).\n",
