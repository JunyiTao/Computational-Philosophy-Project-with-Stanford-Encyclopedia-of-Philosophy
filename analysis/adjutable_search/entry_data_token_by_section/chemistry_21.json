His distinction was intended to highlight the fact\nthat we could have a logical analysis of scientific justification in\nthe form of confirmation theory, but there could never be a logical\nprocedure for generating hypotheses. Hypothesis generation is the\ncreative part of science, while confirmation is the logical part. This\ndistinction has been challenged in recent years by those that see the\npath of discovery contributing to justification. But chemistry\nprovides a more interesting challenge to Reichenbach: It apparently\ngives us logics of discovery.\n\nThere are two subfields in which chemists sometimes speak of logics or\nprocedures for discovery. The first is synthetic chemistry. E.J. Corey\n(Corey & Cheng 1989) has proposed that the synthesis of organic\nmolecules can be rationally planned according to the logic of\nretrosynthetic analysis. Systematizing a long tradition in\nsynthetic organic chemistry, Corey shows how one can reason backwards\nfrom a target molecule by finding a series of\n\u201cdisconnections,\u201d bonds which one knows how to make. The\nresulting tree of disconnections gives potential pathways for\nsynthesis that can then be evaluated by plausibility, or simply tried\nout in the laboratory.\n\nAnother area where chemists have developed a logic for discovery is in\nthe area of drug design. Murray Goodman (Goodman & Ro 1995), for\nexample, proposed a four-step procedure for developing candidate\nmolecules for new medication. Say that you were interested in making a\ndrug that would more effectively target one of the morphine receptors\nin the brain. You start by making a molecular analogue of morphine,\nperhaps with a more constrained structure. After successful synthesis,\nyou study the molecule\u2019s three-dimensional structure by spectroscopy\nand computer simulation. You then test your molecule in a biological\nassay to see if you have successfully targeted the receptor and to\nwhat extent. Then based on the information you get, you modify the\nstructure, hopefully improving in each iteration.\n\nThese examples from chemistry put pressure on Reichenbach\u2019s claim that\nthere cannot be a logic of discovery. Moreover, they illustrate how,\nwhen a science is concerned with creating new things, procedures for\ndiscovery may become essential.\n",
