To do that is of\ncourse not to defend a representational theory or any other theory of\nthem. But it would be good to explain away the majority belief in such\nproperties, and some theorists do that in representational terms,\narguing that other, real properties are misrepresented in\nintrospection as WIL properties; Frankish (2016) calls this strategy\n\u201cillusionism.\u201d An obvious instance of such a\nmisrepresentation would be to mistake a sensory quality for a WIL\nproperty; since the conflation of the two is already rife even among\nsophisticated philosophers, WIL deniers may suggest that what was\nintrospected was only a sensory quality. (That is one way of\nunderstanding Dretske\u2019s position, bar his resistance to the very\nnotion of introspection as in Dretske (2003).) And as before, the\nphrase \u201cwhat it\u2019s like\u201d has nontendentiously been\nused as referring to a sensory quality rather than to a property of a\nwhole experience. Several authors point out that to reject WIL\nproperties is not to grant Chalmers\u2019 (1996) claim that for a\nzombie lacking WIL properties, \u201call is dark inside\u201d (pp.\n95\u20136).\n\nRey (1992) suggests that introspection mistakes the lack of detail it\ndelivers for the accurate representation of a simple ineffable\nproperty. Alternately or in addition (1995), having detected stable\nand identifiable complexes of involuntary responses to states of\nourselves and to living creatures who look and behave like us, for\nexample the commonsense causal, representational, conative and\naffective syndrome we lump together using the word \u2018pain\u2019,\nwe project a simple quality onto the others and into ourselves. Rey\nand Pereboom each compare the projection of WIL properties into the\nmind by introspection to vision\u2019s projection of simple\nhomogeneous color properties onto environmental objects.\n\nIllusionism is criticized by Strawson (2006), Prinz (2016), Balog\n(2016), Nida-R\u00fcmelin (2016), Schwitzgebel (2016), and Chalmers\n(2018). Though highly sympathetic to illusionism, Kammerer (2018)\nargues that no previously existing account can explain the strength of\nthe illusion. For general discussion, see the essays collected in\nFrankish (2017), and for further defense, see Shabasson (2022).\n",
