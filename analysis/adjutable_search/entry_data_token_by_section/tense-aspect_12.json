Cognitive aspects\n\nDue to limitations of space, we will not discuss psychological and\npsycholinguistic studies of tense but will focus solely on processing\nstudies of aspect. Moreover, within this topic we limit ourselves to\nstudies of the adult system. The interested reader is referred to\nDickey (2001) and the references therein for psycholinguistic work on\ntense as well as to the entry on\n the experience and perception of time\n\n and the contributions in Grondin (2008) for psychology of time in\ngeneral. \n\nPsychologists have recently begun studying event perception and its\nneural basis (e.g., Zacks and Tversky 2001; Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\n2001; Zacks et al. 2006). The underlying question behind this line of\nresearch is whether events play a role in how we cognitively structure\nand remember changing states of affairs and how they are represented.\nZacks, Tversky, and Iyer (2001) use an analogy from the domain of\nobjects to the domain of events to define an event as a \u201csegment\nin time at a given location that is conceived by an observer to have a\nbeginning and an end\u201d (p.30). They claim that \u201cthe ability\nto identify the parts of events and their relationships constitutes a\ndistinct perceptual process\u201d (p.30) which they call event\nstructure perception. Just as an object is an ontological\nprimitive in the spatial domain, so an event is an ontological\nprimitive in the spatio-temporal\n domain.[9]\n Objects are recognized by shape, color etc. and have boundaries in\nspace. Analogously, events have boundaries in time, but are also\nbounded in space. An event of buttering toast, for instance, happens\nat a particular time, but also in a particular location in space and\nis therefore spatially bounded. Continuing the analogy, both objects\nand events can be identified and categorized using hierarchical\nrelations. \n\n\nIn Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\u2019s experiments, participants segmented an\nongoing activity (like washing dishes) while watching it on\nfilm by pressing a key to mark \u201cnatural and meaningful\u201d\nunit boundaries. The grain at which participants segmented the\nactivity was manipulated between subjects: one group was asked to mark\nthe largest meaningful units (coarse grain size), the other group the\nsmallest units (fine grain size) which still could be considered to be\ncomplete events. The placement of perceived event boundaries provides\ninformation about the psychological status of events and their\npartonomic hierarchy. If the stream of action is perceived as\nconsisting of discrete events, participants should place event\nboundaries consistently and this is what Zacks, Tversky, and Iyer\n(2001) found. Further, if participants make use of partonomic\nhierarchies, coarse event boundaries should be aligned with fine\nboundaries, since the end of each superordinate event is also the end\nof its last subevent. Again, this hypothesis was corroborated by a\nstrong hierarchical bias effect. Events thus seem to be\npsychologically real and to be hierarchically structured. \n",
