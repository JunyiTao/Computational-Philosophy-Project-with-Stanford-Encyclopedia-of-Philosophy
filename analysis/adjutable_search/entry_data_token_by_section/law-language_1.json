    "main_text": "The use of language in law || Law and signs\n2.1 Law and signs\n\nThere are insurmountable objections to Bentham\u2019s idea that a law\nis an assemblage of signs. Law (in the sense that is relevant here) is\nthe systematic regulation of the life of a community by standards\ntreated as binding the members of the community and its institutions.\nA law is a standard that is part of such a systematic form of\nregulation. Many such standards have no canonical linguistic\nformulation (that is, no form of words which, according to law,\ndetermines the content of the standard). Lawyers in common law systems\nare familiar with such norms: murder may be a criminal offence (or\nslander may be a tort, or certain agreements may be enforceable as\ncontracts\u2026), not because of the expression by any person or\ninstitution of a rule that it should be so, but because the\ninstitutions of the legal system customarily treat murder as an\noffence (or slander as a tort...). Moreover, common law systems cannot\nbe distinguished from legal systems consisting only of linguistic\nacts, because no legal system consists only of linguistic acts. A\ncivil law system with a civil code and a criminal code may make murder\nan offence (and slander a tort\u2026) by a written act, and it may\nbe a written constitution that gives legal force to the civil code and\nto the criminal code. But the validity of the written constitution\nwill depend on a norm which is not created by the use of signs: the\nrule that the constitution makers\u2019 act of using that\ntext to set out the constitution is to be treated as\n authoritative.[2]\n\nBentham and John Austin knew that there are rules of law that were not\nlaid down in language. Preserving their view of law as signification\nof volition, they accounted for such laws as tacit commands\nof the sovereign. That convoluted device cannot provide the resources\nneeded to explain the existence of a norm. In the right circumstances,\nit is certainly possible to communicate without using signs (and in\nparticular, it is possible to convey a volition, backed by a threat of\nforce, just by saying or writing nothing). But silence can only be a\nmeans of communication when the circumstances give it a meaning. We\ncan say that a tacit command has been issued only if it is possible to\nidentify features of the situation that distinguish the tacit\ncommunication from mere inaction communicating nothing (see Hart 2012,\n45\u201348). Those features do not generally accompany customary\nrules (in fact, they generally do not accompany customary rules).\n\nThere is another conclusive objection to the idea that a law is an\nassemblage of signs. When a lawmaking authority does use language to\nmake a law (as when a legislature uses a lawful process to pass an\nenactment that is within its powers), the resulting law is not an\nassemblage of signs. When I write you an email message to make a\nrequest, the message is an assemblage of signs, but the request is not\nan assemblage of signs; I used the assemblage of signs to make it. The\nlaw that results from the use of language in an enactment is a norm or\nnorms whose existence and content are determined by the legal effect\nthat the law ascribes to that use of an assemblage of signs (see Von\nWright 1963, Chapter VI, on the distinction between norm formulations\nand norms).\n\nA law, therefore, is not an assemblage of signs, and law is not\nnecessarily made by the use of language, and every legal system has\nnorms that were not made by the use of language. Laws are not\nlinguistic acts. Laws, you may say, are standards of behaviour that\ncan be communicated (and some of which are made) by using language.\nBut even this is controversial among writers on legal\ninterpretation.\n",
