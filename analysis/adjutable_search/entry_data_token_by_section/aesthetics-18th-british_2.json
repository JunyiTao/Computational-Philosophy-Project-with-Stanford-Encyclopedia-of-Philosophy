    "main_text": "Internal-Sense Theories || Hume\n1.3 Hume\n\nHume takes his notion of taste over from Hutcheson. He regards taste\nas an \u201cinternal sense\u201d which depends on the operation of\nother mental faculties to \u201cpave the way\u201d for its\npronouncements by supplying it with an object upon which to pronounce\n(Hume 1751 [1986, 173]). Which mental faculties must operate, and which\noperations those faculties must perform, varies from object to\nobject:\n\n\u2026 in order to \u2026 give a proper discernment of [an object\nof taste], it is often necessary, we find, that much reasoning should\nprecede, that nice distinctions be made, just conclusions drawn,\ndistant comparisons formed, complicated relations examined, and\ngeneral facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of beauty,\nespecially the natural kinds, on their first appearance, command our\naffection and approbation \u2026 . But in many orders of beauty,\nparticularly those of the finer arts, it is requisite to employ much\nreasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment. (Hume 1751 [1986,\n173]).\n\n\nHume shows less interest than Hutcheson does in determining which\nfeature or features of objects result in our finding them beautiful.\nHutcheson, it will be recalled, argues that we take the pleasure of\nbeauty in response to all and only objects in which we find uniformity\namidst variety. Hume resists any such tidy formula, speaking of\nmultiple principles of taste. The only time he elaborates on any\nparticular principle is in The Treatise, where he holds, contra\nHutcheson, that the beauty we find in many objects owes, at least in\npart, to their usefulness. Hutcheson had denied that the usefulness of\nan object could play any role in our finding it beautiful, on the\ngrounds that judgments of taste are necessarily disinterested whereas\njudgments of usefulness are necessarily interested. Against this Hume\nobserves that judgments of taste are necessarily disinterested only in\nthe sense that they are necessarily non-self-interested, and that I\nmight therefore judge a chair to be beautiful on the basis of its\nbeing useful to someone, though not on the basis that it is useful to\nme (Hume 1739\u201340 [1987, 363\u2013365]).\n\nHume follows Hutcheson in regarding the idea of beauty as analogous to\na Lockean secondary quality, and so follows Hutcheson in holding\nbeauty to be subjective, having no existence outside of the mind that\ncontemplates it (Hume 1757 [1987, 230]). But Hume reckons more directly\nthan Hutcheson does with the price such a subjectivism exacts, namely,\nits apparent inconsistency with our practice of counting some\njudgments of beauty as correct and others as incorrect. This reckoning\nstarts with the observation that the subjectivity of colors is no\nbarrier to our counting some color judgments correct and some\nincorrect. Anyone who has the idea of redness can recognize the\nconditions under which we count an object as veridically manifesting\nredness, namely, \u201cits appearance in day-light to the eye of a\nman in health\u201d (Hume 1757 [1987, 233\u2013234]). Similarly, Hume holds\nthat anyone with the idea of beauty can recognize the conditions under\nwhich we count an object as veridically manifesting beauty (Hume\n1757 [1987, 233\u2013234]). These conditions are the appearance of beauty to\nthose (1) whose taste is delicate (Hume 1757 [1987, 234\u2013237]), (2) who\nhave practiced (Hume 1757 [1987, 237\u2013238]), (3) who have made certain\ncomparisons (Hume 1757 [1987, 238]), (4) who lack prejudice (Hume\n1757 [1987, 239\u2013240]), and (5) whose understanding is sound (Hume\n1757 [1987, 240\u2013241]). Conditions (1), (2), and (5) are evidently\nsupposed to guarantee that the object is grasped as having all and\nonly the aesthetically relevant properties it has, whereas conditions\n(3) and (4) are evidently supposed to guarantee that a properly\ncalibrated sentiment arises from the object as grasped. In sum, we\ntake an object\u2019s beauty to appear as it is, according to Hume,\nwhen and only when the right sentiment arises from the object rightly\ngrasped.\n",
