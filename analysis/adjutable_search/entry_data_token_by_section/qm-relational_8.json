    "main_text": "General Comments || Realism and Relationality\n3.1 Realism and Relationality\n\nThe central move of RQM is to interpret all physical variables as\nrelational, namely as referring to two systems, not a single one, and\nto view them as realised only in interactions. Relationality has been\nplaying an ever dominant role as our knowledge of the natural world\nhas increased. Examples are the relational nature of velocity in\nclassical mechanics, of locality in general relativity, of the\npotential in electromagnetism, of the gauge invariant observables in\nnon-abelian gauge theories, and many others. RQM is a step further in\nthis direction. Taken seriously, the philosophical implications of\nthis overreaching relationally can be heavy. The main one is a\nweakening of a strong version of realism.\n\nIf by realism we mean the assumption that the world is \u201cout\nthere\u201d, irrespectively of our mental states, or perceptions,\nthere is nothing in RQM that contradicts realism. But if by realism we\nmean the stronger assumption that each variables of each subsystem of\nthe world has a single value at each and every time, then this strong\nversion of realism is weakened by RQM. The ontology of RQM is a sparse\n(\u201cflash\u201d) ontology of relational quantum events, taken as\nprimitive, and not derived from any \u201cunderlying\u201d\nrepresentation.\n\nThis weakening of realism is in a direction similar to what happened\nwith Galilean or Einstein\u2019s relativity, which have shown that\nthere is no fact of the matter in the velocity of a single object, or\nin the simultaneity of two space like separated events alone. But is a\nmore radical step in this direction. In Laudisa (2019) it is pointed\nout that RQM gives no deeper justification or underlying dynamical\nrepresentation of the main process: the actualisation of quantum\nevents at interactions. This is the process which in textbook quantum\ntheory is called measurement and is accompanied by state reduction.\nQuantum mechanics gives probabilities for quantum events to happen,\nnot a story representing how they happen. This core aspect of quantum\ntheory is not resolved in RQM: it is taken as a fact of the world.\nWhat RQM does resolve is the question of when this happens: any time\none system affects another one, it happens relative to this other\nsystem. What RQM does, is to show that this is not in contradiction\nwith the existence of interference effects. But the core discreteness\nof the quantum event actualisation is not \u201cexplained\u201d in\nRQM: it is understood as the picture of how nature works according to\nquantum theory.\n\nThe weakening of realism is the \u201cprice to pay\u201d for the\nrelational interpretation of quantum mechanics. It can be compared\nwith the \u201cprice to pay\u201d in other interpretations, such as\nthe inflated ontology and the distance between the ontology and the\nworld as we see it of the Many Worlds interpretation, the existence of\nvariables unobservables in principle and the loss of Lorentz\ninvariance of Bohm theory, and so on.\n\nThe other side of the coin of each \u201cprice to pay\u201d is the\nlesson we might gather from the empirical success of quantum theory:\nfor the Many Worlds interpretation, for instance, the lesson is the\nreal existence of other branches, for Bohm theory is the real\nexistence of unobservable variables that pick a preferred reference\nframe, and so on. For RQM, the lesson of quantum theory is that the\ndescription of the way distinct physical systems affect each other\nwhen they interact (and not the way physical systems\n\u2018are\u2019) exhausts all that can be said about the physical\nworld. The physical world must be described as a net of interacting\ncomponents, where there is no meaning to \u2018the state of an\nisolated system\u2019, or the value of the variables of an isolated\nsystem. The state of a physical system is the net of the relations it\nentertains with the surrounding systems. The physical structure of the\nworld is identified as this net of relationships. The notion of\nsubstance that plays a major role in western philosophy might be\ninappropriate to account for this science; perhaps the idea of a\n\u201cmutual dependency\u201d [N\u0101g\u0101rjuna 1995] may offer a\nrelevant philosophical cadre.\n",
