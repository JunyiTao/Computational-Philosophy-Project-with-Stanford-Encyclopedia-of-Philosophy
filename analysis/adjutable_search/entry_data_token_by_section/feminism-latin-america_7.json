    "main_text": "Key Issues and Debates || Gender in Hemispheric Context\n2.3 Gender in Hemispheric Context\n\nAnother key debate that has emerged as a part of the broader Latin\nAmerican feminist conversation on the politics of translation has been\nover the use of the term gender, which, as previously noted,\nentered the hemispheric frame with the translation of Gayle\nRubin\u2019s scholarship into Spanish. The term was translated into\nSpanish as g\u00e9nero, whose direct translation is more\nakin to \u201cgenre\u201d or \u201cspecies\u201d. Latin American\nfeminists have contested the legitimacy of gender as a\ncategory of feminist analysis (Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010:\n403).\n\nPrior to the introduction of the term gender, feminists most\nreadily used the concept of patriarchy because it offered a\nframework grounded in ideological and socioeconomic conditions that\nallowed for articulating the cause of women\u2019s oppression\n(Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010: 403). In many ways,\npatriarchy served as a glue of consciousness-raising in late\n20th century women\u2019s movements of Latin America,\nhelping connect women by identifying their shared subordinate status\nunder conditions of patriarchy.\n\nDuring the Second Encuentro in 1982 (Lima, Per\u00fa)\npatriarchy was declared the foundational category from which\nLatin American feminists sought to understand their realities. It was\ndeployed as an explanation for the subordination of women, but also\nextended as an explanation for the conditions of compulsory\nheterosexuality, repression, violence against women and children, the\nprohibition of abortion, and varying forms of social injustice\n(Gargallo 2004: 92). It was further linked into frameworks that sought\nto identify the role of militarization and capitalism in the\noppression of women. Hence, it provided a methodological frame from\nwhich to articulate claims about power, oppression, and domination\nthat united women on many fronts. Patriarchy was a conceptual\nstronghold of Latin American feminism akin to what imperialism was to\nnational liberation struggles (Gargallo 2004: 92). It was\nexplanatorily powerful because it could account for complex realities\nwhile also providing an explanation for the shared experiences of\nwomen. Unfortunately, the explanatory power of the term was so\nexpansive that it rendered historical specificities opaque since\nnothing could exist at its margins (Gargallo 2004: 92).\n\nReplacing the focus on patriarchy, the gender\nperspective (\u201cperspectiva de g\u00e9nero\u201d) or\ngender focus (\u201cenfoque de g\u00e9nero\u201d) became\nthe methodological framework from which to talk about women and\nwomen\u2019s issues across Latin America. Woman was replaced\nas a foundational category by gender, which became a blanket\nterm so user-friendly that anyone could use it as a referent to\nwomen\u2019s issues (Schutte & Femen\u00edas 2010: 404). The\nease with which it was used entailed the softening of radical militant\ncritiques of patriarchy that had characterized feminist\ntheorization in earlier decades. Gender was incorporated into\npublic policy and social programs by state and intergovernmental\norganizations, reflecting the way in which it could be taken up as\npart of the lexicon for even policies not feminist-inspired (Lima\nCosta 2014a: 26). On the flip side, the Vatican during its preparation\nfor the 1995 Conference on Women feared using the word gender\nas it might entail the acceptance of homosexuality, the destruction of\nthe patriarchal family, and the dissemination of feminism (Lima Costa\n2014a: 28).\n\nAlthough the movement of gender across hemispheres is far\nfrom complete, it is important to recognize the way in which the\ntraffic of gender took place in and through material\nconditions. One notable method of translating and migrating concepts\nis through academic journals, and the debates on the uses of\ngender have revealed broader reflections on how concepts come\nto carry epistemic weight. The transnational citational market is one\nkey dimension in this process as who gets cited, where, and by whom\nexposes the routes through which theories have traveled in global\ncontexts (Lima Costa 2014b: 142). In light of the conceptual travel\nand use of gender, Latin American feminisms ask that one\nconsider the way in which the global privileging of English as the\nlinguistic medium impacts what knowledge is allowed to circulate (Lima\nCosta 2014b: 142). Moreover, these reflections bring to the fore the\nfact that English cannot be viewed as a transparent medium as its\nprivileged status sets the stage for what gets taken up as worth\ntranslating in the first place. It should then be no surprise that\ngender has traveled so far. Its traffic is a marker of the\nimperative to create conditions for productive\n\u201cmis-translations\u201d that create spaces for heterogeneous\nconceptual development (Lima Costa 2014b: 144).\n",
