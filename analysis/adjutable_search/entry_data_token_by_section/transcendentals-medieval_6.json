    "main_text": "Three Models of the Transcendentals: Thomas Aquinas, Henry of Ghent and Eckhart, and John Duns Scotus || The third model: being as univocally common to God and creature (Duns Scotus)\n4.3 The third model: being as univocally common to God and creature (Duns Scotus)\n\n\nDuns Scotus (ca. 1266\u20131308) identifies the subject of metaphysics\nwith the first object of the intellect; since \u201call things\nnaturally knowable of God are transcendental,\u201d metaphysics\nincludes a consideration of the divine. Scotus formulates a new\nconception of transcendentality, according to which a transcendental\nhas no predicate above it except being. The consequence is that a\ntranscendental is not necessarily common: \u201cTherefore, it belongs\nto the meaning of \u2018transcendental\u2019 to have no predicate\nabove it but \u2018being\u2019; however, that it be common to many\ninferiors, is\n inessential.\u201d[4]\nThus, the range of the transcendental is extended.\nApart from the common notions, therefore, that are simply convertible\nwith the concept of \u2018being\u2019, like \u2018the one\u2019,\n\u2018the true\u2019, and \u2018the good\u2019, Duns Scotus admits\ndisjunctive transcendentals, i.e. transcendentals that are\ndisjunctively convertible with the concept of \u2018being\u2019, like\n\u2018infinite\u2019-\u2018finite\u2019,\n\u2018act\u2019-\u2018potency\u2019, etc. Finally, he also includes\n\u2018pure perfections\u2019, like \u2018wisdom\u2019, in the class\nof transcendentals and even claims that all transcendentals are called\n\u2018pure perfections\u2019 (perfectiones\nsimpliciter). The concept of being is a quidditative notion\nthat indicates the aptitude to exist and that is univocally predicated\nof God and creature, without \u2013 and this is the major innovation\nhere \u2013 positing a reality common to them. Between\n\u2018being\u2019 and the convertible transcendentals, like\n\u2018the one\u2019, there is a so-called formal\ndistinction: without being different things from being, \u2018the\none\u2019, \u2018the true\u2019, and \u2018the good\u2019 are\ndistinct from being and from each other by a different formality.\nBetween \u2018being\u2019 and the disjunctive transcendental\n properties, there is a modal distinction.[5]\nScotus applies the theory of the\n\u2018intension and remission of forms\u2019 to the transcendentals\n(which introduces degrees of perfection in the transcendentals); hence,\nthe common concept of \u2018being\u2019 and the proper concept of\n\u2018infinite being\u2019 are distinguished as a reality and its\nproper and intrinsic mode. (See Wolter 1946 & Dumont 1992.)\n\n\nThe Scotist school in the early fourteenth century discusses and\nextends Scotus\u2019 major innovations: the new conception of\ntranscendentality, which separates transcendentality from commonness\nand leads to the introduction of \u2018degrees of\ntranscendentality\u2019, the univocity of being, and the explanation\nof the non-identity of the transcendentals by a distinction that is not\nmerely conceptual.\n",
