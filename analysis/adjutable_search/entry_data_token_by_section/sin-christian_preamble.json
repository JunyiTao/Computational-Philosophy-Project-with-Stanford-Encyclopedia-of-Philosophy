    "main_text": "\n\nWhile some have sought to give naturalistic accounts of sin (see Ruse\n2002), this entry treats sin as a religious concept. Sin plays a\ncentral role in many of the world\u2019s major religions (see Graham\n2007), and this role is arguably its central connotation (see M. Adams\n1991). A full treatment of sin as a topic in the philosophy of\nreligion would therefore need to canvass a wide array of religious\ntraditions, such as Judaism and Islam (Watt 2009 and McGinnis 2018).\nSince Christianity develops out of Judaism, a historical discussion of\nChristian understandings of sin would also need to pay careful\nattention to sin as understood in Judaism BCE (see Anderson 2009, Katz\n2006, Graves 2016, and Bashevkin 2019). The present article focuses\nspecifically on treatments of sin within the contemporary Christian\nanalytic theological tradition.\n\nEven limited just to the contemporary Christian tradition,\n\u201csin\u201d denotes a broad category which can be subcategorized\nin a number of ways. One could, for instance, classify sins in terms\nof offenses against different individuals or groups, as when one\ndistinguishes between sins against God, sins against others, and sins\nagainst oneself (see Sweeney 2018: 351; for other subcategorizations\nof sin in these terms, see Couenhoven 2013 and McCall 2019: chapter\n5). One could also differentiate between the moral wrong that has been\ndone by an act of sin (sometimes called \u201cthe problem of past\nsin\u201d), and the moral wrong or sin that one is likely to do\n(sometimes called \u201cthe problem of future sin\u201d; see Stump\n1988: 64). Future sins can be further divided between moral wrongs\nthat one is likely to do in virtue of one\u2019s personal\ninclinations or dispositions, and moral wrongs that one is likely to\ndo in virtue of possessing a fallen or sinful human nature. The\npresent article will explore sin as an action\n (section 2),\n sin as a disposition or vice\n (section 3)\n and sin as a state or \u201cthe condition of being in\nsin\u201d\n (section 4;\n see Plantinga 2000: 207).\n\nIt is important to note that commitment to one of these three\ncategories of sin does not entail a commitment to either or both of\nthe others; a commitment to the existence of sinful acts, for\ninstance, does not entail a commitment to sinful dispositions or\nvices. There are some in the Christian tradition who think that being\nvicious doesn\u2019t entail being sinful (e.g., William of Ockham;\nsee Sweeney 2018). Furthermore, one can affirm the existence of both\nsinful actions and sinful dispositions without being committed to the\nexistence of sin as a state of being, that is, without being committed\nto the doctrine of original sin. Immanuel Kant, for instance, affirms\nthe two former categories while rejecting the latter (Kant\nReligion Within the Limits of Reason Alone [1793]; see also\nQuinn 1990). In addition to considering sin as action, disposition,\nand state, the present article also addresses the noetic effects of\nsin\n (section 5)\n and the idea of structural sin\n (section 6),\n according to which sin can be embedded in the structures of various\nsocial systems.\n",
