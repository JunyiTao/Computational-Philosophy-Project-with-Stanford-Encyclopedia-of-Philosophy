    "main_text": "Fine-Tuning and Design || An Alternative Argument from Fine-Tuning for Design\n3.5 An Alternative Argument from Fine-Tuning for Design\n\nThe argument from fine-tuning for design as reviewed in\n Section 3.1\n treats the fact that life requires fine-tuned conditions as\nbackground knowledge and assesses the evidential significance of the\nobservation that life-friendly conditions obtain against that\nbackground. An alternative argument from fine-tuning for design,\nexplored by John Roberts (2012) and independently investigated and\nendorsed by Roger White (2011) in a reply to Weisberg (2010), treats\nour knowledge that the conditions are right for life as background\ninformation and assesses the rational impact of physicists\u2019\ninsight that life requires fine-tuned conditions against this\nbackground. An advantage of this alternative is that it fits better\nwith our actual epistemic situation: that the conditions are right for\nlife is something we have known for a long time; our actual new\nevidence is that the laws of physics\u2014as White (2011) and\nWeisberg (2012) put it\u2014are stringent rather than\nlax in the constraints that they impose on the constants and\nboundary conditions if there is to be life.\n\nThe central likelihood inequality around which White\u2019s version\nof the argument revolves is  \n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(S\\mid D,O) > P(S\\mid \\neg D,O)\\,,\n\\label{alternative}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \u201c\\(D\\)\u201d is, again, the designer hypothesis,\n\u201c\\(S\\)\u201d is the proposition that the laws are stringent\n(i.e., that life requires delicate fine-tuning of the constants) and\n\u201c\\(O\\)\u201d is our background knowledge that life exists\n(White 2011: 678). (See Roberts [2012: 296] for an assumption that\nplays an analogous role as \\(\\eqref{alternative}\\).) The inequality\n\\(\\eqref{alternative}\\) expresses the statement that stringent laws\nconfirm the designer hypothesis, given our background knowledge that\nlife exists. Does it plausibly hold for reasonable probability\nassignments? White argues that it does and supports this claim by\ngiving a rigorous derivation of \\(\\eqref{alternative}\\) from\nassumptions that he regards as plausible. Crucial among them is the\ninequality  \n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\nP(D\\mid S) \\ge P(D\\mid \\neg S)\\,,\n\\label{alternative1}\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\n\n\nwhich White motivates by arguing that \u201cthe fact that the laws\nput stringent conditions on life does not by itself provide any\nevidence against design\u201d (White 2011: 678). Put\ndifferently, according to White, absent information that life exists,\ninformation that the laws are stringent does at least not speak\nagainst the existence of a designer.\n\nWeisberg (2012) criticizes \\(\\eqref{alternative1}\\)\u2014and takes\nhis criticism to undermine \\(\\eqref{alternative}\\)\u2014arguing that\nit is implausible by the design theorist\u2019s own standards. The\ndesign theorist holds a combination of views according to which, on\nthe one hand, life is more probable if there is a designer than if\nthere is no designer and life is less probable if the laws are\nstringent rather than lax. If one adds to this combination of views\nthe assumption that none of the possible life-friendly conditions has\nhigher probability than the others, both if there is a designer and if\nthere is no designer, it dictates that\u2014bracketing knowledge that\nlife exists\u2014stringent laws speak against the existence\nof a designer, i.e., it dictates \\(P(D\\mid S) < P(D\\mid \\neg S)\\),\ncontrary to \\(\\eqref{alternative1}\\). Absent any evidence that life\nexists, evidence that the laws are stringent speaks against the\nexistence of life in that stringent laws make life unexpected.\n\nA possible response for the design theorist, anticipated by Weisberg\n(2012: 713), would be to support \\(\\eqref{alternative1}\\) by arguing\nthat the designer would plausibly first choose either\nstringent or lax laws, sidestepping her intention to enable the\nexistence of life at that stage or actively preferring stringent laws,\nand only then choosing life-friendly constants. A problem\nwith this response, similar to the difficulties discussed in\n Section 3.4,\n is that we have little experience with cosmic designers and,\ntherefore, difficulties to predict the hypothesized designer\u2019s\npreferences and likely actions.\n",
