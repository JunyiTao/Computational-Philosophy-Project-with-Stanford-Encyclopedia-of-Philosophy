    "main_text": "What is Sport? || Conventionalism\n2.2 Conventionalism\n\n\nConventionalism attempts to address the limitations of formalism by\nrecognizing the normative significance of unwritten rules of the game.\nFor conventionalists, rules do not exhaust the sources of normative\nreasons within sport. Conventionalists argue that rules (whether\nconstitutive or regulative) cannot determine their own application and\nthey fail to provide guidance for all possible eventualities in a game\n(e.g. situations that were not envisioned by the rule makers). In\naddition, a strictly rule-centric approach fails to account for the\nexistence of unwritten norms that supplement the rules. Such norms\nexist independent of, and sometimes in conflict with, the formal\nrules.\n\n\nConventionalists argue that an adequate account of sport must appeal\nto collectively agreed-upon norms called \u2018conventions.\u2019\nFred D\u2019Agostino, the pioneer of conventionalism, maintains that the\nconventions that operate within a game constitute the\n\u2018ethos\u2019 of the game. The ethos of a game is the \u2018set\nof unofficial, implicit conventions which determine how the rules of a\ngame are to be applied in concrete circumstances\u2019\n(D\u2019Agostino, 1981, 15). Thus, from a conventionalist perspective,\nsports comprise both formal rules and conventions. For example, in\nsoccer, convention dictates that the ball must be put out of play when\nany player requires medical attention. No written rule demands that\nplayers kick the ball out of play in such circumstances. However, any\nplayer who failed to do so would be subject to blame and rebuke.\nConventionalism is better equipped than formalism to describe and\nunderstand how sports are actually practiced in specific contexts. For\ninstance, despite playing the same game, amateur soccer players in a\npick-up game and professional players in the World Cup final apply the\nrulebook differently (e.g. amateurs often suspend the offside rule,\nwhereas the rule is crucial at the professional level). Likewise, the\nnon-contact and travelling rules in basketball are applied differently\ndepending on the context.\n\n\nCritics acknowledge that conventionalism is a fruitful descriptive\ntheory of sport, but point out that its normative implications are\nproblematic (Ciomaga, 2013). For instance, much as formalism lacks the\nresources to distinguish good from bad rules, it has been objected that\nconventionalism too lacks \u2018critical edge,\u2019 for it fails to\nprovide the resources necessary to distinguish good from bad\nconventions (Simon et al., 2015). That a convention in fact operates in\na sport does not settle the question of whether it should operate. In\nshort, conventionalists seem to take the status quo as normative. An\nimplication of conventionalism would seem to be, then, that manifestly\nobjectionable conventions (e.g. \u2018never pass the ball to a black\nperson\u2019 or \u2018spit at members of the opposing team whenever\npossible\u2019) could be normative on a conventionalist scheme.\n\n\nDrawing on David Lewis\u2019 and Andrei Marmor\u2019s work on conventions,\nconventionalists have attempted to address this objection by\ndistinguishing \u2018deep\u2019 from \u2018surface\u2019\nconventions (Morgan, 2012). This view is called \u2018deep\nconventionalism\u2019. Surface conventions are what Lewis called\n\u2018coordinating\u2019 conventions. Their main function is to help individuals\nto resolve recurrent, collective problems. For instance, Morgan argues\nthat, when participating in a game, players may encounter situations\nthat require collective decisionmaking related to the application of a\nspecific rule or an event that disrupts the flow of the game. To solve\nthese problems, participants harmonize their action by agreeing to\nuphold the same unwritten rules.\n\n\nDeep conventions do not relate to problem solving and coordination.\nRather, they are \u2018normative responses to deep psychological and social\nneeds for playing sports\u2019 (Morgan, 2015, 39). Put differently, deep\nconventions shape sports into the various historical and social forms\nthey have taken. For instance, the principles and ideals underlying the\namateur view of sport, according to which participants engage in the\ngame chiefly for the love of it, are deep conventions. Thus, a\nsport\u2019s deep conventions determine the point of that sport and\nprovide a rationale for playing the sport in a specific way by\nestablishing what counts as normatively intelligible and justifiable\nwithin that sport. For example, amateur athletes often view sport as a\nperfective enterprise pursued for its own sake. They play sport for the\nlove of the game not for instrumental benefit. The amateur\u2019s\nemphasis on the intrinsic value of sport contrasts with the\nprofessional\u2019s view of sport. For professionals, sport tends to\nbe viewed as a serious, instrumental occupation, that is, a means to\nearn a living (Morgan, 2015, 40\u201341). Thus, amateurs and professionals\nevaluate differently practices such as training, doping, and\nstrategising. While professionals embrace conduct that increases their\nchance of victory, amateurs are often more discerning, rejecting\npractices such as professional coaches and strategic fouling on the\ngrounds that they are detrimental to the emphasis of the appreciation\nof the practice itself, not the instrumental goals achieved through it.\n \n\n\nIn response to critics of conventionalism, Morgan has argued that\ndeep conventions provide evaluative criteria by which the moral\nstanding of surface conventions can be assessed. However, it remains\nunclear whether Morgan responds satisfactorily to criticisms that have\nbeen leveled against deep conventionalism (Moore, 2018). How can deep\nconventions be distinguished from surface conventions? Does deep\nconventionalism only shift the \u2018critical edge\u2019 problem to\nthe deep convention level? What resources does deep conventionalism\nprovide to evaluate deep conventions? \n",
