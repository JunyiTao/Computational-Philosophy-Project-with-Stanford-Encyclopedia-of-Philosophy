    "main_text": "Aesthetic Experience || Subjective side\n3.1 Subjective side\n\n\nOrdinary cognition, according to Schopenhauer, is bound up with the\nindividual\u2019s will, that is to say, with one\u2019s generally\negoistic strivings, and is subordinate to the four forms of the\n\u201cprinciple of sufficient reason\u201d (PSR), the principle which\nholds that nothing is without a reason for why it is (FR, \u00a75). The\nPSR is Schopenhauer\u2019s formulation of the ways in which human\nbeings cognitively condition the world of representation. It includes\nspace, time and causality, as well as psychological, logical and\nmathematical forms of explanation. \n\n\nBy contrast, aesthetic experience consists in the subject\u2019s\nachieving will-less [willenlos] perception of the\nworld. In order for the subject to attain such perception, her\nintellect must cease viewing things in the ordinary\nway\u2014relationally and ultimately in relation to one\u2019s\nwill\u2014she must \u201cstop considering the Where, When, Why and\nWherefore of things but simply and exclusively consider the\nWhat\u201d (WWR I, 201).  In other words, will-less\nperception is perception of objects simply for the understanding of\nwhat they are essentially, in and for themselves, and without regard to\nthe actual or possible relationships those phenomenal objects have to\nthe striving self. \n\n\nSchopenhauer characterizes the subject who has aesthetic experience as\nthe \u201cpure subject of cognition.\u201d It is \u201cpure\u201d\nin the sense that the subject\u2019s intellect is not operating in\nthe service of the will to life during aesthetic experience, though\nthis subject is still embodied\u2014for without embodiment,\nwithout the senses, a subject would not perceive at all (WWR I,\n198). Thus, while the pure subject of cognition is free temporarily\nfrom the service of the individual will, it is nonetheless still\nidentical with the embodied subject of willing. The freedom of the\nintellect from the service to the individual will constitutes a sort\nof acting \u2018out of character\u2019. Exactly how the intellect\ncan cease to serve the individual will remains murky, however. (More on\nthis at 4.5; for a detailed account of role\nof freedom in Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory, see Neill and\nShapshay 2012.)\n\n\nSimilar to the notion of disinterested pleasure in Kant, in\nSchopenhauer\u2019s aesthetics the subjective side of aesthetic\nexperience involves the will-less pleasure of tranquility. The\nexperience of aesthetic tranquility stands in stark contrast with\nordinary willing. All willing, according to Schopenhauer, involves\nsuffering, insofar as it originates from need and\ndeficiency.   Satisfaction, when it is achieved affords a\nfleeting joy and yields fairly quickly to painful boredom, which is\ntantamount to a deficiency, and which starts the entire process anew.\n Given this grim account of willing, it is not surprising that\nSchopenhauer describes aesthetic experience in truly rapturous terms as\n\u201cthe painless state that Epicurus prized as the highest good and\nthe state of the gods,\u201d and as \u201cthe Sabbath of the penal\nservitude of willing\u201d when the \u201cwheel of Ixion stands\nstill\u201d (WWR I, 220).\n",
