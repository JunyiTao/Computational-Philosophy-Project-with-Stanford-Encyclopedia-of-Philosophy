    "main_text": "\n\nAccording to the coherence theory of justification, also known as\ncoherentism, a belief or set of beliefs is justified, or justifiably\nheld, just in case the belief coheres with a set of beliefs, the set\nforms a coherent system or some variation on these themes. The\ncoherence theory of justification should be distinguished from the\ncoherence theory of truth. The former is a theory of what it\nmeans for a belief or a set of beliefs to be justified, or for a\nsubject to be justified in holding the belief or set of beliefs. The\nlatter is a theory of what it means for a belief or proposition to be\ntrue. Modern coherence theorists, in contrast to some earlier writers\nin the British idealist tradition, typically subscribe to a coherence\ntheory of justification without advocating a coherence theory of\ntruth. Rather, they either favor a correspondence theory of truth or\ntake the notion of truth for granted, at least for the purposes of\ntheir epistemological investigations. This does not prevent many\nauthors from claiming that coherence justification is an indication or\ncriterion of truth.\n",
