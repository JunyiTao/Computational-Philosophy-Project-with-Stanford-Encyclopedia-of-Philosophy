    "main_text": "Models of Disability || An Affirmative Model?\n1.2 An Affirmative Model?\n\nThe debate between the medical and social model about the source of\nthe disadvantages disabled people experience has dominated academic\ndiscourse about disability since the 1970s. More recently, however,\ndisability activists and disabled scholars have questioned the\napparent shared assumption of both models, that disability is\nfundamentally a matter of disadvantage, exclusion, or functional\nlimitation. This to take a (partly) different view on what an account\nof disability should explain; a view consistent in principle with\neither a more medical or more social view of what does the explaining.\nThe affirmative model of disability and impairment, as\narticulated by John Swain and Sally French (2000), holds that\ndisability is not in the first instance a problem\u2014not simply or\nsolely a \u201cpersonal tragedy\u201d, and implicitly, not simply or\nsolely a social injustice either. Rather, disability is a different\nway of living in and experiencing the world, one not characterized by\nits disadvantages any more than its advantages.\n\nNote that this is not a claim about what causally explains disability;\nrather, it is a claim about what aspects of the phenomena of\ndisability should serve as the object of explanation in social\nscientific theories of disability. As such, the affirmational model is\nprima facie consistent with either the medical or the social\nmodel, and indeed tends to draw on considerations from both. The\ndiverse mix of advantages and disadvantages that characterize life\nwith disability can derive from biological factors, social factors, or\ninteractions between the two. On the side of advantage, a person with\na disability like blindness might celebrate the increased attention\nsightlessness saves for hearing and other senses as well as the\nsolidarity they experience with other disabled people as they fight\ntogether against ableism and for social justice. On the side of\ndisadvantage, the affirmational model will point to the considerations\nsome would regard as personal tragedies as, instead, a combination of\npurely functional challenges to be overcome, and conditions of social\nexclusion that can make life harder without thereby making it any less\nvaluable or worth living.\n\nStill: though logically independent of claims about the evaluative\nimport of disability, the medical and social models suggest different\nviews about the impact of disability on well-being, and different\nviews about how disability is relevant to reproductive decisions,\nmedical interventions, and social policy. The affirmational model is\nlikely to be more in sympathy with social than medical models here.\nThose who accept a social model of disability regard the association\nbetween disability and well-being as highly contingent, mediated by a\nvariety of environmental and social factors (Campbell & Stramondo\n2017). They also tend to question conceptions of well-being that give\na central role to the possession or exercise of the standard array of\nphysical and mental functions, as those conceptions imply, or are\noften taken to imply, that well-being is precluded or diminished\nmerely by the absence or limitation of those functions (see entry\n disability: health, well-being, and personal relationships).\n As a result, they generally see the disadvantages of disability not\nonly as externally caused, but as less formidable than they appear to\npeople who view disability in largely biomedical terms. These\ndifferences are reflected in the conflicting assessments of life with\ndisabilities found in the bioethics and public policy literature on\nthe one hand, and disability scholarship on the other (contrast Brock\n2005 with Goering 2008).\n",
