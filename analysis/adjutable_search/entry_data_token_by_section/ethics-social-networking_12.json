    "main_text": "Contemporary Ethical Concerns about Social Networking Services || Social Networking Services and Cybercrime\n4. Social Networking Services and Metaethical Issues\n\nA host of metaethical questions are raised by the rapid emergence of\nSNS. For example, SNS lend new data to an earlier philosophical debate\n(Tavani 2005; Moor 2008) about whether classical ethical traditions\nsuch as utilitarianism, Kantian ethics or virtue ethics possess\nsufficient resources for illuminating the implications of emerging\n information technology for moral values,\n or whether we require a new ethical framework to handle such\nphenomena. Charles Ess (2006, 2021) has suggested that a new,\npluralistic \u201cglobal information ethics\u201d may be the\nappropriate context from which to view novel information technologies.\nOther scholars have suggested that technologies such as SNS invite\nrenewed attention to existing ethical approaches such as\n pragmatism\n (van den Eede 2010),\n virtue ethics\n (Vallor 2016)\n feminist or care ethics\n (Hamington 2010; Puotinen 2011) that have often been neglected by\napplied ethicists in favor of conventional utilitarian and\ndeontological resources.\n\nA related metaethical project relevant to SNS is the development of an\nexplicitly intercultural information ethics (Ess 2005a;\nCapurro 2008; Honglaradom and Britz 2010). SNS and other emerging\ninformation technologies do not reliably confine themselves to\nnational or cultural boundaries, and this creates a particular\nchallenge for applied ethicists. For example, SNS practices in\ndifferent countries must be analyzed against a conceptual background\nthat recognizes and accommodates complex differences in moral norms\nand practices (Capurro 2005; Hongladarom 2007, Wong 2013). SNS\nphenomena that one might expect to benefit from intercultural analysis\ninclude: varied cultural patterns and preference/tolerance for\naffective display, argument and debate, personal exposure, expressions\nof political, interfamilial or cultural criticism, religious\nexpression and sharing of intellectual property. Alternatively, the\nvery possibility of a coherent information ethics may come under\nchallenge, for example, from a\n constructivist\n view that emerging socio-technological practices like SNS continually\nredefine ethical norms\u2014such that our analyses of SNS\nand related technologies are not only doomed to operate from shifting\nground, but from ground that is being shifted by the intended\nobject of our ethical analysis.\n\nFinally, there are pressing practical concerns about whether and how\nphilosophers can actually have an impact on the ethical profile of\nemerging technologies such as SNS. If philosophers direct their\nethical analyses only to other philosophers, then such analyses may\nfunction simply as ethical postmortems of human-technology relations,\nwith no opportunity to actually pre-empt, reform or redirect unethical\ntechnological practices. But to whom else can, or should, these\nethical concerns be directed: SNS users? Regulatory bodies and\npolitical institutions? SNS software developers? How can the\ntheoretical content and practical import of these analyses be made\naccessible to these varied audiences? What motivating force are they\nlikely to have?\n\nThese questions have become particularly acute of late with the\ncontroversy over alleged corporate capture by technology companies of\nthe language of ethics, and associated charges of\n\u2018ethics-washing\u2019 (Green 2021 [Other Internet Resources],\nBietti 2020). Some argue that ethics is the wrong tool to fight the\nharms of emerging technologies and large technology platforms (Hao\n2021); yet alternative proposals to focus on justice, rights, harms,\nequity or the legitimate use of power unwittingly fall right back\nwithin the normative scope of ethics. Unless we resort to a cynical\nframe of \u2018might makes right,\u2019 there is no escaping the\nneed to use ethics to distinguish the relationships with\nsociotechnical phenomena and powers that we regard as permissible,\ngood, or right, from those that should be resisted and dismantled.\n\nThe profound urgency of this task becomes apparent once we recognize\nthat unlike those \u2018life or death\u2019 ethical dilemmas with\nwhich many applied ethicists are understandably often preoccupied\n(e.g., abortion, euthanasia and capital punishment), emerging\ninformation technologies such as SNS have in a very short time worked\nthemselves into the daily moral fabric of virtually all of our lives,\ntransforming the social landscape and the moral habits and\npractices with which we navigate it. The ethical concerns illuminated\nhere are, in a very real sense, anything but \u2018academic,\u2019\nand neither philosophers nor the broader human community can afford\nthe luxury of treating them as such.\n",
