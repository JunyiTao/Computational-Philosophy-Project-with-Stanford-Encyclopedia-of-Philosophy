    "main_text": "The Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem || Probabilistic Independence\n4.2 Probabilistic Independence\n\nIn most scientific contexts the outcomes in a stream of experiments or\nobservations are probabilistically independent of one another\nrelative to each hypothesis under consideration, or can at least be\ndivided up into probabilistically independent parts. For our purposes\nprobabilistic independence of evidential outcomes on a\nhypothesis divides neatly into two types.\n\n\nDefinition: Independent Evidence Conditions:\n\n A sequence of outcomes \\(e^k\\) is\ncondition-independent of a condition for an\nadditional experiment or observation \\(c_{k+1}\\), given \\(h\\cdot b\\)\ntogether with its own conditions \\(c^k\\), if and only if\n\n\\[\nP[e^k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c^{k }\\cdot c_{ k+1}]  = P[e^k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c^k] .\n\\]\n\n \n An individual outcome \\(e_k\\) is \nresult-independent of a sequence of other observations and\ntheir outcomes \\((c^{k-1}\\cdot e^{k-1})\\), given \\(h\\cdot b\\) and its\nown condition \\(c_k\\), if and only if \n\n\\[\nP[e_k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c_k\\cdot(c^{k-1 }\\cdot e^{ k-1})]  = P[e_k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c_k] .\n  \\]\n\n \n\n\n\nWhen these two conditions hold, the likelihood for an evidence\nsequence may be decomposed into the product of the likelihoods for\nindividual experiments or observations. To see how the two\nindependence conditions affect the decomposition, first\nconsider the following formula, which holds even when neither\nindependence condition is satisfied: \n\n\\[\\tag{12}\n    P[e^n \\pmid  h_{j }\\cdot b\\cdot c^{ n}] =  \n\\prod^{n}_{k = 1}\n    P[e_k \\pmid  h_{j }\\cdot b\\cdot c^n\\cdot e^{ k-1}] .  \n\\]\n\n\nWhen condition-independence holds, the likelihood of the\nwhole evidence stream parses into a product of likelihoods that\nprobabilistically depend on only past observation conditions\nand their outcomes. They do not depend on the conditions for other\nexperiments whose outcomes are not yet specified. Here is the\nformula: \n\n\\[\\tag{13}\n    P[e^n \\pmid  h_{j }\\cdot b\\cdot c^{ n}] =  \n \\prod^{n}_{k = 1}\n    P[e_k \\pmid  h_{j }\\cdot b\\cdot c_k\\cdot (c^{k-1}\\cdot e^{ k-1})] .  \n\\]\n\n\nFinally, whenever both independence conditions are satisfied\nwe have the following relationship between the likelihood of the\nevidence stream and the likelihoods of individual experiments or\nobservations: \n\n\\[\\tag{14}\n    P[e^n \\pmid  h_{j }\\cdot b\\cdot c^{ n}] =  \n\\prod^{n}_{k = 1}\n    P[e_k \\pmid  h_{j }\\cdot b\\cdot c_{ k}] .  \n\\]\n\n\n(For proofs of Equations 12\u201314 see the supplement\n Immediate Consequences of Independent Evidence Conditions.)\n\nIn scientific contexts the evidence can almost always be divided into\nparts that satisfy both clauses of the Independent Evidence\nCondition with respect to each alternative hypothesis. To see\nwhy, let us consider each independence condition more carefully.\n\nCondition-independence says that the mere addition of a new\nobservation condition \\(c_{k+1}\\), without specifying one of its\noutcomes, does not alter the likelihood of the outcomes \\(e^k\\)\nof other experiments \\(c^k\\). To appreciate the significance of this\ncondition, imagine what it would be like if it were violated. Suppose\nhypothesis \\(h_j\\) is some statistical theory, say, for example, a\nquantum theory of superconductivity. The conditions expressed in\n\\(c^k\\) describe a number of experimental setups, perhaps conducted in\nnumerous labs throughout the world, that test a variety of aspects of\nthe theory (e.g., experiments that test electrical conductivity in\ndifferent materials at a range of temperatures). An outcome sequence\n\\(e^k\\) describes the results of these experiments. The violation of\ncondition-independence would mean that merely adding to\n\\(h_{j}\\cdot b\\cdot c^{k}\\) a statement \\(c_{k+1}\\) describing how an\nadditional experiment has been set up, but with no mention of its\noutcome, changes how likely the evidence sequence \\(e^k\\) is taken to\nbe. What \\((h_j\\cdot b)\\) says via likelihoods about the\noutcomes \\(e^k\\) of experiments \\(c^k\\) differs as a result of merely\nsupplying a description of another experimental arrangement,\n\\(c_{k+1}\\). Condition-independence, when it holds, rules out\nsuch strange effects.\n\nResult-independence says that the description of previous\ntest conditions together with their outcomes is irrelevant to\nthe likelihoods of outcomes for additional experiments. If this\ncondition were widely violated, then in order to specify the most\ninformed likelihoods for a given hypothesis one would need to include\ninformation about volumes of past observations and their outcomes.\nWhat a hypothesis says about future cases would depend on how past\ncases have gone. Such dependence had better not happen on a\nlarge scale. Otherwise, the hypothesis would be fairly useless, since\nits empirical import in each specific case would depend on taking into\naccount volumes of past observational and experimental results.\nHowever, even if such dependencies occur, provided they are not too\npervasive, result-independence can be accommodated rather\neasily by packaging each collection of result-dependent data\ntogether, treating it like a single extended experiment or\nobservation. The result-independence condition will then be\nsatisfied by letting each term \u2018\\(c_k\\)\u2019 in the statement\nof the independence condition represent a conjunction of test\nconditions for a collection of result-dependent tests, and by\nletting each term \u2018\\(e_k\\)\u2019 (and each term\n\u2018\\(o_{ku}\\)\u2019) stand for a conjunction of the corresponding\nresult-dependent outcomes. Thus, by packaging\nresult-dependent data together in this way, the\nresult-independence condition is satisfied by those\n(conjunctive) statements that describe the separate,\nresult-independent\n chunks.[14]\n\n\nThe version of the Likelihood Ratio Convergence Theorem we\nwill examine depends only on the Independent Evidence\nConditions (together with the axioms of probability theory). It\ndraws on no other assumptions. Indeed, an even more general version of\nthe theorem can be established, a version that draws on neither of the\nIndependent Evidence Conditions. However, the Independent\nEvidence Conditions will be satisfied in almost all scientific\ncontexts, so little will be lost by assuming them. (And the\npresentation will run more smoothly if we side-step the added\ncomplications needed to explain the more general result.)\n\nFrom this point on, let us assume that the following versions of the\nIndependent Evidence Conditions hold. \n\n\nAssumption: Independent Evidence Assumptions. For\neach hypothesis h and background b under consideration,\nwe assume that the experiments and observations can be packaged into\ncondition statements, \\(c_1 ,\\ldots ,c_k, c_{k+1},\\ldots\\), and\npossible outcomes in a way that satisfies the following\nconditions:\n\n Each sequence of possible outcomes \\(e^k\\) of a sequence of\nconditions \\(c^k\\) is condition-independent of\nadditional conditions \\(c_{k+1}\\)\u2014i.e., \n\n\\[P[e^k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c^{k}\\cdot c_{k+1}] = P[e^k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c^k].\\]\n Each possible outcome \\(e_k\\) of condition \\(c_k\\) is\nresult-independent of sequences of other observations\nand possible outcomes \\((c^{k-1}\\cdot e^{k-1})\\)\u2014i.e.,\n\n\\[P[e_k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c_k\\cdot(c^{k-1}\\cdot e^{k-1})] = P[e_k \\pmid  h\\cdot b\\cdot c_k].\\]\n\n\n\nWe now have all that is needed to begin to state the Likelihood\nRatio Convergence Theorem.\n",
