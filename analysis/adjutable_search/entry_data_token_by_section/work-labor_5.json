    "main_text": "Justice and the Politics of Work || Distributive Justice\n3.1 Distributive Justice\n\nMost accounts of justice assume that a large number of individuals\nwithin a given society will engage in paid work. A crucial moral\nquestion, then, is what individuals are entitled to with respect to\nboth the benefits and the harms of work. How, in other words, are the\ngoods and bads of work justly distributed?\n\nOne possible answer to this question is that each worker is entitled\nto whatever benefits their talents and abilities enable them to secure\nin a labor market governed purely by supply and demand. This answer\nentails that those whose talents or abilities are in high demand\nand/or short supply will command greater benefits from prospective\nemployers than those whose talents or abilities are in low demand\nand/or generously supplied (Boatright 2010). (This same logic would\napply to those who use their labor to produce goods for sale rather\nthan those in employment arrangements.)\n\nAfter the early decades of the twentieth century, many nations\nimplemented policies at odds with this \u2018pure market\u2019\nvision of work and labor. Most have wage regulations, for example,\nmandating a minimum level of pay. But the justice of minimum levels of\npay is disputed, with some theorists arguing that disallowing a person\nto sell her labor at a price she judges adequate infringes on her\npersonal liberty. According to many libertarian thinkers, our labor is\nan exercise of our bodies or our talents, each of which we own in a\nway akin to our ownership of private property. To disallow someone the\nright to sell their labor even at a very low cost thus infringes on\ntheir rights of self-ownership. (Mack 2002) The fairness of wage\ndifferentials is also disputed. Should wages track the economic value\nof a worker\u2019s contributions or their effort, or are wages\nprimarily an incentive to encourage worker commitment and motivation?\n(Heath 2018, Moriarty 2020) Some theorists have proposed that\ninequalities in pay ought to be eliminated altogether (\u00d6rtenblad\n2021), while some supporters of an unconditional basic income, in\nwhich individuals receive regular payments regardless of their working\nstatus, see it an alternative way to ensure a sufficient minimum\nincome, one immune to workers becoming unemployed (van Parijs and\nVanderbroght 2017).\n\nDistributive justice also pertains to various protections against\nharms or wrongs associated with work. Again, most\nsocieties place legal limitations on various conditions of work. These\ninclude protections against overwork via limitations on the length of\nthe workday or workweek; bans on discrimination in hiring or promotion\nbased on race, gender, religion, or other social categories;\nassurances that workplace risks and dangers are mitigated; and, at a\nwider societal level, prohibitions aimed at ensuring that individuals\nlives are not dominated by work at particular life stages (bans on\nchild labor and provisions to make retirement possible). One important\nmoral question about these protections is whether workers should have\nthe right to bargain away some of these protections either for\nincreased pay (as when employees negotiate higher wages in exchange\nfor performing more dangerous jobs) or for enhancements in other\nprotections.\n",
