    "main_text": "Esotericism, Censorship, and Polemics\n5. Development in the Literary form of Medieval Philosophy\n\nThe Islamic and Jewish traditions, as well as the Latin tradition\nuntil the 13th century, can be characterized by the diversity of\nliterary forms for philosophical texts. A good deal of the\nphilosophical creativity among these writers goes into the form in\nwhich they choose to write. The genres that dominate the 13th and 14th\ncentury in the Latin West, the Sentences commentary, the\ndisputed question, and the logical developments of these forms in\nobligationes and sophismata, are academic, highly\nchoreographed forms. In contrast to the earlier period, these forms do\nnot allow an author much creative latitude. It is possible to read the\ndevelopment and waning of various forms and the movement toward\nstandard forms in medieval philosophy in different ways. From one\npoint of view, the variety of forms which flourished from the 10th to\nthe 12th century can be seen as the high point from which the\nnarrowing into the academic forms of the 13th and 14th centuries seems\nlike a loss, not only in variety but from the connection to the larger\nspiritual and existential concerns treated in, for example, the\nallegories of Boethius or Avicenna and the meditations of Anselm. Both\nin the Byzantine world and in the Latin Renaissance, there is a\nrejection of scholastic forms in preference for the richer rhetorical\nand literary form of dialogue (see Buron, Gu\u00e9rin, and Lesage\n2015; Cameron and Gaul 2017). From another point of view (the more\nprevalent assumption of the secondary literature), the disputed\nquestion and other forms of high scholasticism are that toward which\nthe earlier centuries made somewhat uneven but steady steps. In these\nforms, some might argue, philosophy finds its center in arguments for\nand against different positions. (See Kretzmann 1997, 301, where he\nargues that issues of style and rhetoric are not relevant to\nAquinas\u2019 \u201cunadorned, straightforward, pellucid way of\nexpounding, analyzing, and arguing \u2014 [which is] ideal for\nphilosophy\u201d.) The assumption, one arguably bequeathed to the\nWestern philosophical tradition through Latin Medieval school forms,\nis that \u201cstraightforward argument\u201d is not itself a style,\nrhetoric, and/or genre but the pure form of rationality and, hence,\nphilosophy. Arguably, at least in the Latin tradition, this way of\nseeing philosophy as having only one form, the form of reason, was\nprompted by the reception of Aristotle\u2019s Posterior\nAnalytics with its model of demonstration as the standard for\nscience. Syllogistic arguments comprised of certain and necessary\npremises yield certain and necessary conclusions, making demonstration\na higher form than dialectic, which yields only probable conclusions,\nor rhetorical forms and methods, designed to persuade particular\naudiences. John of Salisbury, making his way through the Posterior\nAnalytics, writes in his Metalogicon (1159) that unlike\nother dialectical or rhetorical forms of arguments, only demonstration\ndoes not concern itself with those to be persuaded and is thus in\ndirect relationship to things. (John of Salisbury 1955, 79) In effect\nthis is the articulation of the standard of objectivity \u2013 that\nwhich is simply true independent of the time, place, or audience to\nwhom it is addressed, as opposed to that which is designed to persuade\nin a particular context. Thus, John makes scientific discourse \u2013\nand the pursuit of truth \u2013 the opposite of rhetorical and\nliterary discourse, giving reason (and, hence, philosophy) its ideal\nform. John notes that Aristotle is called \u201cthe\nPhilosopher\u201d because of his development of the science of\ndemonstration. (John of Salisbury 1955, 213) As Aristotle\u2019s\nideal of scientific demonstration and the Aristotelian corpus as a\nwhole forms university curriculum, philosophy also becomes the\ndiscipline we recognize as \u2018philosophy\u2019, an enterprise of\nreason alone and begins to function autonomously in the arts faculty,\nwhich were earlier seen as only preparatory to theology, law, or\nmedicine. We can also see different medieval forms for philosophy as\nindebted to either Plato or Aristotle as philosophical models.\nAristotle\u2019s influence we see in the culture and writings of the\nuniversity. Even though they lacked access to the Platonic dialogues,\nthe influence of Plato through Neoplatonism is evident in the forms\nthat flourish before the 13th century, in allegory, meditation, and\ndialogue. These forms emphasize both the spiritual character of the\nhighest truths philosophical/theological discourse strives to discover\nand reveal, and the difficulty, both intellectual and moral, of\nachieving insight.\n\nMuch more work needs to be done on the literary forms of medieval\nphilosophy. There are so many forms instantiated in so many ways in\ndifferent periods and from within different religious traditions.\nConsideration of these forms is especially important for a more\ncomplete understanding of medieval philosophical texts because so many\nof these forms are foreign to contemporary readers. Sometimes the form\nis important because an author was constrained by practice or academic\nstatute to use it, as with disputations and Sentences\ncommentaries; hence, how an author comes to use or manipulate a given\nform for his own ends is a significant part of understanding the text.\nWhen an author uses a non-standard form, that form is self-consciously\nchosen and thus in a different way a significant part of an\nauthor\u2019s meaning. It would be helpful to have studies of\nparticular authors who have used different forms, and more studies\ntracing the development of a given genre through different authors and\nperiods (as in Jacobi 1999 on dialogue and Whitman 2000 on allegory,\nEvans 2002 and Rosemann 2009 on Sentences commentaries).\nFinally, more historical work needs to be done by individual scholars\nequipped to look at the different genres across different periods and\nfrom within and across works arising out of Christian, Jewish, and\nArabic religious traditions. (See Hughes and Robinson 2019 on literary\nforms in Medieval Jewish Thought.). For Hughes and Robinson philosophy\nis never without literary form, nor (which comes to the same thing)\ndoes it have only one; they work to challenge the narrow conception of\nphilosophy that would divide the study of \u2018philosophical\u2019\ntexts from those that fall into the domain of \u201cJewish\nstudies\u201d that have more diverse literary forms. In the same way,\nwe have seen those studying the philosophical work of early Modern\nwomen make the case that we will miss this work if we restrict\nourselves to texts that take the form that is expected in contemporary\nacademic philosophy. Expanding the canon entails interrogating and\nbroadening the sense of what counts as a philosophical work, they\nargue. \n",
