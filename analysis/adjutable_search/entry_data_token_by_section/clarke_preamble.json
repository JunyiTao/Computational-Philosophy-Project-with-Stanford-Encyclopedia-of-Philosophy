    "main_text": "\n\nSamuel Clarke (1675\u20131729) was the most influential British\nmetaphysician and theologian in the generation between Locke and\nBerkeley, and only Shaftesbury rivals him in ethics. In all three\nareas he was very critical of Hobbes, Spinoza, and Toland. Deeply\ninfluenced by Newton, Clarke was critical of Descartes\u2019\nmetaphysics of space and body because of the experimental evidence for\nNewtonianian doctrines of space, the vacuum, atoms, and attraction and\nbecause he believed Descartes\u2019 identifying body with extension\nand removing final causes from nature had furthered irreligion and had\nnaturally developed into Spinozism.\n\nClarke sided with Locke and Newton against Descartes in denying that\nwe have knowledge of the essence of substances, even though we can be\nsure that there are at least two kinds of substances (mental and\nmaterial) because their properties (thinking and divisibility) are\nincompatible. He defended natural religion against the naturalist view\nthat nature constitutes a self-sufficient system and defended revealed\nreligion against deism. Clarke adopted Newton\u2019s natural\nphilosophy early on. Through his association with Newton, Clarke was\nthe de facto spokesperson for Newtonianism in the first half\nthe eighteenth century, not only explaining the natural science but\nalso providing a metaphysical support and theological interpretation\nfor it.\n\nIn what follows, we use \u201cW\u201d as an abbreviation to cite\npassages from the four-volume The Works, edited posthumously\nby Benjamin Hoadly. Two recent editions of Clarke\u2019s major works\nare more widely available and thus cited here as well: \u201cD\u201d\nfor passages in A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God\nand Other Writings in Vailati (1998), and \u201cCC\u201d for\npassages in The Correspondence of Samuel Clarke and Anthony\nCollins (Uzgalis (ed.) 2011). References to the Leibniz-Clarke\ncorrespondence (available in many print and online editions) include\nthe letter and section number preceded by an \u201cL\u201d for\nLeibniz and \u201cC\u201d for Clarke (e.g., L 1.4 refers to\nLeibniz\u2019s first letter, section four).\n",
