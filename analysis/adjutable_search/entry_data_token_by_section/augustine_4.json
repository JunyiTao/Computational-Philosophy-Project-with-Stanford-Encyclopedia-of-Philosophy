    "main_text": "Theory of Knowledge || Skepticism and Certainty\n5.1 Skepticism and Certainty\n\nAugustine\u2019s earliest surviving work is a dialogue on Academic\nskepticism (Contra Academicos or De Academicis, 386;\nFuhrer 1997). He wrote it at the beginning of his career as a\nChristian philosopher in order to save himself and his readers from\nthe \u201cdespair\u201d that would have resulted if it could not be\nproven that, against the skeptic challenge, truth is attainable and\nknowledge and wisdom possible (cf. Retractationes 1.1.1). The\nsense of despair must have been very real to him when, after having\nbroken with Manicheism but still being unable to see the truth of\nCatholic Christianity, he decided to \u201cwithhold assent until some\ncertainty lighted up\u201d (Confessiones 5.25). His\ninformation about skepticism does not come from a contemporary skeptic\n\u201cschool\u201d, which hardly existed, but from Cicero\u2019s\nAcademica and Hortensius. Much of the discussion in\nContra Academicos is thus devoted to the debate between\nHellenistic Stoics and skeptics about the so-called\n\u201cgrasping\u201d or kataleptic appearance, i.e., the problem\nwhether there are appearances about the truth of which one cannot be\nmistaken because they are evident by themselves (Bermon 2001:\n105\u2013191). Unlike the original Stoics and Academics, Augustine\nlimits the discussion to sense impressions because he wants to present\nPlatonism as a solution to the skeptic problem and to point out a\nsource of true knowledge unavailable to the Hellenistic\nmaterialists.\n\nUnlike modern anti-skeptical lines of argumentation, Augustine\u2019s\nrefutation of skepticism does not aim at justifying our ordinary\npractices and beliefs. To refute the Academic claim that, since the\nwise person can never be sure whether she has grasped the truth, she\nwill consistently withhold assent in order not to succumb to empty\nopinion, he thinks it sufficient to demonstrate the existence of some\nkind of knowledge that is immune to skeptical doubt. His strategy\ntherefore consists in pointing out 1) the certainty of\nself-referential knowledge (the wise person \u201cknows\nwisdom\u201d, Contra Academicos 3.6; the Academic skeptic\n\u201cknows\u201d the Stoic criterion of truth, ib. 3.18\u201321);\n2) the certainty of private or subjective knowledge (I am certain that\nsomething appears white to me even if I am ignorant\nwhether it is really white, ib. 3.26); 3) the certainty of formal,\nlogical or mathematical, structures (ib. 3.24\u201329), knowledge of\nwhich is possible independently of the mental state of the knower,\nwhereas the reliability of sense impressions differs according as we\nare awake or dreaming, sane or insane. Modern critics have not been\nvery impressed by these arguments (e.g., Kirwan 1989: 15\u201334),\nand an ancient skeptic would rightly have objected that being limited\nto subjective or formal knowledge, they could not justify the\ndogmatists\u2019 claim to objective knowledge of reality (cf. Sextus\nEmpiricus, Outlines of Pyrrhonism 1.13). Yet this is not\nAugustine\u2019s point. To him it matters to have shown that even if\nmaximal concessions are made to skepticism concerning the\nunknowability of the external world attainable by the senses, there\nremains an internal area of cognition that allows for and even\nguarantees certainty. This is why Contra Academicos ends with\na sketch of Platonic epistemology and ontology and with an\nidiosyncratic if not wholly unparalleled reconstruction of the history\nof the Academy according to which the Academics were in fact\ncrypto-Platonists who hid their insight into transcendent reality and\nrestricted themselves to skeptical arguments to combat the materialist\nand sensualist schools dominant in Hellenistic times until authentic\nPlatonism emerged again with Plotinus (Contra Academicos\n3.37\u201343; the story is still told in Letter 118 of 410,\nwhere the renaissance of Platonism is however connected with the rise\nof Christianity). The only realities that meet the Hellenistic\ncriterion of truth and guarantee absolute certainty by being\nself-evident are the Platonic Forms (Contra Academicos 3.39;\ncf. De diversis quaestionibus 9; Cary 2008a: 55\u201360).\nThe \u201cobjects\u201d of knowledge that appear in\nAugustine\u2019s anti-skeptical arguments thus either are the\nPlatonic Forms themselves or at least point out the way of accessing\nthem. This squares with the early Augustine\u2019s tendency to\ninterpret the Forms, or at any rate the most basic among them, as\n\u201cnumbers\u201d, i.e., as the formal and normative structures\nand standards that govern all reality and enable us to understand and\nevaluate it (De ordine 2.14; 16; De musica\n6.57\u201358; O\u2019Daly 1987: 101\u2013102; see also\n ",
