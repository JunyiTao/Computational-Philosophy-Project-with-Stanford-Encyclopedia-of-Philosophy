    "main_text": "Causal Modeling || Identifiability of Causal Structure\n3.5 Identifiability of Causal Structure\n\nThe original hope of Reichenbach and Suppes was to provide a reduction\nof causation to probabilities. To what extent has this hope been\nrealized within the causal modeling framework? Causal modeling does\nnot offer a reduction in the traditional philosophical sense; that is,\nit does not offer an analysis of the form \u2018X causes\nY if and only if\u2026\u2019 where the right hand side of\nthe bi-conditional makes no reference to causation. Instead, it offers\na series of postulates about how causal structure constrains the\nvalues of probabilities. Still, if we have a set of variables \\(\\bV\\)\nand a probability distribution P on \\(\\bV\\), we may ask if P suffices\nto pick out a unique causal graph \\(\\bG\\) on \\(\\bV\\).\n\nPearl (1988: Chapter 3) proves the following theorem:\n\n(Identifiability with time-order)\n\n\nIf\n\n the variables in \\(\\bV\\) are time-indexed, such that only earlier\nvariables can cause later ones;\n the probability P assigns positive probability to every possible\nassignment of values of the variables in \\(\\bV\\);\n there are no latent common causes, so that the correct causal\ngraph \\(\\bG\\) is a DAG;\n and the probability measure P satisfies the Markov and Minimality\nConditions with respect to \\(\\bG\\);\n\n\nthen it will be possible to uniquely identify \\(\\bG\\) on the basis of\nP.\n\n\n\nIn many ways, this result successfully executes the sort of project\ndescribed in Section 2\nabove. That is, making the same sorts of assumptions about\ntime-indexing, and substantive assumptions about the connection\nbetween probability and causation, it establishes that it is possible\nto identify causal structure using probabilities.\n\nIf we don\u2019t have information about time ordering, or other\nsubstantive assumptions restricting the possible causal structures\namong the variables in \\(\\bV\\), then it will not always be possible to\nidentify the causal structure from probability alone. In general,\ngiven a probability distribution P on \\(\\bV\\), it is only possible to\nidentify a Markov equivalence class of causal structures.\nThis will be the set of all DAGs on \\(\\bV\\) that (together with MC)\nimply all and only the conditional independence relations contained in\nP. The PC algorithm (SGS 2000: 84\u201385), named for its\ntwo creators (Peter Spirtes and Clark Glymour), is one\nalgorithm that generates the Markov equivalence class for any given\nprobability distribution.\n\n\nConsider two simple examples involving three variables \\(\\{X, Y,\nZ\\}\\). Suppose our probability distribution has the following\nproperties:\n\n X and Y are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on Z\n Y and Z are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on X\n X and Z are dependent unconditionally, but\nindependent conditional on Y\n\n\nThen the Markov equivalence class is: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nX \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\\\\\nX \\leftarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\\\\\nX \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nWe cannot determine from the probability distribution, together with\nMC and Faithfulness, which of these structures is correct.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose the probability distribution is as\nfollows:\n\n X and Y are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on Z\n Y and Z are dependent unconditionally, and\nconditional on X\n X and Z are independent unconditionally, but\ndependent conditional on Y\n\n\nThen the Markov equivalence class is: \n\n\\[X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\\]\n\n\nNote that the first probability distribution on \\(\\{X, Y, Z\\}\\) is\nthat characterized by Reichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle. The\nsecond distribution reverses the relations between X and\nZ: they are unconditionally independent and\nconditionally dependent. Contrary to Reichenbach, it is\nactually the latter pattern of dependence relations that is most\nuseful for orienting the causal arrows in the graph. In the last\ncausal structure shown, Y is a collider on the path from\nX to Z. MCd-separation implies that\ncolliders give rise to distinctive conditional independence relations,\nwhile all three types of non-collider give rise to the same\nconditional independence relations. Many of the algorithms that have\nbeen developed for inferring causal structure from probabilities work\nby searching for colliders (see, e.g., SGS 2000: Chapter 5).\n\nThe identifiability results discussed so far all assume that the\ncorrect causal graph is a DAG. However, it is common that latent\nvariables will be present, and even more common that we might wish to\nallow for the possibility of latent variables (whether they are\nactually there or not). If we allow that the correct causal graph may\ncontain double-headed arrows, we can still apply\nMCd-separation, and ask which graphs imply the same\nsets of conditional independence relations. The\nMarkov equivalence class will be larger than it was when we did not\nallow for latent variables. For instance, given the last set of\nprobability relations described above, the graph \n\n\\[X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z\\]\n\n\nis no longer the only one compatible with this distribution. The\nstructure \n\n\\[X \\leftrightarrow Y \\leftrightarrow Z\\]\n\n\nis also possible, as are several others.\n",
