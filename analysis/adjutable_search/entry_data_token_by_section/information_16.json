Systematic Considerations\n\nIn a mathematical sense information is associated with measuring\nextensive properties of classes of systems with finite but unlimited\ndimensions (systems of particles, texts, codes, networks, graphs,\ngames etc.). This suggests that a uniform treatment of various\ntheories of information is possible. In the Handbook of Philosophy of\nInformation three different forms of information are distinguished\n(Adriaans & van Benthem 2008b):\n\n\nInformation-A:\n\nKnowledge, logic, what is conveyed in informative answers\n\nInformation-B:\n\nProbabilistic, information-theoretic, measured quantitatively\n\nInformation-C:\n\nAlgorithmic, code compression, measured quantitatively\n\n\nBecause of recent development the connections between Information-B\n(Shannon) and Information-C (Kolmogorov) are reasonably well\nunderstood (Cover & Thomas 2006). The historical material\npresented in this article suggests that reflection on Information-A\n(logic, knowledge) is historically much more interwoven than was\ngenerally known up till now. The research program of logical\npositivism can with hindsight be characterized as the attempt to marry\na possible worlds interpretation of logic with probabilistic reasoning\n(Carnap 1945, 1950; Popper 1934; for a recent approach see Hutter et\nal. 2013). Modern attempt to design a Bayesian epistemology (Bovens\n& Hartmann 2003) do not seem to be aware of the work done in the\nfirst half of the twentieth century. However, an attempt to unify\nInformation-A and Information-B seems a viable exercise (Adriaans\n2020). Also the connection between thermodynamics and information\ntheory have become much closer, amongst others, due to the work of\nGell-Mann & Lloyd (2003) (see also: Bais and Farmer 2008).\nVerlinde (2011, 2017) even presented a reduction of gravity to\ninformation (see the entry on\n information processing and thermodynamic entropy).\n \n",
