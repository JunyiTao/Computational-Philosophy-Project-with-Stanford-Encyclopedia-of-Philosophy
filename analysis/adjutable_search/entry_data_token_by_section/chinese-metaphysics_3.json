    "main_text": "The Cosmogonic Turn || Monism\n3.1 Monism\n\nAll Chinese thinkers who discussed ultimate origins took that origin\nto be unique. The best known name for this source is dao\n\u9053, which means path, way, or guide. Another important name is\ntaiji \u592a\u6975, the \u201csupreme\n polarity.\u201d[5]\n The term taiji appears in the Yi Jing as the\noriginal unity from which yin and yang emerge. It\nremained an important term, particularly during the Confucian revival\nin the Song dynasty. Positing a single source had a decisive influence\non Chinese thought, as it implies an underlying unity and connection\nthat easily threatens differentiation and division (for the\nimplications of this idea of oneness, see Ivanhoe 2017 and Ivanhoe et.\nal. 2018). One of the most persistent metaphysical concerns is the\nontological status of difference and individuation (see Kwok 2016;\nPerkins 2015; Chai 2014a; Ziporyn 2013; Sim 2011; Fraser 2007; and Im\n2007). This orientation is the opposite of that in philosophies based\non dualisms or ontologically independent substances, views that were\ndominant through most of European intellectual history. We can say\nthat European metaphysics has tended to focus on problems of\nreconciliation (how ontologically distinct things can interact),\nwhile Chinese metaphysics has been more concerned with problems of\ndistinction (what grounds individuation).\n\nThere is some ambiguity in saying that the ultimate origin is one.\nChapter 42 of the Laozi says that \u201cthe one\u201d\n(yi \u4e00) generates two, which generates three and then\nthe myriad things, but claims that the one itself is not ultimate. It\nis generated from dao. Chapter 40 says that things are born\nfrom being [you \u6709], but being is generated from\nno-being [wu \u7121]. This reflects one of the earliest\nmetaphysical debates\u2014is this unitary origin a thing? There seems\nto have been advocates for each side, but the view that came to\ndominate is given as a principle in the Zhuangzi: \u201cwhat\nthings things is not itself a thing\u201d (wuwuzhe feiwu\n\u7269\u7269\u8005\u975e\u7269) (Guo 1978, 22: 763; cf.\nZiporyn 2009: 91).\n\nThe terms you \u6709 and wu \u7121 are among the\nmost important metaphysical terms in the Chinese tradition (see Jing\nLiu 2017; Chai 2014b; B. Wang 2011; Cheng 2009; Bai 2008; and the\nessays in Liu and Berger 2014). They are often translated as\n\u201cbeing\u201d and \u201cnon-being\u201d, but wu\nrefers not to radical nothingness but to the lack of differentiated\nbeings. Thus in the context of the Laozi, Hans-Georg Moeller\n(2007) translates the two terms as \u201cpresence\u201d and\n\u201cnon-presence\u201d, Roger T. Ames and David L. Hall (2003)\ntranslate them as \u201cdeterminate\u201d and\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d, and Brook Ziporyn (2014) as\n\u201cbeing-there\u201d and \u201cnot-being-there\u201d.\n\nTaking the ultimate as no-thing places it at or beyond the limits of\nlanguage. How to speak of the ultimate without making it into an\nobject or thing became another persistent philosophical issue. The\nZhuangzi points out that as soon as you label something, even\nas no-being (wu), it becomes a thing that needs its own\nexplanation:\n\n\nThere is being, there is no-being, there is not yet beginning to be\nno-being, there is not yet beginning to be not yet beginning to be\nno-being. (Guo 1978, 2: 79; cf. Ziporyn 2009: 15)\n\n\nThis dialectic between being and no-being was later taken up in a\ndifferent form through Buddhist debates about emptiness, and it can be\nconsidered one of the central metaphysical problems throughout the\nChinese philosophical tradition.\n",
