    "main_text": "Intrasubstantial Causation\n5. Intrasubstantial Causation\n\nWhatever can be predicated of a Leibnizian substance is either an\nattribute (a permanent and common characteristic (GP ii, 227, 257ff)),\nsometimes called \u201cproperty\u201d (GP ii, 258/L 533), or an\naccident (a transitory and individual characteristic (GP ii, 458/L\n605; GP iv, 363)), sometimes called \u201cmodification\u201d (G ii,\n258/L 533; GP ii, 503f). In contemporary lingo, we would call an\nattribute a \u201cproperty\u201d and accident a\n\u201cproperty-instance\u201d or \u201ctrope.\u201d Action is an\nattribute of substance, for Leibniz defines substance as \u201ca\nbeing capable of action\u201d (GP vi, 598). A perception is an\naccident of a substance, for the action of a substance consists\nprecisely in the fact that they are always changing their perceptions.\nNow, an attribute must not be considered a substance, since it would\nbe a mistake to equate action with what is acting, or extension with\nwhat is extended (New Essays A vi, 6, 210f). Neither is an\nattribute to be considered an accident, for \u201can attribute may be\npredicated of several substances at the same or at different times\nwhile an accident can never inhere in more than one substance at the\nsame or at different times\u201d (Clatterbaugh, 1978, 3).\n\nSo, for Leibniz, the essence of a created substance is activity, in\nthe sense of being continually in process of change of its perceptions\n(Letter to De Volder, January 21, 1704, GP ii, 263/L 534). The\naccidents (tropes or property-instances) of a substance are its\nperceptions. The change in a created substance must be caused\n(Primary Truths C 519/L 268), yet there can be no transeunt\n(i.e., intersubstantial) causation (Discourse on Metaphysics\n\u00a714, GP iv, 439/L 312/WF 66f). For causal interaction between\ncreated substances (i.e., monads) is in principle inexplicable\n(New System GP iv, 483/L 457) as seen earlier. Therefore, the\ncause of change of perceptions in a created substance is either to be\nlocated in an uncreated substance, namely God, or in the substance\nitself. But, as we have already seen, Leibniz rejects the view that\nGod alone is the real causal power driving change in substances; as\npreviously shown, he is no occasionalist (Notes on a Reply of\nFoucher, GP i, 373f/L 155). So, putting God aside for the moment,\nperceptual change is caused by the substance itself. But surely we\nwant to know what it is about the substance or in the substance that\ndrives perceptual change.\n\nWhat exactly causes the change of perceptions of a substance? Leibniz\nholds that both the \u201cprimitive active power\u201d of a\nsubstance and its perceptions or perceptual states play crucial causal\nroles in the changes of a substance. (As we shall see, furthermore,\nGod is no minor player in this effort as well.) The primitive active\npower of a substance, Leibniz tells us, is \u201ca nature or an\ninternal force that can produce in it, in an orderly way \u2026 all\nthe appearances or expressions it will have, without the help of any\ncreated being\u201d (New System GP iv, 486/AG 144).\nMoreover, \u201cthe present state of each substance is a natural\nresult [consequence] of its preceding state\u201d\n(Clarification of Difficulties concerning Monsieur Bayle GP\niv, 521).\n\nTo be clear, however, primitive powers and perceptions do not play the\nsame causal roles, according to Leibniz. Whereas the primitive power\nof a substance (some commentators maintain that primitive powers and\nsubstances are one and the same) is the efficient cause\u2014a\npost-Humean might say the real cause\u2014of the change of its\nperceptual states, these states themselves do not function as\nefficient causes. How perceptual states do function causally is\ncontroversial, and we will address this issue later. Whatever the\nfinal details of Leibniz\u2019s account happen to be regarding\nprimitive power and perception, one thing is clear: Leibniz\u2019s\naccount runs seriously counter to David Hume\u2019s regarding\ncausation. In 1748, Hume stated that his definition of cause entails\nthat \u201call causes are of the same kind\u201d (An Enquiry\nConcerning Human Understanding, 156), whereas Leibniz\nincorporates efficient, final, and formal causes in his theory of\ncausation. Before discussing these different kinds of causes, however,\nlet us consider a particularly vexed issue in Leibniz\u2019s account\nof causation: divine causation.\n",
