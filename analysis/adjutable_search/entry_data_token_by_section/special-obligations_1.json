    "main_text": "Special Obligations and Agent-Relativity\n2. Special Obligations and Agent-Relativity\n\nThe discussion of the previous section stressed that the alleged\ndifficulties that consequentialism has in accommodating the\ncommonsense understanding of special obligations arise from the fact\nthat the consequentialist can allow only derivatively, not genuinely,\nspecial obligations. Another way to express this point is to say that\nthe consequentialist allows only agent-neutral reasons, whereas\nspecial obligations, as understood by commonsense, are agent-relative\nreasons. Derek Parfit understands agent-neutral as opposed to\nagent-relative reasons in the following way:\n\nSuppose we claim that there is a reason to relieve some person\u2019s\nsuffering. This reason is objective if it is a reason for everyone\n\u2013 for anyone who could relieve this person\u2019s suffering. I\ncall such reasons agent-neutral. \u2026 When I call some reason\nagent-relative, I am not claiming that this reason cannot be a reason\nfor other agents. All that I am claiming is that it may not be (143).\n\n\nThomas Nagel explicates the difference between agent-neutral and\nagent-relative reasons in a slightly different way: \n\nIf a reason can be given a general form which does not include an\nessential reference to the person who has it, it is an \nagent-neutral  reason. For example, if it is a reason for anyone\nto do or want something that it would reduce the amount of\nwretchedness in the world, then that is a neutral reason. If on the\nother hand the general form of a reason does include an essential\nreference to the person who has it, it is an  agent-relative \nreason. For example, if it is a reason for anyone to do or want\nsomething that it would be in  his  interest, then that is a\nrelative reason. In such a case, if something were in Jones\u2019s\ninterest but contrary to Smith\u2019s, Jones would have reason to\nwant it to happen and Smith would have the same reason to want it not\nto happen (1986 152\u2013153).\n\n\nThus, special obligations would be understood by Parfit and Nagel as\nagent-relative reasons: my reason to take care of my friend by giving\nher encouraging words may not be shared by anyone else (even when in a\nposition which makes it possible for her to do that), and the\n\u201cform of the reason \u2026 include[s] an essential reference\nto the person who has it\u201d \u2013 I have reason to give my\nfriend encouraging words. \n\nWe can make Parfit\u2019s explanation of the distinction between\nagent-neutral reasons and agent-relative reasons more precise in the\nfollowing way:\n\nAgent-Neutral Reason: S\u2019s reason to do or to promote p is\nan agent-neutral reason if and only if, necessarily, for any Q,\nQ would also have that reason to do or to promote p if\nQ were in a causal position to do or to promote p. All\nother reasons are agent-relative.\n\n\nIt is important to see that an agent could have more than one reason\nto promote any given state of affairs, some of those reasons being\nagent-neutral, others agent-relative. Consider Peter\u2019s reasons\nto buy Mary a dinner that she will enjoy. If enjoyment or pleasure is\nintrinsically valuable, then Peter will reason R to buy Mary that\ndinner, where R is grounded or constituted by Mary\u2019s enjoyment\nof the dinner. If Paul, like Peter, is casually placed so as to be\nable to provide Mary with that intrinsically valuable enjoyment, then\nPaul also has reason R to do so. But now suppose that Peter is\nMary\u2019s friend. Defenders of special obligations of friendship\nare likely to claim that Peter also has reason R* to buy\nthat dinner for Mary, where R* is generated or grounded or\nconstituted by his friendship with Mary. If Paul is not Mary\u2019s\nfriend, then he does not stand in the friendship relation to her, and\nso he will not have reason R* (or any reason of that type)\nto buy Mary dinner, regardless of his causal placement. Thus,\nPeter\u2019s reason R* is an agent-relative reason,\nwhereas R was agent-neutral.\n\nNotice that on this definition of agent-neutrality and its\ncorrespondent definition of agent-relativity, nearness in space cannot\nbe an ultimate ground of an agent-relative reason. When we think of\nnearness affecting our moral obligations, it seems that it does so by\naffecting our causal efficacy in providing aid: we are standing on the\nbank of a river in which someone is drowning, someone has had a heart\nattack in the room where we are and we know CPR, etc. In all of these\ncases, if someone else had been in our spatial position, he or she\nwould have been in our causal position and so would have had the same\nduty to aid as we do. And spatial position does not seem to have any\nother significance beyond its effect on causal position. After all, if\nsomeone had been further away but able to push a button to activate a\nmachine that would save the one drowning, then she would have had the\nsame duty to aid as we did. (See Orsi for a discussion of nearness and\nobligations.) \n\nBut friendship and promising, for example, are not like spatial\nposition, i.e., it does not seem that the relevance of these\nrelationships is a matter of the parties to them being best causally\nsituated to provide aid. Even if a person who is wealthier than me is\nactually in a better position to aid my friend, it nonetheless seems\nto be the case that I have some reason to aid my friend that the\nperson at least as well or better causally situated to do so does not\nhave. She may have stronger agent-neutral reason to aid my friend, but\nshe does not have the agent-relative reason arising from friendship\nthat I have. \n\nDo we have such genuinely agent-relative special obligations? We can\nsee the difficulty in accepting special obligations through another\ncontrast, this one with natural duties as understood by commonsense\nmorality.\n",
