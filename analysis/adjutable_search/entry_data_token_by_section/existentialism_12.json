    "main_text": "Authenticity || Kierkegaard\u2019s Knight of Faith\n5.2 Kierkegaard\u2019s Knight of Faith\nFor Kierkegaard, the authentic individual is someone that is\n\u201cwilling to be one\u2019s own self.\u201d (1843 [1989, 43]) He,\nshe, or they recognize(s) that there is more to life than following the\ncrowd or chasing surface pleasures. Such a life is invariably scattered\nand disjointed, pulled apart by temporal desires and the fleeting fads\nand fashions of the public. Authenticity requires a passionate,\n\u201cpersonality defining\u201d (personligheds definerende)\ndecision or commitment that binds together and unifies the fragmented\nand disjointed moments of our life into a focused and coherent whole.\nThe \u201cunifying power\u201d of commitment is embodied in, what\nKierkegaard calls, an attitude of \u201cearnestness\u201d\n(alvor), a sober recognition that existence is a serious\naffair, not a pleasure-seeking masquerade. But authenticity cannot be\nachieved simply by means of renouncing temporal pleasures and doing\none\u2019s duty according to some universal moral principle\u2014such\nas the Ten Commandments or Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative. This is\nbecause, for Kierkegaard, the subjective truth of the individual is\nhigher than the universal truths of morality. And this means there may\nbe times in our lives where we must suspend our obligation to the\nethical sphere and accept the terrible fact that it may be more\nimportant to be authentic (to be true to oneself) than it is to be\nmoral (to do what is right.)\nIn Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard draws on the biblical\nfigure of Abraham to make this point. As a father, Abraham has a moral\nduty to love and protect his son, but when God demands that he break\nthis commandment and kill Isaac, he is confronted with a personal truth\nthat is higher than the universal. In committing himself to this truth,\nAbraham becomes a \u201cknight of faith\u201d by\n\u201cleaping\u201d (springer) into a paradox, one where the\ntruth of \u201cthe singular individual is higher than the\nuniversal\u201d (1843 [1985, 84]). As a religious existentialist,\nKierkegaard contends that this is what is required to enter the sphere\nof faith and become a Christian. It has nothing to do with membership\nin a congregation or obedience to doctrinal statements. It is, rather,\na willingness to commit to a truth that is fundamentally irrational and\nabsurd. How, for example, can one make rational sense of God\u2019s\ncommand to Abraham to kill his own son? \u201cThe problem,\u201d\nwrites Kierkegaard, \u201cis not to understand Christianity, but to\nunderstand that it cannot be understood\u201d (1835\u20131854 [1959,\n 146]).[7]\nAn\nauthentic or religious life, then, is always accompanied by anxiety and\nloneliness because the leap individualizes us; it cuts us off from the\ncomforting truths of the public and its blanket conceptions of right\nand wrong. It compels us to follow a path that no one else may\nunderstand. Abraham\u2019s decision is, for this reason, fraught with\ndespair. In his willingness to suspend his moral duty, he appears\n\u201cinsane\u201d because he \u201ccannot make himself understood\nto anyone.\u201d (1985 (1843], 103) \nBut with the despair of faith comes feelings of intensity, even\njoy, as we recognize the absurdity of religious existence, that the\neternal or divine is not found in some otherworldly realm, it is bound\nup in the temporal; that it is this life, the finite, that has\ninfinite significance. Freed from the temptations of the crowd and of\nblind obedience to moral principles, the knight of faith \u201ctakes\ndelight in everything he sees\u201d because he is now fully aware of\nthe majesty and richness of finitude. For him, \u201cfinitude tastes\njust as good as to one who has never known anything higher\u201d (1843\n[1985, 69\u201370]).\n",
