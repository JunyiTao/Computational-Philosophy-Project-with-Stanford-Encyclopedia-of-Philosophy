    "main_text": "Kant\n4. Kant\n\nThe first major philosopher actually to call himself an idealist was\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804), although as soon as he did so he\nlabored to distinguish his position from Berkeley\u2019s by calling\nhis position empirical realism combined with transcendental idealism,\nby which he means that space and time are ineliminable properties of\nour experience and of things as they appear to us but not real\nproperties of things as they are in themselves. However, since Kant\nneither denies the existence of things independent from our\nrepresentations of them nor asserts that these things must be mental\nin nature, the transcendental idealist part of his position cannot be\nstraightforwardly identified with idealism as he understood it or as\nwe are understanding it here, namely, as the position that reality is\nultimately mental in nature. While Kant thinks that he has given a\nsound argument for the transcendental ideality of space and time, he\nthinks he has given no reason at all to question the existence of\nthings independent from our representations of them.\n\nThe sources as well as the form of Kant\u2019s position are complex.\nKant was deeply impressed by what he knew of Leibniz (many of the\ntexts that are crucial to later understandings of Leibniz, such as\n\u201cPrimary Truths\u201d, having been unknown in Kant\u2019s\ntimes, or others, such as the New Essays on Human\nUnderstanding, having been published only when he was well into\nhis career) and the view that space and time are phaenomena bene\nfundata as well as by what he knew of Hume and his view that\ncausation is a form of thinking that we impose upon our experience\nrather than something we directly experience. He was more generally\nimpressed by the empiricist argument that our knowledge of objects\ndepends upon experience of them. However, he thought that both the\nLeibnizian and the Humean approaches failed to account for the\npossibility of synthetic a priori knowledge, that is,\nknowledge that goes beyond the mere analysis of concepts, that thus\ndoes more than merely unpack explicit or tacit definitions, but yet\nlegitimately claims universal and necessary validity. But, unlike\nPlato, the original apriorist avant la lettre, he does not\nsee synthetic a priori knowledge as leading to realism about\nobjects having the features that we know a priori, nor, like\nMalebranche, the theological Platonist, does he see such knowledge as\nknowledge of the mind of God; rather, he sees it as providing the\nconclusive argument for the idealist aspect of his position through\nthe premise that we can only know to be necessary and therefore\nuniversally valid the forms that we ourselves impose upon our\nexperience. Thus precisely because we have a priori knowledge\nof space and time, in his view they can be only features of our own\nrepresentations of things, not properties or relations of those things\nas they are in themselves. At the same time, even though when he wrote\nhis main works he was not well-informed on the aporia about subjects\nand objects about which Hume had ultimately thrown up his arms in the\nTreatise, which has here been characterized as the tension in\nHume between agnosticism and idealism, Kant recognized that we cannot\ntalk about what he called appearances without conceding the real\nexistence of subjects to which objects appear as well as the objects\nthat appear to such subjects. Kant was thus led to what he called\n\u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d, a position that combines\nidealism about the main forms of objects, that is, the view that we\nourselves impose spatiality, temporality, substantiality, causality,\nand other forms upon our experience and precisely because we know\nthese forms a priori cannot regard them as also the real\nforms of objects independent of ourselves, with a kind of ontological\nrealism, the view that in some sense both our selves and our objects\nreally do exist independently of our representations of them. Although\nhe identifies his own \u201ctranscendental idealism\u201d with\n\u201cempirical realism\u201d he does not want to call his own\nposition \u201ctranscendental realism\u201d, because for him that\nwould be the view that objects independent of our representations do\nexist with the forms that we represent them as having; that\nis, in Kant\u2019s terms, transcendental realism would be the view\nthat things really are spatial and temporal independently of our\nrepresenting them as such. Neither would he even be happy to call this\nconception of things in themselves a kind of idealism, because it is\npart of his position that, at least from what he calls a theoretical\npoint of view, we cannot suppose that even our own minds are\nreally as they appear to us, nor can we assert that the reality that\nultimately underlies the appearance of minds is essentially different\nfrom the reality that ultimately underlies the appearance of bodies.\nYet he remains confident that we are entitled to assert the existence\nof some sort of reality underlying the appearance of both minds and\nbodies. And to make matters even more complicated, he is confident\nthat we can rationally believe both ourselves and God to be\nmental in nature from what he calls a \u201cpractical\u201d point of\nview, that is, as necessary presuppositions of rationally attempting\nto do what morality commands. A complete characterization of\nKant\u2019s position would thus be empirical realism about\nspace, time, causation, and the other categories, transcendental\nidealism about space and time but combined with\nrealism about the existence of things in themselves,\nand now practical idealism about the nature of ourselves as\nthings in themselves and the nature of God, as in both cases\nessentially mental or spiritual. \n\nKant had already published a number of substantial scientific as well\nas philosophical works before the \u201cgreat light\u201d of\ntranscendental idealism came to him in 1769, leading to his first\nstatement of it the following year in his inaugural dissertation,\nOn the Forms and Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible\nWorlds (1770). But it would then take him another decade, the\nso-called \u201csilent decade\u201d, to publish his full argument\nfor transcendental idealism in the first edition of the Critique\nof Pure Reason, which appeared in 1781, and even then the\nrelation between the empirical realism and transcendental idealism\nthat he developed in that work continued to vex him: the first\nsubstantial review of the book in 1782 charged him with Berkeleianism,\nin other words, with idealism, and Kant then tried to rebut that\naccusation in his attempted popularization of the Critique,\nthe Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics of 1783, and to\nfurther defend that rebuttal of ordinary idealism in the\n\u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d that he added to the second\nedition of the Critique of Pure Reason in 1787. Even then he\nwas not done with the subject, as we know from a dozen further drafts\nof the \u201cRefutation\u201d that he composed after that\nsecond edition of the Critique. Indeed, Kant continued to\nstruggle with the clarification of his own position to the end of his\nlife, attempting a restatement of transcendental idealism in the\nuncompleted material for a final book that has come down to us under\nthe name of the Opus postumum. But since it was Kant\u2019s\npresentations of his position in the two editions of the\nCritique and the Prolegomena that were most\ninfluential in his own time and have been since, we shall concentrate\non those texts here. It was in these texts that Kant attempted to\nperfect his combination of empirical realism about space, time, and\nthe categories, transcendental idealism with regard to space and time,\nand yet realism (agnosticism) about the actual existence of things\ndistinct from our representations of them. It was then primarily in\nhis writings in moral philosophy, above all the Critique of\nPractical Reason of 1788, that he developed what we have called\nhis practical idealism about the real nature of the self and God. The\nsecond half of Kant\u2019s third and final critique, namely, the\nCritique of Teleological Judgment in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, uses Kant\u2019s complex position to justify the\nrevival of a teleological approach to nature that would seem to have\nalready been outmoded in Kant\u2019s time, but that will lie beyond\nthe purview of the present article (see Guyer 2005).\n\nKant\u2019s arguments for his transcendental idealism are distributed\nacross all parts of his Critique of Pure Reason. He gives a\ndirect argument for it in the Transcendental Aesthetic, supplemented\nby the Transcendental Analytic, and he gives an indirect argument for\nit in the Transcendental Dialectic by arguing that only his\ntranscendental idealism can allow us to avoid the paradoxes or\nconfusions of traditional metaphysics. We will comment first on\nKant\u2019s direct argument for transcendental idealism and then on\nhis indirect argument for it through the critique of traditional\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe direct argument is based on Kant\u2019s claim, substantiated in\nthe Transcendental Aesthetic, that we necessarily represent space and\ntime and objects in them by means of our a priori\nrepresentations of space and time, which are thus pure forms for the\nintuition of particular objects, and that we can construct proofs of\ntheorems about space and time by appeal to our a priori\nrepresentations or in \u201cpure intuition\u201d. But how does this\nlead to any form of idealism? Kant\u2019s chief argument is that\nspace and time can represent\n\n\nno property at all of any things in themselves nor any relations of\nthem to each other, i.e., no determination of them that attaches to\nobjects themselves and that would remain even if one were to abstract\nfrom all subjective conditions of intuition,\n\n\nand that space and time themselves can instead be only our\na priori representations of them and the spatial and temporal\nfeatures of objects in space and time only features of our\nrepresentations of them or of the \u201cappearances\u201d of\nobjects, because\n\n\nneither absolute nor relative determinations can be intuited prior to\nthe existence of the things to which they pertain, thus be intuited\na priori. (A 26/B 42)\n\n\nThe decisive point of this argument is the following: although because\nof our forms of intuition our particular representations\nnecessarily have spatio-temporal structure, any objects that\nhad that structure independently of our so representing them\nwould at best have such structure contingently, and thus the\nsupposedly synthetic a priori propositions about space, time,\nand their mathematics would not be necessarily true\nthroughout their domain. This argument thus exploits the key\nepistemological premise for idealism, namely that any isomorphism\nbetween knowledge and the known must be necessary. Kant is arguing\nthat since we have no ground to assert a necessary isomorphism between\nthe spatio-temporal structure of our experience and the\nspatio-temporal structure in things as they are in themselves, we must\ndeny the latter altogether. Kant makes this key move several times. In\nthe Critique, he poses the rhetorical question,\n\n\nIf there did not lie in you a faculty for intuiting a priori;\nif this subjective condition were not at the same time the universal\na priori condition under which alone the object\nof\u2026intuition is possible; if the object ([e.g.,] the triangle)\nwere something in itself without relation to your subject: then how\ncould you say that what necessarily lies in your subjective conditions\nfor constructing a triangle must also necessarily pertain to the\ntriangle in itself. (A 48/B 65)\n\n\nSimilarly, in the Prolegomena he writes that\n\n\nPure mathematics, and especially pure geometry, can have objective\nreality only under the single condition that it refers merely to\nobjects of the senses, with regard to which objects, however, the\nprinciple remains fixed, that our sensory representation is by no\nmeans a representation of things in themselves, but only of the way in\nwhich they appear to us,\n\n\nfor on the contrary supposition\n\n\nit absolutely would not follow from the representation of [e.g.]\nspace, a representation that serves a priori, with all the\nvarious properties of space, as foundation for the geometer, that all\nof this, together with what is deduced from it, must be exactly so in\nnature. The space of the geometer would [or could] be taken for mere\nfabrication and credited with no objective validity, because it is\nsimply not to be seen how things would have to agree necessarily with\nthe image that we form of them by ourselves and in advance. (\u00a713,\nNote I, 4:287)\n\n\nSo, Kant concludes, in order to be necessarily true throughout their\ndomain, the synthetic a priori propositions about space and\ntime\u2014and this includes not just the specific propositions of\ngeometry or mathematics more generally but also the general\npropositions derived in the metaphysical expositions, such as that\nspace and time are infinite singular wholes with parts rather than\ninstances\u2014must be true only of the representations on which we\nimpose our own forms of intuition, and cannot be true of things as\nthey are in themselves. This is Kant\u2019s chief argument for\ntranscendental idealism, the view that the way things appear to us\nessentially reflects our cognitive capacities rather anything\nintrinsic to them, combined with what we could call theoretically\nindeterminate ontological realism, the view that there are things\nindependent of our representations of them but because our most\nfundamental ways of representing things cannot be true of them we\ncannot know anything about them other than this fact\nitself\u2014until, that is, Kant brings his practical argument for\nour own ultimately mental nature and the mental nature of God on\nboard.\n\nIn a passage added to the second edition of the Critique,\nKant also points out that by arguing for the \u201ctranscendental\nideality\u201d of spatio-temporality\u2014that it is a necessary\nfeature of our representations of things but not a feature of things\nas they are in themselves at all\u2014he does not mean to degrade\nspace to a \u201cmere illusion\u201d, as did \u201cthe good\nBerkeley\u201d (B 71): his position is that it is a subjective but\nnecessary feature of our way of representing things, similar to\nsecondary qualities such as color or fragrance (B 70n) in being\nsubjective but unlike them in being necessary (see also A 29/B 45),\nand he thinks that by failing to see that the spatiality (in\nparticular) of our representations is necessary, Berkeley has\nunnecessarily \u201cdemoted\u201d it to a mere illusion.\nKant\u2019s larger objection to the charge that his position is not\ndifferent from Berkeley\u2019s is, however, that while denying the\nspatiality and temporality of things as they are in themselves, he has\nprovided no reason to deny that there are things distinct from our\nrepresentations of them and our own minds as representing them. But\nsince this larger objection is most clearly expounded and defended in\nthe Prolegomena and the \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d\nadded to the second edition of the Critique, which is\ninserted into the Transcendental Analytic, discussion of it can be\ndeferred for now.\n\nKant does not need to mount a separate argument for transcendental\nidealism in the Transcendental Analytic, because while that is aimed\nat showing that the use of certain concepts (the categories of pure\nunderstanding) and principles (the principles of pure understanding)\nare necessary conditions of any cognition of objects at all, indeed of\nself-consciousness (apperception) itself, but also yield knowledge\nonly when applied to intuitions, pure intuitions in the case of pure\nmathematical cognition and empirical intuitions in the case of\neverything else (thus Kant\u2019s famous statement \u201cWithout\nsensibility no object would be given to us, and without understanding\nnone would be thought. Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions\nwithout concepts are blind\u201d, A 51/B 75), since empirical\nintuitions have already been shown to yield appearances rather than\nthings in themselves, it automatically follows that the categories and\nprinciples of pure understanding will also yield cognition only of\nappearances. Nevertheless, Kant reaffirms transcendental idealism\nduring the course of the Transcendental Analytic.\n\nThe Transcendental Dialectic, the second half of the Critique of\nPure Reason in which Kant provides the critique of traditional\nmetaphysics is explicitly intended to give an indirect proof of\ntranscendental idealism (B xx). Specifically, the middle section of\nthe Dialectic, entitled \u201cThe Antinomy of Pure Reason\u201d, is\nsupposed to provide this indirect proof. All three sections of the\nDialectic, thus the preceding \u201cParalogisms of Pure Reason\u201d\nand the following \u201cIdeal of Pure Reason\u201d, are supposed to\nshow that the faculty of reason\u2019s inevitable conception of the\n\u201cunconditioned\u201d, that which is a condition for everything\nelse but itself has no condition, can never provide knowledge of any\nobject because knowledge requires intuition as well as concept, and\nintuition is always conditioned\u2014the representation of any region\nof space is conditioned by more surrounding it, and that of any region\nof time is likewise conditioned by the representation of more time\nbefore and after it. Reason can form \u201ctranscendental\nideas\u201d, more properly, \u201ctranscendent concepts\u201d (A\n327/B 384), that is, the ideas of an unconditioned subject (the self\nas substance), an unconditioned whole of all things and events (a\ncompleted world-whole), and an unconditioned ground of all possibility\n(God) (A 334/B 393). These ideas, according to Kant, may be useful as\nguidelines for scientific research and even necessary for the purposes\nof practical reason, but they outrun the limits of intuition and\ntherefore theoretical cognition. This general claim itself does not\nentail transcendental idealism, that is, it does not identify space\nand time with our own forms of intuition. However, Kant\u2019s claim\nis that the paradoxes diagnosed in the \u201cAntinomy of Pure\nReason\u201d can only be resolved on the basis of transcendental\nidealism. In the case of the first two antinomies he argues that both\nsides essentially concern space and time or the things in them (these\nare the arguments that as we saw were missing from Arthur\nCollier\u2019s anticipation of the first two antinomies), and that\nsince space and time as forms of intuition are indefinitely\nextendable and divisible, both sides of the debates, the theses and\nthe antitheses, are false: space and time and thus the totality of\nthings and events in them (the world) are neither bounded and finite\nor unbounded and infinite but indefinite (even though particular\nthings within space or periods within time may have determinate\nboundaries). In the case of the third and fourth antinomies, however,\nKant argues that the distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves that is at the heart of transcendental idealism makes it\npossible for both sides to be considered true, since they concern\ndifferent objects: in the empirical world of experience, there are\nonly ever indefinitely extending chains of causes and effects, each\nmoment of which is necessary relative to its causal laws (the third\nantithesis) but contingent because no antecedent cause is absolutely\nnecessary or necessary considered in itself, but outside of the\nempirical world there is nothing to prevent there being an absolutely\nnecessary thing in itself (God) nor acts of absolute spontaneity on\nthe part of that absolutely necessary being or even lesser beings,\nsuch as finite agents. Thus, Kant argues that the antitheses of the\nthird and fourth antinomies are actually true of the world as it\nappears, while the theses of these two antinomies are possibly true of\nthings in themselves, namely of God as the ground of the entire world\nof appearance and of ourselves as spontaneous agents grounding our own\nappearances of action. Again, Kant\u2019s ultimate claim will be that\nwe have necessary and sufficient practical grounds for\naffirming both our own freedom and the existence of God, but these do\nnot yield theoretical cognition (B xxx).\n\nKant\u2019s antinomies led to the dialectical methods of Fichte,\nSchelling, and Hegel, and were thus to prove immensely influential.\nBut it was clearly controversial whether the antinomies in fact\nrequired the distinction between appearances and things in themselves;\nHegel, for example, surely thought not. For the argument that only\ntranscendental idealism can resolve the antinomies seems to be\ncircular: unless one assumes that our representations of\nspace and time give us not only reliable but also complete information\nabout the nature of space and time and all things in them, there is no\nreason to assume that the limits of our representations of\nspace and time\u2014their indefiniteness and the contingency of any\nstarting- or stopping-point in them\u2014are also in fact true of\nspace and time and everything in them in themselves. Kant\u2019s\nindirect proof for transcendental idealism therefore is not conclusive\n(see Guyer 1987: chapter 18).\n\nKant himself did not think so, of course. He was utterly committed to\ntranscendental idealism. When confronted with the challenge that\ntranscendental idealism was nothing but Berkeleianism, however, that\nis, the reduction of all reality to ideas and the minds that have\nthem, he recoiled. This objection was made in the first substantial\nreview of the first edition of the Critique, written from an\nempiricist point of view by Christian Garve and then redacted by J.H.\nFeder in 1782 (Garve-Feder 1782, Garve 1783, in Sassen 2000,\npp. 53\u20138, 59\u201377).  Kant defended himself by a more precise\nformulation of his doctrine in the Prolegomena (1783) and\nfurther by the insertion of a \u201cRefutation of Idealism\u201d,\nspecifically \u201cmaterial idealism\u201d, into the Transcendental\nAnalytic in the second edition of the Critique\n(1787). Kant\u2019s claim in the\nProlegomena is that his position should be called\n\u201cformal\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d idealism rather than\n\u201cmaterial\u201d idealism because it merely identifies space and\ntime with our forms of intuition but does not otherwise deny the\nreality of the objects in space and time. As he puts it:\n\n\nThere are things given to us as objects of our senses existing outside\nus, yet we know nothing of them as they may be in themselves, but are\nacquainted only with their appearances, i.e., with the representations\nthat they produce in us because they affect our senses. Accordingly, I\nby all means avow that there are bodies outside us, i.e., things\nwhich, though completely unknown to us as to what they may be in\nthemselves, we know through the representations which their influence\non our sensibility provides for us, and to which we give the name of a\nbody\u2014which word therefore merely signifies the appearance of\nthis object that is unknown to us but is nonetheless real. Can this be\ncalled idealism? It is the very opposite of it. (4:288\u20139)\n\n\nAt this stage, Kant\u2019s response to the identification of his\nposition with traditional ontological idealism is basically\nincredulity: he cannot understand it because in his view he has only\ngiven reasons for removing space and time from things to our\nrepresentations of them, just as earlier philosophers had given\n(different) reasons for relocating properties like color from object\nto subject, but has provided no arguments against the existence of\nthose things themselves, which he, like any other sane person, takes\nfor granted.\n\nBy the time of the second edition of the Critique, however,\nKant must have come to see the need for a positive defense of the\nassumption of the existence of things in themselves that ground our\nspatio-temporal representations of body (although, since those things\nin themselves are not supposed to be spatio-temporal and causality is\nsupposed to be a spatio-temporal relation, they cannot precisely be\nsaid to cause our spatio-temporal representations).\nKant\u2019s argument\u2014which in the following years he would\nattempt to improve a dozen times (see Guyer 1983, Guyer 1987: Part IV, and Kant\n2005)\u2014is that we can only achieve \u201cempirically determined\nconsciousness\u201d of our own existence, or a determinate temporal\nordering of our own representations, by correlating them with\nsomething enduring outside of and distinct from them:\n\n\nThe perception of this persistent thing is possible only through a\nthing outside me and not through the mere\nrepresentation of a thing outside me. (B 275)\n\n\nSpatiality may be acknowledged to be only my way of\nrepresenting things outside me, but insofar as anything in\nspace is used to determine the order of my own representations it must\nbe regarded as being ontologically distinct from my representations of\nit even if its phenomenology is subjective, that is, even if\nspatiality is only our way of representing ontological independence\n(see A 22/B 37). In this way Kant proves, contra Berkeley who denies\nit and Descartes who doubts it, that our phenomenologically spatial\nrepresentations are \u201cgrounded\u201d in something ontologically\ndistinct from those representations. Kant\u2019s\n\u201cRefutation\u201d was intended precisely to demonstrate that\ntranscendental idealism, the argument that our most basic forms of\nknowledge in fact reflect only our own forms of intuition and\nconceptualization, could and must be combined with indeterminate\nontological realism, that is, assurance of the existence of objects\nindependent of our representations of them combined with ignorance of\ntheir nature, other than their non-spatio-temporality.\n\nIt may well be asked of Kant\u2019s \u201cRefutation of\nIdealism\u201d, as it had already been asked of his yet-to-be-named\ntranscendental idealism in 1770 by such distinguished contemporaries\nas Johann Heinrich Lambert, Johann Georg Sulzer, and Moses\nMendelssohn, whether it is really compatible with the transcendental\nideality of time, that is, whether it does not presuppose the\nreality of the temporality of the enduring object it proposes by means\nof which to determine the sequence of our own representations as well\nas of the self that has that sequence of representations (isn\u2019t\nthe sequence of representations, they essentially asked, really a\nsequence?). But we will not further pursue that question here, because\nall of Kant\u2019s successors were more concerned with the viability\nof Kant\u2019s general distinction between appearances and things in\nthemselves rather than with the specifics of Kant\u2019s argument for\ntranscendental idealism from a priori knowledge or of\nKant\u2019s proof that we can assert the existence of things in\nthemselves in spite of that distinction. This concern began with the\nfamous objection of F.H. Jacobi, made in the appendix to his 1787 book\non David Hume, that without the assumption of things in themselves he\ncould not enter into the critical system, but that with it he could\nnot remain within the system; that is, he felt that once the\ndistinction between appearances and things in themselves was made all\nground for the assumption of the existence of things other than our\nown representations was removed even if Kant had made no explicit\nargument against that existence. We will also not further explore what\nwe have called Kant\u2019s practical transcendental realism, that is,\nhis argument that morality requires us to believe that we have free\nwills and immortal souls and that there is an omniscient,\nomni-benevolent, and all-wise God, thus that those constituents of\nreality are essentially mental in nature. Rather, we now turn to\nKant\u2019s successors to see how they tried to save Kant\u2019s\ninsight into the idea that the most fundamental forms of knowledge\nultimately depend on fundamental operations of self-consciousness\nwithout ending up with Kant\u2019s combination of that with\nindeterminate ontological realism.\n",
