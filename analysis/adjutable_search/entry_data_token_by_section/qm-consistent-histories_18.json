    "main_text": "Measurement and Preparation || Preparation and wave function collapse\n7.3 Preparation and wave function collapse\nThe reader may have noticed that the particle states \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) in\n\\eqref{eqn19} played no role in our discussion of measurement\nin subsection 7.2. Von Neumann\u2019s\noriginal (1932: sec. VI.3) presentation\nused \\(\\ket{w^j}=\\ket{s^j}\\), as he thought it important that a second\nmeasurement could confirm the first. This practice was followed in\nlater textbooks, and has resulted in some confusion. The \\(\\ket{w^j}\\)\nare in fact irrelevant when considering measurements, but they are\nuseful when considering a preparation procedure in which\nmacroscopic apparatus is used to produce a quantum system\u2014again\nwe shall speak of it as a particle\u2014in some well-defined\nstate. To see how this works let us again employ the model\nof subsection 7.1 with unitary development given\nby \\eqref{eqn19}, but now introduce a family\n\\[\\FC_p:\\;\\;[\\Psi_0]\\;\\odot\\;[\\Psi_1] \\;\\odot\\;\n\\{[v^l]\\otimes[m^j]\\} \\label{eqn27}\\]\nthat is a refinement of \\(\\FC_1\\) in \\eqref{eqn22}, with \\(I_s\\)\nreplaced by a projective decomposition onto some orthonormal basis\n\\(\\{\\ket{v^j}\\}\\) of the particle Hilbert space \\(\\HC_s\\). The joint\nprobability distribution at time \\(t_2\\) of the particle and pointer\nstates is then\n\n\\[\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{eqn28}\n\\Pr([m^j],[v^l]) &= \\mte{\\Psi_2}{[v^l]\\otimes[m^j]} \\\\\n   &= |c_j|^2 \\mte{w^j}{[v^l]}  \\nonumber \\\\\n   &= |c_j|^2 |\\inpd{v^l}{w^j}|^2. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\Pr([m^j]) = |c_j|^2\\), \\eqref{eqn25}, one obtains the\nconditional probability\n\\[\\Pr([v^l]\\boldsymbol{\\mid} [m^j]) = |\\inpd{v^l}{w^j}|^2\n\\label{eqn29}\\]\n(assuming \\(|c_j|^2\\) is not 0). That is to say, if the measurement\noutcome is known to be \\([m^j]\\), then the probability of any property\nof the particle is precisely that given by assuming the particle is in\nthe state \\(\\ket{w^j}\\), with \u201cstate\u201d having its usual\nmeaning: a pre-probability from which the probability distribution for\nthe properties represented by any projective decomposition of its\nidentity can be calculated; see subsection\n3.5.\nNote that this discussion remains valid when \\(\\{\\ket{w^j}\\}\\) is not\na collection of orthogonal states, even though this means that the\ncorresponding projectors \\(\\{[w^j]\\}\\) cannot all belong to the same\nprojective decomposition of \\(I_s\\). The point is that \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) is\nassigned to the particle only in association with the projector\n\\([m^j]\\), and the collection \\(\\{\\ket{w^j}\\otimes\\ket{m^j}\\}\\) is\northogonal. In such circumstances the \\([w^j]\\) are what in Ch. 14\nof Griffiths (2002a) are referred to\nas dependent or contextual\n(\u201cconditional\u201d would be equally good) properties:\nthey must be understood in conjunction with other properties, which in\nthis case are the pointer positions \\([m^j]\\), when forming part of a\nquantum description or history.\nWhat has here been deduced from fundamental quantum principles,\nincluding the Born rule, is in textbooks stated as a mysterious and\nseparate principle of \u201cwave function collapse\u201d: if the\nmeasurement outcome is \\([m^j]\\) then the particle state\n\u201ccollapses\u201d onto a particular state associated with this\noutcome. To make closer contact with textbook discussions of this\ntopic, let\n\\[S = \\sum_j \\sigma_j [s^j] \\label{eqn30}\\]\nbe a Hermitian operator with nondegenerate eigenvalues \\(\\sigma_j\\),\nand let \\(\\ket{w^j}=\\ket{s^j}\\). Then the measurement outcome \\([m^j]\\)\ncorresponds to measuring the eigenvalue \\(\\sigma_j\\)\u2014see the\nremarks in subsection 3.3\u2014and\n\\eqref{eqn29} and the remarks following it justify assigning to the\nparticle at time \\(t_2\\) the ket \\(\\ket{w^j}=\\ket{s^j}\\). One may add that\nthe more general form of wave function collapse embodied in the\nL\u00fcder\u2019s rule (Busch & Lahti 2009) is\nlikewise a consequence of the general quantum principles governing\nstochastic time development set forth in section\n4, so need not be added as an additional hypothesis.\n\nIn any case there is no need to set \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) equal to\n\\(\\ket{s^j}\\) in order to discuss quantum measurements, and a better\nway of viewing the family \\(\\FC_p\\) in \\eqref{eqn27} is as a model of\na quantum preparation process in which the macroscopic pointer\nposition tells one the future rather than the past state of the\nparticle. The conditional probability in \\eqref{eqn29} refers\nspecifically to properties at the time \\(t_2\\), but given the\nassumption that \\(T(t',t)\\) is trivial for times after \\(t_2\\), the\nargument leading to \\eqref{eqn29} is easily extended to \\([v^l]\\) and\n\\([m^j]\\) at any times (not necessarily the same) later than \\(t_2\\).\nIn general the outcome \\([m^j]\\) is random, and if the wrong \\(j\\)\noccurs \\(\\ket{w^j}\\) may not be the desired state.  But then the\npreparer can throw the particle away (run it into a baffle) and repeat\nthe experiment until the desired outcome occurs. There are more\nsophisticated ways to do preparations, but our model illustrates the\ngeneral idea, and in fact discarding unwanted outcomes is a procedure\noften used in quantum optics.  The essential point is that an\napparatus can be constructed using quantum principles to prepare a\nparticle whose future state is known on the basis of macroscopic\n(pointer) information.\n",
