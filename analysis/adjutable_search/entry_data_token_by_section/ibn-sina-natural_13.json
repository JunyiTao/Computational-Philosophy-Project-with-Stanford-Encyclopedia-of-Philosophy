    "main_text": "Conditions for Motion || Place and Void\n4.1 Place and Void\n\nAn account of place is particularly significant given that motion with\nrespect to place was frequently viewed as the primary species of\nmotion (although Avicenna would rank positional motion along side\nlocal motion, if not above it). The reason for giving priority to\nplace or position is that change in quantity involves the increase or\ndecrease of the place that a body occupies; and change in\nquality involves a body\u2019s coming into proximity with some cause\nthat brings about the alteration, where \u201ccoming into\nproximity\u201d refers to a change of place either in the\nbody or in the cause (Avicenna, [Ph], 4.9).\n\nAs noted when discussing positional motion, Avicenna follows the\nAristotelian tradition and identifies the technical definition of\nplace (Gk. topos, Ar. mak\u0101n) with \u201cthe\nsurface that is the extremity of the containing body\u201d (Avicenna,\n[Ph], 2.9 [1]). The general structure of his argumentation for this\nthesis involves showing that all other candidates for what place might\nbe are wanting in some way. To this end, Avicenna provides us with, as\nit were, the logical space for an account of place (Avicenna, [Ph],\n2.6 [2]). Place can be either intrinsic or extrinsic to body, that is,\nessential or accidental to it. If place is intrinsic to a body, then\nit is either (1) the matter or (2) the form of the body, whereas if it\nis extrinsic, then the place is either (3) what the body exactly\nencompasses, that is, an interval (bu\u02bfd) or (4) what\nexactly encompasses the body, that is, the surface that is the\nextremity of the containing\n body.[10]\n Avicenna quickly eliminates (1) and (2). That is because a body can\nchange with respect to place, that is, depart from one place to\nanother, whereas a body cannot depart from either its matter or form\nwithout undergoing generation and corruption. Hence only (3) and (4)\nare truly live options. Account (4) is just the Aristotelian one,\nwhich Avicenna himself prefers. As for (3), namely that a body\u2019s\nplace is the interval it occupies, Avicenna believes that it\nultimately stands or falls with whether a void\n(khal\u0101\u02be), an empty interval, is possible. Avicenna\ndedicates a long chapter (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.8) to showing that a void\nis impossible. If his argument there is successful, then (4), namely,\nplace is the innermost limit of the containing body, remains the only\nviable definition of place.\n\nAristotle before Avicenna had also dedicated a long section of his\nPhysics (4.6\u20139) to a refutation of the void.\nAristotle\u2019s arguments might all best be described as physical\nones inasmuch as they all appeal to physical concerns associated with\nthe void. More specifically, Aristotle\u2019s arguments attempt to\nshow that motion would be impossible on the assumption of a void.\nAvicenna reproduces many of Aristotle\u2019s physical arguments,\noften giving them his own unique twist. Additionally, however,\nAvicenna develops what might be called a conceptual critique of the\nnotion of void. In this critique, Avicenna attempts to show that the\nvery idea of a void is conceptually vacuous or a vain intelligible.\nThe criticism begins with a logical/physical principle: Anything that\nactually exists within the natural order can be defined in terms of a\ngenus and difference. (The general idea is that the things that make\nup the physical world must be of some kind or species if they exist at\nall, and it is the genus and difference that identify the kind or\nspecies.) He then adds one further qualification: Inasmuch as these\nactual existents positively make up the world around us, their genus\nand difference must refer to positive (as opposed to negative)\nnotions; a species properly understood answers the question\n\u201cwhat is it?\u201d and a genus or difference given in\nnegative terms simply would not tell us what something is,\nbut what it is not. (For a discussion of Avicenna\u2019s\ntheory of genus and difference and how it relates to his criticism of\nthe void see McGinnis 2007b.)\n\nWith these preliminaries in place, Avicenna\u2019s conceptual\ncritique begins (Avicenna, [Ph], 2.8 [1\u20134]; also see McGinnis\n2007a, 2007b; and Lammer 2018, \u00a75.3). He first asks whether the\nvoid actually exists or is absolutely nothing. If one says that the\nvoid is absolutely nothing, Avicenna happily agrees; for if it is\nabsolutely nothing, then it does not actually exist. Those who affirm\nthat the void actually exists, then, cannot simply say that it is\nnothing, but must provide some positive features about it. Avicenna\nnext notes that void space is frequently described as being of either\na greater or lesser extent, for the void space between two cities on\nEarth, for example, is less than the void space between the Earth and\nthe heavens. This property of being more or less is none other than\nthat of quantity. Thus if a void should exist, it would possess some\nquantity either essentially or accidentally. If quantity belongs to\nvoid accidentally, and every accident must belong to a substance, then\nvoid is joined to a substance possessing quantity. The quantity in\nquestion is necessarily three-dimensional, but as noted when\ndiscussing continuity, three-dimensionality follows upon the form of\ncorporeality. The form of corporeality, however, causes the existence\nof a body. Thus void would belong to a body as an accidental feature\nof it, a seeming contradiction.\n\nIn contrast, if the quantity is not accidental to the void but is\nessential to it, then void would be a species of quantity. Avicenna\nnow challenges the defenders of void to provide some positive\ndifference that would make up void\u2019s species. It cannot be that\nvoid is a material quantity, since again a material quantity is body.\nIf one claims that void is immaterial quantity, Avicenna demands some\nnon-negative difference, for while there are immaterial substances,\nlike angels, one can provide a positive characterization of them as\nintellectual substances. Avicenna offers a number of\nsuggestions, but finds every attempt wanting or ultimately telling us\nwhat void is not rather than what it is. Since no definition of void\ncan be given in terms of a positive genus and difference, Avicenna\nconcludes that our idea of void is nothing but empty imaginings.\n\nAgain, place had to be either (1) the matter or (2) the form of the\nbody, or either (3) what the body exactly encompasses or (4) what\nexactly encompasses the body (i.e., the surface that is the innermost\nextremity of the containing body). As noted (1) and (2) are\nnon-starters, and as just argued, (3) involves a conceptual confusion.\nConsequently, Avicenna concludes place must be the innermost surface\nof the surrounding body.\n",
