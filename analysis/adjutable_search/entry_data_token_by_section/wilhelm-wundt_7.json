V\u00f6lkerpsychologie\n\nWhereas experimental psychology focuses in the first place on the\neffects of the physical (outer) upon the psychic (inner), the willing\nconsciousness is characterized by intervening in the external world,\nthat is, by expressing the internal (PP I:\n2). This latter feature of consciousness lies beyond the scope of\nexperiment, because the origins of conscious expression cannot be\ncontrolled. Moreover, psychological development is obviously not\ndetermined merely by sensation, but also by the meaningful influences\nof the individual\u2019s \u201cspiritual [geistig]\nenvironment\u201d\u2014his culture\u2014influences again not\nobviously susceptible to\n experimentation.[43]\n Hence, just as Wundt reserved for physiology an ancillary role in\nexperimental psychology, so too he now argues for the utility of a\ndistinct methodological approach to analyze and explain the\n\n\npsychic processes that are bound, in virtue of their genetic and\ndevelopmental conditions, to spiritual communities [geistige\nGemeinschaften]. (L III: 224)\n\n\nIt is the inquiry into \u201ccultural products\n[Erzeugnisse]\u201d of the \u201ctotality of spiritual life\n[geistiges Gesammtleben] in which certain psychological laws\nhave embodied themselves\u201d, specifically, language, art, myth,\nand customs (Sitten) (PP I: 5; L III: 230).\nThese objects cannot be investigated in the same way as those of\nindividual \u201cinner\u201d experience, but require a mode of\nexplanation appropriate to their external, yet non-physical\nphenomenology. This inquiry, which complements and together with\nexperimental psychology completes the discipline of psychology, Wundt\ncalls \u201cV\u00f6lkerpsychologie\u201d (hereafter\nabbreviated: VP) (L III:\n 225).[44]\n\nWhile Wundt had already discussed the role of a VP necessary\nfor the completion of psychology in his early writings, it was not\nuntil old age that he committed himself to its realization. The result\nwas his ten-volume work, entitled V\u00f6lkerpsychologie.\nWhile an examination of the contents of these tomes lies beyond the\nscope of this article, his justification and clarification of the\nv\u00f6lkerpsychologisch project as such are of interest for\nthose interested in truth and method in the social and human sciences.\nWundt stresses that although VP shares object-domains with\nsuch sciences as history, philology,\n linguistics,[45]\n ethnology,[46] or anthropology (L III:\n226), yet it is only interested in these domains insofar as they\n\u201care determined by general psychological laws, and not just by\nhistorical conditions\u201d (PP I: 5). In other words,\nVP is not interested in the unique and specific facts of this\nnation\u2019s history or that tribe\u2019s language as such, but\nonly insofar as these reveal \u201cthe general psychological\ndevelopments that arise from the connection of individual\n[developments]\u201d (L III: 226). This quotation is\nimportant. While VP does not concern itself with historical\nor linguistic facts as such, this does not mean that it is not\nconcerned with individuality. Indeed, it is through the study of the\npsychological motives only apparent in history or language\u2014i.e.,\nin communal existence\u2014that our understanding of the\nindividual is completed (cf. L III: 224, 228). This\nview is typical of Wundt\u2019s perspectivism. Just as psychology is\nan alternative perspective to that of physiology, so too\n(within psychology) VP provides an alternative\nperspective to that of experimental psychology. Wundt considers none\nof these various perspectives dispensable, since each one is a\ncomplement necessary for total science. But while each of these\nperspectives reveals a (phenomenologically) irreducible\n(\u201cparallel\u201d) network of causal chains, the\nprocess so explained, Wundt holds, is in every case one and\nthe same. There is just one empirical world and reality, but\nmany irreducible varieties of experience. Thus, in the case of\nVP, too, he claims that there is no \u201cgeneral law of\nspiritual events [geistiges Geschehen] that is not already\ncompletely contained in the laws of the individual\nconsciousness\u201d (L III: 225).\n",
