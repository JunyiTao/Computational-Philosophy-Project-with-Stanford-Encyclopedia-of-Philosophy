Common Interests (ii): Private Individuality\n\nPrivate individuality conceptions offer a different account of the\nprivileged class of common interests. According to these views,\nmembers of a political community have a relational obligation to care\nabout their common interest in being able to lead lives as private\nindividuals. Citizens each have an interest in being able to shape\ntheir lives through their own private choices about what activities to\npursue and what associations to form. Choices are\n\u201cprivate\u201d in the relevant sense when citizens are not\nrequired to consult with anyone in making these choices and they are\nnot required to reach a decision through any form of shared\ndeliberation.[15] \nAmong the philosophers who endorse this kind\nof view are many important thinkers in the liberal tradition,\nincluding John Locke (1698), J.J. Rousseau (1762b), Adam Smith (1776),\nand G.W.F. Hegel (1821). More recent figures who endorse this kind of\nview include John Rawls (1971) and Michael Walzer (1983).\n\nA sophisticated example of a private individuality conception is\nRawls\u2019s. On Rawls\u2019s view, members of a political community\nhave a relational obligation to care for the interests attached to the\n\u201cposition of equal citizenship\u201d which all citizens share\n(1971 [1999: 82\u201383]). These interests are (a) the interest in a\nfully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties and (b) the interest in\na fair opportunity to reach the more attractive positions in society.\nRawls uses the term \u201cthe common good\u201d to refer to the sum\ntotal of social conditions that answer to the interests attached to\nthe position of equal citizenship (1971 [1999: 217]). Understood in\nthis way, the common good consists, inter alia, of: a legal\norder that provides citizens with the liberty of expression, the\nliberty of conscience and the other liberal freedoms; a democratic\nsystem of government that provides citizens with political liberties,\nsuch as the liberty to vote, hold office and participate in collective\nrule-making; a system of courts to enforce the rule of law; as well as\npolice protection and national defense to protect the basic liberties.\nThe common good also consists of legal protections for free choice of\noccupation; mass media mechanisms that gather and disperse information\nabout job possibilities; a transportation system to give people access\nto work; and a system of education (whether public or private) that\nensures conditions in which people with similar talents and\nmotivations have similar prospects, regardless of their class or\nfamily background.\n\nRawls\u2019s conception has the core features of a private\nindividuality view. The facilities that answer to the common interest\nin equal liberty and fair opportunity put citizens in a position to\njoin or withdraw from various activities and associations as private\npersons who can make their own independent choices. For example, the\nliberty of conscience gives citizens the legal right to join or leave\na religious association based on their own private beliefs. They need\nnot consult with other citizens about these choices or make these\nchoices as part of a wider deliberative process that involves other\ncitizens.\n\nRawls\u2019s view takes the common good to consist partly in a system\nof bodily security, private property and civil liberty. In this way,\nhis view resembles Rousseau\u2019s, which also focuses on these\ncommon interests. Where Rawls\u2019s view differs from\nRousseau\u2019s is that it extends the privileged class of common\ninterests to include an interest in a wider set of basic liberties and\nan interest in a fair opportunity to reach the more attractive\npositions in society. These interests involve a more extensive array\nof institutions and social conditions, especially when it comes to\neducation, communication, and economic redistribution. But it is worth\nemphasizing that neither Rawls nor Rousseau incorporates a full\naccount of distributive justice into their conceptions of the common\ngood.[16] I\nwill say more about this in the next section.\n",
