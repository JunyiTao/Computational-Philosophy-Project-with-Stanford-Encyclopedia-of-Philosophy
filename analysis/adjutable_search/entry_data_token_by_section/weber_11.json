    "main_text": "Knowledge || Understanding (Verstehen)\n5.1 Understanding (Verstehen)\n\nBuilding on the Neo-Kantian nominalism outlined above [2.1], thus,\nWeber\u2019s contribution to methodology turned mostly on the\nquestion of objectivity and the role of subjective values in\nhistorical and cultural concept formation. On the one hand, he\nfollowed Windelband in positing that historical and cultural knowledge\nis categorically distinct from natural scientific knowledge. Action\nthat is the subject of any social scientific inquiry is clearly\ndifferent from mere behaviour. While behaviour can be accounted for\nwithout reference to inner motives and thus can be reduced to mere\naggregate numbers, making it possible to establish positivistic\nregularities, and even laws, of collective behaviour, an action can\nonly be interpreted because it is based on a radically subjective\nattribution of meaning and values to what one does. What a social\nscientist seeks to understand is this subjective dimension of human\nconduct as it relates to others. On the other hand, an\nunderstanding(Verstehen) in this subjective sense is not\nanchored in a non-cognitive empathy or intuitive appreciation that is\narational by nature; it can gain objective validity when the meanings\nand values to be comprehended are explained causally, that is, as a\nmeans to an end. A teleological contextualization of an action in the\nmeans-end nexus is indeed the precondition for a causal explanation\nthat can be objectively ascertained. So far, Weber is not essentially\nin disagreement with Rickert.\n\nFrom Weber\u2019s perspective, however, the problem that\nRickert\u2019s formulation raised was the objectivity of the end to\nwhich an action is held to be oriented. As pointed out [2.1 above],\nRickert in the end had to rely on a certain transhistorical,\ntranscultural criterion in order to account for the purpose of an\naction, an assumption that cannot be warranted in Weber\u2019s view.\nTo be consistent with the Neo-Kantian presuppositions, instead, the\nends themselves have to be conceived of as no less subjective.\nImputing an end to an action is of a fictional nature in the sense\nthat it is not free from the subjective value-judgment that conditions\nthe researcher\u2019s thematization of a certain subject matter out\nof \u201can infinite multiplicity of successively and coexistently\nemerging and disappearing events\u201d [Weber 1904/1949, 72].\nAlthough a counterfactual analysis might aid in stabilizing the\nprocess of causal imputation, it cannot do away completely with the\nsubjective nature of the researcher\u2019s perspective.\n\nIn the end, the kind of objective knowledge that historical and\ncultural sciences may achieve is precariously limited. An action can\nbe interpreted with objective validity only at the level of means, not\nends. An end, however, even a \u201cself-evident\u201d one, is\nirreducibly subjective, thus defying an objective understanding; it\ncan only be reconstructed conceptually based on a researcher\u2019s\nno less subjective values. Objectivity in historical and social\nsciences is, then, not a goal that can be reached with the aid of a\ncorrect method, but an ideal that must be striven for without a\npromise of ultimate fulfillment. In this sense, one might say that the\nso-called \u201cvalue-freedom\u201d (Wertfreiheit) is as\nmuch a methodological principle for Weber as an ethical virtue that a\npersonality fit for modern science must possess.\n",
