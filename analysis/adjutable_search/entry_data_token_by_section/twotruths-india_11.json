His chief reason for doing this is his\ndeep mistrust of the varying degrees of metaphysical and\nepistemological foundationalism that these theories are committed to.\nFor example Candrak\u012brti rejects Bh\u0101vavevika\u2019s reading of\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s theory of the two truths and explicitly\nvindicates Buddhap\u0101lita\u2019s Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika approach to\nunderstanding N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s Madhyamaka. He does this by\ndemonstrating the groundlessness of the fallacies Bh\u0101vavevika\nattributed to Buddhap\u0101lita, and thereby rejecting\nBh\u0101vavevika\u2019s admission and imposition upon N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s\nnon-foundationalist ontology of a kind of independent formal\nsv\u0101tantra argument, which Candrak\u012brti saw as one encumbered\nby foundationalist metaphysics, and is incompatible with\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s ontology. Instead of relying on the two truths\ntheories of other schools, Candrak\u012brti proposes a distinctive\nnon-foundationalist theory of the two truths in the Madhyamaka, and he\ndefends it against his foundationalist opponents. This school later\ncame to be known as the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka.\n\nAt the core of the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory of the two truths\nare these two fundamental theses:\n\nOnly what is conventionally non-intrinsic is causally\neffective, for only those phenomena, the conventional nature of which\nis non-intrinsically real, are subject to conditioned or dependent\narising. Conventional reality (or dependently arisen phenomenon),\ngiven it is causally effective, is therefore always\nintrinsically unreal. Hence that which is conventionally (or\ndependently) coarisen is always conventionally (or dependently)\narisen.\nOnly what is ultimately non-intrinsic is causally\neffective, for only those phenomena, the ultimate nature of which is\nnon-intrinsically real, are subject to conditioned arising. Ultimate\ntruth (or emptiness), given it is causally effective, is therefore\nintrinsically unreal. Hence ultimate truth is ultimately unreal (or\nemptiness is always empty).\n\n\nAlthough these two theses are advanced separately, they are mutually\ncoextensive. There is a compatible relationship between conventional\ntruth and ultimate truth, hence between dependent arising\n(prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da / rten \u2018brel) and emptiness\n(\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 / stong pa nyid), and there is no tension\nbetween the two. We shall examine the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika arguments\nin defence of these theses.\n4.2.1 Conventional Truth\n\nLet us turn to the first thesis. Earlier we saw that both the\nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and Sautr\u0101ntika argue that only\nultimately intrinsic reality (svabh\u0101va) enables things\nto perform a causal function (arthakriya). The Sv\u0101tantrika\nMadhyamaka rejects this, and it instead argues that things are\ncausally efficient because of their conventionally intrinsic\nreality (svabh\u0101va) or unique particularity\n(svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a). The Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika Madhyamaka,\nhowever, rejects both these positions, and argues only what is\nconventionally non-intrinsic reality (ni\u1e25svabh\u0101va)\nis causally effective, for only those phenomena, the conventional\nnature of which is non-intrinsic, are subject to conditioned or\ndependent arising. Conventional reality (here treated as dependently\narisen phenomenon), given it is causally effective, is therefore\nalways intrinsically unreal, and hence lacks any intrinsic\nreality even conventionally. Hence that which is conventionally (or\ndependently) coarisen is always conventionally (or dependently) arisen\nand strictly does not arise ultimately.\n\nIn his etymological analysis of the term \u201cconvention\u201d\n(sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti / kun rdzob) in [PP] Candrak\u012brti attributes\nthree senses to the term convention:\n\nconfusion (avidy\u0101 / mi shes pa) for it obstructs the mundane\ncognitive processes of the ordinary beings from seeing the reality as\nit is by way of concealing (sa\u1e43v\u1e5bti / kun\nrdzob) its nature;\ncodependent (paraparasa\u1e43bhavana / phan tshun brtan\npa) for it is an interdependent phenomenon; and\nSignifier (sa\u1e41ket / rda) or worldly convention\n(lokavyavah\u0101ra / \u2018jig rten tha snyad) in the sense of\ndependently designated by means of expression and expressed,\nconsciousness and object of consciousness, etc ([PP] 24.8 Dbu\nma \u2018a 163a).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s claims that in the case of mundane cognitive\nprocesses of the ordinary beings, the first sense of convention\neclipses the force of the second and the third senses. As a result,\nfar from understanding things as dependently arisen (the second sense)\nand dependently designated (the third sense), ordinary beings reify\nthem to be non-dependently arisen, and non-designated. Due to the\nforce of this cognitive confusion, from the perspective of mundane\ncognitive processes of the ordinary beings, things appear real, and\neach phenomenon appears intrinsically real in spite of their\nnon-intrinsic nature. Consequently this confusion, according to\nCandrak\u012brti, defines epistemic practices of the ordinary beings.\nFor this reason, the epistemic norms or the standard set by\nmundane convention of the ordinary beings, is poles apart\nfrom the epistemic norms set by mundane convention of the noble beings\n(\u0101ryas / \u2018phags pa) whose mundane cognitive processes are\nnot under the sway of afflictive confusion.\n\nIn order to illustrate this distinction, in his commentary [MBh] 6.28\nCandrak\u012brti introduces the concept: mere convention (kun\nrdzob tsam) of the noble beings to contrast with conventionally\nreal or conventional true (kun rdzob bden pa) of the\nordinary beings. Ordinary beings erroneously grasp all conditioned\nphenomena as intrinsically real, therefore things are\nconventionally real and thus are categories of conventional\ntruth. For noble beings, however, because they no longer reify them as\nreal, things are perceived as having the nature of being\ncreated (bcos ma) and unreal (bden pa ma yin pa)\nlike the reflected image ([MBh] 6.28 Dbu ma \u2018a\n255a).\n\nAccording to Candrak\u0131rti\u2019s definition of the two truths, all\nthings embody dual nature, for each is constituted by its conventional\nnature and its ultimate nature. Consequently, all entities, according\nto this definition, satisfy the criterion of the two truths, for the\ndefinition of the two truths is one based on the two natures. The two\ntruths are, therefore, not merely one specific nature\nmirrored in two different perspectives ([MBh] 6.23 Dbu ma\n\u2018a 253a). Conventional nature entails conventional truth and\nultimate nature entails ultimate truth, and given each entity is\nconstituted by the two natures, the two truths define what each entity\nis in its ontological and epistemological terms.\n\nConventional nature is defined as conventional truth because it is the\ndomain of mundane cognitive process, and is readily accessible for\nordinary beings, including mundane cognitive process of noble beings.\nIt is a sort of truth, while unreal and illusory in\nreality, it is yet erroneously and non-analytically taken for granted\nby mundane cognitive processes of the ordinary beings. Ultimate\nnature, on the other hand, is defined as ultimate truth because it is\ndomain of the exalted cognitive process which engages with its object\nanalytically, one that is directly accessible for noble beings\n(\u0101ryas) and only inferentially accessible for ordinary beings. It\nis this sort of truth, both real and non-illusory, that is\ncorrectly and directly found out by exalted cognitive processes of\nnoble beings, and by analytic cognitive processes of ordinary\nbeings.\n\nMundane cognitive process that is associated with the definition of\nconventional truth and therefore allied to the perception of\nunreal entities is of two kinds ([M] 6.24 Dbu ma\n\u2018a 205a):\n\ncorrect cognitive process, and\nfallacious cognitive process.\n\n\nCorrect cognitive process is associated with an acute sense faculty,\nwhich is not impaired by any occasional extraneous causes of\nmisperception (see below). Fallacious cognitive process is associated\nwith a defective sense faculty impaired by occasional extraneous\ncauses of misperception. In [PP] Candrak\u012brti introduces us to a\nsimilar epistemic distinction:\n\nmundane convention (lokasa\u1e43v\u1e5bti /\n\u2018jig rten gyi kun rdzob) and\nnon-mundane convention (alokasa\u1e43v\u1e5bti /\u2018jig\nrten ma yin pa\u2019i kun rdzo).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s key argument behind to support the distinction\nbetween two mundane epistemic practices\u2014one mundane\nconvention and the other non-mundane convention\u2014is that\nthe former is, for mundane standard, epistemically reliable whereas\nthe latter is epistemically unreliable. Consequently correct cognitive\nprocesses of both ordinary and awakened beings satisfy the epistemic\nstandard of mundane convention, being non-deceptive by\nmundane standard, thus they set the standard of mundane convention;\nwhereas fallacious cognitive processes of defective sense faculties,\nof both ordinary and awakened beings, do not satisfy the epistemic\nstandard of mundane convention, and therefore, they are\ndeceptive even by mundane standard. They are thus\n\u201cnon-mundane convention\u201d as Candrak\u012brti characterises\nthem in [PP] 24.8 (Dbu ma \u2018a 163ab).\n\nJust as they are two kinds of sensory faculty\u2014nonerroneous and\nerroneous\u2014their objects are, according to Candrak\u012brti, of\ntwo corresponding kinds:\n\nconventionally real and\nconventionally unreal.\n\n\nFirst, cognitive processes associated with sense faculties that are\nunimpaired by extraneous causes of misperception grasp the former\nobjects, and because this kind of object fulfils realistic mundane\nontological standard, it is thus real for ordinary beings,\n(not so for the noble beings the issue to which we turn later). Hence\nit is only conventionally real.\n\nSecond, cognitive processes associated with sense faculties that are\nimpaired by extraneous causes of misperception grasp conventionally\nunreal objects, and because this kind of object does not meet\nrealistic mundane ontological standard, they are thus\nconventionally unreal.\n\nAlthough Candrak\u012brti recognises that conventional reality\nsatisfies the ontological standard of ordinary beings, he,\nimportantly, argues that it does not satisfy the ontological criterion\nof the Madhyamaka (here synonymous for noble beings). Just as illusion\nis partly real although partly unreal, all objects\nthat are considered commonsensically as conventionally real, are\nunreal. The major difference between the two is that a\nknowledge of illusion being unreal is available to mundane cognitive\nprocesses of ordinary beings where as a knowledge of unreality of\nconventionally real entities is not available to mundane cognitive\nprocesses of ordinary beings.\n\nHowever, for Candrak\u012brti illusory objects are\nconventionally real and causally efficient, and that the\nconventionally real entities themselves are illusion-like.\nCandrak\u012brti develops this argument using the two tier theory of\nillusion.\n\nThe argument from the first tier of the theory of illusion\ndemonstrates a causal efficiency of conventionally illusory objects.\nThis, Candrak\u012brti does by identifying conventionally\nillusory entities with the so-called conventionally real\nentities.\nThe argument from the second tier of the theory of illusion\ndemonstrates an illusory nature of conventionally\nreal entities. This, Candrak\u012brti does by means of showing\nthat entities that are conventionally real are conventionally\nempty of intrinsic reality, and by denying conventional\nreality the ontological status of the so-called intrinsic\nreality.\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti support his argument from the theory of illusion by\nmeans of applying four categories of the conventional entities:\n\nPartly unreal entities\u2014illusory objects (e.g. mirage,\nreflection, echoe etc.);\nPartly real entities\u2014non-illusory objects (e.g. water, face,\nsound etc.);\nIntrinsic reality (e.g. substance, essence, intrinsic nature\netc.,) and\nConventionally unreal entities (e.g. the rabbit\u2019s horn, the\nsky-flower etc). ([MBh] 6.28 Dbu ma \u2018a\n254b\u2013255a).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti accepts conventional reality of both\nentities\u2014partly unreal (i) and partly real (ii)\u2014on the\nground that they both appear in mundane cognitive processes who are\nconfused about their ultimate ontological status. Candrak\u012brti\nrejects conventional reality status of those entities that are\nsupposedly intrinsically real (iii) and conventionally unreal (iv),\nalthough for different reasons. Conventional reality of intrinsically\nreal entity is rejected in [MBh] 6.28 on the ground that its existence\ndoes not, forever, appear to a mundane cognitive processes.\n\nCandrak\u012brti argues that there is a critical epistemic\ndifferentiation to be made between the two\nentities\u2014conventionally real and conventionally illusory.\nDeceptive, unreal, and dependently arisen nature of conventionally\nreal entities is beyond the grasp of mundane cognitive processes. By\ncontrast, deceptive, unreal and dependently arisen nature of\nconventionally illusory, partly unreal, entities is grasped by mundane\ncognitive processes. Therefore illusory objects are regarded as\ndeceptive, and unreal by the standard of mundane knowledge, whereas,\nconventionally real things are regarded as nondeceptive and real by\nthe standard of mundane knowledge.\n\nSo the argument from the first tier of the illusory theory shows that\nmundane cognitive processes of ordinary beings fail to know\nillusory and unreal nature of conventionally real entities, they\ninstead grasp them to be intrinsically real. The argument from the\nsecond tier of the illusory theory offers Candrak\u012brti\u2019s reason\nwhy this is so. Here, he argues, the presence of the underlying\nconfusion operating beneath mundane cognitive processes of the\nordinary beings is the force by which ordinary beings intuitively and\nerroneously reify the nature of conventional entities. Hence they grasp\nconventional entities as intrinsically real, although they are in\nactual fact on a closer analysis, only non-intrinsic, unreal or\nillusory.\n\nTherefore intrinsic reality is not a conventional reality and grasping\nthings to be intrinsically real is only a confused belief, not a\nknowledge. Hence Candrak\u012brti clearly excludes it from the\nontological categories of conventional reality, for the reason that\nintrinsic reality is a conceptual fiction fabricated by confused minds\nof the ordinary beings and that it is a conceptual construct thrust\nupon non-intrinsic entities ([MBh] 6.28 Dbu ma \u2018a\n255a). In addition Candrak\u012brti argues that if things were\nintrinsically real, even conventionally, as the Sv\u0101tantrikas take\nthem to be, in Candrak\u012brti\u2019s view, things would exist by virtue\nof their intrinsic reality, at least conventionally. If this\nwere the case then intrinsic reality would become the ultimate nature\nof things. That would be absurd.\n\nFor M\u0101dhyamikas, things cannot have more than one final mode of\nexistence\u2014if they exist, they must exist qua only\nconventionally. Consequently, given the mutually exclusive relation of\nintrinsic reality and emptiness, if intrinsic reality is granted even\na conventional reality status, Candrak\u012brti contends, one has to\nreject emptiness as the ultimate reality ([M] 6.34, DBu ma\n\u2018a 205b). But since the M\u0101dhyamika asserts emptiness to be\nthe ultimate reality, and given that emptiness and intrinsic reality\nare mutually exclusive, M\u0101dhyamika must reject intrinsic reality\nin all its forms\u2014conventionally as well as ultimately ([MBh]\n6.36, 1994: 118).\n4.2.2 Ultimate truth\n\nWe now turn to Candrak\u012brti\u2019s second thesis\u2014namely, only\nwhat is ultimately non-intrinsic is causally effective, for\nonly those phenomena, an ultimate nature of which is non-intrinsic,\nare subject to conditioned arising. Ultimate reality (or emptiness),\ngiven it is causally effective, is therefore intrinsically unreal.\nTherefore ultimate reality is ultimately unreal (or put it\ndifferently, emptiness is ultimately empty).\n\nCandrak\u012brti defines ultimate reality as the nature of things\nfound by the perception of reality ([M] 6.23 Dbu ma \u2018a\n205a). In the commentary Candrak\u012brti expands this definition.\n\u201cUltimate is the object, the nature of which is found by\nparticular exalted cognitive processes (yishes) of those who\nperceive reality. But it does not exist by virtue of its intrinsic\nobjective reality (svar\u016bpat\u0101 / bdag gi ngo bo\nnyid).\u201d ([MBh] 6.23 Dbu ma \u2018a 253a) Of the two\nnatures, the object of the perception of reality is the way things\nreally are, and this is, Candrak\u012brti explains, what it means to\nbe ultimate reality ([MBh] 6.23 Dbu ma \u2018a 253ab).\n\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s definition raises a couple of important points\nhere. First, by defining ultimate reality as \u201cthe nature of\nthings found by particular exalted cognitive processes (yeshes) of\nthose who perceive reality,\u201d he means ultimate reality is not\nfound by any exalted cognitive processes, it must be found by\na particular exalted cognitive processes\u2014analytic\u2014that\nknows things just as they are. Second, by stating that \u201cit does\nnot exist by virtue of its intrinsic objective reality\u201d\n(svar\u016bpat\u0101 / bdag gi ngo bo nyid), he means ultimate reality\nis not intrinsically real just as much as conventional reality is not\nintrinsically real. Third, he says that ultimate reality is the first\nnature of the two natures of things found by perception of reality.\nThis means ultimate reality is ultimate nature of all conventionally\nreal things. For they all have an ultimate nature representing\nultimate status, just as they have conventional nature representing\nconventional status.\n\nUltimate truth, according to Candrak\u012brti, for the purpose of\nliberating all sentient beings ([M] 6.179 Dbu ma \u2018a\n213a). \u2018a 213a) is differentiated by the Buddha into two\naspects:\n\nnonself of person (pudgalanair\u0101tmya) and\nnonself of phenomena (dharmanair\u0101tmya)\n\n\nAs we shall see Candrak\u012brti\u2019s arguments come from two domains of\nanalysis which he employs to account for his theory of ultimate truth:\nanalysis of personal self (pudgala-\u0101tmya / gang zag gi bdag) and\nanalysis of phenomenal self (dharma-\u0101tmya / chos kyi bdag). The\nanalysis will demonstrate whether or not conventionally real phenomena\nand persons are more than what they are conventionally. So we shall\nconsider Candrak\u012brti\u2019s arguments under this rubrics:\n\nThe not-self argumnent: unreality of conventionally real\nperson;\nThe emptiness argument: unreality of conventionally real\nphenomena;\nThe emptiness is emptiness argument: unreality of ultimate\nreality.\n\n\nLet us begin with the first. The not-self argumnent demonstrates, as\nwe shall see, unreality of conventionally real person. We shall\ndevelop this argument of Candrak\u012brti progressively in three\nsteps:\n\ncorrelation between personal self and the five aggregates;\narguments against personal self; and\nreasons for positing personal self as merely dependently\ndesignated.\n\n\nIn order to appreciate Candrak\u012brti\u2019s not-self argument, or the\nargument that shows unreality of conventionally real person, we need\nto understand Candrak\u012brti\u2019s purpose of refuting personal self.\nAccording to Candrak\u012brti it is important that we look into the\nquestion: from where does the assumption of self arise before we go\nany further. He argues, like all the Buddhist philosophers do, the\nnotion of self or the assumption of self arises in relation to\npersonhood. After all it is a personal identity issue. To analyse the\nself therefore requires us to look closely among the parts that\nconstitute a person, and given that the conception of self is embedded\nin personhood which is constituted by the five aggregates, we need to\nexamine its relation to our conception of self.\n\nSuffice it here to highlight the important relation that exists\nbetween the aggregates and the notion of self. According to\nCandrak\u012brti, the five aggregates are primary categories upon\nwhich we will draw to examine the phenomenal structure of sentient\nbeings, because of the following reasons: because (1) it serves as a\nphenomenological scheme for examining the nature of human experience,\n(2) the way in which human beings construct conceptions of the self is\nbased upon different existential experiences within the framework of\nthe five aggregates, (3) they are the basis upon which we develop the\nsense of self through the view that objectifies the five aggregates\nwhich are transient and composites\n(satk\u0101ya\u1e0d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di / \u2018jig tshogs la lta\nba), either through an appropriation or falsely identifying the\naggregates to be self ([MBh] 6.120, Dbu ma \u2018a 292ab),\n(4) they are the objective domain of the arising of defilements that\ncause us suffering since the false view objectifying the aggregates\n(satk\u0101ya\u1e0d\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e6di / \u2018jig tshogs la lta\nba) to be real self lead to the arising of all \u201cafflictive\ndefilements\u201d, and finally (5) the five aggregates are the\nobjective domain of the knowledge of unreality of personal self. For\nthe simple reason that confusion and misconceptions of self arise in\nrelation to the aggregates, thus it is within the same framework that\nthe realisation of nonself must emerge.\n\nTherefore, for Candrak\u012brti, it is clear that within the range of\nthe five aggregates exhaust \u201call\u201d or\n\u201ceverything\u201d that could be considered as the basis for\ndeveloping the misconception of a reified self and also the\nbasis for correct knowledge of non-self\u2014i.e., reality of person\nor self.\n\nCandrak\u012brti develops his arguments against personal self in a\ngreat detail in [M]/[Mbh] chapter six. Suffice it here to consider one\nsuch argument called \u201cthe argument from the sevenfold analysis\nof a chariot\u201d (shing rta rnams bdun gyi rigs pa). This argument\nhowever is more or less a way of putting all his arguments together.\nIn it, Candrak\u012brti concludes: \u201cthe basis of the conception\nof self, when analysed, is not plausible to be an entity. It is not\nplausible to be different from the aggregates, nor identity of the\naggregates, nor dependent (skandhadh\u0101ra) on the aggregates. The\n\u2018basis\u2019 (skandhadh\u0101ra) at issue is a compound that\nexposes the implausibility of self as both the container\n(\u0101dh\u0101ra / rten) and the contained (adheya / brten pa). The\nself does not own the aggregates. This is established in codependence\non the aggregates\u201d ([M] 6.150, Dbu ma \u2018a 221b).\nPutting this argument analogically, Candrak\u012brti asserts that the\nself is, in terms of not being intrinsically real, analogous to a\nchariot. \u201cWe do not accept a chariot to be different from its\nown parts, nor to be identical [to its parts], nor to be in possession\nof them, nor is it in the parts, nor are the parts in it, nor\nis it the mere composite [of its parts], nor is it the shape [or size\nof the those parts]\u201d ([M] 6.151 Dbu ma \u2018a\n221b).\n\nSo the structure of the nonself \u201cchariot\u201d argument that\ndemonstrates unreality of a conventionally real person can be briefly\nstated as follows:\n\nP1\u00a0 Self is not distinct from the aggregates.\n P2\u00a0 Self is not identical to the aggregates.\n P3\u00a0 Self and the aggregates are not codependent upon each\nother.\n P4\u00a0 Self and the aggregates do not own each other.\n P5\u00a0 Self is not the shape of the aggregates.\n P6\u00a0 Self is not the collection of the aggregates.\n P7\u00a0 There is nothing more to a person than the five\naggregates.\n C\u00a0 Therefore a real personal self does not exist.\n\n\nThere is no ultimately real self that can be logically proven to\nexist. If it did exist it has to be found when it is subjected to\nthese sevenfold analyses. But the self is not found either to be\ndifferent from the aggregates, nor identical to the aggregates, nor to\nbe in possession of them, nor is the self in the aggregates,\nnor are the aggregates in the self, nor is the self the mere\ncomposite of the aggregates; nor is the self the shape or sizes of the\naggregates. Since there is no more to a person any more than\ndependently designated self upon basis of the five aggregates, they\nexhaust all that there is in a person, Candrak\u012brti therefore\nconcludes that there is no real self anywhere whatsoever to be found\nin the five aggregates.\n\nFrom this argument, Candrak\u012brti concludes that both ultimately\nand conventionally, any intrinsic reality of a personal self must\nremain unproven. Therefore according to any of the sevenfold analysis\na personal self is unreal, and empty of any intrinsic reality. What\nCandrak\u012brti does not conclude from this argument, though, is the\nimplausibility of a conventionally real self for everyday purpose. As\nmatter of fact, Candrak\u012brti argues, the argument from the\nsevenfold analysis reinforces the idea that only conventionally real\nself makes sense. For such a self constitutes being dependently\ndesignated on the aggregates in as much as a chariot is dependently\ndesignated on its parts (M / MBh 6.158). Just as the chariot\nis conveniently designated in dependence on its parts, and it is\nreferred to in the world as \u201cagent,\u201d even so, a\nconventionally self which is established through dependent designation\nserves as a conventionally real moral agent. Therefore, although the\nargument from the sevenfold analyses denies the existence of\nintrinsically real self or ultimately real self, the argument does not\nentail a denial of conventionally real self. (M / MBh\n6.159).\n\nIt turns out therefore that a self is merely a convenient designation,\nor a meaningful label given to the five aggregates, and taken for\ngranted in the everyday purpose as a agent. And it is this nominal\nself that serves the purpose of moral agent. This nominal or\nconventional self is comparable to anything that exists\nconventionally. Candrak\u012brti compares it to a chariot.\n\nSecond, Candrak\u012brti\u2019s argument from emptiness demonstrates the\nunreality of the conventionally real phenomena by means of appealing\nto causal processes at work in producing these entities. The\nunderstanding here is that the way in which things arise and come into\nexistence definitively informs us about how things actually are. This\nargument is an extension of N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s famous tetralemma\nargument which states: \u201cneither from itself nor from another nor\nfrom both, nor without cause does anything anywhere, ever\narise.\u201d ([MMK] 1.1) Candrak\u012brti develops this argument in\ngreat detail in chapter 6 of [M]/[MBh], we shall only have a quick look\nat its overall strategy without delving into its details.\n\nIf entities are intrinsically real there are only two alternative ways\nfor them to arise: either they arise (a) causally or (b) causelessly.\nIf one holds that intrinsically real things arise causally, then there\nare only three possible ways for them to arise: either they should\narise from (1) themselves, or from (2) another or from (3) both.\n\n\nP1 If intrinsic entity arise from itself it would absurdly follow that\ncause and effect would be identical and they would exist\nsimultaneously. In which case, the production of an effect would be\npointless for it would be already in existence. It is thus\nunreasonable to assume that something already arisen might arise all\nover again. ([M] 6.8) If an entity in existence still requires arising\nthen an infinite regress would follow ([M] 6. 9\u201313).\n\nP2 If an intrinsically real entity arises from another, anything could\narise from anything (like a fire from pitch-darkness), given that\ncause and effect would be distinct, all causes would be equally\n\u2018another\u2019 ([M] 6. 14\u201321).\n\nP3 If an intrinsic entity arises from both itself and another then\nboth reductio ad absurdums in P1 and P2 would apply ([M] 6.\n98).\n\nP4 If an intrinsic entity arises causelessly, then anything could\narise from everything ([M] 6. 99\u2013103).\n\nThus it is not possible for any intrinsic entity to exist because no\nsuch entity could be causally produce either from itself or from\nanother or both or causelessly. It follows therefore that any entity\nthat arises causally is not intrinsically real, hence it is\ndependently originated entity ([M] 6. 104).\n\n\nCandrak\u012brti therefore insists that entities that are\nintrinsically unreal are not nonexistent unlike intrinsically real\nentities which are nonexistent analogous to the rabbit\u2019s horn. Even\nthough they are not intrinsically real, hence remain unproduced\naccording to the four analyses, unlike the rabbit\u2019s horn,\nintrinsically unreal entities are objects of mundane cognitive\nprocesses, and they arise codependently ([M] 110\u2013114). Hence, in\nsummarising the argument, Candrak\u012brti states: \u201cEntities do\nnot arise causelessly, and they do not arise through causes like God,\nfor example. Nor do they arise out of themselves, nor from another,\nnor from both. They arise codependently.\u201d ([M] 6.114, Dbu ma\n\u2018a 209b) So because entities arise codependently, according to\nCandrak\u012brti, reified concepts such as intrinsic entities cannot\nstand up under logical analysis. The argument from dependent arising\ntherefore eliminates the web of erroneous views presupposing intrinsic\nreality. If entities are intrinsically real, then their arising could\nbe through themselves, from another or from both, causelessly. However\nupon critical analysis the entity as such proves to be nonexistent\n([M]/[MBh] 6. 115\u2013116).\n\nThird, Candrak\u012brti\u2019s argument from the emptiness of emptiness\ndemonstrates the unreality of ultimate reality. The\n\u201cemptiness-argument\u201d and the\n\u201cnonself-argument\u201d show that all conventionally real\nphenomena and persons are empty of intrinsic reality. As we have seen\nfrom a critical rational point of view, it is demonstrated that there\nis no ultimately real or ultimately existent entities or real self of\nperson to be found. The two arguments do not however show that\nemptiness per se is empty, nor do they show that the\nselflessness is itself selfless. This raises an important question:\ndoes this mean that emptiness is the intrinsic reality of\nconventionally real entities and selflessness is the intrinsic reality\nof conventionally real persons? Putting the question differently:\ncould a M\u0101dhyamika claim that emptiness and selflessness are\nultimately real or are intrinsically real? This question is\nreasonable. We tend to posit ultimate reality to be something that is\ntimeless, independent, transcendent, nondual etc. So if emptiness is\nthe ultimate reality of all phenomena and if selflessness is the\nultimate reality of all persons,could we say that emptiness and\nselflessness are nonempty, ultimately real or\nintrinsically real?\n\nIn order to answer this question Candrak\u012brti maintains that the\nBuddha reclassifies emptiness and nonself under various\naspects\u2014\u201cHe elaborated sixteen emptinesses and\nsubsequently he condensed these into four explanations which are\nadopted by the Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\u201d ([M] 6.180 Dbu ma\n\u2018a 213a) We shall consider one example here: Candrak\u012brti\nargues \u201cThe eye is empty of eye[ness] because that is its\nreality. The ear, nose, tongue, body and mind are also to be explained\nin this way.\u201d ([M] 6.181 Dbu ma \u2018a 213ab)\n\u201cBecause each of them are non-eternal (ther zugs tu\ngnas pa ma yin) not subject to disintegration\n(\u2018jig pa ma yin pa) and their reality is\nnon-intrinsic [the emptiness of] the eye and the other six\nfaculties is accepted as \u2018internal emptiness\u2019\n(adhy\u0101tma\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101)\u201d([M] 6.181\nDbu ma \u2018a 2213b).\n\nOn Candrak\u012brit\u2019s view just as the chariot, self and other\nconventionally real phenomena are intrinsically unreal, so too is the\nemptiness and the nonself. Emptiness is also empty of intrinsic\nreality. Candrak\u012brti explains the emptiness of emptiness as:\n\nThe emptiness of intrinsic reality of things is itself called by the\nwise as \u2018emptiness,\u2019 and this emptiness also is considered\nto be empty of any intrinsic reality. ([M] 6.185 Dbu\nma \u2018a 213b) \nThe emptiness of that which is called\n\u2018emptiness\u2019 is accepted as \u2018the emptiness of\nemptiness\u2019 (\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101\u015b\u016bnyat\u0101). It is\nexplained in this way for the purpose of controverting objectification\nof the emptiness as intrinsically real (bh\u0101va). ([M] 6.186\nDbu ma \u2018a 213b)\n\n\nAlso consider Candrak\u012brti\u2019s argument against positing emptiness\nas ultimately real that he develops in his commentary on [MMK] 13.7.\nIf emptiness is ultimately real, emptiness would not be empty of the\nintrinsic reality\u2014the essence of conventionally real objects. In\nthat case we will have to grant emptiness as existing independently of\nconventionally real entities, as their underlying substratum. If this\nis granted the emptiness of a chariot and the empty entity, the\nchariot itself, would be quite distinct and unrelated. Moreover if the\nemptiness of the chariot is nonempty, i.e., if it is ultimately real,\nwhereas the chariot itself is empty i.e., ultimately unreal, then, one\nhas to posit two distinct and contradictory verifiable realities even\nfor one conventionally real chariot. But since there is not even the\nslightest nonempty phenomenon verified in the chariot\u2014not even\nthe slightest bit of entity withstanding critical\nanalysis\u2014emptiness of the chariot, like the chariot itself, is\nimplausible to be ultimately real. Like the chariot itself, the\nemptiness of the chariot is also ultimately empty.\n\nTherefore, while emptiness is the ultimate truth of the conventionally\nreal entities, it is not plausible to posit emptiness to be ultimately\nreal. Similarly, while nonself is the ultimate truth of the personal\nself, nonself is implausible to be ultimately real. Therefore nonself\nis not considered as the essence of persons or self.\n\nSo, to wind up the discussion on the Pr\u0101sa\u1e45gika\u2019s theory of\nthe two truths, just as conventional truth is empty of intrinsic\nreality, hence ultimately unreal, even so, is ultimate truth empty of\nintrinsic reality, hence ultimately unreal. It is, therefore,\ndemonstrated that nothing is ultimately real for Candrak\u012brti,\nhence everything is empty of intrinsic reality. The heart of\nCandrak\u012brti\u2019s two truths theory is the argument that only because\nthey are empty of intrinsic reality can conventionally real entities\nbe causally efficient. Only in the context of a categorical rejection\nof any foundationalism of intrinsic reality\u2014both conventionally\nand ultimate, Candrak\u012brti insists, can there be mundane practices\nrooted in the mutually interdependent character of cognitive\nprocesses and objects cognised. For this reason\nCandrak\u012brti concludes that whomsoever emptiness makes sense,\neverything makes sense. For whomsoever emptiness makes no sense,\ndependent arising would not make sense. Hence nothing would make sense\n([PP] 24.14, Dbu ma \u2018a 166b).\n",
