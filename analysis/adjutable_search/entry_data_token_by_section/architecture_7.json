    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Ontology\n3.1 Ontology\nGiven the familiarity of architecture in, and as constitutive of,\nour physical surroundings, it is strongly intuitive to think of\narchitectural objects simply as buildings, in the way we think of the\nobjects of the sculpture artform as sculptures, or the objects of\ncutlery as forks, knives, and spoons. Yet such intuitions may be\nmisguided. For one, though some built structures\u2014including\nroadways, bazaars, and newspaper kiosks\u2014are not buildings\nper se, we may take them to have architectural properties and\nthereby consider them as architectural objects. For another, the\noutputs of architecture are not limited to built structures but\ninclude as well models, sketches, and plans, and this variety prompts\nquestions as to whether these are all reasonably considered\narchitectural objects and which, if any, such form of output\nrepresents a primary sort of object in architecture. A third\nconsideration is the focus in architecture, not solely on whole or\nindividual buildings, but also on parts of buildings and buildings\nconsidered in context, among other buildings and in landscapes\n(downwards and upwards compositionality or modularity). A fourth\nconsideration is that\u2014as with music and photography\u2014where\nmultiple instantiations of a given work are possible, we may dispute\nwhether the work is identical to the instancing built objects or else\nto the common entity (e.g., plan) on which those instances are\nmodeled. In addition to such challenges, the intuitive view must best\nalternative views.\nInstantiating architectural objects. To address\none sort of question about the identity of an architectural object, we\nseek kind-wise criteria that establish when an object is\narchitectural, instead of being non-architectural altogether\nor only derivatively so. To address another sort of identity question,\nwe look for instance-wise criteria that establish when an\nobject is this or that singular object, or an instance of a multiple\nobject. Ready criteria for identifying object instances in\narchitecture include historical, environmental, stylistic, and formal\nfeatures\u2014all of which may be read as signaling intentions to\ndesign particular, self-contained architectural objects. One issue,\nhowever, is whether traditional criteria (or others as may be posed)\nare sufficiently specific so as to skirt vagueness problems that all\nsuch artifacts may face (Thomasson 2005) and provide markers of being\na bona fide instance of a multiple work or a replica of all\nother bona fide instances (Goodman 1968/1976). \nArchitectural objects as ontologically\ndistinctive. Yet another way to pick out architectural\nobjects is to set them apart from other art objects or artifacts.\nAssuming there is more than one art ontology (see\nLivingston 2013), we might look to define a distinctive architectural\nontology by reference to specifically architectural qualities, such as\n\u201cmass\u201d (degrees of heaviness and lightness) or\ndirectedness (in circulatory pathways); or utility considerations,\nsuch as functional design, use, and change; or everyday artifactual\nfeatures. An inclusivist may add features special to the built\nenvironment beyond the realm of buildings.\nKinds of architectural ontologies.\nArchitecture\u2019s distinctive qualities may help sort among\ncandidate ontologies. One option is concretism, which\u2014in keeping\nwith standard causal efficacy claims and expressed intentions of\narchitects, clients, and users\u2014suggests that architectural\nobjects are either built structures or, on one variant, otherwise\nphysically instantiated designs for such structures (such as\nmodels). Concretism is supported by an artifactual ontology that\nsubsumes architectural objects into the class of objects that are the\nproduct of intentions, designs, and choices (on the view that\nall art objects are best so understood, see Dutton 1979,\nS. Davies 1991, Thomasson 1999, and Levinson 2007.) One version of\narchitectural artifactualism identifies buildings as systems (Handler\n1970). As against concretism, intentionality may be the mark of\nmaterially constituted, designed architectural objects but that need\nnot commit us to their existence alone or their primacy among such\nobjects. Moreover, taking intentions as determinative leaves the\nconcretist with the problem of shifting intentions and unintended\ngoals attached to built structures over time.\nAbstractist alternatives follow a well-worn path in aesthetics\n(Kivy 1983; Dodd 2007; critics include S. Davies 1991; Trivedi 2002;\nKania 2008; D. Davies 2009) and accommodate an expansive architectural\ndomain that includes historical, fantasy, and unbuilt works. Per\nclassic Platonism, abstractism allows identification of an\narchitectural object and concrete counterparts\u2014including\nmultiple replicas\u2014by reference to a single, fixed, and\nunchanging background source of what real world structures (or fantasy\nstructures) are and should look like.\nAgainst abstractism, some architectural objects are apparently\nsingular because historically and geographically contingent (Ingarden\n1962); it is unclear what an experiential account of\narchitectural abstracta looks like; and abstracta are not created\nwhereas architectural objects are. De Clercq (2012) further proposes\nthat, even if there were abstract architectural objects, we\ndon\u2019t refer to them. If I refer to \u201c10 Downing\nStreet\u201d, my expression picks out the built structure, not the\nplan, nor any other abstract representation or entity to which the\nbuilt structure at 10 Downing Street corresponds. However, a plausible\nalternate interpretation of the referent is as \u201cthe abstract\nobject physically instantiated by the structure I am perceiving (or\nhave perceived)\u201d.\nAs an alternative to an abstractist-concretist divide, a pluralist\nontology (per Danto 1993), allows \u201cmaterial\nbases\u201d and \u201caesthetic ideas\u201d as different sorts of\narchitectural objects. Goodman\u2019s account (1968/1976) lends\nitself to a pluralist, or at least aspectual, reading. He suggests\nthat, but for certain conditions unmet, an architectural object could\nbe identified as those structures that perfectly realize a\ncorresponding plan or other suitable architectural notation (see \u00a74). On his nominalist view, the\nobjects turn out to be the built structures but an available realist\ninterpretation\u2014which may better accommodate the multiples that\nare key to his story\u2014takes the objects to be the class of such\nstructures. \nAnother alternative suggests that architecture consists in actions\nor performances (per Currie 1989; D. Davies 2004), rendering\nderivative any concrete structures or \u201ctraditional\u201d\nabstract entities. Lopes (2007) proposes the possibility of an events\nor temporal parts ontology for a kind of built structure that passes\nin and out of existence, though De Clercq (2008, 2012) counters that\nsuch can be rendered in a material objects ontology through temporal\nindexing. Yet other ontologies are contextual or social\nconstructivist, proposing that architectural objects exist, beyond\ntheir status as structured materials, in virtue of ways our reality is\nframed, psychologically, socially, or culturally (per\nHartmann 1953, Margolis 1958). A shift in any such frame may bring\nabout shifting identity in an architectural object, in the manner of\nBorgesian art indiscernibles (Danto 1964), and it may count in favor of\nthose ontologies that architectural indiscernibles are all around, in\nthe form of repurposed built structures.\nPicking an ontology has wide-ranging significance, relative to\nquestions of material constitution, composition, part-whole relations,\nproperties, and relations in architecture, as well as the character of\narchitectural notation, language, cognition, or behavior; there are\nalso ramifications for simplicity and complexity, and the nature of\nornament, proportion, context, and style. In architectural practice,\nthe ontology of choice also colors perspectives on such matters as\nintellectual property rights, collaborative work, and preservation of\narchitectural structures. \n",
