    "main_text": "History || September Group\n2.2 September Group\n\nDespite those caveats, the September Group did provide an\ninstitutional focus and momentum that was crucial to the early\nevolution of analytical Marxism.\n\nThe \u201cprehistory\u201d of the September Group centred on two\nLondon meetings of Marxist and Marxistant scholars working on\nexploitation\u2014convened at the initiative of Elster, and with the\nsupport of Cohen\u2014in September 1979 and 1980. It was then decided\nto meet annually but no longer limit the discussion to exploitation.\nConsequently, the third meeting might be identified as the point at\nwhich the September Group had properly formed. It was attended by\n\u201cthe most dedicated\u201d of those who had attended the first\ntwo meetings, plus \u201cone or two\u201d new invitees (G. Cohen\n2000b: xix).\n\nBetween 1981 and 2002, membership of the Group was \u201cremarkably\nstable\u201d (G. Cohen 2000b: xix). These annual early\nmeetings\u2014usually, but not always, held in London\u2014are\nremembered as intense and rewarding occasions, at which half of the\ngroup would pre-circulate papers, which were then introduced and\ncommented on by someone other than the author (Wright 2005a,\n343\u2013344).\n\nIn 2000 the Group included (with then current academic affiliations in\nparenthesis): the economist Pranab Bardhan (Berkeley); the economist\nSamuel Bowles (Amherst); the historian Robert Brenner (Los Angeles);\nthe political philosopher G.A. Cohen (Oxford); the political\nphilosopher Joshua Cohen (Cambridge, Mass.); the political philosopher\nPhilippe van Parijs (Louvain-la Neuve); the economist John Roemer\n(Yale); the political philosopher Hillel Steiner (Manchester); the\npolitical philosopher Robert Jan van der Veen (Amsterdam); the social\nscientist Erik Wright (Madison). Only two of that list had not been\nparticipants in 1982: Bowles had joined in 1987 and Joshua Cohen in\n1996 (G. Cohen 2000b: xix).\n\nThe academic location of analytical Marxism is often noted, and\nsometimes linked with its purported distance from practical, real\nworld, concerns. One critic refers to \u201cthe donnish remoteness of\nthe whole project\u201d (Roberts 1996: 219), and another maintains\nthat its \u201cstandards of judgement\u201d and \u201csense of\nproportion\u201d are \u201cderived not from the political arena but\nfrom the Senior Common Room\u201d (E. Wood 1989: 88). The gender\ncomposition of the September Group is also sometimes raised as a\nconcern, and its early practices would certainly appear to have\nreproduced, rather than challenged, the contemporary marginalisation\nof women in the relevant academic disciplines (Wright 2005a: 344).\n\nThere is also critical interest in the ideological composition of the\nGroup. Descriptions of the Group as involving \u201ca set of\nMarxists, or semi-Marxists\u201d (G. Cohen 2013: 95), and as composed\nof scholars of \u201cMarxist or quasi-Marxist stripe\u201d (G. Cohen\n2000b: xix), might be thought not to capture, either its early\ndiversity, or the direction of its subsequent evolution. Wright\ncharacterises the politics of participants as ranging: \n\n\nfrom fairly traditional commitments to revolutionary democratic\nsocialism to the Greens to what might be termed left-wing\nlibertarianism. (1994: 181) \n\n\nAmongst proponents of the latter, Steiner characterises his own views\nas \u201c[b]asically left-wing, though in a sense which has been\nlargely unfashionable for most of this century\u201d (Ricciardi 1997:\n38), whilst Van Parijs describes himself as a person emphatically of\nthe left, but as someone who has \u201cnever defined myself as a\nMarxist\u201d, adding that he had always felt \u201cextremely\ncomfortable\u201d within the September Group precisely \u201cbecause\nit included fellow travellers and not just analytical Marxists\u201d\n(1997: 17). At one point, the possibility of\n\u201cpolitical-ideological criteria for \u201cmembership\u201d in\nthe annual meeting\u201d was discussed, but the Group agreed that\nwhat really mattered was not a commitment to a particular set of\npolitical positions, but rather \u201cthe possibility of constructive\ndialogue among the participants\u201d (Wright 1994: 181 fn4).\n\nThe biggest internal disruption in the Group\u2019s early history\nconsisted in the dramatic departure, in 1993, of Elster (the original\nconvener) and the political scientist Adam Przeworski (who had joined\nin the second year). Its causes remain uncertain. The\n\u201cleavers\u201d expressed criticisms of the evolving\nintellectual character of the group, and Przeworski suggested that\ninsofar as its original purpose was the critical evaluation of\nMarxism, that task had been completed, and that \u201c[w]e ultimately\nfound that not much of Marxism is left and there really wasn\u2019t\nmuch more to learn\u201d (2007: 490). Indeed, Elster would\nsubsequently characterise analytical Marxism as a rare case of\n\u201cintellectual autophagy\u201d, which had succeeded in revealing\nthat \u201cnon-bullshit Marxism\u201d was largely \u201can empty\nset\u201d (2011: 163). Marx\u2019s only remaining contribution of\nvalue was now said to concern, not his substantive views, but\n\u201chis normative conception of the good life as one of active and\njoint self-realization\u201d (2011: 163). In contrast, some\n\u201cremainers\u201d viewed these departures as reflecting external\nfactors, especially the complex impact of the demise of the Soviet\nUnion on a certain generation of leftists. \u201cComplex\u201d, not\nleast, in that its demise was seen as involving both the removal of a\nhideous regime and the loss of a non-capitalist space (G. Cohen 2009b:\n352).\n\nThose contemporary tendencies\u2014the perceived waning of both the\nvalue of Marxist ideas, and the availability of non-capitalist\nalternatives\u2014perhaps impacted more widely on the dynamism and\nfocus of the Group. In 2000 participants debated whether to continue.\nSome thought the decision to carry on (meeting biannually) was\nmotivated as much by fellowship as strictly intellectual pay-offs\n(Wright 2005a: 345). Others affirmed the continuing intellectual\nbenefits of a group of \u201cpeople from different academic\ndisciplines who have a radical orientation and who can fertilize each\nother\u2019s thoughts\u201d (G. Cohen 2009b: 352).\n\nThe September Group is now widely seen to have evolved away from a\nprimarily Marxist orientation and towards other concerns. Wright\nsuggested that whilst the group still shared an egalitarian approach\nto social justice: \n\n\nthe specific preoccupation with Marxism as a source of ideas and\ndebates for advancing that normative agenda was no longer so\nimportant. (2005a: 345) \n\n\nThat tendential evolution was reflected in, and perhaps amplified by,\nthe arrival of new participants (with then current academic\naffiliations in parenthesis), including the political scientist\nStathis Kalyvas (Yale) and the philosopher Seana Shiffrin (UCLA). Even\nthose who identified as Marxists were less likely to think of Marxism\nas \u201ca comprehensive theoretical paradigm capable of constituting\na general theory of history and society\u201d (Wright 2005a:\n342). The simple passage of time also left its mark on the composition\nand character of the Group (G. A. Cohen died in 2009, and Wright in\n2019). This evolution remains tendential, in that there may be\nexceptions, perhaps including Brenner\u2019s work on the transition\nfrom feudalism to capitalism, and on the nature of contemporary\ncapitalism (1993, and 2002). However, Roemer has recently confirmed\nthat, although the Group continues to meet, \u201cmost of us no\nlonger identify as Marxists\u201d (Roemer 2019b in\n Other Internet Resources).\n That \u201cmost\u201d appears to include Roemer himself: \n\n\nI tend not to call myself a Marxist anymore because I do not credit\nmany of the ideas that Marx believed were at the center of his view:\nthe labour theory of value, the falling rate of profit, and the claim\nthat dialectical materialism is a special kind of logic. (Roemer\n2020b: 135) \n\n\nOf course, it is not certain that Roemer had previously subscribed to\nthose particular Marxist ideas either (see 1981), but the changing self-identification says something\nnonetheless.\n\nWhilst the September Group provided an institutional focus and\nmomentum that was crucial to the early evolution of analytical\nMarxism, neither the past, nor the future, of these two entities is\nidentical.\n",
