Paradoxes and puzzles involving infinity || Paralysis\n5.3 Paralysis\n\nSuppose that Achilles wants to run from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) but there are\ninfinitely many gods who\u2014unbeknownst to one another and to\nAchilles\u2014each have reason to stop him from getting to \\(B\\). God\n1 resolves to instantaneously paralyse Achilles if and when he reaches\nhalfway between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). God 2 resolves to instantaneously\nparalyse Achilles if and when he reaches one quarter of the way from\n\\(A\\) to \\(B\\). \u2026 God \\(n\\) resolves to instantaneously\nparalyse Achilles if and when he reaches \\(1/2^n\\) of the way from\n\\(A\\) to \\(B\\). \u2026 Since all of the Gods are able to act on\ntheir resolve, Achilles is unable to move: for, if he moved, he would\nviolate the intentions of infinitely many Gods. But, until he does\nmove, none of the Gods act on their intentions. So what actually stops\nhim from moving? Isn\u2019t it absurd to suppose that someone can be\nrendered immobile by a nested sequence of conditional intentions upon\nwhich no one acts?\n\nSuppose instead that each of the Gods erects a force field, placed in\na parallel manner to the previous case, that it is impossible for\nAchilles to cross. Then Achilles is completely immobilized. On the\nassumption that it is possible for an infinite number of Gods to\ncollectively create such a force field in the manner described, there\nis a straightforward explanation for Achilles\u2019 inability to\nmove. Of course, granted this assumption, there is no single God whose\nforce field immobilizes Achilles; indeed, there is no finite\ncollection of Gods whose collective force field does so; indeed, no\nforce field touches him at all. Is this possible? Presumably one\nshould come to the same verdict regarding the conditional intentions\ncase as in this case.\n\nDepending on your views about the range of possibility, there is much\nin this story that you may think is impossible. You may think that it\nis impossible for there to be Gods who can act as required; for\nexample, depending on your conception of the Gods and their actions,\nyou might think that the story requires instantaneous action at a\ndistance. You may think that it is impossible for force fields to be\npositioned with unbounded degrees of accuracy. And so on. However, if\nthere is nothing in the set-up that makes you baulk, and if further\nelaboration of the set-up does not introduce any singularities, then\nit seems that you should just accept the conclusions with equanimity:\nAchilles is rendered immobile by conditional intentions on which no\none acts, or by a set of force fields none of which he is in direct\ncontact with. Bizarrely counterfactual circumstances have bizarre\nconsequences.\n\nFor further discussion of this case, see: Benardete (1964, which\nintroduces it), Moore (1990/2019), Priest (1999), Hawthorne (2000),\nPerez-Laraudogoitia (2000, 2003), Yablo (2000), Oppy (2006), Koons\n(2014), and Huemer (2016), Caie (2018).\n\nWe have started to see that infinity seems to be both friend and\nfoe\u2014it features in powerful mathematics, but also in some vexing\nconundrums. We will see more of its Manichean nature in the following\nsections on probability, decision theory, and space and time. We will\nalso see how sophisticated methods for reclaiming it have been\ndeveloped.\n",
