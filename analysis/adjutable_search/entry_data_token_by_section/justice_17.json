    "main_text": "Utilitarianism and Justice || Utilitarian theories of justice: three problems\n4.2 Utilitarian theories of justice: three problems\n\nYet despite these efforts to reconcile justice and utility, three\nserious obstacles still remain. The first concerns what we might call\nthe currency of justice: justice has to do with the way that tangible\nbenefits and burdens are assigned, and not with the happiness or\nunhappiness that the assignees experience. It is a matter of justice,\nfor example, that people should be paid the right amount for the jobs\nthat they do, but, special circumstances aside, it is no concern of\njustice that John derives more satisfaction from his fairly-earned\nincome than Jane does from hers (but see Cohen 1989 for a different\nview). There is so to speak, a division of labour, under which rights,\nopportunities, and material benefits of various kinds are allocated by\nprinciples of justice, while the conversion of these into units of\nutility (or disutility) is the responsibility of each individual\nrecipient (see Dworkin 2000, ch. 1). Utilitarians will therefore find\nit hard to explain what from their point of view seems to be the\nfetishistic concern of justice over how the means to happiness are\ndistributed, rather than happiness itself.\n\nThe second obstacle is that utilitarianism judges outcomes by\ntotalling up utility levels, and has no independent concern for how\nthat utility is distributed between persons. So even if we set aside\nthe currency issue, utilitarian theory seems unable to capture\njustice\u2019s demand that each should receive what is due\nto her regardless of the total amount of benefit this generates.\nDefenders of utilitarianism will argue that when the conduct-guiding\nrules are being formulated, attention will be paid to distributive\nquestions. In particular, when resources are being distributed among\npeople we know little about individually, there are good reasons to\nfavour equality, since in most cases resources have diminishing\nmarginal utility \u2013 the more of them you have, the less\nsatisfaction you derive from additional instalments. Yet this is only\na contingent matter. If some people are very adept at turning\nresources into well-being \u2013 they are so-called \u2018utility\nmonsters\u2019 \u2013 then a utilitarian should support a rule that\nprivileges them. This seems repugnant to justice. As Rawls famously\nput the general point, \u2018each member of society is thought to\nhave an inviolability founded on justice which\u2026.even the\nwelfare of every one else cannot override\u2019 (Rawls 1971, p. 28;\nRawls 1999, pp. 24\u201325).\n\nThe third and final difficulty stems from utilitarianism\u2019s\nthoroughgoing consequentialism. Rules are assessed strictly in the\nlight of the consequences of adopting then, not in terms of their\nintrinsic properties. Of course, when agents follow rules, they are\nmeant to do what the rule requires rather than to calculate\nconsequences directly. But for a utilitarian, it is never going to be\na good reason for adopting a rule that it will give people what they\ndeserve or what they are entitled to, when desert or entitlement are\ncreated by events in the past, such as a person\u2019s having\nperformed a worthwhile action or entered an agreement.\nBackward-looking reasons have to be transmuted into forward-looking\nreasons in order to count. If a rule such as pacta sunt\nservanda (\u2018agreements must be kept\u2019) is going to be\nadopted on utilitarian grounds, this is not because there is any\ninherent wrongness in defaulting on a compact one has made, but\nbecause a rule that compacts must be kept is a useful one, since it\nallows people to co-ordinate their behaviour knowing that their\nexpectations about the future are likely to be met. But justice,\nalthough not always backward-looking in the sense explained, often is.\nWhat is due to a person is in many cases what they deserve for what\nthey have done, or what they are entitled to by virtue of past\ntransactions. So even if it were possible to construct a\nforward-looking rationale for having rules that closely tracked desert\nor entitlement as these are normally understood, the utilitarian still\ncannot capture the sense of justice \u2013 why it matters\nthat people should get what is due to then \u2013 that informs our\ncommon-sense judgements.\n\nUtilitarians might reply that their reconstruction preserves what is\nrationally defensible in common sense beliefs while what it discards\nare elements that cannot survive sustained critical reflection. But\nthis would bring them closer to Bentham\u2019s view that justice, as\ncommonly understood, is nothing but a \u2018phantom\u2019.\n",
