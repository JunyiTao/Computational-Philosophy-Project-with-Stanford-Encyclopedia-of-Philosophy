    "main_text": "Objections to Emotivism and Relativism || Russell\u2019s Feelings and the Duck Argument\n8.7 Russell\u2019s Feelings and the Duck Argument\n\nBut in defending himself against the charge of inconsistency, Russell\nmakes a crucial concession.\n\n\nBut what are \u201cgood\u201d desires? Are they anything more than\ndesires that you share? Certainly there seems to be something\nmore \u2026 In opposing the proposal [to introduce bull-fighting\ninto America], I should feel, not only that I was expressing\nmy desires, but that my desires in the matter are right,\nwhatever that may mean.\n\n\nWhat exactly is it that Russell feels? That those who think\nbull-fighting is good (and therefore desire it) are making some kind\nof mistake and conversely that those think that bull-fighting\nis bad (and are therefore opposed to it) are in some sense getting\nit right. Thus the \u201csomething more\u201d that Russell\ncould not help feeling was that his views about the badness of\nbullfighting were true and the views of the imaginary\nbull-fighting aficionados false. But how can that be if\n\u201cbull-fighting is bad,\u201d really is in the optative? For a\nsentence to be true or false it must be semantically capable of truth\nand falsity or, as the current jargon has it, truth-apt. Thus\nin admitting that he could not help feeling that he would be right\n(that is, correct) to oppose bull-fighting in America, Russell, was\nadmitting to feelings which suggest that his meta-ethic is false.\nMoreover the very fact that he had these feelings provides\nevidence for his theory\u2019s falsehood. Consider \u201cOh to be in\nEngland, now that April\u2019s here!\u201d, a sentence that is clearly in\nthe optative (except for the bit about April\u2019s being here). It is hard\nto see how anybody who understood this sentence could coherently feel\nor think it to be true or false. Its optative character is obvious (to\nthose who understand English) and the fact that it is in the optative\nexcludes the possibility of truth and falsehood. Since Russell\nwas inclined to feel that \u201cBull-fighting is bad\u201d\nis true, and since this is not an incoherent thing to feel or think,\nthis strongly suggests that \u201cbull-fighting is bad\u201d, unlike\n\u201cOh to be in England!\u201d, is not in the optative mood.\n\nIndeed there is something odd about the very idea of a disguised\noptative. Of course, it is possible to give orders or express wishes\nby means of sentences that are grammatically in the indicative mood.\nHenry IV\u2019s \u201cYou have good leave to leave us\u201d, is\ngrammatically in the indicative but it is merely a slightly less curt\nvariant of the obviously imperative \u201cWorcester, get thee\ngone\u201d (Shakespeare, Henry IV, 1.3). But when we use\nindicatives to express wishes or convey commands we are engaging in\ncommunicative acts which would misfire badly if the people we were\ntalking to failed to get the point. Even if King Henry had confined\nhimself to \u201cYou have good leave to leave us\u201d, omitting the\nexplicitly imperative \u201cWorcester, get thee gone\u201d,\nWorcester would have had to be singularly obtuse not to realize that\nhe was being ordered to leave. Competent speakers are usually well\naware when a grammatically indicative sentence is being used to give a\ncommand or express a desire (indeed, this is one of the\ncriteria of linguistic competence!). But it is Russell\u2019s\nhypothesis that, despite appearances, \u201cX is good\u201d\n(in the sense of good as an end) is exclusively in the optative mood\neven though, for most people, it is neither intended nor interpreted\nas such. We have been good-ing and bad-ing things up and down for\nhundreds of years whilst radically misunderstanding the meanings of\nour own utterances. To suppose this is to suppose that meaning is\nindependent of our collective intentions, which is a very large dead\nrat to swallow. Russell might reply that our usage belies our stated\nintentions, that we use \u201cX is good\u201d as if\nit were in the optative, and that despite our protestations to the\ncontrary, his theory provides the best explanation of our\nactual use. The problem with this reply is that it is based on an\nobviously false premise. We don\u2019t in fact use \u201cX is\ngood\u201d as if it were in the optative mood\u2014we treat as if it\nwere truth-apt. This brings me to the most obvious and perhaps the\nmost compelling objection to emotivism\u2014what I like to call the\nDuck Argument.\n\nThe main problem for most forms of non-cognitivism is that moral\njudgments look and behave like propositions\u2014that is, in this\nconnection, the kinds of things that can be true or false. They have,\nas the jargon has it, a \u201cpropositional surface\u201d. We claim\nthat such sentences are true or false, we speak of knowing\nthe difference between good and bad, right and wrong (where knowledge\nwould appear to entail truth), we wonder whether our ethical\nopinions are right or wrong (in the sense of correct or incorrect) and\nbelieve that we or others are, or at least may be,\nmistaken in our moral beliefs (in the sense that they may be\nfalse). All this is difficult to make sense of except on the\nassumption that moral judgments are what they appear to\nbe\u2014statements which express beliefs, describe some purported\nfacts and are therefore capable of truth and falsity. The argument\ndoes not show that there are such facts (after all, much the\nsame points could be made about theological discourse, and a set of\ntruth-apt sentences cannot conjure God into existence). It could be\nthat there are no moral facts corresponding to our opinions and thus\nthat they are predominately false, like the propositions of Greek\nmythology. But the way we talk strongly suggests that our moral\npronouncements are in the true/false game, and thus that they are\ntruth-apt or truth-valued. If something looks like a duck, swims like\na duck and quacks like a duck, then the chances are that it is indeed\na duck! Likewise, if something looks like a truth-apt\nexpression (since on the surface it is in the indicative mood), if it\nbehaves logically like a truth-apt expression (which again is\nwhat \u201cX is good\u201d undoubtedly does), if it is\ntreated by the people whose use sustains its meaning as\nif it were truth-apt, then, absent compelling arguments to the\ncontrary, it probably is truth-apt.\n",
