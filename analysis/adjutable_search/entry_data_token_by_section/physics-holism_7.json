The Quantum Physics of Entangled Systems\n\nQuantum entanglement is in the first instance a relation between not\nphysical but mathematical objects representing the states of quantum\nsystems. Different forms of quantum theory represent quantum states of\nvarious systems by different kinds of mathematical object. So the\nconcept of quantum entanglement has been expressed by a family of\ndefinitions, each appropriate to a specific form and application of\nquantum theory (see Earman (2015)). The first definition\n(Schr\u00f6dinger (1935)) was developed in the context of applications\nof ordinary non-relativistic quantum mechanics to pairs of\ndistinguishable particles that have interacted, such as an electron\nand proton.\n\nA hydrogen atom may be represented in ordinary non-relativistic\nquantum mechanics as a quantum system composed of two subsystems: an\nelectron e and a nuclear proton p.\nWhen isolated, its quantum state may be represented\nby a vector \\(\\Psi\\) in a space H constructed as a\ntensor product of spaces \\(H_{p}\\) and \\(H_{e}\\) used to represent\nstates of \\(e, p\\) respectively. The states of \\(e, p\\) are then\ndefined as entangled if and only if\n \n \n\n\\[ \\Psi \\ne \\Psi_{p} \\otimes \\Psi_{e}\\]\n\n\nfor every pair of vectors \\(\\Psi_{p}, \\Psi_{e}\\) in\n\\(H_{p}\\), \\(H_{e}\\) respectively. This definition naturally\ngeneralizes to systems composed of n\ndistinguishable particles. But alternative definitions seem preferable\nfor a collection of indistinguishable particles\u2014of electrons or\nof photons for example (see Ghirardi et al. (2002), Ladyman\net al. (2013)).\n\nIt follows that the states of electron and proton in an isolated\nhydrogen atom are entangled. But one may also represent the hydrogen\natom as composed of a center-of-mass subsystem C\nand a relative subsystem R represented by vector\nstates \\(\\Psi_{C}\\), \\(\\Psi_{R}\\) in \\(H_{C}, H_{R}\\) respectively\nsuch that\n \n \n\n\\[ \\Psi = \\Psi_{C} \\otimes \\Psi_{R}\\]\n\n\nIf the state of the hydrogen atom is represented by \\(\\Psi\\) then the\nstates of quantum subsystems \\(C, R\\) are not entangled but the states\nof quantum subsystems \\(p, e\\) are entangled. This illustrates the\nimportant point that one cannot draw metaphysical conclusions from a\nmathematical condition of quantum entanglement without first deciding\nwhich quantum systems are physical parts composing some physical\nwhole. It may seem natural to take the physical parts of a hydrogen\natom to be an electron and a proton. But note that the state of an\nisolated hydrogen atom is usually represented by \\(\\Psi_{R}\\), and not\nby \\(\\Psi\\) or \\(\\Psi_{e}\\).\n\nViewed as basic physical parts of a hydrogen atom represented by state\n\\(\\Psi\\), its electron and proton may be considered entangled physical\nparts since \\(\\Psi\\) cannot be expressed as a product of vectors\nrepresenting the state of each. The electron and the proton may each\nbe assigned a mixed state, but these do not uniquely determine the\nstate \\(\\Psi\\): state separability is violated. This may occasion no\nsurprise if a system\u2019s state merely specifies its chances of\nexhibiting various possible properties on measurement. But it may have\nmetaphysical significance if a system\u2019s quantum state plays a\nrole in specifying its categorical properties\u2014its real state, so\nthat the\n real state separability principle\n is threatened. His commitment to this principle is one reason why\nEinstein denied that a physical system\u2019s real state is given by\nits quantum state (though it\u2019s not clear what he thought its\nreal state consisted in). But according to (one variant of) the rival\nCopenhagen interpretation, the quantum state gives a physical\nsystem\u2019s real dynamical state by specifying that it contains\njust those qualitative intrinsic quantum dynamical properties to which\nit assigns probability 1. On this last interpretation, violation of\nstate separability in quantum mechanics leads to\n physical property holism:\n it implies, for example, that a pair of fundamental particles may\nhave the intrinsic property of being spinless even though this is not\ndetermined by the intrinsic properties and relations of its component\nparticles.\n\nIf an entangled pure vector state of a pair of quantum systems\nviolates state separability then there are measurements of dynamical\nvariables (one on each subsystem) whose joint quantum probability\ndistribution cannot be expressed as a product of probability\ndistributions for separate measurements of each variable. Quantum\ntheory predicts such a probability distribution for each of many types\nof spatially separated measurements of variables including spin and\npolarization components on a pair of entangled physical entities\nassigned such a state, and many of these distributions have been\nexperimentally verified. If one thought that quantum theory treats\neach dynamical variable by replacing a precise real value assignment\nby a probability distribution for the results of measurements of that\ndynamical variable, one might take this already to violate the real\nstate separability principle. But if one entertains a theory that\nsupplements the quantum state by values of additional\n\u201chidden\u201d variables, then the quantum probabilities would\nbe taken to arise from averaging over many distinct hidden states. In\nthat case, it would rather be the probability distribution conditional\non a complete specification of the values of the hidden variables that\nshould be taken to specify the underlying chances of system and\nsubsystems exhibiting various possible properties on measurement. The\nreal state might then include all these conditional probability\ndistributions. The best known example of such a theory is the Bohm\ntheory (see the entry on\n Bohmian mechanics),\n where the \u201chidden\u201d variables are spatial positions. In\neach specific experimental context all conditional probabilities are 0\nor 1, so the joint conditional probability distributions indeed\nfactorize. But the outcome of a measurement of a chosen dynamical\nvariable on one subsystem depends on what dynamical variable is chosen\nand measured on the other, no matter just when or how far apart these\nmeasurements are selected and made.\n\nBell (1964, [2004]) reasoned that any local hidden variable\ntheory must yield conditional probabilities of 0 or 1 for each local\noutcome in order to reproduce all quantum predictions but could not\npermit these to depend on the choice of distant measurement. He then\nproved that the probabilistic predictions of any local hidden variable\ntheory must satisfy particular inequalities violated by predictions of\nquantum theory for certain entangled state assignments (see entry\n Bell\u2019s Theorem).\n In later work Bell (1990, [2004]) generalized this argument to apply\nto any theory of a certain type meeting a condition he called Local\nCausality which, he claimed, quantum mechanics does not meet. Howard\n(1989, 1992) took outcome independence \u2014 the probabilistic\nindependence of the outcomes of a given pair of measurements, one on\neach of a pair of entangled systems, conditional on definite values\nfor any assumed hidden variables on the joint system\u2014as a\nseparability condition. Outcome independence may be contrasted with\nparameter independence\u2014the condition that, given a definite\nhidden variable assignment, the outcome of a measurement on one of a\npair of entangled systems is probabilistically independent of what\nmeasurement, if any, is made on the other system. Together with\nparameter independence, outcome independence implies the factorization\nof conditional probabilities that leads to what are now called Bell\ninequalities. These inequalities constrain the patterns of statistical\ncorrelations to be expected between the results of measurements of\nvariables such as spin and polarization on a pair of entangled systems\nin any quantum state. Quantum mechanics predicts, and experiment\nconfirms, that such Bell inequalities do not always hold. The Bohm\ntheory accommodates this fact by its violation of parameter\ndependence, and hence Local Causality. But Howard (1989), as well as\nTeller (1989), suggested that we appeal instead to a failure of\noutcome independence to understand why Bell inequalities do not always\nhold, and that this failure is associated rather with holism or\nnonseparability. Howard (1989) blamed the violation of Bell\ninequalities on the violation of his separability condition: Teller\n(1989) took it to be a manifestation of\n relational holism.\n They both acquit parameter independence of blame because they believe\nthat (at least when the measurement events on the entangled systems\nare spacelike separated) parameter independence (unlike outcome\nindependence) is a consequence of relativity theory: (note that the\nBohm theory requires a preferred frame not provided by relativity\ntheory).\n\nHenson (2013) and others have questioned this line of reasoning,\nincluding the conclusion that its appeal to holism or nonseparability\nhelps one to understand how these correlations involving entangled\nsystems come about without any action at a distance that violates\nrelativity theory, Local Causality or Einstein\u2019s (1948)\n\nPrinciple of Local Action:\n If A and B are spatially\ndistant things, then an external influence on A has\nno immediate effect on B.\n\n\nHoward\u2019s (1989,1992) identification of outcome independence with\na separability condition has proved controversial, as has\nTeller\u2019s (1989) claim that violations of Bell inequalities are\nno longer puzzling if one embraces (physical) relational holism\n(Laudisa 1995; Berkowitz 1998; Henson 2013). Winsberg and Fine (2003)\nobject that separability requires only that the conditional joint\nprobabilities be determined as some function of the marginal\nprobabilities, whereas outcome independence arbitrarily restricts this\nto be the product function. By allowing other kinds of functional\ndependence they are able to construct models of experiments whose\nresults would exhibit violations of Bell inequalities. They claim that\nthese models are both local and separable even though they violate\noutcome independence. But Fogel (2007) presents alternative\nformalizations of the separability condition, of which several indeed\nimply outcome independence. The view that violations of outcome\nindependence are consistent with relativity theory, while violations\nof parameter independence are not, has also been criticized (Jones\n& Clifton 1993; Maudlin 2011). But Myrvold (2016) has responded by\narguing that locally-initiated state-vector collapse in violation of\noutcome dependence may be perfectly compatible with relativity.\n\nWhile diverging from the Copenhagen prescription mentioned above, some\n modal interpretations\n take real states of systems to be closely enough related to quantum\nstates that entangled systems\u2019 violation of quantum state\nseparability implies some kind of holism or nonseparability. Van\nFraassen (1991, p. 294), for example, sees his modal interpretation as\ncommitted to \u201ca strange holism\u201d because it entails that a\ncompound system may fail to have a property corresponding to a tensor\nproduct projection operator \\(P\\otimes I\\) even though its first\ncomponent has a property corresponding to P. In\nfact, a clearer case of holism would arise in a modal interpretation\nthat implied that the component lacked P while the\ncompound had \\(P\\otimes I\\): ceteris paribus, that would\nprovide an instance of physical property holism. Healey (1989,1994)\noffered a modal interpretation and used it to present a model account\nof the puzzling correlations which portrays them as resulting from the\noperation of a process that violates both\n spatial\n and\n spatiotemporal separability.\n He argued that, on this interpretation, the\n nonseparability\n of the process is a consequence of\n physical property holism;\n and that the resulting account yields genuine understanding of how\nthe correlations come about without any violation of relativity theory\nor\n Local Action.\n But subsequent work by Clifton and Dickson (1998) and Myrvold (2001)\ncast doubt on whether the account can be squared with relativity\ntheory\u2019s requirement of Lorentz invariance. More recently Healey\n(2016) has given a different account of how quantum theory may be used\nto explain violations of Bell inequalities consistent with Lorentz\ninvariance and Local Action. This account involves no metaphysical\nholism or nonseparability.\n\nEsfeld (2001) takes holism, in the quantum domain and elsewhere, to\ninvolve more than just a failure of supervenience. He maintains that a\ncompound system is holistic in that its subsystems themselves count as\nquantum systems only by virtue of their relations to other subsystems\ntogether with which they compose the whole.\n",
