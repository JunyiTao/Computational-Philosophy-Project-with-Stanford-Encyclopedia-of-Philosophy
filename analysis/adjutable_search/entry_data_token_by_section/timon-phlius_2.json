    "main_text": "Works || The Shape and Character of the Silloi\n2.1 The Shape and Character of the Silloi\n\nLiterary devices appear to have been extensively employed in the\nSilloi. Diogenes Laertius tells us (9.111) that the\nSilloi was divided into three books. In the first book Timon\nspoke solely in the first person, whereas the second and third took\nthe form of dialogues between Timon himself and the early (late 6th c.\nBCE) philosopher\n Xenophanes.\n Timon is said to have questioned Xenophanes about every\nphilosopher\u2014the older ones in the second book and the more\nrecent in the third book\u2014and Xenophanes answered him. The work\nas a whole, however, was devoted to abuse and ridicule of\nnon-Pyrrhonist philosophers. It looks as if part of the work was\nmodeled after the famous scene in Odyssey Book XI where\nOdysseus visits the underworld; several fragments include the words\n\u2018I saw\u2019 or \u2018I recognized\u2019 (where the person\nseen or recognized is a dead philosopher), and this formula is highly\nreminiscent of Odysseus\u2019 language in describing his encounters\nwith his dead comrades. There are other echoes of Homer as well, most\nnotably from the early books of the Iliad, the effect being\nto represent philosophical disputants as literal combatants. Clayman\n(2009), chapter 3 identifies two other likely scenes:\n\u201cMarketplace of Ideas\u201d in which philosophers are shown\nselling their ideas, and \u201cHyde Park Corner\u201d, in which\nphilosophers address crowds. Clayman, however, convincingly argues\nagainst the hypothesis of a fishing scene, accepted by several earlier\nscholars; the fragments that have been taken to depict philosophers as\nfishers or as fish frequently do not need to be, or even lend\nthemselves especially to being, interpreted in this way.\n\nTimon is indebted for his style and tone in the Silloi to a\ntradition of moralizing diatribe prevalent among the Cynics. The word\ntuphos, \u2018vanity,\u2019 was a favorite Cynic term of\ninvective, and it occurs in several fragments from the\nSilloi, as do a number of related terms. The Cynic Crates\nalso wrote satirical verses; one of the few surviving fragments of\nCrates begins \u201cAnd I saw Stilpo enduring severe pains in\nMegara,\u201d which is a parody of a line from Odyssey XI\nand again seems to assimilate a philosophical encounter to\nOdysseus\u2019 underworld encounters. Crates\u2019 writings may\nwell, then, have been an important influence on the Silloi\n(on this see Long 1978). A more distant inspiration was Xenophanes,\nwho can plausibly be seen as the originator of the genre of\nphilosophical satire in which Timon was writing. (Later sources even\ngive Silloi as the title of a poem by Xenophanes; but it is\nnot clear whether this title was attached to the poem before or only\nafter Timon\u2019s day.) This is surely part of the reason for\nTimon\u2019s choice of Xenophanes as the main character in the second\nand third books.\n\nBut there were philosophical as well as literary reasons for this\nchoice, and this takes us into the question of the outlook projected\nby the poem. In one of the two surviving fragments concerned with\nXenophanes, he is referred to as hupatuphos, \u2018partly\nfree from tuphos.\u2019 Pyrrho is the only one who managed\nto be entirely \u2018free from tuphos\u2019\n(atuphos); but in the highly critical context of the\nSilloi, the epithet hupatuphos already raises\nXenophanes above almost all the other philosophers who appear in the\npoem. The specific point for which Timon singles him out for this\nqualified praise is that he was a \u201cmocker of Homeric\ndeception.\u201d This clearly refers to Xenophanes\u2019 criticism\nof Homer\u2019s (and Hesiod\u2019s) anthropomorphic depiction of the\ngods (in which, among other typically human faults, they engage in\ndeception\u2014Timon\u2019s coinage \u2018of Homeric\ndeception\u2019 (Hom\u00earapat\u00eas) may very well be a\nreflection of this point). This is not to say, however, that Timon\nwholly approves of Xenophanes\u2019 theological stance. For\nXenophanes\u2019 positive view, according to which there is one\nunchanging god, appears to be a target for criticism in the same\nfragment (which is why he qualifies only as partly free from\ntuphos). In fact, it looks as if Timon is suspicious of\ntheological pronouncements of any kind. For in another fragment Timon\n(very unusually among ancient commentators) praises Protagoras for his\nagnostic attitude towards the gods. This is understandable given the\ngeneral framework supplied by Pyrrho; however precisely Pyrrho\u2019s\nthought is interpreted, he clearly rejected physical\nspeculation\u2014and it was under that heading that speculation about\nthe gods was taken, in the Hellenistic period, to belong.\n\nIn another fragment Xenophanes is represented as regretting his\nfailure to \u2018look both ways\u2019 (to be\namphoterobleptos), and so embracing an ill-considered monism.\n(This interpretation of Xenophanes, which assimilates him to the\nEleatics, is highly disputable given the surviving fragments, but was\ncommon in the ancient world.) The ability to \u2018look both\nways\u2019 is therefore presented as a positive characteristic, and\nthis is echoed in two other fragments.\n Zeno of Elea\n is described as \u2018double-tongued\u2019\n(amphoterogl\u00f4ssos)\u2014presumably on the basis of his\nparadoxes arguing for two opposite conclusions\u2014and Democritus is\ndescribed as \u2018two-minded\u2019 (amphinoon); the\ncontexts make clear that these, too, are intended as positive\nappellations. Timon is eager, then, to reject any fixed or one-sided\nview of reality. Again, the precise interpretation of this attitude\nwill depend in part on one\u2019s conception of\nPyrrho\u2019s\u00a0philosophy, as Timon saw it; but the link with a\nPyrrhonist outlook is, at a general level, not hard to see. In the\nsame fragment Xenophanes is also pictured as regretting his failure to\nengage in skeptosun\u00ea. It is tempting to read this as an\nearly occurrence of the notion of skepticism familiar to us from the\nlater Pyrrhonist (or Neo-Pyrrhonist) Sextus Empiricus. But there is no\nclear reason for doing so; the term may just mean\n\u2018inquiry\u2019 in the usual sense, and Xenophanes may simply be\nbemoaning his inadequate investigation of things.\n\nZeno is not the only Eleatic thinker to receive favorable treatment in\nthe Silloi. Timon calls Parmenides \u2018high-minded\u2019\nand \u2018not full of opinions,\u2019 and says that he\n\u201celevated our thought-processes from the deception of\nappearance.\u201d This clearly refers to Parmenides\u2019 rejection\nof ordinary common-sense views of reality, and of the senses as an\nadequate guide to the nature of reality; and it is no doubt on the\nsame grounds that Parmenides\u2019 follower Melissus is described as\n\u201cabove many illusions and yielding to few.\u201d This, of\ncourse, indicates that Melissus did go wrong in certain respects, but\nthat is not surprising. As was suggested in the previous paragraph,\nTimon would have had little sympathy for the Eleatics\u2019 positive\ndoctrines; he regards them as valuable because they refuse to accept\nany simple-minded conception according to which things are as they\nseem.\n\nAs was mentioned in the previous section, Timon\u2019s picture of\nArcesilaus, in three surviving fragments of the Silloi,\nappears wholly uncomplimentary; although the imagery in these\nfragments (shorn of their surrounding context) is not entirely\nperspicuous, the general impression seems to be of an unoriginal and\nself-important fool. This may seem surprising given the points just\nmentioned; one might have expected that Arcesilaus\u2019 skepticism\nwould have struck Timon as highly congenial. However, there do clearly\nseem to have been some differences in temperament and approach between\nArcesilaus and Pyrrho; and this may be a case (of a kind common in\nintellectual history) where broad common ground led to especially\nintense rivalry over differences that, from an outsider\u2019s\nperspective, might have seemed insignificant.\n\nWe only have one fragment specifically cited from the Silloi\nin which Pyrrho himself is the subject; one other about Pyrrho is\nregularly and probably correctly assigned to the Silloi, and\nthe same is true of a third fragment about Pyrrho\u2019s follower\nPhilo. In all three fragments (as in the fragment on Pyrrho from the\nIndalmoi) the emphasis is on the attainment of a supremely\ntranquil disposition. This tranquility is associated with a refusal to\nbe involved in detailed speculations about the universe, and also with\nnot engaging in contentious disputes with philosophical opponents. (By\ncontrast, several other fragments about non-Pyrrhonists berate them\nfor their contentiousness.) But these fragments give few if any clues\nabout the specifics of Pyrrho\u2019s (or Timon\u2019s) thought. The\naim in the Silloi is clearly to evoke a certain kind of ideal\nattitude rather than to detail the means of attaining that\nattitude.\n\nThis is not to say, however, that the Silloi has no concern\nfor philosophical detail. We have seen that Timon\u2019s remarks\nabout those philosophers of whom he partially approves often point to\nspecific views of theirs as worthy of praise or criticism. Similarly,\nmany of the fragments on philosophers with whom he has no sympathy\npick on some central point in their philosophies as material for\ncaricature\u2014Mind in the case of\n Anaxagoras,\n for example, or the four basic elements in the case of\n Empedocles.\n The surviving fragments include portraits of most of the major Greek\nphilosophers up to and including Timon\u2019s time; like good\npolitical cartoons, they are sharply drawn and often savagely witty.\nIndeed, it is arguable that the intensity of the implied criticism in\nthese fragments is at odds with the calm demeanor, and the lack of\nconcern with competitive philosophical debate, that Timon elsewhere\ncelebrates in Pyrrho. Timon may have been an effective spokesman for\nPyrrho\u2019s outlook, but it is not clear that he entirely succeeds\nin exemplifying it himself.\n",
