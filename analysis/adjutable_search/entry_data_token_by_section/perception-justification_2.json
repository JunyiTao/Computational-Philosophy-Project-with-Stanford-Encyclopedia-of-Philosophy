    "main_text": "Theories of Experience || Raw Feel Theories\n1.2 Raw Feel Theories\n\nAccording to sense-data theories, all visual experiences relate us to\nobjects with the properties attributed by our visual experiences. At\nan opposite extreme, one might hold that experiences are \u201craw\nfeels\u201d, failing to present the world to us in any way. To get a\nfeel for this line of thought, consider the experience of\n\u201cseeing stars\u201d. According to some views, your experience\nhere is a mere sensation, failing to present your surroundings to you\n(cf. Smith 2002: 130\u20131). On these views, the expression of\n\u201cseeing stars\u201d is extremely misleading here, as you do not\nliterally see stars, and do not even figuratively see anything\nelse\u2014it is not as if your experience is of anything in the\nscene. According to raw feel theory, all visual experiences are in\nfact like this, not just exceptional ones. As Bonjour puts it, we\ncapture what our visual experiences are like \u201cin terms of\npatches of color arranged in two-dimensional visual space\u201d\n(2001: 32). (For a survey of views that could fall under the heading\nof \u201craw feel theory\u201d as used here, see entry on\n contents of perception\n (section 2.1).\n\nIn a passage from \u201cA Coherence Theory of Truth and\nKnowledge\u201d, Donald Davidson can be read as using raw feel theory\nto argue for a skeptical epistemological conclusion:\n\n\nThe relation between a sensation and a belief cannot be logical, since\nsensations are not beliefs or other propositional attitudes. What then\nis the relation? The answer is, I think, obvious: the relation is\ncausal. Sensations cause some beliefs and in this sense are the basis\nor ground of those beliefs. But a causal explanation of a belief does\nnot show how or why the belief is justified. (1986: 310)\n\n\nBy itself, the view that experiences are raw feels is silent about\nwhether experiences are able to justify beliefs about the external\nworld. To get to conclusions about epistemology, some sort of linking\nprinciple is needed. Davidson\u2019s idea is that a source can supply\njustification only if it has propositional content, so that the source\nis assessable as accurate or inaccurate, depending on whether the\nrelevant proposition is true. On this way of setting up the issues, an\nexperience has \u201cpropositional content\u201d by having content\nthat is assessable for truth (for further elaboration of the idea that\nexperiences have propositional content, see the entry on\n the contents of perception).\n Given Davidson\u2019s demand, experiences would be unable to justify\nbeliefs if they were merely raw feels or sensations. (For important\nprecedents to Davidson here, see Sellars 1956 and Popper 1959: chapter\n5. For further contemporary discussion, see Bonjour 1985; McDowell\n1994; Brewer 1999; and Pryor 2005.).\n\nWe can sketch the issues raised by Davidson with the following\ninstance of our trio:\n\nEpistemology\n\nExperiences justify beliefs about the external world.\n\nEpistemology-Mind Link 3\n\nIf experiences justify beliefs about the external world, then\nexperiences have propositional content.\n\nMind 2\n\nExperiences are raw feels without propositional content.\n\nThe Davidsonian response to the trio is to accept E-M Link 3 and Mind\n2, but to deny Epistemology.\n\nA different response to the trio accepts E-M Link3, but uses\nEpistemology to reject Mind 2. This position was occupied by McDowell\n1994 and Brewer 1999 (although they later revised their views in\nBrewer 2006 and McDowell 2009).\n\nLet us focus on debate about E-M Link 3, the common ground between\nDavidson, McDowell and Brewer. It can be resisted by raw feel\ntheorists, as well as by non-raw feel theorists who fall short of\nattributing propositional contents to experiences.\n\nWhy believe E-M Link 3 at all? Davidson\u2019s own case appeals to\nthe claim that, in order for an experience to justify a belief, the\nexperience must make more probable or entail the content of the belief\n(he also uses the further assumption that only propositional contents\ncan do any such thing). It\u2019s not clear why all raw feel\ntheorists must accept the demand. Think back to the experience of\n\u201cseeing stars\u201d, and suppose that the experience is indeed\na raw feel. The experience might still justify the belief that you are\nhaving that particular experience. Analogously, if pains are best\nunderstood as raw feels, they arguably could still justify you in\nbelieving that you have them. Now, if experiences could lack\npropositional contents and still justify you in believing you have\nthem, why couldn\u2019t they still also justify beliefs about the\nexternal world? In particular, at least if background beliefs are\nallowed to play a role, it seems perfectly possible for beliefs about\nthe external world to be justified thanks to the availability of\ninferences linking particular raw feels with particular conditions of\nthe external world. The justificatory structure here would look like\nthis:\n\n\\[ \\begin{array}{ccc} \\left. \\begin{array}{ccc} \\text{raw feel} &\n\\rightarrow & \\text{self-ascription of raw feel} \\\\ & & +\n\\\\ & & \\text{auxiliary belief}\\end{array} \\right\\} &\n\\rightarrow & \\text{external world belief} \\end{array} \\]\n\n\n(For a contemporary view with this sort of structure, see Bonjour\n2001).\n\nOne also might try to meet the spirit of the demand that justifiers\nincrease probability or entail without attributing propositional\ncontents to experiences. Here it\u2019s important to note the rich\nrange of ways in which experiences might be directed at the world.\nMany of these ways need not involve propositional content.\n\nFirst, even if experiences lack contents that are assessable for\ntruth, experiences might still have contents that are assessable for\naccuracy. Burge 2010 suggests that experiences have non-propositional\ncontents of the form \u2018that \\(F\\)\u2019, and are\naccurate just in case the referent has the property \\(F\\).\nAlternatively, consider how a map or picture might\nbe accurate or inaccurate without being true or false. When\nexperiences are accurate in either of these ways, other contents of\nbeliefs will be true. So experiences could lack propositional\ncontents, but still count as close enough to entailing the contents of\nbeliefs or to increasing the probability of the contents of\nbeliefs.\n\nSecond, experiences might lack contents altogether, and not be\nassessable for truth or accuracy, but still be related in important\nways to relations to the world such as seeing (Campbell 2002; McDowell\n2009; Brewer 2006, 2011). According to these approaches that resist\nthe ascription of content to experiences, your experience justifies a\nbelief about the world only when your experience is a case of seeing\nthe world as it is. You can see the world as it is only if it is in\nfact that way. Here many of your experiences might be supremely\npositioned to justify whether or not they have any content. (For more\nabout such approaches,\n see subsection 2.2.).\n\nIn sum, raw feel theorists might be in a good position to reject E-M\nLink 3. Moreover, even if experiences are not raw feels, they might\nalso lack propositional contents, and still be directed at the world\nin a way that helps them to justify beliefs.\n",
