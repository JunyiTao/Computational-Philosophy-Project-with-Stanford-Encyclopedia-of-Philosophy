This can be\ndescribed as a matter of self-legislation, since each person is viewed\nin effect as herself legislating these norms to serve as requirements\non all agents. On this view, as Kantians develop it, the content of\neveryone\u2019s \u201cself-legislation\u201d must be the same,\nassuming relevantly similar circumstances. For the view assumes that\nthere are standards of rational willing that constrain what anyone\ncould will to serve as requirements incumbent on all agents.\n\nWhether such an account can succeed in providing a constitutive\nexplanation of normativity depends on whether the normativity of these\nstandards of rational willing can be given a constitutive explanation.\nFor these standards are viewed as normative constraints on willing,\nand rationality here is taken to be normative. So if the nature of\nnormativity is what we are trying to explain, we haven\u2019t\nsucceeded if our account rests on the assumption that there are\nnormative constraints on willing.\n",
