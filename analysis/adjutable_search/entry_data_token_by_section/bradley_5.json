    "main_text": "Logic\n6. Metaphysics\n\nAfter the completion of The Principles of Logic, Bradley\nturned to the task of giving a full account of his metaphysics. The\nresult was Appearance and Reality (1893). But Bradley was\nphilosophically active for a further thirty years thereafter,\ncontinuing to elucidate, defend and refine his views, and engaging\nwith critics and rivals (notably, and revealingly for both sides, with\nRussell). Concentration upon Appearance and Reality alone,\ntherefore, risks placing undue weight upon what turn out to be\ntemporary features of thought or expression, and this has in fact\ncontributed to the distorted impressions of his thinking so often to\nbe found in the textbooks of analytic philosophy.\n\nAppearance and Reality is divided into two books. The first,\n\u2018Appearance\u2019, is brief, and its aim destructive, arguing\nthat \u2018the ideas by which we try to understand the\nuniverse\u2019 all bring us ultimately to contradictions when we try\nto think out their implications. Some of these ideas belong especially\nto philosophy, such as the view that only the primary qualities are\nreal and the Kantian notion of a thing-in-itself; others, for instance\nthe notions of cause, motion, self, space, thing and time, are\ndeployed in everyday life. The second book, \u2018Reality\u2019, is\nlong; its aim is to provide a positive account of the Absolute \u2014\nthe ultimate, unconditioned reality as it is in itself, not distorted\nby projection through the conceptual mechanisms of thought. A large\nproportion of his discussion is devoted to consideration of natural\nobjections to this positive account.\n\nMuch of Book I involves presentation of familiar suggestions which\nmake only part of Bradley\u2019s case: he alleges, for example, that\nmotion involves paradoxes, and that primary qualities alone cannot\ngive us reality, for they are inconceivable without secondary\nqualities, and that the notion of the thing-in-itself is\nself-contradictory, for if we really know nothing about it, then not\neven that it exists. But Chapters II and III \u2014 respectively\nentitled \u2018Substantive and Adjective\u2019 and \u2018Relation\nand Quality\u2019, are uniquely Bradleian, alarming in the breadth of\ntheir implications, and have caused intermittent controversy ever\nsince. In generalized form, Bradley\u2019s contention is that\nrelations (such as greater than) are unintelligible either\nwith or without terms, and, likewise, terms unintelligible either with\nor without relations. Bradley himself says of the arguments he wields\nin support of this contention (p. 29),\n\nThe reader who has followed and has grasped the principle of this\nchapter, will have little need to spend his time on those which\nsucceed it. He will have seen that our experience, where relational,\nis not true; and he will have condemned, almost without a hearing, the\ngreat mass of phenomena.\n\n\nIt is clear that his views on relations are both highly controversial\nand central to his thought. In view of this, it would appear a serious\ntactical error on Bradley\u2019s part to present his arguments so\nsketchily and unconvincingly that even sympathetic commentators have\nnot found it easy to defend him, while C.D. Broad was able to say\nlater, \u2018Charity bids us avert our eyes from the pitiable\nspectacle of a great philosopher using an argument which would\ndisgrace a child or a savage\u2019 (Examination, p. 85).\n\nIn spite of Bradley\u2019s laconic style, however, the exegetical\nerrors of his critics are hard to justify. The impression that\nBradley\u2019s crucial metaphysical arguments are negligible arises\nin part from reading them as designed to prove the doctrine of the\ninternality of all relations \u2014 that is, either (1) their\nreducibility to qualities, or (2) their holding necessarily, depending\non the sense of \u2018internal\u2019, Russell having interpreted the\ndoctrine in the former way, Moore in the latter. Whichever sense we\ntake, this is a misreading \u2014 and an impossible one, if we take\n\u2018internal\u2019 in Russell\u2019s sense, because of\nBradley\u2019s rejection of the subject/predicate account of judgment\nas \u2018erroneous\u2019. If, however, we use Moore\u2019s sense of\n\u2018internal\u2019, the reading is understandable, albeit still\ninexcusable: in Chapter III Bradley confusingly applies this word to\nrelations in a metaphysically innocent way which has no connection\nwith the doctrine of internality as this is understood by Moore, while\nin other parts of Appearance and Reality he openly flirts\nwith the doctrine of internality, repudiating it clearly only in later\nworks less often read, such as the important essay\n\u2018Relations\u2019 left incomplete at his death and published in\nhis Collected Essays of 1935. Further, Bradley does uniformly\nreject the reality of external relations, and it is easy, though not\nlogically inevitable, to interpret this as a commitment to the\ndoctrine of internality.\n\nBradley\u2019s treatment of relations originates in Chapter II with a\ndiscussion of the problem of what makes the unity of an individual\nthing. How can we make sense of the fact that a single thing,\nsuch as, say, a lump of sugar, is capable of holding a\nplurality of different properties into a unity, such as its\nsweetness, whiteness and hardness? We cannot postulate the existence\nof an underlying substance distinct from its qualities, for this would\ncommit us to the existence of a naked, bare particular, the absurd\nconception of a something devoid of all qualities. Moreover, the\noriginal difficulty as to the unity of the thing is left unsolved by\nthis move, since it becomes possible to ask what it is that binds the\nqualities to their substance. The alternative is to conceive the thing\nas a collection of qualities, yet what is the nature of the\nontological tie that binds them into the unity of the thing? We are\nleft with an aggregate of independent, substance-like\nqualities, rather than with an individual thing. At this\npoint, the problem of relations emerges in its full ontological\nsignificance, for it now looks as if only a relation could provide the\nrequired nexus.\n\nBradley\u2019s considered view in Chapter III is that neither\nexternal nor internal relations possess unifying power and must\ntherefore be rejected as unreal. This is the proper conclusion of a\nset of condensed arguments which he deploys as a team, systematically\nexcluding the possible positions available to those who would\ndisagree. One crucial consideration is based upon the insight that a\nrelation is the \u2018ground\u2019 of its terms as well as\n\u2018founded\u2019 upon them. \u2018So far as I can see\u2019, he\nsays, \u2018relations must depend upon terms, just as much as terms\nupon relations\u2019 (Appearance, p. 26). The relation is\nsaid to \u2018depend\u2019 upon its terms, because it requires at\nleast two terms in order to exist; and terms \u2018depend\u2019 upon\nrelations, because they are partly constituted by the relationships in\nwhich they stand to one another (albeit Bradley provides no\nillustration, this can be made plausible by considering two different\nshades of colour: blue would not be blue, if it were not darker than\nyellow). Once this is recognized, Bradley goes on to argue, one sees\nthat a related term A is really made up of two parts, one\nfunctioning as the foundation of the relation, A1, and the\nother determined by it, A2. Thus, each related term turns out\nto be a relational complex, in this specific case, A turning\nout to be the complex R(A1,A2). This\nlaunches a regress, for by the same logic A1 and A2\nwill have to be made up of two distinct parts, and so on without\nend.\n\nThe member of Bradley\u2019s team of arguments which has attracted\nthe greatest polemical attention, however, is the one which alleges\nthat if a relation were a further kind of real thing along with its\nterms (as, e.g., Russell later assumed in his multiple relation theory\nof judgment), then a further relation would be required to relate it\nto its terms, and so on ad infinitum. It is clear from this\nargument (which is an obvious descendant of The Principles of\nLogic\u2019s attack on the traditional analysis of judgment), as\nwell as from his own explanation, that for him \u2018real\u2019 is a\ntechnical term: to be real is to be an individual substance (in the\nsense commonly found in Descartes, Leibniz and Spinoza). On this\nunderstanding, to deny the reality of relations is to deny that they\nare independent existents. It is this argument which explains\nreactions like Broad\u2019s: in common with others, he took Bradley\nto be assuming that relations are a kind of object, when what Bradley\nwas doing was arguing by a kind of reductio against that very\nassumption.\n\nThese remarks make it clear that Bradley is using the term\n\u2018appearance\u2019 in an ontological sense, as referring to what\nlacks full individuality, rather than in an epistemological sense, as\nreferring to what is present to a subject. And indeed, he does not\nwish to deny the obvious fact that we experience a rich diversity of\nthings; relations and plurality in some sense exist, and\ntherefore belong to reality. The denial of the reality of relations\ndoes not imply their absolute non-existence; rather, his conclusion is\nthat relations and terms should be conceived as aspects within an\nall-embracing whole. Instead of ascribing to Bradley the doctrine of\ninternality, it would therefore be better to see him as advocating a\n\u2018holistic\u2019 theory of relations. As against Russell,\nBradley was wholly explicit on this fundamental point:\n\nThis is the doctrine for which I have now for so many years contended.\nRelations exists only in and through a whole which can not\n[sic] in the end be resolved into relations and terms.\n\u2018And\u2019, \u2018together\u2019 and \u2018between\u2019,\nare all in the end senseless apart from such a whole. The opposite\nview is maintained (as I understand) by Mr. Russell... But for myself,\nI am unable to find that Mr. Russell has ever really faced the\nquestion. (Principles, 2nd edn, Ch. II, additional note 50).\n\n\nInterestingly, one philosopher who faced Bradley\u2019s question\nsquarely was Russell\u2019s pupil, Wittgenstein. In his\nTractatus he tried to avoid Bradley\u2019s regresses by\ngetting rid of relations. His simple objects do enter into the\nformation of unified facts, yet no extraneous connecting principle is\nrequired:\u2018In the atomic fact objects hang one in another, like\nthe links of a chain.\u2019 (2.03). The metaphor of a chain, however,\nprovides no real answer to the problem raised by Bradley, especially\nso in light of the fact that it is all but clear that\nWittgenstein\u2019s logico-ontological atoms can be said to possess a\nform; surely, they differ from Democritean atoms in that they lack\nmaterial properties (cf. 2.0331 and 2.0232). Moreover, Bradley could\nstill argue that the very idea of two distinct but unrelated objects\nmakes little sense.\n\nThe implications of Bradley\u2019s treatment of relations are not\nsolely metaphysical; they are also epistemological. Some have thought\nthat the denial of the reality of relations amounts to the assertion\nthat all relational judgments are false, so that it is, for example,\nnot true that 7 is greater than 3 or that hydrogen is lighter than\noxygen. Such an interpretation is made credible by Bradley\u2019s\naccount of truth, for on that account no ordinary judgment is ever\nperfectly true; in consequence, to one who reads him under the\ninfluence of the later but anachronistic assumption that truth is\ntwo-valued, his claim appears to be that relational judgments are all\nfalse. On Bradley\u2019s account of truth, however, while for\nordinary purposes it is true that 7 is greater than 3 and false that\noxygen is lighter than hydrogen, once we try to meet the more exacting\ndemands of metaphysics we are forced to recognize that truth admits\ndegrees and that, while the former is undoubtedly more true than the\nlatter, it is not fully true. The imperfection of even the more true\nof these judgments, though, is nothing to do with the its being\nrelational rather than predicative. For, as was observed above in the\nsection on Logic, Bradley thought all judgments to be defective in\nthat representation can proceed only on the basis of separating in\nthought what is not separate in reality: when, for example, we say\n\u2018These apples are hard and sour\u2019, we not only implicitly\nabstract the apples from their container but detach the hardness and\nsourness from each other and abstract them from the apples themselves.\nA perfect truth, one completely faithful to reality, would thus have\nto be one which did not abstract from reality at all; and this means\nthat it would have to be identical with the whole of reality and\naccordingly no longer even a judgment. The final truth about reality\nis, on Bradley\u2019s view, quite literally and in principle\ninexpressible. Eventually, it is this mystical conclusion which\nexplains his forceful rejection of Hegel\u2019s panlogism;\ncontrary to Hegel\u2019s view in the Science of Logic,\nReality is not a system of interrelated logical categories, but\ntranscends thought altogether.\n\nIt is, however, possible to give an outline. The impression of\nreality\u2019s consisting of a multiplicity of related objects is a\nresult of the separations imposed by thought; in fact \u2018the\nAbsolute is not many; there are no independent reals.\u2019 (All\nquotations from here on are from Appearance and Reality, Ch.\nXIV.) Reality is one \u2014 but one what? Experience, he says, in a\nwide sense of the term: \u2018Feeling, thought and volition (any\ngroups under which we class psychological phenomena) are all the\nmaterial of existence, and there is no other material, actual or even\npossible.\u2019 The immediate argument he gives for this unintuitive\ndoctrine is brief to the point of offhandedness, merely challenging\nthe reader to think otherwise without self-contradiction; his greater\nconcern is to make it quite clear that this experience does not belong\nto any individual mind, and his doctrine not a form of solipsism. But\nhe is not quite as offhand as he appears, for he soon makes clear that\nhe thinks the whole book to be a best-explanation argument for this\nobjective (or absolute) idealism: \u2018This conclusion will, I\ntrust, at the end of my work bring more conviction to the reader; for\nwe shall find that it is the one view which will harmonize all\nfacts.\u2019\n\nSo \u2018the Absolute is one system, and ... its contents are nothing\nbut sentient experience. It will hence be a single and all-inclusive\nexperience, which embraces every partial diversity in concord. For it\ncannot be less than appearance, and hence no feeling or thought, of\nany kind, can fall outside its limits.\u2019 But how can we\nunderstand this diversity to be possible, when it cannot be accounted\nfor through terms and relations? Bradley\u2019s answer is that we\ncannot understand this in detail, but can get some grasp on what he\nmeans by considering a pre-conceptual state of immediate experience in\nwhich there are differences but no separations, a state from which our\nfamiliar, cognitive, adult human consciousness arises by imposing\nconceptual distinctions upon the differences. Reality is like this\nprimitive state, but not exactly like, for it transcends thought\nrather than falls short of it, and everything, even conceptual thought\nitself, is included in one comprehensive and harmonious whole.\nAppearances thus contribute to Reality in a fashion analogous to the\nways in which segments of a painting contribute to the whole work of\nart: detached from their background, they would lose their\nsignificance and might in isolation even be ugly; in context, they can\nthemselves be beautiful and make an essential contribution to the\nbeauty and integrity of the whole.\n\nSuch limited comparisons are all the help we can get in understanding\nthe Absolute and its relation to its appearances: Bradley rejects as\nimpossible the demand for detailed explanations of how phenomena like\nerror and evil belong to the Absolute, instead trying to shift the\nburden of proof to critics who express confidence in their\nincompatibility. His general answer is that anything that exists, even\nthe worst of evils, is somehow real: the Absolute must comprehend both\nevil and good. But, just as truth admits of degrees, a judgment being\nless true the further it is from comprehending the whole of reality,\nso (consistent with \u2018the identity of truth knowledge and\nreality\u2019) reality itself admits of degrees, a phenomenon being\nthe less real the more it is just a fragmentary aspect of the whole.\nThe Absolute is in such a way further from evil than from good, but is\nitself neither, transcending them both as it transcends even religion\n\u2014 it is in a sense a Supreme Being, but not a personal God. The\nproper object of a complete system of metaphysics should be that of\nadjudicating the relative degree of reality of any fragmentary\nexistent, yet as some critics objected, it is difficult to see how\nthis could be carried out even in principle, given Bradley\u2019s\ncontention that the Absolute is, strictly speaking, unknowable.\n\nBradley also devotes some time to a consideration of issues that arise\nin the philosophy of nature; albeit it is evident that he feels the\nattraction of panpsychism, this is a view he never explicitly\nendorses. As T.S. Eliot recognized, a Leibnizian strand pervades\nBradley\u2019s philosophy, one which finds expression in his doctrine\nof finite centres of experience. On this view, the Absolute\narticulates itself in a plurality of lesser sentient wholes, unified\npsychical individuals of the nature of the human soul. Bradley thus\ncomes close to holding something very like a theory of monads, yet\nthis is incorporated within the general framework of his monistic\nmetaphysics. Interestingly, the doctrine of the Absolute can be seen\nas a solution to the problem of monadic interaction; like\nLeibniz\u2019s monads, Bradley\u2019s finite centres are incapable\nof a direct sharing of content (e.g., they are said to be \u2018not\ndirectly pervious to each other\u2019; Appearance, p. 464)\nand of causal interaction; however, they are coordinated to one\nanother in that they are all partial manifestations of the same\noverarching Reality. A similar attempt at reconciling Absolute\nIdealism and monadism had been made by Lotze, and in both cases it\nremains an open question whether this is not pre-established harmony\nin disguise. What is clear but usually overlooked is that Bradley\nhimself saw Leibnizian monadism as the greatest challenge to his own\nbrand of idealism: \u2018Monadism\u2019, he says, \u2018on the\nwhole will increase and will add to the difficulties which already\nexist\u2019 (Appearance, p. 102). He was surely right in\nthis, as later British metaphysicians \u2014 such as James Ward,\nJ.M.E. McTaggart, Herbert Wildon Carr, and Alfred North Whitehead\n\u2014 preferred Leibniz over Kant and Hegel as their main source of\ninspiration.\n\nIn Bradley\u2019s often rhapsodic descriptions of the Absolute, a\nconception of the world based both on his sceptical scrutiny of the\ninadequacies of philosophers\u2019 accounts of judgment \u2014 and,\nit is clear, on a kind of personal experience of a higher unity which\nin another context might have made him one of the world\u2019s\nrevered religious mystics \u2014, we can see why, at the start of\nthis article, his metaphysics was described as \u2018a striking\ncombination of the rational and the mystical\u2019. The very\nidiosyncrasy of this combination has meant that few subsequent\nphilosophers have been convinced by it. Nevertheless, in its bold and\ndirect confrontation of what he called \u2018the great problem of the\nrelation between Thought and Reality\u2019, it stands in Western\nphilosophy as a permanent and unsettling challenge to the capacity of\ndiscursive thought to display the world without distortion; unsettling\nbecause it arises, not from the imposition of an external standard\nwhich could be rejected as arbitrary or inappropriate, but from the\ndemand that our mechanisms of representation meet the standards they\nthemselves implicitly set.\n",
