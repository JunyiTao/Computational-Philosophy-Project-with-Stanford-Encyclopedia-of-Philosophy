    "main_text": "Hypothetical theories of ability || Problems for the conditional analysis\n3.2 Problems for the conditional analysis\n\n(CA) says that satisfying a certain conditional is both sufficient and\nnecessary for having a certain ability. There are two kinds of\ncounterexamples that may be brought against (CA): counterexamples to\nits sufficiency, and to its necessity. Let us take these in turn.\n\nCounterexamples to the sufficiency of (CA) have been most\nprominent in the literature. Informally, they are suggested by the\nquestion: \u2018but could S try to A?\u2019 There\nare a variety of ways of translating this rhetorical question into a\ncounterexample. We may distinguish two: global\ncounterexamples, according to which (CA) might always get the\nfacts about ability wrong, and local counterexamples,\naccording to which (CA) might sometimes get the facts about\nability wrong.\n\nBegin with global counterexamples. Let us say that\ndeterminism is true at our world. Familiar arguments purport\nto show that, if this is the case, then no one has the ability to do\nanything, except perhaps for what she actually does (for several\ndevelopments of such an argument, see van Inwagen 1983, 55\u2013105).\nBut if (CA) is true, then agents would have the ability to perform\nvarious actions that they do not actually perform. For it is plausible\nthat the conditionals in terms of which (CA) analyzes ability would\nstill be true in a deterministic world. But then, since it makes false\npredictions about such a world, which for all we know may be our own,\n(CA) is false.\n\nThe difficulties involved in this sort of counterexample are clear.\nThe proponent of (CA) will reject the arguments for the\nincompatibility of ability and determinism as unsound. Indeed, it is\nprecisely her thought that such arguments are unsound that has\ntypically led her to take ability to be analyzed in terms like those\nof (CA). So global counterexamples, while they may be successful, are\ndialectically ineffective relative to the range of questions\nthat are at issue in the debates over ability.\n\nIt seems, however, that we can show that (CA) is false even relative\nto premises that are shared between various disputants in the free\nwill debates. This is what is shown by local counterexamples\nto (CA). One such example is given by Keith Lehrer:\n\nSuppose that I am offered a bowl of candy and in the bowl are small\nround red sugar balls. I do not choose to take one of the red sugar\nballs because I have a pathological aversion to such candy. (Perhaps\nthey remind me of drops of blood and \u2026 ) It is logically\nconsistent to suppose that if I had chosen to take the red sugar ball,\nI would have taken one, but, not so choosing, I am utterly unable to\ntouch one. (Lehrer 1968, 32)\n\n\nSuch an example shows that (CA) is false without assuming anything\ncontentious in debates over freedom. It turns rather on a simple\npoint: that psychological shortcomings, just as much as external\nimpediments, may undermine abilities. (CA), which does not recognize\nthis point, is therefore subject to counterexamples where such\npsychological shortcomings become relevant. We may, if we like,\ndistinguish \u2018psychological\u2019 from\n\u2018non-psychological\u2019 ability, and claim that (CA) correctly\naccounts for the latter (this sort of strategy is suggested, for\nexample, by Albritton 1985). But our ordinary notion of ability, that\nof which we are attempting to give a theory, seems to involve\nboth psychological and non-psychological requirements. And if\nthat is correct, then Lehrer\u2019s example succeeds as a\ncounterexample to (CA) as a theory of our ordinary notion of\nability.\n\nCounterexamples to the necessity of (CA) have been less\nfrequently discussed (though see Wolf 1990), but they also raise\nimportant issues about ability. Consider a case where a good golfer\nmisses an easy putt. Given that this golfer tried to make the putt and\nfailed to, it is false that she would have made the putt if she had\ntried to; after all, she did try it and did not make it.\n(This thought is vindicated by standard views of subjunctive\nconditionals; see Bennett 2003, 239). But, as a good golfer, she\npresumably had the ability to make the putt. So this seems to be a\ncase where one can have an ability without satisfying the relevant\nconditional, and hence a counterexample to the necessity of (CA).\n\nHere the defender of (CA) might avail herself of the distinction\nbetween specific and general abilities. (CA), she might say, is an\naccount of what it is to have a specific ability: that is, to actually\nbe in a position to perform an action. The golfer does lack\nthis ability in this case, as (CA) correctly predicts. It is\nnonetheless true that the golfer has the general ability to\nsink putts like this. But (CA) does not purport to be an analysis of\ngeneral ability, and as such is compatible with the golfer having that\nsort of ability. Again, the plausibility of this response will hang on\nthe viability of the distinction between specific and general\nabilities.\n\nWe have seen that (CA) faces serious problems, especially as a\nsufficient condition for ability, even once we set to one\nside contentious claims about freedom and determinism. If this is\ncorrect, then (CA) must either be modified or rejected outright. Let\nus first consider the prospects for modification.\n",
