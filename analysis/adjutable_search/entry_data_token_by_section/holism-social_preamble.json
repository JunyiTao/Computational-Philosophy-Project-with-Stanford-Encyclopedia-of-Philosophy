    "main_text": "\n\nThe debate between methodological holists and methodological\nindividualists concerns the proper focus of explanations in the social\nsciences: to what extent should social scientific explanations revolve\naround social phenomena and individuals, respectively? The discussion\ntakes two main forms.\n\nThe most enduring debate surrounds the issue of dispensability.\nMethodological holists engaged in this debate defend the view that\nexplanations that invoke social phenomena (e.g., institutions, social\nstructures or cultures) should be offered within the social sciences:\ntheir use is indispensable. Explanations of this sort are variously\nreferred to as holist, collectivist, social (-level), or macro\n(-level) explanations. They are exemplified by claims such as\n\u201cthe unions protested because the government wanted to lower the\nnational minimum wage\u201d, or \u201cthe rise in unemployment led\nto a higher crime rate\u201d. Holist explanations may be contrasted\nwith explanations that are expressed in terms of individuals, their\nactions, beliefs, desires, and the like. The latter are variously\ntermed individualist, individual (-level), or micro (-level)\nexplanations. They are illustrated by claims such as \u201cAnna baked\na cake because Susan wanted it\u201d, or\n\n\nas a result of individuals a, b, c, etc.\nlosing their jobs, and feeling very frustrated about having little\nmoney and no job opportunities, the crime rate went up.\n\n\nMethodological holists may or may not hold that individualist\nexplanations should be offered in addition to holist explanations.\nWhatever methodological holists\u2019 stand on this issue, they are\nopposed by methodological individualists who insist that individualist\nexplanations alone should be provided within the social sciences, and\nthus, that holist explanations should be dispensed with.\n\nThe other, more recent dispute between methodological holists and\nindividualists is concerned with the issue of microfoundations.\nMethodological holists involved in this debate defend the view that in\nsome cases, purely holist explanations (i.e., explanations stated\nsolely in terms of social phenomena) may stand on their own: they do\nnot invariably need individual-level microfoundations. A purely holist\nexplanation might be \u201cthe economic depression was the main\nreason why the war broke out\u201d. Methodological holists may\nmaintain that this explanation is fine as it stands; it need not be\nsupplemented with further details specifying how the economic\ndepression incited individuals to adopt certain beliefs, act in\ncertain ways, etc., that in turn led to the outbreak of the war.\nMethodological individualists disagree, insisting that such additional\naccounts must always be provided.\n\nWithin philosophy and the social sciences, whether in the context of\nthe dispensability or the microfoundations debate, proponents of\nmethodological holism do not necessarily describe their position in\nsuch terms. In fact, this is seldom so within the social sciences. In\ncertain cases, some alternative label is used, for example, when\n\u201cexplanatory holism\u201d and \u201ccollectivism\u201d are\nemployed to denote the view that holist explanations are\nindispensable. In other cases, no label at all is attributed to one or\nboth of the views that are here described as methodologically holist.\nIn this entry, differences of terminology will be disregarded: the\nterm \u201cmethodological holism\u201d is used to describe both the\nthesis that holist explanations are indispensable, as well as the\nthesis that purely holist explanations do not always need\nindividual-level microfoundations.\n\nThe methodological individualism-holism debate that concerns the\nproper focus of social scientific explanations is just one among\nseveral individualism-holism disputes. Most notably, there are\nindividualism-holism debates about ontology, confirmation, and\nmorality. Within these discussions, holism is the view that social\nphenomena exist sui generis, or in their own right (the\nontological debate); that social scientific explanations need not\nalways be confirmed by looking at what happens at the level of\nindividuals (the debate on confirmation); and that moral\nresponsibility may sometimes be ascribed to social entities such as\ngroups (one version of the moral debate). It is perfectly possible,\nand in fact quite common, to subscribe to methodological holism in the\nsense defined in this entry without endorsing these other forms of\nholism. Though interesting, these debates will not be directly\naddressed here.\n\nThe following discussion of methodological holism consists of two\nparts. Sections 1 and 2 examine the dispensability debate, and\nSections 3 and 4 consider the microfoundations debate. Both parts\nfocus on methodological holists\u2019 views\u2014and\narguments\u2014in these disputes.
