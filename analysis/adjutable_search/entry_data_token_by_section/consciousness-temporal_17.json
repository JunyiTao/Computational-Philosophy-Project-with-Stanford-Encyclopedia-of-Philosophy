Anti-Realisms\n\nPerhaps there is a more dramatic discrepancy between the actual\ncharacteristics of our experience, on the one hand, and our\nbeliefs about these characteristics on the other, than\nanything we have considered up to now. True, we do talk as though we\nsee things move (and more generally, perceive change), and doubtless\nthis talk reflects our beliefs, but perhaps our beliefs are simply\nwrong. Perhaps our immediate experience is in reality entirely\nmotion-free, and our streams of consciousness radically fragmented,\nbut since we do not believe our experience is like this, we do not\ntalk as though it is.\n\nA position along these lines has been advocated by Dennett. If asked\nwhether our typical visual fields are fully continuous, even when one\nof our eyes is closed, most of us are inclined to answer in the\naffirmative: when we look at (say) a white wall, we see an\nuninterrupted expanse of white. In such cases we are unable to detect\na beachball-sized fuzzy dark expanse lying just to one side of the\ncentral axis of vision. But the physiology of the eye suggests there\nshould be a \u201cblind spot\u201d at that location, corresponding\nto the region of the retina occupied by the optic nerve which is\ndevoid of light-sensitive cells. As for why we do not detect a blind\nregion in our visual field, the standard\u2014and on the face of it,\nplausible\u2014answer is that our visual systems engage in some\n\u201cperceptual interpolation\u201d or filling-in: our\nbrains extrapolate from the stimuli reaching the light-sensitive cells\nin the region of the retina immediately surrounding the blind-spot,\nand fabricate experience to fill the relevant region of the visual\nfield accordingly.\n\nDennett points out that there is alternative to this account. Rather\nthan \u201cmaking up\u201d experience in this manner, perhaps our\nbrains simply fail to notice that there is a lack of visual\ninformation deriving from the hole region: after all, an absence of\ninformation is not the same thing as information about an absence.\nNever having received information from this region, the brain simply\nworks on the assumption that nothing special is going on there:\n\n\nThe brain doesn\u2019t have to \u201cfill in\u201d for the blind\nspot, since the region in which the blind spot falls is already\nlabelled (e.g., \u201cplaid\u201d \u2026 \u201cmore of the\nsame\u201d). (1991: 335)\n\n\nIn effect, since we have a belief about what the blind region\ncontains\u2014typically, \u201cmore of the same\u201d\u2014why\nshould the brain go to the trouble of generating experience as well?\nDennett goes on to suggest that this treatment of spatial holes can\nplausibly be extended to temporal holes (gaps in the continuity of\nexperience) also. Our visual experience is constantly interrupted by\nour eyes darting about during saccades. We don\u2019t notice the\nresulting holes or gaps in our experience, but they don\u2019t need\nto be filled in because we\u2019re not designed to notice them. More\ngenerally:\n\n\nOne of the most striking features of consciousness is its\ndiscontinuity\u2014as revealed in the blind spot, and the\nsaccadic gaps, to take the simplest examples. The discontinuity of\nconsciousness is striking because of the apparent continuity\nof consciousness. (1991: 356)\n\n\nAlthough Dennett himself concentrates on explaining why we are\ninclined to describe our experience as continuous if it is really\ndiscontinuous, the approach can be extended to the immediate\nexperience of change, or so Chuard argues (2011: 17) Suppose the\n\u201csuccession of static snapshots\u201d conception of experience\nas proposed by the cinematic theorist is correct. Provided the\ncontents and temporal arrangement of these static snapshots are enough\nto convince our brains that we are perceiving motion and change, we\nwill inevitably believe that this is what we are perceiving,\nand hence describe our experience in such terms. Isn\u2019t\nthis all that we are required to explain? For Dennett and Chuard\nnothing further is needed.\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a71.3\n it is possible to be a realist about the experience of change and\nsuccession but an anti-realist about the dynamic features that some\nrealists claim to be a pervasive feature of our experience. Thomas\nSattig falls into this camp. Sattig is a realist about the experience\nof change and succession:\n\n\n\u2026 I do not merely infer that the leave has moved, from\nmemories of previously experienced momentary leaf-states. I just\nsee that motion occurs. (Sattig 2019a: 275)\n\n\nSattig doesn\u2019t reject all forms of flow, and has\ndeveloped an account of it grounded in phenomenal\nreplacement:\n\n\n\u2026 I see that each momentary leaf-state is immediately replaced\nby another one like water flowing through a river bed, where each\nportion of water is immediately replaced by a new portion. (Sattig\n2019b: \u00a71)\n\n\nIn reducing the experience of motion to successions of momentary\nperceptions of objects at different locations he appreciates that some\nrealists will find that his account fails to do justice to the dynamic\nnature of phenomenal flow:\n\n\nPrimitivists about the phenomenal whoosh of flow will not\naccept this phenomenological analysis, nor will they accept any other\n\u2026 But I have yet to encounter an alternative phenomenological\ndescription that reaches substantially beyond the usual, opaque\nflow-metaphors. (2019b: \u00a74)\n\n\nOthers are still more sceptical, arguing that realists who believe in\nexperiential flow or passage are deluded about the character of their\nown experience: flow isn\u2019t a real feature of our experience, we\nmerely (and falsely) believe that it is. Hoerl (2014) adopts this\nline, arguing that it is a mistake to suppose that the experience of\nseeing a moving object involves anything more than seeing the object\nat a succession of different locations\u2014also see Braddon-Mitchell\n(2014). In a similar but more general vein K. Miller, Holcombe, and\nLatham (2020) suggest that we may well be inclined to attribute\ndynamic features to our experience which it in fact lacks, and propose\ntwo cognitive mechanisms which may underlie this inclination.\n",
