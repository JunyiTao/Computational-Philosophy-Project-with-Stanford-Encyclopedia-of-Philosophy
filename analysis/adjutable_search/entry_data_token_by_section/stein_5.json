    "main_text": "Phenomenological Ontology and Philosophical Anthropology || The Question of Being\n3.1 The Question of Being\n\nFollowing her conversion in 1922, Stein immersed herself in Christian\nphilosophy, especially St. Thomas Aquinas, translating De\nVeritate (Stein 2008a,b). Having \u201cfound a home in\nAquinas\u2019s thought world\u201d (Stein 1931: 4[3]), but remaining\nloyal to phenomenology, she sought to integrate phenomenology with\nThomism which she did in an original way, connecting Husserl\u2019s\nconcept of spirit (Geist) with the Christian personal God.\nHusserl proceeds from the transcendental standpoint of the meditating\nego, Aquinas\u2019 position is naive realism. Stein, therefore,\ncriticized Husserlian transcendental philosophy for seeking to\nestablish objectivity from within subjectivity (1993: 33[32]). Her\nphenomenological ontology, furthermore, offered a Christian\nalternative (\u201cinfinite Being\u201d) to Heidegger\u2019s\naccount of being as finitude. Stein\u2019s ontology is found\nprimarily in Potency and Act (1931) and Finite and\nEternal Being (1950/2006), both of which contain original\ndiscussions of essence (Wesen) and of being (Sein)\nthat deserve fuller examination over and against Heidegger or\nConrad-Martius\u2019s accounts.\n\nStein defines ontology as the science of the \u201cbasic forms of\nbeing and of beings\u201d (2000c: 161[182]). In agreement with Aquinas\nand Husserl, she holds that ontological concepts can be discovered by\n\u201clogical reasoning\u201d (1931: 17[22]). She begins from\nHusserl\u2019s distinction between formal and material ontologies.\nFormal ontology, for Stein, considers being simply as\n\u201dbeing\u201d, that which is. Thus it arrives at the formal\nnotion of \u201csomething that is\u201d or just\n\u201csomething\u201d (1931: 22[28]). Formal ontology, for Stein,\nfollowing Husserl, studies formal principles such as\n\u201cact\u201d, \u201cpotency\u201d, \u201cobject\u201d,\n\u201cindividual\u201d, and so on. Formal ontology identifies a\npriori conceptual truths such as: \u201conly a perfectly simple whole\ncan be absolutely actual\u201d (1931: 38[52]). Stein identifies three\nfundamental ontological forms: \u201cobject\u201d\n(Gegenstand), \u201cwhat\u201d (Was), and\n\u201cbeing\u201d (Sein; 1931: 99[147]). Stein\ndistinguishes between the species and the concrete individual.\nIndividual entities have \u201cthisness\u201d or haeccitas\n(1931: 29[39]). Invoking Dun Scotus, Stein speaks of\nhaeccitas, and of \u201cindividual essence\u201d\n(Einzelwesen; 1950/2006: 79[81]), a concept she also finds in\nHusserl. Paradoxically, there is an essence that is responsible for\nsomething being an individual, a particular \u201cthis\u201d. Things\nhave a \u201cpossibility of essence\u201d\n(Wesensm\u00f6glichkeit, Stein 1950/2006: 80[83]), the\ncapacity to actualize their nature. For Stein, from consideration of\none\u2019s own being and non-being, one can grasp the notion of\nactuality and possibility and then argue for the possibility\nof full actuality as is found in divine being.\n\nFor Stein, \u201cGod is pure spirit and the archetype of all\nspiritual being\u201d (2003: 127[153]). The essence of divine being\nis to be \u201ctri-personal\u201d (1950/2006: 352). God is\n\u201cBeing-in-Person, indeed the\nBeing-in-three-Persons\u201d (1950/2006: 307[359]). Spirit in\ngeneral, furthermore, is \u201csuperabundant, diffusive life\u201d\n(1950/2006 351[380]). The life of spirit as such is non-spatial\n\u201cmovement\u201d (1931: 117[169]). Spirit is active and dynamic\nand divine being is \u201ca movement from the inside out (\u2026) a\ngenerating being (\u2026) eternal self-drawing and\nself-creating\u201d (Sich-selbst-sch\u00f6pfen; 1950/2006:\n300[351]). All forms of spirit possess \u201cinnerness\u201d\n(Inneres; Stein 1950/2006: 307[360]) and \u201cgoes out from\nitself\u201d. Spirit as such has \u201cself-shaping\u201d power\n(Gestaltungskraft; 1931: 122[175]) and its essence is to be\n\u201cself-giving\u201d. Spirit, for Stein, then, is\n\u201cbeing-in-itself\u201d (Sein in sich selbst),\n\u201cfor itself\u201d, and \u201cfrom itself\u201d (a\nse). All other beings that are spiritual are founded in this\ndivine spirit and have their \u201carchetypes\u201d there\n(Urbilder; 1950/2006: 307[360]). Ultimately, all forms of\nspirit form a unity.\n\nStein defends the reality of essences. An essence is not just a name,\nrather a name is an expression of an essence. Concepts are\nhuman inventions; essences are not (1950/2006: 62[66]). The formation\nof concepts is based on grasping the essences (Stein 1950/2006:\n72[73]). The being of essences, however, is inefficacious and\npotential. What is real or actual is the individual. Stein\u2019s\nexample of essence is \u201cjoy\u201d. Joy becomes actual and\nefficacious because of its essence, which is timeless (1950/2006:\n91[95]). There exists an individual\u2019s joy. There is no such\nthing in the real world as \u201cjoy in general\u201d (1950/2006:\n75[76]); nevertheless, joy has an \u201cessentiality\u201d\n(Wesenheit; 1950/2006: 77[78]) that defines it and\ndistinguishes it from other emotions. Stein claims essences belong to\nobjects (e.g. my joy) but \u201cessentialities\u201d are\nideal and are independent of objects (e.g., joy as such) (1950/2006:\n72[73]). An object without an essence is unthinkable (1950/2006:\n77[78]).\n\nStein, following both Husserl and Scheler, distinguishes between the\ngeneric or universal essence of a human being (the\n\u201cspecies\u201d \u2013 what all humans have in common) and the\nindividual essences of individual human beings. Explicitly departing\nfrom Aquinas, Stein defends the concept of the essence of the\nindividual, the differentiation of individuals through spiritual\nmatter, and the idea of the \u201cunfolding\u201d or\n\u201cblooming\u201d (Entfaltung; 1931: 139[209]) of the\nsoul from its core or seed. In Finite and Eternal Being,\nStein discusses the \u201cindividual essence\u201d\n(individuelles Wesen) of Socrates (1950/2006: 142[157]), a\ndeterminate form distinct from the general, specific form of\nbeing-human. The form of Socrates unfolds within specific\npossibilities contained in its quite determinate essence. The real\nSocrates may be different from the man depicted by Plato.\n\u201cBeing-Socrates\u201d and\n\u201cbeing-the-Platonic-Socrates\u201d are distinct essences,\ndifferent possible \u201cforms\u201d of unfolding of what Socrates\nis (1950/2006: 142\u2013143[157\u2013158]). The essence\nunfolds itself in its faculties and capacities (later called\nits \u201cpotentiality\u201d). Stein distinguishes between\n\u201cunfolding\u201d (Entfaltung) and\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d (Entwicklung). A person\nunfolds from an essence that is already there. Development\nrefers to other kinds of movement, including the Darwinian idea of\nevolution, with which Stein (and also Scheler) was broadly familiar\nand which she discussed in her anthropology.\n\nStein further distinguishes between \u201cspecies\u201d (understood\nas Aquinas\u2019 \u201cforms\u201d which are permanent and\nunalterable categories (2000c: 151[173]), and what she calls, following\nHusserl, \u201ctypes\u201d. Types can vary within the limits defined\nby the species. A single person can exemplify many types,\ne.g., by age, social status, etc. Stein maintains that each\nentity\u2014from a plant to an animal or human being\u2014has an\ninner \u201cform\u201d (Gestalt) that determines it to\nbecome the thing it is\u2014just as individual seeds become beech\ntrees or fir trees (2000c: 32[130]).\n\nThe subject is the \u201cbearer of spiritual life\u201d (1931:\n87[124]). Intentionality is the being of subjective spirit\n(1931 85[121]), i.e., it constitutes subjective spirit as such. There\nare two sides to spiritual being: \u201cbeing illumined\u201d\n(durchleuchtet) and \u201cbeing open\u201d\n(ge\u00f6ffnet) (1931: 104[154]). Intelligibility\n(intelligibilitas) is \u201cbeing illumined\u201d (1931:\n84[123]). \u201cKnowledge is something proper to spiritual\nbeing\u201d (1931: 111[165]) but spirit cannot be just knowing; it\nmust also have freedom of will (Stein 1950/2006: 341[402]). Stein\nclaims already in the Beitr\u00e4ge that spirit is openness\n(1922: 296[295\u2013296]; see also 1950/2006: 307\u2013308[360]):\nopenness for an objective world, which is experienced; and\nopenness for someone else\u2019s subjectivity, someone else\u2019s\nspirit. In Potency and Act, she maintains that \n\n\nbeing open for oneself and for what is other is the highest and hence\nalso the most proper form of spirit whereto all other spiritual being\nharks back. (1931: 175[255])\n\n\u201cBeing open\u201d means being able to engage what is other than\noneself, stand over against it, turn toward it intentionally. (1931:\n175[254]) \n\n\nStein\u2019s concepts of blooming, unfolding and openness are crucial\nfor understanding her \u201cessentialism\u201d in respect to gender\nor sex, as we shall discuss in\n Section 4.2\n below.\n",
