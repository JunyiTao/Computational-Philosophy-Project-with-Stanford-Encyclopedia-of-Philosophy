Doctrine on the Intellect\n\nIt has been mentioned that it is through the intellect that human\nbeings know intelligibles, attain the sciences and the arts, and\ndiscern and reflect on practical matters. In The Treatise on the\nIntellect, known in Latin as De intellectu,\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b provides a complete account of the different\nsenses of the term \u2018aql (\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2,\nintellect or reason) starting with (1) the use that most people have\ngiven to the term, then (2) the way in which Islamic theologians have\nused it and, (3) finally, the different senses it has in\nAristotle\u2019s works, concretely, in Posterior Analytics,\nNicomachean Ethics, On the Soul, and\nMetaphysics (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 3\u20134; OI: 68).\n\n\nMost people use the term \u2018aql to describe the capacity\nthat enables a person to discern which deeds are virtuous and which\nare not by means of deliberation. This first sense is very close to\nAristotle\u2019s conception of prudence. Similarly, Islamic\ntheologians use this term to refer to those actions that are accepted\nor repudiated in general or by the majority. More important for our\npurposes in this article are the different senses of the term in the\nAristotelian corpus. According to al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, in\nPosterior Analytics 2.19, \u2018aql is understood\nas a faculty of the soul by means of which certainty about necessary,\ntrue, and universal premises is attained. Premises of this kind are\nnot arrived at by means of syllogisms, but are present in the subject\nin a prior way, either by nature or without one being aware of how\nthese premises were acquired. Hence, this faculty is some part of the\nsoul by which humans have access to the first principles of the\ntheoretical sciences. I shall refer to this use of the term in detail\nin the final section of this article (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI:\n5\u20139; OI: 69\u201370).\n\nIn Nicomachean Ethics 6.6, Aristotle uses the term\n\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 to refer to a part of the soul, namely\nprudence (\u03c6\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 /\nta\u2018aqqul), the ability to apprehend through experience\nthe principles of practical matters. Certainly, just as Aristotle\nrefers to the first principles of the theoretical sciences, he\nholds\u2014and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b after him\u2014that there\nare also first principles of the practical\n sciences.[5]\n Another sense is found in On the Soul 3.4 where, according\nto al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Aristotle divides the intellect into (1)\npotential (also known as material or passive) (\u2018aql\nbi-l-quwah), (2) actual or intellect in actuality (\u2018aql\nbi\u2019l-fi\u2018l), (3) acquired intellect (\u2018aql\nal-mustaf\u0101\u1e0d), and (4) active or agent intellect\n(\u2018aql al-fa \u2018\u2018\u0101l)\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 9\u201311; LC: 215; OI: 70\u201371).\nNotice that these stages are not present in Aristotle\u2019s On\nthe Soul, but in Alexander\u2019s On the Intellect.\nThis is one of the aspects that show evidence that\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b draws extensively upon Alexander, as several\nscholars have noticed (Davidson 1992: 48\u201363 & 65\u201370;\nGeoffroy 2002: 191\u2013231; Vallat 2004: 33\u201342). Finally, in\nMetaphysics Lambda, according to\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s account, Aristotle refers to the\nFirst Principle of existing things as the First Intellect\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 35\u201336; OI: 78). \n\nGiven the purpose of this article, the account of the intellect as\nused in the psychological context of the On the Soul deserves\ndeeper consideration (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 12\u201335; LC:\n215\u2013221; OI: 71\u201378). This approach is exhaustively\nexamined both in The Treatise on the Intellect and in The\nVirtuous City. In the latter there is a complete account of the\nway in which the rational or intellectual faculty acts\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC: 196\u2013211). Once\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b has explained the role of the imaginative\nfaculty as that which provides the intellect with impressions attained\nthrough the senses, he next explains the process whereby they become\nintelligibles in act. Following Aristotle and the Aristotelian\ntradition, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b describes the intellect as being\nitself potential or, using Alexander\u2019s terminology, an innate\n\u201cnatural disposition\u201d\n(\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c4\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\n/ isti\u2018d\u0101d) (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b VC:\n198\u2013199; Geoffroy 2002: 204). This kind of intellect is\nfrequently called \u201cpotential\u201d, \u201cmaterial\u201d, or\n\u201cpassive\u201d, and is simply the rational faculty with which\nall human beings are endowed.\n\nIn The Treatise on the Intellect al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nrefers to the material intellect (\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2\n\u1f51\u03bb\u03b9\u03ba\u1f78\u03c2, a Greek term coined by\nAlexander) as a soul or part of the soul, or one of the faculties of\nthe soul, or something that is in potency to abstract the forms from\ntheir matter and turning these into forms for itself\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 12\u201316; LC: 215; OI:\n 71\u201372).[6]\n When these forms are abstracted, they become intelligibles or forms\nfor the material intellect. It can be rightly said that for\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b the material intellect is like the matter\nwhere the abstracted forms come to be, where the material intellect\nitself becomes the abstracted forms, just as the imprinted object\nleaves its mark on a piece of wax.\n\nBefore a form of the objects outside the soul has been abstracted, the\nmaterial intellect is just in potency to receive those forms or\npotential intelligibles; but when these latter come to be in the\nmaterial intellect, the material intellect becomes an actual\nintellect, and the potential intelligibles are actualized. Now, the\nexistence of actual intelligibles is different from their existence as\npotential intelligibles or forms in matter. When external to the soul\nand linked to matter, forms are affected by place, time, position,\nquantity, and the like. But when forms are actualized in the soul,\nmany of these qualities are removed and their existence thus becomes\ndifferent from their former existence as forms of bodies outside the\nsoul (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 16\u201317; LC: 216; OI: 72).\n\nSince the actual intellect becomes itself the actual intelligibles,\nthen they are one and the same thing: what is understood is not\ndifferent from the intellect itself, since the actual intelligible has\nbecome the form of the actual intellect. If other intelligibles come\nto be in the actual intellect, they will also be actualized. As a\nconsequence, the actual intellect will be able to understand on its\nown and not by means of forms in matter outside from itself. When this\nstage of intellection is attained, the actual intellect becomes the\nso-called \u201cacquired\u201d intellect (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nLI: 19\u201321; LC: 216\u2013217; OI: 72\u201373).\n\nWhereas forms linked to matter have to be abstracted in order to\nbecome actual intelligibles in the actual intellect, the process of\nabstraction is not required in the case of forms separate from matter,\nthat is, the separate entities that belong to the supralunar realm.\nThese separate forms are grasped by the intellect not as actual\nintellect but as the acquired intellect, and thus become forms for it.\nMoreover, the acquired intellect is a perfection of the human\nintellect because it has no need to perform the activity of\nabstraction in order to grasp forms existing separately from matter.\nIn other words, it is the acquired intellect that enables the grasping\nof separate forms through the assistance of the active intellect.\nEvidently, this view differs from Aristotle\u2019s original stance,\nsince al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, once again following Alexander, links\npsychology and cosmology, that is, the acquired intellect and the\nactive intellect. \n\nRegarding the active intellect, as mentioned in the first section,\nthis intellect is a separate form, which is not linked to matter, and\nhas never been and never will be. According to\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, in its species the active intellect is an\nactual intellect quite similar to the acquired intellect. The active\nintellect is what turns the material intellect into an actual\nintellect and what turns the potential intelligibles into actual\nintelligibles. To describe the assistance of the active intellect in\nthis process, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b resorts to the well-known\nanalogy of light, used by Aristotle in On the Soul 3, which\nraised a great deal of discussion among late ancient and medieval\ncommentators of Aristotle.\n\nThe way al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b builds the referred analogy echoes\nAlexander and Themistius (Davidson 1992: 50). Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\ndescribes the relationship of the active intellect and the material\nintellect as that held between the sun and sight\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 24\u201327; LC: 218\u2013219; OI:\n74\u201375). As H. A. Davidson (1992: 50\u201351) states, the\nanalogy is built upon Aristotle\u2019s theory of vision, but\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b stresses the sun as the source of the\n light.[7]\n Therefore, al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b equates the sun as the source of\nlight with the active intellect, and not with the light itself. In\nthis sense, following Davidson\u2019s description, the light from the\nsun does four things: (1) it enters the eye and turns its potential\nvision into actual vision; (2) it enables potentially visible colors\nto become visible in actuality; (3) it itself becomes visible to the\neye; and (4) it renders the sun, its source, visible to the eye. The\nanalogy works as follows: (1) the active intellect turns the material\nor passive intellect into intellect in actuality; (2) it transforms\npotential intelligibles (sense impressions stored in the imaginative\nfaculty) into actual intelligibles; (3) it itself becomes an\nintelligible object for the human intellect; and (4) it renders the\nactive intellect as an intelligible object for the human intellect.\nWith this analogy al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b suggests that the active\nintellect provides some sort of illumination or flow of light by which\nthe human intellect is actualized enabling it to grasp the forms by\nabstraction.\n\nThrough the intellective process described, the active intellect makes\nthe forms that are in matter progressively more immaterial and brings\nabout the acquired intellect. Since the acquired intellect is of the\nsame sort as the active intellect, the human intellect thus becomes\nprogressively closer to the active intellect. In the view of\nal-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, this is precisely the ultimate goal and\nhappiness (sa\u2018\u0101dah) of human beings, and\nconstitutes the way in which they attain definitive perfection:\nthrough the intellectual process the acquired intellect gradually\nbecomes a substance that performs the action by virtue of which it\nrealizes itself fully as substance and, in this way, remains in\nexistence in the afterlife (hay\u0101h al-\u0101kh\u012brah)\n(al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b LI: 27; 31\u201332; LC: 219\u2013220; OI:\n75\u201376). Through this gradual process of perfection, the acquired\nintellect ends up acting only within itself, equating its own action\nwith its own existence. When this stage is reached, the body is no\nlonger needed as its matter in order to subsist, whereas it was\ninitially needed for actions such as sensation and imagination to take\nplace. Hence, the most perfect state the intellect can achieve is when\nit can subsist independently from the body. Nevertheless, the way in\nwhich al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b understood the relation between the\nacquired and agent intellects, was harshly criticized by Averroes who\njudged it impossible to conceive the transformation of the material\nintellect within the perishable human being into an immaterial and\neternal substance at the level of the agent intellect (Averroes LCD:\n387\u2013388). \n",
