These teachings arguably\nassume the Son to be a self, not a mere mode of a self, and to be a\ndifferent self than his Father. Theories such as Ward\u2019s (section\n 1.3\n above), which make the Son a mere mode, make him something less than\na self, whereas others (see section\n 1.6)\n make him a self, but the same self as his Father. Either way, the Son\nseems not to be qualified either to mediate between God and humankind,\nor to be a friend of the one he calls \u201cFather\u201d.\n\nAgain, some traditional incarnation theories seems to assume that the\neternal Son who becomes incarnate (who enters into a hypostatic union\nwith a complete human nature) is the same self as the historical man\nJesus of Nazareth. But no mere mode could be the same self as\nanything, and the New Testament seems to teach that this man was sent\nby another self, God.\n\nSome one\u2013self theories run into trouble about God\u2019s\nrelation to the cosmos. If God exists necessarily and is essentially\nthe creator and the redeemer of created beings in need of salvation,\nthis implies it is not possible for there to be no creation, or for\nthere to be no fallen creatures; God could not have avoided creating\nbeings in need of redemption. One-self trinitarians may get around\nthis by more carefully specifying the properties in question: not\ncreator but creator of anything else there might be,\nand not redeemer but redeemer of any creatures in need of\nsalvation there might be and which he should want to save.\n",
