Metaphysics II \u2014 Agency and the Free Will Problem\n\nWe like to think that we are sometimes morally responsible for some of\nthe things we have done. It seems natural to suppose that if a person\nis morally responsible for something he has done, then he could have\ndone otherwise. But there is a puzzle here. Precisely what do we mean\nwhen we say of a person who acted in a certain way that \u201che\ncould have done otherwise\u201d? Chisholm takes this as a fundamental\nquestion in the metaphysics of action. It seems to be his way of\nconceiving of the so-called \u201cfree will problem\u201d. He\ndiscussed this topic in \u201cFreedom and Action\u201d (1966),\n\u201cHe Could Have Done Otherwise\u201d (1967a) and then again in\n[P&O] as well as in quite a few other papers. It would be very\ndifficult to describe in detail all the twists and turns of\nChisholm\u2019s constantly evolving views on this topic. Instead, we\nwill focus on some of the more persistent and characteristically\nChisholmian points.\n\nSuppose a certain person in fact did not go to Boston this morning,\nbut suppose it seems that he could have done so. We want to say that\nthough he stayed in Providence, he could have done otherwise \u2014\nhe could have gone to Boston. Surely the statement that he could have\ndone otherwise does not mean merely that it is logically possible that\nhe did otherwise, for superhuman and miraculous bits of behavior are\nlogically possible. But we don\u2019t want to say, of a person who\nfailed to perform a miracle, that he could have done otherwise. Nor\ndoes our statement mean that it is epistemically possible that the\nperson did otherwise. Suppose that this man was confined in\nProvidence, and utterly incapable of getting to Boston on a certain\nmorning. Suppose we know nothing about this confinement. We just know\nthat he remained in Providence. Under these circumstances, while it is\nepistemically possible for us that he went to Boston, it would not be\ncorrect to say that he could have done so. His doing otherwise than\nstaying in Providence was epistemically possible for us, but not\npossible for him in the way that bears on moral responsibility.\n\nSome have said that \u2018can\u2019s are constitutionally iffy. On a\nsimple version of this view, to say that someone could have done\notherwise is just to say that if he had chosen to do otherwise, then\nhe would have done otherwise. Chisholm points out ([P&O],\n56\u20137) two reasons why this is wrong. First, suppose the person\nwas capable of traveling in any direction and easily could have gone\nto Boston; but suppose in addition that he did not know the way to\nBoston. If he had chosen to go to Boston, he would have ended up in\nNew London. Then it is correct to say that he could have gone to\nBoston, but incorrect to say that if he had chosen to go to Boston, he\nwould have done so. Secondly, suppose the person is incapable of\nchoosing to go to Boston. Maybe he is overwhelmed with fear of Boston.\nBut if nothing else prevents the trip, it will be correct to say that\nif he had chosen to go to Boston, he would have gone, but it is\nincorrect to say that he could have gone to Boston.\n\nAnother account of \u2018could have done otherwise\u2019 makes use\nof the concept of sufficient antecedent causal condition. We\nmight think that when we say that someone could have gone to Boston\ninstead of staying in Providence, what we mean is merely that at some\nearlier time this morning, his trip to Boston was causally\nindeterminate \u2014 there was no sufficient causal condition either\nfor his going to Boston or for his not going to Boston. Chisholm\nargues against this idea, too. Suppose another person was lying in\nwait in Chelmsford. Suppose this other person would have freely\ninterfered with our man\u2019s travel plans if he had tried to get to\nBoston. Then it would not be correct to say that the man could have\ngone to Boston, but it would have been correct to say that there was\nno sufficient causal condition then in place that would have prevented\nthe trip. The relevant sufficient causal condition would not have\narisen until the person lying in wait in Chelmsford had freely\ninterfered.\n\nThus we have a problem. What do we mean when we say that a person\ncould have done otherwise? Chisholm begins by introducing some\nconcepts that will serve as conceptual primitives in his account. The\nfirst of these is a concept that Chisholm calls \u201ccausal\ncontribution\u201d. If one event helps to bring about another, then\nwe have one familiar sort of causal contribution. But in other cases\nit is not an event, but a person, who causally contributes to some\nevent (1966, 284). A case (if there are any) in which a person\ncausally contributes to some event would be described as an instance\nof \u201cagent causation\u201d. Chisholm claims that in an earlier\nera philosophers would have thought that agent causation is the\nfamiliar notion; they would have assumed that event causation is to be\nexplained in terms of it. He recognized that at the time of his\nwriting the priority relation between the concepts had probably\nreversed.\n\nThe second concept that Chisholm employs is the concept of\nundertaking or endeavoring. This is an irreducibly\nteleological concept. It introduces the notion of purpose, or aim.\nChisholm makes use of this undefined expression: \u2018S\nmakes B happen in the endeavor to make A\nhappen\u2019. Suppose, for example, that a man dials a certain\ntelephone number intending thereby to make a certain phone ring in Los\nAngeles. (Recall that Chisholm started working on this material back\nin the 1960s. Telephones had dials in those days.) Let Smith be the\nman; let B be the state of affairs that consists in\nSmith\u2019s dialing the phone; let A be the state of\naffairs that consists in the phone\u2019s ringing in Los Angeles.\nThen it would be correct to say, using Chisholm\u2019s undefined\ntechnical term, that Smith made B happen in the endeavor to\nmake A happen.\n\nFrom the fact that Smith thus endeavored to make the phone ring, it\ndoes not follow that phone actually rang. Maybe it was off the hook.\nThus endeavor has a certain intentional aspect. Furthermore, assume\nthat the telephone in Los Angeles is in fact the only purple phone in\nthe Area Code. Even if Smith dialed in the endeavor to make that phone\nring, it does not follow that he dialed in the endeavor to make the\nonly purple phone in the Area Code ring. Maybe Smith didn\u2019t know\nthe color of the phone; maybe he didn\u2019t care about making purple\nphones ring. So the concept of endeavor has a further intentional\nfeature.\n\nChisholm then introduces an element of indeterminism: suppose that at\na certain time there is no sufficient causal condition for a person to\nendeavor to bring about p; suppose in addition that there is\nthen is no sufficient causal condition for him to fail to endeavor to\nbring about p. Then Chisholm wants to say that he is free to\nendeavor to make p happen.\n\nIn some such cases a person might be free to endeavor to bring about a\ncertain state of affairs, and furthermore if he were to endeavor to\nbring it about, he would succeed. Such things are directly in a\nperson\u2019s power. Chisholm notes that he is thus making the\nconcept of power \u201cconstitutionally iffy\u201d.\n\nIn other cases a person might not have a certain state of affairs\ndirectly in his power, but there might be a sequence of things,\n<p, q, r, s> such that he\nhas p directly in his power, and if he were to bring about\np, he would then have q directly in his power, and\nif \u2026 he would have s directly in his power. In such a\ncase, the person has s indirectly in his power.\n\nWith these concepts in place, Chisholm is prepared to answer the\nquestion with which he started. Suppose again that a certain person\ndid not travel to Boston this morning. To say that he could have done\notherwise \u2014 that he could have traveled to Boston this morning\n\u2014 is just to say that as of this morning, going to Boston was\neither directly or indirectly in his power. Chisholm claims \u2014\nwith some plausibility \u2014 that this account of the meaning of\n\u2018he could have done otherwise\u2019 explicates what those who\nbelieve in freedom have in mind when they say that someone could have\ndone otherwise. Furthermore, in virtue of various technicalities of\nthe definitions, it apparently turns out that Chisholm\u2019s account\nof the meaning of \u2018he could have done otherwise\u2019 is\nadequate to all the cases that prove difficult for theories such as\nthe ones surveyed above.\n\nOne essential element of Chisholm\u2019s view is the idea that there\nis a distinction between event causation and agent causation. In cases\nexclusively involving event causation, everything that causally\ncontributes to an event is another event. In cases involving agent\ncausation, among the things that causally contribute to an event is a\nperson. In virtue of this feature, Chisholm\u2019s view is generally\ncategorized as a form of libertarianism. Another essential element of\nhis view is the idea that when a person acts freely, he does something\nfor which there is no event or state or combination of events or\nstates that is a sufficient causal condition for his doing it. (There\nis also no event or state that is a sufficient causal condition for\nhis failing to do it, obviously.) In virtue of this feature of his\nview, it may be seen as incorporating an element of indeterminism.\n",
