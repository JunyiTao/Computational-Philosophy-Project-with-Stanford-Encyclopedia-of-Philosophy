    "main_text": "Methodology\n4. Methodology\n\nResearch in quantum gravity has always had a rather peculiar flavor,\nowing to both the technical and conceptual difficulty of the field and\nthe remoteness from experiment. Yoichiro Nambu (1985) wryly labels\nresearch on quantum gravity \u201cpostmodern physics\u201d on\naccount of its experimental remoteness. Thus conventional notions of\nthe close relationship between theory and experiment have but a\ntenuous foothold, at best, in quantum gravity. However, since there\nis a rudimentary \u2018pecking order\u2019 amongst the\nvarious approaches to quantum gravity, and since the history of\nquantum gravity contains various fatalities, there clearly are\nsome methods of theory evaluation in operation, there are\nconstraints functioning in something like the way experiment and\nobservation function. Investigating these methods and constraints\nconstitutes an open research problem for philosophers of\nscience\u2014for initial investigations along these lines, see James\nMattingly (2005a and 2009) and Rickles (2011). Audretsch (1981) argues\nthat quantum gravity research conflicts with Kuhn\u2019s account of\nscientific development since it stems from the desire to unify (for\nreasons not based on any empirical tension) multiple paradigms, both\nof which are well-confirmed and both of which make claims to\nuniversality. One might easily question Audretsch\u2019s focus on\ndirect empirical tensions here. Given, as he admits, both general\nrelativity and quantum theory claim to be universal theories,\nany conceptual or formal tension that can be found to hold between\nthem must point to either or both theories being in error in their\nclaims to universality\u2014this is an empirical claim of sorts. In\nthe context of string theory, Peter Galison (1995) argues that\nmathematical constraints take the place of standard empirical\nconstraints. James Cushing (1990) also considers some of the potential\nmethodological implications of string theory (though he deals with\nstring theory in its earliest days, when it underwent a transition\nfrom the dual resonance model of hadrons into a theory of quantum\ngravity). Dawid (2014) focuses in more detail on methodological issues\nin string theory and defends the idea that string theory is\ncharacterised by a uniqueness claim (the no-alternatives argument)\naccording to which string theory is the only way to unify\ngravity and the other fundamental interactions, thus grounding\nphysicists\u2019 strong belief in the theory; however, that is a\nrather different problem (that of constructing a theory of everything)\nthan the more restricted problem of quantum gravity \u2014 quantum\ngravity researchers from other approaches might simply reject the need\nfor such a unified theory (e.g., as opposed to a theory that is\ncompatible with the inclusion of other interactions). \n",
