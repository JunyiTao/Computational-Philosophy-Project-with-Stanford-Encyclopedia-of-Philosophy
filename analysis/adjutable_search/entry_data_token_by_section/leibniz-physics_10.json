    "main_text": "Leibniz on the Laws of Motion || Refuting Cartesian Laws of Motion\n4.1 Refuting Cartesian Laws of Motion\n\n\nIn addition to maintaining that the quantity of motion in the world \nis conserved, Descartes held that material bodies are governed by \nthree laws of motion and seven rules of impact (AT VIIIA 62\u201371/CSM \n 1:240\u2013245).[22]\n The first two laws in the Principles concern the movements \nof bodies in isolation, and taken together constitute Descartes\u2019s \nformulation of the principle of inertia. The third law in the \nPrinciples regulates the behavior of bodies colliding under \nidealized conditions: \n\n\nWhen a moving body comes upon another, if it has less force for \nproceeding in a straight line than the other has to resist it, then \nit is deflected in another direction, and retaining its motion, \nchanges only its determination. But if it has more, then it moves the\nother body with it, and gives the other as much of its motion as it \nitself loses. (AT VIIA.65/CSM 1:242)\n\n\nSignificantly, the third law thus distinguishes between two kinds of \ncases that Descartes believes to be importantly different. The first \nkind of case occurs when a moving body with a given power for \nproceeding collides with another body that has a greater power for \nresisting. Descartes maintains that in such situations the moving \nbody\u2019s direction or determination is altered, but that nonetheless \nthe quantity of motion for each of the colliding bodies remains the \nsame. The second kind of case occurs when a moving body with a given \npower for proceeding collides with another body that has a lesser \npower for resisting. Descartes maintains that in such situations, the\nmoving body\u2019s determination remains the same, and that the moving \nbody carries the resisting body along with it in such a way that \ntheir shared total quantity of motion remains the same. The seven \nrules further spell out the implications Descartes takes his laws of \nmotion to have for more specific cases of impact. \n\n\nAlthough Descartes\u2019s laws of motion go beyond his conservation law in\nplacing further constraints on the directions of bodies, they \nnonetheless presuppose that the total quantity of motion of bodies \nremains the same. Leibniz is therefore able to argue that Descartes\u2019s\nlaws of motion are untenable because they would lead to violations of\nthe conservation of force as measured by mv2. \nThus, in a letter to Bayle of 1687, Leibniz introduces, as an \nexample, a case where a ball B moving with 100 degrees of \nspeed collides head on with a ball C moving with 1 degree of\nspeed. Before the collision the two balls collectively have 101 units\nof quantity of motion as measure by ms, and 10,001 units of \nvis viva as measured by mv2. \nAccording to Descartes\u2019s Third Rule, after the collision the two \nballs should move together in the direction of B with a \nspeed of 50 \u00bd units. Their quantity of motion will be 101 \nunits as dictated by Descartes\u2019s conservation law, but their quantity\nof vis viva will be 2(50 \u00bd)2 or \n5100 \u00bd units. Leibniz thus objects that Descartes\u2019s laws of \nmotion would violate the conservation of vis viva \nand with it the principle that the whole cause must be equal to the \nentire effect (G III.46).\n\n\nIn addition to attacking Descartes\u2019s laws of motion on the basis of \nthe principle of the equality of cause and effect, Leibniz also \nmaintains that they would violate another \u201cmetaphysical\u201d \nprinciple, namely, the principle of continuity according to \nwhich continuous changes in inputs should lead to continuous changes \nin \n outputs.[23]\n Thus, for example, in a letter to Malebranche of July 1687, Leibniz \nwrites:\n\n\nI shall not repeat here what I have said before about the other \nsource of [Descartes\u2019s] errors, in taking the quantity of motion for \nthe force. But his first and second rules, for example, do not agree \nwith each other. The second says that if two bodies B and \nC collide in a straight line and with equal velocities, but \nB is but the least amount greater than C, \nC will be reflected with its former velocity, but B\nwill continue its motion. But according to his first rule, if \nB and C are equal and collide in a straight line, \nboth will be reflected and return at a velocity equal to that of \ntheir approach. This difference in the outcome in these two cases is \nunreasonable, however, for the inequality of the two bodies can be \nmade as small as you wish, and the difference between the assumptions\nin the two cases, that is, the difference between such inequality and\na perfect equality, becomes less than any difference; therefore \naccording to our principle, the difference between the effects or \nconsequences ought also to become less than any given difference. (G \nIII.53/L 352)\n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s argument here is that as the sizes of the bodies B\nand C change continuously from inequality to equality the \neffects of that change should be continuous as well. Descartes\u2019s \nrules of impact, however, would have an infinitesimal change in input\n\u2013 a change from B\u2019s being infinitesimally bigger than \nC, to C\u2019s being equal in size to B \u2013\nresult in a leap of output \u2013 from C rebounding while \nB remains stationary, to both B and C \nrebounding. Leibniz maintains that Descartes\u2019s rules of impact must \ntherefore be false since they violate the principle of continuity. \n\n\nIt is worth noting that, for Leibniz, the significance of the \nprinciple of continuity runs deeper than providing yet another reason\nfor thinking that the Cartesian laws of motion are \n flawed.[24]\n For him the principle of continuity is a contingent principle of \norder grounded not in brute necessity, but in divine benevolence \n\u2013 a discontinuous world would not be impossible, but merely \nsub-optimal. As such, Leibniz takes it to yield further support for \nthe metaphysical and methodological points noted above in connection \nwith his \u201cproof\u201d of the conservation of vis \nviva. Metaphysically, Leibniz takes the principle of continuity \nto support the claim that the true laws of motion are contingent \nsince they follow not from God\u2019s immutable nature or eternal truths, \nbut rather from God\u2019s wisdom and benevolence. Methodologically, he \ntakes it to support once again his view that the most promising route\nto the discovery of nature\u2019s secrets is neither blind empiricism, nor\ndeductive rationalism, but a combination of observation, pure reason,\nand reflection on the constraints imposed by considerations of the \nbest.\n",
