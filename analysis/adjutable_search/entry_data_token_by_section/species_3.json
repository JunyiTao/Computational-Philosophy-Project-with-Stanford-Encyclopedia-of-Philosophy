    "main_text": "The Ontological Status of Species || Species as Sets\n2.3 Species as Sets\n\nSome philosophers think that Hull and Ghiselin too quickly dismiss the\nassumption that species are natural kinds. Kitcher (1984) believes\nthat species are sets of organisms. Thinking of species as sets is an\nontologically neutral stance. It allows that some species are\nspatiotemporally restricted sets of organisms, that is, individuals.\nAnd it allows that other species are spatiotemporally unrestricted\nsets of organisms.\n\nWhy does Kitcher believe that some species are individuals and other\nspecies are spatiotemporally unrestricted sets? Following the\nbiologist Ernst Mayr, Kitcher suggests that there are two fundamental\ntypes of explanation in biology: those that cite proximate\ncauses and those that cite ultimate causes. Proximate\nexplanations cite the more immediate cause of a trait, for example,\nthe genes or developmental pathways that cause the occurrence of a\ntrait in an organism. Ultimate explanations cite the evolutionary\ncause of a trait in a species, for example, the selection forces that\ncaused the evolution of thumbs in pandas and their ancestors.\n\nFor each type of explanation, Kitcher believes that there are\ncorresponding definitions of the term \u2018species\u2019 (what\nbiologists call \u2018species concepts\u2019). Proximate\nexplanations cite species concepts based on structural similarities,\nsuch as genetic, chromosomal and developmental similarities. These\nspecies concepts assume that species are spatiotemporally unrestricted\nsets of organisms. Ultimate explanations cite species concepts that\nassign species evolutionary roles. These species concepts assume that\nspecies are lineages and thus individuals.\n\nKitcher is correct that biologists attempt to explain the traits of\norganisms in two ways: sometimes they cite the ultimate, or\nevolutionary, cause of a trait; other times they cite a structural\nfeature of an organism with that trait. A problem with Kitcher\u2019s\napproach is his characterization of biological practice. Biologists\nsince Darwin have taken species to be evolutionary units. A glance at\na biology text book will reveal that the evolutionary approach to\nspecies is the going concern in biology. The groups that correspond to\nKitcher\u2019s structural concepts are not considered species by\ntaxonomists. Groups of organisms that have genetic, developmental,\nbehavioral and ecological similarities, are natural kinds in biology,\nbut they are not considered species. Consider such groups of organisms\nas males, females, tree nesters and diploid organisms. These groups of\norganisms cut across species. For instance, some but not all humans\nare males and many organisms in other species are males. Male is a\nkind in biology, but it is not a species. Kitcher\u2019s motivation\nfor asserting that species are sets is to allow spatiotemporally\nunrestricted groups of organisms to form species. That motivation,\nhowever, is not substantiated by biological theory or practice.\n",
