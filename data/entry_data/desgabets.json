    "preamble": "\n\nDom Robert Desgabets (1610\u20131678) was an early defender and\nteacher of the Cartesian philosophy at St. Maur in the region of\nLorraine, France. He was born in Ancemont and in 1636 became a monk in\nthe Benedictine order. He taught theology at Saint-Evre at Toul\nbetween 1635\u20131655 and served as Procurer General of Mihiel to\nParis during 1648\u201349. Although he is little-known today, he\nplayed an important role in the development and transmission of the\nCartesian philosophy, especially in Paris and Toulouse. He is best\nknown for his part in the theological controversy over the Cartesian\nexplication of the Eucharist (Desgabets, 1671), and for his defense of\nNicolas Malebranche against the skeptic Simon Foucher (Desgabets,\n1675). His major philosophical writings were not published until\n 1983.[1]\n His contributions in natural philosophy include pioneering work in\nthe study of blood transfusion and mechanics. His unusual marriage of\nCartesianism and empiricism challenges many standard views of\nDescartes and the Cartesian philosophy.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Writings\n\nAlthough Robert Desgabets (1610\u20131678) is perhaps the most\noriginal of the Cartesian thinkers, even lauded by his most famous\nstudent, Pierre-Sylvain R\u00e9gis, as \u201cone of the greatest\nmetaphysicians of our century\u201d (Regis, 1704, 328), only one book\nand two small works were published anonymously during his\n lifetime.[2]\n His correspondence indicates that he was interested in mechanics\nbefore 1644, prior to his acquaintance with the writings of Descartes.\nFor a metaphysical thinker like Desgabets, it was Descartes, not\nGalileo or Bacon, who offered a new and complete philosophic system.\nIn Desgabets\u2019s estimation, the only legitimate rival system to\nDescartes\u2019s was the one developed by Pierre Gassendi, but in the\nfinal analysis, the \u201cnew scientific discoveries\u201d weighed\ndecisively in Descartes\u2019s favor.\n\nIn 1658 Desgabets participated in the Cartesian conferences held at M.\nde Montmort\u2019s where he reportedly participated in discussions\nwith Rohault, Clerselier, and Cordemoy. Desgabets delivered a lecture\nwhich outlined his invention of an apparatus and procedure for blood\ntransfusion, but he seems to have abandoned its study shortly\nthereafter. In 1667, after a controversy erupted between the English\nand the French over who first invented the procedure, a French\nphysician by the name of Jean Denis was spurred to publish the written\nversion of Desgabets\u2019s lecture. This appeared in 1668, four\nyears after the physicians Clark and Henshaw of England had attempted\nthe operation on animals without success (Desgabets, 1668). Prior to\nthis research, in 1656, Christopher Wren successfully injected\nmedications directly into the veins of animals, after which in 1665,\nanother Englishman and physician, Richard Lower, a teacher and friend\nof John Locke, successfully injected blood into animals using this\nsame method. Genevieve Rodis-Lewis has sorted out many of the details\nof this history and shows that the two procedures created by Lower and\nDesgabets are so different as to confirm the independence of their\ninventions (Rodis-Lewis, 1974). But whether and when Desgabets\nexperimented with his procedure has not been firmly established. What\nis evident, however, is that Desgabets, like Wren, was inspired by\nHarvey\u2019s discovery of the circulation of blood. Once Harvey had\nshown how the circulation of blood is best understood as a mechanistic\nprocess operating according to lawful movements, he opened the way for\nblood transfusion to be understood along similar lines, as a species\nof the communication of movement. Where evidence of Desgabets\u2019s\nactual experimentation with blood transfusion is lacking, his\ndescriptions of it show that he was aware of the possibility of shock\nif the quantities transferred were too great for the subject\n(Rodis-Lewis, 1974).\n\nThroughout his lifetime Desgabets engaged in many theological and\nphilosophical controversies with distinguished seventeenth-century\nthinkers such as Mabillon, Rapin, Foucher, Malebranche, Cordemoy,\nArnauld and Poisson. One of his more famous interlocutors was the\nCartesian G\u00e9rauld de Cordemoy (1626\u20131684). Despite his\nadmiration for Cordemoy, Desgabets was dismayed by the atomism in the\nDiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me (1666), a copy\nof which had been sent to him by Clerselier. Desgabets subsequently\nwrote to Clerselier, opposing Cordemoy\u2019s arguments for the\nexistence of the void and against the infinite divisibility of\nextension. In an unpublished letter to Clerselier, Desgabets comments\nthat the marriage of Cartesian and anti-Cartesian elements in this\nwork formed an irreconcilable schism in the Cartesian philosophy.\n(Prost, 1907, 158) Although Desgabets himself was not one to adopt\nCartesianism in its entirety, in his view his criticisms perfected and\nmaintained the integrity of the Cartesian principles, while\nCordemoy\u2019s adoption of atoms and the void was a direct affront\nto the Cartesian\n metaphysics.[3]\n\nAnother, much more scandalous exchange took place between Desgabets\nand Thomas Le G\u00e9ant between 1671\u20131672 over\nDesgabets\u2019s thoughts on the Eucharist. Desgabets published his\nviews anonymously in Consid\u00e9rations sur l\u2019\u00e9tat\npr\u00e9sent de la controverse touchant le T. S. Sacrement de\nl\u2019autel (1671). Lemaire credited this work with having been\nthe primary cause of the persecution of Cartesianism in France, since\nit brought to light the incompatibility of the Cartesian philosophy\nwith the official Church doctrine on the mystery of the Eucharist\n(Lemaire, 1901, 124). Desgabets had entered the on-going debate\nregarding Christ\u2019s real presence in the host in 1654 at\nClerselier\u2019s request. Desgabets set out to defend the Cartesian\ndoctrine of material substance against the Peripatetic doctrine of\nsubstantial forms in his explication of real presence and\ntransubstantiation. Clerselier and Rohault had defended\nDescartes\u2019s ideas on the subject along similar lines, but no one\nhad been willing, either privately or publicly, to argue as Desgabets\neventually did, that the body of Christ is extended in the host. In\naddition, Desgabets\u2019s persistence and perhaps even imprudence,\npushed the issue into the open. For, it was shortly after the\npublication of the anonymous Consid\u00e9rations that\nDesgabets sent additional writings on the topic to Abbey Le Roi, who\ncommunicated them to Nicole and Arnauld. The latter found\nDesgabets\u2019s views dangerous and completely against tradition. It\nwas through his acquaintance with Nicole and Arnauld, that the\nnon-Cartesian Le G\u00e9ant learned of the document and the identity\nof its author. Le G\u00e9ant alerted the Procurer General of the\nCongregation of Benedictines, who ordered Desgabets to report to his\nsuperiors concerning the matter. This led to an interrogation and the\nsubsequent issuance of an order on the 15th of December 1672, which\ndemanded that Desgabets renounce his views on the Eucharist\n(Armogathe, 1977, 104\u2013105; Lemaire, 1901, 51; 127\u2013128).\nDesgabets obeyed and retreated to a monastery at Breuil. Fortunately\nthis did not end his philosophical productivity. The controversy\nattracted the attention of Cardinal de Retz, who was known for his\nradical spirit of reform among conservative ecclesiastics in France.\nCardinal de Retz, who was a partisan of the new Cartesian philosophy,\nprovided protection for Desgabets and invited him to the Cartesian\nconferences held at Chateau de Commercy. It was here that Desgabets\ncriticized and corrected what he saw as the errors of Descartes, and\ncompleted his \u201cindefectibility thesis,\u201d which he had\nstarted in 1653\u20131654.\n\nDesgabets\u2019s last published work, Critique de la critique de\nla Recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 (1675), was intended as a\ndefense of Malebranche against the skeptic Simon Foucher. The\ncontroversy began with the publication of Malebranche\u2019s\nRecherche de la Verit\u00e9 (1674), followed by\nFoucher\u2019s critique, Critique de La Recherche de la\nVerit\u00e9 (1675), and Desgabets\u2019s rejoinder,\nCritique de la Critique de La Recherche de la Verit\u00e9\n(1675). Foucher presses Malebranche on a number of issues he\nsees as errors of dogmatism, centering on how ideas can be said to\nrepresent external objects to us. Foucher argues that ideas fail to\nrepresent if ideas share no likeness or similitude to their objects.\nDesgabets replies that ideas have an intentional or representational\nresemblance not a strict resemblance in the sense in which a painting\npictures its subject. Desgabets\u2019s response on behalf of\nMalebranche did not settle the controversy, nor was it appreciated by\nMalebranche himself. Malebranche wrote that although he was pleased\nwith the person, he was not pleased with the contents of his book; he\nfurther lamented that Desgabets ought to have better understood his\nideas before taking on a defense. Desgabets himself was never to see\nMalebranche\u2019s scolding assessment which was published in the\n\u201cAdvertissement\u201d of the third edition of the Search\nAfter Truth (Malebranche, 1958\u201384, v2, 500\u2013503).\nDesgabets died at Breuil on March 13, 1678, just fourteen days before\nit appeared.\n\nDesgabets\u2019s most important philosophical text,\nSuppl\u00e9ment \u00e0 la philosophie de M. Descartes\n(1675), was intended as a supplement to Descartes\u2019s\nMeditationes de prima philosophia (1641). In this\nwork, Desgabets examines many of Descartes\u2019s important doctrines\nand arguments. Desgabets defends the Cartesian doctrines of sensible\nqualities, matter as extended substance and mind as thinking\nsubstance, mind-body dualism, mind-body union and interaction in man,\nwhile criticizing Descartes\u2019s argument for the cogito\nas the first principle of knowledge, as well as Descartes\u2019s\narguments for pure intellection, innate ideas, and ideas having\nobjective reality (pure possibility). What is particularly interesting\nis the central importance that Desgabets gives to the role of\nsensation in knowledge, and his development of Descartes\u2019s\ntreatment of truth as both eternal and immutable but in some sense\n(one much contested in the literature) contingent. Desgabets more than\nonce remarks in this work that \u201cM. Descartes is not always a\ngood Cartesian,\u201d which typifies his conviction that Cartesianism\nis more than the sum of the particulars set down by Descartes\nhimself.\n\nViewing Desgabets\u2019s work as a whole, there is no doubt that what\nhe viewed as a revision or perfection of the Cartesian philosophy\nothers have viewed as a fundamental departure. In his favor, he never\nstrayed from the Cartesian metaphysics, i.e., its substance dualism of\nmind and matter, substance-mode ontology, mind-body union and\ninteraction, and the view that extension is the essence of matter and\nthought the essence of mind; and he remained loyal to the Cartesian\nphysics against the atomists. However, heretically to some, he\nstrongly rejected several key rationalist doctrines which often\ndominate in Descartes and argued that Descartes\u2019s own principles\nfavor a sensory foundation for knowledge.\n2. Metaphysics\n\nDesgabets has been variously described as an \u201corthodox\nCartesian\u201d for the fidelity with which he defended Descartes\nagainst his critics (Watson, 1966; 1987), and a \u201cradical\nCartesian\u201d for the originality of his ideas in the development\nof the Cartesian philosophy (Schmaltz, 2002; Adriaenssen, 2015). On\nthe side of orthodoxy, we can see Desgabets\u2019s adoption of the\nnew Cartesian philosophy in his adherence to the core Cartesian\nmetaphysics of dualism, mechanism, and union, and his various\ncritiques of Scholastic doctrines. On the side of radicalism,\nDesgabets took up arguments and ideas that would be difficult if not\nimpossible to reconcile with Descartes\u2019s published philosophy.\nThere is Desgabets\u2019s argument that the body is essential for all\noperations of the human mind making innate ideas impossible, his\ndefense of the intentionality principle, and his controversial\ndoctrine of indefectibility especially with respect to matter, and his\nunorthodox defense of the \u201cCreation Doctrine.\u201d Notably, as\nMalfara and Lennon have argued, there is Desgabets\u2019s development\nof the metaphysics of matter in the Eucharist controversy, which\nserves as a fascinating philosophical and theological litmus test for\nDesgabets\u2019s Radical Cartesianism (Malfara & Lennon,\n2023)\n\nDesgabets subscribed completely to the Cartesian doctrine of matter as\na substance extended in length, width, and breadth. It was posited\nagainst the prevailing Peripatetic view that posits prime matter and\nsubstantial forms in order to explain the permanence underlying the\ncontinuous change matter undergoes. On Descartes\u2019s view, the\nessence of matter is its extension in three dimensions, and all of its\nchanging attributes, properties and modes, such as movement, rest,\nfigure, situation and composition of parts, are completely dependent\nupon and follow from this unified extension (OPD 2, 27). Matter, or\ncorporeal substance, is clearly known when it is viewed as the\ngeometrical object of mathematicians, as a magnitude extended in\nlength, width and breadth. Likewise, corporeal bodies are best viewed\nas the movements, rest, figures, arrangements and sizes of which\ncorporeal substance is capable, and which, in its various\nconfigurations and assemblages, \u201c\u2026 now pass for the form\nof all particular bodies of which the world is composed\u201d (OPD 1,\n3). And, in all of this, \u201c\u2026 there is nothing which is not\ngoverned by the laws of mechanics\u201d (OPD 2, 4).\n\nFurthermore, Desgabets viewed bodies as portions or divisions of\nmatter, which in the case of animals are highly delicate and organized\nmachines composed of an infinite number of parts capable of an\ninfinite diversity of movements. He held this view against that of the\nPeripatetics who believed that there must be an internal principle of\nthought in beasts because of the intricacy and apparent human-like\nintelligence of their movements. According to Desgabets, the kind of\nthinking that attributes such an internal principle to beasts is the\nsame kind of thinking that results in the attribution of intelligence\nto clocks, \u201cHowever, the same affront to reason and philosophy\nis committed by the Americans and the Barbarians of the Orient who not\nbeing able to understand the mechanical reasons for the movement of\nclocks, or the true causes of natural effects, attribute souls and\nintelligence to machines, and likewise to fire, lakes etc., and in\ndoing so expose themselves to the mockery of Europeans\u201d (OPD 4,\n132\u2013133). In other words, no appeal to internal principles, or\nfinal causes is required to explain the movements of beasts, any more\nthan it is needed to explain the movements of clocks. The complexity\nof movements, whether involved in the operations of clocks or those of\nanimate bodies, is explicable in purely mechanistic terms.\n\nLikewise, all motions communicated within or between material bodies\nare effected by physical contact and proceed according to the laws of\nlocal motion. Desgabets was careful to emphasize that the ultimate\nsource of movement is not matter but God, who imparted motion to the\nuniverse in its creation. For Desgabets, it is this fact that grounds\nthe laws of nature: \u201cIt is the constant and uniform manner of\nthe action of God which founds these laws, by means of which He forms\nand maintains this beautiful harmony in the world which is one of the\ngreatest objects of our sciences\u201d (OPD 1, 13). As Desgabets saw\nit, the operation of these laws of nature and the rules of the\ncommunication of movement were the true and unique foundations of the\nnew physics.\n\nDesgabets also subscribed to the Cartesian conception of mind as an\nimmaterial substance whose essence is thought. The distinction between\nmind and matter is thus a real and substantial one, impossible not to\nperceive: \u201cNever has an infant asked for lies or truths for\nbreakfast, nor has he imagined that the stones encountered along his\npath were the gross thoughts of some countryman\u201d (OPD 5, 197).\nMinds, or immaterial substances, are of three kinds: uncreated, which\nis God; mind detached from body, which is an angel; and mind united to\norganized body, which is a reasonable soul. The second of these,\nangels, are the only pure minds in the created universe and they have\nno corporeal extension, no local presence or correspondence to\ntime\u2014they are simple and indivisible minds. Such minds or\nspirits cannot be perfected by any substantial union since their\nspecific spiritual being does not require anything corporeal to carry\nout its functions. However, they are capable of participating in the\nmovements of the visible world, though in doing so, they must undergo\na kind of degradation and punishment in order to receive pain. The\nthird of these spiritual beings is man, who consists of a cross\nbetween purely intellectual and purely corporeal things. In this\nDesgabets appears to have strayed slightly from the official Cartesian\ndoctrine of dual substances, since he claimed that outside of God\nthere are three sorts of simple created substances, matter or body,\nangel, and one which is composed of body and soul, which is man.\nHowever, this tripartite division of substances is supported by a more\nfundamental bipartite division of material and spiritual substances,\nso that strictly speaking, individual bodies and individual persons\nare best understood as modal beings not substances. This is\nnot unlike Descartes\u2019s account of man as a \u201ccomposite\nentity\u201d possessing two principal attributes, namely extension\nand thought, a being which itself is not a simple substance.\nNonetheless, in Desgabets as in Descartes, how to interpret the human\nsoul as a substance (Miller, 2008), or as a modal being (Lennon,\n1994), is a matter of continued debate.\n\nIt was an important point for Desgabets that man, unlike angels, is a\nbeing composed of body and soul, who continually experiences\nthe union of the two substances by the endless impressions he finds in\nhimself. The relation of mind and body in man is an essential one\nwhich must not be regarded as a penal state of the soul, but as the\naccomplishment of its natural perfection. Human thought has\nduration, succession, a beginning and an end\u2014qualities that\ndepend on the movements of the corporeal organs and which follow the\nrules of local movement. Although Descartes and Malebranche after him\nclaimed that the human mind is capable of detachment from the body,\nDesgabets rejected this, since the human mind is not like an\nangel\u2019s but requires continual commerce with the body and its\nsenses for all its operations.\n\nOne further issue concerning Descartes\u2019s general account of the\nnature of the mind-body union, which Desgabets raised in order to\ndispel, concerns the common complaint that the Cartesian view fails to\naccount for the interaction of material and immaterial substances.\nDesgabets did not regard this as a true problem because he thought\nthat the question demanded the impossible\u2014an explanation of how\nthe organized body and reasonable soul, which are in fact made for\neach other, can exercise a mutual commerce. He likened this\nto asking an artisan to explain how the convex surface of a peg\ncan possibly fill that of a concave hole. It is akin to\nasking why extension is the essence of body, or why thought is the\nessence of mind. It\u2019s just the way God made the world.\n\nWhat could be explained, according to Desgabets, is the way in which\nthe mind and body are in fact united and dependent upon one another.\nHe found an analogue in the nature of the body-body relation: two\nbodies are united when their superficies touch and their movements\ntake on a mutual dependence. Similarly, two minds are united when\ntheir thoughts and wills agree and depend on one another. The union of\nmind and body is not by touch, nor by agreement of thoughts, but by\nthe dependence that exists between certain thoughts and certain\nmovements such that one in fact follows from the other. The\nunion of the mind and body in man is so strict that it founds a\nspecies of communication for their commerce, in virtue of which our\nthoughts are said to have duration, succession, etc., without\nthemselves being corporeal. The union and its interaction cannot be\nfurther reduced in explanation. In short, the essence of man, who is\ncomposed of mind and body, is the union of mind and body, and\nthe only legitimate questions which concern this union relate to how,\ngiven the union, the mind determines the body and the body\ndetermines the mind, which is an empirical question, known through\nexperience not reason.\n\nDesgabets\u2019s thesis concerning the indefectibility of created\nsubstances, which underlies his metaphysics, is perhaps his most\noriginal if not radical philosophical contribution (Schmaltz, 2002;\nEaston, 2005; Gatto, 2017). Gatto argues that this thesis is the key\nto understanding Desgabets\u2019s peculiar development of\nDescartes\u2019s philosophy (Gatto, 2017). In a letter from Desgabets\nto Malebranche, we learn that he had begun the Treatise on the\nIndefectibility of Substances, as early as 1649 (Letter from\nDesgabets, Sept. 1674, Malebranche, 1958\u201384, vol. II: 85). It\nwas Desgabets\u2019s view that substances, in their essence and\nexistence, are eternal, indivisible, immutable, and indestructible,\nwhich is to say, indefectible. While the modes of substance can\nundergo change, the essence of substance and its existence cannot.\nAccording to Desgabets, the indestructibility, eternality, and\nindivisibility of substances follow from the fact that God created\nsubstances by a free and indifferent will. Once the world was created,\nit could not be uncreated. Thus, the key to understanding\nDesgabets\u2019s indefectibility thesis lies not only in his analysis\nof the Cartesian doctrine of substance, but in his interpretation of\nDescartes\u2019s notoriously opaque doctrine of the free creation of\nthe eternal truths, discussed in a later section, under\n\u201cTruth.\u201d\n\nAs we have seen, Desgabets\u2019s adoption of the new Cartesian\nphilosophy came with radical revisions that Descartes himself likely\nwould not have sanctioned. As Desgabets himself puts it in Preface to\nthe Supplement, Descartes made the true philosophy possible:\n\n\n\nI will again affirm that we need only look at the works of Descartes\nto speak thoroughly of these four great subjects I have just proposed.\nHe raised them all with the purpose of treating them and had views so\nextensive concerning them that we cannot fail to profit notably from\nhis work, if we take the trouble to examine his ideas. Nonetheless, I\nmust show in what follows that after delivering us from infinite\nerror, he himself was caught in imperceptible prejudices concerning\nfundamental things, which deprived the world of the greatest fruits of\nhis work. I will take the occasion of his own inventions to mark the\nplaces where he failed and to extend them as far as he should have. I\nwill uncover the contrarieties that are found among the things he\nadvanced and how sometimes he himself ceased to be a good Cartesian,\nby abandoning his finest discoveries to embrace popular opinions. I\nwill show that it is almost by his own doctrine that the errors are\ncorrected and that it is he who gives the remedy for the ill he\nproduced. I will establish his reputation upon eternal foundations by\ngiving his philosophy its expected reputation. For, it has to be known\nthat his philosophy, once purged of certain errors and having received\nthe vast scope possible to it, must pass for the masterpiece of the\nhuman spirit, and for what is the greatest of its kind in the world\n(OPD 5, 152).\n\n3. Epistemology\n\nThere is a long tradition of interpreting Desgabets as an empiricist\nfrom Victor Cousin (1852), and Francisque Bouillier (1868), to\nGenevieve Rodis-Lewis (1981, 1993), Patricia Easton and Thomas Lennon\n(1992), Tad Schmaltz (2002a; 2002b) and Sean Allen-Hermenson (2008).\nMonte Cook (2008) has raised an important challenge to the empiricist\nreading, questioning whether the senses provide any real content to\nour ideas. A discussion of some of the interpretive complexities\naround sensible qualities, the nature of ideas, the intentionality\nprinciple, and the method of truth follows below. Nonetheless, there\nis consensus that Desgabets rejected hyperbolic doubt, pure\nintellection and innate ideas, and insisted on the necessary role of\nthe senses in the formation of all ideas. Moreover, it is agreed that\nthese positions lean away from Descartes in varying degrees and\nconstitute a major if not radical revision of the Cartesian\nphilosophy.\n\nIn Desgabets\u2019s estimation, Descartes\u2019s truly great\ndiscovery was his identification of the true nature of sensible\nqualities (OPD 5, 164). The importance of this \u2018discovery\u2019\nin Desgabets\u2019s development of the Cartesian philosophy is\nparamount, since he believed that because of it, the way had been\nopened at last to lay the foundations of a true philosophy. Desgabets\ndrew out six important consequences (OPD 5, 165ff.), which he admits\nshows that \u201cDescartes is mistaken in what is the most\nfundamental in his method\u201d (OPD 5, 164). The six consequences\nare: (1) sensible qualities \u201c\u2026 are nothing else in\nobjects but the local dispositions of the small parts from which\nresult the sensations that we call heat, sound, light, etc.\u201d\n(OPD 2, 17); (2) sensible qualities are sentiments in the human soul\nthat have no resemblance to modes of matter, such as shape, size, and\nmotion; (3) external objects have the power to excite innumerable\nperceptions in us that we call sensations and ideas; (4) simple\nconceptions arise in us from objects outside us and are known truly,\nas they really exist; (5) knowing the true nature of sensible\nqualities as perceptions of the mind caused by bodies makes possible\nthe true physics; and, (6) by distinguishing the true nature of the\nbody from the sensible qualities it causes in us, we can unite physics\nwith the infallible sciences, for the solid of the geometer is the\nsame as the object of the physicist (extended matter). Each of these\nconsequences will be examined in more detail to investigate what was\nat the heart of Desgabets\u2019s adoption and revision of the\nCartesian philosophy.\n\n(1, 2, 3) Sensible qualities are states or modes of the human mind\nhaving only a causal relation to the specific local movements of our\nsensory organs, which in turn, are the effects of the local movements\nproduced by the corporeal qualities of matter. According to both\nDescartes and Desgabets, sensible qualities are nothing but\n\u201cvarious dispositions\u201d in objects to cause ideas in us.\nSince Descartes clearly held that sensible qualities are not the\nforms of material things but rather modes of the\nmind, the only sense in which sensible qualities could be\n\u201cin\u201d the various dispositions of objects is in the causal\nsense, that is, as their effects. While the status and nature of these\ndispositions in Descartes\u2019s account has been a subject of much\ndebate, he undeniably distinguishes between on the one hand, light,\ncolor, smell, taste, sound and touch (the so-called secondary\nqualities), and on the other hand, size, shape, and motion (the\nso-called primary qualities). Sensible qualities belong to the mind as\nmodes of perception, and primary qualities belong to body as modes of\nmatter. Desgabets follows suit by adopting the Cartesian distinction\nbetween minds and bodies, thereby attributing size, shape, and local\nmotions to body as modes of matter and sensible qualities such as\nheat, color, smells, sounds, pains and pleasures, and tangible\nqualities as modes of thinking things. Thus, sensible qualities\nqua modes of the mind have no resemblance or similarity to\nthe modes belonging to matter: \u201cthe sun is not luminous, the\nsnow is not white, the fire has no heat in the sense that we imagined\npreviously.\u201d (OPD 5, 165) However, Desgabets maintains that\nsensible qualities qua modes of mind do represent the soul\nand its relation to corporeal things, just as our ideas of\nbody and its modes when clearly perceived as shape, size, and local\nmotion, truly represent their object. How this is so brings us to the\nfourth consequence, that our simple conceptions arise in us from\nobjects outside us and are known as they actually exist.\n\n(4) Eclipsing the cogito as the first principle of knowledge\nin Desgabets\u2019s system is what has come to be known as the\n\u201cintentionality principle\u201d (Schmaltz, 2002; Hill, 2011;\nAdriaenssen, 2015). According to Desgabets by reflecting on the true\nnature of sensible qualities we are able to grasp the most general\nprinciple underlying all truths: that simple conception or the\nfirst operation of the mind is always true and conforms to its\nobject. As Desgabets describes this foundational principle:\n\u201c... that every idea has a real object; that nothing cannot be\nthought; that simple conception always conforms to its object; that to\nthink and to think of something are inseparable things, and as the\nnatural order would have it, we begin to philosophize by the\nexposition and development of this great principle ...\u201d (OPD5.\n178). If such a principle could be established, as Desgabets claims\nthat it can, it would mean that simple conception conforms to its\nobject, it preserves the truth, and hence provides the foundation for\nhuman knowledge. Most of Desgabets\u2019s discussion of the\nintentionality principle treats it as self-evidently true. If we\nreflect on the nature of human thought itself\u2014as by its nature\npresupposing an object\u2014then we see the absurdity of there being\na thought with no object. If we reflect on the existence of human\nknowledge itself then we see that it presupposes knowable\nthings\u2014for what is knowledge unless there are prior knowable\nthings? The intuition Desgabets seems to be working with is that\ngiven there is human thought and knowledge, there must\nbe objects of thought and objects known to make it possible. \n\nAlthough Desgabets gives a new meaning to the doctrine of simple\nconception, he and Descartes agree that simple conception is always\ntrue and conforms to its object, while error is a product of\nprecipitous judgment. This is a theme found in Descartes that depends\non the Cartesian distinction between the scope of the two basic\noperations of the mind\u2014that of the intellect and that of the\nwill. The functions of assenting and dissenting are performed by the\nwill, while those of perception and conception are performed by the\nsenses and intellect. Desgabets challenges Descartes\u2019s\n\u201cpretension\u201d that he could detach himself from all\ncommerce with the senses, which sets the rationalist tone of the\nMeditations. Of course, Descartes saw this detachment as\ndesirable because he thought it was in virtue of it that he could\navoid error and defend the certainty of human knowledge. Descartes\nalso argues that the soul is known more clearly than the body because\nwe, as thinking things, are intimately tied to the immaterial,\nthinking substance, which is our soul. The body, on the other hand, is\npart of material not immaterial substance, and so is not known\nimmediately. It is because of this that Descartes took the\ncogito to be the foundation of certainty in human knowledge,\nand our knowledge of body to be less clear and less immediate.\nHowever, according to Desgabets, this is where Descartes goes terribly\nastray. Had Descartes reflected more deeply on the nature of the\nmind-body union, he would have seen that our ideas of body and mind\nare equally clear, and equally evident. For, the soul of man is not an\nimmaterial substance, but is a result of the union of mind and body,\nand all our ideas, even of the soul, equally depend upon the operation\nof the senses. From here, it can be seen that there is a principle\nmore fundamental than the cogito, namely the principle of\nintentionality, that to think is to think of something.\nClarity and distinctness, according to Desgabets, tells us when we\nhave grasped something truthfully, but the intentionality of thought\ngrounds the truth of clarity and distinctness.\n\nBut how, according to Desgabets, are we to distinguish a simple\nconception from a precipitous judgment? In his\nSuppl\u00e9ment (OPD 6, 222) he offers the example of the\nheat of fire to illustrate the distinction: when someone approaches\nfire and has the sensation of heat he may be persuaded that the heat\nhe feels is in the fire just as he perceives it, since this sensation\nis known to him clearly. But, he has erred because of a tacit\njudgment. The judgment that the heat is in the fire entails that the\nheat as we perceive it resembles what is in the fire, which is false.\nFor, as Descartes discovered, the sensation of heat is a mode of the\nmind, not a mode of the fire (body). The fire we feel \u201c... is\nthe object of simple conception only when we do not conceive this heat\nas in the fire, rather as something that makes us have this feeling\nwhen we approach the fire. But if one says the heat of the fire\nresembles the sentiment that is our heat, a judgment is added to\nsimple perception and falls in error because the judgment extends\nbeyond the perception\u201d (OPD 6, 222). Likewise, when we judge\nthat a stick is straight or bent when half-submerged in water we judge\nprecipitously\u2014what is known is that it is equally real and\nconceivable that a stick (as a material body) is straight or curbed\n(is shaped) (Desgabets, 1675, 67\u201368). Thus, simple conception\ngrasps its object clearly and represents the thing perceived as it\nreally is. When we perceive the heat of the fire simpliciter,\nwe perceive the sensation of heat as a sensation of the mind; when we\nperceive the fire simpliciter, we perceive it as a corporeal\nbody having extension and local configurations and motions. Simple\nconceptions are the mind\u2019s grasp of things as they are in\nthemselves, which is to say, in relation to their essence and modes as\nextended substances, or as thinking minds: \u201cWe therefore have\nonly to think of extended substance which is matter, of its movements,\nof its figures, of the situations of its parts, of angels, of souls,\nof men and their operations, to be very sure that all this exists. For\nwhether thought represents to us substance or accident, body or\nspirit, it is equally necessary that all of these exist outside of\nthought, unless one thinks without thinking of anything, and the first\noperation of the mind ceases to conform to its object\u201d\n(Desgabets, 1675, 124). A related error made by Descartes, according\nto Desgabets, is to allow chimeras and other such beings of reason\namong the number of objects of simple conception. Such a mistake\nobscured Descartes from discovering the true foundation of human\ncertainty, the basic truth that the first operation of the mind has\nonly real things for its object. By including chimerical\nbeings among the objects of simple conception, Descartes opened the\ndoor to the possibility of thoughts without true objects. But,\njudgment or the extension of the will beyond the domain of what is\nconceived is the true source of chimerical beings of reason and hence\nof all error (OPD 4, 103).\n\n(5 & 6) Desgabets drew two more final consequences from\nDescartes\u2019s discovery of the true nature of sensible qualities.\nIn order to make physics a true science, Desgabets must accomplish two\nthings: first, show that the senses are necessary for the knowledge of\nphysical objects and; secondly, show that physics is founded in\ninfallible sciences (mathematics and geometry). The fifth consequence\nthus aims to establish that perceptions of the mind are caused by\nbodies and makes possible the true physics. In Part 1, chapter three\nof the Suppl\u00e9ment, Desgabets explicitly examines\nDescartes\u2019s rejection of the empiricist motto, that all\nknowledge comes from the senses. While Desgabets rejects the\nScholastic rendering of the motto, he is equally critical of\nDescartes\u2019s precipitous rejection of it. According to Desgabets,\nthe proper sense of the empiricist motto is that all thoughts\noriginate by the senses [a sensu] rather than in the\nsenses [in sensu], and what reaches the intellect is not what\nis found in the senses. As Lennon nicely puts it, \u201cFor him\nthings are directly perceived and an idea is the means by which, and\nnot in which, a thing is perceived\u201d (Lennon, 1998, 353). The\nsoul must always be in commerce with the senses by the nature of the\nmind-body union, and although our thoughts depend on the corporeal\ntraces in the brain for their source or origin, it does not follow\nthat our ideas must be corporeal, or even similar to corporeal things.\nThe very fact that all of our thoughts have a beginning, duration,\ncessation, and succession proves that they depend on motion, and\nmotion is only communicated through the senses. This is why he\nmodifies the empiricist motto from: nihil est in intellectu quin\nprius fuerit in sensu, to a sensu.\n\nWhile this formulation of the empiricist motto goes against the notion\nof pure intellection, it leaves open the question of whether the\nsenses play more than an occasional role in the occurrence of all\nthoughts, including about body. According to Desgabets, it is\nundeniable that man is a being who reasons, draws consequences, does\nnot see things indivisibly, who has thoughts in succession which\nbegin, continue, and finish, and who often experiences doubt and\nconjecture. Such doubting, discursive reasoning and succession of\nthought prove that all thought is tied to the body since duration and\nsuccessive extension are nothing but the local movements of the body\n(OPD 7, 299). A pure thought, the kind that Descartes (and Malebranche\nafter him) envisioned for metaphysical reasoning, would have no\nbeginning, duration, end, or succession. In short, such a thought\nwould be indivisible, and hence unthinkable by the human mind. Both\nDescartes and Malebranche rejected the empiricist thesis because they\nerroneously thought that it would commit them to the materialist\nthesis that thoughts and the soul are material. This led them to adopt\nthe intellectualist thesis regarding the mind\u2019s perception of\nmetaphysical essences. However, Desgabets saw a third option, one\nwhich is founded on the mind-body union and the sensory basis of all\nknowledge, and one which founds the full and proper sense of the\nempiricist motto, that all ideas originate by the senses. Since\nmovement is a mode belonging to body, many tended to conclude that if\nminds depend on movement, then minds must have something corporeal in\nthem. How could it be that our thoughts, which have something\ncorporeal in them, namely, movement, are not themselves corporeal? And\nyet, this is exactly what Desgabets argued. He believed that thoughts\nhave something corporeal in their being without themselves being\ncorporeal\u2014in the same way that every object in our thought has a\nbeginning, continuation, and end without these objects having duration\nin themselves. While things really have duration, it is only\nextrinsically and by thought, \u201cthe same way a pole is\ndivided into ten feet when one imagines the ten feet\u201d (OPD 7:\n299). \n\nAt first glance, Desgabets\u2019s analogy between attributing a\ncorporeal nature to thoughts and attributing a duration or division to\nthings serves more to confuse than clarify. But if we draw on his\naccount of the true nature of individual bodies, we can make some\nsense of it. Individual bodies are real in that they result from\nactual divisions of matter, assemblages of local dispositions of parts\nof matter. Bodies then act upon our sensory organs which in turn are\nreceived as ideas in the mind. But the individuation of\nperception into sensible ideas of bodies is essentially an\noperation performed by the mind, even though it has its foundation in\nthe local dispositions of matter itself. For example, our perception\nof a ten-foot pole is the effect of a specific assemblage of local\ndispositions of matter acting upon our sensory organs at a certain\ntime and the mind\u2019s division of that sensible body into\nten feet. The local disposition itself is not intrinsically a pole, or\nten feet long, but it is so extrinsically, that is, by thought.\nSimilarly, thoughts themselves are not intrinsically extended or\nsubject to movement, but they are so extrinsically, that is, as an\neffect of the operations of the sensory organs of the body. In other\nwords, just as the local movements of matter individuate thought\nextrinsically giving the mind individual thoughts, the thought of\nimmaterial substance individuates matter extrinsically thereby giving\nit perceptions of individual bodies. The mind-body union, and the\nessential intentionality which results from it, create the mutual\ndependence of the operations of mind and matter without requiring that\nmind be material or matter be immaterial.\n\nThis does not mean that the senses cannot access the true nature of\nthings. In fact, for Desgabets, since all knowledge comes from the\nsenses, the function of knowing the essences of things is a necessary\nrole served by the senses. Recall that the true nature of particular\nobjects consists in the local dispositions of parts of matter which\nproduce the course of the movements we experience. Think of these\nsensible objects as akin to Humean bundles of perceptions except that\nfor Desgabets there is a causal relation to the object of our idea\nthat ensures a conformity of the perceived object and the object.\nThese movements are the first and sole contact we have with the\nmaterial world, and so the senses present, in some form, not only the\nexistence of a given object, but also the value of that object in\nrelation to our survival. We only reach knowledge of the true nature\nof material objects by considering their being in relation to their\nsubstance. In order to achieve this, we must abstract from all\nrelations of time, and only then see it as it is in itself. What the\nsenses provide us is knowledge of matter in its various divisions,\nshapes, sizes, etc., that is, as matter in its parts as it exists at a\ncertain time and place. Thus, what Desgabets seemed to have assumed\nwas that the reason we so often err with regard to the true nature of\nthese bodies and their movements is that we judge precipitously, or\ntoo quickly, before the mind has had a chance to conceive of material\nsubstance as it is in itself, independent of any temporal or spatial\nties. Thus, it seems that Desgabets holds that the senses provide us\nwith the materials necessary not just for the occasioning of thoughts\nof bodies but also for the knowledge of their essence. \n\nThe sixth consequence bears directly on our ability to see the right\npath to a true and certain physics. The true physics is one that\nrecognizes that \u201ceverything that happens in matter by the\ndifferent movements and modes of its parts, belongs to mathematics and\nmechanics, which have all of this for their object\u201d (OPD 5,\n166). The object of the true physics is not the substantial forms of\nthe Scholastics, but rather, matter whose essence is extension, and\nits modes which are nothing else but various divisions and movements\nof its parts. As Desgabets puts this, the natural object of the\nphysicists is the same as the solid of the mathematician. The solid of\nmathematicians, according to Desgabets, consists in a magnitude that\nhas three dimensions, i.e., length, width, and breadth while the\nnatural body of the physicist consists in a substance extended in\nthree dimensions. This is the crowning statement of Desgabets\u2019s\nmetaphysical view that the physical world is really a single\nobject or substance whose parts, under various divisions, shapes and\narrangements, form all the appearances in the \u201cgrand\ntheater of nature\u201d (OPD 5, 166). Once physics is united with the\ninfallible sciences of mathematics and mechanics, the path to the true\nscience of physics is secure.\n\nHaving surveyed the six consequences of the true nature of sensible\nqualities we can see the heart of Desgabets\u2019s revision of\nCartesianism: that in order to use reason properly we must recognize\nthat all our ideas or simple conceptions have a real object outside of\nit, which is in itself what is represented by thought, and which\nactually contains the degree of being that one sees there. The work of\nthe search after truth is to avoid precipitous judgment and keep to\nthe simple conception of things. If body is extended in three\ndimensions capable of modes of size, shape and motion, and individual\nbodies are modal beings in the sense claimed by Desgabets, then there\nis no cleavage between object and object known because they are one\nand the same thing. Corporeal things cause sensible ideas in us that\nrepresent modes of the mind and cause ideas of bodies, shapes, sizes,\nand motions that represent matter. What is represented to our thought\nthrough simple conception is the real object of knowledge, namely,\nmaterial and spiritual substance. What we sense directly are these\nsubstances as they exist in time, or in other words, as they exist at\na given time by thought in virtue of the particular local\ndispositions of matter.\n4. Truth\n\nAccording to Desgabets, Descartes\u2019s fine doctrine concerning the\ncreation of the eternal truths, is the foundation of the true\n(Cartesian) philosophy. He claimed that had Descartes attended\nconsistently to this doctrine, he would have avoided all error. Due to\nits importance and opaqueness in Desgabets\u2019s writings, the\n\u201cCreation Doctrine\u201d has generated a great deal of\nexamination and debate, most recently stimulated by Beaude\u2019s and\nRodis-Lewis\u2019s publication of Desgabets\u2019s philosophical\nwritings (Desgabets, 1981). Rodis Lewis (1981) and Lennon (1998) set\nthe stage for the dialectic of the debates in the period. Schmaltz\n(2002), Cook (2005), Faye (2005), and Easton (2009) variously argue\nfor the importance of the doctrine in Desgabets\u2019s development of\nthe Cartesian philosophy, and its philosophical significance. Gatto\n(2017) presents a nice synthesis of the literature and sorts out the\ncomplicated reception and role of Descartes\u2019s doctrine,\nparticularly for Desgabets. Despite the controversies surrounding the\ninterpretation and significance of this doctrine, there are some\npoints of agreement. As Desgabets understood it, the Creation Doctrine\nrequires that God be equally the author of all created things, in\ntheir being and their essence. It requires that there be no essence\nwithout existence, which is to say, that there can be no purely\npossible beings either in the human mind as Descartes allowed, or in\nGod\u2019s mind, as Malebranche argued. The notion that such truths\nare in some way prior to God\u2019s creation of the world, existing\nas purely possible essences separate from actual existence, involves a\nseparation of essence from existence, and supposes that essence is\nsomething actually separable and conceivable without existence.\n\nTruth, which exists only by the relation of conformity of thought to\nits object, is contingent in that it depends on God\u2019s will in\nhis free creation of the universe. Truth is eternal in its\nindependence from time or temporal variations, and it is immutable in\nthat once God wills the world, things never change in respect to their\nsubstance but only in respect to their modes of being. Although we\nmust wait to know what things God actually created, we are guaranteed\nof the truth of our ideas since it is the object itself that\ndetermines what we perceive. Truth is necessary in that God gives all\nobjects He creates an irrevocable being, but it is contingent in\nrelation to His absolute and unlimited power. God is the equal author\nof the essence and the existence of things He created, He\n\u201c\u2026 gave them their essence and their existence which are\nequally contingent, and which once received, are nevertheless\npossessed by them irrevocably\u201d (OPD 6, 249). Desgabets\u2019s\nvoluntarism, then, is a qualified one, for though the eternal truths\ndepend upon God for their existence as their primary cause, they are\nno less indefectible, that is, they are unchangeable in their\nsubstantial being. Moreover, eternal truths discovered by us are true\nand necessary since God chose to create things in such a way that once\ncreated his will could not be undone.\n\nThe tenets that Desgabets drew from the Creation Doctrine show us\nwhere Desgabets parts ways with Descartes on many points. For example,\nDescartes erroneously concludes in Meditation V that essences, such as\nthe true and immutable nature of a triangle, can exist separately from\nmaterial existence as a purely possible being. According to\nDesgabets\u2019s strict adherence to the Creation Doctrine,\n\u201c\u2026 objects precede truth in the order of nature,\u201d\nsuch that, \u201c\u2026 it is impossible that there be a triangle\nseparate from its existence, or that the whole be greater than its\npart if there is no whole or parts, which is to say in a word, that\nour principle is found yet more true, and it is impossible to think of\nnothing\u201d (OPD 6, 232). The Creation Doctrine also grounds\nDesgabets\u2019s treatment of the senses as the foundation of all\nknowledge, and his view that the substances are indefectible. Although\nat times elusive, the unity of Desgabets\u2019s thought can be seen\nin his defense of the Creation Doctrine.\n\nTo conclude, when we view Desgabets\u2019s work as a whole, there is\nno doubt that what he viewed as a revision or perfection of the\nCartesian philosophy others have viewed as a fundamental departure. In\nhis favor, he never strayed from the Cartesian metaphysics of\nsubstance dualism, substance-mode ontology, mind-body union and\ninteraction, and the view that extension is the essence of matter and\nthought the essence of mind. He remained loyal to the Cartesian\nphysics against the atomists. Moreover, and perhaps heretically to\nsome, he strongly rejected the rationalist epistemology which often\ndominates in Descartes, and argued that Descartes\u2019s own\nprinciples favor a sensory foundation for knowledge. By\nDesgabets\u2019s own lights, he remained loyal to the Cartesian\nprinciples: \u201cI will establish his reputation upon eternal\nfoundations by giving his philosophy its expected reputation. For, it\nhas to be known that his philosophy, once purged of certain errors and\nhaving received the vast scope possible to it, must pass for the\nmasterpiece of the human spirit, and for what is the greatest of its\nkind in the world\u201d (OPD 5, 152).\n",
