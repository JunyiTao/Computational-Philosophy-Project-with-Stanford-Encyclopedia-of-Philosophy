Is moral goodness a pure perfection?\n\nWe have seen that there are resources to defend the coherence of the\nnotion of perfect goodness and even necessary perfect goodness, though\nmaking use of those resources requires one to take on further\ncontroversial commitments. It is worth asking, in light of these\nfurther commitments that one would have to make, how strong the\nreasons are to ascribe perfect goodness, understood as perfect\nmoral goodness, to the absolutely perfect being in the first\nplace.\n\nIsn\u2019t it obvious that perfect moral goodness is to be ascribed\nto God? After all, we would think of a human being who fails to live\nup to the standards of moral goodness as being imperfect in some way;\nsurely, a fortiori, we ought to think of an omniscient and\nomnipotent being as imperfect if that being fails to be perfectly\nmorally good. But even if it is obviously true that an absolutely\nperfect being must be morally perfect, this is a bad argument for that\nthesis. For the fact that a perfect X must exhibit feature\nF does not show that F is among the perfections of an\nabsolutely perfect being. A perfect frog has webbed toes, but the\nabsolutely perfect being need not have any toes at all, much less\nwebbed ones.\n\nIt is now traditional within perfect being theology to distinguish,\nfollowing John Duns Scotus, between pure perfections and impure, or\nmixed, perfections (Ordinatio 1.3.1, found in\nPhilosophical Writings, p. 24). Pure perfections are those\nthat do not presuppose limitation of some sort, while impure\nperfections do so presuppose. Only pure perfections are features that\nit is simply better to have rather than not to have. Impure\nperfections presuppose some limiting factor that sets the perfection\nin question \u2013 for example, membership in some natural kind. So\nbeing a frog is a relevant sort of limitation, and sets a\nrange of features that count as perfections for instances of that\nkind. But it is not true of these impure perfections that it is simply\nbetter to have them than not to have them; it is not simply better to\nhave webbed toes, a tongue attached at the front of the mouth, and so\nforth, though a frog in good shape will have those features.\n\nSo a key question is whether perfect moral goodness is a pure or\nimpure perfection. Recall that the moral goodness with which we are\nconcerned is familiar welfare-oriented moral goodness, so that while\nit is consistent with moral goodness\u2019s being a pure perfection\nthat what counts as moral goodness may in some way vary from one being\nto another \u2013 the particular content of moral norms may differ\nbetween God and human beings \u2013 it must not vary too\nmuch: the content of moral goodness must involve a positive agential\norientation to human well-being as well as to that of other sentient\nbeings.\n\nThere is a good deal of confidence expressed, particularly in the\ndiscussion of the argument from evil, that moral goodness is a pure\nperfection, but it is not clear whether that confidence is\nwell-placed. \n\nAgainst the notion that it is obvious that moral goodness is a pure\nperfection, it is worth noting that many accounts by which moral norms\nare allegedly explained in a non-debunking way make reference to\nfeatures specific to human life, or at least the life of\nbeings similar to humans in important ways. Humeans, for example,\nappeal to the structure of human sentiments; Hobbesians, to rough\nequality and mutual vulnerability; Aristotelians, to the conditions\nfor the flourishing specific to our kind. None of these accounts is\ndesigned at all to explain why moral norms of the familiar\nwelfare-oriented sort would be applicable to the absolutely perfect\nbeing, and thus give some reason to think that moral goodness is a\npure perfection. This is not to deny that there are some views that\nwould make a better case for moral goodness as pure perfection. If the\nvalue to which agents morally respond is intrinsic value, good in\nitself and giving reasons for action to all agents capable of\nrecognizing and being motivated by it (see, for example, Davison 2012,\np. 12), then we could see why moral goodness would be a pure\nperfection. This would require the working out, defense, and\ncommitment to that particular conception of intrinsic value, one that\nsome theists would take to be in tension with theism itself.\n(Anselm\u2019s own view denies that anything could be good in itself\nother than God (Anselm, Monologion, I, 14); see also Murphy\n2011, pp. 61\u201368.) Kant\u2019s view was that moral norms would\nhave to apply to all rational beings (Groundwork 4: 408), but\nthis thesis is more announced than argued for. At any rate, the key\npoint is that actual theories of moral norms on the ground are not of\none voice about whether moral norms appropriately apply to even the\nabsolutely perfect being, and this gives support to the view that it\nis an open question whether moral goodness is a pure perfection\n(Murphy 2017, 2019a, 2019b).\n\nSome writers have argued that the idea that the goodness of\nGod\u2019s agency is not the moral goodness to which human agents\nought to aspire is a familiar one in the history of philosophy. Davies\nargues that it is a mistake to think that in Aquinas\u2019s view, God\nis \u201cwell-behaved\u201d according to the system of moral law\nthat binds humans (Davies 2011, p. 72); and McCord Adams makes similar\nclaims regarding Scotus\u2019s views (Adams 1987). So here the\ndisagreement is not simply by implication; arguably, there is explicit\nrejection in these major figures of the notion that moral goodness of\na familiar sort is a pure perfection.\n\nIf moral goodness is rejected as a pure perfection, it does not follow\nthat there is no sense in which perfect goodness is a specific\nperfection. After all, we might understand perfect goodness as the\nspecific perfection of divine agency without taking the relevant\nstandards to be the familiar welfare-oriented moral standards.\nGod\u2019s being perfectly good might involve God\u2019s responding\nperfectly to value in a way appropriate for an absolutely perfect\nbeing to do so. It was a common notion in the medieval period to hold\nthat God must love Godself but that God is not necessitated to act by\nthe prospect of the well-being of humans or other sentient creatures.\nThus God did not have to create at all, and needs no reason not to\npromote the well-being of creatures more than God in fact does. (This\nposition is defended in Murphy 2017, 2019a, and 2019b, and in a very\ndifferent way in Rubio 2017.) This position is compatible with the\nnotion that God might place Godself under certain norms contingently,\nby promises, for example. But it would reject the notion that God is\nby nature subject to the same system of norms to which we humans are\nsubject.\n",
