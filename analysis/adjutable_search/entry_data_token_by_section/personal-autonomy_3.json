    "main_text": "Agents as Causes and the Practical Point of View\n4. Agents as Causes and the Practical Point of View\n\n\nEven nonautonomous rational agents authorize the motivating\npower of the desires that move them to act. Yet there is an important\nsense in which the power behind their authorizations is not their own.\nWhat does the relevant impotence amount to? The incompatibilist, we\nsaw, has a ready answer: an agent is prevented from exercising any\npower over her behavior when her authorization of this behavior can be\ntraced to the determining influence of external powers. According to\nthe incompatibilist, if the unwilling addict fails to govern herself,\nthis is because her motives are determined by past states of affair\nover which she does not have (and never did have) any control. And if a\nwilling addict\u2019s motives have a similar genesis, then she,\ntoo, is not accountable for their motivating power.\n\n\nThe familiar problem with this answer is that there seems to be no way\nfor an agent to gain an extra measure of control over her motives\nsimply by acquiring attitudes or judgments or other mental states that\nare not determined by anything else. If someone\u2019s attitude toward her\nmotives is not determined by any earlier state of affairs, then how\ncan it be determined by her? This question pushes some with\nincompatibilist intuitions to attribute a special causal power to\nagents\u2014a power of agency, which is not reducible to the effect\none event has on another. On this view, a person can\n\u201cagent-cause\u201d a certain response to earlier events in a\nway that is not itself the effect of these earlier events. (Chisholm,\nClarke, O\u2019Connor, Taylor, R.) She can bring it about that she is\nmotivated in a certain way, without anything determining her to do so.\nThus, her power over her actions cannot be reduced to the power of\nexternal motivating\n forces.[19]\n\n\nSuch accounts of autonomous agency take seriously the need to\ndistinguish an agent\u2019s power from the power of the psychic forces that\npush and pull her. Yet the obscurities of the special sort of causation\nthey evoke are enough to prevent most philosophers from embracing this\nconception of autonomous agency. To mention just a few familiar\nchallenges: If agent-causing an event does not involve doing something\nto bring it about that the event occurs, then how does the agent exert\nher causal power? and why does this power produce its effects at one\ntime rather than another? If, on the other hand, an agent must do\nsomething in order to agent-cause an action, then doesn\u2019t this require\nthat she undergo some change? and isn\u2019t this change of state itself an\nevent?\n\n\nOn the basis of these and other difficulties, many conclude that the\nappeal to agent-causation provides no more insight into autonomy than\nthe simple assertion that we can sometimes govern the causal efficacy\nof our own motives. Incompatibilists who are sympathetic with this\ncomplaint nonetheless insist that even if an agent\u2019s causal power must\nbe understood in terms of the causal relations among events, autonomous\nagency is possible only if the conditions that immediately give rise to\nan agent\u2019s intention need not suffice to produce it. If, they argue, an\nagent cannot authorize a given action without being determined to do so\nby powers beyond her control, then autonomous agency is an illusion. If\nour every action is an event in a deterministic causal chain, then we\nauthorize our actions only in the sense that a figurehead authorizes\nthe decisions she is forced to sign. Indeed, unlike a political puppet,\nwe do not even have the option of \n defiance[20].\n\n\nOthers see things differently, however. They argue that the\nincompatibilist\u2019s conclusion reflects a misunderstanding of the very\nnature of rational agency. In making their case, they take their lead\nfrom the philosopher who has contributed more than any other to our\nunderstanding of autonomy. Kant, they note, stresses the deep\ndifferences between the two points of view from which we can think\nabout ourselves and our\n world.[21]\n We take up the\ntheoretical point of view in order to gain knowledge about the\nnature of reality, and on this basis make predictions about which\neffects will follow from which causes. When we want to make up our\nminds about what to do, however, we take up the practical\npoint of view. From this point of view, too, we survey the facts that\nare relevant to our decisions. But since none of these facts, taken\nsingly or together, is intrinsically action-guiding, they cannot free\nus from the task of drawing our own conclusions about what we have\nreason to do. (Korsgaard, Bok)\n\nThis is true, the neo-Kantians point out, even if our decisions are\nthe effect of causal powers over which we have no control. Since no\nfacts of which we could possibly become aware can force us to attribute\nany particular significance to them, and since in order to decide what\nto do, we must attribute some significance to the facts of which we are\naware (even if this involves taking them to have no significance at\nall), our decisions are \u201cup to us.\u201d According to those who press this\nline of argument, our authority over our own actions would not be\nillusory even if our mode of exercising it were causally determined by\nevents or states of affairs over which we have no control. Even under\nthese circumstances, no events or states of affairs would have the\npower to determine what we have reason to do. So even under\nthese circumstances, we have to reach our own conclusions on this point\nand acting accordingly. (Note that since this argument relies on the\nconnection between determining what we have reason to do and\ndetermining what we will do, it can also be endorsed by those\nwho take acting for reasons to involve responding to theoretical\nreasons. Indeed, there is a loose sense in which an agent\u2019s point of\nview is \u201cpractical\u201d as long as the truth of her predictions\ndepends on the fact that she makes them.)\n",
