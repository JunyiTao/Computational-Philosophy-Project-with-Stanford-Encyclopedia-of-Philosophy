    "main_text": "Assessment of the Current Standing of The Turing Test || (Logically) Necessary and Sufficient Conditions\n4.1 (Logically) Necessary and Sufficient Conditions\n\nIt is doubtful whether there are very many examples of people who have\nexplicitly claimed that The Turing Test is meant to provide conditions\nthat are both logically necessary and logically sufficient for the\nattribution of intelligence. (Perhaps Block (1981) is one such case.)\nHowever, some of the objections that have been proposed against The\nTuring Test only make sense under the assumption that The Turing Test\ndoes indeed provide logically necessary and logically sufficient\nconditions for the attribution of intelligence; and many more of the\nobjections that have been proposed against The Turing Test only make\nsense under the assumption that The Turing Test provides necessary and\nsufficient conditions for the attribution of intelligence, where the\nmodality in question is weaker than the strictly logical, e.g., nomic\nor causal.\n\nConsider, for example, those people who have claimed that The Turing\nTest is chauvinistic; and, in particular, those people who have\nclaimed that it is surely logically possible for there to be something\nthat possesses considerable intelligence, and yet that is not able to\npass The Turing Test. (Examples: Intelligent creatures might fail to\npass The Turing Test because they do not share our way of life;\nintelligent creatures might fail to pass The Turing Test because they\nrefuse to engage in games of pretence; intelligent creatures might\nfail to pass The Turing Test because the pragmatic conventions that\ngovern the languages that they speak are so very different from the\npragmatic conventions that govern human languages. Etc.) None of this\ncan constitute objections to The Turing Test unless The Turing Test\ndelivers necessary conditions for the attribution of\nintelligence.\n\nFrench (1990) offers ingenious arguments that are intended to show\nthat \u201cthe Turing Test provides a guarantee not of intelligence,\nbut of culturally-oriented intelligence.\u201d But, of course,\nanything that has culturally-oriented intelligence has\nintelligence; so French\u2019s objections cannot be taken to be\ndirected towards the idea that The Turing Test provides sufficient\nconditions for the attribution of intelligence. Rather\u2014as we\nshall see later\u2014French supposes that The Turing Test establishes\nsufficient conditions that no machine will ever satisfy. That is, in\nFrench\u2019s view, what is wrong with The Turing Test is that it\nestablishes utterly uninteresting sufficient conditions for the\nattribution of intelligence.\n\nFloridi and Chiriatti (2020: 683) say that The Turing Test provides\nnecessary but insufficient conditions for intelligence: not passing\nThe Turing Test disqualifies an AI from being intelligent, but passing\nThe Turing Test is not sufficient to qualify an AI as intelligent.\nHowever, they also say that \u201cany reader ... will be well\nacquainted with the nature of the test, so we shall not describe\nit.\u201d The account that they would give of The Turing Test\nmust be quite different from the account of The Turing Test that we\nhave been presenting.\n",
