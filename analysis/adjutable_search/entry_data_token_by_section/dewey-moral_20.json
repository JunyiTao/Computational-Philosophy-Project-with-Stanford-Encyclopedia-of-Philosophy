    "main_text": "Aesthetic Value\n5. Aesthetic Value\n\nDewey\u2019s identification of intelligent reflection with\nexperimental methods might be thought to suggest a narrowly\nscientistic worldview, in which values are reduced to purely\nsubjective, arational \u201coughts\u201d or likings applied to\ninherently value-free facts or natural kinds discovered and defined\nindependently of human valuations. In fact, Dewey\u2019s project aims\nto unify scientific with humanistic inquiry rather than to enforce\ndivisions between the two. While intelligent humanistic inquiry\npartakes of experimental method, scientific inquiry itself is an art\n(EN 285\u20136). The categories in terms of which we make intelligent\nsense of the world are not limited to those which are useful solely\nfor describing objects of abstract, generalized knowledge divorced\nfrom feelings and aspirations. Feelings and aspirations are themselves\npart of the natural world and hence proper subjects of experimental\ninvestigation (EN 316). The job of art is to create objects that\nenhance our capacities for meaningful, appreciative experience.\nCriticism in turn aims to develop meaningful categories that inform\nenriched experiences of objects. \u201cNothing but the best, the\nrichest and fullest experience possible, is good enough for man\u201d\n(EN 308).\n\nFor experiences to be capable of such enrichment, they must be able to\nincorporate intelligent appraisals, just as desires and actions do. To\nthe extent that such incorporation is attentive to the features of the\nobject along with their import, so as to produce a unified, free,\nemotionally engaged, satisfying, appreciative experience of the\nobject, the experience realizes aesthetic value (AE 42\u20133, 47).\nSuch appreciative perception of the object incorporates knowledge of\ncauses and effects. \u201c[T]here enter[s] into the [epicure\u2019s]\ntaste, as directly experienced, qualities that depend upon reference\nto its source and its manner of production in connection with criteria\nof excellence\u201d (AE 55). The listener informed by music theory\nlearns to hear, and thereby take pleasure in, different types of\nmodulation from one key to another, and is thereby primed for certain\nmusical expectations, creating alternating tensions, fulfillments, and\nsurprises as the musical performance unfolds. Similar claims can be\nmade for all of the arts, whether they be \u201cfine\u201d or\n\u201cpractical.\u201d\n\nThe job of the critic is not to pass judgment on the object as a judge\nissues a decision on the basis of precedent, but rather to point out\nmeaningful features in the object in ways that enhance\nobservers\u2019 experience of it (AE 302\u20134). Nor should\naesthetic appraisal of artworks simply consist in applications of\nprior aesthetic standards to currently perceived works of art. Recall\nthat value judgments are instruments that, while they may have been\nfound useful in past cases, may fail to successfully guide current\nconduct. To the extent that a work of art is capable of evoking novel\nappreciative experiences, the application of established standards of\naesthetic value to the work may close off such novelty and reduce the\nexperience of it to a stereotyped, boring recapitulation of past\nexperiences (if the artwork happens to meet the old standard), or,\nworse (if it fails to meet the old standard) provoke a stunted\nreaction of offense or disapproval. In such cases the aesthetic\njudgment would have failed to do its job, which is to enhance\nperception by drawing the observer\u2019s attention to features of\nthe object, and of relations among the object, its creator, and\nobservers, that are understood as meaningful and thereby excite\nfeeling (AE 303). Criticism renders the aesthetic value of an artwork\nobjective to the extent that it succeeds in evoking common\nappreciative experiences among many observers by drawing their\nattention to the same features and relations of the artwork (AE\n312\u20133).\n\nOn Dewey\u2019s expansive understanding of the aesthetic dimension of\nexperience, aesthetic value is not possessed by works of art alone,\nbut can also be possessed by tools and other instruments (EN 283). In\nthe course of repairing a shelf, one might use a hammer and feel its\nheft and balance to be splendidly proportioned for the task, feel the\nhandle to be molded in a way that perfectly fits one\u2019s hand,\nperceive its materials to have been selected with attention to their\nfitness for driving nails, and so forth. Such intelligent appreciation\nof the hammer in one\u2019s direct experience of it amounts to an\naesthetic valuation of it, insofar as the experience itself is savored\nand one\u2019s perceptive faculties are not merely identifying\ninstrumentally valuable features of the hammer for future reference\nbut actively engaged in appreciating the aptness of its design and\nmaterials. The repair job, too, can have aesthetic value to the extent\nthat one experiences it as a unified, smoothly unfolding process,\nbeginning with an astute assessment of the required operations,\nleading to the skilled, fluid, unfrustrated execution of these\noperations, and ending with what is appraised and prized as a\nsuccessful conclusion--the object experienced as satisfactorily\nrepaired. When the experience of this process as aptly unifying means\nand ends absorbs one\u2019s appreciative attention, either as actor\nor as observer, it has aesthetic value.\n\nOn this account, the work process itself can have aesthetic value.\nDewey\u2019s aesthetic theory thus provides the basis for\nunderstanding his critique of work as it exists in societies sharply\ndivided by class. In such societies, the processes of work are reduced\nto merely mechanical operations assigned to a servile class, and\ndivorced from consummatory experiences of the propertied, leisure\nclass that enjoys the products of others\u2019 labor. Class division,\nby divorcing means from ends (production from consumption) and\nintelligent planning from physical operations, reduces physical labor\nto a tedious, mindless, meaningless mechanical exercise of habit,\nwhich thereby lacks aesthetic value in lacking unity and intelligent\nappreciation. The challenge of the modern day is to consider how work,\nand human activity generally, can be reformed so that it has aesthetic\nvalue and is thus no longer valued merely instrumentally (EN\n277\u20138, 307\u20138).\n",
