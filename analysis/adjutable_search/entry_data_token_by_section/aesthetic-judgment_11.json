    "main_text": "Other Features of Aesthetic Judgments || The Primacy of Correctness\n2.5 The Primacy of Correctness\n\nAesthetic judgments have certain essential features, and corresponding\nto those features are certain principles. We can group correctness,\nmind-independence, and nonaesthetic dependence together. However, it\ndoes no harm to focus on the feature of correctness or universal\nvalidity for this is the most basic of the features. If aesthetic\njudgments did not claim correctness or universal validity, they could\nnot claim the other features. If explaining correctness or universal\nvalidity is a problem, then so is explaining mind-independence and\ndependence. But clearly there is a problem about explaining\nall three features. Why does our aesthetic thought have these three\nfeatures and thus operate according to these three principles? And\nwhat is the source of the right of aesthetic judgments to\nthem? Hume and Kant spend much mental effort on these questions. These\npresuppositions of aesthetic judgments need to be explained and\njustified. Given that our aesthetic judgments have these commitments,\nwe need to know how such judgments are possible, how they are actual,\nand how they are legitimate. Having described and analyzed, as we have\ndone here, we need to explain and justify. But, as noted earlier, we\nfirst need a good description of what we are trying to explain and\njustify.\n",
