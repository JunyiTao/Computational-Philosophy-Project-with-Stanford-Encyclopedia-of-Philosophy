    "main_text": "Informational Privacy || Secrecy\n1.2 Secrecy\n\nSissela Bok defined secrecy as intentional concealment (Bok 1982).\nPatients and caregivers can promote privacy through secrecy. Secrecy\npractices loom large in health care. Some people do not share the\nknowledge of medical symptoms even with their closest friends and\nfamily members. A person may secretly know he or she is ill before he\nor she admits it to family members or consults a physician. Reluctance\nto share knowledge of medical symptoms with associates or kin and\nmedical professionals may stem from fear of disability or death;\navoidance of discrimination in insurance, employment and education; or\ndread of social stigma, shame, embarrassment or rejection. In the\n1990s, questions arose about the obligations of dentists and other\nhealth care providers to refrain from secrecy and disclose their HIV\npositive status to patients. Fertility patients may want to conceal\nthe use of donated sperm or eggs, due to the social and religious\nconsequences of disclosure (Birenbaum-Carmeli et al. 2008). Few\nmedical conditions or procedures are shrouded in total secrecy\nanymore. Yet, people may prefer to keep secret the fact of, for\nexample, their elective cosmetic procedures, weight loss surgery, sex\nreassignment surgery, abortions, fertility treatments, and\nsterilizations.\n\nPaternalistically withholding medical knowledge from patients as the\nsecrets of doctors, healthy spouses and adult children pits ideals of\nbeneficence in caregiving against the patient\u2019s right to know.\nPaternalistic secrecy is a major feature of medical practice, more\nprevalent in some countries, communities and families than others.\nMoral ideals of autonomy and agency argue for informing patients of\ntheir medical conditions, truthfully and fully. Yet, medical news is\nsometimes deliberately kept from patients. The adult children of a 95\nyear old woman might think it unduly cruel to reveal the diagnosis of\noperable bowel cancer when she would be better able to cope with the\nfib that she has benign diverticulitis. The parents of a young child\nmight think it kind-hearted to conceal his terminal leukemia from him,\non the ground that he is too young to understand death. Some moralists\nwould agree. Yet if deception is categorically wrong, then secrecy\nabout medical adversity would surely be unethical. A related issue is\nhow medical clinicians and researchers should deal with\n\u201cincidental and secondary findings\u201d: disclose to the\nsubject, or keep confidential within the research team? The return of\nincidental findings may create undue worry and increase medical costs\nby prompting unnecessary medical visits and testing, but the\noverriding obligation may be to anticipate incidental and secondary\nfindings and communicate them with care (Presidential Commission\n2013).\n\nThere is no guarantee that patients will believe medical truths or\ndiagnoses squarely placed before them by qualified physicians. Denial\nof unpleasant truths is commonplace. Self-deception about health is a\npowerful phenomenon. Some people sincerely believe refusing to accept\nan unwanted diagnosis by maintaining a positive attitude will shield\nthem from medical catastrophe. Mental disorders can trick one into\nthinking one is well, happy and insightful, rather than the manic,\ndelusional person the psychiatrist may diagnose.\n\nAnother kind of secrecy practiced in medicine is the concealment of\nsurgical wounds and scars. Cosmetic surgeons hide scars inside\nhairlines and in the creases behind the ears. Breast cancer is no\nlonger the cause for secrecy it once was, yet reconstruction surgery\nfollowing mastectomy is a kind of concealment. The lure of minimally\ninvasive laparoscopic surgery is not only that it may both reduce the\nlength of hospital stays and the risk of infection, but also that it\nleaves less prominent and visible scars. Advances in medical\nimagining, such as the X-ray, MRI, CT scan and ultrasound, allow\nproviders to enter the body and capture information without leaving\ntell-tale signs of having done so.\n\nNeuroimaging, brain imagining technologies (BIT) generally, and\nadvanced lie-detection raise critical questions about whether secret\nthoughts should be available for discernment, and if so under what\ncircumstances (Presidential Commission 2014; Farahany 2012). The issue\nis one of coerced self-disclosure and, if someday criminal guilt could\nbe reliably discerned from imaging, self-incrimination.\n",
