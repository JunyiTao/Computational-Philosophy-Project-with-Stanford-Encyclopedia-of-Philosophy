    "main_text": "Outline of scientific debates over nativism || Ethology and the revival of instinct psychology\n1.4 Ethology and the revival of instinct psychology\n\nDespite its eclipse by behaviorism in North America, the study of\ninstinct was rehabilitated in Europe on either side of World War Two\nby the founders of ethology, Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen\n(Tinbergen 1942; 1951; Lorenz 1957 (1937); Lorenz and Tinbergen 1957\n(1938)). Ethology was a Darwinian approach to behavior and the direct\nancestor of today\u2019s behavioral ecology and sociobiology. It\ntreated an organism\u2019s behavior as simply one more evolved\ncharacteristic alongside its skeleton and its digestive system. Innate\nbehavior was thought to be composed of identifiable units \u2013\n\u2018fixed action patterns\u2019 \u2013 whose evolution could be\nstudied like that of a bone by comparing the different form taken by\nthe same (homologous) behavior in different species. The evolutionary\nrelationships of birds, for example, were thought by the early\nethologists to be reflected in similarities and differences in their\ncourtship rituals as reliably as in similarities and differences in\ntheir bones.\n\nIn their early work, Lorenz and Tinbergen drew a sharp distinction\nbetween innate vs acquired behavior. An innate behavior was thought to\nbe, (1) stereotyped or constant in form, (2) species-typical, (3)\ncapable of developing in socially isolated animals, and (4) capable of\ndeveloping \u201cfully formed\u201d in animals which had been\ndeprived of opportunities to practice it (Lehrman 1953). Early\nethologists placed considerable emphasis on the \u2018deprivation\nexperiment\u2019 as a method for distinguishing innate from acquired\nbehaviors. These experiments involved raising an animal without the\nopportunity to learn a behavior and then testing to see if it can\nperform the behavior when provided with an appropriate stimulus. A\nsongbird, for example, can be raised from egg to adult without hearing\na member of its own species sing, and tested to see which song it\nproduces the following spring. If it produces the typical song of its\nown species, then the song was deemed innate. For more on Lorenz and\nTinbergen\u2019s ideas about instinct, see (Richards 1974; Griffiths\n2004; Brigandt 2005; Browne 2005; Burkhardt 2005).\n\nThe idea of instinct in classical ethology was strongly criticized by\nseveral North American psychologists including Theodore C. Schneirla\n(1952; 1963; 1966), Howard Moltz (1960; 1965), and most famously by\nSchneirla\u2019s student Daniel S. Lehrman in \u2018A critique of\nKonrad Lorenz\u2019s theory of instinctive behavior\u2019 (1953).\nLehrman objected to ethologists\u2019 resurrection of the innateness\nconcept on both empirical and theoretical grounds. Empirically,\nLehrman documented the role of environmental factors in the\ndevelopment of species-typical behavior patterns, drawing on many\nexisting studies, including some by Kuo. These experiments revealed\nthat certain prototypical fixed action patterns depend on\nenvironmental feedback for their development. This is true despite the\nfact that such behaviors are species-typical and present in animals\nthat were raised in isolation. For Lehrman, such evidence undermined\nthe attempt to distinguish innate from acquired behavior:\n\nin each case, analysis of the developmental process involved shows\nthat the behavior patterns concerned are not unitary, autonomously\ndeveloping things, but rather that they emerge ontogenetically in\ncomplex ways from the previously developed organization of the\norganism in a given setting. (Lehrman 1953, 343)\n\n\nLehrman was particularly critical of the use of the deprivation\nexperiment to infer that a certain trait is innate\nsimpliciter, rather than merely that the factors controlled\nfor in the experiment are not needed for the development of that\ntrait.\n\nMany of Lehrman\u2019s ideas were incorporated into mainstream\nethological theory. By the 1960s Tinbergen regarded the use of the\nterm \u2018innate\u2019 to characterize behaviors as\n\u201cheuristically harmful\u201d (Tinbergen 1963, 425) and endorsed\nLehrman\u2019s critique of the deprivation experiment: \u201cThe\nconclusion can only be formulated correctly in negative terms, in\ndescribing which environmental aspect was shown not to be\ninfluential\u201d (Tinbergen 1963, 424). In the same period Tinbergen\nand his students shifted the focus of their research from behaviors as\nstable taxonomic characters to behaviors as adaptations shaped by the\necological demands of the environment (Burkhardt 2005). Determining\nthe extent to which behavior develops independently of the environment\nceased to be important to the Tinbergen school, or to the new\ndiscipline of behavioral ecology in which students of Tinbergen like\nRichard Dawkins played such a prominent role. Interest turned instead\nto testing population genetic and game theoretic models of behavioral\nevolution.\n\nLorenz responded to his critics with a revised account of the\ninnate/acquired distinction (Lorenz 1965; see also Browne 2005). No\ntrait is innate in itself, but \u201ccertain parts of the information\nwhich underly the adaptedness of the whole, and which can be\nascertained by the deprivation experiment, are indeed innate\u201d\n(Lorenz 1965, 40). A trait is innate insofar as its development is\nguided by \u2018inherited information\u2019 rather than\n\u2018environmental information.\u2019 Lorenz defined\n\u2018information\u2019 in terms of adaptation. An adaptive trait\n\u2018fits\u2019 its environment and hence can be said to contain\ninformation about that environment just as a key can be said to\ncontain information about the lock it will open. The question is where\nthat information comes from \u2013 how does the organism\n\u2018know\u2019 about its environment? If a woman has calluses on\nher palms rather than on the backs of her hands, this represents\ninformation about where her skin gets rubbed most. If she were\nborn with calluses on her palms, as ostriches are born with\ncalluses that match pressure points on their legs, this would imply\nadvance \u2018knowledge\u2019 of where her skin is going to be\nrubbed most. Such anticipatory information, Lorenz argued, must be in\nthe genome. It is in the genome as a result of natural selection,\nwhich can be seen as a form of trial-and-error learning.\n\nLorenz\u2019s analysis can readily be expressed in\ninformation-theoretic terms, with the environment as the signal source\nand the organism as the receiver. Organisms need to reduce their\nuncertainty about what demands the environment will place on them and\nto develop in a way that meets those demands. There are two ways to do\nthis. The first way is to gather information about the environment\nduring development. The water flea Daphnia pulex monitors\nchemical traces of predators as it develops. If an individual flea\ndetects evidence that predators are present, then that flea grows\ndefensive armor. Thus, a flea\u2019s possession or lack of defensive\narmour reflects environmental information. The alternative is to\ninherit information from your ancestors. The human sickle cell allele\nhas harmful effects in homozygotes and survives in a population only\nbecause it confers resistance to malaria in heterozygotes. Hence the\nfact that an individual carries the allele provides information about\nthe prevalence of malaria in the ancestral environment and thus,\nprobably, in the environment of the organism which inherits the\nallele. The sickle cell allele can thus be seen as passing on\ninformation about the environment which was \u2018learnt\u2019 by\nancestors through natural selection. To the extent that the functional\nadjustment of a trait to its environment is explained by\n\u2018inherited information\u2019 of this kind, Lorenz argued, the\ntrait is innate. Hence, albeit in a very different way from Tinbergen,\nLorenz also came to see whether a behavior is an adaptation as the key\nissue.\n",
