    "main_text": "Antirealism\n5. Antirealism \n\nThe majority of contemporary philosophers are realists about\nlaws; they believe that some reports of what the laws are succeed in\ndescribing reality. There are, however, some antirealists who\ndisagree.\n\nFor example, van Fraassen, Giere, and also Mumford believe that\nthere are no laws. Van Fraassen finds support for his view in the\nproblems facing accounts like Lewis\u2019s and Armstrong\u2019s, and\nthe perceived failure of Armstrong and others to describe an adequate\nepistemology that permits rational belief in laws (1989,\n130, 180\u2013181). Giere appeals to the origins of the use of\nthe concept of law in the history of science (1999 [f.p. 1995],\n86\u201390) and contends that the generalizations often described as\nlaws are not in fact true (90\u201391). Mumford\u2019s reasons are\nmore metaphysical; he maintains that, in order to govern, laws must be\nexternal to the properties they govern, but, to be external in this\nway, the governed properties must lack proper identity conditions\n(2004, 144\u2013145). Others adopt a subtly different sort of\nantirealism. Though they will utter sentences like \u2018It is a law\nthat no signals travel faster than light\u2019, they are antirealists\nin virtue of thinking that such sentences are not (purely)\nfact-stating. Whether this Einsteinian generalization is a law is not\na fact about the universe; it is not something out there waiting to be\ndiscovered. Reports of what are laws only project a certain attitude\n(in addition to belief) about the contained generalizations (Blackburn\n1984, 1986, Ward 2002, 197). Ward takes the attitude to be one\nregarding the suitability of the generalization for prediction and\nexplanation. \n\nThe challenge for antirealism is to minimize the havoc lawless reality\nwould play with our folk and scientific practices. Regarding science,\nthe examples and uses of laws described at the start of this entry\nattest to \u2018law\u2019 having a visible role in science that\nscientists seem prepared to take as factive. Regarding our folk\npractices, though \u2018law\u2019 is not often part of\nrun-of-the-mill conversations, an antirealism about lawhood would\nstill have wide-ranging consequences. This is due to lawhood\u2019s\nties to other concepts, especially the nomic ones, concepts\nlike the counterfactual conditional, dispositions, and causation. For\nexample, it seems that, for there to be any interesting counterfactual\ntruths, there must be at least one law of nature. Would an ordinary\nmatch in ordinary conditions light if struck? It seems it would, but\nonly because we presume nature to be regular in certain ways. We think\nthis counterfactual is true because we believe there are laws. Were\nthere no laws, it would not be the case that, if the match were\nstruck, it would light. As a result, it would also not be the case\nthat the match was disposed to ignite, nor the case that\nstriking the match would cause it to light.\n\nCould an antirealist deflect this challenge by denying the connections\nbetween lawhood and other concepts? Would this allow one to be an\nantirealist about laws and still be a realist about, say,\ncounterfactuals? The danger lurking here is that the resulting\nposition seems bound to be ad hoc. Concepts like the\ncounterfactual conditional, dispositions, and causation exhibit many\nof the same puzzling features that lawhood does; there are parallel\nphilosophical questions and puzzles about these concepts. It is hard\nto see what would warrant antirealism about lawhood, but not the other\nnomic concepts.\n",
