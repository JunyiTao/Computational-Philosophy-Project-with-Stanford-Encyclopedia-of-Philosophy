Chaos, Determinism and Quantum Mechanics\n\nOne of the exciting features of SDIC is that there is no lower limit\non just how small some change or perturbation can be\u2014the\nsmallest of effects will eventually be amplified up affecting the\nbehavior of any system exhibiting SDIC. A number of authors have\nargued that chaos through SDIC opens a door for quantum mechanics to\n\u201cinfect\u201d chaotic classical mechanics systems (e.g.,\nHobbs 1991; Barone et al. 1993; Kellert 1993; Bishop 2008). [7] \nThe essential point is that the nature of\nparticular kinds of nonlinear dynamics\u2014those which exhibit\nstretching and folding (confinement) of trajectories, where there are\nno trajectory crossings, and which exhibit aperiodic\norbits\u2014apparently open the door for quantum effects to change\nthe behavior of chaotic macroscopic systems. The central argument runs\nas follows and is known as the sensitive dependence argument (SD\nargument for short):\n\n\nFor systems exhibiting SDIC, trajectories starting out in a\n highly localized region of state space will diverge on-average\n exponentially fast from one another.\nQuantum mechanics limits the precision with which physical\n systems can be specified to a neighborhood in phase space of no\n less than \\(1/(2\\pi/h)^{N}\\),\n where \\(h\\) is Plank\u2019s constant (with units of action)\n and \\(N\\) is the dimension of the system in question.\nGiven enough time and the quantum mechanical bound on the\n neighborhood \\(\\varepsilon\\) for the initial conditions, two\n trajectories of the same chaotic system will have future states\n localizable to a much larger region \\(\\delta\\) in phase space (from\n (A) and (B)).\nTherefore, quantum mechanics will influence the outcomes of\n chaotic systems leading to a violation of unique evolution.\n\n\nPremise (A) makes clear that SD is the operative definition for\ncharacterizing chaotic behavior in this argument, invoking exponential\ngrowth characterized by the largest global Lyapunov exponent. Premise\n(B) expresses the precision limit for the state of minimum uncertainty\nfor momentum and position pairs in an \\(N\\)-dimensional quantum\nsystem (note, the exponent is \\(2N\\) in the case of uncorrelated\nelectrons).[8] The\nconclusion of the argument in the form given here is actually stronger\nthan that quantum mechanics can influence a macroscopic system\nexhibiting SDIC; determinism fails for such systems because of such\ninfluences. Briefly, the reasoning runs as follows. Because of SDIC,\nnonlinear chaotic systems whose initial states can be located only\nwithin a small neighborhood \\(\\varepsilon\\) of state space will have future\nstates that can be located only within a much larger patch\n\\(\\delta\\). For example, two isomorphic nonlinear systems of classical\nmechanics exhibiting SDIC, whose initial states are localized within\n\\(\\varepsilon\\), will have future states that can be localized only within\n\\(\\delta\\). Since quantum mechanics sets a lower bound on the size of the\npatch of initial conditions, unique evolution must fail for nonlinear\nchaotic systems.\n\n\nThe SD argument does not go through as smoothly as some of its\nadvocates have thought, however. There are difficult issues regarding\nthe appropriate version of quantum mechanics (e.g., von\nNeumann, Bohmian or decoherence theories; see entries\nunder\n quantum mechanics),\n the nature of quantum measurement theory (collapse vs. non-collapse\ntheories; see the section on the measurement problem in \nthe entry on \n philosophical issues in quantum theory),\nand the selection of the initial state characterizing the system that\nmust be resolved before one can say clearly whether or not unique\nevolution is violated. For instance, just because\nquantum effects might influence macroscopic chaotic systems doesn\u2019t\nguarantee that determinism fails for such systems. Whether quantum\ninteractions with nonlinear macroscopic systems exhibiting SDIC\ncontribute indeterministically to the outcomes of such\nsystems depends on the currently undecidable question of indeterminism\nin quantum mechanics and the measurement problem as well as on how one\nchooses to the system-measurement apparatus cut (Bishop 2008). \n\nTo expand on one issue, there is a serious open question as to whether\nthe indeterminism in quantum mechanics is simply the result of\nignorance due to epistemic limitations or if it is an ontological\nfeature of the quantum world. Suppose that quantum mechanics is\nultimately deterministic, but that there is some additional factor, a\nhidden variable as it is often called, such that if this variable were\navailable to us, our description of quantum systems would be fully\ndeterministic. Another possibility is that there is an interaction\nwith the broader environment that accounts for how the probabilities\nin quantum mechanics arise (physicists call this approach\n\u201cdecoherence\u201d). Under either of these possibilities, we\nwould interpret the indeterminism observed in quantum mechanics as an\nexpression of our ignorance, and, hence, indeterminism would not be a\nfundamental feature of the quantum domain. It would be merely\nepistemic in nature due to our lack of knowledge or access to\nquantum systems. So if the indeterminism in QM is not ontologically\ngenuine, then whatever contribution quantum effects make to macroscopic\nsystems exhibiting SDIC would not violate unique evolution. In\ncontrast, suppose it is the case that quantum mechanics is genuinely\nindeterministic; that is, all the relevant factors of quantum systems\ndo not fully determine their behavior at any given moment. Then the\npossibility exists that not all physical systems traditionally thought\nto be in the domain of classical mechanics can be described using\nstrictly deterministic models, leading to the need to approach the\nmodeling of such nonlinear systems differently.\n\n\nMoreover, the possible constraints of nonlinear classical mechanics\nsystems on the amplification of quantum effects must be considered on\na case-by-case basis. For instance, damping due to friction can place\nconstraints on how quickly amplification of quantum effects can take\nplace before they are completely washed out (Bishop 2008). And\none has to investigate the local finite-time dynamics for each system\nbecause these may not yield any on-average growth in uncertainties\n(e.g., Smith, Ziehmann, Fraedrich 1999).\n\n\nIn summary, there is no abstract, a priori reasoning establishing\nthe truth of the SD argument; the argument can only be demonstrated on a\ncase-by-case basis. Perhaps detailed examination of several cases would\nenable us to make some generalizations about how wide spread the\npossibilities for the amplification of quantum effects are.\n\n",
