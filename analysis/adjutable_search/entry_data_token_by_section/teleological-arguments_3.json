    "main_text": "Design Inference Patterns || Deductive Design Arguments: Schema 2\n2.2 Deductive Design Arguments: Schema 2\n\nBut some advocates of design arguments had been reaching for a deeper\nintuition. The intuition they were attempting to capture involved\nproperties that constituted some degree of evidence for design, not\njust because such properties happened to be often or even only\nproduced by designing agents. Advocates were convinced that the\nappropriate Rs in question were in their own right directly\nreflective of and redolent of cognition, that this directly suggested\nmind, that we could see nearly directly that they were the\ngeneral sort of thing that a mind might or even\nwould generate, and that consequently they did not depend for\ntheir evidential force upon previously established known instances of\ndesign. When we see a text version of the Gettysburg Address, that\ntext says mind to us in a way totally unrelated to any\ninduction or analogy from past encounters with\nwritten texts. It was that type of testimony to mind, to design, that\nsome historical advocates of design arguments believed that they found\nin some Rs observed in nature\u2014a testimony having no\ndependency on induction or analogy. Beauty, purpose and in general\nvalue especially when conjoined with delicate complexity were\npopular underlying intuitive marks. Intricate, dynamic, stable,\nfunctioning order of the sort we encounter in nature was frequently\nplaced in this category. Such order was taken to be suggestive of\nminds in that it seemed nearly self-evidently the sort of thing minds\nwere prone to produce. It was a property whose\nmind-resonating character we could unhesitatingly attribute\nto intent.\n\nDespite Hume\u2019s earlier demurs that things in nature are not\nreally very like artifacts such as machines, most people who are most\nfamiliar with nature\u2019s dazzling intricacies freely admit that\nnature abounds with things that look designed\u2014that are\nintention-shaped. For instance, Francis Crick (no fan of\ndesign) issued a warning to his fellow biologists:\n\nBiologists must constantly keep in mind that what they see was not\ndesigned, but rather evolved. (Crick 1988, 138).\n\n\nAlong with this perception of mind-suggestiveness went a further\nprinciple\u2014that the mind-suggestive or design-like\ncharacteristics in question were too palpable to have been generated\nby non-intentional means.\n\nThat allows specification of a second design inference pattern:\n\n\nSchema 2:\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are\ndesign-like (exhibit a cognition-resonating, intention-shaped\ncharacter R)\nDesign-like properties (R) are not producible by\n(unguided) natural means\u2014i.e., any phenomenon exhibiting such\nRs must be a product of intentional design.\n\n\nTherefore\n\nSome things in nature (or nature itself, the cosmos) are products\nof intentional design, which in turn requires agency of some\ntype.\n\n\n\nNotice that explicit reference to human artifacts has dropped\nout of the argument, and that the argument is no longer comparative\nbut has become essentially deductive. Some arguments were historically\nintended as arguments of that type. William Paley famously sees no\ndesign-like properties in a stone, but finding a watch on the ground\nwould be another matter. Unlike the stone, it could not always have\nbeen there. Why\n not?[1]\n\nFor this reason, and for no other, namely, that when we come to\ninspect the watch, we perceive\u2014what we could not discover in the\nstone\u2014that its several parts are framed and put together for a\npurpose \u2026 [The requisite] mechanism being observed \u2026 the\ninference we think is inevitable, that the watch must have had a\nmaker. ... Every observation which was made in our first chapter\nconcerning the watch may be repeated with strict propriety concerning\nthe eye, concerning animals, concerning plants, concerning, indeed,\nall the organized parts of the works of nature. \u2026 [T]he\neye \u2026 would be alone sufficient to support the\nconclusion which we draw from it, as to the necessity of an\nintelligent Creator. \u2026\n\n\nAlthough Paley\u2019s argument is routinely construed as analogical,\nit contains an informal statement of the above variant argument type.\nPaley goes on for two chapters discussing the watch, discussing the\nproperties in it which evince design, and destroying potential\nobjections to concluding design in the watch. It is only then that\nentities in nature\u2014e.g., the eye\u2014come onto the horizon.\nPaley isn\u2019t trying to persuade his readers that the watch is\ndesigned and has a designer. He is teasing out the bases and\nprocedures from and by which we should and should not reason about\ndesign and designers. Thus Paley\u2019s use of the term\n\u2018inference\u2019 in connection with the watch\u2019s\n designer.[2]\n\nOnce having acquired the relevant principles, then in Chapter 3 of\nNatural Theology\u2014\u201cApplication of the\nArgument\u201d\u2014Paley applies the same\nargument (vs. presenting us with the other half of the analogical\nargument) to things in nature. The cases of human artifacts and nature\nrepresent two separate inference instances:\n\nup to the limit, the reasoning is as clear and certain in the one case\nas in the other. (Paley 1802 [1963], 14)\n\n\nBut the instances are instances of the same inferential\nmove:\n\nthere is precisely the same proof that the eye was made for\nvision as there is that the telescope was made for assisting it.\n(Paley 1802 [1963], 13)\n\n\nThe watch does play an obvious and crucial role\u2014but as a\nparadigmatic instance of design inferences rather than as the\nanalogical foundation for an inferential comparison.\n\nSchema 2, not being analogically structured, would not be vulnerable\nto the ills of\n analogy,[3]\n and not being inductive would claim more than mere probability for\nits conclusion. That is not accidental. Indeed, it has been argued\nthat Paley was aware of Hume\u2019s earlier attacks on analogical\ndesign arguments, and deliberately structured his argument to avoid\nthe relevant pitfalls (Gillispie 1990, 214\u2013229).\n2.2.1 Assessing the Schema 2 argument\n\nFirst, how are we to assess the premises required by this schema?\nPremise (5), at least, is not particularly controversial even now.\nCrick\u2019s earlier warning to biologists would have been pointless\nwere there no temptation toward design attributions, and even as\nimplacable a contemporary opponent of design arguments as Richard\nDawkins characterized biology as:\n\nthe study of complicated things that give the appearance of having\nbeen designed for a purpose. (Dawkins 1987, 1)\n\n\nDay-to-day contemporary biology is rife with terms like\n\u2018design\u2019, \u2018machine\u2019, \u2018purpose\u2019,\nand allied terms. As historian of science Timothy Lenoir has\nremarked:\n\nTeleological thinking has been steadfastly resisted by modern biology.\nAnd yet, in nearly every area of research biologists are hard pressed\nto find language that does not impute purposiveness to living forms.\n(Lenoir 1982, ix)\n\n\nWhether or not particular biological phenomena are designed, they are\nfrequently enough design-like to make design language not\nonly fit living systems extraordinarily well, but to undergird the\ngeneration of fruitful theoretical\n conceptions.[4]\n Advocates of design arguments claim that the reason why theorizing\nas if organisms are designed meets with such success is that\norganisms are in fact designed. Those opposed would say that\nall teleological concepts in biology must, in one way or another, be\nreduced to natural selection.\n\nHowever, principle (6) (that the relevant design-like properties are\nnot producible by unguided natural means) will be more problematic in\nevolutionary biology. What might be the rational justification for\n(6)? There are two broad possibilities.\n\n1. Empirical: induction. Induction essentially involves\nestablishing that some principle holds within the realm of our\nexperience (the sample cases), and then generalizing the\nprinciple to encompass relevant areas beyond that realm (the\ntest cases). The attempt to establish the universality of a\nconnection between having relevant Rs and being a product of\nmind on the basis of an observed consistent connection between having\nrelevant Rs and being a product of mind within all (most) of\nthe cases where both R was exhibited and we knew\nwhether or not the phenomenon in question was a product of mind, would\nconstitute an inductive generalization.\n\nThis approach would suffer from a variety of weaknesses. The\nR-exhibiting things concerning which we knew whether they\nwere designed would be almost without exception human artifacts,\nwhereas the phenomena to which the generalization was being extended\nwould be things in nature. And, of course, the generalization in\nquestion could establish at best a probability, and a fairly modest\none at that.\n\n2. Conceptual. It might be held that (6) is known in the same\nconceptual, nearly a priori way in which we know\nthat textbooks are not producible by natural processes unaided by\nmind. And our conviction here is not based on any mere induction from\nprior experiences of texts. Texts carry with them essential marks of\nmind, and indeed in understanding a text we see at least partway into\nthe mind(s) involved. Various alien artifacts (if any)\u2014of which\nwe have had no prior experience whatever\u2014could fall into this\ncategory as well. Similarly, it has been held that we sometimes\nimmediately recognize that order of the requisite sort just\nis a sign of mind and intent.\n\nAlternatively, it could be argued that although there is a genuine\nconceptual link between appropriate Rs and mind, design,\nintent, etc., that typically our recognition of that link is\ntriggered by specific experiences with artifacts. On this view, once\nthe truth of (6) became manifest to us through those experiences, the\nappropriateness of its more general application would be clear. That\nmight explain why so many advocates of design arguments seem to\nbelieve that they must only display a few cases and raise\ntheir eyebrows to gain assent to design.\n\nEither way, principle (6), or something like it, would be something\nwith which relevant design inferences would begin. Further\ninvestigation of (6) requires taking a closer look at the Rs\nwhich (6) involves.\n2.2.2 R Concerns: Round 2\n\nOne thing complicating general assessments of design arguments is that\nthe evidential force of specific Rs is affected by the\ncontext of their occurrence. Specifically, properties which seem to\nconstitute marks of design in known artifacts often seem to have\nsignificantly less evidential import outside that context. For\ninstance, we typically construe enormous complexity in something known\nto be a manufactured artifact as a deliberately intended and produced\ncharacteristic. But mere complexity in contexts not taken to involve\nartifacts (the precise arrangement of pine needles on a forest floor,\nfor instance) does not seem to have that same force. In the case of\nnatural objects, it is less clear that such complexity\u2014as well\nas the other traditional empirical Rs\u2014bespeaks\nintention, plan, and purpose.\n\nFurthermore, even within those two contexts\u2014artifact and\nnature\u2014the various Rs exhibit varying degrees of\nevidential force. For instance, even in an artifact, mere complexity\nof whatever degree speaks less clearly of intent than does an engraved\nsentence. As most critics of design arguments point out, the examples\nfound in nature are not of the \u201cengraved sentence\u201d\nsort.\n2.2.3 Gaps and Their Discontents\n\nEvidential ambiguity would virtually disappear if it became clear that\nthere is no plausible means of producing some R independent\nof deliberate intent. Part of the persuasiveness of (6) historically\ncame from absence of any known plausible non-intentional alternative\ncausal account of the traditional Rs. Such cases are often\nlinked to alleged gaps in nature\u2014phenomena for which, it is\nclaimed, there can be no purely natural explanation, there being a gap\nbetween nature\u2019s production capabilities and the phenomenon in\nquestion. (For example, nature\u2019s unaided capabilities fall short\nof producing a radio.) Design cases resting upon nature\u2019s\nalleged inability to produce some relevant \u2018natural\u2019\nphenomenon are generally assumed to explicitly or implicitly appeal to\nsupernatural agency, and are typically described as\n\u201cGod-of-the-gaps\u201d arguments\u2014a description usually\nintended to be pejorative.\n\nThe position that there are causal gaps in nature is not\ninherently irrational\u2014and would seem to be a legitimate\nempirical question. But although gaps would profoundly strengthen\ndesign arguments, they have their suite of difficulties. Gaps are\nusually easy to spot in cases of artifactuality (take the radio\nexample, again), but although they may be present in nature,\nestablishing their existence there can usually be done (by\nscience, at least) only indirectly\u2014via probability\nconsiderations, purported limitations on nature\u2019s abilities,\netc.\n\nSeveral possible snags lurk. Gaps in nature would, again, suggest\nsupernatural agency, and some take science to operate under an\nobligatory exclusion of such. This prohibition\u2014commonly known as\nmethodological naturalism\u2014is often claimed (mistakenly,\nsome argue) to be definitive of genuine\n science.[5]\n While such \u201cestablished\u201d limitations on science have been\noverturned in the past, the spotty track record of alleged gaps\nprovides at least a cautionary note. Purported gaps have been closed\nby new scientific theories postulating means of natural production of\nphenomena previously thought to be beyond nature\u2019s capabilities.\nThe most obvious example of that is, of course, Darwin\u2019s\nevolutionary theory and its descendants.\n",
