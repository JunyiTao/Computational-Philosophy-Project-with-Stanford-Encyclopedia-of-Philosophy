    "main_text": "Open Science Reforms: Values, Tone, and Scientific Norms || Methods and Training\n4.1 Methods and Training\n\nCombating bias. The development of methods for combating\nbias, for example, masked or blind analysis techniques to combat\nconfirmation bias (e.g., MacCoun & Perlmutter 2017).\nSupport. Providing methodological support for\nresearchers, including published guidelines and statistical\nconsultancy (for example, as offered by the Center for Open Science)\nand large online courses such as that developed by Daniel Lakens (see\n Other Internet Resources).\nCollaboration. Promoting collaboration and team/crowd\nsourced science to combat low power and other methodological\nlimitations of single studies. The Reproducibility Projects themselves\nare an example of this, but there are other initiatives too such\nStudySwap in psychology and the Collective Replication and Education\nProject (CREP, see\n Other Internet Resources\n for both of these , see also Munaf\u00f2 et al. for a more detailed\ndescription) which aims to increase the prevalence of replications\nthrough undergraduate education.\n\n",
