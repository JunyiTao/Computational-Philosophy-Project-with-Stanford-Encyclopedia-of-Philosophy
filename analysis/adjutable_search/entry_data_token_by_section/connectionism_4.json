The Shape of the Controversy between Connectionists and Classicists\n\nThe last forty years have been dominated by the classical view that\n(at least higher) human cognition is analogous to symbolic computation\nin digital computers. On the classical account, information is\nrepresented by strings of symbols, just as we represent data in\ncomputer memory or on pieces of paper. The connectionist claims, on\nthe other hand, that information is stored non-symbolically in the\nweights, or connection strengths, between the units of a neural net.\nThe classicist believes that cognition resembles digital processing,\nwhere strings are produced in sequence according to the instructions\nof a (symbolic) program. The connectionist views mental processing as\nthe dynamic and graded evolution of activity in a neural net, each\nunit\u2019s activation depending on the connection strengths and\nactivity of its neighbors.\n\nOn the face of it, these views seem very different. However many\nconnectionists do not view their work as a challenge to classicism and\nsome overtly support the classical picture. So-called implementational\nconnectionists seek an accommodation between the two paradigms. They\nhold that the brain\u2019s net implements a symbolic processor. True,\nthe mind is a neural net; but it is also a symbolic processor at a\nhigher and more abstract level of description. So the role for\nconnectionist research according to the implementationalist is to\ndiscover how the machinery needed for symbolic processing can be\nforged from neural network materials, so that classical processing can\nbe reduced to the neural network account.\n\nHowever, many connectionists resist the implementational point of\nview. Such radical connectionists claim that symbolic processing was a\nbad guess about how the mind works. They complain that classical\ntheory does a poor job of explaining graceful degradation of function,\nholistic representation of data, spontaneous generalization,\nappreciation of context, and many other features of human intelligence\nwhich are captured in their models. The failure of classical\nprogramming to match the flexibility and efficiency of human cognition\nis by their lights a symptom of the need for a new paradigm in\ncognitive science. So radical connectionists would eliminate symbolic\nprocessing from cognitive science forever.\n\nThe controversy between radical and implementational connectionists is\ncomplicated by the invention of what are called hybrid connectionist\narchitectures. Here elements of classical symbolic processing are\nincluded in neural nets (Wermter & Sun 2000). For example,\nMiikkulainen (1993) champions a complex collection of neural net\nmodules that share data coded in activation patterns. Since one of the\nmodules acts as a memory, the system taken as a whole resembles a\nclassical processor with separate mechanisms for storing and operating\non digital \u201cwords\u201d. Smolensky (1990) is famous for\ninventing so called tensor product methods for simulating the process\nof variable binding, where symbolic information is stored at and\nretrieved from known \u201clocations\u201d. More recently, Eliasmith\n(2013) has proposed complex and massive architectures that use what\nare called semantic pointers, which exhibit features of classical\nvariable binding. Once hybrid architectures such as these are on the\ntable, it becomes more difficult to classify a given connectionist\nmodel as radical or merely implementational. This opens the\ninteresting prospect that whether symbolic processing is actually\npresent in the human brain may turn out to be a matter of degree.\n\nThe disagreement concerning the degree to which human cognition\ninvolves symbolic processing is naturally embroiled with the\ninnateness debate\u2014whether higher level abilities such as\nlanguage and reasoning are part of the human genetic endowment, or\nwhether they are learned. The success of connectionist models at\nlearning tasks starting from randomly chosen weights gives heart to\nempiricists, who would think that the infant brain is able to\nconstruct intelligence from perceptual input using a simple learning\nmechanism (Elman et al. 1996). On the other hand, nativists in the\nrationalist tradition argue that at least for grammar-based language,\nthe poverty of perceptual stimulus (Chomsky 1965: 58) entails the\nexistence of a genetically determined mechanism tailored to learning\ngrammar. However, the alignment between connectionism and non-nativism\nis not so clear-cut. There is no reason that connectionist models\ncannot be interpreted from a nativist point of view, where the ongoing\n\u201clearning\u201d represents the process of evolutionary\nrefinement from generation to generation of a species. The idea that\nthe human brain has domain specific knowledge that is genetically\ndetermined can be accommodated in the connectionist paradigm by\nbiasing the initial weights of the models to make that knowledge easy\nor trivial to learn. Connectionist research makes best contact with\nthe innateness debate by providing a new strategy for disarming\npoverty of stimulus arguments. Nativists argue that association of\nideas, the mechanism for learning proposed by the traditional\nempiricist, is too slender a reed to support the development of higher\nlevel cognitive abilities. They suppose that innate mechanisms are\nessential for learning (for example) a grammar of English from a\nchild\u2019s linguistic input, because the statistical regularities\navailable to \u201cmere association\u201d massively underdetermine\nthat grammar. Connectionism could support an empiricism here by\nproviding a proof-of-concept that such structured knowledge can be\nlearned from inputs available to humans using only learning mechanisms\nfound in non-classical architectures. Of course it is too soon to tell\nwhether this promise can be realized. \n",
