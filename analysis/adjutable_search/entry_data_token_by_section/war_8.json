    "main_text": "Jus ad Bellum || Legitimate Authority\n3.3 Legitimate Authority\n\nHistorically, just war theory has been dominated by statists. Most\nbranches of the tradition have had some version of a\n\u201clegitimate\u201d, \u201cproper\u201d or \u201cright\u201d\nauthority constraint, construed as a necessary condition for a war to\nbe ad bellum\n just.[12]\n In practice, this means that sovereigns and states have rights that\nnon-state actors lack. International law gives only states rights of\nnational defence and bestows \u201ccombatant rights\u201d primarily\non the soldiers of states. Although Walzer said little about\nlegitimate authority, his arguments all assume that states have a\nspecial moral standing that non-state actors lack.\n\nThe traditionalist, then, says it matters that the body fighting the\nwar have the appropriate authority to do so. Some think that authority\nis grounded in the overall legitimacy of the state. Others think that\noverall legitimacy is irrelevant\u2014what matters is whether the\nbody fighting the war is authorized to do so by the polity that it\nrepresents (Lazar forthcoming-b). Either way, states are much more\nlikely to satisfy the legitimate authority condition than non-state\nactors.\n\nRevisionists push back: relying on reductivist premises, they argue\nthat killing in war is justified by the protection of individual\nrights, and our licence to defend our rights need not be mediated\nthrough state institutions. Either we should disregard the legitimate\nauthority condition or we should see it as something that non-state\nactors can, in fact, fulfil (Fabre 2008; Finlay 2010; Schwenkenbecher\n2013).\n\nOverall, state legitimacy definitely seems relevant for some questions\nin war (Estlund 2007; Renzo 2013). But authorization is more\nfundamental. Ideally, the body fighting the war should be authorized\nto do so by the institutions of a constitutional democracy. Looser\nforms of authorization are clearly possible; even a state that is not\noverall legitimate might nonetheless be authorized by its polity to\nfight wars of national defence. \n\nAuthorization of this kind matters to jus ad bellum in two\nways. First, fighting a war without authorization constitutes an\nadditional wrong, which has to be weighed against the goods that\nfighting will bring about, and must pass the proportionality and\nnecessity tests. When a government involves its polity in a war, it\nuses the resources of the community at large, as well as its name, and\nexposes it to both moral and prudential risks (Lazar forthcoming-b).\nDoing this unauthorized is obviously deeply morally problematic. Any\nform of undemocratic decision-making by governments is objectionable;\ntaking decisions of this magnitude without the population\u2019s\ngranting you the right to do so is especially wrong.\n\nSecond, authorization can allow the government to act on positive\nreasons for fighting that would otherwise be unavailable. Consider the\nclaim that wars of national defence are in part justified by the\npolitical interests of the citizens of the defending\nstate\u2014interests, for example, in democratic participation or in\ncollective self-determination. A government may defend these\naggregated political interests only if it is authorized to do so.\nOtherwise fighting would contravene the very interests in\nself-determination that it is supposed to protect. But if it is\nauthorized, then that additional set of reasons supports fighting.\n\nAs a result, democratic states enjoy somewhat more expansive war\nrights than non-democratic states and non-state movements. The latter\ntwo groups cannot often claim the same degree of authorization as\ndemocratic states. Although this might not vindicate the current bias\nin international law towards states, it does suggest that it\ncorresponds to something more than the naked self-interest of the\nframers of international law\u2014which were, of course, states. This\nobviously has significant implications for civil wars (see Parry\n2016).\n",
