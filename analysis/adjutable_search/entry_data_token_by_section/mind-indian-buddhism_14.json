    "main_text": "Theories of Mind || Mind and Causation\n5.1 Mind and Causation\n\n\nAs we saw above \n (\u00a72.2)\n in the dynamic process of dependently arising phenomena that \nencompass the five aggregates, cognitive awareness \n(vij\u00f1\u0101na) plays a double role: it is both the \nstream of conscious episodes that characterize the life of the mind \nand, at the same time, the principle of continuity of awareness, by \nvirtue of which some sense of identity is maintained over time (cf. \nJohansson 1979, 63f; Krizer 1999, 195f). Thus cognitive awareness \nprovides the basis for further cognitive activity, while also \nsupporting the formative karmic activities \n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) of sensation, perception, volition, \netc. that perpetuate the life cycle.\n\n\nThe double function of this cognitive awareness as a conditioned and \nconditioning factor within the overall dynamics of the five \naggregates is explained in causal terms by means of an analysis of \nthe underlying factors that play a role in the arising of each \ncognitive event. The lists of the types of causes, conditions, and \nresults in the Abhidharma discourse of causality vary only slightly \nfrom school to school. The classical Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da theory of\ncausality, for instance, explains the patterns of conditioning \nthrough the intermediary of six causes (hetu) and four types\nof conditions (pratyaya), as follows (see AKBh ad \nII 49\u201373):\n\n\nCauses\n\nconnected (samprayukta)\u2014ensure that each moment of\nmind is connected with its corresponding mental factors;\nsimultaneous (sahabh\u016b)\u2014arise to simultaneously\nproduce the same effect while also mutually interacting (such as when\na latent disposition for joy and an external cause of joy, produce a\nsucceeding moment of joy);\nhomogeneous (sabh\u0101ga)\u2014produce the experience\nof continuity or duration;\npervasive (sarvatraga)\u2014refers to ignorance about\nthe true nature of things as the primary cause of cyclical\nexistence;\nretributive (vip\u0101ka)\u2014correspond to the global\ninfluence of past karmic activity;\nefficient or instrumental (k\u0101ra\u1e47a)\u2014gives\nrise to cognitive events following the coming together of sense,\nobject, and corresponding type of cognitive awareness, such as in the\nvisual experience of a patch of color.\n\n\n\n\nConditions\n\ncausal condition (hetupratyaya)\u2014this includes all\nthe causes mentioned above except for the instrumental cause;\nhomogeneous and immediately antecedent condition\n(samanantarapratyaya)\u2014which pertains to all past and\npresent mental content;\ncognitive support condition\n(\u0101lambanapratyaya)\u2014this can be any mental object\nor mental factor;\npredominant factor condition\n(adhipatipratyaya)\u2014this refers only to the instrumental\ncause.\n\n\n\nDetailed accounts of causality such as this are usually followed by\nlengthy debates about the precise nature and role of these patterns of\nconditioning. For instance, on the model of the homogeneous and\nimmediately antecedent condition (no. 2 above) a particular dharma\nconditions that arising of a dharma of a similar type: a moment of\njoy, therefore, may only give rise to another moment of joy. What this\nmodel cannot explain is how karmic maturation can arise from causes\nthat are different, especially when the fruit of karmic activity is\nnot the result of immediately preceding causes but of a heterogeneous\nand temporally distant causal chain (see Waldron 2003, 65\nand passim). It is precisely this sort of issues that\nprecipitated the development of notions such as the mind-continuum\n(citta-santana) and receptacle consciousness\n(\u0101laya-vij\u00f1\u0101na). More to the point, Abhidharma\nphilosophers were pressed to counter the possibility that latent\ndispositions could persist in an unexplained way in the mental stream\nso that even skillful thoughts, for instance of generosity or\nloving-kindness, could not be free of them. The alternative scenario,\nin which the causal chain might be interrupted by a single thought,\nfor instance of enlightenment, is no less puzzling: such an\ninterruption could bring about sudden enlightenment.\n\n\nIncidentally, developments in Chinese Buddhist thought linked with \nthe Platform S\u016btra would arrive at precisely such a \nconclusion: that enlightenment is not a gradual but an instantaneous \nprocess. Thus, advocates of the gradual path of cultivation (Skt. \nbh\u0101van\u0101-krama, Chinese chien) would \nhenceforth debate proponents of sudden enlightenment (Skt. \nyugapat, Chinese tun-wu) such as we find, for \ninstance, in the Great Debate of Lhasa (ca. 792) between the Chinese \nand Korean Ho-shangs teachers and the highly scholastic Indian \ntradition of Yog\u0101c\u0101ra-M\u0101dhyamaka represented by \n\u015a\u0101ntarak\u1e63ita and his disciple Kamala\u015b\u012bla \n(see Demi\u00e9ville 1947, 1952, Gomez 1987, Lai 1987, McRae 1987, \nGregory 1987, Ruegg 1989).\n",
