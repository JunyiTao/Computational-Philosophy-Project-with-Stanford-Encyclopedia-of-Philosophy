    "main_text": "Free Will and the Problem of Causal Determinism || Determinism and Sourcehood\n1.2 Determinism and Sourcehood\n\nThere is a second conception of the sort of control that might be\nnecessary for morally responsible agency. This conception starts with\nthe observation that an agent\u2019s control seems to consist in her\nplaying a crucial role in the production of her actions. Think in\nterms of the transparent difference between those events that are\nproducts of one\u2019s agency and those that are merely\nbodily happenings. For instance, consider the choice to pick up a cup\nof coffee as opposed to the event of one\u2019s heart beating or\none\u2019s blood circulating. In the latter cases, one recognizes\nevents happening to one; in the former, one is the source and producer\nof that happening. On this model of human agency, control is\nunderstood in terms of being the source of one\u2019s actions.\n\nFixing just upon this conception of agency, how might determinism pose\na threat to free will? If determinism is true, then what happened in\nthe distant past, when combined with the laws of nature, is causally\nsufficient for the production of every human action. But if this is\nso, then, while it might be true that an agent herself is crucially\ninvolved in the production of her action, that action actually has its\nsource in causal antecedent that originate outside of her.\nHence, she, as an agent, is not the ultimate source of her\nactions.\n\nWhat is meant here by an ultimate source, and not just a source? An\nagent is an ultimate source of her action only if, at the very least,\nsomething necessary for her action originates within the agent\nherself. It cannot be located in places and times prior to the\nagent\u2019s freely willing her action. If an agent is not the\nultimate source of her actions, then her actions do not originate in\nher, and if her actions are the outcomes of conditions guaranteeing\nthem, how can she be said to control them? The conditions sufficient\nfor their occurrence were already in place long before she even\nexisted!\n\nHere is an incompatibilist argument that codifies the considerations\nset out above:\n\nAny agent, x, performs an any act, a, of her own\nfree will iff x has control over a.\nx has control over a only if x is the\nultimate source of a.\nIf x is the ultimate source of a, then some\ncondition, b, necessary for a, originates with\nx.\nIf any condition, b, originates with x, then\nthere are no conditions sufficient for b independent of\nx.\nIf determinism is true, then the facts of the past, in conjunction\nwith the laws of nature, entail every truth about the future.\nIf the facts of the past, in conjunction with the laws of nature,\nentail every truth about the future, then for any condition,\nb, necessary for any action, a, performed by any\nagent, x, there are conditions independent of x (in\nx\u2019s remote past, before x\u2019s birth) that\nare sufficient for b.\nIf, for any condition, b, necessary for any action,\na, performed by any agent, x, there are conditions\nindependent of x that are sufficient for b, then no\nagent, x, is the ultimate source of any action, a.\n(This follows from C and D.)\nIf determinism is true, then no agent, x, is the ultimate\nsource of any action, a. (This follows from E, F, and\nG.)\nTherefore, if determinism is true, then no agent, x,\nperforms any action, a, of her own free will. (This follows\nfrom A, B, and H.)\n\n\nFor ease of reference and discussion throughout this entry, let us\nsimplify the above argument as follows:\n\nA person acts of her own free will only if she is its ultimate\nsource. (A \u2013 B)\nIf determinism is true, no one is the ultimate source of her\nactions. (C \u2013 H)\nTherefore, if determinism is true, no one acts of her own free\nwill (I).\n\n\nCall this simplified argument the Source Incompatibilist\nArgument. It is important to see that the demand for alternative\npossibilities is not (at least not obviously) relevant to this\nincompatibilist argument. Suppose that a putatively freely willing\nagent had access to the relevant sort of alternative possibilities.\nAccording to the Source Incompatibilist Argument, a further\ncondition is that she must have been the ultimate source of her freely\nwilled actions. That is, the sourcehood theorist denies that\nalternative possibilities are enough to guarantee freedom.\n",
