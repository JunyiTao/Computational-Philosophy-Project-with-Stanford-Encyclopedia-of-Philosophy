    "main_text": "\n\nSusan Stebbing was a leading figure in British philosophy between the\nFirst and Second World Wars. She made significant contributions to the\ndevelopment of the analytic tradition, both in establishing it\ninstitutionally and in showing how its ideas and techniques could be\napplied in a wide range of domains. Her early work focused on logic\nand during her lifetime she was celebrated chiefly for A Modern\nIntroduction to Logic (1930), which offered an account of both\ntraditional, Aristotelian logic and the new mathematical logic\nassociated particularly with the work of Russell and Whitehead. She\nwent on to be both an important proponent of what came to be known as\nthe Cambridge School of Analysis and an advocate of the relevance of\nlogic to everyday questions and problems. In her early work on logic\nand increasingly in her later work on thinking and reasoning, she\nstressed the ways in which language is used and misused in ordinary\ncommunication and argued that philosophers must pay heed to these uses\nand misuses. Stebbing felt increasingly compelled to engage with\npractical contemporary issues and to address a wider public audience.\nPhilosophy and the Physicists (1937) and Thinking to Some\nPurpose (1939) offer, respectively, critiques of the language\nused in popular science communication and in everyday genres such as\npolitical speeches, advertisements, and newspaper editorials. Towards\nthe end of her life, her interests in logic and language became\nincreasingly socially directed and politically engaged.\nStebbing\u2019s work foreshadowed a number of important subsequent\ndevelopments both in philosophy itself and in linguistics.\n",
