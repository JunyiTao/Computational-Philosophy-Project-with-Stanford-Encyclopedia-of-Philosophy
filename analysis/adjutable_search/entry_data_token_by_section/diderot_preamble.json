    "main_text": "\n\nBecause of his public leadership of the philosophe party in\neighteenth-century France, Voltaire stands today as the iconic example\nof the French Enlightenment philosopher. Denis Diderot\n(1713\u20131784) is often seen as Voltaire\u2019s second in that\nrole since it was around both men that the Enlightenment\nphilosophes rallied as a movement after 1750. The epochal\nproject, which Diderot jointly pursued with Jean le Rond\nD\u2019Alembert, to \u201cchange the common way of thinking\u201d\nthrough a comprehensive Encyclopedia, or Reasoned Dictionary of\nthe Arts, Sciences, and Trades provided the emergent\nphilosophe movement with the cause around which they would\ncoalesce. Diderot also fought vigorously with Voltaire on behalf of\nthe Encyclop\u00e9die project and its principles, becoming\nas a result a public leader of the Enlightenment philosophical party\nin France alongside Voltaire. He also worked, like Voltaire, as a\nwriter and critical intellectual who willingly positioned himself\nagainst the grain of established authority, and one who used\nphilosophy as a vehicle for political and social activism. Yet\nDiderot\u2019s philosophy pursued many more agendas and dimensions\nthan Voltaire\u2019s. He also left behind a corpus of philosophical\nwritings that marks him out as arguably the most sophisticated of all\nthe Enlightenment philosophes, and as one of the great\nphilosophical thinkers of the eighteenth-century.\n\nDespite the obvious sophistication of Diderot\u2019s philosophy, his\nlegacy has suffered because of the historical differences separating\nhis writings from the discipline of philosophy as it is practiced\ntoday. Enlightenment philosophie was something very different\nfrom what professional academic philosophers mean by that term today,\nand Diderot\u2019s writings are often ignored by modern philosophers\nbecause they do not appear to be philosophy as they know it. Like many\nEnlightenment philosophes, Diderot also worked as an\nhomme de lettres first and foremost, and only as a\nphilosopher narrowly construed in certain instances. He also never\nauthored any recognizable work of \u201csystematic philosophy\u201d\nif by that term we mean writing in the vein of his contemporaries such\nas David Hume in his Treatise or Immanuel Kant in his\nCritiques.\n\nYet Diderot made important contributions to modern philosophy, and if\nthey are to be grasped, the historical differences separating his\nwriting from philosophy today must be transcended, and his eclectic\nmanner of working accepted and embraced. Diderot wrote works that we\nrecognize today as philosophy, but he also wrote a great deal more\nthan that, and the challenge presented by his eighteenth-century\nphilosophie is to see the modern philosophy contained in all\nof it. For Diderot did not simply write plays, art criticism, prose\nfictions, and highly imaginative works of literature alongside his\nwork in philosophy; he pursued philosophie through these\nostensibly literary works as well. He experimented with genres,\nincluding philosophical genres, when crafting his thought, and his\nwriting overall is redolent with a self-consciousness that makes any\neasy separation of his explicitly philosophical writings from his\nliterary work well-nigh impossible. His publishing habits were\nsimilarly complex, for as a writer who suffered personally under\ncensorship that made the traffic in illicit ideas a prosecutable\noffense in Old Regime France, Diderot often had very good reason to\nleave his work unpublished\u2014and very often did. At the same time,\ncensorship alone does not explain the peculiar mix of published and\nunpublished writings found in Diderot\u2019s oeuvre.\n\nThis historical complexity has given rise to some difficulty in\nassessing Diderot\u2019s writings according to the disciplinary canon\nof modern philosophy. Condillac, Helv\u00e9tius, and d\u2019Holbach\nare the Enlightenment philosophes most commonly studied\nwithin philosophy departments because their writings appear to conform\nbetter with conventional understandings of what philosophy should look\nlike as a genre and a linguistic idiom. By contrast, the works of\nDiderot tend to be studied only in literature or history departments.\nThis is unfortunate, for the treatment of Diderot\u2019s\nphilosophie as something different from modern philosophy has\ncut contemporary philosophers off from the work of one of the most\nsophisticated, subtle, and complex philosophical thinkers of the\neighteenth century.\n\nTo some extent, the way in which Diderot\u2019s philosophical work\nemploys different genres but also, challenges the idea of genre\nitself, has made it seem (perhaps too easily) congenial to a more\n\u201cContinental\u201d philosophical tradition, and foreign to a\nmore formally oriented \u201canalytic\u201d tradition. But that\nwould ignore Diderot\u2019s naturalistic commitments and the role the\nEncyclop\u00e9die played, e.g., in the self-image of\nphilosophers of science in the Vienna Circle. Our entry seeks to go\nbeyond such oppositions in dealing with Diderot as a philosopher.\n\nNeither perspective alone fully grasps the richness of Diderot\u2019s\ncontributions to modern philosophy, so in order to fully situate his\nphilosophie within philosophy writ large, a flexible and\nreflexive attitude regarding his writings must be adopted. Every text\nin Diderot\u2019s oeuvre needs to be treated as a participant in both\nhis philosophie and his philosophical work, and our\nconventional understanding of the boundaries isolating art and\nliterature from science and philosophy also needs to be suspended\nbecause very often these modern distinctions do not apply in\nDiderot\u2019s case. He also manifests an awareness of the new and\nemergent disciplinary taxonomy arising at the time, targeting his\nphilosophie on many occasions at an interrogation of these\ndeveloping epistemological divisions. This reflexivity often makes his\nthought even more relevant today than it was when it was written.\n\nTo capture the complexity of Diderot\u2019s philosophie as\nphilosophy, this article adopts this reflexive approach. It will\nproceed in two parts. An overview of Diderot\u2019s life and major\ntexts is offered in Part I so as to present his work and writings as\nparticular episodes in a coherent eighteenth-century life and career.\nTo simplify the reading of this biography, the text is offered in a\ntwo-level presentation. A short overview of the highlights of\nDiderot\u2019s life and work is offered in Section 1 to give readers\na schematic overview, but a more extensive presentation of his\nbiography is available in the\n Biographical Supplement.\n A comprehensive analysis of Diderot\u2019s major philosophical\npreoccupations as revealed in his writings is then offered in Section\n2 so as to outline the contours of Diderot\u2019s place within\nEnlightenment philosophie and modern philosophy overall. This\nis followed by brief concluding remarks in Section 3.\n",
