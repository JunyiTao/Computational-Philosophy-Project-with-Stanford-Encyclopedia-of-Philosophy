    "main_text": "Animalism and Brute-Physical Views\n8. Wider Themes\n\nThe debate between psychological-continuity and brute-physical views\ncannot be settled without considering more general matters outside of\npersonal identity. For instance, psychological-continuity theorists\nneed to explain why human organisms are unable to think as we do. This\nwill require an account of the nature of mental properties. Or if\nhuman organisms can think, psychological-continuity theorists\nwill want an account of how we can know that we are not those\norganisms. This will turn on how the reference of personal pronouns\nand proper names works, or on the nature of knowledge.\n\nSome general metaphysical views suggest that there is no unique right\nanswer to the persistence question. The best-known example is the\nontology of temporal parts mentioned in section 5. It says that for\nevery period of time when you exist, short or long, there is a\ntemporal part of you that exists only then. This gives us many likely\ncandidates for being you\u2014that is, many different beings now\nsitting there and reading this. Suppose you are a material thing, and\nthat we know what determines your spatial boundaries. That should tell\nus what counts as your current temporal part or\n\u201cstage\u201d\u2014the temporal part of you located now and at\nno other time. But that stage is a part of a vast number of temporally\nextended objects (Hudson 2001: ch. 4).\n\nFor instance, it is a part of a being whose temporal boundaries are\ndetermined by relations of psychological continuity (Section 4) among\nits stages. That is, one of the beings thinking your current thoughts\nis an aggregate of person-stages, each of which is psychologically\ncontinuous with each of the others and with no other stage. If this is\nwhat you are, then you persist by virtue of psychological continuity.\nYour current stage is also a part of a being whose temporal boundaries\nare determined by relations of psychological connectedness.\nThat is, one of the beings now thinking your thoughts is an aggregate\nof person-stages, each of which is psychologically connected with each\nof the others and to no other stage. This may not be the same as the\nfirst being, as some stages may be psychologically continuous with\nyour current stage but not psychologically connected with it. If this\nis what you are, then psychological connectedness is necessary and\nsufficient for you to persist (Lewis 1976). What\u2019s more, your\ncurrent stage is a part of an organism, which persists by virtue of\nbrute-physical continuity, and a part of many bizarre and\ngerrymandered objects (Hirsch 1982, ch. 10). Some even say that you\nare your current stage itself (Sider 2001a, 188\u2013208). And there\nwould be many other candidates.\n\nThe temporal-parts ontology implies that each of us shares our current\nthoughts with countless beings that diverge from one another in the\npast or future. If this were true, which of these things should\nwe be? Of course, we are the things we refer to when we say\n\u2018I\u2019, or more generally the referents of our personal\npronouns and proper names. But these words would be unlikely to\nsucceed in referring to just one sort of thing\u2014to only one of\nthe many candidates on each occasion of utterance. There would\nprobably be some indeterminacy of reference, so that each such\nutterance referred ambiguously to many different candidates. That\nwould make it indeterminate what things, and even what sort of things,\nwe are. And insofar as the candidates have different histories and\ndifferent persistence conditions, it would be indeterminate when we\ncame into being and what it takes for us to persist (Sider 2001b).\n",
