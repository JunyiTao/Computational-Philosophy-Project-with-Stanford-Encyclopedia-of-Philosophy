    "main_text": "Specific Theories of Consciousness || Narrative Interpretative Theories\n9.4 Narrative Interpretative Theories \n\nSome theories of consciousness stress the interpretative nature of\nfacts about consciousness.  According to such views, what is or is not\nconscious is not always a determinate fact, or at least not so\nindependent of a larger context of interpretative judgments.  The most\nprominent philosophical example is the Multiple Drafts Model (MDM) of\nconsciousness, advanced by Daniel Dennett (1991). It combines elements\nof both representationalism and higher-order theory but does so in a\nway that varies interestingly from the more standard versions of\neither providing a more interpretational and less strongly realist\nview of consciousness.\n\nThe MDM includes many distinct but interrelated features. Its name\nreflects the fact that at any given moment content fixations of many\nsorts are occurring throughout the brain. What makes some of these\ncontents conscious is not that they occur in a privileged spatial or\nfunctional location\u2014the so called \u201cCartesian\nTheater\u201d\u2014nor in a special mode or format, all of which the\nMDM denies. Rather it a matter of what Dennett calls \u201ccerebral\ncelebrity\u201d, i.e., the degree to which a given content influences\nthe future development of other contents throughout the brain,\nespecially with regard to how those effects are manifest in the\nreports and behaviors that the person makes in response to various\nprobes that might indicate her conscious state. One of the MDM's key\nclaims is that different probes (e. g., being asked different\nquestions or being in different contexts that make differing\nbehavioral demands) may elicit different answers about the person's\nconscious state. Moreover, according to the MDM there may be no\nprobe-independent fact of the matter about what the person's conscious\nstate really was. Hence the \u201cmultiple\u201d of the Multiple\nDrafts Model.\n\nThe MDM is representationalist in that it analyzes consciousness in\nterms of content relations. It also denies the existence of qualia and\nthus rejects any attempt to distinguish conscious states from\nnonconscious states by their presence. It rejects as well the notion\nof the self as an inner observer, whether located in the Cartesian\nTheater or elsewhere. The MDM treats the self as an emergent or\nvirtual aspect of the coherent roughly serially narrative that is\nconstructed through the interactive play of contents in the\nsystem. Many of those contents are bound together at the intentional\nlevel as perceptions or fixations from a relatively unified and\ntemporally extended point of view, i.e., they cohere in their contents\nas if they were the experiences of a ongoing self. But it is the order\nof dependence that is crucial to the MDM account. The relevant\ncontents are not unified because they are all observed by a single\nself, but just the converse. It is because they are unified and\ncoherent at the level of content that they count as the experiences of\na single self, at least of a single virtual self.\n\nIt is in this respect that the MDM shares some elements with\nhigher-order theories. The contents that compose the serial narrative\nare at least implicitly those of an ongoing if virtual self, and it is\nthey that are most likely to be expressed in the reports the person\nmakes of her conscious state in response to various probes. They thus\ninvolve a certain degree of reflexivity or self-awareness of the sort\nthat is central to higher-order theories, but the higher-order aspect\nis more an implicit feature of the stream of contents rather than\npresent in distinct explicit higher-order states of the sort found in\nstandard HO theories.\n\nDennett's MDM has been highly influential but has also drawn\ncriticism, especially from those who find it insufficiently realist in\nits view of consciousness and at best incomplete in achieving its\nstated goal to fully explain it (Block 1994, Dretske 1994, Levine\n1994). Many of its critics acknowledge the insight and value of the\nMDM, but deny that there are no real facts of consciousness other than\nthose captured by it (Rosenthal 1994, Van Gulick 1994, Akins\n1996).\n\nFrom a more empirical perspective, the neuroscientist Michael\nGazzaniga (2011) has introduced the idea of an \u201cinterpreter\nmodule\u201d based in the left hemisphere that makes sense of our\nactions in any inferential way and constructs an ongoing narrative of\nour actions and experience.  Though the theory is not intended as a\ncomplete theory of consciousness, it accords a major role to such\ninterpretative narrative activity.\n",
