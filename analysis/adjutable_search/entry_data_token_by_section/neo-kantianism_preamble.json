    "main_text": "\n\nNeo-Kantianism was the dominant philosophical movement in Germany from\nroughly 1870 until the First World War. This movement drew inspiration\nfrom a diverse cast of philosophers\u2014principally, Kuno Fischer\n(Fischer 1860), Hermann von Helmholtz (Helmholtz 1867, 1878),\nFriedrich Lange (Lange 1866), Otto Liebmann (Liebmann 1865), and\nEduard Zeller (Zeller 1862))\u2014who in the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury were calling for a return to Kant\u2019s philosophy as an\nalternative to both speculative metaphysics and materialism (Beiser\n2014b). During the 1870s, the movement formed into two schools, one\nbased around Hermann Cohen at Marburg University and another based in\nsouthwest Germany (in the province of Baden) around Wilhelm\nWindelband. Later members of the Marburg School include Paul Natorp\nand Ernst Cassirer; later members of the Southwest School include\nHeinrich Rickert and Emil\n Lask.[1]\n\n Neo-Kantians[2]\n were not only intellectually influential, they were also great\nsuccesses academically in Germany. They held prominent academic\nchairs, and were successful in placing their students, shaping\ncurricula, and editing important journals and books. Most of the\nGerman philosophers who came to prominence in Germany after the First\nWorld War were educated by Neo-Kantians\u2014an impressive and\ncomprehensive list of students that includes Rudolf Carnap, Hans-Georg\nGadamer, Martin Heidegger, and Hans\n Reichenbach.[3]\n But the reputation of Neo-Kantianism shifted dramatically in the\ndecades after 1918. Neo-Kantians were associated with the old\norder, and so became the primary targets of the many philosophers\n(including their own students) wanting to make a completely fresh\nstart. The subsequent geopolitical upheavals, not the least of which\nwas Hitler\u2019s rise to power in 1933, nearly erased the\ninstitutional memory of Neo-Kantianism within the emerging analytic\nand continental traditions. However, in the last few decades,\nhistorians of philosophy of all stripes have begun to re-discover both\nthe historical and philosophical significance of Neo-Kantianism.\n\nThis article has three parts. After giving an overview of the common\nfeatures of Neo-Kantians, section 2 is devoted to the Marburg School,\nand section 3 to the Southwest (SW) School. The Neo-Kantians were\nsystematic and comprehensive philosophers, writing on nearly every\narea of philosophy. Instead of attempting to cover all areas of their\nthought, this article will focus on the areas of their philosophies\nthat were most central to their thought, and that were most\ninfluential on their contemporaries and successors. Accordingly, each\nsection begins with each school\u2019s conception of philosophy\n(sections 2.1 and 3.1), moves on to their theory of knowledge (2.2 and\n3.2), and ends with the philosophy of the special sciences most\ncharacteristic of each school (2.3 on Marburg philosophy of physics,\nand 3.3 on SW philosophy of history). (Three supplementary documents\ncover philosophies of logic, psychology, and mathematics in the\nMarburg School.)\n",
