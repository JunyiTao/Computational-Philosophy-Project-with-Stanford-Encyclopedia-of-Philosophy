    "main_text": "Climate Modeling || Constructing Climate Models\n4.2 Constructing Climate Models\n\nCurrently, there are a few dozen state-of-the-art GCMs/ESMs housed at\nmodeling centers around the world (see Flato et al. 2013: Table 9.1).\nThese are huge models, in some cases involving more than a million\nlines of computer code; it takes considerable time to produce simulations\nof interest with them, even on today\u2019s supercomputers. To construct a GCM/ESM\nfrom scratch requires a vast range of knowledge and expertise (see\nLahsen 2005). Consequently, many of today\u2019s GCMs and ESMs have\nbeen built upon the foundations of earlier generations of models\n(Knutti et al. 2013). Such models often have a layered history, with\nsome parts of their code originally developed years or even decades\nago\u2014sometimes by scientists who are no longer working at the\nmodeling center\u2014and other parts just added or upgraded. Even\nmodels at different modeling centers sometimes have pieces of computer\ncode in common, whether shared directly or borrowed independently from\nan earlier model.\n\nMany of today\u2019s GCMs/ESMs have an ostensibly modular design:\nthey consist of several component models corresponding to different\nparts of the climate system\u2014atmosphere, ocean, land surface,\netc.\u2014as well as a \u201ccoupler\u201d that passes information\nbetween them where the spatial boundaries of the component systems meet and\nthat must account for any differences in the component models\u2019\nspatiotemporal resolution (Alexander & Easterbrook 2015). Often\nthese component models are modified versions of named, stand-alone\nmodels. For example, the Community Earth System Model version 1.2\n(CESM1.2) housed at the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research\nincorporates the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) and an extension of\nthe Parallel Ocean Program (POP). Such modularity is intended to allow\nfor easier reconfiguration of a GCM/ESM for different modeling\nstudies, e.g., replacing the ocean model with a simpler version when\nthis will suffice. Lenhard and Winsberg (2010), however, argue that\ncomplex climate models in fact exhibit only a \u201cfuzzy\u201d\nmodularity: in order for the model as a whole to work well, some of\nthe details of the component models will be adjusted to mesh with the\nparticular features of other components and to try to compensate for\ntheir particular limitations.\n\nEach component model in a GCM/ESM in turn incorporates representations\nof a number of important processes operating within that part of the\nclimate system. For atmosphere models, for example, it is common to\ndistinguish the \u201cdynamics\u201d and the \u201cphysics\u201d\n(see, e.g., Neale et al. 2010). The dynamics (or \u201cdynamical\ncore\u201d) is a set of fluid dynamical and thermodynamic equations\nreflecting conservation of momentum, mass and energy, as well as an\nequation of state. These equations are used to simulate large-scale\natmospheric motions, which transport heat, mass and moisture; the\nscale of the motions that can be resolved depends on the grid mesh of\nthe model. The \u201cphysics\u201d encompasses representations of\nsub-grid processes that impact grid-scale conditions in a significant\nway: radiative transfer, cloud formation, precipitation and more.\nThese processes are parameterized, i.e., represented as a\nfunction of the grid-scale variables that are calculated explicitly in\nthe dynamical core (e.g., temperature, pressure, winds, humidity).\nParameterization is necessary in other components of climate models as\nwell, whenever sub-grid processes significantly influence\nresolved-scale variables.\n\nConstructing a parameterization is akin to an engineering problem,\nwhere the goal is to find an \u201cadequate substitute\u201d (Katzav\n2013a) for the explicit simulation of a sub-grid process, using a\nlimited set of ingredients. This is a challenging task. For given\nvalues of the grid-scale variables, there are usually many possible\nrealizations of the sub-grid conditions. The standard approach to\nparameterization has been a deterministic one, aiming to estimate the\ncontribution that the sub-grid process would make on average, over\nmany possible realizations that are physically consistent with a given\nset of grid-scale conditions (McFarlane 2011). An alternative approach\ngaining popularity is stochastic parameterization,\nwhich aims to estimate the contribution made by a single,\nrandomly-selected member of the set of realizations physically\nconsistent with the grid-scale conditions (Berner et al. 2017).\nTypically, parameterizations of either type are informed by physical\nunderstanding but also incorporate elements derived at least in part\nfrom observations (see also Sundberg 2007; Guillemot 2010); this is\nwhy parameterizations are often described as\n\u201csemi-empirical\u201d. Because climate models incorporate both\naccepted physical theory and such semi-empirical, engineered elements,\nthey are sometimes described as having a hybrid\nrealist-instrumentalist status (Parker 2006; Katzav 2013a; see also\nGoodwin 2015).\n\nParameterization also gives rise to fuzzy modularity within\ncomponent models of GCMs/ESMs: which parameterizations work best with\na given climate model depends to some extent on how other sub-grid\nprocesses have already been represented and the errors that those other\nrepresentations introduce (see also Lenhard & Winsberg 2010 on\n\u201cgenerative entrenchment\u201d). Even the best-available\nparameterizations, however, usually have significant limitations.\nIndeed, uncertainty about how to adequately parameterize sub-grid\nprocesses remains a major source of uncertainty in climate modeling.\nDifferences in parameterizations\u2014especially for cloud\nprocesses\u2014account for much of the spread among simulations of\nthe climate system\u2019s response to increasing greenhouse gas\nconcentrations (Flato et al. 2013: 743). This is one motivation for a\nnew approach to parameterization: super-parameterization\ninvolves explicitly simulating a sub-grid process in a simplified way,\nby coupling a 1-D or 2-D model of the process (e.g., cloud formation)\nto each GCM/ESM grid point (Randall et al. 2013; Gramelsberger 2010).\nThis is a multi-scale modeling approach that requires significant\nadditional computing power, relative to traditional\nparameterization.\n\nConstruction of climate models also inevitably involves some\ntuning, or calibration, which involves the (often ad\nhoc) adjustment of parameter values or other elements of the model in\norder to improve model performance, usually measured by fit with\nobservations. The observations that are targeted vary from case to\ncase; they might relate to individual processes or to aggregate,\nsystem-level variables, such as global mean surface temperature (see\nMauritsen et al. 2012; Hourdin et al. 2017). Which parameter values are\nadjusted depends on the observations with which a better fit is\nsought, but often adjustments are made within parameterizations, to\nparameters whose best values are significantly\nuncertain. The extent to which a model is tuned is usually not\ndocumented or reported in detail (but see Mauritsen et al. 2012 for an\ninstructive example). Recently, there have been calls for more\ntransparency in reporting tuning strategies and targets (Hourdin et\nal. 2017), in part because information about tuning is relevant to\nmodel evaluation (see\n Section 4.4).\n An interesting question, however, is exactly what counts as tuning\nsince, even when formal quantitative comparison with a set of\nobservational data is not performed, modelers can be familiar with\nthose data and may well make choices in model\ndevelopment\u2014choices which could reasonably have been somewhat\ndifferent\u2014with the expectation that they will improve the\nmodel\u2019s performance with respect to those already-seen data.\n\nA further issue concerns the role of social and ethical values in\nclimate model construction. Winsberg (2010, 2012; Biddle &\nWinsberg 2009) argues that such values influence climate model\nconstruction (and thereby results) both by shaping priorities in model\ndevelopment and via inductive risk considerations, e.g., when deciding\nto represent a climate system process in one way rather than another,\nin order to reduce the risk that the model\u2019s results err in a\nway that would have particularly negative non-epistemic consequences.\nHe contends that social and ethical values operate in climate model\nconstruction whenever there are no decisive, purely epistemic grounds\nfor considering one model-building option to be the best available.\nParker (2014a) disputes this, pointing to the importance of pragmatic\nfactors, such as ease of implementation, local expertise and\ncomputational demands. Intemann (2015) argues that social and ethical\nvalues can legitimately influence climate model construction,\nincluding via the routes identified by Winsberg, when this promotes\ndemocratically-endorsed social and epistemic aims of research. \n",
