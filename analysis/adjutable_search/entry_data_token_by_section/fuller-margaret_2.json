    "main_text": "Major Themes in Fuller\u2019s Philosophy || Transcendentalism and Platonism\n2.2 Transcendentalism and Platonism\n\n1835 was a year when the most influential persons in Margaret\nFuller\u2019s life changed: her father Timothy died, and she made the\nacquaintance of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who became her friend and mentor.\nFuller\u2019s relationship with Emerson, like that with her father,\nwas full of tensions. The two had very discordant personalities, as\nJudith Thurman has observed: \u201cWaldo\u2019s cool, cerebral, and\nironic; Margaret\u2019s noisy, histrionic, and sincere\u201d\n(Thurman 2013: 79). Though their interactions were often tempestuous,\nEmerson converted Fuller to his own version of self-improvement: the\nquest for spiritual self-transcendence. Followers became known as\ntranscendentalists because they sought to transcend the material world\nin communion with the divine. Fuller became a member of the\nTranscendental Club founded by Emerson and Frederick Henry Hedge,\nvirtually all of whose members were Unitarians or former Unitarians.\nThe transcendentalists (including Thoreau, Theodore Parker, and\nElizabeth Peabody) are remembered today for their contributions to\nAmerican literature, philosophy, and social reform, the first\nintellectual counter-culture in American history (see the entry on\n transcendentalism).\n At Emerson\u2019s invitation, Fuller edited the transcendental\nperiodical The Dial for two years (1840\u201342) and\ncontinued to write for it afterwards. \n\nThe transcendentalists aspired to rescue the United States from\ncultural provincialism. American culture was then chiefly based on\nCalvinism and on the Enlightenment; the transcendentalists wanted to\nintroduce their country to Romanticism and the philosophy of Kant.\nFuller was strongly attracted to German Romanticism. Hence her\nambition, never realized, to write a biography of Goethe. Of the\nancient philosophers to whom her father had introduced her,\nFuller\u2019s favorite was Plato.\n\nThe American transcendentalists embraced Plato and Platonism in\ngeneral. They looked back fondly on the Platonists (more properly\ncalled Neoplatonists) of seventeenth-century Cambridge University in\nEngland. The Unitarian and transcendentalist intellectuals of\nnineteenth-century New England were aware of these Renaissance\nintellectuals and admired their reliance on individual freedom as the\nfoundation for religious faith rather than intolerant coercion. The\nCambridge Platonists rejected Calvinism and embraced a humanist form\nof Christianity focused on the proper development of human powers.\nThey not only found Plato\u2019s own philosophy congenial, but also\nthat of the third-century Alexandrian Neoplatonist named Plotinus.\nPlotinus had developed a system for self-cultivation, seeking God\nwithin one\u2019s own psyche. All of this heritage was\ninvoked in the nineteenth century by William Ellery Channing, Ralph\nWaldo Emerson, and Margaret Fuller.\n\nFuller was thoroughly conversant with Plato, but by no means his\nuncritical follower. In some of his writings, Plato was the first\nfeminist. Among the guardians of his ideal Republic a perfect\nmeritocracy prevails and women are included within the public spirit\nof the polis; they receive the same education as men and have\nequal opportunity to exercise political power. Elsewhere, however,\nPlato compromised with and even legitimated the prevailing subjugation\nof women. Fuller accordingly rendered a mixed verdict on Plato\u2019s\nphilosophy of gender (Fuller 1845: 90; also see Okin 1979:\n15\u201370). Here, as always, she used tradition as a resource\nwithout letting herself be imprisoned by it. \n\nWhere Channing and other Unitarian thinkers had been metaphysical\ndualists eager to impose the supremacy of mind over matter, Emerson\nand most transcendentalists espoused pure idealism. At least\ninitially, transcendentalism was itself a religion, and a religion\nthat rejected the relevance of empirical evidence like Scripture,\nmiracles, and the fulfillment of prophecies (see the entry on\n transcendentalism).\n\nMargaret Fuller retained the dualistic metaphysics of Channing rather\nthan the pure idealism of Emerson and her other transcendentalist\nfriends. But she followed the transcendentalist approach to the\ndistinction between \u201cReason\u201d and\n\u201cUnderstanding\u201d. What we normally regard as perception and\nlogical thinking they classified as \u201cUnderstanding\u201d.\n\u201cReason\u201d Fuller and others saw as divinely inspired\ninsight, peculiar to each individual and much more important for true\nreligion. \u201cUnderstanding\u201d carried us through the mundane,\npractical material world. \u201cReason\u201d was the faculty through\nwhich a wise person conducted the Platonic Quest to go beyond the\nmaterial in search of the ideal. Both Channing and Emerson wanted to\nrecreate in the modern world the role that had been played by the New\nEngland Puritan minister as inspirational intellectual, spiritual, and\nmoral leader. Fuller was determined to open this role to women. Even\nwhile embracing nineteenth-century Romanticism, she sought to\nimplement the Enlightenment ideal of natural rights. In this and other\nways, she stands out to us as the most modern of the New England\ntranscendentalists. \n",
