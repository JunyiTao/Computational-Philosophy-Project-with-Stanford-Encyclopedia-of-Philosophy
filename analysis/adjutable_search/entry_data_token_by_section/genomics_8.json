    "main_text": "Beyond Sequencing || Metagenomics\n3.2 Metagenomics\n\nMetagenomics (also referred to as \u2018environmental\u2019 or\n\u2018community\u2019 genomics) is a research field that aims to\nanalyse the collective genomes of microbial communities. These\ncommunities are usually extracted from environmental samples, ranging\nfrom soil to water or even air samples. A major advantage of\nmetagenomics is that it does not rely on techniques for culturing\nmicrobes. This is important because only an estimated 1%\u20135% of\nall microbes can be cultured at all (Amann et al. 1995), an issue that\nhas been referred to as the \u2018great plate count anomaly\u2019\n(Staley & Konopka\n 1985).[23]\n\nThe term \u2018metagenomics\u2019 was first coined in 1998\n(Handelsman et al. 1998). The prefix \u2018meta\u2019 in\n\u2018metagenomics\u2019 can be read in at least three different\nways (O\u2019Malley 2013): 1) As referring to the fact that\nmetagenomics transcends culturing limitations. 2) As\nemphasising the aggregate-level approach to biology that\ncharacterises metagenomics (looking beyond single entities (cells or\ngenomes)). And 3) as referring to the goal of creating an overarching\nunderstanding of the genomic diversity of the microbial realm.\n\nThe methodology of metagenomics can be described as a four step\nprocess, consisting of: 1) the collection of environmental samples, 2)\nthe isolation of microbial DNA from these samples, 3a) the direct\nanalysis of the DNA or 3b) the creation of a genomic DNA library by\nfragmentation and insertion of the sampled DNA into suitable vectors\n(for instance plasmids that can be propagated in laboratory bacterial\nstrains). These genomic libraries can then be used to 4a) sequence or\n4b) perform a functional screen of the sampled genomic DNA. As the\ndistinction between steps 4a) and 4b) already implies, metagenomics\ncan be divided into a sequence- and a function-based approach (Gabor\n2007; Sleator et al. 2008). In the former the collected DNA is\nsequenced so that potential genes present in the sample can be\nidentified and, if feasible, the genomes of all the microbes that were\npresent in the sample can be reconstituted.\n\nThe sequence-based approach is feasible due to the vastly reduced\ncosts of sequencing and the increased computing power available. The\ngoal of the approach is to get an idea of the diversity and\ndistribution of microbes present in the sample and to also get an\ninsight into their functioning (for instance by identifying\nmetabolism-related enzymes that can give clues about the metabolic\npathways active in the different microbes). This can give insights\ninto the workings of the microbial ecosystem present in the sampled\nenvironment more generally.\n\nIn the functional approach the fragments of DNA that are stored in the\nlibrary are used in what is often called a \u2018functional\nscreen\u2019. To perform such a screen the researchers introduce the\nlibrary plasmids into specific bacterial strains which then read and\nexpress any protein-coding sequence that might be present on the\nfragments, thereby producing the protein(s) the fragment codes\n for.[24]\n The key to a functional screen is to create conditions in which only\nthose bacteria that express a protein with the function of\ninterest can be singled out (for instance by making sure that\nonly those cells survive). Once the cells are singled out the library\nplasmid they contain can be recovered and sequenced allowing the\nresearcher to identify the protein(s) encoded by that fragment.\nFunctional metagenomics is often used to identify novel microbial\nproteins that can be used in biotechnological and pharmaceutical\ncontexts and it is not surprising that metagenomics was and still is\nof great interest to the biotechnological sector (Streit & Schmitz\n2004; Lorenz & Eck 2005; Culligan et al. 2014; Ekkers et al.\n2012).\n\nOne of the first actual (sequence-based) metagenomics projects was\nperformed (yet again) by one of the pioneers of genomics, Craig\nVenter. The goal of Venter and his team was to sample microbes from\nthe surface of the nutrient-poor Sargasso sea (Venter et al. 2004).\nThis particular environment was chosen for this pilot study because it\nwas expected to have a microbial community with relatively low\ndiversity. This assumption turned out to be wrong and the project\nidentified more than a million putative protein-coding sequences\nderived from at least 1800 different genomic species extracted from\nthe sea water.\n\nAnother early metagenomics study consisted of the analysis of an\nacidophilic biofilm with low microbial diversity from an acid mine\ndrain in California (Tyson et al. 2004). The analysed biofilm survives\nin one of the most extreme environments including a very low pH (i.e.,\nhigh acidity), relatively high temperature and high concentration of\nmetals. Importantly, this specific biofilm truly displays low\ncomplexity as it is composed of only three bacterial and two archaeal\nspecies. This simplicity greatly aided the analysis effort and allowed\nthe researchers an almost complete recovery of two of the genomes and\na partial recovery of the other three.\n\nThere have been many other metagenomics studies conducted since and\nthere is little point in listing them here, as the list is growing by\nthe month. One aspect of the ongoing research that is important to\npoint out, however, is that the projects are becoming increasingly\nambitious. The trend now is not just to have an integrated view on the\ngenomes but to combine metagenomics with other techniques such as\nmetabolomics (the assay of small molecules present in a system),\nmetatranscriptomics (the analysis of all RNA transcripts of a\ncommunity of microbes) and viromics (the analysis of all the viral\ngenomes present in the system of interest) (see Turnbaugh & Gordon\n2008; Bikel et al. 2015). In a sense the field is moving towards a\nhighly integrated meta-Metagenomics approach (Dupr\u00e9 &\nO\u2019Malley (2007) talk of \u201cmetaorganismal\nmetagenomics\u201d). This is also in line with the general trend\ntowards big-data and discovery-based approaches in the life sciences\n(Ankeny & Leonelli 2015; Dolinski & Troyanskaya 2015; Leonelli\n2014, 2016).\n\nThe rise of metagenomics is also linked to other changes in biological\nsciences more generally, especially the rise of systems biology\nstarting around the year 2000 (which is itself closely linked to the\ndevelopment of genomics since the 1990s). O\u2019Malley and\nDupr\u00e9 (2005) point out that there is an important distinction\nto be made when looking at fields like systems biology, because there\nis not only a change in epistemology but also one in ontology. They\ntherefore distinguish between pragmatic and systems-theoretic\nbiologists. For the former, the idea of a \u2018system\u2019 is\nmerely an epistemic tool. For the latter, the system becomes the new\nfundamental ontological unit. Doolittle and Zhaxybayeva (2010) claim\nthat the same can be seen in metagenomics where there is a drive to\nsee the community or the ecosystem as the new fundamental unit, and\nnot the single species (see also Dupr\u00e9 & O\u2019Malley\n2007).\n\nMoving away from a focus on single organisms or monogenomic species\nallows us to make better sense of many recent findings in microbiology\n(in which metagenomics has played a key role). Central to all of this\nare mobile DNA elements that can travel horizontally, meaning between\ndifferent members of a community (including between different kinds of\norganisms). Obtaining such mobile DNA elements can have a crucial\neffect on the survival and reproduction capacity of the recipient\ncell. Mobile DNA can therefore be a key element in the evolutionary\nprocesses as it becomes a \u2018communal resource\u2019 (McFall-Ngai\net al. 2013). Acquired antibiotic resistance is only one of many\nbenefits cells are known to obtain through acquired DNA elements.\n\nIt is then the composition of functional elements that the community\nas a whole contains which is preserved over evolutionary time. And the\ncommunity could be seen as an assembly of biochemical activities and\nnot of distinct microbial lineages (see for instance Turnbaugh et al.\n2009 and also Burke et al. 2011). The metagenome then becomes a\n\u2018genome of communities\u2019 and not a \u2018community of\ngenomes\u2019 (Doolittle & Zhaxybayeva 2010). All of this also\nfeeds into the more general, and currently very active, discussion\nabout the problem of individuality in biology (Clarke 2010; Bouchard\n& Huneman 2013; Ereshefsky & Pedroso 2013; Guay & Pradeu\n2015; SEP entry on\n the biological notion of individual).\n\nApart from these issues in biological ontology, there are also\nepistemological issues raised by metagenomics, namely the discrepancy\nbetween our ability to sequence DNA and to interpret it. These\ndiscussions about the challenges of DNA sequence interpretation are\nnot just a problem for (meta)genomics and other -omics approaches, but\nalso for biomedicine more generally and its push towards a truly\npersonalised medicine. A key issue for this push is the discrepancy\nbetween the (ever-decreasing) costs of obtaining a personal genome\nsequence (Bennett et al. 2005; Mardis 2006; Check 2014a,b) and the\nhigh costs of making sure the data can be appropriately interpreted\n(Mardis 2006; Sboner et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2015). This problem\nis related to the so-called \u2018bioinformatic bottleneck\u2019,\nthe handling and the interpretation of the large amounts of sequence\ndata that provides the main obstacle to progress (Green et al. 2011;\nDesai et al. 2012; Scholz et al. 2012; Marx 2013). In the days of\nnext-generation sequencing the sequencing step itself is no longer the\nrate-limiting step.\n",
