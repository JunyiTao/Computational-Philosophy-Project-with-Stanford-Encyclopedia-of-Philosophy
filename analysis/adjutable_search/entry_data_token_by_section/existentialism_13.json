    "main_text": "Authenticity || Nietzsche\u2019s Overman\n5.3 Nietzsche\u2019s Overman\nLike Kierkegaard, Nietzsche is critical of our tendency to follow\nthe herd and cling to universal moral principles. He forwards a\nconception of authenticity that accepts our nihilistic predicament and\nrises above Christian values of good and evil. He sees these values as\nrepresentative of a tame and submissive way of being, a \u201cslave\nmorality\u201d (Sklavenmoral) that is subservient to\nauthority and bereft of any originality or style. Nietzsche contrasts\nthis with a \u201cmaster morality\u201d (Herrenmoral)\nembodied in those who have the courage to face, even affirm, the cruel\nand tragic aspects of life and the self-directed power to create their\nown meanings and values against the backdrop of God\u2019s death.\nNietzsche refers to the individual who can overcome the meek and\nslavish values of tradition for the sake of self-creation as an\n\u201cOverman\u201d (\u00dcbermensch), an aristocratic\nfigure who embodies the freedom, courage, and strength to be original,\nthat is, to \u201cgive style\u201d to life. \u201cSuch\nspirits,\u201d writes Nietzsche, \u201care always out of fashion or\nexplain themselves and their surroundings as free\nnature\u2014wild, arbitrary, fantastic, and surprising\u201d (1887\n[1974], \u00a7290).\nThe key to living with style is, for Nietzsche, a radical\nacceptance of one\u2019s existence and the world as it is,\nembracing all our strengths and weaknesses and all the blessed and\ncursed events that have been and will be. The Overman is a\n\u201cyes-sayer\u201d who affirms every aspect of his life,\n\u201cevery truth, even the simple, bitter, ugly, unchristian, immoral\ntruths\u201d (1887 [1996], \u00a71). In The Gay Science,\nNietzsche captures this attitude with a famous thought experiment\ncalled the \u201cdoctrine of eternal recurrence.\u201d Here, he asks\nif we have the audacity to live the same life we are living now over\nand over for eternity. \u201cAnd there will be nothing new about\nit,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut every pain and every pleasure, and\nevery thought and sigh, and everything unspeakably small and great in\nyour life must come back to you and all in the same series and\nsequence.\u201d On Nietzsche\u2019s view, most of us would recoil in\nhorror at the prospect of eternally suffering through the same boredom,\nfailures, and disappointments. But overflowing with amor fati\n(love of one\u2019s fate), the Overman welcomes this possibility,\nproclaiming, \u201cI have never heard anything more godlike\u201d\n(1887 [1974], \u00a7341). Camus describes this attitude as a form of\nrebellion against servile and conformist ways of being. Like the\nOverman, \u201cthe rebel\u201d is someone \u201cborn of abundance\nand fullness of spirit,\u201d and he embodies \u201cthe unreserved\naffirmation of human imperfection and suffering, of evil and murder, of\nall that is problematic and strange in our existence. It is born of an\narrested wish to be what one is in a world that is what it is\u201d (1951\n[1956, 72]).\nBut not everyone has the inborn power to rebel against tradition\nand creatively express their unique style of living. For Nietzsche,\nonly \u201cthe highest types\u201d can manifest this kind of freedom\nand capacity for self-overcoming. To this end, his account of\nauthenticity is unapologetically elitist and anti-democratic. Most of\nus are too mired in self-deception, too frightened and weak to break\nwith the herd and become who we are. \u201cOnly a very few people can\nbe free,\u201d writes Nietzsche, \u201cIt is a prerogative of the\nstrong\u201d (1886 [1998], \u00a729). \n",
