    "main_text": "Stuff as a Special Kind of Thing or Things || Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Mereological Sums\n2.1 Concrete Mass Expressions Refer to Mereological Sums\n\nIn the various sum-theoretical analyses of mass expressions\n(Cartwright 1965, 1979b; Burge 1977; Moravcsik 1973), all mass\nexpressions with their non-count features disappear upon analysis and\nare replaced by talk of sums.\n\nThese accounts can get quite technical, but the basic idea is\nrelatively easy to understand. Since, on these accounts, concrete mass\nexpressions refer to mereological sums, a sentence such as \u201cSnow\nis white\u201d is understood to mean that there is a sum of all the\nsnow (flakes, bits, balls, etc.), and that this sum is part of the\nfusion of all the white things (Quine 1960, ch. 20). A sentence such\nas \u201cThe water is in the tub\u201d gets cashed out to mean that\nthere is a fusion of water molecules which is in the tub. While there\nare many permutations on this strategy, sum theorists will, whenever\npossible, paraphrase away talk of stuffs and talk instead of sums,\nwhere sums satisfy the constraints of Thinghood and do not\ncontradict Thing Theory (TT) as outlined in\n 1.1.\n\nThere are many possible positions for those who wish to analyze mass\nexpressions in terms of sums. What follows is a short survey of some\nof the most salient decision points one must confront in constructing\na detailed view of this kind, and what problems emerge from deciding\none way or another.\n2.1.1 Which Sums of Stuff Are There?\n\nIn the literature on material objects, an oft-discussed question is:\nwhen do two or more things compose a further thing (van Inwagen 1990)?\nSome common answers are\u2014never (Compositional\nNihilism\u2014Unger 1979, Dorr and Rosen 2002); always\n(Mereological Universalism\u2014Lewis 1986, pp.\u2009212\u2013213;\nRea 1998); only when they form a life (Organicism\u2014van\nInwagen 1990; Merricks 2001); whenever the candidate fusion has\nnon-redundant causal powers (Merricks 2001); whenever (and\nonly whenever) we intuitively think they do\n(Intuitivism\u2014Commonsense); or that composition is a brute\nfact (Brutalism\u2014Markosian 1998b). And the answers have\n proliferated.[15]\n\nThe most commonly held view is Mereological Universalism, or\n\u2018Unrestricted Mereology\u2019 (\u2018UM\u2019 for short). Two\nor more things always have a fusion. For example, the Empire State\nBuilding and the Dalai Lama compose an object.\n\nThe debates about composition largely focus on the fusion of\nobjects\u2014but what of matter? A strong case can be made for what\nwe could call the Unrestricted Fusion of Matter principle:\n\n(UFM):\nIf there is some matter and some distinct matter, then there is a\nsum of all of it. (cf. Markosian 2004, p.\u2009410)\n\n\nThere are several ways to argue for this. Here\u2019s one:\n\nFor any two masses of stuff K, they compose a further\nmass of K. (Summativity)\nMatter is the most general material stuff kind.\n(Generality)\nSo, any two or more masses of matter whatsoever compose a mass of\nmatter. (cf. Zimmerman 1995, section 5, Tanksley 2010)\n\n\nSummativity is a plausible principle. We believe that we\nrefer when we say things like \u2018the water in your bottle\u2019.\nNow, if you keep half of the water in your bottle, and pour half in\nLarry\u2019s empty bottle, and Larry drives off with his bottle, does\nthe water still exist? Supposing that none of the water is destroyed,\nthe answer seems to be clearly\n \u2018yes\u2019.[16]\n\nNow, if this is so, and some water can exist while being spread out,\nwhy suppose that that very same water came into existence only when\npoured into your cup (from, say, two bottles)? It seems like it could\ncome into existence when joined only if it went out of existence when\nscattered. But it didn\u2019t go out of existence when\nscattered\u2014so it couldn\u2019t have come into existence when\njoined. So, there always was this water fusion (at least as long as\nall the sub-portions of water existed). We can repeat the same\nargument for the copper in two distinct statues. There will also be\nthe sum of the gold in Sweden and the lead in Tanzania, if we can\nreplace the K in Summativity with \u2018metal\u2019.\n\nAnd it also seems true that matter is a genuine kind term,\nand the most general one there is for concrete stuffs. If it\nwasn\u2019t, it is hard to see how scientists could speak, as they\ndo, about universal properties of matter, or what kinds of matter\nthere are, or how philosophers could contrast matter with allegedly\nnon-physical minds, abstract objects, and so forth.\n\nSo, it seems that any two portions of matter whatsoever have a fusion.\nAccepting this result leads to acceptance of \u2018Mere\nSums,\u2019 i.e.,\n\n\u2018Mere Sum\u2019: A composite object whose only existence\ncondition is the existence of its (fundamental) parts, and only\npersistence condition is the persistence of all of the same ultimate\nparts. A mere sum\u2019s parts need not be cohesive, spatially close,\nor exhibit any kind of functional unity, and the sum need not be\nsolid, macroscopic, or fall under any commonsense or scientific kind\nterm. Even if it does have these features, they are inessential to its\n existence.[17]\n\n\nIt has proven extremely tempting to identify matter with Mere Sums\n(and their ultimate parts) in the mereologist\u2019s sense, which\nunrestricted mereology holds of, for the reasons just\n outlined.[18]\n\nOf course, if sums are object-like, and one has reason to believe that\nthe only objects are ones with structured essences, then one would\nhave reason to reject Summativity and UFM which lead to the posit of\nunstructured Mere Sums. (Generality seems harder to reject). Arguments\nagainst these principles can be found in sections\n 2.3\n and\n 3.1.\n (See also Laycock 1972, pp.\u20094\u20135; 2006a, Appendix\nIII).\n2.1.2 Can Sums Change Their Parts?\n\nAnother crucial decision point in developing a sum theory of the\nreferents of mass expressions is deciding whether the elements in the\nsum (e.g., the H2O molecules in some water, the gold atoms\nin some gold) are essential to the sum. The case of the most general\nkind, masses of matter, is a particularly important instance\nof this question.\n\nIt seems intuitively obvious that when one takes a sip of water, or\nadds a bit of water to a glass of water, that one does not have in the\nglass precisely the same water both before and after. Even if the same\namount of water from a different batch replaces the water\nwhich was taken away, we still would not have the same exact water\nbefore us after the replacement. And, if we perform electrolysis on a\nbatch of water but preserve any matter from being lost we can rightly\nsay we have all the same matter as we did before, just not the same\nwater, since there is none. We can construct similar examples for any\ntype of matter. What can explain and unify these obvious intuitions is\nthat there is a most general category of entity\u2014masses of\nmatter, where all the fundamental parts of any\nmass are essential to it. Such masses of matter cannot change parts\nwhatsoever.\n\nThe existence of entities like this could easily explain why there is\nnot precisely the same water through these changes. An unqualified\nview of this kind would be that nothing whatsoever can change\nparts\u2014this is called \u2018Mereological Essentialism.\u2019\nMore restricted views hold that at the very least masses of matter\ncannot change parts. Mereological essentialism has been an extremely\npopular approach throughout history. (Abelard, Reid, Bishop Butler,\nLocke, Hume, and Leibniz were all mereological essentialists of some\nkind.)\n\nThere is much to say in favor of the following principle of\nMereological Essentialism for Masses (of matter) in general (for early\ndiscussion of Mereological Essentialism under that name, see Chisholm\n1973, 1975; Plantinga 1975):\n\n(MEM)\nFor any mass of matter M and any mass of matter\nx, if x is ever a part of M, M\nwill exist only when x exists and is a part of\nM.\n\n\nWe can argue for a principle like this by first stating that masses of\nmatter at a time are individuated by having the same parts, and then\narguing that no mass can change parts over time.\n\nOur more restricted \u2018Mereological Essentialism for Masses\u2019\n(MEM) seems prima facie consistent with allowing ordinary\nobjects to change parts. MEM seems less controversial than\n\u2018Mereological Essentialism for Objects\u2019 (MEO). MEM seems\nlike something of a truism, and perhaps part of the nature of the\ncategory of matter. But let us turn to an argument for MEM on the\nassumption that there are Mere Sums.\n\nAt a time, it is easy to distinguish and identify masses,\nwhich in this context are considered Mere Sums. Assume a toy model of\na world with only 20 simples, each given a unique number from\n1\u201320 as a name. By UFM, 1\u20134 will fuse at \\(t_1.\\) Let us\ncall that sum \u2018Quadri.\u2019 Quadri will be distinct from any\nsums with distinct parts, since no sum can have different parts from\nitself at a time. Will Quadri be identical with anything\n\u2018else\u2019 composed of the same fundamental parts? Suppose 1\nis an electron, and 2\u20134 are quarks. Suppose 1\u20134 compose a\nhydrogen atom at \\(t_1.\\) Call the atom \u2018Hydro\u2019. By the\ndefinition of Mere Sums, Quadri\u2019s parts\u2019 proximity to each\nother is irrelevant to its persisting, but not so for Hydro, which, if\nit loses its electron, will cease to exist as hydrogen. (The lone\nproton is a cation of the hydron variety). So Hydro cannot be a Mere\nSum. The same will go for any putative object composed of\n1\u20134 which do not have the same persistence conditions as Quadri.\nAnd so any fusion resulting in a Mere Sum of 1\u20134 is\nQuadri; and 1\u20134 compose no other Mere Sums than Quadri. And so\nsomething is Quadri at \\(t_1\\) if and only if it has all and only\n1\u20134 as parts at that time. And so all those parts are essential\nto it at that\n time.[19]\n\nOne can make a further case that sums\u2019 parts are essential to\nthem over time. Suppose that simples 1\u20139 exist at\n\\(t_1.\\) Assuming UFM, then 1\u20139 fuse to give us the sum \\(S\\).\nAt \\(t_1,\\) also by UFM, there is the fusion of 1\u20138, which we\ncan call S\u2212. Since S\u2212 and S\nhave different parts, by\n Leibniz\u2019s Law,\n they are distinct. If a sum could lose a part and persist, then it\ncould be possible for the fusion S to come to be made up of\ndifferent parts. Suppose that only part 9 is destroyed. If MEM is\nfalse, then S could come to be composed of exactly what\nS\u2212 is. So, if MEM is false, either (i) S became\nS\u2212, (ii) S\u2212 went\nout of existence, or (iii)\nS and S\u2212 coincide as distinct sums. But, (i)\ncannot be true: two things cannot become one (although this has been\nchallenged, see Gallois 1998); (ii) cannot be true\u2014how can a\nmere mass of matter go out of existence without undergoing any\nintrinsic change? (for challenges to this see Burke 1994, Markosian\n1998a and 2004); (iii) violates a very clear intuition\u2014if you\nhave some stuff, and take some of it away, then you do not have the\nvery same stuff (cf. Jubien 1993 pp. 18\u201319). So (iii) is false.\nBut then all of (i)\u2013(iii) are false. And so MEM is true. (For\nanother challenge to an argument like the foregoing, see van Inwagen\n2009.)\n\nSo, if there can be mere sums, and UFM is true, then we ought\nto believe in MEM, even if we do not accept MEO. (Arguments against\nMEM can be found in the supplement\n Challenges to Mereological Essentialism for Masses\n and arguments against UFM in section\n 3.1.)\n2.1.3 How do Sums of Stuff Relate to Ordinary Objects?\n\nOf course, if ordinary objects can change parts, but sums can not,\nthen it seems that ordinary objects are not mereological sums. But\nthen, what are they, and how do they relate to the sums which\nobviously seem to constitute them?\n\nIf one is serious about the existence of sums of matter, it seems\nthere are only a few ways they could relate to ordinary\n objects.[20]\n One way is to say that sums constitute ordinary objects by\ncoinciding with them. That is, sums are distinct objects\nwhich share all of their parts with the commonsense objects they make\nup. One could also eliminate ordinary objects. Ordinary\nobjects either do not exist, or exist in some kind of shadowy or\nderivative sense (think of \u2018the average man\u2019). Another way\nis to say that while sums are in fact things or objects, ordinary\nobjects are a different kind of entity. These dual-category\nviews hold that commonsense objects are in a different ontological\ncategory than sums.\n\nThose who wish to explore in more detail the metaphysics of masses,\nordinary objects, and their relations, can read the supplement on\n Sums and Ordinary Objects.\n2.1.4 Are Sums of Stuff Non-Atomic?\n\nGodehard Link and Harry Bunt have argued that the best models of\nnatural language use of mass expressions will distinguish mass\nentities from count by treating the former as if they are non-atomic,\nwhether or not they actually are. Godehard Link (1998) argues that the\nreference of mass expressions is best understood via the development\nof a rich model-theoretic semantics, which algebraically models the\ninterrelated network of talk of mass, plural, and particular entities.\nHarry Bunt (1985) subsumes both set theory and mereology into an\naxiomatic system called \u201cEnsemble Theory\u201d in order to\nmodel the structure of talk about mass expressions. Link\u2019s\naccount in particular embraces coincidence on a massive scale.\n\nSince Link and Bunt\u2019s views are put forward in a relatively\nmetaphysically neutral way, we will relegate more information about\nthese views to an appendix. But, if the modeling they propose handles\nthe linguistic data better than other views then that will give\nfurther support to a theory which embraces both coincidence and\ninfinite divisibility. Hence these treatments are ontologically\nrelevant. Examining Link\u2019s theory in some detail can show us\njust how far distinguishing mass- and count- via the atomic/non-atomic\ndistinction can take us, and what it can\u2019t do for us. See the\nsupplement\n Non-Atomicity and the Mass/Count Distinction\n for details.\n",
