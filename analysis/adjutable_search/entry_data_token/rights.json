Categories of Rights\n\nA right to life, a right to choose; a right to vote, to work, to\nstrike; a right to one phone call, to dissolve parliament, to operate\na forklift, to asylum, to equal treatment before the law, to feel\nproud of what one has done; a right to exist, to sentence an offender\nto death, to launch a nuclear first strike, to castle kingside, to a\ndistinct genetic identity; a right to believe one\u2019s eyes, to\npronounce the couple husband and wife, to be left alone, to go to hell\nin one\u2019s own way.\n\n\nWe encounter assertions of rights as we encounter sounds: persistently\nand in great variety. To make sense of this profusion of assertions we\ncan class rights together by common attributes. Rights can be\ncategorized, for example, according to:\n\n\nWho is alleged to have the right: Children\u2019s rights,\nanimal rights, workers\u2019 rights, states\u2019 rights, the rights\nof peoples.\n\nWhat actions or states or objects\nthe asserted right pertains to: Rights of free expression, to pass\njudgment; rights of privacy, to remain silent; property rights, bodily\nrights.\n\nWhy the rightholder (allegedly) has the right: Moral rights\nare grounded in moral reasons, legal rights derive from the laws of\nthe society, customary rights exist by local convention.\n\nHow the asserted right can be affected by the\nrightholder\u2019s actions: The inalienable right to life, the\nforfeitable right to liberty, and the waivable right that a promise be\nkept.\n\n\nMany of these categories have sub-categories. For instance, natural\nrights are the sub-class of moral rights that humans have because of\ntheir nature. Or again, the rights of political speech are a subclass\nof the rights of free expression.\n\nThe study of particular rights is primarily an investigation into how\nsuch categories and sub-categories overlap. There has been much\ndiscussion, for example, of whether human rights are natural rights,\nwhether the right to privacy is a legal right, and whether the legal\nright to life is a forfeitable right. (For the central jurisprudential\ndebate over the relation between legal and moral rights, see\n legal positivism,\n natural law theories, and\n the nature of law.)\n Sometimes theorists will also do analytical work on a single\nsubcategory: for example, Steiner (2013) questions whether inalienable\nor unwaivable rights are logically possible, and Andersson (2013)\ndiscusses who moral rightholders are.\n2. The Analysis of Rights\n\nCategorization sorts the profusion of rights assertions. To understand\nthe exact meaning of any assertion of a right, we need to understand\nmore precisely how rights are constructed and what they do.\n\nAn analysis of rights has two parts: a description of the internal\nstructure of rights (their form), and a description of what rights do\nfor those who hold them (their function). The Hohfeldian system for\ndescribing the form of rights is widely accepted, although there are\nscholarly quarrels about its details. Which theory gives the best\naccount of the function of rights has been much more contentious; we\nturn to that debate in section 3.\n2.1 The Form of Rights: The Hohfeldian Analytical System\n\nAnalysis reveals that most familiar rights, such as the right to free\nexpression or the right of private property, have a complex internal\nstructure. Such rights are ordered arrangements of basic components,\nmuch in the same way that most molecules are ordered arrangements of\nchemical elements. The four basic components of rights are known as\n\u201cthe Hohfeldian incidents\u201d after Wesley Hohfeld\n(1879\u20131918), the American legal theorist who discovered them.\nThese four basic \u201celements\u201d are the privilege, the claim,\nthe power, and the immunity. Each of these Hohfeldian incidents has a\ndistinctive logical form, and the incidents fit together in\ncharacteristic ways to create complex \u201cmolecular\u201d rights.\nOnce one knows the Hohfeldian system, one can analyze precisely what\nany assertion of a right might mean.\n2.1.1 Privileges (or Liberties)\n\nYou have a right to pick up a shell that you find on the beach. This\nright is a privilege:\n\n\nA has a privilege to \u03c6 if and only if A\nhas no duty not to \u03c6.\n\n\nTo say that you have a right to pick up the shell is to say that you\nhave no duty not to pick it up. You will not be violating any\nduty not to pick up the shell should you decide to do so. Similarly\nyour right to sit in an empty seat in the cinema, and your right to\npaint your bedroom red, are also privileges. Privilege-rights mark out\nwhat their bearer has no duty not to do. When US Presidents invoke\n\u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d they deny an assertion that they\nhave a duty not to withhold evidence: they assert a Hohfeldian\nprivilege. Similarly, a license (to drive, to perform surgery, to\nkill) endows its holder with a privilege to engage in the licensed\nactivity. Someone with a license to drive has no duty not to operate\n(specified kinds of) motor vehicles (in particular ways).\n\n(Some writers on rights have preferred to speak of\n\u201cliberties\u201d instead of \u201cprivileges\u201d (e.g.,\nSteiner 1994, 59\u201360). Others have given these two terms\ndifferent definitions (e.g., Thomson 1990, 53\u201355). To avoid\nconfusion, this entry will always use \u201cprivilege\u201d and\nnever \u201cliberty\u201d to refer to the incident defined\nabove.)\n2.1.2 Claims\n\nA contract between employer and employee confers on the employee a\nright to be paid her wages. This right is a claim:\n\n\nA has a claim that B \u03c6 if and only if\nB has a duty to A to \u03c6.\n\n\nThe employee has a claim that the employer pays her her wages, which\nmeans that the employer has a duty to the employee to pay those wages.\nAs seen in the definition and the example, every claim-right\ncorrelates to a duty in (at least) one duty-bearer. What is\ndistinctive about the claim-right is that a duty-bearer\u2019s duty\nis \u201cdirected at\u201d or \u201cowed to\u201d the\nright-holder. What explains the \u201cdirection\u201d of directed\nduties has been the subject of controversy, discussed in section\n2.2.3.\n\nSome claim-rights exist independently of voluntary actions like\nsigning a contract; and some claim-rights correspond to duties in more\nthan one agent. For example, a child\u2019s claim-right against abuse\nexists independently of anyone\u2019s actions, and the child\u2019s\nclaim-right correlates to a duty in every other person not to abuse\nhim (in legal terms, the claim right is in rem). This example\nof the child\u2019s right also illustrates how some claim-rights can\nrequire duty-bearers to refrain from performing some action\n(i.e., that \u201cphi\u201d can be a negative verb such as\n\u201cnot abuse him\u201d). Bodily rights and property rights are\nparadigmatic rights with claim-rights at their core.\n2.1.3 Powers\n\nPrivileges and claims define what Hart called \u201cprimary\nrules\u201d: rules requiring that people perform or refrain from\nperforming particular actions (Hart 1961). Indeed the primary rules\nfor all physical actions are properly analyzed as privileges and\nclaims. Were we to know all privileges and claims concerning physical\nactions, we would know for every possible physical action whether that\naction was permitted, required, or forbidden.\n\nTwo further Hohfeldian incidents define what Hart called\n\u201csecondary rules\u201d: rules that specify how agents can\nintroduce and change primary rules.\n\nThe Hohfeldian power is the incident that enables agents to alter\nprimary rules:\n\n\nA has a power if and only if A has the\nability to alter her own or another\u2019s Hohfeldian incidents.\n\n\nA ship\u2019s captain has the power-right to order a midshipman to\nscrub the deck. The captain\u2019s exercise of this power changes the\nsailor\u2019s normative situation: it imposes a new duty upon the\nsailor and so annuls one of the sailor\u2019s Hohfeldian privileges\n(not to scrub the deck). Similarly, a promisor exercises a power-right\nto create in the promisee a claim that the promisor will perform a\ncertain action. The promisor\u2019s exercise of her power-right to\npromise creates in the promisee a claim that the promisor do what she\npromised to do. Or again, a neighbor waives his claim that you not\nenter his property by inviting you into his home, thus endowing you\nwith a corresponding privilege. Ordering, promising, waiving,\nabandoning, consenting, selling, and sentencing are all examples of\nacts by which a rightholder exercises a power to change his own\nHohfeldian incidents or those of another.\n\nPowers can alter not only \u201cfirst-order\u201d privileges and\nclaims, but \u201chigher-order\u201d incidents as well (Sumner 1987,\n31). An admiral, for example, has the power-right to relieve a captain\nof her power-right to command a ship. Power-rights to alter the\nauthority of others are, as we will see, definitive of all developed\nlegal and political systems.\n2.1.4 Immunities\n\nThe fourth and final Hohfeldian incident is the immunity. When\nA has the ability to alter B\u2019s Hohfeldian\nincidents, then A has a power. When A lacks\nthe ability to alter B\u2019s Hohfeldian incidents, then B\nhas an immunity:\n\n\nB has an immunity if and only if A lacks\nthe ability to alter B\u2019s Hohfeldian incidents.\n\n\nThe United States Congress lacks the ability within the Constitution\nto impose upon American citizens a duty to kneel daily before a cross.\nSince the Congress lacks a power, the citizens have an immunity. This\nimmunity is a core element of an American citizen\u2019s right to\nreligious freedom. Similarly, witnesses in court have a right not to\nbe ordered to incriminate themselves, and civil servants have a right\nnot to be dismissed when a new government comes to power. All of these\nrights are immunities, corresponding to an absence of a power in some\nother party to alter the rightholder\u2019s normative situation in\nsome way.\n2.1.5 Opposites and Correlatives\n\nHohfeld arranged the four incidents in tables of\n\u201copposites\u201d and \u201ccorrelatives\u201d so as to\ndisplay the logical structure of his system. In order to fill out the\ntables he added some further terminology. For instance, if a person\nA has a claim, then A lacks a \u201cno-claim\u201d\n(a no-claim is the opposite of a claim). And if a person A\nhas a power, then some person B has a \u201cliability\u201d\n(a liability is the correlative of a power).\n\n\nOpposites \n\nIf A has \na Claim,\nthen A lacks \na No-claim. \n\n\u2026\na Privilege,\n\u2026\na Duty. \n\n\u2026\na Power,\n\u2026\na Disability. \n\n\u2026\nan Immunity,\n\u2026\na Liability. \n\n\n\nCorrelatives \n\nIf A has \na Claim,\nthen some person B has \na Duty. \n\n\u2026\na Privilege,\n\u2026\na No-claim. \n\n\u2026\na Power,\n\u2026\na Liability. \n\n\u2026\nan Immunity,\n\u2026\na Disability. \n\n2.1.6 Molecular Rights\n\nEach of the \u201catomic\u201d incidents\u2014the privilege, claim,\npower, and immunity\u2014can be a right when it occurs in isolation.\nAnd as mentioned above these atomic incidents also bond together in\ncharacteristic ways to form complex rights. Following, for example, is\npart of the \u201cmolecular\u201d structure of the property right\nthat you have over your computer:\n\n\nPart of the \u201cMolecular\u201d Structure of a Property Right\n\n\nIn the figure, the \u201cfirst-order\u201d rights are your legal\nrights directly over your property\u2014in this case, your computer.\nThe privilege on this first level entitles you to use your computer.\nThe claim correlates to a duty in every other person not to use your\ncomputer.\n\nThe \u201csecond-order\u201d rights are your legal rights concerning\nthe alteration of these first-order rights. You have several powers\nwith respect to your claim\u2014you may waive the claim (granting\nothers permission to touch the computer), annul the claim (abandoning\nthe computer as your property), or transfer the claim (making the\ncomputer into someone else\u2019s property). Also on the second\norder, your immunity prevents others from altering your first-order\nclaim over your computer. Your immunity, that is, prevents others from\nwaiving, annulling, or transferring your claim over your computer. The\nfour incidents together constitute a significant portion of your\nproperty right.\n\nOf course all of these incidents are qualified: you have no privilege\nto use your computer as a weapon, or to use your computer to hack into\nsomeone else\u2019s machine; and your immunity may not entirely block\nout the state\u2019s power of expropriation (if for example the\ncomputer becomes evidence in a criminal case). These qualifications to\nthe incidents carve the contours of your property right, but they do\nnot affect its basic shape.\n\nThere may also be more incidents associated with ownership than shown\nin the figure above. Wellman (1985, 1995) describes each right as\nhaving a \u201cdefining core\u201d surrounded by \u201cassociated\nelements\u201d which may be present or absent in a particular case.\nYour property right, for instance, may also be protected by a\nqualified third-order immunity against the government altering your\nsecond-order rights over your property (for example, under the\n\u201cTakings Clause\u201d of the Fifth Amendment to the US\nConstitution the government cannot simply annul your right to sell a\nparcel of your land).\n2.1.7 Active and Passive Rights\n\nThe distinction between active and passive rights (Lyons 1970) maps\nneatly onto the Hohfeldian incidents. The privilege and the power are\n\u201cactive\u201d rights that concern their holders\u2019 own\nactions. The claim and the immunity are \u201cpassive\u201d rights\nthat regulate the actions of others. Active rights are signaled by\nstatements of the form \u201cA has a right to \u03c6\u201d;\nwhile passive rights are signaled by statements of the form\n\u201cA has a right that B \u03c6\u201d (in both of\nthese formulas, \u201c\u03c6\u201d is an active verb).\n\nA naval captain has an (active) privilege-right to walk the decks and\nan (active) power-right to order that the ship set sail. A player in a\nchess tournament has a (passive) claim-right that his opponent not\ndistract him, and a professor has a (passive) immunity-right that her\nuniversity not fire her for publishing unpopular views.\n2.1.8 Negative and Positive Rights\n\nA distinction between negative and positive rights is popular among\nsome normative theorists, especially those with a bent toward\nlibertarianism. The holder of a negative right is entitled to\nnon-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to\nprovision of some good or service. A right against assault is a\nclassic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare\nassistance is a prototypical positive right (Narveson 2001).\n\nSince both negative and positive rights are passive rights, some\nrights are neither negative nor positive. Privileges and powers cannot\nbe negative rights; and privileges, powers, and immunities cannot be\npositive rights. The (privilege-) right to enter a building, and the\n(power-) right to enter into a binding agreement, are neither negative\nnor positive.\n\nIt is sometimes said that negative rights are easier to satisfy than\npositive rights. Negative rights can be respected simply by each\nperson refraining from interfering with each other, while it may be\ndifficult or even impossible to fulfill everyone\u2019s positive\nrights if the sum of people\u2019s claims outstrips the resources\navailable.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the enforcement of rights, this difference\ndisappears. Funding a legal system that enforces citizens\u2019\nnegative rights against assault may require more resources than\nfunding a welfare system that realizes citizens\u2019 positive rights\nto assistance. As Holmes and Sunstein (1999, 43) put it, in the\ncontext of citizens\u2019 rights to state enforcement, all rights are\npositive. Moreover, the point is often made that the moral urgency of\nsecuring positive rights may be just as great as the moral urgency of\nsecuring negative rights (Shue 1996). Whatever is the justificatory\nbasis for ascribing rights\u2014autonomy, need, or something\nelse\u2014there might be just as strong a moral case for fulfilling a\nperson\u2019s right to adequate nutrition as there is for protecting\nthat person\u2019s right not to be assaulted.\n2.2 The Function of Rights: The Will Theory and the Interest Theory\n2.2.1 Conceptual Analysis versus Definitional Stipulation\n\nAll rights can be represented by Hohfeldian diagrams, like the diagram\nof the property right \u201cmolecule\u201d above (Halpin 2017).\nHowever, some diagrams of Hohfeldian incidents that we can construct\ndo not correspond to any right. To take a simple example from Hart\n(1982, 191\u201392), your city council lacks the Hohfeldian power to\naward you a pension; so by definition you have a Hohfeldian immunity\nagainst your city council awarding you a pension. Yet it would be odd\nto say that you have a right against your city council awarding you a\npension. You thus have an immunity, but not a right. Not all\n(collections of) Hohfeldian incidents are rights; it is only those\n(collections of) Hohfeldian incidents that have a certain\nfunction (or perhaps certain functions) that are rights.\nTo take an analogy: all engagement rings are rings, but only rings\nwith a certain function are engagement rings. What, then, is the\nfunction of rights?\n\nThe question of the function of rights is the question of what rights\ndo for those who hold them. Before discussing the two major positions\non this issue, we can survey some statements that theorists have made\nthat may appear to be describing which Hohfeldian incidents are\nrights:\n\nTo have a right is to have a \u201cvalid claim.\u201d (Feinberg\n1970, 257)\n\u201cIn the strictest sense\u201d all rights are claims.\n(Hohfeld 1919, 36) \n\u201cRights are built around the claims of patients on an\nagent.\u201d (Walen 2019, 58) \n\u201cA right, in the most important sense, is the conjunction of\na [privilege] and a claim-right.\u201d (Mackie 1979, 169)\n\u201cRights are permissions rather than requirements. Rights\ntell us what the bearer is at liberty to do.\u201d (Louden 1983,\n95)\n\u201cNo one ever has a right to do something; he only has a\nright that some one else shall do (or refrain from doing)\nsomething.\u201d (Williams 1968, 125)\n\u201cA person who says to another \u2018I have a right to do\nit\u2019 is not saying that \u2026 it is not wrong to do it. He is\nclaiming that the other has a duty not to interfere.\u201d (Raz 1994,\n275)\n\u201cA right is an established way of acting.\u201d (Martin\n1993, 1)\n\u201cIt is hard to think of rights except as capable of\nexercise.\u201d (Hart 1982, 185)\n\u201cA right is a power which a creature ought to\npossess.\u201d (Plamenatz 1938, 82)\n\u201cAll rights are essentially property rights.\u201d (Steiner\n1994, 93)\n\u201cRights are themselves property, things we\nown.\u201d (Feinberg 1973, 75)\n\n\nAt first, this survey might remind one the proverb of the blind men,\neach of whom is feeling a different part of an elephant. However, we\nshould distinguish between two different aims that a theorist might\nhave when she makes a statement of the form \u201cAll rights are\nx.\u201d A theorist may be attempting to analyze\nthe meaning of our ordinary concept of rights, or she may be\nstipulating a definition of \u201crights\u201d within her\nown ethical, political or legal theory.\n\nConsider, for example, Mill\u2019s famous assertion in\nUtilitarianism:\n\n\nWhen we call anything a person\u2019s right, we mean that he has a\nvalid claim on society to protect him in the possession of it, either\nby the force of law, or by that of education and opinion\u2026 To\nhave a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society\nought to defend me in the possession of. (Mill 1861, 54)\n\n\nAs an analysis of the everyday concept of a right, Mill\u2019s\nassertion would be weak. For example, for centuries many people have\nasserted that God has the right to command man; yet presumably no one\nwho asserts such a right would commit to the idea that society ought\nto defend God in the possession of the power to command. To take\nanother example, there seems nothing incoherent in the thought that\nindividuals have a right not to be protected by society; yet this\nthought could not make sense on Mill\u2019s characterization of what\nrights are. (On Mill, see also Hart 1982, 100\u201304.)\n\nMill\u2019s statement is better seen not as an analysis of the\neveryday concept, but as a stipulative definition of the term\n\u201cright.\u201d Mill stipulates this particular definition\nbecause the idea of \u201cthose possessive relations that are\nvaluable enough that it is worthwhile for society to institute\nsanctions to protect them\u201d is an idea that works well within his\nlarger utilitarian theory. So where Mill\u2019s statement departs\nfrom the common understanding of rights, we should charitably read\nMill as prescribing, instead of describing, usage. Many authors\u2019\npronouncements about rights are charitably interpreted as these kinds\nof exercises in stipulation, rather than as attempts to analyze the\nordinary concept of rights.\n\nTo take an example from the scholarly literature, it is not uncommon\nto encounter a general statement that all rights are (or at least\ninclude) claim-rights (see, e.g., Raz 1986, 166, 173\u201375;\nSteiner, 1994, 55; Kramer, Steiner and Simmonds 1999, 9\u201314).\nThese \u201call rights are claims\u201d statements are better\ninterpreted as stipulative, rather than as analyses of common usage.\n\u201cAll rights are claims\u201d positions cannot recognize, for\nexample, the rights in the Hobbesian state of nature, in which each\nperson has unlimited privilege-rights of self-defense yet no\nclaim-rights against attack. Neither could an \u201call rights are\nclaims\u201d theory recognize that the US Constitution gives Congress\nthe sole (power-) right to declare war. The statement that rights are\nclaims is prescriptive for, not descriptive of, usage.\n\nOccasionally a theorist will say that she is presenting neither an\nanalysis of the ordinary concept of a right, nor merely stipulating a\nnew meaning for the term \u201cright,\u201d but is rather offering\nsome third type of characterization. For instance, Wellman (1995, 136)\nsays that his narrow specification of \u201ca right\u201d is needed\nto provide \u201ca clearer and more revealing map of the law.\u201d\nRaz (1986, 166) frames a contrasting \u201cphilosophical\ndefinition\u201d that, he says, \u201cilluminates a tradition of\npolitical and moral discourse in which different theories offer\nincompatible views of what rights there are and why.\u201d Whether\nthere is room for such a third category of \u201cphilosophical\ndefinition,\u201d which goes beyond both ordinary analysis and\nstipulation, is contested (Wenar 2008).\n2.2.2 The Will Theory and the Interest Theory\n\nThere are two main theories of the function of rights: the will theory\nand the interest theory. Each theory presents itself as capturing an\nordinary understanding of what rights do for those who hold them.\nWhich theory offers the better account of the functions of rights has\nbeen the subject of spirited dispute, literally for ages.\n\nWill theorists maintain that a right makes the rightholder \u201ca\nsmall scale sovereign\u201d (Hart 1982, 183). More specifically, a\nwill theorist asserts that the function of a right is to give its\nholder control over another\u2019s duty. Your property right\ndiagrammed in the figure above is a right, says the will theorist,\nbecause it contains a power to waive (or annul, or transfer)\nothers\u2019 duties. You are the \u201csovereign\u201d of your\ncomputer, in that you may permit others to touch it or not at your\ndiscretion. Similarly a promisee is \u201csovereign\u201d over the\naction of the promisor: a promisee has a right because she has the\npower to waive (or annul) the promisor\u2019s duty to keep the\npromise. In Hohfeldian terms, will theorists assert that every right\nincludes a Hohfeldian power over a claim. In colloquial terms, will\ntheorists believe that all rights confer control over others\u2019\nduties to act in particular ways.\n\nInterest theorists disagree. Interest theorists maintain that the\nfunction of a right is to further the right-holder\u2019s interests.\nAn owner has a right, according to the interest theorist, not because\nowners have choices, but because the ownership makes owners better\noff. A promisee has a right because promisees have some interest in\nthe performance of the promise, or (alternatively) some interest in\nbeing able to form voluntary bonds with others. Your rights, the\ninterest theorist says, are the Hohfeldian incidents you have that are\ngood for you.\n\nThe contest between will-based and interest-based theories of the\nfunction of rights has been waged for hundreds of years. Influential\nwill theorists include Kant, Savigny, Hart, Kelsen, Wellman, and\nSteiner. Important interest theorists include Bentham, Ihering,\nAustin, Lyons, MacCormick, Raz, and Kramer. Each theory has stronger\nand weaker points as an account of what rights do for\nrightholders.\n\nThe will theory captures the powerful link between rights and\nnormative control. To have a right is to have the ability to determine\nwhat others may and may not do, and so to exercise authority over a\ncertain domain of affairs. The resonant connection between rights and\nauthority (the authority to control what others may do) is for will\ntheorists a matter of definition.\n\nHowever, the will theory\u2019s account of the function of rights\nstruggles to explain many rights that most think there are. Within the\nwill theory, there can be no such thing as an unwaivable right: a\nright over which its holder has no power. Yet intuitively it would\nappear that unwaivable rights are some of the most important rights\nthat we have: consider, for example, the unwaivable right not to be\nenslaved (MacCormick 1977, 197). Moreover, since the will theorist\nholds that all rights confer sovereignty, she cannot acknowledge that\nbeings incapable of exercising sovereignty have rights. Within the\nwill theory, it is impossible for incompetents like infants, animals,\nand comatose adults to have rights. Yet we ordinarily would not doubt\nthat these incompetents can have rights, for example the right not to\nbe tortured (MacCormick 1982, 154\u201366). Will theories also have\ndifficulties explaining bare privilege-rights (such as in the\nHobbesian state of nature), which are not rights of authority over\nothers.\n\nThe interest theory is more capacious than the will theory. It can\naccommodate both unwaivable rights (the possession of which may be\ngood for their holders) and the rights of incompetents (who have\ninterests that rights can protect). The interest theory also taps into\nthe deeply plausible connection between holding rights and being\nbetter off.\n\nHowever, the interest theory is also misaligned with any ordinary\nunderstanding of rights. We commonly accept that people can have\ninterests in x without having a right to x; and\ncontrariwise that people can have a right to x without having\ninterests sufficient to explain this. In the first category are\n\u201cthird party beneficiaries\u201d (Lyons 1994, 36\u201346). You\nmay have a powerful interest in the lottery paying out for your\nspouse\u2019s winning ticket, but you have no right that the lottery\npays out to your spouse. In the second category are many of the rights\nof office-holders and role-bearers (Jones 1994, 31\u201332; Wenar\n2013b). Whatever interest a judge may have in sentencing a convict to\nlife in prison, the judge\u2019s interests cannot justify ascribing\nto her the power to make such a dramatic change in the convict\u2019s\nnormative situation.\n\nThe difficulties of the interest theory have often been noted in\nRaz\u2019s version, which is perhaps the most prominent. In\nRaz\u2019s account, \u201cX has a right if X can have rights, and,\nother things being equal, an aspect of X\u2019s well-being (his\ninterest) is a sufficient reason for holding some other person(s) to\nbe under a duty\u201d (Raz 1986, 166).\n\nYet there appear to be many rights for which the interests of the\nputative right-holder are not sufficient to hold other person(s) to be\nunder a duty. For example, Raz himself notices that the interest of a\njournalist in protecting his sources is not itself sufficient reason\nto hold others to be under a duty not to pressure the journalist to\nreveal his sources (Raz 1986, 179, 247\u20138). Raz says that it is\nrather the interests of the general public in an active and\nindependent media that grounds the journalist\u2019s right to protect\nhis sources. Yet as Kamm then objects to Raz, \u201cIf the\nsatisfaction of the interests of others is the reason why the\njournalist gets a right to have his interest protected, his interest\nis not sufficient to give rise to the duty of noninterference\nwith his speech\u201d (Kamm 2002, 485; for a defense of Raz, see\nPallikkathayil 2016).\n\nNor does this difficulty only affect the rights of office-holders like\njournalists; Raz admits that weighty rights such as the rights of free\nexpression and freedom of contract are not justified solely by the\ninterests of the individual citizens who hold them, but also by the\nways that these rights further the common good (Raz 1995,\n30\u201343, 131). Or again, parents may have the right to receive\nchild benefit payments from the state, but here only the interests of\nthe children, and not the interests of the parents, could be\nsufficient to hold the state to be under a duty.\n\nRaz\u2019s version of the interest theory continues to be the most\nwidely-cited account of the function of rights, despite such concerns\nthat are now commonplace in the specialist literature. Kramer\u2019s\nversion of the interest theory, which specifies necessary conditions\nfor holding a legal right, is the major contemporary alternative\n(Kramer 2013, 2017).\n\nWill theorists and interest theorists have developed their positions\nwith increasing technical sophistication. The issues that divide the\ntwo camps are clearly defined, and the debates between them are often\nintense (Kramer, Simmonds, and Steiner 1998, Van Duffel 2012a, Kramer\n2013, McBride 2017, Frydrych 2018). The seemingly interminable debate\nbetween these two major theories has driven some to conclude that the\ndebate itself rests on the mistaken premise that there is a single\nconcept of a right for which these theories provide rival analyses\n(Van Duffel 2012b, Hayward 2013). The deadlock has encouraged other\ntheorists to develop alternative positions on the function of\nrights.\n\n\u201cDemand\u201d theories fill out the idea that, as Feinberg\n(1973, 58\u201359) puts it, \u201cA right is something a man can\nstand on, something that can be demanded or insisted upon without\nembarrassment or shame.\u201d For Darwall (2006, 18), to have a\nclaim-right, \u201cincludes a second-personal authority to resist,\ncomplain, remonstrate, and perhaps use coercive measures of other\nkinds, including, perhaps, to gain compensation if the right is\nviolated.\u201d On Skorupski\u2019s account (2010, XII.6,\nXIV.2\u20133) rights specify what the right-holder may demand of\nothers, where \u201cdemand\u201d implies the permissibility of\ncompelling performance or exacting compensation for non-performance.\nLike the will theory, these demand theories center on the agency of\nthe right-holder. They do not turn on the right-holder\u2019s power\nover the duty of another, so they do not share the will theory\u2019s\ndifficulty with unwaivable rights. They may, however, have more\ndifficulties in explaining power-rights. Demand theories also share\nthe will-theory\u2019s challenges in explaining the rights of\nincompetents, and in explaining privilege-rights. \n\nGilbert (2018) develops not a demand theory of rights, but a theory of\na special class of rights that she calls \u201cdemand-rights.\u201d\nIn her formulation, \u201cX has a demand-right against Y if and only\nif X has the standing to demand of Y that Y \u03c6\u201d (2018, 70).\nGilbert\u2019s paradigm of a demand-right is a promissory right: the\npromisee has the standing to demand performance from the promisor,\nmeaning that the promisee has the authority to demand that the\npromisor do what she promised to do. Gilbert explains this standing to\ndemand in terms of her theory of joint commitment (2013).\n\nOther analyses of what rights do for rightholders are varied. Scanlon\n(2003, 2013) defends the position that rights are constraints on the\ndiscretion of individuals or institutions to act. Sreenivasan (2005,\n2010) puts forward a \u201chybrid\u201d analysis of the claim-right\nthat grafts the interest theory onto the will theory: here the\nfunction of the claim-right is to endow the right-holder with the\namount of control over another\u2019s duty that advances her\ninterests. Wenar (2005) abandons the idea that all rights have any\nsingle function, and sets out a \u201cseveral functions\u201d theory\non which rights perform six distinct functions. Wenar (2013b) then\nsets out a \u201ckind desire\u201d theory of claim-rights, which\nturns on what role-bearers like journalists and parents want as such,\nand more generally on what beings (like humans) want qua the kinds of\nbeings that they are.\n\nScanlon\u2019s analysis is criticized in Gilbert (2004), Wenar\n(2013a); Sreenivasan\u2019s and Wenar\u2019s analyses are critiqued\nin Kramer and Steiner (2007), May (2012). Kramer\u2019s,\nSreenivasan\u2019s and Wenar\u2019s theories are criticized and\ndeveloped in essays by Kramer, May, Penner, Sreenivasan, McBride, and\nCruft in McBride (2017); Kramer\u2019s theory is modified in Kurki\n(2018); Wenar\u2019s theory is defended in Schaab (2018).\n2.2.3 The Direction of a Duty\n\nRecently, theorists have attempted to make progress on the question of\nthe function of rights by scrutinizing the claim-right in particular,\nand by shifting attention onto the duty that corresponds to it. As\nabove, on the standard account what is distinctive about the\nclaim-right is that a duty-bearer\u2019s duty is \u201cdirected\nat\u201d or \u201cowed to\u201d the right-holder. (The promisor,\nfor example, owes a duty of performance to the promisee.) Yet what\ncould account for the directionality of such \u201cdirected\nduties\u201d? (May 2015)\n\nAfter all, not all duties are directed to specific others. For\nexample, the moral duty of affluent people to give some of their\nwealth to charity is not owed to any specific person. And\n\u201cdirected duties\u201d appear to have special normative\nsignificance. The violation of any duty may be wrong (it may be\nwrong for a rich person to give nothing to charity). But the violation\nof a directed duty is more than just a wrong: it is a wronging\nof the being to whom the duty is owed (Thompson 2004). And unlike a\nmere wrong, the wronging of some being calls, ceteris paribus,\nfor apology and compensation. Cruft (2013) further argues that the\nviolation of any duty owed to a being is disrespectful of that being.\nThe question is what could possibly account for the extra significance\nof the duties that have direction. (Cornell 2015 argues against the\nthesis that one can wrong only those to whom one has directed\nduties.)\n\nDarwall (2012) argues that his second-personal theory of morality best\nexplains the relation between duty-bearer and right-holder. (Yet see\nVankieken 2019.) Cruft (2019) agrees that the directed duty-bearer is\nrequired by the nature of her duty to conceive of the right-holder\nsecond-personally, as \u201cyou, on whom I act.\u201d Cruft then\ndistinguishes natural and human rights, which are grounded largely by\nthe good of the right-holder, from conventional rights, which are\ngrounded by how they serve people or values besides the right-holder.\nCruft argues that most property rights are conventional, yet seem to\nbe natural in such a dangerously ideological way that we should speak\nof them as not rights at all, but rather merely as involving certain\ncontrollable duties of others.\n3. The History of the Language of Rights\n\nIntellectual historians have disputed the origins of rights. These\ndebates are sometimes framed in terms of when \u201cthe concept of a\nright\u201d emerged. Yet insofar as it is really the emergence of the\nconcept of a right that is at issue, the answer lies beyond\nthe competence of the intellectual historian and within the domain of\nthe anthropologist. Even the most primitive social order must include\nrules specifying that certain individuals or groups have special\npermission to perform certain actions. Moreover, even the most\nrudimentary human communities must have rules specifying that some are\nentitled to tell others what they must do. Such rules ascribe rights.\nThe genesis of the concept of a right was simultaneous with reflective\nawareness of such social norms, however our forebears decided to\ndescribe those norms.\n\nThe more productive characterization of the debate within intellectual\nhistory concerns when a word (or phrase) appeared that has a\nmeaning close to the meaning of our modern word. This debate turns on\nwhen in history the pre-modern \u201cobjective\u201d sense of\n\u201cright\u201d came also to bear our modern,\n\u201csubjective\u201d sense of \u201ca right.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight\u201d in its older, objective sense means \u201cwhat is\njust\u201d or \u201cwhat is fair\u201d (Finnis 1980, 206).\nAristotle uses dikaion, for example, to indicate that a\nsociety is \u201crightly ordered\u201d: that it displays the correct\nstructure of human relationships. \u201cRight\u201d in this\nobjective sense can also be attributed to individuals. The Roman\njurist Ulpian, for instance, held that justice means rendering each\nhis right (ius). In this sense, a person\u2019s\n\u201cright\u201d is what is due to him given his role or status.\nThis objective sense of \u201cright\u201d is not the same as our\nmodern idea of \u201ca right.\u201d For instance, Ulpian noted that\nthe ius of a parricide was to be sewn into a sack of snakes\nand tossed into the Tiber (Tierney 1997, 16).\n\nThere has been a long and divisive scholarly inquiry into when our\nmodern, subjective sense of \u201ca right\u201d became established\nas a meaning of some word or phrase. The history is uncertain partly\nbecause the ancient authors often used words imprecisely, and smeared\ntheir meanings across and beyond the Hohfeldian categories. The\nintellectual historians themselves have occasionally congested the\ndiscussion by taking different features of rights as definitive of the\nmodern concept. Moreover, the scholarly debate has sometimes accepted\nover-optimistic assumptions about the sharpness of conceptual\nboundaries.\n\nNevertheless, two broad trends in the scholarly discussions have\nemerged. The first is to push the origins of a term indicating a\nmodern, subjective sense of \u201ca right\u201d back further into\nhistory: from Locke to Hobbes to Grotius in the seventeenth century,\nthen to Gerson in the fifteenth century, then to Ockham in the\nfourteenth, perhaps even to Gratian in the twelfth (Brett 1997,\nTierney 1997, Siedentop 2014, Lisska and Tierney 2015). Donohue (2010)\neven argues that ius is used in a subjective sense throughout\nthe works of the classical Roman jurists in the first century BCE to\nthe third century CE.\n\nThe second and related trend has been to establish that terms\nreferring to active rights (what we would call privilege-rights and\npower-rights) predate terms referring to passive rights (what we would\ncall claim-rights and immunity-rights). It appears that the earliest\nmedieval debates using recognizably modern rights-language, for\ninstance, concerned topics such as whether the pope has a (power-)\nright to rule an earthly empire, and whether the poor have a\n(privilege-) right to take what they need from the surplus of the\nrich.\n4. Rights and Freedom\n\nMost rights entitle their holders to freedom in some sense; indeed\nholding a right can entail that one is free in one or more of a\nvariety of senses. In the most general terms, the active\nincidents\u2014the privilege and the power\u2014entitle their\nholders to freedom to act in certain ways. The passive\nincidents\u2014the claim and the immunity\u2014often entitle their\nholders to freedom from undesirable actions or states.\n\nWe can be more specific. A single privilege-right makes its holder\n\u201cfree to\u201d in the sense of non-forbiddenness. A spy with a\nsecurity clearance, for instance, may have a privilege-right that\nmeans she is free to enter a highly classified facility of her own\ngovernment. One can be free in this non-forbidden way without having\nthe physical ability to do what one is free to do. The spy, for\ninstance, still has \u201cno duty not\u201d to enter the classified\nfacility even when she is languishing in a distant foreign prison. The\nactions that one is free to do in this sense may or may not be\nphysically possible for one at the moment, but at least they are not\ndisallowed by the relevant norms.\n\nSomeone who has a pair of privilege rights\u2014no duty to perform\nthe action, no duty not to perform the action\u2014is free in an\nadditional sense of having discretion over whether to perform the\naction or not. For example, you may be free to join a protest march,\nor not, as you like. This dual non-forbiddenness again does not imply\nphysical ability. A rightholder may be permitted to perform or not\nperform some action, but this still does not mean that she is capable\nof performing the action that she is free to perform.\n\nIn contrast, the holder of a power-right does have an ability. This is\nthe normative ability to exercise authority in a certain way\n(Sumner 1987, 28). This normative ability confers freedom in a\ndifferent sense. A judge is free to sentence a convicted criminal to\nprison. The judge is not merely allowed to sentence the prisoner: her\npower-right gives her the ability\u2014that is, the\nauthority\u2014to do so. Her (power-) right makes her free to\nsentence in a way that non-judges are not free to sentence.\n\nAs for the passive rights, many claim-rights entitle their holders to\nbe free from the physical interference or surveillance of others.\nOther claim-rights entitle their holders to be free from undesirable\nconditions like hunger or fear. Immunity-rights parallel claim-rights\none level up. Immunity-rights make their holders free from the\nauthority of others, and so entitle their holders to be free from\nconditions like tyranny or exploitation.\n\nA legal system can be seen as a distribution of all of these varieties\nof freedom. Any legal system will set out rules specifying who is free\nto act in which ways, and who should be free from which unwanted\nactions and conditions. A developed legal system will also determine\nwho has the authority (and so who is free) to interpret and enforce\nthese rules.\n\nMore generally, any political constitution can be seen as a\nmulti-leveled structure of rights that distributes authority over\nrules of conduct in a distinctive way. A democratic constitution, for\nexample, may give voters the power to elect legislators, who have\ncertain powers to enact laws, which the judiciary has certain powers\nto interpret, and the police have certain powers to enforce, leaving\ncertain courses of conduct open as legal for citizens to pursue. The\nfacts about who should be free to do what within any legal or\npolitical system, as well as the facts about who should be free from\nwhich actions and conditions, can be represented as complex, layered\nstructures of rights\u2014exponentially more complex than in the\ndiagram of the property right above.\n5. Rights and Reasons\n5.1 Rights as Trumps\n\nThough there are disputes over the function of rights and the history\nof rights language, most agree that rights have special normative\nforce. The reasons that rights provide are particularly powerful or\nweighty reasons, which override reasons of other sorts.\nDworkin\u2019s metaphor is of rights as \u201ctrumps\u201d (Dworkin\n1984). Rights permit their holders to act in certain ways, or give\nreasons to treat their holders in certain ways or permit their holders\nto act in certain ways, even if some social aim would be served by\ndoing otherwise. As Mill wrote of the trumping power of the right to\nfree expression: \u201cIf all mankind minus one were of one opinion,\nmankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person than\nhe, if he had the power, would be in silencing mankind\u201d (Mill\n1859, 20).\n\nHow rights become imbued with this special normative force is a matter\nof ongoing scholarly inquiry. As Sreenivasan (2010) notes, a\nHohfeldian claim-right in itself only entails the existence of a duty\nwith a certain structure, and not a duty with a certain force.\nA has a claim against B if and only if B has a duty\nto A: in this definition it is the \u201cdirection\u201d of\nB\u2019s duty (that it is owed to A) which\ncorrelates B\u2019s duty to A\u2019s right;\nnothing is said in the definition about the duty\u2019s strength. Why\n\u201cdirected duties\u201d\u2014as above, those owed to an\nentity\u2014have greater normative priority remains an open question:\nthe only broad consensus is that they do. (See Thompson 2004 on\n\u201cbipolar\u201d judgments.)\n\nDworkin\u2019s metaphor suggests that rights trump non-right\nobjectives, such as increasing national wealth. What of the priority\nof one right with respect to another? We can keep to the trumps\nmetaphor while recognizing that some rights have a higher priority\nthan others. Within the trump suit, a jack still beats a seven or a\nthree. Your right of way at a flashing yellow light has priority over\nthe right of way of the driver facing a flashing red; and the right of\nway of an ambulance with sirens on trumps you both.\n\nThis metaphor of trumps leads naturally to the question of whether\nthere is any right that has priority to absolutely all other normative\nconsiderations: whether there is an \u201cace of rights.\u201d\nGewirth (1981) asserts that there is at least one such absolute right:\nthe right of all persons not to be made the victim of a homicidal\nproject. For such a right to be absolute, it would have to trump every\nother consideration whatsoever: other rights, economic efficiency,\nsaving lives, everything. Not all would agree with Gewirth that even\nthis very powerful right overrides every conceivable normative\nconcern. Some would think it might be justifiable to infringe even\nthis right were this somehow necessary, for example, to prevent the\ndeaths of a great many people. If it is permissible to kill one in\norder to save a billion, then not even Gewirth\u2019s right is\nabsolute.\n5.2 Conflicts of Rights?\n\nMost theorists would agree that A\u2019s claim-right gives\nB what Raz (1975, 35\u201348) calls an exclusionary reason:\na second-order reason not to act on some first-order reason.\nDworkin\u2019s trumping metaphor makes it tempting to characterize\nthe normative force of rights in the stronger terms of\nconclusive reasons. We could indeed attempt to define the\nHohfeldian incidents in these terms. A\u2019s having a\nclaim-right that B \u03c6 would imply that B has a\nconclusive reason to \u03c6, and A\u2019s having a\nprivilege-right to \u03c6 would imply that A has no conclusive\nreason not to \u03c6. Powers and immunities would then determine the\nways in which agents were and were not able to alter the patterns of\nconclusive reasons in the world.\n\nWere we to go this route, we would need to temper the\n\u201cconclusiveness\u201d of the conclusive reasons implied by\nrights assertions to accommodate the facts that some rights have\npriority to others, and that few if any rights outweigh absolutely all\nnon-right considerations in all circumstances. If we associate rights\nwith conclusive reasons, then for at least most rights these reasons\ncan only be conclusive with respect to some but not all competing\nconsiderations.\n\nThis line of thought can be developed by saying that the reasons\nassociated with rights are conclusive within the area covered by\nthe right, but are not conclusive outside of that area. Each\nright trumps competing considerations in most circumstances, but there\nare certain circumstances in which another right with higher\npriority\u2014or a pressing non-right consideration\u2014determines\nwhat may or should be done. From this perspective, the conclusive\nreasons implied by rights assertions really are conclusive, but only\nwithin certain circumstances. Every right is absolute, within a\nprecisely delimited space. (Contrast this position with\nGewirth\u2019s defense of a single, unqualified absolute right.)\n\nThe theoretical position at the end of this line of thought is called\n\u201cspecificationism\u201d (Shafer-Landau 1995, Oberdiek 2008).\nThe specificationist holds that each right is defined by an elaborate\nset of qualifications that specify when it does and when it does not\napply: a set of qualifications that define the right\u2019s\n\u201cspace.\u201d\n\nThe test of specificationism is how convincingly it can explain what\noccurs when rights appear to conflict. Rights do often appear to\nconflict (Sinnott-Armstrong 1996; Kamm 2007, 262\u2013301). For example, on\na certain day it may seem that the public\u2019s right to protest is\nconflicting with the government\u2019s right to keep order on public\nproperty. When confronted with a case like this one, we will judge\nthat one or the other (say, the public\u2019s) right should prevail.\nHowever, we do not believe that one of these rights is always stronger\nthan the other. Given different circumstances, our judgment might\nfavor the other (in this case, the government\u2019s) right. When\nrights appear to conflict like this, the usefulness of the image of\nrights as trumps begins to dim. Both of these rights are trump cards,\nyet it does not appear that one right always trumps the other.\n\nA specificationist will attempt to dispel any appearance of conflict\nof rights. For example, a specificationist will say that what is\ncolloquially referred to as \u201cthe public\u2019s right to\nprotest\u201d is actually, on closer examination, \u201cthe\npublic\u2019s right to protest, unless the protest would cause\nserious risk to life or property, or would lead to the spread of a\ndeadly disease, or\u2026\u201d Similarly, the government\u2019s\nright should really be specified more fully as the right: \u201cto\ncontrol what happens on public property, but not to the extent of\nstopping peaceful protest, unless the protest would lead to the spread\nof deadly disease, but not\u2026\u201d On the specificationist\nview, rights never do conflict in the sense of overlapping in a given\ncase. Rather, rights fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle, so\nthat in each circumstance there is only one right which determines\nwhat is permitted, forbidden or required. Every right is absolute\nwithin its own area, but the area in which each right prevails is\nelaborately gerrymandered. Rights never conflict: they are always, to\nuse Steiner\u2019s phrase, \u201ccompossible\u201d (Steiner\n1994).\n\nFeinberg (1980, 221\u201351) and Thomson (1990, 82\u2013104) object\nto this specificationist view of rights. First, fully specified rights\nwould be unknowable: no one could set out all of the qualifications\nthat define even the simplest right. Second, rights so understood lose\ntheir explanatory force: for the specificationist rights can only be\nthe conclusions, not the premises, of arguments concerning which side\nin any dispute should prevail. Third, specificationists cannot explain\nthe \u201cmoral residue\u201d of a \u201cdefeated\u201d right. For\ninstance, consider a case in which your property right in the pie\ncooling on your window sill conflicts with John\u2019s right to do\nwhat he must do to keep from starving. John\u2019s right may prevail\nin this case: John may have a right to eat your pie. Still, after John\nrightfully eats your pie he should apologize to you, and compensate\nyou if he can.\n\nThomson alleges that specificationists cannot explain the requirements\nthat John apologizes to and compensates you, since on the\nspecificationist view there is no right of yours that he has violated\nwhen he consumes your food. Thomson prefers the view that there really\nare conflicts of rights, and suggests that we should speak of a\n\u201cdefeated\u201d right as being permissibly\n\u201cinfringed\u201d (instead of \u201cviolated\u201d), leaving\nresidual obligations on the infringer. Frederick (2014) chases down\nsome specificationist replies to these objections, and concludes that\nalthough moral rights are strong moral considerations, they are only\npro tanto. Liberto (2014) develops a more sophisticated\nspecificationist position, which is critiqued by Montague (2015).\nMullins (forthcoming) offers a logical framework of practical reasoning that\nclaims to capture the dynamics of the debate over specification.\n5.3 Support among Rights\n\nPhilosophers have discussed not only how rights can conflict, but how\nthey sometimes support one another. For example, Henry Shue has argued\nthat both rights of security and rights of subsistence are\n\u201cbasic rights\u201d because they are indispensable for the full\nenjoyment of all other rights\u2014while other rights are non-basic\nbecause they are not indispensable for the enjoyment of these two. If\nthe enjoyment or realization of a controversial right is an important\nprecondition for the enjoyment of an uncontroversial right, one can\ndefend the controversial right by documenting its strong supporting\nrole. Such a \u201clinkage argument\u201d is used by Shue to defend\nthe right to subsistence as a basic right, and by Sen to defend rights\nto democracy and freedom of the press as supportive of the right to\nadequate nutrition in developing countries (Shue 1996, Sen 1999).\nShue\u2019s and Sen\u2019s assertions have been criticized as\nexaggerated (Nickel 2008, Myhvold-Hanssen 2003 (in the Other Internet\nResources)).\n\nNickel (2008, 2010, 2016) develops a sophisticated typology of\nsupporting relations between rights (see also Gilabert 2010). One\nright strongly supports another when it is logically or practically\ninconsistent to endorse the implementation of the second right without\nendorsing the simultaneous implementation of the first. For example,\nthe right to bodily security strongly supports the right to freedom of\nassembly. One right weakly supports another when it is useful but not\nessential to it. The right to education, for example, weakly supports\nthe right to a fair trial. Nickel argues that the strength of\nsupporting relations between rights varies with quality of\nimplementation. Poorly implemented rights provide little support to\nother rights, while ones that are more effectively implemented tend to\nprovide greater support to other rights. The right to due process\nsupports the right to equal treatment for members of different racial\nand ethnic groups\u2014but the support will be soft if the right to\ndue process is only weakly implemented.\n\nRights that weakly support each other are interdependent. Rights that\nstrongly support each other are indivisible. Beginning with the 1968\nProclamation of Tehran, the United Nations has promoted the idea that\n\u201cSince human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible,\nthe full realization of civil and political rights without the\nenjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights is impossible\u201d\n(see Whelan 2010). Nickel holds that this indivisibility thesis\nexaggerates the density and strength of supporting relations among\nhuman rights. He allows, however, that many supporting relations exist\nbetween rights\u2014particularly under high-quality\nimplementation\u2014and endorses the use of linkage arguments when\nindispensability can be shown.\n5.4 Rights to Do Wrong\n\nAre there rights to do wrong? Many have thought so. Waldron (1993, 63)\ngives the example of antiwar protesters organizing a rowdy\ndemonstration near a Remembrance Day service; Wellman (1997, 33)\noffers the illustration of edging into a checkout line with a full\ncart, just ahead of a tired woman carrying triplets. The puzzle is how\nthe positive normative force of \u201ca right\u201d can exist so\nclose to an opposed negative normative pole, \u201cwrong.\u201d In\nHohfeldian terms, how can there be a right (no duty not) to do what it\nis wrong (duty not) to do? (Similar questions arise about \u201cthe\nabuse of rights\u201d (Schauer 1984).)\n\nThere are two main readings of rights to do wrong. The first reading\ncharacterizes most rights as furthering the holder\u2019s autonomy.\nRights entitle their holders to make choices, and as Waldron (1993)\nsays the importance of a person\u2019s having choices would be\ndiminished if she were forced to do the right thing. Even though the\nperson has no (privilege-) right to perform an action that is wrong,\nit would nevertheless violate an important (claim-) right of hers for\nothers to compel her not to do that thing. To take the speech example,\nwe respect the autonomy of speakers when we allow them to speak\nunmolested\u2014even when they do wrong by expressing themselves in\ndisrespectful ways. (For a defense of this reading against objections\nfrom Galston and George, see Herstein 2012. On the existence and value\nof legal rights to do legal wrongs, see Herstein 2013.)\n\nThe second reading of rights to do wrong sees them as involving a\nmid-sentence shift in domains of reasons. There is no mystery, after\nall, in having a legal right to do something morally\nwrong. The potential for a legal right to do a moral wrong arises from\nthe fact that the domains of legal and moral reasons are not perfectly\noverlapped. One has a legal privilege to edge in front of the tired\nmother in the check-out line, but this is something that one has a\nmoral duty not to do. Similarly, one might have a moral privilege to\ndo what one has no customary privilege to do (a moral right to do a\ncustomary wrong), and so on. Each domain of reasons is distinct, and\nhowever conclusive are the reasons that any particular\nrights-assertion implies, these are only reasons within a single\ndomain of reasons (moral, or legal, or customary). Osiel (2019)\nexamines the sociology of stigmatization that encourages individuals\nand states not to exercise their legal rights in ways that violate\nmoral norms.\n\nA related question concerns how it can come to be permissible to treat\nA in certain ways that would, but for the actions or situation of A,\nbe wrong. For example, it is wrong purposefully to impose a hardship\non another person, unless that person has acted in a way that merits\npunishment. Wellman (2017) makes a close study of how it can be\npermissible to punish, concluding that the best explanation is that\nthe wrongdoer has forfeited her right against hard treatment. A\nseparate line of scholarship running through work by Thomson, McMahan,\nOtsuka, Frowe, and Lazar debates how it can be permissible to attack\ninnocents during war (see Walen 2019, 2\u20138).\n5.5 Rights to Believe, Feel, and Want\n\nMoral rights, legal rights, and customary rights all define domains of\nrights within the realm of rights of conduct: rights\nconcerning how agents may and should act. When our reasons\nwithin these three different domains conflict, we may have reasons of\ndifferent kinds to act in different ways. Yet there are also rights\nentirely beyond the realm of conduct. These are rights to\nbelieve, to feel and to want. For example,\nthe prime minister asserts that he had a right to believe what his\nadvisors told him. The artist says she has a right to feel angry at\nher critics. The frustrated suburbanite complains he has a right to\nwant more out of life.\n\nThe realm of rights of rights to believe, to feel, and to want are the\nrealms of epistemic, of affective, and of\nconative rights. Together with the realm of rights of\nconduct, these are the four realms of rights. Each of these four\nrealms of rights defines a separate conceptual space: there are no\nepistemic rights to act, and no affective rights to believe. What is\ndistinctive about the three realms of rights beyond the rights of\nconduct is that they seem only to contain only privilege-rights (Wenar\n2003). One may, for example, have a privilege-right to believe what\none\u2019s eyes tell one, and a privilege-right to feel proud of what\none has done. It is interesting to consider why these epistemic,\naffective, and conative realms contain no claims, powers, or\nimmunities.\n\nPhilosophers have long been interested in epistemic rights in\nparticular (Altschul 2010 (Other Internet Resources), Graham and\nPedersen 2012), though there is also skepticism about this category\n(Glick 2010). William James, for instance, calls The Will to\nBelieve, \u201can essay in justification of faith, a defense of\nour right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matters, in spite\nof the fact that our merely logical intellect may not have been\ncoerced.\u201d James\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d conclusion in the\nessay is that \u201cwe have the right to believe at our own risk any\nhypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will\u201d (James 1897,\n2, 29). Similarly, the deepest questions in Kant\u2019s philosophy\nare framed in terms of rights. In the Critique of Pure\nReason, the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories aims to\nprove the validity of the employment of the concepts of pure\nunderstanding. In the Critique of Practical Reason, the\nDeduction of Freedom aims to demonstrate our entitlement to regard\nourselves as free. In both Deductions, the central question is\na quaestio iuris: \u201cBy what right?\u201d Kant\u2019s\nquestions are: By what right do we employ the categories; and by what\nright do we think of ourselves as free?\n6. Three Approaches to the Justification of Rights\n\nThere are two leading philosophical approaches to explaining which\nfundamental rights of conduct there are, and why these rights should\nbe respected. These two approaches are broadly identifiable as\ndeontological and consequentialist. Status theories hold that human\nbeings have attributes that make it fitting to ascribe certain rights\nto them, and make respect for these rights appropriate. Instrumental\ntheories hold that respect for particular rights is a means for\nbringing about some optimal distribution of advantages. Each approach\nhas characteristic strengths and weaknesses; the long-running contest\nbetween them is ongoing.\n\nQuinn (1993, 170) sketches a modern status theory this way:\n\n\nA person is constituted by his body and his mind. They are parts or\naspects of him. For that very reason, it is fitting that he have\nprimary say over what may be done to them\u2014not because such an\narrangement best promotes overall human welfare, but because any\narrangement that denied him that say would be a grave indignity. In\ngiving him this authority, morality recognizes his existence as an\nindividual with ends of his own\u2014an independent being.\nSince that is what he is, he deserves this recognition.\n\n\nQuinn claims that there is some attribute of the person\u2014here,\nbeing \u201can individual with ends of his own\u201d\u2014that\nmerits recognition from others. The recognition that is due to each\nindividual can be accorded to that individual by respecting his\nfundamental rights.\n\nQuinn contrasts his status approach to rights with one that ascribes\nrights \u201cbecause such an arrangement best promotes overall human\nwelfare.\u201d His target is consequentialist theories of rights, the\nparadigm of which are utilitarian theories. We met such a utilitarian\ntheory of rights above in John Stuart Mill\u2019s conceptualization\nof rights as \u201csomething which society ought to defend me in the\npossession of.\u201d Mill believed that society ought to defend the\nindividual in possession of her rights because doing so would bring\nabout the greatest utility summed across the members of that society.\nFor Mill, as for other instrumental theorists, rights are a tool for\nproducing an optimal distribution of interests across some group.\n\nThe two approaches differ sharply over the role of consequences in the\njustification of ascribing rights. Status theorists hold that rights\nshould be respected because it is fitting to do so, and not because of\nthe good consequences that will flow from so doing. By contrast,\nwithin an instrumental theory good consequences are the justification\nfor promulgating and enforcing rights. As Quinn (1993, 173) says about\nthe status approach:\n\n\nIt is not that we think it fitting to ascribe rights because we think\nit is a good thing that rights be respected. Rather we think respect\nfor rights a good thing precisely because we think people actually\nhave them\u2014and\u2026 that they have them because it is fitting\nthat they should.\n\n\nWithin a status approach, rights are not means for the promotion of\ngood consequences. They are rather, in Nozick\u2019s phrase, side\nconstraints on the pursuit of good consequences (Nozick 1974,\n29). A status approach frowns on any rights violation, even for the\nsake of maximizing the non-violation of rights overall (as in a\n\u201cutilitarianism of rights\u201d). Such an approach emphasizes\nthe \u201cagent-relative\u201d reasons that each person has to avoid\nviolating the rights of others.\n\nA status-based justification thus begins with the nature of the\nrightholder and arrives immediately at the right. The instrumental\napproach starts with the desired consequences (like maximum utility)\nand works backward to see which rights-ascriptions will produce those\nconsequences.\n6.1 Status-Based Rights\n\nStatus theories belong to the tradition of natural rights theories.\nAll natural rights theories fix upon features that humans have by\ntheir nature, which make respect for certain rights appropriate. The\ntheories differ over precisely which attributes of humans give rise to\nrights, although non-religious theories tend to fix upon the same\nsorts of attributes described in more or less metaphysical or\nmoralized terms: free will, rationality, autonomy, or the ability to\nregulate one\u2019s life in accordance with one\u2019s chosen\nconception of the good life. Natural rights theorists agree that human\nreason can grasp the fact that it is appropriate to treat beings with\nsuch attributes in certain ways, although they disagree on whether\nsuch facts are self-evident.\n\nNatural rights theory reached its high point in the early modern era,\nin the work of Grotius, Hobbes, Pufendorf, and especially Locke. Locke\nargued that men have rights to \u201clife, liberty, and estate\u201d\nin a pre-political state of nature, and that these natural rights put\nlimits on the legitimate authority of the state. Locke\u2019s\ninfluence can be seen in the revolutionary American and French\npolitical documents of the eighteenth century, and especially in\nJefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence (1776): \u201cWe hold\nthese truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that\nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,\nthat among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of\nHappiness.\u201d\n\nThe revival of status theory within contemporary philosophy began with\nNozick\u2019s Anarchy State and Utopia (1974). While Nozick\ndoes acknowledge a debt to Locke\u2019s theory of property, his work\nbelongs within the Kantian tradition of natural rights theorizing.\nNozick centers his explanation of the moral force of individual rights\non the Kantian imperative against treating humanity merely as a means\nto an end. Each person\u2019s rights impose side-constraints on\nothers\u2019 pursuit of their goals, Nozick says, because each person\npossesses an inviolability that all others must respect.\n\u201cIndividuals have rights,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand there are\nthings no person or group may do to them (without violating their\nrights)\u201d (Nozick 1974, ix).\n\nMany find this approach of grounding of rights in individual dignity\nappealing. There is a directness and clarity to status explanations of\nfundamental rights. For example, Kamm (2007, 247) explains the right\nof free expression as follows:\n\n\nThe right to speak may simply be the only appropriate way to treat\npeople with minds of their own and the capacity to use means to\nexpress it\u2026 Not recognizing a person\u2019s option of speaking is\nto fail to respect him\u2026 To say that any given person is not entitled\nto the strong right to free speech is\u2026 a way of saying that certain\ncrucial features of human nature are not sufficient to generate the\nright in anyone. And this seems to be a mistake.\n\n\nMoreover, status-based rights are attractively robust. While the\njustifications of instrumental rights are always contingent on\ncalculations concerning consequences, status-based rights are anchored\nfirmly in individual dignity. This makes it easy to explain why\nstatus-based rights are strong, almost unqualified rights, and this is\na position which many believe properly expresses the great value of\neach person.\n\nHowever, the strength of status-based rights can also be seen as a\nweakness of the theory. One does not wish to be carried from the great\nimportance of each individual to the implausible position that all\nfundamental rights are absolute. As Nagel (2002, 36) allows while\ndefending a status view, \u201cthere are evils great enough so that\none would be justified in murdering or torturing an innocent person to\nprevent them.\u201d Consequences, if bad enough, do justify the\nqualification of individual rights, which leaves the status theorist\nneeding to explain how a theory which rejects consequences so\nresolutely at the outset can concede their importance later on.\n\nMoreover, the simplicity of the status approach to rights can also\nappear to be a liability. On close examination, the fundamental rights\nthat most people believe in are intricately \u201cshaped.\u201d For\nexample, consider the widely-accepted right to free expression. This\nright includes the right to make damning personal attacks on others.\nYet the right is much more permissive about attacking public figures\nthan it is about assailing private citizens. How could a status\napproach explain this distinction between public figures and private\ncitizens? Or again: the right to free speech sometimes contains a\nright to say what the speaker knows to be untrue. Yet we tend to be\nmore tolerant of deceitful speech in political campaigns than we are\nof deceitful speech in advertising or in the courtroom. It is an open\nquestion whether status theory has the conceptual resources to explain\nwhy individual rights should be shaped in these specific ways.\n\nStatus theory also faces the challenge of vindicating its foundations\nand its scope. Why after all is it \u201cfitting\u201d to ascribe\nindividuals rights? The Kantian value of inviolability can look\npuzzling when presented independently of a metaphysical grounding. As\nNagel (2002, 34) admits, \u201cit has proven extremely difficult to\naccount for such a basic, individualized value such that it becomes\nmorally intelligible.\u201d This is a quiet echo of Bentham\u2019s\nprotest that the doctrine of natural rights \u201cis from beginning\nto end so much flat assertion: it lays down as a fundamental and\ninviolable principle whatever is in dispute\u201d (Bentham 1796, 66).\nCruft (2010, 451) has attempted to deepen the theory of the\nnon-instrumental value of basic rights, by showing that such rights\nare constitutive of \u201crelationships that bind all humans together\nin fellowship as members of a shared-proto-community.\u201d\n\nEven so, status theorists must also resolve an internal debate over\nexactly which rights should be thought to express an\nindividual\u2019s inviolability. Nozick holds that status-based\nrights include rights to whatever property one has acquired, while\nother status theorists reject the \u201cright libertarianism\u201d\nto which Nozick\u2019s position leads. The resolution of this debate\nbecame more urgent when a group of neo-Kantian and neo-Lockean\n\u201cleft libertarian\u201d theorists have advanced the view that\nthe status of individuals requires that each be accorded strong rights\nto self-ownership, and also initially equal shares of\n\u201cworld-ownership\u201d (Vallentyne and Steiner 2000, Otsuka\n2003). Status theories also need to pay particular attention to the\nrights that society should enforce in cases of widespread\nnon-compliance with \u201cideal\u201d rights (Quong and Stone\n2015).\n6.2 Instrumental Rights\n\nInstrumental theories see rights as instruments for achieving an\noptimal distribution of advantages. The archetypal instrumental theory\nis some form of two-level consequentialism, such as rule\nutilitarianism. Within such a theory, rights are rules the general\nobservance of which will lead to an optimal distribution of\nadvantages. In rule utilitarianism, the optimal distribution is the\none that contains the greatest aggregate utility.\n\nThe most common objection to grounding rights in such a theory is that\nthe resulting rights will be too flimsy. If rights are justified only\ninsofar as they generate good consequences, it may seem that the\ntheory will need to prune its rights, perhaps severely, whenever\nmaximum utility lies elsewhere. Why is it not a rule in a two-level\nsystem, for example, that one should frame an innocent man if this\nwould prevent a major riot? Why should it not be a rule that one\nshould \u201cviolate\u201d the right of an innocent not to be killed\nif this would prevent the killings of two innocents elsewhere? While\nstatus-based rights can appear to be too strong, instrumental rights\ncan appear to be too weak. (See Pettit 1988 for a\ncounter-argument.)\n\nWeak rights are a problem for utilitarianism because its focus on\nmaximization makes it indifferent to certain facts about how utility\nis distributed across individuals. However, utilitarianism is not the\nonly kind of instrumental theory. \n\nFor example, a pure egalitarian theory will portray rights as\ninstruments for achieving a more equal distribution of advantages. A\nprioritarian theory will define an optimal distribution in a manner\nsimilar to egalitarianism, except that it will give extra weight to\nthe interests of those worse off. Other instrumental theories\ncharacterize \u201coptimal distribution\u201d in other ways (Sumner\n1987, 171). Instrumental theories that do not define an optimal\ndistribution in terms of maximization may face less pressure than\nutilitarianism does from concerns about weak rights (Scanlon\n1977).\n\nInstrumental theories differ over how they define what counts as an\noptimal distribution (maximization, equality, etc.). They also differ\nin how they measure individual advantage. For instance, a\nutilitarian\u2019s metric is utility, Sen works with a metric of\ncapabilities, Dworkin with resources, and so on.\n\nWhatever metric they use, all instrumental theorists will have to\naddress longstanding questions about the commensurability and\ninterpersonal comparison of interests. Since instrumental theorists\nwork with overall evaluations of how well off individuals would be\nwere certain rights ascribed, they must explain how distinct\ncategories of interests (e.g., health, income, opportunities for\nself-expression, social recognition) trade off against one another.\nThey must also explain why they believe that these interests are\nsimilar enough across persons that it makes sense to use the same\nscales of measurement for different persons (Griffin 1989).\n\nStatus theories are subject to the objection that they lack the\nconceptual resources to explain why the rights we believe in are\nintricately \u201cshaped\u201d to accommodate the particularities of\ndifferent contexts and different rightholders. Instrumental theories\nare vulnerable to the mirror-image objection. An instrumental theorist\ncan appeal to any number of distinct interests, which are at stake for\nany number of differently-situated individuals, to explain why a\ncertain right should be held only by certain persons or only in\ncertain circumstances. The danger for such a theorist is that the\nwealth of normative resources at her command will permit the\nascription of whatever rights she favors. The theorist begins with the\nrights that she wants to justify, then gives a \u201cjust so\u201d\nstory in terms of an optimal distribution of interests that leads to\nexactly those rights (Tushnet 1984, Frey 1985). Moreover all\ninstrumental justifications rely on empirical predictions concerning\nwhich ascriptions of rights would produce which consequences, and\nthere will typically be enough slack in these empirical predictions\nfor instrumental theorists to fudge their derivations in order to\nreach the desired rights.\n\nBoth status theories and instrumental theories of rights have held a\nperennial attraction. Because of this, many have been tempted to\nsearch for a hybrid approach that would combine what is plausible in\neach (e.g., Sen, 1982).\n6.3 Contractual and Justificatory Rights\n\nA third approach to the justification of rights might be called\n\u201ccontractual.\u201d Here rights are characterized neither as\nnaturally fitting for independent beings nor as tools to promote the\nbest state of affairs. Rather, rights define principles that would be\nchosen by properly situated and motivated agents agreeing to the basic\nterms of their relations (e.g., principles chosen in Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position, or principles within Scanlon\u2019s contractualism\nthat no one could reasonably reject). The fact that these principles\nwould be agreed to under the specified conditions is their\njustification.\n\nThe rights that define fundamental principles within these theories\nare phrased in terms of what the theories\u2019 agents have strong\nreason to want. So, for example, Rawls states that the role of a\ncitizen\u2019s right of personal property \u201cis to allow a\nsufficient material basis for a sense of personal independence and\nself-respect, both of which are essential for the development and\nexercise of the two moral powers\u201d (Rawls 1993, 298). And Scanlon\nsays that reasonable individuals \u201chave reason to insist \u2026 on\nbasic rights, which give them important forms of protection and\ncontrol over their own lives\u201d (Scanlon 2003, 4).\n\nForst (2012, 2014, 2016) combines critical and contractualist theory\ninto a sophisticated account of rights. Beginning with a status-based\nfundamental right to justification, he shows how suitably idealized\ndemands for justification from individuals subordinated within real\nrelations of power can ground specific rights to relief from and\nredress for actual injustices. Forst\u2019s framework shows the\nenduring theoretical appeal and practical potential of the Kantian\ntradition of understanding rights.\n7. Critiques of Rights\n\nCritiques of rights come in two forms. The first is an attack on the\nsubstance of doctrines that give rights a central place. These\ncritiques allege that the content of such doctrines is, in one way or\nother, malformed or unjustified. Here we find, for example, the\ncriticism that natural rights doctrines are \u201cso much flat\nassertion,\u201d or that utilitarian rights tend to be implausibly\nweak. The second form of critique attacks the language of rights\nitself. The objection here is that it is inappropriate or\ncounterproductive to express at least some kinds of normative concerns\nin terms of rights. We should, according to the second form of\ncritique, reduce or avoid \u201crights talk.\u201d\n7.1 Critiques of Rights Doctrine\n\nMarx attacked the substance of the revolutionary eighteenth century\nAmerican and French political documents that proclaimed the\nfundamental \u201crights of man\u201d: liberty, equality, security,\nproperty, and the free exercise of religion. Marx objected that these\nalleged rights derive from a false conception of the human individual\nas unrelated to others, as having interests can be defined without\nreference to others, and as always potentially in conflict with\nothers. The rights-bearing individual is an \u201cisolated\nmonad\u2026 withdrawn behind his private interests and whims and\nseparated from the community\u201d (Marx 1844, 146).\n\nThe right of property, Marx asserted, exemplifies the isolating and\nanti-social character of these alleged rights of man. On the one hand,\nthe right of property is the right to keep others at a distance: the\nlegal equivalent of a barbed wire fence. On the other hand, the right\nof property allows an owner to transfer his resources at his own\npleasure and for his own gain, without regard even for the desperate\nneed for those resources elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, Marx held that the much-celebrated individual right to\nliberty reinforces selfishness. Those who are ascribed the right to do\nwhat they wish so long as they do not hurt others will perpetuate a\nculture of egoistic obsession. As for equality, the achievement of\nequal rights in a liberal state merely distracts people from noticing\nthat their equality is purely formal: a society with formally equal\nrights will continue to be divided by huge inequalities in economic\nand political power. Finally, these so-called \u201cnatural\u201d\nrights are in fact not natural to humans at all. They are simply the\ndefining elements of the rules of the modern mode of production,\nperfectly suited to fit each individual into the capitalist\nmachine.\n\nCommunitarians (Taylor, Walzer, MacIntyre, Sandel) sound several of\nthe same themes in their criticisms of contemporary liberal and\nlibertarian theories. The communitarians object that humans are not,\nas such theories assume, \u201cantecedently individuated.\u201d\nNozick\u2019s \u201cstate of nature\u201d theorizing, for example,\nerrs in presuming that individuals outside of a stable, state-governed\nsocial order will develop the autonomous capacities that make them\ndeserving of rights. Nor should we attempt, as in Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position, to base an argument for rights on what individuals\nwould choose in abstraction from their particular identities and\ncommunity attachments. There is no way to establish a substantive\npolitical theory on what all rational agents want in the abstract.\nRather, theorists should look at the particular social contexts in\nwhich real people live their lives, and to the meanings that specific\ngoods carry within different cultures. This communitarian critique\ncontinues by accusing liberal and libertarian theories of being\nfalsely universalistic, in insisting that all societies should bend\nthemselves to fit within a standard-sized grid of rights. Insofar as\nwe should admit rights into our understanding of the world at all,\ncommunitarians say, we should see them as part of ongoing practices of\nsocial self-interpretation and negotiation\u2014 and so as rules that\ncan vary significantly between cultures.\n\nThese kinds of criticisms have been discussed in detail (e.g., Gutmann\n1985, Waldron 1987b, Mulhall and Swift 1992). Their validity turns on\nweighty issues in moral and political theory. What can be said here is\nthat a common theme in most of these criticisms\u2014that prominent\nrights doctrines are in some way excessively individualistic or\n\u201catomistic\u201d\u2014need not cut against any theory merely\nbecause it uses the language of rights. Ignatieff (2003, 67)\nerrs, for example, when he charges that \u201crights language cannot\nbe parsed or translated into a nonindividualistic, communitarian\nframework. It presumes moral individualism and is nonsensical outside\nthat assumption.\u201d\n\nAs we saw above, the language of rights is able to accommodate\nrightholders who are individuals as such, but also individuals\nconsidered as members of groups, as well as groups themselves, states,\npeoples, and so on. Indeed the non-individualistic potential of\nrights-language is more than a formal possibility. The doctrine of\ninternational human rights\u2014the modern cousin of eighteenth\ncentury natural rights theory\u2014ascribes several significant\nrights to groups. The international Convention against Genocide, for\nexample, forbids actions intending to destroy any national, ethnic,\nracial or religious group; and both of the human rights Covenants\nascribe to peoples the right to self-determination. Such examples show\nthat the language of rights is not individualistic in its essence.\n7.2 Critiques of the Language of Rights\n\nThe language of rights can resist the charge that it is necessarily\ncomplicit with individualism. However, critics have accused rights\ntalk of impeding social progress:\n\n\nOur rights talk, in its absoluteness promotes unrealistic\nexpectations, heightens social conflict, and inhibits dialogue that\nmight lead toward consensus, accommodation, or at least the discovery\nof common ground. In its silence concerning responsibilities, it seems\nto condone acceptance of the benefits of living in a democratic social\nwelfare state, without accepting the corresponding personal and civic\nobligations\u2026. In its insularity, it shuts out potentially\nimportant aids to the process of self-correcting learning. All of\nthese traits promote mere assertion over reason-giving.\n\n\nGlendon (1991, 14) here draws out some of the detrimental practical\nconsequences of the connection between rights and conclusive reasons\nthat we saw above. Since rights assertions suggest conclusive reasons,\npeople can be tempted to assert rights when they want to end a\ndiscussion instead of continuing it. One plays a right as a trump card\nwhen one has run out of arguments. Similarly, the ready availability\nof rights language may lead parties initially at odds with each other\ntoward confrontation instead of negotiation, as each side escalates an\narms-race of rights assertions that can only be resolved by a superior\nauthority like a court. One line of feminist theory has picked up on\nthis line of criticism, identifying the peremptory and rigidifying\ndiscourse of rights with the confrontational masculine\n\u201cvoice\u201d (Gilligan 1993).\n\nIt is not inevitable that these unfortunate tendencies will afflict\nthose who make use of the language of rights. As we have seen, it may\nbe plausible to hold that each right is \u201cabsolute\u201d only\nwithin an elaborately gerrymandered area. And it may be possible to\nproduce deep theories to justify why one has the rights that one\nasserts. However, it is plausible that the actual use of rights talk\ndoes have the propensities that Glendon suggests. It seems no accident\nthat America, \u201cthe land of rights,\u201d is also the land of\nlitigation.\n\nAnother deleterious consequence of rights talk that Glendon picks out\nis its tendency to move the moral focus toward persons as\nrightholders, instead of toward persons as bearers of\nresponsibilities. This critique is developed by O\u2019Neill (1996,\n127\u201353; 2002, 27\u201334). A focus on rightholders steers moral\nreasoning toward the perspective of recipience, instead of toward the\ntraditional active ethical questions of what one ought to do and how\none ought to live. Rights talk also leads those who use it to neglect\nimportant virtues such as courage and beneficence, which are duties to\nwhich no rights correspond. Finally, the use of rights language\nencourages people to make impractical demands, since one can assert a\nright without attending to the desirability or even the possibility of\nburdening others with the corresponding obligations.\n\nCriticisms such as O\u2019Neill\u2019s do not target the language of\nrights as a whole. They aim squarely at the passive rights, and\nespecially at claim-rights, instead of at the active privileges and\npowers. Nevertheless, it is again plausible that the spread of rights\ntalk has encouraged the tendencies that these criticisms suggest. The\nmodern discourse of rights is characteristically deployed by those who\nsee themselves or others as potential recipients, entitled to insist\non certain benefits or protections.\n\nDescribing fundamental norms in terms of rights has benefits as well\nas dangers (Schneider 1986, Ackerly 2013). The language of rights can\ngive precise expression to elaborate structures of freedom and\nauthority. When embodied in particular doctrines, such as in the\ninternational human rights documents, the language of rights can\nexpress in accessible terms the standards for minimally acceptable\ntreatment that individuals can demand from those with power over them.\nRights are also associated with historical movements for greater\nliberty and equality, so assertions of rights in pursuit of justice\ncan carry a resonance that other appeals lack. Whether these benefits\nof using rights language overbalance the hazards remains a live\nquestion in moral, political, and legal theory.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackerly, B., 2013, \u201cFeminist and Activist Approaches to\nHuman Rights,\u201d in M.
