They\nhave the liberty to make decisions on behalf of their children\nregarding matters such as diet, schooling, association with others,\nand\u2014more controversially\u2014religious observance, and the\nright to exclude others from such decision-making. Such rights\ndecrease in strength and scope as children gain decision-making\ncapacity, yet until the child reaches moral or legal competence,\nissues of substituted judgment and surrogate decision-making remain\n(Ross 2002).\n\nParental rights\u2019 content, extent, and relation to parental\nobligations is determined by the underlying theory of why parents\npossess such rights. On the child-centered or fiduciary model,\nparental rights piggyback on parental responsibilities to children,\nwhich are morally fundamental. One such theory is Blustein\u2019s\n\u201cpriority thesis.\u201d According to the priority thesis,\nparents acquire rights in order to carry out their responsibilities;\nthus responsibilities are morally prior to rights (Blustein 1982,\n104\u2013114). As Archard writes, \u201cA parent can choose for his\nchild, and exclude others from the making of these choices, only in\nthe service of and thus constrained by a duty to care for the child.\nIt is in the first instance because a dependent child must have\ndecisions made for it that a designated parent is entitled to make\nthose decisions.\u201d (Archard 2010, 108; see also Brennan and\nNoggle 1997; Austin 2007).\n\nOther theories of parental rights focus on parents\u2019 interests.\nHistorically, parenthood has often been regarded as a possessory (or\nproprietary) relationship. Some genetic accounts of parenthood imply\nthe proprietarian view that parents own their children (see 4.1; Hall\n1999; Narveson 2002). However, property rights seem inappropriate here\nfor several reasons: children cannot be sold and they cannot be used\nhowever the parent wishes. While it might be responded that parental\nproperty rights are limited, prohibiting sale and certain uses, this\ndoes not address the more fundamental objection that persons cannot be\nproperty.\n\nOther theories provide more plausible support for parent-centered, as\nopposed to child-centered, accounts of parental rights in terms of\nparents\u2019 interests. Brighouse and Swift argue for parental\nrights on the basis of the irreplaceable good offered by parenting.\nBecause parenting is a project with goods which cannot be obtained\nthrough other activities, such as the responsibility of caring for a\nchild and the receipt of children\u2019s spontaneous trust,\naffection, and intimacy, the interest in parenting should be\nprotected. On this account, parental rights, not parental obligations,\nare fundamental, because the parents\u2019 interests are the basis\nfor the right (Brighouse and Swift 2006, 2014; see also Shoeman 1980).\nOne line of objection is to ask whether the interest in parenting is\nlikely to be undermined by state intervention in parental\ndecision-making. Here we can usefully distinguish at least three\ndifferent kinds of parental interests which could ground parental\nrights to control aspects of their children\u2019s lives: interests\nin being a fiduciary, interests in intimacy, and interests in\n\u201cnurturing, counseling, and education.\u201d Intimacy and being\na fiduciary, which Brighouse and Swift appeal to, arguably need not be\nundermined by intervention \u2013 whereas an interest in\nauthentically nurturing children into adults might (Altman 2018).\n\nThe parental-interest account of parents\u2019 rights addresses\nproblems raised within political philosophy for the family. Brighouse\nand Swift generate their account partly in response to the challenge\nof redistribution of children: if the state should promote child\nwelfare, why should children not be redistributed at birth to the best\nprospective parents, to maximize children\u2019s welfare? But as\nGheaus points out, while Brighouse and Swift provide an account of\nfundamental parental rights, they do not explain why biological\nparents have rights to rear their biological children, rather than\nsuch children being redistributed to better prospective parents, who\ncould thereby undertake their own parenting projects (Gheaus 2012).\nOne response to this concern is to separate the question of how\nsomeone obtains parental rights (the topic of the previous section)\nfrom the question of whose interests\u2014parent, child, or\nboth\u2014those rights ultimately protect (Millum 2017). Brighouse\nand Swift also aim to address the family\u2019s notorious effect on\nequal opportunity \u2013 different parenting practices, such as\nreading bedtime stories, can greatly affect children\u2019s life\nchances. On their account, certain inequality-producing institutions\nsuch as private schools and inheritances are not protected under\nparents\u2019 rights \u2013 but practices essential to\nparents\u2019 interest in intimacy, such as bedtime stories, are.\n(For a reply, see Engster 2019.) Finally, a dual-interest view,\ngrounding rights in interests of both parents and children, is also\npossible (Macleod 2015).\n\nOne question concerning parental rights is their strength. Parental\nrights entitle parents to exclude others, including the state, from\nchild-rearing decisions. For critics, the absolute exclusivity typical\nof contemporary western nuclear families gives parents too much power\nover the vulnerable children in their care (Card 1996, Gheaus 2011;\nsee also Gheaus 2018b).\n\nAn important set of questions about the content of parental rights\nconcerns their scope. While it is widely agreed that parents have\nrights to make many day-to-day decisions on behalf of their children,\na number of purported rights have been questioned.\n\nOne controversial right is the right to infuse children with\nparents\u2019 religious beliefs. On the one hand, handing down such\nbeliefs to children is, to many, a key aspect of the parental project\n(Brighouse and Swift 2006, 2014; Galston 2011). On the other hand,\nClayton argues that raising one\u2019s child in a religion violates a\nrequirement of liberal neutrality, which applies to parents just as it\napplies to states (Clayton 2006; also Coleman 2003). From a feminist\nperspective, Okin argued that religious infusion could affect\ngirls\u2019 developing self-respect and equal opportunity (Okin 1994;\ncf. Chambers 2017, Chapter 6; Schouten 2017). Even if such arguments\ntheoretically justify state intervention, their proponents must\nexplain how, in practice, the state could intervene in the intimate\nparent-child relationship without psychologically harming\nchildren.\n\nAnother set of questions concerns parental authority over medical\ninterventions. Critics have argued that circumcision of male children\nviolates their bodily integrity; but children\u2019s rights to bodily\nintegrity must be weighed against other morally weighty interests,\nincluding the child\u2019s own interest in community membership\n(Benatar and Benatar 2003, Mazor 2019). Likewise, there is controversy\nover whether parents should have the right to prevent transgender\nadolescents from receiving puberty-blocking treatment; here, harm to\ntransgender children must be weighed (Priest 2019). In such conflicts,\nthere are tensions between parental control rights and\nchildren\u2019s rights, but also between different understandings of\nwhat the child\u2019s best interests require (particularly when the\nchild lacks decision-making capacity). (See entry on\n children\u2019s rights.)\n\nA related debate concerns the authority of parents to control their\nchild\u2019s education. Most discussion of this issue has focused on\nreligion-based objections to the duration or content of public\nschooling. This was the context in which Feinberg originally discussed\nthe child\u2019s \u201cright to an open future,\u201d which he\nregards as a constraint on parental discretion regarding their\nchild\u2019s schooling (1980, see below for further discussion). A\nkey challenge is how to justify these objections. One strategy is to\ncite the parents\u2019 right to freedom of religion, but then some\nargument must be given for why the apparent interests of a child in\nbeing educated should be sacrificed to their religious freedom. A\nseparate question regarding parental rights and education is whether\nparents are ethically permitted to confer advantages on their children\nthrough private schooling, particularly when doing so is expected to\nreduce the quality of education available to other children (Swift\n2003).\n\nOther questions concerning parental rights concern exclusivity and the\nnumber of possible parents. As step-parenting, procreation involving\nmultiple biological, gestational, and social parents, and other\ndiverse family forms become more prevalent, why should the number of\nparents be limited to two? As noted in Section 1 above, a Canadian\ncourt recognized a child as having three parents. Relatives in\naddition to the parents are frequently involved in raising children,\neven in cultures in which the nuclear family is considered the norm.\nIn the United States, nearly 3 million grandparents have primary\nresponsibility for children living in their homes and it has been\nargued that grandparental rights should be legally recognized\n(Henderson 2005). Further, some philosophers have argued for legal\nrecognition or support for non-parental care, as in, for example,\nAfrican-American practices of \u201cothermothering\u201d or\n\u201crevolutionary parenting.\u201d This would permit more adults\nto contribute to children\u2019s development, thereby arguably\nbenefiting children (Card 1996; Gheaus 2011 and 2019; hooks 1984;\nCollins 1991; Mullin 2005; see also\n 3.5\n above).\n\nSo far, we have considered parental rights as parents\u2019 moral and\nlegal claims to make, and exclude others from, decisions regarding\ntheir child. But some philosophers have argued for other rights held\nby parents\u2014namely, positive rights to social support for\nchild-rearing. These proposals are discussed in 5.2, as they aim at\nhelping parents discharge their responsibilities.\n",
