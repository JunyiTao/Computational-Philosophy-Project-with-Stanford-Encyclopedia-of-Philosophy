    "main_text": "Self-Ownership and Economic Justice\n1. Self-Ownership and Economic Justice\n\nThe publication of Robert Nozick\u2019s book, Anarchy, State, and\nUtopia (1974) was the first time mainstream academic philosophy\nwas forced to pay attention to libertarian ideas. Within philosophy,\ntherefore, libertarianism revolved heavily around this book\u2019s\nreception. G. A. Cohen was one of the most important of Nozick\u2019s\ncritics, but he nonetheless sympathized with what he took to be the\ncore commitment of justice in Nozick\u2019s theory \u2013\nself-ownership. He therefore made the connection between\nself-ownership and libertarian views regarding economic justice the\ncentral area of problematization, and the literature developed for\nsome decades in that way.\n\nSelf-ownership is the idea that all individuals have ownership rights\nover themselves, and therefore may do whatever they choose with\nthemselves so long as they do not violate the self-ownership of\nothers. Nozick believed, following Locke, that natural property rights\nover our own person could ground natural private property rights\nbeyond the person, and therefore indicate that a market-based economic\nsystem is just. Cohen, however, took it that self-ownership explained\nthe unjustly exploitative nature of capitalism. Following Karl Marx,\nCohen supposed that capitalists expropriate the fruits of\nworker\u2019s labour\u2014something that naturally belongs to the\nworker herself. Despite Nozick only mentioning self-ownership once,\nand developing a large number of arguments against redistributive\nconceptions of economic justice which do not explicitly invoke or rely\non the idea of self-ownership throughout part II of Anarchy,\nState, and Utopia, self-ownership became synonymous with\nlibertarianism.\n\nSelf-ownership means that individuals have a very stringent (perhaps\nthe most stringent possible) set of rights over their persons, giving\nthem the kind of control over themselves that one has over possessions\none holds as private property. This includes (1) control\nrights over the use of the entity: both a liberty-right to use it\nand a claim-right that others not use it without one\u2019s consent,\n(2) rights to transfer these rights to others (by sale,\nrental, gift, or loan), (3) immunities to the non-consensual\nloss of these rights, (4) rights to compensation if\nsomeone uses the entity without one\u2019s permission, and (5)\nenforcement rights (including rights of prior restraint if\nsomeone is about to violate these rights). Central to this idea of\nself-ownership is the right to control ourselves, and to exclude\nothers from making use of us. Self-ownership, in other words,\noffers protections against others doing things to us against our will\n(unless it is our will to violate someone else\u2019s self-ownership,\nof course).\n\nThe idea of self-ownership is attractive for many reasons. We\nrecognize people as self-owners when we recognize that there are\nthings that may not be done to a person without their consent, but\nwhich may be done with consent. As such, it is a way of explaining the\nso-called \u201cmoral magic of consent\u201d (cf. Barnett 1986a,\nAlexander 1996, Hurd 1996). Thus, we consider rape wrong because it\ninvolves a body being used against the will of the person to whom it\nbelongs, but not because there\u2019s something inherently wrong with\nsexual intercourse. We consider assault wrong for similar reasons, but\nallow voluntary boxing matches. We consider slavery wrong, but allow\nconsensual employment. There are also more theoretical reasons for\nself-ownership\u2019s attraction. The principle is a strong\nendorsement of the moral importance and sovereignty of the individual,\nand it expresses the refusal to treat people as mere things to use or\ntrade off against each other. It expresses the liberal notion\n(asserted by John Rawls against utilitarianism) of the moral\n\u201cseparateness of persons\u201d (Zwolinski 2008).\n\nIn many contexts, self-ownership may be intuitively very attractive.\nIt offers, for instance, a straightforward and unequivocal\ncondemnation of chattel slavery. It grounds the defense of\nwomen\u2019s rights over their bodies, including the right to\nterminate unwanted pregnancies (Thomson 1971, Long 1993) It explains\nwhy it is wrong to sacrifice the rights and freedoms of minorities\n(even a minority of one) for the sake of protecting the interests of\nthe majority. It offers a principled objection to paternalism. And so\non.\n\nSelf-ownership does, however, crowd out other moral considerations,\nincluding ones that are often thought relevant to justice. For\nexample, it rules out the view that individuals have an enforceable\nduty to come to the assistance of others, if when they are in serious\nor urgent need (accept as a result of prior wrongdoing). For persons\nto have such an enforceable duty would be for it to be, in principle,\njustified for A to threaten B with force in order to\nget her to assist C (C being in need of assistance).\nHowever, this threat of force would involve a violation of\nB\u2019s self-ownership by A, since\nB\u2019s self-ownership includes a right to exclude others\nfrom taking control of her body and her actions without her consent.\nAny inclusion of enforceable, positive duties will remove much of the\nprotective content of self-ownership (see Flanigan 2018).\n\nAn implication of this is that taxation for the purposes of giving\nassistance to other members of society is ruled out. Nozick argued\nthat since taxation siphons off part of people\u2019s earnings, which\nrepresent people\u2019s labor, and people initially have the right\nnot to be forced to work for certain ends. Therefore, Nozick argued,\nredistributive taxation is morally on a par with forced labor (1974,\nch. 7). Self-ownership does not say that is something wrong with\ncoming to the assistance of others, nor even necessarily with\nrelations of dependence. But it does say there is something very wrong\nwith using force to get people to provide such assistance or to enter\ninto such relations.\n\nNozick\u2019s point was that theories of economic justice face a\nchoice. One can (a) respect people as the primary controllers of their\nlives, labor, and bodies. This means working for whomever they want,\non the terms they consent to, and deciding for themselves what is to\nbe done with the fruits of their labour. Recognizing this leaves no\nroom for a conception of economic justice that requires a particular\npattern of distribution. The composition of each individual\u2019s personal\nchoices as to how to contract with others will undo any given pattern\nof distribution the state seeks, and the state would have to deny\npeople their respective choices that lead to interruptions to the\npattern. Or one can (b) endorse the enforcement of certain\ndistributions. But in that case, the theory must endorse taking what\npeople innocently produce through their own labor, redirecting their\nwork to purposes they did not freely choose. This latter option is\nunacceptable to anyone endorsing the idea of self-ownership. As Nozick\nwrote, it involves claiming a kind of control over the lives of others\nthat is similar to a claim of ownership in them (1974, p. 172).\n\nNozick was also pointing to an incoherence within theories of\ndistributive justice. The point of distributing things to people is so\nthat they can enjoy the benefits of owning those things. Most\nimportantly, so they can, through their choices, use those things to\nimprove their lives. Invariably this will involve using them in\neconomic transactions. If a theory of distributive justice does not\npermit people to actually do the things they choose with what they\nhave, then it undermines the point in them having them at all. (Long\n2002, also see Schmidtz 2011)\n\nSelf-ownership is a key libertarian idea not just conceptually, but\nrhetorically. It demonstrates the central libertarian preoccupation\nwith showing that a commitment to personal or social liberty directly\nentails economic liberty in the form of private property and\ncontractual freedom \u2013 that economic and social liberty cannot be\nseparated, as post-war liberalism attempted to do.\n\nHowever, liberal egalitarians following Cohen\u2019s critique of the\nconnection between self-ownership and world-ownership that\nlibertarianism depends upon, were keen to separate the two. Seeking to\nsquare self-ownership and natural private property rights with\negalitarian distributive justice, Hillel Steiner, followed by Peter\nVallentyne and Michael Otsuka, developed a theory that endorsed\nself-ownership alongside an egalitarian principle of world-ownership.\nThis approach to distributive justice became known as\n\u201cleft-libertarianism\u201d\n(left-libertarianism2\u2014to be distinguished from\nleft-libertarianism1 that will be discussed below). The\ntraditional approach that did not put a distributive constraint on\nworld-ownership therefore came to be known as\n\u201cright-libertarianism1\u201d.\n\nOthers sought a similar theory of economic justice, but that did not\ndepend upon intuitions regarding the initial egalitarian ownership of\nthe external world. On these views, self-ownership, along with all\nproperty rights, can be split into control-rights and\nincome-rights. They argue that these two rights need not be\nattached; having the right to control the disposition of an object\ndoes not presuppose a right to recoup the entire value of the income\nstream the object\u2019s disposition generates. On this view the\nintuitive appeal of self-ownership (the control rights) can be\nendorsed whilst the income rights be subject to social distribution.\n(Gibbard 1976, Christman 1994) Such views depend upon self-ownership\nrights and property rights generally to be decomposable (Grey 1980,\nAttas 2006, also see Honor\u00e9 1961) which property essentialists\ndeny (Stern 2017). Whilst right-libertarians2 do not\nnecessarily deny that ownership is a bundle of logically distinct\nrights, they deny that control rights and income rights can be\nnormatively separated in this way (see Wheeler 1980, Rothbard 1982,\nMack 1990, and Long 2012 [Other Internet Resources]) indeed, this is\none the central tasks Nozick sets himself.\n\nAn internal issue is a debate over whether self-ownership may permit\nvoluntary enslavement. Agents have, on this view, not only the right\nto control the use of their person, but also the right to\ntransfer that right (e.g., by sale or gift) to others.\nHowever, this is controversial among libertarians, some of whom deny\nthat such transfers are possible because others cannot control\none\u2019s will. Whilst our rights of self-ownership can be\nwaived they cannot be permanently alienated (Epstein\n1973, 1979, Evers 1977, Rothbard 1982; Smith 1997, Barnett 1998a,\n1998b, pp. 78\u201382, Kinsella 1998/1999). Some argue that in order\nfor a right to an object to be transferred, it must be possible for\nour possession of the object to be de facto surrenderable\n(Evers 1977, Rothbard 1982). This is not the case with ourselves as we\nalways have privileged, agent-type control over ourselves, through\nwhich third parties must act if they wish to control us. Such a view\nof contractual transfer is compatible with labour contracts in general\nbut not specific-performance contracts in particular.\n\nTheorists who endorse the possibility of voluntary enslavement usually\nargue that self-ownership is a theory about the moral right to control\npermissible use (by giving or denying permission), not about the\npsychological capacity to control (Block 2003). Thus, similarly, the\nright to exercise one\u2019s autonomy is more fundamental\nthan the protection or promotion of one\u2019s autonomy over\ntime (Vallentyne 1998; Steiner 1994). Others argue that such a\ntransfer would undermine our autonomy (Grunebaum 1987), or reject the\npermissibility of such a transfer on theological grounds (Locke 1690,\nOlsthoorn, 2020).\n\nA second internal concern of self-ownership points out its restrictive\nimplications. Full self-ownership might seem to condemn as wrongful\neven very minor infringements of the personal sphere, such as when\ninnocuous particles of pollution fall upon an unconsenting person.\nProhibiting all acts that can lead to such minor infringements poses\nan unacceptable limit on our right to actually engage in\nactivities\u2014seemingly, to the very liberty self-ownership is\nsupposed to safeguard. But from the point of view of self-ownership,\nthere is no principled difference between minor infringements and\nmajor infringements. Whilst they may require different degrees of\nenforcement and compensation, both are equally morally prohibited.\nThus, this objection goes, self-ownership places such strong\nprotections for our liberty, it makes us mutually unable to act on our\nliberty. Thus, it must be rejected as motivationally incoherent\n(Railton 2003, Sobel 2012)\n\nThis objection, however, presupposes an implausible conception of\nself-ownership that its defenders need not endorse. Suppose we\nunderstand the moral benefits that self-ownership confers along two\ndimensions: protections from unwanted uses of our bodies, and\nliberties to use our bodies. As the objection points out, it is not\npossible to simultaneously maximize the value of both dimensions: our\nprotections restrict our liberties by restricting the possible uses of\none\u2019s body, and vice versa. Since maximizing the\nprotection-dimension implausibly restricts the use-dimension, the\ncorrect response is not to reject self-ownership, but rather to loosen\nthe protection-dimension somewhat in order to enhance the\nuse-dimension. Doing this would allow minor infringements for the sake\nof self-ownership. As Eric Mack (2015) puts it, a good theory of\nself-ownership offers people some \u201celbow room.\u201d This is\nenabled by ensuring that our claim-rights (whose purpose is to\nsafeguard the exercise of our liberty-rights) are not made stronger\nthan they need to be.\n\nMoreover, this critique seems to be deploying a notion of\nself-ownership few if any libertarians in fact endorse. Indeed, in\nCohen\u2019s critique of Nozick\u2019s libertarianism, he developed\nthe idea of \u201cfull\u201d self-ownership and ascribed this view\nto Nozick (1985, 1986, 1995). Full self-ownership is simply the\nlogically strongest set of ownership rights over oneself. But\nthere is no need for self-ownership to be as logically strong\nas is possible, it needs to be strong enough to safeguard the values\nand principles is expresses, and so-called full self-ownership does\nnot appear to do that, and hence few if any libertarians support\nit.\n\nIt is noteworthy that under the common law understanding of private\nproperty and nuisance, minor and insensible physical boundary\ncrossings that do not interfere with normal use and enjoyment of the\nproperty in question, are not considered violations of a right of\nownership. Given that ordinary private ownership rights do not give us\nthe right to exclude minor physical boundary-crossings in this way,\nsome argue there is no reason self-ownership should either. Moreover,\nit is not clear why a notion of self-ownership that does not include\nit should thereby be considered any less \u201cfull.\u201d\n(Christmas 2021c, pp.48\u201351)\n\nMaking modifications to full self-ownership may be necessary to make\nit a plausible principle and to make it coherent alongside other\nvalues. This threatens the status of self-ownership as a foundational\nprinciple in libertarian theory. Presumably, foundational principles\nare not based on underlying values. For many libertarians, this is not\nmuch of a concession, however. If few endorse full self-ownership,\neven fewer endorse it as a foundational principle.\n",
