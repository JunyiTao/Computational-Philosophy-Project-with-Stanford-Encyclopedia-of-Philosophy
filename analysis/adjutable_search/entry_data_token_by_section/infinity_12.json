    "main_text": "Mathematical ontology\n4. Mathematical ontology\n\nVarious questions about infinity naturally arise in the course of\ntheorizing about ontology. If mathematical objects exist, are there\ninfinitely many of them? Do individual infinite objects like the ones\nmentioned above exist, in addition to the infinitely many individual\nfinite numbers? This article will not directly discuss the question of\nwhether and in what sense mathematical objects exist. Instead, we will\nfocus on the question of whether the infinities discussed above exist\nin the same sense as the finite integers. For more on the general\nquestions of mathematical existence, see the entries on:\n logic and ontology,\n philosophy of mathematics,\n platonism in the philosophy of mathematics,\n nominalism in the philosophy of mathematics,\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics,\n naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics, and\n logicism and neologicism.\n\nMost viewpoints in the philosophy of mathematics accept the existence\nof all of the finite and infinite objects mentioned so far in exactly\nthe same way that they accept the existence of finite integers.\n(Platonists might accept that this is literal existence, while\nfictionalists accept this as some sort of fictional existence, and\nothers might have a different idea of what this means.) Standard set\ntheories can prove the existence of all these objects, and for most\nmathematicians and philosophers, this is all that is needed. Logicist\nand neologicist accounts of mathematics may obtain the existence of\ninfinite sets or infinitely many numbers by explicit postulation (as\nin the case of the axiom of infinity in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s\nPrincipia Mathematica) or as the outcome of an implicit\npostulation (such as Hume\u2019s Principle in Scottish neologicism,\nsee Hale and Wright 2001, Heck 1997, 2011). While the axiom of\ninfinity is easily stated and understood, Hume\u2019s Principle has a\npeculiar form, for it postulates the existence of a function \\(\\#\\)\nthat sends concepts into objects while respecting an equivalence\nrelation \\(\\approx\\) among concepts. Formally it is stated as\nfollows: \n\\[\\tag{HP} \\forall B\\forall C\\, \\# B = \\# C \\text{ iff } B \\approx C \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(B \\approx C\\) is short-hand for one of the many equivalent\nformulas of pure second order logic expressing the equivalence\nrelation \u201cthere is a one to one correlation between the objects\nfalling under \\(B\\) and those falling under \\(C\\)\u201d. Informally,\nit can be read as saying that two concepts \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) have the\nsame \u2018number\u2019 if and only if there is a one to one\ncorrespondence among the objects that fall under \\(B\\) and those that\nfall under \\(C\\). Principles like HP that define a function from an\nequivalence relation are called abstraction principles. By\npresupposing the existence of a function that sends concepts into\nobjects, Hume\u2019s Principle exploits the possibility of defining\ninfinitely many concepts that do not stand in the equivalence relation\nmentioned in its right-hand side to generate infinitely many natural\nnumbers. There are other varieties of neologicism that do not\npostulate Hume\u2019s Principle or an axiom of infinity at the outset\nbut yield infinitely many natural numbers by means of other logical\nprinciples (see for instance Linsky and Zalta 2006). In addition, all\nthese varieties of neologicism generate at least an infinite cardinal\nnumbers and what is of philosophical relevance here is the different\nresources they use to establish these results.\n\nIncidentally, Frege\u2019s logicism and the neologicist program use\none-to-one correspondence to state identity criteria for\n\u201cconcepts\u201d even when infinitely many objects fall under\nthe concepts. For alternative criteria for assigning numbers to\ninfinite concepts see Mancosu (2015) and (2016).\n\nIn light of the paradoxes for early set theories (Russell\u2019s\nparadox, the Burali-Forti paradox, and others), some mathematicians\nand philosophers worried that standard set theory might be\ninconsistent as well. One alternative viewpoint on mathematics is\nintuitionism, which only accepts the existence of\nmathematical objects whose construction can be carried out in some\nsense by the human mind. Intuitionism requires a revision of logic,\nsince this limitation invalidates the Law of Excluded\nMiddle\u2014there are cases in which we can prove that the\nnon-existence of a certain type of object would lead to a\ncontradiction, but don\u2019t have any method of constructing such an\nobject, so that there might be a truth-value gap. Intuitionists often\naccept the Aristotelian limitation to \u201cpotential\ninfinities\u201d, rather than \u201cactual infinities\u201d, but\nthere is also sophisticated intuitionistic reasoning about what types\nof infinite entities might exist. (For more, see the entries on\n intuitionistic logic\n and\n intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nAnother viewpoint, associated with David Hilbert, is called\nfinitism (see Hilbert 1926). Most finitists accept classical\nlogic, but worry about the consistency of theories of infinite\nobjects. Hilbert\u2019s worries about consistency were fueled by the\nparadoxes that the new infinitary set-theoretic mathematics was giving\nrise to (Cantor\u2019s inconsistent sets; Burali-Forti Paradox;\nRussell\u2019s paradox etc.) Hilbert was convinced that\nquantification over such infinite totalities was at the root of the\ntroubles. Finite objects, like configurations of strokes corresponding\nto the natural numbers, and finite sentences of a formal language, are\ntaken by the Hilbertian finitist to be unproblematic, since these\nobjects can in some sense be grasped individually and thus in their\n(potential) totality. But infinite objects are taken to be\nproblematic: this includes Cantor\u2019s higher ordinals and\ncardinals, and all the geometric, algebraic, and topological objects\nof which mathematicians were starting to develop detailed theories at\nthe turn of the 20th century.\n\nHilbert\u2019s proposed project (sometimes taken to be the starting\npoint for formalism in the philosophy of mathematics) was to\nreplace talk of these infinitary entities themselves with talk of the\nfinitely long sentences that we ordinarily interpret as being about\nthe entities. His goal was to axiomatize the theories of these\ninfinite objects, and then to prove, using finitary means of syntactic\nreasoning about the language, that these theories are consistent.\nWhile this idea doesn\u2019t deny the existence of the\ninfinite objects, it suggests a methodological approach of only\nliterally accepting the finitary objects, whether strokes standing for\nthe integers or sentences. (See the entry on\n Hilbert\u2019s program.)\n\nSome mathematicians and philosophers have adopted finitism not merely\nas a methodological viewpoint, but also as a metaphysical one. Finite\nobjects, like numbers and sentences, exist (in whatever sense\nmathematical objects exist), but infinite objects (like the completed\nset of all the natural numbers, or even arbitrary irrational numbers\nrepresented by Dedekind cuts) don\u2019t. Versions of this view are\noften attributed to the 19th century number theorist and algebraist,\nLeopold Kronecker, who is quoted as saying \u201cThe dear God created\nthe whole numbers; everything else is the work of man.\u201d\nKronecker criticized Cantor\u2019s work as theology rather than\nmathematics. Hilbert started his program with the intent of defending\nCantor while working within a framework dialectically acceptable to\nKronecker\u2019s allies. But when Kurt G\u00f6del proved that no\nfinitary theory for arithmetic and syntax can even prove its\nown consistency, let alone prove the consistency of a\nstronger theory for talking about completed infinities,\nHilbert\u2019s program was taken to have failed at disabusing the\nmetaphysical finitists. G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems\napply most notably to Peano Arithmetic. The language of Peano\nArithmetic is given by \\(\\{0,\\,',\\, +,\\,\\times\\}\\), where '\nis the successor function (it adds 1 to each number).\nWithin it one can express ordinary arithmetical claims such as the\ncommutativity of addition and the infinitude of prime numbers. The\naxioms of Peano Arithmetic tell us that the function '\nis one-one; that 0 is not the successor of any\nnumber; that \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) satisfy the usual recursive\ndefinitions; and finally we have a schema of induction for every\nformula \\(A(x)\\) expressible in the language, i.e. if \\(A(0)\\) and for\nall \\(x, A(x) \\rightarrow A(x')\\), then for all \\(x, A(x)\\).\n\nThe detailed foundational work carried out in set theory and other\nfoundational areas has in many ways dispelled the fear of impending\ndoom that characterized the reaction to the paradoxes at the beginning\nof the twentieth century. As a consequence, most mathematicians today\nare perfectly happy to work with completed infinities. But there are\nstill some finitists and intuitionists.\n\nAn intermediate position is that defended by classical\n\u201cpredicativists\u201d such as Poincar\u00e9 and Weyl. The\ntheory, presented in a satisfactory logical way by Feferman and\nothers, accepts the excluded middle on the natural numbers (and as\nsuch it is arguably committed to the existence of the set of natural\nnumbers and in any case to accepting bivalence on the natural numbers)\nbut does not accept the existence of the power set of the natural\nnumbers. According to predicativism (see Feferman 2005), sets\nexist only if they are definable in some non-circular linguistic way.\nIn accepting the excluded middle on the natural numbers and in making\nthe existence of sets depend on our definitional abilities, this\nposition is a sort of a compromise between a classical and a\nconstructive viewpoint. In 1918, Hermann Weyl (Weyl 1918; see Kaufmann\n1930 for a related program) presented the foundations of analysis\nwithin this framework and showed that a great part of classical\nanalysis can be carried out within the framework by replacing talk of\narbitrary sets of real numbers with arithmetical sequences of real\nnumbers. Feferman 1988 gave a detailed formal presentation of the\ntheory and proved that, on a certain reconstruction, the theory is a\nconservative extension of Peano Arithmetic. In addition, he also used\nthe theory to state an important conjecture concerning how much\nmathematics is needed in physics. In Feferman 1984 and 1987, he\nproposed that all of mathematics used in physical theory can be\nrecaptured in a predicative system of analysis. Using the\nmetatheoretical result of conservativity mentioned above, he also\nexploited the argument to claim that Quine and Putnam\u2019s\nindispensability arguments (see the entry on\n indispensability arguments in philosophy of mathematics)\n at best commit us to what Peano Arithmetic commits us to.\n\nIn contrast to the possibility of eliminating infinity as just\ndescribed stand a number of results that show that some finitary\nstatements can only be proved through infinitary considerations. These\nresults originally emerge with G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness\ntheorems (G\u00f6del 1931) but have been recently refined by\ndisplaying statements of mathematical interest (whereas\nG\u00f6del\u2019s statements are of metamathematical interest but\nhave no obvious mathematical interest). In order to understand the\nconceptual distinctions required, let us grant \u2014as most\nlogicians do\u2014that all finitistic modes of reasoning are included\nin first-order Peano Arithmetic (henceforth PA).\n\nA consequence of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems is that\nunder the assumption that PA is consistent one can find a finitistic\nstatement such that neither it nor its negation is provable from Peano\nArithmetic. G\u00f6del showed, through subtle coding of\nmetamathematical notions in the language of arithmetic, how to express\nin the language of arithmetic a formula \\(G\\) that \u201csays\u201d\nof itself that it is not provable. One can also ascertain that the\nformula is true on the natural numbers. Since all the finitary\nreasoning is assumed to be included in PA, establishing the truth of\nthe G\u00f6del sentence and of the new incompleteness results requires\nappeal to some \u201cinfinitary\u201d principles (when the truth of\nthe G\u00f6del sentence \\(G\\) is established through appeal to the\nstatement expressing the consistency of PA, it is establishing the\nlatter that requires some portion of infinitary reasoning, such as\ninduction up to an infinite ordinal called \\(\\varepsilon_0)\\).\n\nThe situation is the same for the statement Con(PA) expressing the\nconsistency of PA. G\u00f6del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem\nshows that neither it nor its negation can be proved from PA but an\nappeal to some infinitary reasoning shows it to hold in the natural\nnumbers. While perfectly fine for the logician\u2019s need and\ncentral to the evaluation of Hilbert\u2019s program,\nG\u00f6del\u2019s sentences appear concocted from the point of view\nof the practicing mathematician. Within Hilbert\u2019s program\nstatements of PA expressible either without quantifiers or with a\nstring of universal quantifiers followed by a non-quantificational\nformula count as finitistic statements. The statements \\(G\\) and\nCon(PA) mentioned above also belong to this class. Finitistic\nstatements with obvious mathematical relevance include basic\nproperties such as the commutativity of addition as well as the\nstatement of Fermat\u2019s last theorem (whose proof has been\nestablished using higher mathematics but logicians are convinced that\nit can also be carried out in PA). Logicians have not been able to\nfind finitistic statements with obvious mathematical significance that\nrequire a detour through the infinite, but they have been able to do\nthe next best thing. They have found statements that have the form\n\\((\\forall x) (\\exists y) A(x, y),\\) which express a certain\nfunctional connection between numbers and have shown that such\nstatements, although true, cannot be proved using only the resources\nof PA. Among the most famous such results are a modification of\nRamsey\u2019s finite theorem provided by Paris and Harrington (1977),\nand the proof that a theorem by Goodstein (1944) cannot be proved in\nPA (Kirby and Paris 1982). There are stronger results that are\nindependent of even stronger systems that are studied within the\ncontext of reverse mathematics (e.g., Kruskal\u2019s theorem is\nindependent of predicative analysis\u2014see Simpson 1985, 2002).\n\nSuch results show that even an arithmetical theory such as PA can\nexpress statements of mathematical significance (as opposed to\nstatements concocted for logical purposes) that require some detour\nthrough the infinite to be proved, even though they can be stated\npurely arithmetically. In contrast to arithmetic, the mathematical\nincompleteness of set theory was shown by G\u00f6del and Cohen for\nimportant statements such as the Axiom of Choice, the continuum\nhypothesis, etc. It is important to emphasize here that logicians\nworking in set theory, recursion theory and proof theory probe the\nmysterious role of the infinite in proving results about the finite.\nIt could be said that set theorists are mainly concerned with\nunderstanding how the demonstrable mathematical incompletability of\nZermelo-Fraenkel (with Choice, i.e. ZFC) set theory, which is a\nconsequence of results by G\u00f6del and Cohen, can be addressed by\nfinding new principles that will allow us to solve some of the most\npressing questions concerned with the structure of the real numbers.\nIn other words, since ZFC cannot be taken as a sufficient basis for\nthe mathematics of infinity much of contemporary set theory is trying\nto solve the problem by finding new principles, which often take the\nform of assuming the existence of very large cardinals (see the entry\non\n independence and large cardinals).\n The hope is that this work will lead to settling the Continuum\nHypothesis and other major problems about the projective sets (on\nprojective sets see entry on\n set theory).\n\nRecursion theorists are also trying to understand the role that\ninfinitary principles or compactness arguments play in our\ndetermination of results about the finite. And proof theorists would\nlike to know when certain infinitistic theories can be justified\nthrough finitary means. Obviously, a more precise description of these\ndevelopments goes well beyond the technical knowledge that we can\npresuppose here.\n\nMost working mathematicians don\u2019t worry about the existence of\ninfinitely large sets and other objects. There are some other\nontological worries about particular infinite sets, related to the\nAxiom of Choice, and some of the larger cardinalities mentioned above\nin the section on Cantor. But bigger worries arise in the context of\nwhether there can be physical infinities.\n\nFor collections of sources on the classical foundational positions\n(finitism, intuitionism, predicativism) see van Heijenoort (1967),\nEwald (1996), and Mancosu (1998).
