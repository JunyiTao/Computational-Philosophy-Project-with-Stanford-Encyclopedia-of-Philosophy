    "main_text": "Transition\n7. Transition\n\n\nShortly after Schlick arrived in Vienna, he was invited by the\nmathematician Hans Hahn to participate in a seminar on Principia\nMathematica by Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell. Upon\nits conclusion, Schlick organized (at the request of his students,\nHerbert Feigl and Friedrich Waismann) organized an extra-curricular\ndiscussion group, which came to be called the \u2018Schlick\nCircle\u2019 and (eventually) the \u2018Vienna Circle\u2019. Their\nfirst reading was\nTractatus Logico-Philosophicus, written by Russell\u2019s\nstudent, Ludwig Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein 1961; Stadler 2001, Ch.\n5). Soon, Schlick was writing Wittgenstein, seeking additional\ncopies of his work, telling him about the study group in Vienna, and\nrequesting personal meetings. After several failed attempts, Schlick\nfinally arranged with Wittgenstein\u2019s sister, Margarete\nWittgenstein Stonborough, to visit him in early 1927 (McGuinness 1967,\n14). The first clear evidence that Schlick had (at last!) obtained\na copy of the Tractatus was in a letter to Einstein in June of 1927.\n(Schlick 1927a) The following month, Schlick effusively described\nthe Tractatus as \u201cthe deepest\u201d work of the new\nphilosophy (Schlick 1927b). Over the next few years, Schlick and\nWittgenstein met as time permitted, carrying on philosophical\ndiscussions ranging over a broad array of topics, from the idea of\ngeometry as syntax, to verificationist and operationalist theories of\nmeaning, topics in logic and mathematics, and even solipsism.\n\nOf course, the\ndiscussions of verifiability in the late 1920s led to widespread\ndisputes in later positivist thought. But even in the early years,\nSchlick and his students to wondered how ethical statements might be\nverifiable. In Problems of Ethics, Schlick attempted to\ninterpret ethical statements as empirical claims about the means for\nmaximizing happiness. Relying on relative judgments of values, Schlick\nargued that an empirical foundation of an ethical system based on\nmaximum happiness. On Schlick\u2019s account, happiness is not to be\nconstrued superficially but as the elated sense of fulfillment that\naccompanies actions carried out for their own sake. Hence, there are no\napriori moral statements fixing absolute moral values.\n\n\nWittgenstein dictated some of his thoughts to Schlick, including a\nstrident verificationist series of remarks, and shared several\nmanuscripts with Schlick as well, including (perhaps) his so-called\n\u2018Big Typescript\u2019 of 1932\u20131933 (Iven 2009,\nWittgenstein 2005).  Several other documents survive the period,\nparticularly notes taken by Schlick\u2019s student, Friedrich\nWaismann, when he accompanied Schlick on his visits to Wittgenstein\n(McGuinness 1967). In addition, there were joint travels undertaken by\nWittgenstein and Schlick during the period of their interaction (Iven\n2009; Stadler 2001, Ch. 6). The principal effect of this influence on\nSchlick was the assimilation, into his already well-defined\nphilosophical views, of insights stimulated by these\nconversations. \n\n\n During the same\nperiod, Rudolf Carnap joined the faculty of the University of Vienna as\nwell as the Schlick Zirkel. He brought a manuscript with him,\nwhich he called \u201cKonstitutionstheorie\u201d, and which was\neventually published, with Schlick\u2019s help, as The Logical\nStructure of the World (Carnap 1928). Schlick even assisted\nCarnap in locating a publisher for the work. It was at this time\nthat Schlick penned the essay \u201cExperience, Cognition, and\nMetaphysics\u201d of 1926, which represents a particularly important\njuncture in his thinking. Schlick attempted to link current\ninfluences on his thought \u2013 Wittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus \nand Carnap\u2019s Aufbau \u2013 with his earlier ideas, especially the\ndistinction between intuitions and concepts (Schlick 2008, pp. 33\u201356;\nWittgenstein 1961; Carnap 1928; Schlick 2009, Sec. 7). \n\n\nWithin a few years, Schlick wrote the essays which are characteristic\nof his early Positivist thought. The first one, \u201cThe Turning\nPoint in Philosophy,\u201d appeared in 1930. It contains an early\nversion of the thesis that the function of philosophy is the analysis\nof meaning (Schlick 1979b, 154\u2013160). A more decisive article was the\n1932 essay, \u201cPositivism and Realism\u201d, a classic piece\nwhich shaped some of the most characteristic philosophical work to\nemerge from the Positivist tradition (Schlick 1979b, 259\u2013284). Schlick\ninterprets the verifiability principle strictly, by spelling out\nverification in terms of sensible experience, but at the same time\nbroadly, construed to admit any logically conceivable circumstances of\nverification (like the future verification of mountains on the far\nside of the moon). The basis of this principle, Schlick argues, is to\nbe found in scientific practice. He cites Einstein\u2019s analysis of\n\u201csimultaneity\u201d in Special Relativity as his primary\nexample, an illustration which would become a staple of Positivist\nlore. Schlick also mentioned Planck, who acknowledged that experience\nwas the source of scientific knowledge.  Schlick called the\nphilosophical view founded on this principle, \u201cLogical\nPositivism\u201d, using the designation introduced by A. E. Blumberg\nand Herbert Feigl (Blumberg and Feigl, 1931). As Schlick explained it,\nLogical Positivism is essentially a realist epistemology, like the one\ndeveloped in Schlick\u2019s General Theory of Knowledge, which shares\nlittle with the classical positivism of\n Auguste Comte,\n Ernst Mach,\nand Hans Vaihinger. Schlick\u2019s principal conclusion was that\nLogical Positivism never denies the reality of material objects but,\nrather, equates physical reality with the lawfulness of\nexperience. Unfortunately, Planck, who had always supported\nSchlick in the past, misunderstood the essay, interpreting it as a\npolemic for Machian positivism, and harshly condemning it (Planck\n1932).\n",
