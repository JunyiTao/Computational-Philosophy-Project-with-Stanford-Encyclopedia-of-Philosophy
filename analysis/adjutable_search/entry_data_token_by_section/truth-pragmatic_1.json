    "main_text": "History of the Pragmatic Theory of Truth || Peirce\u2019s Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n1.1 Peirce\u2019s Pragmatic Theory of Truth\n\nThe American philosopher, logician and scientist Charles Sanders\nPeirce (1839\u20131914) is generally recognized for first proposing a\n\u201cpragmatic\u201d theory of truth. Peirce\u2019s pragmatic\ntheory of truth is a byproduct of his pragmatic theory of meaning. In\na frequently-quoted passage in \u201cHow to Make Our Ideas\nClear\u201d (1878), Peirce writes that, in order to pin down the\nmeaning of a concept, we must:\n\n\nConsider what effects, which might conceivably have practical\nbearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our\nconception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the\nobject. (1878 [1986: 266])\n\n\nThe meaning of the concept of \u201ctruth\u201d then boils down to\nthe \u201cpractical bearings\u201d of using this term: that is, of\ndescribing a belief as true. What, then, is the practical difference\nof describing a belief as \u201ctrue\u201d as opposed to any number\nof other positive attributes such as \u201ccreative\u201d,\n\u201cclever\u201d, or \u201cwell-justified\u201d? Peirce\u2019s\nanswer to this question is that true beliefs eventually gain general\nacceptance by withstanding future inquiry. (Inquiry, for Peirce, is\nthe process that takes us from a state of doubt to a state of stable\nbelief.) This gives us the pragmatic meaning of truth and leads Peirce\nto conclude, in another frequently-quoted passage, that:\n\n\nAll the followers of science are fully persuaded that the processes of\ninvestigation, if only pushed far enough, will give one certain\nsolution to every question to which they can be applied.\u2026The\nopinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who\ninvestigate, is what we mean by the truth. (1878 [1986: 273])\n\n\nPeirce realized that his reference to \u201cfate\u201d could be\neasily misinterpreted. In a less-frequently quoted footnote to this\npassage he writes that \u201cfate\u201d is not meant in a\n\u201csuperstitious\u201d sense but rather as \u201cthat which is\nsure to come true, and can nohow be avoided\u201d (1878 [1986: 273]).\nOver time Peirce moderated his position, referring less to fate and\nunanimous agreement and more to scientific investigation and general\nconsensus (Misak 2004). The result is an account that views truth as\nwhat would be the result of scientific inquiry, if scientific inquiry\nwere allowed to go on indefinitely. In 1901 Peirce writes that:\n\n\nTruth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal\nlimit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring\nscientific belief. (1901a [1935: 5.565])\n\n\nConsequently, truth does not depend on actual unanimity or an actual\nend to inquiry:\n\n\nIf Truth consists in satisfaction, it cannot be any actual\nsatisfaction, but must be the satisfaction which would\nultimately be found if the inquiry were pushed to its ultimate and\nindefeasible issue. (1908 [1935: 6.485], emphasis in original)\n\n\nAs these references to inquiry and investigation make clear,\nPeirce\u2019s concern is with how we come to have and hold the\nopinions we do. Some beliefs may in fact be very durable but would not\nstand up to inquiry and investigation (this is true of many cognitive\nbiases, such as the Dunning-Kruger effect where people remain\nblissfully unaware of their own incompetence). For Peirce, a true\nbelief is not simply one we will hold onto obstinately. Rather, a true\nbelief is one that has and will continue to hold up to sustained\ninquiry. In the practical terms Peirce prefers, this means that to\nhave a true belief is to have a belief that is dependable in the face\nof all future challenges. Moreover, to describe a belief as true is to\npoint to this dependability, to signal the belief\u2019s scientific\nbona fides, and to endorse it as a basis for action.\n\nBy focusing on the practical dimension of having true beliefs, Peirce\nplays down the significance of more theoretical questions about the\nnature of truth. In particular, Peirce is skeptical that the\ncorrespondence theory of truth\u2014roughly, the idea that true\nbeliefs correspond to reality\u2014has much useful to say about the\nconcept of truth. The problem with the correspondence theory of truth,\nhe argues, is that it is only \u201cnominally\u201d correct and\nhence \u201cuseless\u201d (1906 [1998: 379, 380]) as far as\ndescribing truth\u2019s practical value. In particular, the\ncorrespondence theory of truth sheds no light on what makes true\nbeliefs valuable, the role of truth in the process of inquiry, or how\nbest to go about discovering and defending true beliefs. For Peirce,\nthe importance of truth rests not on a \u201ctranscendental\u201d\n(1901a [1935: 5.572]) connection between beliefs on the one hand and\nreality on the other, but rather on the practical connection between\ndoubt and belief, and the processes of inquiry that take us from the\nformer to the latter:\n\n\nIf by truth and falsity you mean something not definable in terms of\ndoubt and belief in any way, then you are talking of entities of whose\nexistence you can know nothing, and which Ockham\u2019s razor would\nclean shave off. Your problems would be greatly simplified, if,\ninstead of saying that you want to know the \u201cTruth\u201d, you\nwere simply to say that you want to attain a state of belief\nunassailable by doubt. (1905 [1998: 336])\n\n\nFor Peirce, a true belief is one that is indefeasible and\nunassailable\u2014and indefeasible and unassailable for all the right\nreasons: namely, because it will stand up to all further inquiry and\ninvestigation. In other words,\n\n\nif we were to reach a stage where we could no longer improve upon a\nbelief, there is no point in withholding the title \u201ctrue\u201d\nfrom it. (Misak 2000: 101)\n\n",
