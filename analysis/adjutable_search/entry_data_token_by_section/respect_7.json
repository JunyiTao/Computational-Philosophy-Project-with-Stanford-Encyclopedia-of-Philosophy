Respect for Nature and Nonhuman Beings\n\nAlthough persons are the paradigm objects of moral recognition\nrespect, it is a matter of some debate whether they are the only\nthings that we ought morally to respect. One serious objection raised\nagainst Kant\u2019s ethical theory is that in claiming that only\nrational beings are ends in themselves deserving of respect, it\nlicenses treating all things which aren\u2019t persons as mere means\nto the ends of rational beings, and so it supports domination and\nexploitation of all nonpersons and the natural environment. Taking\nissue with the Kantian position that only persons are respect-worthy,\nmany philosophers have argued that humans who are not agents or not\nyet agents, human embryos, nonhuman animals, sentient creatures,\nplants, species, all living things, biotic communities, the natural\necosystem of our planet, and even mountains, rocks, and viruses have\n(full or perhaps just partial) moral standing or worth and so are\nappropriate objects of or are owed moral recognition respect. Of\ncourse, it is possible to value such things instrumentally insofar as\nthey serve human interests, but the idea is that such things matter\nmorally and have a claim to respect in their own right, independently\nof their usefulness to humans.\n\nA variety of different strategies have been employed in arguing for\nsuch respect claims. For example, the concept of moral recognition\nrespect is sometimes stripped down to its essentials, omitting much of\nthe content of the concept as it appears in respect for persons\ncontexts. The respect that is owed to all things, it can be argued, is\na very basic form of attentive contemplation of the object combined\nwith a prima facie assumption that the object might have\nintrinsic value (Birch 1993). Another strategy is to argue that the\ntrue grounds for moral worth and recognition respect are other than or\nwider than rationality. One version of this strategy (employed by P.\nTaylor 1986) is to argue that all living things, persons and\nnonpersons, have equal inherent worth and so equally deserve the same\nkind of moral respect, because the ground of the worth of living\nthings that are nonpersons is continuous with the ground of the worth\nfor persons. For example, we can regard all living things as\nrespect-worthy in virtue of being quasi-agents and centers of\norganized activity that pursue their own good in their own unique way.\nI\n\nA third strategy, which is employed within Kantian ethics, is to argue\nthat respect for persons logically entails respect for nonpersons. For\nexample, one can argue that rational nature is to be respected not\nonly by respecting humanity in someone\u2019s person but also by\nrespecting things that bear certain relations to rational nature, for\nexample, by being fragments of it or necessary conditions of it.\nRespect would thus be owed to humans who are not persons and to\nanimals and other sentient beings (Foreman 2017; Rocha 2015; Wood\n1998). Another strategy argues against Kant that we can both\nacknowledge that rational moral agents have the highest moral standing\nand worth and are owed maximal respect, and also maintain that other\nbeings have lesser but still morally significant standing or worth and\nso deserve less but still some respect. So, although it is always\nwrong to use moral agents merely as means, it may be justifiable to\nuse nonpersons as means (for example, to do research on human embryos\nor kill animals for food) provided their moral worth is also\nrespectfully acknowledged (Meyer and Nelson, 2001). Much philosophical\nwork has been done, particularly in environmental ethics, to determine\nthe practical implications of the claim that things other than persons\nare owed respect (e.g., Corral 2015; Foreman 2015; Schmidtz 2011;\nBognar 2011; Connolly 2006; Wiggins 2000; Westra 1989).\n",
