    "main_text": "Frame II: Dependence on the Intellect || Benefits of Reframing the Debate in Terms of Intellectual Dependence\n4.2 Benefits of Reframing the Debate in Terms of Intellectual Dependence\n\nProponents of the second frame have argued that there are a variety of\nbenefits of recasting the concept-intuition debate in this way. First,\nit avoids requiring any attribution to Kant of the controversial\nassumption that intuition essentially has a correctness condition that\ncould be the object of epistemic attitudes. Of course, a proponent of\nIntellectualism might argue to the conclusion that intuitions\nessentially have correctness conditions as a result of their\ngeneration by acts of synthesis. But such a position would be an\noutcome of the Intellectualist\u2019s argument, rather than as an\nassumption thereof.\n\nSecond, the framework allows for a wide plurality of nevertheless\nrelated ways in which intuition, perception, and experience might\ndepend on (or be independent from) the intellect. For example,\nintuition might depend on a pre-conceptual pure apperceptive\npower to unify one\u2019s representations (e.g., Waxman 2014), while\nperception depends on the recognition of what is so unified in a\nconcept, though not yet in an explicit judgment (e.g., Gomes 2017a),\nand experience on the predication of that concept in an act of\njudgment (e.g., Strawson 1970). Now, instead of thinking of this\nseries as three distinct positions, two of which are\n\u201cconceptualist\u201d, and one of which is\n\u201cjudgmentalist\u201d, we can construe them as each developments\nof a single Intellectualist position. The Intellectualism/Sensibilism\nframe thus provides a way of unifying a variety of different\napproaches around a single central \u201cbright line\u201d\ndistinction (McLear 2015, 2016a; Gomes 2017a; Indregard\nforthcoming).\n\nEven with respect to the single issue of the generation of intuition,\nwe can see a plurality of ways in which an Intellectualist view might\nbe developed, in increasing order of demandingness. First, we have\nthose that construe the dependence of intuition on the power of\napperception itself, prior to how that power is manifested in\ndiscursive acts of conceptualization, judgment, and inference (e.g.,\nWaxman 1991, 2014; Longuenesse 1998; Messina 2014; Friedman 2015).\nSecond, we have positions according to which intuition depends on the\napplication of a concept, but not in judgment (e.g., Gr\u00fcne 2009;\nLand 2015a; McDowell 1998). Third, we have positions according to\nwhich intuition depends on overt acts of judgment (e.g., Strawson\n1970; Pippin 1982: 28). While there are obvious and important\ndifferences between these views, they are all united by a commitment\nto construing intuition as the outcome of a process that depends upon\nthe intellectual capacity to unify one\u2019s mental states as one\nand all states of single self-conscious individual.\n\nSimilarly, positions that might be grouped together as\n\u201cnonconceptualist\u201d according to the first frame are, on\nthis frame, organized quite differently. For example, a variety of\ninterpreters reject the position that pure intuition depends on a\nconceptual synthesis (e.g., Longuenesse 1998: ch. 8; Waxman 2014;\nAllais 2015: ch. 7; McLear 2015; Friedman 2015; Golob 2016a).\nAccording to the Conceptualism frame, one might thus think of these\npositions as all in agreement concerning a basic (and controversial)\nelement of Kant\u2019s view, and thus all as forms of\n\u2018Nonconceptualism\u2019. However, these positions in fact\nradically disagree concerning whether intuition is dependent\non the intellect. Their disagreement hinges on the issue of the\ndependence of intuition on intellectual acts per se rather\nthan on conceptual content or conceptual synthesis (for further\ndiscussion see\n \u00a75\n below). So, according to the second frame, interpreters who consider\nintuition to depend on nonconceptual but still\nintellectual acts (e.g., Longuenesse 1998; Waxman 2014;\nIndregard forthcoming) will be put on the Intellectualist side while\nthose who reject such dependence (e.g., Allais 2015; McLear 2015) will\nbe put on the Nonintellectualist or Sensibilist side. Within\nSensibilism there may be significant differences between how different\ninterpreters construe the manner in which intuition gives an object\nfor cognition, or in the manner in which perception and experience are\ngenerated from mental acts performed on intuition (compare, e.g.,\nAllais 2017a and Tolley 2019), but all will agree on the fundamental\npoint that intuition may be generated independently of any\nintellectual act.\n\nIntellectualism thus captures much of what seems to have originally\nmotivated Conceptualism, but without appealing to problematic\nconceptions of \u2018content\u2019, and allowing that there may be a\nway that the intellect plays a role in sense experience apart from\novert conceptual judgment concerning that experience. Recall that two\nmotivations underlying the dispute between Conceptualism and\nNonconceptualism concerned, first the justificatory or broader\nrational role of sense experience with respect to belief or judgment\nand, second, the most plausible way of interpreting Kant\u2019s\nargument in the Transcendental Deduction. These motivations remain\npresent in the dispute between Sensibilism and Intellectualism. Hence,\nthe substantive motivations of Conceptualism remain even if the\nframing regarding representational content is dropped in favor of\nfocus on dependence on the intellect.\n\nThus, the division between Intellectualism and Sensibilism concerning\nthe dependence of intuition on the pure apperceptive power and/or\nthose intellectual capacities downstream from it captures a central\npoint (and perhaps the central point) of contention between\nan otherwise large plurality of views, and in this way helps to\norganize a dispute that might otherwise seem to lack unity. In the\nnext section we look at what have emerged as the most promising,\ncentral, or stubborn points of dispute between these two camps.\n",
