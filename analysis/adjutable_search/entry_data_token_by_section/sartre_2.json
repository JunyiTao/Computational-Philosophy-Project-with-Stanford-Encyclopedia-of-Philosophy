Imagination, Phenomenology and Literature\n\nFor many of his readers, the book on the Imaginary that\nSartre published in 1940 constitutes one of the most rigorous and\nfruitful developments of his Husserl-inspired phenomenological\ninvestigations. Along with the The Emotions: Outline of a\nTheory which was published one year before (Sartre 1939b), Sartre\npresented this study of imagination as an essay in phenomenological\npsychology, which drew on his lifetime interest in psychological\nstudies and brought to completion the research on imagination he had\nundertaken since the very beginning of his philosophical career. With\nthis new essay, Sartre continues to explore the relationship between\nintentional consciousness and reality by focusing upon the specific\ncase of the intentional relations to the unreal and the fictional, so\nas to produce an in-depth analysis of \u201cthe great\n\u2018irrealizing\u2019 function of consciousness\u201d. Engaging\nin a detailed discussion with recent psychological research that\nSartre juxtaposes with (and against) fine-grained phenomenological\ndescriptions of the structures of imagination, his essay proposes his\nown theory of the imaginary as the corollary of a specific intentional\nattitude that orients consciousness towards the unreal.\n\nIn a similar fashion to his analysis of the world-shaping powers of\nemotions (Sartre 1939b), Sartre describes and highlights how\nimagination presents us with a coherent world, although made of\nobjects that do not precede but result from the imaging\ncapacities of consciousness. \u201cThe object as imaged, Sartre\nclaims, is never anything more than the consciousness one has of\nit\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 15]). Contrary to other modes of\nconsciousness such as perception or memory, which connect us to a\nworld that is essentially one and the same, the objects to which\nimaginative consciousness connects us belong to imaginary worlds,\nwhich may not only be extremely diverse, but also follow their own\nrules, having their own spatiality and temporality. The island of\nThrinacia where Odysseus lands on his way back to Ithaca needs not be\nlocated anywhere on our maps nor have existed at a specific time: its\nmode of existence is that of a fictional object, which possesses its\nown spatiality and temporality within the imaginary world it belongs\nto.\n\nSartre stresses that the intentional dimension of imaging\nconsciousness is essentially characterised by its negativity.\nThe negative act, Sartre writes, is \u201cconstitutive of the\nimage\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 183]): an image consciousness is a\nconsciousness of something that is not, whether its object is\nabsent, non-existing, or fictional. When we picture Odysseus sailing\nback to his native island, Odysseus is given to us \u201cas absent to\nintuition\u201d. In this sense, Sartre concludes, \n\n\none can say that the image has wrapped within it a certain\nnothingness. [\u2026] However lively, appealing, strong the image,\nit gives its object as not being. (Sartre 1940 [2004: 14]) \n\n\nThe irrealizing function of imagination results from this immediate\nconsciousness of the nothingness of its object. Sartre\u2019s essay\ninvestigates how imaging consciousness allows us to operate with its\nobjects as if they were present, even though these very objects are\ngiven to us as non-existing or absent. This is for instance what\nhappens when we go to the theatre or read a novel: \n\n\nTo be present at a play is to apprehend the characters on the actors,\nthe forest of As You Like It on the cardboard trees. To read\nis to realize contact with the irreal world on the signs. In this\nworld there are plants, animals, fields, towns, people: initially\nthose mentioned in the book and then a host of others that are not\nnamed but are in the background and give this world its depth. (Sartre\n1940 [2004: 64]) \n\n\nThe irreality of imaginary worlds does not prevent the spectator or\nreader from projecting herself into this world as if it was\nreal. The acts of imagination can consequently be described as\n\u201cmagical acts\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 125]), similar to\nincantations with respect to the way they operate, since they are\ndesigned to make the object of one\u2019s thought or desire appear in\nsuch a way that one can take possession of it.\n\nIn the conclusion of his essay, Sartre stresses the philosophical\nsignificance of the relationship between imagination and freedom,\nwhich are both necessarily involved in our relationship to the world.\nImagination, Sartre writes, \u201cis the whole of consciousness as it\nrealizes its freedom\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 186]). Imaging\nconsciousness posits its object as \u201cout of reach\u201d in\nrelation to the world understood as the synthetic totality within\nwhich consciousness situates itself. For Sartre, the imaginary\ncreation is only possible if consciousness is not placed\n\u201cin-the-midst-of-the-world\u201d as one existent among others.\n\n\n\nFor consciousness to be able to imagine, it must be able to escape\nfrom the world by its very nature, it must be able to stand back from\nthe world by its own efforts. In a word, it must be free. (Sartre 1940\n[2004: 184]) \n\n\nIn that respect, the irrealizing function of imagination allows\nconsciousness to \u201csurpass the real\u201d so as to constitute it\nas a proper world: \u201cthe nihilation of the real is\nalways implied by its constitution as a world\u201d. This capacity of\nsurpassing the real to make it a proper world defines the very notion\nof \u201csituation\u201d that becomes central in Sartre\u2019s\nphilosophical thought after the publication of the Imaginary.\nSituations are nothing but \u201cthe different immediate modes of\napprehension of the real as a world\u201d (Sartre 1940 [2004: 185]).\nConsciousness\u2019 situation-in-the-world is precisely that which\nmotivates the constitution of any irreal object and accounts for the\ncreation of imaginary worlds\u2014for instance, and perhaps above\nall, in art: \n\n\nEvery apprehension of the real as a world tends of its own accord to\nend up with the production of irreal objects since it is always, in a\nsense, free nihilation of the world and this always from a particular\npoint of view. (Sartre 1940 [2004: 185]) \n\n\nWith this conclusion, which prioritises the question of the world over\nthat of reality, Sartre begins to move away from the realist\nperspective he was initially aiming at when he first discovered\nphenomenology, so as to make the phenomenological investigation of our\n\u201cbeing-in-the-world\u201d (influenced by his careful rereading\nof Heidegger in the late 30s) his new priority. \n\nAlthough Sartre never stated it explicitly, his interest in the\nquestion of the unreal and imaging consciousness appears to be\nintimately connected with his general conception of literature and his\nself-understanding of his own literary production. The concluding\nremarks of the Imaginary extend the scope of Sartre\u2019s\nphenomenological analyses of the irrealizing powers of imagination, by\napplying them to the domain of aesthetics so as to answer the question\nabout the ontological status of works of art. For Sartre, any product\nof artistic creation\u2014a novel, a painting, a piece of music, or a\ntheatre play\u2014is just as irreal an object as the imaginary world\nit gives rise to. The irreality of the work of art allows us to\nexperience\u2014though only imaginatively\u2014the world it gives\nflesh to as an \u201canalogon\u201d of reality. Even a cubist\npainting, which might not depict nor represent anything, still\nfunctions as an analogon, which manifests \n\n\nan irreal ensemble of new things, of objects that I have\nnever seen nor will ever see but that are nonetheless irreal objects.\n(Sartre 1940 [2004: 191]) \n\n\nLikewise, the novelist, the poet, the dramatist, constitute irreal\nobjects through verbal analogons.\n\nThis original conception of the nature of the work of art dominates\nSartre\u2019s critical approach to literature in the many essays he\ndedicates to the art of the novel. This includes his critical analyses\nof recent writers\u2019 novels in the 30s\u2014Faulkner, Dos Passos,\nHemingway, Mauriac, etc.\u2014and the publication in the late 40s of\nhis own summative view, What is literature? (Sartre 1948a\n[1988]). In a series of articles gathered in the first volume of his\nSituations (1947, Sit. I), Sartre defends a strong\nversion of literary realism that can, somewhat paradoxically, be read\nas a consequence of his theory of the irreality of the work of art. If\nimagination projects the spectator within the imaginary world created\nby the artist, then the success of the artistic process is\nproportional to the capacity of the artwork to let the spectator\nexperience it as a reality of its own, giving rise to a full-fledged\nworld. Sartre applies in particular this analysis to novels, which\nmust aim, according to him, at immersing the reader within the\nfictional world they depict so as to make her experience the events\nand adventures of the characters as if she was living them in\nfirst person. The complete absorption of the reader within the\nimaginary world created by the novelist must ultimately recreate the\nparticular feel of reality that defines Sartre\u2019s\nphenomenological kind of literary realism (Renaudie 2017),\nwhich became highly influential over the following decades in French\nliterature. The reader must be able to experience the actions of the\ncharacters of the novel as if they did not result from the imagination\nof the novelist, but proceeded from the character\u2019s own\nfreedom\u2014and Sartre goes as far as to claim that this radical\n\u201cspellbinding\u201d (\u201cenvo\u00fbtante\u201d, Sartre\n1940 [2004: 175])) quality of literary fiction defines the touchstone\nof the art of the novel (See \u201cFran\u00e7ois Mauriac and\nFreedom\u201d, in Sartre Sit. I).\n\nThis original version of literary realism is intrinsically tied to the\nquestion of freedom, and opposed to the idea according to which\nrealist literature is expected to provide a mere description of\nreality as it is. In What is Literature?, Sartre\ndescribes the task of the novelist as that of disclosing the world as\nif it arose from human freedom\u2014rather than from a deterministic\nchain of causes and consequences. The author\u2019s art consists in\nobliging her reader \u201cto create what [she]\ndiscloses\u201d, and so to share with the writer the\nresponsibility and freedom involved in the act of literary creation\n(Sartre 1948a [1988: 61]). In order for the world of the novel to\noffer its maximum density, \n\n\nthe disclosure-creation by which the reader discovers it must also be\nan imaginary engagement in the action; in other words, the more\ndisposed one is to change it, the more alive it will be. \n\n\nThe conception of the writer\u2019s engagement that resulted from\nthese analyses constitutes probably the most well-known aspect of\nSartre\u2019s relation to literature. The writer only has one topic:\nfreedom.\n\nThis analysis of the role of imaginative creations of art can also\nhelp us to understand the role of philosophy within his own novels,\nparticularly in Nausea, a novel which Sartre began as he was\nstudying Husserl in Berlin. In this novel Sartre\u2019s\npre-phenomenological interest for the irreducibility of contingency\nintersects with his newly-acquired competences in phenomenological\nanalyses, making Nausea a beautifully illustrated expression\nof the metaphysical register Sartre gave to Husserl\u2019s conception\nof intentionality. The feeling of nausea that Roquentin, the main\ncharacter of Sartre\u2019s novel, famously experienced in a public\ngarden while obsessively watching a chestnut tree, accounts for his\nsensitivity to the absolute lack of necessity of whatever exists.\nSartre understands this radical absence of necessity as the expression\nof the fundamental contingency of being. Roquentin\u2019s traumatic\nmoment of realisation that there is absolutely no reason for the\nexistence of all that exists illustrates the intuition that motivated\nSartre\u2019s philosophical thinking since the very beginning of his\nintellectual career as a student at the Ecole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure, as Simone de Beauvoir recalls (1981 [1986]). It\nconstitutes the metaphysical background of his interpretation of\nintentionality, which he would come to develop and systematise in the\nearly dense parts of Being and Nothingness. While the\nexperience of nausea when confronting the contingency of the chestnut\ntree does not give us conceptual knowledge, it involves a form of\nnon-conceptual ontological awareness that is of a fundamentally\ndifferent order to, and cannot be derived from, our conceptual\nunderstanding and knowledge of brute existence.\n",
