    "main_text": "Life and Works || Life\n1.1 Life\n\nAnthony Collins was born in Heston, Middlesex on June 21, 1676 into a\nfamily of lawyers. He went to Eton and then King\u2019s College,\nCambridge in 1693. Though he had not graduated from Cambridge, Collins\nwent to the Middle Temple in 1694 to study law. He didn\u2019t like\nthe law and was never called to the Bar. In 1698 he married the\ndaughter of a rich London merchant, Sir Francis Child. She died in\nchildbirth in 1703. At the time of his marriage he received some\nproperty in Essex from his father. Together with his wife\u2019s\ndowry, this made him a very rich man indeed. Collins met John Locke on\na visit to Oates in Essex in 1703, visited Locke five times over the\nnext 18 months and carried on a correspondence with him about various\nphilosophical topics. In one of his letters to Collins Locke remarked:\n\n\n\nBelieve it, my good friend, to love truth for truth\u2019s sake is\nthe principal part of human perfection in this world, and the seed bed\nof all other virtues; and if I mistake not, you have as much of it as\nI have ever met with in anybody. \n\n\nCollins was a lifelong bibliophile with a large private research\nlibrary. In the article on Collins in Birch\u2019s Dictionary, Birch\nnotes that his \n\n\nlarge and curious [library] was open to all men of letters, to whom he\nreadily communicated all the lights and assistance in his power, and\neven furnished his antagonists with books to confute himself, and\ndirected them how to give their arguments all the force of which they\nwere capable. (Birch, quoted in Berman 1975: 50) \n\n\nDuring this period Collins also met Samuel Bold and John Toland. From\n1703 until 1706, after his wife\u2019s death, Collins spent the\nwinters in London and the summers at his fine summer mansion in\nBuckinghamshire\u2014where Queen Anne and her court visited him. In\n1707 Collins began a pamphlet controversy with Samuel Clarke, a\nprominent British philosopher and member of Newton\u2019s inner\ncircle, over the question of whether matter can think. The controversy\ncontinued until 1708. In 1707 Collins also published anonymously the\nEssay Concerning the Use of Reason in Propositions, the evidence\nwhereof depends on human testimony. During this period Collins\nfrequented the London coffee shops where the deists and free-thinkers\nmet. Berkeley apparently met him at such a gathering in 1713. In 1710\nCollins made his first trip to the Continent, spending his time buying\nbooks in Holland and meeting John Churchill, first Duke of\nMarlborough, and Prince Eugene. Back in England, Collins met several\ntimes with Samuel Clarke and William Whiston at the house of Lady\nCalverly and Sir John Hubern for \u201cfrequent but friendly debates\nabout the truth of the Bible and the Christian Religion\u201d\n(Whiston, quoted in O\u2019Higgins 1970: 77). In 1713 he published\nA Discourse Concerning Free-Thinking. The Discourse\nwas his most controversial work. He made a second trip to the\ncontinent about the time that the Discourse was published.\nAgain he went to Holland and France and planned to go on to Italy. The\ntrip was cut short by the death of a close kinsman. In 1715 Collins,\nin effect, took root in Essex, moving into Mowdon Hall. Collins\nprobably owned a good 2000 acres in Essex, much of it prime\nagricultural land. In 1717 he published A Philosophical Enquiry\nConcerning Human Liberty in which he argues for a compatibilist\nform of determinism and rejects freedom of the will. Samuel Clarke\nreviewed the book, continuing the argument that had begun during the\nClarke Collins correspondence of 1707\u201308.\n\nFrom 1717 on Collins spent most of his time in the country, but still\nhad a keen interest in national politics at a distance, and local\npolitics in person. Collins was a Whig and became a spokesman for the\nWhigs in the country. Collins took a serious role in the government of\nEssex\u2014serving as a justice, a commissioner for taxes, and then\nTreasurer of the County. He examined roads and bridges. He was\ninvolved in finding a place for housing county records. As Treasurer\nhe was a model of integrity. In considering the relation between\nCollins, the County official and Collins the writer, O\u2019Higgins\nnotes that Collins was probably less tolerant towards Catholics than\nother justices (O\u2019Higgins 1970: 128\u20139). Collins the writer\nis consistently anti-Catholic. So, while one might hope that the use\nof reason would produce a higher degree of toleration towards all\nreligious groups than one would expect to find among true believers,\nthere seems to be little conflict here between the writer and the\njurist.\n\nIn December 1723 Collins\u2019 only son suddenly became ill and died.\nHis father was grief-stricken. Collins remarried in 1724 and he\npublished what is perhaps his most successful book, A Discourse on\nthe Grounds and Reasons of the Christian Religion as well as\nAn Historical and Critical Essay on the Thirty Nine Articles of\nthe Church of England. From 1725 until 1729 Collins\u2019 health\nbegan to deteriorate. Still, in 1726 he published The Scheme of\nLiteral Prophecy Considered. In 1729 Collins published A\nDiscourse Concerning Ridicule and Irony in Writing. He was\nsuffering from gall stones and finally died of his disease on December\n13, 1729. His second wife Elisabeth and his two daughters survived\nhim. He willed his unpublished manuscripts to Pierre Desmaizeaux but\nDesmaizeaux took an offer from Collins\u2019 widow to buy them.\nDesmaizeaux quickly regretted his decision, but it was too late. He\naccused Elisabeth Collins of giving some of Collins unpublished papers\nto the Bishop of Lincoln. She denied that the story was true. She\nwilled some or all of Collins unpublished papers to a friend. What\nbecame of them is still a mystery.\n",
