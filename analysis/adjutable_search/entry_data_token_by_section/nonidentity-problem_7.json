    "main_text": "Proposed solutions to the nonidentity problem || Seemingly wrong act is not wrong; \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d\n3.1 Seemingly wrong act is not wrong; \u201cbiting the bullet\u201d\n\nSome philosophers have understood the exculpatory implication of the\nnonidentity analysis \u2013 and specifically the application of\nintuitions (1) and (2) \u2013 to form the basis of a perfectly good\nargument in favor of an interesting conclusion we should just accept:\nthat intuition (3) is false and that the acts under scrutiny are not\nafter all morally wrong.\n\nAs before, an assumption of the argument is that the existences under\nconsideration are worth having. We should understand, however, that at\nleast in theory a particular existence can be less than worth\nhaving: a child will be brought into existence who is made so\nmiserable (as a result, e.g., of a genetic impairment) that we want to\nsay that it is wrong, and makes things worse, to bring that child into\nexistence to begin with. In such cases, some philosophers hold fast to\nintuition (3) and others don\u2019t. David Heyd thus maintains that\nthe acts under scrutiny are not wrong. According to Heyd, comparisons\nbetween the wellbeing level a given person has at a world at which\nthat person exists and the wellbeing level that same person has at a\nworld where that person never exists are not cogent and hence we are\nforced (given intuitions (1) and (2)) to conclude that no wrong has\nbeen done (Heyd, 2009; Heyd 1992, 30\u201333). Philosophers who\nthink, however, that such comparisons can cogently be made \u2013 who\naccept, we can say, Existence Comparability \u2013 remain\nfree to limit their \u201cbite the bullet\u201d conclusion to the\ncase where the existence is worth having. Thus, David Boonin is, for\nexample, at least neutral on Existence Comparability. That is, he\ndoesn\u2019t reject the view that we can isolate and set aside those\ncases in which \u201clife [is] worse than no life at all\u201d\n(Boonin 2008, 130 and 135; Boonin 2014; see also Bayne 2010).\nMoreover, Boonin implicitly limits his own \u201cbite the\nbullet\u201d strategy to cases in which the life is worth\nliving. Only in those cases does he press the point that the acts\nunder scrutiny are not morally wrong. \n\nIn those cases, moreover, Boonin thinks we can reach a stronger\nconclusion than Heyd does. Thus Heyd is willing to say that the acts\nunder scrutiny are not morally wrong but not to say that\nthose same acts are morally permissible. Heyd\u2019s view is\nthat we aren\u2019t in a position to evaluate them at all \u2013\nthat they fall into the category of the genethical rather\nthan the straightforwardly ethical. Boonin, in contrast, thinks we can\nevaluate them. And, given, again, that we are in a case in which the\nexistence is worth having, he thinks we can evaluate them as morally\npermissible (Boonin 2008, 146\u2013149; Boonin 2014).\n\nOne other note on Heyd\u2019s approach is in order. At least some of\nHeyd\u2019s language suggests that he accepts a certain principle\nthat, to be sure, implies intuition (2) but also goes well beyond that\nintuition. According to that principle, the \u201cno harm done\u201d\nresult is in order, not just in the case where the flawed existence is\nunavoidable if the person is ever to exist at all and where,\nin that strong sense, the person\u2019s coming into existence\n\u201cdepends on\u201d the act under scrutiny being performed, but\nalso in the case where agents simply retain \u201ccontrol\u201d over\nwhether that person comes into existence or not (Heyd 1992, 105 and,\ngenerally, 99\u2013106; Heyd 2009, 15\u201317). According to that\nprinciple, even if the couple has the alternative of bringing the same\nchild into a better existence \u2013 even if the existence is not\nunavoidably flawed \u2013 if the couple also has the\nalternative of not bringing the child into existence at all,\nthe act under scrutiny cannot harm, or make things worse for, the\nchild. The idea here would be that, until we actually produce them,\n\u201cwe might decide not to make them the subject of any kind of\nmoral status whatsoever\u201d \u2013 a situation that leaves them,\neven if they are in fact on their way into existence, with\n\u201cno moral status of any kind, not even a weak one,\u201d\nrelative to the act under scrutiny (Heyd 1992, 99). \n\nNot surprisingly, and even in the case of Boonin\u2019s less extreme version, the \u201cbite the bullet\u201d strategy has\nencountered substantial resistance. See, e.g., Parfit 2017, pp.\n126\u2013129. If forced to choose between the person-based intuition\nand the concrete moral judgment that what the agents have done in the\ndepletion case or slave child case is wrong, we may well opt for the\nconcrete moral judgment. Among other things, it seems implausible that\nour future-directed conduct should get a free moral pass whenever it\naffects the timing and manner of conception. So much affects the\ntiming and manner of conception! Even given the assumption that the\nexistences we are dealing with are worth having, it seems implausible\nthat such acts are always morally permissible.\n\nOf course, as Heyd notes, in many cases an act that creates a low\nwellbeing level for a person whose existence depends on that\nact will also create low wellbeing levels for people whose existences\nare independent of that act. If an agent buries glass in the\nwood prior to conceiving a child, then even if that act affects the\ntiming and manner of conception and thus (according to the logic of\nthe nonidentity analysis) would not make things worse for the\nagent\u2019s own child, that act might still make things worse for a\nneighbor\u2019s child. On that ground, the act can be\ndeclared wrong (Heyd 1992, 193\u2013203). The choice of wrongful\nlife, as well, can have deleterious effects on people other than the\nimpaired child \u2013 burdens, in other words, that the impaired\nchild itself will then be required to share (Roberts 2009a).\n\nIn fact, Parfit himself points out that the 14-year-old girl\u2019s\nchoice to have a child has \u201ceffects on other people\u201d\nbesides the girl\u2019s child (Parfit, 1987, 361). However, as Parfit\nalso points out, the problem arises in a \u201cpurer form,\u201d\ne.g., the depletion example (Parfit, 1987, 361). As Heyd himself is\nfully aware, the \u201charm to others\u201d response isn\u2019t\navailable in all of the nonidentity cases.\n\nBoonin offers another suggestion for making the \u201cbite the\nbullet\u201d strategy plausible. According to Boonin, our intuition\nthat the acts under scrutiny \u2013 in, e.g., the depletion case and\nthe slave child case \u2013 are wrong is itself rooted in the fact\nthat we have a hard time keeping \u201cpresent before our\nmind\u2019s eye\u201d what makes the nonidentity cases\n\u201catypical\u201d and \u201cidiosyncratic\u201d \u2013 namely,\nthat in the nonidentity cases low wellbeing levels do not correlate in\nthe usual way or the way we have come to expect to a person\u2019s\nhaving been made worse off (Boonin 2008, 146\u2013149; Boonin 2014).\nWe then confuse the atypical case with the ordinary case in which low\nwellbeing levels do signify a person\u2019s having been made\nworse off. We then, mistakenly, see wrongdoing not just in the\nordinary case but in the atypical case as well. Once we appreciate\nthat confusion, we should find ourselves more comfortable abandoning\nthe view that a wrong has been done in the atypical case.\n\nBoonin\u2019s theory is, however, hard to test, especially since we\n\u2013 post-Parfit \u2013 at least feel that we always have\nthe relevant distinction clearly in mind but continue to consider the\ndepletion choice wrong. \n",
