    "main_text": "Arguments For Constructive Empiricism || The Pragmatics of Explanation\n2.5 The Pragmatics of Explanation\n\nScientific realists, by contrast, sometimes say that they believe in\nthe truth of scientific theories because the theories provide a\nsatisfying explanation of the observable phenomena, an explanation\nthat unifies what would otherwise be disparate observations. The\nconstructive empiricist is not moved by such considerations:\n\nA person may believe that a certain theory is true and explain that he\ndoes so, for instance, because it is the best explanation he has of\nthe facts or because it gives him the most satisfying world picture.\nThis does not make him irrational, but I take it to be part of\nempiricism to disdain such reasons. (van Fraassen 1985, 252)\n\n\nIndeed, one can recognize the explanatory power of a theory without\ntaking it to be true. Van Fraassen points out that theories can\nexplain well even if they are false. Newton\u2019s theory of\ngravitation explains the motion of the planets and the tides,\n\u201cHuygens\u2019s theory explained the diffraction of light,\nRutherford\u2019s theory of the atom explained the scattering of\nalpha particles, Bohr\u2019s theory explained the hydrogen spectrum,\nLorentz\u2019s theory explained clock retardation.\u201d But none of\nthese theories is now thought to be true.\n\nFor the constructive empiricist, the explanatory power of a theory\namounts to nothing more than the theory\u2019s ability to provide\ncertain bits of information in response to contextually defined\nqueries. Scientific explanation amounts to the highlighting of various\naspects of the structure postulated by the theory, to answer, in a\ncontextually dependent way, various questions of interest to us (van\nFraassen 1980, 124). Science, then, contributes nothing to explanation\nover and above the descriptive and informative content of the\nscientific theory: \u201ca success of explanation is a success of\nadequate and informative description\u201d (van Fraassen 1980,\n156\u2013157). Explanation cannot be reduced to that content, though,\nsince explanation cannot occur unless an appropriate question, offered\nin a particular context, is provided. Explanation thus goes beyond\nwhat science reveals to us. The constructive empiricist can hence\navoid saddling scientists with a commitment to the unobservable\nentities invoked in such explanations, properly claiming that such\ncommitments are not licensed by the activity of science. (See Kitcher\n& Salmon 1987 for the view that even if requests for explanation\nare contextually delimited, what counts as a good / relevant\nexplanation depends also on non-contextual factors.)\n\nA fair portion of the constructive empiricist\u2019s account of\nscientific explanation is thus devoted to an explication of the\ncontextual dependence of explanation. Among other reasons given in\nfavor of that contextual dependence, van Fraassen points out that\nexplanations are typically causal in character\u2014they attempt to\nsituate the event-to-be-explained in the \u201ccausal net\u201d\npostulated by the scientific theory. Which events in that net are\npicked out as \u201cthe\u201d cause(s) of some event-to-be-explained\ndepend upon the interests of the individuals asking the explanatory\nquestion (1980, 124\u2013126).\n\nExplanation will frequently involve the invocation of counterfactuals,\noften of the form: if event B had not occurred, neither would event A\nhave (van Fraassen 1980, 118). That\u2019s because (as just noted)\nexplanations are frequently causal in character, and analyses of\ncausation typically invoke some sort of counterfactual. Another\ncomponent of the constructive empiricist\u2019s efforts at showing\nexplanation to be context-dependent, then, amounts to his exposition\nof the context dependence of counterfactuals.\n\nVan Fraassen points out that any counterfactual has a ceteris paribus\nclause, but what is \u201cbeing kept equal\u201d by the asserter of\nthe counterfactual varies from context to context. For example,\nconsider the counterfactual, \u201cIf Tom were to light the fuse,\nthere would be an explosion.\u201d If the ceteris paribus clause of\nthe speaker keeps constant the fact that the fuse leads to a barrel of\ngunpowder, and the fact that lit fuses leading to barrels of gunpowder\ntypically result in explosions, then the counterfactual would, in that\ncontext, be true. If, on the other hand, the ceteris paribus clause of\nthe speaker also kept constant the fact that Tom is generally paranoid\nabout explosions around barrels of gunpowder and fuses, and would only\nlight the fuse if he had disconnected the fuse from the barrel, then\nthe counterfactual would, in that context, be false (1980, 116). Until\nthe context that fixes the ceteris paribus clause is specified, we\ncannot say what the truth value of the counterfactual in question is.\nOnly once the context is determined does the counterfactual admit of\nan objective truth value.\n\nOne of the reasons the constructive empiricist highlights the context\ndependence of explanation is that she wishes to show how efforts at\nexplaining various parts of the world extend beyond the activity of\nscience. Since, for instance, the propositions of science are not\ncontext-dependent in character, but the counterfactuals involved in\nexplanation are, we have reason to think that explanation involves\nsomething more than the descriptive information science gives us:\nnamely, the context-dependent interests of the individual seeking an\nexplanation in answer to some question. Also, if (as seems likely) the\nconcept of a law of nature has to be understood in a counterfactual\nway, counterfactuals\u2019 context-dependence implies that those\nlaws, too, go beyond what science reveals to us (van Fraassen 1980,\n118).\n\nIt should be clear here, then, that the constructive\nempiricist\u2019s efforts at showing explanatory efforts to extend\nbeyond the activity of science are part of an effort to show that the\nscientific realist is mistaken in thinking that science gives us\nreason to think that claims about causation, laws of nature, and other\ncounterfactuals represent objective, context-independent truths about\nthe world.\n\nScientific realists might point out that constructive empiricists do\nallow that explanatory power can count as a pragmatic virtue of a\ntheory (van Fraassen 1980, 89). But, one might naturally think, no\nscientist can acknowledge the explanatory power of a theory without\ntaking the theory to be true. So, continues the scientific realist,\nthe constructive empiricist cannot admit the usefulness of explanatory\npower to the scientist without also regarding the scientist as taking\nher theories to be true.\n\nThe constructive empiricist disagrees. Among other reasons, she can\ncite the earlier mentioned explanatory power of false theories.\nAdditionally, the constructive empiricist might insist that use of a\ntheory need not entail a commitment to the theory\u2019s entire\nontology. A person offering an explanation speaks from within the\nlanguage of the theory she accepts. Consistent with that acceptance,\nshe is \u201cconceptually immersed\u201d within the theory. But such\nuse of language need not reflect the individual\u2019s epistemic\ncommitment, which may be merely to take the theory to be empirically\nadequate (van Fraassen 1980, 151\u2013152). So, for instance, talk of\npossibility and necessity can be thought of not as talk about some\nobjective modality in nature, but as talk of what phenomena fit in the\nmodels of the accepted theory (van Fraassen 1980, 201\u2013202).\n\u2018X is possible\u2019 can be interpreted as\n\u2018X appears in some model of the theory,\u2019 while\n\u2018X is necessary\u2019 can be read as \u2018X\nappears in every model of the theory.\u2019 Again, the constructive\nempiricist sees the scientist as \u201cimmersing\u201d herself in\nthe world of the theory, talking as if the theory were true, with\nlanguage reflecting the structure of the theory. But she need not take\nthe theory\u2019s modal structure to correspond to any in\nreality.\n",
