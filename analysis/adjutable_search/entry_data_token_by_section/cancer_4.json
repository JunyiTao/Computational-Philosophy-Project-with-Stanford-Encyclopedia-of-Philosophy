    "main_text": "Explaining Cancer: Theories, Models and Mechanisms || The Mechanistic Picture of Cancer\n2.1 The Mechanistic Picture of Cancer\n\nFor most of the last twenty or so years of the 20th Century\nand the first decades of the 21st, the central concern of\nthe majority of cancer researchers has been identification of\nmechanisms at the cell and molecular level that regulate cell birth\nand death. Two characteristic features of cancer cells are their\nuncontrolled growth, and failure to undergo cell death. This is often\nassociated with changes to the \u201ccellular machinery,\u201d or\nmutations and associated disruption of causal pathways that affect\nregulation of cell division or cell death (Hanahan & Weinberg\n2000). The \u201csomatic mutation theory\u201d (sometimes, SMT) or \u201cmultistage\u201d\ntheory of cancer, is roughly the view that changes in cells that lead\nto these disruptions in regulation are due to a series of mutations,\nchromosomal alterations, and epigenetic changes to cells acquired\nduring somatic cell division over the course of a lifetime. Onset of\ncancer, on this view, may be accelerated either by inheritance of\n\u201concogenes\u201d or \u201ctumor suppressors,\u201d or by\ndamage to DNA, for instance, due to smoking or UV radiation.\n\nThis picture of cancer was pieced together over decades from various\nsources of evidence\u2014from Virchow\u2019s observations of\nchromosomal abnormalities in cancer cells, to epidemiological patterns\nof incidence in cancer, to the discovery of the \u201csrc\u201d\ngene\u2014one of the first mutations found to be associated with\ncancer. This vision of cancer as the product of oncogenes replaced a\n\u201cregulatory\u201d view of cancer, according to which cancer was\na \u201cbreakdown in normal constraints on growth\u201d (for a\nhistory, see, e.g., Morange 1993, 1997, 2003). The \u201concogene\nparadigm\u201d arose at the same time that some of the first\nbioengineering technologies, which enabled early cancer researchers to\nuse the techniques of molecular biology to study genes associated with\ncancer progression (Fujimura 1987). While the SMT is often associated\nwith a reductionist research program (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology),\n in the sense that many cancer scientists within this program seek to\ndecompose the system of interest and understand the parts in operation\nin relative isolation, not all early advocates of the multistage\ntheory were cell and molecular biologists. Two of the first advocates\nof the theory\u2014Armitage and Doll\u2014were epidemiologists. They\nfound that curves of average lifetime incidence of lung cancer in\nsmokers appeared to have the same shape as that of nonsmokers, simply\nshifted to earlier ages. This suggested that cancer could arise from a\nrate-limited series of events acquired over the life course. Since it\nwas known that mutations could be acquired during somatic cell\ndivision (where \u201csomatic\u201d mutuations are acquired over the\ncourse of a lifetime, and \u201cheritable\u201d mutations refer to\nmutations in germ cells), and chromosomes of cancer cells were\ndisrupted, the obvious implication seemed to be that cancer cells were\nin part a product of somatic mutations. Since the 1980s, hundreds of\ngenes have been identified, mutations to which are associated with the\nhallmarks of cancer. Carcinogenesis, on this view, results from damage\nto DNA, or errors in the process of cell division, as well as either\nendogenous factors (various hormonal or other factors that promote\ncell growth), or exogenous factors (infection, and inflammation),\nwhich over time can lead to dysregulated cell growth.\n\nIn one paradigmatic example, Vogelstein and his group collected tissue\nsamples (premalignant polyps) from patients with a familial or\ninherited form of bowel cancer (FAP, or familial adenomatous\npolyposis). They discovered that mutations to genes associated with\nvarious cancers accumulated in series of steps, what has been called\nthe \u201cVogelstein cascade.\u201d The study of familial or\nstrongly inherited forms of cancer (cancers that appear at relatively\nyoung ages, and occur in families) has enabled the identification of\nseveral genes, mutations to which (whether inherited or acquired\nduring somatic cell division) play a role in cancer: APC, RB, and p53\n(associated with familial adenomatous polyposis, retinoblastoma, and\nLi Fraumeni syndrome, respectively).\n\nThis picture of explaining cancer might be expected to resonate quite\nwell with the picture of scientific explanation advocated by what has\nbeen called the \u201cnew mechanists.\u201d According to this view,\none of the central aims of biological scientists is the identification\nof mechanisms. The biological sciences do seem to be unique in their\nfocus on mechanisms, rather than laws or general principles, of the\nsort (typically imagined) to be central to the physical sciences (See\nthe entry on\n mechanisms in science).\n A mechanistic explanation identifies parts and processes that\ntypically yield specific outcomes of interest (Machamer, et al. 2000).\nIf we wish to understand regulation of apoptosis (cell death), for\ninstance, we might identify particular genes and proteins that play an\nimportant role in cell senescence, and determine how their activity\nand organization yield (or fail to yield) a given outcome. This\nmechanistic picture of the aims and character of explanation in the\nbiological sciences seems prima facie to characterize current cancer\nresearch quite well, or at least the past 25 years of this\nresearch.\n\nHowever, several philosophers have argued that this picture fails to\ncapture the diverse explanatory strategies carried out by cancer\nscientists (Green, et. al., 2018; see also next section). Indeed, even\nadvocates of the mechanistic perspective have argued that it needs to\nbe amended to accommodate the complex causal processes involved in\ncancer\u2019s etiology. For instance, according to Bechtel (2018), a\nlinear picture of mechanisms for cancer requires\n\u201cexpanding\u201d so as to accommodate the complex organization\nof mechanisms. He characterizes the mechanisms associated with\napoptosis, for instance, as made up of two types:\n\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d mechanisms. Failure to\nrespond to signals promoting apoptosis in cancer may be a result of\ndisruption in either one (or both) such mechanisms. Attention to the\ncomplex negative feedback processes of control and constraint\naffecting primary mechanisms is essential to explaining the emergence\nof cancer. As evidence of the significance of such control mechanisms,\nhe points out how cancer researchers identify regulatory networks or\nfeedback loops, associated with specific functions. Bechtel\u2019s\ndistinction between \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d\nmechanism raises some interesting conceptual and methodological\nquestions about the role of \u201corganization\u201d in functional\nexplanation, and how organization may be key to biological\n\u201cautonomy.\u201d Cancer may be a case study drawing attention\nto the relationships between structural organization and functional\nbehavior in biological systems, tracking insights going back to\nAristotle, and continuing in the work of Kant, Bernard and Piaget\n(see, e.g., Mossio & Bich, 2017; Mossio, et. al., 2009;\nMont\u00e9vil & Mossio 2015).\n\nThe kinds of pathways Bechtel identifies in cancer might either be\nrepresented as \u201cpurposive\u201d in some sense (in that\n\u201ccontroller\u201d versus \u201cprimary\u201d mechanism are\nre-oriented in cancer in service of promoting unlimited growth of\ncells), or as breakdowns in purposive organization (in that these same\nmechanisms typically promote survival of the organism as a whole).\nRelatedly, the same mechanisms might well serve as\n\u201ccontroller\u201d in one context, and \u201cprimary\u201d in\nanother. That is, this distinction itself may be relatively fluid, or\ncontext dependent. In recent work by Bich and Bechtel (2022), and\nothers (see, e.g., Bich, et. al., 2016), this manner in which\norganization and \u2018self-organization\u2019 of biological systems\nis a product or co-regulation of multiple mechanisms, with larger\nimplications for a variety of diferent biological systems, is\ndeveloped further.\n",
