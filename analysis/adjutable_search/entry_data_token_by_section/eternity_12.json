    "main_text": "Arguments for Divine Timelessness || Arguments from Divine Perfection\n6.1 Arguments from Divine Perfection\n\nThere are a number of considerations speaking in favor of divine\ntimelessness that arise out of perfect being theology. Perfect being\ntheology is the approach to theology that involves figuring out what\nGod is like on the basis of God\u2019s being the most perfect (or\ngreatest possible) being. A general argument goes as follows. The most\nperfect being, God, has the most perfect mode of existence. But\ntemporal existence is a less perfect mode of existence than timeless\nexistence. Therefore, God has a timeless mode of existence.\n\nWhy think that temporal existence is less perfect than timeless\nexistence? Note that we\u2019re here mostly concerned with the second\nissue distinguished at the beginning of\n section 4,\n namely the nature of God\u2019s experience (rather than the first,\nnamely whether or not God is located in time/spacetime). The thought\nis that ordinary temporal experience involves gain and loss, and an\nawareness of the inescapable passage of time. Relatedly, for ordinary\ntemporal beings, neither the distant past nor the future are\nperceptually accessible. We remember parts of the past, but\nimperfectly, and we merely anticipate the future. We know much less\nabout the future than the past. We can\u2019t change or re-experience\nthe past, nor can we skip ahead to later moments, except one at a\ntime.\n\nBut then again, God is no ordinary temporal being. The defender of\ntemporality can reply that while God\u2019s life has temporal\nfeatures, in that God experiences succession, God\u2019s temporal\nexperience is otherwise very much unlike ours (Mullins 2014). For\nexample, God is omniscient, so God forgets no part of the past and\nalready knows all about the future. It\u2019s true that experiencing\nsuccession means experiencing things one at a time. But, the defender\nof temporality might add, this very feature is necessary for, e.g.,\nthe ability to enjoy music, which is good and therefore something the\nmost perfect being would have.\n\nThere are more indirect ways of arguing from perfection to\ntimelessness. For example, suppose that the most perfect mode of\nexistence involves immutability, and that immutability requires\ntimelessness. Or suppose that perfection requires divine simplicity,\nand that simplicity requires timelessness (for more, see the SEP\nentries on\n divine simplicity\n and\n immutability).\n",
