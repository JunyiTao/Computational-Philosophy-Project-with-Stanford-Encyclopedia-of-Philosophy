    "main_text": "The Ancient Background and the Formation of the Concept\n1. The Ancient Background and the Formation of the Concept\n\nThe English words \u2018representation\u2019 and \u2018to\nrepresent\u2019 derive via Old French from the Latin words\n\u2018repraesentatio\u2019 and \u2018repraesentare,\u2019 but\nthese are by no means commonly used words in classical Latin. In late\nancient thought it is foremost Quintilian and Tertullian that uses the\nterms in a philosophically interesting way. It was not until the\ntwelfth century Latin translation of Avicenna\u2019s De\nanima that these terms became frequently used in connection with\ncognition and the mind or the intellective soul (see Lagerlund\n2007b).\n\nThe Latin translators of Avicenna rendered several related terms in\nArabic all related to cognition and the internal senses with the Latin\n\u2018repraesentatio\u2019. In doing so they, intentionally or not,\nformed the concept of representations in the soul. Representation in\nthe Latin translation of Avicenna is associated with all five\nfaculties. Forms received through the common sense and stored in the\nphantasia are called representations. The imaginative or cogitative\nfaculty combines and divides representations collected in the\nphantasia to make new representations, which might not have any real\nobject corresponding to them. The senses apprehend the sensible forms\nof the objects perceived and the estimative faculty apprehends the\n\u2018intentio\u2019 or \u2018ma\u2019na\u2019 of the perceived\nobject. Representations in the imagination are also the basis for\nintellectual activity, according to this view of cognition:\n\nIn the intellect, the form of animal is of the sort that agrees with\none and the same definition of many particular [things]. Thus, one\nform in the intellect will be related to many things, and it is in\nthis respect that it is universal, because it is one intention in the\nintellect \u2026 which is evident since, of those [things]\nrepresented by the form in the imagination, the intellect has\nplundered the intention of its accidents [and] acquired the form in\nthe intellect. (Liber de philosophia prima sive scientia\ndivina V, cap. 1, p. 237)\n\n\nAvicenna here describes the process of abstraction, or how the\nrepresentation in the imagination of particular things becomes\nuniversal in the intellect. The universal forms are abstracted from\nrepresentations in the imagination and flow from the active intellect\ninto the passive. Note, however, that the terminology of\nrepresentation is never used in relation to the intellect. It is\nalways the internal senses that represent in Avicenna and not the\nintellect or the external senses (see Lagerlund 2007b, for a table of\nthe whole range of terms translated by \u2018representation\u2019 in\nAvicenna\u2019s works.)\n\nOne of the reasons \u2018representation\u2019 is only used for the\ninternal senses is that representations are thought of as images. The\nnotion of linguistic representations or representations as signs is\nnot present in Avicenna\u2019s work or any other work of the time. It\nseems instead to derive from logic. Early logic works like Garlandus\nCompotista\u2019s Dialectica (17) and Abelard\u2019s\nDialectica (II, 188) discussed a distinction between a\nword\u2019s signification by imposition and representation. A\ndenominative term such as \u2018white\u2019 signifies by imposition\na substance that is white, but it signifies by representation the\nwhiteness inhering in the substance. The white thing stands in for or\nis an instantiation of whiteness; white is re-presented in the object.\nGarlandus mentions the example of a traveler\n(\u2018viator\u2019) who can be said to represent a road\n(\u2018via\u2019). The term \u2018traveler\u2019\nsignifies by imposition the human being who is a traveler, but also\nrepresents the road the traveler travels on. It is exactly this usage\nof representation applied to mental signs that becomes important with\nOckham and Buridan.\n",
