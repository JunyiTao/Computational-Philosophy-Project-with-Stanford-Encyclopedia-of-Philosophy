    "main_text": "\n\nEvaluative terms and concepts are often divided into\n\u201cthin\u201d and \u201cthick\u201d. We don\u2019t evaluate\nactions and persons merely as good or bad, or right or wrong, but also\nas kind, courageous, tactful, selfish, boorish, and cruel. The latter\nare examples of thick concepts, the general class of which includes\nvirtue and vice concepts such as generous and\nselfish, practical concepts such as shrewd\nand imprudent,\nepistemic concepts such as open-minded and\ngullible, and aesthetic concepts such as banal\nand gracious. These\nconcepts stand in an intuitive contrast to those we typically express\nwhen we use thin terms such as right, bad,\npermissible, and ought. (Concepts are often regarded\nas non-linguistic representational items that can serve as the\nmeanings of linguistic expressions and as constituents of\npropositions; terms are linguistic items that can be used to express\nconcepts. The precise relation between concepts and language may be\ncomplicated, however. In what follows, small capitals denote concepts\nand italics denote terms.) Typically when someone calls an action bad,\nthey evaluate it negatively without committing themselves to much if\nanything by way of non-evaluative description. This descriptive\nthinness of bad makes it more general than\nselfish or cruel. Even\nif calling something selfish evaluates it as bad in some way or\nrespect, not just any bad act can count as selfish; it must also\ninvolve the agent giving a certain degree of priority to herself over\nothers. So the application of thick terms and concepts seems somehow\nto involve both evaluation and non-evaluative description.\n\nIt is primarily this combination of evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription that has attracted philosophical attention to thick\nconcepts in ethics since the mid-twentieth century. Thick concepts\nhave been thought to provide leverage in various debates concerning\nthe nature of evaluative thought and talk and to illuminate such\nquestions as whether there is a robust fact-value distinction, whether\nethical claims enjoy a significant kind of objectivity, and how\nevaluative classifications relate to non-evaluative classifications.\nDoing justice to the full diversity and complexity of moral thinking\nhas also been thought to require more attention to thick concepts. The\nfocus on thin concepts over the thick in much of the history of\nWestern moral philosophy threatens to simplify and mislead also in\nnormative ethics, where the revival of virtue ethics as a major\nalternative to deontology and consequentialism coincides with\nincreased attention to thick terms and concepts in metaethics.\nInterest in thick concepts has also extended from ethics to other\nareas of philosophy such as epistemology and aesthetics. Several\nquestions run through all these motivations for focusing on thick\nconcepts. We have a \u201ccombination question\u201d: how exactly do\nthick terms and concepts combine evaluation and non-evaluative\ndescription? We have a \u201clocation question\u201d: is evaluation\nsomehow inherent to thick terms and concepts, such as perhaps an\naspect of their meaning, or merely a feature of their use? We have a\n\u201cdelineation question\u201d: how do thick terms differ from the\nthin and from other kinds of evaluative terms (such as pejorative\nexpressions)? Given answers to these questions, what broader\nsignificance within ethics and applications outside of ethics might\nthick ethical concepts have? What follows is a survey of various\nattempts to answer these questions.\n",
