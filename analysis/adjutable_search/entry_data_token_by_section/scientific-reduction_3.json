If we add the remarks\nNagel opened his discussion on reduction with\u2014namely, that\nreduction has to be understood as a certain kind of explanation (1961:\n338)\u2014the core idea of the Nagel model is fully characterized.\nAdding Nagel\u2019s idea of reduction as a kind of explanation, the\nso called \u201cNagel model of reduction\u201d can be fully\nspecified as follows: Reduction is (i) a kind of explanation relation,\nwhich (ii) holds between two theories if and only if (iii) one of\nthese theories is derivable from the other, (iv) with the help of\nbridge laws under some conditions. The basic model covers two sorts of\nreduction, one in which bridge laws are not required (homogeneous\ncases) and one in which they are (nonhomogeneous cases; for a\npresentation of homogeneous cases of reductions and the question of\nwhether or not alleged cases of reductions really should count as\nreductions in the Nagelian sense, see the entry on\n intertheory relations in physics).\n Nagel conceives of sciences or theories as developing entities that\nundergo changes, across which their vocabulary remains unchanged\n(though it is, presumably, sometimes extended). These successive\nstates of theories are covered by the notion of homogeneous\nreductions\u2014deduction of an early stage from a later stage of a\ntheory is possible without bridge laws since they share a common\nvocabulary. Nonhomogeneous cases of reduction hold between pairs of\ndifferent theories, employing different vocabularies. Whereas the\nformer variant of reduction did not attract much attention (by Nagel\nand others), the latter has been a subject of intense discussion since\nNagel introduced it in 1949.\n2.2.2 Direct and indirect reduction\n\nThe Nagel model of reduction parallels the so called \u201cdeductive\nnomological model\u201d (DN-model) of explanation according to which\nexplaining some fact involves showing how its truth can be deduced\nfrom a set of other truths containing at least some laws. For example\naccording to the DN model, one explains the acceleration of a falling\nbody by showing how it can be deduced from Newton\u2019s laws. The\nNagel model of reduction thus seems to suggest that a reduced theory\nis directly explained by the corresponding reducing\ntheory.\n\nIn this sense, Nagel reduction is sometimes (cf. Schaffner 1967: 137,\n1993: 423) interpreted as a kind of direct reduction, in\ncontrast with indirect reductions\u2014those that hold in\nvirtue of the fact that the reducing theory explains the occurrence of\nthe phenomena of the reduced theory (rather than the reduced theory\nitself)\u2014a view associated with Kemeny and Oppenheim (1956) and\nFriedman (1982), and captured as one variant of reduction by\nSchaffner\u2019s model (Schaffner 1993).\n\nHowever, some have argued that the distinction itself may not be\nviable (van Riel 2011). First, it is not clear what it is to explain a\ntheory (except for explaining it to, say, a student). Second, the\nexamples Nagel discusses suggest that he believed his model to be\nindirect\u2014an \u201cexplanation\u201d of a theory in\nterms of derivation from a reducing theory amounts to using the\nreducing theory to explain the phenomena dealt with by the reduced\ntheory.\n2.2.3 Bridge principles\n\nNagel\u2019s major (and perhaps most controversial) contribution was\nthe introduction of bridge principles. The notion of bridge\nprinciples, (also: \u2018bridge laws\u2019 and \u2018coordinating\ndefinitions\u2019) can be spelled out in several different ways. The\nmost common way in accord with Nagel (1961: chap. 11, Sec. II.3) is to\ndescribe them syntactically as bi-conditionals linking terms in the\nvocabularies of the two theories. In the same context, however, Nagel\ndescribes them in terms of the \u2018nature of the linkages\npostulated\u2019 (Nagel 1961: 354). He distinguishes three such\nlinkages:\n\n The links mimicked by the bridge laws are \u2018logical\nconnections\u2019 (1961: 354), which are understood as meaning\nconnections.\n The links postulated by bridge laws are conventions or\nstipulations (\u2018deliberate fiat\u2019; 1961: 354).\n The links postulated by bridge laws are \u2018factual or\nmaterial\u2019 (1961: 354); that is, bridge laws state empirical\nfacts (these truths are then described as empirical hypotheses).\n\n\nThese alternatives characterize bridge laws semantically in ways that\nseem more fundamental than their syntactic status and role in\nderivation. There is a gap between characterizing a sentence as a\nbi-conditional and as postulating the relevant sort of link.\nBi-conditionals in themselves can express nothing other than truth\nfunctional relations, and real bridge laws cannot be defined in purely\nsyntactic terms. Bi-conditionals are rendered true by a great variety\nof \u201clinks\u201d (but \u2018being rendered true by\u2019 is\nnot to be conflated with \u2018postulating\u2019): contingent\nco-instantiation or co-occurrence is not enough for reduction, even\nthough it is enough for some bi-conditionals to hold (and, therefore,\nfor some pairs of\u2014possible\u2014theories to instantiate the\nofficial Nagel model). Therefore, logical form (in first-order\npredicate logic) is not what we should focus on when we consider the\nsyntactic nature of bridge laws. But what, then, is the relevant\ncharacterization? This is a matter of dispute among Nagel interpreters\nand those who refined the Nagel-model. Some tend to suggest weaker\nnotions, such as (nomologically necessary) co-instantiation or\nco-relation (Dizadji Bahmani et al. 2010, also discussed in Klein 2009\nand Kim 1998: 90, 2008), whereas others suggest stronger\ninterpretations in terms of nomic conections or identities (Sklar\n1967; Schaffner 1993; Esfeld & Sachse 2007; van Riel 2011).\n\nIn Nagel 1970, he explicitly states that bridge-laws state identities\nof the properties signified by the relevant predicates or nomic\nrelations among extensions. If bridge laws should thus be conceived of\nas stating identities or relations among the relevant terms\u2019\nextensions, then clearly reduction on such a view incorporates\nessential reference to the theories\u2019 ontologies and is more than\njust a two-place relation holding among theories.\n\nConsider the following passage:\n\n\nIn \u2026 cases [of reduction in which the vocabularies of the two\nrelata of the reduction relation differ], the distinctive traits that\nare the subject matter of the [reduced] science fall into the province\nof a theory that may have been initially designed for handling\nqualitatively different materials\u2026. The [reducing] science thus\nseems to wipe out familiar distinctions as spurious, and appears to\nmaintain that what are prima facie indisputably different traits of\nthings are really identical. (Nagel 1961: 340)\n\n\nThus, Nagel-reduction is a relation that holds not just between\ntheories but also between their ontologies. Sometimes, however, the\nNagel model has been characterized as an epistemological\nmodel of reduction, because it is a model of theory-reduction (Sarkar\n1992; Hoyningen-Huene 1989; Silberstein 2002), because it is a model\nof explanatory reduction (Sarkar 1992), or because bridge-laws are to\nbe interpreted epistemologically (Fazekas 2009, following Klein\n2009).\n2.2.4 Arbitrary and non-arbitrary reductions\n\nFinally, it is worth noticing that Nagel introduces a distinction\nbetween arbitrary and non-arbitrary reductions: These criteria are\n\u201cnon-formal\u201d (1961: chap. 11, Sec. III). The first\ncriterion Nagel mentions is that the premises of a reduction\u2014the\nbridge laws and the reducing theory\u2014should be well established\nrather than arbitrarily chosen (1961: 358). Second, Nagel alludes to\nthe fact that the reducing theory should be better established than\nthe reduced one. The third criterion states that reduction is\nconcerned with unification. The fourth criterion states that the\nreducing theory corrects and augments the reduced theory.\n\nIdeas similar to those of Nagel have been pursued, amongst others, by\nRobert Causey and Lawrence Sklar (Sklar 1967). Causey\u2019s model of\nmicroreductions suggests that reductions are based in cross-theoretic\nidentities and are, in a sense, decompositional (Causey 1972a,b).\nKenneth Schaffner explicitly built upon Nagel\u2019s model, extending\nit especially to cover cases of correction and replacement.\n2.2.5 Reduction and replacement\n\nKenneth Schaffner explicitly built upon Nagel\u2019s model, with a\nspecial focus on extending it to cover cases of correction and\nreplacement. Appealing to the facts of actual scientific theory\nsuccession, Schaffner proposed an alternative model of reduction\n(Schaffner 1993: chapter 9; earlier versions can be found in his 1967,\n1974, and 1976) based on the following main idea: If we want our\ndefinition to cover the relevant sort of cases of actual scientific\ndevelopments, we must not focus solely on straightforward reductions;\nmere replacements and cases of theory-correction should be\nincorporated as well because (most, or at least a considerable number\nof) actual theory-successions do not fit into the picture of\nreductions in the more narrow sense (see, for example, Schaffner 1993:\n426, 427f).\n\nIt thereby reflects the most powerful criticism that has been raised\nagainst the Nagel-model (see\n Section 5.3).\n Schaffner proposes a complex definition comprising several disjuncts,\nwhich are intended to encompass both genuine reductions and different\nsorts of replacement ranging from complete replacements via a\ncontinuum of relations to cases of correction fully within the reduced\ntheory. Schaffner notes in many cases what gets strictly reduced in\nintermediate cases is not the original theory but a corrected version\nof that theory constructed within the vocabulary of the reducing\ntheory.\n2.3 Problems for Nagelian models of reduction\n\nMany criticisms have been raised against both the original Nagel model\nand its variants. The original Nagel model was faulted as too narrow\nbecause it allows only for theory reduction (Wimsatt 1972; Hull 1976;\nDarden & Maull 1977: 43; Sarkar 1992), whereas an appropriate\nmodel would cover cases of reduction of mere models and the\nlike\u2014sciences like biology and neuroscience should be regarded\nas being possible candidates for reduction, although they do not\ncontain full-fledged theories (see also the entry on\n reductionism in biology;\n for a discussion of this and the following criticisms, see van Riel\n2011).\n\nIn a more general sense, the Nagel model has been criticized as\nexemplifying all the shortcomings of the orthodox view on science. For\nexample, it conceives of theories as syntactic entities, and it views\nreduction as explanation cashed out in terms of the DN model (Hempel\n& Oppenheim 1948), which has itself been challenged on many\ngrounds, especially those regarding the asymmetry of explanation (for\nan overview that focuses on problems arising from reduction as\nexplanation, see Craver (2007: chap. 2), and for problems concerning\nthe DN model, see Salmon 1989).\n\nThe Nagel model describes reduction in terms of direct theory\nexplanation, whereas an appropriate model of reduction should shape\nthe notion in terms of indirect theory explanation, that is, in terms\nof explanation of the phenomena of a theory (Kemeny & Oppenheim\n1956; Schaffner 1967; Friedman 1982).\n\nThree formal worries of the Nagel model merit mention: if reduction is\nderivation plus (sometimes) bridge laws, then any theory would reduce\nto itself (because any theory is derivable from itself); moreover, any\ntheory would reduce to any inconsistent theory; and contrary to what\none might expect, reduction would not turn out to be an asymmetric\nrelation\u2014derivability does not entail asymmetry.\n\nFeyerabend (1962, 1966), Churchland (1986), Schaffner (1993), and\nBickle (1998), amongst others, have argued that Nagel\u2019s model\nallows neither for correction in the reducing theory nor for\nreplacement, and that, therefore, it is fundamentally misguided.\nRecall, however, that Nagel suggests that at least some interesting\nreductions involve correction. He writes that:\n\n\n[t]he [reducing] theory must also be fertile in usable suggestions for\ndeveloping the secondary science, and must yield theorems referring to\nthe latter\u2019s subject matter which augment or correct its\ncurrently accepted body of laws. (Nagel 1961: 360)\n\n\nAt first sight, it is not clear how correction is possible if\ndeduction is the basis for reduction. The truth of the reducing\ntheories entails the truth of the reduced theories. This is what\ndeduction is about. So, it is worth noting that Nagel introduced this\ncriterion, even though it seems hardly compatible with his official\nmodel. However, as suggested by Putnam (1965: 206ff., esp. n. 3),\nthere are a number of ways to incorporate correction within\nNagel\u2019s model: by speaking of approximate truth, by\ncontextualizing the reduced theory, or by introducing probabilistic\nnotions. Moreover, in discussing Feyerabend\u2019s criticisms based\non the alleged incommensurability of expressions in different\nsciences, Nagel explicitly stated that reductions may rely on\napproximations (1970: 120\u201321, 133). A similar idea seems tied to\nNagel\u2019s suggestion that some reductions may require boundary\nconditions (Nagel 1961: 434) in order to connect the relevant kind\nterms in an appropriate bridge law, thereby altering and adjusting one\nof the terms\u2019 extensions. As has been pointed out by Endicott\n(1998), any account that allows for boundary conditions, correction,\napproximation and the like (such as the account proposed by Schaffner)\nwill be able to cover such cases. Kemeny and Oppenheim suggest that\nidealization may be justified in developing models of reduction,\nnoting that without idealization things would become \u201chopelessly\ncomplex\u201d (Kemeny & Oppenheim 1956: 13).\n\nFinally, Nagel\u2019s model has been criticized for the role it\nattributes to bridge-laws. New Wave reductionists in particular have\nargued that bridge-laws do not play the role they are supposed to play\nin discovering reduction-relations. Contrary to Nagel, we do not use\nbridge-laws when discovering for example that parts of chemistry\nreduce to atomic physics. Rather, we infer bridge-laws from the\ndiscovery of relevant similarities between the two theories (for the\nexplanatory role of bridge-laws and identity statements, see also\nMarras (2005: 351) and Block & Stalnaker (1999: 28)).\n\nIn response to those critiques, some, like Schaffner and\nDizadji-Bahmani et al. (2010) and Butterfield (2011a&b) have\ndeveloped variants of the Nagel model that retain its spirit but avoid\nmany of the problems faced by the original. Prominent suggestions\nconcern refinements of the logical framework in which Nagelian\nreduction is described (Dizadji-Bahmani, Frigg, and Hartmann (2010)\nand Butterfield (2011a)) as well as a relaxation of the condition that\nreductions must be complete. The idea is that even in physics,\nreductions are \u201cmost likely partial, and thus not fully\nsystematic\u201d (Schaffner 2012: 559). As Schaffner observed, even\n\u201calmost sweeping reductions\u201d (Schaffner 2006: 379) in\nphysics, such as the reduction of physical optics by Maxwell\u2019s\nelectromagnetic theory, fail at some point. Partial reductions are\nconceived of as \u201clargely completed reductions containing\nexceptions or failures of attempted reductions\u201d (Schaffner 2012:\n563). An interpretation of partial reductions for sciences such as\nbiology has been developed in Schaffner (2006) and further developed\nby Winther (2009). His suggestion heavily draws on explanatory notions\nand mereological relations: In a partial reduction, the objects\nreferred to in the explanans are parts, or a microstructure of the\nphenomenon to be explained. The phenomenon to be explained is a\nmacro-object. The microstructure needs to be linked via\n\u201cconnectability assumptions\u201d to the macro-object. These\nassumptions may suggest causal links or, in more straightforward\ncases, identity. Such explanations may turn out to be partial for\nvarious reasons: For example, they often do not explain all cases of\nthe target phenomenon, the reduction base may span levels of\norganization, and they may fall short of straightforward derivations\nof the target phenomenon. Such partial reductions share important\nfeatures with mechanistic explanations; for example, they are local,\npostulate a causal mechanism that is responsible for the occurrence of\nthe target phenomenon, refer to constituents in the explanation, and\nmay span different levels.\n\nPartial reductions thus allow for emergence; we get a partial\nreduction only, some aspects of the target phenomenon are emergent. On\nSchaffner\u2019s interpretation, this sort of emergence is purely\npragmatic (Schaffner 2006: 382).\n\nOthers have rejected the Nagel model and used different frameworks to\naccount for reduction. The most relevant alternatives will be\ndiscussed in the next sections.\n2.4 Structuralist models of reduction\n\nOne alleged problem of Nagelian models is that they start from a\nmistaken background view of science in that they conceive of theories\nas syntactic objects and rely on dubious notions about the nature of\nlaws and theoretical terms. Structuralists tried to overcome these\nalleged problems (as well as others, such as the problem of\nincommensurability) by revising the notion of a theory.\n\nPart of the classical structuralist program consists in the idea that\nphilosophy of science, properly construed, pursues an ideal of\nrational reconstruction of science (cf. Stegm\u00fcller 1979; Balzer\n1984: 331), which is to be understood as a reconstruction of actual\nscientific developments. Since it is common knowledge that cases of\nstraightforward reductions are rare, if they exist at all,\nstructuralists focused primarily on cases of mere replacement or on\nsimilarities between theories, which are cashed out in terms of\napproximation or (semantic counterparts of) derivation under ideal\nconditions (Moulines 1984; Scheibe 1999; Stegm\u00fcller 1979 &\n1986: ch. 4).\n\nAccording to the structuralist picture (Sneed 1971; further developed\nin: Stegm\u00fcller 1979), to give an account of a theory T is\nto define the predicate \u2018_is a (model of) T\u2019 in\nset-theoretical terms. A theory basically consists of a set M,\na set of potential models MP, a set of potential partial models\nMPP and a set of intended applications I, which is\nsupposed to be \u201copen\u201d, or non-extensionally individuated.\nThe relation between the different variants or stages of I is,\nas Stegm\u00fcller suggests, best thought of as being pragmatically\nfixed (Stegm\u00fcller 1979). Building on such a notion of a theory,\nPatrick Suppes proposes the following characterization of inter-theory\nreduction:\n\n\nMany of the problems formulated in connection with the question of\nreducing one science to another may be formulated as a series of\nproblems using the notion of a representation theorem for the models\nof a theory. For instance, the thesis that psychology may be reduced\nto physiology would be for many people appropriately established if\none could show that, for any model of a psychological theory, it was\npossible to construct an isomorphic model within physiological theory.\n(Suppes 1967: 59)\n\n\nThese set-theoretical structures are then used to define a reduction\nrelation in terms of mapping functions from one structure to another.\nIt is worth noting, however, that structuralists believed their models\nof reduction to be advantageous because they believed their\nconcept of a theory to be more appropriate. The general status of\nstructuralism is an important factor in assessing the problems these\nmodels of reduction seem to face.\n2.5 Problems for structuralist models of reduction\n\nSchaffner has argued that the structuralist notion of reduction is too\nweak a notion to be useful, and that (official) Nagelian reduction is\na special case of Suppes\u2019 model. That is, whenever there is a\nNagel-reduction, then there is a Suppes-reduction. Moreover, according\nto Schaffner, Suppes\u2019 model covers cases that should not be\ncovered, namely, arbitrary reductions (Schaffner 1967). Similar\nproblems arise for successors of Suppes\u2019 model that try to cash\nout reduction in terms of an isomorphism or an analogy-relation, which\nhave been developed and refined by Sneed (1971) and Stegm\u00fcller\n(1979). The basic problem of these accounts has been described by\nMoulines (1984: 55) and a similar idea can be found in Hoering (1984).\nMoulines puts it as follows:\n\n\nThere is at least one further aspect of reduction that is overlooked\nby [the structuralist conception]. This is what I would like to call\n\u201cthe ontological aspect\u201d. I wish to argue that, for a\ncomplete picture of a reductive relationship between two theories, one\nhas to take into account some sort of relation between the respective\ndomains. Otherwise, when confronted with a particular example of a\nreductive pair, we would feel that all we have is an ad hoc\nmathematical relationship between two sets of structures, perhaps by\nchance having the mathematical properties we require of reduction but\nnot really telling something about \u201cthe world\u201d. We could\nhave a reductive relationship between two theories that are completely\nalien to each other. (Moulines 1984: 55)\n\n\nThus, the problem is that mere structural similarity does not\nguarantee that both theories are actually concerned with the same\nphenomena, or the same properties. This is a problem Nagelian models\ndo not face if they describe bridge-laws in semantic terms, i.e., in\nterms of extensional or intensional relations among the relevant\npredicates or kind terms. Relatively independent of structuralist\nmodels, philosophers who work at the interface of the philosophy of\nmind and the philosophy of science have developed accounts that later\nhave been labeled \u2018New Wave\u2019 reductionism.\n2.6 \u201cNew Wave\u201d-models of reduction\n\nRelatively independent of structuralist models, philosophers who work\nat the interface of the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of\nscience have developed accounts that have come to be known as\n\u2018New Wave\u2019 reductionism.\n\nNew Wave reductionists take it that their models give an appropriate\nreconstruction of a specific kind of scientific development\n(Churchland 1986: 279ff.; Bickle 1998: chapter 1). At the same time,\nhowever, this movement is associated with a reductionist metaphysical\nposition. Arguing that neuroscience reduces or eliminates psychology,\nsome protagonists try to show that we should embrace an eliminative\nform of reductionism about the mind (e.g., Paul Churchland 1981, 1985;\nPatricia Churchland 1986; Bickle 1998). Thus, there is a tendency to\ncontinue debates originating from the philosophy of mind tradition.\nThe so called New Wave model (or better: a family of similar models),\nwhich was developed in a series of articles and books by Clifford\nHooker (1981), Paul Churchland (1979, 1985) and more recently John\nBickle (esp. 1998), builds on some aspects of Schaffner\u2019s\ncurrent model (1993) and its earlier versions (Schaffner 1967, 1974,\n1976). Here is a formulation of Hooker\u2019s definition:\n\n\nWithin TB construct an analog, T*R, of TR under\ncertain conditions CR such that TB and CR entail\nT*R and argue that the analog relation, AR, between\nT*R and TR warrants claiming (some kind of) reduction\nrelation, R, between TR and TB. Thus (TB\n& CR \u2192 T*R) and (T*R AR\nTR) warrants (TB R TR). (Hooker 1981:\n49)\n\n\nThe conditions, CR, will consist of limiting assumptions and\nboundary conditions that guarantee that if TB is more\ncomprehensive than TR, the application of elements of\nTB\u2019s vocabulary is restricted to the domain relevant for\nTR. The idea is to effect reductions that include corrections\nby working on the reducing theory (here \u2018TB\u2019) and\nnot by working with corrections formulated in the vocabulary of the\nreduced theory. Ronald Endicott (1998: 56) identifies four core\naspects of New Wave reduction: (i) \u201cNew Wave\nconstruction\u201d: the corrected version of the reduced theory is\nconstructed within the vocabulary of the reducing theory; (ii)\n\u201cNew Wave deduction\u201d: this corrected version is deduced\nfrom the reducing theory; (iii) \u201cNew Wave relation\u201d:\nanalogical relations play the role bridge-laws play within Nagelian\nmodels; (iv) \u201cNew Wave continuum\u201d: these analogical\nrelations may differ in degree of strength\u2014reductions based on\nstrong analogical relations justify a conservative stand towards the\n(ontology of) the reduced science, whereas reductions based on weak\nanalogical relations justify elimination. Identity (a limiting case\nfor the continuum), for example, ensures that the ontology of the\nreduced theory is preserved by the reducing theory.\n\nSo, what is the basic refinement of New Wave reduction? According to\nBickle (1998: 29 & 1992: 224) and Paul Churchland (1985: 11),\navoiding reference to bridge-principles has a great epistemological\nadvantage: The epistemological virtue of reduction does not depend\nupon knowledge of bridge-principles. Rather, comparison of reduced and\nreducing theories justifies identity claims.\n\nNew Wave reductionists typically allow for a great variety of\nrelations backing up the analogical relation established between\nTR and TR*. In New Wave reduction, bridge-laws are\nreplaced by ordered pairs of elements of the descriptive parts of the\nvocabularies of the two theories, which enable us to judge the degree\nof similarity between the derived image (which is formulated in the\nlanguage of the reducing theory) and the reduced theory (Bickle 1992:\n223). Reduction is associated with a space of theory-relations ranging\nfrom \u201cperfectly smooth\u201d or \u201cretentive\u201d\nreductions to \u201cbumpy\u201d reductions, which are best\nunderstood as mere replacements (Bickle 1992: 223; Hooker 1981: 45).\nBickle describes smooth reductions as follows:\n(\u2018IN\u2019 designates the derived image and\n\u2018TO\u2019 designates the reduced or the\n\u201cold\u201d theory):\n\n\nIn cases lying at or near the retentive endpoint, the IN is the\nexactly equipotent isomorphic image of the TO, and no\ncounterfactual limiting assumptions or boundary conditions are\nrequired for the derivation of IN. (Bickle 1992: 223)\n\n\nIn this case, the pairing of the terms corresponds to identity of\nreferents (Bickle 1992: 224) and IN can be directly obtained\nfrom TR (the reducing theory), whereas in cases on the opposite\npoint of the spectrum, pairing is achieved only by reference to\ncounterfactual limiting assumptions and boundary conditions. In this\ncase, ontology is eliminated, as in the reduction of phlogiston-theory\ncase.\n2.7 Problems for \u201cNew Wave\u201d-models of reduction\n\nThe main criticism raised against New Wave reductionism has been that\nit either misses the target of reduction, or that it is not new at\nall. Ronald Endicott argues that New Wave reductionists fail to\nrecognize the important distinction between mere replacements\non the one hand (that correspond to eliminativism, rather than\nreductionism), and proper reductions on the other (Endicott 1998,\n2001). Insofar as New Wave reductionists conceive of reduction in\nterms of replacement, they just miss the target. If they conceive of\nreduction in terms of smooth reductions, then, basically, they repeat\nthe Nagelian model in new terminology. A similar point has been made\nby Dizadji Bahmani et al. (2010). The authors point out that,\nespecially when Schaffner\u2019s model is conceived of as being\nbasically Nagelian in spirit, New Wave reductionism just is Nagelian\nreduction.\n\nEndicott as well as Dizadji Bahmani et al. (2010) argue that the sole\ndifference between the classical Nagel-model and New Wave reduction is\nthat New Wave reductionists highlight the procedural aspect of how\nreductions are carried out\u2014or of how scientists may argue that\nreduction-relations are instantiated, whereas Nagel was mostly\nconcerned with questions regarding the relation that is so discovered.\nHow scientists may arrive the truth of bridge-principles is a question\ndifferent from the question as to the nature of bridge-principles.\n2.8 Reduction and mechanisms\n\nThe recent debate on mechanistic explanation took its point of\ndeparture in reflections on sciences other than physics. Most\nproponents of a mechanistic turn in the philosophy of explanation\noppose a number of mainstream interpretations of core notions in the\nphilosophy of science, especially that of a scientific explanation, a\nlaw, the layer-cake model of a hierarchy of sciences (Wimsatt 1976),\nand the notion of a theory. Most often, mechanistic explanation is\ncharacterized as (i) being related to the use of \u2018by\u2019\nrather than \u2018because\u2019 (Craver 2007), (ii) being such that\nthe functioning of a complex entity is explained in terms of the\ncoordinated activation of its constituents, (iii) by being tied to a\nhierarchical order of local mechanisms, whose constituents can\nthemselves become the target of a mechanistic explanation, and (iv) by\nthe relevance of the notion of organization\u2014mechanisms are\norganized to do something. This is how Craver puts it:\n\n\nMechanistic explanations are constitutive or componential\nexplanations: they explain the behavior of the mechanism as a whole in\nterms of the organized activities and interactions of its components.\n(Craver 2007: 128)\n\n\nA number of aspects concerning the relation between reduction and\nmechanistic explanation are dealt with in the entry on\n reductionism in biology.\n Thus, suffice it to say that some philosophers, like Craver, reject a\nreductionist interpretation of mechanistic explanation (Craver 2007),\nwhereas others seem to suggest that a conservative form of\nreductionism may be compatible with mechanistic explanation (Bechtel\n2007 and, especially, Schaffner 2006). Interestingly, the example of\nthe reduction of headaches as described by Nagel (see above,\n Section 1)\n seems to suggest that he conceives of reductive explanation as\nmechanistic explanation. This is consonant with his first publication\non reduction: In his early paper on reduction (Nagel 1935), he\ndescribes reduction as a constitution relation. Van Riel (2014)\nsuggests that reductive explanation is a cognate of mechanistic\nexplanation.\n2.9 Reduction and causation\n\nMechanistic explanation is non-causal, and so is reductive\nexplanation. However, sometimes, reductionist models are phrased in\ncausal terminology. En\u00e7 (1976) is a case in point. He describes\nreductive explanation and reductive dependence as causal. The\ndescription he gives of this relation, however, does not fit the usual\nuse of the term \u2018causation\u2019. En\u00e7 describes it as a\n\u2018generative\u2019 relation that may hold between an object\na and an object b even if a=b. Hence,\ndespite the fact that he uses the term \u2018causation\u2019, he\nshould not be interpreted as stating that literally, reductive\nexplanation is causal explanation. This has been overlooked by\nSchaffner (1993) who reflects upon En\u00e7\u2019s description,\ncriticizing him for assuming that reduction is causation.\n3. Models of scientific reduction in the philosophy of mind\n\nReductionist positions have gained attention within the philosophy of\nmind in four main respects. Firstly, type-identity theory was proposed\nas a reductionist position about the mind. Secondly, token-identity\ntheories are sometimes conceived of as being reductionist in spirit as\nwell. Thirdly, models of functional reduction have been intensively\ndiscussed. And, finally and corresponding to the previous\ndistinctions, there are different conceptions of reduction that are\ndiscussed and rejected by non-reductive physicalism.\n3.1 Type-identity theories\n\nType-identity theory claims that for types of some domain\nD1, (e.g., psychology) there are types of a domain\nD2 (e.g., neuroscience) such that for any member\nx of D1, there is a member y of\nD2 such that x=y. This aspect is\nrevealed in the theory\u2019s name\u2014it is type-identity\ntheory. It is not just the items falling under the types that are said\nto be identical but also the types themselves; e.g., being a pain is\nsaid to be the very same type as being a certain pattern of neural\nfiring. However, just to claim that for any type x of some\ndomain D1, there is a type y of a domain\nD2 such that x=y does not make you a\ntype-identity theorist. Rather, it is a specific reductionist as well\nas a naturalist stance that accompany these identity-claims that make\nthem proper \u201ctype-identity\u201d claims.\n\nThe main concern was to defend this position against various\ncounterarguments. The question of what exactly makes this position\nreductive did not receive considerable attention. Primarily,\nthis theory is a monistic theory; but monism is not identical to\nreductionism. Herbert Feigl gives the following characterization of\ntype-identity theory when answering the question of \u201cwhether the\nmental and the physical can in some sense be identified\u201d:\n\n\n[I]t is proper to speak of \u201cidentification [\u2026]\u201d.\nConcepts of molar behavior theory like habit strength, expectancy,\ndrive, instinct, memory trace, repression, superego, etc., may yet be\nidentified in a future psychophysiology with specific types of\nneural-structure-and-process patterns. (Feigl 1967: 77)\n\n\nThis quote suggests a connection between type-identity theories and\nmodels of theory-reduction: It suggests that reduction, understood as\nan inter-theory relation, is closely related to type-identity theory.\nThe idea seems to be this: Within a future psychophysiology, the fact\nthat mental types are identical to physiological types might be\nrevealed, and the nature of mental states will ultimately be given in\nterms of psychophysiology, rather then in terms of psychology. Similar\npositions have been held by Place (1954, 1956, 1960), who primarily\nspeaks of constitution rather than identity, whereas Smart explicitly\nstated this thesis in terms of identity (Smart 1959).\n3.2 Token-identity theories\n\nType-identity theory was largely, though not completely, abandoned\nwhen arguments from multiple realizability were put forward to show\nthat due to the fact that at least some mental kinds can be multiply\nrealized\u2014that is: instantiated in different physiological\nkinds\u2014an identification of mental with physiological kinds is\nimpossible. Still, this left space for token-identity theories,\naccording to which any mental kind is physically instantiated. The\nidentity is that of the objects or items that are of the two types or\nthat possess the two relevant properties, even though the types or\nproperties themselves are not identical; e.g., one and the same item\nmight have both mental and neural properties. The bearers of those\nproperties, i.e., the items falling under the types, are identical,\nbut the properties or types themselves are distinct. Token-identity\ntheory is still a reductionist position in that it opposes any form of\ninteractionist substance-dualism, substance-parallelism, and\nsubstance-epiphenomenalism. Even though it is not a very common term,\nin the literature, we sometimes find variants of the expression\n\u2018token reduction\u2019 (Cartwright 1999: 32ff.; Hooker 1981:\npart III; Bickle 1998: 223ff.).\n\nToken-identity theories perfectly match weak interpretations of theory\nreduction. If for reduction, bridge-laws that state correlations or\nmerely extensional relations are sufficient (Richardson 1979), or if\nbridge-laws are not laws in any robust sense, (Klein 2009; Dizadji\nBahmani et al. 2010) then token-identity may be sufficient for\nNagelian theory reduction.\n\nToken-identity theories also match theory-reduction according to\nSchaffner\u2019s and the New Wave reductionist\u2019s models. Within\nthese models, token-identity theories do not back up strong or\nperfectly smooth cases of reduction, but they nevertheless support\nreductions that are stronger than those that are merely extreme cases\nof replacement, not involving correction in any robust sense.\n3.3 Local reductions and disjunctive kinds\n\nAnti-reductionist arguments based on the assumption that mental kinds\nare multiply realizable have been attacked on at least two different\ngrounds.\n\nClapp (2001) and Walter (2006) argued that high-level kinds can be\nlegitimately identified with disjunctive kinds. The high-level type is\nidentical to a kind we can refer to by a term consisting of a\ndisjunction of expressions each of which refers to one of the\ndifferent low-level kinds that realize the high-level kind:\nHx = (L1x or\nL2x\nor\u2026\u2026Lnx). We may be able\nto specify the relevant term only in principle in cases where the\ndisjunction is infinitely long. This strategy is also pertinent in\nDizadji Bahmani et al. 2010.\n\nAn alternative strategy suggested by David Lewis (1969, 1972) and\ndeveloped by Jaegwon Kim argues in favor of local reductions (Kim\n1992). High-level kinds are multiply realized in virtue of the fact\nthat different physical kinds play the required role in different\norganisms, systems or contexts. Thus, if we individuate the high-level\nkinds in a more fine-grained way, we can save a weaker form of\ntype-identity theory. Even though kind K might be multiply\nrealized by kinds P1, P2, \u2026\nPn, there are more specific contexts\nC1, C2\nCn, such that in each context\nCi, only one physical kind\nPi plays the role of K in that\ncontext. Thus we make more local or contextual identifications. For\nexample, pain in general may not be identical with any one neural\nkind, but we may be able to reductively identify human-pain with one\nneural kind, lizard-pain with a second neural kind and octopus-pain\nwith a third. The relevant context could be species-specific,\nindividual-specific or even specific for conditions of occurrence\nwithin an individual.\n\nThis idea was further developed by Brian Loar (1981: ch. 4), Jackson,\nPargetter and Prior (1982), and Michael Esfeld and Christian Sachse\n(Sachse 2007; Esfeld and Sachse 2007). Esfeld and Sachse (2007) and\nSachse (2007) describe how this insight can be accommodated within the\nhigh-level science by constructing fine-grained versions of the\nhigh-level types\u2014so called \u2018functional\nsub-types\u2019\u2014which can then be linked to the relevant\nlow-level kinds, using the resources of high-level science.\n3.4 Functional reduction\n\nFunctionalism about properties of a given sort is the view that such\nproperties are functional in nature. For example: Functionalism about\nthe mental is the view that mental properties are\nfunctional. Intuitively, a functional property is a property whose\nnature, essence or significance is fully captured by a description of\nthe role it plays within a system. Versions of functionalism can be\ndistinguished with respect to the sort of role they attribute to\nfunctional properties and the sorts of resources required to specify\nthose roles. The relevant roles might be specified solely in terms of\ncausal input-output relations. Alternatively, they can be conceived of\nin terms of relationally defined computational states (computational\nfunctionalism), or in terms of goal-directed interactions\n(teleological functionalism) (cf. Block forthcoming; Lycan 1987; Van\nGulick 1980; Sober 1990).\n\n\u2018Functional reduction\u2019 signifies a family of models which\nare concerned with the reduction of such causal, computational, or\ngoal-related properties. These models describe reduction as consisting\nof a relation between a functional property P and a\nstructural or substrate property P* that plays the role\ndetermined by the functional property P, or at least does in\na restricted class of systems or contexts. This general description\nleaves the question of the exact relation between P and\nP* open, nor does it say anything about the specific\nepistemic status of functional reduction. On this issue different\nmodels of functional reduction disagree.\n\nSome functionalists assume that the functional property P and\nthe property that plays the P-role, P*, are\nidentical. On this view (also called \u2018filler-\u2019,\n\u2018realizer\u2019 or\n\u2018occupant-functionalism\u2019) a specification of the\nrelevant role\u2014typically obtained by a logical construction (the\nso called \u201cRamsey sentence\u201d) from the theory containing a\npredicate that signifies this property\u2014merely serves as a\ndescription to pick out the property that plays the functional role in\nthe actual world. That is, \u2018P\u2019 refers to the\nunderlying property that actually plays the role, namely P*.\nOthers (so called \u2018role-functionalists\u2019) assume that the\nfunctional property P is a \u201chigher order\u201d\nproperty; it is simply the property of playing the relevant role and\nis not to be identified with any given underlying property P*\nthat does so. On this view, P* merely realizes P; it\nis not identical with P. Given its denial of property identity,\nthis latter view seems less apt to a reductionist interpretation.\nHowever, there may be means by which the higher-order properties might\nbe logically constructed from lower-order ones that count as reductive\n(Putnam 1970).\n\nMoreover, there is disagreement about how we arrive at a functional\ndefinition of a property. Some tend to assume that this is a more or\nless a priori affair. Others tend to think that it is an empirical\nmatter.\n\nThus functional reduction is primarily concerned with the connection\nbetween reduction and the metaphysics of specific properties, namely,\nfunctional ones. That is: prima facie, it is compatible (if\ncompatible at all, cf. Block forthcoming) with various\ndefinitions of reduction. It can be incorporated within a Nagelian\nframework (Esfeld and Sachse 2007), and it matches New-Wave\nreductionist ideas. Occupant-functionalism can be regarded as being\ncompatible even with classical type-identity theory. Thus, models of\nfunctional reduction do not give sui-generis models of reduction;\nrather, they can be regarded as yielding detailed theories about how\nfunctional properties behave with respect to reduction. In short, the\nquestion addressed under the heading of \u2018functional\nreduction\u2019 is this: How do functional properties fit into a\nreductionist perspective?\n\nIf the following three are true: mental properties are functional in\nnature, occupant-functionalism is correct, and the role of mental\nproperties is played by physiological properties, then mental\nproperties reduce in a straightforward sense to physiological\nproperties. Alternatively, it has been suggested that even if\nidentification of the functional property with its realizer is not\nalways possible, a reduction of such properties can still be achieved,\neither by way of local reductions (Kim 1993), by way of the reduction\nto disjunctive kinds (Clapp 2001; Walter 2006), or by way of the\nreduction of functional sub-types (Esfeld and Sachse 2007).\n\nOthers have argued that functionalism best suits non-reductive\nphysicalism in the following sense: It maintains the\nnaturalist\u2019s intuition that there is unity among the underlying\nproperty-realizers which are all ultimately physical; hence, token\nidentity theory is true. Nevertheless, it opens the possibility to\naccommodate the threat of multiple realizability in a particular way:\nFunctional kinds can be multiply realized, and, hence, they can be\nregarded as being distinct from the lower-level physical properties.\nMoreover, if a pragmatic dimension is incorporated in the conception\nof functionalism, functionalism seems to contradict reductionist\ninterpretations; it may be impossible as a matter of practice to\nspecify the relevant roles using only the resources of the lower-level\ntheories (cf. Van Gulick 2010).\n\nThus, differing models of functionalism and functional reduction might\nbe used to either justify or criticize various forms of\nreductionism.\n4. Definitions of \u2018_reduces to_\u2019\n\nAs discussed above, the term \u2019reduction\u2019 can be\ninterpreted in many ways. These rival explications can be\ndistinguished (i) with respect to how they conceive of the\nrelata of the reduction relation, and (ii) with respect to\nhow they conceive of the conditions the relevant relata have\nto meet in order to instantiate the relation. Often, an epistemic\naspect complements these characterizations. This section groups the\nrival accounts with respect to the objects they offer as candidate\nrelata, and with respect to the links they offer as candidates for the\nconditions the relata have to meet in order to instantiate the\nreduction relation. Three remarks are in place: \n\nIn what follows, only candidates for the primary relata of\nthe reduction relation are listed; it is the primary relata\nwith respect to which philosophers disagree. The distinction between\nprimary and secondary relata can be explained by way\nof example: Patricia Churchland holds that\n\n\n[s]tatements that a phenomenon PR reduces to\nanother phenomenon PB are derivative upon the\nmore basic claim that the theory that characterizes the first reduces\nto the theory that characterizes the second. (Churchland 1986:\n278)\n\n\nOn this view, the relation signified by the reduction-predicate in its\nbasic, or proper use is instantiated by pairs of theories only. A\nderivative notion of reduction (and, hence, a deviant use of\nthe predicate) allows for statements of the form \u2018a\nreduces to b\u2019 to be true, even if the respective\ninstances of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 do\nnot designate theories. The truth of this statement then depends upon\na corresponding truth about theory-reduction. For example, if water\nreduces to H2O, then on this view it does so only if,\nand if so: in virtue of the fact that folk-chemistry reduces to\nchemistry.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, those who view reduction in terms\nof real world entities rather than theories would not claim that\nstatements of the form \u2018a reduces to b\u2019\nare always false when the instances of \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 designate theories, and true only when they\ndesignate properties, or parts and wholes. Rather, they would hold\nthat claims about theory-reductions are derivative upon claims about\nproperty-reductions or that the notion of theory reduction depends\nupon a notion of property reduction in a more ontological sense. Thus\nif folk-chemistry reduces to chemistry, it does so because\nwater reduces to H2O, and because Iron reduces to\nFe, and so on.\n\nSecondly, this way of conceiving of the primary relata of reduction\nsuggests that the reduction-relation is a binary relation. Recall,\nhowever, the observation that on Nagel\u2019s account, in heterogenic\ncases of reduction, no theory reduces to another theory\nsimpliciter; it does so only with respect to certain\nbridge-laws and/or boundary conditions. Depending on how one counts\nthe arity of a relation, i.e., the number of items it relates, this\nmight suggest that even on the classical interpretation, reduction is\nnot a binary relation. More recently, alternative explications have\nbeen suggested according to which reduction is of an arity higher than\n2. Thus, the intuitive notion of primary relata should be tied to the\ndesignata of the expressions flanking the reduction predicate in true\nreduction statements.\n\nFinally, talking about candidate relata, we talk about types\nof objects that possibly function as the relata of an instance of the\nreduction-relation, rather than these objects themselves.\n4.1 Representational and ontological reduction\n\nMany reductionist views seem to involve ontological claims. If one\ndenies classical substance-dualism and advocates a version of\nreductionism rather than eliminativism for minds, persons and mental\nstate, then one seems to assert that objects or\nsubstances reduce to objects. If one rejects any\ndualistic parallelism of mental and physical events and advocates a\nversion of reductionism rather than eliminativism for events such as\nperceivings, willings or pain events, then one seems to assert that\nevents may reduce to events. If one denies\nproperty-dualism, and advocates a version of reductionism regarding\nproperties such as that of being a person or of being a pain, then one\nseems to be committed to the assumption that properties\nreduce to properties. These different candidate-relata share\none important feature: They are non-representational in nature\n(ignoring cases of objects that are used as vehicles for\nrepresentations); they are real world items, not representations about\nitems in the world. Especially in the philosophy of mind, these\ncandidate relata have received special attention.\n\nIn contrast, most classical explications of reduction developed in the\nphilosophy of science treat the reduction relation to be primarily\ninstantiated by representational entities, such as theories or models.\nBuilding on these two lines of thought, one can, following Van Gulick\n(2001), draw a distinction between representational and\nnon-representational relata of the reduction relation, and accordingly\nbetween representational and ontological reduction.\nIntuitively, the conditions on an appropriate model of ontological\nreduction require the identification of a specific sort of\nintrinsic similarity between non-representational objects,\nsuch as properties or events. In contrast, the conditions on an\nappropriate model of representational reduction require the\nidentification of a specific sort of intentional similarity;\nif one representation reduces to another, it does so because of a\nsimilarity in what, and maybe how, these\nrepresentations represent.\n\nIt is noteworthy that different candidate relata come with different\ncandidate relations: Whereas those who regard properties as the\nprimary relata of reductions might coherently suggest that identity is\nthe relevant link, those who assume that theories are the primary\nrelata of reduction should refrain from this move: No theory reduces\nto itself.\n\nA brief survey of the candidate-relata should thus pair them with the\ncandidate relations that best fit each in turn (Van Gulick 2001).\n4.2 Theories\n\nThe most prominent candidates are theories. On the classical\ninterpretation, theories are sets of sentences. This suggests a\nspecific view on the reductive link: The reduction-relation is\ninstantiated when the reduced theory is syntactically derivable from\nthe reducing theory, with the help of bridge-laws. We thus get the\nfollowing definition where x is the theory being reduced,\ny is the reducing theory and z is a set of bridge\nlaws.\n\n\nTheory-Reduction I:\nx reduces to y if and only if x is a theory\n& y is a theory & \u2203z (y, z\n\u251c\nx)\n\n\nThe quantification is restricted to bridge-laws of the appropriate\nkind. A variant of this definition interprets the relata as sets of\nlaws of two theories. Nagel\u2019s homogeneous reductions\nare trivially covered (bridge-laws are irrelevant for the derivation;\nhowever, they do exist and state trivial connections not connecting\ndistinct predicates, but the very same predicate in the reduced and\nthe reducing theory). Variants of this definition include\nSchaffner\u2019s model that, in addition, mentions possible\nreplacements and catches aspects of the epistemological dimension of\nreductions, concerning the way scientists actually arrive at\nreductions (Schaffner 1993). These additional requirements might be\nregarded as imposing further constraints on the reductive link;\nhowever, especially in Schaffner\u2019s model as well as in New Wave\nmodels of reduction, these further constraints are always\ndisjunctive and seem to play the role of characterizations\nthat accompany the definition. They do not form necessary conditions\nfor reduction.\n\nDepending on how bridge-laws are characterized (epistemically,\nsemantically, metaphysically, or syntactically), a full-blown\ncharacterization of the link might or might not be a purely syntactic\naffair: If, for example, appropriate bridge-laws state\nproperty-identifications, or relations among the predicates\u2019\nextensions, then the characterization of the reductive link contains a\nmetaphysical aspect.\n\nOn a structuralist interpretation, theories are complex\nmodel-structures. Here, mapping-relations play the role derivation is\nsupposed to play on the syntactic interpretation of theories. We thus\nget (schematically, since the relevant function f is left\nunspecified):\n\n\nTheory-Reduction II:\nx reduces to y if and only if x is a theory & y\nis a theory & (f(y)=x)\n\n\nThe conditions on this function differ according to different\naccounts; however, the function is characterized solely in structural\nterms. It is supposed to capture a relevant similarity relation\nbetween the respective theories, such as a structural isomorphism\n(Suppes 1967; Sneed 1971). Moulines\u2019 criticism that this picture\nof reduction lacks an ontological link to rule out arbitrary\nreductions (Moulines 1984) reflects the idea that bridge-laws\nshouldn\u2019t be given a purely structural interpretation.\n4.3 Models\n\nThe notion of a model is also used more widely outside structuralist\ninterpretations of scientific theories. Talk of models often refers to\nfragments of theories, to mere approximations and to objects (or\ndescriptions of objects) that are used to represent a given target.\nGiven that the common interpretation of classical conceptions of\nreduction requires the relata to be fully fledged theories, it is not\nclear how sciences such as biology, psychology, and neuroscience fit\ninto the picture. In these areas, such imperfect, highly idealized or\nmerely approximately correct models dominate theorizing, and often\nmodel-descriptions are accompanied by visualizations, which might\nraise further questions as to the applicability of purely or mainly\nsyntactic notions of reduction (Bechtel & Abrahamsen 2005). There\nare no definitions of reduction that accommodate that fact directly;\nthat is, there are no definitions of how one model reduces to another\nthat might serve as a counterpart to those we have for\ntheory-to-theory reduction. Rather, definitions of reduction directed\nat model-based theorizing are often described in ontological terms: It\nis the mechanisms, or phenomena captured by the models that allegedly\nreduce. The models themselves reduce only in a derivative sense (a\ndiscussion of these and related issues is covered in the entry on\n reductionism in biology.)\n\nIf, on the other hand, structuralist reconstructions of\n\u201cimperfect\u201d theories are successful, then model-reductions\nmight be covered by Theory-Reduction II. Moreover, it has\nbeen argued that Nagel\u2019s model should not be interpreted too\nstrictly; at least, it maybe was intended to cover model-reductions as\nwell (van Riel 2011).\n4.4 Concepts\n\nReduction may also apply to concepts, where concepts are conceived of\nloosely as whatever is expressed by a meaningful term, or as the\ncognitively significance of a linguistic representation, or in Fregean\nterms as the mode of presentation under which an object is given by a\nrepresentation. Concepts can be grouped into conceptual frameworks and\nnetworks of interconnected concepts. Most notably, there seems to be a\nfundamental difference between the framework that applies to our\npsychological states from the first-person perspective, and those that\napply to our psychological states from the third-person perspective,\nsuch as the framework of neurophysiology.\n\nWhereas models and theories as candidate-relata for reduction received\nconsiderable attention in the philosophy of science, within the\nphilosophy of mind reduction as a conceptual issue also played a major\nrole.\n4.4.1 Conceptual issues and analytic functionalism\n\nOne such view is tied to functionalism, although this connection is\nmainly implicit: If a functional description of a property can be\nobtained from an analysis of a functional concept,\nthen conceptual issues play an important role in the\nepistemology of functional reduction. On one standard version\nof functionalism, it is conceptual analysis which provides the\nfunctionalist with the specification of the functional roles defining\nmental properties that are needed to carry out the reduction. The\ncondition on analytic functional reduction is thus (schematically)\nthis:\n\n\nAnalytic Functional Reduction:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if\ninstances of P2 play role R and it is a\nconceptual truth (or analytic) that whatever instantiates\nP1 plays role R.\n\n4.4.2 Conceptual issues and the explanatory gap\n\nAnother motivation for believing that conceptual issues are crucial\nfor reduction stems from the idea that the identity of properties or\nkinds expressed by two predicates P1 and\nP2 manifests in the fact that there is an a priori\nroute from P1 to P2. This\ninterpretation is implicit in the received view attacked early on by\nSmart (1959). It also plays a role in Levine 1993, 1998 and Chalmers\n1996; the idea is that for reductions to be explanatory, they must not\nleave out any aspect of the phenomenon to be explained. If\nqualia-concepts or concepts of conscious states pick out mental states\nin terms of features that cannot be fully explained in terms of the\nvocabulary of the reducing science, the explanation and hence the\nreduction is not successful. Even if our mental terms and neural terms\nrefer to the same states, if the former pick them out using mental\nconcepts that cannot be neurally explained, we will not have reduced\nthe mental to the neural. There will be a residual explanatory gap\n(Levine 1993, 1998).\n\nThus, even if two theories instantiate a relation of the sort required\nby Nagel\u2019s model, we should not speak of proper reduction, if as\na matter of epistemic possibility the connection between the domains\nof the two theories remains too loose to support the materialist\nclaims. Levine (1993) gives this an epistemological interpretation;\nChalmers (1996) seems to suggest that the epistemic possibility of two\nconcepts coming apart implies that there is a metaphysical possibility\nof the two properties coming apart. Many (e.g., Block & Stalnaker\n1999; Van Gulick 1999; Yablo 1999) have criticized this view. Even a\nhard-core physicalist will deny that the postulation of a mind-brain\nidentity as a brute fact would suffice for reduction, but at the same\ntime accept that it would suffice for the relevant sort of derivation.\nHowever, this does not support the further claim that there must be a\nconceptual path from concepts or predicates of the reducing science to\nconcepts or predicates of the reduced science. Explanations are not an\nall-or-nothing affair; there might be explanations that are more than\nmere brute-fact postulates, but still less than the tight conceptual\nconnections required by those who demand an a priori link between the\nreduced and the reducing science or conceptual framework (Van Gulick\n1992; Kim 1998).\n\nThis a priori link can, following Beckermann (2009: 162), be described\nas an a priori implication of the truth of the reduced science,\ntheory, or framework by the truth of the reducing science, theory, or\nframework:\n\n\nA Priori Reduction-1:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if the set\nof all truths about the relevant domain employing concepts of the\nP2-framework conceptually implies the set of truth\nformulated using concepts of the P1-framework.\n\n\nThis way of putting it relies on an intuitive understanding of\ndifferent conceptual frameworks. Stronger versions require there to be\na conceptual connection between pairs of properties (Jackson 2005). At\nleast under some interpretations, this apriorist view has clear\npredecents in early considerations about the unity of science.\n4.4.3 Conceptual issues and the unity of science\n\nAccording to Carnap, scientific unification should be effected by way\nof a theory that has the same expressive power as the reduced\ntheories, and, hence, by translation.\n\n\n\u2026 science is a unity, [such] that all empirical statements can\nbe expressed in a single language, all states of affairs are of one\nkind and are known by the same method. (Carnap 1934: 32)\n\n\nThe notion of translation relevant here is not particularly precise;\nhowever, as long as the notion of expressing the same thing\nis not fully captured by that of designating the same thing,\nthen reference to conceptual aspects of language obviously plays a\nrole for this view on reduction. A particularly strong version, though\napparently not Carnap\u2019s, is this (this schematic conditional is\nrestricted to properties signified by predicates, which makes the\ncondition easier to formulate):\n\n\nA Priori Reduction-2:\n The property signified by the predicate \u2018_F\u2019\nreduces to the property signified by predicate\n\u2018_G\u2019 only if it is conceptually necessary that\nwhatever is F is G, and vice versa.\n\n\nThe demand for conceptually necessary links echoes the position of\nSmart\u2019s (1959) anonymous opponent who claims that if a type\nT is identical to a type T*, then a corresponding\nconceptual relation holds between expressions signifying these\ntypes.\n4.4.4 Conceptual issues and the pragmatic dimension of reductions\n\nVan Gulick (1992, 2010) highlights another aspect of the relevance of\nconceptual considerations for models of reduction. He suggests that\nconceptual issues might play a role for reduction insofar as their\npragmatic function is concerned. People use representational devices,\nsuch as concepts, but also theories, models, and expressions, in order\nto successfully deal with objects in specific contexts. The\ndirectedness of a representation is not exhausted by the object it\nrepresents; a representation is typically embedded in a context in\nwhich it is used for a certain purpose. Here, the epistemic difference\nbetween different conceptual frameworks becomes apparent: The way the\nfirst-person perspective enables us to evaluate and deal with our\nmental states seems to be radically different from ways in which a\nthird person perspective could enable us to deal with these states. If\nsimilarity in this respect is required by an appropriate conception of\nreduction, then the prospects for reduction seem rather meager.\n4.4.5 Conceptual issues and the a posteriority requirement\n\nThe idea that reference to concepts is required by any appropriate\nexplication of the reduction-predicate is also implicit in\nNagel\u2019s work (Nagel 1961): Nagel describes bridge-laws as being\na posteriori, thereby opposing any sort of analytic\nreductionism. It has been argued that this might be crucial for fully\nunderstanding the concept of reduction. If so, then reduction turns\nout to be a four-place relation, involving not only entities but also\nthe concepts by which they are picked out or referred to. Truth\nconditions for sentences of the form \u2018a reduces to\nb\u2019, where the expressions \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 designate properties, events, phenomena or\nthe like, are sensitive not only to what \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 designate but also to how they do so, i.e.,\nto the concepts or modes of presentation \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018b\u2019 express (van Riel 2010, 2013 & 2014;\nJenkins 2011).\n4.5 Properties\n\nConsider the example of pain reducing to C-fiber stimulation. Under\none interpretation, the expressions \u2018pain\u2019 and\n\u2018C-fiber stimulation\u2019 pick out abstract objects, namely\nnatural kinds, properties or types. On this reading of \u2018pain\nreduces to C-fiber stimulation\u2019, the primary relata of reduction\nshould be conceived of as properties or types. This view has played an\nimportant role in the philosophy of mind, underlying classical\nversions of type-identity theory and being the main target of\nanti-reductionist\u2019s counter-attacks (Putnam 1967; Fodor 1974,\n1997).\n4.5.1 Property-identity\n\nWhat sort of reductive link might suit those who assume that the\nprimary relata of reduction are properties? Doing justice to the idea\nthat if some a reduces to some b, then a\ndoes not exist over and above b, one might tend to assume\nthat property-reduction requires identity:\n\n\nIdentity reduction:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if\nP1 = P2.\n\n\nThis condition is, under a certain interpretation, what underlies\nNagelian bridge-principles (van Riel 2011, see however Sarkar 2015 for\na different interpretation). It is also explicitly endorsed by Robert\nCausey (1972a, b, 1977), who connects it to theory reduction via\nmicro-reductions. Just as in the writings of Smart (1959, 1963), the\nidea is that the relevant identities are not a priori. In addition, he\nsuggests that by identifying the relevant kinds, attributes and\nproperties of the reduced theory with kinds, attributes and properties\nof the reducing theory, we arrive at explanatory reduction because the\nlaws of the respective theories will thereby be shown to be\nnomologically equivalent (Causey 1974: 5).\n\nIdentity Reduction\n is, at the same time, obviously compatible with various sorts of\na-priorism. Moreover, it has been suggested that it offers a\npossible way to escape the explanatory gap: If some mental state just\nis some physical state, then there is nothing to be explained about\nhow \u201cthese states\u201d connect; it is a sheer misunderstanding\nto ask for more than just the identity-statement. Identity claims are\nbasic in the sense that they cannot be successfully explained in the\nrelevant sense (Block & Stalnaker 1999). As is well known, it is\noften hard to decide whether or not we are faced with identity or mere\ncorrelation; Wimsatt (1976: 697ff) argues that when we conceive of\nreduction as a scientific process, we are well advised to interpret\napparent correlations as identities.\n\nRecently, van Riel (2014) has argued that the idea that reduction is\nrelevantly tied to identity generates a puzzle: Intuitively, identity\nseemingly contradicts the directionality, or what is sometimes called\n\u2018asymmetry\u2019 of reduction. More precisely: if a\nreduces to b, then b does not reduce to a.\nBut how can this be if for a to reduce to b, it is\nrequired that a=b? The suggested solution is that\n\u2018_reduces to_\u2019 generates hyper-intensional contexts, and\nthat this is best explained by the idea mentioned above: For\na to reduce to b, two conditions must be satisfied:\n(i) a=b and (ii) \u2018a\u2019 expresses\na conceptual content that relevantly differs from the conceptual\ncontent expressed by \u2018b\u2019. Another option would\nconsist in giving this a pragmatist reading as in (Van Gulick 1992,\n2010), or giving up on the idea that identity is required for\n(property-)reduction.\n4.5.2 Alternatives to property-identity\n\nThere are three rival suggestions on the market, all of which argue\nthat weaker notions of reduction still serve the purpose of the\nreductivist: The reductive link could be spelled out in terms of\nsupervenience (Kim 1982, 1990), causation (En\u00e7 1976) and\nrealization (Kim 1998; Melnyk 2003; Shoemaker 2007. Whereas usual\nstipulations of supervenience do not rule out the possibility that\na supervenes on b and, at the same time, b\nsupervenes on a, at least causation seems to be relevantly\ndirectional and so do justice to the directionality of reduction.\nNevertheless, causation is probably not what is required: the\noccurrence of water is not caused by the occurrence of\nH2O (in the usual meaning of the term\n\u2018causation\u2019); there is no temporal component involved,\nwhat is, on most accounts, required by causation.\n4.5.3 Supervenience\n\nSupervenience does not fare better, though for different reasons: It\nseems to be too weak a notion to capture the idea that guided\nreduction-talk, although it surely is a necessary condition for\nreduction. In a sense, if mental states merely supervene on\nphysiological states, they exist in a straightforward sense over and\nabove the latter. Such supervenient states are dependent; but being\ndependent is not enough for reduction (Kim 1998). Note that this is,\nup to a certain point, a matter of stipulation. However, the\nstipulation is driven by an intuition: An appropriate definition of\nthe reduction-predicate should adequately mimic the intuitions that\nguided the use of the term. If, for example, one hope was to formulate\na strictly monist position, then relying on supervenience does not\nserve this goal: Supervenience makes room for a weak form of dualism.\nFor example, it is compatible with emergent property dualism. The\nemergent properties on such a view are something over and above the\nphysical, but in so far they emerge from the physical base according\nto natural laws of emergence, they would supervene on that base. Any\ntwo cases in which the physical bases were the same would also agree\nin their emergent properties. Thus supervenience is generally not\njudged sufficient for reduction. However, many regard it as consistent\nwith reduction or even required. With regard to the mind body case,\nfor example, Kim argues that supervenience is needed for what he calls\n\u201cminimal physicalism\u201d, whether reductive or not. Under a\nsomewhat liberal though well established interpretation of Nagelian\nreduction, there is a sense in which reduction is compatible even with\nemergence, that is: a theory about \u201cnovel behavior\u201d (and,\nthus, emergent behavior) can be deduced from another theory\n(Butterfield 2011a&b).\n4.5.4 Realization\n\nRealization, which has figured prominently in recent versions of\nnon-reductive physicalism may seem too weak a relation to support a\nreduction claim, but nonetheless strong enough to guarantee\nontological unity on the token level that underlies physicalism.\nRealization can be described in terms of dependence; e.g., for a\nparticular physiological event-type to realize pain is for it to be\nsuch that in virtue of its physiological organization, its instances\nplay the pain-role. This obviously suits the (role-) functionalist\ninterpretation of higher-level properties; these higher-level\nproperties are realized by lower level ones in the sense that\ninstances of the latter play the role of the former in virtue of their\nphysical organization.\n\nMost functionalists, being opposed to type-identity theory, regard the\nrealization-relation as too weak a relation for reduction. Given a\nstrong interpretation of what reductionism consists in\u2014e.g., the\ntype-identity of properties \u2013 the realization-interpretation\nmight not suffice to guarantee reduction. It might ensure reductionism\nat the token-level, but it might, at the same time, be committed to\ndualism at the property level\u2014though perhaps only a relatively\ninnocent form of dualism. Options to reconcile role-functionalism with\nreductionism have been introduced in\n Section 3.4.\n\n4.6 Wholes and their parts\n\nThe idea that reduction is tied to part-whole relations is frequently\nalluded to in the literature (esp. Schaffner 1993; Place 1956, 1960).\nThe most elaborate version of this assumption forms part of\nCausey\u2019s more general picture of scientific unification.\nIntuitively, and abstracting away from numerous details of his\nelaborate model (described in terms of theory-reduction), a\nmicro-reduction in Causey\u2019s sense relies on an identification of\na property P1 with a property\nP2, where the syntactical arrangement of the terms\nforming the complex term \u2018P2\u2019 reflect\nthe mereological composition of P1, whereas\n\u2018P1\u2019 does not.\n\u2018P1\u2019 simply refers to the whole\nwithout explicitly referring to its parts as\n\u2018P2\u2019 does, but they in fact refer to\nthe same complex. Whereas mereological relations alone are compatible\nwith emergentist or dualist interpretations combining mereological\ncomposition and identity seems to ensure a link strong enough to count\nas a reductive link.\n\nAnother way of connecting reduction to composition is this: one could\ntry to describe reduction as a one-many relation. In one use of the\nterm \u2018composes\u2019, a given object a may be composed\nout of several objects b1, b2,\nb3 \u2026 bn. At\nleast at the face of it, there is nothing in the use of\n\u2018reduction\u2019 that should prevent us from, say, stating that\na whole reduces to its parts.\n\nAt the same time, it is not clear how tying reduction to mereology\ncould deal with cases like this: Iron reduces Fe\n(the chemical structure kind). Both expressions, \u2018iron\u2019\nand \u2018Fe\u2019, are syntactically simple. More importantly,\n\u2018Fe\u2019 does not present us with Iron-atoms as\ncomposed wholes. Similarly, the often-used example of pain and C-fiber\nfiring does not match this idea.\n\nMoreover, this move would come at the price of building a sort of\natomistic materialism into the very notion of reduction; if we were to\ndefine reduction in mereological terms, it would be conceptually\nimpossible that parts reduce to the whole they form. However, it seems\npossible (though, in the light of science, maybe highly unlikely) that\nin some cases parts do not exist over and above the whole they form.\nSuch was the view of certain historical varieties of holistic idealism\n(see for example entry on\n F.H. Bradley),\n and some have argued it is true of quantum systems including\nentangled particles (Silberstein 1999). Thus if we were to tie the\nnotion of reduction to mereology, it would not be general enough to\ncapture the full range of possible reductionist positions.\n\nFinally, mereological relations are usually regarded as being\ninstantiated by concrete objects and the wholes they form. A\nderivative notion can be defined for properties via reference to\nmereological relations between their instances. However, it is not\nclear how this could extend to events or event-types. Thus\ninterpreting reduction as a matter of mereology might prevent us from\napplying it to events and deprive us of a fully general notion of\nreduction.\n4.7 Mechanisms\n\nOne solution to this problem would be to connect reductive explanation\nto mechanistic explanation, even though mechanistic explanation is\noften described by its proponents as non-reductivist in spirit\n(Kauffmann 1970; Cummins 1975, 1983, 2000; Bechtel & Richardson\n1993; Bechtel 1994; Glennan 1996; Machamer et al. 2000; Craver 2005,\n2007).\n\nThe proposal would be to define a phenomenon a as reductively\nexplained by a phenomenon b iff a is\nmechanistically explained by b. Mechanistic dependence might\nbe distinguished from a mereological relation, if mechanisms are not\nthe sorts of things that have parts in the ordinary sense of the term\nas some have claimed (Craver 2005). On one reading, the entity\nexplained in a mechanistic explanation is an event. A mechanistic\nexplanation explains an event in terms of events that together form\nthe event to be explained. On this view, mechanistic dependence is\nanalogous to mereological dependence but not the same, and might thus\ncomplement the mereological approach to yield a fully-fledged\ncharacterization of reduction.\n5. Unresolved issues\n\nThe mainstream in the philosophy of mind is, apparently, one version\nor another of non-reductive physicalism. The majority within the\nphilosophy of science has nowadays abandoned the unificationist\nprogram, to which reduction was intimately connected right from the\nstart. However, as became apparent only in recent years, some\nquestions regarding the concept of reduction have not successfully\nbeen accounted for yet, and recent developments in metaphysics in\nconnection with metaphysical grounding may shed new light on the\nconcept of reduction.\n5.1 Reduction and explanation\n\nPhilosophers do not agree upon the relation between reduction and\nexplanation. Some argue that the concept of reduction is on a par with\nconcepts such as causation in that it is intimately tied to certain\n\u2018because\u2019, \u2018in virtue of\u2019 or \u2018by\u2019\nstatements, or that there is no fundamental split between explanatory\nand ontological models of reduction (van Riel 2011; McCauley 1981).\nOthers have held that not only is there a difference between\nexplanatory reduction, which is an epistemological matter, and\nontological reductionism, but that there might even be a difference\nbetween explanatory reduction and derivation-based models of theory\nreduction (see the entry on\n reductionism in biology;\n see also Klein 2009; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010).\n\nFor notions of reduction that are connected to explanation, the\ndifferent options are, apparently, these:\n\nThe notion of reduction is itself an explanatory concept,\nin the sense that it is a concept which is to be cashed out in terms\nof explanatory concepts: stating that a reduces to\nb, one states that b is explanatorily tied\nto a.\n The reduction relation is an explanatory relation,\ndespite the fact that the concept is not to be cashed out using\nexplanatory notions: that a reduces to b merely\nimplies that b is explanatorily tied to a.\n\n\nIf the concept of reduction is an explanatory concept, then a\ndefinition of it is either of the form [\u2026 because\n\u2026], or it relevantly involves an analysis of explanatory\nnotions. If it is not, but still is such that the relation is\nexplanatory, then a definition would at least imply the truth of a\ncorresponding explanation.\n\nGiven this broad outline, it seems reasonable to assume that most\nmodels of reduction are concerned with explanation in one of these\nsenses. Possible exceptions would include models that highlight\nreplacement issues, where an apparent phenomenon is not explained but\nrather \u201cexplained away\u201d, and perhaps some more technical\nnotions of reduction that are guided neither by intuitions of the\n\u201cnothing over and above\u201d sort, nor by any metaphysical\npositions such as functionalism (e.g., Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010;\nBickle 2008; Butterfield 2011a&b).\n5.2 Epistemological and ontological issues\n\nIn a similar spirit, notions of reduction are often characterized as\nbeing either ontological or epistemological. There\nis, again, no uniform use of these qualifications. For Oppenheim and\nPutnam (1958), epistemological reduction is a reduction that is\n\u201ctrue in virtue of the meanings of the terms involved\u201d\n(1958: 3), i.e., reduction that is tied to analysis in the spirit of\n A Priori Reduction-2;\n this use, however, is relatively rare. First of all, it will prove\nuseful to draw a distinction between epistemological and ontological\nforms of reductionism.\n5.2.1 Epistemological and ontological reductionism (and non-reductive physicalism)\n\nAn epistemological reductionist concerning a science or theory\nS holds that in fact, we are (or at some point will be) able\nto reduce S to a more fundamental science. It is a thesis\nabout what we can epistemically achieve. The ontological reductionist\nis, in this respect, more modest: She just holds that in fact, there\nis just one sort of objects and properties out there in the world;\nhowever, due to our cognitive limitations, we might never be able to\nactually carry out all the reductions that would be appropriate given\nthe actual ontological structure of our world (Scerri & McIntyre\n1997; Esfeld & Sachse 2010).\n\nThis distinction motivates different versions of non-reductive\nphysicalism. On one interpretation, the non-reductive physicalist\nopposes the idea that we can and should in fact reduce high-level\nsciences; we need them for epistemic or pragmatic purposes (Fodor\n1974, 1997; Putnam 1978; Van Gulick 1992). We need a plurality of\nautonomous theories and frameworks. However, the non-reductive\nphysicalist accepts that what is actually out there might very well be\nall of one kind, at least in some ultimate sense such that ontological\nreductionism is true.\n\nThis version of non-reductive physicalism has to be distinguished from\nan ontological version, which is best described as\ntoken-physicalism, or token-token identity theory.\nToken-physicalism is the view that what occurs in our world is just\nphysical; however, mental types are not identical to physical types.\nHence, in this form, non-reductive physicalism is compatible with a\nweak form of ontological pluralism at least of properties or\nkinds.\n\nIt is noteworthy that it is often rather difficult to draw the line\nbetween these two versions of non-reductive physicalism. This is\nmainly due to the fact that the notion of a type or a\nnatural kind is far from clear. Hempel, for example,\ntentatively suggests that what makes a type/kind a mental type/kind is\nthat it is referred to within psychology or psychological theories\n(Hempel 1969); thus the nature of a kind or type becomes dependent\nupon the context in which we refer to it, which in turn might be\nepistemically or pragmatically constrained. Fodor suggests that being\na kind is to be mentioned in a law; and that the locution \u2018it is\na law that\u2026\u2019 generates intensional contexts, i.e.,\ncontexts that are sensitive to how things are referred (Fodor 1974:\n109). Hence, being a kind again might not be an all-or-nothing affair.\nIf to be a kind is to play a certain epistemological role (this is, to\nbe sure, not Fodor\u2019s official point), then the distinction\nbetween ontological and epistemic versions of non-reductive\nphysicalism (and, analogously, between ontological and epistemological\nreductionism) might be hard to spell out.\n5.2.2 Epistemological and ontological reduction\n\nIndependent of issues regarding epistemic and ontological\nreductionism, philosophers sometimes allude to a distinction\nbetween epistemic and ontological forms of reduction. Sarkar\n(1992) suggests that a notion of reduction is epistemic if and only if\nit cashes out reduction in terms of explanation, presumably\nbased on the assumption that the concept of explanation is an\nepistemic concept. Thus insofar it enters the concept of reduction,\nthe latter is epistemic as well. On this view, an ontological concept\nof reduction would be one that is defined solely in non-epistemic\nterms.\n\nSilberstein (2002), Sarkar (1992), Brigandt and Love (2012), and\nHoyningen-Huene (1989) suggest another use of \u2018epistemic\nreduction\u2019: Reduction is epistemic if and only if its primary\nrelata are representational in nature (and, hence, this use is\nequivalent to Van Gulick\u2019s use of \u2018representational\nreduction\u2019 in 2001). Again this use seems motivated by the idea\nthat epistemic concepts enter this characterization of reduction; for\nexample, one might regard the very notion of a theory as an epistemic\nnotion insofar as a theory is a body of knowledge. Accordingly,\nontological reduction can be distinguished again in terms of the\nrelevant\nrelata: they must be non-representational entities.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this way of putting things is contentious and\npossibly misleading; after all, on a technical understanding theories\nare sets of sentences. The notion of a theory is thus a\n\u201clinguistic\u201d, rather than an epistemic notion. Labeling\ntheory-reduction as \u2018representational\u2019 rather than\n\u2018epistemic\u2019 leaves open the possibility that the concept\nof theory-reduction is independent of concepts such as knowledge,\nbelief, justification or understanding. At least Nagel\u2019s\nofficial definition does not make use of epistemic concepts.\n\nMoreover, this use of \u2018epistemic reduction\u2019 suggests a\nmisleading distinction. Any description of bridge-laws that involves\nreference to the predicates\u2019 extensions or intensions involves\nan \u201contological\u201d aspect. In this sense, the classical\naccounts of \u201cepistemological\u201d reduction are ontological,\nor at least include an ontological element.\n5.3 Reduction and Ground\n\nRecently, explanatory connectives, such as \u2018because\u2019 and\n\u2018in virtue of\u2019 have attracted considerable attention in\nthe study of metaphysical ground. Very briefly, the term\n\u2018ground\u2019 is used to articulate dependence claims, without\ncommitment to specific modal or counterfactual interpretations of\nvarious sorts of metaphysical dependence. Let us first provide some\nbackground and then hint at possible connections between reduction and\nground.\n5.3.1 A very short introduction to ground\n\nFollowing Schaffer (2009), one can draw a distinction between two\ntypes of metaphysics in terms of their alleged subject matter.\nQuinean metaphysics deals with existence questions. It asks:\nWhat exists? What is part of the ontology of a given theory, such as\nphysics? In contrast, (Neo-)Aristotelian metaphysics is\npermissive regarding existence. It is mainly concerned to identify\nwhat is fundamental and what depends on the fundamental. In\nSchaffer\u2019s terms, it is concerned with \u201cwhat grounds\nwhat\u201d (Schaffer 2009). Examples of dependence claims the\nNeo-Aristotelian is concerned with include:\n\nThe particularized property depends in its bearer.\nThe mental depends on the physical.\nAesthetic properties depend on physical properties and\nattitudes.\nMechanisms depend on their constituents and these\nconstituents\u2019 interactions. \nThe whole depends on its parts. \nSets depend on their elements.\nThe hole in the Swiss cheese depends on the cheese. \n\n\nAt least some of these claims, or cognates thereof, have formed part\nof metaphysics carried out in the Quinean spirit. Until recently,\nhowever, metaphysics did not provide the means to address these claims\nproperly, says the defender of ground. Consider the claim that the\nmental depends on the physical. Until recently,\nmetaphysicians would have suggested that this claim is to be cashed\nout in modal or counterfactual terms. The claim could be given an\ninterpretation in terms of supervenience: Any shift in mental\nproperties necessitates a shift at the level of physical properties.\n\n\nAny analysis along these lines will leave the grounding theorist\ndissatisfied. One reson to be skeptical about an analysis of\ndependence in terms of supervenience is that supervenience is neither\nirreflexive nor asymmetric (unless by way of\nstipulation). In contrast, the sort of dependence grounding theorists\nare after when claiming that the mental depends on the physical\nrequires that the physical does not depend on the mental, neither in\nwhole nor in part. Unlike supervenience, dependence, at least of the\nsort assumed in the grounding literature, is asymmetric and\nirreflexive. And dependence claims may concern necessarily\n(co-)existing entities; dependence, unlike supervenience, appears to\ngenerate hyper-intensional contexts, i.e. contexts in which even\nsubstitution of necessary equivalents is not guarantee to preserve\ntruth value (for further discussion, see Schaffer 2009, 364). \n\nThe concept of ground is supposed to do the trick. Ground is\nregarded as a primitive (Fine 2001). As a consequence, instead of\ngiving an analysis of the concept of ground, philosophers have studied\nthe structural features of ground \u2013 it is transitive,\nirreflexive, asymmetric, and it generates hyper-intensional contexts\n(Fine 2012; see also the contributions in Correia and Schnieder 2012).\nBut if this notion is primitive, how do we get access to it? After\nall, \u2018ground\u2019 is, like \u2018reduction\u2019, a\nphilosophical term; reflection on ordinary usage will not give access\nto its meaning in philosophical contexts.\n\nOne influential idea is that explanatory connectives such as\n\u2018because\u2019 or \u2018in virtue of\u2019 introduce a basic\nnotion of ground (Fine 2012). \u2018Because\u2019 and \u2018in\nvirtue of\u2019 are arguably asymmetric and irreflexive, and they\ngenerate hyper-intensional contexts (Schnieder 2011). They are part of\nordinary discourse, and we are competent in using these expressions.\nWhen taken in a non-causal sense, or in a context where these\nconnectives do not track causal dependencies, they may give access to\nthe sort of metaphysical dependence philosophers have sought to\ncapture for decades, if not centuries. \n\nAlternatively, one could give an ostensive definition and introduce\nthe notion of ground by way of examples; reflection on lists of\ndependence claims, or pairs of objects that are supposed to\ninstantiate the grounding relation, may give access to the notion of\nground (Schaffer 2009). \n\nThere are different interpretations of ground \u2013 in particular\nwith respect to what can bel labeled \u2018relational\u2019\ngrounding and \u2018operational\u2019 grounding (Tahko 2013).\nMoreover, philosophers who accept a relational interpretation disagree\nabout the primary relata of ground (candidates include:\nfacts, propositions, properties etc). \n\nSumming up: The primitive notion of ground is supposed to do justice\nto dependence claims, without any aspiration to further reduce this\nconcept to modal or counterfactual concepts; and it has been suggested\nthat explanatory connectives express this notion of ground. These\npreliminary remarks in mind, let us now turn to possible connections\nbetween redutcion and ground. First, there are two very general\nreasons to regard reduction as a particular variant of ground (5.3.2).\nAt the same time, there appears to be a tension between reduction and\nground. Either, reduction turns out to be distinct from ground, or the\nstructural features of reduction may shed light on the nature of\nground (5.2.3). Third, one may want to resist an assimilation of\nreduction to ground, based on a general skepticism towards the\nphilosophical significance of grounding talk (5.2.4). \n5.3.2 Reduction and ground linked\n\nThere are two paths leading from reduction to ground. First, reductive\ninterpretations of paradigmatic dependence claims may inspire a\nreconstruction of reduction in terms of ground. Reductionists about\nthe mental argue that mental states, like pain, reduce to certain\nphysiological states and are, hence, identical to the latter.\nEliminativists argue that mental states or properties just do not\nexist. Anti-reductionists maintain that pains exist and are different\nfrom corresponding physiological states. Some naturalists employ\nvarious notions of dependence to capture the priority of the natural\nwhile acknowledging a plurality of layers of reality. The debate thus\ncentered on questions of existence and, often, various\ndependence relations, ranging from emergence to ruthless\nreduction. It appears, then, that the reductionist about the mental\nmaintains that the mental reductively depends on the\nphysiological. \n\nBy these lights, it may seem plausible to reconstruct reduction claims\nin terms of ground (if we accept that grounding talk is fruitful).\nAbove, we have noted that the primitive concept of ground may be\nintroduced by way of examples, or by lists of paradigmatic dependence\nclaims. Theories of reduction may offer a viable interpretation of at\nleast some of these dependence claims. Hence, it should not come as a\nsurprise that some maintain that redution is sufficient for ground, so\nthat if a reduces to b, then b grounds\na (Rosen 2010, 124f., Schaffer 2009, 378, van Riel 2014). In\na similar spirit, one may suggest that grounding talk offers a\nfruitful reconstruction of the idea that some things do not exist\nover and above other things, an idea frequently invoked in the\nreductio debate (cf. Wilson 2014 for an extensive discussion). It\nseems that on this conception, reduction turns out to be a particular\nvariant of grund, perhaps among others.\n Second, conceptions of reduction in the philosophy of science,\nwhich draw on explanatory notions, are committed to the assumption\nthat there is a tight connection between reduction and ground,\nconditional on the assumption that explanatory vocabulary (interpreted\nnon-causally) does in fact introduce a notion of ground, as some\ngrounding theorists would have it. A concept of ground is often\nintroduced by reference to explanatory connectives, such as\n\u2018because\u2019, and \u2018in virtue of\u2019. On this\ninterpretation, there is a close link to conceptions of reduction in\nthe philosophy of science. Within this strand of the reduction debate,\nreduction has been conceived of as an explanatory connection (see\nabove). Of course, a robust metaphysical interpretation of explanatory\nlinks in terms of ground stands in stark contrast to some standard\nconceptions of explanation within the philosophy of science.  Realists\nhave mainly focused on causal explanation (Salmon 1989); only\nrecently, philosophers of science have turned to non-causal,\nmechanistic dependence (cf. Machamer et al. 2000, Craver 2005,\n2007). Others have taken explanation to be primarily an epistemic or\npragmatic affair (Kitcher 1989, Achinstein 1983, van Fraassen\n1980). Nevertheless, it is worth noting that it is an open question\nwhether (non-causal) explanation can be construed pragmatically or\nepistemically, or whether it requires a metaphysically robust\ninterpretation. If it turns out that explanation does require a\nmetaphysically robust interpretation, the fact that reduction has been\nconstrued as an explanatory notion in the philosophy of science may be\nseen as an indicator that claims of reduction are, properly construed,\nclaims of ground.\n5.3.3 A possible problem\n\nYet, there is a problem. Above, it has been pointed out that claims of\nreduction are often taken to imply corresponding identity claims.\nRecall Identity Reduction (4.5.1): \n\n\nIdentity reduction:\nP1 reduces to P2 only if\nP1 = P2.\n\n\nAs a consequence, reduction is taken to have the \u201cstructural\nfeatures of identity\u201d, such as reflexivity and symmetry, as\nTrogdon maintains (Trogdon 2013, similarly: Audi 2012), but also\nintensionality. Then, it is not clear how reduction could possibly\nexhibit the structural features of ground \u2013 irreflexivity,\nasymmetry, and hyper-intensionality. (This observation seems to\nparallel the tension between supervenience and dependence noted\nabove.) Philosophers have reacted in different ways. Some take these\nobservations at face value and conclude that reduction is distinct\nfrom ground (Audi 2012, Trogdon 2013). Others have argued that it\nwould be short-sighted to construe reduction in this way. From\nIdentity Reduction, it simply does not follow that reduction\nhas the structural features of identity. Recall the puzzle of\nreduction discussed above: Although reduction requires identity,\nidentity is not sufficient for reduction. In fact, if a\nreduces to b, it follows, by the asymmetry of reduction, that\nb does not reduce to a. For this and similary\nreasons, it has been suggested that reduction generates\nhyper-intensional contexts, and that reduction statements are\nsensitive to the modes of presentation expressed by the terms flanking\nthe reduction predicate (Jenkins 2011, van Riel 2013, 2014). On this\nview, reduction may turn out to be a variant of ground.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this debate turns on fundamental questions\nregarding the nature of ground. If reduction is a variant of ground,\nand if \u2018reduces to\u2019 generates hyper-intensional contexts\nin the way just sketched, then ground does not link\nnon-representational objects only. Put differently, the grounding\nstructure of the world would then depend, at least in part, on\nfeatures of representations of the world. Fine (2001, 2012)\nand DasGupta (2014) take ground to be concerned with truths or finely\nindividuated facts, rather than properties or fundamental or composed\nobjects. On the other hand, this observation has led some philosophers\nto assume that reduction, ontologically construed, should not be\nregarded as a version of metaphysical ground (Audi 2012). \n5.3.4 Reduction without grounding\n\nOf course, there may be very general reasons to reject grounding talk\naltogether (see the discussion in the entry Metaphysical Grounding).\nIn the present context, one criticism deserves close attention. Wilson\n(2014) maintains that reference to a primitive metaphysical relation\nin articulations of various dependence claims does not constitute\nphilosophical progress. Many of the various detailed explications of\ndifferent types of dependence, including mereological dependence,\nsupervenience, and the relation between determinables and\ndeterminates, promise illumination, whereas grounding talk is\nultimately obscure, mainly for two reasons. First,\n\u2018ground\u2019 is supposed to be primitive. Second, its\nstructural features of a partial order \u2013 ground is irreflexive,\nasymmetric and transitive \u2013 are too permissive and too narrow at\nthe same time, to single out a particular relation of metaphysical\ndependence, says Wilson. It is too permissive because temporal order\nand causation may have the same structural features (Wilson 2014,\n569). It may be too narrow because, for instance, mixed cases of\ndependence may violate transitivity (Schaffer 2012, Wilson 2014). So,\neven if there is prima facie evidence that reduction and ground are\nclosely linked, it is an open question whether shifting attention from\ntheories of reduction to the metaphysics of ground will prove\nfruitful. \n5.4 Problems for reductionism and the relevance of the notion of reduction\n\nScientific reduction became an important topic in the philosophy of\nscience within the context of a general interest in the unity of\nscience, and it was inspired by specific alleged cases of successful\nreductions. The most prominent argument against reductionism stems\nfrom the observation that straightforward reductions hardly ever\noccur. Hence, reductionism cannot be regarded as yielding a coherent\npicture of what actually goes on in science. As long as reductionism\nis supposed to be more than a purely metaphysical position and is\nintended to say something significant about scientific change or\nnorms, the value and relevance of the notion of reduction seems to\ndepend in part upon how well the reductionist positions fit the facts,\nwhich their critics argue they do not (see, for example, Sarkar 1992;\nScerri & McIntyre 1997).\n\nProponents of reduction have responded in different ways. Some have\nsuggested more flexible and liberal interpretations of reduction\n(Wimsatt 1976; Schaffner 1993; Dizadji-Bahmani et al. 2010), to ensure\nthat the term \u2018reduction\u2019 still serves a purpose in\ndescribing actual scientific practice. A case in point is\nSchaffner\u2019s suggestion (Schaffner 2006&2012) that we should\nreconsider the relevance of merely partial reductions or of scientific\nexplanations, broadly construed, that are reductionist in spirit,\ndespite the fact that they do not comply with more traditional\nstandards of full-fledged theory-reductions (see also Winther\n2009).\n\nOthers have opted for a more radical stance: Bickle has recently\nsuggested that philosophical theorizing about reduction should best be\nconstrued as reconstructing whatever cases scientists judge to be\nreductions (Bickle 2008).\n\nA much more modest position consists in the idea that, though\nstraightforward reductions might be rare, reductionism might play a\nrole as a regulative ideal (Schaffner 1993); the notion of reduction\ncan, on this view, be used to characterize one extreme of a spectrum\nof possible relations between different stages of scientific\ndevelopments. It comes with a specific normative power: If a reduction\ncan be effected, it should be effected.\n\nIn addition, the notion of reduction obviously plays an important role\nin the characterization of non-reductive physicalism; a careful\ninvestigation of what reductionism consists in is required to\nadequately determine in what respects, if any, a theory of mind could\nbe coherently both non-reductivist and materialist about the\nmental.\n\nFinally, the concept obviously plays an important role in the field of\nmetaphysics which often extends far into the realm of possibilities.\nEven if reductionism should fail to apply to our world and our\nscientific history, it might be of interest to consider what reality\nwould be like in other worlds where reductionism does hold, worlds\nsimilar to ours in containing many different theories or conceptual\nframeworks but ones tied together by reductive links.\n\nThe hope that the actual progress of science can be successfully\ndescribed in terms of reduction has vanished. Concepts of reduction,\nexcept for those re-adapted to actual scientific practice, are\nnowadays studied primarily in the more theoretically oriented parts of\nthe metaphysics of science.\n\nStill, the question of what the concept of reduction amounts to can be\nsatisfactorily answered even if no theory actually reduces to any\nother theory and no property reduces to any other property. Answering\nthis question may serve two closely related purposes. First, a precise\ncharacterization of what reduction is supposed to consist in will help\njudging whether or not a given theory, such as folk psychology, or a\ngiven property, such as being in pain, actually reduce to their neural\ncounterparts. Secondly, an appropriate definition of reduction is\ncalled for when it comes to evaluating anti-reductionist\npositions.\n\nAs we have seen, reduction has been conceived of as a relation that\nprimarily holds between theories, properties, substances, concepts, or\nevents. It has been described as an explanatory relation that can be\ncashed out in terms of derivation, and it could be tied to mechanistic\nor ontological dependence, supervenience and identity. It has been\nargued that theory-reduction is prior to ontological reduction; and it\nhas been argued that ontological reduction is more fundamental than\ntheory reduction. Reduction has been couched in structuralist,\nempiricist and functionalist frameworks, and it has been one of the\ncore notions of theories defending one form or another of scientific\nunification. Most philosophers have abandoned this latter view. But\neven if the outlook for strong general reductionism, a form of\nreductionism that amounts to scientific as well as ontological unity\nmight be dim, exploring the question of what it takes for a property\nor theory to reduce to another property or theory will help not only\nunderstand what the search for unity consists in, a search that\ndominated large parts of the philosophy of science in the last\ncentury; it will also help judging and understanding its rivals, such\nas non-reductive physicalism, versions of dualism, or even the\nrecently defended rainforest pluralism (Wimsatt 1994). If we know the\nconditions imposed by the reduction relation on pairs of theories or\nproperties, we will also know what these anti-reductionist theories\nare bound to deny.",
