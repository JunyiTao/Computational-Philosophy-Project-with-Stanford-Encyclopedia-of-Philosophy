Randomized Controlled Trials and Evidence-Based Medicine\n\n\u201cEvidence-based medicine\u201d (EBM) describes a movement that\nwas started (under that name) in the early 1990s by a group of\nepidemiologists at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, as a\nreaction against what was perceived as an over-reliance on clinical\njudgment and experience in making treatment decisions for patients.\nAccording to a widely cited definition: \n\n\nEvidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious\nuse of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of\nindividual patients. (Sackett et al. 1996: 312) \n\n\nSuch a definition has bite only when the concept of evidence used is\nrelatively narrow. In particular, it should not allow clinical\njudgment and experience to count as \u201cbest evidence\u201d.\n\nTo this effect, proponents of EBM have developed so-called\n\u201chierarchies of evidence\u201d that categorize different\nresearch methods with respect to their supposed quality. While there\nis no universally accepted hierarchy, the different proposed\nhierarchies all agree in the priority they give to randomized\ncontrolled trials (RCTs) and reviews thereof. A typical hierarchy\nlooks as follows (Weightman et al. 2005):\n\n\nLevel of evidence\nType of evidence\n\n\n1++\n\nHigh quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs (including\ncluster RCTs), or RCTs with a very low risk of bias\n\n\n1+\n\nWell conducted meta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with\na low risk of bias \n\n1\u2013*\n\nMeta-analyses, systematic reviews of RCTs, or RCTs with a high risk of\nbias \n\n2++\n\nHigh quality systematic reviews of, or individual high quality\nnon-randomised intervention studies (controlled non-randomised trial,\ncontrolled before-and-after, interrupted time series), comparative\ncohort and correlation studies with a very low risk of confounding,\nbias or chance \n\n2+\n\nWell conducted, non-randomised intervention studies (controlled\nnon-randomised trial, controlled before-and-after, interrupted time\nseries), comparative cohort and correlation studies with a low risk of\nconfounding, bias or chance \n\n2\u2013*\n\nNon-randomised intervention studies (controlled non-randomised trial,\ncontrolled before-and-after, interrupted time series), comparative\ncohort and correlation studies with a low risk of confounding, bias or\nchance \n\n3\n\nNon-Analytical studies (e.g., case reports, case series)\n\n\n4\n\nExpert opinion, formal consensus \n\n\nEvidence produced by RCTs has thus been called the \u201cgold\nstandard\u201d of evidence in EBM (e.g., by Timmermans and Berg\n2003).\n\nIn an RCT, a population of individuals who might benefit from a new\nmedical treatment are divided into a treatment group\u2014the group\nwhose members receive the new treatment\u2014and one or several\ncontrol groups\u2014groups whose members receive either an\nalternative or \u201cstandard\u201d treatment or a\nplacebo.  Individual patients are assigned to a group by means of a random process such as the flip of a coin. A placebo is an intervention that resembles the new treatment in\nall respects except that it has no known ingredients active for the\ncondition under investigation (i.e., it is some kind of \u201csugar\npill\u201d). Patients, researchers, nurses, and analysts are all\nblinded with respect to treatment status of all patients until after\nthe analysis. After a period of time, a pre-determined outcome\nvariable is observed and the values of the variable are compared\nbetween the groups. If the value of the outcome variable differs\nbetween different treatment groups at the desired level of statistical\nsignificance, the treatment is judged to be effective.\n\nProponents of EBM regard RCTs as reliable means to judge treatment\nefficacy because they can help to control for a variety of (though not\nall) biases and confounders. If, for instance, the symptoms of a\npatient or group of patients improve after an intervention, this may\nbe due to spontaneous remission rather than the treatment. An\nexperimental design that compares a treatment group with one or\nseveral control groups is therefore better able to control for this\nconfounder than a simple \u201cbefore-and-after\u201d design.\nSimilarly, a design in which the allocation to treatment and control\ngroups is done by a non-random process, it is possible that healthier\npatients end up in the treatment and less healthy patients in the\ncontrol group. If so, the measured improvement may be due to the\nhealth status of the patients rather than the intervention. Especially\nif the allocation is done by a medical researcher who has a stake in\nthe matter (for instance because she has developed the new treatment),\nallocation decisions may consciously or subconsciously be influenced\nby expectations about who will profit from the intervention and thus\ncreate unbalanced groups. Allocation by a random process helps to\ncontrol this source of bias.\n\nNo one denies that RCTs are powerful experimental designs\u2014and\nthat their power stems from the ability to control numerous sources of\nbias and confounding. However, to refer to RCTs as the \u201cgold\nstandard\u201d of evidence suggests that they are more. Specifically,\none may be led to assume that RCTs are necessary for reliable causal\ninference or that RCTs are guaranteed to deliver reliable results. A\nnumber of philosophers of medicine have in the past decade or so\nargued that these stronger claims do not hold to scrutiny.\n\nIn particular, the following claims have been criticized:\n\n The logic of statistical significance tests requires\nrandomization (Fisher 1935). Ronald Fisher invoked his famous tea\nlady thought experiment in order to make plausible that significance\ntesting works only with randomized allocation. Suppose an English lady\nclaims that she is able to tell whether tea or milk was poured into\nthe cup first and we would like to test this assertion. If she gets it\nright each time in a series of eight cups (four \u201cmilk\nfirst\u201d and four \u201ctea first\u201d cups), this result may\nbe due to her usually sharp sense of taste. But it may also be for\nindefinitely many other reasons: she may know that milk was poured\nfirst in the first four cups and correctly identified the first four\nas \u201cmilk first\u201d cups; the \u201cmilk first\u201d cups\ndiffer in color or shape from the \u201ctea first\u201d cups or have\nany other visually identifiable features; a confederate recorded which\ncups were \u201cmilk first\u201d and signals her; and so on. Fisher\nnow argues that only if the allocation of tea to cups was done at\nrandom, the probability of the lady getting all eight cups right is\ncorrectly identified as the probability of her getting it right if she\nwere to guess, having no discriminatory ability (which in this case is\n1/70). Therefore, we can judge that she really does have an unusual\ndiscriminatory ability or something very unlikely must have happened\n(i.e., an event with the probability 1/70). But this is incorrect. In\nfact, there is still an indefinite number of ways in which she got the\nresult even though she does not have a good sense of taste. If a\nconfederate signals her the correct answer, the probability of her\ngetting it right is very close to 1 independently of her\ndiscriminatory ability (Worrall 2007a). A good experiment would\nprevent this, but this has to do with other aspects of the\nexperimental design, not randomization.\n Randomization controls for all confounders, known and\nunknown (Fisher 1935; Giere 1984). Many variables affect a\npatient\u2019s probability of recovery: her gender, age,\nco-morbidities, genetic factors, compliance with the treatment regime,\npsychological factors and many more. If we want to judge that an\nobserved difference in recovery rates between treatment groups is due\nto the intervention rather than these other factors, we have to make\nsure that the probability distribution of causal factors is the same\nbetween the different groups. Randomization is supposed to ensure\nthis. However, for any finite test population size (and many RCTs do\nindeed have relatively small numbers of patients), it remains possible\nthat treatment groups are unbalanced: old patients ending up in one\ngroup, younger in the other etc. While it is the case that the larger\nthe number of patients in the RCT, the less likely it is that the\ngroups are unbalanced with respect to any given factor, if there are\nmany possible factors affecting the outcome it is actually very likely\nthat some of them are unbalanced. Thus, in practice if it is noticed\nafter randomization that the two groups are unbalanced with respect to\na variable that is thought to affect the outcome outcome, then the\ngroups are re-randomized or adjusted (Worrall 2002)\n It is possible to \u201cprove\u201d the results of an RCT\nto be correct (Cartwright 1989; cf. Worrall 2007b). Every\nscientist, at some point in his career, learns that one cannot judge\nX to be a cause of Y just because X and\nY are correlated. According to a prominent theory of\ncausation, viz. the probabilistic theory, causation is a form of\ncorrelation after all. Very roughly, the probabilistic theory holds\nthat X causes Y just in case X and\nY are correlated and all sources of confounding have been\ncontrolled (Reiss 2007). It can now be shown that under the\nprobabilistic theory and a host of other assumptions (including the\nassumption that randomization has been successful in that the\ntreatment groups are balanced with respect to prognostic factors), if\nthe treatment status variable is correlated with the outcome variable,\nthen the treatment must cause the outcome (Cartwright 2007). To give\nRCTs a special status in EBM on the basis of this reasoning would be\nto commit a logical mistake, however. The argument can only show that\nif all the assumptions behind an RCT are satisfied, the RCT\nwill give a causally correct result. It does not show that RCTs are\nthe only way to generate provably correct results. Indeed, it\ncan relatively easily be shown that observational studies that\nidentify so-called instrumental variables are similarly provably\ncorrect under a certain set of assumptions (Reiss 2005).\n\n\nA final but very important issue is that of the external validity of\nthe RCT results. Even under ideal conditions (i.e., when medical\nresearchers have very strong reasons to presume the assumptions under\nwhich an RCT works to be satisfied), the RCT can only establish that\nthe treatment is effective in the test population. Typical\ntest populations differ from the target populations (i.e., those\npopulations for whom the treatment has been developed and who will\neventually receive the treatment) in more or less systematic ways. For\nexample, many RCTs will exclude elderly patients or patients with\nco-morbidities but the treatment will be marketed to these patients.\nFor financial reasons, many RCTs are nowadays conducted in developing\ncountries whereas the treatments are mainly or exclusively marketed to\npatients in developed countries. Whereas the protocols for conducting\nan RCT are very strict and detailed, there are no good guidelines how\nto make treatment decisions when the patient at hand belongs to a\npopulation that differs from the population in which the RCT was\nconducted (e.g., Cartwright 2011).\n\nThere are in fact two problems of external validity in the application\nof RCT results. On the one hand there is the population-level problem\nof making an inference from test to target\npopulation. On the other hand, there is the problem of making an\ninference from population to individual. The RCT\nprovides evidence for a population-level claim: \u201cIn population\np (the test population) intervention X is effective\nin the treatment of condition Y\u201d.  For this claim to be\ntrue, the treatment must be on average effective, which allows the\neffectiveness to vary among the individuals in the population. Indeed,\nit is possible that the intervention is effective (and beneficial) on\naverage but ineffective or positively harmful in some individuals\n(i.e., members of some subpopulations). Proponents of EBM to some\nextent oversell their case when they write that EBM \n\n\nde-emphasizes intuition, unsystematic clinical experience, and\npathophysiologic rationale\u2026 and [instead] stresses the\nexamination of evidence from clinical research. (Evidence-Based Medicine Working Group 1992)\n\n\n\nbecause inferences from test to target population and from any\npopulation to the individual receiving the treatment are necessarily\nbased on clinical judgment.\n\nJohn Worrall argues that, at the end of the day, RCTs are a powerful\nmeans to control selection bias, but no more than that (Worrall 2002,\n2007a,b). As he uses the term, selection bias occurs when treatment\nand control group are unbalanced with respect to some prognostic\nfactors because a medical researcher has selected which patients will\nreceive which treatment. Selection bias in this sense obviously cannot\noccur in an RCT because in an RCT the allocation is made by a random\nprocess. But it is also clear that randomization is at best sufficient\nbut not necessary to achieve the result. A large number of alternative\ndesigns may be used to the same effect: allocation can be made by a\nstrict, albeit non-random protocol; allocation is made by non-experts\nwho are unrelated to the treatment development and therefore have no\nexpectations concerning outcomes; treatment and control groups are\ndeliberately matched (again by persons who have nothing at stake or\naccording to some protocol); and so on.\n\nA controversial issue is the role of mechanistic knowledge, that is,\nknowledge about the biological and physiological mechanisms\nresponsible for medical outcomes (and thus treatment efficacy) should\nplay in EBM. As mentioned above, the RCT provides evidence for\nblack-box causal claims of the form \u201cIn population p,\nintervention X is effective in the treatment of condition\nY\u201d. As we have seen, proponents of EBM also believe EBM\nto de-emphasize patho-physiologic rationale (a different term for\n\u201cmechanistic knowledge\u201d). Nevertheless, a number of\nphilosophers of medicine have pointed out that mechanistic knowledge\nis in fact important in EBM or that it should receive more attention.\nFederica Russo and Jon Williamson have, for instance, argued that\ncausal claims need both statistical evidence as well as evidence about\nthe mechanisms that connect an intervention with the outcome variable\nin order to be established (Russo and Williamson 2007). Others\ndisagree (Reiss 2012) or qualify the claim (Gillies 2011; Howick\n2011a; Illari 2011). Further, it has been pointed out that mechanistic\nknowledge plays an important role in the design and preparation of an\nRCT, as well as in the interpretation and application of RCT results\n(La Caze 2011; Solomon 2015). Especially when it comes to\nextrapolating research results from a test to another population,\nmechanistic knowledge is supposed to be vital (Steel 2008; see also\nnext section). On the other hand, knowledge about mechanisms is often\nhighly problematic and should not be relied on too heavily in\napplications (Andersen 2012).\n",
