    "main_text": "Forms of Virtue Ethics || Platonistic Virtue Ethics\n2.4 Platonistic Virtue Ethics\n\nThe fourth form a virtue ethic might adopt takes its inspiration from\nPlato. The Socrates of Plato\u2019s dialogues devotes a great deal of\ntime to asking his fellow Athenians to explain the nature of virtues\nlike justice, courage, piety, and wisdom. So it is clear that Plato\ncounts as a virtue theorist. But it is a matter of some debate whether\nhe should be read as a virtue ethicist (White 2015). What is not open\nto debate is whether Plato has had an important influence on the\ncontemporary revival of interest in virtue ethics. A number of those\nwho have contributed to the revival have done so as Plato scholars\n(e.g., Prior 1991; Kamtekar 1998; Annas 1999; and Reshotko 2006).\nHowever, often they have ended up championing a eudaimonist version of\nvirtue ethics (see Prior 2001 and Annas 2011), rather than a version\nthat would warrant a separate classification. Nevertheless, there are\ntwo variants that call for distinct treatment.\n\nTimothy Chappell takes the defining feature of Platonistic virtue\nethics to be that \u201cGood agency in the truest and fullest sense\npresupposes the contemplation of the Form of the Good\u201d (2014).\nChappell follows Iris Murdoch in arguing that \u201cIn the moral life\nthe enemy is the fat relentless ego\u201d (Murdoch 1971: 51).\nConstantly attending to our needs, our desires, our passions, and our\nthoughts skews our perspective on what the world is actually like and\nblinds us to the goods around us. Contemplating the goodness of\nsomething we encounter\u2014which is to say, carefully attending to\nit \u201cfor its own sake, in order to understand it\u201d (Chappell\n2014: 300)\u2014breaks this natural tendency by drawing our attention\naway from ourselves. Contemplating such goodness with regularity makes\nroom for new habits of thought that focus more readily and more\nhonestly on things other than the self. It alters the quality of our\nconsciousness. And \u201canything which alters consciousness in the\ndirection of unselfishness, objectivity, and realism is to be\nconnected with virtue\u201d (Murdoch 1971: 82). The virtues get\ndefined, then, in terms of qualities that help one \u201cpierce the\nveil of selfish consciousness and join the world as it really\nis\u201d (91). And good agency is defined by the possession and\nexercise of such virtues. Within Chappell\u2019s and Murdoch\u2019s\nframework, then, not all normative properties get defined in terms of\nvirtue. Goodness, in particular, is not so defined. But the kind of\ngoodness which is possible for creatures like us is defined by virtue,\nand any answer to the question of what one should do or how one should\nlive will appeal to the virtues.\n\nAnother Platonistic variant of virtue ethics is exemplified by Robert\nMerrihew Adams. Unlike Murdoch and Chappell, his starting point is not\na set of claims about our consciousness of goodness. Rather, he begins\nwith an account of the metaphysics of goodness. Like Murdoch and\nothers influenced by Platonism, Adams\u2019s account of goodness is\nbuilt around a conception of a supremely perfect good. And like\nAugustine, Adams takes that perfect good to be God. God is both the\nexemplification and the source of all goodness. Other things are good,\nhe suggests, to the extent that they resemble God (Adams 1999).\n\nThe resemblance requirement identifies a necessary condition for being\ngood, but it does not yet give us a sufficient condition. This is\nbecause there are ways in which finite creatures might resemble God\nthat would not be suitable to the type of creature they are. For\nexample, if God were all-knowing, then the belief, \u201cI am\nall-knowing,\u201d would be a suitable belief for God to have. In\nGod, such a belief\u2014because true\u2014would be part of\nGod\u2019s perfection. However, as neither you nor I are all-knowing,\nthe belief, \u201cI am all-knowing,\u201d in one of us would not be\ngood. To rule out such cases we need to introduce another factor. That\nfactor is the fitting response to goodness, which Adams suggests is\nlove. Adams uses love to weed out problematic resemblances:\n\u201cbeing excellent in the way that a finite thing can be consists\nin resembling God in a way that could serve God as a reason for loving\nthe thing\u201d (Adams 1999: 36).\n\nVirtues come into the account as one of the ways in which some things\n(namely, persons) could resemble God. \u201c[M]ost of the excellences\nthat are most important to us, and of whose value we are most\nconfident, are excellences of persons or of qualities or actions or\nworks or lives or stories of persons\u201d (1999: 42). This is one of\nthe reasons Adams offers for conceiving of the ideal of perfection as\na personal God, rather than an impersonal form of the Good. Many of\nthe excellences of persons of which we are most confident are virtues\nsuch as love, wisdom, justice, patience, and generosity. And within\nmany theistic traditions, including Adams\u2019s own Christian\ntradition, such virtues are commonly attributed to divine agents.\n\nA Platonistic account like the one Adams puts forward in Finite\nand Infinite Goods clearly does not derive all other normative\nproperties from the virtues (for a discussion of the relationship\nbetween this view and the one he puts forward in A Theory of\nVirtue (2006) see Pettigrove 2014). Goodness provides the\nnormative foundation. Virtues are not built on that foundation;\nrather, as one of the varieties of goodness of whose value we are most\nconfident, virtues form part of the foundation. Obligations, by\ncontrast, come into the account at a different level. Moral\nobligations, Adams argues, are determined by the expectations and\ndemands that \u201carise in a relationship or system of relationships\nthat is good or valuable\u201d (1999: 244). Other things being equal,\nthe more virtuous the parties to the relationship, the more binding\nthe obligation. Thus, within Adams\u2019s account, the good (which\nincludes virtue) is prior to the right. However, once good\nrelationships have given rise to obligations, those obligations take\non a life of their own. Their bindingness is not traced directly to\nconsiderations of goodness. Rather, they are determined by the\nexpectations of the parties and the demands of the relationship.\n",
