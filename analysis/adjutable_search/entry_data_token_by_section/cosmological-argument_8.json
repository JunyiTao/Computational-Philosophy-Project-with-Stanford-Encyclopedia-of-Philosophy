    "main_text": "Argument for a Non-contingent Cause || Objection 4: Problems with the Concept of a Necessary Being\n4.5 Objection 4: Problems with the Concept of a Necessary Being\n\nKant argued that the cosmological argument introduced an empirical\npremise to evade the difficulties of the ontological argument.\nAlthough in the ontological argument the perfect being is allegedly\ndetermined to exist through its own concept, in fact nothing can be\ndetermined to exist in this manner; one has to begin with existence\n(see entry on\n Ontological Arguments).\n The cosmological argument, on the other hand, proceeds from an\nempirical premise about my existence to the existence of an\nunconditioned, absolutely necessary being, a being whose nonexistence\nis \u201cimpossible\u201d, \u201cabsolutely inconceivable\u201d\n(1787: B621). This concept has the same status as geometrical\nconcepts, which though necessary do not establish the existence of\nanything corresponding to the concept. So, when we think of an\nabsolutely necessary being, are we thinking about anything at all?\nWhat this absolutely necessary being is, what properties it has, can\nbe determined not through experience but only through reason, that is,\nfrom a priori concepts alone. Since the only concept that suffices to\ndetermine its properties is that of a most real being, the concept of\nan absolutely necessary being presupposes that concept. However, that\nthe most real being necessarily exists is the burden of the\nontological argument. Hence, the CA depends on the ontological\nargument to determine the absolutely necessary being. But since the\nontological argument is defective for the above and other reasons, the\ncosmological argument that depends on or invokes it likewise must be\ndefective (1787: B634; for an alternative interpretation of\nKant\u2019s argument see Proops 2014).\n\nKant\u2019s contention that the necessity found in \u201cnecessary\nbeing\u201d is logical necessity was common up through the 1960s.\nJ.J.C. Smart wrote,\n\n\nAnd by \u201ca necessary being\u201d the cosmological argument means\n\u201ca logically necessary being\u201d, i.e., \u201ca\nbeing whose non-existence is inconceivable in the sort of way that a\ntriangle\u2019s having four sides is inconceivable\u201d.\u2026\nNow since \u201cnecessary\u201d is a word which applies primarily to\npropositions, we shall have to interpret \u201cGod is a necessary\nbeing\u201d as \u201cThe proposition \u2018God exists\u2019 is\nlogically necessary\u201d (1955: 38); in a later work, Smart (Smart\nand Haldane 1996: 41\u201347) broadened his notion of necessity.)\n\n\nMany recent discussions of the cosmological argument, both supporting\nand critiquing it, interpret the notion of a necessary being as a\nbeing that cannot not exist (O\u2019Connor 2008: 78, 2013: 38). For\nexample, Gale-Pruss contend that speaking about necessary beings does\nnot differ from speaking of the necessity of propositions (see\n section 6).\n As such, as Plantinga notes, if a necessary being is possible, it\nexists (God, Freedom and Evil, 1967: 110). It is a being that\nexists in all possible worlds. The only question that remains is\nwhether God\u2019s existence is possible. This notion is similar to,\nif not a modernization of, Aquinas\u2019s contention that God\u2019s\nessence is to exist. Aquinas attempts to avoid the accusation that\nthis invokes the ontological argument on the grounds that we do not\nhave an adequate concept of God\u2019s essence (ST\nI,q.2,a.1). However, if we understand \u201cnecessary being\u201d in\nthis sense, we can dispose of the cosmological argument as irrelevant;\nwhat is needed rather is an argument to establish that God\u2019s\nexistence understood as logically necessary is possible, for if it is\npossible that it is necessary that God exists, then necessarily God\nexists (by Axiom S5).\n\nHowever, this need not be the sense in which \u201cnecessary\nbeing\u201d is understood in the cosmological argument. A more\nadequate notion of necessary being is that the necessity is\nmetaphysical or factual (Hick 1960). A necessary being is one that if\nit exists, it neither came into existence nor can cease to exist, and\ncorrespondingly, if it does not exist, it cannot come into existence\n(Reichenbach 1972: 117\u201320). If it exists, it eternally maintains\nits own existence; it is self-sufficient and self-sustaining. So\nunderstood, the cosmological argument does not rely on notions central\nto the ontological argument. Rather, instead of being superfluous, the\ncosmological argument, if sound, gives us reason to think that the\nnecessary being exists rather than not.\n\nMackie replies that if God has mere metaphysical or factual necessity,\nGod\u2019s existence is logically contingent, such that some reason\nis required for God\u2019s own existence (Mackie 1982: 84). As\nSwinburne notes, God is a logically contingent being, and so could\nhave not-existed (2004: 79, 148). Why, then, does God exist? The PSR\ncan be applied to the necessary being.\n\nThe theist responds that the PSR does not address logical contingency\nbut metaphysical contingency. One is not required to find a reason for\nwhat is not metaphysically contingent. It is not that the necessary\nbeing is self-explanatory; rather, a demand for explaining its\nexistence is inappropriate. Hence, the theist concludes,\nHawking\u2019s question \u201cWho created God?\u201d (Hawking 1988:\n174) is out of place (Davis 1997). We will return to this discussion\nin\n section 9.\n",
