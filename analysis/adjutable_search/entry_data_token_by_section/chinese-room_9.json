    "main_text": "Replies to the Chinese Room Argument || The Other Minds Reply\n4.4 The Other Minds Reply\n\nRelated to the preceding is The Other Minds Reply: \u201cHow do you\nknow that other people understand Chinese or anything else? Only by\ntheir behavior. Now the computer can pass the behavioral tests as well\nas they can (in principle), so if you are going to attribute cognition\nto other people you must in principle also attribute it to\ncomputers.\u201d\n\nSearle\u2019s (1980) reply to this is very short:\n\nThe problem in this discussion is not about how I know that other\npeople have cognitive states, but rather what it is that I am\nattributing to them when I attribute cognitive states to them. The\nthrust of the argument is that it couldn\u2019t be just computational\nprocesses and their output because the computational processes and\ntheir output can exist without the cognitive state. It is no answer to\nthis argument to feign anesthesia. In \u2018cognitive sciences\u2019\none presupposes the reality and knowability of the mental in the same\nway that in physical sciences one has to presuppose the reality and\nknowability of physical objects.\n\n\nCritics hold that if the evidence we have that humans understand is\nthe same as the evidence we might have that a visiting\nextra-terrestrial alien understands, which is the same as the evidence\nthat a robot understands, the presuppositions we may make in the case\nof our own species are not relevant, for presuppositions are sometimes\nfalse. For similar reasons, Turing, in proposing the Turing Test, is\nspecifically worried about our presuppositions and chauvinism. If the\nreasons for the presuppositions regarding humans are pragmatic, in\nthat they enable us to predict the behavior of humans and to interact\neffectively with them, perhaps the presupposition could apply equally\nto computers (similar considerations are pressed by Dennett, in his\ndiscussions of what he calls the Intentional Stance).\n\nSearle raises the question of just what we are attributing in\nattributing understanding to other minds, saying that it is more than\ncomplex behavioral dispositions. For Searle the additional seems to be\ncertain states of consciousness, as is seen in his 2010 summary of the\nCRA conclusions. Terry Horgan (2013) endorses this claim: \u201cthe\nreal moral of Searle\u2019s Chinese room thought experiment is that\ngenuine original intentionality requires the presence of internal\nstates with intrinsic phenomenal character that is inherently\nintentional\u2026\u201d But this tying of understanding to\nphenomenal consciousness raises a host of issues. \n\nWe attribute limited understanding of language to toddlers, dogs, and\nother animals, but it is not clear that we are ipso facto attributing\nunseen states of subjective consciousness \u2013 what do we know of\nthe hidden states of exotic creatures? Ludwig Wittgenstein (the\nPrivate Language Argument) and his followers pressed similar points.\nAltered qualia possibilities, analogous to the inverted spectrum,\narise: suppose I ask \u201cwhat\u2019s the sum of 5 and 7\u201d and\nyou respond \u201cthe sum of 5 and 7 is 12\u201d, but as you heard\nmy question you had the conscious experience of hearing and\nunderstanding \u201cwhat is the sum of 10 and 14\u201d, though you\nwere in the computational states appropriate for producing the correct\nsum and so said \u201c12\u201d. Are there certain conscious states\nthat are \u201ccorrect\u201d for certain functional states?\nWittgenstein\u2019s considerations appear to be that the subjective\nstate is irrelevant, at best epiphenomenal, if a language user\ndisplays appropriate linguistic behavior. Afterall, we are taught\nlanguage on the basis of our overt responses, not our qualia. The\nmathematical savant Daniel Tammet reports that when he generates the\ndecimal expansion of pi to thousands of digits he experiences colors\nthat reveal the next digit, but even here it may be that\nTennant\u2019s performance is likely not produced by the colors he\nexperiences, but rather by unconscious neural computation. The\npossible importance of subjective states is further considered in the\nsection on Intentionality, below. \n\nIn the 30 years since the CRA there has been philosophical interest in\nzombies \u2013 creatures that look like and behave just as normal\nhumans, including linguistic behavior, yet have no subjective\nconsciousness. A difficulty for claiming that subjective states of\nconsciousness are crucial for understanding meaning will arise in\nthese cases of absent qualia: we can\u2019t tell the difference\nbetween zombies and non-zombies, and so on Searle\u2019s account we\ncan\u2019t tell the difference between those that really understand\nEnglish and those that don\u2019t. And if you and I can\u2019t tell\nthe difference between those who understand language and Zombies who\nbehave like they do but don\u2019t really, than neither can any\nselection factor in the history of human evolution \u2013 to\npredators, prey, and mates, zombies and true understanders, with the\n\u201cright\u201d conscious experience, have been indistinguishable.\nBut then there appears to be a distinction without a difference. In\nany case, Searle\u2019s short reply to the Other Minds Reply may be\ntoo short. \n\nDescartes famously argued that speech was sufficient for attributing\nminds and consciousness to others, and infamously argued that it was\nnecessary. Turing was in effect endorsing Descartes\u2019 sufficiency\ncondition, at least for intelligence, while substituting written for\noral linguistic behavior. Since most of us use dialog as a sufficient\ncondition for attributing understanding, Searle\u2019s argument,\nwhich holds that speech is a sufficient condition for attributing\nunderstanding to humans but not for anything that doesn\u2019t share\nour biology, an account would appear to be required of what\nadditionally is being attributed, and what can justify the additional\nattribution. Further, if being con-specific is key on Searle\u2019s\naccount, a natural question arises as to what circumstances would\njustify us in attributing understanding (or consciousness) to\nextra-terrestrial aliens who do not share our biology? Offending\nET\u2019s by withholding attributions of understanding until after\ndoing a post-mortem may be risky.\n\nHans Moravec, director of the Robotics laboratory at Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity, and author of Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent\nMind, argues that Searle\u2019s position merely reflects\nintuitions from traditional philosophy of mind that are out of step\nwith the new cognitive science. Moravec endorses a version of the\nOther Minds reply. It makes sense to attribute intentionality to\nmachines for the same reasons it makes sense to attribute them to\nhumans; his \u201cinterpretative position\u201d is similar to the\nviews of Daniel Dennett. Moravec goes on to note that one of the\nthings we attribute to others is the ability to make attributions of\nintentionality, and then we make such attributions to ourselves. It is\nsuch self-representation that is at the heart of consciousness. These\ncapacities appear to be implementation independent, and hence possible\nfor aliens and suitably programmed computers.\n\nAs we have seen, the reason that Searle thinks we can disregard the\nevidence in the case of robots and computers is that we know that\ntheir processing is syntactic, and this fact trumps all other\nconsiderations. Indeed, Searle believes this is the larger point that\nthe Chinese Room merely illustrates. This larger point is addressed in\nthe Syntax and Semantics section below.\n",
