    "main_text": "Some kinds of truth definition on the 1933 pattern || The truth definition by quantifier elimination\n3. The 1956 definition and its offspring\n\nIn 1933 Tarski assumed that the formal languages that he was dealing\nwith had two kinds of symbol (apart from punctuation), namely\nconstants and variables. The constants included logical constants, but\nalso any other terms of fixed meaning. The variables had no\nindependent meaning and were simply part of the apparatus of\nquantification.\n\nModel theory\n by contrast works with three levels of symbol. There are the logical\nconstants \\((=, \\neg\\), & for example), the variables (as before),\nand between these a middle group of symbols which have no fixed\nmeaning but get a meaning through being applied to a particular\nstructure. The symbols of this middle group include the nonlogical\nconstants of the language, such as relation symbols, function symbols\nand constant individual symbols. They also include the quantifier\nsymbols \\(\\forall\\) and \\(\\exists\\), since we need to refer to the\nstructure to see what set they range over. This type of three-level\nlanguage corresponds to mathematical usage; for example we write the\naddition operation of an abelian group as +, and this symbol stands\nfor different functions in different groups.\n\nSo one has to work a little to apply the 1933 definition to\nmodel-theoretic languages. There are basically two approaches: (1)\nTake one structure \\(A\\) at a time, and regard the nonlogical\nconstants as constants, interpreted in \\(A\\). (2) Regard the\nnonlogical constants as variables, and use the 1933 definition to\ndescribe when a sentence is satisfied by an assignment of the\ningredients of a structure \\(A\\) to these variables. There are\nproblems with both these approaches, as Tarski himself describes in\nseveral places. The chief problem with (1) is that in model theory we\nvery frequently want to use the same language in connection with two\nor more different structures \u2013 for example when we are defining\nelementary embeddings between structures (see the entry on\n first-order model theory).\n The problem with (2) is more abstract: it is disruptive and bad\npractice to talk of formulas with free variables being\n\u2018true\u2019. (We saw in Section 2.2 how Tarski avoided talking\nabout truth in connection with sentences that have varying\ninterpretations.) What Tarski did in practice, from the appearance of\nhis textbook in 1936 to the late 1940s, was to use a version of (2)\nand simply avoid talking about model-theoretic sentences being true in\nstructures; instead he gave an indirect definition of what it is for a\nstructure to be a \u2018model of\u2019 a sentence, and apologised\nthat strictly this was an abuse of language. (Chapter VI of Tarski\n1994 still contains relics of this old approach.)\n\nBy the late 1940s it had become clear that a direct model-theoretic\ntruth definition was needed. Tarski and colleagues experimented with\nseveral ways of casting it. The version we use today is based on that\npublished by Tarski and Robert Vaught in 1956. See the entry on\n classical logic\n for an exposition.\n\nThe right way to think of the model-theoretic definition is that we\nhave sentences whose truth value varies according to the situation\nwhere they are used. So the nonlogical constants are not variables;\nthey are definite descriptions whose reference depends on the context.\nLikewise the quantifiers have this indexical feature, that the domain\nover which they range depends on the context of use. In this spirit\none can add other kinds of indexing. For example a Kripke structure is\nan indexed family of structures, with a relation on the index set;\nthese structures and their close relatives are fundamental for the\nsemantics of modal,\n temporal\n and\n intuitionist\n logic.\n\nAlready in the 1950s model theorists were interested in formal\nlanguages that include kinds of expression different from anything in\nTarski\u2019s 1933 paper. Extending the truth definition to\ninfinitary logics was no problem at all. Nor was there any serious\nproblem about most of the generalised quantifiers proposed at the\ntime. For example there is a quantifier \\(Qxy\\) with the intended\nmeaning:\n\n\\(QxyF(x,y)\\) if and only if there is an infinite set \\(X\\) of\nelements such that for all \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) in \\(X, F(a,b)\\). \n\nThis definition itself shows at once how the required clause in the\ntruth definition should go.\n\nIn 1961 Leon Henkin pointed out two sorts of model-theoretic language\nthat didn\u2019t immediately have a truth definition of\nTarski\u2019s kind. The first had infinite strings of\nquantifiers: \n\n\\[\n\\forall v_1 \\exists v_2 \\forall v_3 \\exists v_4\\ldots R(v_1,v_2,v_3, v_4,\\ldots).\n\\]\n\n\nThe second had quantifiers that are not linearly ordered. For ease of\nwriting I use Hintikka\u2019s later notation for these:\n\n\\[\n\\forall v_1 \\exists v_2 \\forall v_3 (\\exists v_4 /\\forall v_1) R(v_1,v_2,v_3, v_4).\n\\]\n\n\nHere the slash after \\(\\exists v_4\\) means that this quantifier is\noutside the scope of the earlier quantifier \\(\\forall v_1\\) (and also\noutside that of the earlier existential quantifier).\n\nHenkin pointed out that in both cases one could give a natural\nsemantics in terms of Skolem functions. For example the second\nsentence can be paraphrased as \n\n\\[\n\\exists f\\exists g \\forall v_1 \\forall v_3 R(v_1,f(v_1),v_3,g(v_3)),\n\\]\n\n\nwhich has a straightforward Tarski truth condition in second order\nlogic. Hintikka then observed that one can read the Skolem functions\nas winning strategies in a game, as in the entry on\n logic and games.\n In this way one can build up a compositional semantics, by assigning\nto each formula a game. A sentence is true if and only if the player\nMyself (in Hintikka\u2019s nomenclature) has a winning strategy for\nthe game assigned to the sentence. This game semantics agrees with\nTarski\u2019s on conventional first-order sentences. But it is far\nfrom fully abstract; probably one should think of it as an operational\nsemantics, describing how a sentence is verified rather than whether\nit is true.\n\nThe problem of giving a Tarski-style semantics for Henkin\u2019s two\nlanguages turned out to be different in the two cases. With the first,\nthe problem is that the syntax of the language is not well-founded:\nthere is an infinite descending sequence of subformulas as one strips\noff the quantifiers one by one. Hence there is no hope of giving a\ndefinition of satisfaction by recursion on the complexity of formulas.\nThe remedy is to note that the explicit form of\nTarski\u2019s truth definition in Section 2.1 above didn\u2019t\nrequire a recursive definition; it needed only that the conditions on\nthe satisfaction relation \\(S\\) pin it down uniquely. For\nHenkin\u2019s first style of language this is still true, though the\nreason is no longer the well-foundedness of the syntax.\n\nFor Henkin\u2019s second style of language, at least in\nHintikka\u2019s notation (see the entry on\n independence friendly logic),\n the syntax is well-founded, but the displacement of the quantifier\nscopes means that the usual quantifier clauses in the definition of\nsatisfaction no longer work. To get a compositional and fully abstract\nsemantics, one has to ask not what assignments of variables satisfy a\nformula, but what sets of assignments satisfy the formula\n\u2018uniformly\u2019, where \u2018uniformly\u2019 means\n\u2018independent of assignments to certain variables, as shown by\nthe slashes on quantifiers inside the formula\u2019. (Further details\nof revisions of Tarski\u2019s truth definition along these lines are\nin the entry on\n dependence logic.)\n Henkin\u2019s second example is of more than theoretical interest,\nbecause clashes between the semantic and the syntactic scope of\nquantifiers occur very often in natural languages.\n",
