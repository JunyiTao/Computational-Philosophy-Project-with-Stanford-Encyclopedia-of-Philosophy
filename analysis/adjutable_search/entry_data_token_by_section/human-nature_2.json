Moreover, they have been taken to be\nable to fulfil this role in virtue of being necessary and\nsufficient for the organism\u2019s membership of the species,\ni.e., \u201cessential\u201d in one meaning of the term. This view of\nspecies membership, and the associated view of species themselves, has\nbeen influentially dubbed \u201ctypological thinking\u201d (Mayr\n1959 [1976: 27f.]; cf. Mayr 1982: 260) and \u201cessentialism\u201d\n(Hull 1965: 314ff.; cf. Mayr 1968 [1976: 428f.]). The former\ncharacterisation involves an epistemological focus on the\nclassificatory procedure, the latter a metaphysical focus on the\nproperties thus singled out. Ernst Mayr claimed that the\nclassificatory approach originates in Plato\u2019s theory of forms,\nand, as a result, involves the further assumption that the properties\nare unchanging. According to David Hull, its root cause is the attempt\nto fit the ontology of species taxa to an Aristotelian theory of\ndefinition.\n\nThe theory of definition developed in Aristotle\u2019s logical works\nassigns entities to a genus and distinguishes them from other members\nof the genus, i.e., from other \u201cspecies\u201d, by their\ndifferentiae (Topics 103b). The procedure is descended from\nthe \u201cmethod of division\u201d of Plato, who provides a crude\nexample as applied to humans, when he has the Eleatic Stranger in the\nStatesman characterise them as featherless bipeds (266e).\nHull and many scholars in his wake (Dupr\u00e9 2001: 102f.) have\nclaimed that this simple schema for picking out essential conditions\nfor species membership had a seriously deleterious effect on\nbiological taxonomy until Darwin (cf. Winsor 2006).\n\nHowever, there is now widespread agreement that Aristotle was no\ntaxonomic essentialist (Balme 1980: 5ff.; Mayr 1982: 150ff.; Balme\n1987: 72ff.; Ereshefsky 2001: 20f; Richards 2010: 21ff.; Wilkins 2018:\n9ff.). First, the distinction between genus and differentiae was for\nAristotle relative to the task at hand, so that a\n\u201cspecies\u201d picked out in this manner could then count as\nthe genus for further differentiation. Second, the Latin term\n\u201cspecies\u201d, a translation of the Greek eidos, was\na logical category with no privileged relationship to biological\nentities; a prime example in the Topics is the species\njustice, distinguished within the genus virtue (143a). Third, in a key\nmethodological passage, Parts of Animals, I.2\u20133\n(642b\u2013644b), Aristotle explicitly rejects the method of\n\u201cdichotomous division\u201d, which assigns entities to a genus\nand then seeks a single differentia, as inappropriate to the\nindividuation of animal kinds. Instead, he claims, a multiplicity of\ndifferentiae should be brought to bear. He emphasises this point in\nrelation to humans (644a).\n\nAccording to Pierre Pellegrin and David Balme, Aristotle did not seek\nto establish a taxonomic system in his biological works (Pellegrin\n1982 [1986: 113ff.]; Balme 1987, 72). Rather, he simply accepted the\neveryday common sense partitioning of the animal world (Pellegrin 1982\n[1986: 120]; Richards 2010: 24; but cf. Charles 2000: 343ff.). If this\nis correct, Aristotle didn\u2019t even ask after the conditions for\nbelonging to the species Homo sapiens. So he wasn\u2019t\nproposing any particular answer, and specifically not the\n\u201cessentialist\u201d answer advanced by TP5. In as far as such\nan answer has been employed in biological taxonomy (cf. Winsor 2003),\nits roots appear to lie in Neoplatonic, Catholic misinterpretations of\nAristotle (Richards 2010: 34ff.; Wilkins 2018: 22ff.). Be that as it\nmay, the fifth use of \u201chuman nature\u201d transported by\ntradition\u2014to pick out essential conditions for an\norganism\u2019s belonging to the species\u2014is of eminent\ninterest. The systematic concern behind Mayr and Hull\u2019s\nhistorical claims is that accounts of the form of TP5 are incompatible\nwith evolutionary theory. We shall look at this concern in\n section 2\n of this entry.\n\nBecause the term \u201cessentialism\u201d recurs with different\nmeanings in discussions of human nature and because some of the\ntheoretical claims thus summarised are assumed to be Aristotelian in\norigin, it is worth spending a moment here to register what claims can\nbe singled out by the expression. The first, purely\nclassificatory conception just discussed should be distinguished from\na second view that is also frequently labelled\n\u201cessentialist\u201d and which goes back to Locke\u2019s\nconcept of \u201creal essence\u201d (1689: III, iii, 15). According\nto essentialism thus understood, an essence is the intrinsic feature\nor features of an entity that fulfils or fulfil a dual role: firstly,\nof being that in virtue of which something belongs to a kind and,\nsecondly, of explaining why things of that kind typically have a\nparticular set of observable features. Thus conceived,\n\u201cessence\u201d has both a classificatory and an explanatory\nfunction and is the core of a highly influential,\n\u201cessentialist\u201d theory of natural kinds, developed in the\nwake of Kripke\u2019s and Putnam\u2019s theories of reference.\n\nAn account of human nature that is essentialist in this sense would\ntake the nature of the human natural kind to be a set of\nmicrostructural properties that have two roles: first, they constitute\nan organism\u2019s membership of the species Homo sapiens.\nSecond, they are causally responsible for the organism manifesting\nmorphological and behavioural properties typical of species members.\nParadigms of entities with such natures or essences are chemical\nelements. An example is the element with the atomic number 79, the\nmicrostructural feature that accounts for surface properties of gold\nsuch as yellowness. Applied to organisms, it seems that the relevant\nexplanatory relationship will be developmental, the microstructures\nproviding something like a blueprint for the properties of the mature\nindividual. Kripke assumed that some such blueprint is the\n\u201cinternal structure\u201d responsible for the typical\ndevelopment of tigers as striped, carnivorous quadrupeds (Kripke 1972\n[1980: 120f.]).\n\nAs the first, pseudo-Aristotelian version of essentialism illustrates,\nthe classificatory and explanatory components of what we might call\n\u201cKripkean essentialism\u201d can be taken apart. Thus,\n\u201chuman nature\u201d can also be understood in exclusively\nexplanatory terms, viz. as the set of microstructural properties\nresponsible for typical human morphological and behavioural features.\nIn such an account, the ability to pick out the relevant organisms is\nsimply presupposed. As we shall see in\n section 4\n of this entry, accounts of this kind have been popular in the\ncontemporary debate. The subtraction of the classificatory function of\nthe properties in these conceptions has generally seemed to warrant\nwithholding from them the label \u201cessentialist\u201d. However,\nbecause some authors have still seen the term as applicable\n(Dupr\u00e9 2001: 162), we might think of such accounts as\nconstituting a third, weak or deflationary variant of\nessentialism.\n\nSuch purely explanatory accounts are descendants of the second use of\n\u201chuman nature\u201d in the traditional package, the difference\nbeing that they don\u2019t usually presuppose some notion of the\nfully developed human form. However, where some such presupposition is\nmade, there are stronger grounds for talking of an\n\u201cessentialist\u201d account. Elliott Sober has argued that the\nkey to essentialism is not classification in terms of necessary and\nsufficient conditions, but the postulation of some \u201cprivileged\nstate\u201d, to the realisation of which specimens of a species tend,\nas long as no extrinsic factors \u201cinterfere\u201d (Sober 1980:\n358ff.). Such a dispositional-teleological conception, dissociated\nfrom classificatory ambitions, would be a fourth form of\nessentialism. Sober rightly associates such an account with Aristotle,\nciting Aristotle\u2019s claims in his zoological writings that\ninterfering forces are responsible for deviations, i.e., morphological\ndifferences, both within and between species. A contemporary account\nof human nature with this structure will be discussed in\n section 4.\n\nA fifth and final form of essentialism is even more clearly\nAristotelian. Here, an explicitly normative status is conferred on the\nset of properties to the development of which human organisms tend.\nFor normative essentialism, \u201cthe human essence\u201d or\n\u201chuman nature\u201d is a normative standard for the evaluation\nof organisms belonging to the species. Where the first, third and\nfourth uses of the expression have tended to be made with critical\nintent (for defensive exceptions, see Charles 2000: 348ff.; Walsh\n2006; Devitt 2008; Boulter 2012), this fifth use is more often a\nself-ascription (e.g., Nussbaum 1992). It is intended to emphasise\nmetaethical claims of a specific type. According to such claims, an\norganism\u2019s belonging to the human species entails or in some way\ninvolves the applicability to the organism of moral norms that ground\nin the value of the fully developed human form. According to one\nversion of this thought, humans ought be, or ought to be enabled to\nbe, rational because rationality is a key feature of the fully\ndeveloped human form. Such normative-teleological accounts of human\nnature will be the focus of\n section 5.2.\n\nWe can summarise the variants of essentialism and their relationship\nto the components of the traditional package as follows:\n\n\nType of essentialism\nRelationship to the traditional package \n\npurely classificatory\nequivalent to TP5 \n\npurely explanatory\nunspecific version of TP2 \n\nexplanatory-classificatory\ncombines TP5 with an unspecific version of TP2 \n\nexplanatorily teleological\nequivalent to TP3 \n\nnormatively teleological\nequivalent to TP4 \n\n\nSection 2\n and\n section 5\n of this entry deal with the purely classificatory and the normative\nteleological conceptions of human nature respectively, and with the\nassociated types of essentialism.\n Section 3\n discusses attempts to downgrade TP5, moving from essential to merely\ncharacteristic properties.\n Section 4\n focuses on accounts of an explanatory human nature, both on attempts\nto provide a modernized version of the teleological blueprint model\n (\u00a74.1)\n and on explanatory conceptions with deflationary intent relative to\nthe claims of TP2 and TP3\n (\u00a74.2\n and\n \u00a74.3).\n",
