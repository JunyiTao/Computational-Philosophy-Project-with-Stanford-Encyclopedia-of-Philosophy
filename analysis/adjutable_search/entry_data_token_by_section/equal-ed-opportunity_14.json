    "main_text": "Equality of Educational Opportunity\u2019s Tensions with Other Values || Education and the Family\n4.1 Education and the Family\n\nFamily background has long been recognized as a source of significant\ninequalities. Even before we consider that children have quite\ndifferent personalities and needs, inequality in family wealth and\ndifferences in family priorities and wield influence over a\nchild\u2019s prospects in the labor market, in civic participation,\nand in overall well-being. Although the number of parents who choose\nto pay tuition to have their children educated in private schools may\nbe relatively small, purchasing elite private schooling can result in\ncompounding advantages for some students (and thus relative\ndisadvantages for others). Only about 10% of primary and secondary\nstudents in the U.S. attend private schools (see NCES\u2019s the\nCondition of Education 2016 in\n Other Internet Resources),\n while students who attended private secondary schools have comprised\nnearly 30% or more of matriculating classes at some highly selective\nAmerican universities in recent years (see, for example, online\nprofiles of the 2016 freshman class at Harvard, Stanford, and Yale\nlisted in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Students at some public schools may also suffer more immediate\ndisadvantages from the absence of the positive peer effects of being\nin a school with higher achieving students and more engaged parents.\nSmaller class sizes, more highly qualified teachers, and more\nextra-curricular opportunities may enable private school students to\nbenefit from the compounding advantages of greater success in the\ncollege admissions process and subsequent labor market. And since\nemployment opportunities and elite college places are scarce goods\nthat are closely linked to other benefits in health, wealth, and\noverall well-being, these inequalities can be highly\nconsequential.\n\nWhile some of these inequalities might be remedied by social policies\nthat address employment practices, gender and racial inequality, and\nwealth inequality, we have reasons to think that some inequality in\nopportunity will remain in a just society simply because parents\nshould be able to treat their children differently from other\npeople\u2019s children in ways that are to their children\u2019s\nadvantage. For example, a parent may read bedtime stories to his\nchildren but if he does he does not also need to read them to other\nchildren, even if a failure to read to everyone exacerbates\ninequality. There are limits to what the state can do without\nintruding on the life of the family. At the same time, concern for\nmitigating inequality that is rooted in familial relations has to\ngrapple with the fact that different parenting styles have value as\nwell as downsides, and that the middle-class norm of trying to\nmaximize children\u2019s potential (\u201cconcerted\ncultivation\u201d; Lareau 2011) is no exception in terms of having\ncertain disadvantages for children.\n\nThere are several possible approaches to the conflict between equal\neducational opportunity and the family. One approach subordinates our\nconcern for equality of educational opportunity to our concern with\nthe family. To support this view we might try to argue that the goods\nof family life are especially weighty, or, that as a matter of value\npluralism, the state cannot impose complete uniformity on childrearing\npractices. Conversely, we could subordinate our concern for the family\nto our concern with equality of educational opportunity. If this were\nto happen, however, we could end up abolishing the family as we know\nit, since the family and partiality run contrary to equal opportunity.\nOne cannot, it seems, have the family and have perfect equality of\nopportunity. Plato famously advocated raising children in common\nwithin communities in The Republic (though not out of concern\nfor equality). But most philosophers, including Rawls, believe that\nabolishing the family is far too high a price to pay for equality\n(this is discussed in Munoz-Dard\u00e9 1999; Brighouse & Swift\n2009; Schoeman 1980; Schrag 1976; see also Miller 2009 on different\nconceptions of equality of opportunity and how the family fits within\nthem).\n\nAlternatively, we might think that some careful weighing of the values\nat stake is required. For instance, we might think that only some of\nthe demands of familial partiality, those related to intimacy such as\nreading bedtime stories, are sufficient to outweigh concern for\nequality of educational opportunity. Other aspects of familial\npartiality that appear to be unconnected to intimacy, such as paying\ntuition for private schools, would not be justified. This view would\nenjoin us to equalize children\u2019s educational opportunities\nwhenever we can, without sacrificing the goods central to the family\n(Brighouse & Swift 2014). Yet it can be very difficult in practice\nto determine whether an advantage parents provide their child is\nconstitutive of the family or not.\n",
