    "main_text": "Analyzing Morally Significant Social Issues || Climate Change and the Environment\n6. Conclusion\n\nMany of the early applications of game theory to ethics were limited\nto contractarian theories and work exploring the relationship between\nmorality and rationality. It has increasingly come to be an important\ntool in the study of applied problems in moral and political\nphilosophy, though, and this promises to become even more true as the\nnumber of scholars working on issues at the intersection of\nphilosophy, politics, and economics increases. That said, game theory\nremains an important tool for analyzing the function of morality and\nfor identifying some of its necessary features. And new contributions\nto the social contract tradition continue to be made using ever more\nsophisticated applications of game theoretic tools.\n\nHowever, even if the use of game theory in ethics has become more\nwidespread, many moral and political philosophers remain skeptical of\nthis trend. One worry voiced by skeptics is that game theoretic\nanalyses often rely on simplifying assumptions that give us reason to\ndoubt how relevant these analyses are to real world problems. For\ninstance, individuals are rarely the selfish utility maximizers game\ntheory so often assumes. This worry is misplaced for two reasons.\nFirst, most philosophers inclined to use formal methods in their work\nare acutely aware of the assumptions they rely on. This doesn\u2019t\nmean that formal work never uses misguided models or assumptions, or\nthat we shouldn\u2019t look critically at the conclusions we draw\nfrom game theoretic analysis and other formal work like it. But when\nresults are interpreted correctly they can be extremely helpful. For\ninstance, when simplifying assumptions are made for the sake of\ncomputational tractability, they can provide a useful tool for\nnarrowing down future lines of inquiry. And sometimes simplifying\nassumptions are made so that we might ask speculative questions such\nas whether rational utility maximizers could reason their way into\nmorality, as is the case in the social contract tradition. Second, at\nthe end of the day, formal models aren\u2019t really so different\nfrom the thought experiments that are perhaps more familiar in\nphilosophy. One advantage of game theory and other formal tools,\nthough, is that they force the philosopher using them to be explicit\nabout the assumptions they are making, and they often allow the adept\npractitioner to say something precise about where the action is and\nhow various assumptions affect things.\n",
