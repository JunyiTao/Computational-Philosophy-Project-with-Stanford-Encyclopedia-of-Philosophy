This picture assumes that the earlier and\ncurrent self are stages in the life of one entity, so that, despite\nthe talk of local interests associated with each life-stage, there is\nan underlying continuity of interests between the two. But this is a\nvery substantial assumption, and it has been contested by appeal to an\ninfluencial account of the metaphysics of\n personal identity\n over time, the psychological continuity account. Roughly,\nthe idea is that, in the wake of a drastic transformation of one's\npsychology such as Alzheimer's disease, one does not survive as\nnumerically the same individual, so whatever interests one's\npredecessor in one's body may have had are not a suitable basis for\ndecisions on behalf of the new individual who has emerged after the\ntransformation (Dresser 1986). The lack of identity between the earlier\nand current self undercuts the authority of the former over the\nlatter.\n\n\nThis approach works best in cases in which we can assume that the\nnew entity emerging after the psychological transformation is still a\nperson: the interests of the earlier self cannot dictate how the\ncurrent self ought to be treated because it would be a clear violation\nof the rights of persons to allow one person to usurp the affairs of\nanother. (Some may doubt whether loss of numerical identity without\nloss of personhood is even possible in any real-life cases of dementia\nor brain damage, but the theoretical point still holds.) What, though,\nif the psychological deterioration is indeed severe enough to strip the\nresulting entity of the capacities of a person?\n\n\nSome might see the loss of personhood as a particularly clear-cut\nsign of a change in numerical identity: if the current self is not even\na person, surely the current self cannot be the same person as the\nearlier self. However, as David DeGrazia has emphasized, this line of\nreasoning rests on an undefended (and controversial) assumption that we\nare essentially persons (DeGrazia 1999). For if we are not essentially\npersons \u2014 but, rather, for example, conscious minds of some other,\nless complex kind \u2014 an individual may very well lose the properties of\na person without any threat to his numerical survival.\n\n\nNonetheless, even if we are not essentially persons, on the\npsychological view of our identity, we are essentially defined by our\npsychological properties. If these properties change drastically\nenough, the old individual ceases to exist and a new individual comes\ninto existence. And the transformation of a person into a nonperson\ndoes seem to be a drastic psychological transformation. Thus, even if\nDeGrazia is right that loss of numerical identity does not\nautomatically follow from loss of personhood, it is certainly\npossible, and perhaps even likely, on the psychological view of our\nidentity, that a transformation of a person into a nonperson would\ninvolve such a profound psychological alteration as to result in a\nnumerically new being. How should we adjudicate conflicts between the\nearlier and the current individual in such cases?\n\n\nOn one view, if a person turns into a new individual in the later\nstages of dementia, this by itself undercuts the authority of the\nearlier person over her successor, regardless of whether the successor\nis a person or not. After all, why should an altogether different\nindividual dictate how the current self is to be treated? However, more\nnuanced positions can also be found in the literature. Buchanan and\nBrock (1990) see the authority of the earlier self in cases of loss of\nnumerical identity as crucially dependent on whether the current self\nis still a person. They accept that if the current self is a person, it\nwould be a violation of her rights as a person to allow another\nindividual to commandeer her affairs. However, if the current self is\nno longer a person, he lacks the same rights. And, as Buchanan and\nBrock see it, the earlier self has \u201csomething like a property\nright\u2026 to determine what happens to [his] nonperson successor\u201d\n(166). That is, if one ceases to exist by turning into a nonperson, one\nretains a quasi-property right to control the resulting nonperson,\npresumably in much the same way that, when one ceases to exist by\nturning into a corpse, one has a quasi-property right to control the\nresulting corpse. Hence, on this approach, even if the earlier and\ncurrent self are distinct individuals, the earlier self has the\nauthority to determine what happens to the current self, so long as the\ncurrent self has been stripped of personhood. In this way, the idea of\na threshold of capacity beyond which the earlier self gains authority\nto dictate the current self's affairs is resurrected, despite the\nassumption that the earlier and current self are not the same\nindividual. But, this time, the basis of the authority is different: it\nis not grounded in the continuity of overall interests between the two\nselves, but rather in the earlier self's quasi-property right. Note,\nthough, that the claim that quasi-property rights could extend to\nrights over successors who are nonetheless conscious beings is\ncontroversial and requires further defense.\n",
