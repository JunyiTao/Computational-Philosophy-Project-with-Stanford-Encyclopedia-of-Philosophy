    "main_text": "Architectural Experience, Knowledge, and Appreciation || Architectural Appreciation\n6.3 Architectural Appreciation\nAs distinct from mere experience of architectural objects,\nappreciation of architectural objects brings to bear\ncognition and other inputs, such as history and context. Appreciation\ngoes beyond knowledge, too, insofar as we may know an\narchitectural object and its qualities without appreciating it. Thus,\nWinters (2007) proposes that appreciating architecture consists in\nenjoyment of architectural objects (from experience, tout\ncourt), as wed to understanding them, where the latter\nconsists in grasping their aesthetic significance in specifically\nvisual fashion, and critically assessing the judgment of architects in\naddressing design challenges. Architectural appreciation may be built\non the judgment of others; it is essential to rendering\njudgment. Accordingly, learning to appreciate architectural objects is\na cornerstone of architectural education. A key contributing feature\nin this last regard is acquiring agility with classifying in the\ndomain (Leder et al. 2004).\nThe appreciation and judgment of architectural objects are\ntypically thought to reflect aesthetic and utility-wise\nconsiderations, and engage individual perspective, experience,\nreasoning, and reflection such as we associate with appreciating and\njudging in other artforms. Drivers in appreciation and judgment\nspecial to architecture include social framing and\nenvironmental psychological factors that are a consequence of\narchitecture\u2019s intensely public nature.\nExceptionalism. One question regarding\nappreciation is whether there is a special mode attached to\narchitectural objects. We might think this is so given that, unlike\nmost arts (though very like other design forms), appreciation in\narchitecture is aesthetic and utility-oriented. A resulting\npuzzle is whether, and under what circumstances, we might have one\nwithout the other. We might think as much if, say, it is possible to\nappreciate the Roman Coliseum\u2019s stately and antique features\nwithout any appreciation of its intended function or actual use. On\nthe other hand, a view of appreciation embracing functional beauty\ntheory may suggest that the Coliseum\u2019s functional and free\nbeauty are on at least equal footing\u2014or that the\nColiseum\u2019s stately aesthetic and its role as amphitheater for\nstaging spectacles (for example) cannot be separated altogether.\nFurther questions regarding appreciation concern the relative roles\nin appreciation of individual experience of architecture, as against\nthe social or the environmental.\nIndividual Appreciation. The prevailing\nphilosophical view of architectural appreciation is a psychological\naccount with debts to the Kantian tradition: direct, immediate\naesthetic experiences of architectural objects among individuals\nconstitute the basis of appreciation. (Iseminger 1981 provides a\ngeneral aesthetics account in this vein.) A primary variant has it\nthat architectural appreciation is the product of individual cognition\nof the content, form, properties, and relations of architectural\nobjects. A recent variation suggests that, in addition to (or in\nlieu of) cognitive response, physiological experience\n(proprioception) is a central source of beliefs associated with\narchitectural appreciation. On either model, it is experience of\nindividuals that feeds and influences appreciation.\nSocial and Environmental Role in Architectural\nAppreciation. Direct, immediate individual experience is not\nthe only source of information shaping architectural\nappreciation. Considering the breadth of the architectural enterprise,\nit may not even be the best source. Others include access to\ninformation about works through standard representational modes that\nare not the works themselves (for example, drawings or photographs),\ntransmission of tacit working knowledge through apprenticeship\nlearning, and collective belief formation through client briefings and\nstudio crits.\nArchitectural appreciation is social in building on our\nunderstanding of architectural objects as it develops, and matures, in\nexperience of a built structure with and in relation to other\nindividuals and groups of people. It is also social in that we learn\nmarkers of appreciation among those with whom we share such\nexperiences or (per Scruton 1979/2013) imagine ourselves to\ndo so. Indeed, a central goal of architectural education is structured\nimparting of collective wisdom as to how to best classify\narchitectural objects and, relatedly, what the markers of appreciation\nhave looked like, or should look like\u2014as well as how they\narticulate with practical knowledge.\nFurther, architectural appreciation is environmental in\nbuilding on our understanding of architectural objects based on\nexperiences in relation to their natural and built surroundings.  On\none view, an architectural object may be more difficult to appreciate\nif we find that relation unexpected, or contrary to normative\nsensibility (Carlson 1999). If, however, appreciation does not require\nenjoyment or satisfaction of any sort\u2014and instead engages our\nunderstanding of, for example, what was intended and why\u2014we may\nwell appreciate in its own right an architectural object that has a\nsurprising, even obnoxious relation to its surroundings.\n",
