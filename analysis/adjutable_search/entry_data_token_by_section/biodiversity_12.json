    "main_text": "The Ecology/Ecosystem Services Framings || History\n4.4 History\n\nA within-ecosystems focus, and typical neglect of global biodiversity\noption value, sometimes has been supported by an accounting in which\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d historically had been recognised as all\nabout intrinsic value, until the ecosystem services framing forged\nlinks for the first time to anthropocentric values (for discussion,\nsee Faith 2018b).\n\nThe rationale for the ecosystem services framing presents two\nprincipal approaches to conservation:\n\n\nCaricaturing slightly, the first is focused on biodiversity\nconservation for its own sake, independent of human needs or desires.\nThe second is focused on safeguarding ecosystem services for\nhumanity\u2019s sake: for the provision of goods, basic life-support\nservices, and human enjoyment of nature. (Balvanera et al. 2001:\n2047)\n\n\nThe ecosystems framing sees the ongoing loss of biodiversity as a\nvalues failure that calls for a shift to ecosystem services\nvalues:\n\n\nDespite appeals about the intrinsic value of nature and important\ngains in some areas, the dominant flow of human activity has continued\nmoving in directions detrimental to biodiversity conservation \u2026\nIn response, some within the conservation community have attempted to\nbroaden the base of support for biodiversity conservation by adopting\nthe concept of ecosystem services and by arguing that the conservation\nof biodiversity matters not only because of its intrinsic value but\nbecause it is essential for human well-being. (Reyers et al. 2012:\n503)\n\n\nThus, in this historical accounting the ecosystems framing forged the\nfirst links from \u201cbiodiversity\u201d to anthropocentric\nvalues.\n\nA popular history of ecosystem services (G\u00f3mez Baggethun et al.\n2010) similarly presents the original motivation for considering\necosystem services as helping biodiversity conservation:\n\n\nIt starts with the utilitarian framing of beneficial ecosystem\nfunctions as services in order to increase public interest in\nbiodiversity conservation (Westman 1977\u2026).\n(G\u00f3mez-Baggethun et al. 2010: 1209)\n\n\nIn reality, Westman did not refer to biodiversity (nor \u201cbiotic\ndiversity\u201d). Instead, Westman linked functions to various\naspects of ecology, including \u201chow components of the system\ninteract\u201d (1977: 961) and \u201cthe flow of materials and\nenergy\u201d (1977: 963).\n\nCustomised narratives in the ecosystem framing are apparent also in\nPeterson et al.\u2019s (2018: 1) reference to:\n\n\nthe notion of the \u201cmaintenance of options\u201d type of\nnature\u2019s contributions to people (NCP 18; D\u00edaz et al.\n2018), enhancing \u201cthe capacity of ecosystems to keep options\nopen in order to support a good quality of life\u201d (D\u00edaz et\nal. 2018: SM).\n\n\nThis would seem to make a strong case for a focus on ecosystems, but\nPeterson et al. misquote this foundational paper on NCP.\n\u201cMaintenance of options\u201d in fact is described (D\u00edaz\net al. 2018: Table S1) as the \u201cCapacity of ecosystems, habitats,\nspecies or genotypes to keep options open in order to support a good\nquality of life\u201d. The misrepresentation gives the impression\nthat the maintenance of options is only about how ecosystems support\nhuman-well-being.\n",
