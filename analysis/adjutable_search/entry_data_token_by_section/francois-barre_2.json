As they make progress in this search for truth, they\ncannot avoid noticing that we are full of prejudices, and that it is\nnecessary to get rid of them completely in order to acquire clear and\ndistinct knowledge. (T1en 119; TTfr\n 53)[1]\n\n\nThis paragraph is an excellent summary of Descartes\u2019 method for\nthe search for truth as it is presented in all his major works. In the\nDiscours de la m\u00e9thode, for example, Descartes writes\nthat \n\n\nsince I now wished to devote myself solely to the search for truth, I\nthought it necessary to [\u2026] reject as if absolutely false\neverything in which I could imagine the least doubt, in order to see\nif I was left believing anything that was entirely indubitable. (CSM\nI, 126\u2013127; AT VI, 31\u201332) \n\n\nIt is notable that Poulain\u2019s reference to the necessity of\ngetting completely rid of prejudices follows the radical\nnature of Descartes\u2019 doubt and its emphasis on rejecting\neverything as false, unless it is entirely indubitable.\nPoulain is true to Descartes\u2019 terminology also at the end of the\ncited paragraph, where he refers to certain knowledge as \u201cclear\nand distinct\u201d. In Principia philosophiae (part I,\n\u00a7 45), Descartes emphasizes that in order to \u201cserve as the\nbasis for a certain and indubitable judgment\u201d a perception needs\nto \u201cbe not merely clear but also distinct\u201d (CSM I, 207; AT\nVIIIA, 22). By \u201cclear\u201d he means that \u201cit is present\nand accessible to the attentive mind\u201d and in order to be\n\u201cdistinct\u201d it must, in addition to being clear, be\n\u201cso sharply separated from all other perceptions that it\ncontains within itself only what is clear\u201d (CSM I, 208; AT\nVIIIA, 22).\n\nIn De l\u2019\u00e9ducation des dames Poulain extends his\ndiscussion of methodological doubt and attributes this method to\nDescartes. The character Stasimachus explains how no other author\n\u201chas better discussed prejudice nor countered it more\nconvincingly\u201d (TTen 242; TTfr 277). The egalitarian aspect of\nDescartes\u2019 method is also emphasized and Stasimachus points out\nthat \u201calmost all of us have enough reason and good sense to seek\nthe truth\u201d, which is found when \u201cwe have formed clear and\ndistinct ideas\u201d (ibid.). Poulain\u2019s text is a very close\necho of the first paragraph of Descartes\u2019 Discours de la\nm\u00e9thode, where he famously claims that \n\n\nthe power of judging well and of distinguishing the true from the\nfalse\u2014which is what we properly call \u2018good sense\u2019 or\n\u2018reason\u2019\u2014is naturally equal in all men. (CSM I, 111;\nAT VI, 2) \n\n\nPoulain\u2019s take on Descartes\u2019 philosophy is explicitly\nmethodological and he adds that Descartes is to be trusted because he\nprovides the best \u201cmethods and principles\u201d (TTen 242; TTfr\n277). Adopting Descartes\u2019 method means that one has to\ncritically examine its author as well as other authors, and\nStasimachus concludes his presentation by emphasizing that\n\n\nI am not claiming that Descartes is infallible or that everything he\nproposed is true and unproblematic, or that one has to follow him\nblindly, or that others couldn\u2019t find something as good or even\nbetter than he has left us. All I am saying is that I believe him to\nbe one of the most reasonable philosophers we have, whose method is\nthe most universal and the most natural, the one that most closely\nconforms to good sense and the nature of the human mind, and the most\nlikely to distinguish the true from the false even in the works of the\none who is their author. (TTen 243; TTfr 278)\n\n\nIn addition to Descartes\u2019 method of doubt, Poulain also adopts\nhis scientific method and his discussion of the order of the sciences,\nas it is presented in the preface to the French translation of\nPrincipia philosophiae (see also Pellegrin 2013; Reuter 2017:\n34\u201337). Descartes famously compares the whole of philosophy,\nwhich is here understood as including all different forms of\nknowledge, to a tree, where the \n\n\nroots are metaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging\nfrom the trunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to\nthree principal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals. (CSM I,\n186; AT IXB, 14) \n\n\nDescartes\u2019 metaphor emphasizes the unity of the sciences and\nthis idea is taken up by Poulain, who replaces the metaphor of a tree\nwith that of the human body. In De l\u2019\u00e9ducation\nhe writes that \u201cthere is a necessary relationship and dependence\nbetween all the sciences, quite similar to those between the different\nparts of the human body\u201d (TTen 208; TTfr 239).\n\nPoulain puts less emphasis than Descartes on the hierarchical\nstructure of sciences implied by the original metaphor of a tree, but\nhe does adopt Descartes\u2019 emphasis on physics and in De\nl\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 he uses the idea of the unity of\nthe sciences in order to argue that women are as able as men to master\nall forms of knowledge. Here Poulain is arguing against those who\nclaim that women are unable to hold civil offices and to rule over\nothers and he points out that these people\n\n\nfail to notice that the mind needs only discernment and accuracy in\nall its actions, and that anyone who displays these qualities in one\ncontext is capable of applying them as easily and in the same way to\neverything else. Morality and social science do not change the nature\nof our actions; the latter always remain physical, [\u2026] Once\nsomeone understands the laws of motion in natural philosophy, they can\napply them to all changes and all variations that occur in nature.\nSimilarly, if someone has once understood the true principles of the\nsocial sciences, they do not experience a new challenge when applying\nthem to novel situations that occur. (T1en 174; TTfr\n116\u2013117)\n\n\nPoulain does not seem to reduce knowledge of morality to knowledge of\nphysics, but he emphasizes that there is a methodological unity, which\nmakes it possible to compare the way in which true principles are\napplied in the natural and the social sciences. His argument\ncriticizes the Scholastic tradition in two ways. First, he argues\nagainst the common view (originally presented by Aristotle) that since\nwomen\u2019s deliberative faculty lacks sufficient authority, women\nhave difficulties governing themselves and therefore cannot govern\nothers (Aristotle, Politics 1260a12\u201314). Second,\nPoulain criticizes the idea, dominant among the Scholastics, that\ndifferent forms of knowledge require different methods and that\ntheoretical reasoning does not as such ground practical judgment (see\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 1140b1\u20137, for the\ndistinction between practical reason (fronesis) and\ntheoretical knowledge). Defenders of women, who, like Christine de\nPizan, wrote within the Aristotelian tradition, found it necessary to\nargue separately that women are as capable as men in their practical\njudgment as in their theoretical reasoning (see in particular\nLivre de la Cit\u00e9 des Dames [The Book of the City of\nLadies], 1405, part I, chap. 43). Poulain\u2019s argument is novel in\nits emphasis on the unity of science, from which it follows that if\nwomen are capable of theoretical reasoning, which was a less\ncontroversial claim, they are also capable of practical judgment. This\nargument is directly based on the criticism of Scholastic science that\nDescartes develops in the preface to the French translation of\nPrincipia philosophiae and which culminates in the idea of\nthe unity of all the sciences (CSM I, 185\u2013186; AT IXB,\n12\u201314).\n\nIn Descartes\u2019 metaphor, metaphysics constitutes the roots of the\ntree of philosophy and we must therefore assume that one cannot be a\nCartesian philosopher without adopting Descartes\u2019 metaphysics.\nPoulain did do so, though he was, as we will see in the next section,\nless profoundly influenced by it than by Descartes\u2019\nphilosophical methodology.\n",
