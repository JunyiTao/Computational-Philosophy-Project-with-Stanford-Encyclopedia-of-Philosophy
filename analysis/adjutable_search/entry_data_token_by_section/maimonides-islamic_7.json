Active Intellect, Human Intellect, Immortality, and Prophecy\n\n\nWe have seen the Islamic philosophical context of Maimonides'\ncosmology of separate intellects (the \u201cangels\u201d), with\nactive intellect at the helm of the sublunar world in which we\nlive. For Maimonides\u2014as for his Islamic philosophical\npredecessors and contemporaries\u2014the active intellect is an\nimportant governing principle for the sublunar realm, a cosmic\nintellectual principle which, in addition to whatever other roles it\nplays in the workings of our terrestrial realm, plays a crucial role\nin human knowledge\u2014including prophecy, and in fact serves even\nas the foundation for a theory of immortality.\n\n\nWith Islamic philosophers before him, Maimonides describes the active\nintellect as an overflow from God which overflows onto humans, giving\nthem knowledge and leading them towards perfection. Expositing the\nPsalms 36:10 verse, \u201cFor with Thee is the fountain of life; in\nThy light do we see light,\u201d Maimonides explains that\n\n\nthrough the overflow of the intellect that has overflowed from Thee\n[i.e., God], we intellectually cognize, and consequently we receive\ncorrect guidance, we draw inferences, and we apprehend the intellect.\nUnderstand this. (G 2.12, P 280)\n\n\n\n\nCommenting on this cosmic dynamic at the very start of the Guide,\nMaimonides understands the Genesis 1:26-27 idea that man was created\n\u201cin the image\u201d of God as pointing to the divine link\nbetween God and man found in the human intellect (and its link to\nactive intellect):\n\n\nNow man possesses as his proprium something in him that is very\nstrange as it is not found in anything else that exists under the\nsphere of the moon, namely, intellectual apprehension\n(al-idr\u0101k al-\u2018aql\u012b). In the exercise of this,\nno sense, no part of the body, none of the extremities are used; and\ntherefore this apprehension was likened unto the apprehension of the\ndeity\u2026It was because of this something, I mean because of the\ndivine intellect (al-\u2018aql al-il\u0101h\u012b) conjoined\n(al-mutta\u1e63il) with man, that it is said of the latter\nthat he is in the image of God and in His likeness\u2026 (G\n1.1; P 23; Pines' use of italics indicates Maimonides' use of Hebrew\nin his text; for Arabic, see Munk 1931, 15).\n\n\n\n\nIt is in our intellectual apprehension that we are most like unto\nGod. In fact, described not only as a likeness to God but as\nan overflow from God, the human moment of intellect may be\nseen as the mark of divine presence in man. Bemoaning the absence\namong humans of a pure state of fully actualized intellect, Maimonides\nallegorically exposits the Genesis Biblical account of Adam's\ntransgressions in the Garden of Eden as man's falling away from his\nGod-given intellect\u2014an intellect, described above as a\n\u201cdivine intellect\u201d here described further as an overflow\nfrom God:\n\n\nFor the intellect that God made overflow (af\u0101\u1e0da;\nMunk 1931, 16) unto man and that is the latter's ultimate perfection,\nwas that which Adam had been provided with before\ndisobeyed. It was because of this that it was said of him that he was\ncreated in the image of God and in His likeness\u2026(G\n1.2; P 24; Pines' use of italics indicates Maimonides' use of Hebrew\nin his text).\n\n",
