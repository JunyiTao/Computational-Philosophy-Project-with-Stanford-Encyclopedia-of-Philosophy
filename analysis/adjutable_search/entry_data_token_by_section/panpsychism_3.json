    "main_text": "Varieties of Contemporary Panpsychism || Panpsychism Versus Panprotopsychism\n2.3 Panpsychism Versus Panprotopsychism\nIt is worth mentioning a position very similar to panpsychism, namely panprotopsychism. Whereas panpsychists think that consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous, panprotopsychists think that proto-consciousness is fundamental and ubiquitous. The properties that characterise conscious experience are commonly referred to as \u201cphenomenal properties\u201d; and hence the properties involved in proto-consciousness are referred to as \u201cprotophenomenal properties\u201d.[11]\nIn the first instance, we can think of protophenomenal properties as properties that are not themselves forms of consciousness but which in combination give rise to forms of consciousness. However, as Daniel Stoljar (2010) has pointed out, this definition is too broad, as anybody who believes that consciousness is not fundamental holds that it is constituted of some other properties, and hence believes in properties which are \u201cprotophenomenal\u201d in this sense. Standard forms of physicalism will turn out to be forms of \u201cpanprotopsychism\u201d on such a definition.\nTo get around this problem, a fuller definition of \u201cprotophenomenal properties\u201d would define them as properties that in certain combinations transparently account for the existence of consciousness, in the sense that one could in principle move a priori from knowing the relevant facts about protophenomenal properties to knowing the relevant facts about phenomenal properties (Chalmers 2015; Goff 2015, 2017). That is to say, if you could magically perceive the protophenomenal properties in my brain (assuming panprotopsychism is true), you would in principle be able to deduce what it\u2019s like to be me. This would distinguish panprotopsychism from the standard contemporary form of physicalism\u2014that advocated by proponents of the so-called \u201cphenomenal concept strategy\u201d (Loar 1990; Papineau 1998; Diaz-Leon 2010)\u2014according to which there is no explanatory entailment from the physical to the mental. We can further stipulate that the explanatory entailment advocated by the panprotopsychist does not hold (solely) in virtue of the kind of properties physical science reveals to us, thus distinguishing panprotopsychism from more radically reductive views such as analytic functionalism.\nThus, protophenomenal properties have a kind of indirect definition, in terms of their propensity to ground consciousness. Different forms of panprotopsychism are distinguished by what if anything they have to say about the positive nature of protophenomenal properties. Many panprotopsychists think we currently have no positive conception of the nature of protophenomenal properties. Indeed, some have argued that we are constitutionally incapable of ever forming one. This view was dubbed \u201cmysterianism\u201d by Owen Flanagan, and is most associated with Colin McGinn (1989; McGinn does not use the label \u201cpanprotopsychism\u201d to describe his view, but it fits the definition laid out in this section).\nPerhaps the most promising conception of protophenomenal properties is given by the view Herbert Feigl (1960) called \u201cpanqualityism\u201d, crediting it to a conversation with Stephen C. Pepper. Versions of the view itself were held by William James (1904), Ernst Mach (1886), Bertrand Russell (1921), David Armstrong (1961), and Peter Unger (1999). More recently the view has been prominently defended by Sam Coleman (2012, 2014, 2015, 2016). According to panqualityism the protophenomenal properties are unexperienced qualities. Our conscious experience is filled with experienced qualities, e.g., those phenomenal qualities involved in seeing colour or feeling pain. Panqualityists believe that such qualities are only contingently experienced, and that in basic matter they exist unexperienced.\nPanqualityists typically give some kind of reductionist account of how such unexperienced qualities come to be experienced, such as a functionalist account according to which for a quality to be experienced is for it to play the right causal role in the cognitive capacities of the organism. Thus, panqualityism can be seen as a kind of middle way between panpsychism and physicalism.[12] Whereas the physicalist thinks that we can give an entirely reductive account of consciousness, and the panpsychist thinks that consciousness is fundamental, the panqualityist thinks that that the qualitative aspect of consciousness is fundamental, whilst holding a reductive view of subjectivity, i.e., the fact that those qualities are experienced.\nTom McClelland (2013, 2016) defends a form of panprotopsychism that combines elements of mysterianism with the kind of reductive account of subjectivity favoured by the panqualityists. McClelland is a mysterian about the basic features of matter that give rise to the qualitative properties we encounter in our experience, but like Coleman he hopes that we may be able to give a reductive account of how those qualities come to be experienced.\nFor some other defences of panprotopsychism or closely related views, see Stoljar (2001), Holman (2008), Montero (2010, 2015) and Pereboom (2011, 2015, 2019).\n",
