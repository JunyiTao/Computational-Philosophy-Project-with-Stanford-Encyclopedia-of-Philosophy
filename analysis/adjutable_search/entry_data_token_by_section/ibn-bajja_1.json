    "main_text": "Logic\n3. Logic\n\nAvempace inserted his classification of the sciences into the\nEisagoge, a treatise whose aim is to discover the simple\nuniversal categories underlying the parts of the sentences. His master\nAlfarabi added the chapters on definition, borrowed from the\nAristotelian Analytica Posteriora. Alfarabi had also\nintroduced, at the beginning and in his enumeration of the parts of\nthe sentence, the distinction between \u201csound\u201d\n(laf\u1e93) and \u201cmeaning\u201d\n(ma\u201bn\u00e0) and said:\n\n\nEvery predicate and every subject is either a sound signifying a\nmeaning or a meaning signified by a certain sound, and every meaning\nsignified by a sound is either universal or individual.\n(Eisagoge, Dunlop 1956: 119.1\u20132)\n\n\nAvempace observes that \u201csubject\u201d and\n\u201cpredicate\u201d are ambiguous terms because they may refer to\nmeanings as well as to sounds, and what Alfarabi considers in this\nbook are the meanings, not the sounds (IB-taaliq: 30. 6\u20138).\nAccording to their meaning, both parts of the sentence are either\nuniversal or individual. Avempace then follows Alfarabi and divides\nuniversal parts into simple and composite: simple parts of the\nsentence are genus, species, specific difference, property, and\naccident. Composite parts are the definition, the description, and\n\u201can expression the composition of which is restricted, and is\nneither a definition nor a description\u201d (IB-taaliq: 30.\n16\u201317). Avempace\u2019s meaning here can only be understood by\nreading Alfarabi\u2019s Eisagoge. Alfarabi defined it as an\nexpression which\n\n\nis made up of species and an accident, as when we say of Zayd that he\nis a white man and sometimes it is made up of accidents, as when we\nsay of Zayd that he is an excellent secretary. (Eisagoge,\nDunlop 1956, translation p.\n 137)[11]\n\n\nThe nine categories or sorts are parts of the syllogisms (IB-taaliq:\n30. 18\u201319), according to Avempace and his observations on\n\u201csubject\u201d and \u201cpredicate\u201d are linked to the\nsciences which are built on syllogisms. The philosophical sciences,\ndialectic and sophistry, have universal subjects and predicates.\nPoetry and rhetoric have individual subjects and universal predicates.\nRhetoric employs one or more individual subjects as well as predicates\nin cases in which the syllogism resorts to an image or to\n corroboration[12].\n\nAvempace knew the difficulties of bringing together the Porphyrian\nEisagoge with the Aristotelian corpus as well as the\nneed to classify and organize the sciences. He did not leave us a\nsystematic treatise, but only wrote comments on Alfarabi\u2019s\nwritings. In spite of it, we can perceive a model that starts with the\ndivision of \u201cmeaning\u201d into individual and universal,\ncontinues with the distinction between simple and composite\nuniversals, inserts the doctrine of the categories, moves toward the\nconstruction of syllogisms, and develops into the variety of sciences\naccording to their syllogistic nature or not. Let us deal with the\nplace of the categories.\n\nThe Oxford manuscript marks a new chapter in the text with the heading\n\u201cOf his discourse at the beginning of the\nEisagoge\u201d. Here Avempace divides \u201cmeanings\u201d\ninto two kinds: intelligibles (ma\u201bqulat) and\nindividuals (IB-taaliq: 42. 7). Intelligibles can exist either in the\nmind or in something outside of it and they are associated mainly with\nthe universals. Avempace quotes Aristotle\u2019s definition of the\nuniversal: \u201cThat which is by its nature predicated of more than\none thing\u201d (De interp. 17a 39) but he borrows the\nquotation from Alfarabi who commented on the sentence\n(Eisagoge, Dunlop 1956: 119. 4\u201313). Avempace has two\ninterpretations for the passage. The first says: \u201cthat which is\nby its nature\u201d refers to an actual resemblance so that\nuniversals contain similar individuals \u201cat one and the same\ntime\u201d. By contrast, the second interpretation does not limit the\nuniversals to any moment, and Avempace writes:\n\n\n[Aristotle] intended with the expression \u201cthat which is by its\nnature\u201d the natural [character of the universal] and its\ndisposition to resemble more than one, which does not imply that the\nresemblance exists in its actualization. For it is not impossible for\nthe eclipse, insofar it is intelligible, to have a resemblance;\nfurther it is not impossible for the eclipse to be predicated of many.\n(IB-taaliq: 46. 4\u20136)\n\n\nThe concepts of possibility and impossibility come into action and the\nuniversal is defined as having the possibility to resemble more than\none, \u201cthe possibility inhering in the meaning insofar as it is\nintelligible\u201d (IB-taaliq: 46. 10\u201311). On the contrary, the\nindividual lacks such possibility; rather, it is impossible for the\nindividual to resemble more than one.\n\nAny relation, i.e., the Aristotelian category, in order to exist needs\ntwo possibilities, one for each subject of the relation in contrast to\nthe other nine categories, in which one possibility in one subject is\nsufficient. Resemblance is a relation, since it is to be predicated on\ntwo, and both are properties of the classes of intelligibles as well\nas of their individuals. The intelligible relations exist in the\ncategories, not because of their own essence. To sum up, only the\nintelligibles possess the possibility of resembling more than one and\nare predicted to possess many.\n\nFor Avempace, the main purpose of the Eisagoge is to explain\nthe concepts that underlie the ten Aristotelian categories. The first\ninterpretation of \u201cthat which is by its nature\u201d is more\nappropriate to this purpose because the second interpretation affects\nall beings, but the categories do not affect all beings and they deal\nwith existents insofar as the mind acquires them. These concepts are\nof two kinds: simple and composite. The simple ones are the five\nuniversals and the three composite are the definition, the description\nand the aforementioned \u201crestricted composition\u201d.\n\nAvempace affirms that the five predicables are not primitive concepts,\nbut constitute correlations between two universals falling within the\nrules of individuals and classes. He says: \u201cGenus, species,\nproperty and accident are correlates (i\u1e0dafa) which are\ninherent to the intelligibles regarding the quantity of their\nsubjects\u201d (IB-taaliq: 50). Genus, species and property are\nessences inhering in a shared subject; by contrast, the accident is\nnot an essence and exists outside the subject. The specific difference\nis related only to the individual and may be grasped without reference\nto the universal.\n\nAvempace\u2019s annotations to Alfarabi\u2019s Kitab\nal-Madkhal are more innovative than they might seem at first\nsight. He points out that the Eisagoge should not be limited\nto the exposition of the five \u201csounds\u201d\u2014maybe six, if\nthe individual is\n added[13]\u2014and\n that a particular science was needed to lay the foundations for the\nOrganon. He conceives this science as a formal theory of\nindividuals and classes that is followed by the theory of definition\nand description.\n\nAvempace wrote annotations on other logical books of Alfarabi that\nwere edited by M. T. Danishpazhuh (1989) and by Majid Fakhry\n(IB-taaliq), whose edition is complete. The Center of Averroic Studies\nin Fes, Morocco, had started the publication of some of them (Alwozad,\n1988) and completed them in 1997\u20132006 (Avempace, Alwozad,\n1997).\n\nAlfarabi\u2019s books on the Aristotelian Categories, De\ninterpretatione, and the First Analytics, were also\ninterpreted by Avempace. Alfarabi had \u201ccompleted\u201d the\nlatter with a Book of the Analysis and Avempace made an\n\u201cexercitation\u201d on it, Al-Irtiyad fi kitab\nat-Tahlil. His annotation on the First Analytics\ncontains his views on Aristotle\u2019s purpose in introducing the\nsyllogism:\n\n\nThe purpose of Aristotle in his book \u201cAnalytics\u201d is to\ndiscourse on the syllogistic potency (al-quwa al-qiyasiyya)\nbecause he considered that, if he discoursed on the action of the\nsyllogistic potency, he had to do it on the syllogism, just as when he\ndiscoursed on the natural potency, he had to do it on medicine, that\nis its art. (IB-taaliq: 184. 7\u20139)\n\n\nAvempace explains what he understands under \u201csyllogistic\npotency\u201d: Aristotle sometimes would say that many conclusions\nresult from one syllogism, and sometimes not only one, and this\npossibility is interpreted as \u201csyllogistic potency\u201d.\nAccording to Avempace, when Aristotle argues: Every man is an animal\nand every animal is sensible, thus every man is\n sensible,[14]\n he means that by action of the syllogistic potency the conclusion\n\u2018a certain animal is a man\u2019 follows from the assertion\n\u2018every man is an animal\u2019.\n\nAvempace links the inversion to the introduction of the fourth figure\nof the syllogism in which the middle term is the predicate of the\npremise containing the predicate of the conclusion and the subject of\nthe other premise. \u201cSince [Aristotle] discourses on the action\nof the syllogistic potency, he keeps perceiving the fourth figure that\nGalen thought he had ignored\u201d (IB-taaliq: 184. 20\u201321).\n\nThe fourth figure is not rejected by Avempace, who tries to safeguard\nit by using potency in a specific sense, \u201csyllogistic\npotency\u201d. He creates a wider framework in which he places the\n\u201cfive sections\u201d while the core belongs to the standard\nsyllogistic doctrine.\n\nTo this wider framework it belongs Avempace\u2019s use of the\nsyllogism in his book on Coming-to-be and Passing-away. When\nman argues, he accomplishes a kind of mental movement and the movers\nare the premises of the syllogism. Avempace illustrates it with an\nexample: A man takes our money and travels with it towards Cairo. We\ngo after him and we have to stop over in the different places of his\nway up to when we reach the final point, Cairo. Avempace explains us\nthe story:\n\n\nSince the existence of the final aim depends on the accomplishment of\na desire, to grasp it is pleasant, and since no other desire\naccompanies it, it is pleasant with such a delight that no pain\ninterferes it, neither essentially nor accidentally. In all\nintermediate degrees there is pleasure and pain, and in the first\ndegree, that is first matter, only pain. That final aim is permanent\npleasure and first matter is permanent pain. The desired thing is the\nfirst mover and the final aim, so that it is both efficient and final\ncause.The arrangement of the premises is similar to that of motion,\nwhile the concept (tasawwur) is similar to first matter, and\nthe existence of the final aim is the accomplishment. (IB GC 1995: 35.\n7\u201336. 3)\n\n\nThe reference to the syllogism, its premises and its conclusion is far\ndistant, but the topic how man can attain his perfection, and\ntherefore his happiness is present here as it is in most of\nAvempace\u2019s writings as we will see.\n\nThe exercitation on the Analysis (Alwuzad 2006) relates to a\nparticular work by Alfarabi concerning the premises of the syllogism\n(Mallet 1994). Alfarabi placed it between the First and the\nSecond Analytics considering that it provided us with the\nlaws ruling the formation of the premises, something which became\nnecessary after the syllogism had been described. Alfarabi linked the\ntheory of the premises to the topoi \u201cplaces\u201d as\nthey are understood in the Aristotelian treatise with the same title,\nthe Topics. He defined topoi, Arabic\nmawadi\u02bf in these terms:\n\n\nThey are the universal premises the particular ones of which are\nemployed as major premises in every syllogism and every discipline.\nEach topos is employed in many particular premises, some of them are\nemployed in dialectics, others in rhetoric, others in the sciences,\nyet others in the rest of intellectual disciplines (Alfarabi, 1986,\npp. 95. 5\u20138).\n\n\nAccording to Mallet, Alfarabi understood the topoi as the universal\nmatrices of all possible major premises (Mallet, 1992, pp. vol. 1, p.\n127). Mallet does not define \u2018matrix\u2019 in the context, but\nits use shows that the term designates that within which, and from\nwhich, a major premise originates.\n\nAvempace understands it in the same way and comments on the\ntopoi at length. His doctrine of conceptualization\n(tasawwur) is present here also and shows his original\napproach.\n\n\nIf the topoi are conceptualized by that which their\ndefinition completely gives and by the fact that the major premise is\na major premise taken over from the topoi, the definition of\nthe topos is perfect (IB-taaliq: 195. 3\u20135).\n\n\nTopos results from conceptualization and does not exist\noutside the soul. Topos is immaterial, and something general\n(\u02bbamm). \u2018General\u2019 has its own meaning in\nAvempace: it comprises universals (kulliyat) and particulars,\nas well as the specific difference, the definition and its parts, the\ndescription and its parts, properties, accidents, and concomitants,\netc. \u2018General\u2019 helps to elevate the theory of the\ntopoi to a comprehensive theory of syllogisms as vehicles of\nknowledge in all disciplines.\n4. Mathematical Sciences\n\nAl-\u2019Alawi\u2019s exposition of three steps in the intellectual\ndevelopment of Avempace does not conflict with Avempace\u2019s view\nof the sciences. In fact, Alfarabi was active in the three fields in\naddition to the preparatory logic. The first of the three syllogistic\nsciences is mathematics that deals with objects deprived of matter but\nendowed with number and measure. Mathematics contains various\nsciences, among them music and astronomy.\n\nThe biographical sources are informed by Avempace\u2019s expertise as\na musician and as a composer of muwashshaha poetry. In\naddition, he has left us a brief composition on the\n melodies[15].\n Avempace expounds on the therapeutic effect of playing the\n\u201bud, lute, on the basis of universal harmony existing\nbetween the heavenly spheres and the bodily nature, the humors. Each\nchord of the lute is related to one of the four elements: fire, air,\nearth, water, and each chord has a beneficial influence on each\ndisease caused by one of the humors. The chord called zir\nacts on the bile, the chord mathn\u00e0 on the blood, the\nchord mathlat on the black bile, and the chord bam\non the phlegm. Avempace instructs the player how to place the lute on\nhis body and which finger plays which chord. If the musician plays the\nlute in the right way, his day will be most beautiful.\n\nIn his letter to Abu Ja\u201bfar Yusuf Ibn Hasday (IB-coll-alawi:\n77\u201381), Avempace blames the astronomer az-Zarqalluh for not\nhaving properly understood astronomy and attacks him for his\n\u201cTreatise to refute the method employed by Ptolemy to calculate\nthe apogee of Mercury\u201d. This work of az-Zarkalluh is not extant.\nJ. Sams\u00f3 informs us that Ptolemy\u2019s calculation of the\napogee was wrong by approximately 30\u00ba and that az-Zarkalluh\ncalculated the apogee in another work only with an error of 10\u00ba\n(Sams\u00f3 1993\u20131994: 676\u2013677). Avempace, however,\ncriticizes the method that az-Zarkalluh employed.\n\nAvempace wrote a letter to Abu Zayd \u201bAbd ar-Rahman Ibn Sayyid\nal-Muhandis (IB-coll-alawi: 84\u201387) about a preliminary question\nfrom the first book of the Conic Sections of Apollonius of\nPerga (ca. 200 BC). In another letter to his disciple \u201bAli Ibn\nal-Imam (IB-coll-alawi: 88\u201396) Avempace mentions Ibn Sayyid as\nthe discoverer of new procedures in geometry. In addition to this\nletter, one passage in his Commentary on the\n Physics[16]\n and another in the Book of animals (IB-BA: 74) deal with the\nConic Sections in a sketchy way. Ahmed Djebbar studied Ibn\nSayyid and Avempace and gathered that both Andalusians were innovative\nin their study of warped surfaces resulting from the intersection of\nconic and non-conic\n surfaces[17].\n5. Natural Philosophy and Necessity\n\nAvempace commented very freely on the Aristotelian works and wrote\nindependent articles on various subjects of personal interest. We are\nnot always sure which source he read and whether it was the complete\ntranslation or an abridgment. In the case of his commentary on the\n Meteorology,[18]\n we know from Paul Lettinck\u2019s edition and translation of the\ncommentary. Lettinck proved that Avempace read the altered version of\nthe Meteorology made by Yahy\u00e0 Ibn al-Bitriq (d. ca.\n830; Petraitis 1967).\n\nThe Aristotelian treatises dealing mainly with natural philosophy are\nthe Physics, Coming-to-be and Passing-away, On\nthe Heavens, and Meteorology. This is the traditional\norder of their arrangement within the corpus, and the books\non the Animals are last. Avempace followed the order for his\nreading of the corpus, wrote his commentaries accordingly and\ntherefore we should first consider his commentary on the\n Physics.[19]\n\nAvempace defines this science as theoretical, the subject of which is\nthe natural body and says that most of its subject is known by the\nsenses (IB-SS-fakhry: 15.7\u20139). Physics works on the basis of\nprinciples insofar as it is theoretical and searches for causes as its\ndemonstrative science. We should not leave aside the long discussion\non the essence and position of physics in Avempace\u2019s\nintroduction to his Book of Animals.\n\nThere we learned that the matter of physics is strenuous.\n\n\nThis science must employ all the potencies [capacities] developed\npreviously in mathematics and logical and it employs them only insofar\nthey belong to a common genus. (IB-BA: 69. 5\u20137)\n\n\nAvempace finally affirms that natural science has various kinds of\nprinciples and problems, and that it contains objects that are not\nsensible at all, like the intellect.\n\nAvempace makes clear that natural science or physics is a theoretical\nscience which requires mastering other sciences. It is not a science\nlike geometry the objects of which are anterior, both in knowledge and\nin reality. Its objects are posterior in knowledge, but Avempace\nremarks that some are not related to the senses.\n\nMotion is one of the main issues in the Physics and Avempace\nhad original views on the issue. Book VII of the Aristotelian\nPhysics does not fit into the sequence of Books V, VI and\nVIII and its chapters deal with subjects not related to each other.\nOne of them mentions that every movable or mobile is moved by a mover\ndifferent from itself (Phys. VII.1, 241b 24). Avempace\nconsiders the tenet that everything is moved by something else, and\nsays:\n\n\nIt is evident that the rest of the whole caused by the rest of one of\nits parts takes place in so far as the movable is other than the\nmover, and when the influence (athar) of the latter ends, it\ncomes to rest. Its influence ends because the mover ceases to act\neither on its own or because something else exerts resistance on it.\nWhenever the mover ceases to act on its own, this happens due either\nto its destruction, or to exhaustion (kalal) of the power of\nthe mover, or because the cause disappears, or because the motion is\ncomplete, since the movable has reached the end toward which it was\nmoving. (IB-SS-fakhry: 99.16\u201320. Lettinck 1994:\n532\u2013533)\n\n\n\u201cInfluence\u201d is not a technical term, but the words\nfollowing the quoted text clarify it. Motion necessarily takes place\nif a moving power exists in such a condition that enables it to cause\nmotion and if no contrary moving power exerts resistance. If the\nmoving power ceases, its influence does too.\n\nThe movements involved here are so-called \u201cviolent\u201d\nmovements, as opposed to \u201cnatural\u201d ones discussed below.\nAvempace sketches a theory of dynamics based on a notion of\n\u201cpower\u201d different from the Aristotelian notion of\ndynamis: they are mechanical forces which can join another\nforce or counteract it by offering resistance. Shlomoh Pines\nintroduced the term\n \u201cdynamics\u201d[20]\n to define his views, which no doubt were influenced by the tradition\nlinked to John Philoponus (d. ca.\n 566).[21]\n There is a minimum amount of moving power for each movable. For\ninstance, to move a boat a minimum of power is needed, otherwise\n\u201cone grain of sand could move the boat\u201d (IB-SS-fakhry:\n112.27).\n\nWhen two opposing powers are equal, there is no motion, and when one\npower \u201covercomes\u201d the other, the body moves until it\nsuffers \u201cexhaustion\u201d (kalal), because any body\nmoved \u201cviolently\u201d creates a contrary power stronger than\nthe one imposed by the mover, and also because the imposed force\nbecomes \u201cexhausted\u201d. The moving power is also subject to\ntime and distance factors and the mobile can offer almost no\nresistance, so that the absolute terms of proportionality do not\napply.\n\nAnother contribution is related to motion in the void. Avempace\nanalyzes \u201cnatural\u201d movements such as a stone\u2019s\nfalling through air and water. They are the movements of the four\nelemental bodies: fire, air, water and earth. These movables need a\nmoving power capable not only of moving them, but also of displacing\nthe medium through which they pass. Dust particles stay suspended in\nthe air because, although they possess enough power to go down, their\npower is insufficient to displace the air.\n\nAristotle rejected the possibility of motion in the void because the\nmedium was essential to natural movement at finite speed\n(Phys. IV.8). John Philoponus had already expressed the view\nthat the medium is not a necessary condition, but only provides\nresistance. The different velocities with which the stone passes\nthrough the air or the water is only caused by the different density\nof the medium; it is not connatural to the medium. As a proof that\nmotion without any medium, namely, through a void, is possible,\nAvempace adduces the movement of the spheres:\n\n\n[In the heavens] there are no elements of violent motion, because\nnothing bends their movement, the place of the sphere remains the same\nand no new place is taken by it. Therefore, circular movement should\nbe instantaneous, but we observe that some spheres move\nslowly\u2014such as the sphere of fixed stars\u2014and others\nfast\u2014the daily movement\u2014and that there is neither violence\nnor resistance among them. The cause for the different velocities is\nthe difference in nobility (sharf) between mover and movable.\n(IB-SS-fakhry: 116.13\u201317)\n\n\nThe role of the medium is not essential, but is only a kind of\nresistance, and thus motion in the void is both theoretically possible\nand confirmed by the observation of the spheres. Avempace contradicts\nAristotle and advances a doctrine that Galileo will later prove to be\n right.[22]\n The similarity with Philoponus\u2019 doctrine is clear, but an\ninfluence is not certain (Lettinck 1994: 549). Said El Bousklaoui\nshares the view that Avempace\u2019s doctrine although similar to\nPhiloponus\u2019s it is not inherited from it (Bouskaloui 2020).\nBousklaoui links the impetus theory to movement by itself,\n\u201cspontaneously\u201d, but this view needs further\ndevelopment.\n\nThe treatise On the Heavens followed next in the Aristotelian\norder but no commentary of Avempace has reached us, and the following\nextant commentary is on Coming-to-be and Passing-away\n(IB-GC). Avempace coincided with Philoponus in a preliminary remark\nobserving that Aristotle proved in his book On the Heavens\nthe existence of four elementary bodies: fire, air, water, earth.\nSince one of the subjects of Coming-to-be and Passing-away is\nthe mutual generation of these bodies, it is the logical continuation.\nThus, Avempace\u2019s lost commentary On the Heavens likely\ncomes after the one on Physics and before the one on\nComing-to-be and Passing-away.\n\nThis commentary runs parallel to the Aristotelian text. After\nexplaining changes in quality, Avempace suddenly starts a discourse on\nforce or power (quwwa) and on the moving power (quwwa\nmuharrika; IB-GC: 26\u201340). The four elementary bodies are\ndefined by the four possible binary combinations of cold/warm with\nheavy/light. Some of them can be also moving powers:\n\n\nIf the causes of the qualities exist primarily in their subjects and\nbelong to the same species, the qualities are movers [\u2026]\nAbsolute actuality is the existence of this moving power as moving and\nthis is only the case because of the existence of the movable being in\nmotion, and this is coherent if we assume the movable power to exist.\n(IB-GC: 26. 1\u20137)\n\n\nFor Wirmer the passage is one of the pillars, on which he develops the\nontological system based on \u201cPotenz\u201d in Avempace (Wirmer\n2014: 346\u2013352) and, as expected, most of the passages where the\nterm quwwa comes out, are found in his book On the\nSoul.\n\nAvempace does not extend in the issue of elementary qualities as\nmoving powers, and focuses on the soul as a moving power (elemental\nbodies do not have souls; instead, they have natures). The case of the\nhuman soul interests him most and he wants to explain how intellectual\napprehension moves man in reasoning and action. Avempace will deal, in\na more satisfactory way, with the issue of rank of ideas and forms in\nrelation to human activity in other works.\n\nAvempace\u2019s reflections on absolute coming-to-be and passing-away\nstart with a linguistic analysis of the term kawn\n\u201ccoming-to-be\u201d which echoes Alfarabi\u2019s method and\nitself is a novelty (IB-GC: 41\u201344). Avempace stresses that\ncoming-to-be is only possible if the metaphysical structure of act and\npotency are admitted (IB-GC: 46\u201347).\n\nAt the beginning of his treatise of Meteorology, Aristotle\nsummarizes his preceding research: he has established the four causes\nof nature and dealt with all natural motion in Physics. He\nhas investigated the ordered movement of the stars in the heavens in\nDe caelo, and changes of the four elements into one another,\ngrowth, and perishing in De generatione et corruptione. What\nstill has to be investigated is that which takes place \u201cin the\nregion nearest to the motion of the stars such as the Milky Way\u201d\n(Meteo. 338b 3\u20134).\n\nAvempace\u2019s commentary presents his own theory of the Milky Way.\nAristotle explained it as the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some\nstars which were large, numerous and close together. The ignition\ntakes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the\nworld which is continuous with the heavenly motions (Meteo.\n346b 11\u201312). The version transmitted by Ibn al-Bitriq diverges\nand considers the Milky Way to be a phenomenon exclusively of the\nheavenly spheres, not of the upper part of the atmosphere. The light\nof those stars makes a visible patch because they are so close.\n\nAvempace considers the Milky Way to be a phenomenon both of the\nspheres above the moon and of the sublunar region. The Milky Way is\nthe light of many stars which almost touch one another. Their light\nforms a \u201ccontinuous image\u201d (khayal muttasil) on\nthe surface of the body which is like a \u201ctent\u201d\n(takhawwum) under the fierily element and over the air which\nit\n covers.[23]\n Avempace defines the continuous image as the result of refraction\n(in\u201bikas) and supports its explanation with an\nobservation of a conjunction of two planets, Jupiter and Mars which\ntook place in 500/1106\u20137. He watched the conjunction and\n\u201csaw them having an elongate figure\u201d (Lettinck 1999: 434)\nalthough their figure is circular.\n\nAvempace wrote a treatise on animals related to the Aristotelian books\nGeneration of Animals, Parts of the animals, and\nDescription of the animals, and another one on plants\n(As\u00edn Palacios 1940) and probably a third one on minerals, all\nfollowing the Pseudo-Aristotelian\n corpus.[24]\n\nThe Book of Animals was edited by Jawad al-\u201bImarati\n(IB-BA). As said above, Avempace begins his book situating it in the\ncontext of the theoretical sciences, and then within natural science.\nThe science of the living animals is a species of the natural\nphilosophy (IB-BA: 71). Avempace wonders whether the relationship of\nits subject, the animal, is similar to the relationship of arithmetic\nto numbers. Arithmetic is a discipline where the pattern of genus and\nspecies applies smoothly: It establishes ten units, and then it\ncombines them and gives them accidents like being odd or a pair, etc.\nSince numbers are made one of another \u201cten is made of the five\nmultiplied by the two\u201d and they are \u201csimple forms\u201d\nwhich can be continuously incremented (IB-BA: 73) and animals have a\ncompletely different existence, Avempace denies the relationship.\n\nGeometrical objects are similar to numbers, but they differ insofar as\ntheir species are infinite. Avempace mentions infinite figures\n\u201cresulting from [intersecting] the straight line with the\ncircle, either cylinder or conic\u201d. Primary genera of geometry\nare the line, the surface and the body, and Avempace denies any\nparallelism to the swimming, walking and flying characteristics of\nanimals\u2014he uses the term tanasub,\n\u2018proportional\u2019, opposite to tawatu\u2019,\n\u2018univocal\u2019 (IB-BA: 74. 16\u201320).\n\nAs for a possible similarity to the numbers, numerical specific\ndifferences are anterior and actively dividing, not divisible. On the\ncontrary, according to Avempace, the science of the animals goes\nanother way:\n\n\nWe must take the first contrariety inherent to the animals and by\nwhich they are divisible, and whether it belongs to the essential\nuniversal opposite accidents by which the primary species come to\nstand. (IB-BA: 75. 1\u20133)\n\n\nAvempace inquiries further about these basic contrarieties to\nestablish the furthermost species and make possible a demonstrative\nscience.\n\n\nWe predicate of the animals contrary specific differences, like having\nblood or not, and then we can prove it. If we talk about man and about\nbull, we cannot make any specific distinction. (IB-BA: 76.\n7\u20139)\n\n\nAristotle, according to Avempace, classified the science of animals\ninto four sections: 1) properties of the sensible parts of animals, 2)\nproperties of their limbs, 3) properties of their homogeneous sensible\nparts, and 4) properties of their non-homogeneous sensible parts\n(IB-BA: 76).\n\nIf we go into the material content of the book, we find some\nremarkable contributions of Avempace. Remke Kruk points to his\ndescription of the copulation of insects and to the male and female\nrole in the procreative process (Kruk 1997: 172\u2013175).\n\nHowever, the theoretic endeavor of Avempace in his Book of\nanimals seems to be more relevant. Avempace wants to draw a\ntheoretic system embracing all reality. Reality is plenty of forms,\nand their perfection consists of motion and action (IB-BA: 79). He\ndivides forms into natural and artificial. The specific difference is\nthat natural forms possess a power (quwwa) which moves bodies\nand by which bodies move themselves while artifacts only move\naccidentally).\n\n\nArt (sina\u201ba) is the elaborated form abstracted from\nmatter; it is abstracted from its matter. The artificial form which\nexists in its matter does not have any power to move that which is in\nit nor to move something else. This is the difference between\nartificial and natural forms. (IB-BA: 79. 1\u20134)\n\n\nNatural powers are obviously nobler than artificial ones. Avempace\nalso takes modal factors into account for his design and introduces\nnecessity in his discourse. Necessity is predicated of immovable forms\nin its primary sense, and metaphysics deals with them. The natural\nscientist deals with forms subject to motion and, for this reason,\nnecessity can be predicated \u201cby design\u201d\nbi-l-wad\u201b. Avempace gives the following example that\nclarifies what he means with \u201cby design\u201d:\n\n\nIf there is a house, there is a foundation by necessity, and this kind\nof necessity is a relationship between the causes of the existing\n[object] and the final [cause]. If [the final cause] is described, the\nvarious kinds of the causes follow it by necessity, and the form acts\nin a similar way.\n\nIf the form is the final [cause] of a motion, motion follows it by\nnecessity, and it is something evident because, if there is building\nactivity, there will be a house, and if there is building, there is\nthe art of construction, but if there is only the art of construction,\nthere will be no building. If [form] is acquired \u2018by\ndesign,\u2019 the other causes result in a well kept way from the\nfinal cause by necessity. (IB-BA: 81. 6\u201310)\n\n\n\u2018Design\u2019 is the human involvement in the example. In\nnatural philosophy, necessity can be predicated also in another sense.\nAvempace mentions the case of the carpenter who choses an iron hatchet\nbecause of the hardness of its iron; the hatchet as formal cause\ncannot carry its function unless its matter is iron or an alike\nmaterial. He sees here another kind of necessity, intrinsec necessity\nbecause of matter. Following the example, iron melts by the\napplication of fire or it rusts in the soil. Melting and rusting take\nplace by necessity and \u201cnot because the smith intends it\u201d\n(IB-BA: 81. 16).\n\nBy contrast absolute necessity reigns in the heavenly spheres,\nTherefore, Avempace reckons three kinds of necessity: absolute,\n\u201cby design\u201d, and material. Interestingly, Avempace turns\nnow to the lunar eclipses: they happen with absolute necessity in a\ndetermined period of time (IB-BA: 82). As he goes on and discusses\npossibility, Avempace admits possibility in relation to the eclipses,\nbut combined with necessity\u2014he literally says that\n\u201cpossibility shares necessity\u201d. Possibility is present\ninsofar as no specific limits determine the periods of time in which\nthe eclipse exists potentially from those in which it exists actually.\nNecessity shows when it does not exist in a given time because of\nopposed motions caused by opposed unmoved movers.\n\nAvempace considers then the four elements, in which necessity is only\nexistent because the temporal determination. Avempace\u2019s lengthy\nand twisted arguments end with the conclusion:\n\n\nSince the celestial bodies do not have any contrary form, there is\nabsolutely no potentiality (quwwa), and if there is no\npossibility (imkan) in them, there is no coming-to-be nor\npassing-away. (IB-BA: 83. 13\u201316)\n\n\nAs Avempace\u2019s natural philosophy goes beyond the analysis of\nmotion, matter, time and place, it extends to metaphysical principles\nof necessity and possibility which eventually concern human\nbehavor.\n6. Soul and Knowledge\n\nWe have read above that physics aims not only at sensible objects\n(above,), but also spiritual ones\u2014which allows us to\nintroduce Avempace\u2019s book on the Soul. The book was\nedited (IB-S1a) and translated by Muhammad Saghir Hasan\nal-Ma\u201bsumi (IB-S1e) who unfortunately could use only the Oxford\nmanuscript; the Berlin manuscript is longer although its composition\nis less coherent. In 2007 J. Lomba Fuentes used both manuscripts for\nhis Spanish translation (IB-S-lomba) as D. Wirmer has done for his\nGerman version (IB-S-Wirmer).\n\nWhen Avempace starts the book, he proceeds in a similar way to the one\non animals, namely with a comprehensive framing of the subject. Bodies\nare either natural or artificial; all they have in common the presence\nof matter and form; and form is their perfection. Natural bodies have\ntheir mover inside the whole body, because the natural body is\ncomposed of mover and moved.\n\nMost of the artificial bodies are moved by an external mover, although\nautomats or machines have their motor inside, and Avempace adds\n\u201cI have explained it in the science of Politics\u201d\n(which is lost) (IB-S1a: 25. 4; IB-S1e: 15). The mover is identical\nwith the form. He distinguishes two kinds of perfecting forms, namely\nforms moving by means of an instrument or not (IB-S1a: 28; IB-S1e:\n17). The first kind is nature, the second, the soul.\n\nTo define the soul as operating through an instrument, i.e., the body\n\u201cin an ambiguous sense\u201d, as Avempace does (IB-S1a: 29. 2),\nimplies it is autonomous. Avempace defines the soul also as first\nentelechy (istikmal), as opposed to the last entelechy of the\ngeometer, i.e., its being geometer in act. Soul appears as an\nincorporeal substance, of highest rank. The science of soul is\nconsidered by Avempace as superior to physics and mathematics, only\ninferior to metaphysics. Avempace is not disturbed by\nAristotle\u2019s hylemorphic view of the soul which he may have\nknown. He affirms that all philosophers agreed that the soul is a\nsubstance and portrays Plato as the adequate source:\n\n\nSince it was clear to Plato that the soul is assigned to substance,\nand that substance is predicated on the form and matter which is body,\nand that the soul cannot be said to be a body, he fervently defined\nthe soul in its particular aspect. Since he had established that the\nforms of spheres are souls, he looked for the commonality of all\n[souls], and found that sense perception is particular to animals,\n[but] that movement is particular to all, and therefore he defined the\nsoul as \u201csomething which moves itself\u201d. (IB-S1a: 40.\n5\u201341; IB-S1e: 26)\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s treatise is relevant for Avempace in its description\nof the various powers of the soul, i.e., nutritive, sense-perceptive,\nimaginative, rational faculties, although Avempace may have not had\nany Arabic translation of Aristotle\u2019s De\n anima.[25]\n Avempace often digresses into general reflections; for instance, at\nthe beginning of his chapter on the nutritive faculty he talks about\npossibility and impossibility. But, in other places, there are some\nreferences to Aristotle, for instance, when it comes to the\nimaginative faculty. Avempace writes that \u201cThe imaginative\nfaculty is the faculty by which the \u2018reasons\u2019\n(ma\u201bani) of the sensibles are apprehended\u201d\n(IB-S1a: 133. 3; IB-S1e: 106).\n\nMa\u201bn\u00e0 can translate various Greek words, and the\nStoic lekt\u00f3n \u201cmeaning\u201d is the most\nrelevant. The Arab grammarians used the term\nma\u201bn\u00e0, plural ma\u201bani to point to\nthe content of the word, to its semantic component, in contrast to\nlaf\u1e93, its phonic part; the pair ma\u201bn\u00e0\n/ laf\u1e93 is already found in Sibawayhi (d. ca. 796).\nMa\u201bn\u00e0 was frequently used by Islamic theologians\ntoo, to express the concrete cause or \u201creason\u201d of a thing.\nThe Latin intentio of medieval philosophy is used to\ntranslate ma\u201bn\u00e0, and the concept of\nintentio appears close to that intended by Avempace since\nma\u201bn\u00e0 has two characteristics: it is some form\nor figure dissociated from matter but having reference to the thing\nthe figure of form of which it is (Blaustein 1986: 207).\n\nImagination apprehends the internal contents of the sensations and\nanimals operate with them. \u201cIt is the most noble faculty in\nirrational animals, and through it animals move, have many arts, and\nlook after their progeny\u201d. Avempace gives as examples ants and\nbees, which are exactly the kind of animals to which Aristotle denies\nthe faculty! (IB-S1a: 140; IB-S1e: 111).\n\nAvempace begins his chapter on the rational faculty by asking whether\nthis faculty is always actual or sometimes potential and actual. He\nanswers that it is sometimes potential and sometimes actual (IB-S1a:\n145\u2013146; IB-S1e: 117\u2013118). It is just a note without\ncontinuation.\n\nThe main activity of the reasoning faculty is to enquire and to learn.\nAvempace introduces here the discursive faculty (al-quwwa\nal-mufakkira) which binds subject and predicate. The text is\nconfusing and the Oxford manuscript ends inconclusively. The\nBerlin-Krakow manuscript has a few more pages\n(176r\u00ba\u2013179r\u00ba) that Joaqu\u00edn Lomba included in\nhis Spanish translation, as well as Wirmer in his German (IB-S-Wirmer,\n720\u2013727). At the end of the fragment, the unknown editor writes\nthat Avempace\u2019s discourse on the soul is followed by a treatise\non the intellect, i.e., the Epistle of Conjunction of it with\nman.\n\nThe intellect, Avempace affirms, apprehends the essence of something,\nnot something material and individual. The essence of any object is\nits \u201creason\u201d (ma\u201bn\u00e0) which\ncorresponds to its form linked to matter in this case. If we go back\nto a former passage of the same book, we read how the distinction\nis:\n\n\nThe difference between the reason and form is that form and matter\nbecome one thing without existing separately, whereas the reason of\nthe thing perceived is a form separated from matter. So the reason is\nthe form separated from matter. (IB-S1a: 94. 11\u201313)\n\n\nThen the intellect apprehends it in such a way that they\nboth\u2014essence and intellect\u2014are \u201cone in the subject\nand two in expression\u201d. The speculative intellect searches for\nthe essences of material beings, but it is not satisfied with their\napprehension. It realizes that they are material intelligibles which\nneed further foundation and Avempace contends that the intellect knows\nthat there are superior intelligibles which found them and strives for\nthem (Mss. Berlin 176 v\u00ba). The fragment contains these and other\nnotes which are difficult to bring together although they are in\nharmony with other writings of Avempace. We may refer to his\nexposition of the \u201cspiritual forms\u201d in the Rule of the\nSolitary as more relevant.\n\nFinally, we should mention his text in defense of Alfarabi, accused of\ndenying survival after\n death.[26]\n There, Avempace argues that since man has knowledge of intelligibles\nbeyond sense-perception and since it occurs by means of introspection,\nit is a divine gift to man who has no need for the matter to survive\nafter death.\n7. Ethics and Metaphysics\n\nAvempace illustrated for us his views on how knowledge is organized\nand how the world of nature is structured, but we have not yet\nexpounded on his proper ideas on metaphysics, nor on the sciences that\naim at beings produced by the human will and choice, namely, ethics\nand politics.\n\nAvempace\u2019s most representative works are the Rule of the\n Solitary,[27]\n the epistle of the Farewell\n Message,[28]\n and the Epistle of Conjunction of Intellect with\n Man.[29]\n The latter work contains references to Rule of the Solitary\nand to the epistle of the Farewell Message (as well as to his\nbook on the Soul).\n\nAlfarabi\u2019s major work is Book of the opinions of the\ninhabitants of the righteous\n city[30].\n It is an exposition of a Neo-Platonist emanationist system as well of\nthe different kinds of societies. Alfarabi wanted a perfect city,\nruled by a righteous man parallel to the rule of the universe by the\nperfect One. His connecting cosmogenic explanations and political\nplans were known to Avempace who did not follow him. Avempace does not\nquote this or other works by Alfarabi which have a similar content. He\nquotes Plato but follows the opposite way. While Plato in the\nRepublic would take the human soul as the model for the\nperfect city, so that the perfect organization inside it tells how the\ncity has to be organized, Avempace starts from the ideal city and\nwants to transfer its organization to the individual (Abb\u00e8s\n2011: 86).\n\nAvempace echoes Plato and mentions his division of cities, or\nsocieties, into a perfect one and others which are corrupted\n(IB-RS-AP: 5\u20136; IB-coll-genequand: 123; IB-RS-berman: 125). One\nassumes that Avempace is referring to the four imperfect cities,\nnamely, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny\n(Republic, viii-ix) although As\u00edn Palacios interpreted\nthem as the four imperfect cities cited in Alfarabi\u2019s works\n(IB-RS-AP: 37, note 6), and Genequand accepts both possibilities\n(IB-coll-genequand: 256 \u00a713)\n\nThe virtuous city is the only that can make its inhabitants happy\nbecause they achieve their perfection. It is characterized by the\nabsence of the art of medicine and the art of adjudication. Avempace\nfollows Plato, but his version is also characterized by the absence of\nweeds (IB-RS-AP: 10. 16\u201318; IB-RS-berman: 126;\nIB-coll-genequand: 126 \u00a732). Avempace explains that in imperfect\ncities there are false opinions, but that the majority of inhabitants\naccept them as right, or that there are contradictory positions and\nthat there is no way to know which one is true.\n\n\nNow the people who discover a right action or learn a true science\nthat does not exist in the city belong to a class that has no generic\nname. As for the ones who stumble upon a true opinion that does not\nexist in the city or the opposite of which is believed in the city,\nthey are called weeds. (IB-RS-AP: 10. 8\u201311; IB-coll-genequand:\n126, \u00a731; IB-RS-berman: 127)\n\n\nE.I.J. Rosenthal already pointed to the different evaluation of the\n\u201cweeds\u201d by Alfarabi and Avempace (Rosenthal 1951).\nAvempace borrows the concept from Alfarabi who saw these men as a\ndanger in the imperfect as well as the perfect city. Avempace saw the\nvirtuous city free of weeds, because it is free from false opinions.\nWeed-men spring up only in the imperfect cities, and they can help in\ncorrecting their views. However, he realized that they were strangers\nin the cities or societies of his time, which all belonged to the\ncorrupted types, and he did not believe that these societies could be\nrehabilitated; he abandoned Alfarabi at this point and addressed the\n\u201cweed-men\u201d.\n\nAvempace wrote a book of a genre similar to that which physicians\nwrite to preserve and acquire health, the so called tadbir\nas-sihha. He referred to Galen and what Galen wrote in the\nPreservation of Health as a model for his Rule of the\nSolitary. To preserve physical health requires knowledge of the\nnatural science about delivering justice, for example, and knowledge\nof political science. Avempace concluded that since his treatise aims\nat acquiring and preserving spiritual health, \u201cit reverts to the\nnatural and political science\u201d (IB-RS-AP: 12.15\u201316;\nIB-RS-berman: 129; IB-coll-genequand: 128 \u00a738). What binds\nnatural and political science? Forms, insofar as men have similar and\ndifferent forms, and forms are related to nature.\n\n\u201cForm\u201d acquires a broad sense for Avempace who\ndistinguishes various kinds of it. Forms are known as the intelligible\nessences of objects. Avempace accepts this meaning. For him, however,\nforms have something in common, namely, moving power, and forms are\nintegrated into a participating hierarchy. Avempace\u2019s doctrine\nof the forms is no doubt original, although antecedents are found in\nthe Neo-Platonist tradition. He once quotes a treatise \u201cOn the\nSpiritual Forms\u201d misattributed to Alexander of Aphrodisias\n(IB-coll-fakhry: 166. 16\u201317; IB-CIM: 18) which S. Pines (1955)\ndemonstrated to belong to Proclus. Alfarabi\u2019s Risala fi\nl-\u201baql (1938) and other of his works contain the principles\nof the participating hierarchy of intellects and intelligibles (cf.\nDavidson 1992; Ram\u00f3n Guerrero 1992).\n\nThus, man\u2019s actions belong to different levels according to the\ndifferent forms found in man: physical, animal and spiritual. The\nlatter are specific to man; we can know which actions are most\nappropriate to man only if we know what is his essence, namely, his\nmost excellent form. Therefore, Avempace accompanies his Regimen\nsanitatis with a following Treatise on the spiritual\nforms, lengthier than the former. Steven Harvey already insisted\nthat his epistemology allows us to understand his attitude about\npolitics, and that is not something accidental (Harvey 1992: 212).\nAvempace assigns the term \u201cspiritual\u201d to the soul insofar\nas it is \u201ca moving soul\u201d. This may be too broad a\ndefinition, but he then specifies the various kinds of\n\u201cspiritual forms\u201d\u2014all having the capacity to\nmove:\n\n\nThe spiritual forms are of various kinds: the first are the forms of\nthe circular [i.e., heavenly] bodies, the second are the active\nintellect and the acquired intellect, the third are the material\nintelligibles (ma\u201bqulat), the fourth are the\n\u201creasons\u201d (ma\u201bani) existent in the\nfaculties of the soul, i.e., existent in common sense, in the\nimaginative faculty and in the memory. (IB-RS-AP: 19.2\u20135;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 49.16\u201319; IB-coll-genequand: 132 \u00a758)\n\n\nThe heavenly bodies are not only immaterial for Avempace and the long\nAristotelian tradition, but they are also the most spiritual and are\nfollowed in rank by the class of the active intellect and the acquired\nintellect. The active intellect is immaterial, but the acquired\nintellect has some connection to matter \u201cbecause it perfects\n(mutammim) the material intelligibles\u201d (IB-RS-AP: 19.\n10; IB-coll-genequand: 133 \u00a759: \u201cil\nactualize\u201d). The latter are \u201cnot spiritual per\nse because their existence takes place in prime matter\u201d\n(IB-RS-AP: 19. 7\u20138; IB-coll-genequand: 132 \u00a759), and we\nassume that they are the internal counterpart of the substantial\nforms. We see that spiritual forms differ from similar forms which are\njoined to matter and determine the substances.\n\nAvempace does not give us any instance of \u201cmaterial\nintelligibles\u201d, but we may well think of the idea of a tree or a\nhorse in our mind. In his later treatise on the Conjunction of\nIntellect with Man, Avempace differentiates between intelligibles\nof real existing beings such as the horse, and intelligibles of\nnon-existent beings, such as a one-legged man, and he further\ndifferentiates between intelligibles of real existing beings which one\nhas seen, and intelligibles of existing being which one has not seen.\nFor Avempace, the latter are intelligibles in a derivative sense or by\nanalogy (IB-CIM: 15; IB-coll-fakhry: 163; IB-coll-genequand: 191\n\u00a727). \u201cMaterial intelligibles\u201d should contain both\ncategories.\n\nThe objects of common sense, imagination, and of memory are not\nintelligibles; they are ma\u2018ani, \u201creasons\u201d.\nThe term is ambiguous, but it is clear that a \u201creason\u201d is\nthe cognitive product of any of these three faculties and it is also\nclear that \u201creason\u201d is some spiritual form.\n\nAccording to Avempace, spiritual forms divide into universal and\nparticular forms: universal forms are found in the active intellect\nand the individual intellect apprehends them too. Particular forms are\nfound in common sense, and Avempace gives the instance of a certain\nmount in Arabia. The \u201cspiritual\u201d content of the forms in\nthe common sense is lower than in the forms of the imagination, and\nthat of the latter ones is lower than in the forms of the memory\ninsofar as their content is more and more \u201ccorporeal\u201d. The\nforms of the rational faculty\u2014we may say, the material\nintelligibles\u2014are not corporeal (IB-RS-AP: 21. 2\u20133;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 50; IB-coll-genequand: 132 \u00a761). Avempace seems\nto be aware of the difficulties of his explanation, and later on the\nsame treatise he summarizes the views:\n\n\nWe say: The form of any generated corruptible being has three grades\nof existence, the first is that of the universal spiritual form which\nis the intelligible form and is the species, the second is that of the\nparticular spiritual form, and the third that of bodily form.\n\nThe particular spiritual form has again three grades, the first is\nthat of the \u201creason\u201d existing in the memory, the second is\nthat of the picture (rasm) existing in the imaginative\nfaculty, and the third is the image (sanam) or the common\nsense. (IB-RS-AP: 31.13\u201332.1; IB-coll-fakhry: 58.10\u201315;\nIB-coll-genequand: 141\u2013142, \u00a790)\n\n\nParticular spiritual forms may be true or false; if they have come to\nus through the common sense, they are mostly true. Spiritual forms\nplay a role in every aspect of human life, even in the prophetic\nrevelation. The inspiration received by the prophets belongs to the\ncategory of particular spiritual forms, which do not pass through the\ncommon sense, but are received directly from the active intellect.\nAvempace wrongly refers to Aristotle in support of his view and view\nand ends by saying \u201cThese instances go beyond the natural world,\nthey are divine gifts\u201d (IB-RS-AP: 24. 7; IB-coll-fakhry: 53;\nIB-coll-genequand: 136 \u00a771).\n\nAs for the Sufis, their experiences belong to the level of the\nparticular spiritual forms, where common sense, imagination and memory\nare active, but they mistake them for universal spiritual forms, and\nwrongly believe that the coincidence of the three faculties is the\nsource of supreme happiness (IB-RS-AP: 26\u201327; IB-coll-fakhry:\n55).\n\nMan has to organize his various faculties\u2014from the rational to\nthe nutritive\u2014and there are categories of men according to the\nprevalence of each of the three faculties. In some of them,\ncorporeality prevails; in a select few, spirituality does. Avempace\ncounts some ascetics and Sufis among the latter\u2014but for most,\nthe situation is mixed. Man is moved by spiritual forms that may be as\nbasic as clothing, housing or food. Clothing, for instance, acts on\ntwo levels, the protective and the ornamental. Virtues are attached to\nthe spiritual forms found in the imaginative faculty because the\npurpose of virtuous actions is generating positive feelings and\nadmiration in the souls of those who see them. The spirituality of\nmost men is, however, limited to particular forms. Only philosophers\nattain the highest degree of spirituality, the immaterial and\nuniversal intelligibles. Although philosophers have to take due care\nof the corporeal and particular spiritual forms in order to live, and\nlive honorably, their main concern is the universal separated\nforms:\n\n\nSpiritual acts render him nobler, and the intellectual acts render him\ndivine and virtuous. The man of wisdom is therefore necessarily a man\nwho is virtuous and divine. Of every kind of activity, he takes up the\nbest only. He shares with every class of men the best states that\ncharacterize them. But he stands alone as the one who performs the\nmost excellent and the noblest of actions. When he achieves the\nhighest end\u2014that is, when he apprehends simple substantial\nintelligences (\u201buqul) that are mentioned in the\n[Aristotelian] Metaphysics, the book On the Soul,\nand On Sense and the Sensible\u2014he then becomes one of\nthese intelligences. It would be right to call him simply divine, and\nhe will be free from the mortal sensible qualities, as well from the\n[particular] spiritual qualities. (IB-RS-AP: 61.11\u201318;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 77; IB-RS-berman: 131\u2013132; IB-coll-genequand:\n163\u2013164, \u00a7164\u2013165)\n\n\nIn his later treatise Conjunction of Intellect with Man,\nAvempace reformulated his theory. He addressed the treatise to his\ndisciple Ibn al-Imam and complained about lack of time because of his\nnumerous occupations. For this reason he chose a non technical way to\ndescribe how man first acquires the spiritual forms, then he\napprehends the intelligibles, and by means of the latter he approaches\nthe final intelligence, whose intelligible is itself. He calls it the\nnatural way: each man has a material intellect which receives them and\nthe intelligibles are relative to each material intellect (IB-CIM: 17;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 164; IB-coll-genequand: 193 \u00a732).\n\nHe distinguished three stages, the first is that of the common people\nand their intelligibles are linked to the material objects; the second\nis that of the natural scientists or philosophers, and their\nintelligibles are linked to the spiritual forms. (IB-CIM: 18;\nIB-coll-fakhry: 167; IB-coll-genequand: 196 \u00a741). The third is\nthat of the blessed. Avempace knew Plato\u2019s Republic and the\nallegory of the cavern, he recalls it in order to exemplify these\nstages:\n\nThe condition of the common people regarding the intelligibles is\nsimilar to the condition of the vision of people who are in a cave\nwhere the sun does not rise: they look, and they see all the colors in\nthe shadow (IB-CIM:19; IB-coll-fakhry: 168; IB-coll-genequand: 198\n\u00a747).\n\n\nAvempace does not talk about Ideas but intelligibles and he groups the\nprisoners in Plato\u2019s allegory with the common people, while he\ndistinguishes two categories among those who have gone out of the\ncavern: The theoreticians (na\u1e93ariyyin, philosophers)\nand the blessed (su\u02bbada\u2019). For Plato, those who\nhave gone out of the cavern are the educated citizens who master the\nart of dialectic, but Avempace is not satisfied with an indirect\napproach to the last intelligence and wants to reach and acquire the\nabsolute intelligibles, free of any relation to the material\nintellects and free of any spiritual form (particular or universal):\nit is the third and final stage that has no equivalence in\nPlato\u2019s two categories of men.\n\nWe are informed that absolute intelligibles are the true existence and\nthat they merge into the one last intelligence. Avempace never says\nthat God is the last intelligence, which he compares with the sun and\nits light. The felicitous person who succeeds in reaching the highest\nstep of knowledge becomes light himself (IB-CIM: 19; IB-coll-fakhry:\n168; IB-coll-genequand: 198 \u00a746). But, in this stage, he abandons\nany articulated scientific knowledge and dips into a wordless mystical\nexperience.\n\nBy contrast, practical intelligibles play a minor role in spite of the\nimport they have in ethics and politics. Avempace includes among them\nthe ruling of the city or of the armies and considers them\n\u201cintermediate forms\u201d. They exist in the solitary only for\nthe sake of one of the three spiritual forms, corporeal, particular\nspiritual and universal spiritual (IB-coll-fakhry: 91;\nIB-coll-genequand: 179 \u00a7210).\n\nAs we said above, Avempace presented his Rule of the Solitary\n(Tadbir al-mutawahhid) as a Regimen sanitatis in\norder to acquire and preserve spiritual health, which obviously equals\nto happiness (IB-RS-AP: 11; IB-coll-fakhry: 43; IB-RS-berman: 128).\nThe companion he gave to Ibn al-Imam for his travel, the Epistle\nof Farewell, was intended to help him attain spiritual happiness.\nAvempace enumerates the different degrees of pleasure, the highest\nbeing science. Man suffers from ignorance and when he reaches the\ntruth, pain goes away and pleasure seizes him. However, intellectual\npleasure is also caused by the very fact of knowing.\n\n\nBut when we strive for knowledge, we do it not because of pleasure but\npleasure is some profit (ribh) we gain as it follows the\nexistence of the truth, because every pleasure is like the shadow of\nsomething else. (IB-CIM: 23. 5\u20137; IB-coll-fakhry: 123.\n2\u20134; IB-coll-genequand: 98 \u00a729)\n\n\nAvempace enquires further on the issue of pleasure and knowledge, and\nwe can abbreviate it by saying that the highest form of pleasure\nrequires continuity and that continuous pleasure is attained not only\nby intellectual knowledge but also by knowledge of an eternal object.\nMetaphysical knowledge is man\u2019s uppermost stage and source of\nhighest pleasure. Averroes (d. 1198), however, would express doubts\nwhether man\u2019s uppermost stage is a natural perfection or divine\ngift for Avempace, an issue which Alexander Altmann researched (1965).\nAltmann concluded that Avempace defended the uppermost stage as a\nmystical experience, similar to that preached by the Sufis, and in any\ncase we can agree that Avempace saw the uppermost stage as a divine\ngift.\n\nAvempace concluded his enquiry moving out of the rational and leaving\nmany loose ends. He was a busy man. When he finished his treatise\nOn the Conjunction of Man with Intellect he apologized for\nnot having been able to produce a demonstrative argument,\nburhan, on the issue and uttered his hope that the addressee\nof the epistle would be able to grasp its sense and meaning (IB-CIM:\n22\u201323; IB-coll-fakhry: 172\u2013173; IB-coll-genequand: 203\n\u00a760). Still, the outlines of his system are visible.\n\nInspired by the Porphyrian division of the five voices, knowledge\nstarts with the opposition universal/individual, and develops into\nsyllogistic and non-syllogistic sciences which can explain all aspects\nof reality. Reality consists of matter and forms, but form\ndifferentiates into a stairway of forms, according to their distance\nfrom matter. Forms are essences as well as active potencies, and any\nform is a mover. In addition, the ascension of spiritual forms inside\nman runs parallel to the ascension of forms in nature. They both unite\nin separate substances, pure intelligibles, and true beings, and at\nthe summit, man merges into the Active Intellect. Avempace\u2019s\nintention appears clear, but whether the conjunction is possible and\nhow it occurs remains obscure.\n\nEven if no metaphysical interpretation of Avempace\u2019s thought\nwould be accepted, his ethical doctrine would remain indisputable.\nAvempace was clearly concerned by man\u2019s fragile nature and the\never-threatening presence of death (Alwuzad 1994) but he was convinced\nthat man could master his destiny with the sole means of his\nintellectual capacity and resolve.",
