    "main_text": "Three Models of Temporal Consciousness || Time and Consciousness\n1.1 Time and Consciousness\n\nTime and consciousness are interwoven on several levels. From the\nvantage point of ordinary life and common sense, consciousness plainly\nseems to exist in time. When we hear the clock strike twelve,\nour auditory experience of it so doing also occurs at twelve (or at\nmost a few moments later). Watching a 120-minute action movie results\nin a two hour stream of auditory and visual experiences (along with\naccompanying thoughts and feelings), and this stream runs concurrently\nwith the playing of the movie. Quite generally, our conscious states,\nirrespective of their kind or character, seem to occur in the same\ntemporal framework as events in the wider world. But this is by no\nmeans the whole story.\n\nThere are also ways in which time or temporality might be regarded as\nmanifest within consciousness. We can judge the duration of\ntemporal intervals, particularly short ones, with reasonable\naccuracy\u2014an ability that psychologists have investigated in\nconsiderable detail (see Wearden 2016 for an overview). Our episodic\n(or autobiographical) memories supply us with access to our own pasts;\nthanks to such memories our earlier states of consciousness are not\naltogether lost to us: they can be recreated (or relived), albeit\nimperfectly, in our present consciousness. And of course there are\npast-oriented emotions, such as remorse or regret or shame: through\nthese the past can influence our present feelings, often in powerful\nways. While there is no future-directed counterpart of memory, we can\nanticipate future happenings (more or less accurately, more or less\neagerly), and experience future-directed emotions: fear, dread,\nhope\u2014and these too can exert a powerful influence of our present\nstates of consciousness.\n\nThe story is still by no means complete, for temporality is manifest\nin consciousness in a further and more intimate way. In our ordinary\nexperience, over brief intervals, we seem to be directly aware of\ntemporally extended phenomena such as change, persistence and\nsuccession. When we see a friend waving goodbye, do we infer\nthat their arm is moving, on the basis of having observed a motionless\narm occupying a sequence of adjacent spatial location? We do make such\ninferences of this kind: if I see that my neighbour\u2019s dustbin is\nin the middle of the road rather than its usual position on the\npavement, I (rightly) infer that it has been moved. But the case in\nquestion is not at all like this: what we see is simply an arm in\nmotion. (Is it for nothing that cinema is often called \u201cthe\nmoving image\u201d?) The same applies in other sensory modalities.\nWhen listening to a melody, we hear each note giving way to its\nsuccessor; when we hear a sustained violin tone, we hear the\ntone continuing on, from moment to moment. If temporally extended\noccurrences such as these can feature in our perceptual experience, it\nis natural to conclude that our awareness must be capable of embracing\na temporal interval.\n\nWhile this may seem obvious, it can also seem problematic. We can\nremember the past and anticipate the future, but we are only directly\naware of what is present\u2014or so it is natural to suppose. But the\npresent, strictly speaking, is momentary. So, if our awareness is\nconfined to the present, our awareness must itself lack temporal\ndepth. Hence, we are led swiftly to the conclusion that our direct\nawareness cannot possibly encompass phenomena possessing temporal\nextension. We are thus confronted with a conundrum: it seems our\nawareness must extend over time, but it seems it can\u2019t.\n\nIn grappling with this \u201cparadox of temporal awareness\u201d as\nit is sometimes called, different philosophers have proposed quite\ndifferent accounts (or models) of the structure of this form of\ntemporal consciousness. Simplifying somewhat, the most discussed\noptions fall into three main categories:\n\nCinematic Model: our\nexperiences lacks any (or any significant) temporal\nextension\u2014they are akin to static, motion-free\n\u201csnapshots\u201d or \u201cstills\u201d. Our streams of\nconsciousness are composed of continuous successions of these static\nconscious states. In this respect they are analogous to movies, which\n(as displayed) consist of rapid sequences of still images.\nRetentional Model: our\nexperiencing of change and succession occurs within episodes of\nconsciousness which do not themselves possess any (or any significant)\ntemporal extension, but whose contents present (or represent)\ntemporally extended intervals and phenomena. These episodes thus have\na complex structure, comprising momentary phases of immediate\nexperience, along with representations (or retentions) of the\nrecent past. Our streams of consciousness are composed of successions\nof states of this kind.\nExtensional Model: our\nepisodes of experiencing are themselves temporally extended, and are\nthus able to incorporate change and persistence in a quite\nstraightforward way. Our streams of consciousness are composed of\nsuccessions of these extended phases of experience.\n\n\n\n\n\na. Cinematic Model\n\n\n\n\nb. Retentional Model\n\n\n\n\nc. Extensional Model\n\n\nFigure 1.1 The Three Main Conceptions of\nTemporal Consciousness. [An\n extended description of Figure 1.1\n is in the supplement.]\n\n\nIn his influential writings on these matters William James argued that\nto make sense of our temporal experience we need to distinguish the\nstrict or mathematical present from the experiential\nor specious present: whereas the first is indeed\ndurationless, the second is experienced as possessing a brief\nduration, sufficient to accommodate the change and persistence we find\nin our immediate experience. Proponents of the cinematic model\nmaintain that James was mistaken: to make sense of our temporal\nexperience we don\u2019t need anything resembling an extended\nspecious present. Proponents of the extensional and retentional views\nmaintain that we do need something resembling a specious\npresent, but offer very different accounts of\n it.[1]\n\nAscertaining where the truth lies among the differing accounts of\ntemporal consciousness is interesting in itself. Although most forms\nof experience seemingly feature succession and persistence\u2014even\nthe most primitive forms if James was correct in characterizing infant\nconsciousness as a \u201cblooming, buzzing\nconfusion\u201d\u2014many philosophers have not found it easy to\nunderstand how any form of experience can have such\n features.[2]\n The interest and importance of the debate does not end here, for each\nof the accounts of temporal awareness on offer has significant, and\nvery different, implications for our understanding of the general\nstructure of consciousness. In this entry we will be exploring the\nprincipal features and motivations of the competing accounts, as well\nas their strengths and\n weaknesses.[3]\n",
