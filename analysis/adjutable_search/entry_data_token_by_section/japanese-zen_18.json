    "main_text": "Zen\u2019s Understanding of Time and Space || An Integrated Time and Space\n7.3 An Integrated Time and Space\n\nJust as importantly, Zen maintains that time and space are lived as\nintegrated space-time in the interfusion of a concrete\ntemporalization and spatialization. For example, D\u014dgen speaks of\nit as \u201cbeing-time\u201d (u-ji) to indicate their\ninseparability; being cannot be apart from time, and time\ncannot be apart from being, where a being spatializes through\nthe process of temporalization, and where it temporalizes through the\nprocess of spatialization. This is a concrete\nspatialization-temporalization that is lived without any intellectual\nabstraction, reflecting the Buddhist position that everything,\nwithout exception, is impermanent. Zen abhors an intellectual\nabstraction that merely thinks time and space. This is\nbecause the Zen person rides on the rhythm of living nature. That is,\n\u201chere and now\u201d is one experience (and hence \u201cnot\ntwo\u201d), and for this reason they should be designated as\n\u201chere-now.\u201d \n\nIn living this integrated, living space-time, Zen does not understand\ntime to be a quantifiable (the move prepared by Aristotle\u2019s\nunderstanding of time as the measurement between before and after) and\nhomogeneously punctuated unit (i.e., the clock time of natural\nscience). Nor does it conceive of it as a linear progression from past\nto future through the present, although it does not exclude them\ninsofar as they are useful for everyday life. The negation of the\nlinear idea of time also includes the negation of the idea of time as\nsymmetrical and reversible, because in the Zen experience of\nspace-time, a teleological intentionality, an \u201cin order\nthat,\u201d is absent. Yet Zen does not accept time as a\n\u201cfleeting image of eternity\u201d (as in Plato). Zen\nunderstands time to be living. According to Zen, theories of time\nbuilt through conceptual abstraction are distanced and separate from\nthe immediacy of \u201chere-now.\u201d \n\nSpace, too, is neither a container (as with Newtown\u2019s\n\u201cabsolute space\u201d) nor an a priori limiting\ncondition (as in Kant), nor the place of displacement for the volume\nof an extended thing (as in Aristotle). Rather it is a living\nspace. D\u014dgen for example captures this sense of space as\n\u201cthe bird flies the sky and the sky flies the bird.\u201d In\nthis statement D\u014dgen recognizes the independence of the sky and\nthe bird, but also recognizes that the sky and the bird each become\nthemselves only through their interdependence. In other words, what\nmakes this space a living space is the dynamic,\ninterdependent, bilateral play of both bird and sky, from which the\nliving space-time as the continuum of \u201chere-now\u201d emerges\nas an ambience, where each of the terms entering the relationship\nthrough the activity is granted a full recognition of their being.\nThis is because the Zen person lives the dynamic activity of\nnon-dualistic \u201ccoming-together\u201d of \u201cthe two,\u201d\nwhether this \u201ctwo\u201d happens to involve the\n\u201cbetweenness\u201d of two individuals, individual and nature,\nor individual and trans-individual. \n",
