    "main_text": "The (Traditional) Epistemological Problem || The Argument from Analogy\n1.1 The Argument from Analogy\n\nWhile it may be the case that different considerations can give rise\nto an epistemological problem concerning other minds, on the whole\nwhat appears to have pre-occupied philosophers in the period under\nconsideration (mid-twentieth century) was the question of solipsism,\nthe question of whether I am alone in the universe. While it is often\naccepted that I cannot be certain that I am not alone, it is thought\nthat it can be shown that we have good reason to believe that the\nothers I encounter are like me in having thoughts and feelings. One\nform of reasoning has been taken to be \u201ctraditional\u201d in\nthis connection: the argument from analogy (Blackburn 1994).\nAnalogical reasoning cites similarities between two things and uses\nthis as support for concluding that further similarities may be taken\nto exist. Like all forms of inferential reasoning, analogical\nreasoning is employed in order to expand knowledge in the face of\nuncertainty (Bartha 2016).\n\nA statement of the argument from analogy can be found in the writing\nof J.S. Mill. In reply to the question,\n\n\nBy what evidence do I know, or by what considerations am I led to\nbelieve \u2026 that the walking and speaking figures which I see and\nhear, have sensations and thoughts, or in other words, possess\nMinds?\n\n\nMill writes:\n\n\nFirst, they have bodies like me, which I know in my own case, to be\nthe antecedent condition of feelings; and because, secondly, they\nexhibit the acts, and outward signs, which in my own case I know by\nexperience to be caused by feelings. (1865 [1872: 243])\n\n\nWhile this argument was once popular (see, e.g., Russell 1923;\nHampshire 1952), it soon came to be considered unfit for purpose due\nto the following considerations. Firstly, it was pointed out that\nwhile this way of proceeding may work in certain domains, in the case\nof other minds the conclusion is logically uncheckable (Locke 1968).\nSecondly, it was considered problematic that this way of extending\none\u2019s knowledge proceeds from a single case (Locke 1968). And\nthirdly, it was claimed that the very first premise of this argument\n(I know in my own case) is problematic (Malcolm 1958).\n\nVarious attempts have been made to salvage the argument. Against the\nfirst of these considerations it has been pointed out that we\nsuccessfully appeal to analogy when extending our knowledge from the\npresent to the past. However, Hyslop and Jackson (1972) remind us that\nthis defense fails to register the fact that the impossibility of\nchecking the conclusion in the case of other minds is logical\n(cf.\n \u00a71),\n and prefer to defend appeal to analogy here by suggesting that, while\nthis is true, it is not \u201cobviously relevant\u201d. They also\nsuggest that the fact that the conclusion here cannot be verified may\nbe \u201cneutralized\u201d by the fact that it also cannot be\nrefuted (1972: 169\u2013170).\n\nHyslop and Jackson also propose an alternative to the standard defense\nof the argument from analogy from the second of the above\nconsiderations. The standard defense insists that the argument does\nnot proceed from a single case and that there are innumerable\ninstances and many different contexts in which one observes a mental\nstate and its associated behavior (Ayer 1956: 219\u2013222); cf. Mill\nwho writes that analogy is an \u201cinferior degree of inductive\nevidence\u201d that only works by providing one with an hypothesis\nwhich is then verified by further correlations, 1865 [1872: 260]).\nAccording to Hyslop & Jackson, however, there is no need to appeal\nto multiple cases here just so long as one can establish a link\nbetween mental states and behavior, something they claim can be done\nfrom observation of one\u2019s own case (cf. Hill 1984). Hyslop\n(1995) warns that we must be careful here not to appeal to the\n(invalid) principle that like effects (behavior) have like causes\n(mental states)\u2014your behavior may have a purely physical cause.\nWe should instead appeal to the (valid) principle that like causes\nhave like effects: what I observe in my own case leads me to\nhypothesize that my mental states are caused by physical states of my\nbody, and I can argue that like physical states in others will cause\nlike mental states. This, in effect, is to invoke the principle of the\nUniformity of Nature; it is this principle that Hyslop believes lies\nat the heart of the argument from analogy. While many consider that\ngeneralization from a single instance is a crucial weakness in the\nargument from analogy, Hyslop takes this to be the argument\u2019s\nstrength. Indeed, he holds that the other main contender in the field,\nthe argument from scientific inference/best explanation fails\nprecisely because it does not take into account a crucial dependence\non our own case when it comes to knowledge of other minds (cf.\n \u00a71.2).\n\nThe third of the arguments that have been brought to bear against the\nargument from analogy requires careful consideration. The very premise\nthat Hyslop believes recommends this way of supporting one\u2019s\nbelief in other minds is the one that some have thought to be\nirremediably problematic. Malcolm, inspired by the later work of\nWittgenstein, has suggested that the premise\u2014I know from my own\ncase what it is like to think and feel\u2014is committed to what he\ncalls the \u201cfundamental error\u201d of thinking that one learns\nwhat thoughts and feelings are from one\u2019s own case (Malcolm\n1958: 974). This way of coming to learn about mind is associated with\nwhat is sometimes thought of as an \u2018inward glance\u2019 or\nintrospection (cf. Locke 1689). It has been argued that this way of\nlearning about mind or mental states is committed to the possibility\nof a private language (Wittgenstein 1953; Malcolm 1954). According to\nMalcolm, Wittgenstein advances both an \u201cinternal\u201d and an\n\u201cexternal\u201d attack on the possibility of such a language\n(Malcolm 1954 [1966: 75]). The internal attack aims to show that,\nwhile a genuine language requires that one be able to articulate\ncorrectness conditions for the application of a word, it is not\npossible to articulate such conditions when the referent of the word\nis not intersubjectively available. As Wittgenstein points out:\n\u201cWhatever is going to seem right to me is right. And that only\nmeans that here we can\u2019t talk about \u2018right\u2019\u201d\n(1953: \u00a7258). (For a statement of the \u201cexternal\u201d\nattack here see\n \u00a72.)\n The private language argument aside, the suggestion that I can come\nto know about mental states from my own case leads to a conception of\nmind as something not observable in behavior but as something lying\nbehind and causing behavior. Malcolm contrasts this way of thinking\nwith what he labels a criterial view of the relationship\nbetween mind and behavior. Much ink has been spilled over trying to\nunderstand this proposed alternative way of thinking of mind in\nrelation to behavior (see\n \u00a71.3).\n However we understand this proposal, it is important to appreciate\nthe difficulties thought to be associated with the idea that one\nlearns from one\u2019s own case what it is to think and feel: it is\nbelieved to lead inexorably to solipsism. (This was something arguably\nfirst appreciated by Thomas Reid; see\n \u00a74.1).\n It should, however, be noted that solipsism comes in two varieties:\nepistemological and conceptual. While the argument from analogy is\nproposed as a way of avoiding the former, it is arguable that it is\nreally the latter to which Malcolm and others are drawing our\nattention. In effect, the claim here is that use of the argument from\nanalogy as a way of avoiding epistemological solipsism (the only mind\nI can know is my own) falls foul of conceptual solipsism (the only\nmind I can think about is my own). Discussion of the conceptual\nproblem in connection with other minds may be thought to take us in a\ndirection at odds with that taken when one approaches these matters\nfrom an epistemological perspective (for the conceptual problem see\n \u00a72.)\n",
