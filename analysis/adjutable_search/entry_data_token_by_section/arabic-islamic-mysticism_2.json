    "main_text": "The \u201cPeriod of Philosophical Decline\u201d and the School of Shiraz\n3. The \u201cPeriod of Philosophical Decline\u201d and the School of Shiraz\n\nTraditionally, historians of philosophy have argued that after\nGhazz\u0101l\u012b in the 11th century CE, philosophical\nactivity in the Persian and Eastern part of the Islamic world was\neclipsed and shifted to Islamic Spain. There are those who attribute\nthis to Ghazz\u0101l\u012b\u2019s scathing attack on the\nphilosophers, but this is mostly a myth. The Islamic world at the time\nwas so large, and the intellectual milieu so rich and diverse, that no\nsingle book could put an end to its philosophy and discursive\nreasoning. While it is true that Peripatetic philosophy suffered a\ntemporary eclipse in Persia, the reason lies in the socio-political\nrealities of the Salj\u016bq dynasty and the Islamic world\u2019s\nstruggle with external forces like the Crusades. Recent\nscholarship,\u00a0such as that by Qasim Kaka'i in\nthe\u00a0Journal of Andishah-yi Dini,\u00a0has revealed that\nthe so called period of philosophical decline\u00a0was actually a\nthriving era of intellectual activity in the Southern part of Persia\nwhere the so called the \u201cSchool of Shiraz\u201d emerged. This\nSchool whose salient feature was to synthesis rationalism, mysticism,\nintellectual intuition and even popular Sufism was undoubtedly the\nprecursor to the School of Isfahan.\u00a0\n\nAmong the great masters of philosophical mysticism hailing from Spain,\nIbn Masarrah (883\u2013931 CE) stands out. He was an ascetic whose\nviews on the mystic quest for unity of the soul with God comprised a\nmajor theme in his philosophical mysticism. Others include Ibn\n\u1e24azm (994\u20131064), who emphasized mystical love,\nIbn-B\u0101jjah (1095\u20131138 CE) who treated the concept of\nintellectual and mystical intuition as the faculty that experiences\nDivine realities, Ibn Al-Sid of Badajoz (1052\u20131127 CE) who\ndeveloped what some have called mathematical mysticism, and\nIbn-\u1e6cufayl (c. 1105\u20131185 CE), whose mystical allegory\nSon of the Living Awake (\u1e24ayy ibn Yaqz\u0323\u0101n)\nand his concept of Active Intellect, made him a major exponent of\nmysticism in the Islamic philosophical tradition. Finally there is the\nSufi philosopher, Ibn Sab\u2018\u012bn (1217\u20131268 CE) who made\nan effort to bring about a rapprochement between philosophy and Sufism\nin a systematic treatment of mystical themes.\n\nDespite the significance of the above figures, none of them reached\nthe eminence of the greatest master of gnostic and philosophical\nSufism, Shaykh Mu\u1e25y\u012b al-D\u012bn Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\n(1165\u20131240 CE) often referred to Shaykh al-Akbar (The Great\nMaster). Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, whose encyclopedic works, The\nBezels of Wisdom (Fu\u1e63\u016b\u1e63 al-h\u0323akam)\nand Meccean Victories (Futu\u1e25\u0101t\nal-Makkiyah), provide us with one of the most complex mystical\nparadigms in the Islamic mystical genre. Often referred to as the\n\u201cDoctrine of the Unity of Being\u201d (wahdat\nal-w\u016bj\u016bd), Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\u2019s philosophical\nmysticism offers a vast synthesis of gnostic and Sufi ideas as well as\na type of philosophical discourse which, for the first time,\nformulates the Sufi doctrine. With Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, we see a\nmonumental effort to comment on a full array of metaphysical,\ncosmological, and psychological aspects of Gnosticism, thereby\nproviding a vision of reality whose attainment requires the practice\nof the Sufi path. Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b\u2019s philosophico-mystical\nedifice is a process of spiritual hermeneutics\n(ta\u2019w\u012bl) which relies on the language of symbolism\nto guide a novice from the exterior (\u1e93\u0101hir) to the\ninterior (b\u0101\u1e6din). For Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, the\nentire cosmos represents signs (ay\u0101t) which lend\nthemselves to symbolic exegesis, a process whose pinnacle is the\nUniversal Man (al-ins\u0101n al-k\u0101mil). Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b, whose doctrine of the Unity of Being\n(wa\u1e25dat al-w\u016bj\u016bd) has been interpreted by\nmany to be pantheism, was nevertheless careful to argue that even\nthough God dwells in things, but the world \u201cis not\u201d in\nGod. For Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, humans are microcosms and the universe\nis the macrocosm; the Universal Man is the one who realizes all of his\ninherent potentialities, including the Divine breath which was blown\ninto man by God in the beginning of creation as the Qur\u2019an says.\nFor Ibn \u2018Arab\u012b, it is the spiritual realization of God\nwithin the soul that leads to union with God (see Nasr 1964; Chittick\n1989 and 2007).\n\nIn the 12th century CE, during the so called \u201cperiod\nof decline\u201d of philosophical activities, the most notable figure\nwas the philosopher-mystic, Shaykh Shih\u0101b al-D\u012bn\nSuhraward\u012b, the founder of the School of Illumination\n(Ishr\u0101q). Suhraward\u012b, who was a Peripatetic, wrote\nfour major works, primarily in the Aristotelian tradition. He also\nwrote a number of works in a peculiar esoteric tradition, using what\nhe called \u201cthe language of illumination\u201d (lis\u0101n\nal-ishr\u0101q). In his illuminationist writings, Suhraward\u012b\nrelies on Neoplatonism but replaces such concepts as being and\nexistence with light and illumination, thus offering what can be\ncalled a gnostic-illuminationist version of Avicennian philosophy\n(Aminrazavi 2003). He offers his doctrine of illumination in his major\nwork, The Philosophy of Illumination (\u1e24ikmat\nal-ishr\u0101q).\n\nIn his Sufi writings, Suhraward\u012b employs both allegory and\ndidactic language to advise the novice how to follow the Sufi path,\noften with specific instructions regarding ascetic practices.\nPractical wisdom constitutes an inseparable component of the\nishr\u0101q\u012b doctrine, so much so that in the\nintroduction to his magnum opus, The Philosophy of\nIllumination, Suhraward\u012b warns the reader that the secrets\nof the book will remain hidden to the reader unless he fasts for forty\ndays and avoids consuming meat. Suhraward\u012b, similar to Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b, uses symbolism from nature and animals to offer a\nspiritual hermeneutic (ta\u2019w\u012bl) which begins with\ndiscursive philosophy but ends in gnosis and the spiritual return of\nman to his original abode.\n\nSuhraward\u012b is also credited with having advocated an\nepistemological theory known as \u201cknowledge by presence\u201d\n(\u2018ilm al-\u1e25u\u1e0dur\u012b), in which knowledge\nis attained directly and experientially when the knower, known, and\nthe epistemic relation become one and the same (Yazdi 1992).\nSuhraward\u012b\u2019s works on Sufism, most of which are written in\nPersian, include The Red Intellect (\u2018Aql-i\nsurkh), The Chant of Gabriel\u2019s Wing\n(\u0100waz-i par-i Jibr\u0101\u2019\u012bl), Story of\nthe Occidental Exile (Qi\u1e63\u1e63at al-ghurbat\nal-gharbiyyah), Language of the Termites (Lughat-i\nmur\u0101n), Treatise on the State of Childhood\n(Ris\u0101lah fi \u1e25\u0101lat al-\u1e6dufuliyyah), A\nDay Among the Sufis (Ruz\u012b b\u0101 jam\u0101\u2018at-i\n\u1e63ufiy\u0101n), The Sound of the Griffin\n(Safir-i simurg), Treatise of the Nocturnal Ascent\n(Ris\u0101lah fi\u2019l-mi\u2018r\u0101j), and Treatise\nof Illumination (Partaw-n\u0101mah) (Aminrazavi 1994).\n\nSuhraward\u012b\u2019s illuminationist philosophy has influenced many\nphilosophers who wrote major commentaries on gnostic and Sufi texts,\namong whom are Qutb al-D\u012bn Shir\u0101z\u012b (1236\u20131311\nCE), Mu\u1e25ammad Shahrazur\u012b (d. 1153 CE), and Ibn Turkah\nI\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b (c. 1362\u20131433 CE) Following\nSuhraward\u012b there is an even closer nexus between philosophy and\nmysticism. A number of rationalistic philosophers who adhered to Sufi\nideas and often practiced Sufism, became exponents of philosophical\nmysticism. The post Suhraward\u012ban philosopher-mystics, who\ncontinued to refine the rapprochement between philosophy and\nmysticism, have come to be known as the \u201cSchool of\nShir\u0101z.\u201d\n\nRecent scholarship, such as that by Qasim Kaka'i in\nthe\u00a0Journal of Andishah-yi Dini,\u00a0has revealed that\nwhat has traditionally been regarded as the period of decline of\nphilosophical activities in Persia was, after all, a very thriving\nperiod in philosophical activities in the Southern part of Persia.\nBetween 11th\u201316th century, Shiraz became\nthe center of Sufi and gnostic thought in Persia. Beginning with\nQu\u1e6db al-D\u012bn Shir\u0101z\u012b, who wrote a major commentary\non Suhraward\u012b\u2019s Philosophy of Illumination in\nattempt to clarify Suhraward\u012b\u2019s illuminative thought, the\nSchool of Shiraz produced a number of philosopher-Sufis. Qu\u1e6db\nal-Din Shir\u0101z\u012b\u2019s successor, M\u012br \u1e62adr\nal-D\u012bn Dashtak\u012b (1424 CE) dealt with the problem of\nexistence and the question of its principality. Jal\u0101l al-D\u012bn\nDaw\u0101n\u012b (1427 CE), another philosopher of this tradition,\nwrote on the exoteric subjects like law as well as esoteric matters.\nHis work on the relationship between Sufism, ethics, and\nilluminationist thought entitled Sparks of Illumination in the\nVirtues of Ethics (Law\u0101mi\u2018 al-ishr\u0101q f\u012b\nmak\u0101rim al-akhl\u0101q), also knows as Jalalian Ethics\n(Akhl\u0101q-\u012b Jal\u0101l\u012b ) is of particular\nimportance. This work is still used today by Sufi masters as a\npractical guide on how spiritual ethics can cleanse the soul.\nDaw\u0101n\u012b also wrote a number of commentaries on\nSuhraward\u012b\u2019s philosophy of illumination, such as Forms\nof Brightness Concerning the Temples of Light (Shaw\u0101kil\nal-\u1e25ur f\u012b shar\u1e25 hay\u0101kil al-n\u016br). The\nnext philosopher-mystic belonging to the School of Shir\u0101z is\nGhiy\u0101th al-D\u012bn Man\u1e63ur Dashtak\u012b (b.1461), the\noldest son of \u1e62adr al-D\u012bn Dashtak\u012b and the greatest\ngnostic philosopher of this period. Called a \u201cone man\nuniversity,\u201d he was well versed in law and jurisprudence as well\nas theoretical Sufism. Notable among his many works is his\nStations of Wisdom (Maq\u0101m\u0101t\nal-\u2018\u0101rif\u012bn), a profoundly gnostic work which came\nto symbolize the spirit of the School of Shir\u0101z. Dashtak\u012b\nhere presents a rich esoteric commentary on the verses of the\nQur\u2019an, the \u1e25adith and the sayings of such Sufi masters as\n\u1e24all\u0101j (858\u2013922 CE), R\u016bm\u012b (1207\u20131273\nCE), and \u1e24\u0101fiz (1320\u20131388 CE) among others, providing\nthe reader with an understanding of how the love of God can lead to\nthe transcendental unity of being. The influence of Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b is quite evident in this piece. Once again\nrapprochement between peripatetic philosophy,\nishr\u0101q\u012b doctrine, theology, and gnosticism\n(\u2018irf\u0101n) is made in order to help the seeker of\ntruth find his path through the maze of spiritual pitfalls.\n\nAmong other philosophers of this period not necessarily affiliated\nwith the School of Shir\u0101z, but interested in Sufism, are\nNa\u1e63\u012br al-D\u012bn \u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (1201\u20131274)\nwho wrote a work on Sufi ethics entitled Description of\nNobles (Aw\u1e63\u0101f al-ashr\u0101f), as well as\nAfd\u2019al al-D\u012bn K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b (d. 1213), a Sufi poet\nand philosopher. The latter was a strict Aristotelian who wrote\nextensive commentary on logic and other aspects of Aristotelian\nthought. While the majority of his fifty-two works are philosophical\nin nature, K\u0101sh\u0101n\u012b sees the task of philosophy to be\nthe facilitation of \u201cfollowing the path of God,\u201d as the\ntitle of one of his works suggests. His commentary on Ibn\n\u2018Arab\u012b, his references to other gnostics and Sufis, and his\nmystical poetry, have identified him more as a Sufi than a\nrationalistic philosopher. Writing quatrains in the style of Omar\nKhayyam (1048\u20131131), it is in his poetry that Sufism is most\napparent. In a quatrain he says,\n\nO pure Sufi seeking God,\n\nHe has no place, from where do you seek him\n\nIf you do know Him, why do you seek Him?\n\nIf you don\u2019t know Him, whom are you seeking? (Chittick 2001)\n\n\nMoving from Persia to India, in the 11th century CE., when\nthe Persian dynasty of Ghaznavids began to rule in India,\nphilosophical mysticism and the practice of Sufism became popular\namong the Indian Muslim philosophers. Among the central figures of\nthis movement are Shaykh Yousef Gardi\u012b Mult\u0101n\u012b, Shaykh\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl Lahor\u012b, Im\u0101m \u1e24asan\nSan\u2018\u0101n\u012b, and Shaykh Abu\u2019l-\u1e24asan\n\u2018Al\u012b Hujwa\u012br\u012b, the philosopher-Sufi and the\nauthor of Unveiling of the Veiled (Kashf\nal-ma\u1e25j\u016bb). At that time, the\nIsm\u0101\u2018\u012bl\u012b missionaries, who had spread the gnostic\ninterpretation of Islam in India had already created a receptive\nintellectual milieu for the Sufi and gnostic ideas. By the\n14th century CE., due to the migration of Persian\nphilosophers and their students to northern India, the more mystically\noriented philosophy of the above figures gained popularity in India as\nwell.\n\nWithin the next two centuries, despite the rise and fall of several\ndynasties, the patronage of philosophers in India in general did not\nchange. Sufi patronage reached a new high during the Mongol period,\nwhose rulers were particularly keen in the Sufi tradition in all its\nmanifestations; especially philosophy, poetry and the visual arts.\nSuch notable Persian philosophers as Taftaz\u0101n\u012b (c.\n1322\u20131390 CE) and Jurj\u0101n\u012b (1097\u20131127 CE) went to\nIndia at this time. They were followed by such figures as M\u012br\nFat\u1e25 All\u0101h Shir\u0101z\u012b, who reformed the educational\ncurriculums to emphasize the teachings of the mystical philosophies of\nhis Persian teachers.\n\nPhilosophical mysticism continued in the Islamic philosophical\ntradition of northern India in figures such as Kh\u0101wjah\nMu\u1e25ammad Baq\u012b bi\u2019ll\u0101h (b.1563), a celebrated\nmystic and the founder of Naqshband\u012b Sufi order, as well as in\nhis student Shaykh A\u1e25mad Sirhind\u012b (1564\u20131624), the\nproponent of the doctrine of \u201cThe Unity of Consciousness\u201d\n(wa\u1e25dat al-shuh\u016bd) and the author of\nEpistoles (Maktub\u0101t). Other Muslim philosophers\nfrom the Indo-Pakistani continent who incorporated mysticism were\nMull\u0101 \u2018Abd al-\u1e24ak\u012bm Siyalkot\u012b, Mull\u0101\nMa\u1e25m\u016bd Junpur\u012b Faruq\u012b, and M\u012brz\u0101\nMu\u1e25ammad Z\u0101hid Haraw\u012b (1603\u20131652), who became\nthe proponent of Suhraward\u012b\u2019s illuminationist philosophy;\nand, perhaps the most well known philosopher-mystic, Sh\u0101h\nWaliull\u0101h, who lived in the 18th century CE.\nWaliull\u0101h made an attempt to reconcile\nIbn-\u2018Arab\u012b\u2019s doctrine of \u201cThe Unity of\nBeing\u201d (wa\u1e25dat al-w\u016bj\u016bd) and\nSirhind\u012b\u2019s doctrine of \u201cThe Unity of\nConsciousness\u201d (wa\u1e25dat al-shuh\u016bd). In\naddition to his numerous writings on the foundation of Sufi\nmetaphysics, Sh\u0101h Waliull\u0101h should be given credit for\nbringing legitimacy to mystical doctrine despite the attacks of\northodox jurists who saw Sufism as heretical.\n",
