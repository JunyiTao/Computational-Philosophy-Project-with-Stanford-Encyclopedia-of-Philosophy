    "main_text": "Why The Family is Subject to Principles of Justice || The family constrains or enables women's freedoms\n1.3 The family constrains or enables women's freedoms\n\n\nDespite the advances prompted by the feminist movement during the last\nquarter of the twentieth century, most families are based on an\nunequal division of labor. Around the globe, women still do the vast\nmajority of domestic labor \u2014 not only tending the house, but\nalso raising and caring for children. Feminist scholars have attacked\ntraditional approaches to the family that obscure this inequality. For\nexample, they have criticized the dominant economic approaches to the\nfamily that regard the head of the household as an altruistic agent of\nthe interests of all the family's members (See Becker 1981 for such\nan approach). They have shown that, in poor countries, when\ndevelopment aid is given to male rather than female heads of\nhousehold, less of it goes to care for children (Haddad et\nal. 1997).\n\n\nFeminist economists and sociologists have also shown how women's role\nin parenting constrains their ability to pursue careers and compete\nfor demanding jobs (Bergmann 1986, Folbre 1994). Many women\ntherefore remain economically dependent on their male partners, and\nvulnerable to poverty in the event of divorce. In one widely cited\nstudy, ex-husbands' standard of living was found to have risen by 42%\nthe year after their divorce, while ex-wives' standard of living was\nreduced by 78% (Weitzman 1985). This huge discrepancy in income and\nwealth results from a number of factors, including the fact that women\nwho have devoted themselves to raising children usually have lower job\nqualifications than their husbands and less work experience.\n\n\nWomen's economic dependency in turn allows them to be subject to\nphysical, sexual or psychological abuse by their husbands or other male\npartners (Gordon, 1988; Global Fund for Women Report, 1992). Women have\nan asymmetric ability to exit from marriage; and this gives\nhusbands/male partners considerably more power and bargaining advantage\nwithin the marriage (Sen 1989).\n\n\nDefenders of the status quo often argue that if women have less\nopportunity than men, this is largely due to their own choices.\nFeminists have countered this claim by showing the ways that such\nchoices are shaped and constrained by forces that are themselves\nobjectionable and not freely chosen. Some feminists follow Nancy\nChodorow's argument (1978) that the fact that children's primary\nnurturers are mothers leads to a sexually differentiated developmental\npath for boys and girls. Girls identify with the same-sex nurturing\nparent, and feel more connected to others; boys, by identifying with\nthe absent parent, feel themselves to be more\n\u201cindividuated\u201d. Chodorow argues that mothering is thereby\nreproduced across generations by a largely unconscious\nmechanism that, in turn, perpetuates the inequality of women at home\nand at work.\n\n\nChodorow's work is controversial, but it is undeniable that girls\nand boys grow up facing different expectations of how they will behave.\nChildren receive strong cultural messages \u2014 from parents, teachers,\npeers and the media \u2014 about sex-appropriate traits and behaviors. Girls\nare supposed to be nurturing, self-sacrificing, non-aggressive and\nattractive; \u201ccare\u201d is largely seen as a feminine\ncharacteristic. These traits traditionally contribute to women's\ninequality: nurturers are not seen as good leaders. There are few women\nCEOs, generals, or political leaders. Girls may also become\ndisadvantaged by the anticipation of marriage and child-rearing,\ninsofar as they are less likely than boys to invest in their human\n\u201ccapital\u201d.\n\n\nA second feminist response stresses the ways that women's choices in\nthe family interact with unjust social structures outside the\nfamily, in particular, with the sex segregated division of labor in\nthe economy, where women still earn only about 75% of what men earn,\nfor comparable work. Given women's lower wages, it is rational for\nfamilies who must provide their own childcare to choose to withdraw\nwomen from the workforce. Once women withdraw, they find themselves\nfalling further behind their male counterparts in skill development\nand earning power. Child care is an immensely time consuming activity\nand those who do it single-handedly are unlikely to be able to pursue\nother goods such as education, political office or demanding\ncareers. The structures of work and family thus form a \u201ccycle of\nvulnerability\u201d that conditions the lives and choices of women\n(Okin 1989). Even those who do somehow manage to combine work and\nfamily, face serious obstacles including the lack of good quality\nsubsidized day care; jobs with little flexibility for those who need\nto care for a sick child; school schedules that seem to be premised on\nhaving a parent at home; and the expectation that they will continue\nto work a \u201csecond shift\u201d, (Hochschild 1989) assuming the\nresponsibility for the bulk of household labor. Statistical analysis\nshows that motherhood tends to lower a woman's earnings, even if she\ndoes not take any time off from paid work (Folbre 1994). Gender\ninequality persists in access to positions in economy and government\nwhere white males are about 40% of population but 95% of senior\nmanagers, 90% of newspaper editors, and 80% of congressional\nlegislators (Rhode 1997).  And although women have made progress in\nentering elite positions in the economy and government, there is\nevidence that such progress has now stalled (Correll 2004).\n\n\nFeminists share the view that contemporary families are not only\nrealms of choice but also realms of constraint. Feminists also agree\nthat the gender hierarchy in our society is unjust, although they\ndiffer on what they take its sources to be. Some feminists emphasize\nthe family as the \u201clinchpin\u201d of gender injustice (Okin\n1989); while others see the main causes in the structure of work and\nopportunity (Bergmann 1986); still others stress sexual domination and\nviolence (MacKinnon 1989). All of these strands seem important\ncontributors to gender inequality, and it is doubtful that any one can\nbe fully reduced to the others. It is therefore important to deepen\nour understanding of the interplay of these different sources of\nsubordination. There is clearly what Okin (1989) termed a \u201ccycle\nof vulnerability\u201d through which women's unequal position in the\nhome interacts with women's unequal position in the workplace.  For\nexample, because women tend to earn less than men, if someone has to\ntake time off to raise the kids, it makes economic sense for it to be\nthe female lower earner. Gender also undoubtedly interacts with other\naxes of social disadvantage, such as race and class. Indeed, feminist\nwork on families has increasingly recognized the diverse experiences\nof women in families that encompass not only heterosexual two parent\nfamilies, but also single women, lesbian and gay families, and\nfamilies in poverty. We need to be careful not to lump together\ndistinct social phenomena. Although I will sometimes refer to\n\u201cthe family\u201d in this essay, it is crucial to keep in mind\nthe diversity of family forms and circumstances.\n\n\nWhether families are the primary cause, or a contributing cause\nalong with other social structures and culturally generated\nexpectations, feminists point to the ways that families are\npart of a system that reproduces women's social and economic\ninequality. Families cannot be viewed apart from that system or in\nisolation from it. Nor can they be assumed to be just: too many of them\nare not. The issue, for feminists, is not whether the state can\nintervene in the family and reproduction but how, and to what ends.\n",
