    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || Church\u2019s Paradox\n2.6 Church\u2019s Paradox\n\nThe following paradox\u2014perhaps the ultimate paradox of\nidentity\u2014derives from an argument of Church (1982). Suppose\nPierre thinks that London and Londres are different cities, but of\ncourse doesn\u2019t think that London is different from London, or\nthat Londres is different from Londres. Assuming that proper names\nlack Fregean senses, we can apply LL to get the result that London and\nLondres are distinct. We have here an argument that, given\nthe standard account of identity, merely thinking that \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are distinct is enough to make them so. There are, of\ncourse, a number of ways around this conclusion without abandoning the\nstandard account of identity. Church himself saw the argument (his\nversion of it) as demonstrating the inadequacy of Russellian\nintensional logic\u2014in which variables and constants operate as\nthey do in extensional logic, i.e., unequipped with senses. (For\nanother reaction, see Salmon 1986.) But there are strong arguments\nagainst the view that names (or variables) have senses (Kripke 1980).\nIn light of these arguments, Church\u2019s argument may be viewed as\nposing yet another paradox of identity.\n\nThe general form of Church\u2019s argument has been exploited by\nothers to reach further puzzling conclusions. For example, it has been\nused to show that there can be no such thing as vague or\n\u201cindeterminate\u201d identity (Evans 1978; and for discussion,\nParsons 2000). For \\(x\\) is not vaguely identical to \\(x\\); hence, if\n\\(x\\) is assumed to be vaguely identical to \\(y\\), then by LL, \\(x\\)\nand \\(y\\) are (absolutely) distinct. As it stands, Evans\u2019\nargument shows at best that vaguely identical objects must be\nabsolutely distinct, not that there is no such thing as vague\nidentity. But some have tried to amend the argument to get\nEvans\u2019 conclusion (Parsons 2000; and see the entry on\nvagueness). In any case, it is useful to see the connection between\nEvans\u2019 argument and Church\u2019s. If, for example,\n\u201cvaguely identical\u201d is taken to mean \u201cthought to be\nidentical\u201d, then the two arguments collapse into one another.\nChurch\u2019s line of argument would seem to lead ultimately to the\nextreme antirealist position that any perceived difference among\nobjects is a real difference. If one resolves not to attempt to escape\nthe clutches of LL by some clever dodge\u2014by disallowing\nstraightforward quantifying-in, for example, as with the doctrine of\nAbelardian predicates\u2014one comes quickly to the absurd conclusion\nthat no statement of the form \\(x = y\\), where the terms are\ndifferent, or are just different tokens of the same type, can be true.\nYet it might just be that the fault lies not in ourselves, but in\nLL.\n",
