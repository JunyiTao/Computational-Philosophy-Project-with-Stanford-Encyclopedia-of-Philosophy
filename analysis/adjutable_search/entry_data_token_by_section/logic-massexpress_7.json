    "main_text": "Quantifiers\n6. Quantifiers\n\n\nWhat is the semantics of quantifiers combining with mass nouns:\nsome, all, no, only, little, much, most, two liters\nof\u2026? Higginbotham and May (1981) propose that the semantics\nof quantifiers combining with count nouns (some, all, no, only,\nfew, many, most, two\u2026) can be captured within the framework\nof generalized quantification. Inspired by Roeper (1983) and\nL\u00f8nning (1987), Higginbotham (1994) applies similar ideas to the\ncase of mass nouns. His proposals are made in the Boolean approach\ncriticized in the last section. So we transpose them directly into the\nmixed set-theoretic and mereological framework. This also has the\nadvantage that the same framework is used for count quantifiers and\nmass quantifiers.\n\n\nWe consider sentences of the form Q M P, where Q\nis a quantifier, M a mass noun and P a predicate.\n[M] is the denotation of the mass noun, i.e., the set that has\nfor members everything that is M (a join semi-lattice). [P] is\nthe set that has for members everything that P. Using set-theoretic intersection \u2229, one may propose:\n\nSome M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] \u2260 \u2205\nAll M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] =\n[M][16]\nNo M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] =\n\u2205\nOnly M P is true iff [M] \u2229 [P] =\n[P]\n\nThis applies to sentences like Some / All / No / Only gold was\nstolen.\n\n\nWith the other quantifiers (little, much,\nmost, two liters of\u2026), one seems to say\nsomething about the quantity of M (little gold) or intensity\nof M (little wisdom). Let us suppose that a mass noun\nM has an associated function, \u03bc, that measures quantity or\nintensity. We focus here on mass nouns that apply to concrete entities,\nlike water or furniture (see section 10 for\n\u201cabstract\u201d mass nouns). In that case, it is handy (though\nperhaps not necessary) to suppose that \u03bc is monotonic:\n\nx \u2264 y \u2192 \u03bc(x) \u2264 \u03bc(y)\n\nand additive (if x and y don\u2019t overlap, the measure of their sum is\nthe sum of their measures):\n\n\u00ac\u2203z (z \u2264 x & z \u2264 y) \u2192\n \u03bc(x\u2228y) =\n\u03bc(x) + \u03bc(y)\n\n(The measure function \u03bc is associated to a certain mass noun\nM. But of course, some mass nouns may share the same measure\nfunction. And with a single mass noun M, different measure\nfunctions may perhaps be used, in different contexts, to measure the\n\u201cquantity of M\u201d that is relevant in the context.)\n\n\nOne can also define the measure of a set E:\n\n\u03bc(E) =def \u03bc(\u2228E),\n\nwhere \u2228E is the sum (or join) of the elements of E.\n\n\nWith this in hand, the meanings of little, much\nand most can be specified as follows, the numerical values\np, q, r and s being specified\ncontextually when a sentence is uttered:\n\nLittle1 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2264 p\nLittle2 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2264 r*\u03bc([M])\nMuch1 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2265 q\nMuch2 M P is true iff \u03bc([M]\n\u2229 [P]) \u2265 s*\u03bc([M])\nMost M P is true iff \u03bc([M] \u2229 [P])\n\u2265 \u03bc([M]) / 2\nTwo liters of M P is true iff \u03bc([M] \u2229\n[P]) = 2\nwith a function \u03bc measuring in liters\n\nAbove, little and much are given two meanings, an\n\u201cabsolute\u201d one and a \u201cproportional\u201d one. Thus,\na sentence like Much gold was stolen may mean that:\n\n\nThe stolen gold was a large quantity of gold (absolute\ninterpretation):\n\u03bc([M] \u2229 [P]) \u2265 q, where q is specified contextually.\n\n\nThe stolen gold was a great proportion of the gold\n(proportional\n interpretation):[17]\n\u03bc([M] \u2229 [P]) \u2265 s*\u03bc([M]), where s is specified contextually.\n\n\nRemark 1: What precedes allows one to characterize\nthe meaning(s) of the various mass quantifiers. But of course, it\nleaves room for improvement concerning the specific meanings\nattributed. For instance, Solt (2009) argues in favor of a different\ncondition for the quantifier\nmost.\nRemark 2: In the case of the count quantifiers few and\nmany, there is evidence that each quantifier is really\nambiguous between two interpretations, the absolute one and the\nproportional one (Partee 1989). It remains to be seen whether there is\nsimilar evidence in the case of little and much.\nRemark 3: Adding negation to this picture creates the same\ndifficulties as we saw above in the case of definites. In certain\ncases, [not P] can be defined in terms of [P] and\nnon-overlap. But in general, [P] and [not P] should\nbe separately specified.\n",
