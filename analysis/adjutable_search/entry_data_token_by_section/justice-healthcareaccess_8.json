One such lesson is that\nrationales for universal access derive from more general\nconsiderations of justice. As such, they borrow their justificatory\nforce from the arguments for those general considerations. They also\nbring with them from those general theories specific considerations\nthat may affect the content of the claim to universal access. Thus, a\nfamily of egalitarian theories that talk about equality of opportunity\nin different ways might thus all support universal access to health\ncare because of its impact on opportunity, but they justify different\nkinds of access because they view the obligation to promote\nopportunity in somewhat different ways.\n\nA second lesson is that some rationales depend on highly idealized\nassumptions and might provide less clarity about the design of benefit\npackages than might be hoped. For example, the arguments from\nprudential insurance\u2014despite their different ethical\npresuppositions\u2014give less guidance to institutional design and\ndesign of a benefit package than might have been hoped since they\npresuppose extrapolating from consumer behavior in a truly competitive\nand ideally informed insurance market. Similarly, both lines of\nargument make it impossible to be specific about what prudent\ninsurance would include because we do not know what level of\npurchasing is possible at either the \u201cequal resources\u201d or\n\u201cdecent economic minimum\u201d that the two views posit. In\ncontrast, the deliberative fair process that supplements the fair\nequality of opportunity account does not require such a hypothetical\ncontext to yield results.\n\nA third lesson is that avoiding a unifying theoretical account of\nuniversal access to care may cost more than it gains. Specifically,\neschewing appeal to a background theory that justifies health care\nbecause it contributes to something else of importance to social\njustice (fair equality of opportunity, treating people as equals), and\nappealing instead to a pluralism of considerations, risks losing\nclarity about what care is part of the \u201cdecent minimum\u201d it\npurports to provide legal entitlements to.\n\nIn the next two sections, we shall focus in more detail on what the\nfair equality of opportunity account says we owe each other and its\nimplications for a right to health care. We adopt this focus because\nin contrast to the other views surveyed, it is more explicit about the\ncontent of the health care we owe to each other. We shall note the\nimplications of other views where feasible.\n",
