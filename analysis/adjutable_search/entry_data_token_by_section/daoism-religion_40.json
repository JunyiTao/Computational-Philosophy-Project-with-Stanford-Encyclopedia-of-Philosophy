    "main_text": "Meditation || \u201cPacing the Celestial Net\u201d\n9.3 \u201cPacing the Celestial Net\u201d\n\nShangqing Daoism also developed meditation practices that take adepts\nto the extremities of the cosmos or to the Sun, the Moon, and other\nastral bodies (Robinet 1993: 171\u201385 and 187\u2013230). For some\nof their features, these practices are related to the\n\u201cfar roaming\u201d described in pre-Han and Han literary works\n(see\n \u00a72.2).\n The Dipper, in particular, is the heavenly residence of the Great One\n(Taiyi); it is made of nine stars, two of which are said to be visible\nonly by advanced adepts. One of the nine stars, called Heavenly Pass\n(tianguan), allows the adept to exit the cosmos and access\nthe domains placed above and beyond it. The meditative walk on the\nstars was called Pacing the Celestial Net (bugang). It\nincorporated the ancient ritual practice of the Steps of Yu\n(yubu), which imitated the lamely way of walking of the\nmythical Emperor Yu, but also included cosmological and numerological\nelements (Andersen 1989\u201390).\n",
