Aristotle\u2019s Logical Works: The Organon\n\nThe ancient commentators grouped together several of Aristotle\u2019s\ntreatises under the title Organon (\u201cInstrument\u201d)\nand regarded them as comprising his logical works:\n\nCategories\nOn Interpretation\nPrior Analytics\nPosterior Analytics\nTopics\nOn Sophistical Refutations\n\n\nIn fact, the title Organon reflects a much later controversy\nabout whether logic is a part of philosophy (as the Stoics maintained)\nor merely a tool used by philosophy (as the later Peripatetics\nthought); calling the logical works \u201cThe Instrument\u201d is a\nway of taking sides on this point. Aristotle himself never uses this\nterm, nor does he give much indication that these particular treatises\nform some kind of group, though there are frequent cross-references\nbetween the Topics and the Analytics. On the other\nhand, Aristotle treats the Prior and Posterior\nAnalytics as one work, and On Sophistical Refutations is\na final section, or an appendix, to the Topics). To these\nworks should be added the Rhetoric, which explicitly declares\nits reliance on the Topics.\n",
