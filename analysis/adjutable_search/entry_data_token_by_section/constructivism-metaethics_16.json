    "main_text": "The Euthyphro Question || Constructivism and Congruence with Intuitions\n7.1 Constructivism and Congruence with Intuitions\n\nConsider the first objection that constructivism relies on an\n\u201cunconstructed\u201d, hence unjustified \u2013 set of\nnormative constraints on theorizing (Hare 1983). For instance, Kantian\nconstructivism appears to be grounded on the value of moral\nimpartiality, which demands equal respect for persons (Scanlon 1998:\n22\u201333; 287\u2013290; Rawls 1993: 38\u201354). The worry is\nthat, in the final analysis, constructivism is vacuous because\n\u201cits test yields results only by presupposing moral views which\ncan only be established independently of it\u201d (Raz 2003: 358;\nTimmons 2003; Cohen 2003; Brink 1987, 1989; Hare 1983). Furthermore,\nthere is \n\n\nno non-question-begging feature to which the constructivist can help\nherself in breaking symmetry among the various competing sets of\nconstructed principles. (Timmons 2003: \u00a73)\n\n\nKant is keenly aware of the air of paradox surrounding the claim that\nthe moral concepts, such as good and evil, are not determined prior to\nengaging in practical reasoning, but only as a result of engaging in\npractical reasoning. This is known as the \u2018paradox of the\nmethod\u2019 (Kant C2, 5: 62 ff.) As Rawls explains it, \n\n\nThe difficulty is that Kant appears to know in advance of critical\nreflection how a constructivist doctrine might look, but this makes it\nimpossible to undertake such reflection in good faith. In reply to\nthis quite proper worry, we interpret constructivism as a view about\nhow the structure and content of the soundest moral doctrine would\nlook once it is laid out after due critical reflection. (Rawls 2000:\n274) \n\n\nPractical reasoning does not serve the purpose of discovering an order\nof values independent of its verdicts. Nonetheless, for Kantian\nconstructivists there is some sort of practical knowledge, which\ndisplays a self-conscious character, can only be accommodated by\naccounts that represent the operation of the cognitive capacity as\nself-conscious activity (Rawls 2000: 148, see also 218; Engstrom 2013;\nBagnoli 2013b; Jezzi 2016: \u00a75). From this perspective, the\nnovelty of constructivism consists in providing an account of\nobjective practical knowledge that does not presuppose an independent\nmoral reality to which the mind must conform, but accounts for such\nreality in terms of the cognitive activity of reason.\n\nConstructivists and their critics disagree about the role to accord to\nintuitions in rational justification. According to Scanlon, a valid\nmethod of justification in ethics consists in testing the congruence\nbetween theoretical assumptions and intuitive moral judgments, that\nis, judgments to which we normally accord initial credence. It is\ndoubtful that we could avoid all appeal to intuitions as unpromising\n(Scanlon 1998: 241\u2013247). However, the intuitions on which\nconstructivism relies are not independent moral truths and do not\nserve as an external foundation for morality (Rawls 2000: 178, 273).\nNot all constructivists view intuitions as playing a role in rational\njustification (O\u2019Neill 1989b). But all agree that an adequate\nmetaethics should not be totally revisionary; rather, it should be\ncongruent with common understandings of rationality and morality\n(Smith 2013: 313). Arguably, this commitment sets constructivism apart\nfrom those kinds of projectivist and error theories (Blackburn 1993;\nMackie 1977, which claim that evaluative discourse involves a\nsystematic error (Bagnoli 2002; Street 2010; Lillehammer 2011.\n",
