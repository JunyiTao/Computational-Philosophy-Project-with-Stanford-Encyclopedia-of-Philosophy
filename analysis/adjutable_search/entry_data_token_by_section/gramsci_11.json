    "main_text": "Prison Writings || State and Civil Society\n3.2 State and Civil Society\n\nGramsci\u2019s discussion of hegemony hinged, in part, on the\nempirical observation that capitalist rule in developed western\nstates, increasingly, is founded on the generation of consent across\ncivil society, not solely on the deployment of coercion via the army,\npolice or law courts.\n\nExpanding on his suggestion from 1926 (see\n \u00a72.3\n above) that the ruling class had available to it \u201cpolitical and\norganizational reserves\u201d, Gramsci now argued that modern states\nsince the mid-nineteenth century have tended to cultivate consensual\nsupport\u2014or hegemony\u2014across civil society such that\ncoercion, or its threat, was no longer the primary form of rule,\nexcept in \u201cmoments of crisis of command and direction when\nspontaneous consent has failed\u201d (SPN: 220\u201321).\n\nGramsci drew on a distinction, common in Italian political thought,\nbetween \u201cforce\u201d and \u201cconsent\u201d. Hegemony\nreferred to consent, although this was understood usually to be\nbalanced with force. Modern states aimed to absorb threats to their\npower by winning over potentially hostile social groups and classes,\ncompromising the immediate interests of the dominant class to maintain\ngeneral support. Such efforts may often be fragile or limited, but\nthat basic condition fundamentally altered the terrain of political\ncontest. States could not be reduced to mere administrative units of\nexecutive authority\u2014that is, to a separate \u201cpolitical\nsociety\u201d\u2014but were intertwined with a \u201csturdy\nstructure of civil society\u201d\u2014schools, churches,\n\u201cprivate associations\u201d, newspapers, intellectuals and so\non (SPN: 238). Unlike in Russia\u2014where state power was strong and\ncivil society weak (\u201cprimordial and\ngelatinous\u201d)\u2014modern states utilize the\n\u201ctrenches\u201d of civil society by exercising \u201ccivil\nhegemony\u201d (SPN: 243). This protected them from the threats to\ntheir rule caused by economic crises or civil disruption.\n\nThe state, then, was a complex structure combining both force and\nconsent: it was both the instrument by which a ruling class maintained\nits dominance over society and the medium through which it\nundertook a \u201ccivilising activity\u201d, functioning as an\n\u201cethical state\u201d or \u201ceducator\u201d by promoting\n\u201ca certain way of life\u201d for its citizens (SPN: 247; see\nalso SPN: 12). At one point Gramsci formulated this as \u201cState =\npolitical society + civil society (in other words hegemony protected\nby the armour of coercion)\u201d, or what he also called an\n\u201cintegral\u201d conception of the state.\n\nGramsci\u2019s remarks elaborated his earlier rejection of an\nexclusively insurrectionary model of revolution. In the\nNotebooks he was further suggesting that hegemony described a\ngeneral condition applicable to both bourgeois and proletarian forms\nof rule. Revolutionary transformation\u2014for any\nclass\u2014cannot be focused exclusively on the seizure of coercive\nand bureaucratic power but must engage the state\u2019s wider system\nof defenses. He referred to this in the military terms that had become\ncommonplace after the First World War as a switch from a \u201cwar of\nmanoeuvre\u201d\u2014a direct and violent assault on the forces of\nthe state\u2014to a \u201cwar of position\u201d\u2014the gradual\nwinning of tactical strongholds (SPN: 238\u201339). A revolutionary\nproject, he suggested, must first build consent across civil society\nbefore taking formal power (SPN: 57). That did not mean that\ncoercion would never be necessary, only that its status was\ndiminished in modern states.\n\nUnderstanding variations in the exercise of hegemony required a\npolitical analysis attuned to the \u201cequilibrium\u201d of force\nand consent at any conjuncture. In place of the common Marxist\ndivision of economic \u201cstructure\u201d and\n\u201csuperstructure\u201d, Gramsci proposed the concept of a\n\u201chistorical bloc\u201d (blocco storico). This was a\ncomposite of distinct class and social forces joined politically and\nculturally under a specific form of hegemony (SPN: 137). Additionally,\nit was possible to gauge the extent to which a class had sacrificed\nits \u201ceconomic corporate\u201d interests in expanding its\nleadership across civil society (SPN: 161). Empirical analysis of\nhegemony would assess the \u201crelations of forces\u201d that\ncombined structures and superstructures in a historical situation\n(SPN: 181\u201385; for a discussion, see Bellamy & Schecter 1993:\nch. 6).\n\nGramsci explored various historical examples and concepts of political\nrule in the Notebooks. In extensive notes on the Italian\nRisorgimento (the period of state building in the nineteenth century)\nhe highlighted the failure of the northern bourgeoisie to develop an\nextensive hegemonic leadership by incorporating\n\u201csubaltern\u201d social classes in the South (see SPN:\n52\u2013120). He borrowed the concept of \u201cpassive\nrevolution\u201d to describe this situation in which a change in\neconomic structure occurs but without a radical political\ntransformation; this was a concept he also suggested could describe\nFascism (SPN: 105\u201320).\n",
