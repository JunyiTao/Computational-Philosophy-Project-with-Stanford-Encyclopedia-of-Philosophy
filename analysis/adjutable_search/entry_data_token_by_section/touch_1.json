    "main_text": "Is Touch Multisensory?\n2. Is Touch Multisensory?\nTouch is often classified as one of the traditional five senses,\nalong with sight, hearing, smell, and taste. Touch is, in several\nways, seemingly different from these other senses, however. For one\nthing, touch does not seem to have a single sense organ. The skin, of\ncourse, is the most plausible candidate sensory organ, but the skin\nitself is not sensory. Instead, the skin contains many different\nsensory systems. Many of them, like those that code for pain and itch,\ndo not seem to be tied directly to the sense of touch. For instance,\nwe don\u2019t, at least in most contexts, seem to treat cutaneous\npains as part of the sense of touch proper. The same seems\ntrue for itch, tingles, and twinges, though perhaps these seem more\nclosely tied with touch. At any rate, they are not paradigm instances\nof tactual perception, and if they seem more closely tied to touch,\nthen this is something in need of explanation.\nEven if we focus only on those systems usually associated with\ntouch, we find a number of distinct sensory channels. Some of these\nhave proven incredibly difficult to isolate and study (see e.g., the\nhistorical discussion in Gallace and Spence 2014). Indeed, we are just\nnow starting to understand the role and function of the most basic\nreceptor types involved in touch. Another methodological challenge, to\nwhich we\u2019ll return, concerns the deep connection between touch\nand exploratory action (nicely summarized in Jones and Lederman\n2006). For touch, many of the historically important empirical\ninvestigations have focused on cutaneous touch, especially on mapping\nthe two\u2013point threshold over the extent of the body. This\nthreshold is the minimal distance at which a subject can discriminate\ntwo distinct stimuli. Its study requires subjects to remain completely\nstill, while very small probes (like horse hair) are used to generate\nstimuli. It is much more difficult to measure touch in ecologically\nsalient contexts where there are unconstrained movements using the\nwhole body.\nThis raises some interesting questions about what counts as the\nsense of touch. There have been various attempts to define touch. One\nattempt concludes that the typical means of unifying the systems\ninvolved in touch fail to give anything like a coherent account. The\nconclusion is that:\n[T]his leaves us with something so heterogeneous\n that no criteria can unite its various characteristics and at the\n same time exclude characteristics of other senses. \n (Ratcliffe 2012: 3)\nThese discussions reveal the depth and difficulty of the\nproblem. Here are some reasons why the issue is so difficult. At the\nphysiological level, the afferent nerve channels that carry\ninformation about thermal properties are very similar to those that\ncode for pain and itch, and they also differ significantly from those\ninvolved in the coding of pressure, shape, and vibration (for some\nempirical background, see Lumpkin and Caterina (2007); for important\nrecent caveats, see Saal and Bensmaia (2014)). In other words, thermal\nchannels are physiologically and functionally more similar to the\nnociceptive channels involved in pain than they are to the channels involved in\ndiscriminative touch (Schepers and Ringkamp 2010). And yet thermal\nawareness is often considered part of touch, indeed, it has often been\nthought of as one of the central aspects of touch. Pains, on the other\nhand, are almost never considered part of touch.\nIsolating touch on physiological and functional grounds is thus\ndifficult. In addition, there is the problem that haptic touch\ninvolves many essential receptors that are located in the muscles,\njoints, and tendons, and not in the skin at all. Since these receptors are\nalmost always thought to be involved in coding for touch, there is the\nadditional problem that even the rich set of receptors in the skin are\nnot the only ones involved in typical touch experiences.\nGiven these facts, touch cannot be associated solely with the skin\nin any simplistic way. The skin contains a heterogeneous set of\ndistinct receptor populations, and these populations differ in their\nphysiological and functional properties. In addition, our ways of\nclassifying elements as part of touch don\u2019t seem sensitive to\nany of these differences in obvious ways. It thus seems clear that the\nsense of touch isn\u2019t simply that form of perceptual awareness\nconstituted by signals made available through the receptors in our\nskin.\nPerhaps because of this functional physiological diversity, the\ndominant view of touch in the recent cognitive science literature has\ntypically treated touch as inherently multisensory rather than a\nsingle unified modality like vision and audition (for examples and\ndiscussion, see Loomis and Lederman 1986; Fulkerson 2011; Gallace and\nSpence 2014; Jones and Lederman 2006; Linden 2015).\nWork in philosophy on the individuation of the senses has often\nfound touch to be a difficult case. This often has little to do with\nthe physiological and functional diversity alluded to above. Even if\nwe focus only on the phenomenological features of tactual perception,\nor on the typical objects of tactual awareness, touch seems to possess\na diversity that resists any single unified account. Aristotle noted\nthat touch, unlike the other dominant modalities, seemingly lacked a\nsingle \u201cproper sensible\u201d (for a recent empirical\ntreatment, see Kung 2005).  On this account, a proper sensible is a\nsensory feature only available in a single modality, one that was\nconstitutive of that modality (Marmodoro 2014). For\nvision color is the proper sensible. Any experience of color\nis visual, since no other modality provides awareness of that\nfeature. The proper sensibles were contrasted with the common sensibles\nfound in more than one modality. Touch doesn\u2019t have a single\nplausible proper sensible. Instead it has multiple potential proper\nsensibles, including pressure and temperature. This too might be a\nstrong reason for treating touch as a collection of distinct senses\nrather than a single modality.\nThe question of how to individuate sensory modalities has recently\nbeen of central importance in philosophy. In what follows, we will\nbriefly consider a few key accounts and how they might apply to the\nsense of touch.\nOne approach is to treat the individual sensory\nmodalities as specialized informational channels or \u201croutes\ninto\u201d an organism (Keeley 2002). According to this criterion, touch would\nagain seem to count as a collection of multiple sensory modalities,\nsince touch involves a number of distinct informational channels. They\ndiffer in the nature of the stimuli they are sensitive to, the nature\nof their activation profiles and functional properties, and even in\ntheir evolutionary \nhistory.[1]\n Another plausible view that in many ways is more amenable to\nunifying the sense of touch is to treat sensory modalities as a\nconventional kind, something we make use of but that isn\u2019t defined\nentirely by the relevant sciences (Nudds 2003). If this is right,\nthen we shouldn\u2019t expect there to be some underlying\nphysiological unity or connection that grounds our conception of\ntouch. Instead, we use the talk of sensory modalities to mark what a\nsubject might know on the basis of the experience. On this account,\nwhat we call the sense of touch is that form of awareness that\ntypically provides awareness of an object\u2019s weight, texture, and\ntemperature, etc. Learning that Anna touched the vase conveys\nthe information that she was in a position to become aware of the\nwarmth and solidity of the vase, among the other typical tangible\nproperties.\nWe could also reject entirely the idea that we can adequately\nclassify the senses along any single dimension. Instead, we could\nclassify the senses using all of the available criteria, constructing\na multidimensional space of possible sensory modalities (Macpherson\n2010). On this account, touch would be classified according to its\ntypical sensory organs, its representational content, the physical\nstimuli to which it is sensitive, and its phenomenal character. On\nthis view, human touch would seemingly occupy a larger expanse of\nmodality space than the other major human senses. This would probably\nreveal one kind of major difference in kind between human touch and\nthe other sensory modalities.\nAnother option is to argue that, while touch does have a disunified\nand heterogeneous functional and physiological profile, this is also\nlargely true of the other sensory modalities. What each of the\nsystems that seem to be unisensory have in common then isn\u2019t\nunity in any of the major criteria listed above (physiology, content,\nstimuli, etc.). Instead, it could be that each of the diverse\nsystems involved in human touch function together to connect or bind\nsensory features together (Fulkerson 2014c). This binding thesis suggests one way in\nwhich the diverse systems involved in touch might hang together, even\nif there is no single dimension on which touch is always unified.\n",
