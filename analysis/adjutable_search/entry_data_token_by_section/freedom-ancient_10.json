This\nmight seem to make us helpless puppets of god, puppets who cannot rightly be held responsible for what we do. The Stoics, however, develop\na theory of animal behavior generally and human action in particular\nthat tries to counter this suspicion. Like both Aristotle and\nEpicurus, for the Stoics, the possession of reason is key to making humans responsible\nfor their actions.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, inanimate objects like logs and stones are\nmoved around from the outside. Animals, however, move themselves\naround. Animal motion has an internal source, the animal\u2019s own\nmind, which is a material, bodily organ. The Stoics\u2019 distinction\nbetween inanimate and animate motion is reminiscent of\nLucretius\u2019 distinction between the passive way inanimate objects\nare moved around, compared to the active motion of animals, which have\nlibera voluntas and can move themselves around as they wish.\nThe Stoics, however, believe that animals moving themselves around is\ncompatible with the way in which animals move being causally\ndetermined. Animals move themselves when an impression occurs which\narouses an impulse. For instance, a hungry dog may see a hunk of meat,\nand this arouses an impulse to run up to the meat and eat it. The\nimpulse is triggered by the impression, but this is still a case of\nthe dog moving itself toward the meat, not merely being passively\npushed around by the impression.\n\nIn the case of rational animals, like humans, there is a crucial\nadditional step. We have \n\n\nreason, which passes judgment on impressions, rejecting some of these\nand accepting others, in order that the animal may be guided\naccordingly. (Origen, On principles 3.1.2\u20133, LS 53A) \n\n\nFor instance, I may see a pulled-pork sandwich in front of me when I\nam hungry. But instead of saying, \u201cMmmm, looks good\u201d, and\nstraightaway gobbling it down, I think \u201cEating meat produced by\nfactory farms would be wrong\u201d and refrain. On the other hand,\nChrysippus believes that animals are made for the sake for human\nbeings\u2014for instance, that appetizing pigs have no purpose other\nthan slaughter and that god created them as part of our cuisine\n(Porphyry, On Abstinence, 3.20.1, 3, LS 54P). And so, given\nhis foolish and vicious views about the moral status of animals,\nChrysippus would gladly decide to chow down on a pulled-pork\nsandwich.\n\nAny action proper will include this step of assent to an impression\nthat leads to an impulse, and it is this additional step that\ndistinguishes human action from mere animal behavior. This does not\nmean that actions require extended and self-conscious deliberation. If\nyou insult my hipster sideburns and I straightaway get angry and punch\nyou in the face, I have assented to the impression that you have\nwronged me and it would be good to retaliate and cause you pain, even\nthough I haven\u2019t thought it over carefully.\n\nTo illustrate the Stoic doctrine of the internal source of animal\nmotion Chrysippus uses the analogy of a stone cylinder rolling down a\nslope. The cylinder\u2019s rolling down the slope may require an\ninitial shove. But that initial shove only triggers the motion, and\nthe primary cause of the motion is the cylinder\u2019s own shape and\n\u201crollability\u201d. Likewise, human action may require an\ninitial impression as its trigger, but how a person acts depends on\nthe person themself, on the sort of person they are and how they\nrespond to their impressions (Cicero, Fat. 39\u201343, LS\n62C).\n\nAssent is up to us and under our control, and assent is the cause\nof our actions. Therefore, our actions are attributable to us, and we\nare rightly held responsible for them. I do not control whether I am\nhealthy, although I can aim at maintaining my health. I do not\ncontrol whether other people hurl insults at me, but it is up to me\nwhether I react angrily when I am insulted. What we do is controlled\nby our will and intellect, and the misdeeds of bad people can rightly\nbe attributed to their own vice (Gellius, Noctes Atticae,\n7.2.6\u201313, LS 62D).\n\nThe Stoics reject the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP). We\ndon\u2019t have \n\n\nthe freedom to choose between opposite actions \u2026 [instead], it\nis what comes about through us that is up to us. (Alexander,\nOn fate ch. 13, 181,13, LS 62G1) \n\n\nAssent is up to us and under our control, and we are rightly\nheld responsible for what we do, even though we do not have the\nability to do otherwise than we do. If we accept PAP, then the actions\nof the virtuous person will be praiseworthy only if they are capable\nof acting in a way other than how they do act. But the truly virtuous\nperson is incapable of acting viciously, of doing anything wrong.\nImagine that I am a virtuous person, and that I have promised my young\ndaughter a piece of cake if she finishes her dinner. She finishes her\ndinner and asks for the cake. There is only one action that I can and\nwill do in that particular situation: give her the cake as promised.\nLet us suppose that there was some small chance that I would\nnot keep my promise\u2014that I\u2019d pretend to look for the cake\nand not find it, and lie to her about its being missing, so that I\ncould have it for myself later. If I were capable of depriving my\ndaughter of her promised cake so that I could chow down on it later,\nthen I would not really be a virtuous person. There would have to be\nsomething wrong with me. And so if we accept PAP, we would have to\naccept the absurd result that we should not praise virtuous people for\nacting virtuously, as they cannot do anything other than the virtuous\naction in any situation. And so, we should reject PAP (Alexander,\nOn fate ch. 26, 196,24\u2013197,3, LS 61M).\n\nAristotle would say that the virtuous person will not break\ntheir promise to their daughter, but that they are capable of\ndoing so. The Stoics reject this response. Virtue is a reliable\ndisposition to do what one should. I am not forced to get the\ncake for my daughter, but if I am truly a good person, I am incapable\nof doing otherwise, because I cannot but want to get her the cake\n(Seneca On Benefits 6.21.2\u20133). The Stoics conceive of virtue\nas a kind as practical skill that allows a person to live well, and\nthe wise person will consistently exercise this skill, so that\neverything they do they do well (Stobaeus Eclogues\n2.66,14\u201367,4, LS 61G). So an \u201cability\u201d to break my promise\nto my daughter is something I do not want to have, as it would be a\ndefect, a form of folly, and a disability.\n\nThe Stoics believe that their doctrine that god causally determines\nour every action is compatible with all of our ordinary moral\npractices. They share with Aristotle the idea that virtue is a\nperfection of our nature as rational and social animals, and they\nbelieve that the proper action to perform is the one that can be given\na reasonable justification. (See the texts in Long and Sedley sections\n59\u201361.) Let us suppose that causal determinism is true and that I\nbreak my promise to my daughter and chow down on the cake. Even if\nevery action is causally determined by God, right reason still\ncommands right actions and prohibits wrong ones. We can still give the\nreasons why breaking my promise to my daughter is irrational and\nwrong, and why keeping my promise would be rational and right. So,\neven though I was causally determined to break my promise, my doing so\nwas wrong. And if there are right and wrong actions, there are also\nvirtues and vices, character traits that dispose us to act rightly and\nwrongly, respectively. So, in the example above, I am a vicious\nperson: I am the kind of person who will break his promise to his\ndaughter for the sake of filling his belly. But virtue is noble, and\nthus commendable, whereas vice is shameful, and thus reprehensible.\nAnd commendable things deserve honor, whereas reprehensible things\ndeserve censure and punishment. So I am a shameful, reprehensible\nperson, and I am rightly criticized for my action (Alexander, On\nFate ch. 35, 207, 5\u201321, LS 62J).\n\nWhile the Stoics think that vicious people are responsible for what\nthey do, and that wrongdoing merits censure and punishment, they\nreject retributive punishment, punishment that seeks to set back a\nperson\u2019s interests as fitting payback for the wrong they have\ndone. Like god, the virtuous person wishes to harm none and to benefit\nall. We should regard ourselves as akin to all human beings, and we\nshould seek to benefit as many people as we can (Cicero Fin.\n3.62\u20138, LS 57F). Punishment is a fitting response to wrongdoing, but\nright punishment is rehabilitative, a loving correction of\nthe person punished (Alexander, On fate ch. 35, 207,5\u201321, LS\n62J). The model here is akin to parental discipline. If my sons are\nsquabbling, and one of them angrily hits the other, I might send him\nto time-out, deprive him of dessert, and ground him for a week. But I\ndo not do so because I want my son to suffer or I think he had it\ncoming to him. Instead, while my son might find the punishment\npainful, I inflict the punishment because I think that the discipline\nwill be good for him, that it will help him realize that he has done something\nwrong and that he needs to change himself. In their theory of\npunishment, as in much of their ethical theory, the Stoics are\nfollowing the lead of Plato, who also rejects retributive punishment\nin favor of rehabilitative punishment. (See in particular\nProtagoras 323d-324d and Gorgias 472d-479e.) Plato,\nhowever, rejects retribution in part because he believes that all\nwrongdoing is due to ignorance of what is good. Hence, he thinks,\nnobody does wrong willingly, and nobody is deserving of retributive\npunishment.\n\nAccording to the Stoics, both the virtuous, wise person and the\nvicious fool are responsible for their actions, because the actions of\neach of them are equally a result of their assent, which is under\ntheir control. Nonetheless, in another sense, only the wise person is\ntruly free (DL 7.33). The later Stoic Epictetus often compares the\nfoolish person to a slave, under the yolk of vicious and damaging\ndesires (for instance, Handbook 14 and Discourses\n2.2). Similarly, the Stoic emperor Marcus Aurelius likens the fool to\na puppet who is jerked here and there by irrational impulses (for\ninstance, Meditations 2.2, 6.16). The fool is dominated by\ndesires and beliefs that are alien to his nature as a rational being,\nbecause right reason commands all virtuous actions and forbids all\nvicious actions. Only the wise person is free from these alienating\nand disturbing desires and beliefs; only the wise person has mastered\nhimself and is in harmony with himself.\n 2.6 Alexander of Aphrodisias\u2019 incompatibilist Aristotelianism\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias is an adherent of Aristotle\u2019s\nphilosophy, best known for his extensive commentaries on\nAristotle\u2019s texts. In his treatise On Fate, Alexander\ndevelops an Aristotelian theory on human freedom in reaction to the\nStoics\u2019 clearly determinist and compatibilist theory.\nAlexander\u2019s theory is based on what Aristotle says, and he\nclaims simply to be presenting Aristotle\u2019s views. But\nAlexander\u2019s treatment takes many elements of Aristotle, which on\ntheir own can be read as either compatible with causal determinism or\nincompatible with causal determinism, and develops them in\nincompatibilist ways. Alexander thinks that causal determinism is\nincompatible both with effective deliberation and with the sort of\ncontrol over our actions needed for moral responsibility.\n\nThe Stoics identify fate with the causal organization of the cosmos.\nEvery thing that occurs has a cause which is sufficient to produce\nexactly that outcome. And given the totality of circumstances, it is\ncausally impossible for things not to turn out the particular way that\nthey do (Alexander, On Fate ch. 22). Alexander believes that\nhaving things causally determined by fate in this way is incompatible\nwith some outcomes being contingent. On the Stoic position, if there\nis going to be a sea battle tomorrow, the causal structure of the\ncosmos guarantees that there will be a sea battle tomorrow and makes\nit impossible that there not be a sea battle tomorrow (Alexander,\nOn Fate ch. 9). But deliberating about things that will\nnecessarily occur or necessarily not occur is pointless; it makes\nsense to deliberate only about things that can either possibly occur\nor not. Furthermore, if I deliberate about whether to instigate a sea\nbattle or not, it makes sense to do so only if I have the ability\neither to instigate a sea battle or not to do so. I do not deliberate\nwhether or not to fly if I cannot fly, or if I must fly\n(Alexander, On Fate ch. 11\u201312). So, effective deliberation\nrequires that a person have the ability to do otherwise than they do,\nand Alexander thinks that such an ability is incompatible with causal\ndeterminism.\n\nAlexander also believes that the Stoic position implies that our\nactions are not really \u201cup to us\u201d, i.e., that we do not\nhave the sort of control over our actions which is required to be\nrightly praised, blamed, rewarded, or punished for them. Alexander\nthinks this because he subscribes to something like the principle that\n\u201cought implies can\u201d, i.e., that a person can be morally\nobligated to do something only if they have the ability to do it. This\nis shown in our own case, when we feel regret and blame ourselves for\ndoing something because we think we were able not to choose to do the\nevil thing we had done (Alexander, On Fate ch. 12,\n180.29\u201331). And in the case of other people, too, we blame and punish\nthem on the assumption that they were able to refrain from wrongdoing.\nIf they had to do what they did, under the circumstances, they are\nblameless. (Alexander thinks that it is inadequate to say that they\nwould have acted differently if circumstances had been different;\nAlexander, On Fate ch. 16.)\n\nAlexander turns Chrysippus\u2019 analogy of the cylinder rolling down\nthe slope against the Stoic position. Chrysippus says that, while an\ninitial shove is required to get the cylinder moving, whether and how\nthe cylinder rolls depends on its shape, and likewise, while an\ninitial impression is needed to get a person moving, how they respond\nto the impression depends on the type of person they are, and thus\nthey are responsible for how they act. But, says Alexander, round\nthings must roll down a slope when shoved; it is not up to them\nwhether or not to roll. Instead, they are compelled to roll by a kind\nof internal necessity. And if the Stoics are right, vicious people are\nlikewise compelled by their vicious natures, by a kind of internal\nnecessity, to do their evil deeds (Alexander, On Fate ch.\n17).\n\nLike Carneades, Alexander believes that his own doctrine of free\nchoice doesn\u2019t introduce motion without a cause. A person has\nvarious motives they can act on: they may want to obtain this pleasure\nor that one, or to get something that they believe is to their\nadvantage, or to do something because they think it\u2019s the right\nthing to do. Nothing predetermines or necessitates what the person\nwill end up freely choosing to do: they might accept this job or that\none, given the competing considerations in favor of each, and they can\nvalue the pleasure of cake over the importance of keeping their\npromises, or vice-versa. But no matter what they end up choosing, they\nare the cause of their own choices and of the actions that result from\nthem (Alexander, On Fate ch. 15).\n\nBut what about the thoroughly virtuous person? Alexander agrees with\nthe Stoics that virtuous people are psychologically incapable of doing\nanything vicious. However, it does not follow that every action they\nperform is causally necessitated. There is often a range of available\nactions that are consistent with virtue, or some leeway in the\nprecise way in which they may do the action which virtue requires, and\nit is up to them which of these options they choose (Alexander, On\nFate ch. 29). Alexander also follows Aristotle in thinking that\npeople are responsible for developing their character through their\nown voluntary actions, in a way analogous to developing skills through\npractice. This, thinks Alexander, distinguishes virtuous humans from\nthe gods. Humans are not by nature virtuous. Instead, they have to\ndevelop their virtue, and they are capable of either becoming virtuous\nor not. And so, we praise the person who develops the virtues, because\nthe type of person they became was up to them. But the gods\nnecessarily possess their goodness as a kind of natural gift, and they\nare incapable of becoming bad. And so, because their goodness was not\nup to them, we rightly honor the gods for their goodness, but we do not\npraise them (Alexander, On Fate chs. 27, 32).\n 2.7 Plotinus on freedom and the good\n\nPlotinus is a follower of Plato, and in his attempt to spell out\nsystematically the truths contained in Plato\u2019s dialogues, he\nfounded the philosophical movement nowadays called Neoplatonism. He\ndevelops a distinctive position on human freedom, one that overlaps\nconsiderably with the Stoics\u2019 position. However, because of his\ndeep metaphysical differences with the Stoics, he breaks with them on\nthe role of fate in producing human action.\n\nFor Plotinus, to say that something is \u201cup to us\u201d is to\nsay that we have power or mastery over it. He contrasts this mastery\nwith servitude or slavery. True power is the power to do what we wish,\nin order to gain what we desire. So Plotinus thinks that a person who\nacts under compulsion is not acting freely. He also agrees with\nAristotle that a person who acts in ignorance of the particulars of\nhis situation is not acting voluntarily: if I inadvertently poison my\nmother with cyanide-laced Tylenol, I am not doing what I wished to do,\nas I did not wish to poison my mother. But he disagrees with\nAristotle, and agrees with Plato, in thinking that ignorance of the\nrightness or wrongness of what I propose to do excuses (Enn.\nVI.8[39].1). Plotinus believes that all desire is desire for the good\n(Enn. VI.8[39].7). If I poison my mother, I do so because I\nbelieve that doing so is good for me. But if I\u2019m wrong about\nthat, then when I kill her, I\u2019m not really gaining what I\ndesire, because I wanted to get what was good for me. (It\u2019s for\nthese sorts of reasons that Plato, in Gorgias 466c-468e,\ndenies that a tyrant who is able to kill, torture, or imprison anybody\nas he sees fit has great power. Power enables a person to get what\nthey desire, which is what is good for them, and the tyrant\u2019s\nso-called \u201cpower\u201d actually harms him.)\n\nFollowing Plato in the Republic, Plotinus repeatedly asserts\nthat for the mind to be controlled by the appetites or passions is a\nkind of slavery, because the mind is being controlled by something\noutside of itself (Enn. VI.8[39].2, VI.8[39].3). Reason\nshould rule the person, and an action is free if it proceeds from\nknowledge (Enn. VI.8[39].1, VI.8[39].6). So Plotinus joins\nthe Stoics in thinking that only the wise person is free.\n\u201cFreedom\u201d in this sense is primarily an ethical ideal, not\na condition on moral responsibility.\n\nBecause freedom is a power to obtain what is truly good for yourself,\nPlotinus also joins the Stoics in rejecting the principle that, in\norder to be in control of what you do, you must have the ability to do\notherwise than you do. Let us imagine that my daughter has a serious\nheart condition, and after researching the options to repair her\nheart, I follow the correct course of action, both because I love her\nand because I recognize that doing so is also good for me. If my\nreason is in charge of what I do, and I know that what I am doing is\nfor the best, then I am incapable of not doing what I do. But it not\nsome lack of power or external obstacle that prevents me from\nneglecting my daughter and doing what is worse. Instead, my action is\nan expression of my knowledge and my will, and that is why I cannot do\notherwise (Enn. VI.8[39].10). Likewise, Plotinus thinks it\nwould be perverse to say that I am forced or compelled to help my\ndaughter, that my action is involuntary because it springs from some\nsort of \u201cinternal necessity\u201d. Instead, an action is free\nwhen it is directed towards a good that you recognize, and slavery\nconsists in being powerless to move towards your good. This is the\nkind of freedom enjoyed by the divine intellect. Plotinus believes\nthat the Form of the Good, as described in places like book 6 of\nPlato\u2019s Republic, is the transcendent source of\neverything that exists. (Plotinus sometimes calls it the One, to\nstress its simplicity.) The divine intellect fully understands and\neternally contemplates the Good, and it does so freely\u2014for why\nwould it not do so? (Enn. VI.8[39].4)\n\nPlotinus wants to allow the wise person untrammeled mastery, and so he\nrestricts the scope of their freedom to their reasoning and will, and\nnot, strictly speaking, to their actions. If I am wise, I have control\nover my reasoning and the decisions I make on account of my reasoning.\nBut which actions I perform are not entirely up to me, but depend on\nexternal circumstances beyond my control. If I am a brave person, I\nwill stand ready to risk my life in war for a noble cause, but such a\nwar may never arise. And of course, the effects of my actions are not\nup to me\u2014perhaps my daughter will die of her heart condition\ndespite my best efforts (Enn. VI.8[39].5). However, because\nhappiness consists in wisdom and virtue, the wise person\u2019s\ninability to entirely control their actions or their actions\u2019\neffects does nothing to prevent them from having the sort of power\nthat matters\u2014the power to obtain what is good. This aspect of\nPlotinus\u2019 thought echoes the Roman Stoic Epictetus. In order to\nbe happy, says Epictetus, we must distinguish between what is up to us\nand what is not, and the one thing that god has placed under our\ncontrol is the correct use of impressions i.e., to decide rightly what\nto believe and what to do (Epictetus, Discourses 1.1.7\u201312, LS\n62K). Because Epictetus thinks that freedom consists in our control\nover an internal power of assent, Frede (2011) claims that the notion\nof a \u201cfree will\u201d first appears in Epictetus.\n\nDespite the considerable overlap between Plotinus and the Stoics on\nfreedom, they differ significantly on fate. The Stoics think that\ngod\u2019s mind is a fiery breath. It is a material substance that\npervades the cosmos and causally determines every event that will\noccur through its organization of the cosmos, which includes the\nmatter that makes up our own minds. The motions in the cosmos, then,\nare the result of both the operations of matter and\nof reason. Plotinus, on the other hand, distinguishes the causal\ninfluences of matter and of mind. The One, the divine intellect, soul,\nand our intellects are all immaterial, and bodies are the lowest form\nof beings. For Plotinus, any purely materialistic metaphysics, such as\nthe Epicureans\u2019 scheme of atoms moving in the void, cannot\nexplain the operations of mind, which stands above matter\n(Enn. III.1[3].3).\n\nPlotinus criticizes the Stoics because, on their theory, humans and\ntheir minds are parts of god, and god works his will through human\nactions. Plotinus believes that, if this were true, our decisions\nwould be caused by something outside of ourselves and would not really\nbe our own\u2014we would not be agents any more than our feet are,\nwhen we use them to kick something. (The Stoics would reply that\nhumans both move themselves and are moved by god through\nfate.) Furthermore, the Stoics\u2019 theory has the unacceptable\nresult of making god the cause of evil, when humans act wrongly\n(Enn. III.1[3].4). Instead, says Plotinus, we should hold\nthat human minds are genuinely separate things, and that they are\nself-movers, the cause of their own thoughts and decisions\n(Enn. III.1[3].4, III.1[3].8, III.2[47].7). Here, Plotinus\nagain follows Plato, who in his creation-myth the Timaeus\nasserts that human souls are distinct from the world-soul that\nanimates the cosmos (Tim. 41d).\n\nFor Plotinus, wrongdoing is involuntary, because it is always due to\nignorance, but the evil person is still its cause (Enn.\nIII.2[47].10). The wrongdoer is not culpable for what they do, but\nthey still suffer two sorts of punishments\u2014although these\npunishments might better be called \u201cconsequences\u201d. The\nfirst penalty they pay for their wrongdoing is becoming evil, which is\nbad for them (Enn. III.2[47].4; III.2[47].8; cf. Plato,\nLaws 728b-c). Secondly, our behavior in this life will have\nan impact on how we will fare in our future lives. Plotinus believes\nin a cycle of reincarnation in which past wrongs lead to future\nsuffering (Enn. III.2[47].12). Furthermore, the choices a\nperson makes within this life will determine the sort of animal (or\nplant) they are reincarnated as, with those who maintain the human\nlevel becoming humans once again, whereas those dominated by passions\nor appetites reincarnated as an appropriate sort of animal or plant\n(Enn. III.4[15].2).\n\nPlotinus develops his theory of reincarnation as a reading of\nPlato\u2019s Myth of Er, which closes the Republic\n(Rep. 614b-621d). In the Myth, disembodied souls between\ncycles of reincarnation have a variety of lives to choose between.\nWhich life they choose is entirely up to them, and the gods are not to\nblame. However, once they choose a particular life, they are bound by\nnecessity to that life and to the events within that life\u2014for\ninstance, a greedy soul chooses the life of a tyrant without examining\nit closely, only to realize after his choice that he is fated to eat\nhis children. On a literal reading, the myth seems to confine control\nover what will happen within one\u2019s life to the choice one makes\nprior to that life, as a disembodied soul. But Plotinus thinks that\nthe Myth is an allegory for how all of the soul\u2019s choices in\nthis life shape what will happen to it in the future (Enn.\nIII.4[15].3; III.4[15].5). It is better to be incarnated in some\nbodies rather than others\u2014it is better to be a human rather than\na wolf, and some humans have bodily temperaments more conducive to\ngoodness than others. Nonetheless, the body one is incarnated into\ndoes not determine what one will do; it is up to the soul what it will\ndo given the opportunities available to it within that life\n(Enn. III.4[15].5).\n",
