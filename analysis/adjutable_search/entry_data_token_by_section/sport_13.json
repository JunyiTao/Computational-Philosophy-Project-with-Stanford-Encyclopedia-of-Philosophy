    "main_text": "Topics in the Philosophy of Sport || Disability Sport\n3.7 Disability Sport\n\n\n\u2018Disability sport\u2019, also referred to as\n\u2018Paralympic sport\u2019 or \u2018sport for athletes with\ndisabilities or impairments\u2019 contrasts with sport for able-bodied\npersons. The two principal ethical questions that arise regarding\ndisability sport are: 1. What criteria should be used to classify\ndisability athletes in competition?; and 2. Should disability athletes,\nspecifically those with prosthetic limbs, be allowed to compete with\nable-bodied athletes?\n\n\nWho may be considered a Paralympic athlete? In order to compete in\ndisability or Paralympic sport, one must be classed as having a\ndisability. The notion of disability is a contested concept (Boorse\n2010, 2011; Nordenfelt 1987, 2007). It is unsurprising, then, that,\nwhat counts as a disability for the purpose of sport and how to\ncategorise those with disabilities for the purpose of competition are\nmatters of some dispute (Edwards and McNamee 2015). For example, for an\nathlete to qualify as a disability athlete, must her disability be\npermanent, or could it be temporary? Could the disability be only\nsomewhat impairing or must it be profoundly impairing?\n\n\nCentral to this dispute is whether it is preferable to adopt a\n\u2018functional classification system\u2019, which would group\ntogether athletes with different disabilities but similar ability\nlevels, or a \u2018disability-specific classification system\u2019,\nwhich would group together athletes with similar types of disabilities\ndespite different capabilities. At least for the purposes of the\nquadrennial Paralympic Games, this question cannot be addressed\nadequately in isolation from the proper aims of the Paralympic\nMovement, including whether these aims are in contrast with, or even in\ntension with, those of elite able-bodied sport.\n\n\nThe second question concerns the appropriate relation between\ndisabled and able-bodied sport. Specifically, should disabled athletes\nwho use prosthetic limbs be allowed to compete in able-bodied sport?\nOscar Pistorius was controversially permitted to compete in the 400m\nat the Olympic Games in 2012 (in addition to the 2012 Paralympic Games)\ndespite using carbon-fibre prosthetic legs. Some objected that his\nprosthetic legs conferred him with an unfair advantage while others\nquestioned whether the prosthetics precluded him from\n\u2018running\u2019 in the relevant sense at all (Edwards, 2008).\n\n\nFinally, the practice of Therapeutic Use Exemptions (TUEs) operates\nin elite able-bodied and disability sport to allow athletes with\nchronic or temporary illness to use medication for therapeutic (as\nopposed to enhancement) purposes that they would otherwise be prohibited\nfrom using. This practice has proved controversial as the\ntherapy/enhancement distinction is difficult to specify with precision\n(Daniels, 2000), and the system has been criticised as open to abuse.\nHowever, if the use of such substances were denied across the board,\nathletes with chronic conditions, for example, would effectively be\nexcluded from sport on account of being unfairly disadvantaged (Pike,\n2018).\n",
