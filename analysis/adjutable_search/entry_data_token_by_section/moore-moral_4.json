    "main_text": "The Ideal\n5. Influence\n\nDespite not always containing entirely new ideas, Moore\u2019s\nethical writings, and especially Principia Ethica, were\nextremely influential, both outside and within philosophy. Outside\nphilosophy one influence was through the literary and artistic figures\nin the Bloomsbury Group, such as Keynes, Lytton Strachey, and Leonard\nand Virginia Woolf, several of whom had come to know Moore while\nmembers with him of the Apostles. They were most impressed by the last\nchapter of Principia Ethica, whose identification of\naesthetic appreciation and personal love as the highest goods very\nmuch fit their predilections. Keynes said the book\u2019s publication\nwas for them \u201cthe opening of a new heaven on a new earth\u201d\nand its theory of the good became for a time their\n\u201creligion\u201d (1949: 82) Many of them \u2013 the gay men in\nparticular \u2013 sexualized Moore\u2019s account of love, adding an\nerotic element not present in his formulations. But according to\nKeynes (though Leonard Woolf (1960: 146\u201349) disagreed), they\ntended to ignore the impartial consequentialism within which he\nembedded those goods, concentrating on pursuing them just within their\nown lives rather than encouraging their wider spread in society. The\nnovels of E.M. Forster, another Cambridge Apostle, contain several\nfigures representing Moorean ideas, for example the Schlegel sisters\nin Howards End (Sidorsky 2007). An important element in\nPrincipia Ethica\u2019s extra-philosophical appeal was its\nbrash iconoclasm, its claiming, however inaccurately, to sweep away\nall past moral philosophy. This tone entirely fit its time, when the\ndeath of Queen Victoria had led many in Britain to think a new, more\nprogressive age was dawning.\n\nThe book\u2019s influence within philosophy was even greater. On the\nnormative side, views close to its ideal consequentialism remained\nprominent and even dominant, at least in Britain, until the 1930s,\nthough it is hard to know how far this is attributable to Moore\nhimself since similar views had been widely accepted before him. In\nmetaethics his non-naturalism likewise remained dominant for several\ndecades, though here Moore played a larger role, especially for later\nwriters, in part because of his general philosophical eminence and in\npart because of the vigor with which he presented the view. By talking\nexplicitly of non-natural properties he at least seemed to give\nnon-naturalism a more robust metaphysical side than predecessors such\nas Sidgwick had, and he defended the view more emphatically, in\nparticular by putting more weight on the open-question argument. When\nSidgwick noticed Bentham or Spencer equating goodness with a natural\nproperty such as pleasure, he thought it a minor slip that ought in\ncharity to be ignored; Moore deemed it a decisive error that vitiated\nthe philosopher\u2019s entire system. By so emphasizing the two\nelements of non-naturalism \u2013 its realism and its commitment to\nthe autonomy of ethics \u2013 Moore helped initiate a sequence of\ndevelopments in 20th-century metaethics.\n\nThe first reaction to non-naturalism, other than simple acceptance,\ncame from philosophers who endorsed the autonomy of ethics but,\nsometimes under the influence of logical positivism, rejected its\nmoral realism, holding instead that there are no facts other than\nnatural ones and no modes of knowing other than the empirical and the\nstrictly logical. They therefore developed various versions of\nnon-cognitivism, which hold that moral judgements are not true or\nfalse but express attitudes, as in emotivism (Ayer 1936; Stevenson\n1944), or issue something like imperatives, as in prescriptivism (Hare\n1952; Hare 1963). Unlike the subjective naturalism Moore criticized in\nEthics, these views allow moral disagreement, since attitudes\nand imperatives can oppose each other, for example positive versus\nnegative. They also, their later proponents held, give a better\nexplanation of the open-question argument, since they find a\ndistinctive emotive or action-guiding force in moral concepts and\njudgements that is not present in non-moral ones; that is why, it was\nsaid, the moral is neither reducible to nor derivable from the\nnon-moral. Non-cognitivism can also explain, some said, why morality\nmatters to us as it does. Non-naturalism implies that moral judgements\nconcern a mysterious type of property, but why should facts about that\nproperty be important to us or influence our behavior? If moral\njudgements express deep-seated attitudes, however, the question\nanswers itself.\n\nA later reaction, starting around the mid-century, rejected both\nnon-naturalism and non-cognitivism and explored versions of\nnaturalism, including a neo-Aristotelian version that grounds all\nethical demands in a conception of human flourishing, or of the\ndevelopment of a human nature understood in quasi-biological terms\n(Anscombe 1958; Foot 2001); this view implicitly denies the autonomy\nof ethics. Here a specifically ant-Moorean claim was that predicative\nuses of \u201cgood,\u201d as in Moore\u2019s \u201caesthetic\nappreciation is good,\u201d are ungrammatical, since the only\nlegitimate uses of the word in English are attributive, as in\n\u201cgood knife,\u201d \u201cgood pickpocket,\u201d and, most\nrelevantly to the neo-Aristotelian view, \u201cgood human\nbeing\u201d (Geach 1956; also Thomson 1997). But, despite being made\nat the high-water mark of ordinary-language philosophy, this claim\nabout English grammar seems plainly false: the language has always\nallowed predicative uses of \u201cgood,\u201d from the King James\ntranslation of Genesis \u2013 \u201cGod saw the light, that it was\ngood\u201d (cited in Butchvarov 1989: 17) \u2013 to everyday phrases\nsuch as \u201cIt is good that \u2026\u201d Moore\u2019s moral\nphilosophy cannot credibly be dismissed as resting on a crude\nlinguistic error (see also e.g. Pigden 1990; Zimmerman 1999; Kraut\n2011: 173\u201383). One strand in this later reaction, like others\ninfluenced by Wittgenstein, rejected the calculating side of\nMoore\u2019s consequentialism, which identifies right and wrong acts\nby adding up the goods and evils in their consequences. Moral\njudgements, some argued, can\u2019t be codified or theorized in this\nway but instead call for ethically trained and sensitive insight into\nparticular situations as particular (e.g. McDowell 1979). Even apart\nfrom that there was, in many circles, skepticism about the supposed\nextravagance and dogmatism of Moore\u2019s substantive claims about\nthe good \u2013 such as his specific valuing of aesthetic\nappreciation and personal love \u2013 and a preference for the\nallegedly more modest view that what is good in people\u2019s lives\nis just the fulfilment of whatever desires they have. By the 1960s, it\nseems fair to say, many of Moore\u2019s views were thought deeply\nproblematic and his moral philosophy as a whole was not considered an\nespecially live option. It was still thought important to read\nPrincipia Ethica, or at least its first chapter, as having\ninitiated the sequence of developments that led to the then-current\nviews. But from the standpoint of many of those views, Moore\u2019s\ngeneral approach to ethics was at key points misguided.\n\nFifty-plus years later the philosophical climate is more favorable to\nMoore. A number of philosophers now defend metaethical non-naturalism\n(e.g. Shafer-Landau 2003; Huemer 2006), either in versions they say\nare ontologically minimalist (Nagel 1986; Scanlon 1998, 2014; Parfit\n2011, vol. 2: 464\u201387) or in ones they present as more robust\n(Enoch 2011), but all embracing some account of normative truth that\nseparates it sharply from non-normative, for example scientific,\ntruth. In addition, and of necessity, these current versions of\nnon-naturalism share something close to Moore\u2019s moral\nepistemology, his view that normative truths are known by a kind of\ndirect insight or intuition, though the present-day views are often\nmore explicitly fallibilist and coherentist than his sometimes\nappeared to be. Still, for many philosophers, Moore\u2019s version of\nnon-naturalist realism remains the best-known or canonical one. In\nnormative ethics, too, there is increasing sympathy for accounts of\nthe good with an ideal or perfectionist content and admiration for\nparticular features of Moore\u2019s own account, such as his valuing\nof personal love, his recursive principles (Hurka 2001) and his\nprinciple of organic unities. Moorean ideas are by no means the only\nones alive in present-day moral philosophy; there are many\nalternatives, including many that reject, for example, his\nconsequentialism and impartialism. One especially relevant strand in\nthe recent literature, dating from the 1980s, says ethics needs the\nnon-Moorean concept of \u201cgood for\u201d mentioned above, which\nis associated with \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201cprudential\nvalue\u201d and also distinct from the agent-relative goodness\nSidgwick used to state egoism. Here one view proposes to use this\nalternative concept in addition to the Moorean \u201cgood,\u201d so\nwhat is simply good is wholly or at least largely what is good\n\u201cfor\u201d individuals (e.g. Sumner 1996). Another, more\nradical view wants \u201cgood for\u201d to entirely replace\nMoore\u2019s \u201cgood,\u201d so the former is the only ethically\nsignificant evaluative concept (e.g. Kraut 2007; Kraut 2011). (The\nargument here is not, as in Geach, that the Moorean \u201cgood\u201d\nis ungrammatical; it is that, though linguistically unimpeachable, it\nmakes no useful contribution to ethical thought.) But there have also\nbeen defences, against these views, of Moore\u2019s \u201csimply\ngood\u201d and his reductive or \u201clocative\u201d account of\n\u201cgood for\u201d (e.g. McDaniel 2014; Rowland 2016; Tucker 2018;\nHurka 2021). Often what present-day philosophers take from Moore is\njust an individual idea or argument rather than his theory as a whole\n(Regan 2003 is an exception). But whereas in the early 20th century\nMoore\u2019s approach to ethics, and especially his metaethics, was\ndominant, at least in British moral philosophy, and whereas in the\nmid-century it was widely dismissed, it now represents, at several\npoints, a valuable contributor to many lively ongoing debates.\n",
