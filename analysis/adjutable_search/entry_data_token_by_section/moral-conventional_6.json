Empirical Challenges to Turiel\u2019s Definition of Morality: Does It Fail in Other Cultures?\n\nThe definition of morality proposed by Turiel and his associates is an\nempirical hypothesis about the sorts of transgressions that will evoke\nmoral criterion judgments. And while the hypothesis has evolved over\nthe last four decades, a core feature of work in the Turiel tradition\nis that harm plays a central role. Most of the experiments designed to\nexplore the boundaries of the moral domain include transgressions that\ncause obvious harm, and it is predicted, almost always correctly, that\nthese will lead participants to make moral criterion judgments. It is\nalso predicted that transgressions that do not cause obvious harm, and\nthat are not obvious examples of injustice or the violation of\nrights\u2014or, more recently, of unfairness or of treating people\nunequally\u2014will not evoke moral criterion judgments, and\nthus that people do not treat them as moral transgressions. But this\nsecond prediction has been the focus of a widely discussed empirical\ncritique of Turiel\u2019s definition of morality. The critics\u2019\ncentral contention, in Jonathan Haidt\u2019s memorable phrase, is\nthat Turiel\u2019s definition of morality \u201cdoes not travel\nwell\u201d (Haidt 2012: 22).\n\nThe first influential challenge along these lines was mounted by\nRichard Shweder and colleagues who argued that the sort of normative\njudgments that Turiel would classify as conventional play a much\nsmaller role in many non-Western societies, and that in those\nsocieties the moral domain\u2014the class of transgressions that\nTuriel\u2019s test or something in that vicinity would classify as\nmoral\u2014includes a wide range of actions in which no one is\nharmed, no injustice is done, and no rights are violated.\n\nMuch of the evidence Shweder offered for this claim came from an\nextensive study of the normative judgments of orthodox Hindus in India\nand of Christians and Jews in the USA (Shweder, Mahapatra, &\nMiller 1987). The Indian participants lived in a residential community\nsurrounding an eleventh and twelfth century Hindu temple in the city\nof Bhubaneswar. The Americans were recruited from a middle class\nneighborhood near the University of Chicago. The study collected\njudgments about a wide range of normatively regulated practices\nincluding\n\n\nforms of address\u2026, sleeping arrangements, incest avoidance,\ndietary practices, forms of dress, \u2026 begging, nepotism,\nmonogamy, wife beating, \u2026 the protection of persons from\nphysical and psychological harm, funeral rites \u2026. (1987: 4)\n\n\nA major goal of the study was to test Turiel\u2019s hypothesis that\ntransgressions that did not involve harm or other elements included in\nTuriel\u2019s definition of morality would be judged to be\nconventional rather than moral using questions similar to\nTuriel\u2019s criterion judgment questions. Participants were\npresented with a variety of brief vignettes, including these:\n\nWhile walking, a man saw a dog sleeping on the road. He walked up\nto it and kicked it.\nThe day after his father\u2019s death, the eldest son had a\nhaircut and ate chicken.\nA widow in your community eats fish two or three times a\nweek.\n\n\nNot surprisingly, both the Indian and the American participants judged\nthe behavior described in (1) to be wrong, and using the questions\nthat Schweder and colleagues constructed to determine whether\nparticipants regarded a judgment to be moral or conventional, both\ngroups regarded (1) to be a moral transgression. That, of course, is\nwhat Turiel would predict. But the responses to (2) and (3) appeared\nto be much more problematic for Turiel. Though the American\nparticipants did not judge them to be wrong at all, the Indian\nparticipants judged them to be quite serious transgressions, and their\nresponses to questions designed to determine whether they viewed the\ntransgressions as moral or conventional indicated that they viewed\nthem as moral. Since neither the son\u2019s behavior in (2) nor the\nwidow\u2019s behavior in (3) does any obvious harm, commits no\nobvious injustice, and seems to violate no one\u2019s rights, Shweder\nand colleagues argued that these responses, along with the Indian\nparticipants\u2019 responses about many of the other vignettes, posed\na major challenge for Turiel. The class of transgressions treated as\nmoral by the Indian participants was much larger than Turiel\u2019s\ndefinition of morality predicted, and the class of conventional\ntransgressions was vanishingly small.\n\nTuriel was not convinced. In a lengthy response, Turiel, Killen, and\nHelwig (1987) argued that Shweder\u2019s putatively troubling\nexamples relied on profound differences between the non-moral beliefs\nof Shweder\u2019s Indian and American participants. For the\nAmericans, getting a haircut, eating chicken, and eating fish are all\nentirely harmless, so it is no surprise that they judged the\nson\u2019s behavior and the widow\u2019s to be unproblematic. But,\nas Shweder himself had noted in an earlier paper, the Indians believed\nthat if a son were to eat chicken the day after his father\u2019s\ndeath, it would result in his father\u2019s soul not receiving\nsalvation (Shweder & Miller 1985: 48). They also believed that\nfish is a \u201chot\u201d food that would stimulate the\nwidow\u2019s sexual appetite and might lead her to have sex, which\nwould offend her husband\u2019s spirit and lead to great suffering\n(Turiel, Killen, &\u00a0Helwig 1987: 209). The Indian participants\nclassified more transgressions as moral, Turiel and colleagues argued,\nnot because they have a more inclusive definition of morality, but\nrather because they believed many more actions to be harmful.\n\nThis response led Jonathan Haidt to design a study in which he\nexplored people\u2019s reactions to what he characterized as\n\u201charmless taboo violations\u201d, (Haidt 2012: 19). Several of\nthese, including the two below, were, and were intended to be, rather\nshocking:\n\nDog: A family\u2019s dog was killed by a car\nin front of their house. They had heard that dog meat was delicious,\nso they cut up the dog\u2019s body and cooked it and ate it for\ndinner.\nKissing: A brother and sister like to kiss\neach other on the mouth. When nobody is around, they find a secret\nhiding place and kiss each other on the mouth, passionately.\n\n\nAnother vignette that Haidt used has become quite famous:\n\nChicken: A man goes to the supermarket\nonce a week and buys a dead chicken. But before cooking the chicken,\nhe has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks it and eats it.\n(Haidt, Koller, & Dias 1993: 617)\n\n\nAfter each vignette, rather than simply assuming that participants\nbelieved the actions described to be harmless, Haidt asked, \u201cIs\nanyone hurt by what [the actor] did? Who? How?\u201d (Haidt, Koller,\n& Dias 1993: 617).\n\nSince Haidt was interested in Shweder\u2019s claim that the moral\ndomain was much larger for people in non-Western societies, his study\nwas designed to compare the judgments of participants near his own\nuniversity, in Philadelphia, with those of participants in two\nBrazilian cities\u2014Porto Alegre, in the south, which was\nindustrialized, westernized, and relatively wealthy, and Recife, in\nthe north, which was much poorer, less industrialized, and less\nwesternized. As Shweder would have predicted, Haidt found that\nparticipants in Recife were more likely than participants in\nPhiladelphia to view behaviors like those in\n Dog,\n Kissing, and\n Chicken\n as moral transgressions, using Haidt\u2019s version of the questions\nintended to determine whether a participant regarded a transgression\nas moral or conventional. Participants in Porto Alegre were in between\nthe two. But there was also a surprise in the data. Haidt and\ncolleagues had collected information about the socio-economic status\n(SES) of their participants, and they found that lower SES groups\n\u201cmoralized\u201d more than higher SES groups in all three\ncities, and that the effect of SES was much larger than the effect of\nlocation.\n\nHaidt\u2019s study posed an important and influential challenge to\nTuriel\u2019s harm-anchored definition of morality. But it was not\nwithout problems. In constructing the questions they would use to\ndetermine whether participants regarded a judgment to be moral or\nconventional, Shweder and colleagues had included a question about\npunishment:\n\n\nDo you think a person who does (the practice under\nconsideration) should be stopped from doing that or punished in\nsome way? (Shweder, Mahapatra, & Miller 1987: 42)\n\n\nAnd Haidt retained a version of the punishment question in his study:\n\u201cShould [the actor] be stopped or punished in any way?\u201d\n(Haidt, Koller, & Dias 1993: 617). However, though Turiel and his\ncolleagues sometimes collect judgments about punishment, they\nexplicitly reject their use in assessing whether participants view a\ntransgression as moral or conventional, since both moral and\nconventional transgressions are often punished. Smetana, Rote, et al.\n(2012: 683) insist that judgments about punishment \u201care not a\nformal criterion for differentiating the domains\u201d. And Smetana,\nJambon, and Ball (2018) tell us that while they\n\n\ncommonly assess children\u2019s judgments of \u2026 the degree of\ncensure that the transgressor deserves,\u2026. these evaluations are\nless informative than criterion judgments because all rule violations\nare, by definition, unacceptable, wrong, and punishable. (2018:\n270)\n\n\nThe other question Haidt asked in his pared down version of queries\nintended to determine whether participants regarded a judgment as\nmoral was aimed at assessing whether participants generalized their\njudgment:\n\n\nSuppose you learn about two different foreign countries. In country A\npeople [do that act] very often, and in country B, they never [do that\nact]. Are both of these customs OK, or is one of them bad or wrong?\n(Haidt, Koller, & Dias 1993: 617)\n\n\nSince Turiel\u2019s version of the criterion judgment questions also\nincludes one or more questions aimed at determining whether\nparticipants view their judgment to be authority dependent or\nauthority independent, it is not clear that Haidt\u2019s two probes\n(or the questions that Shweder used) constitute a fair test of the\nhypothesis that the transgressions evoking the moral pattern of\ncriterion judgments all involve harm.\n\nDuring the last three decades, there have been a number of studies\nthat cleaved more closely to the authority independence and\ngeneralization criterion judgments advocated by Turiel and his\nassociates and explored the sorts of transgressions that evoked those\njudgments in a variety of religions groups and a variety of cultural\n settings.[16]\n Most of the studies undertaken by Turiel and researchers associated\nwith him used intuitive moral transgressions that seemed (to\ncontemporary Western observers) to be obviously harmful, and intuitive\nconventional transgressions that seemed (again, to contemporary\nWestern observers) to obviously not be harmful. These studies confirm\nthe prediction that transgressions that evoke moral criterion\njudgments are harmful and transgressions that don\u2019t evoke moral\ncriterion judgments aren\u2019t. But none of these studies are\nproblem free. None of them follow Haidt\u2019s lead and actually\nask participants whether the transgressive behavior is\nharmful. Also most of the transgressions used in these studies are of\nthe tame \u201cschoolyard\u201d variety that can be comfortably used\nwith children. None of these studies used anything like the more\nflamboyant \u201charmless taboo violations\u201d that were center\nstage in Haidt\u2019s study. So we do not know whether people in\nthese cultures and religious groups would offer moral or conventional\ncriterion judgments in response to transgressions like the ones that\nHaidt used.\n\nBy contrast, two recent studies by Berni\u016bnas and his colleagues\n(2016, 2020) did use Haidt-style transgressions, including eating a\npet dog who has been run over, using the national flag to clean the\ntoilet, and defecating in a Buddhist temple. They also followed Haidt\nin explicitly asking whether anyone was harmed by these actions. But,\nunlike Haidt, they solicited Turiel-style criterion judgments using\nquestions that cleaved quite closely to those used by Turiel and other\nsocial domain theorists. They found that many of the transgressions\nthat the participants themselves characterized as harmless evinced\nmoral rather than conventional criterion\njudgments.\n\nOverall, the bottom line is that on the question of whether\nTuriel\u2019s hypothesis about the definition of morality applies\ncross-culturally, the jury is still out. Many of the earlier studies\nconfront serious methodological issues. And while the two recent\nstudies, by Berni\u016bnas and colleagues, that avoid earlier\nmethodological problems report findings that challenge Turiel\u2019s\ndefinition, much more methodologically fastidious research is\nneeded.\n",
