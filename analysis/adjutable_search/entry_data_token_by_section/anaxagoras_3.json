    "main_text": "Metaphysical Principles || Everything-in-Everything\n2.2 Everything-in-Everything\n\n\n\n\u201cAll things were together.\u201d B1 (in part)\n\n\n\u201cIn everything there is a share of everything.\u201d B11 (in\npart)\n\n\n\nAs we have seen, Anaxagoras\u2019 commitment to Eleatic principles rules\nout the possibility of genuine coming-to-be or passing-away. It also\nrules out real qualitative changes and transformations. When a warm\nliquid cools (it seems) the hot liquid becomes cold; when a child\ningests food (milk and bread, for instance), the milk and bread are\n(it seems) transformed into flesh, blood, and bone. Yet Anaxagoras\nobjects to these claims because they entail that the hot ceases to be,\nand the cold comes to be, in the liquid, and that the bread and milk\nare destroyed while flesh, blood, and bone come to be. His solution is\nto claim not only that \u201call things were together\u201d in the\noriginal mixture, but that everything is in everything at all\ntimes. If there is already blood and bone in the milk and bread, then\nthe growth of the child can be attributed to the accumulation of these\ningredients from the bread and milk, and their assimilation into the\nsubstance of the child\u2019s body, rather than to the transformation of\nbread and milk into something else. Further, if there are both hot and\ncold in the liquid, there is no disappearance into nothing of the hot\nas the liquid cools, and no generation of the cold from what is not\n(or even from what is not cold). The clearest statement of this is in\nAnaxagoras B10, a quotation found in the following passage:\n\n\nWhen Anaxagoras discovered the old belief that nothing comes from\nthat which is not in any way whatsoever, he did away with coming-to-be,\nand introduced dissociation in place of coming-to-be. For he\nfoolishly said that all things are mixed with each other, but that as\nthey grow they are dissociated. For in the same seminal fluid\nthere are hair, nails, veins and arteries, sinew, and bone, and it\nhappens that they are imperceptible because of the smallness of the\nparts, but when they grow, they gradually are separated off.\n\u201cFor how,\u201d he says, \u201ccan hair come from what is not\nhair, and flesh from what is not flesh?\u201d He maintained\nthis, not only about bodies, but also about colors. For he said\nthat black is in white and white in black. And he laid down the\nsame thing with respect to weights, believing that light is mixed with\nheavy and vice versa. (DK 59 B10; the passage is from the\nanonymous scholiast on a 4th c. C.E. work of Gregory\nof\n Nazianzus.[2])\n\n\nAlthough interpreters both ancient (including this scholiast and\nSimplicius) and modern (Guthrie 1965 is a good example) have seen\nthe desire to explain nutrition and growth as the primary\nmotivation for adopting the Everything-in-Everything principle, it is more\nlikely that Anaxagoras\u2019 adoption of the general metaphysical\nprinciple of No-Becoming leads him to claim that everything is in\neverything (Schofield 1981, Curd 2007). Nutrition and growth are simply particularly clear instances of the changes\nthat are ruled out as fundamentally real if there is no becoming.\n\n\nThe Everything-in-Everything principle asserts the omnipresence of\ningredients. In everything there is a mixture of all the ingredients\nthat there are: every ingredient is everywhere at all times. This\nprinciple is a fundamental tenet of Anaxagoras\u2019 theory, and leads to\ndifficulties of interpretation (see, for instance, the debate between\nMathews 2002 and 2005 and Sisko 2005). If everything is in everything,\nthere must be interpenetration of ingredients, for it must be possible\nfor there to be many ingredients in the same space.  Indeed, the\nprinciple requires that all ingredients be in every space at all times\n(the No Smallest or Largest principle also plays a role here: see\nsect. 2.3). This will allow any ingredient to emerge from a mixture\nthrough accumulation (or, having been unmixed, to become submerged in\none) at any point at any time, and thus allow for the appearance of\ncoming-to-be (or passing-away) of things or qualities.\n\n\nSome scholars have supposed that Anaxagoras thought of these\ningredients as very small particles (Vlastos 1950, Guthrie 1965, Sider\n2005, Lewis 2000). But a particle would have to be a smallest\namount of some type of ingredient, occupying some space all by\nitself\u2014with no other type of ingredient in it. Not only\ndoes the No Smallest or Largest principle rule this out (see sect.\n2.3), but the particulate interpretation seems inconsistent with the\nEverything-in-Everything principle. It is crucial to\nAnaxagoras\u2019 theory that there be (in actuality) no such pure bits\nor volumes of any type of ingredient.\n\n\nInstead one might conceive of the ingredients as fluid, like pastes or\nliquids which can be smeared together, with different areas of the\nmixture characterized by different relative densities of the\ningredients, all of which are nevertheless everywhere in it. Each\ngenuinely real ingredient could be mixed with every other, and so\nwould be contained in any area of the mixture, and in principle\nvisibly recoverable from it by accumulation or increased\nconcentration.  The differing densities of the ingredients would allow\nfor differences in the phenomenal character of the mixture. To an\nobserver, different areas would appear hotter or colder, sweeter or\nmore bitter, more red than green, and so on, and rightly so. As the\nrelative concentration of ingredients in any area of the mixture\naltered (through the mixture and separation brought about by the\nrotation of the original blend of ingredients), the phenomenal\ncharacter of that region of the mixture would alter. An\nintriguing account (Marmodoro 2015, 2017) suggests that Anaxagorean\ningredients are not material; rather they are primitive physical\nqualitative powers or dispositions (in the parlance of contemporary\nmetaphysics, they are \u201cgunky\u201d). \n",
