    "main_text": "Cultural Politics || Public and Private\n3.4 Public and Private\n\nRorty\u2019s version of liberalism is expressed also in the\ndistinction he draws between the private and the public (CIS). This\ndistinction is often misinterpreted to imply that certain domains of\ninteraction or behavior should be exempted from evaluation in moral or\npolitical or social terms. The distinction Rorty draws, however, has\nlittle to do with traditional attempts to draw lines of demarcation of\nthis sort between a private and a public domain \u2013 to determine\nwhich aspects of our lives we do and which we don\u2019t have to\nanswer for publicly. Rorty\u2019s distinction, rather, goes to the\npurposes of theoretical vocabularies. We should, Rorty urges, be\n\u201ccontent to treat the demands of self-creation and of human\nsolidarity as equally valid, yet forever incommensurable\u201d (CIS,\nxv). Rorty\u2019s view is that we should treat vocabularies for\ndeliberation about public goods and social and political arrangements,\non the one hand, and vocabularies developed or created in pursuit of\npersonal fulfilment, self-creation, and self-realization, on the\nother, as distinct tools. The attempt to bring them together, in an\noverarching theory, is part of what has led philosophy to pursue\nprojects that have exceeded their usefulness.\n\nRorty\u2019s distinction between public and private is personified in\nthe figure of the liberal ironist (CIS, chapter 4). She is a person\nwho recognizes that her final vocabulary can be split into two parts,\nwhere the public part of her final vocabulary has to do with her\nresponsibilities to others (justice), and the private part of her\nfinal vocabulary has to do with her responsibilities to herself\n(self-creation). Arguably, the liberal ironist is the type of person\nRorty himself aspired to be, as evidenced by his autobiographical\nessay, \u201cTrotsky and the Wild Orchids\u201d (in PSH). There, he\nadmits that much of his early philosophical career had been an attempt\nto reconcile public and private, but he \u201cgradually decided that\nthe whole idea of holding reality and justice in a single vision had\nbeen a mistake\u201d (PSH, 12).\n\nCritics have often worried that Rorty\u2019s line between public and\nprivate simply reinscribes one of the most problematic features of\nliberalism. However, the line Rorty draws between public and private\nis necessarily porous; it is in part because of the move of private\nvocabularies to the public realm that social progress occurs.\n",
