    "main_text": "Five Problems || The epistemological problem of mathematics\n2.1 The epistemological problem of mathematics\nGiven that platonism postulates the existence of mathematical\nobjects, the question arises as to how we obtain knowledge about\nthem. The epistemological problem of mathematics is the problem of\nexplaining the possibility of mathematical knowledge, given that\nmathematical objects themselves do not seem to play any role in\ngenerating our mathematical beliefs (Field 1989).\nThis is taken to be a particular problem for platonism, since this\nview postulates the existence of mathematical objects, and one would\nexpect such objects to play a role in the acquisition of mathematical\nknowledge. After all, on the platonist view, such knowledge is about\nthe corresponding mathematical objects. However, despite various\nsophisticated attempts by platonists, there is still considerable\ncontroversy as to how exactly this process should be\narticulated. Should it be understood via mathematical intuition, by\nthe introduction of suitable mathematical principles and definitions,\nor does it require some form of abstraction?\nIn turn, the epistemological issue is far less problematic for\nnominalists, who are not committed to the existence of mathematical\nobjects in the first place. They will have to explain other things,\nsuch as, how can the nominalist account for the difference between a\nmathematician, who knows a significant amount of mathematics, and a\nnon-mathematician, who does not? This difference, according to some\nnominalists, is based on empirical and logical knowledge\u2014not on\nmathematical knowledge (Field 1989).\n",
