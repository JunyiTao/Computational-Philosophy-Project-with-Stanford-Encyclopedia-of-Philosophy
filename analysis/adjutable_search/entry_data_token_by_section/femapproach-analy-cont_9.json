    "main_text": "Epistemic Injustice || Conclusion\n3.3 Conclusion\n\nThe concept of epistemic injustice has proved a fruitful one for\nfeminists, as for critical race theorists, disability theorists and\nothers. Those in the analytic tradition have focused on mapping its\ncontours, nailing down the precise form of injustice it involves and\nexposing forms of socially positioned ignorance in which dominant\ngroups continue to misapprehend the world. Those in the Continental\ntradition conceive of such ignorance as ideology and, like those in\nthe analytic tradition, understand it as a mechanism of both\ndistortion and silencing. They have also probed the conditions for\nforms of public communication and discourse free of coercion. Moving\non from Fricker\u2019s work, feminists in both analytic and\nContinental traditions remain interested in expanding the concept of\nepistemic injustice beyond dyadic relations to examine its systemic\nreach and consequences.\n4. General Conclusion\n\nAnalytic and Continental feminists share interests in avoiding\nexclusion in attempts to define women, in overcoming patriarchal forms\nof oppression and in securing the claims of women to know and to\nparticipate in epistemic projects. Analytic and continental feminists\nsometimes pursue these interests in different ways, sometimes in\nsimilar ways and sometimes in conversation with one another.\nCollectively they take up and further develop a rich history of\nliberal, Marxist, post-structuralist, hermeneutic and linguistic\nthought.",
