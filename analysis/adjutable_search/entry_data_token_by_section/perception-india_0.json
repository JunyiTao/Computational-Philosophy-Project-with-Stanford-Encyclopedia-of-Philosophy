    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe etymology of perception in Sanskrit underlines a major and,\nperhaps the most controversial, issue in classical Indian\nepistemology, viz. is the sensory core all there is to the\ncontent of a perceptual experience? Put differently, it is asked\nwhether the content of a perceptual experience is restricted\nto being unconceptualized (nirvikalpaka), or can any part of\nit be conceptualized (savikalpaka) as well? The\nNaiy\u0101yikas generally take perception to be a two-staged process:\nfirst there arises a non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception\nof the object and then a conceptual (savikalpaka) perception,\nboth being valid cognitions. For Buddhists, non-conceptual perceptions\nalone are valid, while Grammarians (\u015a\u0101bdikas) deny their\nvalidity altogether. S\u0101\u1e43khya and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 agree with the Ny\u0101ya position. These\ntwo realist schools, Ny\u0101ya and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\ncontest the Grammarian as well as the Buddhist positions. Advaita\nVed\u0101nta position on perception seems to agree, in spirit, with\nthe Buddhists, but their reasons for supporting non-conceptual\nperceptions alone as ultimately valid (param\u0101rthika\nsatta) are very different. This debate, on the role of concepts\nin perception, is discussed in detail in section 3.\n\nYet another debate about the nature of universals and concepts looms\nin the background of this debate. How do we know universals or\nconcepts? The Buddhist introduce the doctrine of apoha to provide the\nresources for constructing concepts from sensory content to further\nthe nominalist project of explaining thought and language in a world\nof particulars. In response to Buddhist nominalism, Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers present a defense of realism in the course of which they\nargue for a theory of real perceivable universals. This debate will be\nthe focus of secion 4.\n\nA very critical question germane to these epistemological issues is\nraised by the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu (c. 4th century CE): how\ndo we distinguish veridical perceptions from the non-veridical ones?\nThis is taken up in the last section.\n\nBefore we start out with the definitions, the following observation\nmay be noted. It is true that the classical Indian philosophers were\nseriously concerned with the notions of enlightenment, the highest\ngood, freedom from the cycle of rebirth and the attainment of ultimate\nbliss, etc. Therefore, some even question whether they were concerned\nwith any epistemological questions at all, much less the ones raised\nhere? But they were! For Naiy\u0101yikas, in particular, this was a\nmajor focus: the reason offered in the early Ny\u0101ya tradition, in\nV\u0101tsy\u0101yana\u2019s (c. 450\u2013500 CE) commentary on the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra, is that without knowledge of objects\nthere is no success in practical response to them. Not very\nenlightening, perhaps. However, a much sharper justification comes\nfrom Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba (c. 12th century CE), the founder of the\nNavya-Ny\u0101ya school, in the introduction to his great work,\nJewel Of Reflection On The Truth\n(Tattvacint\u0101ma\u1e47i):\n\nIn order that discerning persons may have interest in studying the\nwork, Ak\u1e63ap\u0101da Gautama (c. 2nd century CE) laid down the\ns\u016btra: \u2018Attainment of the highest good comes from\nright knowledge.\u2019.\n\n\nIt should not then be surprising that one of the most sophisticated\nclassical Indian treatises dealing with perception,\nKum\u0101rila\u2019s (c. 7th  century CE)\nPratyak\u1e63apariccheda (a portion of\n\u015alokav\u0101rttika pertaining to the fourth\ns\u016btra of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra), discusses the\nnature and validity of perception without any consideration of its\nrole in the ascertainment of religious and moral truth; in fact, the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra itself characterizes\nperception as not being a means of knowing righteousness\n(Dharma). It is true that epistemological debates in\nclassical Indian philosophy arose in the religio-philosophical\ncontext; however, there is plenty of evidence on record to show that\nclassical Indian philosophers were haunted by the very same\nepistemological concerns that have troubled the minds of Western\nphilosophers through the ages. The controversial classical Indian\nepistemology issue\u2014whether perception is conceptualized or\nnot?\u2014continues to be debated in the Western and Indian\nphilosophy journals even today. That said, what makes this historical\ninquiry significant is that the epistemological issues in classical\nIndian philosophy are introduced against the backdrop of radically\ndifferent metaphysical and ethical presuppositions.\n",
