    "main_text": "The Epistemological Organization of Developmental Biology || No Theory of Development?\n2.1 No Theory of Development?\n\nAlthough it is common in philosophy to associate sciences with\ntheories, such that the individuation of a science is dependent on a\nconstitutive theory or group of models, it is uncommon to find\npresentations of developmental biology that make reference to a\ntheory of development (see discussion in Minelli and Pradeu\n2014). Instead, we find references to families of approaches\n(developmental genetics, experimental embryology, cell biology, and\n molecular biology)\n or catalogues of \u201ckey molecular components\u201d\n(transcription factor families, inducing factor families, cytoskeleton\nor cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components). No\nstandard theory or group of models provides theoretical scaffolding in\nthe major textbooks (e.g., Slack 2013; Wolpert et al. 2010; Gilbert\n2010). The absence of any reference to a constitutive theory of\ndevelopment or some set of core explanatory models is prima\nfacie puzzling. Three interpretations of this situation are\npossible: (a) despite the lack of reference to theories, one can\nreconstruct a theory (or theories) of developmental biology out of the\nrelevant discourse (e.g., multiple allied molecular models); (b) the\nlack of reference to theories indicates an immaturity in developmental\nbiology because mature sciences always have systematic theories; and,\n(c) the lack of reference to theories should be taken at face\nvalue.\n\nDevelopmental biology is not an immature science, groping about for\nsome way to explain its phenomena: \u201csome of the basic processes\nand mechanisms of embryonic development are now quite well\nunderstood\u201d (Slack 2013: 7). The impetus for this type of\ninterpretation arises out of commitments to a conception of mature\nscience that presumes theories are abstract systems with a small set\nof laws or core principles (see the entry on\n the structure of scientific theories).\n On the other hand, holding that developmental biology already has a\ntheory costumed in different guise\u2014not referred to as such by\ndevelopmental biologists\u2014is a possible interpretation. It arises\nout of a view that sciences must have theories, which has been\nexpanded to allow for different understandings of theory structure,\nsuch as constellations of models without laws, even though the\nassumption is that theory still plays a similar organizing role in\nguiding research. However, this assumption should be challenged and\nrejected on methodological grounds in the case of developmental\nbiology. An analysis of the reasoning in a science should exhibit\nepistemic transparency and not postulate \u201chidden\u201d\nreasoning structure (Love 2012). This criterion is based on the\npremise that the basis of successes in scientific inquiry must be\navailable to those engaged in its practice (i.e., scientists). If we\npostulate hidden structure not present in scientific discourse to\naccount for inductive inference, explanation, or other forms of\nreasoning, then we risk obscuring how scientists themselves access\nthis structure to evaluate it (Woodward 2003: ch. 4). The successes of\ndevelopmental biology would become mysterious when viewed from the\nvantage point of its participants.\n\nEpistemic transparency demands a descriptive correspondence between\nphilosophical accounts of science and scientific practice. This does\nnot mean that every claim made by any scientist should be taken with\nthe same credence. A ruling concern is pervasive features of practice.\nThe problem with assuming laws are required for explanation is their\nrelative absence from a variety of successful sciences routinely\noffering explanations, not that no scientist ever appeals to laws as\nexplanatory. Pervasive features of scientific practice should be\nprominent in philosophical accounts of sciences. Thus, it is not\nsurprising that the desire for a theory can be found among some\ndevelopmental biologists: \u201cDeveloping a theory is of utmost\nimportance for any discipline\u201d (Sommer 2009: 417). But the fact\nthat these calls are rare means we should not assume theories are\nactually needed to govern and organize inquiry within the\n domain.[4]\n\nIt was once thought that each science must have laws in order to offer\nexplanations (see the entry on\n scientific explanations),\n but now this is seen as unnecessary (Giere 1999; Woodward 2003). The\nexpectation that a science have a theory to accomplish the task of\norganizing and guiding inquiry is of similar vintage. It derives from\nan intuitive expectation of what counts as a mature science in the\nfirst place. Even if we find empirically successful and coherent\ntraditions of research without a systematic theoretical framework\nproviding guidance, then the science cannot be mature. One might shrug\noff these quasi-positivist appeals to maturity by invoking more\nflexible conceptions of theory and theory structure. But why retain\nthe expectation that theories should accomplish the same epistemic\ntasks? It is a preconception about knowledge structure that is not\nplausible in light of the diversity of research practices found across\nthe sciences. The few scientists who favor this philosophical response\nhave different motivations. Instead of maturity, other reasons are\nsalient, such as guidance in the face of a welter of biochemical\ndetail or the need to forge a synthesis between evolution and\n development.[5]\n\nDevelopmental biologists recognize that the \u201ccurse of\ndetail\u201d is one of the costs of developmental biology\u2019s\nmeteoric success over the past three decades: \u201cThe principal\nchallenge today is that of exponentially increasing detail\u201d\n(Slack 2013: ix). While something must provide organization and\nguidance to developmental biology, it need not be theories that\naccomplish the task. Regarding calls for a synthesis of evolution and\ndevelopment, these often assume that having a developmental theory is\na precondition for synthesis (Sommer 2009): \u201cOur troubles\n\u2026 derive from our standing lack of an explicit theory of\ndevelopment\u201d (Minelli 2011a: 4). However, this line of argument\nrelies on the degree to which evolutionary theory exhibits the\nsupposed structure to which developmental biologists should aspire.\nThe actual practice associated with evolutionary theory indicates a\nmore flexible framework with chameleon qualities that is responsively\nadjusted to the diverse investigative aims of evolutionary researchers\n(Love 2013). Therefore, it is not clear that evolutionary theory\nsupplies the preferred template. A productive way forward is to\nrelinquish the prior expectation that sciences must have theories of a\ncertain kind to govern and guide their activity. Instead, sciences\nthat display empirical success and fecundity should be studied to\ndiscover what features are responsible, without assuming that those\nfeatures will be the same for all sciences: \u201cScience need not be\nunderstood in these terms and, indeed, may be better understood in\nother terms\u201d (Giere 1999: 4).\n",
