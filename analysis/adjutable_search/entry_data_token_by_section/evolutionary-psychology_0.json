Evolutionary Psychology: One research tradition among the various biological approaches to explaining human behavior\n\nThis entry focuses on the specific approach to evolutionary psychology\nthat is conventionally named by the capitalized phrase\n\u201cEvolutionary Psychology\u201d. This naming convention is David\nBuller\u2019s (2000; 2005) idea. He introduces the convention to\ndistinguish a particular research tradition (Laudan 1977) from other\napproaches to the biology of human\n behavior.[1]\n This research tradition is the focus here but lower case is used\nthroughout as no other types of evolutionary psychology are discussed.\nEvolutionary psychology rests upon specific theoretical principles\n(presented in section 2 below) not all of which are shared by others\nworking in the biology of human behavior (Laland and Brown 2002; Brown\net al. 2011). For example, human behavioral ecologists present and\ndefend explanatory hypotheses about human behavior that do not appeal\nto psychological mechanisms (e.g., Hawkes 1990; Hrdy 1999). Behavioral\necologists also believe that much of human behavior can be explained\nby appealing to evolution while rejecting the idea held by\nevolutionary psychologists that one period of our evolutionary history\nis the source of all our important psychological adaptations (Irons\n1998). Developmental psychobiologists take yet another approach: they\nare anti-adaptationist. (Michel and Moore 1995; but see Bateson and\nMartin 1999; Bjorklund and Hernandez Blasi 2005 for examples of\ndevelopmentalist work in an adaptationist vein.) These theorists\nbelieve that much of our behavior can be explained without appealing\nto a suite of specific psychological adaptations for that behavior.\nInstead they emphasize the role of development in the production of\nvarious human behavioral traits. From here on, \u201cevolutionary\npsychology\u201d refers to a specific research tradition among the\nmany biological approaches to the study of human behavior.\n\nPaul Griffiths argues that evolutionary psychology owes theoretical\ndebt to both sociobiology and ethology (Griffiths 2006; Griffiths\n2008). Evolutionary psychologists acknowledge their debt to\nsociobiology but point out that they add a dimension to sociobiology:\npsychological mechanisms. Human behaviors are not a direct product of\nnatural selection but rather the product of psychological mechanisms\nthat were selected for. The relation to ethology here is that in the\nnineteen fifties, ethologists proposed instincts or drives that\nunderlie our\n behavior;[2]\n evolutionary psychology\u2019s psychological mechanisms are the\ncorrelates to instincts or drives. Evolutionary psychology is also\nrelated to cognitive psychology and the cognitive sciences. The\npsychological mechanisms they invoke are computational, sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cDarwinian algorithms\u201d or as\n\u201ccomputational modules\u201d. This overt cognitivism sets\nevolutionary psychology apart from much work in the neurosciences and\nfrom behavioral neuroendocrinology. In these fields internal\nmechanisms are proposed in explanations of human behavior but they are\nnot construed in computational terms. David Marr\u2019s (e.g., 1983)\nwell known three part distinction is often invoked to distinguish the\nlevels at which researchers focus their attention in the cognitive and\nneurosciences. Many neuroscientists and behavioral\nneuroendocrinologists work at the implementation level while cognitive\npsychologists work at the level of the computations that are\nimplemented at the neurobiological level (cf. Griffiths 2006).\n\nEvolutionary psychologists sometimes present their approach as\npotentially unifying, or providing a foundation for, all other work\nthat purports to explain human behavior (e.g., Tooby and Cosmides\n1992). This claim has been met with strong skepticism by many social\nscientists who see a role for a myriad of types of explanation of\nhuman behavior, some of which are not reducible to biological\nexplanations of any sort. This discussion hangs on issues of\nreductionism in the social sciences. (Little 1991 has a nice\nintroduction to these issues.) There are also reasons to believe that\nevolutionary psychology neither unifies nor provides foundations for\nclosely neighboring fields such as behavioral ecology or developmental\npsychobiology. (See the related discussion in Downes 2005.) In other\nwork, evolutionary psychologists present their approach as being\nconsistent with or compatible with neighboring approaches such as\nbehavioral ecology and developmental psychobiology. (See Buss\u2019s\nintroduction to Buss 2005.) The truth of this claim hangs on a careful\nexamination of the theoretical tenets of evolutionary psychology and\nits neighboring fields. We now turn to evolutionary psychology\u2019s\ntheoretical tenets and revisit this discussion in section 4 below.\n",
