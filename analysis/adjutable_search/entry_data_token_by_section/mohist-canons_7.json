    "main_text": "Philosophy of Language\n4. Philosophy of Language\n\nThe later Mohists develop a sophisticated naturalistic semantic theory\nthat explains reference, and thus communication, by appeal to\nspeakers\u2019 shared capacity to learn to distinguish different\nkinds of things on the basis of their characteristic features. As in\nthe Analects, the other parts of the Mozi, and the\nXunzi, theoretical attention focuses on the issue of applying\nnames or terms to things correctly, and not on the structure or truth\nof sentences. (The \u201cLesser Selection\u201d moves on to consider\n\u201cexpressions\u201d (c\u00ed \u8fad) formed of\nstrings of words, but these are treated along the same lines as\nterms.) Unlike traditional Western theories of language, such as\nLockean conceptualism, the Mohists do not explain the relation between\nlanguage and the world by appeal to mental ideas or meanings that\nwords stand for. Instead, speakers are understood to communicate by\nmastering practices for distinguishing (bi\u00e0n \u8faf)\nthe referents of names for various kinds of things. By virtue of these\npractices, members of the same language community know that each\ngeneral term stands for all similar things of a certain kind\n(l\u00e8i \u985e). \n",
