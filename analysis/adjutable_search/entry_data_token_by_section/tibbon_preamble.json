    "main_text": "\n\n\nSamuel Ibn Tibbon (c. 1165\u20131232) was a translator, philosopher,\nand philosophical commentator on the Bible. He is most famous for his\ntranslation of Maimonides\u2019 Guide of the Perplexed from\nArabic into Hebrew, but he translated other works by Maimonides, and\nproduced the first Hebrew versions of Aristotle and Averroes. In\naddition to his work as translator, Ibn Tibbon was an original\nauthor in his own right. He wrote the first full Aristotelian/Maimonidean\nexplication of the biblical book Ecclesiastes, a\nphilosophical-exegetical monograph entitled Ma\u2019amar Yiqqawu\nha-Mayim, and several smaller philosophical-exegetical treatises\nand epistles. His work was especially important in his native southern\nFrance (\u201cProvence\u201d), but he had significant influence also\non Jewish philosophy and exegesis in Italy, Byzantium, and Spain, through the\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. He is rightfully\nconsidered the founder of Maimonideanism, a philosophical-exegetical\nmovement in medieval Judaism.\n\n",
