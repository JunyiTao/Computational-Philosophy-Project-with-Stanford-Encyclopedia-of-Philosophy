    "main_text": "Arendt\u2019s Theory of Judgment || Judgment: Two Models\n5.1 Judgment: Two Models\n\n\nArendt\u2019s theory of judgment was never developed as systematically or\nextensively as her theory of action. She intended to complete her\nstudy of the life of the mind by devoting the third volume to the\nfaculty of judgment, but was not able to do so because of her untimely\ndeath in 1975. What she left was a number of reflections scattered in\nthe first two volumes on Thinking and Willing (LM,\nvol. I; vol. II), a series of lectures on Kant\u2019s political philosophy\ndelivered at the New School for Social Research in the Fall of 1970\n(LKPP), an essay entitled \u201cThinking and Moral\nConsiderations\u201d written at the time she was composing The\nLife of the Mind (TMC, 417\u201346), and two articles included in\nBetween Past and Future where judgment and opinion are\ntreated in relation to culture and taste (\u201cThe Crisis in\nCulture\u201d \u2013 BPF, 197\u2013226) and with respect to the question\nof truth (\u201cTruth and Politics\u201d \u2013 BPF,\n227\u201364). However, these writings do not present a unified theory of\njudgment but, rather, two distinct models, one based on the standpoint\nof the actor, the other on the standpoint of the spectator, which are\nsomewhat at odds with each other. Arendt\u2019s writings on the theme of\njudgment can be seen to fall into two more or less distinct phases, an\nearly one in which judgment is the faculty of political actors acting\nin the public realm, and a later one in which it is the privilege of\nnon-participating spectators, primarily poets and historians, who seek\nto understand the meaning of the past and to reconcile us to what has\nhappened. In this later formulation Arendt is no longer concerned with\njudging as a feature of political life as such, as the faculty which\nis exercised by actors in order to decide how to act in the public\nrealm, but with judgment as a component in the life of the mind, the\nfaculty through which the privileged spectators can recover meaning\nfrom the past and thereby reconcile themselves to time and,\nretrospectively, to tragedy.\n\n\nIn addition to presenting us with two models of judgment which stand\nin tension with each other, Arendt did not clarify the status of\njudgment with respect to two of its philosophical sources, Aristotle\nand Kant. The two conceptions seem to pull in opposite directions, the\nAristotelian toward a concern with the particular, the Kantian toward\na concern with universality and impartiality.\n\n It would appear, therefore, that Arendt\u2019s theory of judgment not only\nincorporates two models, the actor\u2019s \u2014 judging in order to act\n\u2014 and the spectator\u2019s \u2014 judging in order to cull meaning\nfrom the past \u2014 but that the philosophical sources it draws upon\nare somewhat at odds with each other.\n",
