Immorality and moral responsibility in dreams\n\nHow the phenomenology of dreaming compares to waking and what to say\nabout how the dream self relates to the waking self bears on questions\nabout the moral status of dreams. For Augustine (Confessions)\ndreams were a cause of moral concern because of their\nindistinguishability from waking life. What particularly worried him\nabout dreams of sexual acts was their vividness, as well as the\nfeeling of pleasure and seeming acquiescence or consent on the part of\nthe dreamer. He concluded, however, that the transition from sleep to\nwakefulness involves a radical chasm, enabling the dreamer to awaken\nwith a clear conscience and absolving them from taking responsibility\nfor their dream actions.\n\nWhat exactly Augustine thought the chasm between dreaming and waking\nconsists in allows for different interpretations (Matthews 1981).\nFirstly, if the dream and waking self are not identical, then waking\nAugustine is not morally responsible for dream-Augustine\u2019s\nactions. Secondly, actions performed in dreams might be morally\nirrelevant because they did not really happen. And thirdly, assuming\nthat moral responsibility requires the ability to act otherwise,\ndreams provide no grounds for moral concern because we cannot refrain\nfrom having certain types of dreams.\n\nThe issue of dream immorality may also present a choice point between\ndifferent accounts of moral evaluation. Where internalists assume the\nmoral status of a person\u2019s actions is entirely determined by internal\nfactors such as intentions and motives, externalists look beyond these\nto the effects of actions. Driver (2007) argues that the absurdity of\ndream immorality itself should count against purely internalist\naccounts; yet she also acknowledges this absurdity is not a necessary\nfeature of dreams.\n\nCentral to the question of dream immorality is the status of dreams as\nactions rather than mere behaviors. Mullane (1965) argues that while\nwe don\u2019t have full control over our dreams, they are not\ncompletely involuntary either; as is the case for blushing,\nconsiderable effort is required to attain control over our dreams and\nin some cases they can even be considered as actions. That lucid dream\ncontrol is, to some extent, a learnable skill (Stumbrys et al. 2014)\nlends some support to this claim.\n",
