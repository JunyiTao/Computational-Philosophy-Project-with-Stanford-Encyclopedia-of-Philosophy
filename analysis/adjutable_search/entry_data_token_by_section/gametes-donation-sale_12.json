    "main_text": "Donor Matching and Selection\n3. Donor Matching and Selection\n\nRecipients of donated gametes often wish to have some say in what\ntheir donor is \u2018like\u2019. The characteristics made available\nto inform donor selection decisions differ greatly dependent on both\nthe countries and clinics in which such choices are made. However,\nsuch information tends to include medical, morphological, and\nbiographical information similar to that found on dating websites,\nsuch as hair colour, eye colour, ethnicity, educational attainment,\njob type, hobbies, and religion.\n\nFew commentators suggest that recipient-parents should be barred\ncompletely from accessing information about prospective donors, but\nneither is it generally assumed that they should be afforded\nunfettered liberty to choose their donors\u2019 characteristics.\nThus, the debate in this area tends to focus on where the line between\nmorally acceptable and unacceptable selection practices lies.\n",
