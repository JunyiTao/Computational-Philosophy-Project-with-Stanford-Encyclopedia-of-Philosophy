    "main_text": "Arthur N. Prior and hybrid logic\n4. Arthur N. Prior and hybrid logic\n\nThe history of hybrid logic goes back to Arthur N. Prior\u2019s\nhybrid tense logic, which is a hybridized version of ordinary tense\nlogic. With the aim of investigating this further, we shall give a\nformal definition of hybrid tense logic. The language of hybrid tense\nlogic is simply the language of hybrid logic defined above except that\nthere are two modal operators, namely \\(\\mathtt{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{H}\\), instead of the single modal operator\n\\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\). The two new modal operators are called tense\noperators. The semantics of hybrid tense logic is the semantics\nof hybrid logic, cf. earlier, with the clause for \\(\\mathtt{\\Box}\\)\nreplaced by clauses for the tense operators \\(\\mathtt{G}\\) and\n\\(\\mathtt{H}\\).\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{G \\phi}\\) iff for any element \\(v\\) of \\(W\\)\nsuch that \\(wRv\\), it is the case that \\(M, g, v \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\\(M, g, w \\vDash \\mathtt{H \\phi}\\) iff for any element \\(v\\) of \\(W\\)\nsuch that \\(vRw\\), it is the case that \\(M, g, v \\vDash\n\\mathtt{\\phi}\\)\n\n\nThus, there are now two modal operators, namely one that \u201clooks\nforwards\u201d along the accessibility relation and one that\n\u201clooks backwards\u201d. In tense logic the elements of the set\n\\(W\\) are called moments or instants and the\nrelation \\(R\\) is called the earlier-later relation.\n\nOf course, it is straightforward to modify the translations\n\\(\\mathrm{ST}_a\\) and \\(\\mathrm{HT}\\) above such that translations are\nobtained between hybrid tense logic (including the\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder) and first-order logic with equality. The\nfirst-order logic under consideration is what Prior called\nfirst-order earlier-later logic. Given the translations, it\nfollows that Prior\u2019s first-order earlier-later logic has the\nsame expressive power as hybrid tense logic.\n\nNow, Prior introduced hybrid tense logic in connection with what he\ncalled four grades of tense-logical involvement. The motivation for\nhis four grades of tense-logical involvement was philosophical. The\nfour grades were presented in the book Prior (1968), Chapter XI (also\nChapter XI in the new edition Prior (2003)). Moreover, see Prior\n(1967), Chapter V.6 and Appendix B.3-4. For a more general discussion,\nsee the posthumously published book Prior and Fine (1977). The stages\nprogress from what can be regarded as pure first-order earlier-later\nlogic to what can be regarded as pure tense logic; the goal being to\nbe able to consider the tense logic of the fourth stage as\nencompassing the earlier-later logic of the first stage. In other\nwords, the goal was to be able to translate the first-order logic of\nthe earlier-later relation into tense logic. It was with this goal in\nmind Prior introduced so-called instant-propositions:\n\nWhat I shall call the third grade of tense-logical involvement\nconsists in treating the instant-variables \\(a, b, c\\), etc. as also\nrepresenting propositions. (Prior 2003, p. 124)\n\n\nIn the context of modal logic, Prior called such propositions\npossible-world-propositions. Of course, this is what we here call\nnominals. Prior also introduced the binder \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) and\nwhat we here call satisfaction operators (he used the notation\n\\(\\mathtt{T(a, \\phi)}\\) instead of \\(\\mathtt{@_a \\phi}\\) for\nsatisfaction operators). In fact, Prior\u2019s third grade tense\nlogic is identical to the hybrid tense logic as defined above. The\n\\(\\mathtt{\\downarrow}\\) binder was introduced much later. Thus, Prior\nobtained the expressive power of his first-order earlier-later logic\nby adding to ordinary tense logic further expressive power in the form\nof nominals, satisfaction operators, and the binder\n\\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\). So from a technical point of view he clearly\nreached his goal.\n\nHowever, from a philosophical point of view it has been debated\nwhether or not the ontological import of his third grade tense logic\nis the same as the ontological import of the first-order earlier-later\nlogic. For example, the \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\) binder is by some authors\nconsidered a direct analogy to the first-order \\(\\mathtt{\\forall}\\)\nquantifier, and therefore suspect; see for example the paper Sylvan\n(1996) in the collection Copeland (1996). See Bra\u00fcner (2002) for\na discussion of Prior\u2019s fourth grade tense logic. See also\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (1993), \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and\nHasle (2006), M\u00fcller (2007), and Blackburn (2006). Finally, see\nthe discussion of Prior\u2019s four grades in Chapter 1 of\nBra\u00fcner (2011a).\n\nThe paper Hasle (2020) points out traces of hybrid-logical ideas in\nPrior\u2019s works before the publication of Prior (1967) and Prior\n(1968) (new edition Prior (2003)). The above mentioned paper\n\u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and Hasle (2006) gives a detailed account of\nPrior\u2019s logical work. For a comprehensive account of\nPrior\u2019s life and work, see the book \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m and\nHasle (1995). The paper Hasle and \u00d8hrstr\u00f8m (2016)\ndescribes Prior\u2019s methodological approach, in particular, his\nview on formalisation and the role of symbolic logic in conceptual\nstudies.\n",
