    "main_text": "Epistemology || The Doxastic Practice Approach\n9.1 The Doxastic Practice Approach\n\nWilliam Alston has defended the beliefs that\npeople form from their mystical and numinous experiences,\nspecifically of a theistic kind, based on their \u201cdoxastic\npractice.\u201d He defines a \u201cdoxastic practice\u201d as consisting of\nsocially established ways of forming and epistemically evaluating\nbeliefs (the \u201coutput\u201d) from a certain kind of content from various\ninputs, such as cognitive and perceptual ones (Alston 1991, 100;\nalso see Alston 2005, chap. 9\u201311). The practice is beholden to\nan \u201cover-rider system\u201d which is a background system of beliefs\nagainst which beliefs supported by the practice are checked for\npossible over-riders. The practice of forming physical-object beliefs\nbased on sense-perception is an example of a doxastic practice;\ndrawing deductive conclusions from premises is another. Alston (1993)\nargues that the justification of every doxastic practice is\n\u201cepistemically circular\u201d \u2014 i.e., its reliability cannot be\nestablished in any way independent of the practice itself. This\nincludes sense-perception practice. However, we cannot avoid\nengaging in doxastic practices. Therefore, Alston contends, it is\na matter of practical rationality to engage in the doxastic\npractices we do engage in providing there is no good reason to think\nthey are unreliable.\n\nThere are also doxastic practices consisting of forming beliefs about\nGod, God\u2019s purposes for us, and the like, grounded on religious\nand mystical experiences such as \u201cGod is now appearing to\nme.\u201d The Christian doxastic practice has an over-rider\nsystem consisting of scriptures, Christian dogma, and guidelines\nresulting from the past history of the mystical Christian doxastic\npractice. It follows from Alston\u2019s argument that it is rational\nfor a person engaged in such a practice to take its belief\noutputs as true unless the practice is shown to be unreliable. Thus we\nhave an affirmative answer to question Q1.\n\nMost objections to Alston are equally objections to the Argument from\nExperience or come from general epistemological complaints.\nObjections that apply specifically to Alston include Jonathan\nKvanvig\u2019s (1994) faulting of Alston for a loose employment of\n\u201crationality.\u201d He argues that no one meaning of that term can do\nthe work Alston does with it. Another objection is that Alston moves\nfrom \u201cIt is practically rational to engage in a Christian doxastic\npractice\u201d to \u201cIt is rational for me to believe the Christian\ndoxastic practice is reliable.\u201d Others argue that there is a\nproblem with the construction of the over-rider system of the\nChristian mystical practice since the guidelines gleaned from the\nhistory of the practice, so it is argued, were compromised by\nandrocentric bias and outdated scientific beliefs. (See Section 10.)\nThese detract from the practice\u2019s epistemic legitimacy\n(Gellman 2011).\n\nIt is also a question whether the Christian doxastic practice approach\nis able to justify conversion experiences since in such experiences\nthe subject is not yet Christian and cannot employ the Christian\nover-rider system when becoming convinced to accept the Christian\npractice and its over-rider system.\n",
