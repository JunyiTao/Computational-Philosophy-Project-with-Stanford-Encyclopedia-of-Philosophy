    "main_text": "The geometry of physical space and topology\n3. The geometry of physical space and topology\n\nEven when he was writing about physiology, Helmholtz\u2019s vocation\nas a mathematical physicist was apparent. Helmholtz used mathematical\nreasoning to support his arguments for the sign theory, rather than\nexclusively philosophical or empirical evidence. Throughout his\ncareer, Helmholtz\u2019s work is marked by two preoccupations:\nconcrete examples and mathematical reasoning. Helmholtz\u2019s early\nwork in physiology of perception gave him concrete examples of how\nhumans perceive spatial relations between objects. These examples\nwould prove useful to illustrate the relationship between metric\ngeometry and the spatial relations between objects of perception.\nLater, Helmholtz used his experience with the concrete science of\nhuman perception to pose a problem for the Riemannian approach to\ngeometry.\n\nHelmholtz\u2019s work on geometry was made public from 1868, the year\nhe gave a lecture, \u201cOn the Actual Foundations of\nGeometry,\u201d in Heidelberg, and published his \u201cOn the Facts\nUnderlying Geometry.\u201d The latter \u201castonished\u201d the\nacademic public, who had considered Helmholtz primarily an\nexperimental scientist and physiologist (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 254).\nHowever, Helmholtz had initially wanted to be a physicist, and had\nalways been alive to the mathematical consequences of his work in\nphysiology. Riemann\u2019s work revolutionized mathematics and\nphysics, and philosophy by extension, and Helmholtz was perhaps the\nfirst to recognize the extent of the revolution. Indeed, Helmholtz\nclaimed that he had come to results similar to Riemann\u2019s, though\nperhaps slightly later. Although the publication of Riemann\u2019s\nHabilitationsrede, \u201cOn the Hypotheses Underlying\nGeometry,\u201d meant that Helmholtz\u2019s own results would not be\nseen as original, Helmholtz says in his own essay that he is content\nthat \u201cso distinguished a mathematician [as Riemann] should have\nconsidered these questions as worthy of his attention\u201d\n(Helmholtz 1883 [1868], cited in K\u00f6nigsberger 261). With his 1868\nessay, Helmholtz saw himself as contributing to the Riemannian\napproach to the foundations of geometry (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 254).\nHelmholtz\u2019s title, \u201cOn the Facts Underlying\nGeometry,\u201d is a deliberate echo of Riemann\u2019s \u201cOn the\nHypotheses Underlying Geometry.\u201d The difference in the titles,\nfacts versus hypotheses, underscores the fact that while\nHelmholtz\u2019s approach is very similar to Riemann\u2019s, there\nis at least one significant difference.\n\nIn \u201cOn the Hypotheses Underlying Geometry,\u201d Riemann\nfocuses on how to determine the overall topological properties of\nspace. Topological properties are those spatial properties of figures\nthat are invariant under transformation, that is, that stay the same\nwhen the figures move. Riemann proves that a space of n dimensions,\nthat is, a space determined by n continuously and independently\nvarying magnitudes, has constant curvature, but only under the\nhypothesis that all spatial figures can be moved or rotated anywhere\nin space without changing their form, the so-called \u201cAxiom of\nFree Mobility\u201d (cf. K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 260\u2013261). For\nthe case of astronomy, Riemann observes:\n\nIf one assumes that bodies exist independently of place, then the\nmeasure of curvature is constant overall, and then it follows from\nastronomical measurements that the measure of curvature cannot be\ndistinguished from null\u2026 However, if bodies are not independent\nof place, then one cannot deduce infinitely small mass relationships\nfrom the relationships between large masses. In that case, between any\ngiven points in three dimensions the measure of curvature can have any\nrandom value, provided that the entire curvature of any measurable\npart of space is not distinguishable from null (Riemann 1892 [1854],\n285, my translation).\n\n\nThe assumption \u201cthat bodies exist independently of place\u201d\nis valid if and only if the properties of bodies remain invariant when\nmoved. That is, if a body changes place, that is a movement, and if\nthe body continues to have the same properties in any different place,\nthen its properties are invariant under transformation. Riemann goes\non to say that, without this assumption, the units of comparison that\nare the basis for astronomical and other measurements \u2014 rays of\nlight as the shortest path between two points, rigid bodies like meter\nsticks as the basis of distance measurement \u2014 no longer have the\ninvariant properties on which one can base valid measurements.\n\nIn \u201cOn the Facts Underlying Geometry,\u201d Helmholtz\ninvestigates a related, but distinct question. He agrees with Riemann\nthat geometry is not possible unless we can compare figures to each\nother and measure them, and that measurement is not possible unless at\nleast some properties of the figures we are measuring do not change\nwhen the figures move. Helmholtz asks, what are the most general\naxioms of geometry that must hold for such motions, motions preserving\nthe spatial properties of figures, to be possible?\n\nHelmholtz presents the idea of \u201crigid motions\u201d to account\nfor these invariant properties. \u201cRigid motions\u201d are those\nmotions that preserve a set of properties of the objects. For\ninstance, when a sphere rotates around its central vertical axis, that\nmotion preserves the sphere\u2019s symmetries about the x and y axes,\nand thus these symmetries are invariant under that particular\ntransformation (rotation). A given object may have a group of\nproperties that remain invariant under transformation and a group that\nchange, that is, when objects move in a certain way they may stretch\nor lose symmetry about an axis. After the publication of\nHelmholtz\u2019s work, Sophus Lie argued that rigid motions form\ngroups, and described the set of rigid motions in the mathematical\nterms of group theory.\n\nWhile Riemann tries to describe the general properties of space,\nHelmholtz asks what the most general geometrical axioms are that can\naccount for our empirical measurement of objects. These will be the\naxioms that preserve observed rigid motions, given an underlying\nsystem of geometry. Helmholtz investigates the question of which\nsystems of geometry (Euclidean, Lobachevskian, and Riemannian) are\npossible under which assumptions. Here Helmholtz makes an initial\nmistake, and argues that only Euclidean geometry can account for our\nactual physical measurements. In April 1869, Eugenio Beltrami pointed\nout in a letter to Helmholtz that Lobachevskian geometry could be\nadequate to the task under the assumption that we live in a\n\u201cpseudosphere\u201d (see Other Internet Resources). Helmholtz\nconcedes the point immediately (K\u00f6nigsberger 1906, 263). In 1870,\nin \u201cOn the Origin and Significance of the Axioms of\nGeometry,\u201d Helmholtz investigates in much closer detail the\nquestion of whether non-Euclidean geometries can be visualized. This\nessay, perhaps even more than \u201cOn the Facts Underlying\nGeometry,\u201d was widely influential. Moritz Schlick and Hans\nReichenbach engaged with Helmholtz\u2019s views in the 1870 essay\n(see, e.g., Reichenbach 1920, Schlick\u2019s notes to Helmholtz\n1921). A related article, \u201cThe Origin and Meaning of Geometrical\nAxioms,\u201d was published in Mind in 1878, and Russell\nresponds to it in his doctoral dissertation.\n\nIn Space, Number, and Geometry from Helmholtz to Cassirer,\nFrancesca Biagioli (2016) analyzes Helmholtz\u2019s theories of\ngeometry and of measurement, including their origins in the work of\nKant, Riemann, and Gauss, and the reception, development, and\nextension of Helmholtz\u2019s work through engagement with Felix\nKlein\u2019s Erlanger Programm, Sophus Lie\u2019s theory of groups,\nthe conventionalism of Henri Poincar\u00e9, and neo-Kantian\nreception in Alois Riehl, Hermann Cohen, Ernst Cassirer, and Bruno\nBauch. Biagioli (2016), Biagioli (2014), and Biagioli (2018) deal with\nthe question of how Helmholtz and neo-Kantians, especially Ernst\nCassirer, could claim that space is transcendental without also\narguing for the universality of Euclidean geometry. Matthias Neuber\n(2012, 163) argues that, while \u201cHelmholtz\u2019s theory of\nspace had significant impact on Schlick\u2019s early \u2018critical\nrealist\u2019 point of view\u201d, Schlick ends up radically\ntransforming Helmholtz\u2019s account.\n\nMarco Giovanelli (2017) argues that the mathematical core of the\ndevelopment of special relativity is found in the Riemannian tradition\nand especially in the work of Christoffel, Lipschitz, Ricci, and,\nlater, Levi-Civit\u00e1 (Giovanelli 2017, 328). Giovanelli argues\nthat the claims for the Helmholtzian tradition as the sole progenitor\nof special relativity are exaggerated, and that the real development\nwas a \u2018collision\u2019 of traditions, in the sense well known\nfrom John Norton\u2019s paper on the Kleinian and Riemannian\ntraditions in general relativity.\n\nBiagioli (2023 and 2016), Darrigol (2003), Paula Cant\u00f9 (2018),\nand Matthias Neuber (Neuber 2018a, Neuber 2018b) delve into\nHelmholtz\u2019s work on the theory of measurement, including his\nessay \u201c\u00dcber Z\u00e4hlen und Messen,\u201d as a precursor\nof more recent treatments of the topic. Cant\u00f9 focuses on the\nquestion of the applicability of mathematics in general, a question\nalso found in Frege, Hale, Wright, and Batitsky, while Neuber and\nBiagioli (2016) focus on Helmholtz\u2019s account of the a priori and\nempirical conditions for measurement in physics and mathematics.\nBiagioli (2023) focuses on Helmholtz\u2019s contributions to the\npsychophysical problem of the measurement of sensation.\n\nFor more detailed explanations of the notions in this section, see the\nentry on\n 19th century geometry.\n\nSee Section 7 of this entry for references to work on the\nphilosophical implications of Helmholtz\u2019s theory of\ngeometry.\n",
