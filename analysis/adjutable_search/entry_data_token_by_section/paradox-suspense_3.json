    "main_text": "Moment By Moment Forgetting\n4. Moment By Moment Forgetting\n\n\nRichard Gerrig argues for what we can call the moment-by-moment \nforgetting theory. Unlike the previous two explanations, Gerrig \nthinks that suspense requires uncertainty. His solution to the \nparadox is to deny the second premise\u2014that knowing the outcome \nof a narrative precludes uncertainty. Despite appearances, Gerrig \nclaims that one can both know how a story turns out and be uncertain \nabout the result while the story unfolds. \n\n\nBy appealing to some putative features of our cognitive architecture, \nGerrig claims that people are unable to effectively make use of their\nknowledge of the outcome of a story in such a way that would preclude\nsuspense. Gerrig offers an evolutionary psychological explanation of \nhow this could be possible. He argues that evolution has not equipped\nhumans with the ability to look up known outcomes to repeated events.\nSince there are no exactly repeated events in nature, there was \nsimply no selective pressure to develop such an ability. As such, \nrepeaters can feel suspense, because while they are caught in the \ngrips of a story they are unaware of the outcome. In this way, Gerrig\nargues, fictional scenarios can be effectively uncertain for viewers \neven if they know the outcome. \n\n\nThis may seem plausible in relation to cases in which suspenseful \nsituations occur rapidly, but take a movie such as Speed (Jan \nde Bont, 1994) where a series of dangerous situations put the \ncharacters in jeopardy, and each situation unfolds over the course of\nseveral minutes. It\u2019s hard to imagine that recall could take \nso long. The ability to make decisions rapidly in stressful \nsituations, such as how to escape a coming attacker or how to avoid \nbeing hit by a car, involves knowing how pursuers and drivers behave \nby recalling similar scenarios. This mechanism seems close to what is\ninvolved into forecasting the outcome of a fictional event. If we can\nforecast, then surely we can remember in the span of several minutes \nwhether or not our forecast is correct based on our knowledge of the \nstory. Given the prevalence of similar cognitive capacities and the \ngradual unfolding of suspense scenarios, Gerrig\u2019s portrait of the \nlazy mind of repeaters is prima facie unconvincing. \n\n\nA related problem with Gerrig\u2019s account is that if viewers really do \nsuffer from such mental handicaps as a matter of our evolutionary \nmakeup, then he lacks an explanation of why suspense diminishes for \nmany viewers. It would be strange to say that some of us have evolved\na special cognitive ability to recall the outcomes of identically \nrepeating events when there are no evolutionary pressures for such a \ntrait. What seems to be the problem is that Gerrig has miscast the \nkind of skill that is involved. As stated previously, our ability to \nforecast the outcomes of familiar types of events can plausibly \naccount for our ability to remember the outcomes of familiar \nfictional scenarios. \n\n\nA further problem with Gerrig\u2019s theory is that it cannot account for \na common phenomenon of repeated viewing, namely that with knowledge \nof the outcome of a story we are able to notice things that we might \notherwise find unexceptional. Take Hitchcock\u2019s Shadow of a \nDoubt (1943) as an example. Early in the film, aspects of Uncle \nCharlie\u2019s behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed seem like \nobvious evidence of his murderous past on repeated viewings. This \ncommon experience requires the same kind of recall abilities that \nGerrig thinks are necessarily retarded. If there were, as Gerrig \nsuggests, \u201ca systematic failure of memory processes to produce \nrelevant knowledge as the narrative unfolds\u201d then our ability when \ninformed by knowledge of the narrative outcome to notice new clues \nupon a reviewing is utterly mysterious (Gerrig 1997, 172). Since the \nmoment-by-moment forgetting theory implies that one cannot both feel \nsuspense on a reviewing of Shadow of a Doubt and notice new \nclues during the same scenes, it appears to conflict with the \nevidence. \n",
