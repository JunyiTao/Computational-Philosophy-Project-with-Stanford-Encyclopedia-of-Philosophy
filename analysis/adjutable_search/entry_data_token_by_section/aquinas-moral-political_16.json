But practical reasons (i.e. reasons for action) are\npropositional: they can be stated as principles and other standards,\nmore or less specific. So principles, ultimately the first principles\nof practical reason (that is, of natural law), are more fundamental to\nethics than virtues are. Aquinas accepts Aristotle\u2019s notion that\nevery virtue is a mean between too much and too little, and he\nconstantly stresses that it is reason \u2013 with the principles and\nrules (regulae) it understands \u2013 that settles the mean\nand thus determines what is too much or too little. Indeed, the\nprinciples of practical reason (natural law) establish the ends of the\nvirtues: ST II-II q. 47 a. 6. And the master virtue of\nbringing practical reasonableness into all one\u2019s deliberations,\nchoices, and carrying out of choices \u2013 the virtue of\nprudentia, a virtue both intellectual (of one\u2019s\nintelligence) and moral (of one\u2019s whole will and character)\n\u2013 is part of the definition, content, and influence of every\nother moral virtue: ST I-II q. 65 a. 1, q. 66 a. 3 ad 3,\netc.\n\nAquinas arranged the Summa Theologiae\u2019s exposition of\nmorality within a classification, not of the goods to which rational\nacts are directed, nor of types of act, nor of practical\nreason\u2019s standards, but of the virtues. Explicable as a\nreflective theological project of depicting the flourishing or\ndeviations of human beings in an account of the whole movement of\ncreature from their origin to their fulfillment, his decision to adopt\nthis superstructure has tended to obscure the real foundations of his\nethics. As one would expect from the considerations sketched in the\npreceding paragraph, his actual arguments about what is right and\nwrong, virtuous or vicious, get their premises not from analysis of\nthe virtues at stake but rather from the principles and more specific\nstandards, norms, precepts or rules of practical reason(ableness). It\nis the conclusions of these arguments that are then re-expressed in\nterms of what is contrary to or in line with one or more of the\nvirtues.\n",
