Towards a \u201cCivil\u201d Philosophy: Life of Pico, Epigrams, Richard III\n\nIn 1510, More found an occasion to publish a work he had begun years\nearlier, having undoubtedly been introduced to Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola by his friends and teachers who had studied in Italy, where\nthe \u201cPrince of Concord\u201d was well known (Sylvester 1967:\n35). Pico\u2019s nephew and heir, Gianfrancesco Pico della Mirandola,\npublished in 1496 a 496\u2013page biography of his uncle and\nanthology of his works. More\u2019s highly edited 34\u2013page\nbiography and anthology radically re-envisioned Pico\u2019s life and\nphilosophic project. As the historian James McConica has pointed out,\neverything\n\n\nforeign to More\u2019s thoroughly orthodox outlook is eliminated; of\nall the sources for Pico\u2019s thought in the original version, only\nThomas Aquinas is singled out for mention. (1981: 65; see also\nKoterski 2010: 61).\n\n\nIn his version of The Life of John Pico, More modified the\ntexts he translated to register his disagreement with Pico\u2019s\nunderstanding of philosophy. Contrary to Pico\u2019s own aristocratic\nview that the \u201cprincely practice\u201d of philosophy should\nnever be \u201cmercenary\u201d or \u201cservile\u201d (EW\n77.79\u201382, 78.45, 86.33), More adds repeatedly, with comic irony,\nthat philosophy brings \u201cprofit\u201d (EW 63.37, 46;\n68.27; 78.14), especially by providing \u201cinstruction \u2026 in\nmoral virtue\u201d (see More\u2019s addition at EW\n77.84\u201385). As the editor of the Yale edition of The Life of\nPico observes, More\u2019s many omissions, selections, and\nadditions are \u201cconcerned to emphasize the necessity of the\nactive life\u201d and to show the insufficiency of \u201cthe\nreclusive life of the solitary scholar\u201d (CW 1: xlviii).\nIn this way, More adds a Ciceronian and Senecan perspective, casting\nphilosophy as a most useful\n art[1]\n while deftly criticizing\n Pico[2]\n for not fulfilling important duties of the \u201ccivil and active\nlife\u201d (EW 77.89\u201390), and for insisting that\n\u201cphilosophers love liberty; \u2026 they cannot serve\u201d\n(EW 78.56, 58)\u2014thus neglecting the ordinary duties of\neveryday life, as will Raphael Hythloday in Utopia.\n\nThe dangers of an active civic life as well as the consequences of\nneglect by civic leaders are seen in More\u2019s History of King\nRichard III (ca. 1513), a work never published during\nhis own lifetime despite the much revised and differing versions he\ndrafted in Latin and English. In both versions More dramatized how\nhuman beings use their reason to decide not to follow reason. King\nEdward IV, for example, ends up tragically \u201ctaking counsel of\n\u2026 desire\u201d rather than of reason (EW 124.51).\nQueen Elizabeth Woodville (Edward\u2019s wife), despite the powerful\nreasons she gave for not abandoning her young and sick son to the\n\u201cwolf\u201d Richard, goes against those reasons and freely\nhands him over. This same foolish propensity to follow passion rather\nthan reason is a major topic of More\u2019s many satirical epigrams\n(e.g., Epigrams 199, 210, and 214). His satires point to the\nimportance of self-knowledge and of a well-ordered and peaceful state\nof soul so that reason is unhindered from making a \u201cgood\njudgment\u201d (<1521> letter to Margaret Roper [EW\n314.79\u201380]); these are the educational goals More set for his\nchildren and for himself (<1518> letter to Gonell [EW\n288\u201390]).\n\nThe 102 of More\u2019s Latin poems that are translations from the\nGreek, combined with his own 179 original epigrams, show his interest\nin the full scope of human life. As the editors of the Yale edition\nput it, More\u2019s \u201crefreshing new range of subjects\u201d\nmakes us\n\n\nfeel we are leaving the study of a scholar or a cleric and entering\nthe world of merchants, lawyers, and courtiers\u2026. It is this\nvivid interest in life in all its aspects that makes More\u2019s\nEpigrammata incomparably the best book of Latin epigrams in\nthe sixteenth century. (CW 3.2: 62, 63)\n\n\nA large number of these witty poems highlight the ridiculous, but many\nof the most distinctive ones are political and address the question of\ntyranny versus good rule. To quote the Yale editors again:\nMore\u2019s\n\n\nfavorite concern is for the difference between a good king and a\ntyrant, but it is evident from a reading of this group of epigrams\nthat, whereas the existence of good kings is a theoretical\npossibility, the existence of tyrants is a present danger.\n(CW 3.2: 62)\n\n\nIn fact, his criticisms of King Henry VII in Epigram 19 were so severe\nthat soon after More published these poems the French humanist\nGermanus Brixius (Germain de Brie) accused him of defaming the monarch\n(c. 1519 Antimorus [CW 3.2: 493, 495])\u2014an\naccusation so serious that More was advised to fight to protect\nhimself (<March\u2013 April 1520> letter to Erasmus\n[EW 302.14\u201318]).\n\nIn 1516, More\u2019s collection of epigrams was to be published with\nUtopia (CW 3.1: lxi\u2013lxii; CWE 3:\n316.89\u201390; CWE 4: 67.22\u201324; CWE 4: 281),\nbut because of printing difficulties it was instead first published\nwith the 1518 edition of Utopia; this added yet another\nelement of dialectical engagement since the epigrams contain terms and\nthemes present in the already provocative Utopia. As David\nBaker points out, for example, several of the epigrams portray the\ncharacter of the true princeps, a term used throughout\nUtopia and one which was fraught with historical and cultural\ncontroversy (33\u201345). Significantly, More uses\n\u201ccitizens\u201d and \u201cpeople\u201d rather than\n\u201csubjects\u201d in his literary works and explicitly criticizes\nkings who treat \u201csubjects\u201d as \u201cslaves\u201d (31\nOctober <1516> letter to Erasmus [EW\n278.63\u201365]).\n",
