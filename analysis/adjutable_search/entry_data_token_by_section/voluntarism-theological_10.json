    "main_text": "Perennial difficulties for metaethical theological voluntarism || Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness\n3.2 Theological voluntarism and arbitrariness\n\nIt is also an extraordinarily popular charge against theological\nvoluntarism that it entails, objectionably, that morality is\narbitrary. There is, however, more than one objection here, and the\ndifferent objections need to be distinguished and answered\nindividually. One claim is that theological voluntarism implies that\nGod\u2019s commands/intentions, on which moral statuses depend, must\nbe arbitrary. A distinct claim is that theological voluntarism implies\nthat the content of morality is itself arbitrary, that it is of the\nessence of morality to exhibit a certain rational structure, and that\ntheological voluntarism precludes its having that structure. I will\nconsider each of these objections in turn.\n\nOne arbitrariness objection against theological voluntarism is that if\ntheological voluntarism is true, then God\u2019s commands/intentions\nmust be arbitrary; and it cannot be that morality could wholly depend\non something arbitrary; and so theological voluntarism must be false.\nIn favor of the claim that if theological voluntarism were true, then\nmorality would be arbitrary: morality would be arbitrary, on\ntheological voluntarism, if God lacks reasons for the\ncommands/intentions that God gives/has; but because theological\nvoluntarism holds that reasons depend on God\u2019s\ncommands/intentions, it is clear that there could ultimately be no\nreason for God\u2019s commanding/intending one thing rather than\nanother. In favor of the claim that morality could not wholly depend\non something arbitrary: when we say that some moral state of affairs\nobtains, we take it that there is a reason for that moral state of\naffairs obtaining rather than another. Moral states of affairs do not\njust happen to obtain.\n\nJust as in the case of the objection from God\u2019s goodness, the\nstrength of this version of the objection from arbitrariness depends\non the formulation of theological voluntarism that is being attacked.\nThe arbitrariness objection becomes more difficult to answer the\nstronger the relationship between God\u2019s intentions/commands and\nmoral properties is held to be; and it becomes more difficult to\nanswer the more normative properties one attempts to account for by\nappeal to God\u2019s intentions/commands.\n\nThe arbitrariness objection has less force if one holds that, say,\nonly moral obligations are to be accounted for by theological\nvoluntarism. The claim made by the objector is that morality is\narbitrary on theological voluntarism, because God has no reason for\nhaving one set of commands/intentions rather than another. But this is\nso only if one appeals to the very strong form of theological\nvoluntarism on which all normative states of affairs depend on\nGod\u2019s will. If one holds that only moral obligations are\ndetermined by God\u2019s will, then God might have moral reasons for\nselecting one set of commands/intentions rather than another: that,\nfor example, one set of commands/intentions is more benevolent, or\njust, or loyal, than another. If one holds that all moral properties\nare determined by God\u2019s will, then God might have nonmoral\nreasons for selecting one set of commands/intentions rather than\nanother: that one set of commands/intentions is more loving than\nanother. The fewer normative properties that a version of theological\nvoluntarism attempts to account for, the less susceptible it is to the\nclaim that theological voluntarism implies the arbitrariness of\nGod\u2019s commands/intentions. (For further discussion of the role\nthat restriction of theological voluntarism to a proper subset of\nnormative statuses has had in answering these perennial objections,\nsee Murphy 2012.)\n\nNow, one might respond on behalf of this version of the arbitrariness\nobjection that even if it is true that there can be reasons for God to\nchoose the commands/intentions that God chooses, it is unlikely that\nthese reasons would wholly determine God\u2019s choice of\ncommands/intentions, and so there would be some latitude for\narbitrariness in God\u2019s choices/intentions. But of itself this is\nnot much of a worry. The initial claim pressed against theological\nvoluntarism was that it made all of God\u2019s commands/intentions\nultimately arbitrary, and morality could not depend on something so\nthoroughly arbitrary. But the chastened claim\u2014that there is some\narbitrariness in God\u2019s commands\u2014is far less troubling on\nits own. We are already familiar with morality depending to some\nextent on arbitrary facts about the world: if one thinks about the\nparticular requirements that he or she is under, one will note\nstraightaway the extent to which these requirements have resulted from\ncontingent and indeed fluky facts about oneself, one\u2019s\nrelationships, and one\u2019s circumstances. It does not seem that\nallowing that God has some choices to make concerning what to\ncommand/intend with respect to the conduct of created rational beings\nthat are undetermined by reasons must introduce an intolerable\narbitrariness into the total set of divine commands/intentions. (See\nalso Carson 2012.)\n\nAllowing for such pockets of divine discretion does not provide\nbacking for this version of the objection from arbitrariness, but\nrather offers a premise for the other version of the objection from\narbitrariness. This other version of the objection from arbitrariness\nholds that moral states of affairs exhibit a certain rational\nstructure that they would not have if theological voluntarism were\ntrue. Here is the idea, roughly formulated. Suppose that some moral\nstate of affairs obtains\u2014that it is the case that murder is\nwrong, or that lying is objectionable, or that courage is a virtue, or\nthat Sharon\u2019s snubbing me in that way was unforgivable. The idea\nis that for any such moral state of affairs, the following is true:\neither we can provide a justification for the obtaining of\nthat moral state of affairs, or that moral state of affairs is\nnecessary. A justification of an obtaining moral state of\naffairs A is some obtaining moral state of affairs B\n(where A is not identical with B), which in\nconjunction with the other non-moral facts entails that A\nobtains. So, for example: it may be the justification for\nmurder\u2019s being prima facie wrong that murder is an\nintentional harm (non-moral fact) and intentionally harming is prima\nfacie wrong (obtaining moral state of affairs). Now, presumably not\nall moral states of affairs can be justified: eventually there will be\nbasic moral states of affairs, for which no justification can be\ngiven. But it would be very unsatisfactory to say that these basic\nmoral states of affairs just happen to obtain. So any basic moral\nstates of affairs must obtain necessarily. Perhaps unrelieved\nsuffering\u2019s being bad is a state of affairs of this sort,\nor perhaps rational beings\u2019 being worthy of\nrespect.\n\nThe claim that the structure of morality is not arbitrary is, put\npositively, the claim that every obtaining moral state of affairs\neither has a justification or is necessary. And, thus, what those who\nclaim that theological voluntarism entails that morality is\nobjectionably arbitrary mean is that if theological voluntarism is\ntrue, then there are some moral states of affairs that both lack a\njustification and are not necessary. The view that God\u2019s\ncommands/intentions are not wholly determined by reasons offer our\nbasis for holding that there are some moral states of affairs that\nboth lack a justification and are not necessary. For consider some act\nof \u03c6-ing that is not subsumed under any other issued divine\ncommand and which is such that God lacks decisive reasons to command\nor not to command its performance. In the possible world in which God\nissues a command to \u03c6, there is a moral state of\naffairs\u2014its being obligatory to \u03c6\u2014which lacks\na justification (for the action is subsumed under no other divine\ncommand) and is not necessary (for God might have failed to command\nthe action).\n\nOne might respond to this sort of worry by proposing that what God\ncommands/intends with respect to human action, God commands/intends\nnecessarily. But this seems either to understate the divine freedom or\nto overstate the determination of God\u2019s commands by reasons\n(Murphy 2002, pp. 83\u201385). More plausible is the denial of the\nclaim that morality must exhibit the particular structure presupposed\nin the objection. While I think that in general the subsumption model\nof justification is innocuous enough\u2014even particularists can\naffirm it, if they affirm even the most minimal doctrine of moral\nsupervenience\u2014its appeal to necessary moral states of affairs as\nthe only proper starting point is dubious. It is not clear why the\nstarting points for justification have to be necessary moral states of\naffairs, for two reasons.\n\nFirst, if these moral states of affairs are basic, then of course\ntheir moral status must not be explained by appeal to other moral\nstates of affairs, but that does not mean they must be necessary; they\nmight be contingent, and have their moral status explained in some way\nother than an appeal to another moral state of affairs. It could be,\nfor example, that the explanation of them appeals to a contingent\nnonmoral state of affairs plus some necessary state of affairs\nconcerning a connection between that contingent nonmoral state of\naffairs and the moral state of affairs. Theological voluntarism would\nbe an instance of this latter model. (For a discussion of a similar\nobjection raised against theological voluntarism by Ralph Cudworth\n(1731), and a similar response on behalf of theological voluntarism,\nsee Schroeder 2005.) \n\nSecond, the appeal to necessary moral states of affairs as the\nstopping point for explanation seems to assume that necessary moral\nstates of affairs somehow are not in need of explanation. But the very\nfact that some state of affairs obtains necessarily does not entail\nthat its obtaining does not require explanation, and there is no\nreason why moral states of affairs would be special on this score. So\none might think that not only is it possible for justifications to\nbottom out in contingent moral states of affairs, there is no reason\nto think that such justifications are as such any less adequate than\njustifications that bottom out in necessary moral states of affairs.\n(See Murphy 2011, pp. 47\u201349.)\n",
