    "main_text": "Democracy and the Global System || Why Global Democracy?\n1.3 Why Global Democracy?\n\n\nGlobal democrats thus share the view that individuals should\ncollectively rule themselves. To the extent that decision-making power\nmigrates beyond the state, democracy should follow. There is, of\ncourse, a prior question about why individuals should have roughly\nequal say in decision-making in the first place. On one level, it is a\nsimple definitional requirement of democracy. But this point simply\nbegs the question: why should we pursue democracy at all? As with\ntheoretical discussions of democracy, a variety of intrinsic and\ninstrumental reasons for global democracy can be discerned in the\nliterature. Intrinsic justifications point to democracy as a valuable\nmethod of decision-making in-and-of-itself. Instrumental claims hinge\nupon the outcome of democracy being beneficial, especially compared to\nalternatives.\n\n\nThe most common intrinsic claim relates to cosmopolitanism, which\nmany proponents of global democracy have drawn upon as a moral\nfoundation motivating the project (Kant 1991[1795]). Thomas Pogge\n(1992: 48\u20139) has argued that cosmopolitans share at least this set of\nbeliefs: 1) that human beings are the ultimate units of moral concern;\n2) this status applies to all humans equally; 3) everyone should be\ntreated as ultimate units of concern by all others. Global democracy\nhelps realize this cosmopolitan ideal by treating all individuals as\nmoral beings capable of exercising equal control over shared destinies.\nIt is important to note, however, that differences between global\ndemocrats exist in terms of the scope of their cosmopolitan commitment.\nWhile almost all global democrats see individuals as the fundamental\nobject of concern, many proponents argue that relational qualities\nstill matter in generating normative prescriptions (Miller 1995). As\nsuch, \u2018national communities\u2019 or \u2018humanity\u2019 may\nwell be important groups that deserve standing in global democratic\npolitics for moral or pragmatic\nreasons.\n\n\nSeveral other intrinsic arguments, though, have been made in\nliterature. These claims all suggest that global democracy is morally\ndesirable irrespective of the benefits generated. For instance, many\nscholars have suggested that global democracy embodies equality,\nautonomy, non-domination, and human rights (see respectively: Erman\n2012; Held 1995; Bohman 2007; Goodhart 2008). These fundamental rights\nshould be valued for their own sake and therefore provide an additional\nmoral foundation\u2014related to, but sometimes distinct from,\ncosmopolitanism\u2014for pursuing democracy beyond borders. These\narguments are most common amongst liberal democrats and neo-Roman\nrepublicans (Pettit 1997).\n\n\nOther scholars put instrumental considerations at the fore. In this\nvein, proponents have maintained that global democracy is required for\nepistemic, problem-solving, justice, and legitimacy-based reasons. John\nDryzek (2000) has noted that democracy enables a wide-variety of\nperspectives to shape policy and thus increases the chances of making\nthe \u2018correct\u2019 decision (see also Landemore 2013).\nSimilarly, scholars in the pragmatist tradition of John Dewey have\nsuggested that global democracy is required to generate compliance with\ninternational rules and thus solve collective action problems such as\nclimate change (Bray 2013). By participating in the formation of\nlaw-making, individuals are more likely to comply with the agreement.\nLaura Valentini (2012) has claimed that global democracy is required\nfor global justice. Democratic mechanisms need to be in place to sort\nout reasonable disagreements as to how resources should be allocated.\nFinally, Michael Z\u00fcrn and his co-authors (2012) suggest that\nglobal democratic procedures can help provide IOs with important stocks\nof sociological legitimacy and hence avoid complications of\npoliticization (see also Buchanan and Keohane 2006).\n",
