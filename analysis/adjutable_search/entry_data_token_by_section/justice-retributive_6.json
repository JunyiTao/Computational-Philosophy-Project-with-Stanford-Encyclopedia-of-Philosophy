    "main_text": "Range of Meanings and Uses || Positive retributivism\n3.2 Positive retributivism\n\nPositive retributivism, or simply \u201cretributivism\u201d,\ninvolves both positive and negative desert claims. The positive desert\nclaim holds that wrongdoers morally deserve punishment for their\nwrongful acts (see\n section 4.6\n for a discussion of the deontic and consequentialist dimensions of\nthis). This claim comes in stronger and weaker versions. For example,\nMichael Moore (1997: 87) writes: \u201cRetributivism \u2026 is the\nview that punishment is justified by the desert of the\noffender\u201d. Jeffrie Murphy (2007: 11) is more pluralistic,\nwriting: \u201c[A] retributivist is a person who believes that the\nprimary justification for punishing a criminal is that the criminal\ndeserves it\u201d. A retributivist could take an even weaker view,\nthat there is some intrinsic positive value in punishing a\nwrongdoer for his wrongful acts, apart from any other consequences\nthat might arise from doing so. (For a discussion of three dimensions\nof strength or weakness for a retributive view, see Berman 2016).\n\nThis positive desert claim is complemented by a negative deontic\nclaim: Those who have done no wrong may not be punished. This\nprohibits both punishing those not guilty of wrongdoing (who deserve\nno punishment), and punishing the guilty more than they deserve (i.e.,\ninflicting disproportional punishment).\n\nOf course, the innocent will inevitably sometimes be punished; no\nhuman system can operate flawlessly. And retributivists should not\nduck what it means to commit such a mistake: it wrongs the innocent\nperson. But this is not a fatal problem for retributivists. It does\nnot imply that they risk acting impermissibly if they punish\npeople. Permissibility is best understood as an action-guiding notion,\nnot one tied directly to what is objectively justifiable (Scanlon\n2008: 47\u201352). As an action-guiding notion, it must make use of a\nrelevant standard of proof. If the right standard is met\u2014the\n\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard has recently been\ncalled into question (Laudan 2011, but see Walen 2015)\u2014then\npunishers act permissibly, even if they unwittingly punish the\ninnocent (see also Schedler 2011; Simons 2012: 67\u201369).\n\nMost contemporary retributivists accept both the positive and the\nnegative desert claims. Illustrating with the rapist case from\n section 1:\n he may not be punished more than he deserves for the rape he\ncommitted, but he deserves a reasonably harsh sentence for his rape\nand he ought to be given the sentence he deserves, even though he is\nalready incapacitated and he need not be punished in any serious way\nto contribute to general deterrence.\n",
