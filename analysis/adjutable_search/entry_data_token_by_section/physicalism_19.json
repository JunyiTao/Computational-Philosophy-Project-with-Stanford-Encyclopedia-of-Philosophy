    "main_text": "The Case Against Physicalism || Meaning and Intentionality\n5.2 Meaning and Intentionality\n\nPhilosophers of mind often divide the problems of physicalism into\ntwo: first, there are the problems of qualia, typified by the\nknowledge argument; second, there are problems of intentionality. The\nintentionality of mental states is their aboutness, their capacity to\nrepresent the world as being a certain way. One does not simply think,\none thinks of (or about) Vienna; similarly, one does\nnot simply believe, one believes that snow is white. Just as\nin the case of qualia, some of the puzzles of intentionality derive\nfrom facts internal to the notion, and from the relation of this\nnotion to the others such as rationality, inference and language; see\n Intentionality.\n But others derive from the fact that it seems difficult to square the\nfact that mental states have intentionality with physicalism. There\nare a number of ways of developing this criticism but much recent work\nhas concentrated on a certain line of argument that Saul Kripke has\nfound in the work of Wittgenstein (1982; see also\n Private Language).\n\nKripke\u2019s argument is best approached by first considering what\nis often called a dispositional theory of linguistic meaning.\nAccording to the dispositional theory, a word means what it does\n\u2014 for example, the word \u2018red\u2019 means red \u2014\nbecause speakers of the word are disposed to apply to word to red\nthings. Now, for a number of reasons, this sort of theory has been\nvery popular among physicalists. First, the concept of a disposition\nat issue here is clearly a concept that is compatible with\nphysicalism. After all, the mere fact that vases are fragile and sugar\ncubes are soluble (both are classic examples of dispositional\nproperties) does not cause a problem for physicalism, so why should\nthe idea that human beings have similar dispositional properties?\nSecond, it seems possible to develop the dispositional theory of\nlinguistic meaning so that it might apply also to intentionality.\nAccording to a dispositional theory of intentionality, a mental\nconcept would mean what it does because thinkers are disposed to\nemploy the concept in thought in a certain way. So a dispositional\ntheory seems to hold out the best promise of a theory of\nintentionality that is compatible with physicalism.\n\nKripke\u2019s argument is designed to destroy that promise. (In fact,\nKripke\u2019s argument is designed to destroy considerably more than\nthis: the conclusion of his argument is a paradoxical one to the\neffect that there can be no such a thing as a word\u2019s having a\nmeaning. However, we will concentrate on the aspects of the argument\nthat bear on physicalism.) In essence his argument is this. Imagine a\nsituation in which (a) the dispositional theory is true; (b) the word\n\u2018red\u2019 means red for a speaker S; and yet (c) the speaker\nmisapplies the word \u2014 for example, S is looking at a white thing\nthrough rose-tinted spectacles and calls it red. Now, in that\nsituation, it would seem that S is disposed to apply \u2018red\u2019\nto things which are (not merely red but)\neither-red-or-white-but-seen-through-rose-tinted-spectacles. But then,\nby the theory, the word \u2018red\u2019 means (not red but)\neither-red-or-white-as-seen-through-rose-tinted-spectacles. But that\ncontradicts our initial claim (b), that \u2018red\u2019 means red.\nIn other words, the dispositional theory, when combined with a true\nclaim about the meaning of word, plus a truism about meaning \u2014\nthat people can misapply meaningful words \u2014 leads to a\ncontradiction and is therefore false.\n\nHow might a physicalist respond to Kripke\u2019s argument? As with\nthe knowledge argument, there are many responses but here I will\nmention only two. The first response is to insist that Kripke\u2019s\nargument neglects the distinction between a priori and a\nposteriori physicalism. Kripke often does say that according to\nthe dispositionalist, one should be able to \u2018read off\u2019\ntruths about meaning from truths a physicalist can accept. (For a\nproposal like this, see Horwich 2000.) One problem with this proposal\nis, as we have seen, that its background account of the necessary\na posteriori is controversial. As we saw, a\nposteriori physicalists are committed to what we called the\nnon-derivation view about necessary a posteriori truths. But\nthe non-derivation view has come under attack in recent times.\n\nThe second response is to defend the dispositional theory against\nKripke\u2019s argument. One way to do this is to argue that the\nargument only works against a very simple dispositionalism, and that a\nmore complicated version of such a theory would avoid these problems.\n(For a proposal along these lines, see Fodor 1992 and the discussion\nin Braddon-Mitchell and Jackson 1996). A different proposal is to\nargue that Kripke\u2019s argument underestimates the complexity in\nthe notion of a disposition. The mere fact that in certain\ncircumstances someone would apply \u2018red\u2019 to white things\ndoes not mean that they are disposed to apply red to white things\n\u2014 after all, the mere fact that in certain circumstances\nsomething would burn does not mean that it is flammable in the\nordinary sense. (For a proposal along these lines see Hohwy 1998, and\nHeil and Martin 1998)\n\nAs with the knowledge argument, the issues surrounding Kripke\u2019s\nargument are very much wide open. But it is important to note that\nmost philosophers don\u2019t consider the issues of intentionality as\nseriously as the issue of qualia when it comes to physicalism. In\ndifferent vocabularies, for example, both Block (1995) and Chalmers\n(1996) distinguish between the intentional aspects of the mind or\nconsciousness, and the phenomenal aspects or qualia, and suggest that\nit is really the latter that is the central issue. As Chalmers notes\n(1996; p. 24), echoing Chomsky\u2019s famous distinction, the\nintentionality issue is a problem, but the qualia issue is a\nmystery.\n",
