    "main_text": "\n\nIsaac Albalag stands out as one of the most rigorous representatives\nof the school of Jewish Averroism which flourished in Western Europe\nin the thirteenth century and lasted until the Renaissance. The\nmembers of this school, such as Ibn Kaspi, Shem Tov Ibn Falaquera,\nMoses Narboni, Isaac Polqar, Gersonides, and Elijah Delmedigo,\nregarded Averroes\u2019 philosophical writings, particularly his\ncommentaries on Aristotle, as the main source for the study of\nscience and philosophy. The impact of Averroes on these philosophers,\nvaried as it was, extended to the question of the relationship between\nreligion and philosophy. Many Jewish philosophers, drawing upon\nAverroes\u2019 religious epistemology, which established a\ntheoretical basis for reading Scripture and demonstrative sciences as\ndifferent representations of the truth rather than conflicting truths,\nundertook to interpret Judaism as a philosophical religion, a\nphilosophical-religious approach that was arguably championed by the\nprominent Jewish philosopher Maimonides (d.1204). Like most Jewish\nAverroists, Albalag occupied himself with purely philosophical\nquestions of physics, metaphysics, and epistemology, addressing them\nthrough the lens of Averroes. Characteristically, Albalag holds\nunreserved admiration for and faithfulness to Aristotle whose\nteachings he deems synonymous with the truth and which he\ndiscovers in the writings of Averroes. Restoring Aristotelianism and\nestablishing it among Jewish students of philosophy emerge as key\ngoals of Albalag\u2019s philosophical enterprise. Within the\nframework of that enterprise, Albalag also engages with the crucial\nquestion of the relationship between Judaism and philosophy, uniquely\nanswering it by advocating the double truth doctrine.\n",
