    "main_text": "Do Types Exist? || Realism\n7.2 Realism\n\n\nRealism is the most natural view in the debate with nominalism,\nbecause as we saw in some detail in \u00a72 type talk is\nubiquitous. That is, we talk as though there are types in philosophy,\nscience and everyday life. To say that we talk as though there are\ntypes is not to invoke the traditional argument for universals, which\nis that a sunset and a rose are both red, so they have something in\ncommon; and this something can only be the property of being\nred; so properties exist. Quine (1953) convinced many at\nmid-century that this traditional argument for universals, which\nrelies on predicates referring to something, fails. He objected that\n\u201cthe rose is red because the rose partakes of redness\u201d is\nuninformative\u2014we are no better off in terms of explanatory power\nwith such extra objects as redness than we are without them;\nperhaps a rose's being red and a sunset's being red are just brute\nfacts. Rather, to say we talk as though there are types is, as we saw\nin \u00a72, to appeal to the fact that in our theories we frequently\nuse singular terms for types, and we quantify over them. As we saw,\nFrege emphasized that singular term usage is in indicator of\nobjecthood, and Quine stressed that we are ontologically\ncommitted to that over which we quantify.  Such considerations led\nQuine himself (1987, p. 217) to hold that expression types such as\n\u2018red\u2019 exist, even while he denied that redness\ndoes. Since at least on the face of it we are committed to types in\nmany fields of inquiry, therefore, it is incumbent upon the nominalist\nto \u201canalyze them away\u201d. (Or to maintain that all theories\nwhich appear to refer to types are false\u2014but this is a pretty\nradical approach, which will be ignored below.)\n",
