    "main_text": "The Limits of Cognitive Success || General Skepticism and Selective Skepticism\n6.1 General Skepticism and Selective Skepticism\n\nMuch of modern epistemology aims to address one or another kind of\nskepticism. Skepticism is a challenge to our pre-philosophical\nconception of ourselves as cognitively successful beings. Such\nchallenges come in many varieties. One way in which these varieties\ndiffer concerns the different kinds of cognitive success that they\ntarget: skepticism can challenge our claims to know, or our\nclaims to believe justifiably, or our claims to have\njustification for believing, or our claims to have any\ngood reasons for belief whatsoever. But another way in which\nthese varieties differ is in whether the skepticism in question is\nfully general\u2014targeting the possibility of enjoying any instance\nof the relevant cognitive success\u2014or is\nselective\u2014targeting the possibility of enjoying the relevant\ncognitive success concerning a particular subject matter (e.g., the\npast, the minds of others, the world beyond our own consciousness) or\nconcerning beliefs formed by a particular method (e.g., perception,\nmemory, reasoning, etc.). General skepticism and selective skepticism\npose very different sorts of challenges, and use very different kinds\nof arguments. General skepticism is motivated by reasoning from some\napparently conflicting features of the kind of cognitive success in\nquestion. For instance, a general skeptic might claim that\njustification requires a regress of justifiers, but then argue that\nthis regress of justifiers cannot be contained in any finite\nmind\u2014and thus, the skeptic might conclude, no finite being can\nbe justified in believing anything. Alternatively a general skeptic\nmight claim that knowledge requires certainty, and that nobody can be\ncertain of something unless there is nothing of which she could be\neven more certain\u2014thus, the skeptic might conclude, we can know\nvirtually nothing (see Unger 1975).\n\nSelective skepticism, in contrast, is typically motivated by appeal to\none or another skeptical hypothesis. A skeptical hypothesis is a\nhypothesis according to which the facts that you claim to know\n(whether these facts concern the past, or the mind of others, or the\nmind-independent world, or what have you) may, for all you can tell,\nbe radically different from how they appear to you to be. Thus, a\nskeptical hypothesis is a hypothesis that distinguishes between the\nway things appear to you, on the one hand, and the way they really\nare, on the other; and this distinction is deployed in such a way as\nto pose a challenge to your cognitive success concerning the latter.\nHere are some famous examples of skeptical hypotheses:\n\nAll the other humans around me are automata who simply act exactly\nas if they have thoughts and feelings.\nThe whole universe was created no more than 5 minutes ago, replete\nwith fake memories and other misleading evidence concerning a distant\npast.\nI\u2019m lying in my bed dreaming everything that I\u2019m aware\nof right now.\nI\u2019m a mere brain-in-a-vat (a BIV, for short) being\nelectrochemically stimulated to have all these states of mind that\nI\u2019m now having.\n\n\nSkeptics can make use of such hypotheses in constructing various\narguments that challenge our pre-philosophical picture of ourselves as\ncognitively successful. Consider, for instance, the BIV hypothesis,\nand some ways in which this hypothesis can be employed in a skeptical\nargument.\n\nHere is one way of doing so. According to the BIV hypothesis, the\nexperiences you would have as a BIV and the experiences you have as a\nnormal person are perfectly alike, indistinguishable, so to speak,\n\u201cfrom the inside\u201d. Thus, although it appears to you as if\nyou are a normally embodied human being, everything would appear\nexactly the same way to a BIV. Thus, the way things appear to you\ncannot provide you with knowledge that you are not a BIV. But if the\nway things appear to you cannot provide you with such knowledge, then\nnothing can give you such knowledge, and so you cannot know that\nyou\u2019re not a BIV. Of course, you already know this much: if you\nare a BIV, then you don\u2019t have any hands. If you don\u2019t\nknow that you\u2019re not a BIV, then you don\u2019t know that\nyou\u2019re not in a situation in which you don\u2019t have any\nhands. But if you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re not in a\nsituation in which you don\u2019t have any hands, then you\ndon\u2019t know that you\u2019re not handless. And to not know that\nyou\u2019re not handless is simply to not know that you have hands.\nWe can summarize this skeptical argument as follows:\n\n\nThe BIV-Knowledge Closure Argument (BKCA)\n\n(C1) I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not a\nBIV.\n(C2) If I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m not\na BIV, then I don\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(C3) I don\u2019t know that I have\nhands.\n\n\n\nAs we have just seen, (C1) and (C2) are very plausible\npremises. It would seem, therefore, that BKCA is sound. If it is, we\nmust conclude we don\u2019t know we have hands. But surely that\nconclusion can\u2019t be right: if it turns out that I don\u2019t\nknow that I have hands, that must be because of something very\npeculiar about my cognitive relation to the issue of whether I have\nhands\u2014not because of the completely anodyne\nconsiderations mentioned in BKCA. So we are confronted with a\ndifficult challenge: The conclusion of the BKCA seems plainly false,\nbut on what grounds can we reject\n it?[61]\n\nHere are some other ways of using the BIV hypothesis to generate a\nskeptical argument.\n\n\nThe BIV-Justification Underdetermination Argument\n(BJUA)\n\n(U1) The way things appear to me could be\nequally well explained by the BIV hypothesis as by my ordinary beliefs\nthat things appear to me the way they do because I perceive\nmind-independent objects.\n(U2) If the way things appear to me could be\nequally well explained by either of two hypotheses, then I am not\njustified in believing one of those hypotheses rather than the\nother.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(U3) I am not justified in believing that I\nperceive mind-independent objects.\n\n\n\n\nThe BIV-Knowledge Defeasibility Argument (BKDA)\n\n(D1) If I know that I have hands, then I know that\nany evidence indicating that I don\u2019t have hands is misleading\nevidence.\n(D2) If I know that some evidence is misleading, then\nI know that I should disregard that evidence.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(D3) If I know that I have hands, then I know that I\nshould disregard any evidence to the contrary.\n(D4) I do not know that I should disregard any\nevidence to the contrary.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(D5) I do not know that I have hands.\n\n\n\n\nThe BIV-Epistemic Possibility Argument (BEPA)\n\n(P1) It\u2019s at least possible that\nI\u2019m a BIV.\n(P2) If it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m a BIV, then\nit\u2019s possible that I don\u2019t have hands.\n(P3) If it\u2019s possible that I don\u2019t have\nhands, then I don\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\nTherefore:\n\n(P4) I don\u2019t know that I have hands.\n\n\n\nObviously, this list of skeptical arguments could be extended by\nvarying either (a) the skeptical hypothesis employed, or (b) the kind\nof cognitive success being challenged, or (c) the epistemological\nprinciples that link the hypothesis in (a) and the challenge in (b).\nSome of the resulting skeptical arguments are more plausible than\nothers, and some are historically more prominent than others, but\nthere isn\u2019t space for a comprehensive survey. Here, we will\nreview some of the more influential replies to BKCA, BJUA, BKDA, and\nBEPA.\n",
