    "main_text": "Influential approaches to economic methodology || The rhetoric of economics\n4.2 The rhetoric of economics\n\nOne radical reaction to the difficulties of justifying the reliance on\nsevere simplifications is to deny that economics passes methodological\nmuster. Alexander Rosenberg (1992) maintains that economics can only\nmake imprecise generic predictions, and it cannot make progress,\nbecause it is built around folk psychology, which is a mediocre theory\nof human behavior and which (owing to the irreducibility of\nintentional notions) cannot be improved. Complex economic theories are\nscientifically valuable only as applied mathematics, not as empirical\ntheory. Since economics does not show the same consistent progress as\nthe natural sciences, one cannot dismiss Rosenberg\u2019s suggestion\nthat economics is an empirical dead end. But his view that it has made\nno progress and that it does not permit quantitative\npredictions is hard to accept. For example, contemporary economists\nare much better at pricing stock options or designing auctions than\neconomists were even a generation ago.\n\nAn equally radical but opposite reaction is Deirdre McCloskey\u2019s,\nwho denies that there are any non-trivial methodological standards\nthat economics must meet (1985, 1992, 1994, 2000, McCloskey and Ziliak\n2003, Ziliak and McCloskey 2008). In her view, the only relevant and\nsignificant criteria for assessing the practices and products of a\ndiscipline are those accepted by the practitioners. Apart from a few\ngeneral standards such as honesty and a willingness to listen to\ncriticisms, the only justifiable criteria for any conversation are\nthose of the participants. Economists can thus dismiss the arrogant\npretensions of philosophers to judge economic discourse. Whatever a\ngroup of respected economists takes to be good economics is\nautomatically good economics. Philosophical standards of empirical\nsuccess are just so much hot air. Those who are interested in\nunderstanding the character of economics and in contributing to its\nimprovement should eschew methodology and study instead the\n\u201crhetoric\u201d of economics \u2014 that is, the means of\nargument and persuasion that succeed among economists.\n\nMcCloskey\u2019s studies of the rhetoric of economics have been\nvaluable and influential (1985, esp. ch. 5\u20137, McCloskey and\nZiliak 2003, Ziliak and McCloskey 2008), but a great deal of her work\nduring the 1980s and 1990s consists of philosophical critiques of\neconomic methodology rather than studies of the rhetoric of economics.\nHer philosophical critiques are problematic, because the position\nsketched in the previous paragraph is hard to defend and potentially\nself-defeating. It is hard to defend, because epistemological\nstandards have already influenced the conversation of economists. The\nstandards of predictive success which lead one to have qualms about\neconomics are already standards that many economists accept. The only\nway to escape these doubts is to surrender the standards that gave\nrise to them. But McCloskey\u2019s position undermines any principled\nargument for a change in standards. Furthermore, as Rosenberg has\nargued (1988), it seems that economists would doom themselves to\nirrelevance if they were to surrender standards of predictive success,\nfor it is upon such standards that policy decisions are made.\n\nMcCloskey does not, in fact, want to preclude the possibiity that\neconomists are sometimes persuaded when they should not be or are not\npersuaded when they should be. For she herself criticizes the bad\nhabit some economists have of conflating statistical significance with\neconomic importance (1985, ch. 9, McCloskey and Ziliak 2003, Ziliak\nand McCloskey 2008). McCloskey typically characterizes rhetoric\ndescriptively as the study of what in fact persuades, but sometimes\nshe instead characterizes it normatively as the study of what ought to\npersuade (1985, ch. 2). And if rhetoric is the study of what\nought rationally to persuade, then it is methodology, not an\nalternative to methodology. Questions about whether economics is a\nsuccessful empirical science cannot be conjured away.\n",
