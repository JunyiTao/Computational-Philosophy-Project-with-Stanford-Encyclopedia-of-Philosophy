Divine Knowledge and the Problem of Future Contingents\n\nThe Preacher in Ecclesiastes gives eloquent expression to\nworld-weariness by saying that there is nothing new under the sun.\nNevertheless, process thought reminds us that there was once a time\nwhen the sun itself was new. We noted earlier that in process\nmetaphysics, time is the process of creation. The universe is not a\ntotality, fixed once and for all, but a dynamic vector growing from a\ndeterminate past into an open (partly indeterminate) future. We have\nalso seen that process theism conceives God as being really related to\nthe world through prehensions or feelings. If divine knowing is\nconsidered perfect, then it follows from these premises that God knows\nthe past as fully determinate (as created), the present as the process\nof determination (as being created), and the future as partly\nindeterminate (as yet to be created). Some have criticized process\ntheism for advocating a limited God who is ignorant of the future.\nProcess theists reply that this is incorrect and represents a subtle\nbegging of the question. The question is not whether God knows a fully\ndeterminate future but whether there is a fully determinate future to\nknow. It is the nature of time, not the nature of divine knowing, that\nis at issue. If the future exists as partially indeterminate,\nunsettled, or uncreated, then a perfect knower must know it as\nsuch.\n\nThe fact that process theism construes God\u2019s knowledge as\nprehensive means that it is a mistake to interpret it solely in terms\nof the information content of declarative sentences. This is not to\nsay that God does not have this information, but it is well to keep in\nmind that omniscience, for process theism, is more akin to what\nBertrand Russell calls knowledge by acquaintance than it is to\nknowledge by description (Hartshorne 1941, 241). Divine prehensions of\nthe world include not only information but affective tone (Whitehead\ncalls it the \u201csubjective form\u201d of prehensions);\nGod\u2019s knowledge is empathetic, feeling the feelings of the\ncreatures. Again, this contrasts with the traditional account of\nomniscience which \u201cattributes to God the informational content\nof our perceptions without the hedonistic content\u201d (Kenny 1979,\n32). E. S. Brightman (Auxier and Davies 2001, 43, 70), Henri\nSimoni-Wastila (1999), and Auxier and Herstein (2017, 264) argue that\nclaiming this kind of knowledge for God is excessive, for it would\nmean, for example, that in knowing a creature\u2019s fear of death,\nGod would also fear death. Hartshorne\u2019s response is that God\nfeels how we feel without feeling as we feel,\nsimilar to the way in which persons can vividly remember emotions they\nonce experienced without actually having those emotions as their own\nin the present experience of memory (Hartshorne 1984b, 199). This\nissue highlights a tension between Whitehead and Hartshorne. Whitehead\nspeaks of an actual entity\u2019s subjectivity as\n\u201cperishing\u201d as it becomes past, but Hartshorne insists\nthat the divine memory preserves the immediacy of our experiences,\nmaking them objectively immortal (Whitehead 1929 [1978, 351]; Hartshorne\n1970, 118).\n\nProcess theism provides an account of the mechanics of\nomniscience\u2014that is, an account of how God knows the\nworld\u2014that fits well with analogies drawn from experience. Apart\nfrom complications introduced by quantum physics, events do not occur\nbecause we know about them; we know about them, in part, because they\noccur. Process theism applies the same logic to God. This account\ndiffers from traditional views in two important ways. First, many\ntheists follow Aquinas in reversing the cognitive relation in God. For\nAquinas, God knows events in the world because God is their cause\n(Summa Theologica I, Q. 14, a. 11). This allows Aquinas to\naffirm omniscience while denying real relations in God; however, it\nalso makes an unambiguous affirmation of the contingency of creaturely\ndecisions difficult if not impossible, as we have already seen in our\ndiscussion of God and creativity. Second, the process view contradicts\nthe Boethian concept of eternity as a non-temporal viewpoint on\ntemporal events. For Boethius (and for Aquinas) events in time are\nrelated to God as the points on the circumference of a circle are\nrelated to its center (Consolation of Philosophy, bk 5, prose\n6; Summa Contra Gentiles I, ch. 66, para. 7). For process\nthought, time is more like a line being added to from moment to\nmoment, but never complete, so there is no vantage from which it can\nbe taken in all at once (Hartshorne 1945, 284).\n\nThere are peculiarities in traditional metaphors for omniscience that\nprocess thought rejects. God, it was said, \u201csees\u201d all of\ntime in one eternal instant; yet seeing, like knowing, requires real\nrelations in the perceiver; moreover, one cannot see as fully\nactualized that which is still only possibly to be actualized, that is\nto say, the partially indeterminate future. It is noteworthy, however,\nthat process theism retains one element of the traditional view. We\nhave seen that Hartshorne attributes the laws of nature to an act of\nGod. For this reason, God knows the extent to which the future is\nopen\u2014what the laws allow and what they do not allow. The process\nGod must also be aware of the conditions that creaturely decisions set\nupon future actualization, opening up some possibilities and closing\nothers.\n\nProcess theists were not the first to notice the problems that the\nThomistic account poses for human freedom. William of Ockham, for\nexample, despaired of explaining how God could come to know the future\nfree decisions of the creatures (Shields 1993, 298). Luis de Molina\ndeveloped the chief rival in classical theism to Aquinas\u2019s\naccount of the mechanics of omniscience. Molinism has been much\ndiscussed in recent literature and vigorously defended (Shields &\nViney 2004, 241, n. 15). Molina claims that there are true statements\nabout what any possible creature would freely do in any\nsituation in which that creature existed. The truth of these\nstatements, called \u201cmiddle knowledge conditionals,\u201d is\ndecided by neither God nor the creatures; they are simply eternally\ntrue, a kind of innate divine knowledge. Molina agrees with Aquinas\nthat the deity knows the product of its own creative\nactivity\u2014called \u201cfree knowledge\u201d (Kenny 1979, 62).\nUsing free knowledge, in conjunction with middle knowledge\nconditionals, God can deduce what any actual creature will freely\ndo. The deduction has the form: \u201cIf individual X\nwere in situation S, then X would freely decide\nA\u201d (middle knowledge conditional); and\n\u201cX is in S\u201d (God\u2019s free\nknowledge); therefore, \u201cX will freely decide\nA.\u201d Molina\u2019s theory is designed to save both the\nfreedom of the creatures and the divine immutability and\nimpassibility. Thus, it poses as much of a challenge to process theism\nas does Thomism which claims for itself the same advantages.\n\nNeither Whitehead nor Hartshorne addresses Molinism, but process\nmetaphysics provides resources for a number of criticisms (Shields\n& Viney 2004, 225\u2013233). One objection is that Molinism\nendows God with an innate knowledge of an elaborate set of contingent\ntruths which have no explanation. Yet, contingent truths are precisely\nthe sorts of truths for which we legitimately seek\nexplanations\u2014indeed, this is one of the marks of contingency\n(Hartshorne 1962, 74). A related problem is that the distinction\nbetween the possible and the actual is finessed. It is common to refer\nto what an actual individual would do in a certain\ncircumstance, for one can speak of that individual\u2019s\ndispositions and character as so far formed. To refer to what a\npossible individual would do is entirely different. Possible\nindividuals are either fictional (like Sherlock Holmes) or they are\ntied to the creative powers of the actual world (like a child yet to\nbe conceived). The properties of fictional characters are defined by\nsomeone\u2019s imagination and so there is no fixed truth about what\nthey would do. Arguably, persons yet to be conceived can only be said\nto have the properties that link them to the reproductive\npotentialities of actual persons. Thus, most babies have the capacity\nto grow up to become parents themselves. What may the first child\n(call it Chris) of a particular newborn (call it Kim) be like? The\nmost that can be said with certainty is that half of Chris\u2019s\nchromosomes will be inherited from Kim. To speak informatively about\nwhat Chris would do under any given circumstances presupposes\nuncountable human decisions and years of development beyond\nKim\u2019s own childhood.\n\nA third and final criticism of Molinism, from a process perspective,\nis that it doesn\u2019t really preserve the freedom of the creatures\nin the way it claims. Molina verbally accepts the idea that one is\nsignificantly free only if one could have done otherwise in the same\ncircumstances (in the literature this is called incompatibilist\nfreedom). For example, if Oswald\u2019s assassination of President\nKennedy was a genuinely free act then if, per impossibile,\nthe clock could be turned back to the moments before the murder,\nOswald could have decided not to pull the trigger. Alternately stated,\nOswald\u2019s not pulling the trigger in the exact situation where he\nin fact did pull the trigger could have become actual. In\nHartshorne\u2019s view, and as far as incompatibilist freedom is\nconcerned, to be actually possible is to be (or to have been)\npossibly actual. On Molinist principles, it is difficult to see\nhow Oswald\u2019s not pulling the trigger in those circumstances\ncould have become actual. It is true that, in Molina\u2019s view,\nthere is no contradiction in conceiving Oswald in those circumstances\nnot pulling the trigger. But, given the set of middle knowledge\nconditionals about Oswald, Oswald\u2019s not pulling the trigger\nhappens in no world that God can create (this is not to say that if a\ndifferent set of middle knowledge conditionals were true of Oswald God\ncould not create those possible worlds). The events, however, that can\nbecome actual, that are actually possible, are events in universes\ncreated by God. Since, under the assumption of the set of middle\nknowledge conditionals we know to be true of Oswald, no universe that\ncould be created by God\u2014no possible actuality\u2014is one in\nwhich Oswald freely refrains from pulling the trigger, Oswald\u2019s\nact cannot be considered a free act. Of course, it may be the case\nthat the set of middle knowledge conditionals concerning Oswald are\nsuch that he could have refrained from pulling the trigger had God\ncreated a slightly different universe; but it is Oswald\u2019s\nfreedom in the actual universe that is at issue.\n\nThe problems of the mechanics of omniscience aside, the traditional\ntheist might argue that the process view of God\u2019s knowledge is\nproblematic because it either limits God\u2019s knowledge or it\nviolates elementary principles of logic. The argument is apparently\nstraightforward. Every proposition of the form, \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d is true because one or the other side of the\ndisjunction is true. To use Aristotle\u2019s example from De\nInterpretatione IX, either a sea battle will occur tomorrow or it\nwill not. Let p represent \u201cA sea battle will occur\ntomorrow\u201d and not-p, \u201cA sea battle will not occur\ntomorrow.\u201d In that case, \u201cA sea battle will occur tomorrow\nor a sea battle will not occur tomorrow\u201d is a tautology and\nhence true. If God does not know which side of the disjunction is true\nthen God\u2019s knowledge is limited. If the disjunction itself is\nnot true then some tautologies are false. Any theory that commits one\nto the falsity of some tautologies flaunts the fundamental principles\nof logic and thereby faces a steep burden of proof.\n\nAristotle apparently believed that, where future contingents are\nconcerned, \u201cp or not-p\u201d is true but the\ntwo halves of the disjunction have indeterminate truth values. This\nidea seems logically counter-intuitive. If p and\nnot-p are indeterminate, shouldn\u2019t \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d also be indeterminate? For a brief period,\nHartshorne defended the Aristotelian idea (Hartshorne 1939), but he\ndiscovered a more parsimonious solution (Hartshorne 2011c, 123).\nInstead of locating the indeterminacy of the future in truth values,\nhe focused on predicates that reflect the extent to which the future\nis open for any given event. Either all causal conditions are such\nthat the sea battle will occur, or no causal conditions are such that\nit will occur, or it is permitted by some but not all causal\nconditions (cf. Hartshorne 1970, 145). It \u201cwill\u201d occur\nmeans that all the possibilities for tomorrow which are still left\nopen involve the occurrence in question; while it \u201cmay\u201d\noccur means that some of the open possibilities involve the\noccurrence; and it \u201cwill not\u201d occur means that none of the\npossibilities involve it (Hartshorne 1941, 100).\n\nAlthough Hartshorne rejected Aristotle\u2019s view on future\ncontingents, his solution to the problem that Aristotle tried to solve\nneatly parallels Aristotle\u2019s square. \u201cZ will\noccur\u201d and \u201cZ will not occur\u201d are\ncontraries\u2014they may both be false but they cannot both be true.\nThe contradictory of \u201cZ will occur\u201d is\n\u201cZ may not occur\u201d; similarly, the contradictory\nof \u201cZ will not occur\u201d is \u201cZ may\noccur.\u201d In A Christmas Carol, Scrooge presupposes this\nschema when he asks the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, \u201cAre\nthese the shadows of the things that Will be or the shadows of things\nthat May be, only?\u201d Of this example, Hartshorne said,\n\u201cThere is a master of language [i.e. Dickens]. Will and May are\nnicely distinguished in ordinary speech\u201d (Hartshorne & Viney\n2001, 39).\n\nHartshorne maintains that, \u201cthe semantic analysis of truth with\nreference to future events should not be so formulated as to make\n\u2018will\u2019 and \u2018will not\u2019 the sole\npossibilities\u201d (Hartshorne 2011a, 83). Following\nHartshorne\u2019s suggestion, George Shields says that,\n\u201cZ will occur\u201d and \u201cZ will not\noccur\u201d should not be symbolized in the propositional calculus as\np and not-p but as p and q, where\n\u201cIf p then not-q\u201d and \u201cIf\nq then not-p.\u201d The conjunction of these\npropositions, \u201cIf p then not-q and if\nq then not-p\u201d mirrors the truth value\nsemantics of contrariety, not contradiction, which is mirrored by\n\u201cIt is false that \u2018p if and only if\nq,\u2019\u201d or exclusive disjunction. Shields argues\nthat it is question begging to assume that \u201cZ will or\nwill not occur\u201d must be an instance of \u201cp or\nnot-p\u201d. The question at issue is the formalization of\nfuture tense statements; thus, it will not do to assume that verb\ntense makes no difference in the formalization (Shields & Viney\n2004, 220).\n",
