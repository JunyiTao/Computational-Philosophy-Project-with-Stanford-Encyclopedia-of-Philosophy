    "main_text": "\n\nMany biologists and commentators from the humanities and social\nsciences have questioned whether the gene is still a useful category\nin biology. Too many times have the entities and processes associated\nwith the term turned out to be more diverse and more complex than\ninitially assumed, and it seemed that new terms were needed to\naccommodate new insights. And yet, the term \u201cgene\u201d has\nproved to be persistent. It remains central not only in public\ndiscourse about biology and in educational contexts, but also for\nresearchers at the cutting edge of the life sciences in framing their\nresults and interpretations.\n\nTo understand this seemingly paradoxical situation, it is worthwhile\nto reflect on the nature of scientific concepts. Most, if not all\nscientific concepts are historically constituted, i.e., they are\nneither given once, with a unique and stable meaning attached to them\nand either remain in discourse unchanged or disappear entirely, nor\nare they merely subject of historical development in the sense of\nprogressing towards some final, stable meaning. Instead, concepts are\n\u201cin flux\u201d; they change their meaning in the course of\nongoing investigation (Elkana 1970). Additionally, when the\ninvestigative projects associated with a concept diversify, concepts\nmay at any point in history exhibit several related but still\ndifferent meanings in various local contexts. In each context, the\nconcept might be more or less well defined, but overall, or at the\nboundaries between different fields of research, concepts will be\nperceived as rather vague (L\u00f6wy 1992). Furthermore, scientific\nconcepts do not stand isolated; they belong to conceptual systems,\ndiscourses, and practices (Foucault 1971; Kuhn 1962; Lynch 1993).\nIndeed, what it means for a concept to change its meaning is that the\ncontext of use for a given concept or its relations to other concepts\nchange. All of the above applies to the gene concept, which has been\ndescribed as a \u201cconcept in flux\u201d (Falk 1986), a fuzzy,\nvague, or boundary concept (Rheinberger 2000), and a \u201cconcept in\ntension\u201d (Falk 2000), and studied as part of various discourses\n(Jacob 1970 [1973]; Keller 2000) or in the context of broader cultural\nspheres and practices (M\u00fcller-Wille & Rheinberger 2012).\n\nThe first part of this entry provides a historical overview, which\nserves as a background to understand philosophical accounts of\nscientific change with respect to genetics addressed in the second\npart. Section 2.1 will discuss models of theory reduction in genetics.\nSections 2.2 and 2.3 will address discussions of change and\ndiversification in the meaning and reference of the term\n\u201cgene\u201d. Because of its central role in most areas of\nbiology, the gene concept also has a central role in debates in\nphilosophy of biology (see entries on\n philosophy of biology\n and \n feminist philosophy of biology).\n This entry focusses on the gene\nconcept in studies of heredity and development. Additional\nphilosophical problems concerning the concept of genetic information,\ncausation, and determinism are covered in entries on\n biological information,\n genetics,\n molecular genetics,\n molecular biology,\n the distinction between innate and acquired characteristics,\n and\n the human genome project\n (see also Griffiths & Stotz 2013). For conceptual questions\npertaining to genes as central units of evolution, the reader is\nreferred to the entries on\n evolution,\n ecological genetics,\n population genetics,\n genetic drift,\n units and levels of selection,\n and\n replication and reproduction\n (see also Sterelny & Griffiths 1999).\n",
