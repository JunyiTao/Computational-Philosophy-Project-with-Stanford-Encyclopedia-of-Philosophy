    "main_text": "\n\nHermann von Helmholtz (1821\u20131894) participated in two of the\nmost significant developments in physics and in the philosophy of\nscience in the 19th century: the proof that Euclidean geometry does\nnot describe the only possible visualizable and physical space, and\nthe shift from physics based on actions between particles at a\ndistance to the field theory. Helmholtz achieved a staggering number\nof scientific results, including the formulation of energy\nconservation, the vortex equations for fluid dynamics, the notion of\nfree energy in thermodynamics, and the invention of the\nophthalmoscope. His constant interest in the epistemology of science\nguarantees his enduring significance for philosophy.\n",
