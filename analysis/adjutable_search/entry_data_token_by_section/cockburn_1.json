    "main_text": "Life\n2. Philosophy\n\nAlthough primarily concerned with moral issues, Cockburn philosophical\nwritings (which are taken here to include The Defence of Mr.\nLocke\u2019s Essay of Human Understanding (hereafter referred to\nas the Defence), Remarks upon some Writers and\nRemarks upon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr.\nRutherforth\u2019s Essay) address a range of philosophical\nissues. In the Defence, she addresses a series of issues\nsurrounding Locke\u2019s empiricism, which include not only moral\nknowledge, but also the knowledge humans can have of God\u2019s\nveracity and of the immortality of the human soul. There is also a\nbroad range of topics addressed in her work Remarks upon some\nWriters, in which Cockburn begins by addressing several\nphilosophical issues \u2013 necessity, the infinitude of space, and\nthe nature and existence of spirits with regard to the notion of\nsubstance. The latter discussion revolves generally around\nepistemological concerns regarding the knowledge of real essences and\nthe nature of substance, in which she argues that spirits must have\nextension of a sort in order to be proper substances. She makes this\nargument by appeal to a broadly Lockean view regarding substance.\n\nHowever, it is her moral theory that is most prominently emphasized\nthroughout her works. Cockburn was mainly concerned with grappling\nwith the defects and strengths of some of the predominating issues in\nmoral theory at this time. Cockburn\u2019s own position is an amalgam\nof three dominant strains of eighteenth-century morality: moral\nrationalism, moral fitness theory and moral sense theory. Moral\nrationalism is, broadly speaking, the view that morality is the result\nof a rational process, whereby the mind reasons about moral ideas and\ncreates moral rules (although many thinkers, like Cockburn, argued\nthat the mind, by this process, is actually in some way discovering\neternal moral rules). Moral fitness theory is a rationalist theory\nthat includes the notion that the human mind is able to grasp the\nvarious moral relations that result from the essential natures of\nthings in the universe; e.g., the nature of humans and God creates a\nrelation that necessitates the allegiance of humans to their superior\n(this view was made most famous by Samuel Clarke). Moral sense theory\nis the view that humans possess a special sensory ability that can\ndetermine, pre-rationally, what is good or evil (This view was made\nmost famous by Shaftesbury and Hutcheson). However, for many\ntheorists, like Cockburn, this sensory information is not definitive\n\u2013 but is seen as an aid to moralizing that can, and should, be\ncorrected by reason.\n\nMuch of the groundwork for her view is laid in the Defence.\nThis was written as a response to the Remarks Upon an Essay\nConcerning Humane Understanding, a series of three pamphlets\npublished between 1697 and 1699 that aimed to expose the deficiencies\nof Locke\u2019s empiricism. The Remarks were published\nanonymously and their authorship has been the source of some\ncontroversy. Long thought to have been written by Thomas Burnet, this\nattribution has recently been challenged (see Walmsley, et al.,\n2016); the author shall be referred to here as the Remarker. The\nRemarks raised doubts concerning the tenability of\nLocke\u2019s epistemology as a foundation for, among other things,\nmoral knowledge. In the Essay and other works, Locke had\nsuggested that morality could be known by reason and had emphasized\nthe demonstrative character of morality \u2013 thereby making a claim\nto the certainty with which moral ideas could be known. However, Locke\nnever provided an explicit account of how fundamental moral ideas are\nderived. The Remarker concludes that Locke\u2019s epistemology is\nsimply insufficient to the task, and that moral ideas, on\nLocke\u2019s system, remain as uncertain as the ideas of God\u2019s\nnature and the immortality of the soul. The Remarker uses the critique\nof Locke as the springboard for their own moral position, one best\ndescribed as a brand of moral sense theory, in which conscience is the\nhuman capacity for empirically discerning the moral value of acts. In\nother words, one can, upon observing a given set of circumstances,\nknow with immediate certainty whether that act is morally good or\nevil.\n\nCockburn responds to the Remarks by showing that\nLocke\u2019s epistemology can satisfy these concerns. Cockburn\napproaches the question of Locke\u2019s epistemological foundations\nby emphasizing an aspect of Locke\u2019s theory of ideas of which\nLocke himself makes little use in his account of moral knowledge.\nHowever, it is a concept that he uses in his proof of God\u2019s\nexistence (the proof of which Cockburn reiterates in her\nDefence). Cockburn\u2019s moral theory employs Locke\u2019s\nconcept of reflection as a foundation not just for our knowledge of\nGod, but also as a means for human moral knowledge. She argues that it\nis by reflecting upon the operations of our own minds that we can\nreach an understanding of both human and divine nature. According to\nCockburn, morality is grounded in human nature, and the truth of moral\nlaws is guaranteed by the fact that humans are designed by God. This\nemphasis on human nature leads Cockburn quite naturally into a fitness\naccount of morality that predates Clarke\u2019s own view \u2013\nhuman nature entails that certain actions are fit and appropriate for\nhumans and certain are not. In later works, Cockburn explicitly adopts\nthe language of fitness relations to describe the necessary moral\norder arising from our created natures.\n\nIn the Defence, Cockburn also introduces the idea of\n\u2018conscience\u2019 as a way of accounting for human moral\nsentiment. According to Cockburn, conscience is a faculty, which she\ndescribes as a \u201csudden affection.\u201d This idea of conscience\nas a kind of natural moral affection complements Cockburn\u2019s view\nthat morality is founded upon human nature: Moral knowledge\narises from reflection upon our own natures and moral\naffection arises out of our natural constitutions. Cockburn\nuses this notion of conscience as a response to the Remarker\u2019s\naccount of morality. She argues that conscience is not an immediate\nsource of moral knowledge, but a source of moral affection or feeling\nthat complements, and presupposes, a proper (i.e., rational) knowledge\nof moral laws.\n\nIn later works, Cockburn adopts the term \u2018moral sense\u2019 to\ndescribe the affective faculty of conscience, a term which is not\nmeant to signal any affinity with Francis Hutcheson. She understood\nHutcheson to found morality exclusively on the moral sense while her\nown view sees moral sense as only one component within a largely\nrationalistic account of human moral understanding. It is not\nsurprising that Cockburn developed a proto-moral sense theory in the\nDefence and in later works. She sought early on to establish\na foundation for morality in human nature that sufficiently accounted\nfor the type of natural and seemingly immediate human moral\nsensibility that the Remarker believed was not accounted for by\nLocke.\n\nCockburn takes up the defense of Samuel Clarke\u2019s theory in later\nworks. Her first defense of Clarke was made in Remarks upon some\nWriters. Here we find the language of \u2018fitness\u2019\noccupying an even more prominent place than it had done in the\nDefence. This is only natural, given that the work is partly\ndevoted to a defense of Clarke\u2019s fitness theory, which had come\nto prominence in the intervening years. Throughout her discussion,\nCockburn maintains a commitment to the basic view that morality is\nfounded in the nature of humans and God. She sees this view as\ncohering with the general concept of fitness that she locates in\nClarke and his followers. In the Remarks upon some Writers,\nCockburn responds to critics of Clarkean moral fitness theory. These\ncritics attack Clarke from a shared basic view of morality as a system\nof laws expressing God\u2019s will. These laws are enforced by\nrewards and punishments that obligate by appealing to the fundamental\nhuman desire for happiness and freedom from pain. Rewards and\npunishments are thus seen as the fundamental means of harmonizing\nGod\u2019s will and human interest. Their main objection to fitness\ntheory is that fitness relations are not primitive moral constructs,\nbut actually presuppose more primitive constructs \u2013 i.e.,\nGod\u2019s will and human interest. Clarke\u2019s theory is accused\nof failing to provide sufficient account of these fundamental facts of\ndivine and human nature. Cockburn responds to this line of criticism\nby arguing that fitness theory in fact rests upon a more robust\nconception of the relationship between the will of God and human\ninterest than do the voluntarist accounts offered by Clarke\u2019s\ncritics.\n\nAccording to Cockburn, fitness theory assumes that both human nature\nand God\u2019s creative will are fundamental for morality. Fitness\ntheory rests upon the view that human interest is a basic expression\nof a human nature brought into being by divine will. Natural good and\nevil are thus fundamental concepts for moral fitness theory, for it is\nhuman nature and all that is associated with it that provides the\nbasis for moral law. For Cockburn, it is through knowledge of our own\nand God\u2019s natures that humans can understand the right and\nproper relations that ought to subsist in the universe. According to\nthis account, moral obligation arises from the demands of our natures\n\u2013 that is, we ought to be guided by that which is suitable and\nproper to our natures as rational and social beings. Common sense\njudges virtuous practice according to what is fit and natural, and not\nmerely according to the good the practice produces.\n\nIn Cockburn\u2019s third and last philosophical work, the Remarks\nupon the Principles and Reasonings of Dr. Rutherforth\u2019s\nEssay, she answers Dr. Thomas Rutherforth, a critic of Clarke\u2019s\nfitness theory. Rutherforth himself offers a brand of\nconsequentialism, defining as moral goodness that which brings about\ngood and prevents evil. Cockburn objects to this view, arguing that it\nignores the underlying fitness relations that serve to define what\nharms and benefits are significant or relevant for human beings in\nparticular circumstances. Even a hermit or someone stranded on a\ndeserted island may possess a sense of virtue, Cockburn argues, since\nvirtue is not founded on our prediction of the effects our actions\nwill have on other people. On Cockburn\u2019s view, humans have a\nnatural and innate tendency toward what is good and benevolent that\ntranscends merely weighing the effects of one\u2019s actions.\nCockburn identifies the moral sense as being a source of this\ndisinterested affection essential to moral decision-making. While\nreason retains its position of prominence in her morality, the moral\nsense plays an important role according to her in motivating agents to\nact morally. The obligation we feel to obey moral rules arises, for\nCockburn, not from reason alone, but from the perceptions of natural\nconscience, or moral sense. The moral sense, if governed by the\n\u201cnatural perceptions of the understanding,\u201d ought to\ninfluence our actions \u2013 it is a necessary component in creating\nmoral obligation.\n\nHere again, Cockburn sought to distance herself from Hutcheson\u2019s\nmoral sense theory. For Cockburn, moral sense was an important factor\nin accounting for moral judgments, but she insisted on its\nsubordination to reason as a guide in moral judgment. She holds this\nmoral sense account in concert with her fitness view. She presents her\nmoral sense theory within the context of a general moral fitness\ntheory, suggesting that Clarkean moral fitness theory could easily\naccommodate such an account. In this way, Cockburn sees herself as\noffering an account of moral motivation not entirely obvious in\nClarke\u2019s theory, but tempering the suggestion of blind instinct\nshe sees in Hutcheson\u2019s moral sense view. Cockburn\u2019s\nmorality sought to establish a foundation for morality in human nature\nthat sufficiently accounted for the type of natural and seemingly\nimmediate human moral sensibility that the Remarker believed was not\naccounted for by Locke and that Clarke\u2019s critics saw as lacking\nin his fitness view.\n",
