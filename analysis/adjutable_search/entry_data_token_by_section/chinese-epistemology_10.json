    "main_text": "Classical Approaches || Egalitarian Epistemology\n3.4 Egalitarian Epistemology\n\nAlthough the Neo-Mohists were never able to formulate an exhaustive\nresponse to Hui Shi\u2019s radical relativism, his contemporary\nZhuangzi (4th century BC) clearly found it to be an\nimportant stimulus for his own thought, and was definitely influenced\nby him when elaborating his own epistemological system. Zhuangzi\nbelieved that because knowledge was infinite, the human capacity for\ncomprehension was too limited to enable us to gain any true knowledge\n(Zhuangzi CTP: Yang sheng zhu, 1). Thus, he believed that\ncomprehension is always something relative (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu\nlun, 11). As a result, we are lost in a labyrinth of real and\nfalse recognitions. But this apparently tragic situation is mitigated\nby the fact that we do not have to face it alone, we are always\naccompanied by other people who are just as blind as we are. All of us\nare busy dealing with questions of mastering our reality and thus with\nquestions of the indefinite nature of our existence (Zhuangzi CTP:\nQiwu lun, 3). Since we are determined by the limitations of\nour senses, we naturally tend to acknowledge the truth of those kinds\nof recognitions that happen to match our own value systems (Zhuangzi\nCTP: Yu yan, 1). Ultimately, human subjectivity determines\nwhat should be regarded as (true and universally valid) knowledge. The\napparent objectivity and independence of the human mind has repeatedly\nbeen proven to be a false, illusory chimera, which only leads to\nself-deception. The quality, the features and the extent of our\nperception are always determined by the actual conditions of our\nexistence. Hence, our perception\u2014and the actions resulting from\nit\u2014are always dependent upon external factors, even though\nultimately, every form of dependence is actually a form of\nself-dependence. Of course, such dependence and determination\nare connected to our ignorance, to our incapacity to recognize our\nessence and the essence of our surroundings (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu\nlun, 13).\n\nZhuangzi believed that acknowledging the relative nature of all\nexistence was still not sufficient in order to define equivalents and\ndistinctions (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 10). In each concrete\ncase, the structure of our cognition enables us to identify at least\none common or different quality, which then allows us to make a\ndistinction, no matter how atypical it might be.\n\nThis position of radical relativism was common to both Hui Shi and\nZhuangzi. They also shared a skepticism concerning the idea that the\ncategorical mechanism of identity and difference (tong/yi)\ncould provide an adequate basis for a universal, permanently valid\n(chang) standardization of concepts or names\n(ming).\n\nFollowing the tradition of classical Daoism, Zhuangzi also believed in\nthe inherent inexpressibility of the holistic essence of all being.\nThis led him to espouse the classical Daoist method of comprehension,\ni.e., introspection (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 5). Although he\ndid not offer an instant solution to the eternal issues that form the\nheart of his philosophical discourse, he tried to create a new\napproach to the complex problem of human interactions. For him, the\ninternalization of language is a process inherent to human nature,\njust like eating, drinking and breathing, or anything else that\nconditions our survival (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 9).\n\nHowever, the uncertain connection between language and thought is not\na one-way street (Allinson 1989: 11) and, in fact, the communicative\npotential of language was trapped on the narrow footbridge between\nspeaker and hearer, between transmitter and receiver. Therefore,\nZhuangzi believed that language was inseparably connected to\ncomprehension; in essence, they share the same qualities (Zhaungzi\nCTP: Qiwu lun, 2). As a result, all linguistically determined\nboundaries within holistically structured reality are, in fact, false,\nsince language cannot express itself (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun,\n10).\n\nJust like dao in its original function of the fundamental,\nall-embracing essence of all beings, and just like our recognition of\nthis original path, language itself is also absolute in the sense of\nthe unity of all relative contradictions of which it is composed\n(Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu lun, 12).\n\nZhuangzi showed little interest in the problems that occupied the\nmajority of philosophers of his time, i.e., problems of connecting\ndifferent, individual minds into one comprehensible unity. He\nevidently believed that the problems of inter-subjectivity were not\nimposed upon us from outside; rather, he saw them as resulting from\nour being trapped in patterns of socially determined ambitions. We\ncould never master our destinies by forceful interventions into the\nintegrity of everything that exists, neither by artificial and false\ndistinctions nor by absolute valuations. The reason for this was that\nhuman existence was not subordinated to any external, higher powers\nthat could be controlled through comprehension (Zhuangzi CTP: Qiwu\nlun, 3).\n\nIn such an egalitarian epistemology, each type of understanding is\nequally possible. Zhuangzi\u2019s correlativity does not provide an\nabsolute perspective that could overrule the judgments or valuations\nof any method of comprehension.\n",
