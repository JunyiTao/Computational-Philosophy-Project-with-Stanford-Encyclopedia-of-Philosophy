    "main_text": "Preface Paradox\n4. Preface Paradox\n\nIn the preface of Introduction to the Foundations of\nMathematics, Raymond Wilder (1952, iv) apologizes for the errors\nin the text. The 1982 reprint has three pages of errata that vindicate\nWilder\u2019s humility. D. C. Makinson (1965, 205) quotes Wilder\u2019s\n1952 apology and extracts a paradox: Wilder rationally believes each\nof the assertions in his book. But since Wilder regards himself as\nfallible, he rationally believes the conjunction of all his assertions\nis false. If the agglomeration principle holds, \\((Bp \\amp Bq)\n\\rightarrow B(p \\amp q)\\), Wilder would rationally believe the\nconjunction of all assertions in his book and also rationally\ndisbelieve the same thing!\n\nThe preface paradox does not rely on a probabilistic acceptance rule.\nThe preface belief is organically generated in a qualitative fashion.\nThe author is merely reflecting on his humbling resemblance to other\nauthors who are fallible, his own past failing that he subsequently\ndiscovered, his imperfection in fact checking, and so on.\n\nAt this juncture many philosophers join Kyburg in rejecting\nagglomeration and conclude that it can be rational to have jointly\ninconsistent beliefs. Kyburg\u2019s solution to the preface paradox\nraises a methodological question about the nature of paradox. How can\nparadoxes change our minds if joint inconsistency is permitted? A\nparadox is commonly defined as a set of propositions that are\nindividually plausible but jointly inconsistent. The inconsistency is\nthe itch that directs us to scratch out a member of the set (or the\npain that leads us to withdraw from the stimulus). For instance, much\nepistemology orbits an ancient riddle posed by the regress of\njustification, namely, which of the following is false?\n\nA belief can only be justified by another justified belief.\nThere are no circular chains of justification.\nAll justificatory chains have a finite length.\nSome beliefs are justified.\n\n\nFoundationalists reject (1). They take some propositions to be\nself-evident or they permit beliefs to be justified by non-beliefs (such as perceptions or intuitions).\nCoherentists reject (2). They tolerate some forms of circular\nreasoning. For instance, Nelson Goodman (1965) has characterized the\nmethod of reflective equilibrium as virtuously circular.\nCharles Saunders Peirce (1933\u201335, 5.250) may have rejected (3).\nThe first clear rejector is Peter Klein (2007). For a book-length\ndefense, read Scott F. Aikin (2011). Infinitists believe that\ninfinitely long chains of justification are no more impossible than\ninfinitely long chains of causation. Finally, the epistemological\nanarchist rejects (4). As Paul Feyerabend refrains in Against\nMethod, \u201cAnything goes\u201d (1988, vii, 5, 14, 19,\n159).\n\nFormulating a paradox as a set of individually plausible but jointly\ninconsistent beliefs is a feat of data compression. But if joint\ninconsistency is rationally tolerable, why do these philosophers\nbother to offer solutions to paradoxes such as the regress of\njustification? Why is it irrational to believe each of (1)\u2013(4),\ndespite their joint inconsistency?\n\nKyburg might answer that there is a scale effect. Although the\nsensation of joint inconsistency is tolerable when diffusely\ndistributed over a large body of propositions, the sensation becomes\nan itch when the inconsistency localizes (Knight 2002). That is why\nparadoxes are always represented as a small set of\npropositions. A paradox is improved by reducing its membership \u2014\nas when a member of the set is exposed as superfluous to the\ninconsistency. (Strictly speaking, a set can only change size in the\nmetaphorical way that a number grows or shrinks.)\n\nIf you know that your beliefs are jointly inconsistent but deny this\nmakes for a giant paradox, then you should reject R. M.\nSainsbury\u2019s definition of a paradox as \u201can apparently\nunacceptable conclusion derived by apparently acceptable reasoning\nfrom apparently acceptable premises\u201d (1995, 1). Take the\nnegation of any of your beliefs as a conclusion and your remaining\nbeliefs as the premises. You should judge this jumble argument as\nvalid, and as having premises that you accept, and yet as having a\nconclusion you reject (Sorensen 2003b, 104\u2013110). If the\nconclusion of this argument counts as a paradox, then the negation of\nany of your beliefs counts as a paradox.\n\nThe resemblance between the preface paradox and the surprise test\nparadox becomes more visible through an intermediate case. The preface\nof Siddhartha Mukherjee\u2019s The Emperor of All Maladies: A\nBiography of Cancer warns: \u201cIn cases where there was no\nprior public knowledge, or when interviewees requested privacy, I have\nused a false name, and deliberately confounded identities to make it\ndifficult to track.\u201d (2010, xiv) Those who refuse consent to be\nlied to are free to close Doctor Mukherjee\u2019s chronicle. But\nnearly all readers think the physician\u2019s trade-off between lies\nand new information is acceptable. They rationally anticipate being\nrationally misled. Nevertheless, these readers learn much about the\nhistory of cancer. Similarly, students who are warned that they will\nreceive a surprise test rationally expect to be rationally misled\nabout the day of the test. The prospect of being misled does not lead\nthem to drop the course.\n\nThe preface paradox pressures Kyburg to extend his tolerance of joint\ninconsistency to the acceptance of contradictions. For\nMakinson\u2019s original specimen is a logician\u2019s regret at\naffirming contradictions rather than false contingent\nstatements. Consider a logic student who is required to pick one\nhundred truths from a mixed list of tautologies and contradictions\n(Sorensen 2001, 156\u2013158). Although the modest student believes\neach of his answers, \\(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_{100}\\), he also believes\nthat at least of one these answers is false. This ensures he believes\na contradiction. If any of his answers is false, then the student\nbelieves a contradiction (because the only falsehoods on the question\nlist are contradictions). If all of his test answers are true, then\nthe student believes the following contradiction: \\({\\sim}(A_1 \\amp\nA_2 \\amp \\ldots \\amp A_{100})\\). After all, a conjunction of\ntautologies is itself a tautology and the negation of any tautology is\na contradiction.\n\nIf paradoxes were always sets of propositions or arguments or\nconclusions, then they would always be meaningful. But some paradoxes\nare semantically flawed (Sorensen 2003b, 352) and some have answers\nthat are backed by a pseudo-argument employing a defective\n\u201clemma\u201d that lacks a truth-value. Kurt Grelling\u2019s\nparadox, for instance, opens with a distinction between autological\nand heterological words. An autological word describes itself, e.g.,\n\u2018polysyllabic\u2019 is polysllabic, \u2018English\u2019 is\nEnglish, \u2018noun\u2019 is a noun, etc. A heterological word does\nnot describe itself, e.g., \u2018monosyllabic\u2019 is not\nmonosyllabic, \u2018Chinese\u2019 is not Chinese, \u2018verb\u2019\nis not a verb, etc. Now for the riddle: Is \u2018heterological\u2019\nheterological or autological? If \u2018heterological\u2019 is\nheterological, then since it describes itself, it is autological. But\nif \u2018heterological\u2019 is autological, then since it is a word\nthat does not describe itself, it is heterological. The common\nsolution to this puzzle is that \u2018heterological\u2019, as\ndefined by Grelling, is not a well-defined predicate (Thomson 1962).\nIn other words, \u201cIs \u2018heterological\u2019\nheterological?\u201d is without meaning. There can be no predicate\nthat applies to all and only those predicates it does not apply to for\nthe same reason that there can be no barber who shaves all and only\nthose people who do not shave themselves.\n\nThe eliminativist, who thinks that \u2018know\u2019 or\n\u2018justified\u2019 is meaningless, will diagnose the epistemic\nparadoxes as questions that only appear to be well-formed.\nFor instance, the eliminativist about justification would not accept\nproposition (4) in the regress paradox: \u2018Some beliefs are\njustified\u2019. His point is not that no beliefs meet the high\nstandards for justification, as an anarchist might deny that any\nostensible authorities meet the high standards for legitimacy.\nInstead, the eliminativist unromantically diagnoses\n\u2018justified\u2019 as a pathological term. Just as the astronomer\nignores \u2018Are there a zillion stars?\u2019 on the grounds that\n\u2018zillion\u2019 is not a genuine numeral, the eliminativist\nignores \u2018Are some beliefs justified?\u2019 on the grounds that\n\u2018justified\u2019 is not a genuine adjective.\n\nIn the twentieth century, suspicions about conceptual pathology were\nstrongest for the liar paradox: Is \u2018This sentence is\nfalse\u2019 true? Philosophers who thought that there was something\ndeeply defective with the surprise test paradox assimilated it to the\nliar paradox. Let us review the assimilation process.\n",
