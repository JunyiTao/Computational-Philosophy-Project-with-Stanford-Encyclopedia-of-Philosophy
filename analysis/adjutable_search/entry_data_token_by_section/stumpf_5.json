Philosophy of Mathematics\n\nThe recent publication of Stumpf\u2019s habilitation thesis\n\u00dcber die Grunds\u00e4tze der Mathematik raises\nmany questions which have been the subject of recent commentaries. (D.\nM\u00fcnch, 2002\u20132003; W. Ewen, 2008; C. Ierna, 2015).\nStumpf\u2019s habilitation thesis focuses on the nature and origins\nof mathematical principles or axioms. Its starting point rests on the\nfollowing question:\n\nIs there knowledge of scientific importance, which is in no way based\nimmediately nor mediately on experience; and if there is such\nknowledge, what is its source? (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 1\u20131)\n\n\nThe habilitation thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part,\nStumpf examines two antagonistic positions which prevailed at the\ntime, namely J. S. Mill\u2019s empiricism according to which there is\nno knowledge that is not mediately acquired by induction, and Kantian\ntranscendentalism which claims that our knowledge of the general\nprinciples of mathematics is based on synthetic a priori\njudgments. Stumpf rejects both accounts and seeks to show, in the\nsecond part of his thesis, that axioms and mathematical propositions\nare analytic a priori; they are not acquired through\nexperience but are the result of a process of deduction from\nconcepts.\n\nIn the critical part of his work, Stumpf raises the problem of the\norigins of the laws and principles of logic and mathematics as\nfollows: if these principles are inductive in nature, as Mill believes\nthem to be, then they do not constitute necessary truths; if, on the\ncontrary, they are necessary truths, then the question arises as to\nwhether they are synthetic a priori judgments as Kant claims\nor analytic a priori propositions as Stumpf claims. Against\nMill, Stumpf argues that the axioms are not the result of empirical\ngeneralization based on an inductive process, and that arithmetic,\nlike geometry, is a deductive science based on a priori and\nnecessary truths, which are justified by the evidence of internal\nperception. (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 5\u20134) Stumpf therefore agrees\nwith Kant that axioms are necessary truths, but he denies that they\nare based on synthetic a priori judgments. Stumpf argues\nrather that Kant\u2019s synthetic judgments presuppose a kind of\n\u201cmental machinery\u201d (Stumpf, 2008, Bogen 16\u20133) in\norder to account for their formation, as they involve numerous\nassumptions, notably the a priori forms of sensibility,\nintuition, and Denkformen, which Stumpf takes to be mere\nconstructions. Stumpf criticizes Kant especially for the thesis\naccording to which the origins of the necessity of our knowledge of\naxioms lie in intuition, in that knowledge of mathematics then becomes\ndependent upon experience. However, Stumpf argues that intuition\nunderstood in the Kantian sense is inductive and only leads to\nconcepts and never to propositions. That is why Stumpf claims that the\nvery idea of synthetic a priori judgments is a contradiction\nin terms. Axioms and propositions are analytic judgments constructed\ndeductively from concepts. We can see that Stumpf\u2019s fundamental\nargument against empiricism and transcendental criticism rests on the\nfundamental distinction between concept and proposition, which are of\nmajor philosophical significance in Stumpf\u2019s subsequent work on\nthe theory of knowledge, as we will later see. In his habilitation\nthesis, Stumpf is more concerned with delimiting the field of logic\nand mathematics from that of psychology. In this regard, Stumpf\nclearly separates the question of the origins of concepts, which is a\npsychological question, from the logico-mathematical domain to which\npropositions and axioms belong. For, as Stumpf argues in his\nposthumous work, one can agree with empiricism on the psychological\norigin of concepts while acknowledging that there is a priori\nknowledge which is independent from experience. (Stumpf,\n1939\u20131940, p. 126) For Stumpf admits that the basic concepts of\narithmetic (the concept of number) and geometry (the concept of space)\nhave their origins in experience. In his Raumbuch, published\nthree years after his habilitation thesis, Stumpf attempts to\ndemonstrate the thesis that the concept of space has psychological\norigins. However, the position one takes on this issue is distinct\nfrom that which one adopts regarding the nature of propositions and\nnecessary truths in the logico-mathematical domain. For, in this\ndomain, one is solely concerned with axioms and propositions, which\ncan be deductively inferred, and one also assumes the origins of the\naxioms and their justification as necessary truths. Stumpf argued in\n1870 that these axioms are analytic a priori propositions and\nthat arithmetic and geometry are deductive sciences.\n\nThere is a remarkable continuity in the work of Stumpf regarding his\npositions from his habilitation thesis up to his posthumous work, not\nonly on the foundation of mathematics but also on the theory of\nknowledge. One of the main theses he advocates in\nErkenntnislehre is based on the distinction between the\norigins of concepts and the origins of knowledge. (Stumpf,\n1939\u20131940, \u00a7 1) Stumpf revisits the theme of mathematical\naxioms (Stumpf, 1939\u20131940, \u00a7\u00a7 12\u201313) in the\ncontext of a critical discussion of Husserl\u2019s doctrine of formal\nand regional ontologies. Stumpf\u2019s conception of the concept of\nnumber in Erkenntnislehre is the same as the one he advocated\nin his habilitation thesis and in his Halle lectures, and\nStumpf\u2019s position is very similar to that of Brentano and his\nstudents. (W. Ewen, 2008, p 162 f.; C. Ierna, 2015) In this regard,\nStumpf\u2019s influence on his student Husserl\u2019s habilitation\nthesis regarding the origins of the concept of number, including\nHusserl\u2019s conception of symbolic presentations, is to be\nconsidered. (D. M\u00fcnch, 2002, pp. 31\u201337)\n\nNow, what is the place of mathematics in Stumpf\u2019s classification\nof sciences? This question was left open in our earlier remarks\nbecause the classification criteria we used were based on the cardinal\ndistinction between phenomena and psychical functions, which underlies\nthe main division between natural and social sciences. But as Stumpf\npointed out in his paper \u201cOn the Classification of\nSciences\u201d, contrary to the method with which most\nclassifications that are meant to be normative proceed, a\nclassification that describes the state of a science as it is\npracticed at a given time in the history cannot rely on a single\ncriterion of classification, and its task is to show how several\ncriteria are intertwined in many ways (C. Stumpf, 1906a, p. 88). This\nis why one must rely on a new criterion based on the distinction\nbetween a priori and a posteriori methods in order\nto delineate mathematics, including geometry, from the other sciences.\nIndeed:\n\nThe most tangible characteristic that is offered to us to delineate\nthe mathematical sciences from all other sciences is that of the\ndifferences in method, i.e. the a priori method as opposed to\nthe a posteriori method. Despite the opposing effort to\nassimilate mathematics to the natural sciences, this distinction\npersists, and in my opinion, rightly so. The attempt made by J. St.\nMill to inductively derive the principles of mathematics (and logic)\nfrom a collection of several individual experiences manifestly runs in\ncircles. (C. Stumpf, 1906a, p. 65)\n\n\nThis applies a fortiori to geometry which Stumpf, unlike\nKant, refuses to ground on the concept of intuition insofar as it is\nan analytic a priori science, like any other branches of\nmathematics. The position he advocates in 1906 is therefore not\ndifferent from the one he advocated thirty-five years earlier in his\nhabilitation thesis. (Ewen, 2008, p. 157ff.) As an a priori\nscience, one could say that mathematics is actually presupposed by all\nother sciences as Stumpf suggests in referring positively to Auguste\nComte\u2019s hierarchy of the positive sciences. (C. Stumpf, 1906a,\np. 88) For, according to Comte, the hierarchy between sciences within\nhis classification presupposes that all sciences, from physics to\nphysiology, logically depend on mathematics, that is, the most simple\nscience, and is the most autonomous with regard to all other sciences.\nIn this regard, Stumpf here adopts a position akin to that of Brentano\nwho followed Comte\u2019s criteria on the matter of the\nclassification of sciences, with the important difference being that\npsychology replaces sociology within Brentano\u2019s system of\nsciences and that the field of psychical functions is, according to\nStumpf, independent from all other sciences.
