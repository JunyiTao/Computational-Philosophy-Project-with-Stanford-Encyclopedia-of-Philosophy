    "main_text": "Basic Orientations in Environmental Aesthetics || Cognitive Views\n3.1 Cognitive Views\n\nWhat are called cognitive, conceptual, or narrative positions in\nenvironmental aesthetics are united by the thought that knowledge and\ninformation about the nature of the object of appreciation is central\nto its aesthetic appreciation. Thus, they champion the idea that\nnature must be appreciated, as one author puts it, \u201con its own\nterms\u201d (Saito 1998b). These positions tend to reject aesthetic\napproaches to environments, such as that governed by the idea of the\npicturesque, that draw heavily on the aesthetic experience of art for\nmodeling the appreciation of nature. Yet they affirm that art\nappreciation can nonetheless show some of what is required in an\nadequate account of nature appreciation. For example, in serious,\nappropriate aesthetic appreciation of works of art, it is taken to be\nessential that we experience works as what they in fact are and in\nlight of knowledge of their real natures. Thus, for instance,\nappropriate appreciation of a work such as Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica (1937) requires that we experience it as a painting\nand moreover as a cubist painting, and therefore that we appreciate it\nin light of our knowledge of paintings in general and of cubist\npaintings in particular (Walton 1970). Adopting this general line of\nthought, one cognitive approach to nature appreciation, sometimes\nlabeled the natural environmental model (Carlson 1979) or scientific\ncognitivism (Parsons 2002), holds that just as serious, appropriate\naesthetic appreciation of art requires knowledge of art history and\nart criticism, such aesthetic appreciation of nature requires\nknowledge of natural history\u2014the knowledge provided by the\nnatural sciences and especially sciences such as geology, biology, and\necology. The idea is that scientific knowledge about nature can reveal\nthe actual aesthetic qualities of natural objects and environments in\nthe way in which knowledge about art history and art criticism can for\nworks of art. In short, to appropriately aesthetically appreciate\nnature \u201con its own terms\u201d is to appreciate it as it is\ncharacterized by natural science (Carlson 1981 2000 2007, Rolston\n1995, Eaton 1998, Matthews 2002, Parsons 2002 2006b).\n\nOther cognitive or quasi-cognitive accounts of the aesthetic\nappreciation of environments differ from scientific cognitivism\nconcerning either the kind of cognitive resources taken to be relevant\nto such appreciation or the degree to which these resources are\nconsidered relevant. On the one hand, several cognitive approaches\nemphasize different kinds of information, claiming that appreciating\nnature \u201con its own terms\u201d might well involve experiencing\nit in light of various cultural and historical traditions. Thus, in\nappropriate aesthetic appreciation, local and regional narratives,\nfolklore, and even mythological stories about nature are endorsed\neither as complementary with or as alternative to scientific knowledge\n(Sep\u00e4nmaa 1993, Saito 1998b, Heyd 2001). On the other hand,\nanother at least quasi-cognitive approach strongly supports the idea\nthat nature must be appreciated \u201cas nature\u201d, but does not\ngo beyond that constraint. The justification for accepting the\n\u201cas nature\u201d restriction is that the aesthetic experience\nof nature should be true to what nature actually is. This, however, is\nthe extent of the approach\u2019s commitment to cognitivism and marks\nthe limits of the similarity that it finds between art appreciation\nand the appreciation of nature. It rejects the idea that scientific\nknowledge about nature can reveal the actual aesthetic qualities of\nnatural objects and environments in the way in which knowledge about\nart history and art criticism can for works of art. Moreover, it holds\nthat, unlike the case with art, many of the most significant aesthetic\ndimensions of natural objects and environments are extremely relative\nto conditions of observation. The upshot is that aesthetic\nappreciation of nature is taken to allow a degree of freedom that is\ndenied to the aesthetic appreciation of art (Fisher 1998, Budd\n2002).\n",
