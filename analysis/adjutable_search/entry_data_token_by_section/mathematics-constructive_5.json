    "main_text": "Varieties of Constructive Mathematics || Bishop\u2019s Constructive Mathematics\n3.3 Bishop\u2019s Constructive Mathematics\n\nProgress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively\nslow throughout the next decade and a half. What was needed to raise\nthe profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top-ranking\nclassical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive\ndevelopment of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to\nBrouwer\u2019s non-classical principles or to the machinery of\nrecursive function theory. This need was fulfilled in 1967, with the\nappearance of Errett Bishop\u2019s monograph Foundations of\nConstructive Analysis [1967] (see also Bishop & Bridges\n[1985]), the product of an astonishing couple of years in which,\nworking in the informal but rigorous style used by normal analysts,\nBishop provided a constructive development of a large part of\ntwentieth-century analysis, including the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem,\nthe Hahn-Banach and separation theorems, the spectral theorem for\nself-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, the Lebesgue convergence\ntheorems for abstract integrals, Haar measure and the abstract Fourier\ntransform, ergodic theorems, and the elements of Banach algebra\ntheory. Thus, at a stroke, he gave the lie to the commonly-held view\nexpressed so forcefully by Hilbert: \n\nTaking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would\nbe the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to\nthe boxer the use of his fists. (Hilbert [1928])\n\n\nNot only did Bishop\u2019s mathematics, BISH, have the\nadvantage of readability \u2014 if you open Bishop\u2019s book at\nany page, what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if,\nfrom time to time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear\nstrange to one schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle\n\u2014 but, unlike intuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits\nmany different interpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive\nconstructive mathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide\nmodels of BISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be\ninterpreted, with at most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of\ncomputable mathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch\u2019s Type\nTwo Effectivity Theory (Weihrauch [2000]; Bauer [2005]). \n\nHow is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by\nBishop\u2019s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of\n\u201calgorithm\u201d or, in his words, \u201cfinite\nroutine\u201d. This refusal has led to the criticism that his\napproach lacks the precision that a logician would normally expect of\na foundational system. However, this criticism can be overcome by\nlooking more closely at what practitioners of BISH actually do when\nthey prove theorems: in practice, they are doing mathematics with\nintuitionistic logic. Experience shows that the restriction to\nintuitionistic logic always forces mathematicians to work in a manner\nthat, at least informally, can be described as algorithmic; so\nalgorithmic mathematics appears to be equivalent to mathematics\nthat uses only intuitionistic logic. If that is the case, then we\ncan practice constructive mathematics using intuitionistic logic on\nany reasonably defined mathematical objects, not just some class of\n\u201cconstructive objects\u201d.\n\nThis view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by\nRichman [1990, 1996]. Taking the logic as the primary characteristic\nof constructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of\nmathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer,\nHeyting, Markov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the\nother hand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in\npractice.\n\nThus one might distinguish between the ontological\nconstructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive\nmathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental\ncreations, and the epistemological constructivism of Richman\nand those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its\nmethodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the\nformer approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and\nthe latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian\nontology.\n\nTo do actual mathematics we need more than just intutionistic logic.\nFor Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics were the positive\nintegers (see the quote from Bishop [1967] in Section 3.1 above).\nAmong the early formal systems for BISH were Myhill\u2019s\n[1975] axiomatic foundation based on primitive notions of number, set,\nand function; Feferman\u2019s [1975] system for explicit\nmathematics; and Friedman\u2019s [1977] intuitionistic ZF set\ntheory. The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at\nthis stage are\n constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (CZF),\n in Aczel and Rathjen [2010, in Other Internet Resources], and\n intuitionistic type theory,\n in Martin-L\u00f6f [1975, 1984].\n",
