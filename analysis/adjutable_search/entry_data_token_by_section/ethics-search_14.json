    "main_text": "Moral Accountability and Social-Responsibility Issues for Search Engine Companies || Some Questions Affecting Trust\n5. Conclusion\n\n\nIn this entry, we have seen how various ethical issues arose during\nkey developmental stages of search technology that eventually led to\ncontemporary \u201cWeb 2.0-era search engines.\u201d Search\ntechnology itself has evolved over the past 75 years\u2014i.e., from\npre-computer-based techniques (such as memex) intended to help\nscientists and professional researchers locate and retrieve important\ninformation in a timely manner, to an Internet-based technology that\nassisted ordinary users in locating (and linking directly to) relevant\nWeb sites in response to their manifold search queries, to a highly\nsophisticated technology that, in its current form, has become\nincreasingly commodified and personalized to the point that it might\nnow be regarded as a threat to some of our basic freedoms and\ndemocratic ideals.\n\n\nThe ethical issues examined in this entry are\nmainly from a deontological perspective, thus reflecting the published\nwork on this topic to date. However, in no way is our analysis of\nethical issues affecting search engines intended to be exhaustive;\nrather it merely reflects the standard or \u201cmainstream\u201d\napproach that applied ethicists and other scholars have taken thus far\nin their analyses of search engine controversies. One could easily\nimagine questions arising from other ethical perspectives as\nwell. From the vantage point of social justice, for example, one could\nreasonably ask whether search engine companies in the U.S. and other\ndeveloped nations are morally obligated to help bridge the\n\u201cinformation divide\u201d by providing easier and more\nubiquitous access (via search technologies) to users in developing\nnations, especially to non-English speaking users. Also, from a\nutilitarian or consequentialist perspective, one might ask whether the\noverall social consequences would be more beneficial if search engine\nusers were legally permitted to retrieve some forms of proprietary\ninformation (e.g. proprietary online information concerning health and\npublic-health studies that were made possible by tax-payer funding)\nfor personal use.\n\nAdditionally, some alternative ethical frameworks could also be used\nin analyzing ethical issues affecting search engines. These include,\nbut are not limited to, Hans Jonas\u2019 \u201cImperative of\nResponsibility\u201d (Jonas 1984), Bernard Gert\u2019s \u201cCommon\nMorality\u201d (Gert 2007), and John Rawls\u2019 \u201cjustice as\nfairness\u201d (Rawls 1999). For a very brief description of how\nethical aspects of search engines might also be approached from the\nperspectives of \u201crights,\u201d \u201cfairness,\u201d\n\u201ccommon good\u201d and \u201cvirtue,\u201d see the Markkula\nCenter for Applied Ethics (in the Other Internet Resources).\n\n\nEven though the primary focus has been on identifying and analyzing\nethical issues affecting search engines, in closing it is\nworth reiterating a point made in the introductory section\u2014viz.,\nthat search engine technology also has implications for some\nother kinds of philosophical issues. This is especially apparent in the\narea of epistemology, where some critics raise concerns related to our\nreceived notions of the nature and justification of knowledge claims,\nin an era of widespread use and dependence on search engines. For\nexample, Hinman (2008, 75) argues that search engines\n\u201ccontribute significantly to the social construction of\nknowledge\u201d\u2014i.e., not only do they provide access to\nknowledge, but they also increasingly \u201cplay a crucial role in\nthe constitution of knowledge itself.\u201d An analysis of this claim, however, as well as\nother epistemological and (broader) philosophical aspects of search engines, is beyond\nthe scope of the present entry.\n",
