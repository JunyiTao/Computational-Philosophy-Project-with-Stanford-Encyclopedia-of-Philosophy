Formulating Animalism\n\nDespite its Aristotelian heritage, animalism is a relative newcomer to\nthe personal identity debate. While early intimations of the view can\nbe found in work by Wiggins (1980) and Wollheim (1984), those\nprimarily responsible for injecting the view into the contemporary\ndebate over personal identity include Ayers (1991), Carter (1989,\n1999), Olson (1997), Snowdon (1990, 1991, 1995), and van Inwagen\n(1990). Though its supporters appear to remain in the minority,\nanimalism has since attracted other advocates, including Bailey (2016,\n2017), Blatti (2012), DeGrazia (2005), Hacker (2007), Hershenov\n(2005a), D. Mackie (1999a,b), Merricks (2001), and Wiggins (2001).\nNotable critics include Baker (2000, 2016), Johnston (2007, 2016),\nMcMahan (2002), Noonan (1998, 1989 [2019]), Parfit (2012), and S.\nShoemaker (1999, 2011, 2016), among others.\n\nThe name \u2018animalism\u2019 was conferred by Snowdon (1991: 109)\nand has been widely adopted. The view is also sometimes referred to as\n\u201cthe organism view\u201d (e.g., Liao 2006), the\n\u201cbiological criterion\u201d (e.g., D. Shoemaker 2009), or\n\u201cthe biological approach\u201d (e.g., Olson 1997).\n1.1 Our Fundamental Nature\n\nAnimalism\u2019s hallmark claim concerns our basic metaphysical\nnature: whether we are material or immaterial; simple or composite;\nsubstance, property, process, or event; organic or inorganic; etc. In\nthis context, the animalist asserts simply:\n\n(1\u2032)\nWe are animals.\n\n\nDespite its plainness, (1\u2032) is easily misinterpreted (for\ndiscussion, see D. Mackie 1999b: 230\u201333; Olson 2003:\n318\u201321; and Snowdon 2014: ch. 1). According to the intended\nreading, the \u2018we\u2019 picks out human persons such as you and\nme. Nevertheless, (1\u2032) should not be taken to assert that\nall persons are animals. It leaves open the possibilities of\nboth non-animal people (e.g., robots, angels, aliens, deities) and\nhuman animals that are not people (e.g., patients in persistent\nvegetative states, human fetuses). The \u2018are\u2019 reflects the\n\u2018is\u2019 of numerical identity. Consequently, animalism is not\nthe view that each of us is \u201cconstituted by\u201d a particular\norganism, in the way that a statue is sometimes said to be\nnon-identically constituted by the hunk of matter with which it\ncoincides (see\n section 2.3).\n Nor still should (1\u2032) be understood to claim that each of us\nhas a body that is an animal\u2014as if you were one thing\nand your animal body another. Finally, \u2018animals\u2019 refers to\nbiological organisms\u2014members of the primate species Homo\nsapiens. While participants on both sides of the debate over\nanimalism tend to treat these terms interchangeably, some prominent\ncritics distinguish \u2018animals\u2019 from \u2018organisms\u2019\nand deny that these terms co-refer (e.g., Johnston 2007: 55\u201356,\nS. Shoemaker 2011: 353).\n\nExpressed in logical notation and individualized, (1\u2032) is\nsometimes presented in the following form:\n\n(1\u2033)\n\\(\\Box (\\forall x) (x \\text{ is a human person} \\rightarrow \n\t\tx \\text{ is an animal})\\).\n\n\nThis says: necessarily, for any object x, if x is a\nhuman person, then x is an animal, i.e., necessarily, human\npersons are animals. While neither (1\u2032) nor (1\u2033) is\nunproblematic (see, e.g., Johansson 2007 and Toner 2011), it is clear\nenough what they do not suggest. According to the animalism\naccount of our most fundamental nature, we are not\n\n immaterial souls or egos (Descartes; Foster 1991);\n material bodies (Thomson 1997; Williams 1957);\n body-soul complexes (Swinburne 1984);\n bundles of mental states (Hume; Rovane 1998; S. Campbell\n2006);\n material simples (Chisholm 1978 [1989]; Lowe 1996, 2001);\n parts of brains (Puccetti 1973; McMahan 2002);\n persons materially constituted by, but nonidentical with, animals\n(S. Shoemaker 1999; Baker 2000; Johnston 2007); or\n nothing at all (Unger 1979a,b; cf. Unger 1990).\n\n\nHaving said that, this entry will focus primarily on animalism\u2019s\npositive assertions, rather than on animalist criticisms of each of\nits rival views. The interested reader is directed to Olson 2007 and\nSnowdon 2014, which not only include qualified defenses of (1), but\nalso raise a host of criticisms of the foregoing\nalternatives\u2014criticisms that, if not motivated by an acceptance\nof (1), are at least consistent with its truth.\n\nIt bears mention that animalism is sometimes formulated slightly\ndifferently as:\n\n(1\u2034)\nWe are essentially animals.\n\n\nOn this construal, animalism is the view that we could not exist\nexcept as animals. Indeed, some have alleged that a commitment to\n(1\u2032) is insufficient to qualify anyone as an animalist and that\nthis label should be reserved only for those committed to\nboth (1\u2032) and (1\u2034) (Belshaw 2011: 401; cf. Olson\n2007: 26\u201327, Snowdon 1990). Insistence on this point is probably\ninnocuous, however, since most philosophers accept that all animals\n(human and otherwise) are essentially animals, in which case,\n(1\u2034) follows immediately from (1\u2032).\n\n(1)\nUnless otherwise noted, in what follows, \u2018(1)\u2019 will \n\tbe treated as referring equivocally to (1\u2032), (1\u2033), and \n\t(on the assumption that all animals are essentially animals) \n\t(1\u2034).\n\n1.2 Our Persistence\n\nWhile it is a claim about our fundamental nature that is most readily\nassociated with the name, animalism also incorporates a view about our\npersistence. Stated in its most general form, this view asserts the\nfollowing:\n\n(2)\nThe conditions\nwhose satisfaction is necessary and sufficient for a past or future\nbeing to be identical with a human person that exists now just are\nthose whose satisfaction is necessary and sufficient for a past or\nfuture being to be identical with an animal that exists\nnow.\n\n\nAll animalists subscribe to (2), so far as it goes. But it does not go\nvery far. What exactly are the conditions of (human) animal\ncontinuity? Although animalists are mostly in agreement, there is a\nsubtle and seldom acknowledged rift between two camps of animalist\nthinking about the answer to this question.\n\nAccording to the first camp, remaining alive is both a necessary and a\nsufficient condition for the persistence of human animals.\nHuman-animal persistence thus consists in the continuation of those\nprocesses constitutive of biological life. As Olson puts it,\n\u201cone survives just in case one\u2019s purely animal\nfunctions\u2014metabolism, the capacity to breathe and circulate\none\u2019s blood, and the like\u2014continue\u201d (1997: 16). On\nthis view, an animal\u2019s life is understood as\n\n\na self-organizing biological event that maintains the organism\u2019s\ncomplex internal structure. The materials that organisms are made up\nof are intrinsically unstable and must therefore be constantly\nrepaired and renewed, or else the organism dies and its remains decay.\nAn organism must constantly take in new particles, reconfigure and\nassimilate them into its living fabric, and expel those that are no\nlonger useful to it. An organism\u2019s life enables it to persist\nand retain its characteristic structure despite constant material\nturnover. (Olson 2007: 28)\n\n\nThis first animalist answer to the persistence question, then, can be\nglossed as follows:\n\n(2a)\n Given a human\nanimal, x, existing at one time, \\(t_1\\), and something,\ny, existing at a later time, \\(t_2\\), y is identical\nwith x if and only if y continues the life processes\npreviously undergone by x.\n\n\nOnce (2a) is conjoined with the animalist answer to the fundamental\nnature question, (1), we have a view that might be labeled\n\u201corganic animalism\u201d. Notable advocates of this view\ninclude Olson and van Inwagen (1990). Of course, it follows from the\norganicist view that death will constitute the end of our existence.\nWhatever else may remain following our deaths, each of us will cease\nto exist when we die. Indeed, strictly speaking on this view, there is\nno such thing as a dead animal (or perhaps\u2014if \u2018dead\u2019\nis a non-attributive adjective like \u2018fake\u2019\u2014that a\n\u201cdead animal\u201d is not an animal).\n\nThose in the second animalist camp deny that being alive is a\nnecessary condition for the persistence of human animals. On their\nview, a human animal (like all organisms) is a functionally organized\nphysical object whose membership in a particular species is attributed\nto its origin and structure. Only if it is so gruesome as to destroy\nthis structure will an organism\u2019s death bring about its\nnonexistence. We persist, David Mackie puts it, \u201cas long as this\norganisation of [our] constituent parts remains sufficiently nearly\nintact\u201d (1999b: 237).\n\nBut this focus on the functional organization of animal bodies should\nbe taken neither as discounting altogether the significance of the\nlife processes emphasized by organicists nor as affirming a\ntraditional bodily criterion of persistence. On the contrary, on this\nview, a human animal\u2019s \n\n\nlife is both a consequence or inseparable function of its origin and\nthe continuing explanation of its structure and parts at any moment of\nits existence. Life is essential to the thing in so far as it is\ninconceivable that it (this thing) should have come into existence as\na non-living thing. (Ayers 1991: vol. 2: 224)\n\n\n\u201cBut\u201d, Ayers continues, \u201cthat is not to say that\nwhen it dies the thing itself will cease to exist: merely that an\nexplanation of the existence and structure of the thing will then\nrefer to a life that is over\u201d (ibid.).\n\nIn contrast with their organicist counterparts, these animalists\nanswer the persistence question along the following lines:\n\n\nthe persistence of biological organisms depends on their retaining\n(enough of) the organisation of parts that is the product of their\nnatural biological development, and that makes them apt for life,\nwhile stopping short of saying that life itself is necessary. (D.\nMackie 1999b: 236) \n\n\nIn short:\n\n(2b)\nGiven a human\nanimal, x, existing at one time, \\(t_1\\), and something,\ny, existing at a later time, \\(t_2\\), y is identical\nwith x if and only if y retains a sufficient degree of\nthe life-apt structure of constituent parts previously exhibited by\nx.\n\n\nHereafter, \u2018somatic animalism\u2019 will refer to the\nconjunction of (1) and (2b). In addition to Ayers and Mackie, notable\nsomaticists include Carter (1989, 1999) and Feldman (1992).\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the debate between somatic and organic\nanimalists is not merely verbal and that the sort of linguistic\nevidence sometimes marshaled (e.g., by D. Mackie 1999b) is\u2014while\ngermane\u2014unlikely to settle the question at issue. The debate\nbetween somaticist and organicist conceptions of the conditions of\nanimal continuity reflects a substantive (if, as yet, inadequately\nexplored) disagreement about the nature of (human) animals. (Are they\nessentially living? How ought life itself be understood?) Moreover,\nwhile the issue of whether something can be both an animal and dead\nillustrates the somaticist-organicist debate, it is hardly\nthe only context in which that debate manifests itself. The same\ndebate could be illustrated when considering unborn human fetuses,\nhuman animals in suspended animation, etc.\n2. The Lockean Legacy\n\nToward the end of his magisterial two-volume commentary on John Locke,\nAyers writes that \n\n\nfor all the transformation of our motives, indeed, of our general\nphilosophical theory \u2026 the debate on personal identity has\nhardly moved on since the innovations of the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. (1991: vol. 2: 281)\n\n\nIn a similar spirit, S. Shoemaker recently adapted Whitehead\u2019s\nfamous remark, observing that \u201cthe history of the topic of\npersonal identity has been a series of footnotes to Locke\u201d\n(2008: 313). It is certainly undeniable that no single discussion of\npersonal identity has done more to shape the current debate than the\nchapter titled \u201cOf Identity and Diversity\u201d that Locke\nadded to the second edition of his Essay Concerning Human\nUnderstanding (II.xxvii). (Hereafter, all textual references to \nLocke are to this work, Locke 1689 [1975].) Also undeniable is the \neffect these\npages have had on the emergence of the animalist alternative to the\nLockean approach to personal identity. For whatever intuitive appeal\nanimalism may seem to have in our secular, post-Darwinian climate, in\nthe wake of Locke\u2019s work, the falsity of animalism was long\ntaken for granted.\n2.1 Locke\u2019s Human/Person Distinction\n\nFrom an animalist perspective, the most significant aspect of\nLocke\u2019s famous discussion is the sharp distinction he draws\nbetween the human animal (\u201cman\u201d) and the person. Unlike a\nmass of matter\u2014which consists merely in \u201cthe Cohesion of\nParticles \u2026 any how united\u201d (II.xxvii.4)\u2014a living\norganism (e.g., oak tree, horse, human animal) is a structurally\ncomplex material object whose functional organization is conducive to\ncontinued life. A person, by contrast, is a \n\u201cthinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and \ncan\nconsider it self as it self, the same thinking thing in different\ntimes and places; which it does by that consciousness, which is\ninseparable from thinking\u201d (II.xxvii.9).\n\nBy classifying \u201cman\u201d with other organisms and then drawing\na distinction between organisms and persons, Locke recognizes that he\nis prying apart the traditional notion of \u201cman\u201d as\nrational, on the one hand, and animal, on the other. Against this\ntraditional understanding, he introduces a thought experiment\ninvolving a rational parrot (II.xxvii.8). Our unwillingness to call\nthis parrot a \u201cman\u201d simply because it is an animal\npossessed of language and reason illustrates that not all rational\nanimals are men. Nor are all men rational animals: \u201cwhoever\nshould see a Creature of his own Shape and Make, though it had no more\nreason all its Life, than a Cat or a Parrot, would\ncall him still a Man\u201d (ibid.).  The human/person\ndistinction gains traction once it is coupled with one of\nthe Essay\u2019s key insights, viz. that sortal concepts\n(e.g., human animal, person) are often (though not\nalways) associated with different identity criteria.\n\u201cIdentity\u201d\u2014as he puts it in the title of the section\nin which this insight is first registered\u2014is \u201csuited to\nthe Idea\u201d: \u201csuch as is the Idea\nbelonging to [a] Name, such must be the Identity\u201d\n(II.xxvii.7). Locke is keenly aware of the significance of this\nprinciple; \u201cif it had been a little more carefully attended\nto\u201d, he admonishes, it \u201cwould possibly have prevented a\ngreat deal of that Confusion, which often occurs about this Matter\n\u2026 especially concerning\nPersonal Identity\u201d (ibid.).  And indeed, it is this\ninsight about the association of sortal concepts and identity criteria\nthat encourages the thought in Locke that human animals and persons\nare governed by different criteria of identity. Whereas a human animal\npersists just in case \u201cthe same continued Life [is] communicated\nto different Particles of Matter, as they happen successively to be\nunited to that organiz\u2019d living Body\u201d (II.xxvii.8), when\none \u201cconsider[s] what Person stands for\u201d, Locke\ncontends, one finds that its persistence consists in \u201cthe\nsameness of a rational Being\u201d. He explains: \u201cas far as\nthis consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or\nThought, so far reaches the Identity of that\nPerson\u201d (II.xxvii.9).\n\nThe impetus behind Locke\u2019s human/person distinction was the\nongoing debate amongst seventeenth- and eighteenth-century theologians\nand philosophers concerning the metaphysics of resurrection. Their\nchallenge was to account for the Biblical prediction that the dead\nwould be resurrected on judgment day. But what is it exactly that gets\nresurrected? The physical particles associated with a living organism\nare in a state of constant flux. The set of particles associated with\nan organism changes from one moment to the next and may turnover\ncompletely (perhaps several times) during the course of an\norganism\u2019s life. Moreover, whether due to decomposition and/or\nbecause they are consumed by other organisms, the particles associated\nwith an organism at its death will be widely dispersed. These facts\nalone make it unlikely, if not impossible, that the resurrection of\neach individual will involve the reconstitution of that\nindividual\u2019s former \u201cbody\u201d. The human/person\ndistinction supplies Locke with the resources to resolve this problem\nbecause, on his view, something is a person not because of\nthe material or immaterial substance in which it is grounded\u2014a\nquestion on which Locke remains steadfastly agnostic, though he is\ninclined to think the underlying substance is immaterial\n(II.xxvii.25)\u2014but in virtue of the psychological capacities it\nexercises, viz. self-consciousness and rationality. And a person\npersists \u201cas far as\u201d the exercise of those capacities\n\u201creaches\u201d (II.xxvii.9): \u201cFor the same consciousness\nbeing preserv\u2019d, whether in the same or different Substances,\nthe personal Identity is preserv\u2019d\u201d (II.xxvii.13).  Thus\nthe way is clear for Locke to assert that one and the same person may\nbe resurrected even if that person comes to inhabit an altogether\ndifferent body than any with which she was previously associated\n(II.xxvii.15).\n\nIt is in the context of his solution to this problem that Locke\nintroduces the famous thought experiment involving the prince and the\ncobbler\u2014not as a puzzle in need of explanation, but as a case\nwhose apparent plausibility vindicates the human/person distinction\n(and thereby, his solution to the problem of the resurrection). If\n\n\u201cthe soul of the prince, carrying with it the consciousness of\nthe Prince\u2019s past Life, [were to] enter and inform the Body of a\nCobler as soon as deserted by his own Soul\u201d, Locke enjoins his\nreader, \u201cevery one sees, he would be the same Person\nwith the Prince, accountable only for the Prince\u2019s Actions: But\nwho would say it was the same Man?\u201d (II.xxvii.15, emphasis\nadded).  This thought experiment is often taken to support a\npsychological criterion of personal identity. The precise form of such\na criterion has been the subject of much dispute, both in\nLocke\u2019s time and subsequently. Locke himself is sometimes said\n(probably incorrectly) to have advocated a memory criterion, according\nto which a person,\nx, existing at one time, \\(t_1\\), and a person, y,\nexisting at a later time, \\(t_2\\), y is identical with x\nif and only if y remembers experiences had by x. Whether\nor not this was Locke\u2019s view, generally speaking, psychological\ncriteria of personal identity assert that a psychological relation of\nsome sort (i.e. a relation involving memory, characteristics and\ndispositions, beliefs, desires, rationality, etc.) is necessary and/or\nsufficient for each of us to persist through time.\n\nAnother important dimension of the human/person distinction is also\nsignaled in this example, viz. the person as locus of moral\naccountability. On Locke\u2019s view, it is in virtue of their\ncapacities for self-consciousness and rationality that persons not\nonly persist through time, but also are prudentially concerned and\nmorally and legally responsible for actions committed at other times.\nAccording to Locke, a person should be punished only for those actions\nthat she can remember having committed (II.xxvii.20). This is true not\nonly in the case of divine law carried out on judgment day\u2014when\n\u201cthe secrets of all Hearts shall be laid open\u201d\nand rewards and punishments meted out for the good and bad deeds\nundertaken throughout the course of our lives (II.xxvii.26)\u2014but\nalso, more generally, in the course of everyday legal and moral\naffairs. So it is that \u2018person\u2019 functions as \u201ca\nForensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit\u201d (ibid.)\nand in \u201cpersonal Identity is founded all the Right and\nJustice of Reward and Punishment\u201d (II.xxvii.18).\n\nIn discussing these normative aspects of personhood, Locke raises and\nanswers an obvious objection in a way that anticipates some strains of\nthe contemporary debate. \u201cSuppose\u201d, he says,\n\n\nI wholly lose the memory of some parts of my Life, beyond a\npossibility of retrieving them, so that perhaps I shall never be\nconscious of them again; yet am I not the same Person, that did those\nActions, had those Thoughts, that I was once conscious of, though I\nhave now forgot them? (II.xxvii.20)\n\n\nLocke replies that, although they typically refer to both the same\nhuman animal and the same person, self-referring personal pronouns can\nbe equivocal. So the question \u201cDid I do such and so?\u201d can\nbe ambiguous as between \u201cDid the person to which \u2018I\u2019\npresently refers do such and so?\u201d and \u201cDid the human\nanimal to which \u2018I\u2019 presently refers do such and\nso?\u201d In Locke\u2019s amnesiac case, the answer to the first\nquestion is no, while the answer to the second question is yes:\n\u201cthe Word I is applied to \u2026 the Man only\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nTwo aspects of Locke\u2019s discussion of this case are salient to\nthe contemporary discussion. The first, of course, is the view that,\nif I am incapable of recalling having done this or that, then the\nperson responsible for the action in question is not the person I am,\neven if the person who is responsible for that action occupied the\nsame human animal presently occupied by the person I am (see Johansson\n2016, D. Shoemaker 2009, 2016, and Sauchelli 2017a). The second is the\nidea that the first-person pronoun can refer equivocally in a way that\n tracks the human/person distinction (see\n section 3.2).\n\nA host of interpretive questions can be raised concerning the\nhistorical distinction between human animals and persons, and some of\nthese may be of interest to participants in the contemporary debate\nbetween animalism and its rivals. For example, whether Locke\u2019s\ndistinction reflects a conceptual or an ontological difference remains\na point of controversy amongst historians of the period (e.g., Bolton\n1994; Chappell 1989; Thiel 1997 and 1998). But setting aside these\nscholarly matters, the features of Locke\u2019s distinction that are\nuncontroversially endorsed by Locke as well as especially relevant for\nthe current debate include the following:\n\nour capacities for self-consciousness and rationality are tied not\nto our being human animals, but to our being persons;\n the locus of moral responsibility is not the human animal, but\nthe person;\n persons, but not human animals, persist just in case their\npsychological states are linked in appropriate ways; and\n during the course of its life, a human animal may coincide with\nzero, one, or more than one person, and something need not be a human\nanimal in order to be occupied by a person (e.g., Locke\u2019s\nrational parrot).\n\n2.2 Animalism and the Human/Person Distinction\n\nIt should be emphasized at this point that animalists do not deny that\nthere is a distinction to be drawn between human animals and persons.\nThis, in part, is why the formulation of (1) that is sometimes\nascribed to animalists\u2014\u201cpersons are human\nanimals\u201d\u2014is misleading. In fact, there are several aspects\nof Locke\u2019s discussion that animalists uphold.\n\nFor example, animalists often ally their answer to the persistence\nquestion with Locke\u2019s identity criteria for human animals (e.g.,\nOlson 2007: 28). Of course, since organic animalists affirm and\nsomatic animalists deny that being alive is a necessary condition of\nour persistence, Locke cannot be an ally to both camps. For his part,\nD. Mackie (1999b: 235\u201339) classifies Locke as an organicist.\nHowever, enough passages from the Essay suggest otherwise\n(some of which Mackie himself acknowledges\u2014e.g., in\nII.xxvii.4\u20135) that the more circumspect conclusion may be that\nLocke was either inconsistent or just ambivalent on the matter.\nAnimalists are also sympathetic to Locke\u2019s account of\npersonhood\u2014albeit with a different understanding of the type of\nconcept person is\u2014and this alternative understanding\nallows animalists to endorse element (d) above.\n\nWhat animalists reject is Locke\u2019s claim that\n\u2018person\u2019 names a sortal concept (e.g., Snowdon 2014: ch.\n3). Rather, following Olson (1997: ch. 2), most animalists insist that\n\u2018person\u2019 names only a phase sortal concept (or\nstatus concept, see Hacker 2007). (The idea of a\n\u201cphased sortal\u201d, as he called them, is due to Wiggins\n[1967, 2001].) Unlike a sortal concept, which determines the\npersistence conditions of its instances, a phase sortal concept is a\nconcept to which its instances belong temporarily, for only a phase of\ntheir existence (e.g., teenager). Simply by reaching a\nparticular age, for example, something that was not a teenager can\nbecome a teenager without ceasing to exist. Likewise, something that\nwas a teenager can cease to be a teenager without ceasing to exist. So\ntoo, animalists say, with person. Personhood, they claim, is\na phase that something begins upon acquiring the psychological\ncapacities that Locke identifies (self-consciousness and rationality)\nand concludes upon losing those capacities. In this way, being a\nperson is a matter of what something can do, rather than what\nsomething is. In Olson terminology, person is a\n\u201cfunctional kind\u201d, akin to locomotor (1997:\n31\u201337). A locomotor is anything that is able to move about under\nits own power, be it a garden slug or a ballistic missile. Likewise,\nOlson argues (following Locke), a person is anything that is able to\nthink in certain ways\u2014anything that \u201cis rational, \u2026\nordinarily conscious and aware of itself as tracing a path through\ntime and space, \u2026 [and] morally accountable for its\nactions\u201d (1997: 32). Many things besides human animals can be\npersons on this view: an angel, a god, a machine, an animal, an\nimmaterial soul, an alien, etc.. In the case of human animals, we\nordinarily become persons not at conception or at birth, but around\nthe age of two. And while it is possible for a human animal to go out\nof existence at the same moment that she ceases to be a person (e.g.,\nif she steps on an active landmine), it is also possible for a human\nanimal to continue existing long after he has ceased to be a person\n(e.g., if he lapses into a persistent vegetative state).\n2.3 Animalism(s) vs. Neo-Lockeanism(s)\n\nAnimalism\u2019s principal rival is not infrequently identified as\n\u201cneo-Lockeanism\u201d. This way of staging the debate dates\nback at least as far as a prominent exchange between Noonan (1998,\n2001) and D. Mackie (1999a). Also, the first monograph dedicated to\nanimalism mounts a sustained attack on the \u201cpsychological\napproach\u201d to personal identity\u2014an approach whose\n\u201cbest-known advocate \u2026 is, of course, Locke\u201d (Olson\n1997: 20). And the \u201canimalism vs. neo-Lockeanism\u201d\nopposition remains common in contemporary discussions (e.g., S.\nCampbell 2001; Hershenov 2012; Johnston 2010; Robinson 2016; S.\nShoemaker 2008).\n\nIn one respect, setting things up in this way is fairly harmless.\nViews classified as \u201cneo-Lockean\u201d share a common\ncommitment to a psychological criterion of personal identity (whether\nthat criterion requires direct psychological connectedness or merely\noverlapping chains of psychological continuity) that animalists\nuniversally oppose. But ultimately, the simple \u201canimalism vs.\nneo-Lockeanism\u201d dichotomy is too coarse-grained and exclusionary\nto provide a particularly informative taxonomy of the contemporary\ndebate. For example, whilst all animalists resist a psychological\ncriterion of persistence, the distinction between organic and somatic\nanimalisms\n (section 1.2)\n shows us that the source of this resistance varies significantly.\nAnd, as the list given above indicates\n (section 1.1),\n animalism\u2019s answer to the fundamental nature question is\nopposed by a wide range of views, not all of which are properly\nclassified as neo-Lockean. Moreover, as we shall see in what follows,\nthe \u201cneo-Lockeanism\u201d label both obscures importantly\ndifferent varieties of neo-Lockeanism and ignores different rationales\ngiven for those views.\n\nWhilst a comprehensive taxonomy of alternatives to animalism is\nneither feasible nor necessary in the present context, one step in the\nright direction would be to differentiate those neo-Lockean views that\nrely on the notion of material constitution from those that do not.\nThose that do\u2014call this type of view \u201cconstitutionalist\nneo-Lockeanism\u201d\u2014are today regarded as the leading\nopposition to animalism. Advocates of this form of neo-Lockeanism\n(including Baker, Johnston, and S. Shoemaker) contend that each of us\n\u201cis\u201d an animal only in the sense that (according to some)\na statue \u201cis\u201d the piece of marble, viz. by being\nmaterially colocated and yet distinguished by one or more modal,\ntemporal, and/or relational properties. On this view, we are persons\nnon-identically constituted by human animals.\n\nDespite this common reliance on the notion of material constitution,\nthere are significant differences between the views advocated by\nanimalism\u2019s constitutionalist neo-Lockean opponents. According\nto S. Shoemaker (1984), for instance, it is the capacity for thought\nthat distinguishes the mental subject you are from the human animal\nthat constitutes you. Partly because it is embedded within his\nbroader, functionalist response to the mind/body problem,\nShoemaker\u2019s arguments against animalism and animal thought are\ncomplex (see\n section 3.2\n for further discussion). But roughly, on his view, animals are\nincapable of thinking because they do not persist under the\nappropriate conditions. Psychological continuity is sufficient for the\npersistence of any being endowed with the capacity to think, and since\npsychological continuity is not sufficient for a (human) animal to\npersist, animals are not thinking beings. And because each of us is a\nthinking being, we are not animals. (For a thorough presentation of\nShoemaker\u2019s most recent thinking on this topic, see his 1999,\n2004, 2008, 2011, 2016.)\n\nPerhaps the most extensive elaboration of the constitutionalist\napproach has been given by Baker (2000, 2002, 2007). On her view, the\nproperty that distinguishes the persons we are from the human animals\nthat constitute us is a form of self-consciousness that she calls the\n\u201cfirst-person perspective\u201d (2000: ch. 3). It is from this\nperspective that \u201cone thinks of oneself as an individual facing\na world, as a subject distinct from everything else\u201d; it is what\nenables us \u201cto conceive of one\u2019s body and mental states as\none\u2019s own\u201d (2000: 60, 4). On her view, persons have their\nfirst-person perspectives essentially, and they \u201cpersist as long\nas [their] first-person perspectives are exemplified\u201d (2016: 51;\nsee also 2000: 132\u201341).\n\nAt the heart of this view is what Baker has recently labeled her\n\u201cKey Distinction\u201d (2007: 43; 2016: 53). Constitutionalists\nmaintain that constituting objects (e.g., pieces of marble) and\nconstituted objects (e.g., statues) can share some of their\nproperties. For instance, a statue shares its physical and aesthetic\nproperties with the piece of marble that constitutes it; likewise,\nBaker will claim, a person shares its physical and psychological\nproperties with the human animal that constitutes it. But these\nobjects cannot share all of their properties in the same way, or else\nthere would be no difference between the constituting and the\nconstituted. So Baker draws an exhaustive and mutually exclusive\ndistinction between two ways that objects can instantiate properties:\nderivatively or nonderivatively. Roughly, an object has a property\nderivatively if it instantiates it only in virtue of being colocated\nwith another object, whereas an object instantiates a property\nnonderivatively if it instantiates that property independently of\nbeing colocated with another object. We might express this distinction\nmore perspicuously as follows. If one object (x) constitutes\nanother object (y) and both objects instantiate some property\n(F), then\n\n x (the constituting object) instantiates F\nnonderivatively in the event it would instantiate F even if it\ndid not constitute y (the constituted object);\n y instantiates F nonderivatively in the event that\nx would fail to instantiate F if x did not\nconstitute y; and\n y instantiates F derivatively in the event that\nx would instantiate F even if it did not constitute\ny.\n\n\nConsider, for example, a marble statue of a giant ogre. In this case,\n(i) the piece of marble instantiates the property of being three\nmeters tall nonderivatively (because it would be three meters tall\neven if it did not constitute the statue); (ii) the statue\ninstantiates the property of being ugly nonderivatively (because the\npiece of marble with which it is colocated would not be ugly if it did\nnot constitute a statue); and (iii) the statue instantiates the\nproperty of being three meters tall derivatively (because the piece of\nmarble would be three meters tall even if it did not constitute the\nstatue). (Still more precise elaborations of Baker\u2019s Key\nDistinction are given in her 2000: 46\u201358 and 2007: 166\u201369.\nA number of critics have argued that the distinction generates more\nheat than light; see, e.g., Hershenov 2009; Olson 2007: ch. 3;\nZimmerman 2002; and contributions to the \nField Guide to the Philosophy of Mind \nonline symposium on Baker 2000.)\n\nBaker argues by analogy that, as it goes for marble statues, so it\ngoes for human persons. On her view, each of us is an animal, but\n(contra the animalist) only derivatively. Baker\u2019s\nanswer to the fundamental nature question is that we are persons; each\nof us possesses the first-person perspective essentially and\nnonderivatively. In the course of ordinary development, a human animal\ndevelops increasingly sophisticated psychological capacities (just\nlike the piece of marble develops aesthetic characteristics as the\nsculptor chisels away at it). Once these capacities include a\nfirst-person perspective, a person comes into existence, and this\nperson is constituted by the human animal (2000: 115\u201316; cf.\n2007: 72\u201382). Since the animal would not have a first-person\nperspective if it did not come to constitute the person, it shares\nthis perspective with the person in the same way that the piece of\nmarble shares the property of being ugly with the statue of the ogre,\nviz. derivatively.\n\nOn Baker\u2019s view, the first-person perspective is unique to\npersons. Without this perspective, she argues, a being cannot refer to\nitself using first-person pronouns, for this ability requires that one\nbe able to conceive of oneself both as the subject of mental events\nand as the object that embodies the subject of those events. Because\nthe human animal that constitutes you possesses a first-person\nperspective only derivatively, then, it is unable to self-refer. That\nsaid, Baker does not claim that person-constituting human animals lack\ncognitive and experiential capacities altogether. Nor does she claim\nthat they possess these capacities only derivatively. Like many of the\n\u201chigher\u201d nonhuman animals, human animals are subjects of\nan array of mental phenomena, including pains and pleasures, beliefs\nand desires. Such phenomena require not the \u201cstrong\u201d or\n\u201crobust\u201d first-person perspective characteristic of\npersons, but only what Baker calls a \u201cweak\u201d or\n\u201crudimentary\u201d first-person perspective\u2014roughly, the\ncapacity to experience the world from an egocentric point of view\n(2000: 60\u201364). And just as the statue inherits the property of\nbeing three meters tall from the piece of marble, so too the person\npossesses these lesser psychological capacities only derivatively\nbecause the human animal would possess these capacities even if it did\nnot constitute the person.\n\nNeo-Lockean resistance to animalism that is not linked to\nconstitutionalism is an even more diverse lot. One of the prevailing\nviews in the non-constitutionalist neo-Lockeanism category rejects\nanimalism by identifying the person with a proper part of the human\nanimal\u2014typically, the brain or one of its (spatial or temporal)\nparts. On this view, the human animal thinks only derivatively, in\nvirtue of having a thinking brain as a part. Among those who advocate\nviews along this line are Puccetti (1973), Persson (1999), McMahan\n(2002), Hudson (2001), and more recently Parfit (2012). Animalist\nresponses to these views are given by Hershenov (2005b, 2016) and\nOlson (2007: ch. 4). Also relevant are the various thought experiments\nraised by non-constitutionalist neo-Lockeans (e.g., Lewis 1976; Parfit\n1984) that seem to count against animalism; for instance, thought\nexperiments involving teletransportation and transplantation. See\n section 3.4\n for some discussion of these cases.\n3. Arguments for and Objections to Animalism\n\nParticularly when introduced in isolation, animalism\u2014especially\n(1)\u2014might strike one as obviously true. In his book-length\ntreatment of the view, Snowdon demonstrates at length how animalism\n\u201crepresents the default conception of ourselves\u201d (2014:\n106). And in an earlier article, he notes:\n\n\nThe central claim of animalism is in some ways a curious proposition\nto assert. It is natural to respond to its assertion in the words of\nWittgenstein: \u201cOnly whom are we informing of this? And on what\noccasion?\u201d. (1995: 72; Wittgenstein 1953: 101e)\n\n\nOlson echoes this sentiment, writing that we certainly\n\n\nseem to be animals. When you eat or sleep or talk, a human\nanimal eats, sleeps, or talks. When you look in the mirror, and animal\nlooks back at you. Most ordinary people suppose that we are animals.\n\u2026 Compared with [competing] proposals, the idea that we are\nanimals looks like plain common sense. (2007: 23)\n\n\nBut common sense will not settle the issue because some of\nanimalism\u2019s rivals are supported by other, equally intuitive\nconsiderations. In addition to common sense, then, what arguments can\nbe marshaled in support of animalism?\n3.1 Thinking Animal Argument\n\nThe standard argument for (1) is variously referred to as the\n\u201cthinking animal argument\u201d (Olson 1997, 2003), the\n\u201ctoo many minds objection\u201d (S. Shoemaker 1999), the\n\u201ctwo lives objection\u201d (S. Campbell 2006), and the\n\u201ctoo many thinkers problem\u201d (Parfit 2012: 7). It was\ndeveloped by Snowdon (1990: 91), Carter (1988), McDowell (1997: 237),\nand Ayers (1991, vol. 2: 283). It has since been sharpened and\npopularized by Olson (1997: 106\u201309, 2003: 325\u201330, 2007:\n29\u201339). Here it is:\n\n(P1)Presently sitting\nin your chair is a human animal.\n(P2)The human animal\nsitting in your chair is thinking.\n(P3)You are the\nthinking being sitting in your chair.\n(C)Therefore, the\nhuman animal sitting in your chair is you.\n\n\nWhilst none of (P1), (P2), and (P3) is incontestable, nor is any one\nof them easily contested. Save perhaps for far-reaching metaphysical\nreasons (e.g., an antecedent commitment to idealism), few would deny\nthe very existence of animals, nor the fact that a perfectly good\nspecimen of the species Homo sapiens is presently seated in\nyour chair. So (P1) is not easily rejected.\n\nMoreover, concerning (P2), since it would be odd (to say the least) to\ndeny that human animals think while accepting that porpoises and\nporcupines do, and since we can assume that the human animal in your\nchair is not atypical of its kind, whatever reasons one has for\naccepting that various nonhuman animals think apply equally to the\nhuman animal in your chair. While there are those who deny (in a\nsense) that any animal can think (e.g., Descartes, Johnston, S.\nShoemaker), their positions strain empirical credibility and/or depend\non fairly sophisticated metaphysical machinery. At first glance,\nanyway, (P2) is much easier to accept.\n\n(P3) is also difficult to resist, since its denial would seem to\nrequire positing the existence of a thinking being in your chair other\nthan yourself. For if (P1) and (P2) are true, and if it is true that\nyou exist and are thinking, then denying (P3) results in the\nimplication that you are but one of (at least) two thinkers seated in\nyour chair. Such a view faces a host of difficult questions: practical\nquestions (e.g., which of these beings owns the car parked out\nfront?), epistemic questions (how do you determine which of these\nbeings you are?), linguistic questions (to which of these beings do\ninstances of the first-person pronoun refer?), ontological questions\n(what is the relationship between you and the qualitatively identical\nbeing with which you are associated?), and so on. These challenges\nhave not passed unnoticed, and serious attempts have been made to\naddress them. But, the animalist says, the trouble can be avoided from\nthe start simply by conceding the truth of (P3).\n\nSo, while not necessarily unanswerable or insurmountable, the\nquestions and problems that await one who rejects any of (P1) through\n(P3) are not insignificant. Animalism, then, has at least this much\ngoing for it.\n3.2 Replies to the Thinking Animal Argument\n\nNot all replies to the thinking animal argument have focused\nexclusively on, or even addressed themselves directly, to one or the\nother of the three premises that make up that argument. Nevertheless,\nmany replies to animalism do concern questions raised by the thinking\nanimal argument and may fruitfully be seen as addressing one or\nanother of its premises.\n\nFor instance, according to Baker\u2019s (2000, 2007) constitution\nview, (P3) should be rejected, since \u201cthinking being sitting in\nyour chair\u201d is ambiguous as between the constituted person who\nthinks nonderivatively and the constituting human animal who thinks\nderivatively\n (section 2.3).\n And Noonan (1998, 2001) also detects an ambiguity in (P2) and (P3).\nAccording to his revisionist view of personal pronoun use,\nfirst-person thoughts and utterances refer only to persons, not to\nanimals. On his view, we must distinguish between the referent of\nfirst-person thoughts and utterances, on the one hand, and the thinker\nof those thoughts and utterances, on the other hand. Noonan does not\ndeny that the human animal sitting in your chair is capable of\nfirst-personal thinking. Nor does he deny that such thoughts (and the\nutterances that express them) successfully refer. But he does insist\nthat, when the animal has a first-person thought or utters\n\u2018I\u2019, that thought or utterance refers not to the animal\nwho thinks the thought but to the person with whom the animal shares\nits thoughts. (For further discussion, see Noonan 2012 and Olson\n2002a, 2007: 37\u201339.)\n\nAnd, although not initially developed as a response to the thinking\nanimal argument, S. Shoemaker\u2019s (1984, 1999, 2004) view\nrepresents a direct and formidable challenge to (P2). On his account,\nthe human animal sitting in your chair is not thinking because no\nanimal is capable of thinking. This in turn is because the capacity\nfor thought requires persistence conditions that all animals, human or\notherwise, lack: \u201cmental properties\u201d, Shoemaker writes,\n\u201ccan belong only to things having psychological persistence\nconditions\u201d (2004: 528). A thinker\u2019s psychological states\nplay characteristic causal roles, and these states (in combination\nwith others) tend to cause the thinking being whose states they are to\nbehave in certain ways. Thus, for example, the state of being in pain\nmay be caused by bodily damage of some kind and may dispose the one\nwho is in pain to cry out or recoil.\n\nThe linchpin of Shoemaker\u2019s view is his claim that the causal\nrole of any psychological state as well as any other states involved\nin that causal role must all be states of one and the same thinking\nbeing (1999: 300). In other words, the effects typically brought about\nby a being\u2019s psychological states cannot fail to occur in that\nvery being. Olson summarizes the consequence of this commitment as\nfollows:\n\n\nif your cerebrum gets put into my head tomorrow, your current mental\nstates will have their characteristic effects in the being who ends up\nwith that organ, and not in the empty-headed thing left behind. By\nShoemaker\u2019s reasoning, the subject of those\nstates\u2014you\u2014must therefore be the being who ends up with\nyour transplanted cerebrum. Any being whose later states or actions\nare caused in the appropriate way by your current mental states must\nbe you. In other words, psychological continuity of a sort must\nsuffice for you or any other mental being to persist through time.\nSince no sort of psychological continuity suffices for any organism to\npersist \u2026 it follows that no organism could have mental\nproperties. The nature of mental properties makes it metaphysically\nimpossible for animals to think. (Olson 2007: 33\u201334.)\n\n\nShoemaker\u2019s functionalist theory of mind has received\nconsiderable attention in the philosophy of mind. His view that\nanimals cannot think and the implications of that claim for the\nthinking animal argument are discussed in \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir\n2010, Hershenov 2006, Olson 2002b, and S. Shoemaker 2004, 2008, 2011,\n2016.\n\nBeyond these discussions of (P2) and (P3), much of the recent\ndiscussion concerning animalism has focused on such questions as\nwhether one or more than one thinker is sitting in your chair; if more\nthan one, which one is doing the thinking; and in what sense.\nZimmerman (2008), for instance, objects to (P1) by noting that the\nrationale for the claim that a human animal is located where you\nare\u2014in effect, that it is just obvious that there is an instance\nof the species Homo sapiens currently located where you\nare\u2014extends equally to such things as \u201cmere hunk of\nmatter\u201d, \u201cmere body\u201d, \u201cpsychological\nperson\u201d, and the like. Since the animalist does not accept that\nwe are identical to any of these non-animals, the evident truth of\n(P1) will not be sufficient to establish the thinking animal\nargument\u2019s conclusion. What is required, in other words, is not\nsimply a reason for believing that (P1) is true\u2014animalists, let\nus assume, are correct in insisting that few would deny it\u2014but\nalso a reason for denying the presence of other things besides a human\nanimal. This is the \u201crival candidates problem\u201d.\n\nClosely related to this problem is another. The \u201cthinking parts\nproblem\u201d charges that, even if you are a thinking being, no\nreason has been given to suppose that you are a thinking\nanimal rather than any of the other thinking beings currently\nlocated where you are. To begin, consider all the parts of a human\nanimal that are plausibly regarded as thinking: the head, the brain,\nthe right-leg complement (i.e., the entire animal body minus the right\nleg), the entire animal from the waist up (torso, neck, and head), the\nleft-arm complement minus a single electron in the animal\u2019s\nliver, the left-arm complement minus a different electron in the\nanimal\u2019s liver, etc. For each of these thinking parts, an\nargument structurally analogous to the thinking animal argument could\nbe constructed. For instance:\n\n(P1\u2032)There is a\nhuman head currently located where you are.\n(P2\u2032)The human\nhead currently located where you are is thinking.\n(P3\u2032)You are the\nthinking being located in your chair.\n(C\u2032)Therefore,\nthe human head located where you are is you.\n\n\nLikewise:\n\n(P1\u2033)There is a\ntorso-neck-and-head currently located where you are.\n(P2\u2033)The\ntorso-neck-and-head currently located where you are is\nthinking.\n(P3\u2032)You are the\nthinking being located in your chair.\n(C\u2033)Therefore,\nthe torso-neck-and-head located where you are is you.\n\n\nAnd so on. If the thinking animal argument were sound, then it would\nfollow (per impossibile) that you are identical with each of\nan infinite number of nonidentical thinking parts. Since you could be\nidentical with no more than one of those things, and since the\nanimalist has provided no principled explanation for why you are the\nwhole animal and not one or another of the animal\u2019s thinking\nparts, the thinking animal argument should be rejected.\n\nMuch of the discussion about animalism has been concerned with the\nrival candidates and thinking parts problems. (See, for instance,\nBlatti 2016; Lowe 2001; Madden 2016a; Olson 2007: 215\u201319 and\n2015; Parfit 2012; Yang 2015.) One line of response draws on van\nInwagen\u2019s (1990) view of composite material beings. According to\nvan Inwagen\u2019s answer to what he calls the \u201cspecial\ncomposition question\u201d, the only composite objects that exist are\nliving organisms. Only a living organism unifies the particles that\ncompose it at any given moment, on this view. Such things as\n\u201cmere hunk of matter\u201d and \u201cright-leg\ncomplement\u201d are gerrymandered objects. And since they are not\ngenuine composite objects, they are neither genuine rivals nor genuine\nthinkers. Olson (2008: 38\u201342) is, however, quick to acknowledge\nthat this riposte will be welcomed only by those antecedently\npersuaded of van Inwagen\u2019s view. And proponents of the rival\ncandidates and thinking parts problems are particularly unlikely to\ncount among van Inwagen\u2019s supporters.\n3.3 Animal Ancestors Argument\n\nEven if these objections to the thinking animal argument can be\nanswered, there is some irony in the fact that the fate of the\nhallmark argument for animalism should hang in the balance of disputes\nover the nature of mental properties and the individuation of\nthinkers. Thought is an essential ingredient not in animalism\u2019s\ntheory of our fundamental nature, but in the theories advanced by\nanimalism\u2019s neo-Lockean rivals. It is precisely our capacity for\nthought that animalists deny is essential to us; on the contrary,\nanimalists say, each of us was once a non-thinking fetus and each of\nus may yet become a non-thinking persistent-vegetative-state\npatient.\n\nThus, a second argument attempts to ground animalism\u2019s defense\nin a broader naturalistic context. The \u201canimal ancestors\nargument\u201d takes the form of a reductio. If (1) is false and we\nare not animals, then nor are our parents animals, in which case nor\nare our parents\u2019 parents, nor our parents\u2019 grandparents,\nand so on, as far back as our ancestries extend. But in that case, the\nfalsity of animalism entails the rejection of evolutionary theory (or\nat least that theory\u2019s applicability to us), since it denies\nthat our distant ancestries includes beings who were animals. But,\nsince the rejection of evolutionary theory is too high a price to pay,\nit is instead the assumption of animalism\u2019s falsity that ought\nto be rejected. Whilst Blatti (2012) argues that this argument\nwithstands a number of extant objections, it also faces challenges\n(Daly and Liggins 2013, Gillett 2013).\n3.4 Further Objections, Implications, and Questions\n\nThe rival candidates and thinking parts problems are instances of what\nwe might call \u201cmultiplication objections\u201d to animalism.\nThese objections try to demonstrate how advocates of animalism are\ncommitted to claiming (or incapable of denying) that one thing (you or\nme, say) is identical to each of two or more things. Yet another such\nobjection is inspired by a rare type of conjoined twinning called\ndicephalus, which occurs when a human zygote divides only partially\nbefore implanting in the uterine wall. The result is twins conjoined\nbelow the neck. These twins look like a two-headed person, with\ndistinct heads and necks sprouting from a single torso (Miller 1996).\nAccording to McMahan (2002: 35), because a pair of dicephalic twins is\ntwo people but only one animal, dicephalic twins appear to present a\nwalking, talking counterexample to animalism\u2019s hallmark claim,\n(1). (For further discussion, see Blatti 2007; T. Campbell and McMahan\n2016; Liao 2006; Olson 2014; Reid 2016.)\n\nOther objections aim to reveal animalism\u2019s counterintuitive\nverdicts concerning the seemingly endless litany of fantastical\nthought experiments (many of them updated versions of Locke\u2019s\nprince-cobbler case, see\n section 2.1)\n debated in the recent personal identity literature (S. Shoemaker\n1963; Lewis 1976; Wiggins 1980; Parfit 1984). In one scenario, we are\nto imagine removing all or part (e.g., cerebrum) of your brain and\ntransplanting it into a different (brain-less or cerebrum-less) human\nanimal, with the (ex hypothesi) result that your\npsychological life and characteristics are continued in a different\nanimal from the one you presently occupy. Another scenario envisions a\nsimilar feat via fanciful technology that can record all of your brain\nstates and transfer that information into a different animal\u2019s\nbrain (previously wiped clean). Still another thought experiment\nimagines transporting you \u00e0 la Star Trek by creating a\nblueprint of your physical and psychological states at one location,\ndestroying you, and then replicating you at some distant location by\ncreating a new object with all of the same physical and psychological\nstates.\n\nThe differences between the details of these thought experiments are\nnot insignificant. But for present purposes, let us collect them\ntogether under the label \u201ctransfer objections\u201d, since the\nintuition all of them aim to arouse is that you can be\nrelocated from one animal or location to another as a result of the\nprocesses described, so long as your memories, beliefs, desires,\ncharacter traits, etc. are preserved. If the transferability intuition\nis correct, then (1) cannot be true, since psychological continuity is\nnot sufficient for the persistence of a human animal. Indeed, for any\nof the procedures described in these cases\u2014brain-transplant,\nbrain-state transplant, teletransportation\u2014given the choice\nbetween undergoing this procedure and annihilation, animalism entails\nthat there is no self-interested reason to prefer the former.\n\nThe felt conviction of our prima facie beliefs about what\nwould happen in these scenarios seems undeniable. Moreover, there is\nevidence to suggest that intuitions supporting some version of the\npsychological criterion are not only firmly felt, but quite common\n(Nichols and Bruno 2010). So how do animalists respond? While many\nanimalists will concede the intuitions we have about these and other\ncases, they will also point out that we harbor many other\npre-philosophical commitments besides. We are, for instance, strongly\ninclined to believe that many animals (human and otherwise) are\ncapable of thinking (including remembering, believing, desiring,\netc.). Likewise, we believe that there is just one thinker located\nwhere each of us is. But if, say, the intuition in the\nbrain-transplant case is correct and you go with your brain when it\ngets transplanted into another body, then either the human animal left\nbehind was never capable of thinking (since the brain was thinking and\nthere was only one thinker in the vicinity) or there were multiple\nthinkers thinking your thoughts prior to the transplant (your animal\nand your brain). Surely these implications offend our\npre-philosophical beliefs about ourselves too. Consequently, if there\nare answers to be had to the fundamental nature and persistence\nquestions, then it is likely that those answers will reveal some of\nour pre-philosophical convictions to be correct, others not. (For\nfurther discussion, see Gendler 2002; Madden 2016b; Olson 1997;\nSnowdon 1991, 1995, 2014: chs. 10\u201311; and Wilkes 1988. And see\nSnowdon 2003 for a more thorough taxonomy of objections to\nanimalism.)\n\nFinally, beyond its contribution to the ancient debate over personal\nidentity, animalism raises practical questions of great contemporary\nsignificance. For example, animalists are committed to claiming that\neach of us was once or might someday become a non-person (e.g., a\nfetus in a mother\u2019s womb, a hospital patient in a persistent\nvegetative state). How are we to reconcile these implications of a\nmetaphysical view with our ethical commitments regarding abortion and\neuthanasia? More generally, if animalism is correct, then our\nfundamental nature is indistinguishable from that of blue whales, myna\nbirds, bonobo chimpanzees, and ring-tailed lemurs. How, in the light\nof this metaphysical view, are the ethical, legal, and policy debates\nthat assume a sharp human/animal (us/them) contrast to be\nrecalibrated? Such questions are only beginning to be explored (see,\ne.g., Johansson 2016; Sauchelli forthcoming, 2017a: ch. 5; D.\nShoemaker 2009, 2013, 2016).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["\u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir, Steinv\u00f6r Th\u00f6ll, 2010,\n\u201cFunctionalism and Thinking Animals\u201d, <em>Philosophical\nStudies</em>, 147(3): 347\u2013354. doi:10.1007/s11098-008-9287-0", "Atherton, Margaret, 1983, \u201cLocke\u2019s Theory of Personal\nIdentity\u201d, <em>Midwest Studies in Philosophy</em>, 8: 273\u2013293.\ndoi:10.1111/j.1475-4975.1983.tb00470.x", "Ayers, Michael, 1991, <em>Locke</em>, 2 vols., London:\nRoutledge.", "Baker, Lynne Rudder, 1997, \u201cWhy Constitution Is Not\nIdentity\u201d, <em>The Journal of Philosophy</em>, 94(12): 599.\ndoi:10.2307/2564596", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1999, \u201cWhat Am I?\u201d,\n<em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>, 59(1):\n151\u2013159. doi:10.2307/2653462", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2000, <em>Persons and Bodies: A\nConstitution View</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.\ndoi:10.1017/CBO9781139173124", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2002, \u201cThe Ontological Status of\nPersons\u201d, <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>,\n65(2): 370\u2013388. doi:10.1111/j.1933-1592.2002.tb00207.x", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2007, <em>The Metaphysics of Everyday Life:\nAn Essay in Practical Realism</em>, Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511487545", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cAnimalism vs.\nConstitutionalism\u201d, in Blatti and Snowdon (eds) 2016: 50\u201363.\ndoi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608751.003.0003", "Bailey, Andrew M., 2016, \u201cYou Are an Animal\u201d, <em>Res\nPhilosophica</em>, 93(1): 205\u2013218.\ndoi:10.11612/resphil.2016.93.1.9", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2017, \u201cOur Animal Interests\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Studies</em>, 174(9): 2315\u20132328.\ndoi:10.1007/s11098-016-0800-6", "Belshaw, Christopher, 2011, \u201cAnimals, Identity and\nPersistence\u201d, <em>Australasian Journal of Philosophy</em>,\n89(3): 401\u2013419. doi:10.1080/00048402.2010.497190", "Blatti, Stephan, 2007, \u201cAnimalism, Dicephalus, and\nBorderline Cases\u201d, <em>Philosophical Psychology</em>, 20(5):\n595\u2013608. doi:10.1080/09515080701540867", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2012, \u201cA New Argument for\nAnimalism\u201d, <em>Analysis</em>, 72(4): 685\u2013690.\ndoi:10.1093/analys/ans102", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2016, \u201cHeadhunters\u201d, in Blatti\nand Snowdon (eds.) 2016: 162\u2013179.\ndoi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199608751.003.0008", "Blatti, Stephan and Paul F.
