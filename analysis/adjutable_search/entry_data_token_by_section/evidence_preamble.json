    "main_text": "\n\nFor my own part, I think that if one were looking for a single\nphrase to capture the stage to which philosophy has progressed,\n\u2018the study of evidence\u2019 would be a better choice than\n\u2018the study of language\u2019.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014A.J. Ayer, Philosophy in the Twentieth\nCentury\n\n\nAnd when we try to define \u2018evidence\u2019 \u2026 we find it\nvery difficult.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2014R.G. Collingwood, The Idea of\nHistory\n\nThe concept of evidence is central to both epistemology and the\nphilosophy of science. Of course, \u2018evidence\u2019 is hardly a\nphilosopher's term of art: it is not only, or even primarily,\nphilosophers who routinely speak of evidence, but also lawyers and\njudges, historians and scientists, investigative journalists and\nreporters, as well as the members of numerous other professions and\nordinary folk in the course of everyday life. The concept of evidence\nwould thus seem to be on firmer pre-theoretical ground than various\nother concepts which enjoy similarly central standing within\nphilosophy. (Contrast, for example, the epistemologist's\nquasi-technical term \u2018epistemic justification\u2019.)\nWhen one compares philosophical accounts of evidence with the way\nthe concept is often employed in non-philosophical contexts, however,\na tension soon emerges. Consider first the kinds of things which\nnon-philosophers are apt to count as evidence. For the forensics\nexpert, evidence might consist of fingerprints on a gun, a bloodied\nknife, or a semen-stained dress: evidence is, paradigmatically, the\nkind of thing which one might place in a plastic bag and label\n\u2018Exhibit A\u2019. Thus, a criminal defense attorney might float\nthe hypothesis that the evidence which seems to incriminate his client\nwas planted by a corrupt law enforcement official or hope for it to be\nmisplaced by a careless clerk. For an archaeologist, evidence is the\nsort of thing which one might dig up from the ground and carefully\nsend back to one's laboratory for further analysis. Similarly, for the\nhistorian, evidence might consist of hitherto overlooked documents\nrecently discovered in an archive or in an individual's personal\n library.[1]\n Reflection on examples such as these naturally suggests that evidence\nconsists paradigmatically of physical objects, or perhaps, physical\nobjects arranged in certain ways. For presumably, physical objects are\nthe sort of thing which one might place in a plastic bag, dig up from\nthe ground, send to a laboratory, or discover among the belongings of\nan individual of historical interest. \n\n However natural such a picture might be, it is at least somewhat\ndifficult to reconcile with historically prominent philosophical\naccounts of the nature of evidence. Russell, the greatest empiricist\nof the first half of the twentieth century, tended to think of\nevidence as sense data, mental items of one's present\nconsciousness with which one is immediately acquainted. In this, he\nstood squarely within the tradition of classical empiricism. Quine,\nthe greatest empiricist of the second half of the century, maintained\nthroughout his career that evidence consisted of the stimulation of\none's sensory\n receptors.[2]\n The logical positivists held that whatever evidence there is for a\ngiven scientific theory is afforded by observation statements\nor \u2018protocol sentence\u2019, linguistic entities with\nsuitably-restricted contents; the precise nature of the restrictions\nbecame a vigorously contested matter within the tradition\n itself.[3]\n According to one recent and influential study, one's evidence consists\nof the totality of propositions that one knows (Williamson 2000).\nAccording to another, one's evidence consists exclusively of one's current mental states (Conee and Feldman 2004). Within\ncontemporary confirmation theory, a prominent version of Bayesianism is\nnaturally understood as identifying one's evidence with those beliefs\nof which one is psychologically certain. Of course, the suggestion that\none might place sense data, sensory receptor stimulations, known\npropositions, or one's current mental states in a plastic bag (or dig them\nup from the ground, or send them to a laboratory, or \u2026) is of dubious\nintelligibility. From the perspective of much ordinary thought and talk\nabout evidence, much philosophical theorizing about evidence would seem\nto embody a particularly grotesque category mistake. \n\n Moreover, it is not simply that the accounts of evidence that have\nbeen advanced by philosophers stand in at least some prima\nfacie tension with much that is said and thought about evidence\noutside of philosophy. As even the cursory survey offered above makes\nclear, philosophers themselves have offered quite divergent theories\nof what sorts of things are eligible to serve as evidence. What might\naccount for such discrepancies?\n\n One possibility is the following.  Both in and outside of philosophy,\nthe concept of evidence has often been called upon to fill a number of\ndistinct roles. Although some of these roles are complementary, others\nstand in at least some measure of tension with one another. Indeed, as\nwe will see below, it is far from obvious that any one thing could\nplay all of the diverse roles that evidence has at various times been\nexpected to play. Different theories about the nature of evidence\nmight thus naturally emerge from different emphases on the competing\ndemands that have been placed on the concept.  In what follows, I\nsurvey some of the theoretical roles that the concept of evidence has\nbeen asked to play and explore some of the relations among them.\n",
