    "main_text": "\n\nSyrianus (in antiquity known as \u201cthe Great\u201d) was a teacher\nof philosophy and, if we can trust the evidence, of rhetoric in Athens\nduring the late 4th and early 5th centuries CE.\nHe was a slightly younger contemporary of Augustine of Hippo\n(354\u2013430). Born in Alexandria in the second half of the\n4th century, he received his basic education there but\nlater went on to study philosophy under Plutarch of Athens (c.\n350\u2013431/2), who had revived Plato\u2019s Academy. When Plutarch\ndied in 431/2, Syrianus succeeded him as head of the Athenian school.\nDuring this last stage in his life, Syrianus became the teacher of the\nyoung Proclus (410/2\u2013485), who in turn succeeded him as\nscholarch, either immediately or not long after Syrianus\u2019 death\nin 437. The particular circumstances of Syrianus\u2019 life are\nalmost entirely unknown, and of his copious philosophical work only\nthe important commentaries on books Beta (III),\nGamma (IV), and Mu and Nu (XIII\u2013XIV)\nof Aristotle\u2019s Metaphysics survive.\n",
