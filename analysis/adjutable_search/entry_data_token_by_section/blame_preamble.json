    "main_text": "\n\nBlame is a reaction to something of negative normative significance\nabout someone or their behavior. A paradigm case, perhaps, would be\nwhen one person wrongs another, and the latter responds with\nresentment and a verbal rebuke, but of course we also blame others for\ntheir attitudes and characters (see, e.g., Smith 2005). Thus blaming\nscenarios typically involve a wide range of inward and outward\nresponses to a wrongful or bad action, attitude, or character (such\nresponses include: beliefs, desires, expectations, emotions,\nsanctions, and so on). In theorizing about blame, then, philosophers\nhave typically asked two questions:\n\n Which precise reactions and interactions constitute blame?\n Under what conditions is it appropriate to respond in these\nways?\n\n\nMany theorists approach these questions with a larger theoretical\nagenda in mind: for example, in an effort to understand the conditions\nof moral responsibility more generally and the nature of freedom\n(e.g., Wallace 1994), or in an effort to articulate the content of\nmoral properties (e.g., Gibbard 1990). But the questions are\ninteresting in their own right, especially since blame is such a\ncommon feature of moral experience. This entry will critically discuss\nthe answers that have been offered in response to the above questions\nconcerning blame, with the aim of shedding some light on blame\u2019s\nnature, ethics, and significance. (A common but by no means universal\nassumption is that praise is the counterpart of blame; still, it is\nblame that is often taken to be the more significant phenomenon for\nmoral philosophy.)\n",
