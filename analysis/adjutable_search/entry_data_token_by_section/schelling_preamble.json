    "main_text": "\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775\u20131854) is, along\nwith J.G. Fichte and G.W.F. Hegel, one of the three most influential\nthinkers in the tradition of \u2018German Idealism\u2019. Although\nhe is often regarded as a philosophical Proteus who changed his\nconception so radically and so often that it is hard to attribute one\nclear philosophical conception to him, Schelling was in fact often an\nimpressively rigorous logical thinker. In the era during which\nSchelling was writing, so much was changing in philosophy that a\nstable, fixed point of view was as likely to lead to a failure to\ngrasp important new developments as it was to lead to a defensible\nphilosophical system. Schelling\u2019s continuing importance today\nrelates mainly to three aspects of his work. The first is his\nNaturphilosophie, which, although many of its empirical\nclaims are now indefensible, opens up the possibility of a modern\nhermeneutic view of nature that does not restrict nature\u2019s\nsignificance to what can be established about it in scientific terms.\nThe second is his anti-Cartesian account of subjectivity, which\nprefigures some of the most influential ideas of thinkers like\nNietzsche, Heidegger, and Jacques Lacan, in showing how the thinking\nsubject cannot be fully transparent to itself. The third is his later\ncritique of Hegelian Idealism, which influenced Kierkegaard, Marx,\nNietzsche, Heidegger, and others, and aspects of which are echoed by\nthinkers like T.W. Adorno and Jacques Derrida. Schelling\u2019s focus\non humankind\u2019s relationship to nature has gained particular\nrelevance as the seriousness of the climate emergency has become fully\napparent in recent years.\n",
