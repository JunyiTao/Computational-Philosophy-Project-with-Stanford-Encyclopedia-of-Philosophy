But how do they persist through time?\nAccording to some philosophers, things have temporal parts as well as\nspatial parts: accepting this is supposed to help us solve a whole\nbunch of metaphysical problems, and keep our philosophy in line with\nmodern physics. Other philosophers disagree, arguing that neither\nmetaphysics nor physics give us good reason to believe in temporal\nparts. \n",
