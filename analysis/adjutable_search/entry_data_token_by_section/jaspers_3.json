    "main_text": "The Philosophical Writings\n4. The Philosophical Writings\n\nJaspers\u2019s first intervention in philosophical debate,\nPsychology of World Views, constructed a typology of mental\nattitudes, which, close to Weber\u2019s model of ideal types, was\nintended to provide an interpretive account of basic psychological\ndispositions. The underlying argument in this work is that the\nconstitutive fact of human mental life is the division between subject\nand object (Subjekt-Objekt-Spaltung). Human psychological\nforms\u2014or world views\u2014are positioned as antinomical moments\nwithin this founding antinomy, and they give distinct paradigmatic\nexpression to the relation between human subjective inclinations and\nfreedoms and the objective phenomena which the subject encounters.\nUnlike Weber, however, Jaspers argued that the construction of world\nviews is not a merely neutral process, to be judged in non-evaluative\nmanner. Instead, all world views contain an element of pathology; they\nincorporate strategies of defensiveness, suppression and subterfuge,\nand they are concentrated around false certainties or spuriously\nobjectivized modes of rationality, into which the human mind withdraws\nin order to obtain security amongst the frighteningly limitless\npossibilities of human existence. World views, in consequence,\ncommonly take the form of objectivized cages (Geh\u00e4use),\nin which existence hardens itself against contents and experiences\nwhich threaten to transcend or unbalance the defensive restrictions\nwhich it has placed upon its operations. Although some world views\npossess an unconditioned component, most world views exist as the\nlimits of a formed mental apparatus. It is the task of\npsychological intervention, Jaspers thus argued, to guide human\nexistence beyond the restricted antinomies around which it stabilizes\nitself, and to allow it decisively to confront the more authentic\npossibilities, of subjective and objective life, which it effaces\nthrough its normal rational dispositions and attitudes.\n\nIn addition to this psychological typology, Jaspers\u2019s analysis\nof world views also contains a wider critique of human rationality.\nMost modes of rationality, he suggested, are conveniently instrumental\nor ideological forms, which serve distinct subjective and objective\nfunctions, and they habitually stand in the way of genuine knowledge.\nAt the same time, however, he also claimed that rationality possesses\ncapacities of communicative integrity and phenomenological\nself-overcoming, and, if authentically exercised, it is able to escape\nits narrowly functional form, to expose itself to new contents beyond\nits limits and antinomies, and to elaborate new and more cognitively\nunified conceptual structures. He therefore indicated that\nformal-epistemological concepts of rationality must be expanded to\nrecognize that experience and committed actions are formative of\nauthentic knowledge, and that reason cannot, in Cartesian manner, be\nmonadically dislocated from its historical, sensory, experiential and\nvoluntaristic foundations. From the outset, therefore, Jaspers\u2019s\nwork, although methodologically marked by Weber, was also indelibly\nstamped by Hegel\u2019s philosophy, and it sought to integrate the\npreconditions of Hegel\u2019s phenomenology into a systematic\npsychological doctrine. Indeed, at this early stage in his development\nJaspers\u2019s thought hinged on an existential\u2014or\nKierkegaardian\u2014alteration of Hegelian philosophy. In this, he\ntransposed the dialectical process through which Hegel accounted for\nthe overcoming of cognitive antinomies in the emergence of\nself-consciousness into an analysis of cognitive formation which sees\nthe resolution of reason\u2019s antinomies as effected through vital\nexperiences, decisive acts of self-confrontation, or communicative\ntranscendence.\n\nIn this early work, Jaspers introduced several concepts which assumed\ngreat importance for all his work. Most importantly, this work\ncontains a theory of the limit (Grenze). This term designates\nboth the habitual forms and attitudes of the human mental apparatus,\nand the experiences of the mind as it recognizes these attitudes as\nfalsely objectivized moments within its antinomical structure, and as\nit transcends these limits by disposing itself in new ways towards\nitself and its objects. In his early philosophy Jaspers thus ascribed\ncentral status to \u2018limit situations\u2019\n(Grenzsituationen). Limit situations are moments, usually\naccompanied by experiences of dread, guilt or acute anxiety, in which\nthe human mind confronts the restrictions and pathological narrowness\nof its existing forms, and allows itself to abandon the securities of\nits limitedness, and so to enter new realm of self-consciousness. In\nconjunction with this, then, this work also contains a theory of the\nunconditioned (das Unbedingte). In this theory,\nJaspers argued that limit situations are unconditioned moments of\nhuman existence, in which reason is drawn by intense impulses or\nimperatives, which impel it to expose itself to the limits of its\nconsciousness and to seek higher or more reflected modes of knowledge.\nThe unconditioned, a term transported from Kantian doctrines of\nsynthetic regress, is thus proposed by Jaspers as a vital impetus in\nreason, in which reason encounters its form as conditioned or limited\nand desires to transcend the limits of this form. In relation to this,\nthen, Jaspers\u2019s early psychological work also introduced, albeit\ninchoately, the concept of existential communication. In\nthis, he argued that the freedom of consciousness to overcome its\nlimits and antinomies can only be elaborated through speech: that is,\nas a process in which consciousness is elevated beyond its limits\nthrough intensely engaged communication with other persons, and in\nwhich committed communication helps to suspend the prejudices and\nfixed attitudes of consciousness. Existentially open consciousness is\ntherefore always communicative, and it is only where it abandons its\nmonological structure that consciousness can fully elaborate its\nexistential possibilities. In this early doctrine of communication,\nJaspers helped to shape a wider communicative and intersubjective\nshift in German philosophy; indeed, the resonances of his existential\nhermeneutics remained palpable in the much later works of Hans-Georg\nGadamer and Paul Ricoeur. Less obviously, however, in this doctrine he\nalso guided early existential thinking away from its original\nassociation with Kierkegaard and Nietzsche and, although assimilating\nKierkegaardian elements of decisiveness and impassioned commitment, he\nclaimed that Kierkegaard\u2019s cult of interiority, centred in the\nspeechlessness of inner life, was a miscarried attempt to envision the\nconditions of human authenticity. The decision for authentic\nself-overcoming and cognitive unity can only occur, he argued, through\nshared participation in dialogue.\n\nThe major publication of Jaspers\u2019s earlier period, and probably\nof his entire career, is the three-volume work: Philosophy\n(1932). In this work, he retained the partly Hegelian focus of his\nearlier publications, and he followed the spirit of Hegelian\nphenomenology in providing an account of the formation of human\nconsciousness, which grasps consciousness as proceeding from the level\nof immediate knowledge and progressing through a sequence of\nantinomies towards a level of truthfully unified reflection and\nself-knowledge. In this, Jaspers again accentuated the claim that the\nantinomies which reason encounters and resolves in its unfolding as\ntruth are at once both cognitive and experiential antinomies, and that\nthe lived moments of human existence are always of cognitively\nconstitutive relevance for the formation of consciousness. These ideas\nin fact remained central to Jaspers\u2019s philosophy throughout its\nsubsequent evolution. In his later philosophical works, especially\nVon der Wahrheit (Of Truth, 1947), he continued to\ngive prominence to cognitive models derived from Hegelian\nphenomenology, and he proposed a concept of the encompassing\n(das Umgreifende) to determine the phenomenological\ngradations of thought and being. However, in addition to its concern\nwith Hegelian themes, Philosophy also contains a fundamental\nreconstruction of Kantian themes, it has its foundation in a critical\nreconstruction of Kant\u2019s doctrine of transcendental ideas, and\nit is built around an endeavour to explain the elements of Kantian\nidealism as a systematic doctrine of subjective-metaphysical\nexperience.\n\nThe three volumes of Philosophy bear the titles\nPhilosophical World Orientation (volume I), The\nIllumination of Existence (volume II), and Metaphysics\n(volume III). It was written during the 1920s after Jaspers obtained\nthe full professorship at Heidelberg University. Each volume of this\nbook thus describes a particular way of being: orientation,\nexistence and metaphysical transcendence are the\nthree essential existential modalities of human life. At the same\ntime, each volume also describes a particular way of knowing, which is\ncorrelated with a way of being: orientation is cognitively determined\nby objectively verifiable knowledge or by positive or scientific\nproof-forms, existence is determined by subjective/existential\nself-reflection, and transcendence is determined by the symbolic\ninterpretation of metaphysical contents. Together, the three volumes\nof Philosophy are designed to show how human existence and\nhuman knowledge necessarily progress from one level of being and one\nlevel of knowledge to another, and how consciousness gradually\nevolves, through confrontation with its own antinomies, from an\nimmediate and unformed state towards a condition of unity and integral\nself-experience. The three volumes are consequently bound together by\nthe argument that at the level of immediate objective\nknowledge\u2014of orientation in the world\u2014human consciousness\nraises subjective-existential questions about itself and the grounds\nof its truth which it cannot resolve at this level of consciousness,\nand it encounters antinomies which call it to reflect existentially\nupon itself and to elevate it to the level of existence or\nexistentially committed self-reflection. At this higher level of\nconsciousness, then, existence raises metaphysical questions about\nitself and its origin which it cannot begin to answer without an\nawareness that existence is, at an originary or authentic level,\ntranscendent, and that its truth is metaphysical.\n\nEach level of being in Jaspers\u2019s Philosophy corresponds\nto one of the Kantian transcendental ideas, and the modes of thinking\nand knowing defining each level of existence elucidate the\nintellectual content of Kant\u2019s ideas. The level of orientation\nin the world corresponds to the idea of the unity of the world; the\nlevel of existence corresponds to the idea of the soul\u2019s\nimmortality; the level of transcendence corresponds to the idea of\nGod\u2019s necessary existence. However, whereas Kant saw\ntranscendental ideas as the formal-regulative ideas of reason,\nserving, at most, to confer systematic organization on reason\u2019s\nimmanent operations, Jaspers viewed transcendental ideas as realms of\nlived knowledge, through which consciousness passes and by whose\nexperienced antinomies it is formed and guided to a knowledge of\nitself as transcendent. Jaspers thus attributed to\ntranscendental ideas a substantial and experiential content. Ideas do\nnot, as for Kant, simply mark the formal limits of knowledge, marking\nout the bounds of sense against speculative or metaphysical questions.\nInstead, ideas provide a constant impulsion for reason to overcome its\nlimits, and to seek an ever more transcendent knowledge of itself, its\ncontents and its possibilities. In his mature philosophy, therefore,\nJaspers transformed the Kantian transcendental ideas into ideas of\ntranscendence, in which consciousness apprehends and elaborates\nthe possibility of substantial or metaphysical knowledge and\nself-knowledge. Central to this adjustment to Kant\u2019s conception\nof ideas was also an implied, yet quite fundamental critique of the\nkey Kantian distinction between the transcendent and the\ntranscendental. In contrast to contemporary neo-Kantian readings of\nKant, which were prepared to acknowledge the ideal element in Kantian\nidealism only, at most, as a regulative framework, generated by\nreason\u2019s own autonomous functions, Jaspers argued that Kantian\nphilosophy always at once contains and suppresses a vision of\nexperienced transcendence, and that the Kantian ideas should be viewed\nas challenges to reason to think beyond the limits of its autonomy,\ntowards new and more authentic contents, self-experiences and\nfreedoms.\n\nIn replacing the transcendental with the transcendent, however,\nJaspers did not argue that transcendent contents are obtainable as\npositive elements of human knowledge. On the contrary, he argued that\nconsciousness only acquires knowledge of its transcendence by\ncontemplating the evanescent ciphers of transcendence, which\nsignify the absolute limits of human consciousness. These ciphers\nmight be encountered in nature, in art, in religious symbolism, or in\nmetaphysical philosophy. But it is characteristic of all ciphers that,\nin alluding to transcendence, they also withhold transcendent\nknowledge from consciousness, and that they can only act as indices of\nthe impossibility of such knowledge. The attitude of consciousness\nwhich apprehends its limits and its possible transcendence can\ntherefore only be an attitude of foundering or failing\n(Scheitern), and transcendence can intrude in human\nconsciousness only as an experience of the absolute insufficiency of\nthis consciousness for interpreting its originary or metaphysical\ncharacter. At this level, then, although opposing the formality and\nexperiential vacuity of neo-Kantianism, Jaspers also accepted the\noriginal Kantian prohibition on positive transcendent or metaphysical\nknowledge. He argued that consciousness always has a metaphysical\norientation to be other than, or transcendent to, its existing forms,\nbut he also claimed that this orientation can only factually culminate\nin a crisis of transcendence, or in a crisis of metaphysics. Although\nreconsolidating the metaphysical aspects of Kantian philosophy,\ntherefore, Jaspers\u2019s own metaphysics is always a post-Kantian\nmetaphysics: it is a negative metaphysics, which resists all\nsuggestion that human reason might give itself an account of\nmetaphysical essences, which defines the realm of human meaning as\nformed by its difference against positive metaphysical knowledge, but\nwhich nonetheless sees reason, in Kierkegaardian manner, as driven by\na despairing desire for metaphysical transcendence.\n\nJaspers\u2019s metaphysical reconstruction of Kantian idealism has\nbeen denounced by other philosophers, most notably those in the broad\nmilieu of the Frankfurt School, as a stage in a wider course of\ncognitive degeneration, which falsely translates absolute metaphysical\ncontents into moments of human inner experience. Despite this, there\nare good grounds for arguing that Jaspers\u2019s metaphysics is an\nimportant critique of the fully autonomist accounts of rationality\nproposed by neo-Kantianism, and it even coincides with the critiques\nof Kantian formalism which underpinned the philosophies widely\nassociated with the Frankfurt School. Jaspers intuited that Kantian\ntranscendentalism suppressed a deep-lying impulse for transcendence,\nand this aspect of Kant\u2019s thought was badly neglected by\ninterpreters who saw Kant\u2019s philosophy as a doctrine of pure\nimmanence or autonomy. Adorno\u2019s later argument that Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism always contains a lament over the closure of\nreason against transcendence was thus anticipated by Jaspers, albeit\nin subjectivist terms, and Jaspers and Adorno\u2014for all their\npolitical differences\u2014can be placed close together as thinkers\nwho endeavoured to revitalize the metaphysical traces in idealism. In\nany case, Jaspers\u2019s insistence, contra Kant and the\nneo-Kantians, that reason itself is not the sole source of knowledge,\nand that the task of reason is not proscriptively to circumscribe the\nsphere of its validity against transcendence, but to overcome its\ncognitive limits and to envision contents which cannot be generated by\nits own autonomous functions, deserves to be rehabilitated as an\nabidingly significant contribution to modern debates on metaphysics\nand epistemology.\n",
