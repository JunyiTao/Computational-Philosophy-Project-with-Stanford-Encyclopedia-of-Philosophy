    "main_text": "The Early-Scholastic Tradition || Stephen Langton: Synderesis and its Properties\n2.2 Stephen Langton: Synderesis and its Properties\n\nStephen Langton (1155\u20131228), regent master of theology at Paris\nand later Archbishop of Canterbury, is important in the present\ncontext less for any systematic treatment of conscience\u2014indeed\nStephen scarcely touches on the issue at all\u2014than for his\nsomewhat scattered views on synderesis. The relevant treatment comes\nin Stephen\u2019s Quaestiones disputatae of 1203\u20131205\nin the context of his discussion on free decision (liberum\narbitrium).\n\nFor Stephen, there are three powers (vires) of the soul that\nare relevant to the moral life: the concupiscible appetite, reason and\nsynderesis. The concupiscible appetite draws reason towards what is\nbad\u2014specifically towards the sin of sensuality\u2014while\nsynderesis attempts to sway it towards the good. It is reason\u2019s\njob to adjudicate between these two impulses. Freedom of decision\n(libertas arbitrii) is the outcome of reason directing the\nwill to choose in accordance with either the promptings of sensuality,\nor the promptings of synderesis (Stephen Langton, Quaestiones\ndisputatae; Lottin ed. Psychologie et morale I, 1942:\n61).\n\nThe purpose of synderesis, then, is to direct reason away from vice\nfor it is the faculty \u201cby which a person naturally detests what\nis evil and is a part of the rational power\u201d (Quaestiones\ndisputatae; Lottin ed. Psychology et morale II.1, 1948:\n112). Can such a power be extinguished? Yes and no. In its capacity as\nan inclination towards the good, which is accidental to it, synderesis\ncan indeed be lost in the damned. Essentially speaking, however, the\npurpose of synderesis is to repudiate what is wicked. In this sense,\nit is never lost, even in the damned (Quaestiones disputatae;\nLottin ed. 1948: 111).\n\nStephen Langton\u2019s most important contribution to the development\nof the concept of synderesis occurs in his discussion of whether\nsynderesis can merit or demerit. In the process of discussing this\nissue Stephen links synderesis to the practical syllogism,\nspecifically associating it with the grasp of general principles\n(Quaestiones disputatae; Lottin ed. 1948: 113). D\u2019Arcy\nsums up Langton\u2019s position as follows:\n\n\nRemorse of conscience is the work, not of synderesis, but of reason,\nfor synderesis remains at the level of general principles, whereas\nreason descends to the concrete case; but it is precisely over the\nconcrete case that remorse of conscience is felt; hence it is by\nreason, and not by synderesis, that we sin. (D\u2019Arcy 1961:\n23\u201324)\n\n\nLangton\u2019s association of synderesis with general moral\nprinciples would, as we will see, influence later thinkers such as\nAquinas.\n",
