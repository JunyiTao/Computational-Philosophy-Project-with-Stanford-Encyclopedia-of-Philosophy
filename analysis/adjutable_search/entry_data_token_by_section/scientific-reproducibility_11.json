    "main_text": "Epistemological Issues Related to Replication || The Experimenters\u2019 Regress\n3.1 The Experimenters\u2019 Regress\n\nCollins (1985) articulated a widely discussed problem that is now\nknown as the experimenters\u2019 regress. He initially lays\nout the problem in the context of measurement (Collins 1985: 84).\nSuppose a scientist is trying to determine the accuracy of a\nmeasurement device and also the accuracy of a measurement result.\nPerhaps, for example, a scientist is using a thermometer to measure\nthe temperature of a liquid, and it delivers a particular measurement\nresult, say, 12 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe problem arises because of the interdependence of the accuracy of\nthe measurement result and the accuracy of the measurement device: to\nknow whether a particular measurement result is accurate, we need to\ntest it against a measurement result that is previously known to be\naccurate, but to know that the result is accurate, we need to know\nthat it has been obtained via an accurate measuring device, and so on.\nThis, according to Collins, creates a \u201ccircle\u201d which he\nrefers to as the \u201cexperimenters\u2019 regress\u201d.\n\nCollins extends the problem to scientific replication more generally.\nSuppose that an experiment B is a replication study of an\ninitial experiment A, and that B\u2019s result\napparently conflicts with A\u2019s result. This seeming\nconflict may have one of two interpretations:\n\nThe results of A and B deliver genuinely conflicting\nverdicts over the truth of the hypothesis under investigation\n Experiment B was not in fact a proper replication of\nexperiment A.\n\n\nThe regress poses a problem about how to choose between these\ninterpretations, a problem which threatens the epistemic value of\nreplication studies if there are no rational grounds for choosing in a\nparticular way. Determining whether one experiment is a proper\nreplication of another is complicated by the facts that scientific\nwriting conventions often omit precise details of experimental\nmethodology (Collins 2016), and, furthermore, much of the knowledge\nthat scientists require to execute experiments is tacit and\n\u201ccannot be fully explicated or absolutely established\u201d\n(Collins 1985: 73).\n\nIn the context of experimental methodology, Collins wrote:\n\n\nTo know an experiment has been well conducted, one needs to know\nwhether it gives rise to the correct outcome. But to know what the\ncorrect outcome is, one needs to do a well-conducted experiment. But\nto know whether the experiment has been well conducted\u2026! (2016:\n66; ellipses original)\n\n\nCollins holds that in such cases where a conflict of results arises,\nscientists tend to fraction into two groups, each holding opposing\ninterpretations of the results. According to Collins, where such\ngroups are \u201cdetermined\u201d and the \u201ccontroversy runs\ndeep\u201d (Collins 2016: 67), the dispute between the groups cannot\nbe resolved via further experimentation, for each additional result is\nsubject to the problem posed by the experimenters\u2019\n regress.[2]\n In such cases, Collins claims that particular non-epistemic factors\nwill partly determine which interpretation becomes the lasting view:\n\n\n\nthe career, social, and cognitive interests of the scientists, their\nreputations and that of their institutions, and the perceived utility\nfor future work. (Franklin & Collins 2016: 99)\n\n\nFranklin was the most vociferous opponent of Collins, although recent\ncollaboration between the two has fostered some agreement (Collins\n2016). Franklin presented a set of strategies for validating\nexperimental results, all of which relate to \u201crational\nargument\u201d on epistemic grounds (Franklin 1989: 459; 1994).\nExamples include, for instance, appealing to experimental checks on\nmeasurement devices or eliminating potential sources of error in the\nexperiment (Franklin & Collins 2016). He claimed that the fact\nthat such strategies were evidenced in scientific practice\n\u201cargues against those who believe that rational arguments plays\nlittle, if any, role\u201d in such validation (Franklin 1989: 459),\nwith Collins being an example. He interprets Collins as suggesting\nthat the strategies for resolving debates of the validation of results\nare social factors or \u201cculturally accepted practices\u201d\n(Franklin, 1989: 459) which do not provide reasons to underpin\nrational belief about results. Franklin (1994) further claims that\nCollins conflates the difficulty in successfully executing\nexperiments with the difficulty of demonstrating that\nexperiments have been executed, with Feest (2016) interpreting him to\nsay that although such execution requires tacit knowledge, one can\nnevertheless appeal to strategies to demonstrate the validity of\nexperimental findings.\n\nFeest (2016) examines a case study involving debates about the Mozart\neffect in psychology (which, roughly speaking, is the effect whereby\nlistening to Mozart beneficially affects some aspect of intelligence\nor brain structure). Like Collins, she agrees that there is a problem\nin determining whether conflicting results suggest a putative\nreplication experiment is not a proper replication attempt, in part\nbecause there is uncertainty about whether scientific concepts such as\nthe Mozart effect have been appropriately operationalised in earlier\nor later experimental contexts. Unlike Collins (on her\ninterpretation), however, she does not think that this uncertainty\narises because scientists have inescapably tacit knowledge of the\nlinguistic rules about the meaning and application of concepts like\nthe Mozart effect. Rather the uncertainty arises because such concepts\nare still themselves developing and because of assumptions about the\nworld that are required to successfully draw inferences from\nit. Experimental methodology then serves to reveal the previously\ntacit assumptions about the application of concepts and the legitimacy\nof inferences, assumptions which are then susceptible to scrutiny.\n\nFor example, in her study of the Mozart effect, she notes that\nreplication studies of the Mozart effect failed to find that Mozart\nmusic had a beneficial influence on spatial abilities. Rauscher, who\nwas the first to report results supporting the Mozart effect,\nsuggested that the later studies were not proper replications of her\nstudy (Rauscher, Shaw, and Ky 1993, 1995). She clarified that the\nMozart effect applied only to a particular category\nof spatial abilities (spatio-temporal processes) and that the later\nstudies operationalised the Mozart effect in terms of different\nspatial abilities (spatial recognition). Here, then, there was a\ndifficulty in determining whether to interpret failed replication\nresults as evidence against the initial results or rather as an\nindication that the replication studies were not proper replications.\nFeest claims this difficulty arose because of tacit knowledge or\nassumptions: assumptions about the application of the Mozart effect\nconcept to different kinds of spatial abilities, about whether the\nworld is such that Mozart music has an effect on such abilities and\nabout whether the failure of Mozart to impact other kinds of spatial\nabilities warrants the inference that the Mozart effect does not\nexist. Contra Collins, however, experimental methodology enabled the\nexplication and testing of these assumptions, thus allowing scientists\nto overcome the interpretive impasse.\n\nAgainst this background, her overall argument is that scientists often\nare and should be sceptical towards each other\u2019s results.\nHowever, this is not because of inescapably tacit knowledge and the\ninevitable failure of epistemic strategies for validating results.\nRather, it is at least in part because of varying tacit assumptions\nthat researchers have about the meaning of concepts, about the world\nand about what to draw inferences from it. Progressive experimentation\nserves to reveal these tacit assumptions which can then be\nscrutinised, leading to the accumulation of knowledge.\n\nThere is also other philosophical literature on the\nexperimenters\u2019 regress, including Teira\u2019s (2013) paper\narguing that particular experimental debiasing procedures are\ndefensible against the regress from a contractualist perspective,\naccording to which self-interested scientists have reason to adopt\ngood methodological standards.\n",
