    "main_text": "Psychology || The human soul\n4.1 The human soul\n\n\nWe have two works by al-Kindi devoted to the ontology of the human\nsoul: That There are Incorporeal Substances and Discourse\non the Soul. The two depend on very different Greek sources, and\nare very different in rhetorical presentation. But the doctrine that\nemerges from them is not necessarily inconsistent.\n\nThat There are Incorporeal Substances (Abu Rida 1950,\n265\u201369, Adamson and Pormann 2009) is a creative application of\nideas from Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories to the problem of showing that the human soul is\nan immaterial substance. Al-Kindi takes up this task in stages, first\nproving that the soul is a substance, then showing that it is\nimmaterial. He argues that the soul is a substance by drawing on the\nopening chapters of the Categories to claim that the essence\nof something shares a name and definition with that thing. Since the\nsoul is the essence of the living being, and the living being is a\nsubstance, the soul is also a substance. Furthermore, it is an\nimmaterial substance: for the soul is \u201cthe intellectual form of\nthe living thing,\u201d and an intellectual form is a species. But\nspecies, al-Kindi argues, are immaterial; therefore the soul is\nimmaterial. Among the problematic moves in this train of argument is\nthe identification of the human soul with the species of human. This\nwould seem to be al-Kindi\u2019s attempt to bring together the idea of\nspecies, which is a \u201csecondary substance\u201d in the\nCategories, with the doctrine of form found in such works as\nthe De Anima and Metaphysics. Al-Kindi simply\nconflates the two, without argument \u2013 he does not address the\nobvious question of how there can be many human souls, all of which\nare identical with the single species human.\n\n\nApart from brief opening and closing remarks, Discourse on the\nSoul (Abu Rida 1950, 272\u201380; also D\u2019Ancona 1996,\nGenequand 1987, Jolivet 1996) consists entirely of supposed quotes\nfrom Greek authorities \u2013 Plato, Pythagoras, and Aristotle\n\u2013 about the nature of the soul. The actual sources used are\nunclear, though the Republic is the ultimate source for a\nsection describing Plato\u2019s tripartite soul. The section on Aristotle\nis a fable about a Greek king, and has nothing to do with any extant\nAristotelian work. The tenor of these remarks is hortatory, ascetic\nand even visionary: our task is to cleanse our souls from the\n\u201cstains\u201d that adhere to it from the body, and to ascend\nthrough the heavenly spheres, ultimately to the \u201cworld of the\nintellect\u201d where it will reside in \u201cthe light of the\nCreator.\u201d The soul in question here would seem to be the\nrational soul: the lower parts of Plato\u2019s tripartite soul (the\nirascible and concupiscent parts) are described as faculties seated in\nthe body.  The point of this psychological doxography is not unlike\nthat of Incorporeal Substances: the soul is a \u201csimple\nsubstance,\u201d separate from body. Indeed this is presented as the\noverall message of the treatise in al-Kindi\u2019s closing remarks.\n",
