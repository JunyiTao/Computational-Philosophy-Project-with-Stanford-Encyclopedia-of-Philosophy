    "main_text": "The Critique of Scientism\n2. The Critique of Scientism\n\n\nWittgenstein turns to the idea of a science of aesthetics, an idea for\nwhich he has precious little sympathy (\u201calmost too ridiculous\nfor words\u201d [Wittgenstein 1966, 11]).  But as is often the case\nin Wittgenstein's philosophical work, it does not follow from\nthis scornful or dismissive attitude that he has no interest in the\netiology of the idea, or in excavating the hidden steps or components\nof thought that have led some to this idea. In the ensuing discussion\nhe unearths a picture of causation that under-girds the very idea of a\nscientific explanation of aesthetic judgment or preference. And in\nworking underground in this way, he reveals the analogies to cases of\ngenuine scientific explanation, where the \u201ctracing of a\nmechanism\u201d just is the process of giving a causal account, i.e.\nwhere the observed effect is described as the inevitable result of\nprior links in the causal chain leading to it. If, to take his\nexample, an architect designs a door and we find ourselves in a state\nof discontentment because the door, within the larger design of the\nfa\u00e7ade (within its stylistic \u201clanguage-game\u201d, we\nmight say), is too low, we are liable to describe this on the model of\nscientific explanation. Then, we make a substantive of the discontent,\nsee it as the causal result of the lowness of the door, and in\nidentifying the lowness as the cause, think ourselves able to dislodge\nthe inner entity, the discontent, by raising the door. But this\nmischaracterizes our aesthetic reactions, or what we might call, by\nanalogy to moral psychology, our aesthetic psychology.\n",
