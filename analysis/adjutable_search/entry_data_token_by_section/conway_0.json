    "main_text": "Life\n1. Life\n\nLady Anne Conway (n\u00e9e Finch) (1631\u20131679) was the\nposthumous daughter of Sir Heneage Finch and his second wife Elizabeth\nCradock, widow of Sir John Bennet. She was born in London in 1631, and\nraised in the house now known as Kensington Palace, which then\nbelonged to the Finch family. The youngest child in a large family,\nshe was especially close to her half-brother, John Finch. Nothing is\nknown of her education, though she was clearly well-read by the time\nshe made the acquaintance of one of the\n Cambridge Platonists (see entry),\n Henry More (1614\u20131687). Of Anne Conway\u2019s remarkable\nphilosophical education, much more is known. Thanks to her brother,\nwho was his pupil at Christ\u2019s College, University of Cambridge, More\nagreed to give her instruction in philosophy. Since, as a woman, she\nwas debarred from attending the university, he instructed her by\nletter. The few letters that survive from this early correspondence\nindicate that Cartesianism formed the basis of the course of\ninstruction she followed. Thereafter, Anne Conway and More remained\nfriends for the rest of her life. By this means she had a permanent\nlink to intellectual life beyond the confines of her domestic\nsituation.\n\nIn 1651 Anne Conway married Edward, third Viscount Conway, who was\nheir to estates in Warwickshire and County Antrim in Ireland. Their\none child, Heneage, died in infancy. The Conway family possessed one\nof the finest private libraries of the period, and her husband appears\nto have encouraged his wife\u2019s intellectual interests. However, from\nher teens she suffered from periodic bouts of illness, which became\nmore acute and more frequent as she got older. It was as a result of a\nsearch for relief from this that she came into contact with the\nFlemish physician and philosopher, Francis Mercury van Helmont, son of\nthe iatrochemist, Jan Baptiste van Helmont. During the last decade of\nher life, the younger Van Helmont lived in her household. It was\nthrough Van Helmont that Anne Conway was introduced to kabbalistic\nthought and to Quakerism. These encounters resulted in radical new\ndepartures for her: on the one hand, her study of the Jewish kabbalah\ncontributed to her decisive break with the Cartesianism of her\nphilosophical upbringing; on the other hand, her encounter with Van\nHelmont\u2019s Quaker friends led to her conversion to Quakerism, shortly\nbefore she died in 1679.\n",
