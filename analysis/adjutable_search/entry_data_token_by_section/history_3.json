We might\nput these concepts into a crude map by saying that \"history\" is an\norganized and evidence-based presentation of of the processes,\nactions, and events that have occurred for a people over an extended\nperiod of time; \"memory\" is the personal recollections and\nrepresentations of individuals who lived through a series of events\nand processes; and \"narratives\" are the stories that ordinary people\nand historians weave together to make sense of the events and\nhappenings through which a people and a person have lived. Collective\nmemory, the idea that groups such as Welsh miners, Serbian villagers,\nor black Alabama farmers possess a collective representation of the\npast that binds them together, can be understood as a shared set of\nnarratives and stories about the past events of the given group or\ncommunity. We use narratives to make sense of things that have\nhappened; to identify meanings and causes within this series of\nevents; and to select the \"important\" events and processes out from\nthe ordinary and inconsequential.\n\nWhat is a narrative? Most generally, it is an account of how and why a\nsituation or event came to be. A narrative is intended to provide an\naccount of how a complex historical event unfolded and why. We want to\nunderstand the event in time. What were the contextual features that\nwere relevant to the outcome\u2014the conditions at one or more\npoints in time that played a role? What were the actions and choices\nthat agents performed, and why did they take these actions rather than\nother possible choices? What causal processes\u2014either social or\nnatural\u2014may have played a role in influencing the outcome? So a\nnarrative seeks to provide hermeneutic understanding of the\noutcome\u2014why did actors behave as they did in bringing about the\noutcome?\u2014and causal explanation\u2014what social and\nnatural processes were acting behind the backs of the actors in\nbringing about the outcome? And different narratives represent\ndifferent mixes of hermeneutic and causal factors. A crucial and\nunavoidable feature of narrative history is the fact of selectivity.\nThe narrative historian is forced to make choices and selections at\nevery stage: between \"significant\" and \"insignificant\", between\n\"sideshow\" and \"main event\", and between levels of description.\n\nIt is evident that there are often multiple truthful, unbiased, and\ninconsistent narratives that can be told for a single complex event.\nExactly because many things happened at once, actors\u2019 motives\nwere ambiguous, and the causal connections among events are debatable,\nit is possible to construct inconsistent narratives that are equally\nwell supported by the evidence. Further, the intellectual interest\nthat different historians bring to the happening can lead to\ndifferences in the narrative. One historian may be primarily\ninterested in the role that different views of social justice played\nin the actions of the participants; another may be primarily\ninterested in the role that social networks played; and a third may be\nespecially interested in the role of charismatic personalities, with a\nconsequent structuring to the narrative around the actions and\nspeeches of the charismatic leader. Each of these may be truthful,\nobjective, and unbiased\u2014and inconsistent in important ways with\nthe others. So narratives are underdetermined by the facts, and there\nis no such thing as an exhaustive and comprehensive telling of the\nstory\u2014only various tellings that emphasize one set of themes or\nanother.\n\nWhen we consider collective memory and social identity, we are also\nforced to recognize that powerful institutions attempt to shape the\nnarrative of important events in ways that serve political interests.\nA group identity can be defined as a set of beliefs and stories about\none\u2019s home, one\u2019s people, and one\u2019s past. These\nideas often involve answers to questions like these: Where did we come\nfrom? How did we get here? And perhaps, who are my enemies? So an\nidentity involves a narrative, a creation story, or perhaps a\nremembrance of a long chain of disasters and crimes. Identity and\ncollective memory are intertwined; monuments, songs, icons, and flags\nhelp to set the way points in the history of a people and the\ncollective emotions that this group experiences. They have to do with\nthe stories we tell each other about who we are; how our histories\nbrought us to this place; and what large events shaped us as a\n\"people\". Governments, leaders, activists, and political parties all\nhave an interest in shaping collective memory to their own ends.\nCollective memories and identities are interwoven with myths and folk\nhistories. And, as Benedict Anderson (1983) demonstrated, these\nstories are more often than not fictions of various kinds, promulgated\nby individuals and groups who have an interest in shaping collective\nconsciousness in one way or another.\n\nThe philosophy of history must pay attention to the nexus of\nexperience, memory, and history. There is no single \u201cCivil\nRights era\u201d experience or \u201cGreat Depression\u201d\nexperience; instead, historians must consider a wide range of sources\nand evidence, including oral histories, first-person accounts,\nphotographs, and other traces of the human experience of the time to\nallow them to discern both variation and some degree of\nthematicization of memory and identity in the periods they study.\nSecond, attention to history and memory highlights the amount of human\nand individual agency involved in memory. Memories must be created;\nagents must find frameworks within which to understand their moments\nof historical experience. Museums and monuments curate historical\nmemories \u2014 often with biases of their own. A third and equally\nimportant point is the fact that memories become part of the political\nmobilization possibilities that exist for a group. Groups find their\ncollective identities through shared understandings of the past; and\nthese shared understandings provide a basis for future collective\naction. Paul Ricoeur\u2019s\u00a0Time and Narrative\n(1984-1988) sheds profound light on the\u00a0profound relations that\nextend among memory, identity, narrative, and history.\n",
