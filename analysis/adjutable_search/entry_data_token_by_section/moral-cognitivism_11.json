    "main_text": "Motivations for Non-cognitivism || The Open Question Argument\n3.1 The Open Question Argument\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th Century, G. E. Moore\u2019s open\nquestion argument convinced many philosophers that moral statements\nwere not equivalent to statements made using non-moral or descriptive\nterms. For any non-moral description of an action or object it seemed\nthat competent speakers could without confusion doubt that the action\nor object was appropriately characterized using a moral term such as\n\u2018good\u2019 or \u2018right\u2019. The question of whether the\naction or object so described was good or right was always open, even\nto competent speakers. Furthermore, in the absence of any systematic\ntheory to explain the possibility of synthetic as opposed to analytic\nidentity claims, many were convinced that this showed that moral\nproperties could not be identified with any natural (or supernatural)\nproperties. Thus Moore and others concluded that moral properties such\nas goodness were irreducible sui generis properties, not identical to\nnatural properties (Moore 1903, 15).\n\nThe non-naturalists, however, had neglected another option consistent\nwith the thought underlying the open question argument. Perhaps moral\npredicates did not refer to properties at all, and perhaps their\nmeaning was not analyzable in non-moral descriptive terms not because\nthey referred to irreducibly moral properties but because, despite\nappearances, they were not referring expressions at all. In other\nwords, semantic nonfactualism about moral terms entails that questions\nof the sort highlighted by Moore could not be closed by any amount of\ncompetence with the expressions used to ask them because the\nexpressions in question are not in fact equivalent. Thus\nnon-cognitivists could argue that moral expressions used in such open\nquestions did not function to represent anything or to predicate any\nproperty and as such were not equivalent to any descriptive or\nreferring expressions. Rather they merely served to convey emotion\n(Ogden and Richards 1923, 125). Speakers to whom such questions seemed\nopen were tacitly aware of this difference in function and hence not\nin a position to equate moral expressions with descriptive\nexpressions.\n\nContemporary philosophers recognize the possibility that sentences\nthat express identities might be synthetic as opposed to analytic or\ntrue by definition. We can discover that water is the same stuff as\nH2O without being able to infer it from the meanings of the\nterms involved (Kripke 1972; Putnam 1975a). And descriptive\nnaturalists about morality have pointed out that the openness of\nMoore\u2019s question to competent speakers does not rule out the\npossibility of securing the identity of a moral property with a\nnaturalistic property through empirical discoveries that do not rely\non the expressions in question having the same meaning (Boyd 1988).\nYet many contemporary defenders of non-cognitivism suggest that the\nopen question argument still provides ammunition for their claims.\nEven if we cannot infer from the openness of a question that the\nreferents of two terms used to ask that question are distinct, we\nmight still have reason to think that the two expressions do not mean\nthe same thing. Thus non-cognitivists have used the open question\nargument to suggest that moral terms contain a normative element\ncompletely lacking in descriptive terms and which should be cashed out\nalong the lines that the non-cognitivists favor.\n\nThe open question argument can be seen as providing independent\nsupport for what is sometimes called Hume\u2019s Law \u2013 the\nclaim that one can never validly deduce an \u2018ought\u2019 from an\n\u2018is\u2019 (Hume 1888, 469). According to Hume\u2019s Law, no\nset of premises consisting entirely of non-moral descriptive\nstatements is sufficient to entail a moral or normative conclusion.\nThe non-cognitivist is in a position to explain this, insofar as her\npositive proposal for the functioning of moral terms will suggest they\ndo more than merely describe the world. She will say that moral terms\nessentially express a positive attitude, or function to commend.\nPurely descriptive terms do not. Nothing can be the conclusion of a\nvalid argument which is not already implicit in the premises. Thus\ndescriptive claims cannot entail the extra expressive or imperatival\ncomponent that according to the non-cognitivist is part of the meaning\nof moral terms (Hare 1952, 32\u201349).\n\nThere are of course many ways to resist these arguments. Perhaps moral\nexpressions are analytically equivalent to naturalistic expressions,\nbut these analyticities are themselves not obvious even to competent\nspeakers (Lewis 1989, 129). This may be because no analyticities are\nobvious, or it may be because moral analyses in particular are\nespecially complex. One moral that could be drawn from the history of\nTwentieth Century analytic philosophy is that if there are any\nanalyticities, competent speakers can question them. This is the\nparadox of analysis. If any definition can be questioned by a\ncompetent speaker, and we think there are at least some definitions\nsufficient to underwrite analytic truths, then the mere fact that a\nspeaker can doubt a candidate analysis may not tell against that\nanalysis. An equivalence could be analytic because competent speakers\ntacitly respect it, for the most part acting as if the equivalence is\ntrue (Lewis 1989, 130). It has been suggested that moral concepts are\nrole concepts analogous to the concepts of various mental states as\nconceived by functionalists. The idea is that commonsense morality\nembodies a theory of morality which specifies the ways in which\nvarious moral properties (rightness, wrongness, goodness, badness,\nfairness, etc.) are related to each other and to other properties.\nWhen we put all of the claims of the commonsense theory together it\nspecifies a role that each property must play in terms of the other\nproperties it relates to. The role concept so-specified for each term\nmight then be the concept of the referent of that term (Jackson and\nPettit 1995). If so we should expect such concepts to be quite\ncomplex. And their complexity might make it hard to recognize the\nadequacy of any analysis, even for speakers who tacitly respect the\nequivalence so defined.\n\nRelatedly, some theorists have wanted to resist Hume\u2019s Law,\narguing that one can in fact validly draw normative or moral\nconclusions from purely descriptive premises (Foot 1958\u20139;\nSearle 1964). It is actually quite difficult to find an adequate\nformulation that is immune to counter-example, although many theorists\nsuspect there is nonetheless something right about Hume\u2019s claim\n(Humberstone 1996).\n\nThere may be a problem for those more sophisticated forms of\nnon-cognitivism according to which moral terms have both descriptive\nand prescriptive or expressive meaning when these are coupled with\nreliance on the Open Question Argument. Suppose that the postulated\nextra expressive or prescriptive component in moral terms explains why\ncompetent speakers would not equate moral terms with descriptive\nanalyses of them and that it also explains why we cannot validly infer\na moral conclusion from non-moral premises. If moral terms have\ndescriptive meaning in addition to their non-cognitive element one\nshould be able to validly argue in the other direction. The problem is\nthat competent speakers are just as likely to wonder about the\nvalidity of such inferences as they are to wonder about those going\nfrom descriptive premises to normative conclusions. If the openness of\nsuch questions to competent speakers is sufficient to refute claims of\nmeaning equivalence, it should here refute theories which include\ndescriptive meanings in an otherwise non-cognitive analysis. If the\narguments that lead non-cognitivists to postulate descriptive meaning\nare sufficiently compelling it seems they should not rely on the open\nquestion argument to support their views. Woods (2015) presses a\nrelated worry against even non-hybrid non-cognitivist theories. If the\nconventional function of moral terms is to express attitudes, it\nshould seem Moore-paradoxical (that is pragmatically incoherent) to\ndeny that one approves of the things one believes good or right. But\nmany such claims don\u2019t seem pragmatically incoherent.\n",
