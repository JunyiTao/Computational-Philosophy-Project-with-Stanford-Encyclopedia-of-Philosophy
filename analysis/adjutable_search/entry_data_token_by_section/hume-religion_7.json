    "main_text": "Hume\u2019s Genealogy of Religion: Causes and Dynamics of Religious Belief\n8. Hume\u2019s Genealogy of Religion: Causes and Dynamics of Religious Belief\n\nIn 1757 Hume published \u201cThe Natural History of\nReligion\u201d, a work that proposes to identify and explain the\norigins and evolution of religious belief. This project follows lines\nof investigation and criticism that had already been laid down by a\nnumber of other thinkers, including Lucretius, Hobbes and Spinoza.\nHume\u2019s primary objective in this work is to show that the\norigins and foundations of religious belief do not rest with reason or\nphilosophical arguments of any kind but with aspects of human nature\nthat reflect our weaknesses, vulnerabilities and limitations (i.e.,\nfear and ignorance). Related to this point, Hume also wants to show\nthat the basic forces in human nature and psychology that shape and\nstructure religious belief are in conflict with each other and that,\nas a result of this, religious belief is inherently unstable and\nvariable. In arguing for these points, Hume is directly challenging an\nopposing view, one that was widely held among his own orthodox\ncontemporaries. According to this view (e.g., as presented by\nCleanthes), the evidence of God\u2019s existence is so obvious that\nno one sincerely and honestly doubts it. Belief in an intelligent,\ninvisible creator and governor of the world is a universal belief\nrooted in and supported by reason. From this perspective, no person\nsincerely accepts \u201cspeculative atheism\u201d. Hume\u2019s\n\u201cnaturalistic\u201d approach to religion aims to discredit\nthese claims and assumptions of theism.\n\nAccording to Hume, all that the various religions in the world have in\ncommon is belief that there is an invisible, intelligent power in the\nworld (NHR, Intro, 4.1). Although there is a \u201cuniversal\npropensity to believe in invisible, intelligent power\u201d (NHR,\n15.5), even religious belief of this limited kind is not entirely\nuniversal or any sort of \u201coriginal instinct\u201d. Hume also\npoints out that religion of this most general kind is not to be\nconfused with \u201cgenuine theism\u201d. Genuine theism involves a\nmore specific set of beliefs: that there is only one god and that god\nis the invisible, intelligent creator and governor of the world (NHR,\n4.2). In several different contexts in The Natural History of\nReligion Hume suggests that the argument from design \u2014\nbased on our observation of beauty and order in the world \u2014 is a\nconvincing and plausible basis for genuine theism (NHR, Intro, 6.1,\n15.1). However, despite this veil of orthodoxy, his objective\nthroughout this work is to show that the actual foundation of genuine\ntheism, as we find it in the world, does not rest with reasoning or\narguments of any kind. The true roots of genuine theism can be\ndiscovered in the psychological dynamics that first give rise to\npolytheism. The same (irrational) forces that shape polytheism serve\nto explain the rise of theism and the instability and variations that\nwe discover within it.\n\nHume maintains that \u201cpolytheism or idolatry was, and must have\nbeen, the first and most ancient religion of mankind\u201d (NHR,\n1.1). Not only does the evidence of history make this clear (Hume\ndiscounts the historical reliability of the Hebrew Bible, which, as is\nwell-known, presents a different picture), we know as well that if\ntheism, based on the (obvious and convincing) argument of design, were\nthe original religion then it would be impossible to explain how\npolytheism could have ever arisen out of it. That is to say, the\nargument from design would continue to have the same force and so we\nshould not expect any deviation from it. What, then, is the origin of\npolytheism? The basis of polytheism is not the beauty and order we\ndiscover in the works of nature, as that leads us to genuine theism,\nit is rather \u201cthe various and contrary events of human\nlife\u201d. These are events (e.g., weather, illness, wars, etc.)\nthat are unpredictable but important to us because they directly\ninfluence human happiness and misery. In respect of these events,\nwhich engage our deepest hopes and fears, we are generally ignorant of\nthe causes that are involved in producing them \u2014 especially when\nhuman beings are in a more primitive and backward state of society. In\nthese circumstances, the \u201cignorant multitude\u201d conceives of\nthese unknown causes as depending on invisible, intelligent agents who\nthey may influence by means of prayers and sacrifice. By this means,\nhuman beings hope to control what they do not understand and are\nafraid of. As a result of this process, as shaped by human fears and\nignorance, the world becomes populated with human-like invisible,\nintelligent powers that are objects of worship.\n\nThe religion of polytheism is very different from genuine theism in so\nfar as it does not concern itself with the (abstract and speculative)\nquestion concerning the origin or supreme government of the universe.\nThese are questions that primitive people who are struggling for their\ndaily survival do not have time to speculate about. To this extent,\ntherefore, polytheists and idolaters may be regarded as\n\u201csuperstitious atheists\u201d, as they plainly have no idea of\na being that corresponds to our idea of God (NHR, 4.2). From their\nperspective, however, genuine theists are guilty of atheism, since\nthey deny the existence of the \u201csubordinate deities\u201d that\npolytheists worship (NHR, 4.10n27). The clear implication of these\nobservations is that the notion of \u201catheism\u201d \u2014 along\nwith its negative connotations \u2013 is entirely relative to a\nparticular religion and its particular conception of god or gods.\n\nThe question that Hume now turns to is how theism arose from\npolytheism. In respect of this issue, Hume observes that there are two\nconflicting tendencies in human nature.\n\nAnd thus, however strong men\u2019s propensity to believe invisible,\nintelligent power in nature, their propensity is equally strong to\nrest their attention on sensible, visible objects; and in order to\nreconcile these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite the\ninvisible power with some visible object. (NHR, 5.2)\n\n\nThese conflicting demands are best satisfied by representing the\nvarious gods as something like ourselves and attributing particular\nqualities and attributes to them that are relevant to their specific\nsphere of influence (e.g., the god of war is cruel and ferocious\netc.). Over time, among the vulgar, one of these gods will gradually\nemerge as a particular object of veneration and worship. In their\nanxiety to please and praise this god, worshippers will continually\ntry to outdo their predecessors by attributing greater and greater\npowers and perfections to him. At last they will reach a point where\nthey represent this god as infinite and entirely perfect, whereby they\nrender his nature inexplicable and mysterious. The irony about this,\nHume wryly observes, is that the vulgar arrive at a more\n\u201cphilosophical\u201d conception of God by way of a process that\nis shaped by principles that are entirely unguided by reason.\n\nAt this stage, Hume\u2019s genealogy of religion presents us with an\naccount of the same general conflict that he portrays in\nDialogues between Cleanthes\u2019s anthropomorphism and\nDemea\u2019s mysticism. This conflict, as Hume explains it, has deep\nroots in the dynamics of human nature and our conflicting\npropensities. The result of this process is an inherent instability in\ntheism itself. On the one side, there is a tendency, originally\npresent in polytheism, to anthropomorphize the gods in the hope of\nplacating and controlling them. On the other side, our\n\u201cexaggerated praise and compliments\u201d produce a refined and\nabstract idea of god that no longer satisfies the vulgar imagination.\nThe result of this situation is that there is \u201ca kind of flux\nand reflux in the human mind, and that men have a natural tendency to\nrise from idolatry to theism, and to sink again from theism into\nidolatry\u201d (NHR, 8.1).\n\nThe feeble apprehensions of men cannot be satisfied with conceiving\ntheir deity as a pure spirit and perfect intelligence; and yet their\nnatural terrors keep them from imputing to him the least shadow of\nlimitation and imperfection. They fluctuate between these opposite\nsentiments. (NHR, 8.2)\n\n\nThis influence of the human passions and propensities affects the\nstability of our idea of God in another way. Our natural fear of\nfuture events encourages a conception of God that is severe and cruel.\nAt the same time, \u201cthe spirit of praise and eulogy\u201d\npromotes an entirely contrary view (NHR, 176). Clearly, the general\npoint that Hume aims to establish by means of these observations is\nthat the natural sources of religion are in conflict with one another\nand generate a continual cycle of opposition and instability in our\nreligious beliefs and idea of god.\n\nHume\u2019s primary aim in The Natural History of Religion,\nas we have noted, is to show that the origin and foundations of\nreligious belief does not rest with reason or philosophical argument.\nThe origins of religious belief rest with human fear and ignorance,\nwhich gives rise, in the first place, to polytheism. The same\npsychological forces that give rise to polytheism gradually transform\nit into a system of theism. This system of theism is, however, itself\na product of conflicting tendencies in human nature that result in an\nunstable oscillation between anthropomorphic and mystical ideas of\ngod. As a result of this instability, there is a natural tendency for\ntheism to slide back into some form of polytheism that postulates\n\u201cdemi-gods\u201d, in order to satisfy the human need to have\nsome image or impression of God (NHR, 8.2, 15.5). Hume\u2019s remarks\non this tendency allude, clearly enough, to the case of Jesus Christ\nunderstood as the (human) incarnation of God.\n\nThe conclusion that Hume draws from all this is that religion\ngenerally rests on human weaknesses and vulnerabilities and that\nreason has little influence over its evolution or stability. While\n\u201cgenuine theism\u201d presents a view of God that is sublime\nand magnificent, most religion degrades and disfigures the idea of\ngod.\n\nSurvey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious principles,\nwhich have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be\npersuaded, that they are any thing but sick men\u2019s dreams. Or\nperhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkeys in\nhuman shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical assertions of a\nbeing who dignifies himself with the name of rational.
