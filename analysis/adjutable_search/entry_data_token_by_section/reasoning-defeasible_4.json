    "main_text": "Applications and Motivation || Defeasibility as a Convention of Communication\n2.1 Defeasibility as a Convention of Communication\n\nMuch of John McCarthy\u2019s early work in artificial intelligence\nconcerned the interpretation of stories and puzzles (McCarthy and\nHayes 1969; McCarthy 1977). McCarthy found that we often make\nassumptions based on what is not said. So, for example, in a puzzle\nabout safely crossing a river by canoe, we assume that there are no\nbridges or other means of conveyance available. Similarly, when using\na database to store and convey information, the information that, for\nexample, no flight is scheduled at a certain time is represented\nsimply by not listing such a flight. Inferences based on\nthese conventions are defeasible, however, because the conventions can\nthemselves be explicitly abrogated or suspended.\n\nNicholas Asher and his collaborators (Lascarides and Asher 1993, Asher\nand Lascarides 2003, Vieu, Bras, Asher, and Aurnague 2005, Txurruka\nand Asher 2008) have argued that defeasible reasoning is useful in\nunpacking the pragmatics of conversational implicature.\n",
