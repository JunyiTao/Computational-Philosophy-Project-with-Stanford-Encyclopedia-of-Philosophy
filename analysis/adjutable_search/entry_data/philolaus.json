    "preamble": "\n\nPhilolaus of Croton, in southern Italy, was a Greek\nphilosopher/scientist, who lived from ca. 470 to ca. 385 BC and was\nthus a contemporary of Socrates. He is one of the three most prominent\nfigures in the Pythagorean tradition, born a hundred years after\nPythagoras himself and fifty years before Archytas. He wrote one book,\nOn Nature, which was probably the first book to be written by\na Pythagorean. There has been considerable controversy concerning the\n20+ fragments which have been preserved in Philolaus\u2019 name. It is now\ngenerally accepted that some eleven of the fragments come from his\ngenuine book. Other books were forged in Philolaus\u2019 name at a later\ndate, and the remaining fragments come from these spurious works.\nPhilolaus argues that the cosmos and everything in it are made up of\ntwo basic types of things, limiters and unlimiteds. Unlimiteds are\ncontinua undefined by any structure or quantity; they include the\ntraditional Presocratic material elements such as earth, air, fire and\nwater but also space and time. Limiters set limits in such unlimiteds\nand include shapes and other structural principles. Limiters and\nunlimiteds are not combined in a haphazard way but are subject to a\n\u201cfitting together\u201d or \u201charmonia,\u201d which can be\ndescribed mathematically. Philolaus\u2019 primary example of such a\nharmonia of limiters and unlimiteds is a musical scale, in which the\ncontinuum of sound is limited according to whole number ratios, so\nthat the octave, fifth, and fourth are defined by the ratios 2 : 1, 3\n: 2 and 4 : 3, respectively. Since the whole world is structured\naccording to number, we only gain knowledge of the world insofar as we\ngrasp these numbers. The cosmos comes to be when the unlimited fire is\nfitted together with the center of the cosmic sphere (a limiter) to\nbecome the central fire. Philolaus was the precursor of Copernicus in\nmoving the earth from the center of the cosmos and making it a planet,\nbut in Philolaus\u2019 system it does not orbit the sun but rather the\ncentral fire. The astronomical system is a significant attempt to try\nto explain the phenomena but also has mythic and religious\nsignificance. Philolaus presented a medical theory in which there was\na clear analogy between the birth of a human being and the birth of\nthe cosmos. The embryo is conceived of as composed of the hot and then\nas drawing in cooling breath immediately upon birth, just as the\ncosmos begins with the heat of the central fire, which then draws in\nbreath along with void and time from the unlimited. Philolaus posited\na strict hierarchy of psychic faculties, which allows him to\ndistinguish human beings from animals and plants. He probably believed\nthat the transmigrating soul was a harmonious arrangement of physical\nelements located in the heart and that the body became ensouled when\nthe proper balance of hot and cold was established by the breathing of\nthe new-born infant. Philolaus\u2019 genuine book was one of the major\nsources for Aristotle\u2019s account of Pythagorean philosophy. There is\ncontroversy as to whether or not Aristotle\u2019s description of the\nPythagoreans as equating things with numbers is an accurate account of\nPhilolaus\u2019 view. Plato mentions Philolaus in the Phaedo and\nadapts Philolaus\u2019 metaphysical scheme for his own purposes in the\nPhilebus.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Writings\n1.1 Date, City of Origin and Connections to Other Philosophers\n\nWe know very little about Philolaus\u2019 life. Only one brief and not very\nreliable ancient life of Philolaus survives, that of Diogenes Laertius\n(VIII 84\u20135). Diogenes includes Philolaus among the Pythagoreans;\nindeed he is, in fact, one of the three most important figures in the\nancient Pythagorean tradition, along with Pythagoras himself and\nArchytas. The central evidence for Philolaus\u2019 date is Plato\u2019s\nreference to him in the Phaedo (61d\u2013e). Socrates\u2019\ninterlocutors, Simmias and Cebes, indicate that they had heard\nPhilolaus in Thebes at some time before the dramatic date of the\ndialogue (399 BC). The passage suggests that Philolaus was no longer\nin Thebes in 399, but there is no indication that he has died. In\norder for Philolaus to have been a prominent teacher by the later\nfifth century he must have been born no later than 440. There are\nother indications that he was born even earlier. Both Philolaus and\nEurytus are identified by Aristoxenus as teachers of the last\ngeneration of Pythagoreans (D. L. VIII 46), who were in their twenties\nin 400 and active in the first half of the fourth century. Philolaus\nis also said to be the teacher of Eurytus (Iamblichus, VP\n139), however, so that the tradition makes most sense if Eurytus is\nborn ca. 440, and Philolaus belongs to the preceding generation and is\nthus born ca. 470. Such a dating would also fit with the tradition\nthat Philolaus was the teacher of and thus somewhat older than\nDemocritus (D. L. IX 38), who was born ca. 460. It is even less clear\nwhen he died, but one report suggests that he may still have been\nalive in the early 380s, when Plato first visited southern Italy (D.L.\nIII 6). If he lived from ca. 470 to ca. 385, Philolaus is an\napproximate contemporary of Socrates. Plutarch\u2019s story that as a young\nman Philolaus was one of two to escape the burning of the Pythagorean\nmeeting place in Metapontum in 454 (On the Sign of Socrates\n583a) would be consistent with this dating, but earlier versions of\nthe story do not mention Philolaus (Aristoxenus in Iamblichus,\nVP 249\u201350) so that it is far from certain that he was\ninvolved in the incident.\n\nDiogenes Laertius says that Philolaus was from the Greek city of\nCroton in southern Italy, but our earliest sources are divided as to\nhis city or origin. In his history of medicine, Aristotle\u2019s pupil\nMeno, who had access to Philolaus\u2019 book, also says that Philolaus was\nfrom Croton (DK 44 A27), but another of Aristotle\u2019s pupils,\nAristoxenus, who had close connections to the Pythagoreans, presents\nPhilolaus as from another Greek city in southern Italy, Tarentum (D.\nL. VIII 46, see also Iamblichus, VP 267, which probably\nderives from Aristoxenus). Perhaps the best way to solve the conflict\nis to suppose that Philolaus originally came from Croton and that,\nfollowing attacks on the Pythagoreans in other southern Italian cities\nca. 450 and his trip to Thebes in the late 400s, he may have settled\nin Tarentum late in his life. He is reported to have been the teacher\nof Archytas of Tarentum in one source (Cicero, de Orat. III\n34.139).\n\nThe ancient tradition gives no indication of who Philolaus\u2019 teacher(s)\nmight have been. Pythagoras died some twenty years before Philolaus\nwas born. He might have had some contact with the Pythagorean Hippasus\n(ca. 530\u2013450?), who was associated with the mathematics of music\ntheory, which is also a prominent theme in Philolaus. Philolaus should\nnot be understood as simply a Pythagorean, however. He was an\nimportant philosopher in his own right, and neither Plato nor Meno\nbothers to apply the label Pythagorean to him. He was influenced not\njust by the Pythagorean tradition but also as much or more by the\nbroader tradition of Presocratic philosophy. He was undoubtedly aware\nof the work of the medical writer/philosopher Alcmaeon, who also came\nfrom Croton. Anaxagoras and Empedocles were the most prominent\nphilosophers in the generation before Philolaus, and there is some\nevidence that he was in part responding to Anaxagoras (see 2.1).\nPhilolaus was the contemporary of the mathematicians Hippocrates of\nChios, who was the first to write an Elements of geometry,\nand Theodorus of Cyrene, and, although Philolaus was not a\nmathematician himself, his philosophy appears to have been influenced\nby the important new developments in Greek mathematics that they\nbrought about. Like most philosophers of the fifth century his work is\nin part a response to Parmenides (see 2.1 and 3).\u00a0\n1.2 The Authenticity Question\n\nIn the case of most ancient authors, the assumption is that a text\nhanded down in their name is genuine, unless strong reasons can be\ngiven for regarding it as a forgery. This standard assumption does not\napply to the Pythagorean tradition. Many more demonstrably spurious\ntexts have survived (collected in Thesleff 1965) than texts that can\nwith confidence be regarded as genuine. Some forgeries may have been\nproduced for monetary reasons; a text of a \u201crare\u201d work by\na Pythagorean author could fetch a large sum from book collectors.\nThere were characteristics unique to the Pythagorean tradition,\nhowever, that led to a proliferation of forgeries. Pythagoras himself\nwrote nothing. Starting as early as the later fourth century BC\n(Burkert 1972a, 53\u201383; Huffman 1993, 22\u20136), however, he\ncame to be regarded, in some circles, as the philosopher par\nexcellence, to whom all truth had been revealed. All later philosophy,\ninsofar as it was true, was a restatement of this original revelation\n(see, e.g., O\u2019Meara 1989). In order to support this view of\nPythagoras, texts were forged in the name of Pythagoras and other\nearly Pythagoreans, showing that they had, in fact, anticipated the\nmost important ideas of Plato and Aristotle. These pseudo-Pythagorean\ntexts are thus characterized by the use of central Platonic and\nAristotelian ideas, expressed in technical Platonic and Aristotelian\nterminology. The date and place of origin of these pseudo-Pythagorean\ntreatises is difficult to determine, but most seem to have been\ncomposed between 150 BC and 100 AD (Burkert 1972b; Centrone 1990 and\n2014; Moraux 1984); Rome (Burkert 1972b) and Alexandria (Centrone 1990\nand 2014) are the most likely places of origin. As a result of these\nunique features of the Pythagorean tradition, any fragment assigned to\na Pythagorean philosopher such as Philolaus must be examined carefully\nbefore it can be accepted as genuine.\n\nIn 1962, Guthrie, in his History of Greek Philosophy,\nregarded the issue of the authenticity of the fragments handed down in\nPhilolaus\u2019 name as undecided, although he commented that opponents of\nauthenticity did \u201cnot seem to be at their best on the\nsubject\u201d (331). In that same year Burkert provided decisive\narguments, which have led to a consensus that a core of the fragments\nof Philolaus are authentic. Earlier discussions of the authenticity of\nthe fragments were often based on the faulty assumption that the\nfragments were either all genuine or all spurious. Opponents of\nauthenticity typically showed that a few of the fragments were\nspurious and then assumed that all the rest were as well (e.g.,\nBywater 1868). Given the amount of forgery in the Pythagorean\ntradition, however, even if fragments from a genuine book of Philolaus\nsurvive, it is likely that fragments from spurious works survive as\nwell. Burkert made a crucial distinction between two traditions\nconcerning Pythagoreanism. One begins already in Plato\u2019s Academy and\ntreats Pythagoreanism as largely identical with later Platonic\nthought, including the postulation of the one and the indefinite dyad\nas first principles (1972a, 53\u201383). This is the tradition which\ncame to dominate among later Neoplatonists and which served as the\nbasis for the production of the pseudo-Pythagorean writings. The\nsecond tradition is represented by Aristotle, who presents\nfifth-century Pythagoreanism as having had some influence on Plato but\nas radically different from Plato in making no distinction between the\nintelligible and sensible world (1972a, 28\u201352). Burkert then\nshowed that, while some of the fragments of Philolaus did employ\nPlatonic and Aristotelian ideas and hence were spurious, other\nfragments were in very close agreement with Aristotle\u2019s account of\nfifth-century Pythagoreanism and hence likely to be authentic.\n\nAristotle\u2019s testimony on the Pythagoreans gives rise to one remaining\npuzzle, which is relevant to the authenticity of the core of fragments\nidentified by Burkert. Aristotle specifically identifies the\nPythagoreanism that he discusses as contemporary with or a little\nearlier than the atomists (Metaph. 985b23 ff.). This dating\nfits Philolaus exactly. Aristotle discusses the Pythagoreans in many\nplaces and he is clearly not always referring to Philolaus.\nNonetheless, the central Pythagorean metaphysical and cosmological\nsystem to which Aristotle refers repeatedly, with limiters and\nunlimiteds as first principles, the emphasis on the role of harmony in\nthe cosmos and the peculiar astronomical system, which makes the earth\na planet orbiting around the central fire, corresponds in great detail\nwith the fragments and testimonia preserved in the later tradition as\ncoming from Philolaus\u2019 book (Metaph. 986a8\u201321,\n987a13\u201317,990a8\u201310 etc.; for an opposing view see Zhmud\n1998). The problem is that Aristotle never explicitly describes the\nPythagoreanism which he discusses as derived from Philolaus\u2019 book. He\nonly refers to Philolaus once by name, and that is in relation to an\napothegm which has no obvious connection to his general presentation\nof Pythagoreanism (EE 1225a30 = Fr. 16). Everywhere else\nAristotle refers to the system he describes as the work of \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans\u201d or the Italian philosophers. The former\nexpression shows that Aristotle has his doubts about the connections\nbetween these philosophers and Pythagoras himself. Aristotle never\nmentions Pythagoras himself in connection with the system of\n\u201cthe so-called Pythagoreans\u201d and clearly dates that system\nafter the time of Pythagoras. If Aristotle is relying heavily on\nPhilolaus\u2019 book, however, why does he never mention Philolaus by name\nwhen describing the Pythagorean system? Some might argue that\nAristotle did not know of a book by Philolaus and hence that there was\nno such book. Two considerations suggest another explanation. First,\nAristotle discusses the Pythagorean system in considerable detail and\nin at least one passage strongly implies that what he is reporting is\nbased on a written text (Metaph. 1091a13). As Burkert notes,\nthat written source cannot have been ascribed to \u201cthe so-called\nPythagoreans\u201d and must have been assigned to some author. The\nevidence suggests that Philolaus\u2019 book was the only book by a\nPythagorean circulating in the fifth century (see 1.3 below), and, as\nwe have seen, the reports of the contents of that book agree with what\nAristotle reports quite closely. There simply is no other plausible\ncandidate for Aristotle\u2019s written source. Second, Philolaus\u2019 book\nseems to have been available to Aristotle\u2019s pupil Meno (DK 44\nA27\u20138) and hence is likely to have been available to Aristotle\nas well. The most reasonable conclusion is that Aristotle is relying\nlargely on Philolaus\u2019 book for his description of fifth-century\nPythagoreanism but chooses not to refer to him explicitly. Aristotle\nmakes clear that there are several groups of people included under the\nheading \u201cso-called Pythagoreans,\u201d by explicitly\ndistinguishing those Pythagoreans who posited the table of opposites\nfrom the main Pythagorean system which he describes (Metaph.\n986a22). For whatever reason, it was the fashion to refer to a group\nof related figures as Pythagoreans, and Aristotle follows this fashion\nrather than singling Philolaus out from the group, even though he\nrelies heavily on Philolaus\u2019 book. Primavesi has recently suggested\nthat some of the puzzles about Aristotle\u2019s account of Pythagoreanism\ncan be mitigated if we recognize that he presents a developmental\nacount by reconstructing a gradual transition from early\narithmological speculations to Philolaus\u2019 theory of principles (2014).\n\n1.3 Philolaus\u2019 Book: Genuine Fragments and Testimonia\n\nIt is important to distinguish between two traditions regarding\nPhilolaus\u2019 publication of books (Burkert 1972a, 223\u20137; Huffman\n1993, 12\u201315). In one tradition, which is likely to be reliable,\nPhilolaus is reported to have published a single book, which came to\nbear the traditional title for all Presocratic philosophical\ntreatises, On Nature, although it is doubtful that this title\ngoes back to Philolaus himself. This tradition is found in Diogenes\nLaertius (VIII 85) but goes back to Hermippus (3rd BC) and\nTimon (DK 44 A8; 320\u2013230 BC). Diogenes quotes the first sentence\nof this book, and it is likely that it was available to Aristotle and\nhis pupil Meno in the fourth century (see section 1.2 above). This\ntradition also suggests that Plato cribbed the Timaeus from\nPhilolaus\u2019 book. The accusation of plagiarism on Plato\u2019s part is\nabsurd, but there are enough general similarities between the\nTimaeus and Philolaus\u2019 book to explain the origin of the\naccusation (e.g., the musical scale which Plato uses in the\nconstruction of the world soul corresponds to the scale in Philolaus,\nFr. 6a). This book of Philolaus is also likely to be the first book\npublished in the Pythagorean tradition. Diogenes asserts that\nPhilolaus was the first Pythagorean to publish a treatise on nature\n(VIII 85). Pythagoras wrote nothing, and we are told that the same is\ntrue of Philolaus\u2019 immediate predecessor in the Pythagorean tradition,\nHippasus (D. L. VIII 84). Some scholars argue that there were books by\nPythagoreans earlier than Philolaus (Zhmud 1989 and 2012: 121\u20139), but,\nwhere there is clear evidence for a book, it is unlikely that the\nfigure is a Pythagorean (e.g. Alcmaeon) and, where the figure is\nclearly a Pythagorean, there is no explicit evidence for a book (e.g.\nHippasus). A second tradition reports that Plato bought three books\nfrom Philolaus (D. L. III 9; VIII 15 and 84). It is implied that these\nbooks were not by Philolaus himself, and it seems likely that the\nstatement refers to three spurious works assigned to Pythagoras at\nD.L. VIII 6\u00a0 (Burkert 1972a, 224\u20135). The story of Plato\u2019s\npurchase of these books from Philolaus was probably invented to\nauthenticate the three forged treatises of Pythagoras.\n\nBurkert\u2019s arguments (1972a, 238\u2013277), supported by further\nstudy (Huffman 1993), have led to a consensus that some 11 fragments\nare genuine (Frs. 1\u20136, 6a, 7, 13, 16 and 17) and derive from\nPhilolaus\u2019 book On Nature (Barnes 1982; Kahn 1993 and\n2001; Kirk, Raven and Schofield 1983; Nussbaum 1979; Zhmud 2012,\nGraham 2014). Fragments 1, 6a and 13 are identified as coming from the\nbook On Nature by ancient sources. Stobaeus cites fragments 2\nand 4\u20137 as coming from a work On the Cosmos, but this\nappears to be an alternate title for On Nature, which\nprobably arose because the chapter heading in Stobaeus under which the\nfragments are cited is \u2018On the Cosmos.\u2019 Testimonia A7a,\nA9, A10, A16 (part), A17 (part), A18\u201324, A27\u20139 are also\ngenerally agreed to reflect the contents of On Nature. The\nauthenticity of some fragments and testimonia remains\ncontroversial. Fr. 6b and Testimonium A 26, which, in contrast to\nFr. 6a, take a numerological approach rather than a properly\nmathematical approach to music theory, were accepted as authentic by\nBurkert (1972a, 394\u2013400; followed by Mueller 1997, 292\u20133),\nwhereas Huffman argues that they are spurious (1993, 364\u201374;\nfollowed by Zhmud 1997, 185). Recent scholarship on harmonic theory\nargues that the conflict in approach may be less significant than it\nappears at first sight (see the end of section 2.2 below) and that 6b\nand A26 may thus be authentic (Barker 2007: 271; Hagel 2009:\n143\u2013151). Similarly, Burkert accepts A 14 as genuine and as\nrepresenting the earliest evidence for horoscopic astrology in Greece\n(1972a, 350), whereas Huffman argues against authenticity (1993,\n381\u201391).\n1.4 Spurious Fragments and Testimonia\n\nThere are 15 fragments which are generally believed to be spurious (8,\n8a, 9\u201312, 14, 15, 19, 20a, 20b, 20c, 21\u2013 23) and six\ntestimonia (11\u201313, 16b, 17b, 30) that are based on spurious\nworks (Huffman 1993, 341\u2013420). In two instances we are given\ntitles for the spurious works from which the fragments come. Fragment\n21 is said to come from On the Soul and Fr. 22 from On\nRhythms and Measures. There are two problematic references to a\nwork entitled Bacchae. Stobaeus cites Frs. 17 and 18 as\ncoming from this work. Fr. 18, which dealt with the sun, was lost in\nthe transmission of Stobaeus, but Fr. 17 is generally accepted as\nauthentic on the basis of its contents and on those grounds would\nappear to come from On Nature. This might suggest that\nBacchae was an alternative title for On Nature\n(Burkert 1972a, 269). On the other hand, Proclus describes the\nBacchae as teaching theology by means of mathematics (DK 44\nB19; Huffman 1993, 417\u20138), which is not a very apt description\nof the central surviving fragments of On Nature, but would\nfit the astrological material of controversial authenticity, which is\ncited elsewhere by Proclus (A14\u2014see 1.3 above). Thus it may be\nthat Bacchae is the title of a spurious work and that Fr. 17\nwas mistakenly assigned to that work. Kingsley argues that the title\nis genuine and one of several pieces of evidence for a connection\nbetween the Pythagoreans and Bacchic mysteries (1995: 262).\nStamatellos (2007: 102\u2013103) suggests that Fragments 21 and 23\nare authentic, but the overwhelming consensus of other scholars\nregards them as spurious (see Burkert 1972: 242\u2013243, who refers\nto previous scholarship and Huffman 1993: 343\u2013344). Mansfeld\n(2016) suggests a quite plausible emendation to Fr. 12 but still\nregards it as spurious. McKirahan (2016) argues that B14 is genuine,\nbut Philolaus\u2019 use of psyche in the genuine B13 is\nincompatible with its use in B14.\n2. Basic Principles of Reality\n2.1 Limiters and Unlimiteds\n\nPhilolaus begins his book with a bold statement of his central insight\nabout reality:\n\nNature (physis) in the world-order (cosmos) was\nfitted together out of things which are unlimited and out of things\nwhich are limiting, both the world-order as a whole and everything in\nit. (Fr. 1)\n\n\nThe language of this fragment shows that Philolaus is firmly in the\ntradition of Presocratic philosophy. Aristotle refers to the\nPresocratics as the physiologoi, \u201cwriters on\nnature,\u201d and it is precisely nature (physis) that is\nthe first word of Philolaus\u2019 book. Physis here means\n\u201cnature\u201d or \u201creal constitution\u201d and finds a\ngood parallel in Heraclitus\u2019 famous saying that \u201cnature\nloves to hide\u201d (fr. 123). Philolaus uses it universally to refer\nto the natures of all individual things in the world as well as the\nnature of the cosmos as a whole. For an alternate view see Zhmud\n(2018) who argues that it means \u201call the things that have come\ninto being and exist.\u201d Zhmud points out that Philolaus is the\nfirst thinker to make physis the main subject of his\nbook. The next words show that Philolaus, like his Presocratic\npredecessors, regarded the natural world as a cosmos, as an order, and\nsaw it as his central problem to explain that order. His answer to\nthat problem, however, is quite unlike earlier answers. Earlier\nPresocratics had tended to explain the natural world in terms of\nmaterial elements such as water or air, or groups of elements such as\nthe earth, air, fire and water of Empedocles.  Opposites such as the\nhot and the cold or the rare and the dense also played a prominent\nrole. Instead of these concrete and tangible substances Philolaus\nappeals to things which are unlimited, \u201cunlimiteds,\u201d and\nthings which limit, \u201climiters.\u201d The basic problem in\nunderstanding Philolaus\u2019 philosophy is thus to determine what he\nmeans by limiters and unlimiteds. In the surviving fragments, he never\nprovides a definition of these terms nor does he provide an explicit\nexample. Nonetheless he uses them repeatedly. In Fragment 2 he argues\nthat the basic elements of the world must logically be either all\nlimiters, all unlimiteds or both limiters and unlimiteds. He is\nemphatic here and argues further in Fr. 3, evidently against some of\nhis predecessors, that the basic elements cannot be simply\nunlimiteds. Since the world around us manifestly contains some things\nthat limit, some that are unlimited and others that are both limiting\nand unlimited, we must suppose that the elements from which the world\narose included both limiters and unlimiteds (Fr. 2). How could a\nlimiter arise from an unlimited or an unlimited from a limiter? In\nFr. 6 Philolaus argues that we cannot say anything more definite about\nthe ultimate principles of reality (\u201cnature in itself\u201d and\n\u201cthe being of things\u201d). We can only go so far as to say\nthat they must have included limiters and unlimiteds in order for the\nworld we see around us to have arisen. Beyond this description the\nbasic principles of reality admit only of divine and not of human\nknowledge. Thus, it is a matter of principle that Philolaus does not\nidentify any particular set of limiters and unlimiteds as the basic\nprinciples of the world; identification of such a set is beyond human\ncapability. On the other hand, he clearly thinks that we can recognize\nlimiters and unlimiteds in the world around us and repeatedly appeals\nto this fact. If the cosmos and everything in it is put together from\nlimiters and unlimiteds, we ought to be able to identify some of\nthem.\n\nIt is logical to begin with the very first thing that is put together\nin Philolaus\u2019 cosmos. In Fragment 7 Philolaus asserts that \u201cThe\nfirst thing fitted together, the one in the center of the sphere, is\ncalled the hearth.\u201d From other evidence we know that this hearth\nin the center of Philolaus\u2019 cosmos was known as the central fire,\naround which all the heavenly bodies, including the earth, orbit.\nSince the central fire is explicitly said to have been \u201cfitted\ntogether,\u201d according to Fr. 1 it must have been fitted together\nout of a limiter and an unlimited, like everything else in the cosmos.\nIt appears that the term \u201ccentral fire\u201d itself identifies\nthe limiter and unlimited from which it is composed. It is composed of\nthe unlimited fire, which is limited by its position in the center of\nthe sphere. One interpretation then would be that unlimiteds are\nstuffs and limiters are shapes (Barnes 1982, 387 ff.). It is striking\nconfirmation of this conjecture that many earlier Presocratics\ndescribed their material principles as \u201cunlimited.\u201d\nAnaximander posited the unlimited as the source from which the basic\nmaterial principles of the world, the opposites such as hot and cold,\nemerged, and his successor Anaximenes explicitly described his basic\nmaterial principle air, as unlimited (DK 13 A1 and A6). Anaxagoras, in\nthe generation before Philolaus, described all the things in the\noriginal mixture from which the world emerges as unlimited and this\nlist would appear to include air, aither (Fr. 1), dry, wet, hot, cold,\nbright, dark (Fr. 4), dense and rare (Fr. 12). Thus, Philolaus\u2019\nunlimiteds probably included stuffs in the broad Presocratic sense,\nwhich treats opposites such as the hot and the cold as material\nsubstances. The next stage in Philolaus\u2019 cosmogony after the\nconstruction of the central fire helps to identify yet more\nunlimiteds. In his lost work On the Pythagoreans Aristotle\ndescribes the universe as drawing in time, breath, and void from the\nunlimited (Arist., Fr. 201). This text certainly means that the\nuniverse was surrounded by an unlimited from which time, breath and\nvoid were drawn, but it probably also means that time, breath and void\nwere regarded as unlimiteds. Breath can be equated with air as a\ntypical Presocratic stuff, but time and the void show that we must\nexpand Philolaus\u2019 conception of unlimiteds beyond stuffs. Unlimiteds\nappear to be not just materials, which can appear in various shapes,\nbut also continua, like time, which can be limited by various measures\nbut which do not have a shape. Philolaus thus accepts the earlier\nPresocratic reliance on material principles but introduces two radical\nchanges. First, he thinks it beyond human knowledge to identify any\nprivileged set of unlimiteds, such as earth, air, fire and water, as\nultimate elements. Second, he focuses not on the qualitative features\nof these stuffs (e.g. hot) but rather on their role as continua\n(Huffman 1993: 43\u20134; Graham 2014: 52).\n\nPhilolaus\u2019 most significant innovation, however, is to argue that the\ncosmos cannot be adequately explained in terms of unlimiteds alone.\nThere appear to be two related arguments for this thesis. First,\nPhilolaus takes it as self-evident that the world is full of limiters\nsuch as shapes. If this is so, however, we must suppose that limiters\nwere among the basic principles from which the world arose, since it\nis impossible for what limits to arise from what is unlimited (Fr. 2).\nSecond, in Fragment 3, he argues that if all things are unlimited then\n\u201cthere will not be anything that is going to know.\u201d This\nargument makes most sense if directed against Anaxagoras, who\ngenerates the world from elements that are all unlimited (Fr. 1), but\nwho claims that mind (nous), which is also said to be\nunlimited, knows all the things that are separated off from the\noriginal mixture (Fr. 12). Philolaus seems to regard the act of\nknowing as an act of limitation and hence as impossible, if reality is\ncomposed just of unlimiteds (Huffman 1993, 119\u2013120). Parmenides\nis the only Presocratic before Philolaus to emphasize the role of\nlimit in his account of reality. Parmenides likens reality to a sphere\nand describes it as held in the bonds of a limit (DK 28 B8).\nPhilolaus\u2019 insistence that the ultimate elements from which the cosmos\ndeveloped must have included not just unlimiteds but also limiters is\nbest understood as an attempt to integrate Parmenides\u2019 insights about\nthe nature of reality with the earlier Presocratic emphasis on\nmaterial elements which are unlimited (Huffman 1999). Earlier\nPresocratics, such as Heraclitus (DK B30, B31), had recognized that\nthere was measure and structure in the world but no Presocratic had\nmade structure an element or principle in the world with the same\nstatus as material principles. It is Philolaus who first insists that\nstructure is equal in importance to material constitution (Huffman\n2013b; Graham 2014: 53). Philolaus\u2019 explanation of the cosmos in terms\nof limiters and unlimiteds cannot be fully understood, however,\nwithout discussing his third basic principle, harmonia.\n2.2 Harmony\n\nAlready in Fragment 1, Philolaus appealed not just to limiters and\nunlimiteds in order to explain the world but asserted that the cosmos\nas a whole and everything in it only arose when limiters and\nunlimiteds were \u201charmonized\u201d or \u201cfitted\ntogether.\u201d Fragment 6 is even more explicit on the need for\nharmony:\n\n\u2026since these beginnings [i.e. limiters and unlimiteds]\npreexisted and were neither alike nor even related, it would not have\nbeen possible for them to be ordered, if a harmony had not come upon\nthem\u2026 Like things and related things did not in addition\nrequire any harmony, but things that are unlike and not even related\n\u2026 it is necessary that such things be bonded together by a\nharmony, if they are going to be held in an order.\n\n\nGraham suggests that harmony as a principle required to allow limiters\nand unlimiteds to combine prefigures Platonic participation and\nAristotelian ontological predication (Graham 2014: 53\u20134). In Fragment\n6a Philolaus goes on to describe this harmony and what he describes is\na musical scale, the scale known as the Pythagorean diatonic, which\nwas used later by Plato in the Timaeus in the construction of\nthe world soul. This scale provides Philolaus\u2019 only surviving explicit\nexample of the bonding together of limiters and unlimiteds by a\nharmony. A musical scale presupposes an unlimited continuum of\npitches, which must be limited in some way in order for a scale to\narise. The crucial point is that not just any set of limiters will do.\nWe cannot just pick pitches at random along the continuum and produce\na scale that will be musically pleasing. The scale that Philolaus\nadopts is such that the ratio of the highest to the lowest pitch is 2\n: 1, which produces the interval of an octave. That octave is in turn\ndivided into a fifth and a fourth, which have the ratios of 3 : 2 and\n4 : 3 respectively and which, when added, make an octave. If we go up\na fifth from the lowest note in the octave and then up a fourth from\nthere, we will reach the upper note of the octave. Finally the fifth\ncan be divided into three whole tones, each corresponding to the ratio\nof 9 : 8 and a remainder with a ratio of 256 : 243 and the fourth into\ntwo whole tones with the same remainder (for more on Fr. 6a see\nMcKirahan 2012 and Huffman 1993: 145\u2013165). Thus, in Philolaus\u2019\nsystem the fitting together of limiters and unlimiteds involves their\ncombination in accordance with ratios of numbers. Similarly the cosmos\nand the individual things in the cosmos do not arise by a chance\ncombination of limiters and unlimiteds; the limiters and unlimiteds\nmust be fitted together in a pleasing way in accordance with number\nfor an order to arise. Fragment 6a suggests that Philolaus saw the\ncosmos as put together according to the diatonic scale. This would be\nvery much in accord with the famous conception of the harmony of the\nspheres according to which the heavenly bodies make harmonious music\nas they move, but neither in Philolaus nor any other early source do\nwe get an explicit account of how the musical scale corresponds to the\nastronomical system (Huffman 1993, 279\u201383; Zhmud 2012: 343\u20134\ndenies that there was any connection between the harmony of the\nspheres and Philolaus\u2019 system ).\n\nMost scholars agree that Philolaus was not interested in harmonic\ntheory for its own sake as were Archytas, Aristoxenus and much later\nPtolemy (Barker 2007: 278\u2013286; Creese 2010: 104). There is also\nno evidence that he used a monochord in order to determine or\ndemonstrate harmonic relationships (Creese 2010: 104\u2013117).\nHowever, even if Philolaus\u2019 main interest was the application of\nharmonics to cosmology, the approach to harmonics found in Fragment 6a\nand in the disputed 6b and A26 has been of considerable interest to\nhistorians of harmonic theory, and their conclusions are highly\nrelevant to the issue of the authenticity of 6b and A26. By the end of\nthe fourth century there was a marked division between Pythagorean\nharmonic theorists who regarded musical intervals as corresponding to\nwhole number ratios and followers of Aristoxenus who regarded them as\nlinear magnitudes. For Aristoxenus the octave consisted of six equal\ntones added together and could be divided in half. For the\nPythagoreans the octave was made up of ratios which were combined not\nby addition but by multiplication (e.g. the octave [2 : 1] = the\nproduct of the fifth [3 : 2] and the fourth [4 : 3], not the sum). The\noctave was a little less than six tones (9 : 8), and neither it nor\nthe tone could be divided in halves. Fragment 6a of Philolaus mentions\nthe ratios that correspond to the intervals (e.g., the tone is 9 : 8)\nwhereas Fragment 6b and A26 present intervals as linear magnitudes\n(e.g., the tone is 27). Since 6a treats intervals as corresponding to\nratios in a properly Pythagorean way, it has usually been accepted as\nauthentic and the difference in approach found in 6b and A26 has been\nseen as incompatible with 6a and hence as indicative of their\nspuriousness. Recently some scholars, on the other hand, have\nsuggested that in Philolaus\u2019 time this split between regarding\nintervals as ratios and regarding them as linear magnitudes had not\nbeen fully developed and that Philolaus may have regarded the two\napproaches as compatible (Hagel 2009: 144; Creese 2010: 116, n. 119).\nBarker supports this point by arguing that Philolaus is employing both\napproaches already in Fragment 6a. Thus, while the fragment equates\ncertain ratios with certain intervals, Philolaus does nothing\nmathematically with those ratios and instead emphasizes that intervals\nhave size and can be combined to create the octave, which suggests\nthat he thinks of them as linear magnitudes (Barker 2007:\n264\u2013271). This same combination of intervals as ratios and\nintervals as linear magnitudes can be seen in Fragment 6b and A26,\nwhere there is the additional emphasis on halving intervals. The\nhalving of intervals seems to be directed at finding the mid-point of\nthe octave and this might have been important in Philolaus\u2019\napplication of the octave to the cosmos, where the center is important\nfor the symmetry of the whole system (Barker 2007: 277; cf. Hagel\n2009: 151). Moreover, Aristotle\u2019s description of fifth-century\nPythagoreanism seems to display the same odd mixture of ratios and\nindividual numbers (Barker 2007: 286). However, there are some\ndifficulties for this approach. While Fragment 6a does emphasize the\nsize of intervals and their combination to form the octave, size need\nnot mean linear magnitude and combination need not mean addition. In\nfact, no specific linear magnitudes (e.g. 27, which is equated with\nthe tone in A26) are mentioned. The only sizes of intervals mentioned\nare precisely the ratios. Nor is there any evidence in Fragment 6a of\nany interest on Philolaus\u2019 part in halving intervals. The situation is\nquite the reverse. He uniformly presents the octave and, indeed, all\nintervals as composed of unequal parts (e.g., the octave is composed\nof the fourth and the fifth). Thus, while it is impossible to deny\nthat Philolaus might have tried to embrace both concepts of the nature\nof a musical interval, Fragment 6a still differs from 6b and A26 in\nbeing totally intelligible on the assumption that intervals correspond\nto ratios and in making no overt use of linear magnitudes or halves of\nsuch magnitudes (Huffman 2012: 235; cf. McKirahan 2012).\n2.3 The Method of Archai\n\nIn each area of inquiry Philolaus appears to proceed by identifying\nthe minimum number of archai, \u201cbeginnings\u201d or\n\u201cstarting points,\u201d necessary to explain the phenomena in\nthat area (Huffman 1993, 78\u201392). In the case of the cosmos as a\nwhole, as we have just seen in Fr. 6, Philolaus argues that three\nstarting points must be assumed, limiters, unlimiteds, and harmony, as\na third element to hold these two unlike elements together. In the\ncase of disease, Philolaus identifies three archai, bile,\nblood and phlegm (see 6.2 below). In the case of living creatures, the\nbrain is the starting point to which we must appeal to explain human\nbeings, the heart as the seat of sensation is the crucial factor in\nexplaining animals, the navel as the seat of rooting (the umbilical\ncord is regarded as a root) is the distinctive starting point of\nplants, and finally the genitals are a factor common to all animate\nbeings in contrast to the inanimate world (Fr. 13, see 5.1). This\napproach to explanation seems to have been developed under the\ninfluence of contemporary mathematicians and medical writers. Graham\nargues that in his use of archai to mean something like\n\u201cprinciples\u201d Philolaus achieves \u201c a level of\nabstraction that surpasses ... probably all of his predecessors\u201d\nand takes an important step towards Aristotle\u2019s conception of\narchai as starting points of being or explanation (Graham\n2014: 62). \n3. Epistemology: The Role of Number\n\nIn the discussion of harmony above, another crucial concept in\nPhilolaus\u2019 philosophy emerged, number. What role does number play in\nPhilolaus\u2019 system? Fragment 4 provides a relatively clear answer to\nthis question:\n\nAnd indeed all things that are known have number. For it is not\npossible that anything whatsoever be understood or known without this.\n\n\nNumber plays an epistemological role; it is what allows things to be\nknown and understood. There are several ways to interpret this claim.\nSome scholars have regarded \u201chaving number\u201d as the\nnecessary condition for the mere apprehension of an object. If\nsomething is not countable and hence distinguishable from other\nthings, it can\u2019t be recognized as a separate entity at all (Nussbaum\n1979; Kirk, Raven and Schofield 1983, 327). The epistemological\nvocabulary which Philolaus uses (noein and\ngign\u00f4skein), however, more typically refers to\nunderstanding and knowledge than to simple apprehension of an object\n(Huffman 1993, 116\u2013118). Several fragments make appeals to sense\nexperience without mentioning the concept of number (e.g. Fr. 2), so\nthat it would appear that Philolaus thinks that we can initially\napprehend objects through our senses but that we only come to have\ntrue knowledge or understanding of them by grasping their number.\nFragment 13 makes a clear distinction between sense perception, which\nhumans and animals share, and understanding, which is limited to\nhumans. Animals can apprehend objects in the world just as humans do,\nbut they do not understand them because they cannot grasp the numbers\nwhich govern them, as humans can. Such an interpretation is supported\nby Fragment 5:\n\nNumber, indeed, has two proper kinds, odd and even, and a third from\nboth mixed together, the even-odd. Of each of these two kinds there\nare many forms, of which each thing itself gives signs.\n\n\nThe last sentence of the fragment seems to say that individual things\nin the world \u201cgive signs\u201d of the many forms of number. Our\nfirst experience of a musical scale comes through simple sense\nperception, but, when the phenomena are studied further, they\n\u201cgive signs of\u201d or \u201cpoint to\u201d the whole-number\nratios that govern the musical intervals. Once we grasp these ratios,\nwe can claim to understand or know the scale. McKirahan (2012) argues\nthat in Fr. 6a Philolaus formally demonstrates that ratios are numbers\nand that the many forms of numbers in Fr. 5 are the different types of\nratios. Huffman (1993: 174) argues that Philolaus\u2019 use of the term\nnumber includes ratios from the start and that the many forms of\nnumbers are just the even and odd natural numbers (1993: 191; cf.\n2012). Mourelatos has shown that Fragment 5 is also important\nin the history of the development of the concept of the universal.\nPhilolaus distinguishes between numbers as individual species and\ntheir genera, even and odd, i.e. between subordinate and superordinate\nuniversals, as well as between numbers and things, i.e. between types\nand tokens, e.g. four and four pebbles. Moreover, the reference in\nFragment 5 to things \u201cgiving signs\u201d of numbers is\n\u201cthe first recorded attempt in the history of metaphysics at\ncoining a term for [the relation between a particular and a\nuniversal]\u201d(Mourelatos 2006, 66). \n\nBurkert argues that Philolaus\u2019 appeal to number has little to do\nwith the rigorous mathematics that was being developed in the work of\nhis contemporaries Hippocrates of Chios and Theodorus of Cyrene. It is\ninstead a manifestation of the Pythagorean number mysticism, which can\nbe found in the acusmata, the oral apothegms, many of which\nprobably go back to Pythagoras himself (1972a, 465 ff.). Burkert sees\nevidence that Philolaus was not interested in rigorous mathematics in\nthe mathematically nonsensical account of music in Fr. 6b and\ntestimonium A26 (1972a, 394\u2013400) as well as in what might be the\nuse of mathematics for astrological purposes in A14 (1972a,\n349\u2013350).\u00a0 There are, however, independent reasons for\ndoubting the authenticity of these texts (Huffman 1993, 364\u2013374\nand 381\u2013391). Moreover, the mathematics of the surely authentic\nFr. 6a is above reproach, and Aristotle clearly presents the interest\nin number displayed by fifth-century Pythagoreans as the result of\ntheir training in rigorous mathematics (Metaph. 985b23 ff.;\ncf. Iamblichus, Comm. Math. Sc. 78.8\u201318). Fragments 4\nand 5 suggest that Philolaus\u2019 program was to discover the\nnumbers and numerical relations that govern the phenomena which we\nobserve, and Fr. 6a suggests that the whole-number ratios which govern\nmusical scales served as the model of the kind of mathematical account\nwhich should be supplied for all phenomena. In identifying numerical\nrelations as the basis for knowledge Philolaus may in part be\nresponding to Parmenides\u2019 strictures on what constitutes a\nproper object of thought. Mathematical relationships certainly fit a\nnumber of the characteristics of a proper object of thought as set out\nby Parmenides in Fr. 8, e.g., they are ungenerated, imperishable, and\nunchangeable. Philolaus does not provide many further specific\nexamples of mathematical relations controlling phenomena, which is not\nsurprising given the scientific capabilities of the time. Indeed, the\nfact that the fragments and testimonia are not full of facile\nequations between numbers and phenomena once again suggests that\nPhilolaus was not simply interested in symbolic connections between\nnumbers and things and that Philolaus was looking for connections that\nwere scientifically verifiable, as in the case of the ratios that\ngovern musical intervals. Moreover, Greek usage shows that\n\u201chaving number\u201d need not indicate just a simple one to one\nrelation between a number and things but can also have a general sense\nindicating that something is constituted by an ordered plurality or\nrelations between ordered pluralities (Huffman 1993: 175). The musical\nscale is one example but the alphabet may be another so that in\nPhilolaus\u2019 epistemology science may involve a classification and\nsystematization of a subject that has similarities to Plato\u2019s\ncollection and division (Graham 2014: 55). His successor in the\nPythagorean tradition, Archytas of Tarentum, appears to have adopted\nand been even more successful in carrying out Philolaus\u2019 project\nof accounting for things in the phenomenal world in terms of\nnumber. In some cases, however, Philolaus may have been content to\naccept similarities between the properties of number and the\nproperties of things. Aristotle reports that the Pythagoreans\nidentified individual numbers with certain concepts, e.g., the number\nfour is associated with justice (Metaph. 985b29), evidently\nbecause it is the first square number (cf. the English expression\n\u201ca square deal\u201d). It is not certain that this is a\nreference to Philolaus, but, when Aristotle says that the\ncounter-earth was introduced into the Pythagorean astronomical system\nin order to bring the number of bodies orbiting the central fire up to\nthe perfect number ten, this must apply to Philolaus, since the\nastronomical system described belongs to him (see 4.2 below). Since\nthe world of numbers is ordered in tens, the cosmos too must parallel\nthis order. (For further analysis of Philolaus\u2019 use of\nmathematics see Huffman 1988 and 1993, 54\u201377.) Zhmud (2016)\nargues that, while Philolaus and the early Pythagoreans had some\ninterest in the number symbolism that is found in many cultures, they\ndid not engage in arithmology, which focuses on the special properties\nof the first ten numbers. Certainly it is true that there is no\nevidence for anything as elaborate as the the later arithmological\ntreatises such as the Theologumena Arithmeticae. However, in\norder to deny any special significance for the numbers from one to ten\nin Philolaus one has to dismiss clear Aristotelian evidence and\nPhilolaus\u2019 own use of four psychic faculties and ten bodies\nrotating around the central fire. \n\nThere is no evidence that Philolaus thought that numbers had a\nmetaphysical status independent of the objects which they describe\n(for the contrary view, i.e. that Philolaus thought that the abstract\nwas prior to the concrete, see Netz 2005: 87\u201388). Aristotle\nemphasizes that the Pythagoreans differed from Plato in not separating\nnumbers from things (e.g. Metaph. 987b27\u20139), and Plato\nconfirms this interpretation with his criticism of the Pythagoreans on\nthe grounds that they looked for numbers in things rather than\nfocusing on numbers in themselves (R. 531c). On the other\nhand, Aristotle\u2019s assertion that the Pythagoreans thought that things\nwere numbers or that they were made of numbers is also not supported\nby the fragments of Philolaus. When describing the components of\nthings in the world, Philolaus always talks in terms of limiters and\nunlimiteds and never asserts that things are made or arise from\nnumbers (cf. Fr. 1). In the surviving fragments, number is only\nexplicitly introduced to solve epistemological problems. It is true,\nhowever, that Philolaus\u2019 third metaphysical principle,\n\u201charmonia,\u201d is a \u201cfitting together\u201d of\nlimiters and unlimiteds in accordance with number. Number thus does\nplay a metaphysical role in defining the essence of things, but there\nis no indication that it is the material out of which they are made.\nAristotle\u2019s assertion that the Pythagoreans thought that things were\nnumbers is best understood as his own interpretation of what\nPhilolaus\u2019 system amounted to (Huffman 1993, 57\u201364; see Schibli\n1996 for a defense of Aristotle\u2019s assertion as historically accurate).\nAristotle may well have thought that if numbers are what give us\nknowledge of things, then, in Aristotelian terms, they are the essence\nof things and hence that, in a sense, things are numbers. Philolaus\nappears to have thought that things were composed of unlimiteds such\nas material stuffs and structural features such as shapes; number\ndescribes the harmonia or fitting together that defines how the\nlimiters and unlimited were combined and hence give us the\n\u201cformula\u201d of the thing in question. There is no evidence\nthat he addressed the metaphysical status of the numbers themselves.\n\n4. Cosmogony and Cosmology\n4.1 The Birth of the Cosmos\n\nFragment 7 is the beginning of Philolaus\u2019 account of the coming to be\nof the cosmos:\n\nThe first thing fitted together, the one in the center of the sphere,\nis called the hearth.\n\n\nAs we would expect from Fragment 1, the world begins with a fitting\ntogether. Fragment 1 also indicates that the fitting together should\ninvolve a limiter and an unlimited. What is fitted together in\nFragment 7 is \u201cthe one in the center of the sphere,\u201d which\nis then called \u201cthe hearth.\u201d From the testimony regarding\nPhilolaus\u2019 astronomical system (see 4.2 below) it is clear that what\nis in the center of Philolaus\u2019 cosmos is the central fire, and surely\nit is the central fire that is called the hearth in Fragment 7. What\nare the limiter and the unlimited from which the central fire is put\ntogether? Fire is the obvious choice as the unlimited element, and it\nis limited by being placed at the center of a sphere. Aristotle tells\nus that the next step was for the nearest part of the unlimited to be\ndrawn in (Metaph. 1091a17), and elsewhere he specifies that\nit is time, breath and the void, which are drawn in from the unlimited\n(Arist., Fr. 201). Evidently then Philolaus first envisaged the\nemergence of a sphere with a fire at its center. As in most\nPresocratic cosmologies, the cosmos is surrounded by an unlimited\nexpanse, and Philolaus\u2019 central fire draws in time, breath and void\nfrom that expanse. Each of these three is itself an unlimited, a\ncontinuum not yet limited in any way. Like many other Presocratics\nPhilolaus drew an analogy between the birth of the cosmos and the\nbirth of a human being. At birth the human embryo, which is hot,\nbreathes in cooling air just as the central fire draws in cooling\nbreath from the unlimited. It may be that the interaction of hot fire\nand cold breath was thought to generate the other prominent stuffs in\nthe world such as earth and water. Void serves to distinguish\nindividual things from each other spatially (Arist., Fr. 201); bits of\nthe central fire were perhaps separated off to form the sun, stars and\nplanets. Time provides the temporal continuum in which the cosmos can\ndevelop and according to which the periods of the planets can be\nmeasured (see Zhmud 1998 for doubts that time should be included in\nthe cosmology but note that Aristotle refers to time outside the\ncosmos not only in Fr. 201 but also at De Caelo 279a12,\nalthough without specifically mentioning the Pythagoreans). Some have\nargued that this cosmogony does not distinguish breath and void, since\nthey are drawn in together, and hence that at least this element of\nthe cosmogony is archaic and dates before Philolaus, since it must\nantedate Anaxagoras, who first made the distinction (Kahn 2001, 37).\nBreath and void are listed separately, however, along with time as\nthree things drawn in, and there is no obvious reason to assume that\nthe first two are being identified. Moreover, breath and void serve\ndifferent functions in the cosmogony (cooling and the spatial\ndifferentiation of objects), so that it appears more likely that they\nare not being equated and that Philolaus developed the cosmogony after\nvoid and air had been first distinguished by Anaxagoras and\nEmpedocles. Fragment 17 provides us with the only further evidence for\nPhilolaus\u2019 cosmogony, asserting again that the cosmos began to come to\nbe at the middle and adding that it developed symmetrically around the\nmiddle. The end of the cosmogony is the astronomical system described\nin section 4.2 below, in which ten heavenly bodies including the earth\nencircle the central fire.\n\nThere is considerable controversy about the role of number in this\ncosmogony. Some scholars argue that the generation of the cosmos is\nalso the generation of numbers and that the central fire is the number\none and other heavenly bodies are identified with other numbers, e.g.,\nthe sun is seven (Kahn 2001, 28; Schibli 1996). Thus, in Fragment 7,\nwhen Philolaus refers to \u201cthe one in the center of the\nsphere,\u201d he is not referring simply to the central fire as the\nfirst unity of limiter and unlimited but also to the number one. The\nstrongest support for this view is Aristotle\u2019s assertion that the\nPythagoreans \u201cclearly state that the one was constructed\u2026\nand then that the nearest part of the unlimited was drawn in\u201d\n(Metaph. 1091a15 ff.). Aristotle is complaining about the\nabsurdity of supposing that there can be a generation of eternal\nthings such as numbers, and he appears to be taking Fr. 7 as a clear\nstatement by the Pythagoreans that the number one is generated. The\ndifficulty with accepting this view is that it seems unintelligible to\nsay that the central fire and the number one are the same thing. It is\nquite plausible to assume that there is an analogy between\nthe central fire as the first thing in the cosmos and the number one\nas the first of the numbers, but the claim is that the number one is\nidentical with the central fire, and it would follow that the number\none is a large fire at the center of the cosmos surrounded by ten\nheavenly bodies. The context of Aristotle\u2019s assertion that the number\none was constructed shows, moreover, that there was considerable\ncontroversy as to whether or not the Pythagoreans were to be\ninterpreted in this way and that Aristotle is taking sides in a\ndebate; he says that \u201cit is not necessary to doubt\u201d his\nassertion, which implies that some have indeed doubted it. \u00a0The\nevidence he cites for his own position appears to be precisely Fr. 7,\nand there seems to have been little clear evidence on the issue;\nAristotle complains that the Pythagoreans do not say of what the\nnumber one is composed and suggests planes, surfaces and seeds as\npossibilities. It thus does not appear that Aristotle was drawing on\nany other more explicit statement than what we find in Fr. 7, and his\nremarks indicate that the interpretation of Fr. 7 was controversial\neven in his own time. None of the other fragments of Philolaus equate\nnumbers with things in this way, and Fr. 5 asserts that things\n\u201cgive signs of\u201d or \u201cpoint to\u201d numbers rather\nthan that they are identical with numbers (see section 3 above). This\nevidence suggests that in Fr. 7 Philolaus is not asserting that the\nnumber one was generated but is instead describing the generation of\nthe first unity of limiter and unlimited, the central fire (Huffman\n1993, 202\u2013215; followed by Zhmud 2012: 400).\n4.2 Astronomical System\n\nPhilolaus\u2019 astronomical system is famous as the first to move the\nearth from the center of the universe and make it an orbiting planet\ninstead. Copernicus referred to Philolaus as his precursor in the\npreface to his De Revolutionibus (see Kahn 2001, 26 for\nreferences). Unlike Copernicus, however, Philolaus did not replace the\ngeocentric with a heliocentric universe. The central fire rather than\nthe sun is at the center of Philolaus\u2019 cosmos. The heavenly bodies are\narranged in ten concentric circles around this central fire. Beginning\nfrom the outside, the fixed stars come first, then the five planets,\nthe sun, the moon, the earth and a mysterious counter-earth. The\nsystem can account for the basic phenomena with elegant simplicity.\nThe fixed stars serve as the backdrop against which the other heavenly\nbodies move. All of the bodies have only one circular motion around\nthe central fire, from west to east. The moon completes its orbit in\nabout a month, the sun in a year and each of the planets has its own\nperiod of revolution. Thus, bodies move more slowly, the farther\nremoved they are from the central fire,and the fixed stars probably\ndid not move at all. These motions account for the basic apparent\nmovement of the sun, moon and planets through the zodiac, although\nthere is no attempt to explain more sophisticated planetary phenomena\nsuch as retrograde motion, where the planet appears to stop and move\nbackward before continuing its progress through the zodiac. Retrograde\nmotion was only first addressed almost a century after Philolaus by\nEudoxus. The earth has by far the fastest motion, completing a circuit\nof the central fire in 24 hours. It is the motion of the earth that\naccounts for the apparent daily motion of the sun across the sky and\nhence for night and day. The much faster moving earth, which rotates\non its axis so as to keep our side always turned away from the central\nfire and counter-earth (see below), leaves the sun behind so that day\nlasts as long as the earth is facing the sun, and night occurs when\nthe earth turns away from the sun as it moves around the central\nfire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system is the result of a combination of a priori\nprinciples and reliance on observation. Philolaus is the first to\nincorporate all five planets commonly known in antiquity into an\nastronomical scheme in the correct order, which indicates that he was\naware of the most up-to-date astronomical data (Eudemus as cited in\nSimplicius, in De Caelo 471.4; Huffman 1993, 260; Zhmud 2012:\n336\u20137 thinks that Eudemus is referring to an earlier Pythagorean\nsystem). On the other hand, there are a number of features that appear\nto be explained by appeal to a priori principles of order.\nThus, moving the earth from the center of the universe did not serve\nto explain astronomical data better. There is no explicit reason given\nfor moving the earth; Aristotle reports that some others (Platonists?;\nsee Kingsley 1995, 175\u201380) thought it should be moved because\nfire was thought to be a \u201cbetter\u201d element than earth and\nhence to belong at the center of the cosmos, which is a position of\nhonor (Arist., De Caelo 293b2). We are explicitly told that\nthe Pythagoreans accepted one of the premises of this argument, that\nthe center is the most important part of the cosmos (Arist., De\nCaelo 293b2\u20133), and it is likely that the whole argument\nshould be assigned to Philolaus (Huffman 2007, 76\u201380). This is\nconsistent with the evidence of Frs. 7 and 17, which clearly indicate\nthat the cosmogony began in the center. Philolaus may have assigned\nfire the position of honor, because of the analogy with human birth,\nsince he argued that the human embryo develops from the hot (see 5.3\nbelow). The case of the counter-earth is more complicated. Aristotle\nsuggests that it was introduced for a priori reasons: to\nraise the number of heavenly bodies around the central fire from nine\nto ten, which the Pythagoreans regarded as the perfect number (Arist.,\nMetaph. 986a8\u201312; on the other hand Zhmud 2012:407\nargues that the number ten had no particular significance for the\nPythagoreans). Some scholars have objected that, if we count the\ncentral fire, the introduction of the counter earth makes eleven\nbodies in Philolaus\u2019 system (Burch 1954, 284; Kingsley 1995, 174); the\nancient evidence consistently talks in terms of bodies arranged or\nmoving around the central fire, however, and obviously the\ncentral fire cannot be counted as one of these (Aetius 2.7.7; Arist.,\nFr. 203 and Metaph. 986a10), so that Aristotle\u2019s explanation\nretains considerable plausibility (Burch 1954 suggests that the\ncounter-earth was introduced as a counter-weight to the earth, so that\nthe center of gravity of the cosmos would coincide with the spatial\ncenter, but there is no evidence that Philolaus had the concept of a\ncenter of gravity). On the other hand, Aristotle also comments that\nthe counter-earth was introduced to explain lunar eclipses (De\nCaelo 293b18\u201325). Graham has recently made a convincing case that\nthe counter-earth could in fact account for eclipses of the moon at\ndawn and dusk, which otherwise would be inexplicable on Philolaus\u2019\nmodel (Graham 2015, see also Graham 2014: 57\u201360). Graham speculates\nthat the term for counter-earth in Greek (antichthon), may\nrefer to the counter-earth\u2019s \u201ctaking the place\u201d\n(anti) of the earth in accounting for these lunar eclipses,\nwhich cannot be explained by the interposition of the earth (Graham\n2015: 229). Thus, one of the main features of Philolaus\u2019 system that\nhad been thought to show its non-scientific character, may, in fact,\nbe motivated by an attempt to make the system better explain the\nphenomena. The doxography also assigns the counter earth to the\nPythagorean Hicetas (DK 50A2; cf. Mansfeld 2010a: 90\u201393). The\nfixed stars do not literally move in Philolaus\u2019 system but they, like\nthe planets, sun and moon, have an apparent diurnal movement caused by\nthe motion of the earth. Even Philolaus\u2019 basic assumption that the\ncosmos is spherical (Frs. 7 and 17) may be based on Parmenides\u2019 a\npriori arguments that reality is similar to a sphere in\nperfection (Fr. 8.42\u201344).There is no explicit statement about\nthe shape of the earth in Philolaus\u2019 system and some have supposed it\nto be flat (Burch 1954: 272\u2013273). Analogy with the cosmos\nsuggests that it was spherical as well and several of Aristotle\u2019s\ndescriptions of the Philolaic system show that it was (Dicks 1970:\n72\u201373). Philolaus appears to have believed that there was also\nfire at the periphery of the cosmic sphere and that the sun was a\nglass-like body which transmitted the light and heat of this fire to\nthe earth, an account of the sun which shows connections to\nEmpedocles; Philolaus also posited a great year of 59 years in which\nthe lunar and solar cycles were reconciled (Huffman 1993, 266\u201370\nand 276\u2013279). Philolaus\u2019 great year may be connected to the\ndoctrine of the periodic return of all things, which Dicaearchus\nassigns to the Pythagoreans (Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras\n19), which may be in turn a generalization of reincarnation (Riedweg\n2005, 63). \n\nAs in the case of Philolaus\u2019 cosmogony, there is considerable\ncontroversy about the precise nature of Philolaus\u2019 astronomy. The\na priori features, as well as other testimonia stating that\nPhilolaus believed that the moon was inhabited by creatures fifteen\ntimes more powerful than those on the earth (Aetius 2.30.1 = DK 44\nA20), have suggested to some that Philolaus\u2019 system is largely a\nfantasy and has nothing to do with empirical astronomy (Furley 1987,\n58). Burkert argues, moreover, that the apparent coherence of the\nastronomical system is destroyed, because the fixed stars, which serve\nas the backdrop for the motions of the heavenly bodies described\nabove, were not in fact stationary but moved with the fastest motion\nso that, without a fixed backdrop, the whole system dissolves into\nchaos (1972a, 340); he argues that Philolaus\u2019 astronomy is primarily\nof mythological and religious significance (1972a, 348). However, more\nrecent assessments argue that Philolaus\u2019 astronomical system was a\nserious attempt to account for the phenomena and the most successful\nsuch attempt of his time (Huffman 1993: 231\u2013288; Graham 2015). The\ntext on which Burkert relied to conclude that the fixed stars have the\nfastest motion is, in fact, part of a speculative reconstruction of\nthe doctrine of the harmony of the spheres by a later Greek\ncommentator, Alexander of Aphrodisias, and not a description of\nPhilolaus\u2019 system. Nor need speculation\nabout the inhabitants of the moon indicate that the system is\nfantastical, since such staid Presocratic rationalists as Anaxagoras\nalso argued that the moon was inhabited (see D.L. II 8 and DK 59 A77).\nPerhaps the strongest reason for believing that Philolaus\u2019\nastronomical system was at least in part an attempt to explain the\nphenomena rather than just of religious and mythological significance\nis that other thinkers made objections to the system on empirical\ngrounds, and Philolaus responded to those criticisms in ways that\nattempted to show that his system could explain or \u201csave\u201d\nthe phenomena. Thus an obvious objection to the system is that we\nnever observe the central fire at the center of the universe.\nPhilolaus explained this by supposing that the earth rotates once on\nits axis as it orbits the central fire, so that our side of the earth\nis always turned away from the central fire and hence we never see it.\nThis is also why we never see the counter earth, which is evidently\nsupposed to move at the same speed as the earth. An objection to the\nmoving earth was raised on the grounds that the parallax produced by\nits movement from one side to the other of the central fire would\ncause the sun, moon and planets to appear to move in ways in which\nthey do not. Philolaus evidently argued that the diameter of the\nearth\u2019s orbit was so small relative to the distance to the other\nheavenly bodies that the parallax effects would be negligible (De\nCaelo 293b25\u201330). It is not clear that this solves the\nproblem, but if the system is solely of mythic or religious\nsignificance it is odd that other thinkers, including Aristotle,\ntreated the system as if it were supposed to be consistent with the\nphenomena, and even more surprising that Philolaus tried to defend the\nsystem by showing that it was consistent with those phenomena.\nMoreover, as mentioned above, Graham has recently shown that the\ncounter-earth is not introduced just for a priori reasons but\nserves to give the most sophisticated account of lunar eclipses of the\ntime (Graham 2015).\n\nComparison between the cosmology of the oral sayings ascribed to\nPythagoras (the acusmata) and Philolaus\u2019s cosmos shows that\nPhilolaus\u2019 system represents the transition from a cosmology that is\nprimarily mythical to one that is primarily rational and scientific\n(Huffman 2013a). It remains possible that, while the system is\nintended to save the phenomena, some of its features may retain\nreligious significance as well; some have argued that the\ncounter-earth might be connected to a realm common in folklore where\neverything is \u201ccounter\u201d to our world, a realm that often\nhas connections to the world of the dead, Hades (Burkert 1972a,\n347\u20138; Kingsley 1995, 186\u20137), but there are not good\nparallels for such a conception of Hades in the Greek tradition. Kingsley argues that the central fire is to be\nequated with Tartarus, a region even below Hades in Greek myth, and\nthat the introduction of the counter earth and central fire is largely\ninspired by interpretation of Homer\u2019s description of Hades and\nTartarus as below the earth; Aristotle attests that the Pythagorean\nname for the central fire was  Dios phylak\u00ea, which\nKingsley translates as \u201cprison of Zeus,\u201d which would\naccord with Tartarus\u2019 function as the prison in which the Titans as\nwell as humans damned to punishment were kept (1995, 183 ff.). The\ntext on which Kingsley relies (Anatolius, On the Decad 6.13\nHeiberg) does not mention Philolaus by name, however, and is not, in\nfact, likely to be referring to Philolaus.\nMoreover, Philolaus calls the central fire \u201cthe hearth,\u201d\nwhose positive connotations as the religious center of the house and\nstate are hard to reconcile with its being the place of punishment,\nTartarus. In addition, parallels show that, in the fifth and fourth\ncentury, the name  Dios phylak\u00ea refers to a garrison\nthat guards Zeus or his palace rather than to a prison (Plato,\nProtagoras 321d). In mythical terms it thus appears that\nPhilolaus conceived of the central fire as the fire that Zeus kept\nguarded in his palace and that Prometheus stole and gave to humanity.\nPhilolaus\u2019 cosmogony, in which the central fire draws in void and thus\nseparates off parts of fire and spreads them to the rest of the cosmos\nthus replicates Prometheus\u2019 theft in naturalistic terms. This\nconnection to myth is confirmed by Plato\u2019s description of Philolaus\u2019\nmetaphysical system as hurled down from the gods to men by some\nPrometheus (Philebus 16c), but it is hard to know what\nreligious significance Philolaus saw in the myth (see Huffman 2007 for a response to Kingsley\u2019s points). \n\nBetegh (2014: 162\u20136) has recently argued that while Philolaus\u2019 system\ndoes make sense as a contribution to the tradition of rational\nPresocratic cosmology it at the same time incorporates and\nreinterprets elements of the religious tradition concerning the\nhearth. Thus, the hearth was the center of the household and putting a\nhearth at the center of the cosmos suggested that it was analogous to\nthe household. The ritual by which the newborn child was carried\naround the hearth to introduce it into the household is now paralleled\nby the planets motion around the central fire. Moreover, Betegh argues\nthat the Orphic tradition represented by the Derveni papyrus shows a\nsimilar tendency to give a new religious relevance to concepts derived\nfrom natural philosophy. He also argues that there are striking\nsimilarities between the cosmological theories of the author of the\nDerveni papyrus and Philolaus, partcularly in the role of fire. At the\nsame time it is noteworthy that whereas the Derveni author presents a\ndemiurgic mind as ordering the cosmos, Philolaus never explains what\nbrought limiters and unlimiteds together to form the cosmos (on this\nlack of an efficient cause see also Graham 2014: 65\u20136). \n5. Psychology\n5.1 Psychic Faculties\n\nFragment 13 presents Philolaus\u2019 account of psychic faculties:\n\nThe head [is the seat] of intellect, the heart of soul\n(psych\u00ea) and sensation, the navel of rooting and first\ngrowth, the genitals of the sowing of seed and generation. The brain\n[contains] the origin of man, the heart the origin of animals, the\nnavel the origin of plants, the genitals the origin of all (living\nthings). For all things both flourish and grow from seed.\n\n\nPhilolaus thus recognizes four distinct psychic faculties. He makes a\nclear distinction between intellect (nous), which is limited\nto human beings, and perception, which animals possess as well. He has\nno word for the soul as a whole and uses psych\u00ea, which\nserves this function in Plato and Aristotle, for the psychic functions\nshared by humans and animals. Some have argued that for Philolaus\npsych\u00ea only meant \u201clife,\u201d a common use in\nthe fifth century (Burkert 1972, 270). However, since plants are alive\nand psych\u00ea is not assigned to them, \u201clife\u201d\nis not a good translation. Parallels in Herodotus suggest that for\nPhilolaus psych\u00ea was the seat of emotions and desires,\nwhich was closely connected to perception (Huffman 2009). The third\npsychic faculty is responsible for nutrition and growth and the fourth\ngoverns generation and the sowing of seed. This hierarchy of four\nfaculties is strikingly associated with the hierarchy of living beings\n(human, animal, plant) as well as a hierarchy of parts of the body\n(head, heart, navel, genitals). In identifying the head as the seat of\nintellect, Philolaus is siding with his fellow townsman, Alcmaeon,\nagainst those like Empedocles who championed the heart. He goes beyond\nthis controversy to locate each faculty in a part of the body and thus\nanticipates a similar attempt by Plato to assign psychic faculties to\nregions of the body in the Timaeus. Philolaus makes a\nsignificant advance over earlier Presocratics by making a firm\ndistinction between thinking and perception. His systematization of\npsychic faculties goes beyond anything found in his predecessors and\nis the recognizable precursor of Aristotle\u2019s distinction between the\nfaculties for nutrition, appetite, sensation, movement and thought\n(de An. 414a31\u20132).\nRiedweg notes that three of the seats of the psychic faculties (brain,\nheart and genitals) in animals are forbidden to be eaten in the\nacousmata, so that it may be that a connection can be seen\nhere between scientific and religious strands in Pythagoreanism (2005,\n110).\n5.2 Soul as a Harmony\n\nMacrobius (5th century AD) is the only ancient source to attribute to\nPhilolaus the doctrine that the soul is a harmony (DK 44 A23). It is not clear that this ascription is based on\nanything in Philolaus\u2019 book, moreover, and it may just be a conclusion\nbased on the espousal of the doctrine by Simmias, who is presented as\na pupil of Philolaus, in Plato\u2019s Phaedo (86b5 ff.). The\ndoctrine as presented in the Phaedo may be Plato\u2019s invention\nbased on several Presocratic sources (Mansfeld 2010b: 183\u2013188).\nHowever, since Philolaus believed that all things were either\nlimiters, unlimiteds or harmonious combinations of limiters and\nunlimiteds, it is not implausible that he would have regarded soul as\nsuch a harmony of limiter and unlimited. In Fr. 13 soul\n(psych\u00ea) is the center of emotions and desires, is\nassociated with sense perception, and has its seat in the heart (see\n5.1 above). Sedley argues that Philolaus\u2019 embryology (see 6.1 below)\nsuggests that a body is first ensouled when the heat (an unlimited) of\nthe embryo was cooled, and hence limited, by breath. The soul can thus\nbe viewed as a harmony of these and other opposites, which is the view\nthat Simmias presents in the Phaedo (Sedley 1995,\n22\u20136). In the Phaedo, however, the view that the soul\nis a harmony of parts of the body is shown to be in conflict with its\nimmortality. Some have thus thought that Philolaus did not believe in\nthe immortality of the soul or transmigration (see now McKirahan 2016). It is more likely, however, that he regarded the\npsych\u00ea, which was the center of desires and emotions\nlocated in the heart and shared with animals, as a harmony of its own\nmaterial elements. This may have been drawn in with the first breath\nof the infant and from its seat in the heart it may have served as the\ncommand center which establishes the harmony of hot and cold which\nmakes the body ensouled. After the body loses its harmony and dies,\nthis command center soul survives to transmigrate into the hearts of\nother animals and men. If the psych\u00ea was the\ntransmigrating soul for Philolaus, it follows that he did not think\nthat humans were reborn as plants, since according to Fr. 13 plants do\nnot have a psych\u00ea. Moreover, it would only be the human\ncharacter as constituted by emotions and desires that transmigrates\nand not human intellect, since according to Fr. 13\npsych\u00ea does not include intellect (Huffman 2009; for a critique see Palmer 2018).\n6. Medical Theories\n6.1 Embryology\n\nWe would never have known that Philolaus had contributed to medical\ntheory if not for the papyrus known as the Anonymus\nLondinensis, which is in part based on the history of medicine\nwritten in the late fourth century BC by Aristotle\u2019s pupil Meno (DK 44\nA27\u20138; Huffman 1993, 289\u2013306). Philolaus is one of twenty\nthinkers whose views on the causes of disease are presented in the\npapyrus, and the relatively detailed presentation of Philolaus\u2019 views\nsuggests that Meno had access to his book. Philolaus is included among\nthose thinkers who argue that diseases arise from the elements which\nconstitute the body, so that the section on Philolaus begins with his\naccount of the constitution of the human body, which is in effect his\naccount of the nature of the embryo and newborn infant. Philolaus is\nunusual in arguing that the embryo is composed of just one element,\nthe hot, and has no cold in it. The embryo must be hot because both\nsperm and the womb, in which the sperm is deposited, are hot.\nImmediately upon birth, our bodies, which were too hot before, draw in\ncooling breath, which is then sent out again \u201clike a\ndebt.\u201d Thus, respiration suggests that the cool air which is\ndrawn in was originally something foreign to the body, which must be\npaid back to the source from which it is drawn. The limitation of the\nbody\u2019s innate heat by cooling breath may be the process by which the\nbody becomes ensouled (see 5.2 above). There is a clear analogy\nbetween the embryo, constituted solely of the hot, breathing in\ncooling air and the central fire drawing in breath from the unlimited\nin the early stages of Philolaus\u2019 cosmogony (see 4.1).\n\nThe evidence for Philolaus\u2019 embryology discussed above (DK 44\nA27\u201328) does suggest that he, like Anaxagoras, believed that\nonly the male contributed seed and that the female was simply the\nplace in which the seed was sown. Some scholars have gone further and\nargued that Philolaus subscribed to the view that the seed arose from\nthe brain and the spinal marrow and had hot breath in it, which\nconveyed soul to the child (Leitao 2012: 29\u201330). However, this\ninterpretation is based on Diogenes Laertius 8.28, which does not\nmention Philolaus by name and in fact derives from the Pythagorean\nMemoirs excerpted by Alexander Polyhistor. This treatise is\nbelieved by most scholars to belong to the later pseudo-Pythagorean\ntradition and hence is not good evidence for Philolaus\u2019 beliefs\n(Burkert 1972: 53). Moreover, the report contradicts the genuine\nfragments of Philolaus in a number of ways. Fragment 13 of Philolaus\nasserts that semen comes from the genitals not the brain and A27\nclearly suggests that seed is composed just of the hot, says nothing\nof its origin in the brain, and indicates that breath does not enter\nthe child through the male seed but only when it is drawn in upon\nbirth. \n6.2 Disease\n\nThe Anonymus Londinensis then tells us that Philolaus\nexplained disease in terms of three factors: bile, blood and phlegm.\nIt is surprising that no mention is made of the basic constituent of\nthe body, the hot, since Philolaus is presented as one of the thinkers\nwho explains disease in terms of the constituents of the body (see 6.1\nabove). It may well be, however, that bile, blood and phlegm were all\nregarded as hot, since blood and bile were typically regarded as hot,\nand we are explicitly told that Philolaus argued that phlegm was hot,\nalthough it was typically regarded as cold (Lloyd 1963, 120).\nMoreover, excesses and deficiencies of heat, cold and nutriment are\nalso said to be causes of disease. It would appear then that health\ndepends on appropriate cooling of the natural heat of the body and\nthat bile, blood and phlegm cause disease insofar as they are not\nconstituted properly by the balance of heating and cooling, the\nbalance of which can also be upset by improper nutrition. There are a number of puzzling features in\nPhilolaus\u2019 presentation of the three humours: blood, bile and phlegm\n(Gourevitch 1989, Manetti 1990). Phlegm is said to be constituted from\nombroi, which usually means \u201crain storms,\u201d but\nprobably here means just liquids (Manetti 1990). However, Manetti\u2019s\nsuggestion (1990) that phlegm does not refer to the humour but rather\nmeans \u201cinflammation\u201d is not very likely, since phlegm is\nnot said to be caused by the liquids, which is what we would expect if\nit meant \u201cinflammation\u201d but rather constituted of them.\nPhilolaus\u2019 account of disease may be distorted by the intervention of\nthe author of the Anonymus Londinensis (Manetti 1990). \n7. Importance and Influence\n7.1 Philolaus and Pythagoras: How original is Philolaus?\n\nPythagoras is one of the most famous names in the ancient\nphilosophical tradition, and there is a natural tendency to assume\nthat he was responsible for the most fruitful ideas in the Pythagorean\ntradition. One of the dominant trends in recent scholarship on\nPythagoras, however, is to recognize that his fame grew exponentially\nwith the passage of time and that the early evidence, down to the time\nof Plato and Aristotle, when examined carefully, reveals that\nPythagoras was indeed famous but not as a typical Presocratic\ncosmologist nor as a mathematician/ scientist. In the early tradition Pythagoras is consistently\npresented as a charismatic teacher famous for two things: 1) his\nexpertise on the fate of the soul in the next life as represented in\nthe doctrine of transmigration of souls 2) his founding of a way of\nlife which some people still followed a hundred years after his death.\nThis way of life involved moral and religious teachings that were\nembodied in a series of brief sayings known as acousmata,\nwhich included ritual taboos and dietary restrictions such as the\nfamous prohibition on eating beans (Burkert 1972a, 166\u201392).\nThere is no evidence that Philolaus made any significant contribution\nin these areas. Plato\u2019s suggestion in the Phaedo that\nPhilolaus had something to say about the prohibition against suicide\nis the closest we get to a pronouncement on how to live one\u2019s life. It\nseems most reasonable to assume that he followed, to a greater or\nlesser degree, the Pythagorean life handed down from the time of\nPythagoras, who died some twenty years before Philolaus was born.\nThere are a few hints that he tried to reconcile the mythic and\nreligious side of Pythagoreanism with his own naturalistic explanation\nof the world (see 4.2 and 5.1 above).\n\nOn the other hand, Aristotle always presents the philosophical system\nof limiters and unlimiteds, which placed an emphasis on the role of\nnumber in understanding the cosmos and which included the astronomical\nsystem built around the central fire, as the work of \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans,\u201d whom he dates to the second half of the\nfifth century, at the same time as or a little earlier than the\natomists (e.g. Metaph. 985b23 ff.). This is the philosophical\nsystem that we find in the fragments of Philolaus, and Aristotle\u2019s\ndating fits Philolaus exactly so there can be little doubt that\nPhilolaus was the leading figure among those labeled \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans\u201d by Aristotle. Although some scholars\ncontinue to argue that most of what Aristotle ascribes to \u201cthe\nso-called Pythagoreans\u201dshould be regarded as Pythagoras\u2019 own\nteaching (Riedweg 2005, 77\u201380), Aristotle\u2019s testimony doubly\ndistances Pythagoras himself from the Philolaic system. First,\nAristotle is emphatic that the system dates after the time of\nPythagoras, and second, his expression \u201cso-called\nPythagoreans\u201d is most reasonably understood to suggest that,\nalthough he knows that the name \u201cPythagorean\u201d is often\ngiven to Philolaus and his contemporaries, he can see little reason to\nconnect the philosophical system they espouse to Pythagoras himself.\nThe later tradition also emphasizes Philolaus\u2019 originality in the area\nof cosmology by asserting that he was the first Pythagorean to publish\na work on nature (D. L. 8.85). The testimony of Aristotle and the\nlater tradition is largely confirmed by the content of Philolaus\u2019\nphilosophy. Although the contrast between limit and unlimited is\nimplicit from the beginning of the Presocratic tradition, the first\nexplicit champion of limit is Parmenides, and the attempt to explain\nthe world in terms of a combination of limiters and unlimiteds thus\nmakes most sense as arising after Parmenides has championed limit\n(Huffman 1999). Moreover, the style of argumentation in Fragments\n1\u20136, and particularly Fr. 2, is reminiscent of Parmenides and\nhis successor Melissus (Kahn 2001, 34), so that the central\nmetaphysical system and the arguments for it look very much as if they\nare the original contribution of Philolaus. The same is true of the\nastronomical system built around the central fire, which the later\ntradition assigns to Philolaus and which Aristotle (Metaph.\n986a8 ff.) and Fr. 7 explicitly tie to the philosophy of limiters and\nunlimiteds. Kahn is inclined to regard parts of the cosmogony as going\nback to Pythagoras. He argues that the idea of the cosmos breathing is\narchaic and that it may have been attacked long before Philolaus by\nXenophanes, who pointedly describes his god as not breathing; Kahn\nalso argues that the equivalence between air and void suggests a date\nbefore Anaxagoras (2001, 36\u20137). In section 4.1 above, however,\nreasons have been given to show that the Philolaic system, in fact,\ndistinguishes between air and void and hence once again conforms very\nwell to Philolaus\u2019 date after Anaxagoras. The breathing of the cosmos\nneed not be seen as archaic, since biological analogies are still\nfound in the cosmogony of the atomists (DK 67 A1). Xenophanes\u2019 remark\nis reported in only one testimonium (DK 21 A1) and is not found in any\nof the extant fragments of his book; if it is his, it need not be\ndirected at anything other than general Greek anthropomorphism.\n\nThe question remains whether or not Pythagoras had adumbrated any sort\nof cosmology and what the relation of that cosmology was to Philolaus\u2019\nlater system. It is certainly true that the discovery that the primary\nmusical concords of the octave, fourth and fifth are governed by the\nsimple whole number ratios 2 : 1, 4 : 3 and 3 : 2 occurred before\nPhilolaus. Most of the traditions connecting this discovery to\nPythagoras himself, however, are unreliable; Hippasus is the earliest\nPythagorean connected to a scientific demonstration of these\nphenomena, but the actual discovery probably antedates him and may not\nbe specifically Pythagorean (Huffman 1993, 147\u20138). It is also\ntrue that number plays a significant symbolic role in the\nacousmata that go back to the time of Pythagoras. Thus one of\nthe acousmata asserts that number is the wisest thing\n(Iamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life 82). Pythagoreans took\noaths in the name of Pythagoras as \u201cthe one who gave the\ntetraktys\u201d\u2014tetraktys being a name for\nthe first four numbers, whose total is ten, which was the perfect\nnumber for the Pythagoreans. Our evidence for the oath is late, but\nthe acousmata refer to the tetraktys as \u201cthe\nharmony in which the Sirens sang\u201d (Iamblichus, On the\nPythagorean Life 82), which may indicate an awareness of the role\nof the first four numbers in the whole-number ratios which determine\nthe musical concords. The harmony in which the Sirens sing could be a\nreference to the famous doctrine of the harmony of the spheres,\naccording to which the heavens make music by their motions. The\nacousmata also adumbrate a cosmology which is tied to a\nreligious doctrine of reward and punishment. The planets are described\nas the avenging hounds of the goddess Persephone (Porphyry, Life\nof Pythagoras 41), the sun and the moon are the isles of the\nblessed, where the good may be sent as a reward (Iamblichus, On\nthe Pythagorean Life 82), and thunder is a warning to souls in\nTartarus (Aristotle, Posterior Analytics II, 11 94b33). It\nappears then that Pythagoras had presented a vision of the cosmos\nwhich was ordered according to symbolic numbers and which reinforced\ncertain religious ideas (West 1971, 213\u201318).\nPhilolaus continues in this tradition by arguing that there are ten\ncelestial bodies arranged around the central fire, because ten is the\nperfect number, and also by perhaps endowing some of the parts of his\ncosmos with mythological and religious significance, e.g., by equating\nthe central fire with the fire guarded by Zeus and stolen by\nPrometheus (see 4.2 above). On the other hand Philolaus\u2019 attempt to\nsave astronomical phenomena by including the five planets in correct\norder according to their periods, by giving an explanation of night\nand day and by responding to concerns about how parallax might affect\nthe way the heavenly bodies appear to move has no apparent precedent\nin the cosmology of the acousmata. It would thus appear that\nPythagoras promulgated a cosmology that was largely of mythic and\nreligious significance and that Philolaus, while maintaining some of\nthis religious import, significantly reworked these ideas in order to\nproduce a system that could account for basic astronomical phenomena\n(Huffman 2013). Graham has thus recently argued that Philolaus is not\nthe mere transmitter of the earlier philosophy of Pythagoras but\nrather was the inventor of \u201cPythagorean\u201d philosophy, the\nfigure who brought Pythagoreanism out of the shadowy world of\nPythagorean lore into the light of Greek philosophical conversation\n(Graham 2014: 48).\n7.2 Philolaus and Plato\n\nThere is the possibility that on his first visit to Southern Italy and\nSicily in 388\u20137 Plato met an aged Philolaus in Tarentum (D. L.\nIII 36). This would motivate Plato\u2019s allusion to Philolaus as the\nteacher of Socrates\u2019 interlocutors, Simmias and Cebes, in the\nPhaedo, which scholars have often dated in the years\nimmediately following Plato\u2019s return from Italy. The presentation of\nPhilolaus in the Phaedo is not particularly favorable;\nSocrates supposes that Cebes should have heard something from\nPhilolaus about the prohibition on suicide, but Cebes responds that he\nhas heard nothing clear on the topic from Philolaus, or anyone else.\nPlato may also be criticizing Philolaus when he shows the\ninconsistency between the doctrine that the soul is a harmony and the\nbelief that the soul is immortal (see 6.2 above). On the other hand,\nlate in Plato\u2019s life, in the Philebus, there is evidence that\nPlato had studied Philolaus\u2019 metaphysical system and derived fruitful\ninsights from it. At 16b4 ff. Socrates introduces a philosophical\nmethod which he describes as\n\na gift \u2026 hurled down from the gods to man along with a dazzling\nfire on account of some Prometheus. And the men before our time, since\nthey were better than we are and lived closer to the gods, handed down\nthis report about the things that are in each case said to be, that\nthey are from a one and many and that they have limit and unlimited in\nthemselves by nature.\n\n\nThere are a number of important correspondences between the\ndescription of the method of \u201cthe men before our time\u201d in\nthis and the immediately following passages of the Philebus\nand the fragments of Philolaus, e.g., the postulation of the limit and\nunlimited as basic principles, Plato\u2019s insistence that number is the\nbasis for all inquiring, learning, and teaching (16e; Philolaus, Fr.\n4) and the use of the musical scale as a central example of the\ncombination of limiter and unlimited (17b ff., Philolaus, Fr. 6a).\nThere can be little doubt that Plato has Philolaus in mind, and he may\nbe alluding to Philolaus\u2019 method of archai (Huffman 2001). It\nis clear, however, that Plato is not taking over Philolaus\u2019\nmetaphysical system wholesale but is rather using it as a way of\naddressing problems that have arisen with the theory of forms.\nMeinwald (2002) argues that Plato is either correcting or providing a\nsympathetic reinterpretation of Philolaus\u2019 system, which allows Plato\nto suggest a way in which knowledge of forms may be mathematical. This\nreinterpretation transforms unlimiteds into pairs of opposites, in\nwhich limiters set ratios. This interpretation agrees with Aristotle\u2019s\nclaim that Plato differed from the Pythagoreans in making the\nunlimited a dyad (Metaph. 987b23\u201327). It has been\ncommon to assume that the Prometheus in the passage quoted above is a\nveiled reference to Pythagoras (Hackforth 1958, 21; Gosling 1975, 83).\nYet, as we have seen, Aristotle never associates Pythagoras with this\nmetaphysical scheme, and Plato elsewhere presents Pythagoras as a\nfounder of a way of life and not as a master metaphysician\n(R. 600a\u2013b). Modern scholars may be overreading the passage\nin light of Pythagoras\u2019 fame in the later tradition. Prometheus was\ntraditionally the founder of all human arts through his gift of fire,\nand Plato here supposes that the philosophical method he describes\nmust likewise have been due to some Prometheus, perhaps under the\ninfluence of Philolaus\u2019 own allusion to Prometheus in his cosmology\n(see 4.2 above). There is no need to introduce Pythagoras into the\nstory (Huffman 1999).\n Philolaus\u2019\n metaphysics of limiters and unlimiteds is perfectly intelligible as a\nresponse to the problems raised in the tradition of Presocratic\nmetaphysics (see 2.1 above) and was not a gift either of Prometheus or\nPythagoras. Some have argued that other passages in the\nPhaedo (101b10\u2013104c9) and a passage in the Cratylus\n(401b11\u2013c7) show that Plato was both heavily influenced by and\ncritical of Philolaus (Horky 2013). However, neither Philolaus nor the\nPythagoreans are specifically mentioned in these passages and the\nsupposed connections to Philolaus are nothing like as specific as in\nthe Philebus and too general and indirect to be convincing\n(e.g., the concepts of odd and even in the Phaedo passage\nwere important to Philolaus but hardly limited to him).\n",
