    "main_text": "Kant: Playing with Truth || The Moral Significance of the Aesthetic\n7.2 The Moral Significance of the Aesthetic\n\nWe can now see how Kant thinks that our aesthetic experiences and\njudgments can bridge the gulf between our abstract, intellectual\nunderstanding of the requirements and conditions of morality and a\npalpable, sensuous representation of those requirements and\nconditions. Kant suggests six links between the aesthetic and moral,\nwhich together make palpable the satisfaction of the four conditions\nof the possibility of morality that were noted in the introduction to\nthe present section.\n\n\nFirst, Kant evidently holds that objects of aesthetic experience can\npresent morally significant ideas to us without sacrificing what is\nessential to them as objects of aesthetic response and judgment.  This\nis obvious in the theory of aesthetic ideas, where Kant indeed assumes\nthat works of art always have some morally relevant content. But this\nview takes other forms as well. In fact, Kant maintains that all forms\nof beauty, natural as well as artistic, can be regarded as expressions\nof aesthetic ideas: even natural objects can suggest moral ideas to us\nalthough such suggestion is not the product of any intentional human\nactivity (CPJ, \u00a751, 5:319). In \u201cThe Ideal of\nBeauty,\u201d Kant also maintains that beauty in the human figure can\nbe taken as \u201cthe visible expression of moral ideas, which\ninwardly govern human beings\u201d; here he argues that only human\nbeauty can be taken as a unique standard for beauty, because it is the\nonly form of beauty that can express something absolutely and\nunconditionally valuable, namely the moral autonomy of which humans\nalone are capable. At the same time he holds there is no determinate\nway in which this unique value can be expressed in the human form,\nthus there is always something free in the outward expression in the\nhuman figure of the inner moral value of the human character\n(CPJ, \u00a717, 5:235\u20136).\n\n\nThe second link is Kant\u2019s claim that the aesthetic experience of the\ndynamical sublime is nothing other than a feeling of the power of our\nown practical reason to accept the pure principle of morality and to\nact in accordance with it in spite of all the threats or inducements\nto do otherwise that nature might place in our way. Because the\nexperience of the dynamical sublime so centrally involves an\nintimation of our own capacity to be moral, Kant actually insists that\n\u201cthe sublime in nature is only improperly so called, and should\nproperly be ascribed only to the manner of thinking, or rather its\nfoundation in human nature\u201d (CPJ, \u00a730, 5:280). And\nwhile he does not want to claim that this experience is identical to\nexplicit moral reasoning, but only a \u201cdisposition of the mind\nthat is similar to the moral disposition\u201d (CPJ, General\nRemark following \u00a729, 5:268), he does in at least one place argue\nthat the complex character of the experience of the sublime makes it\nthe best representation in our experience of our moral situation\nitself (CPJ, General Remark following \u00a729, 5:271).\n\n\nHowever, Kant elsewhere argues, third, that there are crucial aspects\nof our moral condition that are symbolized by the beautiful rather\nthan the sublime. He claims that the beautiful is the symbol of the\nmorally good because there are significant parallels between our\nexperience of beauty and the structure of morality.  Indeed, he\ninsists that it is only insofar as the beautiful is the symbol of the\nmorally good that we have any right not merely to predict that under\nideal circumstances others should agree with our appraisals of beauty\nbut actually to demand that they do so (CPJ, \u00a759,\n5:353). Kant adduces \u201cseveral aspects of this analogy,\u201d\nthe most important of which is that\nThe freedom of the imagination (thus of\nthe sensibility of our faculty) is represented in the judging of the\nbeautiful as in accord with the lawfulness of the understanding (in\nthe moral judgment the freedom of the will is conceived as the\nagreement of the latter with itself in accordance with universal laws\nof reason). (CPJ, \u00a759, 5:354)\n\n\nBecause the experience of beauty is an experience\nof the freedom of the imagination in its play with the understanding,\nit can be taken as a palpable symbol of the freedom of the will to\ndetermine itself by moral laws that is necessary for morality but not\nitself something that can be directly experienced. In other words, it\nis the very independence of aesthetic response from direct\ndetermination by concepts, including moral concepts, that makes the\nexperience of beauty an experience of freedom that can in turn\nsymbolize moral freedom. Presumably this can be reconciled with\nKant\u2019s earlier claim that the sublime is the most appropriate symbol\nof morality by observing that while the experience of beauty makes\nthe freedom of the will palpable to us, it is only the mixed\nexperience of the sublime that brings home to feeling that this\nfreedom must often be exercised in the face of resistance offered by\nour own inclinations.\n\n\nKant\u2019s fourth connection between the aesthetic and the ethical lies in\nhis theory of the \u201cintellectual interest\u201d in the\nbeautiful. Here Kant argues that although our basic pleasure in a\nbeautiful object must be independent of any antecedent interest in its\nexistence, we may add a further layer of pleasure to that basic\nexperience if the existence of beautiful objects suggests some more\ngenerally pleasing fact about our situation in the world.  Kant\u2019s\nclaim is that since it is of interest to practical reason that nature\nbe hospitable to its objectives, we take pleasure in any\nevidence that nature is amenable to our objectives, even when those\nare not specifically moral; and the natural existence of beauty is\nsuch evidence, because the experience of beauty is itself an\nunexpected fulfillment of our most basic cognitive\nobjective.\n\n\nKant\u2019s fifth claim is that aesthetic experience is conducive to proper\nmoral conduct itself. In his concluding comment on his analyses of\nboth the beautiful and the sublime he states that \u201cThe beautiful\nprepares us to love something, even nature, without interest; the\nsublime, to esteem it, even contrary to our (sensible) interest\u201d\n(CPJ, General Remark following \u00a729, 5:267), where being\nable to love without any personal interest and to esteem even contrary\nto our own interest are necessary preconditions of proper moral\nconduct. Kant makes a similar point in his later Metaphysics of\nMorals (1797) when he argues that \u201ca propensity to wanton\ndestruction of what is beautiful in inanimate nature,\u201d\neven though we do not owe any moral duties directly to anything other\nthan ourselves and other human beings, nevertheless\nweakens or uproots that feeling in [us] which,\nthough not of itself moral, is still a disposition of sensibility that\ngreatly promotes morality or at least prepares the way for it: the\ndisposition, namely, to love something (e.g., beautiful crystal\nformations, the indescribable beauty of plants) even apart from any\nintention to use it. (Metaphysics of Morals, Doctrine of\nVirtue \u00a717, 6:643; Gregor, p. 564)\n\n\n\nSixth and finally, in the brief \u201cAppendix on the methodology of\ntaste,\u201d Kant suggests that the cultivation or realization of\ncommon standards of taste in a society can be conducive to the\ndiscovery of the more general \u201cart of the reciprocal\ncommunication of the ideas of the most educated part\u201d of a\nsociety \u201cwith the cruder, the coordination of the breadth and\nrefinement of the former with the natural simplicity and originality\nof the latter\u201d (CPJ, \u00a760, 5:356), where this art\nis apparently necessary to the realization of the goal of\n\u201clawful sociability,\u201d or the establishment of a\nstable polity on the basis of principles of justice rather than sheer\nforce. Thus, aesthetic experience can be conducive to the development\nof sound politics as well as personal ethics, although the two are of\ncourse not unconnected, since Kant is a political moralist who\nbelieves that we have a moral duty to establish a just state, not\nmerely a prudential interest in doing so.\n\n\nThese six links between aesthetics and morality satisfy the four\nconditions that need to be met in order to bridge the gulf between\nnature and freedom by making our abstract grasp of the contents and\nconditions of morality palpable to our sensuous nature. In particular,\n(i) the presentation of moral ideas in objects of natural and artistic\nbeauty and especially in beautiful human form itself provides sensuous\nillustration of moral ideas, above all the foundational idea of the\nunconditional value of human freedom itself; (ii) the experiences of\nthe dynamical sublime and of the beautiful in their different ways\nboth confirm our abstract recognition of our own freedom always to\nchoose to do as morality requires; (iii) the intellectual interest in\nthe beautiful provides sensuous confirmation of nature\u2019s amenability\nto our objectives, which is otherwise only a postulate of pure\npractical reason; and (iv) the claims that the experiences of the\nbeautiful and the sublime and the sharing of these feelings among\ndifferent strata of highly diversified societies are conducive to the\nrealization of morality reveal ways in which our natural sensuous\ndispositions can be used as means to the realization of the goal set\nby our purely rational disposition to be moral.\n",
