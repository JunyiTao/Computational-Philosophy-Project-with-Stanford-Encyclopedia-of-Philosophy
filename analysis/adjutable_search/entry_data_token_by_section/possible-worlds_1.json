    "main_text": "Possible Worlds and Modal Logic || Extensionality Lost\n1.1 Extensionality Lost\n\nSince the middle ages at least, philosophers have recognized a\nsemantical distinction between extension and\nintension. The extension of a denoting expression, or\nterm, such as a name or a definite description is its\nreferent, the thing that it refers to; the extension of a predicate is\nthe set of things it applies to; and the extension of a sentence is\nits truth value. By contrast, the intension of an expression is\nsomething rather less definite \u2014 its sense, or\nmeaning, the semantical aspect of the expression that\ndetermines its extension. For purposes here, let us say that a\nlogic is a formal language together with a semantic theory for\nthe language, that is, a theory that provides rigorous definitions of\ntruth, validity, and logical consequence for the\n language.[2]\n A logic is extensional if the truth value of every sentence\nof the logic is determined entirely by its form and the extensions of\nits component sentences, predicates, and terms. An extensional logic\nwill thus typically feature a variety of valid substitutivity\nprinciples. A substitutivity principle says that, if two\nexpressions are coextensional, that is, if they have the same\nextension, then (subject perhaps to some reasonable conditions) either\ncan be substituted for the other in any sentence salva\nveritate, that is, without altering the original sentence's truth\nvalue. In an\n intensional logic,\n the truth values of some sentences are determined by something over\nand above their forms and the extensions of their components and, as a\nconsequence, at least one classical substitutivity principle is\ntypically rendered invalid. \n\nExtensionality is a well known and generally cherished feature of\nclassical propositional and predicate logic. Modal logic, by contrast,\nis intensional. To illustrate: the substitutivity principle for\nsentences tells us that sentences with the same truth value can be\nsubstituted for one another salva veritate. So suppose that\nJohn's only pets are two dogs, Algol and BASIC, say, and consider two\nsimple sentences and their formalizations (the predicates in question\nindicating the obvious English counterparts): \n\n\n\n\nAll John's dogs are mammals: \u2200x(Dx \u2192\nMx).  \n\n\n\n\n\nAll John's pets are mammals: \u2200x(Px \u2192\nMx) \n\n\nAs both sentences are true, they have the same extension. Hence, in\naccordance with the classical substitutivity principle for sentences,\nwe can replace the occurrence of (1) with (2) in the false sentence\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all John's dogs are mammals: \u00ac\u2200x(Dx\n\u2192 Mx)  \n\n\nand the result is the equally false sentence \n\n\n\n\nNot all John's pets are mammals: \u00ac\u2200x(Px\n\u2192 Mx).  \n\n\nHowever, when we make the same substitution in the true sentence \n\n\n\n\nNecessarily, all John's dogs are mammals:\n\u25a1\u2200x(Dx \u2192 Mx), \n\n\nthe result is the sentence \n\n\n\n\n\nNecessarily, all John's pets are mammals:\n\u25a1\u2200x(Px \u2192 Mx),  \n\n\nwhich is intuitively false, as John surely could have had a\nnon-mammalian pet. In a modal logic that accurately represents the\nlogic of the necessity operator, therefore, the substitutivity\nprinciple for sentences will have to fail. \n\nThe same example illustrates that the substitutivity principle for\npredicates will have to fail in modal logic as well. For, according to\nour example, the predicates \u2018D\u2019 and\n\u2018P\u2019 that are true of John's dogs and of John's\npets, respectively, are coextensional, i.e.,\n\u2200x(Dx \u2194 Px). However, while\nsubstituting the latter predicate for the former in (3) results in a\nsentence with the same truth value, the same substitution in (5) does\nnot. \n\nModal logic, therefore, is intensional: in general, the truth value of\na sentence is determined by something over and above its form and the\nextensions of its components. Absent a rigorous semantic theory to\nidentify the source of its intensionality and to systematize\nintuitions about modal truth, validity, and logical consequence, there\nwas little hope for the widespread acceptance of modal logic. \n",
