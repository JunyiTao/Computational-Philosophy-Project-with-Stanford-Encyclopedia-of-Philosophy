    "main_text": "Philosophy of Education || A System of Education\n5.1 A System of Education\n\nJefferson\u2019s educational views are spelled out neatly in four\nbills proposed to the General Assembly of Virginia (1779), in his Bill\nfor Establishing a System of Public Education (1817), in his Rockfish\nGap Report (1818), and in key letters to correspondents\u2014e.g.,\nCarr, Banister, Munford, Adams, Cabell, Burwell, Brazier, and\nBreckinridge.\n\nWhen Jefferson, Pendleton, and Wythe undertook the task of revising\nthe laws of Virginia in 1776, Jefferson drafted four significant\nbills\u2014Bills 79 to 82.\n\n\nI consider 4 of these bills \u2026 as forming a system by which\nevery fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy; and\na foundation laid for a government truly\n republican.[30]\n ([WTJ5]: 44)\n\n\nBill 79 proposed to create wards or hundreds, each of which would have\na school for general education in which \u201creading, writing, and\ncommon arithmetic should be taught\u201d ([BG]). Virginia was to be\nsubdivided in twenty-four districts, each of which would have a school\nfor \u201cclassical learning, grammar, geography, and the higher\nbranches of numerical arithmetic\u201d ([BG]). Bill 80 proposed to\nsecularize William and Mary College and add to its curriculum by\nenlarging its \u201csphere of science\u201d\n ([BWM]).[31]\n Bill 81 proposed to create a public library for Virginia for\nscholars, elected officials, and inquisitive citizens ([BL]). Bill 82,\nthe only bill that would eventually pass (1786), proposed to disallow\nstate patronage of any particular religion ([BR]; [Au]:\n31\u201344).\n\nJefferson made it clear (TJ to George Wythe, 13 Aug. 1786) that Bill\n79\u2014concerning implementation of wards and ward schools\u2014was\n\u201cthe most important bill of our whole code\u201d, as it was the\n\u201cfoundation \u2026 for the preservation of freedom and\nhappiness\u201d in a true republic. It was the key to engendering the\nsort of reforms needed for Jeffersonian republicanism\u2014reforms\naimed at an educated and thriving citizenry. \n\n\nIt is an axiom in my mind that our liberty can never be safe but in\nthe hands of the people themselves, and that too of the people with a\ncertain degree of education,\n\n\nhe says to George Washington (4 Jan. 1786). \u201cWherever the people\nare well-informed, they can be trusted with their own\ngovernment,\u201d he writes to philosopher Richard Price (8 Jan.\n 1789).[32]\n\nYet Jefferson\u2019s trust in the people was not unconditional. He\nnever asserted categorically that government for and of the people\nmust, or even can, work. Experience had shown him that governments in\nwhich officials were not elected by and beholden to the people did not\nwork\u2014i.e., they were ultimately unresponsive to the needs of the\npeople\u2014and so he often called republicanism an\n\u201cexperiment\u201d or \u201cgreat experiment\u201d (TJ to John\nAdams, 28 Feb. 1796, and WTJ5: 484). If citizens\u2019 rights were to\nbe respected and defended and if governors were not to govern in their\nown best interest but as stewards f the citizenry, all citizens needed\na basic education\u2014hence, the indispensability of ward-school\neducation.\n",
