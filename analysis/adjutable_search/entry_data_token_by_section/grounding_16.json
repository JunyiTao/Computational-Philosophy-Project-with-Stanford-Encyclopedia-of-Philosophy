    "main_text": "Interaction with Other Notions || Essence\n4.3 Fundamentality\n\nHow are grounding and fundamentality related? Here we focus on\nfundamentality with respect to facts, as opposed to, say, entity or\ntheory fundamentality. There are two general types of fundamentality,\nrelative and absolute. As for relative fundamentality, the general\nidea is that some facts are more fundamental than others. A simple\ngrounding-theoretic account of relative fundamentality is this: for\neach fact among \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 to be more fundamental\nthan \\([Q]\\) is for \\([P],\\) \\([P'],\\) \u2026 to ground \\([Q]\\).\nTurning to absolute fundamentality, the idea is that some facts are\nfundamental full stop. On one familiar conception of absolute\nfundamentality, to be absolutely fundamental is to enjoy a distinctive\nform of independence (Bennett 2017: Ch. 5). One way for a\nfact to be independent is for it not to be grounded by other facts.\nThis suggests a simple grounding-theoretic account of absolute\nfundamentality: to be absolutely fundamental it to be ungrounded\n(Schaffer 2009).\n\nYou might think that the above account of relative fundamentality\nfails to identify a necessary condition, especially if you assume\nthat, for any two facts, one of them is more fundamental than the\nother or they\u2019re equally fundamental. For example, perhaps\n[There are hydrogen atoms in Phoenix] is more fundamental than [There\nare H2O molecules in Ithaca] even though the former\ndoesn\u2019t ground the latter (Bennett 2017: Ch. 6). (For more\nsophisticated characterizations of relative fundamentality that appeal\nto grounding, see Bennett 2017: Ch. 6 and Werner 2021.)\n\nReturning to absolute fundamentality, you might worry that the above\naccount leaves out an important dimension, specifically the fact that\nthe absolutely fundamental facts are complete in the sense\nthat, since they are the basic building blocks of reality, to describe\nthem is in some sense to provide a description of everything (Tahko\n2018). Note that absolute fundamentality conceived of as involving\nboth independence and completeness seems to capture the notion of an\nunexplained explainer\u2014the absolutely fundamental facts are\nindependent and therefore unexplained, and these facts are complete\nand therefore explain (Bennett 2017: Ch. 5). Looking to the history of\nphilosophy, we see that fundamental entities are regularly invoked as\na means of meeting certain kinds of explanatory demands, demands that\nperhaps only independent entities could meet. This is typically\nevidenced by the arguments from vicious infinite regress that are\ncommonly wielded in defense of them. It\u2019s because we need to\nexplain, for example, why there are any contingent things whatsoever\nthat God must exist and, importantly, if God weren\u2019t the\nterminus point of our regress\u2014because independent\u2014then the\nproblem that God was invoked to solve wouldn\u2019t be solved after\nall.\n\nWith this in mind, we might revise the simple account of absolute\nfundamentality above as follows: to be fundamental is to be a member\nof some collection of facts, F, such that\n\neach fact among F is both ungrounded and grounds some\nfact; and\nfacts among F ground all the grounded facts.\n\n\nWe might wish to add further conditions ensuring that F is\nminimal (there is no proper sub-collection of F that\ngrounds all the grounded facts) and F is\nunique\u2014F is the only collection that satisfies\nthese conditions. Another option is to interpret completeness (or\nunique minimal completeness) as being characteristic but not\ndefinitional of absolute fundamentality (Bennett 2017: Ch. 5).\n(Whether definitional or not, the grounding role that absolutely\nfundamental facts play potentially makes the cost of positing such\nfacts worth paying\u2014see Bliss 2019 for discussion.) Still another\noption for the grounding theorist is to be a pluralist about notions\nof absolute fundamentality, characterizing independence, completeness,\nand perhaps further notions as well such as ineliminability,\ngranting that they might (in special cases) pull apart. (See Raven\n2016 for discussion of ineliminability in this context.)\n",
