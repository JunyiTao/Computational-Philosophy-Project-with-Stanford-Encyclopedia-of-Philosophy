Should the\nstate enact health and safety rules designed to save people from poor\nprivate choices such as eating sugary, high fat foods, smoking and\nrefusing to wear motorcycle helmets? Are individuals entitled to\nunfettered enjoyment of drinking alcohol, using drugs recreatioally\nand a medication-free existence? The answer John Stuart Mill gave to\nsuch questions in his famous essay On Liberty (1869) was\n\u201cyes\u201d to the extent that these are self-regarding\nbehaviors that do not harm others. Mill defended liberal tolerance of\nintoxicants and narcotic drugs on the ground that liberty nets society\nbenefits that are lost when government tells us what to do. A\nlibertarian perspective condemns the \u201cnanny state\u201d that\nfails to treat citizens like conscientious adults (Harsanyi 2007:\n41).\n\nA robust regard for liberty prompts adopting an extreme libertarian\nperspective on the law. Yet \u201c[t]he notion of radical\nindividualism focuses on individual health behavior and ignores the\nsocial preconditions of that behavior \u201d(McGee 1999: 211). What,\non the surface, appear to be inviolate personal choices may be\nstraightforward products of social forces as diverse as \u201cmedia,\nadvertising, movies, literature and folklore\u201d (McGee 1999: 212).\nDebates over managed care have stressed that individuals\u2019\nunhealthy choices have externalities, including higher health care\ncosts for fellow citizens. Unhealthy lifestyles can impose substantial\ncosts on others. Smokers impose the costs of illnesses caused by\nexposure to second-hand smoke. Unhealthy diets and the lack of\nexercise can contribute to reduced worker productivity and increase\nhealth care spending. Obesity in pregnancy can adversely impact the\nhealth of developing fetuses and infants. Unhealthy lifestyles divert\nsocietal resources from other areas of public need, such as education\n(McGee 1999).\n5.6 The Patient\u2019s Right to Refuse Life Saving Care\n\nWhether persons with mental conditions are morally required to take\nmedications that make them better able to live normal lives could be\nstyled as a question of the limits of private choice. Some mental\nhealth patients are not competent to make their own treatment\ndecisions, but the vast majority are competent most of the time. Some\npatients are offered medications by their physicians to curb\ndistinctly anti-social impulses such as oppositionality, verbal\naggression and violence. It could be argued that these patients have\nan ethical obligation to medicate themselves, as advised. Competent\npatients with cognitive and emotional problems (such as moderate\ndepression or mild hallucinations) that affect mainly themselves may\nplausibly argue that the benefits of psychotropic medications are not\noutweighed by the risks of lethargy, sexual dysfunction, tremor,\nspeech problems and organ damage. Questions of political philosophy\nare implicated in debates over the extent to which authorities may\ncompel medication use by death row inmates, defendants awaiting trial,\nprisoners and in-patients in state hospitals.\n\nThe flowering of bioethics as an academic discipline and branch of\nphilosophy was fed by religious, moral and ethical concerns raised by\nhigh profile legal cases about the right to die (Beauchamp 2000).\nThese cases seemed to place the power to \u201cplay\nGod\u201d\u2014make life and death decisions\u2014in the hands of\npatients, families and physicians. The field was influenced, for\nexample, by the famous Karen Quinlan decision (In the Matter of\nQuinlan, 1976). This case transported the federal constitutional\nideal of the right to decisional privacy into state law, and\ncharacterized the right of a comatose woman\u2019s family to refuse\nlife-saving treatment on her behalf as a \u201cright to\nprivacy\u201d (Jonsen 1998). After the Quinlan decision, hospitals\nbegan setting up ethics committees to help doctors, patients and\nfamilies exercise decisional privacy rights in a lawful and\nresponsible manner. In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized in the\ncase of Nancy Cruzan a right of patients to refuse medical care such\nas artificial respiration and tube feeding, where the wishes of the\npatient to die could be established by clear and convincing\nevidence.\n\nMoral philosophers have sought a greater role for ethics in shaping\ninterpretations of constitutional law in life and death cases. On\nDecember 6, 1996, six prominent U.S. moral philosophers submitted an\nunprecedented brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in two cases,\nWashington v. Glucksberg (1997) and Vacco v. Quill\n(1997). The philosopher\u2019s were on the losing side. The U.S.\nSupreme Court refused to strike down laws banning assisted suicide,\ninstead upholding state laws in New York and Washington that\ncriminalized physician-assisted suicide. The Court argued that states\nhave an interest in protecting life, protecting the poor and the\ndisabled, and promoting physicians\u2019 ethical integrity.\nPatient\u2019s rights groups had argued that laws banning physician\nassisted suicide violated the privacy and equality rights of people\nwith terminal illnesses.\n\nAccording to what came to be known as \u201cThe Philosophers\u2019\nBrief\u201d, signed by Ronald Dworkin, Thomas Nagel, Robert Nozick,\nJohn Rawls, Thomas Scanlon, and Judith Jarvis Thomson in 1997 in\nconnection with the United States Supreme Court case, Washington v.\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997),\n\n\nA person\u2019s interest in following his own convictions at the end\nof life is so central a part of the more general right to make\n\u2018intimate and personal choices\u2019 for himself that a failure\nto protect that particular interest would undermine the general right\naltogether. Death is, for each of us, among the most significant\nevents of life. (Dworkin et al. 1997 [2007] pp.548\u2013561)\n\n\nThe Brief went on to argue that there is little moral difference\nbetween allowing an authorized physician to administer a life-ending\ninjection on behalf of a terminally ill patient and allowing an\nauthorized physician to turn off the respirator or remove the feeding\ntube of a person in a vegetative coma.\n\nThe 2007 Theresa Schiavo case raised the philosophically important\nquestion of when it is ethical to exercise privacy rights. A Florida\ncourt allowed spouse Michael Schiavo to terminate life support on wife\nTerri\u2019s behalf, after the court found that Terri\u2019s\nautonomous choice would have been to refuse life-sustaining care if\nshe were hopelessly comatose. Since the age of twenty-five, Terri had\nsubsisted in a \u201cpersistent vegetative coma\u201d. Autopsy\nestablished that Terri had massive and irreversible brain damage, as\nher husband believed. Terri\u2019s parents had doubted the diagnosis\nof hopeless coma and wanted their daughter alive. Assuming Michael\nSchiavo was justified in ignoring the pleas of strangers who wanted\nhim to keep his wife alive, it is less clear that he was justified in\nturning down the pleas of his wife\u2019s own parents, who urged\nSchiavo to waive his wife\u2019s \u201cprivacy\u201d and offered to\nassume complete responsibility for her care. What are the obligations\nof kin to honor the care and kinship wishes of fellow family members?\nWhat weight do privacy arguments on behalf of an incompetent spouse\nhave in the face of parental claims?\n6. Conclusion\n\nPhilosophers have identified and debated several meanings of\n\u201cprivacy\u201d deployed in medical contexts. Respect for\nrecognized forms of privacy \u2014informational\n (Section 1),\n physical\n (Section 2),\n associational\n (Section 3),\n proprietary\n (Section 4)\n and decisional\n (Section 5)\u2014is\n an ideal of biomedical ethics for the conduct of clinical research\nand administrative practices relating to physical and behavioral\nhealth. There is wide philosophical consensus about the importance of\nmedical confidentiality, modesty and bodily integrity in all health\nsettings; but substantial philosophical disagreement about the limits\nof personal autonomy or individual choice in fields relating to\ncontagious diseases, human reproduction and genetics. Recently,\nsharing medical information with family friends and the general public\nvoluntarily has supplanted norms of secrecy prompted by shame and\nstigma. Moreover, voluntarily sharing medical data is widely\nencouraged by researchers and officials to promote public health and\nprecision medicine. As digital medical data technologies, mobile\nhealth care apps, telemedicine, public health surveillance, and brain\nimaging technologies expand, the range and complexity of important\nprivacy questions in medicine will also expand.
