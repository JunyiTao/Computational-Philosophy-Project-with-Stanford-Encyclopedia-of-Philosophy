    "main_text": "Additional Features of Divine Knowledge\n2. Additional Features of Divine Knowledge\nOmniscience is supposed to be knowledge that is maximal or complete. Perhaps knowledge of all truths, as (D1) puts it, captures that idea. But there are other features that might be included in such maximal knowledge when it is had by a perfect being. For example, perhaps a perfect being does not merely believe all true propositions but, in addition, could not possibly be mistaken. Perhaps, in other words, such a being is infallible, that is, necessarily such that any proposition it believes is true. Van Inwagen (2006: 26) adds to his variant of (D1) that it is impossible that there is a proposition q such that S believes q and q is false, which is equivalent to requiring that necessarily if S believes p then p is true. (See also van Inwagen 2002: 221.) It is conceivable that a being might satisfy (D1) by knowing all truths without its being such that it could not possibly hold a false belief. In that case infallibility adds an additional component to the standard account given by (D1).\nA related idea emerges from the suggestion that not only does a perfect being exist necessarily, but it has its various great-making properties of necessity. The suggestion is that a being worthy of worship should not \u201cpossess its various excellences in some merely adventitious manner\u201d (Findlay 1948: 180). In that case, another feature of divine knowledge, if God exists necessarily, is being essentially omniscient, that is, being omniscient and not possibly lacking omniscience. Essential omniscience entails infallibility\u2014a being who could not possibly fail to be omniscient could not possibly be mistaken\u2014but the reverse does not hold, for a being who could not possibly believe a falsehood might nevertheless fail to believe all truths. So essential omniscience might be another additional component to the standard account. In an influential article Pike (1965) has argued for the incompatibility of essential omniscience and voluntary human action (see Section 3).\nAnother question that arises about God\u2019s knowledge is whether it is all occurrent knowledge or whether some of his knowledge is dispositional. Knowledge of a proposition is occurrent if the knower has that proposition in mind. And knowledge of a proposition is dispositional, roughly, if the person knows the proposition but is not currently thinking about it or entertaining it, that is, if the person has a dispositional belief (see Section 2.1 of the entry on belief) in that proposition. Philosophers have answered this question differently. Thomas Aquinas claimed that God\u2019s knowledge was not \u201cdiscursive\u201d (Summa Theologiae, I, 14, 7), by which he meant, in the first place, that God does not first think of one thing and then think of another, for \u201cGod sees all things together and not successively\u201d. On the other hand, Hunt (1995) has argued that taking God\u2019s knowledge of the future to be dispositional can provide a way of reconciling divine foreknowledge with human free action (see next section). It seems hard to understand, however, how someone with the vast ability to be omniscient could fail to be aware of any part of what they know.\nA second thing that Aquinas meant by claiming that God\u2019s knowledge is not discursive is that God does not derive his knowledge by deducing conclusions from other things that he knows. Of course the propositions God knows stand in logical relations with each other, and that includes standing in the relation of premisses to valid conclusion. Aquinas\u2019s claim, however, is that God does not arrive at a conclusion by deducing it from premisses. In contrast, however, Mavrodes (1988), recognizing the many logical relations in which propositions stand to one another, conjectures that all of God\u2019s knowledge is inferential.\nThe usual discussions of omniscience treat it as a special case of knowledge, although, perhaps, with such additional features as being arrived at infallibly or through essential omniscience. A standard account of knowledge holds that it is justified true belief, plus a \u201cfourth condition\u201d to avoid counterexamples (see, for example, Chisholm 1989: 90\u201391). Perhaps, instead, knowledge is warranted true belief, that is, a true belief produced by ones noetic faculties functioning properly in circumstances in which they were designed to function (see, for example, Plantinga 1993). Or, according to another recent proposal, the \u201cKnowledge First\u201d view, knowledge is a general state not to be analyzed by satisfying some other conditions (see Williamson 2000); but even on this suggestion, knowledge entails belief and justification. Thus, on all of these views, knowledge involves belief\u2014as did our discussion two paragraphs back of whether omniscience could include dispositional belief. For the most part, however, philosophers have not devoted much attention to the status of God\u2019s beliefs or the nature of his justification. One exception is the claim of Alston (1986) that God\u2019s knowledge is not divided into separate beliefs and that in fact God does not have beliefs. According to Alston, God has an intuitive, immediate awareness of all truth, which gives him knowledge without belief. For criticism of Alston\u2019s view, see (Hasker 1988) and (Dickinson 2019).\nWhether considerations of perfection require that God\u2019s knowledge includes any of these additional features, most discussions of omniscience do not focus on whether it includes infallibility, essential omniscience, being \u201cnon-discursive\u201d, or not involving belief. Instead, they primarily address the range of the knowledge that omniscient requires. Accordingly in what follows we will consider issues that arise when omniscience is understood along the lines of (D1).\n",
