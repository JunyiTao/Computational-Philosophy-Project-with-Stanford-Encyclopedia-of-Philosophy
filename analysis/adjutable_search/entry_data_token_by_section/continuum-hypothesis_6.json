    "main_text": "Regular Cardinals || The Case\n3.3 The Case\nNevertheless, if one supplements large cardinal axioms then\n\u03a9-complete theories are forthcoming. This is the centerpiece of\nthe case against CH. \n\nTheorem 3.12\n(Woodin). Assume that there is a proper class of\nWoodin cardinals and that the Strong\n\u03a9 Conjecture holds. \n\n There is an axiom A such\nthat  ZFC + A is\n\u03a9-satisfiable and \nZFC + A is\n\u03a9-complete for the structure\nH(\u03c92). \n\n\nAny such axiom A has the feature that\nZFC + A \u22a7\u03a9 \u2018H(\u03c92) \u22a7 \u00acCH\u2019.\n\n\n\n Let us rephrase this as follows: For each A satisfying (1),\nlet \nTA = {\u03c6 | ZFC +\nA \u22a7\u03a9 \u2018H(\u03c92) \u22a7 \u00ac\u03c6\u2019}.\n The theorem says that if there is a proper class of Woodin\ncardinals and the \u03a9 Conjecture holds, then there are\n(non-trivial) \u03a9-complete theories TA of\nH(\u03c92) and all such theories contain \u00acCH. \n It is natural to ask whether there is greater agreement among the\n\u03a9-complete theories TA. Ideally, there\nwould be just one. A recent result (building on Theorem 5.5) shows\nthat if there is one such theory then there are many such\ntheories. \n\nTheorem 3.13 (Koellner and\nWoodin 2009). Assume that there is a proper class of\nWoodin cardinals. Suppose that A is an axiom\nsuch that \n\n\n\u00a0i.\u00a0 ZFC + A is \u03a9-satisfiable and\n\nii.\u00a0 ZFC + A is\n\u03a9-complete for the structure\nH(\u03c92).\n\n\nThen there is an axiom B such that \n\n\n\u00a0i\u2032.\u00a0 ZFC + B is \u03a9-satisfiable and\n\nii\u2032.\u00a0 ZFC + B is \u03a9-complete for the structure\nH(\u03c92)\n\n\nand TA\u2260TB. \n\n How then shall one select from among these theories?\nWoodin's work in this area goes a good deal beyond Theorem\n5.1. In addition to isolating an axiom that satisfies (1) of Theorem\n5.1 (assuming \u03a9-satisfiability), he isolates a very special such\naxiom, namely, the axiom (\u2217) (\u201cstar\u201d) mentioned\nearlier. \n This axiom can be phrased in terms of (the provability notion of)\n\u03a9-logic: \n\nTheorem 3.14\n(Woodin). Assume ZFC and that there is\na proper class of Woodin cardinals. Then the following\nare equivalent: \n\n (\u2217). \nFor each\n\u03a02-sentence \u03c6 in the language for the\nstructure\n\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9\nif\nZFC + \u201c\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9 \u22a7 \u03c6\u201d\nis \u03a9-consistent, then\n\u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9 \u22a7 \u03c6.\n\n\n It follows that of the various\ntheories TA involved in Theorem 5.1, there is\none that stands out: The theory T(\u2217) given by\n(\u2217). This theory maximizes the \u03a02-theory of the\nstructure \u27e8H(\u03c92), \u2208, INS, A | A \u2208 \ud835\udcab\n(\u211d) \u2229 L(\u211d)\u27e9. \n The continuum hypothesis fails in this theory. Moreover, in the\nmaximal theory T(\u2217) given by (\u2217) the\nsize of the continuum is \u21352.[9]\n\n To summarize: Assuming the Strong \u03a9 Conjecture, there is a\n\u201cgood\u201d theory of H(\u03c92) and all such\ntheories imply that CH fails. Moreover, (again, assuming the Strong\n\u03a9 Conjecture) there is a maximal such theory and in that theory\n2\u21350 = \u21352. \nFurther Reading: For the mathematics concerning\n\u2119max see Woodin (1999). For an introduction to\n\u03a9-logic see Bagaria, Castells & Larson (2006). For\nmore on incompatible \u03a9-complete theories see Koellner & Woodin\n(2009). For more on the case against CH see Woodin (2001a,b, 2005a,b). \n4. The Multiverse\nThe above case for the failure of CH is the strongest known local\ncase for axioms that settle CH. In this section and the next we will\nswitch sides and consider the pluralist arguments to the effect that\nCH does not have an answer (in this section) and to the effect that\nthere is an equally good case for CH (in the next section). In the\nfinal two section we will investigate optimistic global scenarios that\nprovide hope of settling the issue. \n The pluralist maintains that the independence results effectively\nsettle the undecided questions by showing that they have no\nanswer. One way of providing a foundational framework for such a view\nis in terms of the multiverse. On this view there is not a\nsingle universe of set theory but rather\na multiverse of legitimate candidates, some of which may be\npreferable to others for certain purposes but none of which can be\nsaid to be the \u201ctrue\u201d universe. The multiverse\nconception of truth is the view that a statement of set theory\ncan only be said to be true simpliciter if it is true in all universes\nof the multiverse. For the purposes of this discussion we shall say\nthat a statement is indeterminate according to the multiverse\nconception if it is neither true nor false according to the\nmultiverse conception. How radical such a view is depends on the\nbreadth of the conception of the multiverse. \n",
