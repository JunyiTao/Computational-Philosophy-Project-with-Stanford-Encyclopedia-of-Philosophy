    "main_text": "\n\nRichard Rorty (1931\u20132007) developed a distinctive and\ncontroversial brand of pragmatism that expressed itself along two main\naxes. One is negative \u2013 a critical diagnosis of what Rorty takes\nto be defining projects of modern philosophy. The other is positive\n\u2013 an attempt to show what intellectual culture might look like,\nonce we free ourselves from the governing metaphors of mind and\nknowledge in which the traditional problems of epistemology and\nmetaphysics (and indeed, in Rorty\u2019s view, the self-conception of\nmodern philosophy) are rooted. The centerpiece of Rorty\u2019s\ncritique is the provocative account offered in Philosophy and the\nMirror of Nature (1979, hereafter PMN). In this book, and in the\nclosely related essays collected in Consequences of\nPragmatism (1982, hereafter CP), Rorty\u2019s principal target\nis the philosophical idea of knowledge as representation, as a mental\nmirroring of a mind-external world. Providing a contrasting image of\nphilosophy, Rorty has sought to integrate and apply the milestone\nachievements of Dewey, Hegel and Darwin in a pragmatist synthesis of\nhistoricism and naturalism. Characterizations and illustrations of a\npost-epistemological intellectual culture, present in both PMN (part\nIII) and CP (xxxvii\u2013xliv), are more richly developed in later\nworks, such as Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity (1989,\nhereafter CIS), in the popular essays and articles collected in\nPhilosophy and Social Hope (1999, hereafter PSH), and in the\nfour volumes of philosophical papers, Objectivity, Relativism, and\nTruth (1991, hereafter ORT); Essays on Heidegger and\nOthers (1991, hereafter EHO); Truth and Progress (1998,\nhereafter TP); and Philosophy as Cultural Politics (2007,\nhereafter PCP). In these writings, ranging over an unusually wide\nintellectual territory, Rorty offers a highly integrated, multifaceted\nview of thought, culture, and politics, a view that has made him one\nof the most widely discussed philosophers in our time.\n",
