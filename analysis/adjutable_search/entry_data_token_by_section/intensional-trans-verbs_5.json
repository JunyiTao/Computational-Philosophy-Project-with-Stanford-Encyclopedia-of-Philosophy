    "main_text": "Prior\u2019s Puzzle\n6. Prior\u2019s Puzzle\n\nIntensional transitive verbs are also involved in another puzzle of\nsubstitution-resistance besides the one already discussed. In the\nliterature on propositional attitude reports, it\u2019s the received view\nthat the complement clauses in such reports refer to propositions. So,\nfor example, in \u2018Holmes believes that Moriarty has\nreturned\u2019, the clause \u2018that Moriarty has returned\u2019\nis taken to stand for the proposition that Moriarty has returned. The\nwhole ascription is then understood to have the form Rab,\nwhich in terms of the example means that Holmes (a) stands in\nthe relation of belief (R) to the proposition that Moriarty\nhas returned (b). However, as well as being denoted by\nthat-clauses, it seems that propositions are also denoted by\nproposition descriptions, noun phrases that explicitly use \u2018the\nproposition\u2019, such as, in the previous sentence, \u2018the\nproposition that Moriarty has returned\u2019. So, if the clause and\nthe description co-denote, we have the following truth: \n\n(20)\n that Moriarty has returned is the proposition that Moriarty has\nreturned.\n\n\nBut then we should be able to substitute proposition-description for\nthat-clause, which, indeed, works well enough for\n\u2018believes\u2019: from \u2018Holmes believes that Moriarty has\nreturned\u2019 it does seem to follow that Holmes believes the\nproposition that Moriarty has returned, even though a side-effect of\nthe substitution is to change the clausal \u2018believes\u2019 into\nits transitive form. However, \u2018believes\u2019 is rather special\nin this respect. Despite (20), examples (21a) and (21b) below\nappear to have very different meanings:\n\n(21a)\n Holmes {fears/suspects} that Moriarty has returned.\n\n\n(21b)\n Holmes {fears/suspects} the proposition that Moriarty has\nreturned.\n\n\n(21a) may well be true, but it is unlikely that Holmes fears a\nproposition, or that some proposition is a thing of which he is\nsuspicious. (This phenomenon seems first to have been noted in print\nby A. N. Prior (1963).) \n\nThat the meaning of the minor premise does not survive substitution is\nthe rule rather than the exception: we get a similar outcome with\n\u2018announce\u2019, \u2018anticipate\u2019, \u2018ask\u2019,\n\u2018boast\u2019, \u2018calculate\u2019, \u2018caution\u2019,\n\u2018complain\u2019, \u2018conclude\u2019, \u2018crow\u2019,\n\u2018decide\u2019, \u2018detect\u2019, \u2018discover\u2019,\n\u2018dream\u2019, \u2018estimate\u2019, \u2018forget\u2019,\n\u2018guess\u2019, \u2018hope\u2019, \u2018insinuate\u2019,\n\u2018insist\u2019, \u2018interrogate\u2019 (literary theory),\n\u2018judge\u2019, \u2018know\u2019, \u2018love\u2019,\n\u2018mention\u2019, \u2018notice\u2019, \u2018observe\u2019,\n\u2018prefer\u2019, \u2018pretend\u2019,\n\u2018question\u2019,\u2018realize\u2019, \u2018rejoice\u2019,\n\u2018require\u2019, \u2018see\u2019, \u2018suggest\u2019,\n\u2018surmise\u2019, \u2018suspect\u2019, \u2018trust\u2019,\n\u2018understand\u2019, \u2018vote\u2019, \u2018wish\u2019, and\nvarious cognates of these. In some cases, substitution fails because\nit is meaning-altering, in others because it is meaning-dissolving (a\nselection constraint is violated, or the purported transitive verb\nsimply doesn\u2019t exist in the language). The verbs for which\nsubstitution is acceptable are thinner on the ground: inference verbs\nsuch as \u2018conclude\u2019, \u2018deduce\u2019,\n\u2018entail\u2019 and \u2018establish\u2019, along with a few\nothers like \u2018accept\u2019,\u2018believe\u2019,\n\u2018doubt\u2019, \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018verify\u2019 (but\nfor \u2018believe\u2019 see King 2002, 359\u201360; Forbes 2018,\n118; and Nebel 2019, 97\u20139). \n\nThe puzzle doesn\u2019t depend on the credentials of (20) as an identity\nsentence. Even if, for whatever reason, it isn\u2019t, it is still hard to\nsee how truth-value can change going from (21a) to (21b), granted\nthat the proposition that Moriarty has returned and that\nMoriarty has returned are co-denoting. There also doesn\u2019t seem to\nbe a useful application of a traditional account of referential\nopacity, such as Frege\u2019s (discussed in connection with (2c) above).\nSubstitution-failure is explained in Fregean terms by co-denoting\nexpressions having different senses, but it\u2019s unclear that adding or\ndeleting \u2018the proposition\u2019 is a significant enough\ndifference to change sense. We also expect that examples of\nsubstitution-failure become unrealistic if the subject is attributed\nexplicit belief in the identity premise. However, adding that Holmes\nis absolutely clear about the truth of (20) and has it at the\nforefront of his consciousness doesn\u2019t make it any more likely that\n(21b) is true, even though (21a) is. \n\nConsequently, there is some appeal to solutions of Prior\u2019s Puzzle that\ndiscern an equivocation in the inference, or propose that the crucial\nterms, the proposition that Moriarty has returned and\nthat Moriarty has returned, aren\u2019t really coreferential as\nthey occur in the inference. An approach of the first kind, in (King\n2002), argues that the transitive and clausal forms of the intensional\nverb are polysemous, that is, weakly ambiguous (the two\nsenses are related). This has been criticized on the basis of ellipsis\nexamples, such as \u2018Bob didn\u2019t even mention the proposition that\nfirst-order logic is undecidable, let alone that it is provable\u2019\n(Boer 2009, 552), and \u2018the Soviet authorities genuinely fear a\nreligious revival, and that the contagion of religion will\nspread\u2019 (after Nebel 2019, 77). Since these examples don\u2019t\nstrike one as amusingly incongruous, in the way that typical examples\nof zeugma do (\u2018All over Ireland the farmers grew potatoes,\nbarley, and bored\u2019), they are in tension with a postulation of\npolysemy. Consequently, Boer (2009) and Nebel (2019) propose that the\nproblem lies in an equivocation in the terms the proposition that\nMoriarty has returned and that Moriarty has returned. On\nboth their accounts, it is the propositional description \u2018the\nproposition that\u2026\u2019 which fails to denote what one might\nexpect. On the other hand, as evidence in favor of polysemy, there is\nthe fact that some cases of ellipsis seem in some way anomalous, such\nas \u2018John heard thunder and that a storm was rolling in\u2019.\nHere the anomaly can be explained in terms of how\ndifferent the two senses of \u2018heard\u2019 are.\n\nEvent semantics (see section 5 above) provides an alternative which\nmay avoid the need for any kind of equivocation. An initial proposal\nis made in (Pietroski 2000) for \u2018explain\u2019, which behaves\nlike \u2018fear\u2019 and \u2018suspect\u2019, as in\n\n(22a)\n Martin explained that the nothing itself nothings.\n\n\n(22b)\n Martin explained the proposition that the nothing itself\nnothings.\n\n\n(22a) may well be true but (22b) is unlikely. The idea is then that\nthe clausal and transitive forms of \u2018explain\u2019 take\ndifferent thematic complements, content versus theme: with the clausal\nverb of (22a), a \u2018that\u2019-clause provides a content, while\nwith the transitive verb of (22b), a proposition description provides\na theme, the thing that gets explained. Since, as already\nnoted, a side-effect of the substitution is to change the verb from\nits clausal to its transitive form, a consequent side-effect is to\nchange the role ascribed to the proposition from content to theme.\nThis account is developed in (Pietroski 2005) and also, as an\nextension of the event semantics of (Forbes 2006), in (Forbes\n2018).\n",
