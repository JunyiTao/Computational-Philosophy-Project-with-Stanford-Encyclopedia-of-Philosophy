    "main_text": "Inertial frames in the 20th century: special and general relativity || Simultaneity and reference-frames\n2.5 From special relativity and Lorentz invariance to general relativity and general covariance\n\nIt may seem surprising that, after this insightful analysis of the\nconcept of inertial frame and its role in electrodynamics, Einstein\nshould have turned almost immediately to call that concept into\nquestion. But he became convinced, largely by his reading of Mach,\nthat the central role of inertial frames was an \u201cepistemological\ndefect\u201d that special relativity shared with Newtonian mechanics.\nOnly relative motions are observable, yet both of these theories\npurport to identify a privileged state of motion and use it to explain\nobservable effects (such as centrifugal forces). Coordinate systems\nare not observable, yet both of these theories assign a fundamental\nphysical role to certain kinds of coordinate system, namely, the\ninertial systems. In either theory, inertial coordinates are\ndistinguished from all others, and the laws of physics are said to\nhold only relative to inertial coordinate systems. In an\nepistemologically sophisticated theory, both of these problems would\nbe solved at once: the new theory would only refer to what is\nobservable, which is relative motion; it would admit arbitrary\ncoordinate systems, instead of confining itself to a special class of\nsystem. Why, after all, should any genuine physical phenomenon depend\non the choice of coordinate system?\n\nAnother way of expressing Einstein\u2019s view is to say that, in\nNewtonian mechanics and special relativity, rotation is\n\u201cabsolute\u201d because the transformations between inertial\nframes (Galilean or Lorentzian) preserve rotational states. Thus the\n\u201cabsoluteness\u201d of rotation arises precisely from singling\nout one type of frame, by one type of transformation, instead of\nallowing arbitrary transformations and arbitrary frames. Einstein held\nthat this epistemological insight had a natural mathematical\nrepresentation in the principle of general covariance, or the\nprinciple that the laws of nature are to be invariant under\narbitrary coordinate transformations. More precisely, what\nthis means is that coordinate transformations are no longer required\n(as in the affine spaces of Newtonian mechanics and special\nrelativity) to take straight lines to straight lines, and to preserve\nfurther metrical structures appropriate to each theory, but only to\npreserve the smoothness of curves (i.e. their differentiability). The\ngeneral theory of relativity was intended to be a generally covariant\ntheory of space-time, and its general covariance was intended to\nexpress the general relativity of motion (Cf. Einstein 1916, section\n3). The extent to which the theory realized Einstein\u2019s original\naims remains a topic of philosophical debate. (Cf. Related Entries:\n \u201cspace and time: the hole argument,\u201d\n\u201cEinstein\u2019s philosophy of science\u201d.) \n\nThe central role of inertial frames in Newtonian and Minkowski\nspace-time theories, in sum, rested on their shared assumption of the\nuniformity of space-time. In Newtonian mechanics and special\nrelativity, the formal relations between inertial coordinate\nsystems\u2014the Galilean and Lorentz transformations,\nrespectively\u2014correspond to symmetry transformations of uniform\nspace-time, that is, a space-time with non-trivial global symmetries.\nIn Einstein\u2019s context, a coordinate transformation from the\ncoordinates of one \u201cstationary system\u201d to those of another\nwould generally not reflect a global symmetry of space-time, just to\nthe extent that the two were relatively accelerating. \n\nAt the same time, we can say that the concept of inertial frame\nretains at least one aspect of the relevance that it had for Newton.\nAs we saw, Newton was aware that he could not determine (to put it in\nour language) an actual inertial frame from his analysis of the solar\nsystem; Corollary VI implied that all local phenomena were compatible\nwith an acceleration of the entire system, by nearly equal and nearly\nparallel accelerative forces acting on the sun, the planets, and their\nsatellites. By the very same reasoning, however, he established that\nsuch a uniformly accelerating frame was sufficient for a successful\nanalysis of the relevant causes acting within the system\u2014those\ncauses that determine the system\u2019s configuration. From this\nanalysis he could determine the configuration of the system, that is,\ndetermine that our system is approximately Keplerian, with small\ndeviations from Keplerian motion accounted for by perturbative actions\nof the members of the system on each other. In other words, though a\ntrue inertial frame cannot be determined, a sufficient approximation\nto an inertial frame provides a sufficient basis for this causal\naccount. \n\nIn empirical testing and measurement in general relativity, the\ntreatment of individual gravitating systems follows an analogous\npattern. For the analysis of interactions within a local system, an\nasymptotically flat solution to Einstein\u2019s equation plays a role\nanalogous to the Newtonian system that approximates the conditions of\nCorollary VI. In general relativity, there can be non-negligible\npost-Newtonian effects, such as spatial curvature, and the non-linear\nsuperposition of gravitational fields. When they appear, empirical\nconsequences such as anomalous precessions and light-bending provide\ntests of general relativity and other relativistic gravitation\ntheories. (See Will 2018, ch. 4, especially 4.1\u20134.3).\nAbstractly, we might wish to treat such a system as isolated within a\nregion of space-time that \u201cflattens out\u201d at infinity.\nPractically, it suffices to consider a region in which, at a\nsufficient remove from a system of mutually gravitating masses,\ncurvature becomes negligible in comparison with the curvature induced\nby those masses locally. In other words, analogously to the Newtonian\ncase, it is not necessary that such a system be isolated from external\ninfluences. It suffices that external influences make a negligible\ndifference to the actions of the masses among themselves, and to the\nresulting configuration of the system. In short, instead of providing\nan exact account of the global symmetries of space-time, the idea of\nan inertial frame still provides a crucial practical tool for the\nempirical study of actual physical interactions.\n",
