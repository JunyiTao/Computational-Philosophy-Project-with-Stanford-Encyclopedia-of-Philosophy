    "main_text": "Physics and the Special Sciences || Could there be any Special-Science Laws?\n10.2 Could there be any Special-Science Laws?\n\nSupposing that physicists do try to discover exceptionless\nregularities, and even supposing that our physicists will sometimes be\nsuccessful, there is a further question of whether it is a goal of any\nscience other than fundamental physics \u2014 any so-called special\nscience \u2014 to discover exceptionless regularities and whether\nthese scientists have any hope of succeeding. Consider an economic law\nof supply and demand that says that, when demand increases and supply\nis held fixed, price increases. Notice that, in some places, the price\nof gasoline has sometimes remained the same despite an increase in\ndemand and a fixed supply, because the price of gasoline was\ngovernment regulated. It appears that the law has to be understood as\nhaving a ceteris-paribus clause in order for it to be true. This\nproblem is a very general one. As Jerry Fodor (1989, 78) has pointed\nout, in virtue of being stated in a vocabulary of a special science,\nit is very likely that there will be limiting conditions \u2014\nespecially underlying physical conditions \u2014 that will undermine\nany interesting strict generalization of the special sciences,\nconditions that themselves could not be described in the\nspecial-science vocabulary. Donald Davidson prompted much of the\nrecent interest in special-science laws with his \u201cMental\nEvents\u201d (1980 [f.p. 1970], 207\u2013225). He gave an argument\nspecifically directed against the possibility of strict\npsycho-physical laws. More importantly, he made the suggestion that\nthe absence of such laws may be relevant to whether mental events ever\ncause physical events. This prompted a slew of papers dealing with the\nproblem of reconciling the absence of strict special-science laws with\nthe reality of mental causation (e.g., Loewer and Lepore 1987 and\n1989, Fodor 1989, Schiffer 1991, Pietroski and Rey 1995).\n\nProgress on the problem of provisos depends on three basic issues\nbeing distinguished. First, there is the question of what it is to be\na law, which in essence is the search for a necessarily true\ncompletion of: \u201cP is a law if and only if\n\u2026\u201d. Obviously, to be a true completion, it must hold for\nall P, whether P is a strict generalization or a\nceteris-paribus one. Second, there is also a need to\ndetermine the truth conditions of the generalization sentences used by\nscientists. Third, there is the a posteriori and scientific\nquestion of which generalizations expressed by the sentences used by\nthe scientists are true. The second of these issues is the one where\nthe action needs to be.\n\nOn this score, it is striking how little attention is given to the\npossible effects of context. Mightn\u2019t it be that, when the\neconomist utters a certain strict generalization sentence in an\n\u201ceconomic setting\u201d (say, in an economics textbook or at an\neconomics conference), context-sensitive considerations affecting its\ntruth conditions will have it turn out that the utterance is true?\nThis might be the case despite the fact that the same sentence uttered\nin a different context (say, in a discussion among fundamental\nphysicists or better yet in a philosophical discussion of laws) would\nresult in a clearly false utterance. These changing truth conditions\nmight be the result of something as plain as a contextual shift in the\ndomain of quantification or perhaps something less obvious. Whatever\nit is, the important point is that this shift could be a function of\nnothing more than the linguistic meaning of the sentence and familiar\nrules of interpretation (e.g., the rule of accommodation).\n\nConsider a situation where an engineering professor utters,\n\u201cWhen a metal bar is heated, the change in its length is\nproportional to the change in its temperature\u201d and suppose a\nstudent offers, \u201cNot when someone is hammering on both ends of\nthe bar.\u201d Has the student shown that the teacher\u2019s\nutterance was false? Maybe not. Notice that the student comes off\nsounding a bit insolent. In all likelihood, such an unusual situation\nas someone hammering on both ends of a heated bar would not have been\nin play when the professor said what he did. In fact, the reason the\nstudent comes off sounding insolent is because it seems that he should\nhave known that his example was irrelevant. Notice that the\nprofessor\u2019s sentence needn\u2019t include some implicit\nceteris-paribus clause in order for his utterance to be true;\nas this example illustrates, in ordinary conversations, plain old\nstrict generalization sentences are not always used to cover the full\nrange of actual cases. Indeed, they are rarely used in this way. If\nspecial scientists do make true utterances of generalization sentences\n(sometimes ceteris-paribus generalization sentences,\nsometimes not), then apparently nothing stands in the way of them\nuttering true special-science lawhood sentences. The issue here has\nbeen the truth of special-science generalizations, not any other\nrequirements of lawhood.\n",
