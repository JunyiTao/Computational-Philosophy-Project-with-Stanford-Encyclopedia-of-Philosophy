Data on the variation for a trait in\na specific group or population could be analyzed so as to estimate the\nparameters in the model that would generate the observed changes in\nthe average value of the trait over time. Thinking about evolution in\nthe terms of quantitative genetics meant that it was no longer\nnecessary, contra Johannsen (1911: 138) (and others), to\ninsist that evolution proceeded through \u201cconsiderable,\ndiscontinuous saltations\u201d. Notice, again the separate\ntheoretical genotypes and their contributions, this time to selection\ncoefficients, remain unobserved; the focus of the data analysis could\nbe on differences in the trait, not the mechanisms of trait\ndevelopment. The complexity of developmental mechanisms, which involve\ninteractions with the environment, was collapsed in the models into\nthe selection coefficients modulated by parameters for dominance\nbetween alleles (i.e., variants of a gene) within, and epistasis\nbetween, theoretical genotypes.\n\nA parallel development, initiated again by Fisher and Wright, as well\nas by J.B.S. Haldane, involved mathematical models of theoretical\ngenotypes at one or a few loci each contributing to the parameters for\nsurviving and leaving offspring. In this field, which came to be known\nas Population Genetics, estimation of selection coefficients of\ngenotypes inferred from distinct phenotypes was possible, albeit more\nreadily when the populations were subject to artificial selection in\nthe laboratory than when frequencies or changes over time were\nobserved in the wild (which was studied in the new field of\necological genetics). Just as in quantitative genetics, the\nfocus in population genetics was on difference in traits;\ncomplexities of development in its ecological context were typically\ncollapsed into the parameters of the models.\n",
