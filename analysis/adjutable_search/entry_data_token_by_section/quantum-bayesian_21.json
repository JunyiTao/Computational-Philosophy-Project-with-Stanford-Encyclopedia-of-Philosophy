    "main_text": "Related Views || Brukner and Zeilinger\n5.2 Brukner and Zeilinger\n\nBrukner and Zeilinger (2003), Zeilinger (2005) follow Schr\u00f6dinger\n(1935) and many others in viewing a quantum state as a catalogue of\nour knowledge about a system. Their view is not \\(\\psi\\)-epistemic\nbecause it denies that the system has an ontic state about\nwhich we may learn by observing it. Instead, a system is characterized\nby its information content. An elementary system contains information\nsufficient to answer one question. For a spin \u00bd system, a\nquestion about spin component in any direction may be answered by a\nsuitable observation. But the answer cannot typically be understood as\nrevealing the pre-existing value of spin-component in that direction,\nand answering this question by observation randomizes the answer to\nany future question about spin-component in different directions. So\nthe catalog of knowledge takes the form of a probability distribution\nover possible answers to all meaningful question about a quantum\nsystem that contains only one entry with probability 1 that might be\nconsidered a property that would be revealed if observed.\n\nBrukner (2018) has recently used an extension of Wigner\u2019s friend\nparadox (Wigner 1962) to argue that even the answers to such questions\ngiven by observation cannot be regarded as reflecting objective\nproperties of the devices supposedly recording them. If sound, such an\nargument provides a reason to modify this view of quantum states to\nmake it closer to that of QBists.\n",
