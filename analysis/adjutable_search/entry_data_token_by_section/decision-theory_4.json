    "main_text": "Utility measures of preference || The von Neumann and Morgenstern (vNM) representation theorem\n2.3 The von Neumann and Morgenstern (vNM) representation theorem\n\nThe last section provided an interval-valued utility representation of\na person\u2019s preferences over lotteries, on the assumption that\nlotteries are evaluated in terms of expected utility. Some might find\nthis a bit quick. Why should we assume that people evaluate lotteries\nin terms of their expected utilities? The vNM theorem effectively\nshores up the gaps in reasoning by shifting attention back to the\npreference relation. In addition to Transitivity and Completeness, vNM\nintroduce further principles governing rational preferences over\nlotteries, and show that an agent\u2019s preferences can be\nrepresented as maximising expected utility whenever her preferences\nsatisfy these principles.\n\nLet us first define, in formal terms, the expected utility of a\nlottery: Let \\(L_i\\) be a lottery from the set \\(\\bL\\) of lotteries,\nand \\(O_{ik}\\) the outcome, or prize, of lottery \\(L_i\\) that arises\nwith probability \\(p_{ik}\\). The expected utility of \\(L_i\\) is then\ndefined as:\n\n\nThe vNM equation. \n\n\\[EU(L_i) \\mathbin{\\dot{=}} \\sum_k u(O_{ik}) \\cdot p_{ik}\\]\n\n\n\nThe assumption made earlier can now be formally stated:\n\\begin{equation}\\tag{2} \\text{For any}\\ L_i, L_j\\in \\bL: L_i\\preceq\nL_j\\Leftrightarrow EU(L_i)\\leq EU(L_j) \\end{equation}\n\n\nWhen the above holds, we say that there is an expected utility\nfunction that represents the agent\u2019s preferences; in other\nwords, the agent can be represented as maximising expected\nutility.\n\nThe question that vNM address is: What sort of preferences can be thus\nrepresented? To answer this question, we must return to the underlying\npreference relation \\(\\preceq\\) over the set of options, in this case\ninvolving lotteries. The vNM theorem requires the set \\(\\bL\\) of\nlotteries to be rather extensive: it is closed under\n\u201cprobability mixture\u201d, that is, if \\(L_i, L_j\\in \\bL\\),\nthen compound lotteries that have \\(L_i\\) and \\(L_j\\) as possible\nprizes are also in \\(\\bL\\). (Another technical assumption, that will\nnot be discussed in detail, is that compound lotteries can always be\nreduced, in accordance with the laws of probability, to simple\nlotteries that only involve basic prizes.)\n\nA basic rationality constraint on the preference relation has already\nbeen discussed\u2014that it weakly orders the options (i.e.,\nsatisfies Transitivity and Completeness). The following notation will\nbe used to introduce the two additional vNM axioms of preference:\n\\(\\{pA, (1-p)B\\}\\) denotes a lottery that results either in \\(A\\),\nwith probability \\(p\\), or \\(B\\), with probability \\(1-p\\), where\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be final outcomes but can also be lotteries.\n\n\nAxiom 3 (Continuity)\n\nSuppose \\(A\\preceq B\\preceq C\\). Then there is a \\(p\\in [0,1]\\) such\nthat: \n\n  \\[\\{pA, (1-p)C\\}\\sim B\\]\n\n\nAxiom 4 (Independence)\n\nSuppose \\(A\\preceq B\\). Then for any \\(C\\), and any \\(p\\in\n[0,1]\\): \n\n\\[\\{pA, (1-p)C\\}\\preceq \\{pB, (1-p)C\\}\\]\n\n\n\nContinuity implies that no outcome \\(A\\) is so bad that you would not\nbe willing to take some gamble that might result in you ending up with\nthat outcome, but might otherwise result in you ending up with an\noutcome (\\(C\\)) that you find to be a marginal improvement on your\nstatus quo (\\(B\\)), provided that the chance of \\(A\\) is small enough.\nIntuitively, Continuity guarantees that an agent\u2019s evaluations\nof lotteries are appropriately sensitive to the probabilities of the\nlotteries\u2019 prizes.\n\nIndependence implies that when two alternatives have the same\nprobability for some particular outcome, our evaluation of the two\nalternatives should be independent of our opinion of that outcome.\nIntuitively, this means that preferences between lotteries should be\ngoverned only by the features of the lotteries that differ; the\ncommonalities between the lotteries should be effectively ignored.\n\n\nSome people find the\n Continuity axiom\n an unreasonable constraint on rational preference. Is there any\nprobability \\(p\\) such that you would be willing to accept a gamble\nthat has that probability of you losing your life and probability\n\\((1-p)\\) of you gaining $10? Many people think there is not. However,\nthe very same people would presumably cross the street to pick up a\n$10 bill they had dropped. But that is just taking a gamble that has a\nvery small probability of being killed by a car but a much higher\nprobability of gaining $10! More generally, although people rarely\nthink of it this way, they constantly take gambles that have minuscule\nchances of leading to imminent death, and correspondingly very high\nchances of some modest reward.\n\nIndependence seems a compelling requirement of rationality, when\nconsidered in the abstract. Nevertheless, there are famous examples\nwhere people often violate Independence without seeming irrational.\nThese examples involve complementarities between the possible\nlottery outcomes. A particularly well-known such example is the\nso-called Allais Paradox, which the French economist Maurice\nAllais (1953) first introduced in the early 1950s. The paradox turns\non comparing people\u2019s preferences over two pairs of lotteries\nsimilar to those given in Table 1. The lotteries are described in\nterms of the prizes that are associated with particular numbered\ntickets, where one ticket will be drawn randomly (for instance,\n\\(L_1\\) results in a prize of $2500 if one of the tickets numbered\n2\u201334 is drawn).\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_1\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$2400 \n\n\\(L_2\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$2400 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n1\n2\u201334\n35\u2013100 \n\n\\(L_3\\)\n$0\n$2500\n$0 \n\n\\(L_4\\)\n$2400\n$2400\n$0 \n\n\nTable 1. Allais\u2019 paradox\n\n\nIn this situation, many people strictly prefer \\(L_2\\) over \\(L_1\\)\nbut also \\(L_3\\) over \\(L_4\\) (as evidenced by their choice behaviour,\nas well as their testimony), a pair of preferences which will be\nreferred to as Allais\u2019\n preferences.[3]\n A common way to rationalise Allais\u2019 preferences, is that in the\nfirst choice situation, the risk of ending up with nothing when one\ncould have had $2400 for sure does not justify the increased chance of\na higher prize. In the second choice situation, however, the minimum\none stands to gain is $0 no matter which choice one makes. Therefore,\nin that case many people do think that the slight extra risk of $0 is\nworth the chance of a better prize.\n\nWhile the above reasoning may seem compelling, Allais\u2019\npreferences conflict with the\n Independence axiom.\n The following is true of both choice situations: whatever choice you\nmake, you will get the same prize if one of the tickets in the last\ncolumn is drawn. Therefore, Independence implies that both your\npreference between \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) and your preference between\n\\(L_3\\) and \\(L_4\\) should be independent of the prizes in that\ncolumn. But when you ignore the last column, \\(L_1\\) becomes identical\nto \\(L_3\\) and \\(L_2\\) to \\(L_4\\). Hence, if you prefer \\(L_2\\) over\n\\(L_1\\) but \\(L_3\\) over \\(L_4\\), there seems to be an inconsistency\nin your preference ordering. And there is definitely a violation of\nIndependence (given how the options have been described; an issue to\nwhich we return in\n Section 5.1).\n As a result, the pair of preferences under discussion cannot be\nrepresented as maximising expected utility. (Thus the\n\u201cparadox\u201d: many people think that Independence is a\nrequirement of rationality, but nevertheless also want to claim that\nthere is nothing irrational about Allais\u2019 preferences.)\n\nDecision theorists have reacted in different ways to Allais\u2019\nParadox. This issue will be revisited in\n Section 5.1,\n when challenges to EU theory will be discussed. The present goal is\nsimply to show that Continuity and Independence are compelling\nconstraints on rational preference, although not without their\ndetractors. The result vNM proved can be summarised thus:\n\nTheorem 2 (von Neumann-Morgenstern)\n\nLet \\(\\bO\\) be a finite set of outcomes, \\(\\bL\\) a set of\ncorresponding lotteries that is closed under probability mixture and\n\\(\\preceq\\) a weak preference relation on \\(\\bL\\). Then \\(\\preceq\\)\nsatisfies axioms 1\u20134 if and only if there exists a function\n\\(u\\), from \\(\\bO\\) into the set of real numbers, that is unique up to\npositive linear transformation, and relative to which \\(\\preceq\\) can\nbe represented as maximising expected utility.\n\nDavid Kreps (1988) gives an accessible illustration of the proof of\nthis theorem.\n",
