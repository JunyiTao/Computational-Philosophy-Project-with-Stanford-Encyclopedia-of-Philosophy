    "main_text": "Realism and anti-realism\n4. Realism and anti-realism\n\nThe neo-classical theories we surveyed in section 1 made the theory of\ntruth an application of their background metaphysics (and in some\ncases epistemology). In section 2 and especially in section 3, we\nreturned to the issue of what sorts of ontological commitments might\ngo with the theory of truth. There we saw a range of options, from\nrelatively ontologically non-committal theories, to theories requiring\nhighly specific ontologies.\n\nThere is another way in which truth relates to metaphysics. Many ideas\nabout realism and anti-realism are closely related to ideas about\ntruth. Indeed, many approaches to questions about realism and\nanti-realism simply make them questions about truth.\n",
