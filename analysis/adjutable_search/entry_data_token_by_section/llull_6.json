Taking advantage of this treaty, he undertook a project to\npromote catechesis, naturally joined by Ramon Llull. He traveled to\nSicily during the summer of 1313. Shortly afterwards, he traveled to\nTunisia, with the approval of Frederick III and the support of James\nII of Aragon, who translated some of Llull\u2019s work from Catalan\nto Latin. After this last trip to African lands, Llull went back to\nMajorca. He passed away in this island, at the age of 84, after March\n1316.\n",
