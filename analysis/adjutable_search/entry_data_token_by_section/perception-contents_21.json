    "main_text": "Theories of Intentionality in Experience || Functionalist Informational Theories of Experience\n8.2 Functionalist Informational Theories of Experience\n\nDretske and Tye have each proposed that an experience has the contents\nit does in virtue of having certain functional properties.\n\nAccording to Dretske, an experience has its content fixed by the\nbiological, phylogenetically determined function of the system (or\ncombination of systems: (1995), 22) of which it is a state. The\nfunction of the system is to provide information: for instance, the\nfunction of the auditory system is to provide information about pitch,\nintensity, timbre, and direction of sound, and it does this by\noccupying different states corresponding to different values for each\nof these properties. The different states are all the different\nauditory experiences that a given system is capable of being in. The\nsame main idea is developed by Ruth Millikan, who focuses on mental\ncontent generally rather than on experience content per\nse.\n\nTye\u2019s account of experience content derives from the theories of\nintentionality for belief developed by Stampe (1977) and Stalnaker\n(1984). According to Tye, an experience S of creature\nc has the content that p just in case: \u201cIf\noptimal conditions were to obtain, S would be tokened in\ncreature c if and only if P were the case; moreover,\nin these circumstances, S would be tokened in c\nbecause P is the case\u201d (2000, 136, note omitted; cf.\n1995, 101). For the case of visual experiences, Tye, like Dretske,\nappeals to the design of the visual system to explain what\n\u201coptimal conditions\u201d are: \u201cIn the case of evolved\ncreatures, it is natural to hold that such conditions for vision\ninvolve the various components of the visual system operating as they\nwere designed to do in the sort of external environment in which they\nwere designed to operate\u201d (Tye 2000, 138).\n\nBoth kinds of theories are externalist: according to them,\nwhat makes it the case that a subject\u2019s mental state has the\ncontent it does is in part facts about the subject\u2019s\nenvironment. Any objections to externalism about mental content are\nthus also objections to these theories of intentionality. For\ninstance, suppose there was a creature, Swampman, who suddenly popped\ninto existence due to random conglomeration of particles, and happened\nto be an intrinsic molecular duplicate of, say, Jerry Fodor. Pure\nexternalist theories (that is, theories that hold that the only way\nmental states can have content is by standing in the right external\nrelations to the subject\u2019s environment) are committed to denying\nthat Swampman would have any contentful mental states. Some\nphilosophers have found this commitment counterintuitive. For further\ndiscussion of this objection and others, see the entry on\n external theories of mental content.\n\nA central challenge facing Dretske\u2019s and Millikan\u2019s theory\nis to specify the relevant notions of informational system\nand function in an informational system. One question in the\narea is whether informational systems and functions within them are\ncontained within an organism, or whether they rather encompass\nmultiple organisms in a community. Much work by Millikan has been\ndevoted to this topic. According to her, an informational system\nencompasses both creatures who produce representations, and creatures\nwho use or receive them; and the relevant notion of function is\nsupposed to be defined in terms of both parts of such a system. For\ninstance, in a bee dance, what makes it the case that the bee dance\nrepresents the location of nectar is in part that other bees respond\nto it by flying to the nectar. A analogous challenge for co-variation\ntheories inspired by Stampe and Stalnaker is to specify what the\nrelevant \u2018becausal\u2019 relations are. Until these central\nnotions are pinned down, the theories remain programmatic.\n\nOne objection that has been raised against both kinds of informational\ntheories of experience (those that invoke biological functions, and\nthose that invoke co-variation) is that these theories are\ninsufficiently general. According to the objection, there can be\nproperties represented in a subject\u2019s experience even if she has\nnot been in causal contact with instances of those properties before,\nand which it is no part of the biological function of the visual\nsystem to represent. For example, consider impossible scenes depicted\nin Escher drawings, or a hallucination of a color that one has never\nseen before (such as Hume\u2019s missing shade of blue). Suppose\nexperiences can represent that one is standing before an Escher\nstaircase, or that something is the missing shade of blue. According\nto Tye\u2019s theory, this can happen only if in optimal conditions\nthat type of experience is tokened because these things are the case.\nBut since it is logically impossible to be standing before an Escher\nstaircase, this condition can never be met. And if it is nomologically\nimpossible to be seeing anything that is the missing shade of blue,\nthen even if the proposed necessary condition in principle can be met,\nthe worlds in which it is met would seem to be irrelevant ones for the\npurpose of the theory. So, the objection concludes, Tye\u2019s theory\nmust predict that Escher staircases and missing shades of color cannot\nbe represented in experience.
