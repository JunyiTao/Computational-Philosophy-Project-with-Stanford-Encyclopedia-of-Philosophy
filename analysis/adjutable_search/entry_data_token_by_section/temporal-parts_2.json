    "main_text": "Change and Temporal Parts\n3. Change and Temporal Parts\n\nEnough about what temporal parts are supposed to be. Why believe in\nthem at all? It\u2019s not clear whether ordinary thinking involves\nany commitment for or against temporal parts: some believe that it is\nneutral, while others believe that the default assumption is that\nthings don\u2019t have temporal parts. Regardless of what ordinary\nthinking tells us, advocates of temporal parts argue that their view\noffers the best solutions to a number of metaphysical problems.\nEndurance theorists respond by offering solutions of their own,\ncriticising the temporal-parts solutions, or both.\n\nOne metaphysical problem concerns how change is possible (this has\nbecome known as the \u2018problem of temporary intrinsics\u2019 or\nsometimes the \u2018problem of change\u2019). The banana in the\nfruitbowl was unripe a few days ago, and today it is overripe. Surely\nnothing can be both unripe and overripe?\u00a0 Of course, it\u2019s\nthe fact that the banana is unripe and overripe at different times\nwhich saves it from metaphysical peril: we all know that. But it would\nbe nice to understand why this fact is crucial: what is it about the\npassage of time which makes it possible for one and the same object to\nhave apparently incompatible properties?\n\nIf the banana has temporal parts, this explains how it can change: an\nearlier temporal part of the banana is unripe, while a later temporal\npart of the banana is overripe. More grandly: an earlier temporal part\nhas the property being-unripe, while a later temporal part\nhas the property being-ripe. There\u2019s no mystery here,\nany more than there is mystery in your being both hot and cold by\nhaving a hot head and cold feet: we\u2019re all familiar with the\nfact that different parts of the same object can have different\nproperties.\n\nIs this a good explanation of change? One objection is that\nperdurance-style temporal variation is not really change at all:\u00a0\nthe whole four-dimensional banana is neither unripe nor overripe, so\ncan\u2019t change between these states, and the temporal parts are\neither permanently unripe or permanently overripe, so they don\u2019t\nchange either. In response, perdurantists distinguish two ways of\ntalking about persisting things \u2013 an atemporal way, which takes\nin all times at once, and a temporal way of talking, relative to\nvarious times. On the atemporal way of talking, the whole\nfour-dimensional banana is neither unripe nor overripe; nevertheless,\nit\u2019s true to say in temporal terms that the whole banana is\nunripe on Monday, and the whole banana is overripe on Friday, because\nof the properties of the relevant temporal parts. Endurantists who\nclaim that temporal variation is not genuine change must challenge\nthis combination of temporal and atemporal talk.\n\nStage theorists give the same basic account of change as perdurantists\ndo, but they have a slightly different response to the no-change\nobjection. According to perdurantists, talk about the same banana at\ndifferent times is straightforwardly made true by one and the same\nfour-dimensional object existing at different times. But some fancy\nfootwork is needed to explain what it is for that object to be\noverripe right now: it\u2019s for it to have an overripe temporal\npart right now. In contrast, according to stage theorists, talk about\nthe banana being overripe right now is straightforwardly made true by\nthe banana being overripe, since the banana just is a momentary stage\nwhich exists right now. But some fancy footwork is needed to explain\nwhat it is for the same banana to exist at different times: it is for\nthe current momentary banana to stand in certain intimate causal\nrelations to momentary bananas in the past and the future.\n\nTemporal-parts accounts of change seem OK, but can endurantists come\nup with anything equally good or better? How can one and the same\nthing have different properties at different times? One radical answer\nis presentism, the view that only present objects, events and states\nexist: past and future do not exist. Presentism seems to dissolve the\nproblem of change: since only the overripe banana is present, its\nunripe state does not exist, so there\u2019s nothing to worry about.\n(For further discussion of presentism, see\n section 6.)\u00a0\n But unless there are independent reasons for accepting presentism\n(see the separate entry on\n time),\n it seems like a drastic response to the problem of change.\n\nLess radically, endurantists may claim that objects change by standing\nin different relations to different times. There is no absolute fact\nof the matter regarding the ripeness of the banana: instead, the\nbanana bears the being-unripe-on relation to Monday, and the\nbeing-overripe-on relation to Friday.\u00a0 (Alternatively,\nperhaps the banana possesses two compatible properties,\nbeing-unripe-on-Monday, and\nbeing-overripe-on-Friday.) There\u2019s no mystery in an\nobject which bears apparently incompatible relations to different\nthings: you are bigger than the Mona Lisa, and smaller than the\nLouvre, but metaphysicians don\u2019t puzzle over how you can be both\nbigger-than and smaller-than. Those who oppose this relational view of\nchangeable properties claim that it\u2019s just too relational: the\nbanana seems to lose all its intrinsic nature. We may also worry that,\nas with the temporal parts account, it\u2019s not clear whether\nanything really changes on this picture: the banana always stands in\nthe same relations to the various times.\n\n(For further discussion see the separate entry on\n intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties,\n especially section 1.1.)\n\nA third endurantist account of change is adverbialism. Change is\npuzzling because it seems that a single object (like the banana) both\nhas and doesn\u2019t have a single property (like\nbeing-unripe). The adverbialist idea is that, instead of\nsubdividing the object into temporal parts (the banana-on-Monday and\nthe banana-on-Friday), or subdividing the property (into\nbeing-unripe-on-Monday and being-overripe-on-Friday),\nwe should subdivide the way in which the object has the property. The\nbanana has the property being-unripe in a Monday way, and it\nfails to have that same property in a Friday way. (Adverbialism is\nso-called because it focuses on ways of having properties: an adverb\ntells you about the way something is done.) Objections to adverbialism\nfocus on whether this relativisation of ways things have (or\n\u2018instantiate\u2019) properties can explain change without\nsimply raising further problems about the nature of instantiation.\n\nIn summary, then, those who believe in temporal parts seem to have a\nnice explanation of change to hand. But those who reject temporal\nparts also have a range of options, none of which seems decisively to\nhave been ruled out. (For further discussion, see the separate entries\non\n change\n and on\n singular propositions\n .)\n\nThere have been a number of challenges to the idea there is any\ngenuinely metaphysical \u2018problem of change\u2019; this is\nsometimes diagnosed as a problem arising from confusions about tensed\nlanguage. However, there is no consensus about what the consequence\nwould be if there were no metaphysical problem of change: should we\ndefault to endurance, or to perdurance, or should we conclude that the\ncontrast between these two positions is also somehow illusory? \n\nSuggested Reading: It\u2019s a good idea to start\nwith Lewis (1986a, pp. 203\u20134), who coins the phrase\n\u2018problem of temporary intrinsics\u2019, argues that none of the\nendurance theories of change are satisfactory, and sets out the\nperdurance account of change. Wasserman (2006) surveys the debate; see\nalso Wasserman (2010). McTaggart (1927, sections 315\u20136), Simons\n(1987), Mellor (1998, section 8.4), McCall and Lowe (2009), and\nOderberg (2004) argue that variation between temporal parts is not\ngenuine change (Oderberg 2004 is also sceptical as to whether there is\nany genuine puzzle here). For a response see Heller (1992), then\nLombard (1994) in return. Botterell (2004) also criticises the\ntemporal parts account of change; Sattig (2002, 2003) objects to the\nperdurantist and stage accounts of predication; see also Hansson\nWahlberg (2009, 2010), Lombard (2006) and Perovic (2019); Giberman\n(2017) argues against endurantist accounts of change. For the\npresentist account of change, see Merricks (1994), Hinchliff (1996),\nZimmerman (1998a), and Fiocco (2010); Rettler (2012) makes other\nconnections between the metaphysics of persistence and of time. van\nInwagen (1990a) advocates a relations-to-times view of temporary\nproperties, as do Wasserman (2003) and Mellor (1981), although Mellor\n(1998) has a different account, in terms of fact-constituents;\nEffingham and Melia (2007) defend the view against objections from\nSider (2001). For discussion of Lewis\u2019s objection to the\nrelations-to-times view, see MacBride (2001) and Rodriguez-Pereyra\n(2003); for a related objection see Browning (1988). Rychter (2008)\ndiscusses what it is to have a property atemporally. Lowe (1987),\nJohnston (1987) and Haslanger (1989b) all propose versions of\nadverbialism. For discussion of these, see Lewis (1988; 2002), Lowe\n(1988b) and Lombard (2003). Miller and Braddon-Mitchell (2007) defend\nboth adverbialism and relations-to-times against objections; see also\nBottani (2016). Rea (1998b) argues that consideration of change does\nnot favour perdurantism. For stage theory see Sider (2000; 2001,\nsection 4.6). Hawley (2001, chapter 1) also advocates stage theory,\nand discusses most of the issues covered in this section. Alternative\naccounts of change are mooted by Ehring (1997; 2001), Simons (2000a),\nMacBride (2001), Parsons (2001), and Brower (2010). Klein (1999)\nargues that neither endurance nor perdurance theories permit genuine\nchange; see also Meincke (2019). In various ways, Rychter (2009),\nHansson (2007), and Hofweber (2009) argue that there is no genuine\nproblem of change; Raven (2011) argues that there is, whilst Einheuser\n(2012) gives a nuanced assessment. Eddon (2010a) argues that the\nproblem cannot give us purchase on which theory of persistence to\nadopt.\n",
