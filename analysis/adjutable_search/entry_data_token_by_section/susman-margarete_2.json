    "main_text": "The Lyrical I\n3. The Lyrical I\n\nSusman\u2019s first monograph, Das Wesen der modernen deutschen\nLyrik (The Character of Modern German Poetry, 1910)\nexamines the philosophical significance of modern poetry from Goethe\nto George and Rilke. Tracking the trajectory of the emergence of\nmodern poetry as a distinct art form with its own artistic logics,\nSusman\u2019s treatise presents a critical intervention against\nWilhelm Dilthey\u2019s conception of poetry as a reflection of the\npoet\u2019s authentic experience, i.e., Erlebnis as\ndistinguished from Erfahrung, which is a product of\ndiscursive reasoning. Taking her cue from Simmel\u2019s approach to\nart, Susman attends to poetry\u2019s generative power. Poetry\ngenerates its own forms artistically rather than deriving them from a\npre-existent order of life.\n\nRather than expressing authentic experience, poetry creates with its\ndistinct forms the conditions to create life forms through which\nexperience becomes possible in the first place. The \u201clyrical\nI\u201d, which Susman introduces here, is thus not just a term of\nliterary theory but also has wider philosophical implications.\n\nFor Susman, the \u201clyrical I\u201d is the particular form the\npoet creates with poetry: \u201cthe \u2018lyrical I\u2019 [is] a\nform [\u2026] the poet creates from the given I\u201d (1910: 16).\nIt is different from the poet\u2019s empirical I and not to be\nconfused with subjectivity. Distancing herself from the idea that\npoets express their innermost, authentic selves, Susman highlights the\n\u201cpurely formal character\u201d of the lyrical I that is given\nits symbolic articulation \u201ccompletely independently of its\nindividual and general aspects\u201d (1910: 18). According to Susman\nthe lyrical I is the \u201cexpression\u201d or \u201cform of an\nI\u201d. Like the artwork it retains its formal character completely\nindependent from its individual or general content because it is\ncreated rather than given. In other words, the poet does not find the\nlyrical I in her- or himself but, like \u201cthe speaking and acting\nfigures of a drama, [the poet] first must create the lyrical I out of\nwhat he finds in his given I\u201d (1910: 18).\n\nThe lyrical I is the formative principle of poesis. Its constructive\nrather than mimetic or merely reflective aspect suggests it has\nepistemological consequences for how we conceive ourselves beyond\naesthetics:\n\n\nAmong the forms art produces, the lyrical I is distinguished by being\nthe only form (Gestalt) in an artwork whose contents project\nthe whole scope and extent of the artwork and which alone defines its\nthrust, its world. (1910: 19)\n\n\nThe lyrical I, in other words projects a world view or particular way\nto see and experience the world as a whole. It is however not the\nsubjective representation of an \u201cempirical I\u201d but the\n\u201cobjective form of the I\u201d that the poem contrives (1910:\n19). The lyrical I is, as it were, the esthetic expression of the\nindividual\u2019s unique and irreducible incommensurability in the\nact of symbolic representation: \u201cFor every individual is\nincommensurable in relation to every other\u201d (1910: 21). The\nproject of expressing the singularity of the individual, Susman notes,\nis delivered from the individual\u2019s incommensurability by way of\nsymbolic representation:\n\n\nFor precisely the incommensurable of the individual [des\nIndividuellen], which is the world\u2019s true infinity, is the\ncontent of the symbol. (1910: 21f.)\n\n\nSusman understands the symbol thus as a poetic means of expressing\ndiversity rather than uniform unity. The symbol allows for the\nexpression of the individual\u2019s incommensurability in a language\nin which the word\u2019s fecundity produces the poetic experience.\nPoetry is transformative because it uses language abstractly as well\nas in a concrete manner. This unique combination is for Susman what\ndefines its symbolic use (1910: 23f.). The development of modern\npoetry consists in this process of symbolizing the modern experience,\na process iterated in the articulations of the diversity of lyrical\nI\u2019s it brings forth. As a result, poetry must be understood as\nperforming a philosophically critical task, a task that Susman\ndescribes in terms that can be read as summarizing Simmel\u2019s\nthought succinctly: \u201cForm presents existence for us. To form\nmeans to give the things their existence for us\u201d (1910: 91).\n",
