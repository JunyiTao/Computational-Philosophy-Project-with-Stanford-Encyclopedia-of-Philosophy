    "main_text": "Philosophical Themes in the Law of Contracts || Intentionality\n2.3 Intentionality\n\nOn the standard picture, contractual obligations are grounded in the\nparties\u2019 promissory intentions, or in such intentions as might\nreasonably be inferred from the parties\u2019 speech acts. The\nstandard picture needs a philosophy of action if modern doctrine is to\nbe convincingly justified. The demands of mass contracting mean that\ncontracts are often entered into without bespoke drafting or indeed\nany dickering at all. The law finds contractual obligations in such\nthoughtless acts as selecting \u201cI agree\u201d on a software\nlicense form without reading its terms (Rakoff 1983; Barnett 2002;\nRadin 2014). Form-drafters usually have reason to know that such\nactions are thoughtless and, also, that the average consumer is\ngenerally not in the position of being able to bargain for better\nterms. Indeed, form-drafters often arrange their contractual practices\nto make bespoke bargaining impossible, for example by having their\nforms presented electronically or by employees who are not empowered\nto modify terms. The reasonableness of imputing promissory intent in\nsuch circumstances seems questionable (Radin 2007; 2014).\n\nThe puzzle is magnified by the pervasiveness of form contracting in\nmodern markets and by the details of contract law doctrine. For\nexample, the law\u2019s treatment of standard forms as agreements is\nnot so easily dismissed as a \u201cconvenient fiction\u201d\njustified by the general need to enforce standard forms given the many\nimportant functions they serve, from allowing large organizations to\nsolve agency problems to saving the consumer costs associated with\nbargaining over low probability events (Rakoff 1983: 1220\u20131245).\nAnglo-American contract law has long recognized a category of\n\u201cas if\u201d or \u201cquasi-contracts\u201d (see, e.g.,\nBaily v. West (1969)) whose enforcement is justified on\nexceptional, non-promissory grounds. That is, the law acknowledges\ncases where promissory intent may be lacking but duties of a\ncontractual form are imposed anyway. In a paradigm case, justification\nis said to reside in hypothetical consent: an unconscious patient who\nreceives life-saving treatment from a physician without previously\nconsenting owes remunerative duties on a quasi-contractual basis\ninsofar as the patient would have consented if she could have. The law\ndoes not subsume standard forms under the category of quasi-contracts.\nOn the contrary, the law enforces standard forms as bona fide\nagreements.\n\nA natural thought is that the basis for contractual obligation may be\nfound in a vague promissory intention. Most promises leave room for\nfurther specification while still being sufficiently specific to\nproduce reasonable reliance. Sam promises to help Susan move homes but\nwithout specifying whether he intends to labor personally or pay a\nmover. Sam incurs a general duty owed to Susan that can be variously\nsatisfied. Modern contract law, moreover, is quite comfortable with\nfilling in gaps in incomplete contracts (for example, imputing a\nmarket price where no price is mentioned: UCC: \u00a7 2-204(3)) and\nrendering vague terms precise (for example, fixing the payment meant\nby an employer\u2019s promise of \u201creasonable recognition\u201d\nfor inventions made by an employee, see Corthell v. Summit Thread\nCo. (1933)). A consumer\u2019s intention in agreeing to a form\ncontract may be some underspecified form of compliance with its terms,\nwhich the law can render precise as it usually does.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that agents are usually able to\nprecisely state the contents of a vague promise when invited to do so,\nwhereas the average consumer, having never read a standard form, is\nhardly in the same position. More generally, even vague promissory\nintentions must satisfy minimal criteria for being an intention. On\nthe simplest analysis of prospective intention, to intend an action is\nto believe that one will perform it and to have an appropriate guiding\ndesire (Audi 1973, 395; cf. Harman 1976; Davis 1984). That consumers\nform beliefs about all their contractually contemplated future actions\nwhen they agree to a form contract seems questionable. On an\nalternative picture, intentions are a distinctive mental state (not\nreducible to beliefs or desires) with a unique functional role of\nguiding and controlling the agent\u2019s behavior as well as her\nreasoning (Bratman 1987: 20; see, more generally, the entry on\n intention).\n Whether the average consumer forms any such future-directed, action-\nor reasoning-guiding mental state when she agrees to a standard form\nis similarly doubtful.\n\nBarnett (2002) suggests that the puzzle is best addressed by shifting\nfrom a promissory theory of contracts to an adjacent consent-based\ntheory (Barnett 1986). While the concepts of consent and promise fall\nin the same normative family (Hurd 1996), the criteria for consent may\nbe less demanding. Nevertheless, the view confronts parallel worries,\nsince what was consented-to remains opaque. Barnett suggests that a\nconsumer\u2019s consent is limited to those terms that are not\nradically unexpected (637), but the basis for such empirical\nassumptions about consumer intent remains unclear. It is doubtful that\nthe average consumer considers the question of what, if anything, she\nis consenting to when she mindlessly clicks \u201cI agree\u201d\n(Radin 2007; 2014; Kar & Radin 2019). Ultimately, the problem is\nnot even due to standard forms including standard(or non-bespoke)\nterms or the terms being unread by the consumer. The problem stems\ndirectly from the fact that the consumer\u2019s actions in virtue of\nwhich the law finds an intention to be bound appear\nthoughtless\u2014that is, lacking in intentionality.\n\nThe point of the discussion is not to critique the orthodox view of\ncontracts as promissory (or chosen) obligation (for general\ncriticisms, see\n \u00a71.1),\n but to suggest that the standard picture needs an account of\nprospective intention. Not just any view of what an intention is fits\nboth the standard picture and modern legal practice. It may be that an\nagent\u2019s intention, in the relevant contractual sense, is\nrevealed not by her articulable beliefs or action-guiding attitudes in\nthe moment, but her unconscious dispositions. Given that most\nconsumers comply with standard forms without contesting their\nvalidity, this general fact about consumer behavior might make it\nreasonable to impute a disposition to be bound. On the other hand,\nbehavioral research suggests that people \u201care more likely to\ncomply with contracts they participated in negotiating\u201d (Eigen\n2012: 67). At the same time, a consumer\u2019s reasons for complying\nin subsequent disputes may be entirely disconnected from her original\nintentions. The view risks conflating the fact that a person\u2019s\ncompliance is predictable ex ante with the fact that she intends to\ncomply. If these and other challenges can be overcome, however, then a\ndispositional theory of contractual intention may offer a better fit\nwith orthodox contract theory and modern practice than the available\nalternatives.\n",
