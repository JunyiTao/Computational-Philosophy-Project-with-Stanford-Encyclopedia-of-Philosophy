    "main_text": "Pre-Prison Journalism and Political Writings || Cultural Socialism\n2.1 Cultural Socialism\n\nGramsci\u2019s early writing was informed by the influential critical\nframework of the neo-Hegelian philosopher Benedetto Croce. Croce had\ndenounced scientific positivism\u2014prevalent among social\nscientists and European Marxists\u2014for its abstract, ahistorical\nreasoning and emphasis on material \u201ccauses\u201d in social\nchange. Positivism neglected the historically particular and\npractically creative dimension of \u201cspirit\u201d (or\nconsciousness) which, beyond any political program, motivated all\nsocial and cultural transformation. Croce invited a view of\nItaly\u2019s political failings as the absence of a robust, unifying\nculture\u2014a secular civic faith\u2014rather than economic\nunderdevelopment as such (see Croce 1914). He inspired numerous\n\u201caesthetic\u201d critics of the liberal state to understand\nsocio-political improvement as inseparable from free artistic\nself-creation, the assertion of moral will, and the cultivation of a\nshared \u201cinner\u201d sensibility.\n\nGramsci admitted later to having been \u201ctendentially somewhat\nCrocean\u201d in his early writing (FSPN: 355). For example, he\nendorsed the acquisition by workers of a \u201cfaith\u201d based on\nintellectual self-discipline and independence of thought, severely\ncastigating any tendency to passive \u201cindifference\u201d (SPWI:\n17\u201318). Echoing Sorel, whose writings Croce had championed, he\npresented socialism not as the outcome of historical\n\u201claws\u201d but as \u201can integral vision of life\u201d,\nthe adoption of an invigorating, moral consciousness to supplant the\nfailed bourgeois order (SCW: 22). In 1917 he welcomed the Russian\nRevolution as the \u201crevolution against Capital\u201d, viewing it\nnot as proof of Marx\u2019s economic theories but as evidence of the\npractical force of a collective will (SPWI: 34\u20137). Later, in\n1918, Gramsci offered his own idealist version of Marx, imagined as\n\u201ca master of moral and spiritual life\u201d teaching the\nproletariat to become consciously aware of \u201cits power and\nmission\u201d in history (PPW: 57, 56).\n\nThis somewhat ascetic, pedagogic humanism distinguished the young\nGramsci from other socialists who appealed to historical progress or\ninvested in the slow, practical advance of trade unionism and\napplication of scientific reason. Gramsci regarded such appeals as\nrooted in an elitist attitude aimed at bringing reform to the masses\nfrom on-high. Instead, he endorsed a grass-roots self-organization\nthat underscored the integrity and moral autonomy of a uniquely\nproletarian worldview. This placed him closer to other radical critics\nof the PSI, such as anarchists and syndicalists who also looked to a\nlibertarian politics \u201cfrom below\u201d (see Levy 1999).\n",
