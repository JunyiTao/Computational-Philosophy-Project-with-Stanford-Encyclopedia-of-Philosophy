    "main_text": "Inductive Logic and the Re-Emergence of the Theoretical Language || Return to the Theoretical Language\n8.3 Return to the Theoretical Language\n\nAs we saw in\n section 6.1,\n by the late 1930s Carnap had returned to a consideration of\ntheoretical languages whose primitive terms are not constructed\nbottom-up from observation sentences at all but entirely top-down,\n\u201cfloating in the air, so to speak\u201d so that these basic\ntheoretical terms can have \u201conly an indirect\ninterpretation, which is incomplete in a certain sense\u201d\n(Carnap 1939: 65). In Carnap\u2019s mind, the question of\nconfirmation of theories and the question of the empirical content of\ntheories were directly and inseparably connected, as they had been in\n\u201cTestability and Meaning\u201d. In this subsequent work on\nthese two questions, however, they were pursued separately, and for\nall of Carnap\u2019s efforts, the two strands could not be joined up.\nHis inductive logic was never able to assign a degree of confirmation\nother than zero to unrestricted universally quantified theories, which\nwas obviously a defect of the theory and was seized upon by Popper as\ndiscrediting the entire enterprise (e.g., Popper 1963). Carnap\u2019s\nown way around the problem was to argue that scientists often regard\nthe degree by which a piece of evidence E confirms a\nuniversal law hypothesis \\(\\forall x P(x)\\) to be given by the degree\nto which E confirms an \u201carbitrary\u201d instance of\nthe law \\(P(a)\\), where a is an individual constant that does\nnot occur in E: see Carnap (1945b: \u00a714). Later authors\ntried to repair the defect in alternative ways, with varying degrees\nof success; see the supplement\n Inductive Logic.\n On the other hand, though Carnap\u2019s work on the empirical\ncontent of sentences in a theoretical language often discusses the\nrelations between observational language and theoretical language, he\nwas never quite able to spell out a criterion for empirically\nmeaningful sentences in the theoretical language that did not fall\nprey to fairly straightforward criticism (e.g., Kaplan 1975). The\ngrand design of connecting up the projects of explicating confirmation\nand of reconstructing scientific theoretical language remained a\ndistant goal.\n\nWe have already surveyed the inductive-logic side in the previous\n section 8.2.\n On the theoretical-language side, Carnap\u2019s first major paper\nwas \u201cThe methodological character of theoretical concepts\u201d\n(Carnap 1956a), followed by \u201cObservation language and\ntheoretical language\u201d (Carnap 1958) and \u201cTheoretical\nconcepts in science\u201d (1959a). Carnap also touches on theoretical\nlanguages in several parts of the Schilpp volume (1963).\nPhilosophical Foundations of Physics (1966), finally, is a\nredaction by Martin Gardner of a class Carnap gave at UCLA in the late\n1950s, presented as an introductory textbook in the philosophy of\nscience. Among other things, it gives a lucid summary of\nCarnap\u2019s mature views on the reconstruction of scientific\ntheories. See the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Sections 3\u20135)\n for details and criticism.\n\nOne common misunderstanding of Carnap\u2019s work on the theoretical\nlanguage is an extension of the above-discussed misunderstandings of\nthe Aufbau\n (section 3\n above). The Aufbau was traditionally perceived as an\nexercise in providing phenomenalist or empiricist foundations for\nscientific sentences. Therefore, it was assumed, the later work on\nboth inductive logic and the theoretical language must be motivated by\nthe aim of providing empiricist foundations for scientific sentences,\nto distinguish them from non-scientific, i.e., metaphysical sentences.\nThis was certainly Popper\u2019s view, for instance, and largely\nQuine\u2019s, but they were not alone; it was widespread until the\n1990s, when the new and more careful scholarship about logical\nempiricism began to take hold.\n\nIt is true, of course, that in Carnap\u2019s later work on scientific\ntheories and theoretical languages, he distinguishes between a\ntheoretical language and an observation language, and studied the\nrelations between them. What is often overlooked, though, is that even\nin the Aufbau (and even in the earliest proto-Aufbau\nmanuscripts) Carnap was very clear that what we are to take as\n\u201cthe given\u201d is not inherently fixed or given by\nnature (as Aristotle would have put it), but something we have to\ndecide on, something we have to specify provisionally in our\nchosen form of rational reconstruction. Later Carnap became even\nclearer that what we choose to regard as \u201cobservation\nsentences\u201d is purpose-relative and can\u2019t be decided once\nfor all contexts, in the abstract. As early as \u201cTestability and\nMeaning\u201d (TM1: \u00a716) Carnap was saying that \u201cthere can\nbe several and even mutually exclusive bases\u201d for confirmation\nby observation. And in later work on the theoretical language this\npluralism is extended; in \u201cThe methodological character of\ntheoretical concepts\u201d he merely enumerates various possible\nrequirements of different kinds and strengths that might be imposed on\nthe observation language.\n\nIn Carnap\u2019s view, the choice of the theoretical language depends\non the purpose. The boundary between \u201cobservational\u201d and\n\u201ctheoretical\u201d terms, likewise, is relative to the language\nchosen and not fixed by nature:\n\n\nno sharp boundary separates the O-terms from the\nT-terms. The choice of an exact dividing line is somewhat\narbitrary. From a practical point of view, however, the distinction is\nusually evident. (Carnap 1966: 258)\n\n\nObservational terms are assumed to be fully interpreted; their\nspecification comes with an explicit link to observation (precisely\ndefined in some way), while theoretical terms are specified\naxiomatically and are, in the first instance, uninterpreted or only\nmathematically interpreted formulas. These formulas can then be\nendowed with physical (or chemical, or biological, or social)\ninterpretations by means of correspondence rules, which logically\nrelate observation terms and theoretical terms.\n\nCarnap\u2019s views on the theoretical language during this period\ndeveloped in response to critiques and commentaries from (as well as\npersonal correspondence with) C.G. Hempel (1945, 1958, 1963). One\nresponse to these interactions was Carnap\u2019s adoption of an idea\nfirst suggested by Frank Ramsey (1929) for the purpose of separating\nthe theoretical from the empirical content of a theory; this idea\nfirst appeared in print in (the original German version of)\nCarnap\u2019s paper \u201cObservation language and theoretical\nlanguage\u201d (1958). (This procedure is explained in detail in the\nsupplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Sections 4\u20136).)\n The idea was that a theory could essentially be stated in such a way\nthat all the theoretical terms in it are eliminated, i.e., it could be\nstated solely in terms of its \u201cempirical residue\u201d. But\nCarnap\u2019s goal in adopting this method was not to suggest that\nthe theoretical language was eliminable, that theoretical terms could\nor should be eliminated (as some versions of traditional empiricism\nmight have liked). The point was rather to understand the empirical\ncontent of theoretical claims, and its logical function within\ntheories. This leads to many complications, which are still very much\nunder discussion (e.g., Demopoulos 2007, Friedman 2011, Schurz\n2005).\n\nThe Ramsey approach was adopted, following Carnap, by others, notably\nDavid Lewis (1970), who put it to a rather different, more\nmetaphysical use that was later adopted by Frank Jackson and other\nadvocates of the \u201cCanberra Plan\u201d of conceptual analysis.\nThis was also Chalmers\u2019s (2012) point of departure, in his more\nmetaphysical adaptation of the Aufbau, mentioned above\n (section 3).\n See the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 4).\n",
