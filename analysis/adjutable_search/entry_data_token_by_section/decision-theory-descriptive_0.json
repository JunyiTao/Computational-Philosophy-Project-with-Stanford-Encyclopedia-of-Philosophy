    "main_text": "The Standard Model: Subjective Expected Utility\n1. The Standard Model: Subjective Expected Utility\n\nThe canonical theory of choice\u2014Subjective Expected\nUtility (SEU)\u2014owes its inception to the work of Savage\n(1954), building on previous contributions by De Finetti (1937),\nRamsey (1931) and von Neumann and Morgenstern (1947). It offers a\nhomogenous treatment of both decisions under\n\u201crisk\u201d\u2014situations in which the decision\nmaker has knowledge of, or holds firm beliefs regarding, the objective\nprobabilities of all events pertinent to the success of his or her\nactions\u2014and decisions under\n\u201cuncertainty\u201d\u2014in which he or she does not.\nIn its non-normative incarnation, it proposes at the very least that\nagents can be described as if:\n\nassociating with the possible consequences of the acts available\nto them two numerical quantities:\n\n\na \u201cutility\u201d corresponding to the degree to\nwhich they would desire the outcome to occur and\na \u201csubjective probability\u201d corresponding to\ntheir degree of confidence in the occurrence of the outcome given the\nperformance of the act, a degree of confidence which may or may not be\ngiven by a corresponding assessment of objective probabilities;\n\nbeing such that their preferences between acts, and hence their\ndispositions to chose certain acts over others, are determined by\nthese quantities in such a way that acts are ranked by their\nsubjective expected utility, i.e., the subjective\nprobability-weighted sum of the utilities of their possible\noutcomes.\n\n\nOntologically bolder incarnations of the view have it that agents are\nso describable because they really do have degrees of belief\nand desires, introspectively familiar psychological states, that\ndetermine their preferences and choices in such a manner.\n\nA number of important formal results, known as \u201crepresentation\ntheorems\u201d, show that this claim about describability can be\nderived from a set of prima facie plausible general\nprinciples, aka \u201cpostulates\u201d or \u201caxioms\u201d,\npertaining to the agents\u2019 preferences over acts. Furthermore,\nnot only are these axioms collectively sufficient to derive\nSEU\u2019s claim, but a significant proper subset of them also turn\nout to be individually necessary. Unsurprisingly then, much\nof the work on assessing the empirical adequacy of SEU has focused on\nthe testing of the aforementioned axioms. Such tests could, in the\nbest case, undermine a key reason to endorse the claim and, in the\nworst, provide grounds to reject it. Accordingly, a brief sketch of\nSavage\u2019s own early result is in order.\n",
