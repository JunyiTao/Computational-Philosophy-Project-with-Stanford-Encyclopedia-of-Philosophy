Individuation of bodies and the variety in matter\n\nWhile Descartes does claim (at least most of the time) that individual\nbodies are distinct substances, he does not invoke this claim in his\nofficial account of the individuation of bodies. The account he does\noffer is highly problematic. Descartes holds \u201call the variety in\nmatter, and all the diversity of its forms, depends on motion\u201d\n(Principles 2.23). Thus the distinction between bodies is\nconstituted of distinctions in the motions of regions of extension. On\nthe other hand, Descartes defines motion \u201cin the strict sense of\nthe term\u201d, as the relative change of position of a body relative\nto those bodies with which it is immediate contact\n(Principles 2.25). The circularity here is obvious, and\ncrippling. Diversity and variety of bodies depends on motion, but\nmotion depends upon a prior distinction between bodies.\n\nThat Spinoza was aware of the problem Descartes' views had accounting\nfor variety in extension is clear: in the late and much discussed\nletter 83 to Tschirnhaus, Spinoza writes,\n\nWith regard to your question as to whether the variety of things can\nbe demonstrated a priori solely from the conception of Extension, I\nbelieve I have already shown sufficiently clearly that this is\nimpossible, and that therefore Descartes is wrong in defining matter\nthrough extension; it must be explicated through an attribute that\nexpresses eternal and infinite essence.\n\n\nSpinoza goes on to express the hope that he may live long enough to\ndiscuss these matter more clearly, since \u201cthere has been no\nopportunity \u2026 to arrange these matters in proper order.\u201d\nHe died before the opportunity arose.\n",
