Life\n\nJohn Austin\u2019s life (1790\u20131859) was filled with\ndisappointment and unfulfilled expectations. His influential friends\n(who included Jeremy Bentham, James Mill, John Stuart Mill and Thomas\nCarlyle) were impressed by his intellect and his conversation, and\npredicted he would go far. However, in public dealings, Austin\u2019s\nnervous disposition, shaky health, tendency towards melancholy, and\nperfectionism combined to end quickly careers at the Bar, in academia,\nand in government service (Hamburger 1985, 1992).\n\nAustin was born to a Suffolk merchant family, and served briefly in\nthe military before beginning his legal training. He was called to the\nBar in 1818, but he took on few cases, and quit the practice of law in\n1825. Austin shortly thereafter obtained an appointment to the first\nChair of Jurisprudence at the recently established University of\nLondon. He prepared for his lectures by study in Bonn, and evidence of\nthe influence of continental legal and political ideas can be found\nscattered throughout Austin\u2019s writings. Commentators have found\nevidence in Austin\u2019s writings of the German Pandectist treatment\nof Roman Law, in particular, its approach to law as something that is,\nor should be, systematic and coherent (Schwarz 1934; Stein 1988: pp.\n223\u2013229, 238\u2013244; Lobban 1991: pp. 223\u2013256, Lobban\n2013).\n\nLectures from the course he gave were eventually published in 1832 as\n\u201cProvince of Jurisprudence Determined\u201d (Austin 1832).\nHowever, attendance at his courses was small and getting smaller, and\nhe gave his last lecture in 1833. A short-lived effort to give a\nsimilar course of lectures at the Inner Temple met the same result.\nAustin resigned his University of London Chair in 1835. He later\nbriefly served on the Criminal Law Commission, and as a Royal\nCommissioner to Malta, but he never found either success or\ncontentment. He did some occasional writing on political themes, but\nhis plans for longer works never came to anything during his lifetime,\ndue apparently to some combination of perfectionism, melancholy, and\nwriter\u2019s block. His changing views on moral, political, and\nlegal matters also apparently hindered both the publication of a\nrevised edition of \u201cProvince of Jurisprudence Determined,\u201d\nand the completion of a longer project started when his views had been\ndifferent.\n\n(Some scholars have argued that Austin may have moved away from\nanalytical jurisprudence (see below) towards something more\napproximating the historical jurisprudence school; cf. Hamburger 1985:\npp. 178\u201391, arguing for Austin\u2019s views having changed\nsignificantly, with Rumble 2013, arguing against that view.)\n\nMuch of whatever success Austin found during his life, and after, must\nbe attributed to his wife Sarah, for her tireless support, both moral\nand economic (during the later years of their marriage, they lived\nprimarily off her efforts as a translator and reviewer), and her work\nto publicize his writings after his death (including the publication\nof a more complete set of his Lectures on Jurisprudence) (Austin\n1879). Credit should also be given to Austin\u2019s influential\nfriends, who not only helped him to secure many of the positions he\nheld during his lifetime, but also gave important support for his\nwritings after his death (Hamburger 1985: pp. 33, 197; Morison 1982:\np. 17; Mill 1863).\n\nAustin\u2019s work was influential in the decades after his passing\naway (Rumble 2005); this influence was in part due to the restatement\nof is ideas by other thinkers, like T. E. Holland (Postema 2011: p.\n4). E. C. Clark wrote in the late 19th century that Austin\u2019s\nwork \u201cis undoubtedly forming a school of English jurists,\npossibly of English legislators also. It is the staple of\njurisprudence in all our systems of legal education\u201d (Clark\n1883: pp. 4\u20135). A similar assessment is made by H.L.A. Hart,\nlooking back nearly a century later: \u201cwithin a few years of his\ndeath it was clear that his work had established the study of\njurisprudence in England\u201d (Hart 1955: p. xvi). As will be\ndiscussed, Austin\u2019s influence can be seen at a number of levels,\nincluding the general level of how legal theory, and law generally,\nwere taught (Stein 1988: pp. 238\u2013244), and the use of an\nanalytical approach in legal theory. At such levels, Austin\u2019s\nimpact is felt to this day. Hart could write that\n\u201cAustin\u2019s influence on the development of England of\n[Jurisprudence] has been greater than that of any other writer,\u201d\n(Hart 1955: p. xvi) even while Austin\u2019s particular command\ntheory of law became almost friendless, and is today probably best\nknown from Hart\u2019s use of it (1958: 602\u2013606, 2012:\n18\u201325) as a foil for the elaboration of Hart\u2019s own, more\nnuanced approach to legal theory. In recent decades, some theorists\nhave revisited Austin\u2019s command theory (and other works),\noffering new characterizations and defenses of his ideas (e.g.,\nMorison 1982, Rumble 1985, see generally Freeman & Mindus\n2013).\n2. Analytical Jurisprudence and Legal Positivism\n\nEarly in his career, Austin came under the influence of Jeremy\nBentham, and Bentham\u2019s utilitarianism is evident (though with\nsome differences) in the work for which Austin is best known today. On\nAustin\u2019s reading of utilitarianism, Divine will is equated with\nUtilitarian principles: \u201cThe commands which God has revealed we\nmust gather from the terms wherein they are promulg[ate]d. The command\nwhich he has not revealed, we must construe by the principle of\nutility\u201d (Austin 1873: Lecture IV, p. 160; see also Austin 1832:\nLecture II, p. 41). This particular reading of utilitarianism,\nhowever, has had little long-term influence, though it seems to have\nbeen the part of his work that received the most attention in his own\nday (Rumble 1995: p. xx). Some have also seen Austin as being one of\nthe early advocates of \u201crule utilitarianism\u201d (e.g., Austin\n1832: Lecture II, p. 42, where Austin urges that we analyze not the\nutility of particular acts, but that of \u201cclass[es] of\naction\u201d). Additionally, Austin early on shared many of the ideas\nof the Benthamite philosophical radicals; he was \u201ca strong\nproponent of modern political economy, a believer in Hartleian\nmetaphysics, and a most enthusiastic Malthusian\u201d (Rumble 1985:\npp. 16\u201317). Austin was to lose most of his \u201cradical\u201d\ninclinations as he grew older.\n\nAustin\u2019s importance to legal theory lies elsewhere\u2014his\ntheorizing about law was novel at four different levels of generality.\nFirst, he was arguably the first writer to approach the theory of law\nanalytically (as contrasted with approaches to law more grounded in\nhistory or sociology, or arguments about law that were secondary to\nmore general moral and political theories). Analytical jurisprudence\nemphasizes the analysis of key concepts, including \u201claw,\u201d\n\u201c(legal) right,\u201d \u201c(legal) duty,\u201d and\n\u201clegal validity.\u201d Though analytical jurisprudence has been\nchallenged by some in recent years (e.g., Leiter 2007, Leiter and\nEtchemendy 2021, Postema 2021 [Other Internet Resources]), it remains\nthe dominant approach to discussing the nature of law. Analytical\njurisprudence, an approach to theorizing about law, has sometimes been\nconfused with what the American legal realists (an influential group\nof theorists prominent in the early decades of the 20th century)\ncalled \u201clegal formalism\u201d\u2014a narrow approach to how\njudges should decide cases. The American legal realists saw Austin in\nparticular, and analytical jurisprudence in general, as their\nopponents in their critical and reform-minded efforts (e.g., Sebok\n1998: pp. 65\u201369). In this, the realists were simply mistaken;\nunfortunately, it is a mistake that can still be found in some\ncontemporary legal commentators (see Bix 1999, 903\u2013919, for\ndocumentation).\n\nSecond, Austin\u2019s work should be seen against a background where\nmost English judges and commentators saw common-law reasoning (the\nincremental creation or modification of law through judicial\nresolution of particular disputes) as supreme, as declaring existing\nlaw, as discovering the requirements of \u201cReason,\u201d as the\nimmemorial wisdom of popular \u201ccustom.\u201d Such\n(Anglo-American) theories about common law reasoning fit with a larger\ntradition of theorizing about law (which had strong roots in\ncontinental European thought\u2014e.g., the historical jurisprudence\nof theorists like Karl Friedrich von Savigny (1975)): the idea that\ngenerally law did or should reflect community mores,\n\u201cspirit,\u201d or custom. In general, one might look at many of\nthe theorists prior to Austin as exemplifying an approach that was\nmore \u201ccommunity-oriented\u201d\u2014law as arising from\nsocietal values or needs, or expressive of societal customs or\nmorality. By contrast, Austin\u2019s is one of the first, and one of\nthe most distinctive, theories that views law as being \u201cimperium\noriented\u201d\u2014viewing law as mostly the rules imposed from\nabove from certain authorized (pedigreed) sources. More\n\u201ctop-down\u201d theories of law, like that of Austin, better\nfit the more centralized governments (and the modern political\ntheories about government) of modern times (Cotterrell 2003: pp.\n21\u201377).\n\nThird, within analytical jurisprudence, Austin was the first\nsystematic exponent of a view of law known as \u201clegal\npositivism.\u201d Most of the important theoretical work on law prior\nto Austin had treated jurisprudence as though it were merely a branch\nof moral theory or political theory: asking how should the state\ngovern? (and when were governments legitimate?), and under what\ncircumstances did citizens have an obligation to obey the law? Austin\nspecifically, and legal positivism generally, offered a quite\ndifferent approach to law: as an object of \u201cscientific\u201d\nstudy (Austin 1879: pp. 1107\u20131108), dominated neither by\nprescription nor by moral evaluation. Subtle jurisprudential questions\naside, Austin\u2019s efforts to treat law systematically gained\npopularity in the late 19th century among English lawyers who wanted\nto approach their profession, and their professional training, in a\nmore serious and rigorous manner (Hart 1955: pp. xvi\u2013xviii;\nCotterrell 2003: pp. 74\u201377; Stein 1988: pp. 231\u2013244).\n\nLegal positivism asserts (or assumes) that it is both possible and\nvaluable to have a morally neutral descriptive (or\n\u201cconceptual\u201d\u2014though this is not a term Austin used)\ntheory of law. (The main competitor to legal positivism, in\nAustin\u2019s day as in our own, has been natural law theory.) Legal\npositivism does not deny that moral and political criticism of legal\nsystems is important, but insists that a descriptive or conceptual\napproach to law is valuable, both on its own terms and as a necessary\nprelude to criticism.\n\n(The term \u201clegal positivism\u201d is sometimes used more\nbroadly to include the position that we should construct or modify our\nconcept of law to remove moral criteria of legal validity; or to\ninclude a prescription that moral values should not be used in\njudicial decision-making (Schauer 2010\u2014see the Other Internet\nResources). I do not think anything turns on whether the term is used\nmore broadly or more narrowly, as long as it is clear which sense is\nbeing used. Additionally, while Schauer claims (2010) that Austin\ncould be seen as supporting some of the views associated with the\nbroader understanding of \u201clegal positivism\u201d, there is need\nfor more evidence and argument before the point should be\ngranted.)\n\nThere were theorists prior to Austin who arguably offered views\nsimilar to legal positivism or who at least foreshadowed legal\npositivism in some way. Among these would be Thomas Hobbes, with his\namoral view of laws as the product of Leviathan (Hobbes 1996); David\nHume, with his argument for separating \u201cis\u201d and\n\u201cought\u201d (which has been taken by some as a sharp criticism\nfor some forms of natural law theory, those views that purported to\nderive moral truths from statements about human nature, Hume 1739,\nSection 3.1.1, but see Chilovi and Wodak 2021, raising questions about\nthe relevance of Hume\u2019s views here for either natural law theory\nor legal positivism); and Jeremy Bentham, with his attacks on judicial\nlawmaking and on those commentators, like Sir William Blackstone, who\njustified such lawmaking with natural-law-like justifications (Bentham\n1789).\n\nAustin\u2019s famous formulation of what could be called the\n\u201cdogma\u201d of legal positivism is as follows:\n\nThe existence of law is one thing; its merit or demerit is another.\nWhether it be or be not is one enquiry; whether it be or be not\nconformable to an assumed standard, is a different enquiry. A law,\nwhich actually exists, is a law, though we happen to dislike it, or\nthough it vary from the text, by which we regulate our approbation and\ndisapprobation. (Austin 1832: Lecture V, p. 157)\n\n\n(While Austin saw himself as criticizing natural law theory, a view\nshared by most of the legal positivists who followed him, the extent\nto which the two schools disagree, and the location of their\ndisagreement, remains a matter sharply contested (e.g., Finnis 2000a,\n2000b.))\n\nAndrew Halpin has argued (Halpin 2013) that Austin shaped the nature\nof modern analytical jurisprudence and legal positivism by his choice\nto exclude legal reasoning from his discussion of\n\u201cjurisprudence.\u201d A greater focus on legal reasoning,\nHalpin argues, would have made it harder to claim a clear separation\nof law \u201cas it is\u201d and law \u201cas it ought to be.\u201d\nHalpin points out that prominent later legal positivists have followed\nAustin, either in speaking little about legal reasoning (Hans Kelsen,\nand, to some extent, H. L. A. Hart), or speaking about the topic at\nlength, but treating the issue as sharply separate from their theories\nof (the nature of) law.\n\nFourth, Austin\u2019s version of legal positivism, a \u201ccommand\ntheory of law\u201d (which will be detailed in the next section), was\nalso, for a time, quite influential. Austin\u2019s theory had\nsimilarities with views developed by Jeremy Bentham, whose theory\ncould also be characterized as a \u201ccommand theory.\u201d\nBentham, in a posthumously published work, defined law as an:\n\nassemblage of signs declarative of a volition conceived or adopted by\nthe sovereign in a state, concerning the conduct to be\nobserved in a certain case by a certain person or class of\npersons, who in the case in question are or are supposed to be subject\nto his power: such volition trusting for its accomplishment to the\nexpectation of certain events which it is intended such declaration\nshould upon occasion be a means of bringing to pass, and the prospect\nof which it is intended should act as a motive upon those whose\nconduct is in question (Bentham 1970: p. 1).\n\n\nHowever, Austin\u2019s command theory was more influential than\nBentham\u2019s, because the latter\u2019s jurisprudential writings\ndid not appear in an even-roughly systematic form until well after\nAustin\u2019s work had already been published, with Bentham\u2019s\nmost systematic discussion only appearing posthumously, late in the\n20th century (Bentham 1970, 1996; Cotterrell 2003: p. 50).\n3. Austin\u2019s Views\n\nAustin\u2019s basic approach was to ascertain what can be said\ngenerally, but still with interest, about all laws. Austin\u2019s\nanalysis can be seen as either a paradigm of, or a caricature of,\nanalytical philosophy, in that his discussions are dryly full of\ndistinctions, but are thin in argument. The modern reader is forced to\nfill in much of the meta-theoretical, justificatory work, as it cannot\nbe found in the text. Where Austin does articulate his methodology and\nobjective, it is a fairly traditional one: he \u201cendeavored to\nresolve a law (taken with the largest signification which can\nbe given to that term properly) into the necessary and\nessential elements of which it is composed\u201d (Austin 1832:\nLecture V, p. 117).\n\nAs to what is the core nature of law, Austin\u2019s answer is that\nlaws (\u201cproperly so called\u201d) are commands of a sovereign.\nHe clarifies the concept of positive law (that is, man-made law) by\nanalyzing the constituent concepts of his definition, and by\ndistinguishing law from other concepts that are similar:\n\n\n\n\u201cCommands\u201d involve an expressed wish that something be\ndone, combined with a willingness and ability to impose \u201can\nevil\u201d if that wish is not complied with. \n\n\nRules are general commands (applying generally to a class), as\ncontrasted with specific or individual commands (\u201cdrink wine\ntoday\u201d or \u201cJohn Major must drink wine\u201d). \n\n\nPositive law consists of those commands laid down by a sovereign (or\nits agents), to be contrasted to other law-givers, like God\u2019s\ngeneral commands, and the general commands of an employer to an\nemployee. \n\n\nThe \u201csovereign\u201d is defined as a person (or determinate\nbody of persons) who receives habitual obedience from the bulk of the\npopulation, but who does not habitually obey any other (earthly)\nperson or institution. Austin thought that all independent political\nsocieties, by their nature, have a sovereign. \n\n\nPositive law should also be contrasted with \u201claws by a close\nanalogy\u201d (which includes positive morality, laws of honor,\ninternational law, customary law, and constitutional law) and\n\u201claws by remote analogy\u201d (e.g., the laws of physics).\n\n(Austin 1832: Lecture I). \n\n\nAustin also included within \u201cthe province of\njurisprudence\u201d certain \u201cexceptions,\u201d items which did\nnot fit his criteria but which should nonetheless be studied with\nother \u201claws properly so called\u201d: repealing laws,\ndeclarative laws, and \u201cimperfect laws\u201d\u2014laws\nprescribing action but without sanctions (a concept Austin ascribes to\n\u201cRoman [law] jurists\u201d) (Austin 1832: Lecture I, p.\n36).\n\nIn the criteria set out above, Austin succeeded in delimiting law and\nlegal rules from religion, morality, convention, and custom. However,\nalso excluded from \u201cthe province of jurisprudence\u201d were\ncustomary law (except to the extent that the sovereign had, directly\nor indirectly, adopted such customs as law), public international law,\nand parts of constitutional law. (These exclusions alone would make\nAustin\u2019s theory problematic for most modern readers.)\n\nWithin Austin\u2019s approach, whether something is or is not\n\u201claw\u201d depends on which people have done what: the question\nturns on an empirical investigation, and it is a matter mostly of\npower, not of morality. Of course, Austin is not arguing that law\nshould not be moral, nor is he implying that it rarely is. Austin is\nnot playing the nihilist or the skeptic. He is merely pointing out\nthat there is much that is law that is not moral, and what makes\nsomething law does nothing to guarantee its moral value. \u201cThe\nmost pernicious laws, and therefore those which are most opposed to\nthe will of God, have been and are continually enforced as laws by\njudicial tribunals\u201d (Austin 1832: Lecture V, p. 158).\n\nIn contrast to his mentor Bentham, Austin, in his early lectures,\naccepted judicial lawmaking as \u201chighly beneficial and even\nabsolutely necessary\u201d (Austin, 1832: Lecture V, p. 163). Nor did\nAustin find any difficulty incorporating judicial lawmaking into his\ncommand theory: he characterized that form of lawmaking, along with\nthe occasional legal/judicial recognition of customs by judges, as the\n\u201ctacit commands\u201d of the sovereign, the sovereign\u2019s\naffirming the \u201corders\u201d by its acquiescence (Austin 1832:\nLecture 1, pp. 35\u201336). It should be noted, however, that one of\nAustin\u2019s later lectures listed the many problems that can come\nwith judicial legislation, and recommended codification of the law\ninstead (Austin 1879: vol. 2, Lecture XXXIX, pp. 669\u2013704).\n4. Criticisms\n\nAs many readers come to Austin\u2019s theory mostly through its\ncriticism by other writers (prominently, that of H.L.A. Hart; see also\nKelsen 1941: 54\u201366), the weaknesses of the theory are almost\nbetter known than the theory itself:\n\nFirst, in many societies, it is hard to identify a\n\u201csovereign\u201d in Austin\u2019s sense of the word (a\ndifficulty Austin himself experienced, when he was forced to describe\nthe British \u201csovereign\u201d awkwardly as the combination of\nthe King, the House of Lords, and all the electors of the House of\nCommons). Additionally, a focus on a \u201csovereign\u201d makes it\ndifficult to explain the continuity of legal systems: a new ruler will\nnot come in with the kind of \u201chabit of obedience\u201d that\nAustin sets as a criterion for a system\u2019s rule-maker.\n\nA few responses are available to those who would defend Austin. First,\nsome commentators have argued that Austin is here misunderstood, in\nthat he always meant \u201cby the sovereign the office or\ninstitution which embodies supreme authority; never the\nindividuals who happen to hold that office or embody that institution\nat any given time\u201d (Cotterrell 2003: p. 63, footnote omitted);\nthere are certainly parts of Austin\u2019s lectures that support this\nreading (e.g., Austin 1832: Lecture V, pp. 128\u201329; Lecture VI,\np. 218).\n\nSecondly, one could argue (see Harris 1977) that the sovereign is best\nunderstood as a constructive metaphor: that law should be viewed as if\nit reflected the view of a single will (a similar view, that law\nshould be interpreted as if it derived from a single will, can be\nfound in Ronald Dworkin\u2019s work (1986: pp. 176\u2013190)).\n\nThirdly, one could argue that Austin\u2019s reference to a sovereign\nwhom others are in the habit of obeying but who is not in the habit of\nobeying anyone else, captures what a \u201crealist\u201d or\n\u201ccynic\u201d would call a basic fact of political life. There\nis, the claim goes, entities or factions in society that are not\neffectively constrained, or could act in an unconstrained way if they\nso chose. For one type of example, one could point out that if there\nwas a sufficiently large and persistent majority among the United\nStates electorate, nothing could contain them: they could elect\nPresidents and legislators who would amend the Constitution and,\nthrough those same officials, appoint judges who would interpret the\n(revised or original) Constitution in a way amenable to their\ninterests. A different sort of example (and some would say that there\nare recent real-life examples of this type) would be a President who\nignored the constraints of statutory law, constitutional law, and\ninternational treaty commitments, while the public and other officials\nlacked the will or the means to hold that President to the legal norms\nthat purported to constrain his or her actions.\n\nAs regards Austin\u2019s \u201ccommand\u201d model, it seems to fit\nsome aspects of law poorly (e.g., rules which grant powers to\nofficials and to private citizens\u2014of the latter, the rules for\nmaking wills, trusts, and contracts are examples), while excluding\nother matters (e.g., international law) which we are not inclined to\nexclude from the category \u201claw.\u201d\n\nMore generally, it seems more distorting than enlightening to reduce\nall legal rules to one type. For example, rules that empower people to\nmake wills and contracts perhaps can be re-characterized as\npart of a long chain of reasoning for eventually imposing a sanction\n(Austin spoke in this context of the sanction of \u201cnullity\u201d\n(Austin 1879: 522, 523, 923)) on those who fail to comply with the\nrelevant provisions. However, such a re-characterization misses the\nbasic purpose of those sorts of laws\u2014they are arguably about\ngranting power and autonomy, not punishing wrongdoing.\n\nA different criticism of Austin\u2019s command theory is that a\ntheory which portrays law solely in terms of power fails to\ndistinguish rules of terror from forms of governance sufficiently just\nthat they are accepted as legitimate (or at least as reasons for\naction) by their own citizens.\n\nFinally, one might note that the constitutive rules that determine who\nthe legal officials are and what procedures must be followed in\ncreating new legal rules, \u201care not commands habitually obeyed,\nnor can they be expressed as habits of obedience to persons\u201d\n(Hart 1958: p. 603).\n\nAustin was aware of some of these lines of attack, and had responses\nready; it is another matter whether his responses were adequate. It\nshould also be noted that Austin\u2019s work shows a silence on\nquestions of methodology, though this may be forgivable, given the\nearly stage of jurisprudence. As discussed in an earlier section, in\nmany ways, Austin was blazing a new path. On matters of methodology,\nlater commentators on Austin\u2019s work have had difficulty\ndetermining whether he is best understood as making empirical claims\nabout the law or conceptual claims; elements of each sort of approach\ncan be found in his writings (Lobban 1991: pp. 224\u2013225;\nCotterrell 2003: pp. 81\u201383).\n\nWhen H.L.A. Hart revived legal positivism in the middle of the\n20th century (Hart 1958, 2012), he did it by criticizing\nand building on Austin\u2019s theory: for example, Hart\u2019s\ntheory did not try to reduce all legal rules to one kind of rule, but\nemphasized the varying types and functions of legal rules; and\nHart\u2019s theory, grounded partly on the distinction between\n\u201cobligation\u201d and \u201cbeing obliged,\u201d was built\naround the fact that some participants within legal systems\n\u201caccepted\u201d the legal rules as reasons for action, above\nand beyond the fear of sanctions. Hart\u2019s\n\u201chermeneutic\u201d approach, building on the \u201cinternal\npoint of view\u201d of participants who accepted the legal system,\ndiverged sharply from Austin\u2019s approach to law.\n5. A Revisionist View?\n\nSome modern commentators appreciate in Austin elements that were\nprobably not foremost in his mind (or that of his contemporary\nreaders). For example, one occasionally sees Austin portrayed as the\nfirst \u201crealist\u201d: in contrast both to the theorists that\ncame before Austin and to some modern writers on law, Austin is seen\nas having a keener sense of the connection of law and power, and the\nimportance of keeping that connection at the forefront of analysis\n(cf. Cotterrell 2003: pp. 49\u201377). One commentator wrote:\n\nAustin\u2019s theory is not a theory of the Rule of Law: of\ngovernment subject to law. It is a theory of the \u2018rule of\nmen\u2019: of government using law as an instrument of power. Such a\nview may be considered realistic or merely cynical. But it is, in its\nbroad outlines, essentially coherent. (Cotterrell 2003: p. 70)\n\n\nWhen circumstances seem to warrant a more critical, skeptical or\ncynical approach to law and government, Austin\u2019s equation of law\nand force will be attractive\u2014however distant such a reading may\nbe from Austin\u2019s own liberal-utilitarian views at the time of\nhis writing, or his more conservative political views later in his\nlife (Hamburger, 1985).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Austin, John, 1832, <em>The Province of Jurisprudence\nDetermined</em>, W.
