The Dialectic of Technology\n\n\nIn their famous book Dialectic of Enlightenment\nMarcuse\u2019s colleagues Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno attempted\nto demonstrate that the Enlightenment embodied a tension between its own\nproject of liberation and its own new mechanisms of oppression and\ndomination. For Marcuse, modern technology (a product of the\nEnlightenment) embodies a similar tension. The question for him\nwas \u201cwhat role does technology play in the project of human\nemancipation?\u201d The technological boom has been supported by\nthe idea that there is some fundamental connection between\ntechnological development and the human quest for liberation and a\nbetter life. However, we were disabused of this idea by Freud and\nmany others. The question now is \u201cdoes technological\nadvance lead to more repression and domination?\u201d\n Marcuse\u2019s critical theory is always dialectical, as he\nexamines forms of oppression and domination while also, at the same,\nlooking for the potential for liberation. In an essay entitled\n\u201cSome Social Implications of Modern Technology\u201d written in\n1941, Marcuse makes an important distinction between technology and\ntechnics. He would continue to employ some version of this distinction\nfor the rest of his life when writing about technology. In this essay\nhe says:\n\n\nIn this article, technology is taken as a social process in which\ntechnics proper (that is, the technical apparatus of industry,\ntransportation, communication) is but a partial factor. We do not ask\nfor the influence or effect of technology on human individuals. For\nthey are themselves an integral part and factor of technology, not\nonly as the men who invent or attend to machinery but also as the\nsocial groups which direct its application and\nutilization. Technology, as a mode of production, as the totality of\ninstruments, devices and contrivances which characterize the machine\nage is thus at the same time a mode of organization and perpetuating\n(or changing) social relationships, a manifestation of prevalent\nthought and behavior patterns, an instrument for control and\ndomination. Technics by itself can promote authoritarianism as well as\nliberty, scarcity as well as abundance, the extension as well as the\nabolition of toil. (Marcuse 1998) \n\nOn the basis of the above passage it may sound as if technics is\nneutral as it can promote either oppression or liberation. \nHowever, this is not the case. Marcuse makes this clear in\nanother essay entitled \u201cThe Problem of Social Change in the\nTechnological Society\u201d written twenty years later. Also, in\na 1960 essay entitled \u201cFrom Ontology to Technology\u201d, using\nthe term \u201ctechnicity\u201d instead of \u201ctechnics\u201d he\nagain rejects the neutrality of technics or technicity. By\n\u201ctechnics\u201d, Marcuse means the devices or instruments that\nare used to transform nature in the service of human beings.\n\n\nTechnics is the methodological negation of nature by human\nthought and action. In this negation, natural conditions and\nrelations become instrumentalities for the preservation, enlargement,\nand refinement of human society. (Marcuse 2011: 45)\n\n By \u201cTechnology\u201d, Marcuse means the mode of production\nor the totality of instruments, devices, etc.\n\nIf technology refers to a mode of production or totality of\ninstruments, then as such it is situated within a certain ideological\nstructure, indeed, it is a form of ideology which determines the form\nof machinery for a particular form of production as well as that form\nof production itself. Here, \u201cideology\u201d simply refers\nto a belief system or a way of thinking which would include the\ntelos or purpose of all social thought and action.\n\nAt the level of technics, a machine can be considered neutral only\nas pure matter, but in a technological society no such machine exists,\nhence, technics is not neutral. Every machine is constituted\nwithin a web of social, political, economic meaning, an ensemble of\nsocial relations. Technics exists within a certain mode of\nproduction as well as in certain relations of production. Every\ntechnical item is given a mission and is to further the goals of the\npresent reality principle or capitalist performance principle. \nThere is a dialectic involved here insofar as even if modern technology\nhas its origin in a repressive, oppressive, capitalist reality\nprinciple, this same technology carries within itself other\npossibilities. \n\nMarcuse believed that it was possible to conceive of technology\nunder an entirely new reality principle. In the capitalist\nsystem, technics and its governing technological ideology is based on\nthe performance principle of competition and production and must serve\nthe goals set by this performance principle. Even if scarcity is\nno longer a real problem, the idea and fear of scarcity are taken up\nand put to work for the ideology of production for the sake of\nproduction and competition for the sake of competition. We are\nnever told that at this moment we have the necessary resources to end\nworld hunger. Instead, we are told that more and more\ntechnological progress will end the problem of scarcity. \n\nAccording to Marcuse, the use that is made of technology is\nideologically shaped by the present reality principle. It is this\noppressive/repressive reality principle that shapes the telos\nof technological development. Hence, neither technology nor\ntechnics can be neutral because the entire meaning and purpose of such\nhas its birth within a reality and performance principle that as\nMarcuse has reminded us, does not have the liberation and happiness of\nall human beings as its goal. The entire technological and\ntechnical apparatus is given its form and mission by the ruling\nclass. \n\nAccording to Marcuse, a new sensibility, that is, a reshaping of\nhuman relationships with each other as well as with nature would usher\nin a new reality principle. With this new reality principle would\ncome a new mission or telos for technology. Under this\nnew reality principle it would be unthinkable to associate\ntechnological progress with the building of bombs and more\nsophisticated instruments of death. \n",
