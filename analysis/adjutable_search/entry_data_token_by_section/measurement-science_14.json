    "main_text": "The Epistemology of Measurement\n8. The Epistemology of Measurement\n\nThe development of model-based accounts discussed in the previous\nsection is part of a larger, \u201cepistemic turn\u201d in the\nphilosophy of measurement that occurred in the early 2000s. Rather\nthan emphasizing the mathematical foundations, metaphysics or\nsemantics of measurement, philosophical work in recent years tends to\nfocus on the presuppositions and inferential patterns involved in\nconcrete practices of measurement, and on the historical, social and\nmaterial dimensions of measuring. The philosophical study of these\ntopics has been referred to as the \u201cepistemology of\nmeasurement\u201d (Mari 2003, 2005a; Lepl\u00e8ge 2003; Tal 2017a).\nIn the broadest sense, the epistemology of measurement is the study of\nthe relationships between measurement and knowledge. Central topics\nthat fall under the purview of the epistemology of measurement include\nthe conditions under which measurement produces knowledge; the\ncontent, scope, justification and limits of such knowledge; the\nreasons why particular methodologies of measurement and\nstandardization succeed or fail in supporting particular knowledge\nclaims, and the relationships between measurement and other\nknowledge-producing activities such as observation, theorizing,\nexperimentation, modelling and calculation. In pursuing these\nobjectives, philosophers are drawing on the work of historians and\nsociologists of science, who have been investigating measurement\npractices for a longer period (Wise and Smith 1986; Latour 1987: Ch.\n6; Schaffer 1992; Porter 1995, 2007; Wise 1995; Alder 2002; Galison\n2003; Gooday 2004; Crease 2011), as well as on the history and\nphilosophy of scientific experimentation (Harr\u00e9 1981; Hacking\n1983; Franklin 1986; Cartwright 1999). The following subsections\nsurvey some of the topics discussed in this burgeoning body of\nliterature.\n",
