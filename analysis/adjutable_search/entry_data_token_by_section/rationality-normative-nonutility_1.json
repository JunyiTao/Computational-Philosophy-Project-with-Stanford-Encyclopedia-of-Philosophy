    "main_text": "Expected Utility Theory || Components\n1.2 Components\n1.2.1 Utility\n\nSince representation theorems show that a utility (and probability)\nfunction can be derived from preferences\u2014that having a\nparticular expectational utility function is mathematically equivalent\nto having a particular preference ordering\u2014they open up a number\nof possibilities for understanding the utility function. There are two\nquestions here: what the utility function corresponds to (the\nmetaphysical question), and how we determine an individual\u2019s\nutility function (the epistemic question).\n\nThe first question is whether the utility function corresponds to a\nreal-world quantity, such as strength of desire or perceived\ndesirability or perceived goodness, or whether it is merely a\nconvenient way to represent preferences. The former view is known as\npsychological realism (Buchak 2013) or weak realism\n(Zynda 2000), and is held\nby Allais (1953) and Weirich (2008, 2020), for example. The latter\nview is known as formalism (Hansson 1988),\noperationalism (B\u00e9rmudez 2009), or the\nrepresentational viewpoint (Wakker 1994), and is particularly\nassociated with decision theorists from the mid-twentieth century\n(Luce & Raiffa 1957, Arrow 1951, Harsanyi 1977), and with contemporary economists.\n\nThe second question is what facts are relevant to determining\nsomeone\u2019s utility function. Everyone in the debate accepts that\npreferences provide evidence for the utility function, but there is\ndisagreement about whether there may be other sources of evidence as\nwell. Constructivists hold that an individual\u2019s utility\nfunction is defined by her preferences\u2014utility is\n\u201cconstructed\u201d from preference\u2014so there are can be no\nother relevant facts (discussed in Dreier 1996, Buchak 2013); this\nview is also called strong realism (Zynda 2000). Non-constructive\nrealists, by contrast, hold that there are other sources of\nevidence about the utility function: for example, an individual might\nhave introspective access to her utility function. This latter view\nonly makes sense if one is a psychological realist, though one can\npair constructivism with either psychological realism or\nformalism.\n\nA key fact to note about the utility function is that it is\nreal-valued: each consequence can be assigned a real number.\nThis means that no consequence is of infinite value, and all\nconsequences are comparable. As we will see, each of these\ntwo properties invites a challenge.\n1.2.2 Probability\n\nGiven that a probability function can also be derived from\npreferences, a similar question arises about the nature and\ndetermination of the probability function. One could hold that the\nprobability function represents some real-world quantity, such as\npartial belief; or one could hold that the probability function is\nmerely a way of representing some feature of betting behavior. There\nis also disagreement about what facts are relevant to determining\nsomeone\u2019s probability function: some hold that it is determined\nfrom betting behavior or from the deliverances of a representation\ntheorem while others take it to be primitive (see Eriksson &\nH\u00e1jek 2007).\n\nProbability is real-valued and pointwise\n(\u201csharp\u201d, \u201cprecise\u201d), meaning that there is a\nunique number representing an individual\u2019s belief in or evidence\nfor an event. Again, this property will invite a challenge.\n1.2.3 Expectation\n\nWe can see the norm of expected utility in one of two ways:\nmaximize expected utility, or have preferences that obey the axioms.\nBecause of this, normative arguments for expected utility can argue\neither for the functional form itself or for the normativity of the\naxioms. Examples of the former include the argument that expected\nutility maximizers do better in the long run, though these arguments\nfell out of favor somewhat as the popularity of the realist\ninterpretations of utility waned. Examples of the latter include the\nidea that each axiom is itself an obvious constraint and the idea that\nthe axioms follow from consequentialist (or means-ends rationality)\nprinciples. Of particular note is a proof that non-EU maximizers will\neither be inconsistent or non-consequentialist over time (Hammond\n1988); how alternative theories have fared under dynamic choice has\nbeen a significant focus of arguments about their rationality.\n\nThe idea that EU maximization is the correct norm can be challenged on\nseveral different grounds, as we will see. Those who advocate for\nnon-EU theories respond to the arguments listed above by either\narguing that the new norm doesn\u2019t actually fall prey to the\nargument (e.g., provide a representation theorem with supposedly more\nintuitive axioms) or that it is nonetheless okay if it does.\n2. Infinite and Unbounded Utility\n2.1 The Challenge from Infinite and Unbounded Utility\n\nThe first challenge to EU maximization stems from two ways that\ninfinite utility can arise in decision situations.\n\nFirst, some particular outcome might have infinite utility or\ninfinite disutility. For example, Pascal\u2019s Wager is\nmotivated by the idea that eternal life with God has infinite value,\nso one should \u201cwager for God\u201d as long as one assigns some\nnon-zero probability to God\u2019s existence (Pascal 1670). If a\nparticular outcome has infinite (dis)value, then the Continuity Axiom\nor the Archimedean Axiom will not hold. (See discussions in Hacking\n1972 and H\u00e1jek 2003, and a related issue for utilitarianism in\nVallentyne 1993, Vallentyne & Kagan 1997, and Bostrom 2011.)\n\nSecond, all outcomes might have finite utility value, but this value\nmight be unbounded, which, in combination with allowing that\nthere can be infinitely many states, gives rise to various\nparadoxes. The most famous of these is the St. Petersburg\nParadox, first introduced by Nicolas Bernoulli in a 1713 letter\n(published in J. Bernoulli DW). Imagine a gamble whose\noutcome is determined by flipping a fair coin until it comes up\nheads. If it lands heads for the first time on the\nnth flip, the recipient gets $\\(2^n\\); thus the\ngamble has infinite expected monetary value for the person who takes\nit (it has a \\(\\lfrac{1}{2}\\) probability of yielding $2, a\n\\(\\lfrac{1}{4}\\) probability of yielding $4, a \\(\\lfrac{1}{8}\\)\nprobability of yielding $8, and so forth, and \n\n\\[\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(2) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(4) + \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)(8) + \\ldots \\rightarrow \\infty.\\]\n\n\nWhile this version can be resolved by allowing utility to diminish\nmarginally in money\u2014so that the gamble has finite expected\nutility\u2014if the payoffs are in utility rather than money, then\nthe gamble will have infinite expected utility.\n\nRelated paradoxes and problems abound. One centers around a pair of\ngames, the Pasadena game and the Altadena game\n(Nover & H\u00e1jek 2004). The Pasadena game is also played by\nflipping a fair coin until it lands heads; here, the player receives\n\\(\\$({-1})^{n-1}(2^n/n)\\) if the first heads occurs on the\nnth flip. Thus, its payoffs alternate between\npositive and negative values of increasing size, so that its terms can\nbe rearranged to yield any sum whatsoever, and its expectation does\nnot exist. The Altadena game is identical to the Pasadena game, except\nthat every payoff is raised by a dollar. Again, its terms can be\nrearranged to yield any value, and again its expectation does not\nexist. However, it seems (contra EU maximization) that the Altadena\ngame should be preferred to the Pasadena game, since the former\nstate-wise dominates the latter\u2014it is better in every\npossible state of the world (see also Colyvan 2006, Fine 2008,\nH\u00e1jek & Nover 2008). Similarly, it seems that the\nPetrograd game, which increases each payoff of the St.\nPetersburg game by $1, should be preferred to the St. Petersburg game,\neven though EU maximization will say they have the same (infinite)\nexpectation (Colyvan 2008).\n\n(See also Broome\u2019s (1995) discussion of the two-envelope\nparadox; Arntzenius, Elga, and Hawthorne\u2019s (2004) discussion of\ndiachronic puzzles involving infinite utility; and McGee\u2019s\n(1999) argument that the utility function ought to be bounded, which\nwill dissolve the above paradoxes.)\n2.2 Proposals\n\nSeveral proposals retain the basic EU norm, but reject the idea that\nthe utility function ranges only over the real numbers. Some hold that\nthe utility function can take hyper-real values (Skala 1975,\nSobel 1996). Others hold that the utility function can take\nsurreal values (H\u00e1jek 2003, Chen & Rubio 2020).\nThese proposals allow for versions of the Continuity/Archimedean\nAxiom. Another alternative is to use a vector-valued (i.e.,\nlexicographic) utility function, which rejects these axioms\n(see discussion in H\u00e1jek 2003).\n\nA different kind of response is to subsume EU maximization under a\nmore general norm that also applies when utility is infinite. Bartha\n(2007, 2016) defines relative utility, which is a three-place\nrelation that compares two outcomes or lotteries relative to a third\n\u201cbase point\u201d that is worse than both. The relative utility\nof \\(A\\) to \\(B\\) with base-point \\(Z\\) (written \\((A, B; Z)\\)) will\nbe:\n\n\n\nIf \\(A,\\) \\(B\\) and \\(Z\\) are finitely valued gambles: \n\n\\[\\frac{u(A) - u(Z)}{u(B) - u(Z)},\\]\n\n\nas in standard EU maximization\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) is infinitely valued and \\(B\\) and \\(Z\\) are not:\n\\(\\infty\\)\n\n\nRelative utility ranges over the extended real numbers \\(\\{\\cR \\cup\n\\infty\\}.\\) \u201cFinite\u201d and \u201cinfinite\u201d values can\nbe determined from preferences. Furthermore, relative utility is\nexpectational \n\n\\[U(\\{A, p; A', 1-p\\}, B; Z) = pU(A, B; Z) + (1-p)U(A', B; Z)\\]\n\n\nand has a representation theorem consisting of the standard EU axioms\nminus Continuity. (See Bartha 2007 for application to infinite-utility\nconsequences and Bartha 2016 for application to unbounded-utility\nconsequences.)\n\nWhen considering only the paradoxes of unbounded utility (not those of\ninfinite utility), there are other ways to subsume EU maximization\nunder a more general norm. Colyvan (2008) defines relative\nexpected utility (unrelated to Bartha\u2019s relative utility)\nof act \\(f = \\{E_1, x_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\}\\) over \\(g = \\{E_1,\ny_1;\\ldots; E_n, y_n\\}\\) as: \n\n\\[\\REU(f,g) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} p(E_{i}) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u(y_{i})\\right)\\]\n\n\nIn other words, one takes the difference in utility between \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) in each state, and weights this value by the probability of each\nstate. Colyvan similarly defines the infinite state-space case as\n\n\\[\\REU(f,g) = \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} p(E_{i}) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u(y_{i})\\right).\\]\n\n\nThe new norm is that \\(f \\succcurlyeq g\\) iff \\(\\REU(f, g) \\ge 0.\\)\nThis rule agrees with EU maximization in cases of finite state spaces,\nbut also agrees with state-wise dominance; so it can require that the\nAltadena game is preferred to the Pasadena game and the Petrograd game\nis preferred to the St. Petersburg game. (See also Colyvan & H\u00e1jek 2016.)\n\nA more modest extension of standard EU maximization is suggested by\nEaswaran (2008). He points out that although the Pasadena and Altadena\ngames lack a \u201cstrong\u201d expectation, they do have a\n\u201cweak\u201d expectation. (The difference corresponds to the\ndifference between the strong and weak law of large numbers.). Thus,\nwe can hold that a decision-maker is required to value a gamble at its\nweak expectation, which is equivalent to its strong expectation if the\nlatter exists. (See also Gwiazda 2014, Easwaran 2014b; relatedly, Fine (2008) shows that these two games and the St. Petersberg paradox can be assigned finite values that are consistent with EU theory.).\n\nLauwers and Vallentyne (2016) combine an extension of Easwaran\u2019s\nproposal to infinite weak expectations with an extension of\nColyvan\u2019s proposal to cardinal relative expectation\nthat can be interval-valued. Meacham (2019) extends\nColyvan\u2019s proposal to cover cases in which the acts to be\ncompared have utilities that are to be compared in different states,\nand cases in which probabilities are act-dependent; his difference\nminimizing theory re-orders each gamble from worst consequence to\nbest consequence, before taking their relative expectation. A key\ndifference between these two extensions is that difference minimizing\ntheory adheres to stochastic dominance and a related\nprinciple called stochastic equivalence. (See also discussion\nin Seidenfeld, Schervish, & Kadane 2009; H\u00e1jek 2014;\nColyvan & H\u00e1jek 2016.)\n\nIn a more radical departure from standard EU maximization, Easwaran\n(2014a) develops an axiomatic decision theory based on\nstate-wise dominance, that starts with utility and probability and\nderives a normative preference relation. In cases that fit the\nstandard parameters of EU maximization, this theory can be made to\nagree with EU maximization; but it also allows us to compare some acts\nwith infinite value, and some acts that don\u2019t fit the standard\nparameters (e.g., incommensurable acts, acts with probabilities that\nare comparative but non-numerical).\n\nFinally, one could truncate the norm of EU maximization. Some\nhave argued that that for a gamble involving very small probabilities,\nwe should discount those probabilities down to zero, regardless of the\nutilities involved. When combined with a way of aggregating the\nremaining possibilities, this strategy will yield a finite value for\nthe unbounded-utility paradoxes, and also allow people who attribute a\nvery small probability to God\u2019s existence to avoid wagering for\nGod. (This idea traces back to Nicolaus Bernoulli, Daniel Bernoulli,\nd\u2019Alambert, Buffon, and Borel [see Monton 2019 for a historical\nsurvey]; contemporary proponents of this view include Jordan 1994,\nSmith 2014, Monton 2019.)\n3. Incommensurability\n3.1 The Challenge from Incommensurability\n\nAnother challenge to expected utility maximization is to the idea that\npreferences are totally ordered\u2014to the idea that consequences\ncan be ranked according to a single, consistent utility function. In\neconomics, this idea goes back at least to Aumann (1962); in\nphilosophy, it has been taken up more recently by ethicists.\nEconomists tend to frame the challenge as a challenge to the idea that\nthe preference relation is complete, and ethicists to the\nidea that the betterness relation is complete. I use\n\\(\\succcurlyeq\\) to represent whichever relation is at issue,\nrecognizing that some proposals may be more compelling in one case\nthan the other.\n\nThe key claim is that there are some pairs of options for which it is\nfalse that one is preferred to (or better than) the other, but it is\nalso false that they are equi-preferred (or equally good). Proposed\nexamples include both the mundane and the serious: a Mexican\nrestaurant and a Chinese restaurant; a career in the military and a\ncareer as a priest; and, in an example due to Sartre (1946), whether\nto stay with one\u2019s ailing mother or join the Free French. Taking\nup the second of these examples: it is not the case that a career in\nthe military is preferred to (or better than) a career as a priest,\nnor vice versa; but it is also not the case that they are\nequi-preferred (or equally good). Call the relation that holds between\noptions in these pairs incommensurability.\n\nIncommensurability is most directly a challenge to Completeness, since\non the most natural interpretation of \\(\\succcurlyeq,\\) the fact that\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are incommensurable means that neither \\(A\n\\succcurlyeq B\\) nor \\(B \\succcurlyeq A.\\) But incommensurability can\ninstead be framed as a challenge to Transitivity, if we assume that\nincommensurability is indifference, or define \\(A \\succcurlyeq B\\) as\nthe negation of \\(B \\succ A\\) (thus assuming Completeness by\ndefinition). To see this, notice that if two options \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nare incommensurable, then \u201csweetening\u201d \\(A\\) to a slightly\nbetter \\(A^+\\) will still leave \\(A^+\\) and \\(B\\) incommensurable. For\nexample, if \\(A\\) is a career in the military and \\(A^+\\) is this\ncareer but with a slightly higher salary, the latter is still\nincommensurable with a career as a priest. This pattern suffices to\nshow that the relation \\(\\sim\\) is intransitive, since \\(A \\sim B\\)\nand \\(B \\sim {A^+},\\) but \\({A^+} \\succ A\\) (de Sousa 1974).\n\nThere are four options for understanding incommensurability.\nEpistemicists hold that there is always some fact of the\nmatter about which of the three relations \\((\\succ,\\) \\(\\prec,\\)\n\\(\\sim)\\) holds, but that it is sometimes difficult or impossible to\ndetermine which one\u2014thus incommensurability is merely apparent.\nThey can model the decision problem in the standard way, but as a\nproblem of uncertainty about values: one does not know whether one is\nin a state in which \\(A \\succcurlyeq B,\\) but one assigns some\nprobability to that state, and maximizes expected utility taking these\nkinds of uncertainties into account. Indeterminists hold that\nit is indeterminate which relation holds, because these relations are\nvague; thus incommensurability is a type of vagueness (Griffin 1986,\nBroome 1997, Sugden 2009, Constantinescu 2012).\nIncomparabilists hold that in cases of incommensurability,\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) simply cannot be compared (de Sousa 1974, Raz 1988,\nSinnott-Armstrong 1988). Finally, those who hold that\nincommensurability is parity hold that there is a fourth\nrelation than can obtain between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\n\u201con a par\u201d if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can be compared but it is\nnot the case that one of the three relations holds (Chang 2002a,\n2002b, 2012, 2015, 2016). (Taxonomy from Chang 2002b; see also Chang\n1997.)\n3.2 Proposals: Definitions\n\nAumann (1962) shows that if we have a partial but not total preference\nordering, then we can represent it by a utility function (not\nunique-up-to-positive-affine-transformation) such that \\(A \\succ B\\)\nimplies \\(\\EU(A) \\gt \\EU(B),\\) but not vice versa. Aumann\nshows that there will be at least one utility function that represents\nthe preference ordering according to (objective) EU maximization.\nThus, we can represent a preference ordering as the set of all\nutility functions that \u201cone-way\u201d represent the\ndecision-maker\u2019s preferences. Letting \\(\\EU_u(A)\\) be the\nexpected utility of \\(A\\) given utility function \\(u\\):\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\cU = \\big\\{u \\mid {}&(A \\succ B \\Rightarrow \\EU_u (A) \\succ \\EU_u (B)) \\\\\n    &{}\\amp (A \\sim  B \\Rightarrow \\EU_u (A) = \\EU_u (B))\\big\\}.\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nIf there is no incommensurability, then there will be a single\n(expectational) utility function in \\(\\cU,\\) as in standard EU theory.\nBut when neither \\(A \\succ B\\) nor \\(B \\succ A\\) nor \\(A \\sim B,\\)\nthere will be some \\(u \\in\\cU\\) such that \\(\\EU_u (A) \\gt \\EU_u (B),\\)\nand some \\(u'\\in\\cU\\) such that \\(\\EU_{u'}(B) \\gt \\EU_{u'}(A)\\); and\nvice versa.\n\nChang (2002a,b) proposes a similar strategy, but she takes value facts to\nbe basic, and defines the betterness relation\u2014plus a new\n\u201cparity\u201d relation we will denote\n\u201c\\(\\parallel\\)\u201d\u2014from them, instead of the reverse.\nIn addition, she defines these relations in terms of the\nevaluative differences between \\(A\\) and \\(B,\\) i.e., \\((A -\nB)\\) is the set of all licensed differences in value between \\(A\\) and\n\\(B.\\) If \\((A - B) = \\varnothing,\\) then \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are\nincomparable; however, if \\((A - B) \\ne \\varnothing,\\) the\nrelevant relations are:\n\n\\(A \\succ B\\) iff \\((A - B)\\) contains only positive numbers\n\\(B \\succ A\\) iff \\((A - B)\\) contains only negative numbers\n\\(A \\sim B\\) iff \\((A - B)\\) contains only 0\n \\(A \\parallel B\\) otherwise\n\n\n\\((A - B)\\) might be generated by a set of utility functions, each of\nwhich represents a possible substantive completion of the underlying\nvalue that utility represents (discussed in Chang 2002b);\nalternatively, it might be that there is parity \u201call the way\ndown\u201d (discussed in Chang 2016, where she also replaces the\ndefinition in terms of explicit numerical differences with one in\nterms of bias).\n\nRabinowicz (2008)\nprovides a model that allows for both parity and grades of\nincomparability. On his proposal, the betterness relation is\nrepresented by a class \\(K\\) of \u201cpermissible preference\norderings\u201d, each of which may be complete or incomplete. He\ndefines: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\nx \\succ y & \\text{ iff }  (\\forall R\\in K)(x \\succ_R y)\\\\\nx \\sim  y & \\text{ iff } (\\forall R\\in K)(x \\sim _R  y)\\\\\nx \\parallel y & \\text{  iff } (\\exists R\\in K)(x \\succ_R y) \\amp (\\exists R \\in K)(x  \\succ_R x)\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\n(He defines \\(\\succcurlyeq\\) as the union of several\n\u201catomic\u201d possibilities for \\(K.\\)) Letting \\(x\\relT y\\)\nhold iff \\(x \\succ y\\) or \\(y \\succ x\\) or \\(x \\sim y,\\) he then\ndefines:\n\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are fully comparable iff \\((\\forall R \\in K)(xT_R\ny)\\)\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are fully on a par iff they are fully comparable\nand \\(x\\parallel y\\)\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are incomparable iff \\((\\forall R\\in\nK)(\\text{not-}(xT _Ry))\\)\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are weakly incomparable iff \\((\\exists R\\in\nK)(\\text{not-}(xT_Ry)\\)\n\n\nClass \\(K\\) won\u2019t necessarily give rise to a utility\nfunction.\n3.3 Proposals: Decision Rules\n\nIf the decision-maker\u2019s preferences are represented by a set of\nutility functions \\(\\cU,\\) then a number of possible decision rules\nsuggest themselves. All the proposed rules focus on selection of\npermissible options from a set of alternatives \\(\\cS,\\)\nrather than an aggregation function or a complete ranking of options\n(we can always recover the former from the latter, but not vice\nversa). To understand the first three of these rules, we can\nimaginatively think of each possible utility function as a\n\u201ccommittee member\u201d, and posit a rule for choice based on\nfacts about the opinions of the committee.\n\nFirst, we might choose any option which some committee member\nendorses; that is, we might choose any option which maximizes expected\nutility relative to some utility function: \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{ A \\mid (\\exists u \\in \\cU) (\\forall B \\in \\cS)(\\EU_u (A) \\ge \\EU_u (B))\\}\\]\n\n\nLevi (1974) terms this rule E-admissibility, and Hare (2010)\ncalls it prospectism. (See\n section 4.3.3\n for Levi\u2019s full proposal, and for extensions of this rule to\nthe case in which the decision-maker does not have a single\nprobability function.)\n\nAumann suggests that we can choose any maximal option: any\noption that isn\u2019t worse, according to all committee members,\nthan some other particular option; that is, an option to which no\nother option is (strictly) preferred (assigned a higher utility by all\nutility functions): \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid  (\\forall B \\in  \\cS ) (\\exists u \\in \\cU)(\\EU_u (A)  \\ge  \\EU_u (B)) \\}\\]\n\n\nThis is a more permissive rule than E-admissibility: every\nE-admissible option will be maximal, but not vice versa. To\nsee the difference between the two rules, notice that if the\ndecision-maker has two possible rankings, \\(A \\gt B \\gt C\\) and \\(C\n\\gt B \\gt A,\\) then all three options will be maximal but only \\(A\\)\nand \\(C\\) will be E-admissible (no particular option is definitively\npreferred to \\(B,\\) so \\(B\\) is maximal; but it is definitive that\nsomething is preferred to \\(B,\\) so \\(B\\) is not E-admissible).\n\nA final possibility is that we can choose any option that is not\ninterval dominated by another act (Schick 1979, Gert 2004),\nwhere an interval dominated option has a lower \u201cbest\u201d\nvalue than some other option\u2019s \u201cworst\u201d value:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set }  = \\{ A \\mid  (\\forall B \\in  \\cS )(\\text{max}_u  \\EU_u (A)  \\ge  \\text{min}_u  \\EU_u (B))\\}  \\]\n\n\nThis is a more permissive rule than both E-admissibility and\nmaximality.\n\nA different type of rule first looks at the options\u2019 possible\nutility values in each state, before aggregating over states; this is\nwhat Hare\u2019s (2010) deferentialism requires. To find out\nif an option O is permissible under deferentialism, we consider how it\nfares if we, in each state, make the assumptions most favorable to it.\nFirst, \u201cregiment\u201d the utility functions in \\(\\cU\\) so that\nthere\u2019s some pair of consequences \\(\\{x, y\\}\\) such that\n\\((\\forall u \\in\\cU)(u(x) = 1 \\amp u(y) = 0)\\); this allows only one\nrepresentative utility function for each possible completion of the\ndecision-maker\u2019s preference. Next, take all the possible\n\u201cstate-segments\u201d\u2014the possible utility assignments in\neach state\u2014and cross them together in every possible arrangement\nto get an \u201cexpanded\u201d set of utility functions (for\nexample, this will contain every possible utility function in \\(E\\)\ncoupled with every possible utility function not-\\(E\\)). Then \\(A\\) is\npermissible iff \\(A\\) maximizes expected utility relative to\nsome utility function in this expanded set.\n4. Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity\n4.1 The Challenge from Imprecise Probabilities or Ambiguity\n\nA third challenge to expected utility maximization holds that\nsubjective probabilities need not be \u201csharp\u201d or\n\u201cprecise\u201d, i.e., need not be a single, point-wise\nfunction. (In economics, this phenomenon is typically called\nambiguity.) There are three historically significant\nmotivations for imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe first is that decision makers treat subjective (or unknown)\nprobabilities differently from objective probabilities in their\ndecision-making behavior. The classic example of this is the Ellsberg\nParadox (Ellsberg 1961, 2001). Imagine you face an urn filled with 90\nballs that are red, black, and yellow, from which a single ball will\nbe drawn. You know that 30 of the balls are red, but you know nothing\nabout the proportion of black and yellow balls. Do you prefer \\(f_1\\)\nor \\(f_2\\); and do you prefer \\(f_3\\) or \\(f_4\\)?\n\n\\(f_1\\): $100 if the ball is red; $0 if the ball is black or\nyellow.\n\\(f_2\\): $100 if the ball is black; $0 if the ball is red or\nyellow.\n\\(f_3\\): $100 if the ball is red or yellow; $0 if the ball is\nblack.\n\\(f_4\\): $100 if the ball is black or yellow; $0 if the ball is\nred.\n\n\nMost people appear to (strictly) prefer \\(f_1\\) to \\(f_2\\) and\n(strictly) prefer \\(f_4\\) to \\(f_3.\\) They would rather bet on the\nknown or objective probability than the unknown or subjective\none\u2014in the first pair, red has an\nobjective probability of \\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\), whereas black\nhas a possible objective probability ranging\nfrom 0 to \\(\\lfrac{2}{3}\\); in the second pair, black\nor yellow has an objective probability of \\(\\lfrac{2}{3}\\)\nwhereas red or yellow has a possible objective\nprobability ranging from \\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\) to 1. These preferences\nviolate the Sure-thing Principle. (To see this, notice that the only\ndifference between the two pairs of acts is that the first pair yields\n$0 on yellow and the second pair yields $100\non yellow.)\n\nThe second motivation for imprecise probability is that even if all\nthe relevant probabilities are subjective, a decision-maker\u2019s\nbetting behavior might depend on how reliable or well-supported by\nevidence those probabilities are. Consider a decision-maker who may\nbet on three different tennis matches: in the first, she knows a lot\nabout the players and knows they are very evenly matched; in the\nsecond, she knows nothing whatsoever about either player; and in the\nthird, she knows that one of the two players is much better than the\nother, but she does not know which one. In each of the matches, the\ndecision-maker should presumably assign equal probability to each\nplayer winning, since her information in favor of each is symmetrical;\nnonetheless, it seems rational to bet only on the first match and not\non the other two (G\u00e4rdenfors & Sahlin 1982; see also Ellsberg\n1961).\n\nA final motivation for imprecise probability is that evidence\ndoesn\u2019t always determine precise probabilities (Levi 1974, 1983;\nWalley 1991; Joyce 2005;\nSturgeon 2008; White\n2009; Elga 2010). Assume a stranger approaches you and pulls three\nitems out of a bag: a regular-sized tube of toothpaste, a live\njellyfish, and a travel-sized tube of toothpaste; you are asked to\nassign probability to the proposition that the next item he pulls out\nwill be another tube of toothpaste\u2014but it seems that you lack\nenough evidence to do so (Elga 2010).\n4.2 Proposals: Probability Representations\n\nTo accommodate imprecise probabilities in decision-making, we need\nboth an alternative way to represent probabilities and an alternative\ndecision rule that operates on the newly-represented probabilities.\nThere are two primary ways to represent imprecise probabilities.\n\nThe first is to assign an interval, instead of a single\nnumber, to each proposition. For example, in the Ellsberg case: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\np(\\RED) & = [\\lfrac{1}{3}], \\\\\np(\\YELLOW) & = [0, \\lfrac{2}{3}]; \\\\\np(\\BLACK) & = [0, \\lfrac{2}{3}].\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThe second is to represent the individual\u2019s beliefs as a\nset of probability functions. For example, in the Ellsberg\ncase:\n\n\\[ \n\\cQ = \\{p\\in\\cP \\mid p(\\RED) = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\} \n\\]\n\n\nThis means,\nfor example, that the probability distribution \\(p(\\rR, \\rB, \\rY) =\n\\langle \\lfrac{1}{3}, 0, \\lfrac{2}{3}\\rangle\\) and the probability\ndistribution \\(\\langle \\lfrac{1}{3}, \\lfrac{1}{3},\n\\lfrac{1}{3}\\rangle\\) are both compatible with the available evidence\nor possible \u201ccompletion\u201d of the individual\u2019s\nbeliefs.\n\nEach set-probability representation gives rise to an interval representation (assuming the set of\nprobability functions is convex); but the set-probability\nrepresentation provides more structure to the relationships between\npropositions. (A different proposal retains a precise probability\nfunction but refines the objects over which utility and probability\nrange (Bradley 2015; Stef\u00e1nsson & Bradley 2015, 2019); see\ndiscussion in\n section 5.2.)\n4.3 Proposals: Decision Rules\n\nWe will examine rules for decision-making with imprecise probabilities\nin terms of how they evaluate the Ellsberg choices; for ease of\nexposition we will assume \\(u(\\$0) = 0\\) and \\(u(\\$100) = 1.\\) All\nproposals here are equivalent to EU maximization when there is a\nsingle probability distribution in the set, so all will assign utility\n\\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\) to \\(f_1\\) and \\(\\lfrac{2}{3}\\) to \\(f_4\\) in the\nEllsberg gamble; they differ in how they value the other acts.\n4.3.1 Aggregative Decision Rules using Sets of Probabilities\n\nThe first type of decision rule associates to each act a single value,\nand yields a complete ranking of acts; call these aggregative\nrules. The rules in this section use sets of probabilities.\n\nBefore we discuss these rules, it will be helpful to keep in mind\nthree aggregative rules that operate under complete ignorance, i.e.,\nwhen we have no information whatsoever about the state of the world.\nThe first is maximin, which says to pick the option with the highest\nminimum utility. The second is maximax, which says to pick the option\nwith the highest maximum utility. The third, known as the Hurwicz\ncriterion, says to take a weighted average, for each option, of the\nminimum and maximum utility, where the weight \\(\\alpha \\in [0, 1]\\)\nrepresents a decision-maker\u2019s level of optimism/pessimism\n(Hurwicz 1951a): \n\n\\[\nH(f) = (1 - \\alpha)(\\text{min}_u(f)) + \\alpha(\\text{max}_u(f))\\]\n\n\nUsing the set-probability representation, we can associate to each\nprobability distribution an expected utility value, to yield a set of\nexpected utility values. Let \\(\\EU_p(f)\\) be the expected utility of\n\\(f\\) given probability distribution \\(p.\\)\n\nOne proposal is that the value of an act is its minimum expected\nutility value; thus, a decision-maker should maximize her minimum\nexpected utility (Wald 1950; Hurwicz 1951b; Good 1952; Gilboa\n& Schmeidler 1989): \n\n\\[\\text{\u0393-maximin}(f) = \\text{min}_p (\\EU_p(f))\\]\n\n\nThis rule is also sometimes known as MMEU. For the Ellsberg choices,\nthe minimum expected utilities are, for \\(f_1\\), \\(f_2\\), \\(f_3\\), and \\(f_4\\), respectively: \\(\\lfrac{1}{3},\\) \\(0,\\) \\(\\lfrac{1}{3},\\) and \\(\\lfrac{2}{3},\\). These values rationalize the common preference for \\(f_1 \\gt f_2\\) and \\(f_4 \\gt\nf_3.\\) Conversely, an individual who maximizes her maximum\nexpected utility\u2014who uses \u0393-maximax\u2014would have\nthe reverse preferences.\n\n\u0393-maximin appears too pessimistic. We might instead use an\nEU-analogue of Hurwicz criterion: take a weighted average of the\nminimum expected utility and the maximum expected utility, with\nweight \\(\\alpha \\in[0, 1]\\) corresponding to a decision-maker\u2019s\nlevel of pessimism (Hurwicz 1951b; Shackle 1952; Luce & Raiffa\n1957; Ellsberg 2001; Ghirardato et al. 2003): \n\n\\[\\alpha\\text{-maximin}(f) = (1 - \\alpha)(\\text{min}_p (\\EU_p (f))) + \\alpha(\\text{max}_p (\\EU_p(f)))\\]\n\n\nIn the Ellsberg choice, this model will assign\n\\(\\alpha(\\lfrac{2}{3})\\) to \\(f_2\\) and \\((1 - \\alpha)(\\lfrac{1}{3}) +\n\\alpha(1)\\) to \\(f_3,\\) making these acts disprefered to \\(f_1\\) and\n\\(f_4,\\) respectively, if \\(\\alpha \\lt \\lfrac{1}{2}\\); preferred to\n\\(f_1\\) and \\(f_4\\) if \\(\\alpha \\gt \\lfrac{1}{2}\\); and indifferent to\n\\(f_1\\) and \\(f_4\\) if \\(\\alpha = \\lfrac{1}{2}.\\)\n\nInstead, we can assume the decision-maker considers two quantities\nwhen evaluating an act: the EU of the act, according to her\n\u201cbest estimate\u201d at the probabilities (\\(\\text{est}_p),\\)\nand the minimum EU of the act as the probability ranges over \\(\\cQ\\);\nshe also assigns a degree of confidence \\(\\varrho \\in[0, 1]\\) to her\nestimated probability distribution. The value of an act will then be a\nweighted average of her best estimate EU and the minimum EU, with her\nbest estimate weighed by her degree of confidence (Hodges &\nLehmann 1952; Ellsberg 1961): \n\n\\[E(f) = \\varrho(\\text{est}_p (\\EU_p(f))) + (1 - \\varrho)(\\text{min}_p (\\EU_p(f)))\\]\n\n\nIn the Ellsberg pairs, assuming the \u201cbest estimate\u201d is\nthat yellow and black\neach have probability \\(\\lfrac{1}{3}\\), this will assign\n\\(\\varrho(\\lfrac{1}{3})\\) to \\(f_2\\) and \\(\\varrho(\\lfrac{2}{3}) + (1\n- \\varrho)(\\lfrac{1}{3})\\) to \\(f_3,\\) making these acts disprefered\nto \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_4,\\) respectively, as long as \\(\\varrho \\lt\n1.\\)\n\nWe can also combine these two proposals (Ellsberg 2001): \n\n\\[\nE(f) = \\varrho(\\text{est}_p \\EU_p(f)) + (1 - \\varrho)\n[(1 - \\alpha)(\\text{min}_p \\EU_p(f)) + \\alpha(\\text{max}_p \\EU_p(f))]\\]\n\n\nThis model will rationalize the common preferences for many choices of\n\\(\\varrho\\) and \\(\\alpha\\) (setting \\(\\varrho = 0\\) or \\(\\alpha = 0\\)\nyields previously-mentioned models).\n\nWe might add additional structure to the representation: to each\nprobability function, the decision-maker assigns a degree of\n\u201creliability\u201d, which tracks how much relevant information\nthe decision-maker has about the states of nature (Good 1952;\nG\u00e4rdenfors & Sahlin 1982). A decision-maker selects a desired\nthreshold level of epistemic reliability. She then considers all\nprobability functions above this threshold, and maximizes the minimum\nexpected utility (\u0393-maximin) with respect to these probability\nfunctions. (In principle, a different decision rule could be used in\nthis step.) For the decision-maker deciding whether to bet on tennis\nmatches, the above-threshold probability functions for the first match\nmay include only \\(p(P1 \\text{WINS}) \\approx 0.5,\\) but for the second\nand third match may also include \\(p(P1 \\text{WINS}) \\approx 0\\); thus\nbetting on P1 in the first match will have a higher value than betting\non P1 in the other matches.\n4.3.2 Aggregative Decision Rules: Choquet Expected Utility\n\nA different kind of rule is Choquet expected utility, also\nknown as cumulative utility (Schmeidler 1989; Gilboa 1987).\nThis rule starts with a function \\(v\\) which, like a probability\nfunction, obeys \\(v(E)\\in[0, 1],\\) \\(v(0) = 0,\\) \\(v(1) = 1,\\) and \\(A\n\\subseteq B\\) implies \\(v(A) \\le v(A).\\) Unlike a probability\nfunction, however, \\(v\\) is non-additive; and \\(v\\) is not\nstraightforwardly used to calculate an expectation. (Many economists\nrefer to this function as a \u201cnon-additive subjective probability\nfunction\u201d.). Choquet expected utility is a member of the\nrank-dependent family (Quiggin 1982, Yaari 1987, Kahneman\n& Tversky 1979, Tversky & Kahneman 1992, Wakker 2010).\nFunctions in this family let the weight of an event in an act\u2019s\noverall value depend on both the probability-like element and the\nevent\u2019s position in the ordering of an act, e.g., whether it is\nthe worst or best event for that act. Formally, let \\(g' = \\{E_1,\nx_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\}\\) be a re-ordering of act \\(g\\) from worst\nevent to best event, so that \\(u(x_1) \\le \\ldots \\le u(x_n).\\) The\nChoquet expected utility of \\(g'\\) (and therefore of \\(g\\))\nis: \n\n\\[\n\\CEU(g') = u(x_{1}) + \\sum_{i = 2}^{n} v\\left(\\bigcup_{j = i}^{n} E_{j}\\right) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u(x_{i - 1})\\right)\\]\n\n\nIf \\(v\\) is additive, then \\(v\\) is an (additive) probability function\nand CEU reduces to EU. If \\(v\\) is convex \\((v(E) + v(F) \\le v(EF) +\nv(E v F)),\\) then the individual is uncertainty-averse.\n\nIn the Ellsberg example, we are given \\(p(\\RED) = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\) and\n\\(p(\\BLACK \\lor \\YELLOW) = \\lfrac{2}{3},\\) and so we can assume\n\\(v(\\RED) = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\) and \\(v(\\BLACK \\lor \\YELLOW) =\n\\lfrac{2}{3}.\\) A person who is \u201cambiguity averse\u201d will\nassign \\(v(\\BLACK) + v(\\YELLOW) \\le v(\\BLACK \\lor \\YELLOW)\\); let us\nassume \\(v(\\BLACK) = v(\\YELLOW) = \\lfrac{1}{9}.\\) Similarly, she will\nassign \\(v(\\RED \\lor \\YELLOW) + v(\\BLACK) \\le 1\\); let us assume\n\\(v(\\RED \\lor \\YELLOW) = \\lfrac{4}{9}.\\)\n\nThen the values of the acts will be: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\CEU(f_1) & = 0 + v(\\RED)(1 - 0) & = \\lfrac{1}{3}\\\\\n\\CEU(f_2) & = 0 + v(\\BLACK)(1 - 0) & = \\lfrac{1}{9}\\\\\n\\CEU(f_3) & = 0 + v(\\RED \\lor  \\YELLOW)(1 - 0) &= \\lfrac{4}{9}\\\\\n\\CEU(f_4) & = 0 + v(\\BLACK \\lor  \\YELLOW)(1 - 0) &= \\lfrac{2}{3}\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nThis assignment recovers the Ellsberg preferences.\n\nAxiomatizations of CEU use a restricted version of the separability\ncondition (the \u201cComonotonic\u201d Sure-thing Principle or\n\u201cComonotonic\u201d Tradeoff Consistency): namely, the condition\nonly holds when all of the acts in its domain are\ncomonotonic, i.e., when the worst-to-best ranking of the\nevents coincides for all the acts (Gilboa 1987, Schmeidler 1989,\nWakker 1989, Chew & Wakker 1996, K\u00f6bberling & Wakker\n2003; see also Wakker 2010, who also notes the relationship between\nCEU and \\(\\alpha\\)-maximin.)\n4.3.3 Decision Rules that Select from a Menu\n\nAnother different type of proposal focuses on selection of\npermissible options from a set of alternatives \\(\\cS,\\)\nrather than a complete ranking of options. As in\n section 3.3,\n we can imaginatively think of each possible probability distribution\nin a set \\(\\cQ\\) as a \u201ccommittee member\u201d, and posit a rule\nfor choice based on facts about the opinions of the committee. (The\nfirst three rules are versions of the rules for sets of utility\nfunctions in 3.3, and can be combined to cover sets of\nprobability/utility pairs.)\n\nThe first possibility is that a decision-maker is permitted to pick an\nact just in case some committee member is permitted to pick\nit over all the alternatives: just in case it maximizes expected\nutility relative to some probability function in the set.\nThis is known as E-admissibility (Levi 1974, 1983, 1986;\nSeidenfeld, Schervish, & Kadane 2010): \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid (\\exists p\\in\\cQ )(\\forall B \\in \\cS)(\\EU_p(A) \\ge \\EU_p(B))\\}\\]\n\n\nLevi in fact tells a more complicated story about what a\ndecision-maker is permitted to choose, in terms of a procedure that\nrules out successively more and more options. First, the procedure\nselects from all the options just the ones that are E-admissible.\nNext, the procedure selects from the E-admissible options just the\nones that are P-admissible: options that \u201cdo\nbest\u201d at preserving the E-admissible options (the idea being\nthat a rational agent should keep her options open). Finally, the\nprocedure selects from the P-admissible options just the ones that are\nS-admissible: options that maximize the minimum utility.\n(Note that this last step involves maximin, not \u0393-maximin.)\n\nA more permissive rule than E-admissibility permits a choice as long\nthere is no particular alternative that the committee members\nunanimously (strictly) prefer. As in the case of\nutility-sets, this rule is known as maximality (Walley\n1991): \n\n\\[\n\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid (\\forall B\\in\\cS)(\\exists p \\in\\cQ )(\\EU_p(A) \\ge \\EU_p (B))\\}\\]\n\n\n(See\n section 3.3\n for an example of the difference between E-admissibility and\nmaximality.)\n\nMore permissive still is the rule that a choice is permissible as long\nas it is not interval dominated (Schick 1979, Kyburg 1983):\nits maximum value isn\u2019t lower than the minimum value of some\nother act. \n\n\\[\\text{Permissible choice set } = \\{A \\mid (\\forall B\\in \\cS)(\\text{max}_p \\EU_p(A) \\ge \\text{min}_p \\EU_p(B))\\}\\]\n\n\nFor a proof showing that \u0393-maximax implies E-admissibility;\n\u0393-maximin implies maximality; E-admissibility implies\nmaximality; and maximality implies interval dominance, see Troffaes\n(2007).\n\nA final approach is to interpret ambiguity as indeterminacy: one\ncommittee member has the \u201ctrue\u201d probability function, but\nit is indeterminate which one. If all probability functions agree that\nan option is permissible to choose, then it is determinately\npermissible to choose; if all agree that it is impermissible to\nchoose, it is determinately impermissible to choose; and if some hold\nthat it is permissible and others hold that it is impermissible, it is\nindeterminate whether it is permissible (Rinard 2015).\n\nThese rules in this section allow but do not obviously\nexplain the Ellsberg choices unless supplemented by an\nadditional rule (e.g., Levi\u2019s more complicated story or one of\nthe rules from\n section 4.3.1),\n since any choice between \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_2\\) and between \\(f_3\\) and\n\\(f_4\\) appears to be E-admissible, maximal, and\nnon-interval-dominated.\n4.4 Normative Questions\n\nFor those who favor non-sharp probabilities, two sets of normative\nquestions arise. The first set is epistemic: whether it is epistemically rational not\nto have sharp probabilities (White 2009; Elga 2010; Joyce 2011;\nH\u00e1jek & Smithson 2012; Seidenfeld et al. 2012; Mayo-Wilson\n& Wheeler 2016; Schoenfield 2017; Vallinder 2018; Builes et al 2022; Konek\nms. \u2013 see Other Internet Resources).\n\nThe second set of questions question is practical. Some hold that ambiguity aversion is not well-motivated by practical reasons and so we have no reason to account for it (Schoenfield 2020). Others hold that some particular decision rule associated with non-sharp probabilities leads to bad consequences, e.g., in virtue of running afoul of the principles mentioned in\n section 1.2.3. Of particular interest is how\nthese decision rules can be extended to sequential choice (Seidenfeld\n1988a,b; Seidenfeld et al. 1990;\nElga 2010; Bradley and Steele 2014; Chandler 2014; Moss 2015; Sud 2014; Rinard 2015).\n5. Risk Aversion\n5.1 The Challenge from Risk Aversion\n\nA final challenge to expected utility maximization is to the norm\nitself\u2014to the idea that a gamble should be valued at its\nexpectation. In particular, some claim that it is rationally\npermissible for individuals to be risk-averse (or risk-seeking) in a\nsense that conflicts with EU maximization.\n\nSay that an individual is risk-averse in money (or any\nnumerical good) if she prefers the consequences of a gamble to be less\n\u201cspread out\u201d; this concept is made precise by Rothschild\nand Stiglitz\u2019s idea of dispreferring mean-preserving\nspreads (1972). As a special case of this, a person who is\nrisk-averse in money will prefer \\(\\$x\\) to any gamble whose mean\nmonetary value is \\(\\$x.\\) If an EU maximizer is risk-averse in money,\nthen her utility function will be concave (it diminishes marginally,\ni.e., each additional dollar adds less utility than the previous\ndollar); if an EU maximizer is risk-seeking in money, then her utility\nfunction will be convex (Rothschild & Stiglitz 1972). Therefore,\nEU theory equates risk-aversion with having a diminishing marginal\nutility function.\n\nHowever, there are intuitively at least two different reasons that\nsomeone might have for being risk-averse. Consider a person who loves\ncoffee but cannot tolerate more than one cup. Consider another person\nwhose tolerance is very high, such that the first several cups are\neach as pleasurable as the last, but who has a particular attitude\ntowards risk: it would take a very valuable upside in order for her to\ngive up a guaranteed minimum number of cups. Both will prefer 1 cup of\ncoffee to a coin-flip between 0 and 2, but intuitively they value cups\nof coffee very differently, and have very different reasons for their\npreference. This example generalizes: we might consider a person who\nis easily saturated with respect to money (once she has a bit of\nmoney, each additional bit matters less and less to her); and another\nperson who is a miser\u2014he likes each dollar just as much as the\nlast\u2014but nonetheless has the same attitude towards gambling as\nour coffee drinker. Both will disprefer mean-preserving spreads, but\nintuitively have different attitudes towards money and different\nreasons for this preference. Call the attitude of the second person in\neach pair global sensitivity (Allais 1953, Watkins 1977,\nYaari 1987, Hansson 1988, Buchak 2013).\n\nThis kind of example gives rise to several problems. First, if EU\nmaximization is supposed to explain why someone made a\nparticular choice, it ought to be able to distinguish these two\nreasons for preference; but if global sensitivity can be captured at\nall, it will have to be captured by a diminishing marginal utility\nfunction, identical to that of the first person in each pair. Second,\nif one adopts a view of the utility function according to which the\ndecision-maker has introspective access to it, a decision-maker might\nreport that she has preferences like the tolerant coffee drinker or\nthe miser\u2014her utility function is linear\u2014but nonetheless\nif she maximizes EU her utility function will have to be concave; so\nEU maximization will get her utility function wrong. Finally, even if\none holds that a decision-maker does not have introspective access to\nher utility function, if a decision-maker displays global sensitivity,\nthen she will have some preferences that cannot be captured by an\nexpectational utility function (Allais 1953, Hansson 1988, Buchak\n2013).\n\nA related worry displays a troubling implication of EU\nmaximization\u2019s equating risk-aversion with diminishing marginal\nutility. Rabin\u2019s (2000) Calibration Theorem shows that\nif an EU-maximizer is mildly risk-averse in modest-stakes gambles, she\nwill have to be absurdly risk-averse in high-stakes gambles. For\nexample, if an individual would reject the gamble {\u2212$100, 0.5;\n$110, 0.5} at any wealth level, then she must also reject the gamble\n{\u2212$1000, 0.5; $n, 0.5} for any \\(n\\) whatsoever.\n\nFinally, the Allais Paradox identifies a set of preferences\nthat are intuitive but cannot be captured by any expectational utility\nfunction (Allais 1953). Consider the choice between the following two\nlotteries:\n\n\\(L_1 : \\{\\$5,000,000, 0.1; $0, 0.9\\}\\)\n\\(L_2 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.11; \\$0, 0.89\\}\\)\n\n\nSeparately, consider the choice between the following two\nlotteries:\n\n\\(L_3 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.89; \\$5,000,000, 0.1; \\$0, 0.01\\}\\)\n\\(L_4 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 1\\}\\)\n\n\nMost people (strictly) prefer \\(L_1\\) to \\(L_2,\\) and (strictly)\nprefer \\(L_4\\) to \\(L_3,\\) but there are no values \\(u(\\$0),\\)\n\\(u(\\$1\\rM),\\) and \\(u(\\$5\\rM)\\) such that \\(\\EU(L_1) \\gt \\EU(L_2)\\)\nand \\(\\EU(L_4) \\gt \\EU(L_3).\\) The Allais preferences violate the\nIndependence Axiom; when the lotteries are suitably reframed as acts\n(e.g., defined over events such as the drawing of a 100-ticket\nlottery), they violate the Sure-thing Principle or related\nseparability principles.\n5.2 Proposals\n\nThere have been a number of descriptive attempts to explain global\nsensitivity, by those who are either uninterested in normative\nquestions or assume that EU is the correct normative theory. The most\nwell-known of these are prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky 1979;\nTversky & Kahneman 1992) and generalized utility theory (Machina\n1982, 1983, 1987); others are mentioned in the discussion below. See\nStarmer (2000) for an overview.\n\nSome normative proposals seek to accommodate global sensitivity\nwithin expected utility theory, by making the inputs of the\nutility function more fine-grained. Proponents of this\n\u201crefinement strategy\u201d hold that decision-makers prefer\n\\(L_4\\) to \\(L_3\\) because the $0 outcome in \\(L_3\\) would induce\nregret that one forewent a sure $1M (alternatively, because \\(L_4\\)\nincludes psychological certainty) and therefore that the\nconsequence-descriptions should include these facts. Thus, the correct\ndescription of \\(L_3\\) is: \n\n\\[L_3 : \\{\\$1,000,000, 0.89; \\$5,000,000, 0.1; \\$0 \\textit{ and regret, } 0.01\\}\\]\n\n\nOnce these gambles are correctly described, there is no direct\nconflict with EU maximization (Raiffa 1986, Weirich 1986, Schick 1991,\nBroome 1991, Berm\u00fadez 2009, Pettigrew 2015, Buchak 2015). The\nproblem of when two outcomes that appear the same should be\ndistinguished is taken up by Broome (1991), Pettit (1991), and Dreier\n(1996).\n\nThe thought that the value of a consequence depends on what might have\nbeen is systematized by Bradley and Stef\u00e1nsson (2017). Their\nproposal uses a version of expected utility theory developed by\nJeffrey (1965) and axiomatized by Bolker (1966). Jeffrey replaces the\nutility function by a more general \u201cdesirability\u201d function\nDes, which applies not just to consequences but also to prospects;\nindeed, it doesn\u2019t distinguish between \u201cultimate\u201d\nconsequences and prospects, since its inputs are propositions. Bradley\nand Stef\u00e1nsson propose to widen the domain of Des to include\ncounterfactual propositions, thus allowing that preferences for\npropositions can depend on counterfacts. For example, a decision-maker\ncan prefer \u201cI choose the risky options and get nothing, and I\nwouldn\u201dt have been guaranteed anything if I had chosen\ndifferently\u2019 to \u201cI choose the risky option and get\nnothing, and I would have been guaranteed something if I had chosen\ndifferently\u201d, which will rationalize the Allais preferences.\n(Incidentally, their proposal can also rationalize preferences that\nseemingly violate EU because of fairness considerations, as in an\nexample from Diamond (1967).)\n\nIn a different series of articles (Stef\u00e1nsson & Bradley\n2015, 2019), these authors again employ Jeffrey\u2019s framework, but\nthis time widen the domain of Des to include chance\npropositions (in addition to factual prospects), propositions\nlike \u201cthe chance that I get $100 is 0.5\u201d. They hold that a\nrational decision-maker can have a preference between various chances\nof \\(X,\\) even on the supposition that \\(X\\) obtains (she need not\nobey \u201cChance Neutrality\u201d). They capture the idea of\ndisliking risk as such by holding that even though a rational agent\nmust maximize expected desirability, she need not have a \\(\\Des\\)\nfunction of \\(X\\) that is expectational with respect to the Des\nfunction of chance propositions about \\(X\\) (she need not obey\n\u201cLinearity\u201d). For example, \\(\\Des(\\text{\u201cI get\n\\$100\u201d})\\) need not be equal to \\(2(\\Des(\\text{\u201cthe chance\nthat I get \\$100 is 0.5\u201d})).\\) (This does not conflict with\nmaximizing expected desirability, because it concerns only the\nrelationship between particular inputs to the \\(\\Des\\) function, and\ndoes not concern the decision-maker\u2019s subjective\nprobabilities.). This proposal can also rationalize the Ellsberg\npreferences\n (section 4.1),\n because it allows the decision-maker to assign different\nprobabilities to the various chance propositions (see also Bradley\n2015).\n\nOther proposals hold that we should reject the aggregation norm of\nexpected utility. The earliest of these came from Allais himself, who\nheld that decision-makers care not just about the mean utility of a\ngamble, but also about the dispersion of values. He proposes that\nindividuals maximize expected utility plus a measure of the riskiness\nof a gamble, which consists in a multiple of the standard deviation of\nthe gamble and a multiple of its skewness. Formally, if \\(s\\) stands\nfor the standard deviation of \\(L\\) and \\(m\\) stands for the skewness\nof \\(L,\\) then the utility value of \\(L\\) will be (Allais 1953, Hagen\n1979): \n\n\\[\\text{AH}(L) = \\EU(L) + F(s, m/s^2) + \\varepsilon\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(\\varepsilon\\) is an error term. He thus proposes that\nriskiness is an independently valuable property of a gamble, to be\ncombined with (and traded off against) its expected utility. This\nproposal essentially treats the riskiness of a gamble as a property\nthat is (dis)valuable in itself (see also Nozick 1993 on symbolic\nutility).\n\nA final approach treats global sensitivity as a feature of the\ndecision-maker\u2019s way of aggregating utility values. It might be\nthat a decision-maker\u2019s utility and probability function are not\nyet enough to tell us what he should prefer; he must also decide how\nmuch weight to give to what happens in worse states versus what\nhappens in better states. In risk-weighted expected utility\n(Buchak 2013), a generalization of Quiggin\u2019s (1982)\nanticipated utility and a member of the rank-dependent family\n(see\n section 4.3.2),\n this decision is represented by his risk function.\n\nFormally, let \\(g' = \\{E_1, x_1;\\ldots; E_n, x_n\\}\\) be a re-ordering\nof act \\(g\\) from worst event to best event, so that \\(u(x_1) \\le\n\\ldots \\le u(x_n).\\) Then the risk-weighted expected utility\nof \\(g\\) is: \n\n\\[\n\\REU (g') = u(x_{1}) + \\sum_{i = 2}^{n} r\n\\left(\\sum_{j = i}^{n} p(E_{j})\\right) \\left(u(x_{i}) - u( x_{i - 1})\\right)\\]\n\n\nwith \\(0 \\le r(p) \\le 1,\\) \\(r(0) = 0\\) and \\(r(1) = 1,\\) and \\(r(p)\\)\nnon-decreasing.\n\nThe risk function measures the weight of the top \\(p\\)-portion of\nconsequences in the evaluation of an act\u2014how much the\ndecision-maker cares about benefits that obtain only in the top\n\\(p\\)-portion of states. (One could also think of the risk function as\ndescribing the solution to a distributive justice problem among\none\u2019s future possible selves\u2014it says how much weight a\ndecision-maker gives to the interests of the top \\(p\\)-portion of his\nfuture possible selves.) A risk-avoidant person is someone\nwith a convex risk function: as benefits obtain in a smaller and\nsmaller portion of states, he gives proportionally less and less\nweight to them. A risk-inclined person is someone with a\nconcave risk function. And a globally neutral person is\nsomeone with a linear risk function, i.e., an EU maximizer.\n\nDiminishing marginal value and global sensitivity are captured,\nrespectively, by the utility function and the risk function.\nFurthermore, the Allais preferences can be accommodated by a convex\nrisk function (Segal 1987, Prelec 1998, Buchak 2013; but see Thoma\n& Weisberg 2017). Thus, REU maximization holds that\ndecision-makers have the Allais preferences because they care more\nabout what happens in worse scenarios than better scenarios, or are\nmore concerned with the minimum value than potential gains above the\nminimum.\n\nThe representation theorem for REU combines conditions from two\nexisting theorems (Machina & Schmeidler 1992, K\u00f6bberling and\nWakker 2003), replacing the separability condition with two weaker\nconditions. One of these conditions fixes a unique probability\nfunction of events (Machina & Schmeidler\u2019s \u201cStrong\nComparative Probability\u201d, 1992) and the other fixes a unique\nrisk function of probabilities; the latter is a restricted version of\nthe separability condition (K\u00f6bberling & Wakker\u2019s\n[2003] \u201cComonotonic\u201d Tradeoff Consistency; see\n section 4.3.2).\n Since the representation theorem derives a unique probability\nfunction, a unique risk function, and a unique (up to positive affine\ntransformation) utility function, it separates the contribution of\ndiminishing marginal value and global sensitivity to a given\npreference ordering. One can disprefer mean-preserving spreads as a\nresult of either type of risk-aversion, or a combination of both.\n5.3 Normative Issues\n\nProposals that seek to retain EU but refine the outcome space face two\nparticular worries. One of these is that the constraints of decision\ntheory end up trivial (Dreier 1996); the other is that they saddle the\ndecision-maker with preferences over impossible objects (Broome\n1991).\n\nFor theories that reject the Sure-thing Principle or the Independence\nAxiom, several potential worries arise, including the worry that these\naxioms are intuitively correct (Harsanyi 1977, Savage 1954, Samuelson\n1952; see discussion in McClennen 1983, 1990); that decision-makers\nwill evaluate consequences inconsistently (Samuelson 1952, Broome\n1991); and that decision-makers will reject cost-free information\n(Good 1967, Wakker 1988, Buchak 2013, Ahmed & Salow 2019,\nCampbell-Moore & Salow 2020). The most widely discussed worry is\nthat these theories will leave decision-makers open to diachronic\ninconsistency (Raiffa 1968; Machina 1989; Hammond 1988; McClennen\n1988, 1990; Seidenfeld 1988a,b; Maher 1993; Rabinowicz 1995, 1997;\nBuchak 2013, 2015, 2017; Briggs 2015; Joyce 2017; Thoma 2019).",
