    "main_text": "Feminist Approaches to Bioethical Analysis || Power dynamics and social context\n3.1 Power dynamics and social context\n\nIn all societies we know of, human relationships are shaped by\narrangements of social and political power that favor men and enable\nthe oppression of women in a variety of ways, both covert and overt.\nFeminist bioethics looks at the micro-, meso-, and macro-level\norganizations of power in the moral difficulties that are encountered\nwithin healthcare and research. The examination of these power\nrelations not only provides a gendered reframing of bioethics\u2019\ntraditional clinical focus, for example by considering how paternalism\nin the doctor-patient dyad works differently according to the sex of\neach, but also provides a broader insight into the structural\nunderpinnings of seemingly isolated instances of moral wrong. In doing\nso, feminist bioethics extends in two dimensions beyond what is\nconventionally considered to fall within the confines of healthcare:\nto the previously unnoticed small-scale microaggressions (Freeman\n& Stewart 2019), and at the other end of the scale to the global\neconomic structures that maintain entrenched patterns of social and\npolitical domination over women\u2019s lives. Feminist bioethicists\nalso go beyond the analysis of sex and gender to consider how the\ndistribution of power plays out across other categories of race,\nsexual orientation, disability, age, and so on.\n\nThese broader analyses were a key factor in feminist bioethics\u2019\ninterest in the social determinants of health and in their\nunderstanding that structural social inequities are fundamental to\ngenerating differentials in people\u2019s health, anticipating by\nsome years the concerns of public health ethics articulated since the\nmid-2000s. Feminist authors, for example, have highlighted that the\ndistribution of political and economic power is visible in the way\nthat public health processes focus on the effects of social\nmarginalization and exclusion but pay less attention to the underlying\ncauses (Rogers 2006; Baylis, Kenny, & Sherwin 2008).\n",
