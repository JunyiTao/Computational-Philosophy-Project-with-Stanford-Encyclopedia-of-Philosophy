    "main_text": "Accommodation || Global and Local Accommodation\n5.1 Global and Local Accommodation\n\nWith these preliminaries out of the way, we turn to the first major\nquestion: Where are presuppositions accommodated? Though it\nmay seem odd at first, this question is inescapable if we assume, as\nis standard in dynamic semantics, that an expression may occur in\nseveral contexts at the same time (cf. Section 4.3). For Heim (1982),\nfollowing Lewis (1979), accommodation is a process whereby contexts\nare adjusted so as to make update possible when presuppositions are\nnot satisfied. In terms of her treatment of accommodation, Heim\u2019s\nmajor innovation over Lewis was to allow this process to take place\nnot only in the global context of utterance, but also on local\ncontexts found midway through an update. To illustrate, consider the\nfollowing:\n\n(34a)\n(c0) Maybe (c1) Betty is\ntrying to give up drinking.\n(34b)\n(c0) Maybe (c1) Wilma\nthinks that (c2) her husband is having an\naffair.\n\n\nHere c0 refers to the global context in which a\ngiven sentence is uttered, and c1and\nc2 are auxiliary, or local, contexts. In (34a),\nthe modal \u201cmaybe\u201d creates an auxiliary context of possible\nstates of affairs in which Betty is trying to give up drinking; the\nsame, mutatis mutandis, for (34b). The presupposition triggered in\n(34a), that Betty used to drink, can be accommodated\nglobally, i.e., in c0, or\nlocally, in c1. In the former case, the\nutterance is construed as meaning that Betty used to drink and may be\ntrying to kick the habit; in the latter, it conveys that, possibly,\nBetty used to drink and is trying to give up drinking. Likewise, in\n(34b), the presupposition that Wilma is married may be accommodated\nglobally, or locally in the most deeply embedded context. But here\nthere is a third option, as well: if the presupposition is\naccommodated in c1, the sentence is read as\n\u201cMaybe Wilma is married and she thinks that her husband is\nhaving an affair\u201d, and we speak of intermediate\naccommodation.\n\nIt is widely agreed that the following empirical generalization, made\nexplicit by Heim (1983), is correct:\n\nPGA: Global accommodation is preferred to non-global\naccommodation.\n\n\nWhile the PGA was initially based solely on intuitions, quantitative\nstudies on the speed of processing local and global interpretations\nhave since provided empirical support for it (e.g. Chemla and Bott\n2013 and Romoli and Schwartz 2014).\n\nIn the examples in (34) the PGA (preference for global accommodation)\nclearly holds: non-global interpretations may be possible, but they\nrequire special contexts. One such context may be that the\npresupposition contains a variable which is bound by a quantifier:\n\n(35)\nMost Germans wash their cars on Saturday.\n\n\nIn (35), with the possessive presupposition trigger \u201ctheir\ncars\u201d, there is a global context (outside of the scope of\n\u201cmost\u201d), a local context corresponding to the scope of the\nquantifier (occupied by the VP \u201cwash their cars on\nSaturday\u201d), and also an intermediate context in the restrictor\nof the quantifier (occupied by \u201cGermans\u201d). The most\nnatural interpretation of this sentence surely is that most Germans\nwho own a car wash it on Saturday. So in this case intermediate\naccommodation seems to be the preferred option, and this might be\nexplained, following van der Sandt (1992), by supposing that the\npossessive pronoun contains a variable bound by the quantifier.\n\nThere are other cases where intermediate accommodation is virtually\nimpossible:\n\n(36)\n(c0) If (c1) Fred is\ncoming to the reception, (c2) he may\n(c3) bring his wife.\n\n\nIt is quite unlikely that this may be construed, with intermediate\naccommodation in c1, which is the antecedent of\nthe conditional, as \u201cIf Fred is married and is coming to the\nreception, he may bring his wife.\u201d More generally, we don\u2019t know\nof any clear-cut cases (i.e., cases in which accommodation is not\nforced by independent contextual factors) in which a presupposition\ntriggered in the consequent of a conditional is accommodated in the\nantecedent.\n\nThe picture is rather confusing. While in some cases, e.g., (34b) or\n(35), intermediate accommodation seems possible and sometimes even\npreferred, in other cases it doesn\u2019t seem possible at all. And things\nget even more confused than this. Thus far, we have taken our examples\nat face value, but some authors have argued that we shouldn\u2019t because,\nas a matter of fact, intermediate accommodation doesn\u2019t exist. For\ninstance, according to Beaver (2001), the presupposition in (35) is\ntaken as evidence that the topic of conversation is car-owning\nGermans, and it is this topic that restricts the domain of the\nquantifier, making intermediate accommodation redundant. See also von\nFintel (1995) and Geurts and van der Sandt (1999) for discussion.\n\nReturning to the uncontested PGA, let us ask how it can be explained.\nHeim (1982) was not explicit about exactly how accommodation should\nwork and what should be accommodated. And oddly enough, although\nvirtually all theories of presupposition projection accept that the\nPGA holds, there haven\u2019t been that many attempts at explanation. One\ncandidate is what Beaver (2001) calls the \u201cAtlas\nPrinciple\u201d, after Atlas (1976):\n\nAP: One accommodation alternative is preferred to\nanother if the former yields a stronger meaning than the latter (i.e.,\nif the first meaning unilaterally entails the second).\n\nAdvocates of the Atlas Principle include, besides its eponym, Yeom\n(1998), Zeevat (1999), and Blutner (2000). One thing to note about the\nAtlas Principle is that it does not necessarily vindicate the PGA\nacross the board: while the predictions made by the Atlas Principle\nwill tend to comply with the PGA, they don\u2019t have to. However, it is\nsurprisingly difficult to say where exactly the Atlas Principle\ndeviates from the PGA, because this depends on various extraneous\nfactors; see Geurts (2000) for discussion.\n\nA major worry about the Atlas Principle is that it is ad hoc.\nDespite its soothing resemblance to Grice\u2019s second Quantity Maxim, it\nis questionable whether hearers generally prefer stronger\ninterpretations to weaker ones. This suggests that the Atlas Principle\nmay not be justified as an instance of a more general constraint, and\nis therefore stipulative. The sad and somewhat embarrassing truth\nseems to be that, thus far, we don\u2019t really know why the PGA should\nhold.\n\nOne last issue we would like to mention is that accommodation isn\u2019t\nalways equally easy (or hard). For example:\n\n(37a)\nFred is looking for the person.\n(37b)\nWilma is pregnant, too.\n\n\nIn (37a) the presupposition triggered by \u201cthe person\u201d\nclearly requires a salient discourse referent to hook on to; the\nsentence would be infelicitous when uttered out of the blue. The same\ngoes for the presupposition triggered by \u201ctoo\u201d in (37b),\nviz. that some salient person different from Wilma is pregnant. This\nsentence would be very peculiar when uttered out of the blue, or in\nany context where no salient person was under discussion who could be\npregnant. Put otherwise: unlike the presuppositions we have seen thus\nfar, it is very hard to deal with the presuppositions of \u201cthe\nperson\u201d or \u201ctoo\u201d by accommodation\n alone.[21]\n Why should this be so?\n\nVan der Sandt (1992) proposes that presuppositions whose descriptive\ncontent is relatively poor are hard to accommodate. This\ngeneralization is borne out by pronouns, names, and semantically\nattenuate definite NPs like \u201cthe person\u201d. However, it is\nnot very clear what \u201crelatively poor\u201d means. Definite NPs\nlike \u201cthe water molecule\u201d or \u201cthe lonely\ncarpenter\u201d don\u2019t strike us as particularly poor, but may be hard\nto interpret by way of accommodation. Similarly, the presuppositions\nassociated with \u201ctoo\u201d may be quite rich, and nevertheless\nthey are generally hard to accommodate. Geurts and van der Sandt\n(2004) propose to account for the latter by adopting Heim\u2019s (1992)\nidea that the presupposition triggered by \u201ctoo\u201d contains a\npronominal element, which blocks accommodation, but this proposal has\nbeen criticised by Beaver and Zeevat (2007). Be this as it may, it\nseems clear that van der Sandt\u2019s generalization cannot be read as\nbiconditional: even if poor presuppositions are difficult to\naccommodate, the reverse doesn\u2019t always hold.\n\nAnother problem with van der Sandt\u2019s generalization is that it is not\nclear how it can be justified. Even if it somehow makes sense that\nlack of descriptive content should make accommodation hard, we would\nlike to know more precisely why this should be so. A possible answer\nto this question may be found in the work on definites by Hawkins\n(1978), Clark and Marshall (1981), Heim (1982), and others. As Heim\nobserves, \u201caccommodation in response to definites is not\nnormally a matter of adding just the minimal amount of information\nthat would restore felicity.\u201d (Heim 1982, p. 372) It seems\nplausible that this holds for accommodation generally, and it arguably\nfollows from the nature of accommodation. If a presupposition is to be\ninterpreted by way of accommodation, new information is presented\nas if it were given, and it has often been observed that this\nwill only work if the information is not contentious or otherwise\nremarkable. That is to say, it should always be possible to\nintegrate the new information into the common ground: it has\nto be linked to what is already given. This will be hard with\nsemantically attenuate NPs like \u201cthe thing\u201d or pronouns\nlike \u201che\u201d, but also with richer definites whose content\ncannot readily be linked to anything in the common ground.\nNevertheless, it will generally be easy with richer presuppositions,\nnot because they have more content, but simply because they\nare more likely to contain anchors into the common ground.\n",
