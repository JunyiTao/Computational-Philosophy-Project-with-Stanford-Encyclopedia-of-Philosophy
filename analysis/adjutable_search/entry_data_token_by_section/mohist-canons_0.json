    "main_text": "Background and Overview\n1. Background and Overview\n\nThe\n early Mohists\n hoped to develop\n objective moral standards\n by which to unify society and achieve social order. Part of their\nsolution was to develop a theory of\n f\u01ce \u6cd5 (models, standards)\n that explained how to judge distinctions (bi\u00e0n\n\u8faf) between sh\u00ec \u662f (this, right) and\nf\u0113i \u975e (not-this, wrong). The core idea was to\nidentify clear, objective f\u01ce (models) to serve as\nparadigms for pattern recognition or analogical extension. Things\nrelevantly similar to, or \u201cmatching\u201d\n(zh\u00f2ng \u4e2d), the f\u01ce would be\nsh\u00ec (right, this); anything not relevantly similar\nwould be f\u0113i (wrong, not-this). The theory of\nf\u01ce applied not only to ethics but to other areas of\nthought as well. In epistemology, for instance, it could be applied to\nexplain what it is to know something: it is knowing how to correctly\ndistinguish what does or does not match the f\u01ce for that\nsort of thing. To determine whether some claim \u2018A is\nB\u2019 should be accepted, we compare A to the\nf\u01ce for B to see whether they are similar. To\ndetermine whether some doctrine is right, we can compare it to the\n \u201cthree models\u201d\u2014the\n deeds of the sage-kings, perceptual experience, and practical\nbenefit. In logic, the theory yields a model of analogical\nargumentation. For the Mohists, an assertion is the application of a\nterm to something. To support an assertion, we cite a f\u01ce\nfor the term we are asserting and then show that the thing we are\nasserting it of is relevantly similar to the f\u01ce. In\nphilosophy of language\u2014though early Mohist texts do not\nexplicitly take this step\u2014the theory could be applied to explain\nwhy words denote the things they do. The extensions of terms are\ndetermined by social practices in which we associate f\u01ce\nwith terms and distinguish what things do or do not match the\nf\u01ce. Everything that does is thereby properly referred to\nby the term in question. \n\nAccounts can be given at several levels to explain the correctness of\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i \u662f\u975e judgments. Most\nimmediately, sh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions seem to rest on\nsocial norms for distinguishing various kinds of things. This view is\nsuggested by how the Mohists describe the process by which we learn to\njudge sh\u00ec and f\u0113i: through conformity to\nthe model set by social superiors. According to the theory of the\n \u201cthree models,\u201d\n these norms for drawing distinctions rest in turn on three\nfundamental standards: the precedent set by wise leaders of the past,\nperceptual experience, and benefit to society. To some extent, then,\nthe norms have a real basis in perceptual experience and in whatever\nstrategies actually work, in practice, to promote\n\u201cbenefit,\u201d which the early Mohists understood as wealth,\npopulation, and social order. The Mohists also seem to have thought\nthey could ground at least some of these norms\u2014specifically,\nethical norms\u2014in the patterns of action exemplified by\nti\u0101n \u5929 (Heaven, nature) itself. The third of the\n\u201cthree models\u201d is also grounded in the norms that\nti\u0101n follows, specifically the norm of promoting benefit\nto all. So sh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions based on benefit\nare also, at least in an indirect sense, underwritten by\nti\u0101n. \n\nThe later Mohist texts present a more detailed and sophisticated\nversion of the same basic approach, grounded in the core notions of\nf\u01ce \u6cd5 (models), zh\u00f2ng \u4e2d\n(matching), sh\u00ec/f\u0113i (this/not-this)\n\u662f\u975e, and bi\u00e0n \u8faf (distinguishing).\nThey continue the search for objective standards of\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i by which to guide action and judgment,\nand they explore numerous philosophical issues arising along the way.\nFor instance, every sh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinction divides\nthe world into what is and is not a certain thing or kind of thing.\nBut why divide things up one way rather than another? What is it about\nparticular things that makes them fall on one side of a distinction\nrather than the other? In practice, how do we make the similarity\njudgment needed to determine which side a particular thing belongs on?\nSh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions are associated with\n\u201cnames\u201d (m\u00edng \u540d) and thus with\nlanguage. How do these distinctions underpin language and explain\ncommunication? What is their relation to knowledge? \n\nOne important difference from earlier Mohism is that the later texts\nseem to abandon the idea of grounding ethics or social norms in\n \u201cHeaven\u2019s intention\u201d\n (ti\u0101n zh\u00ec \u5929\u5fd7), or at least they\nsay nothing about it. This move would might seem to push Mohist ethics\ntoward a form of pragmatic consequentialism: the proper standards for\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions would be whatever tends to\npromote human welfare. Extending this idea to language and\nepistemology, we might expect the Mohists to adopt some form of\npragmatism or conventionalism, on which similarity distinctions\nbetween things are determined at least partly by human interests,\npractices, or conventions, presumably as they interact with\nhuman-independent features of the world. (One might argue that the\nearlier Mohists already held such a position concerning\nsh\u00ec/f\u0113i distinctions other than the fundamental\nethical sh\u00ec/f\u0113i identified by Heaven\u2019s\nintentions.) Yet, as Hansen suggests (1992, 242\u2013243), in a few\npassages, their position seems to lean toward a brand of realism, here\nunderstood as the view that the world in itself, independently of\nhuman activity, fixes the similarities by which things are divided\ninto kinds. It is unclear just how strong these realist tendencies\nare, however. The texts may be compatible with a view that allows some\nlatitude in the kind distinctions we recognize, provided they rest on\nat least some objective basis for distinguishing similarities and\ndifferences. \n",
