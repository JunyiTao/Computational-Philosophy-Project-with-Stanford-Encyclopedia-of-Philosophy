    "main_text": "\n\n\nGodfrey of Fontaines was one of the major philosopher-theologians to\nserve as Regent Master at the University of Paris in the final quarter\nof the thirteenth century, along with Henry of Ghent and Giles of Rome.\nAfter completing philosophical studies in the Faculty of Arts and\nbeginning to study theology probably by August, 1274, he became Regent\nMaster in Theology in 1285 and retained this position until 1303/1304.\nHis greatest contributions to philosophy were in the area of\nmetaphysics. He was positively influenced by Thomas Aquinas, but\ndiffered with him on various major points, and also seems to have been\ninfluenced by the Arts Master, Siger of Brabant. His might well be\ndescribed as a metaphysics of act and potency, since he often turns to\nthis in seeking to resolve metaphysical problems such as, for instance,\nthe relationship between essence and existence and between possible and\nactual being, the distinction between substance and accidents and\nbetween the soul and its powers, the causes of intellection and\nvolition, or the nature of prime matter and its relationship to\nsubstantial form. Overall his philosophical thought and especially his\nmetaphysics is somewhat more Aristotelian and less influenced by\nNeoplatonism than that of many of his contemporaries, including\nAquinas. \n\n",
