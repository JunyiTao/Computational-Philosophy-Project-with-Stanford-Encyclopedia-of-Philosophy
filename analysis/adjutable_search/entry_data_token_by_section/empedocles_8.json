    "main_text": "Purifications || Gods and daemons\n3.2 Gods and daemons\n\nThe prominence of the divine is made clear in the fragments of the\nPurifications. In an introduction or an introductory section,\nEmpedocles asks the Muse, Calliope, to aid his inspired discourse\nabout the \u201cblessed gods\u201d (B 131 = D 7). Who are these\nfigures? According to Hippolytus, Empedocles\u2019 gods include the\nfour elements\u2014Zeus, Hera, Aidoneus, and Nestis\u2014and the two\npowers, Love and Strife (Refutation of All Heresies 7.29).\nEach plays a crucial role in the cycle of transmigration outlined in\nthe poem: Strife governs the exile of the daemon; the elements hate\nand successively reject it; and the worship of Love creates the\nconditions for the daemon\u2019s restoration. This restoration to\ngodhood further expands the pantheon to include gods who enjoy a\nshared hearth and banqueting, the absence of human misery, and freedom\nfrom destruction (B 147 = D 40). They are subject to the divine\n\u201coracle of Necessity\u201d mandating against bloodshed and they\nfall into the cycle of transmigration after foreswearing it, becoming\ndaemons like Empedocles.\n\nDaemons constitute a sub-category of gods \u201cwho have received as\nlot a long life\u201d (B 115 = D 10), and by qualifying their\nimmortality Empedocles adapts their traditional association with fate\nand a protecting spirit for humans as is evident in, for example,\nHesiod (Erg. 122, 314). The cycle constantly renews the body\nof the daemon; in one fragment, a female subject is described as\n\u201cenveloping in an unfamiliar cloak of flesh\u201d (B 126 = D\n19) a figure regularly interpreted as the daemon. At the same time,\nthe fragments take for granted some set of stable qualities that are\nincrementally purified. In the absence of any Empedoclean discussion\nof the soul or an incorporeal carrier, scholars continue to debate the\nmaterial makeup of the daemon, with arguments for it as embodied Love\n(Kahn 1960); incorporeal imprints of the Sphere (Therme 2010); or\ncompounds of the roots (Tr\u00e9panier 2014). Presumably, unlike the\nroots and Love and Strife, these \u201clong-lived\u201d gods will be\nsubject to dissolution under the total reigns of Love or Strife (B 21\n= D 77a). \n\nDaemons occupy transient forms, incarnating into plant life, animals,\nand humans. Empedocles relates that they wander in these for thirty\nthousand seasons. Their exile on earth is well-expressed by Empedocles\nin his affirmation that while the daemon transmigrates, it neither\nreaches the abode of Zeus nor the palace of Hades (B 142 = D 12). It\nis a period of suffering and loss, underscoring the importance of the\nescape that is the daemon\u2019s return to godhood. Incarnation\nappears to form a \u201cladder\u201d. The highest order of plants is\nthe laurel, and of animals, the lion. Empedocles states of humans:\n\n\n\nAt the end they become seers, hymn singers, doctors, \n\nAnd leaders for humans on the earth, \n\nAnd then they blossom up as gods, the greatest in honors. (B 146 = D\n39)\n\n\nSince antiquity, these figures have been interpreted as ethically\nideal types, as closely allied with Love. If this is correct, then the\ndaemons have become purified of Strife at this end point in the cycle.\nAn alternative suggestion is that an alliance with Love and\npurification is unnecessary and that \u201ctime served\u201d is\nsufficient to graduate a daemon to godhood (Picot-Berg 2015). \n\nPerhaps the most important question mark surrounds the issue of the\nposition of the daemon in the wider cosmic alternation of Love and\nStrife. The fragments give no unequivocal direction on integrating\ntransmigration into the ultimate dissolution of the elements under\nStrife or their complete mixture under Love. Nor do scholars yet agree\non a methodology for approaching this issue (Marciano 2001). Much\nearlier scholarship rejected the compatibility of the cosmic and\ndaemonic cycles (Diels 1898). A related solution has been to suggest\nthat the cycle of the daemon is a mythological mirror of the physical\ncycles of Love and Strife (Primavesi 2008). More often, interpreters\nattempted to unite the cycles of transmigration within the broader\nmovements toward the one and the many. This suggests that there is no\neternal paradise for the daemon after attaining godhood again. \n",
