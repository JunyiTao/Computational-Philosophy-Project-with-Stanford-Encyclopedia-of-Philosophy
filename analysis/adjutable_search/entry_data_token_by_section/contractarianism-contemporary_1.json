    "main_text": "The Role of the Social Contract || The Social Contract as a Model\n1.2 The Social Contract as a Model\n\nThe social contract is a model of rational justification that\ntransforms the problem of justification (what reasons individuals\nhave) into a problem of deliberation (what rules they will agree to).\nAs Rawls argues:\n\n[T]he question of justification is settled by working out a problem of\ndeliberation: we have to ascertain which principles it would be\nrational to adopt given the contractual situation. This connects the\ntheory of justice with the theory of rational choice (Rawls 1999, 16).\n\n\nJustification is not a \u201cmere proof\u201d (Rawls 1999a 508), nor\nis it reasoning from given or generally accepted premises to\nconclusions about political legitimacy or morality (Rawls 1980, p.\n518). Rather, the contractual model makes explicit the reasoning that\nconnects our standpoint as persons with determinate interests and\ngoals to our standpoint as citizens.\n\nAt the simplest level, models take something complex and make it\nsimpler. Along these lines, both the economist Ariel Rubinstein (2012)\nand the philosopher Nancy Cartwright (1991) compare models to fables.\nFables are stories that communicate some important lesson in a simple,\neasy-to-understand fashion. Fables, like models, communicate important\ngeneral rules through particular, though fictional, cases.\n\nModels involve abstraction and idealization, but they do more than\nthat: they help us see what our key assumptions are, identify the\nfactors that we see as relevant (Gaus 2016, xv-xvii). Models, as\ntechniques of idealization, do more than abstract (Weisberg 2007a,\n2013). Consider the periodic table of the elements. It is an\nabstraction, but not a model according to Michael Weisberg. He calls\nabstractions like the periodic table abstract direct\nrepresentations to distinguish them from models (2007b). Modeling\nseeks to isolate the important features of the target phenomena,\nallowing the modeler to understand and manipulate important elements\nof the phenomena in simulations. John Rawls\u2019s representatives to\nthe original position, for instance, are not only abstractions of real\npersons. They are idealizations that isolate particular aspects of\npersons that are relevant to justification as a choice, specifically\ntheir thin theory of rationality, and their values (in the form of\nprimary goods). Isolating these features is important for modeling the\nagreement procedure in Rawls\u2019s theory.\n\nGiven this, we can think of social contract theories as having a\ngeneral schematic form. Social contract theories are models of\njustification with several general parameters that are set differently\nin different theories. What distinguishes contractarian theories is\nhow they specify these general parameters (Thrasher 2019). The goal of\nthe model is to represent our reasons for endorsing and complying with\nsome set of social rules, principles, or norms. This is done by\nshowing that our representatives in the model would agree to a given\nset of these rules, principles, or norms in a suitably constructed\nchoice situation. What \u201csuitably constructed\u201d means here\nwill depend on the other parameters in the model.\n\nCritically, there are two sets of relevant individuals (N and\nN*). The first set is the representative choosers\n(N) constructed in the \u201cdevice of representation\u201d\nsuch as the original position (Rawls 1996, 27). The second set\n(N*) is composed of real individuals whose terms of\ninteraction are to be guided by the contract/agreement. If the\ndeliberations of the contractors (N) are to be relevant to\nthe actual participants (N*), the reasoning of the former\nmust, in some way, be shared by the latter. There is, however,\nconsiderable debate about what it means for reasons to be shared in\nthis sense (see\n Public Reason\n and\n Public Justification).\n The other main parameter in the model is the deliberative setting\n(M), in which the model choosers (N) endorse some\nrules, principles, or norms (R).\n\nGiven all of this, we can identify a general model of social contract\ntheories:\n\nGeneral Model of the Social Contract: N\nchooses R in M and this gives N* reason to\nendorse and comply with R in the real world insofar as the\nreasons N has for choosing R in M can be\nshared by N*.\n\nEach of these parameters (N,M,R,N*) can be specified in any\nnumber of ways. The shape of a particular contractual theory depends\non the precise way these parameters are set in the theory.\n",
