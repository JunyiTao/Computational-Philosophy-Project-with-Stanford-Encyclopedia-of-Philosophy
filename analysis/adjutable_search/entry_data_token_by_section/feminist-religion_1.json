    "main_text": "Feminist Critique of Traditional Philosophy of Religion\n2. Feminist Critique of Traditional Philosophy of Religion\n\nTo Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1885 it was evident that \u201cHistory\nshows that the moral degradation of woman is due more to theological\nsuperstitions than to all other influences together\u201d (1885:\n389). To Luce Irigaray, writing one hundred years later, the becoming\nof women was premised on becoming divine, for \n\n\nGod alone can save us, keep us safe. The feeling or experience of a\npositive, objective, glorious existence, the feeling of subjectivity,\nis essential for us. Just like a God who helps us and leads us in the\npath of becoming, who keeps track of our limits and infinite\npossibilities\u2014as women\u2014who inspires our projects. (1987\n[1993b: 67]) \n\n\nScalding critiques like Stanton\u2019s and reconstructive reflections like\nIrigaray\u2019s have marked feminist philosophy of religion with a complex\nset of relations to the subject matter of religion, as well as to the\ndiscipline of philosophy. In the wake of a worldwide wave of religious\nresurgence at the beginning of the twenty-first century, many\nfeminists find Stanton\u2019s reasoning still persuasive: the Word of God\nis the word of man, used to keep women in subjection and to hinder\ntheir emancipation. For other feminists, especially those located\nwithin various communities of faith and resistance, gynocentric\nefforts to create a possible space for something \u201cdivine\u201d\nhold considerable appeal.\n\nAs a form of critique, feminist philosophy of religion employs the\npractice described by Jeffner Allen and Iris Marion Young (1989) of showing the limits of a\nmode of thinking by forging an awareness of alternative, more\nliberating, ideas, symbols, and discourses. Feminist philosophy of\nreligion suggests ways in which gender as an analytic category and\ngender studies as a body of knowledge can not only challenge but also\nenrich and inform the methodological and substantive assumptions of\nphilosophy of religion. This does not mean that gender hierarchy\ncomprises a simple or exclusive category of analysis. Nor does it\nnecessarily invoke a distinction between gender and sex that would\nallow naturalized assumptions about the sexed body to go unquestioned.\nGiven the interflowing streams of class, race, ethnicity, age, sexual\norientation, ability, and nationality that shape the complex\nmodalities of social experience, it is unlikely that gender or any\nother single factor could suffice as a single or unitary focal point.\nWomen cannot be presumed to speak in a single voice or to share a\nuniform \u201cexperience\u201d. Nevertheless, gender constitutes\nperhaps the most fundamental factor creating human difference, and it\nremains among the most ignored philosophically.\n\nGender bias as it operated in the history of the philosophy of\nreligion shaped the ways in which the traditional problems and\norientations of the field were constructed. Like the cultural\nphenomenon of religion itself, philosophy of religion not only\noriginated in a male tradition of production and transmission, with a\nhistory of excluding and devaluing women, but it was also defined by\nmany concepts and symbols marked as \u201cmasculine\u201d, which\nstood in oppositional relation to those marked as\n\u201cfeminine\u201d. Moreover, unlike the phenomenon of religion\nwhich was embedded in multiple cultural contexts, philosophy of\nreligion was largely Eurocentric and Anglo-American in its\norientation, such that in addition to gender bias, ethnocentrism\nconstituted the second major weakness of the history of this field.\nFor a long time, philosophy of religion was written from a standpoint\nnot unlike that of Reverend Thwackum, the character in Henry\nFielding\u2019s novel Tom Jones, who announced: \n\n\nWhen I mention religion, I mean the Christian religion; and not only\nthe Christian religion, but the Protestant religion; and not only the\nProtestant religion, but the Church of England. (Fielding 1749: vol.\n1, bk 3, ch. 3) \n\n\nIf not always the Church of England, it was for the most part\nProtestant Christianity that was conflated with \u201creligion\u201d\nin the modern period of philosophy of religion.\n\nUndaunted by two such severe deficiencies\u2014gender bias and\nethnocentrism\u2014the dominant Anglo-American analytic school of\nphilosophy of religion proved surprisingly healthy in the last decades\nof the twentieth century. Whereas at the mid-point of the twentieth\ncentury philosophy of religion was virtually defined by the\nassumptions and methods of logical positivism and empiricism, in\nsubsequent years new and technically rigorous contributions by\nreligiously committed philosophers began to enliven old theistic\narguments. After long decades of dormancy when logical positivism\nseemed to yield only negative conclusions in the philosophy of\nreligion, a resurgence of interest in traditional theism occurred in\nmainstream philosophy of religion. Modal logic was used to formulate a\nmore perspicacious version of the ontological argument, Bayesian\nmodels of probability breathed new life into inductive justifications\nof religious belief, rational choice theory ushered Pascal\u2019s wager\nonce again onto the philosophical stage, and language-game analysis\noffered a prima facie justification of religious language.\nFar from the days of wondering what Athens has to do with Jerusalem,\nphilosophy and religion appeared to have entered a period of detente\nas comrades in arms. From the standpoint of feminist critique,\nhowever, analytic philosophy of religion has failed to engage the\nquestions posed by feminist inquiry or to modify the androcentric\nelements of the traditional theistic model. Instead, in the work of\nsuch philosophers as Richard Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, and William\nAlston, philosophy of religion was deployed in defense of the cogency\nof a standard form of western monotheism, in the service of a\nconception of \u201cGod\u201d that was patriarchal, and in the\nvested interests of staunchly traditional forms of Christianity.\n\nFeminists argue that philosophy of religion can hardly ignore\nquestions of gender ideology when its very subject\nmatter\u2014religion\u2014is riddled with misogyny and\nandrocentrism. They point out that, historically, gender bias in\nreligion has been neither accidental nor superficial. Elizabeth\nJohnson (1993) likens it to a buried continent whose subaqueous pull\nshaped all the visible landmass; androcentric bias has massively\ndistorted every aspect of the terrain and rendered invisible,\ninconsequential, or nonexistent the experience and significance of\nhalf the human race. For philosophers studying the intellectual\neffects and belief systems of religions, the opportunity to critique\nand correct sexist and patriarchal constructions in this field is as\nample as it is urgent, given the presence of gender ideology in all\nknown religions. Not one of the religions of the world has been\ntotally affirming of women\u2019s personhood. Every one of them conforms to\nHeidi Hartmann\u2019s definition of patriarchy as \n\n\nrelations between men, which have a material base, and which, though\nhierarchical, establish or create interdependence and solidarity among\nmen that enable them to dominate women. (1981: 14) \n\n\nAll sacred literatures of the world display an unvarying ambivalence\non the subject of women. For every text that places well-domesticated\nwomanhood on a religious pedestal, another one announces that, if\nuncontrolled, women are the root of all evil. Religion has thus\ncomprised a primary space in which and by means of which gender\nhierarchy has been culturally articulated, reinforced, and\nconsolidated in institutionalized form. Religion is hardly the only\nsuch space, but it appears to have been a particularly effective way\nof undergirding and sanctifying gender hierarchy in the West.\n\nFeminists charge that gender bias has permeated the way philosophy of\nreligion has been written and has influenced how the field has been\nprofessionalized. They protest a series of common lapses: the dearth\nof female authors in the leading journals or standard textbooks; the\nalmost complete absence of attention to feminist philosophy on the\npart of mainstream authors, male and female; the exclusively\nmale-authored and monochromatic complexion of the standard anthologies\nof readings and editorial boards. They note that the use of inclusive\nlanguage was remarkably slow in finding its way into the scholarly\npublications and conceptual patterns of this field. It is still not\nunusual to find articles that discuss concepts of justice and fairness\nat length, using throughout the male pronoun.\n\nMore difficult lacunae are located in the selection of the very\ntopics, problems, and methods that have come to define mainstream\nphilosophy of religion, chief among them the problem of God.\n",
