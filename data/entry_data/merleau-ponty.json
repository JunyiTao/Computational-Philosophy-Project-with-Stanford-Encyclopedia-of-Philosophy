    "preamble": "\n\nMaurice Jean Jacques Merleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961), French\nphilosopher and public intellectual, was the leading academic\nproponent of existentialism and phenomenology in post-war France. Best\nknown for his original and influential work on embodiment, perception,\nand ontology, he also made important contributions to the philosophy\nof art, history, language, nature, and politics. Associated in his\nearly years with the existentialist movement through his friendship\nwith Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, Merleau-Ponty played a\ncentral role in the dissemination of phenomenology, which he sought to\nintegrate with Gestalt psychology, psychoanalysis, Marxism, and\nSaussurian linguistics. Major influences on his thinking include Henri\nBergson, Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Max Scheler, and Jean-Paul\nSartre, as well as neurologist Kurt Goldstein, Gestalt theorists such\nas Wolfgang K\u00f6hler and Kurt Koffka, and literary figures\nincluding Marcel Proust, Paul Claudel, and Paul Val\u00e9ry. In\nturn, he influenced the post-structuralist generation of French\nthinkers who succeeded him, including Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze,\nand Jacques Derrida, whose similarities with and debt to the later\nMerleau-Ponty have often been underestimated. Merleau-Ponty published\ntwo major theoretical texts during his lifetime: The Structure of\nBehavior (1942 SC) and Phenomenology of Perception (1945\nPP). Other important publications include two volumes of political\nphilosophy, Humanism and Terror (1947 HT) and Adventures\nof the Dialectic (1955 AdD), as well as two books of collected\nessays on art, philosophy, and politics: Sense and Non-Sense\n([1948]1996b/1964) and Signs (1960/1964). Two unfinished\nmanuscripts appeared posthumously: The Prose of the World\n(1969/1973), drafted in 1950\u201351; and The Visible and the\nInvisible (1964 V&I), on which he was working at the time of\nhis death. Lecture notes and student transcriptions of many of his\ncourses at the University of Lyon, the Sorbonne, and the\nColl\u00e8ge de France have been published, as well as a number of\npreviously unpublished manuscript fragments, lectures, working notes,\ntranscriptions of recordings, and letters.\n\nFor most of his career, Merleau-Ponty focused on the problems of\nperception and embodiment as a starting point for clarifying the\nrelation between the mind and the body, the objective world and the\nexperienced world, expression in language and art, history, politics,\nand nature. Although phenomenology provided the overarching framework\nfor these investigations, Merleau-Ponty also drew freely on empirical\nresearch in psychology and ethology, anthropology, psychoanalysis,\nlinguistics, and the arts. His constant points of historical reference\nare Descartes, Kant, Hegel, and Marx. The characteristic approach of\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s theoretical work is his effort to identify an\nalternative to intellectualism or idealism, on the one hand, and\nempiricism or realism, on the other, by critiquing their common\npresupposition of a ready-made world and failure to account for the\nhistorical and embodied character of experience. In his later\nwritings, Merleau-Ponty becomes increasingly critical of the\nintellectualist tendencies of the phenomenological method as well,\nalthough with the intention of reforming rather than abandoning it.\nThe posthumous writings collected in The Visible and the\nInvisible aim to clarify the ontological implications of a\nphenomenology that would self-critically account for its own\nlimitations. This leads him to propose concepts such as\n\u201cflesh\u201d and \u201cchiasm\u201d that many consider to be\nhis most fruitful philosophical contributions.\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s thought has continued to inspire contemporary\nresearch beyond the usual intellectual history and interpretive\nscholarship, especially in the areas of feminist philosophy,\nphilosophy of mind and cognitive science, environmental philosophy and\nphilosophy of nature, ethics, political philosophy, philosophy of art,\nphilosophy of language, and phenomenological ontology. The emerging\ndiscourse of \u201ccritical phenomenology,\u201d in particular, has\nexplored what Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought can contribute to\nunderstanding and responding to racism, sexism, heteronormativity,\ncolonialism, ableism, ageism, and other contemporary forms of violence\nand oppression. His work has also been widely influential on\nresearchers outside the discipline of philosophy proper, especially in\nanthropology, architecture, the arts, cognitive science, environmental\ntheory, film studies, linguistics, literature, political theory, and\npsychopathology.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Life and Works\n\nMerleau-Ponty was born in Rochefort-sur-Mer, in the province of\nCharente-Maritime, on March 14,\n 1908.[1]\n After the death in 1913 of his father, a colonial artillery captain\nand a knight of the Legion of Honor, he moved with his family to\nParis. He would later describe his childhood as incomparably happy,\nand he remained very close to his mother until her death in 1953.\nMerleau-Ponty pursued secondary studies at the Parisian lycees\nJanson-de-Sailly and Louis-le-Grand, completing his first course in\nphilosophy at Janson-de-Sailly with Gustave Rodrigues in\n1923\u201324. He won the school\u2019s \u201cAward for Outstanding\nAchievement\u201d in philosophy that year and would later trace his\ncommitment to the vocation of philosophy to this first course. He was\nalso awarded \u201cFirst Prize in Philosophy\u201d at Louis-le-Grand\nin 1924\u201325. He attended the \u00c9cole Normale\nSup\u00e9rieure from 1926 to 1930, where he befriended Simone de\nBeauvoir and Claude\n L\u00e9vi-Straus.[2]\n Some evidence suggests that, during these years, Merleau-Ponty\nauthored a novel, Nord. R\u00e9cit de l\u2019arctique,\nunder the pseudonym Jacques Heller (Alloa 2013b). His professors at\nENS included L\u00e9on Brunschvicg and \u00c9mile Br\u00e9hier,\nthe latter supervising his research on Plotinus for the Dipl\u00f4me\nd\u2019\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieures in 1929. Br\u00e9hier would\ncontinue to supervise Merleau-Ponty\u2019s research through the\ncompletion of his two doctoral dissertations in 1945. During his\nstudent years, Merleau-Ponty attended Husserl\u2019s 1929 Sorbonne\nlectures and Georges Gurvitch\u2019s 1928\u20131930 courses on\nGerman philosophy. He received the agr\u00e9gation in\nphilosophy in 1930, ranking in second place.\n\nAfter a year of mandatory military service, Merleau-Ponty taught at\nthe lycee in Beauvais from 1931 to 1933, pursued a year of research on\nperception funded by a subvention from the Caisse nationale des\nsciences (the precursor of today\u2019s Centre national de la\nrecherche scientifique) in 1933\u201334, and taught at the lycee in\nChartres in 1934\u201335. From 1935 to 1940, he was a tutor\n(ag\u00e9g\u00e9-r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur) at the\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, where his primary duty was to\nprepare students for the agr\u00e9gation. During this\nperiod, he attended Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve\u2019s lectures on Hegel\nand Aron Gurwitsch\u2019s lectures on Gestalt psychology. His first\npublications also appeared during these years, as a series of review\nessays on Max Scheler\u2019s Ressentiment (1935), Gabriel\nMarcel\u2019s Being and Having (1936), and Sartre\u2019s\nImagination\n (1936).[3]\n In 1938, he completed his th\u00e8se\ncompl\u00e9mentaire, originally titled Conscience et\ncomportement [Consciousness and Behavior] and published\nin 1942 as La structure du comportement [The Structure of\nBehavior, SC]. He was the first outside visitor to the newly\nestablished Husserl Archives in Louvain, Belgium, in April 1939, where\nhe met Eugen Fink and consulted Husserl\u2019s unpublished\nmanuscripts, including Ideen II and later sections of Die\nKrisis.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War Two, Merleau-Ponty served for a year as\nlieutenant in the 5th Infantry Regiment and 59th\nLight Infantry Division, until he was wounded in battle in June 1940,\ndays before the signing of the armistice between France and Germany.\nHe was awarded the Croix de guerre, recognizing bravery in\ncombat. After several months of convalescence, he returned to teaching\nat the Lyc\u00e9e Carnot in Paris, where he remained from 1940 until\n1944. In November 1940, he married Suzanne Jolibois, and their\ndaughter Marianne was born in June 1941. In the winter of\n1940\u201341, Merleau-Ponty renewed his acquaintance with Jean-Paul\nSartre, whom he had met as a student at the \u00c9cole Normale,\nthrough their involvement in the resistance group Socialisme et\nLibert\u00e9. The group published around ten issues of an\nunderground review until the arrest of two members in early 1942 led\nto its dissolution. After the conclusion of the war, in 1945,\nMerleau-Ponty would collaborate with Sartre and Beauvoir to found\nLes Temps Modernes, a journal devoted to\n\u201clitt\u00e9rature engag\u00e9e\u201d, for which he served\nas political editor until 1952.\n\nAt the end of the 1943\u201344 school year, Merleau-Ponty completed\nhis main thesis, Ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nologie de la\nperception [Phenomenology of Perception, PP], and in\n1944\u201345 he taught at the Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet in Paris,\nreplacing Sartre during the latter\u2019s leave from this position.\nMerleau-Ponty defended his two dissertations in July 1945, fulfilling\nthe requirements for the Docteur \u00e8s lettres, which was\nawarded \u201cwith distinction\u201d. In October 1945, Les Temps\nModernes published its inaugural issue; Merleau-Ponty was a\nfounding member of the journal\u2019s governing board, managed its\ndaily affairs, and penned many of its editorials that were signed\nsimply \u201cT.M.\u201d, even though he refused to allow his name to\nbe printed on the cover alongside Sartre\u2019s as the review\u2019s\nDirector. That fall, Merleau-Ponty was appointed to the post of\nMa\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences in Psychology at the\nUniversity of Lyon, where he was promoted to the rank of Professor in\nthe Chair of Psychology in 1948. From 1947 to 1949, he also taught\nsupplementary courses at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure,\nwhere his students included the young Michel Foucault. Student notes\n(taken by Jean Deprun) from Merleau-Ponty\u2019s 1947\u201348 course\non \u201cThe Union of the Soul and the Body in Malebranche, Biran,\nand Bergson\u201d\u2014a course that he taught at both Lyon and\nE.N.S. to prepare students for the agr\u00e9gation and\nwhich was attended by Foucault\u2014were published in 1968\n(1997b/2001). Merleau-Ponty\u2019s notes for several other courses\ntaught at Lyon\u2014\u201cFreedom, especially in Leibniz,\u201d\n\u201cHegel\u2019s Aesthetics,\u201d and \u201cProblems of the\nPhilosophy of History,\u201d were published in 2022 (2022a,\n2022b).\n\nIn 1946 and 1947, Merleau-Ponty gave a number of lectures on French\nexistentialism in Belgium and Scandinavia (2022a), and in 1947 he\nparticipated regularly in the Coll\u00e8ge philosophique, an\nassociation formed by Jean Wahl to provide an open venue for\nintellectual exchange without the academic formality of the Sorbonne,\nand frequented by many leading Parisian thinkers. Merleau-Ponty\npublished his first book of political philosophy in 1947,\nHumanisme et terreur, essai sur le probl\u00e8me communiste\n[Humanism and Terror: An Essay on the Communist Problem,\n1969, HT], in which he responded to the developing opposition between\nliberal democracies and communism by cautioning a\n\u201cwait-and-see\u201d attitude toward Marxism. A collection of\nessays concerning the arts, philosophy, and politics, Sens et\nnon-sense [Sense and Non-Sense, 1996b/1964], appeared in\n1948. In the fall of 1948, Merleau-Ponty delivered a series of seven\nweekly lectures on French national radio that were subsequently\npublished as Causeries 1948 (2002/2004).\n\nMerleau-Ponty declined an invitation to join the Department of\nPhilosophy at the University of Chicago as a Visiting Professor in\n1948\u201349, but instead received a leave from Lyon for the year to\npresent a series of lectures in Mexico and New York in early 1949\n(2022b). Later in 1949, Merleau-Ponty was appointed Professor of Child\nPsychology and Pedagogy at the University of Paris 1\nPanth\u00e9on-Sorbonne, and in this position lectured widely on\nchild development, psychoanalysis, phenomenology, Gestalt psychology,\nand anthropology. His eight courses from the Sorbonne are known from\ncompiled student notes reviewed by him and published in the\nSorbonne\u2019s Bulletin de psychologie (1988/2010).\nMerleau-Ponty held this position for three years until his election,\nin 1952, to the Chair of Philosophy at the Coll\u00e8ge de France,\nthe most prestigious post for a philosopher in France, which he would\nhold until his death in 1961. At forty-four, Merleau-Ponty was the\nyoungest person ever elected to this position, but his appointment was\nnot without controversy. Rather than following the typical procedure\nof ratifying the vote of the General Assembly of Professors, who had\nselected Merleau-Ponty as their lead candidate, the\nAcad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques made the\nunprecedented decision to remove his name from the list of candidates;\nthe Acad\u00e9mie\u2019s decision was subsequently\noverturned by the Minister of Education himself, who allowed the\nfaculty vote in favor of Merleau-Ponty to stand. Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nJanuary 1953 inaugural lecture at the Coll\u00e8ge de France was\npublished under the title \u00c9loge de la Philosophie\n[In Praise of Philosophy, 1953/1963]. Many of his courses\nfrom the Coll\u00e8ge de France have subsequently been published,\nbased either on student notes or Merleau-Ponty\u2019s own lecture\nnotes (1964b, 1968/1970, 1995/2003, 1996a/2022, 1998/2002, 2003/2010,\n2011/2020, 2013, 2020).\n\nIn the face of growing political disagreements with Sartre set in\nmotion by the Korean War, Merleau-Ponty resigned his role as political\neditor of Les Temps Modernes in December of 1952 and withdrew\nfrom the editorial board altogether in 1953. His critique of\nSartre\u2019s politics became public in 1955 with Les Aventures\nde la dialectique [Adventures of the Dialectic, 1973\nAdD], in which Merleau-Ponty distanced himself from revolutionary\nMarxism and sharply criticized Sartre for\n\u201cultrabolshevism\u201d. Beauvoir\u2019s equally biting\nrebuttal, \u201cMerleau-Ponty and Pseudo-Sartreanism\u201d,\npublished the same year in Les Temps Modernes, accuses\nMerleau-Ponty of willfully misrepresenting Sartre\u2019s position,\nopening a rift between the three former friends that would never\nentirely heal. Merleau-Ponty\u2019s intellectual circle during his\nyears at the Coll\u00e8ge de France included L\u00e9vi-Straus and\nJacques Lacan, and for several years he was a regular contributor to\nthe popular weekly magazine L\u2019Express. In October and\nNovember 1955, on a commission from Alliance\nfran\u00e7aise, Merleau-Ponty visited several African\ncountries, including Tunisia, French Equatorial Africa, the Belgian\nCongo, and Kenya, where he delivered a series of lectures on the\nconcept of race, colonialism, and development. In 1956, he published\nLes Philosophes c\u00e9l\u00e8bres [Famous\nPhilosophers], a large edited volume of original introductions to\nkey historical and contemporary thinkers (beginning, interestingly,\nwith philosophers from India and China) whose contributors included\nGilles Deleuze, Gilbert Ryle, Alfred Schutz, and Jean Starobinski. In\nApril 1957, Merleau-Ponty declined to accept induction into\nFrance\u2019s Order of the Legion of Honor, presumably in protest\nover the inhumane actions of the Fourth Republic, including the use of\ntorture, during the Battle of Algiers. In October and November of\n1957, as his second commission from Alliance\nfran\u00e7aise, he lectured in Madagascar, Reunion Island, and\nMauritius, citing as a primary motivation for accepting the commission\nhis desire to see first-hand the effects of reforms in French policies\ngoverning overseas territories. The last book Merleau-Ponty published\nduring his lifetime, Signes [Signs, 1960/1964],\nappearing in 1960, collecting essays on art, language, the history of\nphilosophy, and politics that spanned more than a decade. His last\npublished essay, \u201cL\u2019\u0152il et l\u2019esprit\u201d\n[\u201cEye and Mind\u201d, 1964a OEE] addressing the ontological\nimplications of painting, appeared in the 1961 inaugural issue of\nArt de France. Merleau-Ponty died of a heart attack in Paris\non May 3rd, 1961, at the age of 53, with Descartes\u2019\nOptics open on his desk.\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s friend and former student Claude Lefort\npublished two of his teacher\u2019s unfinished manuscripts\nposthumously: La prose du monde [The Prose of the\nWorld, 1969/1973], an exploration of literature and expression\ndrafted in 1950\u201351 and apparently abandoned; and Le visible\net l\u2019invisible [The Visible and the Invisible,\n1968 V&I], a manuscript and numerous working notes from\n1959\u20131961 that present elements of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s mature\nontology. The latter manuscript was apparently part of a larger\nproject, \u00catre et Monde [Being and World], for\nwhich two additional unpublished sections were substantially drafted\nin 1957\u20131958: La Nature ou le monde du silence\n[Nature or the World of Silence] and Introduction\n\u00e0 l\u2019ontologie [Introduction to Ontology]\n(Saint Aubert 2013:\n 28).[4]\n These manuscripts, along with many of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s other\nunpublished notes and papers, were donated to the Biblioth\u00e8que\nNationale de France by Suzanne Merleau-Ponty in 1992 and are available\nfor consultation by\n scholars.[5]\n Several volumes of previously unpublished lectures, working notes,\ninterview transcriptions, letters, and other archival materials have\nalso been published posthumously (2016, 2018, 2022a, 2022b,\n2022c).\n2. The Nature of Perception and The Structure of Behavior\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s lifelong interest in the philosophical status of\nperception is already reflected in his successful 1933 application for\na subvention to study the nature of perception, where he proposes to\nsynthesize recent findings in experimental psychology (especially\nGestalt psychology) and neurology to develop an alternative to\ndominant intellectualist accounts of perception inspired by critical\n(Kantian) philosophy. Interestingly, this early proposal emphasizes\nthe significance of the perception of one\u2019s own body for\ndistinguishing between the \u201cuniverse of perception\u201d and\nits intellectual reconstructions, and it gestures toward the\n\u201crealist philosophers of England and America\u201d (presumably\nWilliam James and A. N. Whitehead, as presented in Jean Wahl\u2019s\n1932 Vers le concret) for their insights into the\nirreducibility of the sensory and the concrete to intellectual\nrelations. While this initial proposal makes no mention of\nphenomenology, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s subsequent 1934 report on the\nyear\u2019s research, noting the limitations of approaching the\nphilosophical study of perception through empirical research alone,\nemphasizes the promise of Husserlian phenomenology for providing a\ndistinctively philosophical framework for the investigation of\npsychology. In particular, Merleau-Ponty mentions the distinction\nbetween the natural and transcendental attitudes and the\nintentionality of consciousness as valuable for \u201crevising the\nvery notions of consciousness and sensation\u201d (NP: 192/78). He\nalso cites approvingly Aron Gurwitsch\u2019s claim that\nHusserl\u2019s analyses \u201clead to the threshold of\nGestaltpsychologie\u201d, the second area of focus in this\nearly study. The Gestalt is \u201ca spontaneous organization of the\nsensory field\u201d in which there are \u201conly organizations,\nmore or less stable, more or less articulated\u201d (NP: 193/79).\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s brief summary of Gestalt psychology,\nanticipating research presented in his first two books, emphasizes the\nfigure-ground structure of perception, the phenomena of depth and\nmovement, and the syncretic perception of children. Nevertheless,\nMerleau-Ponty concludes\u2014again citing Gurwitsch\u2014that the\nepistemological framework of Gestalt psychology remains Kantian,\nrequiring that one look \u201cin a very different direction, for a\nvery different solution\u201d to the problem of the relation between\nthe world described naturalistically and the world as perceived (NP:\n198/82).\n\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s first book, The Structure of Behavior\n(SC), resumes the project of synthesizing and reworking the insights\nof Gestalt theory and phenomenology to propose an original\nunderstanding of the relationship between consciousness and nature.\nWhereas the neo-Kantian idealism then dominant in France (e.g.,\nL\u00e9on Brunschvicg, Jules Lachelier) treated nature as an\nobjective unity dependent on the synthetic activity of consciousness,\nthe realism of the natural sciences and empirical psychology assumed\nnature to be composed of external things and events interacting\ncausally. Merleau-Ponty argues that neither approach is tenable:\norganic life and human consciousness are emergent from a natural world\nthat is not reducible to its meaning for a mind; yet this natural\nworld is not the causal nexus of pre-existing objective realities,\nsince it is fundamentally composed of nested Gestalts, spontaneously\nemerging structures of organization at multiple levels and degrees of\nintegration. On the one hand, the idealist critique of naturalism\nshould be extended to the naturalistic assumptions framing Gestalt\ntheory. On the other hand, there is a justified truth in naturalism\nthat limits the idealist universalization of consciousness, and this\nis discovered when Gestalt structures are recognized to be\nontologically basic and the limitations of consciousness are thereby\nexposed. The notion of \u201cbehavior\u201d, taken by Merleau-Ponty\nas parallel to the phenomenological concept of\n\u201cexperience\u201d (in explicit contrast with the American\nschool of behaviorism), is a privileged starting point for the\nanalysis thanks to its neutrality with respect to classical\ndistinctions between the \u201cmental\u201d and the\n\u201cphysiological\u201d (SC: 2/4).\n\nThe Structure of Behavior first critiques traditional reflex\naccounts of the relation between stimulus and reaction in light of the\nfindings of Kurt Goldstein and other contemporary physiologists,\narguing that the organism is not passive but imposes its own\nconditions between the given stimulus and the expected response, so\nthat behavior remains inexplicable in purely anatomical or atomistic\nterms. Merleau-Ponty instead describes the nervous system as a\n\u201cfield of forces\u201d apportioned according to \u201cmodes of\npreferred distribution\u201d, a model inspired by Wolfgang\nK\u00f6hler\u2019s Gestalt physics (SC: 48/46). Both physiology and\nbehavior are \u201cforms\u201d, that is,\n\n\ntotal processes whose properties are not the sum of those which the\nisolated parts would possess\u2026. [T]here is form wherever the\nproperties of a system are modified by every change brought about in a\nsingle one of its parts and, on the contrary, are conserved when they\nall change while maintaining the same relationship among themselves.\n(SC: 49\u201350/47)\n\n\nForm or structure therefore describes dialectical, non-linear, and\ndynamic relationships that can function relatively autonomously and\nare irreducible to linear mechanical causality (see Thompson\n2007).\n\nThe critique of physiological atomism is also extended to theories of\nhigher behavior, such as Pavlov\u2019s theory of conditioned\nreflexes. Merleau-Ponty argues that such accounts rely on gratuitous\nhypotheses lacking experimental justification and cannot effectively\nexplain brain function or learning. In the case of brain function,\nexperimental work on brain damage demonstrates that localization\nhypotheses must be rejected in favor of a global process of neural\norganization comparable to the figure-ground structures of perceptual\norganization. Similarly, learning cannot be explained in terms of\ntrial-and-error fixing of habitual reactions, but instead involves a\ngeneral aptitude with respect to typical structures of situations.\nMerleau-Ponty proposes an alternative tripartite classification of\nbehavior according to the degree to which the structures toward which\nit is oriented emerge thematically from their content.\nSyncretic behaviors, typical of simpler organisms such as\nants or toads, respond to all stimuli as analogues of vital situations\nfor which the organism\u2019s responses are instinctually prescribed\nby its \u201cspecies a priori\u201d, with no possibility for\nadaptive learning or improvisation. Amovable behaviors are\noriented toward signals of varying complexity that are not a function\nof the organism\u2019s instinctual equipment and can lead to genuine\nlearning. Here the organism, guided by its vital norms, responds to\nsignals as relational structures rather than as objective properties\nof things. Drawing on K\u00f6hler\u2019s experimental work with\nchimpanzees, Merleau-Ponty argues that even intelligent non-human\nanimals lack an orientation toward objective things, which emerges\nonly at the level of symbolic behavior. While amovable\nbehavior remains attached to immediate functional structures, symbolic\nbehavior (here limited to humans) is open to virtual, expressive, and\nrecursive relationships across structures, making possible the human\norientation toward objectivity, truth, creativity, and freedom from\nbiologically determined norms.\n\nMore generally, Merleau-Ponty proposes that matter, life, and mind are\nincreasingly integrative levels of Gestalt structure, ontologically\ncontinuous but structurally discontinuous, and distinguished by the\ncharacteristic properties emergent at each integrative level of\ncomplexity. A form is defined here as\n\n\na field of forces characterized by a law which has no meaning outside\nthe limits of the dynamic structure considered, and which on the other\nhand assigns its properties to each internal point so much so that\nthey will never be absolute properties, properties of this\npoint. (SC: 148/137\u201338)\n\n\nMerleau-Ponty argues that this understanding extends to all physical\nlaws, which \u201cexpress a structure and have meaning only within\nthis structure\u201d; the laws of physics always refer back to\n\u201ca sensible or historical given\u201d and ultimately to the\nhistory of the universe (SC: 149/138, 157/145). At the level of life,\nform is characterized by a dialectical relation between the organism\nand its environment that is a function of the organism\u2019s vital\nnorms, its \u201coptimal conditions of activity and its proper manner\nof realizing equilibrium\u201d, which express its style or\n\u201cgeneral attitude toward the world\u201d (SC: 161/148). Living\nthings are not oriented toward an objective world but toward an\nenvironment that is organized meaningfully in terms of their\nindividual and specific style and vital goals.\n\nMind, the symbolic level of form that Merleau-Ponty identifies with\nthe human, is organized not toward vital goals but by the\ncharacteristic structures of the human world: tools, language,\nculture, and so on. These are not originally encountered as things or\nideas, but rather as \u201csignificative intentions\u201d embodied\nwithin the world. Mind or consciousness cannot be defined formally in\nterms of self-knowledge or representation, then, but is essentially\nengaged in the structures and actions of the human world and\nencompasses all of the diverse intentional orientations of human life.\nWhile mind integrates within itself the subordinate structures of\nmatter and life, it goes beyond these in its thematic orientation\ntoward structures as such, which is the condition for such\ncharacteristically human symbolic activities as language and\nexpression, the creation of new structures beyond those set by vital\nneeds, and the power of choosing and varying points of view (which\nmake truth and objectivity possible). In short, mind as a second-order\nor recursive structure is oriented toward the virtual rather than\nsimply toward the real. Ideally, the subordinate structure of life\nwould be fully absorbed into the higher order of mind in a fully\nintegrated human being; the biological would be transcended by the\n\u201cspiritual\u201d. But integration is never perfect or complete,\nand mind can never be detached from its moorings in a concrete and\nembodied situation.\n\nMerleau-Ponty emphasizes throughout The Structure of Behavior\nthat form, even though ontologically fundamental, cannot be accounted\nfor in the terms of traditional realism; since form is fundamentally\nperceptual, an \u201cimmanent signification\u201d, it retains an\nessential relationship with consciousness. But the \u201cperceptual\nconsciousness\u201d at stake here is not the transcendental\nconsciousness of critical philosophy. The last chapter of The\nStructure of Behavior clarifies this revised understanding of\nconsciousness in dialogue with the classical problem of the relation\nbetween the soul and the body in order to account for the relative\ntruths of both transcendental philosophy and naturalism. The issue\nconcerns how to reconcile the perspective of consciousness as\n\u201cuniversal milieu\u201d (i.e., transcendental consciousness)\nwith consciousness as \u201cenrooted in the subordinated\ndialectics\u201d, that is, as a Gestalt emerging from lower-order\nGestalts (i.e., perceptual consciousness) (SC: 199/184). In the\nnatural attitude of our pre-reflective lives, we are committed to the\nview that our perceptual experience of things is always situated and\nperspectival (i.e., that physical objects are presented through\n\u201cprofiles\u201d, Husserl\u2019s Abschattungen), but\nalso that we thereby experience things \u201cin themselves\u201d, as\nthey really are in the mind-independent world; the perspectival\ncharacter of our opening onto the world is not a limitation of our\naccess but rather the very condition of the world\u2019s disclosure\nin its inexhaustibility. At the level of this prereflective faith in\nthe world, there is no dilemma of the soul\u2019s separation from the\nbody; \u201cthe soul remains coextensive with nature\u201d (SC:\n203/189).\n\nThis prereflective unity eventually splinters under our awareness of\nillness, illusion, and anatomy, which teach us to separate nature,\nbody, and thought into distinct orders of events partes extra\npartes. This culminates in a naturalism that cannot account for\nthe originary situation of perception that it displaces, yet on which\nit tacitly relies; perception requires an \u201cinternal\u201d\nanalysis, paving the way for transcendental idealism\u2019s treatment\nof subject and object as \u201cinseparable correlatives\u201d (SC:\n215/199). But transcendental idealism in the critical tradition\nsubsequently goes too far: by taking consciousness as \u201cmilieu of\nthe universe, presupposed by every affirmation of the world\u201d, it\nobscures the original character of the perceptual relation and\nculminates in \u201cthe dialectic of the epistemological subject and\nthe scientific object\u201d (SC: 216/200, 217/201). Merleau-Ponty\naims to integrate the truth of naturalism and transcendental thought\nby reinterpreting both through the concept of structure, which\naccounts for the unity of soul and body as well as their relative\ndistinction. Against the conception of transcendental consciousness as\na pure spectator correlated with the world, Merleau-Ponty insists that\nmind is an accomplishment of structural integration that remains\nessentially conditioned by the matter and life in which it is\nembodied; the truth of naturalism lies in the fact that such\nintegration is essentially fragile and incomplete. Since\n\u201cintegration is never absolute and always fails\u201d, the\ndualism of mind and body\n\n\nis not a simple fact; it is founded in principle\u2014all integration\npresupposing the normal functioning of subordinated formations, which\nalways demand their own due. (SC: 226\u201327/210)\n\n\nThe Structure of Behavior concludes with a call for further\ninvestigation of \u201cperceptual consciousness\u201d, a task taken\nup by its sequel, Phenomenology of Perception. In the\nconcluding pages of Structure, Merleau-Ponty offers a\npreliminary sketch of phenomenologically inspired approaches to the\n\u201cproblem of perception\u201d that set the stage for his\nsubsequent work, emphasizing (a) the difference between what is\ndirectly given as an aspect of individual lived experience and\nintersubjective significations that are only encountered virtually;\nand (b) the distinctiveness of one\u2019s own body, which is never\nexperienced directly as one objective thing among many. The book\nconcludes by identifying the \u201cproblem of perception\u201d as\nits encompassing concern:\n\n\nCan one conceptualize perceptual consciousness without eliminating it\nas an original mode; can one maintain its specificity without\nrendering inconceivable its relation to intellectual consciousness?\n(SC: 241/224)\n\n\nThe solution requires a \u201creturn to perception as to a type of\noriginary experience\u201d by means of an \u201cinversion of the\nnatural movement of consciousness\u201d, an inversion that\nMerleau-Ponty here equates with Husserl\u2019s phenomenological\nreduction (SC: 236/220). If successful, this rehabilitation of the\nstatus of perception would lead to a redefinition of transcendental\nphilosophy \u201cin such a way as to integrate with it the very\nphenomenon of the real\u201d (SC: 241/224).\n3. Phenomenology of Perception\n\nCompleted in 1944 and published the following year, Phenomenology\nof Perception (PP) is the work for which Merleau-Ponty was best\nknown during his lifetime and that established him as the leading\nFrench phenomenologist of his generation. Here Merleau-Ponty develops\nhis own distinctive interpretation of phenomenology\u2019s method,\ninformed by his new familiarity with Husserl\u2019s unpublished\nmanuscripts and his deepened engagement with other thinkers in this\ntradition, such as Eugen Fink and Martin Heidegger. Phenomenology\nof Perception again draws extensively on Gestalt theory and\ncontemporary research in psychology and neurology; the case of\nSchneider, a brain-damaged patient studied by Adh\u00e9mar Gelb and\nKurt Goldstein, serves as an extended case-study. Psychological\nresearch complements and, at times, serves as a counterpoint to\nphenomenological descriptions of perceptual experience across a wide\nrange of existential dimensions, including sexuality, language, space,\nnature, intersubjectivity, time, and freedom. In\nPhenomenology, Merleau-Ponty develops a characteristic rhythm\nof presenting, first, the realist or empiricist approach to a\nparticular dimension of experience, followed then by its idealist or\nintellectualist alternative, before developing a third way that avoids\nthe problematic assumption common to both, namely, their\n\u201cunquestioned belief in the world\u201d: the prejudice that the\nobjective world exists as a ready-made and fully present reality.\n\nThe Preface to Phenomenology of Perception, completed after\nthe main text, offers Merleau-Ponty\u2019s most detailed and\nsystematic exposition of the phenomenological method. His account is\norganized around four themes: the privileging of description over\nscientific explanation or idealist reconstruction, the\nphenomenological reduction, the eidetic reduction, and intentionality.\nIn order to describe faithfully our pre-reflective engagement with the\nworld, phenomenology first sets aside all scientific or naturalistic\nexplanations of phenomena. Such explanations attempt to reconstruct\nthe experience of the world, which they inevitably presuppose, by\nmeans of causal mechanisms. In parallel, phenomenology also avoids\nreconstructing actual experience in idealist terms, that is, by its\nconditions of possibility or the activity of consciousness. The\n\u201creflective analysis\u201d employed by Descartes and Kant, for\ninstance, by replacing the world with the synthesizing acts of\nconsciousness, thereby obscures the fact that the world exists prior\nto any conscious act or judgment. Rather than reconstructing the world\nin terms of the conditions of possible experience,\nphenomenology must explore the conditions of actual\nexperience, which are not reducible to conscious judgments or\nrepresentations. Consequently, the phenomenological reduction, on\nMerleau-Ponty's interpretation, is neither a naturalistic nor an\nidealist method but an existential one, namely, the reflective effort\nto describe our pre-reflective engagement with the world without\nreducing this engagement either to causal events or to conscious acts.\nThrough the process of the reduction, we discover the inherence of the\none who reflects in the world that is reflected on, and consequently,\nthe essentially incomplete character of every act of reflection, which\nis why Merleau-Ponty claims that the \u201cmost important lesson of\nthe reduction is the impossibility of a complete reduction\u201d (PP:\n14/lxxvii). Similarly, the \u201ceidetic reduction\u201d, described\nby Husserl as the intuition of essential relations within the flux of\nconscious experience, is necessary if phenomenology is to make any\ndescriptive claims that go beyond the brute facts of a particular\nexperience. But this does not found the actual world on consciousness\nas the condition of the world\u2019s possibility; instead, \u201cthe\neidetic method is that of a phenomenological positivism grounding the\npossible upon the real\u201d (PP: 17/lxxxi). Lastly, Merleau-Ponty\nreinterprets the phenomenological concept of intentionality,\ntraditionally understood as the recognition that all consciousness is\nconsciousness of something. Following Husserl, he\ndistinguishes the \u201cact intentionality\u201d of judgments and\nvoluntary decisions from the \u201coperative intentionality\u201d\nthat \u201cestablishes the natural and pre-predicative unity of the\nworld and of our life\u201d (PP: 18/lxxxii). Guided by this broader\nconcept of intentionality, philosophy\u2019s task is to take in the\n\u201ctotal intention\u201d of a sensible thing, a philosophical\ntheory, or an historical event, which is its \u201cunique manner of\nexisting\u201d or its \u201cexistential structure\u201d (PP:\n19\u201320/lxxxii\u2013lxxxiii). Phenomenology thereby expresses the\nemergence of reason and meaning in a contingent world, a creative task\ncomparable to that of the artist or the political activist, which\nrequires an ongoing \u201cradical\u201d or self-referential\nreflection on its own possibilities. On Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\npresentation, the tensions of phenomenology\u2019s method therefore\nreflect the nature of its task:\n\n\nThe unfinished nature of phenomenology and the inchoative style in\nwhich it proceeds are not the sign of failure, they were inevitable\nbecause phenomenology\u2019s task was to reveal the mystery of the\nworld and the mystery of reason. (PP: 21\u201322/lxxxv)\n\n\nPhenomenology of Perception introduces its primary inquiry\nwith a critique of the \u201cclassical prejudices\u201d of\nempiricism and intellectualism. Merleau-Ponty rejects the empiricist\nunderstanding of sensation, with its correlative \u201cconstancy\nhypothesis\u201d, and the role empiricism grants to association and\nthe projection of memory for treating the basic units of sensation as\ndeterminate atoms rather than as meaningful wholes. These wholes\ninclude ambiguities, indeterminacies, and contextual relations that\ndefy explanation in terms of the causal action of determinate things.\nIntellectualism aims to provide an alternative to empiricism by\nintroducing judgment or attention as mental activities that synthesize\nexperience from the sensory givens, yet it adopts empiricism\u2019s\nstarting point in dispersed, atomic sensations. Both approaches are\nguilty of reading the results of perception (the objective world) back\ninto perceptual experience, thereby falsifying perception\u2019s\ncharacteristic structure: the spontaneous organization or\nconfiguration of perceived phenomena themselves, with their\nindeterminacies and ambiguities, and the dynamic character of\nperception as an historical process involving development and\ntransformation. By treating perception as a causal process of\ntransmission or a cognitive judgment, empiricism and intellectualism\ndeny any meaningful configuration to the perceived as such and treat\nall values and meanings as projections, leaving no basis in perception\nitself for distinguishing the true from the illusory.\n\nIn contrast, Merleau-Ponty argues that the basic level of perceptual\nexperience is the gestalt, the meaningful whole of figure against\nground, and that the indeterminate and contextual aspects of the\nperceived world are positive phenomenon that cannot be eliminated from\na complete account. Sensing, in distinction from knowing, is a\n\u201cliving communication with the world that makes it present to us\nas the familiar place of our life\u201d (PP: 79/53), investing the\nperceived world with meanings and values that refer essentially to our\nbodies and lives. We fail to notive this \u201cphenomenal\nfield\u201d, the world as it appears directly to perception, as a\nconsequence of perception\u2019s own tendency to forget itself in\nfavor of the perceived that it discloses. Perception orients itself\ntoward the truth, placing its faith in the eventual convergence of\nperspectives and progressive determination of what was previously\nindeterminate. But it thereby naturally projects a completed and\ninvariant \u201ctruth in itself\u201d as its goal. Science extends\nand amplifies this natural tendency through increasingly precise\nmeasurements of the invariants in perception, leading eventually to\nthe theoretical construction of an objective world of determinate\nthings. Once this determinism of the \u201cin itself\u201d is\nextended universally and applied even to the body and the perceptual\nrelation itself, then its ongoing dependence on the \u201coriginary\nfaith\u201d of perception is obscured; perception is reduced to\n\u201cconfused appearances\u201d that require methodical\nreinterpretation, and the eventual result is dualism, solipsism, and\nskepticism. The \u201cfundamental philosophical act\u201d would\ntherefore be to \u201creturn to the lived world beneath the objective\nworld\u201d (PP: 83/57). This requires a transcendental reduction: a\nreversal of perception\u2019s natural tendency to cover its own\ntracks and a bracketing of our unquestioned belief in the objective\nworld. Yet this cannot be a recourse to any transcendental\nconsciousness that looks on the world from outside and is not itself\nemergent from and conditioned by the phenomenal field. Rather than a\ntranscendental ego, Merleau-Ponty speaks of a \u201ctranscendental\nfield\u201d, emphasizing that reflection always has a situated and\npartial perspective as a consequence of being located within the field\non which it reflects.\n\nThe first of the three major parts of Phenomenology concerns\nthe body. As we have seen, perception transcends itself toward a\ndeterminate object \u201cin itself\u201d, culminating in an\nobjective interpretation of the body. Part One shows the limits of\nthis objective account and sketches an alternative understanding of\nthe body across a series of domains, including the experience of\none\u2019s own body, lived space, sexuality, and language. Through a\ncontrast with pathological cases such as phantom limbs, Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes the body\u2019s typical mode of existence as\n\u201cbeing-toward-the-world\u201d\u2014a pre-objective orientation\ntoward a vital situation that is explicable neither in terms of\nthird-person causal interactions nor by explicit judgments or\nrepresentations. The body\u2019s orientation toward the world is\nessentially temporal, involving a dialectic between the present body\n(characterized, after Husserl, as an \u201cI can\u201d) and the\nhabit body, the sedimentations of past activities that take on a\ngeneral, anonymous, and autonomous character. While the body\u2019s\nrelation to the world serves as the essential background for the\nexperience of any particular thing, the body itself is experienced in\nways that distinguish it in kind from all other things: it is a\npermanent part of one\u2019s perceptual field, even though one cannot\nin principle experience all of it directly; it has \u201cdouble\nsensations\u201d, such as when one hand touches another, that enact a\nform of reflexivity; it has affective experiences that are not merely\nrepresentations; and its kinesthetic sense of its own movements is\ngiven directly.\n\nThis kinesthetic awareness is made possible by a pre-conscious system\nof bodily movements and spatial equivalences that Merleau-Ponty terms\nthe \u201cbody schema\u201d. In contrast with the \u201cpositional\nspatiality\u201d of things, the body has a \u201csituational\nspatiality\u201d that is oriented toward actual or possible tasks\n(PP: 129/102). The body\u2019s existence as\n\u201cbeing-toward-the-world\u201d, as a projection toward lived\ngoals, is therefore expressed through its spatiality, which forms the\nbackground against which objective space is constituted. Merleau-Ponty\nintroduces here the famous case of Schneider, whose reliance on\npathological substitutions for normal spatial abilities helps to bring\nthe body\u2019s typical relationship with lived space to light.\nSchneider lacks the ability to \u201cproject\u201d into virtual\nspace; more generally, his injury has disrupted the \u201cintentional\narc\u201d that\n\n\nprojects around us our past, our future, our human milieu, our\nphysical situation, our ideological situation, and our moral\nsituation, or rather, that ensures that we are situated within all of\nthese relationships. (PP: 170/137)\n\n\nThe body\u2019s relationship with space is therefore intentional,\nalthough as an \u201cI can\u201d rather than an \u201cI\nthink\u201d; bodily space is a multi-layered manner of relating to\nthings, so that the body is not \u201cin\u201d space but lives or\ninhabits it.\n\nJust as bodily space reflects an originary form of\nintentionality\u2014a pre-cognitive encounter with the world as\nmeaningfully structured\u2014the same is shown to be the case for\nsexuality and for language. Sexuality takes on a special significance\nbecause it essentially expresses the metaphysical drama of the human\ncondition while infusing the atmosphere of our lives with sexual\nsignificance. Like space and sexuality, speech is also a form of\nbodily expression. Language does not initially encode ready-made\nthoughts but rather expresses through its style or physiognomy as a\nbodily gesture. We mistake language for a determined code by taking\nhabitual or sedimented language as our model, thereby missing\n\u201cauthentic\u201d or creative speech. Since language, like\nperception, hides its own operations in carrying us toward its\nmeaning, it offers an ideal of truth as its presumptive limit,\ninspiring our traditional privileging of thought or reason as\ndetachable from all materiality. But, at a fundamental level, language\nis comparable to music in the way that it remains tied to its material\nembodiment; each language is a distinct and ultimately untranslatable\nmanner of \u201csinging the world\u201d, of extracting and\nexpressing the \u201cemotional essence\u201d of our surroundings and\nrelationships (PP: 228/193).\n\nHaving rediscovered the body as expressive and intentional,\nMerleau-Ponty turns in Part Two of Phenomenology to the\nperceived world, with the aim of showing how the pre-reflective unity\nof co-existence that characterizes the body has as its correlate the\nsynthesis of things and the world; \u201cOne\u2019s own body is in\nthe world just as the heart is in the organism\u201d (PP: 245/209),\nand its expressive unity therefore also extends to the sensible world.\nMerleau-Ponty develops this interpretation of the sensible through\ndetailed studies of sensing, space, and the natural and social worlds.\nSensing takes place as the \u201cco-existence\u201d or\n\u201ccommunion\u201d of the body with the world that Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes as a reciprocal exchange of question and answer:\n\n\na sensible that is about to be sensed poses to my body a sort of\nconfused problem. I must find the attitude that will provide\nit with the means to become determinate \u2026 I must find the\nresponse to a poorly formulated question. And yet I only do this in\nresponse to its solicitation\u2026 . The sensible gives back to me\nwhat I had lent to it, but I received it from the sensible in the\nfirst place. (PP: 259/222)\n\n\nAs co-existence, sensing is characterized by an intentionality that\nsympathetically attunes itself to the sensed according to a dialectic\nin which both terms\u2014the perceiving body and the perceived\nthing\u2014are equally active and receptive: the thing invites the\nbody to adopt the attitude that will lead to its disclosure. Since the\nsubject of this perception is not the idealist\u2019s \u201cfor\nitself\u201d, neither is the object of perception the realist\u2019s\n\u201cin itself\u201d; rather, the agent of perception is the\npre-reflective and anonymous subjectivity of the body, which remains\nenmeshed in and \u201cconnatural\u201d with the world that it\nperceives. The senses are unified without losing their distinctness in\na fashion comparable to the binocular synthesis of vision, and their\nanonymity is a consequence of the \u201chistorical thickness\u201d\nof perception as a tradition that operates beneath the level of\nreflective consciousness (PP: 285/248). For first-person awareness,\none\u2019s anonymous perceptual engagement with the world operates as\na kind of \u201coriginal past, a past that has never been\npresent\u201d (PP: 252/252).\n\nThe pre-historical pact between the body and the world informs our\nencounters with space, revealing a synthesis of space that is neither\n\u201cspatialized\u201d (as a pre-given container in which things\nare arranged) nor \u201cspatializing\u201d (like the homogenous and\ninterchangeable relations of geometrical space). Drawing on\npsychological experiments concerning bodily orientation, depth, and\nmovement, Merleau-Ponty argues that empiricist and intellectualist\naccounts of space must give way to a conception of space as\nco-existence or mutual implication characterized by existential\n\u201clevels\u201d: our orientation toward up and down, or toward\nwhat is in motion or stationary, is a function of the body\u2019s\nadoption of a certain level within a revisable field of possibilities.\nLived inherence in space contrasts with the abstract space of the\nanalytical attitude, revindicating the existential space of night,\ndreams, or myths in relation to the abstract space of the\n\u201cobjective\u201d world.\n\nThe properties of things that we take to be \u201creal\u201d and\n\u201cobjective\u201d also tacitly assume a reference to the\nbody\u2019s norms and its adoption of levels. An object\u2019s\n\u201ctrue\u201d qualities depend on the body\u2019s privileging of\norientations that yield maximum clarity and richness. This is possible\nbecause the body serves as a template for the style or logic of the\nworld, the concordant system of relations that links the qualities of\nan object, the configuration of the perceptual field, and background\nlevels such as lighting or movement. In this symbiosis or\ncall-and-response between the body and the world, things have sense as\nthe correlates of one\u2019s body, and reality therefore always\ninvolves a reference to perception. Yet, to be real, things cannot be\nreducible to correlates of the body or perception; they retain a depth\nand resistance that provides their existential index. While each thing\nhas its individual style, the world is the ultimate horizon or\nbackground style against which any particular thing can appear. The\nperspectival limitations of perception, both spatially and temporally,\nare the obverse of this world\u2019s depth and inexhaustibility.\nThrough an examination of hallucination and illusions, Merleau-Ponty\nargues that skepticism about the existence of the world makes a\ncategory mistake. While we can doubt any particular perception,\nillusions can appear only against the background of the world and our\nprimordial faith in it. While we never coincide with the world or\ngrasp it with absolute certainty, we are also never entirely cut off\nfrom it; perception essentially aims toward truth, but any truth that\nit reveals is contingent and revisable.\n\nRejecting analogical explanations for the experience of other people,\nMerleau-Ponty proposes that the rediscovery of the body as a\n\u201cthird genre of being between the pure subject and the\nobject\u201d makes possible encounters with embodied others (PP:\n407/366). We perceive others directly as pre-personal and embodied\nliving beings engaged with a world that we share in common. This\nencounter at the level of anonymous and pre-personal lives does not,\nhowever, present us with another person in the full sense, since our\nsituations are never entirely congruent. The perception of others\ninvolves an alterity, a resistance, and a plenitude that are never\nreducible to what is presented, which is the truth of solipsism. Our\ncommon corporeality nevertheless opens us onto a shared social world,\na permanent dimension of our being in the mode of the anonymous and\ngeneral \u201csomeone\u201d. The perception of others is therefore a\nprivileged example of the paradox of transcendence running through our\nencounter with the world as perceived:\n\n\nWhether it is a question of my body, the natural world, the past,\nbirth or death, the question is always to know how I can be open to\nphenomena that transcend me and that, nevertheless, only exist to the\nextent that I take them up and live them. (PP: 422/381)\n\n\nThis \u201cfundamental contradiction\u201d defines our encounters\nwith every form of transcendence and requires new conceptions of\nconsciousness, time, and freedom.\n\nThe fourth and final section of Phenomenology explores these\nthree themes, starting with a revision of the concept of the cogito\nthat avoids reducing it to merely episodic psychological fact or\nelevating it to a universal certainty of myself and my\ncogitationes. Merleau-Ponty argues that we cannot separate\nthe certainty of our thoughts from that of our perceptions, since to\ntruly perceive is to have confidence in the veracity of one\u2019s\nperceptions. Furthermore, we are not transparent to ourselves, since\nour \u201cinner states\u201d are available to us only in a situated\nand ambiguous way. The genuine cogito, Merleau-Ponty argues, is a\ncogito \u201cin action\u201d: we do not deduce \u201cI am\u201d\nfrom \u201cI think\u201d, but rather the certainty of \u201cI\nthink\u201d rests on the \u201cI am\u201d of existential\nengagement. More basic than explicit self-consciousness and\npresupposed by it is an ambiguous mode of self-experience that\nMerleau-Ponty terms the silent or \u201ctacit\u201d cogito\u2014our\npre-reflective and inarticulate grasp on the world and ourselves that\nbecomes explicit and determinate only when it finds expression for\nitself. The illusions of pure self-possession and\ntransparency\u2014like all apparently \u201ceternal\u201d\ntruths\u2014are the results of acquired or sedimented language and\nconcepts.\n\nRejecting classic approaches to time that treat it either as an\nobjective property of things, as a psychological content, or as the\nproduct of transcendental consciousness, Merleau-Ponty returns to the\n\u201cfield of presence\u201d as our foundational experience of\ntime. This field is a network of intentional relations, of\n\u201cprotentions\u201d and \u201cretentions\u201d, in a single\nmovement of dehiscence or self-differentiation, such that \u201ceach\npresent reaffirms the presence of the entire past that it drives away,\nand anticipates the presence of the entire future or the\n\u2018to-come\u2019\u201d (PP: 483/444). Time in this sense is\n\u201cultimate subjectivity\u201d, understood not as an eternal\nconsciousness, but rather as the very act of temporalization. As with\nthe tacit cogito, the auto-affection of time as ultimate subjectivity\nis not a static self-identity but involves a dynamic opening toward\nalterity. In this conception of time as field of presence, which\n\u201creveals the subject and the object as two abstract moments of a\nunique structure, namely, presence\u201d (PP:\n494/454\u201355), Merleau-Ponty sees the resolution to all problems\nof transcendence as well as the foundation for human freedom. Against\nthe Sartrean position that freedom is either total or null,\nMerleau-Ponty holds that freedom emerges only against the background\nof our \u201cuniversal engagement in a world\u201d, which involves\nus in meanings and values that are not of our choosing. We must\nrecognize, first, an \u201cauthochthonous sense of the world that is\nconstituted in the exchange between the world and our embodied\nexistence\u201d (PP: 504/466), and, second, that the acquired habits\nand the sedimented choices of our lives have their own inertia. This\nsituation does not eliminate freedom but is precisely the field in\nwhich it can be achieved. Taking class consciousness as his example,\nMerleau-Ponty proposes that this dialectic of freedom and acquisition\nprovides the terms for an account of history, according to which\nhistory can develop a meaning and a direction that are neither\ndetermined by events nor necessarily transparent to those who live\nthrough it.\n4. Expression, Language, and Art\n\nThe concepts of expression and style are central to\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s thought and already play a key role in his first\ntwo books, where they characterize the perceptual exchange between an\norganism and its milieu, the body\u2019s sensible dialogue with the\nworld, and even the act of philosophical reflection (see Landes 2013).\nIn both works, Merleau-Ponty draws on a range of literary and artistic\nexamples to describe the creative and expressive dimensions of\nperception and reflection, emphasizing in particular the parallels\nbetween the task of the artist and that of the thinker: as the\nconcluding lines of the Preface to Phenomenology of\nPerception note,\n\n\nPhenomenology is as painstaking as the works of Balzac, Proust,\nVal\u00e9ry, or C\u00e9zanne\u2014through the same kind of\nattention and wonder, the same demand for awareness, the same will to\ngrasp the sense of the world or of history in its nascent state. (PP:\n22/lxxxv)\n\n\nExpression, particularly in language and the arts, plays an\nincreasingly central role in Merleau-Ponty\u2019s thought in the\nyears following Phenomenology, when he aimed to formulate a\ngeneral theory of expression as the grounding for a philosophy of\nhistory and culture. This interest is first reflected in a series of\nessays addressing painting, literature, and film published in the\nyears immediately following Phenomenology (in Merleau-Ponty\n1996b/1964). These include Merleau-Ponty\u2019s first essay on\npainting, \u201cC\u00e9zanne\u2019s Doubt\u201d, which finds in\nC\u00e9zanne a proto-phenomenological effort to capture the birth of\nperception through painting. C\u00e9zanne epitomizes the paradoxical\nstruggle of creative expression, which necessarily relies on the\nidiosyncracies of the artist\u2019s individual history and\npsychology, as well as the resources of the tradition of painting, but\ncan succeed only by risking a creative appropriation of these\nacquisitions in the service of teaching its audience to see the world\nanew. Similarly, Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s artistic productivity is\nexplicable neither in terms of his intellectual freedom\n(Val\u00e9ry) nor his childhood (Freud) but as the dialectic of\nspontaneity and sedimentation by which Merleau-Ponty had formerly\ndefined history.\n\nIn 1951, Merleau-Ponty summarizes his research after\nPhenomenology as focused on a \u201ctheory of truth\u201d\nexploring how knowledge and communication with others are\n\u201coriginal formations with respect to perceptual life, but\n\u2026 also preserve and continue our perceptual life even while\ntransforming it\u201d (UMP: 41\u201342/287). Expression, language,\nand symbolism are the key to this theory of truth and provide the\nfoundation for a philosophy of history and of\n\u201ctranscendental\u201d humanity. Whereas the study of perception\ncould only provide a \u201cbad ambiguity\u201d that mixes\n\u201cfinitude and universality\u201d, Merleau-Ponty sees in the\nphenomenon of expression a \u201cgood ambiguity\u201d that\n\u201cgathers together the plurality of monads, the past and the\npresent, nature and culture, into a single whole\u201d (UMP: 48/290).\nMany of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s courses from 1947 through 1953 at the\nUniversity of Lyon, the Sorbonne, and the Coll\u00e8ge de France\nfocus on language, expression, and\n literature.[6]\n\nThe manuscript partially completed during these years and published\nposthumously as The Prose of the World (1969/1973) pursues\nthese themes through a phenomenological investigation of literary\nlanguage and its relationship with scientific language and painting.\nCritiquing our commonsense ideal of a pure language that would\ntransparently encode pre-existing thoughts, Merleau-Ponty argues that\ninstituted language\u2014the conventional system of language as an\nestablished set of meanings and rules\u2014is derivative from a more\nprimordial function of language as genuinely creative, expressive, and\ncommunicative. Here he draws two insights from Saussurian linguistics:\nFirst, signs function diacritically, through their lateral relations\nand differentiations, rather than through a one-to-one correspondence\nwith a conventionally established meaning. Ultimately, signification\nhappens through the differences between terms in a referential system\nthat lacks any fixed or positive terms. This insight into diacritical\ndifference will later prove important to Merleau-Ponty\u2019s\nunderstanding of perception and ontology as well (see Alloa 2013a).\nSecond, the ultimate context for the operation of language is\neffective communication with others, by which new thoughts can be\nexpressed and meanings shared. Expression accomplishes itself through\na coherent reorganization of the relationships between acquired signs\nthat must teach itself to the reader or listener, and which may\nafterwards again sediment into a taken-for-granted institutional\nstructure.\n\nIn a long extract from the manuscript that was revised and published\nin 1952 as \u201cIndirect Language and the Voices of Silence\u201d\n(in Merleau-Ponty 1960/1964), Merleau-Ponty brings this understanding\nof language into conversation with Sartre\u2019s What is\nLiterature? and Andr\u00e9 Malraux\u2019s The Voices of\nSilence. Sharing Malraux\u2019s criticisms of the museum\u2019s\nrole in framing the reception of painting, but rejecting his\ninterpretation of modern painting as subjectivist, Merleau-Ponty\noffers an alternative understanding of \u201cinstitution\u201d (from\nHusserl\u2019s Stiftung) as the creative establishment of a\nnew field of meaning that opens an historical development. The style\nof an artist is not merely subjective but lived as a historical\ntrajectory of expression that begins with perception itself and\neffects a \u201ccoherent deformation\u201d in inherited traditions.\nRather than opposed as silent and speaking, painting and language are\nboth continuations of the expressivity of a perceptual style into more\nmalleable mediums. The unfinished character of modern painting is\ntherefore not a turn from the objectivity of representation toward\nsubjective creation but rather a more authentic testament to the\nparadoxical logic of all expression.\n\nMerleau-Ponty returns to the analysis of painting in his final essay,\n\u201cEye and Mind\u201d (1964a OEE), where he accords it an\nontological priority\u2014between the linguistic arts and\nmusic\u2014for revealing the \u201cthere is\u201d of the world that\nthe operationalism of contemporary science has occluded. It is by\n\u201clending his body to the world that the artist changes the world\ninto paintings\u201d (OEE: 16/353), and this presupposes that the\nartist\u2019s body is immersed in and made of the same stuff as the\nworld: to touch, one must be tangible, and to see, visible.\nMerleau-Ponty describes this as an \u201cintertwining\u201d or\n\u201coverlapping\u201d, in which the artist\u2019s situated\nembodiment is the other side of its opening to the world. There is as\nyet no sharp division between the sensing and the sensed, between body\nand things as one common \u201cflesh\u201d, and painting arises as\nthe expression of this relation: it is a \u201cvisible to the second\npower, a carnal essence or icon\u201d of embodied vision (OEE:\n22/355). Descartes\u2019s efforts, in the Optics, to\nreconstruct vision from thought leads him to focus on the\n\u201cenvelope\u201d or form of the object, as presented in engraved\nlines, and to treat depth as a third dimension modeled after height\nand width. This idealization of space has its necessity, yet, once\nelevated to a metaphysical status by contemporary science, it\nculminates in an understanding of being as purely positive and\nabsolutely determinate. The ontological significance of modern\npainting and the plastic arts\u2014e.g., Klee, de Sta\u00ebl,\nC\u00e9zanne, Matisse, Rodin\u2014lies in the alternative\nphilosophy that they embody, as revealed through their treatment of\ndepth, color, line, and movement. Ultimately, such works teach us anew\nwhat it means to see:\n\n\nVision is not a certain mode of thought or presence to self; it is the\nmeans given me for being absent from myself, for being present from\nthe inside at the fission of Being only at the end of which do I close\nup into myself. (OEE: 81/374)\n\n5. Political Philosophy\n\nFrom the first issue of Les Temps Modernes in October 1945\nuntil his death, Merleau-Ponty wrote regularly on politics, including\nreflections on contemporary events as well as explorations of their\nphilosophical underpinnings and the broader political significance of\nhis times. During his eight-year tenure as unofficial managing editor\nof Les Temps Modernes, he charted the review\u2019s\npolitical direction and penned many of its political\n editorials.[7]\n After leaving Les Temps Modernes in 1953, Merleau-Ponty\nfound new outlets for his political writings, including\nL\u2019Express, a weekly newspaper devoted to the\nnon-communist left. Both of the essay collections that he published\nduring his lifetime, Sense and Non-Sense and Signs,\ndevote significant space to his political writings. He also published\ntwo volumes devoted entirely to political philosophy, Humanism and\nTerror (HT) and Adventures of the Dialectic (1955 AdD).\nAlways writing from the left, Merleau-Ponty\u2019s position gradually\nshifted from a qualified Marxism, maintaining a critical distance from\nliberal democracy as well as from Soviet communism, to the rejection\nof revolutionary politics in favor of a \u201cnew liberalism\u201d.\nHis political writings have received relatively scant attention\ncompared with other aspects of his philosophy, perhaps because of\ntheir close engagement with the political situations and events of his\nday. Nevertheless, scholars of his political thought emphasize its\ncontinuity with his theoretical writings and ongoing relevance for\npolitical philosophy (see Coole 2007; Whiteside 1998; Smyth 2014;\nMelan\u00e7on 2021).\n\nThe 1947 publication of Humanism and Terror responded to\ngrowing anti-communist sentiment in France fueled in part by the\nfictional account of the Moscow trials in Arthur Koestler\u2019s\npopular novel Darkness at Noon. Merleau-Ponty sought to\narticulate an alternative to the choice Europe apparently faced in the\nsolidifying opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union.\nHumanism and Terror criticizes Koestler\u2019s portrayal of\nthe fictional Rubochov, modeled on Nikolai Bukharin, for replacing the\n\u201cmutual praxis\u201d of genuine Marxism (HT: 102/18)\nwith an opposition between pure freedom and determined history, the\n\u201cyogi\u201d who withdraws into spiritual ideals or the\n\u201ccommissar\u201d who acts by any means necessary. Turning to an\nexamination of Bukharin\u2019s 1938 trial, Merleau-Ponty finds there\nan example of \u201crevolutionary justice\u201d that \u201cjudges\nin the name of the Truth that the Revolution is about to make\ntrue\u201d (HT: 114/28), even though the historical contingency that\nthis entails is denied by the procedures of the trials themselves. On\nthe other hand, Trotsky\u2019s condemnation of Stalinism as\ncounter-revolutionary similarly misses the ambiguity of genuine\nhistory. Ultimately, the dimension of terror that history harbors is a\nconsequence of our unavoidable responsibility in the face of its\nessential contingency and ambiguity.\n\nAlthough violence is a consequence of the human condition and\ntherefore the starting point for politics, Merleau-Ponty finds hope in\nthe theory of the proletariat for a fundamental transformation in the\nterms of human recognition:\n\n\nThe proletariat is universal de facto, or manifestly in its\nvery condition of life\u2026. [I]t is the sole authentic\nintersubjectivity because it alone lives simultaneously the separation\nand union of individuals. (HT: 221/116\u201317)\n\n\nA genuinely historical Marxism must recognize that nothing guarantees\nprogress toward a classless society, but also that this end cannot be\nbrought about by non-proletarian means, which is what Soviet communism\nhad apparently forgotten. Despite the failures of the Soviet\nexperiment, Merleau-Ponty remains committed to a humanist Marxism:\n\n\nMarxism is not just any hypothesis that might be replaced tomorrow by\nsome other. It is the simple statement of those conditions without\nwhich there would be neither any humanism, in the sense of a mutual\nrelation between men, nor any rationality in history. In this sense\nMarxism is not a philosophy of history; it is the philosophy\nof history and to renounce it is to dig the grave of Reason in\nhistory. (HT: 266/153)\n\n\nEven if the proletariat is not presently leading world history, its\ntime may yet come. Merleau-Ponty therefore concludes with a\n\u201cwait-and-see\u201d Marxism that cautions against\ndecontextualized criticisms of Soviet communism as well as apologetics\nfor liberal democracies that whitewash their racist and colonial\nviolence.\n\nRevelations about the Gulag camps and the outbreak of the Korean War\nforced Merleau-Ponty to revise his position on Marxism and\nrevolutionary politics, culminating in the 1955 Adventures of the\nDialectic (AdD). The book begins with the formulation of a\ngeneral theory of history in conversation with Max Weber. Historians\nnecessarily approach the past through their own perspectives, but,\nsince they are themselves a part of history\u2019s movement, this\nneed not compromise their objectivity. The historical events and\nperiods within which the historian traces a particular style or\nmeaning emerge in conjunction with historical agents, political actors\nor classes, who exercise a creative action parallel to the expressive\ngesture of the artist or the writer. History may eliminate false\npaths, but it guarantees no particular direction, leaving to\nhistorical agents the responsibility for the continuation or\ntransformation of what is inherited from the past through a genius for\ninventing what the times demand: \u201cIn politics, truth is perhaps\nonly this art of inventing what will later appear to have been\nrequired by the time\u201d (AdD: 42/29). Merleau-Ponty finds a\nsimilar position articulated by the young Georg Lukacs, for whom\n\u201cThere is only one knowledge, which is the knowledge of our\nworld in a state of becoming, and this becoming embraces knowledge\nitself\u201d (AdD: 46/32). History forms a third order, beyond\nsubjects and objects, of interhuman relations inscribed in cultural\nobjects and institutions, and with its own logic of sedimentation and\nspontaneity. The self-consciousness that emerges within this third\norder is precisely the proletariat, whose consciousness is not that of\nan \u201cI think\u201d but rather the praxis of their common\nsituation and system of action. Historical truth emerges from the\nmovement of creative expression whereby the Party brings the life of\nthe proletariat to explicit awareness, which requires, in return, that\nthe working class recognize and understand itself in the Party\u2019s\nformulations.\n\nWith this understanding, Lukacs aims to preserve the dialectic of\nhistory, to prevent it from slipping into a simple materialism, and\nthereby to discover the absolute in the relative. But Lukacs\nbacktracks on this position after its official rejection by the\ncommunist establishment in favor of a metaphysical materialism, and\nMerleau-Ponty finds a parallel in Marx\u2019s own turn away from\ngenuine dialectic toward a simple naturalism that justifies any action\nin the name of a historical necessity inscribed in things. For the\nlack of a genuine concept of institution that can recognize dialectic\nin embodied form, Marxist materialism repeatedly abandons its\ndialectical aspirations, as Merleau-Ponty further illustrates through\nthe example of Trostky\u2019s career.\n\nIn the final chapter of Adventures, Merleau-Ponty turns his\nsights toward Sartre\u2019s endorsement of communism in The\nCommunists and Peace. On Merleau-Ponty\u2019s interpretation,\nSartre\u2019s ontological commitment to a dualism of being and\nnothingness, where the full positivity of determinate things\njuxtaposes with the negating freedom of consciousness, eliminates any\nmiddle ground for history or praxis. Since consciousness is\nunconstrained by any sedimentation or by the autonomous life of\ncultural acquisitions, it can recognize no inertia or spontaneity at\nthe level of institutions, and therefore no genuine historical\nbecoming. More centrally, by interpreting the relation between the\nParty and the proletariat through his own conception of consciousness\nas pure freedom, Sartre rules out in principle any possibility for\ntheir divergence. This leads Sartre to an\n\u201cultrabolshevism\u201d according to which the Party\u2019s\nposition is identified with the revolutionary agenda, any opposition\nto which must be suppressed.\n\nIn the Epilogue that summarizes Merleau-Ponty\u2019s own position, he\nexplains his rejection of revolutionary action, understood as\nproletarian praxis, for remaining equivocal rather than truly\ndialectical. The illusion that has brought dialectic to a halt is\nprecisely the investment of history\u2019s total meaning in the\nproletariat, ultimately equating the proletariat with dialectic as\nsuch, which leads to the conviction that revolution would liquidate\nhistory itself. But it is essential to the very structure of\nrevolutions that, when successful, they betray their own revolutionary\ncharacter by sedimenting into institutions. Drawing on the extended\nexample of the French revolution, Merleau-Ponty argues that every\nrevolution mistakes the structure of history for its contents,\nbelieving that eliminating the latter will absolutely transform the\nformer. Thus, \u201cThe very nature of revolution is to believe\nitself absolute and to not be absolute precisely because it believes\nitself to be so\u201d (AdD: 298/222). While Soviet communism may\ncontinue to justify itself in absolute terms, it is concretely a\nprogressivism that tacitly recognizes the relativity of revolution and\nthe gradual nature of progress. The alternative that Merleau-Ponty\nendorses is the development of a \u201cnoncommunist left\u201d, an\n\u201ca-communism\u201d, or a \u201cnew liberalism\u201d, the\nfirst commitment of which would be to reject the description of the\nrivalry between the two powers as one between \u201cfree\nenterprise\u201d and Marxism (AdD: 302\u20133/225). This\nnoncommunist left would occupy a \u201cdouble position\u201d,\n\u201cposing social problems in terms of [class] struggle\u201d\nwhile also \u201crefusing the dictatorship of the proletariat\u201d\n(AdD: 304/226). This pursuit must welcome the resources of\nparliamentary debate, in clear recognition of their limitations, since\nParliament is \u201cthe only known institution that guarantees a\nminimum of opposition and of truth\u201d (AdD: 304/226). By\nexercising \u201cmethodical doubt\u201d toward the established\npowers and denying that they exhaust political and economic options,\nthe possibility opens for a genuine dialectic that advances social\njustice while respecting political freedom.\n6. The Visible and the Invisible\n\nThe manuscript and working notes published posthumously as The\nVisible and the Invisible (1964 V&I), extracted from a larger\nwork underway at the time of Merleau-Ponty\u2019s death, is\nconsidered by many to be the best presentation of his later ontology.\nThe main text, drafted in 1959 and 1960, is contemporaneous with\n\u201cEye and Mind\u201d and the Preface to Signs,\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s final collection of essays. The first three\nchapters progressively develop an account of \u201cphilosophical\ninterrogation\u201d in critical dialogue with scientism, the\nphilosophies of reflection (Descartes and Kant), Sartrean negation,\nand the intuitionisms of Bergson and Husserl. These are followed by a\nstand-alone chapter, \u201cThe Intertwining\u2014The Chiasm\u201d,\npresenting Merleau-Ponty\u2019s ontology of flesh. The published\nvolume also includes a brief abandoned section of the text as an\nappendix and more than a hundred pages of selected working notes\ncomposed between 1959 and\n 1961.[8]\n\nMerleau-Ponty frames the investigation with a description of\n\u201cperceptual faith\u201d, our shared pre-reflective conviction\nthat perception presents us with the world as it actually is, even\nthough this perception is mediated, for each of us, by our bodily\nsenses. This apparent paradox creates no difficulties in our everyday\nlives, but it becomes incomprehensible when thematized by\nreflection:\n\n\nThe \u201cnatural\u201d man holds on to both ends of the chain,\nthinks at the same time that his perception enters into the\nthings and that it is formed this side of his body. Yet coexist as the\ntwo convictions do without difficulty in the exercise of life, once\nreduced to theses and to propositions they destroy one another and\nleave us in confusion. (V&I: 23\u201324/8)\n\n\nFor Merleau-Ponty, this \u201cunjustifiable certitude of a sensible\nworld\u201d is the starting point for developing an alternative\naccount of perception, the world, intersubjective relations, and\nultimately being as such. Neither the natural sciences nor psychology\nprovide an adequate clarification of this perceptual faith, since they\nrely on it without acknowledgment even as their theoretical\nconstructions rule out its possibility. Philosophies of reflection,\nexemplified by Descartes and Kant, also fail in their account of\nperception, since they reduce the perceived world to an idea, equate\nthe subject with thought, and undermine any understanding of\nintersubjectivity or a world shared in common (V&I: 62/39,\n67/43).\n\nSartre\u2019s dialectic of being (in-itself) and nothingness\n(for-itself) makes progress over philosophies of reflection insofar as\nit recognizes the ecceity of the world, with which the subject engages\nnot as one being alongside others but rather as a nothingness, that\nis, as a determinate negation of a concrete situation that can\nco-exist alongside other determinate negations. Even so, for Sartre,\npure nothingness and pure being remain mutually exclusive,\nambivalently identical in their perfect opposition, which brings any\nmovement of their dialectic to a halt. The \u201cphilosophy of\nnegation\u201d is therefore shown to be a totalizing or\n\u201chigh-altitude\u201d thought that remains abstract, missing the\ntrue opening onto the world made possible by the fact that nothingness\nis \u201csunken into being\u201d (V&I:\n121\u2013122/88\u201389). This \u201cbad\u201d dialectic must\ntherefore give way to a \u201chyperdialectic\u201d that remains\nself-critical about its own tendency to reify into fixed and opposed\ntheses (V&I: 129/94).\n\nThe philosophy of intuition takes two forms: the Wesenschau\nof Husserl, which converts lived experience into ideal essences before\na pure spectator, and Bergsonian intuition, which seeks to coincide\nwith its object by experiencing it from within. Against the first,\nMerleau-Ponty argues that the world\u2019s givenness is more\nprimordial than the ideal essence; the essence is a variant of the\nreal, not its condition of possibility. Essences are not ultimately\ndetachable from the sensible but are its \u201cinvisible\u201d or\nits latent structure of differentiation. Against a return to the\nimmediacy of coincidence or a nostalgia for the pre-reflective,\nMerleau-Ponty holds that there is no self-identical presence to\nrejoin; the \u201cimmediate\u201d essentially involves distance and\nnon-coincidence. Consequently, truth must be redefined as \u201ca\nprivative non-coinciding, a coinciding from afar, a divergence, and\nsomething like a \u2018good error\u2019\u201d (V&I:\n166/124\u201325).\n\nIn the final chapter, \u201cThe Intertwining\u2014The Chiasm\u201d,\nMerleau-Ponty turns directly to the positive project of describing his\nontology of \u201cflesh\u201d. Intertwining [entrelacs]\nhere translates Husserl\u2019s Verflechtung, entanglement or\ninterweaving, like the woof and warp of a fabric. Chiasm has two\nsenses in French and English that are both relevant to\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s project: a physiological sense that refers to\nanatomical or genetic structures with a crossed arrangement (such as\nthe optic nerves), and a literary sense referring to figures of speech\nthat repeat structures in reverse order (AB:BA). For Merleau-Ponty,\nthe chiasm is a structure of mediation that combines the\nunity-in-difference of its physiological sense with the reversal and\ncircularity of its literary usage (see Toadvine 2012; Saint Aubert\n2005). A paradigmatic example of chiasmic structure is the\nbody\u2019s doubling into sensible and sentient aspects during\nself-touch. Elaborating on Husserl\u2019s descriptions of this\nphenomenon, Merleau-Ponty emphasizes three consequences: First, the\nbody as sensible-sentient is an \u201cexemplar sensible\u201d that\ndemonstrates the kinship or ontological continuity between subject and\nobject among sensible things in general. Second, this relationship is\nreversible, like \u201cobverse and reverse\u201d or \u201ctwo\nsegments of one sole circular course\u201d (V&I: 182/138). Third,\nthe sentient and sensible never strictly coincide but are always\nseparated by a gap or divergence [\u00e9cart] that defers\ntheir unity.\n\nChiasm is therefore a crisscrossing or a bi-directional becoming or\nexchange between the body and things that justifies speaking of a\n\u201cflesh\u201d of things, a kinship between the sensing body and\nsensed things that makes their communication possible. Flesh in this\nsense is a \u201cgeneral thing\u201d between the individual and the\nidea that does not correspond to any traditional philosophical\nconcept, but is closest to the notion of an \u201celement\u201d in\nthe classical sense (V&I: 184/139). Merleau-Ponty denies that this\nis a subjective or anthropocentric projection:\n\n\ncarnal being, as a being of depths, of several leaves or several\nfaces, a being in latency, and a presentation of a certain absence, is\na prototype of Being, of which our body, the sensible sentient, is a\nvery remarkable variant, but whose constitutive paradox already lies\nin every visible. (V&I: 179/136)\n\n\nThe generality of flesh embraces an intercorporeity, an anonymous\nsensibility shared out among distinct bodies: just as my two hands\ncommunicate across the lateral synergy of my body, I can touch the\nsensibility of another: \u201cThe handshake too is reversible\u201d\n(V&I: 187/142).\n\nSensible flesh\u2014what Merleau-Ponty calls the\n\u201cvisible\u201d\u2014is not all there is to flesh, since flesh\nalso \u201csublimates\u201d itself into an \u201cinvisible\u201d\ndimension: the \u201crarified\u201d or \u201cglorified\u201d flesh\nof ideas. Taking as his example the \u201clittle phrase\u201d from\nVinteuil\u2019s sonata (in Swann\u2019s Way), Merleau-Ponty\ndescribes literature, music, and the passions as \u201cthe\nexploration of an invisible and the disclosure of a universe of\nideas\u201d, although in such cases these ideas \u201ccannot be\ndetached from the sensible appearance and be erected into a second\npositivity\u201d (V&I: 196/149). Creative language necessarily\ncarries its meaning in a similarly embodied fashion, while the\nsediments of such expression result in language as a system of\nformalized relations. What we treat as \u201cpure ideas\u201d are\nnothing more than a certain divergence and ongoing process of\ndifferentiation, now occurring within language rather than sensible\nthings. Ultimately we find a relation of reversibility within language\nlike that holding within sensibility: just as, in order to see, my\nbody must be part of the visible and capable of being seen, so, by\nspeaking, I make myself one who can be spoken to (allocutary) and one\nwho can be spoken about (delocutary). While all of the possibilities\nof language are already outlined or promised within the sensible\nworld, reciprocally the sensible world itself is unavoidably inscribed\nwith language.\n\nThis final chapter of The Visible and the Invisible\nillustrates chiasmic mediation across a range of relations, including\nsentient and sensed, touch and vision, body and world, self and other,\nfact and essence, perception and language. There is not one chiasm but\nrather various chiasmic structures at different levels. As Renaud\nBarbaras notes,\n\n\nIt is necessary \u2026 to picture the universe as intuited by\nMerleau-Ponty as a proliferation of chiasms that integrate themselves\naccording to different levels of generality. (1991, 352/2004, 307)\n\n\nThe ultimate ontological chiasm, that between the sensible and the\nintelligible, is matched by an ultimate epistemological chiasm, that\nof philosophy itself. As Merleau-Ponty writes in a working note from\nNovember 1960,\n\n\nthe idea of chiasm, that is: every relation with being is\nsimultaneously a taking and a being held, the hold is held, it is\ninscribed and inscribed in the same being that it takes hold of.\nStarting from there, elaborate an idea of philosophy\u2026 . It is\nthe simultaneous experience of the holding and the held in all orders.\n(V&I: 319/266; see also Saint Aubert 2005: 162\u201364)\n\n7. Influence and Current Scholarship\n\nWhile the generation of French post-structuralist thinkers who\nsucceeded Merleau-Ponty, including Deleuze, Derrida, Foucault,\nIrigaray, and Nancy, typically distanced themselves from his work,\nlines of influence are often recognizable (see Lawlor 2006, 2003;\nMorin 2022; Olkowski 2021; Reynolds 2004; Venable 2022). Irigaray\n(1993) suggests that Merleau-Ponty\u2019s ontology of flesh tacitly\nrelies on feminine and maternal metaphors while rendering sexual\ndifference invisible. Derrida\u2019s most detailed engagement with\nMerleau-Ponty, in Le Toucher, Jean-Luc Nancy (On\nTouching\u2014Jean-Luc Nancy, 2000/2005), criticizes the\nlatter\u2019s account of touch and ontology of flesh for its tendency\nto privilege immediacy, continuity, and coincidence over rupture,\ndistance, and untouchability. Nevertheless, Derrida ultimately\nsuspends judgment over the relation between these two tendencies in\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s final writings. The legacy of\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s philosophy of embodiment and ontology of flesh\nis also apparent in the work of subsequent French phenomenologists,\nincluding Fran\u00e7oise Dastur, Michel Henry, Henri Maldiney,\nJean-Louis Chr\u00e9tien, and Jacob Rogozinski.\n\nRecent English-language scholarship on Merleau-Ponty, inspired by the\ngrowing availability of new materials from his course notes and\nunpublished writings, has focused on his contributions to ontology,\nepistemology, and philosophical method (Antich 2021; Beith 2018;\nBerendzon 2023; F\u00f3ti 2013; Jacobson and Russon 2017; Kaushik\n2020; Landes 2013; Mooney 2022; Morris 2018; Whitmoyer 2017), his\nrelevance to literature, architecture, and the arts (Andrews 2018;\nApostolopoulos 2019; Carbone 2015; F\u00f3ti 2021; Hale 2016;\nJohnson, Carbone, and de Saint Aubert, 2020; Kaushik 2013; Locke and\nMcCann 2015; Mildenberg 2018), his relation to historical and\ncontemporary thinkers (Chouraqui 2013; Loughnane 2019; Morin 2023;\nOlkowski 2021; Romdenh-Romluc 2019; Wirth and Burke 2014; Wambacq\n2018), and his contributions to ethical and political theory (Bahler\n2016; Daly 2016; Melan\u00e7on 2021; Smyth 2014). Feminist\nphenomenology and critical phenomenology have drawn on\nMerleau-Ponty\u2019s accounts of embodiment, embodied habits,\nnormativity, and sexuality, albeit with important qualifications\nconcerning the limitations and problemmatic assumptions in his\nthinking (Ahmed 2006; Alcoff 2006; Anderson 2022; Hein\u00e4maa 2003;\nLajoie and Toadvine 2021 and 2022; Lee 2014; Ngo 2017; Oksala 2016;\nOlkowski and Weiss 2006; Ortega 2016; Salamon 2018; Weiss 2015; Young\n2005). Merleau-Ponty\u2019s work has also made important\ncontributions to debates in animal studies (Buchanan 2009; Dufourcq\n2022; Oliver 2009; Westling 2014), cognitive science (Gallagher 2005;\nThompson 2007), environmental philosophy (Abram 1996; Cataldi and\nHamrick 2007; Toadvine 2009), and psychopathology (McDonald 2019;\nVenable 2021).\n",
