Types of Religious Experience\n\nReports of religious experiences reveal a variety of different kinds.\nPerhaps most are visual or auditory presentations (visions and\nauditions), but not through the physical eyes or ears. Subjects report\n\u201cseeing\u201d or \u201chearing,\u201d but quickly disavow any\nclaim to seeing or hearing with bodily sense organs. Such experiences\nare easy to dismiss as hallucinations, but the subjects of the\nexperience frequently claim that though it is entirely internal, like\na hallucination or imagination, it is nevertheless a veridical\nexperience, through some spiritual analog of the eye or ear (James\n1902 and Alston 1991 cite many examples). \nIn other cases, the language of \u201cseeing\u201d is used in its\nextended sense of realization, as when a yogi is said to\n\u201csee\u201d his or her identity with Brahman; Buddhists speak of\n\u201cseeing things as they are\u201d as one of the hallmarks of\ntrue enlightenment, where this means grasping or realizing the\nemptiness of things, but not in a purely intellectual way.\n\nA third type is the religious experience that comes through\nsensory experiences of ordinary objects, but seems to carry with it\nextra information about some supramundane reality. Examples include\nexperiencing God in nature, in the starry sky, or a flower, or the\nlike. Another person standing nearby would see exactly the same sky or\nflower, but would not necessarily have the further religious content\nto his or her experience. There are also cases in which the religious\nexperience just is an ordinary perception, but the physical object is\nitself the object of religious significance. Moses\u2019s experience\nof the burning bush, or the Buddha\u2019s disciples watching him\nlevitate, are examples of this type. A second person standing nearby\nwould see exactly the same phenomenon. Witnesses to miracles are\nhaving that kind of religious experience, whether they understand it\nthat way or not. \n\nA fourth type of religious experience is harder to\ndescribe: it can\u2019t be characterized accurately in sensory\nlanguage, even analogically, yet the subject of the experience insists\nthat the experience is a real, direct awareness of some religiously\nsignificant reality external to the subject. These kinds of\nexperiences are usually described as \u201cineffable.\u201d\nDepending on one\u2019s purposes, other ways of dividing up religious\nexperiences will suggest themselves. For example, William James (1902)\ndivides experiences into \u201chealthy-minded\u201d and\n\u201csick-minded,\u201d according to the personality of the\nsubject, which colors the content of the experience itself. Keith\nYandell (1993, 25\u201332) divided them into five categories,\naccording to the content of the experiences: monotheistic, nirvanic\n(enlightenment experiences associated with Buddhism), kevalic\n(enlightenment experiences associated with Jainism), moksha\n(experiences of release from karma, associated with Hinduism), and\nnature experiences. Differences of object certainly make differences\nin content, and so make differences in what can be said about the\nexperiences. See Section 4 for further discussion of this\nissue.\n",
