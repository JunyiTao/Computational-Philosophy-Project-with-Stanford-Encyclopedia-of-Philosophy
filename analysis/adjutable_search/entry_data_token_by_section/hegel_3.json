    "main_text": "Hegel\u2019s Philosophy || The traditional metaphysical view of Hegel\u2019s philosophy\n2.2 The traditional metaphysical view of Hegel\u2019s philosophy\nGiven the understanding of Hegel that predominated at the time of\nthe birth of analytic philosophy, together with the fact that early\nanalytic philosophers were rebelling precisely against\nHegelianism so understood, the interpretation of Hegel\nencountered in discussions within analytic philosophy is often that of\nthe late nineteenth-century interpretation. In this picture, Hegel is\nseen as offering a metaphysico-religious view of God qua\nAbsolute Spirit, as the ultimate reality that we can\ncome to know through pure thought processes alone. In short,\nHegel\u2019s philosophy is treated as exemplifying the type of\npre-critical or dogmatic metaphysics against which Kant\nhad reacted in his Critique of Pure Reason, and as a return\nto a more religiously driven conception of philosophy to which Kant\nhad been opposed.\nThere is much that can be found in Hegel\u2019s writings that\nseems to support this view. In his lectures during his Berlin period\none comes across claims such as the one that philosophy \u201chas no\nother object but God and so is essentially rational theology\u201d\n(Aes I: 101). Indeed, Hegel often seems to invoke imagery consistent\nwith the types of neo-Platonic conceptions of the universe that had\nbeen common within Christian mysticism, especially in the German\nstates, in the early modern period. The peculiarity of Hegel\u2019s\nform of idealism, on this account, lies in his idea that the mind of\nGod becomes actual only via its particularization in the minds of\n\u201chis\u201d finite material creatures. Thus, in our\nconsciousness of God, we somehow serve to realize his own\nself-consciousness, and, thereby, his own perfection. In\nEnglish-language interpretations, such a picture is effectively found\nin the work of Charles Taylor (1975) and Michael Rosen\n(1984), for example. With\nits dark mystical roots, and its overtly religious content, it is\nhardly surprising that the philosophy of Hegel so understood has\nrarely been regarded as a live option within the largely\nsecular and scientific conceptions of philosophy that\nhave been dominant in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\nAn important consequence of Hegel\u2019s metaphysics, so\nunderstood, concerns history and the idea of historical development or\nprogress, and it is as an advocate of an idea concerning the\nlogically-necessitated teleological course of history that Hegel is\nmost often derided. To critics, such as Karl Popper in his popular\npost-war The Open Society and its\nEnemies (1945), Hegel had not only advocated a disastrous political\nconception of the state and the relation of its citizens to it, a\nconception prefiguring twentieth-century totalitarianism, but he had\nalso tried to underpin such advocacy with dubious\ntheo-logico-metaphysical speculations. With his idea of the\ndevelopment of spirit in history, Hegel is seen as\nliteralising a way of talking about different cultures in terms of\ntheir spirits, of constructing a developmental sequence\nof epochs typical of nineteenth-century ideas of linear historical\nprogress, and then enveloping this story of human progress in terms of\none about the developing self-conscious of the cosmos-God itself.\nAs the bottom line of such an account concerned the evolution of\nstates of a mind (God\u2019s), such an account is clearly an idealist\none, but not in the sense, say, of Berkeley. The pantheistic legacy\ninherited by Hegel meant that he had no problem in considering an\nobjective outer world beyond any particular subjective mind.\nBut this objective world itself had to be understood as conceptually\ninformed: it was objectified spirit. Thus in contrast to\nBerkeleian subjective idealism it became common to talk\nof Hegel as incorporating the objective idealism of\nviews, especially common among German historians, in which social life\nand thought were understood in terms of the conceptual or\nspiritual structures that informed them. But in contrast\nto both forms of idealism, Hegel, according to this reading,\npostulated a form of absolute idealism by including both\nsubjective life and the objective cultural practices on which\nsubjective life depended within the dynamics of the development of the\nself-consciousness and self-actualisation of God, the Absolute\nSpirit.\nDespite this seemingly dominant theological theme, Hegel was still\nseen by many as an important precursor of other more\ncharacteristically secular strands of modern thought such as\nexistentialism and Marxist materialism. Existentialists were thought\nof as taking the idea of the finitude and historical and cultural\ndependence of individual subjects from Hegel, and as leaving out all\npretensions to the Absolute, while Marxists were thought\nof as taking the historical dynamics of the Hegelian picture but\nreinterpreting this in materialist rather than idealist categories. As\nfor understanding Hegel himself, the traditional metaphysical view\nremained the dominant interpretative approach of Hegel scholars\nthroughout much of the twentieth century. In the last quarter of the\ncentury, however, it came to be vigorously questioned, with a variety\nof interpreters putting forward very different accounts of the basic\nnature of Hegel\u2019s philosophical project. While a number of\ninterpretations of Hegel have emerged during this period in an effort\nto acquit him of implausible metaphysico-theological views, one\nprominent tendency has been to stress the continuity of his ideas with\nthe \u201ccritical philosophy\u201d of Immanuel Kant.\n",
