Examples that illustrate the difference between a priori and a posteriori (empirical) justification\n\nA priori justification is a certain kind of justification\noften contrasted with empirical, or a posteriori,\njustification. Roughly speaking, a priori justification\nprovides reasons for thinking a proposition is true that comes from\nmerely understanding, or thinking about, that proposition. In\ncontrast, a posteriori justification requires more than\nmerely understanding a proposition. Observations based on our senses,\nor introspection about our current mental state, are needed for us to\nbe empirically, or a posteriori, justified in believing that\nsome proposition is true. Examples below bring out the contrast. The\nfirst proposition in each group is a prime candidate for being a\npriori justified, if justified at all, while the other\npropositions are prime candidates for being a posteriori\njustified, if justified at all. Some of the propositions are false,\nbut that does not mean that we could not be justified in believing\nthem before we had evidence that they are false.\n\n1\n\n\na.\nAll bachelors are unmarried males.\nb.\n All bachelors in the U.S. are taxed at a different rate from\nmarried men.\n\n2\n\n\na.\n All vixens are female.\nb.\n All vixens are cunning.\n\n3\n\n\na.\n Green is a color.\nb.\n Grass is green.\n\n4\n\n\na.\n All Crimson things are red.\nb.\n All recent volumes of Who\u2019s Who are red.\n(Williamson 2013: 295)\n\n5\n\n\na.\n A house is an abode for living.\nb.\n A house undermined will fall. (Bealer 1992: 102; 1998: 207,\n211)\n\n6\n\n\na.\n All squares are rectangles.\nb.\n No square-shaped object has a surface area greater than the total\nsurface area of the United States.\n\n7\n\n\na.\n If you know something, you believe it and it\u2019s true.\nb.\n I know that the earth is round.\n\n8\n\n\na.\n A mountain is a raised surface of limited area, larger than a\nhill, usually with steep slopes and a peak.\nb.\n There are mountains.\n\n9\n\n\na.\n 2 + 2 = 4.\nb.\n 2 quarts of any liquid added to 2 more quarts of any liquid = 4\nquarts of liquid.\n\n10\n\n\na.\n No object can be red and green all over at the same time.\nb.\n There are ripe tomatoes that are now red all over but were green\nall over weeks earlier.\n\n11\n\n\na.\n If A is taller than B, and B is taller than\nC, then A is taller than C.\nb.\n Kevin Durant is taller than Lebron James, and Lebron James is\ntaller than Steph Curry (famous basketball players).\n\n12\n\n\na.\n Happiness is an intrinsic good.\nb.\n Happiness is the result of doing what you like.\n\n13\n\n\na.\n It is wrong to punish the innocent.\nb.\n People who are unjustly punished often become angry and\nresentful.\n\n14\n\n\na.\n Torturing children just for the fun of it is wrong.\nb.\n Torture often produces unreliable testimony.\n\n15\n\n\na.\nAll rubies are red.\nb.\n\n\ni.\n All rubies have chemical structure\nAl2O3.\nii.\n Topaz is either blue, orange, yellow, or yellowish brown.\niii.\n Water is H2O.\n\n\n\n\nIn each example, it is possible for someone to be justified in\nbelieving the first member in a way that is different from how it is\npossible for someone to be justified in believing the other members of\nthe example. The way the first members can be justified is called\na priori; the way the other members can be justified is\ncalled a posteriori (or empirically).\n\nThe first question to discuss is what sorts of propositions can be\na priori justified and known.\n",
