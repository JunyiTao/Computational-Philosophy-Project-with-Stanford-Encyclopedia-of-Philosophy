    "main_text": "Ontological Aspects of Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism || Logical Atoms and Simplicity\n4.2 Logical Atoms and Simplicity\n\n \nRussell\u2019s use of the phrase \u201catomic fact\u201d, and indeed the very title\nof \u201clogical atomism\u201d suggest that the constituents of atomic facts,\nthe \u201clogical atoms\u201d, Russell spoke of, must be regarded as utterly\nsimple and devoid of complexity. In that case, the particulars,\nqualities and relations making up atomic facts constitute the\nfundamental level of reality to which all other aspects of reality are\nultimately reducible. This attitude is confirmed especially in\nRussell\u2019s early logical atomist writings. For example, in \u201cAnalytic\nRealism\u201d, Russell wrote:\n\n\n\n\u2026 the philosophy I espouse is analytic,\nbecause it claims that one must discover the simple elements of which\ncomplexes are composed, and that complexes presuppose simples, whereas\nsimples do not presuppose complexes \u2026 \n\n\n I believe there are simple beings in the universe, and that these\nbeings have relations in virtue of which complex beings are\ncomposed. Any time a bears the relation R to\nb there is a complex \u201ca in relation R to\nb\u201d \u2026 \n\n You will note that this philosophy is the philosophy of logical\natomism. Every simple entity is an atom. (RA,  94)\n\n\n \nElsewhere he spoke of \u201clogical atomism\u201d as involving the\nview that \u201cyou can get down in theory, if not in practice, to\nultimate simples, out of which the world is built, and that those\nsimples have a kind of reality not belonging to anything else\u201d\n(PLA, 270). However, it has been questioned whether Russell\nhad sufficient argumentation for thinking that there are such simple\nbeings.\n\n \nIn the abstract, there are two sorts of arguments Russell could have\ngiven for the existence of simples, a priori arguments, or\nempirical arguments (cf. Pears 1985, 4ff). An a priori\nargument might proceed from the very understanding of complexity: what\nis complex presupposes parts. In 1924, Russell wrote, \u201cI confess it\nseems obvious to me (as it did Leibniz) that what is complex must be\ncomposed of simples, though the number of constituents may be\ninfinite\u201d (LA, 337). However, if construed as an argument,\nthis does not seem very convincing. It seems at least logically\npossible that while a complex may have parts, its parts might\nthemselves be complex, and their parts might also be complex, and\nso on, ad infinitum.  Indeed, Russell himself later came to\nadmit that one could not know simply on the basis of something being\ncomplex that it must be composed of simples (MPD, 123).\n\n \nAnother sort of a priori argument might stem from conceptions\nregarding the nature of analysis. As analysis proceeds, one\nreaches more primitive notions, and it might be thought that the\nprocess must terminate at a stage in which the remaining vocabulary is\nindefinable because the entities involved are absolutely simple, and\nhence, cannot be construed as logical constructions built out of\nanything more primitive. Russell did at some points describe his\nlogical atoms as reached at \u201cthe limit of analysis\u201d (LA, 337)\nor \u201cthe final residue in analysis\u201d (MPD, 164). However, even\nduring the height of his logical atomist period, Russell admitted that\nit is possible that \u201canalysis could go on forever\u201d, and that complex\nthings might be capable of analysis \u201cad infinitum\u201d\n(PLA, 202).\n\n \nLastly, one might argue for simples as the basis of an empirical\nargument; i.e., one might claim to have completed the process of\nanalysis and to have reduced all sorts of truths down to certain\nentities that can be known in some way or another to be\nsimple. Russell is sometimes interpreted as having reasoned in this\nway. According to Russell\u2019s well known \u201cprinciple of acquaintance\u201d in\nepistemology, in order to understand a proposition, one must be\nacquainted with the meaning of every simple symbol making it up (see,\ne.g., KAKD, 159).  Russell at times suggested that we are\nonly directly acquainted with sense data, and their properties and\nrelations, and perhaps with our own selves (KAKD, 154ff). It\nmight be thought that these entities are simple, and must constitute\nthe terminus of analysis. However, Russell was explicit that\nsense data can themselves be complex, and that he knew of no reason to\nsuppose that we cannot be acquainted with a complex without being\naware that it is complex and without being acquainted with its\nconstituents (KAKD, 153; cf. TK, 120). Moreover, Russell continued to use the label \u201clogical atomism\u201d to describe his philosophy long after his epistemology had ceased to center around the acquaintance relation. (For further argumentation on these points, see Elkind 2018.) Indeed,\nRussell eventually came to the conclusion that nothing can ever be\nknown to be simple (MPD, 123).\n\n \nWhile there is significant evidence that Russell did believe in the\nexistence of simple entities in the early phases of his logical\natomist period, it is possible that, uncharacteristically, he held\nthis belief without argumentation.  In admitting that it is possible\nthat analysis could go on ad infinitum, Russell claimed that\n\u201cI do not think it is true, but it is a thing that one might argue,\ncertainly\u201d (PLA, 202). In his 1924 piece \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d,\nRussell admitted that \u201cby greater logical skill, the need for assuming\nthem [i.e. simples] could be avoided\u201d.  This attitude may explain in\npart why it is that at the outset of his 1918 lectures on logical atomism,\nhe claimed that \u201c[t]he things I am going to say in these lectures are\nmainly my own personal opinions and I do not claim that they are more\nthan that\u201d (PLA, 178). It may have been that Russell was\ninterested not so much in establishing definitively that there are any\nabsolutely simple entities, but rather in combating the widespread\narguments of others that the notion of a simple, independent entity is\nincoherent, and only the whole of the universe is fundamentally\nreal. According to Russell, such attitudes are customarily traced to a\nwrong view about relations; in arguing for the doctrine of \u201cexternal\nrelations\u201d, Russell was attempting simply to render a world of simple\nentities coherent again. Others had argued that possessing an inner complexity in the form of \u201cnature\u201d was needed to explain the essential properties of things or the necessary connections between them; as we shall see in Section 4.3 below, Russell believed that such apparent essential properties or necessary relations could typically be explained away.\n\n As his career progressed, Russell became more and more prone to\nemphasize that what is important for his philosophical outlook\nis not absolute simplicity, but only relative simplicity. As\nearly as 1922, in response to criticism about his notion of\nsimplicity, Russell wrote:\n\n As for \u201cabstract analysis in search of the \u2018simple\u2019 and\nelemental\u201d, that is a more important matter.  To begin with, \u201csimple\u201d\nmust not be taken in an absolute sense; \u201csimpler\u201d would be a better\nword. Of course, I should be glad to reach the absolutely simple, but\nI do not believe that that is within human capacity. What I do\nmaintain is that, whenever anything is complex, out knowledge is\nadvanced by discovering constituents of it, even if these constituents\nthemselves are still complex. (SA, 40)\n\n According to Russell, analysis proceeds in stages.  When analysis\nshows the terminology and presuppositions of one stage of analysis to\nbe definable, or logically constructible, in terms of simpler and more\nbasic notions, this is a philosophical advance, even if these notions\nare themselves further analyzable. As Russell says, the only drawback\nto a language which is not yet fully analyzed is that in it,\none cannot speak of anything more fundamental than those objects,\nproperties or relations that are named at that level (e.g.,\nLA, 337).\n\n \nIn a later work, Russell summarized his position as follows:\n\n If the world is composed of simples\u2014i.e., of things, qualities and\nrelations that are devoid of structure\u2014then not only all our\nknowledge but all that of Omniscience could be expressed by means of\nwords denoting these simples. We could distinguish in the world a\nstuff (to use William James\u2019s word) and a structure. The stuff would\nconsist of all the simples denoted by names, while the structure would\ndepend on relations and qualities for which our minimum vocabulary\nwould have words.\n\n \n This conception can be applied without assuming that there is anything\nabsolutely simple. We can define as \u201crelatively simple\u201d whatever we do\nnot know to be complex. Results obtained using the concept of\n\u201crelative simplicity\u201d will still be true if complexity is afterward\nfound, provided we have abstained from asserting absolute simplicity\n(HK, 259)\n\n\n  Russell concluded that even if there are no ultimate simples, no\nfundamental layer of reality that analysis can in principle reach,\nthis does not invalidate analysis as a philosophical\nprocedure. Moreover, at a given stage of analysis, a certain class of\nsentences may still be labeled as \u201catomic\u201d, even if the facts\ncorresponding to them cannot be regarded as built of fundamental\nontological atoms (MPD, 165). Russell concluded that \u201cthe\nwhole question whether there are simples to be reached by analysis is\nunnecessary\u201d (MPD, 123).  From this vantage point, it might\nbe argued that Russell\u2019s \u201clogical atomism\u201d can be understood as first\nand foremost a commitment to analysis as a method coupled with a\nrejection of idealistic monism, rather than a pretense to have\ndiscovered the genuine metaphysical \u201catoms\u201d making up the world of\nfacts, or even the belief that such a discovery is possible\n(cf. Linsky 2003; Maclean 2018). Indeed, Russell continued to use the phrase\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d to describe his philosophy in later years of his\ncareer, during the period in which he stressed relative, not absolute\nsimplicity (RTC, 717; MPD, 9).\n",
