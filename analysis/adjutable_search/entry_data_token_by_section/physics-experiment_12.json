Computer Simulations and Experimentation\n\nOne interesting recent development in science, and thus in the\nphilosophy of science, has been the increasing use of, and importance\nof, computer simulations. In some fields, such as high-energy physics,\nsimulations are an essential part of all experiments. It is fair to\nsay that without computer simulations these experiments would be\nimpossible. There has been a considerable literature in the philosophy\nof science discussing whether computer simulations are experiments,\ntheory, or some new kind of hybrid method of doing science. But, as\nEric Winsberg remarked, \u201cWe have in other words, rejected the\noverly conservative intuition that computer simulation is nothing but\nboring and straightforward theory application. But we have avoided\nembracing the opposite, overly grandiose intuition that simulation is\na radically new kind of knowledge production, \u201don a par\u201c\nwith experimentation. In fact, we have seen that soberly locating\nsimulation \u201don the methodological map\u201c is not a simple\nmatter (Winsberg 2010, p. 136).\u201d\n\nGiven the importance of computer simulations in science it is\nessential that we have good reasons to believe their results. Eric\nWinsberg (2010), Wendy Parker (2008) and others have shown that\nscientists use strategies quite similar to those discussed in Section\n1.1.1, to argue for the correctness of computer simulations.\n",
