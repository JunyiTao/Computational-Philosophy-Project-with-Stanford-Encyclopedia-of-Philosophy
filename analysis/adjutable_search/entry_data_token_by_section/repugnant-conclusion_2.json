    "main_text": "Eight Ways of Dealing with the Repugnant Conclusion || Introducing new ways of aggregating welfare into a measure of value\n2.1 Introducing new ways of aggregating welfare into a measure of value\n2.1.1 The average principle\n\nOne proposal that easily comes to mind when faced with the Repugnant\nConclusion is to reject total utilitarianism in favor of a principle\nprescribing that the average welfare per life in a population\nis maximized. Average utilitarianism and total utilitarianism are\nextensionally equivalent in the sense that they yield the same ranking\nwhen the compared populations are of the same size. They may differ\nsignificantly in different-number cases, however. This is easily seen\nwhen the average approach is adopted in the comparison of the\npopulations in Figure 1 and Figure 2. That the average well-being is\nall that matters implies that no loss in average well-being can be\ncompensated for by a gain in total well-being. Thus in Figure 1,\nA is preferable to Z, i.e., the Repugnant Conclusion is\navoided. In Figure 2, A is preferable to A+, i.e., the\nMere Addition Paradox is blocked at the very first step.\n\nDespite these advantages, average utilitarianism has not obtained much\nacceptance in the philosophical literature. This is due to the fact\nthat the principle has implications generally regarded as highly\ncounterintuitive. For instance, the principle implies that for any\npopulation consisting of very good lives there is a better population\nconsisting of just one person leading a life at a slightly higher\nlevel of well-being (Parfit 1984 chapter 19). More dramatically, the\nprinciple also implies that for a population consisting of just one\nperson leading a life at a very negative level of well-being, e.g., a\nlife of constant torture, there is another population which is better\neven though it contains millions of lives at just a slightly less\nnegative level of well-being (Parfit 1984). That total well-being\nshould not matter when we are considering lives worth ending is hard\nto accept. Moreover, average utilitarianism has implications very\nsimilar to the Repugnant Conclusion (see Sikora 1975; Anglin\n1977).\n2.1.2 Variable value principles\n\nAn attempt to produce a compromise between a total principle and an\naverage principle is provided by a variable value principle. The idea\nbehind this view is that the value of adding worthwhile lives to a\npopulation varies with the number of already existing lives in such a\nway that it has more value when the number of these lives is small\nthan when it is large (Hurka 1983, Ng 1989; Sider 1991). Taking this\nview, Noah\u2019s obligation to procreate after the Deluge was much\nstronger than our obligation today. Variable value principles are\nsometimes called \u201ccompromise theories\u201d since they can be\nsaid to be a compromise between total and average utilitarianism (for\na version that is sensitive to more aspects regarding welfare, see\nTemkin 1997, 2012). With small populations enjoying high welfare, a\nvariable value principle behaves like total utilitarianism and assigns\nmost of the value to the total sum of welfare. For large populations\nwith low welfare, the principle mimics average utilitarianism and\nassigns most of the value to average welfare. This property is what\nmakes it possible to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion. If the value of\nextra lives decreases asymptotically, then there may exist an upper\nlimit to the total value of a population (exactly as the sum of the\ninfinite series 1+1/2+1/4+ \u2026 has the upper limit 2). As long as\npopulation A in Fig. 1 has a total value above this limit this\npopulation will be preferable no matter how populous the low quality\npopulation Z is (Hurka 1983, Ng 1989; Sider 1991; Temkin 1997,\n2012).\n\nDepending on how precisely various different value principles are\nworked out they have different implications, which critics have\nregarded as devastating. For instance, on Ng\u2019s explication of\nthis view (Ng 1989) according to which the value of a population is\ndetermined by the product of the average welfare and a concave\ntransformation of the number of lives, it follows that it can be\nbetter to add people with negative welfare rather than positive\nwelfare to a population. More exactly, Ng\u2019s theory implies the\n\u201cSadistic Conclusion\u201d (Arrhenius 2000a): For any number of\nlives with any negative welfare (e.g. tormented lives), there are\nsituations in which it would be better to add these lives rather than\nsome number of lives with positive welfare. Moreover, even if it might\nbe reasonable to hold that the value of extra lives with positive\nwelfare decreases asymptotically towards a limit, the analogous\nassumption about lives with negative welfare isn\u2019t very\nattractive. Hence, given the reasonable assumption that the negative\nvalue of adding extra lives with negative welfare does not decrease\nrelatively to population size, a proportional expansion in the\npopulation size can turn a good population into a bad one\u2014a\nversion of the so-called \u201cAbsurd Conclusion\u201d (Parfit\n1984). A population of one million people enjoying very high positive\nwelfare and one person with negative welfare seems intuitively to be a\ngood population. However, since there is a limit to the positive value\nof positive welfare but no limit to the negative value of negative\nwelfare, proportional expansions (two million lives with positive\nwelfare and two lives with negative welfare, three million lives with\npositive welfare and three lives with negative welfare, and so forth)\nwill in the end yield a bad population.\n2.1.3 Critical level principles\n\nAnother way of modifying total utilitarianism is to introduce a\ncritical level (Kavka 1982, Parfit 1984; Locke 1984; Blackorby et\nal. 1997, 2004, 2005; Broome 2004). As is the case with the\nvariable value view, a critical level view is based on a split between\nprudential and moral value. However, in this case the split is even\nmore radical. The idea is that a person\u2019s life contributes\npositively to the value of a population only if the quality of the\nperson\u2019s life is above a certain positive critical level. Below\nthis level the contributive value of a life is neutral (Kavka 1982),\nnegative (Blackorby et al. 1997, 2004, 2005; cf.\nFeldman\u2019s theory below), or introduces incommensurability or\nvagueness in the ordering of populations (Blackorby et al.\n2005; Broome 2004; Rabinowicz 2009; cf. Parfit 2016), even though the\nperson leads a life worth living. In its simplest form, the critical\nlevel view is a modified version of total utilitarianism. The\ncontributive value of a person\u2019s life is her welfare minus a\npositive critical level. The value of a population is calculated by\nsumming these differences for all individuals in the population. The\ncritical level view thereby succeeds in avoiding the Repugnant\nConclusion. Assuming the critical level is higher than the individual\nwelfare levels in population Z, the Repugnant Conclusion is\nblocked since the value of Z is negative, and thus worse than\nA, according to the critical level view.\n\nAn obvious challenge to critical level thinking is to make clear what\nconstitutes the appropriate critical level. On the one hand, the level\nhas to be high enough to avoid versions of the Repugnant Conclusion;\non the other, the level has to be low enough not to rule out additions\nof clearly good lives (for an attempted answer to this challenge see\nBlackorby et al. 1997; Broome 2004). Critics have also been\nsceptical to the idea that the addition of lives worth living (albeit\nbelow the critical level) contribute negatively to the value of a\npopulation. Finally, it has been shown that this view leads to the\nSadistic Conclusion (see above).\n",
