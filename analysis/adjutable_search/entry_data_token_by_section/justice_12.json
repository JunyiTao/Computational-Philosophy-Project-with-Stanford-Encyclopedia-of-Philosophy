    "main_text": "The Scope of Justice || Relational vs Non-Relational Justice\n3.2 Relational vs Non-Relational Justice\n\nThe Rawlsian view introduced in the previous section, which holds that\nprinciples of social justice apply among people who are engaged\ntogether in a co-operative practice, is a leading example of a\nrelational theory of justice. Other theories offer different accounts\nof the relevant justice-generating feature: for example, Nagel has\nargued that principles of distributive justice apply among people who\nby virtue of being citizens of the same state are required both to\ncomply with, and accept responsibility for, the coercive laws that\ngovern their lives (Nagel 2005). In both cases, the claim being made\nis that when people stand in a certain relationship to one another,\nthey become subject to principles of justice whose scope is limited to\nthose within the relationship. In particular, comparative\nprinciples apply within the relationship, but not beyond it. If\nA stands in a relationship (of the right kind) to B,\nthen it becomes a matter of justice how A is treated relative\nto B, but it does not matter in the same way how A is\ntreated relative to C who stands outside of the relationship.\nJustice may still require that C be given treatment of a\ncertain kind, but that will be justice in its non-comparative\nguise.\n\nWhether justice is relational in either of the ways that Rawls and\nNagel suggest has large implications for its scope. In particular it\nbears on the question whether there is such a thing as global\ndistributive justice, or, in contrast, whether distributive\nprinciples only apply to people who are related together as members of\nthe same society or citizens of the same state. For example, might the\nglobal inequalities that exist between rich and poor in today\u2019s\nworld be unjust simply as inequalities, or are they unjust\nonly insofar as they prevent poor people from living lives that we\njudge to be acceptable? (see entries on\n international distributive justice\n and\n global justice)\n So much hangs on the question whether, and if so in virtue of what,\ndistributive justice has a relational character. What reason can be\ngiven for thinking that it does?\n\nSuppose we have two people A and B, of whom one is\nsignificantly better off than another \u2013 has greater\nopportunities or a higher income, say. Why should this be a concern of\njustice? It seems it will not be a concern unless it can be shown that\nthe inequality between A and B can be attributed to the\nbehaviour of some agent, individual or collective, whose actions or\nomissions have resulted in A being better off than B\n\u2013 in which case we can ask whether the inequality between them\nis justifiable, say on grounds of their respective deserts. This\nreiterates the claim in 1.4 above that without an agent to whom the\noutcome can be attributed there can only be justice or injustice in a\nmetaphorical, \u2018cosmic\u2019, sense. Relational theorists claim\nthat when people associate with one another in the relevant way, they\nbecome agents of justice. On a small scale they can organize\ninformally to ensure that each receives what is due to him relative to\nthe rest. On a larger scale, distributive justice requires the\ncreation of legal and other institutions to achieve that outcome.\nMoreover failure to co-ordinate their actions in this way is likely to\nbe a source of injustice by omission.\n\nDebates about the scope of justice then become debates about whether\ndifferent forms of human association are of the right kind to create\nagency in the relevant sense. Take the question of whether principles\nof social justice should apply to market transactions. If we see the\nmarket as a neutral arena in which many individual people freely\npursue their own purposes, then the answer will be No. The only form\nof justice that arises will be justice in the conduct of each agent,\nwho must avoid inflicting harm on others, must fulfil her contracts,\nand so forth. Whereas if we see the market as governed by a\nhumanly-constructed system of rules that the participants collectively\nhave the power to change \u2013 by legislation, for example \u2013\nthen we cannot avoid asking whether the outcomes it currently produces\nmeet relevant standards of distributive justice, whatever we take\nthese to be. A similar issue arises in the debate about over\nprinciples of global justice referred to above: is the current world\norder such that it makes sense to regard humanity as a whole as a\ncollective agent responsible for the distributive outcomes it allows\nto occur?\n",
