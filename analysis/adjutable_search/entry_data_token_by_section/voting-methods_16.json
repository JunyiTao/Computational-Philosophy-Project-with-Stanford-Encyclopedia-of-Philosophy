The main\nquestion is whether the voting paradoxes are simply features of the\nformal framework used to represent an election scenario or\nformalizations of real-life phenomena. This raises a number of subtle\nissues about the scope of mathematical modeling in the social\nsciences, many of which fall outside the scope of this article. I\nconclude with a brief discussion of two questions that shed some light\non how one should interpret the above analysis. \n\nHow likely is a Condorcet Paradox or any of the other\nvoting paradoxes?  There are two ways to approach this question.\nThe first is to calculate the probability that a majority cycle will\noccur in an election scenario. There is a sizable literature devoted\nto analytically deriving the probability of a majority cycle occurring\nin election scenarios of varying sizes (see Gehrlein 2006, and\nRegenwetter et al. 2006, for overviews of this literature).\nThe calculations depend on assumptions about the distribution of\nrankings among the voters. One distribution that is\ntypically used is the so-called impartial culture, where each\nranking is possible and occurs with equal probability. For\nexample, if there are three candidates, and it is assumed that the\nvoters\u2019 ballots are rankings of the candidates, then each possible ranking \ncan occur with probability 1/6. Under this assumption,\nthe probability of a majority cycle occurring has been calculated (see\nGehrlein 2006, for details). Riker (1982, p. 122) has a table of the\nrelevant calculations. Two observations about this data: First, as the\nnumber of candidates and voters increases, the probability of a\nmajority cycles increases to certainty. Second, for a fixed number of\ncandidates, the probability of a majority cycle still increases,\nthough not necessarily to certainty (the number of voters is the\nindependent variable here). For example, if there are five candidates\nand seven voters, then the probability of a majority cycle is 21.5\npercent. This probability increases to 25.1 percent as the number of\nvoters increases to infinity (keeping the number of candidates fixed)\nand to 100 percent as the number of candidates increases to infinity\n(keeping the number of voters fixed). Prima facie, this result\nsuggests that we should expect to see instances of the Condorcet and\nrelated paradoxes in large elections. Of course, this interpretation\ntakes it for granted that the impartial culture is a realistic\nassumption. Many authors have noted that the impartial culture is a\nsignificant idealization that almost certainly does not occur in\nreal-life elections. Tsetlin et al. (2003) go even further arguing\nthat the impartial culture is a worst-case scenario in the sense that\nany deviation results in lower probabilities of a majority\ncycle (see Regenwetter et al. 2006, for a complete discussion\nof this issue, and List and Goodin  2001, Appendix 3,  for a related result). \n\nA second way to argue that the above theoretical observations are\nrobust is to find supporting empirical evidence. For instance, is\nthere evidence that majority cycles have occurred in actual elections?\nWhile Riker (1982) offers a number of intriguing examples, the most\ncomprehensive analysis of the empirical evidence for majority cycles\nis provided by Mackie (2003, especially Chapters 14 and 15). The\nconclusion is that, in striking contrast to the probabilistic analysis\nreferenced above, majority cycles typically have not occurred in\nactual elections. However, this literature has not reached a consensus\nabout this issue (cf. Riker 1982): The problem is that the available\ndata typically does not include voters\u2019 opinions about all\npairwise comparison of candidates, which is needed to determine if\nthere is a majority cycle. So, this information must be\ninferred (for example, by using statistical methods) from the\ngiven data. \n\nA related line of research focuses on  the  influence of  factors, \nsuch as polls (Reijngoud and Endriss 2012), \nsocial networks (Santoro and Beck 2017, Stirling 2016) and deliberation \namong the voters (List 2018), on the profiles of ballots that are actually \nrealized  in an election.  For instance, List et al. 2013 has evidence \nsuggesting that deliberation reduces the probability of a Condorcet cycle occurring. \n\n\nHow do the different voting methods compare in actual elections?\n In this article, I have analyzed voting methods under highly\nidealized assumptions. But, in the end, we are interested in a very\npractical question: Which method should a group adopt? Of\ncourse, any answer to this question will depend on many factors that\ngo beyond the abstract analysis given above  (cf. Edelman 2012a). An interesting line of\nresearch focuses on incorporating empirical evidence into the\ngeneral theory of voting. Evidence can come in the form of a computer\nsimulation, a detailed analysis of a particular voting method in\nreal-life elections (for example, see Brams 2008, Chapter 1, which\nanalyzes Approval voting in practice), or as in situ\nexperiments in which voters are asked to fill in additional ballots\nduring an actual election (Laslier 2010, 2011). \n\nThe most striking results  can be found in the work of\nMichael Regenwetter and his colleagues. They have analyzed datasets\nfrom a variety of elections, showing that many of the usual voting\nmethods that are considered irreconcilable (e.g., Plurality Rule, Borda\nCount and the  Condorcet consistent methods from Section 3.1.1) are, in fact, in\nperfect agreement. This suggests that the \u201ctheoretical\nliterature may promote overly pessimistic views about the likelihood\nof consensus among consensus methods\u201d (Regenwetter et\nal. 2009, p. 840). See Regenwetter et al. 2006 for an\nintroduction to the methods used in these analyses and Regenwetter\net al. 2009 for the current state-of-the-art. \n\n",
