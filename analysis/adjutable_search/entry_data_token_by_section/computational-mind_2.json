    "main_text": "The classical computational theory of mind\n3. The classical computational theory of mind\nWarren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) first suggested that\nsomething resembling the Turing machine might provide a good model for\nthe mind.  In the 1960s, Turing computation became central to the\nemerging interdisciplinary initiative cognitive science,\nwhich studies the mind by drawing upon psychology, computer science\n(especially AI), linguistics, philosophy, economics (especially game\ntheory and behavioral economics), anthropology, and neuroscience. The\nlabel classical computational theory of mind (which we will\nabbreviate as CCTM) is now fairly standard. According to CCTM, the\nmind is a computational system similar in important respects to a\nTuring machine, and core mental processes (e.g., reasoning,\ndecision-making, and problem solving) are computations similar in\nimportant respects to computations executed by a Turing machine. These\nformulations are imprecise. CCTM is best seen as a family of views,\nrather than a single well-defined\nview.[1]\nIt is common to describe CCTM as embodying \u201cthe computer\nmetaphor\u201d. This description is doubly misleading.\nFirst, CCTM is better formulated by describing the mind as a\n\u201ccomputing system\u201d or a \u201ccomputational system\u201d\nrather than a \u201ccomputer\u201d. As David Chalmers (2011) notes,\ndescribing a system as a \u201ccomputer\u201d strongly suggests that\nthe system is programmable. As Chalmers also notes, one need\nnot claim that the mind is programmable simply because one regards it\nas a Turing-style computational system. (Most Turing machines are not\nprogrammable.) Thus, the phrase \u201ccomputer metaphor\u201d\nstrongly suggests theoretical commitments that are inessential to\nCCTM.  The point here is not just terminological. Critics of CCTM\noften object that the mind is not a programmable general purpose\ncomputer (Churchland, Koch, and Sejnowski 1990). Since classical\ncomputationalists need not claim (and usually do not claim) that the\nmind is a programmable general purpose computer, the objection is\nmisdirected.\nSecond, CCTM is not intended metaphorically. CCTM does not simply\nhold that the mind is like a computing system. CCTM holds\nthat the mind literally is a computing system. Of course, the\nmost familiar artificial computing systems are made from silicon chips\nor similar materials, whereas the human body is made from flesh and\nblood. But CCTM holds that this difference disguises a more\nfundamental similarity, which we can capture through a Turing-style\ncomputational model. In offering such a model, we prescind from\nphysical details. We attain an abstract computational description that\ncould be physically implemented in diverse ways (e.g., through silicon\nchips, or neurons, or pulleys and levers). CCTM holds that a suitable\nabstract computational model offers a literally true description of\ncore mental processes.\nIt is common to summarize CCTM through the slogan \u201cthe mind\nis a Turing machine\u201d. This slogan is also somewhat misleading,\nbecause no one regards Turing\u2019s precise formalism as a plausible\nmodel of mental activity. The formalism seems too restrictive in\nseveral ways:\n\n Turing machines execute pure symbolic computation. The inputs and\noutputs are symbols inscribed in memory locations. In contrast, the\nmind receives sensory input (e.g., retinal stimulations) and\nproduces motor output (e.g., muscle activations). A complete\ntheory must describe how mental computation interfaces with sensory\ninputs and motor outputs.\n A Turing machine has infinite discrete memory capacity. Ordinary\nbiological systems have finite memory capacity. A plausible\npsychological model must replace the infinite memory store with a\nlarge but finite memory store\n Modern computers have random access memory: addressable\nmemory locations that the central processor can directly\naccess. Turing machine memory is not addressable. The central\nprocessor can access a location only by sequentially accessing\nintermediate locations. Computation without addressable memory is\nhopelessly inefficient. For that reason, C.R.  Gallistel and Adam King\n(2009) argue that addressable memory gives a better model of the mind\nthan non-addressable memory.\n A Turing machine has a central processor that\noperates serially, executing one instruction at a time. Other\ncomputational formalisms relax this assumption, allowing multiple\nprocessing units that operate in parallel. Classical\ncomputationalists can allow parallel computations (Fodor and Pylyshyn\n1988; Gallistel and King 2009: 174). See Gandy (1980) and Sieg (2009)\nfor general mathematical treatments that encompass both serial and\nparallel computation.\n Turing computation is deterministic: total computational\nstate determines subsequent computational state. One might instead\nallow stochastic computations. In a stochastic model, current\nstate does not dictate a unique next state. Rather, there is a certain\nprobability that the machine will transition from one state to\nanother.\n\nCCTM claims that mental activity is \u201cTuring-style\ncomputation\u201d, allowing these and other departures from\nTuring\u2019s own formalism.\n",
