    "main_text": "Ethics\n7. Science and Religion\n\nWhereas medieval and Renaissance authors often seemed to rely on the\ndouble-truth theory in order to maintain the freedom of scientific\nresearch and teaching, Telesio maintained a purely scientific\napproach. But he did not deny the existence of God and of the human\nsoul. Telesio\u2019s God is not the God who acts in nature and history,\nthough he did not deny the possibility of miracles (DRN book IV, ch.\nXXV; vol. I, p. 176). The God Telesio seems to imagine can be compared\nto a mechanic. Just as the best mechanic creates an artefact which\nwill work without interruption and default, so the power of the\nalmighty divine artist is represented in a cosmos which is able to\ngenerate and to sustain itself without ever running the danger of\ncorruption (see DRN book I, ch. X).\n\nBesides the natural soul or spirit Telesio accepted the existence of\nan immortal soul superimposed by God (DRN book V, ch. II\u2013III).\nBut in his theory of psychology and ethics the soul does not play any\nsignificant role, for which reason researchers have often held it to\nbe an addition designed to avoid conflicts with the Church. On the\nother hand, there do exist certain modes of behavior which cannot be\nexplained in a purely naturalistic and materialistic way, such as the\nhuman striving for eternity and the martyrs\u2019 denial of the highest\nobjective of self-preservation. But far from building a bridge to the\nphilosophical tradition, Telesio\u2019s definition of a second, divinely\nsuperimposed soul as \u201cforma corporis et praecipue\nspiritus\u201d deals a deathblow to Aristotle\u2019s teachings. According\nto Telesio, the idea of an immortal soul was totally unknown to the\nheathen Aristotle, who is severely criticized for confusing the\nconcept of a natural spirit with the religious idea of a soul (DRN\nbook V, ch. II\u2013III):\n\nAnd when we have reproved Aristotle and will continue to reprove him\nfor having introduced the soul into the body as its peculiar form, we\nhave not condemned him and we will not condemn him because he equated\nthe soul created by God (a thing which one might suspect was\ncompletely unknown to him) with the form of humans, but rather\nbecause... he equated the soul which was generated from the semen and\nwhich is the only one which senses, causes movements and is (so to\nspeak) something akin to the semen, with the form of the body. (Vol.\nII, p. 218f.)\n\n\nNonetheless, the few pages which Telesio dedicated to the immortal\nsoul do not open a path to metaphysical or theological theories. In\nscience, Telesio adheres to a naturalistic worldview. It was Tommaso\nCampanella who combined Telesian naturalism with a theory of the anima\ncreata and human mind which he based upon sceptical doubts. (Boenke\n2005, Ernst 2014, Bond\u00ec 2018).\n",
