    "main_text": "Early Work\n3. Early Work\n\nIn the years before World War I, \u0141ukasiewicz worked predominantly\non matters to do with the methodology of science. His doctorate,\npublished in 1903 as \u201cOn induction as the inverse of\ndeduction\u201d, investigated the relationship between the two forms\nof reasoning, in the light of work by Jevons, Sigwart and Erdmann.\nInductive reasoning, proceeding from singular empirical statements,\nattempts on his early view to reach a general conclusion to which a\ncertain probability can be ascribed. But he soon shifted to the view\nthat it is impossible to ascribe a determinate probability to a\ngeneral statement on the basis of induction. Rather the method of the\nempirical sciences is to creatively hazard the thought that a certain\ngeneralization is true, deduce singular conclusions from this, and\nthen see whether these are true. If one conclusion is not, then the\ngeneral statement is refuted. This, an early formulation of the\nhypothetico-deductive method of science, anticipates the ideas of\nPopper by more than two decades, though expressed less forcefully.\n\u0141ukasiewicz also anticipated Popper by stressing what he called\n\u201ccreative elements in science\u201d, against the idea that the\nscientist\u2019s task is to reproduce or replicate the facts.\n\nIn 1906 \u0141ukasiewicz published a substantial piece,\n\u201cAnalysis and construction of the concept of cause\u201d, which\ngained him his Habilitation in Lw\u00f3w. It is significant\nboth for its carefully argued method and for presaging themes that\nwere to occupy him later. Taking concepts platonistically as abstract\nobjects, \u0141ukasiewicz rejects psychological, subjective and\nregularity accounts of causality and accepts that cause and effect are\nlinked by necessity, which he identifies with logical necessity:\n\u201ca causal relation is a necessary relation, and the relative\nfeature [\u2026] due to which we call some object a cause, is the\nfeature \u2018entailing or bringing-about with\nnecessity\u2019.\u201d The piece\u2019s motto is Arceo\npsychologiam, \u201cReject psychology\u201d, marking a clear\nbreak with Twardowski and Brentano, while the logical analysis is\naimed at extracting the logical features of the notion of cause. It is\na clear example of what later came to be called \u2018analytic\nphilosophy\u2019, and shows \u0141ukasiewicz bringing logical\nconcepts to bear on scientifically central concepts, as he was later\nto do with his logical analysis of determinism.\n\nAn interest in probability lay behind one of \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\ntwo monographs published before the war, namely Logical\nFoundations of Probability Theory, which was written and\npublished not in Polish but in German. In 1908 and 1909\n\u0141ukasiewicz visited Graz where both Alexius Meinong and Ernst\nMally were also working on probability theory at this time, so it is\nlikely that the book was written in German because their language of\ndiscussion was German, and also in order to ensure a wider audience.\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s theory makes constructive use of ideas\nplucked from elsewhere: from Frege he took the idea of a truth-value,\nfrom Whitehead and Russell the idea of an indefinite proposition, and\nfrom Bolzano the idea of the ratio of true values to all values for a\nproposition. Consider the classical urn example, where an urn contains\nm black balls and n white balls. Let the indefinite\nproposition \u2018\\(x\\) is a black ball in this urn\u2019 be such\nthat the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 may take as value any expression\nnaming a ball in the urn: the variable is then said to range\nover the individual balls, and different expressions naming the\nsame ball to have the same value. (Note that \u0141ukasiewicz indeed\nuses the terminology, later associated with Quine, of a variable\ntaking values, here expressions, and ranging over objects designated\nby said expressions.) An indefinite proposition is said to be true if\nit yields a true proposition (\u0141ukasiewicz says\n\u2018judgement\u2019 for a definite proposition) for all values of\nits variables, it is false if it yields a false judgement for all\nvalues, and is neither true nor false if it yields true judgements for\nsome values and false judgements for others. The ratio true values/all\nvalues is then called by \u0141ukasiewicz the truth-value of\nthe indefinite proposition. For true indefinites it is 1, for false\nindefinites it is 0, and for others it is a rational number between 0\nand 1 (rational because only finite domains are considered). In our\nurn case the truth-value of the indefinite proposition\n\u2018x is a black ball in this urn\u2019 is\n\\(\\frac{m}{m+n}\\).\n\nOn this basis \u0141ukasiewicz develops a calculus of truth-values in\nwhich he can deal with logically complex propositions, conditional\nprobability, probabilistic independence, and derive Bayes\u2019\nTheorem. The calculus of truth-values is used as a logical\ntheory of probability, assisting us in our dealings with definite\nreality: \u0141ukasiewicz denies that there can be a theory either of\nobjective or of subjective probability as such. Two ideas from this\nshort but remarkable work are worth emphasizing because they resonate\nwith later ones of \u0141ukasiewicz. Firstly, there is the idea of a\nproposition (in this case an indefinite proposition) being neither\ntrue nor false; secondly, and connected with this, of such a\nproposition having a numerical truth-value properly between 0 (false)\nand 1 (true). \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s theory deserves to be better\nknown: it continues and extends earlier ideas of Bolzano, his\nprobability corresponding to the latter\u2019s degree of validity of\na proposition (with respect to variable components). Its chief\ndrawback is that it is formulated for finite domains only.\n\nOf all the works \u0141ukasiewicz published before World War I, one\nmost clearly anticipated his later concerns. This was the 1910\nmonograph On the Principle of Contradiction in Aristotle. It\nmarked a crucial turning point in the development of the\nLw\u00f3w-Warsaw school. For \u0141ukasiewicz it represented the\nfirst sustained questioning of the assumptions of traditional\nAristotelian logic.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz introduces the project of his monograph, a critical\ninvestigation of the legitimacy of the Principle of Contradiction (PC)\nas variously formulated by Aristotle, in the context of its critique\nby Hegel and the opportunity to re-examine the PC in the light of the\ndevelopment of mathematical logic from Boole to Russell.\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s sources for the post-Hegelian discussion of\nthe \u2018logical question\u2019 are Ueberweg, Trendelenburg and\nSigwart. A more local background was probably Twardowski\u2019s\naccount of the absolute and timeless nature of truth.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz distinguishes three different, non-equivalent\nversions of PC in Aristotle: an ontological version, a logical\nversion, and a psychological version, as follows:\n\nOntological (OPC): No object may at the same time possess and\nnot possess the same property.\n\nLogical (LPC): Contradictory statements are not\nsimultaneously true.\n\nPsychological (PPC): No one can simultaneously believe\ncontradictory things.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz criticises Aristotle for on the one hand claiming PC\ncannot be proved, and on the other hand attempting an indirect or\npragmatic \u201cproof\u201d. In partial agreement with the tradition\naccording to which PC is not the cornerstone or basic principle of\nlogic, \u0141ukasiewicz claims that its status is less secure than\nsome other logical propositions, and that its function is principally\nto serve as a pragmatic norm. Nevertheless, in an Appendix to the book\nhe gives a formal derivation of one version of PC from other\nassumptions. This shows that PC is as it were just one logical theorem\namong others, a statement that would raise few eyebrows today but was\nfairly radical in its day. Among the assumptions used in the\nderivation is a version of the Principle of Bivalence, that every\nproposition is either true or false and none is both, so the\nderivation of PC is not after all such a surprise.\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz described himself later as attempting in the\nmonograph to devise a \u201cnon-Aristotelian logic\u201d but admits\nthat he did not succeed, principally because at this stage he was not\nprepared to reject the principle of bivalence. It may well be\nMeinong\u2019s influence at work when \u0141ukasiewicz comes to give\nhis natural-language renderings of the symbolism of Couturat\u2019s\nalgebra of logic in the Appendix. There is little or no trace of the\npropositional logic that \u0141ukasiewicz was to make very much his\nown: the renderings are clumsily object-theoretic: the constant\n\u20180\u2019 for example, which might be naturally construed as a\nconstant false proposition (and is so in later \u0141ukasiewicz) is\nrendered as \u201cthe object that does not exist\u201d. This is one\nreason why \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s formal work in the Appendix to the\n1910 work appears relatively archaic. While the variable letters like\n\\(a, b\\) etc. \u201csignify affirmative statements\u201d and their\nnegations \\(a', b'\\) etc. \u201csignify negative statements\u201d,\nand in practice do work like propositional variables and their\nnegations in modern propositional logic, \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s\nrenderings of them are curiously hybrid: \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 is\nrendered as \u2018\\(X\\) contains \\(a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a'\\)\u2019 as \u2018\\(X\\) contains no \\(a\\)\u2019, while\n\u20181\u2019 signifies \u2018\\(X\\) is an object\u2019 and\n\u20180\u2019 signifies \u2018\\(X\\) is not an object\u2019. This\nis all very confused, and by no means a classical sentential logic in\nintent, even if it works like one in practice.\n\nWhile not in itself a success, the book shows \u0141ukasiewicz on the\nthreshold of his later logical breakthroughs. It was read in 1911 by\nthe young Le\u015bniewski, who sought against \u0141ukasiewicz to\nprove OPC, and who first introduced himself in 1912 on\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s doorstep with the words, \u201cI am\nLe\u015bniewski, and I have come to show you the proofs of an article\nI have written against you.\u201d The book also contains a brief\ndiscussion of Russell\u2019s Paradox, and it was reading this that\ninspired Le\u015bniewski to become a logician, intent on providing a\nparadox-free logical foundation for mathematics. The book promoted\nfurther discussion in Lw\u00f3w: Kotarbi\u0144ski wrote in defense\nof Aristotle\u2019s idea, discussed by \u0141ukasiewicz, that a\nstatement about future contingent events may lack a truth-value before\nthe event and only gain one afterwards, while Le\u015bniewski wrote in\nopposition to this and brought Kotarbi\u0144ski round to his own view\n(which agreed with earlier views of Twardowski and later ones of\nTarski) that truth is timeless, or as Le\u015bniewski expressed it,\nboth eternal and sempiternal. \u0141ukasiewicz was soon to side with\nthe earlier Kotarbi\u0144ski, and in so doing to make his most famous\ndiscovery, that of many-valued logic.\n",
