    "main_text": "Preference change || Valuational preference change\n8. Preference criticism\n\nIn scholarly discussions, preferences are usually taken to be open to\nrational criticism only insofar as (i) they have been inconsistent,\nviolating some of the rationally justifiable preference axioms, or\n(ii) they (in combination with beliefs) commit the agent to\ninconsistent inferences. \n\nCan there be rationally justifiable claims that certain\nintrinsic preferences \u2013 i.e. preferences that are not\ndependent on other preferences \u2013 are wrong, or should be\nchanged? The Humean position answers no. Hume distinguished reason\nfrom the passion, and argued \u201cthat reason alone can never be a\nmotive to any action of the will; that it can never oppose passion in\nthe direction of the will\u201d (Treatise, Book II, Part\nIII, Section III). Humeans often took this distinction between beliefs\nand desires to imply not only that beliefs alone cannot motivate\naction, but also that desires are not open to similar rational\ncriticism as beliefs. Therefore, Humeans conclude, preferences can\nonly be criticised if they are extrinsic \u2013 i.e.\ninstrumentally derived from other preferences on the basis of beliefs\n\u2013 or inconsistent. Such criticism of extrinsic preferences would\nseem ultimately to be a criticism of false beliefs, and it could be\nargued that it is therefore not really criticism of preferences\n(Broome 1993). \n\nSeveral authors have argued for a more substantial criticism of\npreferences, including that of intrinsic ones. Some critics argue that\nsome or all preferences are in fact a kind of belief, and hence open\nto the same rational criticism as beliefs. Two defences have been\npresented to counter this challenge. First, it has been claimed that\nthat desires (standing for motivation in general) are fundamentally\ndistinct from epistemic states in their direction of fit.\nBeliefs are directed to fit the world; hence their insufficient fit\nprovides the basis for their criticism. Desires are directed to fit\nthe world to them; hence they lack this basis for criticism (Smith\n1987). Second, Humeans have argued that treating desires as beliefs is\nincompatible with Bayesian decision theory and also with other,\nnon-quantitative, decision theories (Lewis 1988, Collins 1991,\nByrne/Hajek 1997). \n\nSome proponents of the criticizability of preferences have referred to\nsecond-order preferences. An addict may prefer not to prefer smoking;\na malevolent person may prefer not to prefer evil actions; an indolent\nmay prefer not to prefer to shun work; a daydreamer may prefer not to\nprefer what cannot be realised, etc. First-order preferences are\ncriticisable if they do not comply with second-order preferences. (For\naccounts of second-order preferences, see Frankfurt 1971, Sen 1977.)\nSecond-order preferences may trigger attempts to change one\u2019s\npreferences. Methods of self-restraint, self-command and\nself-improvement have been extensively described (Schelling 1984,\nElster 1989, 2000). Already Hume described the possibility of\nrationally choosing such expedience (Gr\u00fcne-Yanoff & McClennen\n2006). \n\nCritics have argued against the possibility of rationally choosing\nsuch indirect preference-modifying strategies. Millgram (1998) argues\nthat knowledge of the way such desires-at-will were brought about\nmakes it impossible for them to actually function as the desires they\nare intended to be. He gives the example of a car salesman, who, in\norder to be successful in his work, makes himself prefer the various\nuseless knick-knacks that the brand he represents offers for its cars.\nWhen the salesman is laid off, the car-dealer offers him a car with\nall the useless extras that he made himself prefer. Because he\nremembers how he acquired these preferences, he chooses not to act on\nthem. So, Millgram argues, the desire-at-will was not genuine. What is\nmissing, he points out, are the backward-directed inferential\ncommitments that genuine preferences bring with them. Only if one\nforgets that one acquired a specific preference at will, or if one\nalso acquires the inferential commitments of such a preference, can\npreferring-at-will be successful. \n",
