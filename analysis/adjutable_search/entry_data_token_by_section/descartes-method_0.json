The Origins and Definition of Descartes\u2019 Method\n\nThe origins of Descartes\u2019 method are coeval with his initiation\ninto a radical form of natural philosophy based on the combination of\nmechanics, physics, and mathematics, a combination Aristotle\nproscribed and that remained more or less absent in the history of\nscience before the seventeenth century (on the relation between\nmechanics, physics, and mathematics in medieval science, see Duhem\n1905\u20131906, 1906\u20131913, 1913\u20131959; Maier\n1949\u20131958; Clagett 1959; Crombie 1961; Sylla 1991; Laird and\nRoux 2008). Descartes first learned how to combine these arts and\nsciences from the Dutch scientist and polymath Isaac Beeckman\n(1588\u20131637), whom he met in 1619 while stationed in Breda as a\nsoldier in the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau (see Rodis-Lewis 1998:\n24\u201349 and Clarke 2006: 37\u201367). Beeckman described his form\nof natural philosophy as \u201cphysico-mathematics\u201d (see AT 10:\n67\u201377 and Schuster 2013), and the two men discussed and\ncorresponded about problems in mathematics and natural philosophy,\nincluding problems in the theory of music, hydrostatics, and the\ndynamics of falling bodies (see AT 10: 46\u201347, 51\u201363,\n67\u201374, 75\u201378, 89\u2013141, 331\u2013348; Shea 1991:\n1\u2013121; Damerow et al. 1992; Schuster 2013: 99\u2013167).\n\nWhile it is difficult to determine when Descartes composed his\nprincipal methodological treatise, Rules for the Direction of the\nMind (Regulae ad directionem ingenii), it is widely believed that\nhe composed the Rules in the 1620s (see Weber 1964:\n194\u2013207; Gaukroger 1995: 104\u2013187; Schuster 2013:\n307\u2013349). More recent evidence suggests that Descartes may have\ncontinued working on the Rules after 1628 (see Descartes ES). Rules contains the most detailed description of\nDescartes\u2019 method anywhere in his corpus. However, he never\ncompleted it, and he never explicitly refers to it anywhere in his\npublished writings or correspondence. \n\nDescartes defines \u201cmethod\u201d in Rule 4 as a set of \n\n\nreliable rules which are easy to apply, and such that if one follows\nthem exactly, one will never take what is false to be true or\nfruitlessly expend one\u2019s mental efforts, but will gradually and\nconstantly increase one\u2019s knowledge till one arrives at a true\nunderstanding of everything within one\u2019s capacity. (AT 10:\n371\u2013372, CSM 1: 16) \n\n\nHe divides the Rules into three principal parts: Rules\n1\u201312 deal with the definition of science, the principal\noperations of the method (intuition, deduction, and enumeration), and what Descartes terms \u201csimple propositions\u201d, which \u201coccur to us spontaneously\u201d and which are objects of certain and evident cognition or intuition (e.g., \u201ca triangle is bounded by just three lines\u201d) (see AT 10: 428, CSM 1: 50; AT 10: 368, CSM 1: 14).\nRules 13\u201324 deal with what Descartes terms \u201cperfectly\nunderstood problems\u201d, or problems in which all of the conditions\nrelevant to the solution of the problem are known, and which arise principally in\narithmetic and geometry (see AT 10: 429\u2013430, CSM 1: 51); Rules\n25\u201336 deal with \u201cimperfectly understood problems\u201d,\nor problems in which one or more conditions relevant to the solution of the problem are not\nknown, but must be found. These problems arise for the most part in\nnatural philosophy and metaphysics. The Rules end prematurely\nat Rule 21 (see AT 10: 428\u2013430, CSM 1: 50\u201351).\n",
