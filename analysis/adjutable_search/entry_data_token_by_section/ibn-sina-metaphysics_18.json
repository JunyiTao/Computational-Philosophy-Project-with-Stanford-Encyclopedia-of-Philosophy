    "main_text": "Causality and Cosmology || Celestial Movement\n5.5 Celestial Movement\n\nThe explanation of celestial movement elaborates and alters some of\nAristotle\u2019s (and al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\u2019s) ideas.\nIntelligences and souls together explain\u2014as remote and proximate\ncauses respectively\u2014the motion of the spheres, as they are at\nthe root of the influence (ta\u02bea\u1e6f\u1e6fur ) the\nspheres have on the sublunary world. Metaphysics explains\ncosmology\u2014to which it is linked\u2014but also adopts its data.\nThus the circular movement of the spheres is explained by Avicenna not\ndirectly by means of nature\u2014celestial bodies always leave the\nspot they have just attained only to return to occupy it again later,\nwhereas through natural movement a body should come to rest in its\nlocus naturalis\u2014but by means of a principle which is\nboth intellectual and psychic (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2,\n382, 8\u2013383, 13): the motion of the spheres is a reflection of\nthe love and desire (\u02bfi\u0161q and\nta\u0161awwuq; Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 387,\n1\u2013392, 3), common to both intelligences and souls, to resemble\ntheir principle (to realize their\nassimilation\u2014ta\u0161abbuh\u2014to it). It is\nbecause of this desired resemblance that celestial bodies actualize,\nby occupying all their possible positions in turn, the only\npotentiality they have (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 389,\n13\u2013390, 8; Hasnawi 1984; Janos 2011). In other words, celestial\nsouls continuously move the bodies to which they are bound in order to\nrealize this resemblance: each time they have before them the\nrepresentation of a point they must reach by virtue of which\nimperfection will, however briefly, be eliminated; in a way that is in\npart irrational, each time every soul chooses one point rather than\nanother (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 383, 10\u201311).\n\nThe movement of the spheres is thus explained by combining nature,\nsoul and intelligence. Indeed, the soul follows nature\n(Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 383, 7\u201313; in a sense,\nsince it is not opposed to the potentiality of the body, celestial\nmotion could be defined as natural), but is also thought and will.\nOnly an intellectual discursive will, which is capable of a particular\nintellection, can explain the celestial movement by which the body is\nalways located in a particularly determined position: the soul\nconceives and therefore elects and desires a movement whose status (to\nleave a point in order to return to it and then leave it again as in a\ncycle) is rightly expressed by a paradox: celestial movement is\n\u201cpersistence itself\u201d (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 3,\n398, 2\u20137). In fact, intelligences guarantee the infinity of\nmotion because their thought is oriented towards the Principle; every\nintelligence moves because it looks to the Principle as to its object\nof love and assimilation and consequently receives from It an infinite\nlight (Il\u0101hiyy\u0101t, IX, 2, 389, 10\u201313),\nwhile\u2014as we have observed (see\n Section 2.3)\u2014the\n First Principle is not a direct but a transcendent principle of\nmotion: it is the ultimate horizon to which the intelligences look\nwith their desire for resemblance.\n",
