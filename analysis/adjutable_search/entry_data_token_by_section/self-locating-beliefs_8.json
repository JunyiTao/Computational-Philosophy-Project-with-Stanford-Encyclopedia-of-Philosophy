    "main_text": "Theoretical Responses || Belief states\n3.2 Belief states\n\nPerry recommends that instead of complicating our picture of the\nobjects of belief, we complicate our picture of the belief relation.\nOn Perry\u2019s view, a proper doxastic theory focuses not just on\nthe propositions to which we stand in the belief relation, but also on\nthe mechanisms by which we come to be belief-related to those\npropositions.\n\nPerry\u2019s solution emphasizes that once we\u2019re externalists\nabout belief content, determination of what we believe is a two-part\naffair: Which propositions we\u2019re belief-related to depends\npartially on what we\u2019re like intrinsically, and partially on how\nwe\u2019re situated in our environment.\n\nSome of our states\u2014in particular, states of our internal\nmechanisms of mental representation\u2014determine not what we\nbelieve, but instead a function from environments to things believed.\nPerry calls these belief-states. Belief-states are\nindividuated by something like Kaplanian characters (Kaplan\n1989)\u2014functions from environments (contexts) to propositions a\nbeliever would be belief-related to if they were in that state in that\nenvironment.\n\nWhile this is deliberately not built into the theory,\nit\u2019s natural (and sometimes heuristically helpful) to think of\nbelief-states in terms of tokenings of language-of-thought sentences\nwith context-sensitive elements. (More generally, it\u2019s natural\nto think of them as particular patterns of deployment of one\u2019s\ninternal representational apparatus.)\n\nAccording to Perry, what\u2019s distinctive about distinctively\nself-locating beliefs is a particular sort of belief-state\u2014a\nbelief-state that belief-relates agents to different propositions in\ndifferent contexts. Instead of focusing our theoretical attention\nexclusively on which propositions subjects believe, we focus also on\nwhich belief-states they\u2019re in. And it\u2019s at the level of\nbelief-states that we find the tools for accommodating cases that make\ntrouble for the Simple Picture.\n\nTo explain how Perry\u2019s view addresses difficulties for the\nSimple Picture, we need a way of talking about belief-states. Perry\nuses English sentences to talk about belief-states, by indexing\nbelief-states to English sentences with the same\ncharacter\u2014English sentences displaying the same pattern of\ndependence of content on context as the belief-states. So the\nbelief-state corresponding to \u201cI am the messy shopper\u201d is\nthe belief-state such that, for any subject x who is in that\nstate, x is thereby belief-related to the proposition\nthat x is the messy shopper.\n\nOn this view, what\u2019s missing in ignorance cases isn\u2019t a\nbelief, but a belief-state. When Perry realizes what\u2019s happening\nin the supermarket, he doesn\u2019t (at least, he needn\u2019t) come\nto believe any new propositions, but he does come to be in a new\nbelief-state. He comes to be in the \u201cI am the messy\nshopper\u201d state, and thereby believes the proposition that\nPerry is the messy shopper. (He may have already had a belief\nwith that content, but if so it will have been in virtue of being in a\ndifferent belief-state.) It\u2019s a change in belief-state, not just\na change (if any) in propositions believed, that\u2019s responsible\nfor Perry\u2019s changed behavior.\n\nAnother example to illustrate the idea: Gennaro looks in a mirror,\nthinking he\u2019s looking through a window, and sees flames creeping\nup the pants leg of the person he sees in the glass. At first he says,\n\u201cthat guy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d, and is in the\n\u201cthat guy\u2019s pants are on fire\u201d belief-state. He\nthereby comes to believe the traditional proposition that\nGennaro\u2019s pants are on fire. Then he realizes what\u2019s\nhappening, and comes to be in the \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d\nbelief-state. There\u2019s no change in which propositions he\nbelieves\u2014he\u2019s still belief-related to the traditional\nproposition that Gennaro\u2019s pants are on fire. But\nbecause he\u2019s now belief-related to that proposition by way of\nthe \u201cmy pants are on fire\u201d belief-state, his behavior\nchanges.\n\nThe difference in difference cases isn\u2019t a difference in\npropositions believed, but in belief-states. John and David are both\nbelief-related to the proposition that David is witnessing\nJohn\u2019s being attacked by a bear. But the belief-states that\nsupport their being belief-related to that proposition are different.\nDavid is in (for example) the \u201cI am witnessing that guy\u2019s\nbeing attacked by a bear\u201d belief-state, while John is in the\n\u201cthat guy is witnessing my being attacked by a bear\u201d\nbelief-state. This difference in belief-states generates the\ndifferences in their behavior.\n\nWhat\u2019s the same in sameness cases is a belief-state, not a\nproposition believed. When Gennaro and Hector both exclaim, \u201cmy\npants are on fire\u201d, and engage in similar associated behavior,\nit\u2019s because they are both in the \u201cmy pants are on\nfire\u201d belief-state. Being in that belief-state gets them\nbelief-related to different propositions. It relates Gennaro to the\nproposition that Gennaro\u2019s pants are on fire, while it\nrelates Hector to the proposition that Hector\u2019s pants are on\nfire. So the similarity is to be found at the level of\nbelief-states, not at the level of propositions believed.\n",
