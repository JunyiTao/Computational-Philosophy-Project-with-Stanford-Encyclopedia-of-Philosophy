Meritocratic Equality of Opportunity\n\nTo this point, conceptions of Equality of Opportunity have been\narranged according to the factors which are identified as\ninappropriate determinants of people\u2019s prospects for success. By\nimplication this leaves open which further factors should in fact\ndetermine who succeeds in a competition or who obtains a good. There\nis an influential way of conceiving of Equality of Opportunity which\nincludes the aforementioned conditions on Equality of\nOpportunity\u2014no legal barriers, no formal exclusion,\nanti-discrimination protections\u2014but also adds the requirement\nthat applicants for a position be selected according to who is best\nqualified. Equality of Opportunity, thus understood, requires both\nthat the competition for positions and advantages is open in the\nrelevant ways, and also that the criteria for successful pursuit\nshould be governed by whatever it is which makes competitors best\nqualified to perform a role (James Fishkin 1983; Flew 1981; Daniels\n1978; Mason 2001; Miller 1999: chs. 7\u20139; Sher 1988). This might\nbe termed a \u201cmeritocratic\u201d conception of Equality of\nOpportunity inasmuch this conception requires that persons be judged\non their \u201cmerits\u201d in relation to the post they are\ncompeting for, although it is worth noting that the label\n\u201cmeritocratic\u201d is itself deployed differently in different\nwork. This idea of an open competition, in which success is determined\nby one\u2019s qualifications for a role, is also sometimes referred\nto as \u201ccareers open to talents\u201d. It is worth recalling\nhere that there can be telic or deontic versions of the meritocratic\nconception. Although the notion of the \u201cbest qualified\u201d\nlends itself most naturally to deontic principles concerning the\nappropriate selection criteria for positions, it is coherent to make\njudgements about a meritocratic society overall, and to consider how\nfar people\u2019s prospects overall are determined by their merit as\nopposed to other factors.\n\nThe relationship between formal Equality of Opportunity, as elaborated\nabove, and meritocratic Equality of Opportunity is contested.\nRadcliffe Richards (1997: 260\u2013263), for instance, argues that\nthe two ideas are radically discontinuous and do not have any\nnecessary implications for one another. On the other hand, Mason\n(2006: 29\u201332) argues that it is hard to establish what counts as\nunfair discrimination under the formal view without some account of\nwhat makes something a legitimate qualification, which leads us\ntowards a meritocratic view.\n\nThere are several further things to note about the meritocratic\nconception of Equality of Opportunity. First, there is nothing in the\nmeritocratic view which entails distribution via free market\nmechanisms, even though such a view is commonly associated with the\nfree market. It is consistent to conceive of a centrally planned\ndistribution of social positions which is governed by best qualified\ncriteria (Mason 2006: 20). Indeed, an unregulated free market may\nquite conceivably involve violations of meritocratic Equality of\nOpportunity if firms discriminate against some applicants. It might be\ntempting to think that a free market naturally tilts towards adopting\na meritocratic conception of Equality of Opportunity, given that firms\nin the market will be incentivized to hire employees who will best\nserve firms\u2019 interests. This is predicated on at least two\nfurther suppositions which may not necessarily be true. First, that\nthe \u201cbest qualified\u201d candidate under a meritocratic view\nwill in fact generally best serve the firm\u2019s interest. Second,\nthat firms generally make rational hiring decisions, or at least will\nbe forced to make rational hiring decisions over time.\n\nIndeed, there are a range of further complexities which means that it\nis not straightforwardly true that the \u201cbest qualified\u201d\ncandidate is the same as the candidate which best advances a\nfirm\u2019s interest. For one thing, there are different ways of\nthinking about the value of an open competition which selects the best\nqualified. On one meritocratic conception of Equality of Opportunity,\nwhat matters is whether a position is filled with the best qualified\ncandidate, rather than this being done through an \u201copen\ncompetition\u201d. It would be consistent with this view to headhunt\nparticular individuals for roles if this were more efficient at\nidentifying the best qualified. This might still be considered an open\ncompetition under Equality of Opportunity inasmuch as there were no\nrelevant constraints on others becoming the best qualified (and then\nbeing headhunted). On a different meritocratic conception, though,\nthere is a reason to value an open competition, even if that will\nsometimes result in a less well-qualified candidate being selected,\nbecause doing so putatively gives potential candidates a relevantly\nfair chance at attaining the position. The difference between these\nviews, at bottom, is how far one values Equality of Opportunity for\nthe outcomes it delivers (the best qualified attaining the positions)\nas compared with the procedures it instantiates (the opportunities\nafforded to all to attain the position under a best qualified\nselection criteria). Both outcome and procedural oriented versions of\nthe meritocratic conceptions of Equality of Opportunity are consistent\nwith condemning certain kinds of profiling, even when profiling would\nbe a rational way of furthering a firm\u2019s interest (for a survey\nof reasons to be troubled by statistical discrimination of this kind,\nsee Lippert-Rasmussen 2007). For instance, suppose data supported the\nconclusion that appealing to sex or racialized group membership was a\ngood proxy for performance in a certain role, and that a firm could\nmake substantial efficiency savings in the hiring process by using\nsuch a proxy. A procedural version of meritocratic Equality of\nOpportunity might naturally condemn this form of profiling as\ninconsistent with a relevantly open competition for the position,\ngiven that potentially qualified individuals are disadvantaged using\nthe proxy. But even an outcome-oriented version has scope for\ncondemning the profiling, either on the grounds that it violates a\nmoral side-constraint, or on the grounds that it remains imperfect at\nidentifying the best qualified (even if it is more efficient than\nother alternatives).\n\nFurthermore, it may be morally troubling for an employer to take into\naccount certain employee characteristics, even when those\ncharacteristics render an employee \u201cbetter qualified\u201d for\na role in a way that serves the employer\u2019s interest. Consider a\nrestaurant owner seeking to hire a new waiter. The restaurant owner\nwants to appoint the candidate who is the best qualified according to\ncriteria which include being punctual, diligent, honest, and likely to\npromote repeat custom amongst the clientele, with the latter being\noverwhelmingly important. Suppose, however, that the restaurant is in\nan area rife with racist prejudice against members of certain\nracialized minority groups and that members of those groups are held\nin contempt by the majority of the local population, who constitute\nthe vast majority of the restaurant clientele. Though the restaurant\nowner does not harbour any racial prejudice themselves, they also know\nthat hiring a racialized minority will positively undermine repeat\ncustom. An antidiscrimination principle, which prohibits directly\ndiscriminating against applicants on racialized grounds, seems to be\nin tension with an unmodified meritocratic principle that requires\nappointing the best qualified in this sense. Any racialized minority\nindividual will be less \u201cwell-qualified\u201d, given the racial\nprejudice present in the local community. In this way, norms and\npreferences which would be inadmissible to directly consider might\nnevertheless filter through to determine who is successful in the\ncompetition by determining who satisfies the \u201cbest\nqualified\u201d criteria.\n\nBecause such qualifications\u2014like the ability to encourage repeat\ncustom\u2014depend on the reactions of recipients of a service, they\nare sometimes referred to as \u201creaction\u201d qualifications\n(Alexander 1992; Lippert-Rasmussen 2009; Lippert-Rasmussen 2014: ch.\n9; Mason 2017; Wertheimer 1983). Many reaction qualifications will\nappear quite unproblematic. For instance, a department store might\nwant to hire customer-facing staff that are considered polite, or a\ncomedy club might want to hire acts that punters find funny. However,\nexamples such as the case of the racist local community cast doubt on\nwhether this is true of all reaction qualifications and raise the\nquestion as to which kinds of reactions are legitimate to take into\naccount and which are not (Lippert-Rasmussen 2009; Mason 2017). The\nspectre of morally suspect reaction qualifications is a further\nindication that the relationship between firms\u2019 interests and a\nmeritocratic conception of Equality of Opportunity might not be\nstraightforward.\n\nMore generally, it is worth remembering that the meritocratic\nconception of Equality of Opportunity\u2014an open competition\nselecting the best qualified\u2014does not itself tell us which\npositions should exist in society; what makes someone \u201cbest\nqualified\u201d for those positions; and how those positions should\nbe rewarded. Nothing in the meritocratic conception, for instance,\ntells us which jobs should be available and at what levels of\ndifferential reward. Indeed, although the meritocratic conception\ntends to be seen as a justification for inequalities, it is\ntechnically consistent with a meritocratic conception of Equality of\nOpportunity that different social positions do not offer differential\nlevels of reward.\n\nMoreover, just as the meritocratic conception is consistent with\nnon-free market allocation of positions, it is also consistent with\npositions in society being organized in a range of different ways,\nprovided the selection for those positions is open to all and filled\naccording to the best qualified criteria. Suppose we have a factory\nproduction line with a number of workstations which each require very\ndifferent skills to operate. The first requires heavy lifting, the\nsecond requires quick thinking, the third requires manual dexterity,\nthe fourth requires attention to detail. There are different ways in\nwhich working practices could be organized amongst employees. One\noption would be to have each employee specialize in working only one\nstation. Another option would be to have each employee work each\nstation for a period of several weeks and then rotate to work another\nstation for several weeks and so on. A further option would be to have\nemployees work each of the stations throughout the day, so that they\nfollowed the good they are producing and worked with it at each\nstation. The meritocratic conception is indifferent as to how the\nfactory work practices are organized, provided the employees are\nselected under an open competition according to their qualifications.\nYet which workplace practices are adopted may have significant\nimplications for whom it is appropriate to select as an employee. The\nfirst option may favour selecting those who are adept at specializing\nin one of the relevant workplace tasks; the second option may favour\nselecting those who are versatile in the sense that they are able to\nacquire a number of different skills; the third option may favour\nselecting those who are adaptable in the sense that they are able to\nefficiently shift between different tasks during the same process. The\nsame is true when it comes to the structure of society as a whole,\nsuch that which positions are available will have profound\nimplications for who has the best chance to attain them (for critiques\nwhich emphasize these factors, see Markovits 2019; Sandel 2020). And\nthere will be a further question with respect to level of reward\ndifferent positions ought to be given. Because meritocratic Equality\nof Opportunity, thus understood, is silent on these further questions\nconcerning how society should be organized, and how far persons should\nhave an equal opportunity to become the best qualified, it is\nregarded by some as a relatively limited component of the justice of\nsociety as a whole.\n",
