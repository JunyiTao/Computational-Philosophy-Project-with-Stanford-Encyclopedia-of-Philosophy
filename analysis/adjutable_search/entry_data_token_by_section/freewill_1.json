After less sustained attention\nin the 19th Century (most notable were Schopenhauer 1841 [1999] and\nNietzsche 1886 [1966]), it was widely discussed again among early\ntwentieth century philosophers (Moore 1912; Hobart 1934; Schlick 1939;\nNowell-Smith 1948, 1954; Campbell 1951; Ayer 1954; Smart 1961). The\ncentrality of the problem of free will to the various projects of\nearly modern philosophers can be traced to two widely, though not\nuniversally, shared assumptions. The first is that without belief in\nfree will, there would be little reason for us to act morally. More\ncarefully, it was widely assumed that belief in an afterlife in which\na just God rewards and punishes us according to our right or wrong use\nof free will was key to motivating us to be moral (Russell 2008, chs.\n16\u201317). Life before death affords us many examples in which vice\nis better rewarded than virtue and so without knowledge of a final\njudgment in the afterlife, we would have little reason to pursue\nvirtue and justice when they depart from self-interest. And without\nfree will there can be no final judgement.\n\nThe second widely shared assumption is that free will seems difficult\nto reconcile with what we know about the world. While this assumption\nis shared by the majority of early modern philosophers, what\nspecifically it is about the world that seems to conflict with freedom\ndiffers from philosopher to philosopher. For some, the worry is\nprimarily theological. How can we make sense of contingency and\nfreedom in a world determined by a God who must choose the best\npossible world to create? For some, the worry was primarily\nmetaphysical. The principle of sufficient reason\u2014roughly, the\nidea that every event must have a reason or cause\u2014was a\ncornerstone of Leibniz\u2019s and Spinoza\u2019s metaphysics. How\ndoes contingency and freedom fit into such a world? For some, the\nworry was primarily scientific (Descartes). Given that a proper\nunderstanding of the physical world is one in which all physical\nobjects are governed by deterministic laws of nature, how does\ncontingency and freedom fit into such a world? Of course, for some,\nall three worries were in play in their work (this is true especially\nof Leibniz).\n\nDespite many disagreements about how best to solve these worries,\nthere were three claims that were widely, although not universally,\nagreed upon. The first was that free will has two aspects: the freedom\nto do otherwise and the power of self-determination. The second is\nthat an adequate account of free will must entail that free agents are\nmorally responsible agents and/or fit subjects for punishment. Ideas\nabout moral responsibility were often a yard stick by which analyses\nof free will were measured, with critics objecting to an analysis of\nfree will by arguing that agents who satisfied the analysis would not,\nintuitively, be morally responsible for their actions. The third is\nthat compatibilism\u2014the thesis that free will is compatible with\ndeterminism\u2014is true. (Spinoza, Reid, and Kant are the clear\nexceptions to this, though some also see Descartes as an\nincompatibilist [Ragland 2006].)\n\nSince a detailed discussion of these philosophers\u2019 accounts of\nfree will would take us too far afield, we want instead to focus on\nisolating a two-step strategy for defending compatibilism that emerges\nin the early modern period and continued to exert considerable force\ninto the early twentieth century (and perhaps is still at work today).\nAdvocates of this two-step strategy have come to be known as\n\u201cclassical compatibilists\u201d. The first step was to argue\nthat the contrary of freedom is not determinism but external\nconstraint on doing what one wants to do. For example, Hobbes contends\nthat liberty is \u201cthe absence of all the impediments to action\nthat are not contained in the nature and intrinsical quality of the\nagent\u201d (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 38; cf. Hume 1748 [1975] VIII.1;\nEdwards 1754 [1957]; Ayer 1954). This idea led many compatibilists,\nespecially the more empiricist-inclined, to develop desire- or\npreference-based analyses of both the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination. An agent has the freedom to do otherwise than\n\\(\\phi\\) just in case if she preferred or willed to\ndo otherwise, she would have done otherwise (Hobbes 1654 [1999], 16;\nLocke 1690 [1975]) II.xx.8; Hume 1748 [1975] VIII.1; Moore 1912; Ayer\n1954). The freedom to do otherwise does not require that you are able\nto act contrary to your strongest motivation but simply that your\naction be dependent on your strongest motivation in the sense that\nhad you desired something else more strongly, then you would\nhave pursued that alternative end. (We will discuss this analysis in\nmore detail below in section 2.2.) Similarly, an agent self-determines\nher \\(\\phi\\)-ing just in case \\(\\phi\\) is caused by her strongest\ndesires or preferences at the time of action (Hobbes\n1654 [1999]; Locke 1690 [1975]; Edwards 1754 [1957]). (We will discuss\nthis analysis in more detail below in section 2.4.) Given these\nanalyses, determinism seems innocuous to freedom.\n\nThe second step was to argue that any attempt to analyze free will in\na way that putatively captures a deeper or more robust sense of\nfreedom leads to intractable conundrums. The most important examples\nof this attempt to capture a deeper sense of freedom in the modern\nperiod are Immanuel Kant (1781 [1998], 1785 [1998], 1788 [2015]) and\nThomas Reid (1788 [1969]) and in the early twentieth century C. A.\nCampbell (1951). These philosophers argued that the above\ncompatibilist analyses of the freedom to do otherwise and\nself-determination are, at best, insufficient for free will, and, at\nworst, incompatible with it. With respect to the classical\ncompatibilist analysis of the freedom to do otherwise, these critics\nargued that the freedom to do otherwise requires not just that an\nagent could have acted differently if he had willed\ndifferently, but also that he could have willed differently.\nFree will requires more than free action. With respect to classical\ncompatibilists\u2019 analysis of self-determination, they argued that\nself-determination requires that the agent\u2014rather than his\ndesires, preferences, or any other mental state\u2014cause his free\nchoices and actions. Reid explains:\n\n\nI consider the determination of the will as an effect. This effect\nmust have a cause which had the power to produce it; and the cause\nmust be either the person himself, whose will it is, or some other\nbeing\u2026. If the person was the cause of that determination of\nhis own will, he was free in that action, and it is justly imputed to\nhim, whether it be good or bad. But, if another being was the cause of\nthis determination, either producing it immediately, or by means and\ninstruments under his direction, then the determination is the act and\ndeed of that being, and is solely imputed to him. (1788 [1969] IV.i,\n265)\n\n\nClassical compatibilists argued that both claims are incoherent. While\nit is intelligible to ask whether a man willed to do what he did, it\nis incoherent to ask whether a man willed to will what he did:\n\n\nFor to ask whether a man is at liberty to will either motion or rest,\nspeaking or silence, which he pleases, is to ask whether a man can\nwill what he wills, or be pleased with what he is\npleased with? A question which, I think, needs no answer; and they who\nmake a question of it must suppose one will to determine the acts of\nanother, and another to determine that, and so on in\ninfinitum. (Locke 1690 [1975] II.xx.25; cf. Hobbes 1656 [1999],\n72)\n\n\nIn response to libertarians\u2019 claim that self-determination\nrequires that the agent, rather than his motives, cause his actions,\nit was objected that this removes the agent from the natural causal\norder, which is clearly unintelligible for human animals (Hobbes 1654\n[1999], 38). It is important to recognize that an implication of the\nsecond step of the strategy is that free will is not only compatible\nwith determinism but actually requires determinism (cf. Hume 1748\n[1975] VIII). This was a widely shared assumption among compatibilists\nup through the mid-twentieth century.\n\nSpinoza\u2019s Ethics (1677 [1992]) is an important\ndeparture from the above dialectic. He endorses a strong form of\nnecessitarianism in which everything is categorically necessary as\nopposed to the conditional necessity embraced by most compatibilists,\nand he contends that there is no room in such a world for divine or\ncreaturely free will. Thus, Spinoza is a free will skeptic.\nInterestingly, Spinoza is also keen to deny that the nonexistence of\nfree will has the dire implications often assumed. As noted above,\nmany in the modern period saw belief in free will and an afterlife in\nwhich God rewards the just and punishes the wicked as necessary to\nmotivate us to act morally. According to Spinoza, so far from this\nbeing necessary to motivate us to be moral, it actually distorts our\npursuit of morality. True moral living, Spinoza thinks, sees virtue as\nits own reward (Part V, Prop. 42). Moreover, while free will is a\nchimera, humans are still capable of freedom or self-determination.\nSuch self-determination, which admits of degrees on Spinoza\u2019s\nview, arises when our emotions are determined by true ideas about the\nnature of reality. The emotional lives of the free persons are ones in\nwhich \u201cwe desire nothing but that which must be, nor, in an\nabsolute sense, can we find contentment in anything but truth. And so\nin so far as we rightly understand these matters, the endeavor of the\nbetter part of us is in harmony with the order of the whole of\nNature\u201d (Part IV, Appendix). Spinoza is an important forerunner\nto the many free will skeptics in the twentieth century, a position\nthat continues to attract strong support (see Strawson 1986; Double\n1992; Smilansky 2000; Pereboom 2001, 2014; Levy 2011; Waller 2011;\nCaruso 2012; Vilhauer 2012. For further discussion see the entry\n skepticism about moral responsibility).\n\nIt is worth observing that in many of these disputes about the nature\nof free will there is an underlying dispute about the nature of moral\nresponsibility. This is seen clearly in Hobbes (1654 [1999]) and early\ntwentieth century philosophers\u2019 defenses of compatibilism.\nUnderlying the belief that free will is incompatible with determinism\nis the thought that no one would be morally responsible for any\nactions in a deterministic world in the sense that no one would\ndeserve blame or punishment. Hobbes responded to this charge\nin part by endorsing broadly consequentialist justifications of blame\nand punishment: we are justified in blaming or punishing because these\npractices deter future harmful actions and/or contribute to reforming\nthe offender (1654 [1999], 24\u201325; cf. Schlick 1939; Nowell-Smith\n1948; Smart 1961). While many, perhaps even most, compatibilists have\ncome to reject this consequentialist approach to moral responsibility\nin the wake of P. F. Strawson\u2019s 1962 landmark essay\n\u2018Freedom and Resentment\u2019 (though see Vargas (2013) and\nMcGeer (2014) for contemporary defenses of compatibilism that appeal\nto forward-looking considerations) there is still a general lesson to\nbe learned: disputes about free will are often a function of\nunderlying disputes about the nature and value of moral\nresponsibility.\n",
