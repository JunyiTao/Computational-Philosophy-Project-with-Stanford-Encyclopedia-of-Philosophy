    "main_text": "The Concept of Exploitation || Attitudinal Conditions\n2.3 Attitudinal Conditions\n\nAccounts of exploitation that depart from the traditional analysis\nthat relies only on unfairness generally append one of three\nattitudinal conditions. They claim that in addition to, or in place of\nunfairness, exploitation involves either domination, disrespect, or an\nawareness of one\u2019s unfair advantage. In this section we survey\neach of these approaches.\n2.3.1 Disrespect and Domination\n\nAlthough many accounts of exploitation reference disrespect,\nrelatively few characterise disrespect as an independent condition for\nexploitation. For example, Ruth Sample has argued that there are three\nways we might fail to respect the value another person: \u201cby\nneglecting what is necessary for their wellbeing\u2026by taking\nadvantage of an injustice\u2026and by commodifying, or treating as a\nfungible object of market exchange, an aspect of that person\u2019s\nbeing that ought not to be commodified\u201d (2003:57). Later Sample\nacknowledges that, on its own, improper commodification does not lead\nto exploitation. Rather, improper commodification is one\ncharacteristic consequence of a prior vulnerability. Thus, her forms\nof disrespect reduce to taking advantage of past injustice and failing\nto meet basic needs.\n\nWhile these two behaviours are no doubt disrespectful, they are also\nforms of transactional unfairness (discussed in section 2.2). In this\ncase, an appeal to disrespect offers a deeper analysis by explaining\nwhat is wrong with the unfairness involved in exploitation, but it\ndoes not act as an additional necessary or sufficient condition for\nexploitation.\n\nSimilarly, Jonathan Wolff has argued that \u201cto exploit someone is\nto make use of their circumstances in a way which fails properly to\nacknowledge their standing as an end in themself\u201d (1999: 113).\nHe then points out that the different traditions in moral\nphilosophy\u2014Kantian, Aristotelian, and Utilitarian\u2014offer\ndifferent accounts of what it means to treat others as ends in\nthemselves. Yet, on Wolff\u2019s analysis, each of these accounts\nends up returning to fairness. For example, Wolff argues that \u201cA\nKantian interpretation of the baseline for\nexploitation\u2014motivated by taking a Kantian interpretation of\nwhat it is to be an end in itself\u2014leads us to a\n\u2018fairness\u2019 norm. Kantian exploitation \u2026 is to use\nanother person\u2019s vulnerable circumstances to obtain their actual\ncompliance with a situation that violates norms of fairness\u201d\n(1999: 114). Both Wolff\u2019s and Sample\u2019s analyses of the\nrelationship between exploitation, unfairness, and disrespect are\nplausible, but neither characterizes disrespect as an\nadditional condition that limits the scope of exploitation.\nIf we want to avoid the problems for purely distributive accounts that\nElster and Ferguson raise, we require conditions that do more than\ncharacterise exploitation as a distributively unfair transactional\noutcome.\n\nAn account that clearly distinguishes disrespect and unfairness is\nNicholas Vrousalis\u2019s domination-based account of exploitation.\nFor Vrousalis, disrespect involves acting towards another in a way\nthat is not \u201cdialogically endorsable\u201d that is, acting in a\nway that gives one \u201creason to feel shame or guilt for putting or\nallowing a particular form of justification for some putative act on\nthe table of discourse\u201d (2013: 140). Domination is a subset of\ndisrespect that involves \u201c\\(A\\) getting \\(B\\) to take\n[\\(A\\)\u2019s] power over \\(B\\) as a reason for \\(B\\) to perform the\npower-directed act\u201d (2021: 110). And exploitation is a subset of\ndominating acts that \u201cobtains when the power-directed act,\nperformed for the power-given reason, is geared towards \\(A\\)\u2019s\nenrichment\u201d (2021: 110). Thus, exploitations involve domination\nand domination disrespect. But crucially, for Vrousalis, unfairness is\nnot a necessary condition for exploitation because fairness \u201cis\nresponsibility constrained equality\u201d, but \u201cexploitation\ncan arise from any material inequality\u201d (2013: 149,\nemphasis added). For Vrousalis, exploitation is a dividend of\ndomination induced servitude, though not necessarily unfair.\n\nUnlike Sample\u2019s and Wolff\u2019s appeals to disrespect,\nVrousalis\u2019s domination condition is distinct from the unfairness\ncondition. However, it is unclear that Vrousalis\u2019s account can\ndo a better job of capturing intuitions about the scope of\nexploitation because, as Richard Arneson (2016) points out, it is\ndifficult to see how the use of others\u2019 vulnerabilities for\nself-enrichment is wrong if such use is not also unfair. He argues\n\u201cOne can readily identify examples in which people exploit the\nweaknesses of others\u2014use these vulner- abilities to secure\nadvantages for themselves\u2014but in which there is no unfair\ndivision of advantages from the interaction and so nothing that\nqualifies as morally objectionable exploitation\u201d (2016: 10). For\nexample, suppose \\(A\\) is selling sandwiches and \\(B\\) is hungry. In\nsuch a case, \\(B\\) is vulnerable to \\(A\\): \\(A\\) controls a good that\n\\(B\\) desires and which contributes to her wellbeing. \\(A\\) can take\nadvantage of this vulnerability to make a profit by selling \\(B\\) a\nsandwich. If \\(B\\) had her own sandwich with her she would not be\nwilling to pay \\(A\\) for one of his, thus \\(A\\) can make use of\n\\(B\\)\u2019s hunger to get her to pay him for the food. But unless\nthe price \\(A\\) charges is also unfair\u2014perhaps because \\(A\\) is\nthe only seller, perhaps because \\(B\\) lacks a sandwich due to\ninjustice, and so on\u2014it is hard to see how \\(A\\)\u2019s\nsandwich sale is wrong. Contrary to Vrousalis\u2019s claims, it seems\nthat unfairness is a necessary condition for exploitation.\n2.3.2 Awareness\n\nAlthough exploitation requires unfairness, it also seems to involve\nmore than unfairness. As Wolff puts it, \u201csomehow, there just\nseems to be more to exploitation than unequal exchange\u201d (1999:\n107). Benjamin Ferguson has argued that exploitation is best\ncharacterised by a two factor account, such that \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\nin a transaction iff \\(A\\) gains unfairly from \\(B\\) in the\ntransaction and \\(A\\) believes, or ought to have believed,\nthat the gains he receives wrong \\(B\\) (2020: 535). Ferguson argues\nthat this two-factor account solves two problems for existing accounts\nof exploitation. The first, which we have already seen, is the scope\nproblem: if exploitation is merely tantamount to unfair transaction,\nthen it seems that the scope of exploitation is too broad. The second\nproblem is the blame problem. Ferguson argues that the best accounts\nof transactional fairness entail that unfair transactions are\npervasive: the next transaction that you or I engage in is likely\nunfair. However, in most transactions we don\u2019t know which party\nis gaining too much and which party is gaining too little. This\nepistemic consequence of pervasive unfairness means that we have no\nreason to blame either party of the transaction. Yet, blame\ntypically accompanies charges of exploitation. To say that \\(A\\)\nexploits \\(B\\) is to say that \\(A\\) has done something for which he\ncan be blamed.\n\nFerguson points out that in the subset of unfair transactions where\n\\(A\\) gains unfairly from \\(B\\) and \\(A\\) knows he gains\nunfairly from \\(B\\), we can blame \\(A\\) because \\(A\\) satisfies\nepistemic conditions for moral responsibility. And, of course, the\nscope of exploitation is constrained by the addition of this knowledge\nrequirement. However, knowledge may be too restrictive for\ntwo reasons.\n\nFirst, if knowledge requires something like justified true belief,\n\\(A\\) can believe he gains unfairly from \\(B\\) and his belief can be\ntrue, without \\(A\\) knowing he gains unfairly if\n\\(A\\)\u2019s belief isn\u2019t properly formed, that is, if his\nbelief is unjustified. Suppose \\(A\\) thinks his transaction with \\(B\\)\nis unfair because he mistakenly accepts a false account of\ntransactional fairness. Further, suppose that the true account of\ntransactional fairness\u2014whatever it may be\u2014and the false\naccount both entail that \\(A\\)\u2019s transaction with \\(B\\) is\nunfair. If \\(A\\) believes the transaction is unfair on the basis of\nthe false account, he lacks justification for this belief and so does\nnot know that the transaction is unfair. If exploitation\nrequires \\(A\\) to know the transaction is unfair, but \\(A\\) does not\nhave this knowledge he does not exploit. Yet, intuitively, such cases\nstill seem exploitative\u2014indeed, it still seems appropriate to\nblame \\(A\\) for engaging in a transaction he believed was unfair (and\nthat was unfair, albeit for different reasons than those \\(A\\) thought\nmade it unfair).\n\nSecond, in some cases \\(A\\) may fail to form the belief that a\ntransaction is unfair due to bias in his selection of evidence or how\nhe weighs evidence. For example, consider slavery. If any kind of\nrelation is exploitative, surely slavery is. Some slave holders surely\nknew slavery was unfair and yet continued to engage in the practice.\nBut suppose some held false beliefs about a \u2018natural\u2019\nhierarchy of races. In such a case they might fail to believe their\ninteractions were unfair. Yet, their holding these false beliefs\namounts to negligence: they were surely presented with evidence that\ncontradicted them.\n\nChanging the condition from knowledge to belief and making room for\nnegligence addresses these problems, but even this relatively weak\ncondition encounters problems, as Ferguson shows in the following\ncase:\n\n\nSuppose \\(A\\) believes exploitation does not involve unfairness, but\nonly domination tout court. \\(A\\) believes he dominates \\(B\\), he\nbelieves transacting with her will exploit her, but as a domination\ntheorist, he does not believe the transaction will be unfair. Suppose\nthat \\(A\\) nevertheless transacts with \\(B\\) and his belief that it is\na fair transaction is false. (2020: 542\u201343)\n\n\nIt is hard to deny that \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\) in such a scenario, yet\nhe does not believe the transaction is unfair, and so does not satisfy\nthe belief-or-negligence condition. This counterexample can be\naddressed by modifying the proposition that \\(A\\) is required to\nbelieve. We needn\u2019t require \\(A\\) to believe (or be negligent in\nfailing to believe) \u2018that the transaction is unfair\u2019 but\nonly the more general proposition \u2018that the gains he receives\nwrong \\(B\\)\u2019. Thus, Ferguson argues we can appropriately\nrestrict the scope of purely distributive accounts and ascribe blame\nto exploiters if we understand exploitation as: \\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\niff (1) \\(A\\) transacts unfairly with \\(B\\) and (2) \\(A\\) believes the\ngains he receives in the transaction wrong \\(B\\).\n3. The Moral Weight and Force of Exploitation\n\nThe primary task of a theory of exploitation is to set forward the\ntruth conditions for the claim, \u201c\\(A\\) exploits \\(B\\)\u201d.\nBeyond this purely conceptual project, however, there remain two more\nstraightforwardly normative tasks. Adopting terminology from Alan\nWertheimer, we can describe the first of these tasks as providing an\naccount of the moral weight of exploitation, where moral\nweight refers to the intensity of exploitation\u2019s wrongness. The\nsecond task is to provide an account of the moral force of\nexploitation, where moral force is understood to refer to \u201cthe\nvarious moral upshots of reasons for action that exploitation might or\nmight not involve for parties to the transaction or for society\u201d\n(Wertheimer 1996: 28).\n\nWhen exploitation is harmful and nonconsensual, issues of both moral\nweight and force are relatively unproblematic. Whatever the added\nmoral importance of the gain to \\(A\\) from the harm to \\(B\\), it is\ncertainly at least prima facie wrong for \\(A\\) to harm \\(B\\)\nand it seems that the state is at least prima facie justified\nin prohibiting or refusing to enforce such transactions. But\nexploitation that takes place in the context of mutually advantageous\nand consensual transactions presents a more difficult set of problems.\nFirst, regarding the issue of moral weight, it might be thought that\neven if a transaction between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is unfair, there can be\nnothing seriously wrong about an agreement from which both\nparties benefit, particularly if \\(A\\) has no obligation to enter into\nany transaction with \\(B\\). At the very least, it seems difficult to\nshow how a mutually advantageous (but unfair) interaction can be\nmorally worse than no-interaction at all since, ex\nhypothesi, there is no party to the transaction for whom it is\nworse. In the recent literature on exploitation, this thought has been\nformulated more precisely as the \u201cnon-worseness\nclaim\u201d:\n\nNWC: Interaction between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) cannot be worse than\nnon-interaction when \\(A\\) has a right not to interact with \\(B\\) at\nall, and when the interaction is mutually advantageous, consensual,\nand free from negative externalities (Wertheimer 1996, 2011; Zwolinski\n2009; Powell and Zwolinski 2012).\n\nMost exploitation theorists are skeptical that the NWC is correct\n(Wertheimer 1996; Bailey 2010; Arneson 2013; Barnes 2013; Malmqvist\n2016). For if it were, then it would seem to be a mistake to blame\nindividuals who engage in certain forms of mutually beneficial\nexploitation\u2014for example, those who engage in \u201cprice\ngouging\u201d by selling electrical generators to victims of natural\ndisasters at inflated prices. (Zwolinski 2008). After all, we usually\nwould not blame those individuals if they stayed home and did nothing.\nBut, so long as people are willing to pay the high prices (and no\ncoercion or fraud is involved), both parties are better off with the\ntransaction than without it. So how could it be morally worse to\nprovide those customers with some benefit than it is to\nprovide them with no benefit at all?\n\nOf course, the NWC need not lead to a deflationary account of the\nwrongness of exploitation. It could, instead, lead to an\ninflationary account of the wrongness of non-interaction. In\nother words, we can account for the NWC\u2019s claim that mutually\nbeneficial exploitation is not worse than non-interaction\neither by saying that mutually beneficial exploitation is\nless wrong than we thought it was, or by saying that\nnon-interaction is worse than we thought it was: by saying that price\ngougers are less blameworthy than we thought, or by saying that those\nwho stay home and do nothing to help victims of disaster are\nmore blameworthy than we thought.\n\nEven if mutually beneficial exploitation really is a serious moral\nwrong, however, it might not be a kind of wrong that can justify state\nintervention (Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 9). In other words, the question of\nthe moral force of exploitation cannot be settled entirely by\nreference to its moral weight. Suppose \\(A\\) is a price gouger who\nsells bottles of water to disaster victims for $12 each. Even if \\(A\\)\nacts wrongly or fails to act virtuously, it is arguable that \\(A\\)\ndoes not harm anyone or violate anyone\u2019s rights, and only harm\nor rights violations justify state intervention. If the state cannot\nforce \\(A\\) to sell the water to \\(B\\), it might be thought completely\nirrational for the state to prohibit \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) from\nentering into a consensual and mutually advantageous transaction.\n\nMoreover, there is a real danger that preventing mutually beneficial\nbut exploitative transactions will wind up \u201cconsigning the\nvulnerable person to an even worse fate than being exploited\u201d\n(Wood 1995: 156). After all, persons who are exploited are taken\nadvantage of because of some antecedent vulnerability\u2014a lack of\naccess to clean drinking water, in the example above. Preventing\nexploitative transactions by itself does nothing to alleviate\nthis vulnerability. Indeed, by depriving vulnerable parties of one\npossibility for improving their situation by engaging in a\nmutually beneficial transaction, such interference might actually\nexacerbate it.\n\nPerhaps this view is correct. Bracketing arguments based on\nexternalities, it seems perfectly plausible to maintain that the state\nis justified in interfering with transactions only if one party is\nviolating the other\u2019s rights. That said, those who invoke the\nconcept of exploitation frequently maintain that such exploitation\nprovides a reason for state intervention. For example, when it is\nclaimed that commercial surrogacy exploits the birth mothers, the\ncritics typically argue that surrogacy contracts should be\nunenforceable or entirely prohibited. Similar things are said about\nthe sale of bodily organs. Those who make such arguments do frequently\nclaim that the transactions are nonconsensual or harmful, but they\nseem prepared to make such arguments even if the transactions are\nconsensual and mutually advantageous.\n\nOn what grounds might we justify interfering with consensual and\nmutually advantageous exploitative transactions? It might be thought\nthat we could interfere on paternalistic grounds. A paternalistic\nargument could not justify interfering with exploitative transactions\nif the exploitative transaction is advantageous to \\(B\\) and if\ninterference is not likely to result in a transaction that is more\nbeneficial to \\(B\\). For paternalism justifies interfering for\nsomeone\u2019s good, and this interference would not be to the\ntarget\u2019s benefit. But there might be situations in which \\(B\\)\nknows enough to agree only to those exploitative transactions that are\nbeneficial (as compared with no transaction), but does not know that\nless exploitative transactions are available. And so there may be a\n\u201csoft paternalist\u201d justification for interference with\nsome mutually advantageous exploitative transactions.\n\nWe might also justify interfering with exploitative transactions on\nstrategic grounds. Suppose that \\(A\\) enjoys a monopoly position, say,\nas a potential rescuer of \\(B\\). If we prohibit \\(A\\) from charging an\nexorbitant price for his services, then \\(A\\) might offer his services\nfor a reasonable price. This argument would not justify interfering in\na highly competitive market, for, under such conditions, \\(A\\) would\nnot and could not offer his services for a better price. But there may\nbe numerous situations in which such strategic arguments can work\n(Wertheimer 1996).\n\nIt is worth noting, however, that prohibiting exploitative\ntransactions is not the only way in which the state or other moral\nagents might attempt to respond to its wrongful nature. Prohibition is\nan example of what Allen Wood describes as \u201cinterference\u201d.\nBut in addition to interference, Wood suggests that we can think of\nredistribution as a way in which third parties such as the\nstate might attempt to prevent exploitation (Wood 1995: 154). After\nall, exploitation is only possible because \\(B\\) is in a position of\nvulnerability relative to \\(A\\) . One way to prevent exploitation,\nthen, is to address this vulnerability directly\u2014to channel\nresources to \\(B\\) so as to remove the hardship that makes him\nvulnerable to exploitation in the first place. If workers in the\ndeveloping world had an adequate social safety net to fall back on,\nfor instance, they would be less inclined to accept a job with the\nharsh conditions of a sweatshop, and therefore less vulnerable to\nexploitation by their employers.\n4. Applied Issues in Exploitation Theory\n\nQuestions about exploitation arise in a wide variety of different\ncontexts, not just in the domain of political philosophy but in\nvarious areas of applied ethics as well such as business ethics,\nbiomedical ethics, and environmental ethics. In addition to the topics\ndiscussed briefly below, the concept of exploitation has played a\ncentral role in debates over payday lending (Mayer 2003), clinical\nresearch in the developing world (Hawkins and Emanuel 2008), markets\nfor human organs (Hughes 1998; Taylor 2005), guest worker programs\n(Mayer 2005), and price gouging (Zwolinski 2008).\n4.1 Universal Basic Income\n\nSome theorists, such as Philippe van Pairjs, have argued that justice\nrequires that the state institute a universal basic income (UBI). A\nUBI is a cash transfer, funded by taxes, that would be paid to all\ncitizens regardless of need, and regardless of whether they are\nworking, or even willing to work (van Parijs 1995). Against this, some\ncritics have charged that a basic income would facilitate a form of\nexploitation. As Stuart White argues,\n\n\nwhere others bear some cost in order to contribute to a scheme of\ncooperation, then it is unfair for one to willingly enjoy the intended\nbenefits of their cooperative efforts unless one is willing to bear\nthe cost of making a relevantly proportionate contribution to this\nscheme of cooperation in return. (White 1997: 317\u2013318)\n\n\nAs is so often the case in dealing with exploitation claims, assessing\nthis objection requires us to grapple with a complicated mix of\nempirical and normative claims. On the empirical side, for instance,\nwe might ask whether a basic income really would lead to a\nnet increase in reciprocity-violating transfers. Some theorists have\nargued that a basic income would actually increase incentives to work\nrelative to currently existing welfare programs, by lowering the\neffective marginal tax rate faced by low-wage workers (Tobin 1966).\nOthers have emphasized the role of unpaid labor in the economy, such\nas domestic labor, and argued that a basic income would lead to a\nfairer application of the reciprocity principle than welfare systems\nthat condition benefits on doing paid work (Pateman 2004).\nNormatively, the objection challenges us to think about both what the\nideal of reciprocity requires and how it fits within a system of\nbroader distributive justice. Some advocates of basic income have\nargued that a liberal-egalitarian theory of justice is correct and\nrequires an equal distribution of scarce resources such as land rent\nand the rent component of wages (van Parijs 1997: 329). Reciprocity\nmay be an important political value, such theorists argue, but it is\none that is to be applied only after people have been given\nwhat they are due at the basic level of justice.\n4.2 Sweatshop Labor\n\nThe term \u201csweatshop\u201d is usually used to refer places of\nemployment that utilize low-skill workers, often in the developing\nworld, and that are characterized by low wages, long hours, and unsafe\nworking conditions. In many cases, sweatshops produce goods on\ncontract for large, multinational enterprises, who then sell those\ngoods to customers in wealthier societies.\n\nMany critics see sweatshop labor as highly exploitative. A large part\nof the debate over this claim has focused on the issue of wages.\nCritics claim that sweatshops have a moral obligation to pay a living\nwage to their workers. This duty is grounded in the extreme need of\nsweatshop workers, the fact that sweatshops and the multinational\nenterprises with which they contract rely on them to produce the goods\nthat they sell, and the fact that the multinational enterprises are\nprofitable enough that they can afford to increase workers\u2019\nwages without jeopardizing the health of their business (Meyers 2004;\nSnyder 2008). Some critics, however, see sweatshops\u2019 low wages\nas merely one symptom of a broader failure to respect workers as\npersons who are ends in themselves. That failure of respect manifests\nitself in sweatshops violation of legal labor standards, their\nexposure of workers to physically dangerous conditions, and their\nabuse and coercion of workers on the job (Arnold and Bowie 2003:\n227\u2013233).\n\nOnce again, a number of difficult empirical and normative issues come\nout in this debate. The empirical issues include not only questions\nabout what conditions in sweatshops are actually like\u2014how low\nwages actually are relative to other firms in the developing economy,\nfor instance\u2014but what effects various attempts to remedy\nsweatshop conditions would actually have. Would a higher legal minimum\nwage improve workers\u2019 overall well-being, or would it instead\nlead to layoffs and plant relocations (Powell and Zwolinski 2012)? On\nthe normative side, the Non-Worseness Condition seems to pose an\nespecially significant challenge to critics of sweatshop labor. If\nsweatshops, by providing jobs and capital infusion in the developing\nworld, provide some benefit to workers there, how can they be\nacting in a morally worse way than wealthy firms that do not outsource\ntheir production at all, and thus provide no benefit to needy\nworkers abroad (Zwolinski 2007; Preiss 2014)? Another question: even\nif we grant that sweatshops exploit their workers, and that\nexploitation is a significant moral wrong, might it be a wrong that is\nall-things-considered justifiable if sweatshop labor nevertheless\nconfers considerable benefits on current workers, and plays an\nimportant role in economic growth? In other words, how much weight\nshould a valid claim of exploitation have in our overall judgment of\nthe justice of a practice or of a set of institutions that permit that\npractice?\n4.3 Commercial Surrogacy\n\nCommercial surrogacy is a practice in which a woman is paid to become\npregnant as a result of either artificial insemination or the\nimplantation of an already fertilized egg, and to surrender her\nparental rights to the intended parent(s). In the United States, most\nsurrogacy arrangements are purely domestic affairs (with both the\nintended parents and the surrogate being citizens of the United\nStates), but a significant number are international, in which the\nsurrogate mother is often a citizen of a much poorer country.\n\nBoth types of surrogacy arrangement have been subjected to criticism\non a number of distinct grounds. Some have argued that surrogacy\ninvolves an objectionable form of \u201ccommodification\u201d, while\nothers have argued that the practice is harmful to children, or to\nwomen as a class. But many have also argued that the practice exploits\nthe women who serve as surrogates. In the case of international\nsurrogacy, this charge is usually based on the bad circumstances and\nlow pay of the women who serve as surrogates. The lack of alternative\nsources of employment has been said to undermine women\u2019s\nconsent, and the compensation they receive is often extremely low\ncompared to the pay received by American surrogates for the same\nservice\u2014sometimes as low as 10%.\n\nIn the case of domestic surrogacy, critics charge that surrogate\nmothers are young and do not fully understand the physical and\npsychological risks that attend the services they are agreeing to\nprovide. As a result, the arrangement might be harmful on net to them\ndespite the fact that they consent to it. Or, even if it is not\nharmful on net, the payment they receive might be inadequate\ncompensation for the costs they incur, thus rendering surrogacy a case\nof mutually beneficial but unfair and exploitative exchange (Tong\n1990).\n\nQuestions of fair compensation for surrogates raise many of the same\nissues, and give rise to many of the same debates, as are found in the\nliterature on sweatshop labor (Wilkinson 2003). But unlike the sort of\nlabor that takes place in sweatshops, some critics believe that\ncommercial surrogacy arrangements are intrinsically wrong. If\nwomen\u2019s reproductive labor is not the sort of service that\nshould be sold at any price, then commercial surrogacy may\ninvolve a kind of exploitation insofar as it entices women to engage\nin an activity that is harmful to their moral character (Anderson\n1990; Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 4).",
