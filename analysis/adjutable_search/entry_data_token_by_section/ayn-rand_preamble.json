    "main_text": "\n\nAyn Rand (1905\u20131982) was a novelist-philosopher who outlined a\ncomprehensive philosophy, including an epistemology and a theory of\nart, in her novels and essays. Early in her career she also wrote\nshort stories, plays, and screenplays. Rand\u2019s first and most\nautobiographical novel, We the Living (1936), set in the\nSoviet Union, was published only after many rejections, owing to\nwidespread sympathy for the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d among the\nintellectuals of the day. We the Living was quickly followed\nby the dystopian novel, Anthem (1938), written as \u201ca\nkind of rest\u201d from work on her next major novel, The\nFountainhead (1943). The Fountainhead, also published\nafter many rejections because of its individualism, and largely panned\nby critics, soon became a best-seller by word of mouth. The\nFountainhead brought Rand international fame, and Atlas\nShrugged (1957) sealed this fame. By 1958, Rand\u2019s novels,\nincreasingly philosophical, had won her ideas a sufficiently devoted\nfollowing for her to form, in association with psychologist Nathaniel\nBranden (with whom she later broke), an official\n\u201cObjectivist\u201d philosophical movement, complete with\njournals and lecture courses. For all her popularity, however, only a\nfew professional philosophers have taken her work seriously. As a\nresult, most of the serious philosophical work on Rand has appeared in\nnon-academic, non-peer-reviewed journals, or in books, and the\nbibliography reflects this fact. We discuss the main reasons for her\nrejection by most professional philosophers in the first section. Our\ndiscussion of Rand\u2019s philosophical views, especially her\nmoral-political views, draws from both her non-fiction and her\nfiction, since her views cannot be accurately interpreted or evaluated\nwithout doing so.\n",
