It is generally thought to be a necessary, but not\nsufficient, condition for a belief\u2019s being justified that the\nbelief be based on a reason. The basing relation is what distinguishes\ngood reasons which a person possesses that contribute to the personal\njustification of a given belief from good reasons which the person\npossesses but that do not contribute to the personal justification of\nthe belief.\n\nBasing relations may be involved in both inferential and\nnon-inferential justification. For example, one may hold that sensory\nstates count as reasons, and thus require that a sensory belief be\nbased on a reason if it is to be justified by that reason. In\naddition, one might understand at least some self-evident beliefs to\nbe based on the meanings of the various terms of the sentence\nexpressing the proposition believed. For example, one\u2019s belief\nthat all bachelors are unmarried men may be understood to be based on\nthe meanings of \u2018all\u2019, \u2018bachelors\u2019,\n\u2018are\u2019, etc.\n\nThe basing relation is most frequently analyzed in terms of a\nreason\u2019s causing a\n belief.[1]\n In such analyses, the reason and the belief are understood to be\nmental states of a person. The cause may be a contributing cause or a\nsufficient cause. However, the basing relation has also been analyzed\nas an appropriate counterfactual cause of a belief and also as\ndepending on an appropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason is\na good reason to hold the belief.\n\nAnalysis of the basing relation is relevant to a variety of\nfundamental epistemological issues. It is relevant to the nature of\nepistemic rationalization and to questions regarding the\ninternalism/externalism debate. In addition, it has been argued that\nreliabilist theories of justification are incompatible with the\ncorrect analysis of the basing relation.\n", "toc": [{"#CauTheBasRel": "1.

Causal Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nCausal theories of the basing relation hold that for a belief to be\nbased on a reason, the reason must cause the belief in an appropriate\nway. Causal theories of the basing relation must not be confused with\ncausal theories of knowledge or justification. One might take a causal\ntheory of the basing relation to explain how one has taken into\naccount the reasons one possesses when forming or evaluating a belief,\nregardless of whether the reason actually contributes to the\njustification of the belief. Also, one might hold that a\nbelief\u2019s being justified requires not only being based on a good\nreason, but also requires, e.g., the fulfillment of various epistemic\nduties, coherence within an appropriate cognitive system, etc.\n\nPaul Moser offers the following example of a causal theory of the\nbasing relation for propositional reasons (Moser, 1989, p. 157):\n\nS\u2019s believing or assenting to P is based on\nhis justifying propositional reason Q =df\nS\u2019s believing or assenting to P is causally\nsustained in a nondeviant manner by his believing or assenting to\nQ, and by his associating P and Q.\n\n\nMoser limits this account of the basing relation to instances of\ninferential knowledge, unlike the more general characterization of the\nbasing relation given above.\n\nA belief is causally sustained by a reason when the reason maintains\nthe belief, much like a rope might sustain the height and position of\na hanging plant. On Moser\u2019s account, the belief must be causally\nsustained in a nondeviant manner by both the believing of or assenting\nto Q and by the association of P and Q.\n\nMoser defines the appropriate occurrent association relation as\nfollows (Moser 1989, pp. 141\u2013142):\n\nS occurrently satisfies an association relation between\nE and P =df (i) S has a de\nre awareness of E\u2019s supporting P, and\n(ii) as a nondeviant result of this awareness, S is in a\ndispositional state whereby if he were to focus his attention only on\nhis evidence for P (while all else remained the same), he\nwould focus his attention on E.\n\n\nThe association relation may also be non-occurrent and the belief\nstill justified by the reason in question. In this case, condition (i)\nwill have been satisfied in the past and the dispositional state\ndescribed in condition (ii) will still be present. The \u201cde\nre awareness\u201d is a non-propositional, direct awareness of\nE\u2019s supporting P. This is the sort of\nawareness one might have of being thirsty or cold before thinking\n\u201cI\u2019m thirsty\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m cold\u201d. This\nawareness is non-propositional in that you need not put it into words\nin order to have it, and it is direct in the sense that no sensation\nstate (mental image, sense datum) need come between being thirsty and\nbeing aware of one\u2019s thirst. By contrast, some have held that,\nfor example, our awareness that there is a table in the room is\nindirect in that it is mediated by a sensation state (mental image,\nsense-datum) which represents the table.\n\nIn addition to Moser\u2019s theory, there are a variety of other\npossible causal theories of the basing relation which might be\nproposed. For example, one might eliminate the association condition,\nrequiring only that the reason cause the belief in some appropriate\nway. One motivation for such a theory might be the view that one need\nnot be aware of a reason for it to be the basis of a belief, as in the\ncase of subliminal reasons. One issue here would be whether such\nsubconscious states can be justifying reasons. Alternatively, one\nmight hold that the reason need not sustain the belief, but only have\ncaused the belief to come into existence. One motivation for such a\nview might be that one may justifiably believe things on the basis of\nreasons one has forgotten (Goldman 2001, pp. 214\u2013216). For\nexample, most people cannot remember on what basis they came to\nbelieve that tigers are native to Asia, but it seems obvious that such\npeople are still justified in believing this. In such cases, the\nreason no longer sustains the belief\u2014in fact, the reason is no\nlonger possessed. Nonetheless, it might be argued, one\u2019s belief\nthat tigers are native to Asia is still based on the reason which\noriginally caused it. On the other hand, one consideration against\nthis view is the intuition that a belief cannot be justified if one\npossesses no reason for it. In addition, it may be argued that there\nare other ways of accounting for how a belief may be justified even if\nthe original reason for it has been forgotten. For instance, one might\nreason as follows: \u201cI can\u2019t recall where I first learned\nthis, but I feel sure it is true, and such feelings have proved to be\nreliable in the past. Hence, my belief that tigers are native to Asia\nis probably true.\u201d\n\nA variety of objections have been raised against causal theories of\nthe basing relation\n generally.[2]\n The most common of these is the problem of deviant causal chains, a\nproblem which plagues causal analyses in general. With regard to the\nbasing relation, the problem is that not every instance of a\nreason\u2019s causing a belief will establish a basing relation.\nAlvin Plantinga illustrates the problem well (Plantinga 1993, p. 69,\nn.8):\n\nSuddenly seeing Sylvia, I form the belief that I see her; as a result,\nI become rattled and drop my cup of tea, scalding my leg. I then form\nthe belief that my leg hurts; but though the former belief is a (part)\ncause of the latter, it is not the case that I accept the latter on\nthe evidential basis of the\n former.[3]\n\n\nWhat makes the problem so difficult is that there are a variety of\nways the causal chain of events can go wrong and thereby fail to\nestablish a basing relation. For example, glitches in the brain,\nwandering thoughts, wishful thinking, strong emotions, etc., may all\nbe implicated in deviant causal chains. It is quite difficult to\nclearly explain what non-deviant causation amounts to, yet without\nsuch an explanation causal theories are ultimately unsatisfactory.\n\nHowever, there have been efforts to modify causal theories to avoid\nthe problem:\n\nAn interesting possible solution to the problem is provided by Kevin\nMcCain (McCain 2012). McCain proposes an interventionist account of\ncausation according to which (roughly) X causes Y if and\nonly if were a change in X to occur, Y would change in a\nregular way (setting aside any other redundant causes of Y).\nMoreover, X is a direct cause of Y if and only if,\nsetting aside all other causally relevant events, a possible\nintervention on X (e.g., to eliminate its causal power) would\nchange Y (e.g., Y would not occur). The basing relation\nthen gets defined as follows:\n\nA person S\u2019s belief that p at time t is\nbased on her reasons R if and only if at t:\n\n\neach ri \u2208 R is a direct cause of\nS\u2019s believing that p, and\neach ri \u2208 R is an actual cause\nof S\u2019s believing that p, and\nIt is not the case that intervening to set the values of all\ndirect causes of S\u2019s believing that p, other than\nthe members of R, to zero will result in S\u2019s not\nbelieving that p when every ri \u2208\nR is held fixed at its actual value.\n (McCain 2012, p. 364)\n\n\nTo set the value of a direct cause to zero is merely to stipulate that\nit is not a cause. Thus, condition (3) ensures that the members of\nR are collectively sufficient to cause S\u2019s belief that\np.\n\nMcCain\u2019s theory offers a quick solution to the problem of\ndeviant causal chains. In Plantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia, for\ninstance, the person\u2019s belief that their leg hurts is based only\non the pain felt in their leg for, on McCain\u2019s theory, neither\nthe becoming rattled nor the belief that the person sees Sylvia are a\ndirect cause of the belief that their leg hurts. This is because\nneither the belief nor the becoming rattled are direct causes of the\nbelief that their leg hurts. (McCain 2012, p. 372) The requirement\nthat a cause be direct in order to be the basis of a belief seems to\nlimit, in cases like these, causes that establish basing relations to\nthe immediately previous link in the causal chain of events. To\noversimplify the point to a slogan, McCain eliminates the problem of\ndeviant causal chains by eliminating the causal chains (from counting\nas bases).\n\nMcCain discusses the potential problem that it might be implausible to\nrequire that basing relations be direct (McCain 2012, p.\n368\u2013369). To use McCain\u2019s example, suppose that Sally\nbelieves that p and that p \u2283 q\n(\u201cp implies q\u201d), and validly infers, and\nthereby comes to believe, that q. She also believes q\n\u2283 t, and validly infers t from her beliefs that\nq and q \u2283 t. On McCain\u2019s theory of the\nbasing relation, since Sally\u2019s beliefs that p and\np \u2283 q are not direct causes of her belief that\nt, her belief that t is not based on those beliefs. In\nother words, on McCain\u2019s theory, the basing relation is not\ntransitive. This raises questions about whether McCain\u2019s theory\nadequately accounts for our pre-theoretical account of the basing\nrelation. In particular, does McCain\u2019s theory correctly identify\none\u2019s reasons for one\u2019s beliefs? McCain replies that,\ngiven his theory, we can still claim that, e.g., Sally\u2019s belief\nthat t is dependent on her beliefs that p and that\np \u2283 q, even if not based on them.\n\nAn alternative kind of causal theory of the basing relation, also\nintended to avoid the problem of deviant causal chains, is proposed by\nRu Ye (Ye 2020) and named Causation Caused by Believing (CCB):\n\n\n(CCB) One\u2019s belief that p is based on a reason R\njust in case R causes the belief and the causation is caused\nby one\u2019s believing that R supports p.\n\n\nPresumably, R need not produce the belief that p,\nbut may instead causally sustain it. Thus, one could acquire the\nbelief that p, and only later base the belief that p\non R. Note that unlike doxastic theories of the basing\nrelation, discussed below, the belief that R supports\np, alone, is not sufficient to establish a basing\nrelation.\n\nIn general, why would a (potential) reason cause one belief rather\nthan another or none at all? A natural answer is that the person\nbelieves something to the effect that the reason is a good reason to\nhold the belief. (CCB) captures this thought quite nicely.\n\nYe argues that (CCB) has considerable explanatory power. In\nparticular, it is said to avoid the problem deviant causal chains.\nConsider Plantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia: your belief that your leg\nhurts, though caused by seeing Sylvia enter the room, is not based on\nit because you lack the belief that seeing Sylvia supports your belief\nthat your leg hurts. It may also help with clarifying the distinction\nbetween triggering causes and structural causes: the latter play a\ndifferent causal role than the former. In the case of (CCB), the\nstructuring causes include the belief to the effect that R is\na good reason to believe that p.\n\nYe goes on to argue that CCB does not over-intellectualize basing (an\nobjection discussed further below, with doxastic theories of the\nbasing relation), putting it beyond the ability of those \u2013 such as\nyoung children \u2013 with very few epistemic concepts because, following\nMoser, the belief about one\u2019s reasons may be de re.\nRegarding those incapable of forming even such a de re\nbelief, Ye argues that such cases are indistinguishable from deviant\ncausal chains.\n\nA third alternative form of causal theory, the Causal-Manifestation\nAccount (CMA) proposed by John Turri, is also aimed at avoiding\nproblems with deviant causal chains (Turri 2011). Turri describes the\naccount as, roughly, this:\n\n\n(CMA): R is among your reasons for believing Q if\nand only if R\u2019s causing your belief manifests (at least\nsome of ) your cognitive traits.\n\n\nA cognitive trait is taken to be a disposition or habit to form (or\nsustain) a doxastic attitude under certain circumstances. These may\ninclude, for example, taking an experience at face value, or reasoning\nin a pattern corresponding to modus ponens, etc. Consider\nPlantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia: seeing Sylvia causes your belief\nthat you are in pain. But the causal relation as a whole between the\ntwo events does not manifest any cognitive traits, such as some sort\nof cognitive inference. Individual links in the chain of events\nbeginning with seeing Sylvia may manifest some cognitive traits, but\nnot the causal relation as a whole.\n\nA second line of objection to causal theories of the basing relation\nin general involves counterexamples raised in Lehrer\n 1971.[4]\n We\u2019ll henceforth call these \u201csuperstitious lawyer\u201d\nexamples, and they go like this. Suppose a series of eight grisly\nmurders has been committed, all the available evidence indicates that\nthe lawyer\u2019s client committed the first seven of those murders,\nand everyone believes that he committed the eighth murder as well.\nHowever, the lawyer, being superstitious, has absolute faith in the\ncards. The cards indicate that his client is innocent of the eighth\nmurder, and the lawyer comes to believe this on the basis of his faith\nin the cards. The lawyer then re-examines the evidence and finds a\nvery complicated line of reasoning showing that his client is innocent\nof the eighth murder. The lawyer recognizes that the complicated line\nof reasoning shows that his client is innocent. However, due to the\ngrisly nature of the case, the lawyer (and everyone else) strongly\ndesires to believe that the murderer of all eight victims has been\nfound. Thus, the lawyer\u2019s belief that the complicated line of\nreasoning is correct lacks the overwhelming emotional conviction\nneeded to overcome the lawyer\u2019s desire, and thus cannot cause\nthe lawyer to believe that his client is innocent of the eighth\nmurder. It is only his unshakable faith in the cards that is\nsufficient to cause the lawyer to believe that his client is innocent.\nNonetheless, since the lawyer takes the line of reasoning seriously,\nit seems reasonable to believe that the complicated line of reasoning\ncould give the lawyer knowledge that his client is innocent.\n\nThe idea behind Lehrer\u2019s example is to conjoin the intuition\nthat the lawyer is justified in believing that his client is innocent\nwith the view that being justified in holding a belief requires that\nthe belief be based on a good reason in order to arrive at the\nconclusion that the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is innocent\nis based on the complicated line of reasoning.\n\nThe case of the superstitious lawyer is very complicated and\nLehrer\u2019s argument has frequently been criticized. Alvin Goldman,\nfor example, has claimed that \u201c\u2026I find this example\nunconvincing. To the extent that I clearly imagine that the lawyer\nfixes his belief solely as a result of the cards, it seems intuitively\nwrong to say that he knows\u2014or has a justified\nbelief\u2014that his client is innocent.\u201d (Goldman 1979,\np. 22, n.\n 8)[5]\n Goldman does not elaborate on this objection, but the concern is that\nthe lawyer has not taken his good reason into proper account when\nforming his belief that his client is innocent. One way of responding\nto this concern is presented below in the discussion of the\ncausal-doxastic theory of the basing relation.\n2. Counterfactual Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nAmong the most widely discussed theories of the basing relation is\nthat presented by Marshall Swain (1979, 1981, and 1985). Concerned\nabout superstitious-lawyer style counterexamples, Swain suggests that\na counterfactual analysis of causation may avoid them without doing\nviolence to the intuitions underlying causal theories of the basing\nrelation. A counterfactual statement is a statement of the form\n\u201cIf A were to occur, then B would\noccur\u201d, where \u2018A\u2019 and\n\u2018B\u2019 denote events. Roughly, the idea is that a\nbelief is based on a reason if the reason either non-deviantly causes\nor would have caused (in the appropriate circumstances) the belief in\nquestion. Very roughly, where the reason would have caused the belief\n(in the appropriate circumstances), the reason is, in Swain\u2019s\nterminology, a pseudo-overdeterminant of the belief, and hence the\nbelief is based on it. Swain argues that the complicated line of\nreasoning is a pseudo-overdeterminant of the lawyer\u2019s belief\nthat his client is innocent, and hence that there is a kind of causal\nconnection between the complicated line of reasoning and the\nlawyer\u2019s belief by virtue of which the lawyer\u2019s belief is\nbased on the reasoning. Swain more precisely defines\npseudo-overdeterminants as follows (1981, p. 70):\n\n(DPO) Where c and e are occurrent events, c\nis a pseudo-overdeterminant of e if and only if:\n\n\nc is not a cause of e(that is, there is no\ncausal chain from c to e and c is not a\ngenuine overdeterminant of e);\u00a0 and\nthere is some set of occurrent events, D =\n{d1, d2,\u2026,\ndn} (possibly having only one member), such that\n\n\neach di in D is a cause of\ne; and\nif no member of D had occurred, but c and\ne had occurred anyway, then there would have been a causal\nchain from c to e, and c would have been\ncausally prior to e.\n \n\n\n\nHere \u2018c\u2019 stands for a cause and\n\u2018e\u2019 for an effect. If we restrict the application\nof (DPO) to reasons and beliefs, c will be the reason and\ne will be the belief caused by the reason. The\n\u201cdi\u201d will stand for the actual\nreason(s) for the belief. So, (DPO) in effect states that if the\nactual reason(s) di for the belief had not\noccurred, then if another reason c and the belief had\noccurred anyway, and only the minimum necessary changes in the\nperson\u2019s epistemic situation (e.g., the person\u2019s other\nbeliefs, reasons, etc.) are made, then reason c would have\ncaused the belief and is therefore a pseudo-overdeterminant of the\nbelief.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that a potential reason will not\npseudo-overdetermine a belief simply because there is some possible\nworld in which the actual reason does not cause the belief yet the\npotential reason does. This is much too broad, for it would allow\nbeliefs to be based on reasons when it seems obvious that they are not\nso based in the actual world. Rather, the various stipulations in\n(DPO) are intended to limit the relevant domain of possible worlds to\nthose as close as possible to the actual world.\n\nSwain\u2019s theory of the basing relation counts\npseudo-overdeterminants of a belief as reasons upon which a belief is\nbased, as we can see from the definition of the basing relation Swain\noffers (Swain 1981, p. 74 and pp.\n 86\u201387)[6]:\n\n(DB) S\u2019s belief that h is based upon the set\nof causal reasons R at a time t\n=df\n\nS believes that h at t; and\nFor every member rj of R, there is\nsome time tn (which may be identical with or\nearlier than t) such that\n\n\nS has (or had) rj at\ntn; and\nEither\n\n\nS\u2019s having rj at\ntn is a cause (including genuine\noverdetermination) of S\u2019s believing h at\nt or S\u2019s having rj at\ntn is a pseudo-overdeterminant of\nS\u2019s believing that h at t; or\nfor some ri and ti that\nsatisfy condition (i), with \u2018ri\u2019\nsubstituted for \u2018rj\u2019 and\n\u2018ti\u2019 for\n\u2018tn\u2019, S\u2019s having\nrj at tn is either a cause or\na pseudo-overdeterminant of S\u2019s having\nri at ti, or\n\u2026 , etc.\n \n \n\n\n\nGenuine causal overdeterminants occur when two or more causes both\noccur and each is sufficient to generate a particular effect. For\nexample, perhaps a table has five legs, four at the corners and one at\nthe center. It may be the case that the four legs at the corners are\nsufficient to cause the table to remain upright, but if the four legs\nat the corners were removed, the center leg would also be sufficient\nto keep the table upright. Here, the effect of the table\u2019s\nremaining upright is overdetermined by the center leg, on the one\nhand, and the four legs at the corners, on the other. Similarly,\nperhaps a person has two good reasons for holding a belief, and either\none alone would be sufficient to cause the belief. In this case, the\ntwo reasons would be said to overdetermine the belief. Assuming that\nthe causal relations were not deviant, the belief would be based on\nboth of the reasons. The \u2018ri\u2019 and\n\u2018rj\u2019 in (DB) are simply reasons on\nwhich the belief is based. Condition (ii) allows that a reason\nrj, which is in turn a reason for\nri, which in turn is a reason for the belief that\nh, is also a reason on which the belief that h is\nbased, and the \u201cor \u2026, etc.\u201d clause is intended to\ninclude each of the reasons in a long chain of reasoning leading to\nthe belief to count as reasons upon which the belief is based.\n\nOne advantage of Swain\u2019s theory (which could be easily\nincorporated into many other theories of the basing relation) is that\nreasons are not limited to beliefs. Things like perceptual states\n(such as seeing something) or what Swain calls sensation states (such\nas experiencing hunger, thirst, pain, or other things which we sense\nbut not necessarily through the five senses) are counted (by\nstipulation) as non-propositional reasons for the purposes of his\ntheory. Thus, a unified account of belief basing is provided.\n\nAs already noted, Swain\u2019s theory is intended to avoid\nLehrer\u2019s objection regarding superstitious-lawyer style\ncounterexamples. The complicated line of reasoning is not a cause or\ncausal overdeterminant of the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is\ninnocent because the lawyer\u2019s strong desire to believe that his\nclient is guilty of the eighth murder prevents the complicated line of\nreasoning from causing the belief that his client is innocent. The\ndegree of conviction the lawyer has in the complicated line of\nreasoning is sufficient for the lawyer to believe the complicated line\nof reasoning (once his strong desire to believe that his client is\nguilty is overridden by his strong faith (or rational belief, as the\ncase may be) in the cards), but alone is not sufficient to override\nhis strong desire to believe that his client is innocent. Swain argues\nthat (DB) avoids Lehrer\u2019s objection because the complicated line\nof reasoning pseudo-overdetermines the lawyer\u2019s belief that his\nclient is innocent (Swain 1981, p. 74 and pp. 86\u201387). We can see\nhow this is to work by examining condition (2)(b) of (DPO). Suppose\nthat the actual cause of his belief that his client is innocent\n(di) (namely, the lawyer\u2019s belief about the\nresult of the card reading) had not occurred, and that both the\ncomplicated line of reasoning (c) and the belief that his\nclient is innocent (e) had occurred anyway. On this\nsupposition, the lawyer\u2019s strong desire to believe that his\nclient is guilty of all eight crimes could not have occurred, because\nif it had it would have prevented the lawyer from believing that his\nclient is innocent. Since the lawyer\u2019s strong desire is the only\nthing that prevents the complicated line of reasoning from causing the\nlawyer\u2019s belief that his client is innocent, the complicated\nline of reasoning would then have caused the lawyer to believe that\nhis client is innocent. Thus, the complicated line of reasoning\npseudo-overdetermines the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is\ninnocent, and hence, on (DB), the lawyer\u2019s belief is based on\nthe complicated line of reasoning in Lehrer\u2019s original example.\nSo on Swain\u2019s theory, the lawyer\u2019s belief is based on the\ncomplicated line of reasoning, in accordance with Lehrer\u2019s\nintuitions about the case. Contrary to Lehrer, however, Swain argues\nthat there is a counterfactual causal connection between the reasoning\nand the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is innocent, thus\nproviding a theory of the basing relation consistent with the\nintuition that the basing relation is best analyzed in terms of a\nreason\u2019s causing a belief.\n\nA variety of objections to Swain\u2019s theory have been proposed in\nthe\n literature.[7]\n Perhaps the best of these is that presented by Joseph Tolliver (1982,\npp. 151\u2013155). Tolliver\u2019s counterexample, which he calls\nthe pendulum case, goes like this: suppose a physics student has\nlearned that from the period of a pendulum (i.e., the time it takes to\ncomplete a swing) one can calculate its length and vice versa.\u00a0\nThe student measures a particular pendulum and discovers that it has a\nlength L, and calculates that it must have period P.\nThe student also has two general beliefs about pendulums, namely (1)\nthat if x is a pendulum of period P, then x\nis a pendulum of length L, and (2) that if x is a\npendulum of length L, then x is a pendulum of period\nP. We may suppose that it is clear in this case that the\nstudent\u2019s belief about the period is based (at least in part) on\nher belief about its length, but her belief about its length is not\nbased on her belief about the period. But, Tolliver claims, the\nstudent\u2019s belief about the period pseudo-overdetermines her\nbelief about the length of the pendulum, and hence gets counted, on\nSwain\u2019s theory, as the basis of her belief about the length of\nthe pendulum. This is so because, according to Tolliver, if the actual\ncause of the student\u2019s belief about the length had not occurred,\nand if the student still had both her belief about the period and her\nbelief about the length, then her belief about the period would have\ncaused her belief about the length.\n\nOne natural line of reply to this sort of counterexample to\nSwain\u2019s theory would be to further specify the sorts of changes\nin one\u2019s epistemic situation that are consistent with\npseudo-overdetermination. For example, perhaps the student in the\nabove example would have to engage in further reasoning, inferring the\nlength of the pendulum from her two general beliefs about pendulums\nand her belief about the period of the pendulum. If such additional\ninferences could be ruled out as being unwarranted changes in the\nstudent\u2019s epistemic situation, then the student\u2019s belief\nabout the period would not pseudo-overdetermine her belief about the\nlength of the pendulum.\n3. Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nDoxastic theories of the basing relation hold that having an\nappropriate meta-belief to the effect that a reason is a good reason\nto hold a belief is sufficient for the belief\u2019s being based on\nthe reason. Such a theory appears to be a natural fit for certain\nkinds of epistemic internalism. For such an account, see Leite (2008).\nSome theories of the basing relation, such as those of Helen Longino\nand Robert Audi, state that such a meta-belief is a necessary but not\nsufficient condition for a belief\u2019s being based on a reason\n(Longino 1978; Audi 1986). Such theories hold that if a belief is to\nbe based on a reason, the reason must non-deviantly cause the belief,\nand an appropriate meta-belief must be present. Such theories tend to\nbe vulnerable to the objections to causal theories of the basing\nrelation as well as the objections\u2014to be discussed\nshortly\u2014to doxastic theories of the basing relation.\n\nHere, we will examine Joseph Tolliver\u2019s account of the basing\nrelation. Roughly, Tolliver\u2019s view is that a belief is based on\na reason for a person S if and only if S believes\nthat the reason provides evidence for the belief, and also believes\nthat it is likely that the probability that the belief is true\nincreased at the time the reason was accepted. Tolliver\u2019s aim is\nto avoid the pendulum objection to Swain\u2019s theory while\naffirming Swain and Lehrer\u2019s intuition in the case of the\nsuperstitious lawyer that the lawyer\u2019s belief that his client is\ninnocent is based on the complicated line of reasoning.\nTolliver\u2019s account is as follows (Tolliver 1982, p.\n 159):[8]\n\n(B) S bases his or her belief that b on reason\nr at a time t if and only if\n\n\n\n(1) S believes that b at t and S\nbelieves that r at t, and\n\n(2) S believes that the truth of r is evidence for\nthe truth of b at t, and\n\n(3) Where S\u2019s estimate of the likelihood of b\nequals h at t (h being greater than 0 and\nless than or equal to 1), if it were the case that S came to\nbelieve r for the first time at t, then\nS\u2019s estimate of the likelihood of the proposition\n\u201cthe likelihood of b is greater than or equal to\nh\u201d would be greater at t then it was prior to\nt.\n\n\n\nCondition (3) is intended to handle the pendulum case discussed above.\nIn the pendulum case, the student measures the length of a pendulum\nand thereby comes to believe that it has length L. On the\nbasis of this measurement and other truths she knows about pendulums,\nthe student is able to calculate the period of the pendulum. Thus, the\nstudent\u2019s belief about the length serves as a reason for her\nbelief about the period. The apparent problem for Swain\u2019s view\nwas that the students belief about the period also seemed to be\ncounted as a reason on which her belief about the length was based,\nwhen in fact the basing relation went in the reverse direction.\nTolliver\u2019s theory attempts to handle this problem by means of\ncondition (3), which is intended to specify the direction of the\nevidential support relation. Once the student measures the length and\nmakes the inference about the period, the student\u2019s estimate of\nthe likelihood that the pendulum has period P would increase.\nHowever, the student\u2019s belief about the period of the pendulum\nwould not, according to Tolliver, increase the estimate of the\nlikelihood that the pendulum has length L because the\nstudent\u2019s belief about the length is needed to calculate the\nperiod.\n\nOne common line of objection to doxastic theories of the basing\nrelation has to do with individuals who do not possess the epistemic\nconcepts needed to form the meta-belief (that a reason is a good\nreason to hold a belief) required by doxastic theories, but who\nnonetheless seem to base beliefs on reasons. For example, young or\nuneducated persons may seem perfectly capable having reasons for\nbeliefs even if they lack the appropriate concepts of epistemic\nevidence required by condition (2) of Tolliver\u2019s theory. One\npossible line of reply to this sort of objection would be to stipulate\nthat one may have either an appropriate meta-belief or some\nappropriate form of awareness that need not involve any particular\nfully developed epistemic concept. For example, one might allow, as\ndoes Moser\u2019s theory discussed in the foregoing, that one merely\nhave a de re awareness of the evidential relation holding\nbetween the reason and the belief.\n\nAnother common line of objection to doxastic theories concerns the\npossibility of meta-beliefs (to the effect that a reason is a good\nreason to hold a belief) which do not establish basing relations. For\nexample, suppose Ezekiel belongs to a religious cult and slavishly\nbelieves whatever the cult leader, Exidor, tells him. One day Exidor\ntells Ezekiel that his belief in God is a good reason to believe\neverything else Ezekiel believes, and Ezekiel slavishly comes to\nbelieve this. Nonetheless, it would seem highly counter-intuitive to\naccept that, now, everything else Ezekiel believes is in fact based on\nhis belief in God. Perhaps one way to avoid this sort of objection is\nto add additional conditions as to which meta-beliefs are capable of\nestablishing basing relations. One such solution is discussed below,\nin the section regarding causal-doxastic theories of the basing\nrelation.\n\nA third common line of objection to doxastic theories is that we may\nsometimes base beliefs on reasons of which we are unaware. For\nexample, perhaps beliefs can be based on subconscious reasons. If\nso,then beliefs may be based on reasons even though an appropriate\nmeta-belief (that the reason is a good reason to hold the belief)\ncannot be formed because the person remains unaware of the reason.\n4. Causal-Doxastic Theories of the Basing Relation\n\nThe basic idea of causal-doxastic theories is that a belief may be\nbased on a reason if either an appropriate meta-belief is present (as\nin doxastic theories of the basing relation) or the reason causes the\nbelief in an appropriate way (as in causal theories of the basing\nrelation). One motive for such a view is to avoid superstitious-lawyer\nstyle counterexamples while preserving the intuition that a\nreason\u2019s causing a belief can sometimes establish a basing\nrelation. A second, more fundamental motive begins with the\nobservation that a belief is based on a reason when one has, with\nregard to the belief, taken proper account of the evidential import of\nthe reason. It would be odd if, e.g., the conscious evaluation and\nacceptance of the evidential import of a potential reason for a belief\nwas, in principle, completely irrelevant to whether the belief was\nbased on the reason. Intuitively, it seems that taking proper account\nof a reason may merely involve thinking about the evidential import of\nthe reason in the appropriate way, and whether, in addition, the\nreason non-deviantly causes (or, causally sustains) the belief is\nmerely a contingent, empirical matter.\n\nKeith Allen Korcz\u2019s version of a causal-doxastic theory,\nsomewhat simplified, is as follows (Korcz 2000):\n\n(CD) A person S\u2019s belief that p is based on a\nreason r possessed by S at time t if and\nonly if\n\n\nS believes that p at t, and\nEither\n\n\nthe following two conditions are met:\n\n\nr is an (or contributes to the) internal cause, internal\ncausal overdeterminant or internal causal sustainer, at or prior to\nt, of S\u2019s belief that p, and\nr is not rejected at t,\n\n\nor \nthe following four conditions are met:\n\n\nS at t has a meta-belief or de re\nawareness to the effect that r is a good reason to believe\np, and\nthe causal explanation of S\u2019s having this\nmeta-belief or state of awareness involves both S\u2019s\nbelief that p and r, and\nr, the belief that p, and any other reason the\nmeta-belief or state of awareness is causally based on meets all the\nrequirements of condition (2)(a), and\nS has no other meta-belief or state of awareness contrary\nto the meta-belief described in condition (b)(i).\n \n \n\n\n\nNote that (CD) makes no allowance for a belief\u2019s being based on\na reason when the reason is no longer possessed. There are no such\nbasing relations, given (CD).\n\nAn internal cause is a causal chain of events such that each link in\nthe chain is either a belief, a reason (construed to include\nperceptual and sensation states, as well as beliefs), or an inference.\nOne\u2019s beliefs, reasons, and inferences collectively constitute\nwhat Korcz calls one\u2019s cognitive structure. The various sorts of\ncauses mentioned in (a)(i) are required to be internal to\nS\u2019s cognitive structure so as to avoid problems with\ndeviant causal chains. Deviant causal chains seem to occur when the\nchain of causal events from a putative reason to a belief veers\noutside the persons cognitive structure. For instance, in\nPlantinga\u2019s example of Sylvia discussed above, the causal chain\nof events includes the event of dropping a cup of tea, and this event\nis not one which occurs within the person\u2019s cognitive structure.\nHowever, Korcz acknowledges that this is not a fully satisfactory\nsolution to the problem of deviant causal chains, given the\ndifficulties of specifying exactly which events are internal to\none\u2019s cognitive system in the appropriate way.\n\nCondition (a)(ii) (and, in effect, condition (b)(iv)) requires that\nthe reason a belief is based on not be rejected. A reason for a belief\nis rejected when the following two conditions are met:\n\nS has a meta-belief to the effect that the reason is no\nlonger a good reason to hold the belief, and\none has no meta-beliefs which contradict the meta-belief described\nin (I).\n\n\nBy virtue of condition (I), this account of rejecting a reason for a\nbelief allows for a belief to cease to be based on a reason even when\nthe reason is still retained (not, e.g., forgotten). For example,\nsuppose I believe that Pablo Neruda was a great poet because all great\npoets are revolutionaries and Neruda was a revolutionary. Later, I\ncome to believe that this inference is invalid, yet also come to\nbelieve that all Nobel Prize winners in literature are great poets and\nthat Neruda won the Nobel prize in literature. Thus, I never lose my\nbelief that Neruda is a great poet and I never lose (at least some of)\nmy original reasons for believing that Neruda was a great poet (I\nstill believe that all great poets are revolutionaries and that Neruda\nwas a revolutionary). Instead, the reasons for which I believe that\nNeruda was a great poet have shifted, in part by virtue of the fact\nthat I have come to believe that my original reasons did not support\nmy belief.\n\nCondition (II) of this account of rejecting reasons excludes\ncontradictory meta-beliefs in order to account for some cases in which\nit is unclear whether the reasons for a belief have been rejected.\nWere a person to have contradictory meta-beliefs (perhaps not\nrecognizing they are contradictory as the result of thinking in\ndifferent terms which in fact have the same referent), it would be\nunclear whether the reasons were still the basis of the belief.\n\nCondition (b)(i) of (CD), by allowing that the meta-belief (or state\nof awareness) merely be to the effect that the reason is a good reason\nto hold the belief, is intended to allow the meta-belief to contain\nany appropriate epistemic concept the individual may possess.\nConditions (b)(ii) and (b)(iii) are intended to exclude cases of\nmeta-beliefs which do not establish basing relations, as in the\nexample of Ezekiel discussed above. Ezekiel has the meta-belief that\nhis belief in God is a good reason to believe everything else he\nbelieves. According to (CD), the reason this meta-belief does not\nestablish a basing relation is that it is not non-deviantly caused by\nboth his belief in God and every other belief he has. Instead, it is\nbased on his cult leader, Exidor, telling him that his belief in God\nis a good reason to believe everything else he believes. For the\nmeta-belief to establish a basing relation, it must be based on (i.e.,\nnon-deviantly caused by) the belief and reason(s) it is about. This\nhelps to ensure that the person has taken appropriate account of the\nevidential import of the reason for the belief, much as it does in\ncausal theories of the basing relation.\n\nOne line of objection to Korcz\u2019s causal-doxastic theory is that\nsimply combining causal and doxastic theories is ad hoc,\ni.e., lacks appropriate theoretical support. In turn, this would\nappear to prevent the theory from helping us to understand the basing\nrelation. The basing relation is presumably a unified epistemic\nconcept calling for a unified analysis, not a haphazard conglomeration\nof different conditions, as a disjunctive analysis of the basing\nrelation as either causes or meta-beliefs would suggest. While the\nanalysis may be unified in the sense that it is a causal analysis\nthrough and through, one would not expect the kinds of causes to be so\ndifferent. This objection gains further support if it is mistakenly\nthought that the primary motive for the theory is merely to avoid\nsuperstitious-lawyer style counter-examples.\n\nOne possible line of response to this sort of objection is to note\nthat an important motive for the theory is a fundamental fact about\nhuman thinking, and not merely the desire to avoid\nsuperstitious-lawyer style counter-examples. Intuitively, a\nbelief\u2019s being based on a reason involves taking into account\nthe epistemic import of the reason, and such a mental operation may be\nof two sorts: either directly causal (where a reason non-deviantly\ncauses a belief) or intentional (where one has a meta-belief to the\neffect that a reason is a good reason to hold a belief). The ability\nto reflect on our beliefs and thereby evaluate them is often thought\nto be an ability which distinguishes human cognition from that of many\nother non-human animals. And to properly evaluate a belief is simply\nto take into proper account its evidential import. Thus, it would be\nhighly implausible if such reflective evaluations were absent from an\naccount of a belief\u2019s being based on a reason. Yet on causal\ntheories of the basing relation, such reflective evaluations are\nsuperfluous. On the other hand, such reflective evaluations do not\nappear necessary for a belief to be based on a reason, as previously\nargued. There seem to be situations in which non-deviant causes are\nsufficient to establish basing relations, again as previously argued.\nTherefore, the disjunctive analysis of (CD) appears to be essential if\nwe are to do justice to the various ways the human mind may take into\naccount the evidential import of reasons.\n5. The Basing Relation and Epistemology\n\nGiven that a necessary condition of a belief\u2019s being justified\nis that it be based on an appropriate reason, which theory of the\nbasing relation one adopts may have significant implications for\none\u2019s theory of epistemic justification. For example, accepting\na doxastic or a causal-doxastic theory of the basing relation would\nappear to be at odds with the fundamental intuition behind causal\ntheories of justification (e.g., reliabilism), which assert that a\nbelief is justified merely by being caused in an appropriate way. On a\ndoxastic or causal-doxastic theory, a belief may be based on a good\nreason (and thus, we may suppose, be justified) even if the belief\nwere not caused in the appropriate way or even if the belief were,\nsomehow, not caused at all.\n\nAccepting some doxastic theories of the basing relation will commit\none to a strong form of access internalism. Strong access internalism\nis the view that one must be aware of one\u2019s reasons for a belief\nin order for the belief to be justified in light of those reasons.\nPlausible doxastic theories of the basing relation will likely have\nbuilt in this requirement of access to one\u2019s reasons by virtue\nof requiring that, for a belief to be based on a reason, one must\nbelieve or be aware that the reason is a good reason to hold the\nbelief. Plausible doxastic theories will likely stipulate that one\ncannot have an appropriate meta-belief or state of awareness without\nbeing directly aware of the reason in question, in order to avoid\ncounting meta-beliefs such as that of Ezekiel\u2019s, in the example\ndiscussed above, as sufficient to establish basing relations.\n\nFinally, novel arguments for various forms of skepticism about\njustification can be developed that focus on improperly based beliefs,\nthough such arguments remain largely unexplored. One exception is in\nJonathan Schaffer\u2019s discussion of the debasing demon (Schaffer\n2010). Unlike the Cartesian Demon, the debasing demon may leave\none\u2019s beliefs true and reasons adequate, yet \u201ccross the\nwires\u201d so that beliefs are only based on reasons that fail to\njustify them. Such demonic efforts may include mistaken beliefs about\nwhat belief is based on what reason. Schaffer argues that the debasing\ndemon even leaves us without the foundation of Descartes\u2019\ncogito, since one might be misled as to what reason\none\u2019s belief in one\u2019s own existence is based.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Alston, W., 1986. \u201cInternalism and Externalism in\nEpistemology\u201d, in Alston 1989: 185\u2013226.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1988. \u201cAn Internalistic\nExternalism\u201d, in Alston 1989: 227\u2013245.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1989. <em>Epistemic Justification: Essays\nIn The Theory Of Knowledge</em>, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University\nPress.", "Audi, R., 1983. \u201cThe Causal Structure of Indirect\nJustification\u201d, in Audi 1993: 214\u2013232.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1986. \u201cBelief, Reason And\nInference\u201d, in Audi 1993: 233\u2013273.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1993. <em>The Structure Of\nJustification</em>, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.", "Ballantyne, N. and Evans, I., 2013. \u201cSchaffer\u2019s\nDemon\u201d, <em>Pacific Philosophical Quarterly</em>, 94:\n552\u2013559.", "Bender, J.
