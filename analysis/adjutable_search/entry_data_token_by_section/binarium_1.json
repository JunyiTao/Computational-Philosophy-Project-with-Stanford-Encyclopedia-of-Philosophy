    "main_text": "The \u201cmost famous pair\u201d || Universal hylomorphism\n1.1 Universal hylomorphism\n\n\nPaul Woodruff has defined hylomorphism as \u201cthe doctrine, first\ntaught by Aristotle, that concrete substance consists of forms in\nmatter (hyle)\u201d (Audi [1999], p. 408). One might therefore\nexpect universal hylomorphism to be the doctrine that\nall substances consist of forms in matter. But in fact the\nmedieval theory of universal hylomorphism maintained something slightly\nweaker than that; it held that all substances except God were\ncomposed of matter and form, whereas God is entirely immaterial.\n\n\nThis view seems to be the result of two more basic theses:\n\nthe explicit claim that only God is metaphysically simple in all\nrespects, so that all creatures are metaphysically composite;\nthe view, not always explicitly spelled\nout, that all composition is in some way a composition of matter and\nform, an indeterminate factor and a determining element.\n\n\n\nThe reasoning behind the second thesis is murky. On the other hand,\nit is easy to find medieval authors who argue in detail for the\nfirst\n claim.[3]\n Still, it is surprisingly hard to find any medieval author who gives\na good motivation for it. That is, why should it be\nimportant to maintain that God and only God is metaphysically\nsimple? What rests on the claim?\n\n\nIt it tempting, and plausible, to suppose that the implicit\nreasoning goes something like this: \u201cComposite\u201d (com +\npositus = \u201cput together\u201d) things don't just happen to\nbe composite; something put them together. In short, composition\nrequires an efficient cause. It follows therefore that God, as first\ncause, cannot be composite. Conversely, anything that is caused is in\nsome sense composite. Hence, since everything besides God is created\nand therefore caused, everything other than God is composite. In short,\nthe unique simplicity of God is important to maintain because it is\nrequired by the doctrine of creation. Nevertheless, while this line of\nreasoning is plausible, it is not found clearly stated in any medieval\nauthor I know\n of.[4]\n\n\nThe notion that all creatures are composites of matter and form\nrequires that something be said about what we might otherwise call\n\u201cimmaterial\u201d substances\u2014angels, Aristotelian \u201cseparated\nsubstances,\u201d the human soul after death. For universal hylomorphism,\nsuch entities cannot be truly immaterial, and yet they are obviously\nquite unlike familiar physical objects. As a result, universal\nhylomorphists distinguished between \u201ccorporeal\u201d matter, i.e., the\nmatter of physical, sensible objects, and another kind of matter\nsometimes called\n \u201cspiritual matter.\u201d[5]\n",
