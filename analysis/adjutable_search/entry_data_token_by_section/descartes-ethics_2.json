    "main_text": "The Meditations and the Ethics of Belief\n3. The Meditations and the Ethics of Belief\n\nThe Meditations is distinguished from Descartes\u2019 other\nworks in explicitly foreswearing practical concerns. The conceit of\nthe Meditations is a thinker who has abstracted himself from\nany connection to the external world. For this reason, Descartes feels\nconfident in pursuing the method of hyperbolic doubt, which rejects as\nfalse any opinion concerning which the slightest doubt can be raised:\n\u201cI know that no danger or error will result from my plan, and\nthat I cannot possibly go too far in my distrustful attitude. This is\nbecause the task now in hand does not involve action but merely the\nacquisition of knowledge\u201d (AT VII 22/CSM II 15).\n\nOn these grounds, one might feel justified in setting aside the\nMeditations in an examination of Descartes\u2019 ethics. In\nfact, though, the Meditations pursues, in a theoretical\ncontext, an inquiry that is closely related to ethics: the proper\ndisposition of the will. (For readings of the Meditations as\nsupporting the development of virtue, see Naaman-Zauderer 2010;\nShapiro 2005, 2013.)\n\nDescartes takes the operation of the will to be integral to both\nbelief and action. In general, the will, or \u201cfreedom of\nchoice,\u201d consists \u201cin our ability to do or not do\nsomething (that is, to affirm or deny, to pursue or avoid); or rather,\nit consists simply in the fact that when the intellect puts something\nforward for affirmation or denial or for pursuit or avoidance, our\ninclinations are such that we do not feel we are determined by any\nexternal force\u201d (AT VII 57/CSM II 40). For Descartes, freedom is\nan essential property of the will; however, this freedom does not\nentail indifference: \u201cif I always saw clearly what was true and\ngood, I should never have to deliberate about the right judgement or\nchoice; in that case, although I should be wholly free, it would be\nimpossible for me ever to be in a state of indifference\u201d (AT VII\n58/CSM II 40). We are indifferent only when our perception of the\ntrue, or of the good, is less than clear and distinct.\n\nDescartes assigns the will a pivotal role in the pursuit of knowledge.\nWhen presented with a clear and distinct perception of what is true,\nthe will is compelled to assent to it. When the perception is less\nthan fully clear and distinct, the will is not compelled in the same\nway. In such cases, it has the power either to assent or to withhold\nassent. Given this, the correct use of free will is identified as the\ncritical factor in the attainment of knowledge: \u201cIf\u2026 I\nsimply refrain from making a judgment in cases where I do not perceive\nthe truth with sufficient clarity and distinctness, then it is clear\nthat I am behaving correctly and avoiding error. But if in such cases,\nI either affirm or deny, then I not using my free will\ncorrectly\u201d (AT VII 59\u201360/CSM II 41). Provided we refrain\nfrom assenting to what is not clearly and distinctly perceived, our\njudgments are guaranteed to be true.\n\nIn the Fourth Meditation, Descartes draws a close parallel between the\nwill\u2019s relation to the true and to the good. Just as the will is\ncompelled to assent to what is clearly and distinctly perceived to be\ntrue, so it is compelled to choose what is clearly and distinctly\nperceived to be good: \u201cif I always saw clearly what was true and\ngood, I should never have to deliberate about the right judgement or\nchoice\u201d (AT VII 58/CSM II 40). And analogously, we might\nsuppose, just as the recipe for avoiding error is to withhold assent\nfrom that whose truth is not perceived clearly and distinctly, so the\nrecipe for avoiding moral error, or sin, is to refuse to choose that\nwhose goodness is not perceived clearly and distinctly. In his\nobjections to the Meditations, Arnauld cautioned Descartes on\nthis point, suggesting that the comments he makes \u201con the cause\nof error would give rise to the most serious objections if they were\nstretched out of context to cover the pursuit of good and evil\u201d\n(AT VII 215/CSM II 151). Heeding Arnauld\u2019s warning, Descartes\nadded a disclaimer to the Synopsis of the Meditations:\n\u201cBut here it should be noted in passing that I do not deal at\nall with sin, i.e. the error which is committed in pursuing good and\nevil, but only with the error that occurs in distinguishing truth and\nfalsehood\u201d (AT VII 15/CSM II 11). This assertion flatly\ncontradicts the text of the Fourth Meditation, where Descartes had\nwritten that, where the will is indifferent, \u201cit easily turns\naside from what is true and good, and this is the source of my error\nand sin\u201d (AT VII 58/CSM II 40\u20131). In light of this, and\nDescartes\u2019 insistence to Mersenne that the disclaimer be placed\nin parentheses to indicate that it had been added, there is reason to\nsee Descartes as upholding the same account of the will in relation to\nthe true and the good.\n\nThere is nonetheless one important way in which the operation of the\nwill in a purely theoretical context (such as the\nMeditations) must be distinguished from its operation in\npractical contexts. In the pursuit of certainty, Descartes claims that\nit is both possible and reasonable to withhold assent from any idea\nthat is not perceived clearly and distinctly. Outside the isolated\nconfines of the Meditations, however, it is impossible to\nmaintain such an attitude of detachment. Life demands that we act, by\nchoosing among competing goods on the basis of ideas that are often\nless than clear and distinct. When faced with the exigencies of\nexistence, suspension of choice is not an option. Since we are forced\nto act under conditions of uncertainty, it might seem to follow that\nwe are condemned to a life of moral error, constantly making wrong\nchoices on the basis of inadequate perceptions of the goodness and\nbadness of objects. This may be the ordinary lot of human beings;\nhowever, Descartes does not believe that this condition is\nirremediable. In his later writings he presents an account of virtue\nthat shows how we can improve our ability to make right choices, or to\nact virtuously, despite the inadequacy of much of our knowledge.\n",
