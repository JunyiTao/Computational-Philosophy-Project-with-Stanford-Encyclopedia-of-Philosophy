    "main_text": "Symmetry Arguments\n3. Symmetry Arguments\n\nConsider the following cases.\n\nBuridan\u2019s ass: situated between what are, for him, two\ncompletely equivalent bundles of hay, he has no reason to choose the\none located to his left over the one located to his right, and so he\nis not able to choose and dies of starvation.\nArchimedes\u2019s equilibrium law for the balance: if equal\nweights are hung at equal distances along the arms of a balance, then\nit will remain in equilibrium since there is no reason for it to\nrotate one way or the other about the balance point.\nAnaximander\u2019s argument for the immobility of the Earth as\nreported by Aristotle: the Earth remains at rest since, being at the\ncentre of the spherical cosmos (and in the same relation to the\nboundary of the cosmos in every direction), there is no reason why it\nshould move in one direction rather than another.\n\n\nWhat do they have in common?\n\nFirst, these can all be understood as examples of the application of\nthe Leibnizean Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR): if there is no\nsufficient reason for one thing to happen instead of another, the\nprinciple says that nothing happens (the initial situation does not\nchange). But there is something more that the above cases have in\ncommon: in each of them PSR is applied on the grounds that the initial\nsituation has a given symmetry: in the first two cases, bilateral\nsymmetry; in the third, rotational symmetry. The symmetry of the\ninitial situation implies the complete equivalence between the\nexisting alternatives (the left bundle of hay with respect to the\nright one, and so on). If the alternatives are completely equivalent,\nthen there is no sufficient reason for choosing between them and the\ninitial situation remains unchanged.\n\nArguments of the above kind \u2014 that is, arguments leading to\ndefinite conclusions on the basis of an initial symmetry of the\nsituation plus PSR \u2014 have been used in science since antiquity\n(as Anaximander\u2019s argument testifies). The form they most\nfrequently take is the following: a situation with a certain symmetry\nevolves in such a way that, in the absence of an asymmetric cause, the\ninitial symmetry is preserved. In other words, a breaking of the\ninitial symmetry cannot happen without a reason, or an asymmetry\ncannot originate spontaneously. Van Fraassen (1989) devotes a\nchapter to considering the way these kinds of symmetry arguments can\nbe used in general problem-solving.\n\nHistorically, the first explicit formulation of this kind of argument\nin terms of symmetry is due to the physicist Pierre Curie towards the\nend of nineteenth century. Curie was led to reflect on the question of\nthe relationship between physical properties and symmetry\nproperties of a physical system by his studies on the thermal,\nelectric and magnetic properties of crystals, these properties being\ndirectly related to the structure, and hence the symmetry, of the\ncrystals studied. More precisely, the question he addressed was the\nfollowing: in a given physical medium (for example, a crystalline\nmedium) having specified symmetry properties, which physical phenomena\n(for example, which electric and magnetic phenomena) are allowed to\nhappen? His conclusions, systematically presented in his 1894 work\n\u201cSur la sym\u00e9trie dans les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes\nphysiques\u201d, can be synthesized as follows:\n\nA phenomenon can exist in a medium possessing its characteristic\nsymmetry or that of one of its subgroups. What is needed for its\noccurrence (i.e. for something rather than nothing to happen) is not\nthe presence, but rather the absence, of certain symmetries:\n\u201cAsymmetry is what creates a phenomenon\u201d.\nThe symmetry elements of the causes must be found in their\neffects, but the converse is not true; that is, the effects can be\nmore symmetric than the causes.\n\n\nConclusion (a) clearly indicates that Curie recognized the important\nfunction played by the concept of symmetry breaking in\nphysics (he was indeed one of the first to recognize it). Conclusion\n(b) is what is usually called \u201cCurie\u2019s principle\u201d in\nthe literature, although notice that (a) and (b) are not independent\nof one another.\n\nIn order for Curie\u2019s principle to be applicable, various\nconditions need to be satisfied: the causal connection must be valid,\nthe cause and effect must be well-defined, and the symmetries of both\nthe cause and the effect must also be well-defined (this involves both\nthe physical and the geometrical properties of the physical systems\nconsidered). Curie\u2019s principle then furnishes a necessary\ncondition for given phenomena to happen: only those phenomena can\nhappen that are compatible with the symmetry conditions established by\nthe principle.\n\nCurie\u2019s principle has thus an important methodological function:\non the one side, it furnishes a kind of selection rule (given an\ninitial situation with a specified symmetry, only certain phenomena\nare allowed to happen); on the other side, it offers a falsification\ncriterion for physical theories (a violation of Curie\u2019s\nprinciple may indicate that something is wrong in the physical\n description).[15]\n\nSuch applications of Curie\u2019s principle depend, of course, on our\naccepting its validity, and this is something that has been questioned\nin the literature, especially in relation to spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking (see below, next section). Different proposals have been\noffered for justifying the principle. We have presented it here as an\nexample of symmetry considerations based on Leibniz\u2019s PSR, while\nCurie himself seems to have regarded it as a form of the causality\nprinciple. In current literature, it has become standard to understand\nthe principle as following from the invariance properties of\ndeterministic physical laws. According to this \u201creceived\nview\u201d, as first formulated in Chalmers (1970) and then developed\nin more recent literature (Ismael 1997, Belot 2003, Earman 2004),\nCurie\u2019s principle is expressed in terms of the relationship\nbetween the symmetries of earlier and later states of a system, and\nthe laws connecting these states. In fact, this is a misrepresentation\nof Curie\u2019s original principle: Curie\u2019s focus was on the\ncase of co-existing, functionally related features of a system\u2019s\nstate, rather than temporally ordered cause and effect pairs. For a\ndiscussion on such questions as to whether there is more that one\n\u201cCurie\u2019s principle\u201d and, independently of how it is\nformulated, what are the aspects that make it so scientically\nfruitful, see Castellani and Ismael (2016). As regards the status\nof the principle, Norton (2016) argues that it is a\n\u201ctruism\u201d, on the grounds that whether the principle\nsucceeds or fails depends on how one chooses to attach causal labels\nto the scientific description. For Roberts (2013), Curie\u2019s\nprinciple fails when the symmetry is time reversal. Roberts (2016)\nclaims that the truth of the principle is contingent on special\nphysical facts, and attributes to its failure an important role in the\ndetection of parity violation and CP violation (on this point, see\nalso Roberts, 2015, and Ashtekar, 2015).\n",
