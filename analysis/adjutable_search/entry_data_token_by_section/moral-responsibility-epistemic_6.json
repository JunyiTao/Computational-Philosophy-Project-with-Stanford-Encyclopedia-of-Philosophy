    "main_text": "Responses to Revisionism || Quality of Will\n3.3 Quality of Will\n\nWe turn now to examine a family of views that resist the regress\nargument by appealing to Strawson\u2019s (1962 [2003]) influential\nidea that praise-/blameworthiness tracks the agent\u2019s quality of\nwill. There are different ways of cashing out what exactly\n\u2018quality of will\u2019 means (Shoemaker 2013), but the basic\nidea is this: an agent is praiseworthy for an action or an attitude\nthat accords with the demands of morality if the performance of the\naction or the holding of the attitude arises from proper regard or\nconcern for another person\u2019s morally significant interests.\nConversely, an agent is blameworthy for an action or attitude that\nconflicts with the demands of morality if the performance of the\naction or the holding of the attitude arises from lack of proper\nregard or concern for those same interests. The key insight that\nquality-of-will theorists bring to bear on the debate over the EC is\nthat an agent need not believe that her action is right/wrong\n(or that she has reasons in favor or against doing it, or that she is\ndoing something morally risky) for the action to express the quality\nof her will and thus for her to be praise-/blameworthy in performing\nit. For example, when an ancient slaveholder beats her slave she\nclearly evinces lack of regard for the slave\u2019s interests, quite\nirrespectively of what her owns views about the permissibility of\nslavery are or whether she has ever paused to consider the issue\n(Rosen 2003: 72). Thus, if an agent\u2019s evinced quality of will is\nall that matters for blameworthiness (something that Rosen denies),\nthe slaveholder is manifestly blameworthy. On this view, then, de\ndicto awareness of the action\u2019s moral significance\nisn\u2019t required for blameworthiness (Fields 1994; Arpaly 2003\n& 2015; Harman 2011 & 2015; Talbert 2013 & 2017a;\nLittlejohn 2014; Mason 2015; Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017b; Weatherson 2019:\nch. 5), and the same goes for praiseworthiness (Arpaly 2003 &\n 2015).[8],\n [9]\n\nWhat kind of awareness is required according to quality-of-will\ntheorists? In their view, when assessing epistemic requirements on\nresponsibility\n\n\nwe should consider what a wrongdoer needs to know in order for her\nactions to express the attitudes and judgments that make blame\nappropriate. (Talbert 2013: 242)\n\n\nQuality-of-will theorists usually agree that for actions to express\nthe relevant attitudes and judgments factual awareness is\nrequired: the agent has to be aware of what she is doing and what the\nprobable consequences of her action are (Talbert 2017a: 47, 53; Harman\n2011: 465; 2015: 67; Arpaly 2015: 151). (Angela Smith 2005 & 2017\ndisagrees, arguing that failures of factual awareness, such as\nforgetting a friend\u2019s birthday, sometimes reveal inadequate\nmoral concern and thus are blameworthy. See also Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017b:\n152. Cf. Holly Smith 2011; Talbert 2017b.) As we just saw, they also\nagree that de dicto moral awareness isn\u2019t required.\nHowever, they disagree on whether de re moral\nawareness\u2014awareness of the action\u2019s right-/wrong-making\nfeatures regardless of whether one conceives them as such\u2014is\nrequired or not. Some think it is (Talbert 2013: 242; 2017a: 53;\nHarman 2011: 465; 2015: 67), while others think it isn\u2019t.\n\nThe clearest advocate of the latter position is Arpaly (2003 &\n2015). In her view, quality of will is essentially related to\nresponsiveness to moral reasons, understood as\n\n\n[wanting] noninstrumentally to take courses of action that have those\nfeatures that are (whether or not [one] describes them this way)\nright-making and not to take courses of action that have those\nfeatures that are (whether or not [one] describes them this way)\nwrong-making features. (Arpaly 2003: 79)\n\n\nThe key claim Arpaly defends is that responding in this sense to moral\nreasons doesn\u2019t require awareness of the features to which one\nis responding. Her central example is the much-discussed case of\nHuckleberry Finn, who helps Jim the runaway slave to escape despite\nbelieving that he is acting wrongly in \u201cstealing\u201d from\nJim\u2019s \u201cowner\u201d. Huck does the right thing and,\naccording to Arpaly, does it for the right reasons, namely in response\nto Jim\u2019s humanity (Arpaly 2003: 77). At the same time, however,\nHuck is unaware that he is helping Jim because he is a person\nlike himself (although he is aware that he is facilitating\nJim\u2019s flight). He \u201cis not capable of bringing to\nconsciousness his nonconscious awareness\u201d of Jim\u2019s\nhumanity (Arpaly 2003: 77), and thus fails to acquire de re\nawareness of the central right-making feature of his action. Since\nHuck seems to be praiseworthy despite lacking moral awareness (both\nde dicto and de re), Arpaly concludes that this kind\nof awareness isn\u2019t required for praiseworthiness, and something\nparallel holds for blameworthiness (Arpaly 2015: 151\u20132).\n\nNot everyone agrees with Arpaly\u2019s verdict on this case, however.\nSliwa (2017) challenges the intuition that Huck is morally\npraiseworthy, arguing that praise is ordinarily bestowed only on those\nagents who intentionally do the right thing. Given that Huck\ndoesn\u2019t know what the right thing to do in his situation is, he\ncan\u2019t do the right thing intentionally (although he\nintentionally performs an action that is in fact right), because\nintentional action incorporates, quite generally, a \u201cknow\nhow\u201d requirement (Sliwa 2017: 128\u201330). Since in the case\nof morally significant actions the required know-how incorporates both\nnon-moral and moral knowledge (2017: 131), this, on Sliwa\u2019s\nview, supports the thesis that praise-/blameworthiness does require\nmoral knowledge (and thus moral awareness). (Zimmerman 2008: 201\nargues that Huck is actually blameworthy, given that he acts\non the belief that his action is overall morally wrong.)\n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize the extent of the disagreement\nbetween quality-of-will theorists and volitionists. The former\ninitially reject thesis iii of the regress argument, since they deny\nthat de dicto awareness of the action\u2019s moral\nsignificance is necessary for praise-/blameworthiness. But this\nrejection ultimately leads them to deny all four of the\nregress argument\u2019s main theses. Since quality-of-will theorists\nmaintain that moral knowledge isn\u2019t required for\npraise-/blameworthiness, they thus hold that moral ignorance (even if\nblameless) doesn\u2019t stand in the way of either praise or blame,\ntherefore denying thesis iv (the Parity Thesis) (Harman 2011: 465;\n2015: 65; Talbert 2013: 242; Arpaly 2015: 151; Weatherson 2019: ch.\n5). Also, since in their view what matters for blameworthiness is\nwhether the agent exhibits ill will in performing some action,\nblameworthiness for ignorant wrongdoing can be direct\u2014it\nneedn\u2019t derive from culpability for ignorance. This amounts to a\nrejection of thesis i when moral ignorance is at stake (Harman 2011\n& 2015; Talbert 2013; Arpaly 2015; Weatherson 2019: ch. 5).\nFinally, and in opposition to thesis ii, some quality-of-will\ntheorists claim that moral ignorance can be directly blameworthy,\ngiven that one\u2019s mistaken moral beliefs may reveal an inadequate\ndegree of moral concern (Harman 2011: 460; 2015: 68; see also Adams\n1985: 19. Cf. Arpaly 2003: 105\u20136). Thus, after rejecting all the\nbasic theses of the regress argument, quality-of-will theorists\nconclude that culpability for ignorant wrongdoing (and for ignorance\nitself) is much more prevalent than volitionists think.\n\nFor instance, on Talbert\u2019s (2013 & 2017a) account it will\noften be the case that morally ignorant wrongdoers are blameworthy,\nbecause\n\n\n[e]ven if a wrongdoer is ignorant of the fact that her behavior is\nwrong, and even if this ignorance is not her fault, her actions may\nstill express the contemptuous judgment that certain others do not\nmerit consideration, that their interests do not matter, and that\ntheir objections can be overlooked. (Talbert 2013: 234)\n\n\nTalbert concedes that if a wrongdoer\u2019s moral ignorance\nisn\u2019t her fault, it may well be the case that she\u2019s unable\nto rationally do the right thing. But far from showing that\nshe\u2019s thus blameless, what this shows according to Talbert is\nthat \u201chaving subjective rational access to avoiding an action is\nnot a requirement on being properly blamed for that action\u201d\n(Talbert 2013: 239; cf. Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017b: 149). This stands in\nsharp opposition to one of the volitionists\u2019 central\nconvictions\u2014a conviction that grounds their commitment to the\nimportance of de dicto moral awareness\u2014namely that\n\u201cIt is unfair to blame someone for doing something if he\nblamelessly believes that there is no compelling moral reason not to\ndo it\u201d (Rosen 2003: 74; see also Levy 2009: 738). Talbert\nresponds to the charge of unfairness by claiming that there is nothing\nunfair in blaming someone who knowingly (in the factual sense) and\ndeliberately has harmed us, even if we concede that it isn\u2019t\nreasonable to expect her to have avoided her moral ignorance and acted\nrightly (Talbert 2013: 238; 2017a: 53. See also Scanlon 2008:\n186\u20138; Arpaly 2003: 172\u20133; 2015: 155; Harman 2015: 66).\nHowever, by divorcing blameworthiness from reasonable expectations\nabout avoiding wrongdoing, Talbert\u2019s position, and that of other\nquality-of-will theorists, is vulnerable to the charge that it misses\nthe crucial connection between blameworthiness and desert, namely that\nblameworthy agents deserve certain negative reactions and\nadverse treatment partly because, and only if, it was reasonable to\nexpect them to do better (FitzPatrick 2017: 33; Levy 2011:\n194\u20135).\n\nIt becomes apparent at this point that the disagreement between\nquality-of-will theorists and the rest concerning the EC is ultimately\ngrounded on different conceptions of responsibility and\nblameworthiness (Wieland 2017a: 5; see the\n Conclusion\n below). On the one hand, philosophers of different persuasions\nregarding the EC\u2014volitionists, weakened internalists, epistemic\nvice theorists, and capacitarians\u2014appeal to elements associated\nwith responsibility as accountability, such as the relevance\nof the agent\u2019s capacities and opportunities to avoid wrongdoing\nand the concomitant reasonable expectations. (Of course, they disagree\nabout how to characterize these elements, and this disagreement partly\nexplains why they have different conceptions of the EC. See for\ninstance the exchanges between FitzPatrick 2008 & 2017 and Levy\n2009 & 2011: ch. 5; between Clarke 2017a and Levy 2017; and\nbetween Robichaud 2014 and Levy 2016.) On the other hand,\nquality-of-will theorists appeal to elements associated with\nresponsibility as attributability, such as the centrality of\nthe agent\u2019s \u201cmoral orientation\u201d (Talbert 2017a: 48)\nor \u201cdeep self\u201d (Wolf 1987) for blameworthiness and the\ncomparative irrelevance of historical factors about how the agent came\nto have the moral orientation or deep self she has (Arpaly 2003:\n172\u20133; Harman 2011: 462; Talbert 2017b: 19) or whether she could\nhave avoided wrongdoing (Scanlon 2008: 186\u20138; Talbert 2017a:\n48). For the distinction between different types of responsibility see\nWatson 1996, Shoemaker 2011, and Zimmerman 2015.\n",
