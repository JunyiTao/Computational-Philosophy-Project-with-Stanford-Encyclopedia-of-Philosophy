    "main_text": "Identity and Applied Ethics || Other Issues in Applied Ethics\n6.3 Other Issues in Applied Ethics \n\n\nThere are at least four other areas of applied ethics that seem to \nbear a relation to personal identity, and we will lay out the issues \nof each very briefly. First, there is a problem of justifying \ntherapeutic treatment for patients with Dissociative Identity \nDisorder (DID, formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder). The \nworry here comes from the attractive thought that each of the \ndistinct personalities of someone with DID is in fact a different \nperson (Wilkes 1988; Dennett 1976). If so, then a therapy that \naims at  eliminating one or more of the alter personalities in\nfavor of one of them would be, prima facie, immoral. (Morton Prince, \none of the first psychologists to work with a DID patient, wrote that\nhis aim was indeed to kill off what he thought of as the \n\u201cnon-real\u201d personalities of his patient, Christine \nBeauchamp. See Prince 1905.) But this verdict is quite \ncounterintuitive: surely the therapist is helping the patient \nwith DID when his work produces only one healthy personality, not \ndoing anything immoral. The issue, then, is about the moral \nramifications of cutting off personal identity in an unusual sort of \nway. In addition, there are intriguing issues regarding identity and \nboth legal and moral responsibility in patients with DID. What if one\nalter commits a crime, say? Is the patient with DID responsible or is\nonly the offending alter responsible? If the latter, how is a fair \npunishment to be effected? (For further discussion of these issues, \nsee Wilkes 1981, 1988; Hacking 1991, 1995; Lizza 1993; Braude 1995, \n1996; Radden 1996; Sinnott-Armstrong and Behnke 2000; Kennett and \nMatthews 2002; and DeGrazia 2005).\n\n\nA second problem has to do with genetic interference. Suppose someone\ncarried the gene for Huntington's disease (HD) and wanted a child. \nThere would be a 50/50 chance her child would inherit the HD gene. If\nthere were genetic intervention available to eliminate the \npossibility of her child carrying the gene, should she undergo it? It\nseems obvious she should, at least until we draw on some metaphysical\nconsiderations about identity. Suppose the genetic intervention \ninvolved waiting until after fertilization and then altering the \ngenome of the fetus. What would be the identity of the \npost-intervention child? Further, if its identity would be different \nfrom the child that would have been brought into existence, \nwould the genetic interference be immoral in virtue of \npreventing that other child's existence? Relevant to the \ndebate here is Saul Kripke's thesis about origins, that one person \ncould not have been someone else (Kripke 1980), and this is a thesis \nwith which advocates of the Biological Criterion of personal identity\nwould likely agree: what makes me the particular individual I am is \nmy biological structure and its origins, and any other combination of\nmy parents' sperm and egg would have produced a different individual.\nThe question here, though, is whether or not some other \nchanges, after the combination of sperm and egg, would be sufficient \nto produce a different individual. And if so, does this bear on the \nmorality of doing so? (For further discussion of these issues, see \nElliot 1993, Persson 1995, Belshaw 2000, Glannon 2001, and DeGrazia 2005:\n244\u2013268.)\n\n\nA third problem is in certain respects closely related. It is the \nnon-identity problem, first discussed in detail in Parfit \n1984, 351\u2013379. Suppose a fourteen-year-old girl decides to have a \nchild. Given her youth, the girl gives her child a bad start in life.\nIf she had waited several years to have a child, that child would \nhave been better off than the one she had. Our intuition is \nthat what the girl has done is wrong. But why? The obvious answer \nwould seem to be that the girl's decision was bad for her \nchild. But this cannot be right, for that child would not even \nhave existed were it not for her decision. It is also clear that she \ndoesn't harm the child that would have existed had she waited, given \nthat something that does not exist cannot be harmed. It thus turns \nout to be very difficult to articulate just what was wrong with the \ngirl's decision, but as Parfit notes, we do not abandon our belief in\nthe wrongness of what the girl did. Instead, \u201cwe cannot defend \nthis belief in the natural way \u2026 suggested\u201d (Parfit \n1984, 359). But finding an alternative defense does not look very \npromising. And applying the non-identity problem on a grander scale \nyields a serious puzzle in population ethics. Suppose governments \naround the world continue to ignore the threat of global warming, so \nthat the lives of people living between 2200 and 2500 are barely \nworth living. Contrast this case with the scenario in which the \ngovernments cooperate to enact regulatory measures that slow down the\nwarming trend and render it a non-threat, but in so doing make the \nlives of people living between 2010 and 2200 of a lower quality than \nthey would otherwise have been. Clearly, it seems the second scenario\nis better, that we ought to bring this scenario about. But on what \nbasis? Far-reaching governmental policies often play a critical role \nin determining the ways and timing in which people get together, so \nthe identities of the members of the populations in each scenario \nwould likely be quite different. If we also assume that we do not \nharm anyone by bringing him or her into existence, then who is harmed\nin the former scenario? Who is made worse off? Given that those \npeople would not have existed had we done something about global \nwarming, they have not been harmed by our inaction. So what moral \nreason can be given in defense of our pursuit of the second scenario?\n(Parfit 1984, 371\u2013377) These are very difficult issues indeed. (For \nfurther discussion, see DeGrazia 2005, 268\u2013279.)\n\n\nFinally, many have argued that considerations of personal identity can\nshed light on the nature of death, which itself plays a key role in\nmoral argumentation (Green and Wikler 1980; Zaner 1988; Puccetti 1988;\nMcMahan 2002; DeGrazia 2005). One popular line of thought, based on\nthe Psychological Criterion, has been that when an individual is at\nthe point when she is no longer able to sustain any psychological\ncontinuity, her identity has ceased, and so she should be considered\ndead. This idea has led many philosophers to advocate for a criterion\nof death known as the \u201chigher brain standard,\u201d according\nto which death occurs at the point of irreversible loss of the\ncapacity for consciousness (e.g., Green and Wikler 1980). This\npsychological criterion of death implies that those in a permanent\nvegetative state are dead, despite their continuing brainstem\nactivities. This philosophically popular view has never, however, been\nadopted anywhere. Those favoring the Biological Criterion advocate a\nview much more in line with actual medical practice. If we are\nessentially human organisms, according to these advocates, then our\ndeath occurs at the point when that organism dies. There is still\nwrangling over when precisely that occurs, however. Some favor a\n\u201cdeath of the whole brain standard,\u201d whereas\nothers, dissenters as DeGrazia labels them, adhere to a\n\u201ccirculatory-respiratory standard,\u201d according to which\n\u201chuman death is the permanent cessation of\ncirculatory-respiratory function\u201d (DeGrazia 2005, 149). It is\nless clear, however, what role personal identity actually plays in\nthis debate. After all, the cessation of my identity may have nothing\nto do with anything like organismic (or brain) death. On any view of\npersonal identity other than four-dimensionalism, recall, I cease to\nexist if I undergo fission. There will be no one in existence who is\nme, but this fact is irrelevant to our thinking about death. It may be\nthe case, then, that seeking the factors involved in cutting off\nsomeone's personal, or human, identity will yield no insights into the\nnature of death itself.
