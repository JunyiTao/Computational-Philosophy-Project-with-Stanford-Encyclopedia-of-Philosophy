    "main_text": "Some Questions about Emerson || Early and Late Emerson\n4.3 Sources and Influence\n\nEmerson read widely, and gave credit in his essays to the scores of\nwriters from whom he learned. He kept lists of literary,\nphilosophical, and religious thinkers in his journals and worked at\ncategorizing them.\n\nAmong the most important writers for the shape of Emerson\u2019s\nphilosophy are Plato and the Neoplatonist line extending through\nPlotinus, Proclus, Iamblichus, and the Cambridge Platonists. Equally\nimportant are writers in the Kantian and Romantic traditions (which\nEmerson probably learned most about from Coleridge\u2019s\nBiographia Literaria). Emerson read avidly in Indian,\nespecially Hindu, philosophy, and in Confucianism. There are also\nmultiple empiricist, or experience-based influences, flowing from\nBerkeley, Wordsworth and other English Romantics, Newton\u2019s\nphysics, and the new sciences of geology and comparative anatomy.\nOther writers whom Emerson often mentions are Anaxagoras, St.\nAugustine, Francis Bacon, Jacob Behmen, Cicero, Goethe, Heraclitus,\nLucretius, Mencius, Pythagoras, Schiller, Thoreau, August and\nFriedrich Schlegel, Shakespeare, Socrates, Madame de Sta\u00ebl and\nEmanuel Swedenborg.\n\nEmerson\u2019s works were well known throughout the United States and\nEurope in his day. Nietzsche read German translations of\nEmerson\u2019s essays, copied passages from \u201cHistory\u201d and\n\u201cSelf-Reliance\u201d in his journals, and wrote of the\nEssays: that he had never \u201cfelt so much at home in a\nbook.\u201d Emerson\u2019s ideas about \u201cstrong,\noverflowing\u201d heroes, friendship as a battle, education, and\nrelinquishing control in order to gain it, can be traced in\nNietzsche\u2019s writings. Other Emersonian ideas-about transition,\nthe ideal in the commonplace, and the power of human will permeate the\nwritings of such classical American pragmatists as William James and\nJohn Dewey.\n\nStanley Cavell\u2019s engagement with Emerson is the most original\nand prolonged by any philosopher, and Emerson is a primary source for\nhis writing on \u201cmoral perfectionism.\u201d In his earliest\nessays on Emerson, such as \u201cThinking of Emerson\u201d and\n\u201cEmerson, Coleridge, Kant,\u201d Cavell considers\nEmerson\u2019s place in the Kantian tradition, and he explores the\naffinity between Emerson\u2019s call in \u201cThe American\nScholar\u201d for a return to \u201cthe common and the low\u201d\nand Wittgenstein\u2019s quest for a return to ordinary language. In\n\u201cBeing Odd, Getting Even\u201d and \u201cAversive\nThinking,\u201d Cavell considers Emerson\u2019s anticipations of\nexistentialism, and in these and other works he explores\nEmerson\u2019s affinities with Nietzsche and Heidegger.\n\nIn Conditions Handsome and Unhandsome and Cities of\nWords, Cavell develops what he calls \u201cEmersonian moral\nperfectionism,\u201d of which he finds an exemplary expression in\nEmerson\u2019s \u201cHistory\u201d: \u201cSo all that is said of\nthe wise man by Stoic, or oriental or modern essayist, describes to\neach reader his own idea, describes his unattained but attainable\nself.\u201d Emersonian perfectionism is oriented towards a wiser or\nbetter self that is never final, always initial, always on the\nway.\n\nCavell does not have a neat and tidy definition of perfectionism, and\nhis list of perfectionist works ranges from Plato\u2019s\nRepublic to Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical\nInvestigations, but he identifies \u201ctwo dominating themes of\nperfectionism\u201d in Emerson\u2019s writing: (1) \u201cthat the\nhuman self \u2026 is always becoming, as on a journey, always\npartially in a further state. This journey is described as education\nor cultivation\u201d; (2) \u201cthat the other to whom I can use the\nwords I discover in which to express myself is the Friend\u2014a\nfigure that may occur as the goal of the journey but also as its\ninstigation and accompaniment\u201d (Cities of Words,\n26\u20137). The friend can be a person but it may also be a text. In\nthe sentence from \u201cHistory\u201d cited above, the writing of\nthe \u201cStoic, or oriental or modern essayist\u201d about\n\u201cthe wise man\u201d functions as a friend and guide, describing\nto each reader not just any idea, but \u201chis own idea.\u201d This\nis the text as instigator and companion.\n\nCavell\u2019s engagement with perfectionism springs from a response\nto his colleague John Rawls, who in A Theory of Justice\ncondemns Nietzsche (and implicitly Emerson) for his statement that\n\u201cmankind must work continually to produce individual great human\nbeings.\u201d \u201cPerfectionism,\u201d Rawls states, \u201cis\ndenied as a political principle.\u201d Cavell replies that\nEmerson\u2019s (and Nietzsche\u2019s) focus on the great man has\nnothing to do with a transfer of economic resources or political\npower, or with the idea that \u201cthere is a separate class of great\nmen \u2026for whose good, and conception of good, the rest of\nsociety is to live\u201d (CHU, 49). The great man or woman, Cavell\nholds, is required for rather than opposed to democracy:\n\u201cessential to the criticism of democracy from within\u201d\n(CHU, 3).\n",
