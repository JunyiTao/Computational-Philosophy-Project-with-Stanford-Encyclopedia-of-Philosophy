    "main_text": "Alternative Frameworks || Narrative and phenomenological approaches\n5.2 Narrative and phenomenological approaches\n\nAmong the numerous humanistic critiques of biomedicine, coming from\nthe broad field of medical humanities (for an overview, see Marcum\n2008), philosophers have paid particular attention to narrative and\nphenomenology (Ferry-Danini 2018).\n\nNarrative medicine offers a revision to the biomedical model\nalternative based around the centrality of the story or narrative in\nhuman life (Charon 2006). This notion that narrative is central to\nhuman experience offers a variety of potential operationalizations in\nclinical biomedical practice. For instance, it places additional value\non the patient consultation and asks for improved active listening\nskills among clinicians, who must learn to elicit, receive, and\nunderstand patients\u2019 stories about their health conditions. Such\nlistening has many potential benefits, including the potential to\nunderstand the meaning(s) of what human dignity means for a given\npatient, an important benefit given that biomedical settings are known\nfor being \u201cdehumanizing\u201d (Parsons & Hooker 2010).\nThough, the proposition that humans are indeed narrative beings has\nitself been disputed (Woods 2011).\n\nAs shown by Carel, phenomenology\u2019s value to medicine comes from\nits insistence on taking illness seriously (Carel 2016).\n\n\n\u2026we must enlist philosophical analysis in order to fully\nappreciate the existential transformation illness brings about. This\ntransformation cannot be accounted for as merely physical or mental\n(in the case of psychiatric disorder) dysfunction. Rather, there is a\nneed for a view of personhood as embodied, situated, and enactive, in\norder to explain how local changes to the ill person\u2019s body and\ncapacities modify her existence globally (Carel 2016: 14).\n\n\nBiomedicine takes illness seriously, but the philosophical framework\nof biomedicine leaves no space for the notions of existential\ntransformation as part of illness\u2014disease is reduced to the\nstate of a system in which there are malfunctioning parts (pathologies\nin body parts).
