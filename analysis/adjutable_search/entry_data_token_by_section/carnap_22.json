Quine and \u201cEmpiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\u201d\n\nThe best-known aspect of Carnap\u2019s reflections on semantics,\nhowever, concern his various controversies with Quine, which addressed\na broad range of issues, two of which have aroused particular\ninterest: ontology and \u201cthe\u201d analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. For many years after Quine launched his critique of\nCarnap, in the 1950s, it was widely agreed that Quine had\n\u201cwon\u201d, and for several decades his paper \u201cTwo Dogmas\nof Empiricism\u201d (Quine 1951) became perhaps the best-known and\nmost widely cited paper in all analytic philosophy. However, since the\nrevival of Carnap studies in the 1980s and 90s, the picture looks\nrather different, and if there is a mainstream opinion on the\nCarnap-Quine debates now, it would probably be something like the\nposition articulated in a series of papers by Richard Creath (1987,\n1990, 1991, 1994, 2007, 2009) to the effect that Quine at least\npartially misunderstood Carnap and that the two philosophers were\nlargely talking past each other (while of course trying hard not\nto).\n\nWith respect to reductionism (the second dogma of empiricism in\nQuine\u2019s 1951), Quine rightly criticized the viability of\nCarnap\u2019s radical reductionism in the\nAufbau\u2014which, however, Carnap himself gave up soon\nafter the Aufbau\u2019s publication. It is much less clear\nwhether Quine is right to attribute a weaker form of reductionism to\nthe later Carnap, as Carnap regards the confirmation of scientific\nhypotheses to be holistic and theory-relative from the Logic\nSyntax at the latest. This is discussed in more detail in the\nsupplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1).\n\nThe other \u201cdogma of empiricism\u201d that Quine discerned in\nCarnap was his adherence to \u201cthe\u201d analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. Unlike Quine, though, Carnap was not primarily interested\nin defining analyticity for natural language, but rather in the\nconstruction of linguistic frameworks for which a coherent notion of\nanalyticity could be defined in precise terms. Nor did Carnap imagine\nthat there was a single unique such distinction; he thought rather\nthat any such distinction had to be language-relative and himself\nconstructed precise definitions of analyticity for a number of\nlinguistic frameworks with different applications. True, Carnap also\nattempted in Syntax to give a general definition of\n\u201canalytic\u201d that would apply to all languages, but\ndid not think even at the time that he had succeeded. He went on\ntrying to find one, but never seriously proposed a solution. So\nQuine\u2019s criticism of Carnap\u2019s lack of definition of\n\u2018analytic-in-language-L\u2019 with variable\n\u2018L\u2019 was definitely sound, but it ran in open doors, as\nCarnap had never claimed to have supplied such a definition even to\nhis own satisfaction. It is a matter of ongoing debate, though,\nwhether Quine\u2019s concerns somehow undermined Carnap\u2019s\ndefinitions of analyticity for particular formal frameworks\nand whether these constructed and language-relative notions of\nanalyticity (the existence of which was of course acknowledged by\nQuine) satisfied the conceptual role that Carnap ascribed to them. In\nany case, Carnap himself did not think that every language had to have\nanalytic sentences. Most sophisticated language frameworks, especially\nthose equipped for scientific statements, would need them, since the\nanalytic sentences are just those that \u201ccome with\u201d the\nframework (by being provable by the rules of the framework without\nfurther assumptions), but it is possible, Carnap thought, to design a\nlanguage that has no analytic sentences. (In terms of a modern\nanalogy: there are systems of non-classical logic, such as\nthree-valued Strong-Kleene logic, which include an interesting and\nwell-defined logical consequence relation, but where the set of\nlogically true statements is empty.) He did not think this worth\npursuing, though, since to him it was obvious that such a language\nwould not be scientifically useful. He often cited Einstein\u2019s\n(1921) insistence that without Hilbert\u2019s strict distinction\nbetween physical geometry and mathematical \u201cpurely\naxiomatic\u201d geometry (the latter of which was regarded as\nanalytic by Carnap), Einstein could never have formulated the theory\nof relativity.\n\nThe debate between Carnap and Quine about analytic and synthetic has\nproduced a flood of commentary, which is still being added to (see,\ne.g., Juhl & Loomis 2010 or Ebbs 2017 for recent discussions,\nProust 1986 [1989] for a broader historical perspective). The main\npoints of the controversy, the main commentators, and Carnap\u2019s\nown view of the matter are discussed in more detail in\n Carnap vs Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction.\n\nOn the subject of ontology, Quine criticized Carnap\u2019s use of\nquantifiers over intensional entities in Carnap\u2019s intensional\nsemantics. Closely related criticisms were voiced by many others,\nespecially including Carnap\u2019s own former Vienna colleague Otto\nNeurath and the Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle, whose review of\nMeaning and Necessity (Ryle 1949) was perhaps the nastiest\nand most vituperative review ever written of anything Carnap wrote.\nCarnap responded (calmly) with his well-known paper \u201cEmpiricism,\nSemantics, and Ontology\u201d (1950a), in which he distinguished\nbetween two understandings of \u201cexistence\u201d attributions,\ninternal and external. Internal ones are framework-relative;\nthey specify a language framework before claiming or denying or\nquestioning the existence of a thing. External existence\nclaims or questions lack such a relativization to a framework. For\nCarnap only internal questions make sense, if you take them literally.\nThus \u201care there infinitely many numbers?\u201d makes sense if\nyou relativize it to a framework such as, for instance,\nZermelo-Frankel set theory\u2014which has an axiom of infinity, so\nthe answer is (trivially) yes. But without such a relativization the\nquestion makes no sense to Carnap\u2014unless, that is, you\nreinterpret it as a practical (normative) question of\ndeciding among frameworks or explications. All of this applies, in\nparticular, to the quantification over abstract entities in a\nframework for semantics, such as intensional semantics. In turn, Quine\nrejected Carnap\u2019s internal/external distinction, which for Quine\nrelied on the analytic/synthetic distinction, as accepting a framework\nwould consist in accepting the sentences that are analytic in the\nframework. Whether the ontological internal/external distinction needs\nto build on the semantic analytic/synthetic distinction has itself\nbecome a topic in recent philosophical work on metaphysical\ndeflationism about existence questions, which takes Carnap\u2019s\nmetaontological views as its historical starting point (see, e.g.,\nThomasson 2014; see the supplement\n Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Sections 2 and 3)\n for further discussion).\n",
