    "main_text": "Other Topics Concerning Indexicals || Quasi-Indicators and Attitude Ascriptions that Seemingly Attribute First-Person Indexical Attitudes\n5.1 Quasi-Indicators and Attitude Ascriptions that Seemingly Attribute First-Person Indexical Attitudes\n\n\nCasta\u00f1eda (1966, 1967) argues that \u2018he himself\u2019 and\n\u2018she herself\u2019 can be used to ascribe first-person\nindexical beliefs and cannot be used to ascribe beliefs that are not\nfirst-person indexical. Consider again the messy shopper, and let\n\\(t_0\\) be the time at which John first utters \u2018He is making a\nmess\u2019.  Casta\u00f1eda would hold that ascription (18) is true\nbut ascription (19) is false.\n\n(17)\n\nJohn [at \\(t_0\\)]: \u201cHe is making a mess.\u201d\n(18)\n\nJohn believed at\n\\(t_0\\) that he was making a mess.\n(19)\n\nJohn believed at \\(t_0\\) that he himself was making a mess.\n\n\n\nCasta\u00f1eda uses the term quasi-indicator for\nexpressions such as \u2018he himself\u2019 and \u2018she\nherself\u2019 that he claims can be used to ascribe (only) indexical\nbeliefs that the subject would express with a first-person pronoun such\nas \u2018I\u2019. Casta\u00f1eda uses \u2018he*\u2019 and\n\u2018she*\u2019 as abbreviations for \u2018he himself\u2019 and\n\u2018she herself\u2019.\n\n\nPerry (2000, Chapter 5) argues that belief attributions containing\n\u2018he himself\u2019 in their \u2018that\u2019-clauses do not\nsemantically require that the subject have a first-person belief.\nInstead, utterances of such belief attributions merely suggest that the\nsubject has a first-person belief. Schlenker (2003), however, claims\nthat some languages other than English contain lexical items that are\nquasi-indicators in Casta\u00f1eda\u2019s sense.\n\n\nThere are other attitude ascriptions that do not contain \u2018he\nhimself\u2019 or \u2018she herself\u2019, but which also seem to\nrequire, or at least strongly suggest, that their subjects have\nfirst-person attitudes. Suppose that John is in a pizza parlor, and\nobserves a customer in a mirror who appears to be too thin to be\nhealthy. John points at him in the mirror and sincerely utters \u2018I\nwant him to eat a large slice of pizza\u2019. John, however, is not\nfeeling hungry, and so he says \u2018I do not want to eat a large\nslice of pizza\u2019. In fact, however, the person that John sees in\nthe mirror is himself. Attribution (20) seems to be true in this\nsituation, whereas attribution (21) seems to be false.\n\n(20)\n\nJohn wants him to eat a large slice of pizza [pointing at John in the mirror].\n(21)\n\nJohn wants to eat a slice of pizza.\n\n\n\n\nSome theorists would claim that (21) is true only if John has a first-person desire, that is,\na desire that he would naturally express with \u2018I want to eat a\nlarge slice of pizza\u2019. Some of these theorists would attribute\nthe seemingly mandatory first-person reading of (21) to the presence of\na silent, pronoun-like expression that serves as a subject for the\nembedded infinitival phrase \u2018to eat a slice of pizza\u2019. This\nsort of pronominal expression is often called \u2018PRO\u2019. For\ndiscussion, see Dowty 1985, Chierchia 1989, and Cappelen and Dever\n2013.\n",
