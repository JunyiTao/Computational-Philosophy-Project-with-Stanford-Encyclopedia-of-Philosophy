    "main_text": "Solidarity in Practice || Socialism\n2.1 Socialism\n\nAs mentioned above, the idea becomes prevalent in the early-nineteenth\ncentury in France. The soil in which the concept first takes root is\nsocialism. The early socialist writers\u2014Robert Owen\n(1771\u20131858), Henri de Saint-Simon (1760\u20131825), and Charles\nFourier (1772\u20131837) (who Marx and Engels would later dismiss as\n\u201cutopian\u201d) were especially influential\u2014decried the\nindividualism and egoism fostered by market society (Claeys 2011). The\nuntethering of markets from constraints of traditional law, social\nstructures, and morality inevitably led, they argued, to social\nconflict and the moral, economic, and cultural degradation of the\nworking classes. They believed that new forms of mutual aid,\ncooperation, and association were needed to bring each functional unit\nof the modern industrial economy together in a mutually supportive\nweb, and prevent the worst effects of the competitive division of\nlabor and the poverty it produces. In 1826, Robert Owen wrote:\n\n\nThere is but one mode \u2026 by which man can possess in perpetuity\nall the happiness which his nature is capable of enjoying,\u2014that\nis by the union and co-operation of all for the benefit of\neach. While mankind remain congregated in large cities and\ntowns, or live in single families apart from their species, each\nhaving distinct and opposite interests, no substantial improvement can\nbe effected in the condition of society. To obtain the full advantages\nof cooperation, men must be associated in small communities, or large\nfamilies, all the members of which shall be united by the bond of one\ncommon interest; the same bond of union connecting each community with\nevery other established on similar principles. (Owen 1826\u201327\n[2016: 69]; see also Leopold 2015)\n\n\nHippolyte Renaud gave this unified, mutually supportive social\ncooperation in the service of each and all a name that formed the\ntitle of his immensely popular summary of Fourier\u2019s works,\nnamely Solidarit\u00e9\n (1842).[6]\n\nIn \u201cSocialism: Utopian and Scientific\u201d (1876), Engels\nrejected the utopians\u2019 for failing to explain how their proposed\nsocieties could ever be realized (1876 [1978: 685ff]). There was no\nbasis for their doctrines or their faith in the empirically verifiable\nlaws of society. Given its association with the\n\u201cutopians\u201d, it is revealing that neither Marx nor Engels\never used \u201csolidarity\u201d as a term in any of their\nsystematic writings. Where they did use the term was in their speeches\nand letters regarding the workingmen\u2019s associations that were\nspringing up everywhere in defense of socialism. In 1872, in a speech\ngiven in Amsterdam after a congress of the First International, Marx\nsays:\n\n\nCitizens, let us think of the basic principle of the International:\nSolidarity. Only when we have established this life-giving principle\non a sound basis among the numerous workers of all countries will we\nattain the great final goal which we have set ourselves. The\nrevolution must be carried out with solidarity; this is the great\nlesson of the French Commune, which fell because none of the other\ncenters\u2014Berlin, Madrid, etc.\u2014developed great revolutionary\nmovements comparable to the mighty uprising of the Paris proletariat.\n(Marx 1872 [1978: 522])\n\n\nAnd, as Karl Kautsky, one of the most influential Marxists in the late\nnineteenth century, writes in the Class Struggle, which was\nthe German Social Democratic Party\u2019s official commentary on the\nproposed Erfurt program of 1891:\n\n\nBut as soon as the workers discover that their interests are common,\nthat they are all opposed to the exploiter, it takes the form of great\norganizations and open battles against the exploiting class.\u2026\nAnd when [these elevating tendencies] have once wakened full\nclass-consciousness in any group of workers, the consciousness of\nsolidarity with all the members of the working-class, the\nconsciousness of the strength that is born of union; as soon as any\ngroup has recognized that it is essential to society and that it dare\nhope for better things in the future,\u2014then it is well nigh\nimpossible to shove that group back into the degenerate mass of beings\nwhose opposition to the system under which they suffer takes no other\nform than that of unreasoned hate. (Kautsky 1892: Ch. 5,\nSecs. 5\u20136; see also Wildt 1999)\n\n\nFrom its early socialist origins, \u201csolidarity\u201d found its\nnatural home as a term describing the unity of workers\u2019\nassociations\u2014a term describing, that is, their mutual\nidentification with one another as exploited, their mutual commitment\nto overthrowing capitalism through organized cooperation, and their\nwillingness to sacrifice for one another in the name of the cause.\n",
