    "main_text": "Justice and Public Health || The Relevance, Or Not, of Individual Responsibility\n2.4 The Relevance, Or Not, of Individual Responsibility\n\nAs we have already noted, not all issues of justice in public health\nare captured by challenges in the setting of priorities or the\nallocation of resources. One persistent issue concerns the extent to\nwhich individuals should be held responsible for their health. For\ninstance, various luck egalitarians argue that people should be\ncompensated for brute luck or various factors outside of their control\nbut should not be compensated for the choices within their control\n(Albertsen 2015; see also the entry on\n justice and bad luck).\n One apparent implication of (unsophisticated) forms of luck\negalitarianism, then, is that individuals are not entitled to the\nresources needed to prevent or treat ill health that is the result of\ntheir own behavior. Instead, when the bad health of some or all of the\npublic is due to an aggregation of self-harming and irresponsible\nchoices, it could be argued that any related public health efforts are\nbetter understood as a matter of beneficence rather than justice, and\nthat justice does not require public health attend to various health\nconditions caused by irresponsible choice. Of course, many luck\negalitarians argue that their view does not yield this implication\n(see Albertsen 2015; Knight 2015; Segall 2010). Nonetheless, this\nobjection to unsophisticated forms of luck egalitarianism is\ninformative, insofar as it reflects a general tension between notions\nof individual responsibility and the appropriate role of public\nhealth.\n\nFraming public health interventions as a matter of beneficence and not\njustice is but one response to self-imposed risks to health. Some go\nfurther and argue that because individuals who engage in self-harming\nbehavior impose costs on the rest of us, as a matter of justice, the\nindividuals who make such choices ought to have to pay to offset these\nextra costs. The kinds of costs of concern include imposing burdens on\npublic health resources that distract from other, more worthy health\nneeds, draining emergency medical services, and increasing medical\ncare costs and health insurance premiums. Cigarette smoking is one\narena where this debate has played itself out. It has been argued, for\nexample, that smokers should pay for the costs they impose on others\nthrough taxes on cigarettes pegged to defray these costs. Another\ntwist on the justice-implications of self-imposed risks focuses on\nrestrictions that can be imposed on risk-takers. For example, some\nproponents of motorcycle helmet laws note that cyclists who ride\nwithout a helmet are more likely to have a serious injury that\nrequires the immediate attention of emergency medical personnel and,\nas a consequence, these experts are not free to provide care to other\nmore prudent patients who are also acutely ill (Bayer and Jones 2007).\nOn this view, mandatory helmet laws, as well as cigarette taxes, are a\nmatter of justice insofar as these policies are aimed at preventing or\noffsetting the costs imposed on the rest of us by those who take\ndiscretionary risks with their health.\n\nMany, however, object to these lines of argument. Some grant that\nindividuals are responsible for their risky health decisions but deny\nthat this licenses the conclusion that justice requires the sorts of\npolicies just described. These critics articulate alternative ways for\npeople to bear the costs of their decisions, including, for example,\nallowing people who engage in risky behaviors to self-insure in some\nway (Flanigan 2014b). A different line of argument, specific to the\nfinancing of health care services, is that the whole purpose of\ncommunity or public support of medical care through health insurance\nschemes or government health care programs is to spread the costs of\nhealth care across the population. These costs should include those\nthat flow from the full range of negative externalities, including\nthose that have their source in what some consider irresponsible,\nrisky behaviors. One way of putting this point is that the entitlement\nto medical care includes medical costs that are incurred by engaging\nin all kinds of behavior, such as working very long hours (Wikler\n1987, 2002). Once the myriad ways in which we impose costs on one\nanother is recognized, this line of argument continues, the focus on\ncertain behaviors is undermotivated or even discriminatory. Indeed, if\nwe look at various behaviors that are often condemned as irresponsible\nhealth decisions in public health policymaking, they are often\nbehaviors associated with disadvantaged or marginalized groups (Wikler\n1987, 2002). For instance, the sugary beverage tax in New York applied\nto soda but not to more expensive but very sugary beverages, such as\nfrappuccinos.\n\nA different concern with arguments that aim to hold individuals\nresponsible for unhealthy choices focuses on the concept of\n\u2018responsibility\u2019 at play, and whether attributions of\nresponsibility are fitting. (Dworkin 1981) Whether, to what extent,\nand in what sense individuals are responsible for risky behaviors is\ncontested at every turn, in part because of both conceptual and\nempirical debates about notions like addiction and voluntariness. For\nyears, scientists and humanists have argued over the concept of\naddiction, and how that concept should play into our views about\nbehaviors like smoking, drinking and the use of drugs. Also thrown\ninto the mix are contested views about the impact on the public of the\nfull force of marketing tools available to industries who peddle\nunhealthy products, and the related imbalance in power and influence\nbetween these industries and the public health institutions that try\nto level the information and influence playing fields.\n\nBut perhaps most fundamental is the mounting epidemiological evidence\nthat unhealthy behaviors are frequently disproportionately represented\nin disadvantaged subgroups of the population. There are many\nstructural explanations why, for example, poor people are more likely\nthan those who are better off to eat poorly, smoke more, exercise less\nand become dependent on drugs and alcohol. As we have already noted,\nmany theorists and activists in public health place a priority,\ngrounded in accounts of the demands of justice, on reducing\ndisparities in health between groups that differ in social and\neconomic advantage and power (Powers and Faden 2006; Venkatapuram\n2019). Indeed, many claim that a central mission of public health is\nto correct for unjust health inequalities (Powers and Faden 2006).\nWhen the root causes of certain unhealthy behaviors are background\ninjustices, responding by imposing additional costs on individuals in\nthose unjust circumstances is perverse and at odds with this central\nmission. (Buchanan 2019,\n Resnik,\u00a02013;\n Arno et\n al.,\u00a01996;\n Hoffman and\n Tan,\u00a02015;\n Nestle and\n Bittman,\u00a02015;\n Pomeranz,\u00a02012.) From this perspective, to penalize\nindividuals who make unhealthy choices due to injustice is to add\ninsult to injury and constitutes victim-blaming.\n\nAs this discussion suggests, much of the work addressing public health\ntakes as its starting point that health-related burdens are often\ncaused by injustices, a point that Margaret-Chen, then\ndirector-general of the WHO, captured well with the following remark:\n\u201cThe social conditions in which people are born, live, and work\nare the single most important determinant of good health or ill\nhealth, of a long and productive life, or a short and miserable\none.\u201d (2008). Inequalities in health frequently exist between\nsocially dominant and socially disadvantaged groups, and they\nfrequently occur in conjunction with other injustices and compound\nthem (Wolff and de-Shalit 2007; Powers and Faden 2006). In many\ncontexts, poverty co-travels with the systematic disadvantage\nassociated with racism, sexism, and other forms of denigrated group\nmembership. However, even when it does not, the dramatic differential\nin material resources, social influence, and social status that is the\nhallmark of severe poverty brings with it systematic patterns of\ndisadvantage that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to\nescape. Even when these patterns are lessened, the life prospects of\npersons living in severe poverty or in dominated groups often continue\nto be far below that of others. In light of the connection between\nother forms of injustice and public health inequalities, in\nparticular, some argue that a critical moral function of public health\nis to vigilantly monitor the health of systematically disadvantaged\ngroups and intervene to reduce the inequalities so-identified as\naggressively as possible. Keeping obligations to such groups at the\nforefront of public health thinking can result in significant changes\nin public health policy.\n\nThe final difficulties for trying to formulate policy that compensates\npeople for bad luck but not for irresponsible decisions are epistemic\nand practical. Even if one grants that there are cases where\nindividuals should be held responsible for engaging in unhealthy\nbehaviors by holding them to book for the costs of their behavior or\ndenying them certain interventions, the fact that many health\nconditions are multi-factorial in their causal origins poses\nsignificant epistemic challenges for formulating responsive public\npolicies. Take lung cancer, for example. There are many people who\nsmoke who do not develop lung cancer and many who have never smoked\nthat do. It is daunting to envision determining for an individual\nperson, let alone groups of people, what causal role risky behavior\nplayed in their becoming ill. Moreover, even if this epistemic\ndifficulty could be resolved, it remains the case that public health\npolicy, like all public policy, is a blunt instrument. We should worry\nthat public health policies that try to ensure that individuals pay\nfor their own irresponsible choices will often fail to penalize\nirresponsible behavior, or, more worrisomely, penalize individuals who\nshould not be held responsible for their ill health. \n",
