    "main_text": "Medieval Empiricism\n4. Medieval Empiricism\n\nIt is hardly surprising, given the influence of Christianity, that\nneither ancient Scepticism nor Epicureanism found much of a following\namong medieval thinkers. Stoicism was influential, but more for its\nmoral teachings than for its view of knowledge. However, the attitudes\nassociated with the medical empiricism of the Hellenistic age did not\nentirely disappear: we find at least hints of these among late\nmedieval writers. A striking example is the polemical work\nAntipocras by Nicholas of Poland (fl. 1278). While\nhimself an educated man, trained within the scholastic tradition and\nassocated with the medical school at Montpellier, Nicholas advocated a\nmedical practice based on experience, praising the knowledge of common\npeople over against that of the scholars. This may have been a\nreaction to the more theoretical style of medicine developing at\nMontpellier as a result of the discovery of works by Galen and some\nArab writers (Eamon & Keil 1987: 195). But for evidence of more\ngeneral empiricist doctrines, we must turn to the followers of\nAristotle.\n",
