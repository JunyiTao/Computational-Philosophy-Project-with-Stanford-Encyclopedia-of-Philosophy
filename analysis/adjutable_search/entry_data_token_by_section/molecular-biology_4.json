The number of base pairs varies widely\namong species. For example, the infection-causing Haemophilus\ninfluenzae (the first bacterial genome to be sequenced) has\nroughly 1.9 million base pairs in its genome (Fleischmann et al.\n1995), while the infection-catching Homo sapiens carries more\nthan 3 billion base pairs in its genome (International Human Genome\nSequencing Consortium 2001, Venter et al. 2001). The history of\ngenomics is the history of the development and use of new experimental\nand computational methods for producing, storing, and interpreting\nsuch sequence data (Ankeny 2003; Stevens 2013).\n\nFrederick Sanger played a seminal role in initiating such\ndevelopments, creating influential DNA sequencing techniques in the\n1950s and 1960s (Saiki et al. 1985; for historical treatments see\nSanger 1988; Judson 1992; Culp 1995; Rabinow 1996; Morange 1998; de\nChadarevian 2002; Little 2003; Garcia-Sancho 2012; Sanger Method of\nDNA Sequencing in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Equally important was Edwin Southern\u2019s development of a method\nto detect specific sequences of DNA in DNA samples (Southern 1975).\nThe Southern Blot, as it came to be known, starts by digesting a\nstrand of DNA into many small DNA fragments; those fragments are then\nseparated (in a process called gel electrophoresis) based on size,\nplaced on filter paper which \u201cblots\u201d the DNA fragments on\nto a new medium, and then chemically labeled with DNA probes; the\nprobes then allow for identification and visualization of the DNA\nfragments (see also The Southern Blot in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Playing off the \u201csouthern\u201d homonym, subsequent blotting\ntechniques that detect RNA and proteins came to be called Northern\nblotting and Western blotting. \n\nIn the mid 1980s, after the development of sequencing techniques, the\nUnited States Department of Energy (DoE) originated a project to\nsequence the human genome (initially as part of a larger plan to\ndetermine the impact of radiation on the human genome induced by the\nHiroshima and Nagasaki bombings). The resulting Human Genome Project\n(HGP) managed jointly by the DoE and the United States National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), utilized both existent sequencing\nmethodologies and introduced new ones (Kevles and Hood 1992, see also\nthe entry on\n the human genome project).\n While the human genome project received most of the public attention,\nhundreds of genomes have been sequenced to date, including the cat\n(Pontius et al. 2007), the mouse (Waterson et al. 2002), rice (Goff et\nal. 2002) and a flock of bird genomes (Zhang et al. 2014). One of the\nmost shocking results of those sequencing projects was the total\nnumber of genes (defined in this context as stretches of DNA that code\nfor a protein product) found in the genomes. The human genome contains\n20,000 to 25,000 genes, the cat contains 20,285 genes, the mouse\n24,174, and rice 32,000 to 50,000. So in contrast to early assumptions\nstemming from the classical period of molecular biology about how\ngenes produced proteins which in turn produced organisms, it turned\nout that neither organismal complexity nor even position on the food\nchain was predictive of gene-number (see the entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n\nThe increased attention to sequencing genomes encouraged a number of\ndisciplines to \u201cgo genomic\u201d, including behavioral genetics\n(Plomin et al. 2003), developmental biology (Srinivasan and Sommer\n2002), cell biology (Taniguchi et al. 2002), and evolutionary biology\n(Ohta and Kuroiwa 2002). What\u2019s more, genomics has been\ninstitutionalized with textbooks (Cantor and Smith 1999) and journals,\nsuch as Genomics and Genome Research. And the human\ngenome project itself has turned its attention from a standardized\nhuman genome to variation between genomes in the form of the Human\nGenome Diversity Initiative (Gannett 2003) and the HapMap Project\n(International HapMap Consortium 2003).\n\nBut just as a number of disciplines \u201cwent molecular\u201d while\nmolecular biology itself was wrestling with the complexities posed by\nsplit genes and overlapping genes, so too are fields going genomic\nwhile genomics itself is wrestling with the complexities posed by how\na mere 20,000 genes can construct a human while a grain of rice\nrequires 50,000 genes (Baedke 2018; Brigandt, Green, and\nO\u2019Malley 2017; Green 2017). A related challenge was making sense\nof the genetic similarity claims. For example, how to interpret the\nfinding that human and pumpkin genomes are 75% similar? Does this\nfinding tell us anything substantive about our overall similarity to\npumpkins (Piotrowska 2009)? To help answer such questions, genomics is\nnow supplemented by post-genomics. There is ongoing debate about what\nactually constitutes post-genomics (Morange 2006), but the general\ntrend is a focus beyond the mere sequence of As, Cs, Ts, and Gs and\ninstead on the complex, cellular mechanisms involved in generating\nsuch a variety of protein products from a relatively small number of\nprotein-coding regions in the genome. Post-genomics utilizes the\nsequence information provided by genomics but then situates it in an\nanalysis of all the other entities and activities involved in the\nmechanisms of transcription (transcriptomics), regulation\n(regulomics), metabolism (metabolomics), and expression (proteomics).\n(See ENCODE Project Consortium 2012; Germain et al. 2014; (see also\nthe entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n\nDevelopments in genomics and post-genomics have sparked a number of\nphilosophical questions about molecular biology. Since the genome\nrequires a vast array of other mechanisms to facilitate the generation\nof a protein product, can DNA really be causally prioritized (see\n Section 2.3)?\n Similarly, in the face of such interdependent mechanisms involved in\ntranscription, regulation, and expression, can DNA alone be privileged\nas the bearer of hereditary information, or is information distributed\nacross all such entities and activities (see\n Section 2.2)?\n And is it appropriate to extrapolate from information about other\nspecies\u2019 genomes to how the human genome operates (see\n Section 3.3)?\n",
