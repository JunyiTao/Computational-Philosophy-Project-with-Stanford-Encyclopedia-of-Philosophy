    "main_text": "Plato's Theories of Soul || The Phaedo's Theory of Soul\n3.1 The Phaedo's Theory of Soul\n\n It is probably true that in mainstream fifth century Greek culture,\nbelief in an afterlife of the soul was weak and unclear (Claus 1981,\n68; Burnet 1916, 248-9). If so, it is fitting that Socrates' arguments\nfor the immortality of the soul, most prominently in the\nPhaedo, are offered to interlocutors who, at the outset of the\ndiscussion, are by no means convinced of the idea. (In fact, in the\nApology, 40c, Socrates himself is presented as being\nnoncommittal about what happens to the soul at death, and even about\nwhether it survives at all.) \u201cMen find it very hard to\nbelieve\u201d, Cebes says at Phaedo 70a, \u201cwhat you said\nabout the soul. They think that after it has left the body it no\nlonger exists anywhere, but that it is destroyed and dissolved on the\nday the man dies.\u201d This view is restated by Simmias (at 77b) as\nthe opinion of the majority (cf. 80d); note that the view includes the\nidea that the soul is a material thing, and is destroyed by being\ndispersed, \u201clike breath or smoke\u201d (70a). Glaucon, in the\nlast book of the Republic (608d), is taken aback by\nSocrates' question,\n\n\n\u201cHaven't you realized that our soul is immortal and never\ndestroyed?\u201d\n\nHe looked at me with wonder and said: \u201cNo, by god, I\nhaven't. Are you really in a position to assert that?\u201d\n\n\n Moreover, apart from the question of immortality or otherwise, there\nis the further question whether the soul, if it does have some form of\nexistence after the person has died, \u201cstill possesses some power\nand wisdom\u201d (Phaedo, 70b; cf. 76c).  Answering both\nquestions, Socrates says not only that the soul is immortal, but also\nthat it contemplates truths after its separation from the body at the\ntime of death. Needless to say, none of the four main lines of\nargument that Socrates avails himself of succeeds in establishing the\nimmortality of the soul, or in demonstrating that disembodied souls\nenjoy lives of thought and intelligence. The arguments have been\ndiscussed in some detail, for instance in Bostock 1986, and for our\npurposes there is no need to state and analyze them systematically. It\nwill suffice to comment selectively on aspects of the arguments that\nbear directly on Plato's conception of the soul. The argument that\nsheds most light on what Plato takes the nature of the soul to be is\nthe affinity argument (78b-80b). This argument confronts head-on the\nwidespread worry that the soul, at or soon after death, is destroyed\nby being dispersed.  It begins by distinguishing between two kinds of\nthings: on the one hand, things that are perceptible, composed of\nparts, and subject to dissolution and destruction; on the other hand,\nthings that are not perceptible, but intelligible (grasped by\nthought), not composed of parts, and exempt from dissolution and\ndestruction. These two categories are obviously mutually exclusive. It\nis not clear whether or not they are meant to be exhaustive.\nMoreover, the category of imperishable, intelligible being is\nexemplified, but not, it seems, exhausted, by Platonic forms such as\nequality, beauty and the like (contra Bostock 1986, 118).\nIntelligible being evidently includes what Socrates calls the divine,\nwhose nature it is to rule and to lead (80a), and there is no\nindication that the forms exhaust the divine, or even include the\ndivine, so understood.  Thus the argument leaves room for the idea\nthat souls are not forms, but are nevertheless intelligible, partless\nand imperishable (contra Robinson 1995, 29). In fact, in\nframing the argument in the way he does Plato furnishes the conceptual\nframework needed for saying that body and soul differ in kind, the one\nbeing perceptible and perishable, the other being intelligible and\nexempt from destruction. However, the argument does not support such a\nstrong conclusion, and Socrates is aware of this.  \n\n What he does, in fact, conclude is that the soul is most like,\nand most akin to, intelligible being, and that the body is most\nlike perceptible and perishable being. To say this is plainly neither\nto assert nor to imply (as Robinson 1995, 30, appears to think) that\nsoul in some way or other falls short of intelligible, imperishable\nbeing, any more than it is to assert or imply that body in some way or\nother falls short of, or rather rises above, perceptible, perishable\nbeing. The argument leaves it open whether soul is a perfectly\nrespectable member of intelligible reality, the way human bodies are\nperfectly respectable members of perceptible reality, or whether,\nalternatively, soul has some intermediate status in between\nintelligible and perceptible being, rising above the latter, but\nmerely approximating to the former. Socrates does seem to take his\nconclusion to imply, or at least strongly suggest, that it is natural\nfor the soul either \u201cto be altogether indissoluble, or nearly\nso\u201d, but, in any case, that the soul is less subject to\ndissolution and destruction than the body, rather than, as the popular\nview has it, more so. If this position can be established, Socrates is\nin a position to refute the popular view that the soul, being composed\nof ethereal stuff, is more liable to dispersion and destruction\nthan the body.  However, as Cebes points out (88b), unless Socrates\ncan establish that the soul is altogether exempt from destruction,\nconfidence of survival in the face of death is misplaced. Socrates'\nsoul may be a great deal more durable than his body, but as long as it\nis not truly imperishable, there can be no guarantee that it will\nsurvive Socrates' impending death. For it might have experienced any\nnumber of incarnations already, and the current one might be its\nlast. So Socrates launches his most elaborate and final argument for\nthe immortality of the soul, which concludes that since life belongs\nto soul essentially, the soul must be deathless \u2014 that is,\nimmortal. \n\n The affinity argument is supposed to show not only that the soul is\nmost like intelligible, imperishable being, but also that it is most\nakin to it. Socrates argues that the soul is like intelligible being\non the grounds that it is not visible and, in general, not perceptible\n(anyhow to humans, as Cebes adds at 79b), and that it shares its\nnatural function with the divine, namely to rule and lead (the body in\nthe one case, mortals in the other). There is a separate argument for\nthe kinship of the soul with intelligible being. When the soul makes\nuse of the senses and attends to perceptibles, \u201cit strays and is\nconfused and dizzy, as if it were drunk\u201d (79c).  By contrast,\nwhen it remains \u201citself by itself\u201d and investigates\nintelligibles, its straying comes to an end, and it achieves stability\nand wisdom. It is not just that the soul is in one state or another\ndepending on which kind of object it is attending to, in such a way\nthat its state somehow corresponds to the character of the object\nattended to. That would not by itself show that the soul is more akin\nto the one domain rather than the other (this is the point of\nBostock's criticism, Bostock 1986, 119). To understand the argument\nproperly, it is crucial to note that when the soul attends to\nperceptibles, it is negatively affected in such a way that its\nfunctioning is at least temporarily reduced or impaired (\u201cdizzy,\nas if drunk\u201d), whereas there is no such interference when it\nattends to intelligibles (cf. Socrates' fear, at 99e, that by studying\nthings by way of the senses he might blind his soul). The claim that\nthe soul is akin to intelligible reality thus rests, at least in part,\non the view that intelligible reality is especially suited to the\nsoul, as providing it with a domain of objects in relation to which,\nand only in relation to which, it can function without inhibition and\ninterference and fully in accordance with its own nature, so as to\nachieve its most completely developed and optimal state, wisdom.\n\n It hardly needs pointing out, then, that the soul, as Plato conceives\nof it in the Phaedo, is crucially characterized by cognitive\nand intellectual features: it is something that reasons, more or less\nwell depending on the extent to which it is disturbed or distracted by\nthe body and the senses; something that regulates and controls the\nbody and its desires and affections, \u201cespecially if it is a wise\nsoul\u201d (94b), presumably in a way that involves, and renders\neffective, judgments about what it is best to do, and how it is best\nto behave; and something that has, as the kind of adornment that is\ntruly appropriate to it, virtues such as temperance, justice and\ncourage (114e f.). However, it should be clear that the soul, as it is\nconceived of here, is not simply the mind, as we conceive of it. It is\nboth broader and narrower than that. It is broader in that Plato\nevidently retains the traditional idea of soul as distinguishing the\nanimate from the inanimate. Two of the four main lines of argument for\nthe immortality of the soul rely not on cognitive or indeed\nspecifically psychological features of the soul, but simply on the\nfamiliar connection between soul and life. According to the cyclical\nargument (70c-72d), being alive in general is preceded by, just as it\nprecedes, being dead.  Socrates takes this to show that a creature's\ndeath involves the continued existence of the soul in question, which\npersists through a period of separation from body, and then returns to\nanimate another body in a change which is the counterpart of the\nprevious change, dying. According to the last line of argument that\nSocrates offers in the Phaedo, the soul is immortal because it\nhas life essentially, the way fire has heat essentially. It is plain\nthat both of these arguments apply to the souls of all living things,\nincluding plants (cf. 70d, 71d). And in the final argument, Socrates\nexplicitly appeals to the idea that it is the soul that animates the\nbody of a living thing (105c): \n\nWhat is it that, when present in a body, makes it living? \u2014 A\nsoul.\n\n Now, as we have seen in some detail, the Greek notion of soul\nincluded the idea of soul as animating body probably as early as the\nsixth century, when Thales attributed soul to magnets. Connections\nbetween the soul and morally significant characteristics such as\ncourage, temperance and justice, and with cognitive and intellectual\nfunctions, notably with planning and practical thought, are firmly\nestablished in fifth century Greek usage. But it is obviously far from\nclear whether the ordinary notion of soul, as it develops from the\nHomeric poems down to the end of the fifth century, is a well-formed,\ncoherent notion, one that can suitably support the very prominent role\nthat Plato assigns to the soul, in the Phaedo as well as in\nother dialogues. Perhaps most pressingly, it is far from clear whether\nwhat distinguishes the animate from the inanimate is the very thing\nthat, in the case of some animate organisms, is responsible for\ncognitive functions such as sense-perception and thought, and that,\nspecifically in the case of human beings, is the bearer of moral\nqualities such as justice, courage and the like. The question is\nneither explicitly raised nor, of course, resolved in the\nPhaedo; but a passage in the Republic (352d-354a), with\nwhich we will be concerned in section 3.2, suggests that Plato took\nthe ordinary notion of soul, in all its richness and bewildering\ncomplexity, to be well-formed and coherent, and to be capable of\nsupporting the requirements of his own theory.\n\n Given the idea that soul is the distinguishing mark of all living\nthings, including plants, the Greek notion of soul is, as we have seen\nalready, broader than our concept of mind. For it is at least\nconceivable, and probably true as a matter of fact, that there are\nliving (hence ensouled) organisms without minds, without, that is to\nsay, desire and cognition by sense or intellect. (Plato appears to\nthink that plants do have minds in this sense, because he takes them\nto exhibit desire and sense-perception (Timaeus 77b), but that\nis presumably supposed to be a matter of empirical fact or inference,\nrather than simply a consequence of the fact that plants have souls.)\n\n\n In another way, the conception of soul that is in evidence in the\nPhaedo is significantly narrower than our concept of mind, in\nthat the soul, as conceived of in this particular dialogue, is not, in\nfact, responsible, or directly responsible, for all of a\nperson's mental or psychological activities and responses, but only\nfor a rather severely limited subset of them. Socrates attributes a\nlarge variety of mental states (etc.) not to the soul, but to the\n(animate) body, such as, for instance, beliefs and pleasures (83d),\nand desires and fears (94d). At the same time, the soul is not\nnarrowly intellectual: it too has desires (81d), even passionate ones\n(such as the nonphilosophical soul's love [er\u00f4s] of the\ncorporeal, 80b), and pleasures as well, such as the pleasures of\nlearning (114e). Moreover, the soul's functions are, as we have seen\nalready, not restricted to grasping and appreciating truth, but\nprominently include regulating and controlling the body and its\naffections (such as beliefs and pleasures, desires and fears), no\ndoubt in light of suitable judgments, arrived at, or anyhow supported\nand controlled, by reasoning. The soul of the Phaedo in fact\nseems to be precisely what in Republic 4 is identified as just\none part of the soul, namely reason, whereas the functions of the\nlower parts, appetite and spirit, are assigned, in the psychological\nframework of the Phaedo, to the animate body. And just as the\nfunctions of reason (in the Republic) and of the soul (in the\nPhaedo) are not restricted to cognition, but include desire and\nemotion, such as desire for and pleasure in learning, so the functions\nof non-rational soul (in the Republic) and of the body (in the\nPhaedo) are not restricted to desire and emotion, but include\ncognition, such as beliefs (presumably) about objects of desire,\n\u2018descriptive\u2019 or (rather) non-evaluative (\u201cthere's\nfood over there\u201d) as well as (contra Lovibond 1991, 49)\nevaluative (\u201cthis drink is delightful\u201d) (cf. Phaedo\n83d).\n\n One somewhat surprising, and perhaps puzzling, feature of the\nPhaedo framework is this. On the one hand, Socrates evidently\ntakes the soul to be in some way responsible for the life of any\nliving organism, and hence presumably for all the various\nactivities (etc.) that constitute, or are crucially involved in, any\norganism's life. On the other hand, he also takes it that there is a\nrestricted class of activities that the soul is responsible for in\nsome special way, such that it is not actually the case that the\nsoul is responsible in this special way for all of the relevant\nactivities that living organisms engage in.  Thus, given the idea that\nthe soul is responsible, in some way or other, for all the life of any\nliving organism, one would certainly expect it to be responsible, in\nsome way or other, for (say) the desires, emotions and beliefs of\norganisms whose lives include such psychological states \u2014 and\nnot just for some restricted subset of these desires, emotions and\nbeliefs, but in fact for all of them. However, Socrates' attribution\nto the soul of all and only desires, emotions and beliefs of\nreason (to use the Republic framework) is actually quite\ncompatible with the view that the soul is responsible for all the\nlife-activities organisms engage in, including, of course, the desires\n(etc.) of what in the Republic framework is the non-rational\nsoul. What Socrates needs is something that can certainly be supplied,\nsome suitable articulation of the different ways in which the soul can\nbe said to be responsible for relevant activities of a living\norganism. One such way is that to be capable of engaging in the\nactivity in question at all, an organism has to be ensouled, perhaps\nensouled in a certain way (for instance, in the way animals are rather\nthan in the way plants are).  Another (stronger) way in which the soul\ncan be responsible for an activity is directly: rather than\nbeing the thing in virtue of which the organism can do or undergo\nsomething or other (for instance, becoming thirsty and forming the\ndesire to drink on that basis), the soul can also perform activities\nin its own right (for instance, contemplating mathematical truths).\nSo, to restate somewhat more clearly: the Phaedo's conception\nof soul is narrower than our concept of mind in the following way. The\nrange of activities (etc.) that the soul is directly responsible for,\nand which may be described as activities of the soul strictly\nspeaking, is significantly narrower than the range of mental\nactivities. It does not include all of a person's desires, nor need it\ninclude all emotional responses, or even all beliefs. One plainly\ncould not have (for instance) \u2018bodily\u2019 desires such as\nhunger and thirst without being ensouled, but that does not mean that\nit must be the soul itself that forms or sustains such desires.  \n\n Once we properly understand the Phaedo's theory of soul, then,\nwe are in a position to see that it offers a psychological framework\nthat is coherent, though far from fully articulated. But we should\nalso note that the theory is somewhat unsatisfactory, in that it\nappears rather strikingly to fail to do justice to the unity of the\nmind. The various activities (etc.) that we characterize as mental or\npsychological, such as (most importantly) desire and cognition, seem\nto be, or manifest themselves to us as being, the activities of a\nsingle integrated subject; they do not (ordinarily) appear to belong\nto a plurality of distinct items that operate more or less separately\nfrom one another.  When Socrates' contemplation of mathematical truths\nis disrupted by an intense desire for food, it does not seem to be the\ncase that it is one thing (say, his soul) that has been doing the\ncontemplating and another thing (say, his body) that now wants to get\nsomething to eat. It is rather that both contemplation and desire to\neat seem to belong to one integrated subject, regardless of whether we\nwish to say that the subject in question is Socrates' mind, or whether\nwe prefer to say that it is Socrates insofar as he has a mind (or\nsomething like that). As things are, the psychological theory of the\nPhaedo assigns Socrates' contemplation directly to his soul,\nbut leaves his desire for food curiously remote from it, apparently\ntaking \u2018bodily\u2019 desire (for instance) to be related to the\nsoul in much the same way in which the operations involved in (say)\nmetabolism and growth are so related. (Those too take place only\nbecause his body is ensouled.) It is plausible, though not certain,\nthat Plato felt the force of this problem. It is, in any case,\nresolved by the new theory of soul that the Republic\npresents. \n",
