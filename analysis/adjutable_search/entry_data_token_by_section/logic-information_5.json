    "main_text": "Information as Correlation: Situation Theory || Situations and Supporting Information\n2.1 Situations and Supporting Information\n\nThe ontologies in (a) span a wide spectrum of entities. They are meant\nto reflect a particular way in which an agent may carve up a system.\nHere \u201ca system\u201d can be the world, or a part or aspect of\nit, while the agent (or kind of agent) can be an animal species, a\ndevice, a theorist, etc. The list of basic entities includes\nindividuals, relations (which come with roles attached to them),\ntemporal and spacial locations, and various other things. Distinctive\namong them are the situations and infons.\n\nRoughly speaking, situations are highly structured parts of a system,\nsuch as a class session, a scene as seen from a certain perspective, a\nwar, etc. Situations are the basic supporters of information. Infons,\non the other hand, are the informational issues that situations may or\nmay not support. The simplest kind of informational issue is whether\nsome entities \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\) stand (or do not stand) in a\nrelation \\(R\\) when playing the roles \\(r_1 , \\ldots ,r_n\\),\nrespectively. Such basic infon is usually denoted as \n\\[ \\llangle R, r_1 : a_1 , \\ldots ,r_n : a_n, i\\rrangle. \\]\n\n\nwhere \\(i\\) is 1 or 0, according to whether the issue is positive or\nnegative.\n\nInfons are not intrinsic bearers of truth, and they are not claims\neither. They are simply informational issues that may or may not be\nsupported by particular situations. We\u2019ll write \\(s \\models\n\\sigma\\) to mean that the situation \\(s\\) supports the infon\n\\(\\sigma\\). As an example, a successful transaction whereby Mary\nbought a piece of cheese in the local market is a situation that\nsupports the infon \n\\[ \\sigma = \\llangle bought, what : cheese, who : Mary, 1\\rrangle. \\]\n\n\nThis situation does not support the infon \n\\[ \\llangle bought, what : cheese, who : Mary, 0\\rrangle \\]\n\n\nbecause Mary did buy cheese. Nor does the situation support the\ninfon \n\\[ \\llangle landed, who : Armstrong, where : Moon, 1\\rrangle, \\]\n\n\nbecause Armstrong is not part of the situation in question at all.\n\nThe discrimination or individuation of a situation by an agent does\nnot entail that the agent has full information about it: when we\nwonder whether the local market is open, we have individuated a\nsituation about which we actually lack some information. See\nTextor (2012) for a detailed discussion on the nature of\nsituation-like entities and their relation with other ontological\ncategories such as the possible worlds used in modal logic.\n\nBesides individuals, relations, locations, situations and basic\ninfons, there are various kinds of parametric and abstract entities.\nFor example, there is a mechanism of type abstraction.\nAccording to it, if \\(y\\) is a parameter for situations, then\n\n\\[ T_y = [y \\mid y \\models \\llangle bought, what : cheese, who : x, 1\\rrangle] \\]\n\n\nis the type of situations where somebody buys cheese. There will be\nsome basic types in an ontology, and many other types obtained via\nabstraction, as just described.\n\nThe collection of ontology entities also includes propositions and\nconstraints. They are key in the formulation of the basic principles\nof information content in situation theory, to be introduced next.\n",
