This means that outcomes identified as\n\u201crational\u201d in a particular informational context will\ndepend, in part, on these higher-order beliefs. Both game\ntheorists and logicians have extensively discussed different notions\nof knowledge and belief for a group, such as common knowledge and\nbelief. In this section, we briefly recount the standard definition of\ncommon knowledge. For more information and pointers to the relevant\nliterature, see Vanderschraaf & Sillari (2009) and Fagin et al.,\n(1995: ch. 6).\nConsider the statement \u201ceveryone in group \\(I\\) knows that\n\\(E\\)\u201d. This is formally defined as follows:\n\\[\nK_I(E)\\ \\ :=\\ \\ \\bigcap_{i\\in I}K_i(E)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(I\\) is any nonempty set of players. If \\(E\\) is common\nknowledge for the group \\(I\\), then not only does everyone in the group\nknow that \\(E\\) is true, but this fact is completely transparent to all\nmembers of the group. We first define \\(K_I^n(E)\\) for each \\(n\\ge 0\\) by\ninduction:\n\\[\n K_I^0(E)=E \\qquad{\\text{and for \\(n\\ge 1\\),}}\\quad \n K_I^n(E)=K_I(K^{n-1}_I(E)\n\\]\n\nThen, following Aumann (1976), common knowledge of\n\\(E\\) is defined as the following infinite conjunction:\n\n\\[\nC_I(E)=\\bigcap_{n\\ge 0}K_I^n(E)\n\\]\n\nUnpacking the definitions, we have \n\n\\[\nC_I(E)=E\\cap K_I\\phi(E) \\cap K_I(K_I(E)) \\cap K_I(K_I(K_I(E)))\\cap \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThe approach to defining common knowledge outlined above can be\nviewed as a recipe for defining common (robust/strong) belief (simply\nreplace the knowledge operators \\(K_i\\) with the appropriate belief\noperator). See Bonanno (1996) and Lismont & Mongin (1994, 2003)\nfor more information about the logic of common belief. Although we do\nnot discuss it in this entry, a probabilistic variant of common belief\nwas introduced by Monderer & Samet (1989).\n",
