    "main_text": "Positive research programmes in philosophy of language || Hermeneutical Injustice\n2.5 Generics\n\nGeneric statements are ones such as \u201ccats are furry\u201d, or\n\u201ca cat has fur\u201d, which are neither universal\ngeneralizations (there are furless cats) nor existential\ngeneralization (the claim being made is clearly stronger). They give\nrise to many puzzles, which have for some time interested both\nlinguists and philosophers. For a fuller discussion of generics, see\n the entry on generics.\n Our focus here is the social and political import that has recently\nbeen suggested for generic statements about social groups, on which\nthere is a growing literature. This literature takes as its starting\npoint Sarah-Jane Leslie\u2019s work (Leslie 2015; Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes 2015). Of key interest here are examples such as \u201cboys\ndon\u2019t cry\u201d or \u201cwomen place their families before\ntheir careers\u201d. These sentences can be used to express merely\ndescriptive claims\u2014describing, for example, crying as something\nnot that many boys do. But they can also be used to make normative\nclaims about what boys or women should do. Wodak, Leslie, and\nRhodes (2015) suggest that \u201cwe can understand the difference\nbetween normative and descriptive generics in terms of the different\nconcepts picked out by the noun phrase in the generics\nthemselves\u201d (Wodak et. al. 2015: 629). \u2018Woman\u2019 may\npick out a normative concept\u2014an ideal, which might include such\nthings as a focus on family over career; or, alternatively, it may\npick out a descriptive concept, and refer to women regardless of\nwhether they focus on family over career. Leslie uses this as a\nfoundation for explaining utterances like \u201cHillary Clinton is\nthe only man in the Obama White House\u201d, suggesting that\n\u2018man\u2019 here refers to the ideal of manliness. It is also a\npart of a more general project of arguing that generic utterances have\nharmful effects on social cognition. Leslie (forthcoming) also\ndiscusses what she calls \u201cstriking property generics\u201d,\nstatements that attribute dangerous properties to groups generically\nspecified\u2014like \u201cblack people are dangerous\u201d or\n\u201cMuslims are terrorists\u201d. She argues that striking\nproperty generic claims may not require many instances to be accepted\nas true (assuming some other conditions are also met) allowing them to\nserve as a key mechanism in perpetuating and exacerbating prejudice.\n(For some criticisms of Leslie on striking property generics, see Saul\nforthcoming and Sterken 2015a,b.)\n\nHaslanger (2011) has built on Leslie\u2019s work, arguing that\ngeneric claims often carry conversational implicatures about natures,\nand that these help them to serve as a key mechanism for perpetuating\nthe ideologies that hold unjust social structures in place. She\nsuggests that\u2014whatever their truth conditions (one understanding\nof Leslie\u2019s view would make striking property generic claims\nvery easily true)\u2014one should deny them via the mechanism of\nmeta-linguistic negation (Horn 1985) which allows the denial of a\nclaim because it carries a false implicature. By this method, we can\nstart to disrupt the ideologies that have us in their grip. (For\ncriticism of this, see Saul forthcoming).\n",
