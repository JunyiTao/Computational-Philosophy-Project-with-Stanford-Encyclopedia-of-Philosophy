    "main_text": "\n\nCharles Hartshorne (pronounced Harts-horne) is considered by many\nphilosophers to be one of the most important philosophers of religion\nand metaphysicians of the twentieth century. Although Hartshorne often\ncriticized the metaphysics of substance found in medieval philosophy,\nhe was very much like medieval thinkers in developing a philosophy\nthat was theocentric. Throughout his career he defended the\nrationality of theism and for several decades was almost alone in\ndoing so among English-language philosophers. Hartshorne was also one\nof the thinkers responsible for the rediscovery of St. Anselm\u2019s\nontological argument. But his most influential contribution to\nphilosophical theism did not concern arguments for the\nexistence of God, but rather was related to a theory of the\nactuality of God, i.e., how God exists. In\ntraditional or classical theism, God was seen as the supreme,\nunchanging being, but in Hartshorne\u2019s process-based or\nneoclassical conception, God is seen as supreme becoming in which\nthere is a factor of supreme being. That is, we humans change for a\nwhile, whereas God always changes, Hartshorne maintains. The\nneoclassical view of Hartshorne has influenced the way many\nphilosophers understand the concept of God. In fact, a small number of\nscholars\u2014some philosophers and some theologians\u2014think of\nhim as the greatest metaphysician of the second half of the twentieth\ncentury, yet, with a few exceptions to be treated below, his work has\nhad limited influence\u00a0among analytic philosophers who are\ntheists.\n",
