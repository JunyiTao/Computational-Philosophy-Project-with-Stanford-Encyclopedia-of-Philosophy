    "main_text": "\n\nThe topic of scientific revolutions has been philosophically important\nsince Thomas Kuhn\u2019s account in The Structure of Scientific\nRevolutions (1962, 1970). Kuhn\u2019s death in 1996 and the\nfiftieth anniversary of Structure in 2012 have renewed\nattention to the issues raised by his work. It is controversial\nwhether or not there have been any revolutions in the strictly Kuhnian\nsense. It is also controversial what exactly a Kuhnian revolution is,\nor would be. Although talk of revolution is often exaggerated, most\nanalysts agree that there have been transformative scientific\ndevelopments of various kinds, whether Kuhnian or not. However, there\nis considerable disagreement about their import. The existence and\nnature of scientific revolutions is a topic that raises a host of\nfundamental questions about the sciences and how to interpret them, a\ntopic that intersects most of the major issues that have concerned\nphilosophers of science and their colleagues in neighboring science\nand technology studies disciplines. Even if the so-called Scientific\nRevolution from Copernicus to Newton fits the attractive,\nEnlightenment picture of the transition from feudalism to modernity (a\nclaim that is also contested), the putative revolutions in mature\nsciences (e.g., relativity and quantum mechanics) challenge this\nEnlightenment vision of permanent rational and methodological\nstandards underlying objective sciences and technologies that lead\nsociety along the path of progress toward the truth about the world.\nToday\u2019s scientific realists are the most visible heirs of this\npicture. Although many philosophers and philosophically or\nhistorically reflective scientists had commented on the dramatic\ndevelopments in twentieth-century physics, it was not until Kuhn that\nsuch developments seemed so epistemologically and ontologically\ndamaging as to seriously challenge traditional conceptions of\nscience\u2014and hence our understanding of knowledge acquisition\ngenerally. Why it was Kuhn\u2019s work and its timing that made the\nmajor difference are themselves interesting questions for\ninvestigation, given that others (e.g., Wittgenstein, Fleck,\nBachelard, Polanyi, Toulmin, and Hanson) had already broached\nimportant \u201cKuhnian\u201d themes.\n\nWas there a Scientific Revolution that replaced pre-scientific\nthinking about nature and society and thus marked the transition to\nmodernity? Which later developments, if any, are truly revolutionary?\nAre attributions of revolution usually a sign of insufficient\nhistoriographical understanding? In any case, how are such episodes to\nbe explained historically and epistemologically? Are they contingent,\nthat is, historical accidents and thus perhaps avoidable; or are they\nsomehow necessary to a \u201cprogressive\u201d science? And, if so,\nwhy? Is there an overall pattern of scientific development? If so, is\nit basically one of creative displacement, as Kuhn claimed? Do all\nrevolutions have the same structure and function, or are there diverse\nforms of rupture, discontinuity, or rapid change in science? Do they\nrepresent great leaps forward or, on the contrary, does their\nexistence undercut the claim that science progresses? Does the\nexistence of revolutions in mature sciences support a postmodern or\n\u201cpost-critical\u201d (Polanyi) rather than a modern,\nneo-Enlightenment conception of science in relation to other human\nenterprises? Does their existence support a strongly constructionist\nversus a realist conception of scientific knowledge claims? Are\nrevolutions an exercise in rationality or are they so excessive as to\nbe labeled irrational? Do they invite epistemological relativism? What\nare the implications of revolution for science policy? This entry will\nsurvey some but not all of these issues.\n",
