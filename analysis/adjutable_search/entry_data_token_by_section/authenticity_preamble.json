    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u2018authentic\u2019 is used either in the strong sense of\nbeing \u201cof undisputed origin or authorship\u201d, or in a weaker\nsense of being \u201cfaithful to an original\u201d or a\n\u201creliable, accurate representation\u201d. To say that something\nis authentic is to say that it is what it professes to be, or what it\nis reputed to be, in origin or authorship. But the distinction between\nauthentic and derivative is more complicated when discussing\nauthenticity as a characteristic attributed to human beings. For in\nthis case, the question arises: What is it to be oneself, at one with\noneself, or truly representing one\u2019s self? The multiplicity of\npuzzles that arise in conjunction with the conception of authenticity\nconnects with metaphysical, epistemological, and moral issues (for\nrecent discussion, see Newman and Smith 2016; Heldke and Thomsen\n2014). On the one hand, being oneself is inescapable, since whenever\none makes a choice or acts, it is oneself who is doing these things.\nBut on the other hand, we are sometimes inclined to say that some of\nthe thoughts, decisions and actions that we undertake are not\nreally one\u2019s own and are therefore not genuinely\nexpressive of who one is. Here, the issue is no longer of metaphysical\nnature, but rather about moral-psychology, identity and\nresponsibility.\n\nWhen used in this latter sense, the characterization describes a\nperson who acts in accordance with desires, motives, ideals or beliefs\nthat are not only hers (as opposed to someone else\u2019s), but that\nalso express who she really is. Bernard Williams captures this when he\nspecifies authenticity as \u201cthe idea that some things are in some\nsense really you, or express what you are, and others\naren\u2019t\u201d (quoted in Guignon 2004: viii).\n\nBesides being a topic in philosophical debates, authenticity is also a\npervasive ideal that impacts social and political thinking.\nIn fact, one distinctive feature of recent Western intellectual\ndevelopments has been a shift to what is called the \u201cage of\nauthenticity\u201d (Taylor 2007; Ferrarra 1998). Therefore,\nunderstanding the concept also involves investigating its historical\nand philosophical sources and on the way it impacts the\nsocio-political outlook of contemporary societies.\n",
