Plantinga 1973; Plantinga 1974,\n94\u201397; van Inwagen 1985).\n\nFor one thing, we may point to the fact that it is doubtful that, in\norder to understand the claim that there is some past time at\nwhich Angela Merkel is a baby, we have to be able to answer the\nquestion \u2018What does it take for an infant at some past time to\nbe identical with Merkel?\u2019 in any informative way. Secondly, it\nmay be proposed that in order to understand the claim that there is\nsome possible world in which George Eliot is a scientist, we can rely\non our prior understanding of the claim that she might have been a\nscientist (cf. Kripke 1980, 48, note 15; van Inwagen 1985).\n",
