    "main_text": "The Paradox of Positive Liberty\n2. The Paradox of Positive Liberty\n\nMany liberals, including Berlin, have suggested that the positive\nconcept of liberty carries with it a danger of authoritarianism.\nConsider the fate of a permanent and oppressed minority. Because the\nmembers of this minority participate in a democratic process\ncharacterized by majority rule, they might be said to be free on the\ngrounds that they are members of a society exercising self-control\nover its own affairs. But they are oppressed, and so are surely\nunfree. Moreover, it is not necessary to see a society as democratic\nin order to see it as self-controlled; one might instead adopt an\norganic conception of society, according to which the collectivity is\nto be thought of as a living organism, and one might believe that this\norganism will only act rationally, will only be in control of itself,\nwhen its various parts are brought into line with some rational plan\ndevised by its wise governors (who, to extend the metaphor, might be\nthought of as the organism\u2019s brain). In this case, even the\nmajority might be oppressed in the name of liberty.\n\nSuch justifications of oppression in the name of liberty are no mere\nproducts of the liberal imagination, for there are notorious\nhistorical examples of their endorsement by authoritarian political\nleaders. Berlin, himself a liberal and writing during the cold war,\nwas clearly moved by the way in which the apparently noble ideal of\nfreedom as self-mastery or self-realization had been twisted and\ndistorted by the totalitarian dictators of the twentieth century\n\u2014 most notably those of the Soviet Union \u2014 so as to claim\nthat they, rather than the liberal West, were the true champions of\nfreedom. The slippery slope towards this paradoxical conclusion\nbegins, according to Berlin, with the idea of a divided self. To\nillustrate: the smoker in our story provides a clear example of a\ndivided self, for she is both a self that desires to get to an\nappointment and a self that desires to get to the tobacconists, and\nthese two desires are in conflict. We can now enrich this story in a\nplausible way by adding that one of these selves \u2014 the keeper of\nappointments \u2014 is superior to the other: the self that is a\nkeeper of appointments is thus a \u2018higher\u2019 self, and the\nself that is a smoker is a \u2018lower\u2019 self. The higher self\nis the rational, reflecting self, the self that is capable of moral\naction and of taking responsibility for what she does. This is the\ntrue self, for rational reflection and moral responsibility are the\nfeatures of humans that mark them off from other animals. The lower\nself, on the other hand, is the self of the passions, of unreflecting\ndesires and irrational impulses. One is free, then, when one\u2019s\nhigher, rational self is in control and one is not a slave to\none\u2019s passions or to one\u2019s merely empirical self. The next\nstep down the slippery slope consists in pointing out that some\nindividuals are more rational than others, and can therefore know best\nwhat is in their and others\u2019 rational interests. This allows\nthem to say that by forcing people less rational than themselves to do\nthe rational thing and thus to realize their true selves, they are in\nfact liberating them from their merely empirical desires.\nOccasionally, Berlin says, the defender of positive freedom will take\nan additional step that consists in conceiving of the self as wider\nthan the individual and as represented by an organic social whole\n\u2014 \u201ca tribe, a race, a church, a state, the great society\nof the living and the dead and the yet unborn\u201d. The true\ninterests of the individual are to be identified with the interests of\nthis whole, and individuals can and should be coerced into fulfilling\nthese interests, for they would not resist coercion if they were as\nrational and wise as their coercers. \u201cOnce I take this\nview\u201d, Berlin says, \u201cI am in a position to ignore the\nactual wishes of men or societies, to bully, oppress, torture in the\nname, and on behalf, of their \u2018real\u2019 selves, in the secure\nknowledge that whatever is the true goal of man ... must be identical\nwith his freedom\u201d (Berlin 1969, pp. 132\u201333).\n\nThose in the negative camp try to cut off this line of reasoning at\nthe first step, by denying that there is any necessary relation\nbetween one\u2019s freedom and one\u2019s desires. Since one is free\nto the extent that one is externally unprevented from doing things,\nthey say, one can be free to do what one does not desire to do. If\nbeing free meant being unprevented from realizing one\u2019s desires,\nthen one could, again paradoxically, reduce one\u2019s unfreedom by\ncoming to desire fewer of the things one is unfree to do. One could\nbecome free simply by contenting oneself with one\u2019s situation. A\nperfectly contented slave is perfectly free to realize all of her\ndesires. Nevertheless, we tend to think of slavery as the opposite of\nfreedom. More generally, freedom is not to be confused with happiness,\nfor in logical terms there is nothing to stop a free person from being\nunhappy or an unfree person from being happy. The happy person might\nfeel free, but whether they are free is another\nmatter (Day, 1970). Negative theorists of freedom therefore tend to\nsay not that having freedom means being unprevented from doing as one\ndesires, but that it means being unprevented from doing whatever one\nmight desire to do (Steiner 1994. Cf. Van Parijs 1995; Sugden\n2006).\n\nSome theorists of positive freedom bite the bullet and say that the\ncontented slave is indeed free \u2014 that in order to be free the\nindividual must learn, not so much to dominate certain merely\nempirical desires, but to rid herself of them. She must, in other\nwords, remove as many of her desires as possible. As Berlin puts it,\nif I have a wounded leg \u2018there are two methods of freeing myself\nfrom pain. One is to heal the wound. But if the cure is too difficult\nor uncertain, there is another method. I can get rid of the wound by\ncutting off my leg\u2019 (1969, pp. 135\u201336). This is the\nstrategy of liberation adopted by ascetics, stoics and Buddhist sages.\nIt involves a \u2018retreat into an inner citadel\u2019 \u2014 a\nsoul or a purely noumenal self \u2014 in which the individual is\nimmune to any outside forces. But this state, even if it can be\nachieved, is not one that liberals would want to call one of freedom,\nfor it again risks masking important forms of oppression. It is, after\nall, often in coming to terms with excessive external limitations in\nsociety that individuals retreat into themselves, pretending to\nthemselves that they do not really desire the worldly goods or\npleasures they have been denied. Moreover, the removal of desires may\nalso be an effect of outside forces, such as brainwashing, which we\nshould hardly want to call a realization of freedom.\n\nBecause the concept of negative freedom concentrates on the external\nsphere in which individuals interact, it seems to provide a better\nguarantee against the dangers of paternalism and authoritarianism\nperceived by Berlin. To promote negative freedom is to promote the\nexistence of a sphere of action within which the individual is\nsovereign, and within which she can pursue her own projects subject\nonly to the constraint that she respect the spheres of others.\nHumboldt and Mill, both advocates of negative freedom, compared the\ndevelopment of an individual to that of a plant: individuals, like\nplants, must be allowed to grow, in the sense of developing their own\nfaculties to the full and according to their own inner logic. Personal\ngrowth is something that cannot be imposed from without, but must come\nfrom within the individual.\n",
