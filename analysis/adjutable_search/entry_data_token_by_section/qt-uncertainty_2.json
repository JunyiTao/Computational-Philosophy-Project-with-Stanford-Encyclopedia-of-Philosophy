    "main_text": "Heisenberg || Heisenberg\u2019s argument\n2.2 Heisenberg\u2019s argument\n\nLet us now look at the argument that led Heisenberg to his uncertainty\nrelations. He started by redefining the notion of\nAnschaulichkeit. Whereas Schr\u00f6dinger associated this\nterm with the provision of a causal space-time picture of the\nphenomena, Heisenberg, by contrast, declared:\n\n\nWe believe we have gained anschaulich understanding of a\nphysical theory, if in all simple cases, we can grasp the experimental\nconsequences qualitatively and see that the theory does not lead to\nany contradictions. Heisenberg 1927: 172)\n\n\nHis goal was, of course, to show that, in this new sense of the word,\nmatrix mechanics could lay the same claim to Anschaulichkeit\nas wave mechanics.\n\nTo do this, he adopted an operational assumption: terms like\n\u201cthe position of a particle\u201d have meaning only if one\nspecifies a suitable experiment by which \u201cthe position of a\nparticle\u201d can be measured. We will call this assumption the\n\u201cmeasurement=meaning principle\u201d. In general, there is no\nlack of such experiments, even in the domain of atomic physics.\nHowever, experiments are never completely accurate. We should be\nprepared to accept, therefore, that in general the meaning of these\nquantities is also determined only up to some characteristic\ninaccuracy.\n\nAs an example, he considered the measurement of the position of an\nelectron by a microscope. The accuracy of such a measurement is\nlimited by the wave length of the light illuminating the electron.\nThus, it is possible, in principle, to make such a position\nmeasurement as accurate as one wishes, by using light of a very short\nwave length, e.g., \\(\\gamma\\)-rays. But for \\(\\gamma\\)-rays, the\nCompton effect cannot be ignored: the interaction of the electron and\nthe illuminating light should then be considered as a collision of at\nleast one photon with the electron. In such a collision, the electron\nsuffers a recoil which disturbs its momentum. Moreover, the shorter\nthe wave length, the larger is this change in momentum. Thus, at the\nmoment when the position of the particle is accurately known,\nHeisenberg argued, its momentum cannot be accurately known:\n\n\nAt the instant of time when the position is determined, that is, at\nthe instant when the photon is scattered by the electron, the electron\nundergoes a discontinuous change in momentum. This change is the\ngreater the smaller the wavelength of the light employed, i.e., the\nmore exact the determination of the position. At the instant at which\nthe position of the electron is known, its momentum therefore can be\nknown only up to magnitudes which correspond to that discontinuous\nchange; thus, the more precisely the position is determined, the less\nprecisely the momentum is known, and conversely. (Heisenberg 1927:\n174\u20135)\n\n\nThis is the first formulation of the uncertainty principle. In its\npresent form it is an epistemological principle, since it limits what\nwe can know about the electron. From \u201celementary\nformulae of the Compton effect\u201d Heisenberg estimated the\n\u201cimprecisions\u201d to be of the order \n\n\\[\\tag{2} \\delta p\\delta q \\sim h\\]\n\n\nHe continued: \u201cIn this circumstance we see the direct\nanschaulich content of the relation \\(\\boldsymbol{QP} -\n\\boldsymbol{PQ} = i\\hslash\\).\u201d\n\nHe went on to consider other experiments, designed to measure other\nphysical quantities and obtained analogous relations for time and\nenergy: \n\n\\[\\tag{3} \\delta t \\delta E \\sim h\\]\n\n and action \\(J\\) and angle \\(w\\) \n\n\\[\\tag{4} \\delta w \\delta J \\sim h\\]\n\n which\nhe saw as corresponding to the \u201cwell-known\u201d relations\n\n\\[\\tag{5} \n\\boldsymbol{tE} - \\boldsymbol{Et} = \n i\\hslash \\text{ or } \\boldsymbol{wJ} - \\boldsymbol{Jw} = i\\hslash\\]\n\n\nHowever, these generalisations are not as straightforward as\nHeisenberg suggested. In particular, the status of the time variable\nin his several illustrations of relation\n (3)\n is not at all clear (Hilgevoord 2005; see also\n Section 2.5).\n\nHeisenberg summarized his findings in a general conclusion: all\nconcepts used in classical mechanics are also well-defined in the\nrealm of atomic processes. But, as a pure fact of experience (rein\nerfahrungsgem\u00e4\u00df), experiments that serve to provide\nsuch a definition for one quantity are subject to particular\nindeterminacies, obeying relations\n (2)\u2013(4)\n which prohibit them from providing a simultaneous definition of two\ncanonically conjugate quantities. Note that in this formulation the\nemphasis has slightly shifted: he now speaks of a limit on the\ndefinition of concepts, i.e., not merely on what we can know,\nbut what we can meaningfully say about a particle. Of course,\nthis stronger formulation follows by application of the above\nmeasurement=meaning principle: if there are, as Heisenberg claims, no\nexperiments that allow a simultaneous precise measurement of two\nconjugate quantities, then these quantities are also not\nsimultaneously well-defined.\n\nHeisenberg\u2019s paper has an interesting \u201cAddition in\nproof\u201d mentioning critical remarks by Bohr, who saw the paper\nonly after it had been sent to the publisher. Among other things, Bohr\npointed out that in the microscope experiment it is not the change of\nthe momentum of the electron that is important, but rather the\ncircumstance that this change cannot be precisely determined in the\nsame experiment. An improved version of the argument,\nresponding to this objection, is given in Heisenberg\u2019s Chicago\nlectures of 1930.\n\nHere (Heisenberg 1930: 16), it is assumed that the electron is\nilluminated by light of wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) and that the scattered\nlight enters a microscope with aperture angle \\(\\varepsilon\\).\nAccording to the laws of classical optics, the accuracy of the\nmicroscope depends on both the wave length and the aperture angle;\nAbbe\u2019s criterium for its \u201cresolving power\u201d, i.e.,\nthe size of the smallest discernable details, gives \n\n\n\\[\\tag{6} \n\\delta q \\sim \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sin \\varepsilon}.\\]\n\n\nOn the other hand, the direction of a scattered photon, when it enters\nthe microscope, is unknown within the angle \\(\\varepsilon\\), rendering\nthe momentum change of the electron uncertain by an amount \n\n\\[\\tag{7} \n\\delta p \\sim \\frac{h \\sin \\varepsilon}{\\lambda}\\]\n\nleading again to the result\n (2).\n\nLet us now analyse Heisenberg\u2019s argument in more detail. Note\nthat, even in this improved version, Heisenberg\u2019s argument is\nincomplete. According to Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cmeasurement=meaning\nprinciple\u201d, one must also specify, in the given context, what\nthe meaning is of the phrase \u201cmomentum of the electron\u201d,\nin order to make sense of the claim that this momentum is changed by\nthe position measurement. A solution to this problem can again be\nfound in the Chicago lectures (Heisenberg 1930: 15). Here, he assumes\nthat initially the momentum of the electron is precisely known, e.g.,\nit has been measured in a previous experiment with an inaccuracy\n\\(\\delta p_{i}\\), which may be arbitrarily small. Then, its position\nis measured with inaccuracy \\(\\delta q\\), and after this, its final\nmomentum is measured with an inaccuracy \\(\\delta p_{f}\\). All three\nmeasurements can be performed with arbitrary precision. Thus, the\nthree quantities \\(\\delta p_{i}, \\delta q\\), and \\(\\delta p_{f}\\) can\nbe made as small as one wishes. If we assume further that the initial\nmomentum has not changed until the position measurement, we can speak\nof a definite momentum until the time of the position measurement.\nMoreover we can give operational meaning to the idea that the momentum\nis changed during the position measurement: the outcome of the second\nmomentum measurement (say \\(p_{f}\\) will generally differ from the\ninitial value \\(p_{i}\\). In fact, one can also show that this change\nis discontinuous, by varying the time between the three\nmeasurements.\n\nLet us try to see, adopting this more elaborate set-up, if we can\ncomplete Heisenberg\u2019s argument. We have now been able to give\nempirical meaning to the \u201cchange of momentum\u201d of the\nelectron, \\(p_{f} - p_{i}\\). Heisenberg\u2019s argument claims that\nthe order of magnitude of this change is at least inversely\nproportional to the inaccuracy of the position measurement:\n\n\n\\[\\tag{8} \\abs{p_{f} - p_{i}} \\delta q \\sim h\\]\n\n\nHowever, can we now draw the conclusion that the momentum is only\nimprecisely defined? Certainly not. Before the position measurement,\nits value was \\(p_{i}\\), after the measurement it is \\(p_{f}\\). One\nmight, perhaps, claim that the value at the very instant of the\nposition measurement is not yet defined, but we could simply settle\nthis by a convention, e.g., we might assign the mean value \\((p_{i} +\np_{f})/2\\) to the momentum at this instant. But then, the momentum is\nprecisely determined at all instants, and Heisenberg\u2019s\nformulation of the uncertainty principle no longer follows. The above\nattempt of completing Heisenberg\u2019s argument thus overshoots its\nmark.\n\nA solution to this problem can again be found in the Chicago Lectures.\nHeisenberg admits that position and momentum can be known exactly. He\nwrites:\n\n\nIf the velocity of the electron is at first known, and the position\nthen exactly measured, the position of the electron for times previous\nto the position measurement may be calculated. For these past times,\n\\(\\delta p\\delta q\\) is smaller than the usual bound. (Heisenberg\n1930: 15)\n\n\nIndeed, Heisenberg says: \u201cthe uncertainty relation does not hold\nfor the past\u201d.\n\nApparently, when Heisenberg refers to the uncertainty or imprecision\nof a quantity, he means that the value of this quantity cannot be\ngiven beforehand. In the sequence of measurements we have\nconsidered above, the uncertainty in the momentum after the\nmeasurement of position has occurred, refers to the idea that the\nvalue of the momentum is not fixed just before the final\nmomentum measurement takes place. Once this measurement is performed,\nand reveals a value \\(p_{f}\\), the uncertainty relation no longer\nholds; these values then belong to the past. Clearly, then, Heisenberg\nis concerned with unpredictability: the point is not that the\nmomentum of a particle changes, due to a position measurement, but\nrather that it changes by an unpredictable amount. It is, however\nalways possible to measure, and hence define, the size of this change\nin a subsequent measurement of the final momentum with arbitrary\nprecision.\n\nAlthough Heisenberg admits that we can consistently attribute values\nof momentum and position to an electron in the past, he sees little\nmerit in such talk. He points out that these values can never be used\nas initial conditions in a prediction about the future behavior of the\nelectron, or subjected to experimental verification. Whether or not we\ngrant them physical reality is, as he puts it, a matter of personal\ntaste. Heisenberg\u2019s own taste is, of course, to deny their\nphysical reality. For example, he writes, \n\n\nI believe that one can formulate the emergence of the classical\n\u201cpath\u201d of a particle succinctly as follows: the\n\u201cpath\u201d comes into being only because we observe it.\n(Heisenberg 1927: 185) \n\n\nApparently, in his view, a measurement does not only serve to give\nmeaning to a quantity, it creates a particular value for this\nquantity. This may be called the \u201cmeasurement=creation\u201d\nprinciple. It is an ontological principle, for it states what is\nphysically real.\n\nThis then leads to the following picture. First we measure the\nmomentum of the electron very accurately. By \u201cmeasurement=\nmeaning\u201d, this entails that the term \u201cthe momentum of the\nparticle\u201d is now well-defined. Moreover, by the\n\u201cmeasurement=creation\u201d principle, we may say that this\nmomentum is physically real. Next, the position is measured with\ninaccuracy \\(\\delta q\\). At this instant, the position of the particle\nbecomes well-defined and, again, one can regard this as a physically\nreal attribute of the particle. However, the momentum has now changed\nby an amount that is unpredictable by an order of magnitude \n\\(\\abs{p_{f} - p_{i}} \\sim h/\\delta q\\). The meaning and validity of\nthis claim can be verified by a subsequent momentum measurement.\n\nThe question is then what status we shall assign to the momentum of\nthe electron just before its final measurement. Is it real? According\nto Heisenberg it is not. Before the final measurement, the best we can\nattribute to the electron is some unsharp, or fuzzy momentum. These\nterms are meant here in an ontological sense, characterizing a real\nattribute of the electron.\n",
