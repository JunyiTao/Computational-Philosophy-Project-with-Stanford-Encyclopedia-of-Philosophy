    "main_text": "\n\nThe question of the nature and plausibility of realism arises with\nrespect to a large number of subject matters, including ethics,\naesthetics, causation, modality, science, mathematics, semantics, and\nthe everyday world of macroscopic material objects and their\nproperties. Although it would be possible to accept (or reject)\nrealism across the board, it is more common for philosophers to be\nselectively realist or non-realist about various topics: thus it would\nbe perfectly possible to be a realist about the everyday world of\nmacroscopic objects and their properties, but a non-realist about\naesthetic and moral value. In addition, it is misleading to think that\nthere is a straightforward and clear-cut choice between being a\nrealist and a non-realist about a particular subject matter. Rather,\none can be more-or-less realist about a particular subject matter.\nAlso, there are many different forms that realism and non-realism can\ntake. \n\nThe question of the nature and plausibility of realism is so\ncontroversial that no brief account of it will satisfy all those with\na stake in the debates between realists and non-realists. This article\noffers a broad brush characterization of realism, and then fills out\nsome of the detail by looking at a few canonical examples of\nopposition to realism. The discussion of forms of opposition to\nrealism is far from exhaustive and is designed only to illustrate a\nfew paradigm examples of the form such opposition can take. Note that\nthe point of this discussion is not to attack realism, but rather to\ngive a sense of the options available for those who wish to oppose\nrealism in a given case, and of the problems faced by those main forms\nof opposition to realism. \n\nThere are two general aspects to realism, illustrated by looking at\nrealism about the everyday world of macroscopic objects and their\nproperties. First, there is a claim about existence. Tables,\nrocks, the moon, and so on, all exist, as do the following facts: the\ntable\u2019s being square, the rock\u2019s being made of granite,\nand the moon\u2019s being spherical and yellow. The second aspect of\nrealism about the everyday world of macroscopic objects and their\nproperties concerns independence. The fact that the moon\nexists and is spherical is independent of anything anyone happens to\nsay or think about the matter. Likewise, although there is a clear\nsense in which the table\u2019s being square is dependent on us (it\nwas designed and constructed by human beings after all), this is not\nthe type of dependence that the realist wishes to deny. The realist\nwishes to claim that apart from the mundane sort of empirical\ndependence of objects and their properties familiar to us from\neveryday life, there is no further (philosophically\ninteresting) sense in which everyday objects and their properties can\nbe said to be dependent on anyone\u2019s linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, or whatever.\n\nIn general, where the distinctive objects of a subject-matter are\na, b, c, \u2026 , and the distinctive\nproperties are F-ness, G-ness, H-ness and\nso on, realism about that subject matter will typically take the form\nof a claim like the following:\n\nGeneric Realism:\n\na, b, and c and so on exist, and the fact\nthat they exist and have properties such as F-ness,\nG-ness, and H-ness is (apart from mundane empirical\ndependencies of the sort sometimes encountered in everyday life)\nindependent of anyone\u2019s beliefs, linguistic practices,\nconceptual schemes, and so on.\n\n\nNon-realism can take many forms, depending on whether or not it is the\nexistence or independence dimension of realism that is questioned or\nrejected. The forms of non-realism can vary dramatically from\nsubject-matter to subject-matter, but error-theories, non-cognitivism,\ninstrumentalism, nominalism,relativism, certain styles of\nreductionism, and eliminativism typically reject realism by rejecting\nthe existence dimension, while idealism, subjectivism, and\nanti-realism typically concede the existence dimension but reject the\nindependence dimension. Philosophers who subscribe to quietism deny\nthat there can be such a thing as substantial metaphysical debate\nbetween realists and their non-realist opponents (because they either\ndeny that there are substantial questions about existence or deny that\nthere are substantial questions about independence).\n",
