    "main_text": "Reputation\n2. Reputation\n\nHazlitt famously described Godwin\u2019s reputation in the 1790s in\nan essay in his Spirit of the Age(1825): \n\n\nNo work gave such a blow to the philosophical mind of the country as\nthe celebrated Enquiry \u2026 Tom Paine was considered for a time as\nTom Fool to him, Paley and old woman, Edmund Burke a flashy sophist.\nTruth, moral truth, it was supposed had here taken up its abode; and\nthese were the oracles of thought. \n\n\nGodwin himself confirms the view. When travelling in the Midlands in\n1794 he found that \n\n\nI was nowhere a stranger. The doctrines of that work, (his Enquiry\nConcerning Political Justice) coincided in a great degree with the\nsentiments then prevailing in English Society, and I was everywhere\nreceived with curiosity and kindness. (Marshall, William\nGodwin, 1984: 121) \n\n\nOnly six years later, reflecting on his reputation, he wrote,\n\nI have fallen (if I have fallen) in one common grave with the cause\nand love of liberty; and in this sense I have been more honoured and\nillustrated in my decline, than ever I was in the highest tide of my\nsuccess. (PPW II, 165)\n\n\nPhilosophically Godwin\u2019s greatest supporters were his\ncontemporaries, such as Thomas Holcroft and John Thelwall, and a\nyounger generation of men (and some literary women) who were attracted\nto Godwin\u2019s intellectual rigour and his radical critique of the\nsocial and political order. Many later abandoned him, Coleridge,\nWordsworth and Southey as part of a rising tide of loyalist reaction,\nShelley and Byron, for more personal and domestic reasons. However,\nhis philosophical anarchism had a profound influence on Robert Owen,\nWilliam Thompson and other utopians in the nineteenth century, and\nthere is also evidence of influence on the Chartist movement and on\npopular labour movements for political reform in the 1840s (see\nMarshall 1984: 390). His impact in literary circles was long lasting,\nboth through his political writings, and through his novels.\nPolitical Justice was read and translated by Benjamin\nConstant in France, and an abridged edition was translated into German\nin 1803, along with the first three of Godwin\u2019s mature novels.\nMarx and Engels knew of his work and cited him as having contributed\nto a theory of exploitation, and as being widely read by the\nproletariat. Later in the nineteenth century Anton Menger and Paul\nEltzbacher introduced Godwin\u2019s work to German audiences, leading\nto further translation. Caleb Williams appeared in Russian in 1838,\nand Chernyshevski, Kroptkin and Tolstoy all read and referred to him.\nIn the late nineteenth century the last book of Political\nJustice, formally titled \u201cOf Property\u201d, but dealing\nwith the prospects for progress in the human race and including his\nattacks on marriage and co-operation, was reprinted as a socialist\ntract, and the whole work was reprinted again in the 1920s. A critical\nedition of the third edition with variants appeared in 1946, and an\nedition of the 1793 text with both later variants and material from\nthe original manuscripts appeared in 1993. Biographies of Godwin have\nalso appeared regularly since the first by C. Kegan-Paul in 1876,\nwhich drew heavily on the extensive manuscript sources. Philosophical\ninterest has been less pronounced, although since the 1940s a slow\ntrickle of books has emerged which have sought to do justice to\nGodwin\u2019s essentially liberal political principles and to his\nmoral philosophy. That work has recognised the importance of thinkers\nof the French Enlightenment, and more recently the Dissenting\ninheritance which his education and early career provided. As a\nresult, the traditional view of Godwin as a strict utilitarian has\nbeen increasingly challenged. Recent work in political philosophy on\nthe appropriate form and scope of impartiality has looked to Godwin,\nmost commonly to define a position to resist, but not exclusively\nso. There has also been an upsurge of interest in Godwin amongst literary scholars and historians studying the romantic period, producing a range of work examining a much wider span of Godwin\u2019s corpus than has hitherto been the case and especially exploring the contribution that his Diary can make to understaning the political culture of London in the period.\n",
