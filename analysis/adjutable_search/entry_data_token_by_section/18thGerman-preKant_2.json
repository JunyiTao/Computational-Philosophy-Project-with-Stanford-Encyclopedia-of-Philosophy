    "main_text": "Radical Philosophy\n2. Radical Philosophy\n\nThrough the efforts of Thomasius, and later Christian Wolff, the\nFriedrichs-Universit\u00e4t in Halle became the intellectual centre of\nthe early Enlightenment in Germany. And despite, for instance,\nThomasius\u2019 conflict with Orthodox Lutheranism in Leipzig, and\nWolff\u2019s controversy with his Pietist colleagues\n (\u00a73.3,\n below), neither were explicitly hostile towards religious belief, the\nChurch, or to (appropriately exercised) religious authority; nor for\nthat matter did either seek to challenge the existing political order.\nBeyond the German academy, however, a more radical philosophical\ntradition flourished, one that drew on the thought of, among others,\nHobbes, Gassendi, and Spinoza, and proliferated through the\ntransmission of clandestine literature within networks that spanned\nacross Europe. While there was considerable diversity among the views\nheld by the thinkers within this radical philosophical tradition, they\ntended to be highly critical of organized religion (if not necessarily\nprofessed atheists) and of the established political order, rejected\nthe authority of the Bible as a source of revealed truth, and defended\na (not always sophisticated) materialistic conception of the soul (cf.\nStiehler 1966; Israel 2001: 628\u2013636; Mulsow 2006 [2015]). It\nbears noting that while this tradition flourished outside of a narrow\nacademic context, there was nonetheless considerable exchange and\nmutual influence between figures in both the mainstream and radical\ntraditions.\n\nAmong the most important German thinkers within this radical\nphilosophical tradition, and quite representative of its intellectual\ndiversity, are Friedrich Wilhelm Stosch (1648\u20131704) and Theodor\nLudwig Lau (1670\u20131740). Stosch was the son of a Reformed\nminister and court chaplain in Brandenburg and worked as a court\nsecretary until ill-health forced him to resign in 1686. Stosch\nsubsequently pursued philosophical interests and in 1692 published his\nsole known text, the Concordia rationis et fidei (Concord\nof Reason and Faith). In spite of its title, the Concord\nseeks to subordinate the claims of faith to the canons of reason, in\naccordance with a broadly Socinian outlook, and Stosch denies that\nthere is any basis in reason for conviction in the natural immortality\nof the soul (for which he also provides a materialist account), and\nrejects the reasonableness of eternal damnation. Stosch\u2019s\nConcord was published anonymously (with Amsterdam listed as\nthe place of publication) with only 100 copies printed, but when these\nwere discovered for sale, they were seized and burned. Stosch was\nforced to identify himself as the author, was arrested, and\nsubsequently investigated by a committee consisting of, among others,\nPufendorf, concluding with Stosch\u2019s public retraction of the\nbook in 1694.\n\nLau had studied law in his home town of K\u00f6nigsberg before moving\nto Halle in 1694 where he attended lectures by Thomasius. In 1695, he\nembarked on a trip through Europe and England (where he apparently met\nNewton), taking up a position as councillor with the young Duke of\nCourland on his return. The early death of his patron saw Lau turn to\nintellectual pursuits, and in 1717 he published a number of treatises\non various subjects, including the anonymous Meditationes\nphilosophicae de Deo, mundo et homine (Philosophical\nMeditations concerning God, the World, and the Human Being). The\ntext covers a wide range of philosophical (and medical and political)\ntopics, and is distinctive in its eclectic borrowings from Spinoza,\nLocke, Plotinus, and Giordano Bruno, among others. Its general\nphilosophical outlook might most accurately be characterized as\npantheistic, both in the Spinozistic sense inasmuch as Lau defends the\nworld\u2019s pre-existence in God and denies its creation ex\nnihilo (although the extent of Lau\u2019s Spinozism is disputed;\ncf. Schr\u00f6der 1987: 128\u2013132), but also and especially in the\nsense of the Irish freethinker John Toland\u2019s pantheism inasmuch\nas Lau attempts to outline the foundations of a universal religion.\nDue to its strident denunciation of the clergy and a genealogical\ncritique of the current political order, the Meditations was\ninstantly controversial, and Lau\u2019s publisher was eventually\npressured into revealing Lau\u2019s authorship. This led to\nLau\u2019s imprisonment, during which he attempted suicide, and his\nsubsequent expulsion from Frankfurt am Main; Lau\u2019s appeal to his\nmentor, Thomasius, for a review of the proceedings was also met with a\npainful denunciation. Lau attempted to return to his study of the law,\nbut his unorthodox opinions and previous brush with infamy made this\nimpossible (in spite of a formal recantation of his earlier views). He\ndied, in poor mental health, in Altona in 1740.\n",
