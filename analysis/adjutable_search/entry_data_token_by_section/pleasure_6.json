He observed\nthat simple personal-report level motivational accounts fail because\nwe may experience pleasure without any previously felt distress,\ndesire, or noticed need, as sometimes when looking, listening,\nsmelling, or learning, and also that one may fulfill physiological\nneeds without experiencing pleasure in the process of so doing\n(Philebus 51A\u201352C). He therefore refined and\ngeneralized the current physiologically-influenced account of pleasure\nas restoration of bodily imbalance or deficiency, on the model of\nhunger and thirst, to make it instead the sensation, perception, or\nconsciousness (all aisth\u0113sis in Greek) of return from a\n(possibly unnoticed) state of deficiency to a naturally healthy\n state.[13]\n The \u2018pure\u2019 (\u2018unmixed with pain\u2019) pleasures of\nknowing and perceiving were apparently construed as signaling the\nsatisfaction of needs we are unaware of, and so not pained by,\nacquiring or having. A unified account of all pleasure was thus\nachieved, as awareness of processes of fulfilling very diverse\nneeds, systematically accounting for both pleasure\u2019s unity\nand diversity. Pleasure could be accorded a place in the best life\nattainable for beings like ourselves, imperfect enough to have\nrecurrent needs but sometimes aware of their however partial and\ntemporary satisfaction. But the absolutely best life would be a divine\none of permanent perfect knowing without the possibility of further\nlearning or any other improvement, and in which there would therefore\nbe no pleasure at all\u00a0\u2013 and presumably we would do well,\ninsofar as we are able, to approximate to this (Philebus\n33B). Descartes\u2019 views of the function or content of pleasure\nand Spinoza\u2019s official definitions of pleasure as an affect of\ntransition to greater perfection are close to Plato\u2019s, as also\nare one of Kant\u2019s\n characterizations,[14]\n one of Elijah Millgram\u2019s (2000, pp.\u00a0122\u201326), and\nTimothy Schroeder\u2019s (2001, 2004, discussed in \u00a73.1). Such\nImprovement Indicator Views may account for diversity within\npleasure by the different species of improvements indicated. But they\nneed not attribute explicit awareness of needs or of their\nfulfillments as such to the experiencing subject. A modern\nversion might attribute only biological functions, without requiring\nany explicit representation of departures from or\nrestorations to one\u2019s natural state at either personal or\nsubpersonal levels.\n2.2.2 Aristotle: Perfecting Different Activities\n\nAristotle rejected Plato\u2019s assimilation of enjoying sights,\nsounds, smells, and intellectual activity to the satisfaction of\nhomeostasis-serving appetites and also his view of the best, divine,\nchangeless life we should aspire to approximate to as one of\npleasureless cognition. Yet he adopted as his own the project of\nfinding a unitary account of pleasure that would fit the\nteleological metaphysics and intellectualist value theory he inherited\nfrom Plato\u00a0\u2013 and also Plato\u2019s strategy of giving a generic\nformal account that allows for specific variation. He thus rejected\nPlato\u2019s restoration process account totally to substitute his\nown equally general account of pleasure as arising rather from the\nactivities of animals, or of their parts or faculties, when these are\nalready, at least in part, in good condition.\n\nAristotle\u2019s account of life as a teleologically and\nhierarchically unified system of biological capacities allowed him to\ngive a unified account of pleasure while discriminating systematically\namong different kinds and instances according to their ranks in his\nvalue-laden hierarchy of life capacities and their functionings. Each\nactivity, when unimpeded and perfected, on his view, gives rise to its\nown specific \u2018supervenient\u2019 (arising from a preexisting\nground) pleasure, differentiated in kind from those belonging to other\nkinds of activity (NE X, 5). The different pleasures thus\nhave a generic unity, as belonging to perfected activities of\ndeveloped life capacities\u00a0\u2013 a unity ultimately deriving\nfrom the generic unity of life itself. The differing causal powers of\ndifferent kinds of pleasure, each supporting engagement in its own\nspecific activity, but interfering with others, could thus be\naccounted for, and their higher-level functional and felt similarity\nas well, by regarding instances of pleasure as experiences of the\nsuccess of one\u2019s life\u2019s, or soul\u2019s, fulfillment in\nparticular activities of its constitutive perfected\nactivity\u00a0\u2013 but in different activities that, according to\nthe differing teleological ranks of their life capacities and objects,\nhave correspondingly differing degrees of pleasure and value. Pleasure\nis thus no accidental addition to life; it naturally reflects and\ntracks success in living and its value. This value is teleologically\nexplanatory of our biological development and of the lower animal\ndesires in which we share, but also gives to human life and rational\nhuman action their own characteristic higher ultimate goal and point.\nLiving a life that brings its biologically highest constitutive\ncapacities to their complete development and then exercises them\nwithout impediment upon their naturally best and most suitable objects\nis success in life and brings the most pleasant pleasure with it.\nTrivial or ignoble pleasures are sought instead by those who are\nstunted in their capacities for higher activities, having failed to\ndevelop the intellectual and moral virtues needed to use these well,\nand consequently fall short of the highest natural human fulfillment\nand goal. That is the fully human happiness which consists in using\nreason well, which at its best approximates to the best and\npleasantest life form of all, the changeless purely intellectual\nactivity of God. Our pleasure tracks the perfection of our current\nactivities and thus our proximity to this, life at its cognitively\nclearest, most awake, and best (Protrepticus B87\u2013B91,\n1984, p.\u00a02414; Nicomachean Ethics VII, 11\u201314 and\nX, 1\u20136).\n\nAristotle\u2019s theory, which we may call a Perfection in\nFunctioning View, accommodates both pleasure\u2019s generic\nunity and specific diversity by making pleasure and its value vary\ntogether, with the varying nature and value of animals\u2019 various\nlife activities, and these, in turn, with those of their objects or\nends. It has had a deservedly great influence on later accounts, from\nlater antiquity to recent philosophy and welfare\n economics.[15]\n Recently the prolific social psychologist Mihaly\nCsikszentmihalyi\u2019s studies mainly of self-reports of the\n\u2018flow experience\u2019 of engaged absorption in activities have\nprovided some empirical support for flow\u2019s connection with\nenjoyment, but also, perhaps, for its not, despite its advertising,\nbeing the very same thing\u00a0\u2013 as he, like Aristotle, in his\nimproving exhortation, sometimes seems to want it to\n be.[16]\n\nJohn Stuart Mill followed Aristotle in endorsing a rational preference\nfor \u2018higher\u2019 pleasures over those we share with\n\u2018lower\u2019 animals, but objected to Aristotle\u2019s tying\npleasure to objective functional standards. He and more recent writers\nhave posed simple counterexamples to these being even sufficient or\nnecessary conditions for pleasure, using perceptual examples such as\nAristotle used in expounding his theory. Mill\u2019s objection may be\ninterpreted and expanded upon as follows. Aristotle\u2019s theory\nimplies that, other things equal, the more precise and informative of\ntwo perceptions or cognitions must be the more pleasant. But this, it\nseems, may be the worse of two bad smells. The excellent acuity of the\nolfactory system and even its unimpeded operation and the mutual\nsuitability of faculty and object (NE X,\n4:1174b14\u20131175a3) seem not to exclude this. So Aristotle\u2019s\nconditions seems insufficient for pleasure, if excellence of object is\nfilled out in cognitive or functional rather than in hedonic terms.\n(Neither is any such condition necessary for pleasure, as in a relaxed\nand lazy mood.) Of course, we might downgrade or upgrade sensory\ninteractions ad hoc, counting those we enjoy as excellent, but then we\nmove in a small circle and offer no independent characterization of\n pleasure.[17]\n Perhaps a quasi-neoAristotelian might acknowledge all this and\nabandon the claims that led to the falsified predictions, while still\nbelieving pleasure is some way activities are performed (to\nbe filled out empirically). But whether any plausible way can be found\nremains to be shown. The same holds all the more for Aristotle\u2019s\nambition of explaining pleasure\u2019s value by some more basic\nindependently defined value in biological functioning.\n2.2.3 Epicurus: Savoring the Activity of Life\u2019s Natural State\n\nEpicurus took a less elitist and less intellectualist view of pleasure\naccording to which it is available to its greatest extent to any\nanimal free from bodily and emotional pain (Cooper 1999a), with no\nhighly developed distinctively human capacity or functioning in\nprinciple required. Epicureans cultivated philosophy, however, to free\npeople from groundless fears of afterlife suffering and death, and\ninculcated habits of living enabling one to live simply and thus\nsecurely because not needing, and thus not fearing loss of, luxuries.\nVarying pleasant activities was also recommended, perhaps because this\nis needed to maintain requisite awareness of our stable natural\nstate\u2019s unimpeded life activity by varying its expression (cp.\nGosling and Taylor, 1982, 374 and Erler and Schofield, 1999, 653 and\nfurther references cited there; for further references supporting a\nvariety of interpretations see n. 30 below). While emphasizing his\ndifferences with Epicurus, as he interpreted him (1790/1976,\n294\u2013300, 307), Adam Smith rather similarly believed that someone\n\u201cwho is in health, who is out of debt, and has a clear\nconscience\u201d is in \u201cthe natural and ordinary state of\nmankind\u201d to the widespread happiness typical of which nothing\nimportant can be added (45). \n2.3 A Kind of Directedness toward Objects or Contents?\n\nMany ordinary mental states recognized by common sense, such as\nparticular beliefs and desires, are essentially directed upon their\nobject or content. Could pleasure\u2019s unity be that of such a\nkind, and its diversity derive from from that of its intentional\ncontents or objects? If not always of Aristotelian activities we\nenjoy. or real people or things, perhaps prospects or propositions or\nimpossibilities that are abstracta or have their being as objects of\nthought alone? According to a Christian philosophical tradition,\npleasure constitutively depends on a mental act of willing or loving\nthat may be directed toward different cognitively presented things.\nAnd according to the contemporary analytic philosopher Fred Feldman,\npleasure itself is a single propositional attitude, like belief, that,\nsimilarly, may be directed toward diverse propositional contents. The\ntenability of such accounts concerns not only philosophers primarily\ninterested in pleasure but also those more generally concerned with\nthe nature of mind. Brentano claimed that all mentality is intentional\nand some recent analytic philosophers that the phenomenal character of\nexperience is constituted by its representational content (e.g., Lycan\n2005). If there are representationally contentless but phenomenally\nconscious pleasant moods, such claims and theories cannot be\ncorrect.\n2.3.1 Liking, Loving, Savoring\n\nThe lack of a precise account of pleasure\u2019s nature presented no\nscandal so long as pleasure was thought of as an experience, however\nvariable and generic, typical causes of which might be roughly\ncharacterized but for which no verbally explicit real definition was\nto be expected (Locke and Kant, cited in n.\u00a02; Mill 1872/1979,\np.\u00a0430). Perhaps this is all an account short on biological or\ncomputational detail, and on the deep functional insight these might\noffer, can provide. However, taking introspection to be a source of\nscientific knowledge led to disquiet when introspectors failed to\nagree about what, if any, distinctive introspectible item they had\nfound in experiencing pleasure. Even before this method had run its\ncourse in psychology (see n. 3 above), the philosopher Henry Sidgwick\nhad failed to find any distinctive uniform quality in his own\nexperience of pleasure. His normative account of pleasure, as\n\u201cfeeling, apprehended as desirable by the sentient individual at\nthe time of feeling it\u201d (1907, p.\u00a0129; see n.\u00a05,\n\u00b64 above), led C.D. Broad to suggest, in passing, that the\npleasant experiences might be just those we\n like.[18]\n Ambiguity in academic use of this colloquial language of\n\u201cliking\u201d has led to equivocation in the literature. Some\nauthors use it for an intrinsically hedonic state distinguished from\nwanting or desiring but not from pleasure. Others use it instead for\nan attitude (such as desire) they suppose either to constitute from\nwithin, or else to pick out and thus unify from outside, experiences\nof pleasure as such and sometimes to insist wrongly that their\nopponents, by using the same language, have conceded their view.\n(Problems with such language were flagged by Zink 1962, 90\u20132;\nTrigg 1970, 52\u20133, 116\u201319; Katz 2008, 414\u201317; Tanyi\n2010; and Labukt 2012, 158 but still afflict the ethics literature.\nThis issue is also often run together with that of whether the related\nreasons are value- or desire-based, but distinguished from it by\nHeathwood 2011.)\n\nFranz Brentano, Sidgwick\u2019s close contemporary, brought explicit\nconcern with such intentional (act/object or attitude/content)\nstructure to the attention of Western philosophers outside the\ncontinuing Catholic intellectual tradition. The involvement of\npleasure and emotions with beliefs and desires had been a starting\npoint for discussions in Plato (Philebus 36ff.) and Aristotle\n(Rhetoric II, 2\u201311). In the following tradition\npleasure was often regarded as, in part, a bodily phenomenon not\nbelonging to our true, nonbodily, self or true\n good.[19]\n Scholastic philosophers of the Western Christian high middle ages\naccordingly regarded bodily pleasure as occurring in a sensory soul or\npower, caused directly by sensory awareness. They debated competing\nviews concerning the causation and intentionality of thought-mediated\npleasure, regarded as occurring in the intellectual soul or power. On\nWilliam of Ockham\u2019s account, such pleasure causally depends\ndirectly on the will\u2019s loving acceptance, as good in itself, of\nan object intellectually presented. For Ockham, this pleasure is\ndistinct from the loving acceptance on which it depends, as is shown\nby the example (used similarly earlier by John Duns Scotus) of a\ncognitively pleased scholar in a depressed mood, in which the normally\nresulting pleasure fails to occur. Others denied these two were\ndistinct. Some of them allowed, however, a distinct second-order\nloving taking the original loving as its object and thus as that of\nits pleasure; another thought this higher-order loving and pleasure\nmight be included in the original act of\n loving.[20]\n Descartes rejected this dualism, regarding all\npleasure (as all else mental) as essentially thought (and,\nspecifically, as at least often involving thinking that some good\npertains to oneself) and sensory, or bodily, pleasure as pleasing the\nimmaterial thinking mind by informing it of its body\u2019s\nsufficiency to withstand the mild challenge to its integrity that the\nsensory stimulation presents (see n.\u00a02, \u00b62, for references).\nFor Brentano, sensory pleasure takes as its intentional content,\nrather, the sensuous experiencing of sensory qualities. It is a loving\ndirected toward a sensory act. In intellectually-caused pleasure, our\npurely spiritual (nonbodily) loving (as it seems:\nnonaffective liking, approving of, or being pleased by) the\ncontent of a thought causes us to affectively love a sensory\nexperiencing\u00a0\u2013 i.e., to experience bodily sensory\n pleasure.[21]\n Brentano seems in these views to have followed his medieval\nScholastic models, without taking on board the standard modern notion\nof affective consciousness that is neither conative nor sensory nor\ncoldly intellectual (Kant 1790/2000 and its Bibliography note).\n\nCaution is required when appropriating the medieval language of\nintentionality in contemporary non-Scholastic use. In the older\ndeployments considered above, in the context of an Aristotelian\nteleological metaphysics of mind and nature in which minds and natural\nforms were made for each other and their moving toward perfected acts\nof knowing did explanatory work, naive realism about content\nascriptions had a fundamental place. In contemporary cognitive\nsciences and analytic philosophy, they are sometimes understood more\ninstrumentally than as expressing precise ground-level\n truths.[22]\n It\u2019s often not clear what ascribing a content or object to,\nsay, pleasure involves. There\u2019s also no standard single use of\nattitude language in academic Philosophy. Uses predominant in the\nanalytic philosophy of language and thereby in the philosophy of mind\nusually involve relations to propositions, about which there is much\nliterature but no standard account of what they are or what ascribing\nrelations to them involves. Belief is standard example. A different or\nnarrower use more influenced by psychology and common in ethics\ninvolves being motivationally, affectively, or evaluatively (rather\nthan cognitively) for or against (e.g., Nowell-Smith 1954,\n111\u2013115, the source of the term \u201cpro-attitude\u201d and\nof classifying pleasure as one of these).\n2.3.2 A Content-Involving Attitude, Like Belief?\n\nFred Feldman identifies pleasure (in the relevant inclusive use) with\nan occurrent propositional attitude comparable to Brentano\u2019s\n loving.[23]\nIf an act/object analysis applies uniformly to\nall pleasure, and if we must then choose\nbetween the objects and how we take them, then\nopting thus, for how we take them, would seem the correct\nchoice. Accordingly, on Feldman\u2019s view, the act or attitude\ntype, rather than its diverse objects or contents, would be what all\nepisodes of pleasure have in common and makes them such, while its\nobjects, including instances of \u2018sensory pleasure\u2019 (in use\n2 of n.\u00a01, \u00b68), are brought together and unified only by way\nof their relation to it, so that this attitude is, in the important\nsense, what pleasure is (cf. Feldman 1997a, 2004).\n\nUnlike Brentano, for whom even human intellectual pleasure turns out,\nin the end, to be sensory, bodily, and affective, Feldman, in\nattempting a similarly unifying account, moves in the opposite\ndirection; his attitudinal pleasure is not supposed ever to\nessentially involve as such any feeling at all. (For this reason, his\nsaying it is an attitude like belief communicates his intention more\nclearly than his going on sometimes to add hope and fear, without\nmaking explicit that he intends these latter, also, to be pure\npropositional attitudes not essentially or centrally involving\nfeeling, as he perhaps, like the Stoics, does.) Friends of the simple\npicture\u2019s experiential core, of pleasure conceived as involving\nfelt momentary affective experience, will want to resist this denial\nof the centrality of feeling in pleasure. But there are also other\ngrounds for skepticism about the uniform attitude approach, since an\nact/object or attitude/content account, again, seems not to fit the\nphenomenology of someone enjoying a pleasant nap, daydream, or diffuse\ngood mood, as it must if it is to be an account of inclusive\npleasure\u00a0\u2013 as must be intended given Feldman\u2019s larger\naim of formulating hedonism as a view of \u2018the good life\u2019\nin ethical theory. Taking all pleasure to be a single special kind of\npropositional or de se (directly attributing a property to\noneself) attitude, as in Feldman 1997c/1988, in all human and animal\npleasure alike, also strains intuitive plausibility by requiring\ncognitive powers of propositional representation or self-reference\neven in young children and animals (as in Feldman 2002, p.\u00a0607),\nif these are not to be denied pleasure. And the belief we must choose\nbetween pleasure feeling like something and its having intentionality\nalso seems questionable. Bennett Helm, as we have seen (\u00a71.2),\nand also other contemporary philosophers, including Geoffrey Madell\n(2002, chs. 5 and 6) and Timothy Schroeder (\u00a73.1), reject this\nexclusive disjunction of the two in proposing accounts on which both\nbelong to pleasure, as did many medievals and, following them,\nBrentano.\n\nThe single uniform attitude approach also faces a problematic tension\nbetween its intuitive motivation and its technical adequacy. The\nnatural and intuitive assignment of contents that makes plausible\nconstruing pleasure sometimes as an attitude with\npropositional content runs into problems when it is extended to a\nuniform propositional attitude theory of all pleasure, as Anscombe\n(1981c/1967) first observed. To use and develop further her line of\nreasoning using her original example: her enjoying riding with someone\nis different and separable from her enjoying reflecting then on the\nfact that she is (and, if the latter is distinct from that, also from\nher being pleased then that this is the case). But on a single uniform\nattitude analysis, applied in what seems the natural and intuitive\nway, it seems these should consist in her directing the same attitude\non the same proposition (or, alternatively, on her self-attributing\nthe same property). But this doesn\u2019t seem to allow that she\nmight enjoy one but not the other, as she surely may. A technical\nproblem may have a technical fix. Perhaps one may thus regard the\nactivity of reflecting as a different mode of presentation (or the\nlike) of the same propositional content that Anscombe more directly\nenjoys to the same attitude, while retaining something of the\napproach\u2019s intuitive motivation. However, it seems more natural\nand intuitive to say the attitude is directed, instead, primarily\ntoward these different activities, including some naturally described\nas themselves taking propositional or de se\n(property-self-attributing) contents, such as Anscombe\u2018s\nreflecting that she is riding with someone, but also to\nothers that don\u2019t, such as her just riding.\n\nAnscombe\u2019s earlier work, apparently provoked by proposals\nsimilar to Feldman\u2019s, suggests such a way out. As she noted,\ncases described as enjoying a proposition or fact seem to involve our\nthinking about it or being in some state or the like (1981c/1967).\nThese seem to be activities or experiencings that we may (following\nAristotle) regard as activities, at least for present purposes. We\nmay, then, let the different activities make the needed distinctions,\nby saying that enjoying riding is one thing and enjoying reflecting\nthat one is riding is another. Such an approach also handles the\npleasure of prancing puppies and of suckling babies without seeming to\nascribe to them the general and logically combinatorial\nrepresentational capacities that may be involved in having attitudes\ntoward propositions, attributing properties to oneself, or the\nlike\u00a0\u2013 capacities that puppies and babies may lack and that\neven human adults may not always exercise when enjoying a nap or a\nwarm bath. The most natural and uniform attitudinal view of pleasure\nwould thus seem to be not Feldman\u2019s propositional view but\nrather one on which to enjoy a sensation is just to enjoy sensing it\nand that similarly to enjoy any cognitive content or object of thought\nas such is just to enjoy thinking about it or the like\u00a0\u2013\nand that these are all actual activities. But this seems at least very\nclose to an \u2018adverbial\u2019 (activity-dependent)\nneoAristotelian view on which particular instances of pleasure are\nmodes of their activities (without the need for any special single\nkind of attitude). \n\nFeldman, in an encyclopedia treatment that perhaps presents the\nattitudinal approach to pleasure more broadly than the works cited\nabove presenting his own propositional version, allows attitudinal\npleasure to take among its objects or contents activities and\nsensations as well as facts (2001, p.\u00a0667). Elsewhere he allows\nnonactual states of affairs among the objects of attitudinal\npropositional pleasure (2002, p.\u00a0608). Presumably he will need\ndistinct impossible propositions, so that Hobbes\u2019 pleasure in\ncontemplating the (supposed) geometrical fact (actually, a\nmathematical impossibility) that the circle can be squared may be\ndistinguished from his pleasure in his having (equally impossibly)\ndiscovered this. (Surely the magnitude of his taking pleasure in these\ntwo may change in opposite directions, as his focus shifts, as he\nfirst loses all thought of himself in the mathematics, but later\nswells with self-regarding pride.) Whether there are such distinct\nimpossible states of affairs or propositions (between which Feldman\nmay not distinguish) seems especially controversial. Feldman tells us\nthat pleasure is an attitude like belief, so it may seem we may rest\ncontent to have pleasure no worse off than belief and leave it to\ntheorists of belief to solve such shared problems generally. But\npleasure must be even more general than belief if, as in Feldman 2001,\nit takes as its objects not only the contents of belief (often thought\nof as abstract entities, which as we have seen need to at least\nrepresent, if not include, nonactual and even impossible objects) but\nalso sensations and activities that, for us to enjoy them, must be not\nonly actual and concrete but also present\nand our own. The supposedly single attitude of pleasure thus\nseems to come apart along this line, in part corresponding to one\nbetween sensory and intellectual pleasure that many medievals and\nBrentano respected, by complicating their theories at this point, as\nFeldman does not. The move from Locke\u2019s distinctive feeling of\npleasure to Feldman\u2019s stipulated distinctive attitude does not\nobviously help with the unity problem for pleasure that he supposes it\nto solve; similar doubts arise about pleasure\u2019s unity and, it\nseems, more besides.\n\nFurther, pleasure differs from belief and similar nonaffective\npropositional attitudes in seeming to be more locally biological and\nless broadly functional. It often seems to spill over promiscuously\nfrom one object to another as belief logically cannot; it is generally\nsuppressed by depressed mood, as belief in general is not; a\ndiminished capacity for pleasure may be restored by antidepressant\ndrugs and other therapies, while there are neither specific deficits\naffecting all and only beliefs (but not other attitudes taking a\nsimilar range of contents) nor specific remedies for them. Belief and\nthe like are thus plausibly thought of, at least in large part, as\nbroadly functional states neither simply localized in any single\ndiscrete neural system nor susceptible to being capable of being\nsimilarly caused directly by similar chemical interventions in all\nphysiologically similar individuals. If psychological realism and\nparsimony are to constrain our theory, the evidence would seem to\nfavor an account more like Ockham\u2019s on which objects presented\nby thought may be loved consequently, with pleasure\noften resulting. We may thus more plausibly theorize that\nsophisticated intentionality belongs primarily to the cognitively\nrepresentational powers of mind, also to the loving that uses these in\nreferring to and acting toward its objects, but is ascribed to\npleasure only derivatively through functionally appropriate causal\nconnections by way of these and the like. Then we can distinguish\nHobbes\u2019 two pleasures in thinking of different impossibilities\nand also Anscombe\u2019s in riding and reflecting on it derivatively,\nby way of the differences in the relevant activities, whatever view we\ntake about thinking and its contents.\n2.3.3 Welcoming-Whatever-Comes that May Float Free?\n\nOn the other hand, if something in the spirit of Feldman\u2019s\nwelcoming attitude were freed from the requirement of always taking a\ncontent or object, and might obtain on its own, then it could capture\nnot only all of the above but also cases in which we seem to have\npleasure when doing nothing at all and attitudinizing toward nothing\nat all. Perhaps, then, pleasure is a stance (for lack of a\nbetter place-holding term) of affective openness, welcoming, or\nimmediate liking with which we may wholeheartedly engage in the\nactivities and experiences we enjoy, from thinking to swimming to just\nlying about and \u2018doing nothing\u2019, but that may also (unlike\nordinary propositional attitudes or de se\n[reflexively-centered] attitudes) obtain without having any object or\ncontent at all. Like many experiential features and mental processes,\nit might be sometimes integrated and bound with others, but sometimes\nnot, and the same episodic instance might survive as the variable\nbinding and integration develops, decays, and shifts over time\n(perhaps varying without increasing the pleasure, as the Epicureans\nsaid) while the underlying mood or stance of readiness for pleasant\nengagement remains, rather than being individuated in term of its\ncontents or objects as particular intentional mental acts are. Rather\nthan being an attitude of taking pleasure in some specific or\nparticular content or other, pleasure itself could be a central state\nindependent of such attitudes from which they arise and perhaps\ninclude as their common inner ground.\n\nEmpirical evidence that affect can exist separated from what under\nnormal conditions would have been its object supports thinking of it\nin such less object-bound ways. In experiments the nonconscious\nmechanisms that bind pleasure to objects can be fooled about the\npleasure\u2019s source (which presumably they evolved to track),\nresulting in personal-level ignorance or error about this and even the\nunconscious formation of arbitrary new preferences through\nexperimental manipulations. For example, experimental subjects may be\ncaused to like a beverage better by initial exposure to it after a\nphotograph of a smiling face under conditions in which there is no\nawareness of the face being seen or of the affective response it\ncaused. This presumably works by pleasantness being\n\u2018misattributed\u2019 by unconscious cognitive mechanisms that,\nignorant of any more appropriate cause for the positive affect,\nattribute pleasantness to the next salient stimulus they find, with an\nenduring liking for the beverage resulting from this. Similar\nspillover of affect from unattended sources, for example, of\nunattended physical discomfort leading to anger at a salient target,\nseems common in everyday life. Such phenomenona are all presumably\nexplained by affective processes being detachable from what would have\nbeen their objects under more cognitively optimal\n conditions.[24]\n\nOn the basis of this and other science (e.g., Shizgal 1997, 1999) it\nseems that affect, may, like color and many other features, be\nprocessed separately in the brain from representations of any objects\nto which the feature in question (e.g., color or pleasantness) really\nbelongs or is later assigned. Such assignment presumably requires\nactive binding to object representations, however fused with these in\nour experience of liking or hope our affect may often seem. Cases of\nobjectless \u2018diffuse\u2019 mood in which, rather than the\nbinding of affect being displaced to an object that did not cause it,\nthe affect rather remains objectless and unbound (if only for lack of\na suitable cognitively accessible object), seem clear and common\nenough not only in unusual experiences but also in everyday dreamy\nlife to establish object-independence at the personal level, even if\nthe experimental evidence for misplaced affect is rejected. That\npositive affect is often diffuse (objectless) seems uncontroversial in\nthe psychology of mood (Watson 2000; Thayer 1989, 1996). That pleasure\nis in itself objectless is sometimes supposed in theorizing in\nbehavioral neuroscience, as well (e.g., Robinson and Berridge, 1993,\npp. 261ff.). The same assumption is the basis for the psychologist and\nemotion specialist James Russell\u2019s notion of core affect, which\nplaces an in-itself objectless feeling good at the ground level of the\nconstruction of more complex positive emotion (Russell 2003).\n\nWe may call all views sharing the general approach on which pleasure\nis either a welcoming attitude (with instances individuated, in part,\nby their contents or objects) or a potentially freestanding welcoming\nstance, Welcoming Views\u00a0\u2013 and only those latter, on which\nit is such a stance that can float free, Welcoming-Whatever-Comes\n Views.[25]\n The latter capture something of the connections biologists and\npsychologists have made with approach behavior, and past philosophers\nand common sense with desire, while still allowing pleasure to be\nsometimes a freestanding welcoming mood and nonintentional, but with\nthe potential for becoming bound to representational states and\npresenting objects as good then. Such a stance could be unified and\nrecognized in part by way of an experiential core.\n2.3.4 Intentionality, Subjectivity, and Consciousness\n\nBrentano influentially claimed that all mental phenomena\nexhibit intentionality as their distinctive mark (Jacob 2014). (The\nancient roots of the philosophical concepts of mind and consciousness\non which Brentano drew were cognitive.) Contemporary philosophers\nseeking a unified account of all phenomena covered by the inclusive\nmodern Western notion of mind often follow Brentano in hoping to do\nthis in representational terms and to account in this way for\nconsciousness. In this they may turn for support and guidance to\nneuroscientific accounts of the remapping of information from\nperipheral receptors to the brain and from one brain region to\nanother. Thus Michael Tye, in discussing mood, appeals to Antonio\nDamasio\u2019s account of feelings as representing conditions of the\nbody (Damasio 1994, 1999, 2003; Tye 1995, pp.\u00a0128\u201330; Craig\n2002, 2009, 2015).\n\nIntentional structure has also been motivated by a subject/object\nduality that may seem metaphysically necessary or even given in\nsubjective awareness itself. Pleasure has often been thought of as\nimmediately, essentially, and even wholly conscious in itself.\nHowever, some philosophers have distinguished pleasure from\nconsciousness of pleasure. And this may introduce a layer of\nintentional structure otherwise not found in pleasure itself. Seventh\ncentury India saw Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015besika criticisms of the\nviews of some self-denying Buddhists that all awareness, and therefore\nall pleasure, is self-disclosing, without any need for a higher-order\ncognitive act of an ulterior self. And G. E. Moore, following Plato,\nargued that we must decide whether pleasure or cognitive awareness\n(or, as Moore put it, \u201cconsciousness of pleasure\u201d) is the\nlocus of hedonic value and that this is properly located in the\nconsciousness of pleasure rather than in bare pleasure\n itself.[26]\n Perhaps our concept of consciousness comes apart at this juncture and\npleasure may be immediately or \u2018phenomenally\u2019 experienced\nwhile unnoticed and without its being generally cognitively\naccessible. Someone sympathetic to the simple picture who applies this\ndistinction of Block\u2019s (Block 1995, 1997, 2002; Katz 2005b; cp.\nHaybron 2007) might locate hedonic value in bare pleasure, rather than\nin any cognitive awareness of it. Then we might mediate between the\nBuddhists and their opponents by allowing nondual phenomenal\nexperience without insisting that it need be cognitively\nself-disclosing and respond to Moore by saying that hedonic\nexperience, even when unmonitored, may be phenomenally conscious and\nvaluable nonetheless. And indeed scientists increasingly regard\npleasure, like many cognitive states and processes, as separable from\n awareness.[27]\n\n3. Pleasure, Motivation, and the Brain\n\nThe simple picture of pleasure as valuable and attractive due to its\nown experiential nature may survive the objections considered so far,\nat least as theoretical possibility. However, looking more closely at\nour experience of pleasure, its long-noted but variable connections to\nmotivation, and at the sciences studying these raises further\nquestions. Pleasure itself, or at least pleasure and forms of\nmotivation with which it is typically integrated and easily confused,\nmay come apart, on closer analysis. The search for true pleasure that\nis really as good as it seems, beyond taint of compulsive craving or\nbiological illusion, now continues in the studies of the brain. These\ngive us reason to think that, if there is some single experience of\ntrue pleasure, its relations to motivation may be more heterogeneous,\ncomplex, and contingent than naive versions of the simple picture,\nhedonism, and common sense supposed. But perhaps the deeper\nphilosophers and yogis knew this all along.\n3.1 Motivation-Based Analyses and Their Problems\n\nPleasure has traditionally been connected with motivation, although\ntraditions differ on how. Plato (Charmides 167e1\u20133),\nAristotle (Rhetoric I, 11:1370a16\u201318; DA II,\n3:414b2\u20136 and II, 9:4332b3\u20137; EE II,\n7:1223a34\u201335), and the common sense for which they speak are\npluralist about human motivation. For all these, while one\nsalient kind of motive involves longing for pleasure or pleasant\nthings, people also have other ultimate goals. They compete\nfor honors and other purely competitive goods, seek revenge, and\npursue and avoid other things as well. And sometimes they do so\nbecause of evaluative judgments based in ultimately nonhedonic\ngrounds. Hedonists argued that spontaneous pleasure-seeking is\nevidence of pleasure\u2019s unique status as our ultimate goal and\ngood, as evidenced by the unenculturated and therefore uncorrupted\nappetites and values of infants. The ancient Stoics interpreted these\nphenomena so as to block this hedonist appeal to nature\u2019s\nauthority: pleasure is rather a by-product of the achievement of\nother ends, starting right from the infant\u2019s innate\nimpulses, not toward pleasure, but rather toward biological goods such\nas food, guided by a natural instinct directed toward its\npreservation, which rational motivation may later supersede (Long and\nSedley, 1987, 65A3\u20134; Brunschwig 1986). Augustine influentially\nbuilt on the Stoics in attributing pleasure to the will (CD\nXIV,6); later Western Christian thought mainly followed him.\n\nModern Western philosophers, following Aristotle\u2019s account of\nthe unity of motivation (DA 433a30\u2013b13) and\nAugustine\u2019s counting all motives as loves of the will (but often\nignoring the pluralism about kinds of motive on which they and their\ntraditions equally insisted), have often treated \u2018desire\u2019\nas including all motivation and as of a single kind to be explained on\nthe same pattern. Between 1600 and 1900 they often regarded desire as\nuniformly directed toward one\u2019s own pleasure, along lines\nsuggested by the simple picture. Joseph Butler (1726) responded to\nthis view of human nature as hedonistically selfish by renewing the\nStoic insistence on the priority of motivation to pleasure and also\nthe related medieval view that pleasure always consists in the\nsatisfaction of some appetite. He thereby could argue that\npleasure-seeking without prior motivation would be impossible since\npleasure always consists in the satisfaction of some motive (in his\nlanguage, \u2018passion\u2019) and that altruistic motives are thus\nin principle as capable of leading to a high level of fulfilled\ndesire, and thus of pleasure, as any others. \n\nThere are, however, prima facie counterexamples to taking\ndesire satisfaction to be a necessary condition for pleasure, as Plato\nlong ago pointed out (Philebus 51A\u201352C): we often enjoy\nthings such as sights, sounds, and fragrances that may surprise us\nwithout our having wanted them before, clinging to them when they are\nwith us, or craving them after they are gone. But Butler presumably\nfollowed Plato and his medieval successors in implicitly understanding\nunconscious internally represented needs as of a kind with desires.\nTimothy Schroeder does similarly today (2001, 2004), but in an account\non which pleasure does not require the actual existence of desires or\ntheir satisfaction, but is rather a defeasible sensing of an increase\nin their net satisfaction. However, the basis for such an\ninformational interpretation in the neuroscience appealed to seems\nvery slim (Katz 2005c). Older desire satisfaction accounts of pleasure\nwere susceptible to counterexamples based in desires that expire\nbefore their satisfaction (Brandt 1982). Recent writers avoid these by\nproposing instead the satisfaction of current desires, such as\naffective desire for the continuation of one\u2019s present\nexperiences (Madell 2002, pp.\u00a097\u201398). Other contemporary\nwriters on pleasure, with analytic reductionist projects in folk\npsychology (Davis, 1981a, 1981b, 1982) and metaethics (Heathwood 2006,\n2007), have claimed that pleasure is definable as believed\nsatisfaction of current desire. However, we often don\u2019t enjoy things\nthat we continue to desire, at least for a time. And addiction offers\nsalient cases of such cravings that hang around for a very long time\nwithout leading to pleasure when indulged. And distinguishing\nbelieving or sensing that we are now getting what we want from now\nactually getting it doesn\u2019t generally solve this class of\nproblem. So it appears that it won\u2019t do to make either desire or\nits satisfaction or sensings or beliefs in that satisfaction\nsufficient for pleasure, let alone identical to it, as these\nphilosophers have variously proposed. \n\nOne cannot help suspecting that the attraction of such desire\nsatisfaction related views of pleasure owes something to unconscious\nequivocation between someone\u2019s feeling satisfied and\ndesires\u2019 being satisfied (i.e., fulfilled) merely by\ntheir satisfaction conditions coming to pass, as they might long after\nthe desirer is dead and gone. (This latter use is analogous to the way\nlogicians speak of satisfaction, without any felt contentment or\nhappiness of the linguistic objects considered being in question.) One\nmay view someone\u2019s success in a way that makes\nmere project fulfillment count toward it, but it is hard to\nsee why anything like that, or sensing (Schroeder 2001, 2004) or\nbelieving (Davis and Heathwood) it, should figure directly in an\naccount of someone\u2019s pleasure even while alive. To\nadapt the example of Plato\u2019s Socrates that scandalized his\nCallicles (Gorgias 494A\u2013495A) to apply to Madell, one\nmay intensely and affectively desire to continue one\u2019s\nexperience of scratching one\u2019s itch or rubbing oneself, which\ndesire is simultaneously fulfilled, without oneself experiencing\npleasure in so doing. Fulfilling compulsive or addictive cravings in\ntheir time need not be pleasant. And appropriately limiting\nthe kind of desires, to avoid all such counterexamples, would seem to\nrequire building a relation to pleasure or the like into the desires,\nthus giving up the reductive project. Consonantly with the foregoing,\ndecades of social psychological research using self-ratings of\nhappiness (e.g., Strack, Argyle, and Schwarz 1991) indicates a hedonic\ncomponent (or two, one for positive and one for negative affect)\nunderlying such self-reports that tracks how good people feel but that\nis independent of the component tracking their beliefs about their\nachievement of desired or valued goals. People care about both, but\nfor different reasons.\n\nProblems also face analyzing pleasure in motivational terms other than\n\u201cdesire\u201d more closely tied to behavior. Henry Sidgwick\nrejected simple relational accounts of pleasure as \u201ca feeling we\nseek to bring into consciousness and retain there\u201d or the\n\u201cmotive power\u201d toward this as incapable of giving the\ncorrect \u2018quantitative\u2019 answers about degree of pleasure\ndemanded of any serious definition. He argued that, while\n\u201cpleasures of repose, a warm bath, etc.\u201d might be handled\nby moving to an account in terms of motivational dispositions,\nexcitement often adds motivation disproportionate to \npleasure\u00a0\u2013 an\nobjection that applies to similar behavioral and motivational accounts\ncurrent\n today.[28]\n\n3.2 Is Pleasure\u2019s Goodness Independent of Motivation?\n\nOn the other hand, if there is no close connection between pleasure\nand motivation, why pleasure should be more likely to become an object\nof pursuit rather than of avoidance or indifference seems mysterious.\nNatural selection may explain why animals that already pursue\npleasure and avoid pain should come to enjoy foods that are nutritious\nand to feel pain when they begin to be injured. But it\u2019s not\nclear how it could explain why animals pursue pleasure and avoid pain\nrather than the other way around. Philosophers are well acquainted\nwith the problem of evil in a world created by an all-knowing,\nall-powerful and all-good God or in any similarly good-directed\nteleological order. It\u2019s hard to explain why there should be any\nevil in such a world. But on a completely nonteleological view of\nnature it seems as hard to see why animals especially pursue their own\nor any good (cf. Plato, Phaedo 97B8\u201399C6). Both\nproblems depend on our having an independent grasp of the relevant\nnormative notions. If evil were just whatever God won\u2019t will,\nand an animal\u2019s good or pleasure were just whatever it tends\ntoward or has been naturally selected to pursue, both puzzles would\ndissolve.\n\nThis Problem of Good was, in the past century, raised specifically\nagainst views akin to the simple picture of pleasure, on which\npleasure is valuable by virtue of its intrinsic nature, perhaps just\nbecause of the way it feels in its moment, and independently of our or\nother animals\u2019 actually desiring or pursuing it. It was argued\nthat such a picture of pleasure leaves our pursuit of pleasure an\napparently miraculous conicidence crying out for explanation. This was\nurged not in favor of theology or teleology, but rather in arguing\nthat pleasure must be connected to animal impulse or desire by its\nvery nature (Alston 1967, pp.\u00a0345\u201346; Findlay 1961,\npp.\u00a0175\u201378; McDougall, 1911, pp.\u00a0324\u201325.) It may\nhelp to see this puzzle as a human counterpart of Socrates\u2019\nquestion to Euthyphro, about which comes logically first, the\nrighteousness of pious acts or Divine love of them (Plato,\nEuthyphro, 6E11\u201311B1). Which comes logically first,\nhedonic value or motivation? Perhaps science, by revealing the\nconstitution of pleasure and of its enmeshment with motivation, will\ntell us which of these answers to give to this human Euthyphro\nquestion or else will suggest some third way out. Some value hedonists\nare inclined to answer that we and other animals simply respond to\npleasure\u2019s value by rationally apprehending, and accordingly\npursuing, it (Goldstein 1980, 1989, 2002). While ancients and\nmedievals inhabiting a teleological worldview (on which attraction\ntoward the good required no further explanation) could answer thus, to\nthat extent, it seems, they faced no Problem of Good, which arises to\nthe extent one abandons unexplained teleology. In principle, however,\nnondebunking explanations seem possible. For example, perhaps brute\nidentity or natural relations of pleasure and pain with good and bad\nnutritional or metabolic states provided a basis for natural\nselection, starting from feelings of energy and fatigue representing\nonly themselves, to enable these to progressively connect with and\nrepresent more, and then entangled these representations with\nmotivational reward systems, resulting in the biology discussed in the\nnext section.\n3.3 Dividing Pleasure or Finding True Pleasure?\n\nPlato and later Greek thinkers, as also many of ancient India,\ndistinguished kinds of pleasure connected with craving kinds of desire\nfrom kinds of pleasure that involve no desire or need and hence none\nof the suffering, tension, or stress connected with these. Similar\nquestions arise in interpreting the neuroscience of affect,\nmotivation, and addiction today.\n\nAccording to Adam Smith (1790/1976), \u201c[h]appiness consists in\ntranquillity and enjoyment. Without tranquillity there can be no\nenjoyment; and where there is perfect tranquillity there is scarce any\nthing which is not capable of amusing.\u201d (III, 3, 30, p. 149) And\nin Utilitarianism John Stuart Mill distinguishes between\nexcitement and tranquillity as two sources of contentment, the first\nallowing us to tolerate pain and the second the absence of pleasure\n(1971, Ch. II,\n \u00b613).[29]\n They thus draw on distinctions prominent in Hellenistic traditions,\nsuch as those of Epicurean and Stoic\n thought,[30]\n which (unlike Mill) advised against the more activated and\ndesire-driven forms of pleasure and took the happiest life to be one\nof calm and tranquillity. (Cf. Haybron, 2008 on attunement and\ntranquillity, passim.) Such advice had antecedents in\nPlato\u2019s hostility to pleasure connected with strong desires and\nin Aristotle\u2019s ranking the calm pleasure of reviewing already\npossessed knowledge over those of attaining and producing new\nknowledge, of competitive achievement, and of satisfying worldly\n desires.[31]\n Making such distinctions is consonant with Ivar Labukt\u2019s recent\nsuggestion (2012) that experiential views of pleasure may err not in\nbeing experiential but in neglecting the possibility that pleasure may\nbe more than one kind of experience.\n\nIndic traditions are rich not only in recommendations of nonattachment\nas a path to tranquillity but also in their long history of analysis\nof experiential states associated with traditional meditation\npractices. The Pali Canon of the Theravadin Buddhists, in passages\nthat have parallels in other Buddhist traditions, describes\nprogressively deeper stages of meditative concentration\n(jhana), passing through which one first stops initiating and\nsustaining thought, then ceases also activating joyful interest\n(p\u012bti), and finally loses even the underlying feeling of\n(perhaps nonintentional) pleasure, bliss, or ease (sukha, in\na narrow sense), so that one then abides in a state of equanimous,\nall-accepting upekkha (etymologically, \u2018looking\non\u2019), sometimes traditionally described as without pleasure\n(sukha) or pain (dukkha) but occasionally as\npleasant (sukha). The difference between joyful interest and\n(mere) pleasure (traditionally classified as a feeling rather than\nwith the predominantly intentional states such as joyful interest) is\nexplained in the commentary tradition by the contrast between the\nstate of a hot and weary desert traveler when first hearing of, and\nthen seeing, a pool of water in a shady wood and the state of one\nactually enjoying, or resting after, using\n it.[32]\n The latter is said to be preferred by the meditator as less coarse,\npresumably because it is a purer and more restful pleasure in that it\nis less mixed with eager interest and motivation, which seem tainted\nwith stress, strain, or pain. Similar distinctions, between appetitive\nstates that prepare animals for anticipatory, preparatory, or\ninstrumental action and functionally later consummatory states that\nend these and initiate consummatory behaviors and end in repose, have\nbeen used for at least the past century in the scientific studies of\nbehavior and mind (Sherrington 1906/1947, pp. 329 ff.; W. Craig 1918;\nDavidson 1994).\n\nIn contemporary affective neuroscience, similar interpretative\nquestions arise. Here also we find a condition of activated interest\nand motivation that many have been tempted to identify with pleasure.\nActivation of the brain\u2019s mesolimbic dopamine system organizes many\nespecially of the instrumental pursuits that bring our lives not only\nulterior rewards but also meaning. However it seems also to drive our\ncompulsions and the craving desire unrelieved by euphoria typical at\ntimes of withdrawn cocaine addicts. The apparent paradoxes facing a\ngeneral pleasure interpretation of such dopaminergic activity have led\nmany scientists studying these systems, including former advocates, to\nback off from that and similar interpretations (e.g., Wise 1994). The\ndistinction between pleasure and pain may be made elsewhere in the\nbrain.\n\nThe theoretically inclined affective neuroscientist Kent Berridge has\nfor decades influentially argued that mesolimbic dopamine itself gives\nno true pleasure, but that a core neural basis for a state of\n\u2018liking\u2019 involved in conscious pleasure is mediated by\nother brain activity, including some involving opioid receptors and\nsometimes cannabinoid receptors as well. These seem to be involved in\norganizing the circuit and network activity that makes possible the\nsavoring more prominent in the consummatory, satisfying, and relaxing\nphases of meals, sexual activity, and personal relations and, so far\nas we know, all other pleasure and enjoyment as well, even as\nmesolimbic dopamine \u2019wanting\u2019 seems typically more\nprominent in the earlier and more exploratory, appetitive,\ninstrumental, and approach phases of these. Berridge and his\ncollaborators persuasively argue that without the participation of\nlocalized hedonic \u2019hotspot\u2019 activity there is no true\npleasure, with specific transmitter activity in these small areas\nalways required. While so far as is known such results may apply with\ngenerality, the preponderance of evidence as of yet comes from\ninvasive experiments on rodents, and therefore relies on expressive\nand voluntary behavior to indicate pleasure. (See Berridge references\nand his website linked below for new review articles, Kringelbach\nreferences, papers in their jointly edited 2010. For a complementary\nperspective on relevant opioid systems, see Depue and\nMorrone-Strupinksy 2005, especially \u00a76.1.2,\npp.\u00a0323\u201325). The emerging picture seems not one of\n\u2019pleasure centers\u2019 or \u2019pleasure transmitters\u2019\nbut of diverse neurons capable of behaving flexibly, in different\nmodes, and thus able to collectively self-organize into different\ncircuits and different networks with changing input and\nneuromodulation, some of which differences make the differences\nbetween feeling happy, so-so, or sad. But we must remember that this\nscience is still very much a work in progress and that the picture\nis growing more, not less, complex at this time. \n\nPerhaps the two normally functionally integrated modes of activity,\nBerridge\u2019s \u2018liking\u2019 and \u2018wanting\u2019,\norganize fundamentally different affective, motivational, and\nexperiential states that, however often they occur mixed or temporally\nintermeshed, should be considered distinct successors to our naive and\nundiscriminating common conception of pleasure. However, to the extent\nthat the relevant concept of pleasure is a normative one, so too will\nthis question of succession be. It is tempting to regard\nBerridge\u2019s \u2018liking\u2019, when unmixed with\n\u2018wanting\u2019and pain, as the undriven, pure and true pleasure\nthat contemplatives and philosophers have long been seeking, and to\nfollow Berridge in regarding this \u2018liking\u2019 detachable from\nany object (cf. the stance of 3.3 above), as (true)\npleasure\u00a0\u2013 and dopaminergic \u2018wanting\u2019 as the\nfool\u2019s pleasure dross from which it and we ideally should be\nfreed to live like Epicurean gods. However, we may still, in practice,\nneed to alternate between the preponderance of the two (cf. Mill,\n1871, Ch.\u00a0II,\u00b613). Pleasure may thus commonly arise as a\nrelatively fragile and transient outgrowth of a larger biological\nsyndrome of pursuit and temporary attainment, much as in\nAristotle\u2019s analogy of pleasure\u2019s perfecting an activity\nwith the bloom of youth \u2018coming on top of\u2019 biological\nmaturation, using a term, epigignomenon, earlier applied in\nmedicine to an aggravating symptom arising from a grounding and\nunderlying diseased state (NE X, 4:1174b31\u201333, Liddell\nand Scott, 1940, ad loc. epigignomai). \n\nBased on the scientific evidence, if pleasure comes apart, it will be\nalong such lines, and not along those suggested by concern with\nintentional structure (between attitude and object) or between sensory\npleasure, enjoyment of activities, and so-called propositional\npleasure that armchair philosophical and linguistic analysis suggests.\nBut this should come as no surprise. Mood disorders and their\ntherapies do not discriminate along such a priori lines either\n(Millgram 1997, 124 citing Katz 1986, 119).\n4. Conclusion: Looking Inward, Looking Forward\n\nPerhaps there is only one true pleasure of blissful freedom from\nstress, present in all apparently diverse pleasures, including those\nof the hot bath, sexual consummation, youthful friendship, and freedom\nfrom responsibility for children which figured in the short Afghan\nlist of \u00a72.1\u00a0\u2013 and its impure mixtures with frights\nand with the burning pains of hot spice are only due to ways it can be\ncaused due to our biology and past conditioning. Or perhaps there will\nbe much more intrinsic, and not merely causally relational, diversity.\nHow we and our hedonic experience are situated or constituted in our\nbrains and organisms remains to be seen. And bringing normative wisdom\nto bear on emerging physiology will presumably be called for,\nat least to the extent that the concept of pleasure, at least in its primary use by\nnaive experiencers (who seem to fix the reference of the term in part through\npleasure presenting as good to them), is an evaluative and\nnormative one, however legitimately this may bracketed by scientists\nand philosophers when theorizing about it. (Cf. Sidgwick 1907, 129, on\nthe Stoics taking this appearance to be an always deceptive one, and\nnot only, perhaps like Plato [Moss 2006] and Aristotle [Moss 2012], as\nan occasionally corrigible one.)\n\nIn doing so we may aim to capture much in earlier views while keeping\nin mind that pleasure is something biological, psychological, and\nexperiential which remains in large part unknown, the nature or\ncategory of which it is inappropriate to stipulate a priori. Perhaps\npleasure expresses the unimpeded functioning (Aristotle) of our\nNatural anxiety-free and pain-free State (Epicurus) by which we are\nable to reach outward from our hedonic core to engage with more\nrepresentational brain processes\u00a0\u2013 and through these, with\nlove, to all the world (citations in n. 25). But perhaps pleasure has\na more complex reflexive intentional structure, as suggested in some\nof the medieval literature mentioned in \u00a72.3.1 and\nn.\u00a020\u00a0 ad loc., and understanding the\nself-organization of recurrent neural activity will someday help us to\nintrospect this better. Elements at least of these suggestions and\nothers are compatible. Or perhaps pleasure divides in two, perhaps\nalong the lines between the \u2018wanting\u2019 and\n\u2018liking\u2019 discussed in the preceding section, no one\nnatural kind responding to all we intuitively seek, with dopaminergic\nreward needed to organize our exploratory pleasures of pursuit until\nwe are ready for opioid bliss and repose. But we should also not\nforget more humble and basic biological facts: that mood varies with\nenergy and thus with circadian rhythms affecting body temperature and\nalso with the current availability of nutrients in the blood (Thayer\n1989, 1996); that how much pleasure we experience also depends on\ngetting enough, and good enough, sleep; that pleasure increases immune\nresponse (Rosenkranz et al, 2003), and that how we feel may\ngrow in part out of monitoring bodily homeostasis (Craig 2002, 2009,\n2015). These facts are telling about what may, perhaps, turn out to be\nmore a syndrome of typically causally connected features than a simple\nor unified psychobiological phenomenon, such as would better fit\nphilosophers\u2019 penchant for simple kinds and simple\nexplanations.\n\nThe prospects seem good for new and deep scientific understanding of\npleasure and of how it is organized in the brain. We may have much\nto gain from the practical results of this new\nunderstanding\u00a0\u2013 especially if, as Voznesensky says,\n\nThe main thing in living is human feeling: Are you happy? just fine?\nor\n sad?[33]\n\n\nBut pleasure should also be of special interest even to philosophers\nof mind not especially interested in value or affect, in part for the\nstrong challenge that apparently contentless moods pose to\nrepresentational accounts of mind. Deeply subjective or phenomenal\naspects of our experience, that may more easily be ignored elsewhere\nin the philosophy of mind, seem to stare us in the face here, where\nwhat is at issue centrally seems no informational content or broad\nfunctional role but simply \u201cwhether you\u2019re happy or sad\u201d.\nHowever, appearances of bare intrinsic fact and simple pictures taken\nfor firm foundations have often proved misleading in the studies of\nmind. As the sciences of mind and brain mature, they will offer new\nevidence about pleasure and its roles in our and kindred minds and\nabout whether and how these roles may pull apart, perhaps making\npleasure more than one natural kind. Real answers to major questions\nabout the unity, diversity, and nature of pleasure and its relations\nto pain, motivation, awareness, and value must likely await further\nresults of this new science and their scientifically informed and\nphilosophically sensitive interpretation.",
