    "main_text": "Dominium in Political Thought Before Wyclif\n2. Dominium in Political Thought Before Wyclif\n\nDominium and its generally accepted translation, 'lordship',\nsuggest the sovereignty exercised by one individual over another, but\nRoman law allowed for complexity in distinguishing between property\nownership, its primary referent, and jurisdiction, governance, and\npolitical power. When twelfth-century canon lawyers resurrected Roman\nlaw as the foundation for the ascendant papal monarchy, it was common\nto distinguish between jurisdictive authority, secular power, and the\nuse and possession of private\n property.[1]\n By the beginning of the fourteenth century, dominium largely\nconnoted property ownership, though this usually entailed jurisdictive\nauthority. Most political theorists agreed with Thomas Aquinas in saying that a civil lord who\nsupposed that his jurisdictive authority arose from property ownership\nrather than from a constitution would be a tyrant (Summa\nTheologiae IaIIae, Q.56, a.5; Q.58, a.2). Given that the legal\nuse of dominium referred to property ownership and not to the\nauthority to govern, it seems odd that Wyclif used the term to do so\nmuch more. The reason may be found in the connection of Augustinian\ntheology to theories of the justice of property ownership.  As the\npapal monarchy developed, its theorists, such as\n Giles of Rome,\n found it useful to identify all earthly justice, including just\nproperty ownership, with the source of justice in creation.\n",
