    "main_text": "The Cogito and Doubt || How Indirectly to Doubt Clear and Distinct Perception\n4.3 How Indirectly to Doubt Clear and Distinct Perception\n\nHow could a doubt undermine the cogito? Part of its\nimpressiveness is that I cannot think about my existence without\naffirming it, yet I cannot doubt my existence without thinking about\nit. In short, I simply cannot doubt the proposition \u201cI\nexist\u201d \u2013 or so it appears.\n\nSeeming to reinforce further the suspicion that the cogito\ncannot be doubted is a more general thesis Descartes holds concerning\nthe doubt-resistance of any matters that are clearly and\ndistinctly perceived:\n\n\n[T]he nature of my mind is such that I cannot but assent to these\nthings, at least so long as I clearly perceive them. (Med. 5, AT 7:65,\nCSM 2:45)\n\n[M]y nature is such that so long as I perceive something very clearly\nand distinctly I cannot but believe it to be true. (Med. 5, AT 7:69,\nCSM 2:48)\n\n\nHow, then, is it possible to doubt such matters? According to one\ninterpretation, the answer is that we cannot doubt them\ndirectly, however, we can doubt them in an indirect\nmanner. That is, rather than directing the doubt at particular such\npropositions, as that I exist, or that 2+3=5, the doubt is\ninstead directed at the cognitive faculties by which we\napprehend such propositions. By way of analogy, consider that if a\ncalculator were defective, it would cast doubt on any calculations it\ngenerated. Likewise, if my own mind were in some sense defective, this\nwould cast doubt on any matters I apprehended \u2013 no matter how\nevident those matters might seem. By directing the doubt at the\nveracity of my own cognitive faculties, I do thereby\nindirectly doubt the particular propositions apprehended by\nmeans of those faculties.\n\nA wealth of texts support that this is how the Evil Genius Doubt is\nintended to operate. Consider these (italics are added):\n\n\n[Perhaps some God could have given me a nature such that I was\ndeceived even in matters which seemed most evident.\n(Med. 3, AT 7:36, CSM 2:25)\n\nI can convince myself that I have a natural disposition to go\nwrong from time to time in matters which I think I perceive\nas evidently as can be. (Med. 5, AT 7:70, CSM 2:48)\n\nI saw nothing to rule out the possibility that my natural\nconstitution made me prone to error even in matters which\nseemed to me most true. (Med. 6, AT 7:77, CSM 2:53)\n\n[T]he most serious doubt [arises] from our ignorance about whether our\nnature might not be such as to make us go wrong even in\nmatters which seemed to us utterly evident. (Prin.\n1:30; AT 8a:16, CSM 1:203)\n\n\nAs each passage conveys, the doubt is directed not at the particular\nobject level propositions undermined, but at the possibility of our\nhaving a defective cognitive nature. (In this vein, Carriero helpfully\nrefers to the doubt under the heading, \u2018imperfect-nature\ndoubt\u2019 [2009, 27], rather than Evil Genius Doubt; Newman and\nNelson refer to it as \u2018meta-cognitive doubt\u2019 [1999, 374].)\nAs each passage also conveys, the doubt effectively undermines even\nthe \u201cmost evident\u201d of matters. Because the doubt is\nindirect, it\u2019s blind to the particular propositions it\nundercuts. The relevant question does arguably shift from,\n\u201cHow could a doubt undermine\nthe cogito?\u201d, to \u201cHow could this doubt\nfail to undermine even the cogito?\u201d\nIndeed, the first of the above passages expressly includes the\ncogito with the list of example propositions being\nindirectly called into doubt \u2013 this, in the pivotal fourth \nparagraph of the Third Meditation:\n\nBut what about when I was considering something very simple and\nstraightforward in arithmetic or geometry, for example that two and\nthree added together make five, and so on? Did I not see at least\nthese things clearly enough to affirm their truth? Indeed, the only\nreason for my later judgement that they were open to doubt\nwas that it occurred to me that perhaps some God could have given me a\nnature such that I was deceived even in matters which seemed most\nevident. And whenever my preconceived belief in the supreme power of\nGod comes to mind, I cannot but admit that it would be easy for him,\nif he so desired, to bring it about that I go wrong even in those\nmatters which I think I see utterly clearly with my mind\u2019s eye.\nYet when I turn to the things themselves which I think I\nperceive very clearly, I am so convinced by them that I spontaneously\ndeclare: let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it\nabout that I am nothing, so long as I continue to think I am\nsomething; or make it true at some future time that I have never\nexisted, since it is now true that I exist; or bring it about that two\nand three added together are more or less than five, or anything of\nthis kind in which I see a manifest contradiction. (AT 7:35f, CSM\n2:25; italics added)\n\n\nThe suggestion is of an epistemic schizophrenia, of sorts, depending\non whether one\u2019s attention is directed at the object level\npropositions, or instead at the possibility of our having defective\ncognitive faculties:\n\n\nMoments of epistemic optimism: While I am directly attending\nto a proposition, perceiving it clearly and distinctly, I enjoy an\nirresistible cognitive luminance and my assent is compelled.\n\nMoments of epistemic pessimism: When no longer directly\nattending \u2013 no longer perceiving the proposition clearly and\ndistinctly \u2013 I can entertain the sceptical hypothesis that such\nfeelings of cognitive luminance are epistemically worthless, indeed\narising from a defective cognitive nature.\n\n\nGranted, this indirect doubt is exceedingly hyperbolic. Even so, it\nentails that we lack the full indubitability requisite to\nperfect knowledge. Descartes thus closes the pivotal fourth paragraph,\nclarifying that because of the Evil Genius Doubt, nothing\n(yet) meets the epistemic standard of perfect knowledge:\n\nAnd since I have no cause to think that there is a deceiving God, and\nI do not yet even know for sure whether there is a God at all, any\nreason for doubt which depends simply on this supposition is a very\nslight and, so to speak, metaphysical one. But in order to remove even\nthis slight reason for doubt, as soon as the opportunity arises I must\nexamine whether there is a God, and, if there is, whether he can be a\ndeceiver. For if I do not know this, it seems that I can never be\nquite certain about anything else. (AT 7:36, CSM 2:25)\n\n\nA later Third Meditation passage \u2013 but one occurring prior to\nthe arguments for God \u2013 can be taken to suggest a very different\ninterpretation. On this alternative account, some of the matters we\nclearly and distinctly perceive are fully indubitable,\nthereby counting as perfect knowledge even prior to knowledge of God.\nThe passage has Descartes drawing a distinction between what is\nrevealed by the natural light, and what is taught by\nnature:\n\nWhen I say \u201cNature taught me to think this,\u201d all I mean is\nthat a spontaneous impulse leads me to believe it, not that its truth\nhas been revealed to me by some natural light. There is a big\ndifference here. Whatever is revealed to me by the natural light\n\u2013 for example that from the fact that I am doubting it follows\nthat I exist, and so on \u2013 cannot in any way be open to doubt.\nThis is because there cannot be another faculty both as trustworthy as\nthe natural light and also capable of showing me that such things are\nnot true. But as for my natural impulses, I have often judged in the\npast that they were pushing me in the wrong direction when it was a\nquestion of choosing the good, and I do not see why I should place any\ngreater confidence in them in other matters. (AT 7:38f, CSM 2:26f)\n\n\nThe passage makes clear that the cogito is revealed by\nthe natural light; and on one plausible reading, it conveys that\nthe cogito is utterly immune to doubt \u2013 i.e., it \n\u201ccannot in any way be open to doubt.\u201d On this\nunderstanding, the scope of Evil Genius Doubt is bounded,\nin the sense that not all propositions are vulnerable to the doubt. \nThis is to say that some propositions, including the cogito, \nmay be fully indubitable, thus satisfying the requirements of\nperfect knowledge \u2013 even for atheists.\n\nDefenders of an unbounded doubt interpretation would offer\na different analysis of the passage. First, we saw that Descartes\nearlier claimed that what grounds the extraordinary certainty of the\ncogito is that \u201cthere is simply a clear and distinct\nperception.\u201d Yet, that earlier claim is surprising, if the point\nof the above passage is that the natural light is\nepistemically superior to mere garden variety clarity and\ndistinctness. A remark Descartes makes to Hobbes is relevant:\n\u201cAs everyone knows, a \u2018light in the intellect\u2019 means\ntransparent clarity of cognition\u201d (Replies 3, AT 7:192, CSM\n2:135). This suggests that \u201cnatural light\u201d references are\nsimply another way of talking about clear and distinct perception. On\nthis point, Carriero notes: \u201cI do not see an important\ndistinction for Descartes between something\u2019s being revealed to\nme by the light of nature and my perceiving clearly that thing\u2019s\nbeing the case\u201d (2008, 305). Note further that a bounded doubt\ninterpretation of this passage is at odds with the numerous other\npassages we\u2019ve examined indicating that even the cogito\nis vulnerable to the Evil Genius Doubt.\n\nHow, then, do unbounded doubt interpreters deal with this passage?\nIn context, the point of the natural light passage is not to draw\na distinction between two grades of clear and distinct perception;\nit\u2019s instead to clarify the distinction between the kind of\nprobabilistic reasoning the meditator had invoked in prior remarks,\nand the irresistible evidentness accompanying our very best\ncognitions, such as the cogito. We can indeed take the point\nof the passage to apply to moments of careful attention: even while\ndirectly attending to the probabilistic matters (taught by nature), we\nrecognize that there are grounds for doubt; whereas, when directly\nattending to our epistemically best cognitions (revealed by the\nnatural light), we simply cannot doubt them. This reading renders the\npassage continuous with our reading of the other passages. Again, in\nthe pivotal fourth paragraph of the Third Meditation: \u201cwhen I\nturn to the things themselves which I think I perceive very clearly,\nI am so convinced by them that I spontaneously declare: let whoever\ncan do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that I am nothing, \nso long as I continue to think I am something\u201d; i.e.,\nwhile directly attending to them, the matters revealed by the\nnatural light \u201ccannot in any way be open to doubt.\u201d And\nyet, upon diverting attention, they fall prey to the Evil Genius\nDoubt.\n\n(For further discussion of the cogito, see Beyssade 1993, \nBroughton 2002, Carriero 2009, Cunning 2007, Curley 1978, \nFrankfurt 1966, Hintikka 1962, Kenny 1968, Markie 1992, \nPeacocke 2012, Sarkar 2003, Stroud 2008, Vendler 1984,\nVinci 1998, Williams 1978, and Wilson 1978.)\n",
