    "main_text": "Philosophy of Physics\n5. The Influence of Poincar\u00e9\n\nThere is no doubt that Poincar\u00e9\u2019s work has been very\ninfluential both in the sciences and in philosophy. It was already\nwidely discussed at the time it was first presented \u2014 not only\nin France but also in Germany (e.g. Ferdinand von Lindemann (1904) and\nEmil Meunier (1919))\u2014 and his geometric conventionalism also\ngreatly influenced the logical empiricists, who were linked to\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s follower Louis Rougier (Rougier 1920), one of\nthe organizers of the 1935 Paris congress on scientific philosophy.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism was widely discussed again in\nthe post-WWII literature on spacetime and relativity theory in the\nphilosophy of science. His intervention in the philosophy of\nmathematics has been a source of great inspiration to critics of\nlogicism and others. In the tradition of Kant and Mach, who excluded\n\u201cmetaphysical\u201d speculations from philosophy of science,\nPoincar\u00e9 is also considered to be one of the founders of this\nfield as a discipline (Brenner 2003; Moulines 2006). Poincar\u00e9\nis considered the founder of structural realism and is thought to have\nheld a productive middle of the road position on scientific realism\n(Worrall 1989). His discussion of scientific creativity has spawned a\nliterature of its own and became a standard account of how scientific\ncreativity works. His work on the stability of the solar system\ninfluenced the development of chaos theory and the classical concept\nof causality based on the fact that similar causes produce similar\neffects. Poincar\u00e9 is one of the starting points for arguments\nshowing the compatibility of ontological determinism and\nepistemological indeterminism. His famous recurrence theorem raised\nquestions for statistical mechanics and his work on probability theory\ninfluenced the early work of Hans Reichenbach (Glymour and Eberhardt\n2012).\n\nInsofar as Poincar\u00e9\u2019s philosophical views focus on the\ncomprehension and explanation of the activities and practice of\nmathematicians and scientists, his approach seems more current today\nthan the approach of the logical empiricists, given that the\ncontemporary \u201cpractical turn\u201d in the philosophy of science\npays less tribute to logic and the foundations of mathematics by\nformal representation than did the canonical tradition of the 20th\ncentury philosophy of science. His approach restores the depth to some\nof the critical discussions that the Vienna Circle undertook in the\nspirit of Poincar\u00e9 from the 1930s onward (Heinzmann 2016).\nThough they are missing from standard histories in philosophy of\nscience, the Swiss philosopher Ferdinand Gonseth, the French\nphilosophers Jean Cavaill\u00e8s and Albert Lautman, the Italian\nepistemologist Federico Enriques and, finally, Jean Piaget, all have\nin common a focus on mathematical practice that rejects the logical\nempiricists\u2019 strict distinction of analytic and synthetic\npropositions.\n\nPoincar\u00e9 is often invoked in the philosophy of mathematics\nbecause of his discussions of the paradoxes and his diagnosis, which\nbecame the vicious circle principle. According to\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s pragmatic and anti-Platonist standpoint,\nmathematical definitions and proof-procedures should be limited to\npredicative ones. Herman Weyl (1918) was the first to propose a\npredicative continuum, while later Lorenzen (1955, 1965) and,\nespecially, Kreisel (1960) and Feferman (1964) each tried to find\npredicatively definable sets following Poincar\u00e9\u2019s rough\nsketch. Hintikka (2012) argues that logicians and mathematicians did\nnot know how to implement Poincar\u00e9\u2019s insight because they\ndid not pay enough attention to the quantifier dependence and\nindependence and proposes a solution with IF-logic.\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s critical remarks about the logicist project\nand about the new logic in general have been evaluated many times and\ncontinue to be discussed in the literature and to inspire those with\nsympathy towards intuitionistic or Kantian points of view (Cassirer\n1910; Dingler 1931; Folina 1992; Goldfarb 1988; Heinzmann 1995).\nAlthough the influences on Wittgenstein\u2019s work are notoriously\ndifficult to interpret, there are clearly evident similarities to\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s fundamental views (Rodych 2011).\n\nMoritz Schlick is mainly responsible for bringing an interpretation of\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism to the Logical Empiricists. In\nparticular, he advocated Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventionalism (or\nat least what he thought of as Poincar\u00e9\u2019s\nconventionalism) in letters to Hans Reichenbach in regards to\nReichenbach\u2019s 1920 book The Theory of Relativity and A\nPriori Knowledge (Coffa 1991, Parrini 1998, Friedman 1999;\nOberdan 2009). Later, however, Schlick criticized generalized\nconventionalism in his reprinted and widely-read article of 1935\n\u201cAre Natural Laws Conventions?\u201d Reichenbach took up\ngeometric conventionalism in his Philosophy of Space and Time\n(1928) and Carnap generalized conventions, taking them to be the\nadoption of a formal language of science. Poincar\u00e9 was widely\ncited and discussed in the heyday of the Logical Empiricists, though\nthe meaning of his conventionalism is often distorted, for example,\nwhen Popper characterizes Poincar\u00e9\u2019s conventions as\nanalytic judgments (Popper 2007: chap. VIII). Einstein\u2019s\ninterpretation of Poincar\u00e9 in his important article\n\u201cGeometry and Experience\u201d is emblematic of the fate of his\ngeometric conventionalism in the philosophical literature. Einstein\nsays there that although current physics (i.e., the General Theory of\nRelativity) is not in accord with Poincar\u00e9\u2019s views, he is\ncorrect \u201csub specie aeterni,\u201d that is in\nprinciple in an ideal physics (Einstein 1921). Thus the specific\ngeometric conventionalism that Poincar\u00e9 advocated was opposed,\nbut a generalized form of conventionalism was frequently embraced.\n\nAlthough Poincar\u00e9\u2019s ideas are not the central focus of\nthe discussion of spacetime theories that blossomed in the 1960s and\n1970s, his views are always in the background. Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum\n(1968) defended geometric conventionalism, albeit with his own unique\narguments rather than Poincar\u00e9\u2019s, and critics of\nGr\u00fcnbaum and of conventionalism generally could not help but\ndirect some of their attention to Poincar\u00e9 who was rightly seen\nas the preeminent precursor to all further work on geometric\nconventionalism. Some of this literature does directly engage with\nPoincar\u00e9, notably Torretti (1978).\n\nIn 1989 John Worrall published a paper defending structural realism as\n\u201cthe best of both worlds\u201d in the debate over scientific\nrealism, drawing his inspiration from Poincar\u00e9. The view came\nto be widely discussed in the philosophy of science and spawned\nfurther elaborations and differentiations into different types, such\nas ontic and epistemic structural realism (Worrall 1989; Ladyman\n2009). Poincar\u00e9\u2019s epistemological thesis that all\nstatements depend, at least partially, on a conventional conceptual\nframework is generalized in Kasimir Ajdukiewicz\u2019s radical\nconventionalism (Ajdukiewicz 1978) and is related to the Quinean\nnotion that there are logically incompatible but empirically\nequivalent theories (Quine 1990: chap. 41). (See Poincar\u00e9\n1905b: chap. X.3, which is embedded in the discussion about nominalism\nwith his former pupil \u00c9douard Le Roy for the limits that\nPoincar\u00e9 places on these ideas, and (de Paz 2021) for more on\nthe relation of Le Roy and Poincar\u00e9.))\n\nPoincar\u00e9 also spawned a large literature on scientific\ncreativity with his brief account of his discovery while stepping onto\nan omnibus during an outing of the relation between Fuchsian (or\nautomorphic) functions and non-Euclidean geometries:\n\n\nAt the moment when I put my foot on the step the idea came to me,\nwithout anything in my former thoughts seeming to have paved the way\nfor it, that the transformation that I had used to define the Fuchsian\nfunctions were identical with those of non-Euclidean geometry. (1908:\n49; 1913b: 387\u2013388)\n\n\nThe story has been very widely cited and his four-step account of how\none arrives at novel ideas has been adopted by those presenting the\ndevelopment of creative ideas in analogy with Darwinian blind\nvariation, such as Donald Campbell (1987 [1960]: 99\u2013100) and\nDean K. Simonton (1988: 27\u201333; 1995: 468\u201386; 1999:\n32\u20134); see Kronfeldner for a critical survey of the literature\n(2011: esp. 64\u201365). Poincar\u00e9\u2019s creativity has also\nbeen analyzed and compared to that of other scientists, especially\nEinstein, by Arthur Miller (1984, 1992, 1996b, 1997).\n\nPoincar\u00e9\u2019s writings influenced artists (Henderson 1983),\nespecially the cubist movement which associated their artistic\napproach to that occupied by non-Euclidean geometries in the history\nof geometry. In \u201cthe mathematician of Cubism\u201d Maurice\nPrincet closely studied the work of Poincar\u00e9 (D\u00e9cimo\n2006) and how he influenced Picasso among others, and Albert Gleizes\nand Jean Metzinger (1912), the authors of the famous treatise\n\u201cDu Cubisme\u201d that provides theory to the artistic\nmovement. Poincar\u00e9\u2019s work combines the sensations\nproduced by movement with the sense of touch (as in Science and\nHypothesis) to create the fourth dimension. Maurits Cornelis\nEscher uses a paving motif of the Poincar\u00e9 disk of the\nhyperbolic plane in order to represent an infinite structure in a\nfinite space (see Dunham 2010 (Other Internet Resources), Figure 3, p.\n3). Poincar\u00e9 also directly influenced James Joyce, who\nexperimented with non-linearity and topology in his depiction of\nevents in his literature (McMorran 2020).\n",
