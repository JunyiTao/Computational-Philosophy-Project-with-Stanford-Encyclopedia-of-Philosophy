    "main_text": "What is transcendental realism? || Kant\u2019s criticisms of Leibniz\n5.1 Kant\u2019s criticisms of Leibniz\n\nWhy might Kant characterize Leibniz as holding some version of the\n\u201ctranscendental realist\u201d perspective that he also\nattributes to Newton? This characterization is puzzling, as we have\nseen. If we return to the conceptual matrix above, it is not merely\nthat Leibniz considers space to be the order of the possible relations\namong objects, and therefore to be dependent upon objects and their\nrelations; it is also the case that he explicitly adopts the common\nearly modern view that relations are ideal in the sense that\nthey are somehow dependent upon the\n mind.[20]\n So prima facie, if space is a relational order, or dependent\nupon relations, and relations, in turn, are dependent upon the mind,\nthen it seems that space is itself dependent upon the mind. Thus\nLeibniz appears to deny that space is real in a\nKantian sense. Denying that space is real can be equivalent\nto denying that space is absolute; but Leibniz\u2019s relationalism,\ncoupled with his familiar early modern view of relations (an\nindependent metaphysical thesis), seems to entail that space is\nalso not real in the sense that it is not independent of the\nmind. In what sense, then, can Leibniz be called a transcendental\nrealist? Prima facie, it is unfair to interpret him in this\nway.\n\nWe might return to the first description in the Critique of\nthe Leibnizian position regarding space and time, which appears just\nbefore Kant begins the Metaphysical Exposition of Space. He asks of\nspace and time: \u201cAre they only determinations or also relations\nof things, yet such as would belong to things even if they were not\nintuited?\u201d\n (A23/B38).[21]\n This may suggest what Kant has in mind when he contends that the\nLeibnizians think of space and time as bearing an \u201cabsolute\nreality.\u201d Perhaps what he means is that for Leibniz, space has a\nreality independent of intuition, or that space exists\nindependently of intuition per se, even though it may not be\nindependent of the mind per se. But then what might this idea\nmean in more detail?\n\nIn his extensive discussion of Leibniz in the so-called Amphiboly,\nKant suggests that Leibniz\u2019s transcendental realism might be\nexpressed in his view that space and time are phenomena bene\nfundata:\n\nFourth, the famous doctrine of time and space, in which he\nintellectualized these forms of sensibility, arose solely from this\nvery same deception of transcendental reflection. If I would represent\nouter relations of things through mere understanding, this can be done\nonly through a concept of their reciprocal effect, and if I should\nconnect a state of one and the same thing with another state, then\nthis can only be done in the order of grounds and consequences. Thus\nLeibniz thought of space as a certain [gewisse] order in the community\nof substances, and of time as the dynamic sequence of their states.\nThe uniqueness and independence from things, however, which both of\nthese seem to have in themselves, he ascribed to the\nconfusion of these concepts, which made that which is a mere\nform of dynamical relations be taken for a single intuition subsisting\nby itself and preceding the things themselves. Thus space and time\nbecame the intelligible form of the connection of things (substances\nand their states) in themselves (A275\u20136/B331\u20132).\n\n\nSpace is the order of the actual and possible relations of objects;\nsince objects reflect the order of substances (in some\nvery-difficult-to-specify sense), space itself reflects the order of\nsubstances, albeit in a confused manner (see Langton 1998, 68\u201396).\nWhereas a conceptual representation of this circumstance would provide\none with a representation of the monadic order, sensibility\nmisrepresents space as an independent entity. Hence space is\nindependent of intuition in that it is the order of relations, and\nthat order reflects or expresses the order of substances, which itself\nis independent of\n intuition.[22]\n Hence space is viewed as \u201ca certain order in the community of\nsubstances,\u201d a variant of which Kant himself defended in the\npre-critical period (see Friedman\u2019s introduction to\nMetaphysical Foundations, 174).\n\nThis indicates, in turn, how to interpret the idea that transcendental\nrealism can involve different portrayals of space\u2019s relationship\nwith objects. One may think that space is independent of intuition by\nclaiming that it supervenes on the order of substances (which itself\nis independent of intuition); or, one may think that space is\nindependent of intuition by claiming that space is an independently\nexisting entity. The former is the Leibnizian view, the latter the\nNewtonian. Kant suggests as much in the Transcendental Aesthetic:\n\nWe dispute all claim of time to absolute reality [absolute\nRealit\u00e4t], namely where it would attach to things absolutely as a\ncondition or property even without regard to the form of our sensible\nintuition. Such properties, which pertain to things in themselves, can\nalso never be given to us through the senses. Therefore herein lies\nthe transcendental ideality of time, according to which, if\none abstracts from the subjective condition of our sensible intuition,\nit is nothing at all, and can be considered neither as subsisting nor\nas inhering in the objects in themselves (without their relation to\nour intuition). (A36/B52)\n\n\nThe absolutist construal of transcendental realism contends that space\nand time \u201csubsist\u201d on their own, i.e., independently of\nobjects. The relationalist construal of transcendental realism\ncontends that space and time \u201cinhere\u201d in the objects, that\nis, they do not exist independently of them. And as we have seen,\nLeibniz would also contend that ordinary objects themselves somehow\ninhere in the monadic\n order.[23]\n\nBut how does Leibniz\u2019s conception of the representation of space\nsquare with Kant\u2019s reading? In his latter letter to Clarke,\nLeibniz attempts to show that we can form an idea of space without\nrelying on the notion that space is somehow independent of the\nrelations of objects (L 5: 47). Since he talks of people\n\u201cobserving\u201d various objects and their relations to one\nanother, it can sound as if he thinks that the idea of space is\nobtained through sensory experience of object relations. But which\nidea of space does he have in mind? In other words, what is the\ncontent of the idea of space that he has in mind? He may mean that one\ncan gain a rough and ready idea of space\u2014of a three-dimensional\nmagnitude that is not itself a property of any object or grouping of\nobjects\u2014in the way that he describes. But surely one cannot gain\nthe mathematical view of space in this way, for several reasons that\nLeibniz expresses in the New Essays (as noted above): (a)\nspace and time are entities in pure mathematics; (b) space is a\ncontinuum, and one certainly cannot obtain that notion from the sense\nperception of object relations; and, (c) sense perception will\ngenerate a confused idea, but to have a clear and distinct idea of\nspace, one indicating its properties as a mathematical entity,\nrequires something other than sense perception. So it seems reasonable\nto distinguish between an ordinary, everyday conception of\nspace\u2014one in which we need not consider whether it is infinite\nor finite, infinitely divisible or finitely divisible, or perhaps\nwhether the parallel postulate holds, etc.\u2014and our geometric\nconception of space. There can be little doubt that Kant has our\ngeometric conception of space in mind throughout the Transcendental\nAesthetic\u2014this is clear in the third argument of the\nmetaphysical exposition and throughout the transcendental\nexposition.\n\nSo for Leibniz, <space>confused arises from our\nperceptual experience with objects, but <space>clear &\ndistinct could not possibly so arise. Kant himself emphasizes,\nnot only in the Amphiboly, but also in the Aesthetic itself, that the\nLeibnizians are committed to the view that\n<space>confused arises from our perceptual experience\nof objects and their relations. In \u00a77 of the Aesthetic (in the B\nedition), he writes:\n\nIf they take the second position (as do some metaphysicians of\nnature), and hold space and time to be relations of appearances (next\nto or successive to one another) that are abstracted from experience,\nthough confusedly represented in this abstraction, then they must\ncontest the validity or at least the apodictic certainty of a\npriori mathematical doctrines with respect to actual things\n(e.g., in space), since this certainty does not at all occur a\nposteriori, and according to this view the a priori\nconcepts of space and time are only creatures of the imagination, the\norigin of which must actually be sought in experience, out of whose\nabstracted relations imagination has made something that certainly\ncontains what is general in them but that cannot occur without the\nrestrictions that nature has attached to them. (A39/B56\u2013A40/B57)\n\n\nWe might read Kant\u2019s Leibniz as committed to the following\nclaims:\n\n(1)\n<space>confused arises from our perceptual\n    experience, as outlined in the last letter to Clarke; and,\n(2)\n<space>clear & distinct arises when we\n    remove the confused perceptual elements from\n    <space>confused, thereby obtaining a clear and\n    distinct idea, that is, a conceptual representation of\n    space.\n\nWe can then see the first two arguments in the Metaphysical Exposition\nas attempting to undermine (1), and the second two arguments as\nattempting to undermine (2). Thus Leibniz denies that we have an a\npriori, singular, immediate representation of space. Instead, he\nthinks we begin with an empirical representation of space, remove the\nconfused elements of that representation, and thereby obtain a clear\nand distinct idea, i.e., a conceptual representation of an abstract\nmathematical\n entity.[24]\n\nThis discussion is reminiscent of Kant\u2019s fundamental\ndisagreement with the Leibnizians regarding what Kant calls\n\u201csensibility\u201d and \u201cunderstanding.\u201d In the\nGeneral Remarks on the Aesthetic, we read:\n\nThat, therefore, our entire sensibility is nothing but the confused\nrepresentation of things, which contains solely that which pertains to\nthem in themselves, but only under a heap of marks and partial\nrepresentations that we can never separate from one another\nconsciously, is a falsification of the concept of sensibility and of\nappearance, which renders the entire theory of them useless and empty.\n(A43/B60)\n\nKant wishes to oppose this Leibnizian attitude toward\nsensibility\u2014which he goes on to label an \u201centirely unjust\nperspective\u201d (A44/B62)\u2014in a general but thoroughgoing way\nin the Aesthetic and elsewhere in the Critique. In the\nAmphiboly, for instance, he complains that Leibniz \u201cleft nothing\nfor the senses but the contemptible job of confusing and upsetting the\nrepresentations\u201d of the understanding (A276/B332). Thus Kant\ndoes not merely think that we have a non-empirical, singular,\nimmediate representation of space. He thinks\u2014if we borrow\nLeibnizian terminology\u2014that our clear and distinct\nrepresentation of space is singular and immediate. For Kant, intuition\ncan be a genuine source of clear and distinct representations.\n\nIf we return to Kant\u2019s fundamental conception of representation,\naccording to which sensation is a representation of the\nsubject\u2019s state, and intuition is an \u201cobjective\u201d\nrepresentation, we might characterize Kant\u2019s critical attitude\ntoward the Leibnizians as follows: they conflate intuition with\nsensation, or construe intuition as a kind of sensation. The\nLeibnizians fail to recognize that intuition is a kind of objective\nrepresentation, rather than a merely confused representation, one that\nis confused because it actually represents a state of the subject\nwhile purporting to represent objects. According to\nKant\u2019s Leibniz, when I have a red book in front of me,\nand then have a sensation of redness, my senses represent the book as\nhaving a property that is similar to my sensation, when in fact it\nbears a distinct property (say, a surface texture of some kind). This\nmay be the right view of the sensation of secondary\nqualities\u2014the Leibnizian error lies instead in assimilating all\ncases of perception to this kind of case, and thereby concluding that\nperception presents us only with confused ideas. If we rigorously\ndistinguish sensation from intuition \u00e0 la Kant, then we open\nthe possibility of objective representations that are akin to\nperceptions. We do not have a sensation of an infinite\nEuclidean magnitude (!), but we do have a singular and immediate\nrepresentation of it. The Leibnizians lack room for this option.\n",
