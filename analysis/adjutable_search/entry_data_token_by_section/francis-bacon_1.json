    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy: Struggle with Tradition\n2. Natural Philosophy: Struggle with Tradition\n\n\nBacon's struggle to overcome intellectual blockades and the\ndogmatic slumber of his age and of earlier periods had to be fought on\nmany fronts. Very early on he criticized not only Plato, Aristotle and\nthe Aristotelians, but also humanists and Renaissance scholars such as\nParacelsus and Bernardino Telesio.\n\n\nAlthough Aristotle provided specific axioms for every scientific\ndiscipline, what Bacon found lacking in the Greek philosopher's\nwork was a master principle or general theory of science, which could\nbe applied to all branches of natural history and philosophy (Klein\n2003a). For Bacon, Aristotle's cosmology, as well as his theory\nof science, had become obsolete and consequently so too had many of the\nmedieval thinkers who followed his lead. He does not repudiate\nAristotle completely, but he opposes the humanistic interpretation of\nhim, with its emphasis on syllogism and dialectics (scientia\noperativa versus textual hermeneutics) and the metaphysical\ntreatment of natural philosophy in favor of natural forms (or\nnature's effects as structured modes of action, not artifacts),\nthe stages of which correspond\u2014in the shape of a pyramid of\nknowledge\u2014to the structural order of nature itself.\n\n\nIf any\n \u2018modern\u2019 Aristotelians came near to Bacon, it was\nthe Venetian or Paduan branch, represented by Jacopo Zabarella. On the\nother hand, Bacon criticized Telesio, who\u2014in his view\u2014had only halfway succeeded in overcoming Aristotle's\ndeficiencies. Although we find the debate with Telesio in an\nunpublished text of his middle period (De Principiis atque\nOriginibus, secundum fabulas Cupidinis et Coelum or On\nPrinciples and Origins According to the Fables of Cupid and\nCoelum, written in 1612; Bacon V [1889], 461\u2013500), Bacon\nbegan to struggle with tradition as early as 1603. In Valerius\nTerminus (1603?) he already repudiates any mixture of natural\nphilosophy and divinity; he provides an outline of his new method and\ndetermines that the end of knowledge was \n  \u201ca discovery of all\noperations and possibilities of operations from immortality (if it were\npossible) to the meanest mechanical practice\u201d (Bacon III [1887],\n222). He opposes Aristotelian anticipatio naturae, which\nfavored the inquiry of causes to satisfy the mind instead of those\n  \u201cas will direct him and give him light to new experiences and\ninventions\u201d (Bacon III [1887], 232).\n\n\nWhen Bacon introduces his new systematic structure of the\ndisciplines in The Advancement of Learning (1605), he\ncontinues his struggle with tradition, primarily with classical\nantiquity, rejecting the book learning of the humanists, on the grounds\nthat they \u201chunt more after words than matter\u201d (Bacon III\n[1887], 283). Accordingly, he criticizes the Cambridge University\ncurriculum for placing too much emphasis on dialectical and sophistical\ntraining asked of \u201cminds empty and unfraught with matter\u201d\n(Bacon III [1887], 326). He reformulates and functionally transforms\nAristotle's conception of science as knowledge of necessary\ncauses. He rejects Aristotle's logic, which is based on his\nmetaphysical theory, whereby the false doctrine is implied that the\nexperience which comes to us by means of our senses (things as they\nappear) automatically presents to our understanding things as\nthey are. Simultaneously Aristotle favors the application of\ngeneral and abstract conceptual distinctions, which do not conform to\nthings as they exist. Bacon, however, introduces his new conception of\nphilosophia prima as a meta-level for all scientific\ndisciplines.\n\n\nFrom 1606 to 1612 Bacon pursued his work on natural philosophy,\nstill under the auspices of a struggle with tradition. This tendency is\nexemplified in the unpublished tracts Temporis partus\nmasculus, 1603/1608 (Bacon III [1887], 521\u201331),\nCogitata et Visa, 1607 (Bacon III, 591\u2013620),\nRedargutio Philosophiarum, 1608 (III, 557\u201385), and\nDe Principiis atque Originibus\u2026, 1612 (Bacon V [1889],\n461\u2013500). Bacon rediscovers the Pre-Socratic philosophers for\nhimself, especially the atomists and among them Democritus as the\nleading figure. He gives preference to Democritus' natural philosophy\nin contrast to the scholastic\u2014and thus Aristotelian\u2014focus\non deductive logic and belief in authorities. Bacon does not expect\nany approach based on tradition to start with a direct investigation\nof nature and then to ascend to empirical and general knowledge. This\ncriticism is extended to Renaissance alchemy, magic, and astrology\n(Temporis partus masculus), because the \u2018methods\u2019\nof these \u2018disciplines\u2019 are based on occasional insights,\nbut do not command strategies to reproduce the natural effects under\ninvestigation. His criticism also concerns contemporary technical\nliterature, in so far as it lacks a new view of nature and an\ninnovative methodological program. Bacon takes to task the ancients,\nthe scholastics and also the moderns. He not only criticizes Plato,\nAristotle, and Galen for these failings, but also Jean Fernel,\nParacelsus, and Telesio, while praising the Greek atomists and Roger\nBacon.\n\n\nBacon's manuscripts already mention the doctrine of the idols\nas a necessary condition for constituting scientia operativa.\nIn Cogitata et Visa he compares deductive logic as used by the\nscholastics to a spider's web, which is drawn out of its own\nentrails, whereas the bee is introduced as an image of scientia\noperativa. Like a bee, the empiricist, by means of his inductive\nmethod, collects the natural matter or products and then works them up\ninto knowledge in order to produce honey, which is useful for healthy\nnutrition.\n\n\nIn Bacon's follow-up paper, Redargutio\nPhilosophiarum, he carries on his empiricist project by referring\nto the doctrine of twofold truth, while in De Principiis atque\nOriginibus he rejects alchemical theories concerning the\ntransformation of substances in favor of Greek atomism. But in the same\ntext he sharply criticizes his contemporary Telesio for propagating a\nnon-experimental halfway house empiricism. Though Telesio proves to be\na moderate \u2018modern\u2019, he clings to the Aristotelian\nframework by continuing to believe in the quinta essentia and\nin the doctrine of the two worlds, which presupposes two modes of\nnatural law (one mode for the sublunary and another for the superlunary\nsphere).\n",
