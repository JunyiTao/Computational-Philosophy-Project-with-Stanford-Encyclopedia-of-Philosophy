Rectifying Names (zhengming \u6b63\u540d)\n\nXunzi\u2019s famous essay on language, \u201cRectifying Names\u201d\n(\u201cZhengming\u201d \u6b63\u540d) includes some impressive\ninsights into the nature of verbal communication (William S-Y. Wang\n1989: 186\u201389), but the primary concern of the chapter is\nmorality, not linguistics (Fraser 2016: 293\u201396). The thrust of\nthe essay is easily missed because a few of Xunzi\u2019s comments\nsound as though they came out of a modern pragmatics textbook, e.g.,\n\u201cNames have no inherent appropriateness. We designate them [by\nsome word] in order to name them\u201d (Xunzi 22.2g).\nAlthough this may sound like something that Ferdinand de Saussure\n(1857\u20131913) could have written, Xunzi was not interested in the\nsame questions as modern linguists. In \u201cRectifying Names\u201d,\nXunzi also discusses sophistic paradoxes that were rampant in his day\n(the most famous being \u201cA white horse is not a\n horse\u201d),[9]\n dividing them into three typological categories. His conclusion\ndiscloses that his main purpose is not a proper taxonomy of falsidical\nparadoxes (for this term, see Quine 1976: 3), but an assertion of the\nmoral purpose of language: \n\n\nAll heretical theories and aberrant sayings depart from the correct\nWay and are presumptuously crafted according to these three categories\nof delusion. (Xunzi 22.3d) \n\n\nThe paradoxes of the sophists cannot be used as a basis for moral\ngovernance, and thus would be objectionable even if they were not in\nfact false; they are \u201cdisputes with no use\u201d\n(Xunzi 6.6).\n\nThe only legitimate purpose of language, like that of government\nitself, is to serve as the king\u2019s tool in propagating moral\nexcellence: \n\n\nWhen one who is a king determines names, if names are fixed and\nrealities distinguished, if the Way is practiced and his intentions\ncommunicated, then he may cautiously lead the people and unify them by\nthis means. (Xunzi 22.1c) \n\n\nThe task of determining names and then enforcing their use belongs to\nthe king alone, not to any lord and certainly not to the people.\n\u201cOne who is a king\u201d (wangzhe \u738b\u8005)\nrefers not to the person who happens to be sitting on the throne, but\nsomeone who has lived up to the moral requirements of that office and\nduly rules the world by his charismatic example. Accordingly, a phrase\nlike \u201cleading and unifying the people\u201d refers not to\nexpedient rulership, but to implementing the Confucian project of\nmorally transforming the world. Language is useful in that enterprise\nbecause, without it, the people could not even understand the\nruler\u2019s wishes, let alone carry them out.\n\nJust as the rituals need to be based on the foundation of the Way, the\nruler\u2019s names, though they can be arbitrary as designations,\nmust correspond to reality. You can make up the word for\n\u201creality\u201d, but you cannot make up reality. \u201cSame and\ndifferent\u201d (tongyi \u540c\u7570) are distinguished\nby the so-called \u201cHeaven-endowed bureaux\u201d\n(tianguan \u5929\u5b98), i.e. the eyes, ears, mouth,\nnose, body, and heart-mind. For most of these, we might say\n\u201csenses\u201d or \u201csense organs\u201d in English, but the\nheart-mind (xin \u5fc3) is an exceptional case, for it is\nsaid to be able to distinguish \u201cstatements, reasons, happiness,\nresentment, grief, joy, love, hate, and desire\u201d (Xunzi\n22.d), which are not simply sense data. The heart-mind will be treated\nmore fully in the next section.\n\nThe suggestion that we rely upon our senses to perceive the world\naround us represents a substantial claim on Xunzi\u2019s part,\nbecause other philosophers had already suggested that reality is not\nstraightforwardly discerned; on the contrary, one\u2019s partial\nperspective on reality necessarily informs one\u2019s perception of\nit. This was, essentially, the argument in \u201cDiscourse on the\nEquality of Things\u201d (\u201cQiwu lun\u201d\n\u9f4a\u7269\u8ad6), an important chapter in Zhuangzi\n\u838a\u5b50 (e.g., Graham 1989: 176\u201383). For Xunzi,\nhowever, reality is reality, regardless of how we perceive it. Once\nagain, some scholars (e.g., Hagen 2007: 59\u201384) question whether\nXunzi is such a strong realist, but a constructivist interpretation is\ndifficult to reconcile with Xunzi\u2019s repeated assertions that\nlanguage must conform to reality and the Way, e.g., \u201cNames are\nthat by which one defines different real objects\u201d\n(Xunzi 22.3f).\n",
