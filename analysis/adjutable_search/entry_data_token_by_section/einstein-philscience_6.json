Conclusion: Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Physicist\n\nEinstein\u2019s influence on twentieth-century philosophy of science is\ncomparable to his influence on twentieth-century physics (Howard\n2014). What made that possible? One explanation looks to the\ninstitutional and disciplinary history of theoretical physics and the\nphilosophy of science. Each was, in its own domain, a new mode of\nthought in the latter nineteenth century, and each finally began to\nsecure for itself a solid institutional basis in the early twentieth\ncentury. In a curious way, the two movements helped one another.\nPhilosophers of science helped to legitimate theoretical physics by\nlocating the significant cognitive content of science in its theories.\nTheoretical physicists helped to legitimate the philosophy of science\nby providing for analysis a subject matter that was radically\nreshaping our understanding of nature and the place of humankind\nwithin it. In some cases the help was even more direct, as with the\nwork of Einstein and Max Planck in the mid-1920s to create in the\nphysics department at the University of Berlin a chair in the\nphilosophy of science for Reichenbach (see Hecht and Hartmann 1982).\nAnd we should remember the example of the physicists Mach and Ludwig\nBoltzmann who were the first two occupants of the new chair for the\nphilosophy of science at the University of Vienna at the turn of the\ncentury.\n\nAnother explanation looks to the education of young physicists in\nEinstein\u2019s day. Not only was Einstein\u2019s own youthful reading heavily\nfocused on philosophy, more generally, and the philosophy of science,\nin particular (for an overview, see Einstein 1989, xxiv\u2013xxv; see\nalso Howard 1994b), in which respect he was not unlike other\nphysicists of his generation, but also his university physics\ncurriculum included a required course on \u201cThe Theory of\nScientific Thought\u201d (see Einstein 1987, Doc. 28). An obvious\nquestion is whether or not the early cultivation of a philosophical\nhabit of mind made a difference in the way Einstein and his\ncontemporaries approached physics. As indicated by his November 1944\nletter to Robert Thorton quoted at the beginning of this article,\nEinstein thought that it did. \n",
