    "main_text": "Gibbsian Statistical Mechanics (GSM) || Coarse-Graining\n6.4 Coarse-Graining\n\nGibbs was aware of the problems with the approach to equilibrium and\nproposed coarse-graining as a solution (Gibbs 1902 [1981]: Ch. 12).\nThis notion has since been endorsed by many practitioners (see, for\ninstance, Farquhar 1964 and O. Penrose 1970). We have already\nencountered coarse-graining in\n \u00a74.2.\n The use of it\u00a0here is different, though, because we are now\nputting a grid on the full state space \\(X\\) and not just on the\none-particle space. One can then define a coarse-grained density\n\\(\\bar{\\rho}\\) by saying that at every point\u00a0\\(x\\) in \\(X\\) the\nvalue of \\(\\bar{\\rho}\\) is the average of \\(\\rho\\) over the grid cell\nin which \\(x\\) lies. The advantage of coarse-graining is that the\ncoarse-grained distribution is not subject to the same limitations as\nthe original distribution. Specifically, let us call the Gibbs entropy\nthat is calculated with the coarse-grained distribution the\ncoarse-grained Gibbs entropy. It now turns out that coarse-grained\nGibbs entropy is not a constant of motion and it is possible for the\nentropy to increase. This re-opens the avenue of understanding the\napproach to equilibrium in terms of an increase of the entropy. It is\nalso possible for the coarse-grained distribution to evolve so that it\nis spread out evenly over the entire available space and thereby comes\nto look like a micro-canonical equilibrium distribution. Such a\ndistribution is also known as the quasi-equilibrium equilibrium\ndistribution (Blatt 1959; Ridderbos 2002).\n\nCoarse-graining raises two questions. First, the coarse-grained\nentropy can increase and the system can approach a\ncoarse-grained equilibrium, but under what circumstances will it\nactually do so? Second, is it legitimate to replace standard\nequilibrium by quasi-equilibrium?\n\nAs regards the first question, the standard answer (which also goes\nback to Gibbs) is that the system has to be mixing.\nIntuitively speaking, a system is mixing if every subset of \\(X\\) ends\nup being spread out evenly over the entire state space in the long run\n(for a more detailed account of mixing see entry on\n the ergodic hierarchy).\n The problem is that mixing is a very demanding condition. In fact,\nbeing mixing implies being ergodic (because mixing is strictly\nstronger than ergodicity). As we have already noticed, many relevant\nsystems are not ergodic, and hence a fortiori not mixing.\nEven if a system is mixing, the mixed state is only achieved in the\nlimit for \\(t \\rightarrow \\infty\\), but real physical systems reach\nequilibrium in finite time (indeed, in most cases rather quickly).\n\nAs regards the second question, the first point to note is that a\nsilent shift has occurred: Gibbs initially defined equilibrium through\nstationarity while the above argument defines it through uniformity.\nThis needs further justification, but in principle there would seem to\nbe nothing to stop us from redefining equilibrium in this way.\n\nThe motivation for adopting quasi-equilibrium is that \\(\\bar{\\rho}\\)\nand \\(\\rho\\) are empirically indistinguishable. If the size of the\ngrid is below the measurement precision, no measurement will be able\nto tell the difference between the two, and phase averages calculated\nwith the two distributions agree. Hence, hence there is no reason to\nprefer \\(\\rho\\) to \\(\\bar{\\rho}\\).\n\nThis premise has been challenged. Blatt (1959) and Ridderbos and\nRedhead (1998) argue that this is wrong because the spin-echo\nexperiment (Hahn 1950) makes it possible to empirically discern\nbetween \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\bar{\\rho}\\). The weight of this experiment\ncontinues to be discussed controversially, with some authors insisting\nthat it invalidates the coarse gaining approach (Ridderbos 2002) and\nothers insisting that coarse-graining can still be defended (Ainsworth\n2005; Lavis 2004; Robertson 2020).
