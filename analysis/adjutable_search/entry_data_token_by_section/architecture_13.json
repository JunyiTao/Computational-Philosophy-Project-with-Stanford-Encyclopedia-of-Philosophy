    "main_text": "Architectural Experience, Knowledge, and Appreciation || Experience of Architecture\n6.1 Experience of Architecture\nA staple of philosophy of art is that our experience of art\nobjects\u2014direct or otherwise\u2014is central to basic belief\nformation about them (first and foremost, aesthetic belief and\nappreciation of art objects). The philosophy of architecture is\ngenerally in agreement, though architectural objects may be of special\ncharacter in this regard, as our experiences of them gives rise to or\ninfluences an extended range of psychological states.  Beyond pleasure\nin architectural beauty or other \u201cpositive\u201d aesthetic\nproperties, experience of built structures also contributes to neutral\nand less positive states of mind, and shapes how we broadly take in\nour environment. A piece of that environmental understanding is local\nto the built structure itself: the ways we experience architectural\nobjects may contribute to how we comprehend, and interact with, those\nobjects.\nIn addition to facilitating understanding, appreciation, or use of\narchitectural objects, experience might also play\u2014or\nreflect\u2014a constitutive role. On Scruton\u2019s view, experience\nconstitutes for us the architectural object as an aesthetic\nobject (1979/2013). For Ingarden (1962), architectural experience\nentails not only our cognitive grasp of the built structure\u2019s\nphysicality but as well our grasp of its designation as a specifically\narchitectural object rather than, say, as an arrangement of\nbricks that happens to have the structure of a house.\nThe content and corresponding faculties of architectural experience\nlikely include some mix of the cognitive, emotive, and sensual.\nWhereas an abstractist may claim that experience of architectural\nobjects is solely a matter of intellectual grasp, even an\nanti-abstractist formalist needs the sensory as well to account for\nexperience of concrete shapes. Abstractist intellectualism\nnotwithstanding, accounts of architectural experience typically focus\non multiple content modalities. Sauchelli (2012a) proposes the use of\ncognition in grasping pleasure (\u201cintellectual pleasure\u201d)\nas a central feature of architectural experience. The idea is that\nfully comprehending the pleasure of the experience and thereby\nestablishing its aesthetic value requires cognition, in the form of\nattention to details and understanding of the architectural\nobject. \nA blend of the cognitive and sensual is also characteristic of\nScruton\u2019s proposed \u201cimaginative\nperception\u201d\u2014the notion that we may perceive the\ndetails of built structures in various ways, depending on directions\nthat our imagination takes us. Scruton (1979/2013) takes this\ncognitive act\u2014reminiscent of seeing-as and free play of the\nimagination\u2014as crucial to architectural experience. We are at\nall turns required to make interpretative choices in parsing ambiguous\nor multiform aspects of the built environment. Scruton focuses on\nvoluntary deployment of the imagination in perception at a\nmacro-level, concerning such matters as whether we see a sequence of\ncolumns as grouped one way or another, or see pilasters as ornamental\nor structural. The voluntary aspect of this account is critical to\nScruton\u2019s emphasis on the importance of taste and discrimination\nto architectural aesthetics. In this, he loosely tracks Geoffrey\nScott\u2019s view of architectural experience as \u201csensuous\nperception\u201d interpreted through attendant values\n(1914/1924).\nA generalized version of this account looks to perceptual tasks at\na more granular level. Our experiences of space and spatial\npositioning, depth, edge detection, color, and light yield multiple\ninterpretative possibilities across architectural objects, including\nthe simplest forms and smallest or largest parts of objects.  These\nperceptual tasks are pervasive and constant; sometimes involuntary and\nin the background, and other times as shaped by our willful\nimagining. If the involuntary tasks also represent or shape\ninterpretative acts, architectural experience by Scruton\u2019s\nmeasure is that much less subject to aesthetic taste or\ndiscrimination.\nThe dimensions of architectural experience are even larger when\ntaking into account the full breadth of the sensual. Following a long\ntradition of viewing architecture through art historical lenses,\nScruton focuses on architectural experience as primarily visual and\nstatic. In addition, though, other sensory modalities are factors:\nchanges in aesthetic judgments follow changes in those other sensory\nexperiences (Sauchelli 2012a). Such modalities among the non-visual\ninclude the tactile, aural, and olfactory.  Moreover, much\narchitectural experience is proprioceptive, incorporating visual\ninformation into a broader set of stimuli to grasp bodily position and\nmovement in relation to the built environment.\nSensation of movement might seem irrelevant to experiencing an\nimmobile object, save for the fact that, in architecture (as in\nsculpture) not all facets of a given whole work, or many other\narchitectural objects, can be perceived at the same time. The\nspectator or user must move around or within the object to perceive\nany significant percentage of it, much less the whole. Experience of\nmovement around architectural objects highlights for us the design\nfeature of circulatory paths and contributes to grasping an\nobject\u2019s formal features (such as rhythm in spatial patterns)\nand perhaps, at least derivatively, its aesthetic features (such as\nsomberness) (Sauchelli 2012a; Rasmussen 1959). These aspects of\narchitectural experience capture the immersive nature of a\nspectator\u2019s or user\u2019s relationship to a built\nstructure. Further aspects of our experience may capture the\narchitectural object\u2019s immersion in its larger\nenvironment and surroundings, its \u201clocalized nature\u201d or\ncontext and \u201csense of location\u201d (Carlson 1994). As\narchitectural objects standardly shape our actual, imagined, or\nremembered bodily engagement, so are our richest experiences of\narchitecture informed by such engagement (J. Robinson 2012).\nCentral as bodily experience may be, it cannot be the only source\nof architectural beliefs. Considering the great breadth of the\narchitectural enterprise, it may not even be the best source.  Other\nsources include access to beliefs about works through standard\nrepresentational modes that are not the works themselves, transmission\nof tacit working knowledge through apprenticeship learning, and\ncollective belief formation through client briefings and studio group\ncritical assessment (\u201ccrits\u201d). On these and other bases an\narchitectural knowledge of special character is built.\n",
