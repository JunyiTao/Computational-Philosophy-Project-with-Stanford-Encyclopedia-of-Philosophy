    "main_text": "Propositionalism\n3. Propositionalism\n\nThe idea of uncovering hidden material to provide NPs in notional\nreadings of intensional VPs with sentential scope was prominently\nendorsed in (Quine 1956), where the proposal is to paraphrase search\nverbs with \u2018endeavor to find\u2019. So for (5a) we would have\n(5b):\n\n(5a)\n Lois is looking for an extraterrestrial\n\n(5b)\n Lois is endeavoring to find an extraterrestrial\n\n\nPartee (1974, 97) objects that this cannot be the whole story, since\nsearch verbs are not all synonyms (\u2018groping for\u2019 doesn\u2019t\nmean exactly the same as \u2018rummaging about for\u2019), but den\nDikken, Larson, & Ludlow (1996) and Parsons (1997, 381) suggest\nthat the search verb itself be used in place of\n\u2018endeavor\u2019. So we get\n\n(6a)\n Lois is looking to find an extraterrestrial\n\n\nor in somewhat non-Quinean lingo,\n\n(6b)\n Lois is looking in order to make true the proposition that an\nextraterrestrial is such that she herself finds\n it.[3]\n\n\nHere \u2018an extraterrestrial\u2019 is within the scope of\n\u2018looking\u2019 but has the open sentence \u2018she herself\nfinds it\u2019 as its own scope.\n\nIt may or may not be meaning-preserving to replace (5a)\u2019s\nprepositional phrase with (6a)\u2019s purpose clause, but even if it\nis meaning-preserving, that is insufficient to show that (6a) or (6b)\narticulates the semantics of (5a); it may merely be a synonym.\nHowever, with \u2018need\u2019 and desire verbs, evidence for the\npresence of a hidden clause is strong. For example, in\n\n(7)\n Physics needs some new computers soon\n\n\nit makes little sense to construe \u2018soon\u2019 as modifying\n\u2018needs\u2019; it seems rather to modify a hidden\n\u2018get\u2019 or \u2018have\u2019, as is explicit in\n\u2018Physics needs to get some new computers soon\u2019, i.e.,\n\u2018Physics needs it to be the case that, for some new computers,\nit gets them soon\u2019. (For \u2018have\u2019 versus\n\u2018get\u2019, see (Harley 2004).)\n\nSecondly, there is the phenomenon of propositional anaphor (den\nDikken, Larson, & Ludlow 2018, 52\u20133), illustrated in\n\n(8)\n Physics needs some new computers, but its budget won\u2019t allow it.\n\n\nWhat is not allowed is the truth of the proposition that Physics gets\nsome new computers.\n\nThird, attachment ambiguities suggest there is more than one verb\npresent for modifiers to attach to (Dikken, Larson, & Ludlow 1996,\n332):\n\n(9)\n Physics will need some new computers next year\n\n\ncould mean that a need for new computers will arise in the department\nnext year, but could also mean that next year is when Physics should\nget new computers, if its need (which may arise later this\nyear) is to be met.\n\nFinally, ellipsis generates similar ambiguities:\n\n(10)\n Physics will need some new computers before Chemistry\n\n\ncould mean that the need will arise in Physics before it does in\nChemistry, but could also mean that Physics will need to get some new\ncomputers before Chemistry gets any.\n\nHowever, the strength of the case for a hidden \u2018get\u2019 with\n\u2018need\u2019 or \u2018want\u2019 contrasts with the case for\npropositionalism about search verbs. As observed by Partee (1974, 99),\nfor the latter there are no attachment ambiguities like those in (9).\nFor example,\n\n(11)\n Physics will shop for some new computers next year\n\n\ncan only mean that the shopping will occur next year. There is no\nsecond reading, corresponding to the other reading of (9), in which\n\u2018next year\u2019 attaches to a hidden \u2018find/buy\u2019.\nThe phenomena in (8) and (10) also lack parallels with search verbs;\nfor example, \u2018Physics will shop for some new computers before\nChemistry\u2019 lacks a reading that has Physics shopping with the\nfollowing goal: to find/buy new computers before Chemistry finds/buys\nany. And although the propositionalist might offer something like\n\n(12)\n Physics will seek more office space by noon\n\n\nas an analog of (7), it is not easy to decide if (12) genuinely has a\nreading of the \u2018seek to find more office space by noon\u2019\nsort, or whether the hint of such a reading is just an echo of\n(7).\n\nOther groups of intensional transitives, such as depiction verbs and\nevaluative verbs, raise the problem that there is no evident\npropositional paraphrase in the first place. For psychological\ndepiction verbs such as \u2018fantasize\u2019 and\n\u2018imagine\u2019, Parsons (1997, 376) proposes what he calls\n\u201cHamlet ellipsis\u201d: for \u2018Mary imagined a\nunicorn\u2019 we would have the clausal \u2018Mary imagined a\nunicorn to be\u2019. Larson (2001, 233) suggests that the complement\nis a \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cverbless\u201d clause, and for\n\u2018Max visualizes a unicorn\u2019 proposes \u2018Max visualizes\na unicorn in front of him\u2019. This is too specific, for we can\nunderstand \u2018Max visualizes a unicorn\u2019 without knowing\nwhether he visualizes it in front of him, above him or below him, but\neven if we change the paraphrase to \u2018Max visualizes a unicorn\nspatially related to him\u2019, this proposal, as well as Parsons\u2019,\nhave problems with negation: \u2018Mary didn\u2019t imagine a\nunicorn\u2019 is not synonymous with either \u2018Mary didn\u2019t\nimagine a unicorn to be\u2019 or with \u2018Mary didn\u2019t imagine a\nunicorn spatially related to her\u2019, since the first of these\nallows for her to imagine a unicorn but not imagine it to be, the\nsecond, for her to imagine a unicorn but not as spatially related to\nher. There may be philosophical arguments that exclude these\n options,[4]\n but the very fact that a philosophical argument is needed makes the\nproposals unsatisfactory as semantics.\n\nClausal paraphrases for verbs like \u2018fear\u2019 are even less\nlikely, since the extra material in the paraphrase can be read as the\nfocus of the fear, making the paraphrase insufficient. For example,\nfearing x is not the same as fearing encountering x,\nsince it may be the encounter that is feared, say if x is an\nunfearsome individual with a dangerous communicable disease. In the\nsame vein, fearing x is not the same as fearing that\nx will hurt you; for instance, you may fear that your\naccident-prone dentist will hurt you, without fearing the dentist.\n\nWe conclude that if any single approach to intensional transitives is\nto cover all the ground, it will have to be non-propositionalist. But\nit is also possible, perhaps likely, that intensional transitives are\nnot a unitary class, and that propositionalism is correct for some of\nthese verbs but not for others (see further Schwarz 2006, Montague\n2007).\n",
