    "main_text": "Non-singular terms\n9. Non-singular terms\n\n\nThere are many similarities between the semantics of mass nouns and\nplurals, cf. sections 5, 6, and 8. Also, at a very intuitive level, if\nthere are eight pieces of silverware on the table, then the speaker\nseems to refer to eight things at once when he says: The silverware\nthat is on the table comes from Italy. If this intuition is taken\nseriously, then a mass noun isn\u2019t a singular term. Rather, it is a\nnon-singular term that may refer to one or several things at once.\n\n\nNicolas (2008) puts forwards a semantics of mass nouns that does\njustice to this\n intuition (see Laycock (2006), Cocchiarella (2009) and McKay (2016) for related proposals).\nIt is cashed out in \u201cnon-singular\u201d or \u201cplural\u201d\nlogic. In usual logic frameworks, like predicate logic, constants and\nvariables are singular in the following sense. Under any\ninterpretation, a constant is interpreted as one individual, and under\nany assignment, a variable is interpreted as one individual. By\ncontrast, non-singular or plural logic possesses singular and\nnon-singular constants and variables. Under any interpretation and\nvariable assignment, a non-singular term (a constant or a variable) may\nbe interpreted as one or more individuals in the domain of\ninterpretation. In particular, a formula consisting of a predicate\nwhose argument is a non-singular constant is true just in case the\nconstant is interpreted as one or more individuals that jointly satisfy\nthe predicate (cf. Linnebo\n 2017[22]).\nRemark: The claim is not that mass nouns are plurals. It is that\nmass nouns and plurals share a common property, namely the ability to\nrefer non-singularly, to one or several things at once.\n\nThe resulting semantics has the following features:\n\nAxioms guaranteeing the existence of mereological sums are\nreplaced by non-singular or plural reference. (Cf. also Nicolas\n2009, 2017.)\n Combined with a generalized notion of covering, this allows a\ntreatment of identity statements different from that offered by the\nmixed set-theoretic and mereological approach (where what remains\nidentical over time is a certain mereological sum).\n\n\nImagine that three solid bits of clay, the as, were on the\ndesk on July 1st, and two solid bits of clay, the bs, were\non the table on July 2nd. Now consider the statement:\n\nThe clay that was on the desk on July 1st is identical\nwith the clay that was on the table on July\n2nd.\n\nAccording to Nicolas (2008), the sentence is true when a common\nnon-singular covering can be chosen for the as and the\nbs.[23]\nThis means that there are some\nsmall bits of clay, each of which has retained its identity over time.\nOn July 1st, these bits of clay were so arranged that they\nmade up the as (i.e., they were a covering of the as). On July\n2nd, they were arranged differently, in such a way that they\nmade up the bs. This doesn\u2019t require the existence of minimal parts of\nclay. It only requires the existence of a common division of the as and\nthe bs into certain bits of clay. (See Steen 2012, section 2.4, for\nmetaphysical considerations concerning the non-singularist or pluralist\napproach.)\n",
