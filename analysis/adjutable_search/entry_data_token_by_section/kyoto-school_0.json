    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe progenitor of the Kyoto School is\n Nishida Kitar\u014d[1]\n (1870\u20131945). In the Meiji period (1868\u20131912), when Japan\nreopened to the rest of the world after more than two centuries of\nnational isolation, a generation of scholars devoted themselves to\nimporting Western academic fields of inquiry, including\n\u201cphilosophy.\u201d After many years of studying Western\nphilosophy and Eastern classics, alongside a dedicated practice of Zen\nBuddhism, Nishida was the first major modern Japanese thinker to\nsuccessfully go beyond learning from the West to construct an original\nand abidingly influential system of thought. This he began to do in\nhis maiden work, An Inquiry into the Good, published in 1911\n(Nishida 1990). On the basis of this work Nishida obtained a position\nin the Philosophy Department of Kyoto University, where he went on to\nceaselessly develop his thought and to inspire subsequent generations\nof original philosophers, including the two other most prominent\nmembers of the Kyoto School: Tanabe Hajime (1885\u20131962) and\nNishitani Keiji (1900\u20131990).\n\nAs is reflected in the name of the School, its founding members were\nassociated with Kyoto University, the most prestigious university in\nJapan next to Tokyo University. It is perhaps no coincidence that the\nSchool formed in Kyoto, the ancient capital and center of traditional\nJapanese culture, rather than Tokyo, the new capital and center of\nmodernization-via-Westernization. While the Kyoto School philosophers\nall devoted themselves to the study of Western philosophy (indeed they\nmade lasting contributions to the introduction of Western philosophy\ninto Japan), they also kept one foot firmly planted in their native\ntraditions of thought. One Japanese scholar of the Kyoto School writes\nin this regard: \u201cThe keynote of the Kyoto school, as persons\neducated in the traditions of the East despite all they have learned\nfrom the West, has been the attempt to bring the possibilities latent\nin traditional culture into encounter with Western culture\u201d\n(Minamoto 1994, 217).\n\nIt would be misleading, however, if we were to think of the Kyoto\nSchool as merely putting a Western rational mask over Eastern\nintuitive wisdom. Nor would it be entirely accurate to think of them\nas simply using Western philosophical idioms and modes of thought to\ngive modern expression to East Asian Buddhist thought. For not only is\nthe Western influence on their thought more than skin deep, their\nphilosophies are far too original to be straightforwardly equated with\npreexisting Asian thought. Insofar as they can be identified as East\nAsian or Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist thinkers, this must be understood\nin the sense of having critically and creatively\ndeveloped these traditions in philosophical dialogue with Western\nthought. It should be kept in mind that their primary commitment is\nnot to a cultural self-expression, or even to a dialogue between world\nreligions, but rather to a genuinely philosophical search for\ntruth.\n\nThe Kyoto School has become most well known, especially in the West,\nfor its philosophies of religion. Indeed the initial reception of the\nKyoto School in North America took place in university departments of\nReligious Studies, where their philosophies of religion have\nfrequently been viewed as representative of East Asian\nMah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, specifically of the latter\u2019s Zen\nand Shin (True Pure Land)\n schools.[2]\n While the exchange on these terms has been fruitful, this view can be\nmisleading in two respects. First of all, even if, for most of the\nKyoto School thinkers, a philosophy of religion is the ultimate\narche and telos of their thought, it is hardly their\nsole concern. They address a full array of philosophical issues:\nmetaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, philosophical\nanthropology, philosophy of history, philosophy of culture, philosophy\nof language, ethics, political theory, philosophy of art, etc.\n\nSecondly, even when their focus is on the philosophy of religion, they\napproach this topic in a non-dogmatic and often surprisingly\nnon-sectarian manner, drawing on and reinterpreting, for example,\nChristian sources along with Buddhist ones. Even Nishitani, who did in\nfact come to identify his thought with \u201cthe standpoint of\nZen,\u201d adamantly refused the label of a \u201cnatural theologian\nof Zen.\u201d He claimed: \u201cIf I have frequently had occasion to\ndeal with the standpoints of Buddhism, and particularly Zen Buddhism,\nthe fundamental reason is that [the original form of reality and the\noriginal countenance of human being] seem to me to appear there most\nplainly and unmistakably\u201d (NKC X, 288; Nishitani 1982, 261).\n\nKyoto School philosophy, therefore, should be understood neither as a\nbody of Buddhist thought forced into the form of Western garb, nor as\nuniversal discourse (which the West is supposed to have invented or\ndiscovered) dressed up in Japanese garb. Rather, it is best understood\nas a set of unique contributions from the perspective of modern\nJapan\u2014that is, from a Japan that remains substantially\nundergirded by its historical layers of traditional culture at the\nsame time as being thoroughly remodeled by its most recent layer of\nmodernization via appropriation of Western culture\u2014to a nascent\nworldwide dialogue of cross-cultural philosophy.\n\nThis article will proceed as follows. In the following section, I will\nconsider the preliminary issues of how to define the Kyoto School and\nwho to include as its members. The name \u201cKyoto School\u201d has\nbeen used in the past, in some cases rather loosely, to refer to a\nvariety of sets of thinkers. It is therefore necessary to begin by\ndiscussing the question: Just who belongs to exactly what? The third\nand central section of this article will treat what is generally\nconsidered to be the central philosophical concept and contribution of\nthe Kyoto School, namely, its ideas of \u201cabsolute\nnothingness.\u201d After discussing the ostensible contrast between\n\u201cWestern being\u201d and \u201cEastern nothingness,\u201d and\nafter looking at some of the Buddhist and Daoist sources of the idea\nof absolute nothingness, I will discuss the topological, dialectical,\nphenomenological, and existential philosophies of absolute nothingness\ndeveloped by Nishida Kitar\u014d, Tanabe Hajime, Nishitani Keiji, and\nthe central figure of the third generation of the Kyoto School, Ueda\nShizuteru (1926\u20132019). The fourth section will address the\npolitical controversy surrounding the wartime writings and activities\nof the Kyoto School. The first wave of attention paid to the Kyoto\nSchool in the West in the 1980s largely ignored the political debate\nthat had long surrounded the School in Japan. While this lacuna in\nWestern scholarship was amended in the 1990s, notably with the\npublication of Rude Awakenings: Zen, the Kyoto School and the\nQuestion of Nationalism (Heisig & Maraldo 1994), the\npolitical ventures and misadventures of the Kyoto School remain a\nhighly contentious subject (see Maraldo 2006 and Goto-Jones 2008). In\nthe final section of this article I will return to the question of the\ncross-cultural legacy of the Kyoto School as a group of thinkers that\nstood between\u2014and even moved beyond\u2014\u201cEast and\nWest.\u201d\n",
