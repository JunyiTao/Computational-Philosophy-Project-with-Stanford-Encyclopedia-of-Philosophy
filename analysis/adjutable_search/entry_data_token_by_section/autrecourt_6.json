    "main_text": "Natural Philosophy\n7. Semantics\n\n\nAutrecourt did not leave any logical writings, nor does he discuss\nlogic or semantics in the Exigit ordo or in his\ncorrespondence. However, from his theological question and a few of\nthe censured articles it is clear that he was familiar with the\nlogical debates of his time. According to one of the articles,\nAutrecourt claimed that the proposition \u201cMan is an animal\u201d\nis not necessary according to the faith, because in that sense one\ndoes not attend to the necessary connection between its terms. The\narticle should be seen against the background of the sophism\n\u201cMan is an animal\u201d, which received considerable attention\nin the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. It served to clarify the\nrelation between meaning (significatio) and reference\n(suppositio) by investigating the verification of\npropositions concerning empty classes. Would the proposition\n\u201cMan is an animal\u201d still be true if no man exists? This\narticle suggests that Autrecourt may have denied any form of natural\nand metaphysical necessity, and for this reason was condemned (Zupko,\nin Caroti and Grellard, 2006, p. 186)\n\n\nFive other articles that turn up in Autreourt\u2019s condemnation\nconcern the complexe significabile, or what is signified by\nan entire proposition. According to adherents of the doctrine such as\nAdam Wodeham and Gregory of Rimini, the object of knowledge is not the\nproposition, or the things (res) referred to in the external\nworld, but \u201cthat which is signified\u201d by the proposition\n(complexe significabile). One of the problems raised by this\ntheory concerned the ontological status of the complexe\nsignificabile: Is it something (aliquid) or nothing\n(nihil)? Echoes of this and other debates can be found in\nthese articles.\n",
