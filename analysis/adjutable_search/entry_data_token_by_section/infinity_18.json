Probability theory assumes that we\nhave a set of \u201cpossibilities\u201d or \u201coutcomes\u201d,\ncalled a sample space, regarded as ways the world could be,\nor the possible outcomes of a random experiment. For many purposes, an\ninfinite set is assumed. For example, we may toss a coin repeatedly\nand be interested in how many tosses it takes until we see the first\nheads. The number could be 1, or 2, or 3, or \u2026 Here, the sample\nspace is denumerable. Or we might consider picking a point at random\nfrom the [0, 1] interval of the real line\u2014e.g., we might imagine\nthrowing an idealized dart at a representation of that interval, and\nconsider the point on which it lands. Here, the sample space is\nuncountable, because it is infinitely divisible and has limits of\nsequences, but bounded. Or we might consider sampling a quantity that\nis governed by a normal distribution, the bell-shaped distribution\nthat is used to model various quantities in the real world. Here,\ninfinitude enters twice over: the sample space is both uncountable and\nunbounded, being the entire real line.\n\nOrthodox probability theory assigns real numbers between 0\nand 1 (inclusive) to subsets of the sample space, and again we\nencounter infinitude: there are uncountably many possible probability\nvalues. We will soon see how we encounter it again in the way that\nthese values are additive.\n",
