    "main_text": "\n1. Introduction\n\nEverett developed his relative-state formulation of quantum mechanics\nwhile a graduate student in physics at Princeton University. The short\nversion of his doctoral thesis (1957a) was accepted in March 1957 and\na paper (1957b) covering essentially the same material was published\nin July of the same year. The short version of his thesis was revised\nfrom a longer draft thesis that Everett had given John Wheeler, his\nPh.D. adviser, in January 1956 under the title \u201cWave Mechanics\nWithout Probability\u201d. DeWitt and Graham (1973) later published a\nversion of the long thesis in an anthology of papers on\nEverett\u2019s theory. While Everett always favored the description\nof the theory as presented in the long thesis, in part because of\nBohr\u2019s disapproval of Everett\u2019s critical approach, Wheeler\ninsisted on the revisions that led to the much shorter version that\nEverett ultimately defended.\n\nEverett took a job outside academics as a defense analyst in the\nspring of 1956. Subsequent notes and letters indicate that he\ncontinued to be interested in the conceptual problems of quantum\nmechanics and in the reception of his theory, but he did not take an\nactive role in the debates surrounding either. Everett died in 1982.\nSee Byrne (2007) and (2010) for further biographical details and\nBarrett and Byrne (2012) for an annotated collection of\nEverett\u2019s papers, notes, and letters regarding quantum\nmechanics. See also Osnaghi, Freitas, Freire (2009) for an excellent\nintroduction to the history of Everett\u2019s formulation of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nEverett\u2019s relative state formulation was a direct reaction to\nthe measurement problem faced by the standard von Neumann collapse\nformulation of quantum mechanics. Everett understood the measurement\nproblem in the context of his own version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend\nstory, a version published four years before Wigner\u2019s (1961). In\nbrief, Everett\u2019s solution to the problem was to drop the\ncollapse postulate from the standard formulation of quantum mechanics\nthen deduce the empirical predictions of the standard collapse theory\nas the subjective experiences of observers who were themselves modeled\nas physical systems in the theory. The result was his relative-state\ninterpretation of pure wave mechanics.\n\nIn order to understand Everett\u2019s solution to the quantum\nmeasurement problem, it is helpful first to understand just what he\ntook the problem to be. We will start with this, then consider his\npresentation of the relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics\nand the sense in which he took it to solve the quantum measurement\nproblem. We will then consider how one might get a theory that\nprovides a richer account of determinate quantum records and\nprobabilities.\n2. The Measurement Problem\n\nEverett presented the relative-state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics as a way of avoiding the conceptual problems encountered by\nthe standard von Neumann collapse formulation of quantum mechanics.\nEverett took the chief problem to be that the standard theory required\nobservers to be treated as external to the system described by the\ntheory. One consequence of this, he thought, was that the theory\nconsequently fails to provide a consistent description the physical\nuniverse. Everett distinguished between the standard von Neumann\nformulation of quantum mechanics and Bohr\u2019s Copenhagen\ninterpretation. He believed that the latter was in an important sense\nyet less satisfactory as it did not even aim to provide a consistent\ndescription of the process of observation (1956, 152\u20133). We will\nfollow the main argument of Everett\u2019s long thesis starting with\nthe measurement problem as encountered by the standard collapse\ntheory.\n\nThe standard collapse formulation of quantum mechanics, as Everett\nunderstood it, is based on the following principles (von Neumann,\n1955):\n\nRepresentation of States: The state of a physical\nsystem \\(S\\) is represented by an element of unit length in a Hilbert\nspace, a complex-valued vector space with an inner product.\nRepresentation of Observables: Every physical\nobservable \\(O\\) is represented by a Hermitian operator\n\\(\\boldsymbol{O}\\) on the Hilbert space representing states, and every\nHermitian operator corresponds to some physical observable.\nEquivalently, the observable \\(O\\) can be thought of as being\nrepresented by the orthonormal basis consisting of the eigenvectors of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{O}\\).\nStandard Interpretation of States: A system \\(S\\)\nhas a determinate value for an observable \\(O\\), and hence\ndeterminately has the corresponding physical property, if and only if\nthe state of \\(S\\) is represented by an eigenvector of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{O}\\). If so, then one would with certainty get the\ncorresponding eigenvalue as the result of measuring \\(O\\) of\n\\(S\\).\nTwo Dynamical Laws: (a) If\nno measurement is made, then a system \\(S\\)\nevolves in a continuous deterministic way according to the linear\ndynamics, which depends only on the energy properties of the system.\n(b) If a measurement is\nmade of \\(S\\), then the system instantaneously and randomly jumps to\nan eigenstate of the observable being measured. The probability of\neach possible post-measurement state is equal to the norm squared of\nthe projection of the initial state onto the final state.\n\n\nEverett referred to the standard von Neumann theory as the\n\u201cexternal observation formulation of quantum mechanics\u201d\nand discussed it in both the long (1956) and short (1957) versions of\nhis thesis (beginning on pages 73 and 175 respectively). While he\nbelieved that the standard collapse theory was ultimately\nunacceptable, he used it as the starting point for his presentation of\npure wave mechanics. The latter theory he characterized as the\nstandard collapse theory but without the collapse dynamics (rule 4b).\nWe will briefly consider the roles played by rule (4a) and (4b) and\nthe measurement problem then consider Everett\u2019s discussion of\nthe Wigner\u2019s Friend story and his proposal for replacing the\nstandard theory with pure wave mechanics.\n\nThe linear dynamics (rule 4a) plays an essential role in the standard\ncollapse theory. It explains how a system might come to be in a\nsuperpositions of different classical states and how two systems may\ncome to be quantum-mechanically entangled, which in turn explains\nquantum inference effects and quantum nonlocality. But given the\nstandard interpretation of states (rule 3), the linear dynamics cannot\non its own explain how measurements yield determinate measurement\nrecords that exhibit the standard quantum probabilities. For most\ninitial states, the linear dynamics predicts that a measurement\ninteraction would produce a physical record in an entangled\nsuperposition of recording mutually incompatible measurement results,\nsomething like state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) below). On the standard\ninterpretation of states, this is not a state where there is any\ndeterminate physical record at all. Hence, the collapse dynamics (rule\n4b) is apparently essential to how the standard theory explains\ndeterminate physical records, and in doing so it also explains why one\nshould expect each physically possible record with the usual quantum\nprobabilities.\n\nThe deterministic linear dynamics (rule 4a), then, describes how a\nsystem evolves when there is no measurement, and the\nstochastic nonlinear dynamics (rule 4b) describes how a system evolves\nwhen there is a measurement. Note that the term\nmeasurement occurs in the theory as an undefined primitive\nterm. Without saying what it takes for an interaction to count as a\nmeasurement, the theory is at best incomplete since it does not\nindicate when each dynamical law obtains. Further, if one supposes\nthat observers and their measuring devices are physical systems like\nany other (and why wouldn\u2019t they be?), they must also evolve in\na continuous deterministic way, and nothing like the random,\ndiscontinuous evolution described by rule 4b can ever occur. In this\ncase, stipulating a collapse on measurement yields an immediate\ncontradiction. This is the quantum measurement problem. See Barrett\n(2020) and the section on the measurement problem in the entry on\n philosophical issues in quantum theory\n for further discussions.\n\nEverett took the standard formulation of quantum mechanics to be\nlogically inconsistent, and hence untenable, because it did not allow\none to provide a consistent account of nested measurement. He\nillustrated the problem in the context of an \u201camusing, but\nextremely hypothetical drama\u201d (1956, 74\u20138), a\nstory that was famously retold by Eugene Wigner (1961) a few years\nlater.\n\nEverett\u2019s version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend story involved an\nobserver \\(A\\) who knows the state function of some system \\(S\\), and\nknows that it is not an eigenstate of the observable he is about to\nmeasure of it, and an observer \\(B\\) who is in possession of the state\nfunction of the composite system \\(A{+}S\\). Observer \\(A\\) believes\nthat the outcome of her measurement on \\(S\\) will be randomly\ndetermined by rule 4b, hence \\(A\\) attributes to \\(A{+}S\\) a\npost-measurement state describing \\(A\\) as having a determinate\nmeasurement record and \\(S\\) as having collapsed to the corresponding\nstate. Observer \\(B\\), however, attributes the state function of the\nroom after \\(A\\)\u2019s measurement according to the rule 4a, hence\n\\(B\\) attributes to \\(A{+}S\\) an entangled state where, according to\nrule 3, neither \\(A\\) nor \\(S\\) even has a determinate\nquantum-mechanical state of its own. Everett held that since \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) make incompatible state attributions to \\(A{+}S\\), the standard\ncollapse theory commits one to a straightforward contradiction.\n\nIt would be extraordinarily difficult in practice to isolate and\ncontrol a composite system like \\(A{+}S\\) in such a way that \\(B\\)\nwould be able even to calculate how its state evolves. This is one of\nthe reasons Everett referred to the drama as \u201cextremely\nhypothetical\u201d. But he was also careful to explain why this\npractical difficulty was irrelevant to the conceptual problem faced by\nthe standard theory. Indeed, he explicitly rejected that one might\nsimply \u201cdeny the possibility that \\(B\\) could ever be in\npossession of the state function of \\(A{+}S\\).\u201d Rather, he\nargued, that \u201cno matter what the state of \\(A{+}S\\) is, there is\nin principle a complete set of commuting operators for which it is an\neigenstate, so that, at least, the determination of these\nquantities will not affect the state nor in any way disrupt the\noperation of \\(A\\),\u201d nor, he added, are there \u201cfundamental\nrestrictions in the usual theory about the knowability of any\nstate functions.\u201d And he concluded that \u201cit is not\nparticularly relevant whether or not \\(B\\) actually knows the\nprecise state function of \\(A{+}S\\). If he merely believes\nthat the system is described by a state function, which he does not\npresume to know, then the difficulty still exists. He must then\nbelieve that this state function changed deterministically, and hence\nthat there was nothing probabilistic in \\(A\\)\u2019s\ndetermination\u201d (1956, 76). And, Everett argued, \\(B\\) is right\nin so believing.\n\nIt is a key feature of both Everett\u2019s understanding of the\nmeasurement problem and how his own formulation of quantum mechanics\nworked that \\(B\\) might in principle show by means of an interference\nmeasurement that the state resulting from \\(A\\)\u2019s interaction\nwith \\(S\\) was in fact the entangled superposition of incompatible\nrecords predicted by the linear dynamics (a state like\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) below). Indeed, that it is always in\nprinciple possible to make such a measurement is why Everett held\nevery element of the superposition to be real: \u201cIt is \u2026\nimproper to attribute any less validity or \u2018reality\u2019 to\nany element of a superposition than any other element, due to this\never present possibility of obtaining interference effects between the\nelements. All elements of a superposition must be regarded as\nsimultaneously existing\u201d (1956, 150).\n\nThat Everett took the Wigner\u2019s Friend story, which involves an\nexperiment that would be virtually impossible to perform because of\nenvironmental decoherence effects, to pose the central conceptual\nproblem for quantum mechanics is essential to understanding how he\nthought of the measurement problem and what it would take to solve it.\nIn particular, he held that one only has a satisfactory solution to\nthe quantum measurement problem if one can account for nested\nmeasurement in a consistent way. Being able to tell the Wigner\u2019s\nFriend story in one\u2019s theory is a necessary condition for a\nsatisfactory resolution of the quantum measurement problem.\n3. Everett\u2019s Deduction\n\nIn order to solve the measurement problem, Everett proposed dropping\nthe collapse dynamics (rule 4b) from the standard collapse theory and\ntaking the resulting theory to provide a complete and accurate\ndescription of all physical systems at all times. He called the\nresultant theory pure wave mechanics. Everett believed that\nhe could deduce the standard statistical predictions of quantum\nmechanics, the predictions that depend on rule 4b in the standard\ncollapse formulation, in terms of the subjective experiences of\nobservers who are themselves treated as ordinary physical systems\nwithin pure wave mechanics. We will discuss how this deduction was\nsupposed to work in some detail.\n\nEverett sketched the outline of his deduction in the long thesis:\n\nWe shall be able to introduce into [pure wave mechanics] systems which\nrepresent observers. Such systems can be conceived as automatically\nfunctioning machines (servomechanisms) possessing recording devices\n(memory) and which are capable of responding to their environment. The\nbehavior of these observers shall always be treated within the\nframework of wave mechanics. Furthermore, we shall deduce the\nprobabilistic assertions of Process 1 [rule 4b] as subjective\nappearances to such observers, thus placing the theory in\ncorrespondence with experience. We are then led to the novel situation\nin which the formal theory is objectively continuous and causal, while\nsubjectively discontinuous and probabilistic. While this point of view\nthus shall ultimately justify our use of the statistical assertions of\nthe orthodox view, it enables us to do so in a logically consistent\nmanner, allowing for the existence of other observers (1956,\n77\u20138).\n\n\nMore specifically, Everett\u2019s goal was to show that the relative\nrecords of a typical observer in pure wave mechanics would exhibit the\nstatistical properties predicted by the collapse dynamics. In order to\nso, he needed to supplement pure wave mechanics with a small handful\nof background assumptions.\n\nExpressed in the language of his Wigner\u2019s Friend story, Everett\ninsisted on three things: (1) there are no collapses of the\nquantum-mechanical state, hence observer \\(B\\) is correct in\nattributing to \\(A{+}S\\) a state where observer \\(A\\) is in an\nentangled superposition of having recorded mutually incompatible\nresults, (2) there is a sense in which \\(A\\) nevertheless gets a\nperfectly determinate measurement record, and (3) typical sequences of\nsuch records will satisfy the standard quantum statistics.\n\nThe main task in understanding what Everett had in mind is in figuring\nout precisely how the correspondence between the predictions of the\nstandard collapse theory and those of pure wave mechanics was supposed\nto work. One problem is that the former theory is stochastic with\nfundamentally chance events while the latter is deterministic with no\nmention of probabilities whatsoever. Another is that since an observer\nlike \\(A\\) will typically fail to have any determinate record on the\nstandard interpretation of states, one needs a new way of\nunderstanding the post-measurement state of the composite system\n\\(A{+}S\\), a way that provides a sense in which \\(A\\) might be said to\nhave a determinate measurement record.\n\nConsider measuring the \\(x\\)-spin of a spin-\u00bd system. Such a\nsystem will be found to be either \u201c\\(x\\)-spin up\u201d or\n\u201c\\(x\\)-spin down\u201d. Suppose that \\(J\\) is a good observer.\nFor Everett, being a good \\(x\\)-spin observer meant that \\(J\\) has the\nfollowing two dispositions, where the arrows below represent the\ntime-evolution of the composite system as described by rule 4a:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} &|\\ldquo\\mbox{ready}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S \\rightarrow |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S \\\\\n \\tag{2} &|\\ldquo\\mbox{ready}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S \\rightarrow |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSo if \\(J\\) measures a system that is determinately \\(x\\)-spin up,\nthen \\(J\\) will determinately record \u201c\\(x\\)-spin up\u201d; and\nif \\(J\\) measures a system that is determinately \\(x\\)-spin down, then\n\\(J\\) will determinately record \u201c\\(x\\)-spin down\u201d. And in\neach case we will suppose that the spin of the object system \\(S\\) is\nundisturbed by the interaction.\n\nNow consider what happens when \\(J\\) observes the \\(x\\)-spin of a\nsystem that begins in a superposition of \\(x\\)-spin eigenstates:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + |\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nThe initial state of the composite system is: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{ready}\\rdquo\\rangle_J \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S + |\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nHere \\(J\\) is determinately ready to make an \\(x\\)-spin measurement,\nbut the object system \\( S\\), according to rule 3, has no determinate\n\\(x\\)-spin. Given \\(J\\)\u2019s two dispositions and the fact that the\ndeterministic dynamics (rule 4a) is linear, the state of the composite\nsystem after her \\(x\\)-spin measurement will be: \n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J\n|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nCall this state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) . On the standard formulation of\nquantum mechanics, at some point during the measurement interaction\nthe state collapses resulting in either \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\nor \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S,\\]\n\n\neach with probability 1/2. In the former case, \\(J\\) ends up with the\ndeterminate measurement record \u201cspin up\u201d, and in the later\nshe ends up with the determinate measurement record \u201cspin\ndown\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, no such collapse occurs on Everett\u2019s proposal.\nRather, the post-measurement state of the composite system is\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\), the state resulting from the linear dynamics\nalone, an entangled superposition of \\(J\\) recording the result\n\u201cspin up\u201d and \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin up and \\(J\\)\nrecording \u201cspin down\u201d and \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin down. On\nthe standard interpretation of states (rule 3), \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is\nnot a state where \\(J\\) determinately records \u201cspin up\u201d\nnor is it a state where \\(J\\) determinately records \u201cspin\ndown\u201d. Indeed, it is not even a state where \\(J\\) has a\ndeterminate state to call her own as the state of the\ncomposite system does not factor.\n\nFurther, Everett held that one might, at least in principle, show by\nmeans of a Wigner\u2019s Friend interference experiment that the\npost-measurement state is in fact \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\). Consider an\nobservable \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) of the composite system \\(J{+}S\\) that\nhas state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) as an eigenstate corresponding to\neigenvalue +1 and the orthogonal state \n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J\n|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S - |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nas an eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue \\(-1.\\) If Everett is\nright and \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is in fact the post-measurement state,\nthen an observation of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) would always yield \\(+1.\\)\nBut if a collapse occurs in the interaction between \\(J\\) and \\(S,\\)\nthen an \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\)-measurement might yield \\(+1\\) or \\(-1,\\)\neach with probability 1/2 since the post-measurement collapsed states\nare at 45 degree angles to the rays containing the eigenstates of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\).\n\nBy insisting that \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) was in fact the post-measurement\nstate of the composite system, Everett faced two problems. The\ndeterminate-record problem required him to explain how this\nstate is compatible with observer \\(J\\) having a determinate\nmeasurement record. And the probability problem required him\nto recover, in some sense, the standard quantum probabilities for such\ndeterminate records.\n3.1 Determinate Records\n\nEverett appealed to a principle he called the fundamental\nrelativity of states to distinguish between absolute and relative\nstates:\n\nThere does not, in general, exist anything like a single state for one\nsubsystem of a composite system. Subsystems do not possess states that\nare independent of the states of the remainder of the system, so that\nthe subsystem states are generally correlated with one\nanother. One can arbitrarily choose a state for one subsystem, and be\nled to the relative state for the remainder. Thus we are faced with a\nfundamental relativity of states, which is implied by the\nformalism of composite systems. It is meaningless to ask the absolute\nstate of a subsystem\u2014one can only ask the state relative to a\ngiven state of the remainder of the subsystem. (1956, 103; 1957, 180)\n\n\nThe distinction between absolute and relative states allows for a\nricher interpretation of states than that provided by rule 3 alone.\nNamely, it provides a relative state in the post-measurement absolute\nstate on which a relative observer\u2019s determinate measurement\nrecord might supervene.\n\nWhile the absolute state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is one where \\(J\\) has no\ndeterminate absolute record and \\(S\\) has no determinate absolute\n\\(x\\)-spin, \\(J\\) records \u201c\\(x\\)-spin up\u201d relative\nto \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin up and \\(J\\) records \u201c\\(x\\)-spin\ndown\u201d relative to \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin down. Everett\nassociates an observer\u2019s experience with her relative\nrecords:\n\nLet one regard an observer as a subsystem of the composite system:\nobserver + object-system. It is then an inescapable consequence that\nafter the interaction has taken place there will not, generally, exist\na single observer state. There will, however, be a superposition of\nthe composite system states, each element of which contains a definite\nobserver state and a definite relative object-system state.\nFurthermore, as we shall see, each of these relative object\nsystem states will be, approximately, the eigenstates of the\nobservation corresponding to the value obtained by the observer which\nis described by the same element of the superposition. Thus, each\nelement of the resulting superposition describes an observer who\nperceived a definite and generally different result, and to whom it\nappears that the object-system state has been transformed into the\ncorresponding eigenstate. (1956, 78).\n\n\nEach relative observer then has a determinate relative record. That\nis, each element or branch of \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) describes a relative\nobserver with a corresponding determinate relative measurement record.\nThe sense in which this accounts for our experience is given by\nEverett\u2019s notion of empirical faithfulness, something we will\ndiscuss after laying the groundwork for his account for quantum\nprobabilities.\n3.2 Probabilities\n\nEverett sought to address the probability problem by showing that a\ntypical sequence of relative records will exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics. To show that records in typical branches exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics he needed a typicality measure over\nbranches, something that is not given by pure wave mechanics itself.\nAs he put the point, \u201cIn order to make quantitative statements\nabout the relative frequencies of the different possible results of\nobservation which are recorded in the memory of a typical observer we\nmust have a method of selecting a typical observer\u201d\n(1956, 124).\n\nEverett introduced his typicality measure by imposing a sequence of\nformal constraints until a measure was uniquely determined. In\nparticular, he required that the typicality measure \\(m\\) (1) satisfy\nthe standard axioms for being a probability measure, (2) be a positive\nfunction of the complex-valued coefficients associated with the\nbranches of the superposition, and (3) satisfy a sub-branch additivity\ncondition to ensure that the sum of the measures on branches are equal\nto the measure on the initial ancestor branch before branching.\nTogether, he took these constraints to determine \\(m\\) to be the\nnorm-squared-amplitude measure over branches. See Everett (1956,\n123\u20138) and (1957, 188\u201393) and Barrett and Byrne (2012,\n274\u20135) for his description of his typicality measure, how he\njustified it, and how he intended for it to work in his account of\nquantum statistics.\n\nConsider state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) above. Here \\(m\\) assigns measure\n1/2 to the first branch and measure 1/2 to the second branch. While\n\\(m\\) assigns a measure to each branch equal to the probability that\nwould be assigned to the corresponding outcome on the standard\ncollapse theory, \\(m\\) is a typically measure and hence says\nnothing whatsoever regarding the probability of the\nalternative measurement outcomes. Indeed, inasmuch as he took all\nbranches to be equally actual, Everett took the probability associated\nwith each branch to be one. While the typicality measure is across\nbranches, the subjective appearance of quantum probabilities was\nto be explained by the sequence of records within a typical\nbranch.\n\nThe setup for Everett\u2019s argument went as follows. Consider a\nmeasuring device M that is ready to make and record an infinite series\nof measurements on each of an infinite series of systems \\(S_k\\) each\nin state: \n\\[\\alpha |\\!\\uparrow_x\\rangle_{S_k} + \\beta\n|\\!\\downarrow_x\\rangle_{S_k}.\\]\n\n\nSuppose that M interacts with each system in turn and perfectly\ncorrelates its \\(k\\)th memory register with the \\(x\\)-spin of system\n\\(S_k\\) by the linear dynamics. This will produce an increasingly\ncomplicated entangled superposition of different sequences of\nmeasurement outcomes. After one measurement, the state of M and\n\\(S_1\\) will be: \n\n\\[\\alpha |\\ldquo{\\uparrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_1} +\n\\beta |\\ldquo{\\downarrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_1}.\\]\n\n\nAfter two measurements, the state of M, \\(S_1\\), and \\(S_2\\) will\nbe \n\\[\\begin{aligned} \n\\alpha^2 |\\ldquo{\\uparrow\\uparrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_2} &+ \\alpha\\beta |\\ldquo{\\uparrow\\downarrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_2} \\\\ &+ \\beta\\alpha |\\ldquo{\\downarrow\\uparrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\uparrow\\rangle_{S_2} + \\beta^2 |\\ldquo{\\downarrow\\downarrow}\\rdquo\\rangle_M |\\!\\downarrow\\rangle_{S_1} |\\!\\downarrow_x\\rangle_{S_2}. \n\\end{aligned}\\]\n\n\nHere there are four branches, and again the typically measure for each\nbranch is the norm-squared of the associated amplitude. After \\(k\\)\nmeasurements in the present case there will be \\(2^k\\) terms\nrepresenting all possible sequences of records.\n\nWithin this framework, Everett argued that in the limit as the number\nof measurements gets large, almost all branches in measure \\(m\\) will\ndescribe sequences of measurement records that are randomly\ndistributed with the standard quantum statistics. While he just\nsketched the corresponding results, one can show that:\nRelative Frequency: For any \\(\\delta>0\\) and\n\\(\\epsilon>0\\), there exists a \\(k\\) such that after \\(k\\)\nmeasurements the sum of the norm-squared of the amplitude associated\nwith each branch where the distribution of spin-up results is within\n\\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(|\\alpha|^2\\) and the distribution of spin-down\nresults is within \\(\\epsilon\\) of \\(|\\beta|^2\\) is within \\(\\delta\\)\nof one.\n\n\nand\n\nRandomness: The sum of the norm-squared of the\namplitude associated with each branch where the sequence of relative\nrecords satisfies any standard criterion for being random goes to one\nas the number of measurements gets large. This result holds for any\ncriterion of randomness that classifies at most a countable number of\n\\(\\omega\\)-length binary sequences as nonrandom.\n\nSee Hartle (1968), Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann (1989), Barrett\n(1999), and Barrett and Goldbring (2022) for proofs of the first\nlimiting result and the last two references for proofs of the\nsecond.\n\nIt is an immediate consequence that the records of a typical relative\nobserver, in the special measure \\(m\\) sense of typical, will exhibit\nthe standard quantum statistics as the number of measurements gets\nlarge. As Everett put it:\n\nIn the language of subjective experience, the observer which is\ndescribed by a typical element \u2026 of the superposition has perceived\nan apparently random sequence of definite results for the\nobservations.\u2026 It will thus appear to the observer which is\ndescribed by a typical element of the superposition that each initial\nobservation on a system caused the system to \u201cjump\u201c into\nan eigenstate in a random fashion and thereafter remain there for\nsubsequent measurements on the same system. Therefore, qualitatively,\nat least, the probabilistic assertions of Process 1 [the collapse of\nthe state under rule 4b] appear to be valid to the observer\ndescribed by a typical element of the final superposition. (1956, 123)\n\n\nMore generally, he concluded that \u201cthe memory sequence of a\ntypical element of [the superposition] has all the characteristics of\na random sequence, with individual, independent \u2026\nprobabilities\u201c (1956, 127). Hence, a typical sequence of\nrelative measurement records will exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics and thus appear to have been produced by Process 1 (rule\n4b). And that is Everett\u2019s full deduction of quantum\nprobabilities as subjective appearances to a typical relative\nobserver.\n\nEverett was careful to explain that the typicality measure over\nbranches involved no reference to probability (1956, 79). While he\nsometimes used the language of probability theory, he explained that\nthis was only for ease of exposition, and he repeatedly instructed the\nreader that all talk of probabilities should be translated back to\ntalk of typicalities (1956, 127 and 1957, 193). That he did not aim to\ndeduce probabilities over branches corresponding to alternative\nmeasurement outcomes is something that distinguishes Everett\u2019s\napproach from most other formulations of quantum mechanics, including\nthose of many Everettians.\n\nWhy showing that a typical sequence of relative measurement records\nwill exhibit the standard quantum statistics is supposed to be enough\nto explain our experience turns on Everett\u2019s understanding of\nempirical faithfulness.\n4. Empirical Faithfulness\n\nWhen the physicist Bryce DeWitt read Everett\u2019s description of\npure wave mechanics in the long version of his PhD thesis, DeWitt\nobjected on the grounds that the surplus structure of the theory made\nit too rich to represent the world we experience. In his 7 May 1957\nletter to Everett\u2019s advisor John Wheeler, DeWitt wrote\n\nI do agree that the scheme which Everett sets up is beautifully\nconsistent; that any single one of the [relative memory states of an\nobserver] \u2026 gives an excellent representation of a typical memory\nconfiguration, with no causal or logical contradictions, and with\n\u201cbuilt-in\u201d statistical features. The whole state vector\n\u2026, however, is simply too rich in content, by vast orders of\nmagnitude, to serve as a representation of the physical world. It\ncontains all possible branches in it at the same time. In the real\nphysical world we must be content with just one branch.\nEverett\u2019s world and the real physical world are therefore not\nisomorphic. (Barrett and Byrne 2012, 246\u20137)\n\n\nThe worry was that the richness of pure wave mechanics indicated an\nempirical flaw in the theory because we do not notice other branches.\nAs DeWitt put it:\n\nThe trajectory of the memory configuration of a real observer \u2026\ndoes not branch. I can testify to this from personal\nintrospection, as can you. I simply do not branch. (Barrett\nand Byrne 2012, 246)\n\n\nWheeler showed Everett the letter and told him to reply. In his 31 May\n1957 letter to DeWitt, Everett began by summarizing his understanding\nof the proper cognitive status of physical theories:\n\nFirst, I must say a few words to clarify my conception of the nature\nand purpose of physical theories in general. To me, any physical\ntheory is a logical construct (model), consisting of symbols and rules\nfor their manipulation, some of whose elements are\nassociated with elements of the perceived world. If this association\nis an isomorphism (or at least a homomorphism) we can speak of the\ntheory as correct, or as faithful. The fundamental\nrequirements of any theory are logical consistency and correctness in\nthis sense. Barrett and Byrne (2012, 253)\n\n\nIn a subsequent version of the long thesis, Everett further explained\nthat \u201c[t]he word homomorphism would be technically more\ncorrect, since there may not be a one-one correspondence between the\nmodel and the external world\u201d (1956, 169). The map is a\nhomomorphism because (1) there may be elements of the theory that do\nnot directly correspond to experience and because (2) a particular\ntheory may not seek to explain all of experience. As indicated by the\nitalicized some in the quotation above, the first point is\nparticularly important in the case of pure wave mechanics.\nSpecifically, that the relative records on the vast majority of\nbranches of the absolute state do not correspond with our\nexperience did not worry Everett at all, even when these records\nrepresent empirical structure.\n\nEverett further described how he understood the aim of physical\ninquiry in his letter to DeWitt, \u201cThere can be no question of\nwhich theory is \u2018true\u2019 or \u2018real\u2019 \u2014 the\nbest that one can do is reject those theories which are not\nisomorphic to sense experience\u201d Barrett and Byrne (2012, 253).\nIn all, Everett\u2019s position was in some ways strikingly similar\nto Bas van Fraassen\u2019s (1980) later constructive empiricism\nexcept that most of the empirical structure of pure wave mechanics is\nirrelevant to one\u2019s actual experience. See Barrett (2011a) for\nan extended discussion of Everett\u2019s notion of faithfulness.\n\nFor Everett, then, the relative-state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics is empirically faithful because there is a\nparticular sort of homomorphism between its model and the world as\nexperienced. Namely, it is because one can find a modeled\nobserver\u2019s experience in a typical relative sequence of\nher physical records. But the sense in which he finds finds an\nobserver\u2019s experience in his model of pure wave mechanics is\nsuch that it makes it difficult to judge the theory as empirically\nadequate over quantum probabilities. We will review four distinct\nfeatures of empirical faithfulness which Everett argued for then\nreturn to the question of empirical adequacy.\n5. Four Arguments for the Faithfulness of Pure Wave Mechanics\n\nThe relative state formulation of pure wave mechanics clearly\nsatisfies Everett\u2019s condition of logical consistency. There are\nfour lines of argument that explain why he also took it to be\nempirically faithful and hence empirically acceptable.\n5.1 Experience is found in the relative memory records of observers\n\nEverett held that one can find our actual experience in the model of\npure wave mechanics as relative measurement records associated with\nobservers modeled as ordinary physical systems. In the state\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) above, since \\(J\\) has a different relative\nmeasurement record in each branch and since these relative records\nspan the space of possible outcomes, regardless of what result is in\nfact experienced, one will be able to find that experience as a\nrelative record of the modeled observer in the post-measurement\nstate.\n\nFurther, if one performs a sequence of measurements, it follows from\nthe linearity of the dynamics and Everett\u2019s physical model of an\nobserver that every physically possible sequence of determinate\nmeasurement results will be represented in the entangled\npost-measurement state as a relative sequence of determinate\nmeasurement records. This is also true if one only relatively, rather\nthan absolutely, makes a sequence of observations. In this precise\nsense, then, it is possible to find our experience as sequences of\nrelative records in the model of pure wave mechanics.\n\nEverett took such relative records to be sufficient to explain the\nsubjective appearances of observers because, at least for an ideal\nmeasurement, every post-measurement relative state will be one where\nthe observer in fact has, and, as we will see in the next section,\nwould report that she has, a fully determinate, repeatable measurement\nrecord that agrees with the records of other ideal observers. As he\nexplained the point, the system states observed by a relative observer\nare typically eigenstates of the observable being measured (1957,\n188). For further discussion of this point see Everett (1956,\n129\u201330), (1955, 67), (1956 121\u20133 and 130\u20133), and\n(1957, 186\u20138 and 194\u20135).\n\nNote that he did not require a physically preferred basis to show that\npure wave mechanics was empirically faithful. The principle of the\nfundamental relatively of states explicitly allows for arbitrarily\nspecified decompositions of the absolute universal state into relative\nstates. Given his understanding of empirical faithfulness, all he\nneeded to explain a particular actual record was to show that is that\nthere is some decomposition of the state that represents the\nmodeled observer with the corresponding relative record. It is there\nthat he finds the records corresponding to an observer\u2019s\nexperience in his model.\n5.2 Pure wave mechanics predicts that one would not ordinarily notice that there are alternative relative records\n\nEverett believed that he could also explain why the surplus empirical\nstructure of pure wave mechanics would go unnoticed. In his reply to\nDeWitt, he claimed that pure wave mechanics \u201cis in full accord\nwith our experience (at least insofar as ordinary quantum mechanics\nis) \u2026 just because it is possible to show that no\nobserver would ever be aware of any \u2018branching,\u2019 which is\nalien to our experience as you point out\u201d Barrett and Byrne\n(2012, 254).\n\nThere are two arguments that Everett may have had in mind.\n\nThe first is not one that Everett highlighted, but he clearly\nrecognized the point. One would only notice macroscopic splitting if\none had access to records of macroscopic splitting events.\nSpecifically, one would need to show that there are branches where\none\u2019s macroscopic measurement devices have different macroscopic\nmeasurement records for the same measurement. This would require one\nto perform something akin to a Wigner\u2019s Friend interference\nmeasurement on a macroscopic system in an entangled superposition of\nrecord states that shows that it is. But as Everett indicated in his\ncharacterization of his Wigner Friend drama as \u201cextremely\nhypothetical,\u201d such an experiment would be extraordinarily\ndifficult. The upshot is that, while not impossible, one should not\nexpect to find reliable interference records indicating that there are\nbranches corresponding to alternative macroscopic measurement\nrecords.\n\nThe second is a point to which Everett repeatedly returned in his\ndeductions of the subjective experience of modeled observers in both\nthe long and short thesis. Namely, it follows directly from the linear\ndynamics that it would appear to an ideal agent that she had\nfully determinate measurement results. Albert and Loewer (1988)\npresented a dispositional version of this line of argument in their\npresentation of the bare theory, a version of pure wave mechanics, as\na way of understanding Everett\u2019s formulation of quantum\nmechanics.\n\nThe idea is that if there is no collapse of the quantum-mechanical\nstate, an ideal modeled observer like \\(J\\) would have the sure-fire\ndisposition falsely to report and hence to believe that she\nhad a perfectly ordinary, fully sharp and determinate measurement\nrecord. The trick is to consider not what result the observer got, but\nrather whether she believes that she got some specific\ndeterminate result. If the post-measurement state was:\n\n\\[\n|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S\n\\]\n\n\nthen \\(J\\) would report \u201cI got a determinate result, either spin\nup or spin down\u201d and presumably so believe. And she would make\nprecisely the same report and believe that she got a determinate\nresult if she ended up in the post-measurement state: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\nSo, by the linearity of the dynamics, \\(J\\) would falsely\nreport \u201cI got a determinate result, either spin up or spin\ndown\u201d and believe that she got a determinate result when in\npost-measurement state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\): \n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J\n|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\n\\]\n\n\nThus, insofar as her beliefs agree with her sure-fire dispositions to\nreport that she got a fully determinate result, it would seem to \\(J\\)\nthat she got a perfectly determinate ordinary measurement result even\nwhen she did not. That is, she does not determinately believe that she\ngot \u201cspin up\u201d, and she does not determinately believe that\nshe got \u201cspin down\u201d, but she does determinately believe\nthat she got \u201ceither spin up or spin down.\u201d\n\nSo, while which result \\(J\\) got in state \\(\\boldsymbol{e}\\)\nis a relative fact, that it would appear to \\(J\\) that she got\nsome determinate result is an absolute fact. See Everett\n(1956, 129\u201330), (1955, 67), (1956, 121\u20133 and 130\u20133),\nand (1957, 186\u20138 and 194\u20135), Albert and Loewer (1988),\nAlbert (1992), and Barrett (1999) and (2020) for further details. We\nwill return to a discussion of the bare theory later in this article\nand consider that theory on its own terms. For present purposes, the\ndeterminate result property illustrates why an observer would not\nreport or notice that she had branched.\n5.3 The surplus structure of pure wave mechanics is in principle detectable and hence isn\u2019t surplus structure at all\n\nEverett insisted that alternative relative states, even relative\nstates of macroscopically distinct records, were always at least in\nprinciple detectable by means of something like the Wigner\u2019s\nFriend \\(A\\)-measurement discussed above. This was Everett\u2019s\npoint in insisting that \u201cdue to the ever present possibility of\nobtaining interference effects between the elements, all elements of a\nsuperposition must be regarded as simultaneously existing\u201d\n(1956, 150). So while extremely difficult to detect, alternative\nrelative records are all equally real since the linear dynamics\nrequires that it be always in principle possible to measure an\nobservable that would detect other branches. And since they are in\nprinciple detectable, they do not represent surplus structure.\n\nNote that this does not mean that only the branches in a single\nphysically preferred basis are real. It means that every branch in\nevery decomposition of a the state of a system is real in precisely\nthe same sense as its presence entails in principle observational\nconsequences. That Everett considered alternative branches of the\nuniversal wave function to be always in principle detectable\nrepresents a significant difference between his formulation of quantum\nmechanics and a many-worlds theory where worlds are supposed to be\ncausally isolated.\n5.4 A typical relative sequence of measurement records exhibits the standard quantum statistics\n\nEverett did not solve the probability problem by finding probabilities\nin pure wave mechanics. Rather, he repeatedly insisted that there were\nno probabilities and took this to be an essential feature of the\ntheory. What he did, rather, was to show that a typical relative\nsequence of a modeled observer\u2019s measurement records will\nexhibit the standard quantum statistics.\n\nAs we saw above, Everett got this result in two steps. First, he found\na suitable measure of typicality over relative states \\(m\\) whose\nvalue is fully determined by the model of pure wave mechanics. Then he\nshowed that, in the limit as the number of measurement interactions\ngets large, almost all relative sequences of measurement records, in\nthe sense of almost all given by \\(m\\), will exhibit the\nstandard quantum statistics. While the typicality measure \\(m\\) is\nacross branches, he explained the subjective appearance of\nquantum probabilities by the sequence of records within a typical\nbranch.\n\nEverett summarized his strategy and main result to a group a\nphysicists at a conference on the foundations of quantum mechanics at\nXavier University in October of 1962:\n\nNow, I would like to assert that, for a \u201ctypical\u201d branch,\nthe frequency of results will be precisely what is predicted by\nordinary quantum mechanics. Even more strongly, I would like to assert\nthat, as the number of observations goes to infinity, almost all\nbranches will contain frequencies of results in accord with ordinary\nquantum theory predictions. To be able to make a statement like this\nrequires that there be some sort of a measure on the superposition of\nstates. What I need, therefore, is a measure that I can put on a sum\nof orthogonal states. There is one consistency [criterion] which would\nbe required for such a thing. Since my states are constantly\nbranching, I must insist that the measure on a state originally is\nequal to the sum of the measures on the separate branches after a\nbranching process. Now this consistency criterion can be shown to lead\ndirectly to the squared amplitude of the coefficient, as the unique\nmeasure which satisfies this. With this unique measure, deduced only\nfrom a consistency condition, I can then assert: indeed, for almost\nall (in the measure theoretical sense) elements of a very large\nsuperposition, the predictions of ordinary quantum mechanics hold.\n(Barrett and Byrne 2012, 274\u201375)\n\n\nImportantly, it is usually not the case that most relative sequences\nby count will exhibit the standard quantum statistics. This\nis why the norm squared coefficient measure \\(m\\) is essential to\nEverett\u2019s account.\n\nRegarding Everett\u2019s summary of his project, there are two\nclosely related points worth noting. First, his sub-branch additivity\ncondition is not required for simple consistency. This can be seen by\nthe fact that a proportional counting measure over descendent branches\nwould have been perfectly consistent. It just wouldn\u2019t have\nentailed that a typical branch will exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics. Second, as he acknowledged in this thesis, he needed more\nthan just sub-branch additivity to get the squared amplitude measure\n\\(m\\). He also needed \\(m\\) to be a positive linear function of the\ncomplex-valued coefficients associated with each branch, and he needed\nto suppose that \\(m\\) satisfied the standard axioms for being a\nprobability measure. See Everett (1956, 120\u201330) and (1957,\n186\u201394) and Barrett (2017) and (2020) for discussions of\ntypicality and quantum statistics in pure wave mechanics.\n\nIt is an immediate consequence of Everett\u2019s deduction that that\nif one were to further assume that one should expect one\u2019s\nrecords to be typical in the sense provided by measure \\(m\\), then one\nshould expect one\u2019s records to exhibit the standard quantum\nstatistics. Were such an assumption added to his formulation of pure\nwave mechanics, something that Everett himself never proposed, then\none would be able to explain why one should expect to find\noneself at each time with records that appear to have been generated\nby a random process like rule 4b. But one cannot get even this, let\nalone standard forward-looking quantum probabilities, without\nsupplementing pure wave mechanics with auxiliary assumptions that tie\nthe measure \\(m\\) to one\u2019s probabilistic expectations. Such\nauxiliary assumptions would clearly represent significant additions to\npure wave mechanics.\n\nFor his part, Everett just argued that the sequence of records in a\ntypical branch, in his specified sense of typical, would satisfy the\nstandard quantum statistics. And it was this that he took to establish\nthat his relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics was\nempirically faithful and hence empirically acceptable.\n6. Empirical Faithfulness and Empirical Adequacy\n\nEverett took pure wave mechanics to empirically faithful because (1)\none can find an observer\u2019s experience in the relative records of\nthe observer as modeled in the theory and (2) pure wave mechanics\nprovides something that one can take as a typicality measure over\nrelative states such that a typical relative sequence of measurement\nrecords in that measure will exhibit the standard quantum statistics.\nThe first is Everett\u2019s resolution of the determinate record\nproblem, and the second is his resolution of the probability problem.\nThat said, one might want more than empirical faithfulness from a\nsatisfactory formulation of quantum mechanics.\n\nThat empirical faithfulness is a weak standard of empirical adequacy\nis illustrated in what Everett\u2019s formulation of pure wave\nmechanics does not explain about our experience. It does not explain\nwhat it is about the physical world that makes it appropriate to\nexpect one\u2019s relative sequence of records to be typical\nin the norm-squared-coefficient sense, or in any other sense, at a\ntime. Nor does it explain why one should expect alternative\nfuture measurement results with the standard quantum\nprobabilities. The lack of both synchronic and forward-looking\nprobabilities means that Everett did not deduce the probabilistic\npredictions of rule 4b as subjective appearances to his modeled\nobservers. It also illustrates the need for relatively strong\nauxiliary assumptions in order to derive anything like the standard\nquantum predictions from pure wave mechanics.\n\nThe upshot is that while the relative state formulation of pure wave\nmechanics is logically consistent and empirically faithful in a sense\nthat Everett thought sufficient, it does not make the standard\nprobabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics for even simple\nexperiments and, hence, fails to be empirically adequate in any\nstandard sense. There is a long tradition of supplementing pure wave\nmechanics with yet stronger auxiliary assumptions in order to get a\ntheory that one might take to be straightforwardly empirically\nadequate. This is the aim of the various many-worlds reconstructions\nof Everett\u2019s relative state formulation.\n7. Many Worlds\n\nWhile he was initially skeptical of Everett\u2019s project, DeWitt\nbecame an ardent proponent of the many-worlds interpretation, a theory\nthat DeWitt presented as the EWG interpretation of quantum mechanics\n(named after Everett, Wheeler, and DeWitt\u2019s graduate student R.\nNeill Graham). In his description of the many-worlds interpretation,\nDeWitt (1970) emphasized that its central feature was the metaphysical\ncommitment to physically splitting worlds. DeWitt\u2019s description\nsubsequently became the most popular understanding of Everett\u2019s\ntheory. See Barrett (2011b) for a discussion of Everett\u2019s\nhistorical attitude toward DeWitt and the many-worlds interpretation.\nSee Lewis (2016), Saunders, Barrett, Kent, and Wallace (eds) (2010),\nVaidman (2012), Wallace (2010a) (2010b) (2012), Sebens (2015), Sebens\nand Carroll (2018), and the entry\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics\n for discussions of a number of quite different many-worlds\ninterpretations.\n\nDeWitt described his theory in the context of the\nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat thought experiment.\n\nThe animal [is] trapped in a room together with a Geiger counter and a\nhammer, which, upon discharge of the counter, smashes a flask of\nprussic acid. The counter contains a trace of radioactive\nmaterial\u2014just enough that in one hour there is a 50% chance one\nof the nuclei will decay and therefore an equal chance the cat will be\npoisoned. At the end of the hour the total wave function for the\nsystem will have a form in which the living cat and the dead cat are\nmixed in equal portions. Schr\u00f6dinger felt that the wave mechanics\nthat led to this paradox presented an unacceptable description of\nreality. However, Everett, Wheeler and Graham\u2019s interpretation\nof quantum mechanics pictures the cats as inhabiting two simultaneous,\nnoninteracting, but equally real worlds. (1970, 31)\n\n\nDeWitt took this view to follow from \u201cthe mathematical formalism\nof quantum mechanics as it stands without adding anything to\nit.\u201d More specifically, he claimed that EWG had proven a\nmetatheorem that the mathematical formalism of pure wave mechanics\ninterprets itself:\n\nWithout drawing on any external metaphysics or mathematics other than\nthe standard rules of logic, EWG are able, from these postulates, to\nprove the following metatheorem: The mathematical formalism of the\nquantum theory is capable of yielding its own interpretation. (1970,\n33)\n\n\nHe gave Everett credit for the metatheorem, Wheeler credit for\nencouraging Everett, and Graham credit for clarifying the metatheorem.\nDeWitt and Graham later described Everett\u2019s formulation of\nquantum mechanics as follows:\n\n[It] denies the existence of a separate classical realm and asserts\nthat it makes sense to talk about a state vector for the whole\nuniverse. This state vector never collapses and hence reality as a\nwhole is rigorously deterministic. This reality, which is described\njointly by the dynamical variables and the state vector, is\nnot the reality we customarily think of, but is a reality composed of\nmany worlds. By virtue of the temporal development of the dynamical\nvariables the state vector decomposes naturally into orthogonal\nvectors, reflecting a continual splitting of the universe into a\nmultitude of mutually unobservable but equally real worlds, in each of\nwhich every good measurement has yielded a definite result and in most\nof which the familiar statistical quantum laws hold (1973, v).\n\n\nThe metaphysics of splitting worlds immediately addresses the\ndeterminate result problem. As DeWitt notes, after an observer makes a\nmeasurement, each resultant copy of the observer will inhabit a\nphysical world described by a branch of the global state and endowed\nwith with a fully determinate physical record. But inasmuch as the\npre-measurement observer can expect to find herself in each\npost-measurement world, there remains a problem accounting for the\nstandard quantum probabilities. It appears that the forward-looking\nprobability of each possible measurement result is precisely one. We\nwill return to this issue in a moment.\n\nThere is a conceptual cost in getting determinate measurement records\nby stipulating splitting worlds. DeWitt conceded that he had found the\nconstant splitting of worlds whenever the states of systems become\ncorrelated to be strongly counterintuitive:\n\nI still recall vividly the shock I experienced on first encountering\nthis multiworld concept. The idea of \\(10^{100}\\) slightly imperfect\ncopies of oneself all constantly splitting into further copies, which\nultimately become unrecognizable, is not easy to reconcile with common\nsense. Here is schizophrenia with a vengeance (1973, 161).\n\n\nThat said, DeWitt promoted the theory at every turn, and\nEverett\u2019s views quickly came to be identified with DeWitt and\nGraham\u2019s many-worlds interpretation. It is instructive to\nconsider how DeWitt\u2019s views differ from Everett\u2019s.\n\nTo begin, since purely mathematical postulates entail only purely\nmathematical theorems, one cannot deduce any metaphysical commitments\nwhatsoever regarding the physical world from the mathematical\nformalism of pure wave mechanics alone. The formalism of pure wave\nmechanics might entail the sort of commitments that DeWitt envisioned\nbut only if supplemented with sufficiently strong auxiliary\nassumptions. For his part, Everett seems to have clearly understood\nthis this point. Concerning DeWitt\u2019s claim that pure wave\nmechanics somehow interprets itself by way of a metatheorem that\nEverett proved, there is nothing answering to DeWitt\u2019s\ndescription of this metatheorem in either Everett\u2019s long or\nshort thesis.\n\nFurther, contrary to what DeWitt, Graham, and others have supposed,\nEverett was never committed to \u201cmutually unobservable\nworlds.\u201d In contrast, as we have seen, Everett held that it is\nalways in principle possible for branches to interact. In this regard,\nhe argued that \u201cno matter what the state of [the observer in\nEverett\u2019s version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend story] is, there\nis in principle a complete set of commuting operators for which it is\nan eigenstate, so that, at least, the determination of these\nquantities will not affect the state nor in any way.\u201d He also\ndenied that there are fundamental restrictions about the\n\u201cknowability of any state functions.\u201d And he\nbelieved that the sense in which all branches of the global state are\nequally actual is given by the ever present possibility of interaction\nbetween branches.\n\nIn identifying Everett\u2019s theory with Graham\u2019s many-world\nreconstruction there is good reason to believe that DeWitt simply\nfailed to understand Everett. We know what Everett thought of DeWitt\nand Graham\u2019s formulation of the theory. In his personal copy of\nDeWitt\u2019s description of the many-worlds interpretation, Everett\nwrote the word \u201cbullshit\u201d next to the passage where DeWitt\npresented Graham\u2019s discussion of the branching process and\nEverett\u2019s typicality measure. See Barrett and Byrne 2012,\n364\u20136 for scans of Everett\u2019s handwritten marginal\nnotes.\n\nFinally, Everett carefully avoided the metaphysical talk of worlds.\nRather, his understanding of the reality of branches was operational.\nFor Everett there was no canonical basis. Given how he understood\nbranches and their role in determining the empirical faithfulness of\nthe theory, he had no need of a physically preferred basis. He\nbelieved that it was sufficient if one could find our experience in a\nmodeled observer\u2019s typical relative records. In contrast, DeWitt\nseems to have had in mind a canonically preferred basis that would\ndetermine what worlds there are and their state.\n\nWhile Everett himself did not do so, one might designate a special set\nof branches of the global absolute state to represent worlds, or\nemergent worlds, or approximate emergent worlds. But there are many\nways one might do this, and how one understands such worlds cannot be\ndetermined solely by the mathematical formalism of pure wave mechanics\nalone. Easily the most popular sort of many-worlds theory at present\ncharacterizes approximate emergent worlds in terms of decoherence\nconditions.\n\nIn contrast with DeWitt, who appears to have taken worlds to be basic\nentities described by the global absolute state, David Wallace (2002,\n2010a, 2010b, and 2012) takes the global quantum state as basic, then\nseeks to characterize worlds as emergent entities represented in its\nstructure. The analogy he gives is that pure wave mechanics describes\nthe quantum state just as classical field theory describes physical\nfields (2010a, 69). Worlds are understood as physically real but\ncontingently emergent entities that are identified with approximate\nsubstructures of the quantum state, or as Wallace puts it,\n\u201cmutually dynamically isolated structures instantiated within\nthe quantum state, which are structurally and dynamically\n\u2018quasiclassical\u2019\u201d (2010a, 70). Since the fundamental\ntheory is supposed to be pure wave mechanics, such emergent worlds\nwill be more or less well-defined and more and less well-isolated on\nthe linear dynamics depending on details of the physical situation and\nthe level of description one considers.\n\nOn Wallace\u2019s account, there is no simple matter of fact\nconcerning what, or even how many, emergent worlds there are. Such\nquestions depend on one\u2019s level of description and on how\nwell-isolated one requires worlds to be for the explanatory\nconsiderations at hand. That said, the decohering worlds approach\nprovides something that is characterized by the evolution of\nthe global state on which alternative measurement records might\nsupervene. In this case, one need not stipulate a physically preferred\nbasis as it is decoherence conditions that individuate alternative\nquasi-determinate worlds at a given level of description. One gets a\ndeterminate measurement result because, at a level of description\nappropriate for characterizing the properties of macroscopic systems,\none in fact inhabits an emergent world containing a determinate\nrecord.\n\nThere remains, however, the problem of accounting for standard quantum\nprobabilities. Taking the decision-theoretic approach of David Deutsch\n(1997, 1999) as a starting point, Wallace (2010b) proves a\nrepresentation theorem from ten constraints on the preferences of a\nrational agent in the context of a world described by pure wave\nmechanics. If an agent acts as required by these constraints, she will\nact as if she expects future events with the standard quantum\nprobabilities. Wallace understands these constraints as basic\nprinciples of reason, but inasmuch as they only make sense in the\ncontext of pure wave mechanics, they are perhaps best understood as\nauxiliary assumptions that, in conjunction with pure wave mechanics,\nexplain why an agent might act as if the standard quantum\nprobabilities held when in fact every physically possible outcome of\nher actions is fully realized. There is, of course, nothing wrong with\nsupplementing pure wave mechanics with whatever auxiliary assumptions\none needs to derive a suitable version of the standard quantum\nprobabilities. See Wallace (2003, 2006, 2007, 2010b, and 2012) and\nGreaves (2006) for further discussions of quantum probabilities and\nepistemology on a decision-theoretic approach to pure wave\nmechanics.\n\nGranting such auxiliary assumptions, making sense of standard forward\nlooking quantum probabilities requires further care. Before making an\nobservation, an observer knows that every physically possible\nmeasurement result will certainly occur. One wants to say that she\nwill expect to find herself in each resulting world with the standard\nquantum probabilities after the measurement interaction, but if there\nis just one pre-measurement observer, then inasmuch as she gets any\nresult at all, she will get every possible result. One way around this\nis to suppose that for every post-measurement observer there is\nalready a corresponding pre-measurement observer. Each of these\npre-measurement observers is unsure which post-measurement observer is\nher future self. Forward looking quantum probabilities represent this\nepistemic uncertainty. On this strategy, then, one seeks to add\nauxiliary assumptions to pure wave mechanics sufficient to provide\nstandard forward-looking quantum probabilities as epistemic\nself-location probabilities concerning which full history\ncharacterizes one\u2019s experience. If one is successful, the\nresultant theory might be taken to be empirically adequate in a\nperfectly ordinary sense. Saunders and Wallace\u2019s (2008a, 2008b)\ndivergent worlds account and Barrett\u2019s (1999) many-threads\ntheory seek to exploit this strategy. See Lewis (2016) for a critical\nexamination of the divergent worlds approach to forward looking\nprobabilities. See Saunders, Barrett, Kent, and Wallace (2010) and the\nentry on the\n many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics\n for other approaches to getting synchronic and, in some cases,\nforward-looking self-location probabilities.\n8. The Bare Theory and Extensions\n8.1 The Bare Theory\n\nThe bare theory is pure wave mechanics with the standard\ninterpretation of states (rule 3). This approach takes seriously\nEverett\u2019s proposal of simply dropping the collapse dynamics\n(rule 4b) from the standard theory then try to derive the standard\ntheory\u2019s predictions as subjective experiences from the\nresulting theory. Inasmuch as the bare theory is arguably identical to\npure wave mechanics, studying it is a good way to assess the virtues\nand vices of Everett\u2019s proposal. It is also a good first step in\nfiguring out what auxiliary assumptions are needed in order to get a\nstraightforward account of determinate records and forward-looking\nquantum probabilities starting from pure wave mechanics. See Albert\nand Loewer (1988), Albert (1992), and Barrett (1994) for a description\nof the bare theory and Geroch (1984) for a similar reading of\nEverett.\n\nOn the bare theory there is no distinction between absolute and\nrelative states nor is there any special notion of typicality. Rather,\none uses Everett\u2019s model of an idealized observer to argue that\nit would appear to such observers that they had the perfectly\ndeterminate measurement outcomes predicted by the collapse dynamics\nwhen they in fact did not. The thought is that this is one way of\ncapturing Everett\u2019s goal of deducing the standard predictions of\nquantum mechanics as the subjective appearances of observers who are\nthemselves treated within the theory. We have already seen the basic\nargument in section 5.2. We will start by briefly reviewing how it\ngoes in a slightly more general setup.\n\nSince \\(J\\) would report that she had a determinate result in\npost-measurement state: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\nand would report that she had a determinate result in post-measurement\nstate: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\n\\(J\\) would, by the linearity of the dynamics, also report that she\ngot a perfectly determinate result, either spin up or spin down, in\nthe post-measurement state \\(J\\) gets when observing \\(S\\) in\nstate \n\\[\n\\alpha|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + \\beta|\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S.\\]\n\n\nAssuming that she perfectly correlates her record with the \\(x\\)-spin\nof \\(S\\) in a way that does not disturb its spin, then on the linear\ndynamics (rule 4a), the resultant post-measurement state in this case\nis \n\\[\\alpha|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S + \\beta|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S.\\]\n\n\nIf asked in this state \\(J\\) would be in a superposition of reporting\n\u201cI got a determinate result, either spin up or spin down\u201d\nin the first branch and reporting \u201cI got a determinate result,\neither spin up or spin down\u201d in the second branch, which is an\neigenstate of reporting \u201cI got a determinate result, either spin\nup or spin down.\u201d Hence, if we assume that her reports are in\nfact true of her experience, it would appear to \\(J\\) that\nshe got a perfectly determinate ordinary measurement result even when\nshe did not determinately get \u201cspin up\u201d and she did not\ndeterminately get \u201cspin down\u201d. One might think of this as\na disjunctive experience. The disjunctive experience is not\nan experience of either ordinary determinate result, but it is one\nwhere the observer is convinced that her result is\n\u201cdeterminately spin up or determinately spin\ndown\u201d.\n\nOne can similarly argue from the linear dynamics and the properties of\nan ideal observer that if \\(J\\) repeats her spin measurement, then she\nwill end up with the sure-fire disposition to report that she got the\nsame result for the second measurement as for the first, even when she\ndid not in fact get an ordinary determinate result for either. As a\nresult, it will appear to her that there has been a collapse of the\nquantum-mechanical state when in fact there has been no collapse,\nsplitting of worlds, or anything else that would produce an ordinary\ndeterminate measurement record. The subjective appearance of a\ncollapse here is an illusion produced by the linear dynamics. It\nrepresents her inability to distinguish between ordinary and\ndisjunctive experience.\n\nThe linear dynamics also entails intersubjective agreement between\ndifferent observers. If a second observer were to check \\(J\\)\u2019s\nmeasurement result, the second observer would end up believing that\nhis result agreed with her result, even when neither observer in fact\nhas an ordinary determinate measurement record. In this sense, there\nis subjective agreement on the apparent result of the apparent\ncollapse.\n\nFinally, one can show that an observer who repeats a measurement on an\ninfinite sequence of systems in the same initial state will approach a\nstate where she has the sure-fire dispositions to report that her\nmeasurement results were randomly distributed with the standard\nquantum statistics, even when she in fact got no ordinary results for\nany of her measurements. This follows from the relative frequency and\nrandomness results in section 3.2. Hence she will end up believing\nthat she got a determinate measurement result to each measurement and\nthat these results were distributed precisely as one would expect on\nthe standard collapse dynamics. See Everett (1956, 129\u201330),\n(1955, 67), (1956, 121\u20133 and 130\u20133), and (1957,\n186\u20138 and 194\u20135) for his discussions of these formal\nproperties of pure wave mechanics.\n\nWhile the bare theory has a number of suggestive properties, there are\nat least two serious problems. To begin, it is not empirically\ncoherent. If the bare theory were true, it would be impossible to have\nempirical evidence for accepting it as true given the radical sort of\nillusions it predicts. See Barrett (1996) for a discussion of\nempirical coherence in the context of the bare theory and John\nBell\u2019s (1981, 133\u20137) Everett (?) theory. Another is that\nif the bare theory were true, one would most likely fail to have any\ndeterminate beliefs at all since, on the linear dynamics, one would\nexpect the global state to almost never be an eigenstate of any\nparticular observer being sentient or even existing. For a further\ndiscussion of how experience is supposed to work in the bare theory\nand some the problems it encounters see Albert (1992), Bub, Clifton,\nand Monton, (1998), and Barrett (1999 and 2020).\n8.2 Many Minds and Hidden Variables\n\nEverett held that on his formulation of quantum mechanics \u201cthe\nformal theory is objectively continuous and causal, while subjectively\ndiscontinuous and probabilistic\u201d (1956, 77). Albert and Loewer\n(1988) aimed to capture this feature in their many-minds theory. In\ndoing so, they show one way that one might add auxiliary assumptions\nto pure wave mechanics that yield both determinate records and\nstandard forward-looking quantum probabilities.\n\nThe many-minds theory distinguishes between an observer\u2019s\nphysical state and her mental state. Her physical\nstate is given by pure wave mechanics, and associated with her\nphysical state is a continuously infinite set of minds. The\nobserver\u2019s physical state, like all other physical systems,\nalways evolves in the usual deterministic way according to rule 4a,\nbut each mind associated with the observer jumps randomly to a mental\nstate corresponding to one of the Everett branches that is produced in\neach measurement-like interaction. The probability that a particular\nmind will experience a given Everett branch is equal to the norm\nsquared of the amplitude associated with that branch.\n\nOn this dynamics, then, if a measurement interaction between \\(J\\) and\n\\(S\\) produces post-measurement state \n\\[\\alpha|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S + \\beta|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S,\\]\n\n\nthen one should expect \\(|\\alpha|^2\\)proportion of \\(J\\)\u2019s minds\nto end up associated with the result \u201cspin up\u201d (the first\nterm of the expression) and \\(|\\beta|^2\\)proportion of \\(J\\)\u2019s\nminds to end up associated with the result \u201cspin down\u201d\n(the second term of the expression). We will also suppose that the\nmental dynamics is memory-preserving so that once a mind is associated\nwith a particular branch it remains associated with the descendants of\nthat branch. See Barrett 1995 for a discussion of the dynamics.\n\nWhile the many-minds theory involves a strong mind-body dualism, it\nhas several salient virtues. First, there is no need for a physically\npreferred basis. One must choose a preferred basis in order to specify\nthe mental dynamics completely but this choice has nothing to do with\nphysical facts. Rather, it is just characterizes how mental states\nsupervene on physical states. Second, the determinate result problem\nis immediately solved since each mind always has a fully determinate\nset of measurement records. Third, the probability problem is\naddressed by how mental states evolve. Unlike many-worlds theories\nwhere an observer is copied into each post-measurement world, one gets\nthe standard forward-looking quantum probabilities here as predictions\nfor the future experiences of a particular mind. Finally, the\nmany-minds theory is one of the few formulations of quantum mechanics\nthat is (with decohering worlds and GRWf) arguably compatible with the\nconstraints of special relativity. See Hemmo and Pitowsky (2003) and\nBarrett (2020) for discussions.\n\nThe many-minds formulation of quantum mechanics can be thought of as a\nhidden-variable theory much like Bohmian mechanics. See below and the\nentry on\n Bohmian mechanics.\n But here, instead of making particle positions determinate and then\nassuming that determinate particle will provide observers with\ndeterminate measurement records, one simply stipulates that the mental\nstates of the observers are always determinate. While this strategy is\nclearly ad hoc, it is also effective. It immediately provides\nobservers with fully determinate measurement records, and with a\nsuitable stochastic dynamics, it yields the standard forward-looking\nquantum probabilities.\n\nThe many-minds formulation also illustrates the close relationship\nbetween pure wave mechanics and no-collapse hidden-variable theories.\nOne way to get ordinary determinate measurement outcomes and forward\nlooking probabilities is to add a parameter to pure wave mechanics\nthat represents the observer\u2019s records then to give a suitable\ndynamics for that parameter. We will consider another way this might\nwork in the next section.\n8.3 Many Histories and Bohmian Mechanics\n\nOn the standard sort of many-worlds theory, worlds are taken to split\nover time as new branches are produced in measurement-like\ninteractions. As we have seen, inasmuch as each possible measurement\noutcome is in fact recorded by some future copy of the\nobserver one of the post-measurement branches, one problem with this\nis that the forward-looking probability of an observer getting each\nquantum-mechanically possible outcome for a measurement is simply one.\nOne way to get the right forward-looking probabilities, the standard\nprobabilistic predictions of quantum mechanics, is to postulate worlds\nare characterized by complete histories and never branch. If one\ninhabits such a world, then one simply experiences its history.\n\nThe idea is closely related to many-history tradition. Gell-Mann and\nHartle (1990) characterized Everett\u2019s theory as one that\ndescribes many, mutually decohering, histories. On this sort of\ntheory, one might think of each physically possible trajectory through\nthe Everett branches as a thread that defines a world. See Dowker and\nKent (1996) for critical examination of the consistent histories\napproach and Barrett (1999) for a characterization of such\n\u201cmany-threads\u201d theories as a type of hidden-variable\ntheory.\n\nOne can see how a many-threads theory might provide ordinary\nforward-looking probabilities by considering how one might construct\nsuch a theory from the many-minds theory. For each full trajectory\nthat a particular mind might take through the Everett branches,\nassociate a single, non-splitting world that implements the events\nexperienced along that trajectory. What the mind would see, then, is\nwhat in fact happens in the corresponding world. In this way each mind\ndetermines the history of a non-branching world.\n\nNow consider the probability measure over the set of all such worlds\ndetermined by the many-minds probability associated with each full\nhistory. A many-threads theory would stipulate this measure as the\nprior epistemic probability of each possible non-branching world in\nfact being ours. These prior probabilities are then updated as we\nlearn more about the actual history of the world we inhabit. Since\nsuch worlds and everything in them have perfectly ordinary\ntrans-temporal identities, there is no problem accounting for\nforward-looking probabilities. The forward-looking probability for a\nfuture event is just the epistemic probability that the event in fact\noccurs in the world we inhabit.\n\nA no-collapse hidden-variable theory like Bohmian mechanics can also\nbe thought of as a many-threads theory. The close relationship between\nsuch hidden variable theories and this sort of many-world theory is\ninstructive.\n\nOn Bohmian mechanics the wave function always evolves in the usual\ndeterministic way, but particles are taken to always have fully\ndeterminate positions. For an \\(N\\)-particle system, the particle\nconfiguration can be thought of as being pushed around in\n\\(3N\\)-dimensional configuration space by the flow by the probability\nassociated with the wave function just as a massless particle would be\npushed around by a compressible fluid. Here both the evolution of the\nwave function and the evolution of the particle configuration are\nfully deterministic. Quantum probabilities are the result of the\ndistribution postulate. The distribution postulate sets the initial\nprior probability distribution equal to the norm squared of the wave\nfunction for an initial time. One learns what the new effective wave\nfunction is from one\u2019s measurement results, but one never knows\nmore than what is allowed by the standard quantum statistics. Indeed,\nBohm\u2019s theory always predicts the standard quantum probabilities\nfor particle configurations, but it predicts these as epistemic\nprobabilities. Bohm\u2019s theory is supposed to give determinate\nmeasurement results in terms of determinate particle configurations\n(say the position of the pointer on a measuring device). See the entry\non\n Bohmian mechanics\n and Barrett (2020) for further details.\n\nIf one chooses configuration as the preferred physical observable and\nadopts the particle dynamics of Bohm\u2019s theory, then one can\nconstruct a many-threads theory by fixing the initial wave function\nand the Hamiltonian and then considering every possible initial\nconfiguration of particles to correspond to a different full history\nfor a possible world. Here the prior probabilities are given by the\ndistribution postulate in Bohm\u2019s theory, and the updated\nepistemic probabilities yield the effective Bohmian wave function. On\nthis view, the only difference between Bohm\u2019s theory and the\nassociated many-threads theory is that the many-threads theory treats\nall possible Bohmian worlds as actual and quantum probabilities as\nepistemic self-location probabilities over these worlds. A\nmany-threads theory might be constructed for virtually any determinate\nphysical quantity just as one would construct a hidden-variable or a\nmodal theory. See the entry on entries on\n Bohmian mechanics\n and\n modal interpretations of quantum mechanics\n and Vink (1993).\n\nThe upshot is that if one takes the account of determinate records and\nquantum probabilities in pure wave mechanics alone to be inadequate,\nadding hidden variables provides a sure-fire way to get ordinary\nrecords and forward-looking probabilities. That said, there is good\nhistorical reason to suppose that Everett did not have a\nhidden-variable theory in mind.\n\nEverett explicitly discussed Bohmian mechanics in two places in his\nlong thesis (1956, 75, 153\u20135). His complaint was that\nBohm\u2019s theory was \u201cmore cumbersome than the conceptually\nsimpler theory based on pure wave mechanics.\u201d Even so, he took\nBohmian mechanics to be of \u201cgreat theoretical importance\u201d\nbecause it \u201cshowed that \u2018hidden variable\u2019 theories\nare indeed possible\u201d contrary to received wisdom. Concerning\nhidden-variable theories like Bohm\u2019s, Everett further\nacknowledged that \u201c[i]t cannot be disputed that these theories\nare often appealing and might conceivably become important should\nfuture discoveries indicate serious inadequacies in the present scheme\n[pure wave mechanics] (i.e. they might be more easily modified to\nencompass new experience)\u201d (1956, 155). While Everett thought\nthat he could adequately explain (or better, explain away) quantum\nprobabilities, given the subsequent difficulty in understanding\nforward-looking quantum probabilities in pure wave mechanics, that\nBohmian mechanics and other many-threads theories treat quantum\nprobability in an entirely straightforward way is a manifest virtue,\none that may ultimately be useful in finding a satisfactory extension\nof pure wave mechanics.\n9. Summary\n\nEverett took his version of the Wigner\u2019s Friend story to reveal\nan inconsistency in the standard collapse formulation of quantum\nmechanics and the incompleteness of the Copenhagen interpretation. On\nhis understanding, the quantum measurement problem was that neither\ntheory could account for the sort of nested measurement that occurs in\nthe Wigner\u2019s Friend story. Pure wave mechanics clearly provides\na consistent dynamical account of how the state of the composite\nsystem evolves in the context of nested measurement. Everett\u2019s\ntask then was to explain a sense in which pure wave mechanics might be\ntaken to be empirically faithful over determinate measurement records\nthat exhibit the standard quantum-mechanical statistics.\n\nEverett\u2019s relative-state formulation of pure wave mechanics has\na number of salient virtues. It eliminates the collapse dynamics and\nhence immediately resolves the potential conflict between the standard\ntheory\u2019s two dynamical laws. It is logically consistent,\napplicable to all physical systems, and arguably as simple as a\nformulation of quantum mechanics can be. And it is empirically\nfaithful in the sense that relative sequences of records exhibiting\nthe standard quantum statistics are typical.\n\nThe empirical problems with the relative state formulation of pure\nwave mechanics are illustrated by the fact that it provides neither\nprobabilistic predictions nor expectations for one\u2019s records at\na time or in the future. There are now a number reconstructions of\npure wave mechanics that add auxiliary assumptions in order to provide\na richer account of both determinate records and quantum probability.\nThe methodological goal is to add as little as possible to get a\nsatisfactory empirical theory given one\u2019s explanatory\ndemands.\n",
