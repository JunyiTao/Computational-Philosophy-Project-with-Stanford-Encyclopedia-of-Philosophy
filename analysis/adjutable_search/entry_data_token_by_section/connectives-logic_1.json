    "main_text": "Sequents and Valuations\n2. Sequents and Valuations\n\nLet us return to the propositional languages with which we began. A\nvaluation for such an L is a function from L\nto the two-element set {T, F} (of truth-values). As in the case of\nfirst-order languages touched on above, we put the set of formulas\nL in the source position (i.e. on the left) of our relational\nconnections \u27e8L, V, R\u27e9, with the\nset V of all valuations for L as the target (on the\nright), and R (the \u201cis true on\u201d relation) relates\n\u03c6 \u2208 L to v\n\u2208 V just in case\nv(\u03c6) = T. In view of the one-to-correspondence between\nsets and characteristic functions, this relational connection is just\na mild variant of the \u2208-based relational connection considered\nabove, in particular sharing with it the feature that it has\nconjunctive and disjunctive combinations on the right but not the\nleft, and the feature that no two elements from the left bear the\nrelation R to exactly the same elements on the right, and no\ntwo elements on the right have have exactly the same elements from the\nleft bearing the relation R to them. To get some interesting\nlogic under way, some of these features needed to be disturbed, though\nas we shall see, one of them\u2014the existence of conjunctive\ncombinations on the right\u2014will prove surprisingly tenacious. If\nour interest lies in classical logic, we will be especially keen to\ndiscard most of (the above) V and concentrate only on Boolean\nvaluations, in the sense to be explained now. A function from {T,\nF}n to {T, F} is called an\nn-ary truth-function, and we say that an\nn-ary truth-function f is associated with\nthe n-ary connective # of L on the valuation\nv (for L)\u2014or alternatively, under these same\nconditions, that # is associated with f on\nv\u2014just in case for all\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n \u2208\nL:\n\nv(#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)) =\nf(v(\u03c61),\u2026,v(\u03c6n)).\n\n\nWe describe the connective # as truth-functional with respect\nto a class U of valuations when there is some f such\nthat for each v \u2208 U, f is associated\nwith # on v, and as pseudo-truth-functional with\nrespect to U when U is a union of classes of\nvaluations with respect to each of which classes # is\n truth-functional.[4]\n A valuation v is #-Boolean, speaking informally, when the\nexpected truth-function is associated with # on v. More\nspecifically, v, assumed to be a valuation for a language\nsupporting the connectives to be mentioned here, is \u2227-Boolean when\nthe binary truth-function f\u2227 with\nf\u2227(x, y) = T iff x\n= y = T is associated with \u2227 on v, \u2228-Boolean\nwhen a similar association holds for \u2228 and\nf\u2228 defined by f\u2228(x,\ny) =\nF iff x = y = F. We\nassume that the idea is now clear without providing separate\ndefinitions of \u201c\u2192-Boolean\u201d,\n\u201c\u2194-Boolean\u201d, \u201c\u00ac-Boolean\u201d,\n\u201c\u22a5-Boolean\u201d, etc. A Boolean valuation for L is\njust a valuation for L which is #-Boolean for each primitive\nconnective # of L for which a notion of #-Boolean valuation has\nbeen defined. (This is just a way of registering an intended\ntruth-functional interpretation for the connectives # in question.)\nSimilarly we call any connective # for which a notion of #-Boolean\nvaluation has been defined, a Boolean connective, even when discussing\nits behaviour according to a logic not determined by a class of\nBoolean valuations. (This terminology will be explained in due\ncourse.)\n\nA set of truth-functions is strongly functionally complete if\nevery truth-function can be obtained by composition from functions in\nthe set, together with the projection functions, and weakly\nfunctionally complete if every truth-function can be obtained\nfrom functions in the set, together with the projection functions and\nthe operation of passing from an (n+1)-ary function to an\nn-ary function by dropping an inessential argument (an\nargument on which the function does not depend, that is). This\nterminology is transferred from truth-functions to Boolean connectives\nvia the conventional association of such connectives with\ntruth-functions described in the previous paragraph. Thus for example\neach of the sets {\u2227,\u00ac}, {\u2192,\u00ac} is weakly functionally\ncomplete, while {\u2192,\u22a5} is strongly functionally complete.\nThis weak/strong distinction is not usually registered in the literature, and functional\ncompleteness simpliciter is understood as weak functional\ncompleteness. These notions also apply in matrix semantics generally\n(see Section\n 5),\n and there are analogous notions of expressive completeness tailored\nto other areas; two distinct versions of expressive completeness in\nthe area of intuitionistic logic (the distinction being orthogonal to\nthe weak/strong distinction just drawn) are contrasted in Rousseau\n(1968), for example. None of these matters will occupy us further\nhere.\n\nIt is often useful to take a more fine-grained look at the\ntruth-functions in play in the above discussion. Assuming the\nidentification of n-ary functions with certain\n(n+1)-ary relations and the latter with sets of ordered\n(n+1)-tuples, we use the term determinant for the\nelements of a truth-function. Thus the four determinants of the\ntruth-function f\u2192 associated with \u2192 on\n\u2192-Boolean valuations are \u27e8T, T, T\u27e9, \u27e8T, F,\nF\u27e9, \u27e8F, T, T\u27e9, and \u27e8F, F, T\u27e9. Note that the\nfinal entry is the \u2018output\u2019 value for the function\nconcerned. Such determinants will occupy us extensively below.\n\nIn saying that a consequence relation \u22a2 is determined\nby a class V of valuations what is meant that \u0393\n\u22a2 \u03c8 if and only if for all v \u2208 V,\nwhenever v(\u03c6) = T for each \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393, then\nv(\u03c8)= T. When \u22a2 has been described by means of some\nproof system (some collection of rules), then the \u201conly\nif\u201d (\u201cif\u201d) direction of this claim amounts to the\nclaim that \u22a2 is sound (respectively, complete)\nwith respect to V. Take the language whose sole primitive\nconnective is \u2227 and the class of \u2227-Boolean valuations. A\nsimple proof system is provided by the rules indicated in the obvious\nway by the following figures:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u2227I)\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u03c8  \n\n \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8 \n\n  \n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(\u2227E)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c6  \n \n\u00a0,\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8  \n\n \u03c8  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nThe rule on the left is usually called \u2227-Introduction while the\ntwo on the right are collectively known as\n\u2227-Elimination\u2014thus \u201c(\u2227I)\u201d and\n\u201c(\u2227E)\u201d\u2014because they take us, respectively, to\nand from a formula with \u2227 as main connective, and they enable us\nto define a consequence relation, \u22a2\u2227 in purely\nsyntactic terms thus: \u0393 \u22a2\u2227 \u03c6 just in\ncase starting with formulas all of which lie in \u0393, successive\napplication of the above rules allows us to pass eventually to the\nformula \u03c6. And then one can show, not only that this is the\nconsequence relation determined by the class of \u2227-Boolean\nvaluations\u2014so that if one began with that class and sought a\nsyntactic codification of the logic it gave rise to, one\u2019s\nsearch would be at an end\u2014but further that the valuations\nconsistent with \u22a2\u2227 are precisely the\n\u2227-Boolean valuations. Here we calling v consistent\nwith \u22a2 when for no \u0393, \u03c8, for which \u0393\n\u22a2 \u03c8, do we have v(\u03c6) = T for all \u03c6 \u2208\n\u0393 while v(\u03c8) = F; the \u201cbut further\u201d in\nthe preceding sentence is explained by the fact that every consequence\nrelation \u22a2 is determined by the class Val(\u22a2) of all\nvaluations consistent with \u22a2, which in the case of\n\u22a2\u2227 are precisely the \u2227-Boolean valuations.\n(See the discussion of Gabbay\u2019s result on the\nprojection-conjunction truth-functions below for the extent of this\nphenomenon, which, for example, none of \u2228, \u2192, \u00ac exhibits.)\nThe significance of this is that if one started not with the class of\n\u2227-Boolean valuations (or any other kind of valuational semantics),\nbut with the rules (\u2227I) and (\u2227E) themselves, then that class\nof valuations would force itself on one\u2019s attention anyway as\nthe only class of valuations, preservation of truth on each of which\ncoincided with derivability using those rules. (We return to this\ntheme below, in connection with Carnap, by which time we will have\ntraded in formula-to-formula rules for sequent-to-sequent rules,\nallowing for the convenient representation of inferences in which\nassumptions are discharged.) Moreover, the rules have a considerable\nclaim to the status of rules in accordance with which one must reason\nif one is understanding \u2227 as \u201cand\u201d, as providing a\ncodification of the way in which conjunctive premisses and conclusions\nare reasoned from and to in natural day-to-day reasoning.\n\nNow, as Gerhard Gentzen observed, when we come to formulate similarly\ncompelling principles for introducing and eliminating the other\nconnectives, we find ourselves having to make reference to the\ndischarging of assumptions temporarily made for the sake of\nargument. Such is the case for instance with formulating an\nintroduction rule for \u2192 and with formulating an elimination rule\nfor \u2228. In the case of the former rule, for example, Gentzen took it\nthat the way to derive \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 is to assume \u03c6 and use\nthe various rules and other assumptions to derive \u03c8, at which\npoint the rule (also called Conditional Proof) allows us to claim that\nwe have derived \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 from the remaining assumptions,\nwithout having to record this conclusion as depending on \u03c6 (as\n\u03c8 itself did before the rule was applied). Thus to extend the\npresent approach, known as natural deduction, from \u2227 to\nthese and other connectives, it is necessary to keep track not only of\nwhat formulas we are dealing with at a given stage but also of the set\nof initial formulas, or assumptions, on which that formula depends. We\nwant to say, in the case of the rule just described, that it entitles\nus to pass from \u03c8, as depending on \u0393 \u222a {\u03c6}, to \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8, as depending on \u0393. The ordered pair of a finite\nset of formulas and an individual formula, \u27e8\u0393, \u03c6\u27e9\nwhose first entry records the set of formulas on which its second\nentry depends, we write in the more suggestive notation \u0393\n\u227b \u03c6, and call a sequent, or more explicitly, a\nsequent of the logical framework Set-Fmla.\nFor the variant framework Set-Fmla0,\nwe\nallow also the case in which there is no formula to the right of the\n\u201c\u227b\u201d. Some principles for reasoning about sequents\nwhich do not involve any specific connectives and were called by\nGentzen, structural rules (as opposed to operational\nrules) are the following, which are respectively a zero-premiss, a\none-premiss and a two-premiss sequent-to-sequent rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Id)\n \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6  \n \n\n\n\n(Weakening)\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c8  \n\n \u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u03c8\n \n  \n \n\n\n\n(Cut)\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394 \u227b\n\u03c6  \n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u227b\n\u03c8  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nAs the notation makes clear, we use the same shortcuts in formulations\ninvolving the regular turnstile (\u22a2) as for the current variant\n(\u227b), despite the difference in role played by these two symbols:\nthe former is a metalinguistic predicate and the latter a device for\nseparating the two sides of a sequent. (\u201c\u227b\u201d,\narranging formulas into sequents, is, as Lemmon (1965) says of his\ncorresponding notation, the formal analogue of the word\n\u201ctherefore\u201d, which arranges sentences into arguments. The\nformer is, by contrast, for making comments about such\narguments\u2014for example to the effect that they are valid. Of\ncourse there is a little slack in the analogy for Set-Fmla,\nsince we allow the\ncase where there are no premisses.) Any collection \u03a3 of sequents\nwhich is closed under the structural rules above gives rise to a\ncorresponding (finitary) consequence relation: \u0393\n\u22a2\u03a3 \u03c6 iff for some finite\n\u03930 \u2286 \u0393, we have \u03930\u227b\n\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a3. We should also have a sequent-based analogue of\nthe notion of a valuation\u2019s being consistent with a consequence\nrelation; accordingly we say that a sequent \u0393 \u227b \u03c6\nholds on the valuation v just in case we do not have\nv(\u03c8) = T for each \u03c8 \u2208\n\u0393 while also v(\u03c6) = F. (When \u0393 is empty, the\nsequent holds on v just in case v(\u03c6) = T. It\nwould be uncouth to speak of a sequent as being true on a valuation,\nhowever, just as one would not speak of the truth of an argument. Such\nusages are on a par with, and closely allied to, the mistaken\nconception of \u227b as a kind of connective.)\n\nWe can now formulate the desired \u2192-introduction rule so that the\nassumption discharge feature is visible in what happens on the left of\nthe sequent-separator as we move from premiss-sequent to\nconclusion-sequent. We write the elimination rule alongside in a\nsimilar notation; included also are the natural deduction rules for\n\u2228; the earlier rules for \u2227 should be imagined as re-written\nalong similar lines, with assumption-dependencies made explicit:\n\n\n\n (\u2192I) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u03c8  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6\n\u2192 \u03c8  \n  \n\n\n\n (\u2192E) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394\n\u227b \u03c6  \n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u227b\n\u03c8  \n  \n\n\n\n (\u2228I) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8  \n \n \u00a0,\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c8  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n (\u2228E) \n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394,\u03c6 \u227b\n\u03c7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0398,\u03c8 \u227b \u03c7  \n\n \u0393, \u0394, \u0398\n\u227b \u03c7  \n  \n\n\n\nAlong with the \u2227 rules reformulated in the above\nsequent-to-sequent style, and the structural rule\n(Id)\u2014(Weakening) and (Cut) being derivable\u2014these rules\nrender provable exactly those sequents in {\u2227,\u2228,\u2192}-fragment\nof intuitionistic logic, while for the corresponding fragment of\nclassical logic, one would need to add a further principle governing\nimplication, such as the following subcontrariety rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Subc\u2192)\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u03c8\u00a0\u227b\u00a0\u03c7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393,\u00a0\u03c6\u00a0\u227b\u00a0\u03c7\n \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u03c7 \n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n(Equivalently, in view of Weakening, one could give a formulation with\n\u201c\u0394\u201d as a set-variable for the right sequent premiss,\nand carry both \u201c\u0393\u201d and \u201c\u0394\u201d down to\nthe conclusion-sequent, as in the formulation of (\u2192E) above.) In\nthe terminology of Dummett (1991) all of the rules we have seen are\npure (their schematic formulation involves mention only of a\nsingle connective) and simple (each formulation mentions it\nonly once), this last rule is also oblique: a discharged\nassumption has the connective in question as its main connective. One\ncan trade in this obliqueness for a loss of simplicity, changing the\n\u2192-elimination rule from the familiar Modus Ponens principle above\nto a version incorporating Peirce\u2019s Law (\u201c(p\n\u2192 q) \u2192 p \u227b p\u201d), due\nto\n Kanger:[5]\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0394\n\u227b (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c7) \u2192 \u03c6  \n\n \u0393, \u0394 \u227b\n\u03c8  \n\n\n\nor sacrifice purity and have a zero-premiss rule \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n(\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8), or again just leave the implicational rules as\nthey are and rely on further rules (not given here) governing negation\nto make up the shortfall and render such classically but not\nintuitionistically acceptable \u2192-sequents\u2014such as\nPeirce\u2019s Law above\u2014provable with their aid. (The same\ntensions would then arise for the \u00ac rules, if one regards\nobliqueness as undesirable, with \u201cdouble negation\nelimination\u201d principles abandoning simplicity, or\n\u201cexcluded middle\u201d principles, abandoning purity. Note that\nby a \u2018classically acceptable sequent\u2019 here is meant a\nsequent holding on all Boolean valuations.) An alternative for\ncapturing the classical logic of \u2192 is to change from the logical\nframework Set-Fmla to\nSet-Set, in which\nfinite (possibly empty) sets of formulas appear on the right of the\n\u227b, just as on the left. Then the above \u2192-Introduction rule\ncan be remain intact, but with a set variable to collect side-formulas\non the right: from \u0393, \u03c6\u227b\u03c8, \u0394 to\n\u0393\u227b\u03c6\u2192\u03c8, \u0394. (Suitable modifications\nshould also be made to the remaining rules in this case.) These\n\u2018multiple-succedent\u2019 sequents are more popularly\nassociated with a different approach to logic from the natural\ndeduction approach (though they have often appeared in this setting),\nnamely the sequent calculus approach, in which instead of being\ninserted or removed from the right of the \u227b, by suitable\nintroduction or elimination rules, together with the possible\ndischarge of assumptions, the rules\u2014again, ideally, pure and\nsimple\u2014always insert a connective, either to the left or the\nright, of the \u201c\u227b\u201d. The left insertion rules do the\nwork of the elimination rules of the natural deduction approach, while\nthe right insertion rules do the work of\u2014indeed, are\njust\u2014the natural deduction introduction rules. The left\ninsertion rules, (# Left) for #\n\u2208 {\u2227,\u2228,\u2192} are then as follows for\nthe classical case, with the right insertion rules (#\nRight) being the natural deduction introduction rules as above,\nwith a set-variable on the right of the \u227b for the classical\nSet-Set case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u2227 Left)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393,\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8\n\u227b \u0394  \n \n \u00a0,\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c8 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393,\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8\n\u227b \u0394  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n(\u2228 Left)\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b\n\u0394\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393\u2032, \u03c8 \u227b \u0394\u2032\n \n\n\n\u0393,\u0393\u2032,\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 \u227b \u0394,\n\u0394\u2032  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n(\u2192 Left)\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6,\n\u0394\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u0393\u2032,\u03c8 \u227b \u0394\u2032\n \n\n\n\u0393,\u0393\u2032,\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8 \u227b \u0394,\n\u0394\u2032  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nFor formulations restricted to Set-Fmla0,\nand thus suitable for the\nintuitionistic sequent calculus, we require that \u0394 in (\u2227\nLeft) contains at most one formula, and for (\u2228 Left) and (\u2192\nLeft), that \u0394 \u222a \u0394\u2032 contains at most one formula.\nIndeed, one easily sees that using the structural rules mentioned\nearlier and the operational rules described here, there will always be\nexactly one formula, since proofs all begin with (Id) and no rule\nremoves all formulas from the right-hand side (or\n\u2018succedent\u2019) in the transition from premiss sequents to\nconclusion sequent. This changes if we add the rules for negation,\nhere giving both the left and the right insertion rules, initially for\nthe Set-Set case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(\u00ac Left)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0393 \u227b \u03c6 \u0394  \n\n \u0393,\u00ac\u03c6 \u227b\n\u0394  \n  \n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(\u00ac\nRight)\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\u0393,\u03c6 \u227b \u0394  \n\n \u0393 \u227b \u00ac\u03c6,\n\u0394  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nA Set-Set sequent\n\u0393\u227b \u0394 holds on a valuation v if and only if\nit is not the case that v verifies every formula in \u0393\nwhile falsifying every formula in \u0394; note that this coincides\nwith the definition of \u201cholding on v\u201d given for\nSet-Fmla in the case\nin which \u0394 = {\u03c8} for some \u03c8. Similarly, we have the\nnotion of a generalized consequence relation in which\nsuitably two-sided versions of the conditions definitive of\nconsequence relations are given, which can be found in Shoesmith and\nSmiley (1978), Chapter 2, for example (under the name\n\u2018multiple-conclusion consequence relation\u2019). If \u22a9 is\nsuch a relation on a language L then an L-valuation\nv is said to be consistent with \u22a9 when there\ndo not exist \u0393, \u0394, with v(\u03c6)\n= T for all \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393 and\nv(\u03c8) = F for all \u03c8\n\u2208 \u0394. The class of all such\nvaluations is denoted, much as in the consequence relation case, by\nVal(\u22a9). Sometimes formulations appear below with the phrase\n\u201c(generalized) consequence relation\u201d, meaning that the\nclaim being made or considered applies both in the case of consequence\nrelations and in the case of generalized consequence relations.\n\nOne should distinguish sharply between logical frameworks,\nthat is, choices as to what kind of thing a sequent is (e.g., Set-Fmla\nvs. Set-Set),\non the one hand,\nand approaches to logic, that is, choices as to what kind of\nsequent-to-sequent rules are to be used (e.g., natural deduction\nvs. sequent calculus), on the other. Gentzen (1934) used\nSet-Set for a\nclassical sequent calculus and Set-Fmla\nfor the intuitionistic case. (More accurately,\nsince he had finite sequences of formulas in mind rather than sets,\nand in the latter case allowed empty but not multiple succedents, we\nshould really say something long the lines of Seq-Seq\nand Seq-Fmla0,\nrespectively. Additional structural rules are then needed to allow\npermutation of formulas in a sequence.) Rudolf Carnap (1943) had a\nrather different reason for passing from Set-Fmla\nto Set-Set,\none which is\nsemantically based rather than grounded in considerations of\nproof-theoretic elegance.\n\nLet us forget about \u2192 and \u00ac and the rules governing them, and\nconsider the formulas constructed with the aid only of \u2227 and \u2228.\nOn sequents of Set-Fmla\nin this fragment, classical and intuitionistic\nlogic agree, and the consequence relation\nconcerned\u2014\u22a2\u2227,\u2228, we may call it\u2014is\nthe consequence relation determined by the class of all \u2227- and\n\u2228-Boolean valuations. Carnap\u2019s point is one anticipated\nearlier with the remark that every v \u2208\nVal(\u22a2\u2227) is \u2227-Boolean, which extends to the\ncase of \u22a2\u2227,\u2228: all valuations in\nVal(\u22a2\u2227,\u2228) are \u2227-Boolean, but they are not\nall \u2228-Boolean, for the simple reason that for any consequence\nrelation \u22a2, Val(\u22a2) is always closed under conjunctive\ncombinations, and it is easy to find \u2228-Boolean u,\nv, with u \u22c5 v not\n \u2228-Boolean.[6]\n It is interesting to see this as an appeal to the considerations of\nSection\n 1\n as follows. Consider the binary relational connection between the set\nof formulas in a language one of whose connectives is \u2228 and the\nclass of Boolean valuations, with the relation is true on. We\nhave disjunctive combinations on the left, with \u03c6\n+ \u03c8 as \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8, since the\nvaluations on the right are all \u2228-Boolean; therefore we cannot in\ngeneral have conjunctive combinations on the left, since the crossover\ncondition is not satisfied for this connection. The closure claim\napplies quite generally, with \u220f\u2009V \u2208\nVal(\u22a2) whenever V \u2286 Val(\u22a2). This fact\nappears in the philosophical literature in the fact that\nsupervaluations over classes of bivalent valuations deliver the same\nconsequence relation as the original valuations, which is accordingly\nclassical when the valuations are Boolean. (Supervaluations are\nsupposed to be non-bivalent, in verifying those formulas verified by\nall the underlying valuations and falsifying those formulas false on\nall the underlying valuations, with those in neither category being\nneither true nor false on the supervaluation. But everything in this\ndefinition after the words \u201cverified by all the underlying\nvaluations\u201d is mere rhetoric, since all that matters\u2014for a\nsequent\u2019s holding on a valuation or a valuation\u2019s being\nconsistent with a consequence relation\u2014is truth-preservation;\nsetting it to one side, we can identify the supervaluation over\nV with \u220f\u2009V. Likewise in the case of\n\u2018subvaluations\u2019\u2014as in Hyde (2005)\u2014where it is\n\u2211\u2009V that would be relevant.) A special case arises\nwith V = \u2205, for which \u220f\u2009V is the\nunique valuation vT assigning T to every formula\n(of the language in question, to which the claim of uniqueness is\nunderstood as relativized).\n\nOne may wonder which truth-functions are like that associated (on\n\u2227-Boolean valuations) with \u2227 in this respect. More precisely,\nlet \u22a2 be the consequence relation determined by the class of\nvaluations on each of which an n-ary connective\n#f is associated with the n-ary\ntruth-function f. Our question is: for which choices of\nf does \u22a2 enforce the interpretation of\n#f as f in the sense that on every\nv \u2208 Val(\u22a2), #f is associated\nwith f. This question was answered in Dov Gabbay (1978) and\n(1981) (Chapter 1, Section 3) as follows. Say that f (as\nabove) is a projection-conjunction truth-function just in\ncase for some J \u2286 {1,\u2026,n} we have, for\nall x1,\u2026,xn\n(xi \u2208 {T, F}):\n\nf(x1,\u2026,xn)\n= T if and only if for all j \u2208 J,\nxj = T.\n\n\nThen the truth-functions f for which every valuation\nconsistent with \u22a2 (as above) associates #f\nwith f are precisely the projection-conjunction\ntruth-functions. (Gabbay calls #f, as it behaves\naccording to \u22a2, strongly classical in these cases,\nthough his own definition is not formulated in these terms.) By way of\nexample: when n = 1, these are the identity and the\nconstant-true functions, while for n = 2, they are the first\nprojection, second projection, constant true and (Boolean) conjunction\ntruth-functions. (The constant true cases arise by taking J\nas \u2205.) The remaining 12 binary truth-functions thus exhibit the\nbehaviour we saw with the disjunction truth-function; the\ncorresponding connectives are what Gabbay calls weakly\nclassical: determined by a class of valuations over which the\nconnective is associated with a certain truth-function despite the\nexistence of further consistent valuation on which it is not so\nassociated. It is easy to see that the latter phenomenon does not\narise in the case of generalized consequence relations \u22a9, since\nwe can easily write down unconditional conditions on such relations\nwhich enforce the association with a particular truth-function on\nvaluations in Val(\u22a9). This is best seen as proceeding\ndeterminant by determinant. The unenforceable determinant in the case\nof disjunction is \u27e8F, F, F\u27e9, dictating that when the\ndisjuncts have the values listed in the first two positions, the\ndisjunction has the value listed in the final position. This\ndeterminant induces in a familiar way (e.g., Segerberg 1982,\n\u00a73.3) the following condition on \u22a9: that for all \u03c6,\n\u03c8, we have \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 \u22a9 \u03c6, \u03c8. Alternatively\nput, in Set-Set, as\nopposed to Set-Fmla,\nthere is a set of formulas holding on precisely the \u2228-Boolean\nvaluations, namely that containing, for all formulas \u03c6, \u03c8, the\nsequents \u03c6 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8, and \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6 \u2228\n\u03c8, and\u2014the new case not already available in Set-Fmla\u2014\u03c6\n\u2228\n\u03c8 \u227b \u03c6, \u03c8. In view of this, we can say that in Set-Set\nthough not in Set-Fmla,\nthe class of\n\u2228-Boolean valuations is sequent-definable, and the same\ngoes for connectives associated with all the other truth-functions not\nmeeting the projection-conjunction test (such as negation and material\nimplication). As the \u2228 example makes clear, by contrast with the\ncase of consequence relations, Val(\u22a9), for a generalized\nconsequence relation \u22a9, need not be closed under conjunctive\n combinations.[7]\n Again, one can see this in the light of the considerations of Section\n 1,\n thinking of the relational connection between Set-Set\nsequents and\narbitrary valuations, with the relation being \u2018holds on\u2019.\nThis connection supplies disjunctive combinations on the left, with\n\u03c3 + \u03c3\u2032 being the least common weakening of \u03c3\nand\n \u03c3\u2032.[8]\n Thus it cannot also supply conjunctive combinations on the right,\nsince it does not satisfy the crossover condition.\n\nThis approximately Carnapian concern with\nsequent-definability\u2014in particular the exclusion of unwanted\nnon-Boolean valuations\u2014can be taken to a higher level by moving\nfrom questions about sequents and the valuations they hold, to\nquestions about rules and the valuations they preserve the property of\nholding on, as we shall see in Section\n 3,\n after making some further points about the apparatus of consequence\nrelations, or logics in the framework Set-Fmla.\nThe\ndeterminant-induced conditions on generalized consequence relations\nalluded to above can be converted into conditions on consequence\nrelations in a straightforward way, illustrated here in the case of\nnegation, with the condition\n\nfor all \u03c6: \u03c6, \u00ac\u03c6 \u22a9 \u2205\n\n\n(induced by \u27e8T, F\u27e9) becoming\n\nfor all \u03c6, \u03c8,: \u03c6, \u00ac\u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8\n\n\nand the condition\n\nfor all \u03c6: \u22a9 \u03c6, \u00ac\u03c6\n\n\n(induced by \u27e8F, T\u27e9) turning into the conditional\ncondition on consequence relations \u22a9:\n\nfor all \u0393, \u03c6, \u03c8, if \u0393, \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 and\n\u0393, \u00ac\u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 then \u0393 \u22a2 \u03c8.\n\n\nIn a proof system in Set-Fmla\nsuch conditional requirements emerge as\nsequent-to-sequent rules, closure under which (along with containing\nall the sequents corresponding to the unconditional requirements) will\nsuffice to secure completeness\u2014in this case that any unprovable\nsequent fails to hold on some \u00ac-Boolean valuation\u2014without\nthe strong classicality property of having the provable sequents hold\nonly on such valuations. (The process just described\ntransforms the Set-Set\ncondition, \u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 \u227b \u03c6,\n\u03c8 (all \u03c6, \u03c8), induced by the Set-Fmla\nunenforceable \u2228\ndeterminant \u27e8F, F, F\u27e9, into the\nconditional condition of closure under the rule (\u2228E).) If\na generalized consequence relation \u22a9 with a Boolean connective #\nin its language satisfies all the conditions induced by the\ndeterminants of the associated truth-function we call \u22a9\n#-classical. Similarly for a consequence relation which\nsatisfies the conditions on consequence\nrelations\u2014conditional conditions\nincluded\u2014derived, as just described, from these\ndeterminant-induced conditions on generalized consequence relations.\n(These versions of #-classicality can often be simplified on a\ncase-by-case basis. For example, the \u2227-classicality of a\nconsequence relation or generalized consequence relation\u2014we use\nthe former notation here\u2014is equivalent to its being the case\nthat for all \u03c6, \u03c8, we have (1) \u03c6, \u03c8\n\u22a2 \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8, (2) \u03c6 \u2227\n\u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6, and (3) \u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8\n\u22a2 \u03c8. Here we see a three-part condition, instead of\nthe four-part condition comprising the conditions induced by each of\nthe four determinants.)\n\nConsideration of the determinant-induced conditions on generalized\nconsequence relations allows us incidentally to observe, somewhat\nsurprisingly, that consequence relations (and the Set-Fmla\nframework) manage\nto distinguish the logics of any two truth-functions of the same\narity. More precisely, suppose that f and g are\ndistinct n-ary truth-functions, # is an n-ary\nconnective, and Vf and\nVg are the classes of valuations on\nwhich, respectively, f and g are associated with #;\nthen the consequence relations determined by\nVf and Vg\nare distinct. By way of illustration, suppose that n = 3 and\nf and g differ on some determinant beginning with T,\nF, F. (Thus we are considering the case in which the first component\nof a #-compound is true on a given valuation and the second and third\nare false.) Without loss of generality, we can assume that \u27e8T, F,\nF, T\u27e9 \u2208 f while \u27e8T, F, F, F\u27e9 \u2208\ng. The conditions on a generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9 induced by these determinants are respectively \u03c6\n\u22a9 \u03c8, \u03c7, #(\u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c7)\nand \u03c6, #(\u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c7) \u22a9 \u03c8,\n\u03c7. Thus in particular, taking \u03c6 as p and each\nof \u03c8, \u03c7, as q, for the generalized consequence\nrelation \u22a9f, say, determined by\nVf and that,\n\u22a9g, determined by\nVg, we have:\n\n\n\n p \u22a9f q,\n#(p, q, q) \n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n p, #(p, q, q)\n\u22a9g q.  \n\n\n\nNote that p, #(p, q, q)\n\u22aef q, since otherwise it would\nfollow (by the \u2018cut\u2019 condition on generalized consequence\nrelations) from the first inset \u22a9-statement here that p\n\u22a9f q, which is not the case. Thus\nin view of the second \u22a9-statement, \u22a9f\nand \u22a9g differ on the sequent \u03c3 =\np, #(p, q, q)\u227b q,\nsince \u03c3 \u2208 \u22a9g while \u03c3\n\u2209 \u22a9f. But \u03c3 is a sequent of\nSet-Fmla, so the\nconsequence relations, \u22a2f and\n\u22a2g, say, determined respectively by\nVf and Vg\nalso differ (namely, on \u03c3). We have worked through a simple\nillustration of the general result claimed above, but this case is\nsufficiently representative for the general proof to be\nreconstructed.\n\nIndeed the real moral is more general still. We did not need to use,\nin our worked example, more than the fact that there was some\ndeterminant respected by every valuation in\nVf with the opposite determinant\nrespected by every valuation in Vg, where\nV respects a determinant \u27e8x1,\u2026,xn,xn+1\u27e9\nfor # (with each xi\n\u2208 {T, F}) just in case for all formulas \u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n,\nv(\u03c6i) =\nxi for i\n= 1,\u2026, n implies v(#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n= xn+1, and determinants are\nopposite if they differ in precisely their final positions.\n(Actually, inspection of the worked example shows that we also need\nthe classes playing the role of Vf and\nVg also to contain enough valuations to\nassign different truth-values to any pair of distinct propositional\nvariables.) Take the 1-ary connective \u2610 of any familiar modal\nlogic (e.g., S5), for example. We expect it to satisfy the\ndeterminant \u27e8F, F\u27e9, in the sense that the appropriate\nconsequence relation should satisfy the condition induced by this\ndeterminant, since what is necessarily true is true\u2014and thus if\n\u03c6 is false, \u2610\u03c6 should be false\u2014while we do not\nwant any determinant of the form \u27e8T, x\u27e9 to be\nsatisfied. In this case we can describe \u2610 as partially\ndetermined according to the consequence relation in question. On\nthe other hand, if a consequence relation \u22a2 (or a generalized\nconsequence relation \u22a9) satisfies, for each n-tuple of\ntruth-values, the condition induced by exactly one determinant for the\nn-ary connective #, whose first n entries are as\ngiven by that n-tuple (the final, n+1st,\nentry being either a T or an F), then we say # is fully\ndetermined according to \u22a2 (or \u22a9). By the\ndeterminant-induced conditions on a consequence relation here is meant\nthe conditions on a consequence relation derived as explained (or at\nleast illustrated) above from the directly determinant-induced\nconditions on a generalized consequence relation. As one might expect,\nthis property of connectives relative to consequence relations has an\nintimate relation with the similar property introduced at the start of\nthis section:\n\nA connective # in the language of a consequence relation \u22a2 is\nfully determined according to \u22a2 if and only if there is some\nclass of valuations V such that \u22a2 is determined by\nV and # is truth-functional with respect to V.\n\n\nNote that the two occurrences of the word \u2018determined\u2019\nhere mean quite different things. \u201cFully determined\u201d, as\ndefined above, is a variation on Segerberg\u2019s terminology in his\n(1982) of \u2018type-determined\u2019, varied so as to lend itself\nto other modifications\u2014partially determined,\ncompletely undetermined, overdetermined,\u2026\n(though this last will not be getting attention here)\u2014while the\nsecond occurrence of the word is the usual sound and complete\nsense of \u201cdetermined\u201d. Turning to generalized consequence\nrelations, we find the connection to be more intimate still:\n\nA connective # in the language of a generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9 is fully determined according to \u22a9 if and only if # is\ntruth-functional with respect to Val(\u22a9).\n\n\nThis implies the statement given for consequence relations (putting\n\u201c\u22a9\u201d in place of \u201c\u22a2\u201d) since a\ngeneralized consequence relation, like a consequence relation, is\nalways determined by the class of all valuations consistent with it.\n(But only the weaker statement above is available for consequence\nrelations, as such cases as that of \u2228 illustrates, since the\nconsequence relation determined by the class of \u2228-Boolean\nvaluations\u2014with respect to to which \u2228 is by definition\ntruth-functional\u2014is also determined by other classes of\nvaluations, with respect to it is not.) Indeed another way of putting\nthe contrast between the consequence relations claim above and the\ngeneralized consequence relations claim is that while for consequence\nrelations #\u2018s being fully determined according to \u22a2 is\nequivalent to some class of valuations which determines\n\u22a2 having # truth-functional with respect to it, for generalized\nconsequence relations we can say that #\u2018s being fully determined\naccording to \u22a9 is equivalent to every class of\nvaluations which determines \u22a9 having # truth-functional with\nrespect to it.\n\nAlong with truth-functionality, we also included a definition of\npseudo-truth-functionality with respect to V. A simple way of\nseeing the relation between these two concepts is in an\n\u2200/\u2203 scope contrast (in which \u201cf\u201d\nranges over truth-functions of the same arity as #): # is\ntruth-functional with respect to V when\n\n\u2203f\u2200v \u2208 V[f is\nassociated with # on v],\n\n\nwhereas # is pseudo-truth-functional with respect to V\nwhen\n\n\u2200v \u2208 V\u2203f[f is\nassociated with # on v].\n\n\nIt is natural to ask after a syntactical condition related to\npseudo-truth-functionality in the same way(s) as full determination is\nrelated to truth-functionality. Say that an n-ary connective\n# is left-extensional in its ith position\n(1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) or right-extensional in\nits ith position, according to a generalized\nconsequence relation \u22a9, when the condition\n(LEi) or (REi) is satisfied,\nrespectively, for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n,\u03c8 in the\nlanguage of \u22a9 we have:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEi\n:\n \u03c6i, \u03c8,\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n) \u22a9\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6i\u22121,\u03c8,\u03c6i+1,\u2026,\u03c6n),\n \n  \n\n\n\n\nREi\n:\n #(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n\u22a9\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6i\u22121,\u03c8,\u03c6i+1,\u2026,\u03c6n),\n\u03c6i, \u03c8.  \n  \n\n\n\n# is left-extensional (right-extensional) according to \u22a9 if it\nis left-extensional (respectively, right-extensional) in its\nith position for each i (1\n\u2264 i \u2264 n), and finally #\nis extensional according to \u22a9 when # is both left- and\nright-extensional according to \u22a9. For n = 1 we drop the\nsubscript, the above conditions reducing to (LE) and (RE):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLE\n:\n \u03c6, \u03c8, #\u03c6 \u22a9 #\u03c8,  \n  \n\n\n\n\nRE\n:\n #\u03c6\u22a9 #\u03c8, \u03c6, \u03c8.  \n  \n\n\n\nThus (LE) requires that each v \u2208 Val(\u22a9)\n\u201ctreats truths alike\u201d when they are embedded under #, in\nthe sense that when v(\u03c6) =\nv(\u03c8) = T, then v(#\u03c6)\n= v(#\u03c8), while (RE) requires that falsehoods be\ntreated alike in that v(\u03c6) =\nv(\u03c8) = F likewise implies that v(#\u03c6)\n= v(#\u03c8). (It may\nhelp to remark that for \u2194-classical \u22a2 together these amount\nto requiring that \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 \u22a2 #\u03c6\n\u2194 #\u03c8. But we are trying to keep the discussion\n\u2018pure\u2019 so that definitions make sense even when the\nconnective\u2014here #\u2014with the property being defined is the\nsole connective in the language.) The conditions\n(LEi) already make sense as conditions on\nconsequence relations (writing \u22a2 for \u22a9) since there is a\nsingle formula on the right, and we will speak of # as\nleft-extensional according to \u22a2 when they are all satisfied,\nwhile the conditions (REi) need to be converted\ninto conditional conditions as above in the discussion of\ndeterminant-induced conditions. We will illustrate this only for the\nn = 1 case, with (RE) becoming (RE\u2032), understood as\ndemanding for all \u0393, \u03c6, \u03c8, \u03c7:\n\n\n\nRE\u2032\n:\n If \u0393, #\u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c7 and \u0393 , \u03c6 \u22a2\n\u03c7 and \u0393 , \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c7, then \u0393, #\u03c6 \u22a2\n\u03c7.  \n\n\n\nTaking it that the intention is clear for the general case what\n(RE\u2032i) should be as a condition on\nconsequence relations, we say that # is right-extensional according to\n\u22a2 when (RE\u2032i) is satisfied for each\ni up to the arity of #, and that # is extensional according\nto \u22a2 just in case # is both left- and right-extensional\naccording to \u22a2. Then paralleling the above results for\ntruth-functionality are the following for\npseudo-truth-functionality:\n\nA connective # in the language of a consequence relation \u22a2 is\nextensional according to \u22a2 if and only if there is some class of\nvaluations V such that \u22a2 is determined by V\nand # is pseudo-truth-functional with respect to V.\n\n\nA connective # in the language of a generalized consequence relation\n\u22a9 is extensional according to \u22a9 if and only if # is\npseudo-truth-functional with respect to Val(\u22a9).\n\n\nWhether for consequence relations or for generalized consequence\nrelations, we have the following\u2014in general,\nirreversible\u2014implications for the three properties of being\nfully determined, being extensional, and being congruential (as\nexplained below) according to any given (generalized) consequence\n relation:[9]\n\nfully determined \u21d2 extensional \u21d2\ncongruential.\n\n\nwhere this last concept is defined by saying that # is\ncongruential in the ith position\naccording to a consequence relation or generalized consequence\nrelation \u22a2 or \u22a9 (we state the condition only using the\n\u201c\u22a2\u201d notation) just in case for all formulas\n\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n,\u03c8:\n\n\u03c6i \u22a3\u22a2 \u03c8 implies\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6n)\n\u22a3\u22a2\n#(\u03c61,\u2026,\u03c6i\u22121,\u03c8,\u03c6i+1,\u2026,\u03c6n),\n\n\nand calling # congruential according to \u22a2 when # is congruential\nin each of its positions according to \u22a2. Clearly a consequence\nrelation is congruential in the sense of Section\n 1\u2014which\n of course also makes sense for generalized consequence\nrelations\u2014precisely when each primitive connective in its\nlanguage is congruential in every position according to it. A similar\nlifting of properties of connectives\u2014\u2018according to\u2019\n(generalized) consequence relations\u2014can be made in the other\ncases too, for example calling a consequence relation fully determined\nwhen each of the primitive connectives of its language is fully\ndetermined according to it. Thus we may say that the consequence\nrelation \u22a2CL of classical logic (with any\ngiven stock of primitive connectives\u2014though we will not further\ndecorate the notation to indicate a particular fragment) is fully\ndetermined and thus also extensional (and congruential), while the\nconsequence relation \u22a2I\u2009L of\nintuitionistic logic is congruential but not extensional, since for\nexample, \u00ac, is not right-extensional according to\n\u22a2I\u2009L. The consequence relation\ndetermined by the well-known three-element matrix of \u0141ukasiewicz\nis not even congruential, since (again) \u00ac is not congruential\naccording to this relation. There is a weaker property than\nextensionality as here defined (for the sake of the above connection\nwith pseudo-truth-functionality) which properly implies left\nextensionality but not right extensionality and which, unlike left\nextensionality itself, implies congruentiality. We could define #,\nhere taken for illustrative purposes again as 1-ary, to be weakly\nextensional according to a consequence relation \u22a2 when for all\n\u0393, \u03c6, \u03c8:\n\n\u0393, \u03c6 \u22a2 \u03c8 and \u0393, \u03c8 \u22a2 \u03c6 imply\n\u0393, #\u03c6 \u22a2 # \u03c8.\n\n\nThus weak extensionality is congruentiality \u2018with side\nformulas\u2019 (collected into \u0393). The obvious adaptation of\nthis notion to generalized consequence relations would be to allow\nside-formulas on the right too (replacing the\nabove\u201c\u22a2\u201d by \u201c\u22a9\u201d and adding a set\nvariable \u201c\u0394\u201d to the right-hand sides, that is): this\nturns out to be equivalent to extensionality for generalized\nconsequence relations as defined above in terms of\n(LEi) and (REi).\n\u22a2I\u2009L is weakly extensional in this\nsense, and weak extensionality according to \u22a2 \u2287\n\u22a2I\u2009L is a property of some theoretical\nsignificance for the case in which the language of \u22a2 adds new\nconnectives in the spirit of the original intuitionistic \nprimitives.[10]\n\n\nReturning to the subject of extensionality, one area in which\nextensional but not fully determined connectives arises is when one\ntakes hybrids of the latter. By the hybrid of disjunction and\nconjunction, for example, understanding \u2228 and \u2227 to have the\ninferential powers conferred on them by a particular logic, is meant a\nbinary connective whose inferential powers are those shared \u2227 and\n\u2228. (See Rautenberg 1989 for this example, and Rautenberg 1991\nand references therein for more in this vein.) Note that the\nconnectives hybridized and the resulting hybrid are connectives in the\n\u2018logically loaded\u2019 sense of Section\n 1\n above.\n\nThere are various ways of defining the hybridization process depend on\nhow much generality one wants, but the following minimally general\ndefinition is the easiest to work with. Start with two (generalized)\nconsequence relations each on the same language, that language having\na single primitive connective, #, say. The hybrid connective is then #\nas it behaves according to the intersection of the (generalized)\nconsequence relations. This way of defining things requires us to\nre-notate the connectives to be hybridized. Thus sticking with the\nexample just mentioned, we consider a copy of the pure \u2227 fragment\nof \u22a2CL, called \u22a2\u2227 earlier\nin this section, but writing # for \u2227\u2014but let us still call\nthis consequence relation \u22a2\u2227\u2014and similarly\nwith the \u2228 fragment. We are then interested in the behaviour of #\naccording to \u22a2\u2227 \u2229 \u22a2\u2228.\n(Where V\u2227 and V\u2228 are\nthe classes of valuations on which # is associated respectively with\nthe Boolean \u2227 truth-function and with the Boolean \u2228\ntruth-function, our intersective consequence relation is that\ndetermined by V\u2227 \u222a\nV\u2228.) This behaviour includes the semilattice\nproperties of idempotence, commutativity and associativity, for\nexample, since these are common to Boolean disjunction and\nconjunction. This particular hybrid connective is partially\ndetermined, since for example \u03c6, \u03c8 \u227b\n\u03c6 # \u03c8 (a sequent formulation of the condition induced\non consequence relations by \u27e8T, T,\nT\u27e9) belongs to \u22a2\u2227\n\u2229 \u22a2\u2228. This by itself does not show that\nthe hybrid is not fully determined, however, and to avoid\nentanglement with some issues about rules, this point is best\nillustrated in terms of the corresponding generalized consequence\nrelations and their intersection, the latter satisfying neither of the\nconditions induced by the determinants beginning T, F: for \u27e8T, F,\nT\u27e9, the condition that \u03c6, \u03c6 # \u03c8 \u22a9 \u03c8\n(failing for # as \u2228) or the determinant \u27e8T, F, F\u27e9, for\nwhich the induced condition is \u03c6 \u22a9 \u03c6 #\n\u03c8, \u03c8 (failing for # as \u2227). (Among issues about\nnon-zero-premiss sequent-to-sequent rules that call for care is the\nfact that while for any such rule under which each of the intersected\nconsequence relations is closed, their intersection is likewise\nclosed, the converse is false: the hybrid consequence relation may be\nclosed under rules under which the originals are not. In the present\ninstance the rule: from \u03c6 \u227b \u03c8 to \u03c8\n\u227b \u03c6 is an example. Similarly for generalized consequence\nrelations the rule: from \u0393 \u227b \u0394 to\n\u0394 \u227b \u0393 makes the same point. This second version\nshows that the current example of hybridization, as conducted in Set-Set,\nyields a symmetric\ngeneralized consequence\n relation.[11])\n\nLet us note in view of the recent reference to \u22a2\u2227\n\u2229\n\u22a2\u2228, there has been an interest in how one\nmight form something like the union rather than the intersection of\nthe two consequence relations involved here. Not quite the union,\nsince that would not be a consequence relation, but something\nanswering to the intuitive idea of a consequence relation embodying\nthe combined logic of conjunction and disjunction. (This is the theme\nof B\u00e9ziau and Coniglio (2010), further taken up in Humberstone\n(2015).) The situation is not exactly dual to that of hybrids, to\nwhich topic we return in the folowing paragraph, because the envisaged\nhybrid logic contains one connective with the common logical\nproperties of (in the present instance) conjunction and disjunction,\nwhereas the combined logic is based on the language with the two\nconnectives. (The precise dual would be a consequence relation on a\nlanguage with a single connective, roughly speaking giving that\nconnective all the logical powers possessed by either disjunction or\nconjunction, and by a result of Wolfgang Rautenberg cited below,\naccording to this consequence relation any formula follows from any\nother. Indeed, this particular instance of Rautenberg\u2019s\nobservation is already well known in the literature on Tonk,\nrecalled in \u00a73 below: any consequence\nrelation in a language including a binary connective which satisfies,\nrelative to that consequence relation, both an \u2228-Introduction\ncondition and also an \u2227-Elimination condition will be one of these\ntrivial consequence relations.\n\nThe hybrid of two fully determined connectives may even be completely\nundetermined (satisfy no determinant-induced conditions at all, that\nis). This will be the case, for example, if we hybridize not\nconjunction and disjunction, but conjunction and negated conjunction\n(sometimes called nand). By using negation in this way, we\nprevent any overlap in the determinant-induced conditions which are\nsatisfied by the hybrid, though there still remain some non-trivial\nproperties (commutativity, for example) as well as\nextensionality\u2014the point of this mention of hybrids\u2014since\nany hybrid of fully determined connectives will still be extensional\n(according to the intersection, that is). Of course, one can also\nhybridize connectives which are not themselves fully, or even\npartially determined\u2014for example, one could investigate the\ncommon properties of \u2610 and \u2662 according to the smallest\nnormal modal logic (commonly called K), though this example\nwould for its most natural development require us to go beyond the\nsimple account of hybrids given here, since it would have to attend to\nthe simultaneous presence of the Boolean connectives alongside these\nmodal operators. A better known modal example of hybrids is that of\nthe \u2610 operator in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s \u0141-modal logic\n(not that \u0141ukasiewicz used this notation for his necessity\noperator), which is a hybrid of 1-ary connectives for the 1-place\nidentity and constant-false truth-functions. (See Chapter 1 of Prior\n(1957) on this point; further references may be found in Section\n 5.)\n\nThe hybrid of two connectives is a subconnective of each of\nthem in the sense that whatever sequents (of the logical framework in\nplay) are provable for it are provable for them. And\nconversely\u2014but for the moment the subconnective relation itself\nwill be the focus of attention. Intuitionistic negation is in this\nsense a subconnective, indeed a proper subconnective (in the\nsense that we do not have the converse) of classical negation. As with\nhybrids, there are various options, of differing degrees of generality\nin their application, for defining this relation. In the case of a\nlanguage with only a single primitive connective, #, we can say that #\nas it behaves according to (e.g.) the consequence relation \u22a2 is\na subconnective of # as it behaves according to \u22a2\u2032 just in\ncase \u22a2 \u2286 \u22a2\u2032. If we want to allow different\nconnectives of the same arity, say # and #\u2032, then we can put\nthis instead by saying that \u03c3(#) \u2208 \u22a2 only if\n\u03c3(#\u2032) \u2208 \u22a2\u2032, for all \u03c3(#),\nunderstanding the latter to denote a sequent with various occurrences\nof # in its constituent formulas, with \u03c3(#\u2032) the result of\nreplacing all such occurrences by #\u2032. This kind of formulation\nlends itself to wider applicability since we can allow other\nconnectives in the formulas of \u03c3(#), provided these are in the\nlanguage of \u22a2\u2032. There is no reason to restrict attention\nto primitive connectives in making such comparisons. For example, each\nof \u2610 and \u2610\u2610 is a subconnective of the other in\nseveral well-known modal logics, as is shown in Zolin (2000), where\nlogics are developed axiomatically as sets of formulas (sequents of\nthe logical framework Fmla, as we would\n say[12])\n so the \u201c\u03c3(#)\u201d would become \u201c\u03c6(#)\u201d\nand the point is that in the logics concerned \u03c6(\u2610) and\n\u03c6(\u2610\u2610) are always equi-provable\u2014though in the\ninteresting cases (e.g., those of K, KT, KTB),\nnot provably equivalent. Note that this is an intra-logical\napplication of the subconnective idea (corresponding to the case of\n\u22a2 = \u22a2\u2032 above, for which we definitely need\nto work with notationally distinguished # and #\u2032). Zolin calls\nsuch mutual subconnectives analogous (\u2018analogous\nmodalities\u2019). A philosophically famous example of this\nphenomenon from bimodal (or more specifically, doxastic-epistemic)\nlogic was reported in Byrd (1973).\n\nEarlier in this section we saw that, where\nVf and Vg\nare the classes of valuations for a language with n-ary\nconnective # on which distinct truth-functions f and\ng are associated with # respectively, the consequence\nrelations determined by Vf and\nVg were always distinct. In the present\nterminology, this means that either # as it behaves according to the\nfirst of these consequence relations is not a subconnective of # as it\nbehaves according to the second, or vice versa. This is obvious for\ngeneralized consequence relations as one can read off the difference\nfrom the unconditional conditions induced by the determinants of\nf and g, but we saw (in a worked example) that such\ndifferences are also guaranteed to emerge at the relatively cruder\nlevel of consequence relations. A stronger conclusion can be drawn\nfrom Theorem 4 of Rautenberg (1981) (see also Rautenberg 1985, p.\u00a04), which will not be proved here, and for the statement of which we\nneed to explain that a non-trivial consequence relation\n\u22a2 is one for which there exist formulas \u03c6, \u03c8 in the\nlanguage of \u22a2 such that \u03c6 \u22ac \u03c8; for some of the\nmatrix terminology here, see Section\n 5:\n\nLet M be any two-element matrix with one designated value. Then\nthe consequence relation \u22a8M determined by\nM is not properly included in any non-trivial\nsubstitution-invariant consequence relation on the same language.\n\n\nAs one very special case of this maximality result, in which the\nalgebra reduct of M has only a single fundamental operation\n(f, as above, say), we get a stronger conclusion about the\nconsequence relations \u22a2f and\n\u22a2g determined by\nVf and Vg\nthan our earlier conclusion that these consequence relations are\ndistinct: we get the conclusion that neither is included in the other.\nTaking the A and D of M = (A,\nD) as ({T, F}, f) and {T}, the consequence relation\n\u22a2f is what Rautenberg is calling\n\u22a8M, and if this were properly included in\n\u22a2g we should have a contradiction with the\nabove result, since the latter consequence relation is certainly\nnon-trivial and substitution-invariant. Thus informally speaking, even\nin the relatively undiscriminating framework Set-Fmla,\nthe logic of one\ntruth-function never subsumes that of another. Less informally: even\nin Set-Fmla, a fully\ndetermined connective is never a proper subconnective of another fully\ndetermined connective.\n\nWe conclude this section with two observations prompted by this\nresult. The first concerns whether anything was gained by our earlier\nlooking at the argument for the weaker result (understood in the light\nof the above conventions) to the effect that, f \u2260\ng implies \u22a2f \u2260\n\u22a2g. The answer to this question is that\nalthough the result is weaker, the proof yields something stronger:\nany difference in determinants yields a difference in unconditional\ndeterminant-induced conditions. Considered as sequents (with\npropositional variables replacing the schematic letters in the induced\nconditions) these have a very special form, and, transferring\nDummett\u2019s terminology (seen earlier in this section) for rules,\nacross to sequents, we note that they are all included in the class of\npure and simple sequents: sequents in which there is only one\nconnective to occur and it occurs only once in the sequent. Suitably\nabstracting from our earlier worked example, we can see that any\nconnectives satisfying the conditions induced by even one pair of\nopposite determinants (whether or not any remaining\ndeterminant-induced conditions are satisfied) are bound to differ on a\npair of pure and simple sequents. But the analogue of\nRautenberg\u2019s result does not hold in this form: that the set of\npure and simple sequents satisfied by the one and the set satisfied by\nthe other are incomparable with respect to inclusion. For example,\nconsider the case of the 1-ary truth-functions Boolean negation and\nthe constant-false function. We can cite #p \u22a2\nq as an example of a pure and simple sequent which holds on\nevery valuation on which 1-ary # is associated with the constant-false\nfunction but not on every valuation on which it is associated with the\nnegation function. But an inspection of possible cases reveals that\nthere is no pure and simple sequent valid for the negation\ninterpretation of # which is not also valid for the constant-false\ninterpretation. (Of course there are sequents doing this\u2014e.g.,\np \u227b ## p but, though pure, they are not\nsimple. And, yes, in Set-Set,\nwe can always find pure and simple witnesses to\nthe non-inclusion of the one logic in the other: the\ndeterminant-induced conditions on generalized consequence relations\nwill serve in this capacity.)\n\nFor the second observation, we note a more linguistic reformulation of\nRautenberg\u2019s result, for which we first need a brief digression\non defined connectives. A connective derived by composition from a set\nof primitive connectives yields a defined connective in one of two\nways, depending on one\u2019s views of definition. On one view,\nisolating the derived connective is already giving a definition: one\nhas a formula \u03c6(p1,\u2026,\npn) in which exactly the exhibited\nvariables occur, which since it is constructed from these variables\nvia the primitive connectives constitutes a derived connective,\napplying to formulas\n\u03c81,\u2026,\u2009\u03c8n to yield\nthe formula \u03c6(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\nwhich results from substituting \u03c8i\nuniformly for\npi in \u03c6(p1,\u2026,\npn). We can introduce a shorthand\nto such substitution-instances, denoting \u03c6(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\nby \u201c#(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n)\u201d,\nfor instance\u2014as in calling the formula \u00ac(\u03c81\n\u2227 \u00ac\n\u03c82) by the name \u201c\u03c81 \u2192\n\u03c82\u201d. (Of course this would only be a good idea if\nthere is nothing better to mean, or which is already meant, by\n\u2192\u2014as there would be in intuitionistic logic, for instance.)\nThat is the first view of\n definition.[13]\n On the second view, rather than just being a metalinguistic\nabbreviation, the defined connective is an addition to the object\nlanguage: we add (to continue with the example just given) a new\nprimitive connective \u2192, along with a stipulation that compounds\nof the form \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 are to be\nsynonymous with those of the corresponding form\n\u00ac(\u03c81 \u2227 \u00ac \u03c82). We need not\nchoose between these views here, but some formulations are sensitive\nto which view is taken. In particular, if we have classical logic with\nprimitives \u00ac and \u2227, we may still wish to consider its\nimplicational fragment\u2014in Set-Fmla,\nsay, where this would be the restriction of\n\u22a2CL to formulas constructed using only the\nconnective \u2192. On the first view of definition, we cannot\nliterally do that, since to use \u2192 is ipso facto to use\n\u00ac and \u2227, so what is meant is rather than the only occurrences\nof \u00ac and \u2227 are such as occur in subformulas of the form\n\u03c81 \u2192 \u03c82 in virtue of these being\nthe formulas \u00ac(\u03c81 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c82). On\nthe second view of definition, we have expanded the\nlanguage-as-algebra by adding a new fundamental operation \u2192 and\ncan now consider the subalgebra generated by the propositional\nvariables of the reduct of this algebra obtained by discarding the\nother fundamental operations.\n\nNow let \u03c61 and \u03c62 any two classically\nnon-equivalent formulas in the same variables,\np1,\u2026, pn for\ndefiniteness, and consider the consequence relations\n\u22a21 and \u22a22, where \u22a21\nis the restriction of \u22a2CL to formulas\nconstructed using the n-ary connective # defined thus:\n\n#(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n) =\n\u03c61(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n),\n\n\nand \u22a22 is the analogous restriction of\n\u22a2CL this time to the #-fragment with # defined\nby:\n\n#(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n) =\n\u03c62(\u03c81,\u2026,\u03c8n).\n\n\nSince each of \u03c61 and \u03c62 fixes an\nn-ary truth-function of the variables involved, and these\ntruth-functions are distinct (since \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 were to be non-equivalent) the above\nVf\u2009/\u2009Vg\napplication of Rautenberg\u2019s result tells us that neither of\n\u22a21, \u22a22, is included in the other.\nConcentrating on the connectives involved, we can put this by saying\nthat in classical logic any two non-equivalent connectives are\nincomparable with respect to the subconnective relation (understood as\nrelating the consequence relations on languages in which no further\nconnectives appear). We close by observing that the analogous claim\nwould be false for intuitionistic logic. A counterexample is provided\nby the connectives defined by \u03c6 #1\n\u03c8 = \u00ac\u03c6\u2228 \u00ac\u03c8 and \u03c6\n#2 \u03c8 = \u00ac(\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c8). These are\nintuitionistically non-equivalent, in the sense of not always yielding\n\u22a2I\u2009L-equivalent compounds from the same\ncomponents, while\u2014by an argument not given here\u2014for any\nintuitionistically provable sequent \u03c3(#1) involving\nformulas constructed from the variables by means of #1, the\ncorresponding sequent \u03c3(#2) is also\nintuitionistically provable (though not conversely). So, by contrast\nwith what can happen in the classical setting, we have non-equivalent\nconnectives one of which is a proper subconnective of the\nother\u2014understanding this last phrase subject to the same\nparenthetical qualification as above.\n",
