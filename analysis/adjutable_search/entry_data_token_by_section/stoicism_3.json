Physical Theory\n\nStoic physical theory included topics traditionally covered by natural\nphilosophy, and it is where the Stoics developed their ontology and\nmetaphysics. As is to be expected of their systematic approach to\nphilosophy, much of Stoic physics is fundamental in underpinning their\nviews in ethics and also interacts with some of their logic and\nphilosophy of language.\n",
