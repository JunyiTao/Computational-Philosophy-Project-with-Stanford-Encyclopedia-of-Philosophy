    "main_text": "\n\nThe philosophical investigation of human death has focused on two\noverarching questions: (1) What is human death? and (2) How can we\ndetermine that it has occurred? The first question is ontological or\nconceptual. An answer to this question will consist of a\ndefinition (or conceptualization). Examples include\ndeath as the irreversible cessation of organismic functioning\nand human death as the irreversible loss of personhood. The\nsecond question is epistemological. A complete answer to this question\nwill furnish both a general standard (or criterion)\nfor determining that death has occurred and specific clinical\ntests to show whether the standard has been met in a given case.\nExamples of standards for human death are the traditional\ncardiopulmonary standard and the whole-brain\nstandard. Insofar as clinical tests are primarily a medical\nconcern, the present entry will address them only in passing.\n\nThe philosophical issues concerning the correct definition and\nstandard for human death are closely connected to other questions. How\ndoes the death of human beings relate to the death of other living\nthings? Is human death simply an instance of organismic death,\nultimately a matter of biology? If not, on what basis should it be\ndefined? Whatever the answers to these questions, does death or at\nleast human death have an essence\u2014either de re or\nde dicto\u2014entailing necessary and jointly sufficient\nconditions? Or do the varieties of death reveal only \u201cfamily\nresemblance\u201d relations? Are life and death exhaustive categories\nof those things that are ever animated, or do some individuals fall\ninto an ontological neutral zone between life and death? Finally, how\ndo our deaths relate, conceptually, to our essence and identity as\nhuman persons?\n\nFor the most part, such questions did not clamor for public attention\nuntil well into the twentieth century. (For historical background, see\nPernick 1999 and Capron 1999, 120\u2013124.) Sufficient destruction\nof the brain, including the brainstem, ensured respiratory failure\nleading quickly to terminal cardiac arrest. Conversely, prolonged\ncardiopulmonary failure inevitably led to total, irreversible loss of\nbrain function. With the invention of mechanical respirators in the\n1950s, however, it became possible for a previously lethal extent of\nbrain damage to coexist with continued cardiopulmonary functioning,\nsustaining the functioning of other organs. Was such a patient alive\nor dead? The widespread dissemination in the 1960s of such\ntechnologies as mechanical respirators and defibrillators to restore\ncardiac function highlighted the possibility of separating\ncardiopulmonary and neurological functioning. Quite rapidly the\nquestions of what constituted human death and how we could determine\nits occurrence had emerged as issues both philosophically rich and\nurgent.\n\nVarious practical concerns provided further impetus for addressing\nthese issues. (Reflecting these concerns is a landmark 1968 report\npublished by a Harvard Medical School committee led by physician Henry\nBeecher (Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School 1968).)\nSoaring medical expenditures provoked concerns about prolonged,\npossibly futile treatment of patients who presented some but not all\nof the traditionally recognized indicators of death. Certainly, it\nwould be permissible to discontinue life-supports if these patients\nwere dead. Concurrent interest in the evolving techniques of organ\ntransplantation motivated physicians not to delay unnecessarily in\ndetermining that a patient had died. Removing vital organs as quickly\nas possible would improve the prospect of saving lives. But removing\nvital organs of living patients would cause their deaths, violating\nboth laws against homicide and the widely accepted moral principle\nprohibiting the intentional killing of innocent human beings (see the\nentry on\n doing vs. allowing harm).\n To be sure, there were\u2014as there are now\u2014individuals who\nheld that procuring organs from, thereby killing, irreversibly\nunconscious patients who had consented to donate is a legitimate\nexception to this moral principle (see the entry on\n voluntary euthanasia),\n but this judgment strikes many as a radical departure from common\nmorality. In any event, in view of concerns about the possibility of\nkilling in the course of organ procurement, physicians wanted clear\nlegal guidance for determining when someone had died.\n\nThe remainder of this entry takes a dialectical form, focusing\nprimarily on ideas and arguments rather than on history and\nindividuals. It begins with an approach that nearly achieved consensus\nstatus after these issues came under the spotlight in the twentieth\ncentury: the whole-brain approach. (Most of what are here\nreferred to as \u201capproaches\u201d include a standard and a\ncorresponding definition of death; a few offer more radical\nsuggestions for how to understand human death.) The discussion\nproceeds, in turn, to the higher-brain approach, to an\nupdated cardiopulmonary approach, and to several more radical\napproaches. The discussion of each approach examines its chief\nassertions, its answers to questions identified above, leading\narguments in its favor, and its chief difficulties. The entry as a\nwhole is intended to identify the main philosophical issues connected\nwith the definition and determination of human death, leading\napproaches that have been developed to address these issues, and\nprincipal strengths and difficulties of these visions viewed as\ncompetitors.\n",
