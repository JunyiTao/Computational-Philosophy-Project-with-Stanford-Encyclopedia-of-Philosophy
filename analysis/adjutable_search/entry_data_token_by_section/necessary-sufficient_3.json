    "main_text": "Inferences, Reasons for Thinking, and Reasons Why\n4. Inferences, Reasons for Thinking, and Reasons Why\n\nAre the following two statements equivalent? (Wertheimer 1968,\n363\u20134):\n\nThe occurrence of a sea battle tomorrow is a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the truth, today, of \u201cThere will be a\nsea battle tomorrow.\u201d\nThe truth, today, of \u201cThere will be a sea battle\ntomorrow\u201d is a necessary and sufficient condition for the\noccurrence of a sea battle tomorrow.\n\n\nDavid Sanford argues that while (vii) is sensible, (viii) \u201chas\nthings backward\u201d (Sanford 1989, 176\u20137). He writes:\n\u201cthe statement about the battle, if true, is true because of the\noccurrence of the battle. The battle does not occur because of the\ntruth of the statement\u201d (ibid.) What he may mean is\nthat the occurrence of the battle gives a reason why the\nstatement is true, but it is not conversely the case that the truth of\nthe statement provides any reason why the battle occurred. Of course,\npeople sometimes do undertake actions just to make true what they had\nformerly said; so there will be unusual cases where the truth of a\nstatement is a reason why an event occurred. But this seems an\nunlikely reading of the sea battle case.\n\nNow let S be the sentence \u201cThere will be a sea battle\ntomorrow\u201d. If S is true today, it is correct to infer\nthat a sea battle will occur tomorrow. That is, even though the truth\nof the sentence does not explain the occurrence of the battle, the\nfact that it is true licenses the inference to the occurrence of the\nevent. Ascending to the purely formal mode (see section 4 of the entry\non\n Rudolf Carnap),\n we can make the point by explicitly limiting inference relations to\nones that hold among sentences or other bearers of truth values. It is\nperfectly proper to infer from the truth of S today that some\nother sentence is true tomorrow, such as \u201cthere is a sea battle\ntoday\u201d. Since \u201cthere is a sea battle today\u201d is true\ntomorrow if and only if there is a sea battle tomorrow, then we can\ninfer from the fact that S is true today that it is true that\na sea battle will occur tomorrow.\n\nFrom this observation, it would appear that there is a gap between\nwhat is true of inferences, and what is true of \u201creason\nwhy\u201d relations. There is an inferential sense in which the truth\nof S is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the\noccurrence of the sea battle. However, there is an explanatory sense\nin which the occurrence of the sea battle is necessary and sufficient\nfor the truth of S, but not vice versa. It would\nappear that in cases like (vii) and (viii) the inferences run in both\ndirections, while explanatory reasons run only one way. Whether we\nread (vii) as equivalent to (viii) seems to depend on the sense in\nwhich the notions of necessary and sufficient conditions are being\ndeployed.\n\nIs it possible to generalize this finding? The door example ((i)\nabove) seems to be a case in point. The fact I used the key gives a\nreason why I was able to open the door without force. That I opened\nthe door without force gives a ground for inferring that I used the\nkey. Here is a further example from McCawley:\n\nIf Audrey wins the race, we will celebrate.\n\n\nAudrey\u2019s winning the race is a sufficient condition for us\nhaving a celebration, and her winning the race is the reason why we\nwill be celebrating. Our celebration, however, is not likely to be the\nreason why she wins the race. In what sense then is the celebration a\nnecessary condition of her winning the race? Again, there is a ground\nfor inferring: that we don\u2019t celebrate is a ground for inferring\nthat Audrey didn\u2019t win the race. English time reference appears\nsensitive to the asymmetry uncovered here, in the way noted in the\nprevious section. The natural way of writing the contrapositive of\n(ix) is not the literal \u201cIf we will not celebrate, then Audrey\ndoes not win the race\u201d, but rather something like:\n\nIf we don\u2019t celebrate, Audrey didn\u2019t win the\nrace.\n\n\nor\n\nIf we aren\u2019t celebrating, Audrey hasn\u2019t won the\nrace.\n\n\nor even\n\nIf we don\u2019t celebrate, Audrey can\u2019t have won the\nrace.\n\n\nGilberto Gomes (Gomes 2019) discusses in detail a range of cases in\nwhich sometimes elaborate paraphrasing of this, and other, kinds can\nbe used to preserve reciprocity between conditionals and their\ncontrapositives.\n\nIan Wilson (in Wilson 1979) proposes that there are five possible\nrelations symbolised by \u201cif, \u2026 then \u2026\u201d\nincluding the reason why reading. Subsequent authors have not\nadopted this proposal, preferring to focus mainly on three of these\nrelations, each of which bears on questions of necessity and\nsufficiency. First is the implication relation symbolised by the hook\noperator, \u201c\u2283\u201d or perhaps some relevant implication\noperator. Such an operator captures some inferential relations as\nalready noted. For example, we saw that from the truth of a\nconjunction, it can be inferred that each component is true (from\n\u201cp and q\u201d, we can infer that\n\u201cp\u201d is true and that \u201cq\u201d is\ntrue). Hook, or a relevant implication operator, seems to capture one\nof the relations encountered in the sea battle case, a relation which\ncan be thought of as holding paradigmatically between bearers of truth\nvalues, but can also be thought of in terms of states of affairs. For\nthis relation, we are able to maintain the standard theory\u2019s\nreciprocity thesis with the limitations already noted.\n\nTwo further relations, however, are often implicated in reflections on\nnecessary and sufficient conditions. To identify these, consider the\ndifferent things that can be meant by saying\n\nIf Solange was present, it was a good seminar.\n\n\nOne scenario for (xiii) is the situation where Solange is invariably a\nlively contributor to any seminar she attends. Moreover, the\ncontributions she makes are always insightful, hence guaranteeing an\ninteresting time for all who attend. In this case, Solange\u2019s\npresence at least in part explains or is a reason why the\nseminar was good. Note that some writers distinguish explanatory\nreasons of this sort from full-bodied explanations (Nebel 2018). A\ndifferent scenario depicts Solange as someone who has an almost\nunerring knack for spotting which seminars are going to be good, even\nthough she is not always active in the discussion. Her attendance at a\nseminar, according to this story, provides a reason for\nthinking\u2014or is evidence\u2014that the seminar is\ngood. We might say that according to the first story, the seminar is\ngood because Solange is at it. In the second case, Solange is at it\nbecause it is good. Examples of this kind were first introduced in\nWilson (1979) following on from the attack on the validity of\ncontraposition in Downing (1975). Notice that the hook (as understood\nin classical logic) does not capture the reason for thinking\nrelation, for it permits any true consequent to be inferred from any\nother statement whatever. Where the conditional is a reason for\nthinking relation, then the antecedent must provide some support\nfor the consequent\u2014hence has to provide some supporting evidence\nfor accepting the consequent. A formal exploration of one reason\nfor thinking relation is given in Vincenzo Crupi and Andrea\nIacona\u2019s study of the evidential conditional (Crupi and\nIacona 2020, and see the fully developed logic of the evidential\nconditional in Raidl, Iacona and Crupi 2021). These writers treat the\nreason for thinking or evidentiary relation as one in which\nthe antecedent provides a \u201creason for accepting\u201d the\nconsequent. See also Igor Douven on the \u201cevidential support\nthesis\u201d (Douven 2008, 2016). \n\nThe reason why and reason for thinking that\nconditions may help to shed light on the peculiarities encountered\nearlier. That I opened the door is a reason for thinking that I used\nthe key, not a reason why. In case (iii) above, that he learns to play\nthe instrument is the reason why I will buy Lambert a cello, and that\nI buy him a cello is (in the same case) a reason for thinking\nthat\u2014but not a reason why\u2014he has learned to play the\ninstrument. Our celebrating is a reason for thinking that Audrey has\nwon the race in case (ix), but is unlikely to be a reason why.\n\nAlthough there is sometimes a correlation between reasons why, on the\none hand, and evidentiary relations, on the other, few generalisations\nabout this can be safely made. If A is a reason why\nB has occurred (and so perhaps also is evidence that\nB has occurred), then the occurrence of B will\nsometimes be a reason for thinking\u2014but not a\nguarantee\u2014that A has occurred. If A is no more\nthan a reason for thinking that B has occurred, then\nB will sometimes be a reason why\u2014but not a guarantee\nthat\u2014A has occurred. Going back to example (i) above,\nmy opening the door (without violence) was a reason for thinking, that\nis to say evidence, that I had used the key. That I used the key,\nhowever, was not just a reason for thinking that I had opened the\ndoor, but one of the reasons why I was able to open the door. What is\nimportant is that the \u201cif\u201d clause of a conditional may do\nany of three things described in the present section. One of these is\nwell captured by classical truth-functional logic, namely (i)\nintroduce a sentence from which the consequent follows in the way\nmodelled by an operator such as hook. But there are two other jobs\nthat \u201cif\u201d may do as well, namely: (ii) state a reason why\nwhat is stated in the consequent is the case; (iii) state a reason for\nthinking that what is stated in the consequent is the case even when\nthis is not a reason why.\n\nIn general, if explanation is directional, it may not seem surprising\nthat when A explains B, it is not usually the case\nthat B, or its negation, is in turn an explanation of\nA (or its negation). Audrey\u2019s winning the race explains\nour celebration, but our failure to celebrate is not (normally) a\nplausible explanation of her failure to win. Solange\u2019s presence\nmay explain why the seminar was such a great success, but a boring\nseminar is not\u2014in any normal set of circumstances\u2014a reason\nwhy Solange is not at it. This result seems to undermine the usual\nunderstanding that if A is a sufficient condition of\nB, it will typically be the case that B is a\nnecessary condition for A, and the falsity of B a\nsufficient condition for the falsity of A.\n\nIn defence of contraposition, it might be argued that in the case of\ncausal claims there is at least a weak form of contraposition that is\nvalid. Gomes proposes (Gomes 2009) that where \u2018A\u2019\nis claimed to be a causally sufficient condition for\n\u2018B\u2019, or \u2018B\u2019 a causally\nnecessary condition of \u2018A\u2019, then some form of\nreciprocity between the two kinds of conditions holds, and so some\nversion of contraposition will be valid. Going back to example (ii),\nsuppose we read this as stating a causal condition\u2014that your\ntouching me would cause me to scream. Gomes suggests that\n\u2018A\u2019 denotes a sufficient cause of B,\nprovided that (1) \u2018A\u2019 specifies the occurrence of\nan event that would cause another event \u2018B\u2019, and\ndoes this by (2) stating a condition the truth of which is sufficient\nfor inferring the truth of \u2018B\u2019. In such a case,\nwe could further maintain that \u2018B\u2019, in turn,\ndenotes a necessary effect of \u2018A\u2019, meaning that\nthe truth of B provides a necessary condition for the truth\nof A (Gomes 2009, 377\u20139). It is notable that Crupi and\nIacona\u2019s evidential conditional also preserves contraposition,\nwhich they claim as a distinctive feature of of their analysis, based\non their understanding that \u201cprovides evidence for\u201d is\nanother way of saying \u201csupports\u201d (section 6 of Crupi and\nIacona 2020). For them, if Solange\u2019s presence provides evidence\nfor the seminar being good (see (xiii) above), then the\nseminar\u2019s not being good is evidence of Solange\u2019s absence.\nThey\u2014like Gomes (2019)\u2014thus reject Downing\u2019s (1975)\ngeneral scepticism about contraposition. Wilson, by contrast, argues\nthat the seminar not being good might also be a reason why Solange\ndoes not attend. But this, he claims, \u201csaves only the appearance\nof contraposition\u201d (Wilson 1979, 274\u20135).\n\nWhile it is possible to distinguish these different roles the\n\u201cif\u201d clause may play (there may be others too), it is not\nalways easy to isolate them in every case. The appeal to\n\u201creasons why\u201d and \u201creasons for thinking\u201d\nenables us to identify what seem to be ambiguities both in the word\n\u201cif\u201d and in the terminology of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. Unfortunately, the concept of what is explanatory\nitself may be too vague to be very helpful here, for we can explain a\nphenomenon by citing a reason for thinking it is the case, or by\nciting a reason why it is the case. A similar vagueness infests the\nword \u201cbecause\u201d, as we see below. Consider, for example,\ncases where mathematical, physical or other laws are involved (one\nlocus classicus for this issue is Sellars 1948). The truth of\n\u201cthat figure is a polygon\u201d is sufficient for inferring\n\u201cthe sum of that figure\u2019s exterior angles is 360\ndegrees\u201d. Likewise, from \u201cthe sum of the figure\u2019s\nexterior angles is not 360 degrees\u201d we can infer \u201cthe\nfigure is not a polygon\u201d. Such inferences are not trivial.\nRather they depend on geometrical definitions and mathematical\nprinciples, and so this is a case of mathematically necessary and\nsufficient conditions. But it appears quite plausible that\nmathematical results also give us at least a reason for thinking that\nbecause a figure is a polygon its exterior angles will sum to 360\ndegrees. We may even be able to think of contexts in which someone\nclaims that a figure\u2019s being a polygon is a reason why its\nexterior angles sum to 360 degrees. And it might not be unnatural for\nsomeone to remark that a certain figure is a polygon because its\nexterior angles sum to 360 degrees.\n\nA similar point holds for the theory of knowledge where it is\ngenerally held that if I know that p, then p is true\n(see the entry on\n the analysis of knowledge).\n The truth of p is a necessary condition of knowing that\np, according to such accounts. In saying this we do not rule\nout claims stronger than simply saying that the truth of p\nfollows from the fact that we know that p. That a belief is\ntrue\u2014for example\u2014may be (part of) a reason for thinking it\nconstitutes knowledge. Other cases involve inferences licensed by\nphysics, biology and the natural sciences\u2014inferences that will\ninvolve causal or nomic conditions. Again there is need for care in\ndetermining whether reason why or reason for\nthinking relations are being stated. The increase of mean kinetic\nenergy of its molecules does not just imply that the temperature of a\ngas is rising but also provides a reason why the temperature is\nincreasing. However, if temperature is just one way of measuring mean\nmolecular kinetic energy, then a change in temperature will be a\nreason for thinking that mean kinetic energy of molecules has changed,\nnot a reason why it has changed.\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the article, the specification of\nnecessary and sufficient conditions has traditionally been part of the\nphilosopher\u2019s business of analysis of terms, concepts and\nphenomena. Philosophical investigations of knowledge, truth,\ncausality, consciousness, memory, justice, altruism and a host of\nother matters do not aim at stating evidential or explanatory\nrelations, but rather at identifying and developing conceptual ones\n(see Jackson 1998 for a detailed account of conceptual analysis, and\nthe supplementary entry on\n conceptions of analysis in analytic philosophy\n for an overview). But even here, the temptation to look for\nreasons why or reasons for thinking that is not far\naway. While conceptual analysis, like dictionary definition, eschews\nevidential and explanatory conditions, evidential conditions seem to\nbe natural consequences of definition and analysis. That Nellie is an\nelephant may not be a (or the) reason why she is an animal, any more\nthan that a figure is a square is a reason why it has four sides. But\nsome evidential claims seem to make sense even in such contexts: being\nan elephant apparently gives a reason for thinking that Nellie is an\nanimal, and a certain figure may be said to have four sides because it\nis a square, in an evidential sense of \u201cbecause\u201d.\n\nTo specify the necessary conditions for the truth of the sentence\n\u201cthat figure is a square\u201d is to specify a number of\nconditions including \u201cthat figure has four sides\u201d,\n\u201cthat figure is on a plane\u201d, and \u201cthat figure is\nclosed\u201d. If any one of these latter conditions is false, then\nthe sentence \u201cthat figure is a square\u201d is also false.\nConversely, the truth of \u201cthat figure is a square\u201d is a\nsufficient condition for the truth of \u201cthat figure is\nclosed\u201d. The inferential relations in this case are\nmodelled\u2014even if inadequately\u2014by an operator such as\nhook.\n\nNow consider a previous example\u2014that of memory. That Penelope\nremembers something\u2014according to a standard account of\nmemory\u2014means (among other things) that the thing remembered was\nin the past, and that some previous episode involving Penelope plays\nan appropriate causal role in her present recall of the thing in\nquestion. It would be a mistake to infer from the causal role of some\npast episode in Penelope\u2019s current remembering, that the\ndefinition of memory itself involves conditions that are explanatory\nin the reason why sense. That Penelope now remembers some\nevent is not a reason why it is in the past. Nor is it a reason for\nthinking that it is in the past. Rather, philosophical treatments of\nmemory seek for conditions that are a priori constitutive of\nthe truth of such sentences as \u201cPenelope remembers doing\nX\u201d. The uncovering of such conditions simply provides\ninsight into whether, and how, \u201cremember\u201d is to be\ndefined. Reason why and reason for thinking that\nconditions seem not to play a role in this part of the\nphilosopher\u2019s enterprise.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that not all conditional sentences\nprimarily aim at giving either necessary or sufficient conditions. A\ncommon case involves what might be called jocular\nconditionals. A friend of Octavia\u2019s mistakenly refers to\n\u201cPlato\u2019s Critique of Pure Reason\u201d and\nOctavia says, \u201cIf Plato wrote the Critique of Pure\nReason, then I\u2019m Aristotle\u201d. Rather than specifying\nconditions, Octavia is engaging in a form of reductio\nargument. Since it is obvious that she is not Aristotle, her joke\ninvites the listener to infer (by contraposition) that Plato did not\nwrite the Critique of Pure Reason. Another case is the\nso-called concessive conditional, where the antecedent does\nnot appear to be a condition on the consequent of even an inferential\nkind. Suppose we plan on having picnic and hope it will be sunny. But\neven if rain comes, we will still go. In such a case it does\nnot seem plausible to maintain that the threat of rain provides any\ncondition at all on accepting the consequent. Such concessive\nconditionals do not admit of contraposition (Crupi and Iacona 2022,\nand compare Gomes 2020). Others have argued that in cases where a\nconditional construction does not appear to be putting forward any\ngenuine conditions, these are \u201cnonconditional\u201d\nconditionals (Geis and Lycan 1993)\u2014in other words they may just\nbe disguised affirmations.\n",
