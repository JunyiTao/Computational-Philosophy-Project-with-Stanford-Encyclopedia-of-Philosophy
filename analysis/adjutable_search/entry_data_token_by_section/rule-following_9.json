    "main_text": "Reductive Dispositionalism\n5. Non-Reductionism\n\nThe apparently very serious problems we outlined for the\ndispositionalist conception of meaning have been taken by a number of\nphilosophers to show that we ought to resist the temptation to explain\nmeaning and content in more basic terms. How might one formulate a\nnon-reductionist position? On Stroud\u2019s view, it amounts to\ndenying that we can explain \n\n\nthe phenomena of meaning and understanding \u201cfrom outside\u201d\nthem, as it were, without attributing intentional attitudes or\nsupposing that anything means anything or is understood in a certain\nway to those whose understanding is being accounted for. (Stroud 2000:\nviii) \n\n\nMore generally, we might say that the facts constitutive of the\nsemantic domain cannot be characterised or explained in non-semantic\nterms, that is, without employing the notions of meaning or\nunderstanding; the facts constitutive of rule-following cannot be\ncharacterised or explained without employing the notion of\nrule-following. Some philosophers who embrace non-reductionism also\ndefend the view according to which semantic facts do not supervene on\nanything; they are metaphysically fundamental. Boghossian relies on\nthe finitude problem to argue that, if meaning facts are determinate,\nthen they cannot supervene on non-semantic facts (Boghossian 2015).\nHowever, the denial of supervenience is not essential to\nnon-reductionism (cf. Child 2019b): at the core of the position is the\nidea that any attempt to account for meaning in more basic terms is\nhopeless or philosophically confused.\n\nKripke briefly considers the possibility that the states of meaning or\nunderstanding, or the facts about meaning and understanding, are\nprimitive or sui generis, which he cashes out as the idea\nthat \n\n\nmeaning addition by \u201cplus\u201d \u2026 is simply a primitive\nstate, not to be assimilated to sensations or headaches or any\n\u201cqualitative\u201d states, nor to be assimilated to\ndispositions, but a state of a unique kind of its own. (1982: 51) \n\n\nHe raises two complaints against this approach. First, he\ncharacterizes it as desperate, insofar as \u201cit leaves the nature\nof this postulated primitive state \u2026 completely\nmysterious\u201d (1982: 51), for such an approach does not provide an\naccount of what makes it possible for one to \u201cbe confident that\n[one] does, at present\u201d mean what one does (1982: 51).\nSecond, he thinks that a non-reductionist account does not address the\n\u201clogical difficulty implicit in Wittgenstein\u2019s sceptical\nargument\u201d (1982: 51), which is that it would seem that we could\nnot \u201cconceive of a finite state which could not be\ninterpreted in a quus-like way\u201d (1982: 52).\n\nSome philosophers claim that Kripke\u2019s treatment of the\nnon-reductionist position is unsatisfactory. McGinn, who appears to\nignore Kripke\u2019s brief discussion of non-reductionism, thinks\nthat there is an \n\n\nundefended and undisclosed premise [in the sceptic\u2019s argument],\nnamely that semantic discourse cannot be regarded as\nirreducible. (1984:\n 82)[15]\n\n\n\nMcGinn also notes that Kripke has no qualms with adopting a\nnon-reductionist view of meaning in other works\u2014see, for\ninstance, Kripke 1972: 94\u201397. Goldfarb thinks that \u201cthe\nconception Kripke exploits is basically physicalistic\u201d (1985\n[2002: 95]), and thus that pursuing a non-physicalist approach\nhasn\u2019t been ruled out. Boghossian thinks that what Kripke needs\nfor his treatment of non-reductionism to succeed is an argument from\nqueerness aiming to show that there is something inherently queer\nabout meaning properties, which he fails to provide (1989 [2002: 180];\ncf. Hattiangadi 2007: 47\u201350). Ultimately, Boghossian is\nsympathetic to the non-reductionist approach, though he thinks that\n\u201cit really is not plausible\u201d that such a conception might\nbe true of linguistic meaning (1989 [2002: 179]); on his view, it is\nfacts about mental content that are irreducible.\n\nBefore exploring several of the non-reductionist positions proposed in\nrecent years, we should note that some of the proponents of\nnon-reductionism think that Kripke\u2019s sceptical challenge is\nbased on confusion, and that our task is to unearth that confusion.\nThus, on their view, the proper response is not to solve the\nsceptical problem by showing that the sceptic failed properly to\nacknowledge some set of facts (or some features of some such facts),\nbut to dissolve it by showing that there is, in fact, no\nproblem. McDowell, for instance, argues that Kripke misunderstands the\ndialectic pursued by Wittgenstein in Philosophical\nInvestigations. On his view, \n\n\nthe right response to the paradox, Wittgenstein in effect tells us, is\nnot to accept it but to correct the misunderstanding on which it\ndepends, (1984 [1998: 229]) \n\n\nwhich puts us in a position to dissolve the paradox and, with it, the\nproblem of how meaning is possible. This involves renouncing the\nproblematic assumption that understanding an expression requires\ninterpreting that expression. McDowell\u2019s diagnosis isn\u2019t\nconfined to linguistic expressions. What we ought to resist is the\nthought that, \n\n\nwhatever is in a person\u2019s mind at any time, it needs\ninterpretation if it is to sort items outside the mind into those that\nare in accord with it and those that are not. (1992 [1998: 268]) \n\n\nSimilarly, Stroud thinks that the paradox is \u201can expression of\nan unsatisfiable demand\u201d (1990 [2000: 88]), namely, the demand\nfor \n\n\nsome facts, the recognition of which would not require that we already\nspeak and understand a language, and some rules, which would tell us\nwhat, given those facts, it was correct to say. \n\n\nSuch facts and such rules would have to be such as to \u201cserve to\nget us into language in the first place\u201d (Stroud 1990b [2000:\n94]). The demand is most strongly manifested in Kripke\u2019s\nassumption that there must be an item that instructs or tells the\nspeaker what to do with her expressions. Stroud claims that proper\nengagement with Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks reveals this assumption\nto be misguided, for it embarks us on a regress (Stroud 1996 [2000:\n180\u2013185]). Once we recognize the misguidedness of the picture\nthat Kripke assumes, we will no longer feel the force of the sceptical\nchallenge, Stroud thinks. However, contra Stroud, it seems that the\nextensionality condition is all we need in order to pose a\nstripped-down version of the question that the sceptic is raising,\nnamely, the question of what makes the standards of correctness that\ngovern our uses of expressions and our deployments of concepts\npossible.\n\nIt might be argued that the urgency of this question, or even its very\nintelligibility, is merely a symptom of a frame of mind from within\nwhich meaning seems impossible, and that our proper task is to leave\nthis confused frame of mind behind (e.g., McDowell 1992 [1998: 272,\n274]; 1998a: 57\u201358). However, this line of reasoning might be\ntaken to presume that a question is urgent or intelligible only if it\nis in principle possible to offer a reductive answer to it, that\nconstructive philosophy is necessarily reductive philosophy. Verheggen\nargues that the rejection of reductionism does not commit one to\nquietism. As she sees it, non-reductionism can be constructive; it can\nrevolve around advancing and defending positive claims (Verheggen\n2000, 2003). Even though the project of providing necessary and\nsufficient conditions for meaning is hopeless, the non-reductionist\ncan still aspire to articulate necessary conditions that aren\u2019t\n\u201ceven remotely trivial\u201d (Myers and Verheggen 2016: 3), and\nto draw illuminating connections between meaning and other irreducible\nphenomena. Through a creative reconstruction of Davidson\u2019s\ntriangulation argument, Verheggen argues that interaction with a\nsecond individual and aspects of the shared world is a necessary\ncondition for one\u2019s having a language and thoughts (see chapter\n1 of Myers and Verheggen 2016). The constitution of the standards of\ncorrectness that govern language and thought necessitates that the\nindividual be aware of the possibility of being mistaken, an awareness\nthat can only be grounded in linguistic interactions with another\nindividual and features of the world. Thus, the triangulation argument\nis taken by Verheggen to reveal the hopelessness of the reductive\nambition, insofar as it shows that we cannot offer an account of the\nconstitution of the standards of correctness that govern language and\nthought without presupposing that a commitment to those standards is\nalready in place. (See also Sultanescu and Verheggen 2019 for an\naccount of the Davidsonian answer to Kripke\u2019s sceptical\nchallenge and Verheggen 2017a for an account of the Davidsonian answer\nto Wittgenstein\u2019s paradox.) William Child also defends a variety\nof non-reductionism, one that \u201cdoes not give merely pleonastic\nanswers but aims to say something genuinely informative\u201d (Child\n2019a: 97). He does so by relying on Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks on\nmeaning and rule-following.\n\nAccording to Wright, \u201cit is an important methodological precept\nthat we do not despair of giving answers to constitutive questions too\nsoon\u201d (2001: 191). He goes on to propose a non-reductionist view\nthat is sensitive to the difficulty of accounting for our knowledge of\nwhat we mean. (As we noted in\n section 2,\n Wright takes Kripke\u2019s sceptic to impose a legitimate\nepistemological constraint on answers to the skeptical challenge.) He\noffers a \u201cjudgment-dependent\u201d account of intention,\naccording to which what one intends is determined by one\u2019s best\njudgment about what one intends. Insofar as the concepts of intention\nand meaning are \u201crelevantly similar\u201d (2001: 206), this\naccount can also claim to shed light on the nature of meaning. Thus,\nwe might say, on Wright\u2019s behalf, that what one means by an\nexpression is determined by one\u2019s best judgment about what one\nmeans. The notion of judgment is taken by Wright as primitive. Still,\nthe authoritative nature of first-personal avowals is allegedly\nvindicated. See especially essays 5\u20137 in Wright\n 2001.[16]\n\nWright and Boghossian recently offered independent arguments to the\neffect that the adoption of a non-reductionist view of meaning does\nnot secure the intelligibility of the idea of guidance by a rule.\nAccording to Wright, the only way in which rule-following can be\nunderstood is if it conforms to what he calls \u201cthe modus ponens\nmodel\u201d (2007: 491). The model states that an act is a genuine\ninstance of rule-following if it can be rationalized by, on the one\nhand, citing the rule and, on the other, indicating that the\ncircumstances, which must be specifiable without appealing to the\nrule, call for its application. Wright investigates basic cases of\nlanguage use, and argues that if we assume that the modus ponens model\napplies to these cases, we are saddled with an Augustinian picture,\naccording to which conceptual capacities are necessarily prior to\ncapacities to use language. At the same time, he accepts that\nWittgenstein has revealed the bankruptcy of the Augustinian picture in\nPhilosophical Investigations; so, the idea of antecedent\nconceptual capacities is unintelligible. This is taken to show that\nthe modus ponens model cannot apply to basic cases. Wright calls this\n\u201cthe minor premise problem\u201d, and argues that it compels us\nto accept that \u201cin the basic case we do not really\nfollow\u2014are not really guided by\u2014anything\u201d\n(2007: 497).\n\nBoghossian also relies on the modus ponens model to argue that a\nnon-reductionist position does not allow us to make sense of the\nintelligibility of rule-following. He offers \u201can intuitive\ncharacterization\u201d of the phenomenon of rule-following, according\nto which it has the following structure: \n\n\na state that can play the role of rule-acceptance; and some\nnon-deviant causal chain leading from that state to a piece of\nbehavior that would allow us to say that the rule explains and (in the\npersonal-level case) rationalizes the behavior in question. (2012: 31)\n\n\n\nWhat allows us to say that the rule explains and rationalizes the\nbehaviour is an act of inference from the rule to what it requires in\nparticular contexts. But inference is, according to Boghossian,\n\u201can example of rule-following par excellence\u201d\n(2012: 40), which indicates that the act of inference must fit the\nintuitive characterization above, thus requiring a further act. A\nregress is unavoidable for the proponent of non-reductionism,\naccording to Boghossian. This is the inference problem.\n\nArguably, the two problems are anticipated in Kripke\u2019s line of\nreasoning, especially in his remark, mentioned earlier in this\nsection, to the effect that the non-reductionist view faces a logical\ndifficulty (1982: 51\u201352). The difficulty seems to arise from\nthree claims that seem uncontroversial but are inconsistent: \n\n the state of meaning plus by \u2018+\u2019 must guide the\nspeaker in her applications of the expression \u2018+\u2019; \n a state of meaning can be interpreted in more than one way; \n something that can be interpreted in more than one way cannot\nguide. \n\n\nWe might think that one\u2019s state of meaning something by an\nexpression is not the sort of thing that one can interpret (thus\ndenying (ii)), or that whether something can be interpreted in more\nthan one way is irrelevant for the question of whether it can guide\n(thus denying (iii)). But neither of these options entitles us to\nreject (i); the non-reductionist still owes us an account of what it\nis to be guided by a rule (or by one\u2019s understanding of an\nexpression).\n\nMiller offers an account of guidance by drawing on McDowell\u2019s\nwritings on Wittgenstein. He argues that the inference problem and the\nminor premise problem are not genuine difficulties for the\nnon-reductionist. On his view, the upshot of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nreflections on rule-following is that \n\n\nin applying a rule R in a particular case there need be no\nfurther inferential step\u2014over and above that involving\nR itself\u2014mediating between acceptance of R and that\nparticular application. (2015b: 405) \n\n\nThis is just what it is for rule-following not to be a matter\nof interpretation: the rule is applied immediately, as it\nwere\u2014without the mediation of a further rule, such as an\ninference rule, in the manner suggested by Boghossian, or a rule for\nthe deployment of a prior concept, in the manner suggested by Wright.\nWhat puts an agent in a position to follow a rule is her having been\ntrained into a practice or custom of following rules of that sort\n(2015b: 407), where the notions of training, practice, and custom are\nsemantically characterized and cannot receive further philosophical\nillumination.\n\nThus, according to some defenders of non-reductionism, rule-following\nhas an essentially social character. One dispute that is intramural to\nthe non-reductionist approach concerns the precise way in which this\nsocial character should be understood. When it comes to meaning,\nVerheggen distinguishes between communitarian views, according to\nwhich \n\n\nhaving a (first) language essentially depends on meaning by\none\u2019s words what members of some community mean by them, \n\n\nand interpersonalist views, according to which \n\n\nhaving a (first) language essentially depends on having used (at least\nsome of) one\u2019s words to communicate with others, (Myers and\nVerheggen 2016: 84; see also Verheggen 2006 for the initial\narticulation of the distinction) \n\n\nand goes on to defend the interpersonalist view. Relatedly, there is\nthe question of how we should understand the notions of practice and\ncustom and the role that they play in a correct conception of\nintentionality, broadly construed. It might be thought, as\nWittgenstein seems to suggest in Philosophical Investigations\n(e.g., #198; #201\u2013202), that it is essential to thinking and\nspeaking that one be trained into practices or customs, and thus that\nour conception should reflect the centrality of these notions\n(McDowell 1984, M. Williams 1999, Stroud 2000, M. Williams 2010,\nMiller 2015b); at least initially, this appears to favour the\ncommunitarian view. (See also Section 4 of Haase 2018 for a different\nkind of attempt to flesh out the Wittgensteinian notion of practice,\nand Pettit 1990 for a form of non-reductionism on which communal\ninteraction is required in at least some cases of rule-following). But\non the Davidsonian conception, at the centre of which is disagreement\nand the need to settle it rationally against the constraints of the\nshared world, the idea of practice might not serve any explanatory\npurpose; even though shared beliefs may be essential for thought,\nshared standards of correctness are not essential for language. The\nDavidsonian conception is a variety of interpersonalism. This\nintramural debate is very much ongoing.\n\nSome philosophers have explored the possibility of a middle path\nbetween reductive dispositionalism and non-reductionism. Thus, in a\npaper in which she discusses Stroud\u2019s view, Ginsborg\ndistinguishes between austere forms of non-reductionism, which she\ntakes to be incompatible with constructive philosophising about\nmeaning, and \u201cless austere and partly reductionist\u201d\napproaches, which allow that \u201cwe could account for meaning in\nterms of a more basic idea of goal-directed human activity\u201d\n(2011a: 153), but without allowing that such activity can be captured\nin purely dispositionalist or physicalist terms. She goes on to\narticulate a less austere view, which explains meaning in terms of a\nnotion of normativity that she takes to be primitive. On this view,\nfor someone to mean something by an expression is for her to have a\ndisposition to apply it in particular contexts and, crucially, to take\nthe manifestations of that disposition to be appropriate. Taking\none\u2019s responses to be appropriate \n\n\ndoes not depend on the antecedent grasp of a rule or standard\ndetermining that response as correct rather than incorrect, or even on\nthe awareness that there is such a rule or standard; (2011a: 169) \n\n\nthis establishes the primitive status of the notion of\nappropriateness. Thus, Ginsborg provides a dispositionalist account of\nmeaning, albeit with a crucial proviso to the effect that the relevant\ndispositions are to be characterized in normative terms. She thinks\nthat the account can serve as a straight solution to the sceptical\nchallenge. On the one hand, it purports to vindicate the normativity\nof meaning, and thus to meet the normativity condition; on the other\nhand, it purports to account for the distinction between correct and\nincorrect applications of expressions, and thus to meet the\nextensionality condition. For Ginsborg, the set of correct\napplications of an expression are the applications that one is\ndisposed to regard as appropriate\u2014the applications that ought,\nin the primitive sense, to be made (see Ginsborg 2011b for a more\ndetailed account of her solution to Kripke\u2019s problem).\n\nGinsborg\u2019s view is in some respects similar to Robert\nBrandom\u2019s. Brandom seeks to explain meaning in terms of use,\nwhere use is specified in a way that is \n\n\nneither so generous as to permit semantic or intentional vocabulary,\nnor so parsimonious as to insist on purely naturalistic vocabulary.\n(1994: xiii) \n\n\nThus, his approach to meaning might also be viewed as less austere and\npartly reductionist. We do not have room to explain the details of\nBrandom\u2019s intricate view; suffice it to say that, on that view,\nthe proper specification of the use that determines meaning\nessentially involves normative vocabulary. The facts that determine\nmeaning are facts about the entitlements and\ncommitments that are implicit in the performances of speech\nacts. Thus, what a speaker means by an utterance is to be understood\nas consisting, roughly, in the performances that she is committed to\nin virtue of the utterance as well as in the performances that entitle\nher to make it. Ultimately, these facts are \u201cproducts of human\nactivity\u201d (xiv), being a matter of our adopting normative\nattitudes toward one another--of taking one another to be\ncommitted or entitled, in light of our performances, to various other\nperformances. However, although there are similarities, there are also\nimportant differences between Brandom\u2019s approach and\nGinsborg\u2019s. While for Brandom the norms that are constitutive of\nmeaning are socially instituted, for Ginsborg they are natural.\nMoreover, the notion of appropriateness that Ginsborg fleshes out is\nmore basic than the notion of reason, and thus more basic than the\nnotions of entitlement and commitment that Brandom takes to be\nconstitutive of meaning (Ginsborg 2011a: 172fn21). Still, Ginsborg\ndoes think that \u201cexpressions have meanings only in virtue of\nthere being ways in which they ought to be applied\u201d (2012: 132).\nSo, to put it crudely, on both accounts, meaning facts are reduced to\nfacts or considerations about what ought to be the case. The question\nthat the austere non-reductionist will raise is whether the latter\nkinds of fact are apt to solve the indeterminacy problem, and thus to\nmeet the extensionality condition.\n\nThe challenge of the sceptic makes perspicuous the fact that a\nnon-semantically described pattern is compatible with indefinitely\nmany interpretations. Does the appeal to the normative domain help us\nrule out the sceptic\u2019s alternative hypotheses? Given that,\narguably, on a partly reductionist picture of the sort that Brandom\nproposes, utterances are, ultimately, nothing more than\n\u201cnormatively constrained noise- or mark-makings\u201d (Whiting\n2006: 11), that is, non-semantically described performances that stand\nin normative relations to other non-semantically described\nperformances, it does not seem that we have the resources to single\nout as privileged a particular interpretation or standard of\ncorrectness. Similarly, a normative pattern that instantiates how one\nought, in the primitive sense proposed by Ginsborg, to go on with\nrespect to an expression seems to be consistent with more than one\nsemantic interpretation of that expression. It might be thought that\nGinsborg could appeal to the non-semantically characterized\ndisposition in order to fix the meanings of the relevant expression.\nHowever, we have already shown in\n section 4\n that dispositionalist accounts face very serious obstacles (see\nVerheggen 2015; Chapter II of Myers and Verheggen 2016, and Miller\n2019 for more discussion of the failure of dispositionalism in\nrelation to Ginsborg\u2019s view). So, the proponent of the less\naustere approach to meaning owes the austere non-reductionist an\naccount of how the extensionality condition might be met. (See Haddock\n2012 and Sultanescu 2021 for more discussion of Ginsborg\u2019s view,\nand Rosen 1997, McDowell 2002, Hattiangadi 2003, and Whiting 2006 for\nmore discussion of Brandom\u2019s view.)\n",
