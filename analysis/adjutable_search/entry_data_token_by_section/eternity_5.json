    "main_text": "Brief Historical Remarks || Medieval Thinkers\n3.3 Medieval Thinkers\n\nAnselm (c. 1033\u20131109) presents a view similar to that of\nBoethius and Augustine.\n\n\nSuppose, on the other hand, that it exists as a whole in individual\ntimes severally and distinctly. (A human being, for instance, exists\nas a whole yesterday, today and tomorrow.) In this case we should,\nproperly, say that it was, is and will be. In which case its time-span\nis not simultaneously a whole. Rather it is stretched out in parts\nthrough the parts of time. But its time-span is its eternity and its\neternity is precisely itself. The supreme essence, therefore, would be\ncut up into parts along the divisions of time. (Anselm,\nMonologion, Ch. 21)\n\n\nFor Anselm, the timeless eternity of God follows from God\u2019s\nbeing that than which nothing greater can be conceived (cf.\n section 6.1).\n In the Proslogion, Anselm articulates a\n\u201cgrammar\u201d of the divine powers, which determines what it\nmakes sense to say of the most perfect being, including that\nbeing\u2019s timelessness.\n\nIn the medieval period, the discussion embraces not only Christian but\nalso Jewish and Islamic thinkers. In keeping with the sharp line drawn\nbetween the Creator and creation, Aquinas and the Jewish thinker Moses\nMaimonides (1131\u20131204) (who greatly influenced Aquinas) argue\nthat God\u2019s timeless eternity ought to be understood primarily in\nnegative terms. For Aquinas, God\u2019s timeless eternity is\nunending, lacking both beginning and end, and an instantaneous whole\nlacking succession. It is a correlate of divine simplicity (see the\nSEP entry on\n divine simplicity),\n and it is incapable of being defined or fully grasped by a creature.\nFor Aquinas too, timeless eternity constitutes part of the\n\u201cgrammar\u201d of talking about God. Since God is timelessly\neternal it does not make any sense to ask how many years God has\nexisted, or whether he is growing old, or what will he be doing later\non in the year.\n\nDespite differences with Thomas Aquinas regarding the nature of\nGod\u2019s relation to time, Duns Scotus (c.1266\u20131308) seems to\nhave upheld divine timelessness (though see Leftow 1991: 228). In\ngeneral, it would seem that commitment to divine simplicity,\nwidespread if not universal in the medieval period, entails a\ncommitment to divine timelessness (Mullins 2016: Ch. 3).\n",
