    "main_text": "Philosophical questions for IP || Regress\n3.5 Regress\nImprecise probabilities is a theory born of our limitations as\nreasoning agents, and of limitations in our evidence base. If only we\nhad better evidence, a single probability function would do. But since\nour evidence is weak, we must use a set. In a way, the same is true of\nprecise probabilism. If only we knew the truth, we could represent\nbelief with a truth-valuation function, or just a set of sentences\nthat are fully believed. But since there are truths we don\u2019t know, we\nmust use a probability to represent our intermediate confidence. And\nindeed, the same problem arises for the imprecise probabilist. Is it\nreasonable to assume that we know what set of probabilities best\nrepresents the evidence? Perhaps we should have a set of sets of\nprobabilities\u2026 Similar problems arise for theories of\nvagueness (Sorensen 2012). We objected\nto precise values for degrees of belief, so why be content with\nsets-valued beliefs with precise boundaries? This is the problem of\n\u201chigher-order vagueness\u201d recast as a problem for imprecise\nprobabilism. Why is sets of probabilities the right level to stop the\nregress at? Why not sets of sets? Why not second-order probabilities?\nWhy not single probability\nfunctions? Williamson (2014)\nmakes this point, and argues that a single precise probability is the\ncorrect level at which to get off the \u201cuncertainty\nescalator\u201d. Williamson advocates the betting interpretation of\nbelief, and his argument here presupposes that interpretation. But the\npoint is still worth addressing: for a particular interpretation of\nwhat belief is, what sort of level of uncertainty is appropriate. For\nthe functionalist interpretation suggested above, this is\nsomething of a pragmatic choice. The further we allow this regress to\ncontinue, the harder it is to deal with these belief-representing\nobjects. So let\u2019s not go further than we need.\nWe have seen arguments above that IP does have some advantage over\nprecise probabilism, in the capacity to represent suspending\njudgement, the difference between weight and balance of evidence and\nso on. So we must go at least this far up the uncertainty\nescalator. But for the sake of practicality we need not go any\nfurther, even though there are hierarchical Bayes models that would\ngive us a well-defined theory of higher-order models of belief. This\nis, ultimately, a pragmatic argument. Actual human belief states are\nprobably immensely complicated neurological patterns with all the\nattendant complexity, interactivity, reflexivity and vagueness. We\nare modelling belief, so it is about choosing a model at the\nright level of complexity. If you are working out the trajectory of a\ncannonball on earth, you can safely ignore the gravitational influence\nof the moon on the cannonball. Likewise, there will be contexts where\nsimple models of belief are appropriate: perhaps your belief state is\njust a set of sentences of a language, or perhaps just a single\nprobability function. If, however, you are modelling the tides, then\nthe gravitational influence of the moon needs to be involved: the\nmodel needs to be more complex. This suggests that an adequate model of\nbelief under severe uncertainty may need to move beyond the single\nprobability paradigm. But a pragmatic argument says that we should\nonly move as far as we need to. So while you need to model the moon to\nget the tides right, you can get away without having Venus in your\nmodel. This relates to the contextual nature of appropriateness for\nmodels of belief mentioned earlier. If one were attempting to\nprovide a complete formal characterisation of the ontology of\nbelief, then these regress worries would be significantly harder to\navoid.\nLet\u2019s imagine that we had a second order\nprobability \\(\\mu\\) defined over the set of\n(first order) probabilities \\(P\\). We could\nthen reduce uncertainty to a single function\nby \\(p^*(X) = \\sum_P \\mu(p)p(X)\\)\n(if \\(P\\) is finite, in the interests of\nkeeping things simple I discuss only this case). Now\nif \\(p^*(X)\\) is what is used in decision\nmaking, then there is no real sense in which we have a genuine IP\nmodel, and it cannot rationalise the Ellsberg choice, nor can it give\nrise to incomparability. If there is some alternative use\nthat \\(\\mu\\) is put to, a use that allows\nincomparability and that rationalises Ellsberg choices, then it might\nbe a genuine rival to credal sets, but it represents just as much of a\ndeparture from the orthodox theory as IP does.\nG\u00e4rdenfors and Sahlin\u2019s Unreliable Probabilities model\nenriches a basic IP approach with a \u201creliability index\u201d\n(see the\n historical appendix).\n Lyon (2017)\nenriches the standard IP picture in a different way: he adds a\nprivileged \u201cbest guess\u201d probability. This modification\nallows for better aggregation of elicited IP estimates. How best to\ninterpret such a model is still an open question. Other enriched IP\nmodels are no doubt available.\n",
