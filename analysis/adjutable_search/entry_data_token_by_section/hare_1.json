    "main_text": "The Language of Morals\n2. The Language of Morals\n\n\nPhilosophically, Hare came under two influences that together led him\nto views that he could always retain. One was emotivism. He followed\nthis in accepting a broadly empiricist view of facts that excluded\nmoral facts in any unetiolated sense of \u201cfact\u201d.  However,\nhe never adopted the verification principle of meaning in any\nthorough-going way. He also recoiled from any causal account of\n\u201cemotive meaning\u201d that reduced moral discourse to\nemotional manipulation. It became a recurrent theme that emotivism\nwent wrong by connecting the meaning of moral language with its\nperlocutionary, rather than its illocutionary, force (1997a:\n112\u201314), that is, with what we do by\nor through using it, rather than what we do in using\nit.\n\n\nThe other influence was Kantian. From H.J. Paton\u2019s lectures on Kant,\nand articles by Reginald Jackson, he learnt that imperatives fall\nwithin the realm of reason. This led him into a study of imperative\nlogic, a topic already being explored in Scandinavia (especially by\nAlf Ross), but unfamiliar in Britain. In his first published article,\n\u201cImperative Sentences\u201d (1949), in his essay\n\u201cPractical Reason\u201d entered for the T.H. Green Moral\nPhilosophy prize in 1950, and in his first book, The Language of\nMorals (1952), he explored the possibilities of inferring\nimperative conclusions from imperative, or a combination of imperative\nand indicative, premises.\n\nThe Language of Morals introduced a distinction between\nprescriptive and descriptive meaning. Prescriptive meaning is defined\nin relation to imperatives: a statement is prescriptive if it entails,\nif necessary in conjunction with purely factual statements, at least\none imperative; and to assent to an imperative is to prescribe action.\nDescriptive meaning is defined in relation to truth-conditions: a\nstatement is descriptive to the extent that factual conditions for its\ncorrect application define its meaning. It is taken for granted, in\nthe tradition of Hume, that the factual is only contingently\nmotivating: desire is no part of sincere assent to a purely factual\nstatement. A moral statement has prescriptive meaning, but may also be\npartly descriptive. Thus \u201cA [a person] ought\nto \u03c6\u201d entails the imperative\n\u201cLet A \u03c6\u201d, so that to assent to it sincerely\nis to have an overriding desire (which in application to oneself will\namount, if its satisfaction appears practicable, to an intention)\nthat A \u03c6. If there are agreed reasons for \u03c6-ing\nwithin a linguistic community, say that it is enjoyable,\n\u201cA ought to \u03c6\u201d may take on the descriptive\nimplication of \u201c\u03c6-ing is\nenjoyable\u201d. \u201cX is a good F\u201d\nprescribes choice within a certain range (e.g., for someone who is\nchoosing an F); it takes on a descriptive connotation if\nthere are agreed standards for assessing Fs.\n\n\nHare never said that ethical statements are imperatives;\nhowever, it is striking that non-descriptive or evaluative meaning is\ndefined in terms of imperatives. This at once gave a clear sense to\nhis endorsement of Hume\u2019s denial that one can derive an\n\u201cought\u201d from an \u201cis\u201d. It also coincided, at\nleast in appearance, with Kant, and was to become essential for later\ndevelopments that brought results comparable to Kant\u2019s. However, a\nHumean who lacked Kant\u2019s belief in a purely rational will might prefer\nto make ethical statements more loosely expressive of wish or desire,\nor even aspiration; and this could avoid what is everyone\u2019s first\nobjection to prescriptivism, that, intuitively, \u201cI ought\nto \u03c6\u201d does not entail \u201cI will \u03c6\u201d\n(expressing intention). Hare took courage from the fact that Socrates\nand Aristotle incur much the same objection; as he liked to urge,\nSocrates wasn\u2019t simply making a mistake. His initial reply was that\ncases of failing to try to do what one admits one ought to do may\ninvolve psychological incapacity, or an off-color use of\n\u201cought\u201d that sheds its full prescriptive meaning. He was\nto return more fully to the issue in a chapter of his second\nbook, Freedom and Reason (1963), and again in a late\nencyclopedia article, \u201cWeakness of the Will\u201d (1992). In\nthis last piece he acknowledges that different things go wrong in\ndifferent cases. At times, the true story may even involve something\nlike Plato\u2019s partition of the soul (which was designed to accommodate\nconscious self-contradiction).\n",
