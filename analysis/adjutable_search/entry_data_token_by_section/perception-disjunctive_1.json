    "main_text": "Varieties of Disjunctivism\n2. Varieties of Disjunctivism\n\n\nThere are some significant differences between some of the views that\nfall under the disjunctivist label. Disjunctivists are united in their\nrejection of a common kind claim, and they generally adopt this stance\nbecause they hold views about the nature of veridical perception that\nthey take to be inconsistent with it. However, not all disjunctivists\nare in agreement over the account that should be given of veridical\nperception, and not all disjunctivists are in agreement over the\nquestion of the accounts that should be given of hallucinations and\nillusions. The different disjunctivist proposals about illusion and\nhallucination are discussed in section 5. This section focuses on some\nof the main differences between the accounts that disjunctivists offer\nof the relevant features that they claim veridical perceptions have,\nand which they claim hallucinations lack.\n\n\nThe fact that there are some significant differences between some of\nthe views that fall under the disjunctivist label can introduce\ncomplications when it comes to trying to formulate more precisely a\ndistinctively disjunctivist commitment that is common to all\nof them. So first (in section 2.1) some further remarks are in order\nconcerning some of the different ways in which disjunctivism in\ngeneral has been formulated in the literature. When it comes to\nassessing arguments that are presented as being either for or against\ndisjunctivism it is obviously going to be important to be sensitive to\nthe question of which formulation of disjunctivism is in play. Given\nthat many who adopt a disjunctivist position do so in defence of a\nparticular account of veridical perception, it will also be important\nto assess which disjunctivist commitment, if any, is actually entailed\nby their view of the nature of veridical perception.\n",
