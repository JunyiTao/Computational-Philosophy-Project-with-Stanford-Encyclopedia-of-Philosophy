    "main_text": "The Debate over the Conventionality of Language || Conventionalist Responses\n2.4 Conventionalist Responses\n\nDavidson\u2019s position, conceived as an objection to Lewis, comes\nwith three separate claims. First, as demonstrated in the case of\nmalapropisms, antecedent knowledge of L prior to a given use\nmay not be enough to reach successful communication, because\n\u201cprior meanings\u201d may not coincide between speaker and\nhearer and, thus, antecedent knowledge is not mutual. Second, once the\nrelevant use takes place, mutual knowledge of L is reached,\nwhich is enough to achieve communication, but such knowledge is not\ngrasped antecedently. Third, the move from insufficient antecedent\nknowledge of L to successful communication may happen in virtue\nof non-linguistic knowledge (i.e., practical reasoning, explanatory\nreasoning, general knowledge, etc.), but this knowledge is not\nsystematic.\n\nLewis, it seems, has a way to reply to Davidson\u2019s objection.\nWe will only sketch such a reply here. Recall the central tenets of Lewis\u2019s\naccount. First, languages (all of them, including natural ones) are\nabstract objects, a function from sentences to meanings. These\nfunctions may be as complex as required; they may take as arguments more\nthan just sentences (i.e., occasions of use, times, worlds, speakers,\netc.). As with any abstract object, these functions are what they are\nindependently of any convention that may hold among human populations.\nSecond, humans face a coordination problem. To solve it, they use some\nlanguage or other, some abstract set of functions or other. Third, for\nthe use of an abstract object L to successfully solve the\ncoordination problem among members of a population P, at least\ntwo conventions must hold among members of P: the conventions\nof truthfulness and of trust in L. Finally, it is assumed that\nmembers of P know all relevant functions, or have a way to know\nthem, for any possible sentence of L. In short, members of\nP antecedently know (in some sense) all the relevant\nsentence-to-meaning functions of L.\n\nNow, Davidson presents us with a case where antecedent knowledge of\nL is not enough to guarantee communication and, hence, to solve\nthe coordination problem that Lewis has in mind. Yet, there clearly is\na way in which speakers manage to solve the coordination problem even\nin cases of malapropisms. Davidson suggests that this is done in\nvirtue of using non-linguistic knowledge (e.g., using practical\nreasoning, explanatory reasoning, etc.). To see if such uses of\nL really constitute a counterexample to Lewis\u2019s position\nwe must ask ourselves if, in solving this coordination problem,\nspeaker and hearer do observe the conventions of truthfulness and\ntrust in L, or if they simply reject them in order to\nsuccessfully communicate.\n\nA quick glance at Davidson\u2019s example suggests that, even in\ncases of malapropisms, speaker and hearer do observe the said\nconventions. Both speaker S and hearer H presuppose that\nthey are using the same language, even though they do not realize that\nthis is not exactly true (i.e., in virtue of having different\nprior theories they do not share the same prior-L);\nyet, despite her malapropism, S is still being truthful.\nH assumes S to be truthful, and so finds a way to\nreinterpret S by engaging in practical, explanatory, or another\nform of general reasoning. Thus, we must take H as observing\nthe convention of trust, for otherwise H\u2019s diagnosis of\nS\u2019s malapropism (together with H\u2019s\nreinterpretation of S\u2019s original utterances) would be\nabsurd. Furthermore, it seems that something like an assumption of\ncompositionality is also in place, for otherwise it would be strange\nfor H to (so to speak) interpolate the expression \u201ca nice\nderangement of epitaphs\u201d, which seems to compose its meaning in\njust the same way as \u201ca nice arrangement of epithets\u201d.\n\nFrom here a Lewisian reply could follow either one of two strategies.\nOne would be to allow that the account does not extend to malapropisms\nbut treat malapropisms as a special case, an example of a non-purely\nlinguistic phenomenon that, as such, necessarily involves general\nintelligence. The success of this strategy depends on how\ngeneralizable these cases are.\n\nA second strategy would be to revise the theory in order to include\ngeneral intelligence as a central element. This should not have to be\nproblematic since Lewis\u2019s theory is meant as an idealization. As\nLewis notes, general intelligence is already needed to deal with\nvagueness, indexicality, and other phenomena. Nor would Lewis be alone\nin claiming this. Some have claimed that \u201cpragmatic determinants\nof what is said\u201d are at work in every single utterance. (For\nmore on this same theme, see the entries on\n pragmatics\n and\n defaults in semantics and pragmatics.)\n\nThis second strategy might itself be developed in two distinct ways,\nin an effort to show its compatibility with the broad sweep of\nLewis\u2019s theory. First, it could be admitted that there is no\nprior L with respect to which the conventions of truthfulness\nand trust both hold. The conventions hold, however, with respect to\ntheir passing theories. Participants arrive at these passing\ntheories from their (potentially divergent) prior theories plus some\ngeneral intelligence. Compositionality, moreover, also plays an\nessential role in the extraction of passing theories from prior\ntheories, with the conventions of truthfulness and trust being\nobserved in the resulting passing L. However, the principle of\ncompositionality would have to be weakened so as to not consider the\nstrictly linguistic process it describes as fully determining meaning,\nthus leaving room for extra elements to take part. Alternatively,\nthere could be truthfulness and trust in prior L if\nLewis\u2019s fine-grained individuation of languages is rejected. On\nthis second version of the theory, one and the same L may\nsometimes have different sentence-to-meaning mappings; alternatively,\nit could be claimed that the conventions hold with respect to\ndifferent common Ls or a set of sufficiently similar such\nlanguages.\n\nWith appropriate extrapolation, then, Lewis\u2019s main tenets may be\nperfectly compatible with Davidson\u2019s own description of these\nsupposedly troublesome cases. Even in cases of malapropism, speaker\nand hearer are trying to solve a coordination problem by using a\ncommon language L (i.e., a common passing L, a common\nopen or dynamic L, or a common set of sufficiently similar\nLs) in a way that observes the conventions of truthfulness and\ntrust. Of course, Lewis must include some form of general explanatory\nreasoning, thereby contradicting his apparent assumption that\nsuccessful uses of L are fully systematic (or compositional).\nYet it is worth considering how damaging this would be for\nLewis\u2019s account. It seems clear that something like\nLewis\u2019s theory (including some appropriately weakened version of\nhis compositionality assumption, such as that developed in\nGarc\u00eda-Ram\u00edrez 2019), will be needed.\n",
