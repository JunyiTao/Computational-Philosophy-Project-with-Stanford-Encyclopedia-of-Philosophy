    "main_text": "Priority of method\n7. Conclusion\n\n\nIt is clear that any interpretation of Arcesilaus must take into\naccount both his reputation as a master dialectician who deployed\nSocrates\u2019 method ruthlessly against his philosophical\ncontemporaries, and his notorious advocacy of\ninapprehensibility and universal suspension. Given\nthe contradictory nature and scarcity of the evidence, it is perhaps\nnot surprising that modern critics do not agree about the success of\nthe \u2018dialectical\u2019 or various \u2018doctrinal\u2019\ninterpretations of Arcesilaus or about the consistency of the very\ndifferent kinds of skepticism the latter propose. But further progress\nis not ruled out, since it is open to us to offer more sophisticated\nphilosophical elaborations of those forms of skepticism and to test\ntheir historical plausibility by appealing to the diverse, but better\nattested traditions in the later Academy.\n",
