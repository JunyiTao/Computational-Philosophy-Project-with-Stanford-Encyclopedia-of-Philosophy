    "main_text": "Game and Term Formalism\n2. Game and Term Formalism\n\nFrege does not extract a unified, consistent position from the work of\nHeine and Thomae, and much of his criticism is devoted to showing that\nthey inconsistently slip into modes of thought which are only\nappropriate for \u2018contentful\u2019 arithmetic, which Frege takes\nto be a body of truths expressed by utterances in which numerical\nexpressions designate abstract referents independent of the mind (or\nat least any particular individual\u2019s mind). Heine and Thomae\ntalk of mathematical domains and structures, of prohibitions on what\nmay be uttered (e.g. against writing \u2018\\(3\\div 0\\)\u2019 which is\ndeemed, in some special sense, meaningless), of numbers being greater\nthan or less than one another (rather than physical marks being larger or\nsmaller, darker or lighter)\u2014all things which make no sense if\narithmetic is a theory of marks and their physical properties or is\njust a body of transformations of referent-less symbols. (Heine\nhowever reserves, with Kronecker, a special place for arithmetic,\ntreating it in non-formalist fashion; this position may thus be more\ncoherent than Thomae\u2019s. See Simons, 2009 especially\n293\u20136.)\n\nNonetheless two distinct positions emerge from the material Frege\nworks over, doctrines which Resnik (1980: 54), and likewise Shapiro\n(2000: 41\u201348) describe as term formalism and game\nformalism, respectively. The term formalist views the expressions\nof mathematics, arithmetic for example, as meaningful, the singular\nterms as referring, but as referring to symbols such as\nthemselves, rather than numbers, construed as entities distinct from\nsymbols. Thus Heine writes:\n\nI define from the standpoint of the pure formalist and call\ncertain tangible signs numbers. (quoted in Frege, 1903 [1980\n\u00a787: 183]).\n\n\nThe game formalist sticks with the view that mathematical utterances\nhave no meaning; or at any rate the terms occurring therein do not\npick out objects and properties and the utterances cannot be used to\nstate facts. Rather mathematics is a calculus in which\n\u2018empty\u2019 symbol strings are transformed according to fixed\nrules. Thomae puts it this way:\n\nFor the formalist, arithmetic is a game with signs which are called\nempty. That means that they have no other content (in the calculating\ngame) than they are assigned by their behaviour with respect to\ncertain rules of combination (rules of the game) (Frege, 1903/80\n\u00a795: 190).\n\n\nThomae also remarks \u2018the formal standpoint rids us of all\nmetaphysical difficulties\u2019 (ibid: 184). One main\nmotivation then seems to be to block, avoid, or sidestep (in some way)\nany ontological commitment to a problematic realm of abstract objects.\nFor standard mathematics entails a plethora of theorems affirming the\nexistence of infinite realms of entities\u2014numbers, functions,\nsets and so forth, entities which do not seem to be concrete.\nFormalists, in general, wish to divest themselves of any commitment to\nthese domains which do, indeed, seem hard to fit into a thoroughly\nnaturalistic conception of reality.\n\nFrege concentrates most of his fire on the term formalist\npronouncements of his targets; but game formalism is the only game in\ntown for the anti-platonist worried about the ontological commitment\nto a realm of abstract objects. For term formalism treats mathematics\nas having a content, as being a kind of syntactic theory; and standard\nsyntactic theory entails the existence of an infinity of\nentities\u2014expression types\u2014which seem every bit as abstract\nas numbers. Indeed, as G\u00f6del\u2019s arithmetisation of syntax\nshowed, the elements and inter-relationships of standard formal syntax\ncan be modelled as an infinite substructure inside the standard model of\narithmetic.\n\nFrege mercilessly exposes the inadequacies of Heine and Thomae\u2019s\nposition\u2010their confusions as they slip from term to game\nformalism; their conflation of sign and signified; the fact that they\ndo not set out an account of the syntax and proof theory which is\nremotely adequate as an account of the mathematics with which they\ndeal; their hopeless attempts to extend their position from arithmetic\nto treat of analysis and real numbers, by this stage in mathematical\nhistory construed by Weierstrass, Cantor and others not geometrically\nbut as infinite sequences. Thus Frege writes:\n\nIn order to produce it [an infinite series] we would need an\ninfinitely long blackboard, an infinite supply of chalk, and an\ninfinite length of time. We may be censured as too cruel for trying to\ncrush so high a flight of the spirit by such a homely objection; but\nthis is no answer. (219)\n\n\nNow Frege, himself, ironically, had revolutionised mathematics by\nintroducing hitherto unprecedented standards of rigour in the\nformalisation of mathematical theories. He recognised (\u00a790:\n185\u20136) that one could improve vastly on Heine and Thomae by\ntreating mathematical theories, their language, axioms and rules, as\nformal, mathematical objects in their own right. This is exactly what\nthe Hilbert programme set out successfully to achieve, creating the\nnew disciple of metamathematics.\n\nHowever Frege lays down very stiff challenges even for a rigorous game\nformalist fully equipped with the techniques and results of\nmetamathematics. Such a theorist gives us a characterisation of a\nlanguage, for example by setting out what the basic elements\nare\u2014primitive symbols, and strings thereof\u2014and then gives\na recursive specification of which strings count as well-formed.\nSimilarly we will be given a rigorous specification of which\narrangements of well-formed formulae count as proofs in a given\nsystem, and of what theorem they prove in each case. If strings such\nas \u2018\\(3+1=0\\)\u2019 or \u2018\\(3 \\gt 2\\)\u2019 come out as provable\nin the system (arithmetic modulo 4, say) then that is enough to count\nthem as correct utterances of the system. No further issue of truth\nneed arise; nor do we need to assume that there is only one system for\na given set of symbols. Nor, furthermore, need we assume that each\nsuch system is complete (though Frege took Thomae to task for the\nincompleteness, massive though readily rectifiable, of his arithmetic\ncalculus). We need make no assumption that the numerals in these\nstrings refer to anything outside the system, indeed we need not\nassume they refer to anything at all. (This game formalist, then, is\nnot subject to the objection that \u20183 \\(\\gt \n2\\)\u2019 should come out as false, on any legitimate formalist reading\nof \u2018\\(\\gt\\)\u2019; no need to think of the numerals as referring\nto concrete marks and \u2018\\(\\gt\\)\u2019 meaning physically greater in\nsize.)\n\nSuch a game formalist is a more worthy opponent for the platonistic\nFrege to tackle, but there are two main objections he sets out which\nstill apply to this more sophisticated position. The first is the\nquestion of applicability: if mathematics is just a calculus\nin which we shuffle uninterpreted symbols (or symbols whose\ninterpretation is a matter of no importance), then why has it been\napplied so successfully\u2014and in so many ways, to so many\ndifferent things\u2014ordinary physical objects, sub-atomic objects,\nfields, properties, and indeed from one part of mathematics to another\n(we can count the number of dimensions in a pure geometric space)?\nFrege writes:\n\nIt is applicability alone which elevates arithmetic from a game to the\nrank of a science. (\u00a791 in Frege 1903 [1980: 187])\n\n\nSecondly, Frege quite rightly and insistently distinguishes on the one\nhand the \u2018game\u2019\u2014arithmetic, set theory, topology or\nwhatever\u2014treated simply as a mathematical object in its own\nright, a formal system, and, on the another, the theory of the game.\n\u2018Let us remember that the theory of the game must be\ndistinguished from the game itself\u2019 (\u00a7107, p. 203). Thus in\nthe \u2018game\u2019 of trigonometry we might derive\n\n\\[\n\\sin^2\\theta +\\cos^2\\theta = 1\n\\]\n\n\nfrom the Pythagorean Theorem. In the metatheory we can prove:\n\n\\[\n\\vdash \\langle \\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta = 1\\rangle,\n\\]\n\n\nthe claim that the formula with such and such a code in the\nmathematical representation of the syntax (the code represented in the\nmeta-meta-theory here by \u2018\\(\\langle\\sin^2\\theta +\\cos^2\\theta =\n1\\rangle\\)\u2019) is provable. Likewise in the meta-theory we can\nprove lots of other things about proof and refutation, for instance we\nmay be able to show that lots of sentences are neither provable nor\nrefutable.\n\nThe problem this raises for the formalist is this: the metatheory is\nitself a substantial piece of mathematics, ostensibly committed to an\ninfinite realm of objects which are not, on the face of it, concrete.\nTokens of the expressions of the object language game calculus may be\nfinite\u2014ink marks and the like; but since there are infinitely\nmany expressions, theorems and proofs, these themselves must be taken\nto be abstract types. At best, the formalist can achieve no more than\na reduction in commitment from the transfinite realms of some\nmathematical theories, such as set theory, to the countably infinite,\nbut still presumably abstract, realm of arithmetic, wherein the syntax\nand proof theory of standard countable languages such as those of\nstandard set theory, can, as G\u00f6del showed, be modelled.\n\nCan formalism be developed in such a way as to surmount these two\ncrucial objections, the problem of applicability and the problem of\nthe metatheory, as I will call it? (Not that these are the only\nobjections to formalism, but they are two fundamental ones.) Because\nFrege\u2019s critique did not quash all formalistic impulses in later\nphilosophers of mathematics, we shall look, now, at future\ndevelopments, to see how they fare.\n",
