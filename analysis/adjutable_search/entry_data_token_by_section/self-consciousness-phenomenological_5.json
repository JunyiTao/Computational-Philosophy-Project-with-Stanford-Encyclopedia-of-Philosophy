    "main_text": "Intersubjective and social forms of self-consciousness\n6. Conclusion\n\nThe notion of self-consciousness has been the subject of a rich and\ncomplex analysis in the phenomenological tradition. Aspects of the\nphenomenological analysis also show up in other areas of research,\nincluding feminism (Stawarska 2006; Young 2005; Hein\u00e4maa 2003),\necological psychology (Gibson 1966), and recent analyses of enactive\nperception (Gallagher 2017b; No\u00eb 2004; Thompson 2008). The\nrecognition of the existence of a primitive form of prereflective\nself-consciousness is an important starting point for an understanding\nof more elaborate forms of self-consciousness that are concept- and\nlanguage-dependent. Phenomenological analyses show these processes to\nbe more than purely mental or cognitive events since they integrally\ninvolve embodiment and intersubjective dimensions.\n",
