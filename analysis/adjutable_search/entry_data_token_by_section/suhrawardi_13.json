    "main_text": "Suhrawardi\u2019s Legacy || Post-Suhrawardian Traditions\n6.2 Historiography\n\nTwo main schools of thought dominate the historiography of the\nIlluminationist tradition. The first, more prevalent and older school,\nviews Suhrawardi as the founder of a mystical, or\n\u2018theosophical\u2019 tradition. Henry Corbin, the father of\ncontemporary Suhrawardiana studies, introduced this paradigm\n(Gutas 2002, 16\u20139). \n\nHis interest in the Shaykh al-ishraq rested primarily with\nthe latter\u2019s hikmat al-ishraq, Corbin\u2019s\n\u2018Oriental theosophy\u2019 \u2014 the lost mythological\ntraditions of the Ancient sages of the West and the East \u2014\nSuhrawardi was reviving, also with his Persian allegories, (views\nshared by Nasr). Interested mainly in his mystical views and\nmetaphysics of light and irradiation, he saw little interest in\nediting Suhrawardi\u2019s works on logic and physics. These\n\u2018gnostic\u2019/\u2018mystic\u2019,\n\u2018esoteric\u2019/\u2018theosophical\u2019 wisdom, or even\npre-Aristotelian philosophia perennis or universalis\n(Nasr 1964, 60\u20133) approaches to Suhrawardi\u2019s works often\noveremphasize the mystical and the theosophical at the expense of the\nphilosophical, and thus blur the distinction between philosophy,\ntheology and mysticism (cf. Pourjavady 2013). Proponents of this\napproach highlight Suhrawardi\u2019s aim to expound on\nAvicenna\u2019s incomplete project to develop an\n\u2018Eastern\u2019 (mashriqiyya) (not\n\u2018illuminative\u2019) philosophy of Khurasan, in spite of the\nfact that Avicenna\u2019s \u2018Eastern\u2019 philosophy was not a\nmystical enterprise; rather, it aimed at developing a philosophical\ntradition distinct from the \u2018Western\u2019 philosophical school\nof Baghdad (Gutas 2000). Many scholars often overlook the fact that\nSuhrawardi\u2019s major works are largely devoted to technical\nphilosophical questions and theories of which even his allegorical or\nminor works are not devoid. More generally, the proponents of the\nmystical approach interpret Suhrawardi\u2019s ishraqiviews\nas a break or a departure from the philosophical tradition. Some, like\nFakhry (1982), go so far as to question the originality of the\nisharqi elements of his work, deeming it a mere transposition\nof Avicennan philosophy into a light terminology. \n\nThe second, more recent school, views the novel elements of\nSuhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi system as an original\nphilosophical \u2018critique\u2019 \u2014 in the wake of the\nreassessments of Abu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi, Fakhr al-Din al-Razi and\nal-Ghazali \u2014 a reconfiguration of Avicennan Peripateticism, an\ninterpretation adopted by a great many of his medieval commentators.\nSome contemporary commentators, like Izutsu (1971), explore the\nanalytical aspect of Suhrawardi\u2019s work; others, like Mehdi\nHa\u2019iri Yazdi (1992) and Jalal al-Din Ashtiyani, propose\n\u2018Neo-Avicennan\u2019 interpretations of the ishraqi\ntradition (Amin Razavi 2013, xvii\u2013xix). Ziai (1990) focuses\nprimarily on his logic; whereas Walbridge (1992) studied, first, the\nwork of Qutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311), and then the philosophical\nheritage of Ancient sages and wisdoms (Greeks, Stoic, Platonic, etc.;\npre-Socratics; Persians, etc.) of Suhrawardi\u2019s ishraqi\nsystem (2000, 2001, etc.). \n\nWhile some, like Corbin (1971), Nasr (1964) and Mohammad Mo\u2019in\n(1948, 1950), view Suhrawardi as the reviver of some ancient form of\nPersian philosophy; some, like Shahab Ahmed (d. 2015) have\noveremphasized his role within the Islamic\n East[3];\n still others are more skeptical. For example, Ziai (2003, 484) notes\nthe absence of an independent textual Persian philosophical tradition,\nalthough he believes that the Islamic ishraqi philosophical\ntradition incorporated \u201cMazdayasnian sentiments kept alive in\npopular and oral traditions and in poetic, epic and mystical\ncompositions\u201d. Gutas (2003) also notes the lack of any textual\nevidence to support claims that Suhrawardi attempted to revive ancient\nWestern Greek, Gnostic, and Hermetic traditions and suggests focusing\nresearch on the reasons why Suhrawardi appeals to the authority of the\n\u2018Ancients\u2019, East and West, rather than trying to find\n\u2018real\u2019 historical filiations to sources to which he\nmight have had access. \n\nSince the 1990s, interest in Suhrawardi\u2019s work and\nishraqi philosophical system and its reception was rekindled\n(Ziai 1990; Walbridge 1992, 2000, 2001; Amin Razavi 2004). However,\nalthough some recent scholarship has focused on his critique of\nAvicennan Peripatetic views, as well as explored a number of more\nspecific logical, physical, psychological, epistemological,\nontological, and metaphysical issues of Suhrawardi\u2019s major\nArabic works, further studies is still needed to add to our knowledge\nof the influence of Avicenna\u2019s major works (Cure,\nPointers and Reminders, even Discussions),\nas well as the influence of the Arabic Platonic and Neoplatonic\ntraditions in the form they would have been available to him. Eichner\n(2011, 140) suggests any \u201cinterpretation of Suhrawardian texts\nmust avoid simply assuming that they were rendered correctly by later\ninterpretations, which sought to present a unified and coherent\naccount of his system and the relation of that system to\nPeripateticism\u201d. This methodological principle would help\nrevisit Suhrawardi\u2019s work, and to produce much-needed studies on\nthe works of authors who belonged to, or were influenced by various\nand novel ishraqi elements (cf. Gheissari et al.\n2018), to chart the complex historical and philosophical developments\nof what was to become known as a novel \u2018Illuminationist\u2019\ntradition. This would undoubtedly provide new insights into his\ndistinctly Platonic reworking of Avicennan Peripateticism, what Gutas\n(2002) has identified as Suhrawardi\u2019s \u2018Illuminationist\nAvicennism\u2019.\n",
