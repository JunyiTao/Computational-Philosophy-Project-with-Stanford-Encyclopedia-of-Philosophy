    "main_text": "The State of Nature\n3. The State of Nature\n\nTo establish these conclusions, Hobbes invites us to consider what\nlife would be like in a state of nature, that is, a condition without\ngovernment. Perhaps we would imagine that people might fare best in\nsuch a state, where each decides for herself how to act, and is judge,\njury and executioner in her own case whenever disputes arise\u2014and\nthat at any rate, this state is the appropriate baseline against which\nto judge the justifiability of political arrangements. Hobbes terms\nthis situation \u201cthe condition of mere nature\u201d, a state of\nperfectly private judgment, in which there is no agency with\nrecognized authority to arbitrate disputes and effective power to\nenforce its decisions.\n\nHobbes\u2019s near descendant, John Locke, insisted in his Second\nTreatise of Government that the state of nature was indeed to be\npreferred to subjection to the arbitrary power of an absolute\nsovereign. But Hobbes famously argued that such a \u201cdissolute\ncondition of masterlesse men, without subjection to Lawes, and a\ncoercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge\u201d\nwould make impossible all of the basic security upon which\ncomfortable, sociable, civilized life depends. There would be\n\u201cno place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain;\nand consequently no culture of the earth; no navigation, nor use of\nthe commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building;\nno Instruments of moving and removing such things as require much\nforce; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no\nArts; no Letters; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and\ndanger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty,\nbrutish, and short.\u201d If this is the state of nature, people have\nstrong reasons to avoid it, which can be done only by submitting to\nsome mutually recognized public authority, for \u201cso long a man is\nin the condition of mere nature, (which is a condition of war,) as\nprivate appetite is the measure of good and evill.\u201d\n\nAlthough many readers have criticized Hobbes\u2019s state of nature\nas unduly pessimistic, he constructs it from a number of individually\nplausible empirical and normative assumptions. He assumes that people\nare sufficiently similar in their mental and physical attributes that\nno one is invulnerable nor can expect to be able to dominate the\nothers. Hobbes assumes that people generally \u201cshun death\u201d,\nand that the desire to preserve their own lives is very strong in most\npeople. While people have local affections, their benevolence is\nlimited, and they have a tendency to partiality. Concerned that others\nshould agree with their own high opinions of themselves, people are\nsensitive to slights. They make evaluative judgments, but often use\nseemingly impersonal terms like \u2018good\u2019 and\n\u2018bad\u2019 to stand for their own personal preferences. They\nare curious about the causes of events, and anxious about their\nfutures; according to Hobbes, these characteristics incline people to\nadopt religious beliefs, although the content of those beliefs will\ndiffer depending upon the sort of religious education one has happened\nto receive.\n\nWith respect to normative assumptions, Hobbes ascribes to each person\nin the state of nature a liberty right to preserve herself, which he\nterms \u201cthe right of nature\u201d. This is the right to do\nwhatever one sincerely judges needful for one\u2019s preservation;\nyet because it is at least possible that virtually anything might be\njudged necessary for one\u2019s preservation, this theoretically\nlimited right of nature becomes in practice an unlimited right to\npotentially anything, or, as Hobbes puts it, a right \u201cto all\nthings\u201d. Hobbes further assumes as a principle of practical\nrationality, that people should adopt what they see to be the\nnecessary means to their most important ends.\n",
