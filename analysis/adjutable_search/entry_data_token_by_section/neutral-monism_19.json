    "main_text": "Objections to Neutral Monism || The Dualism Suspicion\n4.6 The Dualism Suspicion\n\nAnother common objection to neutral monism is that it constitutes a\nform of property dualism or dual aspect theory. The argument is\nstraightforward: On the neutral monist picture, physics describes\ncertain relations\u2014namely, the physical ones\u2014among the\nbasic entities without capturing their intrinsic qualities, or those\nof the complexes of which they are parts. These latter features are\nrevealed to us only in the case of our sensations, percepts, and other\nmental episodes. This suggests that the basic entities exhibit two\nfundamentally different kinds of aspects or properties: extrinsic\nphysical relations and intrinsic mental qualities. But there\u2019s\nnothing properly neutral about either kind of feature, and\nneither is reducible to the other. At best, they are two radically\ndifferent aspects of an underlying reality which, in itself, is\nneither mental nor physical.\n\nThe theory of dual or double aspects is usually traced back to Spinoza\n(1677). The fundamental idea uniting the family of views under this\nlabel is that there is an underlying reality that we can grasp as\nmental or as physical, depending on the point of view from which we\napprehend it. Each one of us can know their own brain under each of\nthese aspects\u2014via introspection and (scientific) observation.\nBut the claim of the theory is quite general: everything there is is\nto be understood as consisting of an underlying reality that has these\ntwo aspects.\n\nNeutral monism and the dual-aspect theory share a central claim: there\nis an underlying reality that is neither mental nor physical. But that\nis where the agreement stops. Neutral monism has no room for the\ncentral feature of the dual-aspect theory: the mental and physical\naspects, sides, or properties that characterize the underlying\nentities of dual-aspect theory. The neutral monist accepts the\nmental/physical distinction. But it resides at the level or groups of\nneutral entities. Grouped one way, the neutral entities constituting\nyour brain are thoughts and feelings; grouped another way, they are\natoms and neurons and lobes. Whether a given group of interrelated\nneutral entities counts as mental or physical depends on the\ncausal-functional role this group occupies. But the entities\nthemselves are free of intrinsically mental or physical\naspects/sides/properties. Therein consists their neutrality.\n\nBut if neutrality is understood according to the Both View,\nthe case for identifying neutral monism with dual-aspect theory is\nstrengthened. Much will turn on how the details of the Both\nView are articulated. It must not, for example, be understood as\nproposing the identification of mental and physical properties. For\nthe dual-aspect theory insists that the two aspects are fundamental\nand irreducible to each other. Another question concerns the\nrelationship of the aspects and properties. If aspects are understood\nas properties, dual-aspect theory may simply collapse into property\ndualism (see, e.g., Van Gulick 2014). Dual-aspect theorists have\npushed back by insisting that aspects are not properties (see Skrbina\n2014: 228\u201329). But this may, in turn, block the project of\nreconciling the dual-aspect theory with neutral monism. For the\nneutrality, on the Both as well as on the Neither\nView, is understood in terms of mental and physical\nproperties.\n\nThere is a lively debate concerning the relationship between neutral\nmonism, property dualism, and dual-aspect theory (see, e.g., Velmans\n2008; Skrbina 2014). The decision about these theories\u2014whether\nthey are identical, distinct but compatible, or incompatible\nrivals\u2014is still out.\n",
