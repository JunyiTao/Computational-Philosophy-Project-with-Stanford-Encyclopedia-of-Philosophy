(Marcel 1951a, p. 181)\n\n\nThe word \u201cwith,\u201d taken with its full metaphysical\nimplication, corresponds neither to a relationship of separation and\nexteriority, nor to a relationship of unity and inherence. Rather,\n\u201cwith\u201d expresses the essence of genuine coesse,\ni.e. of pluralism, of separation with communion (Marcel 1995, p. 39).\nAs indisponibilit\u00e9 is illustrated with the example of\npride, disponibilit\u00e9 is best illustrated in the\nrelations of love, hope and fidelity.\n\nMarcel\u2014contra Kant\u2014does not shy away from declaring that\nthe participation in a relationship \u201cwith\u201d someone has a\nsignificant affective element. It is not knowledge of the other that\ninitially binds us to another person\u2014though we may indeed grow\nto know something of the other\u2014but \u201cfraternity,\u201d the\nsense that the other is beset by joys and sorrows common to the human\n family.[10]\n It is that which allows us, upon seeing the misfortune of another, to\nsay, \u201cThere, but for the grace of God, go I.\u201d To go to\nsomeone\u2019s side or to assist another out of a sense of\n\u201cduty\u201d is precisely not to be present to her.\n [11]\n The person who is disponible does not demure from saying\nthat she truly does desire the best for the other person and that she\ntruly desires to share something of herself with the other (Marcel\n1964, p. 154). In fact, because disponibilit\u00e9 is only\na philosophical way of describing what we mean by love and trust,\ndisponibilit\u00e9 is inconceivable without this affective\nelement.\n\nYet, it is not enough for one person to be disponible in\norder for the full communion of disponibilit\u00e9 to\noccur. It is entirely possible for one person to come to an encounter\nin a completely open and available manner, only to be rebuffed by the\ntotal unavailability of the other person. Ideally, a relationship of\navailability must include an element of reciprocity. However, the fact\nthat reciprocity is necessary in an intersubjective relationship does\nnot mean that reciprocity may be demanded of such a relationship.\nDisponibilit\u00e9 does not insist on its rights or make\nany claim on the other whatsoever. It is analogous to the situation of\n\u201ca being awaiting a gift or favor from another being but only on\nthe grounds of his liberality, and that he is the first to protest\nthat the favor he is asking is a grace [que cette gr\u00e2ce\ndemand\u00e9e est une gr\u00e2ce], that is to say the exact\nopposite of an obligation\u201d (Marcel 1962a, p. 55). Nevertheless,\nthe fact that disponibilit\u00e9 does not demand\nreciprocity and that some kind of relationship is indeed possible\nwithout such reciprocity does not alter the fact that such reciprocity\nmust be present if the relationship is to fully flower. \u201cOne\nmight therefore say that there is a hierarchy of choices, or rather\ninvocations, ranging from the call upon another which is like ringing\na bell for a servant to quite the other sort of call which is really\nlike a kind of prayer\u201d (Marcel 1951a, p. 179).\n\nMarcel characterizes disponibilit\u00e9 as charity bound up\nwith presence, as the gift of oneself. And therefore, at the extreme\nlimit, disponibilit\u00e9 would consist in a total\nspiritual availability that would be pure charity, unconditional love\nand disposability. However, a problem arises here insofar as Marcel\nhas insisted on an affective element in disponibilit\u00e9.\nHow is such a gift of self possible for temporal beings, persons for\nwhom the vicissitudes of time may alter feelings or opinion of the\nother?\n",
