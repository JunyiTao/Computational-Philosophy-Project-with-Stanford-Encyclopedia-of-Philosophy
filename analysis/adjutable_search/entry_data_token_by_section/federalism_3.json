    "main_text": "History of Federalism || Western contributions\n2.2 Western contributions\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BC) provides an early Western example of\nfederal thought, where some of the member units are not political. The\ntasks of households and villages is to secure individuals\u2019\nnecessities of life. The city-state (polis) is a\nself-sufficient community of such households, clans and villages, for\nprotection and fulfilment (Politics, III.9, 1280b).\n\nSeveral of the early European contributors to federalist thought\nexplored the rationale and weaknesses of centralised states as they\nemerged and developed in the 17th and 18th century. Johannes Althusius\n(1557\u20131630) is often regarded as the father of modern federalist\nthought. He argued in Politica Methodice Digesta (Althusius\n1603) for autonomy of his city Emden, both against its Lutheran\nprovincial Lord and against the Catholic Emperor. Althusius was\nstrongly influenced by French Huguenots and Calvinism. As a permanent\nminority in several states, Calvinists developed a doctrine of\nresistance as the right and duty of \u201cnatural leaders\u201d to\nresist tyranny. Orthodox Calvinists insisted on sovereignty in the\nsocial circles subordinate only to God\u2019s laws. The French\nProtestant Huguenots developed a theory of legitimacy further,\npresented 1579 by an author with the telling pseudonym \u201cJunius\nBrutus\u201d in Vindiciae Contra Tyrannos. The people,\nregarded as a corporate body in territorial hierarchical communities,\nhas a God-granted right to resist rulers without rightful claim.\nRejecting theocracy, Althusius developed a non-sectarian,\nnon-religious contractualist political theory of federations that\nprohibited state intervention even for purposes of promoting the right\nfaith. Accommodation of dissent and diversity prevailed over any\ninterest in subordinating political powers to religion or vice\nversa.\n\nSince humans are fundamentally dependent on others for the reliable\nprovision of requirements of a comfortable and holy life, we require\ncommunities and associations that are both instrumentally and\nintrinsically important for supporting [subsidia] our needs.\nAlthusius, like Aristotle, included non-political units in his federal\ntheory. Families, guilds, cities, provinces, states and other\nassociations owe their legitimacy and claims to political power to\ntheir various roles in enabling a holy life, rather than to\nindividuals\u2019 interest in autonomy. Each association claims\nautonomy within its own sphere against intervention by other\nassociations. Borrowing a term originally used for the alliance\nbetween God and men, Althusius holds that associations enter into\nsecular agreements\u2014pactum foederis\u2014to live\ntogether in mutual benevolence.\n\nSeveral early contributors explored what we may now regard as various\nspecies of federal political orders, partly with an eye to resolving\ninter-state conflicts.\n\nLudolph Hugo (ca. 1630\u20131704) was the first to distinguish\nconfederations based on alliances, decentralized unitary states such\nas the Roman Empire, and federations, characterized by \u2018double\ngovernments\u2019 with territorial division of powers, in De\nStatu Regionum Germanie (1661) (cf. Elazar 1998; Riley 1976).\n\nA recurring concern was tensions between federalism and conceptions of\nsovereignty. Samuel Pufendorf (1632\u20131684) maintained that\nsovereign states could at most \u201cagree to intertwine for all\ntime\u201d in a confederation deciding by unanimity. Move to majority\nrule turned the legal order into an \u2018irregular system\u2019\ncloser to a state. If sovereignty is a unique site of final and\nindependent authority, federations are no more than voluntary treaties\namong fundamentally independent states, argued Emmerik Vattel\n(1714\u20131767). Later thinkers challenged this understanding of\nsovereignty, in debates continuing to this day concerning the European\nUnion. (MacCormick 1999, Sch\u00fctze 2009).\n\nIn The Spirit of Laws (1748) Charles de Secondat, Baron de\nMontesquieu (1689\u20131755) argued for confederal arrangements as\ncombining the best of small and large political units, without the\ndisadvantages of either. On the one hand they could provide the\nadvantages of small states such as republican participation and\nliberty understood as non-domination\u2014that is, security against\nabuse of power. At the same time confederal orders secure the benefits\nof larger states such as military security, without the risks of small\nand large states. A \u2018confederate republic\u2019 with separation\nof powers allows sufficient homogeneity and identification within\nsufficiently small member units. The member units in turn pool powers\nsufficient to secure external security, reserving the right to secede\n(Book 9, 1). Member units serve as checks on each other, since other\nmember units may intervene to quell insurrection and power abuse in\none member unit. These themes reoccur in later contributions, up to\nand including discussions concerning the European Union (cf. Levy\n2004, 2005, 2007).\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u20131776) disagreed with Montesquieu that smaller\nsize is better. Instead, \u201cin a large democracy \u2026 there is\ncompass and room enough to refine the democracy.\u201d In \u201cIdea\nof a Perfect Commonwealth\u201d (Hume 1752) Hume recommended a\nfederal arrangement for deliberation of laws involving both member\nunit and central legislatures. Member units enjoy several powers and\npartake in central decisions, but their laws and court judgments can\nalways be overruled by the central bodies, hence it seems that\nHume\u2019s model is not federal as the term is used here. He held\nthat such a numerous and geographically large system would do better\nthan small cities in preventing decisions based on \u201cintrigue,\nprejudice or passion\u201d against the public interest.\n\nSeveral 18th century peace plans for Europe recommended confederal\narrangements. The 1713 Peace Plan of Abb\u00e9 Charles de\nSaint-Pierre (1658\u20131743) would allow intervention in member\nunits to quell rebellion and wars on non-members to force them to join\nan established confederation, and required unanimity for changes to\nthe agreement.\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u20131778) presented and critiqued\nSaint-Pierre\u2019s proposal, listing several conditions including\nthat all major powers must be members, that the joint legislation must\nbe binding, that the joint forces must be stronger than any single\nstate, and that secession must be illegal. Again, unanimity was\nrequired for changes to the agreement.\n\nImmanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) defended a confederation for peace in\nOn Perpetual Peace (1796). His Second Definite Article of a\nPerpetual Peace holds that the right of nations shall be based on a\npacific federation among free states rather than a peace treaty or an\ninternational state: \u201cThis federation does not aim to acquire\nany power like that of a state, but merely to preserve and secure the\nfreedom of each state in itself, along with that of the other\nconfederated states, although this does not mean that they need to\nsubmit to public laws and to a coercive power which enforces them, as\ndo men in a state of nature.\u201d\n\nThe discussions surrounding the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787\nmarks a clear development in federal thought, also as regards the\ntensions between unitary sovereignty and divided authority. One\ncentral feature is that federations were seen as uniting not only\nmember units as in confederations, but also the citizenry\ndirectly.\n\nThe Articles of Confederation of 1781 among the 13 American states\nfighting British rule had established a center too weak for law\nenforcement, defense and for securing interstate commerce. What has\nbecome known as the U.S. Constitutional Convention met May\n25\u2013September 17, 1787. It was explicitly restricted to revise\nthe Articles, but ended up recommending more fundamental changes. The\nproposed constitution prompted widespread debate and arguments\naddressing the benefits and risks of federalism versus confederal\narrangements, leading eventually to the Constitution that took effect\nin 1789.\n\nThe \u201cAnti-federalists\u201d were fearful of undue\ncentralization. They worried that the powers of central authorities\nwere not sufficiently constrained e.g., by a bill of rights (John\nDeWitt 1787) that was eventually ratified in 1791. They also feared\nthat the center might gradually usurp the member units\u2019 powers.\nCiting Montesquieu, another pseudonymous \u2018Brutus\u2019 doubted\nwhether a republic of such geographical size with so many inhabitants\nwith conflicting interests could avoid tyranny and would allow common\ndeliberation and decision based on local knowledge (Brutus (Robert\nYates?) 1787).\n\nIn The Federalist Papers, James Madison (1751\u20131836),\nAlexander Hamilton (1755\u20131804) and John Jay (1745\u20131829)\nargued vigorously for the suggested model of interlocking federal\narrangements (Federalist 10, 45, 51, 62). Madison and Hamilton agreed\nwith Hume that the risk of tyranny by passionate majorities was\nreduced in larger republics where member units of shared interest\ncould and would check each other: \u201cA rage for paper money, for\nan abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any\nimproper or wicked project, will be less likely to pervade the whole\nbody of the Union than a particular member of it.\u201d (Federalist\n10). Splitting sovereignty between member unit and center would also\nprotect individuals\u2019 rights against abuse by authorities at\neither level, or so believed Hamilton, quoting Montesquieu at length\nto this effect (Federalist 9).\n\nNoting the problems of allocating powers correctly, Madison supported\nplacing some authority with member units since they would be best fit\nto address \u201clocal circumstances and lesser interests\u201d\notherwise neglected by the center (Federalist 37).\n\nMadison and Hamilton urged centralized powers of defense and\ninterstate commerce (Federalist 11, 23), and argued for the need to\nsolve coordination and assurance problems of partial compliance,\nthrough two new means: Centralized enforcement and direct\napplicability of central decisions to individuals (Federalist 16, also\nnoted by Tocqueville 1835\u201340). They were wary of granting member\nunits veto power typical of confederal arrangements, since that would\nrender the center weak and cause \u201ctedious delays; continual\nnegotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public\ngood.\u201d (Madison and Hamilton, Federalist 22; and cf. 20).\n\nThey were particularly concerned to address worries of undue\ncentralization, arguing that such worries should be addressed not by\nconstraining the extent of power in the relevant fields, such as\ndefense, but instead by the composition of the central authority\n(Federalist 31). They also claimed that the people would maintain\nstronger \u201caffection, esteem, and reverence\u201d towards the\nmember unit government owing to its public visibility in the\nday-to-day administration of criminal and civil justice (Federalist\n17).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), in chapter 17 of\nConsiderations on Representative Government (1861),\nrecommended federations among \u201cportions of mankind\u201d not\ndisposed to live under a common government, to prevent wars among\nthemselves and protect against aggression. He would also allow the\ncenter sufficient powers so as to ensure all benefits of\nunion\u2014including powers to prevent frontier duties to facilitate\ncommerce. He listed three necessary conditions for a federation:\nsufficient mutual sympathy \u201cof race, language, religion, and,\nabove all, of political institutions, as conducing most to a feeling\nof identity of political interest\u201d; no member unit so powerful\nas to not require union for defense nor tempt unduly to secession; and\nrough equality of strength among member units to prevent internal\ndomination by one or two. Mill also claimed among the benefits of\nfederations that they reduce the number of weak states hence reduce\ntemptation to aggression, ending wars and restrictions on commence\namong member units; and that federations are less aggressive, only\nusing their power defensively. Further benefits from\nfederations\u2014and from decentralized authority in\ngeneral\u2014might include learning from \u2018experiments in\nliving\u2019.\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809\u20131865), in Du Principe\nf\u00e9d\u00e9ratif (1863) defended federalism as the best\nway to retain individual liberty within \u2018natural\u2019\ncommunities such as families and guilds who enter pacts among\nthemselves for necessary and specific purposes. The state is only one\nof several non-sovereign agents in charge of coordinating, without\nfinal authority.\n\nWhile Proudhon was wary of centralisation, authors such as Harold\nLaski warned of \u2018The Obsolesence of Federalism\u2019 (1939).\nThe important problems, such as those wrought by \u2018giant\ncapitalism,\u2019 require more centralised responses than federal\narrangements can muster.\n\nPhilosophical reflections on federalism were invigorated during and\nafter the Second World War, for several reasons. Altiero Spinelli and\nErnesto Rossi called for a European federal state in the Ventotene\nManifesto, published 1944. They condemned totalitarian,\ncentralised states and the never ending conflicts among them. Instead\nthere should be enough shared control over military and economic\npower, yet \u201ceach State will retain the autonomy it needs for a\nplastic articulation and development of political life according to\nthe particular characteristics of the various peoples.\u201d Many\nexplain and justify the European Union along precisely these lines,\nwhile others are more critical.\n\nHannah Arendt (1906\u20131975) traced both totalitarianism and\nindustrialized mass murder to flaws in the sovereign nation-state\nmodel. Skeptical both of liberal internationalism and political\nrealism, she instead urged a Republican federal model or ideal type\nwherein \u201cthe federated units mutually check and control their\npowers\u201d (Arendt 1972).\n\nThe exit of colonial powers also left multi-ethnic states that\nrequired creative solutions to combine self rule and shared rule\n(Karmis and Norman 2005). In addition, globalisation has prompted not\nonly integration and harmonisation, but also\u2014partly in\nresponse\u2014explorations of ways to still maintain some local self\nrule (Watts 1998).\n\nDevelopments of the European Union and backlash against its particular\nforms of political and legal integration is one major cause of renewed\nattention to the philosophy of federalism. Recent philosophical\ndiscussions have addressed several issues, including centrally the\nreasons for federalism, and attention to the sources of stability and\ninstability; the legitimate division of power between member unit and\ncenter; distributive justice, challenges to received democratic\ntheory, and concerns about the politics of recognition.\n",
