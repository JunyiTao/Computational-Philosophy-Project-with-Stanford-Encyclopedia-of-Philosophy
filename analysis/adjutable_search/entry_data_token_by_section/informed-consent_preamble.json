    "main_text": "\n\nInformed consent is currently treated as the core of bioethics. In\nclinical practice, the doctrine of informed consent rose to dominance\nduring the course of the 20th century. It replaced a medical ethos\nfounded on trust in physicians\u2019 decisions, often on the\nassumption that \u201cdoctor knows best\u201d, with an ethos that\nsought to put patients in charge of their own care. In medical\nresearch, the influential Nuremberg Code responded to the cruelty of\nNazi experiments stipulating: \u201cThe voluntary consent of the\nhuman subject is absolutely essential\u201d. But why should we\nrequire informed consent, e.g. when it comes at a cost to the\nindividual\u2019s health? What is the content, the scope, and the\nstatus of that requirement? How does informed consent in bioethics,\nthe focus of the present entry, relate to consent in sexual ethics,\nbusiness ethics, and political philosophy?\n",
