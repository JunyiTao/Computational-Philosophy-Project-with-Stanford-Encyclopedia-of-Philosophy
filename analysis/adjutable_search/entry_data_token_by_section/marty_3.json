    "main_text": "Language || The Origin of Language\n3.1 The Origin of Language\n\nThough Marty did, as already indicated, focus much of his work on the\ndescription of language as it is, his first book On the Origin of\nLanguage (Marty 1875) was concerned with its origin. In this\nbook, Marty already applies some of the main ideas of his later\ndescriptive semasiology (see the following section) to refute two\nopposing views on the origin of language \u2013 nativism and\nempiricism \u2013 and to establish his own alternative, more\nteologically oriented explanation of the beginnings of language.\n\u201cNativism\u201d was represented especially by Heymann\nSteinthal, Moritz Lazarus, and Wilhelm Wundt, (See also the lengthy\nappendix against Wundt in Marty 1908a, 543\u2013738) \u2013 and goes\nback to Wilhelm Humboldt\u2019s concept of unconscious and inborn\nlanguage instinct and to his view of the essential relation of\nthinking to speaking. Nativism claims that language develops out of\nsound-producing reflexes and associations of these sounds with certain\nsensations and images. Thus, on the nativist view, language as the\npurposeful manifestation of inner life arose from behavior which was\noriginally altogether unintended (Marty 1875, 19). In other words,\nlanguage is originally \u201cnative\u201d and not something created\nor \u201cinvented\u201d in human conscious activity.\n\u201cEmpiricism\u201d, represented by Herbart, Grimm, Lotze, and\nWhitney, denies necessary connection of thinking to speaking as well\nas all inborn relations between certain thoughts and certain\narticulated sounds (Marty 1875, 44\u201345). Marty cannot accept\nnativism for the complete lack of empirical evidence in its favor and\ndiscusses many conceptual confusions on its part (Marty 1875,\n18\u201343). While he feels much more at home in the camp of\nempiricism and shares its critical stance toward nativism, he insists\nthat language is teleological in character rather than mechanistic and\nis of course supported by the psychology of intentionality. Marty\nmaintains that language originated from the basic human need to\ncommunicate and cooperate and was purposeful from the outset. This\nneed motivated conscious, but unplanned and unreflected formation of\nsyntactic forms and lexical means for purposeful externalization of\ninner life through articulated signs. Moreover, he uses associative\nmechanisms to explain origins of syntactic forms of language and to\ndescribe how new syntactic forms and vocabulary were suggested and\nbrought about by using already established meanings of expressions in\nnew contexts (see also the explanation of Marty\u2019s concept of\ninner form below). Marty later published a series of ten articles\n\u201cOn Speech Reflex, Nativism, and Purposeful Formation of\nLanguage\u201d (Marty 1884b, Marty 1886, Marty 1889, Marty 1890,\nMarty 1891, Marty 1892a) in which he continued to defend his this view\nand engaged in extensive polemics against new formulations of the\nopposing views. These views were in large measure developed out of\nHerbartian psychological theories and also meshed in with the whole\nprogram of a \u201cpsychology of peoples\u201d\n(V\u00f6lkerpsychologie). Much of the psychology, including\nalleged observations of children and so-called primitive people, used\nto support nativism is on his view highly erroneous. Marty\u2019s\ndefense of his theory in opposition to nativism involves descriptive\nsemasiology, which was to be developed more fully in his subsequent\nwritings, especially his main work, and is indeed the center piece of\nhis philosophical endeavors.\n",
