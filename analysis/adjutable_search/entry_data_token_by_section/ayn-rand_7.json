Rationality, \n\n\none\u2019s total commitment \u2026 to the maintenance of a full\nmental focus in all issues, in all choices \u2026 to the fullest\nperception of reality within one\u2019s power, (1961b: 28) \n\n\nis the basic virtue of which the other virtues are aspects or\nderivatives. The virtues are thus united or reciprocal. Each virtue is\ndefined partly in terms of a recognition of, and appropriate\nresponsiveness to, some important fact or facts, a recognition and\nresponsiveness understood by the agent to be indispensable for\ngaining, maintaining, or expressing her ultimate value. For example,\nintegrity is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake\nyour consciousness\u201d (1957 [1992]: 936), a recognition that is\nexpressed in loyalty to one\u2019s rational values and convictions,\nespecially in the face of social pressures to surrender them (1961b:\n28; 1964a: 52, 80); honesty is \u201cthe recognition of the fact that\nyou cannot fake existence\u201d, a recognition that is expressed in\ntruthfulness in thought and speech (1957 [1992]: 936\u201337); and\njustice is \n\n\nthe recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men\nas you cannot fake the character of nature, \u2026 that every man\nmust be judged for what he is and treated\naccordingly\u2026. (1957 [1992]: 937)\n\n\nConspicuous by their absence from Rand\u2019s list of the cardinal\nvirtues are the \u201cvirtues of benevolence\u201d, such as\nkindness, charity, generosity, and forgiveness. Rand states that\ncharity is not a major virtue or moral duty (1964b); likewise,\npresumably, kindness, generosity, and forgiveness. Whether, and how\nmuch, one should help others depends on their place in one\u2019s\nrationally defined hierarchy of values, and on the particular\ncircumstances (whether they are worthy of help, what the likely\nconsequences are of helping them, and so on). The greater their value\nvis-\u00e0-vis one\u2019s rational self-interest, the\ngreater the help that one should be willing to give, ceteris\nparibus. What is never morally appropriate is to make a\nsacrifice, that is, to surrender something of value to oneself for the\nsake of something of less or no value to oneself. Thus, it can never\nbe moral to knowingly risk one\u2019s life for a stranger (unless, of\ncourse, one\u2019s life is no longer worth living) or to court\nunhappiness for the happiness of another, whether stranger or\nfriend. It is appropriate to help a stranger only in an emergency, and\nonly when the risk to our own life or well-being is minimal (1963c:\n43\u201345).  This should not be taken to imply that helping a\nstranger is always morally optional, regardless of the\ncircumstances. Indeed, people who are \u201ctotally indifferent to\nanything living and would not lift a finger to help a man or a dog\nleft mangled by a hit-and-run driver\u201d are\n\u201cpsychopaths\u201d (1963c: 43\u201345) Rand makes even more\nconcessions to \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d when she states\nthat it\u2019s good to help a neighbor going through a hard time till\nhe can get back on his own feet, if we can afford to and if we have no\nreason to think that he is undeserving. Charity understood thus is a\nvirtue because it is an expression of the generalized good will and\nrespect that all normal people have towards others as creatures who\nshare with them the capacity to value (1963c: 46\u201347). Nathaniel\nBranden tries to reconcile charity with egoism by declaring that the\nformer stems from a species-identification with another, such that, in\nrevering others, people \u201care revering their own life\u201d. By\nacting charitably, people actualize this sense of kinship, without\nsacrificing their own well-being.\n\nThis last is true, but the desire to reduce all proper motivations to\negoistic motivations leads Branden (and Rand and many Objectivists) to\nignore the fact that charity is first and foremost profoundly\nother-regarding, prompted by another\u2019s plight rather than\nconcern for one\u2019s own self-actualization. The same is true of\ntrying to rescue a dog mangled by a hit-and-run driver, where the\negoistic motivation must be even weaker, since here there is no\nspecies-identification, but rather only a\n\u201cgenus-identification\u201d with another sufferer. The\nproblem with Rand and Branden\u2019s ethical egoism can be sharpened\nby asking why we should not harm others, for example, by spitefully\nstepping on their gouty toes. Rand and Branden\u2019s answer has to\nbe: because doing so will harm us. But why will it harm us? Because we\nhave unjustly and irrationally hurt another out of spite, and\ninjustice and irrationality are bad for us. But our action\nwouldn\u2019t be unjust and irrational if it didn\u2019t hurt them\n\u2013 if, in fact, stepping on their toes cured their gout and we\ndid it for that reason. Clearly, then, the wrongness of our action and\nmotivation depends, in the first instance, on what we know it will do\nto our victims. This is why we ought to apologize to them, and not to\nourselves. It\u2019s right and important to consider the effect on\nourselves of being spiteful, unjust, and irrational, but there is no\ngood argument for the view that we ought to be just to others only or\nprimarily because it is good for us. All other-regarding virtues are\nresponses to other people\u2019s moral standing.\n\n\nAt any rate, the argument from identification can also be used to\njustify charity towards strangers in non-emergency situations, for\nexample, towards those who are permanently disabled and unable to care\nfor themselves (Badhwar forthcoming). Rand concedes as much in\n\u201cWhat is Capitalism?\u201d (1965) where she argues that people\nwho are unable to work must rely on voluntary charity, thus implying\nthat it is proper for those who can afford it to support strangers in\nnon-emergency situations. And indeed, as recent scholarship has\nrevealed, in her own life Rand was often extremely generous, not only\ntowards friends and acquaintances, but also\nstrangers.[7]\n\nThe question arises why Rand thinks that charity, kindness etc. are\nnot major virtues when they meet all the conditions of\nappropriateness: the recipient is worthy of help, one can afford to\nhelp, it is in one\u2019s rational self-interest (or not contrary to\nit) to help, and so on. Perhaps Rand thinks that they are\n\u201cminor\u201d virtues because we are not obligated to act on\nthem at all times, the way we are obligated to act justly and honestly\nat all times. A deeper reason, however, might be her conception of\npeople as essentially agents rather than patients, doers rather than\nreceivers, self-sufficient rather than dependent. Nevertheless,\nRand\u2019s view of the unity of the virtues dictates that, even if\nwe are not obligated to act on charity, kindness etc. at all\ntimes, they are just as important to possess as the other\nvirtues. Moreover, in keeping with her emphasis on the importance of\ngoodwill towards others and \u201cthe benevolent universe\npremise\u201d, Rand\u2019s heroes are often extraordinarily (and\nalmost always appropriately) kind and generous, not only towards those\nthey love but also towards mere acquaintances, and even sometimes\nadversaries.  Striking examples include, from The\nFountainhead, Howard Roark\u2019s unsought-for attempt to give\nhope and courage to Steven Mallory, the gifted young sculptor whose\nfailure to get work has driven him to the verge of a spiritual and\nphysical collapse, and Roark\u2019s unreproachful help to his\nerstwhile adversary, Peter Keating, when Keating falls on hard\ntimes. In Atlas Shrugged, Dagny offers support to a\nheart-broken and despairing Cheryl Taggart who, in the past, has\ntreated Dagny with scorn, and Hank Rearden generously supports his\nexploitative family before he realizes their \nexploitativeness.[8]\nRand\u2019s implicit recognition that kindness and generosity are important\nvirtues is shown also in her depiction of her villains as lacking all\nkindness and generosity.\n\nJust as rationality, a focus on reality, is at the heart of every\nvirtue, so irrationality, evasion of reality (including\nself-deception), is at the heart of every vice. Rand\u2019s villains\nare all master evaders motivated by a desire for power, social status,\nfame, or unearned wealth, and resentment of the good. They are\n\u201csecond-handers\u201d\u2014people whose primary relationship\nis to other people rather than to reality. Between the virtuous and\nthe vicious are the \u201cinnocently wrong\u201d, people who adopt\nwrong moral principles or make wrong choices, not through evasion but\nthrough an error of judgment (Rand does not explicitly recognize any\nmoral category other than virtue, vice, and moral error, although her\nnovels portray characters that do not easily fit into any of these\ncategories). Hank Rearden, in Atlas Shrugged, is the great\ninnocent living under a burden of unearned guilt because of his\nmistaken sense of honor and a family interested only in manipulating\nand using him. Cheryl Taggart is killed by the too-sudden revelation\nthat the man she loved and admired as the embodiment of her ideals is\na fraud\u2014and that the world is full of such frauds.\n\nAs already indicated, Rand justifies virtue in both instrumental and\nnon-instrumental terms, though without distinguishing between them.\nThe instrumental arguments show the existential and psychological\nrewards of virtue and costs of vice. In her depiction of her heroes,\nRand shows her conviction that virtue creates an inner harmony and\nserenity. Virtue also makes one trustworthy, and thus enables mutually\nbeneficial interactions with others.  Evasiveness, by contrast, traps\none in a \u201ctangled web\u201d of rationalizations and\npretenses. The evader who deceives others is either eventually caught,\nor lives in fear of getting caught, becoming dependent on\nothers\u2019 unconsciousness. He is \u201ca fool\u201d, says a\ncharacter in Atlas Shrugged, \u201cwhose source of values is\nthe fools he succeeds in fooling\u201d (1957 [1992]: 945). Further,\nlike Sartre, Rand holds that no evasion is completely successful,\nbecause the truth constantly threatens to resurface. Hence, the\nevader\u2019s \u201cdiseased soul\u201d is in a state of constant\ninner conflict and anxiety as he tries to suppress his awareness of\nuncomfortable truths while maintaining his hold on others. His lack of\nintegrity and of esteem for reality results in a lack of self-love or\nself-esteem and, indeed, of a solid self. (It is noteworthy, however,\nthat Rand\u2019s portrayal of Gail Wynand in The Fountainhead is\ncloser to Aristotle\u2019s portrayal of the vicious man in Book III\nof the Nicomachean Ethics as someone who is\n\u201cunconscious of his vice\u201d than to her own stated view of\nthe evader.)\n\nThese views are familiar from the history of philosophy, but many\nreaders find their expression in Rand\u2019s novels to be of unusual\npsychological depth and conviction. Nevertheless, the views are\nsubject to the well-known objection that the complexity and\nvariability of human psychology and society allow only \u201cfor the\nmost part\u201d generalizations about the existential and\npsychological benefits of virtue or costs of vice. For example, it is\npossible for a small injustice to lead to great rewards, especially\nsince others are willing to shrug off or forgive occasional\ntransgressions. It is also possible for poor introspection,\nforgetfulness, or self-acceptance to allow one to evade something\nwithout any need for supporting evasions or damage to one\u2019s\nself-esteem. Again, even if every wrongdoing carries psychological\ncosts, these might sometimes be outweighed by the long-term\npsychological and existential costs of doing the right thing (as Rand\nherself suggests in her portrayal of the embittered Henry Cameron and\nStephen Mallory in The Fountainhead).\n\nThe non-instrumentalist justification of virtue in Rand\u2019s novels\nis largely immune to these objections (though subject to the\nobjections noted in 2.4 above). To\ncompromise morally is, necessarily, to compromise one\u2019s own\n(objectively conceived) happiness, because no existential loss can\ncompare to the loss of moral integrity. Rectitude is partly\nconstitutive of genuine happiness because it expresses the right\nrelationship to reality: to existence, to oneself, and to others. For\nthe same reason, it is partly constitutive of a self worth loving, an\nideally human or rational self. Any value gained at the price of\nrectitude is only the simulacrum of genuine value. In a variety of\nconceptually interconnected ways, then, virtuous individuals are\nnecessarily better off than those willing to take moral short-cuts. In\nits structure and much of its content, Rand\u2019s ethical egoism is\nthus of a piece with the egoism of ancient eudaimonistic\ntheories.\n\nOf course, this non-instrumentalist justification of virtue depends on\nthe prior instrumentalist justification, viz., that in normal\ncircumstances (that is, in a society of more or less virtuous people),\nvirtue enables us to gain both external and psychological goods. If\njustice or kindness were systematically bad for human beings, leading\nto disease and death, they would not be virtues. If rationality\nroutinely led to an early demise, no one would value rationality. But\nthis does not entail, as Salmieri seems to think, that the ultimate\nvalue is literal survival (Salmieri 2019). All it entails is that the\nvirtues be compatible with survival in normal\ncircumstances. For it is easy to see that if justice or kindness\nsystematically led to deep depression, and rationality routinely\nsucked the joy out of life, only the rare misery-lover would value his\nlife, or the virtues. Survival is a necessary condition of a happy\nlife (as well as an unhappy one), not an ultimate value. And\nit\u2019s only because the virtues lead to, and partly constitute, a\nhappy (eudaimonic) life, that a virtuous person considers it a greater\nloss to betray his principles than to lose the work he loves \u2013\nor, sometimes, even his life. One of the best examples of this from\nRand\u2019s own work is Howard Roark\u2019s decision to act out of\nintegrity, even at the cost of being unable to practice architecture\n(The Fountainhead). Another example concerns two minor\ncharacters in We The Living who risk \u2013 and lose \u2013\ntheir freedom and lives for resisting the new communist regime. (Note,\nhowever, that Rand does not think that we are morally obligated to\nmartyr ourselves to fight evil. All we are obligated to do is not be\ncomplicit in evil, or betray our values.)\n\nEven on this indirect, sophisticated egoism, where the good to the\nagent lies in being virtuous, Rand\u2019s theory is open to the objection\noften levied against egoistic theories, viz., that they give the wrong\nreason for acting in other-regarding ways \u2013 justly, kindly, etc. My\nact does not adequately express the virtue of justice if I give you\nyour due solely or primarily because acting justly is good for me\nrather than because I recognize and respect your moral standing, your\nentitlement to be treated justly. Nor does my helping you when you\nneed help adequately express goodwill or kindness if I help you solely\nor primarily because acting benevolently is good for me. One way out\ntaken by some other theories is to argue that the\negoist\u2019s justification is egoistic but not\nher motivation. Rand does not address the\n\u201cwrong-reason\u201d objection, but there is no hint in her\nwritings that she would accept this dichotomy between justification\nand motivation. The root of the problem is that, although Rand rejects\npsychological egoism, she seems to regard genuine goodwill towards, or\nlove of, others as an offshoot of proper self-love, as though there\nwere no independent source of love for others in human nature. This is\nwhere her metaethics and ethics differ most starkly from that of\nAristotle. \n",
