    "main_text": "Murdoch\u2019s Trajectory and Reception\n2. Murdoch\u2019s Trajectory and Reception\n\nMurdoch taught at Oxford from 1948\u20131963 (as both tutor and\nlecturer), and was highly regarded by colleagues, often appearing in\ncollections and BBC programs with leading British philosophers\ngenerally though not always in the analytic or linguistic tradition.\nShe was comfortable with the analytic approach, though her thinking\nwas clearly headed in different directions, in part because of the\ninfluence of Simone Weil (Broackes 2012a: 19\u201320).\n\nHowever, unusual for Oxford philosophers of that period, she was also\ndrawn to Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s existentialism, to which she had\nbeen exposed while working after the war in Belgium (and Austria) for\nthe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA).\nHer first book, in 1953, was Sartre: Romantic Rationalist.\nShe was instrumental in bringing French thinkers of that period,\nincluding also Simone de Beauvoir, the feminist/existentialist, and\nAlbert Camus, to an English-speaking audience.\n\nMurdoch left her position at Oxford in 1963 (though she continued to\nlive in Oxford for some of each week) and increasingly lost touch with\nBritish academic philosophy. As of this writing, Murdoch is best known\nfor a collection of three essays written in the 1960s, none originally\npublished in easily accessible philosophy venues, published in 1970 as\nThe Sovereignty of Good. This collection is by far the main\nsource for professional philosophers writing on Murdoch, and of\nMurdoch\u2019s broader impact on moral philosophy, and this entry\nwill draw largely but not exclusively on that work.\n\nToward the end of the 1970s and into the 1980s, some Anglo-American\nphilosophers began to make use of Murdoch in criticizing moral\nphilosophy of the day, or in developing a distinctive position of\ntheir own. This included Charles Taylor, Hilary Putnam, Cora Diamond,\nGenevieve Lloyd, John McDowell, Raimond Gaita, Martha Nussbaum,\nLawrence Blum and Sabina Lovibond. This early secondary literature did\nnot involve deep scholarly engagement with Murdoch\u2019s own work,\nbut was inspired by it and helped bring Murdoch to the attention of\nthe wider professional philosophical world.\n\nA collection of almost all Murdoch\u2019s previous articles\n(including those in Sovereignty) plus a short book on Plato\nwas published in 1997, as Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on\nPhilosophy and Literature, edited by her friend and biographer,\nthe literary scholar Peter Conradi. That and the first scholarly\ncollection on her work, Iris Murdoch and the Search for Human\nGoodness (Antonaccio & Schweiker 1996), with essays by\ntheologians and philosophers (including Diamond, Nussbaum, and Taylor)\nprompted an increase in scholarship directly on Murdoch in the 2000s.\nJustin Broackes\u2019s Iris Murdoch, Philosopher, in 2012,\nwas the first all-philosopher collection on Murdoch. While the recent\nscholarship sometimes aims at demonstrating Murdoch\u2019s relevance\nto current live issues in Anglo-American ethics (Setiya 2013; Hopwood\n2018), increasingly, scholarship (including the two articles just\ncited) engages with Murdoch\u2019s own philosophical\npreoccupations on her terms.\n\nIn 1992, Murdoch published her sole book working out her own\nphilosophical views (Sovereignty being a collection of\nseparately published essays), Metaphysics as a Guide to\nMorals. Murdoch\u2019s views, especially in the latter work,\nhave been difficult for contemporary philosophers to place comfortably\nwithin the intellectual terrain of moral philosophy as it has\ndeveloped in our time, in part because of her unusual range of\nintellectual touchstones; in part because, especially in\nMetaphysics, she seldom writes in a standard\n\u201cargument/conclusion\u201d format; and in part because of her\nintellectual distance from contemporary Anglo-American philosophy.\nThere is currently very little secondary literature on\nMetaphysics, but Dooley and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen\u2019s 2019\ncollection, Reading Iris Murdoch\u2019s Metaphysics as a Guide to\nMorals will hopefully spur further scholarship on that work. A\nRoutledge Handbook, Hopwood and Panizza\u2019s The Murdochian\nMind (forthcoming), will contribute substantially to\nMurdoch scholarship.\n\nMurdoch is distinctive as a philosopher in another way as well.\nBeginning in 1954, she became a published novelist, with twenty-six\nnovels in her lifetime, several of which won or were short-listed for\nimportant British literary prizes. Although her philosophy and her\nnovels can be read entirely separately from one another, they are\nplausibly regarded as connected and mutually illuminating, although in\ninterviews Murdoch sometimes denied this. A good deal of scholarly\nliterature (mostly from literary scholars [but from the philosophy\nside, see Nussbaum 1990; Browning 2018b]) is devoted to exploring\ntheir connection and non-connection. Murdoch is the subject of an\naward-winning biography, Iris: The Life of Iris Murdoch, by\nPeter Conradi (2001), and an award-winning film of that same year,\nIris (dir: Richard Eyre), based on a memoir by\nMurdoch\u2019s husband, John Bayley, which focuses largely on her\ndecline into Alzheimer\u2019s in her last years (Bayley 1999).  The\nIris Murdoch Society publishes (since 2008) a twice-yearly journal,\nthe Iris Murdoch Review (see Other Internet\nResources), that had been almost entirely a venue for scholarship\nand commentary on Murdoch\u2019s literary oeuvre, but recently has\nstarted to carry much more philosophy.\n",
