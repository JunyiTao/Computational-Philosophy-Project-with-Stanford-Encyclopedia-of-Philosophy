    "main_text": "Varieties of Pacifism || Maximal vs. Minimal Pacifism\n2.2 Maximal vs. Minimal Pacifism\n\nThe difference between maximal (or broad) and minimal (or narrow)\npacifism has to do with the extent of the commitment to nonviolence.\nThis difference can be explained with reference to the questions of\nwhat sorts of violence are rejected, and who is the recipient or\nbeneficiary of nonviolent concern. Pacifists reject violence and war.\nBut there is an open question about how war and violence are defined\nand thus about what sorts of actions are rejected by pacifists. There\nis, of course, a continuum between maximal and minimal pacifism, with\nmaximal pacifism rejecting all forms of war and violence. Minimal\nversions of pacifism fall away from this in various directions.\nMaximal pacifism is closely related to absolute and universal\nformulations of pacifism; minimal pacifism has more in common with\ncontingent and particular versions of pacifism.\n\nThere are a variety of actions that can be described as\n\u201cwar\u201d: terrorism, insurgency, civil war, humanitarian\nintervention, full-fledged inter-state conflict, and world war that\nincludes the possible employment of nuclear weapons. Most pacifists\nwill reject nuclear war and full-fledged inter-state conflict. But\nthere are differences about whether, for example, civil war or\nhumanitarian intervention can be justified. For example, some who\ncould be described as pacifists supported the use of military force\nduring the American Civil War (William Lloyd Garrison, for example,\ncompromised his pacifist beliefs to support the cause of emancipating\nthe slaves). At issue in thinking about these differences are\nquestions about the importance of key values such as sovereignty and\nhuman rights, as well as the question of how best to create stability\nin the face of social unrest. One difficult issue for some pacifists\nis the question of using violence in defense of human rights or in\nopposition to tyranny. Maximal pacifists will reject all use of\nmilitary force, even in defense against dictators or in response to\nhuman rights violations.\n\nMaximal versions of pacifism will condemn all taking of life.\nPacifists may also extend their rejection of violence to include a\nrejection of the death penalty, meat-eating, and abortion. More narrow\nversions of pacifism may take into account the distinction between the\ninnocent and the guilty, holding only that the innocent may not be\nharmed. This distinction is important for thinking about the question\nof noncombatant immunity in war, with many pacifists arguing that war\nis wrong because it puts the innocent at risk. Some opponents of the\ndeath penalty will make a similar argument about the death penalty and\nthe risk of executing the innocent. And opponents of abortion will\nalso claim that it harms the innocent. The connection between war, the\ndeath penalty, and abortion is made in the Catholic \u201cseamless\ngarment\u201d approach to the problem of developing a\n\u201cconsistent ethic of life.\u201d This approach condemns all\nactions that harm innocent persons; and it is often extended toward a\nrejection of all harm, without regard for the distinction between\ninnocence and guilt. Such a view has been defended most famously by\nPope John Paul II, who rejected (or was skeptical toward) all sorts of\nviolence including war, the death penalty, suicide, euthanasia, and\nabortion. Pacifists may also extend moral concern to include concern\nfor all sentient beings; and thus pacifists may also condemn\nmeat-eating and animal cruelty. Gandhi, for example, extended ahimsa\nmaximally to include avoiding harm to sentient beings.\n",
