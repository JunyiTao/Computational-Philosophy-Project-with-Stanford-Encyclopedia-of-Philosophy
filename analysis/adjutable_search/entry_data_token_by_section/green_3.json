    "main_text": "Idealist Metaphysics and Epistemology || Idealism\n2.2 Idealism\n\nGreen recognizes that there are obstacles to this idealist conclusion\nthat account for the plausibility of empiricist and Kantian dualisms\nbetween the world of appearances and things as they are independently\nof appearance. We seem to need nature, as distinct from appearances,\nin order to account for the source or causes of our appearances and to\naccount for fallibility\u2014the possibility of error\u2014which\nseems to be a precondition of objectivity (PE \u00a7\u00a713,\n69). By contrast, the idealist, who denies a reality independent of\nappearances, seems unable to explain the source of appearances and the\npossibility of fallibility. This, Green thinks, is what leads Kant,\nwho rightly insists on the relational character of experience\n(PE \u00a733), to distinguish between phenomena\u2014things\nas they do or can appear to us\u2014and noumena\u2014things as they\nare in themselves, independently of how they appear to us (PE\n\u00a7\u00a711, 21\u20132, 30, 34).\n\nBut, like Kant\u2019s idealist critic J.G. Fichte, Green thinks that\nthis Kantian dualism is an unstable resting point between empirical\nrealism and idealism. He believes that the consistent application of\nKantian principles should lead to the rejection of\nthings-in-themselves (PE\n \u00a741).[4]\n Kant\u2019s dualism is both unacceptable and unnecessary. It is\nunacceptable, because it leaves cognitive success a mystery.\n\n\nIt leaves us without an answer to the question, how the order of\nrelations, which the mind sets up, comes to reproduce those relations\nof the material world which are assumed to be of a wholly different\norigin and nature. (PE \u00a734)\n\n\nIndeed, Green thinks that the notion of things-in-themselves is empty,\nbecause we can have no conception of things of themselves.\n\nGreen also thinks the Kantian dualism is unnecessary. The idealist can\nexplain error. We can never have access to things-in-themselves. But\nwe can have access to other appearances that, in various ways, might\nrepresent a particular appearance as anomalous. Here, we check one\nappearance by appeal to others (PE \u00a7\u00a712\u201313,\n64). On this view, we can distinguish between individual appearances\nor clusters of experiences and reality but not between reality and the\nentire system of appearances entertained by a particular mind\n(PE \u00a713). We avoid answering the question how our\nconceptions of the world come to match a world that is independent of\nthem by identifying reality and objectivity with the way it is\nconceived holistically by a self-conscious mind (PE\n\u00a7\u00a710, 13, 36\u201337, 63).\n\nGreen says that reality and the system of appearances are equally\ndependent on each other (PE \u00a736) and warns against the\nmisunderstanding of idealism that results from thinking that it\nreduces facts to ideas (PE \u00a737). In the discussion of\nthe possibility of bare sensations, he does not deny that they would\nbe facts but insists that they would be facts that would not exist for\nconsciousness (PE \u00a7\u00a748\u20139). This suggests, not\nthe metaphysical claim that facts are mind-dependent, but the\nepistemic claim that only structured experience can be the\nbasis of knowledge. However, this epistemological claim is much less\nradical than the metaphysical claim. Nor is it clear how it is\ninconsistent with Kantian dualism; it appears to reaffirm Kant\u2019s\nclaim that we can only have knowledge of appearances and not to deny\nthat there are things-in themselves. Perhaps Green\u2019s claim is\nonly that we are unable to say anything about things-in-themselves,\neven to say of them that they exist, without bringing them in relation\nto a conscious subject (PE \u00a740).\n\nBut it\u2019s not even clear that Green can distinguish himself from\nKant in this way. For Green treats the subject of consciousness as\nnoumenon, outside of space and time (PE \u00a7\u00a751, 52,\n65). The subject of consciousness is a precondition of experience but\nis completely distinct from any element of experience (PE\n\u00a732). Because the self is not given in experience, it is, Green\nthinks, outside of space and time (PE \u00a7\u00a752, 65).\nThis dualism between elements of conscious experience that are in\nspace and time and the selves or epistemic agents who are\nself-conscious and are outside of space and time resembles\nKant\u2019s own dualism between appearances and\nthings-in-themselves.\n\nOne might question Green\u2019s dualism and anti-naturalism.\nParticular episodes of conscious experience presuppose a subject of\nconsciousness that is prior to and independent of those episodes of\nconsciousness. However, this does not imply that the self is prior to\nand independent of all experience. Perhaps the self is a set or series\nof experiences. Green may seem to rule out this possibility, because\nhe distinguishes between a succession of conscious states and\nconsciousness of a succession of such states and claims that\nself-consciousness requires the latter, and not just the former\n(PE \u00a7\u00a752, 55, 62\u201365). But if conscious states\ncan take other conscious states as their objects, it is not clear why\nthe self could not be a suitably diachronically ordered and\ninterrelated set of conscious experiences. In any case, the need for a\nself that is the bearer of discrete self-conscious experiences does\nnot preclude the self from being an object of consciousness, thought,\nor knowledge. Indeed, Green\u2019s entire theoretical and practical\nphilosophy turns crucially on the possibility of self-consciousness\nand its causal role in thought and action. As we will see, important\naspects of Green\u2019s views about moral responsibility presuppose\nthat the self is not outside space and time but rather plays a\nfundamental causal role in responsible action.\n",
