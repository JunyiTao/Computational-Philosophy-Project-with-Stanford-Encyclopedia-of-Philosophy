    "main_text": "The Critique of Logical Positivism\n2. The Critique of Logical Positivism\n\nHowever surprising it may initially seem, contemporary developments in\nthe philosophy of science can only be properly appreciated in relation\nto the historical background of logical positivism. Hempel himself\nattained a certain degree of prominence as a critic of this movement.\nLanguage, Truth and Logic (1936; 2nd edition,\n1946), authored by A.J. Ayer, offers a lucid exposition of the\nmovement, which was\u2014with certain variations\u2014based upon the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction, the observational/theoretical\ndistinction, and the verifiability criterion of meaningfulness. A\nfundamental desideratum motivating its members was to establish\nstandards for separating genuine questions for which answers might be\nfound from pseudo-questions for which no answers could be found.\n\nAccording to the first principle, sentences are analytic\nrelative to a language framework \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) when their truth\nfollows from its grammar and vocabulary alone. In English,\n\u201cBachelors are unmarried\u201d cannot be false, since\n\u201cbachelor \\(=_{\\df}\\) unmarried, adult male\u201d. Sentences of\nthis kind make no claims about the world, but instead reflect features\nof the linguistic framework as syntactical or semantic truths in\n\\(\\mathbf{L}\\). And sentences are synthetic when they make\nclaims about the world. Their truth in \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) does not follow\nfrom its grammar and vocabulary alone but hinges upon properties of\nthe world and its history. According to logical positivism, all such\nclaims about the world have to be evaluated on the basis of\nexperience, which means the kind of knowledge they display is a\nposteriori. But kinds of knowledge whose truth can be established\nindependently of experience are a priori.\n\nLogical positivism affirmed that, given a language \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), all\na priori knowledge is analytic and all synthetic knowledge is\na posteriori, thus denying the existence of knowledge that is\nboth synthetic and a priori. Indeed, the denial of the\nexistence of synthetic a priori knowledge is commonly assumed\nto define the position known as \u201cEmpiricism\u201d, while the\naffirmation of its existence defines \u201cRationalism\u201d. Figure\n1 thus reflects the intersection of kinds of sentences and kinds of\nknowledge on the Empiricist approach:\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nA Priori Knowledge\nA Posteriori Knowledge \n\nSynthetic Sentences\nNo\nYes \n\nAnalytic Sentences\nYes\n?  \n\n\nFigure 1. The Empiricist Position\n\n\nThe category for sentences that are analytic and yet represent a\nposteriori knowledge deserves discussion. The empirical study of\nthe use of language within language-using communities by field\nlinguists involves establishing the grammar and the vocabulary\nemployed within each such community. Their empirical research yields\ntheories of the languages, \\(\\mathbf{L}\\), used in those communities\nand affords a basis for distinguishing between which sentences are\nanalytic-in-\\(\\mathbf{L}\\) and which are synthetic-in-\\(\\mathbf{L}\\).\nThe kind of knowledge they acquire about specific sentences based on\nempirical procedures thus assumes the form, \u201cSentence \\(S\\)\nis analytic-in-\\(\\mathbf{L}\\)\u201d, when that is\ntrue of sentence \\(S\\), which is a\nposteriori.\n\nOne of Hempel\u2019s early influential articles was a defense of\nlogicism, according to which mathematics\u2014with the notable\nexception of geometry, which he addressed separately\u2014can be\nreduced to logic (for Hempel, including set theory) as its foundation\n(Hempel 1945c). Mathematics thus becomes an exemplar of analytic a\npriori knowledge. Two subtheses should be distinguished: (i) that\nall mathematical concepts can be defined by means of basic\nlogical concepts; and (ii) that all mathematical theorems can\nbe deduced from basic logical truths. In order to distinguish logicism\nfrom formalism, however, the former maintains that there is one\nsystem of logic that is fundamental to all inquiries, where all\nmathematical terms are reducible to logical terms, and all\nmathematical axioms are derivable from logical ones, which formalism\ndenies (Rech 2004).\n\nThe tenability of logicism has been disputed on multiple grounds, the\nmost prominent of which is that the notion of membership\nfundamental to the theory of sets is not a logical notion but rather a\nsymbol that must be added to first-order logic to formalize what is\nproperly understood as a non-logical theory. Nor would\nphilosophers today accept the conception of the axioms of set theory\nas logical axioms, since there exist alternatives. So even if\nmathematics were reducible to set theory, these considerations\nundermine Hempel\u2019s claim that mathematics is thereby reducible\nto logic (cf. Benacerraf 1981 and Linsky & Zalta 2006, which\nprovides an extensive bibliography). Hempel\u2019s views about\ngeometry, in retrospect, thus appear to have been the better\nfounded.\n",
