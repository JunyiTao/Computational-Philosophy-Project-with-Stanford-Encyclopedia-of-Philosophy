What are the \"objects\"\nof which history consists? Are there social structures or systems that\nplay a role in history? Are there causes at work in the historical\nprocess? Or is history simply an concatenation of the actions and\nmental frameworks of myriad individuals, high and low? If both\nstructures and actors are crucial to understanding history, what is\nthe relationship between them?\n\nMarc Bloch (1953) provided a very simple and penetrating definition of\nhistory. History is \"man in time\". By this he meant that history is\nthe product of human action, creativity, invention, conflict, and\ninteraction. Bloch was skeptical about many other categories commonly\nused to analyze history\u2014periods, epochs, civilizations, reigns,\nand centuries. Instead, he advocated for what can be called an\n\"actor-centered\" conception of history. If there are structures and\nsystems in history, they depend upon the beliefs, attitudes, and\nactions of individual actors. If there are causes in history, they\nlikewise depend upon the actions and interactions of human actors\nwithin a setting of humanly created institutions and norms. The task\nof the historian is to reconstruct the meanings, beliefs, values,\npurposes, constraints, and actions that jointly explain the moments of\nhistory, from the meaning of an ancient stele to the causes of the\nrapid defeat of France in 1940.\n\nThis perspective does not diminish the ontological importance of\nstructures, systems, and ideologies in history. It simply forces the\nhistorian, like the social scientist, to be attentive to the problem\nof articulating the relationship that exists between actors and\nstructures. A system of norms, a property system, and a moral ideology\nof feudal loyalty can all be understood as being both objectively\npresent at a time and place, and being ontologically dependent upon\nthe mental frameworks, actions, and relationships of the individual\nactors who make up these systems. This problem has been thoroughly\ndiscussed in the philosophy of social science under the rubric of\n\"ontological individualism\" (Zahle and Collin, 2014). Higher-level\nsocial entities are indeed causally powerful in the social world; and\nthey depend entirely for their causal powers on the characteristics of\nthe individual actors who constitute them. This is the requirement of\nmicrofoundations: extended social structures and causes depend upon\nmicrofoundations at the level of the individuals who constitute them\n(Little 2017). In particular, we need to have some idea about how\nindividuals have been brought to think and act in the ways required by\nthe structures and ideologies in which they function as adults. On\nthis approach, history is the result of the actions and thoughts of\nvast numbers of actors, and institutions, structures, and norms are\nlikewise embodied in the actions and mental frameworks of historically\nsituated individuals. Such an approach helps to inoculate us against\nthe error of reification of historical structures, periods, or forces,\nin favor of a more disaggregated conception of multiple actors and\nshifting conditions of action. This is the conception to which we are\ndrawn when we understand history along the lines proposed by\nBloch.\n\nThis orientation brings along with it the importance of analyzing\nclosely the social and natural environment in which actors frame their\nchoices. A historian\u2019s account of the flow of human action\neventuating in historical change unavoidably needs to take into\naccount the institutional and situational environment in which these\nactions take place. Part of the social environment of a period of\nhistorical change is the ensemble of institutions that exist more or\nless stably in the period: property relations, political institutions,\nfamily structures, educational practices, religious and moral values.\nSo historical explanations need to be sophisticated in their treatment\nof institutions, cultures, and practices. It is an important fact that\na given period in time possesses a fund of scientific and technical\nknowledge, a set of social relationships of power, and a level of\nmaterial productivity. It is also an important fact that knowledge is\nlimited; that coercion exists; and that resources for action are\nlimited. Within these opportunities and limitations, individuals, from\nleaders to ordinary people, make out their lives and ambitions through\naction.\n\nSimilar microfoundational accounts must be given in support of the\nidea of \"causes in history\". Once established, it is reasonably\nstraightforward to see how a social structure such as a property\nsystem or an ideology \"causes\" a historical outcome: by constraining\nthe choices of actors and contributing to their motivations and values\nin the choices they make, a structure or an ideology influences\nhistorically important events like social movements, market crashes,\nor outbreaks of ethnic violence. Structures influence individual\nactors, and individual actors collectively constitute structures. This\napproach gives a basis for judging that such-and-so circumstance\n\u201ccaused\u201d a given historical change; but it also provides\nan understanding of the way in which this kind of historical cause is\nembodied and conveyed\u2014through the actions and thoughts of\nindividuals in response to given natural and social circumstances.\n\nAre there large scale causes at work in historical processes?\nHistorians often pose questions like these: \u201cWhat were some of\nthe causes of the fall of Rome?\u201d, \u201cwhat were the causes of\nthe rise of fascism?\u201d, or \u201cwhat were the causes of the\nIndustrial Revolution?\u201d. These kinds of questions presuppose\nthat there were grand causes at work that had grand effects. However,\nit is more plausible to believe that the causes of some very large and\nsignificant historical events are themselves small, granular, gradual,\nand cumulative. If this is the case, then there is no satisfyingly\nsimple and high-level answer to the question, why did Rome fall?\nMoreover, astute historians like Bloch and his contemporaries\nrecognized that there is a very large amount of contingency and path\ndependency in historical change (Pierson, 2004). Historical outcomes\nare not determined by a few large scale causes; instead, multiple\nlocal, contingent, and conjunctural processes and happening jointly\ncome together in the production of the outcome of interest. It is\npossible, for example, that the collapse of the Roman Empire resulted\nfrom a myriad of very different contingencies and organizational\nfeatures in different parts of the empire. A contingent account of the\nfall of Rome might refer to logistical difficulties in supplying\narmies in the German winter, particularly stubborn local resistance in\nPalestine, administrative decay in Roman Britain, population pressure\nin Egypt, and a particularly inept series of commanders in Gaul.\nWithout drama, administrative and military collapse ensues. The best\nwe can do sometimes is to identify a swarm of independent, small-scale\nprocesses and contingencies that eventually produced the large outcome\nof interest.\n\nThis approach might be called \"actor-centered history\": we explain a\nhistorical moment or event when we have an account of what people\nthought and believed; what they wanted; and what social,\ninstitutional, and environmental conditions framed their choices. It\nis a view of history that gives close attention to states of\nknowledge, ideology, and agency, as well as institutions,\norganizations, and structures, and examines the actions and practices\nof individuals as they lived their lives within these constraining and\nenabling circumstances. Further, it emphasizes the contingency and\npath-dependency of history, and it acknowledges the fact of\nheterogeneity of institutions, beliefs, and actions across time and\nplace.\n",
