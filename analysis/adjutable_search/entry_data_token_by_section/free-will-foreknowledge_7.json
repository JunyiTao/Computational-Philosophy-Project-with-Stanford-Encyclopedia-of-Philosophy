    "main_text": "Compatibilist responses to theological fatalism || The necessity and the causal closure of the past\n2.7 The necessity and the causal closure of the past\n\nDoubts about premises (2) and (5) can be combined into a more radical\ncritique of the argument. We have already discussed the Ockhamist\nresponse, which accepts (2) as applied to what is strictly past, but\nrejects it as applied to that part of the past that is not wholly or\nstrictly past. It is worth asking, however, whether there is any such\nthing as the necessity of the past at all. What do we mean when we say\nthat the past, the strict past, is necessary? When people\nsay, \u201cThere is no use crying over spilled milk,\u201d they\npresumably mean that there is nothing anybody can do now about the\nspilled milk; the spilling of the milk is outside the realm of our\ncausal control. But it is not at all clear that pastness per\nse puts something outside the realm of our causal control.\nRather, it is pastness in conjunction with the metaphysical law that\ncauses must precede their effects. If we decided that effects can\nprecede their causes, it\u2019s quite possible that we would no\nlonger speak of the necessity of the past.\n\nSo the necessity of the past may simply be the principle that past\nevents are outside the class of causable events. There is a temporal\nasymmetry in causability because everything causable is in the future.\nBut some of the future is non-causable as well. Whether or not\ndeterminism is true, there are some events in the future that are\ncausally necessary. If a future event E is necessary, it is\ncausable, and not E is not causable. But if the necessity of\nthe past is the non-causability of the past, it would be odd to pick\nout the class of propositions about the past as possessing an\nallegedly distinct kind of necessity since some of the future has that\nsame kind of necessity.\n\nThis leads to a deeper problem in the idea of the necessity of the\npast. Zagzebski (2014) argues that the interpretation of the necessity\nof the past as a purely temporal modality is confused. What people\ngenerally mean by the necessity of the past is that the past is\ncausally closed, meaning the past is neither causable nor preventable.\nUnderstood that way, the necessity of the past is not a purely\ntemporal modality, and it is not a form of necessity. The categories\nof causability and non-causability do not correspond to the standard\nmodal categories of the necessary, possible, and impossible. The\nattempt to assimilate the causal categories to modal categories is a\nmistake.\n\nLet us see what happens to the argument for theological fatalism if\nthe necessity of the past is understood as the causal closure of the\npast.\n\nLet us begin with a definition of causal closure:\n\nE is causally closed =df There is nothing now that\ncan cause E, and there is nothing now that can cause not\nE.\n\nTo use this principle in an argument for fatalism, the principle of\nthe necessity of the past will need to be replaced with the following\nprinciple:\n\nPrinciple of the Causal Closure of the Past:\n\nIf E is an event in the past, E is causally\nclosed.\n\nWe will then need to replace the transfer of necessity principle by\nthe following:\n\nTransfer of Causal Closure Principle:\n\nIf E occurs and is causally closed, and necessarily (if\nE occurs then F occurs), then F is causally\nclosed.\n\nTo recast the argument for theological fatalism, let us again consider\nthe proposition that you will answer the telephone tomorrow at 9am and\ncall it T:\n\n(1) Yesterday God\ninfallibly believed T. [Supposition of infallible\nforeknowledge]\n(2) If E is an\nevent in the past, E is causally closed (Principle of the\ncausal closure of the past). \n(3) God\u2019s\nbelieving T yesterday is now causally closed. [1, 2]\n\n(4) Necessarily, if\nyesterday God believed S will answer the telephone tomorrow\nat 9am, then S will answer the telephone tomorrow at 9am.\n[Definition of infallibility]\n(5) If E\noccurs and is causally closed, and necessarily (if E occurs\nthen F occurs), then F is causally closed. [Transfer\nof causal closure principle]\n(6) S\u2019s\nact of answering the telephone tomorrow at 9am is now causally closed.\nThere is nothing now that can cause S to answer the telephone\ntomorrow and there is nothing now that can cause S not to\nanswer the telephone tomorrow. [1, 4, 5]\n\n\nBut (6) denies that there are causes of the future. Certainly we\nbelieve that something now, whether agents or events, can cause future\nevents, and the fatalist does not deny that. What the fatalist denies\nis that we can cause something other than what we cause. So\nthe relevant half of the principle of the causal closure of the past\nis as follows:\n\nPrinciple of the Unpreventability of the Past:\n\nIf E is an event in the past, nothing now can cause not\nE.\n\nTo use this principle in a fatalist argument, we need the\nfollowing:\n\nTransfer of Unpreventability Principle:\n\nIf E occurs and it is not now causable that E does\nnot occur, and necessarily (if E occurs, then F\noccurs), then it is not now causable that F does not\noccur.\n\nThis principle is virtually identical to the transfer of\nunpreventability principle proposed by Hugh Rice (2005), and is\nsimilar to a strengthened form of the well-known principle Beta first\nproposed by Peter van Inwagen (1983).\n\nUsing this principle, we get the following argument for theological\nfatalism:\n\n(1) Suppose that\nyesterday God infallibly believed T. \n\n\nFrom the Principle of the unpreventability of the past we get:\n\n(2) There is nothing\nnow that can cause God not to have believed T\nyesterday.\n\n\nFrom the definition of divine infallibility we get:\n\n(3) Necessarily, if God\nbelieved yesterday that S will answer the telephone at 9am tomorrow,\nthen S will answer the telephone at 9am tomorrow.\n\n\nFrom 2, 3, and the transfer of unpreventability principle we get:\n\n(4) There is nothing\nnow that can cause S not to answer the telephone at 9am\ntomorrow.\n\n\nFrom a variation of the Principle of Alternate Possibilities, we\nget:\n\n(5) If nothing can\ncause S not to answer the telephone at 9am tomorrow, then\nS does not answer the telephone freely. \n\n\nFrom (4) and (5), we get:\n\n(6) S does not\nanswer the telephone freely.\n\n\nThis argument for theological fatalism is better than the standard\nargument if a purely temporal necessity is problematic. The second\npremise of the above argument is only the principle that the past is\nunpreventable, not a questionable premise that the past has a special\nkind of necessity distinct from the causal structure of the universe\nsimply in virtue of being past. But since the unpreventability of the\npast is not a form of necessity in the formal sense, then the transfer\nprinciple licensing the crucial inference to (4) is not a transfer of\nnecessity. Unlike the transfer of temporal necessity principle in our\noriginal argument, it is not a variation of an axiom of logic, and is\nfar from indisputable. This suggests that the idea of the necessity of\nthe past may be confused. On the one hand, we have inherited from\nOckham the idea that the past has a kind of necessity for which we can\nformulate an analogue of the formal principles of logical necessity.\nBut the intuitions supporting such a form of necessity are largely\nintuitions about causability, and the modalities of\ncausability/non-causability do not parallel necessity, possibility,\nand impossibility. If this is correct, then if there is a true\ntransfer of causability or non-causability principle, it is not\nbecause it is like logical necessity in its formal structure. The\nproblem, then, is that the fatalist argument needs a kind of necessity\nthat the past has and which is also transferred to the future via a\nvalid transfer of necessity principle. In section\n 5\n we will look at how this is a general problem that extends beyond the\nissue of fatalism.\n2.8 The rejection of the Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)\n\nCompatibilists who hold that it\u2019s possible for an agent to do\notherwise, in the sense required for free will, even if her action is\ncausally determined, will probably be untroubled by an argument\npurporting to show that no one can do otherwise, given divine\nforeknowledge. The relevant interlocutors for the argument for\ntheological fatalism are those who endorse a libertarian conception of\nfree will (Alston 1985).\n\nWith that in mind, let us now look at premise (9). This is a form of\nthe Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP), a principle that has\nbecome well-known in the literature on free will ever since it was\nattacked by Harry Frankfurt (1969) in some interesting thought\nexperiments. The point of Frankfurt\u2019s paper was to drive a wedge\nbetween responsibility and alternate possibilities, and to thereby\ndrive a wedge between responsibility and libertarian freedom. In\ngeneral, those defending libertarian freedom also defend PAP, and\nthose attacking PAP, like Frankfurt, defend determinism, but some\nphilosophers have argued that PAP is false even if we have libertarian\nfree will. The literature that clearly distinguishes the claim that\nfree will requires alternate possibilities from the claim that free\nwill requires the falsehood of determinism is contemporary. The former\nis a thesis about events in counterfactual circumstances, whereas the\nlatter is a thesis about the locus of causal control in the actual\ncircumstances. Aside from the foreknowledge literature, support for\nthe rejection of PAP from the perspective of an incompatibilist about\nfree will and determinism can be found in Stump (1990, 1996), Hunt\n(1999b), Zagzebski (1991, 2000), Pereboom (2000), and Shabo (2010).\nThis view was originally called hyper-incompatibilism by John Martin\nFischer, but has recently been called source incompatibilism. For a\nrecent critique of this version of incompatibilism for solving the\nforeknowledge problem, see Werther (2005) and Talsma (2013).\n\nHere is an example of a typical Frankfurt case intended to show that\nan agent can act freely even when she lacks alternate\npossibilities:\n\nBlack, an evil neurosurgeon, wishes to see Smith dead but is\nunwilling to do the deed himself. Knowing that Mary Jones also\ndespises Smith and will have a single good opportunity to kill him,\nBlack inserts a mechanism into Jones\u2019s brain that enables Black\nto monitor and to control Jones\u2019s neurological activity. If the\nactivity in Jones\u2019s brain suggests that she is on the verge of\ndeciding not to kill Smith when the opportunity arises, Black\u2019s\nmechanism will intervene and cause Jones to decide to commit the\nmurder. On the other hand, if Jones decides to murder Smith on her\nown, the mechanism will not intervene. It will merely monitor but will\nnot affect her neurological function. Now suppose that when the\noccasion arises, Jones decides to kill Smith without any\n\u201chelp\u201d from Black\u2019s mechanism. In the judgment of\nFrankfurt and most others, Jones is morally responsible for her act.\nNonetheless, it appears that she is unable to do otherwise since if\nshe had attempted to do so, she would have been thwarted by\nBlack\u2019s device.\n\nMost commentators on examples like this agree that the agent is both\nmorally responsible for her act and acts freely in whatever sense of\nfreedom they endorse. They differ on whether she can do otherwise at\nthe time of her act. Determinists generally interpret the case as one\nin which she exercises compatibilist free will and has no alternate\npossibilities. Most libertarians interpret it as one in which she\nexercises libertarian free will and has alternate possibilities,\ncontrary to appearances. As mentioned above, some philosophers have\ninterpreted it as a case in which she exercises libertarian free will\nbut does not have alternate possibilities. If Frankfurt cases can be\nsuccessfully interpreted in this third way, then they can be used to\nshow the compatibility of infallible foreknowledge and libertarian\nfreedom. Hunt (1999a) argues that this is essentially the solution put\nforward by Augustine in On Free Choice of the Will\nIII.1\u20134, though Augustine\u2019s own considered position on\nfree will was not libertarian.\n\nBut there is another way Frankfurt cases can be used to argue for the\ncompatibility of foreknowledge and freedom. There is an important\ndisanalogy between a Frankfurt case and infallible foreknowledge that\nmight lead one to doubt whether an agent really lacks alternate\npossibilities when her act is infallibly foreknown. A crucial\ncomponent of the standard Frankfurt case is that the agent is\nprevented from acting freely in close possible worlds. That aspect of\nthe case is not in dispute. Black\u2019s device is counterfactually\nmanipulative even if it is not actually manipulative. In contrast,\ninfallible foreknowledge is not even counterfactually manipulative.\nThere is no close possible world in which foreknowledge prevents the\nagent from acting freely. Of course, if theological fatalism is true,\nnobody ever acts freely, but the point is that there is no\nmanipulation going on in other possible worlds in the foreknowledge\nscenario. The relation between foreknowledge and human acts is no\ndifferent in one world than in any other. But it is precisely the fact\nthat the relation between the Frankfurt machine and Mary\u2019s act\ndiffers in the actual world from what it is in other close worlds that\nis supposed to make the Frankfurt example work in showing the falsity\nof PAP.\n\nTo make this point clear, let us look at how the standard Frankfurt\ncase would have to be amended to make it a close analogy to the\nsituation of infallible foreknowledge. As Zagzebski has argued (1991,\nchap. 6, sec. 2.1), the device implanted in Mary\u2019s brain would\nhave to be set in such a way that no matter what Mary did, it never\nintervened. It is not even true that it might have\nintervened. Any world in which Mary decides to commit the murder is a\nworld in which the device is set to make her commit the murder should\nshe not decide to do it, and any world in which she does not decide to\ncommit the murder is a world in which the device is set to prevent her\nfrom deciding to do it if she is about to decide to do it. Now of\ncourse this might be an impossible device, but it would have to be as\ndescribed to be a close analogy to the foreknowledge scenario. And our\nreactions to this amended Frankfurt case are very different from\ntypical reactions to the standard Frankfurt case. In the standard case\nit at least appears to be true that the agent cannot do otherwise,\nwhereas in the case amended to be parallel to the foreknowledge case\nthere is a very straightforward sense in which the agent can do\notherwise because her will is not thwarted by Black in any reasonably\nclose possible world. The machine is ready to manipulate her, but it\ndoes not manipulate her, nor might it have manipulated her since it\ndoes not even manipulate her in counterfactual circumstances. We might\nthink of the machine as a metaphysical accident\u2014an extraneous\naddition to the story that plays no part in the sequence of events in\nany possible world. Possibly it is not clear in the amended story\nwhether or not Mary has alternate possibilities. What the story shows,\nthen, is that alternate possibilities are not always relevant to the\npossession of libertarian freedom.\n\nDisanalogies between the cases are relevant, however, only if the\nprospects for exempting divine foreknowledge from PAP depend on how\nclosely it mimics Frankfurt-type counterexamples. That assumption may\nbe unwarranted. Augustine\u2019s counterexample to PAP was divine\nforeknowledge itself, not a proto-Frankfurtian thought experiment\nfeaturing a counterfactual intervener. Since God infallibly believed\nyesterday that you will answer the phone at 9:00 am tomorrow, there is\nno alternative possibility on which you fail to answer the phone at\n9:00 tomorrow morning; but since \u201ca man does not therefore sin\nbecause God foreknew that he would sin\u201d (CG\nV.10) and, more generally, \u201cGod\u2019s foreknowledge does not\nforce the future to happen\u201d (FCW III.4), we can still\nregard your action as free, even in the libertarian sense. So PAP is\nfalse, for the same reasons Frankfurt pronounced it false in his story\nabout Black, Smith and Jones: God\u2019s foreknowledge, no less than\nBlack\u2019s mechanism, played no role at all in leading the agent to\nperform the action, could have been subtracted from the situation\nwithout making any difference to what happened or why it happened, and\nis completely irrelevant to understanding why the agent acted as she\ndid (Frankfurt 1969, 836\u20137). Divine foreknowledge constitutes\nits own counterexample to PAP (Hunt 2003).\n\nIf this is correct, the following dilemma critique of theological\nfatalism becomes available (Hunt 2017a). Either the argument fails\nsomewhere along the way to (8), or it succeeds up through (8). If it\nfails at one of these earlier steps, it fails full stop. That\u2019s\nthe obvious horn of the dilemma. But if it reaches step (8)\nsuccessfully, and reaches it for those reasons, we have a\ncase in which you cannot do otherwise than answer the phone tomorrow\nmorning, but you are presumptively free in doing so, since you are\nacting on your own, and the circumstances that deprive you of\nalternatives do not in any way explain your action. So (9) is false,\nand it\u2019s falsified by (8). Whether (1)-(8) succeeds or fails,\nthen, the fatalistic inference to (10) is blocked.\n\nNote that this solution shares an intuition with the dependence\nresponse surveyed in 2.5, namely, that God\u2019s foreknowledge is\nexplanatorily dependent on future events, and not the other way\naround. The difference is that the Dependence Solution retains PAP by\ndenying the general necessity of the past, while the\nAugustinian/Frankfurtian approach is to abandon PAP and stick with the\nnecessity of the past.\n3. Incompatibilist responses to the argument for theological fatalism\n\nEver since the dilemma of this article was identified, there have been\nphilosophers who thought that something like our basic argument\nsucceeds in demonstrating that infallible foreknowledge is\nincompatible with human free will. If they are incompatible, one of\nthem must be given up. It\u2019s possible to give up both, of course,\nbut that\u2019s more than the argument requires, and one reason the\ndilemma has attracted so much attention in the history of philosophy\nis that both the belief in a being with infallible foreknowledge and\nbelief in the existence of libertarian free will are strongly\nentrenched in the world view of many philosophers. To give up either\nof these beliefs is difficult and often has many ramifications for\none\u2019s other beliefs.\n\nThe denial of libertarian freedom has always had many supporters. The\nidea of making causal determinism the focal point of discussions of\nfree will is modern in origin, and some philosophers think that the\nmodern framing of the issue is confused. Philosophers who deny\nlibertarian freedom may affirm a type of free will compatible with\ndeterminism, or they may instead simply accept the consequence that\nhuman beings lack free will. It is worth noting, however, that theists\nwho deny libertarian freedom are typically theological\ndeterminists rather than fatalists; it\u2019s\nprimarily considerations of divine omnipotence or sovereignty, rather\nthan foreknowledge, that motivate them. When Augustine, for example,\nrejected human freedom apart from divine control\u2014\u201cI tried\nhard to maintain the free decision of the human will, but the grace of\nGod was victorious\u201d (Retractationes 2.1)\u2014it\nwasn\u2019t because of the fatalist argument from divine\nforeknowedge, which (as we\u2019ve seen) he regarded as a complete\nfailure. Jonathan Edwards, on the other hand, based his Calvinist\ndenial of libertarian freedom, in part, on a sophisticated version of\nthe argument for theological fatalism (FW II.12).\n\nThe other incompatibilist position is to affirm libertarian free will\nalong with the principle of alternate possibilities (premise 9), and\nto deny the possibility of infallible foreknowledge. This position has\nrecently come into prominence through its association with \u201copen\ntheism\u201d (Pinnock et al. 1994). Open theists reject\ndivine timelessness and immutability, along with infallible\nforeknowledge, arguing that not only should foreknowledge be rejected\nbecause of its fatalist consequences, but the view of a God who takes\nrisks, and can be surprised and even disappointed at how things turn\nout, is more faithful to Scripture than the classical notion of an\nessentially omniscient and foreknowing deity (Sanders 1998, Boyd\net al 2001, 13\u201347). See Rhoda et al\n(2006) for an argument that the key issue in the open theism debate is\nthe nature of the future, and Tuggy (2007) for an overview of the\ndifferent positions open theists can take on this question. A reply to\nboth Rhoda et al. and Tuggy may be found in Craig and Hunt\n(2013). Fischer, Todd and Tognazzini (2009) offers a wide-ranging\nappraisal of responses to Pike's argument, paying special\nattention to open theism and issues in the philosophy of time. For an\nargument that open theism necessitates the view that propositions\nabout the future lack truth value, see Arbour (2013). Todd disagrees\non behalf of the open theist, defending (but without endorsing) the\nmutability of the future (2016a), and arguing that future contingents\nare all false rather than truth-valueless (2016b). Boyd (2015)\nattempts to turn the tables against critics on the grounds that the\nopenist God\u2019s knowledge of all the ways the future\nmight go represents more knowledge than the\nclassical theistic God\u2019s knowledge of the way the future\nwill go. Arbour (2019) is a recent collection of commisioned\nessays criticizing open theism on philosophical grounds.\n\nOne influential argument that open theists use against defenders of\nforeknowledge who do not also accept Molinism is that foreknowledge\nwithout middle knowledge is useless for divine providence. In a number\nof papers (1993, 1997, 2009), David Hunt has defended the providential\nutility of foreknowledge without middle knowledge, describing cases in\nwhich foreknowledge enhances God\u2019s providential prospects\nwithout generating the \u201cmetaphysical problem\u201d of\nexplanatory circles, and arguing that the \u201cdoxastic\nproblem\u201d of agential impotence when one already knows what one\nis going to do rests on a principle that is in fact false. Responses\nto Hunt include Kapitan (1993), Basinger (1993), Robinson (2004a,\n2004b), and Hasker (2009). Zimmerman (2012) is friendlier to\nHunt\u2019s position.\n\nA related objection to foreknowledge without middle knowledge is that\nprophecy requires middle knowledge. See Pruss (2007) for a defense of\na foreknowledge-only account of prophecy. Another issue related to\ndivine providence is the efficacy of past-directed prayers. Kevin\nTimpe (2005) argues that adherents of simple foreknowledge or timeless\nknowledge and Molinists have the resources to explain the efficacy of\nprayers about the past, but open theism does not.\n4. Logical fatalism\n\nA form of fatalism that is even older than theological fatalism is\nlogical fatalism, the thesis that the past truth of a proposition\nabout the future entails fatalism. Aristotle discusses this form of\nfatalism in his famous Sea Battle Argument, mentioned in section\n 2.1\n above. A clearer and more sophisticated form of the argument was\nproposed by Diodorus Cronus, whose argument is remarkably similar in\nform to our basic argument for theological fatalism. The logical\nfatalist argument parallels our basic argument as follows:\nArgument for logical fatalism\nLet S = the proposition that there will be a sea battle\ntomorrow.\n\n(1L) Yesterday it was\ntrue that S. [assumption]\n(2L) If some\nproposition was true in the past, it is now-necessary that it was true\nthen. [Form of the Necessity of the Past]\n(3L) It is\nnow-necessary that yesterday it was true that S. [1,\n2]\n(4L) Necessarily, if\nyesterday it was true that S, then now it is true that\nS. [omnitemporality of truth]\n(5L) If it is\nnow-necessary that p and if necessarily (p then\nq), then it is now-necessary that q. [Transfer of Necessity\nPrinciple]\n(6L) Therefore, it is\nnow-necessary that now it is true that S. [3L, 4L,\n5L]\n(7L) If it is\nnow-necessary that now it is true that S, no alternative to\nthe truth of S is now-possible. [definition of\n\u201cnecessary\u201d]\n(8L) So no alternative\nto the truth of S is now-possible [6L, 7L] \n(9L) If no alternative\nto the truth of a proposition about the future is now-possible, then\nwhat the proposition is about will not be brought about by free human\nchoice. [Version of Principle of Alternate Possibilities]\n(10L) Hence, the sea\nbattle tomorrow will not be brought about by free human choice. [8L,\n9L]\n\n\nUnlike the argument for theological fatalism, the argument for logical\nfatalism has few defenders. One reason is that (2L) is less plausible\nthan (2). (3L) is a soft fact about the past, if anything is.\nNevertheless, some philosophers, like Susan Haack (1974) and William\nLane Craig (1987), have maintained that theological fatalism is just a\ngussied up version of logical fatalism, and that the former is no more\nimpressive than the latter once one looks past the theological\nwindow-dressing. This seems to be Merricks\u2019 (2009) position as\nwell, since he holds that theological fatalism fails for essentially\nthe same reason as logical fatalism. Warfield (1997) has argued for\nthe equivalence of the two forms of fatalism if God is necessarily\nexistent and essentially omniscient. Responses have been given by\nHasker (1998) and Brueckner (2000), and Warfield (2000) offers a\nrejoinder to both. Hunt (2002) links Warfield\u2019s argument with\nPlantinga\u2019s (1986), discussed in\n 2.4,\n inasmuch as both exploit the logical equivalence of propositions\nabout the contingent future with God\u2019s believing those\npropositions, and argues that they both fall prey to the same\nreductio: the closure principles they invoke (closure of consistency\nunder logical equivalence for Warfield, closure of hard/soft facthood\nunder logical equivalence for Plantinga) would equally support the\ncompatibility of free will with divine determinism, an unacceptable\nresult for a libertarian. Peter Graham (2008) argues that the\nconsensus about consistency to which Warfield appeals emerged against\nthe backdrop of an assumption that there is no necessarily existent\nbeing, and is therefore question-begging.\n5. Beyond theological fatalism\n\nThere\u2019s more at stake here than the coherence of libertarian\ntheism, as evidenced by the many non-libertarians and non-theists who\nhave contributed to the debate. A comparison might be helpful.\nThere\u2019s more at stake in Zeno\u2019s Achilles paradox than the\nfleetness of Achilles and the torpidity of tortoises. If that\u2019s\nall there was to it, the discovery that Achilles was actually a\nquadraplegic, or that the tortoises of ancient Greece were as fast as\njack rabbits, would resolve the puzzle. But that would simply exempt\nAchilles and/or the tortoise from complicity in the problem; it would\ndo nothing to address the real issues presented by Zeno\u2019s\nargument. The situation is arguably the same when it comes to the\nargument for theological fatalism (Hunt 2017a). If the argument\ngets God wrong by assuming that he\u2019s in time when he\nisn\u2019t, the problem possibly goes away for God, once the mistake\nis corrected, but it\u2019s easily reinstated by replacing God with\nGud, an infallibly omniscient being who exists in time. If the\nargument gets human beings wrong by assuming that they have\n(libertarian) free will when they don\u2019t, the problem can be\nreformulated in terms of Gud\u2019s infallible beliefs about the\nfuture actions of Eleutherians, a race of extraterrestrials stipulated\nto possess libertarian freedom. This is to understand the argument for\ntheological fatalism as a thought experiment. Whether or not divine\nforeknowledge and libertarian freedom are real, we\u2019re being\nasked, what if? Could libertarian freedom really be incompatible with\ndivine foreknowledge for the reasons given in the argument?\nThe answer to this question may involve rethinking more than God and\nfree will.\n\nZagzebski has argued that the dilemma of theological fatalism is\nbroader than a problem about free will. The modal or causal asymmetry\nof time, a transfer of necessity principle, and the supposition of\ninfallible foreknowledge are mutually inconsistent. (1991, appendix).\nIf there is a distinct kind of necessity that the past has\nqua past, and which is not an implicit reference to the lack\nof causability of the past, then it is temporally asymmetrical. The\npast has it and the future does not. The necessity of the past and the\ncontingency of the future are two sides of the same coin. To say that\nthe future is contingent in the sense of temporal modality does not\nimply that we have causal control over the entire future, of course.\nWe lack control over part of the future because part (or even all) of\nit is causally necessary. But if the necessity of the past is distinct\nfrom the lack of causability, and is a type of necessity the past has\njust because it is past, the future must lack that particular kind of\nnecessity.\n\nThe idea that there is temporally asymmetrical modality is\ninconsistent with the transfer of necessity principle and the\nsupposition of infallible foreknowledge of an essentially omniscient\ndeity. The inconsistency can be demonstrated as follows:\n\nDilemma of Foreknowledge and Modal Temporal Asymmetry\n\nAgain, let T = the proposition that you will answer the\ntelephone tomorrow at 9 am.\n\n(1f) There is (and was\nbefore now) an essentially omniscient foreknower (EOF) [Assumption for\ndilemma]\n\n\n(1f) and the Principle of the Necessity of the Past tells us that\n\n(2f) Either it is\nnow-necessary that the EOF believed T before now or it is\nnow-necessary that the EOF believed not T before now.\n\n\n\nFrom (1f) and the definition of an EOF it follows that\n\n(3f) Necessarily (The\nEOF believed before now that T \u2192 T), and\nnecessarily (The EOF believed before now that not T \u2192\nnot T). \n\n\nBy the Transfer of Necessity Principle (TNP), (2f) and (3f) entail\n\n(4f) Either it is\nnow-necessary that T or it is now-necessary that not\nT.\n\n\n(4f) is logically equivalent to\n\n(5f) Either it is not\nnow-possible that T or it is not now-possible that not\nT.\n\n\nFrom the Principle of the Contingency of the Future we get\n\n(6f) It is now-possible\nthat T and it is now-possible that not\nT.\n\n\nBut (6f) contradicts (5f).\n\nThe inconsistency shown in this argument has nothing to do with free\nwill or fatalism. In fact, the problem is even more general than this\nargument illustrates. The reason essential omniscience conflicts with\ntemporal modality and the transfer principle is that the existence of\nan EOF requires that a proposition about the past entails a\nproposition about the future. But it straightforwardly follows from\nTNP that a proposition that is now-necessary cannot entail a\nproposition that is not now-necessary. So if the past is now-necessary\nand the future is not, a proposition about the past cannot entail a\nproposition about the future. The conclusion is that if asymmetrical\ntemporal modality is coherent, it can obey TNP, or it can permit a\nproposition about the past to entail a proposition about the future,\nbut not both.\n\nThe root of the problem, then, is that it is impossible for there to\nbe a type of modality that has the following features:\n\n(a) The past and future\nare asymmetrical in that the past qua past is necessary with respect\nto this type of modality, whereas the future qua future is contingent\nwith respect to this type of modality.\n(b) There are\npropositions about the past that entail propositions about the future.\n\n(c) TNP\nobtains.\n\n\nSo the problem of the alleged incompatibility of infallible\nforeknowledge and free will is a special case of a more general\nproblem about time and necessity. It was suggested in section\n 2.6\n that the problem may be (a) above. There is no temporally\nasymmetrical necessity. But regardless of what one thinks of fatalist\narguments, the general problem in the logic of time and causation\nneeds to be addressed. Both the alleged modal asymmetry of time and\nthe causal asymmetry should be examined in more detail.\n\nThe problem of foreknowledge and fatalism has been around for a long\ntime, but the amount of philosophical attention it has attracted since\n1965 is truly remarkable. The literature on this problem is enormous,\nand it continues to grow. ",
