    "main_text": "First Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: One Historically Associated with a Non-Feminist Environmental Philosophy || Western Environmental Philosophy\n2.1 Western Environmental Philosophy\nThe historical beginnings of Western environmental philosophy are\nin environmental ethics. Unlike canonical Western ethics, Western\nenvironmental ethics (both feminist and non-feminist) is\npredicated on the claim that humans have moral responsibilities (or\nobligations) to nonhuman animals and/or nature, although they disagree\nabout the basis of these responsibilities. Some argue that the basis\nis the intrinsic (or inherent) value of nonhuman animals and/or\nnature, in contrast with the canonical view that they have merely\ninstrumental (or extrinsic) value. Some argue that there are\nproperties that nonhuman animals and/or nature have (such as,\nsentiency, rights, or interests) by virtue of which they deserve moral\nconsideration in their own right (or, have moral standing). Despite\ndisagreements about the basis of these human responsibilities, Western\nenvironmental philosophy asserts what canonical philosophy\ndenies\u2014 that humans have moral responsibilities to nonhuman\nanimals and/or nature themselves, and not just to humans where\nnonhuman animals and/or nature are concerned. As a kind of Western\nenvironmental philosophy, feminist environmental philosophy supports\nthe claim that canonical Western philosophy does not generate\na bona fide environmental philosophy, since it fails to\nrecognize that humans have moral obligations (or responsibilities) to\nnonhuman animals and/or nature themselves. (Throughout the remainder\nof the essay, any reference to philosophy, environmental philosophy or\nfeminist environmental philosophy is to Western philosophy.)\n",
