    "main_text": "Explanatory Roles for Attention || Attention and Demonstrative Reference\n3.2 Attention and Demonstrative Reference\n\nConsciousness is only one of the philosophically puzzling mental\nphenomena that have been thought to be related to attention in ways\nthat may prove to be explanatorily revealing. Demonstrative\nreference is another. One advocate of the idea that attention\ncontributes to the explanation of demonstrative reference is John\nCampbell, who writes that:\n\n\u2026 the notion of conscious attention to an object has an\nexplanatory role to play: it has to explain how it is that we have\nknowledge of the reference of a demonstrative. (2002, 45)\n\n\nA similar idea was explored in the manuscript on Theory of Knowledge\nthat Bertrand Russell abandoned (under the influence of Wittgenstein)\nin the summer in 1913. In that work Russell gives the following\nstatement of the idea that reference to particulars requires attention\nto them:\n\nAt any moment of my conscious life, there is one object (or at most\nsome very small number of objects) to which I am attending. All\nknowledge of particulars radiates out from this object. (1913, 40)\n\n\nIn support of the Russellian claim that there is an explanatory\nrelation between attention and demonstrative reference, Campbell\ndevelops two lines of thought.\n\nHis first line of thought comes from reflection on examples concerning\nthe requirements that have to be met in order to understand\ndemonstrative expressions in conversational contexts where one of the\nparticipants in the conversation uses expressions such as \u2018that\nwoman\u2019, but where various women are present, all of whom are\npossible referents for this demonstrative. Knowing which women is\nmeant, according to Campbell, requires attending to the woman in\nquestion and knowing that it is to her that the speaker was attending.\nThis is intended to show more than just that the direction of the\nspeaker\u2019s attention is a possible source of evidence for what\nthat speaker means. It is intended as showing that attention and\nreference stand in a particularly intimate relationship\u2014a\nrelationship that Campbell characterizes by saying that\n\u2018knowledge of the reference of a demonstrative is provided by\nconscious attention to the object\u2019 (p. 22).\n\nThe second line of thought that Campbell develops in support of the\nview that attention explains demonstrative reference is one pertaining\nto deductive arguments in which the premises refer to items that are\npicked out by demonstratives: Arguments such as \u2018(1) That is F.\n(2) That is G. Therefore (3) That is F and G\u2019. Campbell\u2019s\nthought here is that such arguments depend for their validity on there\nbeing no possibility of equivocating on the meaning of\n\u2018that\u2019, as it occurs in the two separate premises. Such\narguments can only figure in rationally-entitling reasoning so long as\nthere is a single fixing of the referent of \u2018that\u2019 in both\npremises. This reference fixing, Campbell thinks, is achieved if and\nonly if there is no redirection of attention between the premises.\nAgain this is intended to show more than just that there is some\ncausal or evidential relation between attending and referring. It is\nintended to show that the role played by attention in fixing the\nreference of a demonstrative is analogous to the role played by a\nFregean Sense in fixing the reference of a proper name (Campbell,\n2002, Chapter 5).\n\nThe explanatory approach that Campbell advocates, and that Russell\nconsidered, has traditionally been thought to suffer from a problem of\ncircularity. This problem was urged by Peter Geach in Mental\nActs (1957). Geach considers the suggestion that we can use\nattention to explain our ability to make reference to the things that\nwe perceive, but thinks that no such suggestion can provide a genuine\nexplanation of reference because:\n\n\u2026 it is quite useless to say the relevant sense-perceptions\nmust be attended to, either this does not give a sufficient condition,\nor else \u201cattended to\u201d is a mere word for the very relation\nof judgment to sense perception that requires analysis. (1957, 64)\n\n\nGeach\u2019s threat of circularity can be avoided if an independently\ngiven theory of how attention is constituted can be shown to\nilluminate the way in which reference is fixed by it. Imogen Dickie\nhas attempted to show just this. In a 2011 paper Dickie shows that\ncognitive psychology provides us with a theory of the role played by\nattention in tracking objects over time. She suggests that such a\ntheory can be used to account for the way in which attending to an\nobject removes any knowledge-defeating component of luck from our\ninferences involving it, thereby establishing the attended object as a\npossible topic of demonstrative thoughts (Dickie, 2011, 2015). This\ntreatment of attention exemplifies some of the central themes in\nDickie\u2019s more general attempt to explain how thoughts come to be\nabout ordinary objects (and so how singular terms come to refer to\nthose objects). The explanation that she offers is one in which a\nthought comes to be about a thing when the justificatory practices in\nwhich that thought figures are anchored to the object in question (in\na sense of \u2018anchoring\u2019 that Dickie spells out in detail\n(Dickie, 2015)).\n\nWhether or not a theory of attention can be turned into a non-circular\nexplanation of demonstrative reference, the idea that attention and\nreference are related does seem to cast light on what goes on when we\nunderstand referring expressions. Campbell\u2019s examples succeed in\nsuggesting that what we attend to and what we refer to are often the\nsame. There is also some empirical evidence, coming from developmental\npsychology, indicating that attention-related abilities play a crucial\nrole in the infant\u2019s development of an understanding of its\ncaregiver\u2019s demonstrative use (see\n Section 3.3).\n Lessons have been drawn from this that are not only about the\ncomprehension of linguistic expressions. This developmental work has\nalso been taken to imply something about our grasp on directly\nreferring thoughts. The idea here \u2013 as in the work of\nDickie and Campbell \u2013 is not only that attention contributes to\nour production and comprehension of linguistic expressions that have\nparticular referents, but that it also contributes to the\nestablishment of those referents as the contents of our thoughts. In\naddition to these developmental considerations, Michael Barkasi has\nsuggested that the nature of attention\u2019s contribution to fixing\nthe reference of thoughts can be illuminated by considering the\npattern of neural projections to the frontal eye fields. Whereas\nCampbell characterizes attention in epistemic terms, Barkasi\nfavours a sub-doxastic characterization, in which attention\n\u2018sets targets\u2019 and thereby regulates the flow of visual\ninformation (Barkasi, 2019).\n",
