    "main_text": "Foundational Feminist Perspectives || Epistemology\n2.2 Epistemology\n\nThe dominant form of epistemology within feminist bioethics is\nsimilarly social. The knowledge to which individuals have access is\ncollectively generated, maintained, circulated and conveyed, and the\nmoral subject of feminist bioethics therefore has epistemic resources\nthat differ markedly from those available to the traditional singular\nself. Moreover, gendered social identities have the effect of shaping\nthe epistemic resources that are available to the inhabitants of those\nidentities (Harding 1991; Wylie 2003). The situated epistemic\nresources of marginalized social identities will differ from those of\nmore powerful groups, and vice versa. Beyond an awareness of the\nsituated nature of knowledge, feminist standpoint epistemology\npresents the stronger claim that marginalized identities have a unique\nepistemic insight into the specific effects of power maldistribution\n(Hartsock 1983; Grasswick 2004; Harding 2009; Intemann 2010; see also\nSEP entries by Anderson on\n feminist epistemology\n and Grasswick on\n feminist social epistemology).\n\nSocial positioning also determines whether the knowledge a person has\nis considered credible by members of her own or other groups. Gendered\nor otherwise biased social and political structures generate skewed\ndistributions of epistemic authority, leading to a variety of forms of\nepistemic injustice\u2014an idea that has been developed in many\ntheoretical directions and widely disseminated through moral and\npolitical philosophy (Fricker 2007; Code 2014; Dotson 2014; Pohlhaus\n2017; Grasswick 2018). In summary, where traditional epistemology\nlooks at how individuals acquire and use information, from a feminist\nperspective the center of attention shifts to the social and political\nstructures within which knowledge is created and maintained, and\nepistemic injustice can occur. Epistemic injustice refers to the\nunfair ways in which the knowledge of individuals who belong to\nsocially marginalized and stigmatized groups is treated. The most\ncommonly described forms or families of epistemic injustice are\ntestimonial and hermeneutical. Testimonial injustice describes those\nsituations where a person\u2019s identity results in their statements\nbeing ignored or disbelieved: a relevant example would be the vaginal\nmesh scandal, in which women\u2019s claims of pain and injury were\ndisregarded (O\u2019Neill 2021). Hermeneutical injustice on the other\nhand occurs when a person\u2019s or group\u2019s knowledge is\nexcluded from the collective epistemic resources (the things\n\u201ceveryone knows\u201d) because their knowledge is dismissed as\nunimportant or irrelevant. An example here would be the overall lack\nof data about pregnant women\u2019s responses to common medication\nbecause of their historical exclusion from clinical research. This\nexclusion was justified on ethical grounds (the protection of the\nsupposedly vulnerable woman and foetus), but the ethical evaluation\nwas based on unjustified sexist assumptions.\n\nFeminist epistemology therefore drives a re-examination of how ethical\nissues are perceived and described, whose experiences are afforded\ncredibility, how (and by whom) an issue is defined as\n\u201cmoral\u201d in the first place, and how consensus on what\nconstitutes a robust ethical evaluation is shaped by the social\norganization of epistemic authority.\n",
