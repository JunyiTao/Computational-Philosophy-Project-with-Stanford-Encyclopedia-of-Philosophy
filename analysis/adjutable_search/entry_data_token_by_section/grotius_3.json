    "main_text": "Natural Law\n3. Natural Law\n\nNatural law is multiply ambiguous. It can be descriptive, in that it\nis sometimes supposed to describe a certain set of facts which obtain\nbecause of some natural features. At the same time, it can also be\nprescriptive, in that it is sometimes supposed to prescribe certain\nforms of behavior as acceptable and proscribe others as unacceptable.\nOn another level, its scope or range of application is unfixed. Some\nnatural law theories pertain to political entities (typically states\nand relations among states); others, to civil laws; yet others, to\nmoral agents. On still another level, the ambiguities can be seen as\nstemming from the very notions of \u201cnatural\u201d and\n\u201claw\u201d. \u201cNatural\u201d can refer to human nature, or\nto the nature of the universe in general, or both. One\u2019s sense\nof the validity and force of a natural law theory will vary enormously\ndepending on which reference is employed. \u201cLaw\u201d was\nsimilarly contested. One extreme interpreted it literally, so that a\nnatural law is a rule implemented by some agent (typically God) which\ncompels obedience on pain of some penalty. The other extreme took\n\u201claw\u201d completely metaphorically, picking out some standard\nor norm perceivable in natural phenomena which governs behavior\nthrough entirely impersonal means.\n\nSuch variation should not be surprising, for the natural law tradition\nwas long and robust. Though there were ties to the ancient world, it\nbegan in earnest with Aquinas, since he was the first to formulate a\ngroup of ideas systematic enough to be called a theory. The tradition\ncontinued through the middle ages and into the early modern era before\n(allegedly) meeting its demise in Kant. Given that natural law was\nthe dominant paradigm in ethics, politics and law for\nhundreds of years\u2014much longer than the period from Kant to\nus\u2014it is entirely predictable that theorists would have pushed\nthat paradigm in so many directions. It may be that there is some\nessence shared by all natural law theories; for example, one recent\ncommentator has suggested that the\n\n\nstable core in [the natural law tradition] is the idea that morals is\nprimarily a matter of norms or prescriptions and only derivatively\nabout virtues and values. (Haakonssen 1992: 884)\n\n\nBut those who study natural law in the period of its flourishing will\nbe impressed by the almost unlimited possibilities of\ninterpretation.\n\nThough this is not an article on the natural law, these points are\nnecessary preliminaries for considering Grotius\u2019 natural law\nviews. If Grotius is at all known to philosophers today, it is for\nbeing \u201cthe father of natural law\u201d (as put by, e.g.,\nVreeland 1917). At this juncture, we need not assess the validity of\nthis claim (for more on Grotius\u2019 originality, see\n Section 6\n below). Instead, we ought to understand Grotius\u2019 actual views\non the laws of nature. To understand his views, four issues need to be\nexamined: first, the source of the laws; second, their nature or\ncontent; third, their force or obligatory status; finally, their\nscope.\n\nWhy are there natural laws? Do they exist in virtue of the nature of\nthings or for some other reason? These are the questions lurking\nbehind the issue of source. Grotius changed his mind on how they\nshould be answered. In the DIP he declares that\n\n\nWhat God has shown to be His Will, that is law. This axiom points\ndirectly to the cause of law, and is rightly laid down as the primary\nprinciple. (Chap. II)\n\n\nHere Grotius announces a thesis about the relation between normativity\nand the divine being which is commonly known as\n\u201cvoluntarist\u201d: by an act of volition, God determines the\nfull and exact content of all normative categories\u2014justice,\ngoodness and so forth. Voluntarism was a well-established tradition of\nnatural law theories; the DIP belongs firmly in that\ntradition. In later works, however, Grotius departs from it. For\nexample, in the De summa potestatum, he declares that\nnormativity of any kind\n\n\narises from the nature of the action itself, so that it is right\nper se to worship God and it is right per se not to\nlie. (Opera Omnia Theologica vol. III, p. 187)\n\n\nA much more famous expression of non-voluntarism appears in the\n\u201cProlegomena\u201d to the DIB. In the first few\nsections of the \u201cProlegomena\u201d, Grotius lays the groundwork\nfor his natural law theory. Then, in section eleven, he writes\nthat\n\n\nWhat we have been saying would have a degree of validity even if we\nshould concede [etiamsi daremus] that which cannot be\nconceded without the utmost wickedness, that there is no God, or that\nthe affairs of men are of no concern to him.\n\n\nInstead of emerging from or being otherwise dependent on God, the\nfundamental principles of ethics, politics and law obtain in virtue of\nnature. As he says, \u201cthe mother of right\u2014that is, of\nnatural law\u2014is human nature\u201d (Prol. \u00a716). Somewhat\nlater, he clarifies why it is that human nature produces the natural\nlaw:\n\n\nThe law of nature is a dictate of right reason, which points out that\nan act, according as it is or is not in conformity with rational\nnature, has in it a quality of moral baseness or moral necessity; and\nthat, in consequence, such an act is either forbidden or enjoined.\n(I.1.10.1)\n\n\nIf an action agrees with the rational and social aspects of human\nnature, it is permissible; if it doesn\u2019t, it is impermissible\n(cf. I.1.12.1). That is to say, the source of the natural law is the\n(in)compatibility of actions with our essences as rational and social\nbeings. For discussion of the etiamsi daremus passage, see\nSt. Leger (1962) and Todescan (2003).\n\nSuppose we have established where the laws come from. This will reveal\nnothing about the second of our four issues: viz., the content of the\nlaws or what they actually say. Grotius\u2019 views on how we should\nlearn about this were quite consistent: throughout his corpus, he\ncontinued to maintain that (as he put it in the DIP),\n\n\nThe Will of God is revealed, not only through oracles and portents,\nbut above all in the very design of the Creator; for it is from this\nlast source that the law of nature is derived. (Chap. II)\n\n\nAs he put it in the DIB, the law of nature \u201cproceeds\nfrom the essential traits implanted in man\u201d (Prol. \u00a712).\nWhere some other natural law theories solved the problem of knowledge\nthrough recourse to the supernatural, Grotius did not. For him, a\nstudy of nature itself\u2014and more specifically, a study of human\nnature\u2014can suffice to teach us the essentials of ethics,\npolitics and law.\n\nAnd what, exactly, does such a study reveal about those fundamental\nnormative principles? The reasoning in both the DIP and\nDIB may be reconstructed as follows. Human nature is\nconstituted by two essential properties: the desire for\nself-preservation and the need for society (see DIP, Chap. 2,\nand DIB, Prol. \u00a7\u00a76\u20137). These two properties\ntemper and inform each other: the desire for self-preservation is\nlimited by the social impulse, so that humans do not naturally seek to\nmaintain and enhance their being at all costs; conversely, the need\nfor the company of other humans is limited by the self-preservation\ndrive, for individuals must naturally strive to secure the means for\ntheir well-being. Moreover, the self-preservation drive and the\nsociability impulse are both emotive and cognitive; they are both\nnon-rational and rational, having the force of unreflective instinct\nas well as well-thought-out plans. Because we are essentially both\nsocial and self-preserving beings, it follows that two things are\nimperative for our successful existence. We ought to abstain from what\nbelongs to other persons, and we ought to engage in the reasonable\npursuit of what genuinely serves our interest. Accordingly, Grotius\nmakes these the first two elements of natural law in the DIB\n(see Prol. \u00a7\u00a78, 10); they form the core of the first four\n\u201claws\u201d in the DIP (see Chap. II). While these\nprinciples enjoy lexical priority in the hierarchy of natural norms,\nthey do not exhaust the list. A study of nature also teaches us that\n\u201cEvil deeds must be corrected\u201d and \u201cGood deeds must\nbe recompensed\u201d (Laws V\u2013VI of the DIP). In fact,\nGrotius derives a list of some 22 fundamental natural tenets in the\nDIP and a similarly large group (though not numbered in the\nsame way) in the DIB. Any explanation of Grotius\u2019\nnatural law theory should begin by citing these first-order tenets or\nprinciples, for they are what constitute its substance. Recent\nscholarship has sought to shed light on the foregoing issues by\nexamining how Grotius may have been inspired by Stoicism, both ancient\nand early modern. See in particular Brooke (2012: Chapter 2) and\nStraumann (2015).\n\nReturning to conceptual matters, we should ask why the laws of nature\nare operative on us. Why do they enjoin or prohibit us from performing\ncertain specific actions? Here we come to our third issue, concerning\nthe laws\u2019 force or obligatory status. Traditionally, natural law\ntheorists tended to invoke God for their solution to this very deep\nmystery. Aquinas, for example, argued that obligation is the result of\nan action of will by a superior on an inferior (see, e.g., Summa\nTheologica II.ii.q104). We are obliged to follow civil laws\nbecause our political superiors have forced us to do so through\nactions of their more powerful wills. And we are obliged to follow\nnatural laws because God has forced us to do so through his infinitely\nmore powerful will. Grotius was tempted by this view; he writes in\nDIB that morally necessary acts must be \u201cunderstood as\nnecessarily commanded or forbidden by God\u201d (I.1.10.2).\n\nAs any parent knows, however, \u201cbecause I said so\u201d is not\nthe most compelling reason for action. That is true even when the\nperson speaking is God. Hence thinkers have long sought to articulate\nother grounds for obligation. In Grotius\u2019 time, for example,\nSuarez wrote,\n\n\nto break the natural law without sinning involves an\ninconsistency\u2026 and therefore the existence of an obligation\nwhich is imposed by the natural law but which is not a matter of\nconscience also involves an inconsistency. (De legibus,\nII.IX.6)\n\n\nHere we find a very different account of the basis of obligation: we\nare obliged to perform or avoid certain actions which are incompatible\nwith our consciences, because we will be guilty of inconsistency if we\ndon\u2019t. To put it in slightly different terms, we are obliged to\nperform or avoid certain actions which are compatible or incompatible\nwith our natures as rational beings, because we will be less than\nhuman if we don\u2019t. Grotius adopts this idea for himself,\nmodifying it in keeping with his rich conception of human nature: for\nhim, natural law obliges us to perform actions which conduce to our\nrationality, sociability and need for self-preservation. This thought\nunderlies several of his specific laws of nature\u2014such as, for\ninstance, the law that evil deeds must be corrected. Grotius places\nthis obligation under the heading of compensatory justice\n(DIP, Chap. Two). The \u201ctask of compensatory\njustice\u201d is \u201crestitution\u201d: using the example of\ntheft, Grotius explains that \u201csuch justice requires that the\nthing taken shall be returned\u201d (ibid.). Evil deeds have\ndisturbed the moral and legal equilibrium of society; they have\nunjustly benefited some while unjustly harming others. Since it is\nimperative to maintain healthy social relations, it is imperative that\nevil deeds be punished.\n\nThe problem of explaining why we should obey the laws of\nnature\u2014or indeed, why we should obey any set of norms\u2014is\none of the most enduring in philosophy; it would be rash to suppose\nthat a solution can be found in Grotius. One inadequacy of his account\nis inspired by Richelieu: while Grotius tries to separate and equalize\nour rational, social and self-interested motives for action, one may\nquestion whether they are in fact distinct and equal. If it can be\nshown that one is more fundamental than the others\u2014that, say,\nself-interest is our first and most basic reason for action\u2014then\nour reason for obeying the laws of nature and being moral will be very\ndifferent from what Grotius argued. (For additional discussion, see\nKorsgaard 1996: 7, 21\u201322 and 28\u201330.)\n\nMoving on, we come to the last of our four issues\u2014i.e., scope.\nIn Grotius\u2019 day, this issue was made urgent by European\nencounters with indigenous peoples in the Americas and elsewhere (for\ndiscussion, see Tierney 1997: Chapter XI). Some theorists tried to\nplace epistemic or doxastic restrictions on the scope of the laws,\narguing that they enjoined and protected only those who held certain\nbeliefs. Since the beliefs which determined the applicability of the\nlaws were usually religious in nature, it was commonly argued that\nnatural laws were pertinent only to Christians and did not cover\nnon-Christians. Given that natural laws form the basis for morality,\nthen since they do not cover non-Christians, it follows that\nChristians were under no obligations to treat non-Christians morally.\nLike many others, Grotius strongly disagreed with such arguments. For\nhim, natural laws apply to all rational and social beings as such. It\ndoesn\u2019t matter what they think or believe; if they are rational\nand social, they are bound by the law of nature (see, e.g.,\nDIB II.20.44).\n",
