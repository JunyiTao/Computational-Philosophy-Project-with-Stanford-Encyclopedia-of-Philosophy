Managing and Communicating Reproductive Risk\n\nMany commentators have pointed out that we live in a \u2018risk\nsociety\u2019 (Beck 1992). The language of risk pervades our public\ndiscourse surrounding pregnancy and birth, both currently and\nhistorically (e.g. Hallgrimsdottir and Benner 2014). Where\ncost-benefit analyses serve as paradigms of rationality and hallmarks\nof efficiency, social problems are framed as exercises in risk\nmanagement. While most pregnancies in developed countries yield\nhealthy mothers and babies, pregnancy unavoidably involves risk for\nwomen and fetuses alike. Women generally care deeply about the\nwell-being of their future children, and hence are typically concerned\nwith managing reproductive risk. More broadly, as a social body, we\nhave a strong collective interest in the health and welfare of our\nfuture community members, and hence reproductive risk is a matter of\npublic concern.\n\nPregnancy is portrayed in our culture as fraught with risk on all\nsides, while at the same time even minimal risks to fetuses are\ntreated as intolerable (Kukla 2005, Lyerly et al. 2009). Many have\nargued that pregnant women (as opposed to policy makers, fathers,\nindustrial manufacturers, etc.) are disproportionately burdened with\nthe responsibility for managing reproductive risk (i.e., Armstrong\n2003, Kukla 2005, Rothman 2014). The combined force of these factors\nis that pregnant women are often expected to survey and discipline\nvirtually all aspects of their bodies and lives, from each bite they\neat, to which products they use, where they work and recreate, how\nthey lie in bed, which emotions they feel, and much more, in\naccordance with elaborate, ever-proliferating, ever-changing rules of\nrisk minimization (Duden 1993, Lupton 1998, Kukla 2005, Lyerly et al.\n2009).\n\nIn managing and communicating about reproductive risk, we face several\nchallenges. First and perhaps most obviously, while pregnant women and\nfetuses are inextricably physically intertwined, the risks and\npotential benefits to each of them of various actions, situations, and\ninterventions are typically different and can even be in tension.\nManaging risk can be especially complicated and ethically charged\ngiven this entwinement of two different sets of risks and potential\nbenefits. Second, as will be discussed below, there are various\nreasons why good-quality evidence about reproductive risk is hard to\ncome by, and hence we often must make decisions about how to manage\nsuch risk under a great deal of uncertainty. Third, features of our\ncultural context can distort our perceptions of reproductive risk\n(Drabble et al. 2011). Such distortions become ethically relevant to\nthe extent that they either lead us to decisions that are not, as they\npurport to be, in the best interests of babies or their mothers, or\nthat place inappropriate burdens and responsibilities on pregnant\nwomen that are not responsive to reality. The following sections\nsurvey some ethical issues that highlight these barriers to\nhigh-quality reasoning about reproductive risk.\n",
