Similar problems arise for the\nappeal to facts (as distinct from true propositions), properties, and\nevents in semantics. Here are several examples of substitution\nfailures.\n\n\\(S\\) found that the room was a mess.\n\nSo, \\(S\\) found the fact that the room was a mess. \n\nFreedom is on the march.\n\nSo, the property of freedom is on the march. \n\nI jumped a jump.\n\nSo, I jumped an event (of jumping). \n\nA difficulty for Defensive Response #1 is that it seems to spread a\nproblem around rather than solve it. One might argue that relational\nanalyses invoking propositions, facts, properties, and events all make\nthe same mistake of reading too much ontology into English.\n\nDefensive Response #2. From \u2018\\(S\\) believes that\n\\(p\\)\u2019 we can infer \u2018\\(S\\) believes the\nproposition that \\(p\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(S\\) believes a\nproposition.\u2019 And the same goes for \u2018reject\u2019,\n\u2018assert\u2019, \u2018deny\u2019, and many other attitude\nverbs. If we concede that these sentences assert relations to\npropositions, then we are conceding that there are propositions.\n\nApart from such defensive replies, though, the relationalist might\nattempt to solve the problems. We will discuss several approaches.\n",
