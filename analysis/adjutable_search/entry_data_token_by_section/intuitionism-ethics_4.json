    "main_text": "Intuitionist epistemology || Non-inferential justification?\n1.5 Non-inferential justification?\n\n\nSinnott-Armstrong claims that results from empirical psychology\nshow that most of our moral beliefs are false, because they have been\nformed by an unreliable process (2006, 353). The unreliable process is\nbasing them on intuitions that are systematically distorted by morally\nirrelevant factors, such as order or wording. Sinnott-Armstrong\ndoesn\u2019t deny that some moral intuitions can justify moral\nbeliefs. But given that the default justification provided by so many\nof them is undermined by distorting factors, we need to check that some\nmoral intuition is not one of the undermined ones before we can take it\nto provide justification. But then, he argues, the intuitions that do\nprovide justification do so only inferentially. Since moral intuitions\neither don\u2019t provide justification at all, or do so only\ninferentially, there is no non-inferential justification for our moral\nbeliefs and intuitionism is false.\n\n\nNathan Ballantyne and Joshua C. Thurow (2013) maintain that this\nargument does not work. They outline their point in terms of\nundercutting defeaters and defeaters of those defeaters. The distorting\nfactors that Sinnott-Armstrong mentions are the undercutting defeaters\nof the justification of most of our moral beliefs. If we have evidence\nthat a subclass of our moral beliefs is not subject to these\nundercutting defeaters, then that evidence defeats the defeater, and\njustification is restored.\n\n\nWith this jargon in hand they argue that Sinnott-Armstrong\u2019s argument\nconflates the belief\u2019s justification being supported by an\ninference with the belief itself being supported by an\ninference. Let U signify the undercutting defeaters for a moral\nbelief, D the evidence that defeats these defeaters, and B the\nmoral belief. Sinnott-Armstrong argues that for D to defeat U and\nthus restore the justification for B, D must provide the agent\nwith a reason to believe that B was formed reliably. But,\nBallantyne and Thurow maintain, D can defeat U independently of\nthe agent\u2019s ability to provide arguments for his belief. My belief is\njustified only on the basis of the following argument:\n\nD, \nD defeats U, \n therefore, U is defeated.\n\n\n\nSo this inference supports B\u2019s justification. But B itself is\nnot supported by that inference. B is, they claim, supported by the\nrelevant intuition alone. (414). Being able to argue that the original,\nnon-inferential justification for B has not been undermined, does not\nentail being able to argue for B. All this argument does is restore the\noriginal non-inferential justification for the belief.\n\n\nBallantyne and Thurow illustrate this point with the following\nnon-moral example.\n \n\nMcCoy visits the local widget factory and sees what seems to be a\nred widget being carried along a conveyor belt. He believes that the\nwidget is red\u2026. Soon enough, a stranger approaches McCoy and\nsays that the widgets are actually white but are illuminated by red\nlights\u2026 Upon seeing this conversation, another\nstranger\u2014who seems to McCoy to be a factory employee\u2014tells\nMcCoy not to listen to the other stranger: he is a trickster, McCoy is\ntold, who likes to mess around with visitors. (2013, 413)\n\n\nSinnott-Armstrong would say that in order for the undercutting\ndefeater (the 1st stranger\u2019s comment) to be defeated by the\nfactory worker\u2019s claim that the stranger is a trickster, the factory\nworker\u2019s comment must provide McCoy with a reason to think that his\nbelief was formed reliably. But, Ballantyne and Thurow claim, all that\nhas happened is that the original, non-inferential justification has\nbeen restored. \u201cWhatever initially made B justified continues\nto justify B once the defeater has been defeated.  McCoy\u2019s belief\nthat the widget is red is justified by his perceptual experience or\nseeming\u201d (414). The same can be said of moral intuitions. I may\nregard my moral belief as justified by an intuition with the same\ncontent if I am justified in believing that potential undercutting\ndefeaters have been defeated (or are absent). In such a case I have an\ninferential argument for the justification of my moral belief, but\nthat does not mean that I have an inferential justification for my\nmoral belief. All that has happened, is that the original,\nnon-inferential justification (provided by the intuition) has been\nrestored.\n\n\nNonetheless, Ballantyne and Thurow do not question the first part of\nSinnott- Armstrong\u2019s argument\u2014that is, the claim that\nbecause of partiality, bias, emotion and disagreement, we have good\nreason to think that most of our moral beliefs are false. If it is\ntrue, as Sinnott-Armstrong claims, that most of our moral beliefs are\nfalse, then intuitionists\u2019 trust in our ordinary moral thought\nwill look undermined regardless of whether they can salvage a few sound\nmoral beliefs from the wreckage. So intuitionists would not only have\nto argue that some intuitions justify non-inferentially, but that there\nis a significantly large group of reliable intuitions to validate their\nmethodology, and Ballantyne and Thurow\u2019s argument does not help\nwith that.\n",
