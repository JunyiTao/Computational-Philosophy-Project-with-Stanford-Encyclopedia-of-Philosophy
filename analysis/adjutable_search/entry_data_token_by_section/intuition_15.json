    "main_text": "Experimental Philosophy and Intuitions || The Experimental Evidence\n4.2 The Experimental Evidence\n\nFor experimental philosophers seeking to investigate the sources,\ncharacter, and distribution of intuitions of philosophical interest,\nthe primary method has consisted of asking subjects questions about\nhypothetical scenarios, or less frequently, about principles or\ngeneralizations. The evidence has been responses (whether binary\n[yes/no] responses or graded [Likert scale] responses) to such survey\nquestions. Those pursuing the sources project and the variation\nproject also aim to determine which factors co-vary with\nanswers\u2014cultural or ethnic group, socio-economic status, region\nof brain or cognitive processes implicated in answering the question,\npsychopathology, order of questions, framing of questions, etc.\n\nOf course, traditional first-person armchair methods seek to determine\nwhich features of the content of the scenario under consideration vary\nwith one\u2019s intuitions. Indeed, this is exactly how one endeavors\nto test or to make more precise some general thesis in many areas of\nphilosophy. Proponents of the sources project and the variation\nproject however, seek to determine which features of those considering\nthe scenario or of framing or presenting the same question vary with\nthe relevant intuitions.\n\nThere have been a variety of worries raised about the adequacy of\nsurvey methods as means of gaining access to intuitions of\nthe relevant sort. The strength of these worries vary according to the\nconception of intuition. If, as claimed by various sui\ngeneris state accounts\n (\u00a71.3),\n intuitions are not beliefs or mere dispositions to believe, then the\ninferential route from evidence consisting of survey responses to\nconclusions about intuitions is considerably lengthened.\n\nFirst, differences in responses may be produced by different ways of\n\u201cfilling in\u201d a schematic hypothetical case (Sosa 2007;\nHorvath 2015). Second, there may be multiple concepts answering to a\nsingle word (Sosa 2007). (For some recognition of this fact by\nexperimental philosophers, see the use of the\n\u201ccoin-flipping\u201d case by Weinberg et al. (2001) and Swain\net al. (2008) to exclude subjects who use \u201cS knows that\np\u201d to mean merely that S has high confidence that\np.) These two suggestions do not raise the possibility that\nthat the subjects in such surveys are not responding on the basis of\nintuitions. Rather, they raise the possibility that the intuitions are\nnot intuitions regarding the same property or about the same case.\n(See Alexander and Weinberg 2007 for the suggestion that both of these\nconcerns apply equally to non-solipsistic proponents of the\ntraditional armchair methodology.)\n\nA third, more general, worry is that such surveys run a risk of\neliciting from subjects responses determined by something other than\ntheir intuitions regarding the answer to the survey\nquestion\u2014e.g., by implicatures determined by what a sentence is\ntypically used to communicate (Adams and Steadman 2004; Deutsch 2009;\nBach 2002) and by more general pragmatic factors governing the\ndetermination of speaker meaning and task interpretation. These\nworries may be especially pressing in the odd and ambiguous context of\na set of hypothetical and often bizarre cases presented by a\nphilosopher to a philosophically na\u00efve subject unaware of the\nnature of the discipline (Scholl 2007: 580; Cullen 2010; Ludwig 2007).\nBengson (2013) argues that it is plausible that many survey responses\nare often not indicative of subjects\u2019 intuitions but are instead\nthe product of guesses, hunches, or inferences.\n\nSome proponents of survey methods claim that such worries have very\nlow prior probability and should not be taken seriously without\nexperimental confirmation. Those who raise them, however, claim to\nhave significant independent evidence of their general relevance\n(Cullen 2010; Scholl 2007) or their importance in producing the\nparticular results at issue (Bengson 2013). Some of these problems\nseem difficult to control for without engaging subjects in something\nlike philosophical dialogue and dialectic (see Kauppinen\n2007)\u2014i.e., by doing philosophy with them\u2014which is thought\nby many experimental philosophers to be a form of biasing or data\ncontamination.\n\nA final worry, of relatively recent vintage, concerns the extent to\nwhich the results in question are reproducible or robust. A number of\nrecent studies have provided reason to think that many published\npsychological results are not reproducible, with studies in social\npsychology being especially likely to fail attempts at reproduction.\nExactly what to make of this fact and how to respond to it is a matter\nof much current debate, but it should be noted that experimental\nphilosophers have begun to pay attention to the problem and to seek\nreplication of their results. The issue is quite complicated and the\nresearch moving quickly, but it appears that quite a few of the claims\nof cultural or gender differences have not proved robust\n(Seyedsayamdost 2014, 2015; Adleberg et al. 2014). These claims of\nvariation, as noted below, have been the primary empirical basis of\nskepticism regarding the evidential value of intuition.\n\nNothing precludes experimental philosophers from circumventing some of\nthe concerns just noted by using experimental paradigms other than the\nadministering of surveys. They may use reaction-time studies from\ncognitive psychology (Arico et al. 2011), empirical evidence from\nneuroscience (Allman and Woodward 2008; Greene et. al. 2001),\nevolutionary biology, or other sources. While such sources of evidence\nare not subject to the difficulties of surveys, they also appear\nunlikely to produce direct evidence of use to the verification project\nor the variability project because these projects require responses to\nthe abstract and detailed linguistic descriptions of cases one\ntypically presents in philosophical analysis. Indeed, Scholl (2007)\nsuggests that the most methodologically satisfactory experimental\nphilosophy will be primarily a version of the sources project\nimplicating rather low-level processes immune, in virtue of their\nmodularity, from the interpretive and pragmatic difficulties outlined\nabove.\n",
