There are numerous reasons for aiming to quantify medical\noutcomes. We may want to compare two or more treatments with respect\nto their efficacy at relieving certain symptoms or their ability to\nprevent deaths due to a certain disease. When resources are scarce, we\nmay not only want to invest in treatments that are efficacious (that\nis, they do improve patient morbidity, mortality or both) but also\nefficient (that is, it is more efficacious than other treatments\nrelative to the cost of procuring it). For matters of international\ncomparison, development and international justice, we also want to\nhave measures of disease burden: Which of a number of\ntropical diseases has the highest cost in terms of increased morbidity\nand mortality? For each research dollar spent on treatments for\ndisease X, how much can we expect to reduce the morbidity and\nmortality it causes?\n\nClinical trials now often report so-called patient-reported outcome\nmeasures or PROMs. A PROM is a questionnaire given to patients to\nevaluate certain aspects of their quality of life, functioning or\nhealth status after a medical intervention without interpretation of\nthe patient\u2019s response by a clinician or other people. It might\nask, for example, how difficult patients find it to climb up a flight\nof stairs after hip surgery or whether or not a cancer treatment helps\nthem to pursue their hobbies. The main goal of a PROM is the\nassessment of treatment benefit or risk in cases where the medical\noutcome is best known by the patient or best measured from the patient\nperspective.\n\nPROMs can vary considerably in length and complexity depending on the\nconcept that is being measured. In simple, straightforward cases\n(e.g., intensity of a certain kind of pain), a single question might\nsuffice. In others, it may be necessary to address several aspects of\na more complex functioning with a number of questions each. Either\nway, the design of the questionnaire should make sure that the\ninstrument reliably measures the concept of interest. The FDA\ndistinguishes the following six measurement properties or\n\u201ctests\u201d (FDA 2009: 11):\n\n Test-retest or intra-interviewer reliability (\u201cAre the\nscores stable over time when no change is expected in the concept of\ninterest?\u201d)\n Internal consistency (\u201cIs there a high correlation between\nthe responses that purport to measure the same concept?\u201d)\n Inter-interviewer reliability (\u201cIs there agreement among\nresponses when the PROM is administered by two or more different\ninterviewers?\u201d)\n Content validity (\u201cIs there evidence that the instrument\nmeasures the concept of interest?\u201d)\n Construct validity (\u201cIs there evidence that the\nrelationships between responses conform to expectations?\u201d)\n Ability to detect change (\u201cIs there evidence that the\ninstrument can identify differences in scores over time in individuals\nor groups who have changed with respect to the concept of\ninterest?\u201d).\n\n\nDespite their plausibility, these tests are not methodologically\ninnocuous. Content validity, for instance, is assessed on the basis of\nqualitative research in the form of patient interviews, focus groups,\nand qualitative cognitive interviewing (the latter refers to a method\nthat asks respondents to think aloud and describe their thought\nprocesses as they answer the instrument questions and involves\nfollow-up questions in a field test interview to gain a better\nunderstanding of how patients interpret questions). This qualitative\nresearch aims to develop questions with standardized meanings that are\nshared between patients and clinicians. Arguably, however, there will\nalways be differences in interpreting phrases such as \u201cbodily\npain\u201d or \u201cdifficulty in lifting one\u201ds arm\u2019\nbecause they refer to a patient\u2019s experiences, and these will\ndiffer from patient to patient and, in a given patient, from time to\ntime (Rapkin and Schwartz 2004). Moreover, there may be good\nphilosophical reasons to allow for the expression of a sufficient\narray of legitimate perspectives on health and quality of life instead\nof insisting on a standardization of meaning across patients and\ncontexts (McClimans 2010). Similarly, internal consistency can be\ndesirable only to the extent that the concept is a relatively simple\none and different questions really do address the same concept. It is\nof less relevance when the disorder is heterogeneous (McClimans and\nBrowne 2011). These kinds of worries can be raised with respect to\neach of the measurement tests. Finally, there is an issue when several\nPROMs that address a given disorder or treatment exist. Different\nPROMs will score differently with respect to the different tests, and\nthere is no universally valid schema to weigh their relative\nimportance (ibid.).\n\nDisability-adjusted life years or DALYs aim to measure burden of\ndisease. The measure was originally developed by Harvard University\nfor the World Bank and World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990 and is\nnow widely used by heath policy researchers for comparisons between\ncountries and over time and as a tool for policy making. It can also\nbe used to measure the effectiveness of interventions, though these\nare usually health policy rather than medical interventions\nnarrowly construed. The WHO makes regular global disease burden\nestimates in terms of DALYs at regional and global level for more than\n135 causes of disease and injury (Mathers et al. 2002).\n\nThe principal idea behind DALYs is simple. If a woman in Guatemala\ndies of Chagas disease at age 63, this adds 20 DALYs to the global\ndisease burden because her death is 20 years \u201cpremature\u201d\nas compared to Japanese life expectancy (which is taken as the\nstandard because it is the highest world wide). If a man in\nHamburg has an accident that confines him to the wheelchair for the\nrest of his life, this contributes 0.57 DALYs for each of his\nremaining life years because the weight for paraplegia is 0.57. Every\nkind of disease or impairment is thus given a number between 0 and 1\n(where 0 = full health and 1 = death) that makes it comparable to\nother conditions. For example, blindness has a weight of 0.43. As\nblindness contributes less to the burden of disease than paraplegia,\nthis means that blindness is regarded as the less severe of the two in\nterms of its reduction of functional capacity\n(Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn et al. 2003).\n\nThe simple idea is complicated by two adjustments, however. Typical\nburden of disease studies weigh an impairment differently depending on\nthe age of the person whose functional capacity is impaired by the\ndisease or disability. Blindness, say, has a greater impact on the\nburden of disease if it occurs at age 20 than if it occurs at very\nyoung or older ages (Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn et al. 2003).\nMoreover, if the man who has the accident now can be expected to live\nwith the disease for 30 years, future years of disability are\ndiscounted by a factor. The further into the future a disability\noccurs, the less it contributes to the disease burden\n(ibid.).\n\nThe adequacy of any socio-economic indicator has to be evaluated in\nthe light of the purpose that it is meant to serve (Reiss 2008). If\nDALYs are supposed to measure the everyday concept \u201cburden of\ndisease\u201d, we may criticize, for instance, that the indicator\nfails to take account of societal, cultural, climatic and other\nvariations within which the disease or disability occurs. Being\nparaplegic, say, is less burdensome when it occurs in societies that\nspend more resources on making public buildings and transport\nwheelchair accessible, that display more tolerance towards the\nhandicapped, or in flatter than in hillier regions. Arguably,\ntherefore, DALYs measure ill-health rather than disease burden (Anand\nand Hanson 1997). Similarly, because ill-health is measured as a\npercentage, a disease occurring in a person who is already handicapped\ncontributes less to the measure than the same disease occurring in an\notherwise comparable but not handicapped person. If DALYs are used to\nmake public health decisions, however, it might be better to\nprioritize those individuals who are least well off instead of those\nwho are relatively better off (ibid.).\n\nThe WHO is very explicit that numerous choices made in the\nconstruction of the DALY measure are value-based (Murray 1994;\nPr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn et al. 2003). Clearly, there is no matter\nof fact whether paraplegia constitutes a more severe impairment of\nsomeone\u2019s functional capacity than blindness, much less the\nprecise extent to which it contributes to the burden of disease. The\nsame is true of the duration of the time lost due to premature death,\nage weights and time preference. While any given choice will, due to\nits value-laden nature, be controversial, the WHO makes some efforts\nto represent societal preferences instead of, say, a priori\nphilosophical arguments. For example, the disability weights used in\nthe 2003 World Health Survey were based on health state valuations\nfrom large representative population samples in over 70 countries\n(Pr\u00fcss-\u00dcst\u00fcn et al. 2003: Ch. 3). Similarly, age\nweights are based on empirical studies that have indicated there is a\nbroad social preference to value a year lived by a young adult more\nhighly than a year lived by a young child, or lived at older ages\n(Murray 1996).\n",
