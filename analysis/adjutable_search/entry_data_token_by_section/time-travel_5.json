    "main_text": "The Grandfather Paradox || Improbable Coincidences\n2.2 Improbable Coincidences\nReturn to the original version of the Grandfather paradox and\nLewis\u2019s \u2018commonplace reasons\u2019 response to it. This\nresponse engenders a new objection\u2014due to Horwich\n(1987)\u2014not to the possibility but to the probability of\nbackwards time travel.\nThink about correlated events in general. Whenever we see two things\nfrequently occurring together, this is because one of them causes the\nother, or some third thing causes both. Horwich calls this the\nPrinciple of V-Correlation:\n if events of type A and B are associated with one\nanother, then either there is always a chain of events between\nthem\u2026or else we find an earlier event of type C that links up\nwith A and B by two such chains of events. What we do not see\nis\u2026an inverse fork\u2014in which A and B are connected only\nwith a characteristic subsequent event, but no preceding\none. (Horwich, 1987, 97\u20138)\n\nFor example, suppose that two students turn up to class wearing the\nsame outfits. That could just be a coincidence (i.e. there is no\ncommon cause, and no direct causal link between the two events). If it\nhappens every week for the whole semester, it is possible\nthat it is a coincidence, but this is extremely\nunlikely. Normally, we see this sort of extensive correlation\nonly if either there is a common cause (e.g. both students have\nproduct endorsement deals with the same clothing company, or both\nslavishly copy the same fashion blog) or a direct causal link\n(e.g. one student is copying the other).\n\n\nNow consider the time traveller setting off to kill her younger\nself. As discussed, no contradiction need ensue\u2014this is\nprevented not by chaperones or mysterious forces, but by a run of\nordinary occurrences in which the trigger falls off the time\ntraveller\u2019s gun, a gust of wind pushes her bullet off course,\nshe slips on a banana peel, and so on. But now consider this run of\nordinary occurrences. Whenever the time traveller contemplates\nauto-infanticide, someone nearby will drop a banana peel ready for her\nto slip on, or a bird will begin to fly so that it will be in the path\nof the time traveller\u2019s bullet by the time she fires, and so\non. In general, there will be a correlation between auto-infanticide\nattempts and foiling occurrences such as the presence of banana\npeels\u2014and this correlation will be of the type that does not\ninvolve a direct causal connection between the correlated events or a\ncommon cause of both. But extensive correlations of this sort are, as\nwe saw, extremely rare\u2014so backwards time travel will happen\nabout as often as you will see two people wear the same outfits to\nclass every day of semester, without there being any causal\nconnection between what one wears and what the other wears.\n\n\nWe can set out Horwich\u2019s argument this way:\n\nIf time travel were ever to occur, we should see extensive\nuncaused correlations. \nIt is extremely unlikely that we should ever see extensive\nuncaused correlations. \nTherefore time travel is extremely unlikely to occur.\n\nThe conclusion is not that time travel is impossible, but that we\nshould treat it the way we treat the possibility of, say, tossing a\nfair coin and getting heads one thousand times in a row. As Price\n(1996, 278 n.7) puts it\u2014in the context of endorsing\nHorwich\u2019s conclusion: \u201cthe hypothesis of time travel can\nbe made to imply propositions of arbitrarily low probability. This is\nnot a classical reductio, but it is as close as science ever\ngets.\u201d\n\n\nSmith (1997) attacks both premisses of Horwich\u2019s\nargument. Against the first premise, he argues that backwards time\ntravel, in itself, does not entail extensive uncaused\ncorrelations. Rather, when we look more closely, we see that time\ntravel scenarios involving extensive uncaused correlations always\nbuild in prior coincidences which are themselves highly\nunlikely. Against the second premise, he argues that, from the fact\nthat we have never seen extensive uncaused correlations, it does not\nfollow that we never shall. This is not inductive scepticism: let us\nassume (contra the inductive sceptic) that in the absence of any\nspecific reason for thinking things should be different in the future,\nwe are entitled to assume they will continue being the same; still we\ncannot dismiss a specific reason for thinking the future will\nbe a certain way simply on the basis that things have never\nbeen that way in the past. You might reassure an anxious friend that\nthe sun will certainly rise tomorrow because it always has in the\npast\u2014but you cannot similarly refute an astronomer who claims to\nhave discovered a specific reason for thinking that the earth will\nstop rotating overnight.\n\n\nSider (2002, 119\u201320) endorses Smith\u2019s second\nobjection. Dowe (2003) criticises Smith\u2019s first objection, but\nagrees with the second, concluding overall that time travel has not\nbeen shown to be improbable. Ismael (2003) reaches a similar\nconclusion. Goddu (2007) criticises Smith\u2019s first objection to\nHorwich. Further contributions to the debate include Arntzenius (2006)\nand Smeenk and W\u00fcthrich (2011, \u00a72.2). For a different\nargument to the same conclusion as Horwich\u2019s\u2014that time\ntravel is improbable\u2014see Ney (2000).\n",
