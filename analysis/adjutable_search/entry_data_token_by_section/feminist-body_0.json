Historical Background\n\nIt is unsurprising that early western feminists should have regarded\nembodiment with suspicion, choosing instead to stress the rational\npowers of the female mind; for as Fran\u00e7ois Poullain de la Barre\nfamously claimed in 1673, \u201cthe mind has no sex\u201d (1673\n[1990: 87]). For some early feminists this meant enthusiastically\nendorsing a dualism between mind and body, with bodily features\nregarded as contingent characteristics of the self, and the\npotentially rational minds as its core. For them, as indeed for later\nfeminists, it was essential to break any suggested deterministic link\nbetween corporeal characteristics, mental faculties and social role.\nReason, they mostly claimed, was a universal human capacity\nindependent of corporeal differences (Wollstonecraft, Mill and Taylor\nMill). There were additional reasons for early feminists such as\nWollstonecraft in the eighteenth century and Taylor Mill in the\nnineteenth, to regard their bodies with suspicion. In the context in\nwhich they lived as middle class women, their bodies were commodities\nto be preened and maintained, to enable them to entice men into\nmatrimony so that they would have the material means to live.\nWomen\u2019s attention to their bodies therefore took the form of\nproducing them as objects for others\u2019 appraisal, and the dangers\nwhich Wollstonecraft saw in this have been echoed in feminist work up\nto the present day. Wollstonecraft\u2019s 1792 text, A\nVindication of the Rights of Woman, provides, as Bordo (1993)\nnotes, a clear example of the disciplining of the female body\nas we, post- Foucault, would now describe it. \n\n\nTo preserve personal beauty, woman\u2019s glory! The limbs and\nfaculties are cramped with worse than Chinese bands, and the sedentary\nlife which they are condemned to live, whilst boys frolic in the open\nair, weakens the muscles \u2026 artificial notions of beauty, and\nfalse descriptions of sensibility have been early entangled with her\nmotives of action. (Wollstonecraft 1792 [1988: 55]) \n\n\nThe body was also a source of vulnerability. Mill and Taylor Mill were\npreoccupied with the way their susceptibility to illness interrupted\ntheir ability to produce philosophical work and cast the shadow of\nearly death over their life plans. Moreover any celebration of the\nfemale body as source of sensual pleasure was constrained by a risk of\npregnancy.\n\nThe body also came to prominence in nineteenth century feminism in\nBritain through the campaign led by Josephine Butler against the\nContagious Diseases Act (Jordan 2001). This act permitted women to be\nforcibly examined for venereal disease. Butler extended ideas of\nindividual rights, prominent within liberal political philosophy, to\nrights over one\u2019s body. The campaign of inspection was viewed as\na particularly outrageous violation of such rights and the women\nviewed as victims of male and medical appropriation of their bodies.\nHere we find the beginnings of arguments picked up later in campaigns\nagainst rape and sexual violence, as well as in campaigns for access\nto birth control and abortion, and in the feminist health movement;\nall of which stress women\u2019s rights to control what happens to\ntheir bodies. This absence of control found its most extreme example\nin the case of the bodies of slave women, where the body became\nliterally the property of another, disciplined in a way that bore a\nmarked contrast to that articulated by Wollstonecraft. \n\n\nHer back and her muscle \u2026 pressed into field labour where she\nwas forced to \u2026 work like men. Her hands were demanded to nurse\nand nurture the white man and his family \u2026 Her vagina used for\nhis sexual pleasure \u2026 the womb \u2026 the place of capital\ninvestment \u2026 the resulting child the \u2026 surplus worth\nmoney on the slave market. (Omolade 1983: 354)\n\n\nIn the nineteenth and early twentieth century the campaign for\nwomen\u2019s suffrage dominated feminist activity in the west. The\nSeneca Falls Convention Statement does not mention the body, but\nSojourner Truth\u2019s famous speech to the Ohio Women\u2019s\nConvention drew attention to the body as a marker of race and class\ndifferences within the feminist movement: \n\n\nI have as much muscle as any man, and can do as much work as any man.\nI have ploughed, and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man\ncould head me! And ain\u2019t I a woman? I could work as much and eat\nas much as a man\u2014when I could get it\u2014and bear de lash a\nwell! And ain\u2019t I a woman? (Truth 1851 [1881: 116]). \n\n\nMoreover, in the writings of Cady Stanton we find a recognition of the\nway bodily markers are used to perpetuate both racial and sexual\noppression: \n\n\nThe prejudice against color, of which we hear so much, is no stronger\nthan that against sex. It is produced by the same cause, and\nmanifested very much in the same way. The negro\u2019s skin and the\nwoman\u2019s sex are both prima facie evidence that they\nwere intended to be in subjection to the white Saxon man. (Stanton\n1860 [1881: 681])\n\n\nFollowing the first world war and the granting of suffrage in many\ncountries, women continued to campaign on issues of sexual equality,\nand control over their bodies. The issue of reproduction came to the\nfore in political philosophies of the right and left. On the political\nright, following the loss of life in the war, motherhood became a\nconcern of the state and a public duty. Moreover increasing concerns\nwith eugenics and racial purity led to a desire to control the\nreproduction of certain groups within society. At the same time,\nwithin United Kingdom feminist circles, the Abortion Reform\nAssociation was formed and echoed both earlier and later feminist\ndemands for the right of every woman to decide what should happen to\nher body. But an implicit dualism remained. The body was seen as\nsomething owned by, and thereby separate from, the self, something\nover which the self had rights.\n\nNonetheless in the early twentieth century, with the emergence of\npsychoanalysis, came a different model of our relationship to our\nbody, which was to become crucial to later feminist philosophers. For\nFreud the ego, the conscious sense of self, was a bodily ego:\n\u201cthe ego is first and foremost a bodily ego\u201d (Freud 1923\n[1962: 26]). This means that our sense of self is a sense of a body,\nand involves an awareness of that body as having a certain shape or\nform. Significantly, the shape or form we experience our body as\nhaving is not dictated simply by anatomy, but by the affective and\nsensory significance with which different parts are invested. (Freud\n1923). Certain aspects of the body have a salience, and other\nanatomical parts do not show up, unless painful, in the sense of our\nbody which constitutes our sense of self (the insides of the body,\nperhaps the back of the knees). Some parts are more significant than\nothers, linked to experiences of pleasure and pain, for example, or to\nthe possibility of effective agency, (the hands), to relations with\nothers, (the face). This insight of Freud and others (Schilder),\ninformed much of the critical theorizing around the body which\nfollowed.\n",
