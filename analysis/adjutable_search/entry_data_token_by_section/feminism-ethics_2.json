    "main_text": "Feminist Ethics: Historical Background || Nineteenth-Century Influences and Issues\n1.2 Nineteenth-Century Influences and Issues\n\nIn Europe and North America, nineteenth-century moral arguments\ncoalesced around material issues that would later be appreciated by\nfeminist ethicists as importantly intersecting. A remarkably diverse\narray of activist women and public intellectuals advanced recognizably\nfeminist arguments for women\u2019s moral leadership and greater\nfreedoms as moral imperatives. The resistance of enslaved women and\nthe political activism of their descendants, the anti-slavery\norganizations of women in Europe and North America, the attention to\ninequity in women\u2019s access to income, property, sexual freedom,\nfull citizenship, and enfranchisement, and the rise of Marxist and\nSocialist theories contributed to women\u2019s participation in\narguments for the reductions of militarism, unfettered capitalism,\ndomestic violence and the related abuse of drugs and alcohol, among\nother concerns.\n\nOffering the first occurrence of the term feminisme (Offen\n1988), the nineteenth century is characterized by a plurality of\napproaches to protofeminist ethics, that is, ethical theorizing that\nanticipated and created the groundwork for modern feminist concepts.\nThese include some theories consistent with the universal humanism of\nWollstonecraft and Condorcet and others emphasizing the differences\nbetween the sexes in order to argue for the superiority of feminine\nmorality. The most well-known of the former in philosophy are John\nStuart Mill\u2019s The Subjection of Women ([1869] 1987),\nwhich he credits Harriet Taylor Mill with co-authoring, and Harriet\nTaylor Mill\u2019s essay, \u201cThe Enfranchisement of Women\u201d\n(H. T. Mill [1851] 1998). Like their Enlightenment forerunners, Mill\nand Taylor argue that women ought to have equal rights and equal\naccess to political and social opportunities. As a utilitarian\nphilosopher, Mill further emphasizes the benefits to society and to\nthe human species of improving women\u2019s lives and social\nsituations. Mill expresses skepticism about claims that women are\nmorally superior to men, as well as claims that women have\n\u201cgreater liability to moral bias,\u201d emotionality, and poor\njudgment in ethical decision-making ([1869] 1987, 518 and 519). Mill\nand Taylor tend to overemphasize the roles of women who are wives.\nThey grant some differences between men and women that are\ncontroversial today; Mill\u2019s works especially emphasize the\nbenefits to family and domestic life as reasons to support the\nliberation of women from subjugation. Despite these views, both argue\nfor the benefits of women\u2019s liberation to scholarly and\npolitical spheres. For example, they describe differences in\nachievement and behavior to be the result mainly of women\u2019s\nsocial situations and education, making their view consistent with the\narguments of both the Enlightenment scholars noted above, and some,\nbut not all, of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century authors\ndiscussed below.\n\nAttitudes about the reasons for the moral goodness of such\nachievements differed. Some early utopian and Socialist movements in\nEurope that influenced women\u2019s rights activists in America and\nwould later influence British thinkers, including John Stuart Mill,\nlauded feminine virtues and women\u2019s importance, but did so in\nways that would reinforce views of women as \u201csuperior\u201d\nbecause of innate qualities of gentleness, love, spirituality, and\nsentimentality (Moses 1982). In contrast, other Socialist movements\nexpressed radical views of the equality of men and women not by\nattributing distinctive or greater moral virtues to women, but by\nchallenging systems of privilege due to sex, race, and class (Taylor\n1993). Although Mill and Taylor would later argue that \u201csexual\ninequality is an impediment to the cultivation of moral virtue,\u201d\nsome American activists such as Catherine Beecher forwarded a\n\u201cseparate-but-equal\u201d vision of men and women as\npsychologically and essentially different, a view \u201caccording to\nwhich female virtue is ultimately better than male virtue\u201d (Tong\n1993, 36 and 37). In the pivotal year of 1848, Frederick Douglass\ninsisted that \u201call that distinguishes man as an intelligent and\naccountable being, is equally true of woman\u201d (quoted in Davis\n2011, 51). In the same year, the Declaration of Sentiments\nwas signed at a women\u2019s rights convention in Seneca Falls, New\nYork, and socialist and anarchist revolutions took place in Europe.\nThe revolutionaries included public thinkers who advocated communal\nproperty and sexual equality, and who criticized the involvement of\nstate and church in marriage. Their arguments about practical and\nfeminist ethics influenced Emma Goldman and other turn-of-the-century\nthinkers.\n\nPhilosophical thinkers of different backgrounds gained greater access to education and printing presses in the nineteenth century, resulting in a plurality of approaches to the project of understanding, criticizing, and correcting how gender operates within our moral beliefs and practices. For example, the\nattachment of some protofeminist thinkers to the domestic virtues\nshaped their ethical recommendations. Some white and middle-class\nactivists argued for the end of slavery and, later, against the\nsubordination of emancipated women of color precisely on the grounds\nthat they wished to extend the privileges that white and middle-class\nwomen enjoyed in the domestic and private sphere, maintaining the\nsocial order while valorizing domestic feminine goodness. As Clare\nMidgley says, \u201cWomen\u2019s role was discussed in terms of\nfamily life. Emancipation would mark the end of the sexual\nexploitation of women and of the disruption of family life, and the\ncreation of a society in which the black woman was able to occupy her\nproper station as a Daughter, a Wife, and a Mother\u201d (Midgley\n1993, 351).\n\nIn contrast, some former slaves including Anna Julia Cooper and Ida B.\nWells-Barnett, and descendants of slaves including Mary Church\nTerrell, grounded their work for women\u2019s rights and arguments\nfor women\u2019s moral and sociopolitical equality in rather\ndifferent priorities, asserting more interest in equal protection of\nthe laws, economic liberation, political representation, and in\nWells-Barnett\u2019s case, self-defense and the exertion of the right\nto bear arms, as necessary to the very survival and liberation of\nBlack Americans (Giddings 2007). Cooper, who rightly criticized white\nfeminists for racist (and female-supremacist) statements when they\nwere offered as reasons to work for white women\u2019s voting rights\nrather than Black men\u2019s, advanced a view of virtues and truth as\nhaving masculine and feminine sides. A century before care ethics\nwould become a strain of academic feminist ethics, Cooper urged that\nboth masculine reason and feminine sympathy \u201care needed to be\nworked into the training of children, in order that our boys may\nsupplement their virility by tenderness and sensibility, and our girls\nmay round out their gentleness by strength and self-reliance\u201d\n(Cooper [1892] 2000, 60). Her timeless concern for the U.S. was that a\nnation or a people \u201cwill degenerate into mere emotionalism on\nthe one hand, or bullyism on the other, if dominated by either\nexclusively\u201d (61). Hers is a normative argument for appreciating\nthe contributions that both traditionally feminine and masculine\nvalues could offer to a well-balanced ethics.\n\nExplicitly arguing that standpoints matter to knowledge claims and\nmoral theorizing, Cooper insisted that historical knowledge necessary\nto a nation\u2019s self-understanding depends on the representation\nof Black Americans\u2019 voices, and especially the \u201copen-eyed\nbut hitherto voiceless Black Woman of America\u201d (Cooper [1892]\n2000, 2; Gines 2015). Manifesting Cooper\u2019s call for\nrepresentations, Wells-Barnett determinedly included accounts of girls\nand women killed by lynching along with the narratives of murdered men\nand boys, and challenged the \u201cracial-sexual apologies for\nlynching to trample the twin myths of white (female) sexual purity and\nblack (male) sexual savagery\u201d (James 1997, 80).\nWells-Barnett\u2019s investigative journalism led her to the blunt\nsuggestion that some of the sexual relationships giving rise to cover\nstories of rape as justifications for lynching were consensual\nrelationships between white women and Black men, while rapes of Black\nwomen and girls, \u201cwhich began in slavery days, still continues\nwithout reproof from church, state or press\u201d (quoted in Sterling\n1979, 81).\n",
