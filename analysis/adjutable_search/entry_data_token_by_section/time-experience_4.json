    "main_text": "Past, present and the passage of time\n5. Past, present and the passage of time\n\nThe previous section indicated the importance of distinguishing\nbetween perceiving the present and perceiving something as\npresent. We may perceive as present items that are past. Indeed, given\nthe finite speed of the transmission of both light and sound (and the\nfinite speed of transmission of information from receptors to brain),\nit seems that we only ever perceive what is past. However, this does\nnot by itself tell us what it is to perceive something as present,\nrather than as past. Nor does it explain the most striking feature of\nour experience as-of the present: that it is constantly changing. The\npassage (or apparent passage) of time is its most striking feature,\nand any account of our perception of time must account for this aspect\nof our experience.\n\nHere is one attempt to do so. The first problem is to explain why our\ntemporal experience is limited in a way in which our spatial\nexperience is not. We can perceive objects that stand in a variety of\nspatial relations to us: near, far, to the left or right, up or down,\netc. Our experience is not limited to the immediate vicinity (although\nof course our experience is spatially limited to the extent that\nsufficiently distant objects are invisible to us). But, although we\nperceive the past, we do not perceive it as past, but as present.\nMoreover, our experience does not only appear to be temporally\nlimited, it is so: we do not perceive the future, and we do not\ncontinue to perceive transient events long after information from them\nreached our senses. Now, there is a very simple answer to the question\nwhy we do not perceive the future, and it is a causal one. Briefly,\ncauses always precede their effects; perception is a causal process,\nin that to perceive something is to be causally affected by it;\ntherefore we can only perceive earlier events, never later ones. So\none temporal boundary of our experience is explained; what of the\nother?\n\nThere seems no logical reason why we should not directly\nexperience the distant past. We could appeal to the principle that\nthere can be no action at a temporal distance, so that something\ndistantly past can only causally affect us via more proximate events.\nBut this is inadequate justification. We can only perceive a spatially\ndistant tree by virtue of its effects on items in our vicinity (light\nreflected off the tree impinging on our retinas), but this is not seen\nby those who espouse a direct realist theory of perception as\nincompatible with their position. We still see the tree, they\nsay, not some more immediate object. Perhaps then we should look for a\ndifferent strategy, such as the following one, which appeals to\nbiological considerations. To be effective agents in the world, we\nmust represent accurately what is currently going on: to be constantly\nout of date in our beliefs while going about our activities would be\nto face pretty immediate extinction. Now we are fortunate in that,\nalthough we only perceive the past it is, in most cases, the very\nrecent past, since the transmission of light and sound, though finite,\nis extremely rapid. Moreover, although things change, they do so,\nagain in most cases, at a rate that is vastly slower than the rate at\nwhich information from external objects travels to us. So when we form\nbeliefs about what is going on in the world, they are largely accurate\nones. (See Butterfield 1984 for a more detailed account along these\nlines.) But, incoming information having been registered, it needs to\nmove into the memory to make way for more up to date information. For,\nalthough things may change slowly relative to the speed of light or of\nsound, they do change, and we cannot afford to be simultaneously\nprocessing conflicting information. So our effectiveness as agents\ndepends on our not continuing to experience a transient state of\naffairs (rather in the manner of a slow motion film) once information\nfrom it has been absorbed. Evolution has ensured that we do not\nexperience anything other than the very recent past (except when we\nare looking at the heavens).\n\nTo perceive something as present is simply to perceive it: we do not\nneed to postulate some extra item in our experience that is \u2018the\nexperience of presentness.\u2019 It follows that there can be no\n\u2018perception of pastness\u2019. In addition, if pastness were\nsomething we could perceive, then we would perceive\neverything in this way, since every event is past by the time\nwe perceive it. But even if we never perceive anything as past (at the\nsame time as perceiving the event in question) we could intelligibly\ntalk more widely of the experience of pastness: the experience we get\nwhen something comes to an end. And it has been suggested that\nmemories\u2014more specifically, episodic memories, those of\nour experiences of past events\u2014are accompanied by a feeling of\npastness (see Russell 1921). The problem that this suggestion is\nsupposed to solve is that an episodic memory is simply a memory of an\nevent: it represents the event simpliciter, rather than the\nfact that the event is past. So we need to postulate something else\nwhich alerts us to the fact that the event remembered is past. An\nalternative account, and one which does not appeal to any\nphenomenological aspects of memory, is that memories dispose us to\nform past-tensed beliefs, and is by virtue of this that they represent\nan event as past.\n\nWe have, then, a candidate explanation for our experience of being\nlocated at a particular moment in time, the (specious) present. And as\nthe content of that experience is constantly changing, so that\nposition in time shifts. But there is still a further puzzle. Change\nin our experience is not the same thing as experience of change. We\nwant to know, not just what it is to perceive one event after another,\nbut also what it is to perceive an event as occurring after another.\nOnly then will we understand our experience of the passage of time. We\nturn, then, to the perception of time order.\n",
