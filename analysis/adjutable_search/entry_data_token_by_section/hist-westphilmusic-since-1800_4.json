    "main_text": "Nineteenth Century || Nietzsche\n1.5 Nietzsche\n\nThe main elements of Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s (1844\u20131900)\nmusical aesthetics are laid out in his first book, The Birth of\nTragedy (1872), which bears the clear influence of Schopenhauer\nand is dedicated to Wagner. The book describes the world as torn\nbetween two tendencies or principles, the Apollonian and the\nDionysian.\n\nThe Apollonian element is the rational view of reality as subject to\nthe principium individuationis, a concept that Nietzsche\nborrows from Schopenhauer (see\n \u00a71.2).\n While ultimately an illusion, the Apollonian order of reality is\nnecessary to the formation of any civilization. In opposition to the\nApollonian, the Dionysian is the awareness of the fundamental unity of\nall beings, again in analogy with Schopenhauer\u2019s metaphysical\nWill. If the former impulse is expressed in peaceful contemplation,\nthe latter is manifested in states of ecstatic frenzy, which ought\nhowever to be contained in order to spare individuals and\ncivilizations from self-destruction. According to Nietzsche, only in\nthe balance between the two tendencies is life bearable.\n\nIn this picture, the arts differ in to the degree to which they embody\none of these two tendencies. Sculpture is the Apollonian art par\nexcellence, while music possesses to the highest degree the\nDionysian component. The reasons for the identification of music as\nDionysian are complex to reconstruct. Sorgner (20003 [2010:\n147\u2013149]) isolates three: (1) music relies on an experience of\nflow and temporal change; (2) music represents pain and strife through\nits use of dissonances; (3) music induces states of intoxication and\nself-forgetfulness through which we experience the fundamental unity\nof the world.\n\nGreek tragedy is characterized by Nietzsche as the supreme artistic\nachievement because it expresses both tendencies. This, at least, is\ntrue of Aeschylus\u2019 and Sophocles\u2019 tragedies. Euripides,\ninfluenced by Socratic rationalism, expunged the Dionysian element\nfrom tragedy. Once tragedy lost its Dionysian element, it was also\ndeprived of its redeeming power. According to Nietzsche,\nWagner\u2019s operas are to be credited for having brought back the\nsynthesis of Apollonian and Dionysian elements, and thus to have made\nagain available the redeeming power of the Greek tragedy.\n\nThe second part of The Birth of Tragedy is wedded to the\nWagnerian agenda to such an extent that is has been defined as\n\u201cby far the most ambitious defence of an individual artist ever\nmounted by a philosopher\u201d (Ridley 2007: 31). Despite\nNietzsche\u2019s early enthusiastic endorsement of Wagner\u2019s\nwork, his infatuation with the composer soon began to fade, and\nfinally turned into outright condemnation (on Nietzsche\u2013Wagner\nrelations, see Ridley 2007: appendix; Young 2014: epilogue; Prange\n2013: chapters 1\u20136). While the reasons for this are complex, it\nseems clear that Wagner\u2019s failure to embody the values of truly\nDionysian music was crucial. This failure depended not only on\nWagner\u2019s own stylistic development, but also on\nNietzsche\u2019s reconsideration of the composer\u2019s earlier\nachievement. Nietzsche later contrasts German and Romantic music with\nDionysian music, which clashes with Nietzsche\u2019s own earlier\ncharacterization of German music, and especially Wagner\u2019s, as\ntruly Dionysian (Nietzsche 1872: \u00a719; about the contrast between\nDionysian and Romantic art more generally, see Ridley 2007:\n122\u2013128). In Beyond Good and Evil (1886), Nietzsche\ncontrasts the decadent music of the North to that of the South,\nepitomized by Bizet\u2019s work, the chief value of which lies in its\nlife-affirming quality (Nietzsche 1886: \u00a7554).\n\nAs is apparent from the above, Nietzsche\u2019s evaluation of musical\nstyles changed along with his philosophical views. Concrete examples\nof music he praises vary from Wagner\u2019s Tristan and\nIsolde to Bizet\u2019s Carmen. The clearest set of\nevaluative claims is found in The Birth of Tragedy, where\nopposition emerges between Apollonian and Dionysian music. The latter\nis obviously considered by Nietzsche as superior to the former, as he\ndefines music as the art in which the Dionysian is present in the\nhighest degree. Nietzsche offers little in terms of a clear\ndistinction between the two, but he seems to think of Dionysian music\nas privileging melodic and harmonic components, whereas Apollonian\nmusic stresses rhythmical ones. Two other elements of\nNietzsche\u2019s view of music can be singled out, and\nSchopenhauer\u2019s influence on both is evident. First, Nietzsche\nbelieves that music should never be subservient to a text (Nietzsche\n1872: \u00a719). Secondly, Nietzsche holds that music ought to avoid\ntone-painting, which is merely an imitation of the world\u2019s\nappearance (Nietzsche 1872: \u00a717). But if Nietzsche\u2019s early\nmusical aesthetics is close to Schopenhauer in his negative\ncharacterization of what is valuable in music, his positive notion of\nmusical value departs significantly from Schopenhauer\u2019s, as\nNietzsche holds that music\u2019s value is partly to be located in\nits capacity to arouse emotions or induce a certain psychological\nstate (Nietzsche 1872: \u00a72).\n\nIt is more daunting a task to reconstruct Nietzsche\u2019s views on\nmusic after The Birth of Tragedy. In addition to the already\nmentioned distancing from Wagner, a relevant change in\nNietzsche\u2019s view is found in some remarks from Human, All\nToo Human (1878), which constitute a wholesale rejection of his\nearlier views concerning the relationship between music and language.\nIn this work, musical meaning and expressiveness are described as a\nproduct of music\u2019s longstanding association with poetic language\nand expressive gestures (Nietzsche 1878: \u00a7 215\u201316). Only\nthrough these associations is it possible for instrumental music to\nacquire meaning:\n\n\nNo music is in itself profound and meaningful, it does not speak of\nthe \u201cwill\u201d or of the \u201cthing in itself\u201d.\n(Nietzsche 1878 [1996]: \u00a7 215; on Nietzsche\u2019s late musical\naesthetics, see Higgins 1986; Young 1992: chapters 3\u20135; and\nPrange 2013: chapter 6)\n\n",
