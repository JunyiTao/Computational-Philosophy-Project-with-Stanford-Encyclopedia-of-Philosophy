    "main_text": "The Role of Introspection in Scientific Psychology || The Decline of Scientific Introspection\n3.3 The Decline of Scientific Introspection\n\nAlthough introspective psychologists were able to build scientific\nconsensus on some issues concerning sense experience\u2014issues such\nas the limits of sensory perception in various modalities and some of\nthe contours of variation in sensory experience\u2014by the early\n20th century it was becoming clear that on many issues consensus was\nelusive. The most famous dispute concerned the existence of\n\u201cimageless thought\u201d (see the discussion of the imageless\nthought controversy in the entry\n mental imagery;\n see also Humphrey 1951; Kusch 1999); but other topics proved\nsimilarly resistant such as the structure of emotion or\n\u201cfeeling\u201d (James 1890 [1981]; K\u00fclpe 1893 [1895];\nWundt 1896 [1902]; Titchener 1908 [1973]) and the experiential changes\nbrought about by shifts in attention (Wundt 1896 [1902]; Pillsbury\n1908; Titchener 1908 [1973]; Chapman 1933).\n\nBy the 1910s,\n behaviorism\n (which focused simply on the relationship between outward stimuli and\nbehavioral response) had declared war on introspective psychology,\nportraying it as bogged down in irresolvable disputes between\ndiffering introspective \u201cexperts\u201d, and also rebuking the\nintrospectivists\u2019 passive taxonomizing of experience,\nrecommending that psychology focus instead on socially useful\nparadigms for modifying behavior (e.g., Watson 1913). In the 1920s and\n1930s, introspective studies were increasingly marginalized. Although\nstrict behaviorism declined in the 1960s and 1970s, its main\nreplacement, cognitivist\n functionalism\n (which treats functionally defined internal cognitive processes as\ncentral to psychological inquiry), generally continued to share\nbehaviorism\u2019s disdain of introspective methods.\n\nPsychophysics (the study of the relationship between physical sensory\ninput and consequent psychological state or response), where the\nintrospective psychologists had found their greatest success,\nunderwent a subtle shift in this period from a focus on\nsubjective methods\u2014methods that involve asking subjects\nto report on their experiences or percepts\u2014to a focus on\nobjective methods such as asking participants to report on\nstates of the outside world, including insisting that participants\nguess even when they feel they don\u2019t know or have no relevant\nconscious experience (especially with the rise of \u201csignal\ndetection theory\u201d in psychophysics: Green and Swets 1966;\nCheesman and Merikle 1986; Macmillan and Creelman 1991; Merikle,\nSmilek, and Eastwood 2001). Perhaps in accord with transparency views\nof introspection (Section 2.3.4 above), the two types of instruction\nseem very similar (compare the subjective \u201ctell me if you\nvisually experience a flash of light\u201d with the objective\n\u201ctell me if the light flashes\u201d). On the other hand,\nperhaps in tension with transparency views, subjective and objective\ninstructions seem sometimes to differ importantly, especially in cases\nof known illusion, Gestalt effects such as perceived grouping, stimuli\nnear the limits of perceivability, and the experience of ambiguous\nfigures (Boring 1921; Merikle, Smilek, and Eastwood 2001; Siewert\n2004).\n",
