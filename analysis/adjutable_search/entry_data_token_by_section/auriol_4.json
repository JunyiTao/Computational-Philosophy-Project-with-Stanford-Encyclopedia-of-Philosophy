    "main_text": "The Character of Auriol\u2019s Thought and Some Noteworthy Positions || Future Contingents and Divine Foreknowledge\n2.3 Future Contingents and Divine Foreknowledge\n\nAuriol developed influential theories on future contingents and divine\nforeknowledge. These take their starting point in two convictions that\nAuriol firmly holds. First, he maintains that immutability and\nnecessity are mutually implicative, and thus, since God is immutable,\nif he were to know the future, the future would be necessary. (This\nsame conviction led Auriol to reject, at least in some contexts, the\nuse of the popular later-medieval distinction between God\u2019s\nabsolute and ordained powers. For Auriol, there is no genuine\npossibility in God to will other than he does.) Second, Auriol took as\na fundamental principle the existence of human free will (on\nAuriol\u2019s theory of free will, see Hoffmann 2015; Alliney 2015).\nThese two principles lead Auriol to theorize that God does know the\nfuture, but not as future; rather God knows the future\nindistantly, as abstracted from all time; it is therefore\nthis special way of knowing the future that preserves human freedom\nand avoids divine necessitarianism. In accordance with this view,\nAuriol develops a three-valued logic, in which future-tensed\npropositions are neutral, admitting of neither truth nor falsity,\nthereby discarding the principle of bivalence (the principle claiming\nthat any proposition can have only one of two truth values).\nAuriol\u2019s position on future contingents and divine foreknowledge\nhad a great deal of impact in the later Middle Ages, since it often\ninspired refutations that nevertheless took into account the\ncriticisms that Auriol had made of, e.g., Thomas Aquinas, Henry of\nGhent, and John Duns Scotus (Schabel 2000a). When Auriol\u2019s view\nactually found an adherent in Peter de Rivo at the University of\nLouvain (Leuven) in the period 1465\u201374, it occasioned a major\ndebate involving in the end Pope Sixtus IV, who in 1474 officially\ncondemned aspects of Auriol\u2019s view. Despite this condemnation,\nhowever, it appears that Auriol\u2019s critique of earlier scholastic\nviews and some elements of his own theory on the topic influenced the\nhumanist Pietro Pomponazzi around 1520, and perhaps as well the\nreformer Martin Luther (Schabel 2003).\n",
