    "main_text": "\n\nReasoning is defeasible when the corresponding argument is\nrationally compelling but not deductively valid. The truth of the\npremises of a good defeasible argument provide support for the\nconclusion, even though it is possible for the premises to be true and\nthe conclusion false. In other words, the relationship of support\nbetween premises and conclusion is a tentative one, potentially\ndefeated by additional information. Philosophers have studied the\nnature of defeasible reasoning since Aristotle\u2019s analysis of\ndialectical reasoning in the Topics and the\nPosterior Analytics, but the subject has been studied with\nunique intensity over the last forty years, largely due to the\ninterest it attracted from the artificial intelligence movement in\ncomputer science. There have been two approaches to the study of\nreasoning: treating it either as a branch of epistemology (the study\nof knowledge) or as a branch of logic. In recent work, the term\ndefeasible reasoning has typically been limited to inferences\ninvolving rough-and-ready, exception-permitting generalizations, that\nis, inferring what has or will happen on the basis of what\nnormally happens. This narrower sense of defeasible\nreasoning, which will be the subject of this article, excludes\nfrom the topic the study of other forms of non-deductive reasoning,\nincluding inference to the best explanation, abduction, analogical\nreasoning, and scientific induction. This exclusion is to some extent\nartificial, but it reflects the fact that the formal study of these\nother forms of non-deductive reasoning remains quite rudimentary. \n",
