    "main_text": "French Feminism || The Impasse of Feminine Subjectivity\n4.1 The Impasse of Feminine Subjectivity\n\nIrigaray characterizes her own project as taking place in three\nstages: first, deconstructing the masculine subject; second, figuring\nthe possibility for a feminine subject; and third, construing an\nintersubjectivity that respects sexual difference (Irigaray 1995a:\n96). Sexual difference, in her view, is not a system of domination to\nbe overcome but a cultural process and practice to be achieved and\nnourished; the actual relations of domination and subordination that\ncharacterize Western politics, society, history, literature, language,\nand law, epitomize for Irigaray the reign of sexual\nindifference, the fraternal order of equal brothers/citizens that\nis inattentive to the self-division of nature, its immanent sexual\ndifferentiation. Irigaray\u2019s writings implicate Freud in this\nculture of sexual indifference, his work a symptom of masculine\nmetaphysics and its dream of self-identity and self-mastery. I will\ndiscuss Irigaray\u2019s understanding of sexual indifference further\nbelow, after first describing and elucidating her style of\nwriting.\n\nIrigaray\u2019s writing style is often mimetic, an approach that she\nclaims has been \u201chistorically assigned to the feminine\u201d\n(Irigaray 1977 [1985b: 76]) and therefore that she adopts deliberately\nin order to \u201ctry to recover the place of her exploitation by\ndiscourse\u201d (1977 [1985b: 76]). Irigaray\u2019s writing does not\nproceed propositionally, laying down theses and supporting arguments,\nnor is it formulated through conventionally linear explanations. This\nis not to say, of course, that she does not draw conclusions or that\nher writing is empty of insight. But these insights are reached by\nmirroring the text she is reading, allowing it to play out its\ntensions and contradictions, juxtaposing, transfiguring, and\nintensifying its crises and putting its parapraxes (its textual and\nconceptual slips of the tongue) on display. Her writing is driven by\nthe vagaries of the author before her, and makes appear, or unmasks,\nthe structuring forces of the text and its impasses and limits. This\nreading strategy goes to work on the unconscious logic of a text,\nrevealing the author\u2019s underlying fantasies and anxieties by\namplifying and reflecting them, and thereby attempting to loosen the\nmasculine hold on the symbolic by conveying its unstated postulates\nand conversing from a different perspective. Intently attentive to the\nsignifer, to the words and silences of psychoanalytic texts, she aims\nto retrieve the bodily in language, something underlying symbolic\nprocesses of representation, and to invent a new language and imagine\nnew forms.\n\nSpeculum of the Other Woman (her dissertation and the work\nthat got her exiled from the Lacanian school) includes \u201cThe\nBlind Spot of an Old Dream of Symmetry,\u201d Irigaray\u2019s long\nessay on Freud\u2019s writings on femininity. Irigaray\u2019s essay\non Freud begins by tackling head-on his articulation of the riddle of\nfemininity (Irigaray 1974 [1985a: 13]) in his lecture on\n\u201cFemininity.\u201d Here already we can recognize both\nIrigaray\u2019s unique style and her critical project, and the way\nthese two features of her writing are imbricated and entangled with\none another, propelling a distinctively mimetic method of reading,\nrepeating, and reproducing the text, mirroring Freud\u2019s\nspeculative discourse but also transforming and sabotaging its terms.\nHer text opens as Freud\u2019s does, with his words, and is comprised\nof long quotations that follow the course of Freud\u2019s essay.\nInsofar as this appropriation might at first appear as the passive\nlistening of a dutiful daughter, Irigaray performs a kind of\nmasquerade of femininity: receptive, submissive, obedient. But this\nperformance does not merely reiterate or reproduce; in exemplifying\nthe ways in which women have no language of their own, can only speak\nin or through the voice of the father, she is establishing the\nsymbolic terrain upon which any critique must move while also\nsubverting its presuppositions. Her own words are inserted as\ncommentary, question, counterpoint, breaking open the Freudian text,\nusurping its privileges, revealing its wounds. By engaging Freud in a\nconversation, she insists on her own status as a speaking subject, and\nnot merely an object of study in support of the expansion of a\nsexist science.\n\nIrigaray\u2019s insistence on her own speech is especially crucial\ngiven Freud\u2019s reprimand to women: \u201cyou are yourselves the\nproblem\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968: 113]). Freud\u2019s lecture had\nventured to address the question of sexual difference, and had\nendeavored to complicate rather than simplify our perceptions and\ncertainties concerning its meaning and status. Irigaray, however, by\nretrieving and replaying Freud\u2019s voice, attempts to show that he\nremains caught up in certainties and dogmatisms about sex, so that\nultimately his discourse is one of sexual indifference, as I\nwill discuss next. Freud is thus not the master of Irigaray\u2019s\nessay: his words do not so much determine her trajectory as reveal\ntheir own (freely) associative character, his own unmastery, the egoic\nand identificatory fantasies that haunt his texts on femininity.\n\nAccording to Irigaray, Freud\u2019s work is sexually indifferent\nbecause of its assumption of a kind of symmetry or harmony between\nmasculine and feminine identities and sexualities. With regard to\nsexual desire, Freud assumes that \u2018normal\u2019 women will\ndesire men and be desired by them and thus that each sex can fulfill\nthe longings of the other. With regard to sexual identity, Freud\nmodels the feminine Oedipal Complex on a masculine paradigm and\norigin, with the feminine as its distorted copy. In both cases, Freud\ncontrives to understand women as the complementary other to men, an\nother modeled on the same. Irigaray considers this to be a monosexual,\nhomosocial economy governed by specular opposition or mirroring. It is\nthis sexual indifference that is referenced in the title of\nIrigaray\u2019s essay as \u201cthe old dream of symmetry.\u201d\nBut, as also indicated by her title, Irigaray believes this dream is\npremised on a \u201cblindspot.\u201d Freud characterizes the\ngirl\u2019s relation to the maternal figure as an \u201cespecially\ninexorable repression\u201d (Freud 1931 [1968: 226]) and views the\nlittle girl as a little man; the mother/daughter relation is not seen\nor apprehended by him. The crime here, in Irigaray\u2019s view, is\nmatricide and the suppression of maternal genealogies or lines of\ndescent. The law of the father, the patrimonial order by which sons\ninherit the father\u2019s name by submitting to his prohibitions,\nprivileging this name over the maternal body, appropriates even birth\nto the father. The maternal lineage is suppressed. Irigaray argues\nthat this means that a pre-Oedipal mother-daughter relationship has\nnot been taken up by the signifying order; in fact that order\nretroactively denies that such a relation ever existed, since a\ndaughter becomes a daughter properly, becomes feminized or sexually\ndifferentiated (as a girl or woman), only post-Oedipally. In Lacanian\nterms, Freud excludes the mother/daughter relation from the symbolic\norder. Not only is the maternal connection lost or repressed, but the\nability to name or identify the loss as a loss is also barred.\nBanished from memory, the loss of the mother cannot be mourned.\nIrigaray claims that it is this genealogical asymmetry, with the\nfather\u2019s name memorialized and the mother\u2019s body\nsacrificed to it, that sustains the legitimacy of patriarchy and\npropels the fantasy of a harmony of sexual difference, the conviction\nthat the sexes are reciprocal and complementary in their identities\nand desires.\n\nSexual difference, in Irigaray\u2019s reading of Freud, is thus\nsubsumed under or derived from \u201cthe problematics of\nsameness\u201d (Irigaray 1974 [1985a: 26]) and oriented by the\nfantasy of auto-genesis, being one\u2019s own origin, an ideal of\nself-mastery that is not threatened by any real difference.\nFreud\u2019s account of sexuality presupposes that the sexual subject\nis male, and even that there are no women, only mothers or those\ndestined to become mothers, that is that the meaning of being a woman\nis fully exhausted in the meaning of being a mother. In the psychical\npre-history of the little girl as elaborated in the idea that\n\u201cthe little girl is a little man\u201d (Freud 1933 [1968:\n118]), she will not have been a daughter. As little girls diverge from\nlittle boys, as they cease to be little men, they are expected to be\nappealing visual objects, the mirror of men\u2019s desires, enabling\nmen to represent themselves, shore up their self-image with an adoring\nreflection. Irigaray sees in this account a masculine desire for\nwomen\u2019s desire to be directed toward men. Women are expected to\nprovide the mirror that supports men\u2019s projects, nurtures and\nnourishes their identities, energizes their drive for mastery, by\npresenting themselves as an alter ego. This imaginary, specular, order\nis matricidal, feeding on the blood of women, leaving unpaid its\nfundamental debt to the mother, and abandoning the subjectivity of the\ndaughter. By repressing dependence on the maternal origin of life, the\nmasculine is marked as originary, that from which differentiation\nproceeds. What functions as a primal loss for boys/sons, the cause of\ntheir desire, can only function as a gap in language, an absence of\nmeaning for girls/daughters, an exile from desire, language, and other\nwomen, an irretrievable void that cannot be recuperated in language\nbecause it is instigated by language, by the entry into symbolic order\ncalled forth by the paternal prohibition of the father\u2019s\nno/name. Irigaray\u2019s concern is that for Freud, the mother is\nonly a mirror and her relationship is always to a son; there are no\nmother/daughter relations. Not only is Western culture premised on\nmatricide, which she claims is more primordial than the patricide of\nTotem and Taboo, but this matricide is forgotten and the\nmother remains unmourned.\n\nRepressing any maternal genealogy, political life has been predicated\non the lineage between fathers and sons and the bonds of brotherhood,\nappropriating universality and citizenship to men and rendering women\nas objects of their desire and exchange. The exploitation of women is\nnot merely a phenomenon that takes place within the social order, it\nis its very foundation and premise. Irigaray calls the fraternal order\n\u201chom(m)osexuality,\u201d meaning both that it is an order of\nthe same (homo) and that it is the order of men (homme): the regime of\nsexual indifference ignores relations among women, and especially\nbetween mothers and daughters, and situates women as the medium of\nmen\u2019s alliances with one another, as the buried support and\nenergetic reserves of the body politic. This forgetting of the mother\nsupports vertical and horizontal relations between men but leaves\nwomen unrepresented in language (as subjects) and incapable of\nachieving representation in the body politic (as citizens).\nIrigaray\u2019s own project thus aims to criticize the hom(m)osexual\norder and its specular economy, to reinvigorate mother/daughter\nrelations to make possible a feminine subjectivity, and to cultivate\nsexual difference in the political realm, in civil identity.\nDeveloping the resources for transformation, i.e., for women to become\ncitizens and subjects, entails disrupting the transmission of power\nbetween men and rethinking the passage from nature to culture\nrepresented by the Oedipal Complex. This task requires intervening in\nthe symbolic and imaginary realms, creating a new language that would\nnot be severed from the body and ending the division of labor between\nlove and law.\n\nThe structure of the representational economy, its association of\nsubjectivity with masculinity, precludes the convergence of being a\nwoman and being a speaking being. Although of course there are words\nfor women, these words constitute her only with reference to\nmasculinity, as a photographic negative of man, or in response to a\npatriarchal exertion of feminine norms and expectations. They secure\nher in a masculine universe, they say in advance what she is, they\nrender her captive to an idea of feminine essence. By contrast,\nIrigaray seeks to create a representation for women that would not be\na designation of what she is, defining her by and holding her to some\nconcrete essence, but would allow her to exist on her own terms and\nspeak for herself. Irigaray believes that this type of\nself-determination is barred by the exclusion of mother-daughter\ngenealogies, an exclusion that works to assign woman to a maternal\ndestiny (as mothers of men). Neither denotative nor expressive,\nneither speaking of woman (as though woman were a determinate object\nof study) nor speaking as one (as though the aim were to express an\ninner essence), Irigaray\u2019s writing establishes a reflexive\nrelation to language. By acquiescing, in her mimetic writing style, to\nthe cultural expectation of feminine artifice, Irigaray stages her own\nexiled agency and thereby extends the possibilities for being a woman\nto include being not only an object in or reference of language but a\ntransformer of language. Without claiming to say what a woman really\nis, to get right what the symbolic order gets wrong, she shows that in\nspeaking differently, the very meaning of being a woman (or being a\nman) can be transformed, so that sexual difference remains open to new\npossibilities. She thus does not so much refute Freud\u2019s account\nof the Oedipal Complex and the little girl\u2019s purported\nmasculinity as re-present its primal crime against women, the Oedipal\nexclusion of maternal dependency, thereby altering the scene of its\nrepresentation.\n\nIrigaray also challenges the Lacanian idea of the law of the father\nand the phallic signifier, pillorying the way in which natural birth\nhas been assigned to maternity while cultural birth is assigned to\npaternity, equating the woman-mother with body and the man-father with\nlanguage and law, and relegating the bodily process of parturition\n(maternity) to mute nature while valorizing the symbolic process of\nlegitimation (paternity) as constitutive of civilization. Human\nsubjectivity has been masculinized, while human flesh is both\nfeminized and animalized. Irigaray aims to provoke a legitimation\ncrisis in the paternal legacy and the name of the father that bestows\non the child a political and familial identity.\n\nThe erasure of sexual difference enables a metaphysics of substance in\nwhich sexual identity is a matter of fixed and pre-determined being,\nof underlying essences or common properties, rather than a form of\nbecoming and self-generation. Irigaray\u2019s genealogical account of\nsexual difference resists both the idea of an invariant universal (and\nhence sexually neutral) human essence that subtends (and thereby\nexpels) human multiplicity and the idea of sexual essences that\nconsist in self-enclosed identities between which there is an\nuncrossable divide. That is, she rejects the ontological assumptions\nof both universal equality and separatism, taking both to be\nimplicitly masculine and patriarchal, bound to a metaphysical\nessentialism that aims to capture diversity in first or final\nprinciples, or to subsume particulars under general concepts.\nChallenging the logic of the one and the many, Irigaray takes the\nself-division of nature, its being-two, as a model of autonomous\nself-development. When Irigaray says that human nature is two, she\ndoes not mean that there are two fixed sexual substances, but that to\nbe natural is to be embodied, finite, divided, that the fundamental\ncharacter of nature is growth through differentiation. Human nature,\nin her view, is not disembodied or neutral; it is always distinctively\nsexed or sexuate, a neologism for sexed, but not necessarily erotic,\nbodily difference. Viewing the natural body as self-differentiating\nrather than self-identical, Irigaray also articulates distinctive\ncapacities for generation corresponding to differing morphological\npossibilities (the possibilities of bodily form) that entail\n\u201cdifferent subjective configurations\u201d (Irigaray 1994\n[2001: 137]).\n\nIf human nature is two, and always divided, Irigaray argues, then\ncivil identity is also two and divided; the two of nature needs to be\nbrought into the two of culture. The one is an illusion of patriarchy,\nwhile the two threatens the phallocentric order and challenges the\nsupposition that universality must be singular. The scandalous idea of\na feminine subjectivity means that the universal must be doubled.\nDoubling the universal does not, for Irigaray, mean merely replacing a\nneutral universality (something that holds true for all human beings)\nwith two wholly distinct and separate truths. A universal that has\nbeen doubled has also been split or divided from itself, no longer\none, and Irigaray sees in this the possibility for cultivating sexual\ndifference and overcoming a culture of sexual indifference that is\ndependent on the idea of the generic human.\n\nIf the other has always been formulated on the basis of the same, as\nmerely a specific difference from some underlying generic identity,\nthere has only been complementarity and opposition, there has never\nbeen an actual other subject, each with its own path of development.\nWomen have mirrored men\u2019s subjectivities, reflected their egos\nback to them in an illusion of wholeness and unity, submitted to the\ndemand that they perform or masquerade femininity. Given this\ncriticism of the exploitation of otherness, and despite her criticism\nof a feminist politics of equality, Irigaray thus cannot be\nsimplistically aligned with the project of difference, if this means\nasserting features of women\u2019s biological or social specificity\nas essential and innately valuable attributes, since these Irigaray\ntakes to be framed already and in advance by a patriarchal symbolic\nand imaginary order. Irigaray\u2019s affirmation of sexual difference\ndoes not mean affirming the feminine traits that have been ascribed to\nwomen, since these are actually, in her view, the traits of sexual\nindifference, defined only with reference to men. Sexual difference\nhas yet to appear and it is her task to bring it into being.\n\nBeing-two is counterposed to the metaphysical alteration between the\none and the many, with its incessant oscillation between the\nessentialism of a rigid identity and the laissez-faire contingency,\nindependent of any determining essence, of unlimited multiplicity and\natomistic individualism. It is on the basis of this being-two that\nIrigaray attempts to build an ethics of sexual difference, a political\nrelation between-two, with civil rights appropriate to sexuate\nidentity, so that one\u2019s identity as a citizen is not cut off\nfrom the body, and law is not severed from nature. If sexual\ndifference is not simply an effect of oppression, then freedom does\nnot mean freedom from sexed embodiment. While political neutrality can\nonly recognize disembodied subjects deprived of their bodily life, for\nIrigaray, citizens are not abstractions. The doubled, non-neutral,\nuniversal allows for distinctively feminine (and distinctively\nmasculine) subjects to be recognized politically.\n\nSimilarly to Beauvoir, who ascertains that language and culture\nconstitute the subject as masculine, and the feminine as other to him,\nIrigaray maintains that inhabiting a feminine subjectivity is\nparadoxical in a fraternal social order. But, for Irigaray, both\nBeauvoir and Freud fail to address sexual difference insofar as they\nretain a singular notion of masculine subjectivity, Freud because he\npresumes the libido is always masculine, and Beauvoir because she\nreckons the aim of women\u2019s emancipation as equality with men\n(for instance by concluding the Second Sex with a call to\nbrotherhood and seeming, arguably, to be calling for women to\nassimilate to masculine norms of selfhood). Irigaray rejects the\nproject of equality, since \u2018equality\u2019 can only ever mean\nequality to men, and proposes instead doubling the notion of\nsubjectivity in line with the subject\u2019s own self-division. This\nmight seem unnecessary, especially to equality-oriented feminists,\nsince of course, women can, at least in much of the liberal,\ndemocratic world, be citizen-subjects, just like men. But\nIrigaray\u2019s point is that women can have the rights of men only\nso long as they are like men, i.e., insofar as they are brothers,\nsubsumed into the neutral individuality of the liberal social\ncontract. This purportedly equal access to citizenship and\nsubjectivity thus does not resolve the paradox, since it merely takes\nthe side of subjectivity over that of femininity, retaining the\nconstitution of the feminine as lack, the inverted image of man, the\nother of the same, that which stands in the way of political agency\nand obstructs autonomy, and which thus must be overcome in order to\nachieve self-determination. In the prevailing social contract,\nfemininity and subjectivity remain opposed.\n\nIrigaray does not think she can say what a woman is or what femininity\nis. Familial, social, and symbolic mechanisms of exchange have denied\nfemininity its own images and language, fashioning women through\nmen\u2019s language, images, and desires, and thereby producing an\napparent, but false, symmetry within a single, monotonous, language.\nAgainst this homogeny, with its same and its other, Irigaray construes\nthe production or work of sexual difference, sexual difference as a\nrelation between-two, to be the path toward liberating both femininity\nand masculinity from their metaphysical and political constraints by\nallowing them each to cultivate their own interdependent natures. The\nidea of a between-two does not mean a singular path that is shared by\nboth, but rather indicates, in addition to the value of a specifically\nfeminine sexual identity and a specifically masculine sexual identity,\nthe ethical path of an intersubjective relationality that allows them\nto appreciate and value one another. Since the between-two is premised\non being-two (self-differentiated), it is in the cultivation of this\nsexual difference that we will find the possibility of an ethical\nsexual relation, what Irigaray calls an ethics of sexual difference.\nFor Irigaray, then, contra Lacan, there can be a sexual relation.\nIrigaray\u2019s undertaking thus involves not merely an assertion of\ndifference against equality, nor certainly a simple reversal; such\nstances take place on the basis of an already existing symbolic order\nand imaginary relation and are themselves what need to be\ninterrogated. To find a language for feminine sexuality and feminine\nsubjectivity, we must go \u201cback through the dominant\ndiscourse\u201d (Irigaray 1977 [1985b: 119]) with its metaphysical\nassumptions of substance or essence, and its concept of identity which\nadheres to the regime of sexual indifference.\n\nAlthough Irigaray often invokes the maternal as the source of life and\nsubjectivity, she does not equate maternity with femininity or the\nmother with the woman. Among many others, Jessica Benjamin (whose work\nwill be discussed below) seems to share the mistaken view that\nIrigaray\u2019s theoretical project is premised upon valorizing\n\u201cfemale genitals as a starting point for a different\ndesire\u201d (Benjamin 1988: 276). No doubt this (mis)interpretation\nstems from Irigaray\u2019s\u00a0text \u201cWhen Our Lips Speak\nTogether.\u201d But what Irigaray means by \u2018speaking from the\nbody\u2019 is moving away from a singular conception of origin and\ndesire, and most especially the origin of desire. Her writing of\nwomen\u2019s bodies, like her retrieval of mother/daughter\ngenealogies is a strategy of language and imagination, situating the\nbody as fluid border, the site of the overflow of culture into nature\nand vice versa, rather than a self-enclosed egoic center. She is not\nan essentialist who views women\u2019s biology as their destiny.\nInstead she challenges the nature/culture divide, and the either/or of\nbiology or civilization.\n",
