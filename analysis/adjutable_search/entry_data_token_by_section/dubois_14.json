Intellectual History, History of Philosophy, and Du Bois\n\nWe conclude this entry by noting that an ongoing feature of scholarly\ndebate about Du Bois is sometimes contentious disagreement as to his\nproper place in intellectual history and/or the history of philosophy.\nA brief survey of the variety of interpretive orientations that\nusefully have been brought to bear in appraising Du Bois as a\nphilosopher, or as a thinker, suggests that, in studying his writings,\nwe might do well to heed Nietzsche\u2019s suggestion that the\nmultiplication of perspectives can often enhance our knowledge of the\nsubject matter under consideration (Nietzsche, 1887, 85).\n\nThe relevant categories tend to be geographic, racial, thematic, or\nsome combination of the three. Du Bois\u2019s philosophical books and\nessays have been read as contributions to American thought (Zamir,\n1995) and to American political thought (Reed, 1997). More narrowly\nand more broadly, they have been read as statements of\nAfro-American exceptionalist thought (West, 1982); as key constituents\nof the black nationalist tradition (Moses, 1978); as important\nadditions to the black natural law tradition (Lloyd, 2016); as a part\nof the history of African American prophetic political critique\n(Marshall, 2011); and as critical contributions to Africana and\nAfro-Modern thought (Gordon, 2008; Gooding-Williams, 2009). Intending\nto correct the tendency evident in these works to position Du Bois as\nan American, black American, Africana, and/or Afro-modern thinker,\nAppiah (2014) has highlighted the late 19th century, German\nintellectual milieu that shaped Du Bois\u2019s thinking. Contra\nAppiah, Tommy Curry (2014) has argued that we lose sight of the\nphilosophical substance of Du Bois\u2019s thought if, like Appiah, we\nscant the influence of other African American writers on his\nthinking.\n\nAmong critics wishing to situate Du Bois within a well-defined,\nwestern philosophical tradition, the main tendencies have been to\ncharacterize Du Bois either as a pragmatist (see West, 1989, Taylor,\n2004b, and Kahn, 2009) or as an Hegelian of sorts. Much of the\nliterature following this second line of interpretation has considered\nDu Bois\u2019s writings, and especially Souls, in the\nperspective of Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology of Spirit (see,\ne.g., Gooding-Williams, 1987 and 1991; Zamir, 1995; and, most\nrecently, Shaw, 2013). In this connection, Paul Taylor (2004b) has\npersuasively argued that we need not choose between an Hegelian Du\nBois and a pragmatist Du Bois. More recently, Nahum Chandler has\nproposed to read Du Bois neither as an Hegelian, nor as a pragmatist,\nbut in parallel to several of his European contemporaries, including\nHusserl, Weber, Durkheim, Boas and Freud (Chandler, 2014).\n\nTo be sure, it would be false to claim that all of the above-mentioned\ninterpretive perspectives have yielded genuine insight and\nillumination. But more have than have not, a fact that primarily\nattests to the range, depth, and fecundity of Du Bois\u2019s\nphilosophical thought.\n",
