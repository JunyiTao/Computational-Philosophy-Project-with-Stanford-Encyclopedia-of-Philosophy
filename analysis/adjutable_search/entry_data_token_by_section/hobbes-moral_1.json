    "main_text": "The Philosophical Project\n2. The Philosophical Project\n\nHobbes sought to discover rational principles for the construction of\na civil polity that would not be subject to destruction from within.\nHaving lived through the period of political disintegration\nculminating in the English Civil War, he came to the view that the\nburdens of even the most oppressive government are \u201cscarce\nsensible, in respect of the miseries, and horrible calamities, that\naccompany a Civill Warre\u201d. Because virtually any government\nwould be better than a civil war, and, according to Hobbes\u2019s\nanalysis, all but absolute governments are systematically prone to\ndissolution into civil war, people ought to submit themselves to an\nabsolute political authority. Continued stability will require that\nthey also refrain from the sorts of actions that might undermine such\na regime. For example, subjects should not dispute the sovereign power\nand under no circumstances should they rebel. In general, Hobbes aimed\nto demonstrate the reciprocal relationship between political obedience\nand peace.\n",
