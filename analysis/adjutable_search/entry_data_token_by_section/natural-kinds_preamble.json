    "main_text": "\n\nScientific disciplines frequently divide the particulars they study\ninto kinds and theorize about those kinds. To say that a kind\nis natural is to say that it corresponds to a grouping that\nreflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests\nand actions of human beings. We tend to assume that science is often\nsuccessful in revealing these kinds; it is a corollary of scientific\nrealism that when all goes well the classifications and taxonomies\nemployed by science correspond to the real kinds in nature. The\nexistence of these real and independent kinds of things is held to\njustify our scientific inferences and practices.\n\nPutative examples of kinds may be found in all scientific disciplines.\nChemistry provides what are taken by many to be the paradigm examples\nof kinds, the chemical elements, while chemical compounds, such as\nH2O, are also natural kinds of stuff. (Instances of a\nnatural kind may be man-made, such as artificially synthesized\nascorbic acid, i.e., vitamin C; but whether chemical kinds all of\nwhose instances are artificial are natural kinds is open to debate.\nThe synthetic transuranium elements, e.g. Rutherfordium, seem good\ncandidates for natural kinds, whereas artificial chemical kinds, such\nas the entirely synthetic compound bismuth germanate,\nBi4Ge3OO12, which is used in particle\ndetectors, are, arguably, less obviously natural kinds.) The standard\nmodel in quantum physics reveals many kinds of fundamental particles\n(electron, tau neutrino, charm quark), plus broader categories such as\nkinds of kind (lepton, quark) and higher kinds (fermion, boson).\nAstronomy classifies the heavenly bodies: galaxies, for example, can\nbe either elliptical, lenticular, or spiral.\n\nSince kinds are revealed by science, a science can revise which kinds\nit holds exist: phlogisticated air was regarded as a kind until after\nLavoisier\u2019s chemical revolution. A science can even question a\nwhole category of kinds, or sort and classify kinds differently as the\nscience changes and new knowlege is gained. Before being superseded in\nthis regard by the chemical elements, biological species were taken to\nbe the best exemplars of kindhood. Yet now it is somewhat\ncontroversial to state that species are natural kinds. As the world\nchanges, its kinds may change too. Rapidly mutating micro-organisms\ndemand new classification systems. Kinds in the social sciences, such\nas economics or sociology, are even more problematic, since the\nchanging norms and practices of individuals and societies may also be\nheld to be constitutive factors in kind membership, and these norms\nand practices may themselves respond to our classification of people\ninto kinds. These examples are troublesome because there is some\ntension between the existence of kinds and the mutability of the\nparticulars which are supposed to fall under those kinds. In the case\nof atoms or galaxies, the particulars under study are typically\nlong-lived and only slowly changing; viruses and economic structures,\non the other hand, are more dynamic.\n\nThis article divides philosophical discussions of natural kinds into\nfour areas: metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of science, and\nphilosophy of language. The metaphysics of natural kinds asks whether\nwe should think of our supposed natural kinds as genuinely natural.\nAnd if they are, what are natural kinds? And, finally, do\nnatural kinds have essences? Philosophy of science is concerned with\nnatural kinds because, as mentioned above, it is the use of natural\nkinds by the individual (\u2018special\u2019) sciences that\ngenerates our interest in them. So we may ask, whether the kinds\nappearing in our best scientific theories do indeed satisfy the\ntheories of natural kinds proposed by the metaphysicians. Philosophy\nof language takes an interest in natural kinds because basic issues\nare raised by the semantics of natural kind terms. For example, if we\nthink of naming an entity and describing it as, semantically speaking,\nfundamentally different ways of talking about it, should we think of\nnatural kind terms as functioning like names or like descriptions?\n",
