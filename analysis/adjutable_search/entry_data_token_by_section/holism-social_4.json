The argument rests on\nthe view that holist explanations draw on social theories, whereas\nindividualist explanations involve individualist theories. From within\nthis context, it is argued that social theories are oftentimes\nirreducible to, and hence irreplaceable by, individualist theories.\nAccordingly, when holist explanations make use of irreducible social\ntheories, they cannot be substituted by individualist explanations\nthat appeal to individualist theories. Since the events that are\nexplained by appeal to irreducible social theories should not go\nunexplained, holist explanations are therefore indispensable.\n\nTypically, discussions of the argument rely on some version of the\nNagelian model of intertheoretic reduction. The model conceives of\ntheories as statements issued mainly in the form of laws. Adapted to\nthe present focus, it requires that two conditions be fulfilled in\norder to reduce a social theory to an individualist one. The first\nrequirement is the condition of connectability, which must be met\nbecause it is assumed that holist theories are distinguished by their\nuse of social predicates or descriptions, whereas individualist\ntheories are characterized by containing individualist predicates or\ndescriptions only. Following one common interpretation, the condition\nstates that the social predicates in the social theory to-be-reduced\nmust be linked, on a one-to-one basis, to individualist descriptions\nin the reducing individualist theory. The resulting bridge laws, as\nthey are called, express that the linked descriptions are\nco-extensive, that is, that they have the same reference, in a\nlaw-like manner. (Note that this is a weaker condition than the demand\nconsidered in\n 2.2,\n requiring that the meaning of social terms must be captured by\nspecifications that contain descriptions of individuals only.) The\ncondition of connectability implies that if, say, the social term\n\u201cchurch\u201d occurs in the social theory to-be-reduced, then\nit must be demonstrated that this term is co-extensive, in a law-like\nmanner, with a single individualist description of individuals and\ntheir properties as realizing a church. Once this condition has been\nmet, the second requirement, the condition of derivability, should be\nfulfilled. It states that the social theory to-be-reduced must be\ndeduced from, and in that sense explained by, the reducing\nindividualist theory, plus the bridge laws.\n\nModerate methodological holists have primarily focused on\ndemonstrating that social theories cannot be reduced to individualist\ntheories because of difficulties that relate to meeting the\nrequirement of connectability. The most prominent argument to this\neffect is the argument from multiple realization (other arguments\ninclude, e.g., Kincaid 1996, Wahlberg 2019). The argument from\nmultiple realization originates from within philosophy of mind, from\nwhence it was developed into a generalizable argument against\nintertheoretic reduction (see Putnam 1967 and Fodor 1974). In the\n1980s, it began to appear as an argument against the possibility of\nreducing social to individualist theories (see e.g., Kincaid 1986,\n1996, 1997; Little 1991; Rios 2005; Sawyer 2002, 2005, Wright et al.\n1992; Tollefsen 2002, 2015).\n\nThe argument begins by noting that social properties supervene on, or\nare realized by, individualist properties. It is then pointed out that\nthis relationship between social and individualist properties is\ncompatible with social properties being realizable not only by a\nsingle compound of individualist properties, but by different\u2014in\nfact indefinitely many\u2014compounds of individualist properties. An\nempirical claim is made next, asserting that many social properties\nare indeed multiply realizable. This point is typically supported by\nway of example. For instance, Kincaid lists several social predicates\nsuch as \u201crevolution\u201d, \u201cbureaucracy\u201d, and\n\u201cpeer group\u201d, and remarks that \u201cany number of\ndifferent relations between individuals, individual psychological\nstates, beliefs, etc. could realize the referent of these terms\u201d\n(Kincaid 1986: 497). In a similar vein, Keith Sawyer states that\n\u201c\u2018being a church\u2019 could be realized in disjunctive\n[and hence multiple] ways in different cultures and social\ngroups\u201d (Sawyer 2002: 550). Finally, it is observed that the\ncondition of connectability cannot be met whenever social theories\ncontain social predicates that refer to social properties that have\nmultiple and highly different, or indefinitely many, realizations. In\nthese cases, the social predicates cannot be linked via bridge laws to\nsingle individualist descriptions. Instead, they will have to be\nlinked to a disjunction of individualist descriptions. To see this,\nreturn to the example of the social property of being a church.\nInsofar as a church is multiply realizable, the term\n\u201cchurch\u201d will have to be linked up with a disjunction of\nindividualist descriptions, each characterizing a possible compound of\nindividualist properties that may realize a church. The upshot is that\nsocial theories that refer to multiply realizable social properties\ncannot be reduced to individualist theories. Thus, holist explanations\nthat appeal to these theories cannot be substituted by individualist\nexplanations.\n\nWithin recent discussions in the philosophy of science, the Nagelian\nmodel of intertheoretic reduction has been criticized on a number of\ngrounds that likewise challenge its suitability as a model of\nreduction in the context of the dispensability debate. Insofar as the\nmodel is deemed inadequate, arguments in favor of the indispensability\nof holist explanations that rest on this model lose their\nsignificance.\n",
