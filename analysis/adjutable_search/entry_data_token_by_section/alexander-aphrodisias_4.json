    "main_text": "Alexander as philosopher\n4. Importance and Influence\n\nThere is no information concerning the impact of Alexander\u2019s teaching\nin his lifetime. But certain indications of critical attacks on his\ncontemporary Galen (129\u2013216 CE) suggest that he was engaged in\ncontroversy with other contemporaries as well. Whether his polemics\nagainst contemporary versions of Stoic doctrine were part of a\npersonal exchange or rather a bookish exercise is unclear. If\nAlexander held the chair of Peripatetic philosophy at Athens it is\nquite possible that he was in direct contact with the incumbents of\nthe other philosophical chairs there. He was, of course, not the first\ncommentator on Aristotle. But posterior exegetes certainly treated as\nexemplary his method and his standards for explaining problems and\nobscurities in Aristotle\u2019s texts. This is indicated both by explicit\nreferences in later commentators and by the unacknowledged\nexploitation of his work in some extant later commentaries on the same\ntexts. As the translations of his work into Arabic and, to a lesser\ndegree, into Latin show, he continued to be treated as a leading\nauthority and his work influenced the Aristotelian tradition\nthroughout late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and in the Renaissance.\nScholars nowadays continue to make use of his commentaries, not only\nfor historical reasons but also because his suggestions are often\nworth considering in their own right. Because in recent years much\nmore attention has been paid to the philosophers in late antiquity,\nnot only to the Neo-Platonists, Alexander\u2019s work has come under\ndetailed scrutiny in various respects by specialists, as witnessed by\nan increase in publications both on general and on special aspects of\nhis exegetical and philosophical work. The accessibility of most of\nhis writings in English translations will make apparent to a more\ngeneral readership that Alexander\u2019s work is not only relevant for\nspecialists in the history of philosophy, but opens up an interesting\nage of transition in the history of philosophical and scientific\nideas.\n",
