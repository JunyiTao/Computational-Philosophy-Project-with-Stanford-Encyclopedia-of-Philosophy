    "main_text": "Logic and Semantics || Signification, Connotation, Supposition\n3.2 Signification, Connotation, Supposition\n\nPart I of the Summa of Logic also introduces a number of\nsemantic notions that play an important role throughout much of\nOckham\u2019s philosophy. None of these notions is original with\nOckham, although he develops them with great sophistication and\nemploys them with skill.\n\nThe most basic such notion is \u201csignification.\u201d For the\nMiddle Ages, a term \u201csignifies\u201d what it makes us think\nof. This notion of signification was unanimously accepted;\nalthough there was great dispute over what terms signified,\nthere was agreement over the\n criterion.[15]\n Ockham, unlike many (but no means all) other medieval logicians, held\nthat terms do not in general signify thought, but can signify anything\nat all (including things not presently existing). The function of\nlanguage, therefore, is not so much to communicate thoughts from one\nmind to another, but to convey information about the\n world.[16]\n\nIn Summa of Logic I.33, Ockham acknowledges four different\nkinds of signification. In his first sense, a term signifies whatever\nthings it is truly predicable of by means of a present-tensed,\nassertoric copula. That is, a term t signifies a thing\nx if and only if \u2018This is a t\u2019 is true,\npointing to x. In the second sense, t signifies\nx if and only if \u2018This is (or was, or will be, or can\nbe) a t\u2019 is true, pointing to\n x.[17]\n These first two senses of signification are together called\n\u201cprimary\u201d signification.\n\nIn the third sense, terms can also be said to signify certain things\nthey are not truly predicable of, no matter the tense or\nmodality of the copula. For instance, the word \u2018brave\u2019 not\nonly makes us think of brave people (whether presently existing or\nnot); it also makes us think of the bravery in virtue of\nwhich we call them \u201cbrave.\u201d Thus, \u2018brave\u2019\nsignifies and is truly predicable of brave people, but also signifies\nbravery, even though it is not truly predicable of bravery. (Bravery\nis not brave.) This kind of signification is called\n\u201csecondary\u201d signification.\n To\n a first approximation, we can say that a \u201cconnotative\u201d\nterm is just a term that has a secondary signification, and that such\na connotative term \u201cconnotes\u201d exactly what it secondarily\nsignifies; in short, connotation is just secondary\n signification.[18]\n The fourth sense, finally, is the broadest one: according to it any\nlinguistic unit, including a whole sentence, can be said to signify\nwhatever things it makes us think of in some way or other. A sentence\nsignifies in this sense whatever it is that its terms primarily or\nsecondarily signify.\n\nThe theory of supposition was the centerpiece of late medieval\nsemantic theory. Supposition is not the same as signification. First\nof all, terms signify wherever we encounter them, whereas they have\nsupposition only in the context of a proposition. But the differences\ngo beyond that. Whereas signification is a psychological, cognitive\nrelation, the theory of supposition is, at least in part, a theory of\nreference. For Ockham, there are three main kinds of\n supposition[19]:\n\nPersonal supposition, in which a term supposits for (refers to)\nwhat it signifies (in either of the first two senses of signification\ndescribed above). For example, in \u2018Every dog is a mammal\u2019,\nboth \u2018dog\u2019 and \u2018mammal\u2019 have personal\nsupposition.\nSimple supposition, in which a term supposits for a concept it\ndoes not signify. Thus, in \u2018Dog is a species\u2019 or\n\u2018Dog is a universal\u2019, the subject \u2018dog\u2019 has\nsimple supposition. For Ockham the nominalist, the only real\nuniversals are universal concepts in the mind and, derivatively,\nuniversal spoken or written terms expressing those concepts.\nMaterial supposition, in which a term supposits for a spoken or\nwritten expression it does not signify. Thus, in \u2018Dog has three\nletters\u2019, the subject \u2018dog\u2019 has material\n supposition.[20]\n\n\nPersonal supposition, which was the main focus, was divided into\nvarious subkinds, distinguished in terms of a theory of \u201cdescent\nto singulars\u201d and \u201cascent from singulars.\u201d A quick\nexample will give the flavor: In \u2018Every dog is a mammal\u2019,\n\u2018dog\u2019 is said to have \u201cconfused and\ndistributive\u201d personal supposition insofar as\n\nIt is possible to \u201cdescend to singulars\u201d as follows:\n\u201cEvery dog is a mammal; therefore, Fido is a mammal, and Rover\nis a mammal, and Bowser is a mammal \u2026,\u201d and so on for all\ndogs.\nIt is not possible to \u201cascend from any one\nsingular\u201d as follows: \u201cFido is a mammal; therefore, every\ndog is a mammal.\u201d\n\n\nAlthough the mechanics of this part of supposition theory are well\nunderstood, in Ockham and in other authors, its exact purpose remains\nan open question. Although at first the theory looks like an account\nof truth conditions for quantified propositions, it will not work for\nthat purpose. And although the theory was sometimes used as an aid to\nspotting and analyzing fallacies, this was never done systematically\nand the theory is in any event ill suited for that\n purpose.[21]\n",
