    "main_text": "Mechanism and the Order of Nature\n9. Mechanism and the Order of Nature\n\nKant was perturbed by Hume\u2019s criticisms of causal relations in\nnature, implying that there were no laws of nature for science to rely\non, and by the antitheological application Hume made of his causal\nskepticism in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. [See\nthe entry on\n Kant and Hume on causality.]\n He sought a third way between the Leibnizian \u201cdogmatic\u201d\nassumption that the universe is a single mechanical system of\ndeterministically interacting physical parts, designed and set going\nby God, and the empiricist assumption that causality corresponds to a\nhuman feeling of anticipation with respect to some sequence of ideas.\nFor scientific purposes, Kant thought, we must represent inorganic\nnature to ourselves as just such a unified mechanical system. The\nresolve to represent it as such is facilitated (or perhaps dictated?)\nby our inability to experience a world unstructured by spatial,\ntemporal, and causal relations. If Leibniz erred by ascribing to\nunknown noumena the properties of causal closure belonging to\nphenomena, Hume erred by being unaware of the inbuilt constraints on\nour representational capacity. But must we represent only inorganic\nnature \u2014 stones, stars, nebulae, planets, billiard balls \u2014\nas a set of mechanically interacting mechanical systems, or\nearth\u2019s plants and animals as well? Leibniz was fully committed\nto the Cartesian claim that plants and animals are machines, no\ndifferent in principle from automata built from wood and metal parts;\nthough, impressed by the detail revealed by the early microscope, he\ndescribed them as infinitely complex machines, \u201cmachines in\ntheir smallest parts, into infinity\u201d (G 6: 618), another\nindication of the divine origins of nature. Generation and growth were\non his view, mechanical processes, for, according to the doctrine of\npreformation, which he shared with Malebranche, generation is just\ngrowth.\n\nKant was not so sure. By the late 18th century, the theory\nof inorganic nature, thanks to Laplace, Black, Priestley, Franklin,\nand other chemists and electricians was flourishing, but so too was\nthe study of physiology, embryology, and natural history, thanks\nespecially to Bourguet, Boerhaave, Haller, and Buffon. Newtonian\nforces acting over a distance were no longer seen as incompatible with\na commitment to mechanism, opening the door to the supposition of\nvital forces that might act in a lawlike fashion. Preformation was no\nlonger a credible doctrine; the possibility of self-assembling\n\u201corganic molecules,\u201d working according to \u201corganic\nmechanism,\u201d was much discussed. Epigenesis reduced the need for\na divine creator. Kant addresses the ensuing intellectual-theological\ncrisis in the Critique of Judgment, a two-part essay dealing\nwith beauty, beautiful forms in nature, and forms in nature generally.\nHe tries to show that we are caught up in an antinomy. We are strongly\ndisposed to view visible nature as a unity in which a single set of\nmechanical forces operates, not to divide it into an inorganic realm\nthat came to be by the forces inherent in nature and an organic realm\nof plants and animals evidencing design and supernatural creation. Yet\nwe cannot envision explaining generation or organic growth\nmechanistically. The solution to the dilemma is to adopt teleology as\na regulative principle. We should not positively declare that organic\nbeings could not have arisen and cannot reproduce themselves from the\nforces of nature, or that God must have a hand in their genesis;\nnevertheless, in investigating them, we look for the function and\ninterrelation of parts, as though they were designed and built\nintelligently (5: 416ff). The claim that the parts of a living\ncreature are organized in infinitum as Leibniz supposed is\nhowever, \u201csomething that cannot be thought at all.\u201d (KRV A\n526/B 554).\n\nLeibniz was often mistakenly credited in the 18th century\nwith the view that organic nature contained no gaps, i.e., between any\ntwo different-looking organisms, another can be found. Though such a\nview might seem consistent with Leibniz\u2019s Principle of Plenitude\n\u2014 that the universe is as full as possible \u2014 and his Law\nof Continuity \u2014 his denial that nature makes leaps (GM 6: 240)\n\u2014 it is inconsistent with his view that not everything possible\nexists, but only what is compossible with other existents, and Leibniz\nheld no such view in any case. Kant describes the idea of perfect\ncontinuity in any case as mere intellectual prejudice, since\nobservation of nature does not objectively support it. However, he\nallows the \u201claw of the ladder of continuity among\ncreatures\u201d has regulative importance in natural history (KRV A\n668/ B 696).\n",
