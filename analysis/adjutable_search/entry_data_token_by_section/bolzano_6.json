    "main_text": "Logic || Bolzano\u2019s Analysis of Propositions (i.e., of his \u201cSentences in Themselves\u201d)\n3.4 Bolzano\u2019s Analysis of Propositions (i.e., of his \u201cSentences in Themselves\u201d)\n\nAlthough Bolzano contributed many highly interesting and valuable\ninsights to the analysis of propositions, they all are shaped in the\nsubject-predicate scheme. We must explain some of these insights\nbefore we discuss Bolzano\u2019s main contributions to logic in the\nsections 3.6\u20133.9.\n\nIn what follows brackets will be used for the denotation of\npropositions and ideas. Thus \u2018[Socrates has wisdom]\u2019 will\ndenote the proposition expressed by the words \u2018Socrates has\nwisdom\u2019, and \u2018[Socrates]\u2019 and \u2018[wisdom]\u2019\nwill denote the ideas expressed by the words \u2018Socrates\u2019\nand \u2018wisdom\u2019, respectively. (Such a notation is not\nwithout problems, but this is not the place to discuss them.) Bolzano\nstarts his analysis of propositions by proclaiming the traditional\nsubject-predicate view as a dogma: Despite the variety of their\nlinguistic expressions, all propositions are of the form \\([A\\) has\n\\(b]\\) and therefore have exactly three parts, namely a subject idea\n\\([A]\\), a predicate idea \\([b]\\), and the copula [has], i.e. the idea\nexpressed by the word \u2018has\u2019 or another form of \u2018to\nhave\u2019 (WL II, 9\u201317). Bolzano prefers this copula to the\ncopula expressed by a form of \u2018to be\u2019 for the following\nreason: In everyday language we try to avoid abstracts such as\n\u2018wisdom\u2019 and prefer saying \u2018Socrates is wise\u2019;\nbut in doing so we attribute a property \u2014 namely wisdom \u2014\nto Socrates. The logical structure of the proposition is therefore\nbest displayed \u2014 says Bolzano \u2014 by the words\n\u2018Socrates has wisdom\u2019. Due to the stylistic preference of\nadjectives over abstract nouns, everyday language very often does not\neven provide us with an abstract noun corresponding to an adjective;\nin such cases we therefore use the adjective at hand, although we\ncould always easily introduce a corresponding artificial noun into our\nlanguage.\n\nSince every proposition has the same copula, two propositions can be\ndifferent only if they have either different subject ideas or\ndifferent predicate ideas or both. This results in Bolzano\u2019s\nidentity criterion for propositions: Two propositions \\([A_1\\) has\n\\(b_1]\\) and \\([A_2\\) has \\(b_2]\\) are identical iff (i.e., if and\nonly if) \\([A_1] = [A_2]\\) and \\([b_1] = [b_2]\\). In order for \\([A\\)\nhas \\(b]\\) to be a proposition, it will suffice that the\npredicate idea \\([b]\\) be an arbitrary idea, in a way at least\n\u201cpretending\u201d to be an idea of an attribute (WL II,\n16\u201318). In order for \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) to be true,\nhowever, it is necessary that the predicate idea \\([b]\\) is an idea of\nan attribute (Beschaffenheit). An attribute can be\nan \u201cinner attribute\u201d, i.e., a property\n(Eigenschaft) of an object, or an \u201couter\nattribute\u201d, i.e., a relation (Verh\u00e4ltnis)\namong objects. Examples of properties are wisdom or omnipotence,\nexamples of relations are friendship to so-and-so, fatherhood to\nso-and-so, being twice as long as such-and-such (WL I,\n378\u2013389).\n\nThe main trouble resulting from the traditional subject-predicate view\nin general and from Bolzano\u2019s uniform \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\)\nstructure of every proposition is that under its subject idea \\([A]\\)\ntwo different cases are concealed insofar as it can be singular (as in\nthe case of [God] or [the sun] or [Bernard Bolzano]) or general (as in\nthe case of [man] or [animal] or [planet]). Due to this duality,\nBolzano has to add that \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) or \\([A\\) have \\(b]\\) is to\nbe understood (when \\([A]\\) is general) in the sense of\n[Every \\(A\\) has \\(b]\\) or [All \\(A\\) have \\(b]\\),\ne.g. [Animals have sensitivity] = [Every animal has\nsensitivity] = [All animals have sensitivity] (WL II, 24\nf.).\n\nIn order to confirm his thesis that every proposition has the form\n[(Every) \\(A\\) has \\(b]\\), Bolzano shows of all kinds of verbal forms\nof significant sentences how to transfer them into his standard form\n(cf. WL II, 38 ff. and 211 ff.). Here are some of the rather important\nexamples of Bolzano\u2019s analysis.\n\nPredicate negation (i.e., \u201cinner\u201d negation):\nThe lack of an attribute \\(b\\) (such as the lack of omnipotence) is\nitself a property (WL II, 47) that we can denote by the negation\n\u2018non-\\(b\\)\u2019 (\u2018non-omnipotence\u2019). Negative\npropositions of the form \\([A\\) has non-\\(b]\\), e.g. [Bernard Bolzano\nhas non-omnipotence (i.e., lack of omnipotence)], therefore share the\ngeneral form \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) with all other propositions (WL II,\n44\u201352).\nPropositional negation (i.e., \u201cexternal\u201d\nnegation): From propositions of the form \\([A\\) has non-\\(b]\\) we have\nto distinguish propositions in which another proposition is denied. We\ncan express such propositions by \u2018It is not the case that \\(A\\)\nhas \\(b\\)\u2019. According to Bolzano, such a proposition is about\nanother proposition and states that this proposition is false, i.e.,\nnot true. Its subject idea is therefore an idea of a proposition and\nits predicate idea is the idea of falsity or lack of truth, i.e.,\nnon-truth. Their form is therefore best displayed as [\\([A\\) has\n\\(b]\\) has non-truth] (WL II 62\u201364).\nSubjunctive and disjunctive propositions: The subjunction\nof two propositions \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) is explained by Bolzano as a\nproposition of the form \\([s_2\\) is a consequence of \\(s_1]\\) (WL II,\n198 f., 224\u2013226; Bolzano proposes here also alternative\ninterpretations of \u2018if \u2026 so\u2019 sentences). An\ninclusive or exclusive disjunction of two propositions \\(s_1\\) and\n\\(s_2\\) is interpreted by Bolzano as a proposition which attributes to\nthe idea [a true proposition belonging to the collection consisting of\n\\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2]\\) the property of being non-empty or singular,\nrespectively (WL II, 204 f., 228 f.).\nParticular propositions and there-is propositions: In\nview of Bolzano\u2019s identification of \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) with\n[Every \\(A\\) has \\(b]\\) or [All \\(A\\) have \\(b]\\)\nwhenever \\([A]\\) is general, it is of special interest how he deals\nwith particular propositions expressed by \u2018Some A have\n\\(b\\)\u2019. Bolzano transforms such sentences into there-is\nsentences of the form \u2018There is at least one \\(A\\) that has\n\\(b\\)\u2019. But what about such there-is sentences? In a sentence of\nthe form \u2018There is at least one \\(A\\)\u2019 we attribute,\naccording to Bolzano, not a property to \\(A\\) itself but to the idea\n\\([A]\\), i.e., to the idea of \\(A\\), namely the property of being\nnon-empty. The form of the corresponding propositions is therefore\nbest given as [\\([A]\\) has non-emptiness] (WL II, 52\u201354,\n214\u2013218). This analysis is completely in accordance with\nKant\u2019s \u2014 and of course even more so with Frege\u2019s and\nRussell\u2019s later on \u2014, although Bolzano never stopped\ncriticizing Kant for his dictum that existence is not a real\npredicate. Bolzano took this dictum to be about existence in\nhis own narrow sense of \u2018existence\u2019 or\n\u2018being\u2019, i.e., in the sense of \u2018reality\u2019, and\nnot \u2014 as he should have \u2014 in the broad sense of his\n\u2018es gibt\u2019. His disagreement with Kant on this\npoint is therefore merely verbal in nature. For Bolzano\u2019s\napproach, a true negative existential sentence such as \u2018There is\nno round square\u2019 does not pose a problem any more; the\nproposition expressed by this sentence is [[a round square] has\nemptiness] (WL II, 54 f.).\n\n\nIn his analysis of propositions Bolzano distinguished clearly\ndifferent levels in his realm of propositions and ideas. He even\nintroduced a special name for ideas of ideas, such as the idea of the\nidea \\([A]\\), i.e., [\\([A]\\)]; he called them \u2018symbolic\nideas\u2019 (WL I, 426 ff.). In his efforts to show that all\npropositions can be shaped into \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\), Bolzano makes\nextensive usage of such symbolic ideas (and also of ideas of\npropositions) as subject ideas of propositions, as it is exemplified\nunder ii, iii and iv above. Bolzano took pains to systematize his\nattempts of shaping all propositions into \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\). His\nattempts, however, remained only on the level of examples, since he\nmissed a key for their systematization such as Frege\u2019s\nfunction-argument scheme.\n\nFor Bolzano every proposition is either true or false, and this\nforever \u2014 or better: timelessly. If we get under certain\ncircumstances the impression that one and the same proposition can\nsometimes be true and sometimes be false, this is merely due to the\nfact that we do not talk about a proposition but about an ambiguous\nlinguistic chain of words that expresses two or even more\npropositions, some of which can be true and others false (WL II, 7).\nIf it is the proposition itself, however, of which we get the\nimpression that it can be true as well as false, this is due to the\nfact that we take a part of it to be variable (WL II, 77); in this\ncase again we do not consider a single proposition, but a whole set of\npropositions, i.e., a propositional form. In the expression \u2018It\nis snowing\u2019, e.g., time and place are not determined, and it\ntherefore does not express a proposition, but rather a propositional\nform, indicated by \u2018It is snowing at time \\(t\\) at place\n\\(l\\)\u2019. In order to express a proposition, the variables have to\nbe bound or replaced by constants; Bolzano usually replaces them\n\u2014 for convenience \u2014 by indexicals, e.g., \u2018It is\nsnowing today and here\u2019 (WL I, 113). Even if Bolzano makes\nextensive usage of indexicals in the expression of ideas and\npropositions, there is no place for indexicals within his World 3:\nThere are neither indexical ideas nor indexical propositions; what\nsometimes seems to be an indexical idea or proposition is in fact\nmerely an indexical expression of an idea or proposition.\n(See, however, an opposite view defended in Textor 1996.)\n\nBolzano combines his doctrine that the form \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) is\ncommon to all propositions with a correspondence theory of truth,\nwhereby he, like Aristotle, avoids speaking of correspondence or\nadequation. A proposition \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) is true, according to\nBolzano, iff \\(A\\) has (in fact) \\(b\\) (WL I, 112). There is an\nimportant qualification, however, that Bolzano has thereby in mind,\nnamely that there is at least one \\(A\\); a proposition \\([A\\) has\n\\(b]\\) can only be true, according to Bolzano, if it is about\nsomething and if its subject idea \\([A]\\) is therefore non-empty (WL\nII, 16, 328\u2013330, 399 ff.). Formulated more carefully,\nBolzano\u2019s truth condition must therefore be stated as follows\n(WL I, 112, 121\u2013224, WL II, 26 f., 328\u2013330):\n\n\\([A\\) has \\(b]\\) is true (or: has truth) iff \\([A]\\) is\nnon-empty, and for every \\(x\\) that is an object of \\([A]\\) there is a\n\\(y\\) that is an object of \\([b]\\) such that \\(x\\) has \\(y\\).\n\n\nDue to this definition of truth and due to Bolzano\u2019s doctrine\nthat every proposition has the form \\([A\\) has \\(b]\\), every\nproposition has existential import for Bolzano.\n(\u2018Existential\u2019 must here be taken in the sense of\nBolzano\u2019s \u2018there is\u2019. It must be kept in mind here\nthat Bolzano\u2019s interpretation transfers many propositions to a\nmeta-level and that in such a case the existential import concerns\n\\([A]\\) rather than \\(A\\) itself; the existence of \\([A]\\), however,\nis guaranteed even if \\([A]\\) is empty and \\(A\\) itself does not\nexist.) This peculiar kind of an existential presupposition of\nBolzano\u2019s logic makes his theory of syllogisms (which he himself\nsaw as a mere section of his whole logic) an intermediate system\nbetween Aristotle and Venn: Whereas Aristotle\u2019s theory of\ncategorical syllogisms does not allow empty terms at all,\nBolzano\u2019s logic does so, but they cannot be the subject ideas of\ntrue propositions in Bolzano\u2019s logic. As a consequence, the\nso-called conclusio ad subalternatam is logically valid also\nfor Bolzano, i.e., [Some \\(A\\) have \\(b]\\) follows logically from [All\n\\(A\\) have \\(b]\\) (WL II, 114, 399 ff.), but [All \\(A\\) are \\(A]\\) or\n\u2014 in Bolzano\u2019s notation \u2014 [All \\(A\\) have \\(a]\\) is\nnot logically true for him; furthermore [All \\(A\\) have non-\\(b]\\) is\nnot convertible, i.e., [All \\(B\\) have non-\\(a]\\) does not logically\nfollow from [All \\(A\\) have non-\\(b]\\) (WL II, 401 f., 526). Therefore\nexactly two of the 24 valid Aristotelian syllogisms (namely the\nmodi CAMENES \u2014 or CALENTES in Bolzano\u2019s\nterminology \u2014 and CAMENOP of form IV) are invalid in\nBolzano\u2019s logic as he himself proved by means of\ncounter-examples (WL II, 415, 558), whereas all other Aristotelian\nmodi (including the weakened ones) are logically valid also\nin Bolzano\u2019s logic.\n",
