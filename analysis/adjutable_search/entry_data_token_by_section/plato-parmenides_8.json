Paradigmatism is incompatible both\nwith the proposal that forms are thoughts and with the Pie Model\nconception of partaking. The idea that forms are patterns that\nserve as models for their participants is not new, for it appears in\nvarious places in the dialogues of Plato\u2019s middle period (see\nRepublic 472b7\u2013c7, 510a ff., 597a4\u20135,\n596b6\u20138\u2014and also\nTimaeus 29c1\u20132, 48e5\u201349a1, 50c4\u20136).\n\n\nMost commentators agree that Parmenides\u2019 criticism of\nSocrates\u2019 Paradigmatism depends (at least in part) on the\nconstruction of an infinite regress. But scholars are divided\nover the identity and structure of the regress: whereas some see the\nreasoning as basically indistinguishable from the Third Man argument (e.g.,\nOwen (1953), Vlastos (1954), Cherniss (1957), Hathaway (1973), Lee\n(1973), Teloh (1981, 166), Spellman (1983), Prior (1985, 71\u201375), and\nFine (1993, 211\u2013215)), others see the reasoning as generating a regress\nof forms of likeness (e.g., McCabe (1994, 87\u201389), Schofield (1996),\nAllen (1997, 179\u2013186), and Rickless (2007, 80\u201385)). (The main\ntextual and thematic reasons for preferring the latter reading to the\nformer are clearly described in Schofield (1996)\u2014see also Gill\n(1996, 44\u201345). For a rejoinder to Schofield, see Scolnicov (2003,\n67\u201368).)\n\n\nOn the first view, the regress arises as follows. Consider a plurality\nof F things, A, B, and C. By\nOne-over-Many, each of A,\nB, C is F by virtue of partaking of a form\nof F-ness (say, F1).  By\nSelf-Predication, F1\nis F. Hence A, B, C\nand F1 are all F, and each is like the others in\nbeing F. Now consider the new plurality of F\nthings, A, B, C, and F1. By\nOne-over-Many, each of\nA, B, C, and F1 is F by\nvirtue of partaking of a form of F-ness (say,\nF2). By Non-Identity, F2 is numerically distinct\nfrom F1.  By Self-Predication, F2\nis F. Hence A, B, C, F1,\nand F2 are all\nF, and each is like the others in being F. Now\nconsider the new plurality of F\nthings, A, B, C, F1,\nand F2. By One-over-Many, each\nof A, B, C, F1, and F2\nis F by virtue of partaking of a form of\nF-ness (say, F3). By Non-Identity, F3 is\nnumerically distinct from both F1 and F2. We\ntherefore have three distinct forms of\nF-ness. Repetition of the same pattern of reasoning then\nestablishes the existence of an infinite regress of forms of\nF-ness. This reasoning is homologous to the Third Man argument\ninasmuch as both arguments rely in the very same way on One-over-Many,\nSelf-Predication, and Non-Identity.\n\n\nOn the second view, the regress arises differently. In particular, the\nreasoning relies explicitly on Paradigmatism and on an assumption that\nParmenides emphasizes as he is setting up his criticism, namely that\nthe relation of likeness is symmetrical: if X is\nlike Y, then Y is like X\n(Parmenides 132d5\u20137). Consider two things, A\nand B, that both have the property of being F.\nGiven that there is a property that A and B both\nshare, it follows that\nA is like B and that B is\nlike A. Thus, A is like something (and hence, in\nsome way, like) and B is like something (and hence, in some\nway, like). But, by One-over-Many, A and B are both\nlike by virtue of partaking of a form of likeness\n(say, L1). Now assume for reductio that something is\nlike L1 or L1 is like something. Clearly\nif L1 is like something, then L1 is (in some way)\nlike. And if something is like L1, then, by symmetry of\nlikeness, L1 is like it, and hence again L1 is (in\nsome way) like. So, whether something is like L1\nor L1 is like something,\nL1 is like. Now, by One-over-Many, L1 is like by\nvirtue of partaking of a form of likeness (say, L2), and\nhence L1 partakes of\nL2. By Non-Identity, L2 is numerically distinct\nfrom L1.  But also, by Paradigmatism, L1 is\nlike L2, and hence, by symmetry of likeness, L2 is\nlike L1. So L2 is (in some way) like. By\nOne-over-Many, then, L1 and L2 are like by virtue of\npartaking of a form of likeness (say, L3), and\nhence L1 and L2 both partake of\nL3. By Non-Identity, L3 is numerically distinct from\nboth L1 and\nL2. This gives us three distinct forms of likeness.\nRepetition of the same pattern of reasoning then establishes the\nexistence of an infinite regress of forms of likeness. Taking for\ngranted that the existence of such a regress is in some way absurd or\nproblematic, Parmenides infers that the assumption for\nreductio is false, i.e., that nothing is like L1\nand L1 is like nothing. But this result is itself\nunacceptable. For we already have it that A and B\nare like by virtue of partaking of L1, and hence\nthat A and B partake of L1. By\nParadigmatism, A and B are like L1, and\nhence something is like L1. Moreover, by symmetry of\nlikeness, L1 is like A and B, and\nhence L1 is like something. Thus the assumption\nfor reductio is true. Contradiction. Notice that, on the\nsecond view, the reasoning leading to the relevant regress\nis not homologous to the Third Man argument: instead of\nderiving the claim that each form of likeness is like from\nSelf-Predication, Parmenides infers it from the conjunction of\nParadigmatism and the symmetry of likeness.\n\n\nOn either interpretation of the identity and structure of the relevant\nregress, it is as yet unclear why Parmenides finds the regress\nproblematic. It is reasonable to assume that Parmenides\u2019\nreason for finding the likeness regress problematic is the same as his\nreason for finding the largeness regress problematic in the Third Man\nargument. The same three options canvassed in section 4.3 are\navailable. Some contend that the regress is epistemic and vicious\nby its very nature, others that the regress conflicts with Uniqueness,\nand yet others that the regress leads to the claim that each form in\nthe relevant infinite hierarchy is many, and hence, by Oneness and\nPurity-F, both one and not one.\n",
