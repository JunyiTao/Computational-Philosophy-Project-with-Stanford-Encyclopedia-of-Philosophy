    "main_text": "The Theistic Proofs || The argument of the Proslogion\n2.3 The argument of the Proslogion\n\nLooking back on the sixty-five chapters of complicated argument in the\nMonologion, Anselm found himself wishing for a simpler way to\nestablish all the conclusions he wanted to prove. As he tells us in\nthe preface to the Proslogion, he wanted to find\n\na single argument that needed nothing but itself alone for proof, that\nwould by itself be enough to show that God really exists; that he is\nthe supreme good, who depends on nothing else, but on whom all things\ndepend for their being and for their well-being; and whatever we\nbelieve about the divine nature. (P, preface)\n\n\nThat \u201csingle argument\u201d is the one that appears in chapter\n2 of the Proslogion. (Or so it is commonly said: but some\ninterpreters understand the \u201cone argument\u201d as extending\ninto chapter 3, and Holopainen 1996 argues that it is the\nformula \u201cthat than which a greater cannot be\nthought.\u201d)\n\nThe proper way to state Anselm\u2019s argument is a matter of\ndispute, and any detailed statement of the argument will beg\ninterpretative questions. But on a fairly neutral or consensus reading\nof the argument (which I shall go on to reject), Anselm\u2019s\nargument goes like this. God is \u201cthat than which a greater\ncannot be thought\u201d; in other words, he is a being so great, so\nfull of metaphysical oomph, that one cannot so much as conceive of a\nbeing who would be greater than God. The Psalmist, however, tells us\nthat \u201cThe fool has said in his heart, \u2018There is no\nGod\u2019 \u201d (Psalm 14:1; 53:1). Is it possible to convince the\nfool that he is wrong? It is. All we need is the characterization of\nGod as \u201cthat than which a greater cannot be thought.\u201d The\nfool does at least understand that definition. But whatever is\nunderstood exists in the understanding, just as the plan of a painting\nhe has yet to execute already exists in the understanding of the\npainter. So that than which a greater cannot be thought exists in the\nunderstanding. But if it exists in the understanding, it must also\nexist in reality. For it is greater to exist in reality than to exist\nmerely in the understanding. Therefore, if that than which a greater\ncan be thought existed only in the understanding, it would be possible\nto think of something greater than it (namely, that same being\nexisting in reality as well). It follows, then, that if that than\nwhich a greater cannot be thought existed only in the understanding,\nit would not be that than which a greater cannot be thought; and that,\nobviously, is a contradiction. So that than which a greater cannot be\nthought must exist in reality, not merely in the understanding.\n\nVersions of this argument have been defended and criticized by a\nsuccession of philosophers from Anselm\u2019s time through the\npresent day (see\n ontological arguments).\n Our concern here is with Anselm\u2019s own version, the criticism he\nencountered, and his response to that criticism. A monk named Gaunilo\nwrote a \u201cReply on Behalf of the Fool,\u201d contending that\nAnselm\u2019s argument gave the Psalmist\u2019s fool no good reason\nat all to believe that that than which a greater cannot be thought\nexists in reality. Gaunilo\u2019s most famous objection is an\nargument intended to be exactly parallel to Anselm\u2019s that\ngenerates an obviously absurd conclusion. Gaunilo proposes that\ninstead of \u201cthat than which a greater cannot be thought\u201d\nwe consider \u201cthat island than which a greater cannot be\nthought.\u201d We understand what that expression means, so\n(following Anselm\u2019s reasoning) the greatest conceivable island\nexists in our understanding. But (again following Anselm\u2019s\nreasoning) that island must exist in reality as well; for if it did\nnot, we could imagine a greater island \u2013 namely, one that\nexisted in reality \u2013 and the greatest conceivable island would\nnot be the greatest conceivable island after all. Surely, though, it\nis absurd to suppose that the greatest conceivable island actually\nexists in reality. Gaunilo concludes that Anselm\u2019s reasoning is\nfallacious.\n\nGaunilo\u2019s counterargument is so ingenious that it stands out as\nby far the most devastating criticism in his catalogue of\nAnselm\u2019s errors. Not surprisingly, then, interpreters have read\nAnselm\u2019s reply to Gaunilo primarily in order to find his\nrejoinder to the Lost Island argument. Sympathetic interpreters (such\nas Klima 2000 and Ward 2018) have offered ways for Anselm to respond,\nbut at least one commentator (Wolterstorff 1993) argues that Anselm\noffers no such rejoinder, precisely because he knew Gaunilo\u2019s\ncriticism was unanswerable but could not bring himself to admit that\nfact.\n\nA more careful look at Anselm\u2019s reply to Gaunilo, however, shows\nthat Anselm offered no rejoinder to the Lost Island argument because\nhe rejected Gaunilo\u2019s interpretation of the original argument of\nthe Proslogion. Gaunilo had understood the argument in the\nway I stated it above. Anselm understood it quite differently. In\nparticular, Anselm insists that the original argument did not rely on\nany general principle to the effect that a thing is greater when it\nexists in reality than when it exists only in the\n understanding.[1]\n And since that is the principle that does the mischief in\nGaunilo\u2019s counterargument, Anselm sees no need to respond to the\nLost Island argument in particular.\n\nCorrectly understood, Anselm says, the argument of the\nProslogion can be summarized as follows:\n\nThat than which a greater cannot be thought can be thought.\nIf that than which a greater cannot be thought can be thought, it\nexists in reality.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThat than which a greater cannot be thought exists in\nreality.\n\n\nAnselm defends (1) by showing how we can form a conception of that\nthan which a greater cannot be thought on the basis of our experience\nand understanding of those things than which a greater can be\nthought. For example,\n\nit is clear to every reasonable mind that by raising our thoughts from\nlesser goods to greater goods, we are quite capable of forming an idea\nof that than which a greater cannot be thought on the basis of that\nthan which a greater can be thought. Who, for example, is unable to\nthink \u2026 that if something that has a beginning and end is good,\nthen something that has a beginning but never ceases to exist is much\nbetter? And that just as the latter is better than the former, so\nsomething that has neither beginning nor end is better still, even if\nit is always moving from the past through the present into the future?\nAnd that something that in no way needs or is compelled to change or\nmove is far better even than that, whether any such thing exists in\nreality or not? Can such a thing not be thought? Can anything greater\nthan this be thought? Or rather, is not this an example of forming an\nidea of that than which a greater cannot be thought on the basis of\nthose things than which a greater can be thought? So there is in fact\na way to form an idea of that than which a greater cannot be thought.\n(Anselm\u2019s Reply to Gaunilo 8)\n\n\nOnce we have formed this idea of that than which a greater cannot be\nthought, Anselm says, we can see that such a being has features that\ncannot belong to a possible but non-existent object \u2013 or, in\nother words, that (2) is true. For example, a being that is capable of\nnon-existence is less great than a being that exists necessarily. If\nthat than which a greater cannot be thought does not exist, it is\nobviously capable of non-existence; and if it is capable of\nnon-existence, then even if it were to exist, it would not be that\nthan which a greater cannot be thought after all. So if that than\nwhich a greater cannot be thought can be thought \u2013 that is, if\nit is a possible being \u2013 it actually exists.
