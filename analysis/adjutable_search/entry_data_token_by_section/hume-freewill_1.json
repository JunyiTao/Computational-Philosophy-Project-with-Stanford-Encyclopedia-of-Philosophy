Hume\u2019s Naturalism and Strawson\u2019s \u201cReconciling Project\u201d\nThe next question to consider is whether or not the issues that divide the classical and naturalistic interpretations are of any contemporary significance or interest? The first thing to be said about this is that from a contemporary perspective, classical compatibilism seems too crude an account of both freedom and moral responsibility and very few philosophers would still press the claim that incompatibilist prejudices can be explained simply in terms of confusion about necessity arising from a conflation between causation and compulsion. In contrast with this, Hume\u2019s concern with the role and relevance of moral sentiment for our understanding of the free will problem anticipates several key features of P.F. Strawson\u2019s highly influential contribution to the contemporary debate. Strawson\u2019s \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d [hereafter FR] is arguably the most important and influential paper concerning the free will problem published in the second half of the twentieth century. The most striking affinity between the approaches taken by Hume and Strawson is their shared appeal to the role of moral sentiments or reactive attitudes, which both use as a way of discrediting any supposed sceptical threat arising from the thesis of determinism.\nOn Strawson\u2019s account, both classical compatibilists (whom he refers to as \u201coptimists\u201d) and libertarians (whom he refers to as \u201cpessimists\u201d, because they suppose determinism threatens moral responsibility) make a similar mistake of \u201cover-intellectualizing the facts\u201d by seeking to provide some sort of \u201cexternal \u2018rational\u2019 justification\u201d for moral responsibility (FR, 81). The classical compatibilist does this on the basis of a \u201cone-eyed utilitarianism\u201d, whereas the libertarian, seeing that something vital is missing from the classical compatibilist account, tries to plug the gap with \u201ccontra-causal freedom\u201d \u2013 which Strawson describes as \u201ca pitiful intellectualist trinket\u201d (FR, 81). Against views of these kinds, Strawson argues that we should focus our attention on the importance of reactive attitudes or moral sentiments in this context. By this means he hopes to find some middle ground whereby he can \u201creconcile\u201d the two opposing camps. Our reactive attitudes or moral sentiments, Strawson argues, should be understood in terms of our natural human emotional responses to the attitudes and intentions that human beings manifest towards each other. We expect and demand some degree of good will and due regard and we feel resentment or gratitude depending on whether or not this is shown to us (FR, 66\u20137). Granted that these emotions are part of our essential human make-up, and are naturally triggered or aroused in relevant circumstances, it is still important to recognize that these responses are in some measure under rational control and we can \u201cmodify or mollify\u201d them in light of relevant considerations (FR, 68).\nThere are two kinds of consideration that Strawson distinguishes that may require us to amend or withdraw our reactive attitudes. First, there are considerations that we may describe as exemptions, where we judge that an individual is not an appropriate or suitable target of any reactive attitudes. These are cases where a person may be viewed as \u201cpsychologically abnormal\u201d or \u201cmorally underdeveloped\u201d (FR, 68; and also 71\u20132). On the other hand, even where exemptions of this sort do not apply, ordinary excusing considerations may nevertheless require us to alter or change our particular reactive attitudes as directed toward some individual (FR, 68). Considerations of this kind include cases where an agent acts accidentally, or in ignorance, or was subject to physical force of some kind. Where these considerations apply we may come to recognize that the conduct in question, properly interpreted, does not lack the degree of good will or due regard that we may demand. Even if some injury has occurred, no malice or lack of regard has been shown to us. However, the crucial point for Strawson is that while our reactive attitudes may well be modified or withdrawn in these circumstances, there is no question of us altogether abandoning or suspending our reactive attitudes (FR, 71\u20133). In particular, there is nothing about the thesis of determinism that implies that either exemptions or excuses, as Strawson has described them, apply or hold universally (FR, 70\u20131). Moreover, and more controversially, Strawson also maintains that even if determinism did provide some \u201ctheoretical\u201d basis for drawing this sceptical conclusion, any such policy is \u201cfor us as we are, practically inconceivable\u201d (FR, 71). In other words, according to Strawson our natural commitment to the fabric of moral sentiment insulates us from any possible global sceptical threat to the whole fabric of moral responsibility based on theoretical worries about the implications of determinism.\nIf we read Hume along the lines of the classical interpretation, then his position on these issues looks as if it accords very closely with the typical \u201coptimist\u201d strategy associated with such thinkers as Schlick. The classical interpretation, however, entirely overlooks the role of moral sentiment in Hume\u2019s reconciling strategy. It emphasizes the relevance of the (supposed) confusion between causation and compulsion in order to explain the more fundamental confusion about the nature of liberty (i.e., why philosophers tend to confuse liberty of spontaneity with liberty of indifference). With these features of Hume\u2019s position established, the classical interpretation points to Hume\u2019s remarks concerning the social utility of rewards and punishments and the way in which they depend on the principles of necessity. From this perspective, Hume\u2019s discussion of freedom and necessity clearly constitutes a paradigmatic and influential statement of the \u201coptimist\u2019s\u201d position. So interpreted, Hume must be read as a thinker, like Schlick, who has \u201cover-intellectualized the facts\u201d on the basis of a \u201cone-eyed-utilitarianism\u201d; one who has ignored \u201cthat complicated web of attitudes and feelings\u201d which Strawson seeks to draw our attention to. In this way, we are encouraged to view Hume as a prime target of Strawson\u2019s attack on the \u201coptimist\u201d position.\nThe naturalistic interpretation, by contrast, makes it plain that any such view of Hume\u2019s approach and general strategy is deeply mistaken. Hume, no less than Strawson, is especially concerned to draw our attention to the facts about human nature that are relevant to a proper understanding of the nature and conditions of moral responsibility. More specifically, Hume argues that we cannot properly account for moral responsibility unless we acknowledge and describe the role that moral sentiment plays in this sphere. Indeed, unlike Strawson, Hume is much more concerned with the detailed mechanism whereby our moral sentiments are aroused, and thus he is particularly concerned to explain the relevance of spontaneity, indifference, and necessity to the functioning of moral sentiment. To this extent, therefore, Hume\u2019s naturalistic approach is more tightly woven into his account of the nature of necessity and moral freedom. In sum, when we compare Hume\u2019s arguments with Strawson\u2019s important and influential discussion, it becomes immediately apparent that there is considerable contemporary significance to the contrast between the classical and naturalistic interpretations of Hume\u2019s reconciling strategy.\nThe overall resemblance between Hume\u2019s and Strawson\u2019s strategy in dealing with issues of freedom and responsibility is striking. The fundamental point that they agree about is that we cannot understand the nature and conditions of moral responsibility without reference to the crucial role that moral sentiment plays in this sphere. This naturalistic approach places Hume and Strawson in similar positions when considered in relation to the views of the pessimist and the optimist. The naturalistic approach shows that, in different ways, both sides of the traditional debate fail to properly acknowledge the facts about moral sentiment. Where Hume most noticeably differs from Strawson, however, is on the question of the \u201cgeneral causes\u201d of moral sentiment. Strawson largely bypasses this problem. For Hume, this is a crucial issue that must be settled to understand why necessity is essential to responsibility and why indifference is entirely incompatible with the effective operation of the mechanism that responsibility depends on.\n",
