    "main_text": "The Emergence of Ecological Rationality || Rational Analysis\n3.3 Rational Analysis\n\nRational analysis is a methodology applied in cognitive science and\nbiology to explain why a cognitive system or organism engages in a\nparticular behavior by appealing to the presumed goals of the\norganism, the adaptive pressures of its environment, and the\norganism\u2019s computational limitations. Once an organism\u2019s\ngoals are identified, the adaptive pressures of its environment\nspecified, and the computational limitations are accounted for, an\noptimal solution under those conditions is derived to explain why a\nbehavior that is otherwise ineffective may nevertheless be effective\nin achieving that goal under those conditions (Marr 1982; Anderson\n1991; Oaksford & Chater 1994; Palmer 1999). Rational analyses are\ntypically formulated independently of the cognitive processes or\nbiological mechanisms that explain how an organism realizes a\nbehavior.\n\nOne theme to emerge from the rational analysis literature that has\ninfluenced bounded rationality is the study of memory (Anderson &\nSchooler 1991). For instance, given the statistical features of our\nenvironment, and the sorts of goals we typically pursue, forgetting is\nan advantage rather than a liability (Schooler & Hertwig 2005).\nMemory traces vary in their likelihood of being used, so the memory\nsystem will try to make readily available those memories which are\nmost likely to be useful. This is a rational analysis style argument,\nwhich is a common feature of the Bayesian turn in cognitive psychology\n(Oaksford & Chater 2007; Friston 2010). More generally, spacial\narrangements of objects in the environment can simplify perception,\nchoice, and the internal computation necessary for producing an\neffective solution (Kirsch 1995). Compare this view to the discussion\nof recency or availability effects distorting subjective probability\nestimates in\n section 2.4.\n\nRational analyses separate the goal of behavior from the mechanisms\nthat cause behavior. Thus, when an organism\u2019s observed behavior\nin an environment does not agree with the behavior prescribed by a\nrational analysis for that environment, there are traditionally three\nresponses. One strategy is to change the specifications of the\nproblem, by introducing an intermediate step or changing the goal\naltogether, or altering the environmental constraints, et cetera\n(Anderson & Schooler 1991; Oaksford & Chater 1994). Another\nstrategy is to argue that mechanisms matter after all, so details of\nhuman psychology are taken into an alternative account (Newell &\nSimon 1972; Gigerenzer, Todd, et al. 1999; Todd, Gigerenzer, et al.\n2012). A third option is to enrich rational analysis by incorporating\ncomputational mechanisms directly into the model (Russell &\nSubramanian 1995; Chater 2014). Lewis, Howes, and Singh, for instance,\npropose to construct theories of rationality from (i) structural\nfeatures of the task environment; (ii) the bounded machine the\ndecision-process will run on, about which they consider four different\nclasses of computational resources that may be available to an agent;\nand (iii) a utility function to specify the goal, numerically, so as\nto supply an objective function against which to score outcomes (Lewis\net al. 2014).\n",
