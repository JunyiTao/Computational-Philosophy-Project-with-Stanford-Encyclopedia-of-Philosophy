    "main_text": "Metaphysics\n3. Metaphysics\n\n\nThe existing evidence about Numenius suggests that he was strongly\nconcerned with metaphysics. His metaphysical views can be distinguished\ninto ontological and theological ones. The remains of his treatise\nOn the Good show, however, that these two sets of views were closely\nlinked together.  Numenius defines the subject matter of this treatise\nas an investigation of the question what is being (fr. 3.1, fr. 5.5,\nfr.  7.12\u201313), which is reminiscent of Aristotle's definition of\nfirst philosophy, or metaphysics,\nin Metaphysics Gamma (1003a20\u201332). Quite\nnotably, however, Numenius declares that he will be guided in his\ninvestigation by the Timaeus (referring to\nTimaeus 27d-28a; fr. 7.8-12). In line with\nthe Timaeus, Numenius treats the Good, the highest principle,\nas well as the lower principles of reality that he introduces, as\ngods.\n\nNumenius maintains a sharp distinction between the sensible and the\nintelligible world\u2014the realms of becoming and (true or pure)\nbeing respectively (fr. 16.8\u201310). In his On the Good he\nproceeds in an ontologically ascending order, starting with sensible\n(physical) entities, moving to the intelligible ones (including\nPlatonic Forms), and finally to the first principle, the Good, that is\nthe Platonic Form of the Good in the Republic (508e) that he\nidentifies with God (that is, the first and highest god). Arriving at\nthis divine first principle is the final aim of the treatise. This is\nunderstandable since according to Numenius everything that exists in\nthe world as it is, depends on the Good, the God, which is the cause\nof everything's goodness in the world (fr. 19.5-7). Beginning his\ninvestigation from natural elements (stoicheia), namely\nearth, fire, water, and air (cf. Timaeus 31b-c), Numenius\nargues that no such element can possibly qualify as a being (as having\nbeing), first because elements, like syllables, cannot exist by\nthemselves but only in combination, and secondly because no bodily\nentity whatever can qualify as a being (as having being), because\nbodies are subject to change (fr.  3.1\u20138). This means that all\nbodies have, at best, being-and-not-being (cf. Republic\n479c). What is more, Numenius suggests that for a body to exist, there\nmust be something to keep it together and account for its unity\n(fr. 4b.11-19), and this cannot be a further body but rather must be a\npower (dynamis; fr. 4b18), that is an intelligible entity,\nfor instance a soul, which is necessary to account for the unity of\nbodies, as we see that it does for living things (fr. 4b). In the\nTimaeus (33b), for instance, it is made clear that it is the\nworld-soul that keeps the body of the world together.\n\n\nSuch an argument shows that Numenius has strong views about the\nontological status of matter, the basis, he supposes, of all bodies\n(fr. 4b.25). In his 4th c. CE Latin commentary on the\nTimaeus Calcidius presents a long discussion about the status\nof matter (In Timaeum p. 297.7-301.20 Waszink), claiming that\nthis is based on Numenius (fr. 52.2). If Numenius did elaborate on the\nstatus of matter along the lines suggested in Calcidius, that must be\nbecause it was crucial to do so for his argument about what qualifies\nas being and also how the world has come into existence.  Interpreting\nthe Timaeus literally, Numenius maintains that matter has\nnever come into existence but is co-eternal with, and yet distinct\nfrom, God (fr. 52.7\u201314; cf. Alcinous, Didascalicus ch.\n12, 166.15\u201330 Hermann), unlimited (apeiros), indefinite\n(aoristos), without form and quality (fr. 52.6\u201314,\n44\u201345; cf. Antiochus in Cicero, Academica II.27,\nAlcinous, Didascalicus 163.6 Hermann). Numenius like other\nPlatonists of his age follows Aristotle in identifying Plato's\nreceptacle in the Timaeus with matter, which Aristotle\ncharacterizes as non being (Physics 192a3-14), formless and\nqualiteless (De caelo 306b17-19; cf. Timaeus\n50d7). This lack of form of matter amounts to lack of reason for\nNumenius (alogos; fr. 4a.1\u20134). In the same vein already\nPlutarch (De Iside 374C f.) identified matter with Poverty\n(penia that is informed by Abundance (poros), giving\na cosmological twist in Plato's myth in the Symposium (203B\nf.). Since matter is lacking reason, Numenius considers it in itself\ndisordered (ataktos) and unknowable\n(fr. 4.4\u20135). Because disorder and division were taken to be\nessential characteristics of matter in the earlier Platonist\ntradition, matter had been identified with the indefinite\n\u201cdyad\u201d that is referred to in Aristotle's account\nof Plato's metaphysics (cf. Plato, Parmenides 149d2; see\nBaltes 1975, 255\u20136). This was widely maintained among the\nPythagorean Platonists (Sextus Empiricus, Against the\nMathematicians 10.261), including Eudorus (Simpicius, In\nPhysica 181.7\u201330, 281.5) and Moderatus\n(ibid. 231.8\u20139; see Frede 1987, 1052). Numenius follows\nprecisely this line of thought (frs. 11.15, 52.6). And since for\nNumenius disorder amounts to badness, he considers matter to be bad,\nthe source and cause of all instances of badness and disorder in the\nworld (fr. 52.37\u20139, 63\u201364). Numenius might appear to\nmaintain that disordered matter (cf. Timaeus 30a) is animated\nby an evil world soul (fr. 52.64\u20135), as might be suggested in\nLaws 10 (896e) (cf. Plutarch, De animae procreatione in\nTimaeo 1014D). However, Calcidius' text, which preserves this\nview of Numenius, suggests instead that matter is not animated by, but\nsomehow simply is the evil world soul, that is, matter has life of its\nown (fr.  52.44\u201347, 66\u201367; see Baltes 1975, 247\u2013248\nbut also Deuse, 1983, 68\u201373, Phillips 2002, 237).  This is\npresumably because a soul, if it animates anything, cannot be really\nevil in doing so, as it is the principle of life. And life is one kind\nof order and thus good (see Waszink 1966, 68\u20139, Baltes 1975,\n250\u2013251, Frede 1987, 1053). The fact that for Numenius matter is\nbad, however, does not necessarily entail that the material world is\nalso bad, as Dillon (1977, 369) suggests, associating Numenius with\nthe Gnostic idea of an evil world. It actually seems that quite the\nopposite is the case: for Numenius the world is good because it is\nordered due to the dominance of the highest principle, the Good.\n\n\nNow, for Platonists only intelligible entities can account for order\nwhich amounts to goodness. A Platonic Form, for instance, is\nresponsible for the ordered existence of the physical things it is the\nForm of. A soul too accounts for the existence of living things, such\nas animals. Since the world has an order of its own as a single\nwell-ordered whole, there must be such an intelligible entity that\naccounts for the world's order, wherein its goodness or orderliness\nlies (kosmos). Being the source of this comprehensive\ngoodness, this must itself be surpassingly good (frs. 16.14\u201315,\n19, 20).  Platonists tended to identify this principle with the Form\nof the Good in the Republic (508e), which is the source of\nall being. It was also traditional among them to think of this\nprinciple as a divine one or unit\u2014God.\n\n\nNumenius, then, distinguishes two sources of reality, or two\nontological principles, God-the Good and matter (inspired by\nTimaeus 47e-48a and Aristotle's report about Plato's\nprinciples in Metaphysics 988a7\u201315). Yet the crucial\nquestion for Numenius was how one should think about this divine\nprinciple, the Good, what kind of God this is. Numenius' position on\nthis has much to do with his view on matter. Numenius advocates a\nstrong dualistic position. In this he is like Plutarch and later\nAtticus follows them.  Numenius' dualism is different from that of\nmost contemporary Pythagoreans we know of, like those referred to by\nAlexander Polyhistor (in Diogenes Laertius VIII.25), by Sextus\nEmpiricus (Against the Mathematicians X.261\u20132), by\nNicomachus of Gerasa (Theologia Arithm\u00eatik\u00ea in\nPhotius, Bibliotheca cod. 187, 143a24), by Eudorus\n(Simplicius, In Physica 181.10\u201330) and by Moderatus\n(Porphyry, On Matter in Simplicius, In Physica\n231.6\u201324). Those Pythagoreans postulated God or One, on the one\nhand, and matter or the indefinite dyad, on the other, but they\nmaintained that God or One is the ultimate principle of everything\n(Simplicius, In Physica. 7.1\u201330); from this matter came\ninto existence through the total privation of form\n(ibid. 231.7\u20139). Numenius appears to be reacting against this\nview, which is associated specifically with Moderatus\n(fr. 52.15\u201323; see Kahn 2001, 133). Numenius rejects Moderatus'\nview in favor of his own dualistic position, presumably because he\nwants to avoid the implication of the monistic position that God is\nthe source of what is bad. This concern seems also to motivate\nNumenius to distance God from matter as much as possible. He thus\ndistinguishes the divine demiurge, who creates the physical world by\nimposing order on matter, from the highest God. This highest God is\nmetaphysically above the demiurge (frs. 16, 17, 19\u201321) in the\nsense that the highest God, which Numenius also calls the first\nintellect (fr. 20.12), is inert (fr. 12.13, 15.2) and utterly simple\n(fr.  11.11\u201314), qualifies as being itself (auto on;\nfr. 17.4) and the source of being (fr. 16.4\u20135, 9), while the\ndemiurge is the source of generation (fr. 16.5); the highest God is\nabsolute goodness (frs. 16.4, 9\u201310, 20.12), identical with the\nForm of the Good (fr.  20.5, 11). Unlike the Form of the Good in\nRepublic VI, however, that is beyond being, Numenius' first\nGod is being, and indeed the source of it. This is not at odds with\nthe Republic, however, since several passages in it describe\nthe Good as being (518c9, 526e3-4, 532c5-6; see Burnyeat 2005,\n154-155). Numenius apparently takes stance in a debate among\nPlatonists as to whether the first principle is being or beyond being\n(Origen, Against Celsus IV.64.14-28). Numenius actually\ndescribes the First God as being (ho \u00f4n), a phrase that\nalludes to Exodus 3.14 (fr. 13.4). This Biblical reference has been\nmuch debated and a number of alterations of the text have been\nproposed (see Dodds 1960, 15-16, Baltes 1975, 262, Dillon 1977, 368,\nTarrant 1979, Edwards 1989). None of these proposals is however\nconvincing since Numenius frequently designates the first God as being\n(frs. 5.5-14, 6.7-8, 8.2; see Whittaker 1978, Edwards 1990b, 21-22,\nand also Burnyeat 2005, 149-162). Yet this first God that is\nidentified with being and absolute goodness, remains \u201calone,\nisolated, abandoned\u201d (fr. 2.9),which suggests that this God,\nlike Plotinus' One, is ineffable and incomprehensible (see Whittaker,\n1993). Numenius thus sets himself apart from those Platonists who\nidentified the divine demiurge of the Timaeus with the Form\nof the Good of Republic VI (508e), but his view is adopted by\nAlcinous (Didascalicus ch. 10, 164.27\u2013165.16 Hermann),\nwho must be writing some decades later than Numenius.\n\nNumenius faces two challenges. First, how can the first God be the\nultimate cause of everything, as it appears it ought to be\n(fr. 16.1\u20132, 9), if it is inert? Second how can it be simple, as\nNumenius has claimed, if it is, as he has also claimed, an intellect\nthat thinks? Numenius maintains that the first or highest God, or\nfirst intellect, brings about a second one (frs. 13, 21.7), in fact\nthe divine demiurge, and uses this second intellect as an instrument\nof its thinking (fr.  22.1\u20132). It is not clear what this\ninstrumental use (proschr\u00easis fr. 22.2) amounts to, but\nwe find similar vocabulary in the Timaeus (28a7) for the use\nof the Forms by the demiurge. It is clearer however that the second\nintellect thinks of the Forms and creates by imposing them on matter\n(fr. 18.10). Numenius is inspired again by the Timaeus. On\nthe basis of Timaeus 39e7-9 he believes that the demiurge\nencompasses all Forms in him. To the extent that all other Forms exist\nby participating in the Form of the Good (frs. 16.2\u20135,\n46b\u2013c), which is identical with the first intellect, this\nintellect accounts also for the (other) Forms (Frede 1987,\n1060\u20131063), while it is the second god who actually thinks of\nthem. The first intellect thinks only itself, like the Aristotelian\nGod of Metaphysics Lambda, and in this sense its being and\nits object of thought are identical. Hence the first God remains\nabsolutely simple, pure goodness, is at rest and inert, while the\nsecond god is in motion (fr. 15.3\u20134), is not simple, because it\ncontains the Forms of all entities, and is good only because of its\nrelation to the first God, the Form of the Good, a relation which\nNumenius describes as \u201cimitation\u201d (fr. 16.15), or as\n\u201cparticipation\u201d (frs. 19.9\u201311, 20.7\u201310). This,\nhowever, does not mean that Numenius considers the demiurge to be\nignorant and a less than good creator and in this sense like the\ndemiurge of the Gnostics, as Dillon (1977, 369) has argued. Although\nclearly the demiurge is not as good as the first God, however, for\nNumenius the demiurge is a recipient of the goodness of the highest\nGod, the Good, and in turn transmits this goodness to the world which\nit brings into existence (frs. 14,16, 19). In this respect Numenius'\ndemiurge is clearly different from the creator god of the\nGnostics.\n\nYet creation is a process which, according to the Timaeus,\ncan be divided into two stages, the demiurgic intellect's thinking of\nthe Forms of all entities and its imposing them on matter. Numenius\nmaintains that the demiurgic intellect, the second god in his\nhierarchy, splits into two when engaged in the creation in the world,\nbecause matter, which is required for and involved in creation, is\nsuch that it divides whatever has anything to do with it. One reason\nwhy matter divides is because it inspires desire in the demiurge (fr.\n11.13\u201316), presumably desire for imposing order and goodness. As\na result, the demiurge is divided into one intellect which continues\ncontemplating the Forms and another which imposes Forms on matter and\nthus orders matter (frs. 11.14\u201320, 16.10\u201312,\n21.4\u20135). This means that the demiurgic intellect engages in\ncreation through a third god, that is a third intellect\n(frs. 21.3\u20135, 22.4), which is thinking in a discursive way\n(dianooumenon; fr. 22.4), not in the purely contemplative way\nthat the demiurgic intellect thinks. This third god is conceived along\nthe lines of the world-soul of the Timaeus; it is perhaps\nfair to say that for Numenius the god that actually engages in\ncreation is in effect the world-soul of Plato's Timaeus\n(Baltes 1975, 267). Numenius uses very metaphorical language, inspired\nby the myth of Plato's Statesman, in order to present what\nthe demiurge does and how it thinks in doing it. He argues that it is\nlike a helmsman steering a ship using the Forms as instrument (fr. 18\nwith Statesman 272e; cf. Timaeus 39e). Despite the\nmetaphorical language, two things become reasonably clear. First, this\nintellect, the world-soul, is also active in preserving order and\nmaintaining the world in existence (frs. 12.14\u201319, 18,\n52.91\u20138). Secondly, the third god desires to create\n(fr. 11.16\u201320, 18.7\u201313), which amounts to saying that God,\nin the person of this third intellect, wants to impose order in the\nworld because order is good (see Deuse 1983, 65\u201367). Since this\nthird intellect is directly responsible for the existence of the\nworld, it is ultimately not distinguishable from the world itself\n(fr. 21.3), which according to Timaeus 34b1 is god, because\nit is this which keeps the world together (see also Tarrant 1979).\n\nThere is a question of how to understand Numenius' hierarchy of three\ngods. Should we take seriously Proclus' testimonies that suggest there\nare in fact three (frs. 21\u201322), or the fragments of Numenius\npreserved by Eusebius which suggest that there are actually only two\n(frs. 15\u201316, 20)? The question becomes accentuated in view of\nNumenius' statement that the second and third gods are one, using the\nverb \u201cto be\u201d in the singular (estin; fr.\n11.14\u201315) in referring to them together. Frede (1987,\n1057\u20131059) has argued convincingly that the unity of the two\ndoes not mean their identity. The demiurge is split into two because\nof the effect of matter. The second god is divisible in the same way\nthat some other intelligible entities, such as human and animal soul,\nare (fr. 41.6).  Soul remains essentially the same in all animate\nbeings and yet is divided, in the process of ensoulment of the things\nthat it makes animate. This is the case with the demiurge as\nwell. That Numenius proposed a hierarchy of three distinct gods,\nrather than two (thus Holzhausen 1992, 253\u2013254), or three\naspects of one god (Kr\u00e4mer 1964, 88), is strengthened by the fact\nthat Christians like Origen and Eusebius, being Trinitarians, approve\nof his theology.\n\nNumenius' three gods are the principles of being (first God) and\ngeneration (second and third god; fr. 16), and thus of everything that\nexists. And because the highest god is absolute goodness, the world of\ngeneration becomes good and beautiful (fr. 16.16\u201317). Numenius\nadvanced the idea that goodness is transmitted from the highest God\nthrough the second, demiurgic intellect, which realizes creation\nthrough a third intellect, to the world without God actually doing\nanything (fr.  14.6\u201314), an idea further developed later by\nPlotinus (cf. Enneads I.6, III.8, V.8).\n",
