Women and Other Under-Represented Thinkers\n\n(Note: Treatment of these figures has not been integrated into the\nforegoing solely for the convenience of those interested primarily in\ntheir contributions.)\n\nA variety of circumstances\u2014religious, political, and\nsocial\u2014conspired to give women limited opportunities to engage\nin and with the contemporary intellectual culture, even compared to\ntheir French- and English-speaking contemporaries. The German-speaking\nlands of Europe lacked a major cosmopolitan centre, like London or\nParis, to germinate progressive ideas and to propagate those developed\nabroad. Moreover, the fact that, in spite of Thomasius\u2019 and\nWolff\u2019s efforts, German intellectuals continued to publish (and\nteach) in Latin through the first half of the eighteenth century,\nmeant that women\u2019s access to these ideas remained limited. There\nwere a handful of notable attempts by reformers (including Francke) to\nredress the general oversight of girls\u2019 education, but by and\nlarge their education was a private matter and in any case guided by\nthe traditional conception of women\u2019s threefold\nBestimmung as Gattin, Mutter, and\nHausfrau (wife, mother, and housewife).\n\nDespite these substantial obstacles, however, women did engage with\nthe figures and debates of the time, and indeed they contributed in\nvarious and integral ways to the history of German philosophy\nthroughout the eighteenth century. Similar to the British and French\ncontexts, women in Germany exerted an important influence on\nintellectual culture directly through the publication of conventional\ntreatises, but also indirectly through their correspondence with\nwell-known philosophers, through provoking and mediating intellectual\ndisputes, and (particularly in the second half of the eighteenth\ncentury) through hosting salons that attracted leading philosophers\nand scientists, among others. And, likewise comparable to the British\nand French contexts (cf. O\u2019Neill 1997), these contributions have\nbeen widely overlooked in subsequent histories of German philosophy,\nboth for familiar reasons having to do both with the narrowness of the\nconception of the philosophical canon (Shapiro 2016), but also due to\nthe concerted efforts among nineteenth-century German academics to\nexclude women from the academy (Ebbersmeyer 2020).\n",
