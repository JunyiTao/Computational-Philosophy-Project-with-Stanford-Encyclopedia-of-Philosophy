In his general discussion of mental representation,\nKant implies that immediacy and singularity are both criteria of\nnon-conceptual, intuitive representation, the species of\nrepresentation that grounds synthetic judgment. In a series of papers,\nCharles Parsons (Parsons 1964, 1969, 1984) has argued that the\nsyntheticity of mathematical judgments depends on mathematical\nintuitions being fundamentally immediate, and he explains the\nimmediacy of such representations in a perceptual way, as a direct,\nphenomenological presence to the mind. Jaakko Hintikka (Hintikka 1965,\n1967, 1969), developing an idea from E.W. Beth\u2019s earlier work,\ncounters that the syntheticity of mathematical judgments instead\ndepends only on the singularity of their intuitive constituents.\nHintikka assimilates mathematical intuitions to singular terms or\nparticulars, and explains the use of intuition in a mathematical\ncontext by analogy to an application of the logical rule of\nexistential instantiation. These two positions have come to be known\nas the \u201cphenomenological\u201d and \u201clogical\u201d\ninterpretations, respectively.\n\nMichael Friedman\u2019s original position (Friedman 1985, 1992) with\nrespect to the role of intuition in mathematical reasoning descends\nfrom Beth\u2019s and Hintikka\u2019s, though it is substantially\ndifferent from theirs and has been modified in his most recent\nwritings. In his Kant and the Exact Sciences (Friedman 1992),\nFriedman takes the position that our modern conception of logic ought\nto be used as a tool for interpreting (rather than criticizing) Kant,\nnoting that the explicit representation of an infinity of mathematical\nobjects that can be generated by the polyadic logic of modern\nquantification theory is conceptually unavailable to the mathematician\nand logician of Kant\u2019s time. As a result of the inadequacy of\nmonadic logic to represent an infinity of objects, the\neighteenth-century mathematician relies on intuition to deliver the\nrepresentations necessary for mathematical reasoning. Friedman\nexplicates the details of Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics on\nthe basis of this historical insight.\n\nFriedman has modified his original position in response to criticism\nfrom Emily Carson (Carson 1997), who has developed an interpretation\nof Kant\u2019s theory of geometry that is Parsonsian in its\nanti-formalist emphasis on the epistemological and phenomenological\nover the logical role for intuition in mathematics. In recent work\n(Friedman 2000, 2010), Friedman argues that the intuition that grounds\ngeometry is fundamentally kinematical, and is best explained by the\ntranslations and rotations that describe both the constructive action\nof the Euclidean geometer and the perceptual point of view of the\nordinary, spatially oriented observer. This account provides a\nsynthesis between the logical and phenomenological interpretive\naccounts, in large part by connecting the geometrical space that is\nexplored by the imagination via Euclidean constructions to the\nperspectival space that is, according to Kant, the form of all outer\nsensibility. More specifically, Friedman reconciles the logical\ninterpretation with the phenomenological by \u201c[embedding]\nthe purely logical understanding of geometrical constructions (as\nSkolem functions) within space as the pure form of our outer sensible\nintuition (as described in the Transcendental Aesthetic)\u201d\n(Friedman 2012, n.17). Additionally, Friedman has argued against\ndiagrammatic interpretations of Kantian intuition (Friedman 2012) and\nhas marshalled evidence from the B-Deduction to support his\nunderstanding of the connections among geometrical construction, the\nspace of perception, and physical space (Friedman 2020), and the\nrelation between geometry and experience (Friedman 2015).\n3.3. Current State of the Field\n\nNew generations of scholars contribute to a lively, fertile and\nongoing discussion about the interpretation and legacy of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophy of mathematics that originated with the literature\nmentioned in 3.1 and 3.2, above. However, recent work is not easily\ncategorized as landing on either side of one or another interpretive\ndebate; most scholars are using the field\u2019s foundational\ndiscussions as a springboard from which to explore the variety of ways\nin which mathematics plays a role in the critical philosophy. In 2020,\nCarl Posy and Ofra Rechter published the first volume of a two-volume\nsuccessor to Posy\u2019s 1992 collection, entitled\nKant\u2019s Philosophy of Mathematics, Volume I: The\nCritical Philosophy and Its Roots. This first volume includes\ntwelve essays on topics that range from the pre-critical origins of\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics to his critical thoughts on\nmathematical method, logic, geometry and arithmetic. The essays in the\nforthcoming second volume will focus on the reception and influence of\nKant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics. Also notable is a collection\nof articles first published in a special issue of the Canadian Journal\nof Philosophy, Kant: Studies on Mathematics in the Critical\nPhilosophy, edited by Emily Carson and Lisa Shabel (Carson and\nShabel 2014). The nine contributions collected here aim to explore the\ncentrality of mathematics in Kant\u2019s overall philosophical\nsystem. Daniel Sutherland has recently written a book-length\ntreatment of Kant\u2019s philosophy of mathematics,\nKant\u2019s Mathematical World: Mathematics, Cognition,\nand Experience (Sutherland 2021), in which he focuses on\nKant\u2019s theory of magnitudes as the key to Kant\u2019s account\nof our cognition and experience of the world. A second volume is\nforthcoming.",
