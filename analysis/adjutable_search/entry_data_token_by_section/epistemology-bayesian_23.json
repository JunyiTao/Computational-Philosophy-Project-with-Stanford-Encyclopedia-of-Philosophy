This section will examine some of the most\ninfluential ones. We will see that, to save that principle, some\nBayesians have tried to refine it into one or another version. A\nnumber of versions have been systematically compared in papers such as\nthose of Meacham (2015, 2016), Pettigrew (2020b), and Rescorla (2021),\nwhile the emphasis below will be centered on the proposed\ncounterexamples.\n\n",
