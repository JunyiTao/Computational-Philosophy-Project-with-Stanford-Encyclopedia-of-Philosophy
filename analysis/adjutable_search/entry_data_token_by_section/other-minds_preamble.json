    "main_text": "\n\nTextbooks in philosophy often refer to the problem of other\nminds. At a superficial glance it can look as if there is\nagreement about what the problem is and how we might address it. But\non closer inspection one finds there is little agreement either about\nthe problem or the solution to it. Indeed, there is little agreement\nabout whether there is a problem here at all. What seems clear is that\nthere was a period in philosophy, roughly around the mid-twentieth\ncentury, when there was much discussion about other minds. The problem\nhere has most commonly been thought to arise within epistemology: how\ndo I know (or how can I justify the belief) that other beings exist\nwho have thoughts, feelings and other mental attributes? One standard\nline of reply to this question has been to appeal to analogy, another\nto best explanation. More recently it has been suggested that\ntestimony can serve as a basic source of knowledge of another\u2019s\nmental states; that is, testimony can serve as a way of knowing here\nin the absence of any other way of knowing (see Gomes 2015). A\nsomewhat less standard approach to this question has been to appeal to\ncriteria. Connected with this approach, and fueled by the later work\nof Ludwig Wittgenstein, some philosophers argue that the real\nproblem of other minds is conceptual: why do I so much as think that\nthere are other thinking, feeling beings? Both the conceptual and the\nepistemological problems may be thought to be connected with a more\ngeneral metaphysical problem of understanding what minds and mental\nstates are.\n\nIn analytic philosophy, towards the end of the twentieth century,\ninterest in these problems waned, but there has been a revival of\ninterest in recent years. This is in part due to the fact that\nphilosophers have begun to explore in earnest the possibility that we\ncome by our knowledge of other minds in much the same way that we come\nby our knowledge of objects in the world\u2014by perception. This\npossibility is also explored in phenomenology and in recent times\nphilosophers schooled in both the analytic and phenomenological\ntraditions have contributed to discussion of this topic. Whatever\naccount one gives of this knowledge, what must be remembered is that\nthe thoughts and feelings I want to know about are the thoughts and\nfeelings of\n another.[1]\n\nSome philosophers who consider this problem have found inspiration\neven further afield, in the texts of classical Indian philosophers.\nThere is much in the texts of Buddhist philosophers, as well as in the\nwriting of their opponents, on the topic of the self and the existence\nof others. More recently, philosophical interest in other minds has\nalso been stimulated by work in psychology and neuroscience. A more\nnaturalistic turn in philosophy has led to questions concerning our\nunderstanding of others. One might see this work as leaving behind\ntraditional epistemological concerns with radical scepticism,\naddressing instead the question of how we go about ascribing mental\nstates to others\u2014a question that can be asked not just of adult\nhumans, but of infants (when and how do they come to ascribe mental\nstates to others), and also of other, non-human, animals. Furthermore,\none can consider the possibility of a deficit in the capacity to\nattribute minds to others and how this might manifest itself in, for\nexample, autism.\n",
