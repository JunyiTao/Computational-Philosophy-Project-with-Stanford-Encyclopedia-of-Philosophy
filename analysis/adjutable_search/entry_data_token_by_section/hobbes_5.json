    "main_text": "Mind and Language || Reasoning as Computation\n2.4 Reasoning as Computation\n\nHobbes describes reasoning as computation, and offers sketches of the\ncomputation that he thinks is going on when we reason. This idea might\nappear to have significant connections to later views, both to some\nviews of Leibniz\u2019s and to more recent approaches that adopt a\ncomputational theory of mind. This section looks at Hobbes\u2019s\npresentation of the idea, and then briefly at these two possible\nconnections.\n\nIn De Corpore Hobbes first describes the view that reasoning\nis computation early in chapter one. \u201cBy reasoning\u201d, he\nsays \u201cI understand computation. And to compute is to collect\nthe sum of many things added together at the same time, or to know the\nremainder when one thing has been taken from another. To reason\ntherefore is the same as to add or to\nsubtract\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 1.2). In the section that follows,\nHobbes gives some initial examples of addition in reasoning, which are\nexamples of adding ideas together to form more complex ones. Thus\n\u201cfrom the conceptions of a quadrilateral figure, an equilateral\nfigure, and a rectangular figure the conception of a square is\ncomposed\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 1.3). That\u2019s but a small part of\nour mental activity though. Hobbes also describes propositions and\nsyllogisms as sorts of addition:\n\n\na syllogism is nothing other than a collection of a sum which is made\nfrom two propositions (through a common term which is called a middle\nterm) conjoined to one another; and thus a syllogism is an addition of\nthree names, just as a proposition is of two (Hobbes 1655, 4.6).\n\n\nA proposition is in a sense formed by adding the name of the predicate\nto the name of the subject, so by adding \u2018snow\u2019 and\n\u2018white\u2019 we get \u2018snow is white\u2019. (We add\n\u2018is\u2019 as well, but as Hobbes argues, it\u2019s not\nnecessary, for we could indicate the same thing by word order rather\nthan having an extra word as the copula.) In thinking about\nsyllogisms, think about the example \u201cEvery man is an animal;\nevery animal is a body; therefore every man is a body\u201d (Hobbes\n1655, 4.4). In some sense we add the propositions, or at least bits of\nthem: we add the subject of the first proposition to the predicate of\nthe second, aided in this by the middle term. \n\nThis is an intriguing suggestion, but seems not to be very far\ndeveloped. This addition has to follow some rules, especially in the\nsyllogistic case. As Hobbes says, \u201cEvery man is an animal; some\nanimal is a quadruped; therefore, some man is a quadruped\u201d is\n\u201cdefective\u201d (Hobbes 1655, 4.4). But its conclusion too\ninvolves the addition of parts of the premises. Presumably syllogistic\naddition, like arithmetic addition, must have its rules. And of\ncourse, Hobbes was aware of the properties of various good and bad\narguments. But it\u2019s not clear what he added to that discussion\nby bringing in the language of addition. Nor, indeed, is it clear what\nhe really added to his discussion of the workings of the mind by his\noccasional use of such language.\n\nNevertheless, the notion that reasoning is computation has been\nreferred back to more than once. Leibniz explicitly endorsed and\ndeveloped it in one early work: \u201cThomas Hobbes, everywhere a\nprofound examiner of principles, rightly stated that everything done\nby our mind is a computation, by which is to be understood\neither the addition of a sum or the subtraction of a difference\n\u2026 So just as there are two primary signs of algebra and\nanalytics, + and \u2212, in the same way there are as it were two\ncopulas, \u2018is\u2019 and \u2018is not\u2019\u201d (Leibniz\n1666, 3). And the idea appears to have continued to hold some appeal\nfor him. Thus for example Leibniz\u2019s numerical characteristic\n(Leibniz 1679) attempts in another way to use the language of addition\nand subtraction to explain aspects of reasoning.\n\nMuch more recently, some philosophers discussing the computational\ntheory of mind have also seen connections to Hobbes\u2019s idea. The\ncentral idea of a modern computational theory of mind is that the mind\nis a sort of computer. More precisely and technically, \u201cthe\nimmediately implementing mechanisms for intentional laws are\ncomputational \u2026 [Computations] viewed in intension,\nare mappings from symbols under syntactic description to symbols under\nsyntactic description\u201d (Fodor 1994, 8). And very roughly, we\nmight see Hobbes as saying the same thing. There are various mental\nprocesses (compounding ideas, forming propositions, reasoning\nsyllogistically) that we can describe without knowing that reasoning\nis computation. But the underlying process that\u2019s making this\nall work is computation, namely, addition and subtraction. The\nconnections seem to amount to no more than that though, so it\u2019s\nat least rather over-dramatic to say that Hobbes was\n\u201cprophetically launching Artificial Intelligence\u201d\n(Haugeland 1985, 23).\n",
