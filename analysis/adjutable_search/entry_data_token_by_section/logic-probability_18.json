    "main_text": "First-order Probability Logic || Possible World First-order Probability Logic\n5.3 Metalogic\n\nGenerally it is hard to provide proof systems for first-order\nprobability logics, because the validity problem for these logics is\ngenerally undecidable. It is even not the case, as it is the case in\nclassical first-order logic, that if an inference is valid, then one\ncan find out in finite time (see Abadi and Halpern (1994)).\n\nNonetheless there are many results for first-order probability logic.\nFor instance, Hoover (1978) and Keisler (1985) study completeness\nresults. Bacchus (1990) and Halpern (1990) also provide complete\naxiomatizations as well as combinations of first-order probability\nlogics and possible-world first-order probability logics respectively.\nIn Ognjanovi\u0107 and Ra\u0161kovi\u0107 (2000), an infinitary\ncomplete axiomatization is given for a more general version of the\npossible-world first-order probability logic presented here.\n",
