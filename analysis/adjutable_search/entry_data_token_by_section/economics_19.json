    "main_text": "Influential approaches to economic methodology || Case studies\n4.5 Case studies\n\nThe above survey of approaches to the fundamental problems of\nappraising economic theory is far from complete. For example, there\nhave been substantial efforts to apply structuralist views of\nscientific theories (Sneed 1971, Stegm\u00fcller 1976, 1979) to\neconomics (Stegm\u00fcller et al. 1981, Hamminga 1983, Hands 1985c,\nBalzer and Hamminga 1989). The above discussion documents the\ndiversity and disagreements concerning how to interpret and appraise\neconomic theories. It is not surprising that there is no consensus\namong those writing on economic methodology concerning the overall\nempirical appraisal of specific approaches in economics, including\nmainstream microeconomics, macroeconomics, and econometrics. When\npractitioners cannot agree, it is questionable whether those who know\nmore philosophy but less economics will be able to settle the matter.\nSince the debates continue, those who reflect on economic methodology\nshould have a continuing part to play.\n\nMeanwhile, there are many other more specific methodological questions\nto address, and it is a sign of the maturity of the subdiscipline that\na large and increasing percentage of work on economic methodology\naddresses more specific questions. There is plethora of work, as a\nperusal of any recent issue of the Journal of Economic\nMethodology or Economics and Philosophy will confirm.\nSome of the range of issues currently under discussion were mentioned\nabove in\n Section 2.\n Here is a list of three of the many areas of current interest:\n\n1. Although more concerned with the content of economics than with its\nmethodology, the recent explosion of work on feminist economics is\nshot through with methodological and sociological self-reflection. The\nfact that a considerably larger percentage of economists are men than\nis true of any of the other social sciences and indeed than most of\nthe natural sciences raises questions about whether there is something\nparticularly masculine about the discipline. Important texts are\nFerber and Nelson (1993, 2003), Nelson (1995, 1996, 2001), Barker and\nKuiper (2003). Since 1995, there has been a journal, Feminist\nEconomics, which pulls together much of this work.\n\n2. During the past decades, laboratory experimentation in economics\nhas expanded rapidly. Laboratory experimentation has many different\nobjectives (see Roth 1988) and apparently holds out the prospect of\nbridging the gulf between fundamental economic theory and empirical\nevidence. Some of it casts light on the way in which methodological\ncommitments influence the extent to which economists heed empirical\nevidence. A good deal of laboratory experimentation in contemporary\neconomics is in the service of behavioral economics, which prides\nitself on heeding experimental evidence concerning the structure and\ndeterminants of individual choices. Although behavioral economics has\nsecured a foothold within mainstream economics, it remains\ncontroversial substantively and methodologically, and its implications\nfor normative economics, discussed below in section 6, are\ncontroversial.\n\nFor example, in the case of preference reversals, discussed briefly\nbelow in Section 5.1, economists devoted considerable attention to the\nexperimental findings and conceded that they disconfirmed central\nprinciples of economics. But economists have been generally unwilling\nto pay serious attention to the theories proposed by psychologists\nthat predicted the phenomena before they were observed. The reason\nseems to be that these psychological theories do not have the same\nwide scope as the basic principles of mainstream economics (Hausman\n1992, chapter 13). Hesitation concerning neuroeconomics (Camerer\net al. 2005, Camerer 2009, Marchionni and Vromen 2014,\nRustichini 2005, 2009, Glimcher and Fehr 2013, Reuter and Montag 2016,\nVromen and Marchionni 2018) is also common. In an extremely\ninfluential essay, \u201cThe Case for Mindless Economics.\u201d Gul\nand Pesandorfer (2008) argue that the findings of behavioral economics\n(and neuroeconomics) are irrelevant to economics. They are at most of\nheuristic value. They maintain that the findings of behavioral\neconomics are irrelevant to economics, because they do not concern\nmarket choices and their consequences, which are the only germane\ndata. Sometimes Gul and Pesandorfer appear to identify economic theory\nwith the empirical\nconsequences economists are concerned with, while at other points they\necho Milton Friedman (see section 3.2) and deny that the\n\u201crealism\u201d of the \u201cassumptions\u201d of economic\nmodels matters. They do not address sophisticated defenses of realism\nconcerning mental states like Dietrich and List (2016). It seems to me\nthat theoretical resistance to engaging\nwith behavioral economists like that one finds in Gul and\nPesandorfer\u2019s essay is weakening. But it is clear that the\nmethodological commitments governing theoretical economics are much\nmore complex and more specific to economics than the general rules\nproposed by philosophers such as Popper and Lakatos.\n\nThe relevance of laboratory experimentation remains controversial.\nBehavioral economists are enthusiastic, while more traditional\ntheorists question whether experimental findings can be generalized to\nnon-experimental contexts and, more generally, concerning the\npossibilities of learning from experiments (Caplin and Schotter 2008).\nFor discussions of experimental economics, see Guala (2000a, b, 2005),\nHey (1991), Kagel and Roth (1995, 2016), Plott (1991), Smith (1991),\nStarmer (1999), Camerer (2003), Bardsley and Cubitt 2009, Durlauf and\nBlume (2009), Branas-Garza and Cabrales (2015), Fr\u00e9chette and\nSchotter (2015), Jacquemet and L\u2019Haridon (2018), and the June,\n2005 special issue of the Journal of Economic Methodology. Al\nRoth\u2019s Game Theory, Experimental Economics, and Market Design\nPage (http://kuznets.fas.harvard.edu/~aroth/alroth.html) is a useful\nsource. For recent work on behavioral economics see the Journal of\nBehavioral Economics, the Review of Behavioral\nEconomics, and Behavioural Public Policy.\n\n3. During the past generation, there has been a radical transformation\nin the attitudes of economists toward empirical causal inquiry,\nespecially in the form of field experiments and natural experiments,\noften employing instrumental variables. For example, about two-thirds\nof the articles in the February, 2018 American Economic\nReview are based on empirical studies. The titles of the first\nfour entries in the table of contents are: \u201cThe Effects of\nPretrial Detention on Conviction, Future Crime, and Employment:\nEvidence from Randomly Assigned Judges,\u201d \u201cImplications of\nUS Tax Policy for House Prices, Rents, and Homeownership,\u201d\n\u201cThe Welfare Cost of Perceived Policy Uncertainty: Evidence from\nSocial Security,\u201d \u201cThe Economic Consequences of Hospital\nAdmissions.\u201d If one goes back twenty-five years, only about\none-eighth of the first issue of the 1993 American Economic\nReview appear to rely on any empirical studies. The first four\nentries are: \u201cToday\u2019s Task for Economists,\u201d\n\u201cTrigger Points and Budget Cuts: Explaining the Effects of\nFiscal Austerity,\u201d \u201cEconomic Policy, Economic Performance,\nand Elections,\u201d \u201cThe Macroeconomics of Dr.\nStrangelove.\u201d A Rip Van Winkle who had gone to sleep in 1983\nreading the principal economics journals would be staggered when he\nawoke in 2018.\n\nField experiments have been especially important in development\neconomics where the results of various foreign aid projects have too\noften provided meagre benefits. One can find good introductions to\nthis work in Carpenter et al. (2005), Duflo and Banerjee\n(2011, 2017), Gugerty and Karlan (2018), Karlan and Appel (2011,\n2016), Kremer and Glennerster (2011), List and Samek (2018), and\nMullainathan and Shafir (2013). See also the\n Poverty Action Lab.\n Although field experiments appear to be hard-nosed inquiries that\nestablish what works and what does not work, matters are not so simple\n(Deaton 2010, Cartwright and Hardie 2013). Without knowledge of the\nmechanisms, it is all too easy for an intervention that works\nsplendidly at a specific time and place to fail abysmally when tried\nelsewhere. Atheoretical inquiry, even when methodologically\nsophisticated, has severe limits as a tactic of knowledge\nacquisition.\n\nThe empirical turn in economics has also had the effect of increasing\nthe importance of economic history. With some ingenuity, especially in\nidentifying possible instrumental variables, history is full of\n\u201cnatural experiments.\u201d For example (J. Hausman 2016), in\n1936, the American Congress voted to pay pensions to veterans of World\nWar I eight years before they were due to be paid. Because the\npercentages of veterans differed across states, Hausman can use the\ndiffering economic performances of states to estimate the effects of\nthe economic stimulus the pensions provided. Although less decisive\nthan randomized controlled trials (which are often impossible to carry\nout), examination of historical episodes such as this one provide\nsignificant evidence concerning economic hypotheses.\n",
