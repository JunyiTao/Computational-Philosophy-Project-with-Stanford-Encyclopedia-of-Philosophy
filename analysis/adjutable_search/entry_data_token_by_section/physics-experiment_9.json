Experiment and Observation\n\nThe distinction between observation and experiment is relatively\nlittle discussed in philosophical literature, despite its continuous\nrelevance to the scientific community and beyond in understanding\nspecific traits and segments of the scientific process and the\nknowledge it produces.\n\nDaston and her coauthors (Daston 2011; Daston and Lunbeck 2011; Daston\nand Galison 2007) have convincingly demonstrated that the distinction\nhas played a role in delineating various features of scientific\npractice. It has helped scientists articulate their reflections on\ntheir own practice.\n\nObservation is philosophically a loaded term, yet the epistemic status\nof scientific observation has evolved gradually with the advance of\nscientific techniques of inquiry and the scientific communities\npursuing them. Daston succinctly summarizes this evolution in the\nfollowing passage:\n\nCharacteristic of the emergent epistemic genre of the observations\nwas, first, an emphasis on singular events, witnessed first hand\n(autopsia) by a named author (in contrast to the accumulation of\nanonymous data over centuries described by Cicero and Pliny as typical\nof observationes); second, a deliberate effort to separate observation\nfrom conjecture (in contrast to the medieval Scholastic connection of\nobservation with the conjectural sciences, such as astrology); and\nthird, the creation of virtual communities of observers dispersed over\ntime and space, who communicated and pooled their observations in\nletters and publications (in contrast to passing them down from father\nto son or teacher to student as rare and precious treasures). (2011,\n81)\n\n\nObservation gradually became juxtaposed to other, more complex modes\nof inquiry such as experiment, \u201cwhose meaning shifted from the\nbroad and heterogeneous sense of experimentum as recipe, trial, or\njust common experience to a concertedly artificial manipulation, often\nusing special instruments and designed to probe hidden causes\u201d\n(Daston 2011, 82).\n\nIn the 17th century, observation and experiment were seen as \u201can\ninseparable pair\u201d (Daston 2011, 82) and by the 19th century they\nwere understood to be essentially opposed, with the observer\nincreasingly seen as passive and thus epistemically inferior to the\nexperimenter. In fact, already Leibniz anticipated this view stating\nthat \u201c[t]here are certain experiments that would be better\ncalled observations, in which one considers rather than produces the\nwork\u201d (Daston 2011, 86). This aspect of the distinction has been\na mainstay of understanding scientific practice ever since.\n\nShapere (1982) pointed out that the usage of the notion of observation\nis embedded in scientific practice, including testing and\njustification of scientific theories. Neutrinos arriving from the Sun\nare said to be observed in the detector but are also said to be an\nobservation of the Sun\u2019s core. Yet, the background knowledge\nprovides the foundation for a meaningful distinction. One the one hand\nthere are weakly interacting neutrinos leaving the Sun\u2019s core\nand entering detector practically interrupted. This may be justifiably\nqualified as \u201cdirect observation\u201d of the Sun\u2019s core.\nOn the other hand, there is a rather indirect observation of the core\nvia detection of light-photons that travel for billions of years from\nthe Sun\u2019s core through the plasma to the electromagnetic\ndetectors.\n\nThere are currently two prominent and opposed views of the\nexperiment-observation distinction. Ian Hacking has characterized it\nas well-defined, while avoiding the claim that observation and\nexperiment are opposites (Hacking 1983, 173). According to him, the\nnotions signify different things in scientific practice. The\nexperiment is a thorough manipulation that creates a new phenomenon,\nand observation of the phenomenon is its outcome. If scientists can\nmanipulate a domain of nature to such an extent that they can create a\nnew phenomenon in a lab, a phenomenon that normally cannot be observed\nin nature, then they have truly observed the phenomenon (Hacking 1989,\n1992).\n\nMeanwhile, other authors concur that \u201cthe familiar distinction\nbetween observation and experiment \u2026 [is] an artefact of the\ndisembodied, reconstructed character of retrospective accounts\u201d\n(Gooding 1992, 68). The distinction \u201ccollapses\u201d when we\nare faced with actual scientific practice as a process, and\n\u201cHacking\u2019s observation versus experiment framework does\nnot survive intact when put to the test in a range of cases of\nscientific experimentation\u201d (Malik 2017, 85). First, the uses of\nthe distinction cannot be compared across scientific fields. And\nsecond, as Gooding (1992) suggests, observation is a process too, not\nsimply a static result of manipulation. Thus, both observation and\nexperiment are seen as concurrent processes blended together in\nscientific practice.\n\nMalik (2017, 86) states that these arguments are the reason why\n\u201cvery few [authors] use Hacking\u2019s nomenclature of\nobservation/experiment\u201d and goes so far to conclude that\n\u201cto (try to) distinguish between observation and experiment is\nfutile.\u201d There is no point delineating the two except perhaps in\ncertain narrow domains; e.g., Hacking\u2019s notion of the experiment\nbased on creating phenomena might be useful within a narrow domain of\nparticle physics. (See also Chang 2011.) He advocates avoiding the\ndistinction altogether and opting for \u201cthe terminology [that]\nunderlines this sense of continuousness\u201d (Malik 2017, 88)\ninstead. If we want to analyze scientific practice, the argument goes,\nwe should leave behind the idea of the distinction as fundamental and\nturn to the characterization and analysis of various \u201cepistemic\nactivities\u201d instead, e.g., along the lines suggested by Chang\n(2011).\n\nA rather obvious danger of this approach is an over-emphasis on the\ncontinuousness of the notions of observation and experiment that\nresults in inadvertent equivocation. And this, in turn, results in\nsidelining the distinction and its subtleties in the analysis of the\nscientific practice, despite their crucial role in articulating and\ndeveloping that practice since the 17th century. It is possible\nthat these two notions form a continuum spreading along the axes of\nmanipulability and accessibility of both target phenomena and\nobservational conditions, and that the key points on such continuum\ndefine various evolving practices. Thus, each scientific practice may\nbe located on the continuum, with the location defining both its\nepistemic properties and the epistemic (as well as ethical)\nobligations that underlie it at a given time. (Perovi\u0107 2021)\n\nOn the one hand, the extent of the manipulation of phenomena and\nresearch conditions ranges from bodily manipulations  (e.g.\nfinding a convenient location to observe a planet with the naked eye)\nto the production of new phenomena in an elaborate apparatus like LHC\nat CERN, where the label \u201cexperiment\u201d aims to delineate a\nsubstantial threshold of manipulation. On the other hand, depending on\nthe background knowledge and aims of the research, observational\naccessibility ranges from mere detection of a potentially interesting\nphenomenon (e.g. a metal detector detects something in the ground),\nall the way to direct observation of the phenomenon\u2019s properties\n(e.g., the microscopic analysis of a metal object).\n",
