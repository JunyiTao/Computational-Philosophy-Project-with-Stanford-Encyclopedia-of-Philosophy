    "main_text": "Some kinds of truth definition on the 1933 pattern || The truth definition by quantifier elimination\n2.2 The truth definition by quantifier elimination\n\nThe remaining truth definition in Tarski\u2019s 1933 paper \u2013\nthe third as they appear in the paper \u2013 is really a bundle of\nrelated truth definitions, all for the same object language \\(L\\) but\nin different interpretations. The quantifiers of \\(L\\) are assumed to\nrange over a particular class, call it \\(A\\); in fact they are second\norder quantifiers, so that really they range over the collection of\nsubclasses of \\(A\\). The class \\(A\\) is not named explicitly in the\nobject language, and thus one can give separate truth definitions for\ndifferent values of \\(A\\), as Tarski proceeds to do. So for this\nsection of the paper, Tarski allows one and the same sentence to be\ngiven different interpretations; this is the exception to the general\nclaim that his object language sentences are fully interpreted. But\nTarski stays on the straight and narrow: he talks about\n\u2018truth\u2019 only in the special case where \\(A\\) is the class\nof all individuals. For other values of \\(A\\), he speaks not of\n\u2018truth\u2019 but of \u2018correctness in the domain\n\\(A\\)\u2019.\n\nThese truth or correctness definitions don\u2019t fall out of a\ndefinition of satisfaction. In fact they go by a much less direct\nroute, which Tarski describes as a \u2018purely accidental\u2019\npossibility that relies on the \u2018specific peculiarities\u2019 of\nthe particular object language. It may be helpful to give a few more\nof the technical details than Tarski does, in a more familiar notation\nthan Tarski\u2019s, in order to show what is involved. Tarski refers\nhis readers to a paper of Thoralf Skolem in 1919 for the\ntechnicalities.\n\nOne can think of the language \\(L\\) as the first-order language with\npredicate symbols \\(\\subseteq\\) and =. The language is interpreted as\ntalking about the subclasses of the class \\(A\\). In this language we\ncan define:\n\n\u2018\\(x\\) is the empty set\u2019 (viz. \\(x \\subseteq\\) every\nclass).\n\u2018\\(x\\) is an atom\u2019 (viz. \\(x\\) is not empty, but every\nsubclass of \\(x\\) not equal to \\(x\\) is empty).\n\u2018\\(x\\) has exactly \\(k\\) members\u2019 (where \\(k\\) is a\nfinite number; viz. there are exactly \\(k\\) distinct atoms \\(\\subseteq\nx)\\).\n\u2018There are exactly \\(k\\) elements in \\(A\\)\u2019 (viz.\nthere is a class with exactly \\(k\\) members, but there is no class\nwith exactly \\(k+1\\) members).\n\n\nNow we aim to prove: \n\nLemma. Every formula \\(F\\) of \\(L\\) is equivalent to (i.e. is\nsatisfied by exactly the same assignments as) some boolean combination\nof sentences of the form \u2018There are exactly \\(k\\) elements in\n\\(A\\)\u2019 and formulas of the form \u2018There are exactly \\(k\\)\nelements that are in \\(v_1\\), not in \\(v_2\\), not in \\(v_3\\) and in\n\\(v_4\\)\u2019 (or any other combination of this type, using only\nvariables free in \\(F)\\). \n\nThe proof is by induction on the complexity of formulas. For atomic\nformulas it is easy. For boolean combinations of formulas it is easy,\nsince a boolean combination of boolean combinations is again a boolean\ncombination. For formulas beginning with \\(\\forall\\), we take the\nnegation. This leaves just one case that involves any work, namely the\ncase of a formula beginning with an existential quantifier. By\ninduction hypothesis we can replace the part after the quantifier by a\nboolean combination of formulas of the kinds stated. So a typical case\nmight be:\n\n\\(\\exists z\\) (there are exactly two elements that are in \\(z\\) and\n\\(x\\) and not in \\(y)\\). \n\nThis holds if and only if there are at least two elements that are in\n\\(x\\) and not in \\(y\\). We can write this in turn as: The number of\nelements in \\(x\\) and not in \\(y\\) is not 0 and is not 1; which is a\nboolean combination of allowed formulas. The general proof is very\nsimilar but more complicated.\n\nWhen the lemma has been proved, we look at what it says about a\nsentence. Since the sentence has no free variables, the lemma tells us\nthat it is equivalent to a boolean combination of statements saying\nthat \\(A\\) has a given finite number of elements. So if we know how\nmany elements \\(A\\) has, we can immediately calculate whether the\nsentence is \u2018correct in the domain \\(A\\)\u2019.\n\nOne more step and we are home. As we prove the lemma, we should gather\nup any facts that can be stated in \\(L\\), are true in every domain,\nand are needed for proving the lemma. For example we shall almost\ncertainly need the sentence saying that \\(\\subseteq\\) is transitive.\nWrite \\(T\\) for the set of all these sentences. (In Tarski\u2019s\npresentation \\(T\\) vanishes, since he is using higher order logic and\nthe required statements about classes become theorems of logic.) Thus\nwe reach, for example:\n\nTheorem. If the domain \\(A\\) is infinite, then a sentence\n\\(S\\) of the language \\(L\\) is correct in \\(A\\) if and only if \\(S\\)\nis deducible from \\(T\\) and the sentences saying that the number of\nelements of \\(A\\) is not any finite number. \n\nThe class of all individuals is infinite (Tarski asserts), so\nthe theorem applies when \\(A\\) is this class. And in this case Tarski\nhas no inhibitions about saying not just \u2018correct in\n\\(A\\)\u2019 but \u2018true\u2019; so we have our truth\ndefinition.\n\nThe method we have described revolves almost entirely around removing\nexistential quantifiers from the beginnings of formulas; so it is\nknown as the method of quantifier elimination. It is not as\nfar as you might think from the two standard definitions. In all cases\nTarski assigns to each formula, by induction on the complexity of\nformulas, a description of the class of assignments that satisfy the\nformula. In the two previous truth definitions this class is described\ndirectly; in the quantifier elimination case it is described in terms\nof a boolean combination of formulas of a simple kind.\n\nAt around the same time as he was writing the 1933 paper, Tarski gave\na truth definition by quantifier elimination for the first-order\nlanguage of the field of real numbers. In his 1931 paper it appears\nonly as an interesting way of characterising the set of relations\ndefinable by formulas. Later he gave a fuller account, emphasising\nthat his method provided not just a truth definition but an algorithm\nfor determining which sentences about the real numbers are true and\nwhich are false.\n",
