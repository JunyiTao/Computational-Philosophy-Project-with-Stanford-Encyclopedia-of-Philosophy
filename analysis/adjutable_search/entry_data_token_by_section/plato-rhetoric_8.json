    "main_text": "Phaedrus || Rhetoric in the Phaedrus\n5.1 Rhetoric in the Phaedrus\n\nThe second \u201chalf\u201d of the dialogue does not discuss the\nnature of love thematically, at any length, but it does in effect\npropose that discourse prompted by the love of\nwisdom\u2014philosophy\u2014is true rhetoric. As the conversation\nbetween one \u201clover of speeches\u201d (228c1\u20132) and\nanother evolves, the three rhetorical speeches of the first part of\nthe dialogue are examined from the perspective of their rhetorical\nartlessness or artfulness. Poetry is once again cast as a kind of\nspeech making (258b3) and, very importantly, Socrates declares that\n\u201cIt\u2019s not speaking or writing well that\u2019s shameful; what\u2019s\nreally shameful is to engage in either of them shamefully or\nbadly\u201d\n (258d4\u20135).[28]\n The proffering of discourses is not in and of itself shameful; what\nthen constitutes honorable speech making?\n\nThe answer to this crucial question constitutes one of the most famous\ncontributions to the topic. In essence, Socrates argues that someone\nwho is going to speak well and nobly must know the truth about the\nsubject he is going to discuss. The sort of theory Polus and Callicles\nmaintained in the Gorgias is false (see Phaedrus\n259e4\u2013260a4). In order to make good on this sweeping claim,\nSocrates argues that rhetoric is an \u201cart\u201d (techne), and\nnot just artless practice (the equivalent of the\n\u201cempeiria\u201d for which rhetoric was condemned in the\nGorgias). How to show that it is an art after all? Quite a\nnumber of claimants to rhetoric are named and reviewed, and readers\nwho have an interest in the history of Greek rhetoric rightly find\nthese passages invaluable. We are told here that the extant manuals of\nrhetoric offer the \u201cpreliminaries\u201d to the true art of\nrhetoric, not the thing itself (269b7\u20138).\n\nMany rhetoricians have artfully and effectively misled their\naudiences, and Socrates argues\u2014somewhat implausibly\nperhaps\u2014that in order to mislead one cannot oneself be\n misled.[29]\n An artful speech exhibits its artfulness in its structure, one\nthat\u2014since in the best case it embodies the truth\u2014retraces\nor mirrors the natural divisions of the subject matter itself. It will\nnot only be coherent, but structured in a way that mirrors the way the\nsubject itself is naturally organized. In one of Socrates\u2019 most famous\nimages, a good composition should exhibit the organic unity of a\nliving creature, \u201cwith a body of its own; it must be neither\nwithout head nor without legs; and it must have a middle and\nextremities that are fitting both to one another and to the whole\nwork\u201d (264c1\u20135). This will not be truly accomplished if it\nonly looks that way; to be that way, a discourse\u2019s\nunity should reflect the unity of its subject.\n\nAt this point we might want to ask about the audience; after\nall, the rhetorician is trying to persuade someone of something. Might\nnot the speaker know the truth of the matter, and know how to embody\nit artfully in a composition, but fail to persuade anyone of it? Would\nnot a failure to persuade indicate that the speaker lacks the complete\nart of rhetoric? Socrates in effect responds to this question by\npostulating that the successful speaker must also know the nature of\nthe human soul, else his skill is just \u201cempeiria\u201d (the\nterm from the Gorgias again) rather than \u201ctechne\u201d\n(270b6). Just as an expert physician must understand both the human\nbody and the body of medical knowledge\u2014these being\ninseparable\u2014so too the expert speaker must understand both the\nhuman soul and what is known about the soul. The reader will\nimmediately recall that the great speech (the palinode) in the first\nhalf of the Phaedrus was about the soul in its cosmic\ncontext\u2014the soul\u2019s nature, its journeys divine and human, its\nlongings, the objects of its longings, its failures and their\nconsequences, were all part of the same story. Thus it is not\nsurprising that when defining the art of rhetoric Socrates suggests\nthat we cannot \u201creach a serious understanding of the nature of\nthe soul without understanding the nature of the world as a\nwhole\u201d (270c1\u20132). The consequence of this approach to\nrhetoric has now become clear: to possess that art, one must be a\nphilosopher. True rhetoric is philosophical discourse.\n\nBut what happened to the question about the audience? \u201cThe\nsoul\u201d is not the addressee of a rhetorical discourse. Socrates\nresponds that the artful rhetorician must also know what the types of\nsoul are, what sorts of speeches \u201cwork\u201d on each type, and\nbe able to identify which type is being addressed on the given\noccasion. This last demand is a matter of practice and of the ability\nto size up the audience on the spot, as it were. The requirements of\nthe true art of rhetoric, which Socrates also calls the \u201cart of\ndialectic\u201d (276e5\u20136), are very high indeed. (The reader\nwill find them summarized at 277b5\u2013c6).\n\nIf the audience is philosophical, or includes philosophers, how would\nthe true, artful, philosophical dialectician address it? This question\nis not faced head-on in the Phaedrus, but we are given a\nnumber of clues. They are introduced by means of a myth\u2014by a\nkind of \u201cpoetry,\u201d if you will\u2014and they help us\nunderstand the sort of discourse a philosopher will on the whole wish\nto avoid, namely that which is written. According to\nreflections inaugurated by the Theuth and Thamus myth, the written\nword is not the most suitable vehicle for communicating truth, because\nit cannot answer questions put to it; it simply repeats itself when\nqueried; it tends to substitute the authority of the author for the\nreader\u2019s open minded inquiry into the truth; and it circulates\neverywhere indiscriminately, falling into the hands of people who\ncannot understand it. Very importantly, it interferes with true\n\u201crecollection\u201d (anamnesis, 249c2), that process\ndescribed at length and (for the most part) poetically in the\ndialogue\u2019s \u201cpalinode,\u201d by which the knowledge latent in\nthe soul is brought out through question and answer (274d-275b).\nWriting is a clumsy medium, and thus would not match the potential\neffectiveness of philosophical give and take, the \u201cSocratic\ndialogue\u201d which best leads the philosophical mind to truth. This\ndesirable rhetoric is \u201ca discourse that is written down, with\nknowledge, in the soul of the listener; it can defend itself, and it\nknows for whom it should speak and for whom it should remain\nsilent\u201d (276a5\u20137). Dialectical speech is accompanied by\nknowledge, can defend itself when questioned, and is productive of\nknowledge in its audience (276e4\u2013277a4). Of course, all this\nraises the question as to the status of Plato\u2019s dialogues, since they\nare themselves writings; we will return to it briefly below.\n\nRhetoric is the art of \u201cdirecting the soul by means of\nspeech\u201d (261a8). Popular rhetoric is not an art, but a knack for\npersuasion. Artful rhetoric requires philosophy; but does philosophy\nrequire rhetoric? Why must philosophical discourse\u2014say, as\nexemplified in \u201cSocratic dialogue\u201d\u2014have anything to\ndo with rhetoric? The Phaedrus points to the interesting\nthought that all discourse is rhetorical, even when the\nspeaker is simply trying to communicate the truth\u2014indeed, true\nrhetoric is the art of communicating the truth (notice the broad sweep\nof the discussion of discourse at 277e5\u2013278b4). Rhetoric is\npresent wherever and whenever people speak (261d10\u2013e4 and context).\nEven when one is not sure what the truth is, and even when one is\nthinking through something by oneself\u2014carrying on an inner\ndialogue, as it were\u2014discourse and persuasion are\n present.[30]\n Of course, a philosopher will question assertions that he or she\nought to persuaded of X; but that questioning too, the\nPhaedrus suggests, is part of a process aimed at warranted\npersuasion, and inevitably involves a mix of the\n\u201cpersuadability\u201d of the philosopher on the one hand, and\nthe truth (or falsity) of the claims on the other. The bottom line is\nthat there is no escaping from persuasion, and so none from\nrhetoric\u2014including of course from the very problem of\ndistinguishing between warranted and unwarranted persuasion.\nSelf-deception is an ever-present possibility (as Socrates implies\nhere, and notes at Cratylus 428d). That is a problem about\nwhich the philosopher above all worries about. It is always a question\nof \u201cdirecting the soul by means of speech,\u201d even where\nit\u2019s a matter of the soul directing or leading itself (or to use a\nphrase from earlier in the dialogue, moving itself\n (245e)).[31]\n\nThe Gorgias\u2019 notion that the struggle between (popular)\nrhetoric and philosophy\u2014or as we might say, unphilosophical and\nphilosophical rhetoric\u2014is one between comprehensive outlooks is\nclear from the Phaedrus as well. The \u201cgreat\nspeech\u201d or palinode of the dialogue illustrates the character\nand range of views upon which the project of philosophical rhetoric\n(of philosophy, in short) is built. The speech is quite explicitly a\nretraction of an outlook that does not espouse these views; ordinary\nrhetoric moves in a very different moral, metaphysical, psychological,\nand epistemic world. It is an interesting fact that Plato deploys\ncertain elements of poetry (such as myth, allegory, simile, image) in\ndrawing the contrast between these outlooks.\n",
