    "main_text": "\n\nIn the 1950s, a lively debate broke out among biologists that\ncontinues to this day, over what might seem like the most unlikely of\norganisms: the land snail, Cepaea nemoralis. Yet, there are\nin fact some interesting aspects to C. nemoralis. This\nspecies of snail is polymorphic; the snail\u2019s shell varies in\ncolor (pink, brown, and yellow) as well as the number of visible bands\n(anywhere from 0\u20135). But the colors and bands are not equally\ndistributed across populations. In some populations, pink\npredominates, whereas in others, yellow or brown, and similarly, some\nbanding numbers are more prevalent in some populations than in others.\nThus, not only are there variations within populations (it is rare to\nfind a population that is all one color or where all the snails have\nthe same number of bands), but there are variations between\npopulations. What is the explanation for this distribution of forms?\nThose whose knowledge of evolution familiarized them only with the\ntheory of natural selection might assume, for example, that in the\npopulations where yellow snails were the most prevalent, it was\nbecause they were fitter than the other colors\u2014that there was\nsome environmental factor that favored yellow over brown and pink. And\nthat in the populations where brown snails were the most prevalent,\nthere was some difference in the environment that led them to be\nfavored over yellow and pink snails. But is there some other\nexplanation? Perhaps the distributions are in some sense due to\nchance, perhaps even in a way that can be modeled mathematically. What\nwould that mean, and how would you determine which explanation was\ncorrect? The attempt to develop \u201cchancy\u201d explanations that\nare alternatives (perhaps complementary alternatives) to those due to\nnatural selection is what led biologists to develop models of\ngenetic drift.\n\nGenetic drift (variously called \u201crandom drift\u201d,\n\u201crandom genetic drift\u201d, or sometimes just\n\u201cdrift\u201d) has been a source of ongoing controversy within\nthe philosophy of biology and evolutionary biology communities, to the\nextent that even the question of what drift is has become\ncontroversial. There seems to be agreement that drift is a chance (or\nprobabilistic or statistical) element within population genetics (see\nentry on\n population genetics)\n and within evolutionary biology more generally, and that the term\n\u201crandom\u201d isn\u2019t invoking indeterminism or any\ntechnical mathematical meaning, but that\u2019s about where agreement\nends. Yet genetic drift models are a staple topic in population\ngenetics textbooks and research, with genetic drift described as one\nof the main factors of evolution alongside selection, mutation, and\nmigration. Some claim that genetic drift has played a major role in\nevolution (particularly molecular evolution), while others claim it to\nbe minor. This article will examine these and other controversies.\n\nIn order to break through the logjam of competing definitions of\ndrift, this entry begins with a brief history of the concept, before\nexamining various philosophical claims about the proper\ncharacterization of drift and whether it can be distinguished from\nnatural selection; the relation of drift to debates over\nstatisticalism; whether drift can be detected empirically and if so,\nhow; and the proper understanding of drift as a model and as a\n(purported) law.\n",
