In\ncomputer science, labeled transition systems (LTSs) are commonly used\nto represent possible computation pathways during execution of a\nprogram. LTSs are generalizations of Kripke frames, consisting of a\nset \\(W\\) of states and a collection of \\(i\\)-accessibility relations\n\\(R_i\\), one for each computer process \\(i\\). Intuitively, \\(wR_i w'\\)\nholds exactly when \\(w'\\) is a state that results from applying the\nprocess \\(i\\) to state \\(w\\).\n\nThe language of poly-modal or dynamic logic introduces a collection of\nmodal operators \\(\\Box_i\\), one for each program \\(i\\) (Harel, 1984).\nThen \\(\\Box_i A\\) states that sentence \\(A\\) holds in every result of\napplying \\(i\\). So ideas like the correctness and successful\ntermination of programs can be expressed in this language. Models for\nsuch a language are like Kripke models save that LTSs are used in\nplace of frames. A bisimulation is a counterpart relation\nbetween states of two such models such that exactly the same\npropositional variables are true in counterpart states, and whenever\nworld \\(v\\) is \\(i\\)-accessible from one of two counterpart states,\nthen the other counterpart bears the \\(i\\)-accessibility relation to\nsome counterpart of \\(v\\). In short, the \\(i\\)-accessibility structure\none can \u201csee\u201d from a given state mimics what one sees from\na counterpart. Bisimulation is a weaker notion than isomorphism (a\nbisimulation relation need not be 1-1), but it is sufficient to\nguarantee equivalence in processing.\n\nIn the 70s, bisimulation had already been developed by modal logicians\nto help better understand the relationship between modal logic axioms\nand their corresponding conditions on Kripke frames. Kripke\u2019s\nsemantics provides a basis for translating modal formulas into\nsentences of first-order logic with quantification over possible\nworlds. Replace metavariables \\(A\\) in an axiom with open sentences\n\\(Ax\\), and translate \\(\\Box Ax\\) to \\(\\forall y(Rxy \\rightarrow\nAy)\\), in the result. (The translation for \\(\\Diamond Ax\\) is given by\n\\( \\exists y(Rxy \\amp Ay)\\).) For example, the translation of the\naxiom schema \\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) comes to \\(\\exists y\n(Rxy \\amp \\forall z(Ryz \\rightarrow Az)) \\rightarrow Ax\\). This open\nformula with a free variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 reflects what\n\\(\\Diamond \\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) \u201csays\u201d in the language of\nfirst-order logic. Obviously the translations of modal formulas are\nspecial; most first-order formulas are not equivalent to the result of\ntranslating modal formulas in this way. The modal translations form a\nspecial subset of the predicate logic language, which delimits what\nmodal logic formulas can express. \n\nIs there any interesting way to characterize the expressive power of\nthe modal translations? The answer is that bisimulation serves exactly\nthat purpose. Van Benthem showed (Blackburn et al., 2001, p. 103) that\na first-order formula is equivalent to a modal translation exactly\nwhen its holding in a model entails that it holds in any bisimular\nmodel, and the idea easily generalizes to the poly-modal case. This\nsuggests that poly-modal logic lies at exactly the right level of\nabstraction to describe, and reason about, computation and other\nprocesses. (After all, what really matters there is the preservation\nof truth values of formulas in models, rather than the finer details\nof the frame structures.) Furthermore, the implicit translation of\nmodal logics into well-understood fragments of predicate logic\nprovides a wealth of information of interest to computer scientists.\nAs a result, a fruitful area of research in computer science has\ndeveloped with bisimulation as its core idea (Ponse et al.\n1995).\n14. Frame Validity and Incompleteness\n\nWork on modal logic in the 60s was primarily concerned with obtaining\ncompleteness results with respect to various conditions on the\naccessibility relation. However as research progressed into the 70s,\ndeeper connections were discovered concerning what modal axioms\nexpress about frames. A central idea in this work is the notion of\nframe validity, which differs from the kind of validity which was laid\nout in Section 6 above. There an argument was considered valid for a\nset of conditions \\(C\\) on frames exactly when for every model\n\\(\\langle W, R, v\\rangle\\) whose frame obeys \\(C\\), and every world\n\\(w\\) in \\(W\\), the truth of the premises at \\(w\\) entails the truth\nof the conclusion at \\(w\\). In short, model validity amounts to\npreservation of truth on every model. Frame validity, on the other\nhand, focuses more clearly on the frames of the model. A sentence is\nsaid to be valid on a frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) iff it is\ntrue in every world in any model with frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\).\nThen an argument is ruled frame valid for a set of conditions\n\\(C\\) on frames iff it preserves frame validity, that is, for every\nframe that obeys \\(C\\), if the premises are valid on that frame, then\nso is the conclusion.\n\nFrame validity appears a better way to understand what a modal axiom\nexpresses about frames. There are models that assign the axiom (M):\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) true, even though its frame does not satisfy\nreflexivity - the corresponding frame condition for (M). That is\nbecause the valuation function for a model can be specially crafted so\nthat it does the work of ensuring that \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) is\ntrue. However, as we will soon see, if \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) is\nvalid for frame \\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\), then it follows that\n\\(\\langle W, R\\rangle\\) is reflexive. By abstracting away from details\nabout the valuation function, one obtains better insight into the\nrelationship between axioms and frame conditions.\n\nThe concept of frame validity provides a basis for translating what\nmodal axioms express into sentences of a second-order language where\nquantification is allowed over one-place predicate letters \\(P\\).\nReplace metavariables \\(A\\) with open sentences \\(Px\\), translate\n\\(\\Box Px\\) to \\(\\forall y(Rxy \\rightarrow Py)\\), and close free\nvariables \\(x\\) and predicate letters \\(P\\) with universal\nquantifiers. For example, the predicate logic translation of the axiom\nschema \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) comes to \\(\\forall P \\forall x[\\forall\ny(Rxy\\rightarrow Py) \\rightarrow Px\\)]. (The basis for the\nquantification over the predicate letters P is that frame validity\nquantifies over all valuations of the propositional variables p, but\nvaluations over p are functions from the set of possible worlds to\ntruth values, and these can be likened to properties of worlds\nexpressed by p, namely the property that world w has when p is true\nthere.) \n\nGiven this translation for \\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\), one may\ninstantiate the variable \\(P\\) to an arbitrary one-place predicate,\nfor example to the predicate \\(Rx\\) whose extension is the set of all\nworlds w such that \\(Rxw\\) for a given value of \\(x\\). Then one\nobtains \\(\\forall x[\\forall y(Rxy\\rightarrow Rxy) \\rightarrow Rxx\\)],\nwhich reduces to \\(\\forall xRxx\\), since \\(\\forall y(Rxy\\rightarrow\nRxy)\\) is a tautology. This illuminates the correspondence between\n\\(\\Box A\\rightarrow A\\) and reflexivity of frames \\((\\forall xRxx)\\).\nSimilar results hold for many other axioms and frame conditions. The\n\u201ccollapse\u201d of second-order axiom conditions to first-order\nframe conditions is very helpful in locating how axioms correspond to\nframe conditions, and in obtaining completeness results for various\nmodal logics. For example, this is the core idea behind the elegant\nresults of Sahlqvist (1975), which are described in (Blackburn et al.,\n2001, Ch. 3, especially section 3.6).\n\nThe striking successes along these lines suggests that every modal\nlogic can be shown to be sound and complete with respect to the frame\nconditions that its axioms express. Unfortunately, this is not the\ncase. Some logics are incomplete for their frame conditions as is\nillustrated by the following example (Boolos, 1993 pp. 148ff). The\nprovability logic GL results from adding the axiom \\(\\Box(\\Box\nA\\rightarrow A) \\rightarrow \\Box A\\) to the basic modal logic K.\nSystem H results from adding the weaker axiom: \\(\\Box(\\Box A\n\\leftrightarrow A) \\rightarrow \\Box A\\) to K. GL is stronger than H as\nit is able to prove the standard axiom for S4: \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow\n\\Box\\Box A\\), but H is not. The problem is that GL and H express\nequivalent second-order conditions. That means in turn that H is\nincomplete, for it cannot prove a formula \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow\n\\Box\\Box A\\) which is in fact valid for the frames it expresses.\n\nSo from the frame validity perspective, there is no way to always\nconvert the second-order translation of an axiom into a first-order\nframe condition for which a given system is both sound and complete.\nThe reason is that if there were, both GL and H would have to be sound\nand complete with respect to the same first order condition C. But\nthat means (by soundness of GL) that \\(\\Box A \\rightarrow \\Box\\Box A\\)\nwould be frame valid for C, but not provable in H. The upshot is that\nin general, what modal logics express in the frame-validity paradigm\nmay be more powerful than what can be said in a first-order\nlanguage.\n15. Modal Logic and Games\n\nThe interaction between the theory of games and modal logic is a\nflourishing new area of research (van der Hoek and Pauly, 2007; van\nBenthem, 2011, Ch. 10, and 2014). This work has interesting\napplications to understanding cooperation and competition among agents\nas information available to them evolves. \n\nThe Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma illustrates some of the concepts in game\ntheory that can be analyzed using modal logics. Imagine two players\nthat choose to either cooperate or defect. If both cooperate, they\nboth achieve a reward of 3 points, if they both defect, they both get\n1 point, and if one cooperates and the other defects, the defector\nmakes off with 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. If both\nplayers are altruistic and motivated to maximize the sum of their\nrewards, they will both cooperate, as this is the best they can do\ntogether. However, they are both tempted to defect to increase their\nown reward from 3 to 5, leaving their opponent with nothing. On the\nother hand, if they are both rational, they may recognize that if\ndefection is the best strategy, their opponent will choose this as\nwell, leaving them with only 1 point. So unless there is enough trust\nbetween the players to motivate cooperation, they will be doomed to\nreceiving 1 point apiece. However, if each thinks the other realizes\nthis, they may be willing to risk cooperating anyway.\n\nAn extended (or iterated) version of this game gives the players\nmultiple moves, that is, repeated opportunities to play and collect\nrewards. If players have information about the history of the moves\nand their outcomes, new concerns come into play, as success in the\ngame depends on knowing their opponent\u2019s strategy and\ndetermining (for example) when he/she can be trusted not to defect. In\nmulti-player versions of the game, where players are drawn in pairs\nfrom a larger pool at each move, one\u2019s own best strategy may\nwell depend on whether one can recognize one\u2019s opponents and the\nstrategies they have adopted. (See Grim et. al., 1998 for fascinating\nresearch on Interated Prisoner\u2019s Dilemmas.) \n\nIn games like Chess, players take turns making their moves and their\nopponents can see the moves made. If we adopt the convention that the\nplayers in a game take turns making their moves, then the Iterated\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma is a game with missing information about the\nstate of play \u2013 the player with the second turn lacks\ninformation about what the other player\u2019s last move was. This\nillustrates the interest of games with imperfect information. \n\nThe application of games to logic has a long history. One influential\napplication with important implications for linguistics is Game\nTheoretic Semantics (GTS) (Hintikka et. al. 1983), where validity is\ndefined by the outcome of a game between two players, one trying to\nverify and the other trying to falsify a given formula. GTS has\nsignificantly stronger resources that standard Tarski-style semantics,\nas it can be used (for example) to explain how meaning evolves in a\ndiscourse (a sequence of sentences).\n\nHowever, the work on games and modal logic to be described here is\nsomewhat different. Instead of using games to analyze the semantics of\na logic, the modal logics at issue are used to analyze games. The\nstructure of games and their play is very rich, as it involves the\nnature of the game itself (the allowed moves and the rewards for the\noutcomes), the strategies (which are sequences of moves through time),\nand the flow of information available to the players as the game\nprogresses. Therefore, the development of modal logic for games draws\non features found in logics involving concepts like time, agency,\npreference, goals, knowledge, belief, and cooperation. \n\nTo provide some hint at this variety, here is a limited description of\nsome of the modal operators that turn up in the analysis of games and\nsome of the things that can be expressed with them. The basic idea in\nthe semantics is that a game consists of a set of players 1, 2, 3,\n\u2026, and a set of W of game states. For each player \\(i\\), there\nis an accessibility relation \\(R_i\\) understood so that \\(sR_i t\\)\nholds for states \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) iff when the game has come to state\n\\(s\\) player \\(i\\) has the option of making a move that results in\n\\(t\\). This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches\ndefine every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics\nalso assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So,\nfor example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom \\(\\win_i\\)\nsuch that \\(v(\\win_i, s)=T\\) iff state \\(s\\) is a win for player\n\\(i\\). Model operators \\(\\Box_i\\) and \\(\\Diamond_i\\) for each player\n\\(i\\) may then be given truth conditions as follows. \n\\[\\begin{align*}\nv(\\Box_i A, s) &=T \\text{ iff for all } t \\text{ in } W, \\text{ if } sR_i t, \\text{ then } v(A, t)=T. \\\\\nv(\\Diamond_i A, s) &=T \\text{ iff for some } t \\text{ in } W, sR_i t \\text{ and }v(A, t)=T.\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\nSo \\(\\Box_i A\\) \\((\\Diamond_i A)\\) is true in s provided that sentence\n\\(A\\) holds true in every (some) state that \\(i\\) can chose from state\n\\(s\\). Given that \\(\\bot\\) is a contradiction (so \\({\\sim}\\bot\\) is a\ntautology), \\(\\Diamond_i {\\sim}\\bot\\) is true at a state when it is\n\\(i\\)\u2019s turn to move. For a two-player game \\(\\Box_1\\bot\\) &\n\\(\\Box_2\\bot\\) is true of a state that ends the game, because neither\n1 nor 2 can move. \\(\\Box_1\\Diamond_2\\)win\\(_2\\) asserts that player 1\nhas a loss because whatever 1 does from the present state, 2 can win\nin the following move. \n\nFor a more general account of the player\u2019s payoffs, ordering\nrelations \\(\\leq_i\\) can be defined over the states so that \\(s\\leq_i\nt\\) means that \\(i\\)\u2019s payoff for \\(t\\) is at least as good as\nthat for \\(s\\). Another generalization is to express facts about\nsequences \\(q\\) of moves, by introducing operators interpreted by\nrelations \\(sR_q t\\) indicating that the sequence \\(q\\) starting from\ns eventually arrives at \\(t\\). With these and related resources, it is\npossible to express (for example) that \\(q\\) is \\(i\\)\u2019s best\nstrategy given the present state.\n\nIt is crucial to the analysis of games to have a way to express the\ninformation available to the players. One way to accomplish this is to\nborrow ideas from epistemic logic. Here we may introduce an\naccessibility relation \\({\\sim}_i\\) for each player such that\n\\(s{\\sim}_i t\\) holds iff \\(i\\) cannot distinguish between states\n\\(s\\) and \\(t\\). Then knowledge operators \\(\\rK_i\\) for the players\ncan be defined so that \\(\\rK_i A\\) says at \\(s\\) that \\(A\\) holds in\nall worlds that \\(i\\) cannot distinguish from \\(s\\); that is, despite\n\\(i\\)\u2019s ignorance about the state of play, he/she can still be\nconfident that \\(A\\). \\(\\rK\\) operators may be used to say that player\n1 is in a position to resign, for he knows that 2 sees she has a win:\n\\(\\rK_1 \\rK_2\\Box_1\\Diamond_2\\win_2\\).\n\nSince player\u2019s information varies as the game progresses, it is\nuseful to think of moves of the game as indexed by times, and to\nintroduce operators \\(O\\) and \\(U\\) from tense logic for\n\u2018next\u2019 and \u2018until\u2019. Then \\(K_i OA \\rightarrow\nOK_i A\\) expresses that player \\(i\\) has \u201cperfect recall\u201d,\nthat is, that when \\(i\\) knows that \\(A\\) happens next, then at the\nnext moment \\(i\\) has not forgotten that \\(A\\) has happened. This\nillustrates how modal logics for games can reflect cognitive\nidealizations and a player\u2019s success (or failure) at living up\nto them.\n\nThe technical side of the modal logics for games is challenging. The\nproject of identifying systems of rules that are sound and complete\nfor a language containing a large collection of operators may be\nguided by past research, but the interactions between the variety of\naccessibility relations leads to new concerns. Furthermore, the\ncomputational complexity of various systems and their fragments is a\nlarge landscape largely unexplored.\n\nGame theoretic concepts can be applied in a surprising variety of ways\n\u2013 from checking an argument for validity to succeeding in the\npolitical arena. So there are strong motivations for formulating\nlogics that can handle games. What is striking about this research is\nthe power one obtains by weaving together logics of time, agency,\nknowledge, belief, and preference in a unified setting. The lessons\nlearned from that integration have value well beyond what they\ncontribute to understanding games.\n16. Quantifiers in Modal Logic\n\nIt would seem to be a simple matter to outfit a modal logic with the\nquantifiers \\(\\forall\\) (all) and \\(\\exists\\) (some). One would simply\nadd the standard (or classical) rules for quantifiers to the\nprinciples of whichever propositional modal logic one chooses.\nHowever, adding quantifiers to modal logic involves a number of\ndifficulties. Some of these are philosophical. For example, Quine\n(1953) has famously argued that quantifying into modal contexts is\nsimply incoherent, a view that has spawned a gigantic literature.\nQuine\u2019s complaints do not carry the weight they once did. See\nBarcan (1990) for a good summary, and note Kripke\u2019s (2017)\n(written in the 60\u2019s for a class with Quine) which provides a\nstrong formal argument that there can be nothing wrong with\n\u201cquantifying in\u201d.\n\nA second kind of complication is technical. There is a wide variety in\nthe choices one can make in the semantics for quantified modal logic,\nand the proof that a system of rules is correct for a given choice can\nbe difficult. The work of Corsi (2002) and Garson (2005) goes some way\ntowards bringing unity to this terrain, and Johannesson (2018)\nintroduces constraints that help reduce the number of options;\nnevertheless the situation still remains challenging.\n\nAnother complication is that some logicians believe that modality\nrequires abandoning classical quantifier rules in favor of the weaker\nrules of free logic (Garson 2001). The main points of disagreement\nconcerning the quantifier rules can be traced back to decisions about\nhow to handle the domain of quantification. The simplest alternative,\nthe fixed-domain (sometimes called the possibilist) approach, assumes\na single domain of quantification that contains all the possible\nobjects. On the other hand, the world-relative (or actualist)\ninterpretation, assumes that the domain of quantification changes from\nworld to world, and contains only the objects that actually exist in a\ngiven world.\n\nThe fixed-domain approach requires no major adjustments to the\nclassical machinery for the quantifiers. Modal logics that are\nadequate for fixed domain semantics can usually be axiomatized by\nadding principles of a propositional modal logic to classical\nquantifier rules together with the Barcan Formula \\((BF)\\) (Barcan\n1946). (For an account of some interesting exceptions see Cresswell\n(1995).) \n\\[\\tag{\\(BF\\)}\n \\forall x\\Box A\\rightarrow \\Box \\forall  xA.\n\\]\n\n\nThe fixed-domain interpretation has advantages of simplicity and\nfamiliarity, but it does not provide a direct account of the semantics\nof certain quantifier expressions of natural language. We do not think\nthat \u2018Some man exists who signed the Declaration of\nIndependence\u2019 is true, at least not if we read\n\u2018exists\u2019 in the present tense. Nevertheless, this sentence\nwas true in 1777, which shows that the domain for the natural language\nexpression \u2018some man exists who\u2019 changes to reflect which\nmen exist at different times. A related problem is that on the\nfixed-domain interpretation, the sentence \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists\nx(x=y)\\) is valid. Assuming that \\(\\exists x(x=y)\\) is read: \\(y\\)\nexists, \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists x(x=y)\\) says that everything exists\nnecessarily. However, it seems a fundamental feature of common ideas\nabout modality that the existence of many things is contingent and\nthat different objects exist in different possible worlds. \n\nThe defender of the fixed-domain interpretation may respond to these\nobjections by insisting that on his (her) reading of the quantifiers,\nthe domain of quantification contains all possible objects,\nnot just the objects that happen to exist at a given world. So the\ntheorem \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists x(x=y)\\) makes the innocuous claim\nthat every possible object is necessarily found in the domain\nof all possible objects. Furthermore, those quantifier expressions of\nnatural language whose domain is world (or time) dependent can be\nexpressed using the fixed-domain quantifier \\(\\exists x\\) and a\npredicate letter \\(E\\) with the reading \u2018actually exists\u2019.\nFor example, instead of translating \u2018Some \\(M\\)an exists who\n\\(S\\)igned the Declaration of Independence\u2019 by \n\\[\n \\exists x(Mx \\amp Sx),\n\\]\n\n\nthe defender of fixed domains may write:  \n\\[\n \\exists x(Ex \\amp Mx \\amp Sx),\n\\]\n\n\nthus ensuring the translation is counted false at the present time.\nCresswell (1991) makes the interesting observation that world-relative\nquantification has limited expressive power relative to fixed-domain\nquantification. World-relative quantification can be defined with\nfixed-domain quantifiers and \\(E\\), but there is no way to fully\nexpress fixed-domain quantifiers with world-relative ones. Although\nthis argues in favor of the classical approach to quantified modal\nlogic, the translation tactic also amounts to something of a\nconcession in favor of free logic, for the world-relative quantifiers\nso defined obey exactly the free logic rules. \n\nA problem with the translation strategy used by defenders of\nfixed-domain quantification is that rendering the English into logic\nis less direct, since \\(E\\) must be added to all translations of all\nsentences whose quantifier expressions have domains that are context\ndependent. A more serious objection to fixed-domain quantification is\nthat it strips the quantifier of a role which Quine recommended for\nit, namely to record robust ontological commitment. On this view, the\ndomain of \\(\\exists x\\) must contain only entities that are\nontologically respectable, and possible objects are too abstract to\nqualify. Actualists of this stripe will want to develop the logic of a\nquantifier \\(\\exists x\\) which reflects commitment to what is actual\nin a given world rather than to what is merely possible.\n\nHowever, some work on actualism tends to undermine this objection. For\nexample, Linsky and Zalta (1994) and Williamson (2013) argue that the\nfixed-domain quantifier can be given an interpretation that is\nperfectly acceptable to actualists. Pavone (2018) even contends that\non the haecceitist interpretation, which quantifies over individual\nessences, fixed domains are required. Actualists who employ possible\nworlds semantics routinely quantify over possible worlds in their\nsemantical theory of language. So it would seem that possible worlds\nare actual by these actualist\u2019s lights. By populating the domain\nwith abstract entities no more objectionable than possible worlds,\nactualists may vindicate the Barcan Formula and classical\nprinciples. \n\nHowever, recent work suggests that the fixed domain option may not be\nas actualist as originally thought; see Menzel 2020 and the entry on\nthe possibilism-actualism\ndebate. And some actualists might respond that they need not be\ncommitted to the actuality of possible worlds so long as it is\nunderstood that quantifiers used in their theory of language lack\nstrong ontological import. Furthermore, Hayaki (2006) argues that\nquantifying over abstract entities is actually incompatible with any\nserious form of actualism. In any case, it is open to actualists (and\nnon-actualists as well) to investigate the logic of quantifiers with\nmore robust domains, for example domains excluding possible worlds and\nother such abstract entities, and containing only the spatio-temporal\nparticulars found in a given world. For quantifiers of this kind,\nworld-relative domains are appropriate.\n\nSuch considerations motivate interest in systems that acknowledge the\ncontext dependence of quantification by introducing world-relative\ndomains. Here each possible world has its own domain of quantification\n(the set of objects that actually exist in that world), and the\ndomains vary from one world to the next. When this decision is made, a\ndifficulty arises for classical quantification theory. Notice that the\nsentence \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is a theorem of classical logic, and so\n\\(\\Box \\exists x(x=t)\\) is a theorem of \\(\\bK\\) by the Necessitation\nRule. Let the term \\(t\\) stand for Saul Kripke. Then this theorem says\nthat it is necessary that Saul Kripke exists, so that he is in the\ndomain of every possible world. The whole motivation for the\nworld-relative approach was to reflect the idea that objects in one\nworld may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rulers are\nused, however, every term \\(t\\) must refer to something that exists in\nall the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary\npractice of using terms to refer to things that only exist\ncontingently.\n\nOne response to this difficulty is simply to eliminate terms. Kripke\n(1963) gives an example of a system that uses the world-relative\ninterpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs\nare severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and\nsecond, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be\nweakened.\n\nPresuming that we would like a language that includes terms, and that\nclassical rules are to be added to standard systems of propositional\nmodal logic, a new problem arises. In such a system, it is possible to\nprove \\((CBF)\\), the converse of the Barcan Formula. \n\\[\\tag{\\(CBF\\)}\n \\Box \\forall xA\\rightarrow \\forall x\\Box A.\n\\]\n\n\nThis fact has serious consequences for the system\u2019s semantics.\nIt is not difficult to show that every world-relative model of\n\\((CBF)\\) must meet condition \\((ND)\\) (for \u2018nested\ndomains\u2019). \n\n\\((ND)\\)   If \\(wRv\\)\nthen the domain of \\(w\\) is a subset of the domain of \\(v\\).\n\n\n\nHowever \\((ND)\\) conflicts with the point of introducing\nworld-relative domains. The whole idea was that existence of objects\nis contingent so that there are accessible possible worlds where one\nof the things in our world fails to exist. \n\nA straightforward solution to these problems is to abandon classical\nrules for the quantifiers and to adopt rules for free logic\n\\((\\mathbf{FL})\\) instead. The rules of \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) are the same\nas the classical rules, except that inferences from \\(\\forall xRx\\)\n(everything is real) to \\(Rp\\) (Pegasus is real) are blocked. This is\ndone by introducing a predicate \u2018\\(E\\)\u2019 (for\n\u2018actually exists\u2019) and modifying the rule of universal\ninstantiation. From \\(\\forall xRx\\) one is allowed to obtain \\(Rp\\)\nonly if one also has obtained \\(Ep\\). Assuming that the universal\nquantifier \\(\\forall x\\) is primitive, and the existential quantifier\n\\(\\exists x\\) is defined by \\(\\exists xA =_{df} {\\sim}\\forall\nx{\\sim}A\\), then \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) may be constructed by adding the\nfollowing two principles to the rules of propositional logic.\n\nFree Universal Generalization.\n\nIf \\(B\\rightarrow(Ey\\rightarrow A(y))\\) is a theorem, so is\n\\(B\\rightarrow \\forall xA(x)\\).\n\nFree Universal Instantiation.\n\n\\(\\forall xA(x)\\rightarrow(Et\\rightarrow A(t))\\) \n\n(Here it is assumed that \\(A(x)\\) is any well-formed formula of\npredicate logic and that \\(A(y)\\) and \\(A(t)\\) result from replacing\n\\(y\\) and \\(t\\) properly for each occurrence of \\(x\\) in \\(A(x)\\).)\nNote that the instantiation axiom is restricted by mention of \\(Et\\)\nin the antecedent. The rule of Free Universial Generalization is\nmodified in the same way. In \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\), proofs of formulas like\n\\(\\exists x\\Box(x=t)\\), \\(\\forall y\\Box \\exists x(x=y)\\), \\((CBF)\\),\nand \\((BF)\\), which seem incompatible with the world-relative\ninterpretation, are blocked. \n\nOne philosophical objection to \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) is that \\(E\\) appears\nto be an existence predicate, and many would argue that existence is\nnot a legitimate property like being green or weighing more than four\npounds. So philosophers who reject the idea that existence is a\npredicate may object to \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\). However in most (but not all)\nquantified modal logics that include identity \\((=)\\) these worries\nmay be skirted by defining \\(E\\) as follows. \n\\[\n Et =_{df} \\exists x(x=t).\n\\]\n\n\nThe most general way to formulate quantified modal logic is to create\n\\(\\mathbf{FS}\\) by adding the rules of \\(\\mathbf{FL}\\) to a given\npropositional modal logic \\(\\mathbf{S}\\). In situations where\nclassical quantification is desired, one may simply add \\(Et\\) as an\naxiom to \\(\\mathbf{FS}\\), so that the classical principles become\nderivable rules. Adequacy results for such systems can be obtained for\nmost choices of the modal logic \\(\\mathbf{S}\\), but there are\nexceptions (Cresswell (1995). \n\nThere is another way to formulate quantified modal logics for\nworld-relative domains that avoids the non-standard quantifier rules\nof free logic and allows term constants in the language. Deutsch\n(1990) shows how to define such a semantics, where the classical\nprinciple \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) comes out valid. His strategy is inspired\nby Kaplan\u2019s (1989) idea that validity and necessity may part\ncompany. (See the discussion of two-dimensional semantics in\n Section 10\n above.) Kaplan showed that there are sentences such as \u2018I am\nhere now\u2019 that qualify as logically valid, because they are true\nin any context of their assertion, but which are not necessary. That\nsuggests a reply to anyone who objects to the classical theorem\n\\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) on the grounds that \u2018\\(t\\) exists\u2019 is\nnot necessary. One need only point out that the validity of \\(\\exists\nx(x=t)\\) is in fact compatible with its contingency.\n\nSpecial adjustments to the formal semantics are needed to flesh out\nthis idea. Deutsch introduces what he calls \u2018contexts of\norigin\u2019 as sequences of possible worlds. (These are not to be\nconfused with Kaplan\u2019s linguistic contexts.) However, Stephanou\n(2002) shows how to streamline the definition of a model so that this\nextra machinery is avoided. Deutsch\u2019s main idea is that a model\ndistinguishes one of the possible worlds \\(w^*\\) as actual, and the\nterm constants are directly assigned referents in the domain for\n\\(w^*\\). That ensures that \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is true in \\(w^*\\).\nAlthough \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is false in other worlds where the\nreferent of \\(t\\) does not exist, the definition of validity for this\nsemantics rates a sentence true provided it is true at the actual\nworld \\(w^*\\) for each model. The result is that \\(\\exists x(x=t)\\)\nand all classical quantifier principles are rated valid, even though\n\\(\\Box\\exists x(x=t)\\) is not.\n\nStephanou (2002) provides a set of axioms and rules that exactly\ncapture this notion of validity. Classical laws of quantification are\npreserved in the sense that the provable formulas lacking any modal\noperator are the classical ones. However, restrictions must be placed\non the rules of propositional modal logic. The Necessitation Rule (If\n\\(A\\) is a theorem, then so is \\(\\Box A\\)) cannot be accepted because\n\\(\\exists x(x=t)\\) is valid, while \\(\\Box\\exists x(x=t)\\) is not.\nFurthermore, the rules for quantification are more complex. Two axioms\nof Universal Instantiation are needed. One is restricted: \\(\\forall\nxA(x)\\rightarrow(Ft\\rightarrow A(t))\\), where \\(Ft\\) is any atomic\nsentence containing term \\(t\\). Since the semantics requires all\npredicate letters to have extensions for a world in the domain of that\nworld, \\(Ft\\) ensures that \\(t\\) refers to something that exists. So\nthis restricted axiom reminds one of Free Universal Instantiation. The\nsecond axiom is an unrestricted form of Instantiation: \\(\\forall\nxA(x)\\rightarrow A(t)\\). However, this principle comes with the\nproviso that once it is used in a proof, no axioms or rules may be\nused other than it and Modus Ponens. This has the effect of blocking\nthe use of Necessitation to obtain \\(\\Box\\exists x(x=t)\\) from\n\\(\\exists x(x=t)\\).\n\nNote that this strategy cannot treat all proper names in English as\nterms of the formal language, since those terms refer to what exists\nin the actual world. Therefore names for fictional entities\n(\u2018Pegasus\u2019) must be dealt with in another way, perhaps\nwith Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions. An alternative treatment\nwould also be need in a temporal logic for names of those who are\ndeceased (\u2018Benjamin Franklin\u2019).\n\nA final complication in the semantics for quantified modal logic is\nworth mentioning. It arises when non-rigid expressions such as\n\u2018the inventor of bifocals\u2019 are introduced to the language.\nA term is non-rigid when it picks out different objects in different\npossible worlds. The semantical value of such a term can be given by\nwhat Carnap (1947) called an individual concept, a function that picks\nout the denotation of the term for each possible world. One approach\nto dealing with non-rigid terms is to employ Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions. However, in a language that treats non rigid expressions\nas genuine terms, it turns out that neither the classical nor the free\nlogic rules for the quantifiers are acceptable. (The problem cannot be\nresolved by weakening the rule of substitution for identity.) A\nsolution to this problem is to employ a more general treatment of the\nquantifiers, where the domain of quantification contains individual\nconcepts rather than objects. This more general interpretation\nprovides a better match between the treatment of terms and the\ntreatment of quantifiers and results in systems that are adequate for\nclassical or free logic rules (depending on whether the fixed domains\nor world-relative domains are chosen). It also provides a language\nwith strong and much needed expressive powers (Bressan, 1973, Belnap\nand M\u00fcller, 2013a, 2013b). (See also Aloni (2005) who explores\nthe pros and cons of quantifying over individual concepts in\nepistemic logic.) ",
