    "main_text": "Life and Works || Works (extant and lost)\n1.2 Works (extant and lost)\n\n\nMarinus notes that Proclus was an extremely industrious writer,\nhaving an \u201cunbounded love of work\u201d (Life of\nProclus \u00a7 22). Apart from an impressive teaching-load and\nseveral other commitments, Proclus wrote every day about 700 lines\n(about 20\u201325 pages). It is unlikely that Proclus\npublished all of them. However that may be, from\nProclus\u2019 extant works and the information about his lost works it\nemerges that he was a productive writer indeed. Roughly two thirds of\nProclus\u2019 output is now lost and several works, especially his\ncommentaries on Plato, have been transmitted in a mutilated form.\n\n\nAmong Proclus\u2019 surviving works we have five commentaries on\nPlato (on Alcibiades, Cratylus, Republic,\nTimaeus, and Parmenides), one commentary on Euclid,\ntwo manuals on physics and metaphysics respectively (Elements of\nPhysics, Elements of Theology), an astronomical work\n(Hypotyp\u00f4sis), three monographs (Tria opuscula)\non providence, fate, and free will and the origin of evil, and the\nPlatonic Theology, which offers an impressive\nsumma of Plato\u2019s theology, as well as theological\nHymns.  See the supplement on\n\nProclus\u2019 Works\n (the main extant works).\n\n\nSome of his works have been completely lost, such as his commentaries\non Aristotle (the Organon), of others only a few fragments remain.\nSee the supplement on\n\nProclus\u2019 Complete Works (extant,\nlost, and spurious) [cf. Luna\u2013Segonds\u2013Endress (2012)].\n\n\nIt is difficult to establish a chronology of Proclus\u2019 works.\nThe Platonic Theology is generally considered to be\nhis last work. In writing the Theology Proclus heavily depends\non his interpretation of the Parmenides and often refers to\nhis commentary on this dialogue, which must have been finished some\ntime before. We know from Marinus (Life of Proclus \u00a713)\nthat Proclus finished his Commentary on the Timaeus by the age\nof 27. However, it cannot be excluded that Proclus rewrote or modified\nit later. As the Alcibiades came at the beginning of the\ncurriculum in the school, its commentary may also be an early work. The\nCommentary on the Republic is not a proper commentary, but a\ncollection of several essays on problems and sections in this dialogue.\nThese essays may have been written at different times in Proclus\u2019\nlife and only later put together (by Proclus himself or by someone\nelse). The Hypotyp\u00f4sis (Exposition of Astronomical Hypotheses)\nwas written in the year after Proclus\u2019 exile in Lydia, but we do\nnot know when exactly that took place. The Tria\nopuscula all deal with similar topics, but they need not have\nbeen composed at the same time. There are plausible arguments to put\nthe second treatise, On What Depends on Us, some years\nafter the events forcing Proclus to go into exile. The first treatise,\nwhich in some parts depends very much on Plutarch (of Chaironea,\n1st\u20132nd c. C.E.), could be set earlier in his\ncareer. It also contains a discussion on the nature of evil, which is\nmuch simpler than what we find in the treatise On the Existence of\nEvils, which is more sophisticated and probably was composed\nlater. Because of its introductory character, one may be inclined to\nconsider the Elements of Physics as an early\nwork. This has also been claimed for the Elements of\nTheology, which, however, shows all the sophistication of\nProclus\u2019s mature thought. It may be possible that Proclus revised\nthis text several times in his career.\n",
