    "main_text": "Feminist Re-reading of Classical Pragmatist Philosophers\n2. Feminist Re-reading of Classical Pragmatist Philosophers\n\nFeminist philosophers have taken on the project of re-examining\nphilosophic texts through the lens of gender, analyzing how particular\nthinkers\u2019 philosophies often depend on the subjugation of women;\nfor example, Rousseau\u2019s idealized \u201cEmile\u201d is only\npossible through the supporting role of the idea of\n\u201cSophie\u201d. Likewise, feminist pragmatists are examining the\nrole of women and gender in the canon of pragmatist philosophy,\nparticularly looking at the work of John Dewey, Charles Sanders\nPeirce, William James and George Herbert Mead. Pragmatism originated\nin a time when our culture was in the midst of enormous change in\nwomen\u2019s roles, yet early century male pragmatists were often\nunaware of how gender biases affected knowledge and culture as well as\ntheir own ideas. Like many figures in the philosophical canon, at\ntimes they universalize the male perspective.  Yet, as we will see,\npragmatism and feminism overlap in significant ways, and even in their\ncritiques, feminists find value in these thinkers\u2019 works.\n\nBooks such as Feminist Interpretations of John Dewey\n(Seigfried 2001) and Feminist Interpretations of William\nJames (Tarver and Sullivan 2015) have made these influences\nclear. In this latter volume Erin McKenna\u2019s essay, \u201cWomen\nand William James\u201d, points out James\u2019 expectation that the\nwomen in his life (particularly his wife, mother and sister) play\ntraditional roles of self-sacrifice.  The concept of \u201cfree\nwill\u201d is central to James\u2019 work, yet, as McKenna reveals,\nhe didn\u2019t grasp how his gender, class, and race provided him\nthis freedom. \n\n\nThe opportunity to exercise \u201cfree will\u201d was not shared\nequally, and he did not see now his freedom intersected with the\noppression of others. (McKenna 2015: 83)\n\n\nOther pragmatist feminists have also examined the gendered reception\nof philosophers\u2019 writings, for example, Marilyn Fischer reread\nJames\u2019s acclaimed \u201cThe Moral Equivalent of War\u201d in\nthe context of its time, demonstrating that James drew on\n\u201ccommon conceptions shared by militarists, misogynists, and\nimperialists of the day\u201d (2018).\n\nDewey\u2019s thinking was also shaped by the gendered expectations of\nhis time and place, even though women played more equal roles in his\nlife. As Seigfried noted (1998), Dewey was a supporter of many\nfeminist causes. Yet, as she also pointed out later, \u201cthe\npitfalls of a view of women seen solely from a male perspective, even\nthat of a sympathetic male\u201d still affect Dewey\u2019s writing\n(2001: 10). Why does this\nmatter? As Nancy Tuana has said, \n\n\nPaying attention to the workings of gender within the texts of\nphilosophy will make visible the complexities of the inscription of\ngender ideologies. (Tarver and Sullivan 2015: ix) \n\n\nThese feminist re-readings and analyses have provided a view of the\ncultural context of pragmatist writings; it helps us understand how\nand why women were marginalized in the intellectual history of\npragmatism. As we will see, these important critiques have not\ndeterred feminist pragmatists from seeing the value in and building\nupon the work of these classical pragmatist thinkers.\n",
