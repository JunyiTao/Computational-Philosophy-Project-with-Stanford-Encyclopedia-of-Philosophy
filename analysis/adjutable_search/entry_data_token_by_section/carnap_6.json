    "main_text": "General Characterization of Carnap\u2019s Philosophy || Structuralism\n1.7 Structuralism\n\nAnother strand of Carnap\u2019s indifference to ontology was his\nlifelong focus on structures as the main objects of\nknowledge. Even as early as 1922, Carnap had thought that mathematics,\ncorrectly understood, is not so much the study of quantity and number\nas the study of structures; Kant\u2019s dictum that something is\nscientific just insofar as it is mathematical was now superseded, he\nthought, by his new dictum that something is scientific just insofar\nas it is structural (Carnap 1922b: p. cl[r], translated and\nquoted in Carus 2007a: 163). And if the object of our knowledge is not\nthe particular or the qualitative but the structural, then, as Hermann\nWeyl had said, \u201cA science can determine its subject matter only\nup to an isomorphic representation\u201d.\n\n\nIn particular, it is altogether indifferent toward the\n\u201cessence\u201d of its objects of study\u2026It is mysticism\nto expect of scientific knowledge that it reveal\u2014to\nacquaintance\u2014a deeper essence than that openly available to\nacquaintance. The conception of isomorphism pinpoints the\nunquestionable and ineluctable limit to knowledge. (Weyl 1926: 22\n[1947: 25\u201326])\n\n\nWeyl speaks here in the language of axiomatic systems and their\nstructurally identical\u2014isomorphic\u2014models, a language\nlargely articulated at the beginning of the twentieth century by David\nHilbert. But Hilbert had only made more precise the notions of\nstructuralism that went further back and had animated a great deal of\nnineteenth-century mathematics (see Schiemer 2013), culminating in the\ngroup-theoretic (algebraic) understanding of the new non-Euclidean\ngeometries and Felix Klein\u2019s celebrated \u201cErlanger\nProgramm\u201d for the unification of geometry by this means, which\nalso inspired the early Bertrand Russell. Russell himself, and before\nhim Gottlob Frege and Richard Dedekind, had given\n\u201ctop-down\u201d definitions of structural concepts by means of\nhigher-order logical quantifiers (as in Frege\u2019s 1879 famous\ndefinition of the ancestral of a relation in his\nBegriffsschrift, or in Dedekind\u2019s 1888 definition of\nsimply infinite system in his Was sind und was sollen die\nZahlen?, or in Whitehead and Russell\u2019s 1910\u20131913\nPrincipia Mathematica), all of which influenced Carnap\nsignificantly. An equally important influence, at about the same time\nas Klein, was the epistemological structuralism of Hermann von\nHelmholtz. Carnap was clearly inspired by these ideas, not only in his\nearliest work, but all through his career, even into his work on\nprobability and induction, as we will see below\n (section 8).\n\nCarnap is best known, though, for his application of structuralism\nfirst to epistemology, in the Aufbau, and then to mathematics\nitself, in the Syntax and later work, as well as to\nmathematically formulated scientific theories. The frameworks\ndiscussed in section 1.2 above were always structural ones, in which\nCarnap invariably abstracted from the actual instantiation of the\nstructures in question in actual languages or conceptual systems, with\nthe result that even some of his closest allies and associates\nmisunderstood him, including (among others) Russell, Neurath, Popper,\nand Quine (see\n sections 3\n through 8 below for details). The articulation of these structural\nframeworks is discussed in the supplements\n Aufbau,\n Logical Syntax of Language,\n Semantics,\n and\n Reconstruction of Scientific Theories.\n\nCarnap\u2019s structuralism about mathematics also points forward, in\nits anticipation, for instance, of Tarski\u2019s structural\ndelimitation of logic modeled on the Erlanger Programm (Tarski 1986,\nSher 1991), and has recently been seen as a precursor of a new form of\nmathematical structuralism based on homotopy type theory in its\nemphasis on invariance (Awodey 2017).\n\nFrom the Aufbau (see the supplement\n Aufbau (Section 2)\n on Carnap\u2019s early structuralism) to his mature reconstruction\nof scientific theories (see the supplement\n The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 6)\n on Carnap\u2019s later structuralism), Carnap sought to articulate\nan innovative type of conceptual or linguistic\nstructuralism about science that is metaphysically neutral and which\nresembles modern versions of structuralism about mathematics: the\ncognitive content of what can be asserted precisely and meaningfully\nin science can be reconstructed as a structural constraint on\nempirical content, and one should aim at such structural\nreconstructions as they enhance the objectivity of science. While\nstructural properties are expressed using logical concepts usually\ndiscussed in the context of deductive logic, Carnap\u2019s\nlater work on inductive logic considers probability measures\nthat are logical or structural in the analogous sense, i.e., where\nprobabilities remain invariant under isomorphisms. This\n\u201cinductive structuralism\u201d is discussed in supplement\n Inductive Logic.\n",
