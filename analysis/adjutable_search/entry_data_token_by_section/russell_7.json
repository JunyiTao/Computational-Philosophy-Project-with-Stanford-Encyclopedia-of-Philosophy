    "main_text": "Russell\u2019s Social and Political Philosophy\n8. Contemporary Russell Scholarship\n\nSince his death in 1970, Russell\u2019s reputation as a philosopher\nhas continued to grow. This increase in reputation has been\naccompanied by a corresponding increase in scholarship. Older\nfirst-hand accounts of Russell\u2019s life, such as Dora\nRussell\u2019s The Tamarisk Tree (1975, 1981, 1985),\nKatharine Tait\u2019s My Father Bertrand Russell (1975) and\nRonald Clark\u2019s The Life of Bertrand Russell (1975),\nhave been supplemented by more recent accounts, including Caroline\nMoorehead\u2019s Bertrand Russell (1992), John\nSlater\u2019s Bertrand Russell (1994), and Ray Monk\u2019s\nBertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude (1996) and\nBertrand Russell: The Ghost of Madness (2000). \n\nThis increase in scholarship has benefited greatly from the existence\nof the\n Bertrand Russell Archives\n at McMaster University, where the bulk of Russell\u2019s library and\nliterary estate are housed, and from the\n Bertrand Russell Research Centre,\n also housed at McMaster. Books such as Nicholas Griffin\u2019s\nSelected Letters of Bertrand Russell (1992, 2001), Gregory\nLandini\u2019s Russell\u2019s Hidden Substitutional Theory\n(1998) and Bernard Linsky\u2019s The Evolution of Principia\nMathematica (2011) have helped make public archival material\nthat, in the past, has been available only to specialists. Since 1983\nthe\n Bertrand Russell Editorial Project,\n initiated by John Slater and Kenneth Blackwell, has also begun to\nrelease authoritative, annotated editions of Russell\u2019s\n Collected Papers.\n When complete, this collection will run to over 35 volumes and will\nbring together all of Russell\u2019s writings, other than his\ncorrespondence and previously published monographs. \n\nRecent scholarship has also helped remind readers of the influence\nRussell\u2019s students had on Russell\u2019s philosophy.\n Ludwig Wittgenstein\n and Frank Ramsey especially presented Russell with helpful criticisms\nof his work and new problems to solve. Both men pushed Russell to\ndevelop new theories in logic and epistemology. Despite the fact that\nWittgenstein was less than satisfied with Russell\u2019s Introduction\nto his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), Michael\nPotter\u2019s Wittgenstein\u2019s Notes on Logic (2009) and\nthe introductory materials published in Russell\u2019s Theory of\nKnowledge: The 1913 Manuscript (CP, Vol. 7) show the extent and\nfruitfulness of the interaction between teacher and student. \n\nSince Russell\u2019s death, debate has also taken place over the\nultimate importance of Russell\u2019s contributions, not just to\nphilosophy, but to other disciplines as well. Advocates of\nRussell\u2019s inclusion in the canon remind readers that few have\ndone more to advance both formal logic and analytic philosophy. As P.F. Strawson concludes, Russell\u2019s influence \u201con the philosophy of his and our time has perhaps been greater than that of any other single individual\u201d (Strawson 1984, 104). \n Critics of Russell\u2019s inclusion in the canon, or at least of his canonization, remind\nreaders of Russell\u2019s early enthusiasm for British imperialism\n(1967, 134) and of his controversial comments about eugenics and race\n(1929, 259, 266). Others have noted his apparent early antisemitism\nand his advocacy of a preemptive nuclear war against the Soviet Union\nfollowing World War II (Hook 1976, Stone 1981, Perkins 1994, Blitz\n2002). On the issue of a preemptive war, Russell himself later denied\nhe had ever advocated such a course of action. However, after carefully \nreviewing the historical record, biographer Ronald Clark\ncomes to a different conclusion. Clark is also unequivocal about\nRussell\u2019s lack of sincerity on the issue: \u201cIf the\nsuggestion that he deliberately tried to conceal his earlier views is\nrepugnant, the record does not really allow any other conclusion to be\ndrawn\u201d (Clark 1975, 530). Perhaps as a result of such\nobservations, many readers remain undecided when attempting to\nevaluate Russell\u2019s overall contribution to the intellectual life\nof the twentieth century. \n\nMonk\u2019s two volumes are a significant case in point. In addition\nto his ground-breaking biographical work, Monk relates\nWittgenstein\u2019s humorous suggestion that all of Russell\u2019s\nbooks should be bound in two colours, \u201cthose dealing with\nmathematical logic in red \u2013 and all students of philosophy\nshould read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue\n\u2013 and no one should be allowed to read them\u201d (Monk 2000,\n278). Others, such as Peter Stone, have argued that such caricatures\nare based on \u201ca misunderstanding of the nature of Russell as a\npolitical figure\u201d (2003, 89) and that \u201cWhatever one thinks\nof Russell\u2019s politics, he was one of the few public figures in\nthe west to stand against capitalism without succumbing to illusions\nabout Stalinist Russia. If for no other reason than this, Russell\ndeserves some credit for his political instincts\u201d (2003, 85).\n(See, for example, Russell 1920 and 1922c, and Russell et al. 1951.)\n\nHow is the ordinary reader to decide between such conflicting\nevaluations? Unlike the many logical advances Russell introduced, in\npolitics he is still usually understood to be more of an advocate than\na theoretician. As a result, his reputation as a political thinker has\nnot been as high as his reputation in logic, metaphysics and\nepistemology. \n\nEven so, regardless of his many particular contributions,\nRussell\u2019s lasting reputation has also benefited significantly\nfrom his constant willingness to abandon unsupported theories and\noutdated beliefs. To his great credit, when new evidence presented\nitself, Russell was always among the first to take it into account:\n\u201cAgainst my will, in the course of my travels, the belief that\neverything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off. In\nthis respect,\u201d says Russell, \u201cmy travels were very useful\nto me\u201d (1967, 133). \n\nA short anecdote recounted in Russell\u2019s Autobiography\nis also typical. As a young man, he says, he spent part of each day\nfor many weeks \n\nreading Georg Cantor, and copying out the gist of him into a notebook.\nAt that time I falsely supposed all his arguments to be fallacious,\nbut I nevertheless went through them all in the minutest detail. This\nstood me in good stead when later on I discovered that all the\nfallacies were mine. (1967, 127)\n\n",
