    "main_text": "The Value of Personal Relationship Goods\n3. The Value of Personal Relationship Goods\n\nPersonal relationship goods have been argued to have constitutive\nvalue, as explained in 3.1. Maybe even more obviously, they are\nvaluable as instrumental to various important ends, explored by\nsubsections 3.2 to 3.7. Philosophers advance arguments proceeding from\nthe particular kinds of value of personal relationship goods to the\nconclusion that there are duties to provide them. In some cases, they\nmay generate duties of justice and individual entitlements.\n",
