These include acknowledgment of the\nwomen\u2019s actual, unwarranted, institutionalization, as well as\nemphasis on harms of disempowerment and silencing (Kristeva 1987\n[1989]), and of epistemic injustices (Dotson 2011; Kidd, Spencer &\nCarel 2022; and see entry on Feminist Social Epistemology). In a\nlegacy affecting mental disorder even today, binary conceptualizations\nhave assigned women and the feminine to illogicality, emotionality,\nsubjectivity, the bodily, and madness, in contrast to men\u2019s more\nvalued traits (G. Lloyd 1984; Potter 2009). Feminist thinkers have\nfocused on the medicalization of women\u2019s normal traits, as well\nas research neglect and distortion of gender-linked disorders;\nseparate and unequal treatments; the mental health vulnerabilities\nassociated with traditional women\u2019s roles and identities; and\ndiagnosis and treatment understood as tools of patriarchal social\ncontrol (Russell 1995; Ussher 2011; Gagn\u00e9-Julien 2021).\n\nFeminism has consistently rejected traditional causal explanations of\nwomen\u2019s disorder derived from allegedly natural biological\npredispositions, pointing instead to the effects of women\u2019s\noppressive socialization and to the consequences of devaluing\nwomen\u2019s characteristics and abilities (Bluhm 2011). Similarly,\nit has emphasized the embodiment, and relationality, of the self and\navoided the methodological individualism associated with psychiatric\nmedicine (Bluhm, Jacobson, & Maibom 2012). Influenced by social\ntheory and phenomenological approaches, more recent work focuses on\nthe intersection of gender with marginality, invisibility,\nnon-normativity and oppression in lived experience (Nissim-Sabat 2013;\nZeiler & Folkmarson K\u00e4ll 2014).\n",
