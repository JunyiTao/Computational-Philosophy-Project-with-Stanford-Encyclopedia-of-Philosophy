    "main_text": "Conceivability, Imagination, Intuition, and Understanding || Intuition and Understanding\n4.3 Intuition and Understanding\n\nThe epistemology of modality is importantly connected to the\nepistemology of the\n a priori,\n as many believe that at least some modal knowledge is purely a\npriori (modal rationalism). Some philosophers have\nproposed that either\n intuition\n or understanding, or both of them combined, can provide an account of\na priori knowledge and justification, which may be fruitfully\napplied to the epistemology of modality. Others have explicitly\noffered an intuition-based or understanding-based account of modal\nknowledge. (For an empirically informed discussion of intuition see\nentry on\n experimental philosophy.)\n\nPhilosophers such as Bealer (1998, 1999a,b ), BonJour (1997), Pust\n(2000), Huemer (2001, 2005), Koksvik (2011), and Chudnoff (2013), have\ndeveloped accounts of the a priori that appeal to intuition\nas the source of a priori knowledge and justification. Most\nof them take intuition to form a natural kind of seeming\nstate that is non-reducible to either belief or inclinations to\nbelieve; rather it is sui generis. On the other hand,\nphilosophers like Boghossian (1996, 2000), Jackson (2000); Hale and\nWright (2000); and Peacocke (1999, 2000) have highlighted various ways\nin which appealing to understanding of meaning may contribute to\nexplaining a priori knowledge and justification. Here we\ndiscuss a few accounts that directly connect the epistemology of the\na priori with the epistemology of modality.\n\nAccording to BonJour, intuition is a direct grasp or \u201crational\ninsight\u201d into \u201cthe necessary character of reality\u201d\n(1997: 107). This occurs when we \u201csee or grasp or apprehend in a\nseemingly direct and unmediated way\u201d (1997: 101) the necessity\nof a proposition. This grasping \u201cdepends upon nothing beyond an\nunderstanding of the propositional content itself\u201d (1997: 102).\nBy explicitly providing knowledge of necessity, intuition, as cashed\nout by BonJour, is thus a main source of modal knowledge.\n\nImportantly, many that defend intuition hold that they are fallible\nand revisable, and arguably only reliable in certain domains. Still,\nintuitions minimally provide prima facie justification, which\nmight be defeated by further reasoning or empirical evidence. As\napplied to modal knowledge, intuitions provide at least prima\nfacie a priori justification for our modal beliefs and/or for\nsome basic essentialist principles. For example, consider (RG):\n\n(RG)\nNothing can be red all over and green all over at the same\ntime.\n\n\nBonJour maintains that we directly grasp the necessity of\n (RG).\n For him, (RG) is self-evident or just seems necessarily\ntrue. So, on the view that intuitions justify, our intuitions provide\nat least prima facie justification for (RG). (See Levin 2007\nfor skepticism about the justificatory status of intuitions in\nrelation to essentialism, such as the essentiality of origins or\nfundamental kind; for further discussion see\n arguments for origin essentialism\n in the entry on\n essential vs. accidental properties.)\n\nGeorge Bealer (1996, 1998, 1999a,b, 2002; Bealer in Bealer &\nStrawson 1992) integrates understanding and intuition in order to\nexplain knowledge of modality. As an intuitionist, Bealer takes\nintuitions to count as (prima facie) evidence. According to\nBealer\u2019s Modal Reliabilism \u201csomething is a basic\nsource of evidence iff it has an appropriate kind of reliable tie to\nthe truth\u201d (Bealer 1999a: 34). He articulates a notion of\ndeterminate understanding (or determinate concept possession)\nthat casts light on how our modal intuitions can be appropriately\ntruth-tracking and, thus reliable. Roughly, determinate\nunderstanding (or concept possession) excludes any partial\nmisunderstanding or incomplete understanding of the concept(s) in\nquestion. It ultimately amounts to a form of understanding that is\nincorrigible by improvement of the subject\u2019s cognitive\ncondition or conceptual repertoire (see Bealer 2002: 104). So, if we\ndeterminately understand a specific concept, we will have\ntruth-tracking intuitions (and therefore also truth-tracking modal\nintuitions) about propositions in which this concept is involved.\nFor example, it is because one determinately understands the concepts\nof a square and a triangle, that their intuition\nthat nothing can be both a square and a triangle is truth-tracking\nand, thus, provides them with evidence that it is impossible\nfor something to be both a square and a triangle.\n\nChristopher Peacocke (1999, 2002) explicitly puts forward an account\nof modal knowledge that appeals to understanding and tacit knowledge\nof certain modal principles, while it eschews the role of intuition.\nPeacocke tackles the Integration Challenge and, in particular, the\nfact that we lack a causal connection to modal facts and properties as\ncommonly understood in the metaphysical framework of possible worlds.\nHe believes that the best way to solve the problem is to adopt\nModerate Rationalism, which\n\n\nseeks to explain cases of a priori knowledge by appeal to the\nnature of the concepts that feature in contents that are known a\npriori (2004: 199).\n\n\nMore precisely, Peacocke holds that understanding of metaphysical\nmodality, namely the concepts of possibility and necessity, consists\nin having implicit knowledge of what he calls Principles\nof Possibility, which include principles concerning the rules of\nconcept use, as well as constitutive (or essentialist) principles.\nThese principles govern understanding and evaluation of modal\ndiscourse and accordingly are implicitly known and deployed by\nsubjects that correctly understand the modal concepts. Crucially, for\nPeacocke, these principles are necessary truths, and\nunderstanding and being able to deploy them is essential to modal\nthinking and evaluation. As he puts it,\n\n\nwe must be able to identify some of [these principles] if reasoning\nwithin the scope of counterfactual suppositions is to proceed. (1999:\n173)\n\n\nTalk of a subject\u2019s tacit knowledge of the\nPrinciples of Possibility might suggest that Peacocke\u2019s theory is\nmodelled on the way in which principles of grammaticality govern how\nnormal adult speakers understand and evaluate grammaticality in their\nnative language. Classic Chomskian theory holds that adult speakers\nhave some grasp or tacit knowledge of certain principles of grammar\ngoverning correct expression and communication in our natural\nlanguage. However, Peacocke makes an important qualification to\nthe analogy with the Chomskian view. Although an ordinary thinker\nmight not be able to state the Principles of Possibility explicitly,\nshe will have reasons supporting her modal\njudgements, i.e., some way of articulating the beliefs or conceptions\nsupporting her judgments of possibility and necessity. In this sense,\nPrinciples of Possibility \u201cbear a much closer relation to [one\u2019s]\npersonal-level modal thought than do the principles of grammar to his\nthought about his own language\u201d (1999: 164).\n\nFor a recent view that combines understanding of meaning and intuition\nfor knowledge of modality, see Boghossian Ch. 13 in Boghossian and\nWilliamson 2020.\nCritical Questions for Intuition- and Understanding-Based Accounts\n\nThe Causal Connection Question: One might wonder\nhow intuition might justify beliefs about modal facts and\nproperties that we are not causally or spatio-temporally connected to.\nHow can intuition yield knowledge of modality if there is no causal\nconnection between possible worlds and minds? If there is no causal\nconnection between the mind and the modal fact, what kind of epistemic\nconnection could an intuition provide us with? (For discussion see\nBealer 2002).\n\nThe Justification for Implicit Knowledge Question:\nSonia Roca-Royes (2010) draws attention to the following problem in\nPeacocke\u2019s epistemology of modality. On Peacocke\u2019s\naccount, it appears that our knowledge or understanding of modality is\nparasitic on our knowledge of the Principles of Possibility, which are\nthe principles anyone who possesses the concept of possibility tacitly\nknows. But how do we know such principles in the first place, or,\nequivalently, how does one manage to possess the right\npossibility-concept? We determine that something is possible or\nnecessary for an entity in part through our tacit knowledge of them,\nwhich includes knowledge of what is constitutive of the entity, namely\nwhat it is to be the kind of thing in question. As a consequence of\nthe relation between the role of constitutive principles and our\nevaluation of specific modal claims for the purposes of generating\nmodal knowledge, a comprehensive account of modal knowledge is\nincomplete without a picture of how we come to know the relevant\nconstitutive principles involved in our evaluations of modal\nknowledge. Peacocke has taken up this challenge in recent work (2020).\nMore recently, Roca-Royes (2019) has generalized similar concerns to\nany account of modal knowledge that rests on concept possession and\nunderstanding.\n\nThe Implicit to Explicit Knowledge Question: We said\nthat for Peacocke our knowledge or understanding of modality is\nparasitic on our knowledge of the Principles of Possibility. However,\nit seems somewhat unclear how our tacit knowledge of\nPrinciples of Possibility exactly gives us explicit knowledge of modal\nfacts. In other words, it seems that Peacocke owes us an answer to the\nfollowing question: How exactly are we to epistemically move from\n(implicit) knowledge of Principles of Possibility to (explicit)\nknowledge of modal facts or propositions so that knowledge is\ntransmitted? In answer to this question Peacocke offers the\nfollowing:\n\n\nIf it is granted that implicit knowledge of the Principles of\nPossibility is appropriately employed in reaching modal judgement, we\ncan see how the judgement so reached is knowledge. Provided that any\nnon-modal principles upon which she relies are known, a\nthinker\u2019s modal judgements reached by the proper use of the\nimplicit knowledge of the Principles of Possibility will, in the\nnature of the case, be knowledge. This is not only a matter of\nreliability. The judgement of the modal truth is explained by the\nthinker\u2019s implicit grasp of principles which make the modal\ntruth hold. (1999: 162)\n\n\nHowever, this leaves open what it means exactly to appropriately\nemploy the Principles of Possibility. Finally, thinking of the debate\nbetween internalism and externalism in epistemology, it is relevant to\nask whether our implicit knowledge of the Principles of Possibility\nguides our judgment in a way such that this is accessible to\nthe subject.\n",
