    "main_text": "Objections to the MWI || Derivation of the Probability Postulate\n6.4 Derivation of the Probability Postulate\n\nA popular criticism of the MWI in the past, see Belinfante 1975, which\nwas repeated by Putnam 2005, is based on the naive derivation of the\nprobability of an outcome of a quantum experiment as being\nproportional to the number of worlds with this outcome. Such a\nderivation leads to the wrong predictions, but accepting the idea of\nprobability being proportional to the measure of existence of a world\nresolves this problem. Although this involves adding a postulate, we\ndo not complicate the mathematical part (i) of the theory since we do\nnot change the ontology, namely, the wave function. It is a postulate\nbelonging to part (ii), the connection to our experience, and it is a\nvery natural postulate: differences in the mathematical descriptions\nof worlds are manifest in our experience, see Saunders 1998.\n\nAnother criticism related to probability follows from the claim,\napparently made by Everett himself and later by many other proponents\nof the MWI, see De Witt 1970, that the Probability Postulate can be\n derived  just from the formalism of the MWI. Unfortunately,\nthe criticism of this derivation (which might well be correct) is\nconsidered to be a criticism of the MWI, see Kent 1990. The recent\nrevival of this claim involving decision theory, Deutsch 1999, 2012,\nand some other symmetry arguments Zurek 2005, Sebens and Carroll 2018\nalso encountered strong criticisms (see Section 4.3) which might be\nperceived as criticisms of the MWI itself. Whereas the MWI may have no\nadvantage over other interpretations insofar as the derivation of the\nBorn rule is concerned, Papineau 2010 argues that it also has no\ndisadvantages.\n\nThe issue, named by Wallace 2003 as the \u201cincoherence\u201d\nprobability problem, is arguably the most serious difficulty. How can\none talk about probability when all possible outcomes happen? This led\nSaunders and Wallace 2008a to introduce uncertainty to the MWI, see\nrecent analysis in Saunders forthcoming-b. However, Section 4.2 shows how one\ncan explain the illusion of probability of an observer in a world,\nwhile the Universe incorporating all the worlds remains deterministic,\nsee also Vaidman 2014. Albert 2010, 2015 argue that Vaidman\u2019s\nprobability appears too late. Vaidman 2012 and McQueen and Vaidman\n2019 answer Albert by viewing the probability as the value of a\nrational bet on a particular result. The results of the betting of the\nexperimenter are relevant for his successors emerging in different\nworlds after performing the experiment. Since the experimenter is\nrelated to all of his successors and they all have identical rational\nstrategies for betting, then this should also be the strategy of the\nexperimenter before the experiment.\n",
