    "main_text": "The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n6. The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy\n\nCicero\u2019s second, and most intense, period of philosophical\nproduction occurs during the last few years of his life, a period that\nsaw the dictatorship and then assassination of Julius Caesar. The\nlatter event caused Cicero\u2019s political stock to rise briefly\nbut, in the end, brought only futile hope of the restoration of\nrepublican government. The political situation, combined with personal\ntragedy \u2013 the death of his daughter Tullia in childbirth \u2013\nresulted in a remarkable bout of creativity during which Cicero\nproduced substantial works on a wide range of philosophical themes.\nHis ambition, as he puts it in his preface to On the Nature of the\nGods (1.7), was to compose nothing less than a comprehensive\ntreatment covering \u2018the whole of philosophy\u2019 \u2013 a\nveritable encyclopedia of the subject.\n\nFor the purposes of this entry, a more selective approach is adopted.\nThree late dialogues will be highlighted below, but the late period\nalso saw the composition of two works likely to be relatively familiar\nto non-specialists: On Duties (De Officiis),\nconcerning practical conduct, and Tusculan Disputations, on\nthe theory of the emotions, together with a trio of works on mainly\nStoic themes: On Fate (De Fato), On\nDivination (De Divinatione) and Stoic Paradoxes\n(Paradoxa Stoicorum), as well as a pair on specific issues in\nethics: On Old Age (De Senectute) and On\nFriendship (De Amicitia). In what follows, further works\nfrom the period on each of three central topics \u2013 epistemology,\nethical theory and theology \u2013 are discussed, in order to offer a\nrepresentative illustration of the distinctiveness of Cicero\u2019s\napproach as an Academic sceptic and writer of philosophical\ndialogues.\n",
