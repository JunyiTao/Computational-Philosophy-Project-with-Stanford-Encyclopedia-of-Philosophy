    "main_text": "The Aufbau || Main Point and Motivation of the Aufbau\n3.1 Main Point and Motivation of the Aufbau\n\nAs we saw in\n section 2\n above, the Aufbau project began as a continuation of the\nencyclopedic ambitions of the Enlightenment, in response to the\ncatastrophe of the war and the hopes inspired by the German\nrevolution\u2014only that in contrast to the eighteenth-century\nEncyclop\u00e9distes, and to similar projects since then,\nCarnap conceived the idea of a system of knowledge as a\ndeductive system, under the influence of his teacher\nFrege.\n\nBy the time of the book\u2019s publication the emphasis had shifted,\nbut the idea of bringing all concepts into a single deductive system\nsurvives. In a lecture given to a general audience in Vienna in 1929,\nCarnap explains the point of his book by telling a dialectical story\nof human history as a struggle between \u201ccritical\nintellect\u201d and \u201cimagination\u201d. At first imagination\nruled the day, but then in antiquity, critical intellect made a\ndiscovery that enabled it to put strict limits on imagination\u2019s\nclaims:\n\n\nThat is the discovery of one [single] comprehensive\nspace. All things are in space; any two things are always\nspatially related to each other. So there is also a path from me to\nany [given] thing.\n\n\nSo existence claims could now be subjected to a simple test:\n\n\nEvery thing is accessible. If someone now claims that a thing\nof a particular kind exists, I can demand of him that he show me the\npath from me to the claimed thing.\n\n\nImagination responds by relocating its gods and gremlins to remote or\ninaccessible locations, but as humankind explores more of the earth,\nthis stops working. So imagination \u201cgoes for a really radical\noption; it evacuates its creations to the non-spatial, the\n\u2018trans-spatial\u2019\u201d, which is plausible since we quite\nlegitimately refer to things that are not physical objects, so not\nlocatable in space. Feelings, mental images, and thoughts, for\ninstance, are non-spatial. So instead of situating its gods in a\nphysical location such as Mount Olympus, Carnap explained,\n\n\nthe putative God was removed from space into the realm of the spirits.\nGod was regarded now as a spiritual being without a body.\n\n\nBut people starting noticing \u201cthat something isn\u2019t quite\nright with that sort of claim, that there is something rather odd,\nsomething problematic about it\u201d. So imagination went further and\nreplaced theology with metaphysics.\n\n\nHere the concept of God no longer has anything physical or anything\nphysically rooted about it\u2026 The flight from the grasp of\ncritical reason with its spatial system appears to have been\ncompletely successful.\n\n\nBut critical intellect now has an answer: the Aufbau\nsystem\u2014\u201cnow a system is discovered that comprehends not\njust [corporeal] things, but everything thinkable, all concepts,\nwhether thing-like or not\u201d. This system is the natural successor\nand generalization, in Carnap\u2019s dialectical drama, of physically\nall-encompassing space:\n\n\nIn space all things have spatial relations to each other, and there\nhas to be a path of access from me to each thing. In the same way, on\nthe basis of the concept-system, an all-comprehending conceptual\nspace, so to speak, all concepts have relations to each other (in this\ncase logical, conceptual relations). And here there has to be a\nconnecting path to each concept from the contents of my experience,\ne.g., from my perceptions. Everything of which I can speak has to be\ntraceable back to things experienced by me. All knowledge I can have\nrelates either to my own feelings, mental images, thoughts, etc. or\ncan be derived from my perceptions\u2026\n\n\nThough Carnap had redesigned the system in 1924 to dispense with the\nphenomenological development of the \u201cprimary world\u201d from\nwhich the \u201crealities\u201d or \u201csecondary worlds\u201d of\nscience and everyday reality were constructed, it could be said that\nhe adopted Husserl\u2019s method of \u201cbracketing\u201d the\nsupposed external reality to which our subjective world appears to\nrefer\u2014and that he adopted it more radically and strictly than\nHusserl himself. For Carnap bracketed not just the external reality\nbut also the internal subjectivity, leaving only the bare logical\nstructure of the constitution system unbracketed (Carus 2016).\n",
