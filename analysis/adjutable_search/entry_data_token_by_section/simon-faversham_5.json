    "main_text": "Psychology || Definition of the Soul and Body/Soul Relation\n4.1 Definition of the Soul and Body/Soul Relation\n\nSimon\u2019s general psychology is standard Aristotelian doctrine, in\nmany aspects derived from Albert the Great\u2019s and Aquinas\u2019s\npsychological teachings. However, as we shall see, Simon sometimes\nconflates their views, suggesting he was not entirely aware of their\nopposition. Thus, Simon holds that the rational soul is the\nsubstantial form of the human body because it is that on account of\nwhich humans can perform their proper operation, i.e., intellection.\nHowever, unlike the substantial form of purely material things, the\nsubstantial form of a human being does not emerge from a natural\narrangement of matter, but is given to the human body as its\nperfection by an external source, i.e., by the first cause. Simon then\ndescribes the soul both as the perfection (like Albert) and as the\nsubstantial form (like Aquinas) of the human body, but seems unaware\nof the conflict between Albert\u2019s and Aquinas\u2019s positions.\nFor Albert, who wants to avoid psychological materialism, the soul is\nthe perfection, and not the form, of the human body; a soul that is\ngiven to it by God. For Aquinas, however, who wants to make the\nrational soul the defining element in a human being, the soul must be\nthe intrinsic substantial form of the human body, which is\nnonetheless separable after the body\u2019s death. It remains unclear\nwhether Simon intentionally conflated the two views, and if so,\nwhether he thought the two views could be somehow reconciled.\n\nThe rational soul has three faculties\u2014vegetative, sensitive and\nintellectual\u2014of which the sensitive and the intellectual are\ncognitive. The sensitive faculty is bodily because its operations\nfully depend on bodily organs. It includes the external\nsenses\u2014touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight\u2014as well as\nthe so-called internal senses\u2014common sense, phantasia\nand memory. By contrast, the intellectual faculty is separate, i.e.,\nwith respect to the body, because it does not depend for its operation\non bodily organs, even though it is triggered by a representation\nobtained from the senses. Accordingly, Simon, like Albert and Aquinas,\nrejects the position of those who, like Avicenna and Averroes, posit\nsome kind of metaphysical separation of the intellect from the human\nbody.\n",
