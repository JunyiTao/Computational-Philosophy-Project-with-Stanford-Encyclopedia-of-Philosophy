While James offered his own responses to many\nof these criticisms (see especially his 1909 [1975]), versions of\nthese objections often apply to other and more recent pragmatic\ntheories of truth (for further discussion see Haack 1976; Tiercelin\n2014).\n\nOne classic and influential line of criticism is that, if the\npragmatic theory of truth equates truth with utility, this definition\nis (obviously!) refuted by the existence of useful but false beliefs,\non the one hand, and by the existence of true but useless beliefs on\nthe other (Russell 1910 [1994] and Lovejoy 1908a,b). In short, there\nseems to be a clear and obvious difference between describing a belief\nas true and describing it as useful:\n\n\nwhen we say that a belief is true, the thought we wish to convey is\nnot the same thought as when we say that the belief furthers our\npurposes; thus \u201ctrue\u201d does not mean \u201cfurthering our\npurposes\u201d. (Russell 1910 [1994: 98])\n\n\nWhile this criticism is often aimed especially at James\u2019 account\nof truth, it plausibly carries over to any pragmatic theory. So\nwhether truth is defined in terms of utility, long-term durability or\nassertibility (etc.), it is still an open question whether a useful or\ndurable or assertible belief is, in fact, really true. In other words,\nwhatever concept a pragmatic theory uses to define truth, there is\nlikely to be a difference between that concept and the concept of\ntruth (e.g., Bacon 2014 questions the connection between truth and\nindefeasibility).\n\nA second and related criticism builds on the first. Perhaps utility,\nlong-term durability, and assertibility (etc.) should be viewed not as\ndefinitions but rather as criteria of truth, as yardsticks for\ndistinguishing true beliefs from false ones. This seems initially\nplausible and might even serve as a reasonable response to the first\nobjection above. Falling back on an earlier distinction, this would\nmean that appeals to utility, long-term durability, and assertibility\n(etc.) are best seen as answers to the justification and not the\nmetaphysical project. However, without some account of what truth is,\nor what the necessary and sufficient conditions for truth are, any\nattempt to offer criteria of truth is arguably incomplete: we cannot\nhave criteria of truth without first knowing what truth is. If so,\nthen the justification project relies on and presupposes a successful\nresolution to the metaphysical project, the latter cannot be\nsidestepped or bracketed, and any theory which attempts to do so will\ngive at best a partial account of truth (Creighton 1908; Stebbing\n1914).\n\nAnd a third objection builds on the second. Putting aside the question\nof whether pragmatic theories of truth adequately address the\nmetaphysical project (or address it at all), there is also a problem\nwith the criteria of truth they propose for addressing the\njustification project. Pragmatic theories of truth seem committed, in\npart, to bringing the concept of truth down to earth, to explaining\ntruth in concrete, easily confirmable, terms rather than the abstract,\nmetaphysical correspondence of propositions to truth-makers, for\nexample. The problem is that assessing the usefulness (etc.) of a\nbelief is no more clear-cut than assessing its truth: beliefs may be\nmore or less useful, useful in different ways and for different\npurposes, or useful in the short- or long-run. Determining whether a\nbelief is really useful is no easier than determining whether it\nis really true: \u201cit is so often harder to determine whether a\nbelief is useful than whether it is true\u201d (Russell 1910 [1994:\n121]; also 1946: 817). Far from making the concept of truth more\nconcrete, and the assessment of beliefs more straightforward,\npragmatic theories of truth thus seem to leave the concept as opaque\nas ever.\n\nThese three objections have been around long enough that pragmatists\nhave, at various times, proposed a variety of responses. One response\nto the first objection, that there is a clear difference between\nutility (etc.) and truth, is to deny that pragmatic approaches are\naiming to define the concept of truth in the first place. It has been\nargued that pragmatic theories are not about finding a word or concept\nthat can substitute for truth but that they are, rather, focused on\ntracing the implications of using this concept in practical contexts.\nThis is what Misak (2000, 2007a) calls a \u201cpragmatic\nelucidation\u201d. Noting that it is \u201cpointless\u201d to offer\na definition of truth, she concludes that \u201cwe ought to attempt\nto get leverage on the concept, or a fix on it, by exploring its\nconnections with practice\u201d (2007a: 69; see also Wiggins 2002).\nIt is even possible that James\u2014the main target of Russell and\nothers\u2014would agree with this response. As with Peirce, it often\nseems that James\u2019 complaint is not with the correspondence\ntheory of truth, per se, as with the assumption that the\ncorrespondence theory, by itself, says much interesting or important\nabout the concept of truth. (For charitable interpretations of what\nJames was attempting to say see Ayer 1968, Chisholm 1992, Bybee 1984,\nCormier 2001, 2011, Chang 2022, Pihlstr\u00f6m 2021, and Perkins\n1952; for a reading that emphasizes Peirce\u2019s commitment to\ncorrespondence idioms see Atkins 2010.)\n\nThis still leaves the second objection: that the metaphysical project\nof defining truth cannot be avoided by focusing instead on finding the\ncriteria for truth (the \u201cjustification project\u201d). To be\nsure, pragmatic theories of truth have often been framed as providing\ncriteria for distinguishing true from false beliefs. The distinction\nbetween offering a definition as opposed to offering criteria would\nsuggest that criteria are separate from, and largely inferior to, a\ndefinition of truth. However, one might question the underlying\ndistinction: as Haack (1976) argues,\n\n\nthe pragmatists\u2019 view of meaning is such that a dichotomy\nbetween definitions and criteria would have been entirely unacceptable\nto them. (1976: 236)\n\n\nIf meaning is related to use (as pragmatists generally claim) then\nexplaining how a concept is used, and specifying criteria for\nrecognizing that concept, may provide all one can reasonably expect\nfrom a theory of truth. Deflationists have often made a similar point\nthough, as noted above, pragmatists tend to find deflationary accounts\nexcessively austere.\n\nEven so, there is still the issue that pragmatic criteria of truth\n(whatever they are) do not provide useful insight into the concept of\ntruth. If this concern is valid, then pragmatic criteria, ironically,\nfail the pragmatic test of making a difference to our understanding of\ntruth. This objection has some merit: for example, if a pragmatic\ncriterion of truth is that true beliefs will stand up to indefinite\ninquiry then, while it is possible to have true beliefs, \u201cwe are\nnever in a position to judge whether a belief is true or not\u201d\n(Misak 2000: 57). In that case it is not clear what good it serves to\nhave a pragmatic criterion of truth. Pragmatic theories of truth might\ntry to sidestep this objection by stressing their commitment to both\nthe justification and the speech-act project. While pragmatic\napproaches to the justification project spell out what truth means in\nconversational contexts\u2014to call a statement true is to cite its\nusefulness, durability, etc.\u2014pragmatic approaches to the\nspeech-act project point to what speakers do in using the concept of\ntruth. This has the benefit of showing how the concept of\ntruth\u2014operating as a norm of assertion, say\u2014makes a real\ndifference to our understanding of the conditions on assertoric\ndiscourse. Pragmatic theories of truth are, as a result, wise to\npursue both the justification and the speech-act projects. By itself,\npragmatic approaches to the justification project are likely to\ndisappoint.\n\nThese classic objections to the pragmatic theory of truth raise\nseveral important points. For one thing, they make it clear that\npragmatic theories of truth, or at least some historically prominent\nversions of it, do a poor job if viewed as providing a strict\ndefinition of truth. As Russell and others noted, defining truth in\nterms of utility or similar terms is open to obvious counter-examples.\nThis does not bode well for pragmatic attempts to address the\nmetaphysical project. As a result, pragmatic theories of truth have\nevolved often by focusing on the justification and speech-act projects\ninstead. This is not to say that each of the above objections have\nbeen met. It is still an open question whether the metaphysical\nproject can be avoided as many pragmatic theories attempt to do (e.g.,\nFox 2008 argues that epistemic accounts such as Putnam\u2019s fail to\nexplain the value of truth as well as more traditional approaches do).\nIt is also an open question whether, as they evolve in response to\nthese objections, pragmatic theories of truth will invite new\nlines of criticism.\n",
