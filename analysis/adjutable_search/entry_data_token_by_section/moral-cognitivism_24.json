    "main_text": "Can The Cognitivist/Non-cognitivist Distinction Be Sustained? || Non-cognitivist Overreaching and Possible Collapse\n5.3 Non-cognitivist Overreaching and Possible Collapse\n\nOne final sort of worry about the distinctiveness of non-cognitivism\nis worthy of mention. This worry is that if too many domains of\ndiscourse are such that they require non-cognitive analysis, the\ncontrast between cognitive and non-cognitive domains on which the view\ndepends will be hard to sustain. Blackburn, for example, suggests\nquasi-realist approaches not just to moral discourse, but also to\nmodality, causation and probability. One may wonder what he means to\ndeny about these domains that is not also applicable to the rest of\nour seemingly contentful judgments (Rosen 1998). Huw Price, along with\nvarious others, has argued for global expressivism. (Price and\nO\u2019Leary-Hawthorne 1996; Macarthur and Price 2007; Price 2013,\n2015) On such views the notion that any language is representational\nis called into question. This kind of collapse is in danger of\nassimilating the putatively cognitive and the putatively non-cognitive\nfrom the other direction \u2013 by making the former look more like\nthe latter, rather than the other way around as with the worries about\nminimalism. Even Blackburn himself on occasion expresses worries about\nthis problem (Blackburn 1993, 34), but more commonly he and other\nnon-cognitivists resist the worry by pointing to other domains of\ndiscourse which are not amenable to non-cognitivist analysis. Simpson\n(2020) argues that the most promising version of global expressivism\nshould be understood so as not to contradict local expressivism.\n",
