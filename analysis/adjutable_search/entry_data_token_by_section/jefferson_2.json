Jefferson appeals to nature in what one scholar calls a\n\u201cmiddle landscape\u201d manner (Marx 1964: 104\u20135). The\nhappiest state for humans is one that seeks a middle ground between\nwhat is savage and what is \u201crefined.\u201d Jefferson\u2019s\nvision, thinks Marx, is Arcadian. Jefferson\u2019s aim, early\nwritings indicate (e.g., TJ to James Madison, 20 Dec. 1787 and [NV]:\n290\u201391), was for America to be a pastoral society that had the\nfreedom of primitivism, because it was neither materialist nor\nmanufacturing and it had an abundancy of land. America, because it was\nneither primitive nor uncultured, could have the trimmings of cultured\nsocieties, without their degenerative excesses.\n\nJefferson\u2019s natural-law theory is Stoical, not Hobbesian or\nRousseauian. For Jefferson, the basal laws of nature that obtain when\nman is in the state of nature are roughly the self-same laws that\nobtain in civil society. They are also roughly the same basal laws\nthat obtain between states.\n\n\nThe moral duties which exist between individual and individual in the\nstate of nature, accompany them into a state of society, and the\naggregate of the duties of all the individuals composing the society\nconstitutes the duties of that society towards any other; so that\nbetween society and society the same moral duties exist as did between\nindividuals composing them, while in an unassociated state, and their\nmaker not having released them from those duties on their forming\nthemselves into a nation ([F]: 423).\n\n\nThe ideological frame that allows for social stability is in the\nDeclaration of Independence, in which Jefferson lists two self-evident\ntruths: the equality of all men and their endowment of unalienable\nrights.\n\n\u201cEquality\u201d for Jefferson comprises equality of opportunity\nand moral equality. Equality of opportunity recognizes the differences\nbetween persons\u2014e.g., talents, prior social status, education,\nand wealth\u2014and seeks to level the playing field through\nrepublican reforms such as introduction of a bill to secure human\nrights; elimination of primogeniture, entails, and state-sanctioned\nreligion; periodic constitutional renewal; and and educational reform\nfor the self-sufficiency of the general citizenry. To remedy the\nunequal distribution of property, Jefferson advocates in his Draft\nConstitution for Virginia that 50 acres of property go to every male\n Virginian[5]\n ([CV]: 343). Moral equality recognizes that each human deserves equal\nstatus in personhood and citizenship, hence again the need of\nrepublican reforms of the sort listed above.\n\nRights are held to obtain, whether or not holders recognize them, and\nthey have a moral dimension apart from their obvious legal dimension.\nThere are, for instance, the moral obligations to obey the law and to\nrecognize and uphold the rights of\n others.[6]\n\nJefferson, mostly following Locke, mentions three unalienable rights\nin the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and pursuit of\nhappiness. The right to life constitutes a right to one\u2019s own\npersonhood. The rights to liberty and pursuit of happiness (Locke\nlists property instead of happiness) entail self-determination through\nlabor, art, industry, and self-governance. Government has no right to\ncontrol the lives of its citizens or dictate a course of happiness.\nTherein lies the foundation of Jeffersonian liberalism.\n\nThere is also the right to revolution, which entails the right to\nabolish any tyrannical form of government, given long abuses.\n",
