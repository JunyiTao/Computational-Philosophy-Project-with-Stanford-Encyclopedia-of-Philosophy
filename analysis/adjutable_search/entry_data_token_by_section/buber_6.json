Distance and Relation: Late Philosophical Anthropology\n\n\nResponding to the unfolding political chaos in Europe and to the\nstruggle between Jews and Arabs in Palestine, Buber\u2019s philosophical\noeuvre assumed a more occasionalist and essayistic form in the\nlate 1930s and 1940s. In addition to the works cited above and works\non religion, the Bible, and prophetic faith, his last major\nphilosophical publication was The Eclipse of God (1951). What\nunites all of the late works as a group is the common emphasis on\nphilosophical anthropology, the place of the individual person in the\nworld vis-\u00e0-vis other human beings in human community. Whether\nreflecting on \u201cman,\u201d \u201cthe Jew,\u201d or \u201cthe\nsingle one,\u201d always critical to Buber\u2019s late thought is the\ntension between distance and relation, and the role of mediated images\nin dialogical, open-ended, non-fixed relation to the social and\nnatural world. In this, Buber addressed, but never directly, the\ntension between \u201cfact\u201d and \u201cvalue,\u201d explored\nwith more rigor in later nineteenth- and early twentieth-century German\nphilosophy and in post-war Anglo-American analytic philosophy.\n\n\nOne of the signature pieces from this period is the essay on\nKierkegaard, \u201cThe Question to the Single One\u201d (1936). Buber\nturns to Kierkegaard in order to force the question of solipsism. For\nBuber, the Danish philosopher stands for a modern alienation from the\nworld. The question Buber asks is whether it is even possible to\nconceive of the human being as a \u201csingle one.\u201d According to\nBuber, Kierkegaard\u2019s love of God excludes the love of his\nneighbor, the fellow creature with whom we constitute \u201cthe\nworld\u201d in human terms. With his eye on the creation of Genesis,\nBuber describes man as a subject hovering over and embracing the\ncreaturely world. In this model, there is no renunciation of objects\nand political life. At the same time, relation does not mean the giving\noneself over to the crowd. The embrace of creaturely existence remains\nvexing. Buber characterizes the human being in terms of\n\u201cpotentiality\u201d within factual and finite limits, not in\nterms of the \u201cradicality\u201d he sees in Kierkegaard. That is\nto say, instead of positing a radical dichotomy between community and\nthe single one, Buber argues that they are compatible with, and\nnecessary for, one another.\n\n\nThis critique of the single one in relation to a larger social world\nbelongs to the world-picture established by Buber in the essay\n\u201cWhat is Man?\u201d (1938). At stake for Buber was a knowledge\nof the human person as a whole, i.e., a complete understanding of human\nsubjectivity. The methodological key to the essay is a philosophical\nanthropology. Buber assumed that only by entering\ninto the act of self-reflection can the philosophical anthropologist\nbecome aware of human wholeness based on a structural distinction\nbetween epochs of human habitation and epochs of human homelessness. In\nthe former, philosophical anthropology is cosmological, i.e.\nfundamentally related to the world and to human environments. In the\nlatter, human subjectivity is conceived of as self-standing and\nindependent. The conceptual tension is between being at home in a\nuniverse of things in contrast to what is presented as the collapse of\na rounded and unified world vis-\u00e0-vis self-divided forms of\nconsciousness. In order to preserve the imbrication of singular\nselfhood and the bonding of human personhood, Buber rejected the false\nchoice between individualism and collectivism. As Buber always\nunderstood it, human wholeness lies in the meeting of the one with the\nother in a living fourfold relation to things, individual persons, the\nmystery of Being, and self. Every living relation is essential and\ncontributes to human wholeness because human wholeness\n(\u201cman\u2019s unique essence\u201d) is known or posited only in\nliving out a set of relations.\n\n\nIf relationship constitutes the fundamental datum of human\nwholeness, it remains also true that relation was not understood by\nBuber independent of its conceptual antipode, namely\n\u201cdistance.\u201d As developed in the essay \u201cDistance and\nRelation\u201d (1951), relation cannot take shape apart from or without\nthe prior setting of things, persons, and spiritual beings at a\ndistance. For Buber, this setting of things, persons, and beings at a\ndistance is the only way to secure the form of otherness without which\nthere can be no relation. For without the form of otherness there can be no\nconfirmation of self insofar as the confirmation of the I is always\nmediated by the other who confirms me, both at a distance and in\nrelation, or rather in the distance that is relation and the relation\nthat is difference.\n\n\nWhile Buber most famously understood the I-Thou relationship as one\nbased on immediacy, he always steeped his thought in the power of\nmediating images and other plastic forms as the material stuff of\ninter-subjective relationship. In the essay \"Man and his Image-Work,\"\nBuber set out to understand something about the formation of images in\nrelation to the world, the world encompassed by art, faith, love, and\nphilosophy. Buber postulated three levels of world formation. The first\ntwo levels are the familiar Kantian concepts of a noumenal\n\u201cx\u201d world and a phenomenal sense-world of form, comprising\nthe world as shaped by and in images and concepts. Buber\u2019s\nconception of the third level, what he calls the world of perfect form,\nderives from the mystical tradition. This paradoxical level of world\nformation is expressed in terms of perfected form-relations. In art,\nfaith, and philosophy, the human image-work emerges out of relational\nencounters between persons and an independent \"world\" that exists on\nits own, but is not imaginable. \n\n\nThe concern about \u201cimages\u201d in relation to distance and\ndialogue surfaced again in Buber\u2019s last major work, The\nEclipse of God (1952). The so-called \u201ceclipse of God\u201d\nwas Buber\u2019s symbol for the spiritual crisis in postwar Western\ncivilization. It designated a philosophical collapse as much as a moral\none. Like Sartre and Heidegger, Buber directed his attention to\nconcrete existence. But unlike his fellow\n\u201cexistentialists,\u201d Buber was moved by the interaction\nbetween humans, individually and collectively, and an absolute reality\nthat exceeds the human imagination. Against Sartre, Heidegger, and also\nCarl Jung, Buber rejected the picture of self-enclosed human subjects\nand self-enclosed human life-worlds beyond which there are no external,\nindependent realities. Towards the end of his career as a writer and\nthinker, Buber sought to maintain the distinction and relation between\nthe human subject and an external other in order to\nsustain an ontological source of ethical value in opposition to the\nfalse absolutes of a modern world that had fused the absolute with the\npolitical and historical products of the human spirit.\n",
