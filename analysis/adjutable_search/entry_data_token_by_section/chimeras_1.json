    "main_text": "The Unnaturalness Argument\n2. The Unnaturalness Argument\n\n\nThe argument against chimeras most often discussed is the\nUnnaturalness Argument. It is also the argument against chimeras most\noften rejected. Taken in its most basic form, the Unnaturalness\nArgument alleges that because the creation of chimeras is unnatural it\nis therefore wrong. The source of the alleged unnaturalness lies in the\nfact that creating chimeras involves violating the natural species\nboundaries between humans and non-humans.\n\n\nSome criticisms of the Unnaturalness Argument focus on the\ndifficulties of defining \u201cspecies.\u201d As Jason Robert and\nFran\u00e7oise Baylis (2003) note, although species can be defined\nin terms of reproductive isolation, genetic isolation, shared\nancestry, or homeostatic property clusters, none of these definitions\ntakes precedence over the others. Rather, \u201cBiologists typically\nmake do with a plurality of species concepts, invoking one or the\nother depending on the particular explanatory or investigative\ncontext\u201d (Robert and Baylis 2003, 3).\n\n\nDefinitional difficulties, though, do not in and of themselves\nprovide reasons for thinking that a concept is morally irrelevant.\nThere are, after all, intractable disagreements about how to delineate\nmany key concepts relevant to ethics, including: killing and letting\ndie, life and death, consciousness, rationality, equality, justice,\nrespect, rights, and goodness.\n\n\nOther criticisms focus on the permeability and fluidity of the alleged\n\u201cboundary\u201d between species. Over long spans of time,\nspecies undergo fusion and fission and although wide-crosses (breeding\nbetween individuals of different species) are rare, they can occur\nwithout human intervention. Moreover, bacteria and viruses frequently\ntransfer genes between organisms without any human intervention in a\nprocess called \u201chorizontal gene transfer.\u201d\n\n\nThis criticism is certainly probative against those who believe that\nthe boundary between species is morally relevant because they hold a\n\u201cbiblical or Aristotelian view of species as fixed and immutable\nrather than being slices of a dynamic, ever-changing process\u201d\n(Rollin 2003, 15), but the proponent of the Unnaturalness Argument\nneed not hold such a view. For example, the groups constituting one\u2019s\nfamily and one\u2019s fellow citizens change over time, and yet we owe\nspecial duties to our compatriots and to our kin in virtue of our\nspecial relationships to them. So, fixed boundaries are not necessary\nfor moral relevance. And the mere fact that bacteria naturally\ntransfer genes across species boundaries does not mean that the\nactivity is natural when it is performed by humans.\n\n\nA better objection to the Unnaturalness Argument challenges the\nalleged link between unnaturalness and wrongfulness. Indeed, if\ncrossing species boundaries is sufficient for unnaturalness, and if\nunnaturalness is sufficient for wrongfulness, then the creation of\nmules and all other cross-species hybrids, even hybrid lilies, would\nbe wrong. On those definitions of \u201cunnatural\u201d that make\nhuman intervention sufficient for unnaturalness, the view that\nunnaturalness is sufficient for wrongfulness would entail the even\nmore outlandish conclusion that everything humans do is wrong. If the\nUnnaturalness Argument is to be at all plausible, it must avoid such\nimplications.\n\n\nThe alleged link between unnaturalness and wrongness can be\nsupported in two ways, depending on whether the Unnaturalness Argument\nis intended to be a so-called intrinsic objection or an extrinsic\nobjection. An intrinsic objection alleges that an act is wrong because\nof its intrinsic properties, whereas an extrinsic objection alleges\nthat an act is wrong because of its consequences. A person who claims\nthat it is unethical to feed a certain diet to an animal because the\ndiet is unnatural is presumably making an extrinsic objection: because\nthe diet is unnatural, it will not meet the nutritional requirements of\nthe animal and therefore it will have unacceptable consequences for the\nanimal\u2019s health. A person who claims that the unnaturalness of\nbestiality makes it unethical, even when it does not cause any harm or\npain, is presumably making an intrinsic objection.\n\n\nIf the Unnaturalness Argument is intended to be an extrinsic\nobjection, the link between unnaturalness and wrongness will most\nlikely be supported by pointing to possible adverse consequences for\nthe environment, public health, or the animal subject itself. Adverse\nenvironmental consequences have not received much discussion, probably\nbecause they are presumed to be adequately managed through standard\nguidelines and regulations regarding the use of animals in laboratory\nresearch. The possibility of a public health crisis arising from a\ntransmissible infection crossing species boundaries, a significant\nconcern with xenotransplantation, is greatly reduced when the source\nof the biological material is human and the recipient a non-human\nanimal confined to a laboratory. (It should be noted, though, that\ntransmission of a porcine virus to human cells in a human/porcine\nchimera has already been demonstrated (Ogle et al. 2004).)\nAdverse consequences for the animal are important to address, but\ntheir implications will depend on the moral status of the animal, an\nissue addressed by the Borderline-Personhood Argument. On any of these\nbases of support, the proponent of an extrinsic unnaturalness argument\nwould not be committed to the conclusion that everything unnatural is\nunethical, since unnaturalness is not necessarily connected with these\nkinds of bad consequences, and even when it is connected with bad\nconsequences, the act may be justified on other grounds. \n\n\nThe Unnaturalness Argument is more commonly interpreted as being an\nintrinsic objection. Even as an intrinsic objection, though, it still\nmight take a direct or an indirect form. A person who thinks that\npromise-breaking is intrinsically wrong might think that\npromise-breaking itself is the wrong-making property, or they might\nbelieve that promise-breaking is intrinsically wrong because it is the\nbetraying of an induced expectation (Scanlon 1998; Pratt, 2001), which\nitself is the wrong-making property. On the latter view,\npromise-breaking is still intrinsically wrong because the betraying of\nan induced expectation is not a consequence of a prior and distinct act\nof breaking a promise; rather, in those circumstances, the breaking of\na promise is identical to the betraying of an induced expectation. The\nontological relationship between the two acts is not analogous to that\nbetween pulling the trigger and a person\u2019s death but rather to that\nbetween pulling the trigger and firing the gun. Similarly, those who\nbelieve that it is wrong to create chimeras because doing so is\nunnatural might claim that the intrinsic wrongness of these acts stems\ndirectly from their unnaturalness or they might think that the link\nbetween unnaturalness and wrongness is mediated by another property. As\nJohn Stuart Mill observed, concerns about unnaturalness are, for many,\nderived from concerns about offense to God:\n\n\n\nThe consciousness that whatever man does to improve his condition is\nin so much a censure and a thwarting of the spontaneous order of\nNature, has in all ages caused new and unprecedented attempts at\nimprovement to be generally at first under a shade of religious\nsuspicion; as being in any case uncomplimentary, and very probably\noffensive to the powerful beings (or, when polytheism gave place to\nmonotheism, to the all-powerful Being) supposed to govern the various\nphenomena of the universe, and of whose will the course of nature was\nconceived to be the expression. (Mill 1958 [1847], 14)\n\n\n\nThe content of God\u2019s will with regard to the manipulation of nature,\nthough, is subject to speculation on both sides. Gary Comstock, for\nexample, defends the use of recombinant DNA techniques against the\nobjection that it constitutes playing God:\n\n\n\nIf humans are made in the divine image, and if God desires that we\nexercise the spark of divinity within us, then it should be no surprise\nthat inquisitiveness in science is part of our nature. . .. It is\nunclear why the desire to investigate and manipulate the chemical bases\nof life should not be considered as much a manifestation of our\nGod-like nature as the writing of poetry and the playing of sonatas\nshould be. (Comstock 2000, 185)\n\n\n\nNo matter whether the proponent of an intrinsic unnaturalness argument\nbelieves that the link is direct or mediated, she will still not be\ncommitted to thinking that all unnatural acts are wrong. Even if the\nwrongness stems directly from the unnaturalness, this leaves open the\npossibility that something unnatural could be justified by\nsufficiently strong countervailing considerations, such as those\nprovided by medical benefit or scientific knowledge. The same holds if\nthe link is mediated, with the additional caveat that unnaturalness\nmay not be invariably correlated with the actual wrong-making\nproperty. As Mill noted, the proponent of the Unnaturalness Argument\nneed only object to attempts \u201cto exercise power over\nnature beyond a certain degree and a certain admitted\nrange\u201d (1958 [1847], 15, emphasis added). There is also the\npossibility that the moral relevance of properties, unnaturalness\nincluded, can vary from context to context (See Dancy 1993). In short,\nit could be true that creating chimeras is wrong because it is\nunnatural even though not everything unnatural is wrong.\n\n\nConceding that unnaturalness is not sufficient for wrongness, however,\nopens the proponent of the Unnaturalness Argument to a further\nchallenge, that of providing principled grounds for distinguishing\nbetween those cases in which an act is wrong because it is unnatural\nand those cases in which an act is unnatural but not wrong, and of\nshowing that creating chimeras falls into the former category. If the\nUnnaturalness Argument is intended as an extrinsic objection, there\nare several detailed frameworks available for addressing risks to\npublic health, the environment, or the non-human animal research\nsubject. Any extrinsic Unnaturalness Argument is free to apply those\nframeworks to chimeras, but will be incomplete until it actually does\nso. If the Unnaturalness Argument is intended as an intrinsic\nobjection, then Paul Thompson\u2019s observation regarding intrinsic\nobjections to the use of recombinant DNA techniques states the problem\nsuccinctly: \u201cno one has succeeded in articulating a principled way of\nstating why the unnaturalness associated with the manipulation of DNA\nis unethical, while ordinary plant and animal breeding, computers and\nmodern transport are not\u201d (Thompson 2000, 9).\n\n\nAt this stage in the dialectic, the Unnaturalness Argument can be\nsupplemented by considerations of the \u201cyuck factor.\u201d\nProponents of the yuck factor argue that the reaction some people\nexperience in contemplating certain acts sometimes suffices for\nknowing that the act is wrong, even in the absence of satisfactory\njustification for the reaction (Kass 1998, 687). So proponents of an\nintrinsic unnaturalness argument can insist that in spite of not being\nable to provide principled grounds for distinguishing between the two\nkinds of cases, they still know that creating chimeras is\nwrong. Again, this conclusion is potentially supported by the\nliterature on moral particularism, which allows that a property\u2019s\nmoral relevance can vary not only from context to context, but also in\na way not capturable by a general theory (Dancy 1993).\n\n\nSome have argued that the yuck factor has been discredited because it\nhas been used to rationalize discrimination (Thompson 2000). Racists\nclaimed to \u201cknow simply by looking\u201d that interracial\nmarriages were wrong. But the fact that an argument has been used\ninappropriately in some areas does not mean that it is inappropriate\nin other areas.  Paternalistic arguments were used to rationalize\nunjust treatment of women and racial minorities, but that does not mean\nthat they are inappropriate when applied to toddlers.\n\n\nEven opponents of the yuck factor must concede that, sometimes, we\nknow that an action is wrong merely on the basis of our reaction to it,\neven if we cannot satisfactorily justify that reaction. We know it is\nwrong to kill a healthy person so that his organs can be transplanted\nto save five lives, even though we presently lack any theoretically\nsatisfactory way of distinguishing that case from the various trolley\ncases prominent in the killing/letting-die literature. (See Kamm (2006)\nfor recent discussion.)\n\n\nSo appealing to the yuck factor can insulate an intrinsic\nUnnaturalness Argument from the most common objections. It does so,\nhowever, at significant cost. By conceding that unnaturalness is not\nsufficient for wrongfulness while failing to provide any positive\nargument for thinking that unnaturalness in the particular case of\nchimeras makes them wrong, the proponent of an intrinsic Unnaturalness\nArgument is reduced to the bald assertion that chimeras are wrong\nbecause they are unnatural. This fails to provide any reasons\nwhatsoever to those who do not already share that view. The many\npeople, then, who think that the unnaturalness of a chimera does not\nmake it unethical to create them are in no way epistemically\nirresponsible in simply rejecting the argument out of hand. Moreover,\nthe intrinsic Unnaturalness Argument differs from the killing/letting\ndie example given above in a significant way: although it is true that\nwe presently lack any theoretically satisfactory way of distinguishing\nbetween the organ transplantation case and the various trolley cases,\nwe can nonetheless go a long way towards explaining why it is wrong to\nkill a healthy person so that their organs can be transplanted. We can\ntalk about the harm of death, the frustration of future interests, the\nloss of valuable opportunities, the right not to be killed, and so on.\nBut why think that the mere fact that an activity is unnatural makes\nit intrinsically wrong, or even provides any reason whatsoever for\nthinking so? It is hard to even begin to make the case, at least in\nsecular terms. Although some maintain that certain patterns of\ninference from an \u201cis\u201d to an \u201cought\u201d are valid\n(see Thomson 1990, 1\u201333, for discussion), inferring that\nsomething is even prima facie intrinsically wrong from the particular\nfact that it is not natural certainly seems fallacious. An intrinsic\nUnnaturalness Argument, therefore, is in a much weaker epistemic\nposition than an argument for the conclusion that it is wrong to kill\na healthy person for his or her organs.\n",
