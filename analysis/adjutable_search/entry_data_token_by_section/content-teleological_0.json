    "main_text": "Broad Aims\n1. Broad Aims\n\nMany (perhaps all) mental states are about things, or are directed on\nto things, in the way that a belief that spring is coming is about\nspring coming, or in the way that a desire for chocolate is directed\non to chocolate. In the terminology re-introduced into philosophy by\nFranz Brentano (1874/1924), such mental states exhibit\nintentionality. Alternatively, they can be characterized as\nrepresentational states, or states with representational content.\nPrima facie, the fact that mental states have content, i.e. the fact\nthat they exhibit this particular form of directedness towards the\nworld, is rather mysterious. Teleological theories of mental content,\nlike other theories of mental content, attempt to dispel this mystery:\nthey aim to explain how mental states can be about things, directed on\nto things, or represent \n things.[1]\n\n\nIn pursuing this aim, proponents of teleological theories usually\nadopt a physicalist framework, and try to formulate a theory of\ncontent that is naturalistic, or in other words a theory that is\nconsistent with the natural sciences and their presumed working\nassumption that neither intentionality nor consciousness is\nontologically fundamental. Most teleological theories thus attempt to\nshow how intentionality, at its most fundamental, can be part of the\nnatural world, by showing how it can be understood as deriving from\nother (non-mental) natural things.\n\nIn general, it is helpful to distinguish between two key questions\nthat teleological theorists are trying to answer. First, there is the\nrepresentational status question: in virtue of what do\nrepresentational states count as representational, i.e. what makes it\nthe case that these states have some content or other, rather than\nhaving no content at all? Secondly, there is the\ncontent-determination question: in virtue of what do\nrepresentational states have the content they have, i.e. what makes it\nthe case that these states have this specific content rather\nthan some other content? A full teleological theory needs to address\nboth of these questions, although (as we will see) there has been a\ntendency in the debate to focus on the second one.\n\nOne important aspect of mental representations that a theory of mental\ncontent needs to account for is their so-called\n\u201cnormative\u201d nature. We may evaluate beliefs as true or\nfalse, memories as accurate or inaccurate, perceptions as veridical or\nillusory, desires as satisfied or not satisfied, and motor\ninstructions as correctly or incorrectly executed. The mental states\nwe evaluate in these ways count as true or false, accurate or\ninaccurate (etc.) by virtue of their contents, as well as by virtue of\nother things (such as the actual state of the world). For example, the\ntruth of a belief that today is sunny depends on whether it is sunny,\nbut also on it being a belief that today is sunny. If the content of\nthe belief were different (e.g., if it were a belief that today is\nhot) then its truth value might be different. The\n\u201cnormative\u201d nature of mental content poses at least a\nprima facie problem for all naturalistic theories of it, given the\nHumean warning against trying to derive prescriptive from descriptive\nfacts. Teleological theories share the strategy of explaining the\nnorms pertaining to mental content as deriving from so-called\nfunctional \u201cnorms\u201d, which are regarded as descriptive\nrather than prescriptive. We return to this in the next section.\n\nIn relation to the \u201cnormative\u201d nature of mental content,\nmuch attention is paid to the possibility of misrepresentation, since\nthe distinction between correct and incorrect representation is\narguably central. In fact, a capacity for misrepresentation is often\nregarded as essential for genuine representation (see esp. Grice\n1957). Some state B, for instance, can only be a belief that\ntoday is sunny if B is true when the day is sunny and false\nwhen the day is not sunny. In other words, B only\nqualifies as a representational state of this particular kind if it is\ncapable of misrepresenting the world under certain conditions. And the\nsame holds, mutatis mutandis, for representational states of most\nkinds.\n\nA distinction is sometimes made between representation of and\nrepresentation as. Whether or not teleological theories of\ncontent are concerned with representation as or of\ndepends on how those locutions are being used. Suffice it to say that\nteleological theories are generally offered as theories of referential\ncontent (i.e. of the kind of content that is tightly connected to\ntruth-, correctness- or satisfaction-conditions), rather than of\ncognitive content or mode of presentation.\n\nFurther, the proponents of teleological theories rarely believe that\nreferential content is a kind of narrow content, and so they are not\nusually offering theories of narrow content. How to characterize\nnarrow content is controversial, but the proponents of teleological\ntheories tend to agree with those who think that two beings who are\nphysical replicas at a time t \u201cfrom the skin in\u201d,\nso to speak, can differ in the referential contents of their mental\nstates at t. Of course, this view is also shared by plenty of\nother philosophers, who think that mental reference to content\nsupervenes (in part) on things that are external to the individuals\nwhose mental states are in question, such as on features of their\nsocial or physical environments and/or learning histories (perhaps for\nthe reasons given by Putnam 1975 and Burge 1979, 1986). Still, a\nteleological theory of mental reference to content could be combined\nwith the view that there is also a useful notion of narrow\ncontent. (See the entry on\n narrow mental content.)\n\nA final point about broad aims is that teleological theories of mental\ncontent are usually intended as real nature theories. Those who offer\nreal nature theories of intentional mental states think that our\neveryday ability to recognize the intentional mental states of\nourselves and others does not make us experts on the fundamental\nnature of these intentional mental states, any more than our everyday\nability to recognize water makes us experts on the fundamental nature\nof water. Teleological theories of mental content do not entail that,\nif Bill thinks that Mavis knows that today is Tuesday, then Bill must,\nin so thinking, be thinking that certain teleological functions\npertain to Mavis\u2019s cognitive system.\n",
