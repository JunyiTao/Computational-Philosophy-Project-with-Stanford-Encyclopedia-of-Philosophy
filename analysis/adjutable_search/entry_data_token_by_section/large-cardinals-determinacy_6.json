    "main_text": "Classical Descriptive Set Theory || Historical Overview\n2.1  Historical Overview\n\nOne reason for concentrating on definable sets of reals is that it\nis generally easier to gain insight into definable sets of reals than\narbitrary sets of reals and, furthermore, there is hope that this\ninsight will shed light on the latter. For example, in one of the\nearliest results in the subject, Cantor and Bendixson showed that\nevery closed set is either countable or has the size of the continuum;\nin other words, the closed sets satisfy CH. \n\n The main origins of the subject lie in the early 20th\ncentury in the work of the French analysts Borel, Baire, and\nLebesgue. The subject grew into an independent discipline through the\nwork of the Russian mathematician Luzin (who had learned of the\nsubject as a student while in Paris) and was developed by his\nstudents, most notably Suslin. The end of this early period of\ndescriptive set theory was marked by a major theorem proved by the\nJapanese mathematician Kond\u00f4 in 1937. After nearly 40 years of\ndevelopment, progress came to an abrupt halt. The explanation for this\nwas eventually provided by the independence results of G\u00f6del and\nCohen (in 1938 and 1963). For, using this machinery, it was shown that\nthe open questions that the early descriptive set theorists were\ntrying to answer could not be resolved on the basis of the standard\naxioms of mathematics, ZFC. It is a testament to the ingenuity of the\nearly descriptive set theorists that they had developed their subject\nright up to the edge of undecidability. \n\n The independence results of G\u00f6del and Cohen thus showed that\nif one wished to develop descriptive set theory further then one must\ninvoke additional axioms. There were two main approaches, each of\nwhich led to a rebirth of descriptive set theory. The first approach\nwas to invoke axioms of definable determinacy. The axiom of\ndeterminacy (AD) was introduced by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962 and\nit was quickly seen to yield generalizations of the results of\nclassical descriptive theory. Unfortunately, AD contradicts AC and for\nthis reason it was never really proposed as a new axiom. However,\nSolovay and Takeuti pointed out that there is a natural such\nsubuniverse, namely, L(\u211d), in which AD could hold,\nconsistently with assuming AC in the full universe. This led to a\nhierarchy of axioms of definable determinacy that underwent\nintensive investigation in the 1970s and 1980s. The main sources for\nthis period are Moschovakis (1980) and the volumes of the Cabal\nseminar during 1977\u20131985. The second approach was to\ninvoke large cardinal axioms. This approach was initiated by\nSolovay in 1965. Finally, in the late 1960s Solovay conjectured that\nlarge cardinal axioms actually imply axioms of definable\ndeterminacy. If true, this would open the way for a unification of the\ntwo approaches. This hope was realized in the work of Martin, Steel,\nand Woodin from 1984 onward. \n\nFurther Reading: For more on the history of classical\ndescriptive set theory see Kanamori (1995). \n",
