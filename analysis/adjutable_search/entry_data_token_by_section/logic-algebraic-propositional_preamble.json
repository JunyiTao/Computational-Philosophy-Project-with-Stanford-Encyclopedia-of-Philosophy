    "main_text": "\n\nGeorge Boole was the first to present logic as a mathematical theory\nin algebraic style. In his work, and in that of the other algebraists\nof the algebraic tradition of logic of the nineteenth century, the\ndistinction between a formal language and a mathematically rigorous\nsemantics for it was still not drawn. What the algebraists in this\ntradition did was to build algebraic theories (of Boolean algebras,\nand relation algebras) with among other interpretations a logical\none.\n\nThe works of Frege and Russell introduced a different perspective on\nthe way to approach logic. In those works, a logic system was given by\na formal language and a deductive calculus, namely a set of axioms and\na set of inference rules. Let us (for this entry) call such a pair a\nlogical deduction system, and the formulas derivable in the\ncalculus its theorems (nowadays it is common practice in\nalgebraic logic to refer to this type of calculi as Hilbert-style and\nin proof complexity theory as Frege systems). In Frege and\nRussell\u2019s approach, a formal (mathematical) semantics of\nwhatever kind (algebraic, model-theoretic, etc.) for the formal\nlanguages they used was lacking. The only semantics present was of an\nintuitive, informal kind.\n\nThe systems introduced by Frege and Russell were systems of classical\nlogic, but soon after systems of non-classical logics were considered\nby other logicians. The first influential attempts to introduce logics\ndifferent from classical logic remained within the Frege-Russell\ntradition of presenting a logical deduction system without any formal\nsemantics. These attempts lead to the first modal systems of C.I.\nLewis (1918, 1932) and to the axiomatization of intuitionistic logic\nby Heyting (1930).\n\nThe idea underlying the design of Frege and Russell\u2019s logical\ndeduction systems is that the theorems should be the formulas that\ncorrespond (intuitively) to the logical truths or logical validities.\nThe concept of logical consequence was not central to the development,\nand this was also the case in the many systems of non-classical logics\nthat were to be designed following in the footsteps of the first modal\nsystems of C.I. Lewis. This situation influenced the way in which the\nresearch on some non-classical logics has usually been presented and\nsometimes also its real evolution. However, the concept of logical\nconsequence has been the one that logic has traditionally dealt with.\nTarski put it once again into the center of modern logic, both\nsemantically and syntactically. Nowadays, a general theory of the\nalgebraization of logics around the concept of logical consequence has\ngrown from the different algebraic treatments of the different logics\nobtained during the last century.\n\nThe concept of logical consequence has proved much more fruitful than\nthose of theorem and of logical validity for the development of such a\ngeneral theory. The first attempts in the process of building the\ngeneral theory of the algebraization of logics can be found in the\nstudy of the class of implicative logics by Rasiowa (1974) and in the\nsystematic presentation by W\u00f3jcicki (1988) of the\ninvestigations of a general nature on propositional logics as\nconsequence operations carried out mainly by Polish logicians,\nfollowing the studies of Tarski, Lindenbaum, \u0141ukasiewicz and\nothers in the first part of the twentieth century.\n\nIt was only in the 1920s that algebras and logical matrices (an\nalgebra together with a set of designated elements) started to be\ntaken as models of logical deduction systems, that is, as providing a\nformal semantics for formal languages of logic. Moreover, they were\nalso used to define sets of formulas with similar properties to the\nones the sets of theorems of the known logical deduction systems have,\nin particular the property of being closed under substitution\ninstances; soon after  logical matrices were also  used to\ndefine logics as consequence relations.\n\nAlgebraic logic can be described in very general terms as the\ndiscipline that studies logics by associating with them classes of\nalgebras, classes of logical matrices and other algebra related\nmathematical structures and that relates the properties that the\nlogics may have with properties of the associated algebras (or algebra\nrelated structures) with the purpose that the understanding of these\nalgebras can be used to better understand the logic at hand.\n\nFrom the algebraic study of particular logics, a general theory of the\nalgebraization of logics slowly emerged during the last century with\nthe aim, more or less explicitly stated during the process, of\nobtaining general and informative results relating the properties a\nlogic may have with the algebraic properties the class of algebras (or\nalgebra related structures) associated with it might enjoy. Those\nalgebraic studies assumed somehow an implicit conception of what is\nthe process by which to associate with any given logic a class of\nalgebras as its natural algebraic counterpart. The development of that\ngeneral theory speeded up and consolidated at the beginning of the\n1980s with the introduction of the notion of algebraizable logic, and\nat that time also the assumptions about the class of algebras that\ndeserves to be taken as the natural one to associate with a given logic\nstarted to be made more and more explicit.\n\nIn this entry we concentrate on the general theory of the\nalgebraization of propositional logics taken as consequence relations.\nThis theory has evolved into the field known as Abstract Algebraic\nLogic (AAL). The entry can be taken as a mild introduction to this\nfield.\n",
