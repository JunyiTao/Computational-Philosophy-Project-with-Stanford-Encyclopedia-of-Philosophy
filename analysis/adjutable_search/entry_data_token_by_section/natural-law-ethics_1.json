    "main_text": "Key Features of Natural Law Theories || Natural law and divine providence\n1.1 Natural law and divine providence\n\nWhile our main focus will be on the status of the natural law as\nconstituting the principles of practical rationality, we should\nconsider for a moment at least the importance within Aquinas\u2019s\nview of the claim that the natural law is an aspect of divine\nprovidence. The fundamental thesis affirmed here by Aquinas is that\nthe natural law is a participation in the eternal law (ST IaIIae 91,\n2). The eternal law, for Aquinas, is that rational plan by which all\ncreation is ordered (ST IaIIae 91, 1); the natural law is the way that\nthe human being \u201cparticipates\u201d in the eternal law\u00a0\n(ST IaIIae 91, 2). While nonrational beings have a share in the\neternal law only by being determined by it \u2014 their action\nnonfreely results from their determinate natures, natures the\nexistence of which results from God\u2019s will in accordance with\nGod\u2019s eternal plan \u2014 rational beings like us are able to\ngrasp our share in the eternal law and freely act on it\u00a0 (ST\nIaIIae 91, 2). It is this feature of the natural law that justifies,\non Aquinas\u2019s view, our calling the natural law\n\u2018law.\u2019\u00a0 For law, as Aquinas defines it (ST IaIIae 90,\n4), is a rule of action put into place by one who has care of the\ncommunity; and as God has care of the entire universe, God\u2019s\nchoosing to bring into existence beings who can act freely and in\naccordance with principles of reason is enough to justify our thinking\nof those principles of reason as law.\n",
