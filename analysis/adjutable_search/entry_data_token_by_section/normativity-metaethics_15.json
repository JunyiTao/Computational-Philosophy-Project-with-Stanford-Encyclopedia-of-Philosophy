    "main_text": "Attempts to Explain the Nature of Normativity || Explaining Normativity via Desire-based reasons\n4.2 Explaining Normativity via Desire-based reasons\n\nA widespread view is that normative facts are analyzable in terms of\nfacts about reasons. So in this and the next sections, we investigate\nattempts to explain the nature of normativity by explaining the nature\nof reasons.\n\nIt is widely thought that a person has reason to satisfy her desires.\nOn this view, for instance, if I want some ice cream, I have reason to\nget some. Some philosophers hold that all practical reasons are\nbasically of this nature. The basic idea is that practical reasons are\nessentially facts about desire satisfaction, but there are different\nversions of the idea. For example, some would insist that the desires\nin question are not necessarily the desires that a person actually\nhas, but are instead ones that she would have if she were fully\ninformed and if she brought all relevant facts vividly to mind (Brandt\n1979). See the entry on\n reasons for action: internal vs. external.\n\nOne might combine the idea that normative facts are analyzable in\nterms of facts about reasons with the idea that practical reasons are\nessentially facts about desire satisfaction. On this basis, one might\nconclude that all normative facts are fundamentally facts about desire\nsatisfaction \u2013 or informed desire satisfaction, or the like. One\nmight then propose that the normativity of a fact consists in its\nbeing analyzable as a fact (of some relevant kind) about desire\nsatisfaction. This then would point the way toward a naturalistic\nconstitutive explanation of normativity. This basic strategy has been\ndeveloped in detail by Mark Schroeder (2007).\n\nViews of this kind would be classified as realist, if one had in mind\nwhat we earlier called \u201cbasic realism\u201d, or as irrealist or\nanti-realist, if one had in mind what we earlier called\n\u201cmind-independent realism\u201d. Sharon Street has a view of\nthis kind that she classifies as constructivist (2008, 2010).\n\nOne problem is that our second-order desires can conflict with our\nfirst-order ones. We can desire to get rid of some of our desires, for\nexample, and in this case it might seem that the latter desires\ndon\u2019t give us reason to satisfy them. Following Harry Frankfurt,\none might argue that only desires that are endorsed by higher order\ndesires, or at least not undermined by them, ground reasons (Frankfurt\n1971).\n\nThere are also attempts to undermine these approaches. Christine\nKorsgaard has argued, for example, that one has a reason to satisfy a\ndesire only if the object of the desire is something that is valuable\nitself, or something that will tend to promote something valuable\n(Korsgaard 1996).\n",
