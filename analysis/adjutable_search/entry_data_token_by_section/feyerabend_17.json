    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Later Work: Towards Relativism, but then Beyond It || Feyerabend in the Nineties\n5.4 Feyerabend in the Nineties\n\nIn the early 1990s, Feyerabend worked up a course of lectures he had\npreviously given in Berkeley into a series of five lectures entitled\n\u2018What is knowledge? What is science?\u2019. These were\noriginally delivered to a general audience, but later edited and\npublished by Eric Oberheim as a book entitled The Tyranny of\nScience [Feyerabend 2011]. \n\nThe main themes of the book are as follows. Scientists and\nphilosophers sometimes present science as a unified worldview, a\nmonolith (or a monster, depending on one\u2019s preferences). It is\nnot. Science is both incomplete and quite strongly disunified. It does\nnot speak with a single voice, therefore appeals to the abstraction\n\u2018Science\u2019 are out of place. The ideology known as\nobjectivism, or scientific materialism, which takes science to be our\nultimate measure of what exists, is therefore ungrounded. Its\ndefenders, who portray themselves as the defenders of Reason, are\noften the kind of intellectual imperialists whose attitudes and advice\nin the past led, or would have led, to the destruction of first-nation\ncommunities. \n\nOther equally popular philosophical claims about science are also\nflawed. The idea that science is successful needs interrogation.\nScience does have some successes, but these can be detached from the\nideology that seems to support them. The idea that science starts from\nfacts, and eschews theories until the facts are gathered, is a myth.\nThe same can be said of the idea that science is value-free, and also\nof the idea that scientific results are relevant to urgent social\nproblems. \n\nOne aspect of the disunity of science is that \u2018scientists\u2019\nshould not mean merely theoreticians: science also (and essentially)\nfeatures experimentalists. In their work the importance of hands-on\nexperience, and of what Michael Polanyi called \u2018tacit\nknowledge\u2019, is most obvious. But in fact these sorts of\nexperience and knowledge play an important role throughout the\nsciences, even in their most obviously theoretical parts. The\nPlatonic-rationalist picture of science as pure thinking about the\nnature of reality is a distortion.\n\nPerhaps the book\u2019s central complaint is that a particular\nabstract, theoretical, \u2018objectivist\u2019 kind of science,\ntogether with an associated kind of thinking about science, now\ndominate our thinking, excluding more human modes of thought.\nScientism, the belief that science has the answer to all meaningful\nquestions, is also a target. Feyerabend\u2019s typical strategy is to\ntake some hallowed idea (e.g., that the success of science is due to\nobservation and experiment), and ask: how did it arise? Tracing its\nancestry back to ancient Greek thinkers (usually Plato, Parmenides, or\nXenophanes), he assesses their arguments for it, and finds them\neminently resistible. His complaint is not that their arguments are\ninvalid, though\u2014that would be already to take on a\nquasi-scientific mode of assessment. Instead, Feyerabend makes it\nclear that he prefers \u2018stories\u2019 (or even\n\u2018fairytales\u2019) to arguments, and that rival stories are to\nbe assessed in terms of how interesting, appealing, or revealing they\nare. The sorts of stories the ancient Greek tragedians told, being\nmore obviously human, fare better on such measures than those of the\nancient Greek philosophers, so we should not assume that philosophers\nare our best guides in such matters. \n\nFeyerabend also published a surprisingly large number of papers in the\n1990s (although many of them were short ones with overlapping\ncontent). Several appeared in a new journal, Common\nKnowledge, in whose inauguration he had a hand, and which set out\nto integrate insights from all parts of the intellectual landscape.\n\n\nAlthough these papers were on scattered subjects, there are some\nstrong themes running through them, several of which bear comparison\nwith what gets called \u201cpost-modernism\u201d (see Preston 1998).\nHere I shall sketch only the main ones.\n\nOne of the projects which Feyerabend worked on for a long time, but\nnever really brought to completion, went under the name \u201cThe\nRise of Western Rationalism\u201d. Under this umbrella he hoped to\nshow that Reason (with a capital \u201cR\u201d) and Science had\ndisplaced the binding principles of previous world-views not\nas the result of having won an argument, but as the result of\npower-play. While the first philosophers (the pre-Socratic thinkers)\nhad interesting views, their attempt to replace, streamline or\nrationalise the folk-wisdom which surrounded them was eminently\nresistible. Their introduction of the appearance/reality dichotomy\nmade nonsense of many of the things people had previously known. Even\nnowadays, indigenous cultures and counter-cultural practices provide\nalternatives to Reason and that nasty Western science.\n\nHowever, Feyerabend sometimes also recognised that this is to present\nscience as too much of a monolith. In most of his work after\nAgainst Method, he emphasises what has come to be known as\nthe \u201cdisunity of science\u201d. Science, he insists, is a\ncollage, not a system or a unified project. Not only does it include\nplenty of components derived from distinctly\n\u201cnon-scientific\u201d disciplines, but these components are\noften vital parts of the \u201cprogress\u201d science has made\n(using whatever criterion of progress you prefer). Science is a\ncollection of theories, practices, research traditions and world-views\nwhose range of application is not well-determined and whose merits\nvary to a great extent. All this can be summed up in his slogan:\n\u201cScience is not one thing, it is many.\u201d\n\nLikewise, the supposed ontological correlate of science, \u201cthe\nworld\u201d, consists not only of one kind of thing but of countless\nkinds of things, things which cannot be \u201creduced\u201d to one\nanother. In fact, there is no good reason to suppose that the world\nhas a single, determinate nature. Rather we inquirers construct the\nworld in the course of our inquiries, and the plurality of our\ninquiries ensures that the world itself has a deeply plural quality:\nthe Homeric gods and the microphysicist\u2019s subatomic particles\nare simply different ways in which \u201cBeing\u201d responds to\n(different kinds of) inquiry. How the world is \u201cin-itself\u201d\nis for ever unknowable. In this respect, Feyerabend\u2019s last work\ncan be thought of as aligned with \u201csocial\nconstructivism\u201d.\n",
