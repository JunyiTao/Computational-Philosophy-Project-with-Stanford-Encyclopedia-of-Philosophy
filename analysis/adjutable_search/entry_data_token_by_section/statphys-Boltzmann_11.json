    "main_text": "Some later work || Return of the ergodic hypothesis\n5.1 Return of the ergodic hypothesis\n\n\nAs we have seen, the 1877 papers introduced some conceptual shifts in\nBoltzmann\u2019 approach. Accordingly, this year is frequently seen as a\nwatershed in Boltzmann's thinking. Concurrent with that view, one would\nexpect his subsequent work to build on his new insights and turn away\nfrom the themes and assumptions of his earlier papers. Actually,\nBoltzmann's subsequent work in gas theory in the next decade and a half\nwas predominantly concerned with technical applications of his 1872\nBoltzmann equation, in particular to gas diffusion and gas friction.\nAnd when he did touch on fundamental aspects of the theory, he returned\nto the issues and themes raised in his 1868\u20131871 papers, in particular\nthe ergodic hypothesis and the use of ensembles. \n\n\nThis step was again triggered by a paper of Maxwell, this time one\nthat must have pleased Boltzmann very much, since it was called \u201cOn\nBoltzmann's theorem\u201d (Maxwell 1879) and dealt with the theorem\ndiscussed in the last section of his (1868). He pointed out that this\ntheorem does not rely on any collision assumption. But Maxwell also\nmade some pertinent observations along the way. He is critical about\nBoltzmann's ergodic hypothesis, pointing out that \u201cit is manifest that\nthere are cases in which this does not take place\u201d (Maxwell 1879,\n694). Apparently, Maxwell had not noticed that Boltzmann's later\npapers had also expressed similar doubts. He rejected Boltzmann'a\ntime-average view of probability and instead preferred to interpret\n\u03c1 as an ensemble density. Further, he states that any claim that\nthe distribution function obtained was the unique stationary\ndistribution \u201cremained to be investigated\u201d (Maxwell 1879,\n722). Maxwell's paper seems to have revived Boltzmann's interest in\nthe ergodic hypothesis, which he had been avoiding for a decade. This\nrenewed confidence is expressed, for example in Boltzmann\n(1887):\nUnder all purely mechanical systems, for which equations\nexist that are analogous to the so-called second law of the mechanical\ntheory of heat, those which I and Maxwell have investigated \u2026\nseem to me to be by far the most important. \u2026 It is likely that\nthermal bodies in general are of this kind [i.e., they obey the\nergodic hypothesis]\n\n However, he does not return to this conviction in later work. His\nLectures on Gas Theory (1896,1898), for example, does not\neven mention the ergodic hypothesis.\n",
