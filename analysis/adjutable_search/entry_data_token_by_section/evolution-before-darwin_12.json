    "main_text": "Early Nineteenth-Century Transformism || Lamarckian Transformism\n4.1 Lamarckian Transformism\n\nIt is in this context, and through his position as the first holder of\nthe Chair of \u201cWorms\u201d that Jean Baptiste de Lamarck\ndeveloped during his tenure the first coherent theory of species\nchange over historical time, eventually known by the new\nterm\u2014transformisme. Lamarck in many respects warrants\nthe claim to be the first genuine evolutionary thinker situated within\na professional scientific institution.\n\nLamarck\u2019s theory of species transformism emerged gradually in\nhis annual Mus\u00e9um lectures on the \u201canimals\nwithout vertebrae\u201d that commenced in 1794. As the new occupant\nof the Chair dedicated to this vast array of forms, Lamarck undertook\nin 1794 a massive reorganization of the Mus\u00e9um\ncollections of these animals. To accomplish this, he adapted for their\ntaxonomic organization the method of arrangement of the plant groups\nhe had developed in his earlier work on French botany (Lamarck, 1778),\ncreated during his formative years when he worked in the\nJardin as a botanist. In this early botanical work he had\nordered groups serially from most complex flowering plants to most\nsimple fungi. Lamarck then adopted a similar method for his initial\narrangement of the invertebrate groups of animals.\n\nBut the complexity of the invertebrate groups prevented any simple\nlinear arrangement, and the complex classification of the\ninvertebrates Lamarck worked out provided him with an empirical base\nfrom which his transformist theory was subsequently developed\n(Burkhardt 1977). Expounded though his annual Mus\u00e9um\nlectures, Lamarck was able to develop these arguments in interaction\nwith the wide array of collections of invertebrate animals at the\nMus\u00e9um.\n\nIn view of the many interpretations of Lamarck\u2019s views that have\nemerged since the public presentations of his theory in his 1802\nR\u00e9cherches sur l\u2019organisation des corps vivants,\nand in developed form in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique\n(Zoological Philosophy, [Eng. 1914, 1963]), and in the\n\u201cIntroduction\u201d to his Histoire naturelle des animaux\nsans vert\u00e8bres (HASV, 1815\u20131822), the\nprimary features of Lamarck\u2019s reflections need to be carefully\ndetailed. In most fundamental terms, his theory of species change was\ntied to his reversal of the taxonomic ordering of forms\noriginally presented in his early systematic arrangements. In his\noriginal classifications, these groups were ordered in a series of\n\u201cprincipal masses\u201d (masses principales) that\nbegan with the most complex invertebrates forms (cephalopods) and\nterminated in the least organized (polyps\u2014hydra, sponges,\nanemones). By 1800, Lamarck decided that this ordering was artificial,\nand that the \u201cnatural\u201d arrangement was a complex series\nrunning from simpler forms to those more complex. The evolutionary\ntheory he subsequently developed involved the claim that this new\norder of arrangement was also representative of the historical\nsequence by which forms had been generated one from another over\ntime.\n\nThese novel conclusions were first presented in the\nMus\u00e9um lectures of 1800, and then were developed in\nmore detail in print in his Recherches (1802), with the full\nexposition in his Philosophie zoologique and the\nHASV. Some further significant elaborations of his ideas were\nthen expressed in his many articles for the second edition of Joseph\nVirey\u2019s Nouveau dictionnaire d\u2019histoire naturelle\n(1817\u201319) (Lamarck 1817\u201319 [1991]). His theoretical\nconclusions were also concretely displayed in the arrangement of\nspecimens in the main zoology gallery of the Mus\u00e9um\nover which he had primary control. The following claims formed the\ncore of his mature theory:\n\n The origin of living beings is initially through spontaneous\ngeneration. This action is confined, however, to the origins of the\nmost structurally-simple forms of life\u2014infusoria and polyps. All\nsubsequent forms necessarily havae developed in some way in time from\nthe elementary beginning in these simplest forms.\n The causal agency behind this \u201cascending\u201d, rathr than\n\u201cdegenerating\u201d, history of life over time is supplied by\nthe activity of dynamic material agencies\u2014caloric and electrical\nfluids. The entry of these active material agencies into inorganic\nmatter produces the spontaneous generation of the elementary plants,\nthe microscopic infusoria, and the simplest polyps. This also provides\nthe causal impetus by which these simple forms can give rise to forms\nof higher complexity, moving to the radiarians, and so on up the\nseries. Moving beyond the distinction of \u201cinert\u201d and\n\u201cliving\u201d matter of his mentor Buffon, Lamarck\u2019s\ntheories generally can be considered \u201cvitalist\u201d in\ninspiration, in that they attribute a genuine dynamism to living\nmatter and grant it the ability to create new forms and structures\nthrough its inherent powers. Lamarck denied, however, any appeal to\nspecial supperadded vital forces, and his reliance on the causal role\nof dyanmic Newtonian aetherial fluids grounded his theory on a concept\nof active matter that can be termed a theory of \u201cvital\nmaterialism\u201d.\n The Lamarckian \u201cseries\u201d that underlies Lamarckian\ntransformism is not a linear series of species and genera, but a\nhierarchy of primary organizational plans that emerge from\nlesser-organized plans. This moves generally from simpler forms to the\nmore complex and results withint the animal kingdom in an axis of\nfourteen primary groups, terminating in the higher vertebrates, the\nmammals. This parallels the \u201cnatural\u201d order of\nclassification of groups he had developed in his taxonomic system.\nPosition in the series is defined primarily in terms of the structural\nand functional elaboration of the nervous system. Also involved in\nthis dynamic ordering of groups, but only at the highest levels, are\nthe internal functions of \u201cwill\u201d and \u201ceffort\u201d\nin the development of life.\n The best-known feature of Lamarkism in the subsequent\ntradition\u2014the theory of transformism via the inheritance of\nacquire characters\u2014functions as a subordinate, diversifying\nprocess through which major animal groups are adapted to local\ncircumstances through the elaboration of different species. Such\nadaptation is not, however, the primary cuase of transformation from\ngroup to group up the series. Consequently, in contrast to\nDarwin\u2019s later theory, the primary evolution of life is not\nthrough local adaptation.\n Major transformation between lesser groups may, however, occur\nthrough the action of the use and disuse of structures. For example,\nthe transformation of primates into humans presumably has occurred by\nmeans of this adaptive process accompanied by an internal power of the\nwill.\n\n\nThe complex arrangement and ordering of groups envisioned by Lamarck\nwas a branching image of group development illustrated by the\nfollowing diagram added to his Zoological Philosophy.\nPossibly responding to the analyses by his younger colleague Georges\nCuvier directed at the concept of linear relationships of groups (see\nbelow), Lamarck admitted a more complex branching pattern of group\nrelations, with some showing independent lineages and even different\npoints of origin:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Lamarck Diagram from\n\u201cAdditions\u201d to the Philosophie zoologique, first\nedition (1809), (page 463). [An\n extended description of figure 1\n is in the supplement.] \n\n\nThis issue was not, however, developed in any theoretical elaboration\nby Lamarck himself. The complexity of these issues in the subsequent\ninterpretations of Lamarck by his successors is an area of active\nresearch (Corsi, 2021, 2012; Jenkins 2019).\n",
