    "main_text": "William of Ockham || Freedom of Discussion within the Church\n13.5 Freedom of Discussion within the Church\n\nIn part I of his Dialogus, books\n 3\n and\n 4\n (c. 1334) Ockham discusses heresy and heretics, arguing that for\nsomeone to be a heretic it is not enough that something that person\nbelieves is heresy, he or she must also believe it\n\u201cpertinaciously\u201d, and to discover pertinacity it is often\nnecessary to enter into discussion to find whether the person is ready\nto abandon the error when it is shown to be such. For example, a\nlayperson who believes undogmatically a doctrine that is in fact\nheresy, until it has been shown to be heresy in a way adapted to that\nperson\u2019s understanding, may maintain it \u201ca thousand\ntimes\u201d, even in the face of contradiction by bishop or pope,\nwithout being a heretic\n (1 Dialogus 4.23).\n On the other hand, a pope who tries to impose a false doctrine on\nothers is known to be pertinacious precisely from the fact that he is\ntrying to impose false doctrine on others, and a pope who becomes a\nheretic automatically ceases to be pope. Thus ordinary Christians (or\na pope arguing as a theologian and not purporting to exercise papal\nauthority) can argue for a heresy as long as they are open to evidence\nand make no attempt to impose their belief on others, whereas a pope\nwho tries to impose a heresy immediately ceases to be pope and loses\nall authority. Christians must defend dissidents who are upholding a\nposition that may possibly be the truth against a possibly heretical\npope, until the uncertainty is resolved by discussion. This is an\nargument for freedom of discussion within the Church, though not for\ntoleration in general (McGrade 1974: 47\u201377; McGrade, Kilcullen,\nand Kempshall 2001: 484\u201395; Kilcullen 2010a).\n",
