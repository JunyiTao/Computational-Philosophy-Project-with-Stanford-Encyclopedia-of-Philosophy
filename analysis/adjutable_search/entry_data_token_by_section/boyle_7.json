    "main_text": "Boyle\u2019s World View || What kind of world is it that God created?\n3.2 What kind of world is it that God created?\n\nGod created a material world in time and space, but what kind of\nmatter, what kind of space, what kind of time? As to the matter, Boyle\nagreed with contemporaries such as Huygens and Newton that\n\u201cMatter [is] in its own Nature but\n one.\u201d[41]\n However Boyle, cautious as ever, explicitly allows God the\npossibility of creating matter which is not like ordinary\nmatter, and instituting laws which are quite unlike the laws that\nobtain on earth. His views are worth quoting at length:\n\n\n[T]he World must every way have bounds, and consequently be finite; or\nit must not have bounds, and so be \u2026 infinite. And if\nthe World be bounded, then those that believe a\n Deity,[42]\n to whose Nature it belongs to be of infinite Power, must not deny\nthat God was, and still\n is,[43]\n able to make other Worlds than this of ours. \u2026\n\nNow if we grant, with some modern Philosophers, that God has made\nother Worlds besides this of ours, it will be highly probable that he\nhas there display\u2019d His manifold Wisdom, in productions very\ndiffering from those wherein we here admire it. And even without\nsupposing any more than one Universe, as all that portion of it that\nis visible to us, makes but a part of that vastly extended aggregate\nof bodies: So if we but suppose, that some of the Celestial Globes,\nwhether visible to us, or plac\u2019d beyond the reach of our sight,\nare peculiar Systemes, the consideration will not be very different.\nFor since the fix\u2019d stars are many of them incomparably more\nremote than the Planets, \u2018tis not absurd to suppose that as the\nSun, who is the fix\u2019d star nearest to us, has a whole Systeme of\nPlanets that move about him, so some of the other fix\u2019d Stars\nmay be each of them the Centre, as it were, of another Systeme of\nCelestial Globes \u2026 . Now, in case there be other Mundane\nSystemes (if I may so speak) besides this visible one of ours, I think\nit may be probably suppos\u2019d that God may have given peculiar and\nadmirable instances of His inexhausted Wisedom in the Contrivance and\nGovernment of Systemes, that for aught we know may be fram\u2019d and\nmanag\u2019d in a manner quite differing, from what is observ\u2019d\nin that part of the Universe that is known to us. \u2026 [H]ere on\nEarth the Loadstone is a Mineral so differing in divers affections,\nnot onely from all other Stones, but from all other bodies, that are\nnot Magnetical, that this\n Heteroclite[44]\n Mineral scarce seems to be Originary of this World of ours, but to\nhave come into it, by a remove from some other World or Systeme\n\u2026.\n\nNow in these other Worlds, besides that we may suppose that\nthe Original Fabrick \u2026 into which the Omniscient Architect at\nfirst contriv\u2019d the parts of their matter, was very differing\nfrom the structure of our Systeme; besides this, I say, we\nmay conceive that there may be a vast difference betwixt the\nsubsequent Ph\u00e6nomena, and productions observable in one\nof those Systemes, from what regularly happens in\nours, though we should suppose no more, than that two or\nthree Laws of Local Motion may be differing in those unknown Worlds,\nfrom the Laws that obtain in ours (BW, 10:172\u20133, Birch 1772,\nV:138\u2013139).\n\n\nBoyle, that is, sees three distinct possibilities: the initial set up\nmay differ, the matter involved may differ, and the laws in question\nmay differ. Moreover the laws, as well as the matter, could have been\nformed differently by God, and could indeed vary from part to part of\nthe current universe within the universe. Clearly the case of\nvarying laws and the case of varying matter may run into each other,\nbut Boyle treats them as distinct possibilities, and gives as an\nexample the possibility of a combination of conservation and\nnon-conservation possibilities: we can envisage bodies with the\n\u201cpower of exciting Motion in another Body, without the Movents\nloosing its own.\u201d Were this to be the case the resulting\nphenomena would be \u201cstrangely diversifyed.\u201d Moreover, God\nmay have made a universe, or a part of this universe, which was such\nthat \u201csome parts of matter [would] be of themselves\nquiescent \u2026 and determin\u2019d to continue at rest\ntill some outward Agent force it into motion [while] other\nparts of the matter [may have] a Power \u2026 of restlessly moving\nthemselves, without loosing that power by the motion they excite in\nquiescent bodies. \u2026 Nor is it so extravagant a thing, as at\nfirst it may seem, to entertain such suspicions as these. For in the\ncommon Philosophy, besides that the Notion and Theory of Local Motion\nare but very imperfectly propos\u2019d, there are Laws or Rules of it\nnot well, not to say at all,\n establish\u2019d.\u201d[45]\n\nBoyle does not use the terminology of absolute space and time, but he\nremarks that God could have made the world earlier:\n\nNor was it his Indigence, that forc\u2019t him to make the World,\nthereby to make new Acquisitions, but his Goodnesse, that prest him to\nmanifest, and to impart his Glory; and the goods, which he so\nover-flowingly abounds with. Witness his Suspension of the\nWorld\u2019s Creation, which certainly had had an earlier Date, were\nthe Deity capable of Want, and the Creatures of Supplying it (BW,\n1:97, Birch 1772, I:270).\n\n\nBoyle\u2019s general view about both space and time is that since\nthey are\n\nPrimary & Heteroclite \u2026 \u2019tis noe wonder that our\nLimited & Imperfect understandings should not be able to reach to\na full & clear comprehension of them, but should be swallowd up\nwith the <Scruples &> Difficulties that may be suggested by\na <bold &> nice Inquiry into things, <to> which there\nseemes to belong a kind of Infinity (BP 2:53).\n\n\nHe also remarks about the world that\n\nif it be Finite [which Boyle allows as a possibility], then\n\u2019tis not in a place (such as the Schools define) after the\nmanner of other Bodys, since there is no ambient Body whose inward\nsurface determines it; and we may conceive it to move several wayes,\nas upwards or downwards, and yet not to change place, because (as was\njust now said,) it is in none, and all its Extream parts may keep the\nsame situation in reference to one another (BP\n 1:64).[46]\n\n\nMoreover, there is a\n\nrigid and Philosophical Notion \u2026 of rest, which for distinction\nsake may be called Absolute or Perfect Rest; which imports a\ncontinuance of a Body in the same place precisely, and\nincludes an absolute Negation of all local Motion, though never so\nslow or imperceptible; \u2026 in this rigid sense of the word Rest,\nI durst not affirm, that there are any Bodies at Rest in the Universe\n(at least for any long time) but willingly [allow] it to be made a\nProblem, whether there be any or no; \u2026 perhaps I [incline] to\nthe Negative part of the Question (BW, 6:194, Birch 1772,\n I:444).[47]\n\n\nAgain, Boyle writes: \u201cSuppose a Ball were in motion, & all\nthe world should be on a sudden annihilated about it; why may not the\nmotion of that Ball be continu\u2019d? there being nothing to stop\nit; & if it be continu\u2019d, we have a motion where the mobile\ndos not quitt the neighborhood of som bodys, and approach nearer to\nothers\u201d (BP 1:3).\n\nWe have, then, Boyle\u2019s view that a body can continue \u201cin\nthe same place precisely,\u201d that the whole (finite)\nuniverse might move in space, and that God could have created the\nworld earlier than he did. Such views do not at least amount to a\nrejection of absolute space and time. Boyle\u2019s\ncontemporary, Leibniz, who did reject absolute space, explicitly drew\nthe conclusion that a finite universe could not move as a\nwhole in space, and could not have been created earlier in\n time.[48]\n\nThe universe God created, then, contains a number of finite\nincorporeal entities, for whom the writ of physics does not\nrun, and a number of material entities, compounded as far as we are\naware, of the same matter in every case, set in a space and time\nindependent of them, and subject to a number of God given laws.\n",
