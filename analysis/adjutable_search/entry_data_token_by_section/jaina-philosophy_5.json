    "main_text": "A complete worldview: metaphysics, taxonomies, cosmology || An atomism\n2.2 An atomism\n\nThe whole physics of Jainism is an atomism. In this, Jaina conceptions\nare close to those of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition.\nAn atom (param\u0101\u1e47u) is infinitesimal, ultimate and\neternal. From this, it is neither created nor destroyed. Now,\ncontrarily to the conceptions of Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nphilosophers, according to which God (\u012a\u015bvara) is\nthe one who presides over the association of these atoms and creates\nthe world as we experience it, Jaina philosophers hold that there is\nno such entity. For them, atoms have always been there and their\nassociation follows natural laws. Jaina philosophers are especially\ncritical of an attitude that does not favor ethical responsibility,\nand the recognition that an external consciousness is responsible for\nthe state of the world risks to undermine this ethical responsibility\nbeyond repair. According to them, ethics especially requires that the\nindividual can make or unmake herself in this world. This is partly\nwhat explains that there is a lengthy tradition of refutations by both\nJaina and Buddhist philosophers of the Naiy\u0101yika arguments in\nfavor of the fact that God is the sustainer of the world.\n\nNext to this, an atom is not necessarily material. Indeed, selves are\na type of atom. Matter exists as atom or as aggregate\n(skandha). The aggregates, produced out of a mutual\nattraction of atoms, vary from binary to infinite compounds and every\nperceivable object, that is to say every object endowed with a form,\nis an aggregate. As such, atoms are the formless basis of all forms,\nalthough sometimes it is said that it has form inasmuch as it can be\nperceived by the omniscient ones. Furthermore, in contradistinction\nwith the conception of Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and in\nagreement with Leucippus and Democritus, Jaina philosophers hold that\nan atom of one type is first undifferentiated, similar to any other\natom of the same type, and then develops differentiated\ncharacteristics so as to become an atom of earth, an atom of water,\netc. Atoms therefore acquire a kind of taste, color, smell, contact,\nas well as weight, the heavier moving downwards and the lighter\nupwards. An interesting characteristic of Jainism is that an atom may\ndevelop a motion so swift that it traverses in one moment the whole\nuniverse. This explains that some saints, who are well advanced in the\npath that consists in realizing the proper nature of things, can\nperform this miracle.\n\nFinally, atoms can contract and expand. When in subtle state,\ninnumerable atoms occupy the space of one gross atom. Matter is an\neternal substance undetermined with regards to quantity and quality.\nIt is because the atoms in it can expand that matter may increase or\ndiminish in volume without addition or loss of particles. For a self,\nwhich also is an atom and which has dimensions although it is not\nmaterial, this means that it is capable of expansion and contraction.\nThe self is actually co-extensive with the physical body it occupies.\nThis is what explains that we have sensations from the top of the head\nto the tip of the toes. This means that the self is of a very small\nsize when it starts in the womb, then it expands and, at the end of\neach earthly life, it contracts again into the seed of the next birth.\nTo explain how this works, Jaina philosophers use metaphors such as\nthat of a lamp: whether placed in a small pot or in a larger room, a\nlamp illumines the whole space. In the same way, the self imparts\nconsciousness according to the dimensions of the body it occupies.\nAnother specificity of Jainism is the belief according to which, under\nspecial circumstances, an embodied self can expand beyond its body, up\nto the size of the universe, and act outside of it. This projection,\ncalled \u201csamudgh\u0101ta\u201d,\n\u201cextermination\u201d, enables her to annihilate specific karmic\nmatter (Pragya 2021).\n",
