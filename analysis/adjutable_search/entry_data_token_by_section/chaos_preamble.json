    "main_text": "\n\n The big news about chaos is supposed to be that the smallest of\nchanges in a system can result in very large differences in that\nsystem\u2019s behavior. The so-called butterfly effect has become one of\nthe most popular images of chaos. The idea is that the flapping of a\nbutterfly\u2019s wings in Argentina could cause a tornado in Texas three\nweeks later. By contrast, in an identical copy of the world sans the\nArgentinian butterfly, no such storm would have arisen in Texas. The\nmathematical version of this property is known as sensitive\ndependence. However, it turns out that sensitive dependence is\nsomewhat old news, so some of the implications flowing from it are\nperhaps not such \u201cbig news\u201d after all. Still, chaos\nstudies have highlighted these implications in fresh ways and led to\nthinking about other implications as well.\n\n\n In addition to exhibiting sensitive dependence, chaotic systems\npossess two other properties: they are deterministic and nonlinear\n(Smith 2007). This entry discusses systems exhibiting these three\nproperties and what their philosophical implications might be for\ntheories and theoretical understanding, confirmation, explanation,\nrealism, determinism, free will and consciousness, and human and\ndivine action.\n\n",
