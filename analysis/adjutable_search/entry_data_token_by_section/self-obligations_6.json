    "main_text": "Applications || Suicide\n6.1 Suicide\n\nThe topic of suicide \u2013 as studied by moral and political\nphilosophers \u2013 is complex and multifaceted. (See the entry on\n suicide.)\n People have many different things to live for, as well as\ntribulations to escape from. In dark moments it may well seem\nreasonable to wish for a release from suffering; other times, the\nattempt to end one\u2019s own life may strike others \u2013 and\noneself, if one survives \u2013 as rash and tragic. One extreme case\nwould be martyrs, praised for giving their lives to a higher cause. At\nthe other end might be those who, at least on some views, have a very\nclear duty to stay alive. Even in such cases, however, it may be inapt\nor counterproductive to castigate someone for actions taken out of\ndistraught desperation, abandoned by their sense of self-worth; to\ndefend a duty of self-care here is not simply to advocate blaming and\nshaming.\n\nThere are also many people to whom one might owe the duty not to kill\noneself, as Kant observes:\n\n[Suicide] can\u2026be regarded as a violation of one\u2019s duty to\nother people (the duty of spouses to each other, of parents to their\nchildren, of a subject to his superior or to his fellow citizens, and\nfinally even a violation of duty to God, as his abandoning the post\nassigned him in the world without having been called away from it).\n(MM 6:422)\n\n\nOur question, however, must be separated out from that of duties to\nothers, from blame, and from the rationality of choosing death. The\nquestion is whether we owe it to ourselves not to\nprematurely end our lives. To get a clear look, it helps to focus on\nthe effects of suicide on the individual, not their spouse and dog and\nso on; and it may be helpful to consider both the case where one has a\nbright future and the case of foreseen grimness.\n\nSince ancient Greece, philosophers have been skeptical of a duty to\noneself not to commit suicide, however bright one\u2019s future.\nAristotle (1138a 4\u20131138b 11) argues that suicide cannot in\nprinciple be an injustice against oneself \u2013 where\n\u201cinjustice\u201d roughly means a violation of rights \u2013\nbecause the suicidal person \u201csuffers voluntarily,\u201d and\n\u201cnobody suffers injustice voluntarily.\u201d This last claim,\nclearly, is too strong. People might freely choose to suffer injustice\nwhen prevention is costly, as when someone declines to invest in an\nelaborate home security system. Other times the alternative involves\neven graver injustice; voting for \u201cthe lesser of two\nevils\u201d is still voluntary even if one wishes for a better slate\nof candidates. Still, there is something to Aristotle\u2019s point.\nHe is foreshadowing the Paradox of Self-Release. If the suicidal\nperson willingly opts to die, how could their choice possibly\ninfringe their own duties? Wouldn\u2019t those duties count as fully\nwaived?\n\nThis line of thought directly leads to a libertarian view of suicide:\nyour life, your choice \u2013 at least, when it comes to what you owe\nyourself. (See, e.g., Szasz 2002.) This is the sort of view that\nSinger and other skeptics hold across the board.\n\nA well-known challenge to such laissez-faire views comes from David\nVelleman, who argues in a Kantian spirit that those who defend the\n\u201cright to die\u201d are missing something important: \u201cthe\nsense of a value in us that makes a claim on us \u2013 a value that\nwe must live up to\u201d (1999, 612). Velleman here is\nreferring to our value as persons, a value that should be cherished as\nan end in itself rather than exploited as a mere means to a good time.\nFrances Kamm (1997) would reply that, when people have good reasons\nfor choosing death \u2013 as when their life is consumed by\n\u201cunbearable pain\u201d \u2013 they should be free to\n\u201cdecline the honor of being a person.\u201d\n\nMore recently, Schofield (2021, 137\u201338) argues that Velleman\ndoes not go far enough in recognizing obligations to oneself.\nOne\u2019s own value is not something \u201cthat just happens to\nreside within a person,\u201d but instead, one stands in a\n\u201cspecial relationship\u201d to any affront to that value. To\nput it another way, Velleman defends a self-regarding\nobligation not to commit suicide, but no such obligation to\noneself. Hill similarly doesn\u2019t go so far as to call suicide a\nviolation of duty, much less of rights, though he thinks it may in\nsome cases express a lack of proper value for one\u2019s own humanity\n(Hill, Jr 1991b). (By contrast, Mu\u00f1oz (2020, 695) thinks we owe\nit to everyone not to pointlessly, tragically kill them \u2013 self\nincluded \u2013 and that this obligation is \u201ctoo\nimportant\u201d to waive for trivial reasons; for a similar claim see\nSchofield 2021, 68n7.)\n\nHow should we think about the possibility of an obligation to oneself\nnot to commit suicide? On Schofield\u2019s framework, the key\nquestion is that of what we can legitimately demand of ourselves from\ndifferent possible perspectives. From the perspective of yourself in\nthe future, when you will be feeling the brunt of your decisions in\nthe present, you may find yourself with good reasons for resenting\nyour past choices \u2013 frittered savings, thoughtless smoking, and\nso on. From that perspective you could legitimately demand of\nyourself, in your present perspective, that you take care better care\nof your future interests. If so, Schofield thinks, you owe that care\nto yourself.\n\nIt is not altogether obvious, however, how this is supposed to work\nwhen the harm involves death. If you end your life, your future\nperspective never exists. There will be no actual perspective from\nwhich you can imagine issuing a legitimate demand. (You can conjure up\nthe perspective in your imagination, but that is not the same thing.)\nFor this reason, it may be misleading to say, as C\u00edbik (2020,\n196) does, that \u201cthe victim\u201d of a suicide is one\u2019s\n\u201cfuture self.\u201d The future self is not adversely\naffected; they are never even effected. (For a\nhighly original and illuminating discussion, see Kanygina forthcoming,\n\u00a72.)\n\nSo much for the case of missing out on a valuable future. What if your\nfuture looks bleak, and there\u2019s no way to fix it \u2013 only to\navoid it? Schofield considers such cases in an open-minded way.\n\nImagine a person who knows she will soon lose control of her rational\ncapacities, her ability to reason, her ability to understand things as\nthey are, and so on. Imagine that this is because her capacities\ndegrade, or because her pain will be so overwhelming that reason is\nimpossible. In such a case, we might wonder whether the rational\nstandpoint demands at all that one refrain from self-termination. And\nif it does, one might wonder why one would not be able to waive the\ndemand. (2021, 138)\n\n\nHere Schofield\u2019s emphasis is on the individual\u2019s interests\nand standing, not the raw moral value of her rationality. The image is\nnot that of a guardian assigned to a post, but of a person with some\nauthority to make decisions about her own life.\n",
