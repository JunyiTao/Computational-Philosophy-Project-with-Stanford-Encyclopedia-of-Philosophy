    "main_text": "Jus in Bello || Walzer and his Critics\n4.1 Walzer and his Critics\n\nThe traditionalist jus in bello, as reflected in\ninternational law, holds that conduct in war must satisfy three\nprinciples:\n\nDiscrimination: Targeting noncombatants is\n impermissible.[14]\nProportionality: Collaterally harming noncombatants (that is,\nharming them foreseeably, but unintendedly) is permissible only if the\nharms are proportionate to the goals the attack is intended to\n achieve.[15]\nNecessity: Collaterally harming noncombatants is permissible only\nif, in the pursuit of one\u2019s military objectives, the least\nharmful means feasible are \n chosen.[16]\n\n\nThese principles divide the possible victims of war into two classes:\ncombatants and noncombatants. They place no constraints on killing\n combatants.[17]\n But\u2014outside of \u201csupreme emergencies\u201d, rare\ncircumstances in which intentionally killing noncombatants is\nnecessary to avert an unconscionable threat\u2014noncombatants may be\nkilled only unintendedly and, even then, only if the harm they suffer\nis necessary and proportionate to the intended goals of the\n attack.[18]\n Obviously, then, much hangs on what makes one a combatant. This entry adopts a\nconservative definition. Combatants are (most) members of the\norganized armed forces of a group that is at war, as well as others\nwho directly participate in hostilities or have a continuous combat\nfunction (for discussion, see Haque 2017). Noncombatants are\nnot combatants. There are, of course, many hard cases, especially in\nasymmetric wars, but they are not considered here. \u201cSoldier\u201d is \nused interchangeably with \u201ccombatant\u201d and\n\u201ccivilian\u201d interchangeably with\n\u201cnoncombatant\u201d.\n\nBoth traditionalist just war theory and international law explicitly\nlicense fighting in accordance with these constraints, regardless of\none\u2019s objectives. In other words, they endorse:\n\nCombatant Equality: Soldiers who satisfy Discrimination,\nProportionality, and Necessity fight permissibly, regardless of what\nthey are fighting for.\n [19]\n\nWe discuss Proportionality and Necessity below; for now let us\nconcentrate on Michael Walzer\u2019s influential argument for\nDiscrimination and Combatant Equality, which has proved very\ncontroversial.\n\nIndividual human beings enjoy fundamental rights to life and liberty,\nwhich prohibit others from harming them in certain ways. Since\nfighting wars obviously involves depriving others of life and liberty,\naccording to Walzer, it can be permissible only if each of the victims\nhas, \u201cthrough some act of his own \u2026 surrendered or lost\nhis rights\u201d (Walzer 2006: 135). He then claims that,\n\u201csimply by fighting\u201d, all combatants \u201chave lost\ntheir title to life and liberty\u201d (Walzer 2006: 136). First,\nmerely by posing a threat to me, a person alienates himself from me,\nand from our common humanity, and so himself becomes a legitimate\ntarget of lethal force (Walzer 2006: 142). Second, by participating in\nthe armed forces, a combatant has \u201callowed himself to be made\ninto a dangerous man\u201d (Walzer 2006: 145), and thus surrendered\nhis rights. By contrast, noncombatants are \u201cmen and women with\nrights, and\u2026 they cannot be used for some military purpose,\neven if it is a legitimate purpose\u201d (Walzer 2006: 137). This\nintroduces the concept of liability into the debate, which we need to\ndefine carefully. On most accounts, that a person is liable to be\nkilled means that she is not wronged by being killed. Often this is\nunderstood, as it was in Walzer, in terms of rights: everyone starts\nout with a right to life, but that right can be forfeited or lost,\nsuch that one can be killed without that right being violated or\ninfringed. Walzer and his critics all agreed that killing a person\nintentionally is permissible only if either she has lost the\nprotection of her right to life, or if the good achieved thereby is\nvery great indeed, enough that, though she is wronged, it is not all\nthings considered wrong to kill her. Her right is permissibly\ninfringed. Walzer and his critics believe that such cases are very\nrare in war, arising only when the alternative to intentionally\nviolating people\u2019s right to life is an imminent catastrophe on\nthe order of Nazi victory in Europe (this is an example of a supreme emergency).\n\nThese simple building blocks give us both Discrimination and Combatant\nEquality\u2014the former, because noncombatants, in virtue of\nretaining their rights, are not legitimate objects of attack; the\nlatter, because all combatants lose their rights, regardless of what\nthey are fighting for: hence, as long as they attack only enemy\ncombatants, they fight legitimately, because they do not violate\nanyone\u2019s rights.\n\nThese arguments have faced withering criticism. The simplest objection\nagainst Combatant Equality brings it into conflict with\nProportionality (McMahan 1994; Rodin 2002; Hurka 2005). Unintended\nnoncombatant deaths are permissible only if proportionate to the\nmilitary objective sought. This means the objective is worth that much\ninnocent suffering. But military objectives are merely means to an\nend. Their worth depends on how valuable the end is. How many innocent\ndeaths would be proportionate to Al Shabab\u2019s successfully\ngaining control of Mogadishu now or to Iraq\u2019s capturing Kuwaiti\nterritory and oil reserves in 1991? In each case the answer is\nobvious: none.\n\nProportionality is about weighing the evil inflicted against the evil\naverted (Lee 2012). But the military success of unjust combatants does\nnot avert evil, it is itself evil. Evil intentionally inflicted can\nonly add to, not counterbalance, unintended evils. Combatant Equality\ncannot be true.\n\nOther arguments against Combatant Equality focus on Walzer\u2019s\naccount of how one loses the right to life. They typically start by\naccepting his premise that permissible killing in war does not violate\nthe rights of the victims against being killed, at least for\nintentional\n killing.[20]\n This contrasts with the view that sometimes people\u2019s rights to\nlife can be overridden, so war can be permissible despite infringing\npeople\u2019s rights. Walzer\u2019s critics then show that his\naccount of how we lose our right to life is simply not plausible.\nMerely posing a threat to others\u2014even a lethal threat\u2014is\nnot sufficient to warrant the loss of one\u2019s fundamental rights,\nbecause sometimes one threatens others\u2019 lives for very good\nreasons (McMahan 1994). The soldiers of the Kurdish Peshmerga,\nheroically fighting to rescue Yazidis from ISIL\u2019s genocidal\nattacks, do not thereby lose their rights not to be killed by their\nadversaries. Posing threats to others in the pursuit of a just aim,\nwhere those others are actively trying to thwart that just aim, cannot\nvoid or vitiate one\u2019s fundamental natural rights against being\nharmed by those very people. The consent-based argument is equally\nimplausible as a general defence for Combatant Equality. Unjust\ncombatants have something to gain from waiving their rights against\nlethal attack, if doing so causes just combatants to effect the same\nwaiver. And on most views, many unjust combatants have nothing to\nlose, since by participating in an unjust war they have at least\nweakened if not lost those rights already. Just combatants, by\ncontrast, have something to lose, and nothing to gain. So why would\ncombatants fighting for a just cause consent to be harmed by their\nadversaries, in the pursuit of an unjust end?\n\nWalzer\u2019s case for Combatant Equality rests on showing that just\ncombatants lose their rights to life. His critics have shown that his\narguments to this end fail. So Combatant Equality is false. But they\nhave shown more than this. Inspired by Walzer to look at the\nconditions under which we lose our rights to life, his critics have\nmade theoretical advances that place other central tenets of jus\nin bello in jeopardy. They argued, contra Walzer, that\nposing a threat is not sufficient for liability to be killed (McMahan\n1994, 2009). But they also showed that posing the threat oneself is\nnot necessary for liability either. This is more controversial, but\nrevisionists have long argued that liability is grounded, in war as\nelsewhere, in one\u2019s responsibility for contributing to a\nwrongful threat. The US president, for example, is responsible for a\ndrone strike she orders, even though she does not fire the\nweapon herself.\n\nAs many have noted, this argument undermines Discrimination (McMahan\n1994; Arneson 2006; Fabre 2012; Frowe 2014). In many states,\nnoncombatants play an important role in the resort to military force.\nIn modern industrialized countries, as much as 25 per cent of the\npopulation works in war-related industries (Downes 2006: 157\u20138;\nsee also Gross 2010: 159; Valentino et al. 2010: 351); we provide the\nbelligerents with crucial financial and other services; we support and\nsustain the soldiers who do the fighting; we pay our taxes and in\ndemocracies we vote. Our contributions to the state\u2019s capacity\nover time give it the strength and support to concentrate on\n war.[21]\n If the state\u2019s war is unjust, then many noncombatants are\nresponsible for contributing to wrongful threats. If that is enough\nfor them to lose their rights to life, then they are permissible\ntargets.\n\nMcMahan (2011a) has sought to avert this troubling implication of his\narguments by contending that almost all noncombatants on the unjust\nside (unjust noncombatants) are less responsible than all unjust\ncombatants. But this involves applying a double standard, talking up\nthe responsibility of combatants, while talking down that of\nnoncombatants, and mistakes a central element in his account of\nliability to be killed. On his view, a person is liable to be killed\nin self- or other-defence in virtue of being, of those able to bear an\nunavoidable and indivisible harm, the one who is most responsible for\nthis situation coming about (McMahan 2002, 2005b). Even if\nnoncombatants are only minimally responsible for their\nstates\u2019 unjust wars\u2014that is, they are not blameworthy,\nthey merely voluntarily acted in a way that foreseeably contributed to\nthis result\u2014on McMahan\u2019s view this is enough to make them\nliable to be killed, if doing so is necessary to save the lives of\nwholly innocent combatants and noncombatants on the just side (see\nespecially McMahan 2009: 225).\n\nOne response is to reject this comparative account of how\nresponsibility determines liability, and argue for a non-comparative\napproach, according to which one\u2019s degree of responsibility must\nbe great enough to warrant such a severe derogation from one\u2019s\nfundamental rights. But if we do this, we must surely concede that\nmany combatants on the unjust side are not sufficiently responsible\nfor unjustified threats to be liable to be killed. Whether through\nfear, disgust, principle or ineptitude, many combatants are wholly\nineffective in war, and contribute little or nothing to threats posed\nby their side. The much-cited research of S. L. A. Marshall claimed\nthat only 15\u201325 per cent of Allied soldiers in the Second World\nWar who could have fired their weapons did so (Marshall 1978). Most\nsoldiers have a natural aversion to killing, which even intensive\npsychological training may not overcome (Grossman 1995). Many\ncontribute no more to unjustified threats than do noncombatants. They\nalso lack the \u201cmens rea\u201d that might make\nliability appropriate in the absence of a significant causal\ncontribution. They are not often blameworthy. The loss of their right\nto life is not a fitting response to their conduct.\n\nIf Walzer is right that in war, outside of supreme emergencies, we may\nintentionally kill only people who are liable to be killed, and if a\nsignificant proportion of unjust combatants and noncombatants are\nresponsible to the same degree as one another for unjustified threats,\nand if liability is determined by responsibility, then we must decide\nbetween two unpalatable alternatives. If we set a high threshold of\nresponsibility for liability, to ensure that noncombatants are not\nliable to be killed, then we will also exempt many combatants from\nliability. In ordinary wars, which do not involve supreme emergencies,\nintentionally killing such non-liable combatants would be\nimpermissible. This moves us towards a kind of pacifism\u2014though\nwarfare can in principle be justified, it is so hard to fight without\nintentionally killing the non-liable that in practice we must be\npacifists (May 2015). But if we set the threshold of responsibility\nlow, ensuring that all unjust combatants are liable, then many\nnoncombatants will be liable too, thus rendering them permissible\ntargets and seriously undermining Discrimination. We are torn between\npacifism on the one hand, and realism on the other. This is the\n\u201cresponsibility dilemma\u201d for just war theory (Lazar\n2010).\n",
