    "main_text": "The Nature of Logic\n3. The Nature of Logic\n\n\nZabarella\u2019s introductory treatise on the nature of logic, De\nnatura logicae, is basic to his teaching in logic. He defines\nlogic as being neither a science nor an art, but, in keeping with the\ntraditional meaning of the word organon, just an instrument\n(instrumentum) of the arts and sciences. As an instrumental\ndiscipline it furnishes a useful tool of inquiry for all the arts and\nsciences. Logic does not have a real subject of its own, but deals\nwith concepts, which stand for real beings. In this it is comparable\nto grammar. The difference between grammar and logic is that the\nformer is concerned with the perfect verbal expression of concepts,\nand hence is a linguistic discipline, while the latter invents second\nnotions (notiones secundae) or second intentions, that are\nable to create order among concepts. Therefore logic serves to\nrecognize the truth and distinguish it from falsehood in every\ninstance. Logic is thus a rational discipline (disciplina\nrationalis) that is not itself philosophy, but springs from\nphilosophy and is devoted to philosophical ends (Vasoli 2011).\n\n\nZabarella followed Averroes in dividing logic into two parts:\nuniversal logic, which is common to all subjects; and particular\nlogic, which is specific to particular subjects. The first three books\nof Aristotle\u2019s Organon, the Categories, On Interpretation and\nthe Prior Analytics constitute the universal part of logic.\nAristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics, Topics and Sophistical\nRefutations are said to deal with particular logic as much as\nthey deal respectively with the demonstrative syllogism, the\ndialectical syllogism and the sophistical syllogism.  Following the\nNeoplatonic commentators (above all Simplicius), Zabarella also\nincluded Aristotle\u2019s Rhetoric and Poetics within\nlogic. The former is included because it teaches the use of the\nrhetorical syllogism or enthymeme, and rhetorical induction or\nexample; the latter because it also teaches the use of example, not to\npersuasive ends, but for imitation.\n\n\nSince logic, viewed as the universal instrument for distinguishing\nbetween the true and the false, differs according to the objects to\nwhich it is applied and the ends for which it is used, its nature\ndepends on the realm of possible objects and ends. Rhetoric and\npoetics are special cases because they deal not with knowledge but\nwith the political disciplines in so far as they are concerned with\nthe good of the people. Sophistical syllogistic is another special\ncase, because it is directed towards deception and prefers to use\nfalsehood as its material. Dialectic and demonstration, however, are\ndirected towards the expression of truth. Dialectic is aimed at the\nproduction of opinion, and deals with probable and contingent\nmaterial; demonstration is dedicated to the acquisition of truth, and\nso it is exclusively occupied with necessary, true objects (Kessler\n1998, p. 837).\n",
