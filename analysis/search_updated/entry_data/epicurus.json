    "preamble": "\n\nThe philosophy of Epicurus (341\u2013270 B.C.E.) was a complete and\ninterdependent system, involving a view of the goal of human life\n(happiness, resulting from absence of physical pain and mental\ndisturbance), an empiricist theory of knowledge (sensations, together\nwith the perception of pleasure and pain, are infallible criteria), a\ndescription of nature based on atomistic materialism, and a\nnaturalistic account of evolution, from the formation of the world to\nthe emergence of human societies. Epicurus believed that, on the basis\nof a radical materialism which dispensed with transcendent entities\nsuch as the Platonic Ideas or Forms, he could disprove the possibility\nof the soul\u2019s survival after death, and hence the prospect of\npunishment in the afterlife. He regarded the unacknowledged fear of\ndeath and punishment as the primary cause of anxiety among human\nbeings, and anxiety in turn as the source of extreme and irrational\ndesires. The elimination of the fears and corresponding desires would\nleave people free to pursue the pleasures, both physical and mental,\nto which they are naturally drawn, and to enjoy the peace of mind that\nis consequent upon their regularly expected and achieved satisfaction.\nIt remained to explain how irrational fears arose in the first place:\nhence the importance of an account of social evolution. Epicurus was\naware that deeply ingrained habits of thought are not easily\ncorrected, and thus he proposed various exercises to assist the\nnovice. His system included advice on the proper attitude toward\npolitics (avoid it where possible) and the gods (do not imagine that\nthey concern themselves about human beings and their behavior), the\nrole of sex (dubious), marriage (also dubious) and friendship\n(essential), reflections on the nature of various meteorological and\nplanetary phenomena, about which it was best to keep an open mind in\nthe absence of decisive verification, and explanations of such\nprocesses as gravity (that is, the tendency of objects to fall to the\nsurface of the earth) and magnetism, which posed considerable\nchallenges to the ingenuity of the earlier atomists. Although the\noverall structure of Epicureanism was designed to hang together and to\nserve its principal ethical goals, there was room for a great deal of\nintriguing philosophical argument concerning every aspect of the\nsystem, from the speed of atoms in a void to the origin of optical\nillusions.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Sources\n\nThe major source for Epicurean doctrine is Diogenes Laertius\u2019\nthird-century C.E. Lives of Eminent Philosophers, a\ncompilation of information on the lives and doctrines of the\nphilosophers of classical Greece (see \u201cDoxography of Ancient\nPhilosophy\u201d). In the tenth and final book, devoted to\nEpicureanism, Diogenes preserves three of Epicurus\u2019 letters to\nhis disciples, in which he presents his basic views in a concise and\nhandy form. The Letter to Herodotus summarizes\nEpicurus\u2019 physical theory, the Letter to Menoeceus\noffers a pr\u00e9cis of Epicurean ethics, and the Letter to\nPythocles treats astronomical and meteorological matters. (There\nis some doubt about whether the last is by Epicurus himself or a\nfollower, but there seems to be sufficient reason to attribute it to\nthe founder himself.) Diogenes also quotes a collection of brief\nsayings, called the \u201cPrincipal Beliefs\u201d or\n\u201cPrincipal Doctrines\u201d (Kuriai Doxai), excerpted\nfrom the writings of Epicurus or, in some cases, of his close\nassociates; another such collection, partially overlapping with the\nfirst, survives in an independent manuscript and is conventionally\ncalled the Vatican Sayings. The purpose of both sets, like that of the\nLetters, was to make the core doctrines easy to remember. Diogenes\nalso fills in topics not covered in the Letters, and provides a list\nof Epicurus\u2019 writings and other biographical information (for\nthe text, see Dorandi 2013; for an English translation, Mensch 2018).\n\n\nShort citations of Epicurus\u2019 works appear in other writers\n(e.g., Plutarch, Sextus Empiricus, and the Greek commentators on\nAristotle), often taken out of context or presented in a polemical and\ndistorted fashion. (The standard edition of Epicurus\u2019 works in\nGreek is Arrighetti 1973; the fullest collection of fragments and\ntestimonies is still Usener 1887, repr. with Italian translation,\nRamelli 2002; for translations, see Bibliography: Editions,\nTranslations, Commentaries). In addition, several works of Epicurus,\nincluding parts of his major treatise, On Nature (Peri\nphuse\u00f4s) \u2014 a series of lectures running to 37 papyrus\nrolls \u2014 have been recovered in damaged condition from the\nlibrary of a villa in the town of Herculaneum, which was buried in the\neruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 C.E. The library almost certainly\ncontained the working collection of Philodemus, an Epicurean\nphilosopher from Syria who studied in Athens and moved to Italy in the\nfirst century B.C.E. Many of the rolls consist of Philodemus\u2019\nown writings, and provide valuable information about later issues in\nthe history of Epicureanism. One must be cautious about ascribing\nthese views to the founder himself, although the school tended to be\nconservative and later thinkers embellished rather than altered\nEpicurus\u2019 own teachings. New editions and translations are now\nmaking these difficult texts available to a wider readership.\n\nMore or less contemporary with Philodemus is Lucretius (first century\nB.C.E.), who composed in Latin De rerum natura (\u201cOn the\nNature of Things\u201d; the title, if it is Lucretius\u2019 own, is\nan adaptation of \u201cOn Nature\u201d) in six books of hexameter\nverse, the meter characteristic of epic and didactic poetry. As a\ndedicated Epicurean, passionate to promulgate the message of the\nfounder, Lucretius reproduced Epicurean doctrine faithfully (Sedley\n1998; Clay 1983 allows Lucretius more originality). His poem\nconcentrates principally on the physical and psychological or\nepistemological aspects of Epicureanism, and to a great extent omits\nthe ethical. From a hostile point of view, Cicero rehearsed and\ncriticized Epicurus\u2019 ideas, especially concerning ethics, in\nseveral of his philosophical works, including On Moral Ends\n(De finibus) and the Tusculan Disputations. Still\nlater, in the second century C.E., another Diogenes erected a large\ninscription, to this day only partially excavated, in the city of\nOenoanda (in southwestern Turkey), which contained the basic tenets of\nEpicureanism (authoritative edition by Smith 1993, but new fragments\nhave been published subsequently; see also Gordon 1996, Hammerstaedt\net alii, 2017).\n2. Life\n\n\u201cEpicurus, the son of Neocles and Chaerestrata, was an Athenian\nfrom the deme of Gargettus and the lineage of the Phila\u00efdes, as\nMetrodorus says in his On Noble Families. Heraclides, among\nothers, in his epitome of Sotion, says that he was raised in Samos,\nsince the Athenians were given parcels of land there, but came to\nAthens when he was eighteen, when Xenocrates was head of the Academy\nand Aristotle was still in Chalcis\u201d (where he died in 322). So\nbegins the account by Diogenes Laertius (10.1). The dates for\nEpicurus\u2019 birth and first move to Athens are thus 341 B.C.E. and\n323 respectively. Diogenes adds that after the death of Alexander\n(323), when the Athenians were expelled from Samos, Epicurus left\nAthens and joined his father in Colophon (in 321), on the coast of\nwhat is now Turkey. Here he studied philosophy under the tutelage of\nNausiphanes, a Democritean philosopher with skeptical leanings, and\nauthor of a work called the Tripod, on which Epicurus\nreportedly drew for his Canon, his principal work on\nepistemology; in ethics, Nausiphanes substituted the term\nakatapl\u00eaxia (\u201cundauntability\u201d) for\nDemocritus\u2019 athambi\u00ea, \u201cfearlessness,\u201d\nas crucial to the good life, which invites comparison with\nEpicurus\u2019 ataraxia or \u201cimperturbability,\u201d\nthough Epicurus is said to have denied having been influenced by him\n(On Nausiphanes\u2019 role in transmitting elements of Democritean\ndoctrine to Epicurus, see Warren 2002: 160\u201392.)\n\nTen years later, Epicurus moved to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos,\nand soon proceeded to Lampsacus on the nearby mainland; in both cities\nhe taught and gathered followers before returning again to Athens in\n307/06, where he remained until his death in 270, at the age of\nseventy or seventy-one. In Athens, he purchased the property that\nbecame known as the \u201cGarden\u201d (later used as a name for his\nschool itself) and began to develop his own school in earnest.\nDiogenes reports a number of slanderous stories that were circulated\nby Epicurus\u2019 opponents, despite which he affirms that Epicurus\nwas of an extraordinarily humane disposition; this was the prevailing\nview, shared even by hostile witnesses to Epicureanism. Diogenes also\nrecords Epicurus\u2019 will (10.16\u201321), in which, among other\nthings, he made provisions for the children of his friends and\nappointed a successor.\n3. Physical Theory\n\nEpicurus held that the elementary constituents of nature are\nundifferentiated matter, in the form of discrete, solid and\nindivisible particles (\u201catoms\u201d) below the threshold of\nperception, plus empty space, that is, the complement of matter or\nwhere matter is not (Inwood 1981, Konstan 2014; contra Sedley 1982,\nwho argues that space, for Epicurus, is a continuous matrix extending\nuniformly throughout the universe, and is either occupied by matter or\nempty). In its broad outline, Epicurus inherited this scheme from the\nearlier atomists, above all Democritus. But Democritus\u2019 version\nhad been the object of critiques by later thinkers, especially\nAristotle, in part for incoherencies in the notion of an infinite\nvoid, in part for problems attaching to his idea of minima, or\nentities of the smallest conceivable size (see especially\nPhysics Book 6). First, freestanding entities of minimal size\ncould have no edges, and so no shapes, or rather would be all edge:\nthus, if two minima touched, they would wholly overlap. (The same\nargument applies to points in a line, which is why a line contains\npoints but is not composed of them, according to Aristotle.) Further,\nif atoms really are conceptually indivisible, and not just physically\nunsplittable, then when two atoms pass by each other it is impossible\nthat they should at any time be only partway past, for this would\nimply a point partway along the length of the atom, which contradicts\nthe premise that it is a minimum. Although Aristotle does not state\nthe argument precisely in this form, it is apparent that a strict\nconception of minimal-sized atoms entails that motion too must consist\nof discontinuous quanta; and if motion, then time. Atoms must, then,\nAristotle inferred, move in discrete hops (kin\u00eamata),\neach one occupying a single temporal minimum \u2014 and hence, all\natoms must move at a uniform speed. An infinite void, with atoms\ndistributed throughout it, led to problems of its own, for it permits\nno intrinsic spatial orientation and hence no account of why things\nfall, as they are observed to do.\n\nThe problem for Epicurus was to find a way of explaining the natural\nphenomena of bodily movement while responding to the challenges posed\nby Aristotle\u2019s criticisms of Democritus\u2019 theory. Epicurus\nrose to the challenge, although one cannot be certain that he was\nresponding directly to Aristotle\u2019s critique. (It is unclear\nwhether or how much philosophers of Epicurus\u2019 generation who\nwere not members of Aristotle\u2019s own school had access to\nAristotle\u2019s treatises.)\n\nFirst, he distinguished between the atom, which by its nature cannot\nbe broken apart, and the minimum conceivable expanse of matter: atoms\nhave such minima as parts, but are not minima themselves \u2014 there\ncan be no free-standing entity one minimum expanse in size. This\nresolves the problem of atomic edges, and also that of how atoms can\ncome in different shapes and sizes (though never large enough to be\nseen): to have the hooks and crevices needed to form compounds, they\ncan scarcely be theoretically partless. Second, Epicurus agreed that\ntime too is discontinuous, as is motion: Simplicius (p.\n934.23\u201330 Diels; translation in Konstan 1989) quotes him as\naffirming that it is untrue to say that an atom is moving over a\nminimum interval, but only that it has moved (some scholars maintain\nthat this is a later innovation in the school; see especially Verde\n2013). What is more, as Aristotle had argued must be the case, atoms\nall move at the same velocity (the principle of isotakheia).\nThis last claim entailed difficulties of its own, such as how atoms\never overtake each other, if they are moving in the same direction.\n(Lucretius invoked the idea of a random swerve to solve this one; see\nbelow.) But it also provided a solution to another problem, that of\nentropy: for since atoms can never slow down, the universe can never\ncome to a halt (in modern terms, there is no loss of energy). As for\ngravity, Epicurus may have had a solution to this too, and in a novel\nform. If an atom just on its own cannot slow down or alter its\ndirection of motion, then an atom that is rising or moving in an\noblique direction cannot at some point begin to tilt or fall, unless\nsomething blocks its progress and forces it to do so. If, however,\nafter a collision atoms tended to emerge in a statistically favored\ndirection \u2014 that is, if the motions of all atoms after\ncollisions did not cancel each other out but on average produced a\nvector, however small, in a given direction, then that direction would\nby definition be down. The absence of a global orientation in the\nuniverse was thus immaterial. Due to this vector, any given world\nwill, like our own, be similarly oriented in respect to the direction\n\u201cdown.\u201d (Given the infinite expanse of the universe on\nEpicurean theory \u2014 see below \u2014 we must expect there to be\na plurality of worlds, some like ours, some \u2014 within limits\n\u2014 different.)\n\nMacroscopic objects, of course, do not move at a uniform and very\ngreat speed; the atoms within them do, but their motions are\nrestricted and deflected by neighboring atoms, and so they vibrate. In\nthe case of compound objects that are completely at rest, the\nresultant of internal atomic motions is zero, relative, at least, to\nthe earth, which may have an average motion of its own. If so, and if\nfor some reason the earth\u2019s motion is slower in a downward\ndirection than that of objects on or near its surface \u2014 because,\nsay, the earth is disk-shaped, as Epicurus held, and hence sinks more\nslowly in the surrounding atomic medium, like a falling leaf \u2014\nthen Epicurus could explain as well why things like stones tend to\nfall to the earth\u2019s surface when let go.\n\nEpicurus operated with a highly limited number of elementary\nprinciples in nature \u2014 he did not know the concept of force, for\nexample, or the associated ideas of attraction and repulsion among\natoms, not to mention more arcane properties \u2014 and for all his\nefforts to account for all the physical features of the world on the\nbasis of this theory, paradoxes remained. An excellent one is posed by\nSextus Empiricus (Against the Physicists = M\n10.144\u201348), which at the same time gives an idea of how\nEpicurean atoms were understood to behave (at least in Sextus\u2019\ntime, late 2nd century C.E.). Sextus imagined two atoms\nseparated by a distance of nine minima, traveling at the same speed\n(as atoms must) toward each other; after four temporal minima, the\natoms would be one spatial minimum apart. Then what? They cannot meet\nin the middle of the remaining distance, by the very concept of a\nminimum. Nor can one cross the interval before the other, without\nviolating the rule of equal velocity. But how, then, can they meet at\nall? We do not know an Epicurean reply to this conundrum. Perhaps\natoms are always an even number of minimal spaces apart from one\nanother. Or else, minima are always bundled in such large quantities\nthat it is meaningless to speak of an odd or even number of minima\nbetween atoms; the Stoics, at all events, held that whether the number\nof stars, for example, is odd or even is absolutely or naturally\nnon-evident (kathapax adela, Sextus Empiricus Outline of\nPyrrhonism = PH 2.97, M 8.147; physei\nadela, M 8.317\u201318). But Epicurus believed that\nmotion at the atomic level obeyed different laws from those that\nappear to operate at the level of macroscopic objects (that atomic\nmotion is discontinuous is an example). Perhaps, then, motions over\nsmall numbers of minima were in some sense indiscernible. Finally, it\nis possible that he discounted such a puzzle as a purely mathematical\nparadox, since it is recorded that he had little interest in\nmathematics as a separate science from physics and believed it to be\nirrelevant to the proper study of physics.\n\nFascinating as these questions are in their own right, Epicurus\nhimself does not proceed by creating an abstract model, exploring its\ninternal coherence, and determining its applicability to phenomena, in\nthe ideal manner of modern science. Rather, he begins with the\ntestimony of the senses, which he thinks are always reliable. These\nprovide a basis on which to draw conclusions either with respect to\nthings that still await confirmation or those that are by nature\nimperceptible (Letter to Herodotus = LH 38). Thus,\nin beginning his account of the physical world in this Letter, he\nargues that things cannot arise out of nothing, since otherwise there\nwould be no need of specific seeds for specific plants and animals,\nand anything whatsoever could be generated out of just any types of\nmaterial elements. Since this is not seen to happen, but reproduction\nin things we can observe with our senses is in fact orderly and\ndeterminate, spontaneous generation at any level is ruled out. The\nlogic is what Epicurus calls counterwitnessing: a hypothetical premise\n(here, that things sometimes arise out of nothing) is eliminated\nbecause experience tells against its conclusion (here, that the coming\ninto being of visible objects does not require determinate seeds or\nmaterials). More simply, if A then B; but not\nB, hence not A. One might, of course, challenge the\nimplication: something might arise from nothing, even if there are no\ncases of chickens giving birth to horses. The important point,\nhowever, is that Epicurus invokes the data of perception to testify\nfor or against the nature of elementary phenomena; he assumes a\ncertain uniformity of nature at all levels. So too with his next\npostulate: things are not destroyed into what is not, since in that\ncase everything would cease to exist (and would have ceased to exist\nbefore now, given infinite past time \u2014 recall that nothing is\ncreated out of nothing); but things do exist, hence the premise is\nfalse.\n\nAs for bodies (note the plural: Epicurus does not typically speak of\nmatter per se) and void as the basic physical principles, the senses,\nEpicurus affirms, testify to the existence of bodies, and by\ncalculation on the basis of the senses we infer the nature of what is\ninvisible, for example the atoms (LH 39). Here the reasoning\nis based on analogy: what is evident to our senses must be true on the\nmicroscopic level as well, at least in some respects. Void must exist,\nin turn, if bodies are to be able to move, as they are seen to do.\nThus motion is the counterwitness to the non-existence of void \u2014\nan indirect argument is required since one cannot perceive empty\nspace. What is more, since bodies, being \u201cfull,\u201d offer\nresistance and void, being empty, offers no resistance, they\ncomplement each other and exhaust the possibilities; hence it is\nimpossible to conceive of anything besides these two principles, apart\nfrom things that are accidents of them \u2014 accidents that arise\nfrom unions of elementary bodies in the void. (Inconceivability is\nanother tool in Epicurus\u2019 method of demonstration.) These\nelementary bodies, then, are the atoms, which are indivisible and\ninalterable, if things are not to dissolve into nothingness. The\nLetter to Herodotus is an epitome of Epicurean doctrine, and\nthe arguments are crisp and abbreviated, but the reasoning is clear,\nand is confirmed by the more detailed treatment in Lucretius, which\nalmost certainly follows Epicurus\u2019 On Nature (see Leone\n2012). Epicurus appeals to some elementary intuitions concerning\nbodies and their movement through space in order to establish the\nstructure of imperceptibly small things; he concludes that these must\nbe inalterable if nature is not to dissolve into nothing (creation\nback out of nothing having already been eliminated by the argument\ncited above from regularity in generation); and the basic features of\nthe atomic system are then in place. A similar appeal to the senses\nestablishes the infinity of the universe, since what is finite must\nhave an edge, and an edge is conceived in reference to something\nbeyond it. But the universe \u2014 in Greek, the \u201call\u201d\n\u2014 contains everything, and so there is nothing outside it by\nwhich to conceive an edge. Hence, it is infinite. And if the all is\ninfinite, so is the void and the number of atoms as well, for\notherwise atoms would be too widely dispersed ever to meet\n(LH 41\u201342).\n\nEpicurus now has in place the fundamental constituents of his natural\nworld, and he might have stopped here, with atoms and void and the\ndenial, on the grounds of inconceivability, of any other kind of basic\nphysical principle. All secondary properties, such as color and taste,\nwill be explained as epiphenomena of atomic combinations, and\nperception of things at a distance by the continual emission of\ninfinitesimally thin laminas from objects, which maintain the relevant\nfeatures of the source (in the case of vision, for example, the\nlaminas will preserve the atomic patterns specific to the color and\nshape of the object) and directly stimulate the relevant sense organ.\nThis is a tricky thesis, and again posed puzzles: how do the lamina or\nsimulacra, as Lucretius called them, of a mountain enter the eye, for\nexample? In fragments? By somehow shrinking? We do not know the answer\nto this one, but there are some plausible hypotheses (see Leone 2012;\nKonstan 2020). A few more concepts fill in the picture of the natural\nworld: thus, Epicurus denies that there can be infinitely many kinds\nof atoms, for then all shapes (which define the kinds) at any given\nmagnitude would be exhausted and atoms would have to reach visible\nproportions, which we know that they do not (this argument depends on\nthe idea of minima, discussed further below); instead, the number of\nkinds (i.e., shapes of various microscopic sizes) is inconceivably\nlarge but \u201cnot strictly infinite,\u201d whereas the number of\neach kind of atom is simply infinite (LH 55\u201356). This\ncondition is also invoked to explain why there is a limit on possible\ntypes of combinations of atoms, and hence on the number of viable\nspecies of things in the perceptible world: if there were infinitely\nmany kinds of atoms, Epicurus believed, they could combine to generate\nabsolutely anything \u2014 an infinity of different sorts of\nthing.\n\nBut an infinite number of solid and therefore indivisible atoms of\nfinitely many kinds, such as Epicurus\u2019 theory provides, are\nenough to avoid the possibility of the universe crumbling into\nnothing. Why did Epicurus complicate matters still further with the\ndoctrine that atoms themselves consist of still smaller parts in the\nform of mathematically minimal expanses, as we saw above that he does?\nFinite bodies, according to Epicurus, had to be composed of smaller\nexpanses, and if there were no lower limit in size to such expanses,\none would have to imagine traversing such a body in an infinite number\nof moves \u2014 but then, however small these infinitesimals might\nbe, the object that contained them, Epicurus reasoned, would have to\nbe infinitely large (LH 56\u201357). What are such minima\nlike? Epicurus asks us to think of the smallest perceptible thing. It\ndiffers from larger visible entities in that it has no sub-parts to be\ntraversed with the eye: if you do attempt to visualize such sub-parts,\nthey simply coincide with the original perceptible minimum. Since such\nminimal visible entities have no parts, they do not touch edge to edge\n(edges are parts), and yet they measure out the body that contains\nthem, larger bodies having more such minima. By analogy with the\nvisible, then, we conceive of the smallest part of an atom\n(LH 58\u201359). This conception resembles the way points\nexist in a line, according to Aristotle, since they too do not touch,\nnor can they exist independently. But Epicurean minima differ from\npoints in that they are physical expanses and so have extension. This\nlooks like a contradictory state of affairs: can we imagine, for\nexample, an atom consisting of just two minima? Or ten? It would be\nlike counting up the least visible bits of a perceptible object.\nGeometrical problems arise as well, since it was known that the side\nand diagonal of a cube, for example, were incommensurable, yet both\nmust, it would appear, be composed of finite and hence commensurable\nnumbers of minima. On the assumption that Epicurus was aware of and\ncared about such puzzles, it has been suggested that he thought any\natom consists of a not strictly infinite, but inconceivably large\n\u2014 and so \u201cnot strictly finite\u201d \u2014 number of\nminima (see Konstan 1989a): thus, the minimum may be imagined as the\ninverse of the number of kinds of atoms postulated by Epicurus, a\nquantity that takes on a quasi-technical status as a special order of\nmagnitude. But sufficient evidence for this hypothesis is lacking.\n4. Psychology and Ethics\n\nHaving established the physical basis of the world, Epicurus proceeds\nto explain the nature of the soul (this, at least, is the order in\nwhich Lucretius sets things out). This too, of course, consists of\natoms: first, there is nothing that is not made up of atoms and void\n(secondary qualities are simply accidents of the arrangement of\natoms), and second, an incorporeal entity could neither act on nor be\nmoved by bodies, as the soul is seen to do (e.g., it is conscious of\nwhat happens to the body, and it initiates physical movement).\nEpicurus maintains that soul atoms are particularly fine and are\ndistributed throughout the body (LH 64), and it is by means\nof them that we have sensations (aisth\u00easeis) and the\nexperience of pain and pleasure, which Epicurus calls\npath\u00ea (a term used by Aristotle and others to signify\nemotions instead). Body without soul atoms is unconscious and inert,\nand when the atoms of the body are disarranged so that it can no\nlonger support conscious life, the soul atoms are scattered and no\nlonger retain the capacity for sensation (LH 65). There is\nalso a part of the human soul that is concentrated in the chest, and\nis the seat of the higher intellectual functions. The distinction is\nimportant, because it is in the rational part that error of judgment\nenters in. Sensation, like pain and pleasure, is incorrigible just\nbecause it is a function of the non-rational part, which does not\nmodify a perception \u2014 that is, the reception of lamina emitted\nfrom macroscopic bodies \u2014 by the addition of opinion or\nbelief.\n\nThe corporeal nature of the soul has two crucial consequences for\nEpicureanism. First, it is the basis of Epicurus\u2019 demonstration\nthat the soul does not survive the death of the body (other arguments\nto this effect are presented in Lucretius 3.417\u2013614). The\nsoul\u2019s texture is too delicate to exist independently of the\nbody that contains it, and in any case the connection with the body is\nnecessary for sensation to occur. From this it follows that there can\nbe no punishment after death, nor any regrets for the life that has\nbeen lost. Second, the soul is responsive to physical impressions,\nwhether those that arrive from without in the form of laminas or\nsimulacra, or those that arise from internal motions of the body. No\nphenomena are purely mental, in the sense of being disembodied states\nor objects of pure consciousness conceived as separate from\nembodiment. The elementary sensations of pleasure and pain,\naccordingly, rather than abstract moral principles or abstract\nconcepts of goodness or badness, are the fundamental guides to what is\ngood and bad, since all sentient creatures are naturally attracted to\nthe one and repelled by the other. The function of the human mind\n\u2014 that part of the soul that is located in our chest \u2014 is\nnot to seek higher things, but to maximize pleasure and minimize pain.\nThat is its entire objective; the risk (a substantial one) is that it\nmay miscalculate, since it is subject to false beliefs and errors in\ncognitive processes.\n\nUnlike other Hellenistic schools, such as those of Aristotle and the\nStoics, the Epicureans were not greatly interested in formal logic,\nbut they certainly needed a theory of the formation of beliefs. As far\nas the ideational content of thinking \u2014 that is, the thought of\nsomething \u2014 is concerned, Epicurus proposed a radically\nreductive hypothesis: just as sensations occur as a result of thin\nfilms emitted by objects that enter the appropriate sense organ, so\ntoo some of these simulacra are fine enough to penetrate directly to\nthe mind (located in the chest), and that is how we imagine such\nobjects (e.g., gods). This process is invoked to explain not only\ndream images, but many kinds of mental impression, including\nimpressions constituting voluntary thought: the latter occurs when we\nattend to one or another of the exiguous physical films that are\ncontinuously floating through the air. (How we manage to attend\nvoluntarily to whichever of these films we choose is not explained in\nthe surviving sources.) Imagining a thing is thus nothing more than\npicking out the simulacra that have been emitted by it, and which may\nendure beyond the life of the thing itself (hence we can imagine the\ndead). These mental images have no privileged status, such as Plato\ngave to his noetic Ideas or Forms; they are always true, but in this\ndo not differ from the information provided by the senses. Mistakes\noccur here too when the wrong beliefs are associated with such\nimpressions, for example, that because we have a mental image of a\ndead person it follows that he or she still exists in a ghostly form.\nEpicurean physics proves that this is impossible.\n\nA great barrier to correct thinking is language itself, which, because\nit has a name for death, may suggest that death (being dead) is\nsomething a person can experience and hence deserves to be feared.\nWords must be understood in their basic sense, Epicurus says, as\nopposed to what he calls \u201cempty sounds\u201d (LH 37).\nThe culprit in misunderstanding is always an illegitimate inference\nfrom sensation (the latter including thoughts produced by film-like\nimages). An example is the belief that centaurs exist. Epicurus does\nnot deny that the thought of a centaur corresponds to some real\nstimulus in the form of simulacra: his theory of knowledge commits him\nto the view that it must. But the flimsy laminas as they float through\nthe air can become distorted or interfere with one another, and thus\nthe upper part of a human figure may get loosely attached to the lower\npart of a horse\u2019s. We know that this is unreal because such a\ncombination is physically impossible: horses and human beings mature\nat different rates, for example, and eat different foods (see\nLucretius 5.878\u201391; cf. Palaephatus On Incredible Tales\n20). Beliefs about whether sensations correspond to an actually\nexisting thing must be tested against knowledge of the world, as\ninformed by Epicurean theory.\n\nThe ability to reason or calculate (logismos) cannot be a\nfunction of images. It is the faculty that lets us infer by analogy\nfrom the visible world to the invisible, and also that with which we\nmay recognize that not all pleasures are to be chosen at all times,\nsince some immediate pleasures may lead to long-term pain or harm\n(Letter to Menoeceus = LM 129). What is more, one\nmust know something about the nature of pleasure in order to pursue it\nrationally, and likewise for pain. Epicurus, it appears, uses the\nterms pleasure and pain (h\u00eadon\u00ea,\nalg\u00ead\u00f4n) strictly in reference to physical\npath\u00ea or sensations, that is, those that are\nexperienced via the non-rational soul that is distributed throughout\nthe body. As for the rational part or mind, we have positive and\nnegative experiences through it too. Most prominent among the negative\nmental states is fear, above all the fear of unreal dangers, such as\ndeath. Death, Epicurus insists, is nothing to us, since while we\nexist, our death is not, and when our death occurs, we do not exist\n(LM 124\u201325); but if one is frightened by the empty name\nof death, the fear will persist since we must all eventually die. This\nfear is one source of perturbation (tarakh\u00ea), and is a\nworse curse than physical pain itself; the absence of such fear is\nataraxy, lack of perturbation, and ataraxy, together with freedom from\nphysical pain, is one way of specifying the goal of life, for\nEpicurus.\n\nThere are also positive states of mind, which Epicurus identifies by\nthe special term khara (joy), as opposed to\nh\u00eadon\u00ea (pleasure, i.e., physical pleasure). These\nstates too depend on belief, whether true or false. But Epicurus does\nnot treat khara as an end, or part of the end for living:\nrather, he tends to describe the goal by negation, as freedom from\nbodily pain and mental disturbance (LM 128). However,\nhappiness (eudaimonia), according to Epicurus, is not simply\na neutral or privative condition but rather a form of pleasure in its\nown right \u2014 what Epicurus called catastematic or (following\nCicero\u2019s Latin translation) \u201cstatic\u201d as opposed to\n\u201ckinetic\u201d pleasure. Although the precise nature of this\ndistinction is debated, kinetic pleasures seem to be of the\nnon-necessary kind (see below), such as those resulting from agreeable\nodors or sounds, rather than deriving from replenishment, as in the\ncase of hunger or thirst. The philosophical school known as the\nCyrenaics advocated increasing desires and seeking ever new ways of\ngratifying them.\n\nEpicurus objected that such pleasures are necessarily accompanied by\ndistress, for they depend upon a lack that is painful (Plato had\ndemonstrated the problematic nature of this kind of pleasure; see\nGorgias 496C\u2013497A, Philebus 31E\u201332D,\n46A\u201350C). In addition, augmenting desires tends to intensify\nrather than reduce the mental agitation (a distressful state of mind)\nthat Epicurean philosophy sought to eliminate. Catastematic pleasure,\non the contrary, is (or is taken in) a state rather than a process: it\nis the pleasure that accompanies well-being as such. The Cyrenaics and\nothers, such as Cicero, maintained, in turn, that this condition is\nnot pleasurable but rather neutral \u2014 neither pleasurable nor\npainful.\n\nFor Epicurus, there are some fears that are perfectly legitimate; so\ntoo are some desires. Epicurus offers a classification of desires into\nthree types: some are natural, others are empty; and natural desires\nare of two sorts, those that are necessary and those that are merely\nnatural (see Cooper 1999). Natural and necessary are those that look\nto happiness, physical well-being, or life itself (LM 127).\nUnnecessary but natural desires are for pleasant things like sweet\nodors and good-tasting food and drink (and for various pleasurable\nactivities of sorts other than simple smelling, touching and tasting).\nEmpty desires are those that have as their objects things designated\nby empty sounds, such as immortality, which cannot exist for human\nbeings and do not correspond to any genuine need. The same holds for\nthe desire for great wealth or for marks of fame, such as statues:\nthey cannot provide the security that is the genuine object of the\ndesire. Such desires, accordingly, can never be satisfied, any more\nthan the corresponding fears \u2014 e.g., the fear of death \u2014\ncan ever be alleviated, since neither has a genuine referent, i.e.,\ndeath as something harmful (when it is present, we do not exist) or\nwealth and power as salves for anxiety. Such empty fears and desires,\nbased on what Epicurus calls kenodoxia or empty belief, are\nthemselves the main source of perturbation and pain in civilized life,\nwhere more elementary dangers have been brought under control, since\nthey are the reason why people are driven to strive for limitless\nwealth and power, subjecting themselves to the very dangers they\nimagine they are avoiding.\n\nAlthough human beings, like everything else, are composed of atoms\nthat move according to their fixed laws, our actions are not wholly\npredetermined \u2014 rather than entertain such a paralyzing\ndoctrine, Epicurus says, it would be better to believe in the old\nmyths, for all their perversities (LM 134). What enables us\nto wrest liberty from a mechanistic universe is the existence of a\ncertain randomness in the motion of atoms, that takes the form of a\nminute swerve in their forward course (evidence for this doctrine\nderives chiefly from later sources, including Lucretius and Cicero).\nIt is not entirely clear how the swerve operates: it may involve a\nsmall angle of deviation from the original path, or else a slight\nshift sideways, perhaps by a single minimum, with no change in\ndirection. The idea of such a minute veering, said to occur at no\ndeterminate time or place, is less strange in the modern age of\nquantum physics than it was in Epicurus\u2019 time, and it gave rise\nto mocking critiques. More problematic today is how the swerve might\nexplain freedom of will \u2014 if indeed Epicurus\u2019 idea of the\nwill was like our own. It did, at all events, introduce an\nindeterminacy into the universe, and if soul atoms, thanks to their\nfineness, were more susceptible to the effects of such deviations than\ncoarser matter, the swerve could at least represent a breach in any\nstrict predestination of human behavior. And this might have been\nenough for Epicurus\u2019 purposes: he may not have invoked the\nswerve in order to explain voluntary action (claiming that it is\naction deriving, immediately or ultimately, from a swerve or some\nswerves of the soul\u2019s atoms). He may have wished merely to\nestablish the possibility of action not deriving from the positions of\nthe soul\u2019s constituent atoms at any time plus the effects of\ncollisions among them resulting from their given movements at that\ntime. According to Lucretius (2.225\u201350), the swerve was also put\nto use to solve a cosmological problem: if at some (as it were)\ninitial moment all atoms were moving uniformly in a single direction\n(downward) at the same speed, it is impossible to conceive how the\nprocess of atomic collisions could have begun, save by some such\ndevice. This seems a curious idea: given that time, like space, was\ninfinite according to Epicurus, he need not have imagined a time prior\nto collisions. Just possibly the tendency of atoms to emerge from\ncollisions in a preferred direction (by definition \u201cdown\u201d)\nmight lead over time to local regions of parallel motion, and the\nswerve could serve to reintroduce contact among them. In any event,\nEpicurus may have thought of atoms moving in some uniform direction\nrather than in diverse ones as a default position for physical theory\n(because of the simplicity of that hypothesis); thus he may have felt\nthe need to explain how the diversity of the atoms\u2019 motions\ncould have arisen.\n5. Social Theory\n\nAlthough our main witness for Epicurus\u2019 views on the evolution\nof human society is Lucretius\u2019 poem (5.925\u20131457), there is\nno doubt that Lucretius was following, in the main, the ideas of the\nfounder himself, as recorded in Epicurus\u2019 On Nature and\nother treatises. In the beginning, human beings were solitary; they\nreproduced haphazardly, could not communicate verbally, had no social\ninstitutions, and survived because they were physically hardier than\ntheir modern descendants. With time, the race softened, thanks in part\nto the discovery of fire, in part too to the emergence of the family\nand the gentler sentiments toward spouses and offspring to which the\nfamily gave rise. At this stage, human beings were in a position to\nunite in order to fend off natural dangers, such as wild beasts, and\nthey developed various kinds of technical skills, such as agriculture\nand the building of houses, as well as language. Epicurus explains\n(LH 75\u201376) that names at first arose naturally, in the\nsense that as human beings experienced different affects\n(path\u00ea) or received various images\n(phantasmata) they emitted air corresponding to these\nstimuli; since human physical characteristics vary somewhat from place\nto place, however, the sounds people produced in response to any given\nstimulus similarly differed, which explains why there are many\ntongues. Upon this basis, people later, nation by nation, established\ncertain terms by convention for the purpose of improving clarity and\nbrevity in communication. Finally, certain individual experts further\naugmented the vocabulary by the introduction of new and specialized\nwords, to explain the results of their theoretical investigations.\nOnce language reached a developed state, people began to establish\nalliances and friendships, which contributed further to collective\nsecurity.\n\nThis early form of social life had various advantages: among others,\nthe relative scarcity of goods prevented excessive competition\n(sharing was obligatory for survival) and thereby set limits on those\nunnatural desires that at a later, richer phase of society would lead\nto wars and other disturbances. It would appear too that, before\nlanguage had developed fully, words more or less conformed to their\noriginal or primitive objects, and were not yet a source of mental\nconfusion. But thanks to a gradual accumulation of wealth, the\nstruggle over goods came to infect social relations, and there emerged\nkings or tyrants who ruled over others not by virtue of their physical\nstrength but by dint of gold. These autocrats in turn were overthrown,\nand after a subsequent period of violent anarchy people finally saw\nthe wisdom of living under the rule of law. This might seem to\nrepresent the highest attainment in political organization, but that\nis not so for the Epicureans. For with law came the generalized fear\nof punishment that has contaminated the blessings of life (Lucretius\n5.1151; cf. [Philodemus] On Choices and Avoidances col. XII).\nLucretius at this point gives an acount of the origin of religious\nsuperstition and dread of the gods, and although he does not relate\nthis anxiety directly to the fear of punishment under human law, he\ndoes state that thunder and lightning are interpreted as signs that\nthe gods are angry at human sins (5.1218\u201325). While primitive\npeople in the presocial or early communal stages might have been awed\nby such manifestations of natural power and ascribed them to the\naction of the gods, they would not necessarily have explained them as\nchastisement for human crimes before the concept of punishment became\nfamiliar under the regime of law. People at an early time knew that\ngods exist thanks to the simulacra that they give off, although the\nprecise nature of the gods according to Epicurus remains obscure (for\ncontrasting intepretations, see Konstan 2011 and Sedley 2011); but the\ngods, for him, do not interest themselves in human affairs, since this\nwould compromise their beatitude (see Obbink 1996: 321\u201323).\n\nIf one does not fear the gods, what motive is there for living justly?\nWhere law obtains, Epicurus indicates, it is preferable not to commit\ncrimes, even secret ones, since there will always be anxiety over the\npossibility of detection, and this will disrupt the tranquillity or\nataraxy that is the chief basis of happiness in life (see\nPrincipal Beliefs = KD 34\u201335). Justice, for\nEpicurus, depends on the capacity to make compacts neither to harm\nothers nor be harmed by them, and consists precisely in these\ncompacts; justice is nothing in itself, independent of such\narrangements (KD 31\u201333). According to Epicurus\n(LM 132, KD 5), someone who is incapable of living\nprudently, honorably, and justly cannot live pleasurably, and vice\nversa. Moreover, prudence or wisdom (phron\u00easis) is the\nchief of the virtues: on it depend all the rest. This again sounds\ncalculating, as though justice were purely a pragmatic and selfish\nmatter of remaining unperturbed. Epicurus does not entertain the\nthought experiment proposed by Plato in the Republic\n(359C\u2013360D), in which Plato asks whether a person who is\nabsolutely secure from punishment would have reason to be just. Did\nEpicurus have an answer to such a challenge? He may simply have denied\nthat anyone can be perfectly confident in this way. Perhaps, however,\nhe did have a reply, but it was derived from the domain of psychology\nrather than of ethics. A person who understands what is desirable and\nwhat is to be feared would not be motivated to acquire inordinate\nwealth or power, but would lead a peaceful life to the extent\npossible, avoiding politics and the general fray. An Epicurean sage,\naccordingly, would have no motive to violate the rights of others.\nWhether the sage would be virtuous is perhaps moot; what Epicurus says\nis that he would live virtuously, that is prudently, honorably, and\njustly (the adverbial construction may be significant). He would do so\nnot because of an acquired disposition or hexis, as Aristotle\nhad it, but because he knows how to reason correctly about his needs.\nHence his desires would be limited to those that are natural (not\nempty), and so easily satisfied, or at least not a source of\ndisturbance if sometimes unsatisfied.\n6. The Epicurean Life\n\nEpicurus placed an extremely high value on friendship (or love:\nphilia). A saying with rather a more poetic flair than is\nEpicurus\u2019 custom runs: \u201cFriendship goes dancing round the\nworld, announcing to all of us to wake up to happiness\u201d\n(Vatican Saying = VS 52). Epicurus held that a wise\nman would feel the torture of a friend no less than his own, and would\ndie for a friend rather than betray him, for otherwise his own life\nwould be confounded (VS 56\u201357). These are powerfully\naltruistic sentiments for a philosopher who posits as the unique goal\nin life happiness based on freedom from physical pain and mental\nanxiety. Epicurus could justify such an attitude by the same\nprudential calculus that he uses to argue in favor of living justly:\nonly by living in such a way that loyalty to friends is perceived to\nbe a consummate value will one be able to feel secure in one\u2019s\nfriends, and thus maximize one\u2019s felicity. Yet this does not\nseem quite what Epicurus means when he says that \u201cfriendship [or\nlove] had its beginning as a result of utility, but is to be chosen\n[or is a virtue, if we follow the manuscript reading] for its own\nsake\u201d (VS 23). The question is further complicated by\nthe report in Cicero\u2019s On Moral Ends (1.66\u201370)\nthat there was a difference of opinion concerning friendship among\nlater Epicureans. Since human beings were originally asocial and only\nlater learned to form alliances and compacts, it is possible that\nEpicurus means to say that this capacity for friendship arose out of\nneed, but that once the capacity for such feelings was acquired,\nfeeling them came to be valued in itself. The argument would be\nsimilar to the modern idea that altruism could have developed as a\nresult of natural selection. But the evidence does not permit a firm\nconclusion on this matter.\n\nWhen Epicurus spoke of friendship, he may have had at least partly in\nmind specifically the relationship among his followers, who seem to\nhave thought of themselves as friends. Epicureans were encouraged to\nform communities and to observe certain rituals, although most of\nthese practices, such as the celebration each month of the day (the\n20th) on which Epicurus was born or wearing rings bearing\nan image of Epicurus, may have originated after the founder\u2019s\ndeath. The Epicureans paid attention to problems of pedagogy as well,\nlaying out the best way to correct the ideas of people new to the\nschool and its community without cajoling or discouraging them. It\nmust be remembered that Epicurus understood the task of philosophy\nfirst and foremost as a form of therapy for life, since philosophy\nthat does not heal the soul is no better than medicine that cannot\ncure the body (Usener 1887, frag. 221). A life free of mental anxiety\nand open to the enjoyment of other pleasures was deemed equal to that\nof the gods. Indeed, it is from the gods themselves, via the simulacra\nthat reach us from their abode, that we derive our image of blessed\nhappiness, and prayer for the Epicureans consisted not in petitioning\nfavors but rather in a receptivity to this vision. (Epicurus\nencouraged the practice of the conventional cults.) Although they held\nthe gods to be immortal and indestructible (how this might work in a\nmaterialist universe remains unclear), human pleasure might\nnevertheless equal divine, since pleasure, Epicurus maintained\n(KD 19), is not augmented by duration (compare the idea of\nperfect health, which is not more perfect for lasting longer); the\ncatastematic pleasure experienced by a human being completely free of\nmental distress and with no bodily pain to disturb him or her is at\nthe absolute top of the scale. Nor is such pleasure difficult to\nachieve: it is a mark precisely of those desires that are neither\nnatural nor necessary that they are hard to satisfy. Epicurus was\nfamously content with little, since on such a diet a small delicacy is\nas good as a feast, in addition to which it is easier to achieve\nself-sufficiency, and \u201cthe greatest benefit of self-sufficiency\nis freedom\u201d (VS 77).\n",
