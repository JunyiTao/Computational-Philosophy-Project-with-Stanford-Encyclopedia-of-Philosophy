    "main_text": "From Symbolic to Iconic Representation\n2. From Symbolic to Iconic Representation\n\nSo far, we have argued that Peirce\u2019s insight on relations pushed\nhim to extend the territory of logic from monadic,\nnon-relational, propositional logic to polyadic, relational,\nquantification logic. This is the beginning of modern logic as we know\nit. In this section, taking up a different angle of Peirce\u2019s\nadventure\u2014to extend forms of representation from\nsymbolic systems to diagrammatic systems, we present a story\nwhere his two different kinds of extension\u2014one from\nnon-relations to relations and the other from symbolic to\ndiagrammatic\u2014are connected with each other.\n\nPeirce presented propositional logic, quantification logic, and modal\nlogic in a graphical way, and invented three systems of Existential\nGraphs (EG)\u2014Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, respectively. In spite of\nPeirce\u2019s own evaluation of Existential Graphs as \u201cmy chef\nd\u2019oeuvre\u201d, EG had to wait to be understood for a half\ncentury until two philosophers\u2014Don Roberts and Jay\nZeman\u2014produced their impressive work. In the 1980s, EG was\nreceiving attention from new disciplines\u2014computer science and\nartificial intelligence\u2014thanks to John Sowa\u2019s novel\napplication of EG to knowledge representation in Conceptual\nStructure (1984). More recently, toward the end of the twentieth\ncentury interdisciplinary research on multi-modal reasoning has drawn\nour attention to non-symbolic systems (see, e.g., Barwise &\nAllwein [eds] 1996 and Barwise & Etchemendy 1991) and EG, not\nsurprisingly, occupied the top of their list. In that context, Shin\n(2002) focused on differences between symbolic versus diagrammatic\nsystems and suggested a new way of understanding the EG system, though\nthis was criticized in Pietarinen 2006.\n\nWhile Peirce mainly presented linear expressions in his official\nwritings from 1870 to\n 1885,[22]\n the notation adopted in Frege\u2019s 1879 Begriffsschrift\nis more iconic; it is at least not as linear as Peirce\u2019s in the\nabove period. However, it is Peirce, not Frege, who invented a\nfull-blown non-symbolic system for first-order logic\u2014Existential\nGraphs. It is Peirce\u2019s EG, not his linear first-order notation,\nwhich is presented as a deductive system with inference rules. As the\nEG system has been investigated more rigorously, philosophical\nquestions involving Peirce\u2019s invention of the system have been\nraised as well. The discovery of EG\u2019s power and novelty has\nnaturally led us to other parts of Peirce\u2019s philosophy. Why and\nhow did the invention of EG come about? What does EG reveal about\nPeirce\u2019s view of logic and representation?\n\nMany have pointed to Peirce\u2019s theory of signs, which classifies\nsigns as being of three kinds\u2014symbols, indices, and\nicons\u2014as the foremost theoretical background for Peirce\u2019s\n EG.[23]\n For example, as will be shown below, ovals and lines, along with\nletters, are the basic vocabulary of Peirce\u2019s EG. It is natural\nto connect Peirce\u2019s interest in icons with his invention of\ngraphical systems, and the connection is real (Shin 2002:\n22\u201335). However, to pinpoint the features of icons and the\niconic nature of Peirce\u2019s graphical systems requires much more\nwork than our intuition provides. Moreover, there is a big gap between\nPeirce\u2019s discussions of\n icons[24]\n and his invention of full-blown graphical systems; something else has\nto be brought into the picture to explain how Peirce got from his\ninitial ideas about icons all the way to his EG.\n\nIn a slightly different and bigger picture, van Heijenoort\u2019s\ndistinction between Boole\u2019s calculus ratiocinator\nversus Frege\u2019s lingua characteristica could be related\nto the topic. Agreeing with both Hintikka\u2019s and Goldfarb\u2019s\nevaluation that Peirce belongs to Boole\u2019s tradition, Shin finds\na connection between the model-theoretic view of logic (where Boole\nand Peirce are placed) and EG\u2019s birth (see Shin 2002:\n14\u201316 and Pietarinen 2006). However, Peirce\u2019s awareness of\nthe re-interpretation of language is necessary, but not sufficient,\nfor his pursuit of a different form of representation. While the\nacknowledgment of the possibility of different models of a given\nsystem was presupposed by Peirce\u2019s project for various kinds of\nsystems, not every Boolean has presented multiple systems. Boole\nhimself \n\n\nwas quite conscious of the idea of disinterpretaion, of the\nidea of using a mathematical system as an algorithm, transforming the\nsigns purely mechanically without any reliance on meanings. (Putnam\n1982: 294) \n\n\nOn the other hand, Burris and Legris\u2019s entry shows us how\nBoole\u2019s algebra of logic tradition has led us to the development\nof model theory (see the entry on\n the algebra of logic tradition).\n",
