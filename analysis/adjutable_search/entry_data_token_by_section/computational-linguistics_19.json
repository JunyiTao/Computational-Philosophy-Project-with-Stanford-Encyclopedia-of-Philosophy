    "main_text": "Language generation\n6. Language generation\nBecause language generation is a purposeful activity motivated by\ninternal goals, it is difficult to draw a boundary between\ngoal-directed thinking and the ensuing production of linguistic output.\nOften the process is divided into content\nplanning, microplanning,\nsurface realization, and physical\npresentation. While the last three of\nthese stages can be thought of as operating (in the order stated) on\nrelatively small chunks of information (e.g., resulting in one or two\nsentences or other utterance types), content planning  is often\nregarded as a continual process of goal-directed communicative\nplanning, which successively hands over small clusters of ideas to the\nremaining stages for actual generation when appropriate. We discuss the\nlatter transduction first, in order to highlight its relationship to\nunderstanding.\nThe transduction of a small set of internally represented ideas into\nwritten or oral text is in an obvious sense the inverse of the\nunderstanding process, as we have outlined it in the preceding sections\n2\u20135. In other words, starting from a few internally represented ideas\nto be communicated, we need to proceed to an orderly linear arrangement\nof these ideas, to a surface-oriented logical form that is concise and\nnonrepetitive and appropriately indexical (e.g., in the use of I, you,\nhere, now, and referring expressions), and finally to an actual\nsurface\nrealization and physical presentation of that realization as spoken or\nwritten text. Most or all of the kinds of knowledge involved in\nunderstanding naturally come into play in generation as well\u2014whether\nthe knowledge is about the structure of words and phrases, about the\nrelationship between structure and meaning representation, about\nconventional (or creative) ways of phrasing ideas, about discourse\nstructure and relations, or about the world.\nDespite this inverse relationship, language generation has\ntraditionally received less attention from computational linguists than\nlanguage understanding, because if the content to be verbalized is\navailable in an unambiguous, formal representation, standard output\ntemplates can often be used for generation, at least in sufficiently\nnarrow domains. Even for unrestricted domains, the transduction from an\nexplicit, unambiguous internal semantic representation to a word\nsequence is much less problematic than reconstruction of an explicit\nsemantic representation from an ambiguous word sequence. A similar\nasymmetry holds at the level of speech recognition and generation,\naccounting for the fact that serviceable speech generators (e.g.,\nreading machines for the blind) have been available much longer (since\nabout 1976) than serviceable speech recognizers (appearing around 1999).\nThe microplanning process that leads from a few internal ideas to a\nsurface-oriented, indexical representation typically starts by\nidentifying \u201cchunks\u201d expected to be verbalized as\nparticular types of syntactic constituents, such as NPs, VPs or\nPPs. This is often followed by making choices of more surface-oriented\nconcepts (or directly, lexical heads) in terms of which the chunks\nwill be expressed. The nature of these processes depends very much on\nthe internal representation. For example, if the representation is\nframed in terms of very abstract primitives, thematic relations, and\nattribute-value descriptions of entities, then the chunks might be\nsets of thematic relations centered around an action, and sets of\nsalient attributes of entities to be referred to. If the internal\nrepresentation is instead more language-like, then chunks will be\nrelatively small, often single propositions, and the lexical choice\nprocess will resemble internal paraphrasing of the logical forms. If\nmore than one idea is being verbalized, ordering decisions will need\nto be made. For example, reporting that a bandit brandishing a gun\nentered a local liquor store might be reported in that order, or as\n\u201cA bandit entered a local liquor store, brandishing a\ngun\u201d. In dialogue, if a contribution involves both supplying and\nrequesting information, the request should come last. In other cases\ntransformations to more concise forms may be needed to bring the\nrepresented ideas stylistically closer to surface form. For example,\nfrom logical forms expressing that John ate a burrito containing\nchicken meat and Mary ate a burrito containing chicken\nmeat, a more compact surface-oriented LF might be generated to\nthe effect that John and Mary each had a chicken\nburrito. More subtle stylistic choices might be made as\nwell\u2014for example, in casual discourse, eating might be\ndescribed as polishing off (assuming that the internal\nrepresentation allows for such surface-oriented distinctions).\nFurthermore, as already mentioned, a surface-oriented LF needs to\nintroduce contextually appropriate referring expressions such as\ndefinite descriptions and pronouns, in conformity with pragmatic\nconstraints on the usage of such expressions.\nThe above outline is simplified in that it neglects certain\nsubtleties of discourse and context. A sentence or other utterance\ntype generally involves both new and old (given,\npresupposed) information, and furthermore, some of the concepts\ninvolved may be more strongly focused than others. For example, in the\nsentence \u201cThe item you ordered costs ninety dollars, not\nnine,\u201d the existence and identity of the item, and the fact that\nit was ordered, are presumed to be part of the common ground in the\ncurrent context (old), and so is the addressee's belief that the cost\nof the item is $9; only the corrected cost of $90 is new\ninformation. The emphasis on ninety draws attention to the\npart of the presumed belief that is being corrected. Thus it is not\nonly conceptual content that needs to be available to the\nmicroplanning stage, but also indications as to what is new and what\nis old, and what aspects are to be stressed or focused. The planner\nneeds at least to apply knowledge about the phrasing of new and old\ninformation (e.g., the use of indefinite vs. definite NPs), about the\nlexical presuppositions and implicatures of the items used (e.g., that\nsucceeding presupposes trying, that regretting\nthat \u03c6 presupposes that \u03c6, or that some\nimplicates not all), about the presuppositions of stress\npatterns, and about focusing devices (such as stress and\ntopicalization). The effect of applying these sorts of pragmatic\nknowledge will be to appropriately configure the surface-oriented LFs\nthat are handed off to the surface realizer, or, for pragmatic\nfeatures that cannot be incorporated into the LFs, to annotate the LFs\nwith these features (e.g., stress marking).\nThe penultimate step is surface realization, using knowledge about the\nsyntax-semantics interface. In systems for restricted domains, this\nknowledge might consist of heuristic rules and templates (perhaps tree\nschemas) for verbalizing LFs. More broadly-aimed generators might make\nuse of invertible grammars,\nones formulated in rule-to-rule fashion and\nallowing transduction from logical forms to surface forms in much the\nsame way as the \u201cforward\u201d transduction from surface phrase structure to\nlogical form. Sophisticated generators also need to take account of\npragmatic annotations, such as stress, mentioned above. Finally, the\nlinguistically expressed content needs to be physically presented as\nspoken or written text, with due attention to articulation, stress, and\nintonation, or, for written text, punctuation, capitalization, choice\nof a or an as indefinite article, italics, line breaks, and so on.\nReturning now to content planning, this process may be expansive or\nvery limited in scope; for example, it may be aimed at providing\ndetails of a complex object, set of events, or argument, or it may seek\nto present no more than a single fact, greeting or acknowledgment. We\nleave discussion of the strongly interactive type of content planning\nneeded for dialogue to the following section, while we comment here on\nthe more expansive sorts of text generation. In this case the\norganization of the information to be presented is the central concern.\nFor example, the events of a narrative or the steps of a procedure\nwould generally be arranged chronologically; arguments for a conclusion\nmight be arranged so that any subarguments intended to buttress the\npresumptions of that step (immediately) precede it; descriptions of\nobjects might proceed from major characteristics and parts to details.\nAn early method of producing well-organized, paragraph-length\ndescriptions and comparisons was pioneered in the TEXT system of\nMcKeown (1985), which used ATN-like organizational schemas to sequence\nsections of the description of a type of object, such as the object's\nmore general type, its major parts and distinctive attributes, and\nillustrative examples. Later work by Hovy (1988) and Moore and Paris\n(1988) tied content planning more closely to communicative goals by\nrelying on rhetorical structure theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson\n1987). RST posits over 20 possible coherence relations between spans\nof text (usually adjacent).  For example, a statement of some claim\nmay be followed by putative evidence for the claim, thus establishing\nan evidence relation between the claim (called the\nnucleus, because it is the main point) and the cited evidence\n(called a satellite because of its subsidiary role).  Another\nexample is the volitional result relation, where the nuclear\ntext span describes a situation or event of interest, and the\nsatellite describes a deliberate action that caused the situation or\nevent. Often these relations are signalled by discourse markers (cue\nwords and phrases), such as but, when, yet, or after\nall, and it is important in text generation to use these markers\nappropriately. For example, the use of when in the following\nsentence enhances coherence,\n\n(6.1) John\nhung up the phone when the caller asked for his social\nsecurity number,\n\nby signalling a possible volitional result relation. Text spans\nlinked by rhetorical relations may consist of single or multiple\nsentences, potentially leading to a recursive (though not necessarily\nstrictly nested) structure. Rhetorical relations can serve\ncommunicative goals such as concept comprehension (e.g., via\nelaboration of a definition), belief (via presentation of evidence),\nor causal understanding (e.g., via a volitional result relation, as in\n(6.1)), and in this way tighten the connection between content\nplanning and communicative goals.\n",
