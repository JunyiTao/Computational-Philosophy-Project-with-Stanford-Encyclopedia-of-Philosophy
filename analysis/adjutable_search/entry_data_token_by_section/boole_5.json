    "main_text": "The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) || Operations and Laws for Elective Symbols\n3.3 Operations and Laws for Elective Symbols\n\nThe first operation that Boole introduced was multiplication\n\\(xy\\). The standard juxtaposition notation \\(xy\\) for multiplication also \nhad a standard meaning for operators (for example, differential operators), \nnamely one applied \\(y\\) to an object and then \\(x\\) is applied to the\nresult.  As pointed out by \nTheodore Hailperin (1916\u20132014) \n(1981, p. 176; and 1986, pp. 67,68), \nthis established notation\nconvention handed Boole his interpretation of the multiplication \\(xy\\) of\nelective symbols as the composition of the two operators. Thus when \nencountering\nthe expression \\(xy\\) without a subject one was dealing with the class\n\\(x(y(1))\\), \u201cthe result being the class whose members \nare both Xs and Ys\u201d. We call this class the intersection\nof \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). In LT Boole dropped the (unnecessary) use of elective \nsymbols and simply let \\(x\\), \\(y\\) denote classes, with \\(xy\\) being their \nintersection. \n\nThe first law in MAL (p. 16) was the distributive law\n\n\\[\nx(u+v) = xu + xv,\n\\]\n\n\n\nwhere Boole said that \\(u+v\\) corresponded to dividing a class into two parts, \nevidently meaning \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are disjoint classes. \nThis was the first mention of addition in MAL. \n\n\nHe added (MAL, p. 17) the commutative law \\(xy =\nyx\\) and the index law \\(x^n = x\\)\u2014in LT the\nlatter would be replaced by the law of duality \\(x^2 = x\\)\n(called the idempotent law in 1870 by the Harvard\nmathematician Benjamin Peirce (1809\u20131880), in another\ncontext).\n\nAfter stating the above distributive and commutative laws, Boole\nbelieved he was entitled to fully employ the ordinary algebra of his\ntime, saying (MAL, p. 18) that\n\nall the processes of Common Algebra are applicable to the present system.\n\n Boole went beyond the foundations of symbolical algebra that\nGregory had used in 1840\u2014he added De Morgan\u2019s 1841 single\nrule of inference, that equivalent operations performed upon\nequivalent subjects produce equivalent results.\n",
