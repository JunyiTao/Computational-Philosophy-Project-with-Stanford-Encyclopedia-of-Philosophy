    "main_text": "Psychology || Soul, Spirit and Body\n4.2 Soul, Spirit and Body\n\nIsaac Israeli did not believe in the ensoulment of souls in bodies.\nThe three souls, despite their role in the governance of the body, and\nthe role of bodily sense perception in conveying information to the\nrational soul, remained outside the body. In his Book on Spirit\nand Soul, Israeli utilizes scriptural proof texts to argue that\nthe rational soul is what entitles mankind to reward or punishment\nafter death. But he writes tersely and vaguely on the subject of\nreward and punishment and does not explicitly clarify the relationship\nbetween the generic rational soul and rational souls of individuals.\nPresumably, we all have separate rational souls, otherwise the idea of\nreward and punishment of rational souls makes no sense. He notes that\nthe perfect actions of man pass beyond the corporeal sphere while\nthose actions to satisfy bodily appetites do not. Further, he affirms\nthat the soul of the righteous will endure in the upper realm with the\nintellect. Although he has sidestepped the traditional Rabbinic Jewish\nconception of bodily resurrection of the righteous by stating that the\nworld to come is the upper non-physical world, he does not spell out\nwhether this dwelling entails reintegration of one\u2019s rational\nsoul with the intellect, or a separate yet proximate existence.\n\nIsraeli, like the physician Qusta Ibn Luqa (ca. 835\u2013912), argued\nthat in addition to its connection with souls, a living being has a\nvital spirit, which unlike souls, is contained within the body and\ndies with the body, and he employs scripture (Psalms 78: 39) to argue\nthis point. Altmann and Stern show that Israeli\u2019s text very\nclosely parallels Ibn Luqa\u2019s, hence either derived it directly\nfrom the former, or they both are quoting the same prior source.\n(Isaac Israeli, p. 50)\n",
