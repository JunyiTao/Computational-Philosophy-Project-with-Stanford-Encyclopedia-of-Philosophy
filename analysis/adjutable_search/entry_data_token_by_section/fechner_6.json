    "main_text": "The Existence of Atoms\n7. Theory of Mind\n\nBeginning in Zend-Avesta Fechner set forth a theory of\nmind-body relations, which he then expounded in greater detail in his\nUeber die Seelenfrage and Elemente der Psychophysik.\nThis theory has been explained in great detail by Michael Heidelberger\n(2004: 73\u2013115), who regards it as Fechner\u2019s most important\ncontribution to philosophy. There is no necessary connection between\nthis theory and Fechner\u2019s panpsychism: the theory could be true\neven if human minds where the only minds in the universe; panpsychism\nis more about the extent rather than the nature of mind.\n\nFechner\u2019s theory begins with a distinction between two\nstandpoints, two ways of observing or knowing a human being. There is\nan internal and external standpoint, corresponding to which there are\ntwo kinds of appearances of a human being, internal and external\nappearances. An internal appearance is how I appear to myself or\nself-appearance; an external appearance is how I appear to\nothers. There are two kinds of knowledge corresponding to each kind of\nappearance. We know ourselves as minds immediately, i.e., intuitively\nor directly and without the need to make an inference; but we know\nothers mediately, i.e., intellectually or indirectly, through\ninferences we make from certain signs, viz., actions or words.\n\nThe main point that Fechner makes about these standpoints is that\ntheir appearances belong to one and the same thing. There are not two\ndistinct entities, a mind corresponding to internal appearances and a\nbody corresponding to external appearances; rather, there is one and\nthe same thing that appears inwardly to myself and outwardly to\nothers. \u201cInwardly it appears to itself thus; and outwardly it\nappears thus; but what appears is one and the same\u201d\n(ZA: 253). Hence Fechner\u2019s theory has been described as\na \u201ctwo aspect theory\u201d of the self. \n\nThis is the simplest formulation of the theory. It becomes more\ncomplicated, however, when Fechner adds other claims to it. The most\nstriking of these claims is that the mind and body are nothing but\ntheir appearances. The mind is nothing but its (actual and possible)\nappearances to itself; and the body is nothing but its (actual and\npossible) appearances to others. There is no mind in itself beyond how\nit appears to itself; and there is no body in itself, apart from and\nprior to how it appears to others. The theory then is a form of\n\u201cneutral monism\u201d, according to which there is one and the\nsame kind of thing which has two aspects or attributes depending on\nhow it is\n viewed.[14]\n This thing consists in only its appearances, whether internal or\nexternal.\n\nAnother claim that Fechner adds to his theory is that the two\nappearances are connected to one another in a causal or law-like way\n(see 1861: 211 and ZA: 253). Hence he says explicitly that\nthey are in a relation of interchange (Wechselbedingheit),\nthat they are intimately connected with one another (solidarisch\nzusammenhangen) (1861: 211). This is notable because some dual\naspect theories exclude the possibility of any interaction between the\nmental and physical appearances precisely because they are such\ndifferent kinds of attribute. Spinoza, for example, forbade any causal\ninteraction between the mental and physical because they were such\ndifferent kinds of attribute of substance (Spinoza 1677: Pars Prima,\nPropositio VI & X). Fechner saw the interaction as problematic, as\ndifficult to explain, but he did not forbid its possibility. Despite\nall the differences between mental and physical characteristics, he\nassumed that they referred to distinct events which, somehow, could\ninteract. The whole purpose of his Psychophysik was to\nexplain the interaction between them. \n\nStill another puzzling claim added to Fechner\u2019s theory is what\nhe calls \u201cthe most universal law of psychophysics\u201d: that\nnothing exists, originates or acts in the mind without something\nexisting, originating or acting in the body; in other words,\neverything mental has its expression in the physical (1861: 211). This\nprinciple seems to bias the connection between mind and body, so that\nthe mind appears as the body but not conversely; but the theory\noriginally called for a reciprocal connection or interaction\nbetween mind and body (as we have just seen above).\n\nIt is on the basis of this universal law that Fechner\u2019s theory\nhas been described as \u201cmaterialist\u201d (Heidelberger 2004:\n98, 107). This is an odd description, though, because the law seems to\npostulate that the mind has an efficacy on the body rather than the\nconversely. Materialist theories are often epiphenomenal, allowing the\ncausal direction to move only from the body to the mind. But\nFechner\u2019s law seems to say the opposite. \n\nWe will leave aside, for reasons of space, further complications in\nFechner\u2019s theory. To avoid serious confusion, though, it is\nnecessary to consider, if only briefly, the origins of the\n theory.[15]\n Fechner himself stated that his theory had its roots in\nSchelling\u2019s Naturphilosophie (Atom: xiv).\nThere is a certain plausibility to Fechner\u2019s genealogy. In the\nearly 1800s Schelling had developed his own dual aspect theory of the\nmind and body, according to which the mental and physical, the ideal\nand the real, are two equal and independent appearances of the\nabsolute. We need not cast doubt on Fechner\u2019s genealogy. The\ninitial impetus for his dual aspect theory might indeed have\nbeen Schelling; perhaps, if he had not read Schelling, he would never\nhave suggested a dual aspect theory. Still, it is important to see\nthat Fechner developed his theory along lines completely different\nfrom Schelling\u2019s. It was a fundamental principle of\nSchelling\u2019s theory that the mental and physical are one and the\nsame because they are different manifestations or appearances of\nliving force; the mental is the highest organization and development\nof that force, the physical is its lowest organization and\ndevelopment. His theory therefore rested upon the dynamic theory of\nmatter central to his Naturphilosophie. But Fechner, as we\nhave seen, rejected this theory, which was in conflict with his\natomism. Furthermore, Schelling, like Spinoza, forbade the possibility\nof interaction between the mental and physical, the very possibility\nthat Fechner wanted to investigate (Schelling 1859: I/4, 344). \n",
