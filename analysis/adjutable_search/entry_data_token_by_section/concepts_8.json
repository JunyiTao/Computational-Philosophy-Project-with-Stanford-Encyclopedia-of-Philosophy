    "main_text": "The structure of concepts || Conceptual atomism\n2.4 Conceptual atomism\n\nA radical alternative to all of the theories we\u2019ve mentioned so\nfar is conceptual atomism, the view that lexical concepts\nhave no semantic structure (Fodor 1998, Millikan 2000). According to\nconceptual atomism, the content of a concept isn\u2019t determined by\nits relation to other concepts but by its relation to the world.\n\nConceptual atomism follows in the anti-descriptivist tradition that\ntraces back to Saul Kripke, Hilary Putnam, and others working in the\nphilosophy of language (see Kripke 1972/80, Putnam 1975, Devitt 1981).\nKripke, for example, argues that proper names function like mere tags\nin that they have no descriptive content (Kripke 1972/80). On a\ndescription theory one might suppose that \u201cG\u00f6del\u201d\nmeans something like the discoverer of the incompleteness of\narithmetic. But Kripke points out we could discover that Schmitt\nreally discovered the incompleteness of arithmetic and that G\u00f6del\ncould have killed Schmitt and passed the work off as his own. The\npoint is that if the description theory were correct, we would be\nreferring to Schmitt when we say \u201cG\u00f6del\u201d. But\nintuitively that\u2019s not the case at all. In the imagined\nscenario, the sentence \u201cG\u00f6del discovered the incompleteness\nof arithmetic\u201d is saying something false about G\u00f6del, not\nsomething trivially true about the discoverer of the incompleteness of\narithmetic, whoever that might be (though see Machery et al. 2004 on\nwhether this intuition is universal and Genone 2012 for discussion of\nthe role of intuitions in theories of reference). Kripke\u2019s\nalternative account of names is that they achieve their reference by\nstanding in a causal relation to their referents. Conceptual atomism\nemploys a similar strategy while extending the model to all sorts of\nconcepts, not just ones for proper names.\n",
