    "main_text": "Individual and Community\n3. Individual and Community\n\n\nWiredu's critics have argued that he fails to recognize that\nindividuals have their own wills and can, at least to some degree,\nchoose their own goals. His position seems to endorse a form of\n\u2018tyranny\u2019 of the community over the individual. Gyekye\ninsists that this is wrong\u2014both descriptively and normatively\n(Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 105 note 20).  He agrees that \u201cthe\nwhole gamut of values and practices in which the individual is\nnecessarily embedded is a creation of cultural community and is part\nof his history\u201d and that this indicates a close relationship\nbetween the communal structure and individual's goals (Wiredu\n& Gyekye 1992, 112 note 20).  Yet this close relationship hardly\nimplies that the communal structure is the only factor the individual\nis required to consider in analyzing these goals.  According to\nGyekye,\n\n\n[I]ndividual persons as participants in the shared values and\npractices, and enmeshed in the web of communal relationships, may find\nthat aspects of those cultural givens are inelegant, undignifying or\nunenlightening and can thoughtfully be questioned and evaluated. The\nevaluation may result in individual's affirming or amending or\nrefining existing communal goals, values and practices; but it may or\ncould also result in the individual's total rejection of them.\nThe possibility of reevaluation means, surely that the person cannot\nbe absorbed by the communal or cultural apparatuses (Wiredu &\nGyekye 1992, 112 note 20).\n\n\nBy reserving for individuals at least the potential for responding to\nor rejecting the communal consensus, Gyekye locates a source of\nidentity that is in some meaningful way independent of any particular\nsociety. This is a self that can \u201cparticipate in the\n determination or definition of its own \n identity.\u201d[5]\n (Wiredu & Gyekye 1992, 112).\n\n\nGyekye correctly recognizes that the possibility of self-criticism\nrequires that one be able to distance oneself from one's own community\nor circumstances: However, it is not clear that this is a particularly\nserious problem for Wiredu's account, for even Wiredu allows that\nindividuals can critically assess their communal values. It is, after\nall, this ability to look at one's culture with new (and critical)\neyes that makes moral reformers (of which there have been many among\nthe Akan) possible. These moral reformers may stand against the\ncommunal values but the ones that may make an impact and be selected\nfor reincarnation as an ancestor is one that give reasons to\nreject or revise values that persuade the community. Understood in\nthis way, moral reformers not only have a place in Akan society, but\nqualify as persons with secured \u2018tickets\u2019 to the ancestral\nworld.\n",
