Introduction\n\nIn his (1980), Peter Unger introduced the \u201cProblem of the\nMany\u201d. A similar problem appeared simultaneously in P. T. Geach\n(1980), but Unger\u2019s presentation has been the most influential\nover recent years. The problem initially looks like a special kind of\npuzzle about\n vague predicates,\n but that may be misleading. Some of the standard solutions to\n Sorites paradoxes\n do not obviously help here, so perhaps the Problem reveals some\ndeeper truths involving the metaphysics of material constitution, or\nthe logic of statements involving identity.\n\nThe puzzle arises as soon as there is an object without clearly\ndemarcated borders. Unger suggested that clouds are paradigms of this\nphenomenon, and recent authors such as David Lewis (1993) and Neil\nMcKinnon (2002) have followed him here. Here is Lewis\u2019s\npresentation of the puzzle:\n\nThink of a cloud\u2014just one cloud, and around it a clear blue sky.\nSeen from the ground, the cloud may seem to have a sharp boundary. Not\nso. The cloud is a swarm of water droplets. At the outskirts of the\ncloud, the density of the droplets falls off. Eventually they are so\nfew and far between that we may hesitate to say that the outlying\ndroplets are still part of the cloud at all; perhaps we might better\nsay only that they are near the cloud. But the transition is gradual.\nMany surfaces are equally good candidates to be the boundary of the\ncloud. Therefore many aggregates of droplets, some more inclusive and\nsome less inclusive (and some inclusive in different ways than\nothers), are equally good candidates to be the cloud. Since they have\nequal claim, how can we say that the cloud is one of these aggregates\nrather than another? But if all of them count as clouds, then we have\nmany clouds rather than one. And if none of them count, each one being\nruled out because of the competition from the others, then we have no\ncloud. How is it, then, that we have just one cloud? And yet we do.\n(Lewis 1993: 164)\n\n\nThe paradox arises because in the story as told the following eight\nclaims each seem to be true, but they are mutually inconsistent.\n\nThere are several distinct sets of water droplets\nsk such that for each such set, it is not clear\nwhether the water droplets in sk form a\ncloud.\nThere is a cloud in the sky.\nThere is at most one cloud in the sky.\nFor each set sk, there is an object\nok that the water droplets in\nsk compose.\nIf the water droplets in si compose\noi, and the objects in sj\ncompose oj, and the sets si\nand sk are not identical, then the objects\noi and oj are not\nidentical.\nIf oi is a cloud in the sky, and\noj is a cloud in the sky, and\noi is not identical with oj,\nthen there are at least two clouds in the sky.\nIf any of these sets si is such that its\nmembers compose a cloud, then for any other set\nsj, if its members compose an object\noj, then oj is a cloud.\nAny cloud is composed of a set of water droplets.\n\n\nTo see the inconsistency, note that by 1 and 7 there is a cloud\ncomposed of water droplets. Say this cloud is composed of the water\ndroplets in si, and let sj be\nany other set whose members might, for all we can tell, form a cloud.\n(Premise 0 guarantees the existence of such a set.) By 3, the water\ndroplets in sj compose an object\noj. By 4, oj is not identical\nto our original cloud. By 6, oj is a cloud, and\nsince it is transparently in the sky, it is a cloud in the sky. By 5,\nthere are at least two clouds in the sky. But this is inconsistent\nwith 2. A solution to the paradox must provide a reason for rejecting\none of the premises, or a reason to reject the reasoning that led us\nto the contradiction, or the means to live with the contradiction.\nSince none of the motivations for believing in the existence of\n dialetheia\n apply here, let us ignore the last possibility. And since 0 follows\ndirectly from the way the story is told, let us ignore that option as\nwell. That leaves open eight possibilities.\n\n(The classification of the solutions here is slightly\ndifferent from that in Chapter One of Hud Hudson\u2019s \u201cA\nMaterialist Metaphysics of the Human Person.\u201d But it has a deep\ndebt to Hudson\u2019s presentation of the range of solutions, which\nshould be clear from the discussion that follows.)\n2. Nihilism\n\nUnger\u2019s original solution was to reject 1. The concept of a\ncloud involved, he thought, inconsistent presuppositions. Since those\npresuppositions were not satisfied, there are no clouds. This is a\nrather radical move, since it applies not just to clouds, but to any\nkind of sortal for which a similar problem can be generated. And,\nUnger pointed out, this includes most sortals. As Lewis puts it,\n\u201cThink of a rusty nail, and the gradual transition from steel\n\u2026 to rust merely resting on the nail. Or think of a cathode,\nand its departing electrons. Or think of anything that undergoes\nevaporation or erosion or abrasion. Or think of yourself, or any\norganism, with parts that gradually come loose in metabolism or\nexcretion or perspiration or shedding of dead skin\u201d (Lewis 1993:\n165).\n\nDespite Lewis\u2019s presentation, the Problem of the Many is not a\nproblem about change. The salient feature of these examples is that,\nin practice, change is a slow process. Hence whenever a cathode, or a\nhuman, is changing, be it by shedding electrons, or shedding skin,\nthere are some things that are not clearly part of the object, nor\nclearly not part of it. Hence there are distinct sets that each have a\ngood claim to being the set of parts of the cathode, or of the human,\nand that is what is important.\n\nIt would be profoundly counterintuitive if there were no clouds, or no\ncathodes, or no humans, and that is probably enough to reject the\nposition, if any of the alternatives are not also equally\ncounterintuitive. It also, as Unger noted, creates difficulties for\nmany views about singular thought and talk. Intuitively, we can pick\nout one of the objects composed of water droplets by the phrase\n\u2018that cloud\u2019. But if it is not a cloud, then possibly we\ncannot. For similar reasons, we may not be able to name any such\nobject, if we use any kind of reference-fixing description involving\n\u2018cloud\u2019 to pick it out from other objects composed of\nwater droplets. If the Problem of the Many applies to humans as well\nas clouds, then by similar reasoning we cannot name or demonstrate any\nhuman, or, if you think there are no humans, any human-like object.\nUnger was happy to take these results to be philosophical discoveries,\nbut they are so counterintuitive that most theorists hold that they\nform a reductio of his theory. Bradley Rettler (2018) argues that the\nnihilist has even more problems than this. Nihilism solves some\nphilosophical problems, such as explaining which of 0\u20137 is false. But,\nhe argues, for any problem it solves, there is a parallel problem\nwhich it does not solve, but rival solutions do solve. For instance,\nif you think of the problem here as a version of a\n Sorites paradox,\n nihilism does not help with versions of the paradox which concern\npredicates applied to simples.\n\nIt is interesting that some other theories of vagueness have adopted\npositions resembling Unger\u2019s in some respects, but without the\nextreme conclusions. Matti Eklund (2002) and Roy Sorensen (2001) have\nargued that all vague concepts involve inconsistent presuppositions.\nSorensen spells this out by saying that there are some inconsistent\npropositions that anyone who possesses a vague concept should believe.\nIn the case of a vague predicate F that is vulnerable to a\nSorites paradox, the inconsistent propositions are that some things\nare Fs, some things are not Fs, any object that\nclosely resembles (in a suitable respect) something that is F\nis itself F, and that there are chains of \u2018suitably\nresembling\u2019 objects between an F and a non-F.\nHere the inconsistent propositions are that a story like Lewis\u2019s\nis possible, and in it 0 through 7 are true. Neither Eklund nor\nSorensen conclude from this that nothing satisfies the predicates in\nquestion; rather they conclude that some propositions that we find\ncompelling merely in virtue of possessing the concepts from which they\nare constituted are false. So while they don\u2019t adopt\nUnger\u2019s nihilist conclusions, two contemporary theorists agree\nwith him that vague concepts are in some sense incoherent.\n3. Overpopulation\n\nA simple solution to the puzzle is to reject premise 2. Each of the\nrelevant fusions of water droplets looks and acts like a cloud, so it\nis a cloud. As with the first option this leads to some very\ncounterintuitive results. In any room with at least one person, there\nare many millions of people. But this is not as bad as saying that\nthere are no people. And perhaps we don\u2019t even have\nto say the striking claim. In many circumstances, we quantify\nover a restricted domain. We can say, \u201cThere\u2019s no\nbeer,\u201d even when there is beer in some non-salient locales. With\nrespect to some restricted quantifier domains, it is true that there\nis exactly one person in a particular room. The surprising result is\nthat with respect to other quantifier domains, there are many millions\nof people in that room. The defender of the overpopulation theory will\nhold that this shows how unusual it is to use unrestricted\nquantifiers, not that there really is only one person in the room.\n\nThe overpopulation solution is not popular, but it is not without\ndefenders. J. Robert G. Williams (2006) endorses it, largely because\nof a tension between the supervaluationist solution (that will be\ndiscussed in section 7) and what supervaluationism says about the\nSorites paradox. James Openshaw (2021) and Alexander Sandgren\n(forthcoming) argue that the overpopulation solution is true, and each\noffer a theory of how singular thought about the cloud is possible\ngiven overpopulation. Sandgren also points out that there might be\nmultiple sources of overpopulation. Even given a particular set of\nwater droplets, some metaphysical theories will say that there are\nmultiple objects those droplets compose, which differ in their\ntemporal or modal properties. \n\nHudson (2001: 39\u201344) draws out a surprising consequence of the\noverpopulation solution as applied to people. Assume that there are\nreally millions of people just where we\u2019d normally say there was\nexactly one. Call that person Charlie. When Charlie raises her arm,\neach of the millions must also raise their arms, for the millions\ndiffer only in whether or not they contain some borderline skin cells,\nnot in whether their arm is raised or lowered. Normally, if two people\nare such that whenever one acts a certain way, then so must the other,\nwe would say that at most one of them is acting freely. So it looks\nlike at most one of the millions of people around Charlie are free.\nThere are a few possible responses here, though whether a defender of\nthe overpopulation view will view this consequence as being more\ncounter-intuitive than other claims to which she is already committed,\nand hence whether it needs a special response, is not clear. There are\nsome other striking, though not always philosophically relevant,\nfeatures of this solution. To quote Hudson:\n\nAmong the most troublesome are worries about naming and singular\nreference \u2026 how can any of us ever hope to successfully refer\nto himself without referring to his brothers as well? Or how might we\nhave a little private time to tell just one of our sons of our\naffection for him without sharing the moment with uncountably many of\nhis brothers? Or how might we follow through on our vow to practice\nmonogamy? (Hudson 2001: 39)\n\n4. Brutalism\n\nAs Unger originally states it, the puzzle relies on a contentious\nprinciple of mereology. In particular, it assumes mereological\nUniversalism, the view that for any objects, there is an object that\nhas all of them as its fusion. (That is, it has each of those objects\nas parts, and has no parts that do not overlap at least one of the\noriginal objects.) Without this assumption, the Problem of the Many\nmay have an easy solution. The cloud in the sky is the object\nup there that is a fusion of water droplets. There are many other sets\nof water droplets, other than the set of water droplets that compose\nthe cloud, but since the members of those sets do not compose an\nobject, they do not compose a cloud.\n\nThere are two kinds of theories that imply that only one of the sets\nof water droplets is such that there exists a fusion of its atoms.\nFirst, there are principled restrictions on composition,\ntheories that say that the xs compose an object y\niff the xs are F, for some natural property\nF. Secondly, there are brutal theories, which say\nit\u2019s just a brute fact that in some cases the xs\ncompose an object, and in others they do not. It would be quite hard\nto imagine a principled theory solving the Problem of the Many, since\nit is hard to see what the principle could be. (For a more detailed\nargument for this, set against a somewhat different backdrop, see\nMcKinnon 2002.) But a brutal theory could work. And such a theory has\nbeen defended. Ned Markosian (1998) argues that not only does\nbrutalism, the doctrine that there are brute facts about when the\nxs compose a y, solve the Problem of the Many, the\naccount of composition it implies fits more naturally with our\nintuitions about composition.\n\nIt seems objectionable, in some not easy-to-pin-down way, to rely on\nbrute facts in just this way. Here is how Terrence Horgan puts the\nobjection:\n\nIn particular, a good metaphysical theory or scientific theory should\navoid positing a plethora of quite specific, disconnected, sui\ngeneris, compositional facts. Such facts would be ontological\ndanglers; they would be metaphysically queer. Even though explanation\npresumably must bottom out somewhere, it is just not credible\u2014or\neven intelligible\u2014that it should bottom out with specific\ncompositional facts which themselves are utterly unexplainable and\nwhich do not conform to any systematic general principles. (Horgan\n1993: 694\u20135)\n\n\nOn the other hand, this kind of view does provide a particularly\nstraightforward solution to the Problem of the Many. As Markosian\nnotes, if we have independent reason to view favourably the idea that\nfacts about when some things compose an object are brute facts, which\nhe thinks is provided by our intuitions about cases of composition and\nnon-composition, the very simplicity of this solution to the Problem\nof the Many may count as an argument in favour of brutalism.\n5. Relative Identity\n\nAssume that the brutalist is wrong, and that for every set of water\ndroplets, there is an object those water droplets compose. Since that\nobject looks for all the world like a cloud, we will say it is a\ncloud. The fourth solution accepts those claims, but denies that there\nare many clouds. It is true that there are many fusions of atoms, but\nthese are all the same cloud. This view adopts a position\nmost commonly associated with P. T. Geach (1980), that two things can\nbe the same F but not the same G, even though they\nare both Gs. To see the motivation for that position, and a\ndiscussion of its strengths and weaknesses, see the article on\n relative identity.\n\nHere is one objection that many have felt is telling against the\nrelative identity view: Let w be a water droplet that is\nin s1 but not s2. The relative\nidentity solution says that the droplets in\ns1 compose an object o1, and\nthe droplets in s2 compose an object\no2, and though o1 and\no2 are different fusions of water droplets, they\nare the same cloud. Call this cloud c. If\no1 is the same cloud as o2,\nthen presumably they have the same properties. But\no1 has the property of having w as a\npart, while o2 does not. Defenders of the relative\nidentity theory here deny the principle that if two objects are the\nsame F, they have the same properties. Many theorists find\nthis denial to amount to a reductio of the view.\n6. Partial Identity\n\nEven if o1 and o2 exist, and\nare clouds, and are not the same cloud, it does not immediately follow\nthat there are two clouds. If we analyze \u201cThere are two\nclouds\u201d as \u201cThere is an x and a y such\nthat x is a cloud and y is a cloud, and x\nis not the same cloud as y\u201d then the conclusion will\nnaturally follow. But perhaps that is not the correct analysis of\n\u201cThere are two clouds.\u201d Or, more cautiously, perhaps it is\nnot the correct analysis in all contexts. Following some suggestions\nof D. M. Armstrong\u2019s (Armstrong 1978, vol. 2: 37\u20138), David\nLewis suggests a solution along these lines. The objects\no1 and o2 are not the same\ncloud, but they are almost the same cloud. And in everyday\ncircumstances (AT) is a good-enough analysis of \u201cThere is one\ncloud\u201d\n\n(AT)\nThere is a cloud, and all clouds are almost identical\nwith it.\n\n\nAs Lewis puts it, we \u2018count by almost-identity\u2019 rather\nthan by identity in everyday contexts. And when we do, we get the\ncorrect result that there is one cloud in the sky. Lewis notes that\nthere are other contexts in which we count by some criteria other than\nidentity.\n\nIf an infirm man wishes to know how many roads he must cross to reach\nhis destination, I will count by identity-along-his-path rather than\nby identity. By crossing the Chester A. Arthur Parkway and Route 137\nat the brief stretch where they have merged, he can cross both by\ncrossing only one road. (Lewis 1976: 27)\n\n\nThere are two major objections to this theory. First, as Hudson notes,\neven if we normally count by almost-identity, we know how to count by\nidentity, and when we do it seems that there is one cloud in the sky,\nnot many millions. A defender of Lewis\u2019s position may say that\nthe only reason this seems intuitive is that it is normally intuitive\nto say that there is only one cloud in the sky. And that intuition is\nrespected! More contentiously, it may be argued that it is a\ngood thing to predict that when we count by identity we get\nthe result that there are millions of clouds. After all, the only time\nwe\u2019d do this is when we\u2019re doing metaphysics, and we have\nnoted that in the metaphysics classroom, there is some intuitive force\nto the argument that there are millions of clouds in the sky. It would\nbe a brave philosopher to endorse this as a virtue of the\ntheory, but it may offset some of the costs.\n\nSecondly, something like the Problem of the Many can arise even when\nthe possible objects are not almost identical. Lewis notes this\nobjection, and provides an illustrative example to back it up. A\nsimilar kind of example can be found in W. V. O. Quine\u2019s\nWord and Object (1960). Lewis\u2019s example is of a house\nwith an attached garage. It is unclear whether the garage is part of\nthe house or an external attachment to it. So it is unclear whether\nthe phrase \u2018Fred\u2019s house\u2019 denotes the basic house,\ncall it the home, or the fusion of the home and the garage. What is\nclear is that there is exactly one house here. However, the home might\nbe quite different from the fusion of the home and the garage. It will\nprobably be smaller and warmer, for example. So the home and the\nhome\u2013garage fusion are not even almost identical. Quine\u2019s\nexample is of something that looks, at first, to be a mountain with\ntwo peaks. On closer inspection we find that the peaks are not quite\nas connected as first appeared, and perhaps they could be properly\nconstrued as two separate mountains. What we could not say is that\nthere are three mountains here, the two peaks and their\nfusion, but since neither peak is almost identical to the other, or to\nthe fusion, this is what Lewis\u2019s solution implies.\n\nBut perhaps it is wrong to understand almost-identity in this way.\nConsider another example of Lewis\u2019s, one that Dan Lo\u0301pez de\nSa (2014) argues is central to a Lewisian solution to the problem.\n\nYou draw two diagonals in a square; you ask me how many triangles; I\nsay there are four; you deride me for ignoring the four large\ntriangles and counting only the small ones. But the joke is on you.\nFor I was within my rights as a speaker of ordinary language, and you\ncouldn\u2019t see it because you insisted on counting by strict\nidentity. I meant that, for some w, x, y,\nz, (1) w, x, y, and z are\ntriangles; (2) w and x are distinct, and \u2026 and so\nare y and z (six clauses); (3) for any triangle\nt, either t and w are not distinct, or \u2026\nor t and z are not distinct (four clauses). And by\n\u2018distinct\u2019 I meant non-overlap rather than non-identity,\nso what I said was true. (Lewis 1993, fn. 9)\n\n\nOne might think this is the general way to understand counting\nsentences in ordinary language. So There is exactly one F\ngets interpreted as There is an F, and no F is wholly distinct\nfrom it; and There are exactly two Fs gets interpreted\nas There are wholly distinct things x and y that are both F, and\nno F is wholly distinct from both of them, and so on. Lewis\nwrites as if this is an explication of the almost-identity proposal,\nbut this is at best misleading. A house with solar panels partially\noverlaps the city\u2019s electrical grid, but it would be very\nstrange to call them almost-identical. It sounds like a similar, but\ndistinct, proposed solution.\n\nHowever we understand the proposal, Lo\u0301pez de Sa notes that it\nhas a number of virtues. It seems to account for the puzzle involving\nthe house, what he calls the Problem of the Two. If in general\ncounting involves distinctness, then we have a good sense in which\nthere is one cloud in the sky, and Fred owns one house.\n\nThere still remain two challenges for this view. First, one could\nstill follow Hudson and argue that even if we ordinarily understand\ncounting sentences this way, we do still know how to count by\nidentity. And when we do, it seems that there is just one cloud, not\nmillions of them. Second, it isn\u2019t that clear that we always\ncount by distinctness, in the way L\u00f3pez de Sa suggests. If I\nsay there are three ways to get from my house to my office, I\ndon\u2019t mean to say that these three are completely distinct.\nIndeed, they probably all start with going out my door, down my\ndriveway etc., and end by walking up the stairs into my office. So the\ngeneral claim about how to understand counting sentences seems\nfalse.\n\nC. S. Sutton (2015) argued that we can get around something like the\nsecond of these problems if we do two things. First, the rule\nisn\u2019t that we don\u2019t normally quantify over things that\noverlap, just that we don\u2019t normally quantify over things that\nsubstantially overlap. We can look at a row of townhouses and say that\nthere are seven houses there even if the walls of the house overlap.\nSecond, the notion of overlap here is not sensitive to the quantity of\nmaterial that the objects have in common, but to their functional\nrole. If two objects play very different functional roles, she argues\nthat we will naturally count them as two, even if they have a lot of\nmaterial in common. This could account for a version of the getting to\nwork example where the three different ways of getting to work only\ndiffer on how to get through one small stretch in the middle. That is,\nif there are three (wholly distinct ways) to get from B to C, and the\nway to get from A to D is to go A-B-C-D, then there is a good sense in\nwhich there are three ways to get from A to D. Sutton\u2019s theory\nexplains how this could be true even if the B-C leg is a short part of\nthe trip.\n\nDavid Liebesman (2020) argued for a different way of implementing this\nkind of theory. He argues that the kinds of constraints that Lewis,\nL\u00f3pez de Sa and Sutton have suggested don\u2019t get\nincorporated into our theory of counting, but into the proper\ninterpretation of the nouns involved in counting sentences. It helps\nto understand Liebesman\u2019s idea with an example.\n\nThere is, we\u2019ll presumably all agree, just one colour in Yves\nKlein\u2019s\n Blue Monochrome.\n (It says so in the title.) But Blue Monochrome has blue in\nit, and it has ultramarine in it, and blue doesn\u2019t equal\nultramarine. What\u2019s gone on? Well, says Liebesman, whenever a\nnoun occurs under a determiner, it needs an interpretation. That\ninterpretation will almost never be maximal. When we ask how many\nanimals a person has in their house, we typically don\u2019t mean to\ncount the insects. When we say every book is on the shelf, we\ndon\u2019t mean every book in the universe. And typically, the\nrelevant interpretation of the determiner phrase (like \u2018every\nbook\u2019, or \u2018one cloud\u2019) will exclude overlapping\nobjects. Typically but not, says Liebesman, always. We can say, for\ninstance, that every shade of a colour is a colour, and in that\nsentence \u2018colour\u2019 includes both blue and ultramarine.\n\nThis offers a new solution to the Problem of the Many. He argues that\nall of 0 to 7 are true, but they are true for different\ninterpretations of phrases including the word \u2018cloud\u2019.\nWhen we interpret it in a way that rules out overlap, then 6 is false.\nWhen we interpret it in the maximal way, like the way we interpret\n\u2018colour\u2019 in Every shade of a colour is a colour,\nthen 2 is false. But to get the inconsistency, we have to equivocate.\nIt\u2019s an easy equivocation to make, since each of the meanings is\none that we frequently use.\n7. Vagueness\n\nStep 6 in the initial setup of the problem says that if any of the\noi is a cloud, then they all are. There are three\nimportant arguments for this premise, two of them presented explicitly\nby Unger, and the other by Geach. Two of the arguments seem to be\nfaulty, and the third can be rejected if we adopt some familiar,\nthough by no means universally endorsed, theories of vagueness.\n7.1 Argument from Duplication\n\nThe first argument, due essentially to Geach, runs as follows.\nGeach\u2019s presentation did not involve clouds, but the principles\nare clearly stated in his version of the argument. (The argument shows\nthat if an ok is a cloud for arbitrary k,\nwe can easily generalize to the claim that for every i,\noi is a cloud.)\n\n\nD1.\nIf all the water droplets not in sk did not\nexist, then ok would be a cloud.\nD2.\nWhether ok is a cloud does not depend on\nwhether things distinct from it exist.\nC.\nok is a cloud.\n\n\n\nD2 implies that being a cloud is an\n intrinsic\n property. The idea is that by changing the world outside the cloud,\nwe do not change whether or not it is a cloud. There is, however,\nlittle reason to believe this is true. And given that it leads to a\nrather implausible conclusion, that there are millions of clouds where\nwe think there is one, there is some reason to believe it is false. We\ncan argue directly for the same conclusion. Assume many more water\ndroplets coalesce around our original cloud. There is still one cloud\nin the sky, but it determinately includes more water droplets than the\noriginal cloud. The fusion of those water droplets exists, and we may\nassume that they did not change their intrinsic properties, but they\nare now a part of a cloud, rather than a cloud. Even if\nsomething looks like a cloud, smells like a cloud and rains like a\ncloud, it need not be a cloud, it may only be a part of a cloud.\n7.2 Argument from Similarity\n\nUnger\u2019s primary argument takes a quite different tack.\n\n\nS1.\nFor some j, oj is a typical\ncloud.\nS2.\nAnything that differs minutely from a typical cloud is a\ncloud.\nS3.\nok differs minutely from\noj.\nC.\nok is a cloud.\n\n\n\nSince we only care about the conditional if oj\nis a cloud, so is ok, it is clearly acceptable to\nassume that oj is a cloud for the sake of the\nargument. And S3 is guaranteed to be true by the setup of the problem.\nThe main issue then is whether S2 is true. As Hudson notes, there\nappear to be some clear counterexamples to it. The fusion of a cloud\nwith one of the water droplets in my bathtub is clearly not a cloud,\nbut by most standards it differs minutely from a cloud, since there is\nonly one droplet of water difference between them.\n7.3 Argument from Meaning\n\nThe final argument is not set out as clearly, but it has perhaps the\nmost persuasive force. Unger says that if exactly one of the\noi is a cloud, then there must be a\n\u2018selection principle\u2019 that picks it over the others. But\nit is not clear just what kind of selection principle that could be.\nThe underlying argument seems to be something like this:\n\n\nM1.\nFor some j, oj is a cloud.\nM2.\nIf oj is a cloud and the rest of the\noi are not, then some principle selects\noj to be the unique cloud.\nM3.\nThere is no principle that selects oj to be\nthe unique cloud.\nC.\nAt least one of the other oi is a cloud.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind M2 is that word meanings are not brute facts about\nreality. As Jerry Fodor put it, \u201cif aboutness is real, it must\nbe really something else\u201d (Fodor 1987: 97). Something makes it\nthe case that oj is the unique thing (around here)\nthat satisfies our term \u2018heap\u2019. Maybe that could be\nbecause oj has some unique properties that make it\nsuitable to be in the denotation of ordinary terms. Or maybe it is\nsomething about our linguistic practices. Or maybe it is some\ncombination of these things. But something must determine it, and\nwhatever it is, we can (in theory) say what that is, by giving some\nkind of principled explanation of why oj is the\nunique cloud.\n\nIt is at this point that theories of\n vagueness\n can play a role in the debate. Two of the leading theories of\nvagueness, epistemicism and supervaluationism, provide principled\nreasons to reject this argument. The epistemicist says that there are\nsemantic facts that are beyond our possible knowledge. Arguably we can\nonly know where a semantic boundary lies if that boundary was fixed by\nour use or by the fact that one particular property is a natural kind.\nBut, say the epistemicists, there are many other boundaries that are\nnot like this, such as the boundary between the heaps and the\nnon-heaps. Here we have a similar kind of situation. It is vague just\nwhich of the oi is a cloud. What that means is\nthat there is a fact about which of them is a cloud, but we cannot\npossibly know it. The epistemicist is naturally read as rejecting the\nvery last step in the previous paragraph. Even if something (probably\nour linguistic practices) makes it the case that\noj is the unique cloud, that need not be something\nwe can know and state.\n\nThe supervaluationist response is worth spending more time on here,\nboth because it engages directly with the intuitions behind this\nargument and because two of its leading proponents (Vann McGee and\nBrian McLaughlin, in their 2001) have responded directly to this\nargument using the supervaluationist framework. Roughly (and for more\ndetail see the section on supervaluations in the entry on\n vagueness)\n supervaluationists say that whenever some terms are vague, there are\nways of making them more precise consistent with our intuitions on how\nthe terms behave. So, to use a classic case, \u2018heap\u2019 is\nvague, which to the supervaluationist means that there are some piles\nof sand that are neither determinately heaps nor determinately\nnon-heaps, and a sentence saying that that object is a heap is neither\ndeterminately true nor determinately false. However, there are many\nways to extend the meaning of \u2018heap\u2019 so it\nbecomes precise. Each of these ways of making it precise is called a\nprecisification. A precisification is admissible iff\nevery sentence that is determinately true (false) in English is true\n(false) in the precisification. So if a is determinately a\nheap, b is determinately not a heap and c is neither\ndeterminately a heap nor determinately not a heap, then every\nprecisification must make \u2018a is a heap\u2019 true and\n\u2018b is a heap\u2019 false, but some make\n\u2018c is a heap\u2019 true and others make it false. To a\nfirst approximation, to be admissible a precisification must assign\nall the determinate heaps to the extension of \u2018heap\u2019 and\nassign none of the determinate non-heaps to its extension, but it is\nfree to assign or not assign things in the \u2018penumbra\u2019\nbetween these groups to the extension of \u2018heap\u2019. But this\nis not quite right. If d is a little larger than c,\nbut still not determinately a heap, then the sentence \u201cIf\nc is a heap so is d\u201d is intuitively true. As\nit is often put, following Kit Fine (1975), a precisification must\nrespect \u2018penumbral connections\u2019 between the borderline\ncases. If d has a better case for being a heap than\nc, then a precisification cannot make c a heap but\nnot d. These penumbral connections play a crucial role in the\nsupervaluationist solution to the Problem of the Many. Finally, a\nsentence is determinately true iff it is true on all admissible\nprecisifications, determinately false iff it is false on all\nadmissible precisifications.\n\nIn the original example, described by Lewis, the sentence \u201cThere\nis one cloud in the sky\u201d is determinately true. None of the\nsentences \u201co1 is a cloud\u201d,\n\u201co2 is a cloud\u201d and so on are\ndeterminately true. So a precisification can make each of these either\ntrue or false. But, if it is to preserve the fact that \u201cThere is\none cloud in the sky\u201d is determinately true, it must make\nexactly one of those sentences true. McGee and McLaughlin\nsuggest that this combination of constraints lets us preserve what is\nplausible about M2, without accepting that it is true. The term\n\u2018cloud\u2019 is vague; there is no fact of the matter as to\nwhether its extension includes o1 or\no2 or o3 or \u2026. If there\nwere such a fact, there would have to be something that made it the\ncase that it included oj and not\nok, and as M3 correctly points out, no such facts\nexist. But this is consistent with saying that its extension does\ncontain exactly one of the oi. The beauty of the\nsupervaluationist solution is that it lets us hold these seemingly\ncontradictory positions simultaneously. We also get to capture some of\nthe plausibility of S2\u2014it is consistent with the\nsupervaluationist position to say that anything similar to a cloud is\nnot determinately not a cloud.\n\nPenumbral connections also let us explain some other puzzling\nsituations. Imagine I point cloudwards and say, \u201cThat is a\ncloud.\u201d Intuitively, what I have said is true, even though\n\u2018cloud\u2019 is vague, and so is my demonstrative\n\u2018that\u2019. (To see this, note that there\u2019s no\ndeterminate answer as to which of the oi it picks\nout.) On different precisifications, \u2018that\u2019 picks out\ndifferent oi. But on every precisification it\npicks out the oi that is in the extension of\n\u2018cloud\u2019, so \u201cThat is a cloud\u201d comes out true\nas desired. Similarly, if I named the cloud \u2018Edgar\u2019, then\na similar trick lets it be true that \u201cEdgar\u201d is vague,\nwhile \u201cEdgar is a cloud\u201d is determinately true. So the\nsupervaluationist solution lets us preserve many of the intuitions\nabout the original case, including the intuitions that seemed to\nunderwrite M2, without conceding that there are millions of clouds.\nBut there are a few objections to this package.\n\nObjection: There are many telling objections to\nsupervaluationist theories of vagueness.\n\n\n\n\nReply: This may be true, but it would take us well beyond the\nscope of this entry to outline them all. See the entries on\n vagueness\n (the section on supervaluation) and the\n Sorites Paradox\n for more detail. \n \nObjection: The supervaluationist solution makes some\nexistentially quantified sentences, like \u201cThere is a cloud in\nthe sky\u201d determinately true even though no instance of them is\ndeterminately true.\n\n\n\n\nReply: As Lewis says, this is odd, but no odder than things\nthat we learn to live with in other contexts. Lewis compares this to\n\u201cI owe you a horse, but there is no particular horse that I owe\nyou.\u201d \n \nObjection: The penumbral connections here are not\nprecisely specified. What is the rule that says how much overlap is\nrequired before two objects cannot both be clouds?\n\n\n\n\nReply: It is true that the connections are not precisely\nspecified. It would be quite hard to carefully analyze\n\u2018cloud\u2019 to work out exactly what they are. But that we\ncannot say exactly what the rules are is no reason for saying no such\nrules exist, any more than our inability to say exactly what knowledge\nis provides a reason for saying that no one ever knows anything.\nScepticism can\u2019t be proven that easily. \n \nObjection: The penumbral connections appealed to here are\nleft unexplained. At a crucial stage in the explanation, it seems to\nbe just assumed that the problem can be solved, and that it is a\ndeterminate truth that there is one cloud in the sky.\n\n\n\n\nReply 1: We have to start somewhere in philosophy. This kind\nof reply can be spelled out in two ways. There is a\n\u2018Moorean\u2019 move that says that the premise that there is\none cloud in the sky is more plausible than the premises that would\nhave to be used in an argument against supervaluationism.\nAlternatively, it might be claimed that the main argument for\nsupervaluationism is an inference to the best explanation. In that\ncase, the intuition that there is exactly one cloud in the sky, but it\nis indeterminate just which object it is, is something to be\nexplained, not something that has to be proven. This is the\nkind of position defended by Rosanna Keefe in her book Theories of\nVagueness. Although Keefe does not apply this directly\nto the Problem of the Many, the way to apply her position to the\nProblem seems clear enough. \n\n\nReply 2: The penumbral connections we find for most words are\ngenerated by the inferential role provided by the meaning of the\nterms. It is because the inference from \u201cThis pile of sand is a\nheap\u201d, and \u201cThat pile of sand is slightly larger than this\none, and arranged roughly the same way,\u201d to \u201cThat pile of\nsand is a heap\u201d is generally acceptable that precisifications\nwhich make the premises true and the conclusions false are\ninadmissible. (We have to restrict this inferential rule to the case\nwhere \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 are ordinary\ndemonstratives, and not used to pick out arbitrary fusions of grains,\nor else we get bizarre results for reasons that should be familiar by\nthis point in the story.) And it isn\u2019t too hard to specify the\ninferential rule here. The inference from\n\u201coj is a cloud\u201d and\n\u201coj and ok massively\noverlap\u201d to \u201cok is a cloud\u201d is\njust as acceptable as the above inference involving heaps. Indeed, it\nis part of the meaning of \u2018cloud\u2019 that this inference is\nacceptable. (Much of this reply is drawn from the discussion of\n\u2018maximal\u2019 predicates in Sider 2001 and 2003, though since\nSider is no supervaluationist, he would not entirely endorse this way\nof putting things.) \n \nObjection: The second reply cannot explain the existence\nof penumbral connections between \u2018cloud\u2019 and\ndemonstratives like \u2018that\u2019 and names like\n\u2018Edgar\u2019. It would only explain the existence of those\npenumbral connections if it was part of the meaning of names and\ndemonstratives that they fill some kind of inferential role. But this\nis inconsistent with the widely held view that demonstratives and\nnames are\n directly referential.\n (For more details on debates about the meanings of names, see the\nentries on\n propositional attitude reports\n and\n singular propositions.)\n \n\n\n\nReply: One response to this would be to deny the view that\nnames and demonstratives are directly referential. Another would be to\ndeny that inferential roles provide the only penumbral\nconstraints on precisifications. Weatherson 2003b sketches a theory\nthat does exactly this. The theory draws on David Lewis\u2019s\nresponse to some quite different work on semantic indeterminacy. As\nmany authors (Quine 1960, Putnam 1981, Kripke 1982) showed, the\ndispositions of speakers to use terms are not fine-grained enough to\nmake the language as precise as we ordinarily think it is. As far as\nour usage dispositions go, \u2018rabbit\u2019 could mean undetached\nrabbit part, \u2018vat\u2019 could mean vat image, and\n\u2018plus\u2019 could mean quus. (Quus is a function defined over\npairs of numbers that yields the sum of the two numbers when they are\nboth small, and 5 when one is sufficiently large.) But intuitively our\nlanguage is not that indeterminate: \u2018plus\u2019 determinately\ndoes not mean quus.\n\nLewis (1983, 1984) suggested the way out here is to posit a notion of\n\u2018naturalness\u2019. Sometimes a term t denotes the\nconcept C1 rather than C2 not\nbecause we are disposed to use t as if it meant\nC1 rather than C2, but simply\nbecause C1 is a more natural concept.\n\u2018Plus\u2019 means plus rather than quus simply because plus is\nmore natural than quus. Something like the same story applies to names\nand demonstratives. Imagine I point in the direction of Tibbles the\ncat and say, \u201cThat is Edgar\u2019s favourite cat.\u201d There\nis a way of systematically (mis)interpreting all my utterances so\n\u2018that\u2019 denotes the Tibbles-shaped region of space-time\nexactly one metre behind Tibbles. (We have to reinterpret what\n\u2018cat\u2019 means to make this work, but the discussions of\nsemantic indeterminacy in Quine and Kripke make it clear how to do\nthis.) So there\u2019s nothing in my usage dispositions that makes\n\u2018that\u2019 mean Tibbles, rather than the region of space-time\nthat \u2018follows\u2019 him around. But because Tibbles is more\nnatural than that region of space-time, \u2018that\u2019 does pick\nout Tibbles. It is the very same naturalness that makes\n\u2018cat\u2019 denote a property that Tibbles (and not the trailing\nregion of space-time) satisfies that makes \u2018that\u2019 denote\nTibbles, a fact that will become important below.\n\nThe same kind of story can be applied to the cloud. It is because the\ncloud is a more natural object than the region of space-time a mile\nabove the cloud that our demonstrative \u2018that\u2019 denotes the\ncloud and not the region. However, none of the oi\nare more natural than any other, so there is still no fact of the\nmatter as to whether \u2018that\u2019 picks out\noj or ok. Lewis\u2019s theory\ndoes not eliminate all semantic indeterminacy; when there are equally\nnatural candidates to be the denotation of a term, and each of them is\nconsistent with our dispositions to use the term, then the denotation\nof the term is simply indeterminate between those candidates.\n\nWeatherson\u2019s theory is that the role of each precisification is\nto arbitrarily make one of the oi more natural\nthan the rest. Typically, it is thought that the denotation of a term\naccording to a precisification is determined directly. It is a fact\nabout a precisification P that, according to it,\n\u2018cloud\u2019 denotes property c1. On\nWeatherson\u2019s theory this is not the case. What the\nprecisification does is provide a new, and somewhat arbitrary,\nstandard of naturalness, and the content of the terms according to the\nprecisification is then determined by Lewis\u2019s theory of content.\nThe denotations of \u2018cloud\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019\naccording to a precisification P are those concepts and\nobjects that are the most natural-according-to-P of the\nconcepts and objects that we could be denoting by those terms, for all\none can tell from the way the terms are used. The coordination between\nthe two terms, the fact that on every precisification\n\u2018that\u2019 denotes an object in the extension of\n\u2018cloud\u2019 is explained by the fact that the very same thing,\nnaturalness-according-to-P, determines the denotation of\n\u2018cloud\u2019 and of \u2018that\u2019. \n \nObjection (From Stephen Schiffer 1998): The\nsupervaluationist account cannot handle speech reports involving vague\nnames. Imagine that Alex points cloudwards and says, \u201cThat is a\ncloud.\u201d Later Sam points towards the same cloud and says,\n\u201cAlex said that that is a cloud.\u201d Intuitively, Sam\u2019s\nutterance is determinately true. But according to the\nsupervaluationist, it is only determinately true if it is true on\nevery precisification. So it must be true that Alex said that\no1 is a cloud, that Alex said that\no2 is a cloud, and so on, since these are all\nprecisifications of \u201cAlex said that that is a cloud.\u201d But\nAlex did not say all of those things, for if she did she would be\ncommitted to saying that there are millions of clouds in the sky, and\nof course she is not, as the supervaluationists have been arguing.\n\n\n\n\nReply: There is a little logical slip here. Let\nPi be a precisification of Sam\u2019s word\n\u2018that\u2019 that makes it denote oi. All\nthe supervaluationist who holds that Sam\u2019s utterance is\ndeterminately true is committed to is that for each i,\naccording to Pi, Alex said that\noi is a cloud. And this will be true if the\ndenotation of Alex\u2019s word \u2018that\u2019 is also\noi according to Pi. So as long\nas there is a penumbral connection between Sam\u2019s word\n\u2018that\u2019 and Alex\u2019s word \u2018that\u2019, the\nsupervaluationist avoids the objection. Such a connection may seem\nmysterious at first, but note that Weatherson\u2019s theory predicts\nthat just such a penumbral connection obtains. So if that theory is\nacceptable, then Schiffer\u2019s objection misfires. \n \nObjection (From Neil Mackinnon 2002 and Thomas Sattig\n2013): It is part of our notion of a mountain that facts about\nmountain-hood are not basic. If something is a mountain, there are\nfacts in virtue of which it is a mountain, and nearby things are not.\nYet on each precisification of \u2018mountain\u2019, this\nwon\u2019t be true; it will be completely arbitrary which fusion of\nrocks is a mountain.\n\n\n\n\nReply: It is true that on any precisification there will be\nno principled reason why this fusion of rocks is a mountain, and\nanother is not. And it is true that there should be such a principled\nreason; mountainhood facts are not basic. But that problem can be\navoided by the theory that denies that \u201cthe supervaluationist\nrule [applies] to any statement whatever, never mind that the\nstatement makes no sense that way\u201d (Lewis 1993, 173).\nLewis\u2019s idea, or at least the application of Lewis\u2019s idea\nto this puzzle, is that we know how to understand the idea that\nmountainhood facts are non-arbitrary: we understand it as a claim that\nthere is some non-arbitrary explanation of which precisifications of\n\u2018mountain\u2019 are and are not admissible. If we must apply\nthe supervaluationist rule to every statement, including the statement\nthat it is not arbitrary which things are mountains, this\nunderstanding is ruled out. Lewis\u2019s response is to deny that the\nrule must always be applied. As long as there is some sensible way to\nunderstand the claim, we don\u2019t have to insist on applying the\nsupervaluationist machinery to it.\n\nThat said, it does seem like this is likely to be somewhat of a\nproblem for everyone (even the theorist like Lewis who uses the\nsupervaluationist machinery only when it is helpful). Sattig himself\nclaims to avoid the problem by making the mountain be a maximal fusion\nof candidates. But for any plausible mountain, it will be vague and\nsomewhat arbitrary what the boundary is between being a\nmountain-candidate and not being one. The lower boundaries of\nmountains are not, in practice, clearly marked. Similarly, there will\nbe some arbitrariness in the boundaries between the admissible and\ninadmissible precisifications of \u2018mountain\u2019. We may have\nto live with some arbitrariness. \n \nObjection (From J. Robert G. Williams 2006): When we look\nat an ordinary mountain, there definitely is (at least) one mountain\nin front of us. That seems clear. The vagueness solution respects this\nfact. But in many contexts, people tend to systematically confuse\n\u201cDefinitely, there is an F\u201d with \u201cThere is\na definite F.\u201d Indeed, the standard explanation of why\nSorites arguments seem, mistakenly, to be attractive is that this\nconfusion gets made. Yet on the vagueness account, there is no\ndefinite mountain; all the candidates are borderline cases. So by\nparity of reasoning, we should expect intuition to deny that there is\ndefinitely a mountain. And intuition does not deny that, it loudly\nconfirms it. At the very least, this shows a tension between the\nstandard account of the Sorites paradox, and the vagueness solution to\nthe Problem of the Many.\n\n\n\n\nReply: This is definitely a problem for the views that many\nphilosophers have put forward. As Williams stresses, it isn\u2019t on\nits own a problem for the vagueness solution to the Problem of the\nMany, but it is a problem for the conjunction of that solution with a\nwidely endorsed, and independently plausible, explanation of the\nSorites paradox. In his dissertation, Nicholas K. Jones (2010) argues\nthat the right response is to give up the idea that speakers typically\nconfuse \u201cDefinitely, there is an F\u201d with\n\u201cThere is a definite F\u201d, and instead use a\ndifferent resolution of the Sorites. \n \n\n\nSpace prevents a further discussion of all possible objections to the\nsupervaluationist account, but interested readers are particularly\nencouraged to look at Neil McKinnon\u2019s objection to the account\n(see the Other Internet Resources section), which suggests that\ndistinctive problems arise for the supervaluationist when there really\nare two or more clouds involved.\n\nEven if the supervaluationist solution to the Problem of the Many has\nresponses to all of the objections that have been levelled against it,\nsome of those objections rely on theories that are contentious and/or\nunderdeveloped. So it is far from clear at this stage how well the\nsupervaluationist solution, or indeed any solution based on vagueness,\nto the Problem of the Many will do in future years.\n8. Rethinking Parthood\n\nSome theorists have argued that the underlying cause of the problem is\nthat we have the wrong theory about the relation between parts and\nwholes. Peter van Inwagen (1990) argues that the problem is that we\nhave assumed that the parthood relation is determinate. We have\nassumed that it is always determinately true or determinately false\nthat one object is a part of another. According to van Inwagen,\nsometimes neither of these options applies. He thinks that we need to\nadopt some kind of\n fuzzy logic\n when we are discussing parts and wholes. It can be true to degree\n0.7, for example, that one object is part of another. Given these\nresources, van Inwagen says, we are free to conclude that there is\nexactly one cloud in the sky, and that some of the \u2018outer\u2019\nwater droplets are part of it to a degree strictly between 0 and 1.\nThis lets us keep the intuition that it is indeterminate whether these\noutlying water droplets are members of the cloud without accepting\nthat there are millions of clouds. Note that this is not what van\nInwagen would say about this version of the paradox, since he\nholds that some simples only constitute an object when that object is\nalive. For van Inwagen, as for Unger, there are no clouds, only\ncloud-like swarms of atoms. But van Inwagen recognises that a similar\nproblem arises for cats, or for people, two kinds of things that he\ndoes believe exist, and he wields this vague constitution theory to\nsolve the problems that arise there.\n\nTraditionally, many philosophers thought that such a solution was\ndownright incoherent. A tradition stretching back to Bertrand Russell\n(1923) and Michael Dummett (1975) held that vagueness was always and\neverywhere a representational phenomenon. From this perspective, it\ndidn\u2019t make sense to talk about it being vague or indeterminate\nwhether a particular droplet was part of a particular cloud. But this\ntraditional view has come under a lot of pressure in recent years; see\nBarnes (2010) for one of the best challenges, and Sorensen (2013,\nsection 8) for a survey of more work. So let us assume here it is\nlegitimate to talk about the possibility that parthood itself, and not\njust our representation of it, is vague. As Hudson (2001) notes\nthough, it is far from clear just how the appeal to fuzzy logic is\nmeant to help here. Originally it was clear for each of\nn water droplets whether they were members of the cloud to\ndegree 1 or degree 0. So there were 2n candidate\nclouds, and the Problem of the Many is finding out how to preserve the\nintuition when faced with all these objects. It is unclear how\nincreasing the range of possible relationships between each\nparticle and the cloud from 2 to continuum-many should help here, for\nnow it seems there are at least continuum-many cloud-like objects to\nchoose between, one for each function from each of the n\ndroplets to [0, 1], and we need a way of saying exactly one of them is\na cloud. Assume that some droplet is part of the cloud to degree 0.7.\nNow consider the object (or perhaps possible object) that is just like\nthe cloud, except this droplet is only part of it to degree 0.6. Does\nthat object exist, and is it a cloud? Van Inwagen says, in a way\nreminiscent of Markosian\u2019s brutal composition solution, that\nsuch an \u2018object\u2019 does not even exist. \n\nA different kind of solution is offered by Mark Johnston (1992) and E.\nJ. Lowe (1982, 1995). Both of them suggest that the key to solving the\nProblem is to distinguish cloud-constituters from clouds. They say it\nis a category mistake to identify clouds with any fusion of water\ndroplets, because they have different identity conditions. The cloud\ncould survive the transformation of half its droplets into puddles on\nthe footpath (or whatever kind of land it happens to be raining over),\nit would just be a smaller cloud, the fusion could not. As Johnston\nsays, \u201cHence Unger\u2019s insistent and ironic question\n\u2018But which of o1, o2,\no3, \u2026 is our paradigm cloud\nc?\u2019 has as its proper answer \u2018None\u2019\u201d\n(1992: 100, numbering slightly altered).\n\nLewis (1993) listed several objections to this position, and Lowe\n(1995) responds to them. (Lewis and Lowe discuss a version of the\nproblem using cats not clouds, and we will sometimes follow them\nbelow.)\n\nLewis\u2019s first objection is that positing clouds as well as\ncloud-constituting fusions of atoms is metaphysically extravagant. As\nLowe (and, for separate reasons, Johnston) point out, these extra\nobjects are arguably needed to solve puzzles to do with persistence.\nHence it is no objection to a solution to the Problem of the Many that\nit posits such objects. Resolving these debates would take us too far\nafield, so let us assume (as Lewis does) that we have reason to\nbelieve that these objects exist.\n\nSecondly, Lewis says that even with this move, we still have a Problem\nof the Many applied to cloud-constituters, rather than to clouds. Lowe\nresponds that since \u2018cloud-constituter\u2019 is not a folk\nconcept, we don\u2019t really have any philosophically salient\nintuitions here, so this cannot be a way in which the position is\nunintuitive.\n\nFinally, Lewis says that each of the constituters is so like the\nobject it is meant to merely constitute (be it a cloud, or a cat, or\nwhatever), it satisfies the same sortals as that object. So if we were\noriginally worried that there were 1001 cats (or clouds) where we\nthought there was one, now we should be worried that there are 1002.\nBut as Lowe points out, this argument seems to assume that being a\ncat, or being a cloud, is an intrinsic property. If we\nassume that it is extrinsic, if it turns on the history of the object,\nperhaps its future or its possible future, and on which object it is\nembedded in, then the fact that a cloud-constituter looks, when\nconsidered in isolation, to be a cloud is little reason to think it\nactually is a cloud.\n\nJohnston provides an argument that the distinction between clouds and\ncloud-constituting fusions of water droplets is crucial to solving the\nProblem. He thinks that the following principle is sound, and not\nthreatened by examples like our cloud.\n\n(9\u2032) If y is a paradigm F, and x is\nan entity that differs from y in any respect relevant to\nbeing an F only very minutely, and x is of the right\ncategory, i.e. is not a mere quantity or piece of matter, then\nx is an F. (Johnston 1992: 100)\n\n\nThe theorist who thinks that clouds are just fusions of water droplets\ncannot accept this principle, or they will conclude that every\noi is a cloud, since for them each\noi is of the right category. On the other hand,\nJohnston himself cannot accept it either, unless he denies there can\nbe another object c\u2032 which is in a similar position to\nc, and is of the same category as c, but differs\nwith respect to which water droplets constitute it. It seems that what\nis doing the work in Johnston\u2019s solution is not just the\ndistinction between constitution and identity, but a tacit restriction\non when there is a \u2018higher-level\u2019 object constituted by\ncertain \u2018lower-level\u2019 objects. To that extent, his theory\nalso resembles Markosian\u2019s brutal composition theory, though\nsince Johnston can accept that every set of atoms has a fusion his\ntheory has different costs and benefits to Markosian\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nA recent version of this kind of view comes from Nicholas K. Jones\n(2015), though he focusses on constitution, not composition. (Indeed,\na distinctive aspect of his view is that he takes constitution to be\nmetaphysically prior to composition.) Jones rejects the following\nprinciple, which is similar to 4 in the original inconsistent set.\n\nIf the water droplets in si constitute\noi, and the objects in sj\nconstitute oj, and the sets si\nand sk are not identical, then the objects\noi and oj are not\nidentical.\n\n\nHe rejects this claim. He argues that some water droplets can\nconstitute a cloud, and some other water droplets can constitute the\nvery same cloud. On this view, the predicate constitute x\nbehaves a bit like the predicate surround the building. It\ncan be true that the Fs surround the building, and the Gs surround the\nbuilding, without the Fs being the Gs. And on Jones\u2019s view, it\ncan be true that the Fs constitute x, and the Gs constitute\nx, without the Fs being the Gs. This resembles Lewis\u2019s\nsolution in terms of almost-identity, since both Jones and Lewis say\nthat there is one cloud, yet both si and\nsk can be said to compose it. But for Lewis, this\nis possible because he rejects the inference from There is one\ncloud, to If a and b are clouds, they are identical.\nJones accepts this inference, and rejects the inference from the\npremise that si and sk are\ndistinct, and each compose a cloud, to the conclusion that they\ncompose non-identical clouds. \n9. Rethinking Parthood\n\nAfter concluding that all of these kinds of solutions face serious\ndifficulties, Hudson (2001: Chapter 2) outlines a new solution, one\nwhich rejects so many of the presuppositions of the puzzle that it is\nbest to count him as rejecting the reasoning, rather than rejecting\nany particular premise. (Hudson is somewhat tentative about\nendorsing this view, as opposed to merely endorsing the claim\nthat it looks better than its many rivals, but for expository purposes\nlet us refer to it here as his view.) To see the motivation behind\nHudson\u2019s approach, consider a slightly different case, a variant\nof one discussed in Wiggins 1968. Tibbles is born at midnight Sunday,\nreplete with a splendid tail, called Tail. An unfortunate accident\ninvolving a guillotine sees Tibbles lose his tail at midday Monday,\nthough the tail is preserved for posterity. Then midnight Monday,\nTibbles dies. Now consider the timeless question, \u201cIs Tail part\nof Tibbles?\u201d Intuitively, we want to say the question is\nunderspecified. Outside of Monday, the question does not arise, for\nTibbles does not exist. Before midday Monday, the answer is\n\u201cYes\u201d, and after midday the answer is \u201cNo\u201d.\nThis suggests that there is really no proposition that Tail is part of\nTibbles. There is a proposition that Tail is part of Tibbles on Monday\nmorning (that\u2019s true) and that Tail is part of Tibbles on Monday\nafternoon (that\u2019s false), but no proposition involving just the\nparthood relation and two objects. Parthood is a three-place relation\nbetween two objects and a time, not a two-place relation between two\nobjects.\n\nHudson suggests that this line of reasoning is potentially on the\nright track, but that the conclusion is not quite right. Parthood is a\nthree-place relation, but the third place is not filled by a time, but\nby a region of space-time. To a crude approximation, x is\npart of y at s is true if (as we\u2019d normally\nsay) x is a part of y and s is a region of\nspace-time containing no region not occupied by y and all\nregions occupied by x. But this should be taken as a\nheuristic guide only, not as a reductive definition, since parthood is\nreally a three-place relation, so the crude approximation does not\neven express a proposition according to Hudson.\n\nTo see how this applies to the Problem of the Many, let\u2019s\nsimplify the case a little bit so there are only two water droplets,\nw1 and w2, that are neither\ndeterminately part of the cloud nor determinately not a part of it. As\nwell there is the core of the cloud, call it a. On an\northodox theory, there are four proto-clouds here, a,\na + w1, a +\nw2 and a + w1 +\nw 2. On Hudson\u2019s theory the largest and the\nsmallest proto-clouds still exist, but in the middle there is a quite\ndifferent kind of object, which we\u2019ll call c. Let\nr1 be the region occupied by a and\nw1, and r2 the region occupied\nby a and w2. Then the following claims\nare all true according to Hudson:\n\nc exactly occupies r1;\nc exactly occupies r2;\nc does not occupy the region consisting of the union of\nr1 and r2;\nc has w1 as a part at\nr1, but not at r2;\nc has w2 as a part at\nr2, but not at r1;\nc has no parts at the region consisting of the union of\nr1 and r2.\n\n\nHudson defines \u201cx exactly occupies s\u201d as\nfollows:\n\nx has a part at s,\nthere is no region of space-time, s*, such that\ns* has s as a subregion, while x has a part\nat s*, and\nfor every subregion of s, s\u2032, x\nhas a part at s\u2032. (Hudson 2001: 63)\n\n\nAt first, it might look like not much has been accomplished here. All\nthat we did was turn a Problem of 4 clouds into a Problem of 3 clouds,\nreplacing the fusions a + w1 and\na + w2 with the new, and oddly behaved,\nc. But that is to overlook a rather important feature of the\nremaining proto-clouds. The three remaining proto-clouds can be\nstrictly ordered by the \u2018part of\u2019 relation. This was not\npreviously possible, since neither a + w1\nnor a + w2 were part of the other. If we\nadopt the principle that \u2018cloud\u2019 is a maximal predicate,\nso no cloud can be a proper part of another cloud, we now get the\nconclusion that exactly one of the proto-clouds is a cloud, as\ndesired.\n\nThis is a quite ingenious approach, and it deserves some attention in\nthe future literature. It is hard to say what will emerge as the main\ncosts and benefits of the view in advance of that literature, but the\nfollowing two points seem worthy of attention. First, if we are\nallowed to appeal to the principle that no cloud is a proper part of\nanother, why not appeal to the principle that no two clouds massively\noverlap, and get from 4 proto-clouds to one actual cloud that way?\nSecondly, why don\u2019t we have an object that is just like the old\na + w1, that is, an object that has\nw1 as a part at r1, and does\nnot have w2 (or anything else) as a part at\nr2? If we get it back, as well as a +\nw2, then all of Hudson\u2019s tinkering with\nmereology will just have converted a problem of 4 clouds into a\nproblem of 5 clouds.\n\nNeither of these points should be taken to be conclusive refutations.\nAs things stand now, Hudson\u2019s solution joins the ranks of the\nmany and varied proposed solutions to the Problem of the Many. For\nsuch a young problem, the variety of these solutions is rather\nimpressive. Whether the next few years will see these ranks whittled\ndown by refutation, or swelled by imaginative theorising, remains to\nbe seen.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Armstrong, D.
