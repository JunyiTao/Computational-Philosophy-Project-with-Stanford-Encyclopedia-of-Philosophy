    "main_text": "Human Evolution and the Descent of Man || The Ethical Theory of the Descent of Man\n4.3 The Ethical Theory of the Descent of Man\n\nThe many dimensions of \u201csocial\u201d Darwinism that were\naffected by the Descent demand separate articles, as does the\nseparate impact of the Expression of the Emotions, a treatise\nthat in many respects is different in tone and content from the\nDescent. It is also the case that many of the social\nimplications of evolutionary theory were due more to the influence of\nHerbert Spencer than to Darwin\u2019s own writings, and for this\nreason what has been termed \u201csocial Darwinism\u201d may have\ndeveloped independently of Darwin (Bowler 2013b). In this closing\nsubsection the author will focus exclusively on one important aspect\nof this broader social impact of the Descent, the Darwinian\ntreatment of ethics. This will be examined within its specific\nVictorian context, rather than in light of more recent discussions of\naltruism within contemporary sociobiology that may owe some filiation\nwith these Darwinian discussion (see entries on\n morality and evolutionary biology\n and\n biological altruism).\n\nAs can be seen from the letter to Asa Gray of March 1870 (Burkhardt et\nal. 2010 18: 68) , Darwin was\nparticularly exercised by the issue of ethics in preparing the\nDescent. His published treatment focused the long chapter\nthree of the Descent on the issue of the \u201cmoral\nsense\u201d. In approaching ethics \u201cexclusively from the side\nof natural history\u201d (Descent 1871: vol 1: 71), he\noffered some innovations that do not easily map on to standard ethical\npositions formulated around the familiar categories of Utilitarianism\nand the Kantian heritage of Deontology. The closest connections might\nbe drawn with certain aspects of contemporary virtue ethics and some\naspects of Natural Law theory, although there are many specific\ndifferences that prevent assimilation to these traditions as well\n(Sloan 1999). His closest historical affinities are with the Scottish\nmoral sense tradition of Adam Smith, David Hume, and particularly as\nthis was developed in the writings of Darwin\u2019s distant relative,\nSir James Macintosh (1765\u20131832) (R.J. Richards\n1987, 1999, 2003,\n.\n\nTraditional moral sense theory linked ethical behavior to an innate\nproperty or instinct that was considered universal in human beings,\neven though it required education and cultivation to reach its highest\nexpression (see\n moral sentimentalism\n in this encyclopedia). This inherent property, or \u201cmoral\nsense\u201d, presumably explained such phenomena as ethical\nconscience, and it also accounted for altruistic actions that could\nnot be reduced to a hedonic seeking of pleasure and avoiding pain. It\nalso did not involve the rational calculation of advantage by the\nindividual prior to action.\n\nDarwin\u2019s reinterpretation of the moral sense tradition within\nhis evolutionary framework, however, implied important\ntransformations. The moral sense, for Darwin, was derived by\nbiological descent from animal instinct, and particularly from the\nsocial instincts developed by natural selection. From this\nperspective, Darwin could then argue for a genuine\n\u201chomology\u201d of ethical foundations holding between humans\nand animals, with the precursors of human ethical behavior found in\nthe behavior of other animals, particularly those with social\norganization. Natural and sexual selection then shaped these ethical\ninstincts in ways that favored group survival rather than immediate\nindividual benefit (Descent 1871: vol. 1: 98). Human ethical\nbehavior is therefore grounded in a natural property, and ethical\naction can occur without moral calculus or rational deliberation.\nBecause he considered ethical action to be grounded on a biologically\ninnate property, Darwin criticized John Stuart Mill\u2019s\nUtilitarian theory because it relied on acquired habits rather than\nsomething present in humans from the beginning (1871: vol. 1: 71n5).\nThe innate moral sense is his explanation for self-sacrifice and other\naltruistic acts that cannot be attributed to individual self-survival\n(1871: vol. 1: 86). Humans can be \n\n\nimpelled by the same instinctive motive, which made the heroic little\nAmerican monkey\u2026attack the great and dreaded baboon, to save\nhis keeper. (Descent 1871: vol. 1: 87)\n\n\nWhen moral conflict occurs, this is generally attributed to a conflict\nof instincts, with the stronger of two conflicting instincts favored\nby natural selection insofar as it favors group benefit\n(Descent 1871: vol. 1: 84). In human beings the \u201cmore\nenduring Social Instincts\u201d thus come to override the less\npersistent \u201cindividual\u201d instincts (1871: vol. 1: 87).\n\nThe adequacy of evolutionary ethical naturalism as a foundation for\nethical realism has been a point of contention for Darwin\u2019s\ncontemporaries and successors since the publication of the\nDescent. For some moral philosophers, Darwin had simply\nreduced ethics to a property subject to the relativizing tendencies of\nnatural selection (Farber 1994: chp. 5). It was, in the view of\nDarwin\u2019s philosophical critics, to reduce ethics to biology and\nin doing so, to offer no way to distinguish ethical goods from\nsurvival advantages. Not even for some strong supporters of Darwinism,\nsuch as Thomas Huxley and Alfred Russel Wallace, was Darwin\u2019s\naccount adequate (Farber 1994: chp. 4). Much of subsequent moral\nphilosophy was to be grounded upon the canonical acceptance of the\n\u201cis-ought\u201d distinction,  which developed from this critique of\n\u201cevolutionary\u201d ethical theory. Receiving its most\ninfluential expression in G. E. Moore \u2019s (1873\u20131958)\nPrincipia Ethica (1903)\u2014itself an attack on\nSpencer\u2019s version of evolutionary ethics\u2014, the debate over\nthe adequacy of evolutionary ethics has continued (Hauser 2006; Katz\n(ed.) 2000; Maienschein & Ruse (eds.) 1999).\n",
