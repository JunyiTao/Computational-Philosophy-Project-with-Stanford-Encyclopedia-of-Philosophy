    "main_text": "Emergentism || Broad\u2019s Knowledge Argument\n5.3 Broad\u2019s Knowledge Argument\n\nIn the last chapter of his book Broad presents a taxonomy of no less\nthan seventeen different theories which are \u201cpossible\ntheoretically on the relation between Mind and Matter\u201d (1925, p.\n607). By a process of elimination Broad arrives at a more wieldy\nnumber of theories. Two of the remaining rivalling theories are\nPhysicalism\u2014in Broad\u2019s terminology,\n\u201cMechanism\u201d\u2014and Emergentism. Let us now take a\ncloser look at his case for Emergentism.\n\nBroad adduces a version of what has come to be known as The\nKnowledge Argument in favour of an Emergentist position with\nrespect to the place of consciousness in nature. He asks us to assume\nthat there is a mathematical archangel. The archangel\u2019s\nmathematical and logical capability is unlimited; in addition he is\ngifted with the capacity to perceive \u201cthe microscopic structure\nof atoms as easily as we can perceive hay-stacks\u201d. Now would\nthere be any limit to the archangel\u2019s knowledge of the world?\nBroad\u2019s answer is Yes.\n\nTake any ordinary statement, such as we find in chemistry books; e.g,\n\u201cNitrogen and Hydrogen combine when an electric discharge is\npassed through the mixture of the two. The resulting compound contains\nthree atoms of Hydrogen to one of Nitrogen; it is a gas readily\nsoluble in water and possessed of a characteristic smell.\u201d If\nthe mechanistic theory be true the archangel could deduce from his\nknowledge of the microscopic structure of atoms all these fact but the\nlast. He would know exactly what the microscopic structure must be;\nbut he would be totally unable to predict that a substance with this\nstructure must smell as ammonia does when it gets into the human nose.\nThe utmost that he could predict on this subject would be that certain\nchanges would take place in the mucous membrane, the olfactory nerves\nand so on. But he could not possibly know that these changes would be\naccompanied by the appearance of a smell in general or of the peculiar\nsmell of ammonia in particular, unless someone told him so or he had\nsmelled it for himself. If the existence of the so-called\n\u201csecondary qualities,\u201d or the fact of their appearance,\ndepends on the microscopic movements and arrangements of material\nparticles which do not have these qualities themselves, then the law\nof this dependence are certainly of the emergent type. [1925, p.\n71\u20132]\n\n\nThe archangel knows all the physicalistic (mechanistic) truths. There\nare, however, some truths that he does not know. But if Physicalism\nwere true the archangel should know all truths. Physicalism\nis, therefore, false.\n\nIf sound, Broad\u2019s argument establishes the negative conclusion\nthat mental phenomena are distinct from neurophysiological processes.\nBy itself it does not establish the Emergentist position, since the\nconclusion is consistent with the truth of, say, Substance Dualism (or\nwhat Broad calls \u201cDualism of incompatibles\u201d).\nBroad\u2019s overall argumentation for Emergentism, however, also\nincludes a fairly thorough discussion that seeks to undermine various\nlines of argument to the effect that mental properties and physical\nproperties are incompatible, i.e. arguments to the effect\nthat a material whole such as a nervous system could not possibly have\nmental properties. These are arguments that, if successful, would rule\nout Emergentism (which is a form of property dualism) in favour of\nsubstance dualism. Broad\u2019s case for Emergentism, then, includes\nmore than his knowledge argument and the simple methodological point\nthat Emergentism is a more ontologically economical position than\nsubstance dualism.\n",
