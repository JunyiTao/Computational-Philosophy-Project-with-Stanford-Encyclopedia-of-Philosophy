    "main_text": "Science and Social Philosophy\n7. The Ethical Dimension in Bacon's Thought\n\n\nThe ethical dimension of Bacon's thought has been underrated\nby generations of scholars. Time and again a crude utilitarianism has\nbeen derived from Book I, Aphorism 1 of the Novum Organum;\nthis cannot, however, withstand a closer analysis of his thought. Since\nBacon's philosophy of science tries to answer the question of how\nman can overcome the deficiencies of earthly life resulting from the\nFall, he enters the realm of ethical reflection. The improvement of\nmankind's lot by means of philosophy and science does not start\nfrom a narrow utilitarian point of view, involving sheer striving for\nprofit and supporting the power or influence of select groups of men,\nbut instead emphasizes the construction of a better world for mankind,\nwhich might come into existence through the ascertaining of truths\nabout nature's workings (Bacon III [1887], 242). Thus, the\nperspective of the universal in Bacon's ethical thought is given\npredominance. The range of science and technology in their ethical\nmeaning transcends the realm of the application of tools and/or\ninstruments, in so far as the aim is the transformation of whole\nsystems. Since causality and finality can interact on the basis of\nhuman will and knowledge, a plurality of worlds becomes feasible\n(Bacon V [1889], 506\u20137). Moral philosophy is closely connected\nto ethical reflections on the relationship between the nature of\nvirtues\u2014habitual or innate?\u2014and their use in life,\nprivately and collectively. Any application of the principles of virtue\npresupposes for Bacon the education of the mind, so that we learn what\nis good and what should be attained (Gaukroger 2006, 204\u20135 and\npassim):\n\n\nThe main and primitive division of moral knowledge seemeth to\nbe into the Exemplar or Platform of Good, and the Regimen of Culture of\nthe Mind; the one describing the nature of good, the other prescribing\nrules how to subdue, apply, and accommodate the will of man\nthereunto (Bacon III [1887], 419).\n\n\n\nSo, already in his Advancement of Learning Bacon\nstudied the nature of good and distinguished various kinds of good. He\ninsisted on the individual's duty to the public. Private moral\nself-control and the concomitant obligations are relevant for behavior\nand action in society. One's ethical persona is\nconnected to morality by reference to acceptable behaviour. Though what\nwe can do may be limited, we have to muster our psychological powers\nand control our passions when dealing with ourselves and  with\nothers. We need to apply self-discipline and rational assessment, as\nwell as restraining our passions, in order to lead an active moral life\nin society.\n\n\nThus, for Bacon, the acquisition of knowledge does not simply\ncoincide with the possibility of exerting power. Scientific knowledge\nis a condition for the expansion and development of civilization.\nTherefore, knowledge and charity cannot be kept separate:\n\n\nI humbly pray \u2026 that knowledge being now discharged of\nthat venom which the serpent infused into it, and which makes the mind\nof man to swell, we may not be wise above measure and sobriety, but\ncultivate truth in charity\u2026. Lastly, I would address one general\nadmonition to all; that they consider what are the true ends of\nknowledge, and that they seek it not either for pleasure of the mind,\nor for contention, or for superiority to others, or for profit, or\nfame, or power, or any of these inferior things; but for the benefit\nand use of life; and that they perfect and govern it in charity. For it\nwas from the lust of power that the angels fell, from lust of knowledge\nthat man fell; but of charity there can be no excess, neither did angel\nor man ever come in danger by it (Bacon IV [1901], 20f.:\nInstauratio Magna, Preface).\n\n\n\nFinally, the view that Bacon's Nova Atlantis\n\u201cconcerns a utopian society that is carefully organized for the\npurposes of scientific research and virtuous living\u201d (Urbach\n1988, 10) holds true for his entire life's work. In Nova\nAtlantis, social, political, and scholarly life are all organized\naccording to the maxim of efficiency; but the House of Solomon is a\nseparate and highly esteemed institution for research, which\nnevertheless is closely connected to the overall system of Bensalem. In\nhis utopian state, Bacon presents a thoroughgoing collective life in\nsociety and science, both of which are based on revealed religion.\nReligion\u2014Christian in essence\u2014is not dogmatic, but it\ninstills into the people of Bensalem veneration for the wise and\nmorally exemplary members of society, and\u2014which is of the utmost\nimportance\u2014the strictest sense of discipline (Gaukroger 2001,\n128\u201330). Discipline is indispensable for those involved in the\nreligious life as well as for the researchers, since both must proceed\nmethodically. The isomorphic structures of nature and science, on the\none hand, society and religion, on the other, prescribe patterns of\npolitical procedure, social processes, and religious attitudes, which\novercome any craving for individuality. If religion and scientific\nresearch are both shown as truthful in Bensalem, then, according to\nBacon, the imagination functions as a means of illustrating scientific\nrevelation: \u201cBacon's purpose is \u2026 to show that\nscientific research properly pursued is not inconsonant with religious\npropriety and social stability\u2026\u201d (Bierman 1963, 497). The\nscientists in Bensalem are sacred searchers for truth: ethics,\nreligion, and science merge. Bacon's parabolic strategy, which we\nshould not separate from the power of the idols, enables him to make\nmuch of his trick of introducing new ideas like a smuggler: his colored\nwares are smuggled into the minds of his readers by being visualized in\nterms of sacred and highly symbolic rituals (Peltonen 1996, 175).\nScience and religion are separated in Nova Atlantis, but they are also\ninterrelated through the offices of the society of Bensalem. What Bacon\nobviously wants to make clear to his readers is that the example of\nBensalem should free them from any fear that scientific progress will\nlead to chaos and upheaval. This crucial point has made by J\u00fcrgen\nMittelstrass, who understands Bacon's Nova Atlantis as a\nutopia and regards utopias as \n\nblueprints of practical reason,\nnot of theoretical, that is: they set in exactly there, where the early\nmodern idea of progress  appears meagre with regards to the\ncontents: within ethics and political theory.
