    "main_text": "Multi-Modal Systems in Philosophical Discussions || Truthmakers from a modal perspective\n5.5 The Brandenburger-Keisler Paradox\n\nConsider the following situation (Brandenburger & Keisler 2006)\ninvolving two epistemic attitudes, belief and\nassumption. \n\n\nAnn believes that Bob assumes that \\(\\underbrace{\\textit{Ann\nbelieves that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong}.}_{\\varphi}\\) \n\n\nGiven this, the question is the following: is \\(\\varphi\\)\n(\u201cAnn believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is\nwrong\u201d) true or false?\n\nParaphrasing Pacuit and Roy\n (2017:Section 6),\n suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is true. So, what \\(\\varphi\\) represents is true,\nthat is, Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong. Moreover,\nby belief introspection, she believes that \u201cshe believes\nBob\u2019s assumption is wrong\u201d, that is, she believes\nBob\u2019s assumption. But the description of the situation tells us\nthat Ann believes that Bob assumes \\(\\varphi\\); then, in fact, Ann\nbelieves that Bob\u2019s assumption is correct. Thus, \\(\\varphi\\),\n\u201cAnn believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is\nwrong\u201d, is false.\n\nBut now suppose \\(\\varphi\\) is false. Then, following Pacuit and Roy\n (2017:Section 6)\n again, Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is correct, that is,\nAnn believes \\(\\varphi\\) is correct. Furthermore, the description of\nthe situation states that \u201cAnn believes that Bob assumes\nthat Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong\u201d,\nwhich, given that \\(\\varphi\\) is Bob\u2019s assumption, can be\nrewritten as \u201cAnn believes that Bob assumes that Ann\nbelieves that \\(\\varphi\\) is wrong\u201d. But then, not only Ann\nbelieves that she believes that \\(\\varphi\\) is correct; she also\nbelieves that Bob assumption is that she believes that \\(\\varphi\\) is\nwrong. Thus, it is the case that she believes Bob\u2019s assumption\nis wrong (Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is that she\nbelieves that \\(\\varphi\\) is wrong, but she believes that is wrong:\nshe believes that \\(\\varphi\\) is correct). So, \\(\\varphi\\) is\ntrue.\n\nThis paradox is interesting because it suggests that not every\ndescription of beliefs can be \u2018represented\u2019 (just as\n Russell\u2019s paradox\n suggests that not every collection can constitute a set). As\nexplained in Pacuit (2007), in order to show that this situation\ncannot be \u2018represented\u2019, the original paper (Brandenburger\n& Keisler 2006) introduces a belief model. This structure\nrepresents each agent\u2019s beliefs about the beliefs of the other\nagent. More precisely, a belief model is a two-sorted structure, one\nsort for each agent, with each sort representing an epistemic state\nthat its agent might have. The model\u2019s first component is its\ndomain, given by the union of \\(W_a\\) and \\(W_b\\), the disjoint sets\nof states of Ann and Bob, respectively. The model also has a relation\nfor each agent, \\(R_a\\) and \\(R_b\\), with \\(R_auv\\) (restricted to \\(u\n\\in W_a\\) and \\(v \\in W_b)\\) read as \u201cin state u, Ann\nconsiders v possible, and analogous for \\(R_bvu\\). Note\nhow each collection \\(\\cU_b\\) of subsets of \\(W_b\\) can be understood\nas a language for Ann (the beliefs she might have about Bob\u2019s\nbeliefs), and analogous for Bob. A full language is then defined as\nthe union of a language for each agent. The epistemic attitudes\nfeatured in the situation under discussion can be defined as follows.\nOn the one hand, beliefs have a somehow standard interpretation: Ann\nbelieves a given \\(U \\in \\U_b\\) if and only if the set of\nstates that she considers possible is a subset of \\(U\\). On\nthe other hand, an assumption is understood as the strongest belief:\nAnn assumesa given \\(U \\in \\U_b\\) if and only if the set of\nstates she considers possible is \\emph{exactly} \\(U\\).\n\nWith these tools, it is now possible to make precise the claim that\nthe situation described above cannot be represented. A language is\nsaid to be complete for a belief model if and only if every\npossible statement in a player\u2019s language (i.e., every statement\nin her language that is true in at least one state) can be assumed by\nthe player. It is then possible to show, using a diagonal argument,\nthat no belief model is complete for \u2018its first-order\nlanguage\u2019, i.e., the language containing all first-order\ndefinable subsets of the model\u2019s domain.\nClosing Words\n\nThe study of multi-modal logics and their applications is an on-going\nfield of study. While we have illustrated some of the main\ndevelopments in this area, many more combinations of modal operators\nhave emerged as tools for the formal analysis of different interesting\nphenomena, with many of them being still currently further explored.\nSome examples are related to \u2018old\u2019 questions. An instance\nis the famous logical omniscience problem (Hintikka 1962; Stalnaker\n1991), whose multi-modal discussion involves not only the concepts of\nimplicit and explicit knowledge/beliefs (e.g., Levesque 1984;\nLakemeyer 1986; Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada 2013; Lorini 2020) but also\nthe relationship between knowledge and awareness (see, e.g.,\nFagin and Halpern 1988; Halpern & R\u00eago 2009, van Benthem\n& Vel\u00e1zquez-Quesada 2010; Belardinelli & Schipper\n2023). Some other examples have emerged from new developments. An\ninstance is the combination of modal operators to reason about the\nflow of quantum information (Baltag and Smets 2022). A very fruitful\narea has been that of games (see, e.g., Baltag, Li, &\nPedersen 2022; van Benthem, Pacuit, & Roy 2011, van Benthem 2014),\nwhere many different attitudes and concepts (knowledge, beliefs,\npreferences, intentions, awareness, actions and so on) converge. The\napplications of multi-modal logics are numerous and reach well beyond\nthe aspects of studies connected to the area of multi-agent systems in\nAI and Philosophical Logic that have been covered in this entry. \n",
