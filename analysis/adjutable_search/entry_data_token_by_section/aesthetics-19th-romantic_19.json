Romantic Legacy\n\nInterestingly, scholars tend to explain romantic aesthetics not only\nin terms of its sources (discussed in\n \u00a72.1),\n but also in terms of its legacy. While there are very interesting and\nwell-established connections between romantic aesthetics and modernism\n(see Abrams 1971, Frye 1968, Cavell 1979), this section focuses on the\nattempt to draw a link between the former and postmodernism, a link\nwhose ground is significantly weaker.\n\nIn recent decades, a large number of romantic scholars have argued\nthat romanticism, in general, and the romantic primacy of aesthetics,\nin particular, is a precursor of the fundamental outlook of\npostmodernist and poststructuralist views (see, for example,\nLacoue-Labarthe and Nancy 1988, Bowie 2003, Bowman 2014, and Gasche\n1991). This reading is based on the skepticism the romantics raised\nabout first principles and about systematicity, the romantic emphasis\non human creation and language, historicism and hermeneutics, their\nview of the fragmented nature of modern life and on certain\nformulations of the primacy of aesthetics that may seem, initially, to\nerase any distinction between what is \u201creal\u201d and what is\n\u201cpoetic\u201d, a product of the creative imagination. Friedrich\nSchlegel, for example, proclaims: \u201cNo poetry, no\nreality\u2026. There is, despite all the senses, no external world\nwithout imagination\u201d (AF: #350), and \u201cEverything that\nrests on the opposition between appearance and reality\u2026is not\npurely poetic\u201d (FLP: #146). \n\nThese proclamations may seem to suggest that \u201cthere is no way\nout\u201d of creative constructions, or \u201ctexts\u201d, or that\n\u201cart\u2026does not need to point beyond itself\u201d (Bowie\n2003: 53), as if romantic aesthetics anticipates central trends in\npost-modernism and\n post-structuralism.[8]\n But there are reasons to worry about such a\n\u201cpostmodernist\u201d reading. Some lines in\nromanticism\u2014skepticism about foundationalist philosophy and\nsystem-building, the emphasis on human creation, language, and the\nrole of historicism and hermeneutics\u2014are indeed related to\ncertain strands in postmodernism. But reading romantic aesthetics as\nproto-postmodernist is limited for a host of reasons.\n\nFirst, the romantic faith in the imaginative and emotive capacities\nassociated with the production and reception of art, and their\nskepticism of absolute principles and philosophical systems did not\nmake them skeptical of reason, as many postmodernist thinkers are (see\n \u00a72.1\n and Beiser 2003: 3). Even romantic skepticism of absolute principles\n(see\n \u00a73.1).\n cannot be equated with the rejection of all principles and rules. For\nexample, though art and art appreciation cannot be reduced to any\ngiven, prior rules, they are not lawless, but the source of their own\nnormativity (see\n \u00a73.3).\n\nSecond, in spite of the romantic stress on the fragmentary nature of\nhuman experience (embodied in their choice of the aphoristic style,\nwhich is emphasized by their post-modernist readers), the romantics\nnever gave up the striving after unity and wholeness. Art was not\nmeant as a replacement for unity, but exactly as the best way to\nstrive after and approximate unity in our modern and fragmentary\ncondition. \n\n\nFor the philosopher\u2026art is supreme, for it opens to him the\nholiest of holies, where that which is separated in nature and\nhistory, and which can never be united either in life and action or in\nthought, burns as though in a single flame in eternal and primordial\nunity. (Schelling, System of Transcendental Philosophy, 1800,\nin Heath 1978: 231)\n\n\nThird, the romantics\u2019 desire for and search after the Absolute\n(discussed in 3) is another reason to reject the post-modernist\ninterpretation. For such a desire is anathema to most post-modernist\nthinkers, who resist and shun the possibility (and desirability) of\nany absolute reality.\n\nMoreover, if one opposes the idea that there is \u201cno way out of\ntexts\u201d, or that reality is \u201cnothing other than\nconstruction\u201d, then the post-modernist reading of the romantics\nappears uncharitable. Fortunately, this interpretation does not force\nitself on us since there are many other charitable and (historically,\ntextually and philosophically) well-grounded readings of the\nproclamations just mentioned and of the romantic primacy of the\naesthetics. Many of these readings were proposed in this entry under\nthe umbrella of the formal approach to romantic aesthetics. On this\nformal account, rather than claiming that there is no distinction\nbetween \u201creality\u201d and \u201cfiction\u201d, or that there\nis \u201cno way out of imaginative constructions\u201d, the\nromantics urged human beings to fashion their ordinary life and\nphilosophy aesthetically for epistemological, metaphysical, ethical,\npolitical and scientific reasons.\n\nArguably, romantic aesthetics is not of merely historical interest.\nThis entry has pointed to a few facets of the relevance of romantic\naesthetics, thus supporting views like Berlin\u2019s, for example,\naccording to which the revolution brought about by romanticism is\n\u201cthe deepest and most lasting of all changes in the life of the\nWest\u2026\u201d (1999: xiii). Its tremendous impact on generations\nto come all the way up to the present day is one explanation of the\ndifficulty of precisely delimiting when the age of romanticism begins\nand when it ends. Indeed, rather than a post-romantic age, our age may\nbe yet another phase in the age of romanticism: \n\n\nRomanticism\u2026is the first major phase in an imaginative\nrevolution which has carried on until our own day, and has by no means\ncompleted itself yet.
