    "main_text": "Truthbearers, Truthmakers, Truth || Truthmakers\n2.2 Truthmakers\n\n\nTalk of truthmakers serves a function similar, but\ncorrelative, to talk of truthbearers. A truthmaker is anything that\nmakes some truthbearer true. Different versions of the correspondence\ntheory will have different, and often competing, views about what sort\nof items true truthbearers correspond to (facts, states of affairs,\nevents, things, tropes, properties). It is convenient to talk of\ntruthmakers whenever one wants to stay neutral between these\nchoices. Four points should be kept in mind:\n\nThe notion of a truthmaker is tightly connected with, and\ndependent on, the relational notion of truthmaking: a\ntruthmaker is whatever stands in the truthmaking relation to some\ntruthbearer. Despite the causal overtones of \u201cmaker\u201d and\n\u201cmaking\u201d, this relation is usually not supposed to be a\ncausal relation.\nThe terms \u201ctruthmaking\u201d and \u201ctruthmaker\u201d\nare ambiguous. For illustration, consider a classical correspondence\ntheory on which x is true if and only if x\ncorresponds to some fact. One can say (a) that x is\nmade true by a fact, namely the fact (or a fact)\nthat x corresponds to. One can also say (b)\nthat x is made true by x\u2019s correspondence to a\nfact. Both uses of \u201cis made true by\u201d are correct and\nboth occur in discussions of truth. But they are importantly different\nand must be distinguished. The (a)-use is usually the\nintended one; it expresses a relation peculiar to truth and leads to a\nuse of \u201ctruthmaker\u201d that actually picks out the items that\nwould normally be intended by those using the term. The\n(b)-use does not express a relation peculiar to truth; it is\njust an instance (for \u201cF\u201d = \u201ctrue\u201d) of the\ngeneric formula \u201cwhat makes an F-thing an F\u201d that can be\nemployed to elicit the definiens of a proposed definition of\nF. Compare: what makes an even number even is its divisibility by 2;\nwhat makes a right action right is its having better consequences than\navailable alternative actions. Note that anyone proposing a\ndefinition or account of truth can avail themselves of the notion of\ntruthmaking in the (b)-sense; e.g., a coherence theorist,\nadvocating that a belief is true if and only if it coheres with other\nbeliefs, can say: what makes a true belief true is its coherence with\nother beliefs. So, on the (b)-use, \u201ctruthmaking\u201d\nand \u201ctruthmaker\u201d do not signal any affinity with the basic\nidea underlying the correspondence theory of truth, whereas on the\n(a)-use these terms do signal such an affinity.\nTalk of truthmaking and truthmakers goes well with the basic idea\nunderlying the correspondence theory; hence, it might seem natural to\ndescribe a traditional fact-based correspondence theory as maintaining\nthat the truthmakers are facts and that the correspondence relation is\nthe truthmaking relation. However, the assumption that the\ncorrespondence relation can be regarded as (a species of) the\ntruthmaking relation is dubious. Correspondence appears to be\na symmetric relation (if x corresponds\nto y, then y corresponds to x), whereas it\nis usually taken for granted that truthmaking is\nan asymmetric relation, or at least not a symmetric one. It\nis hard to see how a symmetric relation could be (a species of) an\nasymmetric or non-symmetric relation (cf. David 2009.)\nTalk of truthmaking and truthmakers is frequently employed during\ninformal discussions involving truth but tends to be dropped when a\nmore formal or official formulation of a theory of truth is produced\n(one reason being that it seems circular to define or explain truth in\nterms of truthmakers or truthmaking). However, in recent years, the\ninformal talk has been turned into an official doctrine:\n\u201ctruthmaker theory\u201d. This theory should be distinguished\nfrom informal truthmaker talk: not everyone employing the latter would\nsubscribe to the former. Moreover, truthmaker theory should not simply\nbe assumed to be a version of the correspondence theory; indeed, some\nadvocates present it as a competitor to the correspondence theory (see\nbelow, Section 8.5).\n\n",
