The propositional content of a\njudgment, in turn, can vary along at least three different dimensions:\n(1) its relation to sensory content, (2) its relation to the\ntruth-conditions of propositions, and (3) its relation to the\nconditions for objective validity.\n2.2.1 A priori judgments and a posteriori judgments\n\nThe notion of \u201ccognitive content\u201d for Kant has two sharply\ndistinct senses: (i) intension or Inhalt, which is objective\nand representational (semantic content); and (ii) sensory matter or\nMaterie, which is subjective and non-representational,\nreflecting only the immediate conscious response of the mind to the\nexternal impressions or inputs that trigger the operations of the\nfaculty of sensibility (phenomenal qualitative content)\n(A19\u201320/B34, A320/B376). To be sure, for Kant just as for the\nEmpiricists, all cognition \u201cbegins with\u201d (mit \u2026\nanfange) the raw data of sensory impressions. But in a crucial\ndeparture from Empiricism and towards what might be called a\nmitigated rationalism, Kant also holds that not all cognition\n\u201carises from\u201d (entspringt \u2026 aus) sensory\nimpressions: so for him, a significant and unique contribution to both\nthe form and the objective representational content of cognition\narises from the innate spontaneous cognitive capacities (B1). This\nnotion of cognition\u2019s \u201carising from\u201d either sensory\nimpressions or innate spontaneous cognitive capacities can best be\nconstrued as a strict determination relation (similar to what is\nnowadays called \u201cstrong supervenience\u201d) such that\nX strictly determines Y if and only if the\nX-features of something are sufficient for its\nY-features, and there cannot be a change in anything\u2019s\nY-features without a corresponding change in its\nX-features. This allows us to say that a cognition is a\nposteriori, empirical, or dependent on sensory impressions and/or\ncontingent natural objects or facts just in case it is strictly\ndetermined in its form or in its semantic content by sensory\nimpressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts; but a\ncognition is a priori, non-empirical, or absolutely independent of\nall sensory impressions and/or contingent natural objects or\nfacts just in case it is not strictly determined in its form or\nin its semantic content by sensory impressions and/or contingent\nnatural objects or facts and is instead strictly determined in its\nform or in its semantic content by our innate spontaneous cognitive\nfaculties (B2\u20133). It should be noted that the apriority of a\ncognition in this sense is perfectly consistent with all sorts of\nassociated sensory impressions and also with the actual presence of\nsensory matter in that cognition, caused by contingent natural objects\nor facts, so long as neither the form nor the semantic content is\nstrictly determined by those sensory impressions and/or contingent\nnatural objects or facts. \u201cPure\u201d a priori cognitions are\nthose that in addition to being a priori or absolutely independent of\nall sensory impressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts,\nalso contain no sensory matter whatsoever (B3). So in other words,\nsome but not all a priori cognitions are pure.\n\nApplying these notions to judgments, it follows that a judgment is a\nposteriori if and only if either its logical form or its propositional\ncontent is strictly determined by sensory impressions and/or\ncontingent natural objects or facts; and a judgment is a priori if and\nonly if neither its logical form nor its propositional content is\nstrictly determined by sensory impressions and/or contingent natural\nobjects or facts, and both are instead strictly determined by our\ninnate spontaneous cognitive faculties, whether or not that cognition\nalso contains sensory matter. Kant also holds that a judgment is a\npriori if and only if it is necessarily true (Axv, B3\u20134,\nA76/B101). This strong connection between necessity and apriority\nexpresses (i) Kant\u2019s view that the contingency of a judgment is\nbound up with the modal dependence of its semantic content on sensory\nimpressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts, i.e., its\naposteriority (B3), (ii) his view that necessity is equivalent with\nstrict universality or strenge Allgemeinheit, which he\ndefines in turn as a proposition\u2019s lack of any possible\ncounterexamples or falsity-makers (B4), and (iii) his view that\nnecessity entails truth (A75\u201376/B100\u2013101). Furthermore\nKant explicitly holds that not only do a priori judgments really exist\nin various sciences, including physics and legitimate (i.e.,\ntranscendental idealist) metaphysics, but also that there really are\nsome pure a priori judgments, e.g., in mathematics\n(B4\u20135, B14\u201318).\n2.2.2 Analytic judgments and synthetic judgments\n\nKant\u2019s distinction between analytic and synthetic judgments is\nthe historical origin of, and therefore significantly related to,\nbut\u2014crucially\u2014not precisely equivalent, either in\nintension or extension, with the nowadays more familiar\nanalytic-synthetic distinction, according to which (1) analyticity is\ntruth by virtue of linguistic meaning alone, exclusive of empirical\nfacts, (2) syntheticity is truth by virtue of empirical facts, and (3)\nthe necessary statement vs. contingent statement distinction is\nformally and materially equivalent to the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. By 1950 this more familiar distinction was accepted as\ngospel truth by virtually all analytic philosophers: but in the two\ndecades after the publication of W.V.O. Quine\u2019s iconoclastic\n\u201cTwo Dogmas of Empiricism\u201d in 1951 (Quine 1961), it was\ngradually replaced by the new-and-improved post-Quinean gospel truth\nthat there is no such thing as an acceptable analytic-synthetic\ndistinction. This plain historical fact is closely related to the\nhighly regrettable further fact that Kant\u2019s analytic-synthetic\ndistinction is nowadays often wrongly interpreted (i) in terms of the\nmore familiar and now largely discredited analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, and also (ii) as reducible to an epistemic distinction\nbetween uninformatively or trivially true a priori judgments and\ninformative judgments. Ironically Frege, the father or grandfather of\nanalytic philosophy, was much nearer the mark in the Foundations\nof Arithmetic when he correctly construed Kant\u2019s theory of\nanalyticity semantically, as a theory about necessary\ninternal relations between concepts; although at the same time he not\nquite so correctly said that Kantian analyticity boils down to\n\u201csimply taking out of the box again what we have just put into\nit\u201d (Frege 1953, 101). Frege\u2019s 19th century\ncharacterization of Kantian analyticity, it turns out, has significant\nparallels with the 18th century Leibnizian and Wolffian theories of\nconceptual and/or logical truth that heavily influenced Kant\u2019s\nwork on analyticity (Anderson 2015). Backing away now from Frege and\nthe Leibniz-Wolff tradition, however, the crucial fact is that\nKant\u2019s analytic-synthetic distinction concerns two irreducibly\ndifferent kinds of semantic content within objectively valid\npropositions (Hanna 2001, chs. 3\u20134), and this distinction is\nneither primarily epistemic in character (although it does have some\nimportant epistemic implications [Hanna 2006b, 362\u2013379]) nor\ndoes it specifically concern the logical form of judgments (4:\n266).\n\nFrege regarded Kant\u2019s notion of analyticity as trivial; and,\ncorrespondingly, it is also true that if the Leibniz-Wolff approach to\nconceptual and/or logical truth largely determined Kant\u2019s theory\nof analyticity, then Kant\u2019s notion of analyticity is\nimpoverished (Anderson 2015). But on the contrary Kant\u2019s notion\nof analyticity is substantive, by virtue of five important ideas:\nfirst, Kant\u2019s pro-Leibnizian idea that all concepts\nhave intensional microstructures, or what he calls \u201clogical\nessences\u201d or \u201cconceptual essences\u201d (9: 61); second,\nhis anti-Leibnizian idea that logically possible worlds are\nnothing but maximal logically consistent sets of concepts, not\nthings-in-themselves (A571\u2013573/B599\u2013601); third, his\nreferentialist idea that all grammatically well-formed,\nsortally correct, and logically consistent concepts have non-empty\ncross-possible-worlds extensions (a.k.a. \u201ccomprehensions\u201d)\n(A239/B298\u2013299) (9: 95\u201396); fourth, his semantic\nrestrictionist idea that all and only objectively valid\npropositions have truth-values; and fifth, finally, and most\nimportantly, his logical analyticity idea that the notion of\nanalyticity covers not only the so-called \u201ccontainment\u201dof\npredicate-concepts in subject-concepts in categorical propositions,\nand not only the intensional identity of subject-concepts and\npredicate-concepts, but also all the logical truths of\ntruth-functional logic and monadic predicate logic. Then for Kant a\njudgment is analytic if and only if its propositional content is\nnecessarily true either by virtue of necessary internal relations\nbetween its objectively valid conceptual microstructures and/or its\nconceptual comprehensions, or by virtue of its truth-functional\nlogical connectives, or by virtue of its monadic predicate logical\nconnectives (Hanna 2001, ch. 3), leaving open the question of whether\nfor Kant all logical connectives are strictly truth-functional. In any\ncase, let this be repeated with strong emphasis: Kant does\nnot define analyticity in terms of either the containment or\nthe identity of concepts, which are at best sufficient conditions for\nanalyticity and not also necessary conditions for\nanalyticity. On the contrary, Kant explicitly states a universal,\nnecessary, and sufficient semantic criterion for the truth of analytic\njudgments, namely that a judgment is analytically true if and only if\nits denial entails a contradiction, in a broad sense of\n\u201centailment\u201d that includes intensional entailment and not\nmerely classical deductive entailment (A151/B190\u2013191). This\ncriterion also directly connects the notion of an analytic\ntruth with the notion of a logical truth in a\ncorrespondingly broad sense that fully includes the tautologies and\nvalid sentences of truth-functional logic and monadic predicate logic,\nbut is neither restricted to nor reducible to (with the addition of\n\u201clogical definitions\u201d [Frege 1953], whatever they\nactually turn out to be on Frege\u2019s account, which is not at all\nclear [Benacerraf 1981]) the truth-functional tautologies and valid\nsentences of classical polyadic predicate logic.\n\nNeedless to say, however, if one holds that the Kantian definition of\nanalyticity is truth-in-virtue-of-containment, and also that the\nKantian definition of syntheticity is\ntruth-in-virtue-of-non-containment, together with a Kantian\nconceptualist view of the nature of judgment, then one\u2019s\nconception of Kant\u2019s analytic and synthetic judgments will be\ncorrespondingly different (Anderson 2004, Anderson 2005, Anderson\n2009, Anderson 2015).\n\nBut what about syntheticity? Since for Kant the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction is exhaustive in the sense that every proposition is\neither analytic or synthetic but not both, his two-part doctrine of\nanalyticity in turn provides him with a two-part negative doctrine of\nsyntheticity: A proposition is synthetic if and only if its truth is\nnot strictly determined by relations between its conceptual\nmicrostructures or conceptual comprehensions alone, or by\ntruth-functional logic or monadic predicate logic alone (which for\nKant is expressively captured by the table of judgments and the table\nof pure concepts of the understanding); and a judgment is\nsynthetically true if and only if it is true and its denial does\nnot entail a contradiction. But this negative\ncharacterization of course does not tell us what the truth of\nsynthetic judgments positively consists in. In order to do this, Kant\ndirectly connects the semantics of syntheticity with the semantics of\nintuitions, just as he directly connects the semantics of analyticity\nwith the semantics of concepts (including both empirical concepts and\nthe pure concepts of the understanding). Then positively put, a\njudgment is synthetic if and only if its meaning and its truth are\nstrictly determined by its constituent intuitions, whether empirical\nintuitions or pure intuitions (A8, A154\u2013155/B193\u2013194,\nA721/B749) (8: 245) (11: 38). This is not to say either that synthetic\njudgments do not contain any concepts (in fact they always do\ncontain empirical or pure concepts), or even that the conceptual\ncomponents of a synthetic judgment are irrelevant to its meaning or\ntruth (in fact empirical or pure concepts always are\nsemantically relevant), but only to say that in a synthetic judgment\nit is the intuitional components that strictly determine its\nmeaning and truth, not its empirical-conceptual or pure-conceptual\ncomponents. In short, a synthetic judgment is an intuition-based\nproposition.\n2.2.3 Synthetic a priori judgments\n\nEvery reader of the Critique of Pure Reason knows that Kant\nglosses his philosophical project in that book as a complete and\nsystematic answer to the question, \u201chow are synthetic a\npriori judgments possible?\u201d (B19). Also every reader of the\nfirst Critique knows that Kant asserts the existence of\nsynthetic a priori judgments in mathematics, physics, and metaphysics\n(B14\u201318, A158/B197). But fewer readers are aware that this\nassertion, whether right or wrong, is certainly the boldest and\nperhaps also the most important claim in post-Cartesian metaphysics.\nThis is because it posits the thesis of modal dualism, or the\nclaim that there are two irreducibly different basic types of\nnecessary truth, in the face of the almost universally-held\ncounter-thesis of modal monism, or the claim that there is\none and only basic type of necessary truth, i.e., analytically or\nlogically necessary truth. Given Kant\u2019s theory of truth, modal\ndualism also implies the worldly existence of two irreducibly\ndifferent types of modal facts as truth-makers for analytically and\nsynthetically necessary truths respectively. In short if Kant is\nright, then there are fundamentally more things in heaven and earth\nthan modal monists are prepared to acknowledge. Moreover Kant holds\nthat all the basic statements of traditional metaphysics are, at least\nin intention, synthetic a priori judgments (B18). Hence his famous\ncritique of traditional metaphysics in the Transcendental Dialectic is\nnothing but a deepened and extended investigation of the possibility\nof synthetic a priori judgments.\n\nBut what is a synthetic a priori judgment? Combining the a\npriori-a posteriori distinction with the analytic-synthetic\ndistinction, Kant derives four possible kinds of judgment: (1)\nanalytic a priori, (2) analytic a posteriori, (3) synthetic a priori,\nand (4) synthetic a posteriori. By virtue of the fact that analytic\njudgments are necessarily true, and given Kant\u2019s thesis that\nnecessity entails apriority, it follows that all analytic judgments\nare a priori and that there is no such thing as an analytic a\nposteriori judgment. By contrast, synthetic judgments can be either a\npriori or a posteriori. Synthetic a posteriori judgments are\nempirical, contingent judgments, although they may vary widely as to\ntheir degree of generality. Synthetic a priori judgments, by contrast,\nare non-empirical, non-contingent judgments.\n\nMore precisely however, synthetic a priori judgments have three\nessential features. First, because a synthetic a priori judgment is a\npriori, its meaning and truth are strictly underdetermined by sensory\nimpressions and/or contingent natural objects or facts, and it is also\nnecessarily true. Second, because a synthetic a priori judgment is\nsynthetic, not analytic, its truth is not determined by\nconceptual/truth-functional-logical/monadic-predicate-logical factors\nalone, and its denial is logically consistent. Third, as is the case\nwith all synthetic judgments, the meaning and truth of a synthetic a\npriori judgment is intuition-based. This third factor is the crucial\none. For while the meaning and truth of synthetic a posteriori\njudgments is based on empirical intuitions, the\nmeaning and truth of synthetic a priori judgments is based on pure\nintuitions or our a priori formal representations of space and\ntime (B73) (8: 245) (11: 38). Now since according to Kant our a priori\nformal representations of space and time are both necessary conditions\nof the possibility of human experience and also necessary\nconditions of the objective validity or empirical meaningfulness of\njudgments, which in turn confers truth-valuedness upon propositions,\nit then follows that a synthetic a priori judgment is a proposition\nthat is true in all and only the humanly experienceable possible\nworlds and truth-valueless otherwise (Hanna 2001, 239\u2013245). By\nsharp contrast, analytic judgments, as logical truths in either a\nnarrow (truth-functional or syllogistic) or broad (intensional logic)\nsense, are true in all logically possible worlds, including those\nlogically possible worlds in which human experience is not\npossible, i.e., the worlds containing non-phenomenal or non-apparent\nentities, especially including things-in-themselves, i.e., the\n\u201cnoumenal worlds.\u201d\n\nSo analytic and synthetic a priori judgments sharply differ not only\nin the nature of their semantic content (i.e.,\nconcept-based/truth-functional-logic-based/monadic-predicate-logic-based\nvs. intuition-based) but also in their modal scope (true in all\nlogically possible worlds vs. true in all and only humanly\nexperienceable worlds and truth-valueless otherwise). Nevertheless,\ndespite this sharp difference in modal scope\u2014from which it\nfollows, perhaps surprisingly, that for Kant there are logically\npossible worlds in which synthetic a priori propositions such as\n\u201c7+5=12\u201d are thinkably deniable\u2014since synthetic a\npriori judgments are either true or truth-valueless in every\nlogically possible world, it also follows that they are never\nfalse in any logically possible world and thus satisfy\nKant\u2019s general definition of a necessary truth, i.e., that a\nproposition is necessary if and only if it is strictly universally\ntrue, in that it is true in every member of a complete class of\npossible worlds and has no possible counterexamples or falsity-makers\n(Hanna 2001, ch. 5). Less abstractly and gallumphingly put, a\nsynthetic a priori judgment is a necessary truth with a human\nface.\n\nIn the discussion so far, judgments are essentially identified with\ntheir propositional contents. But according to Kant it is also\npossible for a rational cognizer to use the very same\npropositional content in different ways. The fundamental difference in\nuses of judgments is between (a) theoretical judgments and (b)\nnon-theoretical judgments. But there are also some crucial differences\nbetween theoretical uses of judgments. For a discussion of these kinds\nof use, see the following supplementary document:\n\nKinds of Use\n\n",
