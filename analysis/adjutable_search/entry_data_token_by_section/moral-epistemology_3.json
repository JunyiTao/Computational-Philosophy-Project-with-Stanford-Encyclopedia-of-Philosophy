    "main_text": "Ontological: Moral Facts and Moral Naturalism || Theological Facts\n3.1 Theological Facts\n\n\nAn ancient view still popular today is that moral knowledge must\nultimately be based on the will or commandments of the Creator. This\nview faces two major problems. First, there is the obvious difficulty\nthat skepticism about God\u2019s existence is at least as difficult to lay\nto rest as skepticism about moral knowledge. Since arguments for and\nagainst the existence of God are assessed elsewhere in this\nEncyclopedia, I will not stop to rehearse them here. Second,\nthere is the further difficulty that even if we are confident about\nGod\u2019s existence, it is not clear how we can interpret the will or\ncommandments of God without first having moral knowledge, thus making\nthis reply to the skeptic question-begging.\n\n\nThe latter problem arises from a dilemma posed in Plato\u2019s\nEuthyphro. In this dialogue Euthyphro tries to explain to\nSocrates that piety is what the gods love. Socrates then asks Euthyphro\nwhether the gods love the pious because they are good or whether the\npious are good because the gods love them. To put the dilemma in terms\nrelevant to the present context, consider the view that genocide is\nwrong because it is contrary to God\u2019s will. (The argument doesn\u2019t\nchange if we talk about commandments or love instead of will.) We can\nask of this view whether God forbids genocide because it is wrong, or\nwhether it is wrong because God forbids it. In the latter case God\u2019s\nwill appears to be arbitrary or at least not based on an appropriate\nmoral reason. For believers who regard God as supremely moral, the\nlatter possibility would be unacceptable. In the former case, however,\nGod\u2019s will would be based on the wrongness of genocide, conceived as\nbeing separate from and logically prior to the concept of God\u2019s will.\nHence, in this case the appeal to God\u2019s will does not provide an answer\nto the skeptic, but rather presupposes that we already have an answer.\nIn sum, unless we are prepared to suppose that what God wills, loves,\nor commands has no moral basis, the attempt to base the possibility of\nmoral knowledge on knowledge of God\u2019s will or love or commandments is,\nlike Euthyphro\u2019s explanation of piety, viciously circular. (For\ndiscussion of other versions of the objection, see Chandler 1984 and\nWestmoreland 1996. Also see the entry on\n theological voluntarism.)\n",
