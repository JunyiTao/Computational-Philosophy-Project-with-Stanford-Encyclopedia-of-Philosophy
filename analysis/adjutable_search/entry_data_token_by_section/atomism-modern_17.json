    "main_text": "Brownian Motion || Further Dimensions of Perrin's Case\n7. Concluding Remarks\n\n\nIf we take atomism to involve the claim that the properties of\nmacroscopic matter arise as a result of the combinations and motions\nof tiny particles, then it is a position confirmed by the time of the\nSolvay Conference in 1911 in a way that left little room for sensible\ndoubt. But if we take atomism in a stronger sense, to mean a theory\nthat explains all of the properties of macroscopic matter in terms of\nunderlying particles with specified properties and governed by\nspecified laws, then it must be denied that atomism had reached its\nobjective in 1911. There were identifiable inadequacies and gaps in\nthe specification of the properties of atoms and the electrons and\nprotons that compose them and there were to an increasing extent\nproblematic experimental results that were eventually to lead to a\nradical change in the laws that were presumed to govern the behaviour\nof atomic and sub-atomic particles.\n\n\nAcceptance of the kinetic theory implied acceptance of the existence\nof atoms and molecules with a well-defined mass. However, it was\nperfectly clear that they must have further properties. For example,\nthey needed properties that would explain chemical combination, and,\nspecifically, the notion of valency. They also needed properties that\nwould account for spectra. Answers to these challenges were\nforthcoming in the form of the electron structure of the atom and the\nquantum mechanics that governs it. There is a sense in which\ncontemporary physics, with its account of the properties of atoms and\nmolecules in terms of their electron structure and the explanation of\nmany macroscopic phenomena in terms of the atomic and molecular\nstructures underlying them, comes close to the ideal of Democritus. A\ngeneral account of the properties of the material world is offered in\nterms of underlying particles with a few well-defined properties\ngoverned by well-defined laws. The difference between the contemporary\nsituation and the ideals of Democritus or the mechanical philosophers\nlies in the epistemological access to the general atomistic\ntheory. The contemporary theory became possible only as a result of\ncenturies of scientific development. The quantum mechanical laws\ngoverning the atomic world were responses to quite specific problems\nrevealed by experiment in areas such as black-body radiation, emission\nand absorption spectra, the specific heats of gases and\nradioactivity. The properties ascribed to electrons, for instance,\nsuch as their charge and half-integral spin, were themselves responses\nto quite specific experimental findings involving discharge tube\nphenomena and spectra.  Atomism, which began its life as speculative\nmetaphysics, has become a securely established part of experimental\nscience.\n",
