    "main_text": "Unorthodox Conceptions of Persons || C\u0101rv\u0101ka\n2.3 C\u0101rv\u0101ka\n\nThe last group of philosophers to consider in this section are the\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas. C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers are materialists in\nthe classical Indian tradition and the most ardent critics of the\nVedas and scriptural authority among the heterodox schools. They deny\nthe existence of the self, as the essence of the person and with it\nthe possibility of transmigration and rebirth. They are the only\nphilosophers in the classical Indian tradition that rejected the\ndoctrine of karma and liberation or freedom. Death of the\nbody is the end of the person. The C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers are\nbest thought of as defending animalism or the biological view of\npersonal identity. The C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers argued that a\nperson, just like everything else in the world, is just a body, an\naggregate of material elements qualifies by consciousness.\nConsciousness is an emergent property of the four material elements\n(earth, water, fire and air) in a specific proportion. The\nC\u0101rv\u0101kas offer the analogy of an Indian after dinner treat\ncalled \u201cpaan\u201d which releases red colour when\nchewed even though none of its ingredients (betel leaf, chopped\nbetelnut (areca) and slaked lime (calcium hydroxide)), are red. Just\nso consciousness emerges when several material elements come together\nin a specific proportion that constitutes a person. Their view is\nsurprisingly close to modern day physicalism. They did not believe in\nthe existence of the soul as the essence of the individual person or\nany other immaterial substance. The main argument against the\nexistence of the self rests on an epistemological principle:\nperception is the only source of knowledge. The argument can be stated\nthus:\n\nP1: The self cannot be perceived.\n\nP2: Whatever exists must be perceived.\n\nC: The self does not exist.\n\n\nAnother argument offered by the C\u0101rv\u0101kas for the claim that\na person is identical with the body is a linguistic argument. Consider\nsentences: \u201cI am youthful\u201d, \u201cI am stout\u201d. In\nthese sentences the \u201cI\u201d refers to the body. Linguistic\narguments were quite common in classical Indian philosophy because of\nthe influence of the grammarians and also because the Indian\nphilosophers paid attention to common speech behaviour which\npresumably expresses what common sense teaches us. With respect to the\nconception of a self, philosophers in the Indian tradition paid\nattention to the usages employing the first-person pronoun as data\nthat any philosophical theory of the self must account for. The\nNy\u0101ya philosophers also relied on arguments from language to\nrespond to the C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophers. The Ny\u0101ya\nphilosophers claim that the referent of \u2018I\u2019, whatever it\nis, appears in our consciousness as something internal. Therefore,\n\u2018I\u2019 cannot refer to the body. Furthermore, the word\n\u2018I\u2019 in each person\u2019s mouth refers to (picks out,\ndenotes) that person uniquely. The referent of \u2018I\u2019 cannot\nbe a generic body (material object) because it does not refer to the\nbody of another person. Nor can \u2018I\u2019 refer to one\u2019s\nown body because properties of the body (physical characteristics) are\nnot sufficient to identify a unique person. Any physical property, for\nexample, the shape of the body is an essential property of the body,\nbut other bodies can have exactly the same shape. If the term\n\u2018I\u2019 referred properties of the body, two persons who have\nexactly the same shape would be equally good candidates for the\nreferent of a given use of \u2018I\u2019 by either of them.\nTherefore, \u2018I\u2019 cannot refer to the body. And lastly, the\nNaiy\u0101yikas challenged the C\u0101rv\u0101kas to account for\nphrases like \u2018my body\u2019. Such phrases suggest that there is\na distinction between me and the body, it implies that there is\nsomething, the referent of \u2018I\u2019, a self, which has or\npossesses a body. The C\u0101rv\u0101kas dismiss such phrases as\n\u2018my body\u2019 are mere metaphors and do not indicate that\nthere is a self that is separate from the body. It is worth noting\nthat the Naiy\u0101yikas and other Hindu philosophers have a similar\nproblem accounting for statements such as \u201cI am fat\u201d,\n\u201cI am tall\u201d etc.\n\nTo conclude, it is worth noting that apart from Abhidharma Buddhism\nand Advaita Ved\u0101nta, most Buddhist philosophers and other\nclassical Indian philosophers accept that persons are real.\n",
