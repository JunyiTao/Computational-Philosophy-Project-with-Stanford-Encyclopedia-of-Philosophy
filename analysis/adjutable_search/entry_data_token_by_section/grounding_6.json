    "main_text": "The Nature of Grounding\n2. The Nature of Grounding\n\nThere are a variety of issues to address related to the nature of\ngrounding. In this section we focus on objectivity, representation,\nhyperintensionality, non-monotonicity, whether grounding is a strict\norder, and whether grounding is well-founded. There are other\ninteresting issues concerning the nature of grounding that we\ndon\u2019t have the space to discuss here. One such issue is that of\nmeta-ground, viz. what if anything grounds the facts about\nwhat grounds what (see Litland 2020 for an overview).\n",
