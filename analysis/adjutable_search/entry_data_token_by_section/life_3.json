    "main_text": "Artificial and Synthetic Life\n3. Artificial and Synthetic Life\n\n\nThe rest of this article will focus on uses of the various life\nconcepts. Some of the definitions described above are derived from, or\nnecessary for, specific scientific and societal purposes. This section\nfocuses on artificial and synthetic life.\nIn principle, most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe\nlife can be created, but there is broad disagreement as to what needs\nto be recreated for something to be life. In functional approaches,\nmere formal organization sufficiently similar to organisms may be\nenough. Complexly configured robots (\u201chardware\u201d) or computer programs (\u201csoftware\u201d) might qualify. This view is known as Strong Artificial Life (A-Life for short) and has received much of the same pushback as the Strong Artificial Intelligence\napproach before it (Sober 1991, Boden 1999, Brooks 2001). Those who\nreject the Strong A-Life view believe that functional approaches miss\nsome of the essential features of biology for either epistemic or\nontological reasons. Epistemic objections might be consistent with the\npossibility of Strong A-Life, but doubt that we have the knowledge to\nrecreate the relevant biological functions in a digital framework.\nConversely, most of the objections to Strong A-Life have been\nontological, resting on the view that representations cannot be\nequivalent to that which they represent and that perhaps life requires chemical embodiment, ruling Strong A-Life impossible by fiat.\nWeak A-Life approaches, on the other hand, don\u2019t presume the\nontological equivalence of structurally similar circuits and cells.\nInstead, proponents suggest the more modest goal of developing a deeper\nunderstanding of life as we know it by exploring the effects of various\nparameters in simulations, effectively placing life in a broader\ncontext of possible biology (Langton 1989, 1995). For example, in the\nTerra program, software was pitted against other software for\nprocessing power (Ray 1993). Unexpected by the researchers at the time,\nsoftware parasitism evolved: software would co-opt the reproductive\nprocessing of other software. Policing mechanisms also evolved, leading\nto an arms race between free-riders and the software trying to stop\nthem.\nWhether one accepts the strong or weak interpretation of A-Life,\nthese in silico approaches are cheaper than equivalent work done in\nreal organisms. They also offer possibilities that are not available in\nordinary biology, such as programming alternative parameters to take\nthe place of laws of nature and exploring relationships across deep\ntime and space quickly and efficiently.\nAnother approach worth highlighting is that of synthetic life\n(\u201cwetware\u201d). Less conceptually troubled, synthetic life can\nalso address some questions of A-Life, while allowing for a finer grain\nof realism. Synthetic life approaches have explored creating\nself-replication (Lincoln & Joyce 2009), minimal genomes (Koonin\n2000, Hutchinson et al. 2016), a chemical evolution (Gromski et al.\n2020), and other projects. Not all synthetic biology is in the business\nof investigating life as it could be, as not all computer programming\nis A-Life. Nevertheless, the tools developed by both can be\nilluminating. By exploring possibilities, scientists can discover\npreviously hidden relationships, revealing which aspects of life are\nmore or less plausible than expected.\n",
