    "main_text": "\n1. The Puzzles\n\nPuzzles of material constitution played an important role in the\ndevelopment of philosophy and continue to be a source of much debate\ntoday. Here, we introduce four of the most famous puzzles.\n\nThe Debtor\u2019s Paradox. The ancient playwright Epicharmus\ntells the tale of a poor but resourceful debtor. When approached for\npayment, the man responds with a riddle. If you add a pebble to a\ncollection of pebbles, you no longer have the same number. If you add\na length to a cubit, you no longer have the same measure. In the same\nway, if you add a bit of matter to an existing portion of matter, you\nno longer have the same entity. Since man is nothing more than a\nmaterial object whose matter is constantly changing, we do not survive\nfrom one moment to the next. The debtor concludes that he is not the\nsame person who incurred the debt, so he cannot be held responsible\nfor the payment. The exasperated creditor then strikes the debtor, who\nprotests the abusive treatment. The creditor expresses sympathy, but\npoints out that he cannot be held accountable for the assault. After\nall, material change has already taken place so, by the debtor\u2019s\nown line of reasoning, the guilty party is no longer present. The\nscene is intended to be comedic, but the argument is no laughing\nmatter. The man who incurred the debt was constituted by one portion\nof matter, M1. The man who is approached for payment is\nconstituted by a distinct portion of matter, M2 (let us\nassume, for the sake of argument, that M2 consists of\nM1, together with some new matter). If constitution is\nidentity, then the debtor\u2019s reasoning is sound: the man\napproached for payment is not the man who incurred the debt. More\ngenerally, this version of the argument would show that it is\nimpossible for material objects to survive the addition of any new\nparts. (Note: the claim that constitution is identity should not be\nconfused with the thesis of \u201ccomposition as identity\u201d. On the latter\nview, see Section 8 of the entry on\n identity.)\n\nThe Puzzle of Dion and Theon. The Stoic philosopher\nChrysippus asks us to consider the case of Dion and Theon, where Dion\nis a normal human being and Theon is a large part of Dion consisting\nof everything but Dion\u2019s right foot. Suppose now that the right\nfoot is removed. Theon obviously survives the operation, for his parts\nremain completely unchanged. But, in that case, it seems as if Dion\ndoes not survive the operation, for otherwise we would have\ntwo people in the same place at the same time. Hence, Dion does not\nsurvive the loss of his foot. More generally, the argument would show\nthat material objects cannot survive the loss of any constituent\nparts. (A modern version of the puzzle, due to Peter Geach, concerns\nTibbles and Tib, where Tibbles is a cat and Tib a cat-part consisting\nof everything but Tibbles\u2019s tail.)\n\nThe Ship of Theseus Puzzle. The ancient historian Plutarch\nrecounts the story of the famous ship of Theseus, whose parts were all\ngradually replaced as they wore down. The resulting ship was\neventually displayed in Athens, where philosophers debated whether it\nwas still the original ship of Theseus, despite having none of the\noriginal parts. In the modern era, Thomas Hobbes added a further twist\nto the story. Suppose that a custodian collected the original planks\nas they were removed from the ship and later put them back together in\nthe original arrangement. In this version of the story, we are left\nwith two seafaring vessels, one on display in Athens and one in the\npossession of the custodian. But where is the original Ship of\nTheseus? Some will say that the ship is with the museum, since ships\ncan survive the complete replacement of parts (provided, at least,\nthat the change is sufficiently gradual). Others will say that the\nship is with the custodian, since ships can survive being disassembled\nand reassembled. Both answers seems correct, but this means that, at\nthe end of the story, the ship of Theseus is in two places at once.\nMore generally, the argument suggests that it is possible for one\nmaterial object to exist in two places at the same time. We get an\nequally implausible result by working backwards. After all, there are\nclearly two ships at the end of the story, but both ships were also\naround at the beginning, for the reasons just given. So, at the\nbeginning of the story, there were two ships of Theseus occupying the\nsame place at the same time\u2014one of which would go on to the\nmuseum and one of which would end up with the custodian.\n\nThe Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay. Various ancient\nphilosophers, including Aristotle, pointed out that statues seem to\ndiffer in important respects from the portions of matter from which\nthey are made. Suppose that, on Monday, a sculptor purchases an\nunformed lump of clay, which he names \u2018Lump\u2019. Suppose\nfurther that, on Tuesday, the artist sculpts the clay into the form of\nthe biblical king David and names his statue \u2018David\u2019. It\nis tempting to say that, in this case, there is only one object in the\nsculptor\u2019s hands\u2014David just is Lump. But, on\nreflection, this identification is problematic, since Lump and David\nseem to differ in many respects. For example, Lump existed on Monday,\nwhereas David did not. Moreover, Lump could survive being squashed\ntomorrow, whereas David could not. However, this would imply that Lump\nand David and numerically distinct entities, since Leibniz\u2019s Law tells\nus that numerical identity requires qualitiative sameness. The upshot,\nonce again, is that it is possible for two material objects to exist\nin the same place at the same time.\n\nThese four puzzles differ in details, but raise a common problem. (A\nfifth\n puzzle\u2014the problem of the many\u2014raises\n significantly different issues and is dealt with in a separate\nentry.) We will focus on the case of the statue and the clay, and we\nwill formulate the puzzle as follows:\n\nDavid did not exist on Monday (but does exist on Tuesday).\nLump did exist on Monday (and also exists on Tuesday).\nIf (1) and (2), then David is not identical to Lump.\n[So] David is not identical to Lump.\n\n\nThe premises of the argument are plausible, but the conclusion is\nproblematic, for it implies the possibility of spatially\ncoincident objects\u2014something that we ordinarily take to be\nimpossible.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are five possible replies to this puzzle.\nFirst, one could simply accept (4) and admit that David is not\nidentical to Lump. We consider this response in sections 2 and 3,\nwhere we discuss the constitution view of David Wiggins\n(1968) and the temporal parts theory of David Lewis (1976).\nSecond, one could deny (1) by either denying the existence of David or\nby insisting that David existed on Monday. We consider these responses\nin section 4, where we discuss the eliminativist views of\nPeter Unger (1979), Peter van Inwagen (1990), and Roderick Chisholm\n(1979). Third, one could deny (2) by either denying the existence of\nLump (as the eliminativist does) or by claiming that Lump does not\nsurvive being shaped into a statue. We consider this second option in\nsection 5, where we discuss the dominant kinds view of\nMichael Burke (1992). Fourth, one could deny (3) by rejecting the\nstandard formulation of Leibniz\u2019s Law. We consider this response\nin section 6, where we discuss the relative identity theory\nof Peter Geach (1967). Fifth and finally, one could respond to the\nparadox by insisting that the underlying issues are in some sense\nverbal, so that there is no fact of the matter about which premise (if\nany) is false. We consider this response in section 7, where we\ndiscuss the deflationist views of Rudolf Carnap (1950) and\nothers. (For an alternative survey of these issues, along with a\ncollection of relevant papers, see Rea 1987.)\n\nNote that, while our focus throughout will be on material objects,\nsimilar problems arise for other kinds of entities, including events,\nproperties, and groups\u2014see, for example, Pfeifer (1989),\nShoemaker (2003), and Uzquiano (2004a).\n2. Coincident Objects\n\nThe most popular reply to the puzzle of material constitution is to\nembrace the conclusion: Lump and Statue exist at the same place at the\nsame time, but differ in their historical and modal properties, so it\nis possible for there to be two material objects in the same place at\nthe same time. This view is sometimes referred to as the\nconstitution view since it holds that the statue is constituted\nby, but not identical to, the lump of clay from which it is formed. In\na slogan: constitution is not identity (Johnston 1992).\nConstitution is distinguished from identity insofar as it is an\nasymmetric relation\u2014Lump constitutes Statue, but not\nvice versa. Constitution is also taken to be a\ndependence relation\u2014as David Wiggins (1968, p. 91) puts\nit, the statue \u201cconsists in\u201d and is \u201cnothing over\nand above\u201d the lump of clay. (For more on the nature of\nconstitution, see Wasserman 2004.)\n\nThe constitution view is extremely popular, having been defended by\nWiggins (1968), Doepke (1982), Lowe (1983, 1995, 2003), Simons (1985),\nYablo (1987), Oderberg (1996), Baker (1997, 2000, 2002), Thomson\n(1998), Shoemaker (1999), Fine (2003), Koslicki (2008), and many\nothers. Indeed, the view is so common, it is sometimes called\n\u201cthe standard account\u201d (Burke 1992). Why not join the\ncrowd?\n\n\u201cJust try to walk through a wall,\u201d quips the skeptic.\n\u201cTwo things can\u2019t be in the same place at the same\ntime!\u201d We will call this the impenetrability objection,\nsince it appeals to the common idea that impenetrability is the mark\nof the material (Descartes 1641 [1993, p. 13]).\n\nThe constitution theorist has a ready reply to the this objection.\nUnlike you and the wall, David and Lump share the same parts, and this\nmaterial coincidence explains how they are able to occupy the\nsame place at the same time (Wiggins 1968). Material coincidence also\nhelps to answer another common complaint. Suppose that Lump weighs\n10lbs. David will obviously weigh the same. So why don\u2019t you get\na reading of 20lbs. when you place both on the scale? (Lewis 1986, p.\n252) Answer: because the two objects share the same weight as\na result of sharing the same parts (Zimmerman 1995, p. 89, fn. 57).\nHere it is important to note that we do not determine the weight of a\nwall, for example, by summing up the weight of its bricks and\nits constituent molecules, since that would involve counting some parts\nmore than once. According to the constitution theorist, weighing David\nand Lump would involve the same kind of double-counting.\n\nMaterial coincidence may explain how spatial coincidence is possible,\nbut what about material coincidence itself? On the face of it, the\nclaim that different things can be made up out of the exact same parts\nis no more plausible than the claim that different things can be\nlocated in the exact same place. We will call this the\nextensionality objection, since it appeals to the common idea\nthat wholes are individuated by their parts in the same way that sets\nare individuated by their members.\n\nOne obvious response to this objection is to reject extensionality\n(Thomson 1983). However, this move comes at a cost since it requires\ngiving up on classical\n mereology.\n A second response is to deny that objects like David and Lump share\nall their material parts. For example, Baker (2000, p. 81)\nsuggests that David\u2019s nose is a part of David, but not a part of Lump.\nA third response is to grant that coinciding objects share all their\nmaterial parts, while insisting that they differ in some\nnon-material aspect (see, for example, Rea 1998, McDaniel\n2001. Paul 2002, Koslicki 2008, and Brower 2014). The most familiar\nversion of this view traces back to Aristotelian idea that material\nobjects are compounds of matter and form (see\n Aristotle\u2019s metaphysics).\n\nWhether or not David and Lump share all the same parts, it is clear\nthat they share many of the same properties. Both have the same\nweight, the same size, and the same shape. Indeed, the two seem to be\nperfect duplicates, right down to their sub-atomic structure. But this\nraises a puzzle: how could duplicates of this kind differ in their\ntemporal properties, persistence conditions, and the like? We will\nrefer to this as the grounding objection since it appeals to\nthe common idea that such properties must be grounded in more basic\nfeatures of an object. (For different statements of this worry, see\nSimons 1987, pp. 225\u20136, Heller 1990, pp. 30\u20132, Burke 1992,\nZimmerman 1995, pp. 87\u20138, and Olson 2001. The objection is\nsometimes put in terms of\n supervenience,\n but, as Bennett 2004 points out, supervenience is importantly\ndifferent from\n grounding.)\n\nThe natural response to this objection is to appeal to differences in\nkind (Wiggins 1980). Lump can survive being squashed or\nrolled into a ball, for example, since Lump is a mere lump of clay.\nDavid, however, is a statue, and statues cannot survive changes of\nthese kinds. This response, however, pushes back the explanatory\nchallenge: how could intrinsic duplicates like Lump and David differ\nin kind? One option would be to appeal to relational\ndifferences. For example, Lynne Rudder Baker suggests that\nDavid\u2014unlike Lump\u2014is a statue because it is essentially\nrelated to an artworld\u2014it is the sort of thing that is admired,\nreviewed, and discussed (Baker 2000, pp. 35\u201346). The problem is\nthat this seems to get things backwards, for it is natural to say that\nDavid is admired, reviewed, and discussed because it is a\nstatue (rather than a mere lump of clay). A related idea is to\nexplain the difference in kind by appealing to differences in\nhistorical facts (Burke 1992, p. 15). For example, one might\nsay that Lump is a mere lump of clay because it was created by a\nclaymaker whose intent was to create a lump, whereas David was created\nby a sculptor whose intent was to create a statue. One worry for this\nline of response is that it cannot be extended to every case of\nconstitution. For example, Alan Gibbard (1975) asks us to imagine a\ncase in which an artist sculpts a statue of the biblical giant Goliath\nin two pieces\u2014bottom and top\u2014and then brings those pieces\ntogether, simultaneously creating a statue (\u2018Goliath\u2019) and\na new piece of clay (\u2018Lumpl\u2019). The next day, the artist\nsmashes the statue to bits, simultaneously destroying both the statue\nand the lump. The crucial feature of this case is that Lumpl and\nGoliath share all of their historical properties and appear\nto stand in the same relations to everything else around\nthem. For example, both are created at the same time, by the same\nperson, with a single set of intentions. Both are put on display in\nthe same galleries and gazed upon by the same patrons. Both are\ndestroyed at the same time, in exactly the same way. In short, Lumpl\nand Goliath seem to share all their relational properties while still\ndiffering in kind, in which case the explanatory challenge remains\nunanswered. (For recent discussions of this issue, see DeRosset 2011,\nEinheuser 2011, Sutton 2012, Saenz 2015, and Koslicki 2018.)\n\nAt this point we have reviewed the three most common complaints about\nthe constitution view: the impenetrability worry, the extensionality\nobjection, and the grounding problem. A fourth and final concern is\nwhat we might call the anthropic objection (see, for example,\nSosa 1987, Sider 2001, pp. 156\u20138, and section 2.5 of the entry\non\n ordinary objects.)\n So far, we have focused on the question of whether two material\nobjects\u2014like David and Lump\u2014could exist at the same place\nand time. But why stop at two? Consider the mereological\nsum of David and Lump\u2019s material simples. Those simples existed\nlong before David or Lump came into existence, so the sum would appear\nto be another object in addition to the statue and the lump. But why\nstop at three? Consider the instatue that coincides\nwith David whenever that statue is indoors and then goes out of\nexistence whenever David is taken outside (cf. Hirsch 1982, p. 32).\nThere is also the tablestatue (that exists when and only when the\nstatue is on a table), the litstatue (that exists when and only when\nthe statue is in the light), the dinnerstatue (that exists only when\nthe statue\u2019s sculptor is eating dinner), and so on. Ernest Sosa\n(1987) refers to this multiplication of entities as \u201cthe\nexplosion of reality\u201d.\n\nDefenders of the constitution view may try to run from the explosion\nand insist that there are only two (or three, or four) objects in the\nsame place at the same time. But what could justify this exclusionary\nattitude? Granted, we do not normally concern ourselves with\ninstatues, litstatues, and the rest. Ordinary English does not even\nhave sortal terms for discussing these entities. But these\nare facts about our interests and linguistic decisions. Why should we\nthink that there is a correspondence between the sortal terms\nin our language and the kinds of objects in the world? One\nway to explain this correspondence would be to claim that reality is\ndetermined, in some sense, by our conceptual scheme. But the\nconstitution view is normally offered as an alternative to\nanti-realist views of this kind. Perhaps, then, the constitution\ntheorist should accept Sosa\u2019s explosion and say that our\ninattentiveness does not exclude things like instatues and litstatues\nfrom the realm of being? Perhaps all of those objects exist at the\nsame place at the same time, sharing the same parts and the same\nmatter (Yablo 1987, Bennett 2004, Hawthorne 2006, Fairchild 2019)?\nPerhaps. But this brings us very close to adopting a different view\nof material constitution. It is to that view that we now turn.\n3. Temporal Parts\n\nConsider the case of Interstate 5. I-5 runs through Washington,\nOregon, and California, but the road is not wholly present in any of\nthose states. Rather, I-5 exists in different states by having\ndifferent road segments in each\u2014there is the Washington segment\nof I-5, the Oregon segment, etc. According to the temporal parts\ntheory (or four-dimensionalism), persistence through\ntime is exactly like that. (Quine 1953, Lewis 1976, Sider\n2001) Just as roads exist at different places by having distinct\nspatial parts at those places, material objects exist at different\ntimes by having distinct temporal parts at those times. In\nthe case of David Lewis, for example, there is the 1970s segment, the\n1980s segment, and so on. More formally, we can say that x is\na temporal part of y at (or during) t if and only if\n(i) x is a part of y at (or during) t, (ii)\nx overlaps everything that is a part of y at (or\nduring) t, and (iii) x exists only at (or during)\nt (Sider 2001, p. 60).\n\nConsider now the case of U.S. Route 29, which runs from the western\nsuburbs of Baltimore to Pensacola, Florida. As U.S. 29 passes through\nCharlotte it becomes Tyson St.\u2014a street wholly located within\nthe state of North Carolina. The two roadways in this case are not\nidentical, but they are partly identical, for Tyson St. is\nidentical to a proper part of U.S. 29. According to the temporal parts\ntheorist, the case of the statue and the clay is similar. Lump exists\nfor some period of time and then \u201cturns into\u201d David. If\nthe sculptor is unsatisfied with her work and squashes the statue,\nthen Lump\u2014but not David\u2014continues to exist, in which case\nDavid is nothing more than a proper temporal part of Lump.\n\nThere are, of course, various arguments for and against this view.\n(See the entry on\n temporal parts.)\n Here, we focus on the relevance of the doctrine to the puzzles of\nmaterial constitution and, in particular, to the challenges facing the\nconstitution view.\n\nThe impenetrability objection. The first problem for the\nconstitution view was that it allowed for two material objects to\nexist in the same place at the same time. The temporal parts theorist\navoids this objection for he will say that, whenever Lump and David\nexist, there is a single object that exactly occupies the relevant\nlocation\u2014a temporal part that is shared by both David and Lump.\nOf course, those two objects will be partly present at the\nsame location, but this is no more problematic than two roads being\npartly present at the same place by sharing a common road segment.\n\nThe extensionality objection. The second problem for the\nconstitution view was that it allowed for two objects to be composed\nof all the same parts. The temporal parts theorist avoids this problem\nin the case of the statue and the lump, since he will say that those\nobjects share some, but not all, of the same temporal parts. Of\ncourse, those objects will have all the same parts when they both\nexist, but this is no more problematic than two roads sharing all\nthe same parts where they overlap.\n\nThe grounding objection. The third challenge for the\nconstitution theorist was to identify a ground for the different\nfeatures of coinciding objects. The same challenge can be put to the\nfriend of temporal parts. In the case of the statue and the clay, for\nexample, we have two objects that are perfect duplicates whenever they\nboth exist\u2014in virtue of what, then, do they differ with respect\nto their temporal properties, persistence conditions, and so on? The\ntemporal parts theorist could follow the constitution theorist in\nclaiming that the relevant objects differ in kind, for example, in\nvirtue of their historical properties or he could simply insist that\nthe difference in kind is grounded in the fact that the two objects\nhave different temporal parts (Wasserman 2002).\n\nThe anthropic objection. The last worry for the constitution\nview was that it postulated an unexplained correspondence between the\nsortal terms in our language and the kinds of objects in the world.\nThe temporal parts theorist avoids this worry as well. On the standard\nfour-dimensionalist picture, persisting objects are ultimately\ncomposed of instantaneous temporal parts and, for any collection of\nthese parts, there is a further object that they compose (Quine 1960,\np. 171). For example, there is an object composed of all and only the\ntemporal parts of David when that statue is indoors. This\nwould be what we earlier called an \u201cinstatue\u201d. There is\nalso an object composed of all and only the temporal parts of David\nwhen that statue is in the light. This is what we earlier\ncalled a \u201clitstatue\u201d. In this way, the temporal parts\ntheorist finds a place for all of the objects introduced earlier, and\nthereby avoids an implausible correlation between the sortal terms of\nour language and the kinds of objects in the world. (Of course, some\npeople think that this solution is worse than the problem\u2014see,\nfor example, Markosian 1998, p. 228, Elder 2008: 440, and Korman 2015:\nChapter 4.)\n\nUnfortunately, the temporal parts solution cannot be extended to the\ncase Lumpl and Goliath since those objects exist at all of the same\ntimes and thus share the same temporal parts. The four-dimensionalist\nwho accepts extensionality will therefore be forced to conclude that\nLumpl is identical to Goliath. This, however, is problematic, since\nthose objects seem to differ in their modal properties. Lumpl, for\nexample, could survive beings squashed, whereas Goliath could not.\n\nThe most popular reply to this worry is due to David Lewis (1971,\n1986), who defends a counterpart theory of de re\nmodal ascriptions. According to Lewis, ordinary objects like Goliath\nexist in only one possible world, but have counterparts at\nother worlds that serve as truth-makers for de re modal\nascriptions. Crucially, whether or not something counts as a\ncounterpart of Goliath (for example) will depend on what respects of\nsimilarity are at issue. Since the name \u2018Goliath\u2019 is associated with\nthe kind statue, a sentence like \u201cGoliath could survive being\nsquashed\u201d will normally be true (relative to a context) just in case\nGoliath has some statue-counterparts that survive squashing\n(i.e., some counterparts that survive squashing as statues).\nPresumably, there are no such counterparts, so that sentence will\nexpress a falsehood. Meanwhile, the name \u2018Lumpl\u2019 is\nassociate with kind lump of clay, so a sentence like \u201cLumpl\ncould survive being squashed\u201d will be true just in case Lumpl has a\nlump-counterpart that survives being squashed. Presumably,\nthere are some such objects at other worlds, so that sentence will\nexpress a truth. Moreover, this will be the case even if the temporal\nparts theorist is correct and a single object is picked out by both\n\u2018Lumpl\u2019 and \u2018Goliath\u2019. The key point is that\nthe phrase \u2018could survive being squashed\u2019 expresses different\nproperties when combined with these names, so Leibniz\u2019s Law has\nno application. (For objections to counterpart theory, see Fara and\nWilliamson 2005.)\n\nOne worry for this response is that it cannot account for apparent\nnon-modal differences between Lumpl and Goliath. For example, Kit Fine\n(2003) argues that Lumpl, but not Goliath, might be\nwell-made, and that Goliath, but not Lumpl, might be\nRomanesque. Since these are not modal ascriptions,\ncounterpart theory has no application. As a result, it is unclear what\nthe temporal parts theorist is to say about apparent differences of\nthis sort. (For more on this issue, see the exchange between Fine\n2006, Frances 2006, and King 2006.)\n4. Eliminativism\n\nThe simplest way of avoiding the puzzles of material constitution is\nto deny the existence of some of the objects that give rise to those\nproblems. For example, if one claims that there are no such things as\nstatues and lumps of clay, then there is no threat of having a statue\nand a lump of clay in the same place at the same time.\n\nThis kind of eliminativism is often associated with Peter Unger\n(1979), who (at one time) defended the thesis of mereological\nnihilism. Nihilism is the view that there are there are no\ncomposite objects (i.e., there are no objects with proper\nparts\u2014only atoms exist). On this view, there are no statues,\nanimals or any other macroscopic object made up out of smaller parts.\nSince the nihilist denies the existence of statues in general, he will\ndeny the existence of the particular statue, David. Hence, he will\nreject the very first premise of the original argument for coincident\nobjects. He will also reject the second premise of that argument,\nsince he will deny the existence of the relevant lump. (Note that\nUnger\u2019s use of \u2018nihilism\u2019 differs slightly from its\ncurrent meaning\u2014see van Inwagen 1990, p. 73.)\n\nThe nihilist makes two main claims, both of which can be challenged.\nFirst, there is the negative thesis that there are no composite\nobjects and no statues in particular. The most common reaction to this\nclaim is an incredulous stare. For many, the existence of composite\nobjects is a Moorean fact, more certain than any premise that could be\nused to argue against it. The nihilist may reply that we can make\nsense of our statue-talk by paraphrasing it into claims about simples.\nFor example, instead of saying that there is a statue on the table, we\ncan say that there are some simples arranged \u201cstatuewise\u201d\non top of some other simples arranged \u201ctablewise\u201d.\nSimilarly for other talk of statues, ships, and other composite\nobjects. (For more on this paraphrasing strategy, see van Inwagen\n1990, chapter 10. For worries, see O\u2019Leary-Hawthorne and Michael\n1996, Uzquiano 2004b, and McGrath 2005.) This brings us to the\nnihilist\u2019s positive thesis that there are material simples. This\nclaim can also be challenged. After all, it was once thought that\nchemical atoms were fundamental particles, until the discovery of\nprotons and neutrons. And it was thought that protons and neutrons\nwere mereological simples, until the discovery of quarks. One might\nthink it is possible for this process goes on without limit, in which\ncase our world would be gunky (i.e., it would have no simples\nas proper parts). The problem is that this possibility is inconsistent\nwith nihilism, which seems to imply that a material world must contain\nmaterial simples (Sider 1993, Zimmerman 1996, Schaffer 2003).\n\nA second version of eliminativism is associated with Peter van Inwagen\n(1990), who defends the view that living objects are the only\ncomposite objects. This view is closely related to nihilism, but has\none notable advantage\u2014it allows for the existence of human\npersons. For example, in the case of Dion and Theon, van Inwagen will\nsay that Dion exists at the beginning of the story, since the activity\nof the relevant simples constitutes a life (the life of Dion). But van\nInwagen will deny that Theon exists, for the activity of the relevant\nsimples only constitutes a part of Dion\u2019s life at that\ntime. Of course, the activity of those same simples constitutes a life\nafter Dion\u2019s right foot is removed, at which point the simples\ncome to compose Dion. More generally, van Inwagen denies the existence\nof what he calls \u201carbitrary undetached parts\u201d:\n\nThe Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached Parts (DAUP): For every\nmaterial object m, time t, and regions\nr1 and r2, if m\noccupies r1 at t and\nr2 is a sub-region of r1, then\nthere is a part of m that occupies r2 at\nt. (cf. van Inwagen 1981, p. 123)\n\n\nLet m = Dion, t = a pre-operation time,\nr1 = the region occupied by Dion at t,\nand r2 = the region corresponding to all of Dion\nexcept for his right foot at t. If DAUP were correct, then\nTheon would exist, for it would just be the proper part of Dion that\noccupies r2 at t. Van Inwagen denies the\nexistence of Theon, so he rejects the general principle as well. (For\nmore on DAUP and material constitution, see van Inwagen 1981, Olson\n1995, and Parsons 2004.)\n\nVan Inwagen\u2019s version of eliminativism is subject to the same\nobjections raised against nihilism, but it also faces problems of its\nown. Here is one worry. There are borderline cases where it is vague\nwhether or not the activity of some simples constitutes a life\n(consider, for example, the question of when, exactly, a person\u2019s life\ncomes to an end). But, if it is vague whether the activity of some\nsimples constitutes a life then, according to van Inwagen, it is vague\nhow many objects exist. But it cannot be vague how many objects exist,\nsince cardinality claims can be made in a part of language where\nnothing is vague. Suppose, for example, that there are exactly\none-million simples and that it is vague whether or not the activity\nof those simples constitutes a life. Now consider the numerical\nsentence that asserts the existence of (at least) one-million and one\nobjects. (A numerical sentence is a first-order sentence\nasserting the existence of some objects. For example, the numerical\nsentence that there exist at least two objects is:\n\u2203x\u2203y(x \u2260 y).) If\nvan Inwagen is correct, then it is indeterminate whether or not the\nrelevant numerical sentence is true, in which case one of the\nconstituent expressions\u2014\u2018\u2203\u2019,\n\u2018x\u2019, \u2018y\u2019, \u2018~\u2019,\n\u2018=\u2019\u2014must be vague. Yet philosophers have claimed\nthat the terms of first-order logic do not admit of borderline cases.\n(For a more detailed presentation of this argument, see Lewis 1986,\npp. 212\u2013213, Sider 2001, pp. 120\u2013132, and section 2.2 of\nthe entry on\n ordinary objects.\n For potential replies, see Hirsch 2002b, Liebesman and Eklund 2007,\nand van Inwagen 1990, Chapter 13.)\n\nA third version of eliminativism is often associated with Roderick\nChisholm (1973), who defends the doctrine of mereological\nessentialism: for any x and y, if x is\na part of y then, necessarily, y exists only if\nx is a part of y. This doctrine is an\n\u201celiminativist\u201d view insofar as it denies the existence of\nmereologically ductile objects. For example, in the Ship of Theseus\ncase it is natural to think that there is a ship which survives the\nreplacement of at least some of its parts. The essentialist\u2019s\nresponse to the paradox is to deny this apparent truism. In the same\nway, the Debtor\u2019s Paradox and the Puzzle of Deon and Theon only\narise on the assumption that human persons can gain and lose parts.\nThe essentialist solves these puzzles by rejecting this assumption.\nThe Puzzle of the Statue and the Clay remains problematic, however,\nfor that example involved a change in shape, rather than a change in\nparts. In order to respond to this puzzle, the essentialist must\nendorse an additional principle: for any xs and for any\ny, if the xs compose y then, necessarily,\nthe xs exist only if they compose y. This thesis\nsays that the whole is essential to the parts, so that whenever you\nhave the same parts, you have the same whole. The defender of this\nthesis will say that, in our earlier case, Lump exists on both Monday\nand Tuesday, for the same clay parts are there on both days. The same\nis true of David. The parts that compose David on Tuesday are present\non Monday, in which case the first premise of the earlier argument is\nfalse\u2014David did exist on Monday. In that case, the\ndefender of mereological essentialist is free to identify David and\nLump and thereby avoid any commitment to coincident objects.\n\nViewed from one perspective, the essentialist\u2019s picture can seem\nintuitive. When one rearranges the dining room furniture, one does not\nbring new furniture into existence\u2014one simply brings existing\nfurniture into a new arrangement. In the same way, rearranging the\nmaterial contents of the universe does not bring new material objects\ninto existence\u2014it simply puts existing objects into new\narrangements. Thus, when the artist sculpts the lump of clay she gives\nthat object a new form, but does not create a new object. Viewed from\nanother perspective, however, this picture seems completely absurd,\nfor it implies that if we annihilate a single particle of David, the\nentire statue will be destroyed. More frightening still, if we\nannihilate a single particle from your body, then you will no\nlonger exist. The mereological essentialist may reply that, if we were\nto annihilate a particle from David, there would still be a statue\nleft in its place\u2014call it David*. David* would not be\nidentical to David, but it would be very similar. For\nexample, it would have roughly the same mass, the same shape, and the\nsame location. In Chisholm\u2019s terminology, this would be a\n\u201cstatue-successor\u201d of David, and the existence of this\nsuccessor gives us a loose sense in which \u201cthe statue\u201d\nsurvives. Here is a second worry for the essentialist, focusing on the\nidea that the whole is essential to the parts. Imagine that the artist\nwho sculpted David becomes dissatisfied with her work and squashes the\nstatue while preserving all the bits of clay. If the whole is\nessential to the parts, then it would follow that David (the thing\nthat was previously composed of those parts) still exists. But this\nseems absurd\u2014statues cannot survive being squashed. We get an\nequally absurd result in the opposite direction. David\u2019s parts\nexisted prior to the sculpting, so David itself existed prior to the\nsculpting. But how can a statue exist before it is sculpted? The\neliminativist might reply that the thing which is (currently) a statue\nexisted prior to the sculpting, but it was not (then) a statue. In\nthis sense, at least, we can say that the statue did not exist prior\nto sculpting. Similarly, the thing which is (currently) a statue may\nsurvive being squashed, but it will not (then) be a statue. So, in\nthat sense, the statue will not survive the squashing. (For more\ndetails on this paraphrasing strategy, see Chisholm 1976, chapter\n3.)\n5. Dominant Kinds\n\nIn the previous section, we examined various ways of resisting the\nfirst premise of our original argument\u2014the claim that\nDavid did not exist on Monday. Let us now turn our attention\nto the second premise: Lump did exist on Monday.\nEliminativists like Unger and van Inwagen will reject this premise,\nsince they deny the existence of objects like Lump. But there are\nother accounts that reject this premise as well. One such theory is\nthe dominant kind view defended by Michael Burke (1994,\n1997a, 1997b).\n\nBurke begins with the assumption that there is a single object present\non Tuesday. For the moment, let us call this object \u201cRex\u201d.\nBurke assumes that Rex is both a lump of clay and a statue. This is a\nperfectly natural assumption, but it is also problematic. As we have\nseen, kinds are associated with different persistence conditions. For\nexample, unlike the kind statue, the kind lump of\nclay is associated with the property of being able to survive\nsquashing. Now consider the following principle: for any object\no and kind K, if o is a K, then\no has the persistence conditions associated with K.\n(Burke 1994, p. 598) If this principle is correct, then we have a\nproblem. Rex is both a lump of clay and a statue, so the principle\ntells us that it is able to survive squashing and that it is not.\nBurke concludes that the proposed principle is false\u2014it is\npossible for an object to be a K without having the\npersistence conditions associated with that kind. In particular, Burke\nclaims that Rex is a statue and a lump of clay, but it only has the\npersistence conditions associated with one of those kinds. Which one?\nBurke answers that, in general, an object has the persistence\nconditions associated with its dominant kind. What is a\ndominant kind? Burke answers that, in general, an object\u2019s\ndominant kind is the kind that \u201centails possession of the widest\nrange of properties\u201d (Burke 1994, p. 607). For example, if\nsomething is a lump of clay, then it must have certain\nphysical properties. If something is a statue, on the other\nhand, then it must have both physical and aesthetic\nproperties. In this sense, statue entails a wider range of\nproperties than lump of clay. Hence, statue\ndominates lump of clay. Rex therefore has the persistence\nconditions associated with the kind statue. Rex, in other\nwords, is just David. What about Lump? In the original story, the name\n\u2018Lump\u2019 is introduced for the lump of clay that exists on\nMonday. At that point there was no statue, so Lump\u2019s dominant\nkind is simply lump of clay. Let us now introduce the name\n\u2018Lump*\u2019 for the lump of clay that exists on Tuesday. The\nlump of clay that exists on Tuesday is also a statue (Lump* is David,\ni.e., Rex), so Lump*\u2019s dominant kind is statue. Hence,\nLump \u2260 Lump*. On Burke\u2019s view, the process of sculpting a\nlump of clay into a statue destroys one object (a mere lump of clay)\nand replaces it with another (a statue). The resulting statue is also\na lump of clay, but it is numerically distinct from the lump of clay\nwith which we began. Burke concludes that Lump exists on Monday, but\ndoes not exist on Tuesday. Hence, the second premise of the original\nargument is false.\n\nThe dominant kinds view has several advantages over the eliminativist\naccounts. Most notably, the dominant kinds view recognizes the\nexistence of ordinary objects like statues and lumps of clay and\nallows for these objects to gain and lose parts. However, some of the\nobjections raised in previous sections apply to Burke\u2019s view as\nwell. For example, the anthropic objection from section 2 can also be\nraised against the dominant kinds view (Sider 2001, p. 165). In\naddition, the view faces problems of its own.\n\nFirst, there is the objection from commonsense. According to Burke,\nsculptors can destroy lumps of clay by doing nothing more than\nreshaping them in accordance with certain artistic intentions. In\nfact, given certain theories of what constitutes an artwork, the\nsculptor doesn\u2019t even have to do that much. Suppose that an\nartist takes a liking to a particular rock in his yard. He gives it\nthe title Rocky and invites art critics to admire his new\nwork of art. If this is all it takes to create an artpiece, then this\nis all it takes to destroy a rock. After all, the rock at the\nbeginning of the story has piece of rock as its dominant\nkind, while the rock at the end has piece of art as its\ndominant kind. Hence, the latter rock is numerically distinct from the\nformer\u2014the original rock is no more. This seems absurd. Burke\nreplies by appealing to ambiguity (1994, 596\u20137). According to\nhim, \u2018the rock\u2019 could denote the rock (a singular\nobject) or the rocky stuff (the matter that constitutes that\nobject). On the first reading, the rock from the beginning of the\nstory is not the same as the rock at the end (since there is\na new dominant kind). But, on the second reading, the rock from the\nbeginning of the story is the same as the rock at the end\n(since it is the same matter throughout). Burke claims that this is\nenough to satisfy the demands of commonsense. (For more on mass terms\nand the distinction between stuff and things, see the entry on\n the metaphysics of mass expressions.)\n\nA second problem concerns Burke\u2019s account of dominance. Burke\nclaims that one kind dominates another when it entails a wider range\nof properties. This seems to get the current case correct, for there\nis a natural sense in which statue entails a wider range of\nproperties than lump of clay. But other cases are less clear.\nTake, for example, the case of a performance artist who poses his own\nbody to form a statue. The relevant object is both a person and a\nstatue. The kind statue entails having certain aesthetic\nproperties, but does not entail having any mental properties. The kind\nperson arguably entails having certain mental properties, but\ndoes not entail having any aesthetic properties. But, in that case,\nneither kind dominates the other, so Burke\u2019s account seems\nincomplete. (For further discussion of this worry, see Rea 2000.)\n\nA final problem for the dominant kinds view is that it cannot be\nextended to all cases of constitution. For example, in the Ship of\nTheseus case, we seem to have two ships in the same place at the same\ntime. Since there is a single kind at issue in that case, the\nquestion of dominance does not arise and Burke\u2019s account cannot\nhelp. (For further examples of this kind, see Fine 2000.)\n6. Relative Identity\n\nIn the previous two sections, we discussed various ways of challenging\nthe first two premises of the argument for coincident entities. Let us\nnow turn our attention to the third and final premise: If David\ndid not exist on Monday and Lump did exist on Monday, then David is\nnot identical to Lump. The premise follows from Leibniz\u2019s\nLaw: for any x and y, if x is identical to\ny, then x and y share all of the same\nproperties. The denial of Leibniz\u2019s Law therefore provides one\nway of resisting the final premise of the argument.\n\nThe denial of Leibniz\u2019s Law is sometimes associated with Peter\nGeach (1962, 1967), who defends a view called the relative\nidentity theory. Geach\u2019s central thesis is that there is no\nrelation of absolute identity\u2014identity is always relative to\na kind. Thus, we can say that David is the same\nstatue as Lump and we can say that David is the same lump\nof clay as Lump, but it makes no sense to say that David is the\nsame as Lump simpliciter. The consequent of the third premise\nis therefore nonsense, like saying \u2018David is not taller\nthan\u2019. More generally, Geach rejects the standard formulation of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law as incomplete, since it includes a non-relativized\nidentity predicate. In this way, the relative identity theorist is\nable to block the third step of the argument for coincident\nobjects.\n\nGeach makes many interesting claims about the behavior of relative\nidentity relations. For example, he claims that it is possible for\na to be the same K as b, but not the same\nK*, where \u2018K\u2019 and\n\u2018K*\u2019 are sortal terms denoting distinct kinds.\nTake, for example, the Debtor\u2019s Paradox. In that case, we have\nan earlier portion of matter, M1, and a later portion of\nmatter M2. According to Geach, M1 is not the\nsame portion of matter as M2, but it is the same person. In\nthis way, he is able to allow for the persistence of persons through\nchanges in parts. (See the entry on\n relative identity\n for more details.)\n\nThe relative identity theorist may deny the standard formulation of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law, but there is significant pressure to accept\nsome version of that principle since it seems to capture a\ncentral fact about identity. An obvious suggestion is to offer a\nrelativized version of Leibniz\u2019s Law: for any x and\ny, if x is the same K as y, then x\nand y share all of the same properties (where \u2018K\u2019\nis a sortal denoting a kind). If Geach\u2019s relative identity\nrelations do not conform to this law, one might worry that they are\nnot identity relations at all. And here we have a potential\nproblem. Take the case of David and Lump. As we have seen, some\nphilosophers want to say that David is both a statue and a lump of\nclay (it is not a mere lump of clay, since it is also a\nstatue, but it is still a lump of clay). Lump is obviously a lump of\nclay. Since there is only one lump of clay on Tuesday, David must be\nthe same lump of clay as Lump. But then, by the relativized version of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law, David and Lump must share all of the same\nproperties. This, once again, seems false. Lump existed on Monday, but\nDavid did not, so there is at least one property that Lump has and\nDavid lacks. In response, the relative identity theorist might appeal\nto another component of Geach\u2019s view. Geach suggests that proper\nnames are always associated with kinds. For example,\n\u2018David\u2019 is associated with the kind statue and\n\u2018Lump\u2019 is associated with the kind lump of clay.\nTaking a cue from the counterpart theorist (section 3), the relative\nidentity theorist may go on to claim that this association creates\nopaque contexts when we ascribe modal properties. Take, for example,\nthe following pair of statements:\n\nLump existed on Monday.\nDavid existed on Monday.\n\n\nThe relative identity theorist could say that (1) is true if and only\nif there was a lump of clay on Monday which is the same lump\nof clay as Lump. (2), on the other hand, is true just in case there\nwas statue on Monday which is the same statue as David. Given\nthese truth conditions, (1) is true and (2) is false, for there was a\nlump of clay on Monday (the same lump of clay as Lump), but no statue.\nMore importantly, on this analysis the predicates in (1) and (2)\nexpress different properties, in which case the relativized version of\nLeibniz\u2019s Law has no application. So, one cannot move from (1)\nand the negation of (2) to the conclusion that Lump and David are\ndistinct lumps of clay.\n\nA second worry for Geach is that it seems as if the relative identity\ntheory cannot solve all of the puzzles with which we began. Take, once\nagain, the Ship of Theseus Puzzle. In that case, we have the original\nship of Theseus (A), the museum\u2019s ship (B), and the\ncustodian\u2019s ship (C). The problem is that B seems to be the same\nship as A, which seems to be the same ship as C. If the same ship\nas relation is transitive, we get the absurd conclusion that B is\nthe same ship as C. The relative identity theorist might deny\ntransitivity, of course, but this would give us another reason to\nsuspect that relativized identity relations are not really\nidentity relations at all (Gupta 1980).\n\nA third and final worry for Geach concerns his denial of absolute\nidentity. As many commentators have pointed out, this denial has\ndrastic implications for logic, semantics, and set theory. To take\njust one example, consider the set theorist\u2019s axiom of\nextensionality: for any sets A and B, if\nA and B have the same members, then A is\nthe same set as B. Let A be David\u2019s unit set\nand let B be Lump\u2019s unit set. Is A the same\nset as B? The relativist must reject this question as\nill-formed. It makes no sense to ask whether x and y\nare the same members, since this requires a notion of absolute\nidentity (intuitively, \u2018member\u2019 does not denote a genuine\nkind, so \u2018same member as\u2019 does not express a relative\nidentity relation). As a result, the relative identity theorist must\ndeny extensionality, which throws set theory into jeopardy (Hawthorne\n2004).\n7. Deflationism\n\nImagine a debate between two friends over whether or not boats are\nships. One party points to a rowboat and says, \u201cThat boat is a\nship. After all, a ship is a vessel that floats on water and the\nrowboat is obviously a vessel that floats on water.\u201d The second\nparty disagrees: \u201cA ship is a sufficiently large vessel\nthat floats on water and the rowboat is not sufficiently large. So the\nboat is not a ship.\u201d Clearly, there is something defective about\nthis debate. First, there are two \u201ccandidate meanings\u201d for\nthe predicate \u2018ship\u2019\u2014namely a vessel that floats\non water and a sufficiently large vessel that floats on\nwater. Second, neither of these candidate meanings is more\n\u201cnatural\u201d than the other\u2014unlike \u2018water\u2019\nor \u2018electron\u2019, the predicate \u2018ship\u2019 does not\ncorrespond to a natural kind in the world. Third, the two parties to\nthe debate agree on all of the \u201cnon-ship\u201d facts\u2014in\nparticular, both parties agree that the rowboat is a vessel, that it\nfloats on water, and that it is relatively small in size. Given these\npoints, it is tempting to say that the two parties agree on all of the\nfacts and that their dispute is merely verbal. Note\nthat this conclusion is consistent with the view that one of the\nparties is actually mistaken. Suppose, for example, that semantic\nexternalism is correct and the meanings of our terms are\ndetermined, in part, by overall use (see the entry on\n externalism about mental content).\n In that case, the first party to our debate is presumably mistaken,\nsince English-speakers do not use the term \u2018ship\u2019 for rowboats. Still,\nthere is a sense in which the debate is verbal, for there is a\npossible language (\u201cEnglish*\u201d) that (a) employs a\ndifferent, equally natural meaning for \u2018ship\u2019, (b) is\nadequate for describing all of the facts, and (c) is such that the\nfirst party\u2019s statements would be true in that language. Thus,\nwe might say that the real dispute between the two parties is over\nwhether or not English is English*. And that is clearly a verbal\ndispute.\n\nSome philosophers have suggested that the debate over material\nconstitution is defective in exactly the same way. There is no genuine\ndispute between Lewis and Unger, for example, over whether or not\nstatues exist. Both parties agree on all of the relevant\nfacts\u2014e.g., that there are simples arranged statuewise. And both\nparties agree that there are two possible languages\n(\u201cLewis-English\u201d and \u201cUnger-English\u201d) where\nthe sentence \u201cStatues exist\u201d comes out true in one and\nfalse in the other. So the only disagreement is over whether English\nis Lewis-English or Unger-English. In other words, the debate is\nmerely verbal. This kind of deflationist view is often\nassociated with Rudolf Carnap (1950), Hilary Putnam (1987) and, more\nrecently, Eli Hirsch (2002a, 2002b, 2005). The issues raised by\ndeflationism are extremely complicated; here, we will limit ourselves\nto a few initial observations. (For a longer introduction to these\nissues, see Chalmers, Manley, and Wasserman 2009. For an extended\ndefense of deflationism, see Thomasson 2015.)\n\nIn the imagined dispute, we know exactly what the disputed term is\n(\u2018ship\u2019) and exactly what the relevant candidate meanings\nare (a vessel that floats on water and a sufficiently\nlarge vessel that floats on water). In the actual dispute between\nLewis and Unger, matters are not so clear. One might suspect that the\ndisputed term in this case is the predicate \u2018statue\u2019, but\nit turns out to be fairly difficult to specify the relevant candidate\nmeanings. For example, we might say that, in Lewis-English,\n\u2018statue\u2019 simply means a collection of simples arranged\nstatuewise. Whether or not that is a plausible interpretation of\nwhat Lewis means depends in part on the meaning of\n\u2018collection\u2019 (Sider 2009, pp. 388\u201390). In any case,\nit is even more difficult to specify an appropriate candidate meaning\nfor \u2018statue\u2019 in Unger-English. More importantly, even if\nwe are able to specify the relevant candidate meanings, we will not\nhave succeeded in showing that the general dispute between Lewis and\nUnger is verbal, for the dispute can be brought out without using the\npredicate \u2018statue\u2019 (or any non-logical predicate, for that\nmatter). Consider, for example, a world that contains one-million\nsimples arranged statuewise and nothing else. And consider the\nnumerical sentence (see section 4) which asserts the existence of at\nleast one-million and one things. Lewis and Unger will disagree over\nthe truth of that sentence. But that sentence contains only logical\nvocabulary. Hence, if the two parties are really talking past each\nother, then they must assign different meanings to one or more of the\nlogical constants.\n\nThe most plausible suggestion is that Lewis and Unger assign (or, at\nleast, intend to assign) different meanings to the existential\nquantifier, \u2018\u2203\u2019 (as well as quantificational phrases\nlike \u2018there are\u2019, \u2018there is\u2019, and\n\u2018some\u2019). And, indeed, this is where deflationists have\nfocused their attention. Putnam, for example, writes that \u201c[T]he\nlogical primitives themselves, and in particular the notions of object\nand existence, have a multitude of different uses rather than one\nabsolute \u2018meaning\u2019\u2009\u201d (1987, p. 71). This\nthesis\u2014that there are many meanings for the existential\nquantifier that are equally natural and equally adequate for\ndescribing all the facts\u2014is often referred to as \u201cthe\ndoctrine of quantifier variance\u201d (Hirsch 2002b). What exactly\nare the candidate meanings in question? Once again, matters are not so\nclear. Lewis could, of course, simply interpret Unger to be using a\nrestricted quantifier that ranges only over simples. On that\ninterpretation, Unger speaks truthfully when he utters the sentence\n\u201cStatues do not exist\u201d, since there are no statues among the simples.\nThe problem with this interpretation is that it seems manifestly\nimplausible, given that Unger will insist that his quantifiers are to\nbe understood as unrestricted. Even more worrying is the question of\nhow Unger is supposed to interpret Lewis. He cannot, for example, say\nthat Lewis is using a less restrictive quantifier, for that would be\nto say that there are things (that Lewis\u2019s quantifier ranges\nover) that do not exist (by Unger\u2019s own lights). Unger could,\nperhaps, take a more holistic approach and interpret Lewis\u2019s\nassertion of \u2018Statues exist\u2019 to mean there are some simples\narranged statuewise. More generally, Unger could interpret Lewis\nby replacing singular quantifiers over composites with plural\nquantifiers over simples, and by replacing each predicate of\ncomposites with an irreducibly plural predicate of simples. Once\nagain, we should expect protest\u2014Lewis will reject the proposed\ntranslation and insist that he is using singular quantification when\nhe asserts the sentence \u2018Statues exist\u2019.\n\nThese initial observations bring out one disanalogy between the\nontological dispute and paradigm verbal disputes. In the earlier\nargument over whether or not boats are ships, the proposed\ntranslations are friendly, since the first party will admit\nthat he uses \u2018ship\u2019 to mean a vessel that floats on\nwater and the second will grant that he uses \u2018ship\u2019\nto mean a sufficiently large vessel that floats on water.\nGiven this disambiguation, the dispute will evaporate. The\ndeflationist\u2019s proposals are instead hostile, for\nneither Lewis nor Unger will accept the deflationist interpretation\noffered by his opponent (Sider 2009, section 5). This does not mean\nthat the ontologists\u2019 debate is non-verbal, but it does mean\nthat the issues involved here are more complicated than those in\nparadigm verbal disputes.
