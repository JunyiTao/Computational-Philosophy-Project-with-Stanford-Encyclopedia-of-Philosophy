    "main_text": "Rights and Consistency\n3. Rights and Consistency\n\n\nTo many of its critics, reverse discrimination was simply\nincoherent. When \u201cthe employers and the schools favor\nwomen and blacks,\u201d objected Lisa Newton, they commit the same\ninjustice perpetrated by Jim Crow discrimination. \u201cJust as the\nprevious discrimination did, this reverse discrimination violates the\npublic equality which defines citizenship\u201d (Newton 1973,\n 310).[5]\n\n\nWilliam Bennett and Terry Eastland likewise saw racial preferences\nas in some sense illogical:\n\n\nTo count by race, to use the means of numerical equality to achieve\nthe end of moral equality, is counterproductive, for to count by race\nis to deny the end by virtue of the means. The means of race counting\nwill not, cannot, issue in an end where race does not \n matter (Eastland and Bennett 1979,\n 149).[6]\n\n\n\nWhen Eastland and Bennett alluded to those who favored using race to\nget to a point where race doesn\u2019t count, they had in mind specifically\nthe Supreme Court\u2019s Justice Blackmun who, in the famous 1978\nBakke case (discussed below), put his own view in just those\nsimple terms. For Blackmun, the legitimacy of racial preferences was\nto be measured by how fast using them moves us toward a society where\nrace doesn\u2019t matter (a view developed in subtle detail by the\nphilosopher Richard Wasserstrom in Wasserstrom 1976). While the\ncritics of preferences claimed to find the very idea of using race to\nend racism illogical and incoherent, they also fell back on principle\nto block Blackmun\u2019s instrumental defense should it actually prove both\nreasonable and plausible. \u201cThe moral issue comes in classic\nform,\u201d wrote Carl Cohen. \u201cTerribly important\nobjectives\u2026appear to require impermissible means.\u201d  Cohen asked,\n\u201cmight we not wink at the Constitution this once\u201d and allow\npreferences to do their good work (Cohen 1995, 20)?  Neither he nor\nother critics thought so.  Principle must hold firm. \u201c[I]n the\ndistribution of benefits under the laws all racial\nclassifications are invidious\u201d (Cohen 1995, 52).\n\n\nBut what, exactly, is the principle\u2014constitutional or\nmoral\u2014that always bars the use of race as a means to\n\u201cterribly important objectives\u201d? Alan Goldman did more\nthan anyone in the early debate to formulate and ground a relevant\nprinciple. Using a contractualist framework, he surmised that rational\ncontractors would choose a rule of justice requiring positions to be\nawarded by competence. On its face, this rule would seem to preclude\nfilling positions by reference to factors like race and gender that\nare unrelated to competence. However, Goldman\u2019s\n\u201crule\u201d blocked preferences only under certain empirical\nconditions. Goldman explained the derivation of the rule and its\nconsequent limit this way:\n\n\nThe rule for hiring the most competent was justified as part of a\nright to equal opportunity to succeed through socially productive\neffort, and on grounds of increased welfare for all members of society.\nSince it is justified in relation to a right to equal opportunity, and\nsince the application of the rule may simply compound injustices when\nopportunities are unequal elsewhere in the system, the creation of more\nequal opportunities takes precedence when in conflict with the rule for\nawarding positions. Thus short-run violations of the rule are justified\nto create a more just distribution of benefits by applying the rule\nitself in future years. (Goldman 1979, 164\u2013165).\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, if \u201cterribly important\nobjectives\u201d having to do with\nequalizing opportunities in a system rife with unjust inequalities could in\nfact be furthered by measured and targeted reverse\ndiscrimination, justice wouldn\u2019t stand in the way. Goldman\u2019s principle\ndid not have the adamantine character Cohen and other critics sought\nin a bar to preferences. Where can such an unyielding principle be\nfound? I postpone further examination of this question until I discuss\nthe Bakke case, below, whose split opinions constitute an\nextended debate on the meaning of constitutional equality.\n",
