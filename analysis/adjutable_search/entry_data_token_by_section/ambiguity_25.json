    "main_text": "Philosophical Issues || Legal Interpretations\n5.5 Legal Interpretations\n\nOn the other hand, the facts about ambiguity can matter a great deal\nwhen it comes to determining policy, extension of law etc. The law is\nsensitive to this and makes certain division between ambiguities. For\nexample, the law divides between patent and latent ambiguity, where\nthe former roughly corresponds to a case where the meaning of a law is\nunclear, the latter to cases where the meaning is clear but applies\nequally well to highly disparate things. In effect, this is the\ndifference between ambiguity in sense and ambiguity in reference.\n\nU.S. Constitution scholars sometimes claim that the Constitution is\n\u2018ambiguous\u2019 at key points. A famous example of such an ambiguity is the\nsuccession of the vice president, where the framers stipulate\nthat:\n\n\nIn Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death,\nResignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the\nsaid Office, the same shall devolve on the Vice President, (Article 2,\nsection 1)\n\n\nThe clause is not clear as to what \u2018devolve\u2019 means.\n\nOf course, given what has been discussed, this looks to be more like a\ncase of under-specificity, or simply ignorance of a word\u2019s\nmeaning (in 1787), not ambiguity. As the distinction has no real legal\nrelevance in this case, it is ignored as it generally is in common\nparlance.\n",
