    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mathematics || Early mathematical works\n11.1 Early mathematical works\n\nBolzano began his mathematical investigations with a work in geometry\n(Bolzano 1804) and continued with publications in the area of\nanalysis. He essentially formulated the modern criterion of\nconvergence in his Purely Analytic Proof (Bolzano 1817, 11\nf.) already four years prior to Cauchy\u2019s Course\nd\u2019analyse (1821). This work already contains the so-called\nBolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which again occurs in Bolzano\u2019s\nposthumously edited Theory of Functions (Bolzano 1930, 28 f.,\nBGA IIA, 10/1: 47 f.). Here (Bolzano 1930, 66\u201370, 98 f., BGA\nIIA, 10/1: 79\u201382, 103) we find also for the first time an\nexample of a continuous and still non-differentiable function; for a\nlong time, Weierstrass had been regarded as the first one who\ndiscovered such functions, until historical justice was done by Karel\nRychl\u00edk\u2019s investigations.\n",
