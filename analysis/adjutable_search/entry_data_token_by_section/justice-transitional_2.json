    "main_text": "Introduction to Transitional Justice || Peace versus Justice\n1.2 Peace versus Justice\n\n\nPost war transitions are characterized by the co-existence of\npotentially conflicting, yet politically and morally important,\ngoals. As we have seen, some of these are about doing justice for past\nabuses, while others are concerned with consolidating stability and\ncreating functioning, competent institutions. The uneasy co-existence\nof these aims - the fact that they are all dearly held, and yet cannot\nquite be fully realized together\u2014points to a significant tension\nbetween considerations of justice and social utility after\nwar. Needless to say, this tension exists in ordinary political life\nas well. The friction between what is morally called for and the way\nin which leaders must sometimes act for the overall benefit of their\nsubjects has always been important to our understanding of\npolitics. Machiavelli articulates it most famously when he argues that\na Prince might have to learn how \u201cnot to be good\u201d in order\nto act in the best interest of his polity (Machiavelli, The\nPrince, Ch. 15).  Sartre provides the dramatic depiction and\ngives the problem its most familiar name in his play Dirty Hands. One\nof his protagonists puts it starkly: \u201cWell, I have dirty\nhands. Right up to the elbows. I've plunged them in filth and\nblood. But what do you hope? Do you think you can govern\ninnocently?\u201d (Sartre, \u201cDirty Hands,\u201d Act V).  The\nmost important contemporary philosophical treatment appears, of\ncourse, in Michael Walzer's famous article \u201cPolitical Action:\nThe Problem of Dirty Hands\u201d (Walzer 1973).  In transitional\ncontexts this tension is usually labeled the \u201cpeace versus\njustice\u201d dilemma (see, for example, Freeman 2010 and Mihai\n2010)\u2014denoting that the demands of quiet and stability may well\nrequire compromising the morally important demands of retributive\njustice and accountability. Thus, for example, it was wrong to allow\napartheid murderers to get away with murder during South Africa's\ntransition. But if they had been tried as war criminals, South Africa\nwould have most likely erupted into civil war. Similarly, it was wrong\nto bury Spain's history of violence for more than thirty years after\nthe end of Franco's dictatorship. But, had this history been excavated\nearlier, Spain may well have failed to develop into the liberal\ndemocracy it is today.\n Viewing the peace vs. justice dilemma as a variation of the\nproblem of dirty hands helps us better understand the nature of the\ntensions at play after war. Properly described, peace vs. justice is\nnot a debate between proponents of a Kantian commitment to full\nretributive justice and cynical realists who are willing, in the\ninfamous words of the Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, to \u201cdig\na hole and bury the past\u201d (quoted in Mydans 2010).  Rather, the\ntension is more properly viewed, like the problem of dirty hands, as a\nparadox: officials as well as citizens in transitional countries\nconcurrently hold two powerful yet often contradictory moral\nintuitions: that in order to establish a legitimate, functioning civil\nsociety one must do justice for the crimes of the past and that to\nsecure quiet, stability and a functioning government it is sometimes\nnecessary and morally acceptable to leave past crimes and past\ncriminals alone. An analogy to another such paradox may be helpful in\nillustrating the difference between a paradox and a debate. The\nproblem of moral luck famously delineated by Thomas Nagel and Bernard\nWilliams denotes a paradox about how we make judgments about praise\nand blame: we tend to think that people should be praised or blamed\nonly on the basis of what they can control, and yet we regularly\npraise and blame people on the basis of the results of their\nactions\u2014even if these are beyond the control of the agents\ninvolved (Nagel 1979 and Williams 1981). A drunk driver who got home\nsafely and a drunk driver who hit a child on the way home took the\nsame risk getting into their cars. The first intuition would require\ntreating them similarly.  The second recommends more severe punishment\nto the driver actually involved in an accident.\n\n\nA moral debate can, in principle, be settled by a superior set of\narguments. A paradox can only be described. Caught in the paradox\nbetween peace and justice we might end up emphasizing one kind of\nintuition over the other after war. But this is not the same as\nwinning a moral argument and doing away with a discredited\nposition. The Spaniards emphasized the need for stability over the\nneed for accountability for a period of thirty years. Then, when they\nwere confident enough that stability had been consolidated, they\nshifted their emphasis. The Rwandans, after conducting nominal\ncriminal trials in Tanzania, made a similar decision and cleared the\ndockets by means of their Gacaca courts. Rwanda is now more\nquiet and stable.  But such quiet, as commentators like Philip\nGourevitch have noted (see, most recently, Gourevitch 2009), is an\nuneasy one as long as survivors are resentful about failure to bring\nperpetrators to justice. Stated differently, there is no real\n\u201cdebate\u201d between peace and justice after war, as some\nscholars and NGOs claim, only a continuing negotiation that, at any\ngiven point, will lean towards one of these intuitions. The best we\ncan do is understand their co-equal status, settle on a policy that\nlies on the continuum between them, and constantly reevaluate.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the peace versus justice tension is merely a\nspecific manifestation of the problem of dirty hands, there is an\nimportant distinction that must be observed: while the tension between\njustice and social utility is part of the political life of any\nconsolidated democracy, it is central and definitive of political life\nduring transitions. In consolidated democracies, such tensions can be\nalleviated by legal institutions and traditions that embody\nconclusions about how to manage the requisite tradeoffs between\njustice and social utility (these include a constitution, a body of\naccepted constitutional jurisprudence, a respected high court with\npowers of judicial review, etc.). Part of the role of such\ninstitutions and traditions is to provide guidance about which\ntradeoffs would seem most justifiable given a comprehensive\ninterpretation of the state's legal and political history. But\ntransitional times are exactly the periods in which such institutions,\ntraditions, and interpretive principles are first being set out. When\nthe argument arose about abuses of executive power in the Unites\nStates following the September 11, 2001 attacks, that debate could\ntake place on the background of a history of executive power grabs and\nthe responses to them (Jefferson's requisitioning of funds for the\nmilitary without congressional approval and Lincoln's suspension of\nhabeas corpus during the civil war come to mind). In a\ntransitional context, that long and important political discussion is\nmissing.  More precisely, the very point of the transitional period is\nto set up the institutions and methods responsible for having that\ndebate. The upshot of this predicament is two fold: it is harder for\ntransitional societies to resolve peace versus justice decisions\nbecause the traditions and institutions so important for navigating\nthese questions are not yet present. At the same time, the very act of\ncreating of such institutions inevitably creates situations where\npeace and justice must clash: the need to quickly set up a competent\ncourt and police systems to allow for stable government may well\nrequire hiring administrators tainted during the tenure of the\nprevious regime; the need to attract foreign investors and maintain\npeace in the streets may require some compromises on the extent and\nlength of criminal proceedings against past perpetrators, and so\nforth.\n\n\nTo recap, the tension between peace and justice is especially\npronounced in transitional settings because creating the basic\ninstitutions of governance is more likely to raise it, and because the\nguidance available in settled context from the existence of such\ninstitutions is missing. To this dual explanation we should add that\nthe conflict between peace and justice is further heightened in\ntransitional situations because the political stakes are uniquely high\nduring such moments. If a transitional society cannot consolidate\npeace and functioning government, the very effort to create a decent\nnew state suffers shipwreck. This kind of fragility, where the entire\npolitical project is at stake, is more likely to float peace versus\njustice dilemmas than a specific crisis in a consolidated democracy.\nSuch localized crises typically implicate localized endeavors, not the\nexistence of the political system itself.\n",
