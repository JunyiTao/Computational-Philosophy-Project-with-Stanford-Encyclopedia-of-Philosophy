    "main_text": "Recognizing Cooper\u2019s Voice: A Woman Question and a Race Problem\n3. Recognizing Cooper\u2019s Voice: A Woman Question and a Race Problem\n\n\nThe historical neglect of Cooper\u2019s scholarship by philosophers\nrequires an extensive overview of Cooper\u2019s scholarly\nwritings. This section reintroduces A Voice from the\nSouth in order to advance Cooper\u2019s place, not only in\nAfrican American philosophy and Critical Philosophy of Race, but also\nin Feminist and Social and Political Philosophy. Voice\nis organized into two parts.  The first part, \u201cThe Colored\nWoman\u2019s Office\u201d, includes: \u201cOur Raison\nd\u2019\u00catre\u201d (1892); \u201cWomanhood: A Vital Element in\nthe Regeneration and Progress of a Race\u201d (1892); \u201cThe\nHigher Education of Women\u201d (1890\u20131891); \u201cWoman Versus the\nIndian\u201d (1891\u20131892); and \u201cThe Status of Women in\nAmerica\u201d(1892). The second part, \u201cRace and\nCulture\u201d features: \u201cHas America a Race Problem: If So, How\nCan it Best Be Solved?\u201d (1892); \u201cThe Negro as Presented in\nAmerican Literature\u201d (1892); \u201cWhat Are We Worth?\u201d\n(1892); and \u201cThe Gain from a Belief\u201d (1892). In this\ncollection of essays, several of which were originally delivered as\npublic speeches, Cooper argues that woman\u2019s experience in general\nand Black woman\u2019s experience in particular, places her in a\nunique position to have a distinctive voice, influence, and\ncontribution to make to her race, to the nation, and to the world more\nbroadly.\n\u201cOur Raison d\u2019\u00catre\u201d\n\n\nIn the short but powerful opening statement of A Voice from the\nSouth, \u201cOur Raison d\u2019\u00catre\u201d (1892) Cooper\nexplains that while the voice of the Negro (man) of the South has been\nbut a muffled chord, \u201cthe one mute and voiceless note has been\nthe sadly expectant Black woman\u2026\u201d (cited in The Voice of\nAnna Julia Cooper, hereafter VAJC, p. 51).  Using the analogy of a\ncourtroom trial, Cooper explains that the plaintiff\u2019s and\ndefendant\u2019s attorneys:\n \n\n\u2026have analyzed and dissected, theorized and\nsynthesized with sublime ignorance or pathetic misapprehension of\ncounsel from the black client. One important witness has not yet been\nheard from. The summing up of evidence deposed, and the charge to the\njury have been made\u2014but no word from the Black Woman. \n(VAJC, 51)\n\n \n\nCooper underscores how the Black [male] client, the muffled voice,\nhas at least been consulted, even if only with \u201cignorance\u201d\nand \u201cmisapprehension.\u201d But the \u201cone important\nwitness,\u201d i.e. the Black woman, has been rendered mute and\nvoiceless. Cooper asserts that the white man cannot speak to Black\nmen\u2019s experiences and furthermore, that Black men cannot speak to\nBlack women\u2019s experiences. She elaborates on this position in\n\u201cWomanhood, A Vital Element in the Regeneration and Progress of\na Race.\u201d\n\u201cWomanhood: A Vital Element in the Regeneration and Progress of a Race\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cWomanhood: A Vital Element in the Regeneration and\nProgress of a Race\u201d (1886) Cooper astutely addresses intersecting\nissues of race, gender, and society\u2014including intra-group\nracial politics, intra-group gender politics, and the professed ideals\nof American society. Her observations speak directly to debates\nin early African American philosophy and political thought around\nleadership, representation, and competing philosophies of race (for\nexample between Frederick Douglass\u2019s assimilationism and Martin\nDelany\u2019s separatism). Concerning intra-group racial\npolitics, Cooper asserts: \u201cThe Late Martin Delany, who was an\nunadulterated black man, used to say when honors fell upon him, that\nwhen he entered the council of kings the black race entered with him;\nmeaning, I suppose, that there was no discounting his race identity and\nattributing his achievements to some admixture of Saxon blood\u201d\n(VAJC 63). As a Black woman whose father is thought to have been\nher mother\u2019s white master, Cooper pushes back on two fronts.\n Not only can Delany not represent the whole simply by virtue of\nhis \u201cpure\u201d Black blood (unmixed with Saxon blood), but also\nbecause \u201cno man can represent the race\u201d (VAJC 63). It\nis in this context that Cooper made the now famous declaration that\n\u201cOnly the BLACK WOMAN can say \u2018when and where I enter, in\nthe quiet, undisputed dignity of my womanhood, without violence and\nwithout suing or special patronage, then and there the whole Negro\nrace enters with me\u201d (VAJC, 63). Here she\nproblematizes intra-group race and gender politics (specifically Black\nmale patriarchy) by insisting on the significance of the BLACK WOMAN in\ngeneral and laying claim to her particular significance as a Black\nwoman to the progress of the race\u2014this despite the admixture of Saxon\nblood, which in her case had been violently imposed by the legacy of\nslavery and the systematic sexual exploitation of Black women.\n\n\nThis analysis also provides a different background against which we\ncan read Cooper\u2019s description of the \u201ccolored girls\u201d\nof the South as: \u201cthat large, bright, fatally beautiful class\nthat stand shivering like delicate plantlets before the fury of\ntempestuous elements, so full of promise, yet so sure of destruction;\noften without a father to whom they dare apply the loving term, often\nwithout a stronger brother to espouse their cause and defend their\nhonor\u2026\u201d (VAJC 60). This passage not only underscores the\ndanger that Black girls and women faced in terms of sexual\nexploitation it also challenges some claims made by Alexander Crummell\nin a speech given three years earlier titled \u201cThe Black Woman of\nthe South: Her Neglects and Her Needs\u201d (1883).  Crummell makes a\nclear distinction between the colored people (whom he\ndescribes as those who were more educated and had better material\nconditions) and the negro population (whom he describes as\nintellectual starvelings).  Crummell attributes the affluence of\ncolored people to \u201cthe kindness and generosity of their white\nkindred\u2014white fathers and relatives (1883, 212).  Cooper is\nmaking the case that \u201ccolored\u201d people don\u2019t always\nhave a \u201cfather to whom they dare apply the loving term\u201d or\nthe kindness and generosity that having white kindred in selective\ninstances might have entailed. She also makes many references to the\nways in which white men protected \u201cEnglish womanhood\u201d and\nthe perceived lack of protection of Black women by Black men. When\nCooper asserts that snares and traps are set for the\n\u201cunprotected, untrained colored girl of the South,\u201d this\nis a reference to the sexual exploitation of Black girls and\nwomen (VAJC, 64).\n\n\nCooper emphasizes the honor of Black women, the idea that they\nshould occupy the role of mother or a family role (\u201cWoman,\nMother,\u2014your responsibility is one that might make the angels\ntremble\u2026The training of children\u2026\u201d [VAJC, 59]), and\ntheir responsibility for the moral education of Black youth and the\nregeneration of the race (\u201c\u2026the regeneration\u2026the\nretraining of the race\u2026must be the black woman\u201d [VAJC,\n62]). On this basis, some have argued that Cooper upholds American\nideals of womanhood and attempts to assimilate Black women to the\ncharacteristics often assigned to their white female\ncounterparts. Other examples of these ideals include\nCooper\u2019s claim that \u201cthe hope of our\ncountry\u2026rests\u2026on the home life and the influence of good\nwomen in those homes\u201d (VAJC, 55). And furthermore, that the\nresponsibility of woman and mother is to train children (VAJC,\n55). Cooper asserts: \u201c\u2026the position of woman in\nsociety determines the vital elements of its regeneration and\nprogress. Now that this is so on a priori grounds all\nmust admit. And this is not because woman is better or stronger\nor wiser than man, but\u2026because it is she who must first form the\nman by directing the earliest impulses of his character\u201d (VAJC\n59). These ideas about women\u2019s role in society,\nand/or civilization are comparable to those expressed by Thomas\nBabington Macaulay, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Martin Delany. \n\n\nMacaulay states, \u201c\u2018You may judge a nation\u2019s rank\nin the scale of civilization from the way they treat their\nwomen\u2019\u201d (VAJC, 55). Likewise Ralph Waldo Emerson\nclaims in \u201cAmerican Civilization\u201d:\n\n\nRight position of woman in the State is another index [of\ncivilization]. Poverty and industry with a healthy mind read very\neasily the laws of humanity, and love them: places the sexes in right\nrelations of mutual respect, and a severe morality gives that\nessential charm to woman which educates all that is delicate, poetic,\nand self-sacrificing, breeds courtesy and learning, conversation and\nwit, in her rough mate; so that I have thought it a sufficient\ndefinition of civilization to say, it is the influence of\ngood women.  (Emerson 1862)\n\n\n\nAnd in The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the\nColored People of the United States, Martin Delany declares,\n\u201cNo people are ever elevated above the condition of their\nfemales; hence, the condition of the mother\ndetermines the condition of the child. To know the position of a\npeople, it is only necessary to know the condition of their\nfemales; and despite themselves, they cannot rise above\ntheir level\u201d (Delany 1862, Chapter 24, Delany's \nemphasis).[6]\n\n\nIn addition to questions about gender, Cooper also interrogates ideals\nabout civilization and society. Some take Cooper\u2019s representation of\nAmerican society as an exemplar to be problematic,\nespecially when she looks down on other societies to\njustify this idealized standard. For example, she disparages the lifestyles\nof those in Turkey describing them as \u201cthe vilest of the vile,\nunprogressive, unambitious, and inconceivably low\u2026[Turkey is an]\neffete and immobile civilization\u201d (VAJC, 54). At times she\nglorifies American society and contrasts it with others. America\nis described as fresh, vigorous, progressive, elevating and inspiring,\n\u201cthe European bud and the American flower of civilization\u201d\n(VAJC, 54). She acknowledges we have not yet reached our ideal\nAmerican civilization, but assures her audience that \u201cAmerica is the\narena in which the next triumph of civilization is to be won\u201d\n(VAJC, 54). Cooper, however, does not completely romanticize the\nAmerican experience. Although she describes America as the\n\u201cflower of modern civilization\u201d she quickly notes that\nevery person in America is not able to fully experience this\n\u201cfloral\u201d aspect of American life. Cooper is very aware\nthat the Black experience in America is quite contrary to that of their\nwhite counterparts. But she is hopeful, perhaps over-optimistic,\nabout improving the status and experience of Blacks in America,\nstating, \u201cour satisfaction in American institutions rests not in\nthe fruition we now enjoy, but it springs rather from the possibilities\nand promise that are inherent in the system, though as yet, perhaps,\nfar in the future\u201d (VAJC, 54). Some might read this as\nCooper\u2019s attempt to hold America up to its professed ideals.\n\u201cThe Higher Education of Women\u201d\n \n\nIn the essay \u201cThe Higher Education of Women\u201d\n(1890\u20131891) Cooper provides a feminist argument for educating\nwomen. She examines the sentiments against the education of women\nin the early 1800s and provides a counter argument by referencing the\npositive impact that education has had in the lives of women who were\nable to attend colleges and pursue B. A. degrees as well as the\npositive impact on the world more broadly. According to Cooper, higher\neducation among women \u201c\u2026has given symmetry and\ncompleteness to the world\u2019s agencies\u201d (VAJC, 76). Thus, one of\nthe objectives of giving women access to higher education is to better\nequip them to influence humanity and to contribute to the questions,\nproblems and debates on the world stage. Cooper argues, \u201cthe\nfeminine factor can have its proper effect only through women\u2019s\ndevelopment and education so that she may fitly and intelligently\nstamp her force on the forces of her day\u2026\u201d (VAJC,\n78).\n\nCooper not only discusses the education of women in general, she\nis also acutely aware of the importance of education in the lives of\nBlack women and girls in particular. We are again reminded of the double\ndamnation of Black women, here in the area of education. While\nthere were constraints on educational opportunities for\nBlack people more generally, she brings attention to an attitude of\nresistance from Black men concerning academic development among\nwomen. Cooper admits, \u201cIt seems hardly a gracious thing to\nsay, but it strikes me as true, that while our men seem thoroughly\nabreast of the times in almost every other subject, when they strike\nthe woman question they drop back into sixteenth century logic\u201d\n(VAJC, 85). She notes that while Black men were aware of\nissues such as racial uplift, they largely ignored the problems\nspecific to (Black) women, i.e. the other \u201chalf\u201d of the\nrace that they were supposedly uplifting. This antiquated\nattitude is not limited to the higher education of adult women, but\nalso applied to young girls. Cooper exclaims, \u201c[G]ive\nthe girls a chance!\u2026 Let our girls feel that we expect more from\nthem than that they merely look pretty and appear well in\nsociety. Teach them that there is a race with special needs which\nthey and only they can help; that the world needs and is already asking\nfor their trained, efficient forces\u201d (VAJC, 86\u201387).\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Higher Education of Women\u201d we see Cooper\u2019s\ncommitment to the idea that women (and girls) have a voice that must be\nheard, they have an influence and contribution that must be made to the\nrace and to all of humanity. The attainment of higher education\nby women has produced well-equipped and thoughtful women \u201cwhom\nthe world has long awaited for in pain and anguish till there should be\nadded\u2026the complement of that masculine influence which has\ndominated it for fourteen centuries\u201d (VAJC, 73). Cooper expounds\non her theories about the unique mission and influence of women, namely\n\u201cto put in the tender and sympathetic cord in nature\u2019s\ngrand symphony, and counteract, or better, harmonize the diapason of\nmere strength and might\u201d (VAJC, 75). Cooper acknowledges\nthat with the (negative) influence of men, some women may strike a\n\u201cfalse note\u201d or parrot \u201ccold \nconceits\u201d\u2014however, Cooper insists that \u201cher \nheart is aglow with sympathy\nand loving kindness, and she cannot be true to her real self without\ngiving out these elements into the forces of the world\u201d (VAJC,\n75).\n\u201cWoman Versus the Indian\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cWoman Versus the Indian\u201d Cooper situates her\nphilosophy of rights intersectionally\u2014calling for the natural\ninherent rights of all people, or \u201cthe rights of humanity\u201d\nbut also specifying groups typically denied these rights such as\nBlacks, women, Indians (or Native Americans), and the poor. Just as\nshe is critical of Black men for their sexism, Cooper is equally\ncritical of white women\u2019s racism, particularly the racism expressed by\nwhite women\u2019s organizations that claimed to be tackling the oppression\nof all women. She challenges the tendency in the (white)\nwoman\u2019s movement to fight for (white) women\u2019s rights at the expense\nof, or instead of, others\u2019 rights. Taking a strong stand against all\nforms of oppression in \u201cWoman Versus the Indian\u201d\n(1891\u20131892) she declares:\n\n\nWoman should not even by inference, or for the sake of argument,\nseem to disparage what is weak. For woman\u2019s cause is the\ncause of the weak; and when all the weak shall have received their due\nconsideration, then woman will have her \u2018rights,\u2019 and the\nIndian will have his rights, and the Negro will have his rights, and\nall the strong will have learned at last to deal justly, to love mercy,\nand to walk humbly \u2026. (VAJC, 105)\n\n\n\nIn this essay, Cooper is responding in part to an essay by Ann Shaw\nwith the same title. Shaw\u2019s essay, as the title suggests,\nplaces the issue of women\u2019s rights against the rights of American\nIndians. It is noteworthy that Cooper rejects exclusionary\nreasoning (by inference or by argument) stating, \u201cAll prejudices,\nwhether of race, sect, or sex, class pride, and caste distinctions are\nthe belittling inheritance and badge of snobs and prigs\u201d (VAJC,\n105). Cooper\u2019s disdain for such thinking is thoroughly\ncommunicated. She adds, \u201cThe philosophic mind sees that its\nown \u2018rights\u2019 are the rights of humanity\u201d (VAJC, 105).\nCooper is denouncing oppression against all persons, \u201cThe\nwhite woman does not need to sue the Indian, or the Negro, or any other\nrace or class who have been crushed under the iron heel of Anglo Saxon\npower and selfishness\u201d (VAJC, 108).\n\n\nFor Cooper, it is necessary to reject and speak out against all\nforms of oppression. She petitions:\n \n\nIt is not the intelligent woman versus the ignorant\nwoman; nor the white woman versus the black, the brown, and the\nred\u2014it is not even the cause of woman versus\nman\u2026[W]oman\u2019s strongest vindication for speaking is that the\nworld needs to hear her voice\u2026when race, color, sex, condition,\nare realized to be accidents, not the substance of life\u2026then\nwoman\u2019s lesson is taught and woman\u2019s lesson is won\u2014not the white\nwoman not the black woman nor the red woman, but the cause of every\nman or woman who has writhed silently under a mighty wrong. (VAJC,\n108)\n\n\n\nShe pleads the cause of every man and woman who is wronged,\nrejecting oppression against the ignorant, various races, and\nwomen.\n\u201cThe Status of Woman in America\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Status of Woman in America\u201d (1892), Cooper\ndemonstrates continued awareness of issues facing Black women in\nAmerica and she advocates their political involvement and\nempowerment. Cooper discusses the U.S. economy and the condition\nof women during the woman\u2019s era of the late nineteenth century,\n(VAJC,\n 11).[7] \nShe brings\nto the forefront the dilemma of the Black woman, the fact that\n\u201cShe is confronted by both a woman question and a race problem\nand is as yet an unknown or an unacknowledged factor in both\u201d (VAJC,\n112).\n \n\nCooper emphasizes the dedication of educated and uneducated Black\nwomen to the survival of the race. Both have demonstrated their\ncommitment to the race in concrete ways, for example, by leaving their\nhusbands for committing \u201crace disloyalty\u201d in their voting\nchoices during Reconstruction (VAJC, 133 and 115). She states,\n\u201cIt is notorious that ignorant black women in the South have\nactually left their husband\u2019s homes\u2026for what was understood by\nthe wife to be race disloyalty, or \u2018voting away\u2019 as she\nexpresses it, the privileges of herself and her little ones\u201d\n(VAJC, 115). Cooper makes many references here to Black men, the role\nthey played in politics, and how they were \u201cabsorbed in the\nimmediate needs of their own political interests\u201d (VAJC,\n113). She also mentions the perception that the \u201cDemocratic\nNegro is a traitor and a time server\u201d (VAJC, 115). She adds,\n\u201c\u2026there are not many men\u2026who would dare face a\nwife quivering in every fiber with the consciousness that her husband\nis a coward who could be paid to desert her deepest and dearest\ninterests\u201d (VAJC, 115).\n \n\nIn this essay, Cooper makes no attempt to gloss over the sexist\nchallenges faced by Black women. She states that Black women are\n\u201champered and shamed by a less liberal sentiment and a more\nconservative attitude on the part of those for whose opinion she cares\nmost [i.e. Black men]\u201d (VAJC, 113). She adds, \u201cAs far as\nmy experience goes the average man of our race is less frequently\nready to admit the actual need among the sturdier forces of the world\nfor women\u2019s help or influence\u201d (VAJC, 113). Cooper asserts that\nwomen have significant contributions to make to social, economic, and\nnational issues (\u201cGreat social and economic questions await her\ninfluence\u201d [VAJC, 113]).  They can shed light on the\nmanagement of school systems, public institutions, prison systems, and\nmental institutions (VAJC, 113). Cooper understood that the status of\nwomen and their role in the progress of the race was changing. She\nrecalls that fifty years before her time a woman\u2019s activity was\nlimited to \u201ca clearly cut \u2018sphere\u2019, including\nprimarily the kitchen and the nursery\u2026 [But] the woman of today\nfinds herself in the presence of responsibilities which ramify through\nthe profoundest and most varied interests of her country and\nrace\u201d (VAJC, 116).\n\n\nThis can be read in contrast to some of the gender roles that Cooper\noutlined in the \u201cWomanhood\u201d essay. In the\n\u201cStatus\u201d essay we see Cooper take up a stronger more\nencompassing notion of Black female agency that more readily embraces\nnew opportunities and possibilities for Black women outside of the\ndomestic sphere. She is speaking here of the vital roles that\nwomen must play outside of the home in order to see progress for the\nBlack race. What she has in mind here goes beyond the traditional\nstandards of white womanhood. \n\u201cHas America a Race Problem? If So, How Can it Best Be Solved?\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cHas America a Race Problem? If So, How Can it Best\nBe Solved?\u201d (1892) Cooper argues that progressive peace is\nachieved through fair conflict and difference, anticipating later work\nby Audre Lorde. According to Cooper, \u201cAll through\nGod\u2019s universe we see eternal harmony and symmetry as the\nunvarying result of the equilibrium of opposing forces\u201d (VAJC,\n121). Operating at the forefront of this analysis is racial conflict. What Cooper has in mind is not the obliteration\nof one race by another, but the progress that is achievable when we\nembrace difference and change. Cooper endorses multiculturalism\nand racial diversity for the purpose of progress and argues that\nisolation hinders the development of racial groups rather\nthan making them stronger. Here Cooper is responding to various\npositions about interactions, or even admixture, between races. \nLike Crummell before her and Du Bois after her, Cooper was convinced\nthat every race had a particular purpose and message to contribute\ntoward human progress. Du Bois has been credited with\nmaking this claim in \u201cConservation of Races\u201d from\nThe Souls of Black Folk, but this idea had been prevalent for\nyears before the 1897 \u201cConservation of Races\u201d speech.\n\n\nRobert Bernasconi has traced this idea back to the philosophy of\nJohann Gottfried von Herder who wrote Ideas on the Philosophy of\nthe History of Humankind (1784). Herder (against Immanuel Kant)\nactually \u201crejected the division of humanity into races and\ninsisted that a division into peoples is more appropriate\u201d\n(Bernasconi 2000, 23).  Herder argued that each group of peoples has a\nunique and important contribution to make to civilization. Going\nagainst prevailing 18th century ideas about civilization\nand race, Herder asserted that the Negro is a human and not an\nanimal. He adds, \u201cYou should not oppress him, nor murder him,\nnor steal from him: for he is a human being just as you\nare\u2026\u201d (Bernasconi 2000, 26).\n\n\nThis provides greater insight into not only Du Bois\u2019s claim that\n\u201cmanifestly some of the great races of today\u2014particularly\nthe Negro race\u2014have not as yet given to civilization the full\nspiritual message which they are capable of giving (Du Bois 1897,\nquoted from Du Bois 1903, 26), but also Cooper\u2019s claim (five years\nbefore Du Bois) that \u201cEach race has its badge, its exponent, its\nmessage, branded in its forehead by the great Master\u2019s hand\nwhich is its own peculiar keynote, and its contribution to the harmony\nof the nations\u201d (VAJC, 122). For Cooper, the delivery of each\nmessage requires contact and conflict, but\nnot brutal repression and racial domination. Cooper is\nclear that prejudice and race domination only leads to immobility and\ndeath. Implicit in her argument is a rejection of the complete\nassimilation (or even amalgamation) of one race into another. (This is also a theme that is taken up later by Du Bois.) \nCooper constantly reiterates the point that race differences are\nintended to encourage races to sharpen or improve one another through\nequilibrium, conflict, and harmony, not through domination and\nhierarchy, or even assimilation. We see the significance of God\neven in Cooper\u2019s philosophy of history as it relates to conflict\nand progress when she explains, \u201cthe God of battles is in the\nconflicts of history. The evolution of civilization is in His\ncare, eternal progress His delight\u201d (VAJC, 129).\n\u201cThe Negro As Presented in American Literature\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Negro As Presented in American Literature\u201d\n(1892) Cooper shows that standpoint theory does not have to devolve\ninto unending relativism when we take into account the possibility of\nan inauthentic standpoint. She expresses her outrage at\npseudo-intellectuals who disingenuously take up the \u201cNegro\nquestion\u201d to analyze race, bringing with them their prejudices,\nantipathies, and a rejection of any candid and careful study. She\nexplains that with \u201cflippant indifference\u201d many\n\u201caspire to enlighten the world with dissertations on the racial\ntraits of the Negro\u201d (VAJC, 140). This is the case, not only for\ndissertations on race, but also for art and literature that seeks to\nportray a distorted image of the Negro. Cooper asserts, \u201cit is an insult\nto humanity and a sin against God to publish any such sweeping\ngeneralizations of a race on such meager and superficial\ninformation. We meet at every turn\u2014this obtrusive and\noffensive vulgarity, this gratuitous sizing up of the Negro and\nconclusively writing down his equation, sometimes even among his ardent\nfriends and bravest defenders\u201d (VAJC, 147).\n\n\nCooper calls into question the standpoint from which such\ndissertations are written and argues that the Negro has the right to\nidentify the shortcomings of such analyses. The issues raised by\nCooper here concern not only the standpoint from which these materials\nare produced, but also the inauthenticity of the product itself.  This\ninauthenticity leads to a mass production of images that\n\u201cportray colored persons only as bootblacks and hotel waiters,\ngrinning from ear to ear and bowing and curtseying for the extra\ntips\u201d (VAJC, 149). As a result of this false yet dominating\nimage, many have not seen, \u201cand therefore cannot be convinced\nthat there exists a quiet, self-respecting, dignified class,\n\u2026of cultivated tastes and habits\u2026\u201d among Negroes,\n(VAJC, 149). Even more impressive than Cooper\u2019s ability to advance\nissues of standpoint theory and authenticity, is her insight about the\nproducers of these controlling negative images. Cooper asserts that\nrather than producing an accurate picture of the Black man, these\nportraits only reveal the consciousness (or subconsciousness) of the\nwhite man producing the images.  According to Cooper, the authentic\nimage of the Negro has not yet been produced. She assets, \u201can\nauthentic portrait, at once aesthetic and true to life, presenting the\nBlack man as a free American citizen, not just the humble slave of\nUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u2014but the man, divinely\nstruggling and aspiring yet tragically warped and distorted by the\nadverse winds of circumstance, has not yet been painted\u2026that\ncanvass awaits the brush of the colored man himself\u201d (VAJC,\n158).\n\u201cWhat Are We Worth?\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cWhat Are We Worth?\u201d Cooper provides a theoretical\nrendering of race prejudice, grounding it in sentiment and/or\nideas. Cooper\u2019s starting point for these reflections is a\nquote from Henry Ward Beecher (brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe) in\nwhich he asks, if Africa and Africans where to sink into the ocean\n\u201chow much poorer would the world be?\u201d and then posits that\nin the end \u201cnot a poem, not an invention, not a piece of art\nwould be missed from the world\u201d\u2014suggesting that none of\nthe above have been contributed to the world by Africa or\nAfricans. From this starting point Cooper goes on to describe\nsentiment as \u201cephemeral\u201d, \u201cshifting\u201d, and\n\u201cunreliable\u201d, and furthermore that \u201ccolor\nprejudice or race prejudice is mere sentiment governed by the\nassociation of ideas\u201d (VAJC, 162). Cooper surmises that when she\nhears expressions of dislike of the Negro for being \u201cweak\u201d\nsuch sentiments are an example of narrow-mindedness that is not worth\nengaging. She states, \u201cNow this dislike it is useless to\ninveigh against and folly to rail at\u201d (VAJC, 162).\n\n\nPresenting race prejudice as sentiment governed by the association\nof ideas, Cooper explains that it is \u201cimpervious to reason\u201d\nand \u201ccannot be annihilated by rhetoric\u201d (VAJC, 163). \nThus, rather than approach the question of the worth of Africans from the standpoint of sentiment, Cooper raises the\nexistential and phenomenological question of the value of human\npersons, particularly persons of African descent in the American\ncontext. She then shifts her analysis of worth to market value,\nexamining the notion of worth as determined by the value of material,\nlabor, and in the case of persons, the vital importance of education\n(\u201cEducation, then, is the safest and richest investment possible\nto man\u201d [VAJC, 168]).\n\n\nCooper offers an array of statistics on Black schools (including\nearly childhood developments, colleges, and universities), teachers,\nministers, and other professionals (e.g. doctors and lawyers) to make\nthe case for the \u201cunassisted effort of the colored people for\nself-development\u201d (VAJC, 169). She also provides\nstatistics on the high mortality rates, the economic disempowerment of\nshare cropping systems, and the limited housing opportunities among\nBlack Americans. Cooper describes the white labor unions of the\nNorth as tyrannical insofar as their working conditions are far more\npreferable to those of Black men working for fifty cents per day in the\nfields and \u201cthe pinched and down-trodden colored women bending\nover wash-tubs and ironing boards\u2014with children to feed and\nhouse rent to pay, wood to buy, soap and starch to \nfurnish\u2014lugging home weekly great baskets of clothes for \nfamilies who pay them\nfor a month\u2019s laundrying barely enough to purchase a substantial\npair of shoes\u201d (VAJC, 173). Cooper critiques labor unions when she describes\n\u201cforeigners\u201d and \u201cimmigrant laborers, who cannot even\nspeak English\u201d threatening to \u201ccut off the nerve and\nparalyze the progress of an industry that gives work to an\nAmerican-born citizen\u201d (VAJC, 173\u2013174).\n\n\nReturning to the education question, Cooper is clear that she\nsupports both classical education and trade education based on what is\nmost appropriate for the individual student. On the one hand, she notes, \u201cI\nwant nothing I may say to be construed into an attack on classical\ntraining or on art development and culture. I believe in allowing\nevery longing of the human soul to attain its utmost reach\u201d\n(VAJC, 175). On the other hand, she is clear that, \u201cThe\npower of appreciation is the measure of an individual\u2019s\naptitudes; and if a boy hates Greek and Latin and spends all his time\nwhittling out steamboats, it is rather foolish to try to force him into\nthe classics\u201d (VAJC, 175).\n\n\nAs if rebutting the opening suggestion by Beecher that Africans have\nnot contributed poetry, inventions, or art\u2014Cooper highlights\nthe poetic contributions of Phillis Wheatley, the inventions of\nsuccessful Black farmers, the heroism of Black soldiers, and the\nartistic work of sculptor Mary Edmonia Lewis. Coming full circle\nback to her description of race prejudice as sentiment Cooper\nconcludes: \u201cShort sighted idiosyncrasies are but transient\nphenomena. It is futile to combat them, and unphilosophical to be\ndepressed by them\u2026Our only care need be the intrinsic worth of\nour contributions\u2026and if we contribute a positive value in those\nthings the world prizes, no amount of negrophobia can ultimately\nprevent its recognition\u201d (VAJC, 187).\n\u201cThe Gain from a Belief\u201d\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Gain from a Belief\u201d Cooper takes on English and\nFrench progressivism and positivism of the 19th century\n(Mill, Comte, and others) using these figures\u2019 organic metaphors\nand visions of cultural development to explore the debates about racial\nuplift, the so-called Negro problem, liberalism, cosmopolitanism, and\nuniversal brotherhood. She presents the reader with a\nphilosophical antagonist\u2014a solitary figure with a cold,\nintellectual eye, pallid check, and harrowed brow. He represents\n\n\u201cSpeculative unbelief, curiously and sneeringly watching the\n\nhumdrum, common-place, bread-and-butter toil of unspeculative\nbelief\u201d (VAJC, 188). This thinker\u2014with his\nspeculative unbelief, skepticism, positivism, and agnosticism, is\njuxtaposed with \u201cstruggling, working, believing humanity\u201d\nthat holds unscientific faith. Confronting the imagined\nphilosophical figure Cooper states, \u201cSir\u2026Your philosophy,\nI presume, lifts you above the toils and anxieties, the ambitions and\naspirations of the common herd. Pardon me, but do you not feel\ncalled to devote those superior powers of yours to the uplifting of\nyour less favored brotheren?\u201d (VAJC, 188).\n\n\nCooper goes on to describe various philosophical positions\nconcerning positivism, agnosticism, and skepticism looking at the works\nof Pascal, Ritcher, Hume, Comte, Huxley, Mill, Spencer, Lewes, and\nIngersoll. Against these philosophies, Cooper makes the case for\nthe import of heroism, devotion, and sacrifice inspired by feeling,\nfaith, and belief. She clarifies her position of faith noting,\n\u201cI do not mean by faith the holding of correct views and\nunimpeachable opinions on mooted questions; nor to I understand it to\nbe the ability to forge cast-iron formulas and dub them TRUTH\u2026To\nme, faith means treating the truth as true\u201d (VAJC,\n193). These points are directed toward the possibilities and\nvarious beliefs concerning racial uplift. \n\n\nCooper asserts, \u201cLife must be more than dilettante\nspeculation\u201d (VAJC, 194). Rather than talking as a\nspectator, you ought to lead, finance, and live what you believe. \nTaking up some of the racial debates of that time, Cooper argues that\none\u2019s actions should follow from one\u2019s beliefs. If\nyou believe that \u201c\u2026the Negro race in America has a\nveritable destiny in His [God\u2019s] eternal purposes\u201d\u2026\nthen time should not be wasted on \u201cdiscussing the \u2018Negro\nProblem\u2019 amid the clouds of your fine Havana, ensconced in your\nfriend\u2019s well-cushioned arm-chair and with your patent leather\nboot-tips elevated to the opposite mantle\u201d (VAJC, 194).\nIf you believe that \u201cGod hath made one blood of all\nnations of the earth; and that interests which specialize and contract\nbroad, liberal, cosmopolitan idea of universal brotherhood and equality\nare narrow and pernicious, then treat that truth as true\u201d (VAJC,\n194). Cooper asks philosophers and thinkers to be consistent in\napplying their positions and expressing their beliefs. She\nadvises, \u201cDon\u2019t inveigh against lines of longitude drawn by\nothers when at the same time you are applying your genius to devising\nlines of latitude which are neither race lines, nor character lines,\nnor intelligence lines\u2014but certain social-appearance circlets\nassorting your \u2018universal brotherhood\u2019 by shapes of noses\nand texture of hair\u201d (VAJC, 194). Cooper continues,\n\u201cIf you object to imaginary lines\u2014don\u2019t\ndraw them! Leave only the real lines of nature and\ncharacter\u201d (VAJC, 195). She concludes by returning to the\nimport of the power of belief, \u201cIf thou believest, all things are\npossible; and as thou believest, so be it to thee\u201d\n(VAJC, 196).\n",
