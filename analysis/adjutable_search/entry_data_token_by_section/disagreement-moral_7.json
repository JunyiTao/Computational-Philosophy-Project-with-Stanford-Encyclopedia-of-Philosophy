    "main_text": "Epistemological Arguments from Moral Disagreement\n4. Epistemological Arguments from Moral Disagreement\n\n\nThe argument to the effect that moral disagreement generates\nproblems for moral realists by committing them to the inaccessibility\nof moral facts is ultimately of an epistemological nature. It is thus\ncongenial with the more general idea that disagreement sometimes raises\nskeptical worries by suggesting that our grounds for the contested\nbeliefs are inadequate and that they thus fail to be adequately\njustified or amount to knowledge. And although that idea applies to\nother areas as well, it is often taken to have a special relevance to\nethics, given the extent of the disagreement that occurs there.\n\n\nThe skeptical conclusions that moral disagreement has been taken to\nwarrant vary in strength, both modally and in terms of scope. The claim\nthat moral facts are inaccessible is modally strong in that it goes\nbeyond saying just that we actually lack moral knowledge or justified\nmoral beliefs. But moral disagreement has been invoked in defense of\nmodally weaker claims as well. Note that the fact that a form of\nskepticism is weak in the modal sense and just pertains to our actual\nsituation does not mean that it cannot be a part of an argument against\nmoral realism. At least, that is so as long as it is sufficiently broad\nin scope. For example, if it were shown that we are in fact unjustified\nin thinking of any moral claim that it is a truth, then that\nwould arguably diminish our justification for thinking that there are\nsuch truths in the first place (see further Tersman 2019). However, if\na skeptical conclusion is weak not only in the modal sense but also in\nthe scope sense, so that it applies only to a limited subset of our\nmoral beliefs, then it is less likely to have a role to play in a\nforceful challenge against moral realism (or other positions that seek\nto leave room for moral\n knowledge).[4]\nStill, the contention that moral disagreement has\nsuch implications is interesting in its own right.\n\n\nThe focus below is on arguments which seek to cast doubt on the\nexistence of moral knowledge, even granted that there are moral truths.\nAn alternative approach is to first argue that the disagreement\ndirectly excludes the existence of moral truths and then to simply\nderive the thesis that there is no moral knowledge from that conclusion\n(given that knowledge presupposes truth). That alternative strategy\nwill be set aside in this section. Thus, since the arguments are\nsupposed to support skeptical conclusions independently of any\nrejection of moral truths, they need to establish that our moral\nbeliefs violate some other precondition of knowledge, such as, most\ncommonly, justification.\n\n\nAny argument to that effect raises general questions about what it\ntakes for a belief to constitute knowledge or to be justified.\nNevertheless, those who put forward skeptical arguments from moral\ndisagreement do not always invoke any such general view. The reason\nmight be that they believe that the skeptical conclusions follow on\njust about any of the most promising theories that have emerged in\nepistemology, which obviously would make the arguments less vulnerable\n(see e.g., Tolhurst 1987 for this suggestion). However, others do\nexplicitly state some general view of knowledge or justification on\nwhich they rely.\n",
