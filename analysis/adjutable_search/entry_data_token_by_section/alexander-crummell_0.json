    "main_text": "Biographical Sketch\n1. Biographical Sketch\n\n\nAlexander Crummell was born free in New York City on March 3, 1819.\nHis mother, Charity Hicks of Long Island, New York, was also born free,\nwhile his father, Boston Crummell of the Temne people of West Africa,\nthough originally sold into slavery, eventually became free in\nadulthood.\n\n\nCoinciding with his marriage in 1841 to Sarah Mabitt Elston,\nCrummell's career as a public thinker began in earnest. His prominence\nas a young intellectual earned him a spot as keynote speaker at the\nanti-slavery New York State Convention of Negroes when it met in Albany\nin 1840. Despite race-based resistance, he successfully trained for the\npriesthood, becoming an Episcopal priest later that same decade. He\nstudied moral philosophy at Cambridge University under William Whewell,\nwhose view of moral reasoning as an intuition of necessary moral truths\nclearly influenced Crummell's own thought. After taking his bachelor's\ndegree at Queen's College at Cambridge he resumed his avid\nparticipation in the anti-slavery movement. He subsequently went to\nLiberia taking a position as a professor of English and moral\nphilosophy at Liberia College. His time there was difficult, owing to\npersonal challenges and political opposition, leading him to return to\nthe States after the Civil War. His first book was published in New\nYork, entitled The Future of Africa (1862); in it he\nsolidified much of his early thinking on morality and language. Two\nsubsequent books, The Greatness of Christ (1882) and\nAfrica and America (1891), reflected his more mature thought\non agency and moral change.\n\n\nHis first marriage ended when Elston died in 1878, after which he\nmarried Jennie Simpson in 1880. Late in his life he held a lectureship\nat Howard University, though his most enduring contribution to black\nAmerican letters was his co-founding of the American Negro Academy in\nWashington, DC, in 1897. He helped assemble a number of leading black\nintellectuals\u2014including Du Bois and, much later, Locke\u2014to publish\nresearch on problems facing blacks. During its three decades of\nexistence twenty-two papers appeared. Its disbanding in the 1920s\ncoincided with the Negro Renaissance in Harlem, the rise of Marcus\nGarvey, and the turn to pragmatism and relativism in American\nthought.\n\n\nCrummell died in Red Bank, New Jersey, on September 10, 1898.\n",
