    "main_text": "Socrates\u2019s strangeness\n1. Socrates\u2019s strangeness\n\nStandards of beauty are different in different eras, and in\nSocrates\u2019s time beauty could easily be measured by the standard\nof the gods, stately, proportionate sculptures of whom had been\nadorning the Athenian acropolis since about the time Socrates reached\nthe age of thirty. Good looks and proper bearing were important to a\nman\u2019s political prospects, for beauty and goodness were linked\nin the popular imagination. The extant sources agree that Socrates was\nprofoundly ugly, resembling a satyr more than a man\u2014and\nresembling not at all the statues that turned up later in ancient\ntimes and now grace Internet sites and the covers of books. He had\nwide-set, bulging eyes that darted sideways and enabled him, like a\ncrab, to see not only what was straight ahead, but what was beside him\nas well; a flat, upturned nose with flaring nostrils; and large fleshy\nlips like an ass. Socrates let his hair grow long, Spartan-style (even\nwhile Athens and Sparta were at war), and went about barefoot and\nunwashed, carrying a stick and looking arrogant. He didn\u2019t\nchange his clothes but efficiently wore in the daytime what he covered\nhimself with at night. Something was peculiar about his gait as well,\nsometimes described as a swagger so intimidating that enemy soldiers\nkept their distance. He was impervious to the effects of alcohol and\ncold weather, but this made him an object of suspicion to his fellow\nsoldiers on campaign. We can safely assume an average height (since no\none mentions it at all), and a strong build, given the active life he\nappears to have led. Against the iconic tradition of a pot-belly,\nSocrates and his companions are described as going hungry\n(Aristophanes, Birds 1280\u201383). On his appearance, see\nPlato\u2019s Theaetetus 143e, and Symposium\n215a\u2013c, 216c\u2013d, 221d\u2013e; Xenophon\u2019s\nSymposium 4.19, 5.5\u20137; and Aristophanes\u2019s\nClouds 362. Brancusi\u2019s oak sculpture, standing 51.25\ninches including its base, captures Socrates\u2019s appearance and\nstrangeness in the sense that it looks different from every angle,\nincluding a second \u201ceye\u201d that cannot be seen if the first\nis in view. (See the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s\n page on Brancusi\u2019s Socrates\n which offers additional views.) Also true to Socrates\u2019s\nreputation for ugliness, but less available, are the drawings of the\ncontemporary Swiss artist, Hans Erni.\n\nIn the late fifth century B.C.E., it was more or less taken for\ngranted that any self-respecting Athenian male would prefer fame,\nwealth, honors, and political power to a life of labor. Although many\ncitizens lived by their labor in a wide variety of occupations, they\nwere expected to spend much of their leisure time, if they had any,\nbusying themselves with the affairs of the city. Men regularly\nparticipated in the governing Assembly and in the city\u2019s many\ncourts; and those who could afford it prepared themselves for success\nat public life by studying with rhetoricians and sophists from abroad\nwho could themselves become wealthy and famous by teaching the young\nmen of Athens to use words to their advantage. Other forms of higher\neducation were also known in Athens: mathematics, astronomy, geometry,\nmusic, ancient history, and linguistics. One of the things that seemed\nstrange about Socrates is that he neither labored to earn a living,\nnor participated voluntarily in affairs of state. Rather, he embraced\npoverty and, although youths of the city kept company with him and\nimitated him, Socrates adamantly insisted he was not a\nteacher (Plato, Apology 33a\u2013b) and refused all his\nlife to take money for what he did. The strangeness of this behavior\nis mitigated by the image then current of teachers and students:\nteachers were viewed as pitchers pouring their contents into the empty\ncups that were the students. Because Socrates was no transmitter of\ninformation that others were passively to receive, he resists the\ncomparison to teachers. Rather, he helped others recognize on their\nown what is real, true, and good (Plato, Meno,\nTheaetetus)\u2014a new, and thus suspect, approach to\neducation. He was known for confusing, stinging, and stunning his\nconversation partners into the unpleasant experience of realizing\ntheir own ignorance, a state sometimes superseded by genuine\nintellectual curiosity.\n\nIt did not help matters that Socrates seemed to have a higher opinion\nof women than most of his companions had, speaking of \u201cmen and\nwomen,\u201d \u201cpriests and priestesses,\u201d likening his work\nto midwifery, and naming foreign women as his teachers: Socrates\nclaimed to have learned rhetoric from Aspasia of Miletus, the de\nfacto spouse of Pericles (Plato, Menexenus); and to have\nlearned erotics from the priestess Diotima of Mantinea (Plato,\nSymposium). Socrates was unconventional in a related respect.\nAthenian citizen males of the upper social classes did not marry until\nthey were at least thirty, and Athenian females were poorly educated\nand kept sequestered until puberty, when they were given in marriage\nby their fathers. Thus the socialization and education of males often\ninvolved a relationship for which the English word\n\u2018pederasty\u2019 (though often used) is misleading, in which a\nyouth approaching manhood, fifteen to seventeen, became the beloved of\na male lover a few years older, under whose tutelage and through whose\ninfluence and gifts, the younger man would be guided and improved. It\nwas assumed among Athenians that mature men would find youths sexually\nattractive, and such relationships were conventionally viewed as\nbeneficial to both parties by family and friends alike. A degree of\nhypocrisy (or denial), however, was implied by the arrangement:\n\u201cofficially\u201d it did not involve sexual relations between\nthe lovers and, if it did, then the beloved was not supposed to derive\npleasure from the act\u2014but ancient evidence (comedies, vase\npaintings, et al.) shows that both restrictions were often violated\n(Dover 1989, 204). What was odd about Socrates is that, although he\nwas no exception to the rule of finding youths attractive (Plato,\nCharmides 155d, Protagoras 309a\u2013b; Xenophon,\nSymposium 4.27\u201328), he refused the physical advances of\neven his favorite, Alcibiades (Plato, Symposium\n219b\u2013d), and kept his eye on the improvement of their, and all\nthe Athenians\u2019, souls (Plato, Apology 30a\u2013b), a\nmission he said he had been assigned by the oracle of Apollo at\nDelphi, if he was interpreting his friend Chaerephon\u2019s report\ncorrectly (Plato, Apology 20e\u201323b), a preposterous\nclaim in the eyes of his fellow citizens. Socrates also acknowledged a\nrather strange personal phenomenon, a daimonion or internal\nvoice that prohibited his doing certain things, some trivial and some\nimportant, often unrelated to matters of right and wrong (thus not to\nbe confused with the popular notions of a superego or a conscience).\nThe implication that he was guided by something he regarded as divine\nor semi-divine was all the more reason for other Athenians to be\nsuspicious of Socrates.\n\nSocrates was usually to be found in the marketplace and other public\nareas, conversing with a variety of different people\u2014young and\nold, male and female, slave and free, rich and poor, citizen and\nvisitor\u2014that is, with virtually anyone he could persuade to join\nwith him in his question-and-answer mode of probing serious matters.\nSocrates\u2019s lifework consisted in the examination of\npeople\u2019s lives, his own and others\u2019, because \u201cthe\nunexamined life is not worth living for a human being,\u201d as he\nsays at his trial (Plato, Apology 38a). Socrates pursued this\ntask single-mindedly, questioning people about what matters most,\ne.g., courage, love, reverence, moderation, and the state of their\nsouls generally. He did this regardless of whether his respondents\nwanted to be questioned or resisted him. Athenian youths imitated\nSocrates\u2019s questioning style, much to the annoyance of some of\ntheir elders. He had a reputation for irony, though what that means\nexactly is controversial; at a minimum, Socrates\u2019s irony\nconsisted in his saying that he knew nothing of importance and wanted\nto listen to others, yet keeping the upper hand in every discussion.\nOne further aspect of Socrates\u2019s much-touted strangeness should\nbe mentioned: his dogged failure to align himself politically with\noligarchs or democrats; rather, he had friends and enemies among both,\nand he supported and opposed actions of both (see \u00a73).\n",
