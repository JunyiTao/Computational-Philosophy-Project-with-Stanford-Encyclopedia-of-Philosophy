    "main_text": "Varieties of Representationalism || Reductive vs. Nonreductive\n2.4 Reductive vs. Nonreductive\n\nAs Crane (2003) and Chalmers (2004) have pointed out,\nrepresentationalism need not be reductive. One might agree with the\nstrong representationalist that sensory qualities are identical with\nintentional contents, but also contend that the latter intentional\ncontent properties cannot be characterized without reference to\nsensory qualities, so despite the identity there cannot be reduction\nwithout circularity. Maintaining in this vein that\n\u201cqualia\u201d require a special phenomenal manner of\nrepresentation and holding that that manner cannot be reduced to the\nfunctional, Chalmers defends a nonreductive representationalism.\nRepresentationalists who sympathize with the view (of, e.g., Searle\n(1990) and Siewert (1998)) that intentionality requires consciousness\nwould also be motivated to remain nonreductive. Levine (2003) argues\nthat Shoemaker\u2019s (1994) view is nonreductive, on the grounds\nthat it explicates the qualitative character of an experience in terms\nof representing a property that is in turn characterized in terms of\nexperiences having that qualitative character (Levine does not\nconsider the apparent circularity vicious). But many other\nrepresentationalists are motivated by materialism and by the desire to\nreduce sensory qualities to intentionality, holding that\nintentionality is the more materialistically tractable of the two.\n",
