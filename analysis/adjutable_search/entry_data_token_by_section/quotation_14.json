What Kinds of Entities do Quotations Refer to?\n\nRunning parallel to the debate about how quotations refer\n(how they manage to hook up with their semantic values) is a debate\nabout what quotations refer to. One view that is widespread\nis that quotations are ambiguous or indeterminate. That is, one and\nthe same quotation, e.g. \u201clobster\u201d can, on this view,\nrefer to different objects on different occasions of use, all\ndepending on the context of utterance. Garcia-Carpintero (1994, p.\n261) illustrates this kind of view and the kind of argument typically\ngiven for it. He says that \u201cgone\u201d can refer to any of the\nfollowing:\n\nThe expression (\u2018\u2009\u2018gone\u2019 is\ndissyllabic\u2019);\nDifferent types instantiated by the tokens\n(\u2018\u2009\u2018gone\u2019 is cursive\u2019);\nDifferent types somehow related to the token (say, the graphic\nversion of the uttered quoted material, or the spoken version of the\ninscribed quoted material, as in \u2018\u2009\u2018gone\u2019\nsounds nice\u2019);\nDifferent tokens somehow related to the quoted token (\u2018What\nwas the part of the title of the movie which, by falling down, caused\nthe killing?\u2014\u2018gone\u2019 was\u2019);\nThe quoted token itself (\u2018At least one of these words is\nheavier than \u2018gone\u2019 which you should imagine written in\nbig wooden letters\u2019);\n\n\nOthers think quotation can pick out contents or concepts. Goldstein\nsays:\n\nFor when Elvis says \u2018Baby, don\u2019t say\n\u2018don\u2019t\u2019,\u2019 he is not just requiring his baby to\nrefrain, when confronted with a certain request, from uttering tokens\nof the same phonetic shape as \u2018don\u2019t\u2019, but from\nuttering any tokens that mean the same. (Goldstein 1984, p.\n4)\n\n\nSaka (1998, p. 124) concurs and claims that \u201cpremise\u201d and\n\u201cpremiss\u201d in (38) pick out concepts:\n\n(38)\nThe concept \u2018premise\u2019 is the same as the concept\n\u2018premiss\u2019.\n\n\nTsohatzidis (1998) claims that since T1 is true, even though Descartes\ndidn\u2019t speak English, \u201cis a thinking substance\u201d in\nT1 can\u2019t refer to an English expression.\n\n(T1) In one of the greatest philosophy books ever written in Latin,\nDescartes said that man \u2018is a thinking substance\u2019.\n\nThese arguments all take the same form: first, they identify a\nsentence \\(S\\) that we are inclined to interpret as true and\nsuggest that the only way to understand how \\(S\\) can be true is\nto assume that quotations can refer to some kind of object \\(O\\).\nThis is then alleged to be evidence that quotations can be used to\nrefer to objects of kind \\(O\\).\n\nIf quotation has this kind of flexibility, the five theories discussed\nabove will all have to be evaluated with respect to whether they can\naccommodate it. The Proper Name Theory, Description theory, and\nDisquotational Theory, all seem to have particular difficulties in\nthis respect.\n\nNot all, however, are convinced that quotations are flexible in just\nthis way. Some have expressed skepticism both about the form of\nargument (see Cappelen and Lepore 1999a) and about the specific\nexamples. Cappelen and Lepore (1999a) also argue that the multiple\nambiguity view over-generates, i.e., it predicts that it is possible\nto express propositions with quotation sentences that it is not\npossible to express with such sentences.
