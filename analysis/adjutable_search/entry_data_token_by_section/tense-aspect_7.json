    "main_text": "Event Calculus\n7. Event Calculus\n\nIn the following section we will show that the imperfective paradox is\nan instance of the frame problem prominent in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI). To this end we will explain the event calculus, which is an\nextension of McCarthy\u2019s situation calculus (McCarthy 1977) developed\nby Kowalski and Sergot (1986). Then we will indicate how the event\ncalculus leads to a formalization of natural language tense and aspect\nby analysing the imperfective paradox. \n\nConsider narrative (33). \n33.\n\nYesterday morning Vincent loaded the gun. Then he smoked a\ncigarette. After smoking he pointed the gun at Fred and pulled the\ntrigger.\n    \n\nAssuming that shooting at somebody with a loaded gun will lead to the\ndeath of that person, we will interpret the discourse in a way that\nFred eventually gets killed. Arriving at this inference is, however,\nnot a trivial task. In (33) the frame problem is exemplified in the\nform of the Yale Shooting Scenario (Hanks and McDermott 1986). To\ndemonstrate this, we will start with a very simple calculus\u2014a\nvariant of the Simple Event Calculus by Shanahan (1997) which\nonly incorporates a very basic notion of instantaneous change. Later\nwe will add axioms in order to deal with continuous change and then\nreturn to the imperfective paradox. In short, we will argue that the\nparadox can be viewed as an instance of the frame problem. \n",
