    "main_text": "\n\nFictionalism about a region of discourse can provisionally be\ncharacterized as the view that claims made within that discourse are\nnot best seen as aiming at literal truth but are better regarded as a\nsort of \u2018fiction\u2019. As we will see, this first\ncharacterization of fictionalism is in several ways rough. But it is a\nuseful point of departure.\n\nThis entry is divided into five main sections. The first section\ncontains a brief history and overview of fictionalist views. The\nsecond section describes more carefully what different kinds of\nfictionalist theses there are. In the third and fourth sections,\nimportant arguments for and against fictionalism are summarized. The\nfifth section is devoted to a more general discussion of the\nphilosophical significance of fictionalism.\n",
