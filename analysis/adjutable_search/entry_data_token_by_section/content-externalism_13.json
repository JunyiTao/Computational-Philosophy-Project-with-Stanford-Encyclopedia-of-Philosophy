    "main_text": "The Scope of Extended Mind\n7. Extended Mind and the 4E Mind\n\nAnother way of delineating the scope of extended mind is by more\nprecisely identifying its location in an array of anti-Cartesian\npossibilities. Extended mind supplies one of the\n\u201cE\u201ds in what has become known as 4E cognition, or\nthe 4E mind more generally in deference to the idea that its\nscope may be broader than simply cognition (Newen, De Bruin, &\nGallagher 2018). The label \u201c4E\u201d is intended to capture the\nidea that at least some mental processes are embodied,\nembedded, enacted and/or extended, or some\ncombination thereof.\n\nThe clam that mental processes are embodied can mean at least\ntwo distinct things (Prinz 2009). On the one hand, it can signify that\nmental processes depend on possession and use of a body rather than\nmerely a brain (Haugeland 1993, Shapiro 2004). This idea can, itself,\nfragment into different views, depending on how we understand the idea\nof dependence. The claim can be understood as causal dependence:\n(some) mental processes causally depend (for their existence,\nidentity, etc.) on the body and its characteristics. On the other\nhand, it can be understood as a claim of constitution: (some)\nprocesses occurring inside the body, but outside the brain, can\npartially constitute mental processes. On the other hand, there is\nanother way of understanding the claim that mental processes are\nembodied, specifically, as the claim that (some) mental processes\ndepend on mental representations that relate to body (Prinz 2009).\nThese representations come in two forms: ones that affect the body,\nsuch as motor commands, and ones that represent or respond to the\nbody, such as a perception of a bodily movement. Thus, on this view, a\nmental process would count as embodied if it involves, for example, a\nrepresentation located in the motor cortex, even though the motor\ncortex is intracranial.\n\nSome proponents of extended mind regard their view as\nantithetical to the claim that mental processes are embodied. For\nexample, Clark (2008a) argues that there is, at the very least, a tension between the two views. His version of extended mind is grounded in a liberal version of\nfunctionalism, according to which mental states and processes are individuated by functional roles specified in a fairly abstract way, as general principles linking perception, mental states and processes, and action that does not specify, in any depth, the nature of the mechanisms responsible for this linkage. The claim of embodiment, on\nthe other hand, Clark sees as grounded either in a rejection of functionalism, or in a form of functionalism that is far more chauvinistic, in that it does, in its specification of functional roles, specify at least some of the details of their realizing mechanisms. Others see extended and embodied views of the mind as much more compatible or aligned than this, even as different facets of the same view (for example, Menary 2007, Rowlands 2010).\n\nA mental process is embedded if it functions, perhaps has\nbeen designed to function, in tandem with a surrounding, environmental\nscaffolding, such that without the presence of this scaffolding the\nprocess will fail to do what it is supposed to do, or be less likely\nto achieve what it is supposed to achieve, or do what it is supposed\nto so in a less than maximally efficient way, etc. The external\nscaffolding carries information pertinent to the cognitive task that\nthe process is designed to accomplish, and a cognizing organism can,\nby manipulating or exploiting the structure in an appropriate way,\navail itself of this information. Cognition, on this view, still\nresides in the head. But the net result is that at least some of the\ndifficulty of the cognitive task is offloaded onto the world. The\nrequired internal, intra-cranial, processing is not as sophisticated\nas it would have needed to be if there was no environmental\nscaffolding around. Think of the difference between doing long\ndivision in your head or doing it with a pen and paper (Rumelhart et\nal. 1986). The external notation is a form of scaffolding that reduces\nthe complexity of the required internal processing. Kirsh and Maglio\n(1994) label this kind of action\u2014that changes the nature of the\ncognitive task that must be performed internally\u2014epistemic\naction.\n\nThe claim that some mental processes are embedded is, prima facie, one\nthat belongs on a spectrum of anti-Cartesian ways of conceptualizing\nthe mind. A, perhaps, curious feature of the recent dialectic, however, is\nthat the idea of embedding is often used as a way of devaluing the\nclaims of extended mind. The idea, here, is that the arguments\npurported to establish that mental processes are extended really only\nshow that such processes are embedded (Adams & Aizawa 2008, Rupert\n2004). This objection is a version of the\ncoupling-constitution objection outlined in\n section 5.2.\n\nA mental process is enacted if it involves, or is constituted\nby, a dynamic, interactive coupling of processes occurring inside the\nskin or skull of an organism and processes external to said skin or\nskull. Enactivism appears in a variety of forms. However, it is\nplausible to suppose that process-oriented extended mind\ncoincides with at least some of them. In explaining the nature of\nconscious experience, for example, many forms of enactivism appeal to\nthe ability of the experiencing organism to act on the world around.\nAbilities, perhaps, need not be extended. But some versions of\nenactivism also appeal to the exercise of these abilities. A\ncommon enactivist way of explaining the sense of phenomenal\npresence\u2014the sense of being presented with a richly structured,\ndetailed world\u2014does not appeal to a representational structure\nthat replicates this detail. If representations area involved at all,\nthey give us merely the rough gist of the visual situation. The sense\nof richness and details results from the experiencing organism\navailing itself of the richness and detail in the world itself\n(O\u2019Regan & No\u00eb 2001, No\u00eb [ed.] 2002, No\u00eb\n2004). By acting on a rich and detailed world, therefore, the organism\ninjects richness and detail into its experience. The organism\u2019s\nexperience of the richness and detail of the world is realized not by\na representation but by a sequence of dynamic, coupled interactions\nwith the external scene itself.\n\nEnactivism comes in a variety of forms (Chemero 2009; Hutto & Myin\n2012, 2017; No\u00eb 2004). But an emphasis on dynamic, tightly\ncoupled interactions between organism runs through all versions of\nenactivism and finds clear echoes in at least the process-oriented\nversion of extended mind. Thus, while there are, perhaps,\ndifferences of emphasis, it is likely that some versions of enactivism\ncoincide with some versions of extended mind.\n",
