Their views are laid out within the context of moral\nresponsibility (see Hourani 1971 & 1985 and Vasalou 2008). For\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians, while perhaps reason cannot discover all\nof those actions for which one is religiously responsible in order to\nbe a devout Muslim (such as praying five times daily or avoiding\npork), one could come to know the more general ethical human\nresponsibilities (such as avoiding lying and honoring one\u2019s\nbenefactor). This is because according to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the\nproperties that make an action good or bad, and for which one is\nmorally responsible, are objective qualities relative to the action,\nto the consequence(s) of the action or to the agent of the action.\nThese moral properties are objective precisely because we\nobserve\u2014whether through self-reflection or inference from the\noutward behavior of others\u2014the benefit or the harm that an\naction causes. Thus, in a consequentialist vein, these\nMu\u02bftazilites relate the morally good with what is genuinely\nbeneficial and the morally bad with what is harmful. Religion then\nconfirms what reason knows about the moral status of an action and its\nconsequence(s).\n\nSince for these thinkers the ethical status of an action does not\ndepend on a divine command, the question arises whether God is bound\nto behave ethically. \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r argued that ethical\ndemands are binding and applicable not only to human agents but also\nto God and his action as well (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r\nal-Ta\u02bfd\u012bl: 52\u201370). Thus, he argues that if\none denies that God is bound to do and to command the morally good,\nthe commands and prohibitions given in scripture would be not only\narbitrary but possibly even mutable and unreliable. For example, if\none allowed that God could lie, then God or the prophets could be\nlying about what is required for salvation or what leads to damnation,\nin which case all the religious teaching would be under suspicion, a\nposition which that \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r simply found\nunacceptable.\n",
