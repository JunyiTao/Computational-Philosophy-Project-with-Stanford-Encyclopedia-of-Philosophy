    "main_text": "\n\n\nZeno of Elea, 5th c. B.C.E. thinker, is known exclusively for \npropounding a number of ingenious paradoxes. The most famous of these\npurport to show that motion is impossible by bringing to light \napparent or latent contradictions in ordinary assumptions regarding \nits occurrence. Zeno also argued against the commonsense assumption \nthat there are many things by showing in various ways how it, too, \nleads to contradiction. We may never know just what led Zeno to \ndevelop his famous paradoxes. While it is typically said that he \naimed to defend the paradoxical monism of his Eleatic mentor, \nParmenides, the Platonic evidence on which this view has resided \nultimately fails to support it. Since Zeno\u2019s arguments in fact tend \nto problematize the application of quantitative conceptions to \nphysical bodies and to spatial expanses as ordinarily conceived, the \nparadoxes may have originated in reflection upon Pythagorean efforts \nto apply mathematical notions to the natural world. Zeno\u2019s paradoxes \nhave had a lasting impact through the attempts, from Aristotle down \nto the present day, to respond to the problems they raise. Since the \nsubject of this article is Zeno himself, it undertakes to provide an \nhistorically accurate overview of his own thought, rather than an \naccount of how philosophers, mathematicians, and physicists have \nresponded to his provocative arguments.\n",
