    "main_text": "Highlights of Historical Western Thought || The Enlightenment and Modern Developments\n2.3 The Enlightenment and Modern Developments\n\nDonne\u2019s casuistical treatise was an early example of the\nliberalized Enlightenment attitudes of the 1700s. The Thomistic\nnatural-law stance on suicide came under increasing attack as suicide\nwas examined through the lens of science and psychology. Where\nChristian theology has understood suicide as \u201can affair between\nthe devil and the individual sinner\u201d (Minois 1999, 300),\nEnlightenment philosophers tended to conceive of suicide in secular\nterms, as resulting from facts about individuals, their natural\npsychologies, and their particular social settings. David Hume gave\nvoice to this new approach with a direct assault on the Thomistic\nposition in his essay \u201cOf suicide\u201d (1783). Hume saw\ntraditional attitudes toward suicide as muddled and superstitious,\nrooted in confused understandings of God\u2019s relation to the\ncreated human world. (Lecaldano 2016) According to the Thomistic\nargument, suicide violates the order God established for the world and\nusurps God\u2019s prerogative in determining when we shall die.\nHume\u2019s argument against this thesis is intricate but rests on\nthe following considerations:\n\nIf by the \u2018divine order\u2019 is meant the causal laws\ncreated by God, then it would always be wrong to contravene these laws\nfor the sake of our own happiness. But clearly it is not wrong, since\nGod frequently permits us to contravene these laws, for he does not\nexpect us not to respond to disease or other calamities. Therefore,\nthere is not apparent justification, as Hume put it, for God\u2019s\npermitting us to disturb nature in some circumstances but not in\nothers. Just as God permits us to divert rivers for irrigation, so too\nought he permit us to divert blood from our veins.\nIf by \u2018divine order\u2019 is meant the natural laws God has\nwilled for us, which are (a) discerned by reason, (b) such that\nadherence to them will produce our happiness, then why should not\nsuicide conform to such laws when it appears rational to us that the\nbalance of our happiness is best served by dying?\nFinally if by \u2018divine order\u2019 is meant simply that\nwhich occurs according to God\u2019s consent, then God appears to\nconsent to all our actions (since an omnipotent God can\npresumably intervene in our acts at any point) and no distinction\nexists between those of our actions to which God consents and those to\nwhich He does not. If God has placed us upon the Earth like a\n\u201csentinel,\u201d then our choosing to leave this post and take\nour lives occurs as much with his cooperation as with any other act we\nperform.\n\n\nFurthermore, suicide does not necessarily violate any duties toward\nother people, according to Hume. Reciprocity may require that we\nbenefit society in exchange for the benefits it provides, but surely\nsuch reciprocity reaches its limit when by living we provide only a\n\u201cfrivolous advantage\u201d to society at the expense of\nsignificant harm or suffering for ourselves. In more extreme\nsituations, we are actually burdens to others, in which case our\ndeaths are not only \u201cinnocent, but laudable.\u201d\n\nFinally, Hume rejects the thesis that suicide violates our duties to\nself. Sickness, old age, and other misfortunes can make life\nsufficiently miserable that continued existence is worse than death.\nAs to worries that people are likely to attempt to take their lives\ncapriciously, Hume replies that our natural fear of death ensures that\nonly after careful deliberation and assessment of our future prospects\nwill we have the courage and clarity of mind to kill ourselves. In the\nend, Hume concludes that suicide \u201cmay be free of imputation of\nguilt and blame.\u201d His position is largely utilitarian, allied\nwith a strong presumption of personal liberty.\n\nBut Enlightenment philosophy was not univocal in its comparatively\npermissive attitudes toward suicide. The most noteworthy opponent of\nsuicide in this period was Immanuel Kant. Kant\u2019s arguments,\nthough they reflect earlier natural law arguments, draw upon his view\nof moral worth as emanating from the autonomous rational wills of\nindividuals (Cholbi 2000, 2010). For Kant, our rational wills are the\nsource of our moral duty, and it is therefore a kind of practical\ncontradiction to suppose that the same will can permissibly destroy\nthe very body that carries out its volitions and choices. Given the\ndistinctive worth of an autonomous rational will, suicide is an attack\non the very source of moral authority.\n\nTo annihilate the subject of morality in one\u2019s person is to root\nout the existence of morality itself from the world as far as one can,\neven though morality is an end in itself. Consequently, disposing of\noneself as a mere means to some discretionary end is debasing humanity\nin one\u2019s person\u2026 (Kant 423)\n\n\n(For a contemporary expression of this Kantian view of suicide, see\nVelleman 1999.)\n\nSuicide continued to be an important topic in post-Kantian German\nphilosophy (see Stellino 2020). Like Hume, Arthur Schopenhauer\nrejected virtually all moral arguments for the moral objectionability\nof suicide. Surprisingly though, Schopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic\nphilosophical outlook nevertheless led him to condemn suicide. The\ndesire to end our lives, according to Schopenhauer, arises from our\nwill\u2019s unceasing but ultimately futile pursuit of our desires.\nHence, rather than denying this striving or extricating us from the\nfundamental predicament of human existence, suicide ends up affirming\nthis striving and so represents a misguided grasp at freedom.\n(1819:425\u201327) Friedrich Nietzsche, in contrast, shared\nSchopenhauer\u2019s rejection of pious moralizing about suicide and\nhis belief in the striving of the will, but concluded that suicide is\nat least sometimes rational. For Nietzsche, suicide can be a\npraiseworthy assertion of one\u2019s will, a way to lend one\u2019s\nindividual life meaning in an otherwise meaningless world. (1883)\n\nThe nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also brought several\ndevelopments that, while not explicitly philosophical, have shaped\nphilosophical thought about suicide. The first was the emergence, in\nnovels by Rousseau, Goethe, and Flaubert, of a Romantic idealized\n\u2018script\u2019 for suicide, according to which suicide was the\ninevitable response of a misunderstood and anguished soul jilted by\nlove or shunned by society (Lieberman 2003). The second was the\nemergence of psychiatry as an autonomous discipline, populated by\nexperts asserting their ability to diagnose and treat melancholy,\nhysteria and other ailments sometimes thought responsible for suicide.\nLastly, largely thanks to the work of sociologists such as Durkheim\nand Laplace, suicide was increasingly viewed as a social ill\nreflecting widespread alienation, anomie, and other attitudinal\nbyproducts of modernity. In many European nations, the rise in suicide\nrates was thought to signal a cultural decline. These latter two\ndevelopments made suicide prevention a bureaucratic and medical\npreoccupation, leading to a wave of institutionalization for suicidal\npersons. All three conspired to suggest that suicide is caused by\nimpersonal social or psychological forces rather than by the agency of\nindividuals.\n",
