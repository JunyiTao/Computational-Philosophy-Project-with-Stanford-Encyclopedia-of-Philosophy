    "main_text": "Origins || Chicano Thought\n2.1 Chicano Thought\n\nOne way to reconstruct the origins of Latinx philosophy goes through\nthe history of the Chicano\n movement.[4]\n The Chicano movement was never any one thing, but in broad\nbrushstrokes, it tended to be distinguished by a kind of cultural\nnationalism that identified a people\u2014a Chicano\nraza\u2014with a homeland\u2014Aztl\u00e1n\u2014while\nalso emphasizing an imperative of liberation for those people and,\nsometimes, for that land (I. Garcia 2015). If we think of early\nChicano thought as a species of Latinx philosophy, then early Chicano\nthought is a natural candidate for one origin of Latinx\nphilosophy.\n\nImportant articulations of the movement\u2019s\naspirations\u2014including El plan espiritual de\nAztl\u00e1n\u2014employed concepts borrowed from twentieth\ncentury Mexican philosophy. Prominently among these was Jos\u00e9\nVasconcelos\u2019 La raza c\u00f3smica. In the prologue to\nLa raza c\u00f3smica, Vasconcelos claimed that Latin\nAmerica had the opportunity to be the future birthplace of a new and\nfinal race that would integrate the best cultural features from the\nrest of the world. The work\u2019s emphasis on seeing humankind as\ndivided by race, its articulation of a glorious indigenous past in the\nAmericas, its assertion that the age of the White race was coming to\nan end, and its prophetic tone of racial uplift rooted in the peoples\nof Latin America provided a ready framework for articulating some of\nthe Chicano movement\u2019s early aspirations (cf. Romano 1969).\n\nThere is some evidence that syllabi of the period included work by the\nMexican philosopher Samuel Ramos, and by Patrick Romanell, an\nimportant English-language discussant of Mexican philosophy\n(Soldatenko\n 1996).[5]\n Moreover, Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset\u2019s\nperspectivism\u2014roughly, the idea that knowledge is perspectival,\nand frequently structured by features of culture, time, and\nplace\u2014may have filtered into the self-understanding of parts of\nthe movement, in part because of his putative influence on Mexican\nfigures, the availability of translations of his work, and some\ndiscussion of him in the work of Octavio Paz. Nevertheless, systematic\nattempts to pursue anything like a Chicanx philosophy in a form that\nmight be recognized as academic philosophy was rare. In general, the\nChicano movement was not marked by frequent or sustained attempts to\nelaborate an explicit theoretical foundation in philosophical terms\n(I. Garcia 2015).\n\nNevertheless, there were some attempts at doing philosophy in a\ndistinctively Chicano vein. Perhaps the most notable example was Elihu\nCarranza\u2019s Chicanismo: Philosophical Fragments (1978).\nIt is an unusual text. It owes its structure and sensibility in part\nto Kierkegaard\u2019s Philosophical Fragments, and each of\nthe main chapters has a pseudonymous author. At the same time, its\nconcern and motivations openly draw from Mexican philosopher Samuel\nRamos\u2019 critical investigation into a supposedly shared\n\u201cMexican\u201d psychological profile. In Carranza\u2019s case,\nChicanxs (and Chicano Studies) are the\n subject.[6]\n\nDespite some threads of influence from Mexican philosophy (for an\noverview, see Soldatenko 1996), philosophical work on Chicanxs (and\nLatinxs more generally) seems to have been limited to work by those\noutside the discipline of philosophy, at least until the later\nrenaissance of Latina feminist philosophy. Moreover, the nature of\nearly Chicanx thought presents an ambiguous case for the origins of a\nLatinx philosophy.\n\nFirst, especially in the early period of the Chicano Movement there\nwas comparatively little systematic concern for articulating a\ntheoretical framework that encompassed Latinos more generally. Second,\na good deal of the symbolic framework of the movement did not readily\ngeneralize to other groups of Latinxs. For example, the mestizo racial\nnarrative has proven to be problematic in a variety of ways and it\ndoes not readily extend to all Latinx groups (cf. Velazco y Trianosky\n2009; Gallegos forthcoming). Moreover, documents like the Treaty of\nGuadalupe, and the appeal to an indigenous\u2014especially\nAztec\u2014past, cannot be used in the same way to anchor a shared\nidentity with other Latinx groups (or even those groups of\nMexican-descended people who cannot trace their ancestry to the\nAztecs). Third, it would be something of a cold irony for one strand\nof the cultural-nationalist (and sometimes separatist wing) of the\nChicano movement to be thought of as having constituted the origins of\na broader, pan-Latinx intellectual project. Those strands of the\nChicano movement were often animated by a resistance to anything that\nfailed to recognize the cultural specificity of Chicanxs. On such\nviews, acceptance of a Latinx identity necessarily entails a risk of\ncultural dissociation from the specifically Mexican roots of Chicanx\nidentity, and brings with it an impermissible homogenization via a\npan-Latinx\n category.[7]\n For that reason, it would sound strange to some activists and\ntheorists to frame Chicanx thought as an early exemplar of Latinx\nphilosophy.\n\nStill, if one did think it plausible that Chicanx thought was an\norigin for Latinx philosophy, it might seem natural to find the origin\nof Latinx philosophy still further back in Latin American philosophy.\nIndeed, there is a case to be made for that more distal origin.\n",
