But there\nare also valid sentences peculiar to Kaplan\u2019s logic of\nindexicals. For instance, the formal analogs of \u2018I exist\u2019\nand \u2018I am here now\u2019 are true in every context in every\nstructure, and so are valid. This result is due to Kaplan\u2019s\nstipulations that the agent of a context \\(c\\) exists at the time\nand world of \\(c\\), and that the agent of \\(c\\) is located at\nthe position of \\(c\\) at the time and world of \\(c\\). In\naddition, every (formal) sentence of the form \u201c\\(S\\) if and\nonly if actually \\(S\\)\u201d is valid. This is so because\n\\(S\\) is true at a context (in a structure) if and only if\n\u201cActually \\(S\\)\u201d is.\n\n\nA striking feature of Kaplan\u2019s logic is that some valid\nsentences are contingently true, at some contexts in some LD\nstructures. One example is \u2018I exist\u2019. We saw above that it\nis valid. Now consider an LD structure \\(M\\) in which Mary exists\nat some of the worlds in \\(M\\) but fails to exist at others. (More\nexactly, Mary is in the extension of \u2018Exist\u2019 at some pairs\n\\(\\langle t, w \\rangle\\) but is not in the extension of\n\u2018Exist\u2019 at some other pairs \n\\(\\langle t, w' \\rangle\\).) Next, consider a context \\(c\\) in which\nMary is the agent. The formal analog of the sentence \u2018I\nexist\u2019 is true with respect to \\(c\\) and the time and world\nof \\(c\\) in \\(M\\), and so is true at \\(c\\) in\n\\(M\\). But that sentence is false with respect to \\(c\\),\n\\(t\\), and other worlds in \\(M\\). Therefore,\n\u2018Necessarily, I exist\u2019 (or its formal analog) is false at\n\\(c\\) in \\(M\\). Thus, \u2018I exist\u2019 is only\ncontingently true at some contexts in some LD structures. Parallel\npoints holds for \u2018I am here now\u2019: it is valid, but only\ncontingently true at some contexts in some structures. Similarly, every\nsentence of the form \u201c\\(S\\) if and only if actually\n\\(S\\)\u201d is valid, but some sentences of this form are only\ncontingently true at some contexts in some structures.\n\n\nKaplan holds that since \u2018I exist\u2019 is valid, one could\nknow a priori the proposition that it expresses, in a context.\nFor example, if Mary considers and understands the sentence \u2018I\nexist\u2019, then she can know a priori the proposition that\nit expresses in her context. Thus Kaplan concludes that she can know\na priori the proposition that she exists. But this proposition\nis contingent, so Mary can have a priori knowledge of a\ncontingent proposition. Thus Kaplan claims that his logic of indexicals\nprovides examples of Kripke\u2019s (1980) contingent a priori\ntruths. (For discussion, see Salmon 1991, Forbes 1989)\n\n\nUsing a standard definition of validity for arguments,\nKaplan\u2019s formal analogs of arguments (13)\u2013(15) are valid.\n\n(13)\n\nI think. Therefore, I exist.\n\n(14)\n\nEvery human is mortal. I am human. Therefore, I am mortal.\n\n(15)\n\nThis is a hand. If this is a hand, then I am not a brain in a\nvat. Therefore, I am not a brain in a vat.\n\n\n\n\nThus, Kaplan\u2019s logic of indexicals may aid in understanding\nthe logic of some philosophically interesting arguments.\n",
