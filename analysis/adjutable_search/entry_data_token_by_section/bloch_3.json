    "main_text": "Bloch\u2019s Ontology of the Unfinished || Preliminary outlook\n2.3 Preliminary outlook\n\nBloch\u2019s writing style is unorthodox: he prefers to begin with\nlaconic phrases, resembling/striving to become aphorisms, and indulges\nin metaphors while often avoiding precise definitions. The ultimate\naim of this philosophy cast in \u201copen-ended essays\u201d (Holz\n1975) is to decipher the not-yet-uncovered utopian elements of the\nworld by showing\u2014somewhat performatively (Siebers 2013) and\nprivileging style over (not fully available) content (Edwards\n2013)\u2014how various concepts work as applied to particular\ncultural domains, rather than by building a logically coherent\ntheoretical\n system.[4]\n Indeed, such a system\u2019s closedness would contradict\nBloch\u2019s main ontological stance that implies spelling out the\ntensions, rather than resolving them (Adorno 1980).\n\nUtopian anticipation plays an ambiguous role in Bloch\u2019s\nphilosophy. On the one hand, it attaches special meanings to different\nelements of material and social reality, to various fragments of\nnature and history and thus serves, teleologically, as a unifying\nnormative force (1951 [GA 8: 487]), sometimes creating the impression\nthat Bloch overemphasizes the unity of futurity for its own sake\n(Eagleton 2015). On the other hand, it suspends any given form or\nentity as experimental and preliminary, emphasizes the risk of\nfetishizing the utopian goal, the teleology of the pre-given plan, and\ninsists on the impossibility to fully construe the new from the old,\non radical incompleteness of any achieved state or any present process\n(Lyotard 1976). The problem of the absolute is re-stated by Bloch as\nthe non-availability of the future and even of the tools to fully\ngrasp it. Crucially, this incompleteness also entails a permanent risk\nof failure, which again, dialectically, is just an opposite side of a\nfundamental instability and mutability of our world (Bloch\ncharacteristically calls things Auszugsgestalten ihrer\nselbst, \u201cforms of departure from themselves\u201d [Bloch\n1954\u201359 [1986a: 1345]]). In this sense, the question: where does\nutopia go? Or What is the eschatological aim of the utopian\nprocess?\u2014is both necessary and unanswerable. It should\nbe asked for defining the normative orientation of hope and for\nestablishing a proper critical function of \u201cconcrete\nutopia\u201d. But its answer is never perfect, either. In the state\nof absolute fulfillment, there is no place for utopian philosophy.\nThis philosophy is subject to its own critical scrutiny, its aims are\nonly formulated in the process, and its business itself is never\ncomplete. That is why the original title of\nThe Principle of Hope was Dreams of a Better\nLife, not of a best life. This negative dialectical\nvision makes Bloch not a Hegelian of a system (indeed, he attacked\n\u201cthe system\u201d when it was associated with East European\n\u201csocialist\u201d unfreedom), but a Hegelian of a promise.\n",
