Linguistic Methodology and Data\n\nThe strengths and limitations of different data gathering methods\nbegan to play an important role in linguistics in the early to\nmid-20th century. Voegelin and Harris (1951: 323) discuss several\nmethods that had been used to distinguish Amerindian languages and\ndialects:\n\nInformal elicitation: asking an informant for a\nmetalinguistic judgment on an expression. [E.g., \u201cIs this\nsentence grammatical?\u201d \u201cDo these two sentences mean the\nsame thing?\u201d]\nCorpus collection: gathering a body of naturally\noccurring utterances.\nControlled experimentation: testing informants in\nsome way that directly gauges their linguistic capacities.\n\n\nThey note that the anthropological linguists Boas and Sapir (who we\ntake to be proto-Emergentists) used the \u2018ask the\ninformant\u2019 method of informal elicitation, addressing questions\n\u201cto the informant\u2019s perception rather than to the data\ndirectly\u201d (1951: 324). Bloomfield (the proto-Externalist), on\nthe other hand, worked on Amerindian languages mostly by collecting\ncorpora, with occasional use of monolingual elicitation.\n\nThe preferred method of Essentialists today is informal elicitation,\nincluding elicitation from oneself. Although the techniques for\ngathering data about speakers and their language use have changed\ndramatically over the past 60 or more years, the general strategies\nhave not: data is still gathered by elicitation of metalinguistic\njudgments, collection of corpus material, or direct psychological\ntesting of speakers\u2019 reactions and behaviors. Different\nlinguists will have different preferences among these techniques, but\nit is important to understand that data could be gathered in any of\nthe three ways by advocates of any tendency. Essentialists,\nEmergentists, and Externalists differ as much on how data is\ninterpreted and used as on their views of how it should be\ngathered.\n\nA wide range of methodological issues about data collection have been\nraised in linguistics. Since gathering data by direct objective\nexperimental testing of informants is a familiar practice throughout\nthe social, psychological, medical, and biological sciences, we will\nsay little about it here, focusing instead on these five issues about\ndata:\n\nDisputes over the use of linguistic intuitions as linguistic\ndata;\nDifferences between grammaticality and acceptability\njudgments;\nDifferences between scales for measuring acceptability\njudgments;\nDebates about the reliability of informal judgment elicitation\nmethods; and\nIssues concerning the relevance and reliability of corpus\nevidence.\n\n",
