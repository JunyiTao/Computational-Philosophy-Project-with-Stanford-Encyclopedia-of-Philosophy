    "main_text": "Different Philosophical Projects || The Fit with Physics\n1.2 The Fit with Physics\n\nWoodward (2014) distinguishes \u201chow does causation fit with\nphysics\u201d as a separate philosophical project on a par with the\nmetaphysical, descriptive, and functional projects. Yet the question\nconcerning the fit with physics is best thought of as a question to\nbe addressed within each of the three projects. Indeed, philosophical\ndiscussions examining the fit of causal notions with physics can\nbenefit from distinguishing carefully\u2014and perhaps more carefully\nthan it is often done\u2014among the different projects within which\nthe discussions take\n place.[2]\n\nThe fit with physics question seems unavoidable for the\nmetaphysical project more generally: if a certain\nmetaphysical account could be shown to be incompatible with the\nfundamental physical theories we accept, then this would constitute a\nreason for rejecting the account, since compatibility with physics\narguably is a condition of adequacy for any metaphysical account of\ncausation.\n\nFor any metaphysical account compatible with physics the\nquestion arises, what the truth-makers of causal claims are or what\ngrounds these claims. There are three options: (i) either the truth-makers of causal claims\nare physical features of the world, (ii) or they supervene on physical\nfeatures of the world, (iii) or they are non-physical features of the\nworld that do not supervene on physical features of the world. If the\ntruth-makers of causal claims are either physical features or\nsupervene on such features, then the metaphysical account is\ncompatible with the thesis of the completeness of the physical. On the\nthird option, however, the account is incompatible with the\ncompleteness of the physical.\n\nCausal eliminativists argue that there is no metaphysical\naccount of causation compatible with physics or compatible with the\ncompleteness of physics and, hence, that causal notions should, as\nBertrand Russell (1912) urged, be expunged from the philosophical\nvocabulary. Causal non-eliminativists who are also causal\nnon-fundamentalists can come in various stripes. Some\nnon-fundamentalists allow that non-fundamental causal concepts can be\na legitimate part of at least some domains of physics. Other\nnon-fundamentalists deny the latter claim and reject that causal\nnotions and causal judgements can play a legitimate role within\nphysics. John Norton is a non-fundamentalist who appears to be\nendorsing the former view, arguing that while causal fundamentalism is\nfalse \u201cin appropriately restricted circumstances our science\nentails that nature will conform to one or other form of our causal\nexpectations\u201d (Norton 2003: 13). Yet Norton also seems to have\nsome sympathies for causal eliminativism, since he likens causal\nconcepts to the concept of caloric\u2014a concept that no longer is\naccepted as playing a legitimate role in science.\n\nWithin the descriptive project we can distinguish two\ndifferent ways of engaging with the fit-with-physics question. Most\nobviously (and what is more prominent in the philosophical literature)\nwe can propose a conceptual analysis of our intuitive, commonsense\nnotion of cause and then ask whether and to what extent the analysans\nalso plays a legitimate role in physics. For example, we might ask to\nwhat extent Lewis\u2019s notion of causal dependence analyzed in\nterms of time-asymmetric counterfactual dependence plays a role in\nreasoning in physics. As we will see below, prominent arguments\ndenying that causal notions fit with physics are most plausibly\nunderstood as engaging in this version of a descriptive project.\n\nAlternatively, a descriptive project may take physicists\u2019 own\nwidespread use of causal notions, both in research articles and in\nphysics textbooks, as its starting point and proposes an analysis of\nthe underlying causal concepts. Fritz Rohrlich\u2019s proposal that\ncausality has three different meanings in classical physics arguably\nis an example of this project. According to Rohrlich the three\nmeanings are: \n\n\n(a) predictability or Newtonian causality, (b) restriction of signal\nvelocities to those not exceeding the velocity of light, and (c) the\nabsence of \u201cadvanced\u201d effects of fields with finite\npropagation velocity. (2007: 50) \n\n\nthe last of which concerns the temporal asymmetry of causation. To\nsome extent Yemima Ben-Menahem (2018) also engages in this project,\nwhen she argues that the concepts of determinism, stability, locality,\nsymmetry and conservation law are all causal concepts.\n\nSimilarly, we can distinguish two approaches to the fit-with-physics\nquestion within the functional project. For one, we may\nexamine whether certain causal concepts that play useful cognitive\nroles in everyday contexts or in the special sciences also afford a\nlegitimate role to causal reasoning in physics. Woodward\n (2007) takes this approach to the\nfunctional project and explores to what extent interventionist causal\nconcepts that play an essential role in how we navigate the world fit\nwith theorizing in physics. Alternatively, we can take the practices\nof physical theorizing and model-building as starting points and\nexamine whether we can \u201cengineer\u201d causal concepts that\nfulfil certain cognitive functions within these contexts. Ben-Menahem\n(2018) is one of very few philosophers who take this approach to the\nfunctional project.\n",
