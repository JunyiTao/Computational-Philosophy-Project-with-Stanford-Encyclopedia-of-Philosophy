    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein on Mathematics: Some Preliminaries || Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Finitistic Constructivism\n3.2 Wittgenstein\u2019s Later Finitistic Constructivism\n\nThough commentators and critics do not agree as to whether the later\nWittgenstein is still a finitist and whether, if he is, his finitism\nis as radical as his intermediate rejection of unbounded mathematical\nquantification (Maddy 1986: 300\u2013301, 310), the overwhelming\nevidence indicates that the later Wittgenstein still rejects the\nactual infinite (RFM V, \u00a721; Zettel \u00a7274,\n1947) and infinite mathematical extensions.\n\nThe first, and perhaps most definitive, indication that the later\nWittgenstein maintains his finitism is his continued and consistent\ninsistence that irrational numbers are rules for constructing finite\nexpansions, not infinite mathematical extensions. \u201cThe\nconcepts of infinite decimals in mathematical propositions are not\nconcepts of series\u201d, says Wittgenstein (RFM V,\n\u00a719), \u201cbut of the unlimited technique of expansion of\nseries\u201d. We are misled by \u201c[t]he extensional definitions\nof functions, of real numbers etc\u201d. (RFM V, \u00a735),\nbut once we recognize the Dedekind cut as \u201can extensional\nimage\u201d, we see that we are not \u201cled to\n\\(\\sqrt{2}\\) by way of the concept of a cut\u201d (RFM V,\n\u00a734). On the later Wittgenstein\u2019s account, there simply is\nno property, no rule, no systematic means\nof defining each and every irrational number intensionally,\nwhich means there is no criterion \u201cfor the irrational\nnumbers being complete\u201d (PR \u00a7181).\n\nAs in his intermediate position, the later Wittgenstein claims that\n\u2018\\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019 and \u201cinfinite series\u201d get their\nmathematical uses from the use of \u2018infinity\u2019 in ordinary\nlanguage (RFM II, \u00a760). Although, in ordinary language,\nwe often use \u2018infinite\u2019 and \u201cinfinitely many\u201d\nas answers to the question \u201chow many?\u201d, and though we\nassociate infinity with the enormously large, the principal\nuse we make of \u2018infinite\u2019 and\n\u2018infinity\u2019 is to speak of the unlimited\n(RFM V, \u00a714) and unlimited techniques\n(RFM II, \u00a745; PI \u00a7218). This fact is\nbrought out by the fact \u201cthat the technique of learning\n\\(\\aleph_0\\) numerals is different from the technique of learning\n100,000 numerals\u201d (LFM 31). When we say, e.g., that\n\u201cthere are an infinite number of even numbers\u201d we mean\nthat we have a mathematical technique or rule for generating even\nnumbers which is limitless, which is markedly different from\na limited technique or rule for generating a finite number of numbers,\nsuch as 1\u2013100,000,000. \u201cWe learn an endless\ntechnique\u201d, says Wittgenstein (RFM V, \u00a719),\n\u201cbut what is in question here is not some gigantic\nextension\u201d.\n\nAn infinite sequence, for example, is not a gigantic extension because\nit is not an extension, and \u2018\\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019 is not a\ncardinal number, for \u201chow is this picture connected with the\ncalculus\u201d, given that \u201cits connexion is not that\nof the picture | | | | with 4\u201d (i.e., given that\n\u2018\\(\\aleph_0\\)\u2019 is not connected to a (finite) extension)?\nThis shows, says Wittgenstein (RFM II, \u00a758), that we\nought to avoid the word \u2018infinite\u2019 in mathematics wherever\nit seems to give a meaning to the calculus, rather than acquiring its\nmeaning from the calculus and its use in the calculus. Once we see\nthat the calculus contains nothing infinite, we should not be\n\u2018disappointed\u2019 (RFM II, \u00a760), but simply\nnote (RFM II, \u00a759) that it is not \u201creally\nnecessary\u2026 to conjure up the picture of the infinite (of the\nenormously big)\u201d.\n\nA second strong indication that the later Wittgenstein maintains his\nfinitism is his continued and consistent treatment of\n\u2018propositions\u2019 of the type \u201cThere are three\nconsecutive 7s in the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d (hereafter\n \u2018PIC\u2019).[4]\n In the middle period, PIC (and its putative negation, \\(\\neg\\)PIC,\nnamely, \u201cIt is not the case that there are three consecutive 7s\nin the decimal expansion of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d) is not a\nmeaningful mathematical \u201cstatement at all\u201d (WVC\n81\u201382: note 1). On Wittgenstein\u2019s intermediate view,\nPIC\u2014like FLT, GC, and the Fundamental Theorem of\nAlgebra\u2014is not a mathematical proposition because we do\nnot have in hand an applicable decision procedure by which we can\ndecide it in a particular calculus. For this reason, we can only\nmeaningfully state finitistic propositions regarding the\nexpansion of \\(\\pi\\), such as \u201cThere exist three consecutive 7s\nin the first 10,000 places of the expansion of \\(\\pi\\)\u201d\n(WVC 71; 81\u201382, note 1).\n\nThe later Wittgenstein maintains this position in various passages in\nRFM (Bernays 1959: 11\u201312). For example, to someone who says that since \u201cthe\nrule of expansion determine[\\(s\\)] the series\ncompletely\u201d, \u201cit must implicitly determine all\nquestions about the structure of the series\u201d, Wittgenstein\nreplies: \u201cHere you are thinking of finite series\u201d\n(RFM V, \u00a711). If PIC were a mathematical\nquestion (or problem)\u2014if it were finitistically\nrestricted\u2014it would be algorithmically decidable, which it is\nnot (RFM V, \u00a721; LFM 31\u201332, 111, 170;\nWVC 102\u201303). As Wittgenstein says at (RFM V,\n\u00a79): \u201cThe question\u2026 changes its status, when it\nbecomes decidable\u201d, \u201c[f]or a connexion is made then, which\nformerly was not there\u201d. And if, moreover, one invokes\nthe Law of the Excluded Middle to establish that PIC is a mathematical\nproposition\u2014i.e., by saying that one of these \u201ctwo\npictures\u2026 must correspond to the fact\u201d (RFM V,\n\u00a710)\u2014one simply begs the question (RFM V,\n\u00a712), for if we have doubts about the mathematical status of PIC,\nwe will not be swayed by a person who asserts \u201cPIC \\(\\vee\n\\neg\\)PIC\u201d (RFM VII, \u00a741; V, \u00a713).\n\nWittgenstein\u2019s finitism, constructivism, and conception of\nmathematical decidability are interestingly connected at (RFM\nVII, \u00a741, par. 2\u20135).\n\n\nWhat harm is done e.g. by saying that God knows all\nirrational numbers? Or: that they are already there, even though we\nonly know certain of them? Why are these pictures not harmless?\n\nFor one thing, they hide certain problems.\u2014 (MS 124: 139; March\n16, 1944)\n\nSuppose that people go on and on calculating the expansion of \\(\\pi\\).\nSo God, who knows everything, knows whether they will have reached\n\u2018777\u2019 by the end of the world. But can his\nomniscience decide whether they would have reached\nit after the end of the world? It cannot. I want to say: Even God can\ndetermine something mathematical only by mathematics. Even for him the\nmere rule of expansion cannot decide anything that it does not decide\nfor us.\n\nWe might put it like this: if the rule for the expansion has been\ngiven us, a calculation can tell us that there is a\n\u20182\u2019 at the fifth place. Could God have known this, without\nthe calculation, purely from the rule of expansion? I want to say: No.\n(MS 124, pp. 175\u2013176; March 23\u201324, 1944)\n\n\nWhat Wittgenstein means here is that God\u2019s omniscience\nmight, by calculation, find that \u2018777\u2019 occurs at\nthe interval [\\(n,n+2\\)], but, on the other hand, God might go on\ncalculating forever without \u2018777\u2019 ever turning up. Since\n\\(\\pi\\) is not a completed infinite extension that can be\ncompletely surveyed by an omniscient being (i.e., it is not a fact\nthat can be known by an omniscient mind), even God has only the rule,\nand so God\u2019s omniscience is no advantage in this case\n(LFM 103\u201304; cf. Weyl 1921 [1998: 97]). Like us, with\nour modest minds, an omniscient mind (i.e., God) can only calculate\nthe expansion of \\(\\pi\\) to some \\(n\\)th decimal\nplace\u2014where our \\(n\\) is minute and God\u2019s \\(n\\) is\n(relatively) enormous\u2014and at no \\(n\\)th decimal place\ncould any mind rightly conclude that because\n\u2018777\u2019 has not turned up, it, therefore, will never turn\nup.\n",
