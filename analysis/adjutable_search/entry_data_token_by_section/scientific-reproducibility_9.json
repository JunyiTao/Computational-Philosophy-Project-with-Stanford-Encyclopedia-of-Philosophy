    "main_text": "Meta-Science: Establishing, Monitoring, and Evaluating the Reproducibility Crisis || Scientific Fraud\n2.5 Scientific Fraud\n\nA number of recent high-profile cases of scientific fraud have\ncontributed considerably to the amount of press around the\nreproducibility crisis in science. Often these cases (e.g., Diederik\nStapel in psychology) are used as a hook for media coverage, even\nthough the crisis itself has very little to do with scientific fraud.\n(Note also that the Questionable Research Practices above are not\ntypically counted as \u201cfraud\u201d or even \u201cscientific\nmisconduct\u201d despite their ethically dubious status.) For\nexample, Fang, Grant Steen, and Casadevall (2012) estimated that 43%\nof retracted articles in biomedical research are withdrawn because of\nfraud. However, roughly half a million biomedical articles are\npublished annually and only 400 of those are retracted (Oransky 2016,\nfounder of the website RetractionWatch), so this amounts to a very\nsmall proportion of the literature (approximately 0.1%). There are, of\ncourse, many cases of pharmaceutical companies exercising financial\npressure on scientists and the publishing industry that raise\nspeculation about how many undetected (or unretracted) cases there may\nstill be in the literature. Having said that, there is widespread\nconsensus amongst scientists in the field that the main cause of the\ncurrent reproducibility crisis is the current incentive structure in\nscience (publication bias, publish or perish, non-transparent\nstatistical reporting, lack of rewards for data sharing). Whilst this\nincentive structure can push some to scientific fraud, it appears to\nbe a very small proportion. \n",
