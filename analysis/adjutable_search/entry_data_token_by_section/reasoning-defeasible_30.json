In\nparticular, it is difficult for us to verify conclusively that any two\nrandomly selected facts are or are not causally related. It seems that\nin practice we apply something like Occam\u2019s razor, assuming that\ntwo randomly selected facts are not causally related unless we have\npositive reason for thinking otherwise. This invites the use of\nsomething like circumscription, minimizing the extension of the\npredicate causes. (This is in fact exactly what Fangzhen Lin\ndoes in his 1995 papers [Lin 1995].)\n\nOnce we have a set of tentative conclusions about the causal structure\nof the world, we can use Reichenbach\u2019s insight to enable us to\nlocalize the problem of reasoning by default in the presence of known\nabnormality. If a known abnormality is screened off from a\ndefault\u2019s rule\u2019s consequent by constituent of its\nantecedent, then the rule may legitimately be deployed. \n\nSince circumscription is itself a nonmonotonic logical system, there\nare at least two independent sources of nonmonotonicity, or\ndefeasibility: the minimization or circumscription of causal\nrelevance, and the application of defeasible causal laws and laws of\ninertia.\n\nA number of researchers in artificial intelligence have recently\ndeployed one version of circumscription (namely, the stable\nmodels of Gelfond and Lifschitz [1988]) to problems of causal\nreasoning, building on an idea of Norman McCain and Hudson\nTurner\u2019s [McCain and Turner 1997]. McCain and Turner employ\ncausal rules that specify when an atomic fact is adequately caused and\nwhen it is exogenous and not in need of causal explanation. They then\nassume a principle of universal causation, permitting only\nthose models that provide adequate causal explanations for all\nnon-exempt atomic facts, while in effect circumscribing the extension\nof the causally explained. This approach has been extended and applied\nby Giunchiglia, Lee, Lifschitz, McCain and Turner [2004], Ferraris\n[2007], and Ferraris, Lee, Lierler, Lifschitz and Yang [2012]. Joohyung\nLee and Yi Wang (Lee and Wang 2016) have focused on introducing\nrelative weights to the rules.\n",
