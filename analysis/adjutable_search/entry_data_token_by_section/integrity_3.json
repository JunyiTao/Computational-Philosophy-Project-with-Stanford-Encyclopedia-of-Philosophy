Integrity as Standing for Something\n\nThe self-integration and identity views of integrity see it as\nprimarily a personal matter: a quality defined by a person\u2019s\ncare of the self. Cheshire Calhoun argues that integrity is primarily\na social virtue, one that is defined by a person\u2019s relations to\nothers (Calhoun 1995). The social character of integrity is, Calhoun\nclaims, a matter of a person\u2019s proper regard for their own best\njudgement. Persons of integrity do not just act consistently with\ntheir endorsements, they stand for something: they stand up for their\nbest judgment within a community of people trying to discover what in\nlife is worth doing. As she puts it:\n\nPersons of integrity treat their own endorsements as ones that matter,\nor ought to matter, to fellow deliberators. Absent a special sort of\nstory, lying about one\u2019s views, concealing them, recanting them\nunder pressure, selling them out for rewards or to avoid penalties,\nand pandering to what one regards as the bad views of others, all\nindicate a failure to regard one\u2019s own judgment as one that\nshould matter to others. (Calhoun 1995, 258)\n\n\nOn Calhoun\u2019s view, integrity is a matter of having proper regard\nfor one\u2019s role in a community process of deliberation over what\nis valuable and what is worth doing. This, she claims, entails not\nonly that one stand up, unhypocritically, for one\u2019s best\njudgment, but also that one have proper respect for the judgment of\nothers.\n\nCalhoun\u2019s account of integrity promises to explain why it is\nthat the fanatic lacks integrity. It seems intuitively very plausible\nto distinguish between fanatical zeal and integrity, but the\nself-integration and identity views of integrity threaten to make the\nfanatic a paradigm case of a person of integrity. Fanatics integrate\ndesires and volitions of various orders in an intimidatingly coherent\npackage; they remain steadfastly true to their deepest commitments\nlike no others. On Calhoun\u2019s view of integrity, however, we can\nlocate a distinction between integrity and fanaticism. Fanatics lack\none very important quality that, on Calhoun\u2019s view, is centrally\nimportant to integrity: they lack proper respect for the deliberations\nof others. What is not clear in Calhoun\u2019s account, and is in\nfact very hard to get clear on in any case, is what the\nproper respect for other\u2019s views in the end amounts to.\nExemplary figures of integrity often stand by their judgment in the\nface of enormous pressure to recant. How, then, is one to understand\nthe difference between standing up for one\u2019s views under great\npressure and fanatically standing by them? Calhoun\u2019s claim that\nthe fanatic lacks integrity because they fail to properly respect the\nsocial character of judgement and deliberation sounds right, but most\nof the work is done by the idea of \u2018proper\nrespect\u2019\u2014and it is not clear in the end what this comes\nto. It may be that integrity involves standing up for one\u2019s\nviews in a way that does not fully respect the differing views of\nothers. We therefore need an account of the difference between between\nfailing to respect the differing views of others (which is compatible\nwith integrity, and indeed sometimes required by it) and failing to\nproperly respect the differing views of others (something that it\nincompatible with integrity on Calhoun\u2019s account).\n\nOne way to expand upon Calhoun\u2019s account of integrity is to\nfurnish an epistemic conception of integrity. Greg Scherkoske (2011,\n2012a and 2012b, see also discussion in section 6 of this entry)\ndevelops such an account. According to Scherkoske \u201cIntegrity is\nan epistemic virtue: that is, it is a stable disposition that reliably\nplaces its possessor in good epistemic position and leads to cognitive\nsuccess\u201d (Scherkoske 2011, 196). Hugh Breakey (Breakey, 2016)\ndevelops an alternative to this approach. He argues that integrity is\na potentially dangerous trait in that possession of it can lead\nstrong-minded people to act without proper regard for the needs and\nperspectives of others. However, he argues, \u201cintegrity contains\nsubstantive moral principles that serve to surgically target the\ndangers that integrity would otherwise pose.\u201d (Breakey 2016,\n613) Integrity fits its possessor with what is required to act as a\nbenign deliberator in community with other deliberators. These are\nsubstantive rather than epistemic commitments implicit in the\npossession of integrity, and include such things as trustworthiness,\nnon-coercion, and sociability. In this way, Breakey proposes a morally\nsubstantive account of integrity that includes, not general kinds of\nmoral commitments, but specific commitments targeted at the dangers of\nbeing a self-directed and strong-minded individual. By contrast, the\nfollowing account of integrity is explicitly concerned with quite\ngeneral attitudes towards morality.\n",
