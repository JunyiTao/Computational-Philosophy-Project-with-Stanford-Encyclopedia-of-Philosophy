Political Thought\n\nScholars investigating Erasmus\u2019 political thought generally\nconsider the Institutio Principis Christiani (The Education\nof a Christian Prince, 1516) and the Panegyricus (Panegyric,\n1504 ) the main sources for his ideals (see Tracy 1978). For his views\non the legitimacy of warfare, they draw on the Querela Pacis\n(The Complaint of Peace, 1517) and the adage Dulce Bellum\nInexpertis (War is sweet to those who have not experienced it).\nThese sources are problematic, however, because of their strong\nrhetorical flavor and the commonplace nature of the arguments\npresented there. In fact it is possible to show a literal\ncorrespondence between passages in these works and the Copia,\nErasmus\u2019 textbook of style, and Erasmus himself acknowledges\nthat The Education of a Christian Prince is a collection of\naphorisms (CWE 27: 204). It will serve as an additional caveat to\nreaders that Erasmus, who is often depicted as a pacifist, also wrote\na piece in praise of war\u2014now lost, but documented in his\nCatalogue of Works (Ep. 1341A: 1455\u201357; CWE 9. I would not go so\nfar as to say that the (rhetorical) medium invalidates the message,\nbut it is important to support and reinforce any views expressed in\nErasmus\u2019 epideictic writings with passages in more cogently\nargued works, notably his theological and polemical tracts. There are\ntwo treatises, contained within psalm commentaries, which are relevant\nto Erasmus\u2019 pacifism: De Bello Turcico (On War Against\nthe Turks, 1530) and De Sarcienda Ecclesiae Concordia (On\nMending the Peace of the Church, 1533). Both recommend compromise and\narbitration as alternatives to warfare.\n\nErasmus first voices the idea of arbitration as a method of conflict\nresolution in The Education of a Christian Prince: \u201cIf\nsome dispute arises between princes, why do they not take it to\narbitration instead [of waging war]?\u201d (CWE 27: 183) He suggests\na committee of churchmen, magistrates, and scholars to settle the\ndispute. Similar ideas are voiced in Dulce Bellum. Why not\ncall on bishops, nobles, and councils as intermediaries to\n\u201csettle the childish disputes of princes by arbitration?\u201d\n(CWE 35: 430). We may take this to be an authentic Erasmian point of\nview because it appears not only in these rhetorical compositions but\nalso in his psalm commentary, De Concordia. There it is\npresented not merely as a general proposition but given a more\nspecific context. Erasmus suggests that the religious strife which\ncharacterized his age be settled by a general council of the\nchurch\u2014a desire also voiced in contemporary religious colloquies\nand Imperial Diets and realized after long delay in the Council of\nTrent. Erasmus furthermore counseled the parties to find a middle\nground and make concessions. He called this process\nsynkatabasis (CWE 65: 201), a military term denoting a move\nin which two armies give up their vantage point and descend into the\nopen plain to negotiate.\n\nErasmus does not entirely reject warfare, although he depicts it as a\nlast resource. In his rhetorical tracts he waxes eloquent about the\nhorrors of war and the destruction inflicted on the population. He\ncalls war fundamentally unchristian and fit for beasts rather than\nhumans. In his annotations on the New Testament (Luke 22: 36) he wrote\nin a more sober tone about war and the circumstances under which it\nwas legitimate. By that time Erasmus\u2019 pacifism and strong\nrejection of warfare had been called heretical, that is, at variance\nwith the accepted definition of just war. Erasmus amended his\nannotation accordingly. The expanded and finely nuanced version of\n1527 serves as clear testimony to his views on the subject. He begins\nby quoting St. Martin and St. Jerome condemning war. He then\nsuccinctly states his own opinion:\n\n\nWe should not propagate the Christian religion only with arms, nor\nshould princes undertake war when it can be avoided by using other\nmeans. They should, moreover, conduct a war they have undertaken with\na minimum of bloodshed and end it as quickly as possible. Finally,\n[war] is not compatible with the purity of the gospel, and we must not\nseek to derive the right to go to war from gospel\nprecepts\u2026There are many necessary evils in human affairs, which\nare tolerated because they prevent greater evils; yet they are not\napproved as gospel teaching. (ASD VI-5: 594)\n\n\nErasmus\u2019 praise of peace and concord is informed by the\nChristian ideal of a universal fellowship. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you\nwish [your neighbour] well as another man and a fellow\nChristian?\u201d he asks in The Complaint of Peace (CWE 27:\n315). The theme is also taken up in War Against the Turks.\nThere Erasmus concedes that the war against the Ottoman Empire is\n\u201cjust\u201d by the definition of the Church, but disparages a\nmilitary solution and promotes instead the idea of using spiritual\nweapons. He depicts the Turks as a scourge of God (an idea promoted\nalso by Luther) and therefore urges his contemporaries to repent and\nreform to appease God and overcome the enemy.\n\nThe Institutio Principis and the Panegyricus are\naddressed to Charles (later Emperor Charles V) and his father Philip\nrespectively. They belong to the genre of Mirror of Princes, in which\nthe ideal of a ruler is held up as a model to be imitated. The\nErasmian model prince is a father figure who has the wellbeing of his\npeople at heart. He is the guardian of justice and provides moral\nleadership. He is God\u2019s representative and as such owed\nobedience. Conversely, the ruler must give an account of his\nstewardship to God. Although \u201cit is pretty well agreed among the\nphilosophers that the most healthy form [of government] is\nmonarchy\u201d, Erasmus believes that monarchy should be\n\u201cchecked and diluted with a mixture of aristocracy and democracy\nto prevent it ever breaking out into tyranny\u201d (CWE 27: 231). It\nis not entirely clear what Erasmus meant by \u201cdemocracy\u201d.\nIt may be no more than a loose reference to the cooperation of the\nsubjects with their ruler. The best situation is for people to obey\nvoluntarily, Erasmus says (CWE 27: 236). Alternatively he may be\nthinking of the historical roots of kingship when he says that\n\u201cit takes general agreement to make a prince\u201d and\n\u201cgovernment depends to a large extent on the consent of the\npeople, which was what created kings in the first place\u201d (CWE\n27: 284). Some of the qualifications and limitations he imposes on\nabsolute monarchy are based on the Christian ideals of charity and\nfellowship. Echoing Plato, Erasmus believes that the best ruler must\nbe a philosopher, that is, a wise man,\n\n\nnot someone who is clever at dialectics or science but someone who\nrejects illusory appearance and undauntedly seeks out and follows what\nis true and good.\n\n\nBeing a philosopher is in practice the same as being a Christian, he\nnotes (CWE 27: 214). The ruler must not shirk his moral obligations.\n\u201cPower without goodness is unmitigated tyranny\u201d (CWE 27:\n220). In an even more radical tone, Erasmus declares: \u201cIf you\ncannot defend your kingdom without violating justice\u2026then\nabdicate\u201d (CWE 27: 217).\n\nThe prince\u2019s rights need to be balanced against the welfare of\nhis people.\n\n\nThe good prince uses the public interest as a yardstick in every\nfield, otherwise he is no prince. He has not the same rights over men\nas over cattle. (CWE 27: 284)\n\n\nThe duties and obligations are mutual. Neither the ruler nor his\nsubjects are above the law: \u201cThe happiest situation arises when\nthe prince is obeyed by all and himself obeys the laws\u201d (CWE 27:\n264). Many of the ideas voiced in The Education of the Christian\nPrince also appear in the Panegyric, but are expressed\nthere in more fulsome terms and, to the modern ear, with excessive\nflattery. The message is the same, however. The prince is God\u2019s\nrepresentative and his steward and \u201cought never to take his eyes\noff his model, \u2026Christ, the prince of princes\u201d (CWE 27:\n56\u20137).\n\nDescribing the hierarchy preserved in the ideal state, Erasmus draws\non the traditional medieval image of the three estates\u2014clergy,\nnobility, and common people\u2014arranged in three concentric circles\naround the central figure of Christ. This suggests a political and\nmoral hierarchy with specific duties assigned to each tier. While\neveryone \u201caccording to the measure that is given him must strive\nupwards toward Christ\u201d, the hierarchical arrangement also\ninvolves a responsibility to those in the tier below. Explaining the\nimage, Erasmus notes that this monarchic order is divinely instituted,\nand those who fight it, \u201cfight against God its author\u201d\n(CWE 42: 74). Thus kings, the representatives of Christ, must be\nobeyed even if they are corrupt,\n\n\nbecause they administer public justice and because God is justice;\nthey are the ministers of God and in a way rule for him as long as\nthey apply their efforts to the mandate given them by public\nauthority. (CWE 42: 75)\n\n\nIndeed, \u201cOrder is a good in itself\u201d (CWE 42: 74). There\nare multiple roots for the idea of mutual obligations among the\nmembers of a society. It is the foundation of the Medieval feudal\nsystem and embedded in the paternalistic biblical model. It also\nresembles the virtue of justice as defined in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic, with each member of society maintaining their\nproper place and a higher position entailing higher moral authority\nand corresponding responsibilities.\n\nOutlining his ideals, Erasmus thus makes use of concepts found in\nclassical philosophers and Christianizes or adapts them to specific\nrhetorical needs. The persistence of key elements in his thought over\na lifetime and in diverse literary genres would indicate that these\nideas, even if they fall short of a philosophy, developed into a habit\nof mind that can be labeled \u201cErasmian\u201d. This applies more\nparticularly to his views on pietas.\n",
