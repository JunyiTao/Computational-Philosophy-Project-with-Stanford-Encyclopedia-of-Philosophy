    "main_text": "Physical Computability\n4. Physical Computability\n\nAccording to the Church-Turing thesis (CTT), any function that is\nintuitively computable is computable by some TM (i.e.,\nTuring-computable). Alternatively, CTT may be formulated as the thesis\nthat any function \u201cnaturally regarded as computable\u201d\n(Turing 1936\u20137, 135) is Turing-computable. The phrases\n\u201cintuitively computable\u201d and \u201cnaturally regarded as\ncomputable\u201d are somewhat ambiguous. When they are disambiguated,\nCTT takes different forms.\n\nIn one sense, \u201cintuitively computable\u201d means computable by\nfollowing an algorithm or effective procedure. An effective procedure\nis a finite list of clear instructions for generating new symbolic\nstructures out of old symbolic structures; an example would be\ndividing two numbers according to the long division algorithm, using\nonly paper and pencil. When CTT is interpreted in terms of effective\nprocedures, it may be called Mathematical CTT, because the\nrelevant evidence is more logical or mathematical than physical.\nMathematical CTT says that any function computable by an effective\nprocedure is Turing-computable.\n\nThere is compelling evidence for Mathematical CTT (Kleene 1952,\n\u00a762, \u00a767; cf. also Sieg 2006):\n\nThere are no known counterexamples.\nDiagonalization over Turing machines, contrary to what may be\nexpected, does not yield a function that is not\nTuring-computable.\nThe argument from confluence: all the formalisms proposed to\ncapture the intuitive notion of computability by effective\nprocedure\u2014formalisms such as general recursiveness (G\u00f6del\n1934), \u03bb-definability (Church 1932, Kleene 1935),\nTuring-computability (Turing 1936-7), and reckonability (G\u00f6del\n1936)\u2014turn out to capture the same class of functions.\nA Turing machine seems capable of reproducing any operation that a\nhuman being can perform while following an effective procedure (Turing\n1936\u20137\u2019s main argument for CTT).\n\n\nIn another sense, \u201cintuitively computable\u201d means\ncomputable by physical means. When CTT is so interpreted, it may be\ncalled Physical CTT (following Pitowsky 1990), because the\nrelevant evidence is more physical than logical or mathematical.\n",
