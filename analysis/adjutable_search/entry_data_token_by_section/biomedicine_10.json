    "main_text": "Epistemology of Biomedicine || Reductionism in epistemology of biomedicine\n3.4 Reductionism in epistemology of biomedicine\n\nIn biomedicine, it appears much of medicine is reduced to applied\nbiology\u2014patients are just biochemical substances processes and\nmedical knowledge is just a complicated form of biological knowledge.\nKeating and Cambrosio see the relationship between this reductionism\nin biomedicine (the reducing of medicine to biology) as more a matter\nof the two being aligned for complex historical and philosophical\nreasons, instead of that reductionism being philosophically central to\nbiomedicine (Keating & Cambrosio 2003). According to them, after\nWorld War Two, the fields of biology and pathology negotiated the\ncreation of \u201cthe institutional and epistemic hybrid we call\nbiomedicine,\u201d and neither component of this hybrid rules the\nother (Keating & Cambrosio 2003, p. 368). They see this as\nundermining claims of biomedicine being reductionist because such\nassertions implicitly or explicitly mean that (micro)biology gets\nepistemic priority because it is the true and stable foundation.\n\nPart of the challenge is that there are multiple varieties of\n Reductionism in Biology.\n And there are a number of different reductionism disputes in biology,\nand the overlaps with biomedicine vary\u2014e.g., Rosenberg\u2019s\ndefense of reductionism in genetics overlaps with biomedicine in the\narea of medical genetics (Rosenberg 2006). As discussed in\n Section 1,\n it is very difficult to tell the difference between the core\ncomponents of biomedicine and the bits of\nphilosophy/technology/sociology that aren\u2019t inherently part of\nbiomedicine, but have gotten tangled up in it. The rationale for\nreductionism in biomedicine is explained with great care by\nAndersen:\n\n\nBeing able to successfully take a disease as complex as sickle cell\nanemia or Parkinson\u2019s and reduce it to a single genetic error\nthat cascades through various systems, even if that reduction holds\nfor only a proper subset of cases, illustrates that reduction can be a\npowerful tool for research and explanation in medicine. It cannot be\nthe only tool in the toolkit, since some diseases or dysfunctions may\nbe only partially reducible, or for which only some cases are\nreducible. But it is a good working assumption, as Oppenheim and\nPutnam put it, in tackling a problem with an unknown etiology, to look\nfor ways to reduce it to a few or even a single causal driver at a\nmolecular level (Andersen 2016: 86).\n\n\nIn other words, the potential for success and record of prior\nsuccesses is an argument for at least operating under the assumption\nthat biomedical scholars ought to continue treating biomedical\nmysteries as biochemical puzzles for which the relevant pieces have\nnot yet been identified or assembled.\n\nReductionism in biomedicine has been targeted by some committed\ncritics. For instance, Marcum explains that the process of reducing\nthe body to such component parts yields a vision of the body as\nmachine, a radically dehumanizing move.\n\n\nFrom the biomechanical point of view, the patient\u2019s body is\noften perceived as a material object that can be reduced to a system\nof physical parts. That body is viewed as a machine composed of\nindividual body parts, which can be fixed or exchanged with new parts,\nwhen broken. By reducing the patient\u2019s body to an assemblage of\nbody parts, the patient qua person vanishes (Marcum 2005:\n318).\n\n\nWhile the critique stands on its own, it remains an open question what\nother view ought to be adopted if not a reductionist biomechanical\none. Marcum contrasts the view most directly to phenomenological\nviews\u2014which will be discussed in\n Section 5\u2014arguing\n that a phenomenological approach is better suited to advancing\nmedicine, which he presents as being in a state of crisis.\n\nEBM\u2019s reliance on randomized control trials as a cornerstone of\nhealth data collection doubles down on the general reductionism of\nbiomedicine. Randomized control trials assume that health variables\ncan be observed, manipulated and controlled as largely independent\nunits. Yet, is a well-established problem that we simply don\u2019t\nknow all of the variables that might confound a clinical experiment\n(Worrall 2007), so randomization can at most hope that the\n\u2018confounders\u2019 (e.g., unknown dietary factors that affect\nmetabolization of a drug) are randomly distributed between the\ndifferent treatment populations in an experiment. Taking the\nreductionism a step further, the goal of exactly measuring the\ndifferences between Treatment A and Treatment B\nrequires EBM to only look for effects that are precisely measurable in\nthe first place. This limitation is a deeply-rooted problem since even\nthe official list of clinical signs and symptoms of a given disease\ncan diverge from accumulated patient observations, and in cases such\nas some psychiatric conditions, the symptoms\u2014or lack\nthereof\u2014are overtly difficult to measure or factor into an\nassessment of treatment efficacy (e.g., one\u2019s sense of self\nand/or emotional life) (Kendler 2016).\n\nWhile reductionist and antireductionist approaches are in direct\nopposition, it is possible to take a pluralistic stance toward them:\nboth can be welcomed into health science. For instance, this is the\nposition taken by Campaner (2010). Though, as discussed in the next\nsection, the power of the biomedical institution makes it such that\nbiomechanical reductionist approaches can easily overwhelm alternative\nviews.\n",
