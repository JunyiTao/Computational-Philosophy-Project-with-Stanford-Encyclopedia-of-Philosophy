    "main_text": "Introduction: The Question and the Strategy || The Nature of the Question\n1.1 The Nature of the Question\n\n\nIn Book One, the Republic\u2019s question first emerges in the \nfigure of Cephalus. After Socrates asks his host what it is like \nbeing old (328d\u2013e) and rich (330d)\u2014rather rude, we might \nthink\u2014Cephalus says that the best thing about wealth is that it can \nsave us from being unjust and thus smooth the way for an agreeable \nafterlife (330d\u2013331b). This is enough to prompt more questions, for \nSocrates wants to know what justice is. Predictably, Cephalus and \nthen Polemarchus fail to define justice in a way that survives \nSocratic examination, but they continue to assume that justice is a \nvaluable part of a good human life. Thrasymachus erupts when he has \nhad his fill of this conversation (336a\u2013b), and he challenges the \nassumption that it is good to be just. On Thrasymachus\u2019 view (see \nespecially 343c\u2013344c), justice is conventionally established by the \nstrong, in order that the weak will serve the interests of the \nstrong. The strong themselves, on this view, are better off \ndisregarding justice and serving their own interests directly.\n\n\nSocrates sees in this \u201cimmoralist\u201d challenge the explicit\nquestion of whether one should live a just or unjust life (344d\u2013e),\nand he tries repeatedly to repel Thrasymachus\u2019 onslaught. (See the entry on \n Callicles and Thrasymachus.) Eventually,\nThrasymachus withdraws sullenly, like Callicles in\nthe Gorgias, but Socrates\u2019 \u201cvictory\u201d fails to\nsatisfy Glaucon and Adeimantus. The brothers pick up where\nThrasymachus left off, providing reasons why most people think that\njustice is not intrinsically valuable but worth respecting only if one\nis not strong enough (or invisible enough) to get away with\ninjustice. They want to be shown that most people are wrong, that\njustice is worth choosing for its own sake.  More than that, Glaucon\nand Adeimantus want to be shown that justice is worth\nchoosing regardless of the rewards or penalties bestowed on\nthe just by other people and the gods, and they will accept this\nconclusion only if Socrates can convince them that it is\nalways better to be just. So Socrates must persuade them \nthat the just person who is terrifically unfortunate and scorned \nlives a better life than the unjust person who is so successful that \nhe is unfairly rewarded as if he were perfectly just (see 360d\u2013361d).\n\n\nThe challenge that Glaucon and Adeimantus present has baffled modern \nreaders who are accustomed to carving up ethics into deontologies \nthat articulate a theory of what is right independent of what is good\nand consequentialisms that define what is right in terms of what \npromotes the good (Foster 1937, Mabbott 1937, cf. Prichard 1912 and 1928). The insistence that justice be praised \u201citself by \nitself\u201d has suggested to some that Socrates will be offering a \ndeontological account of justice. But the insistence that justice be \nshown to be beneficial to the just has suggested to others that \nSocrates will be justifying justice by reference to its consequences.\n\n\nIn fact, both readings are distortions, predicated more on what modern\nmoral philosophers think than on what Plato thinks. Socrates takes the\nbasic challenge to concern how justice relates to the just person\u2019s\nobjective success or happiness (Greek eudaimonia). In Book\nOne, he argued that justice, as a virtue, makes the soul perform its\nfunction well and that a person who lives well is \u201cblessed and\nhappy\u201d (352d\u2013354a, quoting 354a1). At the beginning of Book Two,\nhe retains his focus on the person who aims to be happy. He says,\n\u201cI think that justice belongs in the best class [of goods], that\nwhich should be loved both for its own sake and for the sake of its\nconsequences by anyone who is going to be blessed\u201d\n(358a1\u20133). Given this perspective, Socrates has to show that smartly\npursuing one\u2019s happiness favors being just (which requires always\nacting justly) over being unjust (which tolerates temptation to\ninjustice and worse), apart from the consequences that attend to the\nappearance of being just or unjust. But he does not have to show that\nbeing just or acting justly brings about happiness. The\nfunction argument in Book One suggests that acting justly is the same\nas being happy. If Socrates stands by this identity, he can\nsimultaneously show that justice is valuable \u201citself by\nitself\u201d and that the just are happier.\n\n\nBut the function argument concludes that justice is both necessary \nand sufficient for happiness (354a), and this is a considerably \nstronger thesis than the claim that the just are always happier than \nthe unjust. After the challenge Glaucon and Adeimantus present, \nSocrates might not be so bold. Even if he successfully maintains that acting justly is identical to being happy, he might think that there are circumstances in which no just person could act justly and thus be happy. This will nonetheless satisfy Glaucon and \nAdeimantus if the just are better off (that is, closer to happy) than\nthe unjust in these circumstances. (See also Kirwan 1965 and Irwin 1999.)\n",
