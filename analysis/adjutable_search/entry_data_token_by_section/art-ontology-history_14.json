    "main_text": "What sorts of entities are works of art? || Norm-kinds\n3.4 Capacities, artifacts, and actions\n\nOne family of views on the ontological status of works of art finds\nits orientation in a longstanding conception of the arts in\ngeneral. The word \u2018art\u2019 derives from the Latin\n\u2019ars\u2019, which is often taken as translating the Greek term\n\u2018techn\u0113\u2019, which covered various sorts of practical\ncapacities or powers. The word derived from the Indo-European root\n\u2018tek\u2019, meaning to put together the woodwork of a house; a\n\u2018tekton\u2019 was a carpenter (Angier 2010, 1). Carpentry is\nsomething that cannot be done without some skill, and to become good\nat the art of carpentry requires training and practice. To exercise an\nart or craft is to activate a power to bring things about that\notherwise would not have happened. In this vein Aristotle declares in\nhis Metaphysics that \u201call arts, i.e. all productive\nforms of knowledge are potentialities; they are principles of change\nin another thing or in the artist himself considered as other\u201d\n(Met. 1046a36\u20131046b4). In Nicomachean Ethics\nhe remarks that \u201csince building is an art and is essentially a\nreasoned state of capacity to make, and there is neither any art that\nis not such a state nor such a state that is not an art), art\nis identical with a state of capacity to make, involving a true course\nof reasoning\u201d (Nic. Eth., 1140a6\u20131140a11).\n\nThat the arts are a matter of the rational production and judgement of\nartifacts was widely accepted by medieval thinkers (for background,\nsee Eco 1988, 164\u2013165). For example, in the discussion of\niconoclasm and idolatry in the Opus Caroli regis contra\nsynodum (ca. 794), Theodulf of Orl\u00e9ans characterized\npictures as manufacta (Noble 2009, 227, 347). Claims of this\nsort stood in opposition to Byzantine beliefs in such things\nas acheiropoeitoi, or miraculous sacred images not created by\nmortal hands.\n  \n\nNo doubt with Aristotle in mind, in his Summa Theologica\n(1912, I-II, 57, 4c) Thomas Aquinas defined \u2018art\u2019 as right reason in\nthe making of things (ars est recta ratio factibilium). In\n(1744, 7) James Harris identified art as \u201can habitual power in\nman of becoming the cause of some effect, according to a system of\nvarious and well-approved precepts.\u201d Kant in turn identified a\nwork or opus as the product of a doing [Tun]\n(facere), to which he contrasted the effects of nature, such\nas a beehive. Only what is the product of the exercise of a capacity\nto choose [eine Willk\u00fcr] is art (2000 [1790], 182\u2013183,\nparagraph 43). (For commentary on Kant\u2019s definitions of art and\nfine art, see Paul Guyer 1997.) Bolzano\u2019s (1849) essay on the\nnature and classification of works of art similarly begins with an\nemphasis on the necessity of the artist\u2019s intentional activity\nto the creation of a work. Various philosophers have more recently\nclassified works of art (or at least some works of fine art) as\nartifacts; examples include Marcia Eaton (1969), Gary Iseminger\n(1973), Denis Dutton (1979), Risto Hilpinen (1992, 1993), Thomasson\n(1999), and Levinson (2007) (for background, see the entry on\nartifacts). The next section is devoted to Levinson\u2019s influential\nproposal.\n3.4.1 Works of art as indicated structures\n\nLevinson advocates a \u201ccontextualism\u201d in aesthetics (2005),\nwhich is not to be confounded with the approach defended by Pepper\n(1937a, 1968, 1970) under the same label. In his (1980a, 1990)\nLevinson sets forth and defends an account of \u201cparadigm musical\nworks,\u201d i.e. fully notated compositions within Western\nculture. His proposal is motivated by the attempt to meet what he\ntakes to be three salient requirements on an adequate ontology of\nworks of this sort: creatability, fine individuation, and the\ninclusion of performance means.\n\n\nThe first requirement specifies that \u201cMusical works must be such\nthat they do not exist prior to the composer\u2019s compositional activity,\nbut are brought into existence by that activity\u201d (1980,\n68). Like Wolterstorff, Levinson allows that all possible sound-types,\nand patterns and sequences thereof, preexist anyone\u2019s compositional\nactivities. The creatability requirement must be compatible with this\nassumption, he maintains. The claim is not, then, that composers can\nbring musical structures into existence; what they can do, however, is\n\u201cindicate\u201d a structural type along with a performance\nmeans or manner of generating instances or tokens of sound sequences\nof that type. A musical work is, then, a relational entity of the sort\n\u201csound structure and performance-means as indicated by\nartist X at time t.\u201d. This sort of abstract\nitem, Levinson writes, \u201cdoes not preexist the activity of\ncomposition and is thus capable of being created\u201d (1980a, 79;\ncf. John Andrew Fisher 1991). Entities of this sort, it seems, only\ncome into existence through the actual event of indication performed\nby a person (or persons) in some context. Terms figuring alongside\n\u2018indicate\u2019 in Levinson\u2019s descriptions of what the artist\ndoes with the abstract object include \u2018discover\u2019,\n\u2018choose\u2019, and \u2018demonstrate\u2019 (1990). Levinson\nsays more about how he understands the difference between ordinary and\nartistic indication in his (2012).\n\n\nLevinson\u2019s fine individuation requirement springs from the intuition\nthat if two composers were to indicate the same sound-structure, they\nwould not thereby generate the same musical work. The contrary\nintuition had been forwarded by Meager (1958\u201359, 57\u201358) and\nWolterstorff (1975, 248); it was criticized in Walton (1977) and\nSavile (1971). Levinson entertains the possibility that the identity\nof the composer is not essential to the individuation of works;\nperhaps it is at least logically possible for a work to be composed by\na person other than the one who actually did so. Levinson explores the\nthesis that something like sameness of musical-historical context is a\nconstraint sufficient to satisfy the requirement of fine-grained\nindividuation.\n\nLevinson proposes, then, that some musical works may be classified as\n\u201cinitiated types,\u201d that is, types that are brought into\nbeing by an intentional action of indication performed upon a pure\nstructure. With regard to works of visual art, Levinson (1996) defends\nthe idea that at least some such works are physical objects as\nintended by the artist for a certain regard or treatment. The work is\nthe relational entity comprised of the object or structure and the\nartist\u2019s action in a context.\n\nCurrie objects that Levinson\u2019s ontological category, structure as\nindicated-by-artist at time t, is metaphysically obscure\n(1989, 58). Fleming discovered penicillin, but do we believe that in\nso doing he also created the entity,\npenicillin-as-discovered-by-Fleming? Levinson is explicitly committed\nto the idea that when the artist indicates or discovers or chooses an\nabstract structure, \u201csomething further comes into\nexistence,\u201d namely, an initiated type (1990, 262). Currie\u2019s\npoint is that if this is allowed, various unwanted ontological\ncommitments follow. A related criticism raised by Dodd (2000),\nPredelli (2001), and Alward (2004) is that indicating is not really a\nmatter of creating, and if this is correct, it follows that Levinson\u2019s\nproposal does not satisfy a sufficiently robust version of the first\nof his three requirements on an adequate ontology of the relevant\nsorts of works.\n\nCurrie also raises the objection that Levinson\u2019s account does not\nindividuate works adequately; this objection has been further pursued\nby David Davies (2004), and by Matheson and Caplan (2007). Lamarque\n(2010) contends that there is an indeterminacy as to which tokens are\nof a given indicated type.\n\nIn response to James Anderson\u2019s (1985) suggestion that Levinson\u2019s\nproposal could be amplified with reference to Wolterstorff\u2019s ideas\nabout norm-kinds, Levinson (1990) expresses reservations about the\nlatter, but adds that the notion that the artist makes certain\nfeatures normative for a work helps to explain in what indicating a\nstructure consists.\n3.4.2 Artworks as actions\n\nVarious philosophers have explored the idea that works should be\nclassified as actions or performances as opposed to the products or\nobjects that may result from such actions. Croce, Collingwood, and\nDewey are early and highly influential examples. In a remarkable\nreview of Dewey\u2019s aesthetics, Croce makes a list of familiar\nideas to be found in Dewey\u2019s work. One of these ideas, which he\nsays was formulated much earlier in Italy, is that \u201cthere are\nnot artistic \u2018things\u2019, but only an artistic doing, an\nartistic producing\u201d (1948, 205). Jeffrey Maitland (1975)\nsimilarly suggests that the work of art is a \u201cdoing\u201d, but\nalso declares that a work is a \u201cperformative presence.\u201d\nDenis Dutton writes that \u201cAs performances, works of art\nrepresent the ways in which artists solve problems, overcome\nobstacles, make do with available materials.\u201d (1979, 305). He\nadds in the same context that \u201cthe work of art has a human\norigin, and must be understood as such.\u201d\n\n\nSparshott (1980, 1982) conceives of a work as a performance, and more\nspecifically, as an action when it is conceived in a certain way,\nnamely, as the establishment of a design. Work identity is determined\nby both the nature of this design and the type of action that yielded\nit: same design and origin, same work.  Sparshott\u2019s evocation of\na unity of outcome and agency is complicated, however, by the fact\nthat he thinks in terms of reconstructed or idealized, nonfactual\nartistic intentions, as opposed to the actual intentions and actions\nof the artist or artists responsible for the production of a\n\u201csystem of qualities.\u201d\n\n\nCurrie (1989) proposes that all artworks belong to the category of\naction types. Works are types of events, then, and events are said by\nCurrie to be a \u201cnatural ontological category.\u201d Although\nCurrie says he wants to stay neutral on issues pertaining to the\nnature and individuation of events, he at least provisionally works\nwith Jaegwon Kim\u2019s (1976) conception of events as property\nexemplifications by an object or substance (or ordered n-tuple\nof objects/substances) at a time. As types, works could not themselves\nliterally be events, and Currie\u2019s event-types are individuated\nin ways that abstract from the \u201cconstitutive substance\u201d\nfiguring within Kim\u2019s basically Aristotelian perspective on\nevents.\n\n\nMore specifically, Currie\u2019s proposal is that a work is an action\ntype of the form: an agent, A, discovers a structure, s,\nvia a heuristic path, H, at a time, t.\n\n\nCurrie allows that the artist does not create the work of art.  Nor\ndoes the artist discover it. The artist can discover a preexisting\nabstract artistic structure, but the work is an action type that the\nartist \u201cperforms\u201d in so doing.\n\n\nCurrie explains that the heuristic path is the \u201cway in which the\nartist arrived at the final product.\u201d Neither a particular agent\nnor a specific time is essential to the action type that is the work\nof art: someone else could discover the same structure at a different\ntime yet instantiate the same work. Currie conjectures, for example,\nthat if \u201cPicasso\u2019s twin on \u2018Twin Earth\u2019\nproduces a canvas indistinguishable from\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica, and if he does so in the same way,\nthen Guernica and Twin Guernica are instances of the\nsame work\u201d (1989, 9). Currie also introduces a similar\nconjecture involving Beethoven, twin Beethoven, and twin tokens of the\nHammerklavier sonata.\n\n\nWolterstorff (1992) and Levinson (1992) complain that a\ncounterintuitive implication of Currie\u2019s proposal is that one\ncannot read a literary work. Levinson (1992) takes up the question of\nwork individuation and asks whether Beethoven and twin Beethoven\nreally make the same works, even though they act within qualitatively\nidentical cultures and come up with tokens of the same artistic\nstructure via qualitatively identical paths.\n\n\nQuestions have been raised (e.g., by Levinson 1992 and David Davies\n2004) about Currie\u2019s Lakatos-inspired notion of the\nartist\u2019s heuristic path, beginning with the obvious query as to\nwhat is and is not included in the \u201cway\u201d the artist\ndiscovers the structure. Currie allows that the path can include facts\nunknown to the artist if they are deemed relevant to the appreciation\nof his or her achievement. For example, even if Virginia Woolf did not\nknow of Marcel Proust\u2019s work when she wrote Jacob\u2019s\nRoom, she could \u201cin principle\u201d have known about it,\nand so Proust\u2019s prior inventions were part of her path and are\nrelevant to our understanding of Woolf\u2019s achievement.  Currie\nacknowledges that his notion of a heuristic path is vague, and he\nentertains the possibility that describing the heuristic of a work\n\u201cstarts to look like writing the history of the universe\u201d\n(1989, 72). Yet he optimistically predicts that there \u201cwill be\nwide agreement about how the idea is to be applied in particular\ncases\u201d (1989, 73). More specifically, he indicates that\n\u201ccase studies\u201d in the analysis of such heuristics can be\nfound in Michael Baxandall\u2019s (1985).\n\n\nIn his proposal for an alternative to contextualist ontologies of art,\nDavid Davies (2004, 2005) proposes that works of art are best\nclassified, not as indicated structures or as action types, but as\naction tokens. A work of art, then, is a \u2018doing\u2019 or\ngenerative performance. Davies further analyzes the latter as a\nsequence of \u201cmotivated manipulations of a vehicular medium\nthrough which a particular focus of appreciation is specified\u201d\n(2005a, 75). With regard to the bedeviled question of which factors in\nthe historical context of a work\u2019s creation do and do not\ndetermine the identity of the work (a question that is taken to be\ndistinct from the question as to which factors are in some broad sense\nrelevant to the work\u2019s understanding and appreciation), Davies\nidentifies what he calls the artist\u2019s \u201cprimary\nmotivation,\u201d which governs activities that specify an artistic\nvehicle that articulates a given artistic content. It is these\nart-content-articulating manipulations of artistic vehicles that\nqualify as elements in the performance that is identified with the\nwork. For example, whether an artist\u2019s intentional ingestion of\na drug during the making of the \u201cfocus of appreciation\u201d or\nproduct of the generative performance is to be counted as part of the\nwork depends, then, on whether this action is part of a manipulation\nof an artistic vehicle effectively designed to articulate some aspect\nof the work\u2019s content.\n\n\nDilworth (2005b) objects that Davies\u2019s basic contention to the\neffect that works are action tokens is incompatible with his claim\nthat works, conceived of as a particular generative performance, have\na kind of \u201cmodal flexibility,\u201d which means that the same\nwork could have had different properties (e.g., it could have been\ncreated a few minutes earlier or later, or in a significantly\ndifferent art-historical context). Davies argues that his performance\ntheory, unlike such rivals as the indicated structure theory, is\ncompatible with a work-relative modality. For an informative\ndiscussion of this topic, see Matheson and Caplan (2008).\n\n\nSome critics of Davies\u2019 account (Kania 2005, Stecker 2005) contend\nthat he provides insufficient grounds for the adoption of a highly\nrevisionary ontological doctrine that gives the lie to countless\nordinary statements about works of art, such as \u201cthe\nMona Lisa can be seen at the Louvre.\u201d This criticism\nechoes Mary McCarthy\u2019s remark in response to Harold\nRosenberg\u2019s proposal that action paintings are not pictures but\n\u201cevents\u201d: \u201cYou cannot hang an event on a wall, only\na picture\u201d (Rosenberg 1962, 5). Davies (or the proponent of any\nother ontological account that is incompatible with prevalent\npronouncements in ordinary language) may respond that the\nphilosopher\u2019s goal is not to ratify all casual and unreflective\nutterances about the arts, but to articulate a cogent (and possibly\nrevisionary) metaphysics. Davies in fact contends that his proposal is\nmeant to obey a \u201cpragmatic constraint\u201d to the effect that\n\u201cArtworks must be conceived ontologically in such a way as to\naccord with those features of our critical and appreciative practice\nupheld on rational reflection\u201d (2004, 23). This constraint is\npart of a larger argument that also rests on the following\n\u201cepistemological\u201d premise: \u201cRational reflection upon\nour critical and appreciative practice confirms that certain sorts of\nproperties, actual or modal, are rightly ascribed to what are termed\n\u2018works\u2019 in that practice, or that our practice rightly\nindividuates what are termed \u2018works\u2019 in a certain\nway\u201d (2004, 23).\n\n\nStecker (2009) argues that Davies\u2019s epistemological argument\ndoes not justify settling on the performance theory or any of the\nother rival ontological proposals. Stecker holds that the pragmatic,\nreferential core of our talk about musical works requires them to be\naudible, repeatable, and performable. This finding, he contends, is\ncompatible with contextualism, but not with Davies\u2019s own\nproposal.\n\n\nGiven that the practices in the spheres of art are contradictory,\nchanging, and influenced by cacophonous theorizing, the practices\nalone cannot tell us which aspects of practice are and are not\nindicative of reliable answers to art-ontological\nqueries. Consequently it is fair to ask how a philosopher\u2019s rational\nreflection on practice can lead to accurate answers to art-ontological\nquestions (Livingston 2005b). Two salient issues in this regard are\nhow sufficient evidence about art-related attitudes and behavior is to\nbe gathered by philosophers, and how this evidence can be interpreted\nin such a manner that it provides reliable support for general\nontological claims. Art-ontologists need a reliable, principled method\nwith which to select and interpret the practices that are meant to\nsupport their theories.\n",
