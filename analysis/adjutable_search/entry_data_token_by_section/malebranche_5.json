    "main_text": "Theodicy\n6. Moral Theory\n\nThe theocentrism that is evident in Malebranche\u2019s doctrines of\nthe vision in God and occasionalism would lead us to expect that God\nplays a central role in his moral theory. This expectation is borne\nout by his discussion in the Trait\u00e9 de morale. Indeed,\nMalebranche\u2019s two doctrines are present in that work. The vision\nin God is reflected in the insistence there that moral duties are\ndictated by \u201crelations of perfection\u201d revealed in\nGod\u2019s wisdom. As in the case of necessary truths concerning\nbody, so in the case of moral truths Malebranche unequivocally rejects\nCartesian voluntarism. The doctrine of occasionalism is reflected in\nMalebranche\u2019s insistence that God is our greatest good since He\nalone can cause our happiness. This point indicates that Malebranche\ntakes moral action to require a consideration not only of abstract\nrelations of perfection, but also the happiness of the self.\n\nMalebranche starts from the Augustinian position that morality\nconcerns the proper ordering of our love. Given the importance of\nhuman freedom for his theodicy, it is not surprising that Malebranche\ninsists that the love required for moral action involve the free\nexercise of the will. His version of the \u201cgood will\u201d is\none that freely strives to be guided in action by objective relations\nof perfection that hold among the various objects of love. God is the\nmost perfect being, and hence the most worthy of our love, while human\nbeings are more perfect than mere material beings, and thus more\nworthy of our love. When the intensity of our love matches the order\namong perfections, we have a right love that provides the basis for\nvirtue, that is, a habitual inclination to love objects according to\ntheir perfections.\n\nMalebranche holds that due to original sin, we are inclined not to\nright love directed by our perception of relations of perfection in\nGod\u2019s wisdom, but rather to a disordered love directed by bodily\npleasures deriving from the soul-body union. This is the counterpart\nto the disordered inclination of our will to make judgments about the\nnature of the material world that are based on sensations deriving\nfrom the union. For Malebranche, a corrective to both of these\ndisorders of the will is to attend to clear ideas that exist in\nGod.\n\nMalebranche sometimes suggested that disordered love of bodily\npleasure derives from self-love. Encouraged by this suggestion, one of\nhis followers, Fran\u00e7ois Lamy, claimed that his position leads\nto the quietist view in F\u00e9n\u00e9lon that moral conduct\nrequires a \u201cpure love of God\u201d that involves no concern for\nthe self or its pleasure. This position, which Lamy himself endorsed,\nwas later condemned by the Catholic Church, due in large part to a\ncampaign against F\u00e9n\u00e9lon directed by his critic,\nBossuet. But Malebranche insists that such a position directly\nconflicts with his own view that pleasure itself is a good that is\nrequired as a motive for action. When critics such as Arnauld and\nR\u00e9gis charge that this view results in hedonism, Malebranche\nresponds that it is only ordered pleasures that bring the greatest\ngood. This response is reflected in his claim to Lamy that a\ndisordered love of self is to be contrasted not with pure love of God,\nbut rather with an ordered love that seeks happiness in the\ncontemplation of the greatest good, God. In emphasizing the need for\nthis sort of love of God, Malebranche was returning to his view in the\npreface to the Recherche that it is through a union with God\nthat the mind \u201creceives its life, its light, and its entire\nfelicity.\u201d For more on Malebranche\u2019s engagement with\nquietism, see Montcheuil (1947). But cf. the critical evaluation of\nMontcheuil\u2019s decidedly pro-Malebranche view of this exchange\nwith Lamy in Dreyfus (1958), 318\u201322. There is a recent\ndiscussion of the relation of Malebranche to quietism in Walsh and\nLennon (2012).\n\nBardout (2000), 111\u201362, includes the argument that\nMalebranche\u2019s exchange with Lamy on pure love in fact marks a\ntransition in his thought from a \u201cmetaphysical morality\u201d\nthat stresses the purely intelligible nature of our moral end, to a\n\u201csensible morality\u201d that stresses a conception of that end\nin terms of the cause of our pleasure. However, this shift may not be\nas dramatic as in the case of Malebranche\u2019s conception of\nfreedom. For the view that God is our sole good insofar as He is the\nsole cause of our pleasure is present already in the first edition of\nthe Recherche (Malebranche [OC], 172\u201373). Even so,\nthere is reason to think that this view becomes increasingly important\nto Malebranche\u2019s moral theory.\n",
