    "main_text": "Abuses and Guidelines\n3. Abuses and Guidelines\n\nThe history of clinical research is littered with abuses. Indeed, one\naccount maintains that the history of pediatric research is\n\u201clargely one of child abuse\u201d (Lederer and Grodin 1994, 19;\nalso see Lederer 2003). This history has had a significant influence\non how research ethicists understand the concerns raised by clinical\nresearch and on how policy makers attempt to address them. In\nparticular, policy makers have responded to previous abuses by\ndeveloping guidelines intended to prevent their recurrence.\n\nThe most influential abuses in this regard were the horrific\nexperiments conducted by Nazi physicians during WW II (abuses\nperpetrated by Japanese physicians were also horrific, but have\nreceived significantly less attention). Response to these abuses led\nto the Nuremberg Code (Grodin & Annas 1996; Shuster 1997), which\nis frequently regarded as the first set of formal guidelines for\nclinical research, an ironic claim on two counts. First, there is some\ndebate over whether the Nuremberg Code was intended to apply generally\nto clinical research or whether, as a legal ruling in a specific\ntrial, it was intended to address only the cases before the court\n(Katz 1996). Second, the Germans themselves had developed systematic\nresearch guidelines as early as 1931 (Vollmann & Winau 1996).\nThese guidelines were still legally in force at the time of the Nazi\natrocities and clearly prohibited a great deal of what the Nazi\ndoctors did.\n\nWide consensus developed by the end of the 1950s that the Nuremberg\nCode was inadequate to the ethics of clinical research. Specifically,\nthe Nuremberg Code did not include a requirement that clinical\nresearch receive independent ethics review and approval. In addition,\nthe first and longest principle in the Nuremberg Code states that\ninformed consent is \u201cessential\u201d to ethical clinical\nresearch (Nuremberg Military Tribunal 1947). This requirement provides\na powerful safeguard against the abuse of research participants. It\nalso appears to preclude clinical research with individuals who cannot\nconsent.\n\nOne could simply insist that the informed consent of participants is\nnecessary to ethical clinical research and accept the opportunity\ncosts thus incurred. Representatives of the World Medical Association,\nwho hoped to avoid these costs, began meeting in the early 1960s to\ndevelop guidelines, which would become the Declaration of\nHelsinki, to address the perceived shortcomings of the Nuremberg Code\n(Goodyear, Krleza-Jeric, and Lemmens 2007). They recognized that\ninsisting on informed consent as a necessary condition for clinical\nresearch would preclude a good deal of research designed to find\nbetter ways to treat dementia and conditions affecting children, as\nwell as research in emergency situations. Regarding consent as\nnecessary precludes such research even when it poses only minimal\nrisks or offers participants a compensating potential for important\nclinical benefit. The challenge, still facing us today, is to identify\nprotections for research participants which are sufficient to protect\nthem without being so strict as to preclude appropriate research\ndesigned to benefit the groups to which they belong.\n\nThe Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Organization 1996) allows\nindividuals who cannot consent to be enrolled in clinical research\nbased on the permission of the participant\u2019s representative. The\nU.S. federal regulations governing clinical research take a similar\napproach. These regulations are not laws in the strict sense of being\npassed by Congress and applying to all research conducted on U.S.\nsoil. Instead, the regulations represent administrative laws which\neffectively attach to clinical research at the beginning and the end.\nResearch conducted using U.S. federal monies, for instance, research\nfunded by the NIH, or research involving NIH researchers, must follow\nthe U.S. regulations (Department of Health and Human Services 2005).\nResearch that is included as part of an application for approval from\nthe U.S. FDA also must have been conducted according to FDA\nregulations which, except for a few exceptions, are essentially the\nsame. Although many countries now have their own national regulations\n(Brody 1998), the U.S. regulations continue to exert enormous\ninfluence around the world because so much clinical research is\nconducted using U.S. federal money and U.S. federal investigators, and\nthe developers of medical treatments often want to obtain approval for\nthe U.S. market.\n\nThe abuses perpetrated as part of the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study\nwere made public in 1972, 40 years after the study was initiated. The\nresulting outcry led to the formation of the U.S. National Commission,\nwhich was charged with evaluating the ethics of clinical research with\nhumans and developing recommendations for appropriate safeguards.\nThese deliberations resulted in a series of recommendations for the\nconduct of clinical research, which became the framework for existing\nU.S. regulations. The U.S. regulations, like many regulations, place\nno clear limits on the risks to which competent and consenting adults\nmay be exposed. In contrast, strict limits are placed on the level of\nresearch risks to which those unable to consent may be exposed,\nparticularly children. In the case of pediatric research, the standard\nprocess for review and approval is limited to studies that offer a\n\u2018prospect of direct\u2019 benefit and research that poses\nminimal risk or a minor increase over minimal risk. Studies that\ncannot be approved in one of these categories must be reviewed by an\nexpert panel and approved by a high government official. While this\n4th category offers important flexibility, it implies that, at least\nin principle, U.S. regulations do not mandate a ceiling on the risks\nto which pediatric research participants may be exposed for the\nbenefit of others. This reinforces the importance of considering how\nwe might justify exposing participants to research risks, both minimal\nand greater than minimal, for the benefit of others.\n",
