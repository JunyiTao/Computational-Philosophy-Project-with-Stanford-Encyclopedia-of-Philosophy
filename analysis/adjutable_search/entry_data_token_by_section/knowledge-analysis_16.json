    "main_text": "Virtue-Theoretic Approaches\n10. Virtue-Theoretic Approaches\n\nThe virtue-theoretic approach to knowledge is in some respects similar\nto the safety and anti-luck approaches. Indeed, Ernest Sosa, one of\nthe most prominent authors of the virtue-theoretic approach, developed\nit from his previous work on safety. The virtue approach treats\nknowledge as a particularly successful or valuable form of belief, and\nexplicates what it is to be knowledge in such terms. Like the\nanti-luck theory, a virtue-theoretic theory leaves behind the JTB+\nproject of identifying knowledge with a truth-functional combination\nof independent epistemic properties; knowledge, according to this\napproach, requires a certain non-logical relationship between belief\nand truth.\n",
