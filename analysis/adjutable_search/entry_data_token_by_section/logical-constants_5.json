    "main_text": "Inferential characterizations\n6. Inferential characterizations\n\n\nAt the end of the section on topic neutrality, we distinguished two\nnotions of topic neutrality. The first notion\u2014insensitivity to\nthe distinguishing features of individuals\u2014is effectively\ncaptured by the permutation invariance criterion. How might we capture\nthe second\u2014universal applicability to all thought or reasoning,\nregardless of its subject matter? We might start by identifying certain\ningredients that must be present in anything that is to count as\nthought or reasoning, then class as logical any expression that can be\nunderstood in terms of these ingredients alone. That would ensure a\nspecial connection between the logical constants and thought or\nreasoning as such, a connection that would explain logic\u2019s universal\napplicability.\n\n\nAlong these lines, it has been proposed that the logical constants\nare just those expressions that can be characterized by a set of purely\ninferential introduction and elimination\n rules.[20]\n To grasp the meaning\nof the conjunction connective \\(\\dq{\\and}\\), for example, it is arguably\nsufficient to learn that it is governed by the rules:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{A, B}{A \\and B}\n\\quad\n\\frac{A \\and B}{A}\n\\quad\n\\frac{A \\and B}{B}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThus the meaning of \\(\\dq{\\and}\\) can be grasped by anyone who understands\nthe significance of the horizontal line in an inference rule. (Contrast\n\\(\\dq{\\%}\\) from the last section, which cannot be grasped by anyone who does\nnot understand what a male is and what a widow is.) Anyone who is\ncapable of articulate thought or reasoning at all should be able to\nunderstand these inference rules, and should therefore be in a position\nto grasp the meaning of \\(\\dq{\\and}\\). Or so the thought\n goes.[21]\n\n\nTo make such a proposal precise, we would have to make a number of\nadditional decisions:\n\n\n\n\nWe would have to decide whether to use natural deduction rules or\nsequent rules.  (See the entry on\nthe development of\n  proof theory.)\n\n\n\n\nIf we opted to use sequent rules, we would have to decide whether or\nnot to allow \u201csubstructure\u201d (see the entry on\n substructural logics)\n and whether to allow multiple conclusions in the sequents. We would\nalso have to endorse a particular set of purely structural rules\n(rules not involving any expression of the language essentially).\n\n\n\n\nWe would have to specify whether it is introduction or elimination\nrules, or both, that are to characterize the meanings of logical\nconstants.[22]\n (In a sequent formulation, we would have to\ndistinguish between right and left introduction and elimination\nrules.)\n\n\n\n\nWe would have to allow for subpropositional structure in our rules,\nin order to make room for quantifier rules.\n\n\n\n\nWe would have to say when an introduction or elimination rule counts\nas \u201cpurely inferential,\u201d to exclude rules like these:\n\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\frac{a~\\text{is red}}{Ra}\n\\quad\n\\frac{A, B, \\text{water is}~H_{2}O}{A * B}\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe strictest criterion would allow only rules in which every sign,\nbesides a single instance of the constant being characterized, is\neither structural (like the comma) or schematic (like \\(\\dq{A}\\)).\nBut although this condition is met by the standard rules for\nconjunction, it is not met by the natural deduction introduction rule\nfor negation, which must employ either another logical constant\n(\\(\\dq{\\bot}\\)) or another instance of the negation sign than the one being\nintroduced. Thus one must either relax the condition for being \u201cpurely\ninferential\u201d or add more structure (see especially Belnap 1982).\n\n\n\n\nDifferent versions of the inferential characterization approach make\ndifferent decisions about these matters, and these differences affect\nwhich constants get certified as \u201clogical.\u201d For example, if we use\nsingle-conclusion sequents with the standard rules for the constants,\nwe get the intuitionistic connectives, while if we use\nmultiple-conclusion sequents, we get the classical connectives (Kneale\n1956, 253). If we adopt Do\u0161en\u2019s constraints on acceptable rules\n(Do\u0161en 1994, 280), the S4 necessity operator gets counted as a\nlogical constant, while if we adopt Hacking\u2019s constraints, it doesn\u2019t\n(Hacking 1979, 297). Thus, if we are to have any hope of deciding the\nhard cases in a principled way, we will have to motivate all of the\ndecisions that distinguish our version of the inferential\ncharacterization approach from the others. Here, however, we will avoid\ngetting into these issues of detail and focus instead on the basic\nidea.\n\n\nThe basic idea is that the logical constants are distinguished from\nother sorts of expressions by being \u201ccharacterizable\u201d in terms of\npurely inferential rules. But what does \u201ccharacterizable\u201d mean here? As\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente (2002, 29) observes, it might be taken to require\neither the fixation of reference (semantic value) or the fixation of\nsense:\n\n\nSemantic value determination: A constant \\(c\\) is\ncharacterizable by rules \\(R\\) iff its being governed by\n\\(R\\) suffices to fix its reference or semantic value (for\nexample, the truth function it expresses), given certain semantic\nbackground assumptions (Hacking 1979, 299, 313).\n\nSense determination: A constant \\(c\\) is\ncharacterizable by rules \\(R\\) iff its being governed by \\(R\\) suffices\nto fix its sense: that is, one can grasp the sense of \\(c\\) simply by\nlearning that it is governed by \\(R\\) (Popper 1946\u20137, 1947; Kneale\n1956, 254\u20135; Peacocke 1987; Hodes 2004, 135).\n\n\n\nLet us consider these two versions of the inferential\ncharacterization approach in turn.\n",
