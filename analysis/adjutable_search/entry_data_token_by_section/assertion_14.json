    "main_text": "Normative Accounts, Hearer-Directed\n6.1 Commitment\n\nMaking an assertion has normative consequences. To characterize the\nsocial dimension of assertion, some authors focus on the distinctive\nresponsibilities\n (\u201ccommitments\u201d[32])\n that a communicator takes on when they claim that something is the\ncase. We shall begin by reviewing two main ways to understand what\nassertoric commitment is.\n\nA first view, that we may call \u201ccommitment as\naccountability\u201d, focuses on the sanctions that speakers\naccept to face if what they claimed turns out to be false. This\ncharacterization of assertion was first developed by Peirce:\n\n\nan act of assertion [\u2026] renders [the speaker] liable to the\npenalties of the social law (or, at any rate, those of the moral law)\nin case [the asserted proposition] should not be true, unless he has a\ndefinite and sufficient excuse. ([CP]: 2.315)\n\n\nWilliam P. Alston (2000: 55) presents the idea as follows: a speaker\naccepts responsibility for a content p being true iff the\nspeaker\n\n\nknowingly [takes] on the liability to ([lay] herself open to) blame\n(censure, reproach, being taken to task, being called to account), in\ncase of\n not-p.[33]\n\n\nThe notion of liability at play here is normative: when you\nassert that p, your audience acquires a (defeasible) right to\ncriticize you if what you say is false. On this view, to assert is\nakin to signing a contract by means of which you take responsibility\nfor something (what you said) being true, and accept to pay the\nconsequences\n otherwise.[34]\n\nTo emphasize this, some authors write that assertions\nguarantee (Peirce [CP]: 5.543; Watson 2004: 66),\nassure (Moran 2005, Hinchman 2013) or warrant\n(Carson 2006) that their content is true. However, it is not obvious\nthat what assertions guarantee is that their content is true.\nIt may be that an assertor instead accepts the responsibility for\nbeing justified in believing that one knows that the\nproposition is true (Green 2009), or that they know that the\nproposition is true.\n\nAn alternative way to characterize the responsibilities generated by\nassertions is to focus on what the speaker is expected to do,\nin virtue of making an assertion. Assertoric responsibility can be\nunderstood as a commitment to act in a certain way. When you\nmake an assertion, you generate an expectation that you will behave in\ncertain ways and not in others, especially in relation to what you\nwill say\n next.[35]\n To take a simple example, once you assert that p, it becomes\ninappropriate for you to make statements that blatantly contradict\np (Hamblin 1970b), or to behave in ways that are sharply at\nodds with accepting p as true (Geurts\n 2019).[36]\n\nFurthermore, making an assertion commits you to respond to\npeople\u2019s questions and challenges in certain ways, as the\nconversation evolves. Brandom (1994: 173\u2013175) emphasizes this,\nand argues that asserting achieves two different social results at the\nsame time: (i) it commits the speaker to defend her claim in response\nto legitimate challenges; and relatedly (ii)\nauthorizes the hearer to claim anything that follows from\nwhat the speaker asserted. MacFarlane (2003: 14\n [Other Internet References])\n summarizes (and revises) the underlying idea as follows:\n\n\nTo assert a sentence S (at a context U) is\n(inter alia) to commit oneself to providing adequate grounds\nfor the truth of S (relative to U), in response to\nany appropriate challenge, or (when appropriate) to defer this\nresponsibility to another asserter on whose testimony one is relying.\nOne can escape this commitment only by withdrawing the assertion.\n\n\nSeveral technical notions are at play here. One is the notion of\nchallenge. To challenge an assertion is to question its\nveracity (or, at least, the speaker\u2019s entitlement to make the\nassertion). An interlocutor can challenge an assertion by means of\nquestions, such as (Q),  or explicit denials, like (D):\n\n(Q)\nHow do you know that?\n(D)\nThat\u2019s not true!\n\n\nChallenges like (Q) and (D) \n are usually appropriate, but not always. For instance, they may be\ninappropriate if in the conversaation it is already settled that what\nthe speaker said is\n true.[37]\n Asserting only commits you to respond to appropriate\nchallenges \u2013 or else retract your assertion (on norms of\nretraction, see\n section 5.1.4.)\n\nIt is often argued that there is a whole family of speech acts\n(\u201cassertives\u201d or \u201crepresentatives\u201d) that\n\u201ccommit the speaker (to varying degrees) to something\u2019s\nbeing the case\u201d (Searle 1979: 12): illocutionary acts such as\nwarning, denying, reminding, arguing, deducing, and so forth.\nThese speech acts differ in the strength of the commitments they\ngenerate (e.g., swearing that p involves a stronger\ncommitment than plain assertion), and in the conditions required for\ntheir felicitous performance (e.g., warning about p is only\nappropriate if p involves a risk or danger for the\ninterlocutor). If a speech act involves a stronger commitment than\nassertion and/or extra felicity conditions, we can say that it is\n\u201cstronger\u201d than assertion. Searle and Vanderveken (1985)\nnote that whenever you perform the stronger speech act, you have also\nmade an assertion. For example, it would not be incorrect to report\n (34)\n or\n (35)\n by saying that the speaker has claimed, asserted,\nor affirmed that she is a certified forklift operator:\n\n(34)\nI swear that I am a certified forklift operator.\n(35)\nI warn you that I am a certified forklift operator.\n\n\nIf this is right, the term \u201cassertion\u201d does not designate\na single illocutionary act, but rather a class of them: it denotes\nevery speech act that is normatively stronger than (or equal to)\nassertion. This seems to lose track of a narrower meaning of the term\n\u201cassertion\u201d, one that sets plain assertions apart from\nstronger assertives. A strategy to rescue this narrow meaning while\nacknowledging assertion\u2019s close ties with other assertives is\nfound in Green (2013, 2017, 2020b: 8). Green, (like Brandom)\nunderstands commitment as a responsibility to defend your claim, and\nargues that an assertion commits you to a greater justificatory burden\nthan weaker assertives, and lesser than stronger assertives (for an\nalternative, like-minded solution, Marsili 2015: 123\u2013127).\nLabinaz (2018) outlines some difficulties for extending the Brandomian\nframework to assertive speech acts, and proposes to adopt an\nalternative approach to degrees of commitment that rather owes to the\nwork of Austin (cf. also Labinaz & Sbis\u00e0 2014:\n\u00a73).\n\nWe have seen that assertions differ from other speech acts in terms of\nthe commitments that they engender. It has also been noted that\nassertions themselves can differ in terms of the commitments that they\ngenerate: not all assertions generate commitment of the same\nstrength.\n\nUsing expressions like \u201cI think that A is\nB\u201d, \u201cProbably/Perhaps A is\nB\u201d, or \u201cA is quite B\u201d, a\nspeaker can mitigate their assertion that A is\nB. And using intensifiers like \u201cI know that A\nis B\u201d, \u201cSurely A is B\u201d,\nor \u201cA is absolutely B\u201d, the speaker can\nstrengthen or boost their assertion that A\nis B. These expressions modulate the degree of the\ncommitment engendered by the assertions in which they occur: they can\nbe used to undertake more or less responsibility\ntowards the content of the assertion, and more generally to modulate\nthe force and of the resulting speech\n act.[38]\n\nThe commitments generated by assertions have often been compared to\nthose generated by promises. For instance, by saying\n (36)\n to a friend, a speaker will typically commit herself to calling the\nrepair shop at 8.\n\n(36)\nI promise to call the repair at 8.\n\n\nIn a standard context, as a result of uttering\n (36),\n both the speaker and the addressee will regard the speaker as having\nincurred an obligation to the addressee.\n\nIn the literature, the standard view is that assertions and promises\ngenerate commitments of different kinds, so that they belong to\ndifferent families (e.g., Searle 1969, 1979). The relation between\nasserting and promising is discussed in detail in Watson (2004), who\nintroduces a distinction between primary and\nsecondary commitments. Assertions and promises differ in the\nprimary commitments that they generate. When you promise to\n\u03c6, your primary commitment is to (intend to)\nact so as to make \u03c6 happen. By contrast,\nwhen you assert that p, your primary commitment is to facts\nthat are independent of your actions: namely, for Watson, the\ndefensibility of p (Watson 2004: 68). Furthermore,\nboth assertions and promises also involve a secondary commitment to\nact in certain ways \u201cif one is queried or if things go\nwrong\u201d (2004: 67). The speaker\u2019s commitment to defend the\nassertion if challenged is on this view a secondary commitment, that\nfollows from the primary one (2004: 70).\n\nSome authors maintain a stronger connection between promising and\nasserting. Marsili (2016) argues that promising that you will\n\u03c6 \u201cillocutionary entails\u201d\nasserting that you will \u03c6. The idea is that\npromises behave like the \u201cstrong assertives\u201d discussed\nabove (swearing, confessing, guaranteeing, etc.), whose performance\ncommits the speaker to having made an assertion. For instance, if Pepa\nutters\n (36),\n it would be appropriate to say that Pepa has asserted,\naffirmed or claimed that she will call the repair shop.\nAnd if Pepa does not believe that she will call the repair shop, it\nwould be appropriate to say that Pepa has lied. In this sense,\npromising that you will do something entails asserting that you will\ndo\n it.[39]\n\nHawley (2019) also draws a strong connection between asserting and\npromises, but in the opposite direction: she analyses assertion in\nterms of promising (cf. also Carson 2006). Hawley suggests that\nwhenever you make an assertion about p, you also promise to\nspeak truthfully as to whether p. This means that whenever\nyou assert, your promise to speak truthfully is simultaneously made\nand either fulfilled or broken (depending on whether you are speaking\ntruthfully or not). However, this view has trouble explaining an\nimportant difference between asserting and promising: assertions can\nbe mitigated (\u201cMaybe I will do it\u201d is perfectly fine) but\npromises cannot (\u201cI promise that maybe I will do it\u201d is\nnot a genuine promise).\n\nCommitment-making is central to some \u201cmixed\u201d accounts of\nassertion\u2014that is, accounts that incorporate insights from\ndifferent theories of assertion. For Peirce, commitment is central to\nassertion, but not alone in characterizing it. In his view, asserting\nalso involves belief-expression: it \u201cconsists in the furnishing\nof evidence by the speaker to the hearer that the speaker believes\nsomething\u201d (Peirce [CP]: 2.335). Furthermore, for Peirce\nassertion is necessarily accompanied by an intention to convince the\nhearer: \u201cevery assertion involves an effort to make the intended\ninterpreter believe what is asserted\u201d (Peirce [CP]: 5.547). In\nshort, Peirce\u2019s view is that in asserting that p, you\nattempt to convince your audience that p is true by providing\nthem with evidence that you believe that p, thereby becoming\ncommitted to (i.e., accountable for) the truth of\n p.[40]\n\nAnother mixed account is defended by Searle (1969) (cf. also Searle\n1975b: 322 and Searle & Vanderveken 1985). Searle\u2019s\ncharacterization of assertion varies slightly throughout his writings,\nbut the central idea is that assertion can be identified on the basis\nof its distinctive rules\u2014the rules for uttering an assertion\n\u201csuccessfully\u201d and \u201cnon-defectively\u201d (i.e.,\nfelicitously). They are presented as rules for the use of\nforce-indicating devices (Searle 1969: 62\u20134). The rules can be\nsummarized as follows. Here S is the speaker and H\nthe hearer:\n\n(Searle)\n\n\n1.\nThe propositional content rule: what is to be expressed is any\nproposition p\n2.\nFirst preparatory rule: S has evidence (reasons etc.) for\nthe truth of p.\n3.\nSecond preparatory rule: It is not obvious to both S and\nH that H knows (does not need to be reminded of,\netc.) p.\n4.\nSincerity rule: S believes p.\n5.\nConstitutive rule: Counts as an undertaking to the effect that\np represents an actual state of affairs.\n \n\n\nThe fifth rule is the crucial one, and is held to be\nconstitutive of assertion. Searle contrasts constitutive\nrules with regulative\n rules.[41]\n Constitutive rules, according to Searle, are like definitions: they\ndefine what it is to engage in a certain activity: for instance,\n\u201cattacking the king in such a way that no move will leave it\nunattacked counts as checkmate\u201d (Searle 1969: 33).\n\nSearle seems to adopt a notion of \u201ccommitment\u201d that\ninvolves both a responsibility to respond to challenges (\u00e0 la\nBrandom) and a liability to sanctions (\u00e0 la Peirce): the\nassertor is expected to \u201cbe able to provide reasons for the\noriginal statement [\u2026] and can be held publicly responsible if\nit turns out to be false\u201d (Searle 2010: 82). Like Peirce, also\nSearle (1969: 65) integrates commitment with belief-expression: the\nspeaker expresses the state required by the sincerity rule, i.e., in\nthe case of assertion, whose sincerity rule is (4), the speaker\nexpresses a belief. Finally, the speaker implies that the preparatory\nconditions are met\u2014so that Searle\u2019s view has the odd\nconsequence that in asserting p, you imply that p is\nnot obviously true.\n\nA third \u201cmixed\u201d account is defended by Green (1999, 2000,\n2007, 2013, 2017, 2020a). Green distinguishes three different\nnormative notions in terms of which assertions (and other assertive\nspeech acts) can be characterized:\n\nFidelity\nLiability\nFrankness\n\n\nThe first component, fidelity, tracks commitment: one\u2019s\nresponsibility to respond to legitimate challenges. More specifically,\nfor Green, being assertorically committed to p means\nbeing responsible to provide \u201cstrong justification if\nchallenged\u201d (2017). Here \u201cstrong\u201d is used in\ncontrast to weaker assertives, like conjectures, for performing which\nis sufficient to be able to provide some (non-conclusive)\njustification if challenged.\n\nThe second component is liability to error:\n\n\none who asserts that P is liable to be right or wrong on the\nissue of P\u2019s truth exactly as P turns out to\nbe true or false. (2020a: 350)\n\n\nThis is a feature that assertion has in common with weaker assertives:\nalso in guessing or hypothesizing that p, you may be right or\nwrong depending on whether p is actually true. This relates\nto Dummett\u2019s idea that \u201can assertion is a kind of gamble\nthat the speaker will not be proved wrong\u201d (1976: 84).\n\nThe third component, frankness, has to do with sincerity:\n\u201cassertion is sincere just in case the speaker believes the\ncontent she has asserted\u201d (Green 2020a: 350). This requirement\nsets assertion aside from other assertives (such as educated guesses\nand conjectures) that do not require belief for sincere performance\n(but rather, e.g., some reasons to think the content true).\n\nA full account of assertion has to provide necessary and\nsufficient conditions for asserting. But is commitment to\nwhat you say sufficient for asserting? That is, if you say that\np and thereby also commit to the truth of p, does it\nfollow that you have asserted that p? Pagin (2004) offers a\nnegative response. The reason is that one can construct an utterance\ntype that isn\u2019t assertoric, but that would be assertoric\naccording to envisaged sufficiency view. A simple example is given\nby\n\n(37)\nI hereby commit myself to the truth of the proposition that there\nare black swans.\n\n\nWhoever utters\n (37)\n felicitously incurs a commitment to the truth of the proposition that\nthere are black swans. However, intuitively\n (37)\n would not be an assertion that there are black swans; at most, it is\na declaration of the speaker\u2019s intent to be committed to that\nproposition. What is said here does not entail that there are black\nswans (it may be accurate even if there are no black swans). If this\nis right, then incurring a commitment is not sufficient for asserting.\nThis objection puts pressure on any \u201chearer-directed\u201d\naccount, including all the ones discussed in section 4, because\nparallel constructions can be derived from any hearer-directed view;\nfor instance (against belief-expression views) by letting the speaker\ndeclare that she is representing herself as believing a given\nproposition.\n\nSome authors have questioned whether this test really undermines\ncommitment accounts of assertion (and social accounts more\ngenerally). Pegan (2009) argues that the counterexamples can be\nblocked by carefully amending the theory; see Pagin (2009) for a\nresponse. MacFarlane (2011) and Garc\u00eda-Carpintero (2013)\nsuggest that if we distinguish between what is said\nand what is asserted, we can\nregard (37) as an assertion that all swans are\nblack. Marsili & Green (2021) argue that this sort of test is\nunreliable, questioning some key assumptions needed for\n(37) to work as a\ncounterexample. They acknowledge, nonetheless, that assertions are not\nfully reducible to their social effects.\n",
