In other words, they have offered\ndetailed accounts of how\n step (3)\u2014introduced\n in the previous section\u2014can be taken in the context of\nmathematics in general and geometry in particular. A central question\nin this context was if and how (and to what extent) what is going on\nin the mind of a mathematician when she discovers (or invents) a\nmathematical truth corresponds to what she presents as the proof of\nthis discovery (or invention) on paper. In particular, it was\nimportant for Muslim thinkers to know whether or not the order of the\nsteps a mathematician takes to discover a mathematical truth is\nidentical to the order of different stages of the justifications she\nprovides for that truth.\n\nOne of the earliest attempts in this context is Th\u0101bit Ibn\nQurra\u2019s theory of the psychology of mathematical invention.\nHowever, it was probably his grandson, Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Ibn\nSin\u0101n (d. 946), who established an independent area of studies\npertinent to the aforementioned questions in his On the Method of\nAnalysis and Synthesis in the Problems of Geometry (R. Rashed\n& Bellosta 2000: chap. I). He categorizes geometrical problems\ninto different groups based on different criteria and, providing\nconcrete examples, explains how each group of problems must be\nanalyzed (ta\u1e25l\u012bl) and how a solution for them can\nbe synthesized (tark\u012bb). He highlights the possible\nerrors and mistakes that one might make in the process of analysis and\nsynthesis and elaborates how they can be avoided. The next important\nfigure in this area is al-Sijz\u012b (d. ~1020), who wrote a book\n(Geometrical Treatise on Problem Solving) on different\nmethods which can facilitate the procedure of problem solving in\ngeometry. But the most mature work among these kinds of studies is\nperhaps Ibn al-Haytham\u2019s F\u012b al-ta\u1e25l\u012bl wa\nal-tark\u012bb (On Analysis and Synthesis; R. Rashed\n2006 [2017: 219\u2013304]). An interesting issue discussed in this\narea of philosophy of mathematics was the nature of undecidable\nproblems; claims for whose truth or falsity we have no proof. This\nissue was discussed in particular by al-Samaw\u02beal (d. 1180) in the\ncontext of the classification of geometrical problems in his\nal-B\u0101hir f\u012b al-jabr. His classification project can\nbe understood as a succession to that of Ibn Sin\u0101n (R. Rashed\n1984b [1994: 41\u201343]; 2008: sec. 3; 2015: 726\u201332).\n",
