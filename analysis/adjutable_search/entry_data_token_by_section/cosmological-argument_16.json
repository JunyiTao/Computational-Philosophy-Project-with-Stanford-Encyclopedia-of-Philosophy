    "main_text": "The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument || The Big Bang Is Not an Event\n7.5 The Big Bang Is Not an Event\n\nOne critical response to the kal\u0101m argument from the Big Bang is\nthat, given the Grand Theory of Relativity, the Big Bang is not an\nevent at all. An event takes place within a space-time context.\nHowever, the Big Bang has no space-time context; there is neither time\nprior to the Big Bang nor a space in which the Big Bang occurs. Hence,\nthe Big Bang cannot be considered as a physical event occurring at a\nmoment of time. As Hawking notes, the finite universe has no\nspace-time boundaries and hence lacks singularity and a beginning\n(Hawking 1988: 116, 136). Time might be multi-dimensional or\nimaginary, in which case one asymptotically approaches a beginning\nsingularity but never reaches it. And without a beginning the universe\nrequires no cause. The best one can say is that the universe is finite\nwith respect to the past, not that it was an event with a beginning.\n(Rundle 2004: chap. 8.)\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum defends this position by arguing that events can only\nresult from other events. \n\n\nSince the Big Bang singularity is technically a non-event, and \\(t=0\\)\nis not a bona fide time of its occurrence, the singularity cannot be\nthe effect of any cause in the case of either event-causation or agent\ncausation alike\u2026. The singularity \\(t=0\\) cannot have a cause.\n(Gr\u00fcnbaum 1994; Rundle 2004: 168, writes, \u201c[T]here is no\nevent\u2014the beginning of the universe\u2014to be explained,\nevents being possible only in time\u201d)\n\n\nOne response to Gr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s objection is to opt for broader\nnotions of \u201cevent\u201d and \u201ccause\u201d. We might\nbroaden the notion of \u201cevent\u201d by removing the requirement\nthat it must be relational, taking place in a space-time context. In\nthe Big Bang the space-time universe commences and then continues to\nexist in measurable time subsequent to the initiating singularity\n(Silk 2001: 456). Thus, one might consider the Big Bang as either the\nevent of the commencing of the universe or else a state in which\n\u201cany two points in the observable universe were arbitrarily\nclose together\u201d (Silk 2001: 63). As such, one might inquire why\nthis initial state of the universe existed in the finite past.\nLikewise, one need not require that causation embody the Humean\ncondition of temporal priority, but may treat causation\ncounter-factually, or perhaps even, as traditionally, a relation of\nproduction. Any causal statement about the universe would have to be\nexpressed atemporally, but for the theist this presents no problem\nprovided that God is conceived atemporally (at least prior to\ncreation) and sense can be made of atemporal causation.\n\nFurthermore, suppose Gr\u00fcnbaum is correct that the Big Bang\nsingularity is not an event. Then, by his reasoning that events only\narise from other events, subsequent so-called events cannot be the\neffect of that singularity. If they were, they would not be events\neither. \n\nGiven this understanding of space/time, we might reconceive the\nkal\u0101m argument.\n\nIf something has a finite past, its existence has a\ncause.\nThe universe has a finite past.\nTherefore, the universe has a cause of its\nexistence.\nThe universe includes space-time.\nTherefore, the cause of the universe transcends\nspace-time (in the sense that it existed aspatially and, when there\nwas no universe, atemporally). \nIf the cause of the universe\u2019s existence\ntranscends space-time, no scientific explanation can provide a causal\naccount of the origin of the universe.\nIf no scientific explanation can provide a causal\naccount of the origin of the universe, the cause must be personal\n(explanation is given in terms of a personal agent).\nTherefore, a personal cause of the universe exists.\n\n\n\nSome critics see a problem with this reformulation of the\nkal\u0101m argument in\n premise 12.\n Whereas behind\n premise 1\n of the original argument lies the ancient Parmenidean contention that\nout of nothing nothing comes, it is alleged that no principle directly\nconnects finitude with causation. They contend that we have no reason\nto think that just because something is finite it must have a cause of\nits coming into existence. Theists respond that this objection has\nmerit only if the critic denies that the Principle of Causation is\ntrue or that it applies to events like the Big Bang.\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum (1991) also argues that defenders of the\nkal\u0101m argument cannot make sense of the claim that the\nuniverse began to exist. \n\n\nThe question of its beginning is not, \u201cIf the universe did have\na bounded past of finite duration, what was the cause of its initial\nevent \\(t=0\\)?\u201d There simply did not exist any instants of\ntime before \\(t=0\\)! \n\n\nOne simply cannot ask what happened before \\(t=0\\); the question makes\nno sense. And if we cannot ask that question, then we cannot inquire\nwhether the Big Bang was an effect, for nothing temporal preceded it.\nQuestions about creation occur in time in the universe, not outside of\nit (Hawking 1987: 650\u201351).\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum\u2019s contention is that to begin to exist requires a\nprevious time, and that there was no time prior to the Big Bang.\n\n\n[T]here is no first instant of time at all, just as there is\nno leftmost point on an infinite Euclidean line that extends in both\ndirections. Since here as elsewhere, the term \u2018always\u2019\nrefers to all actual past instants of time, the non-existence of time\nbefore \\(t=0\\) \u2026 allows that matter has always\nexisted, despite the finitude of the age of the universe in both sets\nof models. (1991)\n\n\nHowever, as Craig observes, the series is finite, not infinite, even\nthough it includes all past instants of time. Beginning to exist does\nnot entail that one has a beginning point in time. Craig\ndefines \u201c\\(x\\) begins to exist\u201d as \u201c\\(x\\) exists at\n\\(t\\) and there is no time immediately prior to \\(t\\) at which \\(x\\)\nexists\u201d (1992: 238). \n\n\nSomething has a beginning just in case the time during which it has\nexisted is finite.\u2026 So understood, deleting the beginning point\nof a thing\u2019s existence does not imply that the thing no longer\nbegins to exist and therefore came into being uncaused. (Craig and\nSinclair 2009: 185)\n\n\nMorriston (2000) suggests that this analysis of the universe\u2019s\ncoming to be no longer adequately supports\n premise 1,\n for we have no reason to think that something could not just come\ninto existence. Any appeal to ex nihilo nihil fit is either\ntautologous with the first premise or else appears mistakenly to treat\nnihilo as if it were \u201ca condition of something\u201d.\nIn part, what Morriston rejects is the intuitiveness that Craig sees\nin the truth of\n premise 1,\n where \u201cbeginning to exist\u201d is understood as explicated as\nabove (see our discussion in\n 7.1).\n It is not that premise 1 is false; it is just that it is unsupported\nand hence loses its plausibility. It has the same plausibility (or\nimplausibility) as creation ex nihilo. Morriston thinks that\n premise 1\n fares equally poorly if Craig attempts to justify it empirically, for\nwe have many situations where the causes of events have not been\ndiscovered, and even if we could find the causes in each individual\ncase, it provides no evidence that causation applies to the totality\nof cases (the universe). (See our discussion of this argument in\n 4.2\n and\n 4.3\n above.) Indeed, he argues, the inductive generalization involved in\ndefending the causal principle stands at odds with similar inductive\ngeneralizations that conflict with the kal\u0101m\nargument\u2014that something can be made without there being a prior\nstuff or that causes can bear no temporal relation to their effects.\n\n",
