And in what domains or parts of our life do the\nrequirements of public reason apply?\n\nRawls argues that public reason imposes a moral duty of\ncivility on all citizens to explain to one another how, at least\nwith regard to constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice,\nthe political positions \u201cthey advocate and vote for can be\nsupported by the political values of public reason\u201d (Rawls 1996,\n217). Citizens, Rawls suggests, should think of themselves as if they\nwere legislators, supporting only those political positions that they\nbelieve could be justified by appeal to reasons that all reasonable\npersons could endorse, and holding government officials to this\nstandard (Rawls 1999b, 576\u2013577). But Rawls appears to believe\nthat public reason imposes greater duties on public officials: elected\nofficials and those who run for office, their staff, and judges. This\nis because, in these roles, these people work at what Rawls considers\nthe main site of public reason, namely, the public\npolitical forum. This forum has three parts: (1) the discourse of\njudges, (2) the discourse of government officials, and (3) the\ndiscourse of candidates for public office and their campaign managers\n(Rawls 1999b, 575). The public political forum is the arena where our\nfundamental political principles and institutions are shaped and\ndebated\u2014it is where collective political power is most directly\nexercised\u2014and thus it is the most appropriate site for the\napplication of individual duties of public reason. When engaged in\ndiscourse in this arena, officials are to refrain from appealing to\nreligious or other comprehensive doctrines over which reasonable\npersons are assumed to disagree, and instead make arguments that\nappeal to our shared political values. Rawls does, however, qualify\nthis duty by appeal to what he refers to as the \u201cwide\nview\u201d of public political culture, which permits officials and\ncitizens to introduce their religious or otherwise comprehensive views\ninto political discussion at any point, provided appropriate public\nreasons are provided in due course (Rawls 1999b, 591). It is also\nimportant to note that the duty of civility is, on Rawls\u2019s view,\na moral but not a legal duty\u2014it cannot be coercively\nimposed\u2014and it does not apply to the discussions citizens may\nhave outside the public political forum, for example, the discussions\nindividuals have qua members of private associations, or family\nmembers, or discussions within universities, religious institutions,\nor other parts of what Rawls calls the background culture (Rawls 1996,\n220).\n\nRawls\u2019s account of the duty of civility and the site of public\nreason has been subject to a number of criticisms, some of which will\nbe discussed in section 7 below. But even setting these objections\naside, not all proponents of public reason believe that it ought to\ndirectly regulate the behavior of individual citizens in the manner\nsuggested by Rawls. Some argue that the aims of public reason are best\nserved by permitting ordinary citizens, and perhaps even elected\nofficials, to debate and deliberate unconstrained by the duty of\ncivility (e.g. Benhabib 2002, 108\u2013112; Bohman 2003; Gaus 2009;\nGaus and Vallier 2009; Vallier 2014; Vallier 2016). Some argue for\nthis less restrictive view because they hold different conceptions of\nthe constituency and content of public reason; the more\nphilosophically indeterminate those conceptions are, the less\nplausible it is to impose a restrictive duty of civility on individual\ncitizens, since only by allowing citizens to engage in a fairly\nunconstrained discourse can the content of public reason emerge\n(Benhabib 2002; Bohman 2003). Others reject the duty of civility\nbecause they endorse a different account of the structure of public\nreason. If, for example, the convergence view of public reason\u2019s\nstructure is correct, then citizens and officials need not refrain\nfrom appealing to religious or otherwise comprehensive arguments in\npolitical deliberations, since those reasons might succeed in\njustifying a proposed law to some members of the public, even if\nothers cannot reasonably accept those reasons. Those who endorse\nconsensus conceptions of public reason\u2019s structure, however, are\nlikely to protest that abandoning the duty of civility in this way is\nto effectively abandon the idea of public reason, since there would no\nlonger be any requirement that public policies be justified by appeal\nto shared or common reasons.\n\nDifferent accounts of public reason thus yield sharply different views\nregarding the duties of citizens and public officials. On\nRawls\u2019s view, and other similar views, citizens and public\nofficials should generally refrain from relying on ideas or reasons\nthat other reasonable citizens reject, and must always show how the\npolitical positions they support can be justified by appeal to shared\npolitical values. On other accounts, the idea public reason may\nregulate the way we design our democratic institutions, and may be a\nstandard by which particular principles and laws can be assessed, but\nit imposes few, if any, moral restrictions on the behavior of citizens\nand perhaps even elected officials.\n",
