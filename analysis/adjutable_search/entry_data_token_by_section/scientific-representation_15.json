    "main_text": "Representation-As || From Art to Science\n7.1 From Art to Science\n\nMany instances of epistemic representation are instances of what\nGoodman and Elgin call \u201crepresentation-as\u201d. Caricatures\nare paradigmatic examples: Churchill is represented as a bulldog and\nThatcher is represented as a boxer. But the notion is more general:\nHolbein\u2019s Portrait of Henry VIII represents Henry as\nimposing and powerful and Stoddart\u2019s statue of David Hume\nrepresents him as thoughtful and wise. Using these representations we\ncan learn about their targets, for example we can learn about a\npolitician\u2019s or philosopher\u2019s personality. The leading\nidea of the views discussed in this section is that scientific\nrepresentation works in much the same way. A model of the solar system\nrepresents it as consisting of perfect spheres; the logistic model of\ngrowth represents the population as reproducing at fixed intervals of\ntime; and so on. In each instance, models can be used to attempt to\nlearn about their targets by determining what the former represent the\nlatter as being.\n\nThe locution of representation-as functions in the following way: an\nobject \\(X\\) (e.g., a picture, statue, or model) represents a subject\n\\(Y\\) (e.g., a person or target system) as being thus or so \\((Z)\\).\nThe question then is what establishes this sort of representational\nrelationship. The answer requires introducing some of the concepts\nGoodman and Elgin use to develop their account of\nrepresentation-as.\n\nGoodman and Elgin draw a distinction between something being a\nrepresentation of a \\(Z\\), and something being a \\(Z\\)-representation\n(Elgin 2010: 1\u20132; Goodman 1976: 21\u201326). A painting of a\nunicorn is a unicorn-representation because it shows a unicorn, but it\nis not a representation of a unicorn because there are no unicorns.\nBeing a \\(Z\\)-representation is a one-place predicate that categorises\nrepresentations according to their subject matter. Being a\nrepresentation of something is established by denotation; it\nis a binary relation that holds between a symbol and the object which\nit denotes. The two can, but need not, coincide. Some\ndog-representations are representations of dogs, but not all are\n(e.g., a caricature of Churchill), and not all representations of dogs\nare dog-representations (e.g., a lightening bolt may represent the\nfastest greyhound at the races).\n\nThe next notion is exemplification: an object \\(X\\)\nexemplifies a property \\(P\\) iff \\(X\\) instantiates \\(P\\) and thereby\nrefers back to \\(P\\) (Goodman 1976: 53). In the current context\nproperties are to be understood in the widest possible sense. An item\ncan exemplify one-place properties, multi-place properties (i.e.,\nrelations), higher order properties, structural properties, etc.\nParadigmatic examples of this are samples. A chip of paint on a\nmanufacturer\u2019s sample card instantiates a certain colour and at\nthe same time refers to that colour (Elgin 1983: 71). Notice that\ninstantiation is necessary but insufficient for exemplification: the\nsample card does not exemplify being rectangular for example. When a\nobject exemplifies a property it provides us with epistemic access to\nthat property.\n\nRepresentation-as is then established by combining these notions\ntogether: a \\(Z\\)-representation exemplifies properties associated\nwith\n \\(Z\\)s,[11]\n and if the \\(Z\\)-representation additionally denotes \\(Y\\), then\nthese properties can be imputed onto \\(Y\\) (cf. Elgin 2010: 10). This\nprovides the following account of epistemic representation:\n\nRepresentation-As: \\(X\\) is an epistemic representation of\n\\(Y\\) iff (i) \\(X\\) denotes \\(Y\\), (ii) \\(X\\) is a\n\\(Z\\)-representation exemplifying properties \\(P_1, \\ldots , P_n\\),\nand (iii) \\(X\\) imputes \\(P_1, \\ldots , P_n\\), or related properties,\nonto \\(Y\\).\n\nApplying this in the scientific context, i.e., by letting \\(X\\) range\nover models and \\(Y\\) over target systems, we arrive at an answer to\nthe ER-problem. Representation-As also answers the other\nproblems introduced in\n Section 1:\n it repudiates the demarcation problem and it explains the\ndirectionality of representation. It accounts for surrogative\nreasoning in terms of the properties imputed to the target. If \\(Y\\)\npossesses the imputed properties then the representation is accurate,\nbut since the target doesn\u2019t necessarily need to instantiate\nthem it allows for the possibility of misrepresentation. Different\nstyles can be accounted for by categorising representations in terms\nof different \\(Z\\)s, or in terms of the properties they exemplify.\nHowever, at least as stated, the account remains silent on the problem\nof ontology and the applicability of mathematics. We discuss below how\nto account for targetless models.\n",
