    "main_text": "Testimony and Evidence || Hybrid Views\n3.3 Hybrid Views\n\nWe have seen that the evidential and non-evidential views discussed\nabove offer very different takes on how our testimonial-based beliefs\nare justified. We have also seen that while these views have their\nadvantages, they face some serious problems as well. Consequently,\nsome epistemologists have argued that testimonial justification cannot\nbe explained in a unified way. Instead, the strategy has been to offer\nhybrid views that combine various components of the accounts discussed\nabove.\n\nFor instance, some have tried to combine Reductionist and Reliabilist\ninsights such that testimonial justification consists partly in the\nhearer\u2019s evidence for accepting the speaker\u2019s testimony,\nand partly in terms of the speaker\u2019s and hearer\u2019s\nreliability at producing and consuming testimony respectively, e.g.,\nLackey (2008). Others have tried to combine insights from\nReductionism, Reliabilism and the Inheritance View such that a\nhearer\u2019s belief can be justified by their own evidence for\naccepting what the speaker says, or by the reliability of the\nspeaker\u2019s testimony, or by inheriting the evidence that is\npossessed by the speaker, e.g., Wright (2019). (For other hybrid\nviews, see Gerken 2013 and Faulkner 2000).\n\nMuch of the recent work on testimonial justification concerns whether\nthese hybrid views ultimately succeed, or whether they run into\nproblems of their own.\n",
