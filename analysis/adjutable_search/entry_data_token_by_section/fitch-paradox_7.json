    "main_text": "Logical Revisions || Paraconsistent Revision\n3.5 Paraconsistent Revision\n\nAnother challenge to the logic of Fitch\u2019s paradox is mentioned in\nRoutley (1981) and defended by Beall (2000). The thought is that the\ncorrect logic of knowability is paraconsistent. In a paraconsistent\nlogic contradictions do not trivialize a theory, because they do not\n\u2018explode\u2019. That is, in a paraconsistent logic the\ninference from \\(p \\wedge \\neg p\\) to an arbitrary\nconclusion \\(r\\) is not valid. Owing to this consideration some\ncontradictions are permitted and thought to be possible. \n\nBeall contends that (1) Fitch\u2019s proof turns on the assumption that,\nfor all statements \\(p\\), the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is impossible and (2) we have independent evidence\nfor thinking \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for some \\(p\\).\nThe independent evidence lies in the\n paradox of the knower\n (not to be\nmistaken with the paradox of knowability). The relevant version of the\nknower paradox may be demonstrated by considering the following\nself-referential sentence:\n\n\\[\\tag{\\(k\\)}\nk \\text{ is unknown.}\n\\]\n\n\nAssume for the sake of argument that \\(k\\) is known. Then,\npresuming that knowledge entails truth, \\(k\\) is true. But\n\\(k\\) says that \\(k\\) is unknown. So \\(k\\) is unknown.\nConsequently, \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. But then our\nassumption (i.e., that \\(k\\) is known) is false, and provably so.\nAnd, granting that a proven falsehood is known to be false, it follows\nthat it is known that \\(k\\) is unknown. That is to say, it is\nknown that \\(k\\). But we have already shown that if it is known\nthat \\(k\\) then \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. So it is\nproven that \\(k\\) is both known and unknown. It is provably the\ncase that the full description of our knowledge includes both\n\\(K(k)\\) and \\(\\neg K(k)\\). That is the\nknower paradox.\n\nBeall suggests that the knower gives us some independent evidence for\nthinking \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\), for some \\(p\\), that\nthe full description of human knowledge has the interesting feature of\nbeing inconsistent. With a paraconsistent logic, one may accept this\nwithout triviality. And so it is suggested that one go paraconsistent\nand embrace \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) as a true consequence\nof the knowability principle. Beall concludes that Fitch\u2019s reasoning,\nwithout a proper reply to the knower, is ineffective against the\nknowability principle. For Fitch\u2019s reasoning allegedly turns on the\nassumption that, for all \\(p\\), it is impossible that \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\).\n\nNotice that our presentation of Fitch\u2019s reasoning makes no explicit\nmention of the assumption that \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\) is\nimpossible. So here we attempt to pinpoint exactly where Fitch\u2019s\nreasoning goes wrong on the above account. It is claimed at line 9 (in\nthe first section of this entry) that \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible. Of course \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) entails the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). And so, if the reasoning is that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible because\ncontradictions are impossible, then Beall would be directly attacking\nthe argument presented herein. But notice the argument here is subtly\ndifferent. It goes like this. \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) entails the contradiction \\(Kp \\wedge \\neg Kp\\). So, by reductio, \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is false. By necessitation, it follows that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is necessarily false.\nDepending on the paraconsistent logic, the paraconsistist may object\nto use of reductio, or may object to other inferences. The claim that\n\\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is impossible (at line\n9) is inferred from this claim that \\(K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) is necessarily false. This may trouble the\nparaconsistentist. By the lights of one living with contradiction, it\nmay not follow that an inconsistent statement is impossible even if it\nis necessarily false. After all, on this account a necessarilly false\nstatement may be both false and true at some world, in which case the\nstatement is both necessarily false and possible. If this is right\nthen the inference from \\(\\Box \\neg p\\) to \\(\\neg \\Diamond p\\)\nhas counterexamples and may not be employed to infer\n\\(\\neg \\Diamond K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\) from\n\\(\\Box \\neg K(p \\wedge \\neg Kp)\\).\n\nBeall\u2019s insights turn on a number of things: (1) the strength of the\nindependent evidence for true epistemic contradictions, (2) the\nadequacy of the proposed resolutions to the knower paradox, (3) the\nquestion of whether Fitch\u2019s reasoning is ineffective without a\nresolution to the knower and (4) an interpretation for \\(\\Box\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond\\) that invalidates the relevant inference (from\n\\(\\Box \\neg p\\) to \\(\\neg \\Diamond p)\\) while remaining true\nto the role played by \\(\\Diamond\\) in the knowability principle. We leave\nthese problems for further debate. But compare with Wansing (2002),\nwhere a paraconsistent constructive relevant modal logic with strong\nnegation is proposed to block the paradox.\n\nMore recent developments of the paraconsistent approach appear in\nBeall (2009) and Priest (2009).\n",
