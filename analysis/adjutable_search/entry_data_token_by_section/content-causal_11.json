    "main_text": "General Objections to Causal Theories of Mental Content || Causal Theories do not Work for Phenomenal Intentionality\n4.3 Causal Theories do not Work for Phenomenal Intentionality\n\nHorgan and Tienson (2002) object to what they describe as\n\u201cstrong externalist theories\u201d that maintain that causal\nconnections are necessary for content. They argue, first, that mental\nlife involves a lot of intentional content that is constituted by\nphenomenology alone. Perceptual states, such as seeing a red apple,\nare intentional. They are about apples. Believing that there are more\nthan 10 Mersenne primes and hoping to discover a new Mersenne prime\nare also intentional states, in this case about Mersenne primes. But,\nall these intentional states have a phenomenology\u2014something it\nis like to be in these states. There is something it is like to see a\nred apple, something different that it is like to believe there are\nmore than 10 Mersenne primes, and something different still that it is\nlike to hope to discover a new Mersenne prime. Horgan and Tienson\npropose that there can be phenomenological duplicates\u2014two\nindividuals with exactly the same phenomenology. Assume nothing about\nthese duplicates other than that they are phenomenological duplicates.\nIn such a situation, one can be neutral regarding how much of their\nphenomenological experience is veridical and how much illusory. So,\none can be neutral on whether or not a duplicate sees a red apple or\nwhether there really are more than 10 Mersenne primes. This suggests\nthat there is a kind of intentionality\u2014that shared by the\nduplicates\u2014that is purely phenomenological. Second, Horgan and\nTienson argue that phenomenology constitutively depends only on narrow\nfactors. They observe that one\u2019s experiences are often caused or\ntriggered by events in the environment, but that these environmental\ncauses are only parts of causal chains that lead to the phenomenology\nitself. They do not constitute that phenomenology. The states that\nconstitute, or provide the supervenience base for, the phenomenology\nare not the elements of the causal chain leading back into the\nenvironment. If we combine the conclusions of these two arguments, we\nget Horgan and Tienson\u2019s principal argument against any causal\ntheory that would maintain that causal connections are necessary for\ncontent.\n\nP1. There is intentional content that is constituted by phenomenology\nalone.\n\nP2. Phenomenology is constituted only by narrow factors.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nC. There is intentional content that is constituted only by narrow\nfactors.\n\n\nThus, versions of causal theories that suppose that all content must\nbe based on causal connections are fundamentally mistaken. For those\nversions of causal theories that offer only sufficiency conditions on\nsemantic content, however, Horgan and Tienson\u2019s argument may be\ntaken to provide a specific limitation on the scope of causal\ntheories, namely, that causal theories do not work for intentional\ncontent that is constituted by phenomenology alone.\n\nA relatively familiar challenge to this argument may be found in\ncertain representational theories of phenomenological properties.\n(See, for example, Dretske (1988) and Tye (1997).) According to these\nviews, the phenomenology of a mental state derives from that\nstate\u2019s representational properties, but the representational\nproperties are determined by external factors, such as the environment\nin which an organism finds itself. Thus, such representationalist\ntheories challenge premise P2 of Horgan and Tienson\u2019s\nargument.\n",
