    "main_text": "Works || Bessarion the Aristotelian\n2.2 Bessarion the Aristotelian\n\nBessarion\u2019s reputation as a Platonist\u2014mainly associated\nwith his struggle against the arch-Aristotelian George of\nTrebizond\u2014has at times obscured in modern scholarship his\ncontribution to the Peripatetic tradition. By contrast,\nBessarion\u2019s Aristotelian expertise was widely recognized in the\ncenturies after his death, when his translation of the\nMetaphysics was celebrated and reprinted several times,\nincluding in Bekker\u2019s Corpus Aristotelicum (1831).\nUndertaken between 1446 and 1451 and dedicated to King Alfonso I of\nNaples, the translation was praised by Nicholas of Cusa for its\nexcellence, and by Giannozzo Manetti for its clarity, which he\nattributed to the Cardinal\u2019s decision to render the text ad\nsensum, rather than ad verbum.\n\nIn addition to his\nlinguistic skills, Bessarion was aided in this enterprise by a deep\nknowledge of the Aristotelian works, cultivated since his\nBildungsjahre, as a number of studies on the contents of his\nlibrary have revealed. Bessarion was not only receptive to the\nAristotelian tradition, but also to its recent Latin development, as\nrepresented by Scholasticism. Again, studies of Bessarion\u2019s\nlibrary have revealed this only apparently surprising aspect of his\nphilosophical training: Thomas Aquinas in particular was a well-known\nauthor in Byzantium, mostly because of the Greek translations of the\nSumma contra gentiles and of the Summa theologiae\nmade by Demetrios Kydones in the fourteenth century. Bessarion\u2019s\nfamiliarity with these matters also influenced the In\ncalumniatorem Platonis, where one of the Cardinal\u2019s\nrecurring arguments is that George of Trebizond was essentially\nignorant of the traditions (Aristotelianism and Scholasticism) he\nclaimed were superior to Platonism (see below).\n\nBessarion\u2019s reputation as an expert in matters of Aristotelian\nand Scholastic philosophy is exemplified by his role as mediator in a\nquarrel over the future contingents between two theologians from\nLeuven, Henry of Zomeren and Peter de Rivo. From 1469 until his death,\nBessarion played an important role in this controversy not only\nbecause he had once been a patron of de Zomeren himself, but also\nbecause the Cardinal had gathered around him several skilled\nScholastic philosophers, including Francesco della Rovere (soon to be\nPope as Sixtus IV) and Fernando de Cordoba, both of whom took part in\nthe dispute. This was not the only circumstance in which Bessarion and\nmembers of his entourage took part in Scholastic disputes. For all\nthese reasons, the case of Bessarion calls into question the simplistic\nopposition between Aristotelian Scholasticism and a purely Platonic\nHumanism dear to past scholarship, showing instead the blurred lines\nbetween these traditions (see, e.g., Monfasani 2016b). Even the In\ncalumniatorem Platonis, a text consecrated even from its title to\nthe defense of Plato, was no less the result of this ambiguous\nrelationship between Humanism and Scholasticism, between Platonism and\nAristotelianism.\n",
