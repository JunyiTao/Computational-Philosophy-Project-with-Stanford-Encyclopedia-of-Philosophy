    "main_text": "Formulating Dignity || Is a connection to rights a defining property of dignity?\n2.2 Is a connection to rights a defining property of dignity?\n\nIt is beyond the scope of this entry to answer this question in\nanything close to a comprehensive way. (Good starting points include\nMeyer and Parent 1992; Gewirth 1992, Carozza 2008 and 2013;\nand Tasioulas 2013). Instead, let us draw out a few points about the\nconnection between dignity and rights as it bears specifically on\nattempts to make it a defining property of dignity itself. To get at\nthese points, consider a final proposal about the definitional\ncriteria of dignity, from Fitzpatrick (2013):\n\n\nThe primary notion of dignity is the idea of a certain moral\nstatus involving possession of an inherent, unearned form of\nworth or standing\u2014a basic worth or standing that is neither\ndependent on one\u2019s being of use or interest to others nor based\non one\u2019s merits, and which essentially calls for certain forms\nof respect. (2013: 5546)\n\n\nFitzpatrick presents this definition within the context of an\nencyclopedic effort to capture its meaning. As such, he is\nunderstandably aiming at something generic. However, in the light of\nour analysis so far, the tensions in his attempt are manifest, albeit\ninstructive.\n\nFirst, describing dignity as primarily a \u201cstatus\u201d instead\nof a \u201cvalue\u201d aligns with those like Waldron, who make a\nprincipled distinction between their accounts and all kinds of\n\u201cworth\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d conceptions of human\ndignity (see, e.g., Killmister 2020, who emphasizes this distinction;\nand Dan-Cohen 2012, for analysis on its import to Waldron).\nHowever, Fitzpatrick immediately equivocates on this point, redefining\nstatus as, \u201cworth or standing\u201d. Similarly,\nconsider that those like Appiah-Waldron who think human dignity\ndepends on a refashioned idea of high social rank, must, strictly\nspeaking, reject the property of \u201cinherentness\u201d that\nFitzpatrick appeals to. But they might allow for the\nalternative description of \u201cunearned\u201d, especially if this\nis interpreted as historically indexed to the refashioned conception\nof status.\n\nMore important for the question about rights is to consider\nFitzpatrick\u2019s final remark that dignity, \u201ccalls for\ncertain forms of respect\u201d. At first blush, this appeal might\nseem to be merely a refinement of Debes\u2019s (2009) claim that\ndignity has a distinctive \u201cnormative function\u201d. If so, it\nwould be a refinement that is common to many theorists, as we already\nnoted in\n \u00a72.1.\n However, Fitzpatrick immediately connects this generic claim about\nrespect to two specific elaborations of dignity\u2019s normative\nfunction. He writes:\n\n\nIt is in this sense [of an inherent worth or standing that calls for\nrespect] that many hold that all persons possess a fundamental,\ninalienable dignity, which grounds \n [1] \n basic rights\u2026or \n [2] \n the authority to make claims and demands of others. (2013: 5546)\n\n\nBoth claims merit elaboration.\n\nThe first\n claim [1]\n gives voice to the strongest, or at least the most direct way to make\nthe connection to rights a defining property of dignity, by making\ndignity the normative basis of rights. Thus, suppose one asks\nof any given right x, what justifies the claim that\n\u201cx is a human right\u201d? The answer for those who\ntake this line is, \u201cdignity\u201d. Or at least, \u201chuman\ndignity\u201d.\n\nNow, in one sense,\n claim [1]\n is unsurprising given that it has legal reality. For example,\nalthough the claim is only implicit in the Universal Declaration\nof Human Rights (1948) as well as the original Charter of the\nUnited Nations (1945), a 1966 amendment to the Charter\nmade it explicit, declaring that rights \u201cderived from the\ninherent dignity of persons\u201d. Moreover, claims like this have\nbecome increasingly common in state constitutions, especially in the\nwest, as well as other international charters and humanitarian\ndeclarations (see, e.g., Schachter 1983, Iglesias 2001, Shultziner\n2007, and McCrudden 2008, for summaries and analysis).\n\nAnd yet, it is important to note that such legal claims are almost\nalways brute assertions. They are not conscientious attempts at\ntheory. More exactly, they do not claim that any adequate theory of\ndignity (as a concept) must account for the grounding\nrelationship between dignity and rights. This is important because,\npace FitzPatrick, or those like James Griffin (2008) who\nadamantly stress dignity as the foundation of rights, some theorists\nchallenge or avoid or even reject\n claim [1].\n This includes skeptics who challenge the viability of any existing\nsubstantive accounts of dignity to ground rights (discussed later).\nBut it also includes some theorists who defend dignity (in one form or\nother). For example, Waldron skirts around the kind of commitment at\nissue in claim [1]. He allows that dignity involves each person\nthinking of themselves, \u201cas a self-originating source of legal\nand moral claims\u201d (2012: 60), but the overarching implication of\nhis argument is that rights articulate the nature of the\n\u201chigh\u201d status humans have been elevated to. Dignity is\nthus not the normative basis of rights on his view. Instead,\nlegal systems, and rights in particular, \u201cconstitute and\nvindicate human dignity, both in their explicit provisions and in\ntheir overall modus operandi\u201d (2012: 67).\n\nKillmister (2020) follows Waldron\u2019s lead, but she is more\nexplicit. \u201c[H]uman rights\u201d, she argues, \u201cform part\nof our articulation of how members of the human kind ought to be\ntreated\u201d (2020: 143). And, like Shultziner (2007), she warns\nagainst attempts to derive the content of rights directly from\ndignity, a warning that further tells against making\n claim [1]\n part of the definitional criteria. Relatedly, Meyer (1989) concludes\nthat insofar as we aim to explain rights, we can never successfully\nexplain dignity: \u201cWhile having and exercising certain rights is\nimportant to our dignity as human beings\u201d, Meyer argues,\n\n\nwhat we commonly regard as essential to human dignity would not be\nexplained even if we were able to delineate all of the relevant rights\nand the particular ways in which each of them expresses or protects\nhuman dignity. (1989: 521)\n\n\nMeyer\u2019s point is enhanced (perhaps even preempted) by\nDonnelly\u2019s (1982) sociological claim that in cultures where\n\u201crights\u201d are or once were a relatively foreign concept,\nhuman dignity is not. If Donnelly is correct, then excepting\nmotivational purposes, rights theory is arguably a non-starter for a\nproper account of dignity\u2019s defining properties (see also,\nHoward 1992, who partly recapitulates Donnelly\u2019s point).\n\nPiling onto this, Schroeder (2012) and Moyn (2013) warn that the\n\u201cnormative basis\u201d version of the connection claim between\nrights and dignity\u2014i.e.,\n claim [1]\u2014leaves\n dignity vulnerable, because our contemporary concept of human dignity\ncarries underappreciated debts to non-secular, theological traditions\n(see also Addis 2013). And Valentini (2017) argues that the\nplausibility of claim [1] depends on which other defining properties\nof dignity we want to defend. Specifically, if dignity is taken to be\ninherent, she argues, then claim [1] becomes not only\n\u201cuninformative\u201d because \u201cthe notion of inherent\ndignity is opaque\u201d; it also becomes counterproductive to the\naims of most rights theories. This is because, she continues, the\ninherentness claim pushes rights debates, \u201cinto deep\nmetaphysical waters\u201d, and distracts us from the main political\nfunction of rights (especially, human rights), namely, to\nconstrain, \u201cthe conduct of powerful actors\u201d (2017:\n862\u20133).\n\nNow consider connection\n claim [2]:\n dignity grounds the authority to make claims in general.\nSome have argued that the first connection\n claim [1],\n which makes dignity the normative basis of rights, is ultimately just\na special case of the second claim [2], about authority. Perhaps most\nwell-known in this respect is Feinberg (1970 [1980]), who, in the\ncourse of arguing that the act or practice of making interpersonal\nclaims is what \u201cgives rights their special moral\nsignificance\u201d, adds this passing remark about dignity:\n\u201cwhat is called \u2018human dignity\u2019 may simply\nbe the recognizable capacity to assert claims\u201d (1970\n[1980: 151]). Admittedly, Feinberg does not unpack the point. And it\nis not perfectly clear if authority per se is part of his conception\nof this \u201ccapacity\u201d. Still, the point seems to resonate\nwith claim [2], especially if we pair Feinberg\u2019s point with\nDarwall\u2019s views about second-personal authority, considered\nearlier. Indeed, Meyer (1989) tries to unpack Feinberg in a way that\nseems to anticipate Darwall\u2019s view. (See also, Forst 2011, who\noffers a similar line of argument to Darwall, which he credits partly\nto Ernst Bloch. But see Sangiovanni 2017, who objects to both Darwall\nand Forst, esp. pp. 50\u201360).\n",
