    "main_text": "High Tide: The Dial, Fuller, Thoreau\n2. High Tide: The Dial, Fuller, Thoreau\n\nThe transcendentalists had several publishing outlets: at first\nThe Christian Examiner, then, after the furor over the\n\u201cDivinity School Address,\u201d The Western Messenger\n(1835\u201341) in St Louis, then the Boston Quarterly Review\n(1838\u201344). The Dial (1840\u20134) was a special case,\nfor it was planned and instituted by the members of the Transcendental\nClub, with Margaret Fuller (1810\u201350) as the first editor.\nEmerson succeeded her for the magazine\u2019s last two years. The\nwriting in The Dial was uneven, but in its four years of\nexistence it published Fuller\u2019s \u201cThe Great Lawsuit\u201d\n(the core of her Woman in the Nineteenth Century) and her\nlong review of Goethe\u2019s work; prose and poetry by Emerson;\nAlcott\u2019s \u201cOrphic Sayings\u201d (which gave the magazine a\nreputation for silliness); and the first publications of a young\nfriend of Emerson\u2019s, Henry David Thoreau (1817\u201362). After\nEmerson became editor in 1842 The Dial published a series of\n\u201cEthnical Scriptures,\u201d translations from Chinese and\nIndian philosophical works.\n\nMargaret Fuller was the daughter of a Massachusetts congressman who\nprovided tutors for her in Latin, Greek, chemistry, philosophy and,\nlater, German. Exercising what Barbara Packer calls \u201cher\npeculiar powers of intrusion and caress\u201d (P, 443), Fuller became\nfriends with many of the transcendentalists, including Emerson. In the\nwinters of 1839\u201344, Fuller organized a series of popular and\ninfluential \u201cconversations\u201d for women in Elizabeth\nPeabody\u2019s bookstore in Boston. She journeyed to the Midwest in\nthe summer of 1843, and published her observations as Summer on\nthe Lakes the following year. After this publishing success,\nHorace Greeley, a friend of Emerson\u2019s and the editor of the\nNew York Tribune, invited her to New York to write for the\nTribune. Fuller abandoned her previously ornate and\npretentious style, issuing pithy reviews and forthright criticisms:\nfor example, of Longfellow\u2019s poetry and Carlyle\u2019s\nattraction to brutality. Fuller was in Europe from 1846\u20139,\nsending back hundreds of pages for the Tribune. On her return\nto America with her husband and son, she drowned in a hurricane off\nthe coast of Fire Island, New York.\n\nWoman in the Nineteenth Century (1845), a revision of her\n\u201cGreat Lawsuit\u201d manifesto in The Dial, is\nFuller\u2019s major philosophical work. She holds that masculinity\nand femininity pass into one another, that there is \u201cno wholly\nmasculine man, no purely feminine woman\u201d (T, 418). In classical\nmythology, for example, \u201cMan partakes of the feminine in the\nApollo; woman of the Masculine as Minerva.\u201d But there are\ndifferences. The feminine genius is \u201celectrical\u201d and\n\u201cintuitive,\u201d the male more inclined to classification (T,\n419). Women are treated as dependents, however, and their self-reliant\nimpulses are often held against them. What they most want, Fuller\nmaintains, is the freedom to unfold their powers, a freedom necessary\nnot only for their self-development, but for the renovation of\nsociety. Like Thoreau and Emerson, Fuller calls for periods of\nwithdrawal from a society whose members are in various states of\n\u201cdistraction\u201d and \u201cimbecility,\u201d and a return\nonly after \u201cthe renovating fountains\u201d of individuality\nhave risen up. Such individuality is necessary in particular for the\nproper constitution of that form of society known as marriage.\n\u201cUnion,\u201d she holds, \u201cis only possible to those who\nare units\u201d (T, 419). In contrast, most marriages are forms of\ndegradation, in which \u201cthe woman does belong to the man, instead\nof forming a whole with him\u201d (T, 422).\n\nHenry Thoreau studied Latin, Greek, Italian, French, German, and\nSpanish at Harvard, where he heard Emerson\u2019s \u201cThe American\nScholar\u201d as the commencement address in 1837. He first published\nin The Dial when Emerson commissioned him to review a series\nof reports on wildlife by the state of Massachusetts, but he cast\nabout for a literary outlet after The Dial\u2019s failure in\n1844. In 1845, his move to Walden Pond allowed him to complete his\nfirst book, A Week on the Concord and the Merrimac Rivers. He\nalso wrote a first draft of Walden, which eventually appeared\nin 1854.\n\nNature comes to even more prominence in Walden than in\nEmerson\u2019s Nature, which it followed by eighteen years.\nNature now becomes particular: this tree, this bird, this state of the\npond on a summer evening or winter morning become Thoreau\u2019s\nsubjects. Thoreau is receptive. He finds himself \u201csuddenly\nneighbor to\u201d rather than a hunter of birds (W, 85); and he\nlearns to dwell in a house that is no more and no less than a place\nwhere he can properly sit. From the right perspective, Thoreau finds,\nhe can possess and use a farm with more satisfaction than the farmer,\nwho is preoccupied with feeding his family and expanding his\noperations.\n\nIn Walden\u2019s opening chapter, \u201cEconomy,\u201d\nThoreau considers the trade-offs we make in life, and he asks, as\nPlato did in The Republic, what are life\u2019s real\nnecessities. Like the Roman philosophers Marcus Porcius Cato and\nMarcus Varro he seeks a \u201clife of simplicity, independence,\nmagnanimity, and trust\u201d (W, 15). Considering his contemporaries,\nhe finds that \u201cthe mass of men lead lives of quiet\ndesperation\u201d (W, 8). Thoreau\u2019s \u201cexperiment\u201d at\nWalden shows that a life of simplicity and independence can be\nachieved today (W, 17). If Thoreau counsels simple frugality\u2014a\nvegetarian diet for example, and a dirt floor\u2014he also counsels a\nkind of extravagance, a spending of what you have in the day that\nshall never come again. True economy, he writes, is a matter of\n\u201cimproving the nick of time\u201d (W, 17).\n\nThoreau went to Walden Pond on the anniversary of America\u2019s\ndeclared independence from Britain\u2014July 4, 1845, declaring his\nown independence from a society that is \u201ccommonly too\ncheap.\u201d It is not that he is against all society, but that he\nfinds we meet too often, before we have had the chance to acquire any\n\u201cnew value for each other\u201d (W, 136). Thoreau welcomes\nthose visitors who \u201cspeak reservedly and thoughtfully\u201d (W,\n141), and who preserve an appropriate sense of distance; he values the\nlittle leaves or acorns left by visitors he never meets. Thoreau lived\nat Walden for just under three years, a time during which he sometimes\nvisited friends and conducted business in town. (It was on one such\nvisit, to pick up a mended shoe, that he was arrested for tax\navoidance, an episode that became the occasion for \u201cResistance\nto Civil Government.\u201d)\n\nAt the opening of Walden\u2019s chapter on \u201cHigher Laws\u201d\nThoreau confesses to once having desired to slaughter a woodchuck and\neat it raw, just to get at its wild essence. He values fishing and\nhunting for their taste of wildness, though he finds that in middle\nage he has given up eating meat. He finds wildness not only in the\nwoods, but in such literary works as Hamlet and the\nIliad; and even in certain forms of society: \u201cThe\nwildness of the savage is but a faint symbol of the awful ferity with\nwhich good men and lovers meet\u201d (\u201cWalking\u201d (1862),\np. 621). The wild is not always consoling or uplifting, however. In\nThe Maine Woods, Thoreau records a climb on Mount Ktaadn in\nMaine when he confronted the alien materiality of the world; and in\nCape Cod (1865), he records the foreignness, not the\nfriendliness, of nature: the shore is \u201ca wild, rank place, and\nthere is no flattery in it\u201d (P, 577).\n\nAlthough Walden initiates the American tradition of\nenvironmental philosophy, it is equally concerned with reading and\nwriting. In the chapter on \u201cReading,\u201d Thoreau speaks of\nbooks that demand and inspire \u201creading, in a high sense\u201d\n(W, 104). He calls such books \u201cheroic,\u201d and finds them\nequally in literature and philosophy, in Europe and Asia: \u201cVedas\nand Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and Dantes and\nShakespeares\u2026\u201d (W, 104). Thoreau suggests that\nWalden is or aspires to be such a book; and indeed the\nenduring construction from his time at Walden is not the cabin he\nbuilt but the book he wrote.\n\nThoreau maintains in Walden that writing is \u201cthe work\nof art closest to life itself\u201d (W, 102). In his search for such\ncloseness, he began to reconceive the nature of his journal. Both he\nand Emerson kept journals from which their published works were\nderived. But in the early 1850s, Thoreau began to conceive of the\njournal as a work in itself, \u201ceach page of which should be\nwritten in its own season & out of doors or in its own locality\nwherever it may be\u201d (J, 67). A journal has a sequence set by the\ndays, but it may have no order; or what order it has emerges in the\nwriter\u2019s life as he meets the life of nature. With its chapters\non \u201cReading,\u201d \u201cSolitude,\u201d\n\u201cEconomy,\u201d \u201cWinter,\u201d and \u201cSpring,\u201d\nWalden is more \u201cworked up\u201d than the journal; in\nthis sense, Thoreau came to feel, it is less close to nature than the\njournal.\n",
