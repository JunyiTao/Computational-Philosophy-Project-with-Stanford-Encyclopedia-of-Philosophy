    "main_text": "Hylomorphism in General\n2. Hylomorphism in General\n\n\nIn De Anima, Aristotle makes extensive use of technical\nterminology introduced and explained elsewhere in his writings. He\nclaims, for example, using vocabulary derived from his physical and\nmetaphysical theories, that the soul is a \u201cfirst actuality of a\nnatural organic body\u201d (De Anima ii 1, 412b5\u20136), that it\nis a \u201csubstance as form of a natural body which has life in\npotentiality\u201d (De Anima ii 1, 412a20\u20131) and, similarly,\nthat it \u201cis a first actuality of a natural body which has life in\npotentiality\u201d (De Anima ii 1, 412a27\u20138), all claims\nwhich apply to plants, animals and humans alike.\n\n\nIn characterizing the soul and body in these ways, Aristotle applies\nconcepts drawn from his broader hylomorphism, a conceptual\nframework which underlies virtually all of his mature theorizing. It is\naccordingly necessary to begin with a brief overview of that framework.\nThereafter it will be possible to recount Aristotle\u2019s general approach\nto soul-body relations, and then, finally, to consider his analyses of\nthe individual faculties of soul.\n\n\n\u2018Hylomorphism\u2019 is simply a compound word composed of the\nGreek terms for matter (hul\u00ea) and form or shape\n(morph\u00ea); thus one could equally describe Aristotle\u2019s\nview of body and soul as an instance of his\n\u201cmatter-formism.\u201d That is, when he introduces the soul as\nthe form of the body, which in turn is said to be the\nmatter of the soul, Aristotle treats soul-body relations as a\nspecial case of a more general relationship which obtains between the\ncomponents of all generated compounds, natural or artifactual.\n\n\nThe notions of form and matter are themselves, however, developed\nwithin the context of a general theory of causation and explanation\nwhich appears in one guise or another in all of Aristotle\u2019s mature\nworks. According to this theory, when we wish to explain what there is\nto know, for example, about a bronze statue, a complete account\nnecessarily alludes to at least the following four factors: the\nstatue\u2019s matter, its form or structure, the agent responsible for that\nmatter manifesting its form or structure, and the purpose for which the\nmatter was made to realize that form or structure. These four factors\nhe terms the four causes (aitiai):\n\n\nThe material cause: that from which something\nis generated and out of which it is made, e.g. the bronze of a\nstatue.\n\n\nThe formal cause: the structure which the\nmatter realizes and in terms of which the matter comes to be something\ndeterminate, e.g., the Hermes shape in virtue of which this quantity of\nbronze is said to be a statue of Hermes.\n\n\nThe efficient cause: the agent responsible\nfor a quantity of matter\u2019s coming to be informed, e.g. the sculptor who\nshaped the quantity of bronze into its current Hermes shape.\n\n\nThe final cause: the purpose or goal of the\ncompound of form and matter, e.g. the statue was created for the\npurpose of honoring Hermes.\n\n\n\n\nFor a broad range of cases, Aristotle implicitly makes twin claims\nabout these four causes: (i) a complete explanation requires reference\nto all four; and (ii) once such reference is made, no further\nexplanation is required. Thus, when appropriate, appeal to the four\ncauses is both necessary and sufficient for completeness and adequacy\nin explanation. Although not all things which admit of explanation have\nall four causes, e.g., geometrical figures are not efficiently caused,\neven a brief overview of his psychological writings reveals that\nAristotle regards all four causes as in play in the explanation of\nliving beings. A monkey, for example, has matter, its body; form, its\nsoul; an efficient cause, its parent; and a final cause, its function.\nMoreover, he holds that the form is the actuality of the body\nwhich is its matter: an indeterminate lump of bronze becomes a statue\nonly when it realizes some particular statue-shape. So, Aristotle\nsuggests, matter is potentially some F until it\nacquires an actualizing form, when it becomes actually F.\nGiven his overarching explanatory schema, it is hardly surprising that\nAristotle should advance a hylomorphic account of soul and body; this\nis, for him, standard explanatory procedure.\n\n\nStill, it is noteworthy that this four-causal framework of\nexplanation was developed initially in response to some puzzles about\nchange and generation. Aristotle argues with some justification that\nall change and generation require the existence of something complex:\nwhen a statue comes to be from a lump of bronze, there is some\ncontinuing subject, the bronze, and something it comes to acquire, its\nnew form. Thus the statue is, and must be, a certain kind of compound,\none of form and matter. Without this type of complexity, generation\nwould be impossible; since generation in fact occurs, form and matter\nmust be genuine features of generated compounds. Similarly, but less\nobviously, qualitative change requires much the same apparatus: when a\nstatue is painted, there is some continuing subject, the statue, and a\nnew feature acquired, its new color. Here too there is complexity, and\ncomplexity which is readily articulated in terms of form and matter,\nbut now of form which is evidently inessential to the continued\nexistence of the entity whose form it is. The statue continues to\nexist, but receives a form which is accidental to it; it might lose\nthat form without going out of existence. By contrast, should the\nstatue lose its essential form, as would happen for example if the\nbronze which constitutes it were melted, divided, and recast as twelve\ndozen letter openers, it would cease to exist altogether.\n\n\nFor the purposes of understanding Aristotle\u2019s psychology, the\norigin of Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism is significant for two\nreasons. First, from its inception, Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism\nexploits two distinct but related notions of form, one of which is\nessential to the compound whose form it is, and the other of which is\naccidental to its subject.  In advancing his view of the soul and its\ncapacities, Aristotle employs both of these notions: the soul is an\nessential form, whereas perception involves the acquisition of\naccidental forms. Second, because Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphism was\ninitially developed to handle puzzles of change and generation, its\ndeployment in philosophical psychology is sometimes strained, insofar\nas Aristotle is not immediately willing to treat every instance of\nperception and thought as a straightforward instance of change in some\ncontinuing subject.  Moreover, as we shall see, it is sometimes\ndifficult to appreciate how Aristotle can justifiably regard the body\nas the matter of a human being in the way that the bronze is held to\nbe the matter of a statue.  Bronze can exist as an indeterminate lump,\nbeing potentially but not actually the statue of a great hero. There\nis no ready analogue in the case of the body: the body is not so much\nstuff lying about waiting to be enformed by a soul. Rather, in one\nimportant sense, human bodies become human bodies by being\nensouled. If so, then they seem ill-suited to play the role of matter\nin precisely those terms given by Aristotle\u2019s hylomorphic theory\nof generation.\n",
