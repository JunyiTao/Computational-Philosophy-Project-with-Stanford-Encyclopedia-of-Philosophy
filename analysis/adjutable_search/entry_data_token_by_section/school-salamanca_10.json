    "main_text": "Metaphysics and Logic || Soto on Logic\n8.1 Soto on Logic\n\nSoto is regarded as responsible for the revival of Spanish-Thomist\nlogic, as distinct from both Renaissance-oriented logic, which used\nonly ancient sources, and the extremely technical\n\u201csophistic\u201d logic of Nominalism. His main sources were\nAristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Petrus Hispanus\u2019s Summulae\nlogicales, from all of which, however, he deviated in many areas.\nIn his Summulae, especially starting with the second edition\nof 1547, which became one of the most influential textbooks of this\ngenre, he gives an introduction to traditional logic, including a\ntheory of terms, propositions and conclusions (Soto 1980). Whereas\nPetrus Hispanus had been criticized for serious inconsistencies, Soto\ngives his own interpretation, in an effort to build up a coherent\ndoctrine. In the presentation of the different kinds of terms, he did\nnot follow the Aristotelian categories, but instead presented the\nmedieval distinctions between mental, written and spoken terms,\nbetween categorematic and syncategorematic terms (that is, terms that\nhave a meaning because they refer to things, concepts or other terms\nand those which only make sense within propositions as connections,\nbut cannot be a subject or predicate, such as \u201cif\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc.), between absolute and connotative terms, and\nso on. He continued by presenting different kinds of proposition,\nincluding a version of supposition theory\u2014the doctrine of the\nentities that the terms in a proposition, subject and predicate stand\nfor (ibid., 31\u201336). Here Soto also discussed Nominalist and\nrealist objections; but, in the end, he mostly defended the positions\nof Petrus Hispanus, largely omitting, however, complicated types of\nsupposition such as distributive, confused, merely confused, etc.,\nwhich had long puzzled medieval authors. The third book explains the\ndifferent kinds of relation between propositions, including an\nextended version of the square of oppositions (ibid., 72), as well as\ntruth conditions for modal propositions, conjunctions and\ndisjunctions. In his discussion of the different kinds of valid and\ninvalid conclusion, Soto not only referred to syllogisms (book 5) and\nthe so-called insolubilia, or reflections on paradoxes (book\n6), but also elements of the theory of consequentiae, a\nmedieval type of logical conclusion that may go back to the Stoic\nlogic of propositions (Read 1993; D\u2019Ors 1983).\n\nWhile the Summulae provide something like a basic\nintroduction to the logical topics discussed at the time, Soto\u2019s\nIn dialecticam Aristotelis commentarii (Salamanca, 1543)\ncontains philosophical reflections on questions such as whether logic\nis a science and if so, what kind of logic, the logica docens\nin contrast to logica utens, which is a \u201cmode of\nknowing\u201d, and whether the subject of dialectics is an ens\nrationis (Di Liso 2000: 221\u2013250). These reflections are\npresented within the context of a selective commentary on the\nAristotelian Organon, omitting De interpretatione and the\nAnalytica Priora, which were treated in the Summulae\n(ibid.). He also wrote Super octo libros Physicorum\ncommentarii and Super octo libros Physicorum quaestiones\nas part of the Artes liberales course.\n",
