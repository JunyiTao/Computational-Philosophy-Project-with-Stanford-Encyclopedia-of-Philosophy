Some Minor Issues Arising\n\nThere are a number of much-debated issues that arise in connection\nwith the interpretation of various parts of Turing (1950), and that we\nhave hitherto neglected to discuss. What has been said in the first\ntwo sections of this document amounts to our interpretation of what\nTuring has to say (perhaps bolstered with what we take to be further\nrelevant considerations in those cases where Turing\u2019s remarks\ncan be fairly readily improved upon). But since some of this\ninterpretation has been contested, it is probably worth noting where\nthe major points of controversy have been.\n",
