    "main_text": "Two Kinds of Analysis of the Concept\n2. Two Kinds of Analysis of the Concept\n\nThe history of the concept religion above shows how its\nsenses have shifted over time. A concept used for scrupulous devotion\nwas retooled to refer to a particular type of social practice. But the\nquestion\u2014what type?\u2014is now convoluted. The cosmic version\nof the concept is broader than the polytheistic version, which is in\nturn broader than the theistic version, and the functional definitions\nshift the sense of the term into a completely different register. What\nis counted as religion by one definition is often not counted by\nothers. How might this disarray be understood? Does the concept have a\nstructure? This section distinguishes between two kinds of answer to\nthese questions. Most of the attempts to analyze the term have been\n\u201cmonothetic\u201d in that they operate with the classical view\nthat every instance that is accurately described by a concept will\nshare a defining property that puts them in that category. The last\nseveral decades, however, have seen the emergence of\n\u201cpolythetic\u201d approaches that abandon the classical view\nand treat religion, instead, as having a prototype structure.\nFor incisive explanations of the classical theory and the prototype\ntheory of concepts, see Laurence and Margolis (1999).\n",
