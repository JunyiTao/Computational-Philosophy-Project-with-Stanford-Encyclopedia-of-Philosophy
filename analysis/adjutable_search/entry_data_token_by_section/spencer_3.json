    "main_text": "Political Rights\n5. Political Rights\n\nNot only was Spencer less than a \u201csocial Darwinist\u201d as we\nhave come to understand social Darwinism, but he was also less\nunambiguously libertarian as some, such as Eric Mack and Tibor Machan,\nhave made him out to be. Not only his underlying utilitarianism but\nalso the distinction, which he never forswears, between \u201crights\nproperly so-called\u201d and \u201cpolitical\u201d rights, makes it\nproblematic to read him as what we would call a\n\u2018libertarian\u2019.\n\nWhereas \u201crights properly so-called\u201d are authentic\nspecifications of equal freedom, \u201cpolitical rights\u201d are\nnot. They are interim devices conditional on our moral imperfection.\nInsofar as we remain morally imperfect requiring government\nenforcement of moral rights proper, political rights insure that\ngovernment nevertheless remains mostly benign, never unduly violating\nmoral rights proper themselves. The \u201cright to ignore the\nstate\u201d and the right of universal suffrage are two essential\npolitical rights for Spencer. In Social Statics, Spencer says\n\u201cwe cannot choose but admit the right of the citizen to adopt a\ncondition of voluntary outlawry.\u201d Every citizen is \u201cfree\nto drop connection with the state \u2013 to relinquish its protection\nand to refuse paying for its support\u201d (Spencer, 1970: 185). For\nSpencer, this right helps restrict government to protecting proper\nmoral rights because it allows citizens to take their business\nelsewhere when it doesn\u2019t.\n\nHowever, Spencer eventually repudiated this mere political\nright.\u00a0 For instance, in his 1894 An Autobiography, he\ninsists that since citizens \u201ccannot avoid benefiting by the\nsocial order which government maintains,\u201d they have no right to\nopt out from its protection (Spencer, 1904, vol. 1: 362). They may not\nlegitimately take their business elsewhere whenever they feel that\ntheir fundamental moral rights are being ill-protected. Because he\neventually repudiated the \u201cright to ignore the state,\u201d we\nshould not interpret Spencer as he comes across in Nozick 1974 (p.\n289\u2013290, footnote 10, the text of which is on p. 350), where he is\nreferenced in support of such a right.\n\nSpencer\u2019s commitment to the right of universal suffrage likewise\nwanes in his later writings. Whereas in Social Statics, he\nregards universal suffrage as a dependable means of preventing\ngovernment from overreaching its duty of sticking to protecting moral\nrights proper, by the later Principles of Ethics he concludes\nthat universal suffrage fails to do this effectively and so he\nabandons his support of it. He later concluded that universal suffrage\nthreatened respect for moral rights more than it protected them.\u00a0\nUniversal suffrage, especially when extended to women, encouraged\n\u201cover-legislation,\u201d allowing government to take up\nresponsibilities which were none of its business.\n\nSpencer, then, was more than willing to modify political rights in\nkeeping with his changing assessment of how well they secured basic\nmoral rights on whose sanctity promoting happiness depended. The more\nhe became convinced that certain political rights were accordingly\ncounterproductive, the more readily he forsook them and the less\ndemocratic, if not patently libertarian, he became.\n\nLikewise, Spencer\u2019s declining enthusiasm for land\nnationalization (which Hillel Steiner has recently found so\ninspiring), coupled with growing doubts that it followed as a\ncorollary from the principle of equal freedom, testify to his waning\n radicalism.[20]\n According to Spencer in Social Statics, denying every\ncitizen the right to use of the earth equally was a \u201ccrime\ninferior only in wickedness to the crime of taking away their lives or\npersonal liberties\u201d (Spencer: 1970, 182.)\u00a0 Private land\nownership was incompatible with equal freedom because it denied most\ncitizens equal access to the earth\u2019s surface on which faculty\nexercise and happiness ultimately depended. However, by The\nPrinciples of Ethics, Spencer abandoned advocating comprehensive\nland nationalization, much to Henry George\u2019s ire. George, an\nAmerican, had previously regarded Spencer as a formidable ally in his\ncrusade to abolish private land tenure.\n\nNow Spencer\u2019s repudiation of the moral right to use the earth\nand the political right to ignore the state, as well as the political\nright of universal suffrage, undermines his distinction between\nrational and empirical utilitarianism. In forswearing the right to use\nthe earth \u2014 because he subsequently became convinced that land\nnationalization undermined, rather than promoted general utility\n\u2014 Spencer betrays just how much of a traditional empirical\nutilitarian he was. He abandoned land nationalization not because he\nconcluded that the right to use the earth did not follow deductively\nfrom the principle of equal freedom. Rather, he abandoned land reform\nsimply because he became convinced that it was an empirically\ncounterproductive strategy for promoting utility.\n\nEven more obviously, by repudiating political rights like the\n\u201cright to ignore the state\u201d and universal suffrage rights,\nhe similarly divulged just how much empirical utilitarian\nconsiderations trumped all else in his practical reasoning. Not only\nwas Spencer not a committed or consistent libertarian, but he was not\nmuch of rational utilitarian either. In the end, Spencer was mostly,\nto repeat, what we would now call a liberal utilitarian who, much like\nMill, tried to combine strong rights with utility though, in\nSpencer\u2019s case, he regarded moral rights as indefeasible.\n",
