    "main_text": "Conceptions of language in Indian philosophy || Appeals to Phenomenology\n1.2 Appeals to Phenomenology\nDefinitions of meaning often appeal to phenomenology, the way in which a cognition seems to arise from hearing a word or sentence. This focus on the psychology of language use is found in all three disciplines. For example, the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 (\u201cHermeneutics\u201d) philosopher Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (ca 7th century CE, see entry on Kum\u0101rila) writes in his Exposition on Ritual Practice (Tantrav\u0101rttika, hereafter TV) that, like a face, the primary meaning is perceived first, before anything else, such as secondary meaning (TV 3.2.1). (The Sanskrit word for a face is mukha, etymologically related to mukhya, the term for primary meaning.) The Grammarian Bhart\u1e5bhari argues in his Treatise on Sentences and Words (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya) that division of sentences into words and phonemes is artificial. This is in part based his observation that hearers experience meaning as a unified whole. He claims that what conveys meaning is a spho\u1e6da, or \u201cburst,\u201d which is partless and different from the sequence of sounds composing a sentence (see section 4.3 and Matilal (1990: 84ff) for discussion about how precisely to characterize spho\u1e6da in relationship to meaning.)\nAesthetic theorists focus on the psychology of the poet and the hearer, in part to understand the relationship between ordinary language and poetic language, but also to distinguish among the varieties of poetic utterances. Among the psychological principles widely accepted by Indian thinkers is that ordinary conventional meanings are stronger than analytically-determined ones (Raja 1969). So the term pa\u1e45ka-ja has constituent parts which together mean \u201cmud-born\u201d but conventionally it refers to the lotus, and the latter meaning would come to a hearer\u2019s mind first. Aesthetic philosopher Mukula Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da argues in his Fundamentals of the Communicative Function (Abhidh\u0101v\u1e5bttam\u0101t\u1e5bk\u0101) that some words become so conventionalized that their status as secondary meaning is unavailable to the speaker, who takes herself to be speaking literally (McCrea 2008, Keating 2019).\nHowever, there is a limit to the role that reflection on psychology plays in the analysis of meaning. For early M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 philosophers, only Sanskrit terms have genuine expressive capacities.This conclusion is not due to an investigation of the psychology of non-Sanskrit speakers, but the principle of parsimony. It is explanatorily better to posit a fundamental language, where word and meaning are fixed in one-to-one correspondence, which has been corrupted by mispronunciation over time (see TV 1.3.24ff). So, hearing a foreign word like gavi, people understand its meaning, \u201ccow,\u201d through its similarity with the correct Sanskrit word (gau\u1e25), whether or not they are aware of the process. This view is challenged by other philosophers, such as Dharmak\u012brti in his V\u0101dany\u0101ya (Norms of Debate).\n",
