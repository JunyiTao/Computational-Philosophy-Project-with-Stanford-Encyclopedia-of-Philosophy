    "main_text": "Aesthetics and Everyday Life\n6. Aesthetics and Everyday Life\n\nAs is evident from the foregoing discussion, one can find in feminist\nphilosophy avenues of thought that direct inquiry away from the worlds\nof art and to the presence of aesthetic features in lived experience.\nArt and aesthetic qualities are obviously not merely theoretical\nobjects; they are cultural products with considerable authority to\nframe and to perpetuate social relations and values. Therefore\nfeminist aesthetics contains a component where theories of\ninterpretation are directed to particular works of culture. Such\nperspectives are poised to illuminate the changes in social\ninstitutions that are depicted in popular art forms such as literature\nand film, revealing the large-scale influence that aspects of the\npolitical feminist movement have had over marriage and family\nrelations (S.T. Ross 2016). Aesthetic norms are not limited to art but\nextend into virtually all aspects of life, including dress, personal\nadornment, and comportment. With dress, for example, perceived\naesthetic incongruity has political resonance, as with Muslim women\nwho choose to wear the hijab in countries where such garb has not been\na historical norm (Sheth 2009, 2019). Feminist perspectives extend to\nthe aesthetic frames of lived experience and the subtle forces they\nexert (Archer and Ware 2018).\n\nThe turn of attention to the body and its appearance, as well as to\ndomestic environments, has contributed to an area of interest loosely\nlabeled \u201ceveryday aesthetics.\u201d Scholarship on everyday\naesthetics includes examination of craft practices, which are often\npursued in the home where many women continue to work, and to artistic\ntraditions that do not feature a distinction between \u201cfine\nart\u201d and \u201ccraft,\u201d such as the cultural traditions of\nAsia (Saito 2007, 2017; Mandoki 2007; Leddy 2012; Light and Smith\n2004). Cooking, eating, arranging furniture and shelves,\ngardening\u2014all these quotidian activities have aesthetic features (for\ngardening see S. Ross 1998; Miller 1993). Such activities are not\nalways uplifting or even pleasant, but attention to their sensuous\ncharacter, the rhythm they impose on the day, week, or year, and their\nplace in the patterns of life, disperses aesthetic attention to\nregions that are relatively new to theory, if widely familiar in\nexperience.\n\nFeminist analyses both contribute to the development of this field of\ninterest and occupy a place within it. For example, there is a growing\nbody of philosophy that explores issues about food and eating, which\nare topics that hitherto had little to no position in the field at all\n(Korsmeyer 1999). This new subject has several sources of development,\nincluding feminism, for it can be considered an area of scholarship\nthat has been nurtured by the overall critical questioning of dominant\nconceptual frameworks in philosophy, including those that overlooked\nmatters relevant to the practical and physical realities of\nliving.\n\nOf special pertinence for topics concerning women and gender in\neveryday aesthetics is the rise of attention to a subject absent in\nprevious philosophies: pregnancy and motherhood\u2014topics also explored\nin contemporary feminist and postfeminist art, as noted above (Lintott\nand Sander-Staudt 2011). The aesthetics of the body here explores the\nmaternal body, its changes during pregnancy, birth, and nursing, and\nthe everyday demands of parenthood, within and among which feminists\nhave explored the beautiful, the sublime, the novel and unsettling,\nthe comforting and tranquil\u2014as manifest in the events and activities\none encounters every day. The area of inquiry here is not the\ndepiction of these subjects in art or literature, or their\ndramatization in theater or film, but the aesthetics of the lived\nexperience itself. Raising children has an inevitable sensuousness\nthat provides its own aesthetic dimensions, and sometimes what is\noff-putting or disgusting to others becomes part of the relationship\nof mother to child (Irvin 2011). Attending to the intimacy of\nsensation and to the presentation of one\u2019s own body serves to\ndetach theorizing in aesthetics away from art worlds and to everyday\npractice, and theory has expanded accordingly. In such ways are\ntraditional philosophical categories modified and adapted as feminist\nperspectives continue to probe the dimensions of the aesthetic.\n",
