Conflicting Principles\n\nGrice (1975: 30) recognized that his maxims may \u201cclash\u201d.\nWhen they do, there is no way to determine what is required for\nconformity to the Cooperative Principle. In the case of irony, for\nexample, Manner clashes with Quality. When Don said \u201cThe\nweather\u2019s lovely\u201d, we cannot interpret him as meaning what\nhe said because on that interpretation he would be violating Quality.\nBut we cannot interpret him as meaning the opposite because then he\nwould be violating Manner (Wilson & Sperber 2012: 18\u20139). It\nis more perspicuous to explicitly state something than to implicate\nit.\n\nWe use irony and other figures in part because we have conversational\ngoals other than the efficient communication of information (Lakoff\n1977; Sainsbury 1984: 427\u20139). We observe not only the\nCooperative Principle, but also the Principle of Style.\n\n\nPrinciple of Style: Be stylish, so be beautiful,\ndistinctive, entertaining, and interesting.\n\n\nClear and simple prose\u2014\u201cjust the facts,\nplease\u201d\u2014can be boring, tedious and dull. We liven up our\nwriting with figures of speech. Metaphor in particular makes speech\nmore interesting and insightful by engaging our imagination (Lepore\n& Stone 2015: Ch. 10). In the process, we sacrifice perspicuity\n(violating Manner). We sometimes \u201cembellish\u201d a narration\nto make it more interesting (violating Quality) and delete boring or\nugly details even when they are important (violating Quantity).\n\nThe Gricean maxims often clash with the Principle of Politeness,\nemphasized by Leech\n (1983).[47]\n\n\nPrinciple of Politeness: Be polite, so be tactful,\nrespectful, generous, praising, modest, deferential, and\nsympathetic.\n\n\nSpeakers frequently withhold information that would be offensive or\ndisappointing to the hearer, violating Quantity. Speakers often\nexaggerate in order to please or flatter, and utter \u201cwhite\nlies\u201d in order to spare the hearer\u2019s feelings, violating\nQuality. People pick \u201csafe topics\u201d (e.g., the weather) to\nstress agreement and communicate an interest in maintaining good\nrelations, violating Relation. Euphemisms avoid mentioning the\nunmentionable, but in the process violate Manner.\n\nOne common motive for implicating something is that it is often\nperceived to be more polite than asserting it (Pinker 2007; Huang\n2014: 142; Haugh 2015: 2). In case\n (1),\n Barb may have answered Alan\u2019s question indirectly because she\nthinks it is less likely to hurt his feelings, even if she realizes he\nwill assume that is what she is doing.\n\nBlome-Tillmann (2013a: 177) has suggested that problems such as\novergeneration and conflicting principles can be avoided by\nunderstanding calculability not as a way of predicting and explaining\nimplicatures, but merely as providing a criterion for them.  But\nif a criterion always gives false positives (overgeneration) or false\nnegatives (indeterminacy), or cannot be applied (due to clashes), then\nit is not a useful criterion.\n",
