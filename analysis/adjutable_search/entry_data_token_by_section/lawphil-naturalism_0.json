Varieties of Naturalism: Methodological and Substantive\n\nDifferent philosophical doctrines travel under the heading of\n\u201cnaturalism.\u201d We can usefully distinguish two broad and\nimportant categories: methodological naturalism (or\nM-naturalism) and substantive naturalism (or\nS-naturalism) (Leiter 1998; cf. Railton 1990 and Goldman 1994).\nNaturalism in philosophy is most often a methodological view\nto the effect that philosophical theorizing should be continuous with\nempirical inquiry in the sciences. Such a view need not presuppose a\nsolution to the so-called \u201cdemarcation\nproblem\u201d\u2014i.e., the problem of what demarcates genuine\nscience from pseudo-science\u2014as long as there remain clear,\nparadigmatic cases of successful sciences. Some M-naturalists want\n\u201ccontinuity with\u201d only the hard or\nphysical sciences; others seek \u201ccontinuity with\u201d\nany successful science, natural or social. The latter is probably the\ndominant strand in philosophy today.\n\nFor M-naturalists, \u201ccontinuity with\u201d the sciences\nincludes, in the first instance, the Quinean repudiation of a\n\u201cfirst philosophy\u201d\u2014that is, philosophical inquiry\nthat proceeds entirely a priori and without the benefit\nof empirical evidence. (Most M-naturalists do not go as far as Quine,\nhowever, in repudiating any role for a priori\nconceptual analysis: see, e.g., Goldman 1986 for a more typical\nM-naturalist approach.) Beyond hostility to methods that are\nexclusively a priori, M-naturalists require continuity with\nthe sciences in two more precise senses, which we may call\n\u201cResults Continuity\u201d and \u201cMethods\nContinuity.\u201d\n\nResults Continuity requires that the substantive claims of\nphilosophical theories be supported or justified by the results of the\nsciences. For example, epistemologists like Goldman look to the\nresults of psychology and cognitive science to find out how the human\ncognitive apparatus really works; only with that information in hand\ncan the epistemologist construct norms for how humans ought\nto form beliefs (Goldman 1978, 1986). Similarly, moral philosophers\nlike Allan Gibbard and Peter Railton, despite profound substantive\ndisagreements, both think that a satisfactory account of\nmorality\u2019s nature and function must be supported by the results\nof evolutionary biology, our best going theory for how we got to be\nthe way we are (Gibbard 1990; Railton 1986). A philosophical account\nof morality that explains its nature and function in ways that would\nbe impossible according to evolutionary theory would not, by\nnaturalistic scruples, be an acceptable philosophical theory.\n\n\u201cMethods Continuity,\u201d by contrast, demands only that\nphilosophical theories emulate the methods of inquiry of\nsuccessful sciences. \u201cMethods\u201d should be construed broadly\nhere to encompass not only, say, the experimental method, but also the\nstyles of explanation (e.g., identification of causes that determine,\nceteris paribus, their effects) employed in the sciences.\nSuch a view does not presuppose the methodological unity of\nthe various sciences, only that successful sciences have some\nmethodological uniqueness, even if this is not exactly the\nsame across all the sciences. Historically, Methods Continuity has\nconstituted the most important type of naturalism in philosophy; it\nis found in writers like Spinoza, Hume, and Nietzsche. (However,\nunlike the contemporary M-naturalists who draw on the actual\nresults of established sciences, many historical\nM-naturalists drawn to Methods Continuity simply try to\nemulate a scientific way of understanding the world in\ndeveloping their philosophical theories.)\n\nM-naturalists, then, construct philosophical theories that are\ncontinuous with the sciences either in virtue of their dependence upon\nthe actual results of scientific method in different domains or in\nvirtue of their employment and emulation of distinctively scientific\nways of looking at and explaining things. We may still distinguish\nbetween two different branches of M-naturalism, represented best by\nQuine, on the hand, and Goldman, on the other. The former we will call\nReplacement Naturalism, the latter Normative Naturalism.\nGoldman\u2019s paradigm of Normative Naturalism has dominated\nresearch in philosophy (see Kitcher 1992), though it is Quine\u2019s\nnotion of Replacement Naturalism that proves useful for understanding\nthe American Legal Realists as naturalists in legal philosophy (Leiter\n1997). Since both Replacement and Normative Naturalists share the\nmethodological commitment distinctive of naturalism\u2014to\nmake philosophical theorizing continuous with and dependent upon\nscientific theorizing\u2014the difference must be located elsewhere:\nnot in methodology, but in goal. According to Replacement Naturalists,\nthe goal of theorizing is description or explanation; to that end,\nconceptual and justificatory theories are to be replaced by\nempirical and descriptive theories. According to Normative\nNaturalists, the goal is regulation of practice through the\npromulgation of norms or standards. Of course, traditional\nepistemology also shares the regulative goal of Normative Naturalism;\nwhat distinguishes the Normative Naturalist is simply the\nmethods employed to realize this objective (cf. Goldman 1986,\npp. 6\u20139).\n\nMany naturalists go beyond methodological naturalism, however, and\nembrace a substantive doctrine. S-naturalism in philosophy is\neither the (ontological) view that the only things that exist are\nnatural or physical things; or the (semantic) view\nthat a suitable philosophical analysis of any concept must show it to\nbe amenable to empirical inquiry. In the ontological sense,\nS-naturalism is often taken to entail physicalism, the doctrine that\nonly those properties picked out by the laws of the physical sciences\nare real. In the semantic sense, S-naturalism is just the view that\npredicates must be analyzable in terms that admit of empirical\ninquiry: so, e.g., a semantic S-naturalist might claim that\n\u201cmorally good\u201d can be analyzed in terms of characteristics\nlike \u201cmaximizing human well-being\u201d that admit of empirical\ninquiry by psychology and physiology (assuming that well-being is a\ncomplex psycho-physical state).\n\nMany philosophers are drawn to some type of S-naturalism in virtue of\ntheir M-naturalism: being a philosophical naturalist in the\nmethodological sense sometimes leads a philosopher to think that the\nbest philosophical account of some concept or domain will be in terms\nthat are substantively naturalistic. However, it is important to\nnotice that a commitment to Methodological Naturalism does\nnot necessarily entail any substantive conclusions:\nmethodologically, it is an open question whether the best\nphilosophical account of morality or mentality or law must be in\nsubstantively naturalistic terms.\n\nThe varieties of philosophical naturalism map on to a variety of\nnaturalistic approaches in legal philosophy. The most radical version\nof M-naturalism, Replacement Naturalism, has been articulated and\ndefended by Leiter (2001b) and arguably by the American\nLegal Realists (Llewellyn 1930; Moore and Callahan 1943; Leiter 1997).\nThe less radical form of M-naturalism, Normative Naturalism, is\nexemplified in epistemology by Goldman (1978, 1986), but its\nimplications for jurisprudence and law have been, to date, only partly\ndeveloped (Allen & Leiter 2001; Goldman 1999; Leiter 1998; Talbott\n& Goldman 1998). S-naturalism features most prominently in the\nwritings of the Scandinavian Legal Realists. S-naturalism has also\nplayed a role in motivating Legal Positivism in the Anglo-American\nlegal-philosophical tradition. More recently, S-naturalism without\nnormative skepticism has been defended by contemporary moral realists\nand natural law theorists like Brink (1988, 1989, 2001) and Moore\n(1985, 1992b).\n",
