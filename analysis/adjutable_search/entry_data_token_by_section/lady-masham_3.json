    "main_text": "Occasional Thoughts\n4. Correspondence\n\nDamaris Masham\u2019s correspondence is important for the insight it\ngives into her philosophical interests. It is not a perfect source, as\nit is far from complete. She herself preferred what she called\n\u201crationall conversation\u201d as a medium for philosophical\ndiscussion. After Locke\u2019s arrival at Oates, she was able to\nengage in person with visitors from Locke\u2019s otherwise male\nsocial world of friends and associates, such as his nephew Peter King,\nAnthony Collins, John Shute (later Viscount Barrington), Francis\nMercury van Helmont, Samuel Bolde, Lord Shaftesbury, Lord Peterborough\nand Isaac Newton. Among these, Pierre Coste was engaged as tutor to\nher son.  Prior to this, letter-writing enabled her to engage with\nothers beyond her domestic environment. Letters also mitigated her\nisolation from company at Oates after her marriage. Subsequently, the\nreview of her Discourse in Jean Le\nClerc\u2019s Bibliotheque Choisie, was confirmation that she\nacquired a place of sorts in the international intellectual network\nknown as the \u2018Republic of Letters\u2019, which was centred on\nHuguenot diaspora in the Netherlands. Her international correspondents\nfrom this network besides Jean Le Clerc included Philip van Limborch\nand Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\n\nDamaris Masham\u2019s extant correspondence indicates a lively interest\nin a range of topics, such as friendship and religious toleration. The\nmost philosophically important letters were those she exchanged with\nLocke and Leibniz. \n\nThe correspondence with Locke, conducted between 1682 and Locke\u2019s\ntaking up residence at Oates, is the largest extant group of letters\n(some 45 letters survive). Most of Locke\u2019s letters to her have\nbeen lost and many of the letters are of a personal nature. But themes\ninclude proof of the existence of God and the role of reason in\nmatters of religion. Early on she defends the epistemology of the\nCambridge Platonist, John Smith, arguing that there is a\nsupra-rational/elevated form of knowledge accessible by a\n\u2018Higher Principle\u2019 than reason, which may nonetheless be\nactivated with the help of reason. Locke however, dismissed this as a\nform of \u2018Enthusiasm\u2019. Later she commented on the Epitome of\nLocke\u2019s Essay which he sent her in 1688. \n\nBetween 1704 and 1705\u20136, Lady Masham corresponded with Leibniz, at his\ninstigation, perhaps because he hoped thereby, to have contact with\nLocke. This gave her the opportunity to discuss Leibniz\u2019s philosophy\nwith him, and for Leibniz to discuss the philosophy of her father,\nRalph Cudworth. Lady Masham knew Leibniz\u2019s philosophy only\nindirectly from the Journal des S\u00e7avans of 1695, and\nBayle\u2019s article \u201cRorarius\u201d in the first edition of\nhis Dictionnaire. She takes issue with Leibniz on a number of\npoints, including his theory of pre-established harmony, the nature of\nsubstance and free will.\n\nHer correspondence with Jean Le Clerc gives some insight into her\nviews on religious toleration. It also includes her defence of her\nfather\u2019s True Intellectual System of the Universe\nagainst the critique of Cudworth by Pierre Bayle, a controversy which\nwas conducted by proxy through Jean Le Clerc. This is revealing in a\nnumber of ways. It shows she was willing to disagree with Cudworth (e.g., on\nthe question of whether there could be such a thing as unextended\nsubstance), whilst retaining her respect for him and being prepared to\ndefend him against his detractors (in this case Pierre Bayle). It also\nindicates that she had not abandoned all the Platonist tenets to which\nshe subscribed before she met Locke.\n\n",
