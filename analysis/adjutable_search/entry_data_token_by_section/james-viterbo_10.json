    "main_text": "Cognition\n6. Cognition\n\nJames\u2019 longest discussion of cognition occurs in question 12 of\nhis first Quodlibet, which asks whether it is necessary to posit an\nagent intellect in the human soul that is distinct from the possible\nintellect (for discussion see C\u00f4t\u00e9 2013, and\nSol\u00e8re 2018a and 2018b). Since the view that there is such a\ndistinction was an important component of abstraction theories of\nknowledge, what was really at stake was whether abstraction theory\nprovided the correct account of knowledge acquisition. According to\nabstraction theory, of which Aquinas was one of the most famous\nexponents, the mind derives its content from an engagement with\nsense-images (phantasms). The agent intellect, a \u201cpart\u201d of\nthe intellectual soul, was held to abstract intelligible species from\nthe sense-images, and these species were then \u201creceived\u201d\nby the possible intellect. Since the same power could not be both\nactive and passive, the two intellects had to be distinct. As can be\ngathered from the preceding section, James would not be favorably\ndisposed to such a theory. Since intelligibles, for him, preexisted in\nthe soul in the form of \u201captitudes\u201d or\n\u201cfitnesses,\u201d there was no need for them to be abstracted;\nand since the main reason for positing an agent intellect was to\nperform abstraction, there was no reason to suppose that such a\nfaculty existed \u2014 which is exactly the position he defended in\nquestion 12. James\u2019 theory of innate  idoneitates in\nthe soul thus entailed a wholesale rejection of abstraction theories\nof knowledge and of the model of the soul on which they rested\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9 2013). \n\nJames was well aware that by denying the distinction between the two\nintellects, he was opposing the consensus view of Aristotle\ncommentators. Indeed, his views seem to run counter to the De\nanima itself, though, as he would mischievously point out, it was\ndifficult to determine just what Aristotle\u2019s doctrine was, so\nobscure was its formulation (Quodl. I, q. 12, p. 169,\n426\u2014170, 439). He explained that what he was denying was not\nthat there was a \u201cdifference\u201d in the intellect\u2014the\nsoul\u2019s powers did exhibit such a difference since they were both\nactive and passive\u2014rather, what he was denying was that\u2019s the\nexistence of a difference implied a real distinction of powers\n(Quodl. I, q. 12, p. 170, 440\u201345).\n\nAs far as James was concerned the relevant question was not how\nintelligibles are abstracted so as to produce occurrent acts of\ncognition, but rather how innate intellectual aptitudes can develop\ninto occurrent acts of cognition. The key to his solution lay in his\nview that aptitudes actively tend toward their completion. James\ndescribed such active inclination as a kind of\nself-motion\u2014formal self-motion\u2013which he viewed as\nthe main created causal contributor to a power\u2019s actualization.\nBut of course \u201cmain causal contributor\u201d does not mean\n\u201csole causal contributor.;\u201d Although the soul\u2019s\npowers stand closer to their actualization and exercise greater formal\nself-motion than do the seminal reasons in matter, and although the\nintellect and its aptitudes likewise stand closer to their\nactualization and exercise greater self-motion than do the senses and\ntheir aptitudes, no \u201cfitness\u201d on its own is sufficient to\nbring about its actualization (Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 102,\n777\u2013778; something further is required. In the case of the\nsenses, what is required is the \u201cexcitative\u201d causality\n(excitatio) exercised by the physical change in the organ of\nsense; in the case of the intellect, it is the excitative causality\nsupplied by the phantasm. In both cases, James held that the\npower\u2019s formal self-motion together with the\n\u201crousing\u201d action stemming from the organ or the phantasm\nnecessarily entailed their effect.\n\nJames of Viterbo is thus part of a group of thinkers in the history of\nphilosophy for whom the intellect itself, as opposed to extra-mental\nobjects or their proxies in the soul, is the main causal factor not\nonly of the production of acts of knowledge but of their conceptual\ncontent as well. Indeed, for James, that content is already present in\nthe soul in the form of general and specific \u201cfitnesses\u201d\nor \u201captitudes.\u201d The aptitudes are innate (naturaliter\ninditae, \u201calways present in [the soul]\u201d\n(Quodl. I, q. 7, p. 92, 422\u2013423), ready to be\nactualized in the presence of the appropriate triggering factors. Few\nother scholastics were ready to espouse such an extreme form of\ninnatism, which some scholars have likened to the theory innate ideas\nof the Early Moderns (Sol\u00e8re 2018a).\n",
