    "main_text": "Sociobiology as Behavioral Ecology\n1. Sociobiology as Behavioral Ecology\n\nThe first meaning of \u201csociobiology\u201d is a term for a range\nof work that is more often currently referred to as behavioral\necology. Behavioral ecology is a science that uses evolutionary\ntheory and especially adaptationist methods to try to understand\nanimal behavior. Consider, for example the female parasitic jewel\nwasp. This wasp lives and lays its eggs in blowfly pupae; after a\nfemale wasp of this species is born and reaches adulthood she mates\nwith one of the males also occupying her pupa, and then emerges and\nflies off to lay her eggs in another pupa. The jewel wasp is\nhaplodiploid, and females can control the sex of each of their\noffspring by controlling whether or not the egg is fertilized when she\nlays it. What is particularly interesting about this wasp is that the\npercentage of females to males she lays depends on whether she got to\nthe pupa first. If she is first to the pupa she lays a number of eggs,\nwith mostly females (about 91.3%) and some males (about 8.7%).\nHowever, if she lays eggs in a pupa after another female has been\nthere (this is called superparasitism), she lays a lot more\nsons than daughters. Behavioral ecologists are interested in\nunderstanding why animal behaviors like this have the peculiar\nfeatures they do.\n\nBehavioral ecology is sometimes characterized in terms of its\nrelationships to the earlier \u201cethology\u201d whose most famous\npractitioners are probably Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. Tinbergen\n(1963) famously described four types of questions that an ethologist\nmight ask in trying to understand some pattern of animal behavior,\nsuch as the egg laying strategy of the jewel wasp above. First, the\nethologist could ask questions about the proximate causes of\nthe behavior: for example, what neurological or psychological\nmechanisms lead the wasp to lay her eggs in the pattern she does? What\nmechanisms are responsible for the development of that\nmechanism\u2014what developmental processes build the neural tissue\nthat directly causes the egg laying behavior? Second, the ethologist\ncould ask two ultimate, evolutionary questions about the behavior:\nwhat is the evolutionary function of the behavior, i.e. how\ndoes laying eggs in that pattern contribute to the wasp\u2019s\nreproductive success, to the reproductive success of its ancestors,\nand hence to the behavior\u2019s history of evolution by natural\nselection (if that is its history) in the jewel wasp population? Also,\nwhat is the phylogeny of the behavior, i.e. where did it\narise in the evolutionary tree of the jewel wasp?\n\nUnlike ethologists, behavioral ecologists studying animal behavior at\nfirst tended to focus on the third question, the question of\nevolutionary function, at the expense of the others (Griffiths, 2008;\nKrebs and Davies, 1997). Griffiths (2008) has argued such a focus by\nthe behavioral ecologists on questions of function at the expense of\nquestions of causation, development and phylogeny (but especially\ndevelopment) was highly problematic, since the four questions cannot\nbe properly answered independently. Development constrains the\nevolution of biological traits in multiple ways, and behavior\nespecially, since behavior depends on development at both neurological\nand psychological levels. Behavioral ecologists, however, for a long\ntime took the complexity of the developmental resources contributing\nto behavior as a reason for (at least temporarily) avoiding such\nstudies as part of their study of the evolution of behavior. Grafen\n(1984) argues that the problem with developmental approaches to\nbehavior is that they are hard and lengthy to perform, especially if\nthe only or primary purpose of the developmental\nwork is to check that the trait in question does indeed have an\nevolutionary history that can be understood using adaptationist\nmethods. Grafen argues that if behavioral ecologists had to perform\ndevelopmental or psychological studies to be relatively confident of\ntheir conclusions about the evolutionary history of traits, they would\nprobably never get as far as evolutionary studies, since such\ndevelopmental and genetic work would take a very long time. Worse,\nsuch studies might well have no inherent interest of their own and\nrepresent a waste of time and resources for the scientist\u2014not\nall traits have an interesting or enlightening developmental\nbackground or are produced by interesting and unknown psychological\nmechanisms. Instead, Grafen argues that behavioral ecologists should\nuse what he calls the \u201cphenotypic gambit\u201d in studying the\nevolution of behavioral traits. This involves assuming that the\ndevelopmental, psychological and genetic proximate causes of a\nbehavioral trait, such as the jewel wasp\u2019s egg-laying strategy\nare of a type that will permit scientists to \u201cpretend\u201d\nthat they are very straightforward when building evolutionary models,\nand yet still end up with models that give approximately the right\nanswers about the primary processes, conditions and constraints acting\non that trait during its evolution (for another similar view see\nMaynard Smith, 1982, 6ff).\n\nSince Grafen wrote his article, however, there has been a certain\nshift in non-human behavioral ecology away from the phenotypic gambit\nand in favor of paying attention to proximate mechanisms, not simply\nbecause these enlighten whether a behavioral strategy could evolve by\nnatural selection in any particular case, but also the nature of the\nfitness costs and benefits that accrue to an organism sometimes depend\non how the adaptive problem they face is solved. For example, Lotem et\nal. (1995) appeal to the type of learning mechanism used by parenting\ngreat reed warblers to detect the presence of cuckoos in their nests:\nthis limits how reliable their detection of cuckoo eggs can be.\nSimilarly, Shuker and West (2004) argue that the constraints on the\negg laying strategy of the parasitic jewel wasp cannot be properly\nunderstood without paying attention to the limits on the detection\nmechanisms the wasp uses to determine the presence or absence of\nother females, versus other females\u2019 eggs in\neach area.\n\nPerhaps the most important analytical tool of the behavioral ecologist\nis the optimality model (Maynard Smith, 1978): however,\nfrequency dependent models, which do not assume population fixation of\na trait, such as evolutionary stable strategy models (Maynard Smith,\n1982) (see also the entry on\n evolutionary game theory)\n and dynamic models, such those employed in studying life history\ntraits (Roff, 1992), are also used. Optimality models are designed to\nshow which of a set of possible variant behavioral strategies would\nmaximize a local fitness\n currency[2]\n under a range of ecological conditions and constraints implicitly or\nexplicitly represented in the mathematical structure of the model.\nThese conditions are supposed to represent the selection\nconditions of the trait (the conditions responsible for driving\nits evolution by natural selection \u2013 Brandon, 1990); however,\nthey are usually derived by observing the conditions under which the\norganism is currently living, since these are assumed generally to\nhave remained much the same as the conditions under which the organism\nevolved (Turke, 1990). Werren (1980) provided just such a model for\nthe jewel wasp above; the model suggests that the reason for the\nchange in the ratio of sons to daughters when a female wasp finds an\noccupied pupa is due to the potential opportunity to mate with the\ndaughters of the first wasp. If only the first wasp lays her eggs on\nthe pupa, then the hatching daughters mate with their brothers and all\ntheir offspring are entirely descendants of the first wasp. This means\nthe first wasp needs to produce very few sons\u2014only enough to\nmate with all the females; the second generation reproductive success\nof the first wasp is maximized by maximizing the number of daughters.\nHowever, where there is a superparasitic wasp, the superparasitic\nwasp\u2019s sons can mate with the large numbers of daughters of the\nfirst wasp. The superparasitic wasp needs to maximize the number of\nthe females in the pupa that breed with her sons as opposed to their\nbrothers, whilst at the same time limiting the amount of competition\namongst her sons. So if she has only a few eggs to lay, it makes sense\nfor her to lay almost all sons; as brood sizes grow larger, it makes\nsense to gradually increase the proportion of daughters in the mix.\nWerren calculated the optimal percentages of males and females for\neach brood size. His observations of male to female ratios fit the\npredictions of this model quite well but not perfectly.\n\nThere is some debate among various philosophers and behavioral\necologists about what exactly optimality models like Werren\u2019s\nare being used to demonstrate. Orzack and Sober (1994) claim that\nbehavioral ecologists like Werren use optimality models to demonstrate\nthat the traits in question are adaptations, i.e. that the traits have\nevolved by natural selection. Furthermore, Orzack and Sober take\noptimality models to be censored models, that is, they are\ndesigned to determine the outcome of natural selection in a population\nwhere natural selection is the only important force, and hence show,\ngiven the model correctly predicts the observed features of the trait\nbeing studied, that natural selection was the most important force in\nits\n evolution[3].\n The idea then, is that the relative success of Werren\u2019s model\nis supposed to demonstrate that natural selection was the most\nimportant force in the evolution of the jewel wasp\u2019s egg-laying\nstrategy\u2014other forces may have been involved, but they are not\nas causally important. However, various other philosophers have argued\nthat such models do not make such strongly adaptationist assumptions;\nPotochnik (2009), for example, argues that optimality models are only\ndesigned to show the general role that natural selection and other\nforces (such as developmental constraints) are playing, and are not\ndesigned to test strong adaptationist hypotheses about the behavioral\nstrategies in question\u2014i.e. in our case above, the success of\nthe model is intended to show that natural selection was acting on the\njewel wasp\u2019s strategy, and that the way it was acting\non the jewel wasp\u2019s strategy was via the effects of competition\nbetween the male wasps in the pupa, the variations in brood size and\nthe other conditions and constraints to which Werren\u2019s model\nappeals. The success of the model is not intended to show\nthat natural selection was the only important force involved in the\nevolution of the jewel wasp\u2019s strategy. For other criticisms of\nthe censored model view, see Rice (2012) and Bolduc and Cezilly\n(2012).\n\nHowever, interestingly, some behavioral ecologists have claimed that\nthey do not use optimality models to test whether or not natural\nselection is acting on a trait, but instead assume the operation of\nnatural selection in order to test hypotheses about the conditions and\nconstraints acting on the trait (Parker and Maynard Smith, 1990). This\ncould be problematic, if it means behavioral ecologists baldly accept\nthe view that natural selection optimizes most traits and never\nproperly test this claim. However, one interpretation of Parker and\nMaynard Smith (1990) is not that behavioral ecologists have an\nunfalsifiable commitment to the idea that natural selection is an\noptimizer. Instead, they are claiming that testing hypotheses about\nthe operation of natural selection itself is not what the behavioral\necologists are focusing on. The behavioral ecologists are making the\npreliminary assumption that a trait is an adaptation in order to test\nother hypotheses about it\u2014they \u201cpretend as if\u201d the\ntrait were an adaptation, and use that assumption to detect\ndeviations from optimality that might reveal interesting\ntradeoffs and constraints\u2014the nature of the deviation can\nsuggest what might be missing from the model. This of course has the\nupshot that when the models initially fail, the scientists do not look\nfor alternative non-adaptationist hypotheses, but instead\ninitially look for new constraints, tradeoffs and conditions\nunder which selection might be operating. For example, Giraldeau\n(1997) describes deviations from optimality in the evolution of\nphotopigments in the rods (as opposed to cones) in the retinas of fish\nthat live in certain sorts of marine environments where a shift in\nphotosensitivity would be useful; Giraldeau uses this deviation to\nsuggest the presence of a molecular constraint on the evolution of the\nrod cells. Presumably, repeated failures to find ways to fill in the\ngaps in these optimality models could ultimately result in the\nscientists concerned considering alternative, non-adaptationist\nexplanations. So in order for the behavioral ecologists do this work\nthey do not need to be committed to the strong view that natural\nselection is always the most important force in the origin of traits;\nthis heuristic requires at most the view that natural selection\nusually locally optimizes (i.e. optimizes only relative to\npossibly severe constraints).\n\nHowever, another way to understand how the behavioral ecologists are\nusing optimality models, one that is not so often considered, is that\nthey are interested in providing a functional description of\nthe traits they are studying (Kitcher, 1987; see also Bolduc and\nCezilly, 2012, for a similar view in terms of decision patterns rather\nthan behavioral strategies). One of the things that may concern a\nbehavioral ecologist is how exactly to describe the nature of the\nbehavior that they are considering: what component behavioral\ndispositions (from among all of the organism\u2019s behavior) make up\neach strategy, and how those dispositions hang together as an\nadaptation. They need to give a description of the relationship\nbetween the organism\u2019s behavior and its environment, and how it\ncontributes to the organism\u2019s fitness. In the jewel wasp case,\nthe behavioral ecologists have observed the wasps lay different egg\nsex ratios on different occasions. The question is how to make sense\nof these different sex-ratio laying behaviors: the guess is that these\ndifferent behaviors hang together somehow, as manifestations of a\nparticular egg-sex-ratio adjusting strategy; and that having this\nparticular strategy, this particular pattern of egg-sex-ratio laying\nbehavior, does something for the female wasp when considered\nas a whole. But why should a behavioral ecologist accept that any\nparticular such a functional description is true?\n\nAn optimality model can allow a behavioral ecologist to find and test\nsuch a functional description in two ways. First, an optimality model\n(explicitly or implicitly) includes a strategy set, which is\na set of descriptions of possible behavioral strategies; the model\npicks out one of these strategy descriptions as the one that is\nmaximally adaptive. On Werren\u2019s model, the strategy set would be\nan (implicit) set of descriptions of the range of possible sex-ratio\nadjusting strategies that a jewel wasp could use (i.e. each strategy\ninvolves a different set of choices about sex ratios in a full\nrange of relevant conditions like parasitism, superparasitism and\ndifferent brood sizes). The idea is that an optimality model can pick\nout which member of this set is a description of the maximally\nadaptive strategy \u2013 on this view of what the behavioral\necologists are doing, Werren\u2019s model is designed to pick out the\noptimal sex ratio egg laying strategy description from the strategy\nset. The hypothesis is that this description of the maximally\nadaptive strategy will be the correct description of\nwhat the wasp is doing. If it is the correct description, then Werren\ncan now predict what son/daughter ratios he should see the wasp lay in\ncases so far unobserved. These predictions allow him to test if the\ndescription is correct \u2013 if these predictions are true, then on\nthis view, Werren has confirmed that the description of the particular\nsex-ratio adjusting strategy derived from his model is the correct\ndescription of what the wasp is doing.\n\nSecond, the description of the strategy picked out by the model is not\nsimply a description of it as a series of behavioral dispositions\n(i.e. dispositions to lay different sex ratios under different\nconditions), but of the relationships between those dispositions and\nvarious ecological features that determine the fitness of those\ndispositions. For example, in the jewel wasp case, the presence of\nother female competitors, flexibility in brood size, the capacity of\nsons to mate multiple times, the impossibility of migration of sons\nbetween pupae and so on, are features of the environment that\ndetermine whether any potential egg laying strategy of the jewel wasp\nis maximally adaptive, and a well confirmed optimality model can show\nhow. Consequently, contingent on obtaining the appropriate evidence\nthat this is the correct model, the description of the strategy given\nby a successful model is (implicitly or explicitly) a\nfunctional description of the strategy\u2014a description of\nhow the behavior contributes to the fitness of the organism.
