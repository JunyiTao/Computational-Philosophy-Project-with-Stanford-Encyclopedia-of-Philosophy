    "main_text": "Ethical Philosophy || Investigating Things for Ethical Discernment and Practice\n3.1 Investigating Things for Ethical Discernment and Practice\n\nThroughout his career, Zhu Xi focused on the twin problems of 1)\ndetermining the conditions of moral agency, and 2) setting forth a\nviable program of moral self-cultivation on that basis. Zhu saw moral\nagency as the expression of a moral will, which he understood to be\nthe achievement of an inner self-mastery (zhuzai) that forms\nthe core of a person\u2019s moral character, perceptivity,\ncognizance, and responsiveness. On this view, self-cultivation that is\naimed at nurturing self-mastery must include forming a concentrated,\nreverential mind-set (jing) and a discerning sense of\nappropriateness. Early on, Zhu had emphasized the need to attain a\nworking knowledge of the constitutive patterning (li) of\nreality and society in the light of which the norms and ritual action\n(li) prescribed for proper interpersonal relationships and\nintercourse are devised. He later found that establishing the\ndetermination (lizhi) to seek self-realization and conduct\noneself appropriately counted for as much as the long-term cultivation\nprocess itself, during which one can lose sight of one\u2019s purpose\nand be side-tracked (see Qian Mu 1986: 123\u2013127). Moreover, while\nstill maintaining the importance of the norms and ritual action for\ncharacter-building and the social order, Zhu began to emphasize the\nneed to build up a sympathetic but realistic grasp of the warp and\nwoof of real daily human life viewed in the perspective of such broad\nConfucian ethical ideals as humaneness (ren) and fairness\n(gong). He understood that, although the norms and ritual\naction are broadly applicable and reliable, many situations call for\nspecifically tailored\n responses.[4]\n\nConsequently, against the moral intuitionism prevalent at the time in\nNeo-Confucianism, as espoused by his teacher Li Tong\n(1093\u20131163), his intellectual rival Lu Jiuyuan\n(1139\u20131193), and others, Zhu argued that intuitionism is\ninadequate for dealing effectively with the complex human affairs that\npeople are apt to encounter in their\n lives.[5]\n Rather, he advocated dedicating oneself to the observation and study\nof the patterning/patterns (li) of relationship, interaction,\nand change among all things, among human beings in particular. He\nregarded \u201cinvestigating things to extend knowledge\u201d as the\nsurest way to deepen and broaden one\u2019s discernment of the\npatterns that constitute the lived-world. Such knowledge, importantly,\nwould sharpen one\u2019s sense of appropriateness by attuning oneself\nto the actual, subtle, distinguishing features of particular\nsituations.\n\nAgain, Zhu Xi conceived the world as a patterned (li)\ntotality made up of a cosmic vapor (qi) that under various\nconditions condenses and solidifies into countless permutations, from\nthe purest transparent yuanqi (primordial qi), to\nthe Yin-Yang poles modulated by the primal taiji\n(supreme polarity) pattern, to the wuxing (five phases), each\nof which bears an identifying inner pattern and set of propensities\n(xing) that involve interconvertability and recombination\nwith the other four phases, and finally to the phenomenal world:\nHeaven, Earth, and the myriad things (tiandi\n wanwu).[6]\n\n\nFor Zhu Xi, the world presents a vital tapestry of relationships,\ncycles, processes, events, and things that are spontaneously arrayed\nin aesthetic order. In the nexus of these arrays, li are\nmanifested three dimensionally and present different faces from\ndifferent angles (Graham 1986a: 148; Qian Mu 1986: 133). Li\nare inherently perspectival. Zhu adopts metaphors of the grains in\nwood, the lines in jade, the \u201cveins\u201d in a leaf, the lines\nin marble, and even the sinewy texture of beef, to stress that li\nare manifested immanently rather than abstractly, and thus are to be\nsought concretely by observing phenomena in the world, not by pure,\ndisengaged, abstract ratiocination (Needham 1956a: 473). Moreover,\nli are never presented in their putative optimal pure form.\nThey always appear conditioned by the degree of purity of the\nqi through which they are manifested and of the environing\nconditions (Wade 2003).\n\nLi also structure the human mind, thought, and language, such\nthat human beings are predisposed to grasp and attempt to respond\nappropriately to the things and situations they\n encounter.[7]\n Objective learning on this view can be understood as a facet of\nself-learning: indeed, by the principle of continuity, objective\nunderstanding enhances self-understanding, for by comprehending the\nwarp and woof of the outer li of things, one gains insight\ninto the inner li constituting one\u2019s mind and character\n(Qian Mu 1971: II 31\u201338). For Zhu Xi, while li\nstructure the mind, thought, and language, this is not just at the\ncognitive level: li also structure the inner patterning\n(xing) and basic impulses that predispose us to have\ncharacteristically human emotions (qing), relationships, and\nresponses (ganying) under various sets of conditions (Graham\n1986a: 152\u2013154; Qian Mu 1971: II. 25\u201330). In Zhu\u2019s\nConfucian view, li and xing predispose one to be\nsensitive and responsive; metaphorically, they provide the hardware of\nhuman nature. Self-cultivation and moral reflection are the means by\nwhich one actively conditions and fine-tunes these predispositions of\nsensitivity and response. They thus function as indispensable software\nfor cultivating personhood. \n\nThese are the contours of Zhu Xi\u2019s approach to moral\nself-cultivation and interpersonal ethics. The standard ethical norms\nwork well in standard situations, normal families, good communities,\nand ordinary social circumstances. But, Zhu also understood that\npeople are richly complicated and that human affairs often become\ncomplex, get out of hand, and go awry. Life is just not that ideal,\nnot that simple. We sometimes encounter ethically anomalous situations\nto which the standard sets of feelings and responses as prescribed by\nthe received norms and ritual actions simply do not fit. In many\ninstances, standing on the norm and being moralistic simply would make\nmatters worse. Zhu himself said that one must have ample experience\nand self-cultivation so that,\n\n\nIf, by chance, an anomalous affair should come up, one could\ncomprehend it. One wants to be in a position to grasp such affairs\nthoroughly in order to understand their unfamiliar aspects. (YL: ch.\n19)\n\n\nZhu Xi considered how to tailor responses appropriate in problematic\nsituations under the rubric of quan (weighing things up,\ndiscretion, expedient\n means).[8]\n He noted several kinds of situations in which recourse to discretion\nand expedient means might be advisable: 1) extraordinary situations\nthat cannot be covered by the standard norms and ritual actions, 2)\nurgent situations that require a direct violation of the received\nnorms and ritual actions to be satisfactorily resolved, and 3)\nsituations in which it would be more humane and prudent not to observe the relevant\nnorms and ritual actions (see Wei 1986). Situations of the first kind\ninclude those that call for a disruption of the given human order, for\nexample the removal of an evil authority figure, such as a psychotic\nparent or a sociopathic tyrant. For situations of the second kind, Zhu had\nin mind emergencies when one would have to violate a norm in order to\nperform an emergency action, such as grasping the hand of a drowning\nsister-in-law, or shoving an old lady out of the path of a runaway\n oxcart.[9]\n Finally, the third kind of situation includes those in which it would\nbe more compassionate to waive or overlook the ritual prescriptions,\nsuch as in cases of condoning the remarriage of a widow who would\notherwise be destined to isolation and destitution.\n\nClearly, such considerations lead us into unmapped ethical terrain.\nHow far can one justifiably take such sidestepping of the received\napplicable norms and ritual actions? What qualifications and\nrestrictions might apply? For his part, Zhu Xi mentioned at least two\nqualifications: a weak qualification that the expedient adopted not be\notherwise ethically objectionable, and a stronger qualification\nstipulating that the expedient adopted be in compliance with the Way,\ni.e., that it satisfy some basic moral value, at least as basic as the\nvalues expressed in the relevant received norm and ritual action.\nThus, any exercise of discretion that is undertaken in light of\none\u2019s sense of appropriateness (yi), if exercised with\nsufficient probity and care, should satisfy the moral values embodied\nin the Way more adequately than would a routine observance of the\nstandard norm. Humaneness is the core moral value that was invoked\nmost often in such cases, but there are a number of others: filial\npiety, fraternity, fidelity, empathy, compassion, appropriateness,\netc. Famous examples from the Confucian tradition include\nMencius\u2019 reminder that one should overturn the propriety of not\ngrasping the hand of a member of the opposite sex in order to rescue a\ndrowning sister in law (Mencius 4A.17), and Cheng Yi argued\nfor an exception to the impropriety of widows remarrying on the basis\nof filial piety (Rosenlee 2006: 134). Similarly, Socrates showed that\nJustice is not always realized by observance of the proprieties of\ntruth-telling and faithfully returning a friend\u2019s property\n(Plato Republic 331c).\n\nNonetheless, ever cognizant of temptation and moral weakness, Zhu\ninsisted on the well established probity and integrity of anyone who\nwould venture to use discretion and exercise expedient means. He\nstated:\n\n\nIntending to weigh up a situation carefully [in order to exercise\nexpedient means], one must have cultivated the inner root daily, so\nthat one\u2019s mind is sensitive, perspicacious, pure, and\nintegrated; [even in that case,] one still must naturally weigh up\nsuch situations most carefully. As Cheng Yi (1033\u20131107) said: Be\nreverent in order to straighten oneself within; practice\nappropriateness in order to square situations without. One\u2019s\nsense of appropriateness comprises the moral fiber which one expresses\nthrough sincere ritual action (YL 37, 37:6a, par. 36).\n\n\nOnly those who have extensively \u201cinvestigated things to extend\nknowledge\u201d, and who are conversant with the subtle patternings\nof the human heart and human affairs would be qualified to consider\nexercising expedient means over simply following the norms. (Zhu knew\nthat this ethical knowledge is as much a matter of practical\nexperience as of book learning. At times, he told his occasionally\npriggish students that well-disposed people, even if morally\nuntutored, can be more discerning and have better discretion than are\nsome academicians!)\n\nWhile Zhu stressed making careful observations in situations in order\nto tailor the most fitting responses in context, at the same time he\nenvisioned a cultivation process whereby one discerns ever more\nfundamental and yet far-reaching patterns (li) that shape\nnature and moral value. That is, Zhu sometimes construed the project\nof investigating things to extend knowledge as an ascendant movement\nwhereby the learner finally arrives at the\npinnacle\u2014taiji (supreme polarity) that embraces and\nsubsumes all derived patterns. To Zhu, grasping taiji in this\nsense was tantamount to grasping the master key, for it represented to\nhim the apex of being and value, and bestowed realization and sagehood\non those who sincerely and authentically comprehended and embraced\n it.[10]\n While this conception charts an ideal path to the pure, compassionate\nmind-set of sagehood, it obscures Zhu Xi\u2019s usual emphasis on\nfine-tuning and sharpening one\u2019s moral discernment and\nresponsiveness in the midst of things\u2014in full view of the\nsituatedness of people in their daily life. This conception also\nneglects Zhu\u2019s equal emphasis on the claim that patterns as\ninborn propensities (xing) are manifested only in concrete\nspecific qi formations, and thus that 1) patterns are to be\ndiscerned in their fine particularity, that 2) the moral impulses are\nto be nurtured in the stream of human life, and that 3) the emotions,\nwhen not obscured by desires or obsessions, for the most part are\nimmediate expressions of the basic natural impulses.\n\nHow, too, to square this broad vision of probing inquiry and deep\nunderstanding with the potentially constrictive Confucian moral\npsychology constructed tightly round the virtues of humaneness,\nappropriateness, ritual propriety, and wisdom, and their attendant\nemotions? Zhu Xi likely realized that these virtues functioned as\nthematic foci for cultivation as one establishes ones moral\norientation and bearings and a balanced interpersonal stance. One\nneeds to go through an initial stage of mastering these basic virtues\nin order to 1) reinforce one\u2019s altruistic impulses and curtail\nthe egoistic ones, 2) be inclined to seek principled rapport and\nharmony in interpersonal affairs, and 3) be moved by a sense of\noneness with others and all things. Subsequently, the more ethical\nhuman phenomena one observes and considers in advanced level learning\nand cultivation, the more one feels a broad sympathy for others that\ntranscends the narrowly-graded love, the so-called love with\ndistinctions that is attributed to the notion of ren\n(humaneness) in Confucianism (see Mencius, 1A.7, 3A.5, and\n7A.45). The more one observes the nuances of human affairs and the\nsprings of human action, the more one will express deference and\nrespect in ways that do not necessarily coincide exactly with the\ngeneral prescriptions of the norms and ritual actions. In this way,\none will build up a repertoire of conduct that reflects one\u2019s\npersonal ethical discernment and discretion, which expresses\none\u2019s personal ethical attainment and style.\n\nZhu Xi on occasion modeled his ethical conception of observing\nsituations and fashioning the most appropriate response\nnaturalistically on the butcher character, Cook Ding, portrayed in the\nZhuangzi as a skilled artisan: just as the sure blade of Cook\nDing\u2019s cleaver goes straight to the cartilage between the bones,\nthe cultivated sense of appropriateness (yi) of Zhu\nXi\u2019s moral adept strikes right at the heart of interpersonal\nsituations (see Thompson 1988: 39\u201340). A.C. Graham once\ncontrasted Zhu\u2019s perception/response model (gan-ying)\nof ethical action with that of Zhuangzi by suggesting that Zhu\u2019s\nnotion of appropriate response was informed by rigorous adherence to\nrules and principles, whereas Zhuangzi\u2019s was relatively\nintuitive and spontaneous (Graham 1986a: 143\u2013145). This apparent\ncontrast can be resolved by separating the stages of cultivation and\nmastery: Zhuangzi\u2019s skilled artisans, such as Butcher Ding, all\nhad to undergo prolonged periods of rigorously controlled\napprenticeship before they could \u201cforget\u201d the\n\u201cknowing that\u201d in an integrated, spontaneous process of\n\u201cknowing how\u201d. For his part, Zhu Xi knew that the years of\nlearning and practice\u2014one\u2019s moral\napprenticeship\u2014culminates in a responsive moral agent who can\noperate as intuitively and spontaneously in his or her personal and\nsocial ethical sphere as do Zhuangzi\u2019s skilled artisans in\n theirs.[11]\n Zhu\u2019s moral adept is in effect an artisan of interpersonal\nintercourse. Zhu could rightfully claim Confucius as a prime model for\nthis view. After decades of cultivation, Confucius could say,\n\u201cAt sixty, my ear was attuned. At seventy, I could give my heart\nfree rein and without overstepping the mark\u201d (Analects\n2.4).\n\nViewed as a quest for knowledge as responsive pattern (li)\ndiscernment, enhanced by association, analogical reasoning, and\ngeneralization, Zhu Xi\u2019s approach to inquiry dovetails with\nrecent studies on strategies for learning for effective, ethical\nliving. Neuroscientist and gerontologist Daniel J. Levitin writes\nconcerning intelligence and wisdom,\n\nHumans excel at... making associations, taking information... and\nseeing how it interacts with other information. Whenever we encounter\nnew information, our brains place it in a conceptual frame and then\nseek to associate it with other things we have experienced. The brain\nis a giant pattern detector\u2026. Our brains add to that the\nability to form analogies, \u2026 [to perform] analogical\nreasoning. The wisdom we find in older adults follow[s] from \u2026\nthese four things: association, experience, pattern recognition, and\nthe use of analogies. And, this is why we we gain more and more wisdom\nas we age. Wisdom comes from the accumulated sets of things we\u2019ve seen\nand experienced, our ability to detect patterns in those experiences,\nand our ability to predict future outcomes based on them. (And what is\nintelligence if not that?)  Naturally, the more you have experienced,\nthe more wisdom you are able to tap into\u2026. [Old-timers] have\nbeen witness to so many things that seem to cycle around again and\nagain. Wisdom enables you to handle some problems more quickly and\neffectively than the raw firepower of youth. [In sum, m]aking\nassociations underpins learning. To assimilate new information we need\nto associate it with what we\u2019ve seen before. Life experience gives us\nmore associations to make, more patterns (li) to\nrecognize. (Levitin 2020, pp. 119\u2013120)\n\nOn the surface, it appears that while Zhu Xi\u2019s method of inquiry\nis specialized and prescriptive, Levitin\u2019s presentation is\nmerely descriptive of normal human learning. However, Levitin is\ndescribing the optimal learning strategies of people who remain\nsensitive, alert, discerning, and responsive throughout mature life,\ntraits that some people nurture going forward and that others ought to\nmake efforts to cultivate themselves in order to be more vital, understanding, and effective human actors and lead more fulfilling lives.\n\nZhu Xi\u2019s appropriateness approach to ethics has several distinct\nfeatures. First, one is to be well-versed in the received norms and\nrituals that circumscribe interpersonal relationships and prescribe\nproper behavior in family and society. Second, one is to have made\nample observations and responses in real life situations. Third, one\nis to have examined and reflected on ways in which others act and\nrespond in situations, for reference. Fourth, through extensive\nobservation and experience, one is to be cognizant of the range of\nconsiderations that come into play in real life situations: moral\nprinciple, utility, fairness, sympathy, compassion, and so\n forth.[12]\n Fifth, one is to remain flexible and open-minded as well as avoid\nmaking surmises, being insistent, stubborn, or self-centered\n(Analects 9.4). According to this view, while observing the\nethical norms and rules of thumb in his or her community, the moral\nadept possesses a store of personal ethical sensitivity,\nresponsiveness, and resourcefulness, by which to fashion the most\nfitting responses to situations.\n",
