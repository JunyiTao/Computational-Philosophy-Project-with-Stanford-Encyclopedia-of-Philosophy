Key Features of Natural Law Theories\n\nEven though we have already confined \u2018natural law theory\u2019\nto its use as a term that marks off a certain class of ethical\ntheories, we still have a confusing variety of meanings to contend\nwith. Some writers use the term with such a broad meaning that any\nmoral theory that is a version of moral realism \u2014 that is, any\nmoral theory that holds that some positive moral claims are literally\ntrue (for this conception of moral realism, see Sayre-McCord\n1988)\u2014 counts as a natural law view. Some use it so narrowly\nthat no moral theory that is not grounded in a very specific form of\nAristotelian teleology could count as a natural law view. It might be\nthought that there is nothing that can be done to begin a discussion\nof natural law theory in ethics other than to stipulate a meaning for\n\u2018natural law theory\u2019 and to proceed from there. But there\nis a better way of proceeding, one that takes as its starting point\nthe central role that the moral theorizing of Thomas Aquinas plays in\nthe natural law tradition. If any moral theory is a theory of natural\nlaw, it is Aquinas\u2019s. (Every introductory ethics anthology that\nincludes material on natural law theory includes material by or about\nAquinas; every encyclopedia article on natural law thought refers to\nAquinas.)\u00a0 It would seem sensible, then, to take Aquinas\u2019s\nnatural law theory as the central case of a natural law position: of\ntheories that exhibit all of the key features of Aquinas\u2019s\nnatural law view we can say that they are clearly natural law\ntheories; of theories that exhibit few of them we can say that they\nare clearly not natural law theories; and of theories that exhibit\nmany but not all of them we can say that they are in the neighborhood\nof the natural law view but nonetheless must be viewed as at most\ndeviant cases of that position. There remain, no doubt, questions\nabout how we determine what are to count as the key features\nof Aquinas\u2019s position. But we may take as the key features those\ntheses about natural law that structure his overall moral view and\nwhich provide the basis for other theses about the natural law that he\naffirms. \n\nFor Aquinas, there are two key features of the natural law, features\nthe acknowledgment of which structures his discussion of the natural\nlaw at Question 94 of the Prima Secundae of the Summa\nTheologiae. The first is that, when we focus on God\u2019s role\nas the giver of the natural law, the natural law is just one aspect of\ndivine providence; and so the theory of natural law is from that\nperspective just one part among others of the theory of divine\nprovidence. The second is that, when we focus on the human\u2019s\nrole as recipient of the natural law, the natural law constitutes the\nprinciples of practical rationality, those principles by which human\naction is to be judged as reasonable or unreasonable; and so the\ntheory of natural law is from that perspective the preeminent part of\nthe theory of practical rationality.\n",
