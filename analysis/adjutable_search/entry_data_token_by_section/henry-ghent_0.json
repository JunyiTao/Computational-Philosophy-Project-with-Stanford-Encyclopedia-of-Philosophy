Life and Writings\n\n\nIt is not known exactly when Henry was born; his date of birth is\nusually placed before 1240, perhaps between 1217 and 1223, though\nwithout any concrete evidence. Information about his career is also\nscarce. He was in Paris in 1265; from 1267 he begins to appear in the\ndocuments as magister, as well as canon of Tournai, though\nnothing is known of his presumed teaching activity at the Faculty of\nArts. From 1276, the year in which he disputed his first\nQuodlibet, until his death, Henry was Regent Master at the\nFaculty of Theology. Manuscript copies of his second\nQuodlibet, datable to 1277, indicate that he was archdeacon of\nBrugge (Bruges). From 1279 he was archdeacon of Tournai (Doornik). His name was recorded\nin the death register of Tournai cathedral on 23 June 1293.\n\n\nDuring his university career in Paris Henry was personally involved in\nalmost all of the most important events in university and\necclesiastical life. In 1277 he was a member of the commission of\ntheologians set up by Bishop Tempier in order to censure propositions\nconsidered erroneous that were being taught at the Faculty of Arts and\nthat would be condemned on 7 March of the same year (Wielockx\n2011). Nevertheless, not only did Henry affirm on several occasions\nthat he neither understood nor approved of the condemnation of certain\narticles, but he himself was pressured by Tempier and the papal legate\nSimone di Brion to distance himself from the theory of the unicity of\nsubstantial form in man (see below, \u00a711).\n\n\nFrom 1281, the year of the publication of the papal bull Ad\nfructus uberes issued by Pope Martin IV, Henry represented the\nmain theological reference point for the faction of prelates (secular\nclergy) in the clash with the regulars of the Mendicant Orders over the\nquestion of the reiteration of confession; in other words, in the\nprelates\u2019 interpretation, over the obligation for all believers\nto confess to their parish priest, at least once a year, sins already\nconfessed to a friar. Henry would be engaged in this violent\ncontroversy for the rest of his life and it seems that he was even\ntemporarily suspended from teaching for not having heeded the papal\nlegates\u2019 warning not to hold disputes on the interpretation of\nprivileges granted by the pope.\n\n\nThe last great secular master in Paris in the second half of the\n13th century (together with Godfrey of Fontaines), Henry is\nauthor of a monumental, though incomplete, Summa (the part\nDe creaturis is missing altogether, even though it was part\nof the work's overall plan), 15 Quodlibeta, disputed and\npublished while writing the Summa (G\u00f3mez Caffarena\n1957) a short commentary on the Book of Genesis (Lectura\nordinaria super sacram Scripturam), a lengthy treatise on the\nquestion of the privileges of Confession (Tractatus super factum\npraelatorum et fratrum), as well as sermons (on Hernry's written\nlegacy see Wilson 2011b). However, his not strictly theological\nproduction is of uncertain attribution: probably authentic are a\ntreatise on the Syncategoremata (ms.  Brugge, Stadsbibl.,\n510, ff. 227ra-237va) and a commentary in question form on\nthe Physics (ms. Erfurt, Amplon. F. 349), while there is more\ndoubt concerning an incomplete commentary, again in question form, on\nthe Metaphysics (ms. Escorial, h.II.1; different arguments\nare presented in Porro 2002a and Pickav\u00e9 2007).\n",
