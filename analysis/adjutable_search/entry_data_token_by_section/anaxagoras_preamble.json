    "main_text": "\n\n\nAnaxagoras of Clazomenae (a major Greek city of Ionian Asia Minor), a\nGreek philosopher of the 5th century B.C.E. (born ca.\n500\u2013480), was the first of the Presocratic philosophers to live in\nAthens. He propounded a physical theory of\n\u201ceverything-in-everything,\u201d and claimed that\nnous (intellect or mind) was the motive cause of the\ncosmos. He was the first to give a correct explanation of eclipses,\nand was both famous and notorious for his scientific theories,\nincluding the claims that the sun is a mass of red-hot metal, that the\nmoon is earthy, and that the stars are fiery stones. Anaxagoras\nmaintained that the original state of the cosmos was a mixture of all\nits ingredients (the basic realities of his system). The ingredients\nare thoroughly mixed, so that no individual ingredient as such is\nevident, but the mixture is not entirely uniform or\nhomogeneous. Although every ingredient is ubiquitous, some ingredients\nare present in higher concentrations than others, and these\nproportions may also vary from place to place (even if they do not do\nso in the original state of the cosmos). The mixture is unlimited in\nextent, and at some point in time it is set into motion by the action\nof nous (intellect).  The mixture begins to rotate around some\nsmall point within it, and as the whirling motion proceeds and expands\nthrough the mass, the ingredients in the mixture are shifted and separated\nout (in terms of relative density) and remixed with each other,\nultimately producing the cosmos of apparently separate material masses and\nmaterial objects, with the different properties, that we perceive.\n",
