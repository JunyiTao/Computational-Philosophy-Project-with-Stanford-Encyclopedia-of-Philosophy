    "main_text": "Conceptual Issues || What is merit?\n2.1 What is merit?\n\n\u201cMerit\u201d connotes worth, quality, virtue, excellence, and\nmore. If we are to build a society upon merit, as meritocrats desire,\nit seems necessary to understand exactly what merit is. Yet conceptual\nanalysis of merit is nascent (see Clavero Garc\u00eda 2023; Vlastos\n[1962] also offers some comments).\n\nOne thing that is clear is that merit is a contextual phenomenon, as\nAristotle suggested\n (\u00a71).\n We cannot answer the question of whether some person (book, painting,\netc.) is meritorious unless we have a context in mind. If, in the\nmiddle of a discussion about the all-time great baseball players, one\nasks, \u201cwas Albert Einstein meritorious?\u201d, the appropriate\nanswer is \u201cno\u201d. To be sure, we talk about people being\nmeritorious simpliciter. We say things like, \u201cEinstein\nwas a meritorious man\u201d. But in these cases we understand the\ncontext implicitly.\n\nIt is also possible to broadly condemn a person while conceding his\nmerit within a narrow context. One may say that Hitler had merit as an\nartist without making any commitments to his merit in other contexts,\nor to his overall merit.\n\nA crucial conceptual issue is the relationship between merit and its\nreal-world effects. Especially when it comes to governance\n (\u00a73),\n meritocracy is frequently justified by the good outcomes it creates.\nAnd this much seems incontrovertible: All else equal, a meritorious\npolitician will make higher-quality decisions than an unmeritorious\none.\n\nBut this is not necessarily true. Merit, which is internal,\nis distinct from the outcomes which issue from it. The outcomes are\nexternal, although they are sometimes used as evidence of\nmerit. A Nobel Prize in physics is good evidence that Jones is a\nmeritorious physicist. But it is no guarantee: Jones could have stolen\nthe research that won him the Prize, falsely publishing it under his\nown name.\n\nAs Hume puts in the Treatise:\n\n\nThe external performance has no merit. We must look within to find the\nmoral quality. This we cannot do directly; and therefore fix our\nattention on actions, as on external signs. But these actions are\nstill considered as signs; and the ultimate object of our praise and\napprobation is the motive, that produc\u2019d them. (1739\u201340:\n3.2.1)\n\n\nAn example, which we will return to, illustrates the importance of the\nmerit-outcomes distinction. Suppose that Daryl and John are applying\nfor jobs at the widget factory. Daryl is more skilled than John, works\nfaster, is more careful, more collegial, and so on. But this factory\nis filled with racists and Daryl belongs to the disfavored race. As a\nresult, Daryl would perform worse\u2014make fewer widgets per\nhour\u2014than John would. (This is a case of taste\ndiscrimination\u2014Becker 1957.)\n\nObserve that, conceptually, Daryl remains more meritorious than John\neven though hiring John would generate better outcomes. Those who\nsupport hiring John rather than Daryl\u2014utilitarians,\nsay\u2014would not claim otherwise. They would simply say that here\nthere are good reasons to hire the less meritorious applicant.\n\nRonald Dworkin once held a contrary view:\n\n\nIf a black skin will, as a matter of regrettable fact, enable another\ndoctor to do a different medical job better, then that black skin is\nby the same token \u201cmerit\u201d as well. (1985: 299)\n\n\nBut later he recanted (as Segall [2012] points out):\n\n\nI do not mean \u2026 that black color is in itself a virtue or an\naspect of merit\u2026. We do not count a person\u2019s height as a\nvirtue or a merit. But someone who is tall may just for that reason be\nbetter able to contribute, on a basketball court, to one of a\nuniversity\u2019s traditional goals, and in the same way, though for\nsadder reasons, someone who is black may for that reason be better\nable to contribute to its other goals, in the classroom and dormitory\nand in the course of his or her later career. (2000: 404)\n\n\nThe meritocrat must decide whether merit-based distribution is\ndesirable on consequentialist or categorical grounds. If the former,\nthen meritocracy will be valuable only contingently. For at least in\nprinciple, merit-based distribution may lead to suboptimal outcomes.\nOn other hand, meritocrats who say that merit-based distribution is\ncategorically desirable\u2014because, for example, it gives people\nwhat they deserve\n (\u00a74)\u2014must\n concede that their system will not always produce the best\nresults.\n",
