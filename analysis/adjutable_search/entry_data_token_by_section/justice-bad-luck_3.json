    "main_text": "Thick Luck\n4. Thick Luck\n\nThe claim that something is a matter of thin responsibility luck can\nbe combined with various accounts of responsibility and thus various\naccounts of luck. It is these latter accounts\u2014thick\naccounts of responsibility luck\u2014that tell us what makes a person\nresponsible for something. On the thick, control-based account of\nresponsibility luck:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nX is not responsible for Y; and (ii) X is\nnot responsible for Y if, and only if, X does not\nand did not control Y (Otsuka 2002, 40; Sher 2014,\n22\u201323; Zimmerman 1993, 219).\n\n\nA competing thick, choice-based account of responsibility luck\nsays:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nX is not responsible for Y; and (ii) X is\nnot responsible for Y if, and only if, Y is not, in\nan appropriate way, the result of a choice made by X (cf.\nCohen 2011, 13).\n\n\nTo see how these control-based and choice-based notions diverge,\nconsider a Frankfurtian scenario in which Y comes about as a\nresult of X\u2019s choice, but X did not control\nwhether Y came about because had X not chosen to\nbring about Y, then Y would have been realized\nthrough some alternative causal means (Frankfurt 1988). Conversely, in\na case in which X fails to make up his mind whether to\nprevent Y coming about and then finds he can no longer\ncontrol the outcome, it might be said that Y does not come\nabout as a result of X\u2019s choice even if X\ncontrolled Y.\n\nOften it makes a crucial difference which items Y ranges over\n(see Cohen 2011, 25, 93; Price 1999). Suppose, for instance, that a\nperson deliberately, and in full control, cultivates a preference for\nspending leisure hours driving about in her car reasonably foreseeing\nthat the prices of gas will stay low (Arneson 1990, 186).\nUnfortunately, and unpredictably, the price of gas skyrockets and her\npreference becomes very costly. In this case, the fact that this\nperson prefers to spend her leisure hours driving her car is neither\nbad control luck, nor bad choice luck. However, the fact that she is\nworse off as a result of her preference may be both, since she neither\nchose to act in such way to make this fact obtain, nor controlled\nwhether it did. We might say of this person that she had \u201cbad\nprice luck\u201d\n\nIt has been argued that both the control-based and choice-based thick\nnotions of luck are too broad. Most people neither control nor choose\ntheir religion, yet it seems odd to ask for compensation for feelings\nof guilt engendered by religious belief on the grounds that it is a\nmatter of bad luck that one holds those beliefs (Scanlon 1975; Cohen\n2011, 33\u201337). To accommodate this intuition G. A. Cohen\nintroduces the notion of counterfactual choice. One can\nexplain this notion with the following claim:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nX is not responsible for Y; and (ii) X is\nnot responsible for Y if, and only if, Y is not the\nresult of a choice made by X and X would not choose\nY if X could.\n\n\nGiven the opportunity to do so, the theist would not choose to be free\nof the feelings of guilt engendered by his religious convictions.\nTherefore, it is not a matter of luck that he has such feelings and so\njustice does not require him to be compensated for the feelings. As\nCohen says, the costs of the unchosen and uncontrolled commitments of\nthe religious believer \u201care so intrinsically connected with his\ncommitments that they\u201d are not bad luck (Cohen 2011, 36; compare\nCohen 2011, 88; Sher 2014, 64\u201366).\n\nJust as there are different accounts of thick responsibility luck,\nthere are different accounts of thick desert luck (for a recent\ndiscussion of the relation between luck egalitarianism and desert, see\nBrouwer and Mulligan 2019). These correspond to competing accounts of\nthe basis of desert. One notion is that of thick, non-comparative\ndesert luck, which can be elaborated as follows:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nit is not the case that X deserves Y; and (ii)\nX deserves Y if, and only if, it is fitting that\nX has Y given the moral or prudential merits of\nX.\n\n\nThe notion fleshed out here contrasts with that of thick, comparative\ndesert luck:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if, (i)\nit is not the case that X deserves Y; and (ii)\nX deserves Y if, and only if, it is fitting that\nX has Y given the relative moral or prudential\nmerits of X and Z and given what Z\nhas.\n\n\nIt may be a matter of bad thick, non-comparative desert luck that the\ncrops of a talented, hard-working farmer are destroyed by cold\nweather. If, however, the crops of a farmer who is even more\nhard-working and talented are also destroyed, it will not be a matter\nof bad thick, comparative desert luck that the first farmer\u2019s\ncrops are destroyed.\n\nThe list of thick notions of luck mentioned so far is not intended to\nbe exhaustive, and each notion may of course be developed in several\ndirections. Clearly, thick luck is quite complex.\n",
