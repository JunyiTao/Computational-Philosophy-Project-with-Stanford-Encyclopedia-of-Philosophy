Arendt\u2019s Theory of Judgment\n\n\nOne of the most enduring contributions of Arendt\u2019s political\nthought is to be found in her reflections on judgment which were to\noccupy the last years of her life. Together with the theory of action,\nher unfinished theory of judgment represents her central legacy to\ntwentieth century political thought.  We now explore some of the key\naspects of her theory of judgment, and will examine its place in the\narchitectonic of Arendt\u2019s theory of politics.\n",
