    "main_text": "Historical Remarks || The Provenance of the Distinction\n2.1 The Provenance of the Distinction\n\nThe contemporary distinction between abstract and concrete is not an\nancient one. Indeed, there is a strong case for the view that, despite\noccasional exceptions, it played no significant role in philosophy\nbefore the 20th century. The modern distinction bears some resemblance\nto Plato\u2019s distinction between Forms and Sensibles. But\nPlato\u2019s Forms were supposed to be causes par\nexcellence, whereas abstract objects are generally supposed to be\ncausally inert. The original\n\u2018abstract\u2019/\u2018concrete\u2019 distinction was a\ndistinction among words or terms. Traditional grammar distinguishes\nthe abstract noun \u2018whiteness\u2019 from the concrete noun\n\u2018white\u2019 without implying that this linguistic contrast\ncorresponds to a metaphysical distinction in what these words stand\nfor. In the 17th century, this grammatical distinction was transposed\nto the domain of ideas. Locke speaks of the general idea of a triangle\nwhich is \u201cneither Oblique nor Rectangle, neither Equilateral,\nEquicrural nor Scalenon [Scalene]; but all and none of these at\nonce,\u201d remarking that even this idea is not among the most\n\u201cabstract, comprehensive and difficult\u201d (Essay,\nIV.vii.9). Locke\u2019s conception of an abstract idea as one that is\nformed from concrete ideas by the omission of distinguishing detail\nwas immediately rejected by Berkeley and then by Hume. But even for\nLocke there was no suggestion that the distinction between abstract\nideas and concrete or particular ideas corresponds to a distinction\namong objects. \u201cIt is plain, \u2026\u201d Locke\nwrites, \u201cthat General and Universal, belong not to the real\nexistence of things; but are Inventions and Creatures of the\nUnderstanding, made by it for its own use, and concern only signs,\nwhether Words or Ideas\u201d (III.iii.11).\n\nThe abstract/concrete distinction in its modern form is meant to mark\na line in the domain of objects or entities. So conceived, the\ndistinction becomes a central focus for philosophical discussion\nprimarily in the 20th century. The origins of this development are\nobscure, but one crucial factor appears to have been the breakdown of\nthe allegedly exhaustive distinction between mental and material\nobjects, which had formed the main division for ontologically-minded\nphilosophers since Descartes. One signal event in this development is\nFrege\u2019s insistence that the objectivity and aprioricity of the\ntruths of mathematics entail that numbers are neither material beings\nnor ideas in the mind. If numbers were material things (or properties\nof material things), the laws of arithmetic would have the status of\nempirical generalizations. If numbers were ideas in the mind, then the\nsame difficulty would arise, as would countless others. (Whose mind\ncontains the number 17? Is there one 17 in your mind and another in\nmine? In that case, the appearance of a common mathematical subject\nmatter would be an illusion.) In The Foundations of\nArithmetic (1884), Frege concludes that numbers are neither\nexternal concrete things nor mental entities of any sort.\n\nLater, in his essay \u201cThe Thought\u201d (1918), Frege claims the\nsame status for the items he calls thoughts\u2014the senses\nof declarative sentences\u2014and also, by implication, for their\nconstituents, the senses of subsentential expressions. Frege does not\nsay that senses are abstract. He says that they belong to a\nthird realm distinct both from the sensible external world\nand from the internal world of consciousness. Similar claims had been\nmade by Bolzano (1837), and later by Brentano (1874) and his pupils,\nincluding Meinong and Husserl. The common theme in these developments\nis the felt need in semantics and psychology, as well as in\nmathematics, for a class of objective (i.e., non-mental) non-physical\nentities. As this new realism was absorbed into\nEnglish-speaking philosophy, the traditional term\n\u2018abstract\u2019 was enlisted to apply to the denizens of this\nthird realm. In this vein, Popper (1968) spoke of the\n\u2018third world\u2019 of abstract, objective entities, in the\nbroader sense that includes cultural products such as arguments,\ntheories, and works of art.\n\nAs we turn to an overview of the current debate, it is therefore\nimportant to remember that the use of the terms platonist\n(for those who affirm the existence of abstract objects) and\nnominalist (for those who deny existence) is somewhat\nlamentable, since these words have established senses in the history\nof philosophy. These terms stood for positions that have little to do\nwith the modern notion of an abstract object. Modern platonists (with\na small \u2018p\u2019) need not accept any of the distinctive\nmetaphysical and epistemological doctrines of Plato, just as modern\nnominalists need not accept the distinctive doctrines of the medieval\nnominalists. Moreover, the literature also contains mention of\nanti-platonists, many of whom see themselves as\nfictionalists about abstracta, though this doesn\u2019t help\nif it turns out that the best analysis of fictions is to regard them\nas abstract objects. So the reader should therefore be aware that\nterminology is not always well-chosen and that the terms so used\nsometimes stand for doctrines that are more restricted than the\ntraditional doctrines that go by the same name. Henceforth, we simply\nuse platonism for the thesis that there exists at least one\nabstract object, and nominalism for the thesis that the\nnumber of abstract objects is exactly zero (Field 1980).\n",
