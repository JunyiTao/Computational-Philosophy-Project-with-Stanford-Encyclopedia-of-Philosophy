    "main_text": "The Authority of Democracy || Instrumentalist Conceptions of Democratic Authority\n3.1 Instrumentalist Conceptions of Democratic Authority\n\nInstrumental arguments for democracy give some reason for why one\nought to respect the democracy when one disagrees with its decisions.\nThere may be many instrumental considerations that play a role in\ndeciding on the question of whether one ought to obey. And these\ninstrumental considerations are pretty much the same whether one is\nconsidering obedience to democracy or some other form of rule.\n\nThere is one instrumentalist approach which is quite unique to\ndemocracy and that seems to ground a strong conception of democratic\nauthority. That is the epistemic approach inspired by the Condorcet\nJury Theorem, which we discussed in\n section 2.1.1.2\n above. There, we discussed a number of difficulties with the\napplication of the Condorcet Jury Theorem to the case of voting in\nelections and referenda in large-scale democracies, including lack of\nindependence, informational segmentation, and the existence of\nideological biases.\n\nOne further worry about the Jury Theorem\u2019s epistemic conceptions\nof authority is that it would prove too much since it undermines the\ncommon practice of the loyal opposition in democracies. If the\nbackground conditions of the Jury Theorem are met, a large-scale\ndemocracy majority is practically certain to produce the right\ndecisions. On what basis can citizens in a political minority\nrationally hold on to their competing views? The members of the\nminority have a powerful reason for shifting their allegiance to the\nmajority position, since each has very good reason to think that the\nmajority is right. The epistemic conception of authority based on the\nJury Theorem thus threatens to be objectionably authoritarian, since\nit looks like it demands not only obedience of action but obedience of\nthought as well. Even in scientific communities the fact that a\nmajority of scientists favor a particular view does not make the\nminority scientists think that they are wrong, though it does perhaps\ngive them pause (Goodin 2003: ch. 7).\n\nSome theories of democratic authority combine instrumental and\nnon-instrumental considerations. David Estlund argues that democratic\nprocedures have legitimate authority because they are better than\nrandom and epistemically the best of the political systems that are\nacceptable to all reasonable citizens (Estlund 2008). They must be better\nthan random because, otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t we use a fair\nrandom procedure like a lottery or coin flip? Democratic authority\nmust have an epistemic element. And the justification of democratic\nprocedure must be acceptable to all reasonable citizens in order to\nrespect their freedom and equality. Estlund\u2019s conception of\ndemocratic authority\u2014which he calls \u201cepistemic\nproceduralism\u201d\u2014 thus combines the ideal of public\njustification with a concern for the tendency of democracies to\nproduce good decisions.\n",
