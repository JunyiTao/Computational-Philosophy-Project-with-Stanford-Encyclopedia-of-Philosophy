    "main_text": "\nComputational complexity theory is a subfield of theoretical computer science one of whose primary goals is to classify and compare the practical difficulty of solving problems about finite combinatorial objects \u2013 e.g. given two natural numbers \\(n\\) and \\(m\\), are they relatively prime? Given a propositional formula \\(\\phi\\), does it have a satisfying assignment? If we were to play chess on a board of size \\(n \\times n\\), does white have a winning strategy from a given initial position? These problems are equally difficult from the standpoint of classical  computability theory in the sense that they are all effectively decidable. Yet they still appear to differ significantly in practical difficulty. For having been supplied with a pair of numbers \\(m \\gt n \\gt 0\\), it is possible to determine their relative primality by a method (Euclid\u2019s algorithm) which requires a number of steps proportional to \\(\\log(n)\\). On the other hand, all known methods for solving the latter two problems require a \u2018brute force\u2019 search through a large class of cases which increase at least exponentially in the size of the problem instance.\nComplexity theory attempts to make such distinctions precise by proposing a formal criterion for what it means for a mathematical problem to be feasibly decidable \u2013 i.e. that it can be solved by a conventional Turing machine in a number of steps which is proportional to a polynomial function of the size of its input. The class of problems with this property is known as \\(\\textbf{P}\\) \u2013 or polynomial time \u2013 and includes the first of the three problems described above. \\(\\textbf{P}\\) can be formally shown to be distinct from certain other classes such as \\(\\textbf{EXP}\\) \u2013 or exponential time \u2013 which includes the third problem from above. The second problem from above belongs to a complexity class known as \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) \u2013 or non-deterministic polynomial time \u2013 consisting of those problems which can be correctly decided by some computation of a non-deterministic Turing machine in a number of steps which is a polynomial function of the size of its input. A famous conjecture \u2013 often regarded as the most fundamental in all of theoretical computer science \u2013 states that \\(\\textbf{P}\\) is also properly contained in \\(\\textbf{NP}\\) \u2013 i.e. \\(\\textbf{P} \\subsetneq \\textbf{NP}\\).\nDemonstrating the non-coincidence of these and other complexity classes remain important open problems in complexity theory. But even in its present state of development, this subject connects many topics in logic, mathematics, and surrounding fields in a manner which bears on the nature and scope of our knowledge of these subjects. Reflection on the foundations of complexity theory is thus of potential significance not only to the philosophy of computer science, but also to philosophy of mathematics and epistemology as well.\n",
