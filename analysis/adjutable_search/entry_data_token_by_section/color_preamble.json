    "main_text": "\n\nColors are of philosophical interest for a number of reasons. One of\nthe most important reasons is that color raises serious metaphysical\nissues, concerning the nature both of physical reality and of the\nmind. Among these issues are questions concerning whether color is\npart of a mind-independent reality, and what account we can give of\nexperiences of color. These issues have been, and continue to be,\ninextricably linked with important epistemological and semantic\nissues. \n",
