Tropes are things like the particular shape, weight, and\ntexture of an individual object. Because tropes are particular, for\ntwo objects to \u2018share\u2019 a property (for them both to\nexemplify, say, a particular shade of green) is for each to contain\n(instantiate, exemplify) a greenness-trope, where those\ngreenness-tropes, although numerically distinct, nevertheless exactly\nresemble each other.\n\nApart from this very thin core assumption\u2014that there are\ntropes\u2014different trope theories need not have very much in\n common.[1]\n Most trope theorists (but not all) believe\nthat\u2014fundamentally\u2014there is nothing but tropes. Most trope\ntheorists (but, again, not all) hold that resemblance between concrete\nparticulars is to be explained in terms of resemblance between their\nrespective tropes. And most (but not all) hold that resemblance\nbetween tropes is determined by their primitive intrinsic nature.\n\nThat there are tropes seems prima facie reasonable if we\nreflect on such things as perception (I don\u2019t see color in\ngeneral, but the color of this object) and causation (it\u2019s the\nweight of this object that leaves an impression in the palm of my\nhand, not weight in general). Yet, neither perception nor causation\nmanage to distinguish between a theory positing tropes and one\npositing, e.g., states of affairs (universal-exemplifications), which\nmeans that the support they provide in favor of tropes is weak at\nbest.\n\nPrima facie reasons to one side, no matter which terms they\nuse to characterize their posits, most trope theorists agree that\ntropes occupy the sweet spot between universal realism and classical\nnominalism, something that they believe allows them to reap all the\nbenefits of both of those views without having to suffer any of their\ndisadvantages. More precisely, in accepting the existence of\nproperties (or, at least, something \u2018property-like\u2019), the\ntrope theorist accepts an ontology that is fine-grained enough to be\nable to explain how distinct concrete particulars can be\nsimultaneously similar to, and different from, each other (something\nthe classical nominalist arguably fails to do, cf. Armstrong\n1978). And in rejecting the existence of universals, she avoids having\nto accept the existence of a kind of entity many find mysterious,\ncounterintuitive, and \u2018unscientific\u2019 (Schaffer 2001: 249f;\nMolnar 2003: 22\u201325; and Armstrong 2005: 310).\n\nIn this entry, reasons both for and against the existence of tropes\nare surveyed. As we shall see, what those reasons are, and how well\nthey manage to support (or cause trouble for) the trope-theoretical\nthesis, depends on which version of the trope view they concern. Much\nof the entry will therefore be dedicated to distinguishing different\nversions of the theory from each other, and to see what costs and\nbenefits adopting either version brings with it.\n", "toc": [{"#HistBack": "1.

Historical Background\n\nThe father of the contemporary debate on tropes was D. C. Williams\n(1953a; 1953b; 1963; 1986 [1959];\n 2018).[2]\n Williams defends a one-category theory of tropes (for the first time\nso labeled), a bundle theory of concrete particulars, and a\nresemblance class theory of universals. All of which are now elements\nof the so-called \u2018standard\u2019 view of tropes. Who to count\namong Williams\u2019 trope-theoretical predecessors is unavoidably\ncontentious. It depends on one\u2019s views on the nature of the\ntrope itself, as well as on which theses, besides the thesis that\ntropes exist, one is prepared to accept as part of a trope\u2014or\ntrope-like\u2014theory.\n\nAccording to some philosophers, trope theory has roots going back at\nleast to Aristotle (perhaps to Plato (cf. Buckels 2018), or\neven the pre-Socratics (cf. Mertz 1996: 83\u2013118)). In\nthe Categories, Aristotle points out that Substance and\nQuality both come in what we may call a universal and a particular\nvariety (man and this man in the case of substance,\nand pallor and this pale\u2014to ti leukon\u2014in\nthe case of quality). Not everyone believe that this means that\nAristotle accepts the existence of tropes, however. On one\ninterpretation (Owen 1965) this pale names an absolutely\ndeterminate, yet perfectly shareable, shade of pallor. But on a more\ntraditional interpretation (cf. Ackrill 1963 and, more\nrecently, Kampa & Wilkins 2018), it picks out a trope, i.e., a\nparticular \u2018bit\u2019 of pallor peculiar to the substance that\nhappens to exemplify it (for a discussion, cf. Cohen\n2013).\n\nIn view of the strong Aristotelian influence on medieval thinkers, it\nis perhaps not surprising that tropes or trope-like entities are found\nalso here. Often mentioned in this connection is Ockham (cf.\nalso Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Suarez). Ockham held that there are in\ntotal four sorts of individual things: substances, qualities,\nsubstantial forms, and matter. Claude Panaccio (2015) argues that all\nfour sorts of individual things are best understood as tropes or, in\nthe case of substances, as bundles of tropes (more precisely as\nnuclear bundles of tropes similar to those defended by e.g.,\nSimons 1994 and Kein\u00e4nen 2015).\n\nThis list of early proponents of trope-like entities could have been\nmade much longer. D. W. Mertz (1996) mentions, besides those already\nlisted, Bo\u00ebthius, Avicenna, and Averro\u00ebs. And Kevin Mulligan\net al. (1984) point out that similar views can be found defended by\nearly modern philosophers, including Leibniz, Locke, Spinoza,\nDescartes, Berkeley and Hume.\n\nStill, it is in the writings of 19th century\nphenomenological philosophers that the earliest and most systematic\npre-Williams \u2018trope\u2019-theories are found (Mulligan et al.\n1984: 293). The clearest example of an early trope theorist of this\nvariety is undoubtedly Edmund Husserl. In the third part of his\nLogical Investigations (2001 [1900/1913]), Husserl sets out\nhis theory of moments, which is his name for the\nworld\u2019s abstract (and essentially dependent) individual parts\n(Correia 2004; Beyer 2016). Husserl was most likely heavily influenced\nby Bernard Bolzano, who held that everything real is either a\nsubstance or an adherence, i.e., an attribute that cannot be shared\n(Bolzano\n 1950 [1851]).[3]\n Husserl thought of his moments as (one of) the fundamental\nconstituents of phenomenal reality. This was also how fellow\nphenomenologists G. F. Stout (1921;\n 1952),[4]\n Roman Ingarden (1964 [1947\u20131948]) and Ivar Segelberg\n (1999 [1945;1947;1953])[5]\n viewed their fundamental and trope-like posits. Williams\u2019 views\nare not so easily classified. Although he maintained that all our\nknowledge rests on perceptual experience, he agreed that it should not\nbe limited to the perceptually given and that it could be extended\nbeyond that by legitimate inference (Campbell et al. 2015). That more\nor less all post-Williams proponents of tropes treat their posits as\nthe fundamental constituents of mind-independent\u2014not\nphenomenal\u2014reality, is however clear (cf. e.g., Heil\n2003).\n\nAfter Williams, the second most influential trope theorist is arguably\nKeith Campbell (1997 [1981]; 1990). Campbell adopted the basics of\nWilliams\u2019 (standard) theory and then further developed and\ndefended it. Later proponents of more or less standard versions of the\ntrope view include Peter Simons, John Bacon, Anna-Sofia Maurin,\nDouglas Ehring, Jonathan Schaffer, Kris McDaniel, Markku\nKein\u00e4nen, Jani Hakkarainen, Marta Ujv\u00e1ri, Daniel Giberman,\nRobert K. Garcia, and Anthony Fisher (all of whose most central works\non the topic are listed in the Bibliography).\n\nA very influential paper also arguing for a version of the theory\n(inspired more by Husserl than by Williams) is\n\u201cTruth-Makers\u201d (Mulligan et al. 1984; cf. also\nDenkel 1996). This paper defends the view that tropes are essentially\ndependent entities, the objects of perception, and the world\u2019s\nbasic truthmakers. Proponents of trope theories which posit tropes as\none of several fundamental categories include C. B. Martin\n(1980), John Heil (2003), George Molnar (2003), and Jonathan Lowe\n(2006). Molnar and Heil both defend ontologies that include (but are\nnot limited to) tropes understood as powers, and Lowe counts tropes as\none of four fundamental categories. Even more unorthodox are\nthe views of Mertz (1996, 2016), whose trope-like entities are\ncategorized as a kind of\n relation.[6]\n2. The Nature of Tropes\n\nAccording to several trope theorists\u2014perhaps most notably,\naccording to Williams\u2014what exists when a trope does is an\nabstract particular. The word \u2018abstract\u2019 is\nambiguous. On the one hand, Williams tells us, it means\n\u201ctranscending individual existence, as a universal,\nessence, or Platonic idea is supposed to transcend it\u201d\n(1953a: 15). On this meaning, to be abstract is to be\nnon-spatiotemporal. Tropes\u2014which are standardly taken to exist\nin spacetime\u2014are clearly not (or, not\nnecessarily) abstract in this sense (which explains why some\nphilosophers\u2014e.g., K\u00fcng 1967; Giberman 2014, 2022;\ncf. also Simons 1994: 557\u2014insist on referring to the\ntrope as \u2018concrete\u2019). But then there is this\nother\u2014according to Williams \u201caboriginal\u201d\u2014sense\nof the term. A sense in which, to be \u2018abstract\u2019 is to be\n\u201cpartial, incomplete, or fragmentary, the trait of what\nis less than its including whole\u201d (Williams 1953a: 15).\nIt is in this sense that the trope is supposed to be\nabstract.\n\nIs saying of the trope that it is abstract in this sense enlightening?\nSome have worried that it isn\u2019t (cf. e.g., Maurin 2002:\n21; cf. also Daly 1997). That this worry is unwarranted has\nrecently been pretty convincingly argued by Fisher (2020). When\nWilliams argues that the trope is abstract in the sense of\n\u201cpartial, incomplete, or fragmentary\u201d, Fisher notes, what\nhe means is that it \u201cfails to exhaust the content of the region\nit occupies or is merely part of the content of that region\u201d\n(Fisher 2020: 45; cf. also Williams 1986 [1959]: 3). One\nconsequence of this, is that the trope can only be attended to via a\nprocess of abstraction. (In Campbell\u2019s words (1990: 2),\nit can only be \u201cbrought before the mind ... by a process of\nselection, of systematic setting aside, of these other qualities of\nwhich we are aware\u201d.) But this, Fisher points out, does\nnot mean that the trope is abstract because it is a\nproduct of abstraction (if it did, then since attending to basically\nanything (short of everything) involves abstracting away from the\nsurrounding environment, saying of the trope that it is\n\u2018abstract\u2019 would be saying nothing very\ninformative at all). What it means, rather, is that the trope is\nsomething that requires abstraction to be brought before the mind\nbecause it is abstract (which, in turn, it is\nbecause it is such that it does not exhaust the content of\nthe region it occupies or is merely part of the content of that\nregion). This takes care of this worry (for more reasons to view the\nabstractness of the trope as integral to its nature, see the\ndiscussion in section 3.1 below).\n2.1 Property or Object?\n\nIn philosophy, new posits are regularly introduced by being compared\nwith, or likened to, an already familiar item. Tropes are no exception\nto this rule. In fact, tropes have been introduced by being compared\nwith and likened to not one but two distinct but equally\nfamiliar kinds of things: properties and objects (Loux 2015). Up until\nvery recently, that tropes can be introduced in both of these ways was\nconsidered a feature of the theory, not a source of concern. Tropes,\nwas the idea, can be compared with and likened to both properties and\nobjects, because tropes are a bit of both. Recently, however,\nboth friends and foes of tropes have started to question whether\ntropes can be a bit of both. At any rate, this will depend on\nwhat being a property and being an object amounts\nto, an issue on which there is no clear consensus.\n\nLooking more closely at existing versions of the trope view, whether\none thinks of one\u2019s posit primarily as a kind of property or as\na kind of object certainly influences what one takes to be true (or\nnot) of it. To see this, compare the tropes defended by Williams with\nthose defended by Mulligan et al. Williams seems to belong to the camp\nof those who view the trope (primarily) as a kind of object. Tropes\nare that out of which everything else there is, is constructed. As a\nconsequence, names for tropes should not be understood as abbreviated\ndefinite descriptions of the kind \u2018the \u03a6-ness of\nx\u2019. Instead, to name a trope should be likened with\nbaptizing a child or with introducing a man \u201cpresent in the\nflesh\u201d, i.e., ostensively (Williams 1953a: 5). Mulligan\net al. (1984), on the other hand, seem to regard the trope more as a\nkind of property, and as a consequence of this, argue to the contrary\nthat the correct (in fact the only) way to refer to tropes is\nprecisely by way of expressions such as \u2018the \u03a6-ness of\nx\u2019. This, they claim (again pace Williams), is\nbecause tropes are essentially of some object, because they\nare ways the object is (cf. also Heil 2003: 126f).\nIn general, a theory which models its posit primarily on the property\nhence thinks of it as a dependent sort of entity, as of\nsomething else. And a theory which thinks of its tropes more as\nobjects\u2014as \u2018the alphabet of being\u2019\u2014thinks of\nthem as independent, either in the sense that they need not make up\nthe things they actually make up, or\u2014more radically\u2014in the\nsense that they need not make up anything at all (that they could be\nso-called \u2018free-floaters\u2019).\n\nHow one views the nature of properties and objects, respectively, also\nplays a role for some of the criticisms the trope view has had to\nface. So, for instance, does Jerrold Levinson think that tropes cannot\nbe a kind of property because having a property\u2014being\nred\u2014amounts to being in a certain condition, where conditions\nare not particular (Levinson 1980; 2006). The alternative is that\ntropes are what he calls \u2018qualities\u2019, by which he means\nsomething resembling bits of abstract stuff. However, since a theory\naccepting the existence of bits of abstract stuff would be both\n\u201contologically extravagant and conceptually outlandish\u201d\n(Levinson 2006: 564), abstract stuff most likely doesn\u2019t exist.\nWhich means that, according to Levinson, tropes are neither a\nkind of property nor a kind of object. A circumstance that\nmakes him conclude that tropes do not exist.\n\nArkadiusz  Chrudzimski, next, has argued that, although tropes\ncan be viewed either as a kind of property or as a kind of\nobject, they cannot be viewed as a bit of both (Chrudzimski 2002).\nWhich means that the theory loses its coveted\n\u2018middle-position\u2019, and with it any advantage it might have\nhad over rival views. For, he argues, to conceptualize the trope as a\nproperty\u2014a way things are\u2014means imputing in it a\npropositional structure (Levinson 1980: 107 holds a similar\nview). Not so if the trope is understood as a kind of object. But\nthen, although tropes understood as properties are suitable as\nsemantically efficient truthmakers, the same is not true of tropes\nunderstood as a kind of object. Conversely, although tropes understood\nas a kind of object are suitable candidates for being that from which\nboth concrete particulars and abstract universals are constructed,\ntropes understood as properties are not. Whichever way we conceive of\ntropes, therefore, the theory\u2019s overall appeal is severely\ndiminished.\n\nBoth Levinson\u2019s and Chrudzimski\u2019s pessimistic conclusions\ncan be resisted. One option is simply to refuse to accept that one\ncannot seriously propose that there are \u201cabstract stuffs\u201d.\nLevinson offers us little more than an incredulous stare in defense of\nthis claim, and incredulous stares are well-known for lacking the\nforce to convince those not similarly incredulous. Another option is\nto reject the claim that tropes understood as properties must be\npropositionally structured. Or, more specifically, to reject the claim\nthat complex truths need complex\u2014(again)\npropositionally structured\u2014truthmakers. Some truthmaker\ntheorists\u2014not surprisingly, Mulligan et al. (1984) are\namong them\u2014reject this claim. In so doing, they avoid having to\ndraw the sorts of conclusions to which Levinson and (perhaps\nespecially) Chrudzimski gesture.\n\nA more radical option, finally, is to simply reject the idea that\ntropes can be informatively categorized either as a kind of property\nor as a kind of object. Some of the features we want to attribute to\ntropes seem to cut across those categories anyhow. So, for instance,\nif you think \u2018being shareable\u2019 is essential to\n\u2018being a property\u2019, then, obviously, tropes are not\nproperties. Yet tropes, even if not shareable, can still be\nways objects are, and they can still essentially depend on\nthe objects that have them. Likewise, if \u2018monopolizing\none\u2019s position in space-time\u2019 is understood as a central\ntrait for objects, tropes are not objects. Yet tropes can still be the\nindependent building-blocks out of which everything else there is, is\nconstructed.\n\nAccording to Garcia (2015a, 2016), this is why we ought to\nframe our discussion of the nature(s) of tropes in terms of another\ndistinction. Rather than distinguishing between tropes understood as a\nkind of property, and tropes understood as a kind of object\u2014and\nrisk getting caught up in infected debates about the nature of objects\nand properties generally\u2014Garcia suggests we distinguish between\ntropes understood as \u2018modifiers\u2019 and tropes understood as\n\u2018modules\u2019. The main difference between tropes understood\nin these two ways\u2014a difference that is the source of a great\nmany further differences\u2014is that tropes understood as modifiers\ndo not have the character they confer (on objects), whereas tropes\nunderstood as modules do. With recourse to this way of distinguishing\nbetween different versions of the trope-view, Garcia argues, we can\nnow evaluate each version separately, independently of how we view\nobjects and properties,\n respectively.[7]\n2.2 Complex or Simple?\n\nAccording to most trope-theorists, tropes are ontologically simple.\nHere this should be taken to mean that tropes have no constituents, in\nthe sense that they are not \u2018made up\u2019 or\n\u2018built\u2019 from entities belonging to some other\ncategory. Simple tropes, thus understood, can still have\nparts\u2014even necessarily so\u2014as long as those parts are also\ntropes (cf. e.g., Giberman 2022; Robb 2005:\n 469).[8],[9]\n\nThat tropes are ontologically simple arguably provides the trope\ntheorist with a tie-breaker vis-\u00e0-vis states of affairs (if\nstates of affairs are understood as substrates instantiating\nuniversals). Prima facie a theory positing states of affairs\nhas the same explanatory power as a theory positing tropes. But a\ntheory of states of affairs posits\u2014apart from the state of\naffairs itself\u2014at least two (fundamental) sorts of things\n(universals and substrates), whereas a theory of tropes (at least a\ntheory of tropes according to which tropes are simple and objects are\nbundles of tropes) posits only one (tropes). From the point of view of\nontological parsimony, therefore, the trope view ought to be\n preferred.[10]\n\nCan the trope be simple? According to a number of the\ntheory\u2019s critics, it cannot. Here is Herbert Hochberg\u2019s\nargument to that effect (2004: 39; cf. also his 2001:\n178\u2013179; for versions of the argument cf. also\nBrownstein 1973: 47; Moreland 2001; Armstrong 2004; Ehring\n 2011):[11]\n\n\nLet a basic proposition be one that is either atomic or the negation\nof an atomic proposition. Then consider tropes t and\nt* where \u2018t is different from\nt*\u2019 and \u2018t is exactly similar to\nt*\u2019 are both true. Assume you take either\n\u2018diversity\u2019 or \u2018identity\u2019 as primitive. Then\nboth propositions are basic propositions. But they are logically\nindependent. Hence, they cannot have the same truth makers. Yet,\nfor\u2026trope theory /\u2026/ they do and must have the same\ntruth makers. Thus the theory fails.\n\n\nA number of different things can be said in response to this argument.\nIt assumes, first, that if tropes are simple, trope theory must\nviolate what appears to be a truly fundamental principle (call it HP,\nshort for \u2018Hochberg\u2019s principle\u2019): that\nlogically independent basic propositions must have distinct\ntruthmakers. Having to reject HP is hence a cost of having simple\ntropes. Perhaps this cost is acceptable. That it is, seems to be a\nview held by Mulligan et al. (a similar view is, according to\nArmstrong 2005: 310 also held by Robb). For, they claim (1984:\n296):\n\n\n\u2026[w]e conceive it as in principle possible that one and the\nsame truth-maker may make true sentences with different meanings: this\nhappens anyway if we take non-atomic sentences into account, and no\narguments occur to us which suggest that this cannot happen for atomic\nsentences as well.\n\n\nOne reason for rejecting HP has been put forward by Fraser MacBride\n(2004). HP, he notes, is formulated in terms of\n\u2018logically independent basic propositions\u2019.\nHowever, HP is only plausible if it takes more than logical (what\nMacBride calls \u2018formal\u2019) (in)dependence into account:\nmaterial independent also\n matters![12]\n Only if two propositions are logically and materially\nindependent does it follow that they must have distinct truthmakers.\nBut formal and material independence can\u2014and in this case most\nlikely will\u2014come apart. For (ibid: 190):\n\n\n\u2026[i]nsofar as truth-makers are conceived as inhabitants of the\nworld, as creatures that exist independently of language, it is far\nfrom evident that logically independent statements in the formal sense\nare compelled to correspond to distinct truth-makers.\n\n\nAnother argument against the simplicity of tropes comes from Ehring\nand was inspired by an argument first delivered by Moreland (2001:\n64). J. P. Moreland\u2019s argument concludes that trope theory is\nunintelligible. Ehring thinks this is much too strong. This is\ntherefore the formulation of the objection he prefers (2011: 180):\n\n\nThe nature and particularity of a trope are intrinsically grounded in\nthat trope. If tropes are simple, their nature and their particularity\nare hence identical. The natures of a red trope and an orange trope\nare inexactly similar. Hence their respective particularities should\nbe inexactly similar as well. However, these particularities are\nexactly similar. Hence, their particularities are not\nidentical to their natures, and tropes are not simple.\n\n\nHere the trope theorist could probably reply that the objection rests\non a kind of category mistake: that \u2018particularities\u2019 are\nquite simply not things amenable to standing in similarity relations.\nAlternatively, she might just concede that tropes are complex, yet\nargue that they are so in the innocent sense of having other tropes as\nparts (one particularity-trope and a distinct nature-trope). Against\nthis, Ehring (2011: 183f) has argued that if the trope has its\nparticularity reside in one of the tropes that make it up, we can\nalways ask about that trope what grounds its\nparticularity and nature respectively. Which would seem to lead us\ninto an infinite\u2014and most probably vicious\u2014regress.\n\nEhring\u2019s own solution to the problem is to adopt a version of\nthe trope view (what he calls Natural Class Trope Nominalism) on which\ntropes do not resemble each other in virtue of their nature, but\nrather in virtue of belonging to this or that natural class. On this\nview, what makes two tropes qualitatively the same (their belonging to\nthe same natural class of tropes) is different from what makes them\ndistinct (the tropes themselves, primitively being what they are).\nWhich means that, that tropes can be distinct yet exactly resemble\neach other is no longer a reason to think that tropes are complex.\n\nA different kind of solution has recently been proposed by Giberman\n(2022, cf. also his 2014). According to him, because\nat least some of the tropes there are, are spatiotemporally located\n(they are what he calls\n \u2018concrete\u2019)[13],\n they must have size, shape, and duration. That tropes have these\ndifferent features means that they are capable of multiple\nresemblances. Which, claims Giberman, means that they are\nqualitatively complex. Yet that they are does not threaten the trope\nview in any way. For, according to Giberman, tropes are (qualitatively\ncomplex) ostriches. What this means is that tropes are such\nthat they \u201cprimitively account for their own multiple\nresemblance capacities\u201d. Which means that \u201cno (further)\nontological machinery is required to explain that an ostrich trope has\nmultiple properties\u201d (even though we are admitting that it\ndoes!) (Giberman 2022: 18). In this sense, the trope is like the\nQuinean concrete particular (Giberman ibid.; cf. also Quine\n1948, Devitt 1980):\n\n\nWhen the Quinean is asked what it is about a given electron that\nmetaphysically explains its ability to resemble both massive things\nand charged things, he will likely answer \u2018nothing!\u2014it\njust is that way\u2019... Similarly, when asked what it is about the\nn charge trope that metaphysically explains its ability to\nresemble both charged things and things of a certain size, the ostrich\ntrope theorist answers: \u2018the trope itself\u2014no more\nstructure to it than that\u2019.\n\n\nBut then, on Giberman\u2019s view\u2014and pace\nEhring\u2014we are not allowed to ask of the properties of\nthe trope what grounds their particularity and nature\n(that\u2019s primitive!). And if asking this is not allowed, is the\nidea, no infinite regress can be generated (cf. also fn 20,\nthis entry).\n\nWhat about the advantage the trope view was supposed to have over the\nstate-of-affairs view? Primitive or not, if the complexity is there,\ndoesn\u2019t this mean that those views are now on a par\nparsimony-wise? Giberman doesn\u2019t think so, and gives two reasons\nwhy not: (1) although the ostrich trope is qualitatively complex, it\nis not\u2014unlike the state of affairs\u2014categorially\ncomplex (no trope has a constituent from outside the category\ntrope) (2022: 16); (2) (more contentiously) even states of\naffairs, in being spatiotemporal, need to have size and shape etc. But\nthen, apart from having to accept the existence of categorially\ndistinct substrates, the state of affairs theorist must also accept\nthat universals\u2014like tropes\u2014are primitively qualitatively\ncomplex (ibid: 18).\n2.3 Trope Individuation\n\nWhat makes two tropes, existing in the same world at the same time,\n distinct?[14]\n\nA natural suggestion is that we take the way we normally identify and\nrefer to tropes very literally and individuate tropes with reference\nto the objects that \u2018have\u2019 them:\n\nObject Individuation (OI):\nFor any tropes a and b such that a exactly\nresembles b, a \u2260 b iff a\nbelongs to an object that is distinct from the object to which\nb belongs.\n\n\nNo trope theorist endorses this natural suggestion, however. The\nreason why not is that, at least if objects are bundles of tropes, the\nindividuation of objects will depend on the individuation of the\ntropes that make them up, which means that, on OI, individuation\nbecomes circular (Lowe 1998: 206f.; Schaffer 2001: 249; Ehring 2011:\n77). Indeed, matters improve only marginally if objects are understood\nas substrates in which tropes are instantiated. For, although on this\nview, OI does not force one to accept a circular account of\nindividuation, this is because it is now the substrate which carries\nthe individuating burden. This leaves the individuation of the\nsubstrate still unaccounted for, and so we appear to have gotten\nnowhere (Mertz 2001). Any trope theorist who accepts the possible\nexistence of \u2018free-floating\u2019 tropes\u2014i.e., tropes\nthat exist unattached to any object\u2014must in any case\nreject this account of trope individuation (at least as long as she\naccepts the possibility of there being more than one\nfree-floating trope at any given time).\n\nThe main-contenders are instead spatiotemporal individuation\n(SI) and primitivist individuation (PI). According to SI,\nfirst, that two tropes belonging to the same world are distinct can be\nmetaphysically explained with reference to a difference in their\nrespective spatiotemporal position (Campbell 1990: 53f.; Lowe 1998:\n207; Schaffer 2001: 249; Giberman 2022: 18):\n\nSpatiotemporal Individuation (SI):\nFor any tropes a and b such that a\nexactly resemble b, a \u2260 b iff a\nis at non-zero distance from b.\n\n\nThis is an account of trope individuation that seems to respect the\nway tropes are normally picked out, yet which does\nnot\u2014circularly\u2014individuate tropes with reference to the\nobjects they make up and which does not rule out the existence of\n\u2018free-floaters\u2019. In spite of this, the majority of the\ntrope theorists (Schaffer 2001 being one important exception) have\nopted instead for primitivism (cf. e.g., Ehring 2011: 76;\nCampbell 1990: 69; Kein\u00e4nen & Hakkarainen 2014). Primitivism\nis best understood as the denial of the idea that there is any true\nand informative way of filling out the biconditional \u2018For any\nexactly resembling tropes a and b, a \u2260\nb iff \u2026\u2019. That a and b are\ndistinct\u2014if they are\u2014is hence primitive. It has no further\n(ontological) analysis or (metaphysical) explanation.\n\nAccording to what is probably the most influential argument in favor\nof PI over SI (an argument that changed Campbell\u2019s mind:\ncf. his 1990: 55f.; cf. also Moreland 1985: 65), SI\nshould be abandoned because it rules out the (non-empty) possibility\nthat (parts of) reality could be\n non-spatiotemporal.[15]\n Against this, proponents of SI have argued that the thesis that\nreality must be spatiotemporal can be independently justified\n(primarily because naturalism can be independently justified,\ncf. Schaffer 2001: 251). And even if it cannot, SI could\neasily be modified to accommodate the analogue of the\nlocational order of space (Campbell 1997 [1981]: 136; Schaffer\n ibid.).[16]\n\nA common argument in favor of SI is that it allows its\nproponents to rule out what most agree are empty\npossibilities: swapping and piling.\n\nSwapping: According to the so-called \u2018swapping\nargument\u2019 (first formulated in Armstrong 1989: 131\u2013132;\ncf. also Schaffer 2001: 250f; Ehring 2011:\n 78f.),[17], [18]\n if properties are tropes, and individuation is primitive, two\ndistinct yet exactly similar tropes might swap places (this redness\nhere might have been there, and vice versa). The\nresult, post-swap, is a situation that is ontologically distinct from\nthat pre-swap. However, empirically/causally the pre- and post-swap\nsituations are the same (cf. LaBossiere 1993: 262 and Denkel\n1996: 173f. for reasons to doubt that they are the same).\nThat is, given the natural laws as we know them, that this red-trope\nhere swaps places with that red-trope there makes no\ndifference to the future evolution of things. Which means that, not\nonly would the world look, feel and smell exactly the same to us pre-\nand post-swap, it would be in principle impossible to construct a\ndevice able to distinguish the two situations from one another. For\nany device able to detect the (primitive) difference between the two\nsituations would also have to be a device able to communicate this\ndifference (by making a sound, by turning a handle, etc\u2026) yet\nthis is precisely what the fact that swapping makes no difference to\nthe future evolution of things prevents (cf. Dasgupta 2009).\nThis makes admitting the possibility of swapping seem unnecessary. If\nwe also accept the (arguably reasonable) Eleatic principle according\nto which only changes that matter empirically/causally should count as\ngenuine, we can draw the even stronger conclusion that swapping is not\ngenuinely possible, and, hence, that any account of individuation from\nwhich it follows that it is, should be\n abandoned.[19]\n\nTo accept SI does not immediately block swapping (Schaffer 2001: 250).\nFor, SI (just like OI and PI) is a principle about trope individuation\nthat holds intra-worldly. In this case: within any given\nworld, no two exactly similar tropes are at zero distance from each\nother. Swapping, on the other hand, concerns what is possibly true (or\nnot) of exactly similar tropes considered inter-worldly. But\nthis means that, although SI does not declare swapping possible, it\ndoesn\u2019t rule it out either. According to the proponent of SI,\nthis is actually a good thing. For there is one possibility that it\nwould be unfortunate if one\u2019s principle of individuation\ndid block, namely the possibility\u2014called\nsliding\u2014that this red-trope here could have\nbeen there had the wind blown differently (Schaffer 2001:\n251). To get the desired result (i.e., to block swapping while\nallowing for sliding), Schaffer suggests we combine trope theory with\nSI and a Lewisian counterpart theory of transworld identity\n(Lewis 1986). The result is an account according to which exactly\nresembling tropes are intra-worldly identical if they inhabit\nthe same position in space-time. And according to which they are\ninter-worldly counterparts, if they are distinct, yet stand\nin sufficiently similar distance- and other types of relations to\ntheir respective (intra-worldly) neighbors. With this addition in\nplace, Schaffer claims, a trope theory which individuates its posits\nwith reference to their spatiotemporal position will make\nroom for the possibility of sliding, because (2001: 253):\n\n\nOn the counterfactual supposition of a shift in wind, what results is\na redness exactly like the actual one, which is in perfectly\nisomorphic resemblance relations to its worldmates as the actual one\nis to its worldmates, with just a slight difference in distance with\nrespect to, e.g., the roundness of the moon.\n\n\n\u2026yet it won\u2019t allow for the possibility of\nswapping, because:\n\n\n\u2026the nearest relative of the redness of the rose which is\nhere at our world would be the redness still here\n\u2018post-swap\u2019. The redness which would be here has exactly\nthe same inter- and intraworld resemblance relations as the redness\nwhich actually is here, and the same distance relations, and hence is\na better counterpart than the redness which would be\nthere.\n\n\nThis is not necessarily a reason to prefer SI over PI, however. For,\nPI, just like SI, is an inter-worldly principle of individuation,\nwhich means that it, just like SI, could be combined with a Lewisian\ncounterpart theory, thereby preventing swapping yet making room for\nsliding. It is, in other words, the counterpart theory, and not SI (or\nPI), which does all the work. In any case, it is not clear that\nintra-worldly swapping is an empty possibility. According to\nEhring, there are circumstances in which a series of slidings\nconstitute one case of swapping, something that he thinks would make\nswapping more a reason for than against PI (Ehring 2011:\n81\u201385).\n\nPiling: Even if swapping does not give us a reason to prefer\nSI over PI, perhaps its close cousin \u2018piling\u2019 does.\nConsider a particular red rose. Given trope theory, this rose is red\nbecause it is partly constituted by a redness-trope. But what is to\nprevent more than one\u2014even indefinitely\nmany\u2014exactly similar red-tropes from partly constituting this\nrose? Given PI: nothing. It is however far from clear how one could\nempirically detect that the rose has more than one redness trope, just\nlike it is not clear how one could empirically detect how many redness\ntropes it has, provided it has more than one. This is primarily\nbecause it is far from clear how having more than one redness trope\ncould make a causal difference in the world. But if piling makes no\nempirical/causal difference, then given a (plausible) Eleatic\nprinciple, the possibility of piling is empty, which means that PI\nought to be rejected (Armstrong 1978: 86; cf. also Simons\n1994: 558; Schaffer 2001: 254, fn. 11).\n\nIn defense of PI, its proponents now point to a special case of\npiling, called \u2018pyramiding\u2019 (an example being a 5 kg\nobject consisting of five 1 kg tropes). Pyramiding does seem\ngenuinely possible. Yet, if piling is ruled out, so is pyramiding\n(Ehring 2011: 87ff.; cf. also Armstrong 1997: 64f.; Daly\n1997: 155). According to Schaffer, this is fine. For, although\nadmittedly not quite as objectionable as other types of piling (which\nhe calls \u2018stacking\u2019), pyramiding faces a serious problem\nwith predication: if admitted, it will be true of the 5 kg object that\n\u201c[i]t has the property of weighing 1 kg\u201d (Schaffer 2001:\n254). Against this, Ehring has pointed out that to say of the 5 kg\nobject that \u201c[i]t has the property of weighing 1 kg\u201d is at\nmost pragmatically odd, and that, even if this oddness is regarded as\nunacceptable, to avoid it would not require the considerable\ncomplication of one\u2019s theory of predication imagined by Schaffer\n(Ehring 2011: 88\u201391).\n\nAccording to Schaffer, the best argument for the possibility of\npiling\u2014hence the best argument against SI\u2014is rather\nprovided by the existence of so-called bosons (photons being one\nexample). Bosons are entities which do not obey Pauli\u2019s\nExclusion Principle, and hence such that two or more bosons\ncan occupy the same quantum state. A \u2018one-high\u2019\nboson-pile is hence empirically distinguishable from a\n\u2018two-high\u2019 one, which means that the possibility of piling\nin general is not ruled out even if we accept an Eleatic principle.\nSchaffer (2001: 255) suggests we solve this problem for SI by\nconsidering the wave\u2014not the particle/boson\u2014as the way the\nobject \u2018really\u2019 is. But this solution comes with\ncomplications of its own for the proponent of SI. For, \u201c[t]he\nwave function lives in configuration space rather than physical space,\nand the ontology of the wave function, its relation to physical space,\nand its relation to the relativistic conception of spacetime which SI\nso naturally fits remain deeply mysterious\u201d (Schaffer 2001:\n 256).[20]\n3. Tropes as Building Blocks\n\nAs we have seen, tropes can be conceptualized, not just as\nparticularized ways things are, but also\u2014and on some\nversions of trope theory, primarily\u2014as that out of which\neverything else there is, is constructed. Minimally, this means that\ntropes must fulfill at least two constructive tasks: that of making up\n(the equivalent of) the realist\u2019s universal, and that of making\nup (the equivalent of) the nominalist\u2019s concrete particular.\n3.1 Tropes and Universals\n\nHow can distinct things have things\u2014their properties\u2014in\ncommon? This is the problem of \u2018the One over Many\u2019\n(cf. e.g., Rodriguez-Pereyra 2000; Maurin 2022: sect. 2).\nUniversals provide a straightforward solution to this problem:\ndistinct things can have things in common, because there is a type of\nentity\u2014the universal\u2014capable of existing in (and hence\ncharacterizing) more than one object at once. The trope\ntheorist\u2014at least if she does not accept the existence of\nuniversals in addition to\n tropes[21]\u2014does\n not have recourse to entities that can be likewise identical in\ndistinct instances. She must therefore come up with an alternative\nsolution. Here I\u2019ll consider three.\n\nThe Resemblance Class Theory: The most commonly accepted\ntrope-solution to the problem of the One over Many takes two objects\na and b to \u2018share\u2019 a\nproperty\u2014F-ness\u2014 if at least one of of the tropes\nthat make up a belongs to the same (exact) resemblance class\nas at least one of the (numerically distinct) tropes that make up\nb (cf. Williams 1953a: 10; Campbell 1990:\n31f.; cf. also Lewis 1986: 64f.). Exact resemblance is an\nequivalence relation (although cf. Mormann 1995 for\nan alternative view), which means that it is a symmetrical,\nreflexive, and transitive relation. Because it is an\nequivalence relation, exact resemblance partitions the set of tropes\ninto mutually excluding and non-overlapping classes. Exact resemblance\nclasses of tropes, thus understood, function more or less as the\ntraditional universal does. Which is why proponents of this view think\nthe problem can be solved with reference to them.\n\nA point of contention among those who hold this view is if accepting\nit mean having to accept the existence of resemblance relations. Those\nwho think it doesn\u2019t, point out that resemblance is an\ninternal relation which supervenes on whatever it relates:\nthat the (degree of) resemblance between distinct tropes is entailed\nsimply given their\n existence.[22]\n Assuming that our ontology is \u2018sparse\u2019 (a thought many\nbelieve can be independently justified, cf. e.g., Schaffer\n2004 and Armstrong 1978), only what is minimally required to make true\nall truths exists. Which means that, if resemblance is an internal\nrelation, what exists when distinct tropes resemble each\nother\u2014and so what plays the role of the realist\u2019s\nuniversal\u2014is nothing but the resembling tropes themselves\n(Williams 1963: 608; Campbell 1990: 37f.; cf. also Armstrong\n1989: 56).\n\nDoes it follow from the fact that exact resemblance must obtain given\nthe existence of its relata, that it is no ontological addition to\nthem? Some philosophers (Daly 1997: 152 is among them) do not think\nso. But if it doesn\u2019t follow, some have argued, the trope\ntheorist must combat a trope theoretical version of what has become\nknown as \u2018Russell\u2019s regress\u2019. Russell\u2019s\nregress (perhaps better: Russell\u2019s regress argument) is\nan argument to the effect that, if some particulars (Russell was\nthinking of concrete particulars, not of tropes) (exactly) resemble\neach other, then either the relation of resemblance exists and is\na universal, or we end up in (vicious) infinite regress (Russell\n1997 [1912]: 48; cf. also K\u00fcng 1967). Chris Daly (1997:\n149) provides us with a trope-theoretical version of this\n argument:[23]\n\n\nConsider three concrete particulars which are the same shade of\nred\u2026each of these concrete particulars has a red\ntrope\u2014call these tropes F, G, and\nH\u2014and these concrete particulars exactly resemble each\nother in colour because F, G, and H exactly\nresemble each other in colour. But it seems that this account is\nincomplete. It seems that the account should further claim that\nresemblance tropes hold between F, G, and\nH. That is, it seems that there are resemblance tropes\nholding between the members of the pairs F and G,\nG and H, and F and H\u2026 Let\nus call the resemblance tropes in question R1,\nR2, and R3\u2026each of\nthese resemblance tropes in turn exactly resemble each other.\nTherefore, certain resemblance tropes hold between these\ntropes\u2026we are launched on a regress.\n\n\nThis regress is a problem only if it is vicious. The most\nconvincing reason for thinking that it is not is provided if we\nconsider the \u2018pattern of dependence\u2019 it\n instantiates.[24]\n For, as we have seen, even those who do not think that the\ninternality of exact resemblance makes it a mere\n\u2018pseudo-addition\u2019 to its subvenient base, agree that\nresemblance, whatever it is, is such that its existence is necessarily\nincurred simply given the existence of its relata. But then, no matter\nhow many resemblances we regressively generate, ultimately they all\ndepend for their existence on the existence of the resembling tropes,\nwhich resemble each other because of their individual nature, which is\nprimitive. This means that the existence of the regress in no way\ncontradicts\u2014it does not function as a reductio\nagainst\u2014the resemblance of the original tropes. On the contrary;\nit is because the tropes resemble each other, that the\nregress exists. Therefore, the regress is benign (cf. e.g.,\nCampbell 1990: 37; Maurin 2013).\n\nThis response only works if the nature of individual\ntropes\u2014their being what they are\u2014is primitive and\nnot further analyzable (i.e., it only works if we assume a standard\nview of the nature of tropes). To see this, compare the standard view\nwith a view with which it is often confused: resemblance nominalism.\nOn a version of the trope view according to which universals are\nresemblance classes of tropes, tropes have the same nature if they\nresemble each other. Yet, importantly, they resemble each other (or\nnot) in virtue of the (primitive) nature they each\n\u2018have\u2019 (or \u2018are\u2019). Resemblance\nnominalism, on the other hand, is the view that two objects have the\nnatures they do in virtue of the resemblance relations which obtain\nbetween them. This means that, whether they resemble or not, is not\ndecided given the existence and nature of the objects themselves.\nRather, the pattern of dependence is the other way around. And\nthis\u2014arguably\u2014makes the regress vicious. Perhaps for that\nreason, resemblance nominalism has no explicit proponent among the\ntrope theorists.\n\nThe Natural Class Theory: Those not convinced that\n\u2018Daly\u2019s regress\u2019 is benign might prefer a view\n(first defended by Ehring 2011: 175f) according to which the trope is\nnot what it is either primitively or because of whatever resemblance\nrelations it stands in to other tropes, but because of the natural\nclass to which it belongs. Accepting this view provides us with a new\nsolution to the problem of the One over Many, one that does not depend\non the existence (or not) of exact resemblance relations. On this\nview, more precisely, two objects a and b\n\u2018share\u2019 a property\u2014F-ness\u2014 if at\nleast one of the tropes that make up a belongs to the same\nnatural class as at least one of the tropes that make up b.\nThe problem with this alternative is that it appears\nto\u2014implausibly\u2014turn explanation on its head. If accepted,\ntropes do not belong to this or that class because of their nature.\nRather, tropes have the natures they do because they belong to this or\nthat class.\n\nThe Trope-Kind Theory: Although he in his (1953a)\nbriefly \u2018dallied\u2019 (his word) with the view that, to be a\nuniversal is to be a resemblance class of tropes, Williams soon\nthereafter changed his mind (cf. esp. his 1986 [1959] and\n 1963).[25]\n According to the view he adopted instead of the resemblance view,\nuniversals are neither \u201cmade\u201d nor \u201cdiscovered\u201d\nbut are something we acknowledge \u201cby a relaxation of the\nidentity conditions of thought and language\u201d (1986 [1959]: 8;\ncf. also Campbell 1990: 44). If the F-ness of a and\nthe F-ness of b is counted in a way that is subject to the\nrule that anything indiscernible is identical, their sameness is\nexplained with reference to the universal they share. And if the\nF-ness of a and the F-ness of b is counted in a way\nthat isn\u2019t subject to that rule, their sameness is\nexplained with reference to their individual, distinct, yet exactly\nresembling tropes. Importantly, Williams thinks of this as a kind of\nrealism\u2014an immanent realism\u2014about\nuniversals (Fisher 2017: 346; cf. also Fisher 2018 and\nHeil 2012: 102f.). It takes universals to be \u201cpresent in, and in\nfact components of, their instances\u201d (Williams 1986 [1959]: 10).\nYet, as noted by Fisher (2017: 346) tropes are still the primitive\nelements of being. Universals are real in virtue of being\nmind-independent. Yet, universals aren\u2019t fundamental\n(Fisher: ibid.):\n\n\nTheir reality is determined by mind-independent facts about tropes.\nTropes manifest universals in the sense that universals are nothing\nover and above property instances as tropes are by their nature of\nkinds.\n\n\nThe trope-kind theory offers an interesting and so far surprisingly\nlittle discussed solution to the problem of the One over Many. So far,\nit is a view with few if any explicit contemporary proponents (though\ncf. Paul 2002, 2017 and van Inwagen 2017:\n 348f.[26]).\n It is not unlikely that this state of affairs is now about to\nchange.\n3.2 Tropes and Concrete Particulars\n\nThe second constructive task facing the trope theorist is that of\nbuilding something that behaves like a concrete particular, using only\ntropes. Exactly how a concrete particular behaves is of course a\nmatter that can be debated. This is not a debate to which the trope\ntheorist has had very much\u2014or at least not anything very\noriginal\u2014to contribute. Instead, the trope theoretical\ndiscussion has been focused on an issue that needs solving\nbefore questions concerning what a concrete particular can or\ncannot do more precisely become relevant: the issue of if and\nhow tropes make up concrete particulars in the first\nplace.\n\nWhether this issue is best approached by considering if and how tropes\ncan make up or ground the existence of what me might call\n\u2018ordinary\u2019 or \u2018everyday\u2019 objects, or if it is\nbetter to concentrate instead on the world\u2019s simplest, most\nfundamental, objects\u2014like those you find discussed in e.g.,\nfundamental physics\u2014is another issue on which trope theorists\ndisagree. Campbell thinks we should concentrate on the latter sort of\nobject. In particular, he thinks we should concentrate on objects that\nhave no other objects as parts, as that way we avoid confusing\n\u2018substantial\u2019 complexity (and unity) with the\u2014here\nrelevant\u2014qualitative one. David Robb (2005) and Kris McDaniel\n(2001) disagree. This may in part be due to the fact that they both\n(cf. also Paul 2002, 2017) think that objects are\nmereologically composed both on the level of their\nsubstantial parts and on the level of their\n qualitative\u2014trope\u2014parts.[27]\n\nAccording to a majority of the trope theorists, objects are bundles of\ntropes. The alternative is to understand objects as complexes\nconsisting of a substrate in which tropes are instantiated (a view\ndefended by e.g., Martin 1980; Heil 2003; and Lowe 2006). Indeed,\naccording to D. M. Armstrong (1989, 2004)\u2014a staunch but\ncomparatively speaking rather friendly trope-critic\u2014this\nminority view ought to be accepted by the trope theorist.\nArmstrong is most likely wrong, however: several reasons exist for why\none ought to prefer the bundle view (Maurin 2016). One such reason has\nto do with parsimony. If you adopt a substrate-attribute view, you\naccept the existence of substrates on top of the existence of tropes.\nAccepting this additional category of entity makes at least some sense\nif properties are universals. For if objects are bundles of universals\nand universals are entities which are numerically identical across\ninstances, then if object a is qualitatively identical to\nobject b, a is also numerically identical to\nb. Which means that, if objects are bundles of universals,\nthe Identity of Indiscernibles is not just true, but necessarily true,\na consequence few universal realists have been prepared to accept\n(indeed, a consequence that may turn out to be unacceptable as a\nmatter of empirical fact\u2014cf. e.g., French 1988).\nIf objects are substrates exemplifying universals, on the other hand,\nalthough a and b are qualitatively identical, they\nare nevertheless distinct. They are distinct, that is, in virtue\nof being partly constituted by (primitively) distinct\nsubstrates.\n\nThis sort of argument in favor of the substrate-attribute view cannot\nbe recreated for a view on which properties are tropes, however. For,\nif objects are bundles of tropes, because tropes are particulars\nnot universals, even if a and b are\nqualitatively identical, they are not numerically identical. And they\nare not numerically identical because they are constituted by\nnumerically distinct tropes. No need for substrates!\n\nAccording to the bundle view, objects consist of, are made up by, or\nare grounded in, a sufficient number of mutually compresent\nand/or in some other way mutually dependent tropes (cf. e.g.,\nMcDaniel 2001, 2006 and Giberman 2014 for slightly different takes on\nbundling). What is compresence? When the same question was asked about\n(exact) resemblance, the trope theorist had the option of treating the\nrelation as a \u2018pseudo-addition\u2019. This was because\nresemblance is an internal relation and so holds necessarily simply\ngiven the existence of its relata. According to most trope-theorists,\nhowever, compresence is an external relation, and hence a\nreal addition to the tropes it\n relates.[28]\n But then adding compresence gives rise to an infinite regress (often\ncalled \u2018Bradley\u2019s regress\u2019 after Bradley 1930 [1893];\ncf. also Armstrong 1978; Vallicella 2002 and 2005; Schnieder\n2004; Cameron 2008, 2022; Maurin 2012).\n\nUnlike what was true in the case of resemblance, this regress is most\nlikely a vicious regress. This is because the \u2018pattern of\ndependence\u2019 it instantiates is the opposite of that instantiated\nby the resemblance regress. In the resemblance case, for tropes\nt1, t2, and\nt3 to exactly resemble each other, it is enough\nthat they exist. Not so in the compresence case. Tropes\nt1, t2, and\nt3 could exist and not be compresent, which means\nthat in order to ensure that they are compresent, a\ncompresence-trope, c1, must be added to the\nbundle. But c1 could exist without being\ncompresent with those very tropes. Therefore, in order for\nt1, t2, t3\nand c1 to be compresent, there must be\nsomething\u2014call it c2\u2014that makes them\nso. But since c2 could exist and not be compresent\nwith t1, t2,\nt3 and c1, it too needs\nsomething that ensures its compresence with those entities. Enter\nc3. And so on. The existence of this regress\narguably contradicts\u2014and hence functions as a reductio\nagainst\u2014the compresence of the original (first-order) tropes\nand, thereby, the (possible) existence of the concrete particular.\n\nSince concrete particulars (possibly) exist, something must be wrong\nwith this argument. One option is to claim that compresence is\ninternal after all, in which case the regress (if there even is one)\nis benign (Molnar 2003; Heil 2003 and 2012; cf. also\nArmstrong 2006). This may seem attractive especially to those who\nthink of their tropes as non-transferable and as ways\nthings are. Even given this way of thinking of the nature of the\ntrope, however, to take compresence as internal means having to give\nup what are arguably some deeply held modal beliefs. For even if you\nhave reason to think that properties must be \u2018borne\u2019 by\nsome object, to be able to solve the regress-problem one would have to\naccept the much stronger thesis that every trope must be borne by a\nspecific object. If the only reason we have for\nthinking that compresence is internal in this sense is that this\nsolves the problem with Bradley\u2019s regress, therefore, we should\nopt to go down this route as a last resort only (cf. Cameron\n2006; Maurin 2010).\n\nAs a way of saving at least some of our modal intuitions while still\navoiding Bradley\u2019s regress, Simons (1994; cf. also\nKein\u00e4nen 2011 and Kein\u00e4nen and Hakkarainen 2014 for a\nslightly different version of this\n view[29])\n suggests we view the concrete particular as constituted partly by a\n\u2018nucleus\u2019 (made up from mutually and specifically\ndependent tropes) and partly\u2014at least in the normal\ncase\u2014by a \u2018halo\u2019 (made up from tropes that depend\nspecifically on the tropes in the nucleus). The result is a structured\nbundle such that, although the tropes in the nucleus at most depend\nfor their existence on the existence of tropes of the same\nkind as those now in its halo, they do not depend specifically on\nthose tropes. In this way, at least some room is made for contingency,\nyet Bradley\u2019s regress is avoided. For, as the tropes in the halo\ndepend specifically for their existence on the tropes that make up the\nnucleus, their existence is enough to guarantee the existence of the\nwhole to which they belong. This is better but perhaps not good\nenough. For, although the same object could now have had a slightly\ndifferent halo, the possibility that the tropes that actually make up\nthe halo could exist and not be joined to this particular\nnucleus is ruled out with no apparent justification (other than that\nthis helps its proponent solve the problem with the Bradley regress)\n(cf. also Garcia 2014 for more kinds of criticism of this\nview).\n\nAccording to several between themselves very different sorts of trope\ntheorists, finally, we should stop bothering with the (nature and\ndependence of the) related tropes and investigate instead the\n(special) nature of compresence itself. This seems intuitive enough.\nAfter all, is it not the business of a relation to relate? According\nto one suggestion along these lines (defended in Simons 2010; Maurin\n2002, 2010 and 2011; and Wieland and Betti 2008; cf. also\nMertz 1996, Robb 2005 and Giberman 2014 for similar views),\nnon-relational tropes have an existence that is independent of the\nexistence of some specific\u2014either non-relational or\nrelational\u2014trope, but relational tropes (including compresence)\ndepend specifically for their existence on the very tropes they\nrelate. This means that if c1 exists, it\nmust relate the tropes it in fact relates, even though those\ntropes might very well exist and not be compresent (at least not with\neach other). There is, then, no regress, and except for\nc1, the tropes involved in constituting the\nconcrete particular could exist without being compresent with each\nother. And this, in turn, means that our modal intuitions are left\nmore or less\n intact.[30]\n\nAccording to Mertz, moreover, to be able to do the unifying work for\nwhich it is introduced, compresence cannot be a universal. If it were,\nthen if one of the concrete particulars whose constituents it joins\nceases to exist, so will every other concrete particular unified by\nthe same (universal) relation of compresence. But, as Mertz points\nout, \u201cthis is absurdly counterfactual!\u201d (Mertz 1996: 190).\nNor can it be a state of affairs. For, states of affairs are in\nthemselves complexes, and so could not be used to solve the Bradley\n problem.[31]\n It seems, then, that compresence, if understood in a way that\nblocks the regress, is a trope. Assuming that Bradley\u2019s regress\nthreatens any account according to which many things make up\none unified thing (i.e., assuming that it does not only threaten the\ntrope-bundle theorist), that there is this threat may therefore turn\nout to be a reason in favor of positing tropes (Maurin\n2011).\n\nThe suggestion is not without its critics. To these belong MacBride\nwho argues that, \u201c\u2026to call a trope relational is to pack\ninto its essence the relating function it is supposed to perform\nwithout explaining what Bradley\u2019s regress calls into question,\nviz. the capacity of relations to relate\u201d (2011: 173). Rather\nthan solve the problem, in other words, MacBride thinks the suggestion\n\u201ctransfers our original puzzlement to that thing [i.e., the\ncompresence-relation]\u201d. For, he asks \u201chow can positing the\nexistence of a relational trope explain anything about its capacity to\nrelate when it has been stipulated to be the very essence of R that it\nrelates a and b. It is as though the capacity of\nrelational tropes to relate is explained by mentioning the fact that\nthey have a \u2018virtus relativa\u2019\u201d(ibid.).\n\nAssuming we agree that there is something that needs\nexplaining (i.e., assuming we agree that how several tropes\ncan\u2014contingently\u2014make up one object needs explaining), we\ncan either reject a proposed solution because we prefer what we think\nis a better solution, or we can reject it because it is in\nitself bad or unacceptable (irrespective of whether there are any\nalternative solutions on offer). MacBride appears to suggest we do the\nlatter. More precisely, what MacBride proposes is that the solution\nfails because it leaves unexplained the special \u2018power\u2019 to\nrelate it attributes to the compresence trope. If this is why the\nsuggestion fails, however, then either this is because no\nexplanation that posits something (\u2018primitively\u2019) apt to\nperform whatever function we need explained, is acceptable, or it is\nbecause in this particular case, an explanation of this kind\nwill not do. If the former, the objection risks leading to an\novergeneration of explanatory failures. Everyone will at some point\nneed to posit some things as fundamental. And in order for those\nfundamental posits to be able to contribute somehow to the theory in\nquestion, it seems we must be allowed to say something about them. We\nmust, to use the terminology introduced by Schaffer, outfit our\nfundamental posits with axioms. But then, as Schaffer also points out\n(2016: 587): \u201cit is a bad question\u2014albeit one that has\ntempted excellent philosophers from Bradley through van Fraassen and\nLewis\u2014to ask how a posit can do what its axioms say, for that\nwork is simply the business of the posit. End of story\u201d.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the problem is isolated to the case at hand, we\nare owed an explanation of what makes this case so special. MacBride\ncomplains that if the \u2018explanatory task\u2019 is that of\naccounting for the capacity of compresence to relate, being told that\ncompresence has that capacity \u2018by nature\u2019, will not do.\nPerhaps he is right about this. But, then, the explanatory task is\narguably not that one, but rather the task of accounting for the\npossible existence of concrete objects (contingently) made up from\ntropes. If this is the explanatory task, it is far from clear\nwhy positing a special kind of (relational) trope that is \u2018by\nnature\u2019 apt to perform its relating function, will not do as an\nexplanation.\n4. Trope Applications\n\nAccording to the trope proponent, if you accept the existence of\ntropes, you have the means available to solve or to dissolve a number\nof serious problems, not just in metaphysics but in philosophy\ngenerally. In what follows, the most common trope-applications\nproposed in the literature are very briefly introduced.\n4.1 Tropes in Causation and Persistence\n\nAccording to a majority of the trope theorists, an important reason\nfor thinking tropes exist is the role they play in causation. It is\nafter all not the whole stove that burns you, it is its temperature\nthat does the damage. And it is not any temperature, nor temperature\nin general, which leaves a red mark. That mark is left by the\nparticular temperature had by this particular stove now. It makes\nsense, therefore, to say that the mark is left by the stove\u2019s\ntemperature-trope, which means that tropes are very good\ncandidates for being the world\u2019s basic causal relata (Williams\n1953a; Campbell 1990; Denkel 1996; Molnar 2003; Heil 2003; ;\nGarcia-Encinas 2009; Ehring 2011).\n\nThat tropes can play a role in causation can hardly be\ndoubted. But can this role also provide the trope-proponent with a\nreason to think that tropes exist? According to the theory\u2019s\ncritics, it cannot. The role tropes (can) play in causation does not\nprovide the trope proponent with any special reason to prefer an\nontology of tropes over alternative ontologies. More specifically, it\ndoes not give her any special reason to prefer an ontology of tropes\nover one of states of affairs or events. Just like tropes, state of\naffairs and events are particular. Just like tropes, they are\nlocalized. And, just like tropes, they are non-repeatable (although at\nleast the state of affairs contains a repeatable item\u2014the\nuniversal\u2014as one of its constituents). Every reason for thinking\nthat tropes are the world\u2019s basic causal relata is therefore\nalso a reason to think that this role is played by states of affairs\nand/or\n events.[32]\n\nEhring disagrees. To see why, he asks us to consider the following\nsimple scenario: a property-instance at t1 is\ncausally responsible for an instance of the same property at\nt2. This is a case of causation which is also a\ncase of property persistence. But what does property\npersistence involve? According to Ehring, property persistence is not\njust a matter of something not changing its properties. For, even in\ncases where nothing discernibly changes, the property instantiated at\nt1 could nevertheless have been replaced by\nanother property of the same type during the period between\nt1 and t2. To be able to\nontologically explain the scenario, therefore, we first need an\naccount of property persistence able to distinguish \u2018true\u2019\nproperty persistence from cases of \u2018non-salient property\nchange\u2019 or what may also be called property type\npersistence. But, Ehring claims, this is something a theory according\nto which property instances are states of affairs cannot do (this he\ndemonstrates with the help of a number of thought experiments, which\nspace does not allow me to reproduce here, but cf. Ehring\n1997: 91ff). Therefore, causation gives us reason to think that tropes\nexist.\n\nEhring is not the only one who regards the relationship between\n(theories of) persistence and tropes as an intimate one. According to\nMcDaniel (2001)\u2014who defends a theory (TOPO) according to which\nordinary physical objects are mereological fusions of monadic and\npolyadic tropes\u2014adopting (his version of) the trope view can be\nused to argue for one particular theory of persistence:\n 3-dimensionalism.[33]\n And according to Benovsky (2013), because (non-presentist)\nendurantism is incompatible with the view that properties are\n(immanent) universals, the endurantist must embrace trope\n theory.[34]\n\nAccording to Garcia (2016), finally, what role tropes can play in\ncausation will depend on how we conceive of the nature of tropes. If\ntropes are what he calls \u2018modifiers\u2019, they do not have the\ncharacter they confer, a fact that would seem to make them less\nsuitable as causal relata. Not so if tropes are of the module kind\n(and so have the character they confer). But if tropes have the\ncharacter they confer, Garcia points out, we may always ask, e.g.: Is\nit the couch or is it the couch\u2019s couch-shaped mass-trope that\ncauses the indentation in the carpet? Garcia thinks we have reason to\nthink they both do. The couch causes the indentation by courtesy, but\nthe mass trope would have sufficed to cause it even if it had existed\nalone, unbundled with the couch\u2019s other tropes. But this\nsuggests that if tropes are of the module kind, we end up with a world\nthat is (objectionably) systematically causally overdetermined. The\nrole tropes play in causation may therefore be more problematic than\nwhat it might initially seem (though cf. Giberman 2022 for an\nobjection to Garcia\u2019s argument).\n4.2 Tropes and Issues in the Philosophy of Mind\n\nSuppose Lisa burns herself on the hot stove. One of the causal\ntransactions that then follow can be described thus: Lisa removed her\nhand from the stove because she felt pain. This is a\ndescription which seems to pick out \u2018being in pain\u2019 as one\ncausally relevant property of the cause. That \u2018being in\npain\u2019 is a causally relevant property accords well with\nour intuitions. However, to say it is leads to trouble. The reason for\nthis is that mental properties, like that of \u2018being in\npain\u2019, can be realized by physically very different systems.\nTherefore, mental properties cannot be identified with\nphysical ones. On the other hand, we seem to live in a physically\nclosed and causally non-overdetermined universe. But this means that,\ncontrary to what we have supposed so far, Lisa did not remove her hand\nbecause she felt pain. In general, it means that mental properties are\nnot causally relevant, however much they seem to be (cf. Kim\n1989 for a famous expression of this problem).\n\nIf properties are tropes, some trope theorists have proposed, this\nconclusion can be resisted (cf. Robb 1997; Martin and Heil\n1999; Heil and Robb 2003; for a hybrid version cf. Nanay\n2009; cf. also Gozzano and Orilia 2008). To see this, we need\nfirst to disambiguate our notion of a property. This notion, it is\nargued, is really two notions, namely:\n\nProperty1 = that which imparts on an individual thing\nits particular nature (property as token), and\nProperty2 = that which makes distinct things the same\n(property as type).\n\n\nOnce \u2018property\u2019 has been disambiguated, we can see how\nmental properties can be causally relevant after all. For now, if\nmental properties1 are tropes, they can be identified with\nphysical properties1. Mental properties2 can\nstill be distinguished from physical properties2, for\nproperties considered as types are\u2014in line with the\nstandard view of tropes\u2014identified with similarity classes\nof tropes. When Lisa removes her hand from the stove because she\nfeels pain, therefore, she removes her hand in virtue of\nsomething that is partly characterized by a trope which is such that\nit belongs to a class of mentally similar tropes. This trope is\nidentical with a physical trope\u2014it is both mental and\nphysical\u2014because it also belongs to a (distinct)\nsimilarity class of physically similar tropes. Therefore, mental\nproperties can be causally relevant in spite of the fact that the\nmental is multiply realizable by the physical, and in spite of the\nfact that we live in a physically closed and non-overdetermined\nuniverse.\n\nThis suggestion has been criticized. According to Paul Noordhof (1998:\n223) it fails because it does not respect the \u201cbulge in the\ncarpet constraint\u201d. For now the question which was ambiguously\nasked about properties, can be unambiguously asked about tropes: is it\nin virtue of being mental or in virtue of being physical that the\ntrope is causally relevant for the effect (for a response,\ncf. Robb 2001 and Ehring 2003)? And Sophie Gibb (2004) has\ncomplained that the trope\u2019s simple and primitive nature makes it\nunsuitable for membership in two such radically different classes as\nthat of the mentally and of the physically similar tropes,\nrespectively (for more reasons against the suggestion cf.\nMacdonald and Macdonald 2006 and Zhang 2021).\n4.3 Tropes and Perception\n\nAnother important reason for thinking that tropes exist, it has been\nproposed, is the role tropes play in perception. That what we perceive\nare the qualities of the things rather than the things themselves,\nfirst, seems plausible (for various claims to this effect,\ncf. Williams 1953a: 16; Campbell 1997 [1981]: 130;\nSchaffer 2001: 247; cf. also Nanay 2012 and Alm\u00e4ng\n2013). And that the qualities we perceive are tropes rather than\nuniversals or instantiations of universals (states of affairs) is,\naccording to Lowe, a matter that can be determined with reference to\nour experience (cf. e.g., Skrzypulec 2021 for an argument to\nthe contrary). Lowe argues (1998: 205; cf. also, Lowe 2008;\nMulligan 1999):\n\n\n[W]hen I see the leaf change in colour\u2014perhaps as it\nturned brown by a flame\u2014I seem to see something cease to\nexist in the location of the leaf, namely, its greenness. But it\ncould not be the universal greenness which ceases to exist,\nat least so long as other green things continue to exist. My opponent\nmust say that really what I see is not something ceasing to exist, but\nmerely the leaf\u2019s ceasing to instantiate greenness, or greenness\nceasing to be \u2018wholly present\u2019 just here. I can only say\nthat that suggestion strikes me as being quite false to the\nphenomenology of perception. The objects of perception seem, one and\nall, to be particulars\u2014and, indeed, a causal theory of\nperception (which I myself favour) would appear to require this, since\nparticulars alone seem capable of entering into causal relations.\n\n\nA similar view is put forth by Mulligan et al. They argue (1984:\n306):\n\n\n[W]hoever wishes to reject moments [i.e., tropes] must of course give\nan account of those cases where we seem to see and hear them, cases we\nreport using definite descriptions such as \u2018the smile that just\nappeared on Rupert\u2019s face\u2019. This means that he must claim\nthat in such circumstances we see not just independent things per\nse, but also things as falling under certain concepts or\nas exemplifying certain universals. On some\naccounts\u2026it is even claimed that we see the universal in the\nthing. But the friend of moments finds this counterintuitive. When we\nsee Rupert\u2019s smile, we see something just as spatio-temporal as\nRupert himself, and not something as absurd as a spatio-temporal\nentity that somehow contains a concept or a universal.\n\n\nThese are admittedly not very strong reasons for thinking that it is\ntropes and not state of affairs that are the objects of perception.\nFor the view that our perception of a trope is not only distinct, but\nalso phenomenologically distinguishable, from our perception of a\nstate of affairs seems grounded in little more than its\nproponent\u2019s introspective intuitions. States of affairs, just\nlike tropes, are particulars (cf. Armstrong 1997: 126 on the\n\u201cvictory of particularity\u201d). And to say, as Mulligan et\nal. do, that the very idea of something spatiotemporal containing a\nuniversal is absurd, clearly begs the question against the view they\nare opposing.\n4.4 Tropes and Semantics\n\nThat language furnishes the trope theorist with solid reasons for\nthinking that there are tropes has been indicated by several trope\ntheorists and it has also been forcefully argued, especially by\nFriederike Moltmann (2003, 2007, 2009, 2013a and\n2013b; cf. also Mertz 1996: 3\u20136). Taking\n(Mulligan et al. 1984) as her point of departure, Moltmann argues that\nnatural language contains several phenomena whose semantic treatment\nis best spelled out in terms of an ontology that includes tropes.\n\nNominalizations, first, may seem to point in the opposite\ndirection. For, in the classical discussion, the nominalization of\npredicates such as is wise into nouns fit to refer, has been\ntaken to count in favor of universal realism. A sub-class of\nnominalizations\u2014such as John\u2019s wisdom\u2014can,\nhowever, be taken to speak in favor of the existence of tropes. This\nis a kind of nominalization which, as Moltmann puts it,\n\u201cintroduce \u2018new\u2019 objects, but only partially\ncharacterize them\u201d (2007: 363). That these nominalizations refer\nto tropes rather than to states of affairs, she argues, can be seen\nonce we consider the vast range of adjectival modifiers they allow\nfor, modifiers only tropes and not states of affairs can be the\nrecipients of (2009: 62\u201363; cf. also her 2003).\n\nBare demonstratives, next, especially as they occur in\nso-called identificational sentences, provide another reason for\nthinking that tropes exist (Moltmann 2013a). In combination\nwith the preposition like\u2014as in Turquoise looks\nlike that\u2014they straightforwardly refer to tropes. But even\nin cases where they do not refer to tropes, tropes nevertheless\ncontribute to the semantics of sentences in which they figure. In\nparticular, tropes contribute to the meaning of sentences like\nThis is Mary or That is a beautiful woman. These are\nno ordinary identity statements. What makes them stand out, Moltmann\npoints out, is the exceptional neutrality of the demonstratives in\nsubject position. These sentences are best understood in such a way\nthat the bare demonstratives that figure in them do not refer to\nindividuals (like Mary), but rather to perceptual features (which\nMoltmann thinks of as tropes) in the situation at hand.\nIdentificational sentences, then, involve the identification of a\nbearer of a trope via the denotation (if not reference) of a\n(perceptual) trope.\n\nComparatives\u2014like John is happier than\nMary\u2014finally, are according to the received view such that\nthey refer to abstract objects that form a total ordering (so-called\ndegrees). According to Moltmann, a better way to understand these\nsorts of sentences is with reference to tropes. John is happier\nthan Mary should hence be understood as John\u2019s\nhappiness exceeds Mary\u2019s happiness. Moltmann thinks this\nway of understanding comparatives is preferable to the standard view,\nbecause tropes are easier to live with than \u201cabstract, rarely\nexplicit entities such as degrees or sets of degrees\u201d (Moltmann\n2009: 64).\n\nWhether nominalizations, bare demonstratives and/or comparatives\nsucceed in providing the trope theorist with strong reasons to think\ntropes exist will, among other things, depend on whether or not they\nreally do manage to distinguish between tropes and states of affairs.\nMoltmann thinks they do but, again, this depends on how one\nunderstands the nature of the items in question. It will also depend\non if and how one thinks goings on at the linguistic level can tell us\nanything much about what there is at the ontological level. According\nto quite a few trope theorists (cf. esp. Heil 2003), we\nshould avoid arguing from the way we conceptualize reality to\nconclusions about the nature of reality itself. Depending on\none\u2019s take on the relationship between language and world,\ntherefore, semantics might turn out to have precious little to say\nabout the existence (or not) of tropes.\n4.5 Tropes in Science\n\nDiscussions of what use can be made of tropes in science can be found\nscattered in the literature. Examples include Rom Harr\u00e9\u2019s\n(2009) discussion of the role tropes play (and don\u2019t play) in\nchemistry, and Bence Nanay\u2019s (2010) attempt to use tropes to\nimprove on Ernst Mayr\u2019s population thinking in biology. Most\ndiscussions have however been focused on the relationship between\ntropes and physics (Kuhlmann et al. 2002). Most influential in this\nrespect is Campbell\u2019s field-theory of tropes (defended in his\n1990: Ch. 6; cf. also Von Wachter 2000) and Simons\u2019\n\u2018nuclear\u2019 theory of tropes and the scientific use he\ntentatively makes of it (Simons 1994; cf. also Morganti 2009\nand Wayne 2008).\n\nAccording to Campbell, the world is constituted by a rather limited\nnumber of field tropes which, according to our (current) best science,\nought to be identified with the fields of gravitation,\nelectromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces (plus a\nspacetime field). Standardly, these forces are understood as exerted\nby bodies that are not themselves fields. Not so on Campbell\u2019s\nview. Instead, matter is thought of as spread out and as present in\nvarious strengths across a region without any sharp boundaries to its\nlocation. What parts of the mass field we choose to focus on will be\nto a certain degree arbitrary. A zone in which several fields all\nsharply increase their intensity will likely be taken as one single\nentity or particle. But given the overall framework, individuals of\nthis kind are to be viewed as \u201cwell-founded appearances\u201d\n(Campbell 1990: 151).\n\nCampbell\u2019s views have been criticized by e.g., Christina\nSchneider (2006). According to Schneider, the field ontology proposed\nby Campbell (and by Von Wachter) fails, because the notion of a field\nwith which they seem to be working, is not mathematically\n rigorous.[35]\n And Matteo Morganti who, just like Campbell, wants to identify tropes\nwith entities described by quantum physics, finds several problems\nwith the identifications actually made by Campbell. He proposes\ninstead that we follow Simons and identify the basic constituents of\nreality with the fundamental particles, understood as bundles of\ntropes (Morganti 2009). If we take the basic properties described by\nthe Standard Model as fundamental tropes, is the idea, then the\nconstitution of particles out of more elementary constituents can be\nreadily reconstructed (possibly by using the sheaf-theoretical\nframework proposed by Mormann 1995, or the algebraic framework\nsuggested by Fuhrmann 1991).\n4.6 Tropes and Issues in Moral Philosophy\n\nRelatively little has so far been written on the topic of tropes in\nrelation to issues in moral philosophy and value theory. Two things\nhave however been argued. First, that tropes (and not, as is more\ncommonly supposed, objects or persons or states of affairs) are the\nbearers of final value. Second, that moral non-naturalists (who hold\nthat moral facts are fundamentally autonomous from natural facts) must\nregard properties as tropes to be able to account for the\nsupervenience of the moral on the natural.\n\nThat tropes are the bearers of (final) value is a view held by several\ntrope theorists. To say that what we value are the particular\nproperties of things and persons is prima facie\nintuitive (Williams 1953a: 16). And since concrete\nparticulars\u2014but not tropes\u2014are sometimes the subjects of\nsimultaneous yet conflicting evaluations, tropes seem\nespecially suited for the job as (final) value-bearers\n(Campbell 1997 [1981]: 130\u2013131). That tropes are the\nonly bearers of final value has however been questioned.\nAccording to Rabinowicz and R\u00f8nnow-Rasmussen (2003), this is\nbecause different pro-attitudes are fitting with respect to different\nkinds of valuable objects. However, according to Olson (2003), even if\nthis is so, it does not show that tropes are not the only bearers of\nfinal value. For that conclusion only follows if we assume that, to\nwhat we direct our evaluative attitude is indicative of where value is\nlocalized. But final value should be understood strictly as the value\nsomething has for its own sake, which means that if e.g., a\nperson is valuable because of her courage, then she is not valuable\nfor her own sake but is valuable, rather, for the sake of one of her\nproperties (i.e., her tropes). But this means that, although the\nevaluative attitude may well be directed at a person or a thing, the\nperson or thing is nevertheless valued because of, or for the sake of,\nthe tropes which characterize it.\n\nNon-naturalists, next, are often charged with not being able to\nexplain what appears to be a necessary dependence of moral facts on\nnatural facts. Normally this dependence is explained in terms of\nsupervenience, but in order for such an account to be compatible with\nthe basic tenets of moral non-naturalism, it has been argued, this\nsupervenience must, in turn, be explainable in purely non-naturalistic\nterms (for an overview of this debate, cf. Ridge 2018).\nAccording to Shafer-Landau (2003) (as interpreted by Ridge 2007) this\nproblem is solved if moral and physical properties in the sense of\nkinds, are distinguished from moral and physical properties in the\nsense of tokens, or tropes. For then we can say, in analogy with what\nhas been suggested in the debate on the causal relevance of mental\nproperties, that although (necessarily) every moral trope is\nconstituted by some concatenation of natural tropes, it does not\nfollow that every moral type is identical to a natural type. This\nsuggestion is criticized in Ridge (2007).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Ackrill, J.
