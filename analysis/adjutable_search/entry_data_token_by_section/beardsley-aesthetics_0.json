    "main_text": "Background\n1. Background\n\nIn Aesthetics, Beardsley develops a philosophy of art that is\nsensitive to three things:\n\nart itself and people\u2019s pre-philosophical interest in and\nopinions about art,\ncritics\u2019 pronouncements about art, and\ndevelopments in philosophy, especially, though not exclusively,\nthose in the analytic tradition.\n\n\nMore than anyone else, Beardsley took a love of the arts, independent\nof overarching philosophical commitments, seriously, and tried to make\nsense of it. Although he didn\u2019t automatically defer to\npre-reflective opinion about or interest in art, he, like Aristotle,\nthought they deserved respect\u00a0and balked at any philosophy of art\nthat didn\u2019t make contact with them, or cavalierly dismissed or\noverrode them. His was a philosophy of art based on a love of the\narts\u2014that, and not a love of philosophy or any agenda,\npsychological, political, religious, philosophical, or otherwise. The\ncopious examples and discussions of individual works of art in his\nwritings illustrate as much, as do his philosophical arguments and\nconclusions. Much the same can be said of his concern with, and\nrespect for, but far from automatic deference to, the remarks of art\ncritics.\n\nThe historical backdrop against which Beardsley developed his\nphilosophy of art in the late 1940s and early 1950s includes the three\nelements mentioned at the beginning of the preceding paragraph. There\nwere developments in the arts\u2014new forms in music, painting, and\nliterature had appeared and were appearing\u2014but there was also a\nwell-established and relatively large canon of works almost\nuniversally regarded as aesthetically superior and worthy of\nattention. Art criticism had become an industry, with major schools of\nall sorts flourishing: Marxist, Formalist, psychoanalytic, semiotic,\nhistorical, biographical. And philosophy had changed in rapid and\nunexpected ways. Analytic philosophy, with its emphasis on language\nand strong empiricist tendencies, had gained ascendancy in American\nuniversities in little more than 20 years, and dominated the\nphilosophical scene.\n\nBeardsley responded to each of the three. His position on developments\nin the arts is probably best described as open-minded moderation. He\nwelcomed new developments, and reference to new works and works that\nlack the luster of fame, notoriety, or ready recognition appear\nfrequently in Aesthetics and his other work. He didn\u2019t\nautomatically embrace the latest fad, fashion, or movement, however,\nbut tried, as he said, to get something out of a work. Failing that, a\nwork could be ignored, though tentatively and perhaps\ntemporarily\u2014the fault might be his and not the object\u2019s,\nhe always thought. Certainly, though, the well-established works of\nthe Western tradition\u2014the Bachs, Goyas, and Popes\u2014had to\nbe respected and accounted for in any philosophy of art worthy of the\nname.\n\nAs for art criticism, Beardsley thought that a great deal of it read\nlike the ruminations of a batter who kept his eyes on the scoreboard,\nthe fans, his contract, his place in history, or his wife in the\nstands\u2014instead of on the ball. Much of it, in other words,\nignored what should be the main object of attention, the work itself.\nThe school of criticism that attracted Beardsley, and that his\nphilosophy of art ultimately underwrites, is the so-called New\nCriticism. Based in literature, the New Criticism made the literary\nwork the center of critical attention, and denied, or at least greatly\ndevaluated, the relevance of facts about the origin of literary works,\ntheir effects upon individual readers, and their personal, social, and\npolitical influence. Close reading is what is required of a critic,\nnot biographical information about the author, a rundown of the state\nof society at the time the work was written, data about the psychology\nof creation, predictions about the effects of the work on society, and\ncertainly not a piece of autobiography detailing the critic\u2019s\nown personal response to the work. New Critics were explicators more\nthan anything else, and investigated literary works, and especially\npoetry, as if they were found objects\u2014worthwhile ores, rare\njewels, and mundane rocks, each with its own unique properties. As an\nexpert assayer, the critic must thoroughly and sensitively examine the\nobjects before him in order to discover their exact nature and, in the\nbest cases, special value. The rallying cry, in Allen Tate\u2019s\nwords, was, \u201cWe must return to, we must never leave, the poem\nitself\u201d (Tate 1955, 63). Much the same sentiment is expressed in\nBeardsley\u2019s remark that \u201c[the critic\u2019s] task is to\nkeep [his] eye on\u2026 textual meaning\u201d (PC: 34). Though\nbased in literary criticism, the New Criticism could be, and should\nbe, extended to the other arts, Beardsley thought: all art criticism\nshould make a serious effort to recognize its objects as special,\nautonomous, and important in their own right, and not subservient to\nulterior aims or values; all art criticism should attempt to\nunderstand how works of art work\u00a0and what meanings and aesthetic\nproperties they have; all art criticism should strive for objective\nand publicly accessible methods and standards to test its\npronouncements. The New Criticism did just that, and did what other\ncriticism, and especially Romantic criticism (in a broad sense of the\nterm), did not: studiously focused on the work of art itself, as an\nobject existing in its own right, with its own properties. Far too\nmuch criticism was essentially Romantic, the New Critics thought, and\nconcentrated on the artist, not the art.\n\nDevelopments in philosophy were a different story. In general, the\nphilosophy of art has always been regarded as a backwater by\nphilosophers, as by far the least rigorous and least important of the\nmajor branches of the field (a sentiment that remains widespread\ntoday), but the low regard in which aesthetics was held was even more\npronounced at the time that Beardsley began work on\nAesthetics. In its early, palmy days, analytic philosophy\ntended toward logical positivism, which dismissed judgments of\naesthetic value\u2014the core of art criticism, in Beardsley\u2019s\nestimation\u2014as cognitively meaningless, and ordinary language\nphilosophy, a species of analytic philosophy that flourished briefly\nafter World War Two, was unsystematic in its treatment of problems and\neven anti-systematic in its objectives\u2014strong philosophical\ntheses were either verboten, a sign of mistake, or an aberration.\nNeither brand of analytic philosophy boded well for aesthetics as a\nsystematic field of study. There was, however, also a general form of\nanalytic philosophy not connected with either approach, that is,\nanalytic philosophy without an overarching commitment to the scientism\nof logical positivism or the dogged adherence to everyday language of\nordinary language philosophy. Philosophers like Bertrand Russell, G.E.\nMoore, and C.D. Broad, among many others, were analysts without an\nagenda, and Beardsley was more in their camp\u2014that is, no\ndefinite camp of analytic philosophy at all\u2014than anyone\nelse\u2019s. For him, an analytic approach to the philosophy of art\nmeant no more than critically examining the fundamental concepts and\nbeliefs underlying art and art criticism. Doing philosophy of that\nsort required clarity, precision, and a good eye for identifying,\nexposing, and evaluating arguments, but left aesthetics, as a\nsystematic study, as a real possibility.\n",
