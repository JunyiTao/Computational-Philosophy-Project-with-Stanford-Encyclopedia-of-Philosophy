Reductionism and Holism in Medicine\n\nAs in many fields, debates over reductionism versus holism are rife in\nmedicine both with reference to medical research and practice, and the\nterms often are used rather loosely to mean a range of things (for a\nrelated discussion see entry on\n  reductionism in biology).\n In the broadest terms, reductionistic approaches to disease look for\nfundamental mechanisms or processes that are the underlying causes of\nthat disease. In recent years in light of large-scale genomic\nsequencing initiatives notably the Human Genome Project, there has\nbeen considerable emphasis on reducing diseases to the genetic or\nmolecular level. Those who advocate more holistic approaches note that\nreductionism leaves out important information based on the\npatient\u2019s experiences of the disease at the phenotypic level,\nand such information is critical to pursuit of effective treatments.\nMany diseases typically viewed as \u201cgenetic\u201d have proven to\nbe extremely difficult in practice to reduce to unified disease\nentities with singular (or simple) genetic causes, including mental\nillnesses (Harris and Schaffner 1992), cystic fibrosis (Ankeny 2002),\nand Alzheimer\u2019s disease (Dekkers and Rikkert 2008). As Catherine\nDekeuwer (2015) notes, given that there probably is genetic variation\nin susceptibility to virtually all diseases, there is no clear\ndemarcation between genetic diseases and diseases for which there are\ngenetic risk factors; hence she argues that our tendency to focus on\ngenetic determinants of disease may reinforce folk notions of the\ngeneticization of both people and of human behavior.\n\nWith regard to research, critics of reductionism point out that there\nhas been an overemphasis on the pursuit of genetic or molecular level\nexplanations of disease to the neglect of alternative levels of\nexplanation. Further, such limitations are highly detrimental to\npatients, especially because there are not likely to be short-term\ncures or treatments for most genetic diseases, perhaps beyond avoiding\nhaving children carrying particular genes in the first instance (see for instance \nHubbard and Wald 1999), although this domain of medicine is\nrapidly changing as new treatments are developed and the\nunderstandings of the effects of genomic mutations improve. Focusing\noverly or solely on the genetic level results in a process which the\nsociologist Abby Lippmann (1991) terms \u201cgeneticization\u201d,\nnamely reducing the differences between individuals to their DNA, and\nin turn viewing genetics as the most promising approach to curing\ndisease, rather than viewing people and the illnesses that they suffer\nat a phenotypic and much more environmentally-situated level. In\naddition, as Elisabeth Lloyd (2002) argues, higher levels of social\norganization that are culturally sanctioned have unrecognized causal\neffects on health, and hence medical research should not be restricted\nsolely to the molecular level.\n\nFred Gifford (1990) claims that although all phenotypic traits are the result of an\ninteraction between genes and the environment within which they are\nexpressed, nonetheless it makes sense to distinguish certain traits as\n\u201cgenetic\u201d; he argues in terms of populations that if it is\ngenetic differences that make the differences in that trait variable\nin a given population, and if genetic traits can be individuated in a\nway that matches what some genetic factors cause specifically, then a\ntrait (including a disease trait) can be understood as genetic. Kelly\nSmith (1992) disputes this, noting that the second condition depends\non an extremely problematic distinction between causes (in this case\ngenes) and mere conditions (e.g., epigenetic factors). Lisa Gannett\n(1999) argues for a \u201cpragmatic\u201d account of genetic\nexplanation, claiming that when a disease is classed as\n\u201cgenetic\u201d, the reasons for singling out genes as causes\nover other conditions necessarily include pragmatic dimensions\ninasmuch as they are relative to a given causal background (which\nincludes both genetic and nongenetic factors), relative to a\npopulation, and relative to our present state of knowledge. More\nrecently it has been argued that although explanatory reduction cannot\nbe defended on metaphysical grounds, reductive explanations might be\nindispensable ways to address certain questions in the most accurate,\nadequate, and efficient ways (van Bouwel et al. 2011).\n",
