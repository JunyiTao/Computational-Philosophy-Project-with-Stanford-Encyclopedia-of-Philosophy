    "main_text": "Proof Theory: A New Subject\n1. Proof Theory: A New Subject \n\nHilbert viewed the axiomatic method as the crucial tool for\nmathematics (and rational discourse in general). In a talk to the\nSwiss Mathematical Society in 1917, published the following year as\nAxiomatisches Denken (1918), he articulates his broad\nperspective on that method and presents it \u201cat work\u201d by\nconsidering, in detail, examples from various parts of mathematics and\nalso from physics. Proceeding axiomatically is not just developing a\nsubject in a rigorous way from first principles, but rather requires,\nfor advanced subjects, their deeper conceptual organization and\nserves, for newer investigations, as a tool for discovery. In his talk\nHilbert reflects on his investigations of the arithmetic of real\nnumbers and of Euclidean geometry from before 1900. We emphasize the\nparticular form of his axiomatic formulations; they are not logical\nformulations, but rather mathematical ones: he defines Euclidean space\nin a similar way as other abstract notions like group or field;\nthat\u2019s why we call it structural\n axiomatics.[1]\n However, Hilbert turns from the past and looks to the future,\npointing out a programmatic direction for research in the\nfoundations of mathematics; he writes:\n\n\nTo conquer this field [concerning the foundations of mathematics] we\nmust turn the concept of a specifically mathematical proof itself into\nan object of investigation, just as the astronomer considers the\nmovement of his position, the physicist studies the theory of his\napparatus, and the philosopher criticizes reason itself.\n\n\nHe then asserts, \u201cThe execution of this program is at present\nstill an unsolved task\u201d. During the following winter term\n1917\u201318, Hilbert\u2014with the assistance of Paul\nBernays\u2014gave a lecture course entitled Prinzipien der\nMathematik. Here modern mathematical logic is invented in one\nfell swoop and completes the shift from structural to formal\naxiomatics. This dramatic shift allows the constructive, elementary\ndefinition of the syntax of theories and, in particular, of the\nconcept of proof in a formal theory. This fundamental insight\nunderpins the articulation of the consistency problem and seems to\nopen a way of proving, meta-mathematically, that no proof in a formal\ntheory establishes a contradiction.\n\nThat perspective is formulated first in a talk Bernays presented in\nthe fall of 1921, published as \u201c\u00dcber Hilberts Gedanken zur\nGrundlegung der Mathematik\u201d (1922). Starting with a discussion\nof structural axiomatics and pointing out its assumption of a\nsystem of objects that satisfies the axioms, he asserts this\nassumption contains \u201csomething so-to-speak transcendent for\nmathematics\u201d. He raises the question, \u201cwhich principled\nposition should be taken with respect to it?\u201d Bernays believes\nthat it might be perfectly coherent to appeal to an intuitive\ngrasp of the natural number sequence or even of the manifold of real\nnumbers. However, that could not be an intuition in any primitive\nsense and would conflict with the tendency of the exact sciences to\nuse only restricted means to acquire knowledge.\n\n\nUnder this perspective we are going to try, whether it is not possible\nto give a foundation to these transcendent assumptions in such a way\nthat only primitive intuitive knowledge is used. (Bernays 1922:\n11)\n\n\nMeaningful mathematics is to be based, Bernays demands, on primitive\nintuitive knowledge that includes, however, induction concerning\nnatural numbers\u2014both as a proof and definition principle. In the\noutline for the lectures Grundlagen der Mathematik to be\ngiven in the winter term 1921\u201322, Bernays discusses a few weeks\nafter his talk \u201cconstructive arithmetic\u201d and then the\n\u201cbroader formulation of constructive thought\u201d:\n\n\nConstruction of the proofs, by means of which the formalization of the\nhigher inferences is made possible and the consistency problem is\nbecoming accessible in a general way. \n\n\nBernays concludes the outline by suggesting, \u201cThis would be\nfollowed by the development of proof theory\u201d. The outline was\nsent to Hilbert on 17 October 1921 and it was followed strictly in the\nlectures of the following term\u2014with only one terminological\nchange: \u201cconstructive\u201d in the above formulations is turned\ninto\n \u201cfinitist\u201d.[2]\n\n\nBernays\u2019s notes of the 1921/22 lectures reflect the consequence\nof that change in attitude. They contain a substantial development of\n\u201cfinitist arithmetic\u201d and \u201cfinitist logic\u201d in\na quantifier-free formalism. Finitist arithmetic involves induction\nand primitive\n recursion[3]\n from the outset, and the central metamathematical arguments all\nproceed straightforwardly by induction on proof figures. The third\npart of these lectures is entitled The grounding of the\nconsistency of arithmetic by Hilbert\u2019s new proof theory.\nHere we find the first significant consistency proof\u2014from a\nfinitist\n perspective.[4]\n The proof is sketched in Hilbert\u2019s Leipzig talk (Hilbert 1923:\n184) and was presented in a modified form during the winter term of\n1922/23; in that form the proof is given in Ackermann 1925: 4\u20137.\nAckermann\u2019s article was submitted for publication in early 1924,\nand by then the proof had taken on a certain canonical form that is\nstill found in the presentation of Hilbert and Bernays 1934:\n220\u2013230. Let us see what was achieved by following\nAckermann\u2019s concise discussion.\n",
