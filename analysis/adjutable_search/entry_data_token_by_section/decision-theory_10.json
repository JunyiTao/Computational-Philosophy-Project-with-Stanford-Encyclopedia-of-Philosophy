    "main_text": "Challenges to EU theory\n5. Challenges to EU theory\n\nThus far the focus has been on prominent versions of the standard\ntheory of rational choice: EU theory. This section picks up on some\nkey criticisms of EU theory that have been developed into alternative\naccounts of rational choice. The proposed innovations to the standard\ntheory are distinct and so are discussed separately, but they are not\nnecessarily mutually exclusive. Note that we do not address all\ncriticisms of EU theory that have inspired alternative accounts of\nrational choice. Two major omissions of this sort (for want of space\nand also because they have been thoroughly addressed in alternative\nentries of this encyclopedia) are i) the problem of causal anomalies\nand the development of causal decision theory (see the entry on\n causal decision theory),\n and ii) the problem of infinite state spaces and the development of\nalternatives like \u201crelative expectation theory\u201d (see the\nentries on\n normative theories of rational choice: expected utility theory\n and\n the St. Petersburg paradox).\n",
