    "main_text": "Further Possibilities\n4. Further Possibilities\n\nIn recent decades, the debate over the definition of death has\ngenerally been understood as a competition between the approaches\ndiscussed here: traditional, whole-brain (or brainstem), and\nhigher-brain standards and their corresponding conceptualizations.\nEach of these approaches, however, makes certain assumptions that\nmight be contested: (1) that death is more or less determinate, more\nevent-like than process-like, (2) that there is a uniquely correct\ndefinition of death, which can be formulated in terms of necessary and\njointly sufficient conditions, and (3) that human death is morally a\nvery important marker. Now we will consider three nonstandard ways of\nthinking about death, each of which directly challenges one of these\nassumptions.\n",
