    "main_text": "The Conservation Biology Framing || Introduction\n5.1 Introduction\n\nSarkar (2017: 43) summarises the basis for what might be called the\nconservation biology framing of \u201cbiodiversity\u201d:\n\n\nthe term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d and the associated concept(s) were\nintroduced in the context of the institutional establishment of\nconservation biology as an academic discipline\u2026.\n\n\nThe SEP\n conservation biology\n entry describes the motivation for a biodiversity framing tied to\nthis historical link: \u201cin the 1980s, conservation biologists\nunited and argued that biodiversity should be the focus of the\ndiscipline\u201d which \u201crests on the value assumption that\nbiodiversity is good and ought to be conserved\u201d. This rationale,\nhowever, was not linked to any clear idea of what\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d means:\n\n\nconservation biology as a discipline has expended a great deal of\nintellectual effort in articulating exactly what is its object of\nstudy and has settled on biodiversity as the answer. However, there is\na debate concerning what biodiversity is\u2026.\n\n\nHere, the stated rationale is that \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is\nnormative and is the focus of the discipline, but there is no\nreference to the pre-history discussions of a normatively relevant\ndefinition of biodiversity as variety.\n\nThe review of the development of the conservation biology, by Meine,\nSoule, and Noss. (2006), does trace some historical foundations. It\ndocuments the idea of a shift in thinking from individual species\nlosses to loss of the diversity of life. This shift is described\nnicely in comparing two editions (1959 and 1987) of the same book\n(Matthiessen 1987)\u2014where the 1987 version introduces new\nemphasis on the loss of \u201cthe diversity of\n life\u201d.[2]\n\nSarkar (2017) notes that ecological diversity indices were largely\nignored in the early history of conservation biology. In contrast,\nMeine, Soule, and Noss. (2006) frequently used the term\n\u201cdiversity\u201d, This perhaps reflected co-author Noss\u2019s\n(1990) much-cited paper characterising biodiversity as including\ncomposition, structure, and function, which echoes the range of\n\u201cdiversity\u201d measures in ecology. The unlimited\npossibilities of such diversity measures may have contributed to the\ndifficulty in finding agreement on a single definition of\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d. The conservation biology framing thus\ngains justification in embracing the prospect of\n\u201cworking-backwards\u201d, with the challenge to define\n\u201cbiodiversity\u201d to capture those aspects of\nbiological/conservation normative value.\n\nHow then is \u201cbiodiversity\u201d to be defined under these\nassumptions? The next two sections review the important discussions\nabout the definition of biodiversity, and the later arguments that the\ndefinitional problems mean that the term \u201cbiodiversity\u201d is\ncounter-productive and should be abandoned.\n",
