One of the main areas interested in the methods for\ncombining logics is software specification. Certain techniques for\ncombining logics were developed almost exclusively with the aim of\napplying them to this area. In this section some of these methods will\nbe briefly mentioned: temporalization,\nparameterization and institutions.\n\nTemporalization was introduced in Finger and Gabbay 1992 (see also\nFinger and Gabbay 1996), and generalized in Caleiro et al. 1999\ntowards the method called parameterization.\n\nParameterization, in rough terms, consists of replacing the atomic\npart of a given logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) by another logic \\({{\\cal L}}'\\).\nThus, the logic \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is the parameterized logic;\nthe atomic part is the formal parameter and the logic\n\\({{\\cal L}}'\\) is the parameter logic. Formally, a mixed\nsignature based on the signature of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) is considered, to\nwhich the formulas of \\({{\\cal L}}'\\) are added as constants. In the\nparticular case of temporalization, the parameter logic is a temporal\nlogic. In turn, it can be proven that parameterization is a particular\ncase of constrained fibring (recall\n subsection 4.3).\n\nThe method can be explained by means of a simple example taken from\nCarnielli et al. 2008: consider a propositional modal logic \\({{\\cal\nL}}\\), to be parameterized with first-order logic \\({{\\cal L}}_{fol}\\)\nin order to describe the dynamics of data bases. The resulting logic\nis defined in a language whose formulas are obtained by replacing\npropositional constants in formulas of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) by first-order\nformulas. That is, modalities can be freely used, but quantifiers\ncannot be applied to modal formulas (other propositional connectives\nsuch as negation and implication are shared).\n\nThe semantic structures for the new logic are Kripke structures where\nthe valuation for propositional constants is replaced by a kind of\n\u201czooming in\u201d mapping (in the sense of Blackburn and de\nRijke 1997) associating a first-order semantic structure together with\na fixed assignment for individual variables to each state.\n\nThe deductive system for the new logic is formed by the rules of both\nlogics. The rules of \\({{\\cal L}}\\) can be instantiated with formulas\nof the parameterized language, but the rules of first-order logic can\nonly be applied to pure first-order formulas.\n\nOne important difference between parameterization (in particular,\ntemporalization) and constrained fibring is the degree of symmetry:\nthe parameterized language and inference rules are intrinsically\nasymmetric, while this is not the case of constrained fibring.\n\nInstitutions were introduced by J. Goguen and R. Burstall (see Goguen\nand Burstall 1984, 1992) as a kind of \u201cabstract model\ntheory\u201d for Computer Science, and are adequate for developing\nconcepts of specification languages such as structuring of\nspecifications and implementation.\n\nThe theory of institutions is mainly applicable to software\nspecification defined by multiple logical systems (see, for instance,\nDiaconescu and Futatsugi 2002). Thus, under an abstract view of\nsoftware development, different components of the same program can be\nspecified using different formalism in an heterogeneous setting. This\nis formalized by the use of institutions and morphisms between them\n(see, for instance, Tarlecki 2000). A problem concerning institution\nmorphisms is that formulas involving connectives from different logics\nbeing combined are not allowed. A solution to this problem was\nproposed in Goguen and Burstall 1986 and Mossakowski 1996, by using\nthe so-called parchments and parchment\nmorphisms.\n",
