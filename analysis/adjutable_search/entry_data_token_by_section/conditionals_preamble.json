    "main_text": "\n\nTake a sentence in the indicative mood, suitable for making a\nstatement: \u201cWe\u2019ll be home by ten\u201d, \u201cTom cooked\nthe dinner\u201d. Attach a conditional clause to it, and you have a\nsentence which makes a conditional statement: \u201cWe\u2019ll be\nhome by ten if the train is on time\u201d, \u201cIf Mary\ndidn\u2019t cook the dinner, Tom cooked it\u201d. A conditional\nsentence \u201cIf \\(A, C\\)\u201d or \u201c\\(C\\) if \\(A\\)\u201d\nthus has two contained sentences or sentence-like clauses. \\(A\\) is\ncalled the antecedent, \\(C\\) the consequent. If you understand \\(A\\)\nand \\(C\\), and you have mastered the conditional construction (as we\nall do at an early age), you understand \u201cIf \\(A, C\\)\u201d.\nWhat does \u201cif\u201d mean? Consulting the dictionary yields\n\u201con condition that; provided that; supposing that\u201d. These\nare adequate synonyms. But we want more than synonyms. A theory of\nconditionals aims to give an account of the conditional construction\nwhich explains when conditional judgements are acceptable, which\ninferences involving conditionals are good inferences, and why this\nlinguistic construction is so important. Despite intensive work of\ngreat ingenuity, this remains a highly controversial subject. \n",
