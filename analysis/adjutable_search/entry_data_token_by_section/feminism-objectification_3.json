    "main_text": "Objectivity and Objectification\n4. Objectivity and Objectification\n\nMacKinnon introduces the idea that there are important connections\nbetween objectivity and objectification. MacKinnon writes: \u201cThe\nstance of the \u2018knower\u2019 \u2026 is \u2026 the neutral\nposture, which I will be calling objectivity\u2014that is the\nnonsituated distanced standpoint\u2026 [This] is the male standpoint\nsocially \u2026 [The] relationship between objectivity as the stance\nfrom which the world is known and the world that is apprehended in\nthis way is the relationship of objectification. Objectivity is the\nepistemological stance of which objectification is the social process,\nof which male dominance is the politics, the acted out social\npractice. That is, to look at the world objectively is to objectify\nit\u201d (MacKinnon 1987, 50). Her claim has become the focus of\nrecent feminist investigation. Drawing on MacKinnon\u2019s work, Rae\nLangton and Sally Haslanger have explored the idea that\nobjectification is often hidden, and \u2018masked\u2019 as\nobjectivity.\n\nAccording to Haslanger, in trying to be objective about our world and\nfunction within it, we go about trying to discover things\u2019\nnatures. An object\u2019s nature is essential to it, and any change\nto it will inevitably destroy it. An object cannot exist without those\nproperties that constitute its nature. Discovering an object\u2019s\nnature enables us to explain the behaviour of that object under normal\ncircumstances. This means that in practical decision-making, we must\nbe attentive to objects\u2019 natures (Haslanger 1993, 103, 105). She\nwrites: \u201cIt won\u2019t do to try to fry an egg on a paper\nplate; there is no point in trying to teach a rock how to read.\nBecause the world is not infinitely malleable to our wants or needs,\nreasonable decision making will accommodate \u2018how things\nare\u2019, where this is understood as accommodating the natures of\nthings, the background conditions constraining our actions\u201d\n(Haslanger 1993, 105).\n\nA plausible strategy for discovering a thing\u2019s nature is to look\nfor observed regularities. This is because natures are responsible for\nthe regular behaviour of things under normal circumstances. For\nexample, I observe that my ferns die if deprived of water. I therefore\ncome to believe that the nature of ferns is such that they cannot\nsurvive without water. I adjust my decision-making in accordance with\nthis observed regularity, and so water my ferns to prevent them from\ndying. In observing the regularity that ferns die when depraved of\nwater, I have concluded that this is due to ferns\u2019 nature.\nHaslanger points out that this procedure of drawing on observed\nregularities to set constraints on our practical decision making seems\nto be \u201ca paradigm of \u2018neutral,\u2019\n\u2018objective,\u2019 or \u2018reasonable\u2019 procedure\u201d\n(Haslanger 1993, 105).\n\nThe above procedure, however, can be problematic. This becomes obvious\nwhen moving to the social world. For example, aiming to discover\nwomen\u2019s nature following the above procedure in patriarchal\nsocieties (like ours, according to MacKinnon) is highly problematic.\nMacKinnon believes that it is an observed regularity in our societies\nthat women are submissive and object-like (and men are women\u2019s\nobjectifiers). This means that one might be led to the belief that\nwomen are by their nature submissive and object-like. (It\nshould be noted here that MacKinnon, and also Haslanger and Langton\nfollowing her, use \u2018men\u2019 and \u2018women\u2019 to refer\nto gender categories, which are socially (not biologically) defined:\none is a woman or a man by virtue of one\u2019s social position; see\nthe entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.)\n However, the belief that women are naturally submissive and\nobject-like is false, since women have been made to be like\nthat.\n\nWomen\u2019s object-like status is not a natural fact, but rather a\nconsequence of gender inequality. In structuring our world in such a\nway as to accommodate this allegedly natural fact about women, we\nsustain the existing situation of gender inequality. As MacKinnon\nvividly puts it: \u201cif [we] look neutrally on the reality of\ngender so produced, the harm that has been done will not be\nperceptible as harm. It becomes just the way things are\u201d\n(MacKinnon 1987, 59). Haslanger adds: \u201cOnce we have cast women\nas submissive and deferential \u2018by nature\u2019, then efforts to\nchange this role appear unmotivated, even pointless. \u2026 These\nreflections suggest that what appeared to be a \u2018neutral\u2019\nor \u2018objective\u2019 ideal, namely, the procedure of drawing on\nobserved regularities to set constraints on practical decision\nmaking\u2014is one which will, under conditions of gender hierarchy\nreinforce the social arrangements on which such hierarchy\ndepends\u201d (Haslanger 1993, 106).\n\nDrawing on MacKinnon, Haslanger suggests that there are four\nconditions that are necessary in order for person A to\nobjectify person B:\n\nPerson A views and treats person B as\nan object for the satisfaction of A\u2019s desire;\nWhere person A desires person B to have\nsome property, A forces B to have that\nproperty;\nPerson A believes that person B has\nthat property;\nPerson A believes that person B has that\nproperty by nature (Haslanger 1993, 102\u20133).\n\n\nWhen it comes to women\u2019s sexual objectification by men, the\nabove conditions go as following:\n\nMen view and treat women as objects of male\nsexual desire;\nMen desire women to be submissive and object-like and\nforce them to submit;\nMen believe that women are in fact submissive and\nobject-like;\nMen believe that women are in fact submissive and\nobject-like by nature.\n\n\nAccording to Haslanger, in order for an objectifier to\n\u2018mask\u2019 his power and believe that the observed differences\nbetween men and women are consequences of their natures, he must\nresort to a norm of aperspectivity; he must believe that his\nobservations are not conditioned by his own social position, and that\nhe has no impact on the circumstances under observation. Haslanger\ndiscusses a norm, which is often used by objectifiers, the norm of\nAssumed Objectivity, which consists of the following four\nsub-norms:\n\nEpistemic neutrality: one must take a genuine regularity\nin the behaviour of something to be a consequence of its nature.\nPractical neutrality: one must constrain one\u2019s\ndecision making to accommodate things\u2019 natures.\nAbsolute aperspectivity: one must count observed\nregularities as \u201cgenuine\u201d when: (i) observations occur\nunder normal circumstances, (ii) observations are not conditioned by\nthe observer\u2019s social position, (iii) the observer has not\ninfluenced the behaviour of items under observation.\nAssumed aperspectivity: one must believe that any\nregularity one observes is a \u201cgenuine\u201d regularity, and so\nreveals the nature of the things under observation (Haslanger 1993,\n106\u20137).\n\n\nHaslanger argues that, under conditions of social hierarchy, the Norm\nof Assumed Objectivity would perpetuate the existing patterns of\nwomen\u2019s objectification. Therefore, our efforts at social change\nwould become unmotivated. The norm in question should be rejected in\nthis case because it has bad practical consequences for women, while\nserving the interests of men (it is pragmatically bad).\nFurthermore, Haslanger argues that the norm of Assumed Objectivity\nshould be rejected because it yields false beliefs, like the belief\nthat women are submissive and object-like by their nature (it is\nepistemically bad) (Haslanger 1993, 108\u2013115).\n\nLangton agrees with Haslanger that, under conditions of social\nhierarchy, the norm of Assumed Objectivity is problematic and\ntherefore should be rejected. Her reasons are twofold: First of all,\n(as Haslanger also noted) because it yields false beliefs; beliefs\nwhich do not fit the world at all, like the belief that women are\nobject-like by nature. Secondly, because it yields true but\nunjustified beliefs, beliefs that are true \u201cfor the wrong\nreasons\u201d (Langton 1993, 383); for example, the belief that women\nare actually submissive and object-like. The belief is unjustified,\naccording to Langton, because of its direction of fit. In this case,\nLangton explains, instead of men arranging their belief to fit the\nworld, the world arranges itself to fit the belief of men. Those\npeople who occupy a position of power and pursue the norm of Assumed\nObjectivity will make the world conform to their belief (Langton 1993,\n383).\n\nLangton explains that objectivity is about the ways in which\nthe mind conforms to the world (the way in which our beliefs arrange\nthemselves to fit the world). When someone is objective, his or her\nbeliefs have the right direction of fit: the beliefs are arranged in\norder to fit the way the world is. Objectification, on the\nother hand, is about the ways in which the world conforms to mind\n(conforms to our beliefs). An objectifier\u2019s beliefs have the\nwrong direction of fit: the objectifier arranges the world in order to\nfit his or her beliefs, which are influenced by his or her desires,\ninstead of arranging his or her beliefs to fit the way the world\nactually is. Objectification, then, is a process in which the social\nworld comes to be shaped by desire and belief. An objectifier thinks\nthat her or his beliefs have come to fit the world, where in fact the\nworld has come to fit her or his beliefs.\n\nWhen it comes to the objectification of women, Langton explains that\nwomen become submissive and object-like because of men\u2019s desires\nand beliefs. Men desire women to be this way, and, if they have power,\nthey force women to become this way. Following the norm of Assumed\nObjectivity, then, men form the belief that women are in fact\nsubmissive and object-like, and also that women are like that due to\ntheir nature. So, when it comes to women\u2019s objectification, the\nworld conforms to men\u2019s minds. Men\u2019s beliefs, however,\nhave the wrong direction of fit because men arrange the world to fit\ntheir beliefs and desires about women being submissive and\nobject-like. The norm of Assumed Objectivity, then, yields the belief\nthat women are submissive and object-like, which is true but has the\nwrong direction of fit (Langton 2000, 138\u2013142), along with the\nfalse belief that women are naturally this way. (For a further\ndiscussion about beliefs with an anomalous direction of fit, as well\nas a discussion of the mechanisms that are responsible for generating\nthem, see also Langton\u2019s work on \u2018projection\u2019 and\nits role in women\u2019s objectification in her 2004 article\n\u201cProjection and Objectification\u201d. For a criticism of\nLangton\u2019s argument that the norm of Assumed Objectivity is\nresponsible for yielding beliefs that are true but have a wrong\ndirection of fit, see Papadaki 2008.)\n",
