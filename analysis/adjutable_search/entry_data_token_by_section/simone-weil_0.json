    "main_text": "Philosophical Development\n1. Philosophical Development\n\nSimone Weil was born in Paris on 3 February 1909. Her parents, both of\nwhom came from Jewish families, provided her with an assimilated,\nsecular, bourgeois French childhood that was cultured and comfortable.\nWeil and her older brother Andr\u00e9\u2014himself a math prodigy,\nfounder of the Bourbaki group, and a distinguished mathematician at\nthe Princeton Institute for Advanced Study\u2014studied at\nprestigious Parisian schools. Weil\u2019s first philosophy teacher,\nat the Lyc\u00e9e Victor-Duruy, was Ren\u00e9 Le Senne; it was he\nwho introduced her to the thesis\u2014which she would\nmaintain\u2014that contradiction is a theoretical obstacle generative\nof nuanced, alert thinking. Beginning in October 1925, Weil studied at\nHenri IV Lyc\u00e9e in preparation for the entrance exams of the\n\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. At Henri IV she studied under\nthe philosopher and essayist \u00c9mile-Auguste Chartier (known\npseudonymously as Alain), whose teacher was Jules Lagneau. Like Weil\nat this time, Alain was agnostic. In his classes he emphasized\nintellectual history: in philosophy this included Plato, Marcus\nAurelius, Descartes, Spinoza, and Kant, and in literature, Homer,\nAeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Already sympathetic with the\ndowntrodden and critical of French society, she gained the theoretical\ntools to levy critiques against her country and philosophical\ntradition in Alain\u2019s class. There, employing paradox and\nattention through the form of the essay (it is important to note that\nnone of her writings was published as a book in her lifetime), she\nbegan intentionally developing what would become her distinct mode of\nphilosophizing. It is therefore arguable that she is part of the\nAlain/Lagneau line of voluntarist, spiritueliste philosophy\nin France.\n\nIn 1928 Weil began her studies at the \u00c9cole Normale. She was\nthe only woman in her class, the first woman having been first\nadmitted in 1917. In 1929\u20131930 she worked on her dissertation on\nknowledge and perception in Descartes, and having received her\nagr\u00e9gation diploma, she served from late 1931 to\nmid-1934 as a teacher at lyc\u00e9es. Throughout this\nperiod, outside of her duties at each lyc\u00e9e where she\ninstructed professionally, Weil taught philosophy to, lobbied for, and\nwrote on behalf of workers\u2019 groups; at times, moreover, she\nherself joined in manual labor. In her early thinking she prized at\nonce the first-person perspective and radical skepticism of Descartes,\nthe class-based solidarity and materialist analysis of Marx, and the\nmoral absolutism and respect for the individual of Kant. Drawing from\neach, her early work can be read as an attempt to provide, with a view\ntoward liberty, her own analysis of the fundamental causes of\noppression in society.\n\nIn early August 1932, Weil travelled to Germany in order to understand\nbetter the conditions fostering Nazism. German trade unions, she wrote\nto friends upon her return to France, were the single force in Germany\nable to generate a revolution, but they were fully reformist. Long\nperiods of unemployment left many Germans without energy or esteem. At\nbest, she observed frankly, they could serve as a kind of dead weight\nin a revolution. More specifically, by early 1933 she criticized the\ntendency of social organizations to engender bureaucracy, which\nelevated management and collective thinking over and against the\nindividual worker. Against this tendency, she advocated for\nworkers\u2019 understanding the physical labor they performed within\nthe context of the whole organizational apparatus. In\n\u201cReflections Concerning the Causes of Liberty and Social\nOppression\u201d (1934), Weil presented both a summation of her early\nthought and a prefiguring of central elements in her thematic\ntrajectory. The essay employs a Marxian method of analysis that pays\nattention to the oppressed, critiques her own position as an\nintellectual, privileges manual labor, and demands precise and\nunorthodox individual thinking that unites theory and practice against\ncollective clich\u00e9s, propaganda, obfuscation, and\nhyper-specialization. These ideas would provide a theoretical\nframework for her idiosyncratic practice of philosophy. Near the end\nof her life she wrote in a notebook: \u201cPhilosophy (including\nproblems of cognition, etc.) is exclusively an affair of\naction and practice\u201d (FLN 362).\n\nOn 20 June, 1934, Weil applied for a sabbatical from teaching. She was\nto spend a year working in Parisian factories as part of its most\noppressed group, unskilled female laborers. Weil\u2019s \u201cyear\nof factory work\u201d (which amounted, in actuality, to around 24\nweeks of laboring) was not only important in the development of her\npolitical philosophy but can also be seen as a turning point in her\nslow religious evolution.\n\nIn Paris\u2019s factories, Weil began to see and to comprehend\nfirsthand the normalization of brutality in modern industry. There,\nshe wrote in her \u201cFactory Journal\u201d, \u201c[t]ime was an\nintolerable burden\u201d (FW 225) as modern factory work comprised\ntwo elements principally: orders from superiors and, relatedly,\nincreased speeds of production. While the factory managers continued\nto demand more, both fatigue and thinking (itself less likely under\nsuch conditions) slowed work. As a result, Weil felt dehumanized.\nPhenomenologically, her factory experience was less one of physical\nsuffering per se, and more one of humiliation. Weil was\nsurprised that this humiliation produced not rebellion but rather\nfatigue and docility. She described her experience in factories as a\nkind of \u201cslavery\u201d. On a trip to Portugal in August 1935,\nupon watching a procession to honor the patron saint of fishing\nvillagers, she had her first major contact with Christianity and wrote\nthat\n\n\nthe conviction was suddenly borne in upon [her] that Christianity is\npre-eminently the religion of slaves, that slaves cannot help\nbelonging to it, and [she] among others. (1942 \u201cSpiritual\nAutobiography\u201d in WFG 21\u201338, 26)\n\n\nIn comparison with her pre-factory \u201cTestament\u201d, we see\nthat in her \u201cFactory Journal\u201d Weil maintains the language\nof liberty, but she moves terminologically from\n\u201coppression\u201d to \u201chumiliation\u201d and\n\u201caffliction\u201d. Thus her conception and description of\nsuffering thickened and became more personal at this time.\n\nWeil participated in the 1936 Paris factory occupations and, moreover,\nplanned on returning to factory work. Her trajectory shifted, however,\nwith the advent of the Spanish Civil War. On the level of geopolitics,\nshe was critical of both civil and international war, and she approved\nof France\u2019s decision not to intervene on the Republican side. On\nthe level of individual commitment, however, she obtained\njournalist\u2019s credentials and joined an international anarchist\nbrigade. On 20 August, 1936, Weil, clumsy and nearsighted, stepped in\na pot of boiling oil, severely burning her lower left leg and instep.\nOnly her parents could persuade her not to return to combat. By late\n1936 Weil wrote against French colonization of Indochina, and by early\n1937 she argued against French claims to Morocco and Tunisia. In April\n1937 she travelled to Italy. Within the basilica Santa Maria degli\nAngeli, inside the small twelfth-century Romanesque chapel where St.\nFrancis prayed, Weil had her second significant contact with\nChristianity. As she would later describe in a letter,\n\u201c[S]omething stronger than I compelled me for the first time to\ngo down on my knees\u201d (WFG 26).\n\nFrom 1937\u20131938 Weil revisited her Marxian commitments, arguing\nthat there is a central contradiction in Marx\u2019s thought:\nalthough she adhered to his method of analysis and demonstration that\nthe modern state is inherently oppressive\u2014being that it is\ncomposed of the army, police, and bureaucracy\u2014she continued to\nreject any positing of revolution as immanent or determined. Indeed,\nin Weil\u2019s middle period, Marx\u2019s confidence in history\nseemed to her a worse ground for judgment than Machiavelli\u2019s\nemphasis on contingency.\n\nDuring the week of Easter 1938, Weil visited the Benedictine abbey of\nSolesmes from Palm Sunday to the following Tuesday. At Solesmes she\nhad her third contact with Christianity: suffering from headaches,\nWeil found a joy so pure in Gregorian chant that, by analogy, she\ngained an understanding\n\n\nof the possibility of living divine love in the midst of affliction.\nIt goes without saying that in the course of these services the\nthought of the passion of Christ entered into [her] being once and for\nall. (WFG 26)\n\n\nAt Solesmes, she was also introduced to the seventeenth century poet\nGeorge Herbert by a young Englishman she met there. She claimed to\nfeel Christ\u2019s presence while reciting Herbert\u2019s poem\n\u201cLove\u201d. As she fixed her full attention on the poem while\nsuffering from her most intense headache, Weil came to see that her\nrecitation had the virtue of prayer, saying, \u201cChrist himself\ncame down and took possession of me\u201d (WFG 27). Importantly, she\nthought God \u201cin his mercy\u201d had prevented her from reading\nthe mystics until that point; therefore, she could not say that she\ninvented her unexpected contact with Christ (WFG 27). These events and\nwritings in 1936\u20131938 exemplify the mutually informing nature of\nsolidarity and spirituality in Weil\u2019s thought that began in\nAugust 1935.\n\nAfter the military alliance of Germany and Italy in May 1939, Weil\nrenounced her pacifism. It was not that she felt she was wrong in\nholding such a position before, but rather that now, she argued,\nFrance was no longer strong enough to remain generous or merely\ndefensive. Following the German Western offensive, she left Paris with\nher family in June 1940, on the last train. They settled eventually\nbut temporarily in Marseilles, at the time the main gathering point\nfor those attempting to flee France, and where Weil would work with\nthe Resistance.\n\nIn Vichy France Weil took up a practice she had long sought, namely,\nto apprentice herself to the life of agricultural laborers. In\naddition, in Marseilles she was introduced to the Dominican priest\nJoseph-Marie Perrin, who became a close friend as well as a spiritual\ninterlocutor, and through whom she began to consider the question of\nbaptism. In an effort to help Weil find a job as an agricultural\nlaborer, Perrin turned to his friend Gustave Thibon, a Catholic writer\nwho owned a farm in the Ard\u00e9che region. Thus in Fall 1941 Weil\nworked in the grape harvest. Importantly, however, she was not treated\nlike the rest of the laborers; although she worked a full eight hours\nper day, she resided and ate at the house of her employers. She\nreportedly carried Plato\u2019s Symposium with her in the\nvineyards and attempted to teach the text to her fellow laborers.\n\nIn 1942 Weil agreed to leave France in part so her parents would be in\na safe place (they would not leave without her, she knew), but\nprincipally because she thought she might be more useful for\nFrance\u2019s war effort if she were in another country. Thus she\nwent to New York via Morocco. In New York, as in Marseilles, she\nfilled notebook after notebook with philosophical, theological, and\nmathematical considerations. New York, however, felt removed from the\nsufferings of her native France; the Free French movement in London\nfelt one step closer to returning to France. In 1943 Weil was given a\nsmall office at 19 Hill Street in London. From this room she would\nwrite day and night for the next four months, sleeping around three\nhours each night. Her output in this period totaled around 800 printed\npages, but she resigned from the Free French movement in late July\n(P\u00e9trement 1973 [1976: xx]).\n\nWeil died Tuesday, 24 August 1943. Three days later, the coroner\npronounced her death a suicide\u2014cardiac failure from\nself-starvation and tuberculosis. The accounts provided by her\nbiographers tell a more complex story: Weil was aware that her fellow\ncountry-men and women in the occupied territory had to live on minimal\nfood rations at this time, and she had insisted on the same for\nherself, which exacerbated her physical illness to the point of death\n(Von der Ruhr 2006: 18). On 30 August she was buried at\nAshford\u2019s New Cemetery between the Jewish and the Catholic\nsections. Her grave was originally anonymous. For fifteen years\nAshford residents thought it was a pauper\u2019s.\n",
