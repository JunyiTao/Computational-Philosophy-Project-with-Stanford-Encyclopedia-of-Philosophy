Raymond Delassus, Sanches\u2019 disciple, and first\nbiographer, dates the letter to around 1575, while J. Iriarte believes\nthat the latter was written much later, in 1589, in which case it\nwould place the writing of the letter at least eight years after the\npublication of Quo nihil scitur (1581). Given, however, that\nClavius\u2019 translation and commentary on Euclid\u2019s\nElements was published in Rome in 1574, it would seem that\nthe former date of 1575, makes much more sense. It stands to reason\nthat Sanches would have responded to Clavius\u2019 commentary soon\nafter its publication rather than fifteen years later, especially when\nso much of what is in the letter is implicitly related to\nSanches\u2019 epistemology in Quod nihil scitur. In that\nsense the Letter to Clavius constitutes a debate between those who\nlike Clavius believed that the truths of mathematics were a\npriori and indubitable, and thinkers like Sanches who held an\nanti-Platonist, empiricist view of the world. A few quotes from\nClavius\u2019 Opera mathematica and from Sanches\u2019s\nLetter help us to understand the debate. Clavius wrote:\n\n\nSince the mathematical disciplines treat things which are considered\nwithout any sensible matter (although they are actually impressed in\nmatter), it is clear that they occupy the intermediate place between\nmetaphysics and natural science\u2026If the nobility and preeminence\nof a science is truly judged by virtue of the certainty of the\ndemonstrations it uses, undoubtedly the mathematical disciplines will\noccupy the first place among all. (quoted in Sasaki 2003: 56)\n\n\nBy the time that Descartes wrote the Meditations,\nClavius\u2019 view concerning what he called the\n\u201cpreeminence\u201d of mathematics was generally accepted. It\nwas the prevailing view that something like Euclid\u2019s theorems\nwere time-tested to be demonstrably true. And indeed it was for this\nreason that Mersenne suggested to Descartes that he present his\narguments in his Second Replies in geometrical fashion, in the form of\nDefinitions, Postulates, Axioms, Common Notions, Propositions and\nDemonstrations (Dear 1995: 44\u201345). But at the end of the\nsixteenth century, Sanches would have none of it. Probably influenced\nby what he had read of\n Carneades\u2019\n sceptical-empiricist critique of mathematics\u2019 universal truths\n(cf. Cicero, Academica 2.116\u2013118; Sextus Empiricus,\nAgainst the Professors Book III: \u201cAgainst the\nGeometers\u201d), Sanches anonymously challenged the\n Platonist mathematics\n of the most renowned mathematician of the age. In the guise of a\nmodern day Carneades, Sanches wrote:\n\n\nIn my opinion\u2026 lest the senses should fail us, we should\nattempt to get whatever we can get through the eyes, with the help of\ncompass and rule, and not get into long, complicated demonstrations\nthat often make things more confusing. Far is it for me to praise an\noverabundance of complex and long demonstrations, by which we often\nmake more obscure that which in itself was clear. (LC: 300: #10, my\ntranslation)\n\n\nFor Sanches, therefore, the geometrical sign functions in the same way\nas the thing represented. In other words, geometry, for Sanches, is\nthe science of phenomenal objects of perception. Here Jean-Paul\nDumont\u2019s explanation of the way in which\n ancient scepticism\n understood phenomena may aid in contextualizing Sanches\u2019 own\nview. For the ancient sceptics, writes Dumont: \n\n\nThe phenomenon is not a subjective representation that exists only for\nthought, or for the imagination of the perceiving subject. The\nphenomenon is a material reality or, if one prefers, a body. (1972: 8)\n\n\n\nThis Protagorean scepticism\u2014and rejection of Platonism\u2014is\nexemplified in Sanches\u2019 critique of Proclus\u2019\n(412\u2013485 CE) commentary on Proposition XIV of Euclid\u2019s\nElements.\n\nSanches had addressed his critique of Proclus\u2019 commentary in an\nearlier letter he sent to Clavius. However, while this first letter\nwas lost, the extant letter, \u201cAd. C. Clavium Epistola\u201d,\ndemonstrates his dissatisfaction with Clavius\u2019 Scholastic appeal\nto consecrated authority or Proclus. In the first letter, Sanches\ncongratulates Clavius for his ability to demonstrate some of\nEuclid\u2019s propositions, with fewer words than Proclus and even\nEuclid. In keeping with common opinion, he believes it is a virtue to\nstate things as clearly as possible in order to avoid unnecessary\nconfusion \u201cespecially in mathematics, where we should understand\nas much as possible through the use of our senses\u201d (LC: 300:\n#10, my translation).\n\nWhile the first part of the paragraph above refers to the virtue of\nbrevity, the second, and more important part of it, has to do with\nSanches\u2019 empiricist notion of mathematics, for this is the basis\nof Sanches\u2019 direct critique of Proclus, and indirectly of\nClavius. Sanches writes to Clavius: \n\n\n\u2026 [Proclus] says that angles ACF and angle ACE are equal to two\nright angles, to which you respond that such angles should be added\nseparately and not in terms of one being part of the other, and that\nin this way, they are equal to two right angles. We had already come\nto that response to in previous discussion on the matter, and we agree\nthat we have refuted it [Proclus] satisfactorily. Nevertheless, we\nwill demonstrate it now with greater clarity. (LC: 301: #12)\n\n\nAnd from here, Sanches, with more than a touch irony, similar to that\nexhibited in many parts of QNS/TNK, says the following:\n\n\nSuppose I said that the eminent Clavius with his own head is a Janus\nwith two heads, would anyone believe me? Suppose that a father common\nto you and me, were to leave you in his testament two parcels of\narable lands, the ones that are two right angles, and made me the\nexecutor, would you be satisfied if I gave you the equivalent of the\nland represented by angle ACF\n [figure 1],\n which according to Proclus\u2019 demonstration equals two right\nangles? But on the other hand, we would have to consider this, for the\nquestion is one of geometry, which is to say, of measuring the\nland. (LC: 301: #12, my emphasis)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nHere we witness Sanches turning to the etymology of geometry\n(\u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03b1), meaning: the measurement\nof the land or earth (terrae mensura), followed by a second\nexample, which much like the first is based on a pragmatist view of\nmathematics\n [figure 2].\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\nIf you were to purchase a piece of cloth of the length AB, in order to\nmake a jacket, and the merchant were to give you a piece of cloth of\nsize CD alleging that that CD and CE were equivalent to AB,\ndon\u2019t you think the jacket would come out too short? (LC: 301:\n#12, my translation).\n\n\nHe summarily concludes: \n\n\nIf one were to proceed in this fashion in all mathematical matters, in\nwhich way would math be different than other deceiving disciplines?\n\n\n\nProclus was a Pythagorean and Platonic philosopher, the author of two\ncommentaries on Plato\u2019s Timaeus and the\nParmenides. For Proclus mathematical objects\u2014and that,\nof course, included the objects of geometry\u2014were not derived by\nway of abstraction from sensible particulars, but rather from ideas\nalready contained in the mind. And it was this very kind of\n\u201cdogmatic\u201d philosophy that Sanches opposed. For Sanches\nconcepts were either unprovable outside of their circular discursive\nlanguage (e.g., the syllogism), or easily dismissed through the\nsenses, as in the two cases mentioned above. It is for this reason\nthat one can justly qualify Sanches\u2019 philosophy as being\nempiricist and sceptical at once. Clavius, the addressee of the\nletter, was clearly against of the sceptics\u2019 conception of\nknowledge. Chikara Sasaki writes: \n\n\nClavius seems to have known to some extent how the skeptics attacked\nhuman knowledge. He is also reported to have reacted against a\nskeptical attitude in astronomy, which took an instrumental view\nconcerning the status of astronomical hypothesis, defending a kind of\nrealist philosophy together with Johannes Kepler. (Sasaki 2003: 58)\n\n\n\nAnd Clavius himself in opposition to Pyrrhonism wrote:\n\n\nUnless one was revived by the recognition and knowledge of arithmetic,\ngeometry and dialectic (these arts had been established by\nforefathers), he would almost arrive at the undecidedness of the\nPyrrhonists (they were philosophers who decided nothing but doubted\neverything). (Clavius quoted in Sasaki 2003: 58)\n\n\nAlmost as a challenge, then, Sanches ended his letter to Clavius, with\nthe following words: \n\n\nDo not ask who I am, for I am another Carneades [214\u2013129/8 BCE]:\nwho rather than being a friend of glory, is a friend of the truth and\nof you. Goodbye. (LC: 305 #18) \n\n\nThis, in a nutshell, describes his brand of scepticism, which rather\nthan being absolute in its denial of truth is a denial of certainty\nand perfect knowledge, and the Scholastic belief that the Aristotelian\nsyllogism guaranteed access to truth. For Sanches the truths of the\nsyllogism and dialectic were the immanent truths of (self-referential)\nlanguage, and nothing else.\n",
