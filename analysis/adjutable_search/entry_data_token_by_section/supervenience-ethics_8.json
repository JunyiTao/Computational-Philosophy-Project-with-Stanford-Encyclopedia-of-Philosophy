    "main_text": "Arguments from Ethical Supervenience || Arguments against non-reductive realism\n3.2 Arguments against non-reductive realism\n\nAs was just noted, a certain kind of reductive naturalist seems to\nhave an easy reply to Blackburn\u2019s argument. In light of this, it\nis perhaps unsurprising that several philosophers have argued that\nethical supervenience theses support reductionist forms of ethical\nrealism against non-reductive forms. Consider a few important variants\nof such arguments.\n\nThe first is a simplified version of arguments due to Frank Jackson\n(1998, Ch. 5; see also related arguments by Brown 2011 and Streumer\n2017, Ch.s 2\u20133). The argument has two steps. The first step is an\nargument that if the ethical properties strongly (or globally)\nmetaphysically supervene on the base properties, then there is no\nmetaphysically possible ethical difference between states that does\nnot have a correlated base difference between the same states. If we\nmake some liberal assumptions about property types, this entails in\nturn that there is a base property that is necessarily coextensive\nwith every ethical property.\n\nThe second step of the argument is the claim that necessarily\ncoextensive properties are identical. Brown offers a nice motivation\nfor this thesis: we should commit ourselves to the existence of a\nproperty only insofar as it can do explanatory work, and the only way\nfor a property to do explanatory work is for it to distinguish\nmetaphysical possibilities (2011, 213). If we assume that identity is\nsufficient for reduction, these two steps together entail the\nreduction of the ethical.\n\nWhile both steps of the argument are controversial, the second stage\nhas come in for especially heavy fire. (For a careful discussion of\nthe dialectic, see Suikkanen 2010; for an ingenious argument against\nJackson that identity with descriptive properties is\ncompatible with ethical non-naturalism, see Dunaway 2017). One\nimportant general basis for doubt is that many contemporary\nphilosophers question whether modality constitutes the fundamental\nexplanatory currency of metaphysics, as Jackson and Brown seem to\npresuppose (for an especially influential challenge see Fine 1994, for\nan especially radical challenge, see Sider 2011, Ch. 12).\n\nThe argument for reduction from metaphysical supervenience can,\nhowever, be prosecuted within frameworks that reject Jackson\u2019s\nand Brown\u2019s core assumptions. Consider two examples. First, one\nmight deny that necessary coextension entails identity, but\nnonetheless argue that the best explanation of ethical supervenience\nis a grounding relation that suffices to ensure that ethical\nproperties are identical to some of the base properties (Bader 2017).\nSecond, you might deny that reduction requires identity. Of course,\nidentifying non-obvious identities is a powerful model of reduction.\nFor example, a standard way of characterizing the physicalistic\nreduction of heat is that the heat in a volume of gas is\nidentical to the mean molecular kinetic energy of that volume\nof gas, which is a physical property. However, there is no consensus\nconcerning how to understand reduction as a metaphysical relation (for\na taste of the controversy, see McPherson 2015, \u00a73, and the entry\non\n scientific reduction\n and the discussion of reduction in the entry on\n David Lewis).\n\nThe core idea at stake in debates over reduction is that commitment to\nthe existence of the reduced properties should constitute no\nontological commitment \u201cover and above\u201d commitment to the\nreducing properties. Some philosophers have sought to spell out this\nidea by appealing to essence rather than to identity.\nConsider an essentialist account of reduction (cf. Rosen 2017b, 163),\non which the A properties reduce to the B-properties\njust in case:\n\n\n(i) it is necessary and sufficient for each A property to be\ninstantiated that some B property is instantiated; and\n\n(ii) these modal facts follow from the essences of the\nA-properties.\n\n\nThe idea is that if what it is to be each A property entails\nthat the A-properties are uniquely realized by the B-properties, this\namounts to a kind of reducibility of the A-properties. Consider an\nexample: one might take oneself to have offered a reduction of the\nnumber one, in claiming that: what it is to be the number one\nis just to be the successor of zero. One important contrast with the\nidentity conception is that on the essentialist conception, successful\nreductions reveal metaphysical structure. Thus, one might say in our\nexample that the number one is \u2018built out of\u2019 the number\nzero and the successor function.\n\nOn an influential essentialist account of metaphysical\nmodality, all necessities are to be explained by facts about the\nessences of things. Ralph Wedgwood (2007) and Gideon Rosen (2020)\nargue that on this sort of view, the strong metaphysical supervenience\nof the ethical would entail that the ethical possibilities are fully\nexplained by the essences of the base entities.\n\nInterestingly, both Rosen and Wedgwood reject this reductive\nconclusion. Wedgwood argues that some necessary truths (including\nethical supervenience theses) can be explained by certain contingent\ntruths, together with facts about essences, and that this sort of\nexplanation does not have reductive implications (2007, \u00a79.3; for\ncritical discussion of this response, see McPherson 2009, Sec 3, and\nespecially Schmitt and Schroeder 2011). Rosen responds by rejecting\nthe strong metaphysical supervenience of the ethical (see\n Section 5.3\n below).\n",
