    "main_text": "Varieties of Transformative Experience || Tragedy\n1.5 Tragedy\n\nUnfortunately, life also contains tragedies. The trauma of war leaves\nveterans and civilians physically and emotionally scarred in ways that\ncan change their outlook on life forever. We aren\u2019t morally\nperfect, and often fail in extremely regrettable ways. To top it all\noff, people die, sometimes after extended periods of pain and\nsuffering. Experiences of negative valence are often epistemically\nsurprising. There\u2019s no way to predict what the death of a close\nloved one will feel like, even if the death is anticipated.\nLife\u2019s tragedies also have the capacity to change who we are.\nSometimes, this change can happen for the better. Cashman and Cushman\n(2020) suggest that although we don\u2019t want to intentionally\nmorally fail, moral failure can often teach incredibly valuable\nlessons and change how we act for the better. When it comes to death,\ndying creates a chasm of understanding between those who are dying and\nthose who are not. Chung (2017\n [Other Internet Resources]),\n a philosopher who wrote about his impending death, tells of the chasm\nthat death opens up between those who are dying and those who are not.\nTruly acknowledging that one is dying changes your priorities and the\nway you experience the world in a way that can\u2019t be explained to\nsomeone who isn\u2019t dying. The same holds for someone forced to\nwitness their beloved slowly fade away. Thompson (2020) offers an\ninsightful meta-point, arguing that dying is an \u201cultimate\u201d\ntransformation because it forces us to adopt a perspective of our life\nas a whole that allows us to reconsider which of our prior experiences\ntruly were transformative.\n",
