    "main_text": "\n\nA proposition \\(A\\) is mutual knowledge among a set of agents\nif each agent knows that \\(A\\). Mutual knowledge by itself implies\nnothing about what, if any, knowledge anyone attributes to anyone\nelse. Suppose each student arrives for a class meeting knowing that\nthe instructor will be late. That the instructor will be late is\nmutual knowledge, but each student might think only she knows the\ninstructor will be late. However, if one of the students says openly\n\u201cPeter told me he will be late again,\u201d then each student\nknows that each student knows that the instructor will be late, each\nstudent knows that each student knows that each student knows that the\ninstructor will be late, and so on, ad infinitum. The\nannouncement made the mutually known fact common knowledge\namong the students.\n\nCommon knowledge is a phenomenon which underwrites much of social\nlife. In order to communicate or otherwise coordinate their behavior\nsuccessfully, individuals typically require mutual or common\nunderstandings or background knowledge. Indeed, if a particular\ninteraction results in \u201cfailure\u201d, the usual explanation\nfor this is that the agents involved did not have the common knowledge\nthat would have resulted in success. If a married couple are separated\nin a department store, they stand a good chance of finding one another\nbecause their common knowledge of each others\u2019 tastes and\nexperiences leads them each to look for the other in a part of the\nstore both know that both would tend to frequent. Since the spouses\nboth love cappuccino, each expects the other to go to the coffee bar,\nand they find one another. But in a less happy case, if a pedestrian\ncauses a minor traffic jam by crossing against a red light, she\nexplains her mistake as the result of her not noticing, and therefore\nnot knowing, the status of the traffic signal that all the motorists\nknew. The spouses coordinate successfully given their common\nknowledge, while the pedestrian and the motorists miscoordinate as the\nresult of a breakdown in common knowledge.\n\nGiven the importance of common knowledge in social interactions, it is\nremarkable that only quite recently have philosophers and social\nscientists attempted to analyze the concept. David Hume (1740) was\nperhaps the first to make explicit reference to the role of mutual\nknowledge in coordination. In his account of convention in A\nTreatise of Human Nature, Hume argued that a necessary condition\nfor coordinated activity was that agents all know what behavior to\nexpect from one another. Without the requisite mutual knowledge, Hume\nmaintained, mutually beneficial social conventions would disappear.\nMuch later, J. E. Littlewood (1953) presented some examples of\ncommon-knowledge-type reasoning, and Thomas Schelling (1960) and John\nHarsanyi (1967\u20131968) argued that something like common knowledge\nis needed to explain certain inferences people make about each other.\nThe philosopher Robert Nozick describes, but does not develop, the\nnotion in his doctoral dissertation (Nozick 1963), while the first\nmathematical analysis and application of the notion of common\nknowledge is found in the technical report by Friedell (1967), then\npublished as (Friedell\n 1969).[1]\n The first full-fledged philosophical analysis of common knowledge was\noffered by David Lewis (1969) in the monograph Convention.\nStephen Schiffer (1972), Robert Aumann (1976), and Gilbert Harman\n(1977) independently gave alternate definitions of common knowledge.\nJon Barwise (1988, 1989) gave a precise formulation of Harman\u2019s\nintuitive account. Throughout the 1980s a number of epistemic\nlogicians, both from philosophy and from computer science, studied the\nlogical structure of common knowledge, and the interested reader\nshould consult the relevant portions of the two important monographs\n(Fagin et al. 1995) and (Meyer and Van der Hoek 1995). Margaret\nGilbert (1989) proposed a somewhat different account of common\nknowledge which she argues is preferable to the standard account.\nOthers have developed accounts of mutual knowledge, approximate\ncommon knowledge, and common belief which require less\nstringent assumptions than the standard account, and which serve as\nmore plausible models of what agents know in cases where strict common\nknowledge seems impossible (Brandenburger and Dekel 1987,\n\u00a0Monderer and Samet 1989, Rubinstein 1992). The analysis and\napplications of common knowledge and related multi-agent knowledge\nconcepts has become a lively field of research.\n\nThe purpose of this essay is to overview of some of the most important\nresults stemming from this contemporary research. The topics reviewed\nin each section of this essay are as follows: Section 1 gives\nmotivating examples which illustrate a variety of ways in which the\nactions of agents depend crucially upon their having, or lacking,\ncertain common knowledge. Section 2 discusses alternative analyses of\ncommon knowledge. Section 3 reviews applications of multi-agent\nknowledge concepts, particularly to game theory (von Neumann\nand Morgenstern 1944), in which common knowledge assumptions have been\nfound to have great importance in justifying solution\nconcepts for mathematical games. Section 4 discusses skeptical\ndoubts about the attainability of common knowledge. Finally, Section 5\ndiscusses the common belief concept which result from\nweakening the assumptions of Lewis\u2019 account of common\nknowledge.\n",
