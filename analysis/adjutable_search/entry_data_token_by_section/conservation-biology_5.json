    "main_text": "What is Conservation Biology? || Northern Spotted Owls\n2.1 Northern Spotted Owls\n\nMetapopulation models are extremely important and have been used in\none of the most difficult of environmental debates, that surrounding\nthe northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) and its\nhabitat (Durbin 1996; Norse 1990; Yaffee 1994). The northern spotted\nowl is a subspecies that lives exclusively in old-growth coniferous\nforests in northern California, western Washington and Oregon.\nNorthern spotted owls are monogamous and each breeding pair uses one\nto three square miles of forest that is at least two-hundred and fifty\nyears old. Farms, logging and other forms of development reduced\nnorthern spotted owl habitat. So, scientists and policymakers began to\nask what must we do if we are to prevent them from going extinct? One\nway of answering that question is to use metapopulation models.\n\nIn 1985, environmental lawyer Andrew Stahl presented mathematical\nbiologist Russell Lande just this question Yaffee (1994: 98). He\nshowed Lande the US Forest Service\u2019s \u201cregional\nguide\u201d which was their plan to protect the northern spotted owl\nand asked Lande to determine if it would be sufficient. Using a\nvariety of data, he devised the following metapopulation model to try\nto answer this question (Lande 1988a but see Lande 1988b as well). Let\n\\(\\epsilon\\) be the probability that a juvenile female inherits her\nmother\u2019s territory, \\(m\\) be the number of territories a\njuvenile can disperse through before dying, \\(h\\) be the proportion of\nhabitable territory, and \\(p\\) be the proportion of occupied habitable\nsites. Therefore, the probability of a female not finding habitable\nterritory in \\(m\\) trials is, \n\n\\[\n(1-\\epsilon)(ph+1-h)^m\n\\]\n\n\nThis just is the probability of not inheriting the territory of\none\u2019s mother and not successfully dispersing to an unoccupied\nterritory before death. Female northern spotted owls reproduce only\nwhen they are three years old and we can represent their growth rate\nby \\(\\lambda = N_{t+1}/N_t\\). When \\(\\lambda = 1\\), the species is in\na demographic equilibrium. Assuming they are in such an equilibrium,\nthen, \n\n\\[\n[1-(1-\\epsilon)(ph + 1 - h)^m] R'_{0} =1\n\\]\n\n\n\\(R_{0}' = \\sum_{x=0}^{\\infty}l_{x}'f_x\\) where \\(l_{x}'\\) is the\nprobability of surviving to age \\(x\\) assuming she has found habitable\nterritory and \\(f_x\\) is the mean lifetime offspring production per\nfemale assuming she finds habitable territory. Finally, we can solve\nthe following, \n\n\\[\n\\hat{p} = \\left\\{\n     \\begin{array}{lr}\n       1 - \\frac{1-k}{h} & \\text{for}  \\ h > 1 - k\\\\\n       0 & \\text{for} \\ h \\leq 1 - k\n     \\end{array}\n   \\right.\n\\]\n\n\nIn the above, \\(k\\) is the equilibrium occupancy of the territory.\nGiven this model, the northern spotted owl can persist if, and only\nif, \\(h > 1- k\\). Lande determined that in 1987, 38% of forest in\nwestern Washington and Oregon was older than two hundred years. So,\n\\(h = 0.38\\). Fieldwork suggests that 44% of sites were occupied.\nThus, \\(p = 0.44\\). We can determine \\(k\\) from this equation,\n\\(k=1-h(1-p)\\). Hence, \\(k = 0.79\\). The forest plans suggested\nleaving between \\(7 - 16\\%\\) of 200 or more year old forest. But given\nthat \\(1 - k = 0.21\\), Lande argued \\(7 - 16\\%\\) was insufficient and\nthe forest plans should be revised. Lande and others\u2019 work led\nto the US Forest Service withdrawing six old growth forest timber\nsales in Oregon and Washington and became a component of the 1994\nadoption of the Northwest Forest Plan that protected 8 million acres\nof old-growth forests. This was an increase to protecting 80% of the\nowl\u2019s remaining habitat in comparison to 5% protected by the\nForest Service\u2019s original owl plan.\n\nModels like Lande\u2019s, and population viability analysis (PVA)\nmore generally, often are susceptible to several criticisms (see\nBeissinger & McCullough (2002) for a discussion of PVA, and\nWimsatt (1981) for a discussion of the robustness and fragility of\nmodels). They exhibit parameter and structural sensitivity; if we\nchange the parameter values or change the assumptions of the models,\nwe often find very different results. For example, Patrick Foley\nexamined a model of grizzly bears Ursus arctic in Yellowstone\nNational Park that incorporated environmental stochasticity along with\nintrinsic growth rates and carrying capacity (Foley 1994). The model\nfor estimated values of the above predicted the expected time to\nextinction was 12, 000 years. However, he later examined a model which\nincluded demographic and environmental stochasticity but set\ndemographic stochasticity to zero (Foley 1997). The expected time to\nextinction was approximately 50 years. Thus, PVA models can be very\nfragile with respect to their parameter values and functional\nforms.\n\nOf course, Lande\u2019s metapopulation model is clearly abstracted\nand idealized. However, he argued that his model was consistent with\nthe data and that his predictions were more conservative than that of\na more realistic model. First, he argued that the data showed that the\nannual geometric growth rate of the northern spotted was not\nsignificantly different from equilibrium (e.g., \\(0.96 \\pm0.03\\), see\nLande 1988a: 605). Second, if we assume that owls have difficulty\nfinding mates, or dispersal is more limited, or there is demographic\nor environmental stochasticity, this would reduce \\(k\\) even\nfurther.\n",
