    "main_text": "Content, Force, and How Saying Can Make It So || Theories of Performativity\n2.3 Theories of Performativity\n\n\nAustin famously denied that performatives are statements (1962,\np. 6). This may be taken either as the denial that performative\nsentences, even those in the indicative grammatical mood, have truth\nvalue; or instead as the denial that utterances of performative\nsentences, even when such sentences have truth value, are\nassertions. One can consistently hold that an indicative sentence has\ntruth value, and even that it may be uttered in such a way as to say\nsomething true, while denying that its utterance is an\nassertion. (Testing a microphone in a windowless room, I utter,\n\u201cIt\u2019s raining,\u201d and it happens to be raining outside. Here\nI have said something true but have made no assertion.)\n\nLemmon 1962 argues that performative utterances are true on the ground\nthat they are instances of a wider class of sentences whose utterance\nguarantees their truth. If sound, this argument would show that\nperformatives have truth value, but not that they are assertions. It\nalso leaves unanswered the question why some verb phrases such as\n\u2018I promise\u2019 may be used performatively while others cannot\nbe so used. Sinnott-Armstrong 1994 also argues that performatives can\nhave truth value without addressing the question whether they are also\nused to make assertions. Reimer 1995 argues that while performatives\nhave truth values, they are not also assertions. Adopting a similar\nstrategy, Jary 2007 aims to explain how utterances of such sentences\nas \u201cI order you to clean the kitchen,\u201d can succeed in\nbeing orders. In so doing he draws on Green\u2019s 2007 analysis of\nshowing to argue that such utterances show (rather than merely\ndescribe) the force of the speaker\u2019s utterance. Because\n\u2018show\u2019 is factive, if such an utterance shows its force,\nthen it must have that force.\n\nMost challenges to Austin, however, construe performatives as\nassertions and attempt to explain their properties in that\nlight. Ginet 1979 argues that performative verbs\n(\u2018promise,\u2019 \u2018appoint\u2019, etc.) name the kinds of\nacts that one can perform by asserting that one is doing so, and\nelaborates on why this is so. In this way he offers an account of how\nperformatives work that depends on the assumption that performative\nutterances are assertions. Starting from that same assumption, Bach\n1975 contends that \u2018I order you to clean the kitchen\u2019 is\nan assertion, and proceeds to explain on this basis how the speaker is\nindirectly also issuing an order. This explanation depends on the\nspeaker\u2019s being able to count on the addressee\u2019s ability\nto discern the speaker\u2019s communicative intention. In later work,\nsuch as Bach and Harnish 1978, and 1992, this view is refined with a\nnotion of standardization, so that a sufficiently common practice of\nissuing assertions with performative effect enables speakers and\nhearers to bypass complex inferential reasoning and jump by default to\na conclusion about the illocution being performed. Reimer 1995\nchallenges Bach and Harnish on the ground that hearers do not seem to\nimpute assertoric force to the indicative sentences speakers utter\nwith performative effect; her criticism would evidently carry over to\nGinet\u2019s proposal. Instead Reimer contends that\nperformative utterances rest on systems of what she terms\nillocutionary conventions to achieve their performative effects.\n\n\nSearle 1969, p. 62\u20134, had argued that a performative formula such as\n\u201cI promise to\u2026\u201d is an \u201cillocutionary force\nindicator\u201d in the sense that it is a device whose role is to\nmake explicit the force of the speaker\u2019s utterance. Making something\nexplicit, however, would seem to involve characterizing an independent\nevent or state of affairs, and as a result Searle\u2019s account\npresupposes that speakers can imbue their utterances with the force of\ndemotions and excommunications; yet this is what was to be\nexplained. Realizing this, Searle and Vanderveken (1985) characterize\nperformatives as speech acts having the force of\ndeclarations. Uncontroversial examples of this speech act are\ndeclaring war or adjourning a meeting. Searle 1989 then acknowledges\nthat this account pushes us back to the question how certain\nexpressions come to have the power to make declarations. In that same\nwork he offers an answer that depends on the view that in uttering a\nsentence with a performative prefix, a speaker manifests an intention\nto perform an act of a certain kind: in uttering the words, \u2018I\norder you to close the door\u2019, I manifest an intention to order\nyou to close the door, etc. Searle also takes it that manifesting an\nintention to perform a speech act is sufficient for the performance of\nthat act. On this basis, Searle goes on to attempt to derive the\nassertoric nature of performatives, holding that when uttered in such\na way as to say something true, they are also assertions.\n",
