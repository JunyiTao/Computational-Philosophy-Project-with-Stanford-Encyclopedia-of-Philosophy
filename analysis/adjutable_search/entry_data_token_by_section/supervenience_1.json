    "main_text": "History || \u2018Supervenience\u2019 as a Philosophical Term of Art\n2.1 \u2018Supervenience\u2019 as a Philosophical Term of Art\n\n\u2018Supervenience\u2019 and its cognates are technical terms. This\nis not news; \u2018supervene\u2019 is rarely used outside the\nphilosophy room these days. But it occasionally is, and when it is, it\ntypically has a different meaning. It is typically used to mean\n\u201ccoming or occurring as something additional, extraneous, or\nunexpected\u201d (Webster\u2019s New International\nDictionary, 3rd edition). This is the sense at issue\nin the following passages from the Oxford English Dictionary:\n\u201cupon a sudden supervened the death of the king\n(1674\u201348)\u201d and \u201cThe king was bruised by the pommel\nof his saddle; fever supervened, and the injury proved fatal\n(1867)\u201d (cited in Kim 1990, 2\u20133). It is also the sense at\nissue in W.V.O. Quine\u2019s autobiographical remark about his\nadolescence: \u201cnecking, as it was called, supervened in the\nfullness of time as necking will\u201d (1985, 43). However, this use\nof \u2018supervenience\u2019 is irrelevant to the philosophical use\nof the term. The philosophical use of \u2018supervenience\u2019 is\nstrictly proprietary, and so in no way beholden to its vernacular\nuse(s). In this way, \u2018supervene\u2019 is different from terms\nlike \u2018cause,\u2019 \u2018freedom,\u2019 or\n\u2018justice\u2019. \u2018Supervene\u2019 receives its sense by\nstipulation, and the notion so defined is to be judged by its\nphilosophical fruits (McLaughlin 1995).\n",
