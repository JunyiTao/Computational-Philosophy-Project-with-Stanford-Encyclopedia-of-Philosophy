    "main_text": "Objections to Pascal\u2019s Wager || Premise 1: The Decision Table\n5.1 Premise 1: The Decision Table\n\nHere the objections are manifold. Most of them can be stated quickly,\nbut we will give special attention to what has generally been regarded\nas the most important of them, \u2018the many Gods objection\u2019\n(see also the link to footnote 7).\n\n1. Different decision tables for different people. The argument\nassumes that the same decision table\u00a0applies to everybody.\nHowever, perhaps the relevant rewards are different for different\npeople. Perhaps, for example, there is a predestined infinite reward\nfor the Chosen, whatever they do, and finite utility for the rest, as\nMackie 1982 suggests. Or maybe the prospect of salvation appeals more\nto some people than to others, as Swinburne 1969 has noted.\n\nEven granting that a single \\(2 \\times 2\\)\u00a0table\u00a0applies to\neverybody, one might dispute the values that enter into it. This\nbrings us to the next two objections.\n\n2. The utility of salvation could not be infinite. One might\nargue that the very notion of infinite utility is suspect\u2014see\nfor example Jeffrey 1983 and McClennen\n 1994.[7]\n Hence, the objection continues, whatever the utility of salvation\nmight be, it must be finite. Strict finitists, who are suspicious of\nthe notion of infinity in general, will agree\u2014see Dummett 1978\nand Wright 1987. Or perhaps the notion of infinite utility makes\nsense, but an infinite reward could only be finitely appreciated by a\nhuman being.\n\n3. There should be more than one infinity in the table. There\nare also critics of the Wager who, far from objecting to infinite\nutilities, want to see more of them in the table. For\nexample, it might be thought that a forgiving God would bestow\ninfinite utility upon wagerers-for and wagerers-against\nalike\u2014Rescher 1985 is one author who entertains this\npossibility. Or it might be thought that, on the contrary, wagering\nagainst an existent God results in negative infinite utility.\n(As we have noted, some authors read Pascal himself as saying as\nmuch.) Either way, \\(f_2\\) is not really finite at all, but \\(\\infty\\)\nor \\(-\\infty\\) as the case may be. And perhaps \\(f_1\\) and \\(f_3\\)\ncould be \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\). Suppose, for instance, that God\ndoes not exist, but that we are reincarnated ad infinitum,\nand that the total utility we receive is an infinite sum that diverges\nto infinity or to negative infinity.\n\n4. The table\u00a0should have more rows. Perhaps there is more\nthan one way to wager for God, and the rewards that God bestows vary\naccordingly. For instance, God might not reward infinitely those who\nstrive to believe in Him only for the very mercenary reasons that\nPascal gives, as James 1956 has observed. One could also imagine\ndistinguishing belief based on faith from belief based on evidential\nreasons, and posit different rewards in each case.\n\n5. The table\u00a0should have more columns: the many Gods\nobjection. If Pascal is really right that reason can decide\nnothing here, then it would seem that various other theistic\nhypotheses are also live options. Pascal presumably had in mind the\nCatholic conception of God\u2014let us suppose that this is the God\nwho either \u2018exists\u2019 or \u2018does not exist\u2019. By\nexcluded middle, this is a partition. The objection, then, is that the\npartition is not sufficiently fine-grained, and the \u2018(Catholic)\nGod does not exist\u2019 column really subdivides into various\nother theistic hypotheses. The objection could equally run\nthat Pascal\u2019s argument \u2018proves too much\u2019: by\nparallel reasoning we can \u2018show\u2019 that rationality requires\nbelieving in various incompatible theistic hypotheses. As Diderot\n(1746) puts the point: \u201cAn Imam could reason just as well this\n way\u201d.[8]\n\nSince then, the point has been presented again and refined in various\nways. Mackie 1982 writes, \u201cthe church within which alone\nsalvation is to be found is not necessarily the Church of Rome, but\nperhaps that of the Anabaptists or the Mormons or the Muslim Sunnis or\nthe worshippers of Kali or of Odin\u201d (203). Cargile 1966 shows\njust how easy it is to multiply theistic hypotheses: for each real\nnumber \\(x\\), consider the God who prefers contemplating \\(x\\) more\nthan any other activity. It seems, then, that such \u2018alternative\ngods\u2019 are a dime a dozen\u2014or \\(\\aleph_1\\), for that\nmatter.\n\nIn response, some authors argue that in such a competition among\nvarious possible deities for one\u2019s belief, some are more\nprobable than others. Although there may be ties among the expected\nutilities\u2014all infinite\u2014for believing in various ones among\nthem, their respective probabilities can be used as tie-breakers.\nSchlesinger (1994, 90) offers this principle: \u201cIn cases where\nthe mathematical expectations are infinite, the criterion for choosing\nthe outcome to bet on is its probability\u201d. (Note that this\nprinciple is not found in the Wager itself, although it might be\nregarded as a friendly addition. Askell 2018 proposes a similar\nprinciple.) Are there reasons, then, for assigning higher probability\nto some Gods than others? Jordan (1994a, 107) suggests that some\noutlandish theistic hypotheses may be dismissed for having \u201cno\nbacking of tradition\u201d. Similarly, Schlesinger maintains that\nPascal is addressing readers who \u201chave a notion of what genuine\nreligion is about\u201d (88), and we might take that to suggest that\nCargile\u2019s imagined Gods, for example, may be correspondingly\nassigned lower probability than Pascal\u2019s God. Franklin (2018,\n41) writes that \u201c[Pascal's] rhetoric is addressed to real\nagents, namely \u201dmen of the world\u201c in the Paris of 1660\u201d\u00a0for\nwhom \u201cthe spectrum of religious theories to which they attached\ngrounded subjective non-zero probability consisted of just Catholicism\nand atheism\u201d. Saka (2018, 190\u2013191) replies to various authors\nwho relativise the Wager to Pascal's intended audience that\n\u201cPascal's peers knew of Greco-Roman paganism, Judaism, Islam,\nnew-world paganism, and multiple brands of Protestantism; they knew of\nalleged Satanism \u2026 and they knew, from their acquaintance with the\nforegoing, that still other religions could readily be\nhypothesized.\u201d\u00a0But still there is the issue of what\nprobabilities should be assigned to alternative deities.\u00a0Lycan\nand Schlesinger 1989 give more theoretical reasons for favoring\nPascal\u2019s God over others in one\u2019s probability assignments.\nThey begin by noting the familiar problem in science of\nunderdetermination of theory by evidence. Faced with a multiplicity of\ntheories that all fit the observed data equally well, we favor the\nsimplest such theory. They go on to argue that simplicity\nconsiderations similarly favor a conception of God as\n\u201cabsolutely perfect\u201d, \u201cwhich is theologically unique\nin that it implies all the other predicates traditionally ascribed to\nGod\u201d (104), and we may add that this conception is\nPascal\u2019s. Conceptions of rival Gods, by contrast, leave open\nvarious questions about their nature, the answering of which would\ndetract from their simplicity, and thus their probability.\n\nFinally, Bartha 2012 models one\u2019s probability assignments to\nvarious theistic hypotheses as evolving over time according to a\n\u2018deliberational dynamics\u2019 somewhat analogous to the\ndynamics of evolution by natural selection. So understood,\nPascal\u2019s Wager is not a single decision, but rather a sequence\nof decisions in which one\u2019s probabilities update sequentially in\nproportion to how choiceworthy each God appeared to be in the previous\nround. (This relies on a sophisticated handling of infinite utilities\nin terms of utility ratios given in his 2007; see below.) He argues\nthat a given probability assignment is choiceworthy only if it is an\nequilibrium of this deliberational dynamics. He shows that certain\nassignments are choiceworthy by this criterion, thus providing a kind\nof vindication of Pascal against the many Gods objection.\n",
