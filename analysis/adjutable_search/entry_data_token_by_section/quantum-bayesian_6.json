He takes the present\nmoment as something that is immediately experienced by each of us, and\nso (from a CBist perspective) just the sort of thing that physics is\nultimately about. By contrast, he says\n\n\nspace-time is an abstraction that I construct to organize such\nexperiences. (Mermin 2014: 422\u20133)\n\n\nAccording to Mermin, a common Now is an inference for each person from\nhis or her immediate experience: But that it is as fundamental a\nfeature of two perceiving subjects that when two people are together\nat an event, if the event is Now for one of them, then it is Now for\nboth.\n\nUnlike QBism, CBism is not a subjective or personalist view of states\nand probabilities in physics. But both QBism and CBism depend on a\ngeneral view of science as an individual quest to organize one\u2019s\npast experiences and to anticipate one\u2019s future experiences.\nThis is a view that has antecedents even in views expressed by\nphysicists generally thought of as realists, such as Einstein (1949:\n673\u20134) and Bell, whom Mermin (2019: 8) quotes as follows:\n\n\nI think we invent concepts, like \u201cparticle\u201d or\n\u201cProfessor Peierls\u201d, to make the immediate sense of data\nmore intelligible. (J.S. Bell, letter to R.E. Peierls,\n24-February-1983)\n\n",
