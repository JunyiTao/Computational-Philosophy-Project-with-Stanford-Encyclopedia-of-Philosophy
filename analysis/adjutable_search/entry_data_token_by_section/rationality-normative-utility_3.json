One possible\nanswer is that expected utility theory is rational bedrock\u2014that\nmeans-end rationality essentially involves maximizing expected\nutility. For those who find this answer unsatisfying, however,\nthere are two further sources of justification. First, there are\nlong-run arguments, which rely on evidence that expected-utility\nmaximization is a profitable policy in the long term. \nSecond, there are arguments based on representation theorems, which\nsuggest that certain rational constraints on preference entail that all\nrational agents maximize expected utility.\n",
