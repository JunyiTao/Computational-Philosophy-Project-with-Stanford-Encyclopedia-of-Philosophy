    "main_text": "Critique, Reflexivity, Subjectivity\n4. Critique, Reflexivity, Subjectivity\n\nNovalis\u2019s philosophical readership, his critics and supporters\nalike, have paid a great deal of attention to his interpretation of\nFichte. For Novalis\u2019s generation, Fichte was seen as the true\nheir of Kant\u2019s critical thinking. In the Athenaeum\nFragments, Schlegel applauds Fichte\u2019s move beyond the\nKantian architecture of reason, and in his Lectures on the History\nof Philosophy Hegel, likewise, suggests that it was Fichte who\nprovided the speculative unity that Kant\u2019s system was lacking.\nBy emphasizing the I\u2019s absolute and immediate positing of\nitself, Fichte, it was claimed, suspended the self-imposed limitations\nof Kantian idealism. He thus succeeded in overcoming the dichotomies\nthat had plagued Kant\u2019s contemporary readers, including the\ndichotomies of reason and sensibility, spontaneity and receptivity,\nfreedom and necessity. With Fichte, philosophy was grounded in one\nultimate and unifying principle: that of the I\u2019s positing of\nitself as absolute and free (that is, in the jargon of the period, of\nthe I positing itself as absolutely self-positing).\n\nAs Friedrich Schlegel lays out his philosophical-poetic principles in\nthe famous Athenaeum Fragment 216, Fichte\u2019s theory of\nthe I\u2019s absolute self-positing established a sine qua\nnon of the romantic program. If the French Revolution, in its\nearlier phases, had opened up a new space of political action,\nrealizing, in concreto, the principle of the rational\nself-determination of a people, and if Goethe\u2019s Wilhelm\nMeister, crossing genre boundaries by drawing on philosophy,\npoetry, and drama alike, had set a new standard for the modern novel\nas a complete and all-encompassing work of art\u2014a literary\nGesamtkunstwerk\u2014it was Fichte who had led philosophy\nback to the unbound spontaneity of subjectivity, thus realizing the\nimplicit promise of Kant\u2019s transcendental turn.\n\nIn his aesthetics, Kant had discussed how natural beauty, in\ntriggering a free play between imagination and understanding, gives\nthe disinterested spectator a hint that nature might be designed so as\nto facilitate the work of our cognitive faculties, hence also allowing\nfor the possibility of a system of inductive knowledge and the idea of\na will behind what, from the perspective of the understanding, appears\nas the realm of blind causality. In the aesthetic experience,\ntranscendental imagination is furnished with the regulative function\nof providing human beings with a sense of orientation in the\nworld\u2014a sense of belonging or purpose. Kant also had proposed\nthat man-made beauty, i.e., art, puts forth a sensuous presentation of\nthe ideas of reason. And, finally, he had established a close\nconnection between the work of art and the spontaneous production of\ncreative genius.\n\nIn Kant\u2019s system, however, the bridge between freedom and\nnecessity is restricted to the realm of the aesthetic judgment. The\npure aesthetic judgment can be ascribed a merely subjective\nuniversality. Fichte, however, brought out the full philosophical\npotential of the Kantian idea of freedom. In Fichte\u2019s theory,\nthe creative spontaneity of imagination is so to speak\nuniversalized\u2014it is turned into the distinctive feature of the\nabsolute, positing I, which is free even to posit its ontological\ncounterpart in the limiting non-I. Hence the cautious \u201cas\nif\u201d-status of the purposiveness of nature in the aesthetic\nexperience is sublated. At a transcendental level, even causally\ndetermined nature is explained in light of the self-positing ego. The\ngap between subjectivity and nature, freedom and necessity,\nspontaneity and receptivity is ultimately bridged. This, thought\nNovalis and many with him, was the achievement of Fichte\u2019s\nphilosophy.\n\nYet, for all his progress beyond the Kantian framework, Fichte had\nfailed to address the more deep-seated problem of meaning that was\npart of the Kantian agenda: the possibility of there being a will or\nrationality behind the universe as such, a will or rationality that is\nprior to and constitutive of subjectivity, hence granting it a sense\nof meaning and purpose. Whereas Kant had framed this as a question of\nteleology and natural beauty, Novalis and his fellow romantics linked\nit to the experience of art and poetry in particular. I return to\nNovalis\u2019s philosophy of art in the next section. What is\nimportant at this point, however, is to realize how Novalis develops\nhis standpoint in critical response to the philosophical challenges\nposed by Kant and Fichte.\n\nAllegedly, H\u00f6lderlin and Novalis met with Fichte in the home of\nFriedrich Immanuel Niethammer in Jena in 1795. The meeting with\nFichte, it is said (though the historical documentation is scant),\nstrengthened Novalis\u2019s interest in his philosophy and led to the\nwork that would culminate in the Fichte Studies. Nonetheless,\nthe collection was not given its title by Novalis himself but added by\nthe editor, Hans-Joachim M\u00e4hl. The Fichte Studies does not\ndeal exclusively with Fichte\u2019s philosophy, but addresses a broad\nrange of philosophical problems, one of which is Novalis\u2019s\nworries with regard to subjective idealism. Other topics include the\nhistory of philosophy, the relationship between art and philosophy,\nand the relationship between art and science. Nonetheless, this\ncollection of notes and observations shelters the most coherent\naccount of Novalis\u2019s interpretation of Fichte.\n\nAlthough Novalis admires Fichte, he is more cautious in his attitude\nthan many of his contemporaries. In the Fichte Studies he\npolemically asks whether Fichte has not \u201ctoo arbitrarily packed\neverything into the I\u201d (FS #5). And in Notes for a Romantic\nEncyclopaedia (Das Allgemeine Brouillon), written a few\nyears later, his critique is poignantly articulated in the analogy\nbetween the Fichtean ego and the desolate main character of Daniel\nDefoe\u2019s famous novel: \u201cFichte\u2019s ego\u2014is a\nRobinson Crusoe\u2014a scientific fiction\u201d (AB\n#717).\n\nAccording to Novalis\u2014whose thinking at this point converges with\nH\u00f6lderlin\u2019s response to subjective\nidealism\u2014Fichte\u2019s theory is ultimately rooted in the\nimmediacy of the I\u2019s self-positing, and it presupposes that the\ncapacity for self-reflection can be traced back to a\nnon-representational self-relation or intellectual intuition that\nevades the very structure of reflectivity and hence also the\nsubject-object relationship between the reflecting and the reflected\nego. Novalis maintains that in order to take a reflective stance\ntowards itself, the self needs to represent itself in some form or\nanother. The I\u2019s most original self-relation cannot simply take\nthe form of an original Tathandlung in which the reflecting\nself (the subject pole of the self-reflection) claims immediate\nidentity with itself as reflected (i.e., as the object pole of the\nself-reflection). In Novalis\u2019s view, self-reflection requires\nsome kind of external representation. Such a representation cannot,\nhowever, be deduced from the immediate identity (FS #11). The identity\nof the reflecting and the reflected I is grounded in a feeling (FS\n#11). Thought, however, fails to grasp this feeling.\n\nNovalis follows Kant in claiming that thought and feeling make up two\nirreducible sources of experience. Given this dual source of\nexperience, philosophy cannot, as Fichte would have it, be rooted in\none single principle. To be sure, the idea of such a principle is\nattractive to the extent that it would aid in undermining the Kantian\ndualism of concept and intuition, and ultimately also guarantee the\nself-determination of rational subjectivity. Yet such a principle\ncannot be given. Instead of adhering to the completely autonomous\nsubjectivity of Fichtean philosophy, Novalis argues that the subject\nis inwardly split, not just between thought and feeling, but\nultimately also between the hubris of believing that thought can in\nfact grasp the basic self-feeling, and the realization that this\nfeeling cannot be conceptually processed as such. The latter point not\nonly involves a modification of the scope of reflexive subjectivity,\nbut also of philosophy itself. As Novalis emphatically puts it,\n\u201c[t]he borders of feeling are the borders of\nphilosophy\u201d (FS #15, emphasis added).\n\nIf Novalis develops his own philosophical voice through the encounter\nwith Fichte, he also takes a significant step beyond the\nepistemological framework of The Science of Knowledge. Some\nscholars, such as Manfred Frank and Jane Kneller, see the Fichte\nStudies, with its insistence on the two sources of experience, as\ngesturing back to a more Kantian position\u2014a Kantian moderation\nof Fichte\u2019s idealism. Such an interpretation is not only\njustified by reference to Novalis\u2019s critique of Fichte, but also\ngiven historical support in light of Novalis\u2019s relatively close\ncontact with Kantian philosophers such as Karl Leonhard Reinhold and\nCarl Christian Erhard Schmid. Furthermore, on having completed his\nstudies of Fichte, Novalis quickly returns to Kant. In the so-called\nKant Studies, whose scope spans Kant\u2019s practical as\nwell as theoretical philosophy, he speaks of Kant\u2019s\nphilosophizing as scholastic, yet celebrates it as \u201cone of the\nmost remarkable phenomena of the human spirit\u201d (KS, 337). In\ncritically endorsing Kant\u2019s idea of transcendental idealism as\nthe science of philosophy, Novalis, too, wishes to see philosophy as a\nmeta-discipline, a rational account of the boundaries of\nrationality.\n\nNovalis\u2019s work is neither strictly speaking Kantian nor strictly\nspeaking Fichtean in spirit. On assessing Novalis\u2019s reflections\non transcendental idealism, it is important to keep in mind that when\nhe, in 1797, returns to Kant\u2019s thinking, he views it through the\nlens of Fichte\u2019s philosophy. Furthermore, Fichte\u2019s\nthinking, for Novalis, did not just consist in the various theses of\nThe Science of Knowledge (Wissenschaftslehre), but\nalso in a certain way of doing philosophy. \u201cFichtean philosophy\nis a call to self-activity,\u201d insists Novalis (FS #567). That is,\nit is a mode of philosophizing rather than a given claim about the\nabsolute freedom of the transcendental ego. In this respect,\nFichte\u2019s most important work is not the\nWissenschaftslehre, but his lecture on the scholar\u2019s\nvocation, \u00dcber die Bestimmung des Gelehrten, which he\nsupposedly read in Jena in 1794 and which would then be eagerly\nstudied in Jena and Weimar. Even though Novalis had good family\nconnections to Fichte, we do not know for sure whether he had access\nto the unpublished version of this text. However, Novalis\u2019s\nemphasis on intellectual responsibility, self-thinking, and autonomy\nspeaks clearly of a responsiveness to this dimension of Fichte\u2019s\nwork. Novalis\u2019s reflections on these issues culminate in his\nnotion of Bildung. This is also the point at which Novalis\nceases to present himself as a critical commentator of subjective\nidealism and produces an independent philosophical contribution of\nlasting force and value.\n",
