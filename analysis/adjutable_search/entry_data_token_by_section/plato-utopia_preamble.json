    "main_text": "\n\nThe Laws is one of Plato\u2019s last dialogues. In it, he\nsketches the basic political structure and laws of an ideal city named\nMagnesia. Despite the fact that the Laws treats a number of\nbasic issues in political and ethical philosophy as well as theology,\nit has suffered neglect compared with the Republic. In recent\nyears, however, more scholarly attention has been paid to the\nLaws. This entry discusses some of the most important issues\narising in recent scholarship and suggests avenues for future\nresearch.\n",
