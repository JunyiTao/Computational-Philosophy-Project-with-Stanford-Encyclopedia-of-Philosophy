    "main_text": "Perfectionism in Politics\n3. Perfectionism in Politics\n\n\nThe transition from perfectionist ethics to perfectionist politics\nis a natural one to make. Political institutions can be arranged,\nand state policies can be adopted, that promote or impede perfectionist\nvalues in various ways and to varying degrees. If one is\ncommitted to perfectionist ethics, then this commitment establishes a\npresumption in favor of perfectionism in politics. Other things\nbeing equal, one should favor political institutions and state policies\nthat do the best job of promoting the good in the context in which they\napply. Importantly, this natural presumption can be\ndefeated. For one thing, the political pursuit of perfectionist\nends might be self-defeating. This possibility is considered\nbelow. But it will be useful to begin by assuming that\nperfectionist state policies can be effective in achieving their\naims.\n\n\nCritics of perfectionist politics often reject the idea that there\nare objectively better and worse ways of living. Subjectivism or\nnihilism about the good often stands behind anti-perfectionist\ncommitments. But the most influential recent philosophical\ncriticisms of perfectionist politics do not stem from this\nquarter. Sophisticated critics of perfectionism grant, if only\nfor the sake of argument, the claims of perfectionist value\ntheory. They then seek to show that perfectionist state policies,\neven if informed by a sound understanding of the good, nonetheless\nwould be illegitimate. The character of perfectionist politics is\nbest appreciated by considering these arguments and their\nlimitations.\n",
