    "main_text": "Conclusion\n7. Conclusion\n\nDespite the initial appearance of simplicity in its assumptions,\nstructure and argumentation, we have turned up several important\nproblems and lacunae that stand in the way of any overall final\nassessment of the plausibility of Anomalous Monism. While the central\nobjections it has faced have derived from epiphenomenalist concerns,\nthe force of these objections is not clear. Arguably, the most serious\ndifficulties for Anomalous Monism are not with its adequacy but with\nits justification. We still stand in need of a clear argument for how\nrationality leads to the anomalism principle; there are the\nsubstantial problems surrounding the status of the causal closure of\nthe physical and its bearing on monism; and the cause-law\nprinciple\u2019s strictness requirement is still in need of a\ncompelling rationale. Even with these problems, Anomalous Monism\ncontinues to provide an extremely useful framework for exploring\nfundamental issues and problems in the philosophy of mind, and has\nearned a central place on the rather short list of important positions\non the relation between mental and physical events and properties.",
