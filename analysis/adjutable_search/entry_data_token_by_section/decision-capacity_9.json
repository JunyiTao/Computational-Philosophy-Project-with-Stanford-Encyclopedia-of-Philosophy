Five Widely Accepted Assumptions (And a Sixth, More Controversial One)\n\nThere are five important assumptions that underlie virtually all\ncontemporary work on decisional capacity and with which anyone\ninterested in the topic must be familiar. For ease of reference we\nhave named them: (1) inclusivity, (2) decision-relativity, (3)\nall-or-nothing assessment, (4) value neutrality, and (5) independence\nfrom diagnosis. These are supported both by ethical theory and by\nrequirements that law imposes on the ethics of informed consent. A\nsixth assumption, (6) asymmetry, is fairly widely accepted, but\ncontinues to be debated.\n",
