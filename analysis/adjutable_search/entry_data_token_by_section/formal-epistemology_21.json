    "main_text": "Applications Outside Epistemology || The Existence of God: Fine-tuning\n6.2 The Existence of God: Fine-tuning\n\nThe mathematical theories of probability and decision emerged together\nin correspondence between Blaise Pascale and Pierre de Fermat in the\nmid-17th Century. Pascal went on to apply them to\ntheological questions, developing his famous \u201cwager\u201d\nargument\n (see entry on Pascal\u2019s Wager)\n for belief in God. Probability theory now commonly appears in\ndiscussions of other arguments for and against theism, especially the\nargument from design. Though Darwin is generally thought to have\ntoppled theistic appeals to biological design, newer findings in\ncosmology and physics seem to support a new probabilistic argument for\nGod\u2019s existence.\n\nThe development of the universe from the Big Bang to its present form\ndepended on two factors: the laws of physics and the initial\nconditions at the time of the Big Bang. Both factors appear to have\nbeen carefully arranged so that the universe would be capable of\nsupporting life. Had certain constants in the physical laws been\nslightly different, intelligent life would never have been able to\nevolve. For example, had the forces that bind the nuclei of atoms\ntogether been slightly stronger or weaker, only hydrogen would exist.\nThere would be no carbon, oxygen, or other elements available to form\ncomplex molecules or organisms. Similarly, had the expansion speed of\nthe Big Bang been slightly different, the universe would have either\nsimply collapsed back in on itself soon after the Big Bang, or else\ndispersed into diffuse dust. Stars and planets would never have formed\n(Rees 1999).\n\nThese findings point to a new kind of design argument, one untouched\nby the advent of evolutionary theory. Evolution might explain the\ndesigns we find in the organic world, but what explains the fact that\nour cosmos appears to be \u201cfine-tuned\u201d to allow the\nexistence of (intelligent) life? Apparently, the cosmos actually was\nfine-tuned, by a creator who deliberately designed it so that it would\ncontain (intelligent) life. If there were no such designer, the\nfine-tuning of the cosmos would be a massively improbable\ncoincidence.\n\nTo make this argument rigorous, it\u2019s often formulated in\nprobabilistic terms. Following Sober (2005), we\u2019ll adopt a\nsimple, modest formulation. Let \\(F\\) be the evidence that our\nuniverse is fine-tuned, as just described, and let \\(D\\) be the\n\u201cdesign hypothesis\u201d, the hypothesis that the universe was\ncreated by an intelligent designer with the aim of creating\n(intelligent) life. The argument then runs:\n\n\n\n\\(p(F\\mid D) > p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\)\n\n\nIn general, when \\(p(E\\mid H) > p(E\\mid \\neg H)\\), then \\(E\\)\nsupports \\(H\\) over \\(\\neg H\\).\n\n\nSo \\(F\\) supports \\(D\\) over \\(\\neg D\\).\n\n\nThe argument is plainly valid, so discussion focuses on the\npremises.\n\nThe rationale behind (1) is that \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\) is quite small,\nsince there are so many ways the physical laws and initial constants\ncould have been, almost all of which would have yielded a universe\ninhospitable to life. Without a designer to ensure hospitable\nconstants and conditions, a hospitable outcome would have been\nmassively improbable. But \\(p(F\\mid D)\\), on the other hand, is fairly\nhigh: the envisioned designer\u2019s aim in creating the universe was\nto create life, after all.\n\nTo see the rationale for (2), recall our discussion of confirmation\ntheory\n (\u00a71.2).\n According to our definition of confirmation, evidence confirms a\nhypothesis just in case \\(p(H\\mid E)>p(H)\\), which Bayes\u2019\ntheorem tells us is equivalent to \\(p(E\\mid H) > p(E)\\). Likewise,\n\\(E\\) disconfirms \\(\\neg H\\) just in case \\(p(E) > p(E\\mid\n\\neg H)\\). Now, we can prove that if \\(p(E\\mid H) > p(E)\\), then\n\\(p(E) > p(E\\mid \\neg H)\\). So if \\(E\\) confirms \\(H\\), it\ndisconfirms \\(\\neg H\\), which amounts to \\(E\\) supporting \\(H\\) over\n\\(\\neg H\\).\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to note, however, that \\(E\\) supporting \\(H\\) over\n\\(\\neg H\\) does not mean that, once we learn \\(E\\), \\(H\\)\nbecomes more probable than \\(\\neg H\\). It just means that \\(E\\) raises\nthe probability of \\(H\\) and decreases the probability of \\(\\neg H\\).\nIf \\(H\\) was very improbable to begin with, then \\(E\\) might not\nincrease its probability enough to make it more probable than \\(\\neg\nH\\). This is why our formulation of the argument is so modest. It only\naims to show that \\(F\\) is evidence for \\(D\\) and against \\(\\neg D\\).\nIt makes no claims about how strong the evidence is, or whether it\nshould leave us theists or atheists in the end (Sober 2005). Yet\ncritics argue that even this modest argument is unsound. We\u2019ll\nconsider four such lines of criticism.\n\nOne line of criticism appeals to so-called \u201canthropic\u201d\nconsiderations. The idea is that some findings are a consequence of\nour nature as observers, and thus reflect something about us rather\nthan the phenomena under discussion. For example, I might notice that\nwhenever I observe a physical object, the observation happens while I\nam awake. But I shouldn\u2019t conclude from this that physical\nobjects only exist when I am awake. This feature of my observations\njust reflects something about me: I have to be awake to make these\nobservations. Likewise, these critics argue, we can only observe a\ncosmos that has the features necessary to support (intelligent) life.\nSo our discovery that our universe is fine-tuned only reflects a\nlimitation in us, that we could not observe the opposite (McMullin\n1993; Sober 2005).\n\nProponents of the fine-tuning argument respond that our inability to\nobserve something does not render observations to the contrary\nuninformative. For example, Leslie (1989) notes that someone put\nbefore an expert firing squad cannot observe that they do not survive,\nsince they won\u2019t be alive to make the observation. Yet in the\nunlikely event that they do survive, that\u2019s strong evidence that\nthe squad missed by design. Expert firing squads rarely miss by\naccident. Sober (2005) responds that a firing-squad survivor does\nindeed have evidence, but on a different basis, one that isn\u2019t\navailable to proponents of the design argument. See Monton (2006) and\nSober (2009) for further discussion.\n\nA different line of criticism objects that \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\)\nisn\u2019t low after all: even without a designer, the fine-tuning\ndiscovery was \u201cinevitable\u201d because our universe is just\none in an infinite sequence of universes, oscillating from bang to\ncrunch and back to bang again, with a new set of constants and initial\nconditions emerging at each bang (Wheeler 1973; Leslie 1989). Sooner\nor later, this endless cycle of universal reboots is bound to hit upon\na life-supporting configuration of constants and initial conditions,\nso \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\) may even equal 1, contra premise (1). (How we\ncould know about this endless cycle of universes is a tricky question.\nThe crucial piece of evidence might be that it explains why our\nuniverse is fine-tuned. But then, the same may be true of the design\nhypothesis, \\(D.)\\)\n\nHacking (1987) counters that these \u201coscillating universes\u201d\nonly ensure that some universe at some point in the sequence\nis capable of supporting life. But they make it no more likely that\nthis universe would. At the time of our Big Bang, there were\nstill innumerably life-unfriendly ways things could have started off,\nall equally likely if there was no designer to ensure a life-friendly\nbeginning. Just as rolling a pair of dice over and over again ensures\nthat snake-eyes (both dice coming up 1) will turn up at some point,\nwhatever roll they do turn up on was still extremely unlikely to turn\nout that way. If the 53rd roll comes up snake-eyes, this\nwas hardly inevitable; in fact, it was quite improbable, only a 1 in\n36 chance. Hacking suggests that a different sort of \u201cmultiple\nuniverses\u201d hypothesis escapes this problem: Carter\u2019s\n(1974) hypothesis that all the possible Big Bang-type universes exist\n\u201cside by side\u201d, rather than in an oscillating sequence.\nThen, Hacking suggests, it follows deductively that our universe had\nto exist, so \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\) comes out 1 after all. But White\n(2000) counters that the fallacy in the appeal to Wheeler\u2019s\nmodel afflicts the appeal to Carter\u2019s model too. Even with the\nmultitude of universes existing \u201cside by side\u201d,\nthis one didn\u2019t have to be one of the few with\nlife-friendly parameters.\n\nA third line of criticism attacks the rationale for assigning a low\nnumber to \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\). The complaint is that the rationale\nactually makes \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)=0\\), and also assigns probability 0\nto many other, intuitively much more probable, ways the universe might\nhave turned out. How so? The rationale for a low \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)\\)\ngoes something like this: take an apparently fine-tuned parameter of\nour universe, like its expansion speed. This speed had to be exactly\nbetween 9 and 10 km/sc, let\u2019s pretend, for the universe to be\nable to support life. But given that it could have been any speed from\n0 km/sc to 100 km/sc to \\(1,000,000\\) km/sc to\u2026that it would\nend up in the narrow 9\u201310 km/sc window was extremely unlikely to\nhappen without divine guidance. But, the objection goes, the same\ncould be said of much larger ranges, like a \\(10^1\\)\u2013\\(10^{10}\\)\nkm/sc window. Even that large range is a drop in the infinite bucket\nof speeds that could have obtained, from 0 through the entire positive\nreal line. In fact, any finite range is effectively 0% of\ninfinity\u2014indeed, it really is \\(0\\%\\) on the standard ways of\nmeasuring these things (Colyvan, Garfield, and Priest 2005). So even\nif our universe only needed \u201ccoarse tuning\u201d to support\nlife, i.e., even if it would have supported life given any of a\nmassively broad yet finite range of conditions, a parallel premise to\n(1) could be justified by this rationale, and a corresponding\n\u201ccoarse-tuning argument\u201d for design offered (McGrew,\nMcGrew, and Vestrup 2001).\n\nCollins (2009) points out an uncomfortable consequence of this\nobjection, that the fine-tuning argument would be compelling if only\n\\(\\neg D\\) were more life-friendly. Imagine that the laws of\nphysics only permitted a finite range of possible expansion speeds,\nsay 0\u2013100 km/s, with a speed of 9\u201310 km/s required to\nsupport life. Then premise (1) would hold and the fine-tuning argument\nwould succeed: \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)=1/100\\), with \\(p(F\\mid D)\\)\npresumably much higher, maybe even 1. Now imagine the possible range\nto be much larger, say 0\u2013\\(10^{10}\\) km/s. The argument then\nbecomes even stronger, with \\(p(F\\mid \\neg D)=1/10^{10}\\). As the\nupper limit on possible expansion speeds increases, the argument\nbecomes stronger and stronger\u2026until the limit becomes infinite,\nat which point the argument fails, according to the present\nobjection.\n",
