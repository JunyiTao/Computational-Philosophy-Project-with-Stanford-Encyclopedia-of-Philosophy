Buddha as Philosopher\n\nThis entry concerns the historical individual, traditionally called\nGautama, who is identified by modern scholars as the founder of\nBuddhism. According to Buddhist teachings, there have been other\nbuddhas in the past, and there will be yet more in the future. The\ntitle \u2018Buddha\u2019, which literally means\n\u2018awakened\u2019, is conferred on an individual who discovers\nthe path to nirvana, the cessation of suffering, and propagates that\ndiscovery so that others may also achieve nirvana. This entry\nwill follow modern scholarship in taking an agnostic stance on the\nquestion of whether there have been other buddhas, and likewise for\nquestions concerning the superhuman status and powers that some\nBuddhists attribute to buddhas. The concern of this entry is just\nthose aspects of the thought of the historical individual Gautama that\nbear on the development of the Buddhist philosophical tradition.\n\nThe Buddha will here be treated as a philosopher. To so treat him is\ncontroversial, but before coming to why that should be so, let us\nfirst rehearse those basic aspects of the Buddha\u2019s life and\nteachings that are relatively non-controversial. Tradition has it that\nGautama lived to age 80. Up until recently his dates were thought to\nbe approximately 560\u2013480 BCE, but many scholars now hold that he\nmust have died around 405 BCE. He was born into a family of some\nwealth and power, members of the \u015a\u0101kya clan, in the area of\nthe present border between India and Nepal. The story is that in early\nadulthood he abandoned his comfortable life as a householder (as well\nas his wife and young son) in order to seek a solution to the problem\nof existential suffering. He first took up with a number of different\nwandering ascetics (\u015bramanas) who claimed to know the\npath to liberation from suffering. Finding their teachings\nunsatisfactory, he struck out on his own, and through a combination of\ninsight and meditational practice attained the state of enlightenment\n(bodhi) which is said to represent the cessation of all\nfurther suffering. He then devoted the remaining 45 years of his life\nto teaching others the insights and techniques that had led him to\nthis achievement.\n\nGautama could himself be classified as one of the\n\u015bramanas. That there existed such a phenomenon as the\n\u015bramanas tells us that there was some degree of\ndissatisfaction with the customary religious practices then prevailing\nin the Gangetic basin of North India. These practices consisted\nlargely in the rituals and sacrifices prescribed in the Vedas. Among\nthe \u015bramanas there were many, including the Buddha, who\nrejected the authority of the Vedas as definitive pronouncements on\nthe nature of the world and our place in it (and for this reason are\ncalled \u2018heterodox\u2019). But within the Vedic canon itself\nthere is a stratum of (comparatively late) texts, the\nUpani\u1e63ads, that likewise displays disaffection with\nBrahmin ritualism. Among the new ideas that figure in these\n(\u2018orthodox\u2019) texts, as well as in the teachings of those\nheterodox \u015bramanas whose doctrines are known to us, are\nthe following: that sentient beings (including humans, non-human\nanimals, gods, and the inhabitants of various hells) undergo rebirth;\nthat rebirth is governed by the causal laws of karma (good actions\ncause pleasant fruit for the agent, evil actions cause unpleasant\nfruit, etc.); that continual rebirth is inherently unsatisfactory;\nthat there is an ideal state for sentient beings involving liberation\nfrom the cycle of rebirth; and that attaining this state requires\novercoming ignorance concerning one\u2019s true identity. Various\nviews are offered concerning this ignorance and how to overcome it.\nThe Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101 (classified by some orthodox\nschools as an Upani\u1e63ad) lists four such methods, and\ndiscusses at least two separate views concerning our identity: that\nthere is a plurality of distinct selves, each being the true agent of\na person\u2019s actions and the bearer of karmic merit and demerit\nbut existing separately from the body and its associated states; and\nthat there is just one self, of the nature of pure consciousness (a\n\u2018witness\u2019) and identical with the essence of the cosmos,\nBrahman or pure undifferentiated Being.\n\nThe Buddha agreed with those of his contemporaries embarked on the\nsame soteriological project that it is ignorance about our identity\nthat is responsible for suffering. What sets his teachings apart (at\nthis level of analysis) lies in what he says that ignorance consists\nin: the conceit that there is an \u2018I\u2019 and a\n\u2018mine\u2019. This is the famous Buddhist teaching of non-self\n(an\u0101tman). And it is with this teaching that the\ncontroversy begins concerning whether Gautama may legitimately be\nrepresented as a philosopher. First there are those (e.g. Albahari\n2006) who (correctly) point out that the Buddha never categorically\ndenies the existence of a self that transcends what is empirically\ngiven, namely the five skandhas or psychophysical elements.\nWhile the Buddha does deny that any of the psychophysical elements is\na self, these interpreters claim that he at least leaves open the\npossibility that there is a self that is transcendent in the sense of\nbeing non-empirical. To this it may be objected that all of classical\nIndian philosophy\u2014Buddhist and orthodox alike\u2014understood\nthe Buddha to have denied the self tout court. To this it is\nsometimes replied that the later philosophical tradition simply got\nthe Buddha wrong, at least in part because the Buddha sought to\nindicate something that cannot be grasped through the exercise of\nphilosophical rationality. On this interpretation, the Buddha should\nbe seen not as a proponent of the philosophical methods of analysis\nand argumentation, but rather as one who sees those methods as\nobstacles to final release.\n\nAnother reason one sometimes encounters for denying that the Buddha is\na philosopher is that he rejects the characteristically philosophical\nactivity of theorizing about matters that lack evident practical\napplication. On this interpretation as well, those later Buddhist\nthinkers who did go in for the construction of theories about the\nultimate nature of everything simply failed to heed or properly\nappreciate the Buddha\u2019s advice that we avoid theorizing for its\nown sake and confine our attention to those matters that are directly\nrelevant to liberation from suffering. On this view the teaching of\nnon-self is not a bit of metaphysics, just some practical advice to\nthe effect that we should avoid identifying with things that are\ntransitory and so bound to yield dissatisfaction. What both\ninterpretations share is the assumption that it is possible to arrive\nat what the Buddha himself thought without relying on the\nunderstanding of his teachings developed in the subsequent Buddhist\nphilosophical tradition.\n\nThis assumption may be questioned. Our knowledge of the Buddha\u2019s\nteachings comes by way of texts that were not written down until\nseveral centuries after his death, are in languages (P\u0101li, and\nChinese translations of Sanskrit) other than the one he is likely to\nhave spoken, and disagree in important respects. The first difficulty\nmay not be as serious as it seems, given that the Buddha\u2019s\ndiscourses were probably rehearsed shortly after his death and\npreserved through oral transmission until the time they were committed\nto writing. And the second need not be insuperable either. (See, e.g.,\nCousins 2022.) But the third is troubling, in that it suggests\ntextual transmission involved processes of insertion and deletion in\naid of one side or another in sectarian disputes. Our ancient sources\nattest to this: one will encounter a dispute among Buddhist thinkers\nwhere one side cites some utterance of the Buddha in support of their\nposition, only to have the other side respond that the text from which\nthe quotation is taken is not universally recognized as\nauthoritatively the word of the Buddha. This suggests that our record\nof the Buddha\u2019s teaching may be colored by the philosophical\nelaboration of those teachings propounded by later thinkers in the\nBuddhist tradition.\n\nSome scholars (e.g., Gombrich 2009, Shulman 2014) are more sanguine\nthan others about the possibility of overcoming this difficulty, and\nthereby getting at what the Buddha himself had thought, as opposed to\nwhat later Buddhist philosophers thought he had thought. No position\nwill be taken on this dispute here. We will be treating the\nBuddha\u2019s thought as it was understood within the later\nphilosophical tradition that he had inspired. The resulting\ninterpretation may or may not be faithful to his intentions. It is at\nleast logically possible that he believed there to be a transcendent\nself that can only be known by mystical intuition, or that the\nexercise of philosophical rationality leads only to sterile theorizing\nand away from real emancipation. What we can say with some assurance\nis that this is not how the Buddhist philosophical tradition\nunderstood him. It is their understanding that will be the subject of\nthis essay.\n2. Core Teachings\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s basic teachings are usually summarized using the\ndevice of the Four Nobles\u2019 Truths:\n\nThere is suffering.\nThere is the origination of suffering.\nThere is the cessation of suffering.\nThere is a path to the cessation of suffering.\n\n\nThe first of these claims might seem obvious, even when\n\u2018suffering\u2019 is understood to mean not mere pain but\nexistential suffering, the sort of frustration, alienation and despair\nthat arise out of our experience of transitoriness. But there are said\nto be different levels of appreciation of this truth, some quite\nsubtle and difficult to attain; the highest of these is said to\ninvolve the realization that everything is of the nature of suffering.\nPerhaps it is sufficient for present purposes to point out that while\nthis is not the implausible claim that all of life\u2019s states and\nevents are necessarily experienced as unsatisfactory, still the\nrealization that all (oneself included) is impermanent can undermine a\nprecondition for real enjoyment of the events in a life: that such\nevents are meaningful by virtue of their having a place in an\nopen-ended narrative.\n\nIt is with the development and elaboration of (2) that substantive\nphilosophical controversy begins. (2) is the simple claim that there\nare causes and conditions for the arising of suffering. (3) then makes\nthe obvious point that if the origination of suffering depends on\ncauses, future suffering can be prevented by bringing about the\ncessation of those causes. (4) specifies a set of techniques that are\nsaid to be effective in such cessation. Much then hangs on the correct\nidentification of the causes of suffering. The answer is traditionally\nspelled out in a list consisting of twelve links in a causal chain\nthat begins with ignorance and ends with suffering (represented by the\nstates of old age, disease and death). Modern scholarship has\nestablished that this list is a later compilation. For the texts that\nclaim to convey the Buddha\u2019s own teachings give two slightly\ndifferent formulations of this list, and shorter formulations\ncontaining only some of the twelve items are also found in the texts.\nBut it seems safe to say that the Buddha taught an analysis of the\norigins of suffering roughly along the following lines: given the\nexistence of a fully functioning assemblage of psychophysical elements\n(the parts that make up a sentient being), ignorance concerning the\nthree characteristics of sentient existence\u2014suffering,\nimpermanence and non-self\u2014will lead, in the course of normal\ninteractions with the environment, to appropriation (the\nidentification of certain elements as \u2018I\u2019 and\n\u2018mine\u2019). This leads in turn to the formation of\nattachments, in the form of desire and aversion, and the strengthening\nof ignorance concerning the true nature of sentient existence. These\nensure future rebirth, and thus future instances of old age, disease\nand death, in a potentially unending cycle.\n\nThe key to escape from this cycle is said to lie in realization of the\ntruth about sentient existence\u2014that it is characterized by\nsuffering, impermanence and non-self. But this realization is not\neasily achieved, since acts of appropriation have already made desire,\naversion and ignorance deeply entrenched habits of mind. Thus the\nmeasures specified in (4) include various forms of training designed\nto replace such habits with others that are more conducive to seeing\nthings as they are. Among these is training in meditation, which\nserves among other things as a way of enhancing one\u2019s\nobservational abilities with respect to one\u2019s own\npsychological states. Insight is cultivated through the use of these\nnewly developed observational powers, as informed by knowledge\nacquired through the exercise of philosophical rationality. There is a\ndebate in the later tradition as to whether final release can be\nattained through theoretical insight alone, through meditation alone,\nor only by using both techniques. Ch\u2019an, for instance, is based\non the premise that enlightenment can be attained through meditation\nalone, whereas Therav\u0101da advocates using both but also holds that\nanalysis alone may be sufficient for some. (This disagreement begins\nwith a dispute over how to interpret D I.77\u201384; see Cousins\n2022, 81\u20136.) The third option seems the most plausible, but the first\nis certainly of some interest given its suggestion that one can attain\nthe ideal state for humans just by doing philosophy.\n\nThe Buddha seems to have held (2) to constitute the core of his\ndiscovery. He calls his teachings a \u2018middle path\u2019 between\ntwo extreme views, and it is this claim concerning the causal origins\nof suffering that he identifies as the key to avoiding those extremes.\nThe extremes are eternalism, the view that persons are eternal, and\nannihilationism, the view that persons go utterly out of existence\n(usually understood to mean at death, though a term still shorter than\none lifetime is not ruled out). It will be apparent that eternalism\nrequires the existence of the sort of self that the Buddha denies.\nWhat is not immediately evident is why the denial of such a self is\nnot tantamount to the claim that the person is annihilated at death\n(or even sooner, depending on just how impermanent one takes the\npsychophysical elements to be). The solution to this puzzle lies in\nthe fact that eternalism and annihilationism both share the\npresupposition that there is an \u2018I\u2019 whose existence might\neither extend beyond death or terminate at death. The idea of the\n\u2018middle path\u2019 is that all of life\u2019s continuities can\nbe explained in terms of facts about a causal series of psychophysical\nelements. There being nothing more than a succession of these\nimpermanent, impersonal events and states, the question of the\nultimate fate of this \u2018I\u2019, the supposed owner of these\nelements, simply does not arise.\n\nThis reductionist view of sentient beings was later articulated in\nterms of the distinction between two kinds of truth, conventional and\nultimate. Each kind of truth has its own domain of objects, the things\nthat are only conventionally real and the things that are ultimately\nreal respectively. Conventionally real entities are those things that\nare accepted as real by common sense, but that turn out on further\nanalysis to be wholes compounded out of simpler entities and thus not\nstrictly speaking real at all. The stock example of a conventionally\nreal entity is the chariot, which we take to be real only because it\nis more convenient, given our interests and cognitive limitations, to\nhave a single name for the parts when assembled in the right way.\nSince our belief that there are chariots is thus due to our having a\ncertain useful concept, the chariot is said to be a mere conceptual\nfiction. (This does not, however, mean that all conceptualization is\nfalsification; only concepts that allow of reductive analysis lead to\nthis artificial inflation of our ontology, and thus to a kind of\nerror.) Ultimately real entities are those ultimate parts into which\nconceptual fictions are analyzable. An ultimately true statement is\none that correctly describes how certain ultimately real entities are\narranged. A conventionally true statement is one that, given how the\nultimately real entities are arranged, would correctly describe\ncertain conceptual fictions if they also existed. The ultimate truth\nconcerning the relevant ultimately real entities helps explain why it\nshould turn out to be useful to accept conventionally true statements\n(such as \u2018King Milinda rode in a chariot\u2019) when the\nobjects described in those statements are mere fictions.\n\nUsing this distinction between the two truths, the key insight of the\n\u2018middle path\u2019 may be expressed as follows. The ultimate\ntruth about sentient beings is just that there is a causal series of\nimpermanent, impersonal psychophysical elements. Since these are all\nimpermanent, and lack other properties that would be required of an\nessence of the person, none of them is a self. But given the right\narrangement of such entities in a causal series, it is useful to think\nof them as making up one thing, a person. It is thus conventionally\ntrue that there are persons, things that endure for a lifetime and\npossibly (if there is rebirth) longer. This is conventionally true\nbecause generally speaking there is more overall happiness and less\noverall pain and suffering when one part of such a series identifies\nwith other parts of the same series. For instance, when the present\nset of psychophysical elements identifies with future elements, it is\nless likely to engage in behavior (such as smoking) that results in\npresent pleasure but far greater future pain. The utility of this\nconvention is, however, limited. Past a certain point\u2014namely the\npoint at which we take it too seriously, as more than just a useful\nfiction\u2014it results in existential suffering. The cessation of\nsuffering is attained by extirpating all sense of an \u2018I\u2019\nthat serves as agent and owner.\n3. Non-Self\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s \u2018middle path\u2019 strategy can be seen as\none of first arguing that since the word \u2018I\u2019 is a mere enumerative\nterm like \u2018pair\u2019, there is nothing that it genuinely\ndenotes; and then explaining that our erroneous sense of an\n\u2018I\u2019 stems from our employment of the useful fiction\nrepresented by the concept of the person. While the second part of\nthis strategy only receives its full articulation in the later\ndevelopment of the theory of two truths, the first part can be found\nin the Buddha\u2019s own teachings, in the form of several\nphilosophical arguments for non-self. Best known among these is the\nargument from impermanence (S III.66\u20138), which has this basic\nstructure:\n\n1.\nIf there were a self it would be permanent.\n2.\nNone of the five kinds of psychophysical element is\npermanent.\n\u2234\nThere is no self.\n\n\nIt is the fact that this argument does not contain a premise\nexplicitly asserting that the five skandhas (classes of\npsychophysical element) are exhaustive of the constituents of persons,\nplus the fact that these are all said to be empirically observable,\nthat leads some to claim that the Buddha did not intend to deny the\nexistence of a self tout court. There is, however, evidence\nthat the Buddha was generally hostile toward attempts to establish the\nexistence of unobservable entities. In the Pohap\u0101da Sutta (D\nI.178\u2013203), for instance, the Buddha compares someone who posits\nan unseen seer in order to explain our introspective awareness of\ncognitions, to a man who has conceived a longing for the most\nbeautiful woman in the world based solely on the thought that such a\nwoman must surely exist. And in the Tevijja Sutta (D I.235\u201352),\nthe Buddha rejects the claim of certain Brahmins to know the path to\noneness with Brahman, on the grounds that no one has actually observed\nthis Brahman. This makes more plausible the assumption that the\nargument has as an implicit premise the claim that there is no more to\nthe person than the five skandhas.\n\nPremise (1) appears to be based on the assumption that persons undergo\nrebirth, together with the thought that one function of a self would\nbe to account for diachronic personal identity. By\n\u2018permanent\u2019 is here meant continued existence over at\nleast several lives. This is shown by the fact that the Buddha rules\nout the body as a self on the grounds that the body exists for just\none lifetime. (This also demonstrates that the Buddha did not mean by\n\u2018impermanent\u2019 what some later Buddhist philosophers meant,\nviz., existing for just a moment; the Buddhist doctrine of\nmomentariness represents a later development.) The mental entities\nthat make up the remaining four types of psychophysical element might\nseem like more promising candidates, but these are ruled out on the\ngrounds that these all originate in dependence on contact between\nsense faculty and object, and last no longer than a particular\nsense-object-contact event. That he listed five kinds of\npsychophysical element, and not just one, shows that the Buddha\nembraced a kind of dualism. But this strategy for demonstrating the\nimpermanence of the psychological elements shows that his dualism was\nnot the sort of mind-body dualism familiar from substance ontologies\nlike those of Descartes and of the Ny\u0101ya school of orthodox\nIndian philosophy. Instead of seeing the mind as the persisting bearer\nof such transient events as occurrences of cognition, feeling and\nvolition, he treats \u2018mind\u2019 as a kind of aggregate term for\nbundles of transient mental events. These events being impermanent,\nthey too fail to account for diachronic personal identity in the way\nin which a self might be expected to.\n\nAnother argument for non-self, which might be called the argument from\ncontrol (S III.66\u20138), has this structure:\n\n1.\nIf there were a self, one could never desire that it be\nchanged.\n2.\nEach of the five kinds of psychophysical element is such that one\ncan desire that it be changed.\n\u2234\nThere is no self.\n\n\nPremise (1) is puzzling. It appears to presuppose that the self should\nhave complete control over itself, so that it would effortlessly\nadjust its state to its desires. That the self should be thought of as\nthe locus of control is certainly plausible. Those Indian\nself-theorists who claim that the self is a mere passive witness\nrecognize that the burden of proof is on them to show that the self is\nnot an agent. But it seems implausibly demanding to require of the\nself that it have complete control over itself. We do not require that\nvision see itself if it is to see other things. The case of vision\nsuggests an alternative interpretation, however. We might hold that\nvision does not see itself for the reason that this would violate an\nirreflexivity principle, to the effect that an entity cannot operate\non itself. Indian philosophers who accept this principle cite\nsupportive instances such as the knife that cannot cut itself and the\nfinger-tip that cannot touch itself. If this principle is accepted,\nthen if the self were the locus of control it would follow that it\ncould never exercise this function on itself. A self that was the\ncontroller could never find itself in the position of seeking to\nchange its state to one that it deemed more desirable. On this\ninterpretation, the first premise seems to be true. And there is ample\nevidence that (2) is true: it is difficult to imagine a bodily or\npsychological state over which one might not wish to exercise control.\nConsequently, given the assumption that the person is wholly composed\nof the psychophysical elements, it appears to follow that a self of\nthis description does not exist.\n\nThese two arguments appear, then, to give good reason to deny a self\nthat might ground diachronic personal identity and serve as locus of\ncontrol, given the assumption that there is no more to the person than\nthe empirically given psychophysical elements. But it now becomes\nsomething of a puzzle how one is to explain diachronic personal\nidentity and agency. To start with the latter, does the argument from\ncontrol not suggest that control must be exercised by something other\nthan the psychophysical elements? This was precisely the conclusion of\nthe S\u0101\u1e43khya school of orthodox Indian philosophy. One of\ntheir arguments for the existence of a self was that it is possible to\nexercise control over all the empirically given constituents of the\nperson; while they agree with the Buddha that a self is never\nobserved, they take the phenomena of agency to be grounds for positing\na self that transcends all possible experience.\n\nThis line of objection to the Buddha\u2019s teaching of non-self is\nmore commonly formulated in response to the argument from\nimpermanence, however. Perhaps its most dramatic form is aimed at the\nBuddha\u2019s acceptance of the doctrines of karma and rebirth. It is\nclear that the body ceases to exist at death. And given the\nBuddha\u2019s argument that mental states all originate in dependence\non sense-object contact events, it seems no psychological constituent\nof the person can transmigrate either. Yet the Buddha claims that\npersons who have not yet achieved enlightenment will be reborn as\nsentient beings of some sort after they die. If there is no\nconstituent whatever that moves from one life to the next, how could\nthe being in the next life be the same person as the being in this\nlife? This question becomes all the more pointed when it is added that\nrebirth is governed by karma, something that functions as a kind of\ncosmic justice: those born into fortunate circumstances do so as a\nresult of good deeds in prior lives, while unpleasant births result\nfrom evil past deeds. Such a system of reward and punishment could be\njust only if the recipient of pleasant or unpleasant karmic fruit is\nthe same person as the agent of the good or evil action. And the\nopponent finds it incomprehensible how this could be so in the absence\nof a persisting self.\n4. Karma and Rebirth\n\nIt is not just classical Indian self-theorists who have found this\nobjection persuasive. Some Buddhists have as well. Among these\nBuddhists, however, this has led to the rejection not of non-self but\nof rebirth. (Historically this response was not unknown among East\nAsian Buddhists, and it is not rare among Western Buddhists today.)\nThe evidence that the Buddha himself accepted rebirth and karma seems\nquite strong, however. The later tradition would distinguish between\ntwo types of discourse in the body of the Buddha\u2019s teachings:\nthose intended for an audience of householders seeking instruction\nfrom a sage, and those intended for an audience of monastic\nrenunciates already versed in his teachings. And it would be one thing\nif his use of the concepts of karma and rebirth were limited to the\nformer. For then such appeals could be explained away as another\ninstance of the Buddha\u2019s pedagogical skill (commonly referred to\nas up\u0101ya). The idea would be that householders who fail\nto comply with the most basic demands of morality are not likely (for\nreasons to be discussed shortly) to make significant progress toward\nthe cessation of suffering, and the teaching of karma and rebirth,\neven if not strictly speaking true, does give those who accept it a\n(prudential) reason to be moral. But this sort of \u2018noble\nlie\u2019 justification for the Buddha teaching a doctrine he does\nnot accept fails in the face of the evidence that he also taught it to\nquite advanced monastics (e.g., A III.33). And what he taught is not\nthe version of karma popular in certain circles today, according to\nwhich, for instance, an act done out of hatred makes the agent\nsomewhat more disposed to perform similar actions out of similar\nmotives in the future, which in turn makes negative experiences more\nlikely for the agent. What the Buddha teaches is instead the far\nstricter view that each action has its own specific consequence for\nthe agent, the hedonic nature of which is determined in accordance\nwith causal laws and in such a way as to require rebirth as long as\naction continues. So if there is a conflict between the doctrine of\nnon-self and the teaching of karma and rebirth, it is not to be\nresolved by weakening the Buddha\u2019s commitment to the latter.\n\nThe Sanskrit term karma literally means \u2018action\u2019.\nWhat is nowadays referred to somewhat loosely as the theory of karma\nis, speaking more strictly, the view that there is a causal\nrelationship between action (karma) and \u2018fruit\u2019\n(phala), the latter being an experience of pleasure, pain or\nindifference for the agent of the action. This is the view that the\nBuddha appears to have accepted in its most straightforward form.\nActions are said to be of three types: bodily, verbal and mental. The\nBuddha insists, however, that by action is meant not the movement or\nchange involved, but rather the volition or intention that brought\nabout the change. As Gombrich (2009) points out, the Buddha\u2019s\ninsistence on this point reflects the transition from an earlier\nritualistic view of action to a view that brings action within the\npurview of ethics. For it is when actions are seen as subject to moral\nassessment that intention becomes relevant. One does not, for\ninstance, perform the morally blameworthy action of speaking\ninsultingly to an elder just by making sounds that approximate to the\npronunciation of profanities in the presence of an elder; parrots and\nprelinguistic children can do as much. What matters for moral\nassessment is the mental state (if any) that produced the bodily,\nverbal or mental change. And it is the occurrence of these mental\nstates that is said to cause the subsequent occurrence of hedonically\ngood, bad and neutral experiences. More specifically, it is the\noccurrence of the three \u2018defiled\u2019 mental states that\nbrings about karmic fruit. The three defilements\n(kle\u015bas) are desire, aversion and ignorance. And we are\ntold quite specifically (A III.33) that actions performed by an agent\nin whom these three defilements have been destroyed do not have karmic\nconsequences; such an agent is experiencing their last birth.\n\nSome caution is required in understanding this claim about the\ndefilements. The Buddha seems to be saying that it is possible to act\nnot only without ignorance, but also in the absence of desire or\naversion, yet it is difficult to see how there could be intentional\naction without some positive or negative motivation. To see\none\u2019s way around this difficulty, one must realize that by\n\u2018desire\u2019 and \u2018aversion\u2019 are meant those\npositive and negative motives respectively that are colored by\nignorance, viz. ignorance concerning suffering, impermanence and\nnon-self. Presumably the enlightened person, while knowing the truth\nabout these matters, can still engage in motivated action. Their\nactions are not based on the presupposition that there is an\n\u2018I\u2019 for which those actions can have significance.\nIgnorance concerning these matters perpetuates rebirth, and thus\nfurther occasions for existential suffering, by facilitating a\nmotivational structure that reinforces one\u2019s ignorance. We can\nnow see how compliance with common-sense morality could be seen as an\ninitial step on the path to the cessation of suffering. While the\npresence of ignorance makes all action\u2014even that deemed morally\ngood\u2014karmically potent, those actions commonly considered\nmorally evil are especially powerful reinforcers of ignorance, in that\nthey stem from the assumption that the agent\u2019s welfare is of\nparamount importance. While recognition of the moral value of others\nmay still involve the conceit that there is an \u2018I\u2019, it can\nnonetheless constitute progress toward dissolution of the sense of\nself.\n\nThis excursus into what the Buddha meant by karma may help us see how\nhis middle path strategy could be used to reply to the objection to\nnon-self from rebirth. That objection was that the reward and\npunishment generated by karma across lives could never be deserved in\nthe absence of a transmigrating self. The middle path strategy\ngenerally involves locating and rejecting an assumption shared by a\npair of extreme views. In this case the views will be (1) that the\nperson in the later life deserves the fruit generated by the action in\nthe earlier life, and (2) that this person does not deserve the fruit.\nOne assumption shared by (1) and (2) is that persons deserve reward\nand punishment depending on the moral character of their actions, and\none might deny this assumption. But that would be tantamount to moral\nnihilism, and a middle path is said to avoid nihilisms (such as\nannihilationism). A more promising alternative might be to deny that\nthere are ultimately such things as persons that could bear moral\nproperties like desert. This is what the Buddha seems to mean when he\nasserts that the earlier and the later person are neither the same nor\ndifferent (S II.62; S II.76; S II.113). Since any two existing things\nmust be either identical or distinct, to say of the two persons that\nthey are neither is to say that strictly speaking they do not\nexist.\n\nThis alternative is more promising because it avoids moral nihilism.\nFor it allows one to assert that persons and their moral properties\nare conventionally real. To say this is to say that given our\ninterests and cognitive limitations, we do better at achieving our\naim\u2014minimizing overall pain and suffering\u2014by acting as\nthough there are persons with morally significant properties.\nUltimately there are just impersonal entities and events in causal\nsequence: ignorance, the sorts of desires that ignorance facilitates,\nan intention formed on the basis of such a desire, a bodily, verbal or\nmental action, a feeling of pleasure, pain or indifference, and an\noccasion of suffering. The claim is that this situation is usefully\nthought of as, for instance, a person who performs an evil deed due to\ntheir ignorance of the true nature of things, receives the unpleasant\nfruit they deserve in the next life, and suffers through their\ncontinuing on the wheel of sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. It is useful to think\nof the situation in this way because it helps us locate the\nappropriate places to intervene to prevent future pain (the evil deed)\nand future suffering (ignorance).\n\nIt is no doubt quite difficult to believe that karma and rebirth exist\nin the form that the Buddha claims. It is said that their existence\ncan be confirmed by those who have developed the power of\nretrocognition through advanced yogic technique. But this is of little\nhelp to those not already convinced that meditation is a reliable\nmeans of knowledge. What can be said with some assurance is that karma\nand rebirth are not inconsistent with non-self. Rebirth without\ntransmigration is logically possible.\n5. Attitude toward Reason\n\nWhen the Buddha says that a person in one life and the person in\nanother life are neither the same nor different, one\u2019s first\nresponse might be to take \u2018different\u2019 to mean something\nother than \u2018not the same\u2019. But while this is possible in\nEnglish given the ambiguity of \u2018the same\u2019, it is not\npossible in the P\u0101li source, where the Buddha is represented as\nunambiguously denying both numerical identity and numerical\ndistinctness. This has led some to wonder whether the Buddha does not\nemploy a deviant logic. Such suspicions are strengthened by those\ncases where the options are not two but four, cases of the so-called\ntetralemma (catu\u1e63ko\u1e6di). For instance, when the\nBuddha is questioned about the post-mortem status of the enlightened\nperson or arhat (e.g., at M I.483\u20138) the possibilities\nare listed as: (1) the arhat continues to exist after death,\n(2) does not exist after death, (3) both exists and does not exist\nafter death, and (4) neither exists nor does not exist after death.\nWhen the Buddha rejects both (1) and (2) we get a repetition of\n\u2018neither the same nor different\u2019. But when he goes on to\nentertain, and then reject, (3) and (4) the logical difficulties are\ncompounded. Since each of (3) and (4) appears to be formally\ncontradictory, to entertain either is to entertain the possibility\nthat a contradiction might be true. And their denial seems tantamount\nto affirmation of excluded middle, which is prima facie\nincompatible with the denial of both (1) and (2). One might wonder\nwhether we are here in the presence of the mystical.\n\nThere were some Buddhist philosophers who took \u2018neither the same\nnor different\u2019 in this way. These were the Personalists\n(Pudgalav\u0101dins), who were so called because they\naffirmed the ultimate existence of the person as something named and\nconceptualized in dependence on the psychophysical elements. They\nclaimed that the person is neither identical with nor distinct from\nthe psychophysical elements. They were prepared to accept, as a\nconsequence, that nothing whatever can be said about the relation\nbetween person and elements. But their view was rejected by most\nBuddhist philosophers, in part on the grounds that it quickly leads to\nan ineffability paradox: one can say neither that the person\u2019s\nrelation to the elements is inexpressible, nor that it is not\ninexpressible. The consensus view was instead that the fact that the\nperson can be said to be neither identical with nor distinct from the\nelements is grounds for taking the person to be a mere conceptual\nfiction. Concerning the persons in the two lives, they understood the\nnegations involved in \u2018neither the same nor different\u2019 to\nbe of the commitmentless variety, i.e., to function like illocutionary\nnegation. If we agree that the statement \u20187 is green\u2019 is\nsemantically ill-formed, on the grounds that abstract objects such as\nnumbers do not have colors, then we might go on to say, \u2018Do not\nsay that 7 is green, and do not say that it is not green\neither\u2019. There is no contradiction here, since the illocutionary\nnegation operator \u2018do not say\u2019 generates no commitment to\nan alternative characterization.\n\nThere is also evidence that claims of type (3) involve\nparameterization. For instance, the claim about the arhat\nwould be that there is some respect in which they can be said to exist\nafter death, and some other respect in which they can be said to no\nlonger exist after death. Entertaining such a proposition does not\nrequire that one believe there might be true contradictions. And while\nclaims of type (4) would seem to be logically equivalent to those of\ntype (3) (regardless of whether or not they involve parameterization),\nthe tradition treated this type as asserting that the subject is\nbeyond all conceptualization. To reject the type (4) claim about the\narhat is to close off one natural response to the rejections\nof the first three claims: that the status of the arhat after\ndeath transcends rational understanding. That the Buddha rejected all\nfour possibilities concerning this and related questions is not\nevidence that he employed a deviant logic.\n\nThe Buddha\u2019s response to questions like those concerning the\narhat is sometimes cited in defense of a different claim\nabout his attitude toward rationality. This is the claim that the\nBuddha was essentially a pragmatist, someone who rejects philosophical\ntheorizing for its own sake and employs philosophical rationality only\nto the extent that doing so can help solve the practical problem of\neliminating suffering. The Buddha does seem to be embracing something\nlike this attitude when he defends his refusal to answer questions\nlike that about the arhat, or whether the series of lives has\na beginning, or whether the living principle (j\u012bva) is\nidentical with the body. He calls all the possible views with respect\nto such questions distractions insofar as answering them would not\nlead to the cessation of the defilements and thus to the end of\nsuffering. And in a famous simile (M I.429) he compares someone who\ninsists that the Buddha answer these questions to someone who has been\nwounded by an arrow but will not have the wound treated until they are\ntold who shot the arrow, what sort of wood the arrow is made of, and\nthe like.\n\nPassages such as these surely attest to the great importance the\nBuddha placed on sharing his insights to help others overcome\nsuffering. But this is consistent with the belief that philosophical\nrationality may be used to answer questions that lack evident\nconnection with pressing practical concerns. And on at least one\noccasion the Buddha does just this. Pressed to give his answers to the\nquestions about the arhat and the like, the Buddha first\nrejects all the possibilities of the tetralemma, and defends his\nrefusal on the grounds that such theories are not conducive to\nliberation from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra. But when his questioner\nshows signs of thereby losing confidence in the value of the\nBuddha\u2019s teachings about the path to the cessation of suffering,\nthe Buddha responds with the example of a fire that goes out after\nexhausting its fuel. If one were asked where this fire has gone, the\nBuddha points out, one could consistently deny that it has gone to the\nnorth, to the south, or in any other direction. This is so for the\nsimple reason that the questions \u2018Has it gone to the\nnorth?\u2019, \u2018Has it gone to the south?\u2019, etc., all\nshare the false presupposition that the fire continues to exist.\nLikewise the questions about the arhat and the like all share\nthe false presupposition that there is such a thing as a person who\nmight either continue to exist after death, cease to exist at death,\netc. (An\u0101layo 2018, 41) The difficulty with these questions is\nnot that they try to extend philosophical rationality beyond its\nlegitimate domain, as the handmaiden of soteriologically useful\npractice. It is rather that they rest on a false\npresupposition\u2014something that is disclosed through the\nemployment of philosophical rationality.\n\nA different sort of challenge to the claim that the Buddha valued\nphilosophical rationality for its own sake comes from the role played\nby authority in Buddhist soteriology. For instance, in the Buddhist\ntradition one sometimes encounters the claim that only enlightened\npersons such as the Buddha can know all the details of karmic\ncausation. And to the extent that the moral rules are thought to be\ndetermined by the details of karmic causation, this might be taken to\nmean that our knowledge of the moral rules is dependent on the\nauthority of the Buddha. Again, the subsequent development of Buddhist\nphilosophy seems to have been constrained by the need to make theory\ncompatible with certain key claims of the Buddha. For instance, one\nschool developed an elaborate form of four-dimensionalism, not because\nof any deep dissatisfaction with presentism, but because they believed\nthe non-existence of the past and the future to be incompatible with\nthe Buddha\u2019s alleged ability to cognize past and future events.\nAnd some modern scholars go so far as to wonder whether non-self\nfunctions as anything more than a sort of linguistic taboo against the\nuse of words like \u2018I\u2019 and \u2018self\u2019 in the\nBuddhist tradition (Collins 1982: 183). The suggestion is that just as\nin some other religious traditions the views of the founder or the\nstatements of scripture trump all other considerations, including any\nviews arrived at through the free exercise of rational inquiry, so in\nBuddhism as well there can be at best only a highly constrained arena\nfor the deployment of philosophical rationality.\n\nNow it could be that while this is true of the tradition that\ndeveloped out of the Buddha\u2019s teachings, the Buddha himself held\nthe unfettered use of rationality in quite high esteem. This would\nseem to conflict with what he is represented as saying in response to\nthe report that he arrived at his conclusions through reasoning and\nanalysis alone: that such a report is libelous, since he possesses a\nnumber of superhuman cognitive powers (M I.68). But at least some\nscholars take this passage to be not the Buddha\u2019s own words but\nan expression of later devotionalist concerns (Gombrich 2009: 164).\nIndeed one does find a spirited discussion within the tradition\nconcerning the question whether the Buddha is omniscient, a discussion\nthat may well reflect competition between Buddhism and those\nBrahmanical schools that posit an omniscient creator. And at least for\nthe most part the Buddhist tradition is careful not to attribute to\nthe Buddha the sort of omniscience usually ascribed to an all-perfect\nbeing: the actual cognition, at any one time, of all truths. Instead a\nBuddha is said to be omniscient only in the much weaker sense of\nalways having the ability to cognize any individual fact relevant to\nthe soteriological project, viz. the details of their own past lives,\nthe workings of the karmic causal laws, and whether a given\nindividual\u2019s defilements have been extirpated. Moreover, these\nabilities are said to be ones that a Buddha acquires through a\nspecific course of training, and thus ones that others may reasonably\naspire to as well. The attitude of the later tradition seems to be\nthat while one could discover the relevant facts on one\u2019s own,\nit would be more reasonable to take advantage of the fact that the\nBuddha has already done all the epistemic labor involved. When we\narrive in a new town we could always find our final destination\nthrough trial and error, but it would make more sense to ask someone\nwho already knows their way about.\n\nThe Buddhist philosophical tradition grew out of earlier efforts to\nsystematize the Buddha\u2019s teachings. Within a century or two of\nthe death of the Buddha, exegetical differences led to debates\nconcerning the Buddha\u2019s true intention on some matter, such as\nthat between the Personalists and others over the status of the\nperson. While the parties to these debates use many of the standard\ntools and techniques of philosophy, they were still circumscribed by\nthe assumption that the Buddha\u2019s views on the matter at hand are\nauthoritative. In time, however, the discussion widened to include\ninterlocutors representing various Brahmanical systems. Since the\nlatter did not take the Buddha\u2019s word as authoritative, Buddhist\nthinkers were required to defend their positions in other ways. The\nresulting debate (which continued for about nine centuries) touched on\nmost of the topics now considered standard in metaphysics,\nepistemology and philosophy of language, and was characterized by\nconsiderable sophistication in philosophical methodology. What the\nBuddha would have thought of these developments we cannot say with any\ncertainty. What we can say is that many Buddhists have believed that\nthe unfettered exercise of philosophical rationality is quite\nconsistent with his teachings.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cell-rl cellpad-med-dense vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "[<strong>A</strong>]", "<strong>Anguttara Nik\u0101ya</strong>: <em>The Book of the\nGradual Sayings</em>, trans.
