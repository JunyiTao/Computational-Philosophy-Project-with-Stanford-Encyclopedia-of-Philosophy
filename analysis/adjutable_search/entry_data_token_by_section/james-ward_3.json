    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mind\n4. Philosophy of Mind\n\n\nWard\u2019s theory of monads is a radical form of panpsychism; on\nthis view, experience is not solely ubiquitous\u2014it is all there\ntruly his. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the debate on\npanpsychism was launched by the publication in 1878 of William Kingdon\nClifford\u2019s \u2018On the Nature of Things-in-Themselves.\u2019\nThis essay was perfectly attuned to the Zeitgeist, since it\nlinked panpsychism with evolutionary theory. Clifford appeals to the\nnon-emerge argument: the transition from inert matter to conscious\nbeings would be unintelligible, a kind of unfathomable creatio ex\nnihilo; hence, we are forced to conclude that\n\u2018experience\u2019 is an intrinsic, aboriginal feature of\nmatter.\n\n\nWard apparently agrees with the general drift of this argument. In\nan essay significantly entitled \u2018Mechanism and Morals,\u2019 he\nexplains that one need not fear the theory of evolution; this does not\ndegrade either consciousness or human life, but leads to a\nspiritualized view of matter:\n\n\nIt is interesting\u2026 to notice that in the support which it\nlends to pampsychist [sic] views the theory of evolution seems\nlikely to have an effect on science the precise opposite of that which\nit exercised at first. That was a leveling down, this will be a\nleveling up. At first it appeared as if man were only to be linked with\nthe ape, now it would seem that the atom, if reality at all, may be\nlinked with man. (1927: 247)\n\n\nWard\u2019s endorsement of Clifford\u2019s evolutionary argument,\nhowever, points towards a tension in his philosophy. If evolution means\n\u2018epigenesis\u2019\u2014the coming into being of what was not\npotentially present at the beginning\u2014it is not clear why Ward\nshould be worried by the generation of mind out of matter. Conscious\nexistence might well be one of the novelties evolution is capable of\nproducing.\n\n\nWard does, at any rate, vehemently reject Clifford\u2019s specific\nversion of panpsychism. Clifford speculated that each atom of matter\nwas associated with a quantum of experience, a small piece of\n\u2018mind-stuff.\u2019 This piece of \u2018mind-stuff\u2019 was\nconceived as an atom of experience, amounting to something less than a\ncomplete thought or feeling. Clifford also held that thoughts and\nfeelings could be constituted simply by way of combination. \u201cWhen\nmolecules are so combined as to form the brain and nervous system of a\nvertebrate,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe corresponding\nelements of mind-stuff are so combined as to form some kind of\nconsciousness.\u201d Analogously, \u201cwhen matter takes the complex\nform of a living human brain, the corresponding mind-stuff takes the\nform of a human consciousness, having intelligence and volition\u201d\n(65). In this way, Clifford believed, it would be possible to explain\nwhy the genesis of complex material structures in the course of\nevolution is accompanied by the parallel emergence of higher forms of\nsentience and mental activity.\n\n\nThe theory is best regarded as a form of psycho-physical\nparallelism; this is, at all events, how Ward interprets it in\nNaturalism and Agnosticism, just before subjecting\n\u2018Clifford\u2019s wild speculations concerning mind-stuff\u2019\n(1899: Vol. 2, 12) to a devastating critique.\n\n\nWard\u2019s criticizes Clifford\u2019s theory on three main\naccounts. (1) In the first place, the whole theory presupposes a\npoint-to-point correspondence between matter and mind. Clifford\u2019s\nconception of an atom, however, is obsolete: \u2018if the speculations\nof Lord Kelvin and others are to be accepted, and the prime atom itself\nis a state of motion in a primitive homogeneous medium [the ether],\nwhat is the mental equivalent of this primordial medium?\u2019 (114)\nIn other words, Clifford\u2019s theory couples material atoms with\nsimple ideas. But if the atom is not a simple particle but a state of\nan underlying substance, it is not so easy to see what precisely in our\nconsciousness could correspond to it.\n\n\n(2) Secondly, Clifford\u2019s views\u2014\u2018a maze of\npsychological barbarism\u2019 (15)\u2014totally misrepresent the\nnature of human consciousness. It is inconceivable how there could be\nexperiences apart from subjects of experiences or larger wholes of\nconsciousness, such as the smallest pieces of mind-dust will have to\nbe: \u201cNobody bent on psychological precision would speak of ideas\nas either conscious or intelligent, but still less would he speak of\nideas existing in isolation apart from, and prior to, a consciousness\nand intelligence\u201d (15\u201316). Clifford fails to recognize the\nfundamental psychological fact of the unity of consciousness; the\npsychical field is not made up of simple sensations in the way in which\na mosaic-picture is made up of little stones.\n\n\n(3) Lastly, the mind-dust theory faces its own problem of emergence.\nWhy should the transition from inert matter to consciousness be\nregarded as more mysterious than the transition from little pieces of\nconsciousness to the single, unified consciousness of a human being?\n\u201cAllowing that it [mind-dust] is not mind, he [Clifford] makes no\nattempt to show how from such dust a living mind could ever\nspring\u201d (15). Thus, Clifford\u2019s theory has no explanatory\nadvantage over competitor accounts of the mind-body relation; there is\nstill a \u2018gap\u2019 that needs to be closed.\n\n\nOne easily sees that Ward\u2019s theory of monads does not face any\nof these difficulties. (1) The correlation between the psychical and\nthe physical is not a one-to-one correspondence between discrete\nphysical atoms and discrete psychical atoms, but is explained in terms\nof a Leibnizian theory of \u2018confused perception.\u2019 (2) There\nare no \u2018subjectless\u2019 experiences, but all experienced\ncontents are \u2018owned\u2019 by the monads, each of which is a\ngenuine unity containing distinct perceptual\ncontents\u2014Leibniz\u2019s \u2018petites\nperceptions\u2019 (1911: 256), but is not literally\n\u2018made up\u2019 by them. The relationship between the mind and\nthe monads in the body, Ward also remarks in this connection (196), is\nnot that of a whole to its parts but that of a dominant to its\nsubordinate monads. (3) And lastly, there are no mysterious transitions\nin Ward\u2019s theory. The growth of the mind\u2014from the inchoate\nexperiences of infants to the relatively sophisticated experiences of\nadult human beings\u2014shows that \u2018lower\u2019 states are\nsuperseded by \u2018higher\u2019 ones thanks to intersubjective,\nsocial intercourse.\n\n\nHence, Ward sums up his discussion by claiming the superiority of a\nLeibnizian approach over Clifford\u2019s mind-stuff theory:\n\n\nHad he [Clifford] followed Leibniz instead, he could have speculated\nas to simple minds to his heart\u2019s content, but would never have\nimagined that absurdity, \u2018a piece of mind-stuff,\u2019 to which\nhis fearless and logical interpretation of atomistic psychology had led\nhim; he would never have imagined that \u2026 mind \u2026 could be\ndescribed in terms that have a meaning only when applied to the\ncomplexity of material structure. (1899: Vol. 2, 16)\n\n\nNevertheless, Ward\u2019s theory does leave several questions open.\nIn the first place, if our conscious apprehension of the external world\nis mediated by our direct apprehension of the monads constituting the\nbody and more specifically the brain\u2014as Ward contends (1911:\n257\u2013258)\u2014why are we not aware of our neurons? Secondly,\nWard\u2019s theory escapes the composition-problem, but this is now\nreplaced by the problem of monadic interaction. How does the dominant\nmonad influence the lower ones and rule over them? Thirdly, there is a\nquestion as to the nature of space. Granted that direct monadic\ninteraction is real, where does it occur? Interaction would seem to\nrequire a common dimension or medium in order to be possible at all;\nwhat kind of dimension could host spiritual beings such as the monads\nare supposed to be?\n\n\nDisappointingly enough, on all these crucial issues Ward has nothing\nto say. In the absence of a satisfactory treatment of these topics,\nhowever, his theory becomes intrinsically unstable, as further\nreflection might show that the positions just reached will have to be\nabandoned.\n",
