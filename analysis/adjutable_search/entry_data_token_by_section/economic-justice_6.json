    "main_text": "Inequality and Poverty Measurement || Equality, Priority, Sufficiency\n2.3 Equality, Priority, Sufficiency\n\nPhilosophical interest in the measurement of inequality has recently\nrisen (Temkin 1993). Most of this philosophical literature, however,\ntends to focus on defining the right foundations for an aversion to\ninequality. In particular, Parfit (1995) proposes to give priority to\nthe worse-off not because of their relative position compared to the\nbetter-off, but because and to the extent that they are badly off.\nThis probably corresponds to defining social welfare by an additively\nseparable social welfare function, with diminishing marginal social\nutility (a social welfare function is additively separable when it is\nthe sum of separate terms, each of which depends only on one\nindividual\u2019s well-being). Interestingly, if egalitarianism is\ndefined in opposition to this \u201cpriority view\u201d by the\nfeature that it relies on judgments of relative positions, this means\nthat egalitarian values cannot be correctly represented by a separable\nsocial welfare function. This seems to raise the ethical stakes\nconcerning properties of decomposability of indices or separability of\nsocial welfare functions, which are usually considered in economics\nmerely as convenient conditions simplifying the functional forms\n(although separability may also be justified by the subsidiarity\nprinciple, according to which unconcerned individuals need not have a\nsay in a decision). The content and importance of the distinction\nbetween egalitarianism and prioritarianism remains a matter of debate\n(see, among many others, Tungodden 2003, and the contributions in\nHoltug and Lippert-Rasmussen 2007). It is also interesting to notice\nthat philosophers are often at ease to work with the notion of social\nwelfare (or social good, or inequality) as a numerical quantity with\ncardinal meaning, whereas economists typically restrict their\ninterpretation of social welfare or inequality to a purely ordinal\nranking of social states. Beside egalitarian and prioritarian\npositions one must also mention the \u201csufficiency view\u201d,\ndefended e.g. by Frankfurt (1987) who argues that priority should be\ngiven only to those below a certain threshold. One may consider that\nthis view supports the idea that poverty indices might summarize\neverything that is relevant about social welfare.\n",
