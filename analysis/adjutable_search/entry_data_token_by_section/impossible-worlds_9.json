    "main_text": "The Structure of Impossible Worlds || The Granularity Issue\n4.1 The Granularity Issue\n\nAre there any logical principles which impossible worlds must obey?\nMore precisely, is there any logical inference such that, for any\n(impossible) world \\(w\\), if the premises are all true according to\n\\(w\\), then so is the conclusion? There is at least one such\ninference: the trivial inference from \\(A\\) to \\(A\\). (For if \\(A\\) is\ntrue at world \\(w\\), then \\(A\\) is true at world \\(w\\)! An impossible\nworld may represent that it is not the case that A entails A;\nbut unless there are true contradictions, it cannot both represent and\nnot represent that A.) Are there any others? This is the\ngranularity issue.\n\nIn addressing the issue, a good starting place is the Nolan-Zalta\nPrinciple (Nolan 1997: 542; Zalta 1997: 647):\n\n(NZ)  If it is\nimpossible that \\(A\\), then there\u2019s an impossible world which\nrepresents that \\(A\\). \n\n\n(This is not an \u2018if and only if\u2019, since the converse is\nclearly false: some impossible world represents your reading this\narticle, yet that\u2019s not at all impossible. Impossible worlds\nrepresent possible and impossible situations. The things they\nrepresent make for an impossible bunch, but might each be possible\nwhen taken individually.)\n\nThe principle has some intuitive force. Nolan thinks of it as a kind\nof unrestricted \u2018comprehension principle\u2019 for\nimpossibilities. It tells something about which impossible worlds\nthere are. There will be worlds which represent that water is not\nH\\(_2\\)O, that \\(2+2=5\\), and that snow both is and is not white. One\nmight think that (NZ) entails that \u2018anything goes\u2019 with\nregard to impossible worlds: that any logical principle (except \\(A\n\\vDash A)\\) will be broken by some impossible world. If so, then (NZ)\ndelivers the open worlds mentioned above. However, to apply (NZ), we\nneed a single object-language sentence \\(A\\) which describes an\nimpossibility. Logical laws, by contrast, are stated as relationships\nbetween multiple object-language sentences. So it is not\nclear that (NZ) does its intended work.\n\nPriest (2016) adopts two principles that are similar to, but stronger\nthan, (NZ): \u2018everything holds at some worlds, and everything\nfails at some worlds\u2019 (Priest 2016, 5) and, for any distinct\n\\(A\\), \\(B\\), \u2018there are worlds where \\(A\\) holds and \\(B\\)\nfails\u2019 (Priest 2016, 7). More specifically, in our\nterminology:\n\n(4.1)  For any \\(A\\),\nthere is a world which represents that \\(A\\) and a world which does\nnot represent that \\(A\\).\n(4.2)  For any distinct\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\), there is a world which represents that \\(A\\) but does\nnot represent that \\(B\\).\n\n\nPriest calls these the \u2018primary directive\u2019 and\n\u2018secondary directive\u2019 on impossible worlds, respectively.\nThe latter implies the former, which in turn implies (NZ), but neither\nconverse holds.\n\nTo illustrate the extra power (4.2) gives us (over (4.1) and (NZ)),\nconsider Simplification, the inference from \\(A \\wedge B\\) to\n\\(A\\), or Disjunction Introduction, from \\(A\\) to \\(A \\vee\nB\\). (4.2) directly entails that there are worlds where these rules\nfail. So, if we find (4.2) plausible, we can infer that impossible\nworlds are not, in general, governed by standard\n paraconsistent logics.\n A paraconsistent logic is any one in which cont radictory\npremises \\(A\\), \\(\\neg A\\) do not entail arbitrary conclusions. But\nstandardly, paraconsistent logics maintain the principle that\nconjunctions are true just in case both conjuncts are; disjunctions\nare true just in case at least one disjunct is; and double negations\n\\(\\neg \\neg A\\) are true just in case \\(A\\) is. If we accept (4.2),\nthen these relationships will break down in some impossible\nworlds.\n\nYet even with (4.2) in play, it doesn\u2019t follow that\n\u2018anything goes\u2019 with impossible worlds. No principle so\nfar entails that some impossible world breaks the Adjunction rule,\nfrom \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) to \\(A \\wedge B\\), simply because 4.2\ndoesn\u2019t apply to inferences with multiple premises. (We discuss\nAdjunction-violating worlds further in\n section 5.2\n below.) To infer the \u2018anything goes\u2019 conclusion, that for\nany logically valid inference there is some impossible world that\nbreaks it, we\u2019ll need this principle:\n\n(NZ\\(^+\\)) If it is\nimpossible that \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) but not \\(B\\), then there\u2019s\nan impossible world which represents that \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) but not\n\\(B\\). \n\n\nHowever, we can hardly claim that we\u2019ve derived the\n\u2018anything goes\u2019 picture of impossible worlds from this\nprinciple, for it is, in effect, an explicit statement of that very\nview. Whilst the original (NZ) has a good deal of intuitive force,\nit\u2019s much harder to feel that way about (NZ\\(^+)\\).\n\nThere may be no completely general, intuitively motivated principle\n(along the lines of (NZ)) from which we can ascertain just how\nfine-grained impossible worlds should be. Nevertheless, there are\narguments which support the \u2018anything goes\u2019 picture, on\nwhich there exist open worlds (those closed under no valid inferences\nexcept \\(A \\vDash A)\\). We\u2019ll briefly consider three such\narguments.\n\nThe first is simple. If impossible worlds can break some logical rule,\nthen why can\u2019t they break all of them? Suppose we fix on\nstandard proof rules for the connectives. Each such rule is as closely\ntied to the meaning of the associated connective as the others are (to\ntheir associated connectives). Yet, as each logically impossible world\nbreaks at least one of those rules, what\u2019s to stop some other\nimpossible world from breaking any of the other rules? This argument\nhas some intuitive force, but is clearly far from conclusive.\n\nThe second argument is from epistemic states. When we consider\nreal-world finite and fallible epistemic agents, there seem to be no\nrules of the form: if someone believes \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\), then they\nmust believe (distinct) \\(B\\) (that\u2019s why the logical\nomniscience problem discussed in 2.3 is hard!). If we model their\nepistemic states in terms of worlds, then at least one of the worlds\nmust break the inference from \\(A_1, A_2,\\ldots\\) to \\(B.\\) So each\nlogical inference (except \\(A \\vDash A)\\) is broken by some world\n(Jago 2014a; Priest 2016).\n\nThe third argument is from counterpossible reasoning. Suppose, in a\nclass on alternative logics, we consider what would happen if Excluded\nMiddle \\((\\vDash A \\vee \\neg A)\\), Double-Negation Elimination \\((\\neg\n\\neg A \\vDash A)\\), or the Law of Explosion \\((A, \\neg A \\vDash B)\\)\nwere to fail. If classical logic is the one true logic, and logical\nnecessity is absolute, we\u2019re then reasoning counterpossibly. If\nwe want to analyse counterpossibles in general using impossible\nworlds, then we\u2019ll need worlds where these principles fail. But\nwe seem to be able to reason this way, non-trivially, for any kind of\nlogical principle, and so our analysis will require open worlds\n(Priest 2016).\n\nWhy have we spared \\(A \\vDash A\\) so far? Well, it seems that in order\nto break this, an impossible world would simultaneously have to\nrepresent that \\(A\\) and not represent that \\(A\\). Such a world would\nitself be an impossible object, one with inconsistent features. Since\nmost impossible worlds theorists maintain that impossible worlds\n(actually) exist and that actuality is not inconsistent, this position\nis ruled out. It is available to dialetheists and others who\nallow reality to have inconsistent features. There seems to be no\ntheoretical cost in requiring \\(A \\vDash A\\) to hold at all worlds\n(impossible or otherwise). Going back to epistemic states, for\nexample, we want to represent inconsistent beliefs, such as\nsomeone\u2019s believing both that \\(A\\) and that \\(\\neg A\\) at the\nsame time; but it would be a mistake to infer that she both believes\nand does not believe that \\(A\\).\n",
