Regress Arguments for Foundationalism\n\nA foundationally justified belief (henceforth simply:\n\u2018foundational belief\u2019) is one that does not depend on any\nother beliefs for its justification. According to foundationalism, any\njustified belief must either be foundational or depend for its\njustification, ultimately, on foundational beliefs. Historically,\nfoundationalism was very widely, almost universally accepted.\nAristotle argued that \u201cnot all knowledge is demonstrative\u201d\n(i.e., not all knowledge is based on an argument from other things\nknown), and that some knowledge must be \u201cindependent of\ndemonstration\u201d (Posterior Analytics, I.3). Many of the\nmedieval philosophers seemed in agreement with Aristotle, holding that\nall knowledge must rest on \u201cfirst principles\u201d or\n\u201cself-evident truths\u201d of some sort. More recently,\nDescartes famously held that all knowledge must rest on a secure\nfoundation of indubitable truths (see the entry on\n Descartes\u2019s epistemology).\n Many other philosophers of the early modern period, including Locke,\nLeibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Reid, all seemed to accept\nfoundationalism as well, despite disagreeing about much else. When an\nargument was implicitly or explicitly offered for the view, it was\nmost often some version of the now famous epistemic regress argument.\n(See Aristotle\u2019s Posterior Analytics, I.3, for an early\nversion of this argument.) Before presenting the argument we should\ndiscuss a principle it depends on.\n\nSuppose I claim to be justified in believing that Fred will die\nshortly and offer as my evidence that Fred has an untreatable and\nserious form of cancer. Concerned, you ask me how I discovered that\nFred has cancer, and I respond that it is just a hunch on my part. As\nsoon as you become convinced (perhaps after further questioning) that\nI have no good reason to suppose that Fred has cancer, you will\nimmediately conclude that my suspicion about Fred\u2019s condition\ngives me no justification for believing that Fred will soon die.\nGeneralizing, one might suggest the following principle:\n\nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust be justified in believing E.\n\nNow consider another example. Suppose I claim to be justified in\nbelieving that Fred will die shortly and offer as my justification\nthat a certain line across his palm (his infamous\n\u201clifeline\u201d) is short. Rightly skeptical, you wonder this\ntime what reason I have for believing that palm lines have anything\nwhatsoever to do with length of life. As soon as you become satisfied\nthat I have no justification for supposing that there is any kind of\nprobabilistic connection between the character of this line and\nFred\u2019s life, you will again reject my claim to have a justified\nbelief about Fred\u2019s impending demise. That suggests that we\nmight expand our principle to include a second clause.\n\nPrinciple of Inferential Justification (PIJ):\n\nTo be justified in believing P on the basis of E one\nmust be (1) justified in believing E, and (2) justified in\nbelieving that E makes probable P.\n\nOne might note that in the palm reading example there actually is no\nsignificant, objective probability between the length of Fred\u2019s\nso-called \u201clife-line\u201d and his life span. Perhaps this is\nwhy my belief that he is going to die soon is unjustified, and not\nthat I don\u2019t satisfy clause (2). Against this, the proponent of\nPIJ might ask us to consider an amendment to the case. Suppose that,\nsurprisingly, it turns out that there is some objective,\nsignificant probabilistic connection between \u201clife-lines\u201d\nand the life spans of the individuals who have them, though again,\nsuppose that I do not have any justification for believing that there\nis such a connection. This possibility seems coherent: the fact that\nthe relevant objective probabilistic relation obtains is not\nsufficient for one to have justification for believing that it\nobtains. But then, intuitively, I remain unjustified in believing that\nFred is going to die soon. Or consider the possibility that I believe\nFred will die because he has just ingested a lot of hemlock, and when\nyou ask me why I think hemlock would lead to death, I say that\nI\u2019m not sure, that it is just a hunch on my part that it is\ngoing to kill him. Again, if I lack justification for believing that\nhemlock is a deadly poison, or that it is likely to have this effect,\nthen intuitively, I lack justification for believing that Fred will\ndie soon. What more, then, is needed? A natural though controversial\nsuggestion is that one must satisfy something like clause (2).[3]\n\nWith the first clause of PIJ, one can present a relatively\nstraightforward epistemic regress argument for foundationalism. That\nclause basically says that one cannot acquire justification for a\nbelief by inferring it from an unjustified belief. It also seems that\none cannot acquire justification for a belief by way of a circular,\ninferential justification\u2014one cannot rely even in part on a\nproposition as a premise in an inference in support of that very\nproposition. We seem left with two options: allow that some beliefs\nhave justification without depending on other beliefs, or suppose that\nall justification is inferential. If all justification is inferential,\nthen for someone S to be justified in believing some\nproposition P, S must be in a position to\nlegitimately infer it from some other proposition E1. But\nE1 could justify S in believing P only if\nS were justified in believing E1, and if all\njustification were inferential, S would have to infer it (or\nat least be able to infer it) from some other proposition justifiably\nbelieved, E2, a proposition which in turn would have to be\ninferred from some other proposition justifiably believed,\nE3, and so on, ad infinitum. But finite beings\ncannot complete an infinitely long chain of reasoning. And so, if all\njustification were inferential, no one could be justified in believing\nanything at all to any extent whatsoever.\n\nThis, however, is not yet an argument for foundationalism as much as\nan argument against what we might call\n\u201cinferentialism\u201d\u2014the view that all justification is\ninferential\u2014for it leaves open the skeptical position that we\nare not, and could not be, justified in believing anything at all,\nwhether by inference or otherwise. This most radical of all\nskepticisms seems absurd (it entails that one couldn\u2019t even be\njustified in believing it). But, strictly speaking, none of this shows\nthat we have non-inferential justification for any of our beliefs, or\neven that non-inferential justification is possible. At best, it shows\nonly that, if justification is possible, or if we\nare or could be justified in believing anything at all, then\nthat justification must take a foundationalist structure. The\nepistemic regress argument for foundationalism thus needs an\nadditional premise, though one that all but the most radical skeptics\nwould accept: that epistemic justification is in principle possible\nfor beings like us.\n\nIf we accept the more controversial second clause of PIJ, the looming\nregresses proliferate. Not only must S above be justified in\nbelieving E1, S must also be justified in believing\nthat E1 makes likely P, a proposition he would have\nto infer (if there are no foundations) from some other proposition\nF1, which he would have to infer from F2, which he\nwould have to infer from F3, and so on ad infinitum.\nBut S would also need to be justified in believing that\nF1 does in fact make likely that E1 makes likely\nP, a proposition he would need to infer from some other\nproposition G1, which he would need to infer from some other\nproposition G2, and so on. And he would need to infer that\nG1 does indeed make likely that F1 makes likely that\nE1 makes likely P, and so on. Without\nnoninferentially justified beliefs, it would seem that we would need\nto complete an infinite number of infinitely long chains of reasoning\nin order to be justified in believing anything!\n\nPIJ is controversial, especially its second clause. It is important to\nnote that either clause of the principle can be used by itself to\ngenerate the allegedly vicious regress for the philosopher who rejects\nfoundations. It is the two clauses combined that are supposed to\npresent the anti-foundationalist with an infinite number of vicious\nregresses. A number of philosophers (among them foundationalists)\nwould argue that the second clause of PIJ confuses levels of epistemic\nquestions. It is far too strong to require someone to have a justified\nbelief in a probabilistic connection between available evidence and\nthe conclusion reached on the basis of that evidence. Such a\nrequirement is at best plausible for having second-level\njustification, justification for the epistemic belief that one has an\ninferentially justified belief. In responding to a challenge presented\nto one\u2019s having an inferentially justified belief in P\non the basis of E, one might find oneself searching for\njustification to support the claim that E makes probable\nP, but that is only because in the context of the challenge\none is trying to support or justify the claim that one has a justified\nbelief. A similar claim might be made with respect to clause (1) of\nthe principle, although it is more difficult to generate the\nsupporting intuition.\n\nIn any event, the careful foundationalist is certainly not\nconfused about level-distinctions. The foundationalist who\nsupports PIJ is claiming that a necessary condition for\nsomeone\u2019s having an inferentially justified belief in P\nbased on E is that the person have both a justified belief in\nE and a justified belief in the proposition that E\nmakes P probable. It is simply not enough that E is\ntrue or that E does in fact make probable P. Our\noriginal examples used to support PIJ would seem to reinforce that\nconclusion. Even if there happened to be some bizarre connection\nbetween palm lines and length of life, for example, the person who has\nno reason to believe that such a connection exists has no\njustification for conclusions reached about length of life based on\nthis anatomical feature of people. Similarly, even though there is in\nfact a connection between ingesting hemlock and dying, a person who\nhad no reason to believe that ingesting hemlock would bring about\ndeath has no justification for believing that someone (who has just\ningested hemlock) is about to die. Some have attempted to defend a\nweaker version of the principle, one that replaces the second clause\nof PIJ with the condition that the subject have some sort of\nnon-doxastic awareness or appreciation of the connection--e.g., that\none be acquainted with the connection or that it appear to one that\nthe connection holds (e.g., Tucker 2012). \n\nThere are responses to the charge of vicious regress facing\nanti-foundationalists. One is to deny the premise that circular\ninferences are vicious or no good: granted, one can\u2019t\neffectively convince someone who is skeptical of the truth of\nP that it is true by relying on an inference that ultimately\ncomes back to P, but perhaps circular inferences can provide\njustification despite being dialectically ineffective (i.e.,\nineffective in persuading others). Still, it seems odd to say that one\ncould justify P by use of an inference from P .\nAfter all, if P is already justified, the subject does not\nneed to use it to justify P; and if it is not justified then,\nin line with the first clause of PIJ, one could not use it to justify\nP. More plausibly, the anti-foundationalist might reject the\npresupposition that all justification is linear or one-directional,\nthat it flows from one belief to another, or is inherited by a belief\nfrom others. According to coherentism about epistemic justification,\nbeliefs are justified \u201cholistically\u201d rather than in a\nlinear, piecemeal way. Each belief is justified by virtue of its\ncoherence with the rest of what one believes\u2014in other words, by\nvirtue of belonging to a coherent set or web of beliefs. The\ncoherentist avoids the appearance of vicious circularity by insisting\nthat one needn\u2019t first have justification for believing\nthe other propositions in one\u2019s belief system. The coherence\ntheorist\u2019s response to the argument for foundationalism is, of\ncourse, only as plausible as the coherence theory of justification\n(see\n coherentist theories of epistemic justification).\n\nSome forms of coherentism might complicate our taxonomy. According to\nsome coherentists, a belief can depend for its justification on how\nwell it \u201ccoheres\u201d with the rest of one\u2019s beliefs,\nand if this coherence is not understood in terms of\nactual or available inference, then they would allow for dependent but\nnon-inferentially justified belief. Some beliefs may count as\nfoundational in the sense of not depending on inference from other\nbeliefs for justification, while still depending on other beliefs.\n\n\nOne other response is to embrace infinitism and hold that an infinite\nregress is not necessarily vicious or problematic. Infinitism has a\nfew defenders (e.g., Peter Klein (1998) and more recently, Fantl\n(2003) and Aikin (2011)). The infinitist accepts the need to be\nable to supply non-circular justification for believing what\nwe do, but argues that given the complexity of the human mind and its\ncapacity to entertain and justifiably believe an infinite number of\npropositions, there is nothing vicious about the relevant regresses we\nface. There is no reason to suppose that we would be unable to justify\nevery proposition we believe by appeal to some other different\nproposition which we justifiably believe. Infinitism is a view that\nshould be seriously considered, particularly once one realizes that\none not only can but arguably does have an infinite number of\njustified beliefs (e.g., that 2 is greater than 1, that 3 is greater\nthat 1, and so on.). For some further discussion of infinitism and\nchallenges to it, see Klein and Turri (2014).\n\nSome don\u2019t find the regress argument to be the best argument for\nthe existence of foundational justification; as with any argument by\nelimination, it depends on whether the alternatives eliminated really\nare untenable. Pryor (2013b), for example, claims that the best\nargument comes from considering examples. I believe that I feel tired,\nthat I have a headache, that I intend to get a glass of water, that\nblack is not white; and in each case, it doesn\u2019t seem that my\njustification is mediated by any other proposition. This supports the\nclaim that there are foundational beliefs, though it does not speak\ndirectly to the thesis that all other beliefs must depend, ultimately,\non foundational beliefs for their justification. \n",
