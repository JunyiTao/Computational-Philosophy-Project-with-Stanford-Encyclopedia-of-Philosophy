The ubiquitous nature of NHST\nin life and behavioural sciences is well documented, most recently by\nCristea and Ioannidis (2018). This is important pre-condition for\nestablishing its role as a cause, since it could not be a cause if its\nactual use was rare. The dichotomous nature of NHST facilitates\npublication bias (Meehl 1967, 1978). For example, the language of\naccept and reject in hypothesis testing maps conveniently on to\nacceptance and rejection of manuscripts, a fact that led Rosnow and\nRosenthal (1989) to decry that \u201csurely God loves the .06 nearly\nas much as the .05\u201d (1989: 1277). Techniques that failed to\nenshrine a dichotomous threshold would be harder to employ in service\nof publication bias. For example, a case has been made that estimation\nusing effect sizes and confidence intervals (introduced above) would\nbe less prone to being used in service of publication bias (Cumming\n2012, Cumming and Calin-Jageman 2017.\n\nAs already mentioned, the average statistical power in various\ndisciplines is low. Not only is power often low, but it is virtually\nnever reported; less than 10% of published studies in psychology\nreport statistical power and even fewer in ecology do (Fidler et al.\n2006). Explanations for the widespread neglect of statistical power\noften highlight the many common misconceptions and fallacies\nassociated with p values (e.g., Haller & Krauss 2002;\nGigerenzer 2018). For example, the inverse probability\n fallacy[1]\n has been used to explain why so many researchers fail to calculate\nand report statistical power (Oakes 1986).\n\nIn 2017, a group of 72 authors proposed in a Nature Human\nBehaviour paper that alpha level in statistical significance\ntesting be lowered to 0.005 (as opposed to the current standard of\n0.05) to improve the reproducibility rate of published research\n(Benjamin et al. 2018). A reply from a different set of 88 authors was\npublished in the same journal, arguing against this proposal and\nstating instead that researchers should justify their alpha level\nbased on context (Lakens et al. 2018). Several other replies have\nfollowed, including a call from Andrew Gelman and colleagues to\nabandon statistical significance altogether (McShane et al. 2018, \nOther Internet Resources). The\nexchange has become known on social media as the Alpha Wars\n(e.g., in the Barely Significant blog,\n Other Internet Resources)).\n Independently, the American Statistical Association released a\nstatement on the use of p values for the first time in its\nhistory, cautioning against their overinterpretation and pointing out\nthe limits of the information they offer about replication (Wasserman\n& Lazar 2016) and devoted their association\u2019s 2017 annual\nconvention to the theme \u201cScientific Method for the\n21st Century: A World Beyond \\(p <0.05\\)\u201d (see\n Other Internet Resources).\n \n",
