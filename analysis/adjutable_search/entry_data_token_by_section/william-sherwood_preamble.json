    "main_text": "\n\nWilliam of Sherwood (Guilelmus, Willelmus, Schyrwode, Shirwode,\nShyreswode, and others) was a 13th century English logician who taught\nat the University of Paris and who worked in the Realist tradition of\nlogic. His Introduction to Logic, written in the middle of the\ncentury, was one of the four most influential textbooks on logics in\nthe 13th century, along with Lambert of Auxerre\u2019s Summary,\nRoger Bacon\u2019s Art and Science of Logic, and Peter of Spain\u2019s\nSummaries of Logic. Roger Bacon in his Opus tertium\n(1267) singles Sherwood out for high praise, describing him as\n\u201cmuch wiser than Albert [the Great]; for in philosophia\ncommunis no one is greater than he\u201d (Kretzmann 1966, pp.\n5\u20136; Kretzmann 1968, pp. 3\u20134).\n",
