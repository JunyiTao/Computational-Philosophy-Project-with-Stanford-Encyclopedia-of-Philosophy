    "main_text": "Quantum Mechanics as a Probability Calculus || The \u201cLogic\u201d of Projections\n1.2 The \u201cLogic\u201d of Projections\n\nAs stressed by von Neumann, the \\(\\{0,1\\}\\)-valued observables may be\nregarded as encoding propositions about\u2014or, to use his phrasing,\nproperties of\u2014the state of the system. It is not difficult to\nshow that a self-adjoint operator \\(P\\) with spectrum contained in the\ntwo-point set \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) must be a projection; i.e., \\(P^2 = P\\).\nSuch operators are in one-to-one correspondence with the closed\nsubspaces of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). Indeed, if \\(P\\) is a projection, its\nrange is closed, and any closed subspace is the range of a unique\nprojection. If \\(u\\) is any unit vector, then \\(\\langle Pu,u\\rangle =\n\\llvert Pu\\rrvert ^2\\) is the expected value of the corresponding\nobservable in the state represented by \\(u\\). Since this observable is\n\\(\\{0,1\\}\\)-valued, we can interpret this expected value as the\nprobability that a measurement of the observable will produce\nthe \u201caffirmative\u201d answer 1. In particular, the affirmative\nanswer will have probability 1 if and only if Pu = u; that\nis, \\(u\\) lies in the range of \\(P\\). Von Neumann concludes that \n\n\n\u2026 the relation between the properties of a physical system on\nthe one hand, and the projections on the other, makes possible a sort\nof logical calculus with these. However, in contrast to the concepts\nof ordinary logic, this system is extended by the concept of\n\u201csimultaneous decidability\u201d which is characteristic for\nquantum mechanics. (1932: 253) \n\n\nLet\u2019s examine this \u201clogical calculus\u201d of\nprojections. Ordered by set-inclusion, the closed subspaces of\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\) form a complete lattice, in which the meet (greatest\nlower bound) of a set of subspaces is their intersection, while their\njoin (least upper bound) is the closed span of their union. Since a\ntypical closed subspace has infinitely many complementary closed\nsubspaces, this lattice is not distributive; however, it is\northocomplemented by the mapping \n\n\\[\\mathbf{M} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{M}^{\\bot} = \\{v\\in \\mathbf{H} \\mid\n\\forall u\\in \\mathbf{M}(\\langle v,u\\rangle = 0)\\}.\\]\n\n\n In view of the\nabove-mentioned one-one correspondence between closed subspaces and\nprojections, we may impose upon the set \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) the\nstructure of a complete orthocomplemented lattice, defining \\(P\\le\nQ\\), where \\(\\rran (P) \\subseteq \\rran (Q)\\) and \\(P' = 1 - P\\) (so\nthat \\(\\rran (P') = \\rran (P)^{\\bot})\\). It is straightforward that\n\\(P\\le Q\\) just in case \\(PQ = QP = P\\). More generally, if PQ =\nQP, then \\(PQ = P\\wedge Q\\), the meet of \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) in\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\); also in this case their join is given by \\(P\\vee Q\n= P+Q - PQ\\).\n\n\n1.1 Lemma:\n\nLet \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) be projection operators on the Hilbert space\n\\(\\mathbf{H}\\). The following are equivalent:\n\n\\(PQ = QP\\)\nThe sublattice of \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) generated by \\(P, Q, P'\\) and\n\\(Q'\\) is Boolean\n\\(P, Q\\) lie in a common Boolean sub-ortholattice of\n\\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\).\n\n\n\nAdhering to the idea that commuting observables\u2014in particular,\nprojections\u2014are simultaneously measurable, we conclude that the\nmembers of a Boolean sub-ortholattice of \\(L(\\mathbf{H})\\) are\nsimultaneously testable. This suggests that we can maintain a\nclassical logical interpretation of the meet, join and orthocomplement\nas applied to commuting projections.\n",
