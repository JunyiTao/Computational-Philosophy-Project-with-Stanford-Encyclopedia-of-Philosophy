(Our weight is an example.) The former\nare the intrinsic properties, the latter are the extrinsic properties.\nThis seems to be an intuitive enough distinction to grasp, and hence\nthe intuitive distinction has made its way into many discussions in\nphilosophy, including discussions in ethics, philosophy of mind,\nmetaphysics, epistemology and philosophy of physics. Unfortunately,\nwhen we look more closely at the intuitive distinction, we find reason\nto suspect that it conflates a few related distinctions, and that each\nof these distinctions is somewhat resistant to analysis.\n",
