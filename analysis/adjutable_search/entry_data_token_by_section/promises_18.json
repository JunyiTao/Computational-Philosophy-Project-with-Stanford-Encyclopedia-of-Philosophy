In promissory theory proper, there has been some focus on\nthese with the end of informing a comprehensive promissory theory, one\nthat might go some distance to explain these related phenomena.\n5.3.1 Vows\n\nWork on vows has occurred in different contexts, and between different\nvoices, within and outside of philosophy. Wedding vows and religious\nvows in particular have been the object of some recent work.\n\nKyle Fruh (2019) surveys the difficulties some promissory theories,\nand in particular expectational theories have in accommodating these\nnotions, and offers that any reasonably successful theory of promises\nwould likely have to explain these phenomena as well. He calls this\nthe \u201cbreadth\u201d requirement:\n\n\nOaths and vows partially fill out what I call the \u201cbreadth\ncriterion\u201d: Theories of promising should cover not only\ncustomary, interpersonal promises but also sibling phenomena,\nincluding oaths and vows. Promises, oaths, and vows are all forms of\nvoluntary binding commitments; indeed, the terms are often used\ninterchangeably. They should be taken up into theory together. The\nfamiliar and powerful grounds for this intuitive idea are at least\ntwofold: It is more parsimonious to have a single theory that covers\nthe entire family rather than developing distinct theories for each of\nthe phenomena, and if there is such a theory, its explanatory power\nwill compare favorably to theories that fail to cover some of the\nphenomena in question. A theory of promising that is silent about\noaths and vows is one we have less reason to accept than one that can\nilluminate the capacity of oaths and vows to produce moral\nobligations. Provisionally at least, the breadth criterion should be\napplied to competing theories of promising. (Fruh 2019: 859)\n\n\nOn vows per se, in addition to Fruh\u2019s work, novel\ntheories of the obligation of vows have been advanced by Alida\nLiberman (2019), who makes vows out to be a species of resolution.\n\nIn another vein, Elizabeth Brake, in her widely read 2011 piece\n\u201cIs Divorce Promise Breaking\u201d argues that wedding vows\ncan\u2019t be construed as promises, on pain of saying that divorce\nis promise breaking. Brake argues for this and other reasons, wedding\nvows shouldn\u2019t be taken as promises at all.\n\nBrake\u2019s work has in turn spurred further dialogue on wedding\nvows as promises, see Gheaus (2017), Cowley (2020), and Liberman\n(2021).\n5.3.2 Oaths\n\nLike promises, oaths play a part in many different human undertakings.\nIn politics, at least among democracies, oaths of office for those in\npositions of power are the norm. In the professions oaths like the\nHippocratic oath sworn by doctors, are also very common. In cases of\ntestimony in court, testimonial oaths are standard, and witnesses are\nasked to swear oaths of veracity for their affidavits or other\ntestimony.\n\nTraditionally oaths were understood as a separate species of\nobligation-producing commitment, a \u201ccalling to witness\u201d of\nGod to bolster a claim to veracity on the part of the swearer.\nAquinas, for example divides them into four types: Calls to witness\ntruths of the past or present, which he calls declaratory oaths, and\nclaims of some future conduct, which are promissory oaths. Further,\noaths can be either simple invitations to witnessings, which are\nsimply oaths, or they can be invitations to punish the swearer for\ndefault, which are curses:\n\n\n[O]aths are taken for the purpose of confirmation. Now speculative\npropositions receive confirmation from reason, which proceeds from\nprinciples known naturally and infallibly true. But particular\ncontingent facts regarding man cannot be confirmed by a necessary\nreason, wherefore propositions regarding such things are wont to be\nconfirmed by witnesses. Now a human witness does not suffice to\nconfirm such matters for two reasons. First, on account of man\u2019s\nlack of truth, for many give way to lying, according to Ps. 16:10,\n\u201cTheir mouth hath spoken lies [Vulg.:\n\u2018proudly\u2019]\u201d. Secondly, on account of [his] lack of\nknowledge, since he can know neither the future, nor secret thoughts,\nnor distant things: and yet men speak about such things, and our\neveryday life requires that we should have some certitude about them.\nHence the need to have recourse to a Divine witness, for neither can\nGod lie, nor is anything hidden from Him. Now to call God to witness\nis named jurare (to swear) because it is established as\nthough it were a principle of law (jure) that what a man\nasserts under the invocation of God as His witness should be accepted\nas true. Now sometimes God is called to witness when we assert present\nor past events, and this is termed a \u201cdeclaratory oath\u201d;\nwhile sometimes God is called to witness in confirmation of something\nfuture, and this is termed a \u201cpromissory oath\u201d. But oaths\nare not employed in order to substantiate necessary matters, and such\nas come under the investigation of reason; for it would seem absurd in\na scientific discussion to wish to prove one\u2019s point by an oath.\n(Summa II-II q.89-Art. i)\n\nA person is called to give witness, in order that he may make known\nthe truth about what is alleged. Now there are two ways in which God\nmakes known whether the alleged facts are true or not. In one way He\nreveals the truth simply, either by inward inspiration, or by\nunveiling the facts, namely, by making public what was hitherto\nsecret: in another way by punishing the lying witness, and then He is\nat once judge and witness, since by punishing the liar He makes known\nhis lie. Hence oaths are of two kinds: one is a simple contestation of\nGod, as when a man says \u201cGod is my witness\u201d, or, \u201cI\nspeak before God\u201d, or, \u201cBy God\u201d, which has the same\nmeaning, as Augustine states [*See argument On the contrary]; the\nother is by cursing, and consists in a man binding himself or\nsomething of his to punishment if what is alleged be not true.\n(ibid., Reply Obj. 3)\n\n\nSo oaths are ways of bolstering one\u2019s claim to veracity by\ncalling on God to witness your claim. If your claim is about your\nfuture conduct, then the oath can be understood as a promise, with God\nas the promisee. You can invite god to witness alone, on the tacit\nunderstanding that he sees and knows all and will take account, or you\ncan invite him to punish you for falsity directly, e.g \u201cMay God\nstrike me down\u201d or \u201cGod blind me\u201d\n(\u201cblimey\u201d).\n\nRecent philosophical work has tended to recapitulate this analysis,\nabsent the divine promisee. This broadens the appeal, certainly, but\nit means a substantial change in the nature of the grounding of the\nobligation.\n\nThomas Scanlon, in his influential 1990 piece \u201cPromises and\nPractices\u201d, is an example of this. Scanlon offers roughly the\nsame meaning of the term, and rehearses the Thomistic distinctions\nbetween testamentary and promissory oaths, but he makes oaths out to\nbe not invitations to witness or punish, but rather invocations of\nimportant or sacred objects or ideas:\n\n\nIn an oath a person says, in support of a claim to be telling the\ntruth or to have a sincere and reliable intention to do a certain\nthing, \u201cI swear to you by \u2026\u201d, naming here something\nto which he or she is assumed to attach great value, such as God, the\nBible, or the memory of a loved one. It is not necessary that the\nvalue appealed to involve a code of honor or convention of\ntruth-telling. What is claimed is simply that the speaker\u2019s\nsincerity in making the present claim is comparable to the sincerity\nof his or her devotion to the value named. It would cheapen such a\nvalue, and hence be incompatible with true devotion to it, to invoke\nit for personal advantage in support of an insincere claim. Of course,\nsome think that it is incompatible with holding something sacred to\ninvoke it in sup port of any claim, which is why some religions forbid\nthe use of holy texts or the name of God in this way. (Scanlon 1990:\n223)\n\n\nThis move allows the analysis to survive the removal of God as a\npromisee, but subtly substitutes the receiver of the vow (\u201cI\nswear to you\u2026\u201d) in its place.\n\nFruh (2019) resists this move, and disputes the understanding of oaths\nas \u201cdirected\u201d toward a counterparty. He argues at some\nlength against the plausibility of various candidate counterparties\n(promisees) for standard oaths. Rather, for Fruh oaths should be\nunderstood as a sui generis form of voluntary obligation,\ndifferent from promises and vows in that it is without a\n\u201ccounterparty\u201d. Liberman (2021) instead argues that oath\nand vows should be understood as \u201cexceptionless\nresolutions\u201d, both without counterparty, and both different than\ntraditional promise.\n5.4 Promissory Reasons\n\nAnother set of issues that have been discussed in the literature we\nmight call issues of promissory psychology. These are issues\nconcerning the mental states of promisors and promisees, and the role\nthese play in producing, explaining or justifying promissory\nobligations. The main focus is on promissory reasons.\n\nWhat reasons do promisors have to keep promises? How do these\npromissory come about and how do they function? How strong are they,\nand what, if any, reasons may override them? These are just some of\nthe most common questions in this area, and the literature on them is\nquite large, too large to adequately survey here, so I will just note\nsome important foci. Of particular interest are the answers to these\nquestions provided by Joseph Raz (1975, 1982, 1986, 2012).\n\nRaz proposes a system of practical rationality with two sorts of\nreasons, of first and second order. First order reasons are reason for\nor against courses of action, while second order reasons are reasons\nabout reasons themselves. Exclusionary reasons are second order\nreasons that exclude other, first order reasons. Promises, says Raz,\nproduce (in the promisor) both first order reasons to perform the\npromised act as well as second order exclusionary reasons to bar from\nconsiderations most first order reasons that counsel against keeping\nthe promise.\n\n\nLet us say that a person does A for the reason that\np if and only if he does A because he believes that\np is a reason for him to do A. A person refrains\nfrom doing A for the reason that p if and only if it\nis not the case that he does A for the reason that\np. In other words a person refrains from acting for a reason\nif he does not do the act or does it but not for this reason.\n\u201cRefrains\u201d is used here in an extended sense which does\nnot imply that the agent intentionally avoids acting for the reason. A\nsecond order reason is any reason to act for a reason or to refrain\nfrom acting for a reason. An exclusionary reason is a second order\nreason to refrain from acting for some reason. (Raz 1975: 487)\n\n\nMoreover, on the Razian picture exclusionary reasons are\n\u201ccontent independent\u201d reasons. This is the notion\n(original with Hart [1958, 1982] cited in Sciaraffa 2009) that a\nreason for action is independent of the \u201ccontent\u201d or\n\u201cnature\u201d of the action they implicate:\n\nThere is a vibrant literature, spanning many decades, engaging with\nRaz\u2019s intriguing suggestions. see Sciaraffa (2009) for a survey\nof some of the earlier literature on this. More recent work can be\nfound in McBride (2015), MacMahon (2018), Molina (2019), Murphy\n(2020), Kimel (forthcoming), and others. Much of this work is in legal\ntheory, on the philosophical underpinnings of private law.\n6. Promises and Other Fields\n\nIn addition to the various positive theories of promising, there are\nalso several other issues of philosophical interest concerning the\nintersection of promissory theory and other fields or theoretical\nframeworks. In the following sections I try and outline some of these,\nand provide some guides to the literature.\n6.1 Promises and Speech Acts\n\nPromises have often been cast as speech acts, or actions that we\nperform by speaking. The locus classicus for this issue is J.\nL. Austin\u2019s 1962 book How to Do Things with Words. In\nit Austin defines two sorts of speech acts, or\n\u201cperformatives\u201d: illocutions and perlocutions. Illocutions\nare those actions that we perform by uttering the words alone. Austin\nlists requesting, warning and announcing as examples. Alternatively,\nperlocutions are actions performed by speaking which require some\nparticular effect of the speech in order to be successful.\nAustin cites persuading, explaining and alarming as examples of the\nlatter sort of locution.\n\nAustin takes promising to be an illocutionary act, that is, he takes\nit that promising is merely a matter of a certain form of\nutterance, under certain conditions. Moreover the reason he takes this\nto be is that he thinks that promising is a conventional act,\none that invokes a certain practice to formalize the action. Austin\nthinks that in this way promises are just of a piece with many sorts\nof obligation-producing actions, such as betting, buying and\ncontracting (Austin 1962 [1975: 19])\n\nAustin\u2019s linguistic distinction mirrors the crucial difference\nbetween the expectational and conventional theories of promising. On\nthe conventionalist view that Austin adopts, promises are\n\u201cconventional\u201d moves in the game, and as such one promises\nby \u201cmaking the right moves\u201d, i.e., saying the right sorts\nof things and otherwise obeying the rules of the game.\n\nSearle, taking up the speech-act framework pioneered by J. L.\nAustin\u2014similarly makes promises out to be a particular form of\nspeech act\u2014(see Searle 1963, 1965, 1965, 1979) a non-verbal\naction affected by speech, of a piece with \u201cordering\u201d and\n\u201cagreeing\u201d. Searle, like Austin, is a paradigmatic\nconventionalist his work has been widely influential, and has helped\nto grow the literature on both promises and speech act theory (cf.\nSearle et al. 1980, inter alia)\n\nThe investigation of promises as speech acts is furthered in the work\nof Rawls (1955), William Alston (1964, 1994), John Searle (1963, 1965,\n1979, 1980, 1985), David Jones (1966), Otto Hanfling (1975), and\nMichael Pratt (2003, 2007), Christina Corredor (2001), and Vincent\nBlok (2013) among others. See Harris and McKinney (2021) for a\ncontemporary survey\n6.2 Promise, Contracts and the Law\n\nThe relationship between the law, contracts and promises is a long and\ntangled one. From its ancient origins promissory theory has been\nintertwined with issues of contracts and agreements more generally.\nAnd since at least the time of Aquinas and especially with the works\nof the later Natural Lawyers like Grotius and Pufendorf, scholarly\nwork on promising has been done at least in part with an eye towards\ninforming the law of contract. This in turn gave rise to a tradition\non the part of legal theorists of surveying such scholarship in their\nwork on both historical and contemporary issues in the law of\ncontract. Finally, the law itself has methods for dealing with\npromises (as they are obviously the sorts of things that might lead to\nlegal wrangling). Thus the legal practice regarding promises has some\ninterest to theorists of promising as well. The result is two\ninterlinked scholarly traditions and bodies of work.\n\nPerhaps the first question on the mind of legal and philosophical\nhistorians is the issue of the degree to which, if any, contractual\nobligations are grounded in promissory obligations in contemporary\nlegal regimes. This question is complicated by the different\ntraditions and cultures involved in the long path to contemporary law,\ni.e., natural law theory, virtue theory, rights theory, the (anglo)\ncommon law, the continental civilian law, canon law and other\ntheoretical approaches, which are in turn variously situated in the\nUK, on the European continent, and in the anglo territories (Scotland,\nAustralia, Canada the US, etc.). The answer to the question is\ndifferent in different traditions and places, and the contemporary law\nis the result of some complicated amalgamation of these different\ntraditions over time. For an overview of these issues, see, e.g.,\nGordley (1991), Ibbetson (1999), Markovits (2011), Swain (2013), or\nFried (1981, 2015).\n\nOne central dialectic within this corpus has the \u201cnormative\npower\u201d tradition of the natural lawyers pitted against the more\nexpectational views of the English common law. As Atiyah notes (1981:\nch. 6), there is a tension between the Natural Law promissory theory\nand the actual law of contract and promise plainly evident in the\nBritish common law. One source of the tension is the common law\ndoctrine of \u201cconsideration\u201d, which mandates that only\npromises given with \u201cconsideration\u201d, i.e., given in\nexchange for something of value, are enforceable in the law. In other\nwords, mere promises, given without consideration, are traditionally\nnot indemnified by the law.\n\nFurther, as Lon Fuller and William Perdue pointed out in an\ninfluential 1936/37 article \u201cThe Reliance Interest in Contract\nDamages\u201d, the damages awarded by courts to those who have had a\npromise or contract broken is best understood as being proportional to\nthe harm the plaintiff suffered in relying on the promise. These and\nother considerations argue for a theory of promises based on\nexpectations and reliance, i.e., an expectational theory, as opposed\nto one based on conventions or natural duties, and this is what a\nnumber of philosophers and legal theorists have done. This debate has\nspawned a sizable literature (see Swain 2013 for a good overview of\nthis work).\n\nCharles Fried\u2019s widely influential book Contract as\nPromise (1981) re-kindled this debate in American legal circles.\nFried argued that the traditional approach, which made contractual\nobligation out to be grounded in promissory obligation, was slowly\nbeing usurped by the consequentialist-flavored approaches of the\nEnglish common law, and he aimed his book as a polemic against this\nmovement.\n\nFried took on these arguments directly, and the corpus of work that\nsprang from the book greatly enlarged the debate. In 2012 a special\nconference and subsequent issue of the Suffolk University Law Review\nrevisited Fried\u2019s work, 30 years on. This new corpus of work\nprovides us with some interesting new explorations. As an example of\nthis, see Brian Bix\u2019s assessment in his essay (2012). Subsequent\nto this Fried released an updated version of the book in 2015, which\nin turn has spawned a more recent literature (see Markovits 2020;\nSaprai 2013; Bix 2017; Encarnacion 2018)\n\nAnd the legal academy continues to work on the relation between the\nconcepts and the theoretical foundations of contract law, with\nscholars like Markovits (2011), Shiffrin (2006, 2012), Pratt (2007,\n2014) Encarnacion (2018), Saprai (2017) and many others contributing.\nFor an excellent overview of the theoretical work see the SEP entry on\n contract law.\n6.3 Promises and Consequentialism\n\nConsequentialism has always had a fraught relationship with promises\nand promissory obligation. It has been a traditional challenge to\nconsequentialist views, particularly earlier, act-based forms, to\nexplain promissory obligations, as they aren\u2019t necessarily\n\u201cfelicific\u201d, or productive of the most good. Of course,\nnot all consequentialist views are of this sort.\n\nConsequentialist theories of promissory obligation fall into two broad\ncamps: Act utilitarians are expectationalists\u2014generally explain\npromissory obligations as arising from the negative consequences of\nbreaking the promise. Rule utilitarians are conventionalists, and\ndefend promissory obligations on the grounds that the rule of\npromise-keeping is productive of the best consequences.\n6.3.1 Act Utilitarianism\n\nAct utilitarians evaluate individual actions in light of the net\nutility produced by that action as compared to alternative actions.\nThe right action is that which promotes the maximum net utility. On\nthe face of it, this entirely general and comprehensive maxim leaves\nno room for considerations of prior promise. The fact that an agent\npromised someone something has no direct relevance to an act\nconsequentialist appraisal of that agent\u2019s action at the time\nthe promise is meant to be kept. If breaking the promise would promote\nmore utility than keeping it, then the theory seems to mandate\nbreaking the promise.\n\nThis counter-intuitive result has been offered as a criticism of act\nutilitarianism since its inception. That act utilitarians have\ndifficulty in accounting for the force of promises is a touchstone for\ncritics (see Prichard 1949; Ross 1930; Hodgson 1967).\n\nBut act utilitarians do have some resources to accommodate our moral\nintuitions about promises, and the sort of theory they employ is held\nby more than just utilitarians .The act utilitarian explanation for\npromissory obligations is that these obligations arise from the\nnegative consequences that attend the breaking of promises, where\nthese negative consequences are, at least in part, created by the\neffects of the promise on the promisee, specifically, the creation in\nthe promisee of the expectation that the promisor will keep her\npromise. A sample list of utilitarianism that have either offered or\ndefended such a view: Bentham (A Comment on the Commentaries,\n1-1-6), Sidgwick (The Methods of Ethics, 1874 [1962:\n3\u20136]), Narveson (1967, 1971), Singer (1972), and \u00c1rdal\n(1968, 1976).\n\nIn support of this picture utilitarians argue that promises are the\nsorts of things which are generally made because the promisee wants\nthe thing promised, and so wants to be assured of getting it. Since a\npromise is designed to secure his trust, and that trust is then likely\nto be the source of much pain if it\u2019s disappointed, it\u2019s\nreasonable to assume that in most cases keeping one\u2019s promise\nwill be productive of better consequences than breaking them, given\nthe expectations of the promisee. And there are other potential\nnegative consequences of breaking a promise (e.g., the loss of trust\nby one\u2019s familiars, the general erosion of trust in the practice\nof promises) that utilitarians can add to the negative side of the\nledger. For an astute philosophical survey of Act Utilitarian\napproaches to promising see Atiyah (1981: 30\u201379), also Robins\n(1984: 140\u2013143) and Vitek (1993: 61\u201370).\n\nAs mentioned above, the standard critique of the act utilitarian\ntheory of promissory obligations is that it doesn\u2019t accord with\nour intuitive judgment that at least some promises that don\u2019t\nproduce the maximum utility still ought to be kept. In claiming that\nutilitarianism has unacceptably counter-intuitive results in certain\ncases, this argument it is of a piece with most arguments against the\nview. One sort of counter-intuitive case that has received some\nattention is the so-called \u201cDesert Island\u201d case, where a\npromise is made in isolation (on a desert island) to someone who then\ndies. The question is whether there is any obligation to keep the\npromise, given that the promisee can\u2019t have any expectations of\nits fulfillment (being dead) and that no-one else can know of the\npromise (see Nowell-Smith 1956; Narveson 1963: 210; Cargile 1964;\nNarveson 1967: 196\u20137). See the section on\n Problematic Promisees and the Uptake Condition (\u00a75.1]\n above for more information.\n\nA more sophisticated problem outlined by Hodgson (1967: 38) and others\nis that a promising convention is broadly speaking incompatible with\nan act utilitarian society. This is so because such a convention\ncouldn\u2019t get established (or couldn\u2019t be sustained) if\npeople were aware that everyone was a consistent utility maximizer of\nthe act utilitarian sort. If this were the case people would put no\nstock in promises, knowing that when the time came to keep the\npromise, the promisor would simply apply the utilitarian calculus,\nwithout regard to the fact that he had previously\n\u201cpromised\u201d, as this is what being an act utilitarian\nmeans.\n\nNote that the utilitarian cannot reply that we have failed to take\ninto account the expectations of the promisee in our case, because the\nclaim is that the promisee has no reason to generate any special\nexpectations that the promisor will do what she promises, precisely\nbecause he knows the promisor to be an act utilitarian, and\nconsequently knows that she will do what the utility calculus tells\nher is best, without thought of her promise. Of course, the promisee\nis free to generate some expectations that the promisor will keep her\npromise on the assumption that her promise is indicative of her at\nleast having the (present) intention to perform the promised act. But,\nas Raz (1972), Kolodny and Wallace (2003) and others point out, the\nadvising of the promisee of one\u2019s mere intention to do the\npromised act is insufficient ground for the sorts of expectations that\nare meant to attend promises.\n\nMore recently there have been some efforts to rehabilitate act\nutilitarianism with regards to promissory obligations. Some theorists,\nlike Michael Smith (1994, 2011), propose that sophisticating the\ntheory with the addition of other values might allow it to accommodate\n\u201cagent-relative\u201d values like promise keeping (M. Smith\n2011: 208\u2013215).\n\nOthers, like Alastair Norcross, offer a negative defense, arguing that\nthe sorts of counter-examples generally adduced to demonstrate the\nproblem don\u2019t survive scrutiny (Norcross 2011). Norcross also\nproposes an indirect form of consequentialism, one where the decision\nprocedure consciously adopted by agents isn\u2019t the same as theory\nitself. This sort of approach is outlined by Peter Railton (1984).\n6.3.2 Rule Utilitarianism\n\nThe sorts of difficulties that promises pose for act utilitarian\ntheories discussed above are at least in part the motivation for rule\nutilitarianism (see Rawls 1955 and Brandt 1979: 286\u2013305). Rule\nutilitarians change the context of moral evaluation from individual\nacts to rules governing actions. The principle of utility is applied\nto rules and practices, rather than individual acts, and the best rule\nor practice is that produces the best over-all consequences. Some\nnotable rule utilitarians are Urmson (1953), Brandt (1959, 1979), and\nHooker (2000, 2011).\n\nOf special note here is Rawls\u2019 1955 paper we discussed above in\nthe context of conventionalism, \u201cTwo Concepts of Rules\u201d,\nwhich advanced a rule-utilitarian defense of promissory obligations\nand helped to focus the debate on promising By changing the focus from\nact to rule, rule utilitarians are better able to explain our moral\nintuitions regarding individual cases of promise-keeping. But in\nparticular, rule utilitarians claim that their theory can make sense\nof the origin and maintenance of the practice of promising itself.\nUnlike an act utilitarian society, promising and trusting in promises\nmakes sense in a rule utilitarian society, because promisees can rest\nassured that promisors won\u2019t do the local utility calculation to\ndetermine whether or not to keep their promises, but rather will obey\nthe rule of promising.\n\nOne problem for the rule utilitarian theory of promissory obligations\nis that it seems that utilitarian society couldn\u2019t establish a\npractice of promising, because prior to the establishment of the rule,\npeople could have no expectations that promises would be kept. As\nsuch, those receiving the first promises would not be able to form the\nexpectations necessary to make the rule actually productive of the\nbest consequences. This is so because the consequential value of the\nrule of promise keeping depends on the expectations of promisees. Such\nexpectations are the grounds of trust, and trust is how promising\ngenerates its benefits (see Robins 1984: 142\u20133). In response,\nBrandt argues for what he calls ideal rule utilitarianism,\nwhich makes the frame of reference for rule consideration not the\nactual rules available, but the ideal rule, i.e., the rule that would\nbe optimific (productive of the best possible consequences), were it\nemployed. There is substantial criticism of this move (see Diggs\n1970). Again, an excellent (although now dated) survey of the\nrule-utilitarian approach to promising is found in Atiyah (1981:\n79\u201386).\n\nSince the turn of the century Brad Hooker has offered newer versions\nof Brandt-style rule-utilitarianism (he calls it\nrule-consequentialism) (2000, 2011) with an eye towards solving these\nsorts of problems. This work has in turn spawned another chapter in\nthis literature (see Eggleston 2007; Arneson 2005; Wall 2009; Cureton\n2015).\n\nAnd work continues on these issues, see Sinnott-Armstrong (2009), Gill\n(2012), Melenovsky (2017). For an excellent contemporary survey of\nthis issue, see Alida Liberman\u2019s \u201cConsequentialism and\nPromises\u201d in the Oxford Handbook of Consequentialism\n(2020).",
