    "main_text": "Sortals and Logic || Logics of sortals\n8.2 Logics of sortals\n\nStandard logic treats all predicate expressions alike\u2014the\npredicates can be interpreted as any subset of the domain of\nquantification. If any of the claims discussed above about sortals are\ncorrect, then the sortal predicates have distinctive properties, and a\nmore sophisticated logical treatment might provide philosophical\nillumination. One obvious and agreed on principle is that in general\nthe negation of a sortal predicate is not a sortal. This contrasts\nwith the predicates of standard logic where if F is a\npredicate, so is \\(\\neg F\\), (not-F).\n\nThis principle holds regardless of which interpretation of\n\u201csortal\u201d you take. Not only is \u201cis not a cat\u201d\nnot a substantive sortal (Wiggins), you cannot count the non-cats\nsince they include dogs, table, molecules, et cetera.\nHowever, for two of the other logical operators, disjunction and\nconjunction, the situation seems more complex. The expressions\n\u201cdog or cat\u201d, \u201capple or orange\u201d and\n\u201cfork or spoon\u201d all seem to be well-behaved with respect\nto counting and identifying; we can easily imagine a city ordinance\nforbidding homeowners to have more than four dogs or cats. On the\nother hand, \u201cdog or natural number\u201d and \u201ccat or\nclock\u201d seem to provide methods of counting but seem unnatural as\nsortals.\n\nThe first \u201csortal logic\u201d was developed in Stevenson\n(1975). Stevenson develops an account in which he says \u201cWe use\nideas of Geach, Wallace and Wiggins, although we depart from each in\ncertain respects\u201d (1975: 186). Although the formalism follows\nWallace in some respects, the main ideas seem to be those of Wiggins\nrather than Geach. Specifically, his theorem 3.4.5 affirms that for\nany sortals F, G, if b and c are the same\nF, and b is a G, then b and c are\nthe same G, which is a denial of Geach\u2019s relative\nidentity thesis.\n\nTwo principles that Stevenson adopts following Wiggins are:\n\n(i)\n For every sortal F, either F is an ultimate sortal, or there\nis an ultimate sortal G such that F is a restriction\nof G.\n(ii)\n If\ntwo sortals F and G intersect, i.e., they are both true\nof at least one object, then there is a common sortal\nH of which both F and G are restrictions.\n\n\nStevenson proves the formal consistency and completeness of his set of\naxioms. It should be noted that completeness here is with respect to\nthe language used. Since this is a minor adaptation of standard logic,\nthere is no treatment of tense or modality, some essential elements of\nWiggins\u2019s notion of sortal cannot be expressed, e.g., if a\nsortal F applies to b at one time, then it applies to\nb at all times at which b exists, and if a sortal\nF applies to b, then F necessarily applies to\nb.\n\nStevenson does not permit combinations of sortal expressions,\npresumably because there is no easy way to deal with disjunctions and\nconjunctions of sortals in his formulation. However, a slight\ncomplication of his language would suffice to handle the problem. He\nuses \u201cuS\u201d for the ultimate sortal which governs\nsortal \u201cS\u201d. If instead he introduced a set of\nletters \\(U'\\), \\(U''\\) \u2026 for ultimate sortals, he could then\nsuperscript sortal expressions to indicate the ultimate sortal that\ngoverns them. He could then permit the disjunction of \\(S^{U'}\\) and\n\\(T^{U'}\\) since they are governed by the same ultimate sortal, but\nforbid the disjunction of \\(S^{U'}\\) and \\(T^{U''}\\) since they are\ngoverned by different ultimate sortals.\n\nCocchiarella (1977) presents a formal language, though no axioms or\nrules, for a logic of sortals which includes both tense and modal\noperators. His approach, like Wiggins, considers sortals to be\nconcepts. Unlike Wiggins he gives a definition of \u201csortal\nconcept\u201d: as a socio-genetically developed cognitive ability or\ncapacity to distinguish, count and collect or classify things (1977:\n441). He disagrees with Wiggins on both principles\n (i) and (ii) above,\narguing that while they may be true for natural kind terms, there are\nno reasons to believe that there are ultimate sortals of which various\nartifact sortals are restrictions, nor that every intersection of\nsortals must fall under an ultimate sortal. Cocchiarella\u2019s\napproach also goes beyond Stevenson\u2019s in that it involves\nsecond-order logic, i.e., it includes quantification over sortal\nconcepts.\n\nCocchiarella\u2019s ideas have been presented in more rigorous formal\ndetail with axioms and consistency and completeness results for\nsecond-order logic in Freund (2000), tense logic (2001) and modalities\n(2004). More recently, Freund (2019) has formulated several bidimensional logics for sortals that consider modal, tense, and epistemic modalities, as well as complex sortals (i.e., sortals that involve logical combinations of other sortals). These systems presuppose a conceptualist philosophical background closely related to Cocchiarella\u2019s but somewhat more general.\n\nGuarina, Carrara, and Giaretta (1994) develop an account of sortals\nwithin knowledge representation, a subfield of artificial intelligence\nintended to bridge the gap between abstract formal logics and natural\nlanguages. Their definition of a sortal is that it is a predicate that\nprovides countability and is temporally stable. A predicate provides\ncountability if it does not apply to any proper part of what it\napplies to. As they explain this, \u201cstudent\u201d provides\ncountability because no proper part of a student is a student; but\n\u201cred\u201d does not provide countability because parts of red\nthings are also red. Temporal stability means that if the predicate\napplies to something at one time then it must at some other times as\nwell. This is approximately the concept Strawson had in mind. They go\non to distinguish a subset of these, the substantial sortals. A\nsubstantial sortal is one that, if it applies at all, necessarily\napplies all times. This is in close agreement with Wiggins\u2019 use\nof the term. So while \u201cstudent\u201d provides countability and\nis temporally stable, it is not ontologically rigid, so it is a sortal\nbut not a substantial sortal. On the other hand, a cat is always\nnecessarily a cat.\n\nAlthough there are obvious affinities with Strawson and Wiggins, it\nshould be noted that Guarino et al. (1994) are primarily concerned\nwith the distinction between kinds and properties of kinds, while the\nphilosophers were more concerned with things and the stuff they are\nmade of.\n\nBelnap and M\u00fcller develop an alternative account of sortals\nwithin a non-standard formal logic for tense and modality. Unlike the\nusual background of possible worlds for modality, they use ideas from\nBressan (1972) and adopt\ncases as the fundamental background notion They define a\nsortal as a predicate which is modally constant and provides\nseparability. A predicate is modally constant iff it applies\nnecessarily to something whenever it possibly applies. The idea is\nthat while someone might possibly be a student without necessarily\nbeing a student, if they are human they are necessarily human. Thus\n\u201cstudent\u201d is not a sortal but \u201chuman\u201d is. A\npredicate is modally separated just in case it is necessarily true\nthat if any two things having the property are possibly identical,\nthen they are in fact necessarily identical. Using their technical\nterminology of cases, if two things which have a modally separated\nproperty coincide in any case, then they coincide in every case.\nBelnap and M\u00fcller are explicit that they are providing a formal\nframework for classifying predicates, but that applications will\nrequire other kinds of thought:\n\n\nwhether a particular predicate is absolute is assumed to be not a\nmatter of logic, but rather of science and metaphysics. (Belnap &\nM\u00fcller 2014: 397)\n\n\nWhile there is a shared core of concerns in these last two approaches,\nit is clear that in addition to the superficial difference that Belnap\nand M\u00fcller restrict \u201csortal\u201d to approximately the\nsubstantial sortals as defined in Guarino et al. 1994, there are\ndifferences even in the area of overlap. Modal rigidity and modal\nconstancy are very similar. (Some caution is necessary here since the\nmodal logic frameworks differ.) But Belnap and M\u00fcller emphasize\nmodal separability and do not mention a counting requirement, Guarino\net al. (1994) require countability but are not concerned with modal\nidentities.\n\nIn addition to Guarino et al. (1994), computational applications of the notion of sortal can be found recently in upper ontology, a relatively new field in computer sciences. For example, Guizzardi and Wagner (2010) make central use of the notion of sortal in a conceptual framework they call Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO). This framework can be used in the design and evaluation of conceptual modeling languages. In UFO, the focus on sortals is on the identity criteria they provide, which contrasts with Guarino et al. (1994) where the emphasis is put instead on countability and persistence. Besides, UFO makes a distinction, among sortals, between rigid and anti-rigid sortals. An instance of a rigid sortal S will be an instance of S in every possible world in which it exists. Anti-rigid sortals will not comply with this feature. From the authors\u2019 examples and further claims, it is clear that rigid sortals correspond to substance sortals and anti-rigid to phase sortals. Because possible worlds are involved, UFO\u2019s framework seems to be committed to individual essentialism. One will then ask whether UFO\u2019s general goal is achievable, given the critique of such essentialism by philosophers of biology. We should finally note that one can also appeal to a tense logic framework to illuminate the distinction between substance and phase sortals, in contrast with UFO\u2019s modal approach.(See Rybola and Pergl (2016a, 2016b) for further examples of recent applications of the notion of sortal in computational ontology.) \n",
