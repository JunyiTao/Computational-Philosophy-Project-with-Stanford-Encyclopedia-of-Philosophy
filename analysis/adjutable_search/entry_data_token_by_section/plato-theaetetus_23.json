The first\nattempt to give an account of \u201caccount\u201d takes\nlogos just to mean \u201cspeech\u201d or\n\u201cstatement.\u201d This is deemed obviously insufficient\n(206c1\u2013206e3).\n\n\nA second attempted explanation of \u201clogos of O\u201d\ntakes it as \u201cenumeration of the elements of\nO.\u201d The logos is a statement of the\nelements of the object of knowledge. You have knowledge of\nsomething when, in addition to your true belief about it, you are able\nalso to \u201cgo through the elements\u201d of that thing.\n\n\nPlato\u2019s objection to this proposal (208b) is that it leaves open the\npossibility that someone could count as having knowledge of the name\n\u201cTheaetetus\u201d even if they could do no more than write out\nthe letters of the name \u201cTheaetetus\u201d in the right\norder. Since such a person can enumerate the elements of the complex,\ni.e., the letters of the name (207c8\u2013d1), he has an account. Since he\ncan arrange those letters in their correct order (208a9\u201310), he also\nhas true belief. For all that, insists Plato, he does not have\nknowledge of the name \u201cTheaetetus.\u201d\n\n\nWhy not, we might ask? To see the answer we should bring in what Plato\nsays about syllables at 207d8\u2013208a3. Suppose someone could enumerate\nthe letters of \u201cTheaetetus,\u201d and could give their correct\norder, and yet knew nothing about syllables. This person wouldn\u2019t\ncount as knowing \u201cTheaetetus\u201d because he would have no\nunderstanding of the principles that get us from ordered letters to\nnames. Those principles are principles about how letters form\nsyllables, and how syllables form names. A person who can\nstate only the letters of \u201cTheaetetus\u201d and their order has\nno awareness of these principles.\n\n\nTo put it a modern way, a robot or an automatic typewriter might be\nable to reproduce or print the letters of \u201cTheaetetus\u201d\ncorrectly and in order. It might even be able to store such a correct\nordering in its electronic memory. That would not show that such a\nmachine understood how to spell \u201cTheaetetus,\u201d any\nmore than the symbol-manipulating capacities of the man in Searle\u2019s\nChinese Room show that he understands Chinese. What is missing is an\nawareness of bridging or structuring principles, rules explaining\nhow we get from strings of symbols, via syllables,\nto representations of Greek names. \n\n\nKnowledge of such bridging principles can reasonably be called\nknowledge of why the letters of \u201cTheaetetus\u201d are\nwhat they are. So it is plausible to suggest that the moral of the\nargument is to point us to the need for an account in the sense of an\nexplanation \u201cWhy?,\u201d and so to the version of\nD3 that Plato himself accepts.\n\n\nThe third proposed account of logos says that to give the\nlogos of O is to cite the s\u00eameion or\ndiaphora of O. In the Wax Tablet passage,\ns\u00eameion meant \u2018imprint\u2019; in the present\npassage, it means the \u2018sign\u2019 or diagnostic feature wherein\nx differs from everything else, or everything else of\nO\u2019s own kind. So, presumably, knowledge of (say) Theaetetus\nconsists in true belief about Theaetetus plus an account of what\ndifferentiates Theaetetus from every other human.\n\n\nSocrates offers two objections to this proposal. First, if knowledge\nof Theaetetus requires a mention of his s\u00eameion, so\ndoes true belief about Theaetetus. Second, to possess\n\u201can account of Theaetetus\u2019 s\u00eameion\u201d must\nmean either (a) having true belief about that s\u00eameion,\nor else (b) having knowledge of it. But it has already been pointed\nout that any true belief, if it is to qualify as being about\nTheaetetus at all, must already be true belief about his\ns\u00eameion. So interpretation (a) has the result that\nknowledge of Theaetetus = true belief about Theaetetus\u2019\ns\u00eameion + true belief about Theaetetus\u2019\ns\u00eameion. As for (b): if we want to know what knowledge\nis, it is no help to be told that knowledge of O = something\nelse + knowledge of the s\u00eameion of\nO. We still need to know what knowledge of the\ns\u00eameion of O is. Nor will it help us to be\nlaunched on a vicious regress: as we will be if we are told that\nknowledge of the s\u00eameion of O = something else\n+ knowledge of the s\u00eameion of the\ns\u00eameion of O.  \n\n\nThis is where the argument ends, and Socrates leaves to meet his\naccusers.\n",
