    "main_text": "Classical Period || The emergence of a canonical syllogism\n3.2 The emergence of a canonical syllogism\n\nThe earliest known example of the canonical Indian syllogism is found\nin the Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101. The argument is clearly an\nanalogical one. The earliest known deductive version of the syllogism\nis found in the F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n, or\nUp\u0101ya-h\u1e5bdaya; and the earliest known discussion of\na deductive version of the syllogism is found in the\nR\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n, usually referred to as the\nTarka-\u015b\u0101stra. A concise version of the deductive\nversion is found in Vasubandhu\u2019s V\u0101da-vidhi.\n\nThe Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 (CS 3.8.31), like the\nNy\u0101ya-s\u016btra (NS 1.1.32), takes the syllogism to\nhave five parts, the names for four of them being identical; however,\nunlike the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, the\nCaraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 provides an illustration of the\nsyllogism.\n\ncanonical syllogism (analogical)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nThe soul is eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause of being un-produced. \n\nexample:\nSpace is unproduced and it is eternal. \n\napplication:\nAnd just as space is unproduced, so is the soul. \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, the soul is eternal.  \n\n\n\nObserve that the first three statements in the syllogism have the form\nof the analogical syllogism using similarity as discussed above: p,\nthe soul, has S, the property of being eternal, because p, the soul,\nhas H, the property of being unproduced; as d, or space, has H, the\nproperty of being unproduced, and d, space, has S, the property of\nbeing eternal. However, the argument here adds two more statements:\nthe first spells out the analogy between the subject of the\nproposition and the example, using the correlative expression\nas (yath\u0101) \u2026 so\n(tath\u0101) \u2026; the second restates the\nargument\u2019s proposition.\n\nWhile Caraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101 provides only one\nillustration of its canonical syllogism, the earliest extant\ncommentary on the Ny\u0101ya-s\u016btra, called the\nNy\u0101ya-bh\u0101\u1e63ya (Commentary on logic),\nhas passages in its commentary on NS 1.1.33\u201339, which permit the\nreconstruction of two analogical syllogisms, corresponding to those\nusing similarity and using dissimilarity discussed above. The\ncommentary, attributed to V\u0101tsy\u0101yana (fifth ce),\nalso known as Pak\u1e63ilasv\u0101min,\nexplicitly distinguishes the syllogisms as one based on similarity\n(s\u0101dharmya) and the other based on dissimilarity\n(vaidharmya) discussed earlier. (For details, see Gillon\n2020.) The analogical syllogism based on similarity differs but\nslightly from the syllogism found in the\nCaraka-sa\u1e43hit\u0101.\n\nThe F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n, or\nUp\u0101ya-h\u1e5bdaya, purports to be a primer on argument\nand reasoning, listing and defining many terms. It also contains many\narguments, several of which are analogical arguments both through\nsimilarity and through dissimilarity. The author of the text neither\nstates what an argument is nor what its parts are. Yet, in the first\nchapter, he speaks of excessive and deficient statements and says that\nthere are three kinds: deficiency of reason, deficiency of proposition\nand deficiency of example. (T1632 24.3.14\u201318; Gillon and Katsura\n2017 p. 215). Arguments which are not deficient in any of these ways\nis said to be complete. From the illustrations, it is clear that a\nnondeficient argument has the form: p has S, because of having H, like\nd, where d is assumed to have both H and S. In other words, a complete\nargument could be spelled out in the form whose explicit counterpart\nwould be that of an analogical syllogism using similarity of the kind\nfound in the polemical texts discussed earlier.\n\nThe only argument to appear in a form with five parts is given in the\nfourth, or last, chapter (T1632 28.1.4\u20136). Here is the argument\nas it occurs with the labels for the parts supplied for ease\ncomparison. Though the Chinese equivalent of proposition,\nreason and example appear in the text, the\nequivalents of application and conclusion do\nnot.\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nThe self is eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause it is not perceptible by the senses. \n\nexample:\nSpace, because of not being perceptible by senses, is\neternal. \n\n\u00a0\nEverything which is not perceptible by senses\nis eternal. \n\napplication:\nAnd the self is not perceptible by senses. \n\nconclusion:\nCould the self possibly be non-eternal?  \n\n\n\nNote that example statement comprises two sentences: the first\nrestates what is expressed in the proposition and reason statements,\nthe second affirms a universal proposition, everything which is\nnot perceptible by senses is eternal. The example statement\ncomprises a deductively valid argument, as does the second sentence\ntogether with the reason and proposition statements. Surprisingly, the\nauthor rejects the syllogism as a bad one. The rejection is justified\nby an argument by analogy through dissimilarity.\n\nWhen we turn to the R\u00fash\u00ed l\u00f9n,\ncustomarily referred to as the Tarka-\u015b\u0101stra, we\nfind the logical situation has changed. A deductive syllogism similar\nto the one just set out is endorsed. Moreover, analogical syllogisms\nare explicitly rejected. For example, the text rejects the following\nanalogical syllogism (T1633 30.3.2\u20134).\n\ncanonical syllogism (analogical)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nSound is not eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause, arising due to an effort, it arises immediately.\n\n\nexample:\nAs a clay vessel, arising due to an effort, and\nhaving arisen, perishes, \n\napplication:\nsound too is that way. \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, sound is not eternal.  \n\n\n\nThat the syllogism is analogical is made clear by the formulation of\nthe example and application statements.\n\nWhat the text\u2019s author advocates instead are syllogisms which\nare in fact deductively valid, similar to the syllogism cited and\nrejected in the F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n x\u012bn l\u00f9n.\nHere is one example (T1633 30.3.7\u201310).\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid)\n\n\n\nproposition:\nSound is not eternal \n\nreason:\nbecause, arising due to an effort, it arises immediately.\n\n\nexample:\nIf a thing is eternal, (then) it does not arise due to an\neffort. For example, space is eternal and does not arise due to an\neffort. \n\napplication:\nSound too is not that way. \n\nconclusion:\nTherefore, sound is not eternal.  \n\n\n\nThis argument, like the one rejected in F\u0101ng bi\u00e0n\nx\u012bn l\u00f9n, is deductively valid. The example statement\nalso comprises two sentences: the first, however, affirms a universal\nproposition, If a thing is eternal, (then) it does not arise due\nto an effort, and the second states an instance of the universal\nproposition, which is distinct from the subject of the argument. The\nproposition and reason statements, together with the first sentence of\nthe example statement, comprise a deductively valid argument.\n\nMoreover, we know that the author is fully aware of the\nsyllogism\u2019s logical force, for he states the three conditions,\nor three forms (tri-r\u016bpa), which a reason must satisfy\nfor the argument in which it occurs to be sound.\n\n\nthree forms (T1633 30.3.18\u201326):\n\nThe reason you set forth is not definite because eternality and\nnon-eternality appear throughout it. The reason I set forth has the\nthree marks. (1) The (reason) is a property of the subject, (2) it is\nincluded in things similar and (3) it is excluded from things\ndissimilar. Therefore, the reason I set forth succeeds in not\ndeviating, your reason does not. Therefore, your objection is\nconfused. If the reason you set forth were like my reason (in this\nrespect), your objection would succeed in being a proper\nobjection.\n\n\nAs noted by H. Ui 1929 (reported in Katsura 1985 p. 166), the earliest\nmention of the three forms appears in a brief passage in a non-logical\ntext, Sh\u00f9n zh\u014dng l\u00f9n (T1565 42a12,22ff).\nHowever, the author of this text, said to be Asa\u1e45ga, rejects the\ncriterion, a criterion thought to be of a non-Buddhist origin.\n\nFinally we come to Vasubandhu\u2019s V\u0101da-vidhi. Here\nthe endorsed argument retains the proposition and the reason, abandons\nthe application and the conclusion and simplifies the example, so that\nthe resulting syllogism has this form:\n\ncanonical syllogism (deductively valid):\nVasubandhu\n\n\n\nproposition:\np has S \n\nreason:\nbecause p has H. \n\nexample:\nThat which has H has S, like d. \n\n\u00a0\n(where d, distinct from p, has properties H and S). \n\n\n\n\nIt harks back to the form of the inferential syllogism mentioned\nearlier in our discussion of the\n\u1e62a\u1e63\u1e6di-tantra and the\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika-s\u016btra. However, there is one\ncrucial difference: Vasubandhu is absolutely clear that the example\nstatement expresses an indispensability relation\n(a-vin\u0101-bh\u0101va: lit. not existing without,\nor sine qua non). As is clear, instances of this schema are\ndeductively valid arguments.\n",
