    "main_text": "Virtue and moral character after the Greeks || Kant\n3.2 Kant\n\nThe tendencies to find room for motive and character in the area of\nimperfect duty, and to assimilate virtue with continence, resurface in\nthe writings of several moral philosophers of the 17th and\n18th centuries. Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) is an\nillustrative case. In the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant divides\nmoral philosophy into two domains, that of justice or law on the one\nhand (the Doctrine of Right), and that of ethics or virtue on\nthe other (the Doctrine of Virtue). The duties that form the\nsubject matter of the Doctrine of Right are like the natural\nlaw theorists\u2019 perfect duties: they are precise, owed to\nspecifiable others, and can be legally enforced. They require that we\ntake or forego certain actions. Other duties (which form the subject\nmatter of the Doctrine of Virtue) are duties to adopt certain\nends. Many of them are imperfect, in that they do not specify how,\nwhen, or for whom (in the case of duties to others) they should be\nachieved. Examples are the duty not to let one\u2019s talents rust or\nthe duty not to deny help to others. Because we cannot be compelled to\nadopt ends, but must do so from free choice, these duties are not\nlegally enforceable. They require inner, not outer, legislation, so we\nmust impose them on ourselves. Because, according to Kant, we are\nalways fighting against the impulses and dispositions that oppose the\nmoral law, we need strength of will and self-mastery to fulfill our\nimperfect duties. This self-mastery Kant calls courage. \n\nThat virtue is a form of continence for Kant is also suggested by his\ntreatment of other traits such as gratitude and sympathy. Although\nKant thinks that feelings cannot be required of anyone, some feelings\nare nevertheless associated with the moral ends we adopt. If we adopt\nothers\u2019 happiness as an end, we will not take malicious pleasure\nin their downfall. On the contrary, we will naturally feel gratitude\nfor their benevolence and sympathy for their happiness. These feelings\nwill make it easier for us to perform our duties and are a sign that\nwe are disposed to do so. Kant remarks of sympathy that \u201cit is\none of the impulses that nature has implanted in us to do what the\nrepresentation of duty alone would not accomplish\u201d (Kant,\nMetaphysics of Morals, Ak. 457).\n\nThus it matters to Kant that we perform the duties of virtue with the\nproperly cultivated emotions. But to do so is not to develop our\nnature so that the two parts of us, reason and passion, are unified\nand speak with the same voice. Rather, if we perform our duties of\nvirtue in the right spirit, one part of us, reason, retains control\nover the other part, passion. Kant writes that virtue \u201ccontains\na positive command to a man, namely to bring all his capacities and\ninclinations under his (reason\u2019s) control and so to rule over\nhimself \u2026 for unless reason holds the reins of government in\nits own hands, man\u2019s feelings and inclinations play the master\nover him\u201d (Kant, Metaphysics of Morals, Ak. 408).\n\nFor more detailed discussion of Kant\u2019s views on virtue, see\nO\u2019Neill (1996).\n\nYet there are other philosophers for whom an interest in virtue or\ngood character takes a turn more reminiscent of the Greeks. This\nrevival of Greek ideas can be seen in philosophers who show an\ninterest in the psychological foundations of good character.\n",
