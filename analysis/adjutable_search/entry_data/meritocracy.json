    "main_text": "\n1. Meritocracy: A Brief History\n\nBy tradition, Michael Young is credited with coining\n\u201cmeritocracy\u201d for his 1958 satire, The Rise of the\nMeritocracy. In fact, the term appeared in print two years\nearlier: In Jean Floud\u2019s \u201cSociology and Education\u201d,\nAlan Fox\u2019s \u201cClass and Equality\u201d, and Paul Lamartine\nYates\u2019s \u201cFairer Shares\u201d. Young claimed to have\ninvented it, which is certainly possible given that all four were\nEnglish academics who moved in similar, leftist circles. While only\nYoung explained what he meant by \u201cmeritocracy\u201d in any\ndetail (and his sentiments towards it were mixed), for these\nacademics, the term had a negative connotation.\n\nNow it has been claimed that \u201cmeritocracy\u201d first appeared\nin Hannah Arendt\u2019s \u201c1954\u201d article \u201cThe Crisis\nin Education\u201d. And there are copies of this article, so dated,\ncirculating on the Internet which include the term. However,\n\u201cThe Crisis in Education\u201d came out in 1958 (and was based\non \u201ca lecture delivered at Bremen, May 13, 1958\u201d).\nFurther, \u201cmeritocracy\u201d does not appear in that original\nversion of Arendt\u2019s article. It does appear in edited reprints\nof it (e.g., Arendt 1961).\n\nOnly the briefest survey of the history of meritocracy can be provided\nhere. For the ideas that government should be populated by the\nmeritorious, and that a just distribution is merit-based, are\nubiquitous. As Louis Pojman says,\n\n\nit is interesting to observe how deeply the notion of justice as\ndesert or merit is embedded in human history. It seems a\nprereflective, basic idea of primordial or Ur-justice. One finds it\ngrounded in every known culture and religion. (1999: 90)\n\n\n(Pojman surveys some history; Wooldridge 2021 is more\ncomprehensive.)\n\nThere is an Eastern meritocratic tradition which has its roots in\nConfucius (551\u2013479 BC). This tradition has influenced political\nand social institutions in Asia and beyond and remains vibrant\n (\u00a73.1).\n (Meritocratic notions are found elsewhere in ancient Chinese thought,\ntoo; e.g., the Mohists [c. 400 BC] sought to \u201celevate the\nworthy\u201d into government for utilitarian reasons. See Pines\n2013.)\n\nThe core ideas of this tradition are found in Confucius, Mencius\n(372\u2013289 BC), and Xunzi (c. 310\u2013c. 235 BC). In short: The\npurpose of government is to promote the well-being and virtue of the\npeople. That requires that political power be wielded not on the basis\nof noble blood\u2014the prevailing system\u2014but virtue and\ntalent. Political leaders serve as role models and sage\ndecision-makers, and to do that they must be meritorious.\n\nSuch a system will create hierarchies. For these meritocrats, that is\nnot a problem. Indeed, it is natural and welcome:\n\n\nThat things are unequal is a matter of fact\u2026. If you rank them\nthe same, it will bring confusion to the world. If a roughly finished\nshoe sells at the same price as a finely finished one, who would make\nthe latter? \u2026 How can one govern a state in this way?\n(Mencius, 3A.4, trans. Bai [2020: 103])\n\n\nThe most famous realization of the Eastern meritocratic tradition was\nthe Imperial Examinations, which began in China during the Sui Dynasty\n(AD 581\u2013618). Until that point, entry into the state bureaucracy\nwas mainly controlled via nepotism and aristocratic\ninfluence. (Although there was some openness to granting political\npower to competent and virtuous people, even if they came from the\nlower class, since the Qin Dynasty [226\u2013206 BC]. For a\ndiscussion of meritocratic practices before the Imperial Examinations,\nsee Wang 2017.) The Imperial Examinations replaced, to some extent,\nthat route to power with a single, impartial, rigorous examination,\nwhich was open to the public. Although the Imperial Examinations were\ndiscontinued in the early twentieth century, similar civil service\nexaminations proliferated, and today are used world-wide (including in\nChina).\n\nThe Eastern meritocratic tradition is largely concerned with\ngovernance. It does not hold that other social goods, like\nnon-political jobs or income, should be distributed on the basis of\nmerit. And its justification is largely consequentialist: People will\nbe more virtuous, and better cared-for, if they are ruled by the\nmeritorious. Although some meritocratic institutions, like the\nImperial Examinations, might have laudable side-effects like improving\nsocial mobility, they are not generally justified on those\ngrounds.\n\nPlato\u2019s (c. 428\u2013c. 348 BC) meritocratic political theory\n(found primarily in the Laws, Republic, and\nStatesman) is similarly focused on governance. His argument\nfor meritocracy and against democracy is simple: Managing a state is\nhard. It requires specific skills, like bravery, sobriety,\ngraciousness, and love of wisdom. These skills are not found among the\ncommon people or the wealthy. If political power were entrusted to\nthem, the \u201cship of state\u201d (Republic\n488a\u201389c) would run aground. Not to mention, the\nsailors\u2014democratically-elected leaders\u2014are always\nsquabbling. Only a \u201ctrue pilot\u201d\u2014a\nphilosopher-king\u2014can safely guide his ship to its\ndestination. (See also, e.g., Republic 412a-e, 473c-d, and\n484a ff.)\n\nHow Plato justifies meritocracy is a debated matter of interpretation.\nOn one interpretation, meritocracy is desirable for its good\nconsequences; to wit, it brings justice and happiness to the state\n(and, by analogy, citizens\u2019 souls). On another interpretation,\nmeritocracy constitutes justice and happiness, which are\nintrinsically desirable. (On this interpretive issue, see, e.g., Brown\n2003 [2017].)\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BC) is different in that his concern (in the\nNicomachean Ethics and the Politics) is the\ndistribution of social goods generally\u2014not just political\noffices. And his justification for merit-based distribution is\nsquarely deontological. (At least, that is a common interpretation. On\nAristotle\u2019s theory of distributive justice, see, e.g., Keyt\n1991.)\n\nJustice is, for Aristotle, giving people what they deserve, and this\nhappens when they are rewarded in proportion to their merit. (This\nview is arguably presaged by Plato in the Laws [757c] and the\nRepublic [331e ff.]) Indeed, for Aristotle this is\nnot just correct but obvious: \u201cAll men agree that what is just\nin distribution must be according to merit\n[\u1f00\u03be\u03af\u03b1]\u201d (NE, 1131a, trans. Ross\n[1925]).\n\nAristotelian desert defines a notion of equality, known as\nproportional equality. (It is most frequently studied within\nsocial psychology, under the heading equity theory.) What\nAristotle seeks to equalize are the ratios of merits to\nrewards between persons.\n\nFor example, suppose that there are 100 units of some good to be\ndistributed among 3 persons. Persons A and B are\nequally meritorious; C is twice as meritorious as they are.\nJustice is done by giving 25 units of the good to A, 25 units\nto B, and 50 units to C. Note that an equal\ndistribution is just only in the special case in which all recipients\nare equally meritorious.\n\nNow, what is merit? For Aristotle, this is determined by the nature of\nthe thing being distributed:\n\n\nWhen a number of flute players are equal in their art, there is no\nreason why those of them who are better born should have better flutes\ngiven to them \u2026 the superior instrument should be reserved for\nhim who is the superior artist. (Politics, 1282b, trans.\nJowett [1885])\n\n\nMeritocratic ideas are found in Islamic philosophy, in which scholars\ndeveloped political theories compatible with divinely revealed Islamic\nlaw (Shar\u012b\u2019a). For example,\nAl-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b (also known as Alpharabius, AD c.\n870\u2013c. 950) sought a political system which would bring\nhappiness and perfection to the people living under it. Democracy\ncould not do this (although it had, for al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, some\nadmirable features). What is required, rather, is (i) a ruler who is a\nhybrid philosopher-king and prophet-im\u0101m, with\nqualifications drawn from both Platonic and Islamic thought, and (ii)\nan elaborated hierarchy between citizens. Similar ideas may be found\nin the work of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Avicenna, AD c. 980\u20131037),\nIbn B\u0101jja (Avempace, AD c. 1085\u2013c. 1139), and Ibn Rushd\n(Averroes, AD 1126\u20131198).\n\nFrancesco Patrizi of Siena (AD 1413\u20131494) argued that\nmerit\u2014understood as virtue\u2014was a precondition for the\nlegitimate exercise of political power. For Patrizi, a meritocratic\nstate is justified, stable, and functional. Further, the state is\nresponsible for inculcating virtue in its citizens so that they are\nsufficiently meritorious to participate in government. This requires,\namong other things, a public literacy program. Patrizi designed his\npolitical institutions to ensure that (i) only meritorious citizens\n(i.e., the educated and experienced) would be chosen as magistrates\nand senators, and (ii) wealthy and powerful families could not corrupt\nthe political process. (On the almost-forgotten Patrizi, see Hankins\n2023.)\n\nMeritocracy was an important Enlightenment value. Thinkers in Europe\nand elsewhere sought grounds for regarding people as individuals\n(rather than undifferentiated group members) and replacing monarchical\npolitics.\n\nFor instance, Article VI of the Declaration of the Rights of Man\nand of the Citizen (1789) says:\n\n\nAll citizens, being equal in the eyes of the law, shall be equally\neligible to all dignities, public positions and occupations, according\nto their ability, and without distinction except that of their virtues\nand talents.\n\n\nThis is almost precisely the meritocratic rule for distributing jobs\n (\u00a74.2).\n\nNapoleon lived up to this principle, adopting the slogan la\ncarri\u00e8re est ouverte aux talents\u2014careers open to\ntalents\u2014and ascribing his success (not entirely, of course) to\nthe meritocratic nature of his reign.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Thomas Jefferson desired a \u201cnatural\naristocracy\u201d for his new nation, in which hierarchies would\nreflect \u201cvirtue and talents\u201d rather than \u201cwealth and\nbirth\u201d. Indeed, Jefferson regarded this natural aristocracy as\n\u201cthe most precious gift of nature, for the \u2026 government\nof society\u201d (1813).\n\nThere is also a meritocratic ideal of justice associated with the\nUnited States. This is the American Dream, expressed by the\nperson who coined the phrase thus:\n\n\nIt is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely, but a dream of\na social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to\nattain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and\nbe recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the\nfortuitous circumstances of birth or position. (James Adams 1931:\n404)\n\n\nThe suggestion is that a just state is one in which there is equal\nopportunity and people are judged on their merits\n (\u00a74).\n2. Conceptual Issues\n2.1 What is merit?\n\n\u201cMerit\u201d connotes worth, quality, virtue, excellence, and\nmore. If we are to build a society upon merit, as meritocrats desire,\nit seems necessary to understand exactly what merit is. Yet conceptual\nanalysis of merit is nascent (see Clavero Garc\u00eda 2023; Vlastos\n[1962] also offers some comments).\n\nOne thing that is clear is that merit is a contextual phenomenon, as\nAristotle suggested\n (\u00a71).\n We cannot answer the question of whether some person (book, painting,\netc.) is meritorious unless we have a context in mind. If, in the\nmiddle of a discussion about the all-time great baseball players, one\nasks, \u201cwas Albert Einstein meritorious?\u201d, the appropriate\nanswer is \u201cno\u201d. To be sure, we talk about people being\nmeritorious simpliciter. We say things like, \u201cEinstein\nwas a meritorious man\u201d. But in these cases we understand the\ncontext implicitly.\n\nIt is also possible to broadly condemn a person while conceding his\nmerit within a narrow context. One may say that Hitler had merit as an\nartist without making any commitments to his merit in other contexts,\nor to his overall merit.\n\nA crucial conceptual issue is the relationship between merit and its\nreal-world effects. Especially when it comes to governance\n (\u00a73),\n meritocracy is frequently justified by the good outcomes it creates.\nAnd this much seems incontrovertible: All else equal, a meritorious\npolitician will make higher-quality decisions than an unmeritorious\none.\n\nBut this is not necessarily true. Merit, which is internal,\nis distinct from the outcomes which issue from it. The outcomes are\nexternal, although they are sometimes used as evidence of\nmerit. A Nobel Prize in physics is good evidence that Jones is a\nmeritorious physicist. But it is no guarantee: Jones could have stolen\nthe research that won him the Prize, falsely publishing it under his\nown name.\n\nAs Hume puts in the Treatise:\n\n\nThe external performance has no merit. We must look within to find the\nmoral quality. This we cannot do directly; and therefore fix our\nattention on actions, as on external signs. But these actions are\nstill considered as signs; and the ultimate object of our praise and\napprobation is the motive, that produc\u2019d them. (1739\u201340:\n3.2.1)\n\n\nAn example, which we will return to, illustrates the importance of the\nmerit-outcomes distinction. Suppose that Daryl and John are applying\nfor jobs at the widget factory. Daryl is more skilled than John, works\nfaster, is more careful, more collegial, and so on. But this factory\nis filled with racists and Daryl belongs to the disfavored race. As a\nresult, Daryl would perform worse\u2014make fewer widgets per\nhour\u2014than John would. (This is a case of taste\ndiscrimination\u2014Becker 1957.)\n\nObserve that, conceptually, Daryl remains more meritorious than John\neven though hiring John would generate better outcomes. Those who\nsupport hiring John rather than Daryl\u2014utilitarians,\nsay\u2014would not claim otherwise. They would simply say that here\nthere are good reasons to hire the less meritorious applicant.\n\nRonald Dworkin once held a contrary view:\n\n\nIf a black skin will, as a matter of regrettable fact, enable another\ndoctor to do a different medical job better, then that black skin is\nby the same token \u201cmerit\u201d as well. (1985: 299)\n\n\nBut later he recanted (as Segall [2012] points out):\n\n\nI do not mean \u2026 that black color is in itself a virtue or an\naspect of merit\u2026. We do not count a person\u2019s height as a\nvirtue or a merit. But someone who is tall may just for that reason be\nbetter able to contribute, on a basketball court, to one of a\nuniversity\u2019s traditional goals, and in the same way, though for\nsadder reasons, someone who is black may for that reason be better\nable to contribute to its other goals, in the classroom and dormitory\nand in the course of his or her later career. (2000: 404)\n\n\nThe meritocrat must decide whether merit-based distribution is\ndesirable on consequentialist or categorical grounds. If the former,\nthen meritocracy will be valuable only contingently. For at least in\nprinciple, merit-based distribution may lead to suboptimal outcomes.\nOn other hand, meritocrats who say that merit-based distribution is\ncategorically desirable\u2014because, for example, it gives people\nwhat they deserve\n (\u00a74)\u2014must\n concede that their system will not always produce the best\nresults.\n2.2 Merit and desert\n\nMerit\u2019s closest conceptual cousin is desert, the\nconcept underlying commonplace claims like \u201cJoe deserves the\njob\u201d and \u201cworkers deserve higher wages\u201d. As we shall\nsee\n (\u00a74.1),\n some meritocrats explicitly invoke desert in their theories of\njustice. And desert is implicit in much other work on meritocracy.\n(Seminal research on desert includes Feinberg 1963, Kleinig 1971, and\nSher 1987.)\n\nThere is no consensus about the precise link between merit and desert.\nThomas Mulligan (2018b) argues that merit is an important basis for\ndesert and thereby has moral force. Jeppe von Platz (2022) uses\n\u201cdesert\u201d to describe an agent\u2019s character and\n\u201cmerit\u201d to characterize the real-world effects (e.g.,\nachievements) of that character. John Lucas (1980) uses the terms in\njust the opposite way. Owen McLeod says that merit is \u201cquite a\nspecific kind of desert\u201d (1999: 67). Pojman disagrees:\n\u201cMerit is a broader concept, the genus of which desert is the\nspecies\u201d (1999: 86). No attempt has yet been made to evaluate\nthese disparate views, let alone reconcile them. Observe, too, that\nmerit and desert are sometimes used synonymously\u2014we might say\nthat Sam \u201cdeserves the prize\u201d or, apparently equivalently,\nSam \u201cmerits the prize\u201d.\n\nTwo of desert\u2019s conceptual features are especially relevant to\nmeritocracy. First, desert is a pre-institutional notion.\nWhat a person deserves is not, and cannot be, determined by the rules\n(organizations, practices, etc.) governing distribution. Rather,\ndesert should determine those rules.\n\nImagine a race in which all blonde runners get a 10 second head start.\nThe race is run, and a blonde beats a brunette by a nose.\nInstitutionally\u2014within the rules of this race\u2014the blonde\nshould get the medal. But she does not deserve it. The\nbrunette deserves the medal; she was fastest. For the desertist, the\nbrunette ought, morally, to receive it. The blonde is merely\n\u201centitled\u201d to the medal. Further, for the desertist, this\nis a bad race; its rules ought to be changed so that institutional\nentitlements line up with deserts.\n\nIn contrast, a libertarian view of justice denies that there is a\ndeeper, fiducial standard against which the institution can be judged\n (\u00a75.4).\n So long as all the runners freely chose to participate in this race\n(and weren\u2019t misled about the rules, etc.) the blonde ought,\nmorally, to receive the medal. The fact that rules do not ensure that\nthe fastest runner receive the medal is, for the libertarian,\nirrelevant to justice. (For discussion of desert-based versus\nentitlement-based arguments, see Olsaretti 2003a.)\n\nSecond, desert is often thought to contain principles of\naboutness and fitness. The aboutness principle holds\nthat the basis for desert must be \u201cabout\u201d (somehow\nconstrued) the subject of a desert-claim for that claim to be bona\nfide. One cannot, for example, deserve prison on the basis of\nsomeone else\u2019s crimes. One common construal of aboutness is\nresponsibility\u2014if a person is not responsible for a\ncrime, he cannot deserve prison for it.\n\nArguments abound about the influence of luck on people\u2019s\ncharacter and achievements. Luck plausibly severs aboutness and\nthereby people\u2019s claims to deserve on the basis of their merit.\nIf Jones is the most meritorious applicant because of his hard work,\nhe has a strong case to deserve the job. If Jones is meritorious\nbecause he had the good luck of being raised in a rich family, things\nare murkier.\n\nThe fitness principle holds that there is a natural connection between\nthe basis for desert and the object being awarded. If a person commits\na crime, he deserves prison\u2014not a medal. Prison fits crime; a\nmedal is unfitting.\n\nAs will be discussed in\n \u00a74,\n meritocrats debate what the appropriate understanding of\n\u201cmerit\u201d is when it comes to distributing political\noffices, jobs, income, and other goods. Does a just, meritocratic wage\nreflect a person\u2019s skill? His effort? The\ncontribution he makes? Or is \u201cmerit\u201d conceptually\nprimitive, unable to be defined in any of these terms?\n2.3 Equal opportunity\n\nA classic example of meritocracy (perhaps first used by Lyndon Johnson\nin a 4 June 1965 address at Howard University) is a footrace. Justice\nis done\u2014the race is fair\u2014only if the medal is given to the\nrunner who crosses the finish line first (and not, say, to the runner\nwith the lightest skin). However, that is a necessary, not a\nsufficient, condition for justice. For if some runners had a head\nstart\u2014if there was unequal opportunity\u2014then the\nrace was unjust, and the \u201cwinner\u201d has no moral claim on\nthe medal. But if the medal is awarded purely on the basis of merit,\nand against a background of equal opportunity, then the winner\ndeserves that medal, and justice has been done.\n\nIn a meritocracy there is an \u201cequal starting line\u201d (or, to\nuse another common, athletic metaphor, a \u201clevel playing\nfield\u201d) from which people compete for scarce social goods. That\nequal starting line, when coupled with a merit-based distributive\nrule, provides a full theory of distributive justice. (For more on the\nconnection between meritocracy and equal opportunity, see Arneson 2002\n[2015], Daniels 1978, Mulligan 2018b, and Goldman 1977.)\n\nSometimes the aforementioned idea of equal opportunity is referred to\nas \u201cfair\u201d or \u201csubstantive\u201d equal opportunity,\nand the merit-based distributive rule as \u201cformal\u201d equal\nopportunity. When things are put in those terms, a meritocracy is\nsimply a society in which there is equal opportunity (fair and\nformal).\n\nWhile the equal starting line metaphor is handwavy, equal opportunity\nhas been made rigorous (see Roemer 1998). And the ideal has clear\nramifications for public policy, such as estate/inheritance taxes (so\npeople don\u2019t accrue wealth on the basis of family circumstances\ninstead of merit) and public education (so that the children of poor\nfamilies receive the same quality education as the children of the\nrich).\n\nThere are two salient debates within the equal opportunity literature\nimportant to meritocracy. The first is whether there is a moral\ndifference between (i) social advantage, like being born into\na rich family, and (ii) natural advantage\u2014like\nintelligence (important: insofar as it is genetically- rather than\nenvironmentally-derived). The meritocrat is committed to nullifying\nthe former through equal opportunity, but what about the latter?\n(Nullifying natural advantage would consist in providing extra\nresources to those who are naturally disadvantaged.)\n\nThe second debate involves the extent to which the state may interfere\nin family affairs to establish equal opportunity (see Fishkin 1983).\nEven with robust \u201cexternal\u201d measures (estate taxes, public\neducation), different families will show different degrees of care for\ntheir children. That will lead to some inequality of opportunity.\n\nIndeed, different kinds of care\u2014not just parental\nattention versus neglect\u2014may lead to inequalities of\nopportunity. One family may inculcate a love and aptitude for music in\ntheir child; another family may stress sports. The philosophical\nissues here are to explain what is problematic and what is not, and to\ndraw the line between the government\u2019s interest in establishing\nequal opportunity and the liberty of parents to raise their children\nas they see fit.\n3. Meritocratic Governance\n\nThis section and the following one are the core of this entry. They\naddress the two principal senses in which meritocracy has arisen\nwithin\n philosophy.[1]\n This section considers meritocracy as a form of government.\n\nTerminologically, these systems are referred to as \u201cpolitical\nmeritocracies\u201d in the Eastern philosophical literature and\n\u201cepistocracies\u201d in the Western literature. The latter term\nis due to David Estlund (2003) and stresses the superior\nknowledge\u2014episteme\u2014which meritocratic political\nrulers possess. This entry follows the former usage.\n\nThree broad questions face proposals for meritocratic governance. The\nfirst asks what constitutes merit or, equivalently, \u201cwho are the\nmeritocrats?\u201d The meritocratic class could consist of citizens\nwho are competent (somehow defined); who are more likely than\nothers to produce good political results (which could be different\nfrom the class of competent\n citizens\u2014\u00a72.1);\n who are best able to represent their constituents; or\nsomething else.\n\nThe second question asks, \u201chow should the meritocrats\nrule?\u201d It is not enough to show that there is a well-defined\nmeritocratic class. A particular form of government, harnessing the\nmeritocrats, must be elaborated.\n\nThe third question asks, \u201cis meritocracy justifiable?\u201d\nThat is, proponents of meritocracy must defend their system against\nthe charge that it is unfair. Discussion of these challenges is\ndelayed until\n \u00a75.\n\nWith one deontological exception (to be discussed), meritocratic\npolitical systems are justified on consequentialist grounds.\nMeritocrats claim, that is, that their systems would produce better\npolitical outcomes\u2014more justice and prosperity, say\u2014than\nprevailing political systems do.\n\nMany contemporary meritocrats are motivated by a perception that\ncontemporary democracy is dysfunctional. They adduce a range of\nempirical research: voters don\u2019t know basic political facts\n(e.g., Somin 2013); they treat politics as a sport, in which what is\nimportant is not achieving good social outcomes or even promoting\ntheir own interests but that their \u201cteam\u201d win (Lenz 2012);\nthey are afflicted by motivated reasoning, seeking out\nevidence to confirm existing beliefs and generating specious grounds\nto ignore disconfirming evidence (Flynn, Nyhan, & Reifler 2017);\nand more. (The relevant research was pioneered by Converse [1964].\nBrennan [2016] provides a contemporary survey.)\n3.1 New Confucian meritocracy\n\nIn recent years, scholars have looked to the Confucian tradition\n (\u00a71)\n to inspire and ground political theories. (See, e.g., Bai 2020; Bell\n2006 and 2015; Bell & Li 2013; Bell & Wang 2020; Chan 2014;\nand Jiang 2013. The reader may also consult recent special issues of\nCulture and Dialogue [2020, volume 8, issue 2] and\nPhilosophy & Social Criticism [2020, volume 46, issue 9],\ndevoted to New Confucian meritocracy.) Incidentally, there has been\ninsufficient interaction between the epistocracy literature and this\none. That is an intersection ripe for research.\n\nThis literature is part political theory and part comparative\npolitics. New Confucian meritocrats frequently point to China\u2019s\nstability and economic success and contrast it with contemporary\ndemocratic dysfunction. That said, it should not be thought that the\nabove-cited scholars, nor New Confucian meritocrats broadly, are\napologists for the Chinese Communist Party. They are not.\n\nThese theories incorporate some liberal democratic features while\nrejecting others, like robust freedom of speech or the \u201cone\nperson, one vote\u201d principle. All deny the truth and usefulness\nof regarding citizens as equals when it comes to voting. New Confucian\nmeritocratic theories are, thus, best understood as hybrids of\nclassical Confucianism and contemporary democratic theory.\n\nThey vary in their particulars. For example, Daniel Bell (2015),\ndrawing from an ideal informing contemporary Chinese politics, calls\nfor \u201cdemocracy at the bottom, experimentation in the middle, and\nmeritocracy at the top\u201d (2015: 9). Bell\u2019s meritocracy is\npurely political (he rejects meritocratic distribution of the\nsort discussed in\n \u00a74),\n and mainly applicable to the highest political offices. Nevertheless,\nthe political system is structured to funnel the most meritorious\ncitizens to its apex (by using, e.g., examinations for public\nofficials).\n\nTongdong Bai (2020), drawing from Mencius, endorses the\n\u201cliberal\u201d part of liberal democracy but not the democratic\npart. He argues for a government that is \u201cfor the people, of the\npeople, but not by the people\u201d (2020: 32). In Bai\u2019s hybrid\nregime, liberal features like the rule of law and human rights do not\nemerge from Western values of individuality and equality but from\nclassical Confucian values. Bai concedes that, so grounded, these\nfeatures\n\n\nmay be more contextual and less absolute than the rights derived from\nan asocial and autonomous [i.e., Western] conception of the\nindividual. (2020: 259)\n\n\nDemocracy should be rejected, according to Bai, because it is less\nlegitimate than a meritocratic alternative. Political authority\nderives from service to the people, and democracy is not doing that\nwell (because of, e.g., the aforementioned voter\nignorance/irrationality). Bai invokes a notion common among\nmeritocrats: There are real differences in virtue, intelligence, etc.\nbetween people; these differences render us appropriate for different\npositions in social and political hierarchies; and that sorting is in\nfact desirable (see also Bell & Wang 2020).\n\nThe idea that liberal features might emerge from Confucian principles\nhas been most fully explored by Joseph Chan (2014), whose\nperfectionistic theory appeals to the Confucian conception of the good\nlife. Chan describes this conception as one that\n\n\ntakes material well-being, moral self-cultivation, and virtuous social\nrelationships as constituents \u2026 with the ideal of sagehood as\nthe highest good. (2014: 44)\n\n\nChan\u2019s preferred political system is one in which this\naccount of the good life is best promoted. In his view, such a system\nwill contain both liberal features, such as human rights, and\nmeritocratic features. As regards the latter, Chan recommends a\nbicameral legislature, with one chamber chosen democratically and the\nother filled meritocratically (elite citizens selecting from a pool of\nexperienced public servants).\n\nLike Bai, Chan\u2019s affinity for liberal features, like human\nrights, is not categorical. We do not possess rights because we are\nhuman; we possess them because they are instrumentally useful in\npromoting the Confucian good life. In fact, for Chan they are ever\nmore contingent than that: They are merely a \u201cfallback\napparatus\u201d for the non-ideal circumstances we find ourselves in.\nIn ideal circumstances, in which all citizens were virtuous and able\nto resolve disputes through mediation, human rights would be\nunnecessary, even destructive.\n\nIn addition to the broad challenges that New Confucian meritocrats,\nqua meritocrats, face\n (\u00a75),\n there are detractors within the Confucian tradition. Some\n\u201cConfucian democrats\u201d argue that democratic political\nparticipation is essential for cultivating Confucian virtues (see,\ne.g., Angle 2012, Hall & Ames 1999, and Tan 2004). These virtues\ninclude humaneness (ren, \u4ec1), wisdom (zhi,\n\u667a), righteousness (yi, \u7fa9), ritual propriety\n(li, \u79ae), and integrity (xin,\n\u4fe1)\u2014the \u201cFive Constant Virtues\u201d.\n\nSungmoon Kim\u2019s (2017 and 2018) pragmatic Confucian\ndemocracy holds that democracy has instrumental power which\nmeritocracy lacks. Democracy better promotes\n\n\nlegitimacy and order acquired through an effective and sustained\ncoordination of complex social, economic, and political interactions\namong citizens who have profound moral and economic disagreement.\n(2018: 6)\n\n\nDemocracy, that is, is better able to cope with the disagreement and\nvalue-pluralism which marks contemporary political life.\n\nElena Ziliotti (forthcoming) argues on epistemic grounds: Because\nsocial well-being is an essential Confucian value, and because\ndemocracy is a better instrument toward that end than meritocracy is,\ndemocracy is more faithful to the Confucian tradition.\n3.2 Restricted suffrage\n\nA natural meritocratic approach is to limit political power to\ncitizens who are sufficiently competent. American women did not secure\na right to vote until 1920, with the passage of the Nineteenth\nAmendment to the Constitution. John Adams explains his reasoning\nwhy:\n\n\nTheir delicacy renders them unfit for practice and experience in the\ngreat businesses of life, and the hardy enterprises of war, as well as\nthe arduous cares of state. (1776)\n\n\nUnsurprisingly\u2014given its history\u2014restricted suffrage has\nfound little philosophical purchase. But it\u2019s worth remembering\nthat we continue to deprive classes of people of political power\nwithout outcry. Children, for example, cannot vote. In Adams\u2019\nwords, they \u201chave not judgment or Will of their own\u201d.\n(L\u00f3pez-Guerra [2014] argues for a full expansion of the\nsuffrage, to include children.)\n\nJason Brennan (2011) is the salient exception to philosophers\u2019\nresistance to restricted suffrage. He argues that citizens have a\nright \u201cnot to be subject to high stakes decisions made by\nincompetent and morally unreasonable people\u201d (2011: 702), and\nthat this right is violated under universal suffrage.\n\nBrennan analogizes electorates to juries: We would think a\ndefendant\u2019s rights had been violated if he were convicted by an\nignorant, irrational, or morally unreasonable jury. And since\nreal-world electorates are, according to Brennan, ignorant,\nirrational, and morally unreasonable, those affected by their\ndecisions find their rights violated.\n\nBrennan\u2019s argument is distinctive not only because it defends\nrestricted suffrage but because it gives a deontological\njustification for political meritocracy. The other justifications\nsurveyed in this section are consequentialist. While such a\njustification for restricted suffrage might be given, Brennan\u2019s\nconcern is the alleged rights-violations that universal suffrage\ninflicts.\n3.3 Plural voting\n\nPerhaps the most famous meritocratic proposal in the Western\nliterature is John Stuart Mill\u2019s (1859a, 1859b, 1861) plural\nvoting. Mill\u2019s proposal integrates his liberal desire for\nuniversal suffrage with an anti-egalitarian streak:\n\n\nIf it is asserted that all persons ought to be equal in every\ndescription of right recognised by society, I answer, not until all\nare equal in worth as human beings. It is the fact, that one person is\nnot as good as another; and it is reversing all the rules of\nrational conduct, to attempt to raise a political fabric on a\nsupposition which is at variance with fact. (1859b: 23)\n\n\n(Notice how similar this sentiment is to Mencius\u2019\n [\u00a71].)\n\nMill\u2019s proposal is simple: Everybody gets a vote (thereby\nsatisfying universal suffrage) and some people get more than one\n(because they are, in some sense, of greater \u201cworth\u201d).\nMill offers several justifications for plural voting (see Dale Miller\n2015), including\u2014unsurprisingly for the utilitarian\nMill\u2014that it will produce better political consequences.\n\nAn immediate challenge facing the plural voting proponent is how to\nspecify voting weights. Mill (1859b: 25\u201326) gives one potential\nspecification:\n\nUnskilled laborers: 1 vote\nSkilled laborers: 2 votes\nForemen and \u201csuperintendents of labor\u201d: 3 votes\nFarmers, manufacturers, and traders: 3\u20134 votes\nProfessionals (e.g., lawyers, doctors, clergymen, \u201cliterary\nmen\u201d, artists, \u201cpublic functionaries\u201d): 5\u20136\nvotes\nUniversity graduates and members of \u201clearned\nsocieties\u201d: At least as many votes as professionals.\n\n\nWhile this assignment has prima facie plausibility, Mill does\nnot provide a rigorous defense of it. It is surely sub-optimal (why 3\nvotes for foremen? Why not 2? Or 3.5?) And perhaps its prima\nfacie plausibility is misleading. Maybe professionals possess\nbiases which laborers do not, thereby making the former less likely\nthan the latter to vote well. (The same may be said of Harwood\u2019s\n[1998] proposal.)\n\nTo overcome this difficulty, Mulligan (2018c) advances a statistical\napproach to plural voting which attempts to rigorously derive optimal\nvoting weights from voting history. And Trevor Latimer\u2019s (2018)\n\u201cegalitarian\u201d plural voting proceeds in two stages: The\nfirst operates under \u201cone person, one vote\u201d and determines\nvoting weights; the second determines the substantive political\nquestion using those (generally unequal) weights.\n\nTwo technical notes: First, some forms of plural voting may de\nfacto restrict the suffrage. For example, suppose that there are\nfour voters. Voters A, B, and C have 2\nvotes each. Voter D has 1 vote. There are no voter coalitions\nin which D\u2019s vote affects the result. He is effectively\ndisenfranchised. The flip-side of this is that plural voting is\ncompatible with democrats\u2019 treasured \u201cone person, one\nvote\u201d principle: If voters are equally competent, a plural\nvoting system will grant them an equal number of votes.\n\nSecond, there is no unique assignment of voting weights. For example,\nall weights in Mill\u2019s system may be multiplied by 2, with the\nsame results.\n3.4 Limited epistocracy\n\nThe aforementioned proposals would radically change political\npractice. As such, they invite a criticism that they are\ninsufficiently democratic\n (\u00a75.3).\n This has led some philosophers to develop \u201climited\nepistocracies\u201d which would improve political performance without\nstraying too far from the democratic status quo.\n\nPerhaps, for example, we can provide extra political influence to\ncitizens who know \u201cbasic political facts\u201d (Gibbons\n2021)\u2014facts which are both politically relevant and\nuncontroversial, like candidates\u2019 policy platforms. Or perhaps\n\u201cspecialized institutions\u201d (Jeffrey 2018), like the World\nHealth Organization, can be granted unilateral\u2014but narrow or\ntemporary\u2014political power via the democratic process.\n\nThere is no obvious dividing line between democracy and political\nmeritocracy. All contemporary democracies seek to harness expertise,\nalbeit to different extents and through different processes. The U.S.\nSenate, for example, was envisioned as a \u201cportion of enlightened\ncitizens\u201d (Madison 1787: Tuesday, June 26) to serve as a bulwark\nagainst the \u201cfickleness and passion\u201d of the more\ndemocratic House of Representatives. Institutions like that plausibly\nqualify as limited epistocracies and might be defended on those\ngrounds.\n3.5 Other approaches\n\nAlthough Brennan has written in support of restricting the suffrage\n (\u00a73.2),\n his preferred form of governance is, apparently, what he calls\ngovernment by simulated oracle (see Brennan 2016):\n\n\nEvery citizen may vote. When citizens vote, they (a) indicate their\npolicy preferences or their preferred political outcomes, while (b)\nindicating their demographic information, and (c) taking a test of\nbasic political knowledge. The government then uses data sets (a),\n(b), and (c) to determine, statistically, what a fully informed\nelectorate would want, while correcting for the influence of race,\nincome, sex, and/or other demographic factors on the vote. In short,\ngovernment-by-simulated-oracle estimates what a demographically\nidentical but fully informed electorate would want,\nand then implements that instead of what the uninformed electorate in\nfact wants. (Brennan 2018: 55\u201356)\n\n\nWhat ought to count is not voters\u2019 expressed\npreferences\u2014which are affected by ignorance, irrationality, and\nthe other dysfunctions which so trouble him and other\nmeritocrats\u2014but their enlightened preferences. If I\ncast a vote for X rather than Y because I hold false\nbeliefs or am biased, then perhaps my vote should accrue to Y\nrather than X. For Y is what I would vote for, if\nnot for my ignorance or irrationality.\n\nWhile there has been significant work on enlightened preferences in\neconomics and political science (e.g., Althaus 2003, Caplan 2007, and\nGilens 2012), Brennan has not explored this system in any detail.\n(Ahlstrom-Vij [2022] does so, and thinks the system qualifies as\ndemocratic, not meritocratic.) One challenge is that it\u2019s\nunclear what is meant by demographic bias. Our political preferences\nare shaped by myriad elements of our identity, including our\ndemographics. Evangelical Protestants are much more opposed to\nabortion than adherents of other religions (Pew 2022). Is this bias of\nthe sort that must be neutralized? Or a predictable and bona\nfide consequence of a deeper ideology?\n\nA second strategy for dealing with the voter ignorance/irrationality\nproblem is distinguishing two political classes and assigning them\ndifferent roles. On the one hand there are regular citizens, who are\nresponsible for setting political goals and determining their\nsociety\u2019s values. That is done democratically. On the other\nhand, there are legislators and bureaucrats. They are responsible for\npursuing, in the manner they deem best, the ends identified by the\nregular citizens.\n\nThe ignorance/irrationality problem is thus putatively solved: While\nthe latter task requires expertise which the public does not have, the\nformer task does not. Indeed, perhaps the former task is enabled by\nthe folk wisdom which legislators/bureaucrats lack. One is reminded of\nWilliam F. Buckley\u2019s quip:\n\n\nI would rather be governed by the first 2,000 people in the telephone\ndirectory than by the Harvard University faculty. (Quoted in Meyer\n1961: 143)\n\n\nThis approach, which has come to be known as values-only\nvoting (Beerbohm 2012; Christiano 1996 & 2008), puts the\npublic and legislators/bureaucrats in a principal-agent relationship.\nFor instance, the public may decree, via the democratic process, that\nthe economy ought to be more equal. That goal is adopted by the\nlegislators/bureaucrats, who choose and implement the policies which,\nin their superior judgment, will best promote it. In doing so, they\ncan avoid pitfalls which the general public might not, like levying a\nluxury tax whose burden falls on workers.\n\nAs with Brennan\u2019s government by simulated oracle, there is a\ndividing line problem here: What counts as an end and what counts as a\nmeans and can they be distinguished? Dimitri Landa and Ryan Pevnick\ngive the example of a public that seeks to \u201cminimize the\ninnocent loss of life\u201d (2020: 10). In response, legislators\ndutifully ban guns and abortion. It seems like a large portion of the\npublic would be dissatisfied with how \u201cits vision\u201d was\ncarried out. Landa and Pevnick also point out that under values-only\nvoting, citizens may be unable to exert sufficient oversight\u2014an\nexample of a principal/agent problem which may afflict this\ndivision of labor.\n\nAnother proposal, most fully explored by Claudio L\u00f3pez-Guerra\n(2011, 2014, 2020), uses lotteries to reduce political influence from\nthe public broadly to a proper subset of it (see also Guerrero 2014;\nLandemore 2020; and Saunders 2010 & 2012). In\nL\u00f3pez-Guerra\u2019s envisioned system (which he does not\nunreservedly endorse and which, he says, qualifies as democratic),\nthere is universal suffrage in the sense that virtually all citizens\nare eligible to vote. But for any given election, not all do.\nSome citizens are chosen at random to participate. The rest are\ndisenfranchised (for that election). The chosen citizens engage in an\n\u201cexhaustive informative program designed to acquaint them with\nthe alternatives regarding the ballot\u201d (L\u00f3pez-Guerra\n2011: 212). Then they cast their votes. That program ensures that all\ncitizens who actually exercise political influence are\nwell-informed.\n\nIn this way, all citizens are potential meritocrats, and the\nmeritocratic class\u2014which changes from election to\nelection\u2014is determined purely at random. All citizens,\nregardless of intelligence, race, age, etc. have an equal chance to\nexercise political influence.\n\nA potential problem is the loss of aggregative power when the\nelectorate is reduced in this way. The primary justification for this\nsystem is epistemic quality: We would get better political outcomes\nunder it, according to L\u00f3pez-Guerra, relative to the democratic\nstatus quo. But one important argument in favor of the status quo\n (\u00a75.3)\n is that a large group of relatively incompetent voters may outperform\na small group of relatively competent voters. Under\nL\u00f3pez-Guerra\u2019s system, the electorate is smaller but\ncompetence is higher. Absent modeling it is unclear how it would\nperform relative to democracy.\n4. Meritocratic Justice\n\nIn its second sense, meritocracy is a theory of justice. It is a\ncompetitor to egalitarianism (in its various forms\u2014strict, luck,\nRawlsian, etc.), utilitarianism, libertarianism, and the other\ntheories of justice. A meritocrat in this sense is someone who\nbelieves that a just state is a meritocracy.\n\nLittle work has been done on the relationship between\nmeritocracy\u2019s two senses\u2014an approach to governance and a\ntheory of justice (although see Mulligan 2022)\u2014and it is unclear\nwhat, if any, connection there is between them. It certainly seems\ncoherent to believe (e.g.) both (i) social goods should be distributed\non the basis of merit and (ii) we should have a democratic, not a\nmeritocratic, approach to politics.\n\nNow, theories of justice across the aforementioned traditions may\ntentatively endorse meritocratic principles. For these principles may\nbe instrumentally useful in promoting their preferred ideal of\njustice. For example, it is plausible that merit-based hiring\n (\u00a74.2)\n promotes the general welfare, to some extent. Thus, a utilitarian may\nendorse meritocracy of that sort, instrumentally.\n\nAs Adam Swift and Gordon Marshall put this view,\n\n\na meritocratic allocation of individuals to occupations can be\njustified on the grounds that a society in which people are doing what\nthey are best able to do will be optimally productive, but a\nmeritocratic allocation of rewards to individuals can not be justified\non the grounds that such an allocation gives people what they deserve.\n(1997: 44)\n\n\n(See also Daniels 1978.)\n\nThis is certainly a defensible view of meritocracy\u2019s allure, and\nit appears to be backed up empirically. As Roland B\u00e9nabou puts\nit,\n\n\nthe analysis generally validates the common intuition that\nmeritocracy, appropriately defined, is desirable \u2026 on grounds\nof efficiency. (2000: 319)\n\n\nBut this instrumental connection between merit and good consequences\nis contingent\n (\u00a72.1).\n The most vocal proponents of meritocracy hold that there is a\ndeontological requirement to distribute on the basis of\n merit.[2]\n And so any good consequences are, at best, a happy side-effect of\nadherence to a moral rule. But why does such a requirement exist?\n4.1 Justification\n\nWhile not endorsing it, Swift and Marshall previewed the principal\nanswer to that question: In a meritocracy, people get what they\ndeserve. And because, it is argued, justice is giving people what they\ndeserve, meritocracy is just. Meritocrats thus follow in the\nAristotelian tradition\n (\u00a71)\n of seeking to match social goods, like jobs and income, with facts\nabout the people who desire them, like their qualifications or\neconomic contributions.\n\nLike desert-based approaches to justice broadly, meritocracy has not\nbeen popular within contemporary philosophy. But there have been\ndefenders. David Miller (1999) gives \u201ctwo cheers\u201d to the\n ideal.[3]\n This qualification is rooted in Miller\u2019s pluralistic\nview of justice. He identifies three \u201cmodes of human\ninteraction\u201d, with desert (meritocracy) governing one of them\n(viz. \u201cinstrumental association\u201d). (Principles of\nequality and need govern the other two.)\n\nMiller appeals to Aristotelian proportional equality\n (\u00a71)\n to ground the desertist portion of his theory. Understanding\n\u201cmerit\u201d as social contribution, he argues that a just\nsociety rewards people in proportion to their contributions (or, in\nthe case of jobs, the qualities that will enable them to make\ncontributions).\n\n\nHiring by merit is the policy that in general brings about the closest\ncorrespondence between individuals\u2019 contributions and their\nrewards\u2026. Nepotism or discrimination is unfair because it\npredictably creates a state of affairs in which there is a discrepancy\nbetween deserts and income rewards. Moreover, the best-qualified\ncandidate who is passed over can legitimately complain that she is the\nvictim of an injustice through being prevented from earning rewards\ncommensurate with her potential contribution. (Miller 1999: 166)\n\n\nMulligan\u2019s (2018b) meritocratic theory of justice is, in\ncontrast to Miller\u2019s, monistic. That is, Mulligan\nclaims that justice is a matter of desert, and only a matter of\ndesert. And doing justice to people\u2014giving them what they\ndeserve\u2014is about establishing equal opportunity and judging them\non their merits alone.\n\nMulligan advances several justifications for meritocracy, but most\nsalient is meritocracy\u2019s intuitive appeal. People feel\nthat meritocratic distribution is just, and this sentiment appears\nstable across race, gender, socioeconomic class, political persuasion,\nand culture (cf.\n \u00a76).\n The research adduced comes from equity theory\n (\u00a71),\n experimental economics (e.g., Alm\u00e5s, Cappelen, & Tungodden\n2020; Cappelen, S\u00f8rensen, & Tungodden 2010; Frohlich,\nOppenheimer, & Kurki 2004), the child development literature\n(Baumard, Mascaro, & Chevallier 2012; Kanngiesser & Warneken\n2012; Sloane, Baillargeon, & Premack 2014), evolutionary\npsychology (Aar\u00f8e & Petersen 2014; Baumard, Andr\u00e9,\n& Sperber 2013; Petersen 2012), neuroeconomics (Cappelen, Eichele,\net al. 2014; Vostroknutov, Tobler, & Rustichini 2012), and other\nfields of empirical study.\n\nOther justifications for meritocratic norms have been given,\nindependent of comprehensive theories of justice. George Sher (1987)\ngives one which is grounded in autonomy (sometimes put in\nterms of respect or dignity). When we distribute a\nscarce good on the basis of merit, we appeal only to attributes which\nconstitute persons, and in particular those persons who are competing\nfor the good. These attributes include skills, talents, and\npreferences. Meritocratic distribution thus provides people maximal\ncontrol over their lives (or shows them maximal respect/dignity).\n\n\nWhen we hire by merit, we abstract from all facts about the applicants\nexcept their ability to perform well at the relevant tasks\u2026. We\ntreat them as agents whose purposeful acts can make a difference in\nthe world\u2026. Selecting by merit is a way of taking seriously the\npotential agency of both the successful and the unsuccessful\napplicants. (Sher 1987: 121)\n\n\n(See also Mason 2006 and Varga 2016. Dobos 2016 provides an overview\nof justifications for merit-based hiring.)\n\nAnother idea is that the social good itself\u2014its very\nnature\u2014points to merit as the morally proper basis for\ndistribution. This Aristotelian notion\n (\u00a71)\n is today more commonly put in terms of \u201cfittingness\u201d or\n\u201crelevant qualifications\u201d.\n\nThe idea may be elaborated in conceptual terms (see Sher 1987 and\nWilliams 1973). It is morally fitting to give the job at the widget\nfactory to the applicant who is best at making widgets, a fact which\nmay be discerned from the concept of widget-making (cf. Williams:\n\u201cThe proper ground of distribution of medical care is ill\nhealth: this is a necessary truth\u201d [1973: 240]).\n\nPut differently, there is a conceptual connection between social goods\nand merit. There is no such connection between social goods and the\nother commonly-cited grounds for distribution, such as maximizing\nproductivity or treating people equally. While in those cases\nconnections doubtless exist and may seem weighty, they are external.\nThey do not participate in our understanding of the social good\nitself.\n\nThe fittingness of merit-based distribution might be regarded as\nprimitive and thus neither in need of nor amenable to further\njustification. As Joel Feinberg puts it,\n\n\nI am not sure how, if at all, these judgments of moral appropriateness\nare to be verified; but I suspect that they resemble certain aesthetic\njudgments\u2014for example that crimson and orange are clashing\ncolors. (1963: 92)\n\n4.2 The meritocratic distribution of jobs\n\nMeritocratic hiring is often described using the language of\ndiscrimination. It is unjust, according the meritocrat, to\ndiscriminate against applicants for a job on any ground other than\nmerit:\n\n\nAccording to a widely held view, when there are a number of applicants\nfor an available job, justice demands that the job be offered to the\nbest-qualified applicant. We express this by saying that \u2026 the\nprinciple involved is one of hiring by merit. This is the principle\nthat condemns discrimination on grounds of sex, race, or religion when\nhiring employees, as well, of course, as good old-fashioned nepotism.\n(David Miller 1999: 156)\n\n\nThis is the moral principle seemingly at work (as Schmidtz [2006]\npoints out) in Martin Luther King, Jr.\u2019s famous \u201cI Have a\nDream\u201d speech, in which King yearns that his children \u201cnot\nbe judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their\ncharacter\u201d. For the meritocrat, racial discrimination is morally\nwrong because all non-merit-based discrimination is\nwrong.\n\nThe principle has been operationalized. In \u201cblind\nauditions\u201d, pioneered by symphony orchestras, applicants play\nbehind screens so that the jury cannot discover their race, sex,\nappearance, etc. and can only assess the quality of the\nperformance.\n\nIn the United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was defended, in\npart, on meritocratic grounds (see Kershnar 2003). The Act prohibits\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin,\nand sex. (The U.S. Supreme Court later decided\u2014in Bostock v.\nClayton County\u2014that discrimination on the basis of sexual\norientation and gender identity runs afoul of the Act\u2019s\ninjunction against sex-based discrimination, and so is illegal.)\n\nLacking a theory of merit\n (\u00a72.1),\n it is not always clear which features of applicants count as merits\nand which do not. In toy cases\u2014say, hiring a new\nbricklayer\u2014things are simple. A bricklayer must be\nstrong, reliable, precise in his work, and\nso on. Race, gender, and appearance are obviously irrelevant to\nbricklaying.\n\nIn the real world, things are murkier. One example of this is\n\u201creaction qualifications\u201d (Wertheimer 1983). These are\n\n\nqualifications that count as such because of the reactions of\nrecipients, where the recipients are those with whom the successful\ncandidate will interact as a result of filling the relevant position.\n(Mason 2017:\n 49)[4]\n\n\nThe taste discrimination case considered in\n \u00a72.1\n involves a reaction qualification which is not a bona fide\nmerit. Racist customers may react positively to a saleswoman of their\npreferred race. But her race is not a merit. On the other hand,\ncustomers will buy more widgets from a saleswoman who is\npersonable, and that is a merit.\n\nBetween these there are difficult cases. Suppose the saleswoman is\nbeautiful, and her beauty entices customers to buy from her\nwhen they otherwise would not. Is beauty a merit in the context of\nselling widgets? In the context of modeling? Working at McDonalds? Is\nbeing a woman a merit in the context of gynecology (because many women\nwould prefer a female doctor)? A satisfying conceptual analysis of\nmerit would distinguish meritocratic reaction qualifications from\nnon-meritocratic reaction qualifications.\n\nA salient and philosophically interesting issue is affirmative action.\nSome forms of affirmative action do not appear to conflict with\nmeritocratic hiring. For example, making special efforts to solicit\napplicants from historically underrepresented groups and then judging\nthose applicants (along with everyone else) on the basis of merit\nseems compatible.\n\nBut the crux of affirmative action\u2014quotas and preferential\ntreatment\u2014is incompatible with meritocratic hiring. As Robert\nFullinwider (2002 [2018]) says, \u201cthe aims of real world\naffirmative action make race and ethnicity (and sometimes gender)\nsalient, not personal desert or merit\u201d. (See also Nagel\n1973.)\n\nAffirmative action thus helpfully puts the question to meritocratic\njustice. For some, affirmative action\u2019s incompatibility with\nmeritocracy reveals that affirmative action is unjust. For others,\nthis incompatibility is evidence that meritocracy is an erroneous view\nof justice.\n\nThree notes on this. First, meritocrats\u2019 resistance to\naffirmative action should be viewed in light of their commitment to\nequal opportunity\n (\u00a72.3).\n Their argument is not that there are no racial injustices, but that\nthe proper remedy is bolstering equal opportunity rather than quotas /\npreferential treatment.\n\nSecond, affirmative action again illustrates the cleavage between\nmerit and consequences. It might be the case that hiring on the basis\nof race or gender produces better consequences, owing to, for\ninstance, the benefits of a diverse workforce. For the meritocrat,\nthat is irrelevant\u2014it remains unjust, because\ndiscriminatory.\n\nThird, all that said, meritocratic hiring and affirmative action are\nnot necessarily incompatible. Suppose, for example, that there exists\n\u201cimplicit bias\u201d against some group\u2014that is,\nselectors unconsciously regard members of that group as less\nmeritorious than they actually are. If so, then by showing\n\u201cpreference\u201d to members of this group, selectors would\nmerely nullify the bias and ensure that every candidate is judged on\nhis merits. Obviously, whether implicit bias exists is an empirical\nissue. As of now, it is a hotly debated one (see, e.g., Jussim et al.\nforthcoming).\n4.3 The meritocratic distribution of income\n\nMeritocrats most commonly hold that economies ought to compensate\npeople on the basis of their\n contributions.[5]\n That is, when it comes to the distribution of income (and thus\nwealth, being merely a stock of unspent income), \u201cmerit\u201d\nshould be interpreted as economic contribution. (For discussion of the\nmatters arising in this section, see Dekker 2010, Hsieh 2000, Mankiw\n2010, David Miller 1989 and 1999, Mulligan 2018b, Riley 1989, Sheffrin\n2013, Von Platz 2022, and Weinstein 2011.)\n\nImagine a garden which produces a harvest (the \u201coutput\u201d)\nas a result of citizens\u2019 contributions to it\u2014seeding,\nwatering, weeding, fertilizing, and so on (\u201cinputs\u201d). The\nmeritocrat holds that each citizen deserves a share of the harvest\nproportional to her contribution to it. If Lane contributes twice as\nmuch during the growing season as Rory, then Lane deserves twice as\nmuch in return. (This is, again, Aristotle\u2019s notion of\nproportional equality.)\n\nBefore we examine this metaphor\u2014its complexities and whether it\nis apposite in the first place\u2014it is worth noting that this\ndistributive principle is idiosyncratic, politically. To many, the\nidea that people who contribute more should be paid more, an obviously\ninegalitarian idea, sounds conservative. And it has been defended by\nconservatives (e.g., Mankiw [2013]).\n\nYet this is at the very same time the rule favored by Marx (in\n\u201cCritique of the Gotha Program\u201d) for his penultimate,\nsocialist phase of history. This is, in part, why it is fair to say\nthat \u201cMarx is more a meritocrat than Rawls, Nielsen, Dworkin,\nand most contemporary liberal political philosophers\u201d (Pojman\n1999: 93).\n\nAn obvious question for this distributive view is how to interpret\n\u201ccontribution\u201d. For some scholars, the proper index is\nwillingness-to-pay (WTP)\u2014the maximum price a person\nwill pay for some good or service. Thus, if a person P\nproduces X, by aggregating the WTP for X across\nconsumers we obtain a measure of P\u2019s contribution.\n\nA slightly different interpretation relies on the concept of\nconsumer surplus. Observe that if a consumer pays exactly her\nWTP for X, in a sense she has received no benefit. For at\nthat price she is, by definition, indifferent between buying\nX and saving her money. Whereas, if there is a large\ndifference between her WTP and X\u2019s price, then her\nwelfare (as measured in dollars) increases when she buys\n X.[6]\n That increase is the consumer surplus.\n\nThe typical person\u2019s WTP for a diamond ring is high and WTP for\na jug of water is low. But plausibly the producer of the latter\ncontributes more than the producer of the former.\n\nStandard (neoclassical) economic theory also provides an\ninterpretation of contribution, as marginal product. This is\nthe change in economic output a person\u2019s economic participation\ncreates, holding all else fixed. In simple models, this in fact is how\neconomies remunerate. In these models, compensation equals\ncontribution.\n\nStill, it is important that compensation be proportional to\ncontribution, since, in general, total output will not equal the sum\nof marginal products. (It\u2019s true only for the special case of\nconstant returns to scale.) But in all cases, proportional\ncompensation is possible.\n\nAll of these interpretations of \u201ccontribution\u201d rely on the\nstandard idea that economic value is subjective\u2014that\ngoods and services are valuable because, and only insofar as, they are\ndesired by consumers. That might be disputed. Perhaps producers of\nfirearms and social media make no contribution at all or indeed are\ndestructive. That possibility is not captured in any of the\naforementioned interpretations, and would require elaboration by a\nmeritocrat so inclined.\n\nAnother question is how to disentangle individuals\u2019\ncontributions from the collective economic effort. In particular,\npeople\u2019s contributions emanate not only from their labor, but\nfrom capital as well.\n\nSuppose a worker produces 100 widgets per day in a factory. On his\nown, the worker could produce nothing. Without workers, the factory\nwould sit idle. How many of those 100 widgets reflects the\nworker\u2019s contribution? How many reflect the contribution of the\ncapitalist who owns the factory?\n\nThis entanglement problem speaks to the essential role that\nequal opportunity plays in a meritocracy. If the capitalist inherited\nthe factory from his father, it is hard to see why he should be\nrewarded on meritocratic grounds. His contributions do not reflect\nhis merit. If, in contrast, the capitalist bought the factory\nhimself, with money he earned via his economic contributions,\nthat seems meritocratic.\n\nAn issue which has arisen in the literature, which is empirical rather\nthan philosophical, is how well actual economies approximate this\nmeritocratic ideal. One important way they do not is the presence of\neconomic rent (see Lamont 1997 and Mulligan 2018a).\n\nClassically, economic rents were payments for \u201cfree gifts of\nnature\u201d, like unimproved land. Imagine a wild orchard controlled\nby O, who charges people for the right to harvest it. That\nportion of O\u2019s income is economic rent. The orchard\nmakes its contribution\u2014bears fruit\u2014whether O\nreceives an income or not. This is obviously different from typical\ncompensation, which is necessary to bring factors of production into\nuse. If you want a person to make widgets, you have to pay him.\nEconomic rents are, thus, payments to a person unrelated to his\neconomic contribution. And unlike typical forms of income, economic\nrents can be taxed without loss of economic efficiency.\n\nIn contemporary economies, economic rents are diverse. They include\nincome that (i) executives receive by gaining control over their own\npay-setting (see, e.g., Bebchuk & Fried 2004); (ii) is obtained\nthrough luck (Bertrand & Mullainathan 2001); (iii) is connected to\nunproductive activity (think: hedge funds that exploit technical\ninefficiencies in markets, Bivens & Mishel 2013); and (iv)\nattractive people make because they are attractive\u2014the\nbeauty premium (Hamermesh & Biddle 1994).\n\nTypically, when economists and philosophers object to economic\nrent it is on the grounds that it is inefficient. For the\nmeritocrat, it is worse than that: It is unjust.\n\nThe most famous opponent of economic rent is Henry George, who states\nhis opposition in recognizably meritocratic terms:\n\n\nWhen all rent is taken by taxation for the needs of the community,\nthen will the equality ordained by nature be achieved. No citizen will\nhave an advantage over any other citizen save as is given by his\nindustry, skill, and intelligence; and each will obtain what he fairly\nearns. Then, but not till then, will labour get its full reward, and\ncapital its natural return. (1879: book VIII, chapter III, last\nparagraph)\n\n\nOne might wonder: Just how unequal would a meritocracy be? While the\nprecise distribution of jobs, income, and wealth will depend on the\nparticulars of the meritocratic theory, meritocracy would be\negalitarian by contemporary standards. Observe that, in a meritocracy,\ndifferences in merit may arise in only two ways: differences in\nnatural traits and differences in individual choice (about which\nskills to develop, what career to pursue, how much to work, etc.) (A\nmeritocrat could even hold that equal opportunity requires nullifying\ndifferences in natural\n traits\u2014\u00a72.3\u2014leaving\n individual choice as the sole source of inequality.)\n\nIn addition, in a meritocracy there is little to no inheritance of\nwealth. This is for the same reason that there is no inheritance of\nhereditary titles and their concomitant privileges: It violates equal\nopportunity. Inherited wealth also severs the critical connection\nbetween contribution and income. If one doesn\u2019t deserve some\nwealth\u2014which one doesn\u2019t, if it\u2019s\ninherited\u2014then one doesn\u2019t deserve the investment income\nit produces.\n\nFurther, the largest divergences between contribution and income are\nseen at the top of the distribution. Economic rents, for instance, are\nextracted by the very rich. Meritocratic policies to remedy the\nproblem of rent have the effect of redistributing wealth from the top\nof the distribution downward.\n5. Objections\n\nAll philosophical theories garner objections. Meritocracy is unusual\nin that its critics come from all over: egalitarians and libertarians;\nliberals and conservatives; leftists and reactionaries.\n5.1 Rawls\n\nIn A Theory of Justice, Rawls assures his readers that his\ntheory would not produce a meritocratic society. That is not to say\nthat there is no common ground between Rawls and meritocrats. Both\nagree that equal opportunity is an essential element of a just\n society.[7]\n But Rawls pairs equal opportunity not with a meritocratic\ndistributive rule, but with his Difference Principle. A just\nsociety, according to Rawls, will respond to merit only insofar as\nthat benefits the worst-off members of society. Conceivably, by\nallowing meritorious citizens to earn more than non-meritorious\ncitizens, we can grow the social pie and thereby enable greater\nredistribution to the worst-off. If that is the case, and only if that\nis the case, will Rawls\u2019 theory pay any heed to merit. But\nmerit\u2019s role in Rawlsian distribution will always be mild,\ninstrumental, and contingent.\n\nRawls has four other objections to meritocracy. The first targets\ndesert-based theories of justice broadly. Rawls claims that no one\ndeserves anything because all bases for desert originate in\n\u201cfortunate family or social circumstances\u201d. A person is\nintelligent, for instance, either because she has a naturally high IQ\nor because she was raised in an environment that cultivated that\ntrait. Either way, that kind of \u201cfortune\u201d undermines\ndesert-based distribution. (Marx makes a similar argument in\n\u201cCritique of the Gotha Program\u201d.)\n\nSecond, Rawls regards meritocracy as unworkable. It may just be\npractically impossible to track people\u2019s merits in sufficient\ndetail to enable merit-based distribution.\n\nThird, perhaps meritocracy is only justified by \u201ccomprehensive\ndoctrines\u201d, and does not emerge from free and equal people in a\nsystem of cooperation (Rawls 1993). If that is so (and if Rawlsian\npublic reason is sound), then that is a problem. But Margaret Holmgren\n(1986) and James Sterba (1974) argue that Rawlsian contractors would\nin fact choose a desert-based system of justice, like meritocracy.\n\nFourth, Rawls says that meritocracy is insufficiently democratic. This\nis interesting because later in A Theory of Justice he\nsuggests an openness to meritocratic governance:\n\n\nNow the ship of state is in some ways analogous to a ship at sea; and\nto the extent that this is so, the political liberties are indeed\nsubordinate to the other freedoms that, so to say, define the\nintrinsic good of the passengers. Admitting these assumptions, plural\nvoting may be perfectly just. (1971: 233)\n\n5.2 Relational egalitarianism\n\nBy definition, egalitarians regard the ideal of equality as\nmorally salient. Meritocrats, on the other hand, regard equality as\nirrelevant or even inimical to justice. (Unless we are talking about\nAristotelian proportional equality.)\n\nOne important class of equality-based objections to meritocracy comes\nfrom relational egalitarians like Elizabeth Anderson (1999)\nand Harry Brighouse (1996), who argue that it is morally important\nthat people be able to relate to each other as equals. That seems\nthreatened in a meritocracy, in which differences in merit create\ndifferences in political power, social goods, or both. How could an\nunmeritorious person regard a meritorious person as an equal,\nespecially when the latter is wealthier, or has more votes, than the\nformer? Mightn\u2019t there be problems of oppression,\ndomination, and hierarchy in a meritocracy?\nDon\u2019t meritocrats even celebrate hierarchies?\n\nRelational egalitarianism is used to defend democratic political\narrangements. Brighouse, for example, advances the \u201cequal\navailability of political influence [EAPI]\u201d, which includes the\n\u201cone person, one vote\u201d principle:\n\n\nThe argument for EAPI is that guaranteeing that equal influence will\nbe available to them over our collective circumstances is a requisite\nof expressing respect for our fellow citizens. (1996: 123)\n\n\nThus for Brighouse, a meritocratic political arrangement (that, e.g.,\nviolated \u201cone person, one vote\u201d) would obstruct\ncitizens\u2019 mutual respect, and therefore be morally unacceptable.\nAnalogous objections to meritocracy would be lodged by other\nrelational egalitarians, with specifics depending on the particular\nrelational egalitarian theory.\n5.3 Democratic theory\n\nUnsurprisingly, democrats object to meritocratic politics. There are\nthree main classes of objection.\n\nFor epistemic democrats (e.g., Goodin & Spiekermann\n[2018] and Landemore [2012]), democracy is valuable and legitimate\nbecause of its ability to make correct (e.g., just) decisions. They\neither resist meritocrats\u2019 claims\n (\u00a73)\n about the ignorance and irrationality of the democratic voter or,\nmore commonly, reject the inference from individual dysfunction to\ncollective dysfunction. This is the most direct objection to\nmeritocracy given that nearly all arguments for meritocratic\ngovernance are epistemic in character.\n\nThe most commonly-adduced argument for the \u201cwisdom of the\n[democratic] crowd\u201d is Condorcet\u2019s Jury Theorem\n(Condorcet 1785). In its simplest form, the theorem considers a group\nof voters choosing between two alternatives (e.g., a Democrat and a\nRepublican). Each voter has a probability of choosing the\n\u201ccorrect\u201d (e.g., more just) candidate. That probability is\nshared and >50%. Assuming votes are statistically independent and\nthe group uses \u201cone person, one vote\u201d, Condorcet\u2019s\ntheorem tells us that (i) the larger the group gets, the more likely\nit is to choose correctly and (ii) the probability that the group\nchooses correctly goes to 100% as the number of voters goes to\ninfinity.\n\nThe meritocrat may avail himself of three broad rejoinders here.\nFirst, he may deny the relevance of the model on the grounds that its\nassumptions are violated in the real world. (Statistical independence\nis particularly troublesome given the many ways voters interact.)\nSecond, he may concede that the collective performance of democracy is\ngood for Condorcetian reasons, but insist that meritocracy does\nbetter. For it too may enjoy benefits from aggregation. Third, he may\nreply that the theorem itself commends unequal political influence:\nWhen some citizens are more competent than others, \u201cone person,\none vote\u201d is (generally) suboptimal. The group does better if\nmore competent voters are given more influence (see, e.g., Nitzan\n& Paroush 1985).\n\nEpistemic democrats have drawn on other theoretical grounds. Perhaps\n\u201cdiversity trumps ability\u201d (Hong & Page 2004):\nDemocracy effectively harnesses diversity within contemporary\nelectorates, and thereby does better, epistemically, than meritocracy\ndoes. Or perhaps while democratic voters do frequently err, as\nmeritocrats claim, those errors cancel out to allow an accurate\nminority to prevail\u2014the \u201cmiracle of aggregation\u201d\n(Surowiecki 2004).\n\nProcedural democrats take a different tact. For them, what\njustifies democracy and rules out meritocracy is adherence to certain\nmorally necessary procedures. For (pure) proceduralists, whether\nmeritocracy \u201ctracks the truth\u201d or makes decisions better\nthan democracy does is irrelevant (if indeed these notions make sense\nat all).\n\nIf, for example, some voting procedure\u2014like \u201cone person,\none vote\u201d\u2014is required by justice, and democracy embodies\nthis procedure while meritocracy rejects it, no further analysis is\nnecessary: Democracy is justified and meritocracy is not. Many\nrelational egalitarian arguments\n (\u00a75.2)\n are proceduralist, and other kinds of proceduralist theories have\nbeen developed (see, e.g., Habermas 1992 [1996] and Waldron 1999).\n\nFinally, Estlund (2008) has advanced an influential objection which is\na hybrid of the epistemic and proceduralist\napproaches\u2014epistemic proceduralism. Estlund argues\nagainst pure proceduralist approaches on the grounds that if\nprocedural fairness were all we cared about, democracy would be no\nbetter than simply flipping a coin. In both cases, all citizens have\nan equal chance of affecting an election (because, in the latter case,\nnone has any chance at all). So there must be an epistemic component\nto political justification.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that some meritocratic system might do\nbetter than democracy is insufficient to justify it. Our political\nsystem, Estlund argues, must be \u201cgenerally acceptable\u201d to\nall reasonable citizens (i.e., this is a public reason argument).\nAccording to Estlund, of all the generally acceptable systems,\ndemocracy does best.\n5.4 Libertarianism\n\nThe conflict between meritocracy and libertarianism is most obvious\nwhen one considers right-libertarian theories, like Robert\nNozick\u2019s (1974). But conflict exists, too, for left-libertarian\ntheories that have some common ground with meritocracy, like an\naffinity for equal opportunity (e.g., Otsuka\u2019s [2003]). (For a\nfull discussion, see Mulligan 2018d.)\n\nTo begin with, the meritocrat\u2019s distributive rule\u2014hire,\ncompensate, etc. on the basis of merit\u2014violates a libertarian\nright to contract. For libertarians, business owners are free to hire\nwhomever they want. They are not obligated to hire the most\nmeritorious applicant. An owner may wish to hire on the basis of race,\nor gender, or with an eye toward maximizing profits. She may wish to\nhire a friend or family member. So long as owner and employee enter\ninto their contract freely (and without fraud and the other typical\ncaveats), libertarian justice is done.\n\nA meritocratic government may enforce an alignment between\ncontribution and compensation. But that requires government\ninterventions into market exchanges which are unacceptable to the\nlibertarian. These interventions could include, for example, high top\nmarginal income tax rates and limits on executive compensation in\norder to disincentivize economic rent\n (\u00a74.3).\n\nMost libertarians also reject equal opportunity, and certainly the\ndemanding form required under meritocracy. In a meritocracy, extensive\nredistribution enables (among other things) education and healthcare\nfor the children of the poor. Coercive taxation is part and parcel of\nredistribution. Equal opportunity may also require that the government\nconfiscate and redistribute estates. All of this is problematic from\nthe libertarian perspective. (Although see Bird-Pollan 2013 and Braun\n2010 for arguments that libertarianism is compatible with estate\ntaxes.)\n\nFriedrich Hayek (1960) explicitly criticizes merit-based distribution.\nHe gives two arguments. First, he correctly observes that a\nmeritocratic economy may not be optimally efficient.\n\n\nWe do not wish people to earn a maximum of merit but to achieve a\nmaximum of usefulness at a minimum of pain and sacrifice and therefore\na minimum of merit. (1960: 96)\n\n\nHayek\u2019s point is that one way to distribute (the right way, to\nhis mind) is with an eye toward maximizing the economic surplus;\nanother way is to distribute on the basis of merit. This objection\ndoes not rest in a Nozickian freedom of contract but in\nlibertarianism\u2019s classical liberal tradition, which typically\nappeals to the consequentialist benefits of free markets.\n\nSecond, Hayek objects to the idea of a \u201cmerit czar\u201d who\nwould monitor market activity and intervene to enforce merit-based\ndistribution. That would be tyrannical. However (as Schmidtz &\nBoettke [2012 [2021]]) point out), this is not a normative objection\nto meritocracy but an objection to central planning. Indeed,\nHayek\u2019s argument can be turned around: Perhaps we should prefer\nmarket economies to central planning on the grounds that the former\ndoes a better job than the latter at recognizing merit.\n\nOne final objection, sometimes attributed to Hayek, is that\nmeritocracy is heartless. In the actual world, the objection goes,\n\u201closers\u201d can somewhat justifiably attribute their\ncondition to having grown up poor or to external factors, like racial\ndiscrimination. Those are psychologically useful excuses. But in a\nmeritocracy, in which there is equal opportunity and people are judged\non their merits, those excuses are unavailable.\n5.5 Other objections\n\nMeritocracy promises efficiency benefits and other good consequences,\nbut only contingently. Meritocracy is not a utilitarian theory, and\nfocused utilitarian objections have been lodged against it (see, e.g.,\nDurlauf 2008).\n\nMeritocracy strikes some as insufficiently attentive to the needs of\nthe poorest citizens; it is not a prioritarian theory (Wilson 2003).\n(Although if the poor are underpaid given their merit, and the rich\nare overpaid, as many meritocrats claim, then meritocracy will do\nbetter than the status quo from the prioritarian point-of-view.\nMeritocratic equal opportunity will also have an enormous effect.)\nRichard Arneson (1999) rejects Rawls\u2019s Fair Equality of\nOpportunity\n (\u00a75.1)\n as an unacceptable \u201ccompromise with meritocracy\u201d because\nit constrains the prioritarian Difference Principle.\n\nSome scholars make what is essentially an empirical argument, denying\nthe existence of an elite class of citizens on which meritocratic\ngovernance can rely (Gunn 2019; Hannon 2022; Mend\u00e9z 2022; Reiss\n2019). If the \u201cmeritocrats\u201d are not more knowledgeable\nthan common people, or if they suffer from unique and damaging biases,\nthen, whatever its theoretical virtues, meritocracy cannot be\noperationalized.\n6. The Public Debate\n\nThere\u2019s been a flurry of recent, public-facing work on\nmeritocracy. This work addresses meritocracy as a theory of justice\n (\u00a74),\n and is largely critical (e.g., Carneval et al. 2020; Littler 2018;\nMandler 2020; Markovits 2019; and Sandel 2020).\n\nThe public debate tends to be convoluted for two reasons. First,\ncommentators often fail to make clear what they mean by\n\u201cmeritocracy\u201d. The meritocratic ideal is more or less\ncompelling depending on how it is defined (e.g., with robust equal\nopportunity or without). To avoid talking past each other, it is\ncritical that commentators have a common definition in mind.\n\nSecond, one sees the classic conflation of the normative and the\npositive. This entry is concerned with the normative question:\nOught we live in a meritocracy? (Or, almost equivalently, is\nmeritocracy just?)\n\nBut then there is the positive question: Is the world\nmeritocratic? Do people enjoy equal opportunity? All else equal, do\npoor children and rich children face equal prospects? Are jobs and\nincome being distributed on the basis of merit? Or are\nnon-meritocratic features\u2014race, gender, family connections,\nappearance, luck, and so on\u2014playing roles as well?\n\nIt is useful to partition commentators on meritocracy along the\nnormative/positive dimensions. Some commentators (e.g., Mankiw [2013])\nbelieve that meritocracy is both desirable and largely realized in the\nactual world. Others (Mulligan [2018b]) think that meritocracy is\ndesirable but that we do not live in one. Still others (Markovits\n[2019]) say that we live in a meritocracy and that this is a bad\nthing. Finally, there are some (Gheaus [2015]) who think that\nmeritocracy is neither achieved nor a worthy ideal in the first\nplace.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the way perceptions of merit affect\nthe public\u2019s normative evaluation of policy. Consider\naffirmative action. While divisive, many supporters of affirmative\naction and many opponents appear to agree morally: Both want the most\nmeritorious applicant to be hired. What they disagree about is whether\naffirmative action contributes to or detracts from this shared goal.\nSupporters think that affirmative action nullifies racial bias and\nother forms of disadvantage, ensuring that the most meritorious\napplicant gets hired. Opponents of affirmative action think that the\npolicy violates meritocratic hiring by giving some applicants\nadvantage (and others, perforce, disadvantage) on the basis of race\n(see, e.g., Reyna et al. 2005).\n\nAs Suhay, Tenenbaum, and Bartola describe things,\n\n\nEven controlling for partisanship and various demographic\ncharacteristics, perceptions of whether the U.S. economy is\nmeritocratic are strongly associated with people\u2019s views on\ntaxation, social welfare policy, affirmative action, and presidential\ncandidates\u2026. If citizens could develop a shared understanding\nof the ways in which the American economy fails to deliver\nmeritocratic outcomes, perhaps they would demand the two parties find\ncommon ground on policies designed to combat inequality. (2022: 9\nff.)\n\n\nThe way the public perceives social and economic realities\u2014as\nmeritocratic or not\u2014appears to play a crucial role in their\nmoral assessment of those realities.\n\nA curious feature of the debate is how both opponents and supporters\nof meritocracy appeal to the same facts in making their cases. Michael\nSandel (2020), for example, attacks today\u2019s culture of\n\u201ccredentialism\u201d (also known as \u201cpedigree\u201d), in\nwhich a diploma from an elite college is a de facto\nrequirement for entry into elite professions. Frequently, a less\nmeritorious but credentialed person (from, say, Harvard) is preferred\nto a more meritorious but uncredentialed person (UMass). Credentialism\nis, by Sandel\u2019s lights, a feature of meritocracy.\n\nMulligan (2018b) also attacks credentialism, arguing that meritocracy\nis the solution to it rather than its cause. A Harvard education is\nnot markedly better than a UMass education, but the returns to a\nHarvard education are enormously better than the returns to a UMass\neducation. The returns to a Harvard education are, thus, largely rent\n (\u00a74.3),\n and so credentialism is unmeritocratic.\n\nThe meritocracy debate is, to put it mildly, unsettled. This is a\nreflection of its philosophical richness. While meritocratic ideas\nhave been expressed and implemented for millennia, we still struggle\nto say exactly what meritocracy is and if it is desirable. We do not\nhave full answers to those questions. But perhaps we are now, at\nleast, beginning to understand them.\n",
