    "main_text": "\n\nOrganisms inherit various kinds of developmental information and cues\nfrom their parents. The study of inheritance systems is aimed at\nidentifying and classifying the various mechanisms and processes of\nheredity, the types of hereditary information that is passed on by\neach, the functional interaction between the different systems, and\nthe evolutionary consequences of these properties.\n\nIt is now common to identify heredity with the transmission of genes,\nor even more concretely with the transmission of DNA sequence, from\nparents to offspring. It is, however, clear on reflection that there\nare other ways in which offspring may receive from parents resources\nor cues that affect their development. This is particularly apparent\nin humans, and the suggestion that social and cultural cues may serve\nas an additional \u201cinheritance system\u201d has been made many\ntimes. These observations, and the models of dual inheritance of genes\nand culture (e.g., Boyd & Richerson 1985; Cavalli-Sforza &\nFeldman 1981; Durham 1991; for a recent overview see Mesoudi 2011,\nLewens 2015), are a useful starting point from which to approach the\nmore general project of elucidating the notion of inheritance system.\nCultural inheritance, however, is a broad category, whereas the\nanalysis of inheritance systems discussed below tends to be more\nfine-grained (see Sterelny 2001: 337). The term \u201cinheritance\nsystems\u201d is used to describe different mechanisms, processes,\nand factors, by which different kinds of hereditary information and\nvariation are stored and transmitted between generations.\n\nWe present the discussion of inheritance systems in the context of\nseveral debates. First, between proponents of monism about heredity\n(gene-centric views), holism about heredity (Developmental Systems\nTheory), and those stressing the role of multiple systems of\ninheritance. Second, between those analyzing inheritance solely in\nterms of replication and transmission, and views that stress the\nmulti-generation reproduction of phenotypic traits. A third debate is\nconcerned with different criteria that have been proposed for\nidentifying and delimiting inheritance systems. A fourth controversy\nrevolves around the evolutionary implications of the existence of the\ndifferent inheritance systems, for example the significance of the\n\u201cLamarckian\u201d aspects of some of the inheritance systems\nthat have been identified, such as epigenetic inheritance and\nbehavioral inheritance, as well as potentially the inheritance of\nmicrobial symbionts (i.e., the microbiome) that allow the transmission\nof environmentally induced characters (i.e., \u201csoft\ninheritance\u201d).\n\nThis entry is organized as follows: Sections 1 and 2 provide common\nground and historical context for the discussion. Section 3 discusses\nspecific accounts of inheritance systems. General evolutionary\nimplications are presented in section 4. Finally, section 5 summarizes\nsome of the open questions in the field.\n",
