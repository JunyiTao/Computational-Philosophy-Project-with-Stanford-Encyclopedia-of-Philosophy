Arrow\u2019s\npurpose in limiting individual inputs to weak orderings of the\nalternatives was to exclude cardinal information about utilities. This\nlimitation, though, is too tight for its purpose. One way for people\nto communicate their preferences is to grade their\nalternatives. Now, although in general grades do not carry cardinal\ninformation, Arrow\u2019s framework has no provision for people to input\ntheir preferences using them. This might seeem a small oversight on\nArrow\u2019s part but it is critical, because there are ways of aggregating\ngraded inputs that are not avaliable for preferance orderings, and\nwith them comes another \u201cescape\u201d from Arrow\u2019s\nimpossibility. Showing how it goes requires a slight extension of\nArrow\u2019s framework.\n\nLet a grade language \\(L\\) be a strictly ordered collection\nof expressions, the grades. The grades could be adjectival expressions\nof a natural language, such as excellent, \ngood, acceptable, poor and terrible,\nor they could be characters such as the familiar letter grades of\nacademic evaluation. They could be numerals (then often\ncalled scores) or the strings of stars commonly used to\nevaluate hotels and restaurants. They could be any symbols that come\nin some fixed order (from \u201ctop\u201d to\n\u201cbottom\u201d).\n\nA grade function \\(G_{i}\\) maps the set \\(X\\) of alternatives\ninto some given grade language \\(L\\). Intuitively, \\(G_{i}(x)\\) is\n\\(i\\)\u2019s grade for alternative \\(x\\). A grade function \\(G_{i}\\)\ncontains as much information as some weak ordering \\(R_{i}\\)\nof the alternatives. This can be seen by putting \\(xR_{i}y\\) if\n\\(G_{i}(x) \\ge G_{i}(y)\\): \\(i\\) weakly prefers \\(x\\) to \\(y\\) if\n\\(i\\)\u2019s grade for \\(x\\) is at least as high as \\(i\\)\u2019s grade for\n\\(y\\). In general \\(G_{i}\\) contains more information than\nthe corresponding ordering because we cannot always go in reverse:\ndifferent grade functions correspond to the same ordering. For\ninstance, one way to convey that \\(A\\) is preferable to \\(B\\) is to\nsay that whereas \\(A\\) is good, \\(B\\) is\nmerely acceptable; another is to say that whereas \\(A\\)\nis good, \\(B\\) is terrible, but this doesn\u2019t come to\nthe same thing because acceptable and terrible\ndon\u2019t. The additional information in grades is in general not cardinal\ninformation because for instance the expressions \ngood, acceptable and terrible, ordinary\nadjectives of English, do not carry cardinal information about how\ngood \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are.\n\nA grade profile is a list \\(\\langle G_{1}, \\ldots,\nG_{n}\\rangle\\) of grade functions, one for each of the people \\(1,\n\\ldots, n\\). Notions of a multiprofile domain and a social welfare\nfunction \\(f\\) are defined as in Arrow\u2019s framework, putting grade\nprofiles instead of Arrow\u2019s profiles of weak orders (the output of a\nsocial welfare function is not a social grading of the alternatives\nbut a social ordering of them, just in Arrow\u2019s original\nframework). The conditions of Arrow\u2019s theorem are reformulated\naccordingly; for instance, the reformulated domain assumption is: \n\nUnrestricted Domain (U): The domain of \\(f\\)\nincludes every list \\(\\langle G_{1}, \\ldots, G_{n}\\rangle\\) of \\(n\\)\ngrade functions defined on \\(X\\).\n\n Arrow\u2019s independence condition becomes:\n\nIndependence of Irrelevant Alternatives (I): For\nall alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) in \\(X\\), and all profiles \\(\\langle\nG_{i}\\rangle\\) and \\(\\langle G^*_{i}\\rangle\\) in the domain of \\(f\\), if\n\\(\\langle G_{i}\\rangle|\\{x,y\\} = \\langle G^*_{i}\\rangle|\\{x,y\\}\\), then\n\\(f\\langle G_{i}\\rangle |\\{x,y\\} = f\\langle G^*_{i}\\rangle\n|\\{x,y\\}\\).\n\n\nIntuitively, the reformulated independence assumption says that\nwhether one alternative ranks higher than another in the social\nordering depends only on everybody\u2019s grades for these two\nalternatives. Other alternatives are in this matter\n\u201cirrelevant.\u201d\n\nThere are social welfare functions that satisfy all conditions of\nArrow\u2019s theorem, reformulated for graded inputs. With an odd number\n\\(n\\) of people, for instance, the social welfare function median\ngrading fills the bill. Given a profile \\(\\langle G_{i}\\rangle\\)\nof grade functions, the median grade for an alternative \\(x\\)\nis the grade that is in the middle, when we list all the grades\n\\(G_{1}(x), \\ldots, G_{n}(x)\\) for \\(x\\) in order, from top to\nbottom. The social ordering associated with this profile goes by the\nalternatives\u2019 median grades: \\(x f\\langle G_{i}\\rangle y\\) means that\nthe median grade for \\(x\\) is either the same as the median grade for\n\\(y\\), or else it is higher.\n\nTo verify that median grading satisfies the reformulated conditions,\ntake for instance the nondictatorship condition. A person \\(d\\) is\na dictator of \\(f\\) if for any alternatives \\(x\\) and \\(y\\),\nand for any profile \\(\\langle\\ldots, G_{d},\\ldots\\rangle\\) in the\ndomain of \\(f\\): if \\(xP_{d}y\\), then \\(xPy\\). When \\(f\\) is median\ngrading, this means that whenever a dictator expresses a strict\npreference for one alternative over another, by giving it a higher\ngrade, this alternative also ranks strictly higher in the social\nordering, having a higher median grade. Except in the trivial case of\na language with only a single grade (which makes it impossible to\nexpress strict preferences, giving everybody vacuous dictatorial\npowers), and provided there are at least two alternatives and three\npeople, median grading on an unrestricted domain has no dictator. To\nsee that it is so, consider any given person \\(p\\), and any two\nalternatives \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In an unrestricted domain there is some\nprofile in which \\(p\\)\u2019s grade for \\(A\\) is higher than \\(p\\)\u2019s grade\nfor \\(B\\), but in which everybody else\u2019s grades for these alternatives\nare just the other way around: everybody other than \\(p\\) gives to\n\\(B\\) the same grade that \\(p\\) gives to \\(A\\), and gives to \\(A\\) the\nsame grade that \\(p\\) gives to \\(B\\). In this profile, the median\ngrade for \\(A\\) is \\(p\\)\u2019s grade for \\(B\\), and the median grade for\n\\(B\\) is \\(p\\)\u2019s grade for \\(A\\), which is higher. So although \\(p\\)\nstrictly prefers \\(A\\) to \\(B\\), \\(B\\) ranks strictly higher than\n\\(A\\) in the social ordering, and \\(p\\) is not a dictator. Repeating\nthis demonstration for each person, no one else is a dictator\neither. Satisfaction of the other reformulated conditions on the\nunrestricted domain of grade profiles is similarly\nstraightforward.\n\nMichel Balinski and Rida Laraki (2007) showed that scoring and grading\nenable an \u201cescape\u201d from Arrow\u2019s impossibility while\nstaying within an ordinal framework. Their theory of majority\njudgment is a generalization of median grading that makes more\nuse than it does of the ordinal information in grade profiles\n(Balinski and Laraki 2010). Balinski and Laraki insist that people\nmust share what they call a \u201ccommon language\u201d of grades,\nwithout giving this notion a precise sense. Indeed it can be shown\nthat, when different people might have very different thresholds for\nawarding grades, there is in grade profiles no more information than\nin the corresponding profiles of weak orderings. Then a close relative\nof Arrow\u2019s impossibility returns (Morreau 2016).\n\nArrow came to realize, late in his life, that scoring and grading\ncreate possibilities for democracy that his framework unnecessarily\nrules out of consideration. In a 2012 interview he noted:\n\nNow there\u2019s another possible way of thinking about it, which is not\nincluded in my theorem \\(\\ldots\\) [E]ach voter does not just give a\nranking. But says, this is good. And this is not good. Or this is very\ngood. And this is bad. So I have three or four classes \\(\\ldots\\) This\nchanges the nature of voting.\n\n\nFor a transcript of this interview, see the Other Internet Resources.\n",
