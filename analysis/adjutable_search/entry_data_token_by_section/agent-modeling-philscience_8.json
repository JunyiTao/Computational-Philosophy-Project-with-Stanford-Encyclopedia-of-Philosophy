    "main_text": "Central Research Questions || Scientific collaboration\n2.7 Scientific collaboration\n\nAs acquiring and analyzing scientific evidence can be highly\nresource-demanding for any individual scientist, scientific\ncollaboration is a widespread form of group inquiry. Of course, this\nis not the only reason why scientists collaborate: incentives leading\nto collaborations range from epistemic ones (such as increasing the\nquality of research) to non-epistemic ones (such as striving for\nrecognition). This raises the question: when is collaborating\nbeneficial, and which challenges may occur in collaborative research?\nInspired by these questions, philosophers of science have investigated\nwhy collaborations are beneficial (Wray 2002), which challenges they\npose on epistemic trust and accountability (Kukla 2012; Wagenknecht\n2015), what kind of knowledge emerges through collaborative research\n(such as collective beliefs or acceptances, (M. Gilbert 2000; Wray\n2007; Andersen 2010), which values are at stake in collaborations\n(Rolin 2015), what an optimal structure of collaborations is\n(Perovi\u0107, Radovanovi\u0107, Sikimi\u0107, & Berber 2016), and\nso on.\n\nABMs of collaboration were introduced to study the above and related\nquestions, focusing on how collaborating can impact inquiry. While\ncollaborations can indeed be beneficial, determining conditions under\nwhich they are such is not straightforward. For instance, depending on\nhow scientists engage in collaborations, minorities in the community\nmay end up disadvantaged. We will look at the models studying these\nissues in\n Section 4.7.\n",
