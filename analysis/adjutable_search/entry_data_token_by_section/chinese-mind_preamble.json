    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry covers major views of mind in the period of classical\nChinese philosophy (from about the 6th to the end of the\n3rd century BCE). The nearest equivalent to the English\nterm for mind in the classical period is xin \u5fc3, which\noriginated as a picture of the heart in human beings and animals and\ndirects body\u2019s behavior. Since ethical guidance in Chinese\nthought arises from both the cognitive function of the mind and the\naffective states attributed to the heart, xin is frequently\ntranslated as \u201cheart-mind\u201d. This translation will be used\nhere. The xin is credited with thinking si \u601d,\nunderstanding m\u00edng \u660e, knowing zhi\n\u77e5, intention zhi \u5fd7, felt moods and/or emotions\nqing \u60c5, and desire yu \u6b32. Xin\nplays a central role in Chinese ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics;\nand philosophical disputes often turn on how different schools or\nMasters portray the role of xin. How it arrives at\nethical guidance is a central point of contention between those who\ntreat the guidance as internal (Mengzi) to those who treat\nxin as navigating an external normative structure and those\nwho advocate emptying or ignoring the xin and taking guidance\nfrom some other organ or authority.\n\nThe term xin plays a major role in the classical texts with\nthe exception of the Mozi, where the discussion of many\nissues the other texts approach in terms of the heart-mind is couched\ninstead in terms of the knowing zhi \u77e5, the capacity,\nthe awareness or understanding, by which we come to know objects or\nacquire skills. Despite this difference, the Mozi shares with\nthe other classical texts a major concern for the learning and\npractice that enables people to act well and appropriately. The texts\nare profoundly practical, concerned with understanding how the\nheart-mind or the knowing works (descriptive epistemology, which has\nsurprising connections with contemporary cognitive and neuro-science)\nand how it should work (normative epistemology). What social\ninfluences should be trained into the heart-mind is a central concern\nof these texts\u2019 normative epistemology.\n\nPersistent issues that arise in Western discussions of the Chinese\ntheory of heart-mind involve its centrality to the person and the\nworld. As discussed below, different conceptions of the heart-mind in\nthe Chinese philosophical tradition motivate important distinctions in\nthe account of its role in the body (the Mengzi and the\nXunzi), in knowing and skills or crafts (the Mozi),\nand in relation to other natural creatures (the Daodejing and\nthe Zhuangzi).\n",
