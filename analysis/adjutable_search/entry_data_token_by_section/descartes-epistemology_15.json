    "main_text": "Perfect Knowledge, Circularity, and Truth || Self-Evident God Interpretation\n6.2 Self-Evident God Interpretation\n\nAgain, the hard question for unbounded doubt interpretations: Why,\nin the final analysis, does the Evil Genius Doubt eventually lose it\nundermining potency? One recent unbounded doubt interpretation (Newman\n& Nelson 1999) offers a solution, including an explanation of why\nDescartes waits until the end of the Fifth Meditation to claim final\nvictory over the sceptical problem. Here is a sketch of the\naccount.\n\nDescartes claims that his final solution to the sceptical problem\nmakes it \u201cimpossible for us ever to have any reason for\ndoubting what we are convinced of.\u201d Yet how is this \nimpossibility supposed to be achieved? We have seen\nthat the sticking point in the account is indirect doubt. \nDescartes rejects that we could overcome the problem via\nuninterrupted clear and distinct perception: \u201cmy nature is\nalso such that I cannot fix my mental vision continually on the\nsame thing, so as to keep perceiving it clearly; and often the\nmemory of a previously made judgement may come back, when I am\nno longer attending to the arguments which led me to make it.\u201d\nAt such moments of inattention, an indirect doubt remains possible\nso long as we can make sense of the evil genius scenario, or any\nother scenario wherein we have a defective cognitive nature. It\nthus seems that a final solution to the problem would need (somehow)\nto make it no longer possible to make sense of the relevant sceptical \nscenarios. Indeed, the proposed interpretation has it the sceptical \nscenarios become self-evidently incoherent. We come to have an\nutterly basic apprehension that we\u2019re the creation of an\nall-perfect creator who would not allow us to be deceived about\nwhat we clearly and distinctly perceive.\n\nThe needed apprehension of God would have to be self-evident. \nFor suppose my apprehension is grounded in a demonstration. In that \ncase, it\u2019s possible to think of the conclusion of that \ndemonstration without also thinking of the premises; and on such \noccasions, my confidence in the demonstration is vulnerable to an \nindirect doubt. Thus, the needed apprehension of God is a self-evident, \nclear and distinct conception that renders \u2013 as literally \nunthinkable \u2013 the very sceptical scenarios that underwrite \nindirect doubt.\n\nA useful analogy lies in the doubt-resisting character of the\ncogito. If I attempt a direct doubt of own my\nexistence, the effort is self-stultifying; I immediately apprehend\nthat I must exist, in order to attempt the doubt. What Descartes\nneeds is a similarly strong and immediate doubt-resisting outcome\nin connection with the very attempt at running an indirect \ndoubt. That is, on occasions of trying to undermine clearly and \ndistinctly perceived matters \u2013 e.g., by doubting God\u2019s \nexistence, or benevolence, or the like \u2013 the very effort at\ndoubt would be immediately thwarted.\n\nMultiple texts suggest that this is the account Descartes intends,\nand that the Fifth Meditation is the locus of the meditator\u2019s\ndiscovery of an enhanced, self-evident apprehension of God. The\nFifth Meditation introduces various themes about innate truths, \nincluding the positive epistemic effects of repeated meditation:\ntruths initially noticed only by means of inference might eventually \ncome to be apprehended self-evidently. In the build-up to the\npassage claiming that the Evil Genius Doubt is finally and fully \novercome, Descartes writes:\n\nSome of the things I clearly and distinctly perceive are obvious to\neveryone, while others are discovered only by those who look more\nclosely and investigate more carefully; but once they have been\ndiscovered, the latter are judged to be just as certain as the former.\nIn the case of a right-angled triangle, for example, the fact that the\nsquare on the hypotenuse is equal to the square on the other two sides\nis not so readily apparent as the fact that the hypotenuse subtends\nthe largest angle; but once one has seen it, one believes it just as\nstrongly. But as regards God, if I were not overwhelmed by\npreconceived opinions, and if the images of things perceived by the\nsenses did not besiege my thought on every side, I would certainly\nacknowledge him sooner and more easily than anything else. For what is\nmore self-evident [ex se est apertius] than the fact that the\nsupreme being exists, or that God, to whose essence alone existence\nbelongs, exists?\nAlthough it needed close attention for me to\nperceive this, I am now just as certain of it as I am of everything\nelse which appears most certain. And what is more, I see that the\ncertainty of all other things depends on this, so that without it\nnothing can ever be perfectly known. (AT 7:69, CSM 2:47f)\n\n\nDescartes reiterates the theme in the Second Replies:\n\nI ask my readers to spend a great deal of time and effort on\ncontemplating the nature of the supremely perfect being. Above all\nthey should reflect on the fact that the ideas of all other natures\ncontain possible existence, whereas the idea of God contains not only\npossible but wholly necessary existence. This alone, without a formal\nargument, will make them realize that God exists; and this will\neventually be just as self-evident [per se notum] to them as\nthe fact that the number two is even or that three is odd, and so on.\nFor there are certain truths which some people find self-evident,\nwhile others come to understand them only by means of a formal\nargument. (AT 7:163f, CSM 2:115)\n\n\nThese passages convey that one\u2019s apprehension of God eventually\nupgrades from being inferential, to being transparently self-evident.\nGranting that the meditator has achieved an apprehension of God of\nthis kind, it plausibly explains why Descartes would think he\u2019s\nachieved a final solution to the sceptical problem. Given his newfound\nepistemic standing, the meditator would be unable to make coherent\nsense of the Evil Genius Doubt. His clear and distinct perceptions\nwould be fully indubitable, thereby counting as perfect knowledge.\n\nThe interpretation helps explain two passages wherein Descartes\npurports to be detailing the final solution to the sceptical problem.\nIn both passages, he can seem simply to be asserting that\nsceptical doubts are impossible, as if having forgotten the\nindirect manner in which his own hyperbolic doubt operates.\nBut if we take Descartes to be assuming that the apprehension of God\nhas become utterly self-evident, both passages make more sense. The\none passage arises in the Second Replies, in the context of rebutting\nan objection to the effect that, in the final analysis, it remains\npossible to doubt clear and distinct perception. Descartes replies\nthat the objector is \u201cstill stuck fast\u201d in doubts\n\u201cput forward in the First Meditation,\u201d but \u201cvery\ncarefully removed in the succeeding Meditations,\u201d adding:\n\n[O]nce we have become aware that God exists it is necessary for us to\nimagine that he is a deceiver if we wish to cast doubt on what we\nclearly and distinctly perceive. And since it is impossible to\nimagine that he is a deceiver, whatever we clearly and distinctly\nperceive must be completely accepted as true and certain. (AT 7:144,\nCSM 2:103; italics added)\n\n\nThe other passage arises in the Fifth Meditation, in the concluding\nsummary explanation of how the sceptical problem is finally overcome.\nImportantly, on the present interpretation, is the context in which\nthe summary explanation occurs: namely, on the heels of revealing the\nnewly discovered thesis, that nothing \u201cis more self-evident than\nthe fact that the supreme being exists.\u201d In that context,\nDescartes explains that a final solution to the sceptical problem has\nbeen achieved.\n\nNow, however, I have perceived that God exists, and at the same time I\nhave understood that everything else depends on him, and that he is no\ndeceiver; and I have drawn the conclusion that everything which I\nclearly and distinctly perceive is of necessity true. Accordingly,\neven if I am no longer attending to the arguments which led me to\njudge that this is true, as long as I remember that I clearly and\ndistinctly perceived it, there are no counter-arguments which can be\nadduced to make me doubt it, but on the contrary I have true and\ncertain knowledge of it. And I have knowledge not just of this matter,\nbut of all matters which I remember ever having demonstrated, in\ngeometry and so on. For what objections can now be raised? That the\nway I am made makes me prone to frequent error? But I now know that I\nam incapable of error in those cases where my understanding is\ntransparently clear. Or can it be objected that I have in the past\nregarded as true and certain many things which I afterwards recognized\nto be false? But none of these were things which I clearly and\ndistinctly perceived: I was ignorant of this rule for establishing the\ntruth, and believed these things for other reasons which I later\ndiscovered to be less reliable. So what is left to say? (AT 7:70, CSM\n2:48f)\n\n\nAbsent a self-evident apprehension of God, the two passages appear\ninexplicable, with Descartes seeming to misunderstand the sceptical\nimplications of his own Evil Genius Doubt. But on the self-evident God\ninterpretation, both passages read as a summary of the anti-sceptical\neffects of it being impossible to conceive of God as a deceiver. As\nDescartes writes to Voetius, the very thought of God as a deceiver\n\u201cimplies a conceptual contradiction \u2013 that is, it cannot\nbe conceived\u201d (May 1643 letter, AT 8b:60, CSMK 222). The\ninterpretation also makes sense of why the final victory over\nscepticism is announced not at the end of the Fourth Meditation, but\nat the end the Fifth \u2013 i.e., after the enhanced, self-evident \napprehension of God is supposed to have been achieved.\n\n(For further discussion see Newman & Nelson 1999, Nolan 2005,\nand Nolan &and Nelson 2006.)\n",
