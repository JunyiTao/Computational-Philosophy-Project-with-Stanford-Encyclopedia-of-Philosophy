    "main_text": "Utilitarianism\n1. Utilitarianism\n\nA moral theory is a form of consequentialism if and only if it\nassesses acts and/or character traits, practices, and institutions\nsolely in terms of the goodness of the consequences. Historically,\nutilitarianism has been the best-known form of consequentialism.\nUtilitarianism assesses acts and/or character traits, practices, and\ninstitutions solely in terms of overall net benefit. Overall net\nbenefit is often referred to as aggregate well-being or welfare.\nAggregate welfare is calculated by counting a benefit or harm to any\none individual the same as the same size benefit or harm to any other\nindividual, and then adding all the benefits and harms together to\nreach an aggregate sum. There is considerable dispute among\nconsequentialists about what the best account of welfare is.\n",
