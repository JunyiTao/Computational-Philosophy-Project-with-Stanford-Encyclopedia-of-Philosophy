Since John Stuart Mill situated his father\u2019s Analysis in the debate between the \u201ca priori view of human knowledge, and of the knowing faculties\u201d and its \u201copposite doctrine\u2014that which derives all knowledge from experience, and all moral and intellectual qualities principally from the direction given to the associations,\u201d let\u2019s for a moment focus on this work. For the younger Mill, much like his own A System of Logic, his father\u2019s Analysis tried to combat a philosophical theory which made \u201cevery inveterate belief and every intense feeling, of which the origin is not remembered, [\u2026] into its own all-sufficient voucher and justification\u201d (J.S. Mill 1873, 233). In 1869, John Stuart Mill published a second edition of this essay with extended comments by himself, Alexander Bain, George Grote and Andrew Findlater, a noted philologist.\nFor James Mill, knowledge comes from sense experience. There are two kinds of sensations, he argued. The first kind is experienced when the object of sense is present. The sources of this kind of experience are the senses and the experience of those sensations which accompany muscle and digestive activity. The second kind is experienced when the object of sense is no longer present. Even after the sensation is gone, some sensory content, a \u201cbare fact,\u201d remains: \u201ca copy, an image, of the sensation, sometimes a representation, or trace, of the sensation,\" i.e. its idea (Mill 1829a, I.40\u201341). \u201c[D]uring the whole of our lives,\u201d James Mill argued, \u201ca series of those two states of consciousness, called sensations, and ideas, is constantly going on.\u201d He highlighted that ideas do not derive from objects but from sensations. And as sensations are either synchronous or successive, \u201c[o]ur ideas spring up, or exist, in the order in which the sensations existed,\u201d in space (simultaneous existence) and/or in time (antecedent and consequent existence) (Mill 1829a, I.52, 55\u201356).\nAssociation Psychology, as thus expounded, examines the links between experience as registered by a conscious mind and the ideas, or trains of ideas, which registered experience springs up. The strength or weakness of associations between a sensation and an idea or between ideas varies, depending on how permanent or vivid they are. Some associations are so firm and constant that they become indissoluble or inseparable, fusing the different aspects of the complex experience into a single cluster of associations. The vividness of a part of the cluster might engross the attention of the conscious mind. Sometimes the cluster is dominated by a sensation, sometimes by an idea. Generally speaking, Mill noted, sensations are more vivid than ideas, the painful or pleasurable sensations or ideas are more vivid than indifferent ones, and the more recent are more vivid than less recent ones (Mill 1829a, I.60\u201363). The perceiving mind attends only to a part of the sense experience, both at the moment of sensation and, consequently, in its copy, image or representation. In History of British India, Mill used this \u201claw\u201d of human nature to explain how a philosophic historian never had to set foot in a foreign country to write its history:\nIn a cursory survey, it is understood, that the mind, unable to attend to the whole of an infinite number of objects, attaches itself to a few; and overlooks the multitude that remain. But what, then, are the objects to which the mind, in such a situation, is in preference attracted? Those which fall in with the current of its own thoughts; those which accord with its former impressions; those which confirm its previous ideas.\nSifting through different testimonies of the same phenomenon, as a judge, one might thus compound a more comprehensive idea of it rather than by being an actual eye witness (Mill 1818, I.xii-xiv; Loizides 2019b).\nFor James Mill, the individual maintains some command over sensations (i.e. in a controlled environment) as they derive from sensible objects. However, one cannot recall ideas or trains of ideas at will, Mill pointed out: \u201cThoughts come into the mind unbidden.\u201d But ideas can be linked with sensible objects, such as sounds, smells, sights, and so on. Language thus provides signs, e.g. audible and visible, which mark sensations and recall ideas (Mill 1829a, I.86\u201389). This way knowledge acquired from the past can be used to guide the future. For example, certain words recall certain ideas and trains of ideas. These ideas or trains of ideas, with or without additional links, might lead to certain behavioral responses, e.g. thoughts, emotions, actions. Analyses of chains of associations identify the links between elicited responses (last step) and actual experience (first step). This is almost impossible to do in cases of indissoluble association, as sensations, ideas and trains of ideas are fused together indiscriminately. Hence, even though most children associate darkness with ghosts, Mill offered an example, \u201c[i]n some this association is soon dissolved,\u201d in others \u201cit continues for life,\u201d especially come the night (Mill 1829a, I.60, 286\u201387). Even a mind like Bentham\u2019s had failed to dissolve such an association.\n",
