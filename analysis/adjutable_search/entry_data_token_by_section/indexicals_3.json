Thus\nmany think that true demonstratives (from here on, simply\ndemonstratives) require something more than pure indexicals to\nacquire a reference and content. The nature of this \u201cextra\nsomething\u201d is controversial, but two widely discussed candidates\nare demonstrations (or pointing gestures) and\nspeakers\u2019 intentions.\n\n\nIn his 1989a, Kaplan emphasizes the role of pointing gestures in\nfixing the reference (and content) of a demonstrative. More precisely,\nhe says that the reference of a demonstrative in a context is fixed by\na demonstration, which he describes as \u201ctypically,\nthough not invariably, a (visual) presentation of a local object\ndiscriminated by a pointing.\u201d (1989a, p. 490). Kaplan changes his\nmind in his 1989b. He there states that he had always thought that a\ndemonstration is \u201ctypically directed by the speaker\u2019s\nintention to point at a perceived individual on whom he has\nfocused.\u201d He then calls such intentions directing\nintentions and says that he has come to \u201cregard the\ndirecting intention, at least in the case of perceptual demonstratives,\nas criterial, and to regard the demonstration as a mere\nexternalization of this inner intention.\u201d (1989b,\np. 582)\n\n\nOther theorists have proposed other accounts. Michael Devitt (1981)\nsays that the referent of an utterance of \u2018that\u2019 is the\nitem that stands in a certain causal relation to the utterance. Colin\nMcGinn (1981) proposes that the referent of an utterance of \u2018that\n\\(F\\)\u2019 is the first \\(F\\) to intersect the line\nprojected from the speaker\u2019s pointing finger. Howard Wettstein\n(1984) says that the reference of \u2018that\u2019 is determined by\nthe cues that a competent and attentive addressee would reasonably take\nthe speaker to be exploiting. Marga Reimer (1991a, 199b) argues that\ndemonstrative utterances can refer to objects that are not the targets\nof the speaker\u2019s directing intentions, contrary to what she takes\nKaplan (1989b) to be arguing. Kent Bach (1992a, 1992b) claims that the\nobject to which a speaker refers with a demonstrative is fixed by\ncertain of the speaker\u2019s communicative intentions. Perry (2009,\np. 60) argues that the referent of an utterance of a demonstrative is\nthe object of a directing intention, and offers a rather elaborate\ntheory of directing intentions that is inspired by some brief remarks\nfrom Kaplan. Jeffrey King (2012) argues that the semantic value of a\ndemonstrative in a context is the object such that (a) the speaker\nintends it to be the demonstrative\u2019s semantic value and (b) an\nattentive hearer would take it to be the speaker\u2019s intended\nsemantic value.\n\n\nOne prima facie problem for demonstration-theories is that\ndemonstratives sometimes refer in contexts in which the speaker does\nnot produce a pointing gesture. If \u2018here\u2019 and\n\u2018now\u2019 are true demonstratives, or discretionary indexicals,\nthen they may present a particular difficulty for\ndemonstration-theories, for pointing gestures often seem irrelevant to\ndetermining their referents and contents in contexts. One prima\nfacie problem for intention-theorists is that speakers typically\nhave many intentions when they use demonstratives, and these intentions\nmay conflict (Bach 1992a, 1992b; Perry 1997, 2001 p. 60, 2009; King\n2013). For example, a speaker who utters \u2018he\u2019 may intend to\nspeak about Joe, about the man that she sees, about the man that others\nare referring to, and about the man at whom she is pointing. The\nspeaker may think these are the same person when they are not.\n",
