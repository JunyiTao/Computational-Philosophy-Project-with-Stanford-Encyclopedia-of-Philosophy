Work and its Future\n\nA number of social commentators have predicted that economic and\ntechnological trends will soon culminate in societies become\nincreasingly \u2018post-work,\u2019 that is, far fewer individuals\nwill engage in paid work, work hours will dramatically decrease, and\nwork will have a far smaller role among individuals\u2019 values or\nconcerns.(Frey and Osborne 2013, Thompson 2015, Brynjolofsson and\nMcAfee 2014). Whether this prospect should be welcomed or avoided\ndepends to a large extent on issues addressed earlier in this article:\nhow good work in fact is, whether there are other avenues for\nattaining the goods associated with work, etc.\n\nSome welcome a post-work future as liberating (Livingston 2016,\nChamberlain 2018, James 2018, Danaher 2019), arguing that diminutions\nin the centrality of work will afford us greater leisure, freedom, or\ncommunity, especially if activities such as play or the appreciation\nof the natural worlds supplant work. Others worry that the decline of\nwork will deprive us of a central arena in which to realize goods\ncentral to our natures (Deranty 2015) or will instigate high levels of\ninequality or economic distress (Frase 2016). Others express concern\nabout individuals\u2019 ability to psychologically transition from a\nwork-centred to a work-optional society (Cholbi 2018b).\n",
