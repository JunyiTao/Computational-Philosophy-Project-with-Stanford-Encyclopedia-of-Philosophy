    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nBonaventure was born in Civita di Bagnoregio in central Italy, an\nancient city perched atop a constantly eroding volcanic butte. Though\nDante placed Bonaventure among the saints in his Paradiso\n(Canto 12), and reports of Bonaventure\u2019s holiness circulated in\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, no official cult emerged\nafter his death and the papacy did not recognize him as a saint until\n1482 (on Bonaventure\u2019s canonization see Finucane 2011:\n33\u201370). Had Bonaventure been canonized earlier, there might be\nmore information about his life to sift, as there is in the case of\nhis contemporary, Thomas Aquinas. What we can know about\nBonaventure\u2019s early life comes from his own hagiographical work\non St. Francis of Assisi, the Legenda major and\nminor, where he attests to being healed miraculously by St.\nFrancis:\n\n\nwhen I was a boy, as I still vividly remember, I was snatched from the\njaws of death by his invocation and merits. (Legenda maior,\nprol. 3, [FA:ED: Volume 2, 528]; cf. Legenda minor, lec. 8.\nTexts of Bonaventure will be quoted in the Quaracchi edition,\n1882\u20131902, unless a more recent edition\n exists[1])\n\n\nOne certain date, Bonaventure\u2019s election as Minister General of\nthe Franciscans on 2 February 1257, permits a broad division of his\nlife into two clear periods: an academic and a pastoral\n period.[2]\n The academic period runs from c. 1235\u20131257. During those years,\nBonaventure studied and taught philosophy and theology at the\nUniversity of Paris and acquired the degree of Master in both\ndisciplines. The pastoral period runs from 1257\u20131274. During\nthat time, Bonaventure served as Minister General, relinquishing the\noffice on 19 May 1274 when Jerome of Ascoli was elected to replace\nhim. On 28 May 1273 Bonaventure became a Cardinal and was later\nconsecrated bishop of Albano (11 November 1273). Bonaventure died at\nthe second council of Lyon, 15 July 1274.\n\nA fuller chronology of Bonaventure\u2019s academic period can emerge\nfrom sifting through various chronicles and from utilizing the data of\nscholars\u2019 evolving knowledge of the medieval University of Paris\nand its degree programs. The general consensus remains that\nBonaventure left Bagnoregio for Paris in 1235 and studied philosophy\nuntil 1243. A student\u2019s guidebook from the faculty of arts at\nParis (c. 1240) provides a glimpse of Bonaventure\u2019s training,\nwhile his own works display his mastery of this discipline (anonymous,\nLe \u201cguide de l\u2019\u00e9tudiant\u201d).\nBonaventure clearly knew and utilized the emerging corpus of Aristotle\nand his Arabic commentators. The Parisian program in arts favored\nlogic and Bonaventure mastered and utilized this art, displaying his\nmastery in discussion of metaphysical and theological issues. A text\nlike Peter of Spain\u2019s Summaries of Logic\n(13th century) displays the kind of logical training\nBonaventure probably received. Notably, scholars have not yet\nidentified any works from Bonaventure\u2019s period as a student or\nmaster of philosophy at Paris.\n\nBy 1244 Bonaventure had completed his degree in philosophy and was a\nprofessed Franciscan friar. Bonaventure\u2019s Letter to an\nUnknown Master (commonly dated to the mid 1250s) gives some\ninsight into why he chose the Franciscans and displays his attitude to\nphilosophy at this\n time.[3]\n In one important passage of the Letter he writes:\n\n\nAnd so, if the writings of the philosophers are sometimes of much\nvalue in understanding truth and refuting errors, we are not departing\nfrom the purity of faith if we at times study them, especially since\nthere are many questions of faith which cannot be settled without\nrecourse to them. (trans. Monti 1994: 53)\n\n\nBonaventure\u2019s corpus shows that while he could be deeply\ncritical of positions he identified as philosophical errors\n(especially in his last work, the Collationes in\nHexa\u00ebmeron), he consistently utilized philosophy and\nphilosophical authors in his theological and spiritual writings.\n\nFrom 1243 to 1248, Bonaventure studied theology at Paris, surely\nworking closely with the Franciscan masters of this period: Alexander\nof Hales (d. 1245), John of La Rochelle (d. 1245), Eudes Rigaud\n(master c. 1245\u20131248), and then William of Middleton (master c.\n1248\u20131254). At this point, Salimbene provides another important\ndate but one that requires some interpretation. Writing about 1280,\nSalimbene states:\n\n\nBr. John of Parma [Franciscan Minister General] gave the license to\nBr. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio to read at Paris, which he had never yet\ndone because he was not yet installed in a Chair. He then read the\nwhole Gospel of St. Luke, a commentary that is very beautiful and\ncomplete. This was in 1248. (Salimbene, Cronica\n[Hodder-Egger: 209] and Hammond\n 2009)[4]\n\n\nSalimbene\u2019s report cannot mean that John of Parma gave\nBonaventure a license in theology from the University of Paris, since\nJohn had no authority to confer this degree. The license John granted\nBonaventure must therefore have been internal to the Order. Perhaps\nJohn made Bonaventure a lector or granted him what scholars have\ncalled the Franciscan\u2019s second, internal chair at\n Paris.[5]\n In any case, the usual interpretation is that Bonaventure lectured on\nthe Bible cursorie as a \u201cBachelor of the Bible\u201d,\nbetween 1248 and 1250/51. Then, from c. 1252\u201353 he commented on\nthe Sentences, likely lecturing on the whole of the\nSentences in one year, in the typical order\n I\u2013IV\u2013II\u2013III.[6]\n Once Master, he revised the Commentary (Commentaria in\nQuattuor Libros Sententiarum), his major philosophical and\ntheological work. In 1253 he was a \u201cformed Bachelor\u201d of\nTheology, performing the three duties of a Master: lecturing on the\nBible, engaging in disputations, and preaching. In 1253 the Masters\nand students of the University of Paris went on strike, all but the\nfriars. The two Dominican masters and the Franciscan William of\nMiddleton continued to teach and refused to take an oath of loyalty to\nthe University. They were expelled from the \u201cuniversity of\nmasters\u201d, an action defended by the University in a letter of 4\nFebruary (Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis I, no. 230:\n252\u20138, trans. Thorndike\n 56\u201364).[7]\n Bonaventure received the licentia docendi by Easter 1254, in\nthe midst of this conflict. He assumed the Franciscan Chair in\ntheology immediately, but taught only at the Franciscan convent,\nunrecognized by the University.\n\nBonaventure performed all three tasks of a Master of Theology from\n1254\u201357. He revised his commentary on Luke and composed\ncommentaries on John and Ecclesiastes. He also held three sets of\ndisputed questions. The questions On the Knowledge of Christ\n(De scientia Christi), which develop his illumination theory\nof knowledge, may come from 1254. The questions, On the Mystery of\nthe Trinity (De mysterio Trinitatis), which elaborated\nhis view of God, certainly followed On the knowledge of\nChrist, since they cite this disputation. Bonaventure also\ndisputed a third set of questions On Evangelical Perfection\n(De perfectione evangelica). These questions defended the\nfriars\u2019 way of life from the attacks of non-mendicant Masters\nled by William of St. Amour in 1255 (Bougerol 1982; Traver 1995 and\n1999). In October 1256, Pope Alexander IV ordered the secular Masters\nat Paris to accept Bonaventure and the Dominican Thomas Aquinas in\ntheir rightful places as Masters of Theology, but it was not until 12\nAugust 1257 that they did so. Six months earlier Bonaventure had been\nappointed Minister\n General.[8]\n In addition to the normal writings pertaining to his tasks as a\nMaster of Theology, Bonaventure produced numerous sermons during this\nperiod. One text, related to the genre of sermons and known as On\nRetracing the Arts to Theology (Opusculum de reductione\nartium ad theologiam) may have originated as the second half of\nBonaventure\u2019s inaugural sermon as a Master of Theology (Benson\n2012). In 1257, while leaving the University and beginning his tenure\nas Minister General, Bonaventure also managed to compose his\nBreviloquium, a brief and popular synthesis of theology.\n\nAs noted above, Bonaventure\u2019s \u201cpastoral period\u201d runs\nfrom 1257\u20131274. Scholars can often pinpoint Bonaventure\u2019s\nactivities at this time by utilizing his sermons and by studying\ndocuments related to the Franciscan Order (Quinn 1974; Bourgerol (ed.)\n1990). Bonaventure traveled extensively to visit Franciscan houses but\nmaintained Paris as his chief residence (Monti 2014). During this\nperiod, Bonaventure\u2019s writings reflected the needs of the Order,\nbut he did not cast aside his Parisian philosophical and theological\ntraining. Bonaventure quickly set a firm direction for the Order in an\n\u201cencyclical letter\u201d to all the friars on 23 April 1257,\nwhich admonished them to recover the \u201csomewhat tarnished\u201d\nluster of the Order (Monti 1994). Amid his other duties, Bonaventure\ncomposed three extremely popular tracts between 1257 and 1260 for the\nspiritual training of the friars: A Soliloquy about Four Mental\nExercises (Soliloquium de quatuor mentalibus\nexercitiis), The Tree of Life (Lignum vitae),\nand The Triple Way (De triplici via) (Coughlin 2006;\nCousins\n 1978).[9]\n\nBonaventure\u2019s most popular work today was also composed at this\ntime. For Francis\u2019s feast day in October, 1259, Bonaventure\nvisited Mt. Alverna, the very place where Francis himself had received\na mystical vision of Christ \u201cunder the appearance\u201d of\n\u201ca Seraph having six wings\u201d and had \u201cimprinted in\nhis flesh\u201d the stigmata or wounds of Christ (Legenda\nmaior 13.3 [FA:ED: Volume 2, 632\u2013633]). Here Bonaventure\nconceived the idea for his Journey of the Mind to God\n(Itinerarium mentis in Deum), a mental and spiritual journey\nto God whose basic outline\u2014though not its details\u2014could be\nunderstood by even the simplest friar (Armstrong 2020 is the most\nrecent English translation, offering extensive notes). The text\ndisplays Bonaventure\u2019s philosophical and theological training in\nthe service of articulating how to contemplate God. The journey\nfollows the route first charted by St. Augustine\u2014from the\nexterior world to the interior mind, and from the interior but\ninferior human mind to the superior mind, namely, to God. Bonaventure\nunderstood the six wings of the angelic Seraph Francis saw to stand\nfor six ways God can be approached. Among other things, the series of\nsix chapters also stood for Bonaventure as the six days of creation.\nHe therefore arranged his Journey into six chapters of mental\nwork followed by a seventh chapter on mystical rest. The two lower\nwings of the Seraph symbolize seeing God through \u201cfootprints\n(vestigia)\u201d, signs in the sub-human world that point to\nGod, including signs in the physical universe itself (c. 1) and signs\nfound in the sensory life humans have in common with other animals (c.\n2). The two middle wings of the Seraph symbolize seeing God in his\n\u201cimage\u201d, namely, in humans understood as bearing within\ntheir intellectual nature special signs pointing to God. Here\nBonaventure distinguished signs of God found in the\n\u201cnatural\u201d exercise of the mind in theoretical knowledge\n(c. 3) from those found in its exercise in the practical sphere\n\u201creformed by grace\u201d (c. 4). The two highest wings of the\nSeraph symbolize seeing the light of God, first in the way reason sees\nGod as having one divine nature (c. 5) and then as faith sees God in\nthe Trinity of persons (c. 6). These three sets of twin\n\u201csteps\u201d culminate in the \u201cmental and mystical\ntransport\u201d found in mystical experience (c. 7), the end of the\nJourney. For each step, Bonaventure used material from\nearlier writings; but the Journey, like all his later works,\nis a synthesis the Minister General never had the leisure to expand.\nIn the Journey, he achieves a combination of scriptural\nimagery, philosophic depth, mystical yearning, and a density more\nmeditative than demonstrative, as befitting the genre of the text. The\nJourney, nevertheless, provides an appropriate outline for\nlooking at Bonaventure\u2019s philosophy which will be pursued\nbelow.\n\nThe General Chapter of 1260 held in Narbonne, France, the first where\nBonaventure presided, ratified his codification of the legal statutes\nunder which Franciscans lived, known as the \u201cConstitutions of\nNarbonne\u201d and also asked him to write a definitive Life of\nSt. Francis, which he did in 1261. These two works set the Order\non a moderate course that lasted for centuries and led Franciscans to\nrevere Bonaventure as their \u201csecond founder\u201d.\n\nFor most of the period from 1257 through 1266 Bonaventure trekked\nthrough France and Italy by foot, as did all friars when they\ntraveled. In 1266 he returned to Paris, where his friars were under\nattack both from conservatives in the Theology faculty and from\nradicals in Arts. Bonaventure began giving a series of collations\n(sermons offered in the morning and evening) which he considered a\nsequence: Collations on the Ten Commandments (Collationes\nde decem praeceptis), Lent of 1267; Collations on the Seven\nGifts of the Holy Spirit (Collationes de septem donis\nSpiritus sancti), Lent of 1268; and Collations on the\nHexa\u00ebmeron (Collationes in Hexa\u00ebmeron) during\nEaster-tide of 1273, a series that was never finished and is often\nregarded as a masterpiece of medieval theology. Though the issues\ncovered in these collations range across nearly the whole of Christian\ntheology, they have come to be understood as Bonaventure at his most\npolemical, since in them he attacks the three philosophical errors\nthat he believes are the most dangerous: the eternity of the world,\nthe necessity of fate, and that there is one intellect for all human\nbeings (On these collations see Ratzinger 1959 [1971] and\n 2009).[10]\n Bonaventure thought all three of these errors undermined Christian\nfaith, the last of the three impacting the doctrineof salvation\n itself.[11]\n Notably, the series of collations are close in time to 10 December\n1270, when certain Aristotelian positions were condemned by the Bishop\nof Paris, \u00c9tienne Tempier.\n\nIn addition to these important collations, in 1269 Bonaventure again\ndefended mendicant life from the critiques of secular clergy in his\nApologia pauperum (Defense of the Mendicants). The\nlast period of Bonaventure\u2019s life saw him rise to become one of\nthe most prominent men in Christendom. During the three-year Papal\nvacancy, from 29 November 1268 to 1 September 1271, Bonaventure\npreached an important sermon in Viterbo and was perhaps instrumental\nin ending the vacancy. He is said to have been offered the papacy by\nthe electors and to have suggested Teobaldi Visconti instead. After\nTeobaldi\u2019s election as Pope Gregory X, he appointed Bonaventure\ncardinal on 28 May 1273 (Franchi, 1981); Bartholomew of Pisa, the\nearliest source for Bonaventure suggesting Teobaldo\u2019s name,\nwrote ca. 1385.). At the Second Council of Lyon, Bonaventure labored\nfor the reunification of eastern and western Churches, a major goal of\nthe Council which seemed to have been achieved when he suddenly fell\nill on 15 July 1274. The acts of the council then report:\n\n\nat the hour of Matins died Br. Bonaventure of happy memory, Bishop of\nAlbano, who was a man eminent for his knowledge and eloquence\n(homo eminentis scientie et eloquentie), a man outstanding\nfor his sanctity and acknowledged for the excellence of his life, both\nreligious and moral \u2026 Br. Peter of Tarantasia [also a Cardinal]\ncelebrated the funeral mass and preached on the theme \u201cI am\nsaddened over you, my brother Jonathan\u201d. There were many tears\nand much weeping, for the Lord had given him such grace that the\nhearts of all who saw him were seized with a desire for his love.\n(Franchi 1965: 95; in Bougerol, 1988: 11)\n\n",
