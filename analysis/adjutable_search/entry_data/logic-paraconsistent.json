    "preamble": "\n\nA standard contemporary logical view has it that, from contradictory\npremises, anything follows. A logical consequence relation is\nexplosive if according to it any arbitrary conclusion \\(B\\)\nis entailed by any arbitrary contradiction \\(A\\), \\(\\neg A\\) (ex\ncontradictione quodlibet (ECQ)). Classical logic, and most\nstandard \u2018non-classical\u2019 logics too such as intuitionist\nlogic, are explosive. Inconsistency, according to received wisdom,\ncannot be coherently reasoned about.\n\nParaconsistent logic challenges this standard view. A logical consequence\nrelation is said to be paraconsistent if it is not explosive.\nThus, if a consequence relation is paraconsistent, then even in\ncircumstances where the available information is inconsistent, the\nconsequence relation does not explode into triviality. Thus,\nparaconsistent logic accommodates inconsistency in a controlled way\nthat treats inconsistent information as potentially informative.\n\nThe prefix \u2018para\u2019 in English has two meanings:\n\u2018quasi\u2019 (or \u2018similar to, modelled on\u2019) or\n\u2018beyond\u2019. When the term \u2018paraconsistent\u2019 was\ncoined by Mir\u00f3 Quesada at the Third Latin America Conference on\nMathematical Logic in 1976, he seems to have had the first meaning in\nmind. Many paraconsistent logicians, however, have taken it to mean\nthe second, which provided different reasons for the development of\nparaconsistent logic as we will see below.\n\nParaconsistent logic is defined negatively: any logic is\nparaconsistent as long as it is not explosive. This means there is no\nsingle set of open problems or programs in paraconsistent logic. As\nsuch, this entry is not a complete survey of paraconsistent logic. The\naim is to describe some philosophically salient features of a diverse\nfield.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Paraconsistency\n\nA logic is paraconsistent iff its logical consequence\nrelation \\((\\vDash\\), either semantic or proof theoretic) is not\nexplosive. Paraconsistency is a property of a consequence relation.\nThe argument ex contradictione quodlibet (ECQ) is\nparaconsistently invalid: in general, it is not the case that \\(A\\),\n\\(\\neg A \\vDash B\\).\n\nThe role often played by the notion of consistency in orthodox logics,\nnamely, the most basic requirement that any theory must meet, is\nrelaxed to the notion of coherence: no theory can include\nevery sentence whatsoever if it is to be considered tenable. Simple\nconsistency of a theory (no contradictions) is a special case of\nabsolute consistency, or non-triviality (not every sentence\nis a part of the theory). As we will see below, many paraconsistent\nlogics do validate the Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC), \\(\\vDash \\neg(A\n\\wedge \\neg A)\\), even though they invalidate ECQ.\n\nBeyond the basic, definitional requirement that a paraconsistent\nconsequence relation be non-explosive, there is a huge divergence of\nparaconsistent logics. At this stage of development, well into the\ntwenty-first century, it seems fair to say that\n\u2018paraconsistency\u2019 does not single out one particular\napproach to logic, but is rather a property that some logics have and\nothers do not (like, say, compactness, or multiple conclusions).\n1.1 Dialetheism\n\nIn the literature, especially in the part of it that contains\nobjections to paraconsistent logic, there has been some tendency to\nconfuse paraconsistency with dialetheism, the view that there\nare true contradictions (see the entry on\n dialetheism).\n The view that a consequence relation should be paraconsistent does\nnot entail the view that there are true contradictions.\nParaconsistency is a property of a consequence relation whereas\ndialetheism is a view about truth. The fact that one can define a\nnon-explosive consequence relation does not mean that some sentences\nare true. The fact that one can construct a model where a\ncontradiction holds but not every sentence of the language holds (or\nwhere this is the case at some world) does not mean that the\ncontradiction is true per se. Hence paraconsistency must be\ndistinguished from dialetheism. This has been argued recently by\nBarrio and Da R\u00e9 (2018), and an explicitly non-dialetheic\ninterpretation of paraconsistency is given by Carnielli and Rodrigues\n(2021). For reasons that paraconsistency may lead to dialetheism\nafter all, see Asmus 2012.\n\nDialetheism is the view that some contradiction is true, which is a distinct thesis from\n\u2018trivialism\u2019, the view that everything whatsoever\n(including every contradiction) is true; if dialetheism is to be coherent, then it seems a dialethiest\u2019s preferred logic must be paraconsistent (though even this has been challenged by Barrio and Da R\u00e9, based on work by Ripley and others e.g. Ripley 2012). A paraconsistent logician may feel some pull towards dialetheism, but most paraconsistent logics are\nnot \u2018dialetheic\u2019 logics. In a discussion of paraconsistent\nlogic, the primary focus is not the obtainability of contradictions\nbut the explosive nature of a consequence relation.\n1.2 A Brief History of ex contradictione quodlibet\n\nIt is now standard to view ex contradictione quodlibet as\nvalid. This contemporary view, however, should be put in a historical\nperspective. It was towards the end of the nineteenth century, when\nthe study of logic achieved mathematical articulation, that an\nexplosive logical theory became the standard. With the work of\nlogicians such as Boole, Frege, Russell and Hilbert, classical logic\nbecame the orthodox logical account.\n\nIn antiquity, however, no one seems to have endorsed the validity of\nECQ. Aristotle presented what is sometimes called the connexive\nprinciple: \u201cit is impossible that the same thing should be\nnecessitated by the being and by the not-being of the same\nthing\u201d (Prior Analytic II 4 57b3). (Connexive logic has\nrecently been reinvigorated by Wansing, e.g. Omori and Wansing 2019; see the entry on\n connexive logic\n that has been developed based on this principle.) This principle\nbecame a topic of debates in the Middle Ages or Medieval time. Though\nthe medieval debates seem to have been carried out in the context of\nconditionals, we can also see it as debates about consequences. The\nprinciple was taken up by\n Boethius\n (480\u2013524 or 525) and\n Abelard\n (1079\u20131142), who considered two accounts of consequences. The\nfirst one is a familiar one: it is impossible for the premises to be\ntrue but conclusion false. The first account is thus similar to the\ncontemporary notion of truth-preservation. The second one is less\naccepted recently: the sense of the premises contains that of the\nconclusion. This account, as in some\n relevant logics (like Brady\u2019s logic of meaning containment (Brady 2006)),\n does not permit an inference whose conclusion is arbitrary. Abelard\nheld that the first account fails to meet the connexive principle and\nthat the second account (the account of containment) captured\nAristotle\u2019s principle.\n\nAbelard\u2019s position was shown to face a difficulty by Alberic of\nParis in the 1130s. Most medieval logicians didn\u2019t, however,\nabandon the account of validity based on containment or something\nsimilar (see, for example, Martin 1987). But one way to handle the\ndifficulty is to reject the connexive principle. This approach, which\nhas become most influential, was accepted by the followers of Adam\nBalsham or Parvipontanus (or sometimes known as Adam of The Little\nBridge [12th century]). The Parvipontanians embraced the\ntruth-preservation account of consequences and the\n\u2018paradoxes\u2019 that are associated with it. In fact, it was a\nmember of the Parvipontanians, William of Soissons, who discovered in\nthe twelfth century what we now call the C.I. Lewis (independent)\nargument for ECQ (see Martin 1986).\n\nThe containment account, however, did not disappear.\n John Duns Scotus\n (1266\u20131308) and his followers accepted the containment account\n(see Martin 1996). The Cologne School of the late fifteenth century\nargued against ECQ by rejecting disjunctive syllogism (see\nSylvan 2000).\n\nIn the history of logic in Asia, there is a tendency (for example, in\nJaina and Buddhist traditions) to consider the possibility of\nstatements being both true and false. Moreover, the logics developed\nby the major Buddhist logicians, Dign\u0101ga (5th century)\nand Dharmak\u012brti (7th century) do not embrace ECQ.\nTheir logical account is, in fact, based on the\n\u2018pervasion\u2019 (Skt: vy\u0101pti, Tib: khyab\npa) relation among the elements of an argument. Just like the\ncontainment account of Abelard, there must be a tighter connection\nbetween the premises and conclusion than the truth-preservation\naccount allows. For the logic of Dharmak\u012brti and its subsequent\ndevelopment, see for example Dunne 2004, and Tillemans 1999, 2016.\n1.3 Modern History of Paraconsistent Logic\n\nIn the twentieth century, alternatives to an explosive account of\nlogical consequence occurred to different people at different times\nand places independently of each other. They were often motivated by\ndifferent considerations. The earliest paraconsistent logics in the\ncontemporary era seem to have been given by two Russians. Starting\nabout 1910, Vasil\u2019\u00e9v proposed a modified Aristotelian\nsyllogistic including statements of the form: \\(S\\) is both \\(P\\) and\nnot \\(P\\). In 1929, Orlov gave the first axiomatisation of the\nrelevant logic \\(R\\) which is paraconsistent. (On\nVasil\u2019\u00e9v, see Arruda 1977 and Arruda 1989: 102f; on\nOrlov, see Anderson, Belnap, & Dunn 1992: xvii.)\n\nThe work of Vasil\u2019\u00e9v or Orlov did not make any impact at\nthe time. The first (formal) logician to have developed paraconsistent\nlogic was Ja\u015bkowski in Poland, who was a student of\n\u0141ukasiewicz, who himself had envisaged paraconsistent logic in\nhis critique of Aristotle on the LNC (\u0141ukasiewicz 1951). Almost\nat the same time, Halld\u00e9n (1949) presented work on the logic of\nnonsense, but again this went mostly unnoticed.\n\nParaconsistent logics were developed independently in South America by\nFlorencio Asenjo and especially Newton da Costa in their doctoral\ndissertations, in 1954 and 1963 respectively, with an emphasis on\nmathematical applications (see Asenjo 1966, da Costa 1974). An active\ngroup of logicians has been researching paraconsistent logic\ncontinuously ever since, especially in Campinas and S\u00e3o Paulo,\nBrazil, with a focus on logics of formal inconsistency. Carnielli and\nConiglio (2016) give a comprehensive recent account of this work.\n\nParaconsistent logics in the forms of relevant logics were proposed in\nEngland by Smiley in 1959 and also at about the same time, in a much\nmore developed form, in the United States by Anderson and Belnap. An\nactive group of relevant logicians grew up in Pittsburgh including\nDunn, Meyer, and Urquhart. The development of paraconsistent logics (in the form\nof relevant logics) was transported to Australia. R. Routley (later\nSylvan) and V. Routley (later Plumwood) discovered an intentional\nsemantics for some of Anderson/Belnap relevant logics. A school\ndeveloped around them in Canberra which included Brady and Mortensen,\nand later Priest who, together with R. Routley, incorporated\ndialetheism to the development.\n\nSince the 1970s, the development of paraconsistent logic has been\ninternational. Some of the major schools of thought are canvassed\nbelow, including adaptive logic (as in Batens 2001) and\npreservationism (as in Schotch, Brown, & Jennings 2009). There is\nwork being done in in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,\nthe Czech Republic, England, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico,\nNew Zealand, Poland, Scotland, Spain, the United States, and more.\nThere has been a series of major international conferences about\nparaconsistent logic. In 1997, the First World Congress on\nParaconsistency was held at the University of Ghent in Belgium. The\nSecond World Congress was held in S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o\n(S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) in 2000, the Third in Toulous (France) in\n2003 and the Fourth in Melbourne (Australia) in 2008. A Fifth World\nCongress was held in Kolkata, India in 2013. Another major\nparaconsistency conference in 2014 was held in Munich (Andreas &\nVerd\u00e9e 2016). See the bibliography section on World Congress\nProceedings.\n2. Motivations\n\nThe reasons for paraconsistency that have been put forward are\nspecific to the development of the particular formal systems of\nparaconsistent logic. However, there are several general reasons for\nthinking that logic should be paraconsistent. Before we summarise the\nsystems of paraconsistent logic, we present some motivations for\nparaconsistent logic.\n2.1 Inconsistency without Triviality\n\nA most telling reason for paraconsistent logic is, prima facie, the\nfact that there are theories which are inconsistent but non-trivial.\nIf we admit the existence of such theories, their underlying logics\nmust be paraconsistent (though see Michael 2016).\n2.1.1 Non-Trivial Theories\n\nExamples of apparently inconsistent but non-trivial theories are easy to produce.\nOne example can be derived from the history of science. Consider\nBohr\u2019s theory of the atom. According to this, an electron orbits\nthe nucleus of the atom without radiating energy. However, according\nto Maxwell\u2019s equations, which formed an integral part of the\ntheory, an electron which is accelerating in orbit must radiate\nenergy. Hence Bohr\u2019s account of the behaviour of the atom was\ninconsistent. Yet, patently, not everything concerning the behavior of\nelectrons was inferred from it, nor should it have been. Hence,\nwhatever inference mechanism it was that underlay it, arguably this must have\nbeen paraconsistent (Brown & Priest 2015).\n2.1.2 True Contradictions\n\nDespite the fact that dialetheism and paraconsistency must be\ndistinguished, dialetheism can be a motivation for paraconsistent\nlogic. One candidate for a dialetheia (a true contradiction) is the\n liar paradox.\n Consider the sentence: \u2018This sentence is not true\u2019. There\nare two options: either the sentence is true or it is not. Suppose it\nis true. Then what it says is the case. Hence the sentence is not\ntrue. Suppose, on the other hand, it is not true. This is what it\nsays. Hence the sentence is true. In either case it is both true and\nnot true. (See the entry on\n dialetheism.)\n2.1.3 Linguistics\n\nNatural languages are another possible site of non-trivial\ninconsistency. In linguistics, it has been observed that normal\nlexical features are preserved even in inconsistent contexts. For\nexample, words like \u2018near\u2019 have spatial connotations that\nare not disturbed even when dealing with impossible objects (McGinnis\n2013):\n\n\nIf I tell you that I painted a spherical cube brown, you take its\nexterior to be brown \u2026, and if I am inside it, you know I am\nnot near it. (Chomsky 1995: 20)\n\n\nHence if natural language can be said to have a logic, paraconsistent\nlogics could be a candidate for formalizing it.\n2.2 Artificial Intelligence\n\nParaconsistent logic is motivated not only by philosophical\nconsiderations, but also by its applications and implications.\n2.2.1 Automated Reasoning\n\nOne of the applications is automated reasoning\n(information processing). Consider a computer which stores a\nlarge amount of information, as in Belnap 1992. While the computer\nstores the information, it is also used to operate on it, and,\ncrucially, to infer from it. Now it is quite common for the computer\nto contain inconsistent information, because of mistakes by the data\nentry operators or because of multiple sourcing. This is certainly a\nproblem for database operations with theorem-provers, and so has drawn\nmuch attention from computer scientists. Techniques for removing\ninconsistent information have been investigated. Yet all have limited\napplicability, and, in any case, are not guaranteed to produce\nconsistency. (There is no general algorithm for logical falsehood.) Hence,\neven if steps are taken to get rid of contradictions when they are\nfound, an underlying paraconsistent logic is desirable if hidden\ncontradictions are not to generate spurious answers to queries.\n\nNelson\u2019s paraconsistent (four-valued) logic N4 has been\nspecifically studied for applications in computer science (Kamide\n& Wansing 2012). Annotated logics were proposed by Subrahmanian\n(1987) and then by da Costa, Subrahmanian, and Vago (1991); these\ntools are now being extended to robotics, expert systems for medical\ndiagnosis, and engineering, with recent work gathered in the volumes\nedited by Abe, Akama, and Nakamatsu (2015) and Akama (2016).\n2.2.2 Belief Revision\n\nBelief revision\n is the study of rationally revising bodies of belief in the light of\nnew evidence. Notoriously, people have inconsistent beliefs. They may\neven be rational in doing so. For example, there may be apparently\noverwhelming evidence for both something and its negation. There may\neven be cases where it is in principle impossible to eliminate such\ninconsistency. For example, consider the \u2018paradox of the\npreface\u2019. A rational person, after thorough research, writes a\nbook in which they claim \\(A_1\\),\u2026, \\(A_n\\). But they are also\naware that no book of any complexity contains only truths. So they\nrationally believe \\(\\neg(A_1 \\wedge \\ldots \\wedge A_n)\\) too. Hence,\nprinciples of rational belief revision must work on inconsistent sets\nof beliefs. Standard accounts of belief revision, e.g. the AGM theory\n(see\n the logic of belief revision),\n all fail to do this, since they are based on classical logic (Tanaka\n2005). A more adequate account may be based on a paraconsistent logic;\nsee Girard and Tanaka 2016.\n2.3 Formal Semantics and Set Theory\n\nParaconsistency can be taken as a response to\n logical paradoxes\n in formal semantics and set theory.\n2.3.1 Truth Theory\n\nSemantics is the study that aims to spell out a theoretical\nunderstanding of meaning. Most accounts of semantics insist that to\nspell out the meaning of a sentence is, in some sense, to spell out\nits truth-conditions. Now, prima facie at least, truth is a\npredicate characterised by the Tarski T-scheme: \n\n\\[\nT(\\boldsymbol{A}) \\leftrightarrow A\n\\]\n\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is a sentence and \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is its name. But\ngiven any standard means of self-reference, e.g., arithmetisation, one\ncan construct a sentence, \\(B\\), which says that \\(\\neg\nT(\\boldsymbol{B})\\). The T-scheme gives that \\(T(\\boldsymbol{B})\n\\leftrightarrow \\neg T(\\boldsymbol{B})\\). It then follows that\n\\(T(\\boldsymbol{B}) \\wedge \\neg T(\\boldsymbol{B})\\). (This is, of\ncourse, just the\n liar paradox.)\n A full development of a theory of truth in paraconsistent logic is\ngiven by Beall (2009); for more general details see Beall et al 2018.\n2.3.2 Set Theory\n\nThe situation is similar in set theory. The naive, and arguably intuitively\ncorrect, axioms of set theory are the Comprehension Schema\nand Extensionality Principle: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\exists y\\forall x(x \\in y \\leftrightarrow A) \\\\\n& \\forall x(x \\in y \\leftrightarrow x \\in z) \\rightarrow y = z\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nAs was discovered by Russell, any theory that contains the Comprehension Schema is\ninconsistent. For putting \u2018\\(y \\not\\in y\\)\u2019 for \\(A\\) in\nthe Comprehension Schema and instantiating the existential quantifier\nto an arbitrary such object \u2018\\(r\\)\u2019 gives: \n\n\\[\n\\forall y(y \\in r \\leftrightarrow y \\not\\in y)\n\\]\n\n\nSo, instantiating the universal quantifier to \u2018\\(r\\)\u2019\ngives: \n\n\\[\nr \\in r \\leftrightarrow r \\not\\in r\n\\]\n\n\nIt then follows that \\(r \\in r \\wedge r \\not\\in r\\).\n\nThe standard approaches to these problems of inconsistency are, by and\nlarge, ones of expedience. A paraconsistent approach makes it possible\nto have theories of truth and sethood in which the mathematically\nfundamental intuitions about these notions are respected. For example,\nas Brady (1989; 2006) has shown, contradictions may be allowed to\narise in a paraconsistent set theory, but these need not infect the\nwhole theory.\n\nThere are several approaches to set theory with naive comprehension\nvia paraconsistent logic. Models for paraconsistent set theory are described by Libert (2005). The theories of ordinal and cardinal numbers are developed axiomatically using relevant logic in Weber 2010b, 2012.\nThe possibility of adding a consistency operator to track\nnon-paradoxical fragments of the theory is considered in Omori 2015,\ntaking a cue from the tradition of da Costa. Naive set theory using\nadaptive logic is presented by Verd\u00e9e (2013); see Batens 2020 for current developments in adaptive Fregean Set Theory.\nIncurvati (2020, chapter 4) gives a detailed critique of the paraconsistent approach to naive set theory. Recent work in algebra-valued models of paraconsistent set theory  gets away from naive set theory and is about placing the axioms of standard Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZF) in a paraconsistent framework. Algebraic models along these lines are being vigorously investigated by Tarafder, Venturi, and Jockwich (see Jockwich and Venturi 2021), following L\u00f6we and Tarafder 2015.\n2.3.3 Mathematics in general\n\nAccording to da Costa (1974: 498),\n\n\nIt would be as interesting to study the inconsistent systems as, for\ninstance, the non-euclidean geometries: we would obtain a better idea\nof the nature of paradoxes, could have a better insight on the\nconnections amongst the various logical principles necessary to obtain\ndeterminate results, etc. \u2026 It is not our aim to eliminate the\ninconsistencies, but to analyze and study them.\n\n\nA recent step in this direction is in Weber 2021. For further developments of mathematics in paraconsistent logics, see\nentry on\n inconsistent mathematics.\n2.4 Arithmetic and G\u00f6del\u2019s Theorem\n\nUnlike formal semantics and set theory, there may not be any obvious\narithmetical principles that give rise to contradiction. Nonetheless,\njust like the classical non-standard models of arithmetic, there is a\nclass of inconsistent models of arithmetic (or more\naccurately models of inconsistent arithmetic) which have an\ninteresting and important mathematical structure.\n\nOne interesting implication of the existence of inconsistent models of\narithmetic is that some of them are finite (unlike the classical\nnon-standard models). This means that there are some significant\napplications in the metamathematical theorems. For example, the\nclassical L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem states that \\(Q\\)\n(Robinson\u2019s arithmetic which is a fragment of Peano arithmetic)\nhas models of every infinite cardinality but has no finite models.\nBut, \\(Q\\) can be shown to have models of finite size too by referring\nto the inconsistent models of arithmetic.\n\nIt is not only the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem but also other\nmetamathematical theorems can be given a paraconsistent treatment. In\nthe case of other theorems, however, the negative results that are\noften shown by the limitative theorems of metamathematics may no\nlonger hold. One important such theorem is G\u00f6del\u2019s theorem.\n\nOne version of G\u00f6del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem states\nthat for any consistent axiomatic theory of arithmetic, which can be\nrecognised to be sound, there will be an arithmetic truth\u2014viz.,\nits G\u00f6del sentence\u2014not provable in it, but which can be\nestablished as true by intuitively correct reasoning. The heart of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem is, in fact, a paradox that concerns the\nsentence, \\(G\\), \u2018This sentence is not provable\u2019. If \\(G\\)\nis provable, then it is true and so not provable. Thus \\(G\\) is\nproved. Hence \\(G\\) is true and so unprovable. If an underlying\nparaconsistent logic is used to formalise the arithmetic, and the\ntheory therefore allowed to be inconsistent, the G\u00f6del sentence\nmay well be provable in the theory (essentially by the above\nreasoning). So a paraconsistent approach to arithmetic overcomes the\nlimitations of arithmetic that are supposed (by many) to follow from\nG\u00f6del\u2019s theorem. For other \u2018limitative\u2019\ntheorems of metamathematics, see Priest 2002. For some of the original work by Meyer applying paraconsistent logic to arithmetic, and new commentaries and developments, see the collection Ferguson and Priest 2021.\n2.5 Vagueness\n\nFrom the start, paraconsistent logics were intended in part to deal\nwith problems of vagueness and the\n sorites paradox\n (Ja\u015bkowski 1948 [1969]). Some empirical evidence suggest that\nvagueness in natural language is a good candidate for paraconsistent\ntreatment (Ripley 2011).\n\nA few different paraconsistent approaches to vagueness have been\nsuggested. Subvaluationism is the logical dual to\nsupervaluationism: if a claim is true on some acceptable\nsharpening of a vague predicate, then it is true. Where the\nsupervaluationist sees indeterminacy, or truth-value gaps, the\nsubvaluationist sees overdeterminacy, truth-value gluts. A\nsubvaluation logic will, like its supervaluational dual, preserve all\nclassical tautologies, as long as the definition of validity is\nrestricted to the non-glutty cases. Because it is so structurally\nsimilar to supervaluationism, subvaluationism is also subject to most\nof the same criticisms (Hyde 1997).\n\nMore broadly, (dialetheic) paraconsistency has been used in\nstraightforward three-valued truth-functional approaches to vagueness.\nThe aim is to preserve both of the following intuitive claims:\n\nTolerance: For vague \\(F\\), it is not the case that\n\\(x\\) is \\(F\\) but some very \\(F\\)-similar \\(x\\) is not \\(F\\) \nCutoffs: For all \\(F\\), if some \\(x\\) is \\(F\\) and some\n\\(y\\) is not, and there is an ordered \\(F\\)-progression from \\(x\\) to\n\\(y\\), then there is some last \\(F\\) and some first non-\\(F\\) \n\n\nAgain, the key to the analysis is to take cutoffs as sites for\ninconsistency, for objects both F and not F. Then all tolerance claims\n(about vague F) are taken as true; but since, paraconsistently, the\ninference of disjunctive syllogism is not generally valid, these\nclaims do not imply absurdities like \u2018everyone is bald\u2019.\nParaconsistent models place a great deal of emphasis on cutoff points\nof vague predicates, attributing much of the trouble with the sorties\nparadox to underlying inconsistency of vague predicates (Weber 2010a).\n\nThere is debate as to whether the sorties paradox is of a kind with\nthe other well-known semantic and set theoretic paradoxes, like\nRussell\u2019s and the liar. If it is, then a paraconsistent approach\nto one would be as natural as to the other.\n3. Systems of Paraconsistent Logic\n\nA number of formal techniques to invalidate ECQ have been devised.\nAs the interest in paraconsistent logic grew, different\ntechniques developed in different parts of the world. As a result, the\ndevelopment of the techniques has somewhat a regional flavour (though\nthere are, of course, exceptions, and the regional differences can be\nover-exaggerated; see Tanaka 2003). Some of these have been summarised in Brown 2002 and\nPriest 2002. The list of systems canvassed here is by no means exhaustive and will be expanded in future updates.\n\nMost paraconsistent logicians do not propose a wholesale rejection of\nclassical logic. They usually accept the validity of classical\ninferences in consistent contexts. It is the need to isolate an\ninconsistency without spreading everywhere that motivates the\nrejection of ECQ. Depending on how much revision one thinks is needed,\nwe have a technique for paraconsistency. The taxonomy given here is\nbased on the degree of revision to classical logic. (On comparing paraconsistent logics based on proximity to classical logic, see Arieli, Avron and Zamansky (2011) and for more methodological concerns Wansing and Odinstov (2016).) Since the logical novelty can be seen at the propositional level, we will concentrate on\nthe propositional paraconsistent logics.\n3.1 Discussive Logic\n\nThe first formal paraconsistent logic to have been developed was\ndiscussive (or discursive) logic by the\nPolish logician Ja\u015bkowski (1948). The thought behind discussive\nlogic is that, in a discourse, each participant puts forward some\ninformation, beliefs or opinions. Each assertion is true according to\nthe participant who puts it forward in a discourse. But what is true\nin a discourse on whole is the sum of assertions put forward by\nparticipants. Each participant\u2019s opinions may be\nself-consistent, yet may be inconsistent with those of others.\nJa\u015bkowski formalised this idea in the form of discussive\nlogic.\n\nA formalisation of discussive logic is by means of modelling a\ndiscourse in a modal logic. For simplicity, Ja\u015bkowski chose\nS5. We think of each participant\u2019s belief set as the\nset of sentences true at a world in an S5 model \\(M\\). Thus,\na sentence \\(A\\) asserted by a participant in a discourse is\ninterpreted as \u201cit is possible that \\(A\\)\u201d or a sentence\n\\(\\Diamond A\\) of S5. Then \\(A\\) holds in a discourse iff\n\\(A\\) is true at some world in \\(M\\). Since \\(A\\) may hold in one\nworld but not in another, both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) may hold in a\ndiscourse. Indeed, one should expect that participants disagree on\nsome issue in a rational discourse. The idea, then, is that \\(B\\) is a\ndiscussive consequence of \\(A_1, \\ldots, A_n\\) iff \\(\\Diamond B\\) is\nan S5 consequence of \\(\\Diamond A_{1} \\ldots \\Diamond\nA_{n}\\).\n\nTo see that discussive logic is paraconsistent, consider an\nS5 model, \\(M\\), such that \\(A\\) holds at \\(w_1\\), \\(\\neg A\\)\nholds at a different world \\(w_2\\), but \\(B\\) does not hold at any\nworld for some \\(B\\). Then both \\(A\\) and \\(\\neg A\\) hold, yet \\(B\\)\ndoes not hold in \\(M\\). Hence discussive logic invalidates ECQ.\n\nHowever, there is no S5 model where \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) holds\nat some world. So an inference of the form \\(\\{A \\wedge \\neg A\\}\n\\vDash B\\) is valid in discussive logic. This means that, in\ndiscussive logic, adjunction \\((\\{A, \\neg A\\} \\vDash A \\wedge\n\\neg A)\\) fails. But one can define a discussive conjunction,\n\\(\\wedge_d\\), as \\(A \\wedge \\Diamond B\\) (or \\(\\Diamond A \\wedge B)\\).\nThen adjunction holds for \\(\\wedge_d\\) (Ja\u015bkowski 1949).\n\nOne difficulty is a formulation of a conditional. In S5, the\ninference from \\(\\Diamond p\\) and \\(\\Diamond(p \\supset q)\\) to\n\\(\\Diamond q\\) fails. Ja\u015bkowski chose to introduce a connective\nwhich he called discussive implication, \\(\\supset_d\\),\ndefined as \\(\\Diamond A \\supset B\\). This connective can be understood\nto mean that \u201cif some participant states that \\(A\\), then\n\\(B\\)\u201d. As the inference from \\(\\Diamond A \\supset B\\) and\n\\(\\Diamond A\\) to \\(\\Diamond B\\) is valid in S5, modus\nponens for \\(\\supset_d\\) holds in discussive logic. A discussive\nbi-implication, \\(\\equiv_d\\), can also be defined as \\((\\Diamond A\n\\supset B) \\wedge \\Diamond(\\Diamond B \\supset A)\\) (or\n\\(\\Diamond(\\Diamond A \\supset B) \\wedge (\\Diamond B \\supset A))\\). For\nsome history of work on Ja\u015bkowski\u2019s logic and\naxiomatizations thereof, see Omori and Alama (2018).\n3.2 Non-Adjunctive Systems\n\nA non-adjunctive system is a system that does not validate adjunction\n(i.e., \\(\\{A, B\\} \\not\\vDash A \\wedge B)\\). As we saw above,\ndiscussive logic without a discussive conjunction is non-adjunctive.\nAnother non-adjunctive strategy was suggested by Rescher and Manor\n(1970). In effect, we can conjoin premises, but only up to maximal\nconsistency. Specifically, if \\(\\Sigma\\) is a set of premises, a\nmaximally consistent subset is any consistent subset \\(\\Sigma '\\) such\nthat if \\(A \\in \\Sigma - \\Sigma '\\) then \\(\\Sigma ' \\cup \\{A\\}\\) is\ninconsistent. Then we say that \\(A\\) is a consequence of \\(\\Sigma\\)\niff \\(A\\) is a classical consequence of \\(\\Sigma '\\) for some\nmaximally consistent subset \\(\\Sigma '\\). Then \\(\\{p, q\\} \\vDash p\n\\wedge q\\) but \\(\\{p, \\neg p\\} \\not\\vDash p \\wedge \\neg p\\).\n3.3 Preservationism\n\nIn the non-adjunctive system of Rescher and Manor, a consequence\nrelation is defined over some maximally consistent subset of the\npremises. This can be seen as a way to \u2018measure\u2019 the\nlevel of consistency in the premise set. The level of \\(\\{p,\nq\\}\\) is 1 since the maximally consistent subset is the set itself.\nThe level of \\(\\{p, \\neg p\\}\\), however, is 2: \\(\\{p\\}\\) and \\(\\{\\neg\np\\}\\).\n\nIf we define a consequence relation over some maximally consistent\nsubset, then the relation can be thought of as preserving the level of\nconsistent fragments. This is the approach which has come to be called\npreservationism. It was first developed by the Canadian\nlogicians Ray Jennings and Peter Schotch.\n\nTo be more precise, a (finite) set of formulas, \\(\\Sigma\\), can be\npartitioned into classically consistent fragments whose union is\n\\(\\Sigma\\). Let \\(\\vdash\\) be the classical consequence relation. A\ncovering of \\(\\Sigma\\) is a set \\(\\{\\Sigma_i : i \\in I\\}\\),\nwhere each member is consistent, and \\(\\Sigma = \\bigcup_{i \\in I}\n\\Sigma_i\\). The level of \\(\\Sigma , l(\\Sigma)\\), is the least\n\\(n\\) such that \\(\\Sigma\\) can be partitioned into \\(n\\) sets if there\nis such \\(n\\), or \\(\\infty\\) if there is no such \\(n\\). A consequence\nrelation, called forcing, \\(\\Vdash\\), is defined as follows.\n\\(\\Sigma\\Vdash A\\) iff \\(l(\\Sigma) = \\infty\\), or \\(l(\\Sigma) = n\\)\nand for every covering of size \\(n\\) there is a \\(j \\in I\\) such that\n\\(\\Sigma_j \\vdash A\\). If \\(l(\\Sigma) = 1\\) or \\(\\infty\\) then the\nforcing relation coincides with classical consequence relation. In\ncase where \\(l(\\Sigma) = \\infty\\), there must be a sentence of the\nform \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) and so the forcing relation explodes.\n\nA chunking strategy has also been applied to capture the inferential\nmechanism underlying some theories in science and mathematics. In\nmathematics, the best available theory concerning infinitesimals was\ninconsistent. In the original calculus of Leibniz, in\nthe calculation of a derivative infinitesimals had to be both zero and\nnon-zero. (Cf. Colyvan 2012, chapter 7. Newton used \u2018fluxions\u2019, which play a similar role.) In order to capture the inference mechanism underlying this (and Bohr\u2019s theory\nof the atom), we need to add to the chunking a mechanism that allows a\nlimited amount of information to flow between the consistent fragments\nof these inconsistent but non-trivial theories. That is, certain\ninformation from one chunk may permeate into other chunks. The\ninference procedure underlying the theories must be Chunk and\nPermeate.\n\nLet \\(C = \\{\\Sigma_i : i \\in I\\}\\) and \\(\\varrho\\) a permeability\nrelation on \\(C\\) such that \\(\\varrho\\) is a map from \\(I \\times I\\)\nto subsets of formulas of the language. If \\(i_0 \\in I\\), then any\nstructure \\(\\langle C, \\varrho , i_0\\rangle\\) is called a C&P\nstructure on \\(\\Sigma\\). If \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) is a C&P structure on\n\\(\\Sigma\\), we define the C&P consequences of \\(\\Sigma\\) with\nrespect to \\(\\mathcal{B}\\), as follows. For each \\(i \\in I\\), a set of\nsentences, \\(\\Sigma_i^n\\), is defined by recursion on \\(n\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Sigma_i^{0} & = \\Sigma_i^{\\vdash} \\\\\n\\Sigma_i^{n+1} & = \\left( \\Sigma_i^n \\cup \\bigcup_{j \\in I} \\left(\\Sigma_j^n \\cap \\rho(j,i)\\right)  \\right)^{\\vdash} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nThat is, \\(\\Sigma_i^{n+1}\\) comprises the consequences from\n\\(\\Sigma_i^n\\) together with the information that permeates into chunk\n\\(i\\) from the other chunk at level \\(n\\). We then collect up all\nfinite stages: \n\n\\[\n\\Sigma_i^{\\omega} = \\bigcup_{n \\lt \\omega} \\Sigma_i^n\n\\]\n\n\nThe C&P consequences of \\(\\Sigma\\) can be defined in terms of the\nsentences that can be inferred in the designated chunk \\(i_0\\) when\nall appropriate information has been allowed to flow along the\npermeability relations (see Brown & Priest 2004, 2015.)\n3.4 Adaptive Logics\n\nOne may think not only that an inconsistency needs to be isolated but\nalso that a serious need for the consideration of inconsistencies is a\nrare occurrence. The thought may be that consistency is the norm until\nproven otherwise: we should treat a sentence or a theory as\nconsistently as possible. This is essentially the motivation for\nadaptive logics, pioneered by Diderik Batens in Belgium.\n\nAn adaptive logic is a logic that adapts itself to the situation at\nthe time of application of inference rules. It models the dynamics of\nour reasoning. There are two senses in which reasoning is dynamic:\nexternal and internal. Reasoning is externally dynamic if as\nnew information becomes available expanding the premise set,\nconsequences inferred previously may have to be withdrawn. The\nexternal dynamics is thus the non-monotonic character of some\nconsequence relations: \\(\\Gamma \\vdash A\\) and \\(\\Gamma \\cup \\Delta\n\\not\\vdash A\\) for some \\(\\Gamma , \\Delta\\) and \\(A\\). However, even\nif the premise-set remains constant, some previously inferred\nconclusion may be considered as not derivable at a later stage. As our\nreasoning proceeds from a premise set, we may encounter a situation\nwhere we infer a consequence provided that no abnormality, in\nparticular no contradiction, obtains at some stage of the reasoning\nprocess. If we are forced to infer a contradiction at a later stage,\nour reasoning has to adapt itself so that an application of the\npreviously used inference rule is withdrawn. In such a case, reasoning\nis internally dynamic. Our reasoning may be internally\ndynamic if the set of valid inferences is not recursively enumerable\n(i.e., there is no decision procedure that leads to \u2018yes\u2019\nafter finitely many steps if the inference is indeed valid). It is the\ninternal dynamics that adaptive logics are devised to capture.\n\nIn order to illustrate the idea behind adaptive logics, consider the\npremise set \\(\\Gamma = \\{p, \\neg p \\vee r, \\neg r \\vee s, \\neg s, s\n\\vee t\\}\\). One may start reasoning with \\(\\neg s\\) and \\(s \\vee t\\),\nusing the Disjunctive Syllogism (DS) to infer \\(t\\), given that \\(s\n\\wedge \\neg s\\) does not obtain. We then reason with \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg\np \\vee r\\), to infer \\(r\\) with the DS, given that \\(p \\wedge \\neg p\\)\ndoes not obtain. Now, we can apply the DS to \\(\\neg r \\vee s\\) and\n\\(r\\) to derive \\(s\\), provided that \\(r \\wedge \\neg r\\) does not\nobtain. However, by conjoining \\(s\\) and \\(\\neg s\\), we can obtain \\(s\n\\wedge \\neg s\\). Hence we must withdraw the first application of DS,\nand so the proof of \\(t\\) lapses. A consequence of this reasoning is\nwhat cannot be defeated at any stage of the process.\n\nA system of adaptive logic can generally be characterised as\nconsisting of three elements:\n\nA lower limit logic (LLL)\nA set of abnormalities\nAn adaptive strategy\n\n\nLLL is the part of an adaptive logic that is not subject to\nadaptation. It consists essentially of a number of inferential rules\n(and/or axioms) that one is happy to accept regardless of the\nsituation in a reasoning process. A set of abnormalities is a set of\nformulas that are presupposed as not holding (or as absurd) at the\nbeginning of reasoning until they are shown to be otherwise. For many\nadaptive logics, a formula in this set is of the form \\(A \\wedge \\neg\nA\\). An adaptive strategy specifies a strategy of handling the\napplications of inference rules based on the set of abnormalities. If\nLLL is extended with the requirement that no abnormality is logically\npossible, one obtains the upper limit logic (ULL). ULL essentially\ncontains not only the inferential rules (and/or axioms) of LLL but\nalso supplementary rules (and/or axioms) that can be applied in the\nabsence of abnormality, such as DS. By specifying these three\nelements, one obtains a system of adaptive logic.\n3.5 Logics of Formal Inconsistency\n\nThe approaches taken for motivating the systems of paraconsistent\nlogic which we have so far seen isolate inconsistency from consistent\nparts of the given theory. The aim is to retain as much classical\nmachinery as possible in developing a system of paraconsistent logic\nwhich, nonetheless, avoids explosion when faced with a contradiction.\nOne way to make this aim explicit is to extend the expressive power of\nour language by encoding the metatheoretical notions of consistency\n(and inconsistency) in the object language. The Logics of Formal\nInconsistency (LFIs) are a family of paraconsistent\nlogics that constitute consistent fragments of classical logic yet\nwhich reject the explosion principle where a contradiction is present.\nThe investigation of this family of logics was initiated by Newton da\nCosta in Brazil.\n\nAn effect of encoding consistency (and inconsistency) in the object\nlanguage is that we can explicitly separate inconsistency from\ntriviality. With a language rich enough to express inconsistency (and\nconsistency), we can study inconsistent theories without assuming that\nthey are necessarily trivial. This makes it explicit that the presence\nof a contradiction is a separate issue from the non-trivial nature of\nparaconsistent inferences.\n\nThe thought behind LFIs is that we should respect classical\nlogic as much as possible. It is only when there is a contradiction\nthat logic should deviate from it. This means that we can admit the\nvalidity of ECQ in the absence of contradictions. In order to do so,\nwe encode \u2018consistency\u2019 into our object language by\n\\(\\circ\\). Then \\(\\vdash\\) is a consequence relation of an\nLFI iff\n\n\\(\\exists \\Gamma \\exists A\\exists B(\\Gamma , A, \\neg A \\not\\vdash\nB)\\) and \n\\(\\forall \\Gamma \\forall A\\forall B(\\Gamma, \\circ A, A, \\neg A\n\\vdash B)\\).\n\n\nLet \\(\\vdash_C\\) be the classical consequence (or derivability)\nrelation and \\(\\circ (\\Gamma)\\) express the consistency of the set of\nformulas \\(\\Gamma\\) such that if \\(\\circ A\\) and \\(\\circ B\\) then\n\\(\\circ (A * B)\\) where \\(*\\) is any two place logical connective.\nThen we can capture derivability in the consistent context in terms of\nthe equivalence: \\(\\forall \\Gamma \\forall B\\exists \\Delta(\\Gamma\n\\vdash_C B\\) iff \\(\\circ (\\Delta), \\Gamma \\vdash B)\\).\n\nNow take the positive fragment of classical logic with modus\nponens plus double negation elimination \\((\\neg \\neg A\n\\rightarrow A)\\) as an axiom and some axioms governing \\(\\circ\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\circ A & \\rightarrow(A \\rightarrow(\\neg A \\rightarrow B)) \\\\\n(\\circ A \\wedge \\circ B) &\\rightarrow \\circ (A \\wedge B) \\\\\n(\\circ A \\rightarrow \\circ B) &\\rightarrow \\circ (A \\rightarrow B)\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nThen \\(\\vdash\\) provides da Costa\u2019s system \\(C_1\\). If we let\n\\(A^1\\) abbreviate the formula \\(\\neg(A \\wedge \\neg A)\\) and\n\\(A^{n+1}\\) the formula \\((\\neg(A^n \\wedge \\neg A^n ))^1\\), then we\nobtain \\(C_i\\) for each natural number \\(i\\) greater than 1.\n\nTo obtain da Costa\u2019s system \\(C_{\\omega}\\), instead of the\npositive fragment of classical logic, we start with positive\nintuitionist logic instead. \\(C_i\\) systems for finite \\(i\\) do not\nrule out \\((A^n \\wedge \\neg A^n \\wedge A^{n+1})\\) from holding in a\ntheory. By going up the hierarchy to \\(\\omega\\), \\(C_{\\omega}\\) rules\nout this possibility. Note, however, that \\(C_{\\omega}\\) is not a\nLFC as it does not contain classical positive logic.\nFor the semantics for da Costa\u2019s \\(C\\)-systems, see for example\nda Costa and Alves 1977 and Loparic 1977.\nThe LFIs are a powerful expansion of these ideas. A comprehensive overview and further work in this tradition is in Carnielli and Coniglio 2016. Further work on looking for consistency or recovery operators is in Barrio and Carnielli 2020.\n3.6 Many-Valued Logics\n\nPerhaps the simplest way of generating a paraconsistent logic, first\nproposed by Asenjo in his PhD dissertation, is to use a many-valued\nlogic. Classically, there are exactly two truth values. The\nmany-valued approach is to drop this classical assumption and allow\nmore than two truth values. The simplest strategy is to use three\ntruth values: true (only), false (only) and both\n(true and false) for the evaluations of formulas. The truth\ntables for logical connectives, except conditional, can be given as\nfollows:\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\neg\\)\n \n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(b\\)\n\\(b\\) \n\n\\(f\\)\n\\(t\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\wedge\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(b\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(f\\)\n\\(f\\)\n\\(f\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\vee\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\) \n\n\\(b\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(b\\) \n\n\\(f\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\n\n\nThese tables are essentially those of Kleene\u2019s and\n\u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s three valued logics where the middle value is\nthought of as indeterminate or neither (true nor\nfalse).\n\nFor a conditional \\(\\supset\\), following Kleene\u2019s strong three valued\nlogic, we might specify a truth table as follows:\n\n\n\n\\(\\supset\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(f\\) \n\n\\(b\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(b\\)\n\\(b\\) \n\n\\(f\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\)\n\\(t\\) \n\n\n\nLet \\(t\\) and \\(b\\) be the designated values. These are the\nvalues that are preserved in valid inferences. If we define a\nconsequence relation in terms of preservation of these designated\nvalues, then we have the paraconsistent logic LP (Priest\n1979). In LP, ECQ is invalid. To see this, we assign \\(b\\) to\n\\(p\\) and \\(f\\) to \\(q\\). Then \\(\\neg p\\) is also evaluated as \\(b\\)\nand so both \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg p\\) are designated. Yet \\(q\\) is not\nevaluated as having a designated value. Hence ECQ is invalid in\nLP.\n\nAs we can see, LP invalidates ECQ by assigning a designated\nvalue, both true and false, to a contradiction. Thus,\nLP departs from classical logic more so than the systems that\nwe have seen previously, and is often aligned with dialetheism. \nHowever, we can interpret truth\nvalues not in an aletheic sense but in an epistemic sense: truth\nvalues (or designated values) express epistemic or doxastic\ncommitments (see for example Belnap 1992). Or we might think that the\nvalue both is needed for a semantic reason: we might be\nrequired to express the contradictory nature of some of our beliefs,\nassertions and so on (see Dunn 1976: 157). If this interpretative\nstrategy is successful, we can separate LP from necessarily\nfalling under dialetheism.\n\nOne feature of LP which requires some attention is that in\nLP modus ponens comes out to be invalid. For if\n\\(p\\) is both true and false but \\(q\\) false (only), then \\(p \\supset\nq\\) is both true and false and hence is designated. So both \\(p\\) and\n\\(p \\supset q\\) are designated, yet the conclusion \\(q\\) is not. Hence\nmodus ponens for \\(\\supset\\) is invalid in LP. (One\nway to rectify the problem is to add an appropriate conditional\nconnective as we will see in the\n section on relevant logics.)\n\nAnother way to develop a many-valued paraconsistent logic is to think\nof an assignment of a truth value not as a function but as a\nrelation. Let \\(P\\) be the set of propositional parameters.\nThen an evaluation, \\(\\eta\\), is a subset of \\(P \\times \\{0, 1\\}\\). A\nproposition may only relate to 1 (true), it may only relate to 0\n(false), it may relate to both 1 and 0 or it may relate to neither 1\nnor 0. The evaluation is extended to a relation for all formulas by\nthe following recursive clauses: \n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\neg A\\eta 1 & \\textrm{ iff }A\\eta 0\\\\\n\\neg A\\eta 0 & \\textrm{ iff }A\\eta 1\\\\[1ex]\nA \\wedge B\\eta 1 & \\textrm{ iff }A\\eta 1\\textrm{ and }B\\eta 1\\\\\nA \\wedge B\\eta 0 & \\textrm{ iff }A\\eta 0\\textrm{ or }B\\eta 0\\\\[1ex]\nA \\vee B\\eta 1 & \\textrm{ iff }A\\eta 1\\textrm{ or }B\\eta 1\\\\\nA \\vee B\\eta 0 & \\textrm{ iff }A\\eta 0\\textrm{ and }B\\eta 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\nIf we define validity in terms of truth preservation under all\nrelational evaluations then we obtain First Degree Entailment\n(FDE) which is a fragment of relevant logics. These\nrelational semantics for FDE are due to Dunn 1976; cf. Omori and Wansing 2017.\nA different approach is explored through the idea of non-deterministic\nmatrices, studied by Avron and his collaborators (for example, Avron\n& Lev 2005).\n3.7 Relevant Logics\n\nThe approaches to paraconsistency we have examined above all focus on\nthe inevitable presence or the truth of some contradictions. A\nrejection of ECQ, in these approaches, depends on an analysis of the\npremises containing a contradiction. One might think that the real\nproblem with ECQ is not to do with the contradictory premises but to\ndo with the lack of connection between the premises and the\nconclusion. The thought is that the conclusion must be\nrelevant to the premises in a valid inference.\n\nRelevant logics\n were pioneered in order to study the relevance of the conclusion with\nrespect to the premises by Anderson and Belnap (1975) in Pittsburgh.\nAnderson and Belnap motivated the development of relevant logics using\nnatural deduction systems; yet they developed a family of relevant\nlogics in axiomatic systems. As development proceeded and was carried\nout also in Australia, more focus was given to the semantics.\n\nThe semantics for relevant logics were developed by Fine (1974),\nRoutley and Routley (1972), Routley and Meyer (1993) and Urquhart\n(1972). (There are also algebraic semantics; see for example Dunn\n& Restall 2002: 48ff.) Routley-Meyer semantics is based on\npossible-world semantics, which is the most studied semantics for\nrelevant logics, especially in Australasia. In this semantics,\nconjunction and disjunction behave in the usual way. But each world,\n\\(w\\), has an associate world, \\(w^*\\), and negation is evaluated in\nterms of \\(w^*: \\neg A\\) is true at \\(w\\) iff \\(A\\) is false, not at\n\\(w\\), but at \\(w^*\\). Thus, if \\(A\\) is true at \\(w\\), but false at\n\\(w^*\\), then \\(A \\wedge \\neg A\\) is true at \\(w\\). To obtain the\nstandard relevant logics, one needs to add the constraint that\n\\(w^{**} = w\\). As is clear, negation in these semantics is an\nintensional operator.\n\nThe primary concern with relevant logics is not so much with negation\nas with a conditional connective \\(\\rightarrow\\) (satisfying modus\nponens). In relevant logics, if \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is a logical\ntruth, then \\(A\\) is relevant to \\(B\\), in the sense that \\(A\\) and\n\\(B\\) share at least one propositional variable.\n\nSemantics for the relevant conditional are obtained by furnishing each\nRoutley-Meyer model with a ternary relation. In the\nsimplified semantics of Priest and Sylvan (1992) and Restall (1993,\n1995), worlds are divided into normal and non-normal. If \\(w\\) is a\nnormal world, \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true at \\(w\\) iff at all worlds\nwhere \\(A\\) is true, \\(B\\) is true. If \\(w\\) is non-normal, \\(A\n\\rightarrow B\\) is true at \\(w\\) iff for all \\(x, y\\), such that\n\\(Rwxy\\), if \\(A\\) is true at \\(x, B\\) is true at \\(y\\). If \\(B\\) is\ntrue at \\(x\\) but not at \\(y\\) where \\(Rwxy\\), then \\(B \\rightarrow\nB\\) is not true at \\(w\\). Then one can show that \\(A \\rightarrow (B\n\\rightarrow B)\\) is not a logical truth. (Validity is defined as truth\npreservation over normal worlds.) This gives the basic\nrelevant logic, \\(B\\). Stronger logics, such as the logic \\(R\\), are\nobtained by adding constraints on the ternary relation.\n\nThere are also versions of world-semantics for relevant logics based\non Dunn\u2019s relational semantics for FDE. Then negation\nis extensional. A conditional connective, now needs to be given both\ntruth and falsity conditions. So we have: \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is true\nat \\(w\\) iff for all \\(x, y\\), such that \\(Rwxy\\), if \\(A\\) is true at\n\\(x, B\\) is true at \\(y\\); and \\(A \\rightarrow B\\) is false at \\(w\\)\niff for some \\(x, y\\), such that \\(Rwxy\\), if \\(A\\) is true at \\(x,\nB\\) is false at \\(y\\). Adding various constraints on the ternary\nrelation provides stronger logics. However, these logics are not the\nstandard relevant logics developed by Anderson and Belnap. To obtain\nthe standard family of relevant logics, one needs neighbourhood frames\n(see Mares 2004). Further details can be found in the entry on\n relevant logics.\n",
