    "main_text": "Objecting to Locke on Personal Identity\n4. Personal Identity as Simple and Unanalyzable\n\n\nThose familiar with the contemporary literature on personal identity,\nwith its emphasis on the necessary and sufficient conditions under\nwhich a person remains identical over time, may wonder: if Reid holds\nthat memory is not the criterion of identity, and if Reid\u2019s substance\ndualism rules out bodily identity as a criterion of personal\nidentity, in what does personal identity consist? Reid\u2019s\nanswer is that identity cannot be accounted for in any terms other\nthan itself. This is neither quietism nor epistemic humility on Reid\u2019s\npart. Rather, Reid argues that the nature of personal\nidentity\u2014its simplicity and indivisibility\u2014rules out any\nreductive account that appeals to notions other than identity in\nexplaining how a person persists over time.\n\n\nReid holds that numerical identity is, strictly speaking,\nindefinable, but it can be contrasted with other relations, such as\ndiversity, similarity and dissimilarity (Essays, 263). It\nrequires a continued existence over time\u2014a duration\u2014and\nrequires that there be no two beginnings of existence. Because\nmental states are fleeting and non-continuous they cannot remain\nidentical over time. A mental state may be indistinguishable from\na previous mental state, but because mental states do not have a\ncontinued existence, no mental state at one time can be numerically\nidentical with another at a different time. As a result, persons\ncannot be identified with their thoughts, actions or feelings\n(Essays, 264). However, according to Reid, thoughts,\nactions, feelings and all other mental operations are had or performed\nby a subject that has a continued existence and that bears the same\nrelation to all them. The subject is an immaterial substance that\nthinks, acts and feels. According to Reid, this substantial self\nhas no parts\u2014it is indivisible\u2014which contributes to its\nresistance to reductive explanation. Reid appeals to\nLeibniz\u2019s notion of a monad to describe the\nindivisibility of this immaterial, substantial self (Essays,\n264).\n\n\nThough memory is not the metaphysical ground of personal identity,\nit provides first-personal evidence of it. Reid notes that the\nevidence we use to make judgments about our own pasts is different from\nthe evidence we use to make judgments about other people and their\npasts (Essays 266). Memory justifies first-personal\nreports about one\u2019s own witnessed past, while judgments of\nqualitative similarity justify third-personal statements about the\nidentities of other persons. I know that I was present at my\nwedding because I remember being there. I know that the man I\nlive with was at my wedding because he looks like the man I\nmarried.\n\n\nFirst-personal, memorial reports about one\u2019s own past are\neither true or false: if the memorial experience is a genuine episodic\nmemory, then it is impossible for it to testify falsely concerning\none\u2019s presence at the event remembered. This aspect of\nepisodic memory reports is often expressed by saying that they are\nimmune to error through misidentification. If the memorial\nexperience testifies falsely concerning one\u2019s presence at the\nevent remembered, then it cannot be an episodic memory. For\nexample, if I have an experience as of having been lost in a shopping\nmall as a child, but I was never lost, I cannot be said to remember\nhaving been lost, strictly speaking. The upshot is that\nfirst-personal memorial reports, if they are episodic memory reports,\nprovide certainty concerning one\u2019s presence at the event\nremembered. Because third-personal judgments about the pasts of\nother persons are based on judgments of qualitative similarity rather\nthan episodic memory, they are never certain; they are only ever more\nor less well justified (Essays 264\u2013265).\n\n\nIt is important to notice that while Reid uses the term\n\u2018evidence,\u2019 when describing the role that memory plays in\nfirst-personal knowledge of one\u2019s own past, memory is not\nused by persons to justify judgments or beliefs about their\nown pasts. In other words, people do not remember events and then\nconclude from having remembered them, that it was\nthey who were witness to the events. Rather, memory\nitself represents one\u2019s presence at the event remembered.\nAccording to Reid, a memory consists in a conception of an event and a\nbelief, about the event conceived, that it happened to me, where the\npronoun is indexed to the person who is represented in the memory as\nagent or witness. In other words, memory consists in part in a\njudgment that represents one\u2019s presence at the event. Any\nfurther judgment, justified by memory, to the effect that I\nwas the person who was there would be superfluous\u2014memory\nalready testifies to my having been there. This is why Reid calls\nthe evidence of memory immediate: first-personal statements\nabout one\u2019s own past are memory statements, not statements made\non the basis of memory.\n\n\nReid\u2019s picture is one on which each of us is immediately and\njustifiably aware of our own past because each of us remembers\nhaving been there. This is the moral of the story concerning the\nlogical relationship between the concept of memory and the concept of\npersonal identity. Memories do not make me the same\nperson as the person represented in my memories. Rather, memories\nallow me to know my own past, immediately and directly.\n",
