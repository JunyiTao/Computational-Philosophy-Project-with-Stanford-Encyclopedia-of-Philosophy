    "main_text": "Features and ontological categories || Ontological categories\n2.2 Ontological categories: bearers and relata\n\nThough paradigm cases of determination (involving color,\nshape, mass, and so on) appear to hold between\nmonadic property types, it is straightforward to extend the notion to\nrelations, as in suggestions (see Mellor 1998 and French 2014) that\nlaws of nature are or are constituted by determinable relations\n (see \u00a75.1).\n Hence Johansson says that while the restriction to monadic types is\n\u2018traditional\u2019,\n\n\nI do not think there are any good reasons for the restriction.\n[\u2026] Relational concepts, just like property concepts, can be\nfitted into determinable-determinate trees. (2000: 117)\n\n\nGiven that determinables are properties (including relations), the\nquestion (what Meinertsen [2021] dubs \u201cMellor\u2019s\nquestion\u201d, following discussion in Mellor [1995], Ch. 16) arises\nof what determinables are properties of. It is commonly assumed that\ndeterminables, like determinates, are properties of particulars (and\nmoreover, of the same particular\u2014though certain applications of\ndetermination may depart from this assumption;\n see \u00a75.3),\n such that, e.g., the table is shaped as well as rectangular. But it\nhas also been maintained that determinables are second-order\nproperties\u2014that is, properties of associated determinates (see\nMellor 1995: 208; for a precursor see Prior 1949). See Meinertsen 2021\nfor a pro-particularist comparative assessment.\n\nMore controversially, determination has been taken to hold between\nentities of ontological (including representational) categories going\nbeyond properties and relations.\n\nTo start, as above, historical discussion of determinables and\ndeterminates (in, e.g., Johnson 1921) moves fairly freely between talk\nof these as representational (linguistic/conceptual) and as\nmetaphysical. In some such cases, the target is plausibly a properly\nmetaphysical\n distinction.[9]\n In other cases\u2014e.g., in empiricist treatments\u2014the\ncharacterization of determination in representational terms is clearly\nintended to be metaphysically deflationary. We will later revisit\nreasons for and against taking determinables or determination at\nmetaphysical face value\n (\u00a73.1,\n \u00a73.2).\n\nModulo deflationary concerns, there does not appear to be any\nin-principle barrier to allowing that determination can hold between\nentities of other\n categories.[10]\n Determination has been extended to actions or episodes (see, e.g.,\nMulligan 1992 and Cruse 1995: Ch. 6), events (Yablo 1992), fields (von\nWachter 2000), tropes (Funkhouser 2006), states (Fine 2011), and\nsubstances (Massin 2013). That said, one might maintain (either on\ngrounds of systematicity or parsimony, or as reflecting independent\ncommitment to a view of determinables as properties, as above) that\ndetermination as holding between entities of other categories is\nultimately a matter of these falling under or being partly constituted\nby determinable and determinate properties. Whatever one\u2019s\nposition on which ontological categories the relata of determination\ncan fall under, there are (as per metaphysical usual) different\navailable understandings of the categories at\n issue.[11]\n\nAnother question pertaining to ontological categories concerns whether\nsome or all specification relations are themselves determinates of a\nmore general relation determinable (see Johansson 2000: sec. 8 for\nendorsement of such a view).\n",
