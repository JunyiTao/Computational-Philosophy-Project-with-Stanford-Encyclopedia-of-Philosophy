    "main_text": "Unfinished Work\n9. Alan Turing: the Unknown Mind\n\n\nIt is a pity that Turing did not write more about his ethical\nphilosophy and world outlook. As a student he was an admirer of Bernard\nShaw's plays of ideas, and to friends would openly voice both the\nhilarities and frustrations of his many difficult situations. Yet the\nnearest he came to serious personal writing, apart from occasional\ncomments in private letters, was in penning a short story about his\n1952 crisis (Hodges 1983, p. 448). His last two years were particularly\nfull of Shavian drama and Wildean irony. In one letter (to his friend\nNorman Routledge; the letter is now in the Turing Archive at King's\nCollege, Cambridge) he wrote: \nTuring believes machines think\n\n Turing lies with men\n\n Therefore machines do not think\n\n\nThe syllogistic allusion to Socrates is unmistakeable, and his\ndemise, with cyanide rather than hemlock, may have signalled something\nsimilar. A parallel figure in World War II, Robert Oppenheimer,\nsuffered the loss of his reputation during the same week that Turing\ndied. Both combined the purest scientific work and the most effective\napplication of science in war. Alan Turing was even more directly on\nthe receiving end of science, when his sexual mind was treated as a\nmachine, against his protesting consciousness and will. But amidst all\nthis human drama, he left little to say about what he really thought of\nhimself and his relationship to the world of human events.\n\n\nAlan Turing did not fit easily with any of the intellectual movements\nof his time, aesthetic, technocratic or marxist. In the 1950s,\ncommentators struggled to find discreet words to categorise him: as\n\u2018a scientific Shelley,\u2019 as possessing great \u2018moral\nintegrity\u2019. Until the 1970s, the reality of his life was\nunmentionable. He is still hard to place within twentieth-century\nthought. He exalted the science that according to existentialists had\nrobbed life of meaning. The most original figure, the most insistent\non personal freedom, he held originality and will to be susceptible to\nmechanisation. The mind of Alan Turing continues to be an\nenigma.\n\n\nBut it is an enigma to which the twenty-first century seems\nincreasingly drawn. The year of his centenary, 2012, witnessed\nnumerous conferences, publications, and cultural events in his\nhonor. Some reasons for this explosion of interest are obvious. One is\nthat the question of the power and limitations of computation now\narises in virtually every sphere of human activity. Another is that\nissues of sexual orientation have taken on a new importance in modern\ndemocracies. More subtly, the interdisciplinary breadth of Turing's\nwork is now better appreciated. A landmark of the centenary period was\nthe publication of Alan Turing, his work and impact\n(eds. Cooper and van Leeuwen, 2013), which made available almost all\naspects of Turing's scientific oeuvre, with a wealth of modern\ncommentary. In this new climate, fresh attention has been paid to\nTuring's lesser-known work, and new light shed upon his\nachievements. He has emerged from obscurity to become one of the most\nintensely studied figures in modern science.\n",
