This is an\nimportant aspect of Plutarch's philosophy. Plutarch distinguishes\nsharply between God or the divine (theos, to theion) and\ngods, and the question is how the plurality of gods is to be\nunderstood vis-\u00e0-vis the first God. This is not entirely clear\n(Ziegler 1951, 940). Plutarch appears to maintain that the first God\ncan take different names, yet he is to be distinguished from the\ndeities of the Greek pantheon (such as Asclepius in Amatorius\n758A-B), who are to be identified with the lesser gods. In the On\nthe E at Delphi Apollo is presented as the supreme God\n(393D-394A), while elsewhere it is Zeus who is described as the\nsupreme God, creator of the universe (De facie 927B).\nAccording to Plutarch the first God constitutes a unity of utter\nsimplicity, a unity including all divine beings in it (De\nIside 377F), and is identified with the Good and with Being\n(De E 393B\u2013D; see Opsomer 2009,\n158\u2013160). Apparently Plutarch identifies the highest principle\nwith the Form of the Good of the Republic and with the\ndemiurge of the Timaeus (see Ferrari 2005, Brenk 2005), a\ntendency that Numenius and Plotinus will resist later. God rules over\nthe world and provides for it, but being supreme\n(an\u00f4tat\u00f4; Plat. Quest. 1000E),\nfather of gods and men alike, he remains transcendent. This becomes\nclear in Ammonius' speech in On the E in Delphi, where God is\nsaid to be \u201cbeyond everything\u201d (epekeina tou\npantos; 393B), but also in the On the Obsolescence of\nOracles, where Lamprias defends the possibility of God being\nprovident over many worlds, provided that these are of a finite number\n(426E). This means that God is not immanent in the world, and yet he\nis its creator. God's transcendence is maintained by delegating to the\nworld soul some mediatory demiurgic performance (see above, sect. 4.1;\ncf. Opsomer 2005, 94\u20135). This resonates with Plutarch's more\ngeneral view (inspired by Plato), according to which the soul has a\nmediating role between the intellect and the body or sensible reality\n(see below, sect. 5).\n\nApart from the world soul, the creator God also needs some further\nmediation with the sensible world if his transcendence is to be\nmaintained\u2014this is already suggested in the distinction between\nthe demiurge and the lesser gods in the Timaeus\n(42e). Plutarch acknowledges the existence of divine entities inferior\nto the first God or the One but also to gods, namely the\n\u201cdaimones.\u201d They are said to be \u201cby nature\non the boundary between gods and humans\u201d (De\ndef. or. 416C). Placed in the moon, these lesser gods mediate\nbetween the first God and human beings, thus extending God's\nprovidence to them (Dillon 1977, 216\u20138). Plutarch explores a\ntradition going back to Empedocles, to Plato (Symposium\n202d\u2013203e, Phaedo 107D, 113D, Republic 427b,\n620d, Timaeus 90a-d), and to Xenocrates, by whom he appears\nto be particularly influenced on this matter (De Iside 360E,\nDe def. or. 416C\u2013D). The precise role of the demons\nbecomes an interesting issue in view of the fact that Plutarch speaks\nof two kinds of demons, good and bad, and indeed he claims that demons\nexhibit different degrees of virtue and vice, as is the case with men\ntoo (De def. or. 417B, De Iside 360E). Plutarch\nprovides us with evidence according to which the role of demons\nconsists in communicating God's will to humans, bestowing them with\nprophetic powers and inspiration (Amatorius 758E, De\ngenio Socratis 580C, De facie 944C\u2013D), in taking\ncare of humans when they are needy (Amatorius 758A\u2013B),\nin taking care of the sanctuaries and the sacred rites (De\ndef. or. 417A\u2013B), but also in punishing humans and avenging\nhuman bad acts (ibid.). The latter is the role of the bad demons. For\napparently Plutarch maintained that proper punishment is never\nvengeful. This emerges when Plutarch discusses the question of divine\npunishment in his work On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance\n(De sera numinis vindicta).\n\nIn this work Plutarch examines an issue with which philosophers of his\nage are seriously concerned, namely that of theodicy. Even if God is\nnot responsible for occurrences of evil (see above, sect. 4.2), there\nis a question of why these are not always punished promptly by God. In\nhis treatise On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance Plutarch\naddresses the question of whether the delays of divine punishment speak\nagainst the existence of divine providence (550C) and he replies that\nthis is not the case. God, he argues, acts on reason, not on\npassionate anger or impulse (551A, 557E), thus avoiding errors, and by\ndoing so, Plutarch continues, he sets the model for our own actions\n(ibid.). On the other hand, Plutarch argues that human wickedness is\nnot always to be punished, because it of itself ruins the life of\nthose who act thus, and this is already a sufficient punishment\n(ibid. 556D-E). Besides, Plutarch suggests, the punishment of the\ndivine does not have to be obvious; this can actually take place in\nthe afterlife of the soul, as is suggested in Republic 10, so\nPlutarch claims that \u201cit is one and the same argument\n\u2026that establishes both the providence of god and the survival\nof the human soul\u201d (560F; see also below, sect. 5).\n",
