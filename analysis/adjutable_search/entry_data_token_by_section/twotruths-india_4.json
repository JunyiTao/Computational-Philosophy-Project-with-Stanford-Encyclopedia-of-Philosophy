    "main_text": "Sautr\u0101ntika || Ultimate truth\n2.1 Ultimate truth\n\nOf the two types of objects, some are ultimately real while others are\nonly conventionally real, and some are not even conventionally real,\nthey are just unreal, or fictions. In defining ultimate truth in the\nSautr\u0101ntika tradition, we read in Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s Verses on\nEpistemology: \u201cThat which is ultimately causally efficient is\nhere an ultimately existent (param\u0101rthasat). Conventionally\nexistent (sa\u1e41v\u1e5btisat) is otherwise. They are declared as\nthe definitions of the unique particular (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a) and\nthe universal (s\u0101m\u0101\u1e45yalak\u1e63a\u1e47a)\u201d\n(Dharmak\u012brti [PVK] Tshad ma ce 118b).\n\nUltimate truth is, on this definition, a phenomenon (dharma) that is\nultimately existent, and ultimately existent are ultimately causally\nefficient. Phenomenon that is ultimately causally efficient is\nintrinsically or objectively real, existing in and of itself as a\n\u201cunique particular\u201d\n (svalak\u1e63a\u1e47a).[5]\n By \u201cunique particular\u201d Dharmak\u012brti means ultimately\nreal phenomenon\u2014dharma that is self-defined, uniquely\nindividual, objectively real, existing independent of any conceptual\nfabrication, ultimately causally efficient (artha), a dharma which\nserves as an objects of direct perception, dharma that presents itself\nto the cognitions as distinctive/unique individuals.\n\nIn the Commentary on the Verses of Epistemology, Dharmak\u012brti\ncharacterises (Tshad ma ce 274b\u2013279b) all ultimately\nreal unique particulars exist as distinct individuals with their own\nintrinsic natures. And they satisfy three criteria:\n\nThey have determinate spatial locations (de\u015baniyata / yul\nnges pa) of their own, as real things do not have a shared property\namongst themselves. The real fire we see is either near or far, or at\nthe left or the right, or at the back or in the front. By contrast,\nthe universal\n fireness[6],\n that is, the concept of being a fire, does not occupy a determinate\nposition.\nUnique particulars are temporally determinate (k\u0101laniyata /\ndus nges pa or dus ma \u2018dres pa). They are only momentary\ninstants. They spontaneously go out of existence the moment they have\ncome into existence. This is not the case with the universals. Being\npurely conceptually constructed, they remain uninfluenced by the\ndynamism of causal conditions and hence are not affected by time.\nUnique particulars are ontologically determinate\n(\u0101k\u0101raniyata / ngo bo nges pa / ngo bo ma \u2018dres pa) as\nthey are causally conditioned; the effects of the aggregation of the\ncausal conditions that have the ability to produce them. When those\ncausal conditions come together at certain points in time, unique\nparticulars come into existence. When those conditions disintegrate\nand are not replaced by new conditions, unique particulars go out of\nexistence. When the conditions have not yet come together, unique\nparticulars are yet to obtain their ontological status.\n\n\nSo \u201cdeterminate intrinsic natures of the unique\nparticulars,\u201d Dharmak\u012brti argues in Commentary on the\nVerses of Epistemology, \u201care not accidental or fortuitous since\nwhat is not determinate cannot be spatially, temporally and\nontologically determinate\u201d (Tshad ma ce 179a).\n\nThe unique particulars are, Sautr\u0101ntika claims, ultimately real,\nand they supply us four arguments to support the claim:\n\n(1) Unique particulars are causally efficient phenomena\n(arthakriy\u0101samartha) ([PVT] Tshad ma ce 179a) because:\n(a) they have ability to serve pragmatic purpose of life\u2014fulfil\nthe objectives in our life, and (b) ability to produce a variety of\ncognitive images due to their remoteness or proximity. (Dharmottara\u2019s\nNy\u0101bindu\u1e6d\u012bk\u0101 Tshad ma we 36b\u201392a)\nBoth of these abilities must be associated exclusively with objects of\ndirect perception (Tshad ma we 45a).\n\n(2) Unique particulars present themselves only to a direct perceptual\ncognition as distinct and uniquely defined individuals because unique\nparticulars are, as Dharmak\u012brti\u2019s Ny\u0101yabindu points\nout \u201cthe objects whose nearness or remoteness presents the\ndifference of cognitive image\u201d (Tshad ma ce 231a) and\nthat object alone which produces the impression of vividness according\nto its remoteness or proximity, exists ultimately\n(DharmottaraTshad ma we 44b\u201345a).\n\n(3) Unique particulars are not denotable by language since they are\nbeyond the full grasp of any conceptual mind\n(\u015babdasy\u0101vi\u015baya). Although unique particulars are\nobjective references of language and thought, and we may have firm\nbeliefs about them, conceptual mind does not fully grasp their real\nnature. They are ultimately real, directly cognisable by means of\ncertain perceptions without reliance on other factors (nimitta) such\nas language and thought. Therefore they must exist. They are the sorts\nof phenomena whose cognition would not occur if they are not\nobjectively real.\n\nIn the Sautr\u0101ntika ontology ultimately real/existent (synonymous)\nunique particulars are classified into three kinds:\n\nmomentary instants of matter (r\u016bpa),\nmomentary instants of consciousness (vij\u00f1\u0101na) and\nmomentary instants of the non-associated composite phenomena,\nwhich are neither matter nor minds or mental factors\n(citta-caitta-viprayukta-sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra).\n\n\nThe Sautr\u0101ntika\u2019s theory of ultimate truth mirrors its ontology\nof flux in which unique particulars are viewed as spatially\ninfinitesimal atoms constituting temporally momentary events\n(k\u1e63a\u1e47ika) or as successive flashes of consciousnesses,\ncognitive events, all devoid of any real continuity as substratum.\nUnique particulars are ultimately real, although they are not enduring\nsubstances (dravyas) inhering in it\u2019s qualities (gu\u1e47as) and\nactions (karmas) as the Naiy\u0101yika-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika claims.\nThey are rather bundles of events arising and disappearing instantly.\nEven continuity of things and motion are only successive events\nclosely resembling each other. On this theory ultimate realities are\nmomentary point instants, and Vasubandhu and Dharmak\u012brti both\nargue that no conditioned phenomenon, therefore, no ultimately real\nunique particulars, endure more than a single moment\u2014hence they\nare momentary instants (k\u1e63a\u1e47ika).\n\nFour closely interrelated arguments provide the defence of the\nSautr\u0101ntika\u2019s claim that ultimately real unique particulars are\nmomentary instants. Vasubandhu and Dharmak\u012brti both employ the\nfirst two arguments. The third argument is one Dharmak\u012brti\nspecialises in his works.\n\n(1) Ultimately real unique particulars are momentary instants because\ntheir perishing or destruction is spontaneous to their becoming. This\nfollows because (i) unique particulars are inherently self-destructive\n(Vasubandhu [AKB], Mngon pa khu 166b\u2013167a), and (ii)\ntheir perishing or cessation is intrinsic and does not depend\non any other extrinsic causal factors (Dharmak\u012brti,\n[PVK] Tshad ma ce 102a; [PVT], Tshad ma ce\n178ab).\n\n(2) The ultimately real unique particulars are momentary instants\nbecause they are motionless, and do not move from one temporal or\nspatial location to another. They perish just where they were born\nsince nothing exists later than its acquisition of existence\n(Vasubandhu [AKB] Mngon pa khu 166b).\n\n(3) The third argument proves momentary instants of unique particulars\nfrom the inference of existence (sattv\u0101num\u0101na). This is a\ncase of the argument from identity of existence and production\n(svabh\u0101vahetu). All unique particulars which are ultimately\nexistent, are necessarily produced, since only those that are\nultimately existent, insofar as Dharmak\u012briti is concerned, are\nable to a perform causal function\u2014i.e., to produce effects. And\ncausally efficient unique particulars imply constant change for the\nrenewal and the perishing of their antecedent identities, therefore,\nthey are momentary.\n\nFinally (4), unique particulars are ultimately real not only on the\nground that they constitute the final ontological status, but also\nbecause it forms the basis of the Sautr\u0101ntika soteriology. The\nattainment of nirv\u0101\u1e47a \u2014 the ultimate freedom from the\nafflictions of life\u2014for the Sautr\u0101ntika, according to\nDharmak\u012brti\u2019s V\u0101dany\u0101ya, has an immediate\nperception of the unique particulars as its necessary condition\n(Tshad ma che 108b\u2013109a).\n",
