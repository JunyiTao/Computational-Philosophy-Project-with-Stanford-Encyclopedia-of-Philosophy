    "main_text": "Socrates and Plato || The \u201cSecond-Best\u201d Regime of the Laws\n3.5 The \u201cSecond-Best\u201d Regime of the Laws\n\nThe Laws, a work reported to have been still on wax tablets,\nand so possibly left unfinished when Plato died (Diogenes Laertius\nIII. 37), treats the specificity of politics as a matter not of\ndistinct vocational expertise but of the requirements of a\n\u201csecond-best\u201d (739a) city, one in which private property\nis allowed, as opposed to an ideal or implicitly first-best regime in\nwhich private property would be prohibited to all (thus going beyond\neven the ideal regime of the Republic). In this section, as\nin most scholarly discussions, I will assume that the second-best city\nfor which laws are laid out in the later books is the projected Cretan\ncolony of Magnesia, of which the Cretan (Cleinias) among the\ndialogue\u2019s three interlocutors has announced himself to be one\nof the intended founders. (For an alternative argument, that the\nsecond-best city is not meant to be Magnesia, see Bartels 2017.) In\nthis second-best city, the legislation for which is sketched out in\nspeech by the three interlocutors of the dialogue, politics still aims\nat virtue, and at the virtue of all the citizens, but those citizens\nall play a part in holding civic offices; the ordinary activities of\npolitics are shared, in what is described as a mixture of monarchy and\ndemocracy. That description gives rise to an idea of the \u201cmixed\nregime\u201d or \u201cmixed constitution\u201d which later became\ninfluential in its own right, as we shall see below (section 6).\n\nAnother influential aspect of the Laws is its positive\nevaluation of the nature of law itself as a topic proper to political\nphilosophy. While the Laws shares with the Statesman\nthe notion of law in an isolated and singular sense as being brutish\nand stubborn compared to expert knowledge, it recommends a\n\u201cdouble\u201d notion of law, in which each such command is\nprefaced with a persuasive account of its rationale, addressed to the\ncitizens, who are expected to read and understand it (719b\u2013723d,\nand passim). Some scholars have found that to be a\ndistinctively democratic and liberal account of law (Bobonich 2002;\nsee also the entry on\n Plato on utopia).\n That arguably goes too far in a proceduralist direction, given that\nthe value of law remains its embodiment of reason or understanding\n(nous), so that while adding persuasive preludes is a better\nway to exercise the coercive force of law, no agreement on the basis\nof persuasion could justify laws which departed from the standard of\nnous (Laks 2005). Nevertheless, the emphasis on law as an\nembodiment of reason, and as articulating the political ideals of the\ncity in a form that its citizens are to study and internalize\n(Nightingale 1993b, 1999), is distinctive to this dialogue.\n\nAlso notable is that the Laws\u2019 emphasis on all citizens\nas eligible, and so presumptively capable, to hold offices, differs\nsignificantly from the rule reserved for philosophers in the\n Republic.[9]\n The outlook in the Laws may have somewhat more affinity with\nthe closing passages of the Statesman, which refer to the\noffices or quasi-offices of rhetor, general and judge which at least\ncertain citizens will hold, those with the relevant expertise to play\neach role. The Statesman however reserves a special\nextraordinary role (presented as falling outside the structure of\nordinary civic offices) for the statesman whenever he is present in\nthe city (Lane 2013b). The role of the Statesman\u2019s\neponymous figure must therefore be distinguished from that of the\n\u201cNocturnal Council\u201d in the Laws (which is\nactually to meet just before dawn), a body of citizens who are\nselected for wisdom and judiciousness and whose role is to review the\nlaws and suggest potential changes to a body empowered to change them,\nrather than (as in the Statesman, at least theoretically) to\noverride them when it is better to do so (Reid 2021).\n\nMuch literature on Plato\u2019s political philosophy has debated\nwhether the turn in the Laws to the \u201csecond-best\u201d\nreflects a new form of realism on Plato\u2019s part about politics\nmore generally, invoking other remarks by the Visitor from Athens, one\nof the three interlocutors, along with Cleinias and the Spartan\nMegillus, which suggest that no one could ever be uniformly and\nreliably virtuous and immune to corruption, though this is not\nunequivocally stated (e.g. 874e\u2013875d). Has Plato in the\nLaws given up on his earlier idealism which rested on the\npossibility of the philosopher-king, or on the idea of the perfectly\nknowledgeable statesman? If so, should that be interpreted as\ndisillusionment or pessimism on his part, or as a more democratic or\nliberal turn? Or are there more fundamental continuities that connect\nand underlie even these seeming shifts? These questions structure the\nbroad debate about the meaning and trajectory of Platonic political\nphilosophy (for an overview, compare Klosko 2006 to Schofield\n2006).\n",
