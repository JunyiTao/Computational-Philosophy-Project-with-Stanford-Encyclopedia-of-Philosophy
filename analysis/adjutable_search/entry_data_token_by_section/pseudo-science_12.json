    "main_text": "Alternative demarcation criteria || Criteria based on scientific progress\n4.4 Criteria based on scientific progress\n\nPopper\u2019s demarcation criterion concerns the logical structure of\ntheories. Imre Lakatos described this criterion as \u201ca rather\nstunning one. A theory may be scientific even if there is not a shred\nof evidence in its favour, and it may be pseudoscientific even if all\nthe available evidence is in its favour. That is, the scientific or\nnon-scientific character of a theory can be determined independently\nof the facts\u201d (Lakatos 1981, 117).\n\nInstead, Lakatos (1970; 1974a; 1974b; 1981) proposed a modification of\nPopper\u2019s criterion that he called \u201csophisticated\n(methodological) falsificationism\u201d. On this view, the\ndemarcation criterion should not be applied to an isolated hypothesis\nor theory, but rather to a whole research program that is characterized\nby a series of theories successively replacing each other. In his\nview, a research program is progressive if the new theories make\nsurprising predictions that are confirmed. In contrast, a degenerating\nresearch programme is characterized by theories being fabricated only\nin order to accommodate known facts. Progress in science is only\npossible if a research program satisfies the minimum requirement that\neach new theory that is developed in the program has a larger\nempirical content than its predecessor. If a research program does not\nsatisfy this requirement, then it is pseudoscientific.\n\nAccording to Paul Thagard (1978, 228), a theory or discipline is pseudoscientific\nif it satisfies two criteria. One of these is that the theory fails to\nprogress, and the other that \u201cthe community of practitioners\nmakes little attempt to develop the theory towards solutions of the\nproblems, shows no concern for attempts to evaluate the theory in\nrelation to others, and is selective in considering confirmations and\ndisconfirmations\u201d. A major difference\nbetween this approach and that of Lakatos is that Lakatos would\nclassify a nonprogressive discipline as pseudoscientific even if its\npractitioners work hard to improve it and turn it into a progressive\ndiscipline. (In later work, Thagard has abandoned this approach and instead promoted a form of multi-criterial demarcation (Thagard 1988, 157-173).) \n\nIn a somewhat similar vein, Daniel Rothbart (1990) emphasized the\ndistinction between the standards to be used when testing a theory and\nthose to be used when determining whether a theory should at all be\ntested. The latter, the eligibility criteria, include that the theory\nshould encapsulate the explanatory success of its rival, and that it\nshould yield testable implications that are inconsistent with those of\nthe rival. According to Rothbart, a theory is unscientific if it is\nnot testworthy in this sense.\n\nGeorge Reisch proposed that demarcation could be based on the\nrequirement that a scientific discipline be adequately integrated into\nthe other sciences. The various scientific disciplines have strong\ninterconnections that are based on methodology, theory, similarity of\nmodels etc. Creationism, for instance, is not scientific because its\nbasic principles and beliefs are incompatible with those that connect\nand unify the sciences. More generally speaking, says Reisch, an\nepistemic field is pseudoscientific if it cannot be incorporated into\nthe existing network of established sciences (Reisch 1998; cf. Bunge\n1982, 379).\n\nPaul Hoyninengen-Huene (2013) identifies science with systematic\nknowledge, and proposes that systematicity can be used as a\ndemarcation criterion. However as shown by Naomi Oreskes, this is a\nproblematic criterion, not least since some pseudosciences seem to\nsatisfy it (Oreskes 2019).\n\n",
