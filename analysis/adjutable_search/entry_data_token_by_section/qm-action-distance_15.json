    "main_text": "Superluminal signaling || The prospects of controllable probabilistic dependence\n7.4 The prospects of controllable probabilistic dependence\n\n\nIn section 7.3.1, we discussed the question of the in-principle\ncontrollability of local measurement processes and in particular the\nprobability of their outcome, and the implications of such\ncontrollability for the in-principle possibility of superluminal\nsignaling in the context of the CSL models. But this question is not\nspecific to the CSL model and (more generally) the dynamical models\nfor state-vector reduction. It seems likely to arise also in other\nquantum theories that model measurements realistically. Here is\nwhy. Real measurements take time. And during that time, some physical\nvariable, other than the state of the measured system and the setting\nof the measurement apparatus, might influence the chance (i.e., the\nsingle-case objective probability) of the measurement outcome. In\nparticular, during the L-measurement in the EPR/B experiment, the\nchance of the L-outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019\n(\u2018down\u2019) might depend on the value of some physical\nvariable in the L-wing, other than the state of the particle pair and\nthe setting of the L-measurement apparatus. If so, it will follow from\nthe familiar perfect anti-correlation of the singlet state that the\nchance of R-outcome z-spin \u2018up\u2019\n(\u2018down\u2019) will depend on the value of such variable (for\ndetails, see Kronz 1990a,b, Jones and Clifton 1993, pp. 304-305, and\nBerkovitz 1998a, section 4.3.4). Thus, if the value of such a variable\nwere controllable, controllable probabilistic dependence would\nobtain.\n",
