    "main_text": "The Tractatus Theologico-Politicus || Spinoza\u2019s Argument for Toleration\n3.5 Spinoza\u2019s Argument for Toleration\n\n\nSpinoza is often remembered for his contribution to the liberal\ntradition, due, in large part, to his defense of the freedoms of\nthought and speech in TTP 20. However, the tolerationism expressed in\nTTP 20 appears to stand in tension with the Erastian claim of TTP 19.\nHow can Spinoza be a liberal about religious practice while also\ndefending the view that the state maintains full right over matters of\nreligion (TTP, Ch. 19)? There are three things worth noting here. First, unlike Locke\u2019s tolerationism, Spinoza\u2019s defense of\ncivil liberties in TTP 20 is not fundamentally a defense freedom of\nworship (Israel 2001, 265\u2013266). Rather, it is essentially a defense of\nthe freedom to philosophize; freedom of worship is at best an\nincidental byproduct of this primary aim. Second, Spinoza\ndistinguishes between outward expressions of faith and one\u2019s\ninward worship of God. Sovereign authority over religious expression\nconcerns only the former, leaving the latter the domain of the\nindividual, for reasons that we will examine in a moment. Both of\nthese positions can be understood as lending support to the Arminian\ncause against Calvinist Theocrats (Nadler 1999, 12). Finally, it\nshould be mentioned that Spinoza\u2019s denial that freedoms concerning\noutward religious expression must be protected points to the limited\nnature of his brand of toleration. The sovereign retains full\ndiscretion to determine which actions are acceptable and what forms of\nspeech are seditious. As Lewis Feuer ruefully notes, Spinoza does not\noffer anything resembling Oliver Wendell Holmes\u2019s standard of\n\u201cclear and present danger\u201d to constrain sovereign\nintervention (1987, 114).\n\n\nWhat are Spinoza\u2019s arguments for his, albeit limited, defense\nfreedoms of thought and speech? The first argument is that it is\nstrictly impossible to control another\u2019s beliefs completely\n(20, 250\u201351). Since right is coextensive with power,\nlacking the power to control beliefs entails lacking the right to do\nso. However, since Spinoza admits that beliefs can be influenced in\nmyriad ways, even if not fully controlled, this argument amounts to a\nrather restricted defense of freedom of conscience.\n\n\nNext, the argument shifts from considering what the sovereign\ncan do to what it would be practical or\nprudent for a sovereign to do. Spinoza offers a battery of\npragmatic reasons in defense of non-interference. For instance, he\nargues that \u201ca state can never succeed very far in attempting to\nforce people to speak as the sovereign power commands\u201d (TTP 20,\n251). Men are naturally inclined to express what they believe (ibid.),\nand so just as attempts to regulate beliefs fail, so do attempts to\nregulate the expressions of these beliefs. Moreover, even if a state\nwere to regulate speech, this would only result in the erosion of good\nfaith [fides] on which civil associations depend, since men\nwould be \u201cthinking one thing and saying something else\u201d\n(TTP 20, 255). It is thus foolish to seek to regulate all speech, even if\nit is also \u201cvery dangerous\u201d to grant unlimited freedom of\nspeech (TTP 20, 252).\n\n\nSpinoza also argues that in general the more oppressively a sovereign\ngoverns, the more rebellious the citizens will be, since most people\nare \u201cso constituted that there is nothing they would more\nreluctantly put up with than that the opinions they belief to be true\nshould be outlawed\u201d (TTP 20, 255). The source of oppression and the\nresistance to it have a common root on Spinoza\u2019s account, namely,\nambition, or the desire for others to approve of the same things that\nwe do (see\nEIIIP29; cf. Rosenthal 2001 and 2003). Men being constituted\nas they are, when differences of opinion arise\u2014as they inevitably\ndo\u2014they are inclined to foist their standard on others and to\nresist others\u2019 attempts to do the same. So, however common\nattempts to regulate the beliefs, speech, and behavior of others may\nbe, it is politically unstable to do so. Moreover, Spinoza argues that\nit is often the least wise and the most obnoxious who initiate moral\ncrusades, and just as it is often the wisest and most peace-loving who\nare the targets of such campaigns (TTP 20, 256\u201358).\n\n\nIt is worth noting that these arguments in defense of civil liberties\nare thoroughly pragmatic; they rely on psychological principles and\nempirical observations to illustrate the instability and imprudence of\noppressive governance (see Steinberg 2010b). They are not principled\narguments that depend on rights or the intrinsic value of liberty,\nmuch to the frustration of some commentators (Feuer 1987; Curley\n1996).\n",
