    "main_text": "Background and Introduction\n1. Background and Introduction\n\nAs will become apparent, \u201cscientific explanation\u201d is a\ntopic that raises a number of interrelated issues. Some background\norientation will be useful before turning to the details of competing\nmodels. A presupposition of most recent discussion has been that\nscience sometimes provides explanations (rather than something that\nfalls short of explanation\u2014e.g., \u201cmere description\u201d)\nand that the task of a \u201ctheory\u201d or \u201cmodel\u201d of\nscientific explanation is to characterize the structure of such\nexplanations. It is thus assumed that there is (at some suitably\nabstract and general level of description) a single kind or form of\nexplanation that is \u201cscientific\u201d. In fact, the notion of\n\u201cscientific explanation\u201d suggests at least two\ncontrasts\u2014first, a contrast between those\n\u201cexplanations\u201d that are characteristic of\n\u201cscience\u201d and those explanations that are not, and,\nsecond, a contrast between \u201cexplanation\u201d and something\nelse. However, with respect to the first contrast, much of the recent\nphilosophical literature assumes that there is substantial continuity\nbetween explanations found in science and some forms of explanation\nfound in ordinary, non-scientific contexts. It is further assumed that\nit is the task of a theory of explanation to capture what is common to\nboth scientific and some ordinary, non-scientific forms of\nexplanation. These assumptions help to explain (what may otherwise\nstrike the reader as curious) why, as this entry will illustrate,\ndiscussions of scientific explanation often move back and forth\nbetween examples drawn from bona-fide science (e.g., explanations of\nthe trajectories of the planets that appeal to Newtonian mechanics)\nand more homey examples (e.g., the tipping over of inkwells).\n\nWith respect to the second contrast, most models of explanation assume\nthat it is possible for a set of claims to be true, accurate,\nsupported by evidence, and so on and yet unexplanatory. For example,\nall of the accounts of scientific explanation described below would\nagree that an account of the appearance of a particular species of\nbird of the sort found in a bird guidebook is, however accurate, not\nan explanation of anything of interest to biologists (such as the\ndevelopment, characteristic features, or behavior of that species).\nInstead, such an account is \u201cmerely descriptive\u201d. However,\ndifferent models of explanation provide different accounts of what the\ncontrast between the explanatory and merely descriptive consists\nin.\n\nA related point is that, while most theorists of scientific\nexplanation have proposed models that are intended to cover at least\nsome cases of explanation that we would not think of as part of\nscience, they have nonetheless assumed some implicit restriction on\nthe kinds of explanation they have sought to reconstruct. It has often\nbeen noted that the word \u201cexplanation\u201d is used in a wide\nvariety of ways in ordinary English\u2014we speak of explaining the\nmeaning of a word, explaining how to bake a pie, explaining why one\nmade a certain decision (where this is to offer a justification) and\nso on. Although the various models discussed below have sometimes been\ncriticized for their failure to capture all of these forms of\n\u201cexplanation\u201d (see, e.g., Scriven 1959), it is clear that\nthey were never intended to do this. Instead, their intended\nexplicandum is, very roughly, explanations of why\nthings happen, where the \u201cthings\u201d in question can be\neither particular events or something more general\u2014e.g.,\nregularities or repeatable patterns in nature. Paradigms of this sort\nof explanation include: the explanation for the advance in the\nperihelion of mercury provided by General Relativity, the explanation\nof the extinction of the dinosaurs in terms of the impact of a large\nasteroid at the end of the Cretaceous period, the explanation provided\nby the police for why a traffic accident occurred (the driver was\nspeeding and there was ice on the road), and the standard explanation\nprovided in economics textbooks for why monopolies will, in comparison\nwith firms in perfectly competitive markets, raise prices and reduce\noutput.\n\nFinally, a few words about the broader epistemological and\nmethodological background to the models described below. Many\nphilosophers think of concepts like \u201cexplanation\u201d,\n\u201claw\u201d, \u201ccause\u201d, and \u201csupport for\ncounterfactuals\u201d as part of an interrelated family of concepts\nthat are \u201cmodal\u201d in character. For familiar\n\u201cempiricist\u201d reasons, Hempel and many other early\ndefenders of the DN model regarded these concepts as not well\nunderstood, at least prior to analysis. It was assumed that it would\nbe \u201ccircular\u201d to explain one concept from this family in\nterms of others from the same family and that they must instead be\nexplicated in terms of other concepts from outside the modal\nfamily\u2014concepts that more obviously satisfied (what were taken\nto be) empiricist standards of intelligibility and testability. For\nexample, in Hempel\u2019s version of the DN model, the\nnotion of a \u201claw\u201d plays a key role in explicating the\nconcept of \u201cexplanation\u201d, and his assumption is that laws\nare just regularities that meet certain further conditions that are\nalso acceptable to empiricists. As we shall see, these empiricist\nstandards (and an accompanying unwillingness to employ modal concepts\nas primitives) have continued to play a central role in the models of\nexplanation developed subsequent to the DN model.\n\nA related issue has to do with whether all scientific explanations are\ncausal and if not, what distinguishes causal from non-causal\nexplanations. Hempel recognized both causal and non-causal forms of\nexplanation but held that both were captured by the DN model\n\u2013in his view, causal explanations are simply DN\nexplanations that cite causal laws (which he regarded as a proper\nsubset of all laws). Many but not all of the accounts discussed below\nin effect assume that many of the problems with the DN model can be\ntraced to its commitment to an inadequate account of causation; thus\nthat getting clearer about causal notions would lead to more\nadequate accounts of explanation. By contrast, a substantial amount of\nrecent discussion of explanation has moved away from this focus on\ncausation and instead explores the possibility of non-causal forms of\nexplanation.[1]\n\n\nSuggested Readings: Salmon (1989) is a superb\ncritical survey of all the models of scientific explanation discussed\nin this entry. Kitcher and Salmon (1989), Pitt (1988), and Ruben\n(1993) are anthologies that contain a number of influential\narticles.\n",
