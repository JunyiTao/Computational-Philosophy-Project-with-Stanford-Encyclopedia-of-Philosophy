    "main_text": "Beyond Coherence || Foundations\n5.4 Competing Narratives\n\nIn some scholarly circles it is taken as obvious that New Testament\nteaching is\u00a0not trinitarian\u2013that it neither asserts, nor\nimplies, nor assumes anything about a tripersonal God (see e.g. Baber\n2019, 148\u201356; K\u00fcng 1995, 95\u20136; see also\n supplement on the history of Trinity doctrines, section 2).\n But most analytic literature on the Trinity assumes the truth of an\northodox narrative about where Trinity theories come from. According\nto this, from the beginning Christians were implicitly trinitarian;\nthat is, they held views which imply that God is a Trinity, but\ntypically did not realize this or have adequate language to express\nit. By at least the late 300s, they had gained enough new language\nand/or concepts to express what they had been committed to all\nalong.\n\nBut in recent analytic literature on the Trinity there are two\ncounternarratives, both of which see the idea of a triune God as\nentering into Christian traditions in the last half of the 300s. Beau\nBranson argues that \u201cMonarchical Trinitarianism\u201d, which in\nhis view correctly understands the theology of the authoritative\nfourth century Greek \u201cfathers\u201d (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory\nof Nyssa, and Gregory of Nazianzus) is a trinitarian theology on which\n\u201cStrictly speaking, The One God just is the Father\u201d\n(Branson forthcoming, Section 6). He contrasts this with most other\nTrinity theories, which he calls \u201cegalitarian\u201d or\n\u201csymmetrical\u201d, theories on which \u201call three persons\nhave an \u2018equal claim\u2019 to being called \u2018God,\u2019\nin any and every sense.\u201d (ibid.) Branson criticizes\nTuggy\u2019s (2016a) analyses of the concepts trinitarian and\nunitarian, and offers rival definitions on which \u201cMonarchical\nTrinitarianism\u201d is trinitarian and not unitarian. To be\ntrinitarian, a theology needs only to assert that \u201cthere are\nexactly three divine \u2018persons\u2019 (or individuals, etc.).\nNevertheless\u2026there is exactly one God\u201d (Section 5). As\nBranson understands the history of Christian theology, the idea that\n\u201cthe Trinity\u201d is a tripersonal God is a misunderstanding\nof tradition which is due particularly to \u201cWestern\u201d\nthinkers, such as Augustine. Branson cites some recent Orthodox\ntheologians who hold, like John Behr, that \u201cthere is not One God\nthe Trinity, but One God Father Almighty\u201d (Behr 2018, 330). In\nreply, Tuggy has argued that recent Orthodox theologians\nseem\u00a0divided on this point, and that the idea of a triune God\n(the one God as the Trinity) is found even in some of the Greek\nwriters Branson claims as exemplars of theological orthodoxy (Tuggy\n2020).\n\nAnother recent counternarrative sees ancient mainstream Christian\ntheology as changing from unitarian to trinitarian. Tuggy (2019)\nargues that in the New Testament the one God is not the Trinity but\nrather the Father alone. The argument moves from facts about the texts\nof the New Testament to what the authors probably thought about the\none God, using what philosophers of science call the likelihood\nprinciple or the prime principle of confirmation. Tuggy sees such\nidentification of the one God with the Father dominating early\nChristian theologies until around the time of the second ecumenical\ncouncil in 381 C.E. (Tuggy 2017, Chapter 5). Then, the Son and the\nSpirit, which in many 2nd to early 4th c. speculations were two lesser\ndeities in addition to God, were taught to, together with the Father,\nsomehow comprise the one God, the Trinity.
