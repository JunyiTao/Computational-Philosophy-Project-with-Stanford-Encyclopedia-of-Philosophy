    "main_text": "The Development of Science\n2. The Development of Science\n In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn paints a\npicture of the development of science quite unlike any that had gone\nbefore. Indeed, before Kuhn, there was little by way of a carefully\nconsidered, theoretically explained account of scientific\nchange. Instead, there was a conception of how science ought to\ndevelop that was a by-product of the prevailing philosophy of science,\nas well as a popular, heroic view of scientific progress. According to\nsuch opinions, science develops by the addition of new truths to the\nstock of old truths, or the increasing approximation of theories to\nthe truth, and in the odd case, the correction of past errors. Such\nprogress might accelerate in the hands of a particularly great\nscientist, but progress itself is guaranteed by the scientific\nmethod.\nIn the 1950s, when Kuhn began his historical studies of science,\nthe history of science was a young academic discipline. Even so, it\nwas becoming clear that scientific change was not always as\nstraightforward as the standard, traditional view would have it. Kuhn\nwas the first and most important author to articulate a developed\nalternative account. Since the standard view dovetailed with the\ndominant, positivist-influenced philosophy of science, a non-standard\nview would have important consequences for the philosophy of\nscience. Kuhn had little formal philosophical training but was\nnonetheless fully conscious of the significance of his innovation for\nphilosophy, and indeed he called his work \u2018history for philosophical\npurposes\u2019 (Kuhn 2000, 276).\n According to Kuhn the development of a science is not uniform but\nhas alternating \u2018normal\u2019 and \u2018revolutionary\u2019\n(or \u2018extraordinary\u2019) phases. The revolutionary phases are\nnot merely periods of accelerated progress, but differ qualitatively\nfrom normal science. Normal science does resemble the standard\ncumulative picture of scientific progress, on the surface at\nleast. Kuhn describes normal science as \u2018puzzle-solving\u2019\n(1962/1970a, 35\u201342). While this term suggests that normal\nscience is not dramatic, its main purpose is to convey the idea that\nlike someone doing a crossword puzzle or a chess problem or a jigsaw,\nthe puzzle-solver expects to have a reasonable chance of solving the\npuzzle, that his doing so will depend mainly on his own ability, and\nthat the puzzle itself and its methods of solution will have a high\ndegree of familiarity. A puzzle-solver is not entering completely\nuncharted territory. Because its puzzles and their solutions are\nfamiliar and relatively straightforward, normal science can expect to\naccumulate a growing stock of puzzle-solutions. Revolutionary science,\nhowever, is not cumulative in that, according to Kuhn, scientific\nrevolutions involve a revision to existing scientific belief or\npractice (1962/1970a, 92). Not all the achievements of the preceding\nperiod of normal science are preserved in a revolution, and indeed a\nlater period of science may find itself without an explanation for a\nphenomenon that in an earlier period was held to be successfully\nexplained. This feature of scientific revolutions has become known as\n\u2018Kuhn-loss\u2019 (1962/1970a, 99\u2013100).\n If, as in the standard picture, scientific revolutions are like\nnormal science but better, then revolutionary science will at all\ntimes be regarded as something positive, to be sought, promoted, and\nwelcomed. Revolutions are to be sought on Popper\u2019s view also, but not\nbecause they add to positive knowledge of the truth of theories but\nbecause they add to the negative knowledge that the relevant theories\nare false. Kuhn rejected both the traditional and Popperian views in\nthis regard. He claims that normal science can succeed in making\nprogress only if there is a strong commitment by the relevant\nscientific community to their shared theoretical beliefs, values,\ninstruments and techniques, and even metaphysics. This constellation\nof shared commitments Kuhn at one point calls a \u2018disciplinary\nmatrix\u2019 (1970a, 182) although elsewhere he often uses the term\n\u2018paradigm\u2019. Because commitment to the disciplinary matrix\nis a pre-requisite for successful normal science, an inculcation of\nthat commitment is a key element in scientific training and in the\nformation of the mind-set of a successful scientist. This tension\nbetween the desire for innovation and the necessary conservativeness\nof most scientists was the subject of one of Kuhn\u2019s first essays in\nthe theory of science, \u201cThe Essential Tension\u201d (1959). The\nunusual emphasis on a conservative attitude distinguishes Kuhn not\nonly from the heroic element of the standard picture but also from\nPopper and his depiction of the scientist forever attempting to refute\nher most important theories.\n This conservative resistance to the attempted refutation of key\ntheories means that revolutions are not sought except under\nextreme circumstances. Popper\u2019s philosophy requires that a single\nreproducible, anomalous phenomenon be enough to result in the\nrejection of a theory (Popper 1959, 86\u20137). Kuhn\u2019s view is that during\nnormal science scientists neither test nor seek to confirm the guiding\ntheories of their disciplinary matrix. Nor do they regard anomalous\nresults as falsifying those theories. (It is only speculative\npuzzle-solutions that can be falsified in a Popperian fashion during\nnormal science (1970b, 19).) Rather, anomalies are ignored or explained\naway if at all possible. It is only the accumulation of particularly\ntroublesome anomalies that poses a serious problem for the existing\ndisciplinary matrix. A particularly troublesome anomaly is one that\nundermines the practice of normal science. For example, an anomaly\nmight reveal inadequacies in some commonly used piece of equipment,\nperhaps by casting doubt on the underlying theory. If much of normal\nscience relies upon this piece of equipment, normal science will find\nit difficult to continue with confidence until this anomaly is\naddressed. A widespread failure in such confidence Kuhn calls a\n\u2018crisis\u2019 (1962/1970a, 66\u201376).\n The most interesting response to crisis will be the search for a\nrevised disciplinary matrix, a revision that will allow for the\nelimination of at least the most pressing anomalies and optimally the\nsolution of many outstanding, unsolved puzzles. Such a revision\nwill be a scientific revolution. According to Popper the revolutionary\noverthrow of a theory is one that is logically required by an\nanomaly. According to Kuhn however, there are no rules for deciding\nthe significance of a puzzle and for weighing puzzles and their\nsolutions against one another. The decision to opt for a revision of a\ndisciplinary matrix is not one that is rationally compelled; nor is\nthe particular choice of revision rationally compelled. For this\nreason the revolutionary phase is particularly open to competition\namong differing ideas and rational disagreement about their relative\nmerits. Kuhn does briefly mention that extra-scientific factors might\nhelp decide the outcome of a scientific revolution\u2014the\nnationalities and personalities of leading protagonists, for example\n(1962/1970a, 152\u20133). This suggestion grew in the hands of some\nsociologists and historians of science into the thesis that the\noutcome of a scientific revolution, indeed of any step in the\ndevelopment of science, is always determined by socio-political\nfactors. Kuhn himself repudiated such ideas and his work makes it\nclear that the factors determining the outcome of a scientific\ndispute, particularly in modern science, are almost always to be found\nwithin science, specifically in connexion with the puzzle-solving\npower of the competing ideas.\n Kuhn states that science does progress, even through revolutions\n(1962/1970a, 160ff). The phenomenon of Kuhn-loss does, in Kuhn\u2019s\nview, rule out the traditional cumulative picture of progress. The\nrevolutionary search for a replacement paradigm is driven by the\nfailure of the existing paradigm to solve certain important\nanomalies. Any replacement paradigm had better solve the majority of\nthose puzzles, or it will not be worth adopting in place of the\nexisting paradigm. At the same time, even if there is some Kuhn-loss,\na worthy replacement must also retain much of the problem-solving\npower of its predecessor (1962/1970a, 169). (Kuhn does clarify the\npoint by asserting that the newer theory must retain pretty well all\nits predecessor\u2019s power to solve quantitative problems. It may however\nlose some qualitative, explanatory power [1970b, 20].) Hence we can\nsay that revolutions do bring with them an overall increase in\npuzzle-solving power, the number and significance of the puzzles and\nanomalies solved by the revised paradigm exceeding the number and\nsignificance of the puzzles-solutions that are no longer available as\na result of Kuhn-loss. Kuhn is quick to deny that there is any\ninference from such increases to improved nearness to the truth\n((1962/1970a, 170\u20131). Indeed he later denies that any sense can\nbe made of the notion of nearness to the truth (1970a, 206).\n\nRejecting a teleological view of science progressing towards the\ntruth, Kuhn favours an evolutionary view of scientific progress\n(1962/1970a, 170\u20133), discussed in detail by Wray (2011) (see\nalso Bird 2000 and Renzi 2009). The evolutionary development of an\norganism might be seen as its response to a challenge set by its\nenvironment. But that does not imply that there is some ideal form of\nthe organism that it is evolving towards. Analogously, science\nimproves by allowing its theories to evolve in response to puzzles and\nprogress is measured by its success in solving those puzzles; it is\nnot measured by its progress towards to an ideal true theory.  While\nevolution does not lead towards ideal organisms, it does lead to\ngreater diversity of kinds of organism.  As Wray explains, this is the\nbasis of a Kuhnian account of specialization in science, an account\nthat Kuhn was developing particularly in the latter part of his\ncareer.  According to this account, the revolutionary new theory that\nsucceeds in replacing another that is subject to crisis, may fail to\nsatisfy all the needs of those working with the earlier theory.  One\nresponse to this might be for the field to develop two theories, with\ndomains restricted relative to the original theory (one might be the\nold theory or a version of it).  This formation of new specialties\nwill also bring with it new taxonomic structures and so leads to\nincommensurability.\n",
