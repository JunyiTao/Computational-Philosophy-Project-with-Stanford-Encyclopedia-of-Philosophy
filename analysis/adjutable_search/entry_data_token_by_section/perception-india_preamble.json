    "main_text": "\n\nClassical Indian Philosophy accepts perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a), or perceptual experience, as the primary\nmeans of knowledge (pram\u0101\u1e47a). Perception\n(pratyak\u1e63a) is etymologically rooted in the\nsense-faculty or the sense-organ (ak\u1e63a) and can be\ntranslated as sensory awareness, while pram\u0101\u1e47a, on\nthe other hand, is derived from knowledge (pram\u0101) and,\nliterally means \u2018the instrument in the act of knowing\u2019.\nHowever, the standard interpretation of perception accepted by\nclassical Indian philosophers, barring the Buddhists and the\nVed\u0101ntins, is that it is a cognition arising within the\nself\u2014the knowing subject\u2014from mental operations following\na sense-object contact. It, therefore, is neither an instrument in the\nact of knowing, nor a mere sensory awareness. Definitions of\nperception from various classical Indian philosophy schools are given\nin section 2 below.\n\nThe same is true of concepts. There is no one agreed notion or\ndefinition of concept understood as the meaning of a general term in\nClassical Indian Philosophy. Rather, we have a variety of views\nranging from robust realism about concepts as real properties,\nessences or universals to extreme nominalism which admits only of\nunique particulars with versions of conceptualism in between. The\nrobust realist position is defended by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nschools, the nominalist by the Buddhist schools and the conceptualist\nby the Ved\u0101ntins and Jainas. I will not be discussing the\nconceptualist position or their arguments here because ultimately this\nposition ends up collapsing into a version of realism or\nnominalism.\n",
