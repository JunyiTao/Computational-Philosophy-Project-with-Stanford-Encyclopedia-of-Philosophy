    "main_text": "The Soul of Plants\n4. The Soul of Plants\n\nFechner has gone down in history as \u201cthe father of\npanpsychism\u201d. But that phrase is problematic. We should drop the\nclaim to paternity since the doctrine is very old and has had a wealth\nof followers, both in ancient and modern times. The more important\nquestion is whether it is accurate to describe Fechner\u2019s\nphilosophy as \u201cpanpsychism\u201d. The label is correct if it\nmeans the following: the doctrine that all living beings are psychic,\ni.e., have the power of\n consciousness.[7]\n\n\nWe should distinguish panpsychism from organicism. The panpsychist\nholds that all living beings are psychic where the psyche involves the\npower of consciousness; the organicists holds that living beings are\nnot necessarily psychic, that their living powers might not be\nconscious but only be subconscious drives. Organicism is ambiguous: it\ncan mean \n\n the doctrine that everything in the universe is alive; or \n the doctrine that the universe is organic in structure, i.e.,\nforms a whole where the whole precedes the parts and makes them\npossible.\n\n\nIt is possible to hold (a) and (b); but it is also possible to hold\n(b) and not (a) if one thinks that there are inorganic parts within\nthe organic whole. Organicists are not necessarily panpsychists\nbecause they might hold that there are living creatures who are not\nconscious; panpsychists are organicists at least in sense (b) but not\nnecessarily in sense (a). Fechner was an organicist in sense (b) but\nnot (a) because he held that there is such a thing as inorganic nature\n(Fechner 1879: 37). \n\nFechner\u2019s first exposition of panpsychism is his Nanna oder\n\u00fcber das Seelenleben der Pflanzen, which he first published\nin 1848. Nanna took the first step toward panpsychism by\narguing that plants are conscious beings, having a life of feeling and\nvolition. In his Zend-Avesta, which first appeared in 1851,\nFechner took his panpsychism a giant step further by contending that\nplanets, and indeed the cosmos as a whole, are also psychic or mental.\nFechner defended and elaborated his panpsychism in two works of the\nearly 1860s: Ueber die Seelenfrage (1861) and Die Drei\nMotive and Gr\u00fcnde des Glaubens (1863). His final exposition\nof his doctrine appears in his Die Tagesansicht gegen\u00fcber der\nNachtansicht (1879).\n\nFechner\u2019s panpsychism originated from a mystical experience\nwhich came at the end of his mental\n breakdown.[8]\n The day he began to see again, 5 October 1843, he walked into the\ngarden of his house to look at the plants and flowers. Now the whole\nworld appeared alive to him; it seemed for the first time to reveal\nitself to him. The flowers were all illuminated, as if from within.\nThe light they shed seemed to come from their very souls. \n\n\nThe whole garden seemed to me transformed, as if not I but all of\nnature were arisen anew; and I thought, it is only a matter of opening\nmy eyes again to allow a nature grown old to become young again.\n(Nanna: 65) \n\n\nFrom that day onward, Fechner made it his mission to be true to that\nexperience, to capture its meaning in philosophical prose. The\nultimate results of his efforts were Nanna and\nZend-Avesta. \n\nThough Fechner\u2019s panpsychism arose from a mystical experience,\nit is not based upon it; that experience was the origin of his view,\nnot the rationale for it. Fechner insisted in both Nanna and\nZend-Avesta that his doctrine was based upon the best natural\nscience. While he did not claim certainty or finality for his\ndoctrine, he still maintained that it was the most \u201clikely\nstory\u201d given the latest findings of empirical research. \n\nFechner explains the title of his work in his forward (Nanna:\nxi). He wanted a short and catchy name for his book. He first\nconsidered \u201cFlora\u201d and \u201cHamadryas\u201d; but then\nhe found the first too botanical and the second too archaic. Just the\nright name came from Uhland\u2019s work on Nordic mythology (1836:\n147\u2013148). Nanna was the goddess of flowers, the wife of Baldur,\nthe god of light. \n\nFechner writes that it is the purpose of his work to show how plants\nare part of a world ensouled by God (Nanna: xiii). It then\nseems as if panpsychism can be proven simply from the omnipresence of\nGod. But Fechner explicitly rejects this strategy because it would\nmake the question of the soul of plants depend on general metaphysical\nquestions, such as the relationships between God and nature or mind\nand body (Nanna: 7). Furthermore, even if we could prove the\nomnipresence of the divine mind, Fechner adds, it still would not\nprove that each individual thing is conscious. It would still be\npossible for the divine mind to be omnipresent in nature even though\nno individual thing is conscious (Nanna: 3). For these\nreasons, Fechner will investigate the question of the soul of plants\non its own, apart from any general metaphysics; he asks: What evidence\ndo we have for the common view that only humans and animals but not\nplants have souls? \n\nAll belief in the existence of other minds, Fechner reminds us, is\nbased on analogy. We assume that other humans have minds because their\nspeech and actions are like our own; and we infer that animals have\nminds because, in crucial respects, their actions are like our own.\nBut we must be careful with analogy, Fechner warns, because we cannot\ndemand that other creatures be exactly like ourselves in all respects.\nThe very nature of analogy means that they are like us in some\nrespects but unlike us in others. We are permitted to infer, because\nanalogies do not exactly hold, that other creatures have minds\nsimilar to our own; but similarity does not mean identical or\nalike in all respects. Their minds could still be, in other respects,\nvery different from our own. Though we assume that worms have souls,\nwe recognize that they are very different ones from our own\n(Nanna: 6). Why cannot we then say that plants too have\nsouls, though very different ones from us?\n\nFechner makes it his business to argue that all the reasons for\nascribing souls to animals also hold for plants (Nanna: 7).\nPlants and animals have very similar structures and functions. They\nshare a similar pattern of development (birth, maturity, death); both\nhave similar cellular structures; both require nutrition, both engage\nin digestion, excretion, respiration. All that we can infer from the\ndifferences in their organic structure, function and development is\nthat plants have different souls than our own, not that they\nhave no souls at all (Nanna: 9).\n\nThe most common reason for denying souls to plants, Fechner notes, is\nthat they do not have a central nervous system. If one destroys the\nnerves of a human or animal, they show no signs of life. It therefore\nseems that plants cannot a have a soul because they have no nervous\nsystem. But here Fechner raises an interesting question: Are nerves\nthe only possible organs to produce sensation? Nature has many means\nto the same end, and we should not assume that there is only one way\nto produce sensation. If we cut all the strings of a violin, it\nproduces no sound; but not all instruments are stringed. We can\nproduce sound from wind instruments. Similarly, nature might have many\nmeans of creating sensations apart from a nervous system\n(Nanna: 28). The fibers of plants could perform the same\nfunction as nerves.\n\nAnother common reason for denying souls to plants is that they are not\ncapable of locomotion, of changing their position, as humans and\nanimals are (Nanna: 41, 71). But why should motion to\ndifferent places be necessary for life?, Fechner asks. Plants move\ntoo, its just that they move vertically rather than horizontally. One\nmaintains that the movements of plants are not voluntary, like that of\nhumans and animals, because they are subject to physical necessity.\nBut Fechner replies that the actions of animals too can be shown to be\nphysically necessary. The mere necessity of an action\u2014its\nexplicability according to mechanical causes\u2014does not show that\nit cannot be also accompanied by internal or mental events\n(Nanna: 79). \n\nA weak point of Fechner\u2019s argument is that he never sufficiently\nclarifies what he means by the soul or mind. His argument is cast in\nthe language of having \u201ca soul\u201d, which makes it seem as if\nhe means a special kind of substance. He tells us that by a soul\n(Seele) he means the same thing as mind (Geist); but\nthis only kicks the can down the road: What are the criteria of a\nmind? The crucial consideration for Fechner seems to be sentience,\nconsciousness or awareness, or at least the possibility of it. Even\nthe most primitive plants, he argues, have consciousness or feeling;\nthough it might not be on the level of humans and animals, it is still\nat least as lively and intense (Nanna: 188). This is\ninteresting because Fechner seems to exclude the possibility of the\nsubconscious; he does not allow, as Leibniz famously did, the\nexistence of subconscious living creatures. In some places, Fechner\nseems to hold that having feelings and desires are sufficient for the\npresence of a mind; but he also writes that there can be sensation and\ndesire without consciousness (Nanna: 53). In other places, he\nmakes purposive activity a necessary condition of having a mind. Only\na being with a soul has a purpose, he says (Nanna: 152). The\ncrucial consideration for an organism, he also contends, is that its\norganization allows it to effectively achieve its ends\n(Nanna: 191). But this too becomes troubled because Fechner\nconcedes that there can be purposive or organic development without\nany awareness of it (Nanna: 87).\n\nOne of the most important differences between Fechner\u2019s\npanpsychism and Schelling\u2019s and Hegel\u2019s idealism is that,\nfor Schelling and Hegel, the ideal does not necessarily imply the\npresence of consciousness. What makes a creature living is its\npurposive activity, which need not imply that its activity is directed\nby consciousness. These differences with the idealist tradition\neventually became public in Fechner\u2019s sharp criticism of Eduard\nvon Hartmann\u2019s Die Philosophie des Unbewussten, which\nput forward a strong case for the presence of subconscious life\nthroughout nature (see Fechner 1879:\n 22).[9]\n\n",
