    "main_text": "Instrumental Coherence || \u201cCognitivist\u201d Requirements on Belief\n3.4 \u201cCognitivist\u201d Requirements on Belief\n\nA fourth approach to explaining the Violation and Satisfaction Claims\nargues that the requirement violated, or satisfied, is, or is\nexplained by, requirements on belief exclusively. There are\ntwo components to this \u201ccognitivist\u201d approach: first,\nthere is some thesis about how intention involves belief, and, second,\nthere is some account of how the requirements governing those involved\nbeliefs constitute, or explain, the requirement to be instrumentally\ncoherent.\n\nHere are some candidates for the first component:\n\nStrong: If one intends to E, then one believes that one\nwill E.\nMedium: If one intends to E, then one believes that it is\npossible that one will E.\nWeak: If one intends to E, then one does not believe that\none will not E.\n\n\n(Cognitivist accounts developed with Strong, or a variant of it, are\nfound in Harman 1976, 1986; Velleman 1989, 2007; Setiya 2007; Broome\n2009; and Archer 2018. Earlier defenses of Strong can be found in\nHampshire and Hart 1958 and Grice 1971. Wallace 2006 develops a\ncognitivist account with Medium, and Binkley 1965 does so with\nWeak.)\n3.4.1 Strong\n\nLet\u2019s begin with Strong. Suppose I am instrumentally\nincoherent\u2014that is, I intend to E, believe I will\nE only if I intend to M, but don\u2019t intend to\nM. According to Strong, I believe\n\nI will E.\n\n\nWhen we pair this with my instrumental belief\n\nIf I will E, then I intend to M,\n\n\nand apply the theoretical rational requirement\n\nClosure:\nRationality requires that [if one believes P, and one\nbelieves P\u2009\u2192\u2009Q, then one believes\nQ].\n\n\nwe get the result that I am required to believe\n\nI intend to M,\n\n\nor drop either (1) or (2). If I drop (1), I would cease to intend to\nE (according to Strong) and thereby cease to be\ninstrumentally incoherent, and if I drop my instrumental belief (2), I\nwould also cease to be instrumentally incoherent.\n\nBut is coming to believe (3) enough to cease to be instrumentally\nincoherent? What if my belief is false? There are two options for the\ncognitivist at this point. The first would be to defend\n\nSelf-Fulfillment:\nIf one believes that one intends to M, then one intends\nto M.\n\n\nBut we might doubt that we are infallible in our beliefs about our own\nintentions (Bratman 2009b, \u00a74,5). After all, it seems that we can\nbe mistaken in our beliefs about other attitudes we have (see\nSchwitzgebel 2010, \u00a74).\n\nA second option for the cognitivist would be to say that having false\nbeliefs about one\u2019s own intentions is possible, but\ntheoretically irrational. (On this option, the cognitivist\napproach to instrumental coherence appeals to two theoretical\nrequirements: Closure plus some other requirement not to have false\nbeliefs about one\u2019s own intentions.) However, there is usually\nnothing necessarily incoherent about one\u2019s having a\nfalse belief. So, the challenge for cognitivists is to\nexplain why, in this particular case, there is. (This strategy is\npursued by Setiya 2007, 670\u2013671. For criticism, see Bratman\n2009a, \u00a74 and Brunero 2009, \u00a72.)\n\nAdditionally, one might worry that Strong is too strong. Suppose you\nintend to go shopping on Thursday but don\u2019t believe you intend\nthis and instead believe that you intend to go shopping on Friday.\nMaybe you\u2019ve temporarily forgotten that you\u2019ve recently\nchanged your mind, deciding to go on Thursday instead of Friday\n(Bratman 2009a, \u00a75). In this case, you might not believe you will\ngo shopping on Thursday. In light of this example, John Broome (2009,\n\u00a77) suggests the following\n\nVariant of Strong:\nIf one believes one intends to E, then one\nbelieves one will E.\n\n\nBut this wouldn\u2019t help the cognitivist if she aims to account\nfor the application of instrumental coherence to all intentions,\nincluding those we don\u2019t believe we have (Bratman 2009b,\n\u00a72). Additionally, both Strong and Variant of Strong seem\nvulnerable to counterexamples. Suppose I intend, and believe I intend,\nto carry out a difficult task. Knowing the difficulty involved, I\ncould intend to carry out the task but remain agnostic about whether I\nwill do so. Here\u2019s another counterexample: suppose I intend to\nstop by a bookstore on the way home, but know that once I\u2019m\nriding on my bicycle, I tend to go on \u201cautopilot.\u201d Aware\nof my absentminded tendencies, I might intend to stop by the bookstore\nwithout believing I will (Bratman 1987, 38\u201339; also discussed in\nHolton 2008, \u00a72). Since such intentions make applicable a\nrequirement of instrumental coherence, but don\u2019t involve a\nbelief in success, the cognitivist cannot explain why requirements of\ninstrumental coherence apply to these intentions.\n3.4.2 Medium\n\nNext, let us consider Medium. Suppose again that I am instrumentally\nincoherent\u2014that is, I intend to E, believe I will\nE only if I intend to M, but don\u2019t intend to\nM. By\n\nSelf-Knowledge:\nIf one does not intend to M, then one believes that one\ndoes not intend to M.\n\n\nI believe:\n\nI do not intend to M.\n\n\nLet us now suppose that the instrumental belief takes this form:\n\nIf I do not intend to M, then it is not possible for me\nto E.\n\n\nIf I satisfy Closure, then I believe:\n\nIt is not possible for me to E.\n\n\nHowever, since I intend to E, then, by Medium, I believe:\n\nIt is possible for me to E.\n\n\nThus, in believing (3) and (4), I violate:\n\nBelief Consistency:\nRationality requires that [if one believes not P, then\none does not believe P]\n\n\nThus, if one satisfies Closure, then one violates Belief Consistency\n(Wallace 2006).\n\nOne might object to Self-Knowledge, arguing that we aren\u2019t\nalways aware of what we fail to intend. One might falsely believe one\nintends the means (Bratman 2009a) or one might simply fail to notice\nthat one hasn\u2019t intended the means (Brunero 2005a). One response\navailable to the cognitivist would be to say that such lapses in\nself-awareness are possible, but are theoretically\nirrational. And so instrumental coherence would be explained\nby Closure, Belief Consistency, and the requirement to be aware of\none\u2019s absent intention in this context. While it wouldn\u2019t\nbe plausible to claim that rationality requires, in general, awareness\nof what one does not intend, it might be plausible to say that\nawareness of what one does not intend is rationally required in this\nspecific context (Wallace 2006, 118).\n\nOne might also object that if one is going to be a cognitivist about\npractical requirements in general, one must account for both\ninstrumental coherence and\n\nIntention Consistency:\nOne is required [if one intends not to E, then one does\nnot intend to E].\n\n\nBut Medium, on its own, does not seem sufficient to account for\nIntention Consistency. Such a conflict of intentions would involve the\nfollowing beliefs:\n\nIt is possible for me not to E,\nIt is possible for me to E,\n\n\nBut unlike those beliefs involved according to Strong, namely,\n\nI will not E,\nI will E,\n\n\n(5) and (6) are perfectly consistent with one another. I could\nconsistently believe it\u2019s possible that I not go to the game\ntonight, and possible that I go to the game tonight. So, we are still\nin need of an explanation of why I\u2019m rationally required to not\nboth intend not to go and intend to go (Bratman 2009b, \u00a73).\n\nOne might also raise doubts about Medium. Suppose I know I\nhaven\u2019t yet investigated whether the stores are closed for the\nholiday on Thursday, and so I haven\u2019t yet formed any beliefs\nabout whether I can go shopping then. Couldn\u2019t I still intend to\ngo shopping on Thursday? That might be irrational or careless planning\non my part, but it seems possible. (The example might prove even more\nconvincing if we add the feature of Bratman\u2019s example above:\nsuppose, forgetting about my change of mind, I believe I intend to go\nshopping on Friday, not on Thursday.) Perhaps doubts could even be\nraised, not just about whether intending to E involves\nbelieving E is possible, but also about whether intending to\nE involves not believing E is impossible.\nRichard Holton (2008), drawing on Anscombe\u2019s example from\nIntention (\u00a752) of a man who is certain he\u2019ll\nbreak down under torture but is determined not to break down, has\nargued that one could intend some end while believing that end\nisn\u2019t a \u201clive possibility.\u201d Such combinations,\nHolton argues, may be irrational, but aren\u2019t impossible.\n3.4.3 Weak\n\nNext, let us consider Weak. Suppose again that I am instrumentally\nincoherent\u2014that is, I intend to E, believe I will\nE only if I intend to M, but don\u2019t intend to\nM. By Self-Knowledge, I believe:\n\nI do not intend to M.\n\n\nWhen this belief is paired with the contrapositive of my instrumental\nbelief\n\nIf I do not intend to M, I will not E,\n\n\nClosure requires that I believe\n\nI will not E,\n\n\nor cease to believe (1) or (2). But since I intend to E, it\nfollows, by Weak, that I do not believe (3). Were I to comply with\nClosure by forming the belief (3), I would, according to Weak, thereby\ncease to intend to E. In ceasing to believe (2), I would\ncease to be instrumentally incoherent. And in ceasing to believe (1)\n(which, if Self-Knowledge is true, would mean that it is no longer the\ncase that I do not intend to M) I would also cease to be\ninstrumentally incoherent.\n\nSome of the objections mentioned above would also apply to this\naccount. There is the objection to Self-Knowledge. And\nAnscombe\u2019s example, exploited by Holton, also presents a\nchallenge to Weak, since the torture victim intends not to break down\nbut believes that he will.\n\nAdditionally, one might raise questions concerning the rationality of\nresponding to the violation of Closure in this context.\nUsually, if one discovers that one believes P,\nP\u2009\u2192\u2009Q, but does not believe\nQ, the rational way to proceed depends upon one\u2019s\nassessment of the relevant reasons for belief (where these are\nevidential, not pragmatic, reasons). Let us assume, for simplicity,\nthat P\u2009\u2192\u2009Q is a fixed background\nbelief. If one thinks there are really strong reasons for believing\nP and not strong reasons for not believing Q, then\nit would be irrational for one to refuse to believe Q and\ninstead to drop one\u2019s belief that P. Now, according to\nthis cognitivist account, when I\u2019m instrumentally incoherent, I\nbelieve (1) and (2) but not (3). How should I proceed? If I currently\ndo not intend to M, and if, as Self-Knowledge holds,\nI\u2019m infallibly aware of what I do not intend, then it seems that\nthe evidence I have for my belief that I do not intend to M\nis really quite strong. Let\u2019s assume (2) is a fixed background\nbelief. In revising in light of my assessment of the evidence, it\nseems that the revision could only proceed in one direction: by\nmodus ponens, coming to believe I will not E. It\nwould be irrational for me instead to proceed by modus\ntollens, ceasing to believe that I do not intend to M.\nSo, if we respond to violations of Closure in the usual way, we are\nleft with the counterintuitive result that there is only one way to\nescape a state of instrumental incoherence: by abandoning the end.\n\nFinally, one might also cast doubt on the general cognitivist strategy\nbeing employed here, whether it appeals to Weak, Medium, or Strong.\nMany of the same questions that we\u2019ve raised about instrumental\nincoherence could be raised about rational requirements on belief,\nincluding Belief Consistency and Closure. There are analogues of the\nViolation and Satisfaction Claims for these rational requirements that\nwould need to be defended and explained. For example, Joseph Raz\nquestions whether the analogue of the Violation Claim for Belief\nConsistency is even true (see Raz 2005b, \u00a73; Raz 2005a, \u00a75).\nIf one has a set of beliefs that is inconsistent, then at least one of\nthe beliefs in that set is false. But, Raz argues, it does not follow\nthat there is any revision in one\u2019s beliefs that one ought to\nmake. (Reflection on logical paradoxes, like the sorities paradox,\nshows that having an inconsistent set of beliefs doesn\u2019t imply\nthat there is any belief in the set that one ought to give up.)\nAlthough Raz objects to the cognitivist\u2019s appeal to Belief\nConsistency in particular, similar questions might be raised about the\ncognitivist\u2019s appeal to Closure.\n",
