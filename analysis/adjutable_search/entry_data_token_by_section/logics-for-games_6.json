    "main_text": "Overview || Zooming In\n1.6 Zooming In\n\nGames have a natural interface with logic in all its varieties,\nincluding mathematical, philosophical, and computational logic. In one\ndirection of contact, logic can provide new abstract notions\nunderneath game theory. Conversely, game-theoretic notions can also\nserve to enrich logical analysis. The present entry mainly\nconcentrates on the first of these directions, the use of logic for\nanalyzing games. It does so mostly from a semantic perspective, the\ndominant paradigm so far in the area. Though proof-theoretic\napproaches will be mentioned occasionally. The sections to follow\nelaborate on this theme along several dimensions. Specific\nperspectives include logics for game structures\n (Section 2),\n logical analysis of the nature of players\n (Section 3)\n and of the process of game play\n (Section 4).\n Additional spotlights are put on the relationship between logic and\nprobability in the context of games\n (Section 5)\n and the endeavor of Gamification\n (Section 6).\n Each section forms a free-standing exposition, which results in some\nunavoidable, and perhaps useful, overlap. Throughout the exposition,\nsome familiarity is assumed with the basic concepts of logic and game\ntheory. In particular, notions of game theory left unexplained here\ncan be found in the corresponding\n entry\n and in Leyton-Brown and Shoham\n(2008).\n\n",
