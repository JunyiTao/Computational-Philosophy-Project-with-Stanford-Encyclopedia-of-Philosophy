They are directly concerned with the kinds of outcomes a\njust society should pursue. These theories differ in the outcome\nmetrics they adopt\u2014the \u201ccurrency\u201d of distributive\njustice (Cohen 1989). Some adopt a resource metric (Dworkin 1981b);\nstill others, a metric based on opportunities for welfare (Arneson\n1989) or access to advantage (Cohen 1989). Finally, capability\ntheories assess outcomes not only by the goods or resources that\npeople have, but also by what people are able to do with what they\nhave (Nussbaum 1990; Sen 1980). Such outcome-oriented theories may be\nmore or less demanding, depending on whether they require equality or\nmerely priority for the worst-off, and on whether they support\nequality of a sort that may not require the significant redistribution\nof goods or resources.\n\nThe most prominent family of outcome-oriented approaches has been\ncalled \u201cluck egalitarianism\u201d (see, for example, Arneson\n2000; Dworkin 2003; Lippert-Rasmussen 2015). According to the dominant\ncharacterization of that position, its central claim is that it is\nunjust when there are unfair inequalities in the distribution of\n\u201cbrute luck\u201d\u2014an advantage or disadvantage with\nrespect to the relevant metric that is not attributable to an\nindividual\u2019s fault, choice, or assumption of risk. \u201cOption\nluck\u201d, in contrast, refers to an advantage or disadvantage an\nindividual acquires through the foreseeable consequences of his or her\nactions. The stronger versions of luck egalitarianism (e.g., Dworkin\n81b) deny that any inequality resulting from option luck generates\nclaims of justice. On those versions, only some disabilities generate\njustice claims\u2014those that resulted from brute bad luck (e.g.,\ncongenital impairments)\u2014whereas others, which may involve the\nsame or greater disadvantage, do not, simply because they resulted\nfrom a free choice (e.g., reckless pastimes or an unhealthy\nlifestyle).\n\nSome philosophers have taken these implications as a reductio ad\nabsurdum of luck egalitarianism (Anderson 1999), and they would\nno doubt be rejected by many writers on health care, who have\nquestioned the moral and policy relevance of individual responsibility\n(Cavallero 2011; Feiring 2008; Galvin 2002; Wikler 1987). The greater\nconcern for disability scholars may be with the conflation of\ndisadvantages resulting from unchosen impairments with disadvantages\nresulting from unchosen social conditions under the one heading of\n\u201cbad brute luck\u201d. Luck egalitarianism does not, as\nsuch, provide any principled rationale for distinguishing between\nequally severe setbacks to the well-being of people with disabilities\nthat result from the \u201cbad luck\u201d of being born in a society\nwith disability discrimination and the \u201cbad luck\u201d of being\nborn with an intrinsically disadvantageous set of physical\nabilities. Both are equally unchosen from the individual\u2019s\nstandpoint, and it is individual responsibility, rather than some\ncombination of individual and collective responsibility, that\ndetermines whether a given disadvantage generates a valid justice\ncomplaint. This is not to deny that luck egalitarianism can be\nsupplemented to account for the intuition that the \u201cbad\nluck\u201d of being born in a disabling environment (Fine and Asch\n1988) differs morally from less socially mediated forms of bad luck,\nas we will see in our discussion of the capabilities approach.\n",
