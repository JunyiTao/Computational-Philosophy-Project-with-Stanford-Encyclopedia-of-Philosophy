    "main_text": "Equality of Condition: Equality of What? || Resources\n3.5 Resources\n\n\nThe ideal of equality of resources can be understood by recognizing\nits primary enemies. These enemies comprise all manner of proposals\nthat suppose that in so far as we should care about equality of\ncondition across persons, what we should care about equalizing is some\nfunction of the utility or welfare or well-being or good that persons\nattain over the course of their lives. (There is a complication here,\nbecause the resource-oriented approach also opposes the capability\napproach, which so to speak stands midway between resources and\nwelfare. This raises the question whether the capability approach is\nan unstable compromise (see Dworkin 2000, chapter 7). This issue\nsurfaces for discussion eleven paragraphs down in this section.) John\nRawls offers an especially clear statement of the animating impulse of\nthe equality of resources ideal. He imagines someone proposing that\nthe relevant measure of people's condition for a theory of justice is\ntheir level of plan fulfillment or attained satisfaction, and responds\nthat his favored conception \u201ctakes a different view. For it does not\nlook behind the use which persons make of the rights and opportunities\navailable to them in order to measure, much less to maximize, the\nsatisfactions they achieve. Nor does it try to evaluate the relative\nmerits of different conceptions of the good. Instead, it is assumed\nthat the members of society are rational persons able to adjust their\nconceptions of the good to their situation.\u201d (See Rawls 1971, section\n15.) Resourcist ideals of equality of condition are non-welfarist.\n\n\nSeveral thoughts are intertwined here. One is that equality of\ncondition must be developed as a component of an acceptable theory of\njustice, intended to be the basic charter of a democratic society and\nacceptable to all reasonable members of such a society, who are\npresumed to be disposed to disagree interminably about many ultimate\nissues concerning religion and the meaning and worth of human life\n(Rawls 2005). We must seek reasonable terms of cooperation that people\nwho disagree about much can nonetheless accept. If there is anything\nthat people cannot reasonably be expected to agree about, it is what\nconstitutes human good, so introducing a controversial conception of\nhuman good as part and parcel of the ideal of equality that is to be at\nthe core of the principles of justice is a bad mistake.\n\n\nAnother thought is that responsible individuals will consider\nthemselves to have a personal obligation, which cannot be shifted to\nthe government or any agency of society, to decide for themselves what\nis worthwhile in human life and what is worth seeking and to fashion\n(and refashion as changing circumstances warrant) a plan of life to\nachieve worthwhile ends. So even if the true theory of human good could\nbe discovered, it would offend the dignity and sense of responsibility\nof individual persons for some agency of society to preempt this\nindividual responsibility by arranging matters so that everyone\nachieves human good understood a certain way to a sufficiently high\ndegree. Individuals should take responsibility for their ends. (See\nRawls 1971, Rakowski 1992, Dworkin 2000, and for a different view,\nFleurbaey 2008).\n\n\nAnother thought that motivates the family of equality-of-resources\nideals is that society's obligations by way of providing for its\nmembers are limited. A just and egalitarian society is not plausibly\nheld to be obligated to do whatever turns out to be necessary to bring\nit about that their members attain any given level or share of quality\nof life. The reason for this is that the quality of life (the degree to\nwhich one attains valuable agency and well-being goals) that any\nindividual reaches over the course of her life depends on many choices\nand actions taken by that very individual, so to a considerable extent,\nthe quality of life one reaches must be up to oneself, not the job of\nsociety or some agency acting on behalf of society. Along these lines,\nthe actual course of an individual's life and the degree of fulfillment\nit reaches also depend on many chance factors for which nobody can\nreasonably be held accountable. Justice is a practical ideal, not a Don\nQuixote conception that aims to correct all bad luck of any sort that\nbefalls persons. A reasonable morality understands the social justice\nobligations of society as limited, not open-ended and unbounded. So if\nequality of condition is part of social justice, it too must reflect an\nappropriately limited conception of social responsibility. Equality of\nresources fills this bill. (See Daniels 1990 and chapters 3 and 4 of\nBuchanan et al. 2000.)\n\n\nThe trick then is to develop an appropriate conception of resources\nthat can serve in an ideal of equality of condition.\n\n\nResources can be external, material goods, such as land and moveable\nproperty. One can also extend the domain, and consider traits of\npersons that are latent talents or instruments that help them to\nachieve their ends as also included within the set of resources to be\nequalized. Extending the domain in this way will introduce complexity\ninto the account, because personal talents are attached to persons and\ncannot simply be transferred to others who lack talent. What one can do\nis take people's variously valuable personal talents into account\nin determining how material resources should be distributed so as to\nachieve an overall distribution that should register as (sufficiently)\nequal. If Smith lacks good legs, this personal resource deficit might\nbe offset by assigning Smith extra resources so he can buy a wheelchair\nor other mobility device.\n\n\nNotice that in elaborating equality of resources, it is assumed that\na population of individuals with given traits, generated by genetic\ninheritance and early socialization, is present, and equalization is to\nproceed by adjusting features of the individuals' environment or by\naltering features of the individuals, say by extra education. But of\ncourse, moral questions may also be raised about the processes by which\nindividuals come to be born and given early socialization so as to\nendow them with certain traits. With genetic information about an\nindividual made available to prospective parents before the individual\nis born, a decision can be made about whether to bring this child to\nterm. In the future, genetic enhancements may be available that can\nalter the genetic makeup of individuals, and again a morality must\nconsider when enhancements should be supplied and by whom. Raising\nthese questions makes it evident that just assuming an initial\npopulation of individuals with given traits takes for granted matters\nthat are very much morally up for grabs (see Buchanan et al. 2000). For\nthe purposes of this entry, this complication is noted only to be set\naside.\n\n\nHow can resources be identified and rated? We want to be able to\nsay, given two persons each with different amounts of resources, which\none has more resources overall. The literature to date reveals two ways\nof confronting the question. One has been developed by John Rawls\n(Rawls 1971), one by Ronald Dworkin (Dworkin, 2000).\n\n\nRawls suggests that the conception of resources to be deployed in a\nresourcist ideal of equality is primary social goods. These are defined\nas distributable goods that a rational person prefers to have more\nrather than less of, whatever else she wants. (A variant conception\nidentifies them as goods that any rational person would want who gives\npriority to her interests in (1) cooperating with others on fair terms\nand (2) selecting and if need be revising a conception of the good and\na set of life aims along with pursuing the conception and the aims.) On\nthis approach it is not so far clear how to measure a person's holding\nof social primary goods overall if there are various primary goods and\none has different amounts of the different kinds. The primary goods\napproach has yet to be developed in detail. Rawls has suggested that\nthe scope of this problem of devising an index of primary goods is\nlessened by giving some primary goods, the basic liberties, priority\nover the rest. For the remainder, Rawls suggests that the relative\nweight of primary goods can be set by considering what people (regarded\nas free and equal citizens) need. (See Rawls 2001, section 17.)\n\n\nRawls does not propose the primary goods approach as adequate to\nguide us in figuring out what egalitarianism requires by way of\ncompensation for those with serious personal talent deficits. His\naccount assumes that we are dealing with normal individuals who enjoy\ngood health and have the normal range of abilities. In his account, the\nproblem of deciding what an egalitarian approach requires by way of\nhelping (for example) the disabled is to be handled separately, as a\nsupplement to the primary goods account.\n\n\nThe problem of the handicapped is the tip of the iceberg according\nto the capabilities approach advocate. All people vary enormously in\ntheir personal traits, and these traits interact with their material\nresources and other features of their circumstances to determine what\neach one is able to do and be with a given resource share. Since we\ncare about what we can do and be with our resources, merely focusing\nattention on the resources as the primary goods advocate does is\ninherently fetishistic. The Rawlsian focuses on the distribution of\nstuff, but we do not care about the distribution of stuff except\ninsofar as the stuff distribution affects the distribution of\ncapability or real freedom. This is in a nutshell the capability\napproach criticism of primary goods forms of resourcism.\n\n\nTo some this critique of resourcism appears unstable. The capability\ntheorist criticizes the resourcist for tying the idea of just\ndistribution to the idea of fair shares of resources, but resources are\nnot what ultimately matter to us. But this criticism can be turned\nagainst the capability theorist. Ultimately each of us wants to lead a\ngood, choiceworthy life, one that is rich in fulfillment, and not\nmerely to lead a life that has as its backdrop lots of options or\ncapabilities among which one can choose. One wants a good life, not\njust good options. More options in some circumstances might predictably\nlead to a worse life. With a moderate level of resources (or\ncapabilities) I might live well, whereas with more resources (or\ncapabilities) I might choose heroin or methamphetamine and live badly.\nUltimately we are concerned with welfare (living well) and only\nsecondarily with capabilities (abilities and opportunities to live\nwell). In this light, from the welfarist standpoint, the capability\napproach looks fetishistic, just as from the capability standpoint, the\nprimary goods approach to the measure of people's condition for\npurposes of deciding what constitutes an equal (or more broadly, a\nfair) distribution looks to be fetishistic. (The worry that the\ncapabilities approach is an unstable compromise, without endorsement of\nthe welfarist alternative, is voiced in Dworkin 2000, chapter 7.)\n\n\nThe Rawlsian will reply that it is not the proper business of\ngovernment to be rating and assessing people's personal traits as\nthe capabilities approach and welfarist approaches require. Respect for\npersons dictates that the state must respect its citizens by not\nlooking beyond resource shares to assess what individuals can do with\nthem and actually do with them (Carter 2011).\n\n\nDworkin's approach begins with the idea that the measure of a\nresource that one person holds is what others would be willing to give\nup to get it. From this standpoint competitive market prices are the\nappropriate measure of the resources one possesses: In particular, the\ndivision of a lot of resources among a group of people is equal when\nall are given equal purchasing power for the occasion and all the\nresources are sold off in an auction in which no one's bids are final\nuntil no one wants to change her bids given the bids of the others.\n\n\nThis equal auction is just a first approximation to Dworkin's\nproposal. Two complications need to be introduced. One is that one\nought to extend the domain of resources to include personal talents as\nwell as external property. A second is that equality of resources as\nconceived in this construction supposes that the results of unchosen\nluck, but not chosen option luck, should be equalized.\n\n\nTake the second wrinkle first. If we start from an initial equality\nof resources brought about by the equal auction mechanism, individuals\nmight then go on to use and invest and spend their resource allotments\nin various ways. Assume the rules mediating their interaction are set\nand morally unproblematic. Roughly speaking, we say people are free to\ninteract with others on any mutually agreeable terms but not to impose\nthe costs of their activities on others without the mediation of\nvoluntary consent. Starting from an initial equality of resources, any\nresults that issue from voluntary interactions reiterated over time do\nnot offend against the equality ideal. Let voluntary choice and chosen\nluck prevail.\n\n\nThe first wrinkle is that individuals differ in their unchosen\nnatural talent resource allotments. These should somehow be equalized.\nBut how? The Dworkin proposal is that we can in thought establish an\ninsurance market, in which people who do not know whether they will be\nborn disabled (afflicted with negative talents) and do not know what\nmarket price their positive talents will fetch, can insure themselves\nin a variant of the equal purchasing power auction against the\npossibility of being handicapped or having talents that fetch low\nmarket price. In this way in thought unchosen luck is transformed into\nmorally inoffensive chosen luck (so far as this is thinkable).\n\n\nThe final Dworkin proposal then is that the thought experiment of\nthe equal auction modified as above is used to estimate in actual\ncircumstances in a rough and ready way who is worse off and who better\noff than others through no choice of her own. A tax and transfer policy\nis instituted then that tries to mimic the results of the imaginary\nequal auction and hypothetical insurance market. To the extent that we\nestablish and sustain such policies\u2014voila!\u2014we have equality\nof resources across the members of an actual society. (See Dworkin\n2000).\n\n\nThe Dworkin proposal is noteworthy for its integration of themes of\nequality and personal responsibility in a single conception. But the\nmoral appropriateness of linking these themes in the particular way\nthat he espouses is open to question.\n\n\nOne concern arises from the theoretical role that hypothetical\ninsurance markets are to play in the determination of what is to count\nas equality of resources. This role assumes increasing prominence in\nDworkin's later work (Dworkin 2000, chapters 8\u201313; also Dworkin\n20\u201311, Part 5, especially chapter 16). Dworkin eventually defines the\nequal distribution of privately held resources as the one that would\nissue from an initial auction in which all have equal bidding power to\npurchase materials resources, supplemented by hypothetical insurance\nmarkets against the possibility of suffering the bad brute luck of\nhandicap or low marketable talent. From then on, ordinary market\nrelations govern relations among individuals, and their upshot does not\nimpugn the equality of the initial staring point unless new forms of\nbrute luck intervene. For these Dworkin imagines further hypothetical\ninsurance markets, in which the appropriate compensation for\npost-initial-auction bad brute luck is set by the average level of\ninsurance that people would have purchased if they knew the incidence\nof the bad brute luck, its impact on people, and the available devices\nfor mitigating it, but not their personal chances of suffering the bad\nbrute luck. Given this background, just policies in actual societies\nshould aim to mimic the results of these hypothetical equal mechanisms.\nIn this exercise, we seek to undo the effect of brute luck but not\noption luck, that former being luck that falls on you in ways beyond\nyour power to control and the latter being luck that you can avoid, and\nmaybe reasonably avoid, by voluntary choice.\n\n\nNotice the transition from (1) the insurance decisions you actually\nmake to (2) the insurance decisions you would have made under imagined\nequal circumstances to (3) the insurance decisions the average member\nof society would have made under hypothetical equal circumstances. One\nmight wonder for a start why the last of these should be normative for\ndetermining what we owe to Sally, who was raised in poverty and became\nparaplegic after a ski accident. Counterfactuals about what the average\nperson would have done are arguably of doubtful relevance and\ncounterfactuals about what a particular individual would have done in\nwildly different circumstances may generally lack truth value.\n\n\nThe distinction between brute luck and option luck does not exhaust\nthe possibilities. Most luck is a bit of both. Option luck varies by\ndegree, but it is unclear how the determination of equality of\nresources should accommodate this fact. Moreover, the insurance\ndecisions on which Dworkin's procedures rely clearly mix together\nthe brute and option luck he wants to separate. In deciding on\nhypothetical insurance for health care one will take account of the\nlikelihood that one will engage in imprudent behavior that will affect\none's health status.\n\n\nOthers point out that what insurance you would have purchased\nagainst a brute luck calamity might not intuitively align with the\ndifferent notion, what compensation for suffering the calamity is\nappropriate. The simplest way to see this is that for many people,\nmoney will have more use if one is healthy and normal than if one is\nplagued with physical disability, so given a hypothetical choice to\ninsure for handicaps, one might prefer an insurance policy that gives\none less income if one is handicapped and more income if one is not.\nThe insurance decision may be reasonable but the idea that on this\nbasis we ought to be forcibly transferring wealth away from handicapped\npeople and distributing the resources to the non-handicapped is\narguably not reasonable (Roemer 2002, and for more far-reaching doubts\nabout hypothetical insurance, Fleurbaey 2008).\n\n\nSetting to the side the details of Dworkin's construction, we\ncan ask about the prospects of the general project he pursues. The\nstarting point, which some had considered prior to Dworkin's\ncontribution, is to consider what we should count as an equal\ndistribution when people have different goods and they have different\npreferences over these goods. The basic idea is to treat as an equal\ndistribution of resources one which no one prefers to alter\u2014no\none prefers any other person's pile of resources to her own. This\nfairness test does not require interpersonal comparison of welfare,\nhence has an appeal if interpersonal comparison is incoherent or\nethically problematic. No-envy is not generally satisfiable, but there\nis a family of fairness norms that could be construed as egalitarian\ncriteria for assessing distributions and that is resourcist in the\nbasic sense of eschewing interpersonal welfare comparisons. Suppose we\ncan separate for each person her features for which she should be held\nresponsible and her features for which she should not be held\nresponsible. One fairness norm says that egalitarian transfers should\nnot vary depending on people's features for which they should be\nheld responsible. Another fairness norm says that people with the same\nfeatures for which they should be held responsible should be treated\nthe same. In the general case, we cannot fulfill both of these norms,\nbut a whole gamut of compromises between them can be identified and\nhave been studied (mainly by economists). The Dworkin view occupies\njust one point in a large space of possibilities. As is already\nevident, some of these criteria relax to some degree (or even entirely\ndispense with) the Dworkin insistence on personal\nresponsibility\u2014the idea that each person is responsible for her\nchoices in the sense that no one is obligated to make good the\nshortfall in her condition if her choices turn out badly.\n(Dworkin's account has an extra wrinkle here: each person is\nresponsible for her ambitions and what flows from them, and one's\nambitions are one's desires that one is glad to have, does not\nrepudiate). The vision of personal responsibility that is integral to\nDworkin's approach does not characterize the broader family of\nresourcist distributive fairness doctrines that eschews interpersonal\nwelfare comparisons and investigates variants of the no-envy test (see\nFleurbaey 2008 for an accessible survey and somewhat skeptical\nexploration, and Varian 1974 for an early contribution).\n\n\nGo back to the idea that a viable account of equal distribution must\nbe appropriately sensitive to personal responsibility by dictating\ncompensation for unchosen endowments but not for ambition and choice.\nThe most far-reaching skepticism on this point denies that personal\nresponsibility can be more than instrumentally valuable, a tool for\nsecuring other values. One might hold that in a world in which human\nchoices are events and all events are caused by prior events according\nto physical laws, responsibility can make sense pragmatically and\ninstrumentally in various settings but does not really make good\nnormative sense under scrutiny. One might reach a similar result by\nnoting that even if persons are truly responsible for making some\nchoices rather than others, what we could reasonably be held\nresponsible for and what surely lies beyond our power to control run\ntogether to produce actual results and cannot be disentangled. On this\nview, if we care about equality, we should seek not\nresponsibility-modified equality but straight equality of condition,\nusing responsibility norms only as incentives and prods to bring about\nequality (or a close enough approximation to it) at a higher level of\nmaterial well-being.\n\n\nAnother sort of skepticism challenges whether the broad project of\nholding people responsible for their chosen luck but not for their\nunchosen luck really makes sense, because unchosen luck of genetic\ninheritance and early socialization fixes the individual's\nchoice-making and value-selecting abilities. What one chooses, bad or\ngood, may simply reflect the unchosen luck that gave one the ability to\nbe a good or a bad chooser. Suppose for example that Smith chooses to\nexperiment with cigarettes and heroin, and these gambles turn out badly\nin the form of contraction of lung cancer and long-term hard drug\naddiction. He is then far worse off than others, but his bad fortune\ncomes about through his own choice\u2014hence is not compensable\naccording to Dworkinian equality of resources. But that Smith chooses\nthese bad gambles and Jones does not may simply reflect the unchosen\nbad luck that Smith had in his genetic inheritance and early\nsocialization. So holding him fully responsible for the fortune he\nencounters through chosen gambles may make no sense if we follow\nthrough the underlying logic of the Dworkin proposal itself. This takes\nus back to welfarist equality conceptions, which the resourcist\ntheorist wishes to steer away from at all cost (Roemer 1985 and\n1986).\n",
