    "main_text": "Neural networks || Systematicity and productivity\n4.3 Systematicity and productivity\nFodor and Pylyshyn (1988) offer a widely discussed critique of\neliminativist connectionism. They argue that systematicity and\nproductivity fail in connectionist models, except when the\nconnectionist model implements a classical model. Hence, connectionism\ndoes not furnish a viable alternative to CCTM. At best, it supplies a\nlow-level description that helps bridge the gap between Turing-style\ncomputation and neuroscientific description.\nThis argument has elicited numerous replies and\ncounter-replies. Some argue that neural networks can exhibit\nsystematicity without implementing anything like classical\ncomputational architecture (Horgan and Tienson 1996; Chalmers 1990;\nSmolensky 1991; van Gelder 1990). Some argue that Fodor and Pylyshyn\nvastly exaggerate systematicity (Johnson 2004) or productivity\n(Rumelhart and McClelland 1986), especially for non-human animals\n(Dennett 1991).  These issues, and many others raised by Fodor and\nPylyshyn\u2019s argument, have been thoroughly investigated in the\nliterature.  For further discussion, see Bechtel and Abrahamsen (2002:\n156\u2013199), Berm\u00fadez (2005: 244\u2013278), Chalmers\n(1993), Clark (2014: 84\u201386), and the encyclopedia entries on\n the language of thought hypothesis\n and on \n connectionism.\nGallistel and King (2009) advance a related but distinct\nproductivity argument. They emphasize productivity of mental\ncomputation, as opposed to productivity of mental\nstates. Through detailed empirical case studies, they argue that\nmany non-human animals can extract, store, and retrieve detailed\nrecords of the surrounding environment. For example, the Western scrub\njay records where it cached food, what kind of food it cached in each\nlocation, when it cached the food, and whether it has depleted a given\ncache (Clayton, Emery, and Dickinson 2006). The jay can access these\nrecords and exploit them in diverse computations: computing whether a\nfood item stored in some cache is likely to have decayed; computing a\nroute from one location to another; and so on. The number of possible\ncomputations a jay can execute is, for all practical purposes,\ninfinite.\nCCTM explains the productivity of mental computation by positing a\ncentral processor that stores and retrieves symbols in addressable\nread/write memory. When needed, the central processor can retrieve\narbitrary, unpredicted combinations of symbols from memory. In\ncontrast, Gallistel and King argue, connectionism has difficulty\naccommodating the productivity of mental computation. Although\nGallistel and King do not carefully distinguish between eliminativist\nand implementationist connectionism, we may summarize their argument\nas follows:\n\n Eliminativist connectionism cannot explain how organisms combine\nstored memories (e.g., cache locations) for computational purposes\n(e.g., computing a route from one cache to another). There are a\nvirtual infinity of possible combinations that might be useful, with\nno predicting in advance which pieces of information must be combined\nin future computations. The only computationally tractable solution is\nsymbol storage in readily accessible read/write memory\nlocations\u2014a solution that eliminativist connectionists\nreject.\n Implementationist connectionists can postulate symbol storage in\nread/write memory, as implemented by a neural\nnetwork. However, the mechanisms that connectionists usually\npropose for implementing memory are not plausible. Existing proposals\nare mainly variants upon a single idea: a recurrent neural network\nthat allows reverberating activity to travel around a loop (Elman\n1990). There are many reasons why the reverberatory loop model is\nhopeless as a theory of long-term memory.  For example, noise in the\nnervous system ensures that signals would rapidly degrade in a few\nminutes. Implementationist connectionists have thus far offered no\nplausible model of read/write \nmemory.[2]\n\nGallistel and King conclude that CCTM is much better suited than\neither eliminativist or implementationist connectionism to explain a\nvast range of cognitive phenomena.\nCritics attack this new productivity argument from various angles,\nfocusing mainly on the empirical case studies adduced by Gallistel and\nKing. Peter Dayan (2009), John Donahoe (2010), and Christopher Mole\n(2014) argue that biologically plausible neural network models can\naccommodate at least some of the case studies. Dayan and Donahoe argue\nthat empirically adequate neural network models can dispense with\nanything resembling read/write memory. Mole argues that, in certain\ncases, empirically adequate neural network models\ncan implement the read/write memory mechanisms posited by\nGallistel and King. Debate on these fundamental issues seems poised to\ncontinue well into the future.\n",
