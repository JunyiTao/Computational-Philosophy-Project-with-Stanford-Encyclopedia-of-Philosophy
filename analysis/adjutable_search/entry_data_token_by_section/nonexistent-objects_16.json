    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Nonexistent Objects: From Nonexistence to Abstractness || Nonexistence Does Not Hold the Key\n6. Themes for Further Investigation\n\nThere are several ways in which Meinongian object theory can be\ndeveloped further. Here are some of\n them:[39]\n\n1. Both MOT\\(^{ne}\\) and MOT\\(^{dc}\\) could perhaps benefit\nfrom a clarification of their basic distinctions, namely the\nnuclear-extranuclear distinction and the dual copula distinction,\nrespectively.\n\n2. One feature of Meinong\u2019s mature object theory not mentioned\nso far is the \u201cdoctrine of implexion\u201d. Implexion is a\nrelation between incomplete and complete objects which seems to be\nvery close to what is often called \u201cinstantiation\u201d, i.e.,\na relation between universals and particulars. Incomplete objects are\n\u201cimplected\u201d in complete ones. (See Meinong 1972,\n\u00a729.) Meinong himself eventually came to interpret incomplete\nobjects as universals (see Meinong 1972, 739f). Meinongian object\ntheory may thus be interpreted as a sophisticated theory of\nuniversals, in particular as a theory of types (as opposed to\nproperties), which might open further fields of application.\n\n3. Throughout this entry, we have presupposed realism with respect to\nproperties. However, it is doubtful whether a theory of Meinongian\nobjects is necessarily ontologically committed to properties.\nAn ontologically neutral quantifier and the use of non-objectual\nvariables for predicates (not for names of predicates or\nproperties) may help to avoid this commitment and thus could make\nMeinongian object theory much more parsimonious.\n",
