    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nThe goal of this essay is to survey and analyze the literature on\nstyle in history and philosophy of mathematics. In particular, the\nproblem of how one can philosophically approach the notion of\n\u2018style\u2019 in mathematics will be addressed towards the\nend. Although this is not one of the canonical topics in philosophy of\nmathematics, the presentation will avail itself of relevant\ndiscussions on style in the history and philosophy of science.\n\nSpeaking about mathematics in terms of style is a common enough\nphenomenon. One encounters such appeals to stylistic features in\nmathematics already early in the seventeenth century. Bonaventura\nCavalieri, for instance, as early as 1635 contrasts his indivisibilist\ntechniques with the Archimedean style:\n\nI know in fact that all the things mentioned above [Cavalieri\u2019s\nown theorems obtained by indivisibilist proofs] can be reduced to\nArchimedean style. (In the original Latin: \u201cScio autem\npraefata omnia ad stylum Archimedeum reduci posse.\u201d\n(Cavalieri 1635, 235)).\n\n\nLater in the century it is easier to find examples. For instance\nLeibniz (1701, 270\u201371) writes: \u201cAnalysis does not differ\nfrom Archimedes\u2019 style except for the expressions that are more\ndirect and more appropriate to the art of discovery\u201d (French:\n\u201cL\u2019analyse ne diff\u00e8re du style\nd\u2019Archim\u00e8de que dans les expressions, qui sont plus\ndirectes et plus conformes \u00e0 l\u2019art\nd\u2019inventer\u201d). It is an interesting fact that such\noccurrences predate the generalized use of the notion of style in\npainting, which only dates from the 1660s (sporadic occurrences, as\npointed out in Sauerl\u00e4nder 1983, are also found in the sixteenth\ncentury). Earlier in the seventeenth century the word of choice in\npainting was \u201cmani\u00e8re\u201d (see Panofsky 1924;\nEnglish translation (1968, 240)). Here are a couple of additional\nexamples from the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries. Chasles in\nhis Aper\u00e7u historique (1837) speaking about Monge\nsays:\n\nHe initiated a new way of writing and talking about this science.\nStyle, in fact, is so intimately welded to the spirit of a methodology\nthat it must advance in step with it; likewise, if it has anticipated\nit, style must of necessity play a powerful influence over it and over\nthe general progress of science. (Chasles, 1837, \u00a718, 207)\n\n\nAnother example comes from Edward\u2019s evaluation of\nDedekind\u2019s approach to mathematics:\n\nKronecker\u2019s brilliance cannot be doubted. Had he had a tenth of\nDedekind\u2019s ability to formulate and express his ideas clearly,\nhis contribution to mathematics might have been even greater than\nDedekind\u2019s. As it is however, his brilliance, for the most part,\ndied with him. Dedekind\u2019s legacy, on the other hand, consisted\nnot only of important theorems, examples, and concepts, but of a whole\nstyle of mathematics that has been an inspiration to each successive\ngeneration. (Edwards 1980, 20)\n\n\nObviously, one could pile up quotations of the same kind (see, among\nothers, Cohen 1992, de Gandt 1986, Dhombres 1993, Epple 1997,\nFerreir\u00f3s and Reck 2020, Fleckenstein 1955, Granger 2003,\nH\u00f8yrup 2005, Laugwitz 1993, Novy 1981, Reck 2009, Tappenden\n2005, Weiss 1939, Wisan 1981) but that would not be very\ninteresting. Even in mathematics style ranges from \u2018individual\nstyles\u2019 to \u2018national styles\u2019 to \u2018epistemic\nstyles\u2019, among others. What is needed is first of all an\nunderstanding of the major contexts in which appeal to\n\u2018style\u2019 in mathematics occurs, although this essay will\nnot contain much discussion of \u2018individual styles\u2019\n(examples of such would include, to follow a suggestion by Enrico\nBombieri, the \u201cvery personal\u201d styles of Euler,\nRamanujan, Riemann, Serre and A. Weil).\n\nIn many cases the appeal to the notion of style is conceived as\nborrowed from the fine arts and some cases will be discussed\nforthwith. Harwood 1993 claims that \u201cthe concept of style was\ndevised in order to classify cultural patterns observed in the study\nof fine arts\u201d. Wessely 1991 talks about \u201ctransferring that\nconcept [of style] to the history of science\u201d (265). While this\nmight perhaps be true for the twentieth century (see also Kwa 2012),\none should keep in mind, as was pointed out above, that this claim\nmust be qualified for the seventeenth century.\n",
