    "main_text": "No-go results in quantum gravity\n6. Conclusion\n\n\nHawking opined that \u201c[i]t seems there is a chronology \nprotection agency, which prevents the appearance of closed timelike \ncurves and so makes the universe safe for historians\u201d (1992a, \n603). He may be right, but to date there are no convincing arguments \nthat such an Agency is housed in either classical general relativity \ntheory or in semi-classical quantum gravity. And it is too early to \ntell whether this Agency is housed in loop quantum gravity or string \ntheory. But even if it should turn out that Hawking is wrong in that \nthe laws of physics do not support a Chronology Protection Agency, it\ncould still be the case that the laws support an Anti-Time Machine \nAgency. For it could turn out that while the laws do not prevent the \ndevelopment of CTCs, they also do not make it possible to attribute \nthe appearance of CTCs to the workings of any would-be time machine. \nWe argued that a strong presumption in favor of the latter would be \ncreated in classical general relativity theory by the demonstration \nthat for any model satisfying Einstein\u2019s field equations and energy \nconditions as well as possessing a partial Cauchy surface \n\\(\\Sigma_0\\) to the future of which there are CTCs, there are \nhole free extensions of \\(D^+ (\\Sigma_0)\\) \nsatisfying Einstein\u2019s field equations and energy conditions but \ncontaining no CTCs to the future of \\(\\Sigma_0\\). There are no doubt alternative approaches to\nunderstanding what it means for a device to be \u201cresponsible \nfor\u201d the development of CTCs. Exploring these alternatives is \none place that philosophers can hope to make a contribution to an \nongoing discussion that, to date, has been carried mainly by the \nphysics community. Participating in this discussion means that \nphilosophers have to forsake the activity of logical gymnastics with \nthe paradoxes of time travel for the more arduous but (we believe) \nrewarding activity of digging into the foundations of physics.\n\n\nTime machines may never see daylight, and perhaps so for principled \nreasons that stem from basic physical laws. But even if mathematical \ntheorems in the various theories concerned succeed in establishing \nthe impossibility of time machines, understanding why time machines \ncannot be constructed will shed light on central problems in the \nfoundations of physics. As we have argued in Section 4, for instance,\nthe hunt for time machines in general relativity theory should be \ninterpreted as a core issue in studying the fortunes of Penrose\u2019s \ncosmic censorship conjecture. This conjecture arguably constitutes \nthe most important open problem in general relativity theory. \nSimilarly, as discussed in Section 5, mathematical theorems related \nto various aspects of time machines offer results relevant for the \nsearch of a quantum theory of gravity. In sum, studying the \npossibilities for operating a time machine turns out to be not a \nscientifically peripheral or frivolous weekend activity but a useful \nway of probing the foundations of classical and quantum theories of \ngravity.\n",
