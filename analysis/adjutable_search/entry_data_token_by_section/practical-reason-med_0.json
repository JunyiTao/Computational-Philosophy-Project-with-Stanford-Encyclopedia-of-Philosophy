The Thomistic Doctrine of Practical Reason\n\nWhen one chooses through one\u2019s free will to live\n\u2018honorably and rightly\u2019 in accordance with divine law, one\ncan reasonably be thought to live a moral life. Despite the human\nability to reason according to divine principles, the human condition\ndoes not permit the attainment of moral perfection through natural\nmeans alone. Augustine asserts that only through grace, sent freely by\nGod to assist the human will can one achieve true moral goodness.\nPrudence, which is the ability to choose good and avoid evil,\nintellectual contemplation, moral and political virtue, friendship,\neducation and character (all essential elements in Aristotle\u2019s\nethics) are subsumed in Augustine\u2019s moral theology under the\ncommand to love God. For Augustine the complexity of Greek moral\nthought can be reduced to the simple rule of conformity to divine\nlaw.\n\nDespite the contributions of Anselm in the eleventh century on\nquestions concerning free choice, divine foreknowledge and\npredestination, and Peter Abelard\u2019s startling assertion in the\ntwelfth century that morality arises from the agent\u2019s intention\nalone, it is not until the thirteenth century that a thoroughly\nscientific approach to human moral reasoning takes shape.\nAristotle\u2019s Nicomachean Ethics, newly translated into\nLatin, provides a philosophical basis on which a fresh examination of\nAugustine\u2019s doctrines could be based (Wieland, 1981). The first\ngreat medieval commentary on Aristotle\u2019s ethics, which was the\nresult of Albert the Great\u2019s teaching activity at the Dominican\nHouse of Studies in Cologne, marks the beginning of \u2018moral\nscience\u2019 in the Middle Ages. Albert\u2019s careful exposition\nof Aristotle\u2019s text and his clarification of the concepts of\nnatural law, moral reasoning and human virtue, and its influence on\nhis most famous pupil, Thomas Aquinas, led directly to a consideration\nof the question of practical reasoning in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe notion of medieval practical reason can be investigated in two\nways: 1) in light of the distinction between practical and theoretical\nsciences in the writings of the medieval university masters in the\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries; 2) in comparison to the modern\nunderstanding of practical reason as described by Immanuel Kant. The\nfirst method allows for a strict adherence to the texts themselves,\nwherein the concept of \u2018ratio practica\u2019 is strictly\nlimited to a type of philosophical reasoning. The second approach\npermits a deeper philosophical consideration of the parallels between\nthe medieval understanding of the nature of moral goodness and the\nmodern view of the will as practical reason. Both approaches are\nhelpful in gaining a fuller understanding of the meaning of practical\nreason in the Middle Ages.\n\nIn its strictest sense the term \u2018practical reason\u2019\n(ratio practica) refers specifically to a type of reasoning,\nwhich is analogous to the deductions of speculative or theoretical\nscience. When discussing human knowledge of the precepts of natural\nlaw Thomas Aquinas argues that these commands are related to practical\nreasoning as the first principles of demonstration are related to\nspeculative reasoning; in each science there are certain principles of\ndemonstration which are known in themselves (principia per se\nnota). These principles, which comprise the universal laws of\nmoral behavior direct all subsequent moral reasoning. Thomas bases his\ntheory of correct reasoning on the human ability to discover an\nunderlying order in any field of inquiry. The order of reasoning which\ndetermines metaphysical knowledge is derived from a recognition of the\nprinciple of non-contradiction. Reasoning from the notion that being\nand non-being are contradictory terms, a metaphysician argues for\ncertain conclusions about the nature of being. In practical reason one\nbegins with the principle that all human acts are directed to an end\nand then comes to recognize the fundamental element of ethics to be\n\u2018do good and avoid evil\u2019:\n\nTherefore the first principle in practical reason is that which is\nbased on the nature of the good which is: the good is that which all\nthings seek. This therefore is the principle of law: that good must be\ndone and evil avoided. And on this <precept> all other precepts\nof natural law are based so that everything which is to be done or\navoided pertains to the precepts of natural law. Practical reason\nnaturally understands these precepts to be human goods. (S.\nth. I\u2013II, 94, 2).\n\n\nAlthough Albert sees a closer connection between prudence and\npractical reason than Thomas (\u201cprudence and practical reason\nhave the same acts in that reason gives the act while prudence informs\nthe act by reason of justice, expediency and honesty.\u201d De\nbono # 443), Albert essentially agrees with Thomas\u2019\ndescription of the method of practical reasoning (Super\nEthica, VI, 7, pp. 436\u2013437).\n\nThomas argues from the basic principle that what is a good always has\nthe nature of the end to the conclusion that human beings seek to\ndiscover particular good acts as consequences of the determined end.\nSince practical reason mimics the deductive process of theoretical\nreasoning, the term, \u2018ratio practica\u2019, primarily\nrefers to a type of human knowledge. There is, however, a fundamental\ndifference between the conclusions of theoretical and practical\nscience:\n\nBecause speculative reason is especially concerned with what is\nnecessary and cannot be otherwise, the truth found in its conclusions\nis without flaw, just <the truth> in its general principles. But\npractical reason concerns what is contingent whose domain is human\nacts; and so even if there is some necessity in its general\n<principles>, the more one descends to its proper conclusions\nthe more one finds a defect <in truth>. In speculative reasoning\nthe truth is the same for all, both in principles and in conclusions.\nIn operative reasoning there is not the same truth or practical\nrectitude according to its proper <conclusions>, but only\naccording to its common principles. (S. th. I\u2013II, 94,\n4; Super ethica, VI, 7, p. 441).\n\n\nSince the goal of practical reason is action not knowledge, the truth\nattained by the intellect must be caused by its conformity to right\ndesire. There can be no necessary science of practical reason, since\nvirtuous activity allows for variety and derivation from the universal\nrule in particular instances. Moral matters, which are within the\ndomain of practical reason, are varied and inadequate\n(deformis), and cannot therefore provide the certainty which\nis expected in theoretical reasoning. If we are to have any science of\npractical reason at all, we must be content to apply the principles to\nvarious conclusions and proceed from rough arguments which demonstrate\ntruth in a general way.\n\nThe variety and differences among the will\u2019s acts lead Thomas\nAquinas to use the term \u2018ratio practica\u2019\nspecifically to distinguish the method of moral reasoning from that of\nstrictly scientific knowledge:\n\nTherefore one finds something in practical reason which is related to\noperations just as a proposition in speculative reason is related to\nconclusions. (S. th. I\u2013II, 90, 1 ad 2).\n\n\nAlbert argues that despite the similarities in method between the two\ntypes of reasoning, the force of a practical conclusion depends more\non a particular desire than a universal principle. Since human desires\ndiffer so greatly, moral arguments are merely general and imperfectly\nformulated. (Super ethica, VI, 16, p. 491). These\ndistinctions which are derived from Aristotle\u2019s analysis of the\nnature of human knowledge, do not approach the understanding of\nscience found in the philosophy of Kant. For Kant, speculation does\nnot, and cannot, give us knowledge of being, nor should we begin with\nbeing as the object of science, as is seen in the medieval principle\nof existential non-contradiction. Kant restricts speculative science\nto a consideration of the laws of appearance. Practical science, or\npractical reason, in Kant\u2019s philosophy, however, is concerned\nwith freedom rather the natural good or the human end. Kant\u2019s\npractical reason attains the kind of rigor, based on pure a\npriori principles, which would be impossible in the ethics of\nAristotle, Albert and Thomas who are content with a science of\npractical reason whose domain is contingent and changeable acts. The\nsecure foundation which Kant sought for every moral choice would be\nconsidered beyond the scope of practical reason as formulated by the\nmedieval commentators on Aristotle\u2019s ethics.\n\nDespite their enthusiastic reception of Aristotle\u2019s works, the\nmedieval moralists did not grant him complete authority in moral\nreasoning. The flexibility of Aristotle\u2019s ethics, which Thomas\nhimself acknowledges, did not lead medieval writers to construct a\nmoral theory which, like Aristotle\u2019s, is based on societal\nnorms, tradition and human actions. The medieval moralists sought a\nmore secure foundation for determining ethical action than\nAristotle\u2019s appeal to the man of practical wisdom\n(phronimos). A modern author recognizes the tensions that\nexist in medieval ethical theory when he writes of Thomas Aquinas:\n\u2018How is it that Aquinas can seem so Aristotelian in his\ndescription of human action and yet be so Augustinian in his\ninsistence on the need for conformity to the eternal law?\u2019\n(Westberg, 34). The answer to this question lies the account of the\ngenesis of the human moral act and the conditions for its rectitude.\nPractical reason requires a foundation more secure than the accepted\npractice of human actions. In the search for that basis, Thomas and\nhis contemporaries construct a theory of practical reason far more\ncomplex than the mere designation of a type of intellectual reasoning;\nit becomes an account of the nature of moral goodness itself.\n\nThe designation of the will as rational appetite, its end as goodness\nand its relationship to the intellect are well-known features of\nmedieval followers of Aristotle and need not be treated at length\nhere. What is of more interest in a discussion of practical reason is\nthe analysis of those first principles which regulate moral reasoning.\nThomas in developing the ideas of his former teacher, Albert, insists\nthat the will must be moved by an end that is perceived as good.\n(S. th. I\u2013II, 6, 1 & 8, 1; Super ethica,\nVI, 7, pp. 436\u2013437). More specifically he argues that:\n\n\u2026 the good in common, which has the nature of the end, is the\nobject of the will. Therefore because of this element the will moves\nthe other powers of the soul to their acts. (S. th.\nI\u2013II, 9, 1)\n\n\nEven though the intellect moves the will by presenting the object to\nbe desired, the will itself has a natural inclination toward the good.\nThe ultimate human end, or supreme good, is beatitude, the perfect,\nall-encompassing human good. Such a supreme good could never be\nperceived by practical reason as evil. (S. th. I\u2013II,\n13, 6 & 10, 2 ad 3; Super ethica, VI, 17, p. 497). The\ndetermination of the human end as beatitude says very little about the\nfirst principles of practical reason upon which specific moral\njudgments should be based. When the will desires, it seems to want\nmore specific objects than the vague longing for beatitude. Thomas and\nAlbert specify their theory of volition by means of the doctrines of\nnatural law, synderesis, and prudence.\n\nThe source of the first principles in any science is a critical\nelement in determining the validity and nature of that science. In\nmoral reasoning the origin of the principles of actions not only\nreveals the understanding of the nature of goodness, but directs also\nall subsequent analysis as well. In Thomas\u2019 theory of practical\nreason the first principle of human actions is that of law:\n\nJust as reason is the first principle of human acts, so too in this\nreason something is the principle with respect to every other act.\nThus it is necessary for law to pertain principally and most\nextensively. The first principle in actions, for which there is\npractical reason, is the ultimate end. The ultimate end of human life\nis happiness or beatitude. It is necessary for law to reflect in the\nhighest degree that order which leads to beatitude. (S.th.\nI\u2013II, 90, 2)\n\n\nThe dictates of natural law have a direct bearing on the attainment of\nhuman fulfillment. Despite an overly optimistic view of how\nAristotelian happiness leads to eternal beatitude, R. McInerny (p. 34)\nrecognizes the connection between natural law and the goal of human\nlife: \u201cOf course natural law cannot be discussed without\npresupposing what was said earlier about the ultimate end. The\nprecepts of natural law have to do precisely with the end. In its\nproper sense, a precept is command to do precisely what will lead to\nan end.\u201d McInerny views the Aristotelian admonition to regard\nbeatitude as possible only insofar as it pertains to human beings to\nbe an admission that the ideal of happiness can only be imperfectly\nattained in this life. This statement allows for Thomas to subsume\nwhat Aristotle had to say of the good life into a richer vision of the\nultimate goal that overcomes the vicissitudes of life (McInerny, p.\n33). This interpretation is common among those who wish to see an\norderly progression from the life of virtue to perfect beatitude, but\nThomas\u2019 position is more complex. Thomas\u2019s comments on\nAristotle\u2019s text rightly distinguishes between happiness in its\nessential activity and a type of earthly beatitude that includes the\nbenefits of good fortune. On Aristotle\u2019s own position concerning\nhuman moral perfection Thomas claims that the Philosopher left the\nquestion of eternal bliss open because he did not deem it entirely\nwithin the sphere of philosophy. The role of prudence in the\nproduction of human happiness becomes more restricted in Thomas\u2019\ntheory than it does in Aristotle\u2019s ethics, since the prudential\nperson must follow the logical progression from the principles of\nnatural law to the deduction of specific actions. The freedom of the\npractically wise person to chose a life with elements from practical\nand theoretical activities is restricted by the obligation to pursue\nthe precepts of eternal law (Celano, 2007).\n\nAlbert formulates this position succinctly when he says,\n\u201cprudence is regulated by divine and human law.\u201d\n(Super ethica, VI, 4, p. 417). While no other law than the\ndictates of practical reason guides human choices, the eternal law\n(lex aeterna) primarily and principally orders a human being\nto the end and determines the corresponding means. As a result, acts\nthat are at odds with the eternal law must always be considered as\ncontrary to the dictates of practical reason. (S. th.\nI\u2013II, 71, 6 ad 3).\n\nThe insistence upon the binding force of eternal law and the natural\nhuman inclination towards, and participation in, it (which is called\nnatural law) marks a decisive step away from Aristotle\u2019s ethics\nof phronesis. The ground of moral action is no longer thought\nto be the conformity of conduct to that of an outstanding person\n(phronimos); it is found in an external and universally\nbinding source (eternal law). The process of correct practical\nreasoning is governed, and measured, by the conformity of acts to the\nprecepts of this law:\n\nA similar process is found in practical and speculative reason\u2026\njust as in speculative reason conclusions of diverse sciences are\nproduced from indemonstrable principles naturally known\u2026 so too\nfrom the precepts of natural law as if from certain common and\nindemonstrable principles human reason proceeds necessarily to those\nthings to which it should be more particularly disposed. (S.\nth. I\u2013II, 91, 3)\n\n\nThe recognition of the principles of natural law allows practical\nreason to demonstrate how a human being naturally participates in\neternal law according to its common principles.\n\nDeveloping ideas found in Albert\u2019s work, Thomas argues that the\nwill must be determined by its acceptance of the dictates of practical\nreason, which necessarily conform to the precepts of natural law:\n\nthat human reason rules the human will, by which its goodness is\nmeasured, comes from the eternal law, which is divine reason. Thus the\ngoodness of the human will clearly depends much more on eternal law\nthan on human reason, and where human reason is deficient it is\nnecessary to turn to eternal reason. (S. th. I\u2013II,\n19,5; Super ethica, VI, 4, p.417)\n\n\nThe content of the precepts, the way they are known and their\ninfluence on volition are the final elements in the natural law theory\nof practical reason. The assertion that natural law reflects eternal\nlaw gives little indication as to its specific precepts, but it does\nindicate that according to the order of natural inclinations an order\nof the precepts of natural law exists. There is in a human being, as\nin all other types of being, a primary inclination to\nself-preservation. It is, however, in the discussions of synderesis\nthat Thomas and Albert most clearly identify those principles which\nare the foundation of human moral reasoning. Synderesis was introduced\ninto Latin by Jerome, perhaps as a variant of the Greek term,\n\u2018syneidesis\u2019 (insight), and has no meaning\nwhatsoever in Greek. While Albert compares the moral principles of\nsynderesis to the innate natural seeds of law (seminaria\niuris), Thomas defines synderesis as \u201cthe law of our\nintellect insofar as it is a habitus containing the precepts\nof natural law which are the principles of human acts.\u201d\n(S.th. I\u2013II, 94, 1, ad 2). In an earlier work Thomas\nexplains synderesis either as a natural habit similar to the habit of\nprinciples, or as the power (potentia) of reason with such a\nhabit. He sees little difference in these two designations, since each\ndescribes the universal natural ability of reason to recognize the\nfirst principles of morality. The parallels to speculative reasoning\nthat marked practical reasoning are also a feature of deriving\nconclusions from the dictates of synderesis. Thomas\u2019 claim that\nthe function of synderesis is to recognize universal moral laws leaves\nlittle doubt that he understood the first principles of practical\nreason, natural law and synderesis to be the same:\n\nJust as there is a certain natural habit of the soul whereby it knows\nthe principles of speculative science, which we call the understanding\nof the principles, so too in the soul is there a certain natural habit\nof the first principles of actions, which are the natural principles\nof natural law; and this habit pertains to synderesis and exists in no\nother power than reason. (De veritate, q. 16, a. 1)\n\n\nThe specific dictate of synderesis which refers to the eternal law is\nthat one must obey God; the primary imperative with respect to the\nnatural law is that one should avoid evil and seek the good. These\nprinciples are obviously not mutually exclusive, \u2018but the\ndictate of reason to pursue good is rationally and necessarily derived\nfrom the command to obey God.\u2019 Synderesis is the ability of\nreason that never errs in the recognition of those universal rules of\nmoral action, since a denial of their universal validity contravenes\nhuman reason. Reason can, however, err in the application of the\nuniversal principle to a particular action. Moral wrong is then the\nresult of an imperfect, or false, deduction from the principle. So\nproperly speaking, error is not ascribed to universal principles\n(synderesis), but rather to conscience which may incorrectly apply a\nuniversal judgment. (De veritate, q. 16, a. 2, ad 2;\nSuper ethica VI, 7, p. 441; Hoffmann, 2012; Trottmann,\n2000).\n\nThe ability to apply correctly the principles of practical reason to\nspecific acts in particular circumstances is the function of the\nintellectual virtue of prudence, defined succinctly as recta ratio\nagibilium. Prudence \u201crepresents the agent\u2019s ability\nto deliberate, decide and properly to order the process of practical\nreason to action.\u201d (Westberg, p. 187). Prudence does not,\nhowever, direct the will infallibly to right conclusions. Since it\nmerely directs choices, but does not determine them, the will can be\nsaid to remain free. Thomas argues that the will can choose freely in\nthree ways, although it could never express a desire contrary to the\nprimary moral rule of pursuing good. The will can be mistaken 1) with\nrespect to its own act in that it can either will or not will; 2) with\nrespect to its object in that it can either want or not want a\nparticular thing; 3) with respect to what is ordered to the end\ninsofar as it wills a particular good or evil act. (De\nveritate, q. 16, a. 2, ad 2 & q. 16, a. 1). Thomas\u2019\ndescription of the will\u2019s freedom seems at times to be\noverwhelmed by his insistence upon the will\u2019s determination by\nthe human intellect. This theory of freedom seems to consist merely in\nthe human tendency for faulty reason, since both Albert and Thomas\nthink it unlikely, or even impossible, for a human being to choose\ncontrary to knowledge of the first principles and their application to\nparticular circumstances:\n\nIt should be said that the root of liberty is the will as subject, but\nreason as its cause. The will therefore can be freely drawn to diverse\nthings, since reason can be drawn to diverse things, since reason can\nhave various conceptions of the good. (S. th. I\u2013II, 17,\n1)\n\n\nFor Albert the delight that arises from intemperate desire does not\ncorrupt the natural habit of prudence, but rather its rule, when\nprudence fails in drawing the proper moral conclusion. In other words,\nno one can act contrary to the universal principles of morality, but\nonly in their particular application. (Super ethica, VI, 7,\np. 441).\n\nAccording to these views human freedom could never lead a human being\nto act contrary to his own interests. To choose against the principles\nof natural law would not constitute freedom, but rather foolishness.\nAlthough the will\u2019s natural inclination to pursue the good\npresented by the intellect does not compel the will to act, the\nmoralists of the natural law theory think it psychologically\nimpossible to choose something incompatible with a properly deduced\nconclusion of practical reason:\n\nA second necessity can be imposed on the will, namely the will must\nnecessarily chose x, if x must be pursued as good or\nx is to be avoided as evil.
