    "main_text": "Intentionalist Approaches\n2. Intentionalist Approaches\n\nThe chief problem facing intentional models of self-deception is the\ndynamic paradox, namely, that it seems impossible to form an intention\nto get oneself to believe what one currently disbelieves or believes\nis false. For one to carry out an intention to deceive oneself, one\nmust know what one is doing; to succeed, one must be ignorant of this\nsame fact. Intentionalists agree that self-deception is intentional\nor, at least, robustly purposive, but divide over whether it requires\nholding contradictory beliefs and, thus, over the specific content of\nthe alleged intention involved (see\n \u00a73.2 Revision of Belief).\n Insofar as even the bare intention to acquire the belief that\np for reasons having nothing to do with one\u2019s evidence\nfor p seems unlikely to succeed if directly known, most\nintentionalists introduce some sort of temporal or psychological\npartition to insulate self-deceivers from their deceptive stratagems.\nWhen self-deceivers are not consciously aware of what they truly\nbelieve or intend, it\u2019s easier to see how they can play the role\nof the deceiver and the deceived. By dividing the mind into parts,\ntemporally or psychologically, these approaches seek to show that\nself-deception does not involve paradox.\n",
