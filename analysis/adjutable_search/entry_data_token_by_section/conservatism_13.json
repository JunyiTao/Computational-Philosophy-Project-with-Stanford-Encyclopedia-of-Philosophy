When Minogue argues that\n\n\nthe conservative enjoys the resources of his culture and is not\nforever fidgeting about big changes promising a better life\n(2009);\n\n\nsocialist critics respond that those in poverty cannot be said to\n\u201cenjoy\u201d many resources at all, and so any aspiration they\nhave for big changes cannot be \u201cfidgeting\u201d. The socialist\ncritic points out that when Oakeshott describes conservatism as a\n\u201cdisposition\u201d to enjoy the present, Manchester factory\nworkers of the 1840s, or slum dwellers in contemporary Mumbai or\nMexico City, would find little to enjoy. As O\u2019Hear (1998)\ncomments, those who see society riddled with defects are impatient\nwith conservative resistance to change; for them, the conservative\nemphasis on human ignorance and traditional wisdom is an evasion at\nbest.\n\nSocialists point out that the status quo is itself a construction.\nThis indeed is Kant\u2019s view, when he writes that \n\n\nOne must take people as they are, our politicians tell us, and not as\nthe world\u2019s uninformed pedants or good-natured dreamers fancy\nthat they ought to be. But as they are ought to read as we have made\nthem by unjust coercion, by treacherous designs which the government\nis in a good position to carry out. (Kant 1792)\n\n\nFor Neiman,\n\n\nmuch of our experience is\u2026often deliberately\nconstructed\u2026 in order to perpetuate a social system that\nbenefits the very people who say it\u2019s inevitable. (Neiman 2011:\n148\u20139)\n Neiman also comments that, \u201cthe rights of man have\ncome to guide us far more than [Burke] could ever have imagined\u201d\n(Neiman 2011:148).\n\n\nMarxists reject Burke\u2019s inference that since all social\nprocesses and institutions are interconnected, change must be\ncautious; they conclude instead that to change anything, one must\nchange everything. For Marx in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis\nBonaparte, tradition is a dead weight:\n\n\nMen make their own history, but [not] under circumstances chosen by\nthemselves\u2026The tradition of all dead generations weighs like a\nnightmare on the brains of the living. (Marx 1852: 15)\n\n\nBut writers on the left have found value in some conservative ideas.\nRaymond Williams\u2019 Culture and Society (1971) begins by\nshowing the lessons that Burke offers. And while rejecting its\nconclusion that change can only be piecemeal, many on the left share\nconservatism\u2019s distrust of rational planning. While Lenin aimed\nto impose a socialist blueprint through a vanguard party of\nspecialists, his Marxist critics Luxemburg and Kollontai held that\nrevolutionary tasks are unknowable in advance:\n\n\nGiven the uncertainty of the endeavour, a plurality of experiments and\ninitiatives will best reveal which lines of attack are\nfruitful\u2026[and produce] a creative, conscious\u2026and\nempowered working class. (Scott 1998: 187\u20139)\n\n\nOn this view, radical change need not involve a fixed blueprint. (G.A.\nCohen is another Marxist writer who finds value in conservative ideas,\nas we see in section 4. below.)\n",
