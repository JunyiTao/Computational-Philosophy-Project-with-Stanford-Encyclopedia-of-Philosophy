The Formative Period \nAbu\u2019l Fath\u0323 \u02bfUmar ibn Ibr\u0101h\u012bm Khayy\u0101m, commonly known as Umar Khayy\u0101m, is the best known Iranian poet-scientist in the West. He was born in the district of Sh\u0101dyakh of Naysh\u0101b\u016br (originally \u201cNaysh\u0101p\u016br\u201d) in the province of Khor\u0101s\u0101n sometime around 439 AH/1048 CE,[1] and died there between 515 and 520 AH/1124 and 1129 CE.[2] The word \u201cKhayy\u0101m,\u201d means \u201ctent maker,\u201d and thus, it is likely that his father Ibr\u0101h\u012bm or forefathers were tent makers. Khayy\u0101m is said to have been quiet, reserved, and humble. His reluctance to accept students drew criticism from opponents, who claimed that he was impatient, bad tempered, and uninterested in sharing his knowledge. Given the radical nature of his views in the Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, he may merely have wished to remain intellectually inconspicuous.\n\nThe secrets which my book of love has bred,\nCannot be told for fear of loss of head;\nSince none is fit to learn, or cares to know,\n\u2018Tis better all my thoughts remain unsaid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (Rub\u0101\u2018iyy\u0101t, Tirtha 1941, 266)\n\nKhayyam\u2019s reference to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 as \u201chis teacher\u201d has led some to speculate that he actually studied with Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. Although this is incorrect, several traditional biographers indicate that Umar Khayyam may have studied with Bahmany\u0101r, an outstanding student of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101.[3]\nFollowing a number of journeys to Herat, Ray, and Is\u0323fah\u0101n (the latter being the capital of the Seljuqs) in search of libraries and in pursuit of astronomical calculations, Khayyam\u2019s declining health caused him to return to Naysh\u0101b\u016br, where he died in the district of Sh\u0101dy\u0101kh.\n",
