    "main_text": "Theories of Mind || Seeds in the Mental Stream\n5.4 Seeds in the Mental Stream\n\n\nThe theory of seeds (b\u012bja) in the mental stream, which\nis associated with the Sautr\u0101ntikas, represents a direct response\nto the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika efforts toward an unified account of\ncausality and momentariness. A \u2018seed\u2019 in this case stands\nfor two sets of phenomena: (1) latent dispositions underlying the\nkarmic process; and (2) the capacity or power of certain causal chains\nto bring about a given result. Unlike the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da\nconcept of appropriation, the notion of seeds is used here only in a\nconventional sense and thus does not designate any real element of\nexistence whether associated with, or dissociated from, thought.\nTaking memory as an example, Vasubandhu explains the metaphorical use\nof the notion of seeds in the mental stream as simply designating\n\u201cthe capacity for recollection to arise originating from\nexperiential knowledge\u201d just as, for instance, sprouts have the\ncapacity \u201cto produce a grain of rice from a previous grain of\nrice\u201d (AKBh ad V 1d-2a).\n\n\nThe theory of seeds in the mental stream thus provides a mode of \ntalking about causality that does not exclude the notions of latency \nand disposition. By applying the organic imagery that is associated with \nseeds and sprouting to mind and mental phenomena the \nSautr\u0101ntikas open the door for an understanding of mentation as \na dynamic and creative process. A causal account of the mental \nconditioning has thus been supplemented by a dispositional account of\nmental states (even though ultimately these dispositions are not \nreally true factors of existence). Furthermore, given the association\nof intentional mental states with consciousness or cognitive \nawareness, cognitive events are regarded as the main force sustaining\nand perpetuating the life cycle, even though Buddhist traditions also\nadmit that in certain states of meditative absorption there is no \nmental activity. For the Sautr\u0101ntikas it is the body with its \nsense organs and various other conditioning factors that are \nappropriated in consciousness, ensuring thus that some type of \nmentation whether in a conscious, subliminal, or subtle mental form \n(viz., dreamless sleep), is always ongoing. A debate only arises when\nconsidering the causal mechanism that permits the emergence of \nconsciousness from cessation.\n\n\nThe debate between the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas and the \nSautr\u0101ntikas concerning the emergence of consciousness from the \nattainment of cessation casts further light on the theoretical \npositions of these two schools regarding the nature of mind and mental phenomena. \nDrawing from the canonical literature, Buddhaghosa describes the \nattainment of cessation (P\u0101li, nirodha-sam\u0101patti) \nas \u201cthe non-occurrence of consciousness and its concomitants \nowing to their progressive cessation\u201d (Path to Purity,\n23, 18; \u00d1\u0101namoli 1956, 824), in which progressive cessation\nstands for all three types of activities (viz., physical, mental, and\nverbal). The Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika position is that in the attainment\nof cessation there are no mental events. Given the \nVaibh\u0101\u1e63ika's commitment to the causal account of the \nhomogeneous and immediately antecedent condition \n(samanantarapratyaya), which states that mental events have \nas the necessary condition for their occurrence an immediately \npreceding mental event within the same mental series, he must answer \nthe following questions, clearly identified by Griffiths (1986, 61): \nDoes the last moment of consciousness prior to the attainment of \ncessation \u201cposses an immediately antecedent and homogeneous \ncondition but is not itself one?\u201d And, conversely, does the \nfirst moment of consciousness following the attainment of cessation \noccur \u201cwithout an immediately antecedent and homogeneous \ncondition while itself being one for the moment that follows \nit?\u201d\n\n\nThe Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika answers these questions, again, by appealing\nto the theory of the trans-temporal existence of dharmas and the \npossibility of a temporal separation between an immediately \nantecedent condition and its effects: thus, even in the case of \nlonger (that is, non-momentary) temporal discontinuities in the \nmental stream, the causal principle of the immediately antecedent \ncondition ensures that consciousness arises again from an instance \nsimilar to the one that preceded the attainment of cessation (cf. \nGriffiths 1986, 63).\n\n\nThe main point of disagreement between the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika and \nthe Sautr\u0101ntikas concerns the possibility of causation at a \ndistance: that is, whether it is possible for the cognitive awareness\npreceding the attainment of cessation to serve as the immediately \nantecedent condition for the arising of consciousness after \ncessation. In assuming that mental activity is absent in the \nattainment of cessation, the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas explain continuity\nin the mental stream by appealing to the principle of causation at a \ndistance, specifically by relying on their trans-temporal view of \ndharmas. Furthermore, for the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, given that they\naccept the existence of past dharmas, the thought of cessation \n(sam\u0101patticitta) becomes the immediately antecedent and\nhomogeneous condition for the thought of awakening \n(vyutth\u0101nacitta). \n\n\nFor their part, the Sautr\u0101ntika accept neither causation at a \ndistance nor the existence of constitutive elements of experience in\nall three temporal dimensions. Rather, as Vasubandhu and his \ncommentators Ya\u015bomitra and Sthiramati argue, the consciousness \nthat emerges immediately following the attainment of cessation has as\nits cause the physical body: this is because mind and body are in a \nconstant and reciprocal relation of causation, that is, \u201cthe \nmind and the body with its perceptual systems mutually seed one \nanother\u201d (AKBh ad II 44d; Poussin 1980, vol. I, 212). \nOther Sautr\u0101ntikas, such as Vasumitra, content that in effect a \nsubtle form of consciousness continues even after the attainment of \ncessation, for to assume otherwise would be equivalent to claiming \nthat life can continue without consciousness (an untenable position \nfor the Buddhist).\n\n\nThe Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika rebuttal to the notion that some subtle \nform consciousness persists even after the attainment of cessation \npoints to the tripartite nature of the dependently arising cognitive \nphenomena: cognitive awareness, being inherently intentional, is \nalways directed toward an object, and whenever there is contact with \nsuch an object there is feeling and apperception. In response, the \nSautr\u0101ntika insists that not all contact leads automatically to \nsensation (as is the case with advanced contemplatives such as the \nArhats) and furthermore that the notion of attainment itself \n(sam\u0101patti) in fact implies the presence of a conscious\nstate of the attainment of cessation. That state of attainment is not\nsustained by any substantive elements of existence (viz., the \ntrans-temporal dharmas of the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ika) but rather by \nthe thought of attainment itself (sam\u0101patticitta). It \nis this thought of attainment that prevents, for as long as a \nmeditator is able to sustain it, the arising of any other thoughts. \nThe attainment of cessation, then, is simply a temporary state of \nnon-mentation.\n\n\nNeither the theory of appropriation nor that of seeds in the mental \nstream seem to offer a satisfactory account of non-mentation. The \nlimitations of the two views are clearly spelled out by Sthiramati \n(see \u1e6cik\u0101 ad AKBh VIII, 33): First, in the case \nof the Vaibh\u0101\u1e63ikas, consciousness or the arising of \nconsciousness cannot have as its immediately antecedent and \nhomogeneous condition the cessation of consciousness for that \nviolates the causal principle itself, even assuming that body and \nsensory systems provide a basis for this arising. Second, by claiming\nthat consciousness can indeed arise from the body and its sensory \nsystems, the Sautr\u0101ntikas fall short of identifying the specific\ncause which assures (on the basis of the causal principle of the \nhomogeneity of the species) that consciousness arises at precisely \nthe right moment. Even assuming that mind and body seed each other \nprior to the attainment of cessation, there is no causal mechanism to\nexplain why a particular type of consciousness arises and not \nanother: in the absence of a cause that ensures the homogeneity of \nthe species, with just the body and its sensory systems as the basis,\nany type of consciousness could arise, rendering the causal process \nrandom and arbitrary. The function of the causal principle of the \nhomogeneity of the species is precisely that of ensuring that, say, \nwhen visual system and visible object come together, it is visual \nconsciousness rather than auditory or olfactory consciousness that \narises [for a detailed analysis of the complex issues surrounding the\nattainment of cessation, see Griffiths 1986, 66 and passim].\n\n",
