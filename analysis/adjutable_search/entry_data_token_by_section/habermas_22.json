    "main_text": "The Discourse Theory of Law and Democracy: Between Facts and Norms || The System of Rights\n4.4 The System of Rights\n\nHabermas argues that, alongside the principle of democracy, what he\ncalls a \u201clogical genesis of rights\u201d arises from the\n\u201cinterpenetration\u201d of the legal form and the discourse\nprinciple (D) (1992b [1996b: 121]). The argument is hard to follow. It\nbegins from the premises of (D) and the form of modern law, and\nassumes that the idea of legitimate law presupposes that of a legal\nsubject qua bearer of rights, no matter what the content of those\nspecific rights is. The conclusion to the argument is a system of\nrights, of five different kinds.\n\nBasic rights to the greatest possible measure of equal individual\nliberties.\nBasic rights to membership in a voluntary association of\nconsociates under law.\nBasic rights to the actionability of rights arising from the legal\nprotection of rights-holders.\nBasic rights to the equal opportunity to participate in the\nprocesses of political will formation and the production of legitimate\nlaw.\nBasic rights to living conditions that are socially,\ntechnologically, and ecologically safeguarded, insofar as this is\nnecessary for citizens to exercise their civil rights 1\u20134\n(1996b: 123\u20134).\n\n\nThe first three rights are supposed to arise theoretically from the\napplication of the discourse principle to the form of law. These are\nrights that citizens must grant to one another if they are\n\u201clegitimately to regulate their living together by means of\npositive law\u201d (1992b [1996b: 126; 82; 118]). The next\ntwo\u2014political and social rights\u2014are practical and material\nenabling conditions that ensure the effectiveness of the first three\nrights. The first three rights, Habermas claims, are not specific\nrights, but what he calls \u201cunsaturated placeholders\u201d for\nspecific rights that have to \u201cbe interpreted and given concrete\nshape\u201d by actual citizens in response to determinate historical\nconditions (1992b [1996b: 125\u20136]). This is crucial to\nHabermas\u2019s theory, because it purports to reconstruct the\nability of citizens, from their perspective, to reciprocally grant one\nanother the rights necessary for their common existence as consociates\nunder law. That\u2019s why he claims that he, unlike Rawls,\ndoesn\u2019t design \u201cthe basic norms of a well-ordered society\non the drafting table\u201d, and then apply them to society (1990d\n[1994: 101]). In that sense, just as discourse ethics leaves the\nvalidation of moral norms to participants in discourse, the discourse\ntheory of law and democracy has to leave the political process of\nestablishing a system of rights up to citizens themselves as much as\npossible. This is the sense in which Habermas claims the discourse\ntheory of democratic legitimacy is \u201cstrictly procedural\u201d\nand more modest than \u201cnormative political theory\u201d \u00e0\nla Rawls (Habermas 1995: 117 & 132; Rawls 1995: 175\u2013177).\nFor all that, unlike in discourse ethics where neither (U) nor (D)\nhave the status of valid moral norms, Habermas nonetheless derives a\nsystem of rights that for all the world resembles T. H.\nMarshall\u2019s Whiggish account of civic, political, and social\nrights, in his classic work of political sociology (Marshall\n1950).\n",
