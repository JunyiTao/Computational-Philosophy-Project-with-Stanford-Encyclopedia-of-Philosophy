    "main_text": "Logic || Role of Logic\n2.1 Role of Logic\n\nVery little has been written about Suhrawardi\u2019s logical\ntreatises or his logic in general, namely because most of his logical\nworks remain unedited, and few scholars of Islamic philosophy delve\ninto logic. Hussein Ziai (1990) provides perhaps the only general\noverview of his logic, his criticisms of Peripatetic\n(Aristotelian/Avicennan) essentialist definitions and his\nishraqi theory of definition. While Suhrawardi includes\nlogical discussions in his major Arabic works, in the Philosophy\nof Illumination, he criticizes and restructures some elements of\nPeripatetic logic. For Shahrazuri (1988), his works bear the marks of\nextensive study of the Nasiri Observations of Ibn Sahlan\nal-Sawi (1988, 378), a non-Aristotelian Persian Logician who\nreorganized the content of the Organon. The work may have\ninspired Suhrawardi\u2019s restructuring of the logic, in\nIntimations, into expository propositions, wherein definition\nand description become part of his semantic theory, and theory of\nproofs (hujaj) (Ziai 1990, 45, 51\u20136). Noteworthy is\nZiai\u2019s reconceptualization of Suhrawardi\u2019s pragmatic use\nof logic into three parts: semantics, formal logic and techniques, and\nmaterial logic (Ziai, 1990, 73\u201375).\n\nThe Philosophy of Illumination does not follow the customary\ntripartite logic, physics, and metaphysics division of many\nPost-Avicennan Peripatetic works. It is divided into two main parts.\nThe first part, divided into three \u2018discourses\u2019,\nintroduces \u2018Rules of Thought\u2019 that cover not only logic,\nbut also some elements of physics and metaphysics (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a77\u2013106). The seven rules of the first discourse are\non knowledge and definition (see 2.2 below) (PI,\n\u00a7\u00a77\u201315). The first five rules pertain to logic and\ndeal with subject matter found in the Isagoge and derived\nfrom the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition (Ziai 1990, 58\u201367).\nFirst, Suhrawardi introduces elements of semantics, where are\ndiscussed problems of meaning, the distinction between conception and\nassent, and on the nature, definition and description of\n\u2018reality\u2019 (haqiqa), the latter being equated by\nQutb al-Din Shirazi (d.1311) with quiddity (mahiyya). Then,\nhe discusses accidents, universals (his nominalist ontology), and the\ninnate (fitriyya) and acquired nature of human knowledge\n(intuition, personal revelation, and inspiration being prior in\nessence, while logic being applicable only to the latter) (Mousavian\n2014a, 478; cf. Walbridge 2014; Mousavian 2014b). \n\nThe seven sections of the second discourse pertain to proofs and their\nprinciples (PI, \u00a7\u00a716\u201333). Suhrawardi\nintroduces short discussions to describe propositions and syllogisms,\nthe classes and the modalities in propositions. He proposes to reduce\nall types of propositions to necessary affirmative propositions. He\ncriticizes the Peripatetics\u2019 understanding of negation and\ndiscusses the differences between the Peripatetics and his novel views\nregarding a number of sophisms, for example, reducing the second and\nthird figures to the first figure, and reducing modal propositions to\none form. Street (2008, 165, 175) also showed that Suhrawardi\n\u201creduces all his modal propositions to the appropriate\ndefinitely necessary version\u201d in accord with Avicenna\u2019s\nsyllogistic; this enables him \u201cto express the truths of\nessentialism\u201d befitting for his \u201cessentialist\nmetaphysics\u201d, thus making him a \u201cdefender and\nexpositor\u201d Avicenna\u2019s modal logic. He also discusses\ncontradiction, conversion, conditionals, demonstrative syllogisms, and\nreductio ad absurdum, the latter also discussed in the third\ndiscourse (Ziai 1990, 67\u201372). In Intimations, he\ndescribes the distinct syllogistic forms used in dialectics, rhetoric,\nand poetics, for example, the non-demonstrative syllogism of poetry\ndue to its imagined and non-scientific premises (Ziai 1990, 54). \n\nThe third discourse presents sophistical refutations of errors\nuncovered in the formal and material logic of Peripatetic logic (an\nepitome of the Sophistical Refutations of the Organon)\n(PI, \u00a7\u00a734\u2013106). The third section deals with\na number of his ishraqi judgements against a number of\nPeripatetic issues of physics and metaphysics (see 3. and 4.). It also\nserves to establish certain \u201ctechnical terms\u201d (substance\nand accident, necessity and contingency, cause, and possible and\nimpossible infinities) (PI, \u00a752\u20135), and on\n\u2018beings of reason\u2019 (i\u2018tibarat\n\u2018aqliyya) (existence, necessity, etc.) (PI,\n56\u201368). Suhrawardi also revisits the classical theory of the\ncategories, adopting a reduced non-Peripatetic classification of five\ncategories: \u2018substance\u2019 (jawhar),\n\u2018quantity\u2019, \u2018quality\u2019, \u2018relation\u2019\n(similar to Stoic reduction of categories to those four, cf. Walbridge\n1996, 527), to which he adds \u2018motion\u2019 (absent in Ibn\nSahlan), the latter four being accidental categories (PI,\n\u00a771; Suh. 1993a, 4\u201312, 284\u201393; Ziai 1990, 72 n.2, 73\nn.3; Beidokhti 2018, 394\u2013400). An \u2018intensity\u2019 (or\nperfection) is predicated of those five categories, such that the\ndegree of intensity (with its corollary \u2018weakness\u2019) of\nlight becomes a property of substances as well as of accidents (Ziai\n1990, 73\u20135). \n",
