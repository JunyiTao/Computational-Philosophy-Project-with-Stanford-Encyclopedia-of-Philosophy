    "main_text": "Natural Expression, Beauty and Hedonic Theory\n5. Natural Expression, Beauty and Hedonic Theory\n\nThere is another respect in which Croce\u2019s notion of expression\nas intuition departs from what we ordinarily think of in connection\nwith the word \u2018expression\u2019. For example we think\nunreflectively of wailing as a natural expression of pain or grief;\ngenerally, we think of expressive behaviour or gestures as being\ncaused, at least paradigmatically, by the underlying emotion or\nfeelings. But Croce joins a long line of aestheticians in attempting a\nsharp distinction between this phenomenon and expression in art.\nWhereas the latter is the subject of aesthetics, the former is a topic\nfor the natural sciences\u2014\u2018for instance in Darwin\u2019s\nenquiries into the expression of feeling in man and in the\nanimals\u2019 (PPH 265; cf. Aes. 21, 94\u20137).\nIn an article he wrote for the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\nspeaking of such \u2018psychophysical phenomena\u2019, he\nwrites:\n\n\u2026such \u2018expression\u2019, albeit conscious, can rank as\nexpression only by metaphorical licence, when compared with the\nspiritual or aesthetic expression which alone expresses, that is to\nsay gives to the feeling a theoretical form and converts into\nlanguage, song, shape. It is in the difference between feeling as\ncontemplated (poetry, in fact), and feeling as enacted or undergone,\nthat lies the catharsis, the liberation from the affections, the\ncalming property which has been attributed to art; and to this\ncorresponds the aesthetic condemnation of works of art if, or in so\nfar as, immediate feeling breaks into them or uses them as an outlet.\n(PPH 219).\n\n\nCroce is no doubt right to want to distinguish these things, but\nwhether his official position\u2014that expression is identical to\nintuition\u2014will let him do so is another matter; he does not\nactually analyze the phenomena in such a way as to deduce, with the\nhelp of his account of expression, the result. He simply asserts it.\nBut we will wait for our final section to articulate criticisms.\n\nCroce\u2019s wish to divorce artistic expression from natural\nexpression is partly driven by his horror at naturalistic theories of\nart. The same goes for his refusal to rank pleasure as the\naim, or at least an aim, of art (Aes. 82\u20136). He does\nnot of course deny that aesthetic pleasures (and pains) exist, but\nthey are \u2018the practical echo of aesthetic value and\ndisvalue\u2019 (Aes. 94). Strictly speaking, they are dealt\nwith in the Philosophy of the Practical, that is, in the theory of the\nwill, and do not enter into the theory of art. That is, if the\ndefining value of the Aesthetic is beauty, the defining value\nof the Practical is usefulness. In the Essence of\nAesthetic (EA 11\u201313) Croce points out that the\npleasure is much wider than the domain of art, so a definition of art\nas \u2018what causes pleasure\u2019 will not do. Croce does speak of\nthe \u2018truly aesthetic pleasure\u2019 had in beholding the\n\u2018aesthetic fact\u2019 (Aes. 80). But perhaps he is\nbeing consistent. The pragmatic pleasure had in beholding beauty is\nonly contingently aroused, but in point of fact it always is aroused\nby such beholding, because the having of an intuition is an act of\nmind, and therefore the will is brought into play.\n",
