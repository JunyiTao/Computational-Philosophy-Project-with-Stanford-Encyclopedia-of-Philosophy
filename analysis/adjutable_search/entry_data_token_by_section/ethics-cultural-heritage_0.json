    "main_text": "What is Cultural Heritage?\n1. What is Cultural Heritage?\n\nCultural heritage is a broad and nebulous concept, and discussions\noften assume an understanding meant to capture its heterogeneity. For\ninstance, a representative definition reads as follows:\n\n\nHeritage encompasses a broad and overarching term: \u201cit\u201d is\nsomething that someone or a collective considers to be worthy of being\nvalued, preserved, catalogued, exhibited, restored, admired. (Kersel\n& Luke 2015: 71)\n\n\nHowever, although a commonplace understanding of cultural heritage is\nassumed in many discussions, attention to these conceptual assumptions\ncan also yield criticisms with moral and political implications. The\nfollowing subsections cover some of the conceptual questions that are\nraised about what precisely cultural heritage is.\n",
