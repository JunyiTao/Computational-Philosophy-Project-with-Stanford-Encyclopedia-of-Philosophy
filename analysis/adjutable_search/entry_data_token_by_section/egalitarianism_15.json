    "main_text": "Is Equality Desirable Per Se? Alternatives to Egalitarianism || Desert\n6.3 Desert\n\n\nEgalitarian transfers will in some circumstances be recommended by\nyet another principle that cares nothing for equality per se (Kagan\n1999 and 2012). This is the principle of desert: It is desirable\nthat each person should gain good fortune corresponding to her virtue\n(deservingness). As construed here, the desert principle\npresupposes that individuals' virtue is cardinally interpersonally\nmeasureable. A number can then be assigned to each person indicating\nthat person's level of virtue; persons assigned higher numbers have\ngreater virtue. Suppose that for each number there is a specific amount\nof good fortune or well-being that an individual with that number\nindicating her amount of virtue deserves to have. This is the level of\ngood fortune that corresponds to one's virtue. This level is higher for\nthe more virtuous, lower for the less virtuous. (One might allow that\nvery non-virtuous persons deserve some level of bad fortune or negative\nwell-being.)\n\n\nSuppose one adds to the desert principle the further norm that when\na person has less than she deserves, it is morally more valuable to\ngain an increment of good fortune for that person, the greater the gap\nbetween what she has and what she deserves. Call the further norm the\ngreater gap principle. Just as the prioritarian regards it as morally\nmore valuable (a matter of greater moral urgency) to gain a benefit for\na person, the worse off in absolute terms she would otherwise be, the\ngreater-gap desertitarian as just characterized holds that it is\nmorally more valuable (a matter of greater moral urgency) to gain a\nbenefit for a person, the greater the shortfall (if any) between the\nbenefit level she has and the benefit level she deserves. Accepting the\ndesert principle and the greater gap principle, one will then sometimes\nfavor egalitarian transfers purely from considerations of desert.\n\n\nJust as someone might fail to notice that in some situations both\npriority and equality will both recommend equalizing transfers, and so\nwrongly think that she favors the transfer in these situations because\nshe values equality per se, someone might fail to notice that in some\nsituations desert and equality will both recommend equalizing\ntransfers, and so wrongly think that she favors the transfer in these\nsituations because she values equality per se. The situation is\nclarified when one considers examples in which priority and equality\ndisagree about what ought to be done, and examples in which desert and\nequality disagree about what ought to be done. Shelly Kagan presses the\nproposal that when we consider a wide range of views and examples, we\nshould conclude that bringing it about that people should get good\nfortune corresponding to their virtue rightly commands our allegiance\nand bringing it about that people get the same or have the same does\nnot rightly command our allegiance.\n\n\nKagan poses many examples and tests our responses to them (Kagan\n1999 and 2012). An important range of examples involves situations in\nwhich a person is badly off, but has more than he deserves, and another\nperson is well off, but has less than he deserves. Kagan suggests that\nfor each person at a given level of deservingness, there is some\nabsolute level of benefit or well-being that is exactly what the person\ndeserves. From the standpoint of desert, getting this amount is ideal,\nbetter than getting either more or less. Kagan calls this level of\nbenefit for a person with a specified deservingness score that\nperson's peak. Now consider a saint who is very well\noff, but is way below her peak, and consider a sinner who is very badly\noff, but still is far beyond her peak. The sinner enjoys more good\nfortune than she deserves, the saint less. Now we face a choice: we can\nhelp either the sinner or the saint but not both. An advocate of\nequality says, help the badly off person, the sinner. An advocate of\npriority will say the same. Kagan suggests to the contrary that we\nshould regard it as morally the better course of action to aid the\nsaint, who has less than she deserves, rather than to help the sinner,\nwho already has more than she deserves. Kagan suggests that rewarding\ndesert trumps any moral imperative to equalize (or\n\u201cprioritize\u201d). Kagan adds a further suggestion: that\ngetting what one deserves matters more, the more deserving one is. The\nsinner's getting less than she deserves is less of a big deal,\nmorally speaking, than the saint's getting less than she\ndeserves.\n\n\nIn reply: the advocate of equality (or priority) might stiff-arm the\nidea that people should get what they deserve. Maybe in a diverse\nmodern society any standard of virtue will be contestable, and so not a\ngood building block for constructing fundamental moral principles.\nMaybe we are all determined by prior conditions and causes to behave\njust as we do, and this fact properly understood should lead us to hold\neither that the idea of being deserving lacks clear sense or that\neveryone's deservingness score is the same. On either view,\nrewarding the deserving is not a moral imperative. At most doing this\nwill be a means to other goals, not desirable for its own sake.\n\n\nEven if we cannot endorse the flat denial that rewarding the\ndeserving has any moral value, we might give this norm decisively\nsubordinate status. One suggestion along this line denies the idea that\nthere are \u201cpeaks\u201d\u2014a level of benefit for each person\nsuch that his becoming better off is bad from the standpoint of desert.\nInstead we might say that desert only establishes a comparative ranking\namong individuals. Being deserving or undeserving enhances or dampens\nthe moral reason to bring it about that one gains further benefits or\navoids further losses, but never to the point that gaining further\nbenefits or avoiding further losses has negative value. So to speak,\nbeing more or less deserving puts one toward the front or rear of the\nline of people eligible for benefits, but does not ever make one\nmorally ineligible for a better life. Along the same line, one might\nallow that desert reasons compete with equality or priority reasons,\nbut give decisively less weight to desert reasons.\n",
