Gerda Lerna argues that to understand how prostitution evolved\nhistorically, we need to understand \u201cits relationship to the\nsexual regulation of all women in archaic states and its relationship\nto the enslavement of females\u201d (Lerner 1986: 124). Lerner\nwrites\n\n\nIt is likely that commercial prostitution derived directly from the\nenslavement of women and the consolidation and formation of classes.\nMilitary conquest led, in the third millennium B.C., to the\nenslavement and sexual abuse of captive women. As slavery became an\nestablished institution, slave-owners rented out their female slaves\nas prostitutes, and some masters set up commercial brothels staffed by\nslaves. (Lerner 1986: 133)\n\n\nLerner speculates that prostitutes and concubines were used by rulers\nas symbols of wealth and power, and this practice was then emulated by\nother men of wealth and status (Lerner 1986: 133). Paupers were often\nforced to sell children, adding to the supply of labor for this\npurpose. Furthermore, as women\u2019s social respectability and\nmarriageability became tied to their chastity, \u201ccommercial\nprostitution came to be seen as a social necessity for meeting the\nsexual needs of men\u201d, (Lerner 1986: 134). In short, women who\nbecame prostitutes in ancient societies were typically enslaved,\ncaptive, or poor.\n\nGayle Rubin traces the origins of modern prostitution to the rise of\npatriarchal kinship systems in which women are exchanged as gifts\namong families to cement social bonds (Rubin 1975: 175). Rubin\nwrites\n\n\nIf women are the gifts, then it is men who are the exchange partners.\nAnd it is the partners, not the presents, upon whom reciprocal\nexchange confers its quasi-mystical power of social linkage. The\nrelations of such a system are such that women are in no position to\nrealize the benefits of their own circulation. As long as the\nrelations specify that men exchange women, it is men who are the\nbeneficiaries of the product of such exchanges\u2014social\norganization. (Rubin 1975: 174)\n\n\nIn other words, in the very creation of society, women were allegedly\nsubordinated through ritual exchange in order to create bonds of\nkinship among men as the foundation of the social order. Rubin\nwrites\n\n\nThe \u201cexchange of women\u201d is a seductive and powerful\nconcept. It is attractive in that it places the oppression of women\nwithin social systems, rather than biology. Moreover, it suggests that\nwe look for the ultimate locus of women\u2019s oppression within the\ntraffic in women, rather than within the traffic in merchandise.\n(Rubin 1975: 175)\n\n\nTrafficking in women to create social bonds among men, on\nRubin\u2019s account, explains women\u2019s social subordination as\nwives and ultimately, and as nonfamilial sexual servants.\n\nBoth Lerner\u2019s and Rubin\u2019s accounts link the rise of\nprostitution to the subordination of women, and overlook the\nenslavement and prostitution of men, both in ancient and modern\nsocieties. Lerner\u2019s account fails to explain why female slaves\nwere sexually exploited more than male slaves. Rubin does not explain\nwhy women, rather than men or opposite-sex pairs, were exchanged or\n\u201ctrafficked\u201d in early kinship systems, and thus her\naccount begs the question in regard to the rise of patriarchal kinship\nand political systems (Shrage 1994: 105, 131\u201332). While\nconsumers of commercial sexual services have been predominantly male\nthroughout history, factors other than gender subordination have\ninfluenced whose sexual labor was bartered or sold, such as\ncolonialism and racial subordination (Kempadoo 1999). By trying to\nexplain contemporary sex commerce in terms of the subordination of\nwomen, these accounts overlook important historical and cultural\ndiscontinuities. For example, commercial sex providers have not always\nbeen regarded as ineligible for marriage and have, in some places,\nbeen integrated into their communities to a high degree (Shrage 1994:\n109, 115; White 1990: 19; Rossiaud 1988: 70).\n\nCarol Pateman deploys the concepts of liberal political theory to\nexplain the existence of prostitution in modern societies. She argues\nthat the social contract, which establishes the rights and freedoms of\nmen in a liberal political order, also establishes the terms of\nwomen\u2019s subjection. In particular, the patriarchal social order\nincludes an implicit agreement among men that grants them sexual\naccess to women (Pateman 1988: 2). Men acquire sexual rights to\nparticular women through marriage and prostitution. In other words,\nmen have a class privilege\u2014a right to sexual relief from\nwomen\u2014which they can exercise by asserting their rights as\nhusbands or johns. Like Lerner and Rubin, Pateman challenges the\nnotion that prostitution results from men\u2019s biologically driven\nbehavior, and instead explains prostitution as the incorporation of a\nparticular conception of masculinity into modern political and social\nstructures (Pateman 1988: 198\u201399). In this way, modern\nprostitution represents the survival of some aspects of older\nilliberal social orders within the modern liberal state. Both\ntraditional marriage and prostitution, for Pateman, Lerner, and Rubin,\ngive men access to and control over the sexual capacities of\nwomen.\n\nKamala Kempadoo argues that \u201cthe global sex trade cannot be\nsimply reduced to one monolithic explanation of violence to\nwomen\u201d (Kempadoo 2001: 28). Kempadoo claims that older feminist\nmodels, which see prostitution as reflection of male power backed up\nby a monopoly on the use of physical force, are \u201cinadequate to\ncapture the various histories, oppression, and experiences of women of\ncolor\u201d (Kempadoo 2001: 35, 37). Kempadoo examines how histories\nof racism, colonialism, militarism, and globalization structure the\nchoices of first and third-world women of color. Although Kempadoo\nurges feminists to understand prostitution in terms of a broader range\nof social forces, she maintains that feminist theorizing about\nprostitution should avoid overlooking the agency of women of color by\ntreating them as mere passive victims of oppression (Kempadoo 2001:\n43). Kempadoo writes\n\n\nThe agency of Brown and Black women in prostitution has been avoided\nor overlooked and the perspectives arising from these experiences\nmarginalized in dominant theoretical discourse on the global sex trade\nand prostitution. Our insights, knowledges, and understanding of sex\nwork have been largely obscured or dominated by white radical\nfeminist, neo-Marxist or Western socialist feminist inspired analyses\nthat have been either incapable or unwilling to address the\ncomplexities of the lives of women of color. (Kempadoo 2001: 40)\n\n\nRather than conceptualize prostitution in terms of the sexual\nexploitation and degradation of women, Kempadoo advocates\nunderstanding prostitution as a kind of labor that is often performed\nby marginalized people (Kempadoo 2001: 45; Kempadoo and Doezema 1998:\n4\u20135; see also Leigh 1997). In this way, prostitution is similar\nto labor performed in other industries, such as agriculture,\nmanufacturing, or transportation. By analyzing prostitution as a form\nof labor, rather than a form of social decay or evil, feminists can\navoid unrealistic abolitionist approaches (Kempadoo and Doezema 1998;\nWhite 1990; Shrage 1996).\n\nA number of feminist theorists analyze prostitution and trafficking in\nterms of neoliberal and neocolonial economic relationships, in which\nwomen from poor countries in the global south are conscripted to\nprovide \u201ccomfort and recreation\u201d for military personnel\nand other men from rich nations in the global north. Sometimes social\nelites in poor nations tolerate and promote their own \u201csex\ntourism\u201d enterprises, in which local women provide sexual labor\nto attract foreign capital (Enloe 1989: 36, 86; O\u2019Connell\nDavidson 1998: 75; Bishop and Robinson 1998). Laura Agust\u00edn\ncautions feminists not to conflate voluntary (though illegal) migrants\nwho are seeking more lucrative forms of sex work with trafficked women\n(Agust\u00edn 2007). Although poor, third-world (and second-world)\nwomen are often exploited by traffickers, some may be choosing to\nmigrate and work in sex businesses over other occupations available to\nthem (factory or domestic work) both in their home and target\ncountries. Harsh laws against trafficking often exacerbate the plight\nof voluntary migrant sex workers who may be undocumented and working\nillegally (Kotiswaran 2011; Rajan 2003; Kempadoo and Doezema 1998).\nAnti-trafficking and anti-prostitution efforts should focus on\neliminating forced work and migration, child labor, exploitative\nworking conditions, and hostile legal environments for migrants and\nsex workers (Kotiswaran 2011: 47\u20138).\n\nBecause sex workers often come from marginalized social groups, their\nbasic rights as workers and citizens are frequently violated (Butler,\nC. 2015). Feminist theorists who recognize sex work as a legitimate\nchoice that some people make, among a constricted set of opportunities\nin order to earn a living, also recognize that sex markets can take\nmany forms. In some cases those who supply the labor are relatively\nfree and empowered agents, and in other cases they are not. The\nchallenge is to devise policies that prevent the recruitment of\nchildren and socially vulnerable people as providers, and that also\nprotect the rights of those who enter such markets even with informed\nconsent.\n",
