    "main_text": "\n\nGeorg (Gy\u00f6rgy) Luk\u00e1cs (1885\u20131971) was a literary\ntheorist and philosopher who is widely viewed as one of the founders\nof \u201cWestern Marxism\u201d and as a forerunner of 20th-century\ncritical theory. Luk\u00e1cs is best known for his Theory of the\nNovel (1916) and History and Class Consciousness (1923).\nIn History and Class Consciousness, he laid out a\nwide-ranging critique of the phenomenon of \u201creification\u201d\nin capitalism and formulated a vision of Marxism as a self-conscious\ntransformation of society. This text became a reference point both for\ncritical social theory and for many currents of countercultural\nthought. Even though his later work did not capture the imagination of\nthe intellectual public to the same extent as his earlier writings,\nLuk\u00e1cs remained a prolific writer and an influential theorist\nin his later career and published hundreds of articles on literary\ntheory and aesthetics, not to mention numerous books, including two\nmassive works on aesthetics and ontology. He was also active as a\npolitician in Hungary in both the revolution of 1919 and during the\nevents of 1956. Today, his work remains of philosophical interest not\nonly because it contains the promise of an undogmatic,\nnon-reductionist reformulation of Marxism, but also because it\ncombines a philosophical approach that draws on Neo-Kantianism, Hegel,\nand Marx with an acute cultural sensitivity and a powerful critique of\nmodern life inspired by Weber\u2019s and Simmel\u2019s sociological analyses\nof modern rationalization.\n",
