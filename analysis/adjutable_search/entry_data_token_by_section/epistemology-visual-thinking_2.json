    "main_text": "Visual thinking and proof\n3. Visual thinking and proof\nIn some cases, it is claimed, a picture alone is a proof (Brown\n1999: ch. 3). But that view is rare. Even the editor of Proofs\nwithout Words: Exercises in Visual Thinking, writes \u201cOf\ncourse, \u2018proofs without words\u2019 are not really\nproofs\u201d (Nelsen 1993: vi). Expressions of the other extreme are\nrare but can be found: \n [the diagram] has no proper place in the proof as\nsuch. For the proof is a syntactic object consisting only of sentences\narranged in a finite and inspectable array. (Tennant 1986)\n\nBetween the extremes we find the view that, even if no picture\nalone is a proof, visual representations can have a non-superfluous\nrole in reasoning that constitutes a proof. (This is not to deny that\nthere may be another proof of the same conclusion which does not involve\nany visual representation.) Geometric diagrams, graphs and maps, all\ncarry information. Taking valid deductive reasoning to be the reliable\nextraction of information from information already obtained, Barwise\nand Etchemendy (1996:4) pose the following question: Why cannot the\nrepresentations composing a proof be visual as well as linguistic? The\nsole reason for denying this role to visual representations is the\nthought that, with the possible exception of very restricted cases,\nvisual thinking is unreliable, hence cannot contribute to proof. Is\nthat right?\nOur concern here is thinking through the steps in a proof, either\nfor the first time (a first successful attempt to construct a proof)\nor following a given proof. Clearly we want to distinguish between\nvisual thinking which merely accompanies the process of thinking\nthrough the steps in a proof and visual thinking which is essential to\nthe process.  This is not always straightforward as a proof can be\npresented in different ways. How different can distinct presentations\nbe and yet be presentations of the same proof? There is no\ncontext-invariant answer to this. Often mathematicians are happy to\nregard two presentations as presenting the same proof if the central\nidea is the same in both cases. But if one\u2019s main concern is\nwith what is involved in thinking through a proof, its central idea is\nnot enough to individuate it: the overall structure, the sequence of\nsteps and perhaps some other factors affecting the cognitive processes\ninvolved will be relevant.\nOnce individuation of proofs has been settled, we can distinguish\nbetween replaceable thinking and superfluous thinking, where these\nattributions are understood as relative to a given argument or proof.\nIn the process of thinking through a proof, a given part of the\nthinking is replaceable if thinking of some other kind could\nstand in place of the given part in a process that would count as\nthinking through the same proof. A given part of the thinking is\nsuperfluous if its excision without replacement would be a\nprocess of thinking through the same proof. Superfluous thinking may\nbe extremely valuable in facilitating grasp of the proof text and in\nenabling one to understand the idea underlying the proof steps; but it\nis not necessary for thinking through the proof. \nIt is uncontentious that the visual thinking involved in symbol\nmanipulations, for example in following the \u201calgebraic\u201d\nsteps of proofs of basic lemmas about groups, can be essential, that\nis neither superfluous nor replaceable. The worry is about thinking\nvisually with diagrams, where \u201cdiagram\u201d is used widely to\ninclude all non-symbolic visual representations. Let us agree that\nthere can be superfluous diagrammatic thinking in thinking through a\nproof. This leaves several possibilities.\n\n(a) All diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking through a proof is superfluous.\n(b)Not all diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking through a proof is superfluous; but if not superfluous it will be replaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking. \n(c)Some diagrammatic thinking in a process of thinking through a proof is neither superfluous nor replaceable by non-diagrammatic thinking. \n\n",
