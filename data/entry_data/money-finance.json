    "preamble": "\n\nFinance and philosophy may seem to be worlds apart. But they share at\nleast one common ancestor: Thales of Miletus. Thales is typically\nregarded as the first philosopher, but he was also a financial\ninnovator. He appears to have been what we would now call an option\ntrader. He predicted that next year\u2019s olive harvest would be\ngood, and therefore paid a small amount of money to the owners of\nolive presses for the right to the next year\u2019s use. When the\nharvest turned out to be as good as predicted, Thales earned a sizable\namount of money by renting out the presses (Aristotle,\nPolitics, 1259a).\n\nObviously, a lot has changed since Thales\u2019 times, both in\nfinance and in our ethical and political attitudes towards finance.\nCoins have largely been replaced by either paper or electronic money,\nand we have built a large infrastructure to facilitate transactions of\nmoney and other financial assets\u2014with elements including\ncommercial banks, central banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges,\nand investment funds. This institutional multiplicity is due to\nconcerted efforts of both private and public agents, as well as\ninnovations in financial economics and in the financial industry\n(Shiller 2012).\n\nOur ethical and political sensitivities have also changed in several\nrespects. It seems fair to say that most traditional ethicists held a\nvery negative attitude towards financial activities. Think, for\nexample, of Jesus\u2019 cleansing of the temple from moneylenders,\nand the widespread condemnation of money as \u201cthe root of all\nevil\u201d. Attitudes in this regard seem to have softened over time.\nHowever, the moral debate continues to recur, especially in connection\nwith large scandals and crises within finance, the largest such crisis\nin recent memory of course being the global financial crisis of\n2008.\n\nThis article describes what philosophical analysis can say about money\nand finance. It is divided into five parts that respectively concern\n(1) what money and finance really are (metaphysics), (2) how knowledge\nabout financial matters is or should be formed (epistemology), (3) the\nmerits and challenges of financial economics (philosophy of science),\n(4) the many ethical issues related to money and finance (ethics), and\n(5) the relationship between finance and politics (political\nphilosophy).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Metaphysics\n1.1 What is Money?\n\nMoney is so ever-present in modern life that we tend to take its\nexistence and nature for granted. But do we know what money actually\nis? Two competing theories present fundamentally different ontologies\nof money.\n\nThe commodity theory of money: A classic theory,\nwhich goes back all the way to Aristotle (Politics,\n1255b\u20131256b), holds that money is a kind of commodity that\nfulfills three functions: it serves as (i) a medium of exchange, (ii)\na unit of account, and (iii) a store of value. Imagine a society that\nlacks money, and in which people have to barter goods with each other.\nBarter only works when there is a double coincidence of\nwants; that is, when A wants what B has and\nB wants what A has. But since such coincidences are\nlikely to be uncommon, a barter economy seems both cumbersome and\ninefficient (Smith 1776, Menger 1892). At some point, people will\nrealize that they can trade more easily if they use some intermediate\ngood\u2014money. This intermediate good should ideally be easy to\nhandle, store and transport (function i). It should be easy to measure\nand divide to facilitate calculations (function ii). And it should be\ndifficult to destroy so that it lasts over time (function iii).\n\nMonetary history may be viewed as a process of improvement with regard\nto these functions of money (Ferguson 2008, Weatherford 1997). For\nexample, some early societies used certain basic necessities as money,\nsuch as cattle or grain. Other societies settled on commodities that\nwere easier to handle and to tally but with more indirect value, such\nas clamshells and precious metals. The archetypical form of money\nthroughout history are gold or silver coins\u2014therefore the\ncommodity theory is sometimes called metallism (Knapp 1924,\nSchumpeter 1954). Coinage is an improvement on bullion in that both\nquantity and purity are guaranteed by some third party, typically the\ngovernment. Finally, paper money can be viewed as a simplification of\nthe trade in coins. For example, a bank note issued by the Bank of\nEngland in the 1700s was a promise to pay the bearer a certain pound\nweight of sterling silver (hence the origin of the name of the British\ncurrency as \u201cpounds sterling\u201d).\n\nThe commodity theory of money was defended by many classical\neconomists and can still be found in most economics textbooks (Mankiw\n2009, Parkin 2011). This latter fact is curious since it has provoked\nserious and sustained critique. An obvious flaw is that it has\ndifficulties in explaining inflation, the decreasing value of money\nover time (Innes 1913, Keynes 1936). It has also been challenged on\nthe grounds that it is historically inaccurate. For example, recent\nanthropological studies question the idea that early societies went\nfrom a barter economy to money; instead money seems to have arisen to\nkeep track of pre-existing credit relationships (Graeber 2011, Martin\n2013, Douglas 2016).\n\nThe credit theory of money: According to the main\nrival theory, coins and notes are merely tokens of something more\nabstract: money is a social construction rather than a physical\ncommodity. The abstract entity in question is a credit relationship;\nthat is, a promise from someone to grant (or repay) a favor (product\nor service) to the holder of the token (Macleod 1889, Innes 1914,\nIngham 2004). In order to function as money, two further features are\ncrucial: that (i) the promise is sufficiently credible, that is, the\nissuer is \u201ccreditworthy\u201d; and (ii) the credit is\ntransferable, that is, also others will accept it as payment for\ntrade.\n\nIt is commonly thought that the most creditworthy issuer of money is\nthe state. This thought provides an alternative explanation of the\npredominance of coins and notes whose value is guaranteed by states.\nBut note that this theory also can explain so-called fiat money, which\nis money that is underwritten by the state but not redeemable in any\ncommodity like gold or silver. Fiat money has been the dominant kind\nof money globally since 1971, when the United States terminated the\nconvertibility of dollars to gold. The view that only states can issue\nmoney is called chartalism, or the state theory of money\n(Knapp 1924). However, in order to properly understand the current\nmonetary system, it is important to distinguish between states\u2019\nissuing versus underwriting money. Most credit money\nin modern economies is actually issued by commercial banks through\ntheir lending operations, and the role of the state is only to\nguarantee the convertibility of bank deposits into cash (Pettifor\n2014).\n\nCriticisms of the credit theory tend to be normative and focus on the\nrisk of overexpansion of money, that is, that states (and banks) can\noveruse their \u201cprinting presses\u201d which may lead to\nunsustainable debt levels, excessive inflation, financial instability\nand economic crises. These are sometimes seen as arguments for a\nreturn to the gold standard (Rothbard 1983, Schlichter 2014). However,\nothers argue that the realization that money is socially constructed\nis the best starting point for developing a more sustainable and\nequitable monetary regime (Graeber 2010, Pettifor 2014). We will\nreturn to this political debate below\n (section 5.2).\n\nThe social ontology of money: But exactly how does\nthe \u201csocial construction\u201d of money work? This question\ninvokes the more general philosophical issue of social ontology, with\nregard to which money is often used as a prime example. In an early\nphilosophical-sociological account, Georg Simmel (1900) describes\nmoney as an institution that is a crucial precondition for modernity\nbecause it allows putting a value on things and simplifies\ntransactions; he also criticizes the way in which money thereby\nreplaces other forms of valuation (see also\n section 4.1).\n\nIn the more recent debate, one can distinguish between two main\nphilosophical camps. An influential account of social ontology holds\nthat money is the sort of social institution whose existence depends\non \u201ccollective intentionality\u201d: beliefs and attitudes that\nare shared in a community (Searle 1995, 2010). The process starts with\nsomeone\u2019s simple and unilateral declaration that something is\nmoney, which is a performative speech act. When other people recognize\nor accept the declaration it becomes a standing social rule. Thus,\nmoney is said to depend on our subjective attitudes but is not located\n(solely) in our minds (see also Lawson 2016, Brynjarsd\u00f3ttir\n2018, Passinsky 2020, Vooys & Dick 2021).\n\nAn alternative account holds that the creation of money need not be\nintentional or declarative in the above sense. Instead money comes\nabout as a solution to a social problem (the double coincidence of\nwants) \u2013 and it is maintained simply because it is functional or\nbeneficial to us (Guala 2016, Hindriks & Guala 2021). Thus what\nmakes something money is not the official declarations of some\nauthority, but rather that it works (functions) as money in a given\nsociety (see also Smit et al. 2011; 2016). (For more discussion see\nthe special issue by Hindriks & Sandberg 2020, as well as the\nentries on\n social ontology\n and\n social institutions).\n1.2 What is Finance?\n\nOne may view \u201cfinance\u201d more generally (that is, the\nfinancial sector or system) as an extension of the monetary system. It\nis typically said that the financial sector has two main functions:\n(1) to maintain an effective payments system; and (2) to facilitate an\nefficient use of money. The latter function can be broken down further\ninto two parts. First, to bring together those with excess money\n(savers, investors) and those without it (borrowers, enterprises),\nwhich is typically done through financial intermediation (the inner\nworkings of banks) or financial markets (such as stock or bond\nmarkets). Second, to create opportunities for market participants to\nbuy and sell money, which is typically done through the invention of\nfinancial products, or \u201cassets\u201d, with features\ndistinguished by different levels of risk, return, and maturation.\n\nThe modern financial system can thus be seen as an infrastructure\nbuilt to facilitate transactions of money and other financial assets,\nas noted at the outset. It is important to note that it contains both\nprivate elements (such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and\ninvestment funds) and public elements (such as central banks and\nregulatory authorities). \u201cFinance\u201d can also refer to the\nsystematic study of this system; most often to the field of financial\neconomics (see\n section 3).\n\nFinancial assets: Of interest from an ontological\nviewpoint is that modern finance consists of several other\n\u201casset types\u201d besides money; central examples include\ncredit arrangements (bank accounts, bonds), equity (shares or stocks),\nderivatives (futures, options, swaps, etc.) and funds (trusts). What\nare the defining characteristics of financial assets?\n\nThe typical distinction here is between financial and\n\u201creal\u201d assets, such as buildings and machines (Fabozzi\n2002), because financial assets are less tangible or concrete. Just\nlike money, they can be viewed as a social construction. Financial\nassets are often derived from or at least involve underlying\n\u201creal\u201d assets\u2014as, for example, in the relation\nbetween owning a house and investing in a housing company. However,\nfinancial transactions are different from ordinary market trades in\nthat the underlying assets seldom change hands, instead one exchanges\nabstract contracts or promises of future transactions. In this sense,\none may view the financial market as the \u201cmeta-level\u201d of\nthe economy, since it involves indirect trade or speculation on the\nsuccess of other parts of the economy.\n\nMore distinctly, financial assets are defined as promises of future\nmoney payments (Mishkin 2016, Pilbeam 2010). If the credit theory of\nmoney is correct, they can be regarded as meta-promises: promises on\npromises. The level of abstraction can sometimes become enormous: For\nexample, a \u201csynthetic collateralized debt obligation\u201d (or\n\u201csynthetic CDO\u201d), a form of derivative common before the\nfinancial crisis, is a promise from person A (the seller) to\nperson B (the buyer) that some persons C to\nI (speculators) will pay an amount of money depending on the\nlosses incurred by person J (the holder of an underlying\nderivative), which typically depend on certain portions (so-called\ntranches) of the cash flow from persons K to Q\n(mortgage borrowers) originally promised to persons R to\nX (mortgage lenders) but then sold to person Y (the\noriginator of the underlying derivative). The function of a synthetic\nCDO is mainly to spread financial risks more thinly between different\nspeculators.\n\nIntrinsic value: Perhaps the most important\ncharacteristic of financial assets is that their price can\nvary enormously with the attitudes of investors. Put simply, there are\ntwo main factors that determine the price of a financial asset: (i)\nthe credibility or strength of the underlying promise (which will\ndepend on the future cash flows generated by the asset); and (ii) its\ntransferability or popularity within the market, that is, how many\nother investors are interested in buying the asset. In the process\nknown as \u201cprice discovery\u201d, investors assess these factors\nbased on the information available to them, and then make bids to buy\nor sell the asset, which in turn sets its price on the market (Mishkin\n2016, Pilbeam 2010).\n\nA philosophically interesting question is whether there is such a\nthing as an \u201cintrinsic\u201d value of financial assets, as is\noften assumed in discussions about financial crises. For example, a\ncommon definition of an \u201casset bubble\u201d is that this is a\nsituation that occurs when certain assets trade at a price that\nstrongly exceed their intrinsic value\u2014which is dangerous since\nthe bubble can burst and cause an economic shock (Kindleberger 1978,\nMinsky 1986, Reinhart & Rogoff 2009). But what is the intrinsic\nvalue of an asset? The rational answer seems to be that this depends\nonly on the discounted value of the underlying future cash\nflow\u2014in other words, on (i) and not (ii) above. However, someone\nstill has to assess these factors to compute a price, and this\nassessment inevitably includes subjective elements. As just noted, it\nis assumed that different investors have different valuations of\nfinancial assets, which is why they can engage in trades on the market\nin the first place.\n\nA further complication here is that (i) may actually be influenced by\n(ii). The fundamentals may be influenced by investors\u2019\nperceptions of them, which is a phenomenon known as\n\u201creflexivity\u201d (Soros 1987, 2008). For example, a company\nwhose shares are popular among investors will often find it easier to\nborrow more money and thereby to expand its cash flow, in turn making\nit even more popular among investors. Conversely, when the\ncompany\u2019s profits start to fall it may lose popularity among\ninvestors, thereby making its loans more expensive and its profits\neven lower. This phenomenon amplifies the risks posed by financial\nbubbles (Keynes 1936).\n2. Epistemology\n\nGiven the abstractness and complexity of financial assets and\nrelations, as outlined above, it is easy to see the epistemic\nchallenges they raise. For example, what is a proper basis for forming\njustified beliefs about matters of money and finance?\n\nA central concept here is that of risk. Since financial assets are\nessentially promises of future money payments, a main challenge for\nfinancial agents is to develop rational expectations or hypotheses\nabout relevant future outcomes. The two main factors in this regard\nare (1) expected return on the asset, which is typically calculated as\nthe value of all possible outcomes weighted by their probability of\noccurrence, and (2) financial risk, which is typically calculated as\nthe level of variation in these returns. The concept of financial risk\nis especially interesting from a philosophical viewpoint since it\nrepresents the financial industry\u2019s response to epistemic\nuncertainty. It is often argued that the financial system is designed\nexactly to address or minimize financial risks\u2014for example,\nfinancial intermediation and markets allow investors to spread their\nmoney over several assets with differing risk profiles (Pilbeam 2010,\nShiller 2012). However, many authors have been critical of mainstream\noperationalizations of risk which tend to focus exclusively on\nhistorical price volatility and thereby downplay the risk of\nlarge-scale financial crises (Lanchester 2010, Thamotheram & Ward\n2014).\n\nThis point leads us further to questions about the normativity of\nbelief and knowledge. Research on such topics as the ethics of belief\nand virtue epistemology considers questions about the responsibilities\nthat subjects have in epistemic matters. These include epistemic\nduties concerning the acquisition, storage, and transmission of\ninformation; the evaluation of evidence; and the revision or rejection\nof belief (see also\n ethics of belief).\n In line with a reappraisal of virtue theory in business ethics, it is\nin particular virtue epistemology that has attracted attention from\nscholars working on finance. For example, while most commentators have\nfocused on the moral failings that led to the financial crisis of\n2008, a growing literature examines epistemic failures.\n\nEpistemic failings in finance can be detected both at the level of\nindividuals and collectives (de Bruin 2015). Organizations may develop\ncorporate epistemic virtue along three dimensions: through matching\nepistemic virtues to particular functions (e.g., diversity at the\nboard level); through providing adequate organizational support for\nthe exercise of epistemic virtue (e.g., knowledge management\ntechniques); and by adopting organizational remedies against epistemic\nvice (e.g., rotation policies). Using this three-pronged approach\nhelps to interpret such epistemic failings as the failure of financial\ndue diligence to spot Bernard Madoff\u2019s notorious Ponzi scheme\n(uncovered in the midst of the financial crisis) (de Bruin 2014a,\n2015).\n\nEpistemic virtue is not only relevant for financial agents themselves,\nbut also for other institutions in the financial system. An important\nexample concerns accounting (auditing) firms. Accounting firms\ninvestigate businesses in order to make sure that their accounts\n(annual reports) offer an accurate reflection of the financial\nsituation. While the primary intended beneficiaries of these auditing\nservices are shareholders (and the public at large), accountants are\npaid by the firms they audit. This remuneration system is often said\nto lead to conflicts of interest. While accounting ethics is primarily\nconcerned with codes of ethics and other management tools to minimize\nthese conflicts of interests, an epistemological perspective may help\nto show that the business-auditor relationship should be seen as\ninvolving a joint epistemic agent in which the business provides\nevidence, and the auditor epistemic justification (de Bruin 2013). We\nwill return to issues concerning conflicts of interest below (in\n section 4.2).\n\nEpistemic virtue is also important for an effective governance or\nregulation of financial activities. For example, a salient epistemic\nfailing that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis seems to be the\nway that Credit Rating Agencies rated mortgage-backed securities and\nother structured finance instruments, and with related failures of\nfinancial due diligence, and faulty risk management (Warenski 2008).\nCredit Rating Agencies provide estimates of credit risk of bonds that\ninstitutional investors are legally bound to use in their investment\ndecisions. This may, however, effectively amount to an institutional\nsetup in which investors are forced by law partly to outsource their\nrisk management, which fails to foster epistemic virtue (Booth &\nde Bruin 2021, de Bruin 2017). Beyond this, epistemic failures can\nalso occur among regulators themselves, as well as among relevant\npolicy makers (see further in\n section 5.1).\n\nA related line of work attests to the relevance of epistemic injustice\nto finance. Taking Fricker\u2019s (2009) work as a point of\ndeparture, de Bruin (2021) examines testimonial injustice in financial\nservices, whereas Mussell (2021) focuses on the harms and wrongs of\ntestimonial injustice as they occur in the relationship between\ntrustees and fiduciaries.\n3. Philosophy of Science\n\nCompared to financial practitioners, one could think that financial\neconomists should be at an epistemic advantage in matters of money and\nfinance. Financial economics is a fairly young but well established\ndiscipline in the social sciences that seeks to understand, explain,\nand predict activities within financial markets. However, a few months\nafter the crash in 2008, Queen Elizabeth II famously asked a room full\nof financial economists in London why they had not predicted the\ncrisis (Egidi 2014). The Queen\u2019s question should be an excellent\nstarting point for an inquiry into the philosophy of science of\nfinancial economics. Yet only a few philosophers of science have\nconsidered finance specifically (Vergara Fern\u00e1ndez & de\nBruin\n 2021).[1]\n\nSome important topics in financial economics have received partial\nattention, including the Modigliani-Miller capital structure\nirrelevance theorem (Hindriks 2008), the efficient market hypothesis\n(Collier 2011), the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Weatherall\n2017), portfolio theory (Walsh 2015), financial equilibrium models\n(Farmer & Geanakoplos 2009), the concept of money (M\u00e4ki\n1997), and behavioral finance (Brav, Heaton, & Rosenberg 2004),\neven though most of the debate still occurs among economists\ninterested in methodology rather than among philosophers. A host of\ntopics remain to be investigated, however: the concept of Value at\nRisk (VaR) (and more broadly the concept of financial risk), the\ncapital asset pricing model (CAPM), the Gaussian copula, random walks,\nfinancial derivatives, event studies, forecasting (and big data),\nvolatility, animal spirits, cost of capital, the various financial\nratios, the concept of insolvency, and neurofinance, all stand in need\nof more sustained attention from philosophers.\n\nMost existing work on finance in philosophy of science is concerned\nwith models and modelling (see also\n models in science\n and\n philosophy of economics).\n It seems intuitive to view financial markets as extremely complex\nsystems: with so many different factors at play, predicting the price\nof securities (shares, bonds, etc.) seems almost impossible. Yet\nmainstream financial economics is firmly committed to the idea that\nmarket behavior should be understood as ultimately resulting from\ninteractions of agents maximizing their expected utility. This is a\ndirect application of the so-called neoclassical school of economics\nthat was developed during the late nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies. While this school continues to dominate textbooks in the\nfield, there is a growing scholarly trend that seeks to criticize,\ncomplement or even replace some of its main assumptions. We can see\nhow the problems play out in both corporate finance and asset pricing\ntheory.\n\nCorporate finance concerns the financing of firms. One question\nconcerns a firm\u2019s capital structure: should a firm obtain\nfunding through equity (that is, from shareholders expecting\ndividends) or through debt (that is, from bondholders who lend money\nto the firm and have a contractual right to receive interest on the\nloans), or through a combination of the two. A key result in corporate\nfinance is the Modigliani-Miller theorem, which says that a\nfirm\u2019s capital structure is irrelevant to its market value\n(Modigliani & Miller 1958). This theorem makes a number of highly\nunrealistic assumptions, among them the assumption that markets are\nefficient, and that there are no taxes. Alongside many other results\nin economics, it may therefore be considered as useless for predictive\npurposes; or even as dangerous, once used for such purposes\nnonetheless (Egidi 2014). In a detailed study of the Modigliani-Miller\ntheorem, Hindriks (2008) has argued, however, that the value of highly\nidealized models in economics may lie in their providing\ncounterfactual insights, just as in physics. Galileo\u2019s law of\nfree fall tells us what happens in a vacuum. Despite the fact that\nvacuum is rare in reality, the law is not uninformative, because it\nallows us to associate observed phenomena to the extent to which an\nunrealistic assumption must be relaxed. Similarly, if one of the\nassumptions that the Modigliani-Miller theorem makes is the absence of\ntaxes, the observed relevance of capital structure may well have to be\nexplained as resulting from particular tax regimes. The explanation\nobtained by relaxing unrealistic assumptions is called\n\u201cexplanation by concretization\u201d (Hindriks 2008).\n\nExplanation by concretization works if models and reality share at\nleast a few concrete features. This is arguably the case for many\nextant models in finance, including models of bubbles and crises that\nare immediately relevant to explaining the 2008 crisis (Abreu &\nBrunnermeier 2003). A fairly recent development called\n\u201ceconophysics\u201d may, however, be an exception. Econophysics\nuses physics methods to model financial markets (see Rickles 2007 for\nan overview). Where traditional models of crises include individual\ninvestors with beliefs and desires modelled by probability\ndistributions and utility functions, econophysics models capture\ncrises the way physicists model transitions of matter from fluid to\nsolid state (Kuhlmann 2014).\n\nNext, consider asset pricing theory. Ever since Bachelier\u2019s\ngroundbreaking mathematical treatment of asset pricing, financial\neconomists have struggled to find the best way to determine the price\ndevelopments of securities such as shares, bonds, and derivative\ninstruments such as options. The mathematics of financial returns has\nreceived some attention in the literature (de Bruin & Walter 2017;\nIppoliti & Chen 2017). Most models assume that returns follow\nGaussian random walks, that is, stochastic processes in discrete time\nwith independent and identically distributed increments. Empirical\nstudies show, however, that returns are more peaked than Gaussian\ndistributions, and that they have \u201cfat tails\u201d. This means\nthat extreme events such as financial crises are far less improbable\nthan the models assume. An exception with regards to these assumptions\nis Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot\u2019s (1963) well-known contribution to\nfinancial mathematics, and work in this direction is gaining traction\nin mathematical finance.\n\nA third aspect of financial models concerns the way they incorporate\nuncertainty (Bertolotti & Magnani 2017). Some of the problems of\ncontemporary financial (and macroeconomic) models are due to the way\nthey model uncertainty as risk, as outlined above (Frydman &\nGoldberg 2013). Both neo-classical models and behavioral economics\ncapture uncertainty as probabilistic uncertainty, consequently\nignoring Knightian uncertainty (Knight 1921 see also\n decision theory).\n The philosophy of science literature that pertains to financial\neconomics is, however, still fairly small (Vergara Fern\u00e1ndez\n& de Bruin 2021).\n4. Ethics\n\nHaving considered the epistemic and scientific challenges of finance,\nwe now turn to the broad range of compelling ethical challenges\nrelated to money and finance. The present part is divided into three\nsections, discussing 1) the claim that financial activities are always\nmorally suspect, 2) various issues of fairness that can arise in\nfinancial markets, and 3) discussions about the social\nresponsibilities of financial agents.\n4.1 Money as the Root of All Evil?\n\nThroughout cultural history, activities that involve money or finance\nhave been subject to intense moral scrutiny and ethical debate. It\nseems fair to say that most traditional ethicists held a very negative\nattitude towards such activities. We will here discuss three very\nsweeping criticisms, respectively directed at the love of money (the\nprofit motive), usury (lending at interest), and speculation (gambling\nin finance).\n4.1.1 The love of money\n\nAt the heart of many sweeping criticisms of money and finance lies the\nquestion of motive. For instance, the full Biblical quotation says\nthat \u201cthe love of money is the root of all [kinds of]\nevil\u201d (1 Timothy 6:10). To have a \u201clove of money\u201d,\nor (in less moralistic words) a profit motive, means to seek money for\nits own sake. It has been the subject of much moral criticism\nthroughout history and continues to be controversial in popular\nmorality.\n\nThere are three main variations of the criticism. A first variation\nsays that there is something unnatural about the profit motive itself.\nFor example, Aristotle argued that we should treat objects in ways\nthat are befitting to their fundamental nature, and since money is not\nmeant to be a good in itself but only a medium of exchange (see\n section 1.1),\n he concluded that it is unnatural to desire money as an end in itself\n(Politics, 1252a\u20131260b). A similar thought is picked up\nby Marx, who argues that capitalism replaces the natural economic\ncycle of C\u2013M\u2013C (commodity exchanged for money exchanged\nfor commodity) with M\u2013C\u2013M (money exchanged for commodity\nexchanged for money). Thus the endless accumulation of money becomes\nthe sole goal of the capitalist, which Marx describes as a form of\n\u201cfetishism\u201d (Marx 1867, volume I).\n\nA second variation of the criticism concerns the character, or more\nprecisely the vice, that the profit motive is thought to exemplify\n(see also\n virtue ethics).\n To have a love for money is typically associated with selfishness and\ngreed, i.e., a desire to have as much as possible for oneself and/or\nmore than one really needs (McCarty 1988, Walsh & Lynch 2008).\nAnother association is the loss of moral scruples so that one is ready\nto do anything for money. The financial industry is often held out as\nthe worst in this regard, especially because of its high levels of\ncompensation. Allegations of greed soared after the 2008 crisis, when\nfinancial executives continued to receive million-dollar bonuses while\nmany ordinary workers lost their jobs (Piketty 2014, McCall 2010,\nAndersson & Sandberg 2019).\n\nA third variation of the criticism says that the profit motive signals\nthe absence of more appropriate motives. Kant argued that actions only\nhave moral worth if they are performed for moral reasons, or, more\nspecifically, for the sake of duty. Thus it is not enough that we do\nwhat is right, we must also do it because it is right (Kant\n1785). Another relevant Kantian principle is that we never should\ntreat others merely as means for our own ends, but always also as ends\nin themselves (see also\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy).\n Both of these principles seem to contrast with the profit motive\nwhich therefore is rendered morally problematic (Bowie 1999, Maitland\n2002). It should come as no surprise that Kant was a strong critic of\nseveral examples of \u201ccommodification\u201d and other market\nexcesses (see also\n markets).\n\nThere are two main lines of defensive argumentation. The most\ninfluential is Adam Smith\u2019s well-known argument about the\npositive side-effects of a self-interested pursuit of profits:\nalthough the baker and brewer only aim at their own respective good,\nSmith suggested, they are \u201cled by an invisible hand\u201d to at\nthe same time promote the public good (Smith 1776, see also Mandeville\n1732). This argument is typically viewed as a consequentialist\nvindication of the profit motive (see also\n consequentialism):\n positive societal effects can morally outweigh the possible\nshortcomings in individual virtue (Flew 1976).\n\nA second argument is more direct and holds that the profit motive can\nexemplify a positive virtue. For example, there is the well-known\nProtestant work ethic that emphasizes the positive nature of hard\nwork, discipline and frugality (Long 1972, Wesley 1771). The profit\nmotive can, on this view, be associated with virtues such as ambition,\nindustry, and discipline (see also Brennan 2021). According to Max\nWeber (1905), the Protestant work ethic played an important role in\nthe development of capitalism. But it is not clear whether any of\nthese arguments can justify an exclusive focus on profits, of\ncourse, or rather give permission to also focus on profits\nunder certain circumstances.\n4.1.2 Usury and interest\n\nIf having a love of money seems morally suspect, then the practice of\nmaking money on money\u2014for instance, lending money at\ninterest\u2014could seem even worse. This is another sweeping\ncriticism directed at finance that can be found among the traditional\nethicists. Societies in both Ancient and Medieval times typically\ncondemned or banned the practice of \u201cusury\u201d, which\noriginally meant all charging of interest on loans. As the practice\nstarted to become socially acceptable, usury came to mean the charging\nof excessive rates of interest. However, modern Islam still\ncontains a general prohibition against interest, and many countries\nstill have at least partial usury laws, most often setting an upper\nlimit on interest rates.\n\nWhat could be wrong with lending at interest? Some of the more obscure\narguments concern the nature of money (again): Aristotle argued that\nthere is something unnatural with \u201cmoney begetting money\u201d.\nWhile he allowed that money is a useful means for facilitating\ncommercial exchange, Aristotle thought that it has no productive use\nin itself and so receiving interest over and above the borrowed amount\nis unnatural and wrong (Politics, 1258b). A related argument\ncan be found in Aquinas, who argued that money is a good that is\nconsumed on use. Although a lender can legitimately demand repayment\nof an amount equivalent to the loan, it is illegitimate to demand\npayment for the use of the borrowed amount and so adding\ninterest is unnatural and wrong (Summa Theologica,\nII\u2013II, Q78).\n\nSome more promising arguments concern justice and inequality. For\nexample, as early as Plato we see the expression of the worry that\nallowing interest may lead to societal instability (The\nRepublic, II). It may be noted that the biblical condemnations of\nusury most straightforwardly prohibit interest-taking from the poor.\nOne idea here is that we have a duty of charity to the poor and\ncharging interest is incompatible with this duty. Another idea is that\nthe problem lies in the outcome of interest payments: Loans are\ntypically extended by someone who is richer (someone with capital) to\nsomeone who is poorer (someone without it) and so asking for\nadditional interest may increase the inequitable distribution of\nwealth (Sandberg 2012, Visser & MacIntosh 1998). A third idea,\nwhich is prominent in the protestant tradition, is that lending often\ninvolves opportunism or exploitation in the sense of offering bad\ndeals to poor people who have no other options (Graafland 2010).\n\nThe Islamic condemnation of interest, or riba, adds an\nadditional, third line of argument which holds that interest is\nessentially unearned or undeserved income: Since the lender neither\npartakes in the actual productive use of the money lent, nor exposes\nhim- or herself to commercial risk, the lender cannot legitimately\nshare in the gains produced by the loan (Ayub 2007, Birnie 1952,\nThomas 2006). Based on this argument, contemporary Islamic banks\ninsist that lenders and borrowers must form a business partnership in\norder for fees on loans to be morally legitimate (Ayub 2007, Warde\n2010). Economists have over the years given several retorts to this\nargument. Some economists stress that lending also involves risk\n(e.g., that the borrower defaults and is unable to repay); others\nstress the so-called opportunity costs of lending (i.e., that the\nmoney could have been used more profitably elsewhere); and yet again\nothers stress the simple time-preference of individuals (i.e., that we\nvalue present more than future consumption, and therefore the lender\ndeserves compensation for postponing consumption).\n\nThe gradual abandonment of the medieval usury laws in the West is\ntypically attributed to a growing acknowledgment of the great\npotential for economic growth unleashed by easy access to capital. One\ncould perhaps say that history itself disproved Aristotle: money\nindeed proved to have a productive use. In a short text from 1787,\nBentham famously poked fun at many of the classical anti-usury\narguments and defended the practice of charging interest from a\nutilitarian standpoint (Bentham 1787). However, this does not mean\nthat worries about the ethics of charging interest, and allegations of\nusury, have disappeared entirely in society. As noted above, usury\ntoday means charging interest rates that seem excessive or exorbitant.\nFor instance, many people are outraged by the rates charged on modern\npayday loans, or the way in which rich countries exact interest on\ntheir loans from poor countries (Baradaran 2015, Graeber 2011, Herzog\n2017a). These intuitions have clear affinities with the justice-based\narguments outlined above.\n4.1.3 Speculation and gambling\n\nA sweeping criticism of a more contemporary nature concerns the\nsupposed moral defects of speculation. This criticism tends to be\ndirected towards financial activities that go beyond mere lending.\nCritics of the capitalist system often liken the stock market to a\ncasino and investors to gamblers or punters (Sinn 2010, Strange 1986).\nMore moderate critics insist on a strict distinction between investors\nor shareholders, on the one hand, and speculators or gamblers, on the\nother (Bogle 2012, Sorell & Hendry 1994). In any case, the\nunderlying assumption is that the similarities between modern\nfinancial activities and gambling are morally troublesome.\n\nOn some interpretations, these concerns are similar to those raised\nabove. For example, some argue that speculators are driven by the\nprofit motive whereas investors have a genuine concern for the\nunderlying business enterprise (Hendry 2013). Others see speculation\nas \u201cparasitic\u201d, that is, to be without productive use, and\nsolely dependent on luck (Borna & Lowry 1987, Ryan 1902). This\nlatter argument is similar to the complaint about undeserved income\nraised in particular by Islamic scholars (Ayub 2007, Warde 2010).\n\nA more distinct interpretation holds that speculation typically\nincludes very high levels of risk-taking (Borna & Lowry 1987).\nThis is morally problematic when the risks not only affect the gambler\nhim or herself but also society as a whole. A root cause of the\nfinancial crisis of 2008 was widespread speculation on very risky\nderivatives such as \u201csynthetic collateralized debt\nobligations\u201d (see\n section 1.2).\n When the value of such derivatives fell dramatically, the financial\nsystem as a whole came to the brink of collapse. We will return to\nthis issue below (in\n section 4.3.1).\n In this regard, the question of risk imposition becomes important too\n(Moggia 2021).\n\nA related interpretation concerns the supposed short-sightedness of\nspeculation. It is often argued that financial agents and markets are\n\u201cmyopic\u201d in the sense that they care only about profits in\nthe very near term, e.g., the next quarter (Dallas 2012). Modern\ndisclosure requirements force companies to publish quarterly earnings\nreports. The myopia of finance is typically blamed for negative\neffects such as market volatility, the continuous occurrence of manias\nand crashes, inadequate investment in social welfare, and the general\nshortsightedness of the economy (e.g., Lacke 1996).\n\nDefenders of speculation argue that it can serve a number of positive\nends. To the extent that all financial activities are speculative in\nsome sense, of course, the ends coincide with the function of finance\nmore generally: to channel funds to the individuals or companies who\ncan use them in the most productive ways. But even speculation in the\nnarrower sense\u2014of high-risk, short-term bets\u2014can have a\npositive role to play: It can be used to \u201chedge\u201d or\noff-set the risks of more long-term investments, and it contributes to\nsustaining \u201cmarket liquidity\u201d (that is, as a means for\nproviding counterparties to trade with at any given point of time)\nwhich is important for an efficient pricing mechanism (Angel &\nMcCabe 2009, Koslowski 2009).\n4.2 Fairness in Financial Markets\n\nLet us now assume that the existence of financial markets is at least\nin general terms ethically acceptable, so that we can turn to discuss\nsome of the issues involved in making them fair and just for all\nparties involve. We will focus on three such issues: deception and\nfraud (honesty), conflicts of interest (care for customers), and\ninsider trading (fair play).\n4.2.1 Deception and fraud\n\nSome of the best-known ethical scandals in finance are cases of\ndeception or fraud. Enron, a huge US corporation, went bankrupt after\nit was discovered that its top managers had \u201ccooked the\nbooks\u201d, i.e., engaged in fraudulent accounting practices,\nkeeping huge debts off the company\u2019s balance sheet in an effort\nto make it look more profitable (McLean & Elkind 2003). Other\nscandals in the industry have involved deceptive marketing practices,\nhidden fees or costs, undisclosed or misrepresented financial risks,\nand outright Ponzi schemes (see\n section 2).\n\nWhile these examples seem obvious, on further examination it is not\neasy to give an exact definition of financial deception or fraud. The\nmost straightforward case seems to be deliberately misrepresenting or\nlying about financial facts. However, this assumes that there is such\na thing as a financial fact, i.e., a correct way of representing a\nfinancial value or transaction. In light of the socially constructed\nnature of money and finance (see\n section 1),\n this may not always be clear. Less straightforward cases include\nsimply concealing or omitting financial information, or refraining\nfrom obtaining the information in the first place.\n\nA philosophical conception of fraud, inspired by Kant, defines it as\ndenying to the weaker party in a financial transaction (such as a\nconsumer or investor) information that is necessary to make a rational\n(or autonomous) decision (Boatright 2014, Duska & Clarke 2002).\nMany countries require that the seller of a financial product (such a\ncompany issuing shares) must disclose all information that is\n\u201cmaterial\u201d to the product. It is an interesting question\nwhether this suggestion, especially the conception of rationality\ninvolved, should include or rule out a consideration of the ethical\nnature of the product (such as the ethical nature of the\ncompany\u2019s operations) (Lydenberg 2014). Furthermore, there may\nbe information that is legitimately excluded by other considerations,\nsuch as the privacy of individuals or companies commonly protected by\n\u201cbank secrecy\u201d laws.\n\nBut is access to adequate information enough? A complication here is\nthat the weaker party, especially ordinary consumers, may have trouble\nprocessing the information sufficiently well to identify cases of\nfraud. This is a structural problem in finance that has no easy fix,\nbecause financial products are often abstract, complex, and difficult\nto price. Therefore, full autonomy of agents may not only require\naccess to adequate information, but also access to sufficient know\nhow, processing ability and resources to analyze the information\n(Boatright 2014). One solution is to require that the financial\nservices industry promotes transparent communication in which they\ntrack the understanding of ordinary consumers (de Bruin 2014b,\nEnd\u00f6rfer & De Bruin 2019, Shiller 2012).\n4.2.2 Avoiding conflicts of interest\n\nDue to the problems just noted, the majority of ordinary consumers\nrefrain from engaging in financial markets on their own and instead\nrely on the services of financial intermediaries, such as banks,\ninvestment funds, and insurance companies. But this opens up new\nethical problems that are due to the conflicts of interest inherent in\nfinancial intermediation. Simply put, the managers or employees of\nintermediaries have ample opportunity, and often also incentives, to\nmisuse their customers\u2019 money and trust.\n\nAlthough it is once again difficult to give an exact definition, the\nliterature is full of examples of such misuse\u2014including\nso-called churning (trading excessively to generate high fees),\nstuffing (selling the bank\u2019s undesired assets to a client),\nfront-running (buying an asset for the bank first and then reselling\nit to the client at a higher price) and tailgating (mimicking a\nclient\u2019s trade to piggyback on his/her information) (Dilworth\n1994; Heacock, Hill, & Anderson 1987). Interestingly, some argue\nthat the whole industry of actively managed investment funds may be\nseen as a form of fraud. According to economic theory, namely, it is\nimpossible to beat the average returns of the market for any given\nlevel of financial risk, at least in the long term. Therefore, funds\nwho claim that they can do this for a fee are basically cheating their\nclients (cf. Hendry 2013, Kay 2015).\n\nA legal doctrine that aims to protect clients is so-called fiduciary\nduty, which imposes obligations on fiduciaries (those entrusted with\nothers\u2019 money) to act in the sole interest of beneficiaries\n(those who own the money). The interests referred to are typically\ntaken to be financial interests, so the obligation of the\nfiduciary is basically to maximize investment returns. But some argue\nthat there are cases in which beneficiaries\u2019 broader interests\nshould take precedence, such as when investing in fossil fuels may\ngive high financial returns but pose serious risks to people\u2019s\nfuture (Lydenberg 2014; Sandberg 2013, 2016). In any case, it is often\nthought that fiduciary duties go beyond the ideal of a free market to\ninstead give stronger protection to the weaker party of a fragile\nrelationship.\n\nAs an alternative or compliment to fiduciary duty, some argue for the\nadoption of a code of ethics or professional conduct by financial\nprofessionals. A code of ethics would be less arduous in legal terms\nand is therefore more attractive to free market proponents (Koslowski\n2009). It can also cover other fragile relationships (including those\nof bank-depositor, advisor-client, etc.). Just as doctors and lawyers\nhave a professional code, then, so finance professionals could have\none that stresses values such as honesty, due care and accuracy (de\nBruin 2016, Graafland & Ven 2011). But according to critics, the\nfinancial industry is simply too subdivided into different roles and\ncompetencies to have a uniform code of ethics (Ragatz & Duska\n2010). It is also unclear whether finance can be regarded as a\nprofession in the traditional sense, which typically requires a body\nof specialized knowledge, high degrees of organization and\nself-regulation, and a commitment to public service (Boatright 2014,\nHerzog 2019).\n4.2.3 Insider trading\n\nProbably the most well-known ethical problem concerning fairness in\nfinance, and also perhaps the one on which philosophers most disagree,\nis so-called insider trading. Put simply, this occurs when an agent\nuses his or her position within, or privileged information about, a\ncompany to buy or sell its shares (or other related financial assets)\nat favorable times and prices. For example, a CEO may buy shares in\nhis or her company just before it announces a major increase in\nearnings that will boost the share price. While there is no fraud or\nbreach of fiduciary duty, the agent seems to be exploiting an\nasymmetry of information.\n\nJust as in the cases above, it is difficult to give an exact\ndefinition of insider trading, and the scope of its operative\ndefinition tends to vary across jurisdictions. Most commentators agree\nthat it is the information and its attendant\ninformational asymmetry that counts and, thus, the\n\u201cinsider\u201d need not be inside the company at\nall\u2014those abusing access to information could be family, friends\nor other tippees (Irvine 1987a, Moore 1990). Indeed, some argue that\neven stock analysts or journalists can be regarded as insiders if they\ntrade on information that they have gathered themselves but not yet\nmade publicly available. It is also debatable whether an actual trade\nhas to take place or whether insider trading can consist in an\nomission to trade based on inside information, or also in enabling\nothers to trade or not trade (Koslowski 2009).\n\nSeveral philosophical perspectives have been used to explain what (if\nanything) is wrong with insider trading. A first perspective invokes\nthe concept of fair play. Even in a situation with fully autonomous\ntraders, the argument goes, market transactions are not fair if one\nparty has access to information that the other has not. Fair play\nrequires a \u201clevel playing field\u201d, i.e., that no\nparticipant starts from an unfairly advantaged position (Werhane 1989,\n1991). However, critics argue that this perspective imposes excessive\ndemands of informational equality. There are many asymmetries of\ninformation in the market that are seemingly unproblematic, e.g., that\nan antiquary knows more about antiques than his or her customers\n(Lawson 1988, Machan 1996). So might it be the\ninaccessibility of inside information that is problematic?\nBut against this, one could argue that, in principle, outsiders have\nthe possibility to become insiders and thus to obtain the exact same\ninformation (Lawson 1988, Moore 1990).\n\nA second perspective views insider trading as a breach of duty, not\ntowards the counterparty in the trade but towards the source of the\ninformation. US legislation treats inside information as the property\nof the underlying company and, thus, insider trading is essentially a\nform of theft of corporate property (often called the misappropriation\ntheory) (Lawson 1988). A related suggestion is that it can be seen as\na violation of the fiduciary duty that insiders have towards the\ncompany for which they work (Moore 1990). However, critics argue that\nthe misappropriation theory misrepresents the relationship between\ncompanies and insiders. On the one hand, there are many normal\nbusiness situations in which insiders are permitted or even expected\nto spread inside information to outside sources (Boatright 2014). On\nthe other hand, if the information is the property of the company, why\ndo we not allow it to be \u201csold\u201d to insiders as a form of\nremuneration? (Engelen & van Liedekerke 2010, Manne 1966)\n\nA third perspective deals with the effects, both direct and indirect,\nof allowing insider trading. Interestingly, many argue that the direct\neffects of such a policy might be positive. As noted above, one of the\nmain purposes of financial markets is to form (or\n\u201cdiscover\u201d) prices that reflect all available information\nabout a company. Since insider trading contributes important\ninformation, it is likely to improve the process of price discovery\n(Manne 1966). Indeed, the same reasoning suggests that insider trading\nactually helps the counterparty in the trade to get a better price\n(since the insider\u2019s activity is likely to move the price in the\n\u201cright\u201d direction) so it is a victimless crime (Engelen\n& Liedekerke 2010). However, others express concern over the\nindirect effects, which are likely to be more negative. Allowing\ninsider trading may erode the moral standards of market participants\nby favoring opportunism over fair play (Werhane 1989). Moreover, many\npeople may be dissuaded from even participating in the market since\nthey feel that it is \u201crigged\u201d to their disadvantage\n(Strudler 2009).\n4.3 The Social Responsibility of Finance\n\nWe will now move on to take a societal view on finance, and discuss\nideas relating to the broader social responsibilities of financial\nagents, that go beyond their basic role as market participants. We\nwill discuss three such ideas here, respectively focusing on systemic\nrisk (a responsibility to avoid societal harm), microfinance (a\nresponsibility towards the poor or unbanked), and socially responsible\ninvestment (a responsibility to help address societal challenges).\n4.3.1 Systemic risk and financial crises\n\nOne root cause of the financial crisis of 2008 was the very high\nlevels of risk-taking of many banks and other financial agents. When\nthese risks materialized, the financial system came to the brink of\ncollapse. Many banks lost so much money that their normal lending\noperations were hampered, which in turn had negative effects on the\nreal economy, with the result that millions of \u201cordinary\u201d\npeople around the world lost their jobs. Many governments stepped in\nto bail out the banks and in consequence sacrificed other parts of\npublic spending. This is a prime example of how certain financial\nactivities, when run amok, can have devastating effects on third\nparties and society in general.\n\nMuch subsequent debate has focused on so-called systemic risk, that\nis, the risk of failures across several agents which impairs the\nfunctioning of the financial system as such (Brunnermeier & Oehmke\n2013, Smaga 2014). The concept of systemic risk gives rise to several\nprominent ethical issues. To what extent do financial agents have a\nmoral duty to limit their contributions to systemic risk? It could be\nargued that financial transactions always carry risk and that this is\n\u201cpart of the game\u201d. But the important point about systemic\nrisk is that financial crises have negative effects on third parties\n(so-called externalities). This constitutes a prima facie case for a\nduty of precaution on the part of financial agents, based on the\nsocial responsibility to avoid causing unnecessary harm (James 2017,\nLinarelli 2017). In cases where precaution is impossible, one could\nadd a related duty of rectification or compensation to the victims of\nthe harm (End\u00f6rfer 2022). It is, however, a matter of\nphilosophical dispute whether finance professionals can be held\nmorally responsible for these harms (de Bruin 2018, Moggia 2021).\n\nTwo factors determine how much an agent\u2019s activity contributes\nto systemic risk (Brunnermeier & Oehmke 2013, Smaga 2014). The\nfirst is financial risk of the agent\u2019s activity in the\ntraditional sense, i.e., the probability and size of the potential\nlosses for that particular agent. A duty of precaution may here be\ntaken to imply, e.g., stricter requirements on capital and liquidity\nreserves (roughly, the money that the agents must keep in their\ncoffers for emergency situations) (Admati & Hellwig 2013). The\nsecond factor is the agent\u2019s place in the financial system,\nwhich typically is measured by its interconnectedness with\u2014and\nthereby potential for cascading effects upon\u2014other agents. This\nfactor indicates that the duty of precaution is stronger for financial\nagents that are \u201csystemically important\u201d or, as the saying\ngoes, \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d institutions (Stiglitz 2009).\n\nAs an alternative to the reasoning above, one may argue that the duty\nof precaution is more properly located on the collective, i.e.,\npolitical level (James 2012, 2017). We return to this suggestion below\n(in\n section 5.1).\n4.3.2 Microfinance\n\nEven in normal times, people with very low income or wealth have\nhardly any access to basic financial services. Commercial banks have\nlittle to gain from offering such services to them; there is an\nelevated risk of loan losses (since the poor lack collateral) and it\nis costly to administer a large amount of very small loans\n(Armend\u00e1riz & Morduch 2010). Moreover, there will likely be\ncases where some bank officers discriminate against underprivileged\ngroups, even where extensive legal protection is in place. An\ninitiative that seeks to remedy these problems is\n\u201cmicrofinance\u201d, that is, the extension of financial\nservices, such as lending and saving, to poor people who are otherwise\n\u201cunbanked\u201d. The initiative started in some of the poorest\ncountries of the world, such as Bangladesh and India.\n\nThe justifications offered for microfinance are similar to the\njustifications offered for development aid. A popular justification\nholds that affluent people have a duty of assistance towards the poor,\nand microfinance is thought to be a particularly efficient way to\nalleviate poverty (Yunus 1998, 2007). But is this correct? Judging\nfrom the growing number of empirical \u201cimpact studies\u201d, it\nseems more correct to say that microfinance is sometimes\nhelpful, but at other times can be either ineffective or have negative\nside-effects (Hudon & Sandberg 2013, Roodman 2012). Another\njustification holds that there is a basic human right to subsistence,\nand that this includes a right to savings and credit (Hudon 2009,\nMeyer 2018). But critics argue that the framework of human rights is\nnot a good fit for financial services that come with both benefits and\nchallenges (Gershman & Morduch 2015, Sorell 2015).\n\nMicrofinance is of course different from development aid in that it\ninvolves commercial banking relations. This invites the familiar\npolitical debate of state- versus market-based support. Proponents of\nmicrofinance argue that traditional state-led development projects\nhave been too rigid and corrupt, whereas market-based initiatives are\nmore flexible and help people to help themselves\n(Armend\u00e1riz & Morduch 2010, Yunus 2007). According to\ncritics, however, it is the other way around: Markets will tend to\nbreed greed and inequality, whereas real development is created by\nlarge-scale investments in education and infrastructure (Bateman 2010,\nH. Weber 2004).\n\nIn recent years, the microfinance industry has witnessed several\n\u201cethical scandals\u201d that seemingly testify to the risk of\nmarket excesses. Reports have indicated that interest rates on\nmicroloans average at 20\u201330% per annum, and can sometimes be in\nexcess of 100%, which is much higher than the rates for non-poor\nborrowers. This raises questions about usury (Hudon & Ashta 2013;\nRosenberg, Gonzalez, & Narain 2009). However, some suggest a\ndefense of \u201csecond best\u201d, or last resort, when other\nsources of aid or cheaper credit are unavailable (Sandberg 2012).\nMicrofinance institutions have also been accused of using coercive\nlending techniques and forceful loan recovery practices (Dichter &\nHarper (eds) 2007; Priyadarshee & Ghalib 2012). This raises\nquestions about the ethical justifiability of commercial activity\ndirected at the desperately poor, because very poor customers may have\nno viable alternative to accepting deals that are both unfair and\nexploitative (Arnold & Valentin 2013, Hudon & Sandberg\n2013).\n4.3.3 Socially responsible investment\n\nSocially responsible investment refers to the emerging practice\nwhereby financial agents give weight to putatively ethical, social or\nenvironmental considerations in investment decisions\u2014e.g.,\ndecisions about what bonds or stocks to buy or sell, or how to engage\nwith the companies in one\u2019s portfolio. This is sometimes part of\na strictly profit-driven investment philosophy, based on the\nassumption that companies with superior social performance also have\nsuperior financial performance (Richardson & Cragg 2010). But more\ncommonly, it is perceived as an alternative to mainstream investment.\nThe background argument here is that market pricing mechanisms, and\nfinancial markets in particular, seem to be unable to promote\nsufficient levels of social and environmental responsibility in firms.\nEven though there is widespread social agreement on the evils of\nsweatshop labor and environmental degradation, for instance,\nmainstream investors are still financing enterprises that sustain such\nunjustifiable practices. Therefore, there is a need for a new kind of\ninvestor with a stronger sense of social responsibility (Sandberg\n2008, Cowton & Sandberg 2012).\n\nThe simplest and most common approach among these alternative\ninvestors is to avoid investments in companies that are perceived to\nbe ethically problematic. This is typically justified from a\ndeontological idea to the effect that it is wrong to invest in someone\nelse\u2019s wrongdoing (Irvine 1987b, Langtry 2002, Larmer 1997).\nThere are at least three interpretations of such moral\n\u201ctaint\u201d: (1) the view that it is wrong in itself to profit\nfrom others\u2019 wrongdoings, or to benefit from other\npeople\u2019s suffering; (2) the view that it is wrong to harm\nothers, or also to facilitate harm to other; or (3) the view that\nthere is a form of expressive or symbolic wrongdoing involved in\n\u201cmorally supporting\u201d or \u201caccepting\u201d wrongful\nactivities.\n\nThe deontological perspective above has been criticized for being too\nblack-and-white. On the one hand, it seems difficult to find any\ninvestment opportunity that is completely \u201cpure\u201d or devoid\nof possible moral taint (Kolers 2001). On the other hand, the\nrelationship between the investor and the investee is not as direct as\none may think. To the extent that investors buy and sell shares on the\nstock market, they are not engaging with the underlying companies but\nrather with other investors. The only way in which such transactions\ncould benefit the companies would be through movements in the share\nprice (which determines the companies\u2019 so-called cost of\ncapital), but it is extremely unlikely that a group of ethical\ninvestors can significantly affect that price. After all, the\nraison d\u2019\u00eatre of stock exchanges is exactly to\ncreate markets that are sufficiently liquid to maintain stable prices\n(Haigh & Hazelton 2004, Hudson 2005). In response to this, the\ndeontologist could appeal to some notion of universalizability or\ncollective responsibility: perhaps the right question to ask is not\n\u201cwhat happens if I do this?\u201d but instead\n\u201cwhat happens if we all do this?\u201d. However, such\nmore complicated philosophical positions have problems of their own\n(see also\n rule consequentialism\n and\n collective responsibility)\n\nA rival perspective on socially responsible investment is the (more\nstraightforward) consequentialist idea that investors\u2019 duty\ntowards society consists in using their financial powers to promote\npositive societal goods, such as social justice and environmental\nsustainability. This perspective is typically taken to prefer more\nprogressive investment practices, such as pushing management to adopt\nmore ambitious social policies and/or seeking out environmentally\nfriendly technology firms (Mackenzie 1997, Sandberg 2008). Of course,\nthe flip side of such practices, which may explain why they are less\ncommon in the market, is that they invite greater financial risks\n(Sandberg 2011). It remains an open question whether socially\nresponsible investment will grow enough in size to make financial\nmarkets a force for societal change.\n\nRecent work has started exploring whether concrete sustainable finance\npolicies (such as those suggested by the European Commission\u2019s\nSustainable Finance Action Plan) will generate sufficient funds to pay\nfor climate change mitigation and adaptation, based as they are on\npolicies of information provision only (De Bruin 2023).\n5. Political Philosophy\n\nDiscussions about the social responsibility of finance are obviously\npremised on the observation that the financial system forms a central\ninfrastructure of modern economies and societies. As we noted at the\noutset, it is important to see that the system contains both private\nelements (such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and\ninvestment funds) and public elements (such as central banks and\nregulatory bodies). However, issues concerning the proper balance\nbetween these elements, especially the proper role and reach of the\nstate, are perennially recurrent in both popular and philosophical\ndebates.\n\nThe financial system and the provision of money indeed raise a number\nof questions that connect it to the \u201cbig questions\u201d of\npolitical philosophy: including questions of democracy, justice, and\nlegitimacy, at both the national and global levels (on the history of\npolitical thinking about money see Eich 2019, 2020, 2022; Ingham 2004,\n2019; Martin 2013). The discussions around finance in political\nphilosophy can be grouped under three broad areas: financialization\nand democracy; finance, money and domestic justice; and finance and\nglobal justice. We consider these now in turn.\n5.1 Financialization and Democracy\n\nMany of the questions political philosophy raises about finance have\nto do with \u201cfinancialization\u201d. The phenomenon of\n\u201cfinancialization\u201d, whereby the economic system has become\ncharacterized by the increasing dominance of finance capital and by\nsystems of financial intermediation (Ert\u00fcrk et al. 2008; Davis\n2011; Engelen et al. 2011; Palley 2013), is of potentially substantial\nnormative significance in a number of regards. A related normative\nconcern is the potential growth in political power of the financial\nsector, which may be seen as a threat to democratic politics.\n\nThese worries are, in effect, an amplification of familiar concerns\nabout the \u201cstructural power\u201d or \u201cstructural\nconstraints\u201d of capital, whereby capitalist investors are able\nto reduce the freedom of action of democratic governments by\nthreatening \u201cinvestment strikes\u201d when their preferred\npolitical options are not pursued (see Lindblom 1977, 1982; Przeworski\n& Wallerstein 1988; Cohen 1989; B. Barry 2002; Christiano 2010,\n2012; Furendal & O\u2019Neill 2022). To take one recent version\nof these worries, Stuart White argues that a republican commitment to\npopular sovereignty is in significant tension with the acceptance of\nan economic system where important choices about investment, and hence\nthe direction of development of the economy, are under the control of\nfinancial interests (White 2011).\n\nIn many such debates, the fault-line seems to be the traditional one\nbetween those who favor social coordination by free markets, and hence\nstrict limitations on state activities, and those who favor democratic\npolitics, and hence strict limitations on markets (without denying\nthat there can be intermediate positions). But the current financial\nsystem is not a pure creature of the free market. In the\nfinancial system that we currently see, the principle that individuals\nare to be held financially accountable for their actions, and that\nthey will therefore be \u201cdisciplined\u201d by markets, is patchy\nat best. One major issue, discussed above, is the problem of banks\nthat are so large and interconnected that their failure would risk\ntaking down the whole financial system\u2014hence, they can\nanticipate that they will be bailed out by tax-payers\u2019 money,\nwhich creates a huge \u201cmoral hazard\u201d problem (e.g., Pistor\n2013, 2017). In addition, current legal systems find it difficult to\nimpose accountability for complex processes of divided labor, which is\nwhy there were very few legal remedies after the financial crisis of\n2008 (e.g., Reiff 2017).\n\nThe lack of accountability intensifies worries about the power\nrelations between democratic politicians and individuals or\ncorporations in the financial realm. One question is whether we can\neven apply our standard concept of democracy to societies that have\nthe kinds of financial systems we see today. We may ask whether\nsocieties that are highly financialized can ever be true democracies,\nor whether they are more likely to be \u201cpost-democracies\u201d\n(Crouch 2004). For example, states with high levels of sovereign debt\nwill need to consider the reaction of financial markets in every\nsignificant policy decision (see, e.g., Streeck 2013 [2014], see also\nKlein 2020) Moreover \u201crevolving doors\u201d between private\nfinancial institutions and supervising authorities impact on the\nability of public officials to hold financial agents accountable. This\nis similar to the problems of conflicts of interest raised above (see\nsections\n 2\n and\n 4.2.2).\n If financial contracts become a central, or maybe even the\nmost central, form of social relations (Lazzarato 2012), this may\ncreate an incompatibility with the equal standing of citizens,\nirrespective of financial position, that should be the basis of a\ndemocratic society and its public sphere of deliberation (see also\nBennett 2020 from an epistemic perspective).\n\nWhile finance has, over long stretches of history, been rather\nstrictly regulated, there has been a reversed trend towards\nderegulation since roughly the 1970s. After the financial crisis of\n2008, there have been many calls for reregulation. Proposals include\nhigher capital ratios in banks (Admati & Hellwig 2013), a return\nto the separation of commercial banking from speculative finance, as\nhad been the case, in the US, during the period when the\nGlass-Steagall Act was in place (Kay 2015), or a financial transaction\ntax (Wollner 2014). However, given that the financial system is a\nglobal system, one controversial question is whether regulatory steps\nby single countries would have any effect other than capital\nflight.\n5.2 Finance, Money, and Domestic Justice\n\nWhen it comes to domestic social justice, the central question\nrelating to the finance system concerns the ways in which the\nrealization of justice can be helped or hindered by how the financial\nsystem is organized.\n\nA first question here, already touched upon in the discussion about\nmicrofinance above\n (section 4.3.2),\n concerns the status of citizens as participants in financial markets.\nShould they all have a right to certain financial services such as a\nbank account or certain forms of loans, because credit should be seen\nas a primary good in capitalist economies (see, e.g., Hudon 2009,\nSorell 2015, Meyer 2018)? More broadly, how does the pattern of access\nto credit affect the distribution of freedom and unfreedom within\nsociety? (see Dietsch 2021; Preiss 2021). These are not only issues\nfor very poor countries, but also for richer countries with high\neconomic inequality, where it becomes a question of domestic justice.\nIn some countries all residents have the right to open a basic bank\naccount (see bank accounts in the EU in\n Other Internet Resources).\n For others this is not the case. It has been argued that not having\naccess to basic financial services creates an unfairness, because it\ndrives poorer individuals into a cash economy in which they are more\nvulnerable to exploitative lenders, and in which it is more difficult\nto build up savings (e.g., Baradaran 2015). Hence, it has been\nsuggested either to regulate banking services for individuals more\nstrictly (e.g., Herzog 2017a), to consider various forms of household\ndebt relief (Persad 2018), or to offer a public banking service, e.g.,\nrun by the postal office, which offers basic services at affordable\ncosts (Baradaran 2015).\n\nSecondly, financialization may also have more direct effects on\nsocio-economic inequality. Those with managerial positions within the\nfinancial sector are disproportionately represented among the very top\nend of the income distribution, and so the growth of inequality can in\npart be explained by the growth in the financial sector itself\n(Piketty 2014). There may also be an effect on social norms, whereby\nthe \u201chypermeritocratic\u201d norms of the financial sector have\nplayed a part in increasing social tolerance for inequality in society\nmore broadly (Piketty 2014: 265, 2020; see also O\u2019Neill 2017,\n2021). As Dietsch et al. point out, the process of increasing\nfinancialization within the economies of the advanced industrial\nsocieties has been encouraged by the actions of central banks over\nrecent decades, and so the issue of financialization also connects\nclosely to questions regarding the justice and legitimacy of central\nbanks and monetary policy (Dietsch, Claveau, & Fontan 2016, 2018;\nsee also Jacobs & King 2016).\n\nThirdly, many debates about the relation between distributive justice\nand the financial system revolve around the market for mortgages,\nbecause for many individuals, a house is the single largest item for\nwhich they need to take out a loan, and their mortgage their main\npoint of interaction with the financial system. This means that the\nquestion of who has access to mortgage loans and at what price can\nhave a major impact on the overall distribution of income and wealth.\nIn addition, it has an impact on how financial risks are distributed\nin society. Highly indebted individuals are more vulnerable when it\ncomes to ups and downs either in their personal lives (e.g., illness,\nloss of job, divorce) or in the economy as a whole (e.g., economic\nslumps) (Mian & Sufi 2014). The danger here is that existing\ninequalities\u2014which many theories of justice would describe as\nunjust\u2014are reinforced even further (Herzog 2017a).\n\nHere, however, a question about the institutional division of labor\narises: which goals of distributive justice should be achieved within\nmarkets\u2014and specifically, within financial markets\u2014and\nwhich ones by other means, for example through taxation and\nredistribution? The latter has been the standard approach used by many\nwelfare systems: the idea being to let markets run their course, and\nthen to achieve the desired patterns of distribution by taxation and\nredistribution. If one remains within that paradigm, questions arise\nabout whether the financial sector should be taxed more highly. In\ncontrast, the approach of \u201cpre-distribution\u201d (Hacker 2011;\nO\u2019Neill & Williamson 2012; O\u2019Neill 202), or what\nDietsch calls \u201cprocess redistribution\u201d (2010), is to\ndesign the rules of the economic game such that they contribute to\nbringing about the distributive pattern that is seen as just. This\ncould, for example, mean regulating banking services and credit\nmarkets in ways that reduce inequality, for example by imposing\nregulations on payday lenders and banks, so that poor individuals are\nprotected from falling into a spiral of ever higher debt. A more\nradical view could be to see the financial problems faced by such\nindividuals as being caused by more general structural injustices the\nsolution of which does not necessarily require interventions with the\nfinancial industry, but rather more general redistributive (or\npredistributive) policies.\n\nMoney creation: Another alternative theoretical\napproach is to integrate distributive concerns into monetary\npolicy, i.e., when it comes to the creation of money. So far, central\nbanks have focused on the stability of currencies and, in some cases,\nlevels of employment. This technical focus, together with the risk\nthat politicians might abuse monetary policy to try to boost the\neconomy before elections, have been used in arguments for putting the\ncontrol of the money supply into the hands of technical experts,\nremoving monetary policy from democratic politics. But after the\nfinancial crisis of 2008, many central banks have used unconventional\nmeasures, such as \u201cquantitative easing\u201d, which had\nstrongly regressive effects, favoring the owners of stocks or of\nlanded property (Fontan et al. 2016, Dietsch 2017); they did not take\ninto account other societal goals, e.g., the financing of green\nenergy, either. This raises new questions of justice: are such\nmeasures justified if their declared aim is to move the economy out of\na slump, which presumably also helps disadvantaged individuals\n(Haldane 2014)? Would other measures, for instance \u201chelicopter\nmoney\u201d that is distributed to all citizens, have been a better\nalternative? And if such measures are used, is it still appropriate to\nthink of central banks as institutions in which nothing but technical\nexpertise is required, or should there be some form of accountability\nto society? (Fontan, Claveau, & Dietsch 2016; Dietsch 2017; Riles\n2018; see also Tucker 2018; van \u2019t Klooster 2020; James &\nHockett 2020, Downey\n 2021).[2]\n\nWe have already discussed the general issue of the ontological status\nof money\n (section 1.1\n above). But there are also significant questions in political\nphilosophy regarding the question of where, and by what sorts of\ninstitutions, should the money supply be controlled. One complicating\nfactor here is the extensive disagreement about the institutional\nbasis of money creation, as described above. One strand of the credit\ntheory of money emphasizes that in today\u2019s world, money creation\nis a process in which commercial banks play a significant role. These\nbanks in effect create new money when they make new loans to\nindividual or business customers (see McLeay, Radia, & Thomas\n2014; see also Palley 1996; Ryan-Collins et al. 2012; Werner 2014a,b).\nJames Tobin refers to commercial bank-created money, in an evocative\nif now dated image as \u201cfountain pen money\u201d, that is, money\ncreated with the swish of the bank manager\u2019s fountain pen (Tobin\n1963).\n\nHowever, the relationship between private commercial banks and the\ncentral bank is a complicated one, such that we might best think of\nmoney creation as a matter involving a kind of hybrid public-private\npartnership. Hockett and Omarova refer to this relationship as\nconstituting a \u201cfinance franchise\u201d, with private banks\nbeing granted on a \u201cfranchise\u201d basis the money-creating\npowers of the sovereign monetary authority, while van \u2019t\nKlooster describes this relation between the public and private as\nconstituting a \u201chybrid monetary constitution\u201d (Hockett\n& Omarova 2017; van \u2019t Klooster 2017; see also Bell 2001).\nIn this hybrid public-private monetary system, it is true that private\ncommercial banks create money, but they nevertheless do so in a way\nthat involves being regulated and subject to the authority of the\ncentral bank within each monetary jurisdiction, with that central bank\nalso acting as \u201clender of last resort\u201d (Bagehot 1873) when\ninter-bank lending dries\n up.[3]\n\nWhen the curious public-private nature of money creation is brought\ninto focus, it is not surprising that there should exist views\nadvocating a shift away from this hybrid monetary constitution, either\nin the direction of a fully public option, or a fully private system\nof money creation.\n\nAdvocates of fully public banking envisage a system in which private\nbanks are stripped of their authority to create new money, and where\ninstead the money supply is directly controlled either by the\ngovernment or by some other state agency; for example by the central\nbank lending directly to firms and households. Such a position can be\ndefended on a number of normative grounds: that a public option would\nallow for greater financial stability, that a fully public system of\nmoney creation would allow a smoother transmission of democratic\ndecisions regarding economic governance; or simply because of the\nconsequences of such a system with regards to socioeconomic inequality\nand environmental sustainability (see Jackson & Dyson 2012; Wolf\n2014a,b; Lain\u00e0 2015; Dyson, Hodgson, & van Lerven 2016a,b;\nIngham, Coutts, & Konzelmann 2016; Dow 2016; Wodruff 2019;\nvan\u2019t Klooster 2019, Mellor 2019, Dietsch 2021; for commentary\nand criticism see Goodhart & Jensen 2015; Fontana & Sawyer\n2016, Larue et al. 2020).\n\nIn stark contrast, a number of libertarian authors have defended the\nview that the central bank should have no role in money creation, with\nthe money supply being entirely a matter for private suppliers (and\nwith the consumers of money able to choose between different rival\nsuppliers), under a system of \u201cfree banking\u201d (e.g., Simons\n1936; Friedman 1962; von Hayek 1978; Selgin 1988). Advocacy of private\nmoney creation has received a more recent stimulus with the rise of\nBitcoin and other crypto-currencies, with some of Bitcoin\u2019s\nadvocates drawing on similar libertarian arguments to those offered by\nHayek and Selgin (see Golumbia 2016, Robison 2022). One can also\nmention the \u201calternative currencies\u201d movement here which\ndefends private money creation on entirely different grounds, most\noften by appeal to the value of community (see Larue 2022, Larue et\nal. 2022).\n5.3 Finance and Global Justice\n\nFinally, a number of issues relate questions about finance to\nquestions about global justice. The debate about global justice (see\nalso\n global justice)\n has weighed the pros and cons of \u201cstatist\u201d and\n\u201ccosmopolitan\u201d approaches, that is, approaches to justice\nthat would focus on the nation state (maybe with some additional\nduties of beneficence to the globally poor) or on the global scale.\nThe financial system is one of the most globalized systems of social\ninteraction that currently exist, and global entanglements are hard to\ndeny (e.g., Valentini 2011: 195\u20138). The question thus is whether\nthis creates duties of justice on the financial system, and if so,\nwhether it fulfills these duties, i.e., whether it contributes to\nmaking the world more globally just, or whether it tends in the\nopposite direction (or whether it is neutral).\n\nThere are a number of institutions, especially the World Bank and the\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), that constitute a rudimentary\nglobal order of finance. Arguably, many countries, especially poorer\nones, cannot reasonably opt out of the rules established by these\ninstitutions (e.g., Hassoun 2012, Krishnamurthy 2014). It might\ntherefore appear to be required by justice that these institutions be\ngoverned in a way that represents the interests of all countries. But\nbecause of historical path-dependencies, and because a large part of\ntheir budget comes from Western countries, the governance structures\nare strongly biased in their favor (for example, the US can veto all\nimportant decisions in the IMF). Miller (2010: 134\u201341) has\ndescribed this situation as \u201cindirect financial rule\u201d by\nthe US (see also Herzog 2021).\n\nAn issue worth noting in this context is the fact that the US dollar,\nand to a lesser degree the Euro, function as de facto global\ncurrencies, with a large part of global trade being conducted in these\ncurrencies (e.g., Mehrling 2011, Eichengreen 2011). This allows the\nissuing countries to run a current account deficit, which amounts to a\nredistribution from poorer to richer countries for which compensation\nmight be owed (Reddy 2005: 224\u20135). This fact also raises\nquestions about the distribution of power in the global sphere, which\nhas often been criticized as favoring Western countries (e.g., Gulati\n1980, United Nations 2009). However, global financial markets serve\nnot only to finance trade in goods and services; there are also\nquestions about fluctuations in these markets that result exclusively\nfrom speculations (see also sect.1.4.3 above). Such fluctuations can\ndisproportionately harm poorer countries, which are more vulnerable to\nmovements of capital or rapid changes in commodity prices. Hence, an\nold proposal that has recently been revived and defended from a\nperspective of global justice is that of a \u201cTobin tax\u201d\n(Tobin 1978), which would tax financial transactions and thereby\nreduce volatility in international financial markets (Reddy 2005,\nWollner 2014).\n\nA second feature of the current global order that has been criticized\nfrom a perspective of justice is the \u201cborrowing\nprivilege\u201d. As Pogge describes (e.g., 2008: chap. 4), the\ngovernments of countries can borrow on international financial\nmarkets, no matter whether they have democratic legitimacy or not.\nThis means that rogue governments can finance themselves by incurring\ndebts that future generations of citizens will have to repay.\n\nSovereign debt raises a number of questions that are related to global\njustice. Usually, the contracts on which they are based are considered\nas absolutely binding (e.g., Suttle 2016), which can threaten national\nsovereignty (Dietsch 2011), and raises questions of the moral and\npolitical responsibilities both of citizens of debtor nations, and of\ncreditor countries themselves (Wiedenbr\u00fcg, 2018a, 2018b). These\nproblems obtain in particular with regard to what has been called\n\u201codious\u201d debt (Sack 1927, Howse 2007, Dimitriu 2015, King\n2016): cases in which government officials sign debt contracts in\norder to enrich themselves, with lenders being aware of this fact.\nSuch cases have been at the center of calls for a jubilee for indebted\nnations. At the moment, there are no binding international rules for\nhow to deal with sovereign bankruptcy, and countries in financial\ndistress have no systematic possibility of making their claims heard,\nwhich is problematic from a perspective of justice (e.g., Palley 2003;\nReddy 2005: 26\u201333; Herman 2007; C. Barry & Tomitova 2007;\nWollner 2018). The IMF, which often supports countries in\nrestructuring sovereign debt, has often made this support conditional\nupon certain requirements about rearranging the economic structures of\na country (for a discussion of the permissibility of such practices\nsee C. Barry 2011).\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the issue of financial\nregulation has a global dimension in the sense that capital is mobile\nacross national boundaries, creating the threats to democracy\ndescribed above. This fact makes it difficult for individual\ncountries, especially smaller ones, to install the more rigid\nfinancial regulations that would be required from a perspective of\njustice. Just as with many other questions of global justice (see,\ne.g., Dietsch 2015 on taxation), we seem to see a failure of\ncoordination between countries, which leads to a \u201crace to the\nbottom\u201d. Making global financial institutions more just is\ntherefore likely to require significant levels of international\ncooperation.\n",
