    "main_text": "Critical Social Theory\n3. Critical Social Theory\n\nDialectic of Enlightenment presupposes a critical social\ntheory indebted to Karl Marx. Adorno reads Marx as a Hegelian\nmaterialist whose critique of capitalism unavoidably includes a\ncritique of the ideologies that capitalism sustains and requires. The\nmost important of these is what Marx called \u201cthe fetishism of\ncommodities.\u201d Marx aimed his critique of commodity fetishism against\nbourgeois social scientists who simply describe the capitalist economy\nbut, in so doing, simultaneously misdescribe it and prescribe a false\nsocial vision. According to Marx, bourgeois economists necessarily\nignore the exploitation intrinsic to capitalist production. They fail\nto understand that capitalist production, for all its surface \u201cfreedom\u201d\nand \u201cfairness,\u201d must extract surplus value from the labor of the\nworking class. Like ordinary producers and consumers under capitalist\nconditions, bourgeois economists treat the commodity as a fetish. They\ntreat it as if it were a neutral object, with a life of its own, that\ndirectly relates to other commodities, in independence from the human\ninteractions that actually sustain all commodities. Marx, by contrast,\nargues that whatever makes a product a commodity goes back to human\nneeds, desires, and practices. The commodity would not have \u201cuse value\u201d\nif it did not satisfy human wants. It would not have \u201cexchange value\u201d\nif no one wished to exchange it for something else. And its exchange\nvalue could not be calculated if the commodity did not share with other\ncommodities a \u201cvalue\u201d created by the expenditure of human labor power\nand measured by the average labor time socially necessary to produce\ncommodities of various sorts. \n\n\nAdorno's social theory attempts to make Marx's central insights\napplicable to \u201clate capitalism.\u201d Although in agreement with Marx's\nanalysis of the commodity, Adorno thinks his critique of commodity\nfetishism does not go far enough. Significant changes have occurred in\nthe structure of capitalism since Marx's day. This requires revisions\non a number of topics: the dialectic between forces of production and\nrelations of production; the relationship between state and economy;\nthe sociology of classes and class consciousness; the nature and\nfunction of ideology; and the role of expert cultures, such as modern\nart and social theory, in criticizing capitalism and calling for the\ntransformation of society as a whole.\n\n\nThe primary clues to these revisions come from a theory of\nreification proposed by the Hungarian socialist Georg Luk\u00e1cs in\nthe 1920s and from interdisciplinary projects and debates conducted by\nmembers of the Institute of Social Research in the 1930s and 1940s.\nBuilding on Max Weber's theory of rationalization, Luk\u00e1cs argues\nthat the capitalist economy is no longer one sector of society\nalongside others. Rather, commodity exchange has become the central\norganizing principle for all sectors of society. This allows commodity\nfetishism to permeate all social institutions (e.g., law,\nadministration, journalism) as well as all academic disciplines,\nincluding philosophy. \u201cReification\u201d refers to \u201cthe structural process\nwhereby the commodity form permeates life in capitalist society.\u201d\nLuk\u00e1cs was especially concerned with how reification makes human\nbeings \u201cseem like mere things obeying the inexorable laws of the\nmarketplace\u201d (Zuidervaart 1991, 76).\n\n\nInitially Adorno shared this concern, even though he never had\nLuk\u00e1cs's confidence that the revolutionary working class could\novercome reification. Later Adorno called the reification of\nconsciousness an \u201cepiphenomenon.\u201d What a critical social theory really\nneeds to address is why hunger, poverty, and other forms of human\nsuffering persist despite the technological and scientific potential to\nmitigate them or to eliminate them altogether. The root cause, Adorno says,\nlies in how capitalist relations of production have come to dominate\nsociety as a whole, leading to extreme, albeit often invisible,\nconcentrations of wealth and power (ND 189\u201392). Society has come to be\norganized around the production of exchange values for the sake of\nproducing exchange values, which, of course, always already requires a\nsilent appropriation of surplus value. Adorno refers to this nexus of\nproduction and power as the \u201cprinciple of exchange\u201d\n(Tauschprinzip). A society where this nexus prevails is an\n\u201cexchange society\u201d (Tauschgesellschaft).\n\n\nAdorno's diagnosis of the exchange society has three levels:\npolitico-economic, social-psychological, and cultural. Politically and\neconomically he responds to a theory of state capitalism proposed by\nFriedrich Pollock during the war years. An economist by training who\nwas supposed to contribute a chapter to Dialectic of\nEnlightenment but never did (Wiggershaus 1994, 313\u201319), Pollock\nargued that the state had acquired dominant economic power in Nazi\nGermany, the Soviet Union, and New Deal America. He called this new\nconstellation of politics and economics \u201cstate capitalism.\u201d While\nacknowledging with Pollock that political and economic power have\nbecome more tightly meshed, Adorno does not think this fact changes the\nfundamentally economic character of capitalist exploitation. Rather,\nsuch exploitation has become even more abstract than it was in Marx's\nday, and therefore all the more effective and pervasive.\n\n\nThe social-psychological level in Adorno's diagnosis serves to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and pervasiveness of late capitalist\nexploitation. His American studies of anti-Semitism and the\n\u201cauthoritarian personality\u201d argue that these pathologically extend \u201cthe\nlogic of late capitalism itself, with its associated dialectic of\nenlightenment.\u201d People who embrace anti-Semitism and fascism tend to\nproject their fear of abstract domination onto the supposed mediators\nof capitalism, while rejecting as elitist \u201call claims to a qualitative\ndifference transcending exchange\u201d (Jarvis 1998, 63).\n\n\nAdorno's cultural studies show that a similar logic prevails in\ntelevision, film, and the recording industries. In fact, Adorno first\ndiscovered late capitalism's structural change through his work with\nsociologist Paul Lazarsfeld on the Princeton University Radio Research\nProject. He articulated this discovery in a widely anthologized essay\n\u201cOn the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening\u201d\n(1938) and in \u201cThe Culture Industry,\u201d a chapter in Dialectic of\nEnlightenment.  There Adorno argues that the culture industry\ninvolves a change in the commodity character of art, such that art's\ncommodity character is deliberately acknowledged and art \u201cabjures its\nautonomy\u201d (DE 127). With its emphasis on marketability, the culture\nindustry dispenses entirely with the \u201cpurposelessness\u201d that was\ncentral to art's autonomy. Once marketability becomes a total demand,\nthe internal economic structure of cultural commodities\nshifts. Instead of promising freedom from societally dictated uses,\nand thereby having a genuine use value that people can enjoy, products\nmediated by the culture industry have their use value\nreplaced by exchange value: \u201cEverything has value only\nin so far as it can be exchanged, not in so far as it is something in\nitself. For consumers the use value of art, its essence, is a fetish,\nand the fetish\u2014the social valuation [gesellschaftliche\nSch\u00e4tzung] which they mistake for the merit [Rang]\nof works of art\u2014 becomes its only use value, the only quality\nthey enjoy\u201d (DE 128). Hence the culture industry dissolves the\n\u201cgenuine commodity character\u201d that artworks once possessed\nwhen exchange value still presupposed use value (DE\n129\u201330). Lacking a background in Marxist theory, and desiring to\nsecure legitimacy for \u201cmass art\u201d or \u201cpopular\nculture,\u201d too many of Adorno's anglophone critics simply ignore\nthe main point to his critique of the culture industry. His main point\nis that culture-industrial hypercommercialization evidences a fateful\nshift in the structure of all commodities and therefore in the\nstructure of capitalism itself.\n",
