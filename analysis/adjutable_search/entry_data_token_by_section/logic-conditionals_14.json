    "main_text": "Probabilistic Logics || Lewis\u2019s triviality theorem\n5.2 Lewis\u2019s triviality theorem\n\nViewed as logics that tell us which conditionals are consequences of a\ngiven set of conditionals, Adams\u2019s logic coincides, over their\ncommon language, with Stalnaker\u2019s and Lewis\u2019s logics. That\nis, for every argument with a finite set of premises \\(\\Gamma\\) and\nconclusion \\(A\\) of \\(L_1\\), \\(A\\) is a \\(p\\)-consequence of\n\\(\\Gamma\\) iff \\(A\\) is a consequence of \\(\\Gamma\\) according to\nStalnaker\u2019s semantics (see Gibbard 1980 for a\n proof).[7]\n However, the main limit of Adams\u2019s logic is that it does not\naccount for embeddings of conditionals (negated conditionals,\ndisjunctions of conditionals, right-nested and left-nested\nconditionals). Nevertheless, the coincidence of the logics generated\nby possible worlds and probabilistic semantics suggests that\nAdams\u2019 Thesis could be extended to the language \\(L_2\\) of\narbitrarily complex conditionals. This hypothesis is known as\nStalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis, who formulates it in his 1970\n article.[8]\n\n(Stalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis) For every\nprobability function \\(\\Pr\\) and for every conditional \\(A>C\\),\npossibly complex: \\(\\Pr(A>C)=\\Pr(C\\mkern2mu|\\mkern2muA)\\), provided\nthat \\(\\Pr(A)>0\\).\n\n\nThe empirical adequacy of Stalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis depends on the\ntreatment of nested conditionals. However, Lewis (1976) shows that\nunder rather uncontroversial assumptions on the probability of nested\nconditionals, the thesis leads to triviality. Lewis assumes the\nfollowing Factorization Hypothesis (Fitelson 2015):\n\n(Factorization Hypothesis) For every probability\nfunction \\(\\Pr\\) and for all sentences \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) such that\n\\(\\Pr(A\\wedge B)>0\\):\n\\[\\Pr(B >C\\mid A)=\\Pr(C\\mid A\\wedge B).\\]\n\n\nGiven Stalnaker\u2019s Hypothesis, the Factorization Hypothesis is\nequivalent to the Law of Import-Export, namely \\(\\Pr(A > (B >\nC))=\\Pr((A\\wedge B) > C).\\)\n\nFrom Factorization, Lewis derives the following result, which\nbasically expresses that the probability of the conditional collapses\nto the unconditional probability of its consequent:\n\nTriviality Theorem (Lewis) If \\(A\\) is\nprobabilistically compatible with both \\(C\\) and \\(\\neg C\\), that is,\nif \\(\\Pr(A\\wedge C)>0\\) and \\(\\Pr(A\\wedge \\neg C)>0\\), then\n\\(\\Pr(A>C)=\\Pr(C)\\).\n\n\nThe proof goes as follows: \n\n\\[\\begin{align} \n\\Pr(A> C)&=\\Pr(A>C\\mid C)\\Pr(C) + \\Pr(A>C\\mid \\neg C)\\Pr(\\neg C) \\\\\n  & \\hspace{4cm} {\\scriptsize\\text{(Expansion)}}\\\\ \n\\Pr(A>C\\mid C)&=\\Pr(C\\mid A\\wedge C) = 1 \\\\\n  & \\hspace{4cm} {\\scriptsize\\text{(by Factorization)}}\\\\ \n\\Pr(A>C\\mid \\neg C)&=\\Pr(C\\mid A\\wedge \\neg C) = 0 \\\\\n  & \\hspace{4cm} {\\scriptsize\\text{(by Factorization)}}\\\\ \n\\Pr(A>C)&=1\\cdot \\Pr(C)+0\\cdot \\Pr(\\neg C) = \\Pr(C) \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nLewis himself states further variants, and several generalizations\nhave been proposed since (H\u00e1jek & Hall 1994; Bradley 2000;\nMilne 2003; Fitelson 2015). Bradley (2000) in particular shows that\nthe following Preservation Condition inspired by Belief Revision\ntheory also leads to triviality.\n\nPreservation Condition (Bradley): For every\nprobability function \\(\\Pr\\) and all sentences \\(A\\) and \\(C\\), if\n\\(\\Pr(A)>0\\) and \\(\\Pr(C)=0\\), then \\(\\Pr(A>C)=0\\).\n\n\nThe condition is weaker than Stalnaker\u2019s Thesis, and therefore\nit extends triviality to an even wider class of conditionals.\n",
