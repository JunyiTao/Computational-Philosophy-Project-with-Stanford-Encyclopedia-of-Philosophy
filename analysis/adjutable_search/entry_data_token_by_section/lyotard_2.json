    "main_text": "Major Works || The Limits of Representation\n3.1 The Limits of Representation\n\nLyotard\u2019s writings of the early 1970s were, it\u2019s fair to\nsay, far less influential at the time than, say, the writings of\nMichel Foucault (1926\u20131984) or Jacques Derrida\n(1930\u20132004). Yet, like Julia Kristeva (1941\u2013), who\ndeveloped in well-known articles leading to The Revolution in\nPoetic Language (1974) the distinction between the semiotic (the\nlibidinal disruptiveness of bodily motility) and the symbolic (the\nstructured grammar whose extreme form is mathematics) that together\nmake language possible, Lyotard was interested in what escapes\ndiscourse but yet needs it to exist, just as there is no pure semiotic\nor symbolic language for Kristeva. In Discourse, Figure\n(1971), Lyotard differentiates discourse, that is, the written text\ninvestigated by semiotics and structuralism, and the figural, that is,\nthe visual, which he discusses through the phenomenology of\nMerleau-Ponty. Lyotard\u2019s work was avowedly a shot across the bow\nat structuralism, whether found in Lacan\u2019s reading of Sigmund\nFreud (1856\u20131939) or Louis Althusser\u2019s (1918\u20131990)\nstructuralist Marxism. As he put it in a later interview, \u201cI was\nagainst this way of thinking\u201d, and for that reason the book was\n\u201cignored at the time because it was explicitly against\nstructuralism\u201d (\u201cResisting a Discourse of Mastery\u201d,\n191). For Lyotard, the emphasis on the written text in structuralism\ncontinues the Western tradition\u2019s emphasis on the intellectual\nover the sensual. The figural is the disruptive force that is\nirreducible to any systemic or linguistic approach to language. For\nthis reason, Lyotard valorizes the eye and its modes of seeing\nfigures\u2014shadings of meanings\u2014that cannot be reduced to a\nsingle meaning or representation. The figural is what makes it\nimpossible to collapse language into pure signification, what Kristeva\nwould dub the symbolic, and this makes changes in language possible,\nas seen in poetry and literature. Discourse and figure, however, are\nnot opposed but are co-implicated: texts always contain figures\n(metaphors and the poetic in general) while visual milieu would be\nchaotic without being ordered or structured discursively such that one\ncan perceptually make one\u2019s way about the world. In this way,\nwhat is libidinal and sensual is not, as Lacan argued, structured like\na language, and Lyotard\u2019s writings testify to an attunement of\nfigural events that disrupt pre-given significations.\n\nLibidinal Economy, published three years later, is one he\nlater denounced, but remains an important examination of\ndesire\u2019s place as the driver of the political while also\ncritiquing political and linguistic models of representation. The book\nis very much a reflection of its era: Deleuze and Felix\nGuattari\u2019s (1930\u20131992) Anti-Oedipus had come out\nin 1972, arguing against Freudian accounts of repression while\noffering an immanentist ontology whereby all events had to be\naccounted for without reference to an outside or be confused with the\nrepresentations made of them. Lyotard follows Friedrich Nietzsche\n(1844\u20131900) in arguing that there is no objective science or\nforms of knowledge that are not based in a desire or what Nietzsche\ncalled a will for power, a point that Lyotard will make by looking at\nthe desire or libido behind the so-called scientific works of the\nlater Marx. Libidinal Economy is not an easy read, not least\nsince it does not wish to set itself up as merely another\nphilosophical theory hiding its own desires, with a truth easily\nrepresentable to others (Libidinal, 244). While Freud largely\ndiscussed the libido at the individual level as a form of energy\ncirculating within the body and necessitating societal laws that led\nto the formation of an internal superego keeping these energies in\ncheck, Lyotard greatly extends the idea of the libido to think of\npolitical economy as really a libidinal economy. In sum, he looks to\nany stable formations within society as libidinal fields, whether we\nare discussing linguistics, economics, or architecture.  For\nLyotard, Freud\u2019s notion of the pleasure principle (Eros)\nprovides for this stabilizing effect of the other side of our drives,\nnamely the death drive (Thanatos), which seeks out intensities,\nwhether high or low, that destabilize institutions. These\ntransformations occur through certain techniques\n(dispositifs, a term important in Foucault\u2019s work of\nthe time) that guide these energies and which are themselves almost\nprecarious formations of energies themselves: the body, works of art,\nfinancial systems, texts, theoretical systems, and so forth. The\nmutations caused by the libidinal economy are events. The libido\nitself, its energetics, is never representable or containable within\nany given system; all desires are dissimulated in these institutions,\nand they are never presentable as they are in themselves. This is\nquite similar to what Deleuze and Guattari discuss in terms of\norganisms and and the body without organs in Anti-Oedipus two\nyears earlier, and both texts are often read as encouraging these\nflows of energy, that is, the creation of the highest intensities,\nover forms of organization that tamp down these events. For this\nreason, both books will be critiqued as being irresponsibly anarchist.\nFor Lyotard, structures and institutions tend to totalize and exploit\nintensities for their own good, and thus lay claim to all proper\ninterpretations of these intensities. But where Deleuze and Guattari\ndifferentiate fascistic and liberating forms of desire, Lyotard argues\nit is impossible to do so. Hence, for example, he will say that\ncapitalism is a liberating form of libidinal economy, since it\noverthrows all manner of institutions in the name of the accumulation\nof more and more money. Against Marx, he argues that our innate\ndesires are not alienated in capitalism, but rather that capitalism is\nanother means for the death drive to demolish those entities in its\nway, such as when capitalist expansion undoes traditional values and\nprevious forms of economics. And just as in capitalism, where it\nmatters not what goods are in circulation as long as there is an\naccumulation of capital, desires are neutral as to their locale.\nIndeed, later in interviews he will argue for at least passing through\ncapitalism for those facing economic hardship.\n\u201cCapitalism\u201d, he will say in 1995, \u201cis the only\nsolution\u201d for the unemployed and dispossessed, and there is\n\u201cno competition\u201d to capitalism for doing so\n(\u201cResisting a Discourse of Mastery\u201d, 182). Only once one\nhas a job, food, and housing, he goes on, can \u201creal resistance\nappear\u201d.\n\nIn any event, as Lyotard puts it, there is \u201cnot good or bad\nintensities, then, but intensity or its decompression\u201d\n(Libidinal, 42). But this leaves, then, open a question that\nhaunts other similar projects of the time: if each intensity is not to\nbe thought outside of itself in terms of some representation or\nmeasure, then what ethics is available when all intensities are only\nto be thought in terms of their inherent efficacy? From what place, then,\ncan one deem one set of intensities or libido economy\n\u201cbad\u201d over and against another? If all can and, it seems\nin Lyotard\u2019s text, should come undone, then are we merely\npositing a nihilism?\n",
