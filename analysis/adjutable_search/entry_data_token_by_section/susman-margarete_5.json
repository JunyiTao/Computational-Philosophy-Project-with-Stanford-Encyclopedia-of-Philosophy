    "main_text": "Homelessness, Exile, Hope, and Redemption\n6. Homelessness, Exile, Hope, and Redemption\n\nSusman\u2019s insistence on the underlying role of religion for\nunderstanding metaphysics and the task of philosophical inquiry as\nwell as modern life more generally remains constant. Her analysis of\nthe modern condition recognizes the philosophical necessity of\nunderstanding the religious dimension of the experience of modernity.\nInformed by a post-secular sensibility, Susman views the religious\ndimension as determinative of the grounds from which metaphysics\narises. For Susman, philosophy must therefore include the practice of\naddressing the significance of its own theological-political\ncommitments.\n\nFor Susman, homelessness, alienation, exile, hope, and redemption are\nmore than terms that help us articulate the loss, failures, and the\naspirations that inform the modern experience. They also demonstrate\nthat we can only grasp the predicament of modern existence if we are\nwilling to scrutinize it by sourcing the critical potential that the\nbiblical tradition offers. Like Hermann Cohen, Buber, and Rosenzweig,\nwho likewise have recourse to the \u201csources of Judaism\u201d\n(Cohen 1919) in order to examine the predicament of modern existence,\nSusman finds in the Jewish tradition a vital resource.\n\nThe primordial condition in which humans find themselves is\ncharacterized by homelessness and suffering. Facing the infinitude of\nthe world as the finite beings that we are, we experience the world as\nover against us and strange. The certainty of our future death reminds\nus that we are something other than the world:\n\n\nAnd in this being other [Anderssein] we at the same time\ngrasp our deepest particularity [unser tiefstes Eigenes].\nWhat we humans actually are we are by way of our homelessness in the\nworld: through our death and through the knowledge of our impending\ndeath. Human life is per se existence in an alien world and as such\nsuffering. (\u201cDas Judentum als Weltreligion\u201d\n[\u201cJudaism: A World Religion\u201d], 1932 [GF 105] [RPE 74])\n\n\nThe need to face this condition \u201cshared by all humans of all\ntimes and places\u201d is what gives rise to religion in general\n(ibid.).\n\nTen years later, in the middle of WWII and facing the ravaging effects\nof the Shoa, Susman notes that the Jewish plight only reflects in the\nextreme what has become the universal human condition as that of\nhomelessness of the human being on earth, a life in exile; Jewish\nexistence intensifies this condition into an \u201cexile in\nexile\u201d, scattered among all other nations, \u201cthe only\npeople without a land, state, and power\u201d (\u201cEzechiel der\nProphet der Umkehr\u201d, [\u201cEzekiel: The Prophet of\nReturn\u201d] 1942, DBG 73f. [RPE 109 f.]). The diasporic existence\nof the Jewish people has become a reminder that the modern human\ncondition has become quintessentially diasporic. As Susman observes in\n\u201cDas Hiob-Problem bei Franz Kafka\u201d (\u201cThe Question of\nJob in Franz Kafka\u201d, 1929: 45 [RPE 67]): \u201cWe are\nabsolutely and entirely in exile\u201d. Not only does the Jewish\npeople lack its own country, state, and political power, but its mode\nof existence suggests the obsolescence of conventional political\nwisdom, a vision that aligns with Landauer\u2019s and also has\nrecourse to the prophetic tradition. The stubborn and categorical\nresistance to instrumental reasoning lodged in this thought suggests\nthat philosophy that turns a deaf ear to creaturely laments and human\nsuffering does not live up to its claims of universal truth.\nPhilosophical thinking that is attuned to suffering is, to\nSusman\u2019s mind, on the other hand, receptive enough to address\nthe existential need for hope and redemption. Rather than authorizing\nsome cordoned-off philosophy of religion to cater to this need,\nthough, Susman alters philosophy\u2019s approach so that hope can be\nrecognized from within philosophy as a legitimate category crucial for\nthe emancipatory task of thought. But it is the recourse to prophecy,\nSusman maintains, that has first created the notion of world history\nin the proper sense as its vision attends to the undying dream of the\nhuman heart to illuminate the whole of human history (\u201cDie\nFriedensbotschaft der Propheten\u201d, [DBG 134]). As Susman argues,\nthe promise of the prophets lies ahead of us:\n\n\nWe have no need of new prophets [\u2026] Every word of the prophets\nof old Israel goes straight to the truth of our time as if it had been\nspoken just now. (\u201cDie messianische Idee als Friedensidee\u201d\n[\u201cThe Messianic Idea as the Idea of Peace\u201d] 1929 [GF\n61])\n\n\nThe messianic idea of world peace, this great vision of the prophets,\nhints at the way religious thought informs the very core of\nmodernity\u2019s aspirations without rendering that core a mere\ntheological affair. The messianic vision of a united and peaceful\nhumanity situated in a pure futurity at the end of time may seem\nunreasonable and ungrounded, but that is Susman\u2019s point:\n\u201cThe messianic hope is hope without a foundation\u201d\n(\u201cDie Messianische Idee als Friedensidee\u201d, GF 59). Susman\nsuggests that, rather than being exclusively reason-based, the\nMessianic idea of peace presents a genuinely universal form of\nthinking because it takes its cue from a paradoxical structure that\nenvisions the universal as reflecting its own particularity in a way\nthat mirrors the paradox of human existence on Earth (GF 60):\n\u201cthe overpowering law of God and the ultimate depths of the\nhuman heart are nothing that is separated\u201d (\u201cJudentum als\nWeltreligion\u201d, GF 121 [RPE 87]). While resonating with a\nKierkegaardian sense of paradox, Susman is here signaling closer\naffiliation with the Jewish strand of dialogical thinking of Buber and\nRosenzweig. When universal thinking launches off from this starting\npoint, the impossible can become its liberating force. Working in a\ndifferent register, Susman conveys this thought of the impossible in\nthe following way:\n\n\nFor it is part of the human beings that they are unable to stand on\nthemselves, that they cannot be their own ground to stand on; they\ncannot determine their own above or below entirely according to\nthemselves. Only in the stars above do they recognize the grounds\nunder their feet, do they measure their above and below.\n(\u201cWandlungen der Frau\u201d, 1933 [hereafter WF] [GK 174])\n\n",
