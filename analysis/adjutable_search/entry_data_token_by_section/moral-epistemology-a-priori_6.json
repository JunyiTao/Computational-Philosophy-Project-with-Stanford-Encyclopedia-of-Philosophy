    "main_text": "A Priori Justification and Late 20th Century Naturalism\n4. A Priori Justification and Late 20th Century Naturalism\n\nWhile hugely influential, Moore\u2019s open question argument is far\nfrom unassailable. One influential response points out that it\nimplausibly assumes any correct definition or analysis must be\nobvious. According to this response, the open question argument\nimplausibly assumes the correct response to the paradox of analysis is\nto deny that any analysis could be both correct and informative (see\nentry on\n analysis).\n So, the open question argument is no longer taken as decisive. In\naddition, a majority of philosophers do not want to admit non-natural\nentities into their ontologies. Finally, many judge that\nnon-cognitivist and anti-realist theories cannot really do justice to\nthe status of morality. It therefore is no surprise that naturalist\nethical theories, which hold that moral properties and facts just are\nnatural properties and facts, gained prominence towards the end of the\n20th century. One such view, analytic naturalism, directly\ncontradicts Moore by holding that all ethical terms have naturalistic\nanalyses. It might seem that a priori justification would\nplay a prominent role in at least those naturalistic theories that\noffer analyses of moral terms, but as we will see, this is\nnot so obvious (see entry on\n moral naturalism).\n\nWe will focus primarily on the role of the a priori in\nanalytic naturalism. However, perhaps a good entry point into the view\nis via comparison with a very different view: Cornell realism.\n",
