    "main_text": "Some Philosophical Background\n1. Some Philosophical Background\n\nPeople often behave in ways that benefit others, and they sometimes do\nthis knowing that it will be costly, unpleasant or dangerous. But at\nleast since Plato\u2019s classic discussion in the second Book of the\nRepublic, debate has raged over why people behave in\nthis way. Are their motives really altruistic, or is their\nbehavior ultimately motivated by self-interest? Famously, Hobbes gave\nthis answer:\n\n\nNo man giveth but with intention of good to himself, because gift is\nvoluntary; and of all voluntary acts, the object is to every man his\nown good; of which, if men see they shall be frustrated, there will be\nno beginning of benevolence or trust, nor consequently of mutual help.\n(1651 [1981]: Ch. 15)\n\n\nViews like Hobbes\u2019 have come to be called\n egoism,[1]\n and this rather depressing conception of human motivation has\napparently been favored, in one form or another, by a number of\neminent philosophical advocates, including Bentham, J.S. Mill and\n Nietzsche.[2]\n Egoism was also arguably the dominant view about human motivation in\nthe social sciences for much of the twentieth century (Piliavin &\nCharng 1990: 28; Grant 1997). Dissenting voices, though perhaps fewer\nin number, have been no less eminent. Butler, Hume, Rousseau, and Adam\nSmith have all argued that, sometimes at least, human motivation is\ngenuinely altruistic.\n\nThough the issue dividing egoistic and altruistic accounts of human\nmotivation is largely empirical, it is easy to see why philosophers\nhave thought that the competing answers will have important\nconsequences for moral theory. For example, Kant famously argued that\na person should act \u201cnot from inclination but from duty, and by\nthis would his conduct first acquire true moral worth\u201d (1785\n[1949]: Sec. 1, parag. 12). But egoism maintains that all\nhuman motivation is ultimately self-interested, and thus people\ncan\u2019t act \u201cfrom duty\u201d in the way that Kant\nurged. Thus if egoism is true, Kant\u2019s account would entail that\nno conduct has \u201ctrue moral worth\u201d. Additionally, if egoism\nis true, it would appear to impose a strong constraint on how a moral\ntheory can answer the venerable question \u201cWhy should I be\nmoral?\u201d since, as Hobbes clearly saw, the answer will have to\nground the motivation to be moral in the agent\u2019s\nself-interest.\n\nThere are related implications for political philosophy. If the\negoists are right, then the only way to motivate prosocial\nbehavior is to give people a selfish reason for engaging in such\nbehavior, and this constrains the design of political institutions\nintended to encourage civic-minded behavior. John Stuart Mill, who was\nboth a utilitarian and an egoist, advocated a variety of manipulative\nsocial interventions to engender conformity with utilitarian moral\nstandards from egoistic moral\n agents.[3]\n\nIt is easy to find philosophers suggesting that altruism is required\nfor morality or that egoism is incompatible with morality\u2014and\neasier still to find philosophers who claim that other\nphilosophers think this. Here are a few examples culled from a\nstandard reference work that happened to be close at hand:\n\n\nMoral behavior is, at the most general level, altruistic behavior,\nmotivated by the desire to promote not only our own welfare but the\nwelfare of others. (Rachels 2000: 81)\n\n[O]ne central assumption motivating ethical theory in the Analytic\ntradition is that the function of ethics is to combat the inherent\negoism or selfishness of individuals. Indeed, many thinkers define the\nbasic goal of morality as \u201cselflessness\u201d or\n\u201caltruism\u201d. (W. Schroeder 2000: 396)\n\nPhilosophers since Socrates worried that humans might be capable of\nacting only to promote their own self-interest. But if that is all we\ncan do, then it seems morality is impossible. (LaFollette 2000a: 5)\n [4]\n\n\nWhile the egoism/altruism debate has historically been of great\nphilosophical interest, the issue centrally concerns psychological\nquestions about the nature of human motivation, so it\u2019s no\nsurprise that psychologists have done a great deal of empirical\nresearch aimed at determining which view is correct. The psychological\nliterature will be center-stage in\n section 5,\n the longest section in this entry, and in\n section 6.\n But before considering the empirical literature, it is important to be clear \non what the debate is about.\n",
