    "main_text": "Contemporary Theories of Political Obligation || Fair Play\n4.2 Fair Play\n\nAlthough earlier philosophers, including Socrates, appealed to\nsomething resembling the principle of fairness (or fair play), the\nclassic formulation of the principle is set out in H. L. A.\nHart\u2019s \u201cAre There Any Natural Rights?\u201d As Hart there\nsays, \u201cwhen a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise\naccording to rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have\nsubmitted to these restrictions when required have a right to a\nsimilar submission from those who have benefited by their\nsubmission\u201d (1955, p. 185). John Rawls subsequently adopted this\nprinciple in an influential essay of his own, referring to the duty\nderived from the principle as the \u201cduty of fair play\u201d\n(1964). What the principle of fair play holds, then, is that everyone\nwho participates in a reasonably just, mutually beneficial cooperative\npractice \u2013 Hart\u2019s \u201cjoint enterprise according to\nrules\u201d \u2013 has an obligation to bear a fair share of the\nburdens of the practice. This obligation is owed to the others who\ncooperate in the enterprise, for cooperation is what makes it possible\nfor any individual to enjoy the benefits of the practice. Anyone who\nacts as a free rider is acting wrongly, then, even if his or her\nshirking does not directly threaten the existence or success of the\nendeavor. Those who participate in the practice thus have rights\nagainst as well as obligations to one another: a right to require\nothers to bear their share of the burdens and an obligation to bear\none\u2019s share in turn.\n\nThe principle of fair play applies to a political society only if its\nmembers can reasonably regard it as a cooperative enterprise that\nworks to their mutual benefit. If it can, the members have an\nobligation of fair play to do their part in maintaining the\nenterprise. Because the rule of law is necessary to the maintenance of\nsuch a polity \u2013 and perhaps even constitutive of it \u2013 the\nprincipal form of cooperation is abiding by the law. In the absence of\noverriding circumstances, then, the members of the polity qua\ncooperative practice must honor their obligation to one another to\nobey the laws. In this way the principle of fair play provides the\ngrounding for a general obligation to obey the law, at least on the\npart of those whose polity they can reasonably regard as a cooperative\nenterprise.\n\nThe argument from fair play has met with serious criticism, however.\nThe most sweeping is that of Robert Nozick, who objects that the\nprinciple of fair play would allow others to place us under an\nobligation to them simply by conferring benefits on us (1974, pp.\n90\u201395). To make his point, Nozick imagines a group of neighbors\ncreating a public entertainment system and assigning every adult in\nthe neighborhood a day on which he or she is responsible for planning\nand broadcasting a program. As a resident of the neighborhood, you\noccasionally hear and enjoy the programs, but you never consent to\ntake part in this scheme. When your assigned day arrives, are you\nobligated to take a turn? The principle of fair play says yes,\naccording to Nozick, but the correct answer to the question is\n\u201csurely not.\u201d\n\nAccording to a second objection, fair-play considerations apply only\nto cooperative schemes that produce benefits one may refuse. If it\nproduces nonexcludable goods, which everyone receives regardless of\nwhether she contributed to their production or even wants them, then\nthere can be no fair-play obligation to bear a share of the burdens of\nthe enterprise. But this is typically the case in political societies,\nwhich produce goods such as public order and national defense that one\ncannot meaningfully refuse to accept. As Simmons puts it (1979, p.\n129), there is a difference between receiving and\naccepting benefits, and receiving them is not enough to place\nsomeone under an obligation. If there is a political obligation,\ntherefore, it does not follow directly from the existence of the kind\nof nonexcludable goods that states provide. To be sure, Simmons does\nacknowledge that some people may acquire fair-play obligations by\nenjoying nonexcludable benefits that they take to be \u201cworth the\nprice [they] pay for them\u201d if they do so in full awareness that\n\u201cthe benefits are provided by a cooperative\nscheme\u201d (1979, p. 132; emphasis in original). But he also\nmaintains that few people will satisfy both of these conditions, with\nthe second proving especially troublesome for advocates of fair-play\ntheory: for \u201ceven in democratic political communities, these\nbenefits are commonly regarded as purchased (with taxes) from a\ncentral authority, rather than as accepted from the cooperative\nefforts of our fellow citizens\u201d (1979, p. 139).\n\nAs one might expect, advocates of the fair-play account have not\nremained silent in the face of these criticisms. The leading advocate,\nGeorge Klosko, has written two books elaborating and defending the\nprinciple of fairness as the foundation of political obligation (2004\n[1992], 2005), and it sometimes seems that every fresh attack on fair\nplay provokes a swift response (e.g., Carr 2002 and Lefkowitz 2004;\nZhu 2014 and Tosi 2017). And the attacks have certainly continued\n(e.g., Simmons 2001, chap. 2; McDermott 2004), as we shall indicate\nshortly. First, though, it is necessary to see how fair-play advocates\nhave responded to the criticisms sketched above.\n\nWith regard to Nozick\u2019s objection, the response is usually to\nhold that his example of the neighborhood entertainment system is\nbeside the point (Bell 1978). That is, Nozick is probably right to say\nthat one would have no obligation to operate the system on his or her\nassigned day, but he is wrong to think that fair play would require\none to do so. There is no fair-play obligation in cases such as this,\neither because the passive receipt of benefits is not enough to show\nthat one is a participant in a cooperative practice (Dagger\n1997, pp. 69\u201370) or because the benefits are \u201cof\nrelatively little value\u201d (Klosko 2004, pp. 38\u201339:).\nResponses to Simmons\u2019 objections have taken two directions. One\nis to say that Simmons has drawn too sharp a distinction between the\nacceptance and receipt of benefits. Between the person who passively\nreceives the benefits of a cooperative practice and the one who\nknowingly and willingly accepts them is the person \u2013 very many\npeople, in fact \u2013 who actively participates in the practice\nwithout being fully aware, in the ordinary course of life, that she is\nundertaking an obligation to do her part in a cooperative practice\n(Dagger 1997, pp. 73\u201378; Besson 2005, pp. 487\u201389). Others\nrespond to Simmons\u2019 criticism by denying that obligations must\nbe incurred voluntarily (Arneson 1982; Klosko 2004, pp. 39\u201357 ).\nWhat matters is not that one accepts the benefits of the practice,\naccording to Klosko\u2019s influential account, but that three\nconditions are met: \u201cGoods supplied must be (i) worth the\nrecipients\u2019 effort in providing them; (ii) \u2018presumptively\nbeneficial\u2019; and (iii) have benefits and burdens that are fairly\ndistributed\u201d ( 2004, p. 39 ). If, in sum, a state qualifies as a\ncooperative enterprise, and if it provides its members with goods that\nare presumptively beneficial \u2013 or \u201cindispensable for\nsatisfactory lives\u201d (Klosko 2005, p. 6) \u2013 then its members\nhave an obligation grounded in fairness to obey its laws.\n\nThese responses have not settled the debate in favor of a fair-play\naccount of political obligation. Simmons, for example, continues to\nhold that modern political societies are too large and impersonal to\ncount as cooperative enterprises (2001, pp. 38\u201342). He also\ncontends that Klosko\u2019s theory is \u201cnot really a\nfairness theory at all,\u201d but a \u201cdisguised Natural\nDuty theory, resting on an unstated moral duty to help supply\nessential goods locally \u2026\u201d (2005, p. 190, emphasis in\noriginal; also 2007, pp. 22\u201323). Others complain that fair-play\ntheory is not suitably sensitive to the possible alternatives there\nmay have been to the cooperative practices that have emerged. We may\nadmit, on this view, that people receive benefits from a cooperative\npractice, and even net benefits, but we should also notice that they\nmight have benefited more from the establishment of a different\npractice. To say, in these circumstances, that those who are engaged\nin a cooperative practice have an obligation to do their part is to\naccept the principle of fairness as \u201ca powerfully conservative\nprinciple\u201d (Normore 2010, p. 231). Yet having a fair-play\nobligation to the members of an ongoing enterprise does not bar anyone\nfrom trying to transform that enterprise, perhaps even by means of\ncivil disobedience (see the entry on Civil Disobedience).\n\nIn the political context, according to another critic, the proper\ncomparison is between a state of affairs in which benefits follow from\nother people\u2019s obeying the laws in the sense of mere compliance,\non the one hand, and a situation in which benefits follow from\nothers\u2019 obeying \u201cbecause the law says to do\nit\u201d (Durning 2003, p. 255). If the benefits are the same in both\ncases, then there is no reason to think that true cooperation, rather\nthan mere compliance, is producing the benefits, and hence no reason\nto think that those who receive the benefits have a fair-play\nobligation to obey the laws. This argument seems likely to do no more\nthan renew controversies about the nature of such societies and the\nviability of philosophical anarchism. The question is whether we can\nexpect a polity to survive if its \u201cmembers\u201d regard one\nanother not as cooperators in a common enterprise but exclusively as\npurchasers of governmental services who comply with the law under the\nthreat of coercion.\n",
