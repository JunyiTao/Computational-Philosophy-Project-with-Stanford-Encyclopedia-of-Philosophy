    "main_text": "Influences on Pyrrho\n8. Pyrrho\u2019s Influence\n\nPyrrho\u2019s relation to the later Pyrrhonists has already been\ndiscussed. Given the importance of Pyrrhonism in earlier modern\nphilosophy, Pyrrho\u2019s indirect influence may be thought of as\nvery considerable. But beyond his being adopted as a figurehead in\nlater Pyrrhonism\u2014itself never a widespread philosophical\nmovement \u2014 Pyrrho seems to have had very little impact in the\nancient world after his own lifetime. Both Cicero and Seneca refer to\nPyrrho as a neglected figure without a following, and the surviving\ntestimonia do not contradict this impression. It is possible that he\nhad some influence on the form of scepticism adopted by Arcesilaus and\nother members of the Academy; the extent to which this is so is\ndisputed and difficult to assess. It is also possible that the\nEpicureans, whose aim was also ataraxia, learned something\nfrom Pyrrho; there are indications of an association between Pyrrho\nand Nausiphanes, the teacher of Epicurus. But if so, the extent of the\nEpicureans\u2019 borrowing was strictly limited. For them,\nataraxia is to be attained by coming to understand that the\nuniverse consists of atoms and void; and the Epicureans\u2019\nattitude towards the senses was anything but one of mistrust.\n",
