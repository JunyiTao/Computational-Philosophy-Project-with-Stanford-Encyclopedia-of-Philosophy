Let\nus first consider the case where \\(\\bG\\) is a DAG. Then P satisfies\nthe Markov Condition (MC) relative to \\(\\bG\\) if and only it\nsatisfies these three conditions:\n\n\n(MCScreening_off)\n\nFor every variable X in \\(\\bV\\), and every set of variables\n\\(\\bY \\subseteq \\bV \\setminus \\DE(X)\\),\n\\(\\PP(X \\mid \\PA(X) \\amp \\bY) = \\PP(X \\mid \\PA(X))\\).\n\n\n(MCFactorization)\n\nLet \\(\\bV = \\{X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n\\}\\). Then\n\\(\\PP(X_1, X_2 , \\ldots ,X_n) = \\prod_i \\PP(X_i \\mid \\PA(X_i))\\).\n\n\n(MCd-separation)\n\nLet \\(X, Y \\in \\bV, \\bZ \\subseteq \\bV \\setminus \\{X, Y\\}\\). Then\n\\(\\PP(X, Y \\mid \\bZ) = \\PP(X \\mid \\bZ) \\times \\PP(Y \\mid\n\\bZ)\\)\nif \\(\\bZ\\) d-separates X and Y in \\(\\bG\\)\n(explained below).\n\n\n\nThese three conditions are equivalent when \\(\\bG\\) is a DAG.\n\nLet us take some time to explain each of these formulations.\n\nMCScreening_off says that the parents of variable X\nscreen X off from all other variables, except for the\ndescendants of X. Given the values of the variables that are\nparents of X, the values of the variables in \\(\\bY\\) (which\nincludes no descendants of \\(X)\\), make no further difference to the\nprobability that X will take on any given value.\n\nMCFactorization tells us that once we know the conditional\nprobability distribution of each variable given its parents, \\(\\PP(X_i\n\\mid \\PA(X_i))\\), we can compute the complete joint distribution\nover all of the variables. This captures Reichenbach\u2019s idea that\nprobability relations between variables that are not related as cause\nand effect are nonetheless derived from probability relations between\ncauses and effects.\n\nMCd-separation uses the graphical notion of\nd-separation, introduced by Pearl (1988). Let \\(X, Y \\in \\bV,\n\\bZ \\subseteq \\bV \\setminus \\{X, Y\\}\\). As noted above, a path from\nX to Y is a sequence of variables \\(\\langle X = X_1 ,\n\\ldots ,X_k = Y\\rangle\\) such that for each \\(X_i\\), \\(X_{i+1}\\),\nthere is either an arrow from \\(X_i\\) to \\(X_{i+1}\\) or an arrow from\n\\(X_{i+1}\\) to \\(X_i\\) in \\(\\bG\\). A variable \\(X_i , 1 \\lt i \\lt k\\)\nis a collider on the path just in case there is an arrow from\n\\(X_{i-1}\\) to \\(X_i\\) and from \\(X_{i+1}\\) to \\(X_i\\). That is,\n\\(X_i\\) is a collider on a path just in case two arrows converge on\n\\(X_i\\) in the path. \\(\\bZ\\) d-separates X and Y\njust in case every path \\(\\langle X = X_1 , \\ldots ,X_k = Y\\rangle\\)\nfrom X to Y contains at least one variable \\(X_i\\) such\nthat either: (i) \\(X_i\\) is a collider, and no descendant of \\(X_i\\)\n(including \\(X_i\\) itself) is in \\(\\bZ\\); or (ii) \\(X_i\\) is not a\ncollider, and \\(X_i\\) is in \\(\\bZ\\). MCd-separation\nstates that d-separation is sufficient for conditional\nindependence.\n\nNote that MC provides sufficient conditions for variables to be\nprobabilistically independent, conditional on others, but no necessary\ncondition. The Markov Condition entails many of the same screening off\nrelations as Reichenbach\u2019s Common Cause Principle, discussed in\n Section 2.3\n above. Here are some examples:\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nIn Figure 5, MC implies that X screens Y off from all of\nthe other variables, and that W screens Z off from all\nof the other variables. This is most easily seen from MCScreening\noff. W also screens T off from all of the other\nvariables, which is most easily seen from\nMCd-separation. MC does not imply that T\nscreens Y off from Z (or indeed anything from anything).\nWhile Y and Z do have a common cause that screens them\noff (W), not all common causes screen them off (T does\nnot have to), and not everything that screens them off is a common\ncause (X screens them off but is not a common cause).\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nIn Figure 6, MC entails that X and Y will be\nunconditionally independent, but not that they will be independent\nconditional on Z. This is most easily seen from\nMCd-separation.\n\nMC is not expected to hold for arbitrary sets of variables \\(\\bV\\),\neven when the graph \\(\\bG\\) accurately represents the causal relations\namong those variables. For example, MC will typically fail in the\nfollowing kinds of case:\n\nIn an EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) set-up, we have two particles\nprepared in the singlet state. If X represents a spin\nmeasurement on one particle, Y a spin measurement (in the same\ndirection) on the other, then X and Y are perfectly\nanti-correlated. (One particle will be spin-up just in case the other\nis spin-down.) The measurements can be conducted sufficiently far away\nfrom each other that it is impossible for one outcome to causally\ninfluence the other. However, it can be shown that there is no (local)\ncommon cause Z that screens off the two measurement outcomes.\n\nThe variables in \\(\\bV\\) are not appropriately distinct. For\nexample, suppose that X, Y, and Z are variables\nthat are probabilistically independent and causally unrelated. Now\ndefine \\(U = X + Y\\) and \\(W = Y + Z\\), and let \\(\\bV = \\{U, W\\}\\).\nThen U and W will be probabilistically dependent, even\nthough there is no causal relation between them.\nMC may fail if the variables are too coarsely grained. Suppose\nX, Y, and Z are quantitative variables, Z\nis a common cause of X and Y, and neither X nor\nY causes the other. Suppose we replace Z with a coarser\nvariable, \\(Z'\\) indicating only whether Z is high or low. Then\nwe would not expect \\(Z'\\) to screen X off from Y. The\nvalue of X may well contain information about the value of\nZ beyond what is given by \\(Z'\\), and this may affect the\nprobability of Y.\n\n\nIf there are latent common causes, we expect MCScreening\noff and MCFactorization to fail if we apply them in a\nna\u00efve way. For example, suppose that the true causal structure on\n\\(\\bV = \\{X, Y, Z\\}\\) is shown by the ADMG in Figure 7.\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nY is the only parent of Z shown in the graph, and if we\ntry to apply MCScreening_off, it tells us that Y\nshould screen X off from Z. However, we would expect\nX and Z to be correlated, even when we condition on\nY, due to the latent common cause. The problem is that the\ngraph is missing a relevant parent of Z, namely the omitted\ncommon cause. However, suppose that the probability distribution is\nsuch that if the latent cause L were added, the\nprobability distribution over the expanded set of variables would\nsatisfy MC with respect to the resulting DAG. Then it turns out that\nthe probability distribution will still satisfy\nMCd-separation with respect to the ADMG of\n Figure 8.\n This requires us to expand the definition of d-separation to\ninclude paths with double-headed arrows. For instance, Z is a\ncollider on the path \\(Y \\rightarrow Z \\leftrightarrow X\\) (since\nZ has two arrows pointing into it), but X is not a\ncollider on the path \\(Y \\leftarrow X \\leftrightarrow Z\\). Thus we\nwill say that a probability distribution P satisfies the Markov\nCondition relative to an ADMG just in case it satisfies\nMCd-separation.\n\nBoth SGS 2000 and Pearl 2009 contain statements of a principle called\nthe Causal Markov Condition (CMC), but they mean different\nthings. In Pearl\u2019s formulation, CMC is just a statement of a\nmathematical theorem: Pearl and Verma (1991) prove if each variable in\n\\(\\bV\\) is a deterministic product of its parents in \\(\\bV\\), together\nwith an error term; and the errors are probabilistically independent\nof each other; then the probability distribution on \\(\\bV\\) will\nsatisfy MC with respect to the DAG \\(\\bG\\). Pearl interprets this\nresult in the following way: Macroscopic systems, he believes, are\ndeterministic. In practice, however, we never have access to all of\nthe causally relevant variables affecting a macroscopic system. But if\nwe include enough variables in our model so that the excluded\nvariables are probabilistically independent of one another, then our\nmodel will satisfy the MC, and we will have a powerful set of analytic\ntools for studying the system. Thus MC characterizes a point at which\nwe have constructed a useful approximation of the complete system.\n\nIn SGS 2000, the CMC has more the status of an empirical posit. If\n\\(\\bV\\) is set of macroscopic variables that are well-chosen, meaning\nthat they are free from the sorts of defects described in points (ii)\nand (iii) above; \\(\\bG\\) is a graph representing the causal structure\non \\(\\bV\\); and P is the objective probability distribution resulting\nfrom this causal structure; then P can be expected to satisfy MC\nrelative to \\(\\bG\\). More precisely, P will satisfy all three versions\nof MC if \\(\\bG\\) is a directed acyclic graph, and P will satisfy\nMCd-separation if \\(\\bG\\) is an ADMG with\ndouble-headed arrows. SGS defend this empirical posit in two different\nways:\n\nEmpirically, it seems that a great many systems do in fact satisfy\nMC.\nMany of the methods that are in fact used to detect causal\nrelationships tacitly presuppose the MC. In particular, the use of\nrandomized trials presupposes a special case of the MC. Suppose that\nan experimenter determines randomly which subjects will receive\ntreatment with a drug \\((D = 1)\\) and which will receive a placebo\n\\((D = 0)\\), and that under this regimen, treatment is\nprobabilistically correlated with recovery (R). The effect of\nrandomization is to eliminate all of the parents of D, so MC\ntells us that if R is not a descendant of D, then\nR and D should be probabilistically independent. If we\ndo not make this assumption, how can we infer from the experiment that\nD is a cause of R?\n\n\nCartwright (1993, 2007: chapter 8) has argued that MC need not hold\nfor genuinely indeterministic systems. Hausman and Woodward (1999,\n2004) attempt to defend MC for indeterministic systems.\n\nA causal model that comprises a DAG and a probability distribution\nthat satisfies MC is called a causal Bayes net (CBN). A\ncausal model incorporating an ADMG and probability distribution\nsatisfying MCd-separation is called a\nsemi-Markov causal model (SMCM).\n",
