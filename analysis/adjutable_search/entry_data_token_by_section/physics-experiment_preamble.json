    "main_text": "\n\nPhysics, and natural science in general, is a reasonable enterprise\nbased on valid experimental evidence, criticism, and rational\ndiscussion. It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and\nit is experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this\nknowledge. Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its\nimportant roles is to test theories and to provide the basis for\nscientific\n knowledge.[1]\n It can also call for a new theory, either by showing that an accepted\ntheory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a new phenomenon that is in need\nof explanation. Experiment can provide hints toward the structure or\nmathematical form of a theory and it can provide evidence for the\nexistence of the entities involved in our theories. Finally, it may\nalso have a life of its own, independent of theory. Scientists may\ninvestigate a phenomenon just because it looks interesting. Such\nexperiments may provide evidence for a future theory to explain.\n[Examples of these different roles will be presented below.] As we\nshall see below, a single experiment may play several of these roles\nat once.\n\nIf experiment is to play these important roles in science then we must\nhave good reasons to believe experimental results, for science is a\nfallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,\nor the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.\nScience is more complex than \u201cThe scientist proposes, Nature\ndisposes.\u201d It may not always be clear what the scientist is\nproposing. Theories often need to be articulated and clarified. It\nalso may not be clear how Nature is disposing. Experiments may not\nalways give clear-cut results, and may even disagree for a time.\n\nIn what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment, a\nset of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimental\nresults. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on these\nexperimental results.\n",
