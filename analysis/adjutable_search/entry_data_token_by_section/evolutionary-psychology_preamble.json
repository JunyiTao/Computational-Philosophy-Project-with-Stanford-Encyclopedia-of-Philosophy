    "main_text": "\n\nEvolutionary psychology is one of many biologically informed\napproaches to the study of human behavior. Along with cognitive\npsychologists, evolutionary psychologists propose that much, if not\nall, of our behavior can be explained by appeal to internal\npsychological mechanisms. What distinguishes evolutionary\npsychologists from many cognitive psychologists is the proposal that\nthe relevant internal mechanisms are adaptations\u2014products of\nnatural selection\u2014that helped our ancestors get around the\nworld, survive and reproduce. To understand the central claims of\nevolutionary psychology we require an understanding of some key\nconcepts in evolutionary biology, cognitive psychology, philosophy of\nscience and philosophy of mind. Philosophers are interested in\nevolutionary psychology for a number of reasons. For philosophers of\nscience \u2014mostly philosophers of biology\u2014evolutionary\npsychology provides a critical target. Although here is a broad consensus among philosophers of biology that evolutionary psychology is a deeply flawed enterprise, this does not entail that these philosophers completely reject the relevance of evolutionary theory to human psychology. For philosophers of mind and cognitive science\nevolutionary psychology has been a source of empirical hypotheses\nabout cognitive architecture and specific components of that\narchitecture. However, some philosophers of mind are also critical of evolutionary\npsychology but their criticisms are not as all-encompassing as those\npresented by philosophers of biology. Evolutionary psychology is also\ninvoked by philosophers interested in moral psychology both as a\nsource of empirical hypotheses and as a critical target.\n\nIn what follows I briefly explain evolutionary psychology\u2019s\nrelations to other work on the biology of human behavior and the\ncognitive sciences. Next I introduce the research tradition\u2019s\nkey theoretical concepts. In the following section I take up\ndiscussions about evolutionary psychology in the philosophy of mind,\nspecifically focusing on the debate about the massive modularity\nthesis. I go on to review some of the criticisms of evolutionary\npsychology presented by philosophers of biology and assess some\nresponses to those criticisms. I then go on to introduce some of\nevolutionary psychology\u2019s contributions to moral psychology and\nhuman nature and, finally, briefly discuss the reach and impact of\nevolutionary psychology.\n",
