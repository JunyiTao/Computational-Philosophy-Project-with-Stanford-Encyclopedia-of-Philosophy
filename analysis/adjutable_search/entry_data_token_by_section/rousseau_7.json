    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Representation and government\n3.4 Representation and government\n\nOne feature of Rousseau\u2019s political philosophy that has proved\nleast persuasive to later thinkers is his doctrine of sovereignty and\nrepresentation, with his apparent rejection of \u201crepresentative\ngovernment\u201d. At the center of Rousseau\u2019s view in The\nSocial Contract is his rejection of the Hobbesian idea that a\npeople\u2019s legislative will can be vested in some group or\nindividual that then acts with their authority but rules over them.\nInstead, he argues that to hand over one\u2019s general right of\nruling oneself to another person or body is a form a slavery, and that\nto recognize such an authority would amount to an abdication of moral\nagency. This hostility to the representation of sovereignty also\nextends to the election of representatives to sovereign assemblies,\neven where those representatives are subject to periodic re-election.\nEven in that case, the assembly would be legislating on a range of\ntopics on which citizens have not deliberated. Laws passed by such\nassemblies would therefore bind citizens in terms that they have not\nthemselves agreed upon. Not only does the representation of\nsovereignty constitute, for Rousseau, a surrender of moral agency, the\nwidespread desire to be represented in the business of self-rule is a\nsymptom of moral decline and the loss of virtue.\n\nThe practical difficulties of direct self-rule by the entire citizen\nbody are obvious. Such arrangements are potentially onerous and must\nseverely limit the size of legitimate states. It is noteworthy that\nRousseau takes a different view in a text aimed at practical politics:\nConsiderations on the Government of Poland. Nevertheless, it\nis not entirely clear that the widespread interpretation of Rousseau\nas rejecting all forms of representative government is correct. One of\nthe key distinctions in The Social Contract is between\nsovereign and government. The sovereign, composed of the people as a\nwhole, promulgates laws as an expression of its general will. The\ngovernment is a more limited body that administers the state within\nthe bounds set by those laws, and which issues decrees applying them\nin particular cases. If the laws are conceived of as the people\nsetting a constitutional framework for society, with the\ngovernment\u2019s decrees comprising the more normal business of\n\u201clegislation,\u201d then the distance between a Rousseauian\nrepublic and a modern constitutional democracy may be smaller than it\nat first appears. In effect, while the sovereignty of the people may\nbe inconsistent with a representative model, the executive power of\nthe government can be understood as requiring it. Such a picture gains\ncredibility when the details of Rousseau\u2019s views on government\nare examined. Although a variety of forms of government turn out to be\ntheoretically compatible with popular sovereignty, Rousseau is\nsceptical about the prospects for both democracy (where the people\nconduct the day to day running of the state and the application of the\nlaws) and monarchy. Instead, he favors some form of elective\naristocracy: in other words, he supports the idea that the day-to-day\nadministration should be in the hands of a subset of the population,\nelected by them according to merit.\n\nTwo important issues arise in relation to Rousseau\u2019s account of\nrelations between sovereign and government. The first of these\nconcerns his political pessimism, even in the case of the\nbest-designed and most perfect republic. Just as any group has a\ncollective will as opposed to the individual private will of its\nmembers, so does the government. As the state becomes larger and more\ndiffuse, and as citizens become more distant from one another both\nspatially and emotionally, so the government of the republic will need\na proportionally smaller and more cohesive group of magistrates if its\nrule is to be effective. Rousseau thinks it almost inevitable that\nthis group will end up usurping the legitimate sovereign power of the\npeople and substituting its corporate will for the people\u2019s\ngeneral will. The second issue concerns how democratic Rousseau\nenvisaged his republic to be. He sometimes suggests a picture in which\nthe people would be subject to elite domination by the government,\nsince the magistrates would reserve the business of agenda-setting for\nthe assembly to themselves. In other cases, he endorses a conception\nof a more fully democratic republic. (For competing views of this\nquestion see Fralin 1978 and Cohen 2010.)\n\nAlthough Rousseau rejects Hobbes\u2019s view of the sovereign as\nrepresenting or acting in the person of the subject, he has a similar\nview of what sovereignty is and its relation to the rights of the\nindividual. He rejects the idea that individuals associated together\nin a political community retain some natural rights over themselves\nand their property. Rather, such rights as individuals have over\nthemselves, land, and external objects, are a matter of sovereign\ncompetence and decision. Individual rights must be specified by the\nsovereign in ways that are compatible with the interests of all in a\njust polity, and Rousseau rejects the idea that such rights could be\ninsisted on as a check on the sovereign\u2019s power.\n\nRousseau\u2019s commitment to the freedom and equality of citizens is\nmarred and limited to the fact that he envisages those citizens as\nexclusively male: women are subject to the authority of the state but\nhave no voice in the determination of the general will. While it is\ntempting for the modern reader simply to excuse this as reflective the\nprejudices of Rousseau\u2019s own times, his works are marked at\ntimes by a rather extreme misogyny which characterizes women as\nnecessarily inauthentic and fated to live in a world of appearance and\ndeception. Rousseau\u2019s insistence in Book I of the Social\nContract that the apparently slavish nature of some people might\nbe the consequence of their unjust subjection rather than a\njustification for it, is not a thought that he extends to the\nsubjection of women. Rousseau\u2019s inconsistencies and the tension\nbetween his liberatory philosophy and his exclusion of women was noted\nnot long after his death by Mary Wollstonecraft and has been the\nsubject of feminist critique in modern times (Fermon 1997,\nRousseli\u00e8re 2021, but see Rosenblatt 2002).\n",
