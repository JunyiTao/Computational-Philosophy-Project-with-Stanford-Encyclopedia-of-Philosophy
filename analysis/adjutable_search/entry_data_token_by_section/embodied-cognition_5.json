    "main_text": "Embodied Cognition: Themes and Close Relations || Embedded Cognition\n2.2 Embedded Cognition\n\n\nEmbedded cognition assumes that cognitive tasks\u2014dividing a\nnumber into fractions, navigating a large ship, retrieving the correct\nbook from a shelf\u2014require some quantity of cognitive effort.\nThe cognitive \u201cload\u201d that a task requires can be reduced\nwhen the agent embeds herself within an appropriately designed\nphysical or social environment. For instance, Martin and Schwartz\n(2005) found that children are more successful at calculating \u00bc\nof 8 when allowed to manipulate pie pieces than if only viewing the\npieces. The cognitive load required to navigate a large Navy vessel\nexceeds the capacity of any single individual, but can be distributed\nacross a number of specialists, each with his or her own particular\ntask (Hutchins 1996). Arranging books on a shelf alphabetically makes\nsearching for a particular title much easier than it would be if the\nbooks were simply set randomly upon the shelf. In all of these cases,\nthe cognitive capacities of an individual are enhanced when provided\nwith the opportunity to interact with features of a suitably organized\nphysical or social environment.\n",
