On this view, retentions (and perhaps\nprotentions) exist, but in the guise of neural mechanisms and\nprocesses that do not directly feature in consciousness. Carlos\nMontemayor (2013; Montemayor & Wittmann 2017) has defended this\nposition. Montemayor proposes that we distinguish the \u201csensorial\npresent\u201d from \u201cthe phenomenal present\u201d. The\nsensorial present represents stimuli as simultaneous, whereas the\nphenomenal present has a temporal extension of around half a second up\nto three seconds. Montemayor goes on to argue that it is a mistake to\nthink the cinematic, retentional and extensional models are mutually\nincompatible. The cinematic and retentional models correspond to his\nsensorial present, and whereas the (extensional) phenomenal present is\nphenomenally conscious, the sensorial present is only\naccess-conscious in Ned Block\u2019s sense. Merino-Rajme\n(2017) is impressed by the ingenuity of this proposal, but raises\ndoubts as to whether it is compatible with Block\u2019s conception of\nwhat access-consciousness involves.\n\nThomas Sattig (2019c) suggested that in his Raum und Zeit\n(1915) Anton Marty defended a hybrid model in which both retentional\nand extensional elements figure in temporal experience. Marty\u2019s\nposition is certainly intriguing, but since it confines the experience\nof change to momentary phases of experience it ultimately seems more\nretentionalist than extensionalist in character.\n\nIn a recent paper Rick Grush (2016\n [Other Internet Resources])\n distinguishes two sorts of perceptual content: A-ish content\nis structured in terms of past, present and future whereas\nB-ish content is structured in terms of earlier than,\nsimultaneous and later than. Grush points out that in discussions of\ntemporal experience it is generally (if tacitly) assumed that the\ncharacter of temporal experience has the same character at all\ntemporal scales, over short intervals of time, medium intervals and\nlong intervals. But what if this is not the case? What if our\nexperience isn\u2019t scale invariant? Grush proposes that\nat the larger temporal scales of seconds or minutes it is very\nplausible to think that our experience is A-ish in character. If you\nare watching an Olympic sprint, at around the mid-point some of the\nrace still lies in the future, some of it is in the past, and some of\nit is happening now. But perhaps it is different at smaller sub-second\ntemporal scales, and this is what Grush proposes: our experience is\nA-ish down to the scale of 200 msec, but beneath that it is B-ish:\n\n\nNo point in this interval is singled out as a now bracketed by a past\nand future. Rather, within this interval events are represented as\nstanding in relations of earlier than, simultaneous\nwith, and later than. But at scales greater than this,\nthis B-ishly structured interval of 200 msec effectively\nbecomes the bulky now of A-ish experience.\n(Grush 2016\n [OIR]:\n 8)\n\n\nGrush argues that holding that contents possess a B-ish character over\nshort intervals helps circumvent an otherwise serious \u201csurplus\ncontent\u201d problem that Dainton (2000, 2008a) has directed against\nretentional models.\n\nGerardo Viera also argues for a hybrid approach in which extensional\nand retentional (or atomist) models both have important play, but\nwhere neither applies universally, to all forms of temporal\nexperience. The grounds for this claim are scientific:\n\n\nempirical evidence suggests that temporal experience is fragmented and\ncomposed of many dissociable capacities to perceive the temporal\nstructure of our world. (Viera 2019: 33)\n\n\nViera\u2019s starting point is the current state of play in\nneuroscientific investigations into how the brain manages to keep\ntrack of time. The long-dominant assumption that the brain relies on\nthe regular beating of a single master-clock has been steadily\nundermined. If the master-clock existed and its functioning were\ndisrupted by drugs or neural damage we would expect this disruption to\nhave a devastating global impact on an individual\u2019s time-related\nabilities, but Viera points out that there are no known cases of\nneural damage which completely eliminate a person\u2019s\nability to perceive time. Coming from the other direction the\nhypothesis that timing and time perception depends on a multiplicity\nof different neural mechanisms has plenty of empirical support. When\nrapid transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is applied to the\nfrontal cortex the result is impaired timing in the second range; when\nrTMS is applied to the cerebellum timing in the millisecond range is\nimpaired. Ingesting psylocibin has no effect on the ability to\nperceive at timescales of less than 2 seconds, but severely impairs\nperception at longer timescales.\n\nIf our brains use a multiplicity of very different neural mechanisms\nwhen dealing with time then it is possible that the extensional model\napplies to some forms of temporal experience and the retentional model\nto other forms, Viera argues that this may well be the case. When it\ncomes to accounting for temporal perception at the sub-second level\nfor individual sensory modalities so-called intrinsic timing\nmodels are currently influential, these rely on the dynamics of\ntemporally extended neural processes to encode time, rather than any\nexternal clock. By way of an analogy, think of the way a pattern of\nripples on a lake carries information about the time that has elapsed\nsince a pebble was dropped. Viera suggests that any experiences this\ntype of extended neural process produces will themselves be temporally\nextended in an extensionalist manner, with the mirroring constraint\nwill be satisfied: the temporal features of successive phases of the\nneural process and the successive phases of the experience will\ncorrespond exactly. However, extensionalists don\u2019t have it all\ntheir own way. In the case of cross-modal perceptual order judgements\nat the timescale of less than one second Viera points out that there\nare cases where mirroring conspicuously fails. Experiments show that\nif a short delay is introduced between a button-pressing and a flash\nof light the two events seem to be occurring closer together in time\nthan they in fact are\u2014in some cases the ordering of the stimuli\nseems to be entirely reversed (Viera 2019: 39\u201340).\n\nViera draws an ambitious conclusion from these results: since the\nmirroring constraint is violated\n\n\nwe have a counterexample to extensionalism, and therefore neither\natomism nor extensionalism can provide us with a general theory for\nhow the temporal contents of experience relate to the temporal\nstructure of experience. (2019: 41)\n\n\nIt would be more accurate to hold that the cross-modal temporal order\njudgement case presents a potential problem for extensionalists who\nare committed to a very strict form of mirroring. Viera\u2019s\nargument poses no threat to extensionalists who are prepared to\nacknowledge that mirroring may sometimes fail to hold at shorter\ntime-scales.\n\nOn a number of occasions Ian Phillips (2010, 2018) has suggested that\na different sort of hybrid theory may well be worth taking seriously.\nPhillips proposes that the extensional and retentional approaches have\nmore in common than has usually been realized: there are grounds for\nthinking that both essentially depend on a form of memory.\nThe kind of memory Phillips has in mind is not the sort we can call up\nhours, days or months after the event we are\nrecollecting\u2014critics of the Reid-type memory theories are right\nto point out that memories of this kind are too unlike perception to\nfigure in temporal experience. The relevant type of memory is what\nJames called primary or elementary:\n\n\nan object of primary memory \u2026 never was lost; its date was\nnever cut off in consciousness from that of the immediately present\nmoment. In fact it comes to us as belonging to the rearward portion of\nthe present space of time, and not to the genuine past. (James 1890:\n646\u20137)\n\n\nPhillips argues that primary memory properly understood, is perceptual\nin character, and so capable of playing a role in role in experiences\nof succession by providing us with a direct link to the immediate\npast. Phillips takes his \u201crefined memory theory\u201d to be a\nmemory-based version of extensionalism. But he also proposes that,\nproperly understood, Husserl\u2019s theory is very similar:\nHusserl\u2019s retentions are also constitutively connected to the\npast, and by virtue of that could not exist in a momentary episode of\nconsciousness lacking that connection to the past. Adopting this\nperspective, Phillips argues, sheds valuable light on the entire\nfield. For it suggests that the fundamental division is between those\nwho those who claim\n\n\nthat it is only because our experience is a process which\nunfolds in time that it can acquaint us with the temporal structure of\nreality as it does.\u2026 (Phillips 2018: 17)\n\n\nand those who deny this. Phillips proposes that if we view matters\nthus\n\n\n\u2026 theorists who we might initially conceive of as rivals,\nnamely extensionalists such as Dainton, and retentionalists such as\nHusserl and O\u2019Shaughnessy, do not obviously disagree on\nsubstance. (2018: 21)\n\n\nBy way of further elaboration Phillips suggests the relation of\nco-consciousness which Dainton invokes to unify earlier and later\nphases of experience can itself be viewed as involving a form of\nmemory.\n\nThe suggestion that Dainton\u2019s co-consciousness relation could\namount to a form of memory is an interesting issue for future\ndiscussion. That aside, Phillips\u2019 claim that there is a divide\nof a fundamental kind between those who hold that experiences of\nsuccession require a succession of experiences on the one hand, and\nthose who hold that experiences of succession do not require\na succession of experiences on the other, is very plausible.\n\nIn his discussion of Phillips\u2019 work Wolf (2021) finds much to\nrecommend, but suggests that in its current form it lacks a decisive\nadvantage over the more orthodox extensional and retentional\napproaches. The solution, Wolf suggests, is to move in a more\ndynamic\u2014more Bergsonian direction\u2014by finding a way of\nincorporating Bergson\u2019s seemingly (but not really) paradoxical\nclaim that \u201cduration is essentially a continuation of what no\nlonger exists into what does exist\u201d. Wolf suggests that once\nthis is done the result is a more appealing form of Bergsonian\nextensionalism that has greater plausibility than the competing\nversions, Phillips\u2019 included.\n",
