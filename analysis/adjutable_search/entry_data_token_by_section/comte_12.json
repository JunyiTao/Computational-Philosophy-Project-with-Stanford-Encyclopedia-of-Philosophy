    "main_text": "The System of Positive Polity and the Complete Positivism || Ethics and sociology\n6. Conclusion\n\nOn the whole, the System was not well received. Almost\nimmediately, Mill and Littr\u00e9 put forward the idea that there\nwere a good Comte, the author of the Course, and a bad Comte,\nthe author of the System. However, it is impossible to\nconfine oneself merely to the Course. The early works had\nmade a strong impression on some of the best minds of the time; they\nremain required reading for everyone wishing to understand positive\nphilosophy, as they are still among the best introductions to the\nsubject. The Course was not part of the initial project,\nwhich Comte never lost sight of; the work is best considered as a\nparenthesis, admittedly open for twenty years, but which Comte had\nmeant to close very quickly. The reason why Comte had always presented\nthe Plan of 1822 as fundamental is that, beginning with the\nvery title, one finds the two themes that he planned to think through\nin their relation to one another: science and society. The foremost\nquestion is a political one: how should society be reorganized?\nScience, although present from the beginning, plays a secondary role\nas the means to achieve the chosen goal. All of Comte\u2019s work\naims at the foundation of a discipline in which the study of society\nwill finally become positive, scientific. His idea of sociology is not\nquite the one we are used to today; but the current meaning of the\nterm \u2018positivism\u2019, according to which it is merely a\nphilosophy of science, is even more misleading as a clue to\nComte\u2019s thought. Even though the founder of positivism is\nrightly considered to be one of the great philosophers of science,\nalong with Poincar\u00e9 and Carnap, his natural place is elsewhere,\nalong with sociologists such as his contemporaries Marx and\nTocqueville. Only when the question arises of what distinguishes Comte\nfrom the latter does science enter into the picture.\n\nThe limits of Comte\u2019s philosophy of science are easily seen, but\nthis does not diminish its value, which remains considerable. Yet the\nsame cannot be said of the positive polity. Given that the separation\nof spiritual power and temporal power rests on the separation between\ntheory and practice, Comte abstained from any direct political action,\nand, for example, condemned Mill\u2019s decision to stand in\nparliament. But his own project for the reorganization of society\npresents a similar problem. In his writings, it is difficult to\ndistinguish that which concerns objective social science from a reform\nprogram that reflects only a personal stand.\n\nApart from that difficulty, the weaknesses of the positive polity are\nnumerous. Among them, those that are the most conspicuous (criticism\nof human rights, praise of dictatorship) are not necessarily the most\nserious, for objections to the former are easily answered. For\nexample, while Comte criticizes freedom of conscience, he is always\nhighly supportive of freedom of expression. We should also find his\ndeep respect for spontaneity reassuring, considering that it is an\nimportant part of our idea of freedom. More serious, perhaps, seem to\nbe the consequences of the rejection of psychology. The moral\nquestion, \u2018What should I do?\u2019, is no longer asked in the\nfirst person, and is transformed into an engineering problem:\n\u2018What should be done to make men more ethical?\u2019 Similarly,\nthe positivists were invited to live openly, whereby the distinction\nbetween private and public lives disappears.\n\nHowever, considering only the weaknesses of the positive polity would\nnot be fair. Even if Comte was often mistaken, his theory of\nconsensus, as well as the seriousness with which he considered the\nquestion \u2018What religion after the death of God?\u2019 (to give\nbut two examples) are likely to help us resolve certain problems\nconfronting our society. Comte\u2019s thought is resolutely oriented\ntoward the future. The order of time, he said, is not\npast-present-future, but rather past-future-present. The latter, being\nonly \u2018a vague and fleeting span which fills the interval between\ntwo immensities of duration, and binds them together [\u2026], can\nonly be properly conceived with the aid of the two extremes which it\nunites and separates\u2019 (1851, v. 2, 364; E., v. 2, 296).\n\nA sound assessment of Comte\u2019s philosophy must also take into\naccount the work of his followers, a topic that has recently received\nrenewed attention, especially for England (Wilson 2019, 2021).\n",
