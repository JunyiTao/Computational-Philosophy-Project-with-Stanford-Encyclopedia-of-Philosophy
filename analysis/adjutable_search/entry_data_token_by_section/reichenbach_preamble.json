    "main_text": "\n\nDescribed as perhaps \u201cthe greatest empiricist of the 20th\ncentury\u201d (Salmon, 1977a), the work of Hans Reichenbach\n(1891\u20131953) provides one of the main statements of empiricist\nphilosophy in the 20th century. Provoked by the conflict between\n(neo-) Kantian a priorism and Einstein\u2019s relativity of space and\ntime, Reichenbach developed a scientifically inspired philosophy and\nan uncompromisingly empiricist epistemology. He was literate in the\nphysical science of his time, and acquainted with many of its most\neminent practitioners. Criticism and justification of scientific\nmethodology formed the core of almost all his philosophical efforts,\nwhich he promoted in a crescendo of books, in the journal\nErkenntnis, which he founded and edited with Rudolf Carnap,\nand within a group of philosophers, mathematicians and scientists he\nled in Berlin. His commitment to objectivity and realism in science\ntogether with his probabilistic justification of belief in scientific\nresults carried philosophical and technical difficulties that shaped\nmuch of the subsequent debate in philosophy of science.\nReichenbach\u2019s contributions cover large swathes of formal\nphilosophy, especially in philosophy of physics, logic, induction and\nthe foundations of probability, and his later work encompassed\nlinguistics, philosophical logic, and ethics. The fruits of some of\nhis insights are only belatedly having their full impact. For example,\nseveral of the recent accounts of causality employ ideas that can be\ntraced to Reichenbach\u2019s The Direction of Time. \n\nPartitioning the work of a philosopher with views about almost\neverything is indispensable in a retrospective, but in\nReichenbach\u2019s case separation is especially artificial. From\n1915 until 1953, most of his philosophical essays entangle issues and\ndoctrines about probability, causality, physics, epistemology and\nmetaphysics. Reichenbach\u2019s ideas about causality and probability\nare so intertwined that it makes little sense to discuss them\nseparately. Unavoidably, therefore, different aspects of the same\nworks are discussed in several sections of the following essay.\nReichenbach\u2019s views on all of these topics changed so radically\nover time that there is no one \u201cReichenbach system,\u201d and\nwe therefore offer a synoptic history of his views within each topic.\nAll of our citations are from the English editions of his\npublications, where available. \n",
