    "main_text": "Areas of Contemporary Activity || The Content of the Curriculum and the Aims and Functions of Schooling\n3.1 The Content of the Curriculum and the Aims and Functions of Schooling\n\nThe issue of what should be taught to students at all levels of\neducation\u2014the issue of curriculum content\u2014obviously is a\nfundamental one, and it is an extraordinarily difficult one with which\nto grapple. In tackling it, care needs to be taken to distinguish\nbetween education and schooling\u2014for although education can occur\nin schools, so can mis-education, and many other things can take place\nthere that are educationally orthogonal (such as the provision of free\nor subsidized lunches and the development of social networks); and it\nalso must be recognized that education can occur in the home, in\nlibraries and museums, in churches and clubs, in solitary interaction\nwith the public media, and the like.\n\nIn developing a curriculum (whether in a specific subject area, or\nmore broadly as the whole range of offerings in an educational\ninstitution or system), a number of difficult decisions need to be\nmade. Issues such as the proper ordering or sequencing of topics in\nthe chosen subject, the time to be allocated to each topic, the lab\nwork or excursions or projects that are appropriate for particular\ntopics, can all be regarded as technical issues best resolved either\nby educationists who have a depth of experience with the target age\ngroup or by experts in the psychology of learning and the like. But\nthere are deeper issues, ones concerning the validity of the\njustifications that have been given for including/excluding particular\nsubjects or topics in the offerings of formal educational\ninstitutions. (Why should evolution or creation \u201cscience\u201d\nbe included, or excluded, as a topic within the standard high school\nsubject Biology? Is the justification that is given for teaching\nEconomics in some schools coherent and convincing? Do the\njustifications for including/excluding materials on birth control,\npatriotism, the Holocaust or wartime atrocities in the curriculum in\nsome school districts stand up to critical scrutiny?)\n\nThe different justifications for particular items of curriculum\ncontent that have been put forward by philosophers and others since\nPlato\u2019s pioneering efforts all draw, explicitly or implicitly,\nupon the positions that the respective theorists hold about at least\nthree sets of issues.\n\nFirst, what are the aims and/or functions of education (aims and\nfunctions are not necessarily the same)? Many aims have been proposed;\na short list includes the production of knowledge and knowledgeable\nstudents, the fostering of curiosity and inquisitiveness, the\nenhancement of understanding, the enlargement of the imagination, the\ncivilizing of students, the fostering of rationality and/or autonomy,\nand the development in students of care, concern and associated\ndispositions and attitudes (see Siegel 2007 for a longer list). The\njustifications offered for all such aims have been controversial, and\nalternative justifications of a single proposed aim can provoke\nphilosophical controversy. Consider the aim of autonomy. Aristotle\nasked, what constitutes the good life and/or human flourishing, such\nthat education should foster these (Curren 2013)? These two\nformulations are related, for it is arguable that our educational\ninstitutions should aim to equip individuals to pursue this good\nlife\u2014although this is not obvious, both because it is not clear\nthat there is one conception of the good or flourishing life that is\nthe good or flourishing life for everyone, and it is not clear that\nthis is a question that should be settled in advance rather than\ndetermined by students for themselves. Thus, for example, if our view\nof human flourishing includes the capacity to think and act\nautonomously, then the case can be made that educational\ninstitutions\u2014and their curricula\u2014should aim to prepare, or\nhelp to prepare, autonomous individuals. A rival justification of the\naim of autonomy, associated with Kant, champions the educational\nfostering of autonomy not on the basis of its contribution to human\nflourishing, but rather the obligation to treat students with respect\nas persons (Scheffler 1973 [1989]; Siegel 1988). Still others urge the\nfostering of autonomy on the basis of students\u2019 fundamental\ninterests, in ways that draw upon both Aristotelian and Kantian\nconceptual resources (Brighouse 2005, 2009). It is also possible to\nreject the fostering of autonomy as an educational aim (Hand\n2006).\n\nAssuming that the aim can be justified, how students should be helped\nto become autonomous or develop a conception of the good life and\npursue it is of course not immediately obvious, and much philosophical\nink has been spilled on the general question of how best to determine\ncurriculum content. One influential line of argument was developed by\nPaul Hirst, who argued that knowledge is essential for developing and\nthen pursuing a conception of the good life, and because logical\nanalysis shows, he argued, that there are seven basic forms of\nknowledge, the case can be made that the function of the curriculum is\nto introduce students to each of these forms (Hirst 1965; see Phillips\n1987: ch. 11). Another, suggested by Scheffler, is that curriculum\ncontent should be selected so as \u201cto help the learner attain\nmaximum self-sufficiency as economically as possible.\u201d The\nrelevant sorts of economy include those of resources, teacher effort,\nstudent effort, and the generalizability or transfer value of content,\nwhile the self-sufficiency in question includes \n\n\nself-awareness, imaginative weighing of alternative courses of action,\nunderstanding of other people\u2019s choices and ways of life,\ndecisiveness without rigidity, emancipation from stereotyped ways of\nthinking and perceiving\u2026empathy\u2026 intuition, criticism\nand independent judgment. (Scheffler 1973 [1989: 123\u20135]) \n\n\nBoth impose important constraints on the curricular content to be\ntaught.\n\nSecond, is it justifiable to treat the curriculum of an educational\ninstitution as a vehicle for furthering the socio-political interests\nand goals of a dominant group, or any particular group, including\none\u2019s own; and relatedly, is it justifiable to design the\ncurriculum so that it serves as an instrument of control or of social\nengineering? In the closing decades of the twentieth century there\nwere numerous discussions of curriculum theory, particularly from\nMarxist and postmodern perspectives, that offered the sobering\nanalysis that in many educational systems, including those in Western\ndemocracies, the curriculum did indeed reflect and serve the interests\nof powerful cultural elites. What to do about this situation (if it is\nindeed the situation of contemporary educational institutions) is far\nfrom clear and is the focus of much work at the interface of\nphilosophy of education and social/political philosophy, some of which\nis discussed in the next section. A closely related question is this:\nought educational institutions be designed to further pre-determined\nsocial ends, or rather to enable students to competently evaluate all\nsuch ends? Scheffler argued that we should opt for the latter: we must\n\n\n\nsurrender the idea of shaping or molding the mind of the pupil. The\nfunction of education\u2026is rather to liberate the mind,\nstrengthen its critical powers, [and] inform it with knowledge and the\ncapacity for independent inquiry. (Scheffler 1973 [1989: 139])\n\n\nThird, should educational programs at the elementary and secondary\nlevels be made up of a number of disparate offerings, so that\nindividuals with different interests and abilities and affinities for\nlearning can pursue curricula that are suitable? Or should every\nstudent pursue the same curriculum as far as each is able?\u2014a\ncurriculum, it should be noted, that in past cases nearly always was\nbased on the needs or interests of those students who were\nacademically inclined or were destined for elite social roles.\nMortimer Adler and others in the late twentieth century sometimes used\nthe aphorism \u201cthe best education for the best is the best\neducation for all.\u201d\n\nThe thinking here can be explicated in terms of the analogy of an\nout-of-control virulent disease, for which there is only one type of\nmedicine available; taking a large dose of this medicine is extremely\nbeneficial, and the hope is that taking only a little\u2014while less\neffective\u2014is better than taking none at all. Medically, this is\ndubious, while the educational version\u2014forcing students to work,\nuntil they exit the system, on topics that do not interest them and\nfor which they have no facility or motivation\u2014has even less\nmerit. (For a critique of Adler and his Paideia Proposal, see\nNoddings 2015.) It is interesting to compare the modern \u201cone\ncurriculum track for all\u201d position with Plato\u2019s system\noutlined in the Republic, according to which all\nstudents\u2014and importantly this included girls\u2014set out on\nthe same course of study. Over time, as they moved up the educational\nladder it would become obvious that some had reached the limit imposed\nupon them by nature, and they would be directed off into appropriate\nsocial roles in which they would find fulfillment, for their abilities\nwould match the demands of these roles. Those who continued on with\ntheir education would eventually become members of the ruling class of\nGuardians.\n",
