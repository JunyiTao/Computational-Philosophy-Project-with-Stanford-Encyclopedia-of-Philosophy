    "main_text": "New approaches to ability || The \u2018new dispositionalism\u2019\n5.1 The \u2018new dispositionalism\u2019\n\nIn recent years several authors have revisited the thought that we may\ngive a broadly hypothetical account of ability, without endorsing the\nproblematic claim (CA). This is the view of ability that has been\ndefended by Smith (2003), Vihvelin (2004, 2013), and Fara\n(2008). Following Clarke (2009), we may label this view the\n\u2018new dispositionalism.\u2019\n\nWhat unifies the new dispositionalists is that they return to the\nconditional analysis of ability in light of two thoughts. The first\nthought is one already noted: that there is a variety of power,\ndispositions, that is similar in many respects to abilities. The\nsecond thought is that there are well-known problems of giving a\nconditional analysis of dispositions, in light of which many\nauthors have been inclined to reject the long-assumed link between\ndispositions and conditionals. Taken together, these thoughts yield a\npromising new line on abilities: that though we ought to reject the\nconditional analysis of abilities, we may yet defend a\ndispositional account of abilities.\n\nWhy ought we reject the conditional analysis of dispositions? Consider\nthe following analysis of the disposition to break when struck:\n\n(CD) x is disposed to break when struck iff S would\nbreak if S were struck.\n\n\nDespite the intuitive appeal of (CD), there appear to be at least two\nkinds of counterexamples to it. First, consider a crystal glass that,\nif it were about to be struck, would transform into steel. This glass\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\nbreak if struck\u2014the transformation renders this false. This is a\ncase of finking, in the language of Martin 1994. Second,\nconsider a crystal glass stuffed with styrofoam packaging. This glass\nis disposed to break when struck, but it is not true that it would\nbreak if struck\u2014the packaging prevents this. This is a case of\nmasking, in the language of Johnston 1992. In light of such\ncases, it seems we ought to reject (CD).\n\nThe bearing of these points on our earlier discussion of the\nconditional analysis is the following. There appear to be quite\ngeneral problems for giving a conditional analysis of powers.\nSo it may be that the failures of the conditional analysis of ability\nwere not due to any fact about abilities, but rather to a shortcoming\nof conditional analyses generally. One way of overcoming this problem,\nif this diagnosis is correct, is to analyze abilities directly in\nterms of dispositions.\n\nSuch an analysis is proposed by Fara 2008, who argues:\n\nS has the ability to A in circumstances C\niff she has the disposition to A when, in circumstances\nC, she tries to A. (Fara 2008, 848)\n\n\nThe similarity of this analysis to the hypothetical analyses canvassed\nearlier are clear. This raises several immediate questions, such as\nwhether this analysis can overcome the problem of sufficiency that\nplagued those approaches (see Fara 2008, 851\u2013852 for an\naffirmative answer, and Clarke 2009, 334\u2013336 for some doubts).\nWhat is most striking about the new dispositionalists, however, is how\nthey bring this sort of account of ability to bear on certain familiar\ncases.\n\nConsider how the new dispositionalism bears on so-called\n\u2018Frankfurt cases.\u2019\u00a0These are cases due to Frankfurt\n1969, where an agent chooses to and performs some action A\nwhile at the same time there is some other action B such\nthat, had the agent been about to choose B, an\n\u2018intervener\u2019 would have altered the agent\u2019s brain so\nthat the agent would have chosen, and performed, A instead.\nOne question about such cases is whether the agent, in the actual\nsequence of events, had the ability to B. Frankfurt\u2019s\nintuition, and that of most others, is that she did not. Given the\nfurther claim that the agent is nonetheless morally responsible for\ndoing A, this case appears to be a counterexample to the what\nFrankfurt calls the Principle of Alternative Possibilities (PAP): an\nagent is morally responsible for Aing only if she had the\nability to perform some action other than A.\n\nThe new dispositionalists disagree. Let us focus on Fara\u2019s\ndiagnosis of the case. The question of whether the agent had the\nability to B turns, for Fara, on the question of whether she\nwas disposed to B when she tried to B. Fara\nclaims\u00a0that she does have such a disposition. The\npresence of the intervener is, on Fara\u2019s view, like the\naforementioned styrofoam packaging in a crystal glass. It\nmasks the disposition of the glass to break when struck, but\ndoes not remove that disposition. Similarly, Fara argues, the\npresence of the intervener masks the agent\u2019s disposition\nto B when she tries to B, but does not\nremove that disposition. (There is some disagreement among\nthe new dispositionalists about whether this is a case of finking or\nmasking; see Clarke 2009, 340 for discussion). So, pace\nFrankfurt, the agent does have the ability to B after all.\nAnd so we have, in this case at least, no counterexample to PAP.\n\nA natural worry at this point is that the new dispositionalist has\nsimply changed the subject. For it seems clear that,\u00a0in\na perfectly ordinary sense of ability, Frankfurt\u2019s agent\nlacks the ability to do otherwise. An account of ability\nwhich denies this seems to be speaking of some other concept\naltogether. One way of bringing out what is missing is the idea that\nthere seems to be a connection between my abilities, in the sense of\nability that is relevant to free will, and what is up to me.\nClarke claims\u00a0that this sort of connection fails on the new\ndispositionalist view of ability:\n\nAlthough the presence of a fink or mask that would prevent one\u2019s\nAing is compatible with having a general capacity (the\nunimpaired competence to A), there is an ordinary sense in\nwhich in such circumstances an agent might well be unable to\nA \u2026 If there is something in place that would prevent\nme from Aing should I try to A, if it is not up to\nme that it would so prevent me, and if it is not up to me that such a\nthing is in place, then even if I have a capacity to A, it is\nnot up to me whether I exercise that capacity. (Clarke 2009, 339)\n\n\nThus the objection is that, while the new dispositionalist has perhaps\noffered a theory of something, it is not a theory of\nability.\n\nHow should the new dispositionalist respond? One thought is that we\nare here again encountering the distinction between general and\nspecific abilities. The new dispositionalist might contend that, while\nthe agent in a Frankfurt case may lack the specific ability to do\notherwise, she has the general ability to do otherwise, and that it is\nthis general ability of which the new dispositionalist is giving an\naccount.\n\nThis response, however, postpones a crucial and much broader question.\nThe question is this: should \u2018ability\u2019 in (PAP) be\nunderstood as general ability, or specific ability? If general ability\nis what matters, then Frankfurt cases may indeed not tell against\n(PAP), for the agent retains the general ability to do otherwise. If\nit is specific ability that matters, however,\u00a0the challenge to\n(PAP) stands (see also Whittle 2010). This is a vital question for\nunderstanding the purported connection between agents\u2019 abilities\nand questions of moral responsibility, whatever our verdict on new\ndispositionalism itself. (See Cyr and Swenson 2019\u00a0for a helpful\nrecent discussion of these issues).\n",
