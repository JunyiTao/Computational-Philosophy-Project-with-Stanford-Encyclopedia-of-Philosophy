    "main_text": "Two Philosophical Questions || No Whole Number of Centres of Consciousness\n6.1 No Whole Number of Centres of Consciousness\n\nThe first is a claim that in brain bisection patients, there is no\nwhole number of persons. So far, we have talked as though in brain\nbisection we always end up with some clear number of instances of\nunified consciousness. Nagel (1971), one of the early philosophers to\nwrite about these cases, rejects that view. For him, there is no whole\nnumber of \u2018centres of consciousness\u2019 in brain bisection\npatients: there is too much unity (for example in life outside the\nlaboratory and even in behaviour within) to say \u201ctwo\u201d, yet\ntoo much separation in the specially contrived laboratory situations\nto say \u201cone\u201d. \n\nNot being happy with so counterintuitive a result, philosophers have\nresponded. A response favoured by many is this. For any\nprecise \u2018one or two?\u2019 question, there will be a\nprecise answer. Behavioural control system? One. Groups of experienced\nobjects unified in consciousness? Two. And so on. If so, while the\none\u2019s and the two\u2019s wouldn\u2019t line up as tidily as\nthey do most of the time in people who have not had this operation, it\nis not obvious that the mixed answers support Nagel\u2019s conclusion\nthat there may be no whole number of centres of consciousness in these\npatients.\n",
