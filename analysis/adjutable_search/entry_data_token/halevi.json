Over the course of some\nfifty years, from the end of the 11th century to the middle\nof the 12th, he wrote nearly 800 poems, both secular and\nreligious. However, because this was a time of intensifying religious\nconflict characterized by physical, social, and political upheaval,\nHalevi also sought to develop a reasoned defense of the Jewish\nreligion, which was then under attack on all fronts. Christians and\nMuslims dismissed Judaism as a superseded religion and reviled its\nadherents as guilty of both blindness and faithlessness. Those more\ninclined to philosophy, inside as well as outside the Jewish faith,\nfound many more points to contest. For some, these included even the\nmost fundamental teachings of Judaism, such as God's creation of the\nworld and his involvement in the affairs of mere flesh and blood,\nwhich they regarded as perplexing, at best, or incredible\naltogether.\n\n\nAs a young man, Halevi had studied philosophy, and he continued to\nfollow its evolution in Spain as newer Aristotelian ideas began to\ncirculate among the courtier classes. However, his reactions to what\nhe learned were decidedly mixed. As a trained physician, he certainly\nappreciated the high premium that the philosophers placed on careful\nobservation and clear thinking. Lives were saved thanks to such skills\nor lost when they were lacking. He also admired the philosophers'\nachievements in the formal disciplines of logic and mathematics,\ninasmuch as they came as close to generating certainty as anyone could\nhave hoped. Yet this achievement was also part of a larger\nproblem. Halevi knew that since its inception philosophy had made the\npursuit of truth in every domain its highest goal.  It persistently\nsought to distinguish between opinion and knowledge in order to\nreplace opinions about all things with knowledge of all things. To the\nextent that this project could succeed, those able to acquire such\nknowledge, whether theoretical or practical, would presumably be of\none mind about the truth they came to know and also live their lives\nin accordance with it. However, Halevi also came to realize that well\nbefore the goal is ever reached, opinions, conventions, and traditions\nof all kinds as well as the practices associated with them, would be\nrendered questionable or otherwise suspect, because they were not\nknown philosophically to be true or right. A\nconsequence of this demotion in status of everything unproved was that\nthose best equipped intellectually to examine and judge such matters\ncould, and often did, believe, or allow others to believe, that they\nhad the requisite knowledge of exactly what others lacked by virtue of\ntheir mastery of logic, theory, and other intellectual\nskills. Whether, in fact, lovers of wisdom were also as wise as many\nof them or their proponents claimed seemed far from obvious to\nHalevi. But how could he even discuss such abstract issues in a work\nintended to vindicate the Jewish faith in a time of crisis? How,\nindeed, was he to give a reasoned account and defense of Judaism to\nhis increasingly dispirited or doubting co-religionists, when the\nchallenges came from so many different directions? Their detractors\nhad the prestige of power, numbers, worldly success, and specialized\nnew knowledge to support their claims, while the Jews had only their\nhistory, traditions, and what remained of their faith to fall back\nupon.\n\n\nUltimately, Halevi opted for a novel, yet entirely appropriate,\nsolution. He let a widely-attested fact of recent history make the\ncase for him\u2014the conversion of the Khazar kingdom to Judaism\nalmost four centuries earlier. The story was well known, even if less\nstirring than it was when it first circulated in Spain.  Obviously,\nthe Khazar king and his people had other, more influential, religious\nalternatives to choose from, but they chose Judaism nonetheless\nbecause of a truth that they saw as unique to it.  Surely, the king\nmust have discussed all this; and if he did, so could\nHalevi\u2014within the framework of a dialogue. Indeed, such an\napproach would allow him to examine all of the relevant issues in the\ncourse of an on-going series of conversations, just as they are so\noften encountered and discussed in real life. What is more, the real\nexperiences of the past, now presented with the help of all his poetic\ngifts, could be drawn upon to refute the calumnies and answer the\nobjections raised in the present. Through this connection with an\nevent in history, Halevi's Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf\nof the Despised Religion came to be known more simply as the\nKuzari. Under that title, his book would also become the\nemblematic expression of the lived truths of his people and their\nfaith as these were experienced throughout their history, and, not\nsurprisingly, one of the most beloved works of the Jewish intellectual\nheritage.\n", "toc": [{"#Lif": "1.

Life\n\n\nJudah Halevi (c. 1075\u20131141) was one of the most gifted Hebrew\npoets and talented philosophical theologians of medieval Spain. He was\nborn to an enlightened family of means living in Tudela, a town in\nnortheastern Spain under Muslim rule. He received a comprehensive\neducation in both Hebrew and Arabic sources, encompassing the Bible,\nrabbinic literature, grammar, Arabic and Hebrew poetry, philosophy,\ntheology, and medicine.  As a youth, he traveled to southern Spain\n(al-Andalus) and was quickly recognized for his poetic ability after\nwinning a contest in Cordova in which entrants were asked to write a\npoem matching the complex style of a composition by the famed Moses\nibn Ezra. The renowned poet befriended the young man and brought him\nto Granada where he was welcomed into courtier circles, enjoyed ibn\nEzra's patronage, and composed numerous poems on mainly secular themes\nover several years.\n\n\nThis period of stability, discovery, and high culture was disrupted by\nthe invasion of the Almoravids, a fanatical Islamic sect from North\nAfrica, in 1090. After taking control of the petty kingdoms of\nal-Andalus, in response to the fall of Toledo to the Christian armies\nof Alphonso VI, Jewish life in Granada and beyond began to deteriorate\nrapidly. Halevi left Granada in search of a more secure situation and\neventually settled in Toledo, where his reputation as both a poet and\nphysician preceded him. He was again received with honor and admiration\nby the courtier Jews of the city, but he now supported himself as a\ncourt physician. Nevertheless, clashes been Muslims and Christians, and\ndistrust of Jews on both sides of the divide, caused Halevi increasing\ndismay over how fragile Jewish life in Spain had become. His secular\npoetry reflects these developments in its numerous references to loss,\ngrief, and dislocation. As he puts it in one of his poems,\n\n\nBetween the armies of Seir [the Christians] and Kedar [the Muslims]\nMy army perishes and is lost \u2026\nWhen they fight their wars\nWe fall with their fall \u2026\n\n\nNot long after 1108, the year his patron in Toledo, Solomon ibn\nFerruziel, was murdered, Halevi began to move from city to city. He\ntraveled in the company of his close friend and younger colleague,\nAbraham ibn Ezra, the grammarian, biblical exegete, and Neo-Platonic\nphilosopher. As his fame spread, Halevi enlarged his circle of\nfriendships and contacts as far as North Africa and Egypt. One of\nthese, Abu Said Halfon Ha-Levi of Damietta, a distinguished Jewish\nmerchant with whom Halevi corresponded and finally met in person in\n1127, became an especially trusted friend and partner in efforts to\nransom Jewish captives. He would later become Halevi's host in\nEgypt.\n\n\nBy this time, Halevi was at the height of his career in Spain. He had\nby then married and had a daughter, who would be married to Isaac ibn\nEzra, the son of his friend Abraham. His secular and religious poetry\nmade him a celebrated figure throughout Spain and beyond. He had also\nwritten the first drafts of what he called the \u201cKhazari\nbook,\u201d which was undertaken in response to questions raised by\nan unnamed heretical thinker, possibly a Karaite. It would eventually\nbe reworked to become his most famous religio-philosophical work, the\nKuzari or Book of Refutation and Proof on Behalf of the\nDespised Religion.  However, he had gradually become convinced\nthat a secure Jewish life in Spain was no longer viable and certainly\nnot for him. His religious poetry increasingly attested to an intense\nlonging for communion with God and also for a return to Zion. As the\nChristian policy of reconquering territories lost to the Muslims\nproceeded apace, and in the wake of the First Crusade, messianic\nexpectations grew. He even records in one of his poems a prophetic\ndream that forecast the downfall of the oppressive Islamic regimes in\nthe year 1130.\n\n\nIt is likely that the failure of the redemption to come as predicted\nonly strengthened his resolve to perform a redeeming act of his own,\nnamely, to emigrate to the Land of Israel and devote himself entirely\nto the religious life he describes in his writings. In the late summer\nof 1140, he departed for Egypt, accompanied by his son-in-law, Isaac.\nHis correspondence and poetry attest that he remained there until\nmid-May of 1141, despite attempts to set sail for the Holy Land\nearlier. It is possible that he arrived in Ashkalon by the end of May,\nand many scholars support this view. However, no documentary evidence\nconfirms this. A letter from his friend Halfon confirms only that Judah\nHalevi died in July of 1141.\n2. The Frame Story of the Kuzari and Its Setting\n\n\nHalevi introduces the dialogue by assuming the voice of an\nanonymous narrator. This figure identifies the overall concern of the\nensuing discussions by indicating that he had been asked about whatever\nargumentation he had against those who differ or take issue with the\nJews, naming as examples the philosophers generally, the adherents of\nthe other major religions of the time (Christianity and Islam), and\nthose who have seceded from the great majority of Jews because of their\ndifferences with them. Among the latter, it is likely that the Karaites\nwere foremost in his mind. The narrator then establishes the context of\nthe dialogue by recalling what he had heard of the arguments used by a\nJewish sage approximately four hundred years earlier that persuaded the\nking of the Khazars to adopt the Jewish religion based on testimony\nrecorded in historical chronicles of the time. This recollection leads\ndirectly to the frame story on which all that follows is\npredicated.\n\nAccording to this story, the king repeatedly dreams the same dream, in\nwhich an angel appears to address him saying, \u201cYour intention is\npleasing to God, but your actions are not pleasing\u201d (K 1:1).\nNotwithstanding the king's efforts to respond to its message through\ndiligence in presiding over the established forms of Khazar worship\nand his sincere intent in doing so, the dream continued to come with\nthe same disturbing message. This unexpected result eventually\nprompted him to examine the various religions and sects; after doing\nso, both he and the majority of the Khazars converted to Judaism. At\nthis point, the narrator observes that some of the arguments\nof the unnamed Jewish scholar that prompted the king to convert were\nalso persuasive to him and in accord with his own belief. Indeed, he\nthought he should record this argumentation \u201cjust as it took\nplace,\u201d adding, \u201cThe intelligent will understand,\u201d a\nbiblical citation from Daniel 12:10 (K 1:1).\n\n\nThis remark, \u201cThe intelligent will understand,\u201d can be\ninterpreted in various ways. According to some, it indicates that the\nargumentation presented in the dialogue must have been taken from the\nBook of Histories, which the narrator also mentioned.\nOthers, however, maintain that it hints at the entire dialogue being a\nliterary fiction. Still, others have suggested that it points to the\nfact that the dialogue may have been intended for very different kinds\nof readers and thus written on at least two levels. According to this\nlast interpretation, the Kuzari is addressed on one level to\nthe multitude of Jews in order to reinforce both their traditional\nopinions and their adherence to the forms of religious observance\nestablished by the Talmudic sages.  However, on a second level, it is\naddressed to those more inclined towards exercising independent\njudgment in the conduct of life, such as members of the courtier\nclass, philosophers, and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, with a\nview to providing instruction on how to live responsibly within their\nown community. These interpretations are by no means exhaustive, but\ncollectively they suggest that Halevi's intentions should not be taken\nas transparently obvious either in the dialogue as a whole or even in\nspecific exchanges between its interlocutors. Not even the narrator,\nwho comes closest to speaking for Halevi himself, admits to being\npersuaded by all of the Jewish sage's arguments.  Accordingly, the\nintelligent reader is expected to follow the arguments and actions of\nthe dialogue with a view to analyzing and identifying the spoken and\nunspoken assumptions of each speaker, the function of metaphors,\nanalogies, and even oaths, the types and relative cogency of the\narguments presented, and the significance of reformulations of earlier\nstatements by the same speaker, if he or she is to understand what is\nrecorded and how it might ultimately change one's life.\n\n\nWith this in mind, it is helpful to consider briefly what Halevi\ndiscloses about the Khazar king himself as the \u201coriginal\u201d\naddressee of the arguments presented. As a reigning monarch, he is,\nabove all, a man of action who is naturally concerned with correct\nactions in all of the many areas in which such judgments are made. His\nprincipal responsibility is to govern his people so that they will\nsurvive and surmount any threats to their existence\u2014internal or\nexternal\u2014and ultimately prosper in the long run. Insofar as he\nalso has priestly responsibilities, he is also concerned with pious\nactions. Yet as a pious pagan, he stands outside and apart from the\nthree revealed religions. This might qualify him as a detached and\nimpartial judge of what they have to teach, but it also suggests that\nhe is disposed to be skeptical about their claims to possess a\nrevelation from God. Beyond this, he is inclined to disdain Jews\nbecause of their despised condition and lowly estate. In general, he\nplaces a high premium on what can be learned from experience and\nproves himself ready to act upon what he learns.  However, to the\nextent that his openness to experience also includes religious\nexperience, he emerges as a divided man whose natural piety is at odds\nwith his skeptical inclinations.\n3. The Introductory Exchanges\n\n\nThe dialogue proper begins to unfold only after the king, upon\nrealizing in his dream that he must try to find out what actions are\ntruly pleasing to God, turns to a philosopher and asks him about his\nbeliefs. Why he seeks out the philosopher first and focuses\nspecifically on his beliefs as opposed to his knowledge or his actions\nis not explained, although it is plausible to suppose that the nature\nof the king's invitation to his various interlocutors indicates in\nadvance what he expects to hear from each one and perhaps also what he\ndoes not expect to hear. In any case, the unnamed philosopher provides\nwhat is generally acknowledged to be both a masterful and concise\nexposition of the Neoplatonic-Aristotelian world-view that dominated\nso much of medieval intellectual life from the 10th century on. While\nmost of the claims put forward were common to all medieval\nAristotelians, three ideas in particular suggest the influence of\nHalevi's contemporary, Ibn Bajjah (d. 1138), the foremost Aristotelian\nof his generation in Spain. These ideas are that union with the Active\nIntellect is possible during one's lifetime, that such union implies\ncognitive identity with other thinkers who know the truth, and that a\nphilosopher's life is essentially a solitary regimen.\n\n\nThe philosopher opens his presentation with a sharply negative\nappraisal of the presuppositions underlying the king's dream and\noffers a brief critical analysis to explain why he rejects each\none. Specifically, he denies that God is the kind of being who is\neither pleased or displeased about anything, has knowledge of\nparticular persons, actions, or events, or even can be regarded as the\n\u201cCreator\u201d of human beings, unless one understands this in\npurely metaphorical terms. What warrants these confident denials is\nthe philosopher's conception of a perfect being and how this\nshapes his understanding of divinity. Thus, a God who is capable of\nbeing pleased and displeased must have various aims and desires, all\nof which signify privation of that which is aimed at or desired, until\nit is provided. However, any being who is subject to privation and\nlack could hardly be considered perfect or divine. It would constantly\nbe in a deficient state and also dependent on others to provide\nwhatever is desired. Thus, Divinity as a perfect being is simply\nincompatible with having or experiencing privation. Accordingly, God,\nin contrast to all that is non-divine, is entirely beyond having\ndesires and aims because he lacks no perfection worthy of the\nname.\n\n\nSimilarly, God could hardly be the kind of being who knows\nparticular people, actions, intentions, or events, since these things\nchange with the passage of time. Were God to have knowledge of mutable\nthings, he, too, would be ever changing and always in need of being\ninformed of each new development. Far from being the exemplar of\nperfect being and knowledge, lacking nothing worth knowing, the God of\nthe Khazar king's dream turns out to be at all times the most\nepistemically needful and mutable of beings. This outcome also explains\nwhy God cannot be conceived in any literal sense as the Creator of the\nuniverse or humankind through some act of will meant to realize a\ndivine intention. For even if one were to assume that God's\nintention had always been to create the world at a particular time,\nt, and that this remained as true at\nt + 1 as it was\nat t \u2013 1, God would\nhave had to will the\nappropriate change at time t\nor to have performed some act resulting in the world's\ncreation at that time, lest there be no grounds whatsoever for claiming\nthat God actually caused the world to exist. However, once God is\nunderstood to be capable of changing in accordance with an intention,\nvolition, action, or relation, so as to become the Creator of the\nuniverse, it becomes problematic to think of God as a perfect being.\nOnce again, the suggestion that God changes by exercising his will in\ndifferent ways at different times also suggests that there is privation\nor potentiality within God, both before the act of creation, when\nGod's intention was as yet unrealized, and even more so\nafterwards, because of all the new and variable relationships\nestablished with the creation of the world. For these and similar\nreasons, the philosopher concludes that God is better conceived of as\nthe cause of all causes involved in the creation of every created\nthing, not through any intention or aim, but rather through an eternal\nand essentially changeless process of emanation.\n\n\nAt this point, the philosopher turns his attention away from\nan analysis and critique of the king's theological assumptions to\na systematic, topical exposition of his own largely\nNeoplatonic-Aristotelian views on cosmology and the prerequisites for\nhuman flourishing in the world as it is. Thus, he confidently maintains\nthat God did not create man at all because the world is eternal, and\nhuman beings have never ceased coming into being from those who\npreceded them. The universe itself turns out to be a complex system of\ninteracting causes and effects, which are necessarily connected to one\nanother on various levels. Human beings, naturally enough, are\nconstituted by and within this complex whole and combine within\nthemselves diverse forms, dispositions, character traits, and qualities\nthat reflect essentially three kinds of influences. These are, first,\ninfluences associated with one's parents and relatives, although\nwe are not told whether these are primarily biological or psychological\nin nature; second, those associated with environmental conditions, both\nproximate and remote, such as air, climate, geographic location, types\nof food and water, as well as the movements of celestial bodies; third\nand finally, those associated with education and training, which\nrealize and perfect each person's particular potentialities as\nfully as possible in order to complete an individual's\ndevelopment. Inevitably, these influences give rise to a wide array of\nindividuals, with diverse aptitudes, perfections, and deficiencies in\nvarious combinations and proportions. Together, they constitute the\nentire human species, ranging from the most perfect and least deficient\nto the exact opposite.\n\nThe philosopher, it turns out, is the one human type provided with all\nof the dispositions needed to actualize the natural, moral,\nintellectual, and practical virtues that bring about human flourishing\nin the fullest sense. Thus, he alone is said to lack nothing pertaining\nto perfection. What human perfection and flourishing ultimately consist\nof is a state of intellectual illumination by the Active Intellect, in\nwhich the passive or material intellect of the perfect individual\nperceives itself as reaching the level of attachment to, and, indeed,\nunion with its light. The Active Intellect belongs to the divine\nhierarchy. More specifically, it is the tenth and lowest of the\nincorporeal Intelligences in the philosopher's cosmology, which\npresides over the sub-lunar sphere and all it contains. Insofar as this\nIntellect comprehends the forms of everything that exists or occurs\nwithin our world, it is also capable of communicating what it knows,\neither partially or completely, in the form of intellectual\nilluminations (the aforementioned \u201clight\u201d) to any\nindividual whose material intellect is suitably prepared to receive it.\nHere, knowing follows the Aristotelian paradigm of becoming one with\nthe thing known, albeit in an immaterial way. Attachment to or union\nwith the Active Intellect thereby contributes to human perfection and\nflourishing by first providing the individual with the pleasures of\ndiscovery and genuine intellectual understanding and, second,\ninfluencing the subsequent activities of the individual in practical\nmatters so completely that his limbs perform only the most perfect\nactions, at the most appropriate times, in accordance with the best\nconditions, \u201cas if they were the organs of the Active Intellect\nitself.\u201d Broadly speaking, the attainment of intellectual union\nis presented as culminating in a life of rational self-sufficiency in\nwhich one always recognizes what the most rational course of action is\nand acts accordingly.\n\nThe philosopher comes closest to addressing the Khazar king's\nspecific concern with actions pleasing to God or pleasing in\nthemselves, when he outlines what is required in order to reach this\nlevel. Thus, the soul must be purified of doubts and acquire knowledge\nof the universals belonging to the sciences as they really are. It must\nalso keep to the way of justice regarding both character traits and\nactions, for these activities help the soul in conceiving of what is\ntrue and persevering in its inquiries. When these prerequisites are\nfulfilled, it will come to be like an angel, presumably, in the sense\nof actively and continuously contemplating the true realities of what\nit understands. Among the other consequences associated with this way\nof life, the philosopher indicates that the soul ceases to fear bodily\nextinction, but delights in life instead. It does this, in part,\nbecause it joins and becomes one with great thinkers ranging from the\nsemi-divine Hermes Trismegistus and Aesculapius to Socrates, Plato, and\nAristotle, suggesting, at the very least, that those who genuinely know\nthe truth are of one mind regarding it. Consequently, if anything\nsymbolizes \u201cGod's being pleased,\u201d it is just such\nunion with the Active Intellect. Furthermore, the shift from passivity\nto activity in conceiving the true realities also generates\ncontentment, modesty, and submissiveness along with every other\ndesirable character trait, including reverence for the First Cause.\nHowever, this reverence has nothing to do with hoping for its favor or\nbeing spared its wrath; the philosopher lives beyond such hopes and\nfears. Rather, philosophic reverence arises because it prompts one to\nimitate the Active Intellect by preferring truth to falsehood with the\nresult that one always accepts the truth and describes it in a fitting\nway. In effect, one reveres the First Cause because it is\nuseful.\n\nThe question of identifying specific acts through which one's\nreverence might be expressed is ultimately a matter of indifference to\nthe philosopher. Thus, he advises the king not to be concerned about\nwhich \u201cdivine Law\u201d to follow and what language, speech, or\nactions to employ in worship. If something is nevertheless deemed\nnecessary in order to cultivate the appropriate character traits or,\nbeyond that, to govern oneself and others, then the king should simply\ncreate his own religion or adopt one of the intellectual\nnomoi already composed by the philosophers to\nserve as his religion. Still, all of this is peripheral to the\nprincipal task, that of purifying one's soul of doubts, errors,\nmisunderstandings, and other defects after acquiring genuine knowledge\nof the universals belonging to the sciences, for this alone facilitates\nattachment to the Active Intellect. Once this occurs, if indeed it\ndoes, the philosopher allows that\nperhaps the Active Intellect will\nprovide the king, at some future time, with knowledge of hidden matters\nand even commands conveyed through veridical dreams and apposite\nimagery. Notwithstanding this tentatively encouraging observation, the\nphilosopher seems to conclude his exposition very much as he began it,\nby casting doubt upon the credibility of the king's dream,\ninasmuch as the king has obviously not reached this level, even while\noutlining with utmost brevity what a philosophic theory of prophetic\ndreams might look like.\n\nIn subsequent exchanges between the Khazar king and his interlocutors,\nHalevi goes on to furnish important additional information about both\nthe speakers themselves and also about the principles, themes, and\ncriteria of judgment that will be invoked to advance the dialogue and\nto evaluate the views and justifications offered to support them. This\napplies especially to his depiction of the king. Accordingly, the king\nresponds to the philosopher's speech by acknowledging that he\nfound it persuasive, but then immediately qualifies this by adding that\nit was nonetheless unresponsive to his request for practical guidance.\nThis divided response confirms from the outset that the king is himself\na divided man, someone open to and impressed by philosophy, but at the\nsame time open and plainly responsive to the claims of religion and\nparticularly claims regarding the importance of correct action. As the\ndialogue unfolds, therefore, he will often draw upon the\nphilosopher's skeptical stance or the various ideas introduced by\nhim in responding to other speakers in different contexts. However, the\nimportance he accords to his own experience and that of others\npossessing genuine empirical knowledge will play a decisive role in how\nhe seeks to have his particular concerns addressed and in the decisions\nhe ultimately makes regarding his own beliefs and actions.\n\n\nTo illustrate, he denies the need to purify his soul because\nhe already knows from his dream experience that his soul is pure. After\nall, his intentions were described as pleasing to God, but his actions\nwere not. Surely, then, pure intention is not enough; certain actions\nmust be pleasing in themselves. Moreover, if\nthis consideration is not sufficiently probative, the collective\nexperience of both Christians and Muslims is offered to establish the\npoint. Together, they divide the entire inhabited world among\nthemselves and sincerely direct their intentions towards pleasing God,\neven to the point of killing each other and readily sacrificing\nthemselves in their wars. Yet, however similar they may be in the\npurity of their intentions, their forms of religious praxis are at\nodds. Even more to the point, it is rationally\nimpossible for both Muslims and Christians to be\nright. Whether Halevi's point, here, is to\nemphasize the importance of collective experience through time in\ndeciding matters of correct behavior or to point out instead that the\nphilosopher's general indifference to praxis beyond recommending\nprudent behavior as an aid to philosophical understanding borders on\nrelativism is not clear; his purpose may be either or both. What is\nclear is that the king's rejoinder represents the beginning of a\ncritical appraisal of the philosopher's position that continues\nlong after the philosopher has left the scene.\n\n\nThis becomes clearer still after the philosopher replies\nthat the religion of the philosophers does not allow for killing either\nof the contending parties\u2014surely, a humane consideration that no\nvictim of religious discrimination or persecution, and especially no\nJew, could fail to appreciate. Yet, even though the king evidently\nshares the philosopher's doubts about the religious doctrine of\ncreation in six days and goes on to highlight his own skepticism about\nthe possibility of divine-human contact in connection with it, he\nnevertheless points out a glaring discrepancy between the\nphilosopher's theoretical account of prophecy and its\nprerequisites and actual experience. He notes that given the\nphilosopher's exemplary standards for virtuous behavior,\nknowledge of the sciences, and personal effort, prophecy should have\nbeen well known and widespread among them. They should also have had a\nreputation for performing wondrous feats. However, the facts show that\nthis is not the case. On the contrary, veridical or prophetic dreams do\ncome at times to people who are unconcerned with the sciences and\npurifying their souls, and they do not come to those who have\ndeliberately sought such things. From this, the king concludes that the\ndivine order of things (al-\u2019amr\nal-\u2019il\u00e2h\u00ee\n) and the souls of certain human beings have a secret character that\ndiffers from what the philosopher described. This reference to the\ndivine order and to the mysterious character of the souls of those who\nhave prophetic experiences associated with it introduces one of the\ncentral themes of the\nKuzari. While it will ultimately be a\nJewish scholar who explicates and illustrates these notions for the\nking, it is nonetheless significant that the king is the one who first\nmentions them. His doing so raises, at the very least, the possibility\nthat a pious pagan who acknowledges what is hidden or mysterious may\nperceive reality more completely and accurately than an overconfident\nphilosopher who immediately dismisses such things. The king's\nstatement also calls attention to the fact that whatever the divine\norder may signify in subsequent discussions, a pious pagan and\npresumably any others who come to speak of it are familiar with its\nmeaning and general use. In other words, the basic concept is not\nunique to any particular religion.\n\n\nAfter the philosopher departs, the king decides to speak\nwith the Christians and the Muslims on the assumption that one of their\nforms of practice must be pleasing to God, but he declines to speak\nwith the Jews owing to their paltry numbers, despicable condition, and\nthe universal contempt in which they are held. Accordingly, he asks a\nChristian scholar and then a Muslim scholar about his \u201cknowledge\nand actions\u201d (\u2018ilm\nwa-l-\u2018amal), and each replies, in turn,\nwith an affirmation of his faith, a brief history of his religion, and\nat least an adumbration of its practice. In their attempt to address\nthe king's practical concerns, each one also presents his\nreligion as the culmination of a prophetic tradition going back to the\nexperiences of biblical Israel. Nevertheless, the king rejects both\npresentations, in the former case, because its principal claims are\njudged to be at odds with reason, and in the latter, because it fails\nto provide adequate empirical evidence that a revelation actually\noccurred and that its alleged content is itself miraculous. Despite\nthese negative appraisals, both exchanges (K 1:4\u20139) have the positive\neffect of making clear that what the king seeks is a statement of\npraxis supported by incontrovertible evidence that grips the heart\ncompletely. Building upon the paradigm of how natural scientists\nexplain extraordinary phenomena, the king maintains that if direct\nexperience, however unlikely or unexpected, is well founded and grips\nthe heart, it must be accepted. This is because experience is primary\nand foundational, while the task of theory is to show rationally how\nwhat initially seemed unlikely is actually plausible. Ultimately, he\nproposes four criteria for evaluating claims of divine contact with\nflesh and blood. The evidence in favor of a convincing claim must be:\n(1) genuinely miraculous in the sense of describing effects that are\nclearly transformative and beyond human powers to produce; (2)\nwitnessed by multitudes; (3) seen with their own eyes; and (4) capable\nof being studied and examined repeatedly.\n\n\nBecause both his Christian and Muslim interlocutors had\ngrounded their beliefs on God's widely attested revelation to\nancient Israel, the king concludes that he has no alternative but to\nspeak with a Jewish sage and ask about his belief. The sage replies\nwith an affirmation of his faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and\nIsrael, who is described as having miraculously rescued all of the\nchildren of Israel from Egyptian bondage, provided for them in the\nwilderness, given them the Holy Land, and sent Moses with the divine\nLaw. To this, he adds that God subsequently sent thousands of prophets\nto support this Law through their promises and warnings. In addition to\nthe statement's remarkable brevity, it is significant in several\nways. While asked to state his belief\n(i\u2019tiqad) in the sense of opinion or\nreasoned conviction, the Jewish sage replies instead with a profession\nof faith (iman), signifying\ntrust or steadfast reliance, which is typically the result of lived\nexperiences that culminate in special relationships and understandings.\nThe statement is also notable for not basing faith on one momentous\nexperience within a single individual's lifetime, but rather for\nlinking it with a long series of memorable experiences over the\nlifetime of an entire people. Beyond this, the narrative alludes\ndirectly and indirectly to divine contacts with human beings that were\nsupported by public, empirical, and miraculous evidence that could be\nstudied, re-examined, and, in some sense, tested repeatedly. Indeed,\nthe dispatch of thousands of prophets in support of the Law over the\ncenturies suggests that there was a recurrent need for re-studying the\nevidence and testing its import with the passage of time. Finally, the\nstatement is programmatic insofar as it identifies many topics and\nthemes to be addressed later, such as evidence for believing in the\nexistence of God, the relationship between familial ties and experience\nof the divine, prophets and prophecy, revelation and divine Law, the\nHoly Land and its significance, and divine providence, among others.\nThis is probably why the sage concludes his statement by noting that\nthe Jewish faith embraces everything taught in the Torah, \u201cbut\nthe story is long.\u201d (K 1:11)\n\n\nIn the discussion that immediately follows, Halevi puts\nforward the first of a series of distinctions and rejoinders that\ncollectively amount to a broad-ranging critique of the\nphilosopher's statement and even of philosophy as such. Still, as\nwill become clear, his critique is not so comprehensive that it\nprecludes selective appropriation and adaptation of certain\nphilosophical ideas for his own purposes. Thus, the king expresses\nsurprise that the sage said nothing about God's being the Creator\nof the world, who orders and governs it in such a way that people\nstrive to imitate God's wisdom and justice in their own actions.\nTo this, the sage replies that the king is referring to the kind of\nsyllogistic, governmental religion to which speculation leads. In\ncontemporary terms, this would now be called a civil religion designed\nto govern and educate human passions based on practical reason. The\nsage continues by saying that the king is overlooking the fact that\nsuch religions contain many doubtful claims. What is more, he adds, the\nking will find that the philosophers do not agree on any single action\nor belief, and this is contrary to the idealized picture of union and\nunanimity among the great thinkers that is mentioned in the\nphilosopher's speech. To be sure, they make many claims, but only\nsome of these are strictly demonstrable. Others are, at best, merely\nprobable or persuasive, and still others do not even reach that level.\nHere, then, one finds the sage using basic philosophical distinctions\nabout the varying degrees of validity and soundness by which premises\nand syllogisms are classified as either demonstrative, dialectical,\nrhetorical, poetic, or sophistical, to call into question the presumed\nsoundness and certainty of whatever the philosophers have to say. By\ncontrast, however, the sage contends that matters of direct\nobservation, such as those he had described in his opening statement,\nrequire neither proof nor demonstration. They are and ought to be\naccepted as foundational. The king quickly indicates that he regards\nthe sage's critical observations as more likely to be persuasive\nthan his opening statement was, but he requests additional proof. When\ntold that the sage's opening statement was\nthe proof, he is plainly at a loss to understand how that is\npossible. It is with this expression of puzzlement (K 1:16) that the\nintroductory exchanges between the king and his successive\ninterlocutors comes to an end. Clearly, the Jewish sage has not taken\nthe king very far from his skeptical moorings, but he has nevertheless\nsucceeded where his predecessors did not. He has caused the king to\nwonder just how a person as critical and astute as the sage seems to be\ncould regard his extraordinary claims as constituting proof for their\nown veracity. His success, simply stated, was to engage the\nking's latent interest in his reply and, by doing so, to keep\ntheir conversation going.\n4. Grounds for Belief in the Existence of God\n\n\nThe sage proposes to resolve the king's puzzlement by\nmeans of a thought experiment comprised of two hypothetical situations.\nWhile this experiment is ultimately about what counts as sufficient\ngrounds to persuade him of the existence of God as the sage has\ndescribed him, this is neither announced in\nadvance nor immediately obvious from what is said. Accordingly, the\nsage asks the king whether, upon being told that the ruler of India was\na virtuous man and that the people of India also had excellent\ncharacter traits and behaved justly towards one another in all their\ndealings, he would be compelled to revere their ruler and recount his\nexploits with praise. The Khazar king replies that there could hardly\nbe any compelling obligation, if there is doubt about whether the\njustice of India's people was entirely of their own making, and\nthey have no king at all, or whether it really was due to their king,\nafter all, or, finally, whether it was attributable to both. His\nunstated but nonetheless crucial assumption is that, of course, there\nis doubt, because no compelling evidence or argument has been provided\nto establish any of the three alternatives just mentioned.\n\n\nThe second hypothetical case immediately follows. Now the\nking is asked whether he would be obligated to obey the ruler of India,\nif he were to be visited by his messenger, who brought with him gifts\ntypical of India and specifically of its royal palaces, a message\nsigned by the king himself, as well as medicines to cure his illnesses\nand preserve his health, and poisons by which to prevail over his\nenemies. The king's reply is unqualifiedly affirmative, and he\nimmediately explains why. His previous doubt about whether India really\nhad a king would have been dispelled, and he would believe that both\nhis dominion and his order extend to include him. When the sage then\nasks the king how he would then describe the Indian king he has never\nmet, he responds in a way that clearly recalls his earlier remarks\nabout natural scientists confronted by unexplained phenomena. He says\nthat he would describe him, first, in terms of attributes based on\ndirect observation, and then in terms of other attributes that are both\ngenerally accepted and plainly applicable because of those based on\nobservation.\n\n\nIt is only after the king has expressed himself in this way\nthat the sage begins to suggest that the entire thought experiment is\nparabolical and that the king has, in effect, endorsed the rationality\nand appropriateness of the sage's opening remarks. The\nendorsement was in his having responded to the unanticipated diplomatic\nmission to his court with all its concomitant benefits just as the\nbiblical Israelites responded to the unanticipated mission and\nextraordinary benefits that came their way, which by their very nature\nlaid the foundation for a special relationship. By providing additional\nexamples about how God is known to be real only from experience or from\nuninterrupted tradition which is deemed equivalent to it, rather than\nfrom the tenuous and inconclusive arguments associated with\nsyllogistic, governmental religions, both the king and the reader are\nleft to work out the specific correspondences between the two\nhypothetical cases and the claims of philosophy on the one hand, and\nrevealed religion on the other. Even a cursory reading, however,\nestablishes that in both parts of the thought experiment, the king of\nIndia represents God, and India, the divine realm. In the first\nhypothetical case, the justice of India's people seems to\nrepresent either a pervasive, intelligible aspect of the cosmos (e.g.,\nmotion, causation) which serves as the starting point of cosmological\narguments generally, or, more specifically, evidence of intelligent\nordering, on which design arguments are typically based. The possible\nexplanations for the justice that prevails would presumably correspond\nto various philosophical and theological positions that remain to be\nidentified. The key point is that the Khazar king recognizes that there\nis no compelling evidence or argument to establish that the justice of\nIndia's people is due to their king or that they even have a\nking. Hence, he suspends judgment. In the second hypothetical case, it\nis clear that the messenger of the king of India is\neither an angel or a prophet, that the signed letter is most likely the\nrevealed Law, which repeatedly presents God, using his proper name, as\nits author, and that the medicinal gifts are the divine commandments.\nHowever the other elements of the parable might be understood, the key\npoint is that, based on the empirical evidence presented to him, the\nking is not only prepared to acknowledge the existence of the king of\nIndia, but also to recognize the authority of his dominion and obey his\norder. In effect, the diplomatic mission which the second hypothetical\ncase describes creates a sense of indebtedness and obligation on the\npart of the recipient which lays the groundwork for a special\nrelationship, such as that of a suzerain and vassal or patron and\nclient. As the dialogue proceeds, it will be helpful to keep in mind\nboth this brief reference to the Indian king's dominion and order\nas well as the apparently insignificant fact that the king's\nrepresentative comes from India.\n5. The Hierarchy of Being\n\n\nThe Khazar king is soon reminded that while he may have been\nthe beneficiary of the Indian king's largesse in the parable, the\nsage's point was to show that the children of Israel were the\nactual beneficiaries of divine largesse in reality. What is more, he\nhimself senses that their legacy seems to be confined to themselves.\nEven though the sage explains that all who join them will share in\ntheir good fortune, he also qualifies this by noting that they will\nnevertheless not be equal to lineal descendants of Israel, since the\nlatter are \u201cthe choicest of the descendants of Adam.\u201d (K\n1:26\u201327) Despite the king's obvious dismay, he is nonetheless\nsufficiently curious about what lies behind this puzzling claim that he\nagrees to the sage's request to be allowed to broaden his\nexplanation of it.\n\n\nHalevi's task at this juncture is not only to explain\nhow God could have entered into contact with mere flesh and blood to\nprovide instruction about what is pleasing and displeasing to him, but\nalso to explain how only Israel could have\nreceived this instruction. His strategy for explaining both\nsuccessfully is to build upon the king's skepticism regarding\nclaims of direct divine-human contact in order to strengthen his case\nby raising such contacts to a higher level. Accordingly, the sage calls\nthe king's attention to the familiar hierarchical structure of\nthe empirical world, namely, the ascending orders of living beings that\ncan be perceived by the senses\u2014plants, animals, and human beings\nendowed with intellect. He also wins the king's basic assent to\nhis classification of each order\n(amr) or level\n(rutbah) by reference to the\nvarious abilities and/or activities that distinguish the creatures that\nbelong to it. When the king is then asked what level might be above the\nintellectual order, which distinguishes human beings as rational\nanimals from all other animals by virtue of their concern with\nimproving character traits, the household, and the city through\nman-made laws and political institutions, he maintains that there is\nnone higher than that of great savants. To this, the sage counters that\nthey, too, belong to the intellectual order, since they differ from\nother human beings only in degree, not in kind. So he asks about what\nappears to be yet another hypothetical case: If he were to find someone\nwith an utterly extraordinary capacity for surviving amidst\nlife-threatening circumstances as well as amazing self-mastery and\nknowledge of hidden things pertaining to both the past and the future,\nwould this not represent an essentially different level? The king\nresponds that it amounts to even more than that; it would be the divine\nlevel characteristic of God's own kingdom,\nif it exists. In addition, the person\ndescribed would come under the dominion of the divine order\n(al-amr al-ilahi). After the\nking's qualified revision of the hierarchy's true extent,\nit remains only for the sage to explain that what he described were, in\nfact, the attributes of the undisputed prophet through whom multitudes\nof Israelites became aware of God's attachment to them and also\nof the fact that God governs them in accordance with both his will and\ntheir own obedience and disobedience, as recorded in the Bible's\nhistorical and genealogical narratives. (K 1: 31\u201343)\n\n\nIn effect, then, the sage makes use of the king's\ndoubts about God's communicating with ordinary\nhuman beings to persuade him that God might plausibly do so\nwith super-human beings. It\nis not that the prophets, who exemplify the latter category, are not\nflesh and blood, but rather that the qualities which distinguish their\nsouls (recalling the Khazar's concluding remarks to the\nphilosopher in K 1:4) raise them far above that level so as to belong,\nquite literally, to one that is essentially different from and higher\nthan all the others, namely, \u201cthe divine order.\u201d Once this\nis granted, there is no longer any insurmountable barrier between God,\nangels, and human beings of a certain\nkind that would preclude, in principle, contact\nor communication between them, even though their respective powers and\nranks within the same order differ greatly. In this sense, prophets\nbelong to the divine order and speak on its behalf, just as the\nmessenger in the sage's parable comes from India with the\nking's letter and appropriate gifts because he belongs to that\nkingdom and was duly commissioned by its ruler. By the same token,\nhowever, the king's appointed messengers might also be dispatched\nto other members of the kingdom with announcements, instructions,\nreproaches, or other communications for their benefit. Indeed, all of\nthese would be evidence of the king's attachment to them. They,\nin turn, as subjects of the king, could be expected to have access to\nhim, and if they also had all of the requisite qualifications, they\nmight also become messengers, i.e., prophets, themselves. By\nextrapolating thus from the sage's parable, it becomes clear why\nIsrael alone is designated as the choicest of Adam's descendents\nand the recipient of God's instructions. Israel, too, belongs to\nthe divine order or kingdom and comes under God's own\ndominion.\n\n\nIt should be noted, however, that interpretations of exactly\nwhat Halevi meant by the very significant term al-amr\nal-ilahi vary greatly. While there is a general\nconsensus that it signifies experienced aspects of divinity in nature\nand especially in history, explanations and descriptions range from the\nvery abstract (e.g., \u201cthe divine matter,\u201d \u201cthe divine\nthing,\u201d \u201cthe divine,\u201d \u201can aura enveloping the\npeople and land of Israel\u201d) to a wide array of specific instances\nor manifestations (e.g., \u201cGod as such,\u201d \u201cGod's\nwill,\u201d \u201ca super-rational faculty in man for\nprophecy,\u201d \u201cdivine light\u201d). In order to clarify and\norganize the basic connotations of the term in a way that enables us to\nmake sense of all of Halevi's specific usages, it is helpful to\ndistinguish between three distinct yet related connotations originally\nsuggested by Shlomo Pines. He based them on his study of Shiite and\nIsmaili terminology used in the\nKuzari, but they are introduced here\nbecause of their direct correlation with Halevi's clearest uses\nof the term in the first parts of the dialogue.\n\n\nThe first and most basic connotation of al-amr\nal-ilahi signifies an arrangement, dispensation\nor ordering of things which governs the affairs of all who belong to\nand participate in it, such as angels, prophets, and pious friends of\nGod, among others. (K 1: 4, 41\u201343; 3: 5) Thus, \u201cthe divine\norder,\u201d one of several literal renderings of the Arabic term,\ncorresponds to the supreme level in the hierarchy of things, which God,\nits supreme member, has willed to be as it is. The second connotation\nof \u201cthe divine order,\u201d which is derived from the first,\nsignifies the gift or influx of prophecy, both as an experience of the\ndivine and as the power, capacity, or faculty within the soul that\nenables one to apprehend it. (K 1: 4, 25, 43, 95, 97, 109) It is\ntypically bestowed on those belonging to the divine dispensation as a\nsign of favor or recognition of noble rank in a special audience with\nGod or a divine appointee that typically confers recondite information,\nspecific instructions, and special powers to speak or act on his\nbehalf, along with the possibility of future access. In this sense,\nbestowal of the divine order\nquaprophetic gift is comparable to\nwhat a patron does in awarding an order of merit or a commission to his\nclient or what a monarch does when conferring the Order of the Empire\nupon a worthy subject. The third and final connotation of \u201cthe\ndivine order\u201d signifies orders or commands in the conventional\nsense of directives that mandate what pleases God and prohibit what\ndispleases him. However, even this very specific sense of the term\nsometimes allows for a broader usage that signifies the power or\nauthority that lies behind such commands. (K 1: 87,\n98; 2: 4, 6, 50; 3:23, 53)\nReferences to the divine order in this third sense clearly presuppose\nthe prior reception of prophecy itself and whatever knowledge or\ninstruction it provides, plus the transmission of such knowledge over\ntime through reliable tradition from parent to child and teacher to\nstudent. Without these, one can only speculate about divine things in\ngeneral terms and largely out of ignorance.\n6. Qualifications for the Attainment of Prophecy and Prophetic Knowledge\n\n\nIt remains, then, to identify what prerequisites must be\nsatisfied if a member of the divine order, understood as dispensation,\nis to attain prophecy and with it receive knowledge of hidden things.\nNotwithstanding Halevi's generally critical stance towards\nphilosophy and the philosopher's opening statement, he does not\nrefrain from appropriating from the philosopher's presentation\nthose elements that he believes to be correct and which might serve,\nwhen fully explained, to advance his general argument on behalf of the\nJews and Judaism. Accordingly, he, too, highlights the influence of (1)\nparents and relatives, (2) geographic environment, as well as (3)\neducation and training as indispensable for realizing as fully as\npossible whatever capacity members of the divine order possess to\nbecome prophets or, at the very least, pious friends of God, just as\nthe philosopher identifies these same factors in the formation of the\nperfect individual who allegedly attains union with the Active\nIntellect.\n\n\nRegarding the first prerequisite, superior lineage, Halevi\ndoes not state explicitly whether the influence of parents and\nrelatives should be construed in biological or psychological terms, or\nperhaps both. Interpreters have tended to understand it as being\nbiological or at least quasi-biological, insofar as it is the means by\nwhich qualified individuals are endowed with or\ninherit a divine faculty that comes after the\nintellect and facilitates contact with God as well as knowledge of\ntruths with only the slightest reflection. (K 1: 95) According to the\nsage, Adam, who was God's own creation and perfectly made, was\nendowed with it. However, he did not succeed in transmitting this\nfaculty to all or even most of his offspring. On the contrary, for\ngenerations it manifested itself only in unique individuals like Abel,\nSeth, Enosh, Noah and others on through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, each\nof whom was the choicest offspring of his father. Sometimes it even\nskipped over a generation. Ultimately, however, all of Jacob's\nsons proved fit for the divine order, and eventually all of their\noffspring, both male and female, came to be endowed with it. It is\nnoteworthy that the presence or absence of this faculty is not\nattributed to a divine choice, but rather to the fitness or unfitness\nof the potential recipients. Still, this unusual pattern of\ntransmission does not make a strictly biological explanation\nparticularly compelling. Further, when it is recalled that the Khazar\nking originally spoke of the secret character of the divine order in\nconjunction with the secret character of certain\nsouls, (K 1:4) a psychological or\neven cultural mode of transmission becomes more plausible. This is\nespecially so when the sage later speaks of the divine faculty or\ncapacity as \u201cthe eye of prophecy,\u201d (K 2:24) and later still\nas the \u201cinner eye\u201d which is \u201calmost\u201d the same\nas \u201cthe imaginative faculty as long as it serves the intellectual\nfaculty.\u201d (K 4:3) All of these remarks all suggest that he is\nprobably referring to either an exceptionally powerful internal sense\nor to a distinctive way of seeing or interpreting what is seen, which\nmight help to explain the link between familial ties and experiencing\nprophecy. Yet even here, Halevi's language is sufficiently\nequivocal to allow for a wide range of interpretations.\n\n\nThe second prerequisite stipulates that one must dwell\nwithin the geographic environment that uniquely fosters the attainment\nof prophecy or for the sake of which it occurs. That turns out to be\nthe region variously identified as Syro-Palestine or the Land of\nIsrael. Halevi explains the region's special standing in terms of\nits ideal configuration of temperate climate, its placement at the\ncenter of the inhabited world (as then known), and its location on the\naxis mundi that historically links heaven and\nearth through prophecy, as depicted in Jacob's dream. For all\nthese reasons, it represents the optimal location not only for the\nattainment of prophecy by qualified members of the divine order, but\nalso for living out the \u201cway of life characteristic of\nGod's kingdom\u201d (K 5: 20, 4th premise) mandated\nby the revealed Law and intended for all who participate in that order,\nwhether by birth or by choice. Indeed, God is portrayed as\ntransplanting \u201chis people\u201d to \u201chis land,\u201d in\norder to realize his purpose for the land itself\u2014to guide the\nentire inhabited world in the right path. (K 1: 95; 2: 9\u201324; 5:\n22\u201328)\n\n\nThe third and final prerequisite identifies exactly what the\ninstruction and training mentioned in the philosopher's speech\nconsists in, if it is to culminate in the experience of prophecy. Here,\nabstract principles, general guidelines, and ad hoc\njudgments, no matter how intelligent or astute, do not suffice\nto produce the desired result. Only adherence to the specific\ncommandments and prohibitions embodied in the Written and Oral Law from\nGod can do so. That is because the specifics in their totality and due\nproportion constitute a regimen that imparts to human souls both the\nconduct and the disposition of the angels. Indeed, Halevi claims that\nperseverance in performing acts mandated by the Law raises one to the\nlevel of revelation, which is the human level closest to the divine. (K\n1: 87, 98; 2:48, 50; 3: 7, 11, 53; 4:19; 5:20, 4th\npremise)\n\n\nWhat ties together these three prerequisites is\nHalevi's attempt to give both actual and specific content to what\nthe philosopher sketched out only in broad outline. His emphasis on\nspecific ancestry and lineage was surely intended to call attention to\nactual people whose lives were characterized by special relationships\nthat could affect the course of history and, as a result, to reconnect\none's own life with theirs. His emphasis on a particular\ngeographical environment was plainly intended to renew and strengthen\nhis people's sense of connection to and love for their ancestral\nhome and, given both the dialogue's ending and Halevi's own\nchoice, a willingness to return it. His emphasis, finally, on the\ncommandments as the clearest embodiments of what is pleasing to God was\nclearly meant to nourish not only respect for the nobility of\nIsrael's ancestral way of life, but also to encourage renewed\ncommitment to that life as defined by worthy deeds and self-mastery\nover and above pleasing intentions and intellectually respectable\nopinions. By the same token, his elaboration of these prerequisites\nover the course of the dialogue may also be intended as a critique of\nphilosophy in the sense that it is by its very nature unable to provide\nmore than general principles and guidelines in the realm of action. Its\npreoccupation with the search for universals inevitably finds claims\nabout special qualities, places, relationships and actions to be, more\noften than not, problematic or na\u00efve, and what Halevi would regard\nas appropriate concern with matters of detail, outside its\npurview.\n7. The Problem of Creation vs. the Eternity of the World\n\n\nWhile the sage fully appreciates that the Khazar\nking's principal concern is to learn what actions are pleasing\nand displeasing, he also recognizes that the king has been perplexed\nand preoccupied from the beginning with the claim that God created the\nworld out of nothing in six days. The discussion of the divine order\nand of what the attributes of the undisputed prophet are made it clear\nthat knowledge of hidden things in both the past and future was one\nsuch attribute. So it is that in the course of responding to a query\nabout the reliability of the Bible's chronology, the sage\naddresses himself to several of the reasons for the king's\nperplexity about creation, and he does so in unexpected ways. First, he\nflatly dismisses claims about the great antiquity of certain monuments\nin India that allegedly refute the Bible's chronology and of\ncertain records that name people who lived before Adam. He argues that\nthese claims are unconfirmed and that the uneducated multitude which\naccepts such things is wayward and unreliable. It is precisely because\nthe multitude lacks both well established beliefs and an agreed-upon\nchronology, such as the Jews possess, that they succumb so easily to\ncredulousness.\n\n\nWhen the sage is reminded, however, that the philosophers\nbelieve in the past-eternity of the world and support their claims by\nscrupulous investigation, the sage rejects the philosopher's view\nof the past-eternity of the world as well. However, he also excuses the\nphilosophers for being mistaken because their lineage and geographical\nenvironment have left them poorly equipped to receive or acquire, not\nto mention preserve and transmit, reliable information on the matter.\nAs Greeks, they were descendents of Yaphet rather than Shem, which\nmeans that they lacked knowledge confirmed by a divine order (i.e., a\nprophetic experience apprehended by the divine faculty that sees things\nas they really are). Accordingly, they could only speculate about the\nmatter. In addition, the variability and instability of the northern\nclimates contributed to the destruction or loss of what knowledge they\ndid have. The opposite holds true for the descendents of Shem and the\nregion that was their home. Having no special claim to credibility,\nAristotle's view should not be accepted. In fact, the arguments\nfor the two positions turn out to be evenly balanced against each other\nand are therefore inconclusive. In the end, Aristotle preferred the\nidea of the world's past-eternity because of an essentially\ncultural predilection for the abstract argumentation supporting it and,\nof course, because he lacked a reliable tradition supporting the\ncontrary view. Having no such tradition of his own, he never even\nthought to ask others about theirs. Had he lived within a nation that\npossessed such a tradition, like Israel's own, Halevi contends\nthat he would certainly have argued for the\npossibility of creation, for, as the sage\npoints out most emphatically in an oath, the Torah teaches nothing that\ndirectly contradicts the clear evidence of sense experience or the\nconclusion of a genuine demonstration. Halevi does not spell out why he\nthinks Aristotle would have decided to argue for the opposing view, but\nit seems to have some connection with the status and function of oaths,\nwhich calls for further reflection. In any event, even if it were\neventually proven that matter is eternal into the past and many worlds\npreceded this one, an adherent of the Law would still be able to\nmaintain that traditions about the temporal origin of\nthis world and its earliest\ninhabitants remain intact and his faith unimpaired.\n8. The Origin of the Jewish Religion and the Theophany at Sinai\n\n\nHalevi's treatment of the theophany at Sinai presents a\nremarkably rich, nuanced, yet compact summary of familiar themes in the\nbiblical accounts of this axial event, set within the context of the\nliberation from bondage. At the same time, it links up with other\nsignificant themes already discussed or elaborated on later in the\ndialogue. Following a brief discussion of what we can know about\nnature, causation, and divine agency, (K 1:68\u201379) the king asks the\nsage to tell him how his religion developed and spread beyond its point\nof origin, how it overcame internal dissension to achieve unity, and\nhow it eventually became well established. From the question itself, it\nis obvious that the king conceives of Judaism's emergence in\npurely naturalistic terms, akin to what the sage had previously\nidentified as a syllogistic, governmental religion. Much to his\nsurprise, however, the sage asserts that only man-made\nnomoi (laws) arise in this way, while\na nomos that has its origin\nin God arises suddenly. On being told to be, it obediently came into\nbeing, just like the creation of the world. The king confesses to being\nawestruck by this unexpected declaration, although it is unclear\nwhether he is more impressed by the miraculous suddenness of what is\nclaimed or the element of obedience associated with it.\n\nHalevi builds upon this ambiguity as the sage proceeds to describe the\nremarkable loyalty, courage, cohesiveness, and sheer endurance of the\nHebrew slaves. He traces their path out of the humiliation and misery\nof Egyptian slavery to their ultimate deliverance under the leadership\nof Moses and Aaron, amidst miraculous plagues announced in advance. He\ngoes on to recount their subsequent rescue at the sea and, finally, the\nbeginning of their journey into the wilderness of Sinai. Although the\nsage matter-of-factly characterizes the story as lengthy and\nwell-known, the king's response registers its intended effect. He\nsays that this is truly the divine order at work, since no doubt about\nthese events having come about through magic, subterfuge or imagination\ngrips the heart. While his informal survey of\npossible explanations is by no means exhaustive, it does underscore the\npeople's belief that their God can indeed do whatever he wishes\nwhenever he wishes\u2014at least within the parameters of the story as\ntold thus far. However, it does not dispel either their doubt or the\nking's own doubt as to whether God enters into contact with flesh\nand blood. Halevi makes it clear that the theophany at Sinai was\nintended to resolve that doubt once and for all. (K\n1:80\u201387)\n\nIn the first of the discussion's three phases, the nature of this\npersistent doubt is explained. The people are convinced that speaking\nis a corporeal phenomenon, presumably because physical organs are\nneeded both to produce and to apprehend the sounds and a physical\nmedium such as air is needed to carry or convey them. But if that is\nso, speech without a flesh and blood speaker seems highly unlikely.\nYet, the people had also come to believe that God was well above the\ncharacteristics and accoutrements of flesh and blood. To remove both\nthe doubt itself and the concomitant supposition that any allegedly\ndivine Law actually had to be the result of human thought and opinion,\nthe people were instructed first to prepare inwardly and outwardly over\nthree days of great terror for the theophany to come. Significantly,\nhowever, when Halevi undertakes to describe the momentous revelation,\nhe carefully distinguishes between the events that the people\nwitnessed, on the one hand, and how they reported and transmitted what\nthey apprehended, on the other. What they actually witnessed was (1)\nlightning, thunder, earthquakes, and fires that surrounded the\nmountain; (2) Moses entering and emerging from the fire, alive; (3) the\npresentation of the Ten Commandments; and (4) the stone tablets\ninscribed with divine writing. The description is uncharacteristically\nbare of any reference to God having said or done anything and likewise\nbereft of any biblical citations to fill in the lacunae.\n\nImmediately afterwards, the sage indicates that the multitude did not\ntransmit the Ten Commandments as something declared by individuals\namong them or by a prophet, but by God. Later, when Moses had been\nasked to serve as their intermediary with God, they believed that he\nwas addressed by speech that had its origin in God, but without prior\nthought on his part. To make the point of God's involvement\nclearer still, we are told that when Moses came down from the mountain\nwith the inscribed tablets in hand, all conjectures about his having\nformulated the Ten Commandments on his own or with the help of the\nActive Intellect, or as a figment of his imagination while dreaming\nwere refuted by the theophany itself\u2014a clear invitation to\nre-examine what they witnessed\u2014and by the fact that the people\n\u201csaw them asdivine writing, just as\nthey heard them as divine\nspeech.\u201d (K1:87; italics added) Given the fact that Halevi was an\naccomplished poet and sensitive to the nuances of language, there is\nevery reason to suppose that he knew that \u201cseeing\u201d and\n\u201cseeing as\u201d do not signify the same kind of activity. The\nrelational and interpretive character of \u201cseeing as\u201d and\n\u201chearing as\u201d raises the possibility that the imagination\nmay have had at least some role in how the people understood the events\nthey witnessed, even though the only explicit reference to it thus far\ndenies it any role in what Moses experienced. By the end of this phase\nof Halevi's discussion, (K 1:87) it is clear that the skeptical\nIsraelites have at last been persuaded that God does enter into contact\nwith flesh and blood. They are plainly unanimous about what they\nexperienced and unanimous about accepting the Law as divine and\nauthoritative. From the standpoint of the king's four criteria\nfor resolving his own skepticism, the sage's account would seem\nto have addressed them all with the added prospect that political\nbenefits like stability and cohesiveness might likewise result from his\nfollowing the Israelites example. (cf. K 1: 21\u201322)\n\nIn the second phase of the discussion, (K 1: 88\u201390) the king offers two\nresponses to what he has heard, but neither one explicitly states his\nown view. The first suggests that \u201csomeone\u201d who hears all\nthat the sage described would surely be excused for supposing that Jews\nbelieve that God is corporeal. In saying this, he calls attention to a\ncommon misunderstanding many people have upon first encountering\nbiblical and rabbinic narratives relating to God. The second response\naddresses the sage, and through him the Jews generally, by allowing\nthat they, too, may be excused for rejecting reason and speculation\nbecause of the undeniable and plainly visible sights\njust related. By excusing his interlocutor and those he\nrepresents, however, the king indicates, albeit indirectly, his own\nacceptance of the evidence presented and, with it, the implication that\nexperience trumps both reason and speculation, (cf. K 1:4, 5)\napparently without qualification. This plainly ignores several of the\nmore qualified observations offered by the sage (e.g., the\n\u201cseeing\u201d/ \u201cseeing as\u201d distinction), but it also\nshows that the king has reached one of several turning points that\nculminate in his conversion to Judaism (K 2:1) and his continuing\neducation through the end of the dialogue.\n\nUnlike the king, the sage is by no means prepared to jettison reason\nand speculation altogether, even and perhaps especially in defense of\nhis faith. Thus, he invokes God's name in an informal oath, once\nagain, to forbid the acceptance of anything that the intellect regards\nas absurd or impossible, which in the case at hand would clearly apply\nto construing God as corporeal. While his oath is surely no syllogistic\nargument, it is a performative utterance to be taken with the utmost\nseriousness, especially when the strictures against taking God's\nname in vain are recalled. By speaking in this manner, the sage\nacknowledges the supremacy of the divine order in all of its senses,\nbut he does this now in defense of reason and\nrationality. Since oaths are taken, in part, to\nestablish truth in an inquiry, his purpose in taking this oath is\nevidently to base all inquiries in pursuit of the truth on the\nauthority of the Law and respect for its foundations. He illustrates\nthe point by noting that the first of the Ten Commandments mandates the\nacceptance of God's sovereignty, and his oath assuredly does\nthis. The second Commandment, in turn, forbids representing God\ncorporeally in any form. If\nso, it would be utterly absurd for the Law to presuppose what it\nprohibits (i.e., that God must be corporeal), given what the Bible\nrelates about the great theophany.\n\nOnce the religious and legal basis for reason's denial of divine\ncorporeality is established, the sage does not hesitate to offer a\nspeculative argument of his own. He presents it in the a\nfortioriform often used to interpret the Law\nand argues that if we maintain that many of God's creations are\nabove corporeality, \u201clike the rational soul, which is what man is\nin reality,\u201d how shall we not maintain that God is also above\ncorporeality? Using Moses as an example, he notes that the part of\nMoses that speaks to, understands, and governs his people is not his\ntongue, brain, or heart, which are merely organs and instruments\nbelonging to him, but rather his rational soul, which is what he really\nis. On the basis of this clearly Platonic conception of the soul, he\ngoes on to argue that, owing to the soul's incorporeality, no\nplace is too narrow for it to enter, nor is it too narrow for the forms\nof all created things to\nfind a place in it. The restriction of what the soul may eventually\nunderstand to created things is entirely consistent with the\nsage's account of the hierarchy of being. What is unexpected and\nultimately more important is that Halevi gives enormous latitude to\nwhat the soul, or, more concretely stated, philosophers and natural\nscientists, may inquire into and understand within the created world\nitself. Whatever the limits of our capacity to understand divine things\nrationally, he is certainly not an irrationalist or even an\nanti-rationalist if that is understood to mean someone who completely\nrejects inquiry and theorizing. The second phase ends with the sage\nreminding the king that we must not reject what has been transmitted\nabout the theophany, but say instead that we do not understand how\nthese events and the miraculous deliverances that accompanied them took\nplace. As noted above, \u201cwhat has been transmitted\u201d includes\nnot only Moses\u2019 reports but also the multitude's\nunderstanding and interpretation of what took place, and, insofar as\nthis, too, is preserved in the Written and Oral Law, rejecting it would\nbe tantamount to rejecting the Law itself and with it the social\ncontract that it embodies. Thus, it is not surprising that the king\naccepts all that has been said as persuasive for the purposes of\nargument.\n \n\nIn the third and concluding part of the discussion, (K 1:90) the\nsage acknowledges that he is not saying categorically that the matter\ntook place just as he described. He allows that it may have taken\nplace in an even more profound way than he can imagine. Here,\nthe sage's admission would seem to create some difficulty for\nhis earlier claim that uninterrupted tradition is as valid as direct\nobservation. (K 1: 25; 5: 14) However, it also invites his\ninterlocutor and the reader to fulfill the last of the king's\nfour requirements or criteria for overcoming his skepticism about\nrevelation, namely to study and test the evidence repeatedly, but now\nit is in order to arrive at a more profound understanding of it.\n\n\nPerhaps most unexpected of all is the sage's explicit reference to\nrole of imagination in relating events of the past. Despite his\nefforts to dismiss philosophical accounts of the imagination's role in\ndream prophecy and its mimetic function in intellectual prophecy, he\nnow accords it a role in representing decisive events from the\npast. By the time imagination reappears in Halevi's discussion of the\n\u201cinner eye\u201d of prophecy, (K 4:3) it also has a role in\nunderstanding and interpreting events, states of affairs, and the\nnatures of created things in the present. The question that remains to\nbe answered is whether the inner eye had the same function and also\nperformed that function in connection with the events associated with\nthe theophany at Sinai. Halevi does not address the issue. The most\nthat he is prepared to say is that those who witnessed those events,\nnoting especially the events' unprecedented character, were convinced\nthat they came from the Creator without intermediary, as did the\ncreation of the world itself. That is why faith in the divine Law is\nthereafter associated by the faithful with a matching faith that the\nworld, too, is God's entirely originated creation.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a name=\"SecSou\">Secondary Sources</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<h4>Editions and Translations of the <em>Kuzari</em> (cited as K)</h4>\n<ul>", "Ha-Levi, Judah, <em>The Kuzari\u2013The Book of Refutation and\nProof on the Despised Faith</em>, transliterated into Arabic and\nedited by Nabih Bashir with the assistance of \u2018Abed\n\u2018l-Salam Mousa, Freiburg an Niedersachsen: Al-Kamel\nVerlag, 2012.", "Ha-Levi, Judah b.
