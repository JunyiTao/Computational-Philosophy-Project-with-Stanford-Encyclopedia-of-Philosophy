    "main_text": "Brouwer\n1. Brouwer\n\nLuitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer was born in Overschie, the Netherlands.\nHe studied mathematics and physics at the University of Amsterdam,\nwhere he obtained his PhD in 1907. In 1909 he became a lecturer at the\nsame university, where he was appointed full professor in 1912, a\nposition he held until his retirement in 1951. Brouwer was a brilliant\nmathematician who did ground-breaking work in topology and became\nfamous already at a young age. All his life he was an independent mind\nwho pursued the things he believed in with ardent vigor, which brought\nhim in conflict with many a colleague, most notably with David\nHilbert. He had admirers as well, and in his house \u201cthe\nhut\u201d in Blaricum he welcomed many well-known mathematicians of\nhis time. To the end of his life he became more isolated, but his\nbelief in the truth of his philosophy never wavered. He died in a car\naccident at the age of 85 in Blaricum, seven years after the death of\nhis wife Lize Brouwer. \n\nAt the age of 24 Brouwer wrote the book Life, Art and\nMysticism (Brouwer 1905), whose solipsistic content foreshadows\nhis philosophy of mathematics. In his dissertation the foundations of\nintuitionism are formulated for the first time, although not yet under\nthat name and not in their final form. In the first years after his\ndissertation most of Brouwer\u2019s scientific life was devoted to\ntopology, an area in which he is still known for his theory of\ndimension and his fixed point theorem. This work is part of classical\nmathematics; according to Brouwer\u2019s later view, his fixed point\ntheorem does not hold, although an analogue cast in terms of\napproximations can be proved to hold according to his principles.\n\nFrom 1913 on, Brouwer increasingly dedicated himself to the\ndevelopment of the ideas formulated in his dissertation into a full\nphilosophy of mathematics. He not only refined the philosophy of\nintuitionism but also reworked mathematics, especially the theory of\nthe continuum and the theory of sets, according to these principles.\nBy then, Brouwer was a famous mathematician who gave influential\nlectures on intuitionism at the scientific meccas of that time,\nCambridge, Vienna, and G\u00f6ttingen among them. His philosophy was\nconsidered awkward by many, but treated as a serious alternative to\nclassical reasoning by some of the most famous mathematicians of his\ntime, even when they had a different view on the matter. Kurt\nG\u00f6del, who was a Platonist all his life, was one of them. Hermann\nWeyl at one point wrote \u201cSo gebe ich also jetzt meinen eigenen\nVersuch Preis und schlie\u00dfe mich Brouwer an\u201d (Weyl 1921,\n56). And although he rarely practised intuitionistic mathematics later\nin life, Weyl never stopped admiring Brouwer and his intuitionistic\nphilosophy of mathematics.\n\nThe life of Brouwer was laden with conflicts, the most famous one\nbeing the conflict with David Hilbert, which eventually led to\nBrouwer\u2019s expulsion from the board of the Mathematische\nAnnalen. This conflict was part of the Grundlagenstreit\nthat shook the mathematical society at the beginning of the 20th\ncentury and that emerged as a result of the appearance of paradoxes\nand highly nonconstructive proofs in mathematics. Philosophers and\nmathematicians were forced to acknowledge the lack of an\nepistemological and ontological basis for mathematics. Brouwer\u2019s\nintuitionism is a philosophy of mathematics that aims to provide such\na foundation.\n",
