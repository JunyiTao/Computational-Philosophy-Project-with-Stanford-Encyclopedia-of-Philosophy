    "main_text": "Kantian Roots\n1. Kantian Roots\n\nKant sets forth several formulations of the categorical imperative,\nthat is, the principle he holds to be the supreme principle of\nmorality. One formulation, often called the \u201cFormula of\nHumanity\u201d states:\n\n\nSo act that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the\nperson of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely\nas a means. (Kant 1785: 429, italics\n removed)[2]\n\n\nThe Formula of Humanity contains the command that we ought never to\ntreat persons merely as means.[3] A few points regarding this command\nare helpful to keep in view. First, Kant holds that if a person treats\nsomeone merely as a means, then she acts wrongly. The Formula of\nHumanity encompasses an absolute constraint against treating persons\nmerely as means. Second, Kant does not hold that if in acting a person\nrefrains from treating anyone merely as a means, then she acts rightly\n(Kant 1797: 395). A person can, for example, act wrongly in\nKant\u2019s view by expressing contempt for another, even if she is\nnot using him at all (Kant 1797: 462\u2013464). She would be acting\nwrongly by failing to treat the other as an end in himself, rather\nthan by treating him merely as a means. A third related point is that,\naccording to Kant, it is both a necessary and a sufficient condition\nfor one\u2019s treating persons in a morally permissible way that one\ntreat them as ends in themselves (Hill 1992: 41\u201342). Some\nKantians, especially those engaged primarily in interpretation, rather\nthan reconstruction, of his views thus understandably hold that far\nmore important than understanding his position on treating persons\nmerely as means is understanding his account of treating persons as\nends in themselves (Wood 1999, 143). Fourth, Kant holds that a person\ncan treat herself merely as a means. If a person acts contrary to\ncertain \u201cperfect duties to oneself\u201d (Kant 1797: 421),\nincluding her duty not to kill herself (422\u2013423), not to defile\nherself by lust (424\u2013425), and not to lie (429\u2013430), then\nshe treats herself merely as a means, thereby contravening the Formula\nof Humanity. It is difficult to discern how, according to Kant, one\ntreats oneself merely as a means in violating these duties (Kerstein\n2008; Timmons 2017: Ch. 7). How, for example, does a person\u2019s\nlying to another amount to her treating herself merely as a means?\n\nIn any case, this article\u2019s focus is on treating others merely\nas means. Doing that is widely discussed as a possible violation of a\nmoral constraint. More specifically, the article explores when someone\nuses another and either treats or refrains from treating the other\nmerely as a means. It concentrates on concepts that seem to have roots\nin Kant\u2019s work, but that are familiar from ordinary moral\n discourse.[3]\n Kant himself devotes little discussion to clarifying the notion of\ntreating others merely as\n means.[4]\n Yet as is apparent below, some of his remarks have been a springboard\nfor detailed accounts of the notion.\n\nOne salient issue outside the article\u2019s purview is that of the\nscope of \u201cothers\u201d in the prescription not to treat others\nmerely as means. Does Kant embrace among these others all genetically\nhuman beings, including human embryos and individuals in a persistent\nvegetative state, or does he limit the others to beings who have\ncertain capacities, for example, that to set and rationally pursue\nends (Kain 2009; Sussman 2001)? How should Kant or other theorists set\nthe scope of those whom we ought not to treat merely as means? Should\nwe include some non-human animals (e.g., chimpanzees or dolphins)\namong them? How should we determine to whom to grant this moral\nstatus?\n",
