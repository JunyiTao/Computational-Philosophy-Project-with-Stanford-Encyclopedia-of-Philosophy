    "main_text": "History || Rationalization as a Thematic Unity\n3.1 Rationalization as a Thematic Unity\n\nWeber\u2019s main contribution as such, nonetheless, lies neither in\nepistemology nor in ethics. Although they deeply informed his thoughts\nto an extent still under-appreciated, his main concern lay elsewhere.\nHe was after all one of the founding fathers of modern social science.\nBeyond the recognition, however, that Weber is not simply a\nsociologist par excellence as Talcott Parsons\u2019s\nquasi-Durkheimian interpretation made him out to be, identifying an\nid\u00e9e ma\u00eetresse throughout his disparate oeuvre\nhas been debated ever since his own days and is still far from\nsettled. Economy and Society, his alleged magnum\nopus, was a posthumous publication based upon his widow\u2019s\neditorship, the thematic architectonic of which is unlikely to be\nreconstructed beyond doubt even after its recent reissuing under the\nrubric of Max Weber Gesamtausgabe [MWG hereafter].\nGARS forms a more coherent whole since its editorial edifice\nwas the work of Weber himself; and yet, its relationship to his other\nsociologies of, for instance, law, city, music, domination, and\neconomy, remains controvertible. Accordingly, his overarching theme\nhas also been variously surmised as a developmental history of Western\nrationalism (Wolfgang Schluchter), the universal history of\nrationalist culture (Friedrich Tenbruck), or simply the\nMenschentum as it emerges and degenerates in modern rational\nsociety (Wilhelm Hennis). The first depicts Weber as a\ncomparative-historical sociologist; the second, a latter-day Idealist\nhistorian of culture reminiscent of Jacob Burckhardt; and the third, a\npolitical philosopher on a par with Machiavelli, Hobbes, and Rousseau.\nImportant as they are for in-house Weber scholarship, however, these\nphilological disputes need not hamper our attempt to grasp the gist of\nhis ideas. Suffice it for us to recognize that, albeit with varying\ndegrees of emphasis, these different interpretations all converge on\nthe thematic centrality of rationality, rationalism, and\nrationalization in making sense of Weber.\n\nAt the outset, what immediately strikes a student of Weber\u2019s\nrationalization thesis is its seeming irreversibility and\nEurocentrism. The apocalyptic imagery of the \u201ciron cage\u201d\nthat haunts the concluding pages of the Protestant Ethic is\ncommonly taken to reflect his fatalism about the inexorable unfolding\nof rationalization and its culmination in the complete loss of freedom\nand meaning in the modern world. The \u201cAuthor\u2019s\nIntroduction\u201d (Vorbemerkung to GARS) also\ncontains oft-quoted passages that allegedly disclose Weber\u2019s\nbelief in the unique singularity of Western civilization\u2019s\nachievement in the direction of rationalization, or lack thereof in\nother parts of the world. For example:\n\nA child of modern European civilization (Kulturwelt) who\nstudies problems of universal history shall inevitably and justfiably\nraise the question (Fragestellung): what combination of\ncircumstances have led to the fact that in the West, and here only,\ncultural phenomena have appeared which \u2013 at least as we\nlike to think \u2013 came to have universal significance and\nvalidity [Weber 1920/1992, 13: translation altered]?\n\n\nTaken together, then, the rationalization process as Weber narrated it\nseems quite akin to a metahistorical teleology that irrevocably sets\nthe West apart from and indeed above the East.\n\nAt the same time, nonetheless, Weber adamantly denied the possibility\nof a universal law of history in his methodological essays. Even\nwithin the same pages of Vorbemerkung, he said,\n\u201crationalizations of the most varied character have existed in\nvarious departments of life and in all areas of culture\u201d\n[Ibid., 26]. He also made clear that his study of various\nforms of world religions was to be taken for its heuristic value\nrather than as \u201ccomplete analyses of cultures, however\nbrief\u201d [Ibid., 27]. It was meant as a\ncomparative-conceptual platform on which to erect the edifying\nfeatures of rationalization in the West. If merely a heuristic device\nand not a universal law of progress, then, what is rationalization and\nwhence comes his uncompromisingly dystopian vision?\n",
