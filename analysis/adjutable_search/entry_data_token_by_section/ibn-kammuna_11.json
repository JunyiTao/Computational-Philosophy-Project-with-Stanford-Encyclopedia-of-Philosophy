    "main_text": "Shubahat: Paradoxes, Problems, and Sophistries\n8. Recent Editions\n\nIt is a common complaint in the field of Islamic philosophy,\nespecially in its post-Avicennan phases, that we lack editions of\nprimary texts; this complaint was voiced in the first version of this\nentry. In the intervening years, not a few editions of writings by Ibn\nKammuna have appeared. Two key texts have been reissued in the\noriginal. Dr Lwiis Saliba has reissued the Tanq\u012bh\u0323 al-Abh\u0323\u0101th\n(Examination the Three Faiths, published by Byblion, in\nByblos, Lebanon 2009; a second printing was made already in 2010) in a\nvolume of nearly 600 pages, provided with a detailed introduction and\ncopious notes, all in Arabic, but with a very good command of academic\npublications in European languages. Simon Bellahsen has published a\nFrench translation of the Examination, including a\ntranslation of portions from the biography in Pourjavady and Schmidtke\n2006: Examen de la critique des trois religions monoth\u00e9istes,\nParis: Vrin, 2012. H.J. Isfahani published a new edition of\nthe New Wisdom, which he chose to give an alternative title,\nKit\u0101b al-K\u0101shif (The Revealor), published jointly by\nthe Iranian Institute of Philosophy and the Institute of Islamic\nStudies of the Free University of Berlin, Tehran 2008.\n\n\n\nOnly a very small portion of the commentary to\nSuhrawardi\u2019s Talwihat was published by Ziai and Alwishah. Now\ntwo editions of the full text have been prepared: a three volume\ndoctoral dissertation by Sayyid H.S. Musawi (Tehran University, 1385\nSolar, 1996/1997) and a three volume publication by N. Habibi (Tehran\n1387 Solar, 2008/2009.) Joep Lameer scoured all three editions and\npublished a thirty page review (2012). He concludes that we are still\nin need of a reliable edition.\n\n\nThese are welcome developments, to be sure, but there is cause for\nfurther reflection. In particular, the arguments advanced by Ibn\nKammuna have as a rule not been taken into account by the editors, who\nmust decide between variants in the manuscripts, or by the critics who\nreview the editions. Simply taking note of variants missed by one or\nmore editor, even if these seem to be significant, is not enough; we\nwould like to see a discussion of sample passages, with full analysis\nof the implications of the different readings. At times there is no\ngrammatical, syntactical, or lexical reason a priori to choose one\nvariant over the other. Without fully understanding the passage in\nquestion, errors may ensue; an example of this given by Langermann\n2009, p. 282. Earlier editions must not be dismissed as worthless\nunless one can provide examples to prove such an extreme\nclaim. Moreover, changing the title of a book in mid-course without\nany justification (all agree, for example, that Ibn Kammuna himself\ngave no title to the work commonly referred to as the New\nWisdom) introduces confusion with no compensatory payoff. \n",
