    "main_text": "Main Themes in ER || God and Divine Attributes\n5.3 God and Divine Attributes\n\n\nIbn Daud deviates significantly from his predecessors since he does\nnot deduce the existence of God from creation. In fact, as we shall\nlater see, Ibn Daud has little to say on the issue of creation.\nInstead, his two proofs are based on Aristotle\u2019s theory of\nmotion, which presents a novelty in medieval Jewish thought. The first\nproof makes use of two theses that were proven in the sections on\nmotion and infinity respectively: firstly, there is no motion without a\nmover, and secondly, the existence of an infinite series in actuality\nis impossible. On the basis of these premises, Ibn Daud establishes the\nexistence of a first unmoved mover. Unlike Aristotle, however, he does\nnot base the incorporeality and infinity of this first mover on the\neternity of motion; an Aristotelian doctrine that he prefers to leave\nunmentioned. The second proof is based on the distinction between\nnecessary and possible (or contingent) existents. The latter class of\nexistents derives their existence from a cause. Since an infinite\nregress of causes is impossible, the series of contingent beings must\nend with the existence of an uncaused being who is called the Necessary\nBeing and whose essence suffices for its existence. Evidently Ibn Daud\nconsidered the second to be a better proof than the first given that it\nyields a first principle of being, instead of merely a first principle\nof motion. The contrast with earlier Jewish philosophers also comes to\nthe fore in Ibn Daud\u2019s designations of God, such as \u201cthe\nfirst unmoved mover\u201d, \u201cthe necessary being\u201d or\n\u201cthe first cause\u201d rather than \u201cthe Creator\u201d.\nThese appellations are wholly in line with his stated aim of guiding\nthe reader to a philosophical conception of God. However, at the same\ntime, it is evident that he identifies this first principle with the\nGod of the Bible, an equation for which he does not provide any\narguments.\n\n\nThis God is absolutely one, both in the sense of unique (God is\nexternally one) and in the sense of simple (God is internally one,or uncomposed).\nGod\u2019s unity implies that he cannot have essential or accidental\nattributes since that would imply plurality in the divine\nessence. Therefore, the attributes that are often ascribed to God,\nsuch as that he is one, existent, true, mighty etc. etc. should be\ninterpreted either negatively, or as relations. According to Ibn Daud,\n\u201cthe truest predicates or attributes of God are the negations\n[\u2026] and although they remove many doubts, they do not convey\nanything\u201d (ER W 51.9\u201312; S 131b15\u2013131b3). To remedy\nthis, Ibn Daud interprets the negations as negations of something,\nnamely of similarity, that is, as expressions of incomparability. For\nexample, with regard to the predication of unity to God, he argues\nthat since among all essences nothing can be found that is like God,\n\u201cwe know His unity in such a way that we know that His unity is\nnot like that of any other thing that is called\n\u2018one\u2019\u201d (ER W 52.25\u201327; S 133b1\u20133). As for\nattributes understood as relations, Ibn Daud explains:\n\n Like someone can be described, for example, in that he is the son of\na certain man, and the father of a second and the uncle of a third, the\nmaternal uncle of a fourth, the friend of a fifth and the enemy of a\nsixth [\u2026] this [kind of predication] is not impossible. Indeed\nmultiple relations do not imply multiplicity in the essence of what is\ndescribed by them. And in this way we can describe the Creator with\nmany attributes since they are relations between Him and the other\nexistents (ER W 54.29\u201335; S 136b8\u201314).\n \n",
