    "main_text": "Physical Objects and Kinds\n5. Physical Objects and Kinds\n\nAlthough Beardsley\u2019s early views on ontology tended to either\nlinguistic phenomenalism or unsystematic pluralism, there were hints,\neven at that time, of a simpler and more commonsensical view. That\nontology can be seen lurking beneath the surface of his postulates of\nart criticism:\n\nThe aesthetic object is a perceptual object; that is, it can have\npresentations.\nPresentations of the same aesthetic object may occur at different\ntimes and to different people.\nTwo presentations of the same aesthetic object may differ from\neach other.\nThe characteristics of an aesthetic object may not be exhaustively\nrevealed in any particular presentation of it.\nA presentation may be veridical; that is, the characteristics of\nthe presentation may correspond to the characteristics of the\naesthetic object.\nA presentation may be illusory; that is, some of the\ncharacteristics of the presentation may fail to correspond to the\ncharacteristics of the aesthetic object.\nIf two presentations of the same aesthetic object have\nincompatible characteristics, at least one of them is illusory.\n(Aesth: 46, 48)\n\n\nTaking \u201caesthetic object\u201d to mean \u201cwork of\nart\u201d, the underlying ontology isn\u2019t a sense-datum ontology\nor a mixed-category ontology at all. Several of the\npostulates\u20142, 4, and 6; possibly 3 and 7\u2014are in fact\nprima facie incompatible with a sense-datum ontology. Rather,\nwhat 1\u20137 strongly suggest is that a work of art is a physical\nobject: it\u2019s perceptible, publicly or inter-subjectively\navailable in both time and space, can appear differently from\ndifferent points of view and at different times, may not be\nexhaustively understood on any given occasion, has properties that may\nbe correctly or incorrectly perceived, and is such that attributions\nto it obey the law of non-contradiction.\n\nNot surprisingly, after 1958 Beardsley\n\n\nmoved steadily in the direction of some form of non-reductive\nmaterialism, of seeing how far it is possible to go in treating\nartworks as physical objects.\u00a0(Aesth: xxiv)\n\n\nThe materialism is non-reductive\u00a0in that works of art have\nproperties that physical objects generally don\u2019t. Such\nmaterialism works well with \u201csingular\u201d works of art, such\nas paintings, Beardsley thinks, but \u201cmultiple\nartworks\u201d\u2014musical compositions which have many\nperformances, poems which exist in multiple printings\u2014present\nproblems. The musical composition isn\u2019t any single score or\nperformance, the poem any single printed text. For that reason,\nBeardsley once again is driven back in the direction of ontological\npluralism: perhaps works of art are either physical objects (the\nsingular works) or kinds of physical object (the multiple works), with\n\u201cphysical object\u201d construed broadly here so as to include\nevents (such as a dance). This position is only slightly more\neconomical than Beardsley\u2019s earlier one\u2014no works of art\nare ideas, which is good, since taking works of art to be ideas\ndoesn\u2019t fit in well with a number of his critical\npostulates\u2014and only slightly tidier\u2014essentially, the\nproliferation of ontological categories is limited by the broad but\nabstract concept of a kind.\n\nMost philosophers would be dissatisfied with such a disjoint ontology,\nand Beardsley was no exception. There are basically two ways to avoid\nit:\n\nsubsume physical objects under kinds;\nsubsume kinds under physical objects.\n\n\n(A third possibility is to subsume both under a broader, inclusive\ncategory. Absent a relatively revisionist ontology, however,\nit\u2019s hard to see what such a third category would be.) Both\nstrategies involve assigning primacy to one of the categories, but\neach requires that that be done in a way that does justice to what we\nsay and think about art.\n\nThe first proposal, to subsume physical objects under kinds, entails\nthat the Mona Lisa isn\u2019t a physical object but a kind\nof painting. One difficulty with this is that as a kind, the Mona\nLisa wouldn\u2019t have any perceptual properties, which is both\nstrange and in violation of Beardsley\u2019s critical postulates. A\nsecond difficulty is that it\u2019s a necessary truth\u2014or at\nleast many philosophers think it\u2019s a necessary truth\u2014that\nthere\u2019s only one Mona Lisa, yet the view in question\nentails that there could be many Mona Lisas, many instances\nof the kind.\n\nNeither objection is definitive, however. Although Beardsley discusses\nneither objection, the first can be deflated by noting that although,\nstrictly speaking, the Mona Lisa is a kind, it has perceptual\nproperties in that all of its instances do. In other words, since all\ninstances of the kind have perceptual properties, instances-of-a-kind\nare near enough to kinds to allow kinds to have perceptual properties\nin an extended sense of the term, by a small conceptual courtesy.\nThat\u2019s close enough for government work (as the saying goes).\nEven if this response is acceptable, however, the question of what the\nperceptual properties of the Mona Lisa are, if two of its\ninstances differ markedly in their perceptual properties (due, say, to\nexposure to sunlight), would remain an odd one. Not an unanswerable\none, however. That question and others like it could be answered by\ntaking the Mona Lisa to be, in effect, an etching, with the\nfirst of its instances as a reference point for others.\n\nThat reply, in fact, previews a response to the second objection.\nPerhaps it\u2019s simply a contingent, historical fact that we\ncan\u2019t create extremely accurate duplicates of paintings, and for\nthat reason attach great importance to first instances of\npainting-kinds. That may be why we\u2019re very reluctant to\nadmit\u2014reluctant to the point of thinking it\nimpossible\u2014that there could be more than one Mona\nLisa.\n\nEven if both objections can be rebutted, though, Beardsley is still\ninclined to reject the view that works of art are, all of them,\nkinds.\n\nHe\u2019s also inclined to reject the second view, that works of art\nare, all of them, physical objects. Though the topic isn\u2019t\npursued at length, his reasons center around the fact that many works\nof art\u2014woodcuts, for instance\u2014have multiple instances, and\nit\u2019s impossible to account for that fact if every work of art is\na physical object. Is Pastijn\u2019s The Last Supper in Rome\nor in Paris? If it\u2019s a physical object, it can\u2019t be in\nboth places, so which of the two is it? Since both \u201cParis\u201d\nand \u201cRome\u201d seem wrong, the correct thing to do is to\nreject the assumption that the woodcut is a physical object. Rather,\nit\u2019s a kind, and has instances that are located in Paris and\nRome.\n\nBut if that\u2019s enough to quell doubts about some works of art\nbeing kinds, it should also be enough, for the reasons mentioned two\nand three paragraphs back, to quell doubts about all works of art\nbeing kinds. The remaining barrier to the first reductive view, that\nworks of art are, all of them, kinds, would then be removed.\n\nOn the other hand, the overall argument could just as easily cut the\nother way. If it\u2019s physical objects that literally have\nperceptual properties, then why not take works of art, all of them, to\nbe physical objects, with kinds being granted the title in an extended\nsense of the term, by a small conceptual courtesy? As traditionally\ninterpreted, Aristotle holds that in the primary sense a substance is\nan individual, but in a secondary sense, by extension, a species is\nalso a substance. Why not say something similar about works of art?\nWhy not say, that, strictly speaking, works of art are physical\nobjects, but in a secondary sense, works of art are kinds?\n\nBeardsley doesn\u2019t pursue the issue to the lengths that it has\nbeen here, so it\u2019s impossible to know how he\u2019d respond to\nthe above. On the record, though, he embraces the untidy pluralism\nhe\u2019d rather avoid. Doing so doesn\u2019t especially bother him,\nhowever, as he doesn\u2019t think ontological questions as important\nas many other questions in aesthetics. \n",
