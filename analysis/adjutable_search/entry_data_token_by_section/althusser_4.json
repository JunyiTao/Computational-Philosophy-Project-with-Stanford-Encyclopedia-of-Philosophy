    "main_text": "Early Work (1946\u201360) || Marx not Hegel\n2.3 Marx not Hegel\n\nBy the early 1950s, Althusser\u2019s judgments that Marxism was, of\nnecessity, Hegelian and that it aimed at human fulfillment had\nundergone revision. This transition to thinking about Marx as the\noriginator of a philosophy totally distinct from Hegel\u2019s was\nsignaled in a review essay from 1950 which argued that the post-war\nmania for Hegel in France was only a bourgeois attempt to combat Marx.\nIn two short essays from 1953 on Marxist philosophy, this switch is\nfully apparent. In these texts, Althusser aligns himself with the\nposition advanced by Mehring and Lenin that, at a certain point in\nMarx\u2019s development, Hegel is left behind and that, afterwards,\nMarx forged his own original concepts and methodology. In his\ndescription of what these concepts and methodology are, Althusser\npretty much follows the Party line, insisting that Marx reversed the\nHegelian dialectic, that historical materialism is a science, that the\nsciences verify dialectical materialism, and that the proletariat\nneeds to be taught Marxist science from above. Though these essays\nrepeat the Party philosophy as formulated by Lenin, Stalin, and\nZhdanov, they also include recognizable Althusserian themes and show\nhis thinking about these themes to be in transition. For instance,\nboth essays retain the idea from Althusser\u2019s 1947 thesis about\nthe quasi-transcendental status of present scientific knowledge. Both\nalso anticipate future concerns in their speculations about the\nideological character of current scientific knowledge and in their\nincorporation of ideas from Mao about the relationship between theory\nand practice. Written as a response to Paul Ricoeur and representing\nthe last example of this third category of Althusser\u2019s early\nwork, a text from 1955 argues for the objectivity of historical\nscience. This is a theme to which he would return. Noticeably absent\nfrom this body of work, however, are the detailed and original claims\nAlthusser would make in the early 1960s about Marx\u2019s\nphilosophy.\n",
