    "main_text": "Zhang Xichun on Chinese Philosophy and Chinese Medicine\n4. Zhang Xichun on Chinese Philosophy and Chinese Medicine\n\n\nThe views of the physician Zhang Xichun (1860\u20131933) provide an\nimportant testimony to the complex relations between Chinese medicine\nand Chinese philosophy. Zhang\u2019s life coincided with the\ntransition of China from the Qing dynasty to the modern era, a period\nin which major Chinese intellectuals were preoccupied by questions of\nthe relative merits of indigenous philosophical and scientific\ntraditions as compared to foreign knowledge, especially of science and\nmedicine.\n\n\nThe medical context for these debates was the differences between\nChinese and Western medicine, and the best role for traditional Chinese\nmedicine in modern times. Zhang was a major contributor to these\ndebates. Zhang Xichun was trained by his father in traditional\nmedicine from youth, but he was also educated in the classics of\nChinese philosophy. He became a leading proponent of the\n\u201cschool of converging and connecting\u201d Chinese and Western\nmedicine (hui tong xue pai\n\u532f\u8855\u5b78\u6d3e. For the life of Zhang Xichun\nsee Scheid 1995, 5\u20136).\n\n\nZhang\u2019s book contains an essay explicitly titled \u201cConcerning\nThe Relation of Philosophy and Medicine.\u201d It is so central\nto the topic of this essay that it is worth quoting at length. \nZhang begins by remarking that recent (Chinese) medical journals accuse\ntraditional Chinese philosophy of holding back the progress of\nmedicine. He responds: \u201ctheir authors do not understand the\nuse of philosophy, nor do they understand that philosophy is actually\nthe basis of medicine.\u201d He quotes a passage from the Book\nof Songs (Shi jing) says: \u201che is intelligent and wise, and\nprotects his own person\u201d (Shi jing, \u201cZheng\nmin\u201d \u70dd\u6c11, Mao 260). The passage refers to a\ncertain Zhong Shanfu \u4ef2\u5c71\u752b, a virtuous minister of\nKing Xuan of Zhou (r. 827\u2013782 BCE). The point is that\n\u201cprotecting one\u2019s person means not only protecting oneself from\nattach by thieves or robbers but also protecting one\u2019s person from\nbeing beset by disease and illness. But, Zhang continues, the\npoint of the quotation is that people must possess an inherent aptitude\nfor intelligence and wisdom. They must also make a systematic\nstudy of wisdom and virtue, and only then can we protect our\npersons. \n\n\nHe next identifies the combination of inherent aptitude and\nsystematic study behind \u201dbeing intelligent and wise and\nprotecting one\u2019s own person\u201c with what the recluse-hermits of\nantiquity called \u201dthe dao of nurturing life (yang sheng zhi\ndao \u990a\u751f\u4e4b\u9053). In his view, the\nnurturing life (yang sheng) practices of antiquity are what we\nnow call philosophy.\n\n\nHe goes on to argue that those who had the benevolent disposition of\na junzi and themselves understood nurturing life practices wanted to\nenable others to be able to nurture their own lives. \nHowever, for people who do not use understanding and wisdom to protect\ntheir persons, the way of nurturing life was not sufficient, and they\nthemselves could not help falling ill: \u201ctherefore they\npromulgated the principles of philosophy and originated the disciplines\nof medicine and pharmacology (materia medica) in order to offer\nassistance to those who themselves were unable to engage in nurturing\nlife practices.\u201d \n\n\nHe then goes on to identify specific physicians with this derivation\nof medicine from philosophy, including Ge Hong, Tao Hongjing and Sun\nSimiao. All these great physicians, he argues, were really\nphilosophers who wrote important philosophical works.\n\n\nHe then turns to the Huang Di neijing, which begins with a\nchapter titled \u201cDiscourse on the True [Qi Endowed by] Heaven in\nHigh Antiquity\u201d (Shang Gu Tian Zhen Lun). It says:\n\u201cIn highest antiquity there were true men (zhen ren) who\nupheld [the patterns of] heaven and earth and grasped yin and yang,\nexhaled and inhaled essence qi (jing qi), stood alone\nand guarded their spirit (shen), and their muscles and flesh\nwere like one, and thus they were able to achieve longevity in\ncorrespondence with heaven and earth\u201d (Huang Di neijing\n1, trans. after Unschuld 2011, 42).\n\n\nZhang argues that, according to the neijing, these realized\npersons were able to use these techniques to transform their\ntemperament and disposition and to achieved achieve an infinite life\nexpectancy. He thus identifies a clear link from the realized\npersons of high antiquity to the great schools of Chinese philosophy\nthrough the methods and theories attributed to the Yellow Emperor.\n\n\nHis point is that, although the neijing is an exposition of\nmedicine: \u201cit necessarily begins with philosophy and takes\nphilosophy as the study of how to safeguard one\u2019s person. People\nmust first be able themselves to protect their own persons; only then\ncan they represent to others how to protect their persons. Taking\nphilosophy as the way to protect one\u2019s person, it is by means of the\nprinciples of philosophy that we are able to preserve our bodies by\ntransforming our qi. Taking medicine is the way to\nprotect other people\u2019s bodies, it is by first completely\nunderstanding the transformation of qi in one\u2019s own person that [the\nphysician] is able to represent to others how to adjust the\ntransformation of qi in their own bodies.\u201d He concludes:\n\u201cfrom this we understand that philosophy is the true source of\nmedicine, or rather that medicine is the natural outcome of philosophy.\nThis is why the Neijing states explicitly that the study of medicine\nmust start from philosophy.\u201d How, he concludes, could\nphilosophy obstruct medicine?
