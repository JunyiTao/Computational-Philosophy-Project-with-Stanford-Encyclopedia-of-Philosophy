How do we connect theory and data via observation\nand experimental and measuring techniques? The Semantic View\ndistinguishes theory individuation from both theory-phenomena and\ntheory-world relations. Three types of analysis of theory\ninterpretation are worth investigating: (i) a hierarchy of\nmodels (e.g., Suppes; Suppe), (ii) similarity (e.g.,\nGiere; Weisberg), and (iii) isomorphism (e.g., van Fraassen;\nFrench and Ladyman).\n3.3.1 A Hierarchy of Models\n\nOne way of analyzing theory structure interpretation is through a\nseries of models falling under the highest-level axiomatizations. This\nseries has been called \u201ca hierarchy of models,\u201d though it\nneed not be considered a nested hierarchy. These models include models\nof theory, models of experiment, and models of data (Suppes 1962,\n2002). Here is a summary of important parts of the hierarchy (Suppes\n1962, Table 1, 259; cf. Giere 2010, Figure 1, 270): \n\n Axioms of Theory. Axioms define set-theoretic\npredicates, and constitute the core structure of scientific theories,\nas reviewed in Section 3.1.2.\n Models of Theory. \u201cRepresentation Theorems,\u201d\npermit us \u201cto discover if an interesting subset of models for\nthe theory may be found such that any model for the theory is\nisomorphic to some member of this subset\u201d (Suppes 1957, 263).\nRepresentation theorem methodology can be extended (i) down the\nhierarchy, both to models of experiment and models of data, and (ii)\nfrom isomorphism to homomorphism (Suppes 2002, p. 57 ff.; Suppe 2000;\nCartwright 2008).\n Models of Experiment. Criteria of experimental design\nmotivate choices for how to set up and analyze experiments. There are\ncomplex mappings between models of experiment thus specified, and (i)\nmodels of theory, (ii) theories of measurement, and (iii) models of\ndata.\n Models of Data. In building models of data, phenomena\nare organized with respect to statistical goodness-of-fit tests and\nparameter estimation, in the context of models of theory. Choices\nabout which parameters to represent must be made.\n\n\nThe temptation to place phenomena at the bottom of the\nhierarchy must be resisted because phenomena permeate all levels.\nIndeed, the \u201cclass of phenomena\u201d pertinent to a scientific\ntheory is its \u201cintended scope\u201d (Suppe 1977, 223; Weisberg\n2013, 40). Furthermore, this temptation raises fundamental questions\nabout scientific representation: \u201cthere is the more profound\nissue of the relationship between the lower most representation in the\nhierarchy\u2014the data model perhaps\u2014and reality itself, but\nof course this is hardly something that the semantic approach alone\ncan be expected to address\u201d (French and Ladyman 1999, 113; cf.\nvan Fraassen 2008, 257\u2013258, \u201cThe \u2018link\u2019 to\nreality\u201d). Borrowing from David Chalmers, the \u201chard\nproblem\u201d of philosophy of science remains connecting abstract\nstructures to concrete phenomena, data, and world. \n3.3.2 Similarity\n\nThe similarity analysis of theory interpretation combines semantic and\npragmatic dimensions (Giere 1988, 2004, 2010; Giere, Bickle, and\nMauldin 2006; Weisberg 2013). According to Giere, interpretation is\nmediated by theoretical hypotheses positing representational relations\nbetween a model and relevant parts of the world. Such relations may be\nstated as follows: \n\n\\[\nS \\text{ uses } X \\text{ to represent } W \\text{ for purposes } P.\n\\]\n\n\nHere \\(S\\) is a scientist, research group or community, \\(W\\) is a\npart of the world, and \\(X\\) is, broadly speaking, any one of a\nvariety of models (Giere 2004, 743, 747, 2010). Model-world similarity\njudgments are conventional and intentional:\n\nNote that I am not saying that the model itself represents an aspect\nof the world because it is similar to that aspect. \u2026Anything is\nsimilar to anything else in countless respects, but not anything\nrepresents anything else. It is not the model that is doing the\nrepresenting; it is the scientist using the model who is doing the\nrepresenting. (2004, 747)\n\n\nRelatedly, Weisberg (2013) draws upon Tversky (1977) to develop a\nsimilarity metric for model interpretation (equation 8.10, 148). This\nmetric combines (i) model-target semantics (90\u201397), and (ii) the\npragmatics of \u201ccontext, conceptualization of the target, and the\ntheoretical goals of the scientist\u201d (149). Giere and Weisberg\nthus endorse an abundance of adequate mapping relations between a\ngiven model and the world. From this diversity, scientists and\nscientific communities must select particularly useful similarity\nrelationships for contextual modeling purposes. Because of semantic\npluralism and irreducible intentionality, this similarity analysis of\ntheory interpretation cannot be accommodated within a hierarchy of\nmodels approach, interpreted as a neat model nesting based on\npre-given semantic relations among models at different levels.\n3.3.3 Isomorphism\n\nThe term \u201cisomorphism\u201d is a composite of the Greek words\nfor \u201cequal\u201d and \u201cshape\u201d or \u201cform.\u201d\nIndeed, in mathematics, isomorphism is a perfect one-to-one, bijective\nmapping between two structures or sets. Figure (2) literally and\nfiguratively captures the term:\n\n\n\nFigure 2.\n\n\nEspecially in set theory, category theory, algebra, and topology,\nthere are various kinds of \u201c-morphisms,\u201d viz., of mapping\nrelations between two structures or models. Figure\n(3) indicates five different kinds of homomorphism, arranged in a Venn\ndiagram.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.\n\n\nAlthough philosophers have focused on isomorphism, other morphisms\nsuch as monomorphism (i.e., an injective homomorphism where some\nelements in the co-domain remain unmapped from the domain) might also\nbe interesting to investigate, especially for embedding data (i.e.,\nthe domain) into rich theoretical structures (i.e., the co-domain). To\ncomplete the visualization above, an epimorphism is a surjective\nhomomorphism, and an endomorphism is a mapping from a structure to\nitself, although it need not be a symmetrical\u2014i.e.,\ninvertible\u2014mapping, which would be an automorph. \n\nPerhaps the most avid supporter of isomorphism and embedding as the\nway to understand theory interpretation is van Fraassen. In a\nnutshell, if we distinguish (i) theoretical models, (ii)\n\u201cempirical substructures\u201d (van Fraassen 1980, 64, 1989,\n227; alternatively: \u201csurface models\u201d 2008, 168), and (iii)\n\u201cobservable phenomena\u201d (1989, 227, 2008, 168), then, van\nFraassen argues, theory interpretation is a relation of isomorphism\nbetween observable phenomena and empirical substructures, which are\nthemselves isomorphic with one or more theoretical models.\nMoreover, if a relation of isomorphism holds between \\(X\\) and a\nricher \\(Y\\), we say that we have embedded \\(X\\) in \\(Y\\). For\ninstance, with respect to the seven-point geometry above (Figure 1),\nvan Fraassen contends that isomorphism gives embeddability, and that\nthe relation of isomorphism \u201cis important because it is also the\nexact relation a phenomenon bears to some model or theory, if that\ntheory is empirically adequate\u201d (1989, 219\u201320; this kind\nof statement seems to be simultaneously descriptive and prescriptive\nabout scientific representation, see Section 1.1 above). In The\nScientific Image he is even clearer about fleshing out the\nempirical adequacy of a theory (with its theoretical models) in terms\nof isomorphism between \u201cappearances\u201d (i.e., \u201cthe\nstructures which can be described in experimental and measurement\nreports,\u201d 1980, 64, italics removed) and empirical\nsubstructures. Speaking metaphorically,\n\nthe phenomena are, from a theoretical point of view, small, arbitrary,\nand chaotic\u2014even nasty, brutish, and short\u2026\u2014but can\nbe understood as embeddable in beautifully simple but much larger\nmathematical models. (2008, 247; see also van Fraassen 1981, 666 and\n1989, 230)\n\n\nInterestingly, and as a defender of an identity strategy (see\nConclusion), Friedman also appeals to embedding and subsumption\nrelations between theory and phenomena in his analyses of theory\ninterpretation (Friedman 1981, 1983).\nBueno, da Costa, French, and Ladyman also employ embedding and\n(partial) isomorphism in the empirical interpretation of partial\nstructures (Bueno 1997; Bueno, French, and Ladyman 2012; da Costa and\nFrench 1990, 2003; French 2017; French and Ladyman 1997, 1999, 2003;\nLadyman 2004). Su\u00e1rez discusses complexities in van\nFraassen\u2019s analyses of scientific representation and theory\ninterpretation (Su\u00e1rez 1999, 2011). On the one hand,\nrepresentation is structural identity between the theoretical and the\nempirical. On the other hand, \u201cThere is no representation except\nin the sense that some things are used, made, or taken, to represent\nsome things as thus or so\u201d (van Fraassen 2008, 23, italics\nremoved). The reader interested in learning how van Fraassen\nsimultaneously endorses acontextually structural and contextually\npragmatic aspects of representation and interpretation should refer to\nvan Fraassen\u2019s (2008) investigations of maps and \u201cthe\nessential indexical.\u201d [To complement the structure vs. function\ndistinction, see van Fraassen 2008, 309\u2013311 for a structure\n(\u201cstructural relations\u201d) vs. history (\u201cthe\nintellectual processes that lead to those models\u201d) distinction;\ncf. Ladyman et al. 2011] In all of this, embedding via isomorphism is\na clear contender for theory interpretation under the Semantic\nView.\n",
