    "main_text": "Freedom of conscience || Freedom of conscience and conscientious objection today\n7. Conclusion\n\nThere is no such a thing as the notion of conscience, both in\na philosophical and in a psychological sense. As we have seen, the\nconcept of conscience has been given different interpretations\nthroughout history, sometimes on the basis of underlying systematic\nphilosophical theories of the mind and of morality, and sometimes\nserving religious or political purposes.\n\nThis lack of uniformity is not only a problem for historians and\ntheoretical philosophers. Because it cannot be immediately clear what\nwe are talking about when we talk of conscience, of freedom of\nconscience, or of conscientious objection, it is important that\nclarity is made every time conscience is appealed to in different\nbranches of applied philosophy (particularly medical ethics) and in\npublic debates alike.\n\nThis entry has presented a conceptual map, rather than a historical\naccount, of conscience, which can provide some guidance for those\nengaged in this clarificatory task. One of the benefits of clarifying\nconcepts, and clarifying them in the different circumstances in which\nthey are used, is their subsequent demystification.\n\nConscience needs to be demystified, since it is one of those concepts\nthat tend to elicit reverence rather than questions or an interest in\nfurther inquiry. As seen above, appeals to conscience often replace\nreason giving and are made with the expectation that no further reason\nfor one\u2019s decisions and positions is requested. This attitude is\nalso displayed in many legislative approaches dealing with the notion\nof conscience; in particular, legislations about conscientious\nobjection in health care typically grant doctors a right to object to\nperforming certain professional activities (e.g., conscientious\nobjection to abortion) without requiring them to provide reasons for\ntheir objection, let alone submitting reasons to some form of\nassessment.\n\nThis entry has distinguished four main understandings of conscience,\ndrawing on the philosophical tradition of the concept. Whether the\nconcept is to be understood as a faculty for self-knowledge and\nself-assessment, or as having an epistemic function in the sphere of\nmorality, or as a motivational force, or again as a set of\nself-identifying moral beliefs, or a combination of any of these\ncharacterizations, it is important to have clear in mind what exactly\nwe are talking about when we talk of conscience and of freedom of\nconscience in each circumstance.\n\nFar from being a conversation-stopper, conscience can only find its\nproper place in philosophical and in public discussion if its\nphilosophical and psychological aspects are teased out, defined and\nassessed. Appeals to conscience can only be part of philosophical,\npolitical, and legal discussion if they are seen as the start, not the\nend of discussions.\n",
