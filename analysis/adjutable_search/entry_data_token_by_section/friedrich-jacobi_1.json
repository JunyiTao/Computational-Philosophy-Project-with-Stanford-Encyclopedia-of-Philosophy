    "main_text": "Early Writings\n2. Early Writings\n\nFrom his occasional writings, Jacobi might seem to be an engaged\nintellectual with some proclivity to disputing the tenets of the\nEnlightenment. His \u2018Discours pr\u00e9liminaire zu Le\nNoble\u2019 (1771) already hints at some of the ideas that he later\ndeveloped in his polemical writings, such as in his 1782 article\n\u2018Etwas dass Lessing gesagt hat\u2019, which presents the\ndespotism of the Medieval popes as preferable to that of enlightened\nprinces. Regardless, Jacobi did not agree with any authoritarian use\nof the political power, as shown in his 1781 essay \u2018\u00dcber\nRecht und Gewalt, oder philosophische Erw\u00e4gung eines Aufsatzes\nvon dem Herrn Hofrath Wieland \u00fcber das g\u00f6ttliche Recht der\nObrigkeit\u2019. In this text Jacobi publicly denies Wieland\u2019s\nclaim that right comes from the ability to impose obedience through\nthe use of force.\n\nApart from these minor texts and two political essays published in\n1779 (\u2018Eine politische Rhapsodie. Aus einem Aktenstock\nentwendet. Ein eingesandtes St\u00fcck\u2019 and \u2018Noch eine\npolitische Rhapsodie, worinn sich verschiedene Plagia befinden;\nbetitelt: Es ist nicht recht, und es ist nicht klug\u2019), in the\nsecond half of the 1770s, Jacobi gained momentum toward earning a\nwider audience, thanks to the publication of his two novels. Much in\ndebt to Goethe\u2019s blessing, which he had received during their\nfirst meeting in 1774, Jacobi eventually provides a definite form to\nhis internal unrest concerning the existence of a personal God, the\nendlessness of time, and the reasons for his ineffable and yet\nvisceral fervor.\n\nThe \u2018Eduard Allwills Papiere\u2019 is an epistolary novel and\nfirst published in 1775 in the journal Iris, which was led by\nJacobi\u2019s brother Johann Georg. This initial edition included\nonly five of the 21 letters that made up the final novel. A second\nedition appeared in 1776 in the journal Teutscher Merkur,\nincluding seven more letters, plus one more that did not appear in the\nfinal edition. A third edition, which was published in 1781, presented\nminor changes and additions. The fourth edition, published in 1792,\ncontains major changes (for instance, here we can find the details of\nJacobi\u2019s criticism of idealism), as well as an important\nsupplement, the letter \u2018An Erhard O**\u2019, which provides\nclear insight into Jacobi\u2019s definition of the human being. In\nthis edition, we can see how much the \u2018Spinoza Briefen\u2019\nand the \u2018David Hume Dialogue\u2019, published during the 1780s,\ninfluenced the content of the novel. The fifth and final edition,\npublished in 1812, does not differ much from the fourth. In this\nnovel, Jacobi blames the idea of the moral genius, as embodied by\nAllwill, and takes distance from the movement of the\nEmpfindsamkeit and Sturm und Drang (Ivaldo, 2003:\n31). Allwill is dominated by a limitless will (to will all), as will\nis everything he is (all is will): he rejects law and truth, making\nhis own determination the only right. While Allwill approaches\nJacobi\u2019s own tendency toward a repudiation of a pharisaic\nformality of life, Allwill makes the mistake of considering himself to\nbe the origin of morality, laws, and values. Thus, Jacobi seems to\npraise him for prioritizing his own inner moral impulse but condemns\nhim for dismissing the universal rationality that an inner moral\nimpulse must reveal.\n\n\u2018Woldemar. Eine Seltenheit aus der Naturgeschichte\u2019\nappeared in the Teutscher Merkur in 1777 in the form of a\nfragment with the title \u2018Freundschaft und Liebe. Eine wahre\nGeschichte, von der Herausgeber von Eduard Allwills Papiere\u2019. In\na more elaborate form, it is published in 1779, with the title\n\u2018Woldemar. Eine Seltenheit aus der Naturgeschichte\u2019. In\n1779, the philosophical part of the novel is published in the journal\nDeutsches Museum, under the title \u2018Ein St\u00fcck\nPhilosophie des Lebens und der Menschheit: Aus dem zweiten Bande von\nWoldemar\u2019. It is published again in 1781 with minor changes and\nunder the title \u2018Der Kunstgarten. Ein philosophisches\nGespr\u00e4ch\u2019. In 1794, after Jacobi has published all of his\nmajor philosophical texts, he publishes a new edition of\n\u2018Woldemar\u2019, including an analysis of Aristotle\u2019s\nethics and providing a different conclusion. This version is\neventually included in Jacobi\u2019s Complete Works in 1821. The text\nintroduces the figure of Woldemar, a passionate young man, melancholic\nand impulsive, who will discover that his beautiful soul must\nbe amended through the recognition of higher values and universal\nlaws. Unlike Allwill, Woldemar eventually understands that those\nuniversal values do not exclude the needs of his inner self; instead,\nthey bring his desires and passions to a higher, less egoistic\nperspective on friendship and affection. This new ethical horizon\nheals Woldemar\u2019s suffering and proves to be the only means of\nattaining real love.\n",
