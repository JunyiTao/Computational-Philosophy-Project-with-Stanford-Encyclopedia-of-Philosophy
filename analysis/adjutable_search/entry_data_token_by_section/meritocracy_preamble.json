    "main_text": "\n\nUnderstood literally, a meritocracy is a society in which influence\n(of some sort) is possessed on the basis of merit (whatever that\nmeans). Meritocracy is of perennial interest and has shaped\u2014for\ngood or ill\u2014political, economic, and cultural life in the East\nand the West. Yet meritocracy has received little direct philosophical\nattention. As David Miller puts it,\n\n\nwe don\u2019t have a clear understanding of what meritocracy means,\nso we don\u2019t have a proper measuring rod against which to gauge\nsocial realities, saying how far they do or do not conform to\nmeritocratic criteria. (1999: 178)\n\n\nAnd Amartya Sen:\n\n\nThe idea of meritocracy may have many virtues, but clarity is not one\nof them. (2000: 5)\n\n\nThis entry explains how philosophers (and others) have developed\nrecognizably meritocratic ideas and summarizes the philosophical\nstate-of-the-art. Throughout the entry, important lacunae in the\nliterature are pointed out. Despite its long history, meritocracy\nremains ripe for philosophical study.\n",
