    "main_text": "Demonstration || Division of the Sciences\n6.5 Division of the Sciences\n\nAvicenna\u2019s classification (or division) of the sciences is a\nnatural complement to his treatment of per se as well as being one of the\nmost innovative attempts to develop systematically the material on the subordination of scientific disciplines in Posterior Analytics A7, A9,\nand A13. It is also important for an historical reason.\nAvicenna\u2019s account of the division of the sciences is in fact\nthe only part of his Burh\u0101n that actually had a direct\nimpact on the Western Latin tradition.\n\nThe source of Avicenna\u2019s classification is a chapter from his\nBurh\u0101n famously translated and encapsulated by the\ntwelfth-century Toledan philosopher and translator Dominicus\nGundissalinus (ca. 1110\u20131190) in his De divisione philosophiae. In the first\npart, Avicenna presents a basic classification of the types of\nhierarchical relations holding between various pairs of sciences, based on the corresponding\nrelations holding between their underlying subjects. At the root of the division\nis a distinction between sciences that differ because (a) they have\ntwo distinct subjects or (b) because they treat one and the same\nsubject in different ways. He articulates in full the\nprimary divisions of scientific domains, offering an analysis and\ncategorization of basic types of relations and dependencies (most notably, parthood\nand subordination). In the second part, Avicenna develops a complementary classification\nof the criteria of identity and distinctness for the sciences focusing\non the ways in which sciences may have elements in common. In this context, he addresses\nthe question from a different perspective\u2014that of the canonical\nthree elements of an Aristotelian science\u2014including not only the\nsubjects, but also scientific principles and questions (mas\u0101\u02beil), i.e., the\nconclusions of scientific syllogisms (the theorems of a science).\n\nThe use of three fundamental criteria\u2014subject/genus\n(maw\u1e0d\u016b\u02bf/\u011fins), principles\n(mab\u0101di\u02be), and per se attributes\n(\u02bfaw\u0101ri\u1e0d \u1e0f\u0101tiyya)\u2014to\ndetermine identity, overlap, or distinctness between domains of\nscientific inquiry is in line with Aristotelian orthodoxy. But\nAvicenna takes the criteria to a whole different level and articulates\na complex network of relations of superordination and subordination\nwhereby scientific knowledge is rigidly organized in hierarchical\nstructures that reflect underlying ontological relations between their\nobjects and attributes. For a detailed account see (Hugonnard-Roche 1988) and (Strobino 2017).\n",
