    "main_text": "\n\nIn almost all our activities, we engage with other people, usually in\npersistent connections or associations that vary according to our\npurposes. We have foundational associative experiences within our\nfamilies; formative years of schooling with peers and teachers;\nworkplace links with bosses, employees, and colleagues with whom we\nshare at least corridors, carpet, and resources; and connections with\nlike-minded companions, such as fellow hobbyists, devotees, friends,\nor union members.\n\nSome of our associations are voluntary, such as a typical friendship.\nOthers are non-voluntary, such as the childhood family or\ninstitutional environment in which we are born and raised. Some of our\nassociations offer lasting connections with specific people, such as,\nusually, our parents, children, spouses, and colleagues. Others are\nlooser affiliations with people we may not know directly, based on\ncommon identity, history, or ambition, such as a national club, a\nstudent union, the \u201cRepublican base\u201d, the \u201cAmerican\npeople\u201d, the Jewish community, and Christians. Some of these\nlatter affiliations stretch the notion of an association into\na metaphor, but they highlight that associations are defined by people\nhaving a common purpose. That common purpose is sometimes the\nassociation itself: many of our intimate associations exist for their\nown sake, that is, for the sake of associating with one another. Other\ntimes, the common purpose is a further, independent goal, such as\nfinancial success, worship, recreation, achievement, joint\nself-expression, or political control.\n\nThis entry surveys several philosophical debates about the nature,\nscope, and value of our freedom to associate with other people in\nthese different ways as well as our freedom to dissociate both from\nparticular people and from people in general. Key questions concern,\nfirst, our degree of freedom to decide who is in and who is out: When\nmay we refuse to associate with other people? When may we leave the\nassociations we are in? When may we deny someone membership in our\nassociation? When may third-parties, such as the state, sever, compel,\nor intrude upon our associations? Second, key questions concern our\ndegree of freedom to decide what to do as associates: What level of\ncontrol should we have over the internal workings of our associations,\nespecially if those workings harm either members or non-members? To\nwhat extent may we radically reshape, and thereby redefine, the\nassociations we are in?\n\nThe answers to these two sets of questions will provide a unifying\nanalysis of the vast and seemingly disparate array of associations to\nwhich we can belong. The analysis will explore the phenomenology of\ndifferent kinds of associations, from the intimate world of family\nlife to the detached relations among strangers that define\ncitizenship. The analysis will assess the meaning, function, and value\nof freedom of association within this comprehensive image of\nassociative life.\n\nThere are several different frameworks through which to assess the\nvalue of association and freedom of association. Kantians would\nemphasize the importance of securing equal external freedom for\nindividual citizens, something which the state can help to secure by\nhindering those who would hinder others\u2019 freedom. Rawlsians\nwould highlight that freedom of association, like other basic rights\nand liberties, has a certain priority in political reasoning and\ncannot easily be defeated by countervailing considerations (Quong\n2011: 15; cf. Moles 2014: 85\u2013103). In a Rawlsian framework, the\nscope and limits of freedom of association are justified with\nreference to what we need in order to develop and exercise what Rawls\ncalls the two moral powers (which are, first, the capacity\nfor a sense of justice and, second, the capacity for a conception of\nthe good) (Rawls 1993: 19\u201320). This entry will take a broader\nview of freedom of association, focusing on the diverse range of\nassociations we can have, and highlighting, specifically, the array of\nsocial goods that our associations can make available to us.\n\nThis entry begins with a taxonomy of different ways of associating and\nthe related phenomena of interacting and assembling\n (\u00a71).\n It then elucidates the general apparatus of rights, duties, and\nfreedoms that underpin different associative contexts\n (\u00a72)\n before homing in on three rights in particular\u2014the right to\nexclude\n (\u00a73),\n the right to exit\n (\u00a74),\n and the right to organizational autonomy\n (\u00a75;\n White 2013)\u2014distinguishing between the rights of individuals\nvis-\u00e0-vis groups, and the rights of groups\nqua groups. The entry connects individuals\u2019 associative\nrights to other rights that contain associative aspects, such as\nfreedom of expression and freedom of religion. The entry discusses\ngroups\u2019 associative rights in relation to kindred, collective,\nand national freedoms, such as national self-governance and\nimmigration control, exploring how these latter freedoms connect to\nthe wider framework of associative freedom. Examining states\u2019\nrights to exclude and self-govern is necessary here since some\nphilosophers invoke a parallel between individuals\u2019 associative\nfreedoms and states\u2019 rights in order to defend comprehensive\nstate rights to exclude. The entry also assesses the importance of\nassociative freedom relative both to competing rights (such as\npositive rights to inclusion, care, and companionship) and other\nvalues (such as equality and state interests).\n",
