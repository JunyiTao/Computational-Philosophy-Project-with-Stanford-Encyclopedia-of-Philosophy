So while a rationally ideal\nagent\u2019s higher-order evidence would have no effect on her\nfirst-order beliefs, a non-ideal agent\u2019s evidence should have\nsuch an effect\u2014precisely because she is non-ideal.\n\nJoshua DiPaolo (2019) develops one version of this view. Drawing on\nwork in political philosophy, he argues that we need an\nepistemological \u201ctheory of the second best\u201d. On his\nproposed view, the norms that apply to ideal agents are different from\nthe norms that apply to non-ideal agents. While the ideal norms define\na standard of perfection for all of us, non-ideal norms tell us how to\napproach that standard, taking our imperfections into account. DiPaolo\nargues that this approach allows us to resolve the apparent tensions\ninvolved in accommodating higher-order evidence: ideal rationality\nrequires ignoring higher-order evidence, but non-ideal rationality\nrequires respecting it.\n\nWhile non-ideal agents are limited in their reasoning abilities, they\nare also limited in their abilities to double-check and\n\u201cpolice\u201d themselves. Appealing to this consideration,\nJoshua Schechter (2013) makes a suggestion that cuts in the opposite\ndirection from DiPaolo\u2019s: he argues that perhaps our epistemic\nimperfections cap our responsibility to respond to higher-order\nevidence. This means that while our available evidence may call for\nextensive belief revision\u2014and while a more ideal agent\nwould revise her beliefs in response to higher-order\nevidence\u2014non-ideal believers like us are permitted to stop when\nwe\u2019ve done what we can.\n\nDeclan Smithies (2019) also defends a view on which the\nideal/non-ideal distinction comes into play. This is discussed in more\ndetail below.\n",
