Comparative Cognition and AI\n\nThere has been a large amount of collaborative work between\ncomparative cognition and artificial intelligence (AI) research over\nthe past decade. On the one hand, formal models developed in AI can be\nused to predict and explain animal behavior in ways that move beyond\nfolk psychological accounts. On the other hand, the methods of\ncomparative cognition are well placed to inform AI research, given the\ndiversity of behavior and information-processing abilities found\nacross the tree of life. We\u2019ll consider both aspects here, while\nalso highlighting why animal-AI inferences should be handled with\ncare.\n\nColin Allen (2014) argues that comparative cognition would benefit\ngreatly from developing mathematically rigorous formal models. As we\nhave seen throughout this entry, comparative cognition researchers\noften rely on intuitive, natural language concepts for constructing\naccounts of animal minds like causal reasoning, mental time travel,\nimagination, and self-recognition (see Schnell et al. 2021b).\nRegarding this approach Allen (2014) writes:\n\n\nThe conceptual framework guiding most work in comparative animal\ncognition (whether by ethologists or psychologists) is insufficiently\nformalized to support rigorous science in the long run. (2014: 82)\n\n\nOne concern with more formal approaches, however, is that they will\nfail to \u201cscale up\u201d to predict and explain the behavioral\nphenomenon that are of interest to many comparative cognition\nresearchers, such as natural social and physical interactions. Work in\nAI is starting to show that there are ways of closing this gap,\nhowever. For example, Peter Battaglia and colleagues advance a\nformalized mental model in the form of an \u201cintuitive physics\nengine\u201d (IPE) analogous to the machine physics engines used in\ninteractive video games (Battaglia, Hamrick, & Tenenbaum. 2013,\nsee also Ullman et al. 2017). The IPE is probabilistic and\noversimplifies the nature of objects, such as their geometry and mass\ndensity distribution, but has been developed to explain how people\nquickly make inferences about physical scenes in a dynamic and noisy\nworld. Battaglia and colleagues found that this formal model does\nindeed capture people\u2019s intuitions and prediction about physical\nscenes (such as \u201cwill this tower of blocks fall?\u201d) across\na wide range of complex and novel scenarios. Moreover, the model\ncaptures not just successful predictions, but also other signatures of\nhuman judgment like illusions and biases (see\n section 3.4).\n\nThe above work uses AI to explain human cognition and behavior.\nHowever, such methods are also being applied to nonhuman animals. For\nexample, much of contemporary AI depends on the tools of reinforcement\nlearning (RL). These techniques involve linking states of the\nenvironment and an agent\u2019s actions in such a way that allows the\nagent to maximize future rewards. The tools of RL were originally\ninspired by animal learning research (Hassabis et al. 2017); however,\nthey have since been developed by AI researchers in ways that allow\nfresh insights into animal behavior. For example, the\ntemporal-difference (TD) model has been used to explain a wide range\nof results from animal classical conditioning studies (see Sutton\n& Barto 1998: chapter 14). Similarly, Buckner (2018) draws on work\non Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) to explain the\nrelationship between sensory experience and representations of\nabstract categories in humans and animals\u2014a longstanding\nquestion in philosophy of mind. Halina (2021b) also shows how one can\nunderstand aspects of animal insightful problem solving (namely,\nmental scenario building) through Monte Carlo tree search. Finally,\nBohn et al. (2022) advance a Bayesian computational model of great ape\ncommunication, which they show accurately predicts the communicative\ninteractions of real-world chimpanzees living semi-wild in the\nChimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage in Zambia. These are a few examples of\nresearchers drawing on AI for formal models that can be successfully\napplied to capture animal minds and behavior (see also van der Vaart\net al. 2012).\n\nA major aim of AI research has been to build machines that\n\u201clearn and think like people\u201d (Lake et al. 2017).\nCurrently, there are many AI systems that match or exceed humans on\nvarious tasks, like the ability to play Chess and Go, and even make\nscientific discoveries (Shevlin et al. 2019). However, how to build a\nmachine with domain-general intelligence or \u201ccommon sense\u201d\nremains elusive. This challenge has led some researchers to argue that\nanimal cognition research offers the best path towards building\nthinking machines. Animals exhibit many of the \u201cbuilding\nblocks\u201d of human common sense, such as an understanding of\nobjects and their affordances, space, and causality (Shanahan et al.\n2020). Through the application of RL techniques, it is also possible\nto train artificial agents in 3D virtual environments analogous to the\nreal world. Using this approach, one can combine different RL\narchitectures and training environments with the aim of encouraging\nthe development of domain-general abilities. As Murray Shanahan and\ncolleagues write,\n\n\nanimal cognition supplies a compendium of well understood,\nnonlinguistic, intelligent behaviour; it suggests experimental methods\nfor evaluation and benchmarking; and it can guide environment and task\ndesign. (2020: 863; see also Crosby 2020)\n\n\nWork such as this is already underway. For example, the Animal-AI\nTestbed applies experimental protocols developed in comparative\ncognition to test AI (Crosby, Beyret, & Halina 2019; Crosby,\nBeyret et al. 2020). In 2019, the testbed included 300 tasks grouped\ninto 12 categories such as spatial elimination, delayed gratification,\nnumerosity, and tool use tasks. Konstantinos Voudouris and colleagues\n(2022) compared AI performance on this testbed with children aged\n6\u201310. They found that children and AIs performed similarly on\nbasic navigational tasks, but that children outperformed AIs on more\ncomplex tasks like object permanence and detour tasks.\n\nThere is much to be gained from animal-AI comparisons. Such work may\nrepresent the beginning of a transformation in the field of\ncomparative cognition\u2014one that brings artificial systems into\nthe fold. It may also lead to the development of cognitive models that\nbridge the gap between intuitive accounts of capacities like\nimagination and causal reasoning on the one hand, and mathematical and\ncomputational models on the other. However, when applying \u201crich\npsychological concepts\u201d like awareness, episodic memory, and\ntheory of mind to AI, one should also proceed with caution (Shevlin\n& Halina 2019). Some such concepts have normative dimensions, for\nexample, indicating a potential moral agent or moral patient. These\nnormative dimensions are important to acknowledge before adopting a\nterm in the context of AI, particularly if that term is used\ndifferently in the two contexts. AI findings may also dramatically\nalter our understanding of some cognitive capacities. Rather than\nadopting existing cognitive concepts, it may be fruitful in some cases\nto develop a radically new approach in the context of AI. If\nsuccessful, such an approach could then be imported into comparative\ncognition and potentially revolutionize our understanding of animal\nminds. \n",
