    "main_text": "Globalization in Contemporary Social Theory\n3. The Normative Challenges of Globalization\n\nThe wide-ranging impact of globalization on human existence means that\nit necessarily touches on many basic philosophical and\npolitical-theoretical questions. At a minimum, globalization suggests\nthat academic philosophers in the rich countries of the West should\npay closer attention to the neglected voices and intellectual\ntraditions of peoples with whom our fate is intertwined in ever more\nintimate ways (Dallmayr 1998). In this section, however, we focus\nexclusively on the immediate challenges posed by globalization to\nnormative political theory.\n\nWestern political theory has traditionally presupposed the existence\nof territorially bound communities, whose borders can be more or less\nneatly delineated from those of other communities. In this vein, the\ninfluential liberal political philosopher John Rawls described bounded\ncommunities whose fundamental structure consisted of\n\u201cself-sufficient schemes of cooperation for all the essential\npurposes of human life\u201d (Rawls 1993, 301). Although political\nand legal thinkers historically have exerted substantial energy in\nformulating defensible normative models of relations between states\n(Nardin and Mapel 1992), like Rawls they typically have relied on a\nclear delineation of \u201cdomestic\u201d from \u201cforeign\u201d\naffairs. In addition, they have often argued that the domestic arena\nrepresents a normatively privileged site, since fundamental normative\nideals and principles (for example, liberty or justice) are more\nlikely to be successfully realized in the domestic arena than in\nrelations among states. According to one influential strand within\ninternational relations theory, relations between states are\nmore-or-less lawless. Since the achievement of justice or democracy,\nfor example, presupposes an effective political sovereign, the lacuna\nof sovereignty at the global level means that justice and democracy\nare necessarily incomplete and probably unattainable there. In this\nconventional realist view of international politics, core features of\nthe modern system of sovereign states relegate the pursuit of western\npolitical thought\u2019s most noble normative goals primarily to the\ndomestic arena (Mearsheimer 2003.) Significantly, some prominent\nmid-century proponents of international realism rejected this\nposition\u2019s deep hostility to international law and supranational\npolitical organization, in part because they presciently confronted\nchallenges that we now typically associate with intensified\nglobalization (Scheuerman 2011).\n\nGlobalization poses a fundamental challenge to each of these\ntraditional assumptions. It is no longer self-evident that\nnation-states can be described as \u201cself-sufficient schemes of\ncooperation for all the essential purposes of human life\u201d in the\ncontext of intense deterritorialization and the spread and\nintensification of social relations across borders. The idea of a\nbounded community seems suspect given recent shifts in the\nspatio-temporal contours of human life. Even the most powerful and\nprivileged political units are now subject to increasingly\ndeterritorialized activities (for example, global financial markets or\ndigitalized mass communication) over which they have limited control,\nand they find themselves nested in webs of social relations whose\nscope explodes the confines of national borders. Of course, in much of\nhuman history social relations have transcended existing political\ndivides. However, globalization implies a profound quantitative\nincrease in and intensification of social relations of this type.\nWhile attempts to offer a clear delineation of the\n\u201cdomestic\u201d from the \u201cforeign\u201d probably made\nsense at an earlier juncture in history, this distinction no longer\naccords with core developmental trends in many arenas of social\nactivity. As the possibility of a clear division between domestic and\nforeign affairs dissipates, the traditional tendency to picture the\ndomestic arena as a privileged site for the realization of normative\nideals and principles becomes problematic as well. As an empirical\nmatter, the decay of the domestic-foreign frontier seems highly\nambivalent, since it might easily pave the way for the decay of the\nmore attractive attributes of domestic political life: as\n\u201cforeign\u201d affairs collapse inward onto\n\u201cdomestic\u201d political life, the insufficiently lawful\ncontours of the former make disturbing inroads onto the latter\n(Scheuerman 2004). As a normative matter, however, the disintegration\nof the domestic-foreign divide probably calls for us to consider, to a\ngreater extent than ever before, how our fundamental normative\ncommitments about political life can be effectively achieved on a\nglobal scale. If we take the principles of justice or democracy\nseriously, for example, it is no longer self-evident that the domestic\narena is the exclusive or perhaps even main site for their pursuit,\nsince domestic and foreign affairs are now deeply and irrevocably\nintermeshed. In a globalizing world, the lack of democracy or justice\nin the global setting necessarily impacts deeply on the pursuit of\njustice or democracy at home. Indeed, it may no longer be possible to\nachieve our normative ideals at home without undertaking to do so\ntransnationally as well.\n\nTo claim, for example, that questions of distributive justice have no\nstanding in the making of foreign affairs represents at best empirical\nnaivete about economic globalization. At worst, it constitutes a\ndisingenuous refusal to grapple with the fact that the material\nexistence of those fortunate enough to live in the rich countries is\ninextricably tied to the material status of the vast majority of\nhumanity residing in poor and underdeveloped regions. Growing material\ninequality spawned by economic globalization is linked to growing\ndomestic material inequality in the rich democracies (Falk 1999; Pogge\n2002). Similarly, in the context of global warming and the destruction\nof the ozone layer, a dogmatic insistence on the sanctity of national\nsovereignty risks constituting a cynical fig leaf for irresponsible\nactivities whose impact extends well beyond the borders of those\ncountries most directly responsible. Global warming and\nozone-depletion cry out for ambitious forms of transnational\ncooperation and regulation, and the refusal by the rich democracies to\naccept this necessity implies a failure to take the process of\nglobalization seriously when doing so conflicts with their immediate\nmaterial interests. Although it might initially seem to be\nillustrative of clever Realpolitik on the part of the\nculpable nations to ward off strict cross-border environmental\nregulation, their stubbornness is probably short-sighted: global\nwarming and ozone depletion will affect the children of Americans who\ndrive gas-guzzling SUVs or use environmentally unsound\nair-conditioning as well as the future generations of South Africa or\nAfghanistan (Cerutti 2007). If we keep in mind that environmental\ndegradation probably impacts negatively on democratic politics (for\nexample, by undermining its legitimacy and stability), the failure to\npursue effective transnational environmental regulation potentially\nundermines democracy at home as well as abroad.\n\nPhilosophers and political theorists have eagerly addressed the\nnormative and political implications of our globalizing world. A\nlively debate about the possibility of achieving justice at the global\nlevel pits representatives of cosmopolitanism against myriad\ncommunitarians, nationalists, realists, and others who privilege the\nnation-state and moral, political, and social ties resting on it\n(Lieven 2020; Tamir 2019). In contrast, cosmopolitans tend to\nunderscore our universal obligations to those who reside faraway and\nwith whom we may share little in the way of language, custom, or\nculture, oftentimes arguing that claims to \u201cjustice at\nhome\u201d can and should be applied elsewhere as well (Beardsworth\n2011; Beitz 1999; Caney 2006; Wallace-Brown & Held 2010). In this\nway, cosmopolitanism builds directly on the universalistic impulses of\nmodern moral and political thought. Cosmopolitanism\u2019s critics\ndispute the view that our obligations to foreigners possess the same\nstatus as those to members of particular local and national\ncommunities of which we remain very much a part. They by no means deny\nthe need to redress global inequality, for example, but they often\nexpress skepticism in the face of cosmopolitanism\u2019s tendency to\ndefend significant legal and political reforms as necessary to address\nthe inequities of a planet where millions of people a year die of\nstarvation or curable diseases (Miller 2007; 2013; Nagel 2005). Nor do\ncosmopolitanism\u2019s critics necessarily deny that the process of\nglobalization is real, though some of them suggest that its impact has\nbeen grossly exaggerated (Kymlicka 1999; Nussbaum et al.\n1996; Streeck 2016). Nonetheless, they doubt that humanity has\nachieved a rich or sufficiently articulated sense of a common fate\nsuch that far-reaching attempts to achieve greater global justice (for\nexample, substantial redistribution from the rich to poor) could prove\nsuccessful. Cosmopolitans not only counter with a flurry of\nuniversalist and egalitarian moral arguments, but they also accuse\ntheir opponents of obscuring the threat posed by globalization to the\nparticular forms of national community whose ethical primacy\ncommunitarians, nationalists, and others endorse. From the\ncosmopolitan perspective, the tendency to favor moral and political\nobligations to fellow members of the nation-state represents a\nmisguided and increasingly reactionary nostalgia for a rapidly\ndecaying constellation of political practices and institutions.\n\nA similar divide characterizes the ongoing debate about the prospects\nof democratic institutions at the global level. In a cosmopolitan\nmode, Daniele Archibugi (2008) and the late David Held (1995) have\nargued that globalization requires the extension of liberal democratic\ninstitutions (including the rule of law and elected representative\ninstitutions) to the transnational level. Nation state-based liberal\ndemocracy is poorly equipped to deal with deleterious side effects of\npresent-day globalization such as ozone depletion or burgeoning\nmaterial inequality. In addition, a growing array of genuinely\ntransnational forms of activity calls out for correspondingly\ntransnational modes of liberal democratic decision-making. According\nto this model, \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cnational\u201d matters\nshould remain under the auspices of existing liberal democratic\ninstitutions. But in those areas where deterritorialization and social\ninterconnectedness across national borders are especially striking,\nnew transnational institutions (for example, cross-border referenda),\nalong with a dramatic strengthening and further democratization of\nexisting forms of supranational authority (in particular, the United\nNations), are necessary if we are to assure that popular sovereignty\nremains an effective principle. In the same spirit, cosmopolitans\ndebate whether a loose system of global \u201cgovernance\u201d\nsuffices, or instead cosmopolitan ideals require something along the\nlines of a global \u201cgovernment\u201d or state (Cabrera 2011;\nScheuerman 2014). J\u00fcrgen Habermas, a prominent\ncosmopolitan-minded theorist, has tried to formulate a defense of the\nEuropean Union that conceives of it as a key stepping stone towards\nsupranational democracy. If the EU is to help succeed in salvaging the\nprinciple of popular sovereignty in a world where the decay of nation\nstate-based democracy makes democracy vulnerable, the EU will need to\nstrengthen its elected representative organs and better guarantee the\ncivil, political, and social and economic rights of all Europeans\n(Habermas 2001, 58\u2013113; 2009). Representing a novel form of\npostnational constitutionalism, it potentially offers some broader\nlessons for those hoping to save democratic constitutionalism under\nnovel global conditions. Despite dire threats to the EU posed by\nnationalist and populist movements, Habermas and other\ncosmopolitan-minded intellectuals believe that it can be effectively\nreformed and preserved (Habermas 2012).\n\nIn opposition to Archibugi, Held, Habermas, and other cosmopolitans,\nskeptics underscore the purportedly utopian character of such\nproposals, arguing that democratic politics presupposes deep feelings\nof trust, commitment, and belonging that remain uncommon at the\npostnational and global levels. Largely non-voluntary commonalities of\nbelief, history, and custom compose necessary preconditions of any\nviable democracy, and since these commonalities are missing beyond the\nsphere of the nation-state, global or cosmopolitan democracy is doomed\nto fail (Archibugi, Held, and Koehler 1998; Lieven 2020). Critics\ninspired by realist international theory argue that cosmopolitanism\nobscures the fundamentally pluralistic, dynamic, and conflictual\nnature of political life on our divided planet. Notwithstanding its\npacific self-understanding, cosmopolitan democracy inadvertently opens\nthe door to new and even more horrible forms of political violence.\nCosmpolitanism\u2019s universalistic normative discourse not only\nignores the harsh and unavoidably agonistic character of political\nlife, but it also tends to serve as a convenient ideological cloak for\nterrible wars waged by political blocs no less self-interested than\nthe traditional nation state (Zolo 1997, 24).\n\nOngoing political developments suggest that such debates are of more\nthan narrow scholarly interest. Until recently, some of\nglobalization\u2019s key prongs seemed destined to transform human\naffairs in seemingly permanent ways: economic globalization, as well\nas the growth of a panoply of international and global political and\nlegal institutions, continued to transpire at a rapid rate. Such\ninstitutional developments, it should be noted, were interpreted by\nsome cosmopolitan theorists as broadly corroborating their overall\nnormative aspirations. With the resurgence of nationalist and populist\npolitical movements, many of which diffusely (and sometimes\nmisleadingly) target elements of globalization, globalization\u2019s\nfuture prospects seem increasingly uncertain. For example, with\npowerful political leaders regularly making disdainful remarks about\nthe UN and EU, it seems unclear whether one of globalization\u2019s\nmost striking features, i.e., enhanced political and legal\ndecision-making \u201cbeyond the nation state,\u201d will continue\nunabated. Tragically perhaps, the failure to manage economic\nglobalization so as to minimize avoidable inequalities and injustices\nhas opened the door to a nationalist and populist backlash, with many\npeople now ready to embrace politicians and movements promising to\npush back against \u201cfree trade,\u201d relatively porous borders\n(for migrants and refugees), and other manifestations of globalization\n(Stiglitz 2018). Even if it seems unlikely that nationalists or\npopulists can succeed in fully halting, let alone reversing,\nstructural trends towards deterritorialization, intensified\ninterconnectedness, and social acceleration, they may manage to\nreshape them in ways that cosmopolitans are likely to find alarming.\nWhether or not nationalists and populists can successfully respond to\nmany fundamental global challenges (e.g., climate change or nuclear\nproliferation), however, remains far less likely.\n",
