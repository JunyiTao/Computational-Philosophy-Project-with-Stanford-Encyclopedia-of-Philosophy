    "main_text": "Philosophical questions for IP || What makes a good imprecise belief?\n3.6 What makes a good imprecise belief?\nThere are, as we have seen, certain structural properties that are\nnecessary conditions on rational belief. What exactly these are\ndepends on your views. However, there are further ways of assessing\nbelief. Strongly believing true things and strongly believing the\nnegations of false things seem like good-making-features of\nbeliefs. For the case of precise credences, we can make this\nprecise. There is a large literature on \u201cscoring rules\u201d:\nmethods for measuring how good a probability is relative to the actual\nstate of the world (Brier 1950; Savage 1971;\nJoyce 2009; Pettigrew 2011). These are numerical methods of\nmeasuring how good a probability is given the true state of the\nworld.\nFor the case of imprecise probabilities, however, the situation\nlooks bleak. No real valued scoring rule for imprecise probabilities\ncan have the desirable property of being strictly\nproper (Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane\n2012). Schoenfield (2017) presents a simple version of the result. Since strict propriety is a desirable property of a\nscoring rule (Br\u00f6cker and Smith 2007; Joyce\n2009; Pettigrew 2011), this failing is serious. So further work\nis needed to develop a well-grounded theory of how to assess imprecise\nprobabilities.\nMayo-Wilson and Wheeler (2016) provide a neater version of the proof, and offer a property weaker than strict propriety that an imprecise probability scoring rule can satisfy.\nCarr (2015) and Konek (forthcoming) both present positive suggestions for moving forward with imprecise scoring rules.\nLevinstein (forthcoming) suggests that the problem really only arises for determinately imprecise credences, but not for indeterminate credence.\n",
