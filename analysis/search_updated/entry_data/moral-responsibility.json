    "preamble": "\n\nMaking judgments about whether a person is morally responsible for her\nbehavior, and holding others and ourselves responsible for actions and\nthe consequences of actions, is a fundamental and familiar part of our\nmoral practices and our interpersonal relationships.\n\nThe judgment that a person is morally responsible for her behavior\ninvolves\u2014at least to a first approximation\u2014attributing\ncertain powers and capacities to that person, and viewing her behavior\nas arising (in the right way) from the fact that the person has, and\nhas exercised, these powers and capacities. Whatever the correct\naccount of the powers and capacities at issue (and canvassing\ndifferent accounts is the task of this entry), their possession\nqualifies an agent as morally responsible in a general sense: that is,\nas one who may be morally responsible for particular exercises of\nagency. Normal adult human beings may possess the powers and\ncapacities in question, and non-human animals, very young children,\nand those suffering from severe developmental disabilities or dementia\n(to give a few examples) are generally taken to lack them. \n\nTo hold someone responsible involves\u2014again, to a first\napproximation\u2014responding to that person in ways that are made\nappropriate by the judgment that she is morally responsible. These\nresponses often constitute instances of moral praise or moral blame\n(though there may be reason to allow for morally responsible behavior\nthat is neither praiseworthy nor blameworthy: see McKenna 2012:\n16\u201317 and M. Zimmerman 1988: 61\u201362). Blame is a response\nthat may follow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible\nfor behavior that is wrong or bad, and praise is a response that may\nfollow on the judgment that a person is morally responsible for\nbehavior that is right or good.\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that the above schema, while useful,\nmay be misleading in certain respects. For one thing, it suggests a\ncorrespondence and symmetry between praise and blame that may not\nexist. The two are certainly asymmetrical insofar as the attention\ngiven to blame far exceeds that given to praise. One reason for this\nis that blameworthiness, unlike praiseworthiness, is often taken to\ninvolve liability to a sanction. Thus, articulating the conditions of\nblameworthiness may seem to theorists the more pressing matter.\nPerhaps for related reasons, there is a richer language for expressing\nblame than praise (Watson 1996 [2004: 283]), and \u201cblame\u201d\nfinds its way into idioms for which there is no ready parallel\nemploying \u201cpraise\u201d: compare \u201cS is to\nblame for x\u201d and \u201cS is to\npraise for x\u201d. Note, as well, that \u201cholding\nresponsible\u201d is itself not a neutral expression: it typically\narises in blaming contexts (Watson 1996 [2004: 284]). Additionally,\nthere may be asymmetries in the contexts in which praise and blame are\nappropriate: private blame is a more familiar phenomenon than private\npraise (Coates & Tognazzini 2013a), and while minor wrongs may\nreasonably earn blame, minimally decent behavior often seems\ninsufficient for praise (see Eshleman 2014 for this and other\ndifferences between praise and blame). Finally, the widespread\nassumption that praiseworthiness and blameworthiness are at least\nsymmetrical in terms of the capacities they require has also been\nquestioned (Nelkin 2008, 2011; Wolf 1980, 1990). Like most work on\nmoral responsibility, this entry will tend to focus on the negative\nside of the phenomenon; for more, see the\n entry on blame.\n\nA few other general observations about the concept of moral\nresponsibility are in order before introducing particular conceptions\nof it. In everyday speech, one often hears references to\npeople\u2019s \u201cmoral responsibility\u201d where the point is\nto indicate that a person has some duty or obligation\u2014some\nresponsibility\u2014to which that person is required, by\nsome standard, to attend. In this sense, we say, for example, that a\nlawyer has a responsibility (to behave in certain ways, according to\ncertain standards) to his client. This entry, however, is concerned\nnot with accounts that specify people\u2019s responsibilities in the\nsense of duties and obligations, but rather with accounts of whether a\nperson bears the right relation to her own actions, and their\nconsequences, so as to be properly held accountable for them.\n(Unfortunately, this entry does not include discussion of some\nimportant topics related to moral responsibility, such as\nresponsibility for omissions (see Clarke 2014, Fischer &\nRavizza 1998, and Nelkin & Rickless 2017a) or collective\nresponsibility (see the\n entry on collective responsibility\n and Volumes 30 and 38 of Midwest Studies in Philosophy).\n\nMoral responsibility should also be distinguished from causal\nresponsibility. Causation is a complicated topic, but it is often\nfairly clear that a person is causally responsible for\u2014that is,\nshe is the (or a) salient cause of\u2014some occurrence or outcome.\nHowever, the powers and capacities that are required for moral\nresponsibility are not identical with an agent\u2019s causal powers,\nso we cannot infer moral responsibility from an assignment of causal\nresponsibility. Young children, for example, can cause outcomes while\nfailing to fulfill the requirements for general moral responsibility,\nin which case it will not be appropriate to judge them morally\nresponsible for, or to hold them morally responsible for, the outcomes\nfor which they may be causally responsible. And even generally morally\nresponsible agents may explain or defend their behavior in ways that\ncall into question their moral responsibility for outcomes for which\nthey are causally responsible. Suppose that S causes an\nexplosion by flipping a switch: the fact that S had no reason\nto expect such a consequence from flipping the switch might call into\nquestion his moral responsibility (or at least his blameworthiness)\nfor the explosion without altering his causal contribution to it.\nHaving distinguished different senses of responsibility, unless\notherwise indicated, \u201cresponsibility\u201d will refer to\n\u201cmoral responsibility\u201d (in the sense defined here)\nthroughout the rest of this entry.\n\nUntil fairly recently, the bulk of philosophical work on moral\nresponsibility was conducted in the context of debates about free\nwill, which largely concerned the various ways that (various sorts of)\ndeterminism might threaten free will and moral responsibility. A\nlargely unquestioned assumption was that free will is required for\nmoral responsibility, and the central questions had to do with the\ningredients of free will and with whether their possession was\ncompatible with determinism. Recently, however, the literature on\nmoral responsibility has addressed issues that are of interest\nindependently of worries about determinism. Much of this entry will\ndeal with these latter aspects of the moral responsibility debate.\nHowever, it will be useful to begin with issues at the intersection of\nconcerns about free will and moral responsibility.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Freedom, Responsibility, and Determinism\n\nHow is the responsible agent related to her actions; what power does\nshe exercise over them? One (partial) answer is that the relevant\npower is a form of control, and, in particular, a form of control such\nthat the agent could have done otherwise than to perform the\naction in question. This captures one commonsense notion of free will,\nand one of the central issues in debates about free will has been\nabout whether possession of it (free will, in the\nability-to-do-otherwise sense) is compatible with causal determinism\n(or with, for example, divine foreknowledge\u2014see the\n entry on foreknowledge and free will).\n\nIf causal determinism is true, then the occurrence of any event\n(including events involving human deliberation, choice, and action)\nthat does in fact occur was made inevitable by\u2014because it was\ncausally necessitated by\u2014the facts about the past (and the laws\nof nature) prior to the occurrence of the event. Under these\nconditions, the facts about the present, and about the future, are\nuniquely fixed by the facts about the past (and about the laws of\nnature): given these earlier facts, the present and the future can\nunfold in only one way. For more, see the\n entry on causal determinism.\n\nIf possession of free will requires an ability to act otherwise than\none in fact does, then it is fairly easy to see why free will has\noften been regarded as incompatible with causal determinism. One way\nof getting at this incompatibilist worry is to focus on the\nway in which performance of a given action should be up to an\nagent if he has the sort of free will required for moral\nresponsibility. As the influential Consequence Argument has it (Ginet\n1966; van Inwagen 1983: 55\u2013105; Wiggins 1973), the truth of\ndeterminism seems to entail that an agent\u2019s actions are\nnot up to him since they are the unavoidable consequences of\nthings over which the agent lacks control. Here is an informal summary\nof this argument from Peter van Inwagen\u2019s important book, An\nEssay on Free Will (1983):\n\n\nIf determinism is true, then our acts are the consequences of the laws\nof nature and events in the remote past. But it is not up to us what\nwent on before we were born, and neither is it up to us what the laws\nof nature are. Therefore, the consequences of these things (including\nour present acts) are not up to us. (1983: 16)\n\n\nFor an important argument that suggests that the Consequence Argument\nconflates different senses in which the laws of nature are not up to\nus, see David Lewis (1981). For more on incompatibilism and\nincompatibilist arguments, see the entries on \n free will, \n arguments for incompatibilism, \nand \n incompatibilist (nondeterministic) theories of free will, \nas well as Randolph Clarke (2003).\n\nCompatibilists maintain that free will (and/or moral\nresponsibility) is possible even in a deterministic universe. Versions\nof compatibilism have been defended since ancient times. For example,\nthe Stoics\u2014Chryssipus, in particular\u2014argued that the truth\nof determinism does not entail that human actions are entirely\nexplained by factors external to agents; thus, human actions are not\nnecessarily explained in a way that is incompatible with praise and\nblame (see Bobzien 1998 and Salles 2005 for Stoic views on freedom and\ndeterminism). Similarly, philosophers in the Modern period (such as\nHobbes and Hume) distinguished the general way in which our actions\nare necessitated if determinism is true from the specific instances of\nnecessity sometimes imposed on us by everyday constraints on our\nbehavior (e.g., physical impediments that make it impossible to act as\nwe choose). The difference is that the necessity involved in\ndeterminism is compatible with agents acting as they choose to act:\neven if S\u2019s behavior is causally determined, it may be\nbehavior that she chooses to perform. And perhaps the ability that\nmatters for free will (and responsibility) is just the ability to act\nas one chooses, which seems to require only the absence of external\nconstraints (and not the absence of determinism).\n\nThis compatibilist tradition was carried into the twentieth century by\nlogical positivists such A. J. Ayer (1954) and Moritz Schlick (1930\n[1966]). Here is how Schlick expressed the central compatibilist\ninsight in 1930 (drawing, in particular, on Hume): \n\n\nFreedom means the opposite of compulsion; a man is free if he\ndoes not act under compulsion, and he is compelled or unfree\nwhen he is hindered from without\u2026when he is locked up, or\nchained, or when someone forces him at the point of a gun to do what\notherwise he would not do. (1930 [1966: 59])\n\n\nSince deterministic causal pressures do not always force one to\n\u201cdo what otherwise he would not do\u201d, freedom\u2014at\nleast of the sort specified by Schlick\u2014is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nA closely related compatibilist strategy, influential in the early and\nmid-twentieth century, was to offer a conditional analysis of the\nability to do otherwise (Ayer 1954, Hobart 1934, Moore 1912; for\nearlier expressions, see Hobbes 1654 and Hume 1748). As just noted,\neven if determinism is true, agents may often act as they choose, and\nit is equally compatible with determinism that an agent who performed\nact A (on the basis of his choice to do so) might have\nperformed a different action on the condition that (contrary\nto what actually happened) she had chosen to perform the other action.\nEven if a person\u2019s actual behavior is causally determined by the\nactual past, it may be that if the past had been suitably different\n(e.g., if the person\u2019s desires, intentions, choices, etc. had\nbeen different), then she would have acted differently. And perhaps\nthis is all that the ability to do otherwise comes to: one can do\notherwise if it is true that if one had chosen to do otherwise, then\none would have done otherwise. \n\nHowever, this compatibilist picture is open to serious objections.\nFirst, it might be granted that an ability to act as one sees fit is\nvaluable, and perhaps related to the type of freedom at issue in the\nfree will debate, but it does not follow that this is all\nthat possession of free will comes to. A person who has certain\ndesires as a result of indoctrination, brainwashing, or\npsychopathology may act as he chooses, but his free will and moral\nresponsibility may still be called into question. (For more on the\nrelevance of such factors, see\n \u00a73.2\n and\n \u00a73.3.3.)\n More specifically, the conditional analysis is open to the following\nsort of counterexample. It might be true that an agent who performs\nact A would have omitted A if she had so chosen, but it\nmight also be true that the agent in question suffers from an\noverwhelming compulsion to perform act A. The conditional\nanalysis suggests that the agent in question retains the ability to do\notherwise than A, but, given her compulsion, it seems clear\nthat she lacks this ability (Broad 1934, Chisholm 1964, Lehrer 1968,\nvan Inwagen 1983). More generally, incompatibilists are likely to be\ndissatisfied with the conditional analysis since it fails to give an\naccount of an ability that agents can have, right here and right now,\nto either perform or omit an action while holding everything about the\nhere and now, and about the past, fixed.\n\nDespite the above objections, the compatibilist project described so\nfar has had significant lasting influence. As will be seen below, the\nfact that determined agents can act as they see fit is still an\nimportant inspiration for compatibilists, as is the fact that\ndetermined agents may have acted differently in counterfactual\ncircumstances. For more, see the\n entry on compatibilism.\n For recent accounts related to (and improving upon) early\ncompatibilist approaches, see Michael Fara (2008), Michael Smith\n(2003), and Kadri Vihvelin (2004), and for criticism of these\naccounts, see Randolph Clarke (2009).\n\nAnother influential trend in compatibilism has been to argue that\nmoral responsibility does not require an ability to do\notherwise. If this is right, then determinism would not threaten\nresponsibility by ruling out access to behavioral alternatives (though\ndeterminism might threaten responsibility in other ways: see van\nInwagen 1983: 182\u201388 and Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\n151\u2013168). In a very influential 1969 paper, Harry Frankfurt\noffers examples meant to show that an agent can be morally responsible\nfor an action even if he could not have done otherwise. Versions of\nthese examples are often called Frankfurt cases or\nFrankfurt examples. In the basic form of the example, an\nagent, Jones, considers a certain action. Another agent, Black, would\nlike to see Jones perform this action and, if necessary, Black can\nmake Jones perform it through some type of intervention in\nJones\u2019s deliberative process. However, as things transpire,\nBlack does not intervene in Jones\u2019s decision making since he can\nsee that Jones will perform the action on his own and for his own\nreasons. Black does not intervene to ensure Jones\u2019s action, but\nhe could have, and he would have, had Jones showed some sign that he\nwould not perform the action on his own. Therefore, Jones could\nnot have done otherwise, yet he seems responsible for his\nbehavior. After all, given Black\u2019s non-intervention,\nJones\u2019s action is a perfectly ordinary bit of voluntary\nbehavior.\n\nThere are questions about whether Frankfurt\u2019s example really\nshows that Jones is morally responsible even though he couldn\u2019t\nhave done otherwise. For one thing, it may not be clear that Jones\nreally couldn\u2019t have done otherwise: while he performed the\naction on his own, there was the alternative that he perform the\naction due to some intervention on Black\u2019s part, and not on his\nown. Furthermore, though he did not do so, Jones might have\ngiven Black some indication that he would not perform the action in\nquestion. Alternatively, an objection might be framed by asking how\nBlack could be certain that Jones would or would not perform the\naction on his own. There seems to be a dilemma here. Perhaps\ndeterminism obtains in the universe of the example, and Black sees\nsome sign that indicates the presence of factors that causally\nensure that Jones will behave in a particular way. But in this\ncase, incompatibilists are unlikely to grant that Jones is morally\nresponsible if they think that moral responsibility is incompatible\nwith determinism. On the other hand, perhaps determinism is not true\nin the universe of the example, but then it is not clear that the\nexample excludes alternatives for Jones: if Jones\u2019s behavior\nisn\u2019t causally determined, then perhaps he can do\notherwise. For objections to Frankfurt\u2019s original example along\nthese lines, see Carl Ginet (1996) and David Widerker (1995); for\ndefenses of Frankfurt, see John M. Fischer (1994: 131\u2013159; 2002;\n2010); and for refined versions of Frankfurt\u2019s example, meant to\nclearly deny Jones access to alternatives, see Alfred Mele and David\nRobb (1998), David Hunt (2000), and Derk Pereboom (2000; 2001:\n18\u201328).\n\nIn response to criticisms such as the above, Frankfurt has said that\nhis example was intended mainly to draw attention to the fact\n\u201cthat making an action unavoidable is not the same\nthing as bringing it about that the action is performed\u201d\n(2006: 340; emphasis in original). In particular, while determinism\nmay make an agent\u2019s action unavoidable, it does not follow that\nthe agent acts as he does only because determinism is true:\nit may also be true that he acts as he does because he wants to and\nbecause he sees reasons in favor of so acting. The point of his\noriginal example, Frankfurt suggests, was to draw attention to the\nsignificance that the actual causes of an agent\u2019s\nbehavior (such as her reasons and desires) can have independently of\nwhether the agent might have done something else. Frankfurt concludes\nthat \u201c[w]hen a person acts for reasons of his own\u2026the\nquestion of whether he could have done something else instead is quite\nirrelevant\u201d for the purposes of assessing responsibility (2006:\n340). A focus on the actual causes that lead to behavior, as well as\ninvestigation into when an agent can be said to act on her\nown reasons, has characterized a great deal of work on\nresponsibility since Frankfurt\u2019s essay (see \n \u00a72.3\nand \n \u00a73.3.3).\n2. Some Approaches to Moral Responsibility\n\nThis section discusses three important approaches to responsibility.\nAdditional perspectives (attributionism, conversational theories, mesh\nor structural accounts, skeptical accounts, etc.) are introduced in\nmore or less detail in the discussions of contemporary debates\nbelow.\n2.1 Forward-Looking Accounts\n\nForward-looking approaches to moral responsibility justify\nresponsibility practices by focusing on the beneficial consequences\nthat can be obtained by engaging in these practices. This approach was\ninfluential in the earlier parts of the twentieth century (as well as\nbefore), had fallen out of favor by the closing decades of that\ncentury, and has recently been the subject of renewed interest.\n\nForward-looking perspectives tend to emphasize one of the central\npoints discussed in the previous section: an agent\u2019s being\nsubject to determinism does not entail that he is subject to\nconstraints that force him to act independently of his choices. If\nthis is true, then, regardless of the truth of determinism, it may be\nuseful to offer certain incentives to agents\u2014to praise and blame\nthem and generally to treat them as responsible\u2014in order to\nencourage them to make certain choices and thus to secure positive\nbehavioral outcomes.\n\nAccording to some articulations of the forward-looking approach, to be\na responsible agent is simply to be an agent whose motives, choices,\nand behavior can be shaped in this way. Thus, Moritz Schlick argued\nthat\n\n\nThe question of who is responsible is the question concerning the\ncorrect point of application of the motive\u2026. in this\nits meaning is completely exhausted; behind it lurks no mysterious\nconnection between transgression and requital\u2026. It is a matter\nonly of knowing who is to be punished or rewarded, in order that\npunishment and reward function as such\u2014be able to achieve their\ngoal. (1930 [1966: 61]; emphasis in original)\n\n\nAnd, according to Schlick, the goals of punishment and reward have\nnothing to do with the past: the idea that punishment \u201cis a\nnatural retaliation for past wrong, ought no longer to be\ndefended in cultivated society\u201d (1930 [1966: 60]; emphasis in\noriginal). Instead, punishment ought to be \n\n\nconcerned only with the institution of causes, of motives of\nconduct\u2026. Analogously, in the case of reward we are concerned\nwith an incentive. (1930 [1966: 60]; emphasis in original) \n\n\nJ. J. C. Smart (1961) also defended a well-known, forward-looking\napproach to moral responsibility in the mid-twentieth century. Smart\nclaimed that to blame someone for a piece of behavior is simply to\nassess the behavior negatively (to \u201cdispraise\u201d it, in\nSmart\u2019s terminology) while simultaneously ascribing\nresponsibility for the behavior to the agent. And, for Smart, an\nascription of responsibility merely involves taking an agent to be\nsuch that he would have omitted the behavior if he had been provided\nwith a motive to do so. Whatever sanctions may follow on an ascription\nof responsibility are administered with eye to giving an agent motives\nto refrain from such behavior in the future.\n\nSmart\u2019s general approach has its contemporary defenders (Arneson\n2003), but many have found it lacking in important ways. For one\nthing, as R. Jay Wallace notes, an approach like Smart\u2019s\n\u201cleaves out the underlying attitudinal aspect of moral\nblame\u201d (Wallace 1996: 56, emphasis in original; see the next\nsubsection for more on blaming attitudes). According to Wallace, the\nattitudes involved in blame are \u201cbackward-looking and focused on\nthe individual agent who has done something morally wrong\u201d\n(Wallace 1996: 56). But a forward-looking approach, with its focus on\nbringing about desirable outcomes \n\n\nis not directed exclusively toward the individual agent who has done\nsomething morally wrong, but takes account of anyone else who\nis susceptible to being influenced by our responses. (Wallace 1996:\n56; emphasis added) \n\n\nIn exceptional cases, a focus on beneficial outcomes may provide\ngrounds for treating as blameworthy those who are known to be innocent\n(Smart 1973). This last feature of (some) forward-looking approaches\nhas led to particularly strong criticism.\n\nRecent efforts have been made to develop partially forward-looking\naccounts of responsibility that evade some of the criticisms mentioned\nabove. These (somewhat revisionary) accounts justify our\nresponsibility practices by appeal to their suitability for fostering\nmoral agency and the acquisition of capacities required for such\nagency. Most notable in this regard is Manuel Vargas\u2019s\n\u201cagency cultivation model\u201d of responsibility (2013; also\nsee Jefferson 2019 and McGeer 2015). Recent conversational accounts of\nresponsibility\n (\u00a73.2.2)\n also have an important forward-looking component insofar as they\nregard those with whom one might have fruitful moral interactions as\ncandidates for responsibility. Some responsibility skeptics have also\nemphasized the forward-looking benefits of certain responsibility\npractices. For example, Derk Pereboom\u2014who rejects desert-based\nblame\u2014has argued that some conventional blaming practices can be\nmaintained (even after ordinary notions of blameworthiness have been\nleft behind) insofar as these practices are grounded in\n\u201cnon-desert invoking moral desiderata\u201d such as\n\u201cprotection of potential victims, reconciliation to\nrelationships both personal and with the moral community more\ngenerally, and moral formation\u201d (2014: 134; also see Caruso\n2016, Levy 2012, and Milam 2016). In contrast to some of the\nforward-looking approaches described above, Pereboom (2017) proposes\nthat only those agents who have in fact acted immorally should be open\nto forward-aiming blaming practices. (For more on skepticism about\nresponsibility, see\n \u00a73.3\n and the\n entry on skepticism about moral responsibility.)\n2.2 The Reactive Attitudes Approach\n2.2.1 \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d\n\nP. F. Strawson\u2019s 1962 paper, \u201cFreedom and\nResentment\u201d, is a touchstone for much of the work on moral\nresponsibility that followed it, especially the work of\ncompatibilists. Strawson\u2019s aim was to chart a course between\nincompatibilist accounts committed to a free will requirement on\nresponsibility, and forward-looking compatibilist accounts that did\nnot, in Strawson\u2019s view, appropriately acknowledge and account\nfor the interpersonal significance of the affective component of our\nresponsibility practices. In contrast with forward-looking accounts\nsuch as J. J. C. Smart\u2019s and Moritz Schlick\u2019s\n (\u00a72.1),\n Strawson focuses directly on the emotions\u2014the reactive\nattitudes\u2014that play a fundamental role in our practices of\nholding one another responsible. Strawson\u2019s suggestion is that\nattending to the logic of these emotional responses yields an account\nof what it is to be open to praise and blame that need not invoke the\nincompatibilist\u2019s conception of free will. Indeed,\nStrawson\u2019s view has been interpreted as suggesting that no\nmetaphysical facts beyond our praising and blaming practices are\nneeded to ground these practices.\n\nPart of the novelty of Strawson\u2019s approach is its emphasis on\nthe \u201cimportance that we attach to the attitudes and intentions\ntowards us of other human beings\u201d (1962 [1993: 48]) and on \n\n\nhow much it matters to us, whether the actions of other\npeople\u2026reflect attitudes towards us of goodwill, affection, or\nesteem on the one hand or contempt, indifference, or malevolence on\nthe other. (1962 [1993: 49]) \n\n\nFor Strawson, our practices of holding others responsible are largely\nresponses to these things: that is, \u201cto the quality of\nothers\u2019 wills towards us\u201d (1962 [1993: 56]). \n\nTo get a sense of the importance of quality of will for our\ninterpersonal relations, note the difference in your response to one\nwho injures you accidentally as compared to how you respond to one who\ndoes you the same injury out of \u201ccontemptuous disregard\u201d\nor \u201ca malevolent wish to injure [you]\u201d (P. Strawson 1962\n[1993: 49]). The second case is likely to arouse a type and intensity\nof resentment that would not be (appropriately) felt in the first\ncase. Corresponding points may be made about positive responses such\nas gratitude: you would likely not have the same feelings of gratitude\ntoward a person who benefits you accidentally as you would toward one\nwho does so out of concern for your welfare. The focus here is on\npersonal reactive attitudes directed toward another on\none\u2019s own behalf, but Strawson also discusses \u201csympathetic\nor vicarious\u201d attitudes felt on behalf of others, and\n\u201cself-reactive attitudes\u201d that an agent may direct toward\nherself (1962 [1993: 56\u20137]). \n\nOn Strawson\u2019s view, the tendency to respond with relevant\nreactive attitudes to displays of good or ill will implicates a demand\nfor moral respect and due regard. Indeed, for Strawson, \u201c[t]he\nmaking of the demand is the proneness to such\nattitudes\u201d, and the attitudes themselves are the\n\u201ccorrelates of the moral demand in the case where the demand is\nfelt to be disregarded\u201d (1962 [1993: 63]; emphasis in original). Thus, among the\ncircumstances that mollify a person\u2019s (negative) reactive\nattitudes, are those which show that\u2014despite initial\nappearances\u2014the demand for due regard has not been ignored or\nflouted. When someone explains that the injury she caused you was\nentirely unforeseen and accidental, she indicates that her regard for\nyour welfare was not insufficient and that she is therefore not an\nappropriate target for the negative attitudes involved in moral\nblame.\n\nNote that the agent who excuses herself from blame in the above way is\nnot calling into question her status as a generally responsible agent:\nshe is still open to the demand for due regard and liable, in\nprinciple, to reactive responses. Other agents, however, may be inapt\ntargets for blame and the reactive emotions precisely because they are\nnot legitimate targets of a demand for regard. In these cases, an\nagent is not excused from blame, he is exempted from\nit: it is not that his behavior is discovered to have been\nnon-malicious, but rather that he is seen to be one of whom better\nbehavior cannot reasonably be demanded. (The widely-used terminology\nin which the above contrast is drawn\u2014\u201cexcuses\u201d\nversus \u201cexemptions\u201d\u2014is due to Watson 1987\n[2004]).\n\nFor Strawson, the most important group of exempt agents includes those\nwho are, at least for a time, significantly impaired for normal\ninterpersonal relationships. These agents may be children, or\npsychologically impaired like the \u201cschizophrenic\u201d; they\nmay exhibit \u201cpurely compulsive behaviour\u201d, or their minds\nmay have \u201cbeen systematically perverted\u201d (P. Strawson 1962\n[1993: 51]). Alternatively, exempt agents may simply be \u201cwholly\nlacking\u2026in moral sense\u201d (P. Strawson 1962 [1993: 58]),\nperhaps because they suffered from \u201cpeculiarly\nunfortunate\u2026formative circumstances\u201d (P. Strawson 1962\n[1993: 52]). These agents are not candidates for the range of\nemotional responses involved in our personal relationships because\nthey do not participate in these relationships in the right way for\nsuch responses to be sensibly applied to them. Rather than taking up\ninterpersonally-engaged attitudes (that presuppose a demand for\nrespect) toward exempt agents, we instead take an objective attitude\ntoward them. The exempt agent is not regarded \u201cas a morally\nresponsible agent\u2026as a member of the moral community\u201d (P.\nStrawson 1962 [1993: 59]); though he may be regarded as \u201can\nobject of social policy\u201d and as something \u201cto be managed\nor handled or cured or trained\u201d (P. Strawson 1962 [1993:\n52]).\n\nStrawson\u2019s perspective has an important compatibilist upshot. We\nmay be able, in limited circumstances, to take up a detached,\nobjective perspective on the behavior of normal (that is, non-exempt)\nagents. But Strawson argues that we cannot take up with this\nperspective permanently, and certainly not on the basis of discovering\nthat determinism is true:\n\n\nThe human commitment to participation in ordinary interpersonal\nrelationships is, I think, too thoroughgoing and deeply rooted for us\nto take seriously the thought that a general theoretical conviction\n[e.g., about the truth of determinism] might so change our world that,\nin it, there were no longer any such things as interpersonal\nrelationships as we normally understand them; and being involved in\ninter-personal relationships\u2026precisely is being exposed to the\nrange of reactive attitudes and feelings that is in question. (1962\n[1993: 54])\n\n\nMore specifically, the truth of determinism would not show that human\nbeings generally occupy excusing or exempting conditions that would\nmake the attitudes involved in holding one another responsible\ninappropriate. It would not follow from the truth of determinism, for\nexample, \u201cthat anyone who caused an injury either was\nquite simply ignorant of causing it or had acceptably\noverriding reasons for\u201d doing so (P. Strawson 1962 [1993: 53];\nemphasis in original); nor would it follow (from the truth of\ndeterminism) \n\n\nthat nobody knows what he\u2019s doing or that everybody\u2019s\nbehaviour is unintelligible in terms of conscious purposes or that\neverybody lives in a world of delusion or that nobody has a moral\nsense. (P. Strawson 1962 [1993: 59]) \n\n2.2.2 Criticisms of Strawson\u2019s Approach\n\nVarious objections have been raised regarding P. F. Strawson\u2019s\ngeneral theoretical approach to moral responsibility, his assumptions\nabout human psychology and sociality, and his arguments for the\ncompatibility of determinism and responsibility.\n\nAs noted in the previous subsection, Strawson argues that learning\nthat determinism is true would not raise general concerns about our\nresponsibility practices. This is because the truth of determinism\nwould not show that human beings are generally abnormal in a\nway that would call into question their openness to the reactive\nattitudes: \u201cit cannot be a consequence of any thesis which is\nnot itself self-contradictory that abnormality is the universal\ncondition\u201d (P. Strawson 1962 [1993: 54]). In reply, it has been\nnoted that while the truth of determinism might not suggest universal\nabnormality, it might well show that normal human beings are morally\nincapacitated in a way that is relevant to our responsibility\npractices (Russell 1992: 298\u2013301). Strawson\u2019s assumptions\nthat we are too deeply and naturally committed to our\nreactive-attitude-involving practices to give them up, and that doing\nso would irreparably distort our moral lives, have also been\ncriticized (Nelkin 2011: 42\u201345; G. Strawson 1986: 84\u2013120;\nWatson 1987 [2004: 255\u2013258]).\n\nA different sort of objection emphasizes the\nresponse-dependence of Strawson\u2019s account: that is, the\nway it explains an agent\u2019s responsibility in terms of the moral\nresponses that characterize a given community\u2019s responsibility\npractices, rather than in terms of independent facts about whether the\nagent is responsible. This feature of Strawson\u2019s\napproach invites a reading that may seem paradoxical:\n\n\nIn Strawson\u2019s view, there is no such independent notion of\nresponsibility that explains the propriety of the reactive attitudes.\nThe explanatory priority is the other way around: It is not that we\nhold people responsible because they are responsible; rather,\nthe idea (our idea) that we are responsible is to be\nunderstood by the practice, which itself is not a matter of holding\nsome propositions to be true, but of expressing our concerns and\ndemands about our treatment of one another. (Watson 1987 [2004: 222];\nemphasis in original; see Bennett 1980 for a related, non-cognitivist\ninterpretation of Strawson\u2019s approach)\n\n\nStrawson\u2019s approach would be particularly problematic if, as the\nabove reading might suggest, it entails that a group\u2019s\nresponsibility practices are\u2014as they stand and however\nthey stand\u2014beyond criticism simply because they are that\ngroup\u2019s practices (Fischer & Ravizza 1993a: 18).\n\nBut there is something to be said from the other side of the debate.\nIt may seem obvious that people are appropriately held responsible\nonly if there are independent facts about their responsibility. But on\nreflection\u2014and following R. Jay Wallace\u2019s (1996)\ninfluential Strawsonian approach\u2014it may be difficult \u201cto\nmake sense of the idea of a prior and thoroughly independent realm of\nmoral responsibility facts\u201d that is separate from our practices\nand yet to which our practices must answer (1996: 88). For Wallace,\ngiving up on practice-independent responsibility facts doesn\u2019t\nmean giving up on facts about responsibility; rather, \u201cwe must\ninterpret the relevant facts [about responsibility] as somehow\ndependent on our practices of holding people responsible\u201d (1996:\n89). Such an interpretation requires an investigation into our\npractices, and what emerges most conspicuously, for Wallace, from this\ninvestigation is the degree to which our responsibility practices are\norganized around a fundamental commitment to fairness (1996: 101).\nWallace develops this commitment to fairness, and to norms of\nfairness, into an account of the conditions under which people are\nappropriately held morally responsible for their behavior (1996:\n103\u2013109). (For a more recent defense of the response-dependent\napproach to responsibility, see Shoemaker 2017b; for criticism of such\napproaches, see Todd 2016.)\n2.3 Reasons-Responsiveness Views\n\nAs noted in\n \u00a71,\n one of the lasting influences of Harry Frankfurt\u2019s defense of\ncompatibilism was to draw attention to the actual causes of\nagents\u2019 behavior, and particularly to whether an\nagent\u2014even a causally determined agent\u2014acted for her own\nreasons. Reasons-responsiveness approaches to responsibility have been\nparticularly attentive to these issues. These approaches ground\nresponsibility by reference to agents\u2019 capacities for being\nappropriately sensitive to the rational considerations that bear on\ntheir actions. Interpreted broadly, reasons-responsiveness approaches\ninclude a diverse collection of views, such as David Brink and Dana\nNelkin (2013), John M. Fischer and Mark Ravizza (1998), Ishtiyaque\nHaji (1998), Michael McKenna (2013), Dana Nelkin (2011), Carolina\nSartorio (2016), R. Jay Wallace (1996), and Susan Wolf (1990). Fischer\nand Ravizza\u2019s Responsibility and Control (1998), which\nbuilds on Fischer (1994), offers the most influential articulation of\nthe reasons-responsiveness approach.\n\nFischer and Ravizza begin with a distinction between regulative\ncontrol and guidance control. Regulative control involves the\npossession of a dual power: \u201cthe power freely to do some act\nA, and the power freely to do something else instead\u201d\n(1998: 31). Guidance control, on the other hand, does not require\naccess to alternatives: it is manifested when an agent guides her\nbehavior in a particular direction (and regardless of whether it was\nopen to her to guide her behavior in a different direction). Since\nFischer and Ravizza take Frankfurt cases\n (\u00a71)\n to show that access to behavioral alternatives is not necessary for\nmoral responsibility, they conclude that \u201cthe sort of control\nnecessarily associated with moral responsibility for action is\nguidance control\u201d and not regulative control (1998: 33;\nemphasis in original).\n\nA number of factors can undermine guidance control. If a\nperson\u2019s behavior is brought about by hypnosis, brainwashing, or\ngenuinely irresistible urges, then that person may not be morally\nresponsible for her behavior since she does not reflectively guide it\nin the way required for responsibility (Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\n35). More specifically, an agent in the above circumstances is not\nlikely to be responsible because he \u201cis not responsive to\nreasons\u2014his behavior would be the same, no matter what reasons\nthere were\u201d (1998: 37). Thus, Fischer and Ravizza characterize\npossession of guidance control as (partially) dependent on\nresponsiveness to reasons. In particular, guidance control depends on\nwhether the psychological mechanism that issues in an\nagent\u2019s behavior is responsive to reasons. (Guidance control\nalso requires that an agent owns the mechanism on which she\nacts. According to Fischer and Ravizza, this requires placing\nhistorical conditions on responsibility; see\n \u00a73.3.3.)\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s focus on mechanisms is motivated by the\nfollowing reasoning. In a Frankfurt case, an agent is responsible for\nan action even though his so acting is ensured by external factors.\nBut the presence of these external factors means that the agent in a\nFrankfurt case would have acted the same no matter what reasons he was\nconfronted with, which suggests that the responsible agent in a\nFrankfurt scenario is not responsive to reasons. This is a problem for\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s claim that guidance control, and thus\nreasons-responsiveness, is necessary for responsibility. Fischer and\nRavizza\u2019s solution is to argue that while the agent in\na Frankfurt case may not be responsive to reasons, the agent\u2019s\nmechanism\u2014\u201cthe process that leads to the relevant upshot\n[i.e., the agent\u2019s action]\u201d\u2014may well be responsive\nto reasons (1998: 38). In other words, the agent\u2019s\ngenerally-specified psychological mechanism might have responded\n(under counterfactual conditions) to considerations in favor of\nomitting the action that the agent actually performed (and that he was\nguaranteed to perform, regardless of reasons, since he was in a\nFrankfurt-type scenario).\n\nFischer and Ravizza thus arrive at the following provisional\nconclusion: \u201crelatively clear cases of moral\nresponsibility\u201d\u2014that is, those in which an agent is not\nhypnotized, etc.\u2014are distinguished by the fact that \u201can\nagent exhibits guidance control of an action insofar as the mechanism\nthat actually issues in the action is his own, reasons-responsive\nmechanism\u201d (1998: 39). But how responsive to reasons\ndoes an agent\u2019s mechanism need to be for that agent to have the\ntype of control over his behavior associated with moral\nresponsibility? A strongly reasons-responsive mechanism would\nboth recognize and respond to any sufficient\nreason to act otherwise (1998: 41). (In Fischer and\nRavizza\u2019s terminology, such a mechanism is strongly\n\u201creceptive\u201d and \u201creactive\u201d to reasons). But\nstrong reasons-responsiveness cannot be required for guidance control\nsince many intuitively responsible agents\u2014i.e., many garden\nvariety wrongdoers\u2014fail to attend to sufficient reasons to do\notherwise. On the other hand, weak reasons-responsiveness is\nnot enough for guidance control. An agent with a weakly\nreasons-responsive mechanism will respond appropriately to\nsome sufficient reason to do otherwise, but the pattern of\nresponsiveness revealed in the agent\u2019s behavior might be too\narbitrary for the agent to be credited with the kind of control\nrequired for responsibility. A person\u2019s pattern of\nresponsiveness to reasons would likely seem erratic in the relevant\nway if, for example, she would forego purchasing a ticket to a\nbasketball game if it cost one thousand dollars, but not if it cost\ntwo thousand dollars (Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 66).\n\nFischer and Ravizza settle on moderate reasons responsiveness\nas the sort that is most germane to guidance control (1998:\n69\u201385). A psychological mechanism that is moderately responsive\nto reasons exhibits regularity with respect to its receptivity to\nreasons: that is, it exhibits \u201can understandable\npattern of (actual and hypothetical) reasons-receptivity\u201d\n(Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 71; emphasis in original). Such a pattern\nwill indicate that an agent understands \u201chow reasons fit\ntogether\u201d and that, for example, \u201cacceptance of one reason\nas sufficient implies that a stronger reason must also be\nsufficient\u201d (Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 71). (In addition, a\npattern of regular receptivity to reasons will include receptivity to\na range of moral considerations (Fischer & Ravizza 1998:\n77). This will rule out attributing moral responsibility to non-moral\nagents; see Todd and Tognazzini 2008 for criticism of Fischer and\nRavizza\u2019s articulation of this condition.) However, a moderately\nresponsive mechanism may be only weakly reactive to reasons\nsince, as Fischer and Ravizza put it (somewhat mysteriously),\n\u201creactivity is all of piece\u201d such \n\n\nthat if an agent\u2019s mechanism reacts to some incentive\nto\u2026[do otherwise], this shows that the mechanism can\nreact to any incentive to do otherwise. (1998: 73; emphasis\nin original)\n\n\nFischer and Ravizza\u2019s account has generated a great deal of\nattention and criticism. Some critics focus on the contrast (just\nnoted) between the conditions they impose on receptivity to reasons\nand those they impose on reactivity to reasons (McKenna 2005, Mele\n2006a, Watson 2001). Additionally, many are dissatisfied with Fischer\nand Ravizza\u2019s presentation of their account in terms of the\npowers of mechanisms as opposed to agents. This has led some authors\nto develop agent-based reasons-responsiveness accounts that address\nthe concerns that led Fischer and Ravizza to their mechanism-based\napproach (Brink & Nelkin 2013, McKenna 2013, Sartorio 2016).\n3. Contemporary Debates\n3.1 The \u201cFaces\u201d of Responsibility\n3.1.1 Attributability versus Accountability\n\nDo our responsibility practices accommodate distinct forms of moral\nresponsibility? Are there different senses in which people may be\nmorally responsible for their behavior? Contemporary interest in these\npossibilities has its roots in a debate between Susan Wolf and Gary\nWatson. Among other things, Wolf\u2019s important 1990 book,\nFreedom Within Reason, offers a critical discussion of\n\u201cReal Self\u201d theories of responsibility. According to these\nviews, a person is responsible for behavior that is attributable to\nher real self, and \n\n\nan agent\u2019s behavior is attributable to the agent\u2019s real\nself\u2026if she is at liberty (or able) both to govern her behavior\non the basis of her will and to govern her will on the basis of her\nvaluational system. (Wolf 1990: 33) \n\n\nThe basic idea is that a responsible agent is not simply moved by her\nstrongest desires, but also, in some way, approves of, or stands\nbehind, the desires that move her because they are governed by her\nvalues or because they are endorsed by higher-order desires.\nWolf\u2019s central example of a Real Self view is Watson\u2019s\n(1975). In an important and closely related earlier paper, Wolf (1987)\ncharacterizes Watson (1975), Harry Frankfurt (1971), and Charles\nTaylor (1976) as offering \u201cdeep self views\u201d. For more on\nreal-self/deep-self views, see\n \u00a73.3.3;\n for a recent presentation of a real-self view, see Chandra Sripada\n(2016).\n\nAccording to Wolf, one point in favor of Real Self views is that they\nexplain why people acting under the influence of hypnosis or\ncompulsive desires are often not responsible (1990: 33). Since these\nagents are typically unable, under these conditions, to govern their\nbehavior on the basis of their valuational systems, they are alienated\nfrom their actions in a way that undermines responsibility. But, for\nWolf, it is a mark against Real Self views that they tend to be silent\non the topic of how agents come to have the selves that they do. An\nagent\u2019s real self might, for example, be the product of a\ntraumatic upbringing, and Wolf argues that this would give us reason\nto question the \u201cagent\u2019s responsibility for her\nreal self\u201d and thus her responsibility for the present behavior\nthat issues from that self (1990: 37; emphasis in original). For an\nimportant account of an agent with such an upbringing, see\nWolf\u2019s (1987) fictional example of JoJo (and see Watson 1987\n[2004] for a related discussion of the convicted murderer Robert Alton\nHarris). For discussion of JoJo in this entry, see\n \u00a73.2.1,\n and for general discussion of the relevance of personal history for\npresent responsibility see\n \u00a73.3.3.\n\nWolf suggests that when a person\u2019s real self is the product of\nserious childhood trauma (or related factors), then that person is\npotentially responsible for her behavior only in a superficial sense\nthat merely attributes bad actions to the agent\u2019s real self\n(1990: 37\u201340). However, Wolf argues that ascriptions of moral\nresponsibility go deeper than such attributions can reach:\n\n\nWhen\u2026we consider an individual worthy of blame or of praise, we\nare not merely judging the moral quality of the event with which the\nindividual is so intimately associated; we are judging the moral\nquality of the individual herself in some more focused,\nnoninstrumental, and seemingly more serious way. (1990: 41)\n\n\nThis deeper form of assessment\u2014assessment in terms of\n\u201cdeep responsibility\u201d (Wolf 1990: 41)\u2014requires more\nthan that an agent is \u201cable to form her actions on the basis of\nher values\u201d, it also requires that \u201cshe is able to form\nher values on the basis of what is True and Good\u201d (Wolf 1990:\n75). This latter ability will be impaired or absent in an agent whose\nreal self is the product of pressures (such as a traumatic childhood)\nthat have distorted her moral vision. (For the relevance of moral\nvision, or \u201cmoral competence\u201d, for responsibility, see\n \u00a73.2.)\n\nIn \u201cTwo Faces of Responsibility\u201d (1996 [2004]), Gary Watson\nresponds to Wolf. Watson agrees with Wolf that some approaches to\nresponsibility\u2014i.e., self-disclosure views (a phrase\nWatson borrows from Benson 1987)\u2014focus narrowly on whether\nbehavior is attributable to an agent. But Watson denies that these\nattributions constitute a merely superficial form of responsibility\nassessment. After all, behavior that is attributable to an\nagent\u2014in the sense, for example, of issuing from her valuational\nsystem\u2014often discloses something interpersonally and morally\nsignificant about the agent\u2019s \u201cfundamental evaluative\norientation\u201d (Watson 1996 [2004: 271]). Thus, ascriptions of\nresponsibility in this responsibility-as-attributability\nsense are \u201ccentral to ethical life and ethical appraisal\u201d\n(Watson 1996 [2004: 263]).\n\nHowever, Watson agrees with Wolf that the above story of\nresponsibility is incomplete: there is more to responsibility than\nattributing actions to agents. In addition, we hold agents\nresponsible for their behavior, which \u201cis not just a matter\nof the relation of an individual to her behavior\u201d (Watson 1996\n[2004: 262]). When we hold responsible, we also \u201cdemand\n(require) certain conduct from one another and respond adversely to\none another\u2019s failures to comply with these demands\u201d\n(Watson 1996 [2004: 262]). The moral demands, and potential for\nadverse treatment, associated with holding others responsible are part\nof our accountability (as opposed to attributability)\npractices, and these features of accountability raise issues of\nfairness that do not arise in the context of determining whether\nbehavior is attributable to an agent (Watson 1996 [2004: 273]). Therefore,\nconditions may apply to accountability that do not apply to\nattributability: for example, perhaps \u201caccountability\nblame\u201d should be\u2014as Wolf suggested\u2014moderated in the\ncase of an agent whose \u201csqualid circumstances made it\noverwhelmingly difficult to develop a respect for the standards to\nwhich we would hold him accountable\u201d (Watson 1996 [2004:\n281]).\n\nThere are, then, two forms, or \u201cfaces\u201d, of responsibility\non Watson\u2019s account. There is responsibility-as-attributability,\nand when an agent satisfies the conditions on this form of\nresponsibility, behavior is properly attributed to her as reflecting\nmorally important features of her self\u2014her virtues and vices,\nfor example. But there is also responsibility-as-accountability, and\nwhen an agent satisfies the conditions on this form of responsibility,\nwhich requires more than the correct attribution of behavior, she is\nopen to being held accountable for that behavior in the ways that\npredominantly characterize moral blame.\n3.1.2 Attributionism\n\nIt has become common for the views of several authors to be described\n(with varying degrees of accuracy) as instances of\n\u201cattributionism\u201d; see Neil Levy (2005) for the first use\nof this term. These authors include Robert Adams (1985), Nomy Arpaly\n(2003), Pamela Hieronymi (2004), T. M. Scanlon (1998, 2008), George\nSher (2006a, 2006b, 2009), Angela\nSmith (2005, 2008), and Matthew Talbert (2012, 2013). Attributionists take\nmoral responsibility assessments to be mainly concerned with whether\nan action (or omission, character trait, or belief) is attributable to\nan agent for the purposes of moral assessment, where this usually\nmeans that the action (or omission, etc.) reflects the agent\u2019s\n\u201cjudgment sensitive attitudes\u201d (Scanlon 1998),\n\u201cevaluative judgments\u201d (A. Smith 2005), or, more\ngenerally, her \u201cmoral personality\u201d (Hieronymi 2008).\n\nAttributionism resembles the self-disclosure views mentioned by Watson\n(see the previous subsection) insofar as both focus on the way that a\nresponsible agent\u2019s behavior discloses interpersonally and\nmorally significant features of the agent\u2019s self. However, it\nwould be a mistake to conclude that contemporary attributionist views\nare interested only in specifying the conditions for what Watson calls\nresponsibility-as-attributability. In fact, attributionists typically\ntake themselves to be giving conditions for holding agents responsible\nin Watson\u2019s accountability sense. (See the previous\nsubsection for the distinction between accountability and\nattributability.)\n\nAccording to attributionism, fulfillment of attributability conditions\nis sufficient for holding agents accountable for their behavior. This\nmeans that attributionism rejects conditions on moral responsibility\nthat would excuse agents if their characters were shaped under adverse\nconditions (Scanlon 1998: 278\u201385), or if the thing for which the\nagent is blamed was not under her control (Sher 2006b and 2009, A.\nSmith 2005), or if the agent can\u2019t be expected to recognize the\nmoral status of her behavior (Scanlon 1998: 287\u2013290; Talbert\n2012). Attributionists reject these conditions on responsibility\nbecause morally and interpersonally significant behavior is\nattributable to agents that do not fulfill them, and such attributions\nare taken to be sufficient for an agent to be open to the responses\ninvolved in holding agents accountable for their behavior.\nAttributionists have also argued that blame may profitably be\nunderstood as a form of moral protest (Hieronymi 2001, A. Smith 2013,\nTalbert 2012); part of the appeal of this move is that moral protests\nmay be legitimate in cases in which the above conditions are not\nmet.\n\nSeveral objections have been posed to attributionism. Some argue that\nattributionists are wrong to reject the conditions on responsibility\nmentioned in the last paragraph (Levy 2005, 2011; Shoemaker 2011,\n2015a; Watson 2011). It has also been argued that the attributionist\naccount of blame is too close to mere negative appraisal (Levy 2005;\nWallace 1996: 80\u20131; Watson 2002). In addition, Scanlon (2008)\nhas been criticized for failing to take negative emotions such as\nresentment to be central to the phenomenon of blame (Wallace 2011,\nWolf 2011; a similar criticism would apply to Sher 2006a).\n3.1.3 Answerability\n\nBuilding on the distinction between attributability and accountability\n (\u00a73.1.1),\n David Shoemaker (2011 and 2015a) has introduced a third form of\nresponsibility: answerability. On Shoemaker\u2019s view,\nattributability-responsibility assessments respond to facts about an\nagent\u2019s character, accountability-responsibility responds to an\nagent\u2019s degree of regard for others, and\nanswerability-responsibility responds to an agent\u2019s evaluative\njudgments. However, A. Smith (2015) and Hieronymi (2008 and 2014) use\n\u201canswerability\u201d to refer to a view more like the\nattributionist perspective described in the previous subsection, and\nPereboom (2014) has used the term to indicate a form of responsibility\nmore congenial to responsibility skeptics.\n3.2 Moral Competence\n3.2.1 The Moral Competence Condition on Responsibility\n\nThe possibility that moral competence\u2014the ability to recognize\nand respond to moral considerations\u2014is a condition on moral\nresponsibility has been suggested at several points above\n (\u00a72.2.1,\n \u00a72.2.2,\n \u00a72.3,\n \u00a73.1.1,\n \u00a73.1.2).\n Susan Wolf\u2019s (1987) fictional story of \u201cJoJo\u201d is\none of the best-known illustrations of this proposal. JoJo was raised\nby an evil dictator, and as a result he became the same sort of\nsadistic tyrant that his father was. As an adult, JoJo is happy to be\nthe sort of person that he is, and he is moved by precisely the\ndesires (e.g., to imprison, torture, and execute his subjects) that he\nwants to be moved by. Thus, JoJo fulfills important conditions on\nresponsibility\n (\u00a73.1.1,\n \u00a73.3.3), however, Wolf argues that it may be unfair to hold him\nresponsible for his bad behavior.\n\nJoJo\u2019s upbringing plays an important role in Wolf\u2019s\nargument, but only because it left JoJo unable to fully appreciate the\nwrongfulness of his behavior. Thus, it is JoJo\u2019s impaired moral\ncompetence that does the real excusing work, and similar conclusions\nof non-responsibility should be drawn about all those whom we think\n\u201ccould not help but be mistaken about their [bad] values\u201d,\nif possession of these values impairs their ability to tell right from\nwrong (Wolf 1987: 57).\n\nMany others join Wolf in arguing that impaired moral competence\n(perhaps on account of one\u2019s upbringing or other environmental\nfactors) undermines one\u2019s moral responsibility (Benson 2001,\nDoris & Murphy 2007, Fischer & Ravizza 1998, Fricker 2010,\nLevy 2003, Russell 1995 and 2004, Wallace 1996, Watson 1987 [2004]).\nPart of what motivates this conclusion is the thought that it can be\nunreasonable to expect morally-impaired agents to avoid wrongful\nbehavior, and that it is therefore unfair to expose these agents to\nthe harm of moral blame on account of their wrongdoing. For detailed\ndevelopment of the moral competence requirement on responsibility in\nterms of considerations of fairness, see R. Jay Wallace (1996); also\nsee Erin Kelly (2013), Neil Levy (2009), and Gary Watson (1987\n[2004]). For rejection of the claim that blame is unfair in the case\nof the morally-impaired agent, see several of the defenders of\nattributionism mentioned in\n \u00a73.1.2\n (particularly Hieronymi 2004, Scanlon 1998, and Talbert 2012)\n\nThe moral competence condition on responsibility can also be motivated\nby the suggestion that impaired agents are not able to commit wrongs\nthat have the sort of moral significance to which blame would be an\nappropriate response. The basic idea here is that, while\nmorally-impaired agents can fail to show appropriate respect for\nothers, these failures do not necessarily constitute the kind of\nflouting of moral norms that grounds blame (Watson 1987 [2004: 234]).\nIn other words, a failure to respect others, is not always an\ninstance of blame-grounding disrespect for others, since the\nlatter (but not the former) requires the ability to comprehend the\nnorms that one violates (Levy 2007, Shoemaker 2011).\n3.2.2 Conversational Approaches to Responsibility\n\nConsiderations about moral competence play an important role in the\nrecent trend of conversational theories of responsibility,\nwhich construe elements of our responsibility practices as\nmorally-expressive moves in an ongoing moral conversation. The thought\nhere is that to fruitfully (and fully) participate in such a\nconversation, one must have some degree of competence in the (moral)\nlanguage of that conversation.\n\nSeveral prominent versions of the conversational approach develop P.\nF. Strawson\u2019s suggestion\n (\u00a72.2.1)\n that the negative reactive attitudes involved in blame are\nexpressions of a demand for moral regard from other agents.\nGary Watson argues that a demand \u201cpresumes\u201d, as a\ncondition on the intelligibility of expressing it,\n\u201cunderstanding on the part of the object of the demand\u201d\n(1987 [2004: 230]). Therefore, since, \u201c[t]he reactive attitudes\nare incipiently forms of communication\u201d, they are intelligibly\nexpressed \u201conly on the assumption that the other can comprehend\nthe message\u201d, and since the message is a moral one,\n\u201cblaming and praising those with diminished moral understanding\nloses its \u2018point,\u2019\u201d at least in a certain sense\n(Watson 1987 [2004: 230]; see Watson 2011 for a modification of this\nproposal). R. Jay Wallace argues, similarly, that since responsibility\npractices are internal to moral relationships that are \n\n\ndefined by the successful exchange of moral criticism and\njustification\u2026. it will be reasonable to hold accountable only\nsomeone who is at least a candidate for this kind of exchange of\ncriticism and justification. (1996: 164)\n\n\nMichael McKenna\u2019s Conversation and Responsibility\n(2012) offers the most developed conversational analysis of\nresponsibility. For McKenna, the \u201cmoral responsibility\nexchange\u201d occurs in stages: an initial \u201cmoral\ncontribution\u201d of morally salient behavior; the \u201cmoral\naddress\u201d of, e.g., blame that responds to the moral\ncontribution; the \u201cmoral account\u201d in which the first\ncontributor responds to moral address with, e.g., apology; and so on\n(2012: 89). Like Wallace and Watson, McKenna notes the way in which a\nmorally impaired agent will find it difficult \u201cto appreciate the\nchallenges put to her by those who hold [her] morally\nresponsible\u201d, but he also argues that a suitably impaired agent\ncannot even make the first move in a moral conversation (2012: 78).\nThus, the morally impaired agent\u2019s responsibility is called into\nquestion not only because she is unable to respond appropriately to\nmoral demands, but also because \u201cshe is incapable of acting from\na will with a moral quality that could be a candidate for assessment\nfrom the standpoint of holding responsible\u201d (McKenna 2012: 78).\nThis point is related to Neil Levy\u2019s and David Shoemaker\u2019s\ncontention, noted in the previous subsection, that impairments of\nmoral competence can leave an agent unable to harbor and express the\ntype of ill will or lack of regard to which blame responds. By\ncontrast, Watson (2011), seems to allow that significant moral\nimpairment is compatible with the ability to perform blame-relevant\nwrongdoing, even if such impairment undermines the wrongdoer\u2019s\nmoral accountability for her actions.\n\nFor another important account of responsibility in broadly\nconversational terms, see Shoemaker\u2019s discussion of the sort of\nmoral anger involved in holding others accountable for their behavior\n(2015a: 87\u2013117). For additional defenses and articulations of\nthe conversational approach to responsibility, see Stephen Darwall\n(2006), Miranda Fricker (2016), and Colleen Macnamara (2015).\n3.2.3 Psychopathy\n\nImpairments of moral competence come in degrees. Susan Wolf\u2019s\nJoJo\n (\u00a73.2.1)\n has localized impairments of the capacity to recognize and respond to\nmoral considerations, but it is not clear that he is entirely immune\nto moral considerations. However, at the far end of the spectrum, we\nencounter more globally and thoroughly impaired figures such as the\npsychopath. In philosophical treatments, the psychopath is typically\npresented as an agent who, while retaining other psychological\ncapacities, is entirely\u2014or as nearly so as\npossible\u2014incapable of responding appropriately to moral\nconsiderations. (This is something of a philosophical construct since\nreal-life psychopathy admits of varying degrees of impairment,\ncorresponding to higher or lower scores on diagnostic measures.)\n\nOne interesting question is whether the psychopath\u2019s\ninability\u2014or at least consistent failure\u2014to respond\nappropriately to moral incentives is primarily the result of a\nmotivational rather than cognitive failure: does the psychopath in\nsome way know what morality requires and simply not care? If a\npositive answer is given to this last question (Fischer & Ravizza\n1998: 76\u201381; Nichols 2002), then it seems likely that the\npsychopath could be responsible for at least some of his bad behavior.\nAnd some have argued that even if psychopathy is primarily a cognitive\nimpairment, it may still be the case that psychopaths possess a\nsufficient capacity for distinguishing right and wrong\u2014or that\nthey possess sufficient related capacities\u2014to be held\nresponsible, at least to some extent and in certain ways (Glannon\n1997, Greenspan 2003, Maibom 2008, Shoemaker 2014, Vargas &\nNichols 2007). On the other hand, many believe that the\npsychopath\u2019s capacity for grasping moral considerations is too\nsuperficial to sustain responsibility (Kennett 2019; Levy 2007; Nelkin\n2015; Wallace 1996: 177\u201378; Watson 2011; see Mason 2017 for the\nclaim that the relevant deficiency is one of moral knowledge rather\nthan moral capacity). And still others have argued that even those who\nare fully impaired for moral understanding are open to blame as long\nas they possess broader rational competencies (Scanlon 1998:\n287\u2013290; Talbert 2014). However, the psychopath\u2019s\npossession of these broader competencies has been called into question\n(Fine & Kennett 2004, Greenspan 2003, Litton 2010).\n3.3 Skepticism and Related Topics \n\nThis section introduces contemporary skepticism about moral\nresponsibility by way of discussions of several topics that have broad\nrelevance for thinking about responsibility.\n\nIf moral responsibility requires free will, and free will involves\naccess to alternatives in a way that is not compatible with\ndeterminism, then it would follow from the truth of determinism that\nno one is ever morally responsible. The above reasoning, and the\nskeptical conclusion it reaches, is endorsed by the hard\ndeterminist perspective on free will and responsibility, which\nwas defended historically by Spinoza and d\u2019Holbach (among\nothers) and, more recently, by Ted Honderich (2002). But given that\ndeterminism may well be false, contemporary skeptics about moral\nresponsibility more often pursue a hard incompatibilist line\nof argument according to which the kind of free will required for\ndesert-based (as opposed to forward-looking, see\n \u00a72.1)\n moral responsibility is incompatible with the truth or\nfalsity of determinism (Pereboom 2001, 2014). The skeptical\npositions discussed below are generally of this sort: the skeptical\nconclusions they advocate do not depend on the truth of\ndeterminism.\n3.3.1 Moral Luck\n\nAccording to Thomas Nagel, a person is subject to moral luck if\nfactors that are not under that person\u2019s control affect the\nmoral assessments to which he is open (Nagel 1976 [1979]; also see\nWilliams 1976 [1981] and the\n entry on moral luck.)\n \n\nIs there such a thing as moral luck? More specifically, can luck\naffect a person\u2019s moral responsibility? Consider a would-be\nassassin who shoots at her target, aiming to kill, but fails to do so\nonly because her bullet is deflected by a passing bird. It seems that\nsuch a would-be assassin has good moral outcome luck (that\nis, good moral luck in the outcome of her behavior). Because of\nfactors beyond her control, the would-be assassin\u2019s moral record\nis better than it would have been: in particular, she is not a killer\nand is not morally responsible for causing anyone\u2019s death. One\nmight think, in addition, that the would-be assassin is less\nblameworthy than a successful assassin with whom she is otherwise\nidentical, and that the reason for this is just that the successful\nassassin intentionally killed someone while the unsuccessful assassin\n(as a result of good moral luck) did not. (For important recent\ndefenses of moral luck, see Hanna 2014 and Hartman 2017.) \n\nOn the other hand, one might think that if the two assassins just\nmentioned are identical in terms of their values, goals, intentions,\nand motivations, then the addition of a bit of luck to the\nunsuccessful assassin\u2019s story cannot ground a deep contrast\nbetween these two agents in terms of their moral responsibility. One\nway to sustain this position is to argue that moral responsibility is\na function solely of internal features of agents, such as their\nmotives and intentions (Khoury 2018; also see Enoch & Marmor 2007\nfor some of the main arguments against moral luck). Of course, the\nsuccessful assassin is responsible for something (killing a\nperson) for which the unsuccessful assassin is not, but it might be\npossible to argue that both are morally responsible\u2014and\npresumably blameworthy\u2014to the same degree insofar as it\nwas true of both of them that they aimed to kill, and that they did so\nfor the same reasons and with the same degree of commitment toward\nbringing about that outcome (see M. Zimmerman 2002 and 2015 for this\ninfluential perspective). \n\nBut now consider a different would-be assassin who does not even try\nto kill anyone, but only because his circumstances did not favor this\noption. This would-be assassin is willing to kill under\nfavorable circumstances (and so he may seem to have had good\ncircumstantial moral luck since he was not in those\ncircumstances). Perhaps the degree of responsibility attributed to the\nsuccessful and unsuccessful assassins described above depends not so\nmuch on the fact that they both tried to kill as on the fact that they\nwere both willing to kill; in this case, the would-be assassin just\nintroduced may share their degree of responsibility since he shares\ntheir willingness to kill. But an account that focuses on how agents\nwould be willing to act under counterfactual circumstances is likely\nto generate unintuitive conclusions about responsibility since many\nagents who are typically judged blameless might willingly perform\nterrible actions under the right circumstances. (M. Zimmerman 2002 and\n2015 does not shy away from this consequence, but criticisms of his\nefforts to reject moral luck\u2014Hanna 2014, Hartman 2017\u2014have\nmade much of it; see Peels 2015 for a position that is related to\nZimmerman\u2019s but that may avoid the unintuitive consequence just\nmentioned.) \n\nAnother approach to luck holds that it is inimical to moral\nresponsibility in a way that generally undermines responsibility\nascriptions. To see the motivation for this skeptical position,\nconsider constitutive moral luck: that is, luck in how one is\nconstituted in terms of the \u201cinclinations, capacities, and\ntemperament\u201d one finds within oneself (Nagel 1976 [1979: 28]).\nFacts about a person\u2019s inclinations, capacities, and temperament\nexplain much\u2014if not all\u2014of that person\u2019s behavior,\nand if the facts that explain why a person acts as she does are a\nresult of good or bad luck, then perhaps it is unfair to hold her\nresponsible for that behavior. As Nagel notes, once the full sweep of\nthe various kinds of luck comes into view, \u201c[t]he area of\ngenuine agency\u201d may seem to shrink to nothing since our actions\nand their consequences \u201cresult from the combined influence of\nfactors, antecedent and posterior to action, that are not within the\nagent\u2019s control\u201d (1976 [1979: 35]). If this is right, then\nperhaps, \n\n\nnothing remains which can be ascribed to the responsible self, and we\nare left with nothing but a\u2026sequence of events, which can be\ndeplored or celebrated, but not blamed or praised. (Nagel 1976 [1979:\n37]) \n\n\nThe above quotations notwithstanding, Nagel himself doesn\u2019t\nfully embrace a skeptical conclusion about responsibility on grounds\nof moral luck, but others have done so, most notably, Neil Levy\n(2011). According to Levy\u2019s \u201chard luck view\u201d, the\nencompassing nature of moral luck means \u201cthat there are no\ndesert-entailing differences between moral agents\u201d (2011: 10).\nOf course, there are differences between agents in terms of their\ncharacters and the good or bad actions and outcomes that they produce,\nbut Levy\u2019s point is that, given the influence of luck in\ngenerating these differences, they don\u2019t provide a sound basis\nfor differential treatment of people in terms of moral praise and\nblame. (See Russell 2017 for a compatibilist account that is led to a\nvariety of pessimism, though not skepticism, on the basis of the\nconcerns about moral luck just described.)\n3.3.2 Ultimate Responsibility\n\nAnother important skeptical argument\u2014related to the observations\nabout constitutive moral luck in the previous subsection\u2014is\nGalen Strawson\u2019s Basic Argument, which concludes that \u201cwe\ncannot be truly or ultimately morally responsible for our\nactions\u201d (1994: 5). (Since the argument targets\n\u201cultimate\u201d moral responsibility, it does not necessarily\nexclude other forms, such as forward-looking responsibility\n (\u00a72.1)\n and, on some understandings, responsibility-as-attributability\n (\u00a73.1.1).)\n The argument begins by noting that an agent makes the choices she\ndoes because of certain facts about the way she is: for example, the\nfacts about what seems choiceworthy to her. But if this is true, then,\nin order to be responsible for her subsequent choices, perhaps an\nagent also needs to be responsible for the facts about what seems\nchoiceworthy to her. But how can one be responsible for these prior\nfacts about herself? Wouldn\u2019t this require a prior choice on the\npart of the agent, one that resulted in her present dispositions to\nsee certain ends and means as choiceworthy? But this prior choice\nwould itself be something for which the agent is responsible only if\nthe agent is also responsible for the fact that that prior\nchoice seemed choiceworthy to her. And now we must explain how the\nagent can be responsible for this additional prior fact about herself,\nwhich will require positing another choice by the agent, and the\nresponsibility for that choice will also have to be secured, which\nwill require explaining why it seemed choiceworthy to her, and so on.\nA regress looms here, and Strawson claims that it cannot be stopped\nexcept by positing an initial act of self-creation on the responsible\nagent\u2019s part (1994: 5, 15). Only self-creating agents could be\nfully responsible for their own tendencies to exercise their powers of\nchoice as they do, but self-creation is impossible, so no one is every\ntruly or ultimately morally responsible for their behavior.\n\nA number of replies to this argument (and the argument from\nconstitutive moral luck) are possible. One might simply deny that\nhow a person came to be the way she is matters for present\nresponsibility: perhaps all we need to know in order to judge a\nperson\u2019s present responsibility are facts about her present\nconstitution and about how that constitution is related to the\nperson\u2019s present behavior. (For views like this, see the\ndiscussion of attributionism\n (\u00a73.1.2)\n and the discussion of non-historical accounts of responsibility in\nthe next subsection). Alternatively, one might think that while\npersonal history matters for moral responsibility, Strawson\u2019s\nargument sets the bar too high, requiring too much historical\ncontrol over one\u2019s constitution (see Fischer 2006; for a reply,\nsee Levy 2011: 5). Perhaps what is needed is not literal\nself-creation, but simply an ability to enact changes in oneself so as\nto acquire responsibility for the self that results from these changes\n(Clarke 2005). A picture along these lines can be found in\nAristotle\u2019s suggestion that one can be responsible for being a\ncareless person if one\u2019s present state of carelessness is the\nresult of earlier choices that one made (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics; see also Michele Moody-Adams 1990).\n\nRoughly in this Aristotelian vein, Robert Kane offers a detailed\nincompatibilist account of how we can secure ultimate responsibility\nfor our actions (1996 and 2007). On Kane\u2019s view, for an agent\n\n\n\nto be ultimately responsible for [a] choice, the agent must\nbe at least in part responsible by virtue of choices or actions\nvoluntarily performed in the past for having the character and motives\nhe or she now has. (2007: 14; emphasis in original) \n\n\nThis position may appear to be open to the regress concerns presented\nin Galen Strawson\u2019s argument above. But Kane thinks a regress is\navoided in cases in which a person\u2019s character-forming choices\nare undetermined. Since these undetermined choices will have no\nsufficient causes, there is no relevant prior cause for which\nthe agent must be responsible, so there is no regress problem (Kane\n2007: 15\u201316; see Pereboom 2001: 47\u201350 for criticism of\nKane on this point.)\n\nOf particular interest to Kane are potential character-forming choices\nthat occur \u201cwhen we are torn between competing visions of what\nwe should do or become\u201d (2007: 26). In such cases, if a person\nsees reasons in favor of either choice that he might make, and the\nchoice that he makes is undetermined, then whichever choice he makes\nwill have been chosen for his own reasons. According to Kane, when an\nagent makes this kind of choice, he shapes his character, and since\nhis choice is not determined by prior causal factors, he is\nresponsible for it and for the character it shapes and for the\ncharacter-determined choices that he makes in the future.\n\nKane\u2019s approach is an important instance of those\nincompatibilist theories that attempt to explain how free will, while\nrequiring indeterminism, could clearly be at home in the natural world\nas we know it (also see Balaguer 2010, Ekstrom 2000, and Franklin\n2018). (This is as opposed to agent-causal accounts of free\nwill\u2014Chisholm 1964, O\u2019Connor 2000\u2014that invoke a type\nof causal power that is less easily naturalized). However, many have\nargued that any account like Kane\u2019s, which inserts an\nindeterministic link in the causal chain leading to action, actually\nreduces an agent\u2019s control over an action or at least leaves it\nunclear why such an insertion would increase agential control over\nactions as compared to a deterministic story of action (Hobart 1934;\nLevy 2011: 41\u201383; Pereboom 2014: 31\u201349; van Inwagen 1983:\n126\u201352; Watson 1999).\n3.3.3 Personal History and Manipulation\n\nAccounts such as Neil Levy\u2019s (2011) and Galen Strawson\u2019s\n(1994), described in the two preceding subsections, assume that the\nfacts about the way a person came to be the way she is are relevant\nfor determining her present responsibility. But non-historical views,\nsuch as attributionism\n (\u00a73.1.2)\n and the views that Susan Wolf calls \u201cReal Self\u201d theories\n (\u00a73.1.1),\n reject this contention. Real Self accounts are sometimes referred to\nas \u201cstructural\u201d or \u201chierarchical\u201d theories,\nand John M. Fischer and Mark Ravizza (1998: 184\u2013187) have called\nthem \u201cmesh\u201d theories. By whatever name, the basic idea is\nthat an agent is morally responsible insofar as her will has the right\nsort of structure: in particular, there needs to be a mesh or fit\nbetween the desires that actually move the agent and her values, or\nbetween the desires that move her and her higher-order desires, the\nlatter of which are the agent\u2019s reflective preferences about\nwhich desires should move her. (For approaches along these lines, see\nDworkin 1970; Frankfurt\n1971, 1987; Neely 1974; and Watson 1975.)\n\nHarry Frankfurt\u2019s comparison between a willing drug addict and\nan unwilling addict illustrates important features of his version of\nthe structural approach to responsibility. Both of Frankfurt\u2019s\naddicts have desires to take the drug to which they are addicted, and\nthe nature of their addictions is such that both addicts will\nultimately act to fulfill their first-order addictive desire. But\nsuppose that both addicts are capable of taking higher-order\nperspectives on their first-order desires, and suppose that they take\ndifferent higher-order perspectives. The willing addict\nendorses and identifies with his addictive desire. The unwilling\naddict, on the other hand, repudiates his addictive desire to such an\nextent that, when it ends up being effective, Frankfurt says that this\naddict is \u201chelplessly violated by his own desires\u201d (1971:\n12). The willing addict has a kind of freedom that the unwilling\naddict lacks: they may both be bound to take the drug to which they\nare addicted, but insofar as the willing addict is moved by a desire\nthat he endorses, he acts freely in a way that the unwilling addict\ndoes not (Frankfurt 1971: 19). A related conclusion about\nresponsibility may be drawn: perhaps the unwilling addict\u2019s\ndesire is alien to him in such a way that his responsibility for\nacting on it is called into question (for a recent defense of this\nconclusion, see Sripada 2017). \n\nOne objection to Frankfurt\u2019s view goes like this. His account\nseems to assume that the addicts\u2019 higher-order desires have the\nauthority to speak for them\u2014they reveal (or constitute) the\nagent\u2019s \u201creal self\u201d, to use Wolf\u2019s language\n(1990). But if higher-order desires are invoked out of a concern that\nan agent\u2019s first-order desires may not stem from his real self,\nwhy won\u2019t the same worry recur with respect to higher-order\ndesires as well? In other words, when ascending through the orders of\ndesires, why stop at any particular point, why not think that appeal\nto a still higher order is always necessary to reveal where an agent\nstands? (See Watson (1975) for an objection along these lines, which\npartly motivates Watson\u2014in his articulation of a structural\napproach\u2014to focus on whether an agent\u2019s desires conform\nwith her values, rather than with her higher-order\ndesires).\n\nAnd even if one agrees with Frankfurt (or Watson) about the structural\nelements required for responsibility, one might wonder how an\nagent\u2019s will came to have its particular structure. Thus, an\nimportant type of objection to Frankfurt\u2019s view notes that the\nrelevant structure might have been put in place by factors that\nintuitively undermine responsibility, in which case the presence of\nthe relevant structure is not itself sufficient for responsibility\n(Fischer & Ravizza 1998: 196\u2013201; Locke 1975; Slote 1980).\nFischer and Ravizza argue that \n\n\n[i]f the mesh [between higher- and lower-order desires] were produced\nby\u2026brainwashing or subliminal advertising\u2026we would not\nhold the agent morally responsible for his behavior \n\n\nbecause the psychological mechanism that produced the behavior would\nnot be, \u201cin an important intuitive sense, the agent\u2019s\nown\u201d (1998: 197; emphasis in original). In response to this\ntype of worry, Fischer and Ravizza argue that responsibility has an\nimportant historical component, which they attempt to capture with\ntheir account of how agents can \u201ctake responsibility\u201d for\nthe psychological mechanisms that produces their behavior (1998:\n207\u2013239). (For criticism of Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s account\nof taking responsibility, see Levy 2011: 103\u2013106 and Pereboom\n2001: 120\u201322; for quite different accounts of taking\nresponsibility, see Enoch 2012; Mason 2019: 179\u2013207; and Wolf\n2001. For work on the general significance of personal histories for\nresponsibility, see Christman 1991, Vargas 2006, and D. Zimmerman\n2003.)\n\nPart of Fischer and Ravizza\u2019s motivation for developing their\naccount of \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d was to ensure that\nagents who have been manipulated in certain ways do not turn out to be\nresponsible on their view. Several examples and arguments featuring\nthe sort of manipulation that worried Fischer and Ravizza have played\nimportant roles in the recent literature on responsibility. One of\nthese is Alfred Mele\u2019s Beth/Ann example (1995, 2006b), which\nemphasizes the difficulties faced by accounts of responsibility that\neschew historical conditions. In the example, Ann has acquired her\npreferences and values in the normal way, but Beth is manipulated by a\nteam of neuroscientists so that she now has preferences and values\nthat are identical to Ann\u2019s. After the manipulation, Beth is\ncapable of reflecting on her new values, and when she does so, she\nendorses them enthusiastically. But whereas we might normally take\nsuch an endorsement to be a sign of the sort of self-governance\nassociated with responsibility, Mele suggests that Beth, unlike Ann,\nexhibits merely \u201cersatz self-government\u201d since\nBeth\u2019s new values where imposed on her (1995: 155). And if\ncertain kinds of personal histories similarly undermine an\nagent\u2019s ability to genuinely or authentically govern her\nbehavior, then agents with these histories will not be morally\nresponsible. (For replies to Mele and general insights into\nmanipulation cases, see Arpaly 2003, King 2013, McKenna 2004, and Todd\n2011; for discussion of issues about personal identity that arise in\nmanipulation cases, see Khoury 2013, Matheson 2014, Shoemaker\n2012)\n\nNow one can take a hard line in Beth\u2019s case (McKenna 2004). Such\na stance might involve noting that while Beth acquired her new values\nin a strange way (and in a way that involved moral wrongs done to\nher), everyone acquires their values in ways that are not\nfully under their control. Indeed, following Galen Strawson\u2019s\nline of argument (1994), described in\n \u00a73.3.2,\n it might be noted that no one has ultimate control over\ntheir values, and even if normal agents have some capacity to address\nand alter their values, the dispositional factors that govern how this\ncapacity is used are ultimately the result of factors beyond\nagents\u2019 control. So perhaps it is not as clear as it might first\nappear that Beth is distinguished from normal agents in terms of her\npowers of self-governance and her moral responsibility for her\nbehavior. But this reasoning can cut both ways: instead of showing\nthat Beth is assimilated into the class of normal, responsible agents,\nit might show that normal agents are assimilated into the class of\nnon-responsible agents like Beth. Derk Pereboom\u2019s four-case\nargument employs a maneuver along these lines (1995, 2001, 2007,\n2014).\n\nPereboom\u2019s argument presents Professor Plum in four different\nscenarios. In each scenario, Plum kills Ms. White while satisfying the\nconditions on desert-involving moral responsibility most often\nproposed by compatibilists (and described in earlier sections of this\nentry): Plum kills White because he wants to, and while this desire is\nin keeping with Plum\u2019s character, it is not irresistible; Plum\nalso endorses his desire to kill White from a higher-order volitional\nperspective; finally, Plum is generally morally competent, and the\nprocess of deliberation that leads to his decision to kill White is\nappropriately responsive to reasons.\n\nIn Case 1, Plum is \u201ccreated by neuroscientists,\nwho\u2026manipulate him directly through the use of radio-like\ntechnology\u201d (Pereboom 2001: 112). These scientists cause\nPlum\u2019s reasoning to take a certain (reasons-responsive) path\nthat culminates in Plum concluding that the self-serving reasons in\nfavor of killing White outweigh the reasons in favor of not doing so.\nPereboom believes that in such a case Plum is clearly not responsible\nfor killing White since his behavior was determined by the actions of\nthe neuroscientists. In Cases 2 and 3, Plum is causally determined to\nundertake the same reasoning process as in Case 1, but in Case 2 Plum\nis merely programmed to do so by neuroscientists (rather than having\nbeen created by them), and in Case 3 Plum\u2019s reasoning is the\nresult of socio-cultural influences that determine his character. In\nCase 4, Plum is just a normal human being in a causally deterministic\nuniverse, and he decides to kill White in the same way as in the\nprevious cases.\n\nPereboom claims that there is no relevant difference between Cases 1,\n2, and 3 such that our judgments about Plum\u2019s responsibility\nshould be different in these three cases. Furthermore, the reason that\nPlum is not responsible in these cases seems to be that, in each case,\nhis behavior is causally determined by forces beyond his control\n(Pereboom 2001: 116). But then we should conclude that Plum is not\nresponsible in Case 4 (since causal determinism is the defining\nfeature of that case). And since, in Case 4, Plum is just a normal\nhuman being in a causally deterministic universe, the conclusion we\ndraw about him should extend to all other normal persons in causally\ndeterministic universes. (For an important, related manipulation\nargument, see Mele\u2019s \u201czygote argument\u201d in Mele 1995,\n2006b, and 2008.)\n\nPereboom\u2019s argument has inspired a number of objections. For\nexample, it could be argued that in Case 1, the manipulation to which\nPlum is subject undermines his responsibility for some reason besides\nthe fact that the manipulation causally determines his behavior, which\nwould stop the generalization from Case 1 to the subsequent cases\n(Fischer 2004, Mele 2005, Demetriou 2010; for a response to this line\nof argument, see Matheson 2016; Pereboom addresses this concern in his\n2014 presentation of the argument; also see Shabo 2010).\nAlternatively, it might be argued, on compatibilist grounds, that Plum\nis responsible in Case 4, and this conclusion might be extended to the\nearlier cases since Plum fulfills the same compatibilist-friendly\nconditions on responsibility in those cases (McKenna 2008).\n\nThe four-case argument attempts to show that if determinism is true,\nthen we cannot be the sources of our actions in the way required for\nmoral responsibility. It is, therefore, an argument for\nincompatibilism rather than for skepticism about moral responsibility.\nBut, in combination with Pereboom\u2019s argument that we lack the\nsort of free will required for responsibility even if determinism is\nfalse (2001: 38\u201388; 2014: 30\u201370), the four-case argument\nhas emerged as an important part of a detailed and influential\nskeptical perspective. For other skeptical accounts, see Caruso\n(2016), Smilansky (2000),\nWaller (2011); also see the\n entry on skepticism about moral responsibility.\n3.3.4 The Epistemic Condition on Responsibility\n\nThere has been a recent surge in interest in the epistemic, or\nknowledge, condition on responsibility (as opposed to the freedom or\ncontrol condition that is at the center of the free will debate). In\nthis context, the following epistemic argument for skepticism about\nresponsibility has been developed. (In certain structural respects,\nthe argument resembles Galen Strawson\u2019s skeptical argument\ndiscussed in\n \u00a73.3.2.)\n\nSometimes agents act in ignorance of the likely bad consequences of\ntheir actions, and sometimes their ignorance excuses them from blame\nfor so acting. But in other cases, an agent\u2019s ignorance might\nnot excuse him. How can we distinguish the cases where ignorance\nexcuses from those in which it does not? One proposal is that\nignorance fails to excuse when the ignorance is itself something for\nwhich an agent might be blamed. And one proposal for when ignorance is\nblameworthy is that it issues from a blameworthy benighting\nact in which an agent culpably impairs, or fails to improve, his own\nepistemic position (H. Smith 1983). In such a case, the agent\u2019s\nignorance seems to be his own fault, so it cannot be appealed to in\norder to excuse the agent.\n\nBut when is a benighting act blameworthy? Several philosophers have\nsuggested that we are culpable for benighting acts only when we engage\nin them knowing that we are doing so and knowing that we should not do\nso (Levy 2011, Rosen 2004, M. Zimmerman 1997). Ultimately, the\nsuggestion is that ignorance for which one is blameworthy, and that\nleads to blameworthy unwitting wrongdoing, has its source in\nknowing wrongful behavior. Thus, if someone unwittingly does\nsomething wrong, then that person will be blameworthy only if we can\nexplain his lack of knowledge (his \u201cunwittingness\u201d) by\nreference to something else that he knowingly did wrong.\n\nConsider an example from Gideon Rosen (2004) in which a surgeon orders\nher patient to be transfused with the wrong type of blood, and suppose\nthat the surgeon was unaware that she was making this mistake.\nAccording to Rosen, the surgeon will be blameworthy for harming her\npatient only if she is blameworthy for being ignorant about the\npatient\u2019s blood type when she requests the transfusion, and she\nwill be blameworthy for this only if her ignorance stems from some\ninstance in which the surgeon knowingly failed to do something that\nshe ought to have done to avoid her later ignorance. It won\u2019t,\nfor example, be enough that the surgeon\u2019s ignorance is explained\nby her failure to doublecheck the patient\u2019s medical records. In\norder to ground blame, this omission on the surgeon\u2019s part must\nitself have been culpable, which requires that the surgeon knew that\nthis omission was wrong. And if the surgeon wasn\u2019t aware that\nshe was committing a wrongful omission (when she failed to doublecheck\nher patient\u2019s medical records), then this failure of\nknowledge on the surgeon\u2019s part must be explained by some prior\nculpable\u2014that is, knowing\u2014act or omission. In the end, for\nRosen, \n\n\nthe only possible locus of original responsibility [for a\nlater unwitting act] is an akratic act\u2026. a knowing\nsin. (2004: 307; emphasis in original) \n\n\nSimilarly, Michael Zimmerman argues that \n\n\nall culpability can be traced to culpability that involves lack of\nignorance, that is, that involves a belief on the agent\u2019s part\nthat he or she is doing something morally wrong. (1997: 418)\n\n\nThe above reasoning may apply not just to cases in which a person is\nunaware of the consequences of her action, but also to cases in which\na person is unaware of the moral status of her behavior. A slaveowner,\nfor example, might think that slaveholding is permissible, and so, on\nthe account considered here, he will be blameworthy only if he is\nculpable for his ignorance about the moral status of slavery, which\nwill require, for example, that he ignored evidence about its moral\nstatus while knowing that this is something he should not do (Rosen\n2003 and 2004).\n\nThese reflections can give rise to a couple forms of skepticism about\nmoral responsibility (and particularly about blameworthiness). First,\nwe might come to endorse a form of epistemic skepticism on the grounds\nthat we rarely have insight into whether a wrongdoer was\nakratic\u2014that is, was a knowing wrongdoer\u2014at some suitable\npoint in the etiology of a given action (Rosen 2004). Alternatively,\nor in addition, one might endorse a more substantive form of\nskepticism on the grounds that a great many normal wrongdoers\ndon\u2019t exhibit the sort of knowing wrongdoing supposedly required\nfor responsibility. In other words, perhaps very many wrongdoers\ndon\u2019t know that they are wrongdoers and their ignorance\non this score is not their fault since it doesn\u2019t arise from an\nappropriate earlier instance of knowing wrongdoing. In this case, very\nmany ordinary wrongdoers may fail to be morally responsible for their\nbehavior. (For skeptical suggestions along these lines, see M.\nZimmerman 1997 and Levy 2011.) \n\nThere is more to the epistemic dimension of responsibility than what\nis contained in the above skeptical argument, but the argument does\nbring out a lot of what is of interest in this domain. For one thing,\nit prominently relies on a tracing strategy. This strategy is\nused, for example, in accounts that feature a person who does not, at\nthe time of action, fulfill control or knowledge conditions on\nresponsibility, but who nonetheless seems morally responsible for her\nbehavior. In such a case, the agent\u2019s responsibility may be\ngrounded in the fact that her failure to fulfill certain conditions on\nresponsibility is traceable to earlier actions undertaken by the agent\nwhen she did fulfill these conditions. For example, a person may be so\nintoxicated that she lacks control over, or awareness of, her\nbehavior, and yet it may still be appropriate to hold her responsible\nfor her intoxicated behavior insofar as she freely took steps to\nintoxicate herself. The tracing strategy plays an important role in\nmany accounts of responsibility (see, e.g., Fischer & Ravizza\n1998: 49\u201351), but it has also been subjected to important\ncriticisms (see Vargas 2005; for a reply see Fischer and Tognazzini\n2009; for more on tracing, see Khoury 2012, King 2014, Shabo 2015, and\nTimpe 2011).\n\nVarious strategies for rejecting the above skeptical argument also\nillustrate stances one can take on the relevance of knowledge for\nresponsibility. These strategies typically involve rejecting the claim\nthat knowing wrongdoing is fundamental to blameworthiness. For\nexample, it might be argued that it is often morally reckless to\nperform actions when one is merely uncertain whether they are wrong,\nand that this recklessness is sufficient for blameworthiness (see\nGuerrero 2007; also see Nelkin & Rickless 2017b and Robichaud\n2014). Another strategy would be to argue that blameworthiness can be\ngrounded in cases of morally ignorant wrongdoing if it is reasonable\nto expect the wrongdoer to have avoided her moral ignorance, and\nparticularly if her ignorance is itself caused by the agent\u2019s\nown epistemic and moral vices (FitzPatrick 2008 and 2017). Relatedly,\nit might be argued that one who is unaware that he does wrong is\nblameworthy if he possessed relevant capacities for avoiding his\nfailure of awareness; this approach may be particularly promising in\ncases in which an agent\u2019s lack of moral awareness stems from a\nfailure to remember her moral duties (Clarke 2014, 2017 and\nSher 2006b, 2009; also see\nRudy-Hiller 2017). Finally, it might simply be claimed that morally\nignorant wrongdoers can harbor, and express through their behavior,\nobjectionable attitudes or qualities of will that suffice for\nblameworthiness (Arpaly 2003, Bj\u00f6rnsson 2017, Harman 2011, Mason\n2015, Talbert 2013). This approach may be most promising in cases in\nwhich a wrongdoer is aware of the material outcomes of her conduct but\nunaware of the fact that she does wrong in bringing about those\noutcomes.\n\nFor more, see the\n entry on the epistemic condition for moral responsibility.\n",
