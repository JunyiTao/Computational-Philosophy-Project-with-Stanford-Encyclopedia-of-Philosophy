    "preamble": "\n\nIn almost all our activities, we engage with other people, usually in\npersistent connections or associations that vary according to our\npurposes. We have foundational associative experiences within our\nfamilies; formative years of schooling with peers and teachers;\nworkplace links with bosses, employees, and colleagues with whom we\nshare at least corridors, carpet, and resources; and connections with\nlike-minded companions, such as fellow hobbyists, devotees, friends,\nor union members.\n\nSome of our associations are voluntary, such as a typical friendship.\nOthers are non-voluntary, such as the childhood family or\ninstitutional environment in which we are born and raised. Some of our\nassociations offer lasting connections with specific people, such as,\nusually, our parents, children, spouses, and colleagues. Others are\nlooser affiliations with people we may not know directly, based on\ncommon identity, history, or ambition, such as a national club, a\nstudent union, the \u201cRepublican base\u201d, the \u201cAmerican\npeople\u201d, the Jewish community, and Christians. Some of these\nlatter affiliations stretch the notion of an association into\na metaphor, but they highlight that associations are defined by people\nhaving a common purpose. That common purpose is sometimes the\nassociation itself: many of our intimate associations exist for their\nown sake, that is, for the sake of associating with one another. Other\ntimes, the common purpose is a further, independent goal, such as\nfinancial success, worship, recreation, achievement, joint\nself-expression, or political control.\n\nThis entry surveys several philosophical debates about the nature,\nscope, and value of our freedom to associate with other people in\nthese different ways as well as our freedom to dissociate both from\nparticular people and from people in general. Key questions concern,\nfirst, our degree of freedom to decide who is in and who is out: When\nmay we refuse to associate with other people? When may we leave the\nassociations we are in? When may we deny someone membership in our\nassociation? When may third-parties, such as the state, sever, compel,\nor intrude upon our associations? Second, key questions concern our\ndegree of freedom to decide what to do as associates: What level of\ncontrol should we have over the internal workings of our associations,\nespecially if those workings harm either members or non-members? To\nwhat extent may we radically reshape, and thereby redefine, the\nassociations we are in?\n\nThe answers to these two sets of questions will provide a unifying\nanalysis of the vast and seemingly disparate array of associations to\nwhich we can belong. The analysis will explore the phenomenology of\ndifferent kinds of associations, from the intimate world of family\nlife to the detached relations among strangers that define\ncitizenship. The analysis will assess the meaning, function, and value\nof freedom of association within this comprehensive image of\nassociative life.\n\nThere are several different frameworks through which to assess the\nvalue of association and freedom of association. Kantians would\nemphasize the importance of securing equal external freedom for\nindividual citizens, something which the state can help to secure by\nhindering those who would hinder others\u2019 freedom. Rawlsians\nwould highlight that freedom of association, like other basic rights\nand liberties, has a certain priority in political reasoning and\ncannot easily be defeated by countervailing considerations (Quong\n2011: 15; cf. Moles 2014: 85\u2013103). In a Rawlsian framework, the\nscope and limits of freedom of association are justified with\nreference to what we need in order to develop and exercise what Rawls\ncalls the two moral powers (which are, first, the capacity\nfor a sense of justice and, second, the capacity for a conception of\nthe good) (Rawls 1993: 19\u201320). This entry will take a broader\nview of freedom of association, focusing on the diverse range of\nassociations we can have, and highlighting, specifically, the array of\nsocial goods that our associations can make available to us.\n\nThis entry begins with a taxonomy of different ways of associating and\nthe related phenomena of interacting and assembling\n (\u00a71).\n It then elucidates the general apparatus of rights, duties, and\nfreedoms that underpin different associative contexts\n (\u00a72)\n before homing in on three rights in particular\u2014the right to\nexclude\n (\u00a73),\n the right to exit\n (\u00a74),\n and the right to organizational autonomy\n (\u00a75;\n White 2013)\u2014distinguishing between the rights of individuals\nvis-\u00e0-vis groups, and the rights of groups\nqua groups. The entry connects individuals\u2019 associative\nrights to other rights that contain associative aspects, such as\nfreedom of expression and freedom of religion. The entry discusses\ngroups\u2019 associative rights in relation to kindred, collective,\nand national freedoms, such as national self-governance and\nimmigration control, exploring how these latter freedoms connect to\nthe wider framework of associative freedom. Examining states\u2019\nrights to exclude and self-govern is necessary here since some\nphilosophers invoke a parallel between individuals\u2019 associative\nfreedoms and states\u2019 rights in order to defend comprehensive\nstate rights to exclude. The entry also assesses the importance of\nassociative freedom relative both to competing rights (such as\npositive rights to inclusion, care, and companionship) and other\nvalues (such as equality and state interests).\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Kinds of Associations\n\nIn taxonomizing the different associations to which we typically\nbelong, we should note the contrast drawn in the literature between\nintimate associations and collective associations.\nThis contrast is somewhat forced since, in reality, these association\ntypes are fluid. First, our various collegial, fraternal, romantic,\npolitical, creedal, professional, recreational, and philanthropic\nassociations can have both intimate and collective aspects (Alexander\n2008: 13). Falling in love at work or at school can change the meaning\nof those associations for the people involved. Second, all\nconsequential associations\u2014be they intimate or\ncollective\u2014are sites in which our beliefs are formed and their\nexpression germinated (Shiffrin 2005: 841). Third, interesting\ncontrasts\u2014such as the contrast between voluntary and\nnon-voluntary associations or between hierarchical and\nnon-hierarchical associations\u2014cut across any distinction we\nmight draw between intimate and collective associations. Both\nnon-voluntary associations and hierarchical associations are to be\nfound in intimate settings, educational settings, and national\nsettings, to name just a few, and these have constitutive power over\nthe ways we view our lives (Walzer 2004: 1\u201320). Finally, a key\nargument for protecting associations\u2014that they help to safeguard\nour individual freedom\u2014applies to all manner of\nassociations.\n\nConsequently, our associations are possibly better understood as\nfalling along a continuum that ranges from the more intimate and\nnon-instrumental at one end to the more impersonal and instrumental at\nthe other (Brownlee 2015: 269). Despite this fluidity, the distinction\nbetween intimate associations and collective\nassociations remains useful since it identifies the central\nfunction of a given association. For instance, while it is possible to\nmeet our spouse at work and to form friendships at work, doing these\nthings is not the primary function of work environments and workplace\nassociations. The fact that workplace settings can serve this\nsecondary, or unintended, function of fostering intimate ties should\nnot dictate or, in some cases, even influence the forms that workplace\nassociations take. Hence, this entry retains the traditional contrast\nbetween intimate associations and collective associations in order to\nhighlight the conceptual and normative issues that are particularly\nsalient to specific paradigmatic forms of associations.\n1.1 Intimate Associations\n\nParadigmatically, our intimate associations with friends, family, and\nloved ones are persistent, meaningful connections marked by frequent\ndirect interactions animated by affection, interest, care, concern and\nlove. As such, they form a core part of our lives. A central feature\nof such associations is that they exist for the acts and goods of the\nassociations themselves, rather than as instruments for public\nexpression or further advantage. As Justice Douglas says of family in\nGriswold v Connecticut, \u201cIt is an association that\npromotes a way of life, not causes\u201d (381 U.S. 479 (1965)). \n\nFamilies are often held up as the paragon of intimacy,\nlove, and affection. Throughout human history, our spousal, parental,\nand sibling relations have been our primary forms of association.\nHowever, love and affection need not be the principal reasons for\nforming families. Security, financial advantage, and avoiding worse\nalternatives can all be reasons for us to marry and form families.\nNonetheless, when children are raised in families conspicuously\nlacking in love and affection, children are denied the kinds of\nassociations that are vital to their present well-being and their\nemotional, social and cognitive development (Liao 2006; 2015: ch.\n3).\n\nFriendships are also important parts of our childhood and\nadult experience. Without them, we struggle to discover, shape, and\npursue our ideas of what constitutes a good life. But, again,\nfriendships can take many forms for many reasons, not all of which are\ngrounded in mutual affection and convivial warmth (Aristotle,\nNicomachean Ethics, Book VIII). Friendships can be rooted in\nmutual advantage, status, and convenience.\n\nAs this implies, the \u201cways of life\u201d afforded to us by our\nintimate associations can lack emotional intimacy. When they do lack\nit, the qualifier \u201cintimate\u201d is a placeholder for our\n\u201cpersonal\u201d, \u201cindividual\u201d, or\n\u201cdyadic\u201d associations, rather than a description of the\nquality and value of our associative bonds. Given that emotional\ncloseness\u2014true intimacy\u2014is an important part of our\nwell-being, its presence or absence can identify the limits of the\nrights, powers, and duties we have within our intimate\nassociations.\n1.2 Collective Associations\n\n\u201cCollective\u201d is a catchword for a smorgasbord of\nassociations, from chess clubs, to trade unions, churches and\nbusinesses, which are usually not dyadic, and which have a primary\nfunction other than associating as such. We can distinguish different\ncollective associations according to their primary functions, again\nrecognizing that a given association can perform multiple functions,\nincluding those functions closer in spirit to intimate\nassociations.\n\nEducational associations are an important early form of\nassociation outside the family and perhaps, more than any other,\nillustrate the fluidity of associational types. Children associate\nnon-voluntarily with teachers (hierarchical) and with peers\n(non-hierarchical), and thereby learn many of the social skills needed\nto make good on their rights of association within the wider world.\nSchool is most often assessed with a view to its important\ninstrumental purposes, particularly for future, work-related\nimperatives, but is equally a site of often intense and long-lasting\nintimate relationships.\n\nExpressive associations aim to give a larger microphone\nto a set of people than they would have individually, and can thus\noften serve to check the powers of other associations, interest\ngroups, governments, and state bureaucracies (Craiutu 2008:\n266\u20137). Expressive associations include not only advocacy groups\nand civil rights groups, but also segregationist groups and xenophobic\ngroups. Examples of expressive associations include the ACLU, the\nNAACP, Amnesty International, the LGBTQIA community, the NRA, and the\nKKK. In addition to lending people a larger microphone, such\nassociations can also serve a simpler, cathartic or identify-affirming\nfunction, enabling members to solidify through joint expression their\nsense of what they value (Farber 2001: 1494ff).\n Recreational associations for the joint enjoyment of\nhobbies are not paradigmatically expressive, but instead are\npleasure-oriented or progress-oriented. The members of a chess club do\nexpress a fondness for chess, but the primary function is to play and\nlearn about chess, not to express that fondness.\nCommercial and professional associations often consume\nmore time in our day than our intimate connections do. Work\nassociations can include collegiate relationships, trade unions,\nguilds, networking groups, and business groups. Such connections are\nalmost invariably shaped by important associative asymmetries between\nemployees\u2019 and employers\u2019 rights to decide about\nmembership and associative activities (White 1998: 337).\nThe free association of producers, as it occurs in\nMarxism and some anarchist literature, points to a variation in the\nidea that employees have associative freedom, highlighting a deeper\ncritique of the very concept of freedom of association. Given\nthat work is, for most of us, an associational form of activity that\nwe are compelled to undertake\u2014on pain of potentially severe\nsuffering\u2014and over which we often have little control, Marxists\nwonder how free we can really be in our associative decisions (Gorz\n1997 [1999]; James 2017: 285).\nIntentional communities sit somewhere between clans and\nneighborhoods and nations. Such communities lack the organic\nspontaneity that usually typifies residential communities. Instead,\nthese communities arise when people with similar interests,\nideologies, and concerns come together to share those things in\nsubstantial ways. Often this sharing has an ecological aspect, as with\ncommunes, or a concern with security and property values, as with\ngated communities (Low 2003: 151\u2013172). But, it can also be\nenacted by far-right political groups looking to preserve racial\ncultures which they perceive as under threat by the majority\nculture.\nNational and state associations, like our childhood\nfamily environments, are non-voluntary. We are born within a nation or\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction, and are compelled to associate at some\nlevel with the other people who fall under that jurisdiction. If we\nhave adequate resources, we may leave. But, we will only end up within\nthe circle of another such association (Dworkin 1986: 192\u2013193).\nSimilarly, if we are forced out, we will find ourselves within another\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction. Our state or national associations\ninevitably impact on our other associations, the social norms that\ndefine our families, the associative interests we develop, and the\npatterns of socialization we undergo at school, in churches, in clubs,\nand at work (Walzer 2004: 14\u201315). Moreover, the ways that\nnations and states are organized, being defined with and restricted by\nborders, limits who we, as employers, workers and potential partners,\nget to interact with and who gets to interact with us (Carens 1987:\n253; Kukathas 2005: 210).\n1.3 Related Phenomena: Interactions and Assemblies\n\nOur persistent associations differ from, but intersect with, our\npractice of engaging in ordinary interactions with each other and our\npractice of assembling together.\nInteracting: Interactions of some sort are a\npre-requisite for associations. Two \u201cfriends\u201d are hardly\nfriends if they opt never to interact with each other when they could.\nWithin large collectives, of course, many members won\u2019t know or\ninteract with each other at all. But, each member must interact with\nsome other member for them to count as a member and for their\ncollective to count as an association. Interactions are also a domain\nof interpersonal engagement unto themselves apart from associations.\nOur average day is full of incidental interactions with strangers and\nnon-associates, on buses, in the streets, in parks with children, and\nin buying milk from the local shop. These micro-moments of connection\nconstitute a significant portion of our experience of living together\nwith other people (Fredrickson 2013: Part I; Speck 2012: 49; Cacioppo\n& Patrick 2008: 237). While philosophers tend to focus on\nlarger-scale, substantive and active forms of association, they have\nreason to analyze as well the ambient sociability (or lack of it) that\nis available to us within our general environment, and the ways that\nour incidental interactions (or lack of them) can resonate with the\nrest of our associational life. For example, the phenomena of\n\u201cneighborhood effects\u201d on voting behavior, our attitudes\nto strangers, and our own self-esteem, are important in thinking about\nthe associative value in our routine connections that fall short of\nthicker forms of association (Sampson 2011). These interactions and\nthe incidental communities they create provide resources that can\nbuild up to, and support, the more substantive goods that flow from\nmeaningful association (Fleischacker 1998: 273; Fredrickson 2013: Part\nII). Importantly, the quality and number of these incidental\nmicro-interactions is subject partly to our control. We limit our\nopportunities for such moments if, for example, we choose to shop\nonline, to commute alone in our car, or to retreat into a gated\ncommunity with vigorous vetting processes for residents.\nAssembling: Association and assembly are often discussed\nin the same breath. International agreements such as the Universal\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) (Article 20.1) lump the two\ntogether to declare that \u201ceveryone has the right to freedom of\npeaceful assembly and association\u201d. Commentaries on the drafting\nof the UDHR acknowledge that drafters conjoined these two activities\nin a single Article because drafters were thinking principally about\nhow to protect political associations such as trade unions (Scheinin\n1999: 418\u2013419). Subsequent international agreements such as the\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enumerate our\nrights to association and rights to assembly within different\nArticles. One reason for this could be to acknowledge that assembling\nis but one activity in which certain associates might partake and,\nequally, it can be done by people who are not associates. Assembling\ncan be both a product of, and a Petri dish for, intimate and\nnon-intimate associations. A second reason to divorce assembling from\nassociating is to recognize properly that associative freedom includes\nintimate associations as well as collective and expressive\nassociations (Scheinin 1999: 420). Assembling has political\nconnotations. We prefer to speak of family members or congregations\n\u201cgathering\u201d, for example, or to describe an audience as\nbeing together \u201cin attendance\u201d (though we do speak of\nschool \u201cassemblies\u201d). \u201cAssembly\u201d we tend to\nreserve for activists, protesters, town hall members, or lobbyists. In\npolitics, people assemble in a physical space (we do not (yet) speak\nof people \u201cassembling\u201d on social media) usually to empower\nthemselves individually and collectively, and to make non-participants\naware of their energy, numbers, and intentions (Graeber 2013:\n35\u201354).\n2. Kinds of Freedoms\n\nSection 1\n above focuses on the nature and value of different kinds of\nassociations, within the home, at work, in the marketplace, at places\nof worship, and in the pub or club. It does not distinguish\nassociating from the freedoms to associate and\ndissociate. Here,\n \u00a72\n explores the nature of our associative freedoms, while\n \u00a73,\n \u00a74, and\n \u00a75\n explore these freedoms\u2019 forms, force, and value, as well as\ntheir various limitations.\n\nProminent liberal philosophers such as John Stuart Mill defend a broad\nnotion of freedom of association. Freedom of association is,\nfor Mill, one of the core domains of individual freedom. Mill says\nthat we have the freedom, in combination with other people, \u201cto\nunite for any purpose not involving harm to others: the persons\ncombining being supposed to be of full age and not forced or\ndeceived\u201d. He also says that we have \u201c\u2026the right to\nchoose the society most acceptable to us\u201d, free from government\ninterference (Mill 1859: ch. IV). The other core freedoms he\nidentifies are (1) freedom of thought, conscience, opinion and\nfeeling, that is to say, complete control over our own inner domain of\nconsciousness; (2) freedom of expression in speech and writing; and\n(3) freedom to shape our own lives according to our tastes and\npursuits in line with our character and inclinations; he embraced the\nidea that we engage in different \u201cexperiments in living\u201d.\nUnlike freedom of thought and opinion which are largely immune to\nMill\u2019s \u201cvery simple principle\u201d which we now know as\nthe harm principle, freedom of association is subject to this\nharm principle that we are permitted to interfere with someone\u2019s\nconduct only to prevent harm to others.\n\nMill\u2019s strong endorsement of associative freedom leaves many\nquestions unanswered since it pertains only to consenting adults\nacting with full information. As\n \u00a71\n makes clear, many of our core associations have a different\nstructure, as we could not consent to them. Especially in early\nchildhood, we do not choose, though we often come to embrace, our\nfamilial arrangements. Also, many of our closest, familial\nassociations can produce some often-unintended harm to others, since\nthese associations are necessarily exclusive and, hence, disregard\nnon-members\u2019 associative needs. Moreover, Mill\u2019s\nendorsement of free association among consenting adults may be too\nstrong. Not all mutually consensual associations can be protected by\nfreedom of association. Some consensual\nassociations\u2014such as a violently abusive marriage which neither\nspouse wishes to leave\u2014do not automatically fall under the gaze\nof Mill\u2019s harm principle, since his principle makes space for\naction that does affect other people with their free, voluntary, and\nundeceived consent and participation (Mill 1859: ch. I). But, such\nconnections are too morally opprobrious to merit protection from\nthird-party interference.\n\nMany contemporary moral and political philosophers analyze our\nindividual rights and freedoms with a conceptual apparatus developed\nby Wesley Hohfeld (1919), who identified eight normative positions\nwhich together make four pairs of correlates and four pairs of\nopposites. Claims correlate with duties.\nLiberties (or permissions), which are the opposite\nof duties, correlate with no-claims. Powers\ncorrelate with liabilities. And, disabilities, the\nopposite of powers, correlate with immunities, which are the\nopposite of liabilities. Using this Hohfeldian terminology,\nfreedom of association can refer to any one of the following\npositions and its correlate:\n\nPermission: We might be at liberty, i.e., have a moral or\nlegal permission, to associate or dissociate with other people. When\nwe have a permission to associate with, or dissociate from, someone,\nwe have no duty not to act, and, hence, correlatively, other people\nhave no claim upon us that we act otherwise. Moral and legal\npermissions do not always go hand in hand. An adult might have a legal\npermission to marry a child, but he has no moral permission to do\nso.\nClaim-right: We might have a moral or legal claim-right\nagainst others interfering with our conduct, which issues in a\nprotected sphere of action to associate with, or dissociate from,\npeople in certain ways even if we commit moral wrongs by doing so.\nWhen we have such a claim, others have a duty not to interfere, and\nmay have a duty positively to protect our sphere of action.\nPower: We might have a moral or legal power to alter our\nassociative status in relation to other people. The power to join an\nassociation can produce new rights and duties, or remove previously\nvalid rights and duties. When we marry someone, we exercise a power to\nalter both their normative status and our own by creating new claims,\nrights, duties, and powers. As parents, we have the power to decide\nwhether our children will be friends with other kids. If we divorce,\nwe exercise a power to alter our children\u2019s associative position\nin relation to us and possibly each other. When we have such powers to\naffect others\u2019 normative associative position, they have a\nliability to be affected by how we use our power.\nImmunity: We might have a moral or legal immunity against\nother people exercising their rights to association or dissociation in\nways that would alter our associative status. When we are immune,\nother people are disabled from exercising a power over us (Brownlee\n2015: 271; 2016a: 362). For instance, once we mature, our parents no\nlonger have the power to decide whether we\u2019ll associate with\ncertain people or not.\n\n\nThis Hohfeldian apparatus can be used to assess the specific rights\nthat comprise our freedom of association. These specific rights can be\nparsed as the right to exit, the right to exclude, and the right to\norganizational autonomy. Since our permissions, claim-rights, powers\nand immunities shift depending on the type of association under\ndiscussion, these rights will be discussed in connection with the\ndifferent associational types outlined in\n \u00a71.\n\nImportantly, these three rights\u2014to exclude, to exit, and to\nexercise organizational autonomy\u2014do not include a positive right\nto associate. These three rights all presuppose, however, that we\nalready belong to at least one association, since these rights can\nonly be exercised from within associations. If someone is\nexcluded from all associations, then the above framework does little\nto guarantee her any of the goods of associational life. The rights of\nassociation are important because they allow us some degree of control\nover how our lives go. However, precisely because the focus of these\nrights is our interpersonal relations, they can have the consequence\nof comprehensively excluding some people. There is, thus, an important\ntension between freedom of association and other possible goods of\nassociation. In getting to grips with this tension, it is necessary to\nassess the impact of employing the rights to exclude, exit, and\nexercise organizational autonomy across the different associational\nforms outlined above.\n\nSections\n \u00a73,\n \u00a74, and\n \u00a75\n consider, respectively, the content of the rights to exclude, exit,\nand exercise organizational autonomy, followed by considerations of\npossible limits to these rights which are necessary to protect or\nadvance other values.\n3. The Right to Exclude\n3.1 Intimate Associations\n\nAt some level, we must be able to exclude others from our\nassociations, especially our intimate associations: Families\nwouldn\u2019t be families if the competent members couldn\u2019t\nexercise some control over membership. Moreover, family members as\nindividuals would lack all manner of meaningful personal freedoms if\nthey could not control at least their own membership. Traditionally,\nand in many families today, not all competent family members enjoy\nequal power to determine membership. Patriarchs have long controlled\nwho is welcome within the family: for instance, casting out children\nwho failed to meet some standard of virtue. Denying other competent\nfamily members (equal) say over membership has far-reaching\nimplications. As much feminist literature confirms, to have even\nminimal control over their bodies and their lives, women need a right\nto exclude, where that includes the right to refuse a marriage\nproposal, the right to access contraception, the right to divorce, and\nindeed the right to choose not to spend private time with certain\npeople (Baylis and McLeod 2014). Arguably, both women and men also\nneed a positive right to reproductive assistance where that includes\nmeaningful rights to try to include new family members,\nnamely rights to try to bear children or to adopt children. Taking\nthese rights seriously means recognizing that they are all\nconcomitants of freedom of intimate association (Karst 1980; Mill\n1859).\nLimits to intimate exclusion\n\nA given family member\u2019s rights to exclude must, however, be\nchecked by other family members\u2019 rights to retain membership\nand, indeed, checked also by some non-members\u2019 rights to be\nsufficiently protected and cared for. First, parents have duties to\nensure that their children are adequately associatively-embedded,\nespecially if they\u2019re not going to be primary carers themselves.\nEven with the parents involved, there may be good reason to mitigate\nparents\u2019 \u201cmonopolies of care\u201d, by requiring\nstate-funded early-years childcare. Such mandatory childcare would\nreduce parents\u2019 abilities to control the terms of familial\nassociation, in effect obliging them to permit state intervention at\nthe level of the household (Gheaus 2018: 60).\n\nSecond, divorcing spouses cannot excuse themselves from all duties to\ntheir former partners, especially if that partner is caring for their\nchildren. There are, and should be, limits on the impact they can have\non other family members\u2019 associations with each other.\n\nThird, more contentiously, families might also have duties to look to\nthe associative needs of people who are bereft of close connection,\nfor example by fostering vulnerable children or housing refugees. In\ncrises situations such as the Blitz in Britain, many families living\noutside targeted areas were recruited to house evacuees, sometimes for\nthe duration of WWII. Given the urgency of the situation, these\nfamilies contributions are plausibly described in the language of\nduties and rights rather than that of\nsupererogation. Our \u201cobligatorily gregarious natures\ngive us basic needs to be with other people, especially when we are\nhighly dependent or vulnerable\u201d (Cacioppo & Patrick 2008:\n52). Put more strongly, our deep social needs identify a potential\nlimit both to our freedoms of association and dissociation and to our\ncontrol over the terms of our associations, to guarantee the goods of\nassociation to everyone when they need them (Liao 2015: ch. 3). A\nperson shunned by everyone when everyone exercises their right to\nexclude is denied these important goods (Brownlee 2016b). These basic\nneeds demand association with others, and this claim-right might\noverride others\u2019 permissions, claim-rights, and immunities to\nrefuse such association.\n\nTechnology or the market might provide a way for us to \u201chave our\ncake and eat it too\u201d, as they might offer us the means to\nnavigate simultaneously the often painful, boring, frustrating and\ndemanding labor of carrying out our associative duties and\nmaximizing our associative freedoms. For example, in a situation where\nrobots could be programmed to simulate, approximate or perhaps even\nsurpass in some ways, the kinds of reactions and behaviors typical of\nhuman beings, we can ask whether this could effectively replace the\nneed for humans to take on such work. In Japan, for instance, some\ncare homes have robots that can mimic human responses\u2014tilting\nheads to express sympathy, blinking to indicate\nreceptiveness\u2014which are being used to comfort lonely people, in\nlieu of their absent children or partners. In Japan again, busy adult\nchildren can hire actors to visit their aging parents, instructing the\nactors to pretend to be them. By doing so, both sides\u2014children\nand parents\u2014can perceive this as an effective means of\nnegotiating filial duties. Can such practices\u2014technological or\nmarket-based\u2014meet our basic associative needs while also\nmaximizing our associative choices, meaning that we get to spend time\nonly with those people with whom we really want to spend time? Or will\nsuch replacements inevitably fall short and, worse, eventually change\nthe meanings of what it means to care, such that we, in the words of\nSherry Turkle, come to expect more and more of technology and less and\nless of each other (Turkle 2011)? These thorny questions may become\neasier to answer as the relevant technologies and market initiatives\ncome into their own.\n3.2 Collective Associations\n\nThe importance of exclusion goes beyond the intimate settings of the\nfamily and friendships. It is also an integral part of\ncollective associations. For a devotional community,\nrecreational club, business club, union, or even nation to be what it\nis and to represent particular values, beliefs, or interests, it must\nbe able to determine, at least broadly, the criteria by which members\nare selected. This fact has limited states\u2019 rights to interfere\nwith certain groups\u2019 decisions about membership (Gutmann 1998a:\n6). However, the purposes of an association are open to reasonable\ndisagreement, and this often necessitates judicial interpretation and\ndecision (see Roberts v. United States Jaycees 468 U.S. 609\n(1984); Dale v. Boy Scouts of America 530 U.S. 640 (2000);\nJohnson 2001: 1641ff; Linder 1984).\n\nOne approach is simply to collapse all distinctions among different\ntypes of collective associations: associations are associations\nregardless of whether they are primarily expressive, commercial, or\ncreedal, and they should enjoy an absolute right over whom to admit,\nfor whatever reason they decide (Epstein 2008: 155). On this view, a\nnation, sports club, church, or business should devise its own rules\non who is in and who is out (Lomasky 2008: 184\u2013186). One\nargument for such a strong right is that only near or absolute freedom\nto exclude people adequately honors the great, inherent value of free\nassociation as something integral to the lives of free human beings\n(Kateb 1998: 37).\n\nBut, there are dangers in thinking that the right to exclude remains\nthe same, or even looks similar, across all forms of collective\nassociation. Exile from a nation differs radically from exclusion from\na sports club, which in turn differs markedly from ex-communication\nfrom a devotional community. A second approach interprets the scope\nand value of the right to exclude according to the primary goods and\nfunctions served by the relevant kind of association.\n\nExpressive associations are distinct for several reasons.\nFirst, they are intertwined with other basic rights of expression such\nas freedom of speech and freedom of religion (UDHR Articles\n18\u201319). A creed\u2019s right to exclude people, sometimes\ncashed out in terms of shunning, where excommunication involves being\nexcluded from familial associations as well (Greenawalt 1998: 142) is\noften justified in the name of worshipful or spiritual identity (i.e.,\nthe right of the Jews to be \u201cseparate\u201d or view themselves\nas \u201cchosen\u201d, the right of the Catholic Church to refuse to\nappoint women as bishops) as well as the secondary functions of a\ncreed to promote common identity, enhance internal harmony, expand the\nflock, raise funds, and gain further insight (Kymlicka 1995; Taylor\n1995). The limits of creeds\u2019 rights to exclude (or expel) are\nusually found in their harmfulness to non-members, whose interests,\nwhen push comes to shove, must take priority, in the name of equality\nof moral worth (White 1997: 383ff; Fine 2010: 352\u20133).\n\nSecond, expressive associations \u201care credited with enhancing the\nquality of democracy by cultivating citizenship and promoting open\nfora for public deliberation and self-government\u201d, opening up a\n\u201cparallel polis\u201d through a \u201cplurality of non-state\nsocial groups\u201d, by which the state can be kept in check and its\npowers limited (Craiutu 2008: 263\u20134; Levy 2014: 27). Put\ndifferently, one core function of many expressive associations or\n\u201cintermediate\u201d associations is to check the power of the\nstate. Intermediate groups give people an alternative to acting\nthrough the state. They enable people to act in concert and thereby\nmore easily resist the wrongful threats to personal freedom that\ngovernments can pose (Levy 2014: 1). An important part of preserving\nthis function of such associations is for a citizenry to become\naccustomed to the art of association, and to join with like-minded\npeople in the pursuit of what they perceive, in competition with\nothers, as the common good. This can only occur when groups are\nallowed to exclude people who have different understandings of that\ngood. In other words, to create genuine space for democratic dissent,\ngroups must be allowed to exclude people based on a principle of\nexpressive discrimination: such \u201cexpressive exclusion\u201d\nsits at the intersection of speech, association, and\ndemocracy (Bedi 2010).\n\nThird, expressive associations also have a role to play in increasing\nthe various \u201cexperiments of living\u201d to which people have\naccess. A plurality of opinions, creeds and ideologies increases the\nchance that people will find ways of life that suit them (Mill 1859:\nch. III). The diversity of ways of life that is fermented by allowing\ngroups to exclude people who fail to conform to their way of life, is\nsomething which also has collective value (Galston 1995: 523).\nHowever, Seana Shiffrin has argued for an alternative emphasis. In\nresponding to Dale v The Boy Scouts of America, in which the\nright of the Boy Scouts to exclude James Dale because of his\nhomosexuality was upheld, she suggests that we should think of such\nassociations less in terms of the messages they express to others,\ni.e., that the Boy Scouts as an institution does not endorse\nhomosexuality, and more in terms of the space that associations\nprovide. Specifically, associations offer a space for a person \n\n\nto control what influences she is exposed to, to what subjects she\ndirects her mind, and whether she, at all times, directs her mind\ntoward anything at all or instead \u201cspaces out\u201d and allows\nthe mind to relax and wander. (Shiffrin 2005: 841; cf. Farber 2001)\n\n\n\nIf we are constantly exposed to people or subjects with which we are\nunfamiliar or uncomfortable, or reminded of lifestyles or values that\nunsettle us, then a prime function of association is being upset. Of\ncourse, as we will see below, this associative protection might have\nadverse effects on other kinds of associative duty.\n\nCommercial associations vary from direct, tight-knit teams to\nlooser, long-distance networks. Commercial enterprises have as their\nmain purpose making, providing and selling goods and services to make\na profit. Employers have an interest in excluding people whom they\nregard as incapable of doing the job well because their work\nwon\u2019t be profitable. For the same reason, employers can have an\ninterest in excluding rabble rousers who aim to mobilize an otherwise\ncompliant workforce. Employees may well take a different view of their\nown interests with respect to their share of the profits, the optimum\npatterns of inclusions and exclusion within the enterprise, and the\ndegree of control they should have over shift-patterns, workload, and\nworking conditions (Nichols & Armstrong 1976: 82).\n\nThe differences in bargaining power between employees and employers\nhave led, historically, to the formation of particular kinds of\nassociations within the workplace. Trade unions form to protect\nemployees\u2019 position vis-\u00e0-vis their bosses, and\nthereby introduce some parity between these groups. In industries\nwhere conflict between capital and labor is pronounced, this can also\nissue in the right of unions to operate closed shops. In other words,\nanyone wishing to take employment must join the relevant union and,\nthus, employers can be denied access to potential employees who refuse\n(White 1998: 346\u2013347). Here then is a group right to compel\nassociation amongst a set of people\u2014with possible provisos for\nconscientious objectors\u2014to achieve the overall good of this\nassociational form, which is to make good on workers\u2019 basic\nrights (Rosenblum 1998; cf. Moreno 2008). However, implicitly, these\nmechanisms assume a particularly adversarial understanding of economic\nrelations, such that granting people this kind of group right can\nserve as a self-fulfilling prophecy, exacerbating what might otherwise\nbe congenial and mutually beneficial employer-employee relations. On\nsuch a view, the state might have to prevent freedom of association\namong the owners of capital, leading us into situations of monopoly.\nBut, beyond those kinds of provisions, the state should avoid\ninterfering with the spontaneous orderings that emerge from unimpeded\nassociation (Lomasky 2008; Epstein 2008; cf. Brody 1992 [1994:\n386]).\n\nExpressive and commercial associations are but two paradigms of\ncollective associations. The arguments for their right to\nexclude\u2014such as First Amendment-style rights or democracy in the\ncase of expressive associations and bargaining power within an\nadversarial relationship in the case of unions\u2014do not readily\napply to the activities of other collective associations such as\nrecreational groups, national groups, or cultural groups, which do not\nnecessarily qualify as expressive associations.\n\nRecreational associations: Members of a recreational group\nlike a chess club have interests in excluding people who would join\nwithout any intention of learning about chess or playing chess, but\nwith the (admittedly bizarre) desire to disrupt other people\u2019s\nenjoyment of the game. Minimal rules of inclusion are likely to refer\nto basic decency and decorum: a club might exclude people who swear\nprofusely during matches or react badly to losing. The right to\nexclude ensures the group can pursue such values as teamwork,\ncompetitive advantage, cohesiveness, autonomy, self-determination, and\nself-respect (McKinnon 2000: 498). In certain cases, a group may also\nwish to see a traditional pursuit continue because it is in danger of\nnot having enough adherents. Yet, the group might desire not just that\nthe pursuit survive, but that it survive for their group.\nThey might exclude some would-be participants so as to ensure the\nactivity is pursued by their specific community only. Were the\npractice to survive because of an increase in adherents outside this\ngroup, this might\u2014in the minds of members\u2014be a less\nvalued, even worthless result. Among other things, the group might\nregard the pursuit as a uniquely powerful means by which to bond\ntogether. This wish, though understandable at one level, becomes\nespecially troubling if exclusion is rooted in bigotry. The limits of\nsuch groups\u2019 rights to exclude turn largely on potential harms\nto non-members.\n\nCultural associations: Like commercial associations, cultural\nassociations vary from tight-knit clans to loose, anonymous\ncollectives. Cultural groups, sharing a common history, ethnicity,\nlanguage, and set of traditions, typically have distinct, persistent\nways of life. The Romani people, whose lifestyle is traditionally\nnomadic, are an example. Histories of colonization, conquest and\nannexation have destroyed many such groups\u2019 ways of life. Many\ncountries have laws banning, or hindering, a nomadic existence.\nHowever, though ravaged, the cultural practices and associational\nforms that make sense of members\u2019 conception of the good often\nremain in force. By preserving the associational forms of life that\nare organic to different communities, including their political\ndecision-making procedures and their patterns and practices of\ninclusion and exclusion, these cultural practices can also be made\nsustainable (Kymlicka 1995).\n\nNational and state associations: Given their size and nature,\nstates and nations seem to be peripheral examples of associations.\nNonetheless, if they are stable and enduring, they tick many of the\nboxes of meaningful association by offering a persistent, exclusive\nsocial context laden with common purposes that heavily inform our\nsense of identity. States use borders and border-control to exclude\nnon-members from their territories and to prevent them from acquiring\nmembership (Dagger 1985; Goodin 1988; Mason 1997: 442). Borders limit\nthe associative rights of people both within and without states\u2019\nboundaries. Such exclusion might be necessary to preserve a form and\nquality of citizenry-association that is conducive to a functioning\npolitical community. Of particular importance might be the need to\nsustain those forms of solidarity necessary to underpin social welfare\nprovisions (Miller 2016: 27). However, such exclusion can find its\nlimits when it bumps up against the basic human rights of would-be\nimmigrants. A state must justify its exclusionary practices before it\ncan justify treating its members better than it treats non-members. If\na state denies someone membership unjustifiably, it cannot appeal to\nthat person\u2019s non-membership to justify treating her less well\nthan it treats its members (Frick forthcoming).\nLimits to collective exclusion\n\nMeeting Basic Needs: As noted above, our freedom to associate\n(and disassociate) can often prevent particular people from enjoying\nthe goods of association since a person\u2019s positive right to\nassociate is shaped partly by other people\u2019s desire to associate\nor not with her. For some associations, this is not always\nproblematic. Friendship, for example, operates according to a mutual\ndesire to spend time together. Where this is lacking, a desire for the\nfriendship to be sustained, even from the person scorned, will likely,\nthough not always, dissipate. Unrequited love is another matter\naltogether. But, nobody believes that requiting love should\nbe imposed on anyone (though other associative duties might\nnonetheless emerge, perhaps with the end of letting the rejected\nperson down gradually).\n\nHowever, in certain contexts, our right to refuse to associate is\nhighly morally complex, such as when, for example, the excluded person\nhas a legitimate interest in the set of non-associative goods that we\nare denying her by excluding her. Take for example the right to\neducation. The Little Rock Nine who were turned away by National\nGuards at the doors of their school were primarily after a set of\ngoods, the value of which had nothing to do with association (Baldwin\n1958). The associational aspect was of little importance to either the\nstudents or their parents. Their right to an education and its\nopportunities conflicted with the alleged dissociative and expressive\nrights of the people who sought to deny them access to those goods.\nHere then, freedom of association was not really what was at stake.\nRather, the association was the means (more rightly perhaps, the\ncost) of claiming some other kind of right. The same\nprinciples can be applied to cases where someone seeks employment\namongst people with whom she would otherwise choose not to associate\n(cf. Lomasky 2008: 193ff).\n\nTake as another example the purposes served by recreational clubs.\nShould chess clubs be allowed to discriminate based on gender, for\nexample, in a boys\u2019 club that deprives interested girls of the\nopportunity to learn amongst peers and mentors, especially if no other\nchess club exists for girls to join? To suggest that the interested\ngirl is always free to set up her own chess club without trained\nmentors misses the point that chess is a game we learn best from\npeople already schooled in the activity and its tradition, and this\ncan often require resources to which she as an individual simply does\nnot have access (MacIntyre 1981 [1985: 194]). Given persisting biases\nabout whether girls can play chess well, a girls-only club, staffed by\nfemale mentors and peers, would be less problematic than a boys-only\nclub\u2014although there remain practical questions about how, in any\ngiven community, these are to be encouraged, established and\nmaintained. But, if perceptions changed such that society came to\ndoubt boys\u2019 ability to play chess at the highest levels, then\ngirls-only clubs would be more problematic than boys-only clubs. All\nthat said, new associations sometimes do form in reaction to the\nperceived prejudices of existing groups. In the wake of Dale v The\nBoy Scouts of America, new Scouting groups developed with more\ninclusive membership policies and more liberal ideas about who can be\na leader. While these groups might lack the historical prestige of the\nBoy Scouts of America, they at least solve the problem of\nscarcity.\n\nTake as a final example asylum seekers\u2019 fundamentally important\nneeds for assistance. Should nations\u2019 interests in\nself-governance take priority over such seekers\u2019 basic needs?\nGiven the intensity and severity of their needs, asylum seekers\u2019\nrights arguably take precedence over national interests in restricting\npeople\u2019s rights to free movement and association (Miller 2007;\ncf. Wellman 2008: 109). On the ground, this means that states must\nprocess applications of those asylum seekers who have reached their\njurisdiction. But, they do not have to open their borders to every\nperson anywhere in the world who is seeking refuge. Moreover, they may\nbe able to meet their obligations to such people without admitting\nthem to their own territories.\n\nAssociative Aspects of Other Personal Freedoms: When our\nright to exclude people prevents them from exercising other personal\nrights and freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion,\nand rights to educational opportunities, then a tension arises between\nthese competing freedoms. If someone is excluded from well-resourced\ngroups because of the color of her skin, then her ability to develop\nher \u201cpolitical opinions, engage in literary and artistic\npursuits and other cultural, economic and social activities\u201d (UN\nHuman Rights Council resolution 15/21, preamble) is undermined.\nEnsuring that her rights to equal respect, consideration, and fair\nopportunity are secured means protecting her from unjust\ndiscrimination by checking others\u2019 rights to be exclusive (White\n1997: 383ff).\n\nIn commercial domains, businesses can form, or refuse to form,\nassociations with certain customers through commercial exchanges. A\nbusiness might assert a right not to engage in certain kinds of\nexchanges with customers: the Christian owners of the Ashers Bakery in\nNorthern Ireland refused to bake a cake with a slogan supporting\ngay-marriage. Their objection, they said, was to the message\nfor the cake, not to the customers requesting the cake. By contrast, a\nblack photographer might assert a right to refuse a commission to\nphotograph a Neo-Nazi group that is holding a conference on their\nviews. In that case, her objection would be both to the message and to\nthe customers seeking her services.\n\nCompelling State Interest I (Equality): The state has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring that its citizens have access to those\ngoods that allow them to participate fully in the life of the\ncommunity. As such, the state has its own claim-rights and powers\ngrounded in these interests. Women\u2019s rights to gain access to\nthe privileges and advantages bestowed on members of commercial\ninstitutions, ethnic minorities\u2019 rights to live in safe\nneighborhoods irrespective of what local neighborhood associations\nmight fear (Anderson 2010), children\u2019s rights to attend properly\nequipped schools despite the racial prejudices of other students or\ntheir parents, and the rights of traditionally excluded groups to have\nemployment opportunities, all count as state interests that are\ncompelling enough to limit our rights to be exclusive. \n\nAnother potentially compelling interest we have is in being protected\nagainst the consequences of membership in our own\nassociations. There is a tension, for instance, between the demands a\ncommunity makes of its citizens and the impact that parental authority\ncan have on children\u2019s ability to learn about those demands.\nFocusing on the case of Wisconsin v Yoder (406 U.S. 205\n(1972)), which ruled that Amish parents\u2019 constitutionally\nprotected freedom of religion allowed them to take their children out\nof state education after the eighth grade, Richard Arneson and Ian\nShapiro note that these parents\u2019 wishes to remove their children\nfrom school after the eighth grade might interfere with their children\nlearning about the civic duties necessary to be effective members of\nthe wider political community, rendering them ill-equipped to\nparticipate in that community. In such cases, Amish children\u2019s\nassociative rights and concomitant duties as US citizens are adversely\naffected by their parents\u2019 desires to sustain their own\nassociative preferences (Arneson & Shapiro 1996; cf. Galston 1995:\n518\u2013520). More broadly, we can speak of children having a right\nto an \u201copen future\u201d, which includes rights to freedom of\nassociation. As Joel Feinberg puts it, a proper education\n\u201cequips the child with the knowledge and skills that will help\nhim choose whatever form of life fits his native disposition and\nmature disposition\u201d (Feinberg 1980 [1992: 84]). This open\nfuture, with its range of associative opportunities, is effectively\nforeclosed when a child is removed from a sufficiently advanced,\nformal education.\n\nIf the imperative to keep a child\u2019s future open is not weighed\nappropriately against parents\u2019 rights to influence their\nchild\u2019s development, oppressive consequences can follow. In\nXinjiang province in North West China, the state has taken active\nmeasures to prevent young people from the Uighur majority from\nengaging in Islamic practices, forbidding people under 18 from\nentering Mosques and preventing them from using their native tongue in\nclassrooms. In defending these policies, the Chinese state argues that\nit does this both to prevent what they perceive as the threat of\nterroristic activities (see d) below) and to keep open\nchildren\u2019s possibilities to grow up with a more open future than\nthey would have if they are inculcated in traditional Islamic\npractices. We can test the credibility of such defenses, specifically\nas they relate to threats of terrorism, by examining the community\nhistory, attitudes, and general behaviors of the people who are denied\naccess to those religious practices.\n\nCompelling State Interest II (Keeping the Peace): Exclusion\ncan serve the development of associations which make it their target\nto destroy the state and the social peace. Terrorist groups for\nexample will exclude people who are unsympathetic to the violent means\nthey advocate, even though they may share doctrinal or creedal\nsimilarities. Exclusion here thus allows particular beliefs and\nintentions to thrive unchallenged. Such exclusion conflicts also with\nboth other people\u2019s general rights to associate as they please\nand the other goods that social peace makes possible. As a result, a\n\u201ccompelling state interest\u201d can prevent certain\nassociations from forming or staying together. In some cases, the\nstate has a compelling interest to compel, i.e., force, associations,\nsuch as those achieved through desegregation, even when desegregation\ncan (and historically did) trigger violent responses. In other cases,\nthe state might claim that it has a compelling interest to prevent the\nfree associations of, for example, communists or anarchists of various\nstripes (Hook 1953; Whittington 2008).\n\nHowever, in connection with this \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d\ninterest, an array of other interests can be served or hindered when\nwe seek to justify state action against particular associations. For\ninstance, states and power-players sometimes use accusations of\n\u201cmoral disorder\u201d and \u201cthreats of anarchy\u201d\nagainst workers assembling for their rights to vote. Matthew\nArnold\u2019s reaction to the 1866 Hyde Park demonstrations, for\ninstance, described such demands as \u201ctending to anarchy\u201d\nand called that order be imposed on such assemblages for the sake of\ncivilization (Mitchell 2003: 13\u201314). Perception is an important\npart of \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d. Where a group of people\nperceive another group as a threat, keeping the peace might involve\nappeasing them in their false picture of reality. Alternatively, other\npeople might view seemingly disruptive associations as agitating for a\nmore just political settlement. What this shows is that an\nassociation\u2019s intentions always come with a certain level of\nopacity, which complicates the task of adjudicating between legitimate\nand illegitimate exercises of associative rights. It also complicates\nthe task of drawing the limits of those rights: When struggles ensue\nbetween certain groups and the state, the state often uses intrusive\ntactics to render those groups\u2019 aims transparent, such as police\ninfiltration, surveillance, discrediting, and disrupting, to manage,\nundermine or destroy such organizations. How we judge these state\nmeasures will ultimately depend on the seriousness of the perceived\nthreats that these groups pose.\n4. The Right to Exit\n\nNotwithstanding the threats posed by certain freely formed groups, the\nright to exclude is grounded in the belief that, for our associations\nto be valuable, they must be freely chosen in some measure (Kateb\n1998: 36). However, since not all associations operate according to\neither implicit or explicit declarations of consent, exactly what\ncounts as consent is a difficult thing to assess: How do we\nknow when association is free (Okin 2002)? This problem is exacerbated\nby the hierarchical form that many associations take. The paradigmatic\nexample of a hierarchical association is that between parents and\nchildren. But, hierarchy pervades other connections\u2014between\nolder and younger siblings, employers and employees, states and\ncitizens, and spouses. For some, the fact of acquiescence is\nsufficient for consent: if a person remains in an association, then\nshe seems to provide evidence that she consents to continued\nmembership. Regardless of how high the cost of leaving an association\nmight be, the person who remains does not exercise her right to exit,\nwhich she meaningfully has so long as she is not being physically\nrestrained, and, thus, she is properly describable as free (Kukathas\n2003: 113). According to this line of thought, a wife who is\npsychologically tormented by her spouse, suffering from extreme\npoverty, and terrified by the outside world as an inhospitable place,\nremains free to leave her husband.\n\nFor those who doubt that this extreme view is persuasive, the question\nbecomes how to make rights of exit realistic. Galston identifies four\nconditions for a meaningful right to exit: knowledge, capacity,\npsychological independence, and fitness. The first condition refers to\nbrute awareness that alternatives exist; the second refers to an\nability to assess those alternatives; the third to freedom from\npernicious forms of brainwashing and freedom to act on the results of\nthat assessment; and the fourth to the ability to move into and\nparticipate in other forms of life (Galston 1995: 525). When these\nconditions are met, we can conclude that the person has a meaningful\nright to exit, and the association passes a threshold that should be\nacceptable to liberals. Such conditions show that in many fundamental\nassociations, such as young children\u2019s family arrangement, it\nmakes no sense to talk of a right\u2014a freedom\u2014to exit.\nChildren are liable to the associative powers of their guardians, and\nusually this serves their best interests.\n\nIn the case of employer-employee associations, the right to exit\nmerits special attention since, for most of us, work is something we\nhave to do, though we have varying degrees of control over the kinds\nof work we do and, consequently, the people with whom we do it. When\nour choice is between doing truly awful work and starvation, our\noptions are severely limited. If we must\u2014on pain of\nsevere privation\u2014say \u201cyes\u201d to dirty, dangerous,\ndull, or degrading work, then we lack a meaningful option to exit. On\nthis view, genuine, or even minimal, freedom of association at work\nrequires that we have the ability to say \u201cno\u201d to all and\nany work (Widerquist 2013; Pateman 2007).\n\nIn the same way that we have limited exit-rights in our work lives, we\nhave limited exit-rights in our political lives as members of states\nand nations. As noted above, we cannot exit entirely from the realm of\nstate jurisdiction. We will always fall within the jurisdiction of\nsome state. And, to have a meaningful right to exit any one\nstate\u2019s jurisdiction, we must meet, if not exceed,\nGalston\u2019s tests of knowledge, capacity, independence, and\nfitness. In a nutshell, we must not only have the resources to leave,\nbut also be sufficiently appealing\u2014or be in sufficient\nneed\u2014that another state will accept us.\nLimits to the right of exit\n\nThe points above note some of the physical and psychological limits to\nour rights to exit. There are normative limits to these rights\ntoo.\nSupporting Dissent: The rights to remain: Over and above\nquestions of when exit is truly available, we can ask why excluders\nand people who push \u201cexiters\u201d out by imposing enormous\ncosts on them to stay, should have so resounding a say on cultural and\ngroup organization. For instance, instead of focusing on the\nimportance of women having the freedom to exit from their home,\ncommunity, or culture, we could focus instead on securing them a\nsignificant voice within their family\u2019s or culture\u2019s\nformations and practices (Okin 2002: 207). For example, we could focus\non why devout Catholic women who care deeply about their Church are\ndenied a significant role in the ecclesiastical affairs of that group,\nfor no reason other than their gender. For another example, we could\nask why empirically dubious claims about homosexuals\u2019 inability\nto lead should prevent people like James Dale from becoming Scout\nmasters. By focusing on the right to exit as an adequate measure of an\nassociation\u2019s members\u2019 freedom, we ignore the goods that\ncould be captured, and the justice done, by instead strengthening\npeople\u2019s rightswithin an association, which could force\nchange from within. Undeniably, this argument that people be supported\nto remain must be qualified, since it invites the state to dictate\nboth the membership and the internal rules of associations (an issue\nexplored below).\nResponsibilities to Dependents: In family life,\ncaregivers have responsibilities to dependents, both young and old,\nwhich can limit their rights to exit from those family connections.\nEven when caregivers do successfully pass the caregiving torch to\nothers, by outsourcing or formally transferring care duties, they\nusually cannot release themselves from all associative responsibility,\nbut must pay financially for the care of their (former) associates.\nAdditionally, if we adopt a strong view of the binding force of vows\nand promises, then caregivers lack the same kinds of exit rights that\nnon-caregivers have, or at the very least caregivers do serious moral\nwrong when they assert their exit rights.\nImportance of Education: As noted above, parents\u2019\ndesires for their children can often conflict with the important forms\nof socialization that children usually experience at school. The\nUnited Kingdom and France offer two different approaches to how far\nparents\u2019 control should impact on children\u2019s educational\nexperiences. France, with an undergirding principle of\nla\u00efcit\u00e9, offers an especially restrictive\nunderstanding of how far freedom of association may impact on the\ncurriculum, dress code and purposes of education (Laborde, 2006;\nGaleotti, 2002: 115\u2013137). At the other end, the UK\u2019s\nsupport of religious schools, although somewhat restricted with\nrespect to curriculum, permits broader scope for freedom of\nassociation. That said, both the UK and France, like most\njurisdictions, limit children\u2019s own right to exit from school\nbefore they reach a certain age of maturity. Whichever of these two\neducational strategies contributes best to forms of association more\nconducive to democratic citizenship is preferable in that respect to\nalternatives. This is potentially not a question that can be answered\nwithout attending to the economic, historical, and social fabric of\nthe community in question.\nLifestyle Decisions and Social Good: Members of gated\ncommunities exercise both rights of exit and of exclusion: they leave\nbehind the communities to which they did belong, often with the\nexpress intention of withdrawing contributions to which they believe\ntheir former communities have no entitlement. They also, as a\ncommunity, then decide on who gets to live in their newly formed\ncommunities. Indeed, the two rights, exit and exclusion, often exist\neither in tandem or as a fall-back. When parents remove their child\nfrom a desegregated school, their lack of a right to exclude prompts\nthem to exercise their presumably less preferred option of\nexiting.\n\nWhen people are segregated from one another for whatever reason, there\ncan be important reasons to limit their freedom of association, to\nencourage social mixing across class and race lines among other\nthings. When people employ their rights of exclusion and exit too\nreadily, and for reasons that conflict with equal citizenship, a\nsociety may need to resort to socially engineering certain forms of\nassociation, such as mixing rent-controlled and private housing, and\nshaping social space to encourage interactions among people of\ndifferent races, ages and classes. If trust is a necessary feature of\ndemocratic life, then the citizenry\u2019s habits and living patterns\nbecome an important resource. To generate this resource, a society\nmust attend to the concrete spaces of interaction wherein trust,\nrather than distrust, is more likely to emerge (Ryan 1998: 322). A\ncommunity divided into gated communities, racially-segregated suburbs\nand stigmatized ghettos is ill-equipped to provide space within the\nwider political association for trust to emerge (Anderson 2010: 34;\nAllen 2004: 165).\n5. The Right to Organizational Autonomy\n\nThe right to organizational autonomy intersects with both the right to\nexclude and the right to exit since, typically, associates want not\njust to do certain things together, but to do those things with\ncertain people and not other people. Indeed, in the eyes of many\nassociations, the things they do wouldn\u2019t be those same things\nif they couldn\u2019t exclude unwanted people from joining them, or\nif they couldn\u2019t exercise control over their own\nparticipation.\n\nMaintaining rights to organizational autonomy does not necessarily\nissue in liberal practices (Alexander 2008: 14). The right of the\nfamily to operate, unimpeached, according to patriarchal values, the\nright of unions to maintain hierarchical decision procedures, and the\nrights of churches to refuse women access to positions of authority,\nare all consequences of those associations being allowed to shape\ntheir organization without outside interference. These rights find\ntheir limits when they do indefensible harm to members, particularly\nto those members who cannot consent.\n\nFocusing on mutually voluntary associations, what kinds of\nassociations do we have the right to consent to join? And, what kinds\nof conduct do we have the right to engage in as associates? For\ninstance, can we have a right to voluntarily become a slave and our\nassociate the master, an association that would deny us all prospects\nto make other associative decisions even if our master treats us\nkindly? Less radically, do we have a right to consent to harmful\nrelations, such as sadomasochistic sexual relations, or to\nlife-threatening connections, such as a marriage with a highly\ncontagious asymptomatic carrier of typhoid or a marriage with a person\nwho suffers from psychopathy? Our answers will depend partly on how we\nconceive of autonomy. If autonomous agency cannot be\nself-negating, then we cannot voluntarily enslave ourselves or enter\nself-destructive relations. But, if we can autonomously do things that\neliminate all prospects for future autonomous agency such as seek\nvoluntary euthanasia, then why could we not autonomously form\nassociations that do or threaten the same thing?\n\nConsent can do the work to protect the internal operations of many\nassociations, even when the associates pose severe risks to each other\nand to themselves. But, there will be natural limits to these rights\nof organizational autonomy, despite worries about paternalism.\nLimits to the right to organizational autonomy\n\nWhen associations lack full rights to exclude or exit, they will\ninevitably lack full rights over their organizational autonomy. For\nmany years, orchestras have been required by convention to have\ncandidates audition behind a screen to ensure anonymity. The result\nhas been that orchestras have hired far more musicians from\ntraditionally under-represented groups than they did previously. In\nthe eyes of defenders of an all-male preserve like the Vienna\nPhilharmonic (which delayed admitting women as full members until\n1997, far later than any other leading orchestra), this changes the\ncharacter of the enterprise, and, some would say, costs it the vital\ncomradery and cohesion necessary for great orchestral work.\nUnsurprisingly, leading orchestras have found that wonderful work can\nbe produced by a diverse company of musicians. What matters is the\nperformers\u2019 musical ability and their ability to work well\ntogether. Their gender and ethnicity are, or should be, irrelevant to\nthose things.\n\nIn other spheres, however, features such as sex, gender or nationality\nare not irrelevant. A Taiwanese students\u2019 club at an American\nuniversity might accept, or be required to admit, non-Taiwanese\nstudents who are interested in that country. But, if non-Taiwanese\nstudents make up the majority of the club members or are running the\nshow, this will undoubtedly change the club\u2019s character and\npossibly compromise its intended organizational identity.\n\nAs already noted in connection with the right to exclude, the\nstate\u2019s compelling interests can justifiably limit\nassociations\u2019 rights to organizational autonomy (Johnson 2001).\nIn some respects, state interference with organizational autonomy is\ninevitably going to be more complex than state interference with\nassociations\u2019 efforts to exclude people: Here, the state is not\nsimply refusing, for instance, to give schools permission to bar\nstudents of color. Instead, the state is setting down limits to how\nfar a group can decide to organize itself. When the state gives an\norganization a quota that dictates how many women or people from\ndifferent ethnicities it must include, the state then insists on\nparticular patterns of inclusion. Quotas might thus be taken as an\ninstance of the state attempting to achieve more substantive forms of\nintegration. For instance, insisting on the inclusion of sufficiently\nlarge numbers of women in political parties and representative bodies\ncan aim to improve the democratic credentials of an overall\ninstitutional structure (Phillips 1998; Mansbridge 1999). Similarly,\nhaving a quota for the number of corporate board members who must be\nwomen, 40% in the case of Norway, can aim to achieve greater\nintegration as well as better working conditions for all women. In\nanother example, the US government worked to create less segregated\nschools, with programs such as Moving to Opportunity (MTO), and more\nintegrated neighbourhoods, with Chicago\u2019s Gautreaux Program.\nSuch actions can be described as attempts to bring about certain\npatterns of inclusion and connection within especially formative\nassociations, even though they sometimes go against the wishes of some\nparticipants (Anderson 2010: 119\u2013120).\n\nA potential limit to this imperative is presented by Tommie Shelby, in\nexplicit response to Elizabeth Anderson\u2019s argument for\nintegration. Shelby suggests that, in deeply unjust societies, ghettos\nperform important survivalist functions for their residents. They are\nspaces in which people can nourish a sense of community and a feeling\nof security from the familiarities of their own space, against a\nseemingly hostile outside world. To expect these residents, as\nAnderson does, to integrate into white neighborhoods is to potentially\nsacrifice those goods in the name of correcting for wider injustices,\nfor which these people are not responsible. Even if additional\n(though, empirically, potentially spurious) access to a wider field of\nsocial capital can become available by integrating, the people most\nburdened by injustice should not have to make additional sacrifices in\norder to amend those structural failures (Shelby 2016: 49\u201379).\nHere, the freedom to associate, and the functions served by already\nexisting associations, are given priority over the possibly beneficial\nassociative relations that could be developed once existing\nassociations are weakened. In addition to this freedom of association\nagainst interferences from the state, Shelby also describes the\nassociative duties and solidarities that come with\nliving in and belonging to ghetto communities (2016: 61).\nConclusion\n\nThis entry has distilled from the vast array of associations to which\nwe belong a taxonomy that highlights paradigmatic forms of association\nwhile noting how those forms overlap with each other. The entry\ndetails the values protected by the rights to exclude, to exit, and to\nexercise organizational autonomy, while also noting how, only by\nlimiting these rights, can other specific values, goods, and rights be\nachieved.\n\nThe values of association go far beyond what can be captured by\nreference to freedom of association and the rights and duties that\ngive shape to this freedom. Given our constitutive sociality, we are\ncreatures that come together with one another for all sorts of\nreasons: some good, some benign, and some nefarious. By looking to the\nwider field of values and functions performed by association, we can\nsituate freedom of association within a proper appreciation of the\ncomplex realm of associative life, and thereby gain a full sense not\nonly of the value of this freedom, but also of why such freedom might\nneed to be limited in order to pursue other values. Some of these\nalternative values will also be associative in nature (such as\nensuring simple connection to other humans, free or otherwise) and\nsome will go beyond associative values altogether, to include the\nvalues of security, equality or economic efficiency.\n",
