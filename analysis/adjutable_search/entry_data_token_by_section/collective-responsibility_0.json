    "main_text": "Collective Responsibility: the Controversies\n1. Collective Responsibility: the Controversies\n\nBoth notions of collective responsibility are controversial. The\ntraditional, backward looking, notion does not sit well with those who\nare skeptical about the ability of collective entities to\nwill and to act as collective entities. The forward\nlooking notion is less controversial than its backward looking\ncounterpart is with respect to its metaphysical foundations. But it\ndoes raise questions about how\u2014on the basis of what norms and\nprinciples\u2014we can ascribe such responsibility in practice.\n\nThree kinds of controversies surround the traditional notion of\ncollective responsibility.\n\nThe first of these controversies concerns whether or not collective\nresponsibility makes sense as a form of moral responsibility. Not\nsurprisingly, the primary focus of attention here has been with both\nthe moral agency of groups in general and the possibility of group\nintentions in particular. How, participants in this controversy have\nasked, can we understand the notion of collective responsibility as a\nmatter of moral\u2014and not just causal\u2014responsibility? Is it\npossible for groups, as distinct from their members, to cause harm in\nthe sense required by moral responsibility? to act as collectives? to\nhave intentions? Is it possible for groups, as distinct from their\nmembers, to be morally blameworthy for bringing about harm? to be\nguilty as moral agents?\n\nThe second controversy, interestingly enough, is not really about the\nmoral responsibility of groups at all, even though it is couched in\nthe language of collective moral responsibility. Instead, it is about\nthe moral responsibility of individuals who belong to groups that are\nthemselves thought to be morally responsible for particular cases of\nharm. How, participants in this controversy have asked, can we\ndistribute collective responsibility across individual members of such\na group? Does it makes sense to distribute collective responsibility\nin general? Is it appropriate to hold individual group members morally\nresponsible for harm that other group members caused? that the group\nitself caused? that the group as a whole failed to prevent? If so,\nunder what conditions and with respect to what particular kinds of\ngroups? Random collections of individuals? Interest-based groups?\nCorporate entities?\n\nThe third controversy is primarily normative and concerns the value of\nascribing collective responsibility in practice. In some cases, the\nconcern is with the general practice of collective responsibility and\nits consequences for our ability to sustain the values of\nindividualism, freedom, and justice. In other cases, the concern is\nwith the ascriptions of collective responsibility in particular\ncontexts, e.g., in the contexts of war tribunals, reparations for\nslavery, terrorism, and rape, and with whether such ascriptions are\nproductive and/or fair to those being blamed. What would happen,\ncritics ask, if we were to replace individual responsibility with\ncollective responsibility? Would we be letting individuals off the\nhook? Would we be eroding the practice of personal responsibility in\ngeneral?\n\nThe controversies surrounding forward looking collective\nresponsibility have to do with both the role of agent causation in\nascribing responsibility for remedying harm in the world and the norms\nand principles that may\u2014or may not\u2014be appropriate to\ninvoke in this context. Does responsibility for remedying harm come\ndown to who caused the harm? If not, what other criteria should we\nemploy? Should we turn to those who are most capable of preventing the\nharm and hold them\u2014and the community of which they are a\npart\u2014responsible for remedial action? (Is forward looking\ncollective responsibility primarily an exercise in pragmatism?) Do\nconsiderations of fairness have any place in our ascriptions of such\nresponsibility and, if so, what kinds of fairness are relevant? What\nhappens in cases where there is no collective entity capable of taking\nremedial action? Do we have a moral obligation to bring such a\ncollective entity about and, if so, on what basis?\n",
