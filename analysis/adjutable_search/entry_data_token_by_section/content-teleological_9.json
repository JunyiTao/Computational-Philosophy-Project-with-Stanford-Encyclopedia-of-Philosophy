    "main_text": "Problems for Teleosemantics || Functional Indeterminacy\n4.1 Functional Indeterminacy\n\nThere are several potential indeterminacy problems (for a survey, cf.\nNeander 2017, ch. 7). In addition to the problem of distal content,\nwhich has already been discussed above two other indeterminacy\nproblems are especially prominent. \n\nThe first, raised by Fodor (1990b), is the problem of locally\nco-instantiated \n properties.[19]\n Fodor\u2019s example is the familiar case of the frog that snaps at\nanything that is suitably small, dark and moving and thereby feeds\nitself (see \n section 3.2). \n For the sake of the argument, Fodor makes\nthe (unrealistic) assumption that the property of being small, dark\nand moving and the property of being a fly are always co-instantiated\nin the frog\u2019s environment, such that all flies are small, dark,\nmoving things, and vice versa. According to Fodor, if it was adaptive\nfor the frog to snap at flies then it was equally adaptive for it to\nsnap at small, dark, moving things. Hence, when we look at the\nfrog\u2019s detection device, we can equally well say that the\nfunction of the device is to detect flies and that its\nfunction is to detect small, dark, moving things. So, if we try to\ndetermine the content of the representation by reference to the\nfunction of the detection mechanism, the content remains\nindeterminate. We can choose to describe the function one way or\nanother but if the content depends on how we choose to describe the\nfunction it is not a naturalized content. Note that the candidate\ncontents there\u2019s a fly and there\u2019s frog\nfood and there\u2019s a small, dark moving thing each\nlicense different assessments concerning misrepresentation. If the\nfrog is representing the stimulus as a fly, for instance, it will\nmisrepresent a small, dark, moving non-fly as a fly. If it represents\nthe stimulus as a small, dark, moving thing, this will not be the\ncase.\n\nThe second prominent indeterminacy problem is the problem of\nproperties mutually implicated in selection. It stems from the fact\nthat traits are selected for complex causal roles. Consider, for\nexample, an antelope population where an altered hemoglobin shape was\nselected for because it (i) increased oxygen uptake, (ii) which\nallowed the antelopes to move to higher ground, (iii) which gave them\naccess to richer pasture in summer, (iv) and so improved their\nnutritional status, their immunity to disease, their vigor in avoiding\npredation, their attraction to mates and (v) their chances of survival\nand reproduction (Neander 1995). To determine the function of a trait,\nsuch as the altered shape of the hemoglobin, the etiological theory of\nfunctions tells us to ask, \u201cwhat did past instances do that was\nadaptive and that caused traits of that type to be selected?\u201d.\nIn this case, the answer is (i) through (v). The altered shape of the\nhemoglobin did all of this, and all of this was adaptive, and all of\nthis contributed to the selection of the trait (i.e., it was selected\nfor all of this). So all of this would seem to be the\ntrait\u2019s \n function.[20]\n Its function is the complex causal role for which it was\nselected.\n\nThe problem for content can be seen when we consider mechanisms that\nproduce or consume representations. For instance, the frog\u2019s\ndetection device was selected because it (a) responded to small, dark,\nmoving things and (b) that helped the frog catch these things, and (c)\nthat provided the frog with nutrients and (d) that contributed to the\nfrog\u2019s chances of survival and reproduction in various ways.\nThus ancestral detection devices contributed to the selection of that\ntype of device by way of a complex causal route in which the visible\nconfiguration of the stimulus and the nutritional properties of the\nstimulus both play a role. Note that this does not depend on these\nfeatures of the environment being locally co-instantiated. Even if not\nall small, dark and moving things were nutritious and not all\nnutritious things were small, dark and moving in the frog\u2019s\nnatural habitat, this problem of complex causal roles would still\nremain. The problem is that the systems responsible for the production\nand the consumption of representations were selected for complex\ncausal roles in which a number of environmental features were\ninvolved.\n\nWhile these two problems might be fatal to simple teleological\ntheories of content, it is clear that the theories which are currently\nat the center of discussion have ample resources to deal with them. On\nNeander\u2019s causal-information theory, for example, the content of\nthe frog\u2019s sensory-perceptual representation is not\nindeterminate between there\u2019s a small, dark, moving\nobject, there\u2019s a fly and there\u2019s frog\nfood (whether the relevant properties are locally co-instantiated\nor not). The reason is that the frog\u2019s visual system was not\nselected for producing the relevant sensory-perceptual representation\nin response to objects of order Diptera (flies), or\nto objects with nutritional value (frog food). A frog\u2019s visual\nsystem is not causally sensitive to an object\u2019s nutritiousness,\nor to its membership in the order Diptera, and could not have\nbeen selected for a causal sensitivity it did not have (see \n section 3.4). \n The same holds, mutatis mutandis, for Millikan\u2019s\nteleological theory, which entails that the frog\u2019s\nrepresentation has the content there\u2019s frog food rather\nthan there\u2019s a fly or there\u2019s a small, dark,\nmoving object (see \n section 3.2). \n\nOf course, whether these ways of resolving the indeterminacies are\nultimately successful or whether they give rise to further, more\nserious problems is a matter of debate. Some theorists who are\nskeptical of the prospects of Neander\u2019s and Millikan\u2019s\nsolutions have thus proposed alternative answers to the problems of\ncontent indeterminacy, especially to the more serious problem of\nproperties mutually implicated in selection.\n\nNicholas Agar (1993), for instance, supports the idea that the\nfrog\u2019s representation means there\u2019s small, dark,\nmoving frog food, a content intended to incorporate all of the\nproperties causally responsible for the selection. By contrast, Manolo\nMart\u00ednez (2013) argues that it is not these properties\nthemselves that enter into the content of the frog\u2019s\nrepresentation, but the natural kind (understood as a\n\u2018homeostatic property cluster\u2019) that accounts for the\nfrequent co-instantiation of these properties. According to this\nproposal, the content of the frog\u2019s representation would be\nsomething like there\u2019s a fly. (This content ascription\nis also favored by Artiga 2019, who synthesizes Mart\u00ednez\u2019\napproach with Millikan\u2019s biosemantics, and extends it to\nrepresentations that do not refer to natural kinds.)\n\nFinally, some proponents of teleological theories do not think that\ncontent is determinate in the cases used to illustrate the alleged\nproblem. Dennett (1995) maintains that such content indeterminacy is\nunproblematic. Papineau (1998) maintains that content is indeterminate\nin the case of a creature that lacks a belief-desire psychological\nstructure (although he abandons this position later in Papineau 2016).\nMore recently, Bergman (2021) has argued that content indeterminacy in\nthe frog case is acceptable, because (i) it is a type of indeterminacy\nthat is comparatively \u2018well-behaved\u2019, more like vagueness\nthan like other, more radical forms of semantic indeterminacy and (ii)\nthere are good reasons to suppose that the indeterminacy does not\ngeneralize to the propositional attitudes of human beings. According\nto Bergman, this is an attractive position, not least because it can\nexplain why theorists continue to disagree about what the correct\ncontent ascription in the frog case is.\n",
