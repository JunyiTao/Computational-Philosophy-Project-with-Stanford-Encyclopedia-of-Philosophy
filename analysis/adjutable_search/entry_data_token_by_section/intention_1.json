    "main_text": "Intention in Action\n2. Intention in Action\n\nIf prospective intention cannot be explained in terms of intentional\naction, or both in terms of being in progress, how can we preserve the\nunity of our three divisions? In particular, how does intentional\naction relate to prospective intention and intention-with-which? There\nare two obvious thoughts. The first is that doing A\nintentionally is doing it with some further intention, or doing\nsomething with the intention of thereby doing A. The second\nis that both phenomena are to be explained in terms of intention as a\nmental state. Let us take these possibilities in turn.\n\nThe idea of explaining intentional action through intention-with-which\nis associated with resistance to causal accounts of acting for a\nreason. It begins instead with intentional teleology\u2014doing\nA in order to do B, or with the intention of doing\nB\u2014treating this as primitive and not involving\nintention as efficient cause. If we assume that every intentional\naction is done for a reason, and that this reason can be cast in\nteleological form, we can identify doing A intentionally with\ndoing A in order to do something else. We thereby unify two\nguises of intention.\n\nDifficulties arise, however, from the case of idle behaviour, in which\nI am doing A intentionally for no particular reason (Anscombe\n1963, p. 25), and from the possibility\u2014or necessity\u2014that\nteleological series come to an end. I am doing A in order to\ndo B in order to do C \u2026 in order to do\nZ, which I am doing for its own sake. Not all intentional\nactions are performed with a further end. The purported unity fades.\nIn order to solve this problem while leaving room for basic\nintentional actions, not performed by intentionally taking further\nmeans, George Wilson (1989) and Carl Ginet (1990, Ch. 6) appeal to\nintention de re. One need not intend one\u2019s doing\nA to promote some further end in order to count as doing\nA intentionally. It is sufficient to intend, of something one\nis doing, that it promote or constitute one\u2019s doing\nA.\n\nThis way of putting things prompts the objection that merely having\nthat intention is not enough. If the intention is idle or ineffective,\none will not, despite one\u2019s wishes, count as doing A\nintentionally, or as acting in order to do A (Mele 1992, pp.\n248\u201355). We need to add a causal relation, after all. But this\nobjection misconstrues the teleological view. It is not that the mere\npresence of a mental state\u2014intending of \u2026 that it\n\u2026\u2014constitutes acting with an intention, or acting\nintentionally, but that intention-with-which is a basic form of\nteleology, distinct from causation by a mental state, out of which we\ncan construct the unity of intention.\n\nA deeper problem for the teleological approach is how to complete this\nconstruction with an account of prospective intention in terms of\nintention-with-which. In cases of pure intending, there is no\nintention with which I am doing anything yet. It is thus no accident\nthat Wilson (1989, pp. 222\u201330) is led to deny the possibility of\npure intention. When I intend to do A in the future, I am\ndoing something now with the intention of doing A, in that I\nintend, of what I am doing, that it promote or constitute my doing\nA. The action in question may be as minimal as keeping track\nof opportunities for doing A, or biding my time.\n\nFinally, the teleological theorist must account for the connection\nbetween intentions with which one acts and psychological states of\nbelief and desire. Why does it follow from the fact that one intends,\nof what one is doing, that it promote or constitute one\u2019s doing\nA that one wants to do A and that one believes, of\nwhat one is doing, that it is a means to that end? These implications\nmake sense if intention is a species of desire that interacts with\nmeans-end belief when one does A with the intention of doing\nB. They are more difficult to explain if intention-with-which\nis the basic material from which intention and intentional action are\nbuilt. (This argument is developed at greater length in Setiya 2011,\npp. 146\u20139.)\n\nPressures of this kind push us towards the second approach, now\northodox in action theory, which aims to explain both intentional\naction and intention-with-which in terms of intention as a mental\nstate. According to the simplest possible view, an intentional action\nof doing A is the execution of a prior intention to do\nA, and doing A with the intention of doing\nB is intending, of one\u2019s doing A, that it\npromote or constitute one\u2019s doing B.\n\nA note of caution is essential here: it is important to distinguish\nthe more modest project of explaining what it is to act intentionally\nin terms of intending and doing from the more ambitious project of\nexplaining what it is for S to act intentionally in terms of\ngoings-on of which S is not the agent. The latter project is implied\nby Wittgenstein\u2019s notorious arithmetic: \u201cWhat is left over\nwhen I subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that I\nraise my arm?\u201d (Wittgenstein 1953, \u00a7621). Some philosophers\nattempt to answer this question, explaining what it is to do\nA intentionally without appeal to doing A. But one\nneed not share that aim in giving an account of intentional action in\nterms of intention as a mental state: one can take for granted that I\nam raising my arm, for instance, and ask what more is involved in\nraising my arm intentionally (Setiya 2011, \u00a72; Setiya 2016b, pp.\n3\u20139).\n\nEven the more modest project runs into difficulties. First, although\nwe sometimes form an intention prior to acting, this is not essential.\nI can wave my arm intentionally without planning in advance. This fact\nelicits a refinement often credited to Searle (1983, pp. 84\u20135):\nthe distinction between prospective intention and intention in action.\nIn the former case, one intends to do A, perhaps at some\npoint in the future. In the latter, one intends to be doing it now.\nWhen S is doing A intentionally, she is doing it in\nexecution of an intention in action, though except in very unusual\ncases she also intends to do A: to complete the action she is\nin the midst of performing.\n\nThis refinement preserves the idea that doing A intentionally\nrequires an intention whose object is doing A. This is what\nBratman (1987, p. 112) has dubbed \u2018the Simple View.\u2019 It is\nopen to serious objections, the more subtle of which will be examined\nin section 4. For now, it is sufficient to note that I sometimes count\nas doing A intentionally when it is a merely foreseen and\nunintended consequence of what I intend to do. (See Harman 1976, pp.\n151\u20132; Bratman 1987, pp. 123\u20135.) Thus if I am paid to pump\nwater into the cistern of a house, and I continue to do so even when I\nrealize that the water is poisoned, I poison the inhabitants of the\nhouse intentionally, despite the fact that I did not intend or desire\nsuch harm (cf. Anscombe 1963, pp. 41\u20132). Even here, however, an\nintention is executed: I intend to pump water into the house. In\ngeneral, when it is not the execution of a directly corresponding\nintention, doing A intentionally is a foreseen or desired\nconsequence of an action that is. Admittedly, this condition is\nnecessary, not sufficient, for intentional action, a concept whose\nvagaries are hard to map. But the execution of intention remains the\ncore phenomenon from which all instances of intentional action are\nderived.\n\nAlong with such matters of detail, two problems of principle can be\nraised against the present approach. The first contends that it is\ntacitly circular, because the content of intention always includes the\nconcept of intentionality (Wilson 1989, pp. 274\u20135; Ginet 1990,\npp. 34\u20135). In prospective intention, I intend not only to do\nA, but to do A intentionally, and the same\npoint holds for the object of intention in action. This prevents us\nfrom explaining what it is to act intentionally in terms of intention\nas a mental state. Alternatively, one might hold, as Anscombe (1963,\n\u00a747) apparently does, that for some values of\n\u2018A\u2019\u2014as perhaps, paying, hiring, or\nmarrying\u2014it is essential to doing A that one do it\nintentionally (see Ford 2015; Setiya 2016a).\n\nThe force of this objection is unclear. While there is something wrong\nwith an account of what it is to \u03c6 that appeals to being or doing\n\u03c6, it is not so obviously problematic to appeal to mental states\nthat represent something as being or doing \u03c6. Our task is\nnot to introduce the concept of intentional action to someone who\nlacks that concept, but to spell out the metaphysics of doing\nA intentionally. It is an open question whether\n\u2018metaphysical definition\u2019\u2014saying what it is to\n\u03c6\u2014can be permissibly circular, so long as the circularity is\ncontained in the scope of an attitude. Such circularity is\ncharacteristic of \u2018response-dependent\u2019 accounts of\nevaluative and other properties. (This response may fail if the\nattitude in question is knowledge; see Ford 2011, \u00a74.)\n\nA more direct response to the challenge would deny its premise. While\nit is true that the execution of intention is intentional action, it\ndoes not follow that the object of intention is doing\nA intentionally (cf. Searle 1983, pp. 85\u20136). If I\nintend to be smiling and am doing so involuntarily, I am doing what I\nintend, though not intentionally. Likewise, if I intend to skip\nbreakfast and do so because I forget about it, my intention was\nfulfilled, though not by intentional action. Even paying, hiring, and\nmarrying are things one can do unintentionally; intentionality is not\nbuilt into the object of intention in a way that makes for circularity\n(see Beddor and Pavese forthcoming, \u00a76, responding to\nPi\u00f1eros Glasscock 2020). This point is consistent with the view\nthat, when I act for reasons, those reasons figure in my intention as\na Kantian \u2018maxim\u2019. In that case, my intention is\nfulfilled, in its entirety, only if I act on them and thereby act\nintentionally. (See Wallace 1999, pp. 60\u20132; Setiya 2007a, pp.\n39\u201349; Korsgaard 2008; Schapiro 2011; and, for resistance,\nSinhababu 2013, \u00a73. On the content of intention, more generally,\nsee Harman 1976, pp. 156\u20138; Velleman 1989, pp. 94\u20137; Mele\n1992, Ch. 11; and Ross, pp. 255\u20137, Appendix B.)\n\nThe second problem is more a question: whether \u2018the relation of\nbeing done in execution of a certain intention, or being\ndone intentionally, is a causal relation between act and\nintention.\u2019 (Anscombe 1983, p. 95) Anscombe denies that it is.\nWhen she writes of \u2018practical knowledge\u2019 as \u2018the\ncause of what it understands\u2019 she means formal not efficient\ncause: practical knowledge is essential to the action it represents,\nat least when \u2018the description of the action is of a type to be\nformally the description of an executed intention.\u2019 (See\nAnscombe 1963, pp. 87\u20138, and for conflicting interpretations:\nHursthouse 2000; Vogler 2002; Moran 2004; Newstead 2006; Velleman\n2007; Paul 2011; Ford 2015; Schwenkler 2015; Lavin 2016; Setiya 2016a;\nCampbell 2018a; Campbell 2018b.)\n\nOne source of concern about intention as efficient cause is that\nintention need not precede intentional action, while causes must\nprecede their effects. But causal theorists may deny that claim about\nthe temporality of causes, conceiving intention as the simultaneous,\nsustaining cause of what one is doing (Thalberg 1984, pp. 257\u20138;\nSetiya 2007a, pp 56\u20139).\n\nA more common anxiety turns on \u2018causal deviance\u2019 (Davidson\n1973, p. 79). If we are trying to say what it is to act intentionally,\nthe condition of doing A because one so intends looks\ninsufficient. For it says nothing about the causal path from intention\nto action. If I intend to be shaking in order to signal my\nconfederate, and this intention makes me nervous, so that I shake, I\nam shaking because I so intend\u2014though not intentionally. My\nintention did not cause me to shake \u2018in the right way.\u2019\nNor is the \u2018right way\u2019 obviously a matter of\n\u2018proximate\u2019 causation or the absence of causal\nintermediaries, since a causal theorist may well allow for neural\nintermediaries, and further intentions, in the causal path from\nintention to action. There is a failure of intentional action only\nwhen the intermediaries are of the wrong kind.\n\nReactions to causal deviance vary widely. Some are convinced that the\nproblem is hopeless (Anscombe 1989, pp. 110\u20131; Wilson 1989, Ch.\n9; O\u2019Brien 2007, Ch. 8). Others aim to solve it by\ndistinguishing deviance in the causation of non-basic actions,\nperformed by intentional means, from deviance in basic intentional\naction. The former happens when things do not happen as we planned;\nthe latter can be solved by appeal to forms of causal direction or\nguidance found outside the province of intentional action (Thalberg\n1984; Mele 1992, Ch. 11; Setiya 2007a, pp. 31\u20132, Hyman 2014).\nBut the existence of basic intentional actions is disputed (Lavin\n2013), as is their internal structure or teleology (Valaris 2015;\nSmall 2019).\n\nIt is in any case unclear how the dispute about causal deviance bears\non the project of explaining intentional action through intention as a\nmental state. Would that project survive if the relation of execution\nand the corresponding \u2018because\u2019 were taken as primitive?\nOr in a \u2018disjunctive\u2019 theory according to which intention\nin action has two distinct forms: doing A intentionally and\n\u2018mere\u2019 intending, frustrated by the world? Like the theory\nof intending as being embarked upon intentional action, the\ndisjunctive conception agrees with Aristotle that action is, or can\nbe, the conclusion of practical thought.\n\nCorresponding issues have been pursued in the philosophy of\nperception, where causal and disjunctive theories are often opposed\n(as by Snowdon 1980\u20131), and in epistemology more broadly.\nInstead of explaining knowledge as belief that meets further\nconditions, some epistemologists treat knowledge as basic, explaining\nmere belief as its defective form (McDowell 1995; Williamson 2000).\nThe parallel view of intentional action treats mere intending as a\ndefective form of intentional action (O\u2019Brien 2007; R\u00f6dl\n2007, Ch. 2; McDowell 2010, \u00a77; Marcus 2012, Ch. 2; Levy 2021). A\nquestion for this view is how the state of intending can be a form of\nsomething dynamic: the event or process of acting. To answer this\nquestion, we need to say more about the kind of state intention\nis.\n",
