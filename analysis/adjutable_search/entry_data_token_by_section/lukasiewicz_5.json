    "main_text": "Propositional Logic || Intuitionistic Logic\n4.3 Intuitionistic Logic\n\n\u0141ukasiewicz was interested in intuitionistic logic, not least\nbecause, like his own, it rejected the law of excluded middle. In a\nlate article published in 1952, he gave an elegant axiomatization with\nten axioms, using the letters \\(F\\), \\(T\\) and \\(O\\) for the\nintuitionist connectives of implication, conjunction and disjunction\nrespectively, in order to obviate clashes caused by\n\u201ccompetition\u201d for the connectives, though interestingly he\nkept the usual negation for both systems. He then showed how to define\nclassical implication as \\(NTpNq\\), formulated this definition using a\nvariable functor as the implication \n\\[ \\begin{align}\n& F\\delta NTpNq\\delta Cpq \n\\end{align} \\]\n\n\nand proved that in this version classical bivalent logic based on\n\\(C\\) and \\(N\\) is contained in intuitionistic logic, provided that\ndetachment is confined to \\(C\\)-\\(N\\) formulas only. Classical\nconjunction and disjunction can be defined in the usual way as\n\\(NCpNq\\) and \\(CNpq\\) respectively. By differentiating intuitionistic\nfrom classical connectives his perspective reverses the usual one that\nintuitionistic propositional calculus is poorer in theorems than\nclassical: in \u0141ukasiewicz\u2019s formulation it is the other way\naround.\n",
