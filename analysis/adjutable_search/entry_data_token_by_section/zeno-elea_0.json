Life and Writings\n\n\nThe dramatic occasion of Plato\u2019s dialogue, Parmenides, is a \nvisit to Athens by the eminent philosopher Parmenides and Zeno, his \nyounger associate, to attend the festival of the Great Panathenaea. \nPlato describes Parmenides as about sixty-five years old, Zeno as \nnearly forty, and Socrates, with whom they converse, as \u201cquite \nyoung then,\u201d which is normally taken to mean about twenty. \nGiven that Socrates was a little past seventy when executed by the \nAthenians in 399 B.C.E., this description suggests that Zeno was born \nabout 490 B.C.E. He would appear to have been active in Magna Graecia, \nthat is, the Greek-speaking regions of southern Italy, during the \nmid-fifth century B.C.E. There is otherwise little credible information\nabout the circumstances of his life. Diogenes Laertius\u2019s brief \n\u201cLife of Zeno\u201d (D.L. 9.25\u20139) is largely taken up with \nstitching together conflicting reports of his involvement in a brave \nplot to overthrow one of the local tyrants, but how much truth these \nreports contain cannot be determined. Although Diogenes also says \nthat Zeno so loved his native Elea that he had no interest in \nimmigrating to Athens, this report is not inconsistent with his \nhaving spent some time there; and Plutarch\u2019s report that Pericles \nheard Zeno expounding on the nature of things in the manner of \nParmenides (Plu. Pericles 4.5) suggests that Zeno may indeed\nhave visited Athens and read his famous book, as Plato\u2019s \nParmenides implies, to a group of intellectually keen \nAthenians. Vivid evidence of the cultural impact of Zeno\u2019s arguments \nis to be found in the interior of a red-figure drinking cup (Rome, \nMus. Villa Giulia, inv. 3591) discovered in the \nEtrurian city of Falerii and dated to the mid-fifth century B.C.E. It \ndepicts a heroic figure racing nimbly ahead of a large tortoise and \nhas every appearance of being the first known \u201cresponse\u201d \nto the Achilles paradox.\n\n\nPlato\u2019s Parmenides depicts Socrates going as a young man to \nhear Zeno reading from the famous book he has brought to Athens for \nthe first time. Parmenides himself and some others, including \nPythodorus (the dramatic source of Plato\u2019s report) are portrayed as \nentering toward the end of the reading so that they hear only a \nlittle of Zeno\u2019s recitation. Plato then presents an exchange between \nSocrates and Zeno, the first part of which is as follows:\n\n\nOnce Socrates had heard it, he asked Zeno to read the first hypothesis\nof the first argument again, and, after it was read, he said:\n\u201cWhat do you mean by this, Zeno? \u2018If the things that are\nare many, that then they must be both like and unlike, but this is\nimpossible. For neither can unlike things be like, nor like things\nunlike\u2019? Is this not what you say?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d\nsaid Zeno. \u201cThen if it is impossible both for things unlike to\nbe like and for like things to be unlike, then it\u2019s also impossible\nfor there to be many things? For if there were many things, they would\nincur impossibilities. So is this what your arguments intend, nothing\nother than to maintain forcibly, contrary to everything normally said,\nthat there are not many things? And do you think that each of your\narguments is a proof of this very point, so that you consider yourself\nto be furnishing just as many proofs that there are not many things as\nthe arguments you have written? Is this what you say, or do I not\nunderstand correctly?\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Zeno,\n\u201cbut you have understood perfectly well what the treatise as a\nwhole intends\u201d (Pl. Prm. 127d6\u2013128a3).\n\n\nWhile the dialogue\u2019s scenario, and thus this exchange, are clearly \nfictional, this passage is nonetheless normally taken as indicating \nthat Zeno composed a single treatise comprising numerous arguments, \ncast in the form of antinomies, all purporting to demonstrate the \nuntenability of the commonsense presumption that there are many \nthings. \n\n\nWhile the later tradition unreliably ascribes other works to Zeno, \nthere is some interesting evidence in the commentary on the \nParmenides by the Athenian Neoplatonist Proclus (5th c. \nC.E.) that he was familiar with a work transmitted under Zeno\u2019s name \ncontaining forty arguments or logoi (Procl. in Prm.\n694, 17\u201318 Steel). Much of what Proclus says about Zeno in his \ncommentary simply recasts what is already present in the above \nexchange, but this comment that this work of Zeno\u2019s contained forty \narguments, taken with certain other things he says, suggests that \nProclus had access to a work with some sort of Zenonian pedigree, a \nwork known to earlier commentators as well (as evidenced by Procl. \nin Prm. 630.26ff., especially 631.25\u2013632.3). If there was a \nwork available in later antiquity entitled The Forty Arguments of\nZeno, it is however unlikely to have been a fair replica of any \noriginal treatise of Zeno\u2019s. In the first place, some of Proclus\u2019 \napparent references to this work suggest that it fathered upon Zeno \narguments akin to some of those in Parmenides\u2019 own elaborate \ndialectical exercise later in the Parmenides. Furthermore, \nAristotle implies that people were reworking Zeno\u2019s arguments soon \nafter they were first propounded. In Physics 8.8, after \ngiving a basic reconstruction of the so-called Stadium paradox (see \nbelow, sect. 2.2.1) recalling its presentation in Physics \n6.9, Aristotle then notes that some propound the same argument in a \ndifferent way; the alternative reconstruction he then describes \n(Arist. Ph. 8.8, 263a7\u201311) is in effect a new \nversion of the original argument.\n\n\nReturning to the Parmenides passage, it should also be noted\nthat Socrates\u2019 description of Zeno\u2019s book, which Plato has Zeno \nendorse, indicates that its arguments had a certain structure and \npurpose. Specifically, the passage indicates that all Zeno\u2019s \narguments opposed the common-sense assumption that there are many \nthings. It might also suggest that these arguments took the form of \nantinomies like the one Socrates specifically cites, so that the \ngeneral pattern of Zeno\u2019s argumentation would have been: if there are\nmany things, these must be both F and not-F; but \nthings cannot be both F and not-F; therefore, it \ncannot be the case that there are many things. Although this \ndescription has inspired some to attempt to accommodate the extant \nparadoxes (of motion, plurality, and place) within a unified \narchitecture that would have provided the plan for Zeno\u2019s original \nbook, if in fact he wrote only one, none of these attempts have \nproved convincing. Since Plato\u2019s description is in a number of \nrespects difficult to square with what we know from other sources of \nZeno\u2019s actual arguments, one should be wary of making it the basis \nfor hypotheses regarding the book\u2019s plan of organization. For one \nthing, the paradoxes of motion reported by Aristotle do not evidently\ntarget the assumption that there are many things, nor do they take \nthe form of antinomies. Moreover, only one of the arguments against \nplurality elsewhere reported, the antinomy of limited and unlimited, \nconforms to the pattern of argumentation exemplified in the antinomy \nof like and unlike described by Plato\u2019s Socrates (see below, 2.1.1). \nThe remaining argument, the antinomy of large and small (see 2.1.2), \npurports to show not only that the assumption that there are many \nthings leads to an apparent contradiction, but, rather more \nambitiously, it purports to reduce each of the contradictory \nconsequences to absurdity. Plato does not actually state, of course, \nthat all Zeno\u2019s arguments took the form of antinomies. In the end, if\nthe characterization of Zeno\u2019s treatise by Plato\u2019s Socrates in the \npassage above is not quite accurate, there remains no more plausible \nview from antiquity regarding the general thrust of his arguments, to\nthe extent that there may have been a single one. One can, moreover, \neasily broaden Socrates\u2019 specification of the target to encompass the\narguments against motion and place by changing it to the slightly \nmore complex thesis that there are many things that move from place \nto place. Socrates might easily have been taking it for granted that,\nfor Zeno, such motion goes along automatically with plurality. What \nwe know of Zeno\u2019s arguments certainly accords with the notion that \nthey were meant to challenge ordinary assumptions about plurality and\nmotion. His arguments are quite literally \n\u201cpara-doxes\u201d\u2014from the Greek para \n(\u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201cagainst\u201d) and \ndoxa (\u201cbelief\u201d or \n\u201copinion\u201d)\u2014arguments for conclusions contrary to \nwhat people ordinarily believe. What more there might be to say about\nZeno\u2019s purposes will be discussed below, after presentation of what \nwe know of his actual arguments.\n",
