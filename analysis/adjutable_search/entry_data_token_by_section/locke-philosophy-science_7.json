    "main_text": "Tension in Locke\u2019s thought and a consequent debate || Limitations of the corpuscular hypothesis\n3.2 Limitations of the corpuscular hypothesis\n\nThis section examines the four phenomena that Locke seems to consider\ntoo obscure for the corpuscular hypothesis to illuminate. The\nabove-quoted passage mentioned three of these phenomena\u2014 the\nproduction of sensation, the communication of motion, and\n cohesion.[19]\n Locke discusses the fourth, gravity, only outside the\nEssay.\n3.2.1 Sensation\n\nAs we saw in passages discussed earlier, in connection with\nscientia\u2019s impossibility, Locke finds the production of\nsensation to be utterly obscure. One side of the difficulty is the\nnature of the mind. While in all probability, it is immaterial, Locke\nallows the possibility that God superadded the power of thought\ndirectly to matter. The other side of the difficulty concerns the\nnature of secondary qualities as powers to produce sensations. The\nappeal of the corpuscular hypothesis lay largely in its reductive\npromise. Reduction was expected particularly for secondary qualities,\nsuch as colors and sounds, but was also anticipated for ideas of\nmacro-level primary qualities, including visual sensations of shapes\nand sizes, and tertiary qualities. All would be reduced to the primary\nqualities of bodies\u2019 component corpuscles as they interact with\none another and our perceptual systems.\n\nOne part of the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s purported explanation\nis conceivable, namely, the interactions among the primary\nqualities of bodies, which are supposed to be part of the causal basis\nof our sensations:\n\nThat the size, figure, and motion of one Body should cause a change in\nthe size, figure, and motion of another Body, is not beyond our\nConception; the separation of the Parts of one Body, upon the\nintrusion of another; and the change from rest to motion, upon\nimpulse; these, and the like, seem to us to have some\nconnexion one with another (E IV.iii.13, p. 545).\n\n\nIndeed, we are capable of discerning necessary connections in two\ninstances, as noted earlier. (One case involves only primary\nqualities\u2014 \u201cFigure necessarily presupposes\nExtension\u201d (E IV.iii.14, p. 546)\u2014while the other involves\ntertiary and primary qualities\u2014\u201creceiving or communicating\nMotion by impulse, supposes Solidity\u201d (E IV.iii.14, p. 546).) If\nwe knew more about the primary qualities of bodies, we might multiply\nsuch instances: \u201cAnd if we knew these primary Qualities of\nBodies\u2026we might be able to know a great deal more of these\nOperations of them one upon another\u201d. That is, if we knew real\nessences, we could derive more necessary connections, to know the\ncausal relation between opium and sleep, for instance, and as\ncertainly as we now know that impulse requires solidity.\n\nStill, knowing real essences would not give us any genuine knowledge\nof how sensations are produced by primary qualities. While\ncorpuscular theorists such as Galileo (The Assayer) sketched\na reductive account of our sensations of taste in terms of particles\nstriking our tongues, Locke suggests that any attempt to discover the\nprocess\u2019s details will be foiled. For as far as we can imagine,\na body that strikes other bodies can produce \u201cnothing but\nMotion\u201d\n [20]\n (E IV.iii.6, pp. 540\u2013541), and motion may itself be hopelessly\nobscure, as indicated below. The roles of shape and size are equally\nobscure; we cannot imagine how they could help produce sensations.\n\nWe are so far from knowing what figure, size, or motion of parts\nproduce a yellow Colour, a sweet Taste, or a sharp Sound, that we can\nby no means conceive how any size, figure, or motion of any\nParticles, can possibly produce in us the Idea of any\nColour, Taste, or Sound whatsoever; there is no\nconceivable connexion betwixt the one and the other (E\nIV.iii.13, p. 545).\n\n\nAlthough Locke mentions only secondary qualities here, his point\npresumably applies to all sensations, including our sensations of\nmacro-level primary qualities, such as the shape and size of a\nsnowball or lump of gold. For again, genuine knowledge is knowledge of\nnecessary connections, with the conceptual relations in geometry being\nthe model, and it does not seem possible to discover such connections\nbetween any sensation and the sizes, shapes, and textures that are\nalleged to cause them. Macro-level primary qualities to micro-level\nones and accordingly resemble\n them.[21]\n but the idea of a quality is nonetheless very different than the\nquality itself.\n\nLocke finds that our only way of understanding the production of\nsensation is to attribute the process to God. If we try to understand\nhow motion could produce a color, sound, or taste, \u201cwe are fain\nto quit our Reason, go beyond our Ideas, and attribute it\nwholly to the good pleasure of our Maker\u201d (E IV.iii.6, p.\n540\u2013541; see also IV.iii.28, p. 559). Locke was certainly not\nalone in grappling with this problem. Commenting upon\nDescartes\u2019s account, Walter Charleton (1654, p. 197) had\nobserved earlier that even a detailed knowledge of light behavior\nwould still leave us with the \u201csuperlative difficulty\u201d of\nunderstanding why a certain reflection or refraction should be\n\u201ctransformed into a Vermillion rather than a Blew,\u201d and\nfurther details about our sensory apparatus do not reveal \u201cany\nAnalogy betwixt the Retina Tunica \u2026 and any one\nColour\u201d. Locke was also not alone in resorting to a divine\ncause; in De gravitatione\u2019s creation account of bodies,\nfor example, Newton suggested a divine basis for bodies\u2019\nabilities to stimulate perceptions in minds.\n3.2.2 Gravity\n\nNewton\u2019s Principia implied the possibility of\nunmediated action at a distance, and with its publication, gravity\nbecame the most nettlesome phenomenon for the orthodox version of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis due to its proviso of contact action. Locke was\ninitially sympathetic to the proviso, writing in the first three\neditions of his Essay, \u201cHow bodies operate one upon\nanother\u2026is manifestly by impulse and nothing else. It being\nimpossible to conceive that body should operate on what it does\nnot touch\u201d (E II.viii.11, editions 1\u20133). Yet for the\nfourth edition, he replaced that claim about how bodies do operate\nwith one about how we can conceive of them operating: \u201cHow\nBodies produce ideas in us is manifestly by impulse,\n[this being] the only way which we can conceive Bodies [to]\noperate\u201d (E II.viii.11, edition 4). He also omitted a clause\ndenying unmediated action at a distance, which had appeared in\nII.viii.12 of previous\n editions.[22]\n These subtle emendations reflect a dramatic shift, one expressed\ndirectly in his correspondence with Stillingfleet.\n\nThe gravitation of matter towards matter, by ways inconceivable to me,\nis not only a demonstration that God can, if he pleases, put into\nbodies powers and ways of operation, above what can be derived from\nour idea of body, or can be explained by what we know of matter, but\nalso an unquestionable and every where visible instance, that he has\ndone so (Second Reply to the Bishop of Worcester, 1699,\nThe Works of John Locke, Vol. IV, p. 467).\n\n\nThe phenomenon of gravity\u2014as explained by \u201cMr.\nNewton\u2019s incomparable book\u201d\n(ibid.)\u2014apparently led Locke to abandon the contact\naction proviso and to attribute to matter the power of acting\ndistantly, even though he considered the process by which such\ninteractions could occur so obscure that it drove him to invoke\nsuperaddition. This is the prevailing interpretation of Locke (and was\nassumed by Leibniz, who targeted Locke for it in Against Barbaric\nPhysics), though not all commentators agree, as indicated in a\nsubsequent section.\n3.2.3 Motion\n\nLocke takes the notion of impulse, in which bodies communicate motion\nto one another by surface impact, to be, along with extension and\ncohesion, fundamental to our concept of\n body.[23]\n Indeed, regardless of how motion may actually be communicated,\nimpulse is the only means by which we can conceive of its being\ncommunicated, a view of our conceptual abilities that Locke maintains,\nas we saw, despite his changing thoughts about gravity. Impulse is\nalso fundamental to the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s explanation of\nphenomena, being either the exclusive means of interaction among\nbodies, as adherents of the contact action proviso hold, or the means\nof at least many interactions. Yet how exactly does a moving body\ncommunicate motion to a resting one simply by impacting it? When we\nattempt to discover the precise nature of the process, Locke suggests,\nwe find that it is just as mysterious as the process by which the mind\nmoves the body.\n\nAnother Idea we have of Body, is the power of\ncommunication of Motion by impulse; and of our Souls, the\npower of exciting of Motion by Thought\u2026. But if here\nagain we enquire how this is done, we are equally in the\ndark. For in the communication of Motion by impulse, wherein as\nmuch Motion is lost to one Body, as is got to the other, which is the\nordinariest case, we can have no other conception, but of the passing\nof Motion out of one Body into another; which, I think, is as obscure\nand unconceivable, as how our Minds move or stop our Bodies by\nThought\u2026.The increase of Motion by impulse, which is observed\nor believed sometimes to happen, is yet harder to be understood. We\nhave by daily experience clear evidence of Motion produced both by\nimpulse, and by thought; but the manner how, hardly comes within our\ncomprehension; we are equally at a loss in both (E II.xxiii.28, p.\n311).\n\n\nSince the corpuscular hypothesis holds impulse to be the primary if\nnot the sole means by which bodies causally interact, then any\nphenomenon that the corpuscular hypothesis purports to explain by\nimpulse will remain obscure if impulse itself remains obscure. All of\nthe hypothesis\u2019s reductions of observable primary, secondary,\nand tertiary qualities, would inherit impulse\u2019s obscurity; thus\nLocke appears to be suggesting here that the corpuscular hypothesis\ncannot fulfill its promise of explaining and reducing those properties\nand powers.\n3.2.4 Cohesion\n\nSince the claim that observable bodies are made up of particles is\ncentral to the corpuscular hypothesis, an immediate question for its\nproponents asks how the particles cohere into compound bodies.\nPlenists have some resources for answering that question, though those\nresources may introduce worse difficulties. Descartes, for instance,\nthough he speaks in terms of particles, understands an individual body\nas an area of extension moving as one with respect to surrounding\nareas. It is not possible for any particle to move away into empty\nspace, there being no such thing as empty space once matter is\nidentified with extension; with every bit of matter pressed from all\nsides by other matter, there is no problem about cohesion per se,\nthough there is certainly a problem about individuating bodies from\none another. In the same vein, Malebranche can invoke the pressure of\nthe air to explain the coherence of bodies, and then invoke the\npressure of an aether to explain the coherence of air particles. Locke\nobjects that this explanation fails because it leaves us with the\nquestion of what causes the particles of the aether to cohere (E\nII.xxiii.23, p, 308). The objection reveals Locke\u2019s atomist\nsympathies, drawing its power from the presumption that there is such\na thing as empty space into which the aether particles could move. The\nproblem for atomist versions of the corpuscular hypothesis is that the\nrestricted set of properties that they allow the particles\n\u2014size, shape, and motion\u2014provides no obvious resources for\nexplaining how the particles cohere with one another to form compound\nbodies. In various forms, the problem about cohesion has dogged\natomists since ancient times.\n\nThe problem arises in two forms, which, to borrow James Hill\u2019s\nterminology (Hill 2004), may be called the limited and the\nfoundational problems. The limited problem, arising for those who take\ncorpuscles to be genuine atoms, that is, to be indivisible, is the\nproblem of explaining how those indivisible corpuscles cohere with one\nanother. This is the problem one finds in Newton\u2019s writings.\nAlthough Rule 3 of the Principia allows the possibility that\nthe least parts of matter could turn out to be divisible, his atomist\nsympathies are evident throughout his writings. He speculates in Query\n31 that in all probability, bodies are made up of hard particles that\nonly God could divide, and in the body of the Opticks (Book\nII, Part III, Proposition VII) he suggests that more powerful\nmicroscopes might permit us to see the larger particles. In answer to\nthe problem of how those naturally indivisible particles cohere, he\nrejects the ancient solution of hooked particles as begging the\nquestion, proposing instead some short-range forces modeled on the\ngravitational force (Query 31). Newton\u2019s speculations about such\nforces are driven by an absence of any resolution to the problem about\ncohesion within the corpuscular theory itself.\n\nThe foundational problem pushes the question about cohesion into the\ncorpuscles themselves. The problem was raised by Joseph Glanvill:\n\u201cIf it be pretended\u2026that the parts of solid bodies are\nheld together by hooks, and angulous involutions; I\nsay, this comes not home: For the coherence of the parts of\nthese hooks\u2026will be of as difficult a conception, as\nthe former\u201d (Glanvill, The Vanity of Dogmatizing, p.\n18, quoted in Hill 2004, p. 616). Without any grounds for asserting\nthat the divisibility of matter bottoms out in indivisible corpuscles,\nthen, the question arises of how the parts of a corpuscle could\ncohere, how the parts of those parts could cohere, and so on, ending\nin the question of how extended bodies are possible at all.\n\nWhatever his ultimate view of the corpuscular hypothesis, Locke\ninevitably faces the atomist\u2019s problem about cohesion, accepting\nas he does void space (see II.xiii.11, 12\u201314, 21\u201323), and\nholding that our ideas of body depend fundamentally upon cohesion. One\nof the ideas \u201cproper and peculiar\u201d to body, he writes, is\n\u201cthe cohesion of solid, and consequently separable\nparts\u201d (E II.xxiii.17, p. 306), and the extension of\nbody, as opposed to the extension of space, is \u201cnothing, but the\ncohesion or continuity of solid, separable, moveable Parts\u201d (E\nII.iv.5, p. 126). Yet we have no understanding of cohesion, and so our\nidea of body does not rest on any genuine understanding of it. In\ntrying to understand how bodies are extended, we are as much in the\ndark as when we try to understand how the soul thinks.\n\n\u2019Tis as easie for him to have a clear\nIdea, how the Soul thinks, as how Body is extended. For since\nBody is no farther, nor otherwise extended, than by the union and\ncohesion of its solid parts, we shall very ill comprehend the\nextension of Body, without understanding wherein consists the\nunion and cohesion of its parts; which seems to me as\nincomprehensible, as the manner of Thinking, and how it is performed\n(E II.xxiii.24, p. 309).\n\n\nOne scholarly debate about cohesion concerns the question of whether\nLocke acknowledged only the limited problem, as one would expect from\ncommentators who read him as accepting atomism (e.g. Mandelbaum 1964,\np. 1), or whether he looked further, to the more serious, foundational\nproblem, as Hill argues (2004). A related controversy, to be discussed\nin the next section, concerns the question of whether Locke concludes\nthat the corpuscular hypothesis simply cannot resolve the problem\n(e.g., Hill 2004; Downing 2007, p. 408) or instead remains agnostic on\nthe issue (e.g., McCann in Chappell 1998, p. 244).\n\nThe four problematic phenomena winnow away the components of the\ncorpuscular hypothesis, as defined at the outset of this article. The\nproblem about sensation threatens the corpuscular hypothesis\u2019s\npromise of reducing secondary, tertiary, and macro-level primary\nqualities to microlevel primary qualities. Newton\u2019s results\nabout gravitational phenomena cast grave doubts upon the contact\naction proviso, and according to some commentators, those results led\nLocke to abandon the belief that impulse is the only means of causal\ninteraction. A corpuscular theorist might hope to preserve some part\nof the theory by insisting that impulse is still the means by which\nmost other causal interactions are effected; but this runs up against\nthe problem about impulse, in that the process by which motion is\ncommunicated seems utterly obscure. Finally, even the core claim that\nobservable bodies are composed of tiny corpuscles is threatened by the\nproblem of cohesion. This last problem threatens to be the most\nserious of four phenomena, for as James Hill has pointed out (2004, p.\n628), the problems about gravity, sensation, and motion arise\nsubsequent to our having conceived of body, whereas the problem about\ncohesion may thwart our very ability to conceive clearly of body.\n",
