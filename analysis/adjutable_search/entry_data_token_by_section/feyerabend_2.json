    "main_text": "Feyerabend\u2019s Early Life || Youth (1924 \u20131938)\n2.1 Youth (1924 \u20131938)\n\nPaul Karl Feyerabend was born into a middle-class Viennese family in\n1924. Times were hard in Vienna in the nineteen-twenties: in the\naftermath of the First World War there were famines, hunger riots, and\nrunaway inflation. Feyerabend\u2019s family had a three-room\napartment on the Wolfganggasse, \u201ca quiet street lined\nwith oak trees\u201d (p. 11). The first chapters of his autobiography\ngive the impression of his being a strange child, whose activities\nwere entirely centred around his own family, and who was cut off from\nneighbors, other children and the outside world because \u201c[t]he\nworld is a dangerous place\u201d (p. 15). Between the ages of three\nand six, Feyerabend recalls, he spent most of his time in the\napartment\u2019s kitchen and bedroom. Occasional visits to the cinema\nand numerous stories, especially stories with a magical aura, seem to\nhave taken the place usually filled by childhood friends. He was a\nsickly child, but ran away from home once, when he was five years old\n(p. 7). When he started school at the age of six, he \u201chad no\nidea how other people lived or what to do with them\u201d (p. 16).\nThe world seemed to be filled with strange and inexplicable\nhappenings. It took him some while to get used to school, which\ninitially made him sick. But when he did so, his health problems had\ndisappeared. When he learned to read, he found the new and magical\nworld of books waiting for him, and indulged himself to the full (p.\n25). But his sense of the world\u2019s inexplicability took some time\nto dissipate\u2014he recalls feeling that way about events during the\nnineteen-thirties and throughout the second world war.\n\nFeyerabend attended a Realgymnasium (High School) at which he\nwas taught Latin, English, and science. He was a\nVorzugssch\u00fcler, that is, \u201ca student whose grades\nexceeded a certain average\u201d (p. 22), and by the time he was\nsixteen he had the reputation of knowing more about physics and math\nthan his teachers. But he also got thrown out of school on one\noccasion.\n\nFeyerabend \u201cstumbled into drama\u201d (p. 26) by accident,\nbecoming something of a ham actor in the process. This accident then\nled to another, when he found himself forced to accept philosophy\ntexts among the bundles of books he had bought for the plays and\nnovels they contained. It was, he later claimed, \u201cthe dramatic\npossibilities of reasoning and\u2026 the power that arguments seem\nto exert over people\u201d (p. 27) with which philosophy fascinated\nhim. Although his reputation was as a philosopher, he preferred to be\nthought of as an entertainer. His interests, he said, were always\nsomewhat unfocussed (p. 27).\n\nHowever, Feyerabend\u2019s school physics teacher Oswald Thomas\ninspired in him an interest in physics and astronomy. The first\nlecture he gave (at school) seems to have been on these subjects (p.\n28). Together with his father, he built a telescope and \u201cbecame\na regular observer for the Swiss Institute of Solar Research\u201d\n(p. 29). He describes his scientific interests as follows:\n\nI was interested in both the technical and the more general aspects of\nphysics and astronomy, but I drew no distinction between them. For me,\nEddington, Mach (his Mechanics and Theory of Heat),\nand Hugo Dingler (Foundations of Geometry) were scientists\nwho moved freely from one end of their subject to the other. I read\nMach very carefully and made many notes. (p. 30).\n\n\nFeyerabend does not tell us how he became acquainted with another one\nof his main preoccupations\u2014singing. He was proud of his voice,\nbecoming a member of a choir, and took singing lessons for years,\nlater claiming to have remained in California in order not to have to\ngive up his singing teacher. In his autobiography he talks of the\npleasure, greater than any intellectual pleasure, derived from having\nand using a well-trained singing voice (p. 83). During his time in\nVienna in the second world war, his interest led him to attend the\nopera (first the Volksoper, and then the Staatsoper)\ntogether with his mother. A former opera singer, Johann Langer, gave\nhim singing lessons and encouraged him to go to an academy. After\npassing the entrance examination, Feyerabend did so, becoming a pupil\nof Adolf Vogel. At this point in his life, he later recalled: \n\nThe course of my life was\u2026 clear: theoretical astronomy during\nthe day, preferably in the domain of perturbation theory; then\nrehearsals, coaching, vocal exercises, opera in the evening\u2026;\nand astronomical observation at night\u2026 The only remaining\nobstacle was the war. (p. 35).\n\n",
