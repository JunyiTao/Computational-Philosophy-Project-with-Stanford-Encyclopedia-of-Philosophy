    "main_text": "Paradoxes of Identity || Chrysippus\u2019 Paradox\n2.2 Chrysippus\u2019 Paradox\n\nThe following paradox\u2014a variation of the paradox of\nchange\u2014raises some new questions. It is due to the Stoic\nphilosopher Chrysippus (c. 280 BCE \u2013 c. 206 BCE) and has been\nresurrected by Michael Burke (1994). In Chrysippus\u2019s example,\n\u201cDion\u201d is the name of a human and \u201cTheon\u201d is\nthe name of the proper part of Dion that includes everything but his\n[Dion\u2019s] left foot. Dion then loses his foot and Chrysippus\nwishes to know which of those objects\u2014Dion or\nTheon\u2014survives after Dion loses the foot. Burke\u2019s example\nis to suppose that, at some point \\(t'\\) in the future, poor Oscar\nwill lose his tail. He then considers the proper part of Oscar, as he\nis now (at \\(t)\\), consisting of the whole of Oscar minus his tail.\nCall this object \u201cOscar\u2212\u201d. According to\nthe standard account of identity, Oscar and Oscar\u2212\nare distinct at \\(t\\) and hence, by ND, they are distinct at \\(t'\\).\n(Intuitively, Oscar and Oscar\u2212 are distinct at \\(t'\\)\nsince Oscar has a property at \\(t'\\) that Oscar\u2212\nlacks, namely, the property of having had a tail at \\(t\\). Notice that\nthis argument involves a tacit appeal to ND\u2014or NI, depending on\nhow you look at it.) Hence, if both survive, we have a case of two\ndistinct physical objects occupying exactly the same space at the same\ntime. Assuming that is impossible, and assuming, as commonsense\ndemands, that Oscar survives the loss of his tail, it follows that\nOscar\u2212 does not survive. This conclusion is\nparadoxical because it appears that nothing happens to\nOscar\u2212 in the interval between \\(t\\) and \\(t'\\) that\nwould cause it to perish.\n\nThe first group of solutions does not take into consideration the\namputation event that occurred at \\(t'\\) when they account for what\nexists\u2014you may dub them untemporalized solutions. One\nextreme option in this category is to deny that there are such things\nas Oscar\u2212. Undetached proper parts of objects\ndon\u2019t exist (van Inwagen 1981). A less extreme version allows\nfor commonsense undetached parts, like tails or feet\u2014of course\nOscar\u2212 does not belong to this category, so it does\nnot exist (Carmichael 2020). On the other hand, a more extreme option\nis to deny the existence of both Oscar and\nOscar\u2212\u2014this may follow from some reductionist\nview like the one that only elementary particles exist. A third, less\nextreme, option is to insist that objects of different kinds,\ne.g., a clay statue and the piece of clay it is composed of,\ncan occupy the same space at the same time, but objects of\nthe same kind, e.g., two statues, cannot (Wiggins 1968; for\nrefinements, see Oderberg 1996). So Oscar and Oscar\u2212\nare different despite the fact that from \\(t'\\) onwards they occupy\nthe same space. Guillon (2021) notes that there are three varieties of\nthis colocationist view. First, one may maintain that they are\ndifferent despite sharing all parts: every proper part of Oscar is a\nproper part of Oscar\u2212 and vice versa. The\nsecond colocationist variety allows for two different material objects\nto be sums of the same set of material objects\u2014so Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 may be different although they are ultimately\ncomposed of the same particles. Finally, one of them, most probably\nOscar\u2212, may be considered a proper part of the other.\nObviously, these three options are meaningful only if one does\nnot assume the full strength of\n general existentional mereology.\n The last global option is to claim that Oscar and\nOscar\u2212 are two distinct temporally extended\nobjects\u2014a dog part, Oscar\u2212, and a dog, Oscar,\nwhich overlaps at \\(t'\\). Temporal parts of distinct objects can\noccupy the same space at the same time.\n\nThe solutions in the second group, temporalized solutions,\nrecognize the world\u2019s ontological inventory has changed at\n\\(t'\\). For instance, Chrysippus, according to Philo of Alexandria,\nclaimed that \u201cit is necessary that Dion remains while Theon has\nperished\u201d (Long and Sedley 1987, p. 172), so Dion exists\nthroughout the whole period, but Theon dies at \\(t'\\). Accepting some\nkind of mereological essentialism (Chisholm 1973), one may hold an\nopposite view: since all parts are essential to Oscar, the amputation\nevent killed Oscar while Oscar\u2212 either was created by\nthe event or enjoyed existence throughout the whole period in question.\nThen you may maintain that the event at \\(t'\\) either (i) brought\nOscar\u2212 into existence or (ii) did not disrupt\nOscar\u2212\u2019s prior existence (i.e.,\nOscar\u2212 existed at all times from \\(t\\) to \\(t'\\)).\nFinally, a proponent of\n contingent identity\n may claim that at t Oscar is different from\nOscar\u2212, but at \\(t'\\) they become identical. \n",
