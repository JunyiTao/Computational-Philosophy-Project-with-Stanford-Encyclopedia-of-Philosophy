    "main_text": "Overview: Wittgenstein\u2019s Argument and its Interpretations || Recent Developments and Their Consequences\n1.1 Recent Developments and Their Consequences\n\nInterpretation of Wittgenstein started to become even more complex at\nthe close of the twentieth century, as commentators began to focus on\nbroad questions of method. In both Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus and Philosophical\nInvestigations there is a tension between some statements that\nseem to be stating controversial philosophical positions and others\nthat seem to be saying that philosophy ought not to offer\ncontroversial theses but only work with what we already know by being\ncompetent language users embedded in human circumstances. In the\nlatter book there are passages that seem to support an\nanti-philosophical position and others that seem to offer interesting\nnew philosophical views in the process of criticizing more traditional\nphilosophical doctrines such as foundationalism and Cartesianism.\nAlong these lines, two overlapping distinctions concerning how to read\nPhilosophical Investigations have arisen: the\nresolute\u2013substantial distinction, and the\nPyrrhonian\u2013non-Pyrrhonian distinction. In general, the resolute\nand Pyrrhonian readings make Wittgenstein out to be an\nanti-philosopher, one who is not offering positive philosophical\ntheses to replace false ones; rather, his goal is to show the\nnonsensical nature of traditional philosophical theorizing. It is this\ngoal that is partly responsible for the unique style of\nPhilosophical Investigations (its dialogical and, at\nleast at times, anti-dogmatic, therapeutic character). On the\nsubstantial and non-Pyrrhonian readings, Wittgenstein is not only\npresenting a method for exposing the errors of traditional\nphilosophers, but also showing how philosophy should rightly be done\nand thereby offering positive philosophical views, views which must\noften be inferred or reconstructed from an elusive text. \n\nThere is neither a single resolute/Pyrrhonian nor a single\nsubstantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading of Wittgenstein. Moreover, there is\nan important difference between the resolute\u2013substantial and\nPyrrhonian\u2013non-Pyrrhonian distinctions. The former distinction\narises from a continuing debate on how to read Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus, both on its own and in relation to\nPhilosophical Investigations (see, e.g., Conant 2004 and\nMulhall 2007), and is associated with the so-called New\nWittgensteinians (see, e.g., Crary and Read 2000). The Pyrrhonian and\nnon-Pyrrhonian discussion is to be found, for example, in Fogelin\n(1994), Sluga (2004), and Stern (2004, 2007), and concerns the ways in\nwhich Wittgenstein might be considered as writing in the tradition of\nthe ancient Pyrrhonian sceptics, who were philosophically sceptical\nabout the very possibility of philosophy (see Fogelin 1994, pp. 3ff\nand 205ff). These distinctions cut across the distinction between\nOrthodox and Kripkean non-orthodox readings of the text: both Orthodox\nand Kripkean non-orthodox interpreters have tended to offer\nsubstantial or non-Pyrrhonian readings of Wittgenstein\u2014though\nthe line may not always be clear and some (e.g., Hacker, 1990) move\nfrom a resolute/Pyrrhonian to a substantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading\nwithout remarking the fact.\n\nSome (Fogelin, Stern, and Mulhall, for example) have come to question\nwhether it makes sense to suppose that either one or the other,\nresolute/Pyrrhonian or substantial/non-Pyrrhonian, must be\nthe correct way to read Wittgenstein. Fogelin and Stern see\nthe tension in the text of Philosophical Investigations\nas the expression of a tension, indeed a struggle, within its\nauthor, between his wanting to uncover the \u2018disguised\nnonsense\u2019 of philosophical theses and his being tempted and\ndrawn into still other philosophical positions on the nature of\nlanguage, reference, private experience, and philosophy itself. In\nwhat is surely a reference to \u00a7133c\u2014which reads: \u2018The\nreal discovery is the one that enables me to break off philosophizing\nwhen I want to. \u2014 The one that gives philosophy peace, so that\nit is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself in\nquestion\u2019\u2014Wittgenstein is reported by Rush Rhees to have\nsaid \u2018In my book I say that I am able to leave off with a\nproblem in philosophy when I want to. But that\u2019s a lie; I can\u2019t\u2019\n(Rhees, 1984, p. 219 n. 7). According to Stern, the Wittgenstein of\nthe Philosophical Investigations is more Pyrrhonian than\nnot, while understanding all too acutely the attraction of philosophy\nand the difficulty of giving it up. One\u2019s stance on these matters\naffects how one reads the private language sections, in particular by\nraising the question whether Wittgenstein intends to argue that the\npositive claim of the possibility of a private language is false, or\nis some kind of nonsense. \n",
