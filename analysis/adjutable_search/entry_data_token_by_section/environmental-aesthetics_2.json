Indeed, it is still an important component of\nthe kind of aesthetic experience commonly associated with ordinary\ntourism\u2014that which involves seeing and appreciating the natural\nworld as it is represented in the depictions found in travel\nbrochures, calendar photos, and picture postcards. However, while the\nidea of the picturesque continued to guide popular aesthetic\nappreciation of nature, the philosophical study of the aesthetics of\nnature, after flowering in the eighteenth century, went into decline.\nMany of the main themes, such as the concept of the sublime, the\nnotion of disinterestedness, and the theoretical centrality of nature\nin philosophical aesthetics, culminated with Kant, who gave some of\nthese ideas such exhaustive treatment that a kind of philosophical\nclosure was seemingly achieved. Following Kant, a new world order was\ninitiated by Hegel. In Hegel\u2019s philosophy, art was the highest\nexpression of \u201cAbsolute Spirit\u201d, and it, rather than\nnature, was destined to become the favored subject of philosophical\naesthetics. Thus, in the nineteenth century, both on the continent and\nin the United Kingdom, relatively few philosophers and only a\nscattering of thinkers of the Romantic Movement seriously pursued the\ntheoretical study of the aesthetics of nature. There was no\nphilosophical work comparable to that of the preceding century.\n\nHowever, while the philosophical study of the aesthetics of nature\nlanguished in Europe, a new way of understanding the aesthetic\nappreciation of the natural world was developing in North America.\nThis conception of nature appreciation had roots in the American\ntradition of nature writing, as exemplified in the essays of Henry\nDavid Thoreau. It was also inspired by the idea of the picturesque\nand, to a lesser extent, that of the sublime, especially in its\nartistic manifestations, such as the paintings of Thomas Cole and\nFrederic Church. However, as nature writing became its more dominant\nform of expression, the conception was increasingly shaped by\ndevelopments in the natural sciences. In the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury, it was influenced by the geographical work of George Perkins\nMarsh (Marsh 1865), who argued that humanity was increasingly causing\nthe destruction of the beauty of nature. The idea was forcefully\npresented toward the end of the century in the work of American\nnaturalist John Muir, who was steeped in natural history. Muir\nexplicitly distinguished this kind of understanding of the aesthetic\nappreciation of nature from that governed by the idea of the\npicturesque. In a well-known essay, \u201cA Near View of the High\nSierra\u201d (Muir 1894), two of Muir\u2019s artist companions, who\nfocus on mountain scenery, exemplify aesthetic experience of nature as\nguided by the idea of the picturesque. This differs from Muir\u2019s\nown aesthetic experience, which involved an interest in and\nappreciation of the mountain environment somewhat more akin to that of\na geologist. This way of experiencing nature eventually brought Muir\nto see the whole of the natural environment and especially wild nature\nas aesthetically beautiful and to find ugliness primarily where nature\nwas subject to human intrusion. The range of things that he regarded\nas aesthetically appreciable seemed to encompass the entire natural\nworld, from creatures considered hideous in his day, such as snakes\nand alligators, to natural disasters thought to ruin the environment,\nsuch as floods and earthquakes. The kind of nature appreciation\npracticed by Muir has become associated with the contemporary point of\nview called \u201cpositive aesthetics\u201d (Carlson 1984). Insofar\nas such appreciation eschews humanity\u2019s marks on the natural\nenvironment, it is somewhat the converse of aesthetic appreciation\ninfluenced by the idea of the picturesque, which finds interest and\ndelight in evidence of human presence.\n",
