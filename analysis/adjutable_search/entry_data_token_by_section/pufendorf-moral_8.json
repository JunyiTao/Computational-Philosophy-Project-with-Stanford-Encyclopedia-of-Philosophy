    "main_text": "Moral Philosophy || Speech, Property, and Commerce\n3.6 Speech, Property, and Commerce\n\nSince humans\u2019 emergence from the pre-cultural and pre-civil\nstates of nature is neither strictly concomitant or parallel, nor\nsequential, the development of DJN after Book III cannot be strictly\ncontinuous in either a topical or historical sense. Rather, it falls\ninto two partially overlapping sectors. Books IV\u2013V deal with\nhuman efforts to leave the natural state of need\n(indigentia), while Books VI\u2013VIII address the problem\nof security created by weakness (imbecillitas). Both require\nthe creation of new, complex, and formally organized kinds of human\ncooperation that address both the growing diversity and inconsistency\nof human desires, and the increase in human numbers.\n\nFundamental to both developments, however, is the institution of human\nspeech and the rules that make it effective, or possible (DJN IV.1;\nHochstrasser 2000). For without speech in the sense of symbolic\ncommunication human sociality would remain at a primitive and\nunsustainable level, in that the terms of human cooperation could not\nbe articulated and agreed upon. Conversely \u2013 and hinting at the\ngeneral providentialism that Pufendorf substitutes for traditional\nmetaphysical teleology \u2013 speech, or the communication of thought\nto others via sound, would be \u201cof hardly any use\u201d without\na social life (DJN IV.1.1). Unlike natural signs or associations\n(e.g., dawn, smoke, groans), speech is an artificial construct of\nhumans over time: learned rather than congenital, and arbitrary or\naccidental instead of naturally uniform, it is a clear instance of the\nwillful imposition of moral entities upon the world so as to give rise\nto new obligations. (DJN IV.1.4\u20135) Its utility depends upon\nconsent (tacit or express) and on the concomitant requirements of\nconsistency and veracity, which are both instrumentally and \u2013\ninsofar as humans are obligated to be social \u2013 morally\nnecessary. However, though humans are bound by the general conventions\nof language and by the requirement of not lying to one another, they\nretain a certain flexibility of action based on others\u2019 varying\nright to know one\u2019s thoughts, and the actual consequences of\nsuch revelations. Thus Pufendorf distinguishes between lies\n(mendacia) and untruths (falsiloquia) and also\nallows for noninjurious deceptions (DJN IV.1.9). This proviso applies\nnot only to everyday life and its \u201charmless arts of simulation\nand dissimulation,\u201d but also to the realm of politics and\ninternational relations, where total candor or naivete may be\ncounterproductive and defeat the injunctions of sociality (DJN\nIV.1.17; Martin 2009). Pufendorf returns to it repeatedly in\ndiscussing the duties of (esp. contemporary) historians (Seidler 1997,\nPiirim\u00e4e 2008). \n\nIt is clear in this as well as other discussions how Pufendorf\u2019s\nanthropological and social realism allows or actually requires a\ncertain flexibility in articulating context-specific obligations of\nthe natural law, even or especially within the particular human\ninstitutions created to enact sociality. It is because of this\nflexibility and consequent slipperiness of language that he goes on to\ntreat of oaths (DJN IV.2) which, presuming \u201chuman diffidence,\ninfidelity, ignorance, and impotence\u201d (DJN IV.2.2), are a\nspecial means for assuring others (through associated divine or civil\nsanctions) of the reliability of our speech acts and the promises and\npacts that rest thereon. Of course, since oaths themselves involve\npresumptions and tacit conditions arising from the nature of\nparticular cases (DJN IV.2.14), they too may require further\nregulation. Thus, like other human institutions based on pacts, the\nrules of speech both antedate civil sovereignty but come eventually to\ndepend on it in certain ways as well.\n\nA fundamental use of speech is to regulate humans\u2019 use of\nexternal things by appeal to the right of appropriation or dominion.\nThe latter rests on things\u2019 necessity or utility for humans, and\ntheir presumed (and divinely intended) availability for man\u2019s\nuse because of these features (DJN IV.3.1\u20133). Property\ndesignates a moral quality imposed on things, and it has a moral\neffect on other humans rather than (or beside) a physical impact on\nthe things or animals owned (DJN IV.4.1). That is, it is a social\nrelationship among humans (thus, solitary Adam\u2019s relation to\nthings was not ownership per se, and could not be transmitted) based\non express or tacit agreements that may vary according to\ncircumstances, so long as the ends of human sociality are served (DJN\nIV.4.4). Before or without such agreements, worldly objects are in a\nstate of negative community, meaning that they belong to no one in\nparticular but lie open for anyone to use as needed (DJN\nIV.4.2\u20133, 4.13). \n\nWhile Pufendorf acknowledges a kind of primitive community within\nfamily units, under the aegis of the father, he distinguishes this\nfrom positive communion in the sense of common ownership (Buckle\n1991). Both this and private dominion, or property properly speaking,\narise gradually with the proliferation and dispersion of family units,\nas humans and their needs multiply (DJN IV.4.12). For under such\nconditions it becomes necessary to distinguish mine from thine through\ncertain exclusionary conventions, if quarrels are to be avoided.\nTypically (but optionally), humans agree to a right of first occupancy\nor direct use, limited by the proviso of actual utility and the\nability to defend what is occupied (DJN IV.6.3) \u2013 though this\ndoes not suffice for ownership without consent. Some things like the\nopen ocean may (or can) not be owned, and so peaceful navigation\nthereon \u201cbelongs to everyone and is free.\u201d However, other\nkinds of exclusive restrictions, such as unequal trade relationships\namong nations, are permitted, and \u201cthat vaunted freedom of trade\ndoes not prevent a state from favoring its own citizens over\noutsiders\u201d (DJN IV.5.9\u201310). Also, since property is a\nmoral relationship rather than a physical quality, the same things may\nbe subject to different types of overlapping ownership (DJN IV.4.2).\nDominion need not be exclusive, and humans may grant others a perfect\nor imperfect right over their possessions. Indeed, they may be\nobligated to do so (DJN IV.8).\n\nSince owned objects serve different uses and are not equally valued by\neveryone, their exchange requires a common measure of comparison to\ndetermine their so-called moral quantity, or price (DJN\nV.1.1\u20132). Price is either ordinary or eminent, the latter\ndetermined by money as an independent, or objective, unit of value.\nMoney is explicitly created to serve the ends of exchange among both\nindividuals and states, and without it commercial pacts, or contracts,\nregarding both goods and services are inconceivable (DJN V.2.4). While\ncivil rulers have the authority to regulate property relationships in\ntheir realms (particularly specific forms of acquisition like hunting\nand fishing), and trade with outsiders, they are less free to\ndetermine the relative price of things since such arbitrariness would\ndisrupt economic exchange, especially interstate commerce (DJN IV.6.5;\nV.1.14). In general, sovereign determinations are less apt or useful\nin pre- or non-civil institutions that relieve human need, than in\nregard to those that insure human security \u2013 if these can be\ndistinguished. Nonetheless, economic tools like contracts may need a\ncivil sanction to insure their reliability and thus efficacy, and\nrulers may regulate property insofar as it affects the state\u2019s\nbasic security interests and welfare \u2013 not only by taxation and\neminent domain but also through controls on foreign trade and on the\ngrowth of luxury (e.g., sumptuary laws), whereby the state\u2019s\neconomic strength and independence are affected (DJN VII.4.7, VIII.5;\nSaeter 1996, Gaertner 2005, Young 2008, Skinner 1995, Seidler 2018).\n",
