    "main_text": "Objectivity as Absence of Normative Commitments and the Value-Free Ideal || Epistemic and Contextual Values\n3.1 Epistemic and Contextual Values\n\nBefore addressing what we will call the \u201cvalue-free\nideal\u201d, it will be helpful to distinguish four stages at which\nvalues may affect science. They are: (i) the choice of a scientific\nresearch problem; (ii) the gathering of evidence in relation to the\nproblem; (iii) the acceptance of a scientific hypothesis or theory as\nan adequate answer to the problem on the basis of the evidence; (iv)\nthe proliferation and application of scientific research results\n(Weber 1917 [1949]).\n\nMost philosophers of science would agree that the role of values in\nscience is contentious only with respect to dimensions (ii) and (iii):\nthe gathering of evidence and the acceptance\nof scientific theories. It is almost universally accepted\nthat the choice of a research problem is often influenced by interests\nof individual scientists, funding parties, and society as a whole.\nThis influence may make science more shallow and slow down its\nlong-run progress, but it has benefits, too: scientists will focus on\nproviding solutions to those intellectual problems that are considered\nurgent by society and they may actually improve people\u2019s lives.\nSimilarly, the proliferation and application of scientific research\nresults is evidently affected by the personal values of journal\neditors and end users, and little can be done about this. The real\ndebate is about whether or not the \u201ccore\u201d of scientific\nreasoning\u2014the gathering of evidence and the assessment and\nacceptance scientific theories\u2014is, and should be,\nvalue-free.\n\nWe have introduced the problem of the underdetermination of theory by\nevidence above. The problem does not stop, however, at values being\nrequired for filling the gap between theory and evidence. A further\ncomplication is that these values can conflict with each other.\nConsider the classical problem of fitting a mathematical function to a\ndata set. The researcher often has the choice between using a complex\nfunction, which makes the relationship between the variables less\nsimple but fits the data more accurately, or\npostulating a simpler relationship that is less\naccurate. Simplicity and accuracy are both important\ncognitive values, and trading them off requires a careful value\njudgment. However, philosophers of science tend to regard\nvalue-ladenness in this sense as benign. Cognitive\nvalues (sometimes also called \u201cepistemic\u201d or\n\u201cconstitutive\u201d values) such as predictive accuracy, scope,\nunification, explanatory power, simplicity and coherence with other\naccepted theories are taken to be indicative of the truth of a theory\nand therefore provide reasons for preferring one theory over another\n(McMullin 1982, 2009; Laudan 1984; Steel 2010). Kuhn (1977) even\nclaims that cognitive values define the shared commitments of science,\nthat is, the standards of theory assessment that characterize the\nscientific approach as a whole. Note that not every philosopher\nentertains the same list of cognitive values: subjective differences\nin ranking and applying cognitive values do not vanish, a point Kuhn\nmade emphatically.\n\nIn most views, the objectivity and authority of science is not\nthreatened by cognitive values, but only by\nnon-cognitive or contextual values.\nContextual values are moral, personal, social, political and cultural\nvalues such as pleasure, justice and equality, conservation of the\nnatural environment and diversity. The most notorious cases of\nimproper uses of such values involve travesties of scientific\nreasoning, where the intrusion of contextual values led to an\nintolerant and oppressive scientific agenda with devastating epistemic\nand social consequences. In the Third Reich, a large part of\ncontemporary physics, such as the theory of relativity, was condemned\nbecause its inventors were Jewish; in the Soviet Union, biologist\nNikolai Vavilov was sentenced to death (and died in prison) because\nhis theories of genetic inheritance did not match Marxist-Leninist\nideology. Both states tried to foster a science that was motivated by\npolitical convictions (\u201cDeutsche Physik\u201d in Nazi Germany,\nLysenko\u2019s Lamarckian theory of inheritance and denial of\ngenetics), leading to disastrous epistemic and institutional\neffects.\n\nLess spectacular, but arguably more frequent are cases where research\nis biased toward the interests of the sponsors, such as tobacco\ncompanies, food manufacturers and large pharmaceutic firms (e.g.,\nResnik 2007; Reiss 2010). This preference bias,\ndefined by Wilholt (2009) as the infringement of conventional\nstandards of the research community with the aim of arriving at a\nparticular result, is clearly epistemically harmful. Especially for\nsensitive high-stakes issues such as the admission of medical drugs or\nthe consequences of anthropogenic global warming, it seems desirable\nthat research scientists assess theories without being influenced by\nsuch considerations. This is the core idea of the\n\n\nValue-Free Ideal (VFI): Scientists should strive to\nminimize the influence of contextual values on scientific reasoning,\ne.g., in gathering evidence and assessing/accepting scientific\ntheories.\n\n\nAccording to the VFI, scientific objectivity is characterized by\nabsence of contextual values and by exclusive commitment to cognitive\nvalues in stages (ii) and (iii) of the scientific process. See Dorato\n(2004: 53\u201354), Ruphy (2006: 190) or Biddle (2013: 125) for\nalternative formulations.\n\nFor value-freedom to be a reasonable ideal, it must not be a goal\nbeyond reach and be attainable at least to some degree. This claim is\nexpressed by the\n\n\nValue-Neutrality Thesis (VNT): Scientists\ncan\u2014at least in principle\u2014gather evidence and\nassess/accept theories without making contextual value judgments.\n\n\nUnlike the VFI, the VNT is not normative: its subject is whether the\njudgments that scientists make are, or could possibly be, free of\ncontextual values. Similarly, Hugh Lacey (1999) distinguishes three\nprincipal components or aspects of value-free science: impartiality,\nneutrality and autonomy. Impartiality means that\ntheories are solely accepted or appraised in virtue of their\ncontribution to the cognitive values of science, such as truth,\naccuracy or explanatory power. This excludes the influence of\ncontextual values, as stated above. Neutrality means\nthat scientific theories make no value statements about the world:\nthey are concerned with what there is, not with what there should be.\nFinally, scientific autonomy means that the\nscientific agenda is shaped by the desire to increase scientific\nknowledge, and that contextual values have no place in scientific\nmethod.\n\nThese three interpretations of value-free science can be combined with\neach other, or used individually. All of them, however, are subject to\ncriticisms that we examine below. Denying the VNT, or the\nattainability of Lacey\u2019s three criteria for value-free science,\nposes a challenge for scientific objectivity: one can either conclude\nthat the ideal of objectivity should be rejected, or develop a\nconception of objectivity that differs from the VFI.\n",
