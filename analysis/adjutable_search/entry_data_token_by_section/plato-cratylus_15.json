Correctness and Imitation (421c\u2013427d)\n\nHaving discovered that many Greek names are built up from names like\nion, rhe\u00f4n, and doun, Socrates\nobserves that the process of etymological analysis must necessarily\nstop after finitely many steps. There must be \u201cfirst\nnames\u201d (prota onomata), then\u2014names that do not\nhave an etymological meaning in virtue of the fact that they are\ncomposed of other names (421c\u2013422c). Since ion,\nrhe\u00f4n, and doun seem to be among these\netymologically simple names, their correctness cannot\npossibly depend on their etymological meaning. Socrates thus finds\nhimself in a predicament: For his theory of the correctness of\netymologically complex names would be built on sand if it were\nimpossible to account for the natural correctness of etymologically\nsimple names (cf. 426a\u2013b). Hence, he decides to\n\u201cinvestigate in some other manner\u201d what the correctness of\nthese names \u201cconsists in\u201d (422b). The present section\nfocuses on this investigation.\n",
