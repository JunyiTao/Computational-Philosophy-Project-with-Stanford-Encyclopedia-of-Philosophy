    "main_text": "Vague identity\n9. Vague identity\n\nLike the impossibility of contingent identity, the impossibility of\nvague identity appears to be a straightforward consequence of the\nclassical concept of identity (Evans 1978, see also Salmon 1982). For\nif a is only vaguely identical with b, something is\ntrue of it \u2013 that it is only vaguely identical with b\n\u2013 that is not true of b, so, by Leibniz\u2019s Law, it\nis not identical with b at all. Of course, there are vague\nstatements of identity \u2013 \u201cPrinceton is Princeton\nBorough\u201d (Lewis 1988) \u2013 but the conclusion appears to\nfollow that such vagueness is only possible when one or both of the\nterms flanking the sign of identity is an imprecise designator.\nRelatedly, it appears to follow that identity itself must be a\ndeterminate relation.\n\nBut some examples suggest that this conclusion is too sweeping \u2013\nthat even identity statements containing precise designators may be,\nin some sense, indeterminate. Consider Everest and some precisely\ndefined hunk of rock, ice and snow, Rock, of which it is indeterminate\nwhether its boundaries coincide with those of Everest. It is tempting\nto think that \u201cEverest\u201d and \u201cRock\u201d are both\nprecise designators (if \u201cEverest\u201d is not, is anything?\n(Tye 2000)) and that \u201cEverest is Rock\u201d is nonetheless in\nsome sense indeterminate.\n\nThose who take this view have to respond to Evans\u2019s original\nargument, about which there has been intense debate (see separate\narticle on vagueness, Edgington 2000, Lewis 1988, Parsons 2000, van\nInwagen 1990, Williamson 2002 and 2003), but also to more recent\nvariants. There is no space to go into these matters here, but one\nparticular variant of the Evans argument worth briefly noting is given\nby Hawley (2001). Alpha and Omega are (two?) people, the first of whom\nsteps into van Inwagen\u2019s (1990) fiendish cabinet which disrupts\nwhatever features are relevant to personal identity, and the second of\nwhom then steps out:\n\n(1) It is indeterminate whether Alpha steps out of the cabinet\n\n\n(2) Alpha is such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out of\nthe cabinet\n\n(3) It is not indeterminate whether Omega steps out of the cabinet\n\n(4) Omega is not such that it is indeterminate whether she steps out\nof the cabinet\n\n(5) Alpha is not identical to Omega.\n\n\nThis argument differs from the standard version of Evans\u2019s\nargument by not depending upon identity-involving properties (e.g.\nbeing such that it is indeterminate whether she is Omega) to establish\ndistinctness, and this removes some sources of controversy. Others, of\ncourse, remain.\n\nThe debate over vague identity is too vast to survey here, but to\nfinish this section we can relate this debate to the previously\ndiscussed debate about identity over time.\n\nFor some putative cases of vagueness in synchronic identity it seems\nreasonable to accept the conclusion of Evans\u2019s argument and\nlocate the indeterminacy in language (see the \u201cReply\u201d by\nShoemaker in Shoemaker and Swinburne 1984 for the following example).\nA structure consists of two halls, Alpha Hall and Beta Hall, linked by\na flimsy walkway, Smith is located in Alpha Hall, Jones in Beta Hall.\nThe nature of the structure is such that the identity statement\n\u201cThe building in which Smith is located is the building in which\nJones is located\u201d is neither true nor false because it is\nindeterminate whether Alpha Hall and Beta Hall count as two distinct\nbuildings or merely as two parts of one and the same building. Here it\nis absolutely clear what is going on. The term \u201cbuilding\u201d\nis vague in a way that makes it indeterminate whether it applies to\nthe whole structure or just to the two halls. Consequently, it is\nindeterminate what \u201cthe building in which Smith is\nlocated\u201d and \u201cthe building in which Jones is\nlocated\u201d denote.\n\nPerdurance theorists, who assimilate identity over time to identity\nover space, can accommodate vagueness in identity over time in the\nsame way. In Hawley\u2019s example they can say that there are\nseveral entities present: one that exists before and after the\nidentity-obscuring occurrences in the cabinet, one that exists only\nbefore, and one that exists only after. It is indeterminate which of\nthese is a person and so it is indeterminate what the singular terms\n\u201cAlpha\u201d and \u201cOmega\u201d refer to.\n\nThis involves taking on an ontology that is larger than we ordinarily\nrecognise, but that is not uncongenial to the perdurance theorist, who\nis happy to regard any, however spatiotemporally disconnected, region\nas containing a physical object (Quine 1960:171).\n\nBut what of endurance theorists?\n\nOne option for them is to adopt the same response and to accept a\nmultiplicity of entities partially coinciding in space and time where\nto common sense there seems to be only one. But this is to give up on\none of the major advantages claimed by the endurance theorist, his\nconsonance with common sense.\n\nThe endurance theorist has several other options. He may simply deny\nthe existence of the relevant entities and restrict his ontology to\nentities which are not complex; he may insist that any change destroys\nidentity so that in a strict and philosophical sense Alpha is distinct\nfrom Omega; or he may reject the case as one of vagueness, insisting\nthat, though we do not know the answer, either Alpha is Omega or she\nis not.\n\nHowever, the most tempting option for the endurance theorist, which\nkeeps closest to common sense, is to accept that the case is one of\nvagueness, deny the multiplicity of entities embraced by the\nperdurance theorist and reject Evans\u2019s argument against vague\nidentity.\n\nThat this is so highlights the fact that there is no easy solution to\nthe problem consonant in every respect with common sense. Locating the\nvagueness in language requires us to acknowledge a multiplicity of\nentities of which we would apparently otherwise have to take no\nnotice. Whilst locating it in the world requires an explanation of\nhow, contrary to Evans\u2019s argument, the impossibility of vague\nidentity is not a straightforward consequence of the classical\nconception of identity, or else the abandonment of that\nconception.\n",
