Many of these are defined in terms\nof specific laboratory tasks and are unlikely to qualify as\nnatural kinds (Tulving 2007), kinds that carve\nnature\u2014in this case, the\nmind\u2014at its joints. But even if only the\nkinds acknowledged by the standard taxonomy are considered,\nit is not obvious whether any particular kind of memory, never mind\nmemory as a whole, is a natural kind.\n\nThe obvious starting point here is the view that memory is indeed a\nnatural kind. Michaelian (2011b) has, however, suggested that memory\nis not a natural kind, arguing that, because only declarative memory\ninvolves the encoding, storage, and retrieval of content, declarative\nand nondeclarative memory are sharply distinct from each other. This\nis consistent with the view that declarative memory is a natural kind,\nbut Klein (2015) has rejected even the latter view, claiming that,\nbecause episodic memory necessarily involves a particular\nphenomenology, episodic memory and semantic memory are sharply\ndistinct. In response, Michaelian (2015) has appealed to cases in\nwhich subjects appear to have intact episodic memory despite having\nimpaired episodic phenomenology (Klein & Nichols 2012)\nto argue that the phenomenology in question is not, strictly speaking, a\nnecessary feature of episodic memory. If this suggestion is right,\nthen declarative memory may after all be natural kind. But even if\ndeclarative memory turns out not to be a natural kind, episodic memory\nmight still be a natural kind. Cheng and Werning (2016), for example,\nhave argued on the basis of their \u201csequence\nanalysis\u201d of remembering\u2014a\nvariant of the causal theory of memory introduced in section 4\n below\u2014that episodic memory is indeed a natural kind.\n\nWhile there is some work on the question of the natural kindhood of\nepisodic memory, the question of the natural kindhood of kinds of\nmemory other than episodic memory remains almost entirely unexplored.\nFuture work here might both draw on and contribute to resolving the\ndebate between systems and process views of memory (Bechtel 2001;\nFoster & Jelicic 1999; Schacter &\nTulving 1994). According to systems views, memory consists of multiple\nindependent systems which interact in various ways. According to process\nviews, in contrast, memory is a unitary capacity which is employed in\ndifferent ways in response to different demands. The once-lively debate\nbetween partisans of systems views and partisans of process views has now\nlargely died down. It has not, however, been clearly resolved in\nfavour of either camp, and progress towards resolving it might be made\nby bringing the available evidence into contact with detailed theories\nof natural kinds.\n",
