    "main_text": "\n\nLucrezia Marinella was a Venetian author of the sixteenth century, who\npublished prolifically in a range of genres, primarily devotional\nliterature (in prose and verse) and philosophical polemics. Her work,\nLa nobilt\u00e0 et l\u2019eccellenza delle donne, co\u2019\ndifetti et mancamenti de gli uomini, (The Nobility and\nExcellence of Women and the Defects and Vices of Men), published\nin 1600, was one of the first polemical treatises written by a woman\nin Italian as part of an ongoing debate about the nature and worth of\nwomen, often called the querelle des femmes (the debate about\n women).[1]\nThe Nobility and Excellence of Women is an erudite\nrecapitulation of the arguments and evidence brought forward to\nsupport claims for the merits of women, but it is more than a summary.\nMarinella provides a cogent, extended argument for the superiority of\nwomen\u2019s intellectual and moral capacities, effectively\nconstructing an account of a nature proper to women and distinct from\nthe nature of man.\n\nThe Nobility and Excellence of Women is remarkable in several\nrespects, aside from its philosophical and rhetorical skill. First,\nalthough several of Marinella\u2019s predecessors on the pro-woman\nside of the debate had argued both that men and women were equal in so\nfar as they shared a rational soul, and also that women were superior,\nthey had failed to address adequately the tension between the claims\nof equality and of superiority; Marinella addresses it directly and\npersuasively. Her argument takes the bodies of women as a starting\npoint, from which she adduces evidence to demonstrate that\nwomen\u2019s moral characters are better than those of men, and that\nthe moral superiority of women leads to an intellectual superiority.\nSecond, Marinella advances the case being made by women and their\nsupporters beyond a demand for sympathy and respect from men to a\ndemand for freedom, power, and equality (Cox 1995, 520). Although she\ndid not propose concrete reforms, she did analyze the situation of\nwomen in explicitly political terms. Third, although many had decried\nthe viciousness of those who argued for the inferiority of women,\nMarinella was one of the first to supply an explanation of the motives\nof men who published misogynist works, and to connect those motives to\nthe exclusion of women from public life (Jordan 1990, 259; Cox 1995,\n516).\n",
