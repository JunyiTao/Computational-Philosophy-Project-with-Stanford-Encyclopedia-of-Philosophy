    "main_text": "Mental imagery in cognition || Mental imagery and language\n3.3 Mental imagery and language\n\nThroughout the history of philosophy imagistic mental representations\nhave been routinely contrasted with abstract, linguistic\nrepresentations (see Yolton 1996 for a summary). So the assumption\nhere is that there is a sharp contrast between two different kinds of\nmental representations: imagistic ones, like mental imagery and\nabstract, linguistic ones. And when we talk about the importance of\nmental imagery in human cognition, the reach of mental imagery is\nlimited as there is an extra layer of mental representations,\nabstract, linguistic ones, which have nothing to do with mental\nimagery. This, in fact, may be one of the reasons why the obsessive\nemphasis on language at the middle of the 20th century\nsidelined the philosophical study of mental imagery. Either way, the\noverall picture then is that there is imagistic cognition and there is\nlinguistic cognition and the two have nothing to do with each other.\nThere have been important debates about where to draw the line between\nthese two domains of the mind: almost all imagistic cognition (a\nbroadly Humean picture) vs almost all linguistic cognition (a broadly\nWittgensteinian picture).\n\nEmpirical findings work against a common presupposition in this\ndebate. We now know that language processing is not completely\ndetachable from imagistic cognition. One important set of findings\ncome from the \u2018dual coding theory\u2019 (Paivio 1971, 1986),\naccording to which linguistic representations themselves are partly\nconstituted (or at least necessarily accompanied) by mental imagery\nand this explains why concrete words (that are accompanied by more\ndeterminate mental imagery) are easier to recall than abstract words\n(that are accompanied by less determinate and in some cases very\nindeterminate mental imagery).\n\nWhile Paivio\u2019s dual coding theory posited the importance of\nmental imagery in linguistic processing to explain the behavioral\ndifferences between the recall of concrete and abstract words, we also\nknow a lot about the ways in which linguistic labels change (and speed\nup) perceptual processes as well as a fair amount about the time scale\nof this influence. The crucial piece of finding both from EEG and from\neye tracking studies is that linguistic labels influence shape\nrecognition in less than 100 milliseconds (Boutonnet and Lupyan 2015,\nde Groot et al. 2016, Noorman et al. 2018). This means that linguistic\nand imagistic representations interact at an extremely early stage of\nperceptual processing \u2013 by any account in early cortical\nprocessing (see Thorpe et al. 1996 and Lamme and Roelfsema 2000 for\nthe temporal unfolding of visual processing in unimodal cases). All\nthis indicates that imagistic and linguistic cognition are far from\nbeing independent from one another \u2013 they are deeply intertwined\neven at the earliest levels of perceptual processing.\n",
