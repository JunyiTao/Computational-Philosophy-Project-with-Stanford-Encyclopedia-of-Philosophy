    "main_text": "Metaphysics: Leibnizian Idealism || Monadic Hierarchies\n5.4 Monadic Hierarchies\n\n\nIf the only things that truly exist are mind-like entities, monads,\nthen the differences between them must be explicable in terms of mental\nfeatures. Now, it was stated above that a central feature of\nLeibniz's account of substance was his claim that substances are\nendowed with active and passive forces. In his mature metaphysics,\nLeibniz expresses this view somewhat differently by saying that a\nsubstance is active insofar as it has distinct perceptions and passive\ninsofar as it has confused perceptions. Thus, for example, in \u00a749\nof the Monadology, Leibniz writes that, \u201cwe attribute\naction to a monad insofar as it has distinct perceptions, and\npassion, insofar as it has confused perceptions\u201d (G VI\n615/AG 219). But, as we learn later in the same work, \u201cMonads all\ngo confusedly to infinity, to the whole; but they are limited and\ndifferentiated by the degrees of their distinct perceptions\u201d (G\nVI 617/AG 221). The fundamental idea here is two-fold: first, activity\nand passivity are features of the relative clarity and distinctness of\nthe representations of the monad, and, second, insofar as the organic\nbodies of a particular monad are themselves constituted by monads, they\n\u2013 the monads of the organic body \u2013 will have confused\nperceptions. This chain goes down to the infinitely small, with monads\nhaving only very confused and inexact perceptions of the world.\n\n\nSince there is a hierarchy among monads within any animal, from the\nsoul of a person down to the infinitely small monad, the relation of\ndomination and subordination among monads is a crucial feature of both\nLeibniz's idealism and his panorganicism. But the hierarchy of\nsubstances is not simply one of containment, in which one monad has an\norganic body which is the result of other monads, each of which has an\norganic body, and so on. In the case of animals (brutes and human\nbeings), the hierarchy of monads is also related to the\ncontrol of the \u201cmachine of nature\u201d (as Leibniz had\nput it in a letter to De Volder considered above). What is it then that\nexplains the relation of dominant and subordinate monads? As Leibniz\ntells Des Bosses, domination and subordination consists of degrees of\nperfection. Since monads are to be differentiated in terms of their\nperceptions, one natural reading would simply be that suggested in the\nparagraph above: monad x is dominant over\nmonad y when x has\nclearer perceptions than y. But, if we follow\nthe description of the appearance of causal interaction that we find in\nthe Monadology (\u00a7\u00a749\u201351), we can get a slightly more\nsophisticated picture. Monad x is dominant\nover monad y when x\ncontains within it reasons for the actions of\ny. This is why the mind of an animal can be\nsaid to direct the actions of its body, and why, for example, there\nwill be a hierarchy of functionality within any one animal. Thus,\none's mind has clearer perceptions than those contained in the\nmonads of its organic body, but it contains the reasons for everything\nthat happens in one's body; one's liver contains the\nreasons for what happens in its cells; a cell contains the reasons for\nwhat happens in its mitochondria; and, according to Leibniz, this\nrelation continues infinitely on down.\n",
