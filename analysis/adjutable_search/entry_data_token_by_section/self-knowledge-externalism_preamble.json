    "main_text": "\n\nExternalism in the philosophy of mind contends that the meaning or\ncontent of a\n thought[1]\n is partly determined by the environment. The view has garnered\nattention since it denies the traditional assumption, associated with\nDescartes, that thought content is fixed independently of the external\nworld. Apparently under this assumption, Descartes also believed that\nhe could know the content of his thoughts while suspending all\njudgment about his environs. (Indeed, such knowledge was thought\nindubitable.) Yet if externalism is correct, this may well be a\nmistake. As we shall see, externalism can suggest that Descartes is\nunable to know that his own thought represents, say, elm trees (vs.\nbeech trees) without knowing that it is elms (and not\nbeeches) that the thought is connected to in the world. But if such\nworldly knowledge is a prerequisite, then Descartes could not know the\ncontent of this thought just \u201cfrom the armchair,\u201d so to\nspeak. So there seems to be a conflict between externalism and such\narmchair knowledge of one\u2019s own thought contents (for short:\n\u201carmchair self-knowledge\u201d). The question whether this\nconflict is real is what drives the contemporary debate on externalism\nand self-knowledge.\n\nOfficially, we can put the issue in terms of an apparent tension\nbetween the following:\n\n\n\n(EXT)\nThought content is determined partly by the\n environment.[2]\n\n\n(SK)\nA subject can know from the armchair what content her thoughts\n have.[3]\n\n\n\n\nThe issue is that EXT seemingly implies that knowing about content\nrequires knowing about the environment. And since the latter is\nempirical, so too would be the former, contra\n SK.[4]\n Now it is usually thought that, if EXT is incompatible with SK, this\nwould be a serious problem for EXT (though some think internalism also\nconflicts with SK; see McLaughlin & Tye 1998a, Farkas 2003, Bar-On\n2006, p. 434). Yet some think the incompatibility threatens SK instead\nof EXT (see section\n 2.4).\n Regardless, the interest in the debate goes beyond EXT, for it\npertains to many central concerns of philosophers, such as the nature\nof knowledge and the relation between mind and world. The debate also\ntouches on more specialized topics, including memory, concept\nacquisition, epistemic responsibility, and transcendental\narguments.\n\nIn the standard terminology, the dispute is between\nincompatibilists who affirm the conflict between EXT and SK,\nand compatibilists who deny it. Incompatibilists have pressed\nthe conflict mainly in two ways. The first way, discussed in section\n2, is by a reductio ad absurdum: Incompatibilists argue that EXT plus\nSK entail the absurdity that one can know just from the armchair\ncontingent facts about the external world. The second way, discussed\nin section 3, features a thought experiment about \u201cslow\nswitching\u201d between two environments. Incompatibilists argue that\nsuch thought experiments show that EXT precludes SK. In section 4, we\nwill end with some lesser-known issues for externalist\nself-knowledge.\n",
