    "main_text": "Agent-Causal Theories\n3. Agent-Causal Theories\n\nA number of incompatibilists have maintained that a free decision (or\nsome event internal to such a decision) must be caused by the agent,\nand it must not be the case that either what the agent causes or the\nagent\u2019s causing that event is causally determined by prior\nevents. On what are called agent-causal views, causation by an agent\nis held not to consist in causation by events (such as the\nagent\u2019s recognizing certain reasons). An agent, it is said, is a\npersisting substance; causation by an agent is causation by such a\nsubstance. Since a substance is not the kind of thing that can itself\nbe an effect (though various events involving it can be), on these\naccounts an agent is in a strict and literal sense an originator of\nher free decisions, an uncaused cause of them. This combination of\nindeterminism and origination is thought to capture best the idea\nthat, when we act freely, a plurality of alternatives is open to us\nand we determine, ourselves, which of these we pursue, and to secure\nthe kind of freedom needed for moral responsibility.\n\nGeorge Berkeley (1710 [1998]) and Thomas Reid (1788 [1969]) held views\nof this type in the early modern period. In recent years, agent-causal\naccounts have been advanced by Roderick Chisholm (1966, 1971, 1976a,\n1976b, and 1978), Randolph Clarke (1993 and 1996), Alan Donagan\n(1987), Meghan Griffith (2005, 2007, and 2010), Jonathan Jacobs and\nTimothy O\u2019Connor (2013), T. J. Mawson (2011), Timothy\nO\u2019Connor (1995, 1996, 2000a, 2000b, 2002, 2005, 2009a and\n2009b), William Rowe (1991, 2000, 2003, and 2006), Helen Steward\n(2012), Richard Taylor (1966 and 1992), John Thorp (1980), and Michael\nZimmerman (1984). Derk Pereboom (2001, 2004, 2007, and 2014) has\nargued that we can have free will only if we are agent-causes, but\nthat the evidence is against the existence of agent causation.\n\nSetting aside (for the moment) the question of evidence, agent-causal\ntheories face three main objections. One concerns acting freely for a\nreason and the reason-explanation of free actions; the second is the\nproblem of luck; the last concerns the intelligibility of the notion\nof agent causation and whether causation by an agent (where this is\nunderstood to be causation by a substance) is possible.\n",
