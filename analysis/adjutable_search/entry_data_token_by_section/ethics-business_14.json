    "main_text": "Firms and workers || Compensation\n6.2 Compensation\n\nBusinesses generate revenue, and some of this revenue is distributed\nto employees in the form of compensation, or pay. Since the demand for\npay typically exceeds the supply, the question of how pay should be\ndistributed is naturally analyzed as a problem of justice.\n\nTwo theories of justice in pay have attracted attention. One may be\ncalled the \u201cagreement view\u201d. According to it, a just wage\nis whatever wage the employer and the employee agree to without force\nor fraud (Boatright 2010). This view is sometimes justified in terms\nof property rights. Employees own their labor, and employers own their\ncapital, and they are free, within broad limits, to dispose of it as\nthey please. In addition, we might think that wages should be should\ndetermined by voluntary agreement for the same reason prices generally\nshould be, viz., it allocates resources to their most productive uses,\nas determined by people\u2019s wants (Heath 2018; Hayek 1945). A\n\u201cwage\u201d, after all, is just a special name for the price of\nlabor.\n\nA second view of wages may be called the \u201ccontribution\nview\u201d. According to it, the just wage for a worker is the wage\nthat reflects her contribution to the firm. This view comes in two\nversions. On the absolute version, workers should receive an amount of\npay that equals the value of their contributions to the firm (D.\nMiller 1999). On the comparative version, workers should receive an\namount of pay that reflects the relative value of their contributions\nto the firm, given what others in the firm contribute and are paid\n(Sternberg 2000). The contribution view strikes some as normatively\nbasic, a view for which no further argument can be given (D. Miller\n1999). An analogy may be drawn with punishment. Just as it seems\nintuitively right for the severity of a criminal\u2019s punishment to\nreflect the seriousness of her crime, so it may seem intuitively right\nfor the value of a persons\u2019s pay to reflect the value of her\nwork (Moriarty 2016). In this way, pay might be understood as a reward\nfor work.\n\nSome argue that compensation should be evaluated not only as a problem\nof justice but as an incentive. The question here is what pay\nencourages employees to do, and how it encourages them to do it.\nPoorly structured compensation packages for traders in the financial\nservices industry are thought to have contributed to the financial\ncrisis of 2007-2009 (Kolb 2012). Traders were incentivized to take\nexcessively risky bets, and when those bets went bad, their firms\ncould not cover the losses, putting the firms and ultimately the whole\nfinancial system in peril. Bad incentives may also help to explain the\nrecent account fraud scandal at Wells Fargo.\n\nThe pay of any employee can be evaluated from a moral point of view.\nBut business ethicists have paid particular attention to the pay of\ncertain employees, viz., CEOs and workers in factories in developing\ncountries, often called \u201csweatshops.\u201d\n\nThere has been significant debate about whether CEOs are paid too much\n(Boatright, 2010; Moriarty 2005), with scholars falling into two\ncamps. Those in the \u201cmanagerial power\u201d camp believe that\nCEOs wield power over boards of directors, and use this power to\nextract above-market rents from their firms (Bebchuk & Fried\n2004). Those in the \u201cefficient contracting\u201d camp believe\nthat pay negotiations between CEOs and boards are usually carried out\nat arm\u2019s-length, and that CEOs\u2019 large compensation\npackages reflect their rare and valuable skills. (For a recent survey\nof relevant empirical issues, see Edmans, Gabaix, & Jenter\n2017).\n\nThere has also been a robust debate about whether workers in\nsweatshops are paid too little. Some say \u2018no\u2019 (Powell\n& Zwolinski 2012; Zwolinski 2007). They say that sweatshops wages,\nwhile low by standards in developed countries, are not low by the\nstandards of the countries in which the sweatshops are located. This\nexplains why people choose to work in a sweatshop; it is the best\noffer they have. Efforts to increase artificially the wages of\nsweatshop workers, according to these writers, is misguided on two\ncounts. First, it is an interference with the autonomous choices of\nemployers and workers. Second, it is likely to make workers worse off,\nsince employers will respond by either moving operations to a new\nlocation or employing fewer workers in that location (cf. Kates 2015).\nThese writers sometimes appeal to a principle of\n\u201cnonworseness,\u201d according to which a consensual, mutually\nbeneficial interaction (of the sort sweatshop owners and workers\nengage in) cannot be worse than its absence. Other writers challenge\nthese claims. While granting that workers choose to work in\nsweatshops, they deny that their choices are truly voluntary (Arnold\n& Bowie 2003; Kates 2015). Given their low wages, this suggests\nthat sweatshop workers are wrongfully exploited (Faraci 2019).\nMoreover, some argue, firms can and should do more for sweatshop\nworkers, on grounds on fairness or beneficence (Snyder 2010). These\nwriters invoke a principle of \u201cinteraction,\u201d according to\nwhich people involved in a certain relationship (of the sort sweatshop\nowners and workers are engaged in) must live up to certain standards\nof conduct (which exploitation is alleged to fall below). In response\nto the claim that firms put themselves at a competitive disadvantage\nif they do, writers have pointed to actual cases where firms have been\nable to secure better treatment for sweatshop workers without\nsuffering serious financial penalties (Hartman, Arnold, & Wokutch\n2003).
