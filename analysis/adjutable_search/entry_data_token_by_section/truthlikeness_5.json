    "main_text": "The Axiological Problem\n4. Conclusion\n\nWe are all fallibilists now, but we are not all skeptics, or\nantirealists or nihilists. Most of us think inquiries can and do\nprogress even when they fall short of their goal of locating the truth\nof the matter. We think that an inquiry can progress by moving from\none falsehood to another falsehood, or from one imperfect credal state\nto another. To reconcile epistemic optimism with realism in the teeth\nof the dismal induction we need a viable concept of truthlikeness, a\nviable account of the empirical indicators of truthlikeness, and a\nviable account of the role of truthlikeness in cognitive value. And\nall three accounts must fit together appropriately.\n\nThere are a number of approaches to the logical problem of\ntruthlikeness but, unfortunately, there is as yet little consensus on\nwhat constitutes the best or most promising approach, and prospects\nfor combining the best features of each approach do not at this stage\nseem bright. In fact, recent work on whether the three main approaches\nto the logical problem of truthlikeness presented above are compatible\nseems to point to a negative answer (see the supplement on\n The compatibility of the approaches).\n There is, however, much work to be done on both the epistemological\nand the axiological aspects of truthlikeness, and it may well be that\nnew constraints will emerge from those investigations that will help\nfacilitate a fully adequate solution to the logical problem as\nwell.\n",
