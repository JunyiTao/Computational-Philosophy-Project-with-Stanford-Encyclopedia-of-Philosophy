    "main_text": "Consciousness and Intentionality in Phenomenology\n3. Consciousness and Intentionality in Phenomenology\n\nA history of ideas about consciousness and intentionality could easily\ntake us further into the past than this article can cover. A\nconvenient, relatively recent starting point would be in the\nphilosophy of Franz Brentano. He more than any other single thinker is\nresponsible for keeping the term \u201cintentional\u201d alive in\nphilosophical discussions of the last century and a half or so, with\nsomething like its current use, and was much concerned with its\nrelationship to consciousness (Brentano [1874] 1973). Brentano himself\nwas quite aware of the deep historical background to his notion of\nintentionality: he looked back through scholastic discussions (crucial\nto the development of Descartes\u2019 immensely influential theory of\nideas), and ultimately to Aristotle for his theme of intentionality\n(Brentano [1867] 1977). One may well go further back, to Plato\u2019s\ndiscussion (in the Sophist, and the Theaetetus) of\ndifficulties in making sense of false belief, and yet further still,\nto the dawn of Western Philosophy, and Parmenides\u2019 attempt to\ndraw enormous consequences from allegedly finding that it is not\npossible to think or speak of what is not. In this section, we will\nreview how Brentano conceived of intentionality and consciousness, and\ntheir relationship, and how that conception was transformed in the\nthought of his student Husserl\u2014whose name is that most strongly\nassociated with the phenomenological movement\u2014and in the\nwritings of some of those he strongly influenced. This will allow us\nto introduce the three themes mentioned in the\nintroduction\u2014detachability, basic forms, and\nreflexivity\u2014by which one might unify the disparate discussions\nof consciousness and intentionality arising over roughly the last\ncentury.\n\nFor Brentano, initially at least, what seems crucial to intentionality\nis the mind\u2019s capacity to refer or be directed to objects that\nmay exist only in mind\u2014what he called \u201cmental or\nintentional inexistence\u201d. In a famous passage, he introduces the\nnotion this way.\n\n\nEvery mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of\nthe Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an\nobject, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously,\nreference [or relation] to a content, direction toward an object\n(which is not to be understood as a reality), or immanent objectivity.\nEvery mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself,\nalthough they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation\nsomething is presented, in judgment something is affirmed or denied,\nin love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. (Brentano\n[1874] 1973: 88)\n\n\nIt is not straightforward just what Brentano meant by saying mental\nphenomena include objects within themselves, or that an immanent\nobject of mentation is not assumed to be \u201ca reality\u201d. He\ncomplained of being misunderstood by his students, and he revised his\nposition as his thought developed. Experts continue to differ\nconsiderably over how to interpret his view. But clearly his\nconception of intentionality, and arguably that of the whole\nphenomenological tradition he influenced, is dominated by the first\nstrand of thought mentioned in Section 2\u2014intentionality as\ndirectedness towards or reference to an object\u2014and\nwhatever difficulties that brings in train.\n\nMore clearly worked out than Brentano\u2019s early, general notion of\nintentionality are his views about what he took to be its most basic\nforms (alluded to in the quote above). Brentano\u2019s philosophical\nproject of giving a typology of intentional states, their constituents\nand interdependencies\u2014what he called \u201cdescriptive\npsychology\u201d\u2014was ambitiously aimed at providing a framework\nfor experimental inquiries into causal psychological laws, as well as\nfor logic (including theory of knowledge), aesthetics, and ethics.\n\nAll intentionality, he holds, involves a presentation\n(Vorstellung) (in some sense, an appearance) of an\nobject (including mere imaginings or conceivings of objects). To this\nneutral mere appearance of an object one may then add a committal\nattitude towards it\u2014of either judgment or \u201cemotion\u201d\n(Gem\u00fct)\u2014each of which takes positive and negative\nforms. In judgment: one either affirms (accepts) or denies (rejects)\nthe presented object. In Gem\u00fct, one either\nlikes (loves or values) or dislikes (hates or\ndisvalues) it. The mere affirmation (or liking) of an object presented\ndoes not require categorizing it under a general concept, grouping it\ntogether with like instances, or anything on the order of Kantian\n\u201csynthesis\u201d.\n\nHow did Brentano relate consciousness to intentionality? He did so by\nholding first, that every mental phenomenon is \u201cof an\nobject\u201d in the intentional sense. Secondly, he held that every\nmental act is, in fact, conscious, which he took to imply there is an\nintentional consciousness of it, which in turn he construed\nas a kind of \u201cinner perception\u201d\u2014every conscious\nmental act is itself presented, and judged (accepted) as presented.\nBrentano did not consider it absurd to suppose there are\nunconscious (for him, unperceived) mental acts. But\nhe found inadequate such reasons as had been offered in his time to\nposit their occurrence. On his view, wherever this is proposed on the\ngrounds of explanatory usefulness, nonmentalistic (e.g.,\nphysiological) explanations would do as well. In this connection, he\nalso took seriously the worry that if we hold (as he does) that all\nmental acts are conscious, and all conscious acts are objects of\nconsciousness, an infinite regress would erupt. But he thought his\ntheory could handle the problem: the key was to see that, since inner\nperception is not separate from the object it makes conscious, no\nregress gets started.\n\nBrentano\u2019s lectures in Vienna attracted and inspired an\nimpressive, diverse group of central European intellectuals in the\n1870s. Of these, it was Husserl who was to have the widest\nphilosophical impact on the European Continent in the twentieth\ncentury, largely because of his influence on thinkers inspired by his\nphenomenology to explore existentialist themes\u2014Martin Heidegger,\nJean-Paul Sartre, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. Though these are the\nheirs of Brentano and Husserl on which we will focus here, a full\ntreatment of phenomenological ideas about intentionality and\nconsciousness would need to cast its net much more broadly, covering\nfigures such as: Aron Gurwitsch, Roman Ingarden, Anton Marty, Alexius\nMeinong, Adolph Reinach, Max Scheler, Edith Stein, Carl Stumpf and\nKasimir Twardowski.\n\nHusserl ([1900] 1970) adopted Brentano\u2019s concern with\nunderstanding, \u201cdescriptively\u201d, from the subject\u2019s\npoint of view, how experience is object-directed, reinterpreting\nBrentano\u2019s \u201cdescriptive psychology\u201d as\n\u201cphenomenology\u201d, and giving this a similar foundational\nrole in philosophy. However, Husserl\u2019s basic conceptions of both\nintentionality and of consciousness were significantly shaped by his\ncriticisms of Brentano\u2019s. First, consider his response to\nBrentano on intentionality. One of Husserl\u2019s principal points of\ndeparture in his early treatment of intentionality (in the Logical\nInvestigations [1900] 1970, V \u00a7\u00a7 9\u201311, 14) was\ncriticism of what he\u2014controversially\u2014took to be\nBrentano\u2019s notion of the \u201cmental inexistence\u201d of the\nobjects of thought and perception. Husserl thought it a fundamental\nerror to suppose that the object (the intentional object) of a\nthought, judgment, desire, etc. is something with a special kind of\nbeing in the mind of the thinker, judger, or desirer. For we should\nrecognize that objects of one\u2019s mental acts of thinking,\njudging, etc. often are or can be ordinary objects that\n\u201ctranscend\u201d, and enjoy some sort of independence from the\nacts (states of mind) that are directed towards them (that\n\u201cintend\u201d them, in Husserl\u2019s terms). At least if I am\nnot hallucinating, the object of my visual experience is not something\nimmanent to my mind, whose existence comes and goes with the\nexperience\u2014but something (a box, for example) that goes beyond\nor transcends any (necessarily perspectival) experience I may have of\nit, as relative position, lighting, or attention alters. This\nconception of the \u201cobjective reference\u201d of sense\nexperience is grounded in a phenomenology of perceptual constancy,\nmentioned earlier in comparison with Burge.\n\nBut how about a case in which there is no transcendent object targeted\nby one\u2019s experience, and it merely seems as if there is one, as\npresumably can occur in hallucination? Here we should say, on\nHusserl\u2019s view, not that there is an object of reference\nexisting in one\u2019s mind, but that the object intended simply does\nnot exist. This does not do away with the directedness of such\nexperience, since it is still true to say one\u2019s experience is\nof something (a snake, a dagger), even though there exists no\nsnake or dagger one then sees\u2014much as it may be true to say one\nis thinking of a golden mountain, or Zeus, though there\nexists no such mountain or god to think of. For (according to the\nLogical Investigations V \u00a7\u00a7 16\u201317,\n20) it is sufficient to make such \u201cconscious of\u201d\nstatements true that the experience have some\n\u201cmatter\u201d\u2014where the matter of a mental act\ncorresponds to what, through it, something is interpreted as.\nThis factor\u2014matter as \u201cinterpretive sense\u201d\u2014may\nvary among acts with the same object (in Husserl\u2019s example, one\nmay think of one and the same object (the Kaiser) either as the\ngrandson of Queen Victoria or as the son of Friedrich III). It also\nmay vary independently of what he called\n\u201cact-quality\u201d\u2014of whether, e.g., one judges,\nor doubts, or wonders, or hopes, or imagines, or perceives. Husserl\nheld that every intentional act must have both matter and quality.\nPost-Investigations, he came to re-interpret these notions in\nterms of what he called (in Ideas [1913] 1983) the\n\u201cnoema\u201d that can be common to distinct particular acts.\nBut this much of the basic picture seems to have survived: intentional\ndirectedness is understood not as a directedness to special (\u201cin\nmind\u201d) objects, but rather as the possession by mental acts of\nmatter/quality (or later, noematic) structure. This can be considered\na version of the content conception of intentionality described in\nSection 2, insofar as Husserl would accept that, in some sense, the\nmatter of an act (later, its \u201cnoematic sense\u201d) is the same\nas its content, that content goes with differences in\n\u201caspect\u201d, and that acts can have content even when there\nexists no object to which they refer.\n\nHowever, to say only this much leaves basic questions about\nHusserl\u2019s view unsettled. One concerns whether or in what sense\nperceptual experience ever constitutes a relation to the\nobject experienced. Here we encounter the first of the three big\nthemes announced at the outset: the question of the\n\u201cdetachability\u201d of either consciousness or intentionality\nfrom \u201cexternal\u201d \u201cworldly\u201d objects. In what\nway, if any, is the conscious subject with its intentionality in\nessence intelligible apart from objects in the world it inhabits?\n\nClearly Husserl thought that a hallucination would still be\nintentional, though there exists no object of the experience (mentally\nimmanent or otherwise) to which it relates the subject. Still, this\nleaves open whether, for Husserl, in non-hallucinatory\ncases\u2014when there really is a snake you see\u2014the\nmatter/noematic sense (thus content) of the experience properly\ncontains the experience-transcending object the experience is of, so\nthat the experience is essentially a relation to (e.g.,) this very\nwrithing, flesh-and-blood creature that can strike and bite you. On\nthis interpretation, if instead you have a subjectively\nindistinguishable snake-hallucination, you may have what is in\nother respects the same noema, minus the snake constituent.\nAlternatively, we may interpret Husserl to hold that the experience\nitself, along with its entire matter or noematic sense, is always\nessentially detachable from whatever \u201cexternal object\u201d it\nis of. (For discussion, see Crowell 2013; Drummond 1990;\nErhard 2022; A.D. Smith 2008; D.W. Smith 2007; Zahavi 2003.)\n\nInterpretations of Husserl diverge, partly due to difficulties in\nbeing clear about how to interpret his shift from the\n\u201cquality/matter\u201d to the \u201cnoema\u201d terminology,\nhis immanent/transcendent contrast, and a closely associated aspect of\nhis philosophy\u2014one to which he attached great\nimportance\u2014his method of \u201ctranscendental-phenomenological\nreduction\u201d. Husserl claimed it is possible (and, indeed,\nessential to the practice of phenomenology as an a priori\ndiscipline, distinct from psychology) that one investigate\nconsciousness in a way that withholds certain commitments concerning\nspatio-temporal particulars. Husserl held that what makes the relevant\nsuspension of commitment possible is that, given the essentially\nperspectival (in his terms, the evidentially incomplete or\n\u201cinadequate\u201d) nature of perceptual experience of an\nobject, in no case does anything subjectively evident about the actual\ncourse of your experience of an F as such completely rule out\nthe possibility that there was in fact no transcendent object, then\nexperienced as an F. (Ideas [1913] 1983 \u00a7\u00a7\n42\u201350.) On one interpretation of his methodological\n\u201cbracketing\u201d, Husserl infers that intentional experience\nis always in essence detachable from any such worldly\n(\u201cexternal\u201d) objects to which it is in fact directed.\n\nHowever, on other, \u201cexternalist\u201d \u2013or perhaps better,\n\u201crelationalist\u201d\u2014interpretations, Husserl\ndidn\u2019t deny experience is (sometimes) essentially a relation to\nexperience-transcending objects, or that its contents include these as\nconstituents. The methodological aim is just to restrict the scope of\nconcern with these objects (and hence the relevant evidence) proper to\nphenomenology: one considers them specifically only as\nintended (i.e., as interpreted) in whatever kind of experience is\nunder investigation. To this end it is unnecessary to embrace an\nontology of experiences that says they could always remain essentially\nthe same, even when detached from such objects altogether.\n\nAnother complication concerns just how Husserl would view the general\nrelationship between content in his sense (either act-matter or\nnoematic sense) and such semantic correlates of ordinary language\nsentences\u2014\u201cpropositions\u201d\u2014that some would\nidentify with the contents of states of mind reported in them.\nRelevant here are Husserl\u2019s discussions in Logical\nInvestigation VI of the relationship between the intentionality\nof perception and judgment. Husserl maintains that perception allows\nus to express judgments with demonstratives like \u201cthis\u201d\n(what he called \u201cessentially occasional\u201d terms) via\nnon-conceptual, \u201cnon-attributive\u201d senses, and that\nexperiencing features in things perceived (e.g., experiencing\nthe color or form in an object), is distinct from and underlies our\ncapacity to predicate the relevant features to them. (See\nMulligan 1995; Hopp 2011; and Kidd 2019 for discussion of relevant\nissues.) Important here too is Husserl\u2019s discussion in\nExperience and Judgment [1939] 1973 of what he called\n\u201cpre-predicative\u201d experience. Husserl holds that the sort\nof judgments we express in ordinary and scientific language are\nfounded on the intentionality of pre-predicative experience, and that\nit is crucial to clarify the way in which such experience underlies\njudgment. While Husserl rejected Brentano\u2019s general conception\nof judgment as the non-predicative affirmation of objects presented,\nhe endorsed the related idea that there is a form of intentionality,\nfound in perception, distinct from\u2014and making\npossible\u2014that in which we bring objects under general concepts.\nHere we encounter in Husserl the second of the initially announced\nthemes\u2014that of basic forms of consciousness or\nintentionality.\n\nIt is disputed how significantly the most well-known philosophers\nstrongly influenced by their study of Husserl\u2014Heidegger, Sartre,\nand Merleau-Ponty\u2014depart from him in their views. Partly this is\ndue to interpretive difficulties just mentioned (regarding the\ndetachability of experience from experience-transcending objects, and\nthe basic forms of intentionality or content). First, regarding\nrelationality and reduction: on the views of Heidegger ([1927] 1962,\n1982, 1985) and Merleau-Ponty ([1945] 2012) at least, intentionality\n(or as Heidegger prefers,\nVerhaltung\u2014\u201ccomportment\u201d) essentially\ninvolves an engagement with the world that cannot be cancelled by any\nabstention from judgment. If Husserl\u2019s reduction denies this,\nthen their responses to Husserl involve a significant break with him.\nBut as we\u2019ve seen, interpretation of the reduction is\ncontroversial. An additional complication comes when we try to\nconsider exactly how attitudes towards consciousness figure\ninto all this. If, as one interpretive approach suggests, Husserl\nholds consciousness (or rather, experience of the sort ordinarily\ninvolved in perceptual constancy) is intrinsically both relational and\nintentional, then the sort of consciousness we enjoy will be\nno more detachable in nature from its transcendent objects than is our\nintentionality. What Heidegger would have to say to this will\ndepend partly on what exactly we make of his abandoning the\nterminology of consciousness for his distinctive vocabulary of\n\u201cshowing\u201d and \u201cunconcealment/discovery\u201d. Might\nwe regard him as still speaking of consciousness, but only by other,\nallegedly less theory-burdened names? Or should we interpret Heidegger\n(in line with Crowell 2013) as maintaining (against Husserl) that\nconsciousness by itself (even of the ordinary sort we enjoy) is\ninsufficient for comportment/intentionality? How we decide to view\nthis will undoubtedly be entangled with how we ourselves understand\n\u201cconsciousness\u201d.\n\nSartre\u2019s ([1943] 1956) conception of consciousness as nothing\napart from its objects can also be interpreted as a relationalist view\n(see McCollough 1994). And in Merleau-Ponty at least, we clearly have\na version of what has since come to be known as\n\u201cdisjunctivism\u201d regarding perceptual experience: for him\nthe visual consciousness of an ashtray (his example) is either\ngenuinely seeing the ashtray\u2014or else (in illusory and\nhallucinatory cases) merely like seeing an ashtray. In the\nfirst case there is no concrete experience that would remain once the\nashtray is subtracted in thought, so as to constitute an ashtray\nhallucination. On Merleau-Ponty\u2019s account, ordinarily, when you\nsee an ashtray (a chair, a tree, etc.), your visual experience is both\nintentional and object-dependent. Our understanding of defective,\nillusory and hallucinatory cases rests on an analogy with ordinary\ncases of visual consciousness understood in an essentially relational\nmanner. This does not keep him from agreeing with Husserl that, given\nthe perspectivalness of perception, there\u2019s a sense in which one\ncan never, in a particular case, rule out the possibility that\none\u2019s experience wasn\u2019t relational after all. But this\ndoesn\u2019t make it intelligible that all one\u2019s\nexperience is non-relational, or make rational a global Cartesian\ndoubt that it ever reveals the world. (Merleau-Ponty [1945] 2012:\n308\u2013311, 359\u2013360, 393\u2013396)\n\nWhen it comes to the question of whether ordinary perception and\naction involve a kind of intentionality distinct from that of\nconceptual judgment, it seems fair to say this about Heidegger and\nMerleau-Ponty. They took up the theme of an intentionality that is\ndistinct from and makes possible the kind involved in judgments that\nposit and predicate properties of objects, and they gave this, each in\nhis own way, a strongly pragmatic cast. Heidegger describes a\ntype of understanding of entities in which they \u201cshow\nthemselves\u201d or are \u201cdiscovered\u201d as\n\u201cready-to-hand\u201d or \u201cavailable\u201d\n(zuhanden)\u2014in which they are understood in their\nfunctionality (as hammers, as doors, as pens, etc.) relative to our\naims: we understand them in using them for\nsomething. This is a kind of directedness that belongs to our everyday\npractical engagement with our surroundings. He sees this as distinct\nfrom, and making possible an understanding of entities in which they\nshow themselves as \u201cpresent-at-hand\u201d or (merely)\n\u201coccurrent\u201d (vorhanden)\u2014as they do when we\nunderstand them in a more detached or theoretical way, merely as\nobjects that possess certain properties (Heidegger [1927] 1962, 1982).\n(For a general account of Heidegger\u2019s taxonomy of understanding,\nsensitive to recent interpretive controversies, see Wrathall 2013a.)\nMerleau-Ponty [1945] 2012 developed a related view, influenced not\nonly by both Husserl and Heidegger, but by his study of Gestalt\npsychologists (who were themselves influenced by the Brentano school\nand by Husserl), in which he defends a conception of perceptual\nconsciousness as a kind of bodily understanding. Partly on\nthe basis of contrasts drawn with case studies of pathologies of\nperception and action due to brain damage, he argues that, in normal\nsensory perception, our exploratory and goal-directed movement itself\nconstitutes a way of being conscious of things\u2014and a form of\nunderstanding what is perceived\u2014not derived from activities of\nconceptual categorization and inference (which belong properly to the\nintellect). Relatedly for Merleau-Ponty: the organization and\nadjustment of movements involved in bodily understanding, though\nnorm-guided, and experienced, must not be regarded as always\nchosen\u2014 your moves are objects of personal choice only\nwhen specifically endorsed for reasons.\n\nThis may convey some central aspects of phenomenological conceptions\nof intentionality and its relation to consciousness. But what can be\nsaid about the general nature of consciousness? How did conceptions of\nthis develop in the wake of Brentano? Here too it is useful to see how\nHusserl\u2019s views emerged from criticism of\nBrentano\u2019s\u2014in particular from rejection of the\nlatter\u2019s inner perception account of consciousness. And here we\ncan see how the third of the initially identified themes\u2014that of\nreflexivity, the relation of consciousness and\nself-consciousness\u2014became elaborated in phenomenology.\n\nHusserl held that for a mental state to be conscious is for it to be\nan experience (Erlebnis), a part of some \u201cstream of\nconsciousness\u201d. Experiences in this stream of consciousness\nsense include, for Husserl, \u201cperceptions, imaginative and\npictorial representations, acts of conceptual thinking, surmises and\ndoubts, joys and griefs, hopes and fears, wishes and acts of\nwill\u201d. (For the clarification of his concept of consciousness\nfrom which this is quoted, see Husserl [1900] 1970, V\n\u00a7\u00a71\u20136.) An experience in this sense is necessarily\nexperienced (erlebt). But, contra Brentano, this\ndoes not mean that experiences continually appear as objects of some\ninner perception. (When, for example, a sensation is felt, the\nsensation is not some object of which the feeling is an appearance;\nthe sensation simply coincides with feeling it.) Husserl did,\nhowever, affirm that some kind of reflexivity is essential to\nconsciousness. Crucial to this view was a certain conception of\ntime-consciousness (Husserl 1991). Husserl argues that, distinct from\nany capacity for memory directed on an object in the past, in which\nyou recall what experience you just had, there is a sort of\n\u201cretention\u201d of what has just happened in your\nexperience (e.g., what you just heard in a melody or in a phrase) that\nenables you to perceive temporally extended wholes. Likewise, more\nbasic than any predictions about what lies in the future is\nan anticipation or \u201cprotention\u201d of what you are\nabout to experience. You are thus in a sense primitively conscious of\nyour own experience in retaining and anticipating it, even though you\ndo not thereby make it into an intentional object, as you do\nwhen, in reflection, you think and make judgments about your\nexperience. Consciousness is, for Husserl, in this way necessarily\nreflexive without necessarily being reflective. A\nsimilar view, influenced by Husserl, is prominent in Sartre\u2019s\ndoctrine that \u201cevery consciousness is a non-positional\nconsciousness of itself\u201d. Though Sartre defends this idea on the\nsomewhat different grounds that denying it would involve the\n(allegedly) absurd notion of a consciousness totally \u201cignorant\nof itself\u201d (Sartre [1937] 1957, [1942] 1956). (For recent\nexposition and defense of Sartre\u2019s view, see Williford 2016.)\n\nOne might, as Sartre did, distinguish the question of whether\nconsciousness is somehow necessarily consciousness \u201cof\nitself\u201d without becoming \u201can object for itself\u201d from\nanother reflexivity question: is all consciousness essentially, in\npart, a consciousness of oneself\u2014not \u201cas\nobject\u201d, but \u201cas subject\u201d? Sartre answered this\nquestion in the negative. All consciousness (even\n\u201cpre-reflective\u201d) is self-conscious, but only when\nreflection occurs, and consciousness becomes (as commonly it is not)\nitself an intentional object, is there any consciousness of an ego.\nHusserl earlier, in the first edition of Logical\nInvestigations, affirmed a similar view. However, he did not\nclaim, as Sartre sometimes seems to, that pre-reflective experience is\n\u201cnon-egological\u201d in the sense of being no\none\u2019s, or literally selfless, only that,\nphenomenologically, there are no grounds for regarding an ego as some\nunifying \u201ccenter\u201d of intentional relations. On this view,\nwhen I correctly say that (even pre-reflectively) an experience\nbelongs to me, I have no phenomenological\njustification to think this means anything more than that this\nexperience is a constituent in a certain unified complex\u2014a\ncertain stream of consciousness; I have no warrant to posit that the\nego, the \u201cme\u201d to whom experience belongs, constitutes a\npersisting \u201cunifier\u201d. However, Husserl (as he announces in\nthe second edition of the Logical Investigations)\nsignificantly revised his views, and held there to be a\nphenomenological case for the \u201ctranscendental ego\u201d.\nFiguring centrally in this shift was his desire to recognize an aspect\nto experience through which one is active in making\ncommitments (e.g., in judging something to be a certain way)\nthat\u2014qua personal commitments\u2014necessarily involve\na persisting \u201cI\u201d. There is a kind of consciousness of self\nin experience, which, while evident to phenomenological reflection,\ndoes not itself consist in reflectively attributing to oneself some\nproperty. (Husserl [1929] 1960 \u00a7\u00a7 31\u201333)\n\nWe may now identify three distinct ideas found in phenomenological\nthinking about the alleged reflexivity of consciousness. First, there\nis the idea that necessarily, whenever there is a conscious state,\nthere is, in some sense, consciousness of it. Second, one\nfinds the notion that it is, however, only occasionally, and\nonly in reflection, that a conscious state is simultaneously\nan intentional object for the one whose state it is. Third,\nthere is the claim that one\u2019s conscious states ordinarily\nsomehow include a non-reflective consciousness of\noneself\u2014though not as intentional object, but \u201cas\nsubject\u201d.\n\nWith these distinctions in mind, we can see that to speak of\nthe phenomenological view of these matters risks eliding\nsignificant differences. For philosophers in this tradition differed\ninterestingly with respect to the three theses just named. Brentano\nwould maintain the first, deny the second, and seems to have been\nsilent on the third. Husserl, however, (eventually) affirmed all\nthree\u2014with the first two importantly grounded in a view of\ntime-consciousness, and the third in the idea that we experience\nourselves as active understanding subjects. Sartre, meanwhile, affirms\nonly the first two theses, and embraces the second on different\ngrounds from Husserl. One may attribute some version of the second and\nthird ideas to Heidegger, since he says that when things in our\nsurroundings show themselves to us (or are \u201cuncovered\u201d)\nthrough our dealings with them, we are also thereby non-reflectively\n\u201cdisclosed\u201d to ourselves: what we are is\ndisclosed to us through our use of things as we engage in our everyday\nprojects (Heidegger 1982 \u00a715b). This may be taken to\ncommit Heidegger also to the idea that consciousness involves some\nkind of reflexive, but non-reflective, consciousness of self\nas subject. But it does so only on the assumption that, when something\nis uncovered to me in my use of it, I experience it or am somehow\nconscious of it, and that, in being disclosed to myself though my\nactivity, I am somehow self-conscious. But that interpretation would\nbe resisted by those who regard it as crucial to seeing what makes\nHeidegger differ from Husserl that we take him to deny we are\nordinarily conscious of things in dealing with them (see Dreyfus 1991;\nKa\u00fcfer and Chemero 2015). Again, these interpretive matters seem\nclosely tied to one\u2019s own assumptions about the notion of\nconsciousness. At least we might say Heidegger\u2019s view\u2019s\nabout uncoveredness and self-disclosure gives him something strongly\nanalogous to the third idea about consciousness. In any case,\nit is crucial to recognize this peculiarity of his account: unlike\nHusserl, Heidegger links such basic reflexivity (self-disclosure) to\nthe notion of an inescapable, everyday \u201cinauthentic\u201d or\nconventional self-understanding, to be contrasted with an authentic\nform that can emerge from this in a kind of\n(\u201cAngst\u201d-triggered) crisis of meaningfulness. As\nfor the first of the three reflexivity ideas (all consciousness is\n\u201cof itself\u201d), it is unclear Heidegger endorses (or even\nmentions) it at all. However, notably, Sartre bases his own\nquasi-Heideggerean interpretation of authenticity in Being and\nNothingness on his way of combining this with the second\nnotion.\n\nAll three notions are endorsed in Merleau-Ponty. But in his account\n(perhaps somewhat like Heidegger\u2019s) the second\n(non-reflectiveness) and third (experienced self-as-subject) seem to\ncarry far more weight. For Merleau-Ponty understanding oneself as\nsubject connects importantly with his notion of consciousness as\nembodied understanding: in perceiving, one experiences one\u2019s own\nbody as subject of a distinctively sensorimotor form of understanding,\nmanifest in normatively guided responses that are not analyzable as\npersonal choices made for reasons. (For discussion of\nphenomenologists\u2019 views about consciousness and its relation to\nself-consciousness that assimilates them much more than does the\npresent one, see Zahavi 1998, 2005, 2014. For further discussion\nspecifically of Brentano\u2019s views on this topic: Kriegel 2018;\nTextor 2012, 2017; and Thomasson 2000. For Heidegger, see Blattner\n2013 and Crowell 2013. For Merleau-Ponty: Siewert 2013a.)\n\nThis overview of consciousness and intentionality in the\nBrentano-Husserl tradition brings to light several broad areas of\ndiscussion. Closely related to general concerns about how to interpret\neither of these two notions, three interrelated themes have emerged.\nOne concerns whether intentionality or consciousness are\ndetachable from one\u2019s relation to the world and things\nwithin it. A second concerns how to distinguish basic forms\nof consciousness and intentionality\u2014and in particular whether,\ndistinct from the activity of the intellect or of a properly\nconceptual understanding, we should recognize something equally\nintentional on which it based, manifest in perception and action.\nFinally, there is the theme of the reflexivity of\nconsciousness: is consciousness somehow essentially bound up with a\nkind of self-consciousness\u2014either consciousness of\nitself, or of the self (as subject)? As we shall see,\nthese themes have become important\u2014somewhat later, and largely\nindependently\u2014in analytic philosophy.\n",
