    "main_text": "Philosophical Controversies || Hermeneutics and Deconstruction\n6.2 Hermeneutics and Deconstruction\n\nA further important controversy about the consequences of\nGadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics arises in the context of\nDerrida\u2019s project of deconstruction. While the relation between\nhermeneutics and deconstruction is complex, pivotal for the\ncontroversy is whether the success of understanding really achieves a\ndeterminate meaning. Gadamer, as we have seen, maintains that the\nsuccess of understanding is to understand something in its being, as\nit genuinely or truly is. Moreover, we experience such a truth as a\nclaim, one that we can agree or disagree with, and that purports to be\njustified by the interpretive experience which first gives rise to it.\nYet, as we may now observe, Gadamer\u2019s notion of the success of\nunderstanding thereby trusts in the authenticity of our own experience\nthat we really have come to understand something determinate, or, in\nany case, determinate enough that it makes a claim of truth.\nDerrida\u2019s deconstruction poses a challenge to this idea because\nDerrida argues that discursive experience is governed by an\noperation\u2014or, perhaps better, a structure of\ninoperativity\u2014that would preclude the possibility of\nunderstanding something with such determinacy (see Lawlor 2019).\n\nDerrida clarifies the character of this structure of inoperativity in\nterms of a number of concepts over the course of his career, but\nperhaps none are more influential than that of\n\u201cdiff\u00e9rance\u201d (see Derrida,\n\u201cDiff\u00e9rance\u201d). Derrida describes\ndiff\u00e9rance as a twofold structure of difference and\ndeferral. Building on terms from Saussure\u2019s linguistics,\ndiff\u00e9rance thus indicates, first of all, that in\ndiscursive experience, determining the meaning of\nsomething remains beyond our reach because linguistic signs\npresent what they are supposed to signify never per se but\nalways only heterogeneously through signifiers. And\ndiff\u00e9rance indicates, furthermore, that since this\nheterogeneity cannot be superseded, our attempts to determine the\nmeaning of something remain interminably in deferral (Derrida,\n\u201cDiff\u00e9rance\u201d). Because discursive experience is\nthus imbued with heterogeneity, our attempts to determine the meaning\nof something are not fully under our control but, instead, remain\nsubject to a free play of signs (see Derrida,\n\u201cDiff\u00e9rance,\u201d \u201cStructure, Sign and\nPlay\u201d).\n\nDerrida\u2019s deconstruction poses a challenge to Gadamer\u2019s\nnotion of the success of understanding as a hermeneutical experience\nof truth. Gadamer, as we have said, trusts that our experience of\ntruth really involves a determinate claim. Derrida\u2019s\nconsiderations suggest, however, that such trust is misplaced. If, in\nthe success of understanding, our experience purports to involve a\ndeterminate claim to truth, then our experience of this determinacy\nmust be misguided, since the possibility of determinacy is precluded\nin advance by diff\u00e9rance. As Derrida puts the point\nduring the 1981 initial meeting with Gadamer, \u201cI am not\nconvinced that we ever really have this experience that Professor\nGadamer describes, of knowing in a dialogue that one has been\nperfectly understood or experiencing the success of\nconfirmation\u201d (Derrida, \u201cThree Questions to Hans-Georg\nGadamer,\u201d 54). Indeed, in an important early essay, Derrida\nmaintains that the pursuit of success of such a kind is not merely\nmisguided, but a symptom of our suppression, perhaps repression, of an\nanxiety about the insuperable role of heterogeneity involved in all\ninterpretive experience (Derrida, \u201cStructure Sign and\nPlay,\u201d 292).\n\nGadamer takes up the challenge posed by Derrida\u2019s deconstruction\nnot primarily as an objection to his hermeneutics but, instead, as an\nimpetus to dedicate renewed attention to the role played by difference\nin interpretive experience. After all, even though philosophical\nhermeneutics does not involve the technical notion of\ndiff\u00e9rance, Gadamer\u2019s hermeneutics makes space\nfor difference in important regards. First, Gadamer certainly\nrecognizes that every determinate claim of truth remains open to\nfurther interpretation. And, second, he recognizes that the\nhermeneutical experience of a determine claim of truth is itself a\nlegacy of difference, since interpretive experience unfolds in the\nfree play of conversation. Gadamer\u2019s response to the challenge\nposed by deconstruction unfolds in attempts to expand and deepen these\nand related considerations of the role played by difference in\ninterpretive experience. Gadamer develops this response in a number of\nessays, and is led to develop hermeneutical considerations of a number\nof themes brought into focus by his encounter with Derrida, such as\nthe significance of what he calls the eminent text (see for example\nGadamer, \u201cHermeneutics Tracking the Trace,\u201d and\n\u201cText and Interpretation\u201d). Matters of central concern for\nthe philosophical controversy between hermeneutics and deconstruction\nhave also been further developed by several philosophers associated\nwith hermeneutics, such as John Caputo (1987), James Risser (1997),\nDonatella di Cesare (2003) and others.\n",
