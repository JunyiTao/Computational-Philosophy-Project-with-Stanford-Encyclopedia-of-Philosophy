Indeed, in all the current quantum theories in which the\nprobability of the R-outcome depends on some controllable physical\nvariable in the L-wing, this dependence is not due to a continuous\nprocess. Rather, it is due to some type of \u2018action\u2019 or (to\nuse Shimony's (1984) terminology) \u2018passion\u2019 at a distance,\nwhich is the \u2018result\u2019 of the holistic nature of the\nquantum realm, the non-separability of the state of entangled systems,\nor the non-separable nature of the evolution of the properties of\nsystems. \n",
