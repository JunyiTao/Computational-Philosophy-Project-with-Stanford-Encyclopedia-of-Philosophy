    "main_text": "Revisiting Biological Complexity || Reverse and Forward Tinkering?\n3.1 Reverse and Forward Tinkering?\n\nRather than following a fixed design protocol, research in synthetic\nbiology often progresses through what is taken to be the opposite of\nrational design, namely kludging: a solution that is\nklumsy, lame, ugly, dumb but\ngood enough (O\u2019Malley 2009, 2011b). The\nresearch process can perhaps be described as reverse and\nforward tinkering, in which opportunities for modular\ndecomposition and recomposition are explored in iterative cycles to\narrive at piecemeal solutions. Some have argued that synthetic biology\nexhibits a reflexive double bind to engineering, because the design\nassumptions guiding the construction of the synthetic systems are\ncontinuously reevaluated (Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a). That is,\nsynthetic biology does not only progress through similarities between\nbiology and engineering. Through the exploration of engineering\napproaches, important differences (or negative analogies)\nbetween biological and engineered systems are discovered (Knuuttila\n& Loettgers 2014)\n\nAn example of a possible negative analogy discussed in this context is\nthe role of noise in biological versus engineered systems. In\nengineering, oscillations are often associated with noise and lack of\nprecision, but oscillatory dynamics are characteristic of many\nbiological processes including metabolism and day and night rhythms\n(Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a; see also Bechtel 2016). To study\noscillations in gene expression, synthetic biologists at the Elowitz\nlab constructed a synthetic genetic circuit called the\nrepressilator (Elowitz & Leibler 2000). The repressilator\nwas designed to test whether the oscillatory dynamics of gene\nexpression could be mathematically described via connected feedback\nloops in a simple regulatory circuit and implemented in a synthetic\nmodel.\n\nInterestingly, important insights resulted from the repressilator\nbecause it failed to produce regular oscillations as\npredicted by the underlying mathematical model. The mismatch between\nthe mathematical and synthetic model led to a reevaluation of the\nassumptions underlying the deterministic mathematical model (Knuuttila\n& Loettgers 2013a, 2014). Subsequent investigation of the dynamics\nof a stochastic version of the same model suggested that noise may be\nan inherent feature of oscillations in gene expression in living\ncells. The exploration of the functional role of noise and the\npotentials for stochastic modeling has since developed into an\nimportant research program of interest to biologists and engineers\nalike (Briat et al. 2016; Munsky et al. 2009; O\u2019Malley 2011b).\nThe repressilator and similar examples also sparked debates on whether\ndesign procedures in synthetic biology need to account for cellular\ncontexts, distributed organization of functions, and other features\nthat are unlike modular machines (G\u00fcttinger\n 2013).[6]\n\nTo what extent the ideal of precision engineering is pursued in\nsynthetic biology is therefore debatable. Some have stressed the\ncentrality of the engineering perspective because the construction of\nsynthetic models is guided by knowledge on which design principles can\nbe expected to create specific dynamic behaviors (e.g., Gramelsberger\n2013). Others have emphasized that synthetic modeling, as a kind of\nmaterial recomposition strategy, offer material constraints\nthat always involve open-ended aspects (Knuuttila & Loettgers\n2013b). The latter view highlights exploratory features of the\ntriangulation of mathematical, computational, and synthetic\napproaches. The notion of exploratory experimentation has\nalso been used to characterize research processes in systems biology,\nwhere scholars search for structural and functional patterns in\nbiological networks without being driven by a specific biological\nhypothesis (O\u2019Malley & Soyer 2012; Steinle 1997). Research\non network motifs\n (Section 1.1.1)\n is one example where engineering approaches were applied in an\nexploratory fashion to generate, rather than test, hypotheses on\nbiological functions (Alon 2007). Also in this context, the analysis\nmay lead to a reevaluation of design assumptions, e.g., whether the\nfunctions of network motifs are independent of the network context\nthey are embedded in (Isalan et al. 2008).\n\nIt should also be noted that synthetic biologists often aim to produce\nbiological technology that is more machine-like than natural organisms\n(Kastenhofer 2013a,b; O\u2019Malley 2011b). An alternative response\nto biological complexity may therefore be to make the designed system\nsimpler, for instance through genetic rewiring that ensures a higher\ndegree of modularity (Knuuttila & Loettgers 2013a). The explicit\naim to simplify synthetic models has been interpreted as\nacknowledgment of biological complexity, and it is therefore debated\nwhether the criticism of the machine-view in synthetic biology is\nmisguided (cf., Holm 2015; Nicholson 2013). The heuristic value of\ndesign approaches is, however, an ongoing topic of debate in both\nsystems and synthetic biology.\n",
