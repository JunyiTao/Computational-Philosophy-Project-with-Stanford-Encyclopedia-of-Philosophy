    "main_text": "Further aspects of medieval probability || Order relations between probabilities\n4.2 Order relations between probabilities\n\nPre-modern probability was not a number or ratio, but mainly a binary\nproperty which a proposition either had or did not have. Yet\npre-modern probability was also an ordinal concept. Some propositions\nwere regarded as more probable (probabilior,\nprobabilius) than others. More probable opinions were a\nsubclass of probable opinions. Consequently, an opinion had at least\nto be probable in order to be more probable than another opinion. In\nline with these premises, strict order relations (i.e.\n\u201c>\u201d and \u201c<\u201d) for opinions were common in\nmedieval and Renaissance philosophy. In the Middle Ages,\nattributions of equal probability did exist but seemed to be less\n widespread.[36]\n An equilibrium between opposing reasons led to doubt\n(dubium). However, it is important to note that the ethical\nprinciples guiding decisions in a state of doubt were distinct from\nthose applied when choosing between probable opinions.\n",
