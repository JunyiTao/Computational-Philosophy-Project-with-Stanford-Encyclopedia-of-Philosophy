    "main_text": "\n\nThe word \u2018pluralism\u2019 generally refers to the view that\nthere are many of the things in question (concepts, scientific world\nviews, discourses, viewpoints etc.) The issues arising from there\nbeing many differ widely from subject area to subject area. This entry\nis concerned with moral pluralism\u2014the view that there are many\ndifferent moral values.\n\nMoral value pluralism should be distinguished from political\npluralism. Political pluralism, which, like moral value pluralism, is\noften referred to as \u2018value pluralism\u2019, is a view\nassociated with political liberalism. Political pluralism is concerned\nwith the question of what sort of restrictions governments can put on\npeople\u2019s freedom to act according to their values. One version\nof political pluralism is based on moral value pluralism, claiming\nthat there are irreducibly plural moral values and that this justifies\na liberal political system. (See Isaiah Berlin 1969; George Crowder\n2002, 2019; William Galston 2002, and for a more detailed discussion\nof this see the entry on\n Isaiah Berlin).\n Political Liberalism need not be based on value pluralism: a defence\nof toleration of different value systems need not rely on the claim\nthat there are plural moral values. We shall leave political pluralism\naside for the purposes of this entry, and concentrate on moral value\npluralism.\n\nIt is also worth emphasising that moral value pluralism does not\nentail relativism. The idea is not that all values or value systems\nare equally true. Value pluralism is independent of any particular\nmeta-ethical view. It is a claim about the normative domain: about\nwhat value looks like.\n\nCommonsensically we talk about lots of different\nvalues\u2014happiness, liberty, friendship, and so on. The question\nabout pluralism in moral theory is whether these apparently different\nvalues are all reducible to one supervalue, or whether we should think\nthat there really are several distinct values.\n\nThere are different ways that value might be conceived, but the debate\nabout pluralism should be able to cut across different sorts of moral\ntheory. Traditionally, moral philosophers recognize three different\nways of thinking about morality: the deontological way, the\nconsequentialist way, and the virtue ethics way, although there is\ndebate about the cogency of these\n distinctions.[1]\n The term \u2018value\u2019 as it appears in \u2018value\npluralism\u2019 is neutral between these three theories.\nDeontologists think of morality as being fundamentally about moral\nprinciples. Thus the question of whether a deontological theory is\npluralist is a question about how many fundamental principles there\nare. The consequentialist, by contrast, tends to see value as being\nrealized by goods in the world, such as friendship, knowledge, beauty\nand so on, and the question of pluralism is thus a question about how\nmany fundamental goods there are. Virtue ethicists focus on how agents\nshould be, so are interested both in principles of action (or\nmotivation) and the pursuit of goods, such as friendship.\n\nDeontologists can clearly be monists or pluralists. Kant can be\nunderstood as a monist\u2014arguing that there is one overarching\nprinciple, and that all other principles are derived from it. Ross, by\ncontrast, is a pluralist, because he thinks that there is a plurality\nof prima facie duties. (See Kant (1948), Ross\n (1930).)[2]\n\nMany utilitarians are monists, arguing that there is only one\nfundamental value and that is well-being or pleasure or happiness, or\nsomething of that sort. In other words, some utilitarians are\ncommitted to hedonism. Monist utilitarians must claim that all other\nputative values, such as friendship, knowledge and so on, are only\ninstrumental values, which are valuable in so far as they contribute\nto the foundational value. But utilitarians need not be monists.\nAmartya Sen, for example, argues that utilitarians can take a\n\u2018vector view of utility\u2019, according to which there are\ndifferences in the qualities as well of the quantities of utility in\ngoods in the world. According to Sen, we should interpret Mill as a\npluralist in this way. (We return to Mill below: it is not entirely\nclear how we should understand his view). Sen points out that desire\nsatisfaction theorists can be pluralists too. Just as different sorts\nof pleasure might have different sorts of value, so different desires\nmight have different sorts of value. (Sen, 1981). Even utilitarians\nwho claim that the value to be maximized is well-being can be\npluralist: a prominent view of well-being is that well-being itself is\nplural, an objective list of things that are fundamentally plural.\n(See Finnis 1980; Griffin 1986; for recent defences see Fletcher 2013;\nLin 2014). Another reason to think that hedonistic utilitarians should\nbe pluralists is that it seems essential to say something about the\ndisvalue of pain. As Shelly Kagan points out (2014), we need an\naccount of ill-being in addition to an account of well-being.\n\nIn what follows, the presentation will be as neutral as possible\nbetween different theoretical approaches to morality, and will focus\non the debate between monists and pluralists. Monists claim that there\nis only one ultimate value. Pluralists argue that there really are\nseveral different values, and that these values are not reducible to\neach other or to a supervalue. Monism has the advantage of relative\nsimplicity: once it has been determined what the supervalue is\n(whether we think of the super value in terms of the goods approach or\nany other approach) much of the hard work has been done. On the other\nhand, monism may be too simple: it may not capture the real texture of\nour ethical lives. However, pluralism faces the difficulty of\nexplaining how different fundamental values relate to each other, and\nhow they can be compared.\n",
