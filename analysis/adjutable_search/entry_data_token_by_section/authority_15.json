The instrumentalist\napproach seems to be committed to the idea that an authority can be\nlegitimate even if most of the members of the society do not agree with\nwhat it is doing. As long as the state is requiring people to act as\nthey should act, the subjects have a duty to obey, even if they do not\nsee that they have this duty. Now one can see how this may be true in\nsome circumstances, where the members are deeply immoral or irrational.\nBut it seems perverse to think that whether the state has legitimate\nauthority is completely independent of the considered opinions of its\nsubjects. Here is the reason behind the appearance. The state, being a\ngroup of people, owes the subjects some kind of duty of respect for the\njudgments of those members. This duty of respect requires at least some\ndegree of responsiveness on the part of the state in making decisions.\nFurthermore the state, in part, is an institution that is grounded in\nthe need for decisions against a background of disagreement about what\nought to be done. For the state to make decisions against this\nbackground that completely ignores the views of the many dissenters\nseems a particularly egregious violation of the duty to accord some\nrespect to the opinions of reasonable adult human beings.\n\n\nConsent theories, reasonable consensus theories, associative\nobligation theories and democratic theories make these observations\npart of the foundation of their accounts of the legitimacy of\nauthority. The consent theory of political authority requires that for\nthe state to have authority over any person, the state must have the\nconsent of the person to that authority. Consent, on this account, is a\nnecessary condition of the legitimacy of authority though it need not\nbe a sufficient condition. The consent theory clearly makes an attempt\nto make political authority compatible with a due respect for the\nopinions of subjects.\n",
