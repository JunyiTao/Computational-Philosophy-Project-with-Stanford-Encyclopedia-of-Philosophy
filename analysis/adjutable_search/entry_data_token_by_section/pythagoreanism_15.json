    "main_text": "Neopythagoreanism || The Pythagorean Pseudepigrapha\n4.2 The Pythagorean Pseudepigrapha\n\nAlthough the origins of Neopythagoreanism are thus found in the fourth\ncentury BCE, the figures more typically labeled Neopythagoreans belong\nto the upsurge in interest in Pythagoreanism that begins in the first\ncentury BCE and continues through the rest of antiquity. Before\nturning to these Neopythagoreans, it is important to discuss another\naspect of the later Pythagorean tradition, the Pythagorean\npseudepigrapha. Many more writings forged in the name of Pythagoras\nand other Pythagoreans have survived than genuine writings. Most of\nthe pseudepigrapha themselves only survive in excerpts quoted by\nanthologists such as John of Stobi, who created a collection of Greek\ntexts for the edification of his son in early fifth century CE. The\nmodern edition of these Pythagorean pseudepigrapha by Thesleff (1965)\nruns to some 245 pages.\n\nThere is much uncertainly as to when, where, why and by whom these\nworks were created. No one answer to these questions will fit all of\nthe treatises. Most scholars (e.g., Burkert 1972b, 40\u201344;\nCentrone 1990, 30\u201334, 41\u201344 and 1994) have chosen Rome or\nAlexandria between 150 BCE and 100 CE as the most likely time and\nplace for these compositions, since there was a strong resurgence of\ninterest in Pythagoreanism in these places at these times (see below).\nThesleff\u2019s view that the majority were composed in the third\ncentury BCE in southern Italy (1961 and 1972, 59) has found less\nfavor. Centrone argues convincingly that a central core of the\npseudepigrapha were forged in the first centuries BCE and CE in\nAlexandria, because of their close connection to Eudorus and Philo,\nwho worked in Alexandria in that period (Centrone 2014a). For an\noverview of the Pythagorean pseudepigrapha see Centrone 2014a and\nMoraux 1984, 605\u2013683.\n\nA number of motives probably led to the forgeries. The existence of\navid collectors of Pythagorean books such as Juba, King of Mauretania\n(see below), and the scarcity of authentic Pythagorean texts will have\nled to forgeries to sell for profit to the collectors. Other short\nletters or treatises may have originated as exercises for students in\nthe rhetorical schools (e.g., the assignment might have been to write\nthe letter that Archytas wrote to Dionysius II of Syracuse asking that\nPlato be freed; see Diogenes Laertius III 21\u201322). The contents\nof the treatises suggest, however, that the primary motivation was to\nprovide the Pythagorean texts to support the Neopythagorean position,\nfirst adumbrated in the early Academy, that Pythagoras was the source\nof all that is true in the Greek philosophical tradition. The\npseudepigrapha show the Pythagoreans anticipating the most\ncharacteristic ideas of Plato and Aristotle. Most of the treatises are\ncomposed in the Doric dialect (spoken in Greek S. Italy) but, apart\nfrom that concession to verisimilitude, there is little other attempt\nto make them appear to be archaic documents that anticipated Plato and\nAristotle. Instead, Plato\u2019s and Aristotle\u2019s philosophical\npositions are stated in a bald fashion using the exact Platonic and\nAristotelian terminology. In many cases, however, this glorification\nof Pythagoras may not have been the final goal. The ancient authority\nof Pythagoras was sometimes used to argue for a specific\ninterpretation of Plato, often an interpretation that showed Plato as\nhaving anticipated and having responded to criticisms of Aristotle.\nFor example, in defense of the interpretation of Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus, which defends Plato against Aristotle\u2019s\ncriticisms by claiming that the creation of the world in the\nTimaeus is metaphorical, a Platonist could point to the\nforged treatise of Timaeus of Locri which does present the generation\nas metaphorical but which can also be regarded as Plato\u2019s\nsource. These pseudo-Pythagorean treatises are adopting the same\nstrategy as Eudorus of Alexandria and thus may be more important for\ndebates within later Platonism than for Pythagoreanism per se\n(Bonazzi 2013). \n\nOne plausible explanation of the sudden proliferation of Pythagorean\npseudepigrapha in the first century BCE and first century CE is the\nreappearance of Aristotle\u2019s esoteric writings in the middle of\nthe first century BCE (Kalligas 2004, 39\u201342). In those treatises\nPlato is presented as adopting a pair of principles, the one and the\nindefinite dyad, which are not obvious in the dialogues, but which\nAristotle compares to the Pythagorean principles limit and unlimited\n(e.g., Metaph. 987b19\u2013988a1). Aristotle can be read,\nalthough probably incorrectly, as virtually identifying Platonism and\nPythagoreanism in these passages. Thus, Pythagorean enthusiasts may\nhave felt emboldened by this reading of Aristotle to create the\nsupposed original texts upon which Plato drew. They may also have\nfound support for this in Plato\u2019s making the south-Italian\nTimaeus his spokesman in the dialogue of the same name. It is thus not\nsurprising that the most famous of the pseudepigrapha is the treatise\nsupposedly written by this Timaeus of Locri (Marg 1972), which has\nsurvived complete and which is clearly intended to represent the\noriginal document on which Plato drew, although it, in fact, also\nresponds to criticisms made of Plato\u2019s dialogue in the first\ncouple of centuries after it was written (Ryle 1965, 176\u2013178).\nThe treatise of Timaeus of Locri is first mentioned by Nicomachus in\nthe second century CE (Handbook 11) and is thus commonly\ndated to the first century CE. Another complete short treatise (13\npages in Thesleff) is On the Nature of the Universe\nsupposedly by the Pythagorean Ocellus (Harder 1966), which has\npassages that are almost identical to passages in Aristotle\u2019s\nOn Generation and Corruption. Since Ocellus\u2019 work is\nfirst mentioned by the Roman polymath, Varro, scholars have dated it\nto the first half of the first century BCE. Although Plato was in\ngeneral more closely associated with the Pythagorean tradition than\nAristotle, a significant number of Pythagorean pseudepigrapha follow\n\u2018Ocellus\u2019 in drawing on Aristotle (see Karamanolis 2006,\n133\u2013135).\n\nIt is likely that in some cases letters were forged in order to\nauthenticate these forged treatises. Thus a correspondence between\nPlato and Archytas dealing with the acquisition of the writings of\nOcellus (Diogenes Laertius VIII 80\u201381) may be intended to\nvalidate the forgery in Ocellus\u2019 name (Harder 1966, 39ff). A\nletter from Lysis to Hipparchus (Thesleff 1965, 111\u2013114), which\nenjoyed considerable fame in the later tradition and is quoted by\nCopernicus, urges that the master\u2019s doctrines not be presented\nin public to the uninitiated and recounts Pythagoras\u2019\ndaughter\u2019s preservation of his \u201cnotebooks\u201d\n(hypomn\u00eamata) in secrecy, although she could have sold\nthem for much money (see Riedweg 2005, 120\u2013121). Burkert (1961,\n17\u201328) has argued that this letter was forged to authenticate\nthe \u201cPythagorean Notes\u201d from which Alexander Polyhistor\n(1st century BCE) derived his influential account of Pythagoreanism\n(Diogenes Laertius VIII 24\u201336 \u2014 see the end of this\nsection and for Alexander see section 4.5 below). While some of\nPythagoras\u2019 teachings were undoubtedly secret, many were not,\nand the claim of secrecy in the letter of Lysis is used to explain\nboth the previous lack of early Pythagorean documents and the recent\n\u201cdiscovery\u201d of what are in reality forged documents, such\nas the notebooks.\n\nThere are fewer forged treatises in Pythagoras\u2019 name than in the\nname of other Pythagoreans and they are a very varied group suggesting\ndifferent origins. Callimachus, in the third century BCE, knew of a\nspurious astronomical work circulating in Pythagoras\u2019 name\n(Diogenes Laertius IX 23) and there may have been a similar work\nforged in the second century (Burkert 1961, 28\u201342). A group of\nthree books, On Education, On Statesmanship and\nOn Nature, were forged in Pythagoras\u2019 name sometime\nbefore the second century BCE (Diogenes Laertius VIII 6 and 9; Burkert\n1972a, 225). Heraclides Lembus, in the second century BCE, knew of at\nleast six other works in Pythagoras\u2019 name, all of which must\nhave been spurious, including a Sacred Discourse (Diogenes\nLaertius VIII 7). The thesis that the historical Pythagoras wrote a\nSacred Discourse should be rejected (Burkert 1972a, 219).\nThere was also a spurious treatise on the magical properties of plants\nand the Golden Verses, which are discussed further below\n(sect. 4.5). On the spurious treatises assigned to Pythagoras see\nCentrone 2014a, 316\u2013318.\n\nArchytas\n appears to have been the most popular name in which to forge\ntreatises. Some 45 pages are devoted to pseudo-Archytan treatises in\nThesleff\u2019s collection as compared to 30 pages for Pythagoras.\nThe most famous of the pseudo-Archytan texts is The Whole System\nof Categories, which, along with On Opposites,\nrepresents the attempt to claim Aristotle\u2019s system of categories\nfor the Pythagoreans. The pseudo-Archytan works on categories are very\nfrequently cited by the commentators on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories (e.g., Simplicius and Syrianus) and were regarded\nas authentic by them, but in fact include modifications made to\nAristotle\u2019s theory in the first century BCE and probably were\ncomposed in that century (Szlezak 1972). Another treatise, On\nPrinciples, is full of Aristotelian terminology such as\n\u201cform,\u201d \u201csubstance,\u201d and \u201cwhat\nunderlies\u201d; On Intelligence and Perception contains a\nparaphrase of the divided line passage in Plato\u2019s\nRepublic. There are also a series of pseudepigrapha on ethics\nby Archytas and other authors (Centrone 1990). Philolaus, the third\nmost famous Pythagorean after Pythagoras and Archytas, also turns up\nas the author of several spurious treatises, but a number of the\nforgeries were in the names of obscure or otherwise unknown\nPythagoreans. Thus, Callikratidas and Metopos are presented as\nanticipating Plato\u2019s doctrine of the tripartite soul and as\nusing Plato\u2019s exact language to articulate it (Thesleff 1965,\n103.5 and 118.1\u20134). Although there are indications that some\nancient scholars had doubts about the authenticity of the\npseudo-Pythagorean texts, for the most part they succeeded in their\npurpose all too well and were accepted as genuine texts on which Plato\nand Aristotle drew.\n\nAlthough the pseudepigrapha are too varied to admit of one origin,\nCentrone has recently argued that a core group of pseudepigrapha do\nappear to be part of a single project (2014a). They are written in\nDoric Greek (the dialect used in southern Italy where the Pythagoreans\nflourished) in order to give them the appearance of authenticity and\nshare a common style. There are some twenty-five treatises belonging\nto this group and they include some of the most famous pseudepigrapha,\nincluding the work by ps.-Timaeus that was supposed to be\nPlato\u2019s model, ps.-Archytas\u2019 works on categories and\nps.-Ocellus On the Universe. These treatises espouse the same\nbasic system and seem designed to cover all the basic fields of\nknowledge. The system is based on theory of principles in which God is\nthe supreme entity above a pair of principles, one of which is limited\nand the other unlimited, and which are identified with Aristotelian\nform and matter. This system is very similar to what is found in\nEudorus, a Platonist working in Alexandria in the fist cenutury BCE.\nStarting from these principles a common system is then developed which\napplies to theology, cosmology, ethics, and politics. The connections\nto Eudorus and to Philo who also worked in Alexandria, very much\nsuggest that this group of treatises was developed as a coherent\nproject in Alexandria sometime in the first century BCE or the first\ncentury CE.\n\nOne important group of Pythagorean pseudepigrapha are those forged in\nthe names of Pythagorean women. Although some work has been done on\nthem there is still a pressing need for a comprehensive collection of\nthese texts and a study of them in light of the most recent\nscholarship on Pythagoreanism. Pomeroy 2013 provides some useful\ncommentary but has serious drawbacks (see Centrone 2014b and Brodersen\n2014). Many of the texts are collected in Thesleff 1965 under the\nnames Theano, Periktione, Melissa, Myia and Phintys and taken together\noccupy about 15 pages of text. To Periktione are assigned two\nfragments from a treatise On the Harmony of a Woman.\nPeriktione is the name of Plato\u2019s mother and it is probable that\nhers is the famous name in which these works were forged. Two further\nfragments from On Wisdom are also assigned to her. These\nfragments show a strong similarity to fragments from a treatise with\nidentical title by Archytas and are likely to have been assigned to\nPeriktione by mistake. Two fragments from a work On the Temperance\nof a Woman are assigned to Phintys. For Theano, the most famous\nPythagorean woman (see 3.3 above), one fragment of a work On\nPiety is preserved as well as the titles of several other works,\nnumerous apophthegms and a number of letters. On Theano in the\npseudepigraphal tradition see Huizenga 2013, 96\u2013117. Melissa and\nMyia are represented by one letter each. With few exceptions the works\nfocus on female virtue, proper marital conduct, and practical issues\nsuch as how to choose a wet nurse and how to deal with slaves. The\nadvice is quite conservative, stressing obedience to one\u2019s\nhusband, chastity and temperance. There is little that is specifically\nPythagorean. Since the authors are pseudonymous it is impossible to be\nsure whether they were in fact written by women using female\npseudonyms or men using female pseudonyms (Huizenga 2013, 116). In the\ncase of the letters St\u00e4dele\u2019s edition (1980) is to be\npreferred to Thesleff (1965). The letters of Melissa and Myia along\nwith three letters of Theano are often found together in the\nmanuscript tradition and may have come to be seen as offering a\ncurriculum for the moral training of women (Huizenga 2013). Due to the\ndearth of preserved writings by women from the ancient world some have\nbeen tempted to suppose that the writings are genuine works by the\nnamed authors. However, as demonstrated above, Pythagorean\npseudepigrapha were very widespread and more common than genuine\nPythagorean works. In such a context the onus of proof is on someone\nwho wants to show that a work is genuine. The content of the writings\nby Pythagorean women is simply too general to make a convincing case\nthat a specific writing could only have been written by the supposed\nauthor rather than by a later forger. In fact, the writings by women\nfit the pattern of the rest of the pseudepigrapha very well. They are\ngenerally forged in the name of famous Pythagorean women, whose names\ngive authority to the advice imparted (Huizenga 2013, 117). How better\ncould one impart force to advice to women than to assign that advice\nto women who belonged to the philosophical school that gave most\nprominence to women? The pseudepigrapha written in the names of\nPythagorean women probably mostly date to the first centuries BCE and\nCE like the other Pythagorean pseudepigrapha, but certainty is not\npossible. \n\nOne of the most discussed treatises among the pseudepigrapha are the\nPythagorean Notes, which were excerpted by Alexander\nPolyhistor in the first century BCE, who was in turn quoted by\nDiogenes Laertius in his Life of Pythagoras (VIII\n24\u201333). Thus the Notes date before the middle of the\nfirst century BCE (probably towards the end of the third century BCE\n[Burkert 1972a, 53]) and are earlier than most pseudepigrapha. In\nDiogenes\u2019 life the Pythagorean Notes serve as the main\nstatement of Pythagoras\u2019 philosophical views. The treatise is\nwildly eclectic, drawing from Plato\u2019s Timaeus, the\nearly Academy and Stocisim and the scholarly consensus is that the\ntreatise is a forgery (Burkert 1961, 26ff., Long 2013, Laks 2014). It\nis tempting to suppose that some early material may be preserved\namidst later material, but the text is such an amalgam that it is in\npractice impossible to identify securely any early material (Burkert\n1961, 26; Laks 2014, 375). The Notes are well organized and\npresent a complete if compressed philosophy organized around the\nconcept of purity (Laks 2014). Starting from basic principles (the\nPlatonic monad and dyad) they give an account of the world, living\nbeings, and the soul ending with moral precepts (some of the\nPythagorean acusmata). Kahn thought that the treatise\nreflected a Pythagorean community that was active in the Hellenistic\nperiod (2001, 83) but Long is more likely to be right that its learned\neclecticism suggests that it is a scholarly creation (Long 2013,\n158\u2013159).\n4.3 Neopythagorean Metaphysics: Eudorus, Moderatus, Numenius and Hippolytus\n\n\u201cNeopythagorean\u201d is a modern label, which overlaps with\ntwo other modern labels, \u201cMiddle Platonist\u201d and\n\u201cNeoplatonist,\u201d so that a given figure will be called a\nNeoplatonist or Middle Platonist by some scholars and a Neopythagorean\nby others. There are several different strands in Neopythagoreanism.\nOne strand focuses on Pythagoras as a master metaphysician. In this\nguise he is presented as the author of a theory of principles, which\nwent even beyond the principles of Plato\u2019s later metaphysics,\nthe one and the indefinite dyad, and which shows similarities to the\nNeoplatonic system of Plotinus. The first Neopythagorean in this sense\nis Eudorus of Alexandria, who was active in the middle and later part\nof the first century BCE. He evidently presented his own innovations\nas the work of the Pythagoreans (Dillon 1977, 119). According to\nEudorus, the Pythagoreans posited a single supreme principle, known as\nthe one and the supreme god, which is the cause of all things. Below\nthis first principle are a second one, which is also called the monad,\nand the indefinite dyad. These latter two are Plato\u2019s principles\nin the unwritten doctrines, but Eudorus says they are properly\nspeaking elements rather than principles (Simplicius, in\nPhys., CAG IX 181. 10\u201330). The system of\nprinciples described by Eudorus also appears in the pseudo-Pythagorean\nwritings (e.g., pseudo-Archytas, On Principles; Thesleff\n1965, 19) and it is hard to be certain in which direction the\ninfluence went (Dillon 1977, 120\u2013121). On Eudorus\u2019\nconnection to the pseudo-Pythagorean writings see also Bonazzi 2013\nand Centrone 2014. A generation after Eudorus, another Alexandrian,\nthe Jewish thinker Philo, used a Pythagorean theory of principles,\nwhich is similar to that found in Eudorus, and Pythagorean number\nsymbolism in order to give a philosophical interpretation of the\nOld Testament (Kahn 2001, 99\u2013104; Dillon 1977,\n139\u2013183). Philo\u2019s goal was to show that Moses was the\nfirst philosopher. For Philo Pythagoras and his travels to the east\nevidently played a crucial role in the transmission of philosophy to\nthe Greeks (Dillon 2014). Philo like Eudorus has close connections to\nthe Pythagorean pseudepigrapha (Centrone 2014). \n\nModeratus of Gades (modern Cadiz in Spain), who was active in the\nfirst century CE, shows similarities to Eudorus in his treatment of\nPythagorean principles. Plutarch explicitly labels him a Pythagorean\nand presents his follower, Lucius, as living a life in accord with the\nPythagorean taboos, known as symbola or acusmata\n(Table Talk 727b). It is thus tempting to assume that\nModeratus too lived a Pythagorean life (Dillon 1977, 345). His\nphilosophy is only preserved in reports of other thinkers, and it is\noften difficult to distinguish what belongs to Moderatus from what\nbelongs to the source.\n\nHe wrote a comprehensive eleven volume work entitled Lectures on\nPythagoreanism from which Porphyry quotes in sections 48\u201353\nof his Life of Pythagoras. In this passage, Moderatus argues\nthat the Pythagoreans used numbers as a way to provide clear teaching\nabout bodiless forms and first principles, which cannot be expressed\nin words. In another excerpt, he describes a Pythagorean system of\nprinciples, which appears to be developed from the first two\ndeductions of the second half of Plato\u2019s Parmenides. In\nthis system there are three ones: the first one which is above being,\na second one which is identified with the forms and which is\naccompanied by intelligible matter (i.e. the indefinite dyad) and a\nthird one which is identified with soul. The first two ones show\nconnections to Eudorus\u2019 account of Pythagorean first principles;\nthe whole system anticipates central ideas of the most important\nNeoplatonist, Plotinus (Dillon 1977, 346\u2013351; Kahn 2001,\n105\u2013110).\n\nModeratus was a militant Neopythagorean, who explicitly charges that\nPlato, Aristotle and members of the early academy claimed as their own\nthe most fruitful aspects of Pythagorean philosophy with only small\nchanges, leaving for the Pythagoreans only those doctrines that were\nsuperficial, trivial and such as to bring discredit on the school\n(Porphyry, VP 53). These trivial doctrines have been thought\nto be the various taboos preserved in the symbola, but, since\nhis follower Lucius is explicitly said to follow the symbola,\nit seems unlikely that Moderatus was critical of them. The charge of\nplagiarism might suggest that Moderatus was familiar with the\npseudo-Pythagorean treatises, which appear to have been forged in part\nto show that Pythagoras had anticipated the main ideas of Plato and\nAristotle (see Kahn 2001, 105).\n\nIt is with Numenius (see Dillon 1977, 361\u2013379 and Kahn 2001,\n118\u2013133, and the entry on\n Numenius,\n especially section 2), who flourished ca. 150 CE in Apamea in\nnorthern Syria (although he may have taught at Rome), that\nNeopythagoreanism has the clearest direct contact with the great\nNeoplatonist, Plotinus. Porphyry reports that Plotinus was, in fact,\naccused of having plagiarized from Numenius and that, in response,\nAmelius, a devotee of Numenius\u2019 writings and follower of\nPlotinus, wrote a treatise entitled Concerning the Difference\nBetween the Doctrines of Plotinus and Numenius (Life of\nPlotinus 3 and 17). The third century Platonist, Longinus, to a\ndegree describes Plotinus himself as a Neopythagorean, saying that\nPlotinus developed the exegesis of Pythagorean and Platonic first\nprinciples more clearly than his predecessors, who are identified as\nNumenius, his follower Cronius, Moderatus and Thrasyllus, all\nNeopythagoreans (Porphyry, Life of Plotinus 20). Numenius\nalso had considerable influence on Porphyry (Macris 2014, 396),\nIamblichus (O\u2019Meara 2014, 404\u2013405) and Calcidius (Hicks\n2014, 429).\n\nNumenius is regularly described as a Pythagorean by the sources that\ncite his fragments such as Eusebius (e.g. Fr. 1, 4b, 5 etc. Des\nPlaces). He presents himself as returning to the teaching of Plato and\nthe early Academy. That teaching is in turn presented as deriving from\nPythagoras. Plato is described as \u201cnot better than the great\nPythagoras but perhaps not inferior to him either\u201d (Fr. 24 Des\nPlaces). Strikingly, Numenius presents Socrates too as a Pythagorean,\nwho worshipped the three Pythagorean gods recognized by Numenius (see\nbelow). Thus Plato derived his Pythagoreanism both from direct contact\nwith Pythagoreans and also from Socrates (Karamanolis 2006,\n129\u2013132). For Numenius a true philosopher adheres to the\nteaching of his master, and he wrote a polemical treatise, directed\nparticularly at the skeptical New Academy, with the title On the\nRevolution of the Academics against Plato (Fr. 24 Des Places).\nNumenius presents the Pythagorean philosophy to which Plato adhered as\nultimately based on a still earlier philosophy, which can be found in\nEastern thinkers such as the Magi, Brahmans, Egyptian priests and the\nHebrews (Fr. 1 Des Places). Thus, Numenius was reported to have asked\n\u201cWhat else is Plato than Moses speaking Greek?\u201d (Fr. 8 Des\nPlaces).\n\nNumenius presents his own doctrine of matter, which is clearly\ndeveloped out of Plato\u2019s Timaeus, as the work of\nPythagoras (Fr. 52 Des Places). Matter in its disorganized state is\nidentified with the indefinite dyad. Numenius argues that for\nPythagoras the dyad was a principle independent of the monad; later\nthinkers, who tried to derive the dyad from the monad (he does not\nname names but Eudorus, Moderatus and the Pythagorean system described\nby Alexander Polyhistor fit the description), were thus departing from\nthe original teaching. In emphasizing that the monad and dyad are\nindependent principles, Numenius is indeed closer to the Pythagorean\ntable of opposites described by Aristotle and to Plato\u2019s\nunwritten doctrines. Since it is in motion, disorganized matter must\nhave a soul, so that the world and the things in it have two souls,\none evil derived from matter and one good derived from reason.\nNumenius avoids complete dualism in that reason does have ultimate\ndominion over matter, thus making the world as good as possible, given\nthe existence of the recalcitrant matter.\n\nThe monad, which is opposed to the indefinite dyad, is just one of\nthree gods for Numenius (Fr. 11 Des Places), who here follows\nModeratus to a degree. The first god is equated with the good, is\nsimple, at rest and associates only with itself. The second god is the\ndemiurge, who by organizing matter divides himself so that a third god\narises, who is either identified with the organized cosmos or its\nanimating principle, the world soul (Dillon 1977, 366\u2013372).\nNumenius is famous for the striking images by means of which he\nelucidated his philosophy, such as the comparison of the helmsman, who\nsteers his ship by looking at the heavens, to the demiurge, who steers\nmatter by looking to the first god (Fr. 18 Des Places).\nNumenius\u2019 argument that there is a first god above the demiurge\nis paralleled by a passage in another treatise, which shows\nconnections to Neopythagorean metaphysics, The Chaldaean\nOracles (Majercik 1989), which were published by Julian the\nTheurgist, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161\u2013180 CE) and\nthus at about the same time as Numenius was active. It is hard to know\nwhich way the influence went (Dillon 1977, 363).\n\nIn The Refutation of all Heresies, the Christian bishop\nHippolytus (died ca. 235 CE) adopts the strategy of showing that\nChristian heresies are in fact based on the mistaken views of pagan\nphilosophers. Hippolytus spends considerable time describing\nPythagoreanism, since he regards it as the primary source for gnostic\nheresy (see Mansfeld 1992 for this and what follows).\nHippolytus\u2019 presentation of Pythagoreanism, which groups\ntogether Pythagoras, Plato, Empedocles and Heraclitus into a\nPythagorean succession, belongs to a family of Neopythagorean\ninterpretations of Pythagoreanism developed in the first century BCE\nand the first two centuries CE and which also appear in later\ncommentators such as Syrianus and Philoponus. Hippolytus\u2019\ninterpretation shows similarities to material in Eudorus, Philo\nJudaeus, Plutarch and Numenius among others, although he adapts the\nmaterial to fit his own purposes. He regards Platonism and\nPythagoreanism as the same philosophy, which ultimately derives from\nEgypt. Empedocles is regarded as a Pythagorean and is quoted,\nsometimes without attribution, as evidence for Pythagorean views.\nAccording to Hippolytus the Monad and the Dyad are the two Pythagorean\nprinciples, although the Dyad is derived from the Monad. The\nPythagoreans recognize two worlds, the intelligible, which has the\nMonad as its principle, and the sensible, whose principle is the\ntetraktys, the first four numbers, which correspond to the\npoint, line, surface and solid. The tetraktys contains the\ndecad, since the sum of 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 10, and this is embodied in\nthe ten Aristotelian categories, which describe the sensible world.\nThe pseudo-Archytan treatise,  The Whole System of\nCategories, had already claimed this Aristotelian doctrine for\nthe Pythagoreans (see 4.2 above). Finally, the intelligible world is\nequated with Empedocles\u2019 sphere controlled by the uniting power\nof Love in contrast to the world of sense perception in which the\ndividing power of Strife plays the role of the demiurge\n(Refutation of all Heresies 6, 23\u201325).\n4.4 Neopythagorean Mathematical Sciences: Nicomachus, Porphyry and Iamblichus\n\nA second strand of Neopythagoreanism, while maintaining connection to\nthese metaphysical speculations, emphasizes Pythagoras\u2019 role in\nthe mathematical sciences. Nicomachus of Gerasa (modern Jerash in\nJordan) was probably active a little before Numenius, in the first\nhalf of the second century CE. Unlike Neopythagoreans such as Eudorus,\nModeratus and Numenius, whose works only survive in fragments, two\ncomplete works of Nicomachus survive, Introduction to\nArithmetic and Handbook of Music. More than anyone else\nin antiquity he was responsible for popularizing supposed Pythagorean\nachievements in mathematics and the sciences. The Handbook of\nMusic gives the canonical but scientifically impossible story of\nPythagoras\u2019 discovery of the whole number ratios, which\ncorrespond to the basic concordant intervals in music: the octave\n(2:1), fifth (3:2), and fourth (4:3); he supposedly heard the concords\nin the sounds produced by hammers of varying weights in a\nblacksmith\u2019s shop, which he happened to be passing (Chapter 6\n\u2014 translation in Barker 1989, 256 ff.). In the next century,\nIamblichus took this chapter over virtually verbatim and without\nacknowledgement in his On the Pythagorean Life (Chapter 26)\nand it was repeated in many later authors. The harmonic theory\npresented by Nicomachus in the Handbook is not original and\nis, in fact, somewhat retrograde. It is tied to the diatonic scale\nused by Plato in the Timaeus (35b-36b), which was previously\nused by the Pythagorean Philolaus in the fifth-century (Fr. 6a) and\nshows no awareness of or interest in the more sophisticated analysis\nof Archytas in the fourth century BCE. Nicomachus is not concerned\nwith musical practice but with \u201cwhat pure reasoning can reveal\nabout the properties of a rationally impeccable and unalterable system\nof quantitative relations\u201d (Barker 2007, 447). Nicomachus also\nrelies heavily and without acknowledgement on a non-Pythagorean\ntreatment of music, Aristoxenus\u2019 Elementa Harmonica,\nmany of the ideas of which he assigns to the Pythagoreans (e.g., in\nChapter 2; see Barker 1989, 245 ff.).\n\nThe Handbook was influential because it put forth an\naccessible version of Pythagorean harmonics (Barker 2014,\n200\u2013202). Nicomachus provided a more detailed treatment of\nPythagorean harmonics in his lost Introduction to Music. Most\nscholars agree that Books I-III and perhaps Book IV of Boethius\u2019\nDe Institutione Musica are a close paraphrase, which is often\nessentially a translation, of Nicomachus\u2019 lost work (see Bower\nin Boethius 1989, xxviii and Barker 2007, 445). Even more influential\nthan his work on harmonics was Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to\nArithmetic. Again Nicomachus was not an original or particularly\ntalented mathematician, but this popularizing textbook was widely\ninfluential. There were a series of commentaries on it by Iamblichus\n(3rd CE), Asclepius of Tralles (6th CE), and Philoponus (6th CE) and\nit was translated into Latin already in the second half of the second\ncentury by Apuleius. Most importantly, Boethius (5th-6th CE) provides\nwhat is virtually a translation of it in his De Institutione\nArithmetica, which became the standard work on arithmetic in the\nmiddle ages. On Boethius\u2019 use of Nicomachus see Hicks 2014,\n422\u2013424.\n\nIn the Introduction to Arithmetic, Nicomachus assigns to\nPythagoras the Platonic division between the intelligible and sensible\nworld, quoting the Timaeus as if it were a Pythagorean text\n(I 2). He also assigns Aristotelian ideas to Pythagoras, in particular\na doctrine of immaterial attributes with similarities to the\nAristotelian categories (I 1). Nicomachus divides reality into two\nforms, magnitude and multitude. Wisdom is then knowledge of these two\nforms, which are studied by the four sciences, which will later be\nknown as the quadrivium: arithmetic, music, geometry and\nastronomy. He quotes a genuine fragment of Archytas (Fr. 1) in support\nof the special position of these four sciences. Nicomachus presents\narithmetic as the most important of the four, because it existed in\nthe mind of the creating god (the demiurge) as the plan which he\nfollowed in ordering the cosmos (I 4), so that numbers thus appear to\nhave replaced the Platonic forms as the model of creation (on forms\nand numbers in Nicomachus see Helmig 2007). It is striking that, along\nwith this Platonization of Pythagoreanism, Nicomachus does give an\naccurate presentation of Philolaus\u2019 basic metaphysical\nprinciples, limiters and unlimiteds, before attempting to equate them\nwith the Platonic monad and dyad (II 18).\n\nAnother work by Nicomachus, The Theology of Arithmetic, which\ncan be reconstructed from a summary by Photius and an anonymous work\nsometimes ascribed to Iamblichus and known as the Theologoumena\nArithmeticae (Dillon 1977, 352\u2013353), suggests that he\nlargely returned to the system of principles found in Plato\u2019s\nunwritten doctrines and did not follow Eudorus and Moderatus in\nattempts to place a supreme god above the demiurge. Nicomachus\napparently presents the monad as the first principle and demiurge,\nwhich then generates the dyad, but much is unclear (Dillon 1977,\n353\u2013358). The Theology of Arithmetic may have been most\ninfluential in its attempt to set up an equivalence between the pagan\ngods and the numbers in the decad, which was picked up later by\nIamblichus and Proclus (Kahn 2001, 116). Nicomachus also wrote a\nLife of Pythagoras, which has not survived but which Porphyry\n(e.g., VP 59) and Iamblichus used (Rohde 1871\u20131872;\nO\u2019Meara 2014, 412\u2013413).\n\nAfter Plotinus (205\u2013270 CE), Neopythagoreanism becomes absorbed\ninto Neoplatonism. Although Plotinus was clearly influenced by\nNeopythagorean speculation on first principles (see above), he was not\na Neopythagorean himself, in that he did not assign Pythagoras a\nprivileged place in the history of Greek philosophy. Plotinus treats\nPythagoras as just one among many predecessors, complains of the\nobscurities of his thought and labels Plato and not Pythagoras as\ndivine (Enneads IV 8.11 ff.).\n\nThe earliest extant Life of Pythagoras is that of Diogenes\nLaertius, who was active ca. 200 CE. The most recent treatment of\nDiogenes\u2019 life is Laks 2014, on which much of what follows\ndepends. Unlike his successors Porphyry and Iamblichus (see below)\nDiogenes had no philosophical affiliation and hence no philosophical\naxe to grind in presenting the life of Pythagoras. Indeed, it is\nstriking that his life shows little influence from the Neopythagorean\nauthors discussed above. Diogenes draws on a wide variety of important\nsources, some going back to the fourth century and others deriving\nfrom the Hellenistic period. This material is put together in a very\nloose, sometimes undetectable, organizational structure. There is a\nnotable section on Pythagoras\u2019 supposed writings (VIII,\n6\u20137). He shows particular interest in the Pythagorean way of\nlife and quotes a large number of Pythagorean symbola for\nsome of which his source was Aristotle (VIII 34\u201335). The main\nsection on Pythagoras\u2019 philosophical doctrines is a long\nquotation from the first-century polymath Alexander Polyhistor who\nclaims to be in turn drawing on a treatise called Pythagorean\nNotes (VIII 24\u201333). For more on this treatise see the\nsection on Pythagorean pseudepigrapha above (4.2). Diogenes quotes a\nnumber of passages satirizing Pythagoras, including Xenophanes\u2019\nfamous puppy fragment, and presents some of his own epigrams making\nfun of the Pythagorean way of life (VIII, 36). However, other parts of\nhis life present Pythagoras in a quite postive light so that it is\nhard to determine precisely what attitude Diogenes took towards\nPythagoras (Laks 2014, 377\u2013380).\n\nThe Life of Pythagoras by Plotinus\u2019 pupil and editor,\nPorphyry (234-ca. 305) is one of our most important sources for\nPythagoreanism (For what follows see Macris 2014). It was originally\npart of his now lost Philosophical History. Continuing\ninterest in Pythagoras in later centuries led the Life of\nPythagoras to be preserved separately and it is the only large\nsection of the Philosophical History to survive. The\nPhilosophical History  ended with Plato and clearly regarded\nPlatonic philosophy as the true philosophy so that Pythagoras seems to\nhave been highlighted as a key figure in the development of\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. Porphyry\u2019s Life of Pythagoras\nis particularly valuable, because he often clearly identifies his\nsources. This same penchant for identifying and seeking out important\nPythagorean sources can be seen in his commentary on Ptolemy\u2019s\nHarmonics (2nd CE), in which he preserves several genuine\nfragments of the early Pythagorean Archytas, along with some\npseudo-Pythagorean material. In the Life of Pythagoras\nPorphyry does not structure his information according to any\noverarching theme but instead sets out the information derived from\nother sources in a simple and orderly way with the minimum of\neditorial intervention. Although he cites some fifteen sources, some\ngoing back to the fourth century BCE, it is likely that he did not use\nmost of these sources but rather found them quoted in the four main\nsources, which he used directly: 1) Nicomachus\u2019 Life of\nPythagoras, 2) Moderatus\u2019 Lectures on\nPythagoreanism, 3) Antonius Diogenes\u2019 novel\nUnbelievable Things Beyond Thule, and 4) a handbook of some\nsort. Since these sources come from the first and second centuries CE,\nPorphyry basically provides us with the picture of Pythagoras common\nin Middle Platonism. This Pythagoras is the prototype of the sage of\nold who was active as a teacher and tied to religious mystery.\nHowever, he is not yet Iamblichus\u2019 priviliged soul sent to save\nhumanity (Macris, 2014, 390). Porphyry provides little criticism of\nhis sources and, although his life has a neutral factual tone, in\ncontrast to Diogenes Laertius in his Life of Pythagoras, he\nincludes no negative reports about Pythagoras.\n\nIt would appear, however, that Pythagoras was not made the source of\nall Greek philosophy, but was rather presented as one of a number of\nsages both Greek and non-Greek (e.g., Indians, Egyptians and Hebrews),\nwho promulgated a divinely revealed philosophy. This philosophy is, in\nfact, Platonic in origin as it relies on the Platonic distinction\nbetween the intelligible and sensible realms; Porphyry unhistorically\nassigns it back to these earlier thinkers, including Pythagoras.\nPythagoras\u2019 philosophy is thus said to aim at freeing the mind\nfrom the fetters of the body so that it can attain a vision of the\nintelligible and eternal beings (Life of Pythagoras\n46\u201347). O\u2019Meara thus seems correct to conclude that\nPorphyry was \u201c\u2026not a Pythagoreanizing Platonist \u2026\nbut rather a universalizing Platonist: he finds his Platonism both in\nPythagoras and in very many other quarters\u201d (1989, 25\u201329).\nPorphyry himself lived an ascetic life that was probably largely\ninspired by Pythagoreanism (Macris 2014, 393\u2013394).\n\nPorphyry\u2019s pupil, Iamblichus (ca. 245- ca. 325 CE), from Chalcis\nin Syria, opposed his teacher on many issues in Neoplatonic philosophy\nand was responsible for a systematic Pythagoreanization of\nNeoplatonism (see O\u2019 Meara 1989 and 2014), particularly under\nthe influence of Nicomachus\u2019 earlier treatment of Pythagorean\nwork in the quadrivium. Iamblichus wrote a work in ten books\nentitled On Pythagoreanism. The first four books have\nsurvived intact and excerpts of Books V-VII are preserved by the\nByzantine scholar Michael Psellus. Book One, On the Pythagorean\nLife, has biographical aspects but is primarily a detailed\ndescription of and a protreptic for the Pythagorean way of life. It\nmight be that Iamblichus\u2019 Pythagoras is intended in part as a\npagan rival to Christ and to Christianity, which was gaining strength\nat this time. Porphyry, indeed, had written a treatise Against the\nChristians, now lost. In Iamblichus, Pythagoras\u2019 miraculous\ndeeds include a meeting at the beginning of his career with fishermen\nhauling in a catch (VP 36; cf. Matthew 1. 16\u201320; see\nIamblichus, On the Pythagorean Life, Dillon and Hershbell\n(eds.) 1991, 25\u201326). O\u2019Meara, on the other hand, doubts\nthis connection to Christ (2014, 405 n. 21) and suggests that\nIamblichus may have constructed Pythagoras as a rival to\nPorphyry\u2019s presentation of Plotinus as the model philosopher\n(1989, 214\u2013215). In the end we cannot be certain whether\nIamblichus is responding to Porphyry or Porphyry to Iamblichus, but\nthey can be seen as battling over Plato\u2019s legacy (O\u2019Meara\n2014, 403). Porphyry in his Life of Plotinus and edition of\nhis works is promoting Plotinus\u2019 interpretation of Plato.\nIamblichus, on the other hand, advocates a return to the philosophy\nthat inspired Plato, Pythagoreanism. Pythagorean philosophy is\nportrayed by Iamblichus as a gift of the gods, which cannot be\ncomprehended without their aid; Pythagoras himself was sent down to\nmen to provide that aid (VP 1).\n\nIamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life is largely a\ncompilation of earlier sources but, unlike Porphyry, he does not\nusually identify them. Rohde (1871\u20131872) argued influentially\nthat  On the Pythagorean Life was largely a compilation from\ntwo sources: Nicomachus\u2019 Life of Pythagoras and a life\nof Pythagoras by Apollonius of Tyana. O\u2019Meara argues that this\nunderestimates both the extent to which Iamblichus reworked his\nsources for his own philosophical purposes and the variety of sources\nthat he used (O\u2019Meara 2014, 412\u2013415). A particularly clear\nexample of Iamblichus\u2019 distintive development of ideas found in\nearlier sources can be seen in his treatment of the doctrine of the\nharmony of the spheres (O\u2019Meara 2007). It is also true that the\nremaining books of On Pythgoreanism use a variety of sources.\nBook Two, Protreptic to Philosophy, is an exhortation to\nphilosophy in general and to Pythagorean philosophy in particular and\nrelies heavily on Aristotle\u2019s lost Protrepticus. Book\nThree, On General Mathematical Science, deals with the\ngeneral value of mathematics in aiding our comprehension of the\nintelligible realm and is followed by a series of books on the\nspecific sciences. The treatment of arithmetic in Book IV takes the\nform of a commentary on Nicomachus\u2019 Introduction to\nArithmetic. Books V-VII then dealt with arithmetic in physics,\nethics and theology respectively and were followed by treatments of\nthe other three sciences in the quadrivium: On Pythagorean\nGeometry, On Pythagorean Music and On Pythagorean\nAstronomy. Iamblichus was particularly interested in Pythagorean\nnumerology and his section on arithmetic in theology is probably\nreflected in the anonymous treatise which has survived under the title\nTheologoumena Arithmeticae and which has sometimes been\nascribed to Iamblichus himself. It appears that here again Iamblichus\nrelied heavily on Nicomachus, this time on his Theology of\nArithmetic.\n\nIt is possible that Iamblichus used the ten Books of On\nPythagoreanism as the basic text in his school, but we know that\nhe went beyond these books to the study of Aristotelian logic and the\nPlatonic dialogues, particularly the Timaeus and\nParmenides (Kahn 2001, 136\u2013137). Nonetheless, it was\nbecause of Iamblichus that Pythagoreanism in the form of numerology\nand mathematics in general was emphasized by later Neoplatonists such\nas Syrianus (fl. 430 CE) and Proclus (410/412\u2013485 CE). Proclus\nis reported to have dreamed that he was the reincarnation of\nNicomachus (Marinus, Life of Proclus 28). Proclus did treat\nPlato\u2019s writings as clearer than the somewhat obscure writings\nof the Pythagoreans but his Platonism is still heavily Pythagorean\n(O\u2019 Meara 2014, 415). The successors of Proclus appear to follow\nhis and Iamblichus\u2019 interpretation of Pythagoras (O\u2019Meara\n2013).\n4.5 Pythagoreans as Relgious Experts, Magicians and Moral Exemplars: Pythagoreanism in Rome, The Golden Verses and Apollonius of Tyana\n\nA third strand in Neopythagoreanism emphasizes Pythagoras\u2019\npractices rather than his supposed metaphysical system. This\nPythagoras is an expert in religious and magical practices and/or a\nsage who lived the ideal moral life, upon whom we should model our\nlives. This strand is closely connected to the striking interest in\nand prominence of Pythagoreanism in Roman literature during the first\ncentury BCE and first century CE. Cicero (106\u201343 BCE) in\nparticular refers to Pythagoras and other Pythagoreans with some\nfrequency. In De Finibus (V 2), he presents himself as the\nexcited tourist, who, upon his arrival in Metapontum in S. Italy and\neven before going to his lodgings, sought out the site where\nPythagoras was supposed to have died. At the beginning of Book IV\n(1\u20132) of the Tusculan Disputations, Cicero notes that\nPythagoras gained his fame in southern Italy at just the same time\nthat L. Brutus freed Rome from the tyranny of the kings and founded\nthe Republic; there is a clear implication that Pythagorean ideas,\nwhich reached Rome from southern Italy, had an influence on the early\nRoman Republic. Cicero goes on to assert explicitly that many Roman\nusages were derived from the Pythagoreans, although he does not give\nspecifics. According to Cicero, it was admiration for Pythagoras that\nled Romans to suppose, without noticing the chronological\nimpossibility, that the wisest of the early Roman kings, Numa, who was\nsupposed to have ruled from 715\u2013673 BCE, had been a pupil of\nPythagoras.\n\nIn addition to references to Pythagoras himself, Cicero refers to the\nPythagorean Archytas some eleven times, in particular emphasizing his\nhigh moral character, as revealed in his refusal to punish in anger\nand his suspicion of bodily pleasure (Rep. I 38. 59;\nSen. XII 39\u201341). Cicero\u2019s own philosophy is not\nmuch influenced by the Pythagoreans except in The Dream of\nScipio (Rep. VI 9), which owes even more to Plato.\n\nThe interest in Pythagoras and Pythagoreans in the first century BCE\nis not limited to Cicero, however. Both a famous ode of Horace (I 28)\nand a brief reference in Propertius (IV 1) present Archytas as a\nmaster astronomer. Most striking of all is the speech assigned to\nPythagoras that constitutes half of Book XV of Ovid\u2019s\nMetamorphoses (early years of the first century CE) and that\ncalls for strict vegetarianism in the context of the doctrine of\ntransmigration of souls. These latter themes are true to the earliest\nevidence for Pythagoras, but the rest of Ovid\u2019s presentation\nassigns to Pythagoras a doctrine that is derived from a number of\nearly Greek philosophers and in particular the doctrine of flux\nassociated with Heraclitus (Kahn 2001, 146\u2013149).\n\nThis flourishing of Pythagoreanism in Roman literature of the golden\nage has its roots in one of the earliest Roman literary figures,\nEnnius (239\u2013169 BCE), who, in his poem Annales, adopts\nthe Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis, in presenting himself as\nthe reincarnation of Homer, although he does not mention Pythagoras by\nname in the surviving fragments. Roman nationalism also played a role\nin the emphasis on Pythagoreanism at Rome. Since Pythagoras did his\nwork in Italy and Aristotle even referred to Pythagoreanism in some\nplaces as the philosophy of the Italians (e.g., Metaph.\n987a10), it is not surprising that the Romans wanted to emphasize\ntheir connections to Pythagoras. This is particularly clear in\nCicero\u2019s references to Pythagoreanism but once again finds its\nroots even earlier. In 343 BCE during the war with the Samnites,\nApollo ordered the Romans to erect one statue of the wisest and\nanother of the bravest of the Greeks; their choice for the former was\nPythagoras and for the latter Alcibiades. Pliny, who reports the story\n(Nat. XXXIV 26), expresses surprise that Socrates was not\nchosen for the former, given that, according to Plato\u2019s\nApology, Apollo himself had labeled Socrates the wisest; it\nis surely the Italian connection that explains the Romans\u2019\nchoice of Pythagoras. Cicero (not Aristoxenus as suggested by Horky\n2011) connects the great wisdom assigned to the Samnite Herrenius\nPontius to his contact with the Pythagorean Archytas (On Old\nAge 41). This Roman attempt to forge a connection with Pythagoras\ncan also be seen in the report of Plutarch (Aem. Paul. 1)\nthat some writers traced the descent of the Aemelii, one of\nRome\u2019s leading families, to Pythagoras, by claiming\nPythagoras\u2019 son Mamercus as the founder of the house.\n\nAlthough Rome\u2019s special connection to Pythagoras thus had\nearlier roots, those roots alone do not explain the efflorescence of\nPythagoreanism in golden age Latin literature; some stimulus probably\ncame from the rebirth of what were seen as Pythagorean practices in\nthe way certain people lived. The two most learned figures in Rome of\nthe first century BCE, Nigidius Figulus and Varro, both have\nconnections to Pythagorean ritual practices. Thus we are told that\nVarro (116\u201327 BCE) was buried according to the Pythagorean\nfashion in myrtle, olive and black poplar leaves (Pliny, Nat.\nXXXV 160). Amongst Varro\u2019s voluminous works was the\nHebdomad\u00eas (\u201cSevens\u201d), a\ncollection of 700 portraits of famous men, in the introduction to\nwhich Varro engaged in praise for the number 7, which is similar to\nthe numerology of later Neopythagorean works such as Nicomachus\u2019\nTheology of Arithmetic; in another work Varro presents a\ntheory of gestation, which has Pythagorean connections, in that it is\nbased on the whole number ratios that correspond to the concordant\nintervals in music (Rawson 1985, 161).\n\nIt is Nigidius Figulus, praetor in 58, who died in exile in 45,\nhowever, who is usually identified as the figure who was responsible\nfor reviving Pythagorean practices. In the preface to his translation\nof Plato\u2019s Timaeus, which is often treated as virtually\na Pythagorean treatise by the Neopythagoreans, Cicero asserts of\nNigidius that \u201cfollowing on those noble Pythagoreans, whose\nschool of philosophy had to a certain degree died out, \u2026 this\nman arose to revive it.\u201d Some scholars are dubious about this\nclaim of Cicero. They point to the evidence cited above for the\nimportance of Pythagoreanism in Rome in the two centuries before\nNigidius and suggest that Cicero may be illegitimately following\nAristoxenus\u2019 claim that Pythagoreanism died out in the first\nhalf of the fourth century (Riedweg 2005, 123\u2013124). While there\nmay be some evidence that there were practicing Pythagoreans in the\nsecond half of the fourth century (see above section 3.5), it is hard\nto find anyone to whom to apply that label in the third and second\ncenturies, so that, from the perspective of the evidence available to\nus at present, Cicero may well be right that Nigidius was the first\nperson in several centuries to claim to follow Pythagorean practices.\nHowever, the sources for Nigidius are meager and there is no evidence\nthat he was the leader of a large and powerful group. If there was an\norganized group at all, it is more likely to have been a smaller\ncircle (Flinterman 2014, 344).\n\nIt is difficult to be sure in what Nigidius\u2019 Pythagoreanism\nconsisted. There is no mention of Pythagoras or Pythagoreans in the\nsurviving fragments of his work nor do they show him engaging in\nPythagorean style numerology as Varro did (Rawson 1985, 291 ff.). In\nJerome\u2019s chronicle, Nigidius is labeled as Pythagorean and\nmagus; the most likely suggestion, thus, is that his\nPythagoreanism consisted in occult and magical practices. Pliny treats\nNigidius alongside the Magi and also presents Pythagoras and\nDemocritus as having learned magical practices from the Magi.\nCicero describes Nigidius as investgating matters that nature had\nhidden and this may be a reference to such magical lore (Flinterman\n2014, 345). Nigidius\u2019 expertise as an astrologer (he is reported\nto have used astrology to predict Augustus\u2019 future greatness on\nthe day of his birth [Suetonius, Aug. 94.5]) may be another\nPythagorean connection; Propertius\u2019 reference (IV 1) to Archytas\nshows that Pythagorean work in astronomy was typically connected to\nastrology in first century Rome.\n\nWhat led Nigidius and Varro to resurrect purported Pythagorean cult\npractices? One important influence may have been the Greek scholar\nAlexander Polyhistor, who was born in Miletus but was captured by the\nRomans during the Mithridatic wars and brought to Rome as a slave and\nfreed by Sulla in 80 BCE. He taught in Rome in the 70s. It is an\nintriguing suggestion that Nigidius learned his Pythagoreanism from\nAlexander (Dillon 1977, 117; For critiques of this suggestion see\nFlinterman 2014, 349\u2013350 and Long 2013, 145). There is no\nevidence that Alexander himself followed Pythagorean practices, but he\nwrote a book On Pythagorean Symbols, which was presumably an\naccount of the Pythagorean acusmata (or symbola),\nwhich set out the taboos that governed many aspects of the Pythagorean\nway of life. In addition, in his Successions of the\nPhilosophers, he gave a summary of Pythagorean philosophy, which\nhe supposedly found in the Pythagorean Notes (See section 4.2\nabove) and which has been preserved by Diogenes Laertius (VIII\n25\u201335). The basic principles assigned to Pythagoras are those of\nthe Neopythagorean tradition that begins in the early Academy, i.e.,\nthe monad and the indefinite dyad. Since Alexander also assigns to the\nPythagoreans the doctrine that the elements change into one another,\nwe might suppose that Ovid also used Alexander directly or indirectly,\nsince he assigns a similar doctrine to Pythagoras in the\nMetamorphoses (XV 75 ff., Rawson 1985, 294).\n\nIt is necessary to look in a slightly different direction, in order to\nsee how magical practices came to be particularly associated with\nPythagoras and thus why Nigidius was called Pythagorean and\nmagus. In the first century, it was widely believed that\nPythagoras had studied with the Magi (Cicero, Fin. V 87),\ni.e. Persian priests/wise men. What Pythagoras was thought to have\nlearned from the Magi most of all were the magical properties of\nplants. Pliny the elder (23\u201379 CE) identifies Pythagoras and\nDemocritus as the experts on such magic and the Magi as their teachers\n(Nat. XXIV 156\u2013160). Pliny goes on to give a number of\nspecific examples from a book on plants ascribed to Pythagoras. This\nbook is universally regarded as spurious by modern scholars, and even\nPliny, who accepts its authenticity, reports that some people ascribe\nit to Cleemporus. We can date this treatise on plants to the first\nhalf of the second century or earlier, since Cato the elder\n(234\u2013149 BCE) appears to make use of it in his On\nAgriculture (157), when he discusses the medicinal virtues of a\nkind of cabbage, which was named after Pythagoras (brassica\nPythagorea).\n\nA clearer understanding of this pseudo-Pythagorean treatise on plants\nand a further indication of its date can be obtained by looking at the\nwork of Bolus of Mendes, an Egyptian educated in Greek (see Dickie\n2001, 117\u2013122, to whom the following treatment of Bolus is\nindebted). Bolus composed a work entitled Cheiromecta, which\nmeans \u201cthings worked by hand\u201d and may thus refer to\npotions made by grinding plants and other substances (Dickie 2001,\n119). Bolus discussed not just the magical properties of plants but\nalso those of stones and animals. Pliny regarded the\nCheiromecta as composed by Democritus on the basis of his\nstudies with the Magi (Nat. 24. 160) and normally cites its\ncontents as what Democritus or the Magi said. Columella, however,\ntells us what was really going on (On Agriculture VII 5.17).\nThe work was in fact composed by Bolus, who published it under the\nname of Democritus. Bolus thus appears to have made a collection of\nmagical recipes, some of which do seem to have connections to the\nMagi, since they are similar to recipes found in 8th century cuneiform\ntexts (Dickie 2001, 121). In order to gain authority for this\ncollection, he assigned it to the famous Democritus.\n\nSince Democritus was sometimes regarded as the pupil of Pythagoreans\n(Diogenes Laertius IX 38), Bolus\u2019 choice of Democritus to give\nauthority to his work may suggest that someone else (the Cleemporus\nmentioned by Pliny?) had already used Pythagoras for this purpose and\nthat the pseudo-Pythagorean treatise on the magical properties of\nplants was thus already in existence when Bolus wrote, in the first\nhalf of the second century BCE. An example of the type of recipe\ninvolved is Pliny\u2019s ascription to Democritus of the idea that\nthe tongue of a frog, cut out while the frog was still alive, if\nplaced above the heart of a sleeping woman, will cause her to give\ntrue answers (Nat. XXXII 49). Thus, the picture of Pythagoras\nthe magician, which may lie behind a number of the supposed\nPythagorean practices of Nigidius Figulus, is based on little more\nthan the tradition that Pythagoras had traveled to Egypt and the east,\nso that he became the authority figure, to whom the real collectors of\nmagical recipes in the third and second century BCE ascribed their\ncollections.\n\nNigidius\u2019 revival of supposed Pythagorean practices spread to\nother figures in first century Rome. Cicero attacked Vatinius, consul\nin 48 and a supporter of Caesar, for calling himself a Pythagorean and\ntrying to shield his scandalous practices under the name of Pythagoras\n(Vat. 6). The scandalous practices involved necromancy,\ninvoking the dead, by murdering young boys. Presumably this method of\nnecromancy would not be ascribed to Pythagoras, but the suggestion is\nthat some methods of consulting the dead were regarded as Pythagorean.\nCicero later ended up defending this same Vatinius in a speech which\nhas not survived but some of the contents of which we know from the\nancient scholia on the speech against Vatinius. In this speech Cicero\ndefended Vatinius\u2019 habit of wearing a black toga, which he\nattacked in the earlier speech (Vat. 12), as a harmless\naffectation of Pythagoreanism (Dickie 2001, 170). Thus, the title of\nPythagorean in first century Rome carried with it associations with\nmagical practices, not all of which would have been widely approved.\n\n\nAnother example of the connection between Pythagoreanism and magic and\nits possible negative connotations is Anaxilaus of Larissa (Rawson\n1985, 293; Dickie 2001, 172\u2013173). In his chronicle, Jerome\ndescribes him with the same words as he used for Nigidius, Pythagorean\nand magus, and reports that he was exiled from Rome in 28\nBCE. We know that Anaxilaus wrote a work entitled Paignia\n(\u201ctricks\u201d), which seems to have consisted of some rather\nbizarre conjuring tricks for parties. Pliny reports one of\nAnaxilaus\u2019 tricks as calling for burning the discharge from a\nmare in heat in a flame, in order to cause the guests to see images of\nhorses\u2019 heads (Nat. XXVIII 181). The passion for things\nPythagorean can also be seen in the figure of king Juba of Mauretania\n(ca. 46 BCE \u2013 23 CE), a learned and cultured man, educated at\nRome and author of many books. Olympiodorus describes him as \u201ca\nlover of Pythagorean compositions\u201d and suggests that Pythagorean\nbooks were forged to satisfy the passion of collectors such as Juba\n(Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca 12.1, p. 13).\n\nThe connection between Pythagoreanism and astrology visible in\nNigidius can perhaps also be seen in Thrasyllus of Alexandria (d. 36\nCE), the court astrologer and philosopher, whom the Roman emperor\nTiberius met in Rhodes and brought to Rome. Thrasyllus is famous for\nhis edition of Plato\u2019s dialogues arranged into tetralogies, but\nhe was a Platonist with strong Pythagorean leanings. Porphyry in his\nLife of Plotinus (20) quotes Longinus as saying that\nThrasyllus wrote on Platonic and Pythagorean first principles (Dillon\n1977, 184\u2013185). Most suggestive of all is the quotation from\nThrasyllus preserved by Diogenes Laertius (Diogenes Laertius IX 38),\nin which Thrasyllus calls Democritus a zealous follower of the\nPythagoreans and asserts that Democritus drew all his philosophy from\nPythagoras and would have been thought to have been his pupil, if\nchronology did not prevent it. It is impossible to be sure what\nThrasyllus had in mind here, but one very plausible suggestion is that\nhe is thinking of Democritus as a sage, who practiced magic, the\nDemocritus created by Bolus, who was the successor to the arch mage\nPythagoras, the supposed author of the treatise on the magical uses of\nplants (Dickie 2001, 195). Some have argued that the subterranean\nbasilica discovered near the Porta Maggiore and dating to the first\ncentury CE was the meeting place of a Pythagorean community but the\nevidence for this suggestion is very weak (Flinterman 2014).\n\nWe cannot be sure whether the Pythagoreanism of Nigidius, Varro and\ntheir successors was limited to such things as burial ritual, magical\npractices and black togas or whether it extended to less spectacular\nfeatures of a \u201cPythagorean\u201d life. Q. Sextius, however,\nfounded a philosophical movement in the time of Augustus, which\nprescribed a vegetarian diet and taught the doctrine of transmigration\nof souls, although Sextius presented himself as using different\narguments than Pythagoras for vegetarianism (Seneca, Ep. 108.\n17 ff.). One of these Sextians, as they were known, was Sotion, the\nteacher of Seneca, and it is Seneca who gives us most of the\ninformation we have about them. It is also noteworthy that Sextius is\nalso reported to have asked himself at the end of each day \u201cWhat\nbad habit have you cured today? What vice have you resisted? In what\nway are you better\u201d (Seneca, De Ira III 36). Cicero\ntells us that it was \u201cthe Pythagorean custom\u201d to call to\nmind in the evening everything said, heard or done during the day\n(Sen. 38, cf. Iamblichus, VP 164). The practice\ndescribed by Cicero is directed at training the memory in contrast to\nSextius\u2019 questions, which call for moral self-examination. On\nPythagoreanism in Rome see further Flinterman 2014.\n\nSomething similar to the Sextian version of the practice is found in\nlines 40\u201344 of the Golden Verses, a pseudepigraphical\ntreatise consisting of 71 Greek hexameter verses, which were ascribed\nto Pythagoras or the Pythagoreans. The poem is a combination of\nmaterials from different dates, and it is uncertain when it took the\nform preserved in manuscripts and called the Golden Verses;\ndates ranging from 350 BCE to 400 CE have been suggested (see Thom\n1995). It is not referred to by name until 200 CE. The Golden\nVerses are frequently quoted in the first centuries CE and thus\nconstitute one model of the Pythagorean life in Neopythagoreanism, one\nthat is free from magical practices. Much of the advice is common to\nall of Greek ethical thought (e.g., honoring the gods and parents;\nmastering lust and anger; deliberating before acting, following\nmeasure in all things), but there are also mentions of dietary\nrestrictions typical of early Pythagoreanism and the promise of\nleaving the body behind to join the aither as an immortal.\n\nOur most detailed account of a Neopythagorean living a life inspired\nby Pythagoras is Philostratus\u2019 Life of Apollonius of\nTyana. Apollonius was active in the second half of the first\ncentury CE and died in 97; Philostratus\u2019 life, which was written\nover a century later at the request of the empress Julia Domna and\ncompleted after her death in 217 CE, is more novel than sober\nbiography. According to Philostratus, Apollonius identified his wisdom\nas that of Pythagoras, who taught him the proper way to worship the\ngods, to wear linen rather than wool, to wear his hair long, and to\neat no animal food (I 32). Some have wondered if Apollonius\u2019\nPythagoreanism is largely the creation of Philostratus, but the\nstandard view has been that Apollonius wrote a life of Pythagoras used\nby Iamblichus (VP 254) and Porphyry (Burkert 1972, 100), and\nthe fragment of his treatise On Sacrifices has clear\nconnections to Neopythagorean philosophy (Kahn 2001, 143\u2013145).\nRohde thought that large parts of Apollonius\u2019s Life of\nPythagoras could be found in Iamblichus\u2019 On the\nPythagorean Life, but recently more and more doubt has arisen as\nto whether the Apollonius who wrote the Life of Pythagoras\nused by Iamblichus is really Apollonius of Tyana (Flinterman 2014,\n357). \n\nLike Pythagoras, Apollonius journeys to consult the wise men of the\neast and learns from the Brahmins in India that the doctrine of\ntransmigration, which Apollonius inherited from Pythagoras, originated\nin India and was handed on to the Egyptians from whom Pythagoras\nderived it (III 19). Philostratus (I 2) emphasizes that Apollonius was\nnot a magician, thus trying to free him from the more disreputable\nconnotations of Pythagorean practices associated with figures such as\nAnaxilaus and Vatinius (see above). Nonetheless, Philostratus\u2019\nlife does recount a number of Apollonius\u2019 miracles, such as the\nraising of a girl from the dead (IV 45). On Apollonius as a\nPythagorean see further Flinterman 2014.\n\nThese miracles made Apollonius into a pagan counterpart to Christ. The\nemperor Alexander Severus (222\u2013235 CE) worshipped Apollonius\nalongside Christ, Abraham and Orpheus (Hist. Aug., Vita Alex.\nSev. 29.2). Hierocles, the Roman governor of Bithynia, who was\nrigorous in his persecution of Christians, championed Apollonius at\nthe expense of Christ, in The Lover of Truth, and drew as a\nresponse Eusebius\u2019 Against Hierocles. As mentioned\nabove, there is some probability that Iamblichus intends to elevate\nPythagoras himself as a pagan counterpart to Christ in his On the\nPythagorean Life (Dillon and Hershbell 1991, 25\u201326).\n\nThe satirist Lucian (2nd CE) provides us with a hostile portrayal of\nanother holy man with Pythagorean connections, Alexander of\nAbnoteichus in Paphlagonia, who was active in the middle of the second\ncentury CE. In Alexander the False Prophet, Lucian reports\nthat Alexander compared himself to Pythagoras (4), could remember his\nprevious incarnations (34) and had a golden thigh like Pythagoras\n(40). Lucian shows the not often seen negative side to both\nPythagoras\u2019 and Alexander\u2019s reputations when he reports\nthat, if one took even the worst things said about Pythagoras,\nAlexander would far outdo him in wickedness (4). Some have seen\nAlexander as largely a literary construction by Lucian with little\nhistorical basis but other evidence confirms that there were traveling\nPythagorean wonder-workers in the early imperial period (Flinterman\n2014, 359). \n\nDespite these attacks on figures such as Apollonius and Alexander who\nmodeled themselves on Pythagoras, the Pythagorean way of life was in\ngeneral praised; the Neopythagorean tradition which portrays\nPythagoras as living the ideal life on which we should model our own\nreaches its culmination in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean\nLife and Porphyry\u2019s Life of Pythagoras\n5. Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance\n\nThe influence of Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages and Renaissance was\nextensive and was found in most disciplines, in literature and art as\nwell as in philosophy and science. Here only the highlights of that\ninfluence can be given (see further Heninger 1974, Celenza 1999,\nCelenza 2001, Kahn 2001, Riedweg 2005, Hicks 2014 and Allen 2014, to\nall of whom the following account is indebted). It is crucial to\nrecognize from the beginning that the Pythagoras of the Middle Ages\nand Renaissance is the Pythagoras of the Neopythagorean tradition, in\nwhich he is regarded as either the most important or one of the most\nimportant philosophers in the Greek philosophical tradition. Thus,\nRalph Cudworth, in The True Intellectual System of the\nUniverse asserted that \u201cPythagoras was the most eminent of\nall the ancient Philosophers\u201d (1845, II 4). This is a far cry\nfrom the Pythagoras that can be reconstructed by responsible\nscholarship. Riedweg has put it well: \u201cHad Pythagoras and his\nteachings not been since the early Academy overwritten with\nPlato\u2019s philosophy, and had this \u2018palimpsest\u2019 not in\nthe course of the Roman empire achieved unchallenged authority among\nPlatonists, it would be scarcely conceivable that scholars from the\nMiddle Ages and modernity down to the present would have found the\npre-Socratic charismatic from Samos so fascinating\u201d (2005,\n128).\n5.1 Boethius/Nicomachus, Calcidius, Macrobius and the Middle Ages\n\nIn the Middle Ages Pythagoras and Pythagorean philosophy were regarded\nas the height of Greek philosophical achievement, although, somewhat\nparadoxically Pythagoreanism was not still an active philosophy as\nwere Platonism and Aristotelianism but instead belonged to an\n\u201cimagined history\u201d of philosophy (Hicks 2014, 420). The\nview of Pythagoreanism in the Middle Ages was heavily determined by\nthree late ancient Latin writers: Calcidius, Macrobius and Boethius.\nIt was in particular the mathematical Pythagoreanism of Nicomachus as\ntransmitted by Boethius that determined the medieval picture of\nPythagoras. In ethics, Christians were able to embrace some\nPythagorean maxims such as the principle labeled Pythagorean by\nBoethius: \u201cFollow God\u201d (Consolation of Philosophy\n1.4). Some attention was also paid to other Pythagorean\nsymbola (see section 5.2 below). On the other hand the\ndoctrine of metempsychosis with its idea that human beings were born\nagain as animals was repugnant to Christian doctrine (John of\nSalisbury, Policraticus 7.10). When it comes to\nPythagoras\u2019 life it is crucial to recognize that\nIamblichus\u2019 and Porphyry\u2019s lives of Pythagoras were not\nknown in the Middle Ages so that Pythagoras\u2019 activities were\nmostly known through passages from classical authors and church\nfathers (Hicks 2014, 421). Pythagoras was included in medieval\nencyclopedic works and was given particularly thorough treatment by\nVincent of Beauvais (before 1200\u20131264) in his Speculum\nhistoriale (3.24\u201326), by John of Wales (fl.\n1260\u20131283) in Compendiloquium (3.6.2) and in The\nLives and Habits of the Philosophers ascribed to, but probably\nnot actually composed by, Walter Burley (1275\u20131344; see Riedweg\n2005, 129; Heninger 1974, 47; Hicks 2014, 421). \n\nThe most influential texts for the conception of Pythagoras in the\nLatin Middle Ages and early Renaissance were Boethius\u2019\n(480\u2013524 CE) De Institutione Arithmetica and De\nInstitutione Musica, which are virtually translations of the\nNeopythagorean Nicomachus\u2019 (second century CE) Introduction\nto Arithmetic and Introduction to Music (this larger\nwork is now lost, but a smaller Handbook of Harmonics\nsurvives). Boethius followed Nicomachus\u2019 classification of four\nmathematical sciences depending on the nature of their objects\n(arithmetic deals with multitude in itself, music with relative\nmultitude, geometry with unmoving magnitudes and astronomy with\nmagnitude in motion). Boethius introduced the term\nquadrivium, \u201cfourfold road\u201d to understanding, to\nrefer to these four sciences. In music theory, Boethius presents the\nPythagoreans as taking a middle position, which gives a role in\nharmonics to both reason and perception. His presentation of the\nPythagorean position was central to music theory for over a thousand\nyears (Hicks 2014, 424). Boethius recounts the apocryphal story of\nPythagoras\u2019 discovery in a blacksmith\u2019s shop of the ratios\nthat govern the concordant intervals (Mus. I 10). \n\nThe medieval picture of Pythagoras as a natural philosopher and the\nmedieval understanding of his theory of the nature of the soul were\nheavily influenced by the Latin commentary on Plato\u2019s\nTimaeus by Calcidius (4th century CE) and the Commentary\non the Dream of Scipio by Macrobius (5th century CE). Calcidius\nregarded Plato\u2019s Timaeus as a heavily Pythagorean\ndocument. Under the influence of the Neopythagorean Numenius,\nCalcidius assigned to Pythagoras the view that god was unity and\nmatter duality (Hicks 2014, 429). Calcidius describes Plato\u2019s\nWorld-Soul in a way that highlights its harmonic structure and\nMacrobius explicitly ascribes to Pythagoras the view that the soul is\na harmony (Commentary on the Dream of Scipio 1.14.19). The\ndoctrine of the harmony of the spheres, which portrays the cosmos as a\nharmony that is expressed in the music made by the revolutions of the\nplanets, follows from the numerical structure of the World-Soul and\nwas also assigned to Pythagoras by Calcidius. Most medieval\nNeoplatonic cosmoligies adopted the doctrine, but the reintroduction\nof Aristotle\u2019s criticism of it in the thirteenth century caused\nmany to abandon the theory until it was revived in the Renaissance by\nFicino (Hicks 2014, 434). Later, Shakespeare refers to the doctrine\nmemorably in The Merchant of Venice (V i. 54\u201365).\nCicero\u2019s presentation of it in the Dream of Scipio was\nalso influential in the Renaissance (Heninger 1974, 3).\n\nPythagorean influence also appeared at less elevated levels of\nmedieval culture. A fourteenth-century manual for preachers, which\ncontained lore about the natural world and is known as The Light\nof the Soul, ascribes a series of odd observations about nature\nto Archita Tharentinus, who is presumably intended to be the fourth\ncentury BCE Pythagorean, Archytas of Tarentum. These are mostly cited\nfrom a book, which was evidently forged in Archytas\u2019 name and\nknown as On Events in Nature. Some of the observations are\nplausible enough, e.g., that a person at the bottom of a well sees\nstars in the middle of the day, others more puzzling, e.g., that a\ndying man emits fiery rays from his eyes at death, while still others\nmay have connections to magic, e.g., \u201cif someone looks at a\nmirror, before which a white flower has been placed, he cries.\u201d\nSome magical lore ascribed to an Architas is also found in the\nthirteenth-century Marvels of the World (ps.-Albertus\nMagnus), e.g., \u201cif the wax of the left ear of a dog be taken and\nhung on people with periodic fever, it is beneficial\u2026\u201d\nThese texts seem to continue the connection between Pythagoreanism and\nmagic, which developed in the third and second centuries BCE, and is\nprominent in Rome during the first-century BCE (see above section\n4.5).\n5.2 The Renaissance: Ficino, Pico, Reuchlin, Copernicus and Kepler\n\nIn the Renaissance, Pythagoreanism played an important role in the\nthought of fifteenth- and sixteenth century Italian and German\nhumanists. The Florentine Marsilio Ficino (1433\u20131499) is most\nproperly described as a Neoplatonist. He made the philosophy of Plato\navailable to the Latin-speaking west through his translation of all of\nPlato into Latin. In addition he translated important works of writers\nin the Neoplatonic and Neopythagorean tradition, such as Plotinus,\nPorphyry, Iamblichus and Proclus. From that tradition he accepted and\ndeveloped the view that Plato was heir to an ancient\ntheology/philosophy (prisca theologia) that was derived from\nearlier sages including Pythagoras, who immediately preceded Plato in\nthe succession (Allen 2014, 435\u2013436). Ficino like the\nNeopythagoreans had no conception of an early and a late\nPythagoreanism, for him Pythagoreanism was a unity as indeed was the\nentire tradition of ancient theology (Celenza, 1999, 675\u2013681).\nFicino regarded works ascribed to the Chaldaean Zoroaster, the\nEgyptian Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus and Pythagoras, which modern\nscholarship has shown to be forgeries of late antiquity, as genuine\nworks on which Plato drew (Kristeller 1979, 131). Ficino provided a\ncomplete translation of the writings ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus\ninto Latin as well as translations of 39 of the short Pythagorean\nsayings known as symbola, many of which are ancient, and\nHierocles\u2019 commentary on the pseudo-Pythagorean Golden\nVerses (Heninger 1974, 63 and 66). The Golden Verses\n(see Thom 1995) were, in fact, one of the most popular Greek texts in\nthe Renaissance and were commonly used in textbooks for learning\nGreek; other pseudo-Pythagorean texts, such as the treatises ascribed\nto Timaeus of Locri and Ocellus, were translated early and regarded as\ngenuine texts on which Plato drew (Heninger 1974, 49, 55\u201356).\nFicino thought, moreover, that this whole pagan tradition could be\nreconciled with Christian and Jewish religion and accepted the view\nthat Pythagoras was born of a Jewish father (Heninger 1974, 201). For\nFicino and the Renaissance as a whole, Pythagoras was the most\nimportant of the Presocratic philosophers but he never overshadowed\nPlato, who was the highest authority, in part because there was no\nextensive body of texts by Pythagoras himself to compete with the\nPlatonic dialogues (Allen 2014, 453).\n\nFicino translated Iamblichus\u2019 four works on Pythagoreanism for\nhis own use and Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life had\nparticular influence on him. Ficino felt that in his time there was a\nneed for a divinely inspired guide on earth and fashioned himself as\nsuch a prophet under the influence of Iamblichus\u2019 presentation\nof Pythagoras as a divine guide sent by the gods to save mankind\n(Celenza 1999, 667\u2013674). The Pythagorean musical practice that\nhe found in Iamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life , with\nits emphasis on the impact of music on the soul, shaped his own music\nmaking and his presentation of himself as a Pythagorean and Orphic\nholy man (Allen 2014, 436\u2013440). Ficino and other Renaissance\nthinkers grappled with the challenge that the Pythagorean notion of\nmetempsychosis presented to Christiantiy and how it might be\nreconciled with Christian views (Allen 2014, 440\u2013446). Ficino\nwas eager to absolve Plato from such a heresy. He does this in part by\ntreating metempsychosis metaphorically as referring to the\nsoul\u2019s ability to remake itself, but he also emphasized that\nmetempsychosis was not present in Plato\u2019s latest work,\nLaws, and made the Pythagoreans scapegoats by suggesting that\nother passages in Plato refer not to Plato\u2019s own doctrines but\nthe Pythagoreans (Celenza 1999, 681\u2013691). Ficino saw his own\narithmology as Pythgorean and study of Neopythagorean mathematical\ntreatises by Nicomachus and Theon led Ficino to conclude that\nPlato\u2019s nuptial number in Book 8 of the Republic was 12\n(Allen 2014, 446\u2013450). He also mistakenly and paradoxically\nfollowed the Neopythagoreans in thinking that the Pythagoreans\noccupied the crucial position in the history of philosophy of the\nfirst philosophers to distinguish between the corporeal and\nincorporeal and to assert the superiority of the latter, an\nachievement that is more reasonably assigned to Ficino\u2019s hero\nPlato (Celenza 1999, 699\u2013706). \n\nThe Pythagorean symbola were important to Ficino and the\nRenaissance. They had already been interpreted as moral maxims by the\nearly church fathers (e.g., Clement, Origen and Ambrose). Ambrose, for\nexample, interpreted the Pythagorean \u201cdo not take the public\npath\u201d to mean that priests should live lives of exceptional\npurity (Ep. 81). Jerome discussed 13 symbola in his\nEpistle Against Rufinus and this list became the basis for\nmedieval discussions of the symbola in texts such as the\nSpeculum historiale of Vincent of Beauvais and the Lives\nand Habits of the Philosophers  of Walter Burley (Celenza 2001,\n11\u201312). Ficino particularly encountered them in\nIamblichus\u2019 On the Pythagorean Life and\nProtrepticus. For Ficino, their brevity was appropriate to\nrevealing the supreme reality, since he argued that the closer the\nmind approaches to the One the fewer words it needs (Allen 2014,\n450\u2013451). In addition, he found them relevant to the preparation\nand purification of the soul (Celenza, 1999, 693). They were widely\ndiscussed by Ficino\u2019s contemporaries and successors (Celenza\n2001, 52\u201381). Some figures wrote treatises devoted to their\ninterpretation (Ficino\u2019s mentor Antonio degli Agli, his follower\nGiovanni Nesi [for an edition of Nesi\u2019s work see Celenza 2001],\nFilippo Beroaldo the Elder and Lilio Gregorio Giraldi), while others\ndiscussed them as part of larger works (Erasmus and Reuchlin). Not\neveryone took the symbola seriously; Angelo Poliziano, the\ngreat Florentine philologist and professor, presents a satire on them\nin the fashion of Lucian, joking about Pythagoras\u2019 ability to\ntalk to animals and ridiculing the prohibition on beans (Celenza 2001,\n33).\n\nFicino\u2019s friend and younger contemporary, Giovanni Pico della\nMirandola (1463\u20131494), advanced an even more radical doctrine of\nuniversal truth, according to which all philosophies had a share of\ntruth and could be reconciled in a comprehensive philosophy\n(Kristeller 1979, 205). His Oration on the Dignity of Man\nshows the variety of ways in which he was influenced by the\nPythagorean tradition. He equates the friendship that the Pythagoreans\nsaw as the goal of philosophy (see, e.g., Iamblichus, VP 229)\nwith the peace that the angels announced to men of good will (1965,\n11\u201312); the Pythagorean symbola forbidding urinating\ntowards the sun or cutting the nails during sacrifice are interpreted\nallegorically as calling on us to relieve ourselves of excessive\nappetite for sensual pleasures and to trim the pricks of anger (1965,\n15); the practice of philosophizing through numbers is assigned to\nPythagoras along with Philolaus, Plato and the early Platonists (1965,\n25\u201326); Pythagoras is said to have modeled his philosophy on the\nOrphic theology (1965, 33). Finally, on the basis of the\npseudo-Pythagorean letter of Lysis to Hipparchus, Pythagoras is said\nto have kept silent about his doctrine and left just a few things in\nwriting to his daughter at his death. In observing such silence,\nPythagoras is portrayed as following an earlier practice symbolized by\nthe sphinx in Egypt and most of all by Moses, who indeed published the\nlaw to men but supposedly kept the interpretation of that law a\nsecret. Pico equates this secret interpretation of the law with the\nCabala, an esoteric doctrine in which the words and numbers of Hebrew\nscripture are interpreted according to a mystical system (1965, 30;\nsee also Heptaplus 1965, 68).\n\nPico\u2019s interest in reconciling the Cabala with Christianity and\nthe pagan philosophical tradition, including Pythagoreanism, was\nfurther developed by the German humanist, Johannes Reuchlin\n(1445\u20131522). In the dedicatory letter for his Three\nBooks On the Art of the Cabala (1517), which was\naddressed to Pope Leo X, Reuchlin says that as Ficino has restored\nPlato for Italy so he will \u201coffer to the Germans Pythagoras\nreborn,\u201d although he cannot \u201cdo this without the cabala of\nthe Hebrews, because the philosophy of Pythagoras took its beginning\nfrom the precepts of the cabalists\u201d (tr. Heninger 1974, 245).\nThus, in an earlier work (De verbo mirifico) he had equated\nthe four consonants in the Hebrew name for God, JHVH, with the\nPythagorean tetraktys, and gave to each of the letters, which\nare equated with numbers as in Greek practice, a mystical meaning. The\nfirst H, which also stands for the number five that the Pythagoreans\nequated with marriage, is thus taken to symbolize the marriage of the\ntrinity with material nature, which was equated with the dyad by the\nNeopythagoreans (Riedweg 2005, 130).\n\nAt the level of popular culture, several fortune-telling devices were\ntied to Pythagoras, the most famous of which went under the name of\nthe Wheel of Pythagoras (Heninger 1974, 237). Pythagoras was probably\nmost widely known, however, through Ovid\u2019s presentation of him\nat the beginning of Book XV of the Metamorphoses, which was\nimmensely popular in the Renaissance (Heninger 1974, 50). Ovid\nrecounts the story, which had already been recognized as apocryphal by\nCicero (Tusc. IV 1), that the second Roman king, Numa,\nstudied with Pythagoras. Pythagoras is presented inaccurately by Ovid\nas a great natural philosopher, who discovered the secrets of the\nuniverse and who believed in a doctrine of the flux of four elements.\nOn the other hand, Ovid\u2019s emphasis on the prohibition on eating\nanimal flesh and on the immortality of the soul have some connection\nto the historical Pythagoras. In the Renaissance, Pythagoras was not\nprimarily known for the \u201cPythagorean Theorem,\u201d as he is\ntoday. Better known was the doubtful anecdote (Burkert 1960, Riedweg\n2005, 90\u201397), going back ultimately to Heraclides of Pontus but\nknown to the Renaissance mainly through Cicero (Tusc. V\n3\u20134), that he was the first to coin the word\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d (Heninger 1974, 29).\n\nIn the sixteenth century, Pythagorean influence was particularly\nimportant in the development of astronomy. The Polish astronomer\nCopernicus (1473\u20131543), in the Preface and Dedication to\nPope Paul III attached to his epoch making work, On the\nRevolution of the Heavenly Spheres, reports that, in his\ndissatisfaction with the commonly accepted geocentric astronomical\nsystem of Ptolemy (2nd century CE), he laboriously reread the works of\nall the philosophers to see if any had ever proposed a different\nsystem. This labor led him to find inspiration not from Pythagoras\nhimself but rather from later Pythagoreans and in particular from\nPhilolaus. Copernicus found in Cicero (Ac. II 39. 123) that\nthe Pythagorean Hicetas (4th century BCE \u2014 Copernicus mistakenly\ncalls him Nicetas) had proposed that the earth revolved around its\naxis at the center of the universe and in pseudo-Plutarch (Diels 1958,\n378) that another Pythagorean, Ecphantus, and Heraclides of Pontus\n(both 4th century BCE), whom Copernicus regarded as a Pythagorean, had\nproposed a similar view. More importantly, he also found in\npseudo-Plutarch that the Pythagorean, Philolaus of Croton (5th century\nBCE), \u201cheld that the earth moved in a circle \u2026 and was\none of the planets\u201d (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly\nSpheres 1. 5, tr. Wallis).\n\nCopernicus reports to the Pope that he was led by these earlier\nthinkers \u201cto meditate on the mobility of the earth.\u201d\nPythagorean influence on Copernicus was not limited to the notion of a\nmoving earth. In the same preface he explains his hesitation to\npublish his book in light of the pseudo-Pythagorean letter of Lysis to\nHipparchus, which recounts the supposed reluctance of the Pythagoreans\nto divulge their views to the common run of people, who had not\ndevoted themselves to study (for further Pythagorean influences on\nCopernicus see Kahn 2001, 159\u2013161). A number of the followers of\nCopernicus saw him as primarily reviving the ancient Pythagorean\nsystem rather than presenting anything new (Heninger 1974, 130 and\n144, n. 131); Edward Sherburne reflects the common view of the late\n17th century in referring to the heliocentric system as \u201cthe\nsystem of Philolaus and Copernicus\u201d (Heninger 1974,\n129\u2013130), although in the Philolaic system it is, in fact, a\ncentral fire and not the sun that is at the center of the\nuniverse.\n\nThe last great Pythagorean was Johannes Kepler (1571\u20131630\n\u2014 see Kahn 2001, 161\u2013172 for a good brief account of\nKepler\u2019s Pythagoreanism). Kepler began by developing the\nCopernican system in light of the five regular solids (tetrahedron,\ncube, octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron), to which Plato\nappealed in his construction of matter in the Timaeus (see\nespecially 53B-55C). He followed the Renaissance practice illustrated\nabove of regarding Greek philosophy as closely connected to the wisdom\nof the Near East, when he asserted that the Timaeus was a\ncommentary on the first chapter of Genesis (Kahn 2001, 162).\nIn the preface to his early work, Mysterium Cosmographicum\n(1596), Kepler says that his purpose is to show that God used the five\nregular bodies, \u201cwhich have been most celebrated from the time\nof Pythagoras and Plato,\u201d as his model in constructing the\nuniverse and that \u201che accommodated the number of heavenly\nspheres, their proportions, and the system of their motions\u201d to\nthese five regular solids (tr. Heninger 1974, 110\u2013111).\n\nIn ascribing geometrical knowledge of the five regular solids to\nPythagoras, Kepler is following an erroneous Neopythagorean tradition,\nalthough the dodecahedron may have served as an early Pythagorean\nsymbol (see on Hippasus in section 3.4 above and Burkert 1972,\n70\u201371, 404, 460). Thus, this aspect of Kepler\u2019s work is\nmore Platonic than Pythagorean. The five solids were conceived of as\ncircumscribing and inscribed in the spheres of the orbits of the\nplanets, so that the five solids corresponded to the six planets known\nto Kepler (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Earth, Venus, Mercury). There were\nsix planets, because there were precisely five regular bodies to be\nused in constructing the universe, corresponding to the five intervals\nbetween the planets. This view was overthrown by the later discovery\nof Uranus as a seventh planet. Kepler\u2019s cosmology was, however,\nfar from a purely a priori exercise. Whereas his\ncontemporary, Robert Fludd, developed a cosmology structured by\nmusical numbers, which could in no way be confirmed by observation,\nKepler strove to make his system consistent with precise observations.\nKahn suggests that we here see again the split \u201cbetween a\nrational and an obscurantist version of Pythagorean thought,\u201d\nwhich is similar to the ancient split in the school between\nmathematici and acusmatici (2001, 163).\n\nClose work with observational data collected by Tycho Brahe led Kepler\nto abandon the universal ancient view that the orbits of the planets\nwere circular and to recognize their elliptical nature. More clearly\nPythagorean is Kepler\u2019s consistent belief that the data show\nthat the motions of the planets correspond in various ways to the\nratios governing the musical concords (see Dreyer 1953,\n405\u2013410), so that there is a heavenly music, a doctrine attested\nfor Philolaus and Archytas, which probably goes back to Pythagoras as\nwell. For Kepler, however, the music produced by the heavenly motions\nwas \u201cperceived by reason, and not expressed in sound\u201d\n(Harmonice Mundi V 7). In his attempt to make the numbers of\nthe heavenly music work, he joked that he would appeal to the shade of\nPythagoras for aid, \u201cunless the soul of Pythagoras has migrated\ninto mine\u201d (Koestler 1959, 277).\n\nKepler has been described \u201cas the last exponent of a form of\nmathematical cosmology that can be traced back to the shadowy figure\nof Pythagoras\u201d (Field 1988, 170). It is true that Kepler\u2019s\nwork led the way to Newton\u2019s mechanics, which cannot be\ndescribed in terms of ancient geometry and number theory but relies on\nthe calculus and which relies on a theory of physical forces that is\nalien to ancient thought. On the other hand, many modern scientists\naccept the basic tenet that knowledge of the natural world is to be\nexpressed in mathematical formulae, which is rightly regarded as a\ncentral Pythagorean thesis, since it was first rigorously formulated\nby the Pythagoreans Philolaus ( Fr. 4) and Archytas and may, in a\nrudimentary form, go back to Pythagoras himself.",
