    "main_text": "\n\nJohn Anderson (1893\u20131962) was a Scottish philosopher who worked\nprimarily in Australia. In 1927 he was appointed to the Challis Chair\nof Philosophy at the University of Sydney and occupied this position\nuntil his retirement in 1958. In relative isolation he developed a\ndistinctive realist philosophy which was inspirational for generations\nof students at Sydney. While developing this position, he carried most\nof the teaching load in philosophy at the university, wrote the\narticles for which he is primarily known, and as contributor and\neditor kept the Australasian Journal of Psychology and\nPhilosophy going. Shortly after his arrival in Sydney he acted as\ntheoretical advisor to the Communist Party of Australia, but moved\naway from the party through the 1930s and finally adopted a strongly\nanti-communist stance. He remained active throughout his career,\nhowever, in a series of public controversies concerning censorship,\nuniversity reform, academic freedom and opposition to religious\ninstruction in education. Depending upon one\u2019s perspective,\nthese activities diverted him from serious philosophical work or were\nthe natural expression of his philosophical outlook. On either view\nhis intellectual impact at Sydney was overwhelming. Philosophers such\nas David Malet Armstrong, John Passmore, John Leslie Mackie, Eugene\nKamenka, Jim Baker and David Stove all acknowledged Anderson\u2019s\nformative influence. From his early teaching at Edinburgh, Anderson\ninfluenced the social and political thought of Rush Rhees, and so also\nindirectly that of Alasdair Macintyre who came to recognise and value\ncommon themes in his own sociological and historical view of ethics.\nOutside the academy, Anderson\u2019s criticisms of conventional\nmorality and his account of positive ethical goods promoting a stance\nof commitment, endeavour, risk and critical opposition to merely\ncustomary expectations was a powerful tonic for a small but\ninfluential group of anti-careerist intellectuals, lawyers,\njournalists and artists collectively known as the \u201cSydney\nPush\u201d. \n",
