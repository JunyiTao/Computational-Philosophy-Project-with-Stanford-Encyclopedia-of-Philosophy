    "main_text": "Physical Privacy || Bodily Integrity\n2.3 Bodily Integrity\n\nAnother aspect of physical privacy is bodily integrity. Mandatory\ntesting and health evaluation offend bodily integrity by forcing\npersons to submit their bodies to unwanted touching and visual\ninspection (Allen 2014). Policy makers and the courts have generally\npermitted a great deal of nonconsensual urine testing of school\nchildren and people in jobs tied to public safety, public service and\ncrime control. Drivers can be subjected to alcohol intoxication\nscreening at road blocks or in hospital emergency rooms after\naccidents to promote highway safety. The concerns about neuroimaging\nand lie detection raised earlier in this article under the rubric of\nsecrecy could as easily be raised here in connection with bodily\nintegrity. Nonconsensual uses of imaging and lie-detection to assess\nhonesty or character arguably demeans and disrespects autonomous moral\nagents and assaults bodily integrity. The philosophical issue here is\nwhether there is some limit to the right of government to sidestep\npersons\u2019 preferences about the handling of their bodies, body\nfluids and tissue samples. These issues arise in peace and war, and\nwith respect to the living and the dead. Certainly, law-based\nconstraints exist, but so too do principle-based and other moral\nconstraints (Faden et al. 1986). Western cultures respect the\nintegrity of a deceased\u2019s body; however advances in transplant\nmedicine mean the newly dead are a garden of healthy organs that could\nbe used to save and extend lives. Organ harvesting with or without\nconsent may be defended on utilitarian moral grounds. Of particular\nphilosophical import is the issue of whether the bodily integrity of a\nperson is violated when organs and/or tissue are harvested prior to\nbrain death or prior to cardiac death. A related philosophical\nquestion is whether a legal regime of opting into organ donation or\nopting out of organ donation better serves the demands of justice and\nmorality. Post-mortem sperm donation raises important ethical\nquestions about bodily integrity. Harvesting the sperm of a deceased\nman raises concerns about respect for corpses; using sperm to create\nembryos and ultimately to parent the children of dead men raises\nconcerns about parental autonomy and beneficence toward children.\n",
