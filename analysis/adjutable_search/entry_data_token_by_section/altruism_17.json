    "main_text": "Why care about others? || Sentimentalism and fellow feeling\n4.4 Sentimentalism and fellow feeling\n\nSome philosophers would say that the approaches to altruism discussed\nthus far are missing an important\u2014perhaps the most\nimportant\u2014ingredient in moral motivation. These approaches, one\nmight say, make altruism a matter of the head, but it is much more a\nmatter of the heart. The eudaimonist can say that we should have a\ncertain amount of fellow feeling, but justifies that emotional\nresponse by giving a self-interested reason for being so motivated.\nThe consequentialist seems to leave no legitimate room in our moral\nthinking for the friendly feelings and love we have for particular\nindividuals, for these sentiments are often at odds with the project\nof increasing the total amount of good in the world. The weak\nimpartialist says that in certain situations we are to be moved by the\ngood of others, but that is only because there is a moral rule,\nstriking a reasonable balance between oneself and others, that\nrequires one to do so. All three approaches\u2014so the objection\ngoes\u2014are too cold and calculating. They call upon us to treat\nothers in accordance with a formula or rule or general policy. What is\nmost important in human relationships cannot be captured by an\napproach that begins with a general rule about how to treat others,\nand justifies a certain way of treating each particular individual\nsimply by applying that general rule. \n\nIt would miss the point of this critique if one said, in response,\nthat having an emotional response to the good of others is an\neffective means of getting oneself to give them the aid they need.\n(For example, the consequentialist can say that this doctrine does\ncall upon us to act on the basis of friendly feelings and love towards\nparticular individuals, because over the long run relationships\nsolidified by such sentiments are likely to result in a greater\nbalance of good over bad than would colder relationships.) But a\ndefender of the critique put forward in the preceding paragraph would\nreply that one\u2019s emotional response to the good or ill of others\ncan be assessed as appropriate independently of the effectiveness of\none\u2019s emotions as motivators of action. When we feel compassion\nfor the suffering of a particular individual, that reaction is already\njustified; the suffering of another ought to elicit such a response\nsimply because that is the appropriate reaction. Consider, as an\nanalogy, the proper reaction to the death of a loved one; this calls\nforth grief and ought to do so, even though grief cannot undo\none\u2019s loss. In the same way, it could be said that altruistic\nfeelings are the appropriate response to the good and ill of others,\nquite apart from whether those feelings lead to results. That does not\nimply that it does not matter whether one does anything for\nthe good of others. One ought to alleviate their suffering and seek\ntheir well-being; that is because this is the proper behavioral\nexpression of one\u2019s feeling for them. If, in the face of the\nsuffering of others, one feels nothing and offers no help, the\nfundamental flaw in one\u2019s response is one\u2019s emotional\nindifference, and a secondary flaw is the failure to act that flows\nfrom that emotional defect.\n\nAccording to this \u201csentimentalist\u201d approach to altruism,\nthe question, \u201cwhy should one act for the sake of others and not\nonly for one\u2019s own sake?\u201d should not be answered by\nappealing to some notion of impartiality or some conception of\nwell-being. That would be no better than trying to justify grief by\nway of impartiality or well-being. The sentimentalist simply asks us\nto recognize that the situation of this or that human being (or\nanimal) rightly calls forth a certain emotional response, and the help\nwe give is the proper expression of that sentiment.\n",
