    "main_text": "Can God Undo the Done? || . A Supplementary Approach\n6. Damian\u2019s Objective\n\n\nIt is easy to misunderstand Damian\u2019s position regarding the validity\nof the principle of non-contradiction and the possibility of altering\nthe past. This is partly due to the disorderliness of some of Damian\u2019s\nideas. There is also another important factor which promotes\nmisunderstanding. In Damian\u2019s view, there are some ideas that you\nshould not articulate even though they are true. The idea that God\ncannot undo the done counts among these.\n\n\nThe situation from which De divina omnipotentia resulted\nbegun from Damian\u2019s attempt to regulate what one may utter about God.\nDamian had been sitting at the table of Abbot Didier in Monte Cassino\nand eating. While they were eating, a passage in Jerome\u2019s letter to\nEustochium was read in which it is claimed that even though God is\ncapable of everything (omnia possit), he cannot restore\nvirginity to a woman who has lost it. Damian stated that he had always\nfound it disturbing that an inability (inpossibilitas) was so\nlightly ascribed to God. A discussion followed in which Damian defended\nthe view that God has the power of restoring virginity whereas Didier\nargued for Jerome\u2019s view that he cannot restore it. In Damian\u2019s view,\nthere is a sense in which we can say that God can restore virginity,\nand therefore we must affirm that he can restore it (596C\u2013601B).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s objective at the table of Monte Cassino was to protect the\ndoctrine of divine omnipotence by advising that we should abstain from\nsaying anything which implies that God is powerless in some respect.\nSome of the monks sitting at the table were less interested in Damian\u2019s\nadvice and more interested in the issue of omnipotence in itself. They\nwere bold enough to put a question to Damian: if God is omnipotent in\nall things, as Damian has asserted, does he have the power of bringing\nit about that what has been done has not been done (601C)? We can be\nsure that Damian found this question very annoying. It is a difficult\nquestion, and it is a question that is difficult to handle without\nmaking statements about what God cannot do. Damian does not offer us\nany report about how the discussion continued. However, there is a\nremark in De divina omnipotentia which suggests that Damian\nhimself was accused of implying that God is impotent in a certain\nrespect (620D).\n\n\nDamian\u2019s objective in De divina omnipotentia is twofold.\nFirst, Damian reiterates his point about moderation while talking about\nGod (e.g., 597B\u2013599A, 603B\u2013604B, 614D\u2013616C). He strongly advises that\nwe should abstain from spreading certain kinds of statements, even in\ncases where they are found in the Bible (597B\u2013C). Damian\u2019s most\nimportant motive here seems to be to protect the faith of the simple\nbelievers:\nFor if it should reach the common people that God is\nasserted to be impotent in some respect (which is a wicked thing to\nsay), the unschooled masses would instantly be confused and the\nChristian faith would be upset, not without grave danger to souls.\n(597C; tr. Spade 3.18\u201322).\n\n\nSecond, Damian defends himself against the accusation that he said\nthat God is impotent in a certain respect (620D). His delicate task in\nDe divina omnipotentia is to convince his readers of the view\nthat divine omnipotence remains intact even though God cannot undo the\ndone, without ever saying that God cannot undo the done because this is\n\u201ca wicked thing to say\u201d.\n",
