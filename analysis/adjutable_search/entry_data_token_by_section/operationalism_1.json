    "main_text": "Bridgman\u2019s ideas on operational analysis || Length as the showcase of operational analysis\n1.2 Length as the showcase of operational analysis\n\nBridgman found that the challenges of the unknown were amply present\neven in very prosaic circumstances. Therefore he chose to open his\ndiscussion of operational analysis in The Logic of Modern\nPhysics (Bridgman 1927) with the example of the most mundane of\nall scientific concepts: length. He was both fascinated and troubled\nby the fact that \u201cessential physical limitations\u201d forced\nscientists to use different measurement operations for the same\nconcept in different domains of phenomena. Length is measured with a\nruler only when we are dealing with dimensions that are comparable to\nour human bodies, and when the objects of measurement are moving\nslowly relative to the measurer. To measure, say, the distance to the\nmoon, we need to infer it from the amount of time that light takes to\ntravel that distance and return, and that is also the procedure taken\nup in Einstein\u2019s theorizing in special relativity; \u201cthe\nspace of astronomy is not a physical space of meter sticks, but is a\nspace of light waves\u201d (Bridgman 1927, 67). For even larger\ndistances we use the unit of \u201clight-year,\u201d but we cannot\nactually use the operation of sending off a light beam to a distant\nspeck of light in the sky and waiting for years on end until hopefully\na reflected signal comes back to us (or our descendants). Much more\ncomplex reasoning and operations are required for measuring any\ndistances beyond the solar system:\n\nThus at greater and greater distances not only does experimental\naccuracy become less, but the very nature of the operations by which\nlength is to be determined becomes indefinite\u2026. To say that a\ncertain star is 105 light years distant is actually and\nconceptually an entire different kind of thing from saying\nthat a certain goal post is 100 meters distant. (Bridgman 1927,\n17\u201318; emphasis original)\n\n\nThus operational analysis reveals that length is not one homogeneous\nconcept that applies straightforwardly in the whole range of cases in\nwhich we use it:\n\nIn principle the operations by which length is measured\nshould be uniquely specified. If we have more than one set of\noperations, we have more than one concept, and strictly there should\nbe a separate name to correspond to each different set of operations.\n(Bridgman 1927, 10; emphases original)\n\n\nIn practice scientists do not recognize multiple concepts of length,\nand Bridgman was willing to concede that it was allowable to use the\nsame name to represent a series of concepts, if the different\nmeasurement operations gave mutually consistent numerical results in\nthe areas of overlap:\n\nIf we deal with phenomena outside the domain in which we originally\ndefined our concepts, we may find physical hindrances to performing\nthe operations of the original definition, so that the original\noperations have to be replaced by others. These new operations are, of\ncourse, to be so chosen that they give, within experimental error, the\nsame numerical results in the domain in which the two sets of\noperations may be both applied. (Bridgman 1927, 23)\n\n\nHowever, such numerical convergence between the results of two\ndifferent operations was regarded by Bridgman as merely a\n\u201cpractical justification for retaining the same name\u201d for\nwhat the two operations measured (Bridgman 1927, 16).\n\nEven in such convergent situations, we have to be wary of the danger\nof slipping into conceptual confusion through the use of the same word\nto refer to the subjects of different operations. If we do not temper\nour thoughts with the operationalist conscience always referring us\nback to concrete measurement operations, we may get into the sloppy\nhabit of using one word for all sorts of different situations (without\neven checking for the required convergence in the overlapping\ndomains). Bridgman warned: \u201cour verbal machinery has no built-in\ncutoff\u201d (1959a, 75). Similarly we could be misled by the\nrepresentation of a concept as a number into thinking that there is\nnaturally an infinitely extendable scale for that concept, since the\nreal-number line continues on to infinity. It would also be easy to\nthink that physical quantities must meaningfully exist down to\ninfinite precision, just because the numerical scale we have pinned on\nthem is infinitely divisible. Bridgman issued a stark reminder:\n\nMathematics does not recognize that as the physical range increases,\nthe fundamental concepts become hazy, and eventually cease entirely to\nhave physical meaning, and therefore must be replaced by other\nconcepts which are operationally quite different. For instance, the\nequations of motion make no distinction between the motion of a star\ninto our galaxy from external space, and the motion of an electron\nabout the nucleus, although physically the meaning in terms of\noperations of the quantities in the equations is entirely different in\nthe two cases. The structure of our mathematics is such that we are\nalmost forced, whether we want to or not, to talk about the inside of\nan electron, although physically we cannot assign any meaning to such\nstatements. (Bridgman 1927, 63)\n\n\nBridgman thus emphasized that our concepts did not automatically\nextend beyond the domains in which they were originally defined. He\nwarned that concepts in far-out domains could easily become\nmeaningless for lack of applicable measurement operations. The case of\nlength in the very small scale makes that danger clear. Beyond the\nresolution of the eye, the ruler has to be given up in favor of\nvarious micrometers and microscopes. When we get to the realm of atoms\nand elementary particles, it is not clear what operations could be\nused to measure length, and not even clear what \u201clength\u201d\nmeans any more.\n",
