    "main_text": "Locke on knowledge in natural philosophy: Scientia and human knowledge || Scientia in natural philosophy and obstacles to human attainment\n2.2 Scientia in natural philosophy and obstacles to human attainment\n\nAs indicated earlier, scientia serves as the backdrop against\nwhich Locke develops the conception of the type of knowledge that is\nhumanly possible in natural philosophy. Having retained the ideal of\nscientia exemplified by geometry while also having\nassimilated the significance of Boyle\u2019s experimental method,\nLocke is driven to his characteristic pessimism about the kind and\nextent of knowledge possible for us in natural philosophy. \u201cThe\nmeanest, and most obvious Things that come in our way, have dark\nsides, that the quickest Sight cannot penetrate into\u201d (E\nIV.iii.22, p. 553). Due to the weakness of our faculties, Locke\nsuspects, \u201cnatural Philosophy is not capable of being made a\nScience\u201d (E IV.xii.10, p. 645). This section considers\nLocke\u2019s general notion of scientia, what would be\nrequired for scientia in natural philosophy, and the\nobstacles that prevent human beings from attaining scientia\nin that domain.\n2.2.1 Scientia in general\n\nLocke takes knowledge generally to consist in \u201cthe perception of\nthe connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy of any of\nour Ideas\u201d (E IV.i.1\u20132, p. 525), and among the three kinds\nof knowledge that he distinguishes\u2014intuitive, demonstrative, and\nsensitive\u2014the former two are kinds of certain knowledge.\nIntuitive and demonstrative knowledge differ in the number of\nintuitions involved, and consequently, differ in their degree of\ncertainty (E IV.ii.14, pp.537\u2013538). Intuitive knowledge is the\nmost certain because the truth is grasped immediately. There are no\nintermediate steps, and doubt is impossible because the mind can no\nmore avoid recognizing the truth than the open, functioning eye could\navoid seeing light when turned toward the sun (see E IV.ii.1, p. 531).\nDemonstrative knowledge, though also qualifying as certain, is less so\nbecause it involves intermediate steps. We cannot grasp immediately\nthat the three angles of any triangle are equal to two right triangles\nbut must instead construct the steps of a proof. Upon doing so and\ngrasping the connections among the proof\u2019s steps, we have\ndemonstrative knowledge (E IV.ii.2\u20133, p.531\u2013532).\nIntuitive and demonstrative knowledge are forms of scientia,\nthen, which Locke defines as \u201ccertain universal Knowledge\u201d\n(E IV.iii.29, p. 559). Mere \u201cparticular matters of fact\u201d\n(E IV.iii.25, pp. 555\u201356) do not qualify.\n\nTo understand Locke\u2019s notion of scientia, we must\nconsider its objects: real essences and the necessary connections that\nflow from them. According to the Aristotelian view, a single essence\nboth grounds the properties of a thing, making it what it is, and\nprovides the basis for classifying it. Repudiating that view, Locke\ndraws a distinction between real and nominal\n essences.[12]\n Whereas the nominal essence consists of the set of observable\nqualities we use to classify a thing (which implies that the nominal\nessence could vary across time or communities), the real essence (or\nreal or internal constitution, as he sometimes writes) is that which\nmakes a thing what it is.\n\nEssence may be taken for the being of any thing, whereby it is what it\nis. And thus the real internal, but generally in Substances, unknown\nConstitution of Things, whereon their discoverable Qualities depend,\nmay be called their Essence. This is the proper original\nsignification of the Word, as is evident from the formation of it;\nEssentia, in its primary notation signifying properly\nBeing. And in this sense it is still used, when we speak of\nthe Essence of particular things, without giving them any\nName (E III.iii.15, p. 417).\n\n\nDiscussion of real essence often focuses upon the real essences of\nmaterial substances, and in that case we say that the real essence is\nthe causal ground of the substance\u2019s perceivable properties (for\nfurther details and a useful chart, see the entry by Jones,\n\u201cLocke on Real Essence\u201d). As will be discussed in a\nsubsequent section, many commentators interpret Locke as identifying a\nmaterial substance\u2019s real essence with some subset of its\nconstituent corpuscles\u2019 primary qualities, but that\nidentification presums Locke\u2019s acceptance of the corpuscular\nhypothesis (e.g., Osler 1970, p. 12; Mandelbaum 1964, p.1). According\nto another interpretation, the real-nominal essence distinction is\nmetaphysical, and thus more fundamental than the primary-secondary\nquality distinction, which is a physical distinction, belonging as it\ndoes to a particular physical theory, the corpuscular hypothesis. Yet\nleaving that debate aside for the moment, we may note from the first\nsentence of the above-quoted passage that Locke does not restrict the\nnotion of real essence to substances. This means that we can speak of,\nsay, the real essence of a triangle, understanding it as that which\ngrounds the triangle\u2019s qualities, making it what it is.\n\nSince a substance\u2019s qualities flow from its real essence, having\nscientific knowledge of a substance requires knowing both its real\nessence and the necessary connections between that and its other\nqualities. Geometry serves as an exemplar, as it did for so many of\nLocke\u2019s predecessors. In knowing what a triangle is, we cannot\nconceive things being otherwise than that the sum of its three angles\nequals the sum of two right angles.\n\nSuch knowledge is so certain that we cannot conceive even of God\nhaving made things otherwise:\n\nThus the Idea of a right-line Triangle necessarily carries\nwith it an equality of its Angles to two right ones. Nor can we\nconceive this Relation, this connexion of these two Ideas, to\nbe possibly mutable, or to depend on any arbitrary Power, which of\nchoice made it thus, or could make it otherwise (E IV.iii.29, pp.\n559\u2013560).\n\n\nScientia is possible in another conceptual domain also:\nmorality. Morality is characterized by discernible necessary\nconnections, and Locke is adamant that we can have the same level of\ncertainty there as in geometry.\n\nWhere there is no Property, there is no Injustice, is a\nProposition as certain as any Demonstration in Euclid: For\nthe Idea of Property, being a right to any thing;\nand the Idea to which the Name Injustice is given,\nbeing the Invasion or Violation of that right; it is evident,\nthat\u2026I can as certainly know this Proposition to be true, as\nthat a Triangle has three Angles equal to two right ones (E IV.iii.18,\npp. 549\u201350).\n\n2.2.2 Scientia in natural philosophy\n\nWhat would be required for scientia in natural philosophy?\nSince scientia generally concerns real essences, and since\nnatural philosophy for Locke concerns material substances and their\npowers, scientia in natural philosophy would be knowledge of\nmaterial substances\u2019 real essences and their necessary\nconnections to the qualities flowing from them.\n\nIf we could have scientia in natural philosophy, we could\nknow a substance\u2019s qualities without making observations or\nexperiments. To take one of Locke\u2019s frequent examples, if we\ncould know gold\u2019s real essence, we would then know its\nqualities, even if not a single sample of gold existed.\n\nHad we such Ideas of Substances, as to know what real\nConstitutions produce those sensible Qualities we find in them, and\nhow those Qualities flowed from thence, we could, by the specifick\nIdeas of their real Essences in our own Minds, more certainly\nfind out their Properties, and discover what Qualities they had, or\nhad not, than we can now by our Senses: and to know the Properties of\nGold, it would be no more necessary, that Gold\nshould exist, and that we should make Experiments upon it, than it is\nnecessary for the knowing the Properties of a Triangle, that a\nTriangle should exist in any Matter, the Idea in our Minds\nwould serve for the one, as well as the other (E IV.vi.11, p. 585).\n\n\nWhich qualities exactly would we be able to deduce? We would be able\nto deduce a substance\u2019s tertiary qualities, that is, its powers\nto produce certain effects in other\n substances.[13]\n If we knew the real essences of opium and hemlock, then just as if we\nwere performing a geometric deduction, or just as a locksmith\nunderstands why a given key will open one lock rather than another, we\ncould deduce that opium produces sleep, that hemlock causes death and\nwhy each substance produces its effects.\n\nI doubt not but if we could discover the Figure, Size, Texture, and\nMotion of the minute Constituent parts of any two Bodies, we should\nknow without Trial several of the Operations one upon another, as we\ndo now the Properties of a Square, or a Triangle. Did we know the\nMechanical affections of the Particles of Rhubarb, Hemlock,\nOpium, and a Man, as a Watchmaker does those of a Watch,\nwhereby it performs its Operations, and of a File which by rubbing on\nthem will alter the Figure of any of the Wheels, we should be able to\ntell before Hand, that Rhubarb will purge, Hemlock\nkill, and Opium make a Man sleep\u2026.The dissolving of\nSilver in aqua fortis, and Gold in aqua Regia, and\nnot vice versa, would be then, perhaps, no more difficult to\nknow, that it is to a Smith to understand, why the turning of one Key\nwill open a Lock, and not the turning of another (E IV.iii.25, pp.\n555\u201356) (cf. Boyle, who had had the same idea, explaining it at\nlength in The Origin of Forms and Qualities, 1666, pp.\n16\u201319).\n\n\nKnowing real essences would enable us to deduce tertiary qualities,\nthen. What about secondary qualities, however? Here, matters are\ninitially less clear; Locke seems to be saying that while having more\nacute senses would not eliminate the secondary quality of sound, but\nmight do away with the secondary quality of color. In a passage where\nhe imagines our having very acute senses, including\n\u201cmicroscopical eyes,\u201d he unquestionably assumes that we\nwould still experience the secondary quality of sound: \u201cIf our\nSense of Hearing were but 1000 times quicker than it is, how would a\nperpetual noise distract us\u201d (E II.xxiii.12, pp. 302\u2013303).\nYet, in a preceding passage, he suggested that if our faculties were\ndesigned for detecting real essences, we would not experience color at\nall:\n\nHad we Senses acute enough to discern the minute particles of Bodies,\nand the real Constitution on which their sensible Qualities depend, I\ndoubt not but they would produce quite different Ideas in us;\nand that which is now the yellow Colour of Gold, would disappear, and\ninstead of it we should see an admirable Texture of parts of a certain\nSize and Figure. This Microscopes plainly discover to us: for what to\nour naked Eyes produces a certain Colour, is by thus augmenting the\nacuteness of our Senses, discovered to be quite a different thing; and\nthe thus altering, as it were, the proportion of the Bulk of the\nminute parts of a coloured Object to our usual Sight, produces\ndifferent Ideas, from what it did before\u2026.Blood to the\nnaked Eye appears all red; but by a good Microscope, wherein its\nlesser parts appear, shews only some few Globules of Red, swimming in\na pellucid Liquor; and how these red Globules would appear, if Glasses\ncould be found, that yet could magnify them 1000 or 10000 times more,\nis uncertain (E II.xxiii.11, pp. 301\u2013302).\n\n\nReflecting upon these examples, however, suggests that he is not, or\nnot always, imagining that microscopical eyes would do away with color\naltogether; rather, it might in some cases enable us to view tinier\nparticles having different colors than those we perceive in the\naggregate object. In his example, only as an aggregate body does blood\nas an aggregate body appears uniformly red; under a microscope, only\nthe globules appear red, while some other parts of it seem\ntranslucent. Once the microscope is used, color is not eliminated from\nthe experience of seeing blood, but is instead seen as being\ndifferently distributed. A pixelated painting provides a rough\nanalogy; a shape seen from afar may appear uniformly green, but up\nclose is seen as comprising tiny blue and yellow dots.\n2.2.3 Obstacles to human attainment\n\nScientia in natural philosophy would require knowledge of\nboth real essences and their necessary connections among qualities,\nyet neither is possible for human beings, Locke concludes. One\nobstacle to scientia, then, is that real essences escape us.\nGod has given us sensory capacities that are suitable for such\npractical endeavors as finding our way to the \u201cmarket and\nexchange,\u201d but as the \u201cmicroscopical eyes\u201d passage\nindicates, they are not useful for detecting the minute parts of\nbodies.\n\nAnother obstacle is that we are almost entirely unable to discern the\nnecessary causal connections among the qualities of substances. (And\nLocke does take those connections to be necessary\u2014but does he\nconstrue them in terms of nomological or logical necessity? Given his\nview that demonstrative knowledge in natural philosophy is possible\nfor immortals and serves as an ideal for mortals, he seems to be\nthinking in terms of logical necessity, much like the Aristotelians he\nwas reacting against (see Ott, 2009, p. 13). Locke does find two\ninstances in which we can discern necessary connections between\nqualities of bodies: \u201cSome few of the primary Qualities have a\nnecessary dependence, and visible connexion one with another, as\nFigure necessarily presupposes Extension, receiving or communicating\nMotion by impulse, supposes Solidity\u201d (E IV.iii.14, p. 546).\nApart from these two exceptions, however, necessary connections escape\nus. In part, this is due to the first obstacle, our inability to\ndiscover real essences, due to the minuteness of particles. It is also\ndue, however, to the remoteness of so many bodies, those which lie\n\u201cbeyond this our Earth and Atmosphere\u2026even beyond the\nSun, or remotest Star our Eyes have yet discovered\u201d (E IV.vi.11,\np.586\u201387, and IV.vi.12, p.587). For according to Locke\u2019s\nspeculations, all things might be causally interconnected in complex\nways, in which case knowing one real essence would require knowing all\nthose with which it is causally connected.\n\nStill, while human beings cannot attain scientia in natural\nphilosophy, there are other epistemic agents who can. God certainly\nknows real essences (E III.vi.3, p. 440), and \u201c\u2019tis\npossible Angels have\u201d ideas of real essences as well (E\nIII.vi.3, p. 440).\n\nIt be not to be doubted, that Spirits of a higher rank than those\nimmersed in Flesh, may have as clear Ideas of the radical\nConstitution of Substances, as we have of a Triangle, and so perceive\nhow all their Properties and Operations flow from thence, but the\nmanner how they come by that Knowledge, exceeds our Conceptions (E\nIII.xi.22, p. 520).\n\n\nThat Locke finds it natural to speak in the same breath of matter and\nspirits marks him as belonging to the age of natural philosophy rather\nthan science. It is because knowledge of necessary connections can be\nreferred to these higher epistemic agents that scientia is so\nstrongly entrenched as an ideal, even though he recognizes the need\nfor a quite different conception of knowledge.\n",
