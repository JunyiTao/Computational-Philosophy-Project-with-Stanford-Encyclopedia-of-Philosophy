This fact, together with\nthe authority of Aristotle\u2019s anti-indivisibilism and the\nexplosion of technical and theoretical power dealing with the infinite\nin modern mathematics have led modern critics to see Chatton\u2019s\nindivisibilism as hopelessly na\u00efve. Moreover, his\nReportatio discussion on indivisibles sometimes displays\nconfusing exposition and abrupt changes of mind, perhaps under\npressure from contemporary critiques. If one reads only these texts\nand thinks of continua in modern terms, the negative assessment of him\nseems confirmed.\n\nMoreover, his views sound odd when baldly stated. Chatton claims, in\nrelation to the question whether angelic motion is continuous or\ndiscrete, that we must investigate the prior question \u201cIs a\nquantum composed from indivisibles, either permanent\nindivisibles or successive indivisibles?\u201d And his response is\nthat, yes, quanta are composed of indivisibles, but in\npotentia, where in potentia seems to imply\nan unusual part/whole relationship: these indivisibles are\nnot naturally separable from the wholes they compose, moreover they do\nnot exist separately and then aggregate to compose these wholes by\njoining with other indivisibles in making them be one thing per\nse. Indivisibles are in continua, they can be said to make up\nthat which they are a part of, but not by aggregation or\nconglomeration. Moreover, while God can complete the division of any\nfinite continua, such continua themselves are only finitely\ndivisible! It is this finitist claim that seems most baffling.\n\nOverall, we have an odd-sounding view, and it is hard to see why\nsomeone would hold it. The best way to understand Chatton\u2019s\nindivisibilism fairly is to turn from his Reportatio toward a\ndifferent text and to view his opinions as a direct response to\nAristotle\u2019s anti-indivisibilist arguments. Therefore some of\nthese arguments must be briefly exposited.\n",
