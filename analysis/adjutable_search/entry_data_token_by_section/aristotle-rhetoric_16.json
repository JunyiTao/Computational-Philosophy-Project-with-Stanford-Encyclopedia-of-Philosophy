    "main_text": "The Enthymeme || The Brevity of the Enthymeme\n6.4 The Brevity of the Enthymeme\n\nIn a well-known passage (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7\u201318; similar:\nRhet. II.22, 1395b24\u201326), Aristotle says that the\nenthymeme often has few or even fewer premises than some other\ndeductions (sullogismoi). Since most interpreters refer the\nword \u2018sullogismos\u2019 to the syllogistic theory (see\nthe entry on\n Aristotle: logic),\n according to which a proper deduction has exactly two premises, those\nlines have led to the widespread understanding that Aristotle defines\nthe enthymeme as a sullogismos in which one of two premises\nhas been suppressed, i.e., as an abbreviated, incomplete syllogism.\nBut certainly the passages mentioned do not attempt to give a\ndefinition of the enthymeme, nor does the word\n\u2018sullogismos\u2019 necessarily refer to deductions\nwith exactly two premises. Properly understood, both passages are\nabout the selection of appropriate premises, not about logical\nincompleteness. The remark that enthymemes often have few or fewer\npremises concludes the discussion of two possible mistakes the orator\ncould make (Rhet. I.2, 1357a7\u201310): One can draw\nconclusions from things that have previously been deduced or from\nthings that have not been deduced yet. The latter method is\nunpersuasive, for the premises are not accepted, nor have they been\nintroduced. The former method is problematic, too: if the orator has\nto introduce the needed premises by another deduction, and the\npremises of this pre-deduction too, etc., one will end up with a long\nchain of deductions. Arguments with several deductive steps are common\nin dialectical practice, but one cannot expect the audience of a\npublic speech to follow such long arguments. This is why Aristotle\nsays that the enthymeme is and should be from fewer premises.\n\nSupplement on The Brevity of the Enthymeme\n\n",
