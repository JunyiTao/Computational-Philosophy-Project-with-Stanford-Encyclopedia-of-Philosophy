Disunity and pluralism\n\nA more radical departure from logical-positivist standards of unity is\nthe recent criticism of the methodological values of reductionism and\nunification in the sciences and also its position in culture and\nsociety. From the descriptive standpoint, many views under the\nrubric of disunity are versions of positions mentioned above. The\ndifference is mainly normative and a matter of emphasis, scope and\nperspective. Such views reject global or universal standards of\nunity\u2014including unity of method\u2014by emphasizing disunity\nand endorsing different forms of epistemological and ontological\npluralism.\n",
