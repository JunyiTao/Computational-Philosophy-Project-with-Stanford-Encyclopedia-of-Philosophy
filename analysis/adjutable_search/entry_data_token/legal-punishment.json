Legal Punishment and Its Justification\n\nThe central question asked by philosophers of punishment is: What can\njustify punishment? More precisely, since they do not usually talk\nmuch about punishment in such contexts as the family or the workplace\n(but see Zaibert 2006; Bennett 2008: Part II), their question is this:\nWhat can justify formal, legal punishment imposed by the state on\nthose convicted of committing criminal offences? We will also focus on\nlegal punishment here: not because the other species of punishment do\nnot raise important normative questions (they do), nor because such\nquestions can be answered in terms of an initial justification of\nlegal punishment as being the paradigm case (since it\u2019s not\nclear that they can be), but because legal punishment, apart from\nbeing more dramatically coercive and burdensome than other species of\npunishment usually are, raises distinctive issues about the role of\nthe state and its relationship to its citizens, and about the role of\nthe criminal law. Future references to \u2018punishment\u2019 should\ntherefore be read, unless otherwise specified, as references to legal\nor criminal punishment.\n\nWhat then are we to justify in justifying punishment? The search for a\nprecise definition of punishment that exercised some philosophers (for\ndiscussion and references, see Scheid 1980; Boonin 2008: 3\u201328;\nZimmerman 2011: ch. 1) is likely to prove futile; but we can say that\nlegal punishment involves the imposition of something that is intended\nto be both burdensome and reprobative, on a supposed offender for a\nsupposed crime, by a person or body who claims the authority to do so.\nTwo points are worth particular notice here.\n\nFirst, punishment involves material impositions or exactions that are\nin themselves typically unwelcome: they deprive people of things that\nthey value (liberty, money, time); they require people to do things\nthat they would not normally want to do or do voluntarily (to spend\ntime on unpaid community labour, to report to a probation officer\nregularly, to undertake demanding programmes of various kinds). What\ndistinguishes punishment from other kinds of coercive imposition, such\nas taxation, is that punishment is precisely intended to\n\u2026: but to what? Some would say that punishment is intended to\ninflict pain or suffering: but that suggests that what matters is pain\nor suffering as such (and invites the familiar criticism that we and\nthe state should not be in the business of trying to inflict pain or\nsuffering on people; see Christie 1981 on\n\u2018pain-delivery\u2019), which some penal theorists would reject\nas a distortion. Others would say that punishment is intended to cause\nharm to the offender \u2014 adding, if they are careful (see Hanna\n2014: s. 2) that what is intended is \u2018prima facie harm\u2019\nrather than \u2018all-things-considered harm\u2019, to allow for the\npossibility that punishment might be, or might be intended to be, on\nbalance beneficial to the offender. But some theorists would deny even\nthis, since they would deny that punishment must be intended to be\n\u2018intrinsically bad\u2019 for the person punished. It is safer\nto say that punishment must be intended to be burdensome, and that is\nhow punishment will be understood in what follows. (For running debate\nabout this intentionality feature, see Wringe 2013, Hanna 2017, Wringe\n2019, Hanna 2020.)\n\nSecond, it is widely accepted that what distinguishes punishment from\nmere \u2018penalties\u2019 (see Feinberg 1970) is their reprobative\nor condemnatory character. Penalties, such as parking tickets, might\nbe imposed to deter the penalised conduct (or to recoup some of the\ncosts that it causes) without being intended to express societal\ncondemnation. But even if a primary purpose of punishment is\ndeterrence (see ss. 3\u20134 below), its imposition (the conviction\nand formal sentence that the offender receives in court, the\nadministration of the punishment itself) also expresses the censure or\ncondemnation that the offender\u2019s crime is taken to warrant.\n\nThese two features, that punishment is intentionally burdensome and\ncondemnatory, make the practice especially normatively challenging.\nHow can a practice that not only burdens those subjected to it but\naims to burden them, and which conveys society\u2019s condemnation,\nbe justified?\n\nWe should not assume, however, that there is only one question of\njustification, which can receive just one answer. As Hart famously\npointed out (Hart 1968: 1\u201327), we must distinguish at least\nthree justificatory issues. First, what compelling reason is there to\ncreate and maintain a system of punishment: what good can it achieve,\nwhat duty can it fulfil, what moral demand can it satisfy? (Hart\ntermed this the question of punishment's \u2018general justifying\naim\u2019, although the term may be misleading in that talk of\n\u2018aims\u2019 may seem to privilege a consequentialist answer to\nthe question, whereas the compelling reason could be a\nnonconsequentialist one.) Second, who may properly be punished: what\nprinciples or aims should determine the allocations of punishments to\nindividuals? Third, how should the appropriate amount of punishment be\ndetermined: how should sentencers go about deciding what sentence to\nimpose? (One dimension of this third question concerns the amount or\nseverity of punishment; another, which is insufficiently discussed by\nphilosophers, concerns the concrete modes of punishment that should be\navailable, in general or for particular crimes.) It might of course\nturn out that answers to all these questions will flow from a single\ntheoretical foundation \u2014 for instance, from a unitary\nconsequentialist principle specifying the good that punishment should\nachieve, or from some version of the retributivist principle that the\nsole proper aim of punishment is to impose on the guilty the punitive\nburdens they deserve. But matters might not be as simple as that: we\nmight find that quite different and conflicting values are relevant to\ndifferent issues about punishment, and that any complete normative\naccount of punishment will have to find a place for these values and\noffer guidance in how to resolve tensions among them when they\nconflict (see s. 6).\n\nEven this way of putting the matter oversimplifies it, by implying\nthat we can hope to find a \u2018complete normative account of\npunishment\u2019: an account, that is, of how punishment can be\njustified. It is certainly an implicit assumption of much\nphilosophical and legal discussion that punishment can, of course, be\njustified, and that the theorists\u2019 task is to establish and\nexplicate that justification. But it is an illegitimate assumption:\nnormative theorists must be open to the possibility, startling and\ndisturbing as it might be, that this pervasive human practice cannot\nbe justified. Nor is this merely the kind of fantastical scepticism\nthat moral philosophers are sometimes prone to imagine (\u2018suppose\nsomeone denied that killing for pleasure was wrong\u2019): there is a\nsignificant strand of \u2018abolitionist\u2019 penal theorising (the\nsubject of increasing philosophical attention in recent years) that\nargues precisely that legal punishment cannot be justified and should\nbe abolished.\n\nWe will attend to some abolitionist arguments in section 7. Even if\nthose arguments can be met, even if legal punishment can be justified,\nat least in principle, the abolitionist challenge is one that must be\nmet, rather than ignored; and it will help to remind us of the ways in\nwhich any practice of legal punishment is bound to be morally\nproblematic.\n2. Punishment, Crime, and the State\n\nLegal punishment presupposes crime as that for which punishment is\nimposed, and a criminal law as that which defines crimes as crimes; a\nsystem of criminal law presupposes a state, which has the political\nauthority to make and enforce the law and to impose punishments. A\nnormative account of legal punishment and its justification must thus\nat least presuppose, and should perhaps make explicit, a normative\naccount of the criminal law (why should we have a criminal law at\nall?) and of the proper powers and functions of the state (by what\nauthority or right does the state make and declare law, and impose\npunishments on those who break it?). (See generally Duff 2018: ch.\n1.)\n\nRecent scholarship has thus seen a growing interest in grounding\nanalysis of the justification of punishment in a political theory of\nthe state. Many of these accounts are based on Rawls\u2019s political\ntheory or on other versions of constructivism (see Matravers 2000 and\n2011b; Dolovich 2004; Brettschneider 2007; Flanders 2017; for\ncritiques of such accounts, see Garvey 2004, Dagger 2011b). Several\nothers are based on versions of republicanism (see Pettit 1997; Duff\n2001; Dagger 2007 and 2011a; Yankah 2015; for other recent\ncontributions showing the importance of political theory, see Brudner\n2009; Brooks 2011; Sigler 2011; Markel 2012; Chiao 2016 and 2018). How\nfar it matters, in this context, to make explicit a political theory\nof the state depends on how far different plausible political theories\nwill generate different accounts of how punishment can be justified\nand should be used. We cannot pursue this question here (for two\nsharply contrasting views on it, see Philips 1986; M. Davis 1989),\nsave to note one central point. For any political theory that takes\nseriously the idea of citizenship as full membership of the polity,\nthe problem of punishment takes a particularly acute form, since we\nhave now to ask how punishment can be consistent with citizenship (how\ncitizens can legitimately punish each other): if we are not to say\nthat those who commit crimes thereby forfeit their status as citizens\n(see s. 6 below), we must \u2014 if we are to justify punishment at\nall \u2014 show how the imposition of punishment can be consistent\nwith, or even expressive of, the respect that citizens owe to each\nother. (Punishment is also, of course, imposed on non-citizens who\ncommit crimes within a state\u2019s territory: on the primacy of\ncitizenship in understanding criminal law and its authority, and on\nthe status of non-citizens, see Duff 2013 and 2018: ch. 3; Wringe\n2021.)\n\nBefore we tackle such theories of punishment, however, we should look\nbriefly at the concept of crime, since that is one focus of the\nabolitionist critique of punishment.\n\nOn a simple positivist view of law, crimes are kinds of conduct that\nare prohibited, on pain of threatened sanctions, by the law; and for\npositivists such as Bentham, who combine positivism with a normative\nconsequentialism, the questions of whether we should maintain a\ncriminal law at all, and of what kinds of conduct should be\ncriminalised, are to be answered by trying to determine whether and\nwhen this method of controlling human conduct is likely to produce a\nnet increase in good. Such a perspective seems inadequate, however:\ninadequate both to the claims of the criminal law, which presents its\ndemands as something other or more than those of a gunman writ large\n\u2014 as something other or more than \u2018Behave thus, or\nelse!\u2019 \u2014 and to the normative issues at stake when we ask\nwhat kinds of conduct should be criminalised. For the criminal law\nportrays crime not merely as conduct which has been prohibited, but as\na species of wrongdoing: whether our inquiry is analytical (into the\nconcept of crime) or normative (as to what kinds of conduct, if any,\nshould be criminal), we must therefore focus on that notion of\nwrongdoing.\n\nCrimes are, at least, socially proscribed wrongs \u2014 kinds of\nconduct that are condemned as wrong by some purportedly authoritative\nsocial norm. That is to say that they are wrongs which are not merely\n\u2018private\u2019 affairs, which properly concern only those\ndirectly involved in them: the community as a whole \u2014 in this\ncase, the political community speaking through the law \u2014 claims\nthe right to declare them to be wrongs. But crimes are\n\u2018public\u2019 wrongs in a sense that goes beyond this. Tort\nlaw, for instance, deals in part with wrongs that are non-private in\nthat they are legally and socially declared as wrongs \u2014 with the\nwrong constituted by libel, for instance. But they are still treated\nas \u2018private\u2019 wrongs in the sense that it is up to the\nperson who was wronged to seek legal redress. She must decide to\nbring, or not to bring, a civil case against the person who wronged\nher; and although she can appeal to the law to protect her rights, the\ncase is still between her and the defendant. By contrast, a criminal\ncase is between the whole political community \u2014 the state or the\npeople \u2014 and the defendant: the wrong is \u2018public\u2019 in\nthe sense that it is one for which the wrongdoer must answer not just\nto the individual victim, but to the whole polity through its criminal\ncourts.\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to give a clear and plausible account of\nthe distinction between civil and criminal law, between\n\u2018private\u2019 and \u2018public\u2019 legal wrongs, whether\nour interest is in the analytical question of what the distinction\namounts to, or in the normative question of which kinds of wrong\nshould fall into which category (see Murphy and Coleman 1984: ch. 3; a\nsymposium in Boston University Law Review vol. 76 (1996):\n1\u2013373; Lamond 2007). It might be tempting to say that crimes are\n\u2018public\u2019 wrongs in the sense that they injure the whole\ncommunity: they threaten social order, for instance, or cause\n\u2018social volatility\u2019 (Becker 1974); or they involve taking\nunfair advantage over those who obey the law (H. Morris 1968:\n477\u201380; Murphy 1973; Dagger 1993 and 2008); or they undermine\nthe trust on which social life depends (Dimock 1997). But such\naccounts distract our attention from the wrongs done to the individual\nvictims that most crimes have, when it is those wrongs that should be\nour central concern: we should condemn the rapist or murderer, we\nshould see the wrong he has done as our concern, because of what he\nhas done to his victim. Another suggestion is that\n\u2018public\u2019 wrongs are those that flout the community\u2019s\nessential or most basic values, in which all members of the community\nshould see themselves as sharing: the wrong is done to\n\u2018us\u2019, not merely to its individual victim, in the sense\nthat we identify ourselves with the victim as a fellow citizen (see\nMarshall and Duff 1998; Duff 2007: ch. 6; and see further section 6 of\nthe entry on\n theories of criminal law).\n\nSome abolitionists, however, argue that we should seek to eliminate\nthe concept of crime from our social vocabulary: we should talk and\nthink not of \u2018crimes\u2019, but of \u2018conflicts\u2019 or\n\u2018troubles\u2019 (Christie 1977; Hulsman 1986). One motivation\nfor this might be the thought that \u2018crime\u2019 entails\npunishment as the appropriate response: but that is not so, since we\ncould imagine a system of criminal law without punishment. To define\nsomething as a \u2018crime\u2019 does indeed imply that some kind of\npublic response is appropriate, since it is to define it as a kind of\nwrong that properly concerns the whole community; and it implies that\nthat response should be a condemnatory one, since to identify wrongs\nas wrongs is to mark them out as apt for condemnation: but that\npublic, condemnatory response could consist in nothing more than, for\ninstance, some version of a criminal trial which calls the alleged\nwrongdoer to answer for her alleged wrongdoing, and condemns her for\nit, through a criminal conviction, if she is proved guilty. One can of\ncourse count a criminal conviction as a kind of punishment: but it\ndoes not entail the kind of materially burdensome punishment, imposed\nafter conviction, with which penal theorists are primarily\nconcerned.\n\nAnother possible motivation for the abolitionist objection to the\nconcept of crime is a kind of moral relativism that objects to the\n\u2018imposition\u2019 of values on those who might not share them\n(Bianchi 1994: 71\u201397): but since abolitionists are very ready to\ntell us, insistently, how we ought to respond to conflicts or\ntroubles, and how a state ought or ought not to treat its citizens,\nsuch an appeal to relativism reflects serious confusion (see Williams\n1976: 34\u201339). More plausibly, the abolitionist claim could be\nthat rather than take wrongdoing as our focus, we should focus on the\nharm that has been done, and on how it can be repaired; we will return\nto this suggestion in section 7 below.\n\nAnother abolitionist concern is that by defining and treating conduct\nas \u2018criminal\u2019, the law \u2018steals\u2019 the conflicts\nwhich crime involves from those to whom they properly belong (Christie\n1977): instead of allowing, and helping, those who find themselves in\nconflict to resolve their trouble, the law takes the matter over and\ntranslates it into the professionalised context of the criminal\njustice system, in which neither \u2018victim\u2019 nor\n\u2018offender\u2019 is allowed any appropriate or productive role.\nNow it is a familiar and disturbing truth that our existing criminal\nprocesses \u2014 both in their structure and in their actual\noperations \u2014 tend to preclude any effective participation by\neither victims or offenders, although an adequate response to the\ncriminal wrong that was done should surely involve them both. One\nresponse is to argue, as some abolitionists do, that our response to\ncrime should consist not in punishment, but in a process of mediation\nor \u2018restoration\u2019 between victim and offender (see s. 7\nbelow); but another is to insist that we should retain a distinctive\ncriminal process of trials, and punishment, in which the polity as a\nwhole, acting on behalf of the victim as well as on its own behalf,\ncalls the criminal wrongdoer to account \u2014 but that victims and\noffenders should be given a more active role in that process (see\nfurther Duff et al 2007, esp. chs. 3\u20135, 7). Such an insistence\non the need for a public criminal process reflects two aspects of the\nconcept of crime: first, it is sometimes important to recognise that a\nsituation involves not just people in \u2018conflict\u2019, but a\nvictim who has been wronged and an offender who has done the wrong;\nsecond, some such wrongs are \u2018public\u2019 wrongs in the sense\nsketched above \u2014 wrongs that properly concern not just those\ndirectly affected, but all members of the political community. Faced,\nfor instance, by feuding neighbours who persistently accuse each other\nof more or less trivial wrongs, it might indeed be appropriate to\nsuggest that they should forget about condemning each other and look\nfor a way of resolving their conflict. But faced by a rapist and the\nperson he raped, or by a violent husband and the wife he has been\nbeating up, it would a betrayal both of the victim and of the values\nto which we are supposedly committed to portray the situation merely\nas a \u2018conflict\u2019 which the parties should seek to resolve:\nwhatever else or more we can do, we must recognise and declare that\nhere is a victim who has been seriously wronged; and we must be\ncollectively ready to censure the offender\u2019s action as a wrong\n(for a useful discussion of the significance of criminal law in the\ncontext of domestic violence, see Dempsey 2009).\n\nHowever, to argue that we should retain the concept of crime, that we\nshould maintain a criminal law which defines and condemns a category\nof \u2018public\u2019 wrongs, is not yet to say that we should\nmaintain a penal system that punishes those who commit such wrongs;\nwhile a system of criminal law might require something like a system\nof criminal trials that will authoritatively identify and condemn\ncriminal wrongdoers, it does not of its nature require the imposition\nof further sanctions on such wrongdoers. So, we must turn now to the\nquestion of what could justify such a system of punishment.\n3. Consequentialist Accounts\n\nMany people, including those who do not take a consequentialist view\nof other matters, think that any adequate justification of punishment\nmust be basically consequentialist. For we have here a practice that\ninflicts, indeed seeks to inflict, significant hardship or burdens:\nhow else could we hope to justify it than by showing that it brings\nconsequential benefits sufficiently large to outweigh, and thus to\njustify, those burdens? We need not be Benthamite utilitarians to be\nmoved by Bentham\u2019s famous remark that \u201call punishment in\nitself is evil. ... [I]f it ought at all to be admitted, it ought only\nto be admitted in as far as it promises to exclude some greater\nevil\u201d (Bentham 1789: ch. XIII.2). However, when we try to flesh\nout this simple consequentialist thought into something closer to a\nfull normative account of punishment, problems begin to appear.\n\nA consequentialist must justify punishment (if she is to justify it at\nall) as a cost-effective means to certain independently identifiable\ngoods (for two simple examples of such theories, see Wilson 1983;\nWalker 1991). Whatever account she gives of the final good or goods at\nwhich all action ultimately aims, the most plausible immediate good\nthat a system of punishment can bring is the reduction of crime. A\nrational consequentialist system of law will define as criminal only\nconduct that is in some way harmful; in reducing crime we will thus be\nreducing the harms that crime causes. It is commonly suggested that\npunishment can help to reduce crime by deterring, incapacitating, or\nreforming potential offenders (though for an argument that\nincapacitation is not a genuinely punitive aim, see Hoskins 2016:\n260). (There are of course other goods that a system of punishment can\nbring. It can reassure those who fear crime that the state is taking\nsteps to protect them\u2014though this is a good that, in a\nwell-informed society, will be achieved only insofar as the more\nimmediate preventive goods are achieved. It can also bring\nsatisfaction to those who want to see wrongdoers suffer \u2014 though\nto show that to be a genuine good, rather than merely a means of\naverting vigilantism and private revenge, we would need to show that\nit involves something more than mere vengeance, which would be to make\nsense of some version of retributivism.)\n\nIn consequentialist terms, punishment will be justified if it is an\neffective means of achieiving its aim, if its benefits outweigh its\ncosts, and if there is no less burdensome means of achieving the same\naim. It is a contingent question whether punishment can satisfy these\nconditions, and some objections to punishment rest on the empirical\nclaim that it cannot \u2014 that there are more effective and less\nburdensome methods of crime reduction (see Wootton 1963; Menninger\n1968; Golash 2005: chs. 2 and 8; Boonin 2008: 53, 264-67). Our focus\nhere, however, will be on the moral objections to consequentialist\naccounts of punishment \u2014 objections, basically, that\ncrime-reductive efficiency does not suffice to justify a system of\npunishment.\n\nThe most familiar line of objection to consequentialist penal theories\ncontends that consequentialists would be committed to regarding\nmanifestly unjust punishments (the punishment of those known to be\ninnocent, for instance, or excessively harsh punishment of the guilty)\nto be in principle justified if they would efficiently serve the aim\nof crime reduction: but such punishments would be wrong, because they\nwould be unjust (see e.g., McCloskey 1957: 468-69; Hart 1968, chs.\n1\u20132; Ten 1987; Primoratz 1999, chs. 2\u20133; Boonin 2008: ch.\n2).\n\nThere are some equally familiar consequentialist responses to this\nobjection. One is to argue that such \u2018unjust\u2019punishments\nwould be justified if they would really produce the best\nconsequences (see e.g., Smart 1973: 69\u201372; Bagaric and\nAmarasekara 2000) \u2014 to which the critic will reply that we\ncannot thus put aside the moral significance of injustice. Another is\nto argue that in the real world it is extremely unlikely that such\npunishments would ever be for the best, and even less likely that the\nagents involved could be trusted reliably to pick out those rare cases\nin which they would be: thus we, and especially our penal officials,\nwill do best if we think and act as if such punishments are\nintrinsically wrong and unjustifiable (see e.g., Rawls 1955; Hare\n1981, chs. 3, 9.7) \u2014 to which the critic will respond that this\nstill makes the wrongness of punishing a known innocent contingent on\nits effects, and fails to recognise the intrinsic wrong that such\npunishment does (see e.g., Duff 1986: 151\u201364; Primoratz 1999,\nchs. 3.3, 6.5). Another response is to argue that a richer or subtler\naccount of the ends that the criminal law should serve will generate\nsuitable protection against unjust punishments (see Braithwaite and\nPettit 1990, especially 71\u201376, on \u2018dominion\u2019 as the\nend of criminal law); but the objection remains that any purely\nconsequentialist account will make the protection of the innocent\nagainst injustice contingent on its instrumental contribution to the\nsystem\u2019s aims (on Braithwaite and Pettit, see von Hirsch and\nAshworth 1992; Duff 1996: 20\u201325; Pettit 1997).\n\nAnother objection to consequentialist accounts focuses not on\npotential wrongs done to the innocent but rather on the wrong\nallegedly done to the guilty. Consequentialist punishment, on this\nobjection, fails to respect the person punished as an autonomous moral\nagent. In Kantian terms, such punishment treats those punished as mere\nmeans to achieving some social good, rather than respecting them as\nends in themselves (Kant 1797: 473; Murphy 1973). The Kantian\nprohibition on treating each other \u2018merely as means\u2019 is\nadmittedly unclear in its implications (for a useful discussion of how\nwe should understand \u2018the means principle\u2019, see Tadros\n2011: ch. 6). One might argue that if punishment is reserved for those\nwho voluntarily break the law, it does not treat them merely\nas means. Indeed, Kant himself suggested that as long as we\nreserve punishment only for those found guilty of crimes, then it is\npermissible to punish with an eye toward potential benefits (Kant\n1797: 473). As we have seen, though, insofar as such an approach\nrelies on endorsing prohibitions on punishment of the innocent or\ndisproportionate punishment of the guilty, the challenge remains that\nsuch constraints appear to be merely contingent if grounded in\nconsequentialist considerations. Conversely, if the constraints are\nmore than merely contingent, it appears that they will be based on\nsome deontological considerations, in which case the overall theory\nwill no longer be purely consequentialist, but rather a mixed theory\n(see s. 6).\n\nA more recent objection (Duff 2011: 75\u201379) charges that\nconsequentialist systems of punishment are inappropriately\nexclusionary insofar as they treat offenders as dangerous\n\u2018outsiders\u2019 who must be threatened, incapacitated, or\nreformed to ensure the safety of the law-abiding members of society.\nThe criminal law, and the institution of punishment, in a liberal\nsociety should treat offenders as (still) members of the polity who\ndespite having violated its values could, and should, nonetheless\n(re)commit to these values. A possible response is that a penal system\naimed at crime reduction through deterrence need not be exclusionary,\nas it treats all community members equally, namely as potential\noffenders (Hoskins 2011a: 379\u201381). Also, insofar as such a\nsystem \u2018promotes social cooperation under stable public\ninstitutions\u2019, it thus helps to protect the freedom of everyone\n(Chiao 2018: 36).\n4. Retributivist Accounts\n\nWhereas consequentialist accounts regard punishment as justified\ninstrumentally, as a means to achieving some valuable goal (typically\ncrime reduction), retributivist accounts contend that punishment is\njustified as an intrinsically appropriate, because deserved, response\nto wrongdoing (but see Berman 2011 for an argument that some recent\nversions of retributivism actually turn it into a consequentialist\ntheory).\n\nTheorists have distinguished \u2018positive\u2019 and\n\u2018negative\u2019 forms of retributivism. Positive retributivism\nholds that an offender\u2019s desert provides a reason in favour of\npunishment; essentially, the state should punish those found guilty of\ncriminal offences to the extent that they deserve, because they\ndeserve it. Penal desert constitutes not just a necessary, but an\nin-principle sufficient reason for punishment (only in principle,\nhowever, since there are good reasons \u2014 to do with the costs,\nboth material and moral, of punishment \u2014 why we should not even\ntry to punish all the guilty). Negative retributivism, by contrast,\nprovides not a positive reason to punish, but rather a constraint on\npunishment: punishment should be imposed only on those who deserve it,\nand only in proportion with their desert. Because negative\nretributivism represents only a constraining principle, not a positive\nreason to punish, it has been employed in various mixed accounts of\npunishment, which endorse punishment for consequentialist reasons but\nonly insofar as the punishment is no more than is deserved (see s. 6\nbelow).\n\nA striking feature of penal theorising during the last three decades\nof the twentieth century was a revival of positive retributivism\n\u2014 of the idea that the positive justification of punishment is\nto be found in its intrinsic character as a deserved response to crime\n(see H. Morris 1968; N. Morris 1974; Murphy 1973; von Hirsch 1976; two\nuseful collections of contemporary papers on retributivism are White\n2011 and Tonry 2012).\n\nPositive retributivism comes in very different forms (Cottingham\n1979). All can be understood, however, as attempting to answer the two\ncentral questions faced by any retributivist theory of punishment.\nFirst, what is the justificatory relationship between crime and\npunishment that the idea of desert is supposed to capture: why do the\nguilty \u2018deserve to suffer\u2019 (see L. Davis 1972) \u2014 and\nwhat do they deserve to suffer (see Ardal 1984; Honderich 2005, ch.\n2)? Second, even if they deserve to suffer, or to be burdened in some\ndistinctive way, why should it be for the state to inflict that\nsuffering or that burden on them through a system of criminal\npunishment (Murphy 1985; Husak 1992 and 2015; Shafer-Landau 1996;\nWellman 2009)?\n\nOne retributivist answer to these questions is that crime involves\ntaking an unfair advantage over the law-abiding, and that punishment\nremoves that unfair advantage. The criminal law benefits all citizens\nby protecting them from certain kinds of harm: but this benefit\ndepends upon citizens accepting the burden of self-restraint involved\nin obeying the law. The criminal takes the benefit of the\nself-restraint of others but refuses to accept that burden herself:\nshe has gained an unfair advantage, which punishment removes by\nimposing some additional burden on her (see H. Morris 1968; Murphy\n1973; Sadurski 1985; Sher 1987, ch. 5; Adler 1992, chs. 5\u20138;\nDagger 1993, 2008, 2011; Stichter 2010; Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2017; for\ncriticism, see Burgh 1982; Duff 1986, ch. 8; Falls 1987; Dolinko 1991;\nAnderson 1997; Boonin 2008: 119\u2013143; Hoskins 2011b).\n\nThis kind of account does indeed answer the two questions noted above.\nWhat the criminal deserves to suffer is the loss of her unfair\nadvantage, and she deserves that because it is unfair that she should\nget away with taking the benefits of the law without accepting the\nburdens on which those benefits depend; it is the state\u2019s job to\ninflict this suffering on her, because it is the author or guarantor\nof the criminal law. However, such accounts have internal\ndifficulties: for instance, how are we to determine how great was the\nunfair advantage gained by a crime; how far are such measurements of\nunfair advantage likely to correlate with our judgements of the\nseriousness of crimes? (For a detailed defence of the \u2018unfair\nadvantage\u2019 theory as a theory of sentencing, see M. Davis 1992,\n1996; for criticism, see Scheid 1990, 1995; von Hirsch 1990.)\nFurthermore, they seem to misrepresent what it is about crime that\nmakes it deserving of punishment: what makes murder, or rape, or\ntheft, or assault a criminal wrong, deserving of punishment, is surely\nthe wrongful harm that it does to the individual victim \u2014 not\n(as on this kind of account) the supposed unfair advantage that the\ncriminal takes over all those who obey the law (for recent attempts to\ndefend fair play retributivism against these objections, see Stichter\n2010 and Duus-Otterstr\u00f6m 2017).\n\nA different retributivist account appeals not to the abstract notion\nof unfair advantage, but to our (normal, appropriate) emotional\nresponses to crime: for instance, to the resentment or\n\u2018retributive hatred\u2019, involving a desire to make the\nwrongdoer suffer, that crime may arouse (see Murphy and Hampton 1988,\nchs. 1, 3); or to the guilt, involving the judgement that I ought to\nbe punished, that my own wrongdoing would arouse in me (see Moore\n1997, ch. 4). Such accounts try to answer the first of the two\nquestions noted above: crime deserves punishment in the sense that it\nmakes appropriate certain emotions (resentment, guilt) which are\nsatisfied by or expressed in punishment. They do not yet show,\nhowever, why it should be the state\u2019s task to satisfy or provide\nformal expression for such emotions (but see Stephen 1873: 152); and\ntheir answers to the first question are also problematic. Criminal\nwrongdoing should, we can agree, provoke certain kinds of emotion,\nsuch as self-directed guilt and other-directed indignation; and such\nemotions might typically involve a desire to make those at whom they\nare directed suffer. But just as we can agree that anger is an\nappropriate response to wrongs done to me, while also arguing that we\nshould resist the desire to hit back that anger often, even typically,\ninvolves (see Horder 1992:194\u20137), so we could argue that\nalthough guilt, resentment and indignation are appropriate responses\nto our own and others\u2019 wrongdoing, we should resist the desire\nfor suffering that they so often involve. At the least we need to know\nmore than we are told by these accounts about just what wrongdoers\ndeserve to suffer, and why the infliction of suffering should be an\nappropriate way to express such proper emotions. (For critical\ndiscussions of Murphy, see Murphy and Hampton 1988, ch. 2; Duff 1996:\n29\u201331; Murphy 1999. On Moore, see Dolinko 1991: 555\u20139;\nKnowles 1993; Murphy 1999. See also Murphy 2003, 2012.)\n\nMore recently, critics of emotion-based retributivist accounts have\ncontended that the emotions on which retributive (and other\ndeontological) intuitions are based have evolved as mechanisms to\nstabilise cooperation; given that we have retributive emotions only\nbecause of their evolutionary fitness, it would be merely a\ncoincidence if intuitions based on these emotions happened to track\nmoral truths about, e.g., desert (see especially Greene 2008; also\nSinger 2005). A problem with such accounts is that they appear to\nprove too much: consequentialist accounts also rely on certain\nevaluation intuitions (about what has value, or about the proper way\nto respond to that which we value); insofar as such intuitions are\nnaturally selected, then it would be no less coincidental if they\ntracked moral truths than if retributive intuitions did so. Thus the\nconsequentialist accounts that derive from these intuitions would be\nsimilarly undermined by this evolutionary argument (see Kahane 2011;\nMason 2011; but see Wiegman 2017).\n\nA third version of retributivism holds that when people commit a\ncrime, they thereby incur a moral debt to their victims, and\npunishment is deserved as a way to pay this debt (McDermott 2001).\nThis moral debt differs from the material debt that an offender may\nincur, and thus payment of the material debt (returning stolen money\nor property, etc.) does not settle the moral debt: punishment is\nneeded to pay the moral debt, by denying the ill-gotten moral good to\nthe perpetrator. Among the challenges for this account are to explain\nthe nature of the moral good, how the offender takes this moral good\nfrom the victim, how punishment denies this good to the offender, and\nhow doing so thereby pays the offender\u2019s debt to the victim.\n5. Punishment as Communication\n\nPerhaps the most influential version of retributivism in recent\ndecades seeks the meaning and justification of punishment as a\ndeserved response to crime in its expressive or communicative\ncharacter. (On the expressive dimension of punishment, see generally\nFeinberg 1970; Primoratz 1989; for critical discussion, see Hart 1963:\n60\u201369; Skillen 1980; M. Davis 1996: 169\u201381; A. Lee 2019.)\nConsequentialists can of course portray punishment as useful partly in\nvirtue of its expressive character (see Ewing 1927; Lacey 1988;\nBraithwaite and Pettit 1990); but a portrayal of punishment as a mode\nof deserved moral communication has been central to many recent\nversions of retributivism.\n\nThe central meaning and purpose of punishment, on such accounts, is to\nconvey the censure or condemnation that offenders deserve for their\ncrimes. On some versions of this type of theory, punishment serves to\nexpress to the community generally (including the offender and victim)\nthe society\u2019s denunciation of or dissociation from the crime\n(see Bennett 2008; Wringe 2016). On other such accounts, the primary\nintended audience of the condemnatory message is the offender himself,\nalthough the broader society may be a secondary audience (see Duff\n2001: secs. 1.4.4, 3.2; Markel 2011).\n\nOnce we recognise that punishment can serve this communicative\npurpose, we can see how such accounts begin to answer the two\nquestions that retributivists face. First, there is an obviously\nintelligible justificatory relationship between wrongdoing and\ncondemnation: whatever puzzles there might be about other attempts to\nexplain the idea of penal desert, the idea that it is appropriate to\ncondemn wrongdoing is surely unpuzzling. Second, it is appropriate for\nthe state to ensure that such censure is formally administered through\nthe criminal justice system: if crimes are public wrongs, breaches of\nthe political community\u2019s authoritative code, then they merit\npublic censure by the community. (For other examples of communicative\naccounts, see especially von Hirsch 1993: ch.2; Markel 2012. For\ncritical discussion, see M. Davis 1991; Boonin 2008: 171\u201380;\nHanna 2008; Matravers 2011a.)\n\nTwo crucial lines of objection face any such justification of\npunishment as a communicative enterprise. The first line of critique\nholds that, whether the primary intended audience is the offender or\nthe community generally, condemnation of a crime can be communicated\nthrough a formal conviction in a criminal court; or it could be\ncommunicated by some further formal denunciation issued by a judge or\nsome other representative of the legal community, or by a system of\npurely symbolic punishments which were burdensome only in virtue of\ntheir censorial meaning. It can, of course, also be communicated by\n\u2018hard treatment\u2019 punishments of the kinds imposed by our\ncourts \u2014 by imprisonment, by compulsory community service, by\nfines and the like, which are burdensome independently of their\ncensorial meaning (on \u2018hard treatment\u2019, see Feinberg\n1970): but why should we choose such methods of communication, rather\nthan methods that do not involve hard treatment (see Christie 1981:\n98\u2013105; Boonin 2008: 176\u201379; Hanna 2008; K\u00f6nigs 2013;\nTadros 2011: 103)? Is it because they will make the communication more\neffective (see Falls 1987; Primoratz 1989; Kleinig 1991)? But one\nmight think that an account that relies on punishment\u2019s\ncontingent effectiveness in communicating the desired message begins\nto look more like the sort of consequentialist account of which\nretributivists are critical (but see Glasgow 2015: 611\u201320). And\nanyway, one might worry that the hard treatment will conceal, rather\nthan highlight, the moral censure it should communicate (see Mathiesen\n1990: 58\u201373).\n\nOne sort of answer to this first line of critique explains penal hard\ntreatment as an essential aspect of the enterprise of moral\ncommunication itself. Punishment, on this view, should aim not merely\nto communicate censure to the offender, but to persuade the offender\nto recognise and repent the wrong he has done, and so to recognise the\nneed to reform himself and his future conduct, and to make apologetic\nreparation to those whom he wronged. His punishment then constitutes a\nkind of secular penance that he is required to undergo for his crime:\nits hard treatment aspects, the burden it imposes on him, should serve\nboth to assist the process of repentance and reform, by focusing his\nattention on his crime and its implications, and as a way of making\nthe apologetic reparation that he owes (see Duff 2001, 2011b; see also\nGarvey 1999, 2003; Tudor 2001; Brownless 2007; Hus 2015; for a\nsophisticated discussion see Tasioulas 2006). This type of account\nfaces serious objections (see Bickenbach 1988; Ten 1990; von Hirsch\n1999; Bagaric and Amarasekara 2000; Ciocchetti 2004; von Hirsch and\nAshworth 2005: ch. 7; Bennett 2006, 2015): in particular that it\ncannot show penal hard treatment to be a necessary aspect of a\ncommunicative enterprise which is still to respect offenders as\nresponsible and rational agents who must be left free to remain\nunpersuaded; that apologetic reparation must be voluntary if it is to\nbe of any real value; and that a liberal state should not take this\nkind of intrusive interest in its citizens\u2019 moral\ncharacters.\n\nThe second line of objection to communicative versions of\nretributivism \u2014 and indeed against retributivism generally\n\u2014 charges that the notions of desert and blame at the heart of\nretributivist accounts are misplaced and pernicious. One version of\nthis objection is grounded in scepticism about free will. Free will\nscepticism holds that people\u2019s behaviour is the product of\ndeterminism, luck, or chance, and thus that we are not morally\nresponsible for our behaviour in the respects that would justify the\nideas that those who commit crimes are blameworthy and\ndeserve punishment (see Pereboom 2013; Caruso 2018). In\nresponse, retributivists may point out that only if punishment is\ngrounded in desert can we provide more than contingent assurances\nagainst punishment of the innocent or disproportionate punishment of\nthe guilty, or assurances against treating those punished as mere\nmeans to whatever desirable social ends (see s. 3 above; but see\nVilhauer 2013).\n\nAnother version of the objection is not grounded in free will\nscepticism: it allows that people may sometimes merit a judgement of\nblameworthiness. But it contends that the \u2018affective\u2019\naspect of blame \u2014 its realisation in negative reactive attitudes\nsuch as anger, hatred, and contempt \u2014 has pernicious effects\nwhen manifested in the criminal law: such emotion-laden blame fosters\nall-encompassing condemnations of offenders, rather than condemnation\nmerely of their crimes; and it has contributed to overcriminalisation,\noverly harsh sentencing, and mass incarceration. On this line of\nobjection, the state\u2019s response to crimes should focus not on\nretribution but on rehabilitation, treating offenders as morally\nresponsible agents but not blaming them (see Lacey and Pickard 2013,\n2015, 2018, 2021; for similar accounts, see Kelly 2018; Nussbaum 2016:\nch. 6).\n\nTo this second version of the objection to retributivist blame,\nretributivists may respond that although emotions associated with\nretributive blame have no doubt contributed to various excesses in\npenal policy, this is not to say that the notion of deserved censure\ncan have no appropriate place in a suitably reformed penal system.\nAfter all, when properly focused and proportionate, reactive attitudes\nsuch as anger may play an important role by focusing our attention on\nwrongdoing and motivating us to stand up to it; anger-tinged blame may\nalso serve to convey how seriously we take the wrongdoing, and thus to\ndemonstrate respect for its victims as well as its perpetrators (see\nCogley 2014; Hoskins 2020). What\u2019s more, on the sort of\ncommunicative retributivist account sketched above, treating offenders\nas responsible agents involves pointing out when they have done wrong\nand expecting them to take responsibility for their wrongful actions.\nIf taking responsibility for one\u2019s wrongdoing requires that one\nacknowledge it as wrongdoing, commit to reforming one's behaviour, and\nbegin to reconcile with one\u2019s community by making reparation for\nthe wrongdoing, then one might argue that emotions associated with\nself-blame (guilt, remorse) and others\u2019 blame (anger,\nresentment) play a central role in such a process.\n6. Mixed Accounts\n\nGiven the challenges faced by pure consequentialist and pure\nretributivist accounts, some theorists have sought to make progress on\nthe question of punishment\u2019s justification by incorporating\nconsequentialist and nonconsequentialist elements into their\naccounts.\n\nPerhaps the most influential example of a mixed account begins by\nrecognizing that the question of punishment\u2019s justification is\nin fact several different questions, which may be answered by appeal\nto different considerations. In particular, Hart (1968: 9\u201310)\npointed out that we may ask about punishment, as about any social\ninstitution, what compelling rationale there is to maintain the\ninstitution (that is, what values or aims it fosters) and also what\nconsiderations should govern the institution. The compelling rationale\nwill itself entail certain constraints: e.g., the rationale of\ndeterrence would rule out punishments that had no deterrent effect or,\nworse, tended to exacerbate crime levels. What distinguishes hybrid\ntheories such as Hart\u2019s, however, is the claim that there may be\nconstraining considerations that do not flow from punishment\u2019s\nrationale. On Hart\u2019s account, the compelling rationale for\npunishment (what he termed its \u2018general justifying aim\u2019)\nlies in its beneficial effects, but our pursuit of that aim must be\nconstrained by nonconsequentialist principles that preclude the kinds\nof injustice alleged to flow from a purely consequentialist account:\nprinciples that forbid, for instance, the deliberate punishment of the\ninnocent, or the excessively harsh punishment of the guilty. (See most\nfamously Hart 1968, and Scheid 1997 for a sophisticated Hartian\ntheory; on Hart, see Lacey 1988: 46\u201356; Morison 1988; Primoratz\n1999: ch. 6.6.)\n\nAlthough analysis of \u2018the hybrid theory\u2019 of punishment has\ntended to focus on Hart\u2019s version of it, one might endorse\nhybrid views that vary significantly from Hart\u2019s. For example,\nwhereas Hart endorsed a consequentialist rationale for punishment and\nnonconsequentialist side-constraints, one might instead endorse a\nretributivist rationale constrained by consequentialist considerations\n(punishment should not tend to exacerbate crime, or undermine offender\nreform, etc.), or constrained by nonconsequentialist (but not\nretributivist) considerations such as human rights or respect for\npersons. Alternatively, one might endorse an account on which both\nconsequentialist and retributivist considerations features as\nrationales but for different branches of the law: on such an account,\nthe legislature determines crimes and establishes sentencing ranges\nwith the aim of crime reduction, but the judiciary makes sentencing\ndecisions based on retributivist considerations of desert (M. C.\nAltman 2021; Rawls\u2019s account (1955) has also been characterised\nas a hybrid view of this sort, but in fact it is a version of rule\nutilitarianism; on the variety of hybrid views, see Hoskins 2021).\n\nCritics have charged that hybrid accounts are ad hoc or internally\ninconsistent (see Kaufman 2008: 45-49). In addition, retributivists\nargue that hybrid views that integrate consequentialist rationales\nwith retributivist side-constraints thereby relegate retributivism to\na merely subsidiary role, when in fact giving offenders their just\ndeserts is a (or the) central rationale for punishment (see Wood 2002:\n303).\n\nAlso, because hybrid accounts incorporate consequentialist and\nretributivist elements, they may be subject to some of the same\nobjections raised against pure versions of consequentialism or\nretributivism. For example, insofar as they endorse retributivist\nconstraints on punishment, they face the thorny problem of explaining\nthe retributivist notion of desert (see s. 4 above): but it is not\nclear whether they can be justified without such an appeal to\nretributivist desert (see Hart 1968: 44\u201348; Feinberg 1988:\n144\u201355; Walker 1991, ch. 11). Even if such side-constraints can\nbe securely grounded, however, consequentialist theories of punishment\nface the broadly Kantian line of objection discussed earlier (s. 3),\nthat punishing with the aim of serving some desirable social ends\ntreats those punished merely as means to those further ends, which\ndenies them the respect, the moral standing, that is their due as\nresponsible agents.\n\nSome have contended that punishment with a consequentialist rationale\ndoes not treat those punished merely as means as long as it is\nconstrained by the retributivist prohibitions on punishment of the\ninnocent and disproportionate punishment of the guilty (see Walker\n1980: 80\u201385; Hoskins 2011a). Still, a critic may argue that if\nwe are to treat another with the respect due to her as a rational and\nresponsible agent, we must seek to modify her conduct only by offering\nher good and relevant reasons to modify it for herself. Punishment\naimed at deterrence, incapacitation, or offender reform, however, does\nnot satisfy that demand. A reformative system treats those subjected\nto it not as rational, self-determining agents, but as objects to be\nre-formed by whatever efficient (and humane) techniques we can find.\nAn incapacitative system does not leave those subjected to it free, as\nresponsible agents should be left free, to determine their own future\nconduct, but seeks to preempt their future choices by incapacitating\nthem. And although a deterrent system does, unlike the others, offer\npotential offenders reason to obey the law, it offers them the wrong\nkind of reason: instead of addressing them as responsible moral\nagents, in terms of the moral reasons which justify the law\u2019s\ndemands on them, it addresses them as merely self-interested beings,\nin the coercive language of threat; deterrence treats \u2018a man\nlike a dog instead of with the freedom and respect due to him as a\nman\u2019 (Hegel 1821: 246. For these objections, see Lewis 1953; H\nMorris 1968; Duff 1986: 178\u201386; von Hirsch 1993: 9\u201314; von\nHirsch and Ashworth 1998, chs. 1, 3).\n\nOne strategy for dealing with them is to posit a two-step\njustification of punishment. The first step, which typically appeals\nto nonconsequentialist values, shows how the commission of a crime\nrenders the offender eligible for, or liable to, the kinds of coercive\ntreatment that punishment involves: such treatment, which is normally\ninconsistent with the respect due to us as rational agents or as\ncitizens, and inconsistent with the Kantian means principle, is\nrendered permissible by the commission of the offence. The second step\nis then to offer positive consequentialist reasons for imposing\npunishment on those who are eligible for it or liable to it: we should\npunish if and because this can be expected to produce sufficient\nconsequential benefits to outweigh its undoubted costs. (Further\nnonconsequentialist constraints might also be placed on the severity\nand modes of punishment that can be permitted: constraints either\nflowing from an account of just what offenders render themselves\nliable to, or from other values external to the system of\npunishment.)\n\nThus, for instance, some argue that those who voluntarily break the\nlaw thereby forfeit at least some of the rights that citizens can\nnormally claim: their wrongdoing therefore legitimises kinds of\ntreatment (reformative or incapacitative treatment, for instance, or\ndeterrent punishment) that would normally be wrong as violating\ncitizens\u2019 rights (see Goldman 1982; C Morris 1991; Wellman 2012;\nfor criticisms, see Lippke 2001a; Boonin 2008: 103\u201319). We must\nask, however, whether we should be so quick to exclude fellow citizens\nfrom the rights and status of citizenship, or whether we should not\nlook for an account of punishment (if it is to be justified at all) on\nwhich punishment can still be claimed to treat those punished as full\ncitizens. (The common practice of denying imprisoned offenders the\nright to vote while they are in prison, and perhaps even after they\nleave prison, is symbolically significant in this context: those who\nwould argue that punishment should be consistent with recognised\ncitizenship should also oppose such practices; see Lippke 2001b;\nJournal of Applied Philosophy 2005; see also generally s.\n9.)\n\nAnother view holds that punishment does not violate offenders\u2019\nrights insofar as they consent to their punishment (see Nino 1983).\nThe consent view holds that when a person voluntarily commits a crime\nwhile knowing the consequences of doing so, she thereby consents to\nthese consequences. This is not to say that she explicitly\nconsents to being punished, but rather than by her voluntary action\nshe tacitly consents to be subject to what she knows are the\nconsequences. Notice that, like the forfeiture view, the consent view\nis agnostic regarding the positive aim of punishment: it purports to\ntell us only that punishing the person does not wrong her, as she has\neffectively waived her right against such treatment. The consent view\nfaces formidable objections, however. First, it appears unable to\nground prohibitions on excessively harsh sentences: if such sentences\nare implemented, then anyone who subsequently violates the\ncorresponding laws will have apparently tacitly consented to the\npunishment (Alexander 1986). A second objection is that most offenders\ndo not in fact consent, even tacitly, to their sentences, because they\nare unaware either that their acts are subject to punishment or of the\nseverity of the punishment to which they may be liable. For someone to\nhave consented to be subject to certain consequences of an act, she\nmust know of these consequences (see Boonin 2008: 161\u201364). A\nthird objection is that, because tacit consent can be overridden by\nexplicit denial of consent, it appears that explicitly nonconsenting\noffenders could not be justifiably punished on this view (ibid.:\n164\u2013165; but see Imbrisevic 2010).\n\nOthers offer contractualist or contractarian justifications of\npunishment, grounded in an account not of what treatment offenders\nhave in fact tacitly consented to, but rather of what rational agents\nor reasonable citizens would endorse. The punishment of those who\ncommit crimes is then, it is argued, rendered permissible by the fact\nthat the offender himself would, as a rational agent or reasonable\ncitizen, have consented to a system of law that provided for such\npunishments (see e.g., Dolovich 2004; Brettschneider 2007; Finkelstein\n2011; for criticism, see Dagger 2011; see also Matravers 2000). Still\nothers portray punishment (in particular deterrent punishment) as a\nspecies of societal (self-) defence \u2014 and it seems clear that to\ndefend oneself against a wrongful attack is not to use the attacker\n\u2018merely as a means\u2019, or to fail to show him the respect\nthat is his due. (For versions of this kind of argument, see Alexander\n1980; Quinn 1985; Farrell 1985, 1995; Montague 1995; Ellis 2003 and\n2012. For criticism, see Boonin 2008: 192\u2013207. For a\nparticularly intricate development of this line of thought, grounding\nthe justification of punishment in the duties that we incur by\ncommitting wrongs, see Tadros 2011; for critical responses, see the\nspecial issue of Law and Philosophy, 2013.)\n\nOne might argue that the Hegelian objection to a system of deterrent\npunishment overstates the tension between the types of reasons, moral\nor prudential, that such a system may offer. Punishment may\ncommunicate both a prudential and a moral message to members of the\ncommunity. Even before a crime is committed, the threat of punishment\ncommunicates societal condemnation of an offense. This moral message\nmay help to dissuade potential offenders, but those who are\nunpersuaded by this moral message may still be prudentially deterred\nby the prospect of punishment. Similarly, those who actually do commit\ncrimes may be dissuaded from reoffending by the moral censure conveyed\nby their punishment, or else by the prudential desire to avoid another\nround of hard treatment. What\u2019s more, even if punishment itself\ndid provide solely prudential reasons not to commit crimes,\nthe criminal legal system more generally may communicate with citizens\nin moral terms. Through its criminal statutes, a community declares\ncertain acts to be wrong and makes a moral appeal to community members\nto comply, whereas trials and convictions can communicate a message of\ndeserved censure to the offender. Thus even if a system of deterrent\npunishment is itself regarded as communicating solely in prudential\nterms, it seems that the criminal law more generally can still\ncommunicate a moral message to those subject to it (see Hoskins\n2011a).\n\nA somewhat different attempt to accommodate prudential as well as\nmoral reasons in an account of punishment begins with the\nretributivist notion that punishment is justified as a form of\ndeserved censure, but then contends that we should communicate censure\nthrough penal hard treatment because this will give those who are\ninsufficiently impressed by the moral appeal of censure prudential\nreason to refrain from crime; because, that is, the prospect of such\npunishment might deter those who are not susceptible to moral\npersuasion. (See Lipkin 1988, Baker 1992. For a sophisticated revision\nof this idea, which makes deterrence firmly secondary to censure, see\nvon Hirsch 1993, ch. 2; Narayan 1993. For critical discussion, see\nBottoms 1998; Duff 2001, ch. 3.3. For another subtle version of this\nkind of account, see Matravers 2000.) This kind of account differs\nfrom the accounts just discussed, on which retributivist prohibitions\non punishment of the innocent or excessive punishment of the guilty\nconstrain the pursuit of consequentialist aims, since in the current\naccount the (retributivist) imposition of deserved censure is part of\nthe positive justifying aim of punishment; and it can claim, in\nresponse to the Hegelian objection to deterrence, that it does not\naddress potential offenders merely \u2018like dogs\u2019, since the\nlaw\u2019s initial appeal to the citizen is in the appropriate moral\nterms: the prudential, coercive reasons constituted by penal hard\ntreatment as deterrence are relevant only to those who are deaf, or at\nleast insufficiently attentive, to the law\u2019s moral appeal. It\nmight be objected that on this account the law, in speaking to those\nwho are not persuaded by its moral appeal, is still abandoning the\nattempt at moral communication in favour of the language of threats,\nand thus ceasing to address its citizens as responsible moral agents:\nto which it might be replied, first, that the law is addressing us,\nappropriately, as fallible moral agents who know that we need the\nadditional spur of prudential deterrence to persuade us to act as we\nshould; and second, that we cannot clearly separate the (merely)\ndeterrent from the morally communicative dimensions of punishment\n\u2014 that the dissuasive efficacy of legitimate punishment still\ndepends crucially on the moral meaning that the hard treatment is\nunderstood to convey.\n\nOne more mixed view worth noting holds that punishment is justified as\na means of teaching a moral lesson to those who commit crimes, and\nperhaps to community members more generally (the seminal articulations\nof this view are H. Morris 1981 and Hampton 1984; for a more recent\naccount, see Demetriou 2012; for criticism, see Deigh 1984,\nShafer-Landau 1991). Like standard consequentialist accounts, the\nmoral education view acknowledges that punishment\u2019s role in\nreducing crime is a central part of its rationale (see, e.g., Hampton\n1984: 211). But education theorists also take seriously the Hegelian\nworry discussed earlier; they view punishment not as a means of\nconditioning people to behave in certain ways, but rather as a means\nof teaching them that what they have done should not be done because\nit is morally wrong. Thus although the education view sets offender\nreform as an end, it also implies certain nonconsequentialist\nconstraints on how we may appropriately pursue this end. Another\ndistinctive feature of the moral education view is that it conceives\nof punishment as aiming to confer a benefit on the offender: the\nbenefit of moral education. Critics have objected to the moral\neducation view on various grounds, however. Some are sceptical about\nwhether punishment is the most effective means of moral education.\nOthers deny that most offenders need moral education; many offenders\nrealise what they are doing is wrong but are weak-willed, impulsive,\netc. Also, may liberal theorists object that the education view is\ninappropriately paternalistic in that it endorses coercively\nrestricting offenders\u2019 liberties as a means to confer a benefit\non them.\n\nEach of the theories discussed in this section incorporates, in\nvarious ways, consequentialist and nonconsequentialist elements.\nWhether any of these is more plausible than pure consequentialist or\npure retributivist alternatives is, not surprisingly, a matter of\nongoing philosophical debate. One possibility, of course, is that none\nof the theories on offer is successful because punishment is,\nultimately, unjustifiable. The next section considers penal\nabolitionism.\n7. Abolition and Alternatives\n\nAbolitionist theorising about punishment takes many different forms,\nunited only by the insistence that we should seek to abolish, rather\nthan merely to reform, our practices of punishment. (Classic\nabolitionist texts include Christie 1977, 1981; Hulsman 1986, 1991; de\nHaan 1990; Bianchi 1994.) An initial question is precisely what\npractices should be abolished. Some abolitionists focus on particular\nmodes of punishment, such as capital punishment (see, e.g., Brooks\n2004; Yost 2019) or imprisonment (see, e.g., A. Y. Davis 2003).\nWhat\u2019s more, a prominent strand of abolitionism focuses on\nincarceration as practiced in the U.S. context, with links drawn\nbetween imprisonment and the American legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, and\nsegregation (see, e.g., Adelsberg et. al. 2015; McLeod 2019; Roberts\n2019). Insofar as such critiques are grounded in concerns about racial\ndisparities, mass incarceration, police abuses, and other features of\nthe U.S. criminal justice system, they may have implications for other\nU.S. criminal justice practices in addition to incarceration. At the\nsame time, insofar as the critiques are based on particular features\nof the U.S. system, it may be less clear what implications they have\nfor imprisonment as it is implemented in other polities. By contrast,\nother abolitionist accounts focus not on some particular mode(s) of\npunishment, or on a particular mode of punishment as administered in\nthis or that legal system, but rather on criminal punishment in any\nform (see, e.g., Golash 2005; Boonin 2008; Zimmerman 2011). It is\nimportant to be clear about the target of critique: to endorse the\nabolition of imprisonment, or even of criminal punishment in any form,\nas it is currently practiced allows for the possibility that a\nsuitably reformed system of imprisonment or punishment in some other\nform could be justified (and here it may be difficult, as with\nTheseus's ship, to distinguish between radically rebuilding an\nexisting practice and abolishing it in favour of an alternative\npractice).\n\nThe more powerful abolitionist challenge is that punishment cannot be\njustified even in principle. After all, when the state imposes\npunishment, it treats some people in ways that would typically\n(outside the context of punishment) be impermissible. It subjects them\nto intentionally burdensome treatment and to the condemnation of the\ncommunity. Abolitionists find that the various attempted\njustifications of this intentionally burdensome condemnatory treatment\nfail, and thus that the practice is morally wrong \u2014 not merely\nin practice but in principle. For such accounts, a central question is\nhow the state should respond to the types of conduct for which one\ncurrently would be subject to punishment. In this section we attend to\nthree notable types of abolitionist theory and the alternatives to\npunishment that they endorse.\n\nMost prominently, many abolitionists look to \u2018restorative\njustice\u2019 as an alternative to punishment.\n(\u2018Restorative\u2019 practices and programmes also play an\nincreasingly significant, although still somewhat marginal, role\nwithin the criminal process of trial and punishment; but our\nconcern here is with restorative justice as an alternative to\npunishment.) The restorative justice movement has been growing in\nstrength: although there are different and conflicting conceptions of\nwhat \u2018restorative justice\u2019 means or involves, one central\ntheme is that what crime makes necessary is a process of reparation or\nrestoration between offender, victim, and other interested parties;\nand that this is achieved not through a criminal process of trial and\npunishment, but through mediation or reconciliation programmes that\nbring together the victim, offender and other interested parties to\ndiscuss what was done and how to deal with it (see generally Matthews\n1988; Daly and Immarigeon 1998; von Hirsch and Ashworth 1998, ch. 7;\nBraithwaite 1999; Walgrave 2002; von Hirsch et al 2003; von Hirsch,\nAshworth and Shearing 2005; London 2011; Johnstone 2011, 2012).\n\nAdvocates of restorative justice often contrast it with\n\u2018retributive\u2019 justice; they argue that we should look for\nrestoration rather than retribution or punishment, and seek to repair\nharms caused rather than to inflict punitive suffering for wrongs\ndone. But one might regard this as a false dichotomy (see Allais 2011;\nDuff 2011a). For when we ask what it is that requires\n\u2018restoration\u2019 or repair, the answer must refer not only to\nwhatever material harm was caused by the crime, but to the wrong that\nwas done: that was what fractured the relationship between offender\nand victim (and the broader community), and that is what must be\nrecognised and \u2018repaired\u2019 or made up for if a genuine\nreconciliation is to be achieved. A restorative process that is to be\nappropriate to crime must therefore be one that seeks an adequate\nrecognition, by the offender and by others, of the wrong done\u2014a\nrecognition that must for the offender, if genuine, be repentant; and\nthat seeks an appropriate apologetic reparation for that wrong from\nthe offender. But those are also the aims of punishment as a species\nof secular penance, as sketched above. A system of criminal\npunishment, however improved it might be, is of course not well\ndesigned to bring about the kind of personal reconciliations and\ntransformations that advocates of restorative justice sometimes seek;\nbut it could be apt to secure the kind of formal, ritualised\nreconciliation that is the most that a liberal state should try to\nsecure between its citizens. If we focus only on imprisonment, which\nis still often the preferred mode of punishment in many penal systems,\nthis suggestion will appear laughable; but if we think instead of\npunishments such as Community Service Orders (now part of what is\ncalled Community Payback) or probation, it might seem more\nplausible.\n\nThis argument does not, of course, support that account of punishment\nagainst its critics. What it might suggest, however, is that although\nwe can learn much from the restorative justice movement, especially\nabout the role that processes of mediation and reparation can play in\nour responses to crime, its aim should not be the abolition or\nreplacement of punishment: \u2018restoration\u2019 is better\nunderstood, in this context, as the proper aim of punishment, not as\nan alternative to it (see further Duff 2001, ch. 3.4\u20136, but also\nZedner 1994).\n\nA similar issue is raised by the second kind of abolitionist theory\nthat we should note here: the argument that we should replace\npunishment by a system of enforced restitution (see e.g., Barnett\n1977; Boonin 2008: ch. 5 \u2014 which also cites and discusses a\nnumber of objections to the theory). For we need to ask what\nrestitution can amount to, what it should involve, if it is to\nconstitute restitution not merely for any harm that might have been\ncaused, but for the wrong that was done; and it is tempting to answer\nthat restitution for a wrong must involve the kind of apologetic moral\nreparation, expressing a remorseful recognition of the wrong, that\ncommunicative punishment (on the view sketched above) aims to\nbecome.\n\nMore generally, advocates of restorative justice and of restitution\nare right to highlight the question of what offenders owe to those\nwhom they have wronged \u2014 and to their fellow citizens (see also\nTadros 2011 for a focus on the duties that offenders incur). Some\npenal theorists, however, especially those who connect punishment to\napology, will reply that what offenders owe precisely includes\naccepting, undertaking, or undergoing punishment.\n\nA third alternative approach that has gained some prominence in recent\nyears is grounded in belief in free will scepticism, the view that\nhuman behaviour is a result of free will but of determinism, luck, or\nchance, and thus that the notions of moral responsibility and desert\non which many accounts of punishment (especially retributivist\ntheories) depend are misguided (see s. 5). As an alternative to\nholding offenders responsible, or giving them their just deserts, some\nfree will sceptics (see Pereboom 2013; Caruso 2021) instead endorse\nincapacitating dangerous offenders on a model similar to that of\npublic health quarantines. Just as it can arguably be justified to\nquarantine someone carrying a transmissible disease even if that\nperson is not morally responsible for the threat they pose, proponents\nof the quarantine model contend that it can be justified to\nincapacitate dangerous offenders even if they are not morally\nresponsible for what they have done or for the danger they present.\nOne question is whether the quarantine model is best understood as an\nalternative to punishment or as an alternative form of punishment.\nBeyond questions of labelling, however, such views also face various\nlines of critique. In particular, because they discard the notions of\nmoral responsibility and desert, they face objections, similar to\nthose faced by pure consequentialist accounts (see s. 3), that they\ncannot in principle rule out disproportionate punishment, or that they\nare inconsistent with respect for persons and with human dignity (see,\ne.g., Smilansky 2011).\n8. International Criminal Law and Punishment\n\nTheoretical discussions of criminal punishment and its justification\ntypically focus on criminal punishment in the context of domestic\ncriminal law. But a theory of punishment must also have something to\nsay about its rationale and justification in the context of\ninternational criminal law: about how we should understand, and\nwhether and how we can justify, the punishments imposed by such\ntribunals as the International Criminal Court. For we cannot assume\nthat a normative theory of domestic criminal punishment can simply be\nread across into the context of international criminal law (see Drumbl\n2007). Rather, the imposition of punishment in the international\ncontext raises distinctive conceptual and normative issues.\n\nOne key question is which crimes rise to the level of\n\u2018international crimes\u2019 and are thus rightly subject to\nprosecution and punishment by international rather than domestic\ninstitutions. One prominent answer to this question (May 2005) holds\nthat when a state fails to assure its citizens\u2019 safety and\nsecurity, it thus has no right to prevent international bodies from\ninfringing its sovereignty. Such international intervention is only\njustified, however, in cases of serious harm to the international\ncommunity, or to humanity as a whole. Crimes harm humanity as a whole,\non this account, when they are group-based either in the sense that\nthey are based on group characteristics of the victims or are\nperpetrated by a state or another group agent. Such as account has\nbeen subject to challenge focused on its harm-based account of crime\n(Renzo 2012) and its claim that group-based crimes harm humanity as a\nwhole (A. Altman 2006). One response to this sort of account, then, is\nto reject the international harm requirement and to contend, instead,\nthat a state\u2019s failure to protect its members\u2019 rights is\nsufficient to justify international intervention (Altman and Wellman\n2004), or that international criminal tribunals can be justified if\nthey provide fair procedures for trials and punishments in response to\nsufficiently heinous crimes (Luban 2010).\n\nWe might think, by contrast, that the heinousness of a crime or the\nexistence of fair legal procedures is not enough. We also need some\nrelational account of why the international legal community \u2014\nrather than this or that domestic legal entity \u2014 has standing to\ncall perpetrators of genocide or crimes against humanity to account:\nthat is, why the offenders are answerable to the international\ncommunity (see Duff 2010). For claims of standing to be legitimate,\nthey must be grounded in some shared normative community that includes\nthe perpetrators themselves as well as those on behalf of whom the\ninternational legal community calls the perpetrators to account. (For\nother discussions of jurisdiction to prosecute and punish\ninternational crimes, see W. Lee 2010; Wellman 2011; Giudice and\nSchaeffer 2012; Davidovic 2015.)\n\nAnother important question is how international institutions should\nassign responsibility for crimes such as genocide, which are\nperpetrated by groups rather than by individuals acting alone. (Such\nquestions arise in the domestic context as well, with respect to\ncorporations, but the magnitude of crimes such as genocide makes the\nquestions especially poignant at the international level.) The\nNuremberg Tribunal articulated what has since become the governing\nview in international criminal law: \u2018Crimes against\ninternational law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and\nonly by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the\nprovisions of international law be enforced\u2019 (International\nMilitary Tribunal 1947). Several scholars in recent years have\nsuggested, however, that rather than focusing only on prosecuting and\npunishing members of the groups responsible for mass atrocities, it\nmay sometimes be preferable to prosecute and punish the entire group\nqua group. A worry for such proposals is that, because punishment\ncharacteristically involves the imposition of burdens, punishment of\nan entire group risks inflicting punitive burdens on innocent members\nof the group: those who were nonparticipants in the crime, or perhaps\neven worked against it or were among its victims. In response to this\nconcern, defenders of the idea of collective punishment have suggested\nthat it need not distribute among the members of the group (see\nErskine 2011; Pasternak 2011; Tanguagy-Renaud 2013; but see Hoskins\n2014b), or that the benefits of such punishment may be valuable enough\nto override concerns about harm to innocents (see Lang 2007: 255).\n9. Collateral Consequences\n\nPunishment theorists should also attend to various other kinds of\nburdensome consequences of criminal convictions, often called\n\u2018collateral consequences\u2019. Most centrally, those convicted\nof crimes are subject to a range of coercive state policies: measures\nrestricting offenders\u2019 access to jobs, housing, public\nassistance, the vote, and a host of others goods; subjecting them to\ncontinued detention; making their criminal records publicly available,\nand so on \u2014 often long after they have completed their formal\ncriminal sentences (see, e.g., von Hirsch and Wasik 1997; LaFollette\n2005; de Keijser 2012; Hoskins 2014a, 2016, 2019; Sigler 2014; Bennett\n2016; Brown 2021). Legal practice has tended to treat these sorts of\nmeasures not as part of an offender\u2019s punishment, but as civil\nor administrative measures (one effect of which is that they often\nescape the constraints of justice and proportionality to which\npunishment is subject). Many coercive measures are imposed even on\nthose who have not been convicted, such as the many kinds of\nrestriction that may be imposed on people suspected of involvement in\nterrorism, or housing or job restrictions tied merely to arrests\nrather than convictions.\n\nThe legal measures are relevant for punishment theorists for a number\nof reasons, but here we note just two: First, at least some of these\nrestrictive measures may be best regarded as as additional forms of\npunishment (see Lippke 2016: ch. 9; Hoskins 2019: chs. 3 and 4). For\nsuch measures, we must ask whether they are (or can be made to be)\nconsistent with the principles and considerations we believe should\ngovern impositions of punishment. Second, even if at least some\nmeasures are not best regarded as additional forms of punishment, we\nshould ask what justifies the state in imposing additional coercive\nmeasures on those convicted of crimes outside the context of the\npunishment itself (see Ashworth and Zedner 2011, 2012; Ramsay 2011;\nAshworth, Zedner, and Tomlin 2013; Hoskins 2019: chs. 5\u20137). For\ninstance, if we regard punishment as the way in which offenders pay\ntheir debts to society, we can argue that it is at least presumptively\nunjustified for the state to impose additional burdensome measures on\noffenders once this debt has been paid. To say that certain measures\nare presumptively unjustified is not, of course, to establish that\nthey are all-things-considered prohibited. Various collateral\nconsequences \u2014 restrictions on employment or housing, for\nexample \u2014 are often defended as public safety measures. We might\nargue (see Hoskins 2019: ch. 7) that in some cases considerations of\npublic safety can be sufficiently compelling to justify certain\nmeasures (for example, measures that bar people with convictions for\nchild sex offences from working as teachers, or that bar fraudsters\nfrom working in jobs where they are responsible for other people's\nmoney). Public safety restrictions could only be justifiable, however,\nwhen there is a sufficiently compelling public safety interest, when\nthe measures will be effective in serving that interest, when the\nmeasures will not do more harm than good, and when there are no less\nburdensome means of achieving the public safety aim. Even for public\nsafety measures that meet these conditions, we should not lose sight\nof the worry that imposing such restrictions on people with criminal\nconvictions but who have served their terms of punishment denies them\nthe equal treatment to which they, having paid their debt, are\nentitled (on this last worry, see, e.g., Walen 2011:1264\u201366;\nLippke 2016: ch. 9; Hoskins 2019: ch. 7).\n\nIn addition to these formal legal consequences of a conviction, people\nwith criminal records also face a range of informal collateral\nconsequences, such as social stigma, family tensions, discrimination\nby employers and housing authorities, and financial challenges. These\nconsequences are not imposed by positive law, but they may be\npermitted by formal legal provisions (such as those that grant broad\ndiscretion to public housing authorities in the United States making\nadmission decisions) or facilitated by them (such as when laws making\ncriminal records widely accessible enable employers or landlords to\ndiscriminate against those with criminal histories). There are also\nwidely documented burdensome consequences of a conviction to the\nfamily members or loved ones of those who are convicted, and to their\ncommunities. These sorts of informal consequences of criminal\nconvictions appear less likely than the formal legal consequences to\nconstitute legal punishment, insofar as they are not intentionally\nimposed by the state (but see Kolber 2012). Still, the informal\ncollateral consequences of a conviction are arguably relevant to\ntheorising about punishment, and we should examine when, if ever, such\nburdens are relevant to sentencing determinations (on sentencing, see\ns. 10), or whether the state has obligations to ensure that the\nburdens of punishment do not spill over beyond the intended burdens of\nthe criminal sentence (see Manning 2011; B\u00fclow 2014; Lippke\n2017).\n10. Further Issues\n\nA number of further important questions are relevant to theorising\nabout punishment, which can only be noted here.\n\nFirst, there are questions about sentencing. (See generally Robinson\n1987; Morris and Tonry 1990; von Hirsch 1993; Tonry 1996; von Hirsch\nand Ashworth 2005; Ashworth, von Hirsch and Roberts 2009; Frase 2012.)\nWho should decide what kinds and what levels of sentence should be\nattached to different offences or kinds of offence: what should be the\nrespective roles of legislatures, of sentencing councils or\ncommissions, of appellate courts, of trial judges, of juries? By what\ncriteria should such decisions be made: how far should they be guided\nby a retributivist principle of proportionality, requiring punishments\nto be \u2018proportionate\u2019 in their severity to the seriousness\nof the crime; how far by consequentialist considerations of efficient\ncrime-prevention? What kinds of punishment should be available to\nsentencers, and how should they decide which mode of punishment is\nappropriate for the particular offence? Considerations of the meaning\nof different modes of punishment should be central to these questions\n(see e.g., Lippke 2007, Hoskins 2013).\n\nSecond, there are questions about the relation between theory and\npractice \u2014 between the ideal, as portrayed by a normative theory\nof punishment, and the actualities of existing penal practice. Suppose\nwe have come to believe, as a matter of normative theory, that a\nsystem of legal punishment could in principle be justified \u2014\nthat the abolitionist challenge can be met. It is, to put it mildly,\nunlikely that our normative theory of justified punishment will\njustify our existing penal institutions and practices: it is far more\nlikely that such a theory will show our existing practices to be\nradically imperfect \u2014 that legal punishment as it is now imposed\nis far from meaning or achieving what it should mean or achieve if it\nis to be adequately justified (see Heffernan and Kleinig 2000). If our\nnormative theorising is to be anything more than an empty intellectual\nexercise, if it is to engage with actual practice, we then face the\nquestion of what we can or should do about our current practices. The\nobvious answer is that we should strive so to reform them that they\ncan be in practice justified, and that answer is certainly available\nto consequentialists, on the plausible assumption that maintaining our\npresent practices, while also seeking their reform, is likely to do\nmore good or less harm than abandoning them. But for retributivists\nwho insist that punishment is justified only if it is just, and for\ncommunicative theorists who insist that punishment is just and\njustified only if it communicates an appropriate censure to those who\ndeserve it, the matter is harder: for to maintain our present\npractices, even while seeking their radical reform, will be to\nmaintain practices that perpetrate serious injustice (see Murphy 1973;\nDuff 2001, ch. 5).\n\nFinally, the relation between the ideal and the actual is especially\nproblematic in the context of punishment partly because it involves\nthe preconditions of just punishment. That is to say, what makes an\nactual system of punishment unjust(ified) might be not its own\noperations as such (what punishment is or achieves within that\nsystem), but the absence of certain political, legal and moral\nconditions on which the whole system depends for its legitimacy (see\nDuff 2001, ch. 5.2). Recent scholarship on punishment has increasingly\nacknowledged that the justification of punishment depends on the\njustification of the criminal law more generally, and indeed the\nlegitimacy of the state itself (see s. 2 above). For example, if the\nstate passes laws criminalising conduct that is not justifiably\nprohibited, then this calls into question the justification of the\npunishment it imposes for violations of these laws. Questions of\ncriminalisation are thus directly relevant to punishment\u2019s\njustification (see Husak 2008). Similarly, if the procedures by which\ncriminal justice officials apprehend, charge, and prosecute\nindividuals are unjustified, then the subsequent inflictions of\npunishment will be unjustified as well (see Ristroph 2015 and 2016; on\nspecific aspects of criminal procedure, see, e.g., Loader 2014 on\npolicing, Lippke 2011 on plea bargaining, Duff et al 2007 on criminal\ntrials, Flanders 2013 on pardons). More broadly, if a states tolerates\n(or worse, encourages) serious social injustices, then this may\nundermine the state\u2019s standing to punish offenders who are also\nvictims of such injustices (see, e.g., Matravers 2006; Duff 2007;\nHolroyd 2010; Chau 2012; Howard 2013).\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Adelsberg, L., L.
