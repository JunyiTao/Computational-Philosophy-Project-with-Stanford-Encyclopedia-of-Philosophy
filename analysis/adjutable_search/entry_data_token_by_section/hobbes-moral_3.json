    "main_text": "The State of Nature Is a State of War\n4. The State of Nature Is a State of War\n\nTaken together, these plausible descriptive and normative assumptions\nyield a state of nature potentially fraught with divisive struggle.\nThe right of each to all things invites serious conflict, especially\nif there is competition for resources, as there will surely be over at\nleast scarce goods such as the most desirable lands, spouses, etc.\nPeople will quite naturally fear that others may (citing the right of\nnature) invade them, and may rationally plan to strike first as an\nanticipatory defense. Moreover, that minority of prideful or\n\u201cvain-glorious\u201d persons who take pleasure in exercising\npower over others will naturally elicit preemptive defensive responses\nfrom others. Conflict will be further fueled by disagreement in\nreligious views, in moral judgments, and over matters as mundane as\nwhat goods one actually needs, and what respect one properly merits.\nHobbes imagines a state of nature in which each person is free to\ndecide for herself what she needs, what she\u2019s owed, what\u2019s\nrespectful, right, pious, prudent, and also free to decide all of\nthese questions for the behavior of everyone else as well, and to act\non her judgments as she thinks best, enforcing her views where she\ncan. In this situation where there is no common authority to resolve\nthese many and serious disputes, we can easily imagine with Hobbes\nthat the state of nature would become a \u201cstate of war\u201d,\neven worse, a war of \u201call against all\u201d.\n",
