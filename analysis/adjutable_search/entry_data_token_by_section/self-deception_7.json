    "main_text": "Twisted or Negative Self-Deception\n4. Twisted or Negative Self-Deception\n\n\u2018Twisted\u2019 or negative self-deception differs from\n\u2018straight\u2019 or positive self-deception because it involves\nthe acquisition of an unwelcome as opposed to a\nwelcome belief (Mele 1999, 2001; Funkhouser 2019). Roughly,\nthe negatively self-deceived have a belief that is neither warranted\nnor wanted in consequence of some desire, emotion, or combination of\nboth. For instance, a jealous husband, uncertain about his\nwife\u2019s fidelity, comes to believe she\u2019s having an affair\non scant and ambiguous evidence, something he certainly doesn\u2019t\nwant to be the case. Intentionalists may see little problem here, at\nleast in terms of offering a unified account, since both positive and\nnegative self-deceivers intend to produce the belief in question, and\nnothing about intentional deception precludes getting the victim to\nbelieve something unpleasant or undesirable. That said,\nintentionalists typically see the intention to believe p as\nserving a desire to believe p (Davidson 1985; Talbott 1995;\nBerm\u00fadez 2000, 2017), so they still face the difficult task of\nexplaining why negative self-deceivers intend to acquire a belief they\ndon\u2019t want (Lazar 1999; Echano 2017). Non-intentionalists have a\nsteeper hill to climb since it\u2019s difficult to see how someone\nlike the anxious husband could be motivated to form a belief that he\ndoesn\u2019t at all desire. The challenge for the non-intentionalist,\nthen, is to supply a motivational story that explains the acquisition\nof such an unwelcome belief. Ideally, the aim is to provide a unified\nexplanation for both the positive and negative varieties with a view\nto theoretical simplicity. Attempts to provide such an explanation now\nconstitute a significant and growing body of literature that centers\non the nature of the motivations involved and the precise role affect\nplays in the process.\n\nSince the desire for the welcome belief cannot serve as the motive for\nacquiring the unwelcome one, non-intentionalists have sought some\nulterior motive (Pears 1984), such as the reduction of anxiety (Barnes\n1997), the avoidance of costly errors (Mele 1999, 2001), or denial\nthat the motivation is oriented toward the state of the world at all\n(Nelkin 2002).\n\nThe jealous husband might be motivated to believe his wife is\nunfaithful because it supports the vigilance needed to eliminate all\nrival lovers and preserve the relationship\u2014both of which he\ndesires (Pears 1984). Similarly, I might be anxious about my house\nburning down and come to hold the unwelcome belief that I\u2019ve\nleft the burner on. Ultimately, acquiring the unwelcome belief reduces\nmy anxiety because it prompts me to double-check the stove (Barnes\n1997). Some are skeptical that identifying such ulterior desires or\nanxieties is always possible or necessary (Lazar 1999; Mele 2001).\nMany, following Mele (2001, 2003), see a simpler explanation of\nnegative cases in terms of the way motivation, broadly speaking,\naffects the agent\u2019s assessment of the relative costs of error.\nThe jealous husband\u2014not wanting to be made a fool\u2014sees the\ncost of falsely believing his spouse is faithful as high, while the\nperson anxious about their house burning down sees the cost of falsely\nbelieving the burner is on as low. Factors such as what the agent\ncares about and what she can do about the situation affect these error\ncost assessments and may explain, in part, the conditions under which\nnegative self-deception occurs.\n\nSince negative self-deception often involves emotions\u2014fear,\nanxiety, jealousy, rage\u2014a good deal of attention has been given\nto how this component is connected to the motivation driving negative\nself-deception. Some, like Mele (2001, 2003), acknowledge the\npossibility that emotion alone or in combination with desire is\nfundamental to what motivates bias in these cases but remain reluctant\nto say such affective motives are essential or entirely\ndistinguishable from the desires involved. Others worry that leaving\nmotivation so ambiguous threatens the claim to provide a unified\nexplanation of self-deception (Galeotti 2016a). Consequently, some\nhave sought a more central role for affect, seeing emotion as\ntriggering or priming motivationally biased cognition (Scott-Kakures\n2000, 200; Echano 2017) or as operating as a kind of evidential filter\nin a pre-attentive\u2014non-epistemic\u2014appraisal of threatening\nevidence (Galeotti 2016a). On this latter affective-filter view, our\nemotions may lead us to see evidence regarding a situation we consider\nsignificant to our wellbeing as ambiguous and therefore potentially\ndistressing, especially when we deem our ability to deal with the\nunwelcome situation as limited. Depending on how strong our affective\nresponse to the distressing evidence is, we may end up discounting\nevidence for the situation we want, listening instead to our negative\nemotions (anxiety, fear, sorrow, etc.), with the result that we become\nnegatively self-deceived (see Lauria and Preissmann 2018). Research on\nthe role of dopamine regulation and negative somatic markers provides\nsome neurobiological evidence in support of this sort of\naffective-filter model and its potential to offer a unified account of\npositive and negative self-deception (Lauria et al. 2016; Lauria and\nPreissmann 2018).\n\nWhile the philosophers considered so far take the relevant motives to\nbe about the state of the world, some hold that the relevant motives\nhave to do with self-deceivers\u2019 states of mind. If this latter\ndesire-to-believe approach is taken, then there may be just one\ngeneral motive for both kinds of self-deception. Nelkin (2002, 2012),\nfor instance, argues that the motivation for self-deceptive belief\nformation should be restricted to a desire to believe that p\nand that this is compatible with not wanting p to be true. I\nmight want to hold the belief that I have left the stove\nburner on but not want it to be the case that I have actually left it\non. The belief is desirable in this instance because holding it\nensures it won\u2019t be true. What unifies cases of\nself-deception\u2014both twisted and straight\u2014is that the\nself-deceptive belief is motivated by a desire to believe that\np; what distinguishes them is that twisted self-deceivers do not\nwant p to be the case, while straight self-deceivers do.\nSome, like Mele (2009), argue that such an approach is unnecessarily\nrestrictive since a variety of other motives oriented toward the state\nof the world might lead one to acquire the unwelcome belief; for\nexample, even just wanting to not be wrong about the welcome belief\n(see Nelkin 2012 for a response). Others, like Galeotti (2016a), worry\nthat this desire-to-believe account renders self-deceivers\u2019\nepistemic confusion into something bordering on incoherence since it\nseems to imply self-deceivers want to believe p regardless of\nthe state of the world, and such a desire seems absurd even at an\nunconscious level.\n\nWhether the motive for self-deception aims at the state of the world\nor the state of the self-deceiver\u2019s mind, the role of affect in\nthe process remains a significant question that further research in\nneurobiology may shed light upon. The role of affect has been\nunderappreciated but seems to be gathering support and will no doubt\nguide future theorizing, especially on negative self-deception.\n",
