    "main_text": "The theoretical framework of experimental psychology\n5. The theoretical framework of experimental psychology\n\nAs we have seen\n (Section 3.2),\n for Wundt the possibility of a physiological psychology (as\nopposed to a purely physiological inquiry into sensation, behavior,\nlearning, etc.) depends on the possibility of self-observation.\nSelf-observation, in turn, is of scientific use only if the sequence\nof \u201cinner\u201d phenomena of consciousness is assumed to fall\nunder an independent principle of psychic causality. For if it does\nnot, then these phenomena could never be more than a chaotic muddle,\nof which there could be no science. Alternatively, if the\n\u201cinner\u201d phenomena could be shown to fall under the\nphysical causality of the natural sciences, then there would be no\nneed for a special psychological method, such as self-observation (cf.\nNatorp 1912). In fact, however, a system of psychic causality can be\ndetermined, Wundt argues, one that at no point is reducible to\nphysical causality: \u201cno connection of physical processes can\never teach us anything about the manner of connection between\npsychological elements\u201d (Wundt 1894: 43, quoted in Kusch 1995:\n134). This \u201cfact\u201d, which Wundt thinks is given in the\npsycho-physiological experiments described above, leads him to his\nso-called principle of psychophysical parallelism (PPP).\n\nThe PPP has caused a great deal of confusion in the secondary\nliterature, which persists in characterizing it as a\n metaphysical[42]\n doctrine somehow derived from Leibniz (e.g., Wellek 1967: 350;\nThompson and Robinson 1979: 412) or Spinoza (cf. L I: 77).\nWundt however is crystal-clear that the PPP is not a metaphysical\n\u201chypothesis\u201d. It is merely an admittedly misleading name\nfor an \u201cempirical postulate\u201d necessary to explain the\nphenomenal \u201cfact\u201d of consciousness of which we are\nimmediately aware (Wundt 1911a: 22; cf. esp. 28). By denying any\nmetaphysical interpretation of his principle, Wundt insists that the\n\u201cphysical\u201d and the \u201cpsychic\u201d do not name two\nontologically distinct realms whose events unfold on separate yet\nparallel causal tracks. He is therefore not an epiphenomenalist, as\nsome commentators have claimed. Rather, the \u201cphysical\u201d and\n\u201cpsychic\u201d name two mutually irreducible perspectives from\nwhich one and the same world or Being (Sein) may be observed:\n\u201cnothing occurs in our consciousness that does not find its\nsensible foundation in certain physical processes\u201d, he writes,\nand all psychological acts (association, apperception,\nwilling) \u201care accompanied by physiological nerve-actions\u201d\n(PP II: 644). In distinguishing the empirical from the\nmetaphysical PPP, Wundt contrasts his own view against\nSpinoza\u2019s, which, according to Wundt, makes the realm of\nmaterial substance exist separately from, though parallel to that of\nmental substance (Wundt 1911a: 22, 44\u20135; cf. esp. Wundt 1911a:\n143, ff.).\n\nThe investigator of psychological phenomena, therefore, must assume,\nsolely for heuristic reasons, two \u201cparallel\u201d and\nirreducible causal chains by which two distinct types of phenomena may\nbe accounted for (Wundt 1911a: 143; cf. Van Rappard 1979: 109). Wundt\ncompares the distinction between psychological and physiological\nexplanation to the different viewpoints taken by chemistry and physics\nof the same object, a crystal. The chemical and physical accounts are\nnot of two different entities; rather, they describe and explain the\nsame entity from two distinct points of view, and in this sense the\ntwo accounts are \u201cparallel\u201d. Similarly, (neuro-)\nphysiology and psychology do not describe different processes, one\nneural and one mental, but the same process seen from the outside and\nthe inside, respectively. As Wundt writes,\n\n\n\u201cinner\u201d and \u201couter\u201d experience merely\ndesignate distinct perspectives that we can apply in our\ngrasp and scientific investigation of what is, in itself, a unitary\nexperience. (Wundt 1896a; quoted at Natorp 1912: 264).\n\n",
