    "main_text": "Models of Global Democracy || Deliberative Democracy\n2.4 Deliberative Democracy\n\n\nGlobal democracy scholarship has also been infused by myriad\ndeliberative democratic proposals. This model suggests that global\npolitics can be democratized by pursuing deliberation\u2014the give\nand take of non-coercive and reasoned arguments\u2014in various\nformal and informal sites. A vast number of authors have promoted this\nmodel, including John Dryzek, Seyla Benhabib, Karin B\u00e4ckstrand,\nand James Bohman. The fundamental normative ideal is that\nnon-coercive, reciprocal, and generalizable deliberation should guide\naction, and that decision-making be justified to those affected (Forst\n2011). Individuals should be free to put their ideas forward under\negalitarian conditions, take on-board the ideas of others, and\nrecalibrate preferences in line with \u2018better\narguments\u2019. This helps to respect the autonomy of different\nagents while also enhancing the epistemic quality of\ndecision-making. This model has clear connections with a\n\u2018stakeholder model\u2019 of global democracy, in which those\nindividuals significantly affected by a global decision should be able\nto deliberate over how public power is exercised and how power\nwielders are held to account (Macdonald 2008).\n\n\nThis model seeks the deliberative democratization of informal and\nformal sites of existing governance arrangements from the\nlocal to the global level. As such, the institutional design task is\nusually about recalibrating current institutions and organizations to\nreflect non-coercive argumentation rather than creating new bodies. At\nthe informal level, some deliberative democrats point to transnational\npublic spheres as appropriate sites for democratic agency (Steffek\n2010). Indeed, some claim that a global civil society has emerged\nwhich provides a space\u2014separate from the state and the\nmarket\u2014for individuals to deliberate, shape preferences, and\ncreate shared goals (Dryzek 2000). The model also calls for the\ndeliberation democratization of formal sites, such as WTO\nnegotiations, IMF loan deals, and regional treaty agreements\n(B\u00e4ckstrand 2006). By making negotiations more\ndeliberative\u2014responsive to the reasoned arguments of affected\nindividuals\u2014world politics becomes more democratic. At the\nintersection of formal and informal proposals, deliberative democrats\noften point to the increasing inclusion of non-state actors in formal\norganizations as a step toward global democracy (Dryzek 2012). As\nNGOs, youth groups, epistemic communities, and business organizations\ngain access to sites of international decision-making, this helps\nincrease the diversity of viewpoints and provides non-state groups\nwith a way to contest traditional IGO negotiations (Tallberg et\nal. 2013). Many actors in global civil society have accused IOs of\nsuffering from a democratic deficit as a strategy to gain\ninclusion. This highlights the interconnections between academia and\npolicy practice in terms of global democracy.\n\n\nGlobal deliberative democracy has had many proponents and even more\ncritics. A fairly standard complaint is that the model fails to\nprovide a specific institutional design which can be sought or\nrealized under existing conditions. Moreover, deliberation is said to\nsuffer from a lack of decisiveness. Voting mechanisms always allow for\nindividuals to cast their preferences with the understanding that 50\nper cent plus one vote wins the election. Deliberation provides no\nmechanism for groups to make definitive decisions, and talking until\nagreement (consensus) is reached is both time-consuming and\npotentially unrealizable. In terms of desirability, Eva Erman (2012)\nhas argued that deliberative democrats do not take the notion of\nequality seriously enough, thus undermining a core ideal of\ndemocracy. It is difficult to envisage, Erman suggests, how\nindividuals can have equal opportunity for deliberation in a world of\ninequality. Relatedly, the inclusion of non-state actors in formal IOs\nis often seen as a form of cooptation in which civil society actually\nworks in subservience to (and thus legitimates) the established\nsystem. This line of criticism could be classified as a\n\u2018governmentality\u2019 critique in the tradition of\nFoucault. As such, there is a concern that including civil society in\ndeliberation with formal sites of global decision-making\nexacerbates\u2014rather than reduces\u2014the global democratic\ndeficit.\n",
