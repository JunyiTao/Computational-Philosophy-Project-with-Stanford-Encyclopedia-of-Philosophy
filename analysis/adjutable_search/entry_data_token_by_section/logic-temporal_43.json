At the same time, the logical formalisms\nand technical systems developed over the years have found application\nin various different disciplines, ranging from computer science,\nartificial intelligence, and linguistics, to natural, cognitive, and\nsocial sciences. In this section, we briefly discuss some pertinent\napplications of temporal logics in computer science, artificial\nintelligence, and linguistics.\n",
