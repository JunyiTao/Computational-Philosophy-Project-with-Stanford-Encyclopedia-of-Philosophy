The Best of Both Worlds?\n\nScientific realism became dominant in philosophy of science after the\ndemise of the forms of antirealism about science associated with the\nlogical positivists, namely semantic instrumentalism, according to\nwhich theoretical terms are not to be interpreted as referring to\nanything, and theoretical reductionism, according to which theoretical\nterms are disguised ways of referring to observable phenomena. These\nforms of antirealism rely upon discredited positivist ideas about\nscientific language, such as that it can be divided into theoretical\nand observational parts, that much of it should not be taken\nliterally, or that its empirically surplus content is redundant. Bas\nvan Fraassen (1980) revitalised the debate about scientific realism by\nproposing his constructive empiricism as an alternative. His\nantirealism is sceptical rather than dogmatic, and does not depend on\nthe distinction between theoretical and observational terms. He allows\nthat terms such as \u201csub-atomic particle\u201d and\n\u201cparticle too small to see\u201d are perfectly meaningful and\nshould be taken literally (the former term is theoretical and the\nlatter term is not but both purportedly refer to unobservable\nentities). On the other hand, he holds that it is perfectly rational\nto remain agnostic about whether there are any such particles, because\nhe argues that to accept the best scientific theories we have only\nrequires believing that they are empirically adequate, in the sense of\ncorrectly describing the observable world, rather than believing that\nthey are true simpliciter. (For more on constructive empiricism see\nMonton 2007.)\n\nHow then are we to decide whether to believe in the full theoretical\ntruth of scientific theories, including what they say about\nunobservable entities such as electrons and black holes, or whether to\nbelieve instead only that our best scientific theories are empirically\nadequate? Van Fraassen argues that since the latter belief is\nlogically weaker and yet as empirically contentful as the former\nbelief it is natural for an empiricist to go only as far as belief in\nempirical adequacy. On the other hand, many philosophers are moved by\nthe fact that belief in only the empirical adequacy of our best\nscientific theories leaves us unable to explain the phenomena that\nthey describe. Inference to the best explanation is widely believed to\nbe an important form of reasoning in science, and the production of\nexplanations of the world is often supposed to be one of the main\nsuccesses of science. When the target of explanation becomes science\nitself and its history of empirical success as a whole, we arrive at\nthe no-miracles argument famously presented by Hilary Putnam as\nfollows:\n\n\nThe positive argument for realism is that it is the only philosophy\nthat doesn\u2019t make the success of science a miracle. (1975:\n73)\n\n\nThe no-miracles argument is elaborated in terms of specific features\nof scientific methodology and practice. Richard Boyd (1985, for\nexample) argues that in explaining the success of science, we need to\nexplain the overall instrumental success of scientific methods across\nthe history of science. Alan Musgrave (1988) says that the only\nversion of the no-miracles argument that might work is one appealing\nto the novel predictive success of theories. Some realists, such as\nPsillos (1999), have gone so far as to argue that only theories which\nhave enjoyed novel predictive success ought to be considered as\nfalling within the scope of arguments for scientific realism.\n\nColin Howson (2000), P.D. Magnus and Craig Callender (2004), and Peter\nLipton (2004) argue that the no-miracles argument is flawed because in\norder to evaluate the claim that it is probable that theories enjoying\nempirical success are approximately true we have to know what the\nrelevant base rate is, and there is no way we can know this. Magnus\nand Callender argue that \u201cwholesale\u201d arguments that are\nintended to support realism (or antirealism) about science as a whole\n(rather than \u201cretail\u201d arguments that are applied to a\nspecific theory) are only taken seriously because of our propensity to\nengage in the \u201cbase rate fallacy\u201d of evaluating\nprobabilities without knowing all the relevant information. They think\nwe ought to abandon the attempt to defend scientific realism in\ngeneral rather than on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis assumes that the wholesale arguments against scientific realism\ndo not work. Of these the underdetermination argument, according to\nwhich the existence of empirical equivalents to our best scientific\ntheories implies that we should withhold epistemic commitment to them,\nis is often dismissed by realists as generating doubt about\nunobservables that is no more worrying than doubting other minds or\nthe external world. They argue that since scientists find ways of\nchoosing between empirically equivalent rivals, philosophers ought not\nto make too much of merely in-principle possibilities that are\nirrelevant to scientific practice (see Laudan & Leplin 1991;\nLeplin & Laudan 1993; and Kukla 1998). (Kyle Stanford (2006)\ndefends an underdetermination argument called \u201cthe problem of\nunconceived alternatives\u201d with reference to the history of\nscience, so perhaps not all underdetermination arguments are a\npriori and theoretical.)\n\nThe power of the arguments against scientific realism from theory\nchange is that, rather than being a priori and theoretical,\nthey are empirically based and their premises are based on data\nobtained by examining the practice and history of science. Ontological\ndiscontinuity in theory change seems to give us grounds not for mere\nagnosticism but for the positive belief that many central theoretical\nterms of our best contemporary science will be regarded as\nnon-referring by future science. So-called \u201cpessimistic\nmeta-inductions\u201d about theoretical knowledge take many forms and\nare probably almost as ancient as scepticism itself. They have the\nbasic form:\n\n\nProposition p is widely believed by most contemporary\nexperts, but p is like many other hypotheses that were widely\nbelieved by experts in the past and are disbelieved by most\ncontemporary experts. We have as much reason to expect p to\nbefall their fate as not, therefore we should at least suspend\njudgement about p if not actively disbelieve it.\n\n\nMore precisely, Larry Laudan (1981) gave a very influential argument\nwith the following structure:\n\nThere have been many empirically successful theories\nin the history of science which have subsequently been rejected and\nwhose theoretical terms do not refer according to our best current\ntheories.\nOur best current theories are no different in kind\nfrom those discarded theories and so we have no reason to think they\nwill not ultimately be replaced as well.\n\n\nSo, by induction we have positive reason to expect that our best\ncurrent theories will be replaced by new theories according to which\nsome of the central theoretical terms of our best current theories do\nnot refer, and hence we should not believe in the approximate truth or\nthe successful reference of the theoretical terms of our best current\ntheories.\n\nThe most common realist response to this argument is to restrict\nrealism to theories with some further properties (usually, maturity,\nand novel predictive success) so as to cut down the inductive base\nemployed in\n (i)\n (see Psillos 1996). Moreover Peter Lewis (2001), Marc Lange (2002)\nand Magnus and Callender (2004) regard the pessimistic meta-induction\nas a fallacy of probabilistic reasoning. However, there are arguments\nfrom theory change that are not probabilistic. Note first that there\nare several cases of mature theories which enjoyed novel predictive\nsuccess, notably the ether theory of light and the caloric theory of\nheat. If their central theoretical terms do not refer, the\nrealist\u2019s claim that approximate truth explains empirical\nsuccess will no longer be enough to establish realism, because we will\nneed some other explanation for the success of the caloric and ether\ntheories. If this will do for these theories then it ought to do for\nothers where we happened to have retained the central theoretical\nterms, and then we do not need the realist\u2019s preferred\nexplanation that such theories are true and successfully refer to\nunobservable entities.\n\nLaudan\u2019s paper was also intended to show that the successful\nreference of its theoretical terms is not a necessary condition for\nthe novel predictive success of a theory (1981: 45), and there are\ncounter-examples to the no-miracles argument.\n\nSuccessful reference of its central theoretical terms is a\nnecessary condition for the approximate truth of a theory.\nThere are examples of theories that were mature and had novel\npredictive success but whose central theoretical terms do not\nrefer.\nSo there are examples of theories that were mature and had novel\npredictive success but which are not approximately true.\nApproximate truth and successful reference of central theoretical\nterms is not a necessary condition for the novel-predictive success of\nscientific theories\n\n\n\nSo, the no-miracles argument is undermined since, if approximate truth\nand successful reference are not available to be part of the\nexplanation of some theories\u2019 novel predictive success, there is\nno reason to think that the novel predictive success of other theories\nhas to be explained by realism.\n\n\nThere are two common (not necessarily exclusive) responses to\nthis:\n\n\n\nDevelop an account of reference according to which the abandoned\ntheoretical terms are regarded as successfully referring after\nall.\n\nRealists developed causal theories of reference to account for\ncontinuity of reference for terms like \u201catom\u201d or\n\u201celectron\u201d, even though the theories about atoms and\nelectrons have undergone significant changes. The difference with the\nterms \u201cether\u201d and \u201ccaloric\u201d is that they are\nno longer used in modern science. However, as C.L. Hardin and\nAlexander Rosenberg (1982) argue, the causal theory of reference may\nbe used to defend the claim that terms like \u201cether\u201d\nreferred to whatever causes the phenomena responsible for the\nterms\u2019 introduction. This is criticized by Laudan (1984) as\nmaking the reference of theoretical terms a trivial matter, since as\nlong as some phenomena prompt the introduction of a term it will\nautomatically successfully refer to whatever is the relevant cause (or\ncauses). Furthermore, this theory radically disconnects what a\ntheorist is talking about from what she thinks she is talking about.\nFor example, Aristotle or Newton could be said to be referring to\ngeodesic motion in a curved spacetime when, respectively, they talked\nabout the natural motion of material objects, and the fall of a body\nunder the effect of the gravitational force. \n\n\nRestrict realism to those parts of theories that play an essential\nrole in the derivation of subsequently observed (novel) predictions,\nand then argue that the terms of past theories which are now regarded\nas non-referring were non-essential and hence that there is no reason\nto deny that the essential terms in current theories will be retained.\nPhilip Kitcher says that: \u201c[n]o sensible realist should ever\nwant to assert that the idle parts of an individual practice, past or\npresent, are justified by the success of the whole\u201d (1993:\n142). \n\n\nThe most detailed and influential response to the argument from theory\nchange is due to Psillos (1999), who combines strategies\n (I)\n and\n (II).\n Hasok Chang (2003), Kyle Stanford (2003a,b), Mohammed Elsamahi\n(2005), and Timothy Lyons (2006) criticize Psillos\u2019s account.\nOther responses include Kitcher\u2019s (1993) model of reference\naccording to which some tokens of theoretical terms refer and others\ndo not. Christina McLeish (2005) criticizes Kitcher\u2019s theory by\narguing that there are no satisfactory grounds for making the\ndistinction between referring and non-referring tokens. McLeish (2006)\nargues that abandoned theoretical terms like \u201cether\u201d\npartially refer and partially fail to refer. Juha Saatsi (2005) denies\npremise (a) and claims that there can be approximate truth of the\ncausal roles postulated by a scientific theory without its central\nterms necessarily successfully referring (see also Chakravartty 1998).\nThere is no consensus among those defending standard realism in the\nface of theory change by adopting the selective approach of (II) with\nan account of reference.\n\nConsider again the much-discussed case of the ether. Psillos argues\nthat Fresnel\u2019s use of the term \u201cether\u201d was essential\nto his successful theorising, but that it referred to the\nelectromagnetic field. Worrall (1989) argues that the project of\ndefending realism by securing reference for abandoned theoretical\nterms is missing the point of the problem as well as the key to its\nsolution. It is plausible to take \u201cfield\u201d to be a new way\nof referring to what the ancients and early moderns termed\n\u201caether\u201d or \u201cether\u201d. Fields like the ether\npermeate all of space and are posited to explain optical, magnetic and\nother phenomena. Anaxagoras is said to have introduced the idea of the\nether to propel the planets, and subsequently there were many ethers\nto account for various things. Fresnel\u2019s optical ether was\nsupposed to be a solid and Maxwell\u2019s field behaves very\ndifferently and is said to be immaterial. However, from our current\nperspective the ether has much more in common with the field, than\natoms do with the indivisible particles of antiquity (Stein 1989), and\nso continuity of reference is not the issue. The reference of the term\n\u201cenergy\u201d at least overlaps in classical and quantum\ntheories because quantities in each coincide in the limit as the\nnumber of particles increases. This does not solve the problem that\nthe radical ontological and metaphysical differences between the\ntheories pose for the realist. Different theories often use the same\nterms, to say very different things about what the world is like. The\nquestion of which terms refer, does not settle the whether it is\nplausible to say that the metaphysics and ontology of the theory is\neven approximately true, because in many case the same theoretical\nterm is still used despite radical changes.\n\nThe argument from theory change threatens scientific realism because\nif what science now says is correct, then the ontologies of past\nscientific theories are far from accurate accounts of the furniture of\nthe world. If that is so even though they were predictively\nsuccessful, then the success of our best current theories does not\nmean they have got the nature of the world right either. The task of\nproviding an adequate theory of approximate truth that fits the\nhistory of science and directly addresses the problem of ontological\ncontinuity has hitherto defeated realists, but a much more tractable\nproblem is to display the structural commonalities between different\ntheories. Hence, a form of realism about the structure of theories\nmight not be undermined by theory change. Gerhard Schurz (2009) proves\na structural correspondence theorem showing that successive theories\nthat share empirical content also share theoretical content.\n\nThe structuralist solution to this problem is to take the metaphysical\nimport of successful scientific theories to consist in their giving\ncorrect descriptions of the structure of the world, where this\nstructure can be captured with different ontologies. Theories can be\nso different as to be contrary to each other, while both represent the\nsame structure in the phenomena. Consider the theory according to\nwhich combustion is the emission of phlogiston that was dominant in\nchemistry prior to the end of the eighteenth century. Despite their\nradical disagreement about the nature of combustion both phlogiston\ntheory, and the oxygen theory of Lavoisier that succeeded it, regard\ncombustion, respiration and the calcination of metals as the same kind\nof process, and reciprocal to another kind of process exemplified by\nthe smelting of ore. Furthermore there are tables of affinity that\nwere formulated by the phlogistonists that can be reinterpreted in\nterms of Lavoisian chemistry (see Schurz 2009 and Ladyman 2011).\nHence, even in this case there is continuity of structure despite the\ncentral entity of the old theory not existing at all according to the\nnew theory\n\nThere are numerous examples of continuity in the mathematical\nstructure of successive scientific theories. Indeed the principle that\nold ones should be recovered from new ones in some limit was\nexplicitly formulated by Niels Bohr as the methodological principle\nknown as the \u201ccorrespondence principle\u201d, according to\nwhich quantum-mechanical models ought to mathematically reduce to\nclassical models in the limit of large numbers of particles, or in the\nlimit of Planck\u2019s constant becoming arbitrarily small relative\nto the action of the system. There are many cases in quantum mechanics\nwhere the Hamiltonian functions that represent the total energy of\nmechanical systems imitate those of classical mechanics, but with\nvariables like those that stand for position and momentum replaced by\nHermitian operators. There is a now a large literature in philosophy\nof physics that considers different characterisations of the structure\nof theories, and how it relates to to the relations between them, and\ntheir empirical content. Simon Saunders (1993a) discusses the\nstructural continuities between classical and quantum mechanics and\nalso shows how much structure Ptolemaic and Copernican astronomy have\nin common. Harvey Brown (1993) explains the correspondence between\nSpecial Relativity and classical mechanics. Jonathan Bain and John\nNorton (2001) discuss the structural continuity in descriptions of the\nelectron, as does Angelo Cei (2005). Votsis (2011) considers examples\nof continuity and discontinuity in physics. Robert Batterman (2002)\ndiscusses many examples of limiting relationships between theories,\nnotably the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena, and\nthe relationship between wave and ray optics. Holger Lyre (2004)\nextends Worrall\u2019s original example of the continuity between\nwave optics and electromagnetism by considering the relationship\nbetween Maxwellian electrodynamics and Quantum Electrodynamics. Alisa\nBokulich (2008) considers the quantum-classical transition in detail\narguing for what she calls \u201cinterstructuralism\u201d as an\napproach to intertheory relations that emphasises structural\ncontinuities and correspondences. Zenker and G\u00e4rdenfors (2015)\nadopt a conceptual spaces approach to the continuity of theory\nstructure. Joshua Rosaler (2015) analyses intertheory relations in\nphysics arguing that local relations between models in different\ndomains must be considered as well as global relations between\ntheories. Manero (2022) argues for the stability of Lie algebras over\ntheory change in physics.\n\nThe most minimal form of structuralism focuses on empirical structure,\nand as such is best thought of as a defence of the cumulative nature\nof science in the face of Kuhnian worries about revolutions (following\nPost 1971). See Katherine Brading\u2019s and Elaine Landry\u2019s\n(2006) \u201cminimal structuralism\u201d, and Otavio Bueno\u2019s\n(1999, 2000) and van Fraassen\u2019s (2006, 2007, 2008) structural\nempiricism (Ryckman 2005 calls the latter \u201cinstrumental\nstructuralism\u201d).
