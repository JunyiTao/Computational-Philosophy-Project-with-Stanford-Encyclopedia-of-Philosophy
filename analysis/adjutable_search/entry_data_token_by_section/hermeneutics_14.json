    "main_text": "Contemporary Hermeneutics || Normative Implications\n4.3 Normative Implications\n\nThe hermeneutical experience of truth is, therefore, governed by the\n\u201cprinciple of history of effect\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and\nMethod, Part II.II.B.iv). This means that our attempts to\nunderstand are always guided more by tradition, and thus prejudice,\nthan we are able to make explicit to ourselves. This principle, as\nGadamer maintains, has important normative implications for\ninterpretive experience. These implications follow from the fact that\nit is impossible to become completely self-conscious of the prejudices\noperative in our attempts to understand. As Gadamer puts the point in\nan ontological register, \u201cto be historically means that\nknowledge of oneself can never be complete\u201d (Gadamer,\nTruth and Method, 302). Because of this, the experience of\ntruth leads not to self-certainty, but to the insight that we should\nproceed always with a Delphic self-knowledge of our limits.\n\nSuch Delphic self-knowledge should carry over to our assessment of\nknowledge secured by modern science, as well. For, as Gadamer puts the\npoint, \u201cwhen a na\u00efve faith in scientific method denies the\nexistence of effective history, there can be an actual deformation of\nknowledge\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 301). This is\nevident first of all from the humanistic study of the history of\nscience. After all, knowledge based on the best results of science\ntoday may well have the same fate as the discredited scientific\nknowledge of past times. It is also evident that we should carry over\nDelphic self-knowledge to our assessment of scientific knowledge from\nthe fact that scientific inquiry is always guided by more prejudice\nthan can be kept in check by any method: for example, in the selection\nof research questions, in hypothesis formation, and in any number of\nmetaphysical (or other) assumptions tacitly or unconsciously used to\ncharacterize objects of inquiry.\n\nGadamer maintains that the normative implications of the\n\u2018principle of history of effect\u2019 mean that in our\ninterpretive experience, we should attempt always to expand our\nhorizons. By horizon, Gadamer has in mind the \u201crange\u201d of\nour capacity to understand (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 302),\nas this is made possible and limited by the breadth and depth of what\nwe have already come to understand in our lives. In this concept of\nhorizon, it is not difficult to hear the echo of the humanistic\nsensibility that interpretive experience is educative. Our\nhorizon is the formation we have achieved through our interpretive\nexperience, both from our formal education and from our\nlife-experience. Thus, the normative demand of interpretive experience\nis always to become more educated.\n\nGadamer describes the expansion of our horizons as a \u201cfusion of\nhorizons\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 306). This term\nis perhaps misleading, however, because it can be mistaken to signify\nthat an interpreter has a distinct \u2018horizon\u2019 that is then\nexpanded through the assimilation of another distinct horizon, say,\nthat of a text we are interpreting. Really, though, what Gadamer means\nis that in interpretive experience, our attempts to understand can and\nshould lead us to recognize that our own horizon is not as insular or\nnarrow as we first thought. Rather, we can and should come to\nrecognize that our horizon belongs to a larger context of the\nhistorical transmission of meaning, so that when we come to understand\nsomething, we are thereby raised \u201cto a higher level of\nuniversality that overcomes not only our own particularity but also\nthat of the other\u201d (Gadamer, Truth and Method, 305). In\nthis, \u2018fusion\u2019 signifies something closer to the verbal\nform of Gadamer\u2019s Verschmelzung, that is\nverschmeltzen, to melt together. We expand our horizons\nthrough interpretive experience that melts away at the rigidity of our\nhorizon, so that we can see how it melts into and mixes with a larger\nmovement of transmission.\n",
