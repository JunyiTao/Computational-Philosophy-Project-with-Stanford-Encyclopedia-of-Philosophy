But can every state\nof affairs be a recombination of particulars and properties that are\ncombined in some facts? Combinatorialists answer Yes (see, for\nexample, Skyrms 1981; Armstrong 1989: 45ff; Bigelow 1988; Forbes 1989:\n137). This idea has two main varieties:\n\n\nFictionalism: Like ideal gases or frictionless surfaces,\npossible states of affairs are (useful) fictions; only facts exist.\nAssume that a is not F. There exists no possible state\nof affairs a\u2019s being F. But there is the\nfiction of possible states of affairs according to which there is the\nstate of affairs a\u2019s being F if, and only\nif, a and being F are contained in some facts\n(see Armstrong 1989: 46 and 49ff and the entry on\n modal fictionalism\n for a detailed overview).\n\nRepresentationalism: there are no possible states of affairs,\nonly representations of possible states of affairs (see Lewis 1986:\n146 who ascribes this view to Skyrms). These representations are\nset-theoretic constructs that contain as their members particulars and\nuniversals that occur in some facts. For example, if\na\u2019s being F and b\u2019s\nbeing G are both facts, but the sentence \u201ca\nis G\u201d is false, there is no state of affairs\na\u2019s being G, but there is an ordered-pair\nthat contains a and being G as its members.\n\n\nRepresentationalism raises the question: what distinguishes a\n(possible) state of affairs from a mere representation of it? Why is\nthe state of affairs a\u2019s being G not\nsimply the ordered pair of a and being G? We\nwill come back to this question in\n section 5.\n",
