    "main_text": "Possible Worlds Models\n3. Possible Worlds Models\n\nTrivalent accounts suppose that the truth value of a conditional\ndepends only on the truth values of its parts. However, this\nassumption does not account for a connection of the contents of the\nantecedent and the consequent, a point granted by Frege (1879)\nhimself. In this section we review accounts that preserve the idea\nthat conditionals are truth-evaluable, but assume that their truth\nvalue cannot be settled just by the truth values of the antecedent and\nthe consequent at the actual world. Instead, the antecedent has a\ncertain modal force, it makes its consequent in some sense necessary.\nPossible-worlds models give an explication of the necessity\ninvolved.\n",
