The push to develop a science of society motivates a\ndifferent emphasis in social ontology, as compared to earlier\ntheories. Whereas ancient and early modern theorists largely\ninvestigated the sources or generators of social entities, these\ntheorists devoted more attention to analyzing social entities into\ntheir constituent parts.\n\nPhilosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment argue that social order\narises from aggregates of individuals interacting with one another,\neven if the individuals did not plan the order. \u201cNations stumble\non establishments\u201d, Ferguson 1767 writes, \u201cwhich are\nindeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human\ndesign\u201d. Later attempts to develop a rigorous science of the\nsocial world also employ a similar picture of the components of\nsociety. J.S. Mill builds on Comte 1830\u20131842 to argue that\nsocial science is a branch of psychology. Society, according to Mill,\nis the aggregate of human minds, and the topic of the social sciences\nis to derive laws governing such aggregates. (Mill 1843) Altogether,\nhis approach to social phenomena is \u201cpsychologistic\u201d: he\ntakes social phenomena to be built exclusively out of psychological\nstates of individual people. (The interpretation and expansion of\npsychologism becomes an important topic in twentieth century\nindividualism; see sections\n 3.1\n and\n 3.2.)\n\nThe historicist tradition in eighteenth and nineteenth century German\nphilosophy inverts the relation between individuals and societies.\nRather than seeing individuals as primary, these philosophers stress\nthe primacy of societies, with individuals a product of the societies\nin which they are brought up. Hegel argues that even\nself-consciousness is not something that an individual can possess\nindependently of others. Instead, it depends on our having a sense of\nourselves as individuals as distinct from others, which in turn\ndepends on mutual interactions (Hegel 1807). Hegel also develops the\nidea, following H\u00f6lderlin, of a \u201cWorld-Soul\u201d or\nuniversal human spirit, of which individual actions are a\nmanifestation. Hegel\u2019s universal spirit is sometimes used as an\nexample of \u201contological holism\u201d\u2014i.e., the claim that\nsocial entities are fundamental, independent, or autonomous entities,\nas opposed to being derived from individuals or non-social\nentities.\n\nNineteenth century criminologists, including Taine 1887, Ferri 1884,\nSighele 1891, and Le Bon 1895 investigated mental properties of\ncrowds, such as impetuousness and irrationality. Tarde 1890 postulated\nmechanisms by which crowds acquire these characteristics, by way of\nthe psychology of individuals and interactions among people. Durkheim\n1894 challenged these explanations, arguing that such individualistic\nlaws cannot be adequate to explain crowd psychology or other social\nphenomena. Durkheim argues that \u201csocial facts\u201d are\nautonomous of individuals and have the power to constrain and affect\ntheir actions. In social ontology, Tarde is often seen as a\nrepresentative of \u201cindividualism\u201d and Durkheim of\n\u201cholism\u201d regarding the social world, and their positions\nremain a touchstone for contemporary debates (see\n section 3).\n",
