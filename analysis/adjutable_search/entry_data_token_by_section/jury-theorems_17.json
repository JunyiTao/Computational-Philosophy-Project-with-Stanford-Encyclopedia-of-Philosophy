    "main_text": "Problems and Questions || The problem of incredible truths\n4.4 The problem of incredible truths\n\nSome truths are hard to recognize as they are highly specific, and\nthus unlikely to hold. Recognizing that global temperature will\nrise may be easy, but recognizing that it will rise by 2.3\nDegrees Celsius is hard. Whenever some choice alternative (and\nthus its correctness) is highly specific, competence in jury models is\nthreatened. Suppose a climate panel must form a belief about the\nproposition \\(p\\) that global temperature will rise by 2.3 degrees.\nSomeone\u2019s competence given \\(p\\) (more generally, given facts\nthat entail \\(p\\)) can easily fall below \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), because\ncorrectly recognizing \\(p\\) is hard. Indeed, the available evidence\nmight be compatible with a temperature rise close to, but distinct\nfrom 2.3 degrees. The other effect of \\(p\\)\u2019s high specificity\nis that competence given not-\\(p\\) (more generally, given facts that\nentail not-\\(p\\)) can become very high, because not-\\(p\\) is a very\nunspecific and thus \u201ccredible\u201d proposition. The lesson is\nthat highly unbalanced choice alternatives\u2014a highly specific\nalternative against a highly unspecific alternative\u2014bring the\ncompetence assumption of the Conditional Jury Theorem to fall.\n\nBy contrast, the competence assumptions of Condorcet\u2019s and the\nCompetence-Sensitive Jury Theorem, UC and TC, are not vulnerable to\nthis problem. Why?\n\nUC pertains to the general (\u201cunconditional\u201d)\ncompetence of an individual \\(i\\), \\(P(R_{i})\\), not their specific\ncompetence given facts \\(x\\), \\(P(R_{i}|x)\\). General competence stays\nabove \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), because the (error-conducive) event of the\n\u201cspecific truth\u201d is much less likely than the\n(truth-conducive) event of the \u201cunspecific\n truth\u201d.[17]\nTC explicitly allows (specific) competence to sometimes fall below\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n\nThe problem of incredible truths is a variant of Estlund\u2019s\n(2008: 232\u20134) \u201cdisjunction problem\u201d and of problems\ndiagnosed in List (2005) and Dietrich and Spiekermann (2020).\n",
