    "main_text": "Alternative Non-deductive Methods || Computer Proofs\n3.3 Computer Proofs\n\nA striking feature of contemporary work in experimental mathematics is\nthat it is done using computers. Is this reliance on\ncomplex pieces of electronics what makes the field\n\u2018experimental\u2019? If one looks at what gets published in\ncontemporary journals, books, and conferences devoted to experimental\nmathematics, the impression is that all the items are closely bound up\nwith computers. For example, there does not appear to be a single\npaper published in more than a decade\u2019s worth of issues of\nExperimental Mathematics that does not involve the use of\ncomputers. What about the kinds of examples which mathematicians tend\nto offer as paradigms of experimental mathematics? Here the data is\nless clear. On the one hand, an informal survey suggests that the\nmajority of such exemplars do involve the explicit use of computers.\nOn the other hand, it is not uncommon for mathematicians also to cite\none or more historical examples, from well before the computer age, to\nillustrate the purported pedigree of the subdiscipline.\n\nThe biggest practice-based challenge to equating experimental\nmathematics with computer-based mathematics comes from what\nself-styled experimental mathematicians say about their nascent\ndiscipline. For when mathematicians self-consciously reflect on the\nnotion of experimental mathematics, they tend to reject the claim that\ncomputer use is a necessary feature. For example, the editors of the\njournal Experimental Mathematics\u2014in their\n\u201cstatement of philosophy\u201d concerning the scope and nature\nof the journal\u2014make the following remarks:\n\nThe word \u201cexperimental\u201d is conceived broadly: many\nmathematical experiments these days are carried out on computers, but\nothers are still the result of pencil-and-paper work, and there are\nother experimental techniques, like building physical\n models. (\u201cAims and Scope\u201d, Experimental Mathematics\u2014see Other Internet Resources)\n \n\nAnd here is another passage with a similar flavor from mathematician\nDoron Zeilberger:\n\n[T]raditional experimental mathematics \u2026 has been pursued by\nall the great, and less-great, mathematicians through the centuries,\nusing pencil-and-paper. (Gallian and Pearson 2007, 14)\n\n\nIt seems fair to say that tying experimental mathematics to computer\nuse fits well with what contemporary experimental mathematicians do\nbut not so well with what they\n say.[11]\n\nA second problem with the proposed characterization is more\nphilosophical in nature. Consider another widely-cited example of\nexperimental mathematics which arises in connection with\nGoldbach\u2019s Conjecture. As of April 2007, all even numbers up to\n1018 had been verified to conform to GC, and this project\n(under the direction of Oliveira e Silva) is ongoing. This massive\ncomputation task is generally considered to be a paradigm example of\nexperimental mathematics. And it seems clear that computers are\nplaying an essential role here: no mathematician, or group of\nmathematicians, could hope to duplicate 1018 calculations\nby hand.\n\nIn the current context, the central question is not whether\ncomputer-based mathematics is \u2018experimental\u2019 but whether\nit is\u2014at least sometimes\u2014non-deductive. In one\nsense, of course, all of the individual calculations performed by a\ncomputer are deductive, or at least they are isomorphic to the\noperations of a purely deductive formal system. When a computer\nverifies an instance of GC, this verification is completely deductive.\nWe may then separate out two distinct questions. Firstly, are these\ncomputations playing a non-deductive role in some larger mathematical\nargument? And, secondly, are the beliefs we form directly from the\nresults of computer computations deductively grounded beliefs? The\nfirst of these questions does not turn on anything specific to\ncomputers, and hence collapses back to the issue discussed in Section\n3(B) above on enumerative induction. The second question will be\nexamined below.\n\nPhilosophical discussion of the status of computer proofs was prompted\nin large part by Appel and Haken\u2019s computer-based proof of the\nFour Color Theorem in 1976. In his (1979), Tymoczko\nargues\u2014controversially\u2014that mathematical knowledge based\non computer proofs is essentially empirical in character. This is\nbecause such proofs are not a priori, not certain, not\nsurveyable, and not checkable by human mathematicians. In all these\nrespects, according to Tymoczko, computer proofs are unlike\ntraditional \u2018pencil-and-paper\u2019 proofs. Concerning\nsurveyability, Tymoczko writes:\n\nA proof is a construction that can be looked over, reviewed, verified\nby a rational agent. We often say that a proof must be perspicuous, or\ncapable of being checked by hand. It is an exhibition, a derivation of\nthe conclusion, and it needs nothing outside itself to be convincing.\nThe Mathematician surveys the proof in its entirety and\nthereby comes to know the conclusion. (Tymoczko 1979, 59)\n\n\nAssume for sake of argument that the computer proof in question is\ndeductively correct but is also unsurveyable in the above sense. Does\nour decision to rely on the output of the computer here constitute a\nnon-deductive method? One way of viewing this kind of example\nis as driving a wedge between a deductive method and our non-deductive\naccess to the results of that method. Compare, for instance,\nbeing told of a particular mathematical result by an expert\nmathematician (with a good track record). Is this a\n\u2018non-deductive\n method\u2019?[12]\n",
