    "main_text": "The Kal\u0101m Cosmological Argument || Impossibility of an Actual Infinite\n7.2 Impossibility of an Actual Infinite\n\nIn defense of premise 2, Craig develops both a priori and\na posteriori arguments. His primary a priori\nargument is\n\nAn actual infinite cannot exist.\nA beginningless temporal series of events is an actual\ninfinite.\nTherefore, a beginningless temporal series of events\ncannot exist.\n\n\nSince conclusion 8 follows validly, if premises 6 and 7 are true the\nargument is sound. In defense of premise 6, he defines an actual\ninfinite as a determinate totality that occurs when a part of a system\ncan be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the entire system\n(Craig and Sinclair 2009: 104). Craig argues that if actual infinites\nthat neither increase nor decrease in the number of members they\ncontain were to really exist, rather absurd consequences would result.\nFor example, imagine a library with an actually infinite number of\nbooks. Suppose that the library also contains an infinite number of\nred and an infinite number of black books, so that for every red book\nthere is a black book, and vice versa. It follows that the library\ncontains as many red books as the total books in its collection and as\nmany red books as red and black books combined. However, this is\nabsurd; in reality the subset cannot be equivalent to the entire set.\nLikewise, in a real library by removing a certain number of books we\nreduce the overall collection. However, if infinites are actual, a\nlibrary with an infinite number of books would not be reduced in size\nat all by removal of a specific number of books (short of all of them\nor all but a specific number), for example, all the red books or those\nwith even catalogue numbers (Craig and Smith 1993: 11\u201316). The\nabsurdities resulting from attempting to apply basic arithmetical\noperations, functional in the real world, to infinities suggest that\nalthough actual infinites can have an ideal existence, they cannot\nreally exist.\n\nCraig\u2019s point is this. Two sets \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are the same\nsize just in case they can be put into one-to-one correspondence, that\nis, if and only if every member of \\(A\\) can be correlated with\nexactly one member of \\(B\\) in such a way that no member of \\(B\\) is\nleft out. In the case of infinite sets, this notion of \u201csame\nsize\u201d yields results like the following: the set of all natural\nnumbers (let this be \\(A\\)) is the same size as the set of squares of\nnatural numbers (\\(B\\)), since every member of \\(A\\) can be correlated\nwith exactly one member of \\(B\\) in a way that leaves out no member of\n\\(B\\) (correlate \\(0\\leftrightarrow 0\\), \\(1\\leftrightarrow1\\),\n\\(2\\leftrightarrow4\\), \\(3\\leftrightarrow9\\), \\(4\\leftrightarrow\n16\\),\u2026). This is a case\u2014recognized in fact as early as\nGalileo (Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences)\u2014where\ntwo infinite sets have the same size but, intuitively, one of them, as\na proper subset, appears to be smaller than the other.\n\nCraig uses a similar, intuitive notion of \u201csmaller than\u201d\nin his argument concerning the library. It appears that the set \\(B\\)\nof red books in the library is smaller than the set \\(A\\) of all the\nbooks in the library, even though both have the same (infinite) size.\nCraig concludes that it is absurd to suppose that such a library is\npossible in actuality, since the set of red books would\nsimultaneously have to be smaller than the set of all books and yet\nequal in size.\n\nCritics fail to be convinced by these paradoxes of infinity. For\nexample, Rundle (2004: 170) agrees with Craig that the concept of an\nactual infinite is paradoxical, but this, he argues, provides no\ngrounds for thinking it is incoherent. The logical problems with the\nactual infinite are not problems of incoherence but arise from the\nfeatures that are characteristic of infinite sets. When the intuitive\nnotion of \u201csmaller than\u201d is replaced by a precise\ndefinition, finite sets and infinite sets just behave somewhat\ndifferently, that is all. Cantor and all subsequent set theorists\ndefine a set \\(B\\) to be smaller than set \\(A\\) (i.e., has fewer\nmembers) just in case \\(B\\) is the same size as a subset of \\(A\\), but\n\\(A\\) is not the same size as any subset of \\(B\\). The application of\nthis definition to finite and infinite sets yields results that Craig\nfinds counter-intuitive but which mathematicians see as our best\nunderstanding for comparing the size of sets. They see the fact that\nan infinite set can be put into one-to-one correspondence with one of\nits own proper subsets as one of the defining characteristics\nof an infinite set, not an absurdity. Say that set \\(C\\) is a\nproper subset of \\(A\\) just in case every element of \\(C\\) is\nan element of \\(A\\) while \\(A\\) has some element that is not an\nelement of \\(C\\). In finite sets, but not necessarily in infinite\nsets, when set \\(B\\) is a proper subset of \\(A\\), \\(B\\) is smaller\nthan \\(A\\). However, this does not necessarily hold for infinite\nsets\u2014as above where \\(B\\) is the set of squares of natural\nnumbers and \\(A\\) is the set of all natural numbers. The proper subset\n\\(B\\) might be \u201csmaller\u201d than \\(A\\). What is crucial is\nthat \\(B\\) is not smaller in the sense of having a smaller number of\nmembers than \\(A\\) (i.e., a smaller cardinality).\n\nCantorian mathematicians argue that these results apply to any\ninfinite set, whether in pure mathematics, imaginary libraries, or the\nreal world series of concrete events. Thus, Smith argues that Craig\nbegs the question by wrongly presuming that an intuitive relationship\nholds between finite sets and their proper subsets, namely, that a set\nhas more members than its proper subsets must hold even in the case of\ninfinite sets (Smith, in Craig and Smith 1993: 85). So while Craig\nthinks that Cantor\u2019s set theoretic definitions yield absurdities\nwhen applied to the world of concrete objects, which entails that\ninfinites cannot be actual, set theorists see no problem so long as\nthe proper definitions are maintained. Further discussion is in Oppy\n2006: 137\u201354.\n\nLoke (2017: 55\u201361; see Craig and Sinclair, 2009: 105\u20136)\nreplies to the above objections by arguing that what is mathematically\npossible is not always metaphysically possible. For example, the\nquadratic equation \\(x^2=4\\) can have two mathematically consistent\nresults for \\(x\\): 2 or \u22122, but if the question is \u201chow\nmany people carried the box home\u201d, the answer cannot be\n\u22122, for in the concrete world it is metaphysically impossible\nthat \u22122 people carry a box home. Thus, the conclusion of 2\npeople rather than \u22122 people derives not from mathematical\nequations alone but also from metaphysical considerations. Loke\nproceeds to argue that concrete infinities violate metaphysically\nnecessary truths concerning causal powers. \n\nCraig is well aware of the fact that he is using actual and potential\ninfinite in a way that differs from the traditional usage in Aristotle\nand Aquinas [Craig and Sinclair 2009: 115. For Aristotle, all the\nelements in an actual infinite exist simultaneously, whereas a\npotential infinite is realized over time by addition or division.\nHence, the temporal series of events, as formed by successively adding\nnew events, was a potential, not an actual, infinite (Aristotle,\nPhysics, III, 6)]. For Craig, however, an actual infinite is\na timeless totality that cannot be added to or reduced. \u201cSince\npast events, as determinate parts of reality, are definite and\ndistinct and can be numbered, they can be conceptually collected into\na totality\u201d (Craig, in Craig and Smith 1993: 25). The future,\nbut not the past, is a potential infinite, for its events have not yet\nhappened.\n\nTurning to\n premise 7,\n why should one think that it is true that a beginningless series,\nsuch as the universe up to this point, is an actual rather than a\npotential infinite? For Craig, an actual infinite is a determinate\ntotality or a completed unity, whereas the potential infinite is not.\nSince the past events of a beginningless series can be conceptually\ncollected together and numbered, the series is a determinate totality\n(1979: 96\u201397). And since the past is beginningless, it has no\nstarting point and is infinite. If the universe had a starting point,\nso that events were added to or subtracted from this point, we would\nhave a potential infinite that increased through time by adding new\nmembers. The fact that the events do not occur simultaneously is\nirrelevant.\n\nBede Rundle rejects an actual infinite. His grounds for doing so (the\nsymmetry of the past and the future), if sustained, make\n  premise 7\n false. He argues that the reasons often advanced for asymmetry, such\nas those given by Craig, are faulty. It is true that the past is not\nactual, but neither is the future. Likewise, that the past, having\noccurred, is unalterable is irrelevant, for neither is the future\nalterable. The only time that is real is the present. \n\nFor Rundle, the past and the future are symmetrical; it is only our\nknowledge of them that is asymmetrical. Any future event lies at a\nfinite temporal distance from the present. Similarly, any past event\nlies at a finite temporal distance from the present. For each past or\nfuture event, beginning from the present, there can always be either a\nprior past event or a subsequent future event. Hence, for both series\nan infinity of events is possible, and, as symmetrical, the infinity\nof both series is the same. Since the series of future events is not\nan actual but a potential infinite (or, better, an \u201cindefinitely\nextendible\u201d series, 2004: 168; Craig and Sinclair 2012,\n104\u20135), the series of past events is also indefinitely\nextendible. It follows that although the future is actually finite, it\ndoes not require an end to the universe, for there is always a\npossible subsequent event (2004: 180). Similarly, although any given\npast event of the universe is finitely distant in time from now, a\nbeginning or initial event can be ruled out; for any given event there\nis a possible earlier event. However, since there is a possible prior\nor possible posterior event in any past or future series respectively,\nthe universe, although finite in time, is temporally unbounded\n(indefinitely extendible); both beginning and cessation are ruled out.\n[How Rundle (2004: 176\u201378) gets from the possibility of a\nsubsequent event to actually ruling out cessation and beginning is\nunclear.] Since there is no time when the material universe did not\nexist, it is not contingent but necessary. Hence, although the\nprinciple of sufficient reason is still true, it applies only to the\ncomponents of the material universe and not to the universe itself. No\nexplanation of the universe is possible. The universe, as\nmatter-energy, is neither caused nor destructible, not in the sense\nthat it could have been caused or could cease, but in the sense that\n\u201cthe notions of beginning and ceasing to exist are inapplicable\nto the universe\u201d (2004: 178).\n\nHowever, one might wonder, are the past series and future series of\nevents really symmetrical? It is true that one can start from the\npresent and count either forward or backward in time. Rundle thinks\nthat \u2026\\(x_5\\), \\(x_4\\), \\(x_3\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_1\\), \\(t_0\\),\n\\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), \\(y_3\\), \\(y_4\\), \\(y_5\\) are all on the same\ncontinuum, so that we cannot distinguish ontologically the time\ndimension of the future and past series. The two series, going into\nthe past and into the future, would be the same in that however far we\ncount from the present \\(t_0\\) remains finite although indefinitely\nextendible. However, is it true that, as he claims, with regard to the\npast, \u201cany movement currently terminating can be redescribed as\nextending back\u201d, that counting backward from the present is the\nsame as counting from the past to the present (2004: 176)?\n\nCraig says no, for in the actual world we do not start from now to\narrive at the past; we move from the past to the present. To count\nbackwards, we would start from a particular point in time, the\npresent. From where would we start to count forward were the past\nindefinitely extendible? Both to count and to move from the past to\nthe present, we cannot start from the indefinitely extendible. Indeed,\nif the past is indefinitely extendible, no matter where we started, we\nwould have arrived at \\(t_0\\) long before now. \n\nOne cannot just reverse the temporal sequence of the past, for we do\nnot ontologically engage the sequence from the present to the past.\nRundle\u2019s two movements are quite disparate, such that the two\nsequences\u2014of the past and of the future\u2014are not\nsymmetrical, which leaves intact Craig\u2019s claim that a\nbeginningless past would result in an actual and not a potential\ninfinite.\n\nMorriston (2010) constructs an argument to show that, contrary to\nCraig, there is no relevant difference between a beginningless past\nand a determinate, endless future, such that if one is impossible\nbecause of absurdities so is the other, and if one is possible so is\nthe other. He creates a fictional scenario where God commands angels\nGabriel and Uriel to praise God alternatively for an eternity. \n\n\nIf you ask, \u201cHow many distinct praises will be said?\u201d, the\nonly sensible answer is, \u201cinfinitely many.\u2026 Each of\ninfinitely many distinct praises will be said, precisely because there\nwill be no future time at which all have been said \u201d. (Morriston\n2010: 443\u201344)\n\n\nHowever, an actually infinite number of future events is not\nimpossible; it can be envisioned and determined by God. \n\nMorriston proceeds to note that puzzles or absurdities parallel to\nthose Craig finds in the concept of an actual infinite of past events\nalso occur in the infinite series of future events. Suppose that \n\n\nGod could instead have determined that Gabriel and Uriel will stop\nafter praise number four. Infinitely many praises would be prevented,\nand the number of their future praises would be only four.\nAlternatively, God could have determined that Gabriel be silent during\nall the celestial minutes between Uriel\u2019s future praises. In\nthis case too, infinitely many praises would be prevented, but the\nnumber of future praises would instead be infinite. (Morriston 2010:\n444) \n\n\nAlthough this shows that an infinite future can have inconsistent\nimplications, God could still bring it about that these angels utter\ndistinct praises, one after another, ad infinitum. But then, Morriston\nconcludes, since these inconsistent implications do not count against\nan actual infinity of future events, the puzzles Craig poses do not\ncount against the possibility of an actual infinity of past events,\ni.e., a beginningless universe. If an infinite future is possible, as\nCraig concedes, so is an infinite past. \n\nMorriston contends that Craig\u2019s reply that in the one case the\nevents have occurred and in the other they have not, and hence that\nthe number of future praises is indefinite, is a distinction without a\ndifference. God can determine that an infinite number of praises will\nbe sung. \n\n\nThe non-existence of past events does not prevent us from asking how\nmany have occurred. Nor should the non-existence of future events\nprevent us from asking how many will occur. In neither case will\n\u201cindefinitely many\u201d do as an answer. (2010: 449) \n\n\nCraig\u2019s defense is that Morriston has ignored the difference\nbetween a potential and an actual infinite. According to Craig, an\nactual infinite is a collection of definite and discrete members whose\nnumber is greater than any natural number, whereas a potential\ninfinite is a collection that is increasing toward but never arriving\nat infinity as a limit (Craig 2010; Craig and Sinclair 2009: 116).\n\n\nMorriston objects to Craig\u2019s definition of the potential\ninfinite. For one thing, there is no limit to which the future praises\ngrow. The collection of praises continues to grow as the praises are\nsung, but it does not approach a limit, for always one more praise can\nbe sung. The series of future praises is actually infinite. \n\nCraig responds that Morriston is really attacking his notion of a\npotential infinite by claiming that no relevant distinction exists\nbetween a potential and an actual infinite. But this, he says, rests\non confusing an A-theory with a B-theory of time. An infinite directed\ntoward the future would be actual only on a B-theory of time, but not\non an A-theory (Craig 2010: 452\u201353). On an A-theory of time, a\nchange of tense makes a difference. That something actually has\nhappened differs significantly from what may (even if determined)\nhappen. \n\nCohen (2015: 177) continues Morriston\u2019s argument, insisting that\nCraig invokes an unmotivated principle that Cohen terms the \u201cThe\nActuality-Infinity Principle: In order for x to be actually\ninfinite in quantity, x must be actual\u201d. Cohen argues\nthat this begs the question. However, Craig\u2019s principle is\ndifferent: In order for x to be actually infinite in quantity,\nx must be or have been actual or actualized (Craig 2010:\n455\u201356). Cohen might respond, \u201cWhy not then say that for\nx to be actually infinite in quality x must be, have\nbeen, or will be actual or actualized?\u201d Cohen argues that\nCraig\u2019s presentism does not assist him here, since neither the\npast nor the future events are present and hence do not exist. Craig\nthinks otherwise (Craig and Sinclair 2009: 126), tacitly defending the\nprinciple in that temporal becoming sees to it that what has not\noccurred or is not occurring but as future is merely potential, even\nif determined or foreseen by God. \n",
