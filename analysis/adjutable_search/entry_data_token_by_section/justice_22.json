    "main_text": "Egalitarianism and Justice\n6. Egalitarianism and Justice\n\nIn the recent past, many philosophers have sought to establish a close\nconnection between justice and equality: they ask the question\n\u2018what kind of equality does justice require?\u2019, and to that\nseveral competing answers have been given (see, for example Cohen\n1989, Dworkin 2000, Sen 1980). But we should not be too hasty to\nassume that what justice demands is always equality, whether of\ntreatment or of outcome. Perhaps it does so only in a formal sense. As\nwe saw in sect 1.3, justice requires the impartial and consistent\napplication of rules, from which it follows that when two people are\nalike in all relevant respects, they must be treated equally. But, as\nAristotle among others saw, justice also involves the idea of\nproportional treatment, which implies recipients getting unequal\namounts of whatever good is at issue (Aristotle, Nicomachean\nEthics, Book V, ch. 3). If A is twice as deserving or\ntwice as needy as B, justice may require that she receives more\nthan B does. So here formal equality of treatment \u2013 the\nsame rule applied to both \u2013 leads to an unequal outcome. Again,\nwhen justice takes the conservative form of respect for existing\nentitlements or legitimate expectations (see para 2.1) there is no\nreason to anticipate that what is due to different people will be\nsubstantively the same.\n",
