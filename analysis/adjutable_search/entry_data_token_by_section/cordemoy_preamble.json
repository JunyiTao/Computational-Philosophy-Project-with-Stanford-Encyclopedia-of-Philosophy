    "main_text": "\n\nG\u00e9raud de Cordemoy (1626\u20131684) was one of the more\nimportant Cartesian philosophers during the decades immediately\nfollowing the death of Descartes. While he is in some respects a very\northodox Cartesian, Cordemoy was the only Cartesian to embrace\natomism, and one of the first to argue for occasionalism. Though a\nlawyer by profession, Cordemoy was a prominent figure in Parisian\nphilosophical circles. His two most important works are Le\nDiscernement du corps et de l\u2019\u00e2me (1666) and his\nDiscours physique de la parole (1668). In the former he\ndefends atomism, mechanism, occasionalism, and dualism; the latter is\na study of the nature of speech.\n",
