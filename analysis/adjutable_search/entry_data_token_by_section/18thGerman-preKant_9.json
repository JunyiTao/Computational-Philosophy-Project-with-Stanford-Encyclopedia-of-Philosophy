    "main_text": "Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten || Philosophy\n4.2 Philosophy\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s metaphysics is frequently characterized as\ninclining more towards Leibniz than to the\n\u201cLeibnizian-Wolffian\u201d philosophy; for instance, he makes\nexplicit reference to monads in his presentation of ontology and\ncosmology, and concerning the pre-established harmony he accepts that\nit obtains between all substances (not just between soul and body) and\ndoes not qualify his endorsement of the system as Wolff came to do\n(Baumgarten 1739: \u00a7761\u20139; cf. Watkins 2005: 73\u201381 for\ndiscussion). While there is no doubt that Baumgarten adopts a\nfundamentally Leibnizian picture in his ontology, including the\nendorsement of the principle of sufficient reason, to leave it at this\nwould be to ignore the important and fruitful role that his Pietist\nbackground plays in his philosophical thought (Look 2018). Indeed,\nBaumgarten\u2019s originality as a thinker consists in his efforts to\namend key planks of Leibnizian (and Wolffian) thinking in light of his\nunderlying Pietist commitments.\n\nThis is particularly evident in Baumgarten\u2019s treatment of\nfreedom and immortality, where Wolff\u2019s position on each was\ntargeted by his Pietist critics. By way of addressing the Pietist\nobjections to Wolff\u2019s moral intellectualism and his reduction of\nfreedom to mere spontaneity, Baumgarten offers an enriched empirical\npsychology, one that considers the influence of expectations of the\nfuture (and a future life) as motives, that allows that immoral action\ncan proceed not only from ignorance but also from less lively\ncognition of the good, and that explicitly distinguishes spontaneity\nfrom freedom proper (Schwaiger 2011: 82\u201392). On the topic of\nimmortality, the Pietists had likewise objected to Wolff\u2019s\nemphasis on the human soul\u2019s preservation of its\ncognitive capacities in the afterlife, which state seems for\nWolff to be disconnected to the human\u2019s cultivation of virtue\nand piety in this life. Baumgarten seeks to rectify this by arguing\nthat in addition to preserving its cognitive capacities in the\nafterlife, the soul will also retain its moral capacities including\nfreedom, and that its condition of blessedness or damnation in the\nlife to come will be a direct function of its moral condition (1739:\n\u00a7\u00a7782, 791; Dyck 2018).\n\nConsistent with his orientation in metaphysics, Baumgarten is an\noriginal moral philosopher within the Wolffian tradition. He is\nnotable, for instance, for the centrality of the notion of obligation\nin his ethics. Wolff had framed a novel concept of obligation, rooted\nin the nature of things and actions themselves rather than the will of\na sovereign, in accordance with which an obligation arises simply\ninsofar as some motive is naturally connected to an action (GE\n\u00a79). Yet, whereas Wolff only treats obligation briefly before\nconsidering specific duties, in Baumgarten\u2019s hands the problem\nof obligation becomes the unifying theme for ethics, particularly in\nhis Initia (Schwaiger 2009). Moreover, while Baumgarten\naccepts Wolff\u2019s ethical perfectionism, in contrast with Wolff he\ndownplays the connection between perfection and happiness, perhaps in\nresponse to Pietist denunciations of Wolff\u2019s perfectionism as a\nveiled form of hedonism (Schwaiger 2011: 163ff; Bacin 2015). A last\ninnovation is Baumgarten\u2019s consideration of the ways in which\nethical systems themselves can be flawed in that, for instance, they\nmake a virtuous condition too easily attainable (flattering ethics) or\nset the bar for virtue too high for human nature (chimerical ethics)\n(Thorndike 2008; Dyck 2012).\n\nTurning finally to Baumgarten\u2019s aesthetics, it is notable that\nwhile Wolff himself had comparatively little to say about the\nphilosophy of art (but see Beiser 2009; and Buchenau 2013), a number\nof thinkers in the Wolffian interest took a keen interest in the\ntopic. The first to develop a theory of the arts, particularly poetry,\nwas Johann Christoph Gottsched (1700\u20131766), who published his\nVersuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor die Deutschen\n(Attempt at a Critical Poetry for the Germans) in 1730.\nTreating poetry scientifically, he set out a set of rules that were to\nguide the composition. Given his conception of what a poem was (a\nmoral fable) and given as well his idea of what was involved in its\ncomposition (a set of rules), there was little room here for beauty\nand even less for sentiment and inspiration.\n\nIt was left to Baumgarten to formulate a recognizably modern aesthetic\ndoctrine on Wolffian foundations. This he did through focusing on the\nsoul\u2019s faculty of sensibility, ultimately identifying aesthetics\nas the science of sensible cognition. Where Wolff had conceived of the\nsenses merely as providing the raw material for thinking, Baumgarten\nthought that the senses had their own rules and their own perfection,\nrules and perfection that differ from logical rules and the knowledge\ngenerated by the process of intellectual clarification. So, while\nrepresentations might be logically perfect and attain to intensive\nclarity insofar as we distinguish a number of marks within it,\nrepresentations of the senses, even as confused representations, can\nattain to extensive clarity inasmuch as they represent a\nmultitude of things (Baumgarten 1735: \u00a717). In this way, poetic\nrepresentation can be richer, and more moving, than representations\nattained through the use of the understanding\u2014moving since\nBaumgarten contends that such representations as (aesthetically)\nperfect can also occasion pleasure in us. One cannot but see the\ninfluence that Baumgarten likely had on Kant\u2019s Critical\nphilosophy \u2014 his vindication of the senses reappears in an\ninherently Kantian way both in the Transcendental Aesthetic of the\nCritique of Pure Reason and in the Critique of the Power\nof Judgment.\n",
