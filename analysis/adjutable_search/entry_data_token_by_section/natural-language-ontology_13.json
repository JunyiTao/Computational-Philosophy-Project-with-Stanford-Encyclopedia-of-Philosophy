    "main_text": "The Issue of Ontologies || The Question of Ontologies\n4.2 The Question of Ontologies\n\nDistinguishing different branches of metaphysics goes hand in hand\nwith the view according to which there is not a single ontology, but\nseveral, at least apparent, ontologies, ontologies pertaining to\nlanguage, to cognition, and to fundamental reality. But there is also\nthe question whether there is in fact a single ontology of natural\nlanguage. When natural language has been used to clarify metaphysical\nintuitions, the presupposition was that metaphysical intuitions do not\nshow interpersonal inconsistencies, which means that there is a unique\nontology reflected in the relevant ways in natural language. There are\nreasons to be skeptical of that presupposition. It is not necessarily\nthe case that there is a single ontology implicit in all natural\nlanguages, just as there may in fact be interpersonal differences\namong intuitions, which have now become the subject of experimental\nphilosophy (see entry on\n experimental philosophy).\n The proper subject matter of natural language ontology should thus be\nthe ontologies of natural languages. The possibility of\ninterlinguistic ontological differences touches touches upon the\nSapir-Whorf hypothesis and the controversy surrounding it (Pinker\n1994; Hespos & Spelke 2004; Pelletier 2011). Of course, it may\nturn out that the ontologies of natural languages are in fact the same\nor at least that there are constraints on how the they may differ from\neach other and what linguistic phenomena (of the lexical or functional\npart of grammar) such differences may pertain to. Assuming a\ndistinction between core and periphery, clearly, if there is a\nuniversal ontology shared by human languages, it should pertain to the\ncore only. Generative linguists may furthermore be interested in such\nconstraints, or a universal ontology, as a way of explaining how the\ngrammar of a language with the ontology that goes along with it can be\nlearned.\n",
