    "main_text": "Life and Works || Influences on Suhrawardi\n1.3 Influences on Suhrawardi\n\nMapping Suhrawardi\u2019s intellectual trajectory and identifying the\nsources he may have used proves difficult, notably because he states\nhe was first a \u2018zealous\u2019 defender of the Peripatetic\ntradition, and was later assisted by those who \u201chave travelled\nthe path of God\u201d and mastered the \u2018science of\nintuition\u2019, the likes of \u201cthe inspired and illuminated\nPlato\u201d, Hermes, Empedocles, Pythagoras, etc. among the Greeks\nand Jamasp, Frashostar, Bozorgmehr, etc. among the Ancient Persians\n(PI, \u00a73; cf. Suh. 1993a, 502\u20134). His philosophical\nproject sought to revive the wisdom (hikma) of the Ancients,\ntapping into this double (Eastern/Western) initiatic genealogy of\nSages and from the Greek and Arab philosophers who threaded the\n\u2018path of God\u2019.\n\nInstructed in the Avicennan Peripatetic tradition, Suhrawardi studied\nthe views of Aristotle, Plato, the Neoplatonists, and later\nphilosophers (falasifa) who wrote in Arabic, notably\nAvicenna\u2019s (d.1037) whose major works remained central. Work is\nstill needed to assess the nature of the influence exerted on him by\nAvicenna\u2019s other works, for instance, his Discussions\n(1992) and Notes on Aristotle\u2019s De anima\n(1984), and by post-Avicennan philosophers, particularly Abu\nal-Barakat al-Baghdadi (d.ca.1165), the original yet eclectic critic\nof Avicenna\u2019s logic, psychology and metaphysics, Fakhr al-Din\nal-Razi (d.1210), and the the innovative Ibn Sahlan al-Sawi (the\nlogician) (d.ca. 1158).\n\nCharting Suhrawardi\u2019s intellectual journey and encounters with\nmysticism, ancient Greek Gnosticism and Hermeticism, or ancient\nPersian Zoroastrian traditions, to whose symbols he often appeals,\nremains exceedingly difficult (Muwahhid 1995). Some have attempted to\ntrace the Greek influences of such figures as Empedocles, Pythagoras,\nHermes, etc. in his work, an exercise that has, for example, rendered\nhim a \u2018Pythagoreanizing Neoplatonist\u2019 (Walbridge 2000,\n2001) with more or less success (Gutas 2003, 308). \n\nSuhrawardi frequently appeals to the authority of Plato. This includes\nmaterial from the Arabic (pseudo)Theology of Aristotle (a\nparaphrase of parts of Books IV-VI of Plotinus\u2019\nEnneads) that he attributes to Plato, perhaps because the\nlatter is mentioned more than once at the end of the first chapter\n(D\u2019Ancona 2004). This is evidenced where Suhrawardi quotes or\nalludes to a passage from the (pseudo)Theology of Aristotle\n(I.21\u201326; cf. Enneads 4.8.1) that he ascribes to Plato\n(PI, \u00a7171; cf. Suh. 1993a, ), a passage to which he\nagain alludes (PI, \u00a7171), and again in summary form in\nhis Intimations (Talwihat) (Suh. 1993a, 112; cf.\nWalbridge, 2000, 134\u2013137; (for a number of specific overlaps,\nsee Arnzen, 2011, 119\u2013150 and Sinai, 2011 [commentary on\n\u00a7\u00a7 4, 94, 109, 129 and 171]). Shahrazuri seems to have known\nthe work as the Kitab al-Mimar (the Arabic term of the\ndivision headings of the work). Moreover, the Theology\ncontains passages (Enneads IV, 8.1) that mention many\nphilosophers of the Greek tradition to which Suhrawardi states being\nthe heir. Why Suhrawardi \u201cpresented himself as\nfollowing these ancient philosophers, and especially Plato, rather\nthan Avicenna\u201d has yet to be elucidated and adequately explained\n(Gutas 2003, 308\u20139). \n\nIn addition, possible influences of Ismailism or Sufism have yet to be\nfully explored: some elements of his ishraqidoctrine may have\nmore affinity with Ismaili thought (such as the hierarchical notion of\nbeing in the works of 10th century Abu Ya\u2018qub\nal-Sijistani) than with the doctrines of classical Sufis whom he\nclaims to be following (Landolt 1987), although similarities with\ncertain Sufi theories have been identified (Landolt 2008,\nforthcoming). Medieval biographers, on the other hand, readily\nreported Suhrawardi\u2019s mystical inclination, his association with\nmystics, his ascetic practices and (hagiographic) wondrous deeds. He\nhimself considered spiritual exercises a necessary preparation for the\nadvent of \u2018presential\u2019 (huduri) knowledge and\nvision of the Lights. \n\nSuhrawardi also appeals to ancient Zoroastrian motifs, terminology and\nmythical figures, even Mazdean theology, for example, in his\nInvocations and Prayers (Suh. 1976; Mo\u2018in 1950; cf.\nGaffari 2001, 375\u201385; see the occult and devotional works\nunearthed by Walbridge 2011). For some, his appeal to angels as\nembodiments of intellective light principles has been likened to\nancient Zoroastrian (Corbin 1971, 111\u20133, 124\u20135) or Mazdean\n(Nasr 1964, 71) angelology; for others, it echoes the angels found in\nAbu al-Barakat al-Baghdadi\u2019s al-Mu\u2018tabar\n(What Has Been Established Through Personal Reflection)\n(1939, vol. 2, 157; cf. Pines 1979, 253\u20135), the latter being\ndevoid of any ancient Persian symbolism. Without any clear historical\nfiliations to particular textual traditions, one can only rely on\nSuhrawardi\u2019s own claims to have intended to provide a synthesis\nof those ancient Western and Eastern intellectual traditions. \n",
