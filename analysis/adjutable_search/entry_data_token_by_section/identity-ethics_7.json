    "main_text": "Contemporary Accounts of Personal Identity || Nonreductionism\n2.7 Nonreductionism \n\n\nWe have just examined the leading contemporary theories of \npersonal identity (or what matters in personal identity), and we have\nalso explored how those views might relate to ethics. But we have \nthus far ignored what may be the most popular theory of identity \noutside philosophy (and a view that a minority of \nphilosophers still accept as well). This is nonreductionism, according to \nwhich persons exist separately and independently from their brains \nand bodies, and so their lives are unified from birth to death in \nvirtue of that separately existing entity, what we will call a \nCartesian ego (but is most popularly thought of as a soul). And \nalthough there is logical space available for a nonreductionism \naccording to which identity isn't what matters for survival \nand our practical concerns, the universal view is instead the \nopposite. Notice, then, that this view implies both a deep unity \nwithin individual lives and a deep disunity between lives. \nAfter all, if what unifies my life is a particular persisting \nego-substance, and that substance is wholly present at every stage of\nmy life, then every temporal slice of my life is just as much a part \nof me as every other, so if prudential concern is grounded in \nidentity, for example, I ought to be equally concerned for every part\nof my life. Further, given that my particular ego-substance is \ndistinct from every other person's particular ego-substance, my \nspecial prudential concern justifiably ends at the boundaries of my \nepidermis (or at the \u201cboundaries\u201d of my ego).\n\n\nNow one important problem for this view is that it is very difficult \nto see why my patterns of concern should track this particular ego, \nand not instead the psychological features constituting Relation R. \nWhat is it about this substance that warrants my special \nprudential concern, for example? If it is in virtue of its function as the \ncarrier of the various psychological connections, then we \nmight well wonder why we shouldn't just care directly for those \nconnections, rather than merely for the \u201chouse\u201d they \nlive in. But if we make that move, then we have already switched to \nreductionism, it seems, and because those direct psychological \nconnections may hold one-many, identity cannot be what matters.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the nonreductionist might insist that I am \njustified in having special concern for my future ego simply insofar \nas it is the only thing that will be me, regardless of \nwhether or not Relation R is preserved by or within it. On this \naccount, then (what Parfit 1984, 228 calls the \u201cFeatureless \nCartesian View\u201d), who I am \u2013 my essential identity \n\u2013 is independent of any particular psychological properties. \nBut if identity is entirely prized apart from psychology in this way,\nand if the ego to be tracked is an immaterial substance (as it is, of\ncourse, on the Cartesian version), we are left with two related \npuzzles. First, if the particular ego I now have (or am) can be \nperceived or identified neither directly, via some empirical means, \nnor indirectly, via a particular set of psychological properties it \nmight be thought to evince, then we actually have no reason to \nbelieve that there is just one such ego unifying the various\nstages of our lives. Instead, our bodies might get a new, \nqualitatively identical ego every year on our birthdays, or perhaps \nevery day, or perhaps there is a river of them flowing through us \nfrom moment to moment. If this were to happen, then I would \ncease to exist, replaced by a qualitatively identical person who then\ninherits my psychological properties. But no one would even notice! \nThis would be rather odd, to say the least, and this is because of \nthe connection we think should obtain between our metaphysical \ncriterion of personal identity and our epistemological criterion of \npersonal identity. In other words, we tend to think there is a close \nconnection between the nature of personal identity and what enables \nus to determine when identity obtains. So if what makes \nX and Y identical is sameness of body, it will also\nbe our reidentification of that body which enables us to determine \nthat X is Y. Similarly, if what makes X \nand Y identical is some kind of psychological continuity, \nthen determining that X and Y are identical will be\na matter of determining whether psychological continuity obtains \nbetween them. Now in both the body and the psychology cases, we have \nthe capacity to do the tracking in question. If the Featureless \nCartesian View is correct, though, we do not. We cannot track \nimmaterial egos floating free from any particular psychological \nproperties, so on this view we would never be justified in claiming \nto have reidentified anyone, nor would we be justified in claiming \nspecial concern for some future stage of our bodies: in both cases, \nwe could have no reason whatsoever for thinking that the persons in \nquestion were who we thought they were (Perry 1978, 6\u201318; Parfit \n1984, 228).\n\n\nNow the defender of the view might maintain that, given the\ncorrectness of the metaphysical criterion, we should simply abandon\nour desire for epistemic access to identity. And it is indeed the case\nthat this version of nonreductionism could be true: There is simply no\nway to show that I am not, after all, an essentially immaterial\nsubstance unattached to any particular psychological properties. But\nif this true, and there becomes no way to make justified judgments of\nidentity, then the second problem is that the theory is\njust irrelevant for all practical purposes. We in fact make\njudgments of identity and reidentification based on physical and\npsychological properties \u2013 we lack the capacity to do anything\nelse \u2013 so even if the Featureless Cartesian View were true, it\nwould be useless in addressing any of our practical concerns. If,\nthen, we want to articulate a useful relation between\npersonal identity and ethics, we may have to abandon nonreductionism,\nor at least nonreductionism of the \u201cseparately existing\nentities\u201d sort (technically, Schechtman's Anthropological View\nis a non-reductionist view, as it does insist that the facts about\nidentity consist in facts beyond just facts about brains and bodies,\nbut these aren't non-trackable facts like those of the Featureless\nCartesian; they are instead facts about social treatment and\nengagement).\n",
