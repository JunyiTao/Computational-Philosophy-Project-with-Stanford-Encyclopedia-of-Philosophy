    "main_text": "Basics || Theories of Word Meaning\n1.2 Theories of Word Meaning\n\nAs with general theories of meaning (see the entry on\n theories of meaning),\n two kinds of theory of word meaning can be distinguished. The first\nkind, which we can label a semantic theory of word meaning,\nis a theory interested in clarifying what meaning-determining\ninformation is encoded by the words of a natural language. A framework\nestablishing that the word \u2018bachelor\u2019 encodes the lexical\nconcept adult unmarried\nmale would be an example of a semantic theory of word meaning.\nThe second kind, which we can label a foundational theory of\nword meaning, is a theory interested in elucidating the facts in\nvirtue of which words come to have the semantic properties they have\nfor their users. A framework investigating the dynamics of semantic\nchange and social coordination in virtue of which the word\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 is assigned the function of expressing the\nlexical concept adult\nunmarried male would be an example of a foundational theory of\nword meaning. Likewise, it would be the job of a foundational theory\nof word meaning to determine whether words have the semantic\nproperties they have in virtue of social conventions, or whether\nsocial conventions do not provide explanatory purchase on the facts\nthat ground word meaning (see the entry on\n convention).\n\nObviously, the endorsement of a given semantic theory is bound to\nplace important constraints on the claims one might propose about the\nfoundational attributes of word meaning, and vice versa.\nSemantic and foundational concerns are often interdependent, and it is\ndifficult to find theories of word meaning which are either purely\nsemantic or purely foundational. According to Ludlow (2014), for\nexample, the fact that word meaning is systematically underdetermined\n(a semantic matter) can be explained in part by looking at the\nprocesses of linguistic negotiation whereby discourse partners\nconverge on the assignment of shared meanings to the words of their\nlanguage (a foundational matter). However, semantic and foundational\ntheories remain in principle different and designed to answer partly\nnon-overlapping sets of questions.\n\nOur focus in this entry will be on semantic theories of word\nmeaning, i.e., on theories that try to provide an answer to such\nquestions as \u201cwhat is the nature of word meaning?\u201d,\n\u201cwhat do we know when we know the meaning of a word?\u201d, and\n\u201cwhat (kind of) information must a speaker associate to the\nwords of a language in order to be a competent user of its\nlexicon?\u201d. However, we will engage in foundational\nconsiderations whenever necessary to clarify how a given framework\naddresses issues in the domain of a semantic theory of word\nmeaning.\n",
