    "main_text": "Exceptions to informed consent\n7. Exceptions to informed consent\n\nEven absent own-waivers, and despite absolutist statements of the\ninformed consent requirement, such as the Nuremberg Code, many\ncontemporary theorists agree that there are cases where informed\nconsent procedures are not necessary. The law, and many bioethicists,\nrecognize exceptions to informed consent requirements, such as lack of\ndecision-making capacity, or emergency circumstances where the\npatient\u2019s wishes are unknown (T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 1999; Emanuel,\nWendler, and Grady 2000). That said, these exceptions serve the spirit\nof informed consent; they can be plausibly woven into full statements\nof the requirement (as proposed, for instance, in Dworkin 1988, 117),\nand they question only its crudest, most absolutist statements. Other\nexceptions seem harder to reconcile with full-blown commitment to\ninformed consent and its central justifications. Let us discuss,\nspecifically, the extent to which informed consent is needed in (1)\nbenign care and benign experiments, (2) certain risky experiments, and\n(3) public health policy. We shall then present the general question,\n(4) When is informed consent needed?\n",
