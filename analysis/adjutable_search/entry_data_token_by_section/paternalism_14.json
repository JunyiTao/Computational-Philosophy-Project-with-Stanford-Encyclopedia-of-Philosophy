    "main_text": "Libertarian Paternalism || Manipulation\n5. Paternalistic Lies \n\nThere is one class of manipulation which clearly raises issues about whether the person\nbeing manipulated had had their autonomy and/or liberty interfered with--lies. Lies motivated\nby the claim that the person being lied to will have her interests advanced are the most common\nexamples of paternalism that are claimed to be, at least sometimes, justified. \n\nPaternalistic lies, and other forms of deception such as truthful but misleading assertions, raise interesting conceptual as well as normative issues.  Unlike coercion which makes certain\nchoices more costly, and hence restricts agents\u2019 options, many lies make it more difficult for the\nagent to take certain options without increasing their cost. Further this difficulty is hidden from the person being lied to. This raises the issue of what exactly are the features of the\nperson being lied to which are affected.  Is it her liberty, her freedom, her autonomy? Is it\nthe voluntariness of her action? Is it none of these things but something like her ability to\naccomplish her aims? Thinking about these questions is important in evaluating whether, and when,\npaternalistic lies are justifiable. \n\n\n\nThis discussion is about lying not deception. One can deceive without\nlying, e.g. by asserting something which you believe true but from\nwhich you know that the hearer will infer something false.  Or by not\nasserting at all as when a husband replaces his sleeping pills with\ncough medicine to prevent his wife from harming herself.  By a lie I\nmean an assertion P by A who does not believe\nthat P and intends a listener to either come to believe that\nP or at least to believe that A believes\nthat P.\n\nA lie may not in fact deceive the listener for many\nreasons\u2014P might actually be true or the listener may be\naware that she is being lied to\u2014but it is still pro tanto wrong\nas an abuse of assertion whose function is to provide evidence of what\nthe speaker takes to be the truth. Paternalistic lies are prima facie\nwrong, as Kantians would claim, because they are violations of our\nright as rational creatures to determine our ends, and the means to\nobtain them, for ourselves. \n\nSince lying is pro tanto wrong any specific lie can turn out to be\njustified if there are reasons that outweigh the ones making it\nwrong. And defenders of paternalistic lies argue there are sometimes\nharms avoided or goods produced that outweigh the harms of\nlying. Anti-paternalists argue that such calculations fail to take\ninto account that lies interfere with important values such as the\nautonomy, liberty, and rationality of the person and these values may\noutweigh the harms avoided or goods produced. \n\nLet us start with autonomy. Does being lied to interfere with, or diminish the autonomy of the\nperson being lied to?  Obviously to answer this we need to be given an understanding of what it is for a person to be, or to act, autonomously. For example, if we understand autonomy as a\ngeneral characteristic of a person\u2019s relationship to their goals, ideals, preferences, values, and so forth then the lie must affect that relationship. If the lie, for example, asserts that some value, e.g. politeness, causes mostly misery, then their autonomy understood as self-reflection on how they should live is undermined. \n\nIf, on the other hand, the lie is relevant to how, given their ends, they can best attain them\nthen what is diminished is their likelihood of achieving their autonomously chosen ends, or of\nacting in accordance with their values. Their capacity for reflective acceptance remains intact.\n\nAt the level of choosing what to do in order to attain goals, or promote ends, or acting in accordance with values, being lied to diminishes the likelihood of achieving\nany of these.  Is this failure also to be considered a diminishment of autonomy? \n\nFirst, it should be noted that being lied to does not, and is not always intended to, affect choices.  When a doctor falsely tells a patient that he does not have a fatal disease she is\ntrying to prevent the patient from becoming depressed. It is mood not particular choices that are at issue. \n\nSecond, it not clear that having choices fail because of a lie affects autonomy. If it does\nthen whenever a person, out of ignorance, has their choice fail they have acted non-autonomously.\nBut it is not obvious that when I choose a medicine on the basis of inaccurate information, and\nfail to get cured, that my choice of the medicine was not autonomous. Perhaps it is the voluntariness of my choice that is affected.\n\nOne way to think about this is to consider the exercise of autonomy in a given choice as requiring freedom as non-interference. This assume the actor is autonomous in some basic\ncapacity sense. And non-interference is then analyzed in terms of what makes one\u2019s choices more costly(coercion) or more difficult(deception) to pursue.\n\nAn interesting case to think about is the prescribing of placebos. In the typical case the\ndoctor is mis-leading the patient about the inert nature of the medication. But he is doing\nso because there is good reason to think that the patient will be better off for having\ntaken the placebo. The patient's practical reasoning is distorted by the lie so something\nimportant for autonomy is removed but the patient's welfare is increased.\n\nIn conclusion it seems clear that lying interferes with something significant concerning the choices and actions of the person lied to and in doing so acts prima facie wrongly. But being clearer about what is, and what what is not, diminished by paternalistic lies needs further\ninvestigation in order to evaluate the legitimacy of such lies.  \n",
