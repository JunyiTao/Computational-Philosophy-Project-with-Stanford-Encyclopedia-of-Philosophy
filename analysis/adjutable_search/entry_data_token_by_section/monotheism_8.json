    "main_text": "Are the \u201cMonotheistic Traditions\u201d Really Monotheistic? || The Kabbalah and Monotheism\n7.1 The Kabbalah and Monotheism\n\n\nConsider the Kabbalah, for example. The Zohar (after 1275)\nidentifies the first principle with the En Sof or infinite (unlimited).\nThe En Sof is \u201cthe hidden God\u201d or \u201cinnermost\nbeing\u201d of God, without attributes or qualities. Because it lacks\nattributes, the En Sof is incomprehensible and thus, in a strict sense,\nnon-personal (although it reveals itself as personal).\n\n\nThe hidden God manifests itself in the sefirot, however. These are\nconceived as God\u2019s attributes, or as divine spheres or realms, or as\nstages (in his self-manifestation). They are also regarded as names\nwhich God gives himself, and together form his \u201cone great\nname,\u201d or as God\u2019s faces or garments, or as beams of his light.\nThey are also sometimes pictured as the branches of a tree whose root\nis the En Sof, \u201cthe hidden root of roots.\u201d (Alternatively,\nthe En Sof is depicted as the sap that circulates through, and\nmaintains, the branches.) These branches are thought of as extending\nthrough the whole of the created order; created things exist solely in\nvirtue of the fact that \u201cthe power of the sefirot lives and acts in\nthem.\u201d\n\n\nThere are ten sefirot or stages in God\u2019s self-manifestation. A brief\ndiscussion of the first three will be sufficient for our purposes. The\nfirst is, perhaps surprisingly, characterized as Nothing or the Abyss.\n(We are said to catch glimpses of it when things alter their form or\ndisappear; when things change or are destroyed, Nothingness or the\nAbyss becomes \u201cvisible\u201d for \u201ca fleeting \u2026\nmoment.\u201d) This mystical no-thing-ness is God\u2019s Supreme Crown.\n\n\nBoth Wisdom and Intelligence emerge or emanate from the Crown.\nWisdom is the \u201cideal thought\u201d of everything that will\nemerge in creation. The idea exists at this stage in a confused and\nundifferentiated form, however. Wisdom is sometimes pictured as a\nfountain which springs out of Nothingness (the Crown) and from which\nthe other sefirot will flow, sometimes as a seed or germ from which\neverything develops, and sometimes as a point. (The idea behind the\nlast image is that just as the movement of a point generates a line,\nand the movement of a line generates a surface, so the\n\u201cmovement\u201d of Wisdom [together with the\n\u201cmovement\u201d of Intelligence] generates the other sefirot.)\nIntelligence is the principle of \u201cindividuation and\ndifferentiation,\u201d and \u201cunfolds\u201d what is \u201cfolded\nup\u201d in wisdom. (If wisdom was the \u201cconfused\u201d or\nundifferentiated thought of creation, Intelligence is that thought\nbecome clear and distinct. [Scholem 1946, 207\u201309, 213\u201320; Epstein,\n236].)\n\n\nThe doctrine of the divine emanations or sefirot might already be\nthought to compromise God\u2019s unity. But matters become still more\nproblematic in an influential treatise that was composed in Provence\naround 1230, and (falsely) ascribed to Hai Goan.\n\n\nAccording to its pseudonymous author, \u201cthree hidden\nlights\u201d are found in the \u201croot of roots\u201d that exists\n\u201cabove the first sefirah\u201d\u2014\u201cthe inner\nprimordial light,\u201d the \u201ctransparent (or: ultra clear)\nlight,\u201d and \u201cthe clear light.\u201d These\n\u201clights\u201d are one thing and one substance that \u201care\nfound without separation and without union, in the most intimate\nrelation with the root of roots,\u201d or (more strongly) are the\nvery \u201cname and substance of the root of all roots.\u201d The\nthree lights are the immediate source of \u201cthe three supreme\nsefirot of \u2018Pure Thought,\u2019 \u2018Knowledge,\u2019 and\n\u2018Intellect,\u2019\u201d but whereas the sefirot\n\u201cthemselves are clearly created [or emanated?] \u2026 the\ntriad of the lights illuminate one another, uncreated [and\nunemanated?], without beginning, in the hidden root.\u201d According\nto the Pseudo-Hai, then, a triad exists in the hidden Godhead\nitself.\n\n\nLater Kabbalists were aware \u201cof a possible connection between\nthese ideas and the Christian Trinity,\u201d but explained the latter\nas a corruption of the former. Jesus and his disciples were themselves\n\u201creal Kabbalists, \u2018only their Kabbalah was full of\nmistakes\u2019\u201d\u2014their doctrine of the Trinity was the\nresult of their misinterpretation of the doctrine of the three lights!\nWhatever one thinks of this, there are striking similarities\nbetween the two doctrines. But there are also important differences.\nThe lights \u201care neither persons nor \u2018hypostases\u2019 in\nGod,\u201d for example, and there is no mention of \u201cspecific\nrelationships\u201d between them (such as begetting and being\nbegotten, or \u201cspiration\u201d and \u201cprocession\u201d) (Scholem\n1987, 349\u201354).\n The suspicion of Christian influence was by no means restricted to\nthe Pseudo-Hai\u2019s doctrine of the three lights, however, for\n\u201cphilosophical opponents of the Kabbalah\u201d had already\nsuggested \u201cthat the doctrine of the ten sefirot was [itself] of\nChristian origin\u201d (Scholem 1987, 354). Nor was this criticism\neasily laid to rest. Thus, Isaac bar Sheshet Parfat (1326\u20131408)\nsays (Gellman 2013, 46) that he had \u201cheard a philosopher speak\nin a defaming manner of the Kabbalists,\u201d saying\n\u201c\u2018The Gentiles [Christians] are believers in a trinity,\nand the kabbalists are believers in a ten-ity\u2019\u201d.\n\n\nThe general problem, of course, was that, on its surface at least, the\ndoctrine of the sefirot seems incompatible with God\u2019s unity. Rabbi\nAzriel of Gerona (d. 1238) addressed this issue in his\n\u201cExplanation of the Ten Sefirot.\u201d In the first place, the\nhigher sefirot, at least, have always existed \u201cin potentia\nin the Eyn Sof before they were actualized\u201d (Azriel,\n93, my emphasis) Moreover, because \u201cthe receptor [the sefirah]\n\u2026 unite[s] with the bestower [ultimately, the En Sof] into one\npower, \u2026 the two are really one.\u201d So the answer to our\ndifficulty is apparently this. The emanation of the sefirot is\ncompatible with God\u2019s unity because (unlike created beings) the\nsefirot are contained within the En Sof itself in a potential or\nundifferentiated form, and because (since their power is the\npower of the En Sof), there is ultimately only one power. Thus,\n\u201cno emanation is radiated forth except to proclaim the unity\nwithin the Eyn Sof\u201d (Azriel, 93\u201395). Or as Rabbi Moshe\nHaim Luzzatto claimed (Gellman 2013, 46) in the first half of the\neighteenth century, \u201cthe sefirot are not separate from the one\nwho emanates, for they are like the flame connected to the coal, and\nall is one, a unity that has within it no division.\u201d Whether\nconsiderations like these fully resolve the problem is a moot\nquestion.\n\n\nStill, the Kabbalah is only one strand within Judaism. By contrast,\nthe doctrine of the Trinity, and of the divinity of both Vishnu and\nLakshmi, are firmly rooted at the very heart of Christianity and Shri\nVaishnavism, respectively. Perhaps as a result, these traditions have\ndevoted much more thought to reconciling monotheism with elements\nwhich, on their face, seem at odds with it.\n",
