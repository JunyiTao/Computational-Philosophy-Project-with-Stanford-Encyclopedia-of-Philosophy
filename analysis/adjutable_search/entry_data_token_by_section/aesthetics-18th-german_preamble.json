    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe philosophical discipline of aesthetics did not receive its name\nuntil 1735, when the twenty-one year old Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten\nintroduced it in his Halle master\u2019s thesis to\nmean epist\u00eam\u00ea aisthetik\u00ea, or the science of\nwhat is sensed and imagined (Baumgarten, Meditationes\n\u00a7CXVI, pp. 86\u20137). But Baumgarten\u2019s denomination of the\nfield was an adult baptism: without a name, aesthetics had been part\nof philosophy since Plato attacked the educational value of poetry in\nthe Republic and Aristotle briefly defended them in his\nfragmentary Poetics. In particular, Aristotle defended poetry\nfrom Plato\u2019s charge that it is cognitively useless, trading in mere\nimages of particulars rather than universal truths, by arguing that\npoetry delivers universal truths in a readily graspable form, unlike,\nfor example, history, which deals merely with particular facts\n(Aristotle, Poetics, chapter 9, 1451a37\u20131451b10). And\nif experience of poetry can reveal important moral truths, then it can\nalso be important to the development of morality, the other pole of\nPlato\u2019s doubts. Some variant of this response to Plato was the core of\naesthetics through much of subsequent philosophical history, and\nindeed continued to be central to aesthetics through much of the\ntwentieth century. In the eighteenth century, however, two alternative\nresponses to Plato were introduced.  One may be regarded as taking up\nAristotle\u2019s idea in the Poetics that \u201ckatharsis,\u201d\npurification or purgation, of the emotions of fear and pity, is a\nvaluable part of our response to a tragedy; this led to an emphasis on\nthe emotional impact of aesthetic experience that was downplayed in\nthe cognitivist tradition. This line of thought was emphasized by\nJean-Baptiste Du Bos in his Critical Reflections on Poetry,\nPainting, and Music, published in France in 1719 and widely known\nthroughout Europe even before it was translated into other languages.\nThe other innovation was the idea that our response to beauty, whether\nin nature or in art, is a free play of our mental powers that is\nintrinsically pleasurable, and thus needs no epistemological or moral\njustification, although it may in fact have epistemological and moral\nbenefits. This line of thought was introduced in Britain in Joseph\nAddison\u2019s 1712 Spectator essays on \u201cThe Pleasures of\nthe Imagination,\u201d and developed by subsequent Scottish writers\nsuch as Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), and Alexander\nGerard. It was only slowly received in Germany, hinted at by Moses\nMendelssohn in the late 1750s, who also took up Du Bos\u2019 emphasis on\nthe emotional impact of aesthetic experience, but then made its first\nsustained appearance in the emphasis on the pleasure of the unhindered\nactivity of our powers of representation in some of the entries in\nJohann Georg Sulzer\u2019s Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen\nK\u00fcnste (1771\u201374), e.g., the entries on\n\u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201ctaste\u201d (Sulzer, Allgemeine\nTheorie, vol.  II, pp. 371\u201385, at p. 371, and\n\u201cSch\u00f6n (Sch\u00f6ne K\u00fcnste),\u201d vol. IV,\npp. 305\u201319, at p. 307). It became central to the aesthetic\ntheories of Kant and Schiller in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790) and the Letters on the Aesthetic Education of\nMankind (1795). This article will chronicle the interaction\nbetween the traditional theory of aesthetic experience as a special\nform of the cognition of truth and the newer theories of aesthetic\nexperience as a free play of cognitive (and sometimes other) mental\npowers and as a vicarious experience of emotions in eighteenth-century\nGermany.\n",
