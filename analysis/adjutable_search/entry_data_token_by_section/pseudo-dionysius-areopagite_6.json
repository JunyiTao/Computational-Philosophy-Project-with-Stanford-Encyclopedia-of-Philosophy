    "main_text": "Outline and Content of the Works || On the Celestial and Ecclesiastical Hierarchies\n3.5 On the Celestial and Ecclesiastical Hierarchies\n\nPerhaps even more vexing than the nature of union in Dionysius is the\nquestion of how the theological treatises relate to Dionysius\u2019\ntwo treatises on hierarchy. The Mystical Theology suggests an\nascent from the lower sensuous realm of reality through the\nintelligible intermediate realm to the darkness of the godhead itself,\nall accomplished by a single person. The hierarchic treatises, on the\nother hand, suggest that the sensible and intelligible realms are not\nplaces reached by a single being, but different kinds of beings, and\nthat the vision of God is handed from being to being downward through\nthe levels of the hierarchy. On the Celestial Hierarchy\ndescribes the intelligible realm as divided into nine ranks of beings:\nthe seraphim, cherubim, thrones, dominions, powers, authorities,\nprincipalities, archangels, and angels. On the Ecclesiastical\nHierarchy describes the human beings within the church as divided\ninto eight ranks: the hierarchs or bishops, priests, deacons, monks,\nlaity, catechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed. Dionysius does\nnot address human life outside the church, except for a few scattered\nreferences to the angels presiding over other religious traditions and\nthe earlier \u201clegal hierarchy\u201d of the Jewish rite, which\nprecedes the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Christian rite.\n\nThe hierarchs, highest within the human hierarchy, contemplate the\nintelligible realm directly, though presumably they contemplate only\nits lowest level: the angels. The visible result of the\nhierarchs\u2019 contemplation of the angels is the series of rites\nbelonging to the Christian church. Since the hierarchs are able to\ncontemplate the intelligible directly, they do not perform the rites\nfor their own sake, but for the sake of the monks and laity, who have\nno capacity for direct intelligible contemplation. The monks and laity\nare able to engage the passionless part of their souls only through\nthe passionate part, and so they require a visible trigger\u2014the\nsymbol\u2014to stimulate their intelligible contemplation. The ranks\nof hierarch, priest, and deacon are in charge of administering the\nrites, with a specific set of initiates in their care and a specific\naction to perform. The deacons purify the catechumens, penitents, and\npossessed, primarily by giving them ethical instruction. The priests\nilluminate the laity, who are able to receive the intelligible truth.\nThe hierarchs perfect, a task whose initiate seems ideally to be the\nmonk, since Dionysius identifies the monks as leading the more perfect\nlife of those who are not explicitly consecrated as clergy.\n\nThe very structure of the church reflects the different roles of the\nclergy and the laity. The hierarch stands still at the altar, facing\naway from the multiplicity of the church\u2019s interior. He enters\nthe nave of the church only to bring sacred objects like incense,\nbread and wine, and holy oil into the realm of multiplicity, the\nspatially extended nave. When he brings the censer into the nave, for\nexample, its fragrance is distributed to the laity there, just as the\nbread and wine are later distributed in the eucharistic rite. The\nhierarch then returns to the altar, and takes up again his own proper\nobject of contemplation, the intelligible source of the rites. The\nlaity, on the other hand, remain within the spatially extended nave,\nbut orient themselves toward the altar, where the sacred objects are\nraised for their contemplation. Before this contemplation can occur,\nthe catechumens, penitents, and the demon-possessed must be removed\nfrom the church. Their orientation toward the material prevents them\nfrom adequately contemplating the intelligible truth through its\nvisible manifestation in the sacred objects.\n\nAlthough the rites have intelligible contemplation as their goal, it\ndoes not appear that non-ritual forms of contemplation, like reading,\ncan substitute for participation in the rites. Dionysian contemplation\nis public, so that it may unite us to each other; it involves prayer,\nso that it may unite us explicitly with the godhead; it also requires\nbodies, since only the interaction of bodies allows the contemplative\nact to include both components of our nature: body and soul. The names\nused in Dionysius\u2019 theological treatises acquire their salvific\npower in this liturgical context. Although the rites involve the\nperformance of bodily actions, they clothe themselves in words: the\nHebrew and Christian scriptures, and the oral tradition of the\nliturgical prayers. Only the silence and unknowing of the Mystical\nTheology finds no clear place within the liturgical rites of the\nhierarchy, since it transcends both the visible rites of the laity and\nthe intelligible contemplation of the clergy. It may be that, just as\nsome points of the liturgy call for a literal silence, the\nintelligible contemplation of the hierarch at the altar must engage in\nits own form of silence, so as to allow the appearance of the godhead\nbeyond naming. On this question, however, Dionysius is as silent as\nthe mystical theology which crowns his vision of the human ascent to\nGod.\n",
