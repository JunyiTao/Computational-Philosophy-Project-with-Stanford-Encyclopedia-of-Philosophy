    "main_text": "The Development of Conservative Thought || Precursors of Burkean conservatism\n2.2 Precursors of Burkean conservatism\n\nDavid Hume (1711\u201376) is sometimes regarded as a precursor of\nBurke\u2019s conservatism. For Neiman,\n\n\nBurke used [Hume\u2019s] claims about the impotence of reason and the\nmind\u2019s subsequent dependence on custom and habit to argue\nagainst radical attempts to change the established order. (Neiman\n2001: 294)\n\n\nCobban contrasts Burke\u2019s residual contractualism with\nHume\u2019s\n\n\ntheory of the origins of society and government which placed political\nconservatism on a much sounder and more realistic basis. (1960:\n51)\n\n\nOthers claim Hume as a proto-liberal. John Stewart rejects the picture\nof Hume clinging to a raft of custom and artifice, because as a\nsceptic, he has no alternative: \u201c[He] was confident that by\nexperience and reflection philosophers can achieve true\nprinciples\u201d, and did not deny that reason determines right and\nwrong in morals and politics (Stewart 2014: 8).\n",
