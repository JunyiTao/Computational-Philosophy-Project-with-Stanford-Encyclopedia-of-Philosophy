His thought in this regard has\nseveral features that make it unique including: his integration of\nYog\u0101c\u0101ra thought, his integration of Buddhist\nlogico-epistemological (pram\u0101\u1e47a) developments\n(discussed below), and his dynamic engagement with other Buddhist and\nnon-Buddhist views (discussed below). His Madhyamaka view is most\nclearly and succinctly articulated in his text\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101ra (The Ornament of the\nMiddle Way, hereafter, MA) and his own commentary on that text,\nMadhyamak\u0101la\u1e43k\u0101rav\u1e5btti (The\nAuto-Commentary on The Ornament of the Middle Way, hereafter,\n MAV).[5]\n",
