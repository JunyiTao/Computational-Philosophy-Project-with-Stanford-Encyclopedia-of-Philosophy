    "main_text": "\n\nIt is common today to take the concept religion as a taxon\nfor sets of social practices, a category-concept whose paradigmatic\nexamples are the so-called \u201cworld\u201d religions of Judaism,\nChristianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and\n Daoism.[1]\n Perhaps equally paradigmatic, though somewhat trickier to label, are\nforms of life that have not been given a name, either by practitioners\nor by observers, but are common to a geographical area or a group of\npeople\u2014for example, the religion of China or that of ancient\nRome, the religion of the Yoruba or that of the Cherokee. In short,\nthe concept is today used for a genus of social formations that\nincludes several members, a type of which there are many tokens.\n\nThe concept religion did not originally refer to a social\ngenus, however. Its earliest references were not to social kinds and,\nover time, the extension of the concept has evolved in different\ndirections, to the point that it threatens incoherence. As Paul\nGriffiths notes, listening to the discussions about the concept\nreligion\n\n\nrapidly suggests the conclusion that hardly anyone has any idea what\nthey are talking about\u2014or, perhaps more accurately, that there\nare so many different ideas in play about what religion is that\nconversations in which the term figures significantly make the\ndifficulties in communication at the Tower of Babel seem minor and\neasily dealt with. These difficulties are apparent, too, in the\nacademic study of religion, and they go far toward an explanation of\nwhy the discipline has no coherent or widely shared understanding of\nits central topic. (2000: 30)\n\n\nThis entry therefore provides a brief history of the how the semantic\nrange of religion has grown and shifted over the years, and\nthen considers two philosophical issues that arise for the contested\nconcept, issues that are likely to arise for other abstract concepts\nused to sort cultural types (such as \u201cliterature\u201d,\n\u201cdemocracy\u201d, or \u201cculture\u201d itself). First, the\ndisparate variety of practices now said to fall within this category\nraises a question of whether one can understand this social taxon in\nterms of necessary and sufficient properties or whether instead one\nshould instead treat it as a family resemblance concept. Here, the\nquestion is whether the concept religion can be said to have\nan essence. Second, the recognition that the concept has shifted its\nmeanings, that it arose at a particular time and place but was unknown\nelsewhere, and that it has so often been used to denigrate certain\ncultures, raises the question whether the concept corresponds to any\nkind of entity in the world at all or whether, instead, it is simply a\nrhetorical device that should be retired. This entry therefore\nconsiders the rise of critical and skeptical analyses of the concept,\nincluding those that argue that the term refers to nothing.\n",
