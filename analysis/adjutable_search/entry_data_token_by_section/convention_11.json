    "main_text": "Critical reactions to Lewis || Must convention solve a coordination problem?\n4.4 Must convention solve a coordination problem?\n\n\nWayne Davis (2003), Andrei Marmor (1996, 2009), Seumas Miller (2001), Robert\nSugden (1986/2004), and Peter Vanderschraaf (1998) argue that\nconventions need not be coordination equilibria. For instance, Davis\nclaims that fashion conventions do not solve coordination problems,\nsince we do not usually care how other people dress.\n\n\nTo develop this objection, Sugden introduces conventions of\nproperty and conventions of reciprocity, neither of which\nsolves coordination problems. He illustrates the former with the\nHawk-Dove game (also sometimes called \u201cChicken\u201d):\n\n\n\n\nDove\nHawk\n\n\nDove\n1, 1\n0, 2\n\n\nHawk\n2, 0\n\\(\\bfrac{1}{2},\\)\u00a0\\(\\bfrac{1}{2}\\)\n\n\nHawk-Dove Payoff Matrix\n\n\n\nThe intuitive interpretation here is that two people faced with an\nitem of value 2 must decide whether to fight for it (Hawk) or share it\n(Dove). If both play Dove, then they split it. If one plays Hawk and\nthe other Dove, then the Hawk gets the entire good. If they both play\nHawk, then they again split it, but its value is reduced by half to\nreflect the cost of fighting. This game has no coordination\nequilibrium. However, consider the following strategy for recurring\ninstances of the game: \u201cIf you are already in possession of the\nrelevant item, then play Hawk; otherwise, play\nDove.\u201d It is an equilibrium for both players to play\nthis strategy. (More technically, following Skyrms (1996), we might\nregard this strategy combination as a correlated equilibrium.) Sugden\nargues that such an equilibrium might emerge as a convention among\nagents who repeatedly play Hawk-Dove. But the equilibrium is not a\nconvention according to Lewis\u2019s definition. If I play my end of\nit, I do not prefer that other people do likewise. I prefer that others\nplay Dove. Thus, the equilibrium lacks one of the main characteristics\nemphasized by Lewis: a preference for general conformity over\nslight-less-than-general conformity.\n\n\nSugden illustrates conventions of reciprocity with the Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma, which has the following payoff matrix:\n\n\n\n\nCooperate\nDefect\n\n\nCooperate\n2, 2\n0, 3\n\n\nDefect\n3, 0\n0, 0\n\n\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma Payoff Matrix\n\n\n\nThe original intuitive interpretation of this payoff matrix is that\nthe police are separately interrogating two prisoners, each of whom\nmust decide whether to cooperate with the other prisoner by remaining\nsilent or whether to \u201cdefect\u201d by confessing. If both\ncooperate, then both receive very light sentences. If both defect, then\nboth receive very harsh sentences. If one defects and the other\ncooperates, then the defector goes free while the cooperator receives a\nharsh sentence. Although this scenario may seem rather contrived, we\ncan model many common social interactions as instances of\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma. Sugden offers as an example two academics who\nexchange houses for their sabbaticals. Each academic must decide\nwhether to maintain the other\u2019s house in good condition, even\nthough leaving it a mess would be easier.\n\n\nPrisoner\u2019s Dilemma has no coordination equilibrium. Yet Sugden\nargues that the following \u201ctit-for-tat\u201d strategy might\nemerge as a convention when players repeatedly play Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma over some indefinite period (e.g., two academics with a\nstanding arrangement to exchange houses every summer): co-operate as\nlong as your opponent cooperates; if your opponent defects, then defect\nfor some prescribed number of rounds \\(r\\) as retaliation before\ncooperating again; if your opponent cooperates but you defect by\nmistake, then accept your opponent\u2019s punishment in the next\n\\(r\\) rounds without retaliating. This equilibrium is not a\nconvention in Lewis\u2019s sense, since one always prefers that\none\u2019s opponent cooperate rather than defect.\n\n\nIn response to such examples, Sugden (1986/2004) and Vanderschraaf\n(1998b) develop generalized game-theoretic analyses that do not require\nconvention to solve a coordination problem. In practice, the necessary\nrevisions to Lewis\u2019s account are not very sweeping, since they\nbasically amount to excising clause (4) from his conceptual analysis.\nVanderschraaf (1998a) argues that these revisions yield a theory closer\nto Hume\u2019s original account.\n\n\nMarmor (2009) also questions Lewis\u2019s focus on coordination\nproblems. Marmor emphasizes actual games, such as chess, rather than\nthe \u201cgames\u201d primarily studied by game theorists, such as Prisoner\u2019s\nDilemma. According to Marmor, the rules of chess are conventions that\ndo not solve a coordination problem. Chess playing activity does not\ninvolve coordinating one\u2019s actions with those of other players, in\nanything like the sense that driving on the right side of the road\n(rather than the left) involves coordination among agents. Drawing on\nJohn Searle\u2019s (1969) discussion of \u201cconstitutive rules,\u201d Marmor argues\nthat Lewis has overlooked an important class of conventions, which\nMarmor calls \u201cconstitutive conventions,\u201d modeled after the rules of a\ngame. Roughly, a constitutive convention helps \u201cconstitute\u201d a social\npractice, in the sense that it helps define what the practice is and\nhow to engage in it correctly. Marmor offers a generalized analysis\ndesigned to accommodate both Lewisian conventions and constitutive\nconventions. The analysis resembles Lewis\u2019s, but it makes no mention\nof coordination problems, and it contains no reference to common\nknowledge.\n",
