    "main_text": "Contents as Accuracy Conditions\n2. Contents as Accuracy Conditions\n\nWhen one speaks of the contents of a bucket, one is talking about what\nis spatially inside the bucket. An analogous use of \u201cthe\ncontents of perception\u201d would pick out what is \u2018in the\nmind\u2019 when one has a perceptual experience. In contrast, when\none speaks of the contents of a newspaper, one is talking about what\ninformation the newspaper stories convey. Many contemporary uses of\n\u201cthe contents of perception\u201d take such contents to be\nanalogous to the contents of a newspaper story, rather than the\ncontents of a bucket. This notion of content can straightforwardly\naccommodate the idea that there is such a thing as the\n\u2018testimony of the senses\u2019.\n\nOne influential version of the idea that the contents of perception\nare analogous to the contents of a newspaper story holds that the\ncontents of an experience are given by the conditions under which it\nis accurate. What an experience conveys to the subject, according to\nthis conception, is that those conditions are satisfied.\n\nOn the conception of contents as given by accuracy conditions, there\nis a broad analogy between the contents of experience and the contents\nof thoughts and utterances, in that both contents are assessable for\naccuracy. Suppose I utter the sentence \u201cDogs are lively, loyal\ncreatures\u201d and thereby express my belief that dogs are lively,\nloyal creatures. The content of my utterance is what I assert, and the\ncontent of my belief is what I believe\u2014in both cases, that dogs\nare lively, loyal creatures. Usually these contents are thought of as\nsome kind of proposition\u2014an abstract object that is the kind of\nthing that can be true or false (see the entry on\n structured propositions).\n Notice that both the utterance and the belief are assessable for\ntruth: their content is true just in case dogs really are lively,\nloyal creatures.\n\nIn the case of beliefs and utterances, it is not just their contents\nthat are assessable for accuracy (where accuracy is truth); the\nbeliefs and utterances themselves are as well. A belief or utterance\ninherits its truth-value from the truth-value of its content. This\nstands in contrast to desires or hopes, which may have contents that\nare assessable for accuracy, but are not themselves so assessable. If\nexperiences have accuracy conditions, then they are like beliefs and\nutterances in this respect, and unlike desires and hopes.\n\nThe conception of the contents of experience as given by its accuracy\ncondition can be motivated by the idea that one can be misled by\none\u2019s experiences. Suppose you see a fish while unwittingly\nlooking in a mirror. It may look as if there is a red fish in front of\nyou, when in fact the red fish you see is behind you and there is no\nfish at all in front of you. Similarly, in auditory or olfactory\nhallucinations, one may seem to hear voices when in fact no one is\nspeaking, or to smell an odor when in fact nothing is emitting that\nsmell. In phantom limb pain, one feels pain as located where\none\u2019s limb used to be but is no longer. These are cases of being\nmisled by one\u2019s senses, and it is natural to say that in these\ncases things are not as they appear to be.\n\nOnce one recognizes the datum that one can be misled by one\u2019s\nsenses, it is a further claim that experiences themselves can be\nassessed for accuracy. It is a further claim, because one might be\nmisled by something that is not itself assessable for accuracy: e.g.,\none might be misled by the car in the driveway into thinking that your\nneighbor is home. So the fact that something plays the role of\nmisleading you does not show that it is assessable for accuracy. But\nin the case of experiences, this further claim is motivated in the\nfollowing way. Given an experience\u2014either one we actually have,\nor a hypothetical one\u2014we at least sometimes have intuitions\nabout whether the experience is accurate (\u201cveridical\u201d) or\ninaccurate (\u201cfalsidical\u201d). To this extent, we seem to be\nable to assess experiences for accuracy.\n\nWhen we assess an experience as accurate or inaccurate, we consider\nhow things are in the world. This suggests that experiences which can\nbe assessed for accuracy are associated with accuracy\nconditions: conditions under which the experience is\naccurate. When we have intuitions about whether an experience is\naccurate, we at least sometimes also have intuitions about the\nconditions under which it would be accurate. (For discussion of such\nintuitions, see Siewert (1998), chapter 7, Schellenberg (2018). Going\nwith this, we seem to have intuitions about when experiences are\nincorrect.\n\nIn large part, our intuitions about when experiences are accurate\nconcern objects and properties. For instance, many have the intuition\nthat the following experience is falsidical: you see a fish that\nappears blue to you, but is actually red. According to the intuition,\nthe fish\u2019s failing to be blue suffices for the experience to be\nfalsidical. Intuitively, for the experience to be accurate, the fish\nin question must really be blue. It is an open question how specific\nand how extensive such intuitions are, hence to what extent such\nintuitions can reveal which accuracy conditions experiences have,\nassuming that they have accuracy conditions at all. But so long as\nthere are some such intuitions, there is a prima facie case for\nexperiences having accuracy conditions.\n",
