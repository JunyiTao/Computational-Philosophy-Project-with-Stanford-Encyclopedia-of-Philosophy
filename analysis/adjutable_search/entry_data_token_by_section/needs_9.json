Needs in Recent Theories of Distributive Justice\n\n\nGiven the prominent role that needs appear to play in popular\nconceptions of social justice, it may seem remarkable that they have\nbeen largely sidelined in the theories of distributive justice\ndeveloped by philosophers over the last half century, as this section\nwill demonstrate. It is perhaps not a surprise that libertarian\ntheorists such as Robert Nozick should deny that justice might require\nredistribution on behalf of those in need (Nozick 1974, ch. 8; for a\ncritique see Brock 1995). On such a view, while it might be charitable\nor benevolent to help a person in need, justice is defined in terms of\nthe obligation to respect an individual\u2019s personal and property\nrights, and so need only becomes relevant when a person\u2019s needy\ncondition is the result of a prior rights-violation (say, because they\nhave been robbed of their means of subsistence).\n\n\nMost liberal philosophers, however, rather than explicitly rejecting\nclaims of need, have chosen instead to subsume them within some\nbroader theory of justice, thereby denying them any special force.\nConsider, for example, utilitarian philosophers who advocate using\noverall welfare, understood either as happiness or as desire\nsatisfaction, as the goal by which proposed policies should be\nevaluated. Needs will feature indirectly in this picture: an\nunfulfilled need is likely to be a source of pain or frustration, a\nfulfilled need a source of satisfaction. But there is no reason of\nprinciple to discriminate between, for example, a need and a strong\ndesire. As we saw in section 2.2.1, Griffin (1986) uses the example of\nscholars preferring to build a library extension in place of a gym to\nillustrate the error in supposing that needs should always trump\nwell-informed wants. From a welfarist perspective, there is nothing\nspecial about meeting claims of need.\n\n\nJohn Rawls\u2019s theory of justice is often presented as a\ncorrective to the deficiencies of utilitarianism. But like his\nutilitarian rivals, Rawls pays no specific attention to needs. In the\nfirst full presentation of his theory, what Rawls refers to as\n\u2018the precept of need\u2019 is given one paragraph in a book of\n600 pages (Rawls 1971, 276\u201377). The reason for this neglect\nis fairly clear. According to Rawls, social justice concerns the\ndistribution of \u2018primary goods\u2019\u2014listed as\n\u2018rights and liberties, opportunities and powers, income and\nwealth\u2019\u2014and he assesses that distribution by looking at\nhow representative individuals occupying different social positions,\nlike unskilled worker, fare. So the need claims of particular\nindividuals, such as those with disabilities or special health care\nrequirements, never enter the picture (see further Sen 1980).  Rawls\nspeaks of needs only when discussing the transfer branch of\ngovernment, which is supposed to correct the market distribution of\nincome and wealth by giving resources to those who are worst off\neconomically. In other words, need-based claims for income are\nsubsumed under the general principle of controlling inequalities so as\nto maximise the living standard of the least advantaged\ngroup\u2014the so-called \u2018difference principle\u2019 (Rawls\n1971, \u00a7 12\u201313). Rawls mentions in passing a different kind\nof justice that concerns the allocation of goods to particular\npersons, but at this stage he simply excludes it from his theory as a\npotentially misleading distraction (Rawls 1971, 88\u201389).\n\n\nIn his later presentation of the theory (Rawls 2001), Rawls tried to\nrespond to the charge that he had overlooked one important dimension\nof social justice by failing to notice how citizens who had the same\nshare of primary goods might nonetheless have very different\nindividual needs (for this criticism, see especially Sen 1980, 1992,\nch. 5). He did so by arguing that access to medical care,\nspecifically, should be regarded as one component of the basic bundle\nof goods whose size the difference principle aimed to maximise (Rawls\n2001, \u00a7 51).  Each citizen could anticipate that over the course\nof her lifetime she could expect to require some medical treatment,\nand so access to health care should be factored into the calculation\nof her life prospects. Rawls did not, however, have anything more\nspecific to say about justice in health care\u2014for instance about\nwho among the needy had the strongest claims to be treated\u2014nor\nabout needs of other kinds, nor about the position of people with\nserious disabilities who could not aspire to be \u2018fully\nco-operating members of society\u2019. Thus arguably the most\ninfluential theory of social justice to have appeared in the last\nhalf-century virtually eliminated need as an independent criterion of\ndistribution.\n\n\nConsider next Ronald Dworkin\u2019s \u2018equality of\nresources\u2019 view (Dworkin 1981). This might appear to give more\nscope to needs than Rawls\u2019s theory by virtue of the fact that it\nregards personal capacities and incapacities as among the resources\nthat a theory of justice must take into account. Thus insofar as need\ncan be represented as an internal resource deficiency, we might expect\nDworkin to count it as a feature that may entitle its bearer to\nreceive additional resources by way of compensation. And he does\nindeed devote some attention both to the issue of people with\nhandicaps and to the issue of health care in Dworkin 2000 (especially\nchs 2 and 8). He tackles this problem through the device of\nhypothetical insurance: to illustrate this in the case of medical\nneeds, in order to decide what provision a state should make for\nhealth care\u2014how much it should spend and what priorities it\nshould adopt when resources are scarce\u2014we should ask what health\ncare insurance people would buy in advance if they did not know what\ntheir own medical needs would turn out to be. Since this is likely to\nvary from one person to the next, depending on how averse they are to\nparticular risks, Dworkin has to stipulate that what justice requires\nthe state to provide is the level of coverage that most people would\nchoose to buy under these conditions. In reaching a decision, people\nwould be expected to trade off buying different levels of insurance\nagainst other ways of using their money. So again this is a case in\nwhich need considerations get subsumed under a wider principle, in\nthis case compensating people for disadvantages which they would have\ninsured against suffering in advance. Need claims aren\u2019t allowed\nto have independent force. Dworkin\u2019s answer to the question\n\u2018is satisfying this particular need a matter of justice?\u2019\nis \u2018it depends on whether people generally would have chosen to\npurchase insurance against the chance of having it\u2019. The same\nprinciple is applied to other misfortunes, such as the chance of\nbecoming unemployed.\n\n\nFinally here, consider so-called luck egalitarian theories of\ndistributive justice (see, for example, Temkin 1993; Knight 2009;\nCohen 2011, Part 1; Knight and Stemplowska 2011; Tan 2012). These hold\nthat no-one should be worse off than anyone else unless they are\nresponsible for being worse-off, for example by developing expensive\ntastes or gambling away their resources. Conversely, inequalities that\ncan be attributed to brute luck\u2014such as a storm that demolishes\nmy house but not yours\u2014should be compensated for by\nredistribution from the lucky to the unlucky. At first sight, it looks\nas though this principle will be sensitive to variations in need:\nbeing prone to disease or requiring more calories than average to stay\nhealthy look like exactly the kind of involuntary misfortunes that\nluck egalitarians will seek to rectify via resource transfers. But\nnotice that special needs of this sort are treated no differently from\nother sources of disadvantage, like having meagre talents or being\nborn into a poor family. Luck egalitarians use an undiscriminating,\nand often ill-defined, currency of advantage/disadvantage that can\nrespond to the fact that some people are needier than others, but\nwithout giving those differences any special weight. Notice also that\na luck egalitarian will distinguish between needs that a person has as\na result of her innate bodily features or of accidents that befall\nher, and needs that she has as a result of lifestyle or other choices\nfor which she is personally responsible, and will mandate that she be\ncompensated only for having special needs in the first category. This\nhas led critics such as Anderson (1999) to accuse the doctrine of\nharshness for abandoning negligent victims and discriminating among\nthe disabled according to the source of their disability. For luck\negalitarians, justice doesn\u2019t require that we should respond to\npeople\u2019s needs regardless of how they have arisen.\n",
