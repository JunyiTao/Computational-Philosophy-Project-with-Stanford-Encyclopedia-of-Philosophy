    "main_text": "The Question of Causes: Capitalism or Culture || Racist Constructions of Women of Color\n4.4 Racist Constructions of Women of Color\n\nCritical race feminist philosophers have developed a critical\nanalysis of the ways in which categories such as \u201cBlack\nwomen\u201d as well as \u201cwomen of the global south\u201d have\nbeen constituted as an academic object of study and analysis (Narayan\n1997; Khader 2011, 2018; duCille 1997). Uma Narayan argued that\nrepresentations of women in India reproduce naturalistic frames and\nglobal hierarchies that devised a version of the culture of poverty\nthesis on an international scale. Notably, violence against women in\nthe global north is not generally given cultural explanations but\nportrayed as a problem of individual pathology or an undifferentiated\nmisogyny that operates outside of specific histories and contexts. By\ncontrast, women of the global south are portrayed as oppressed by their\ncultures and religions.\n\nSerene Khader expands on this analysis to show how culturalist\nexplanations result in underestimating the agency of women in the\nglobal south, creating the view that their agency is only possible when\nthey completely reject their religion or culture. This is a problem not\nonly in the social sciences but also in postmodern feminist theory, and\nit occludes possibilities of universalist feminism because the\noppressed Third World woman constructed in this way requires uplift,\nnot dialogic engagements in which there might develop a larger\nunderstanding of the complex nature of sexism as well as the multiple\npossibilities of liberation from sexism. In some writings, the Third\nWorld woman is reified to such a degree that no serious political\nengagement about how to formulate shared feminist aims is possible.\n\nKhader develops an approach to adaptive preferences that allows for\nnon-ideal and historically attuned assessments of choices in any given\ncontext. All gendered individuals in reality make choices within\nstructured environments. Outsiders to these environments tend to\nmisdiagnose women\u2019s choices, viewing them as accepting of\noppression when in truth they may be efforts at self-protection.\nMistaken analyses can also occur when cultures are reified as static;\nif we drop this idea Khader suggests we can judge choices based on\ntheir potential for transitions. For example, covering can enable women\nto venture out of the home without risk, and lead to changed public\nspheres. She argues for an approach that attends to contextual\nconditions of all sorts \u2013 material and cultural \u2013 for\nunderstanding oppression and gauging effective resistance.\nContextualization will yield pluralist rather than uniform notions of\nliberation from gender-based oppression, and Western feminists need to\nbe open to a multiplicity of liberatory forms even including certain\nkinds of gender-based divisions of labor.\n\nAnn duCille takes a critical look at how the category \u201cBlack\nwomen\u201d has been constructed within postmodernism, as well as\nother radical theoretical platforms. It is problematic to take Black\nwomen as the quintessential Other or the paradigm of difference\n(duCille 1997; Davidson 2010). Black women can be\nepistemically privileged in a way that does not reify their otherness,\nconcealing its contextualization and internal variability. Maria del\nGuadalupe Davidson takes up duCille\u2019s challenge to rethink the\ncategory by drawing from Gilles Deleuze\u2019s concept of \u201cthe\nfold\u201d as an alternative approach to identity and subjectivity.\nThis presents an approach to subjectivity as constitutively relational.\nIf theorists will focus on activity and relationality, rather than\nbeing, we may be able to specify unique conditions of Black women\nwithout reification (Davidson, 2010, 128\u2013130).\n\nDebates continue about how to formulate racial identities as well as\nwhether identity-based movements have overshadowed class-based\nmovements. Shohat and Stam explain that the focus on identity should be\nseen against the backdrop of a larger project of global decolonization,\nrather than assumed to be forever complicit with neo-liberalism (2016).\nThe point is not to replace the frame of class struggle, but to\ncomplicate it, bringing ongoing forms of cultural imperialism to the\ncenter of analysis, so that we can begin to discern the\n\u201cmultiaxial forms of resistance and struggle\u201d that face\ndown \u201cmultiaxial forms of oppression\u2026shaping new social\nactors, new vocabularies, and new strategies.\u201d (2016, 421)\n",
