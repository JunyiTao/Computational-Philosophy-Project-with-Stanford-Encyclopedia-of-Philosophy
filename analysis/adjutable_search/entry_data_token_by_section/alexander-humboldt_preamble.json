    "main_text": "\n\nAlexander (Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander) von Humboldt\n(1769\u20131859) was a scientific explorer and natural philosopher,\nwho achieved fame following his return from South America in 1804.\nAlready during his lifetime, biographies celebrating Humboldt began to\nappear (Rupke 2008), and upon his death in 1859, Humboldt was\ncommemorated across the world\u2014from Alexandria to New York City,\nfrom Paris and Moscow to Adelaide and Melbourne (Wulf 2015). An ocean\ncurrent was named after him, as were numerous national parks, regions,\nand a penguin species. He has been described as the first ecologist\n(Bertaux 1985), the \u201cfather of American\nenvironmentalism\u201d (Sachs 2004), the inspiration behind the\nNational Parks Movement in the United States and Great Britain, and a\nmajor influence on environmentalism in India (Grove 1990). \n\nThe younger brother of the linguist, Wilhelm von Humboldt, Alexander\nwas personally acquainted with some of the leading thinkers of his\ntime, including Goethe, Schiller, and Schelling. His distinctive\nsynthesizing approach to knowledge, which has been described as\n\u201cHumboldtian Science\u201d (Cannon 1978), and his view that\nartistic insights and practices support and facilitate empirical\nresearch, can be seen as a realization of what Friedrich Schlegel\ncalled the \u201cromantic imperative\u201d to unite science and art.\nHumboldt influenced a generation of researchers after him, including\nCharles Darwin (Richards 2002), as well as artists, writers,\nphilosophers, and activists (Bunkse 1981; Sachs 2004; Walls 2009).\nThough Humboldt\u2019s fame waned in the twentieth century, in the\nlast two decades he has once again become a household name\u2014first\nthrough Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s comedic novel, Die Vermessung der\nWelt (2004), and more recently through Andrea Wulf\u2019s\nThe Invention of Nature (2015).\n\nWhile Kehlmann situates Humboldt squarely within the Enlightenment\ntradition\u2014the book\u2019s title, \u201cmeasuring the\nworld\u201d, makes jest of Humboldt\u2019s desire to measure\neverything with the most sophisticated instruments\u2014the majority\nof scholars regard Humboldt\u2019s legacy as lying between\nEnlightenment and romanticism (Nicholson 1990, Dettelbach 2001; Reill\n2002; Steigerwald 2000; Tang 2008; Ette 2009; Mill\u00e1n 2011).\nHumboldt\u2019s emphasis on careful measurements and detailed\nobservations was always wedded to an aesthetic approach to\nnature\u2014an approach that regards feeling as integral to\nunderstanding, and art as furnishing crucial tools for expanding\nempirical knowledge. For this reason, Humboldt criticized the\nfragmentation of knowledge, and argued that the history of science\ncannot be divorced from the history of art. Furthermore, and in\ncontrast to the increasingly strong foothold of the ideal of\nobjectivity in science, Humboldt highlighted both the situatedness and\nresponsibility of the knowing subject. \n\nHumboldt\u2019s view that science and art should not be separated\ngoes hand in hand with his understanding of nature and culture as\ndeeply intertwined. To conceive of them as distinct entities, he\nargued, was not only false, but also dangerous. In his research in\nSouth America, Humboldt witnessed first-hand the devastating\nconsequences of colonial practices on both land and people, and\nconcluded that the destruction of nature will lead to the destruction\nof culture, and in particular Indigenous cultures. His critique of\nimperialism, and the ways in which colonial powers thoughtlessly\ndestroyed the homes of the Indigenous peoples, was not disconnected\nfrom his critique of slavery, the institution that he described as\n\u201cthe greatest of all evils that afflict humanity\u201d\n(L\u2019ile de Cuba 1: 309; DA 3: 156; PN 7: 263). \n",
