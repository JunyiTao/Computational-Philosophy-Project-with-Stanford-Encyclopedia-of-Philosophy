    "main_text": "Philosophy of language || The object of words\n3.2 The theory of definition\n\nA significant contribution of Tibetan epistemology which can be\nincluded within the philosophy of language is the discussion of\ndefinition and the related issue of predication. The specificity of\nthe Tibetan theory of definition is that it takes into account not two\nelements\u2014a definiens and a definiendum\u2014but three\nelements\u2014the definiens, the definiendum, and the definitional\nbasis\u2014along a model which bears many similarities with that of\ninference. \u201cDefining\u201d thus relies on the relation between\nthe definiens and the definiendum, but actually consists in the\nestablishment that some definiendum is fit to be applied to some\ndefinitional basis on account of the relevant definiens; for instance,\nthat \u201cJohn is fit to be called \u2018man\u2019 because he is a\nrational animal,\u201d or to take a more indigenous example, that\n\u201cthe white calf is fit to be called \u2018cow\u2019 because it\nhas a hump and a dewlap.\u201d\n\nDiscussions on definition focus on the identification of the instances\nof each of the three elements (what can be a definiens, a definiendum,\nor a definitional basis) and on their respective definition, leading\nin particular to the question whether a definiens requires a\ndefiniens. Another issue is that of the nature of the distinction\nbetween the three elements.\n\nThe evaluation of a definition relies on three criteria that a correct\ndefiniens must fulfill: (i) the definiens applies to the definitional\nbasis, (ii) the definiens can be understood without relying on an\nextrinsic motive, and (iii) the definiens has the same connotation and\ndenotation as the definiendum.\n\nThe second requirement underlines a difference between the definiens\nand the definiendum, expressed in Tibetan in terms of the first being\n\u201csubstantially existent,\u201d the second \u201cnominally\nexistent.\u201d The latter thus depends on the understanding of\nsomething else\u2014here the definiens. According to the third\nrequirement, definiens and definiendum must be co-extensive, but only\na single definiens provides the specific denotation of the\ndefiniendum. For instance, \u201ccausally efficient\u201d is not the\ndefiniens of \u201cimpermanent\u201d even though everything that is\ncausally efficient is impermanent and vice-versa, because it is not\nheld to be directly contradictory to \u201cpermanent,\u201d the way\n\u201cnot remaining for a second moment\u201d (the accepted\ndefiniens of \u201cimpermanent\u201d) is.\n",
