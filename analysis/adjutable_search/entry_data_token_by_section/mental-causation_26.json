    "main_text": "Problem IV: Externalism || Broad Behavior\n7.4 Broad Behavior\n\nDretske\u2019s proposal is a version of the dual explanandum strategy\n(\u00a76.3). The idea is that physical and mental properties are\ncausally responsible for different effects. For Dretske, the\n(triggering) physical properties are responsible for bodily motions,\nwhile the (structuring) mental properties are responsible for\nbehavior.\n\nAnother version of this strategy begins with a point also made in\n\u00a76.3, namely that to question a property\u2019s causal relevance\nis really to question its relevance to some property of the effect.\nThe form of our central causal question, that is, is whether a mental\ncause qua F causes a behavioral effect qua\nG. Now when F is an intentional mental property,\nwhat G is the object of our question? One possibility is that\nit is a behavioral property that, like the mental property, is itself\n\u201cbroad\u201d (see, e.g., Enc 1995).\n\nConsider a simple example: Suppose Lilian believes that a glass in\nfront of her contains water, and this belief (together with her\ndesires) causes her to reach for the glass. Her behavior is an\ninstance of trying to get water, and it\u2019s the\ninstantiation of this property (and not, say, the property of being a\ncertain kind of bodily motion) that we\u2019re wondering about when\nwe ask whether the intentional property of her belief is causally\nrelevant. (If our interest lay solely in explaining a particular\nbodily motion, we would rest content with a non-psychological, purely\nphysiological explanation.) But now the answer seems straightforward.\nFor what makes Lilian\u2019s behavior a trying for water is that\nit\u2019s caused by a belief whose content concerns water. Once we\nrealize that the behavioral property of the effect is itself broad,\nits connection to the intentional mental property seems clear.\n\nThis is not to say that the physical properties of Lilian\u2019s\nbelief do no work: it\u2019s just that they are responsible for a\ndifferent property of the effect, for instance, the property of being\na forward arm-movement. The intentional properties of her belief are\nrelevant to the effect qua (broad) behavior; the physical\nproperties are relevant to the effect qua (narrow) bodily\nmotion. And as we noted earlier (\u00a76.3), such a solution can be\nemployed in response to the Exclusion Problem as well. If a mental\nproperty and its physical realizer are relevant to different\nproperties of the effect, they need not compete causally.\n\nBecause it promises to solve two outstanding problems of mental\ncausation, this approach is potentially quite powerful. (For\ndiscussion, see Fodor 1991; Burge 1995.) One question to raise here,\nhowever, is whether the fact that some behavior can be described\nbroadly makes the intentional mental property of its cause relevant.\nThe undeniable conceptual connections between mental and behavioral\ndescriptions might point to a kind of explanatory relevance,\nbut it\u2019s a further question whether causal connections grounding\nthese explanations involve broad properties. Those motivated by the\noriginal epiphenomenalist arguments will worry that narrow, physical\nproperties are really doing all the work here: the apparent relevance\nof the broad properties is an illusion created by the way we, in\ndescribing and explaining behavior, conceptualize both cause and\neffect (see Owens 1993). This point leads to a fourth, related\nresponse to the problem.\n",
