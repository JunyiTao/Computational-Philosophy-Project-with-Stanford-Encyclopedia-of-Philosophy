Naturally, argumentation\ncan unfold orally in face-to-face encounters\u2014discussions in\nparliament, political debates, in a court of law\u2014as well as in\nwriting\u2014in scientific articles, on the Internet, in newspaper\neditorials. Moreover, it can happen synchronically, with real-time\nexchanges of reasons, or asynchronically. While it is reasonable to\nexpect that there will be some commonalities across these different\nmedia and environments, it is also plausible that specific features of\ndifferent environments may significantly influence how argumentation\nis conducted: different environments present different kinds of\naffordances for arguers (Halpern & Gibbs 2013; Weger\n& Aakhus 2003; see entry on\n embodied cognition\n for the concept of affordance). Indeed, if the Internet represents a\nfundamentally novel cognitive ecology (Smart, Heersmink, & Clowes\n2017), then it will likely give rise to different forms of\nargumentative engagement (Lewi\u0144ski 2010). Whether these new forms\nwill represent progress (according to some suitable metric)\nis however a moot point.\n\nIn the early days of the Internet in the 1990s, there was much hope\nthat online spaces would finally realize the Habermasian ideal of a\npublic sphere for political deliberation (Hindman 2009). The Internet\nwas supposed to act as the great equalizer in the worldwide\nmarketplace of ideas, finally attaining the Millian ideal of free\nexchange of ideas (Mill 1859). Online, everyone\u2019s voice would\nhave an equal chance of being heard, everyone could contribute to the\nconversation, and everyone could simultaneously be a journalist, news\nconsumer, engaged citizen, advocate, and activist.\n\nA few decades later, these hopes have not really materialized. It is\nprobably true that most people now argue more\u2014in social\nmedia, blogs, chat rooms, discussion boards etc.\u2014but it is much\nless obvious that they argue better. Indeed, rather than\nenhancing democratic ideals, some have gone as far as claiming that\ninstead, the Internet is \u201ckilling democracy\u201d (Bartlett\n2018). There is very little oversight when it comes to the spreading\nof propaganda and disinformation online (Benkler, Faris, & Roberts\n2018), which means that citizens are often being fed faulty\ninformation and arguments. Moreover, it seems that online environments\nmay lead to increased polarization when polemic topics are being\ndiscussed (Yardi & Boyd 2010), and to \u201cintellectual\narrogance\u201d (Lynch 2019). Some have argued that online\ndiscussions lead to more overly emotional engagement when compared to\nother forms of debate (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock 2014). But not\neveryone is convinced that the Internet has only made things worse\nwhen it comes to argumentation, or in any case that it cannot be\nsuitably redesigned so as to foster rather than destroy democratic\nideals and deliberation (Sunstein 2017).\n\nBe that as it may, the Internet is here to stay, and online\nargumentation is a pervasive phenomenon that argumentation theorists\nhave been studying and will continue to study for years to come. In\nfact, if anything, online argumentation is now more often\ninvestigated empirically than other forms of argumentation, among\nother reasons thanks to the development of argument mining techniques\n(see\n section 4.2\n above) which greatly facilitate the study of large corpora of textual\nmaterial such as those produced by online discussions. Beyond the very\nnumerous specific case studies available in the literature, there have\nbeen also attempts to reflect on the phenomenon of online\nargumentation in general, for example in journal special issues\ndedicated to argumentation in digital media such as in\nArgumentation and Advocacy (Volume 47(2), 2010) and\nPhilosophy & Technology (Volume 30(2), 2017). However, a\nsystematic analysis of online argumentation and how it differs from\nother forms of argumentation remains to be produced.\n",
