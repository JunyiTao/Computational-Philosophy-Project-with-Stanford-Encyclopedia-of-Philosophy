Social and Political Thought\n\nAs Laura Dassow Walls has noted, Humboldt\u2019s political analysis\nand critique of imperialism and slavery, \u201chowever valuable, did\nnot lie at the core of his thinking on race\u201d. This is because,\nWalls explicates, Humboldt \u201cthought of himself above all as a\nnatural scientist\u2026\u201d (Walls 2009: 181). Thus, despite his\nardent critique of slavery and of the colonial project more generally,\nhe did not articulate this critique in a systematic way, nor did he\nwrite any one work that directly deals with political and social\nquestions. Instead, we find statements concerning slavery strewn\nthroughout his works, without a detailed analysis or critique of the\npractice, or of the European treatment of Indigenous peoples.\n\nWhile Humboldt may have not systematically addressed social and\npolitical questions, it is clear that these questions were deeply\nimportant to him. As he puts it in an 1858 letter to the German\nintellectual Julius Fr\u00f6bel (1805\u20131893), the future of\nAmerican slavery is \u201cnearer my heart\u201d than the elevations\nof mountains. In the same letter, Humboldt describes his Essai\npolitique sur l\u2019ile de Cuba as a \u201cbook against\nslavery\u201d, deploring the fact that while the book is widely\naccessible in Madrid, it remains censored in the United States (Foner\n1984: 23\u201324).\n\nHumboldt\u2019s understanding of the idea of a \u201crace\u201d and\nhis critique of slavery were well-established prior to his arrival in\nthe Americas (L\u2019ile de Cuba 1: 307; DA 3: 155; PN 7:\n260). His view, which contrasts with Kant\u2019s but coheres with\nHerder\u2019s and Forster\u2019s, was that there are no different\nraces, but, as he puts it in Kosmos, that all human beings\nare of \u201cone species\u201d, and all \u201care alike designed\nfor freedom\u201d (Kosmos 1: 187; CO 1: 368). For this\nreason, Humboldt criticizes those philosophers who used philosophical\nmeans to support the idea that human beings belong to different and\nunequal races, writing that \n\n\nthe very cheerless and in recent times too often discussed doctrine of\nunequal human rights to freedom, and of slavery as an institution in\nconformity with nature, is unhappily found most systematically\ndeveloped in Aristotle\u2019s Politica. (Kosmos 1:\n187 n. 442; CO 1: 368n)\n\n\nFrom this one might suspect that Humboldt\u2019s views on slavery and\nhis critique of the colonial social system may be connected to his\nlarger project: to his understanding of nature as an integrated whole,\nto his view that nature and culture are interconnected, and to his\naesthetic approach to the study of both.\n\nThis is evident, for instance, in his caution towards ethnographic\nresearch that is often hasty in drawing conclusions, and tends to\nessentialize race without adequately recognizing differences\nwithin cultures\u2014or the connections among\ncultures. Both differences within cultures and connections across\ncultures are evident, Humboldt writes, as soon as one pays close\nattention to languages, which reveals that \n\n\ntotally different linguistic families have been found to exist in one\nand the same race [and] the same idioms can be found among people of\nvery different descent. (Kosmos 1: 187; CO 1: 368) \n\n\nThe diversity within languages, in other words, points to a diversity\nwithin cultures\u2014such that speaking of cultures as monolithic and\nisolated entities, and, on that basis, essentializing and\nhierarchizing cultures and races, is nothing other than a false\nabstraction based on overhasty (or simply bad) research.\n\nIn the same volume in which Humboldt describes slavery as the greatest\nevil humanity has wrought upon itself, he notes the significance not\nonly of our natural environment on our sensibility, but also of our\nsocial-political environment, and the ways in which certain political\ncontexts can inhibit moral concerns. \u201cIn climates where slavery\nexists\u201d, he writes, \u201cthe mind is familiarized with\nsuffering, and that instinct of pity is stifled which characterizes\nand ennobles our nature\u201d (PN 7: 464). Just as the natural\nenvironment affects sensibility, so also does our social and political\nenvironment. In a context where slavery is accepted and widely\npracticed, Humboldt claims, moral instincts are disturbed and\nsuppressed. This is because, as Humboldt repeatedly argues in relation\nto the natural environment, how one perceives and thinks\ncannot be separated from the world of which one is part. Sensibility\nand understanding are enmeshed in the world, even as they also\nconstruct it. A world in which slavery is practiced is a world that\ndisturbs our moral compass.\n\nFurthermore, by placing human cultures squarely within the natural\nworld, and showing how \u201cnature\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d\ncannot be conceptually separated from one another, Humboldt arrives at\nthe conclusion that the destruction of nature will lead to the\ndestruction of culture. Though he notes that these effects are most\nacutely felt by Indigenous cultures, he is clear that it is human\nculture at large that will suffer from the destruction of nature.\nWhether it is the mass deforestation connected to the Spanish desire\nto transform the South American landscape to resemble \u201cin every\nway the soil of Castile, arid and devoid of vegetation\u201d, or the\nthoughtless construction of new cities, dams and underground tunnels,\nthe destruction of nature has been catastrophic for all cultures\n(Nouvelle-Espagne 2: 128\u20139; KNS 1: 328). Or, as he puts\nit in Voyage,\n\n\nThe changes which the destruction of forests, the clearing of plants\nand the cultivation of indigo have produced within half a\ncentury\u2014in the quantity of water flowing in, on the one hand,\nand on the other, the evaporation from the soil and the dryness of the\natmosphere\u2014present causes sufficiently powerful to explain the\nsuccessive diminution of the lake of Valencia. I am not of the opinion\nof a scientific traveller [M. Depons] (who was in these countries\nafter I was there) \u201cthat to set the mind at rest, and for the\nhonour of science [l\u2019honneur de la physique]\u201d, a\nsubterranean issue must be admitted. By felling the trees which cover\nthe tops and the sides of mountains, men in every climate prepare at\nonce two calamities for future generations: want of fuel and scarcity\nof water. (Voyage 2: 71\u20132; PN 4: 142\u20133;\ntranslation altered)\n\n\nIn contrast to Depons, who claims that significant changes to the\nnatural landscape have nothing to do with the colonial project and\ninstead points to \u201csubterranean issues\u201d, Humboldt\ncontends\u2014some two-hundred years before the coinage of the term\nAnthropocene\u2014that the European transformation of the landscape\ndirectly resulted in the decrease of Lake Valencia, and, as he\nconcludes with some horror, will result in further future calamities.\n\n",
