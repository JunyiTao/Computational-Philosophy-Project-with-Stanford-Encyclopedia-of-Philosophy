    "main_text": "Currents\n3. Currents\n\nLike existentialism, hermeneutics, phenomenology, and\npoststructuralism, the philosophy of liberation was never a\nhomogeneous or monolithic movement. From its inception the philosophy\nof liberation was marked by internal tensions, which over time have\nbecome more intense, but that have also led to philosophical\ndevelopments that have taken the original theses to new levels of\nrefinement and theoretical elaboration. Cerutti Guldberg, who has\nwritten the most substantive and comprehensive study of liberation\nphilosophy, has offered a typology of the internal currents that names\nfour different currents (Cerutti Guldberg 1983, 1988\u20139, 2006).\nBeorlegui, writing more recently, argues that there are in fact six\ncurrents, though he accepts Cerutti Guldberg\u2019s four as being the\ncore and originating current (Beorlegui 2004: 695\u2013727). These\nfour currents will now be discussed sequentially.\n",
