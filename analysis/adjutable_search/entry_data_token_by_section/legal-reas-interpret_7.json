    "main_text": "The Role of Coherence in Legal Reasoning: || What Constitutes Coherence?\n3.1 What Constitutes Coherence?\n\n\nTwo central questions must be addressed in considering the role of\ncoherence in legal reasoning: what is the nature of the coherence\nrelation which features in coherence accounts of adjudication, and what\nrole does coherence play in explaining or justifying judicial decisions\nin such accounts? \n\n\nAmongst those legal theorists taking an interest in the role of\ncoherence in legal reasoning, there is general agreement both that the\ncoherence in question must amount to more than logical consistency\namongst propositions (see Kress 1984; MacCormick 1984; Marmor 1992\n& 2005; Alexy & Peczenik 1990) and that it is not clear from\nmany coherence accounts exactly what this something more amounts to\n(see Kress 1984; Peczenik 1989; Marmor 1992). MacCormick 1984 views\ncoherence in terms of unity of principle in a legal system, contending\nthat the coherence of a set of legal norms consists in their being\nrelated either in virtue of being the realisation of some common value\nor values, or in virtue of fulfilling some common principle or\nprinciples. Raz 1994a also characterises coherence in law in terms of\nunity of principle. On his view, the more unified the set of\nprinciples underlying those court decisions and legislative acts which\nmake up the law, the more coherent law is.\n\n\nOther writers have attempted to supply a more formal definition of,\nfor example, a minimally coherent legal system (see Levenbook 1984), or\notherwise to flesh out in a more detailed manner the criteria of\ncoherence. Alexy and Peczenik 1990 define coherence in terms of the\ndegree of approximation to a perfect supportive structure exhibited by\na set of propositions, and list ten criteria by reference to which\ncoherence thus defined can be evaluated (the criteria are: (1) the\nnumber of supportive relations, (2) the length of the supportive\nchains, (3) the strength of the support, (4) the connections between\nsupportive chains, (5) priority orders between reasons, (6) reciprocal\njustification, (7) generality, (8) conceptual cross-connections, (9)\nnumber of cases a theory covers, and (10) diversity of fields of life\nto which the theory is applicable). Such an approach raises many\nquestions, such as how these various criteria of coherence are to be\nweighed and balanced against each other, and whether it is always the\ncase that the weighing operation will result in a complete ranking of\ngiven sets of propositions as either more or less coherent than each\nother, so that when faced with competing such sets, it is always\npossible to find the most coherent set of propositions according to the\nten criteria. Alexy and Peczenik recognise that weighing and balancing\nthe criteria of coherence will be a complex matter, but appear to\nassume that it will always be possible to establish which is the most\ncoherent of rival sets of propositions.\n\n\nA further characterisation of the kind of coherence which is to be\nsought in legal reasoning may be found in Ronald Dworkin's work. Many\nwriters regard Dworkin's account of integrity in adjudication as an\nexample of a coherence account. (See Hurley 1989 & 1990; Marmor\n1992 & 2005. Kress 1984, although writing before Dworkin had fully\ndeveloped his account of law as integrity, also views Dworkin as\noffering a coherence account of adjudication. Raz 1994a disputes the\nidea that Dworkin's account of law should be understood as a coherence\naccount.)  On this view, judges should try to realise the value of\ncoherence in judicial decisions by interpreting the law as\n\u2018speaking with one voice\u2019, i.e. they should identify legal\nrights and duties on the basis that they were all created by a single\nauthor, the community personified.\n",
