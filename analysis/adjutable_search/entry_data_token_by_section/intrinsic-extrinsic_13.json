    "main_text": "Attempts at Analysis || Contractionist Theories\n3.4 Contractionist Theories\n\nOne attractive idea is that a thing\u2019s intrinsic properties are\nthose properties it would have if it were alone in the world. An\nelegant theory of intrinsicality that develops this idea is that of\nPeter Vallentyne (1997).\n\nVallentyne defines a contraction of a world as \u201ca world\n\u2018obtainable\u2019 from the original one solely by\n\u2018removing\u2019 objects from it.\u201d (211) As a special case\nof this, an \\(x-t\\) contraction, where \\(x\\) is an object and \\(t\\) a\ntime, is \u201ca world \u2018obtainable\u2019 from the original one\nby, to the greatest extent possible, \u2018removing\u2019 all\nobjects wholly distinct from \\(x\\), all spatial locations not occupied\nby \\(x\\), and all times (temporal states of the world) except \\(t\\),\nfrom the world\u201d, as well as all laws of nature from the world.\n(211) Vallentyne claims that \\(F\\) is intrinsic iff, for any thing\n\\(x\\), for any time \\(t\\), and for any worlds \\(u\\) and \\(w\\) such\nthat \\(u\\) is an \\(x-t\\) contraction of \\(w, x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) at\n\\(u\\) iff \\(x\\) has \\(F\\) at \\(t\\) at \\(w\\). In short, a property is\nintrinsic to an object iff removing the rest of the world\ndoesn\u2019t change whether the object has the property.\nVallentyne\u2019s account classifies identity properties, like being\nObama, as intrinsic. It is therefore best seen as an account of\ninteriority. The account also classifies all indiscriminately\nnecessary properties as intrinsic. It is therefore arguably most\ncharitably interpreted as an account of metaphysical necessitation\ninteriority\n\nAs Vallentyne notes, this definition will not be very enlightening\nunless we understand the idea of a contraction. This seems related to\nthe objection Langton and Lewis (1998) urge against Vallentyne. They\nsay that Vallentyne\u2019s account reduces to the claim that a\nproperty is intrinsic iff possession of it never differs between an\nobject and its lonely duplicates, a claim they think is true but too\ntrivial to count as an analysis. Their position is that we cannot\nunderstand contractions without understanding duplication, but if we\nunderstand duplication then intrinsicality can be easily defined, so\nVallentyne\u2019s theory is no advance.\n\nThis criticism might be too quick. Stephen Yablo (1999) has argued\nthat Vallentyne should best be understood as working within a very\ndifferent metaphysical framework than Lewis. For Lewis, no (ordinary)\nobject exists at more than one world, so Vallentyne\u2019s\ncontractions, being separate worlds, must contain separate objects.\nHence \\(x-t\\) contractions can be nothing other than lonely\nduplicates, and the theory is trivial. Yablo suggests that the theory\nbecomes substantive relative to a metaphysical background in which the\nvery same object can appear in different worlds. If this is the case\nthen we can get a grip on contractions without thinking about\nduplications \u2014 the \\(x-t\\) contraction of a world is the world\nthat contains \\(x\\) itself, and as few other things as possible.\n\nThere are, however, problems with Yablo\u2019s defense of\nVallentyne\u2019s contractionist approach to intrinsicality. One\nproblem, discussed in Parsons 2007 and Marshall 2014, is that, on\nYablo\u2019s version of contractionism, we need to be able to make\nsense of sentences like \u2018In \\(w\\), Prince Philip is not a\nhusband\u2019, where \\(w\\) is the world consisting of just Prince\nPhilip. Making sense of such sentences, however, is difficult without\nappealing to the distinction between intrinsic and non-intrinsic\nproperties. Appealing to this distinction when interpreting\nYablo\u2019s account, however, would render it circular. \n",
