Faith and Philosophy: Eckhart\u2019s Hermeneutical Approach\n\nThe best way to understand Eckhart\u2019s views on the relationship\nbetween revelation and reason, faith and philosophy, is to explore its\nrelevance with respect to his views on the interpretation of Scripture\nin the Opus tripartitum\u2014a novel orientation toward\nexegesis that would become increasingly prominent in his later work,\nperhaps as a result of his encounter with Beguine spirituality (Ruh\n1996: 303; Largier 1998). To begin with, Eckhart explicitly maintains\nin several passages that the truths of Scripture are wholly\ncommensurate with those derivable via natural philosophy, and in the\nCommentary on John he writes that\n\n\nholy scripture can be interpreted [\u2026] so that what the\nphilosophers have written about the natures and properties of things\nagree with it, especially since everything that is true, whether in\nbeing or knowing, in scripture or in nature, proceeds from one source\nand one root of truth.\n\n\nHe even goes so far as to claim that\n\n\nMoses, Christ and the Philosopher teach the same thing, differing only\nin the way they teach, namely as worthy of belief [Moses], as probably\nor likely [Aristotle], and as truth [Christ]. (In Ioh. n.185;\nLW III:154\u20135; quoted in McGinn 1981: 27)\n\n\nImportantly, however, the exegetical tendency in Eckhart to blur the\nboundaries between theology and philosophy is not a matter of\ndownplaying the centrality of revelation; rather, it is more\nexpressive of his desire to demonstrate just how much philosophy can\nbe found \u201chidden under the image and surface of the literal\nsense\u201d of Scripture (In Gen. II n.1; LW I/2:333; EE 92;\ncf. also Tobin 1986: 25ff.).\n\nIn this sense, Eckhart\u2019s approach to the question of revelation\nand reason is less akin to later Enlightenment projects that would\nsubject purportedly revealed Scripture to rational verification.\nRather, it is just the other way around: reason and natural philosophy\ncan also be used to illuminate the truths and \u201chidden\nmeanings\u201d revealed in Scripture (Ruh 1996: 295). Unlike\nphilosophy, Eckhart thinks, Scripture by itself does not\nprove the truths revealed within it, but rather\n\u201cparabolically intimates in hidden fashion [\u2026] what we\n[elsewhere] prove and declare about matters divine, ethical and\nnatural\u201d (In Gen. II n.4; LW I/2:336; EE 95). The job\nof the exegete and the preacher, then, is to extract this hidden (or\n\u201cmystical\u201d) meaning from the text and to clarify it for\nthe audience, using whatever tools she has at her\ndisposal\u2014including those of rational argumentation and natural\nphilosophy. Thus, in his discussion of John 1:1 (\u201cIn the\nbeginning was the Word\u201d), Eckhart notes that\n\n\nin interpreting this Word and everything else that follows my\nintention is the same as in all my works\u2014to explain what the\nholy Christian faith and the two Testaments maintain through the help\nof the natural arguments of the philosophers. (In Ioh. n.2;\nLW III:4; EE 122\u20133)\n\n\nHowever, unlike the traditional \u201cfourfold\u201d hermeneutical\nmethod employed by many medieval scholars, which usually appeals to\neach of the literal/historical, allegorical, moral/tropological, and\nanagogical/eschatological senses of particular Biblical passages in\nturn, Eckhart\u2019s biblical exegesis largely divorces what we today\nwould call the \u201cliteral\u201d reading of the text from the\nmeaning he draws out of it in ways that often strike modern readers as\nremarkably idiosyncratic. There is some evidence that Eckhart\u2019s\nhermeneutical method seems to have been intentionally\ndisruptive\u2014a way of shocking his medieval audiences out of their\ncomplacency and opening them up to new and \u201cdeeper\u201d ways\nof (philosophically, theologically, and spiritually) encountering\nfamiliar passages (Tobin 1986: 23). His so-called\n\u201cparabolic\u201d method takes a dehistoricized and\ndecontextualized approach to Scripture, in which a passage is\ndissected into individual words, phrases, or sentences, which are then\ngiven particular philosophical, theological, or metaphorical glosses\nand sometimes recombined with other similarly interpreted biblical\npassages in what McGinn calls \u201ca dense web of\nintertextuality\u201d (McGinn 2005: 112). It also provides multiple,\nnot necessarily commensurate interpretations, so that \u201cthe\nreader can freely take now one and now the other as seems useful to\nhim\u201d (In Ioh. n.39; LW III:33; EE 135). This pragmatic\napproach served an explicitly pastoral function, insofar as the\npreachers and clerics under Eckhart\u2019s tutelage would have\nencountered different situations in their vocations that might call\nfor different approaches to Scripture. But it was also intellectually\nlegitimate, Eckhart thought, insofar as every true sense \u201ccomes\nfrom the Truth itself\u201d (In Gen. II n.2; LW I/2:334; EE\n93). In fact, for Eckhart, all remotely true senses found in Scripture\ncan be understood as literal senses, \u201csince the literal\nsense is that which the author [\u2026] intends, and God is the\nauthor of holy scripture\u201d (ibid.).\n\nFrom an epistemic standpoint, Eckhart may have seen this polyphonic\nhermeneutical method as providing a way for finite and limited humans\nto mirror the infinite and all-encompassing divine\nperspective\u2014namely, by using a kind of deliberate\nmulti-perspectivity to achieve a more comprehensive and\nobjective \u201cGod\u2019s-eye view\u201d, one which (in the human\ncase) discursively subsumes all things under the unified aspect of the\ndivine logos, allowing the human mind to reflect, albeit\nimperfectly, the timeless, or eternally present,\nn\u00fb/nunc of the divine Intellect (McGinn 2005: 112).\n",
