Celestial motion and time\n\nIn 1271, Kilwardby, together with Thomas Aquinas and Albert the Great,\nreceived a questionnaire sent by the Master General of the Dominican\nOrder, John of Vercelli. The questionnaire, constituting 43 questions\nto be answered in a systematic order (forma taxata),\nsurveyed a wide range of theological problems, but the majority (25)\nwas concerned with the movement of the celestial bodies, its causes,\nand the possible influence upon the inferior (terrestrial) bodies. It\nincludes questions such as: Does God move any body immediately; if so,\nby a continuous everlasting movement, by a continuous but not\neverlasting movement, or by an instantaneous motion? (Q1) Are angels\nthe cause of the movement of the celestial bodies? (Q2)\n\nThe fifth question inquires about the cause of celestial motion.\nKilwardby considers three possible answers that he considers to be\neither (a) philosophically correct, (b) not to be approved either by\nphilosophy or by the saints, or (c) in agreement with philosophy.\n\n\n(a)\nAccording to Aristotle and others, celestial bodies are animate\nbeings that have intelligence and move by the power of will, in the\nsame way as human bodies are moved by their souls (D43Q 2, 14).\nKilwardby himself defends this view in his LSP and DOS (Lewry 1978,\n324\u20135; DOS 20).\n(b)\nCelestial bodies are moved by angels. Kilwardby dismisses this\nanswer by arguing that the motion of the celestial bodies needs to be\nnatural, in other words the principle of motion must be internal to\nthe thing moved (if the cause is external, the motion is violent)\n(D43Q 2, 12; see also E 2, 24\u201325). If angels moved celestial\nbodies, their motion would be violent. In spite of this objection,\nKilwardby leaves open the possibility for this view, diplomatically\nstating that because he does not know, he cannot assert it (quia\nnescio, asserere nolo) (D43Q 10, 19; 15, 21).\n(c)\nAccording to some, the cause of the motion of the celestial bodies\nis their own weight and inclination (instinctu propriorum\nponderum: D43Q 3, 192), in the same way as heavy and light bodies\nare moved by their own weight and inclination (propriis ponderibus\net inclinationibus: D43Q 2, 14).\n\n\n\nIn Kilwardby\u2019s own words:\n\nJust as heavy and light bodies are moved to a place in which they rest\nby their own inclinations and tendencies, so celestial bodies are\nmoved circularly in place by their own inclinations similar to the\nweight (quasi ponderibus) in order to conserve corruptible\nthings, lest they suddenly perish and fail. (trans. Weisheipl 1961,\n315).\n\n\nKilwardby\u2019s theory is, however, not absolutely original, as scholars\n(in particular Weisheipl) have shown. In fact, some sixty years\nearlier, John Blund argued for the same explanation in his\nTractaus de anima (paragraph 10); here he stated that heaven\n(including all celestial spheres) is moved by nature and not by the\nsoul or celestial beings. This view seemed to go unnoticed until\nKilwardby referred to it; originality claims apart, the significance\nof Kilwardby\u2019s statement must be emphasized. The interest of his\nsolution is in how it harmonizes a natural explanation for the\nphenomenon of celestial motion \u2013 designating the instinct of\ntheir [the celestial bodies\u2019] own weight as its cause \u2013 while at\nthe same time it safeguards God\u2019s influence in the natural world: God\nis not the direct mover, but the one who endows these bodies with\ntheir instinct (D43Q 2, 14; see Silva 2007 for references).\nTime\n\nOne of the questions Kilwardby addresses in his treatise On\ntime (De tempore)\u2014written most probably after\nDOS\u2014is whether time, as the measure of motion, is defined in\nrelation to the diurnal motion (DT 35), a view identified with\nAverroes. The aim of his treatise is to understand time in such a way\nthat it reveals compatibility between Aristotle\u2019s (Physics\nIV, 10\u201314) definition of time\u2014which Kilwardby calls\n\u2018physical\u2019\u2014as relative to motion (and motion\nrelative to continuous quantity) and the Augustinian\n(Confessions XI) definition of time\u2014which he calls\n\u2018metaphysical\u2019\u2014as an extension (distensio)\nof the mind, thus existing only in the mind (DT 10\u201311).\nKilwardby\u2019s solution is to argue for a distinction between\nindeterminate and determinate time: on the one hand, indeterminate\ntime exists outside of and independent from the numbering mind (it is\nneither numbered nor measured) as, prior to any measuring, that which\nis measured is already in motion (DT 77). Determinate time, on the\nother hand, has existence in the mind only, as it can only exist in\nthe measuring mind. In Kilwardby\u2019s own words, \u201ctime comes into\nexistence when we perceive the direction of that which is earlier and\nlater in motion\u201d (DT 77). Time is, therefore, the measure not of\nany specific motion but the measure of motion (DT 42) defined by an\ninstant before and an instant after. The quantity of motion between\nthese two instants, before and after, has a numerical expression (DT\n34), and this number is then used to measure all other motions (DT\n49): time \u201cmeasures the whole motion by determining the motion\nwhich will measure the whole\u201d (DT 27). Time is the number of\nmotion because number is the appropriate name for that\n measure.[31]\n We determine time by measuring motion according to fixed measures\n(days, hours, and so on) (DT 77). As the measure for any kind of\nmotion, time has unity.\n\nTime, hence, is dependent for its definition on motion (NSLP 7, 54).\nThe continuous nature of motion is essential to guarantee the\ncontinuous nature of time (DT 12). Time needs to be continuous for it\nto measure continuous motion (NSLP 8, 58). The continuity of motion,\nin turn, is guaranteed by the continuity of the parts that constitute\nthe moving thing (DT 17). Kilwardby argues that time and motion are\nexceptions to the rule according to which the parts of composite\nthings must exist simultaneously; instead, he claims, that they are\ncomposite transient things, and the parts of time are successive (DT\n7\u20139). Time has its being from the ordination of its parts into\nbefore and after (NSLP 8, 58). The instant (the now: nunc) is\nfrom the point of view of the substance which is always the same but\ndifferent in the manner of its existence (DT 89). Time is the measure\nof continuous motion, and the instant is the measure of one of the\nmoments of that continuous alteration (DT 94\u201395). For Kilwardby,\ncelestial motion as measured by time is the standard for measuring all\nother motions (see Trifogli 2013; for other aspects of Kilwardby\u2019s\ntreatment of time, namely the connections to his contemporaries, see\nPorro 1996.)\n",
