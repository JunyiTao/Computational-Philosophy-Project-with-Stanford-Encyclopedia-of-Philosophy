    "main_text": "Evidentialism: an overview || Strict vs. moderate\n4.1 Strict vs. moderate\n\nEvidentialism of some sort is far and away the dominant ethic of\nbelief among early modern and contemporary philosophers alike. The\ncentral principle, as mentioned earlier, is that one ought only to\nbase one's beliefs on relevant evidence (i.e. evidence that bears on\nthe truth of the proposition) that is in one's possession. Many\nEvidentialists (Locke, Hume, and Clifford, for example) add the\ncondition that the amount of evidence in one's possession must be\nproportioned to one's degree of belief, and that one should only\nfirmly believe on the basis of \u201csufficient\u201d\nevidence (where \u201csufficient\u201d involves the evidence being\nstrong enough for the belief to count as knowledge if true). Some also\nadd one of the reflective access requirements mentioned above: for\ninstance, that we ought to know (or being a position to know, or\njustifiably believe, or be justified in believing) that we have\nevidence for the original belief or even that the amount of evidence\nwe have is sufficient (for a survey of these positions and their\ncritics, see the essays in Dougherty 2011).\n\nOnce a principle along these lines has been chosen, the relative\nstrictness of a given Evidentialist position will be a function of how\nmany exceptions it allows. The strictest sort of\nEvidentialist\u2014Clifford, at least on standard readings\u2014says\nthat the principle holds \u201calways, everywhere, and for\nanyone\u201d (though note, again, that Clifford himself qualifies\nthis later in his essay). There are problems with such a strict\nposition, however, including the threat of the infinite regress that\narises if the strict Evidentialist also requires that we\nbelieve that we have sufficient evidence for all of our\nbeliefs.\n\nIn contrast, moderate Evidentialists take their principles to be\nexceptionable; thus they allow that there are some circumstances in\nwhich subjects are rationally permitted to form beliefs in the absence\nof sufficient evidence. They might hold that the Cliffordian view\napplies, say, to the beliefs formed by a military pilot about the\nlocation of a legitimate bombing target in the midst of a residential\narea, or the beliefs formed by a government health official regarding\nthe efficacy of a pharmaceutical trial, at least insofar as these\nbeliefs lead to morally or prudentially significant actions. But at\nthe same time they might think it permissible to abandon these strict\nstandards in ordinary contexts where not much is at stake\u2014for\ninstance, the everyday belief that there is still some milk in the\nfridge. If the number of exceptions is very large, then the position\nends up looking more like one of the Non-Evidentialist positions\ndescribed below. As a result, the boundary between a very moderate\nEvidentialism and full-blown Non-Evidentialism can be quite\nblurry.\n\nAs difficult as it is to defend strict or thoroughgoing Evidentialism,\nit is even harder to defend the view that Evidentialism is\ninappropriate in every domain. The cases of the pilot and the\nhealth official are ones in which the subject's beliefs (largely as a\nresult of the actions to which they lead) simply must, we think, meet\nsome very high standards of evidence. Accordingly, at least some sort\nof moderate or context-specific Evidentialism seems overwhelmingly\nplausible.\n\nWe have seen that the distinction between strict Evidentialism and\nmoderate Evidentialism is quite sharp but that the line between\nmoderate Evidentialism and Non-Evidentialism is rather blurry. Perhaps\nthe best place to make a distinction between moderate Evidentialism\nand full-blown Non-Evidentialism is over whether a subject can be not\nonly permitted but also obliged to form a belief on\ninsufficient evidence (or, depending on the reflective access\nconditions, on what she takes to be insufficient evidence) in certain\nsituations. An ethicist of belief who affirms this, it seems\nreasonable to say, has thereby abandoned even the most moderate form\nof Evidentialism and moved into the Non-Evidentialist camp (see\n\u00a76 below).\n",
