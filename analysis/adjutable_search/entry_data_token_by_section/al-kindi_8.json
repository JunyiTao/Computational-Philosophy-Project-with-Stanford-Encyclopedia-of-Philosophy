    "main_text": "Psychology || Epistemology\n4.2 Epistemology\n\n\nThis rigorously dualist psychology has far-reaching effects in\nal-Kindi\u2019s epistemology and ethics. It is clear from the\nDiscourse that when al-Kindi speaks of the soul as separate\nfrom body, even during our worldly life, he is referring only to the\nintellective or rational soul. While this does not by itself rule out\nthat intellection and reason are somehow grounded in bodily experience,\nal-Kindi does not pursue an empiricist program in contexts where he\naddresses epistemological issues.\n\n\nThe most important text on epistemology is al-Kindi\u2019s\nbest-known work apart from On First Philosophy, namely On\nthe Intellect (Abu Rida 1950, 353\u20138; also McCarthy 1964,\nRuffinengo 1997). This treatise has received an unusual amount of\nattention, despite its brevity and compressed argument, because it is\nthe first Arabic work to show the influence of Greek taxonomies of the\nintellect into levels or types. (See especially Jolivet 1971, with\nEndress 1980.) These taxonomies, with various versions put forward by\nAlexander, Themistius, Philoponus and other commentators, were in turn\nattempts to systematize Aristotle\u2019s remarks on intellect in\nDe Anima book 3 and elsewhere.\n\n\nFar from grounding intellect in sensation, al-Kindi argues in On\nthe Intellect that the human intellect has a parallel, but\nseparate, function to human sense-perception. (For a similar contrast\nsee also On First Philosophy, section 2.) Just like sensation,\nthe human intellect in itself begins in a state of potentiality. This\nis the first type of intellect, the potential intellect, which is\nmerely an ability to grasp intellectual forms. Once it grasps a form\nand is actually thinking, it becomes \u201cactual intellect.\u201d We\nare then able to think about these forms at will. Our ability to do so\nis what al-Kindi calls the \u201cacquired intellect\u201d (not to be\nconfused with \u201cacquired intellect\u201d in al-Farabi, who means\nby this a comprehensive attainment of the many intellectual forms).\nNotice that these types of intellect are really only the same, human\nintellect in three different states: wholly potential, wholly actual,\nand temporarily potential but able to actualize at will.\n\n\nBut how in the first place do we get from potential intellect to\nactual intellection? It is here that al-Kindi might have told some sort\nof empiricist story, perhaps involving abstraction; such a story plays\nat least some role in al-Kindi\u2019s successors al-Farabi and\nAvicenna. But instead al-Kindi gives a thoroughly intellectualist\naccount of how we come to think, one which is parallel to, but distinct\nfrom, his account of sensation. Just as sensation is actualized by an\nexternal sensible form, so intellect is actualized by an external\nintelligible form. This form will reside in the final type of\nintellect, the \u201cfirst intellect,\u201d which is al-Kindi\u2019s\nversion of the infamous \u201cmaker intellect\u201d in\nAristotle\u2019s De Anima 3.5. While it is unclear what\nposition this first intellect is meant to have in al-Kindi\u2019s\nontology, it is clear that it is distinct from human intellect. The\nfirst intellect is \u201calways in act,\u201d which means that it can\nserve as an external source for intelligible forms, just as sensible\nobject serves as an external source for a sensible form.\n\n\nWe get some sense of how al-Kindi might have applied this highly\nintellectualist epistemology in specific contexts from works on\nrecollection and on dreams. His On Recollection (for which see\nEndress 1986 and 1994) argues explicitly that we cannot derive\nintelligible forms from sense-perception. Thus we do not\n\u201clearn\u201d these forms, but simply \u201cremember\u201d them\nfrom before the soul entered into the body. Here al-Kindi is of course\nbroadly following the account of recollection given by Plato in the\nMeno or Phaedo, though how he might have known of\nthis account remains obscure. (Most likely it is from an Arabic\nversion, perhaps in summary, of the Phaedo.)\n\n\nA longer and more detailed text is On Sleep and Dream (Abu\nRida 1950, 293\u2013311; also Ruffinengo 1997), which gives a naturalistic\naccount of why prophetic dreams occur, and how they may be interpreted.\nHere al-Kindi\u2019s chief source was Aristotle\u2019s Parva\nNaturalia, which include the works On Sleep, On\nDreams, and On Prophecy in Sleep. The extant Arabic\nversion of these texts, which may well be related to the version used\nby al-Kindi, is importantly different from the Greek version, in that\nit admits that genuinely prophetic dreams can be sent from God (cf.\nPines 1974). If al-Kindi knew this version then he follows it only in\npart: he embraces the idea of prophetic dreams, but does not claim that\nthey come to us from God. To explain dreams al-Kindi invokes a faculty\nwe have not yet discussed, namely imagination or phantasia.\nFollowing Aristotle, al-Kindi says that dreams occur when we are\nsleeping because the senses are no longer active, and the imagination\nhas free rein to conjure up forms on its own. We are also given a\nphysiological account of sleep, which departs from Aristotle by placing\nthe imaginative faculty in the brain. Whereas Aristotle has some\ndifficulty explaining, and is in fact rather skeptical about, the\nphenomenon of prophetic dreams, al-Kindi is enthusiastic about them. He\neven explains the various types of dream, with their accuracy\ndetermined by the physical state of the brain. But despite the\nphysiological aspects of al-Kindi\u2019s account, the fundamental\nexplanatory work is done by the incorporeal soul, which\n\u201cannounces\u201d its visions of the future to the imagination.\nAgain, the rational soul grasps its objects by itself. Tellingly,\nal-Kindi thinks that sensation hinders this power of the soul, rather\nthan contributing anything to it.\n",
