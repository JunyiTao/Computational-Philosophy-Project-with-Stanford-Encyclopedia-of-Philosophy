    "main_text": "\n\nQing philosophy refers to the topography of the intellectual terrain\nof seventeenth- and eighteenth-century China, which sported coherent\npatterns and modes of intellection and argumentation among the texts\nand writings of the scholars in the period. In accordance with the\ncurrent historiographical convention, the time-span fell within the\nso-called \u201clate imperial\u201d era that encompassed the\ntransition from the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) to the Qing\n(1644\u20131911), as well as the first half of the Qing imperium.\nThat Qing philosophy is distinguished as an independent subject and\nentity, with its presumed boundaries and prominent features, is not\nmerely a function of chronology. Rather, it points to a substantial\ndeparture from the preceding intellectual traditions, which in their\naggregate form, amounted to Neo-Confucianism of the Song\n(960\u20131279) and Ming times. While Neo-Confucianism was not a\nmonolith to be sure, to the extent that it argued robustly on behalf\nof individual moral introspection via one\u2019s nature\n(xing) and mind-heart (xin) as the realization of\nultimate metaphysical truths\u2014variously construed as heaven\n(tian), principle (li), the great ultimate\n(taiji), and the Way (dao)\u2014it represented the\nforemost unfolding and predictive reality-principle that was Song-Ming\nthought in its totality. Qing philosophy, being in many ways a\nnegative reaction to it, was a rupture to begin with, even though in\nterms of intellectual history, multifarious aspects of continuity,\napart from discontinuity, must be taken into account. \n\nIt is important to note that the coherent patterns and modes\nidentified with Qing philosophy are my own narrative and interpretive\nconstructions for the purpose of limning the lineaments of the\nintellectual landscape of a time. They are analytical categories that\nresult from my hermeneutic intervention within the intellectual\nhistory of late imperial China, the coherent features of which might\nnot have been evident to contemporary scholars in the Qing. In short,\nQing philosophy is a constructed period concept that denotes a\ndistinct worldview with a specific temporal location.\n\nThe present essay begins, in section 1, with a synthetic\nconceptualization of Qing philosophy as a period concept that conveys\nboth substantive intellectual contents and a particular temporal\nposition. From historiographical and historical vantage points, it\nargues on behalf of the distinctiveness of the modes and patterns of\nphilosophical intellection in Qing times, identifying their departure\nfrom antecedent Song-Ming thoughts while paying due attention to\naspects of continuity. These dominant manners of intellection that\ncharacterize Qing philosophy are represented by four ideal-types of\nthinking\u2014vitalism, historicism, utilitarianism, and\nintellectualism. Together, they furnished the fundamental orientations\nand standards by which learning was pursued, adjudicated, and\nevaluated in the Qing period.\n\nAccordingly, the rest of the essay is organized around the individual\nand respective examinations of the four ideal-types of philosophical\nthinking, and hence the quadripartite structure. Section 2 explores\nvitalism as the philosophical emphasis on qi (material force\nor psycho-physical force) as the metaphysical fulcrum on which the\nworld turns. Section 3 reveals the ways in which historicism\nengendered the tendency to seek meaning in human agency by\nappreciating particular contingencies in changing contexts.\nUtilitarianism, elucidated in section 4, is my hermeneutic rendering\nof the Confucian activist ideal of ordering the world by extending\nutility and function to the fullest (jingshi).\nIntellectualism, also discussed in section 4, is a representation of\nthe Confucian quest for external, discursive knowledge, most vividly\nand concertedly manifested in the intellectual movement of evidentiary\nresearch (kaozheng). \n",
