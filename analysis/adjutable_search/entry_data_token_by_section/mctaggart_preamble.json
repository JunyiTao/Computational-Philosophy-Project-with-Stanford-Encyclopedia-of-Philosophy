    "main_text": "\n\n\nJohn McTaggart Ellis McTaggart, henceforth simply\n\u201cMcTaggart\u201d, was one of the most important systematic\nmetaphysicians of the early 20th century. His greatest work\nis The Nature of Existence, the first volume of which was\npublished in 1921 while the second volume was published posthumously\nin 1927 with C.D. Broad as the editor of the manuscript. In addition,\nhe authored many important articles on metaphysics, including his\nfamous \u201cThe Unreality of Time\u201d in 1908, some of which are\ncollected in his Philosophical Studies (1934). \n\n\nMcTaggart was also a dedicated interpreter and champion of Hegel, and\nin addition to many articles on the Hegelian philosophy, he published\nthe following books: Studies in the Hegelian Dialectic (1896,\n2nd edition printed in 1922), which contains a painstaking\ndiscussion of the nature of the dialectic as well as the results\nachieved by its means, many of which are conclusions that McTaggart\ncontinued to argue for throughout his career, including among them\nthat time is unreal, that existence exhausts reality, that modal\nnotions cannot be applied to reality as a whole, and that absolute\nreality contains imperfections; Studies in Hegelian Cosmology\n(1901, 2nd edition printed in 1918), in which cosmology is\nunderstood as the discipline that applies a priori conclusions to\nthose entities and features that we are acquainted with via\nexperience, such as selves, the universe, and good and evil, and in\nwhich topics ranging from the ethical status of punishment and the\nnature of sin to whether the absolute is a person, whether human\nbeings are immortal, or whether Hegel is a Christian are discussed in\ngreat detail; and A Commentary on Hegel\u2019s Logic (1910), which\nconsists of a critical commentary on the alleged logical connections\nbetween various categories by which experience must be organized and\nthe various transitions that lead one from Hegel\u2019s category of Being\nto the category of Absolute Idea.\n\n\nThe extent to which McTaggart\u2019s interpretations of Hegel are\ncorrect is not a matter on which I am competent to determine. For what\nit is worth, McTaggart\u2019s work on Hegel does not appear to be\nhighly regarded by contemporary scholars of Hegel, insofar as this is\nreflected in the paucity of references to\nMcTaggart\u2019s\n interpretations.[1]\nIn what follows, I will spend little time on those works of McTaggart\nthat occupy themselves with the Hegelian philosophy. This is\nunfortunate, since this might give the impression that grappling with\nHegel\u2019s philosophy was merely a side project for McTaggart rather\nthan a task of much importance for his philosophical development. In\nhis Commentary on Hegel\u2019s Logic, McTaggart tells us that\nthe exposition of Hegel\u2019s philosophy has been the chief object of\nhis life for the last twenty-one\n years (Commentary on Hegel\u2019s Logic, 311).\nMcTaggart\u2019s Hegelianism was also\nimportant for the development of other philosophers such as Bertrand\nRussell, whose early work was inspired by the idealism defended by\nMcTaggart in his Studies of the Hegelian\n Dialectic.[2]\n However, it is\nworth noting that McTaggart himself later abandoned the dialectical\nmethod that he took to be central to Hegel\u2019s own\nmetaphysics.\n\n\nThe plan for this article is as follows. Section 1 will provide\nbiographical information about McTaggart. I will then begin to discuss\nthe central themes of McTaggart\u2019s philosophy. Section 2 focuses on\nMcTaggart\u2019s views on the methods of metaphysics. Section 3 discusses\nMcTaggart\u2019s famous argument for the unreality of time.  Section 4 will\nfocus on McTaggart\u2019s philosophy of religion, which was a kind of\natheistic mysticism. Section 5 will focus on\nMcTaggart\u2019s ontological idealism, which is a view akin to the\nidealism of Leibniz and Berkeley. Section 6 will focus on McTaggart\u2019s\nposition on what was perhaps the central metaphysical debate of his\nperiod, namely, the issue of monism vs.\npluralism as well as the concordant issue of the reality of\nrelations. Section 7 will be devoted to a smorgasbord of topics of\ninterest to contemporary metaphysicians, including McTaggart\u2019s\nviews on parts and wholes, the distinction between existence\nand reality, and questions about essentialism.\n\n\nSection 8 will be the final part of this article, and will focus on\nMcTaggart\u2019s views on ethics. I will discuss McTaggart\u2019s views on the\nnature of intrinsic value, focusing on the questions of to what\nontological category the bearers of intrinsic value belong and what\nkinds of features determine the intrinsic value of these entities.  I\nwill also discuss McTaggart\u2019s views on love, the emotion that he\naccords the highest place in his ethical system.\n",
