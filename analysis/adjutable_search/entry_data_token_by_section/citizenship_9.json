    "main_text": "Citizenship\u2019s new frontier?\n4. Citizenship\u2019s new frontier?\n\nDespite their many differences, the conceptions of citizenship\ndiscussed in the preceding sections share the idea that citizenship\nsupposes a certain kind of agency, one that involves the\nindividual\u2019s capacity to reflect on his/her subjective good as\nwell as on the good of the whole. And this has long been associated,\nin the Western tradition, to a complex discursive capacity that only\nhuman beings are thought to possess. Following Aristotle:\n\n[W]hereas mere voice is but an indicator of pleasure or pain and is\ntherefore found in other animals (\u2026), the power of speech is\nintended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and therefore\nlikewise the just and the unjust. And it is characteristic of man that\nhe alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the\nlike, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a\nfamily and a state (Aristotle, 1996, 1253a10\u20131253a18).\n\n\nThe capacity for rational agency has long functioned as a threshold\ncondition for citizenship. In Aristotle\u2019s Politics, for\nexample, the exclusion of women and slaves from citizenship is based\non an account of their souls as lacking the appropriate kind of\nrationality. The long history of the extension of citizenship to\ngroups previously excluded did not change this basic understanding. It\ninvolved the recognition that the newly included (e.g. women, workers,\ndescendants of former slaves) did, in fact, satisfy the threshold\ncondition.\n\nContemporary democratic and republican theories often rely on an ideal\npicture of the citizen as actively involved in the political life of\nthe community. This encompasses a vast array of activities and\npractices, including voting in elections, canvassing, participating in\npublic deliberation, demonstrating against government decisions or\npolicies, etc. These activities all presuppose the capacity for a\ncertain kind of agency, one that relies heavily on rational,\ndiscursive abilities. This common view sits uncomfortably with the\nfact that many individuals \u2014 in some cases because of deep\ncognitive disability \u2014 do not have these capacities. Though they\nmay be members of the society, can they \u2014 truly \u2014 be\ncitizens? From Locke to Rawls, the answer has been overwhelmingly\nnegative, confining these individuals to the category of wards (Arneil\n2009 and 2016, Pinheiro 2016, Clifford Simplican 2016). Though society\nmay have the responsibility to ensure their welfare, they can have no\nsay in its definition, and are fated to remain society\u2019s passive\nbeneficiaries.\n\nOver the last forty years, disability advocates and scholars have\ncontested this view of the disabled, insisting that they should be\nseen and treated as citizens, not as wards. Some philosophers and\npolitical theorists have rallied to this view and questioned the\nconception of agency presupposed in the conventional view of\ndemocratic citizenship as unduly exclusionary (Nussbaum 2006, Arneil\n2009, Arneil and Hirschmann 2016). Building on the work of disability\ntheorists, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka (2011, 2016) have argued\nfurther that if one accepts \u2014 as one should \u2014 that a\ncapacity for complex discursive agency is not necessary for\ncitizenship, then one should also recognize domestic animals as\nco-citizens since they qualify as members of\n society.[28]\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka define agency as \u201cself-willed or\ninitiated action that carries an expectation of efficacy\u201d\n(Donaldson and Kymlicka 2016, 180, fn 16). On this view, agency does\nnot require discursive rationality and individuals with deep cognitive\ndisability as well as domestic animals can be described as agents. The\nscope of agency is conceptualized into two parts: micro (the capacity\nto have a say over everyday choices) and macro (the capacity of\nindividuals to shape the \u201cfundamental dimensions of their\nlives\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2016, 180)). In Zoopolis\n(2011), this macro dimension of agency is described more explicitly in\npolitical terms, referring to a capacity for political participation.\nTo the extent that individuals act in ways that can be construed as\nexpressing approval, acquiescence or dissent with the laws and\nregulations that affect them, they can be described as acting\npolitically and as displaying a form of democratic agency.\n\nThe absence of linguistic agency creates specific challenges since\nboth individuals with deep cognitive disability and domestic animals\nare \u201cdependent on others to support and interpret their\nparticipation\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2016, 176). They can be\nagents only with the help of others, who have discursive rationality,\nand with whom they share relations of trust. The latter can help\nstructure or \u201cscaffold\u201d meaningful choices for the former\nand interpret their expressions.\n\nAccepting that instances of \u201cdependent agency\u201d can count\nas political participation supposes that we abandon the binary between\nindependent and dependent forms of agency as well as the belief that\nonly the former counts as the right kind of agency when it comes to\ncitizenship. This should not be too difficult to do if we are willing\nto recognize that \u201c[w]e are all interdependent, relying on\nothers to enable and sustain our (variable and contextual) capacities\nfor agency\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011, 107). This is not to\nclaim that we are all the same, but to argue in favour of replacing\nthe binary between \u201can autonomous, rational agent\u201d and\n\u201chis or her opposite, the \u2018disabled\u2019\u201d\n\u201cwith a gradient scale in which we are all in various ways and\nin different degrees both dependent on others and independent\u201d\n(Arneil 2009, 234).\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka\u2019s argument becomes less convincing when\nthey attempt to illustrate with concrete examples what they mean by\nthe political participation of domestic animals. In some of the\nexamples they use, the humans involved appear as the real agents of\nthe actions described while animals come across as the objects of\ntheir masters\u2019 agency (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2011,\n112\u2013116; Hinchcliffe 2015). In response to this criticism,\nDonaldson and Kymlicka have conceded the weakness of some of their\nexamples while maintaining the possibility of finding better ones.\nMore interestingly for our purposes, they insist that:\n\u201ccapacities for agency are embedded in ongoing social relations\namongst responsive, reflexive, and interdependent selves, not located\nin a threshold individual capacity for rational reflection and public\ndeliberation\u201d (Donaldson and Kymlicka 2015, 331). If we accept\nthat people with deep cognitive disability and domestic animals are\nmembers of society, then the right question to ask is not whether they\nmeet the threshold condition of discursive rationality and can be\nrecognized as citizens. We should rather enquire about the kind of\nspaces in which their political agency could be expressed as well as\nlook for the mechanisms through which their citizenship could be\nenacted. In short, instead of defining who can be a citizen according\nto whether or not an individual or group can function in the existing\nspaces of citizenship (i.e. whether they can participate in elections\nor militate for political parties), we should create distinct spaces\nthat are commensurate to the capacities of all those who possess\nrights of\n citizenship.[29]\n\nDonaldson and Kymlicka\u2019s main objective is to secure the rights\nof animals against the terrible and unjust consequences of human\nbeings\u2019 lordship over them. From the perspective of democratic\ntheory, the upshot of their argument is mixed. On the one hand, it may\noffer a promising response to the persisting complaints about the\nalleged incompetence of \u2018ordinary\u2019 citizens in\ncontemporary mass democracies (Brennan 2016) by stimulating our\ninstitutional imagination to create better spaces of citizenship for\neveryone. On the other hand, extending the definitions of political\nparticipation and democratic agency to cover the actions of domestic\nanimals may also weaken the very significance of democratic\ncitizenship. Perhaps more importantly, they highlight an abiding\ntension in democratic theory between two models of citizenship: the\nmembership model, where citizenship is defined in terms of social\nmembership, and what they call the \u201ccapacity contract\u201d, in\nwhich citizenship is defined in terms of \u201ccapacities for\nparticular kinds of agency\u201d (Kymlicka and Donaldson 2018,\n161).\n",
