    "main_text": "Mohist Views on Logic and Language || Basic Logical Notions\n3.1 Basic Logical Notions\n\nA great deal of scholarship on Mohist logic in the past 50 years has\nbeen devoted to explicating Mohist texts with the purpose of\nidentifying basic similarities with Western logical notions or\nprinciples (e.g., Zong 2000), or arguing that among the Mohists\u2019\nbasic aims was a program for developing a formal theoretical apparatus\ncomparable to, say, Aristotle\u2019s categorical logic or the\nelementary propositional logic of the Stoics (e.g, Zhang and Liu\n2007). Alternatively, it has been claimed that embodied in the\nMohists\u2019 account of disputation (bian) was in fact a\ntheory of logical analysis motivated by a desire to deduce particular,\ninformative statements about the world from general propositions\n(Harbsmeier 1998). According to Harbsmeier, \u201cThe aim of logical\nanalysis was to establish a correct description of the\nworld\u201d.\n\nIn spite of textual errors and incompleteness, there is no dearth of\nmaterial in Mohist texts that is highly suggestive of these\nsimilarities. In developing their views on disputation from its\nlogical roots, the Mohists appear to have made conscientious and\nregular use of logical operators that are commonly found in\ntoday\u2019s propositional calculi, including conjunction\n(yu), disjunction (ruo), a variety of articles and\nverbs for negation (e.g., wu, fei, bu), and\nimplication (variously indicated with ze, ran hou,\nand other devices). They gave special attention to quantificational\nnotions, taking \u201cno\u201d or \u201cnone\u201d (mo)\nas a primitive (or undefined) notion and in A43 defining\n\u201call\u201d (jin) in terms of it: \u201cAll is none\nnot being so\u201d or, in modern notation, \\(\\forall x\\varphi\\\n=_{\\mathit{df}}\\ \\mathrm{N}x\\mathord{\\sim}\\varphi\\). Furthermore, in\ntheir Greater Selection (Da Qu), they use\n\u201call\u201d to define \u201csome\u201d: \u201cSome is not\nall\u201d (NO5), quite possibly with the definition\n\\(\\exists x\\varphi\\ =_{\\mathit{df}}\\ \\mathord{\\sim}\\forall\nx\\mathord{\\sim}\\varphi \\) in mind (although textual incompleteness\nwarrants caution on this point; Robins 2010 translates it as\n\u201cSome is not exhaustive\u201d). They employed special terms for\nmodality, using bi (necessity), for example, as an adverbial\nrelation between two things, where one can be said to be the necessary\ncomplement of another (e.g., elder brother and younger brother). And\nsome scholars have suggested that the Mohists took steps toward\nformalizing their logical views by conscientiously employing variables\nand other devices that are capable of functioning in the same\ngrammatical role, such as indefinite and demonstrative pronouns (e.g.,\nLiu and Zhang 2010). These views are plausible, but support for them\nis hampered by the fact that the texts do not present them in an\norganized fashion, but mention them variously in passing as other\nviews more central to their theoretical program are developed.\n",
