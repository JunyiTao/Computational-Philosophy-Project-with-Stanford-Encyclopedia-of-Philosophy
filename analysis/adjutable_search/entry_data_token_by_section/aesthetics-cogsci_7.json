The Aesthetics of Literature and Literary Language\n\nThrough the latter part of the twentieth century, theoretical and\ninterpretive studies of literature have been somewhat hostile to both\ncognitive and aesthetic inquiry, often thought of as irrelevant to\nserious interpretive work and a distraction from favoured political\nagendas. Cognitive studies of literature have developed somewhat in\nthe last twenty years but remain a minority enterprise (Hartner 2017).\nOne question of long standing that has concerned scholars in\npsychology, literary studies and aesthetics is the idea that we learn\nfrom literature about the world beyond the text, an idea treated with\nsome suspicion by those influenced by deconstructive or post-modern\ntheorising, who argue that such ambitions depend on failing to realise\nthat characters of fiction are not, and are not like, real people\n(Cixous 1974). Others argue that such cognitive benefits, if they\nexist, are not aesthetically relevant (Lamarque & Olsen 1994: ch.\n17; for criticism see Gaut 2007: ch. 7; Currie 2020: \u00a79.6). There\nis, however, a strong tendency to suppose that the artistic merit of,\nsay, a Shakespearean drama depends in part on our sense that it is\nrevelatory of deep insights into the human condition. Similar claims\nare made for other arts; contemplating van Gogh\u2019s lithograph\nSorrow Kendall Walton notes responding imaginatively to the\nwoman in ways that \u201cgain for me an understanding of what a\nparticular sorrow is like\u201d (2008: 78).\n\nRecently efforts have been made to test the idea that literature does,\non occasion, provide cognitive benefits. It has been claimed that\nexposure to fiction\u2014even single episodes of\nreading\u2014measurably improves empathy and theory of mind (Kidd\n& Castano 2013); the effects, if real, seem to be small and the\nclaimed results have been hard to replicate (Panero et al. 2016; Kidd\n& Castano 2019). Other work in this growing field also does not\npoint in a single direction. Some studies suggest that fiction has a\ncapacity to improve aspects of social cognition (Calarco et al. 2017;\nMar 2018a,b) while others find no such effect (e.g., Wimmer et al.\n2021a, b; see Currie 2020; chs 9\u201311 for general discussion).\nHumanistic scholars who claim educative effects for fiction may\nrespond that these effects are slow and cumulative, and unlikely to be\nvisible in studies of single episodes of reading; testing such claims\nwill be difficult. But their claims are, nonetheless, empirical.\n\nAmong other examples of the cognitive study of literature are\ninvestigations of emotional responses. While aestheticians have tended\nto focus on the apparently \u201cparadoxical\u201d aspects of our\nemotional responses to fictions (for example why we are emotionally\naffected by the non-existent, see above\n Section 7),\n researchers in the cognitive sciences has begun a broader attempt to\nunderstand the role of emotions of all kinds in generating and\nmaintaining interest in narrative and poetry (Menninghaus, Wagner,\nWassiliwizky, et al. 2017); Jenefer Robinson\u2019s (2005) is an\nexample of work from within aesthetics that takes up this broader\nambition while being strongly informed by empirical work. More\nrecently, Kukkonen (2020) attempts an alignment between the\nexpectations of a reader sometimes surprised by plot development and\nthe predictive processing approach to perception and cognition (see\nabove\n Section 3).\n It is an open question whether the predictive processing account\nsheds aesthetically relevant light on the reader\u2019s experience\nrather than simply providing an account of the mechanisms involved\n(see above\n Section 4).\n\nA striking example of an area long thought of as resistant to theory\nfrom outside the domain of art and the aesthetic is that of literary\nlanguage. Insight into the kind of language we think of as distinctive\nof poetry, drama and the novel has traditionally been sought from\nthose whose expertise is literature itself rather than from those\ndeveloping general theories of communication, a view endorsed by Peter\nLamarque, who regards the idea that there is value in seeing literary\nworks as akin to quotidian genres of utterance such as letter-writing\nor political speech making as \u201cutterly misconceived\u201d\n(Lamarque 2007: 34). But advocates of relevance theory, a\nnaturalistically inclined development of Gricean pragmatics, reject\nthe idea that there is anything fundamentally special or autonomous\nabout literary language, claiming that\n\n\nstylistic and poetic effects traditionally associated with figurative\nutterances arise naturally in the pursuit of relevance, and call for\nno special treatment not required for the interpretation of ordinary\nliteral utterances. (D. Wilson 2018: 191)\n\n\n(for work that seeks empirical confirmation for relevance theory see,\ne.g., Happe 1993; Sperber & Wilson 2002; van der Henst, Carles,\n& Sperber 2002; Noveck & Posada 2003; and van der Henst &\nSperber 2004).\n\nOne ambition of relevance theory is to encourage us to see\n\u201cpoetic uses\u201d of language, where an idea is very\nindirectly suggested by the words used, as less marginal than we would\nif we thought of the paradigm of communication as the case where an\nagent utters a sentence that means exactly what the speaker wishes to\ncommunicate. Relevance theorists say that such cases of literal\nmeaning are rare or non-existent and do not constitute any kind of\ncommunicative ideal. They point to the widespread phenomenon of\n\u201cweak implicature\u201d: audiences draw a range of conclusions\nfrom an utterance, some of them obviously intended but others harder\nto identify as intended (Sperber & Wilson 1995: 197\u20139). On\nthis view the totality of what is meant, even in mundane cases, is\nnever more than vaguely specifiable and would, if we bothered to\ninvestigate, be subject to the same unresolvable disputes as we find\nin poetic criticism. It need not be concluded that poetic discourse is\nentirely of a piece with over-the-garden-wall conversation; the\nrelevance theorist\u2019s point is that the differences are ones of\ndegree and not of kind.\n",
