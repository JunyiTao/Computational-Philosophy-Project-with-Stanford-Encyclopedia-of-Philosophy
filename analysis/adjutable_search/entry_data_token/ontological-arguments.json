In\nother words, ontological arguments are arguments from what are\ntypically alleged to be none but analytic, a priori and\nnecessary premises to the conclusion that God exists. \n\nThe first, and best-known, ontological argument was proposed by St.\nAnselm of Canterbury in the 11th century C.E. In his\nProslogion, St. Anselm claims to derive the existence of God\nfrom the concept of a being than which no greater can be\nconceived. St. Anselm reasoned that, if such a being fails to\nexist, then a greater being\u2014namely, a being than which no\ngreater can be conceived, and which exists\u2014can be\nconceived. But this would be absurd: nothing can be greater than a\nbeing than which no greater can be conceived. So a being than which no\ngreater can be conceived\u2014i.e., God\u2014exists.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Ren\u00e9 Descartes defended a family of\nsimilar arguments. For instance, in the Fifth Meditation,\nDescartes claims to provide a proof demonstrating the existence of God\nfrom the idea of a supremely perfect being. Descartes argues that\nthere is no less contradiction in conceiving a supremely perfect being\nwho lacks existence than there is in conceiving a triangle whose\ninterior angles do not sum to 180 degrees. Hence, he supposes, since\nwe do conceive a supremely perfect being\u2014we do have the idea of\na supremely perfect being\u2014we must conclude that a supremely\nperfect being exists.\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, Gottfried Leibniz attempted to fill\nwhat he took to be a shortcoming in Descartes\u2019 view. According\nto Leibniz, Descartes\u2019 arguments fail unless one first shows\nthat the idea of a supremely perfect being is coherent, or that it is\npossible for there to be a supremely perfect being. Leibniz argued\nthat, since perfections are unanalysable, it is impossible to\ndemonstrate that perfections are incompatible\u2014and he concluded\nfrom this that all perfections can co-exist together in a single\nentity.\n\nIn more recent times, Kurt G\u00f6del, Charles Hartshorne, Norman\nMalcolm and Alvin Plantinga have all presented much-discussed\nontological arguments which bear interesting connections to the\nearlier arguments of St. Anselm, Descartes and Leibniz. Of these, the\nmost interesting are those of G\u00f6del and Plantinga; in these\ncases, however, it is unclear whether we should really say that these\nauthors claim that the arguments are proofs of the existence\nof God.\n\nCritiques of ontological arguments begin with Gaunilo, a contemporary\nof St. Anselm. Perhaps the best known criticisms of ontological\narguments are due to Immanuel Kant, in his Critique of Pure\nReason. Most famously, Kant claims that ontological arguments are\nvitiated by their reliance upon the implicit assumption that\n\u201cexistence\u201d is a real predicate. However, as Bertrand Russell\nobserved, it is much easier to be persuaded that ontological arguments\nare no good than it is to say exactly what is wrong with them. This\nhelps to explain why ontological arguments have fascinated\nphilosophers for almost a thousand years.\n\nIn various ways, the account provided to this point is rough, and\nsusceptible of improvement. Sections 1\u20136 in what follows provide\nsome of the requisite embellishments, though\u2014as is usually the\ncase in philosophy\u2014there are many issues taken up here which\ncould be pursued at much greater length. Sections 7\u20139 take up\nsome of the central questions at a slightly more sophisticated level\nof discussion. Section 10 is a quick overview of very recent work on\nontological arguments:\n", "toc": [{"#HisOntArg": "1. History of Ontological Arguments"}, {"#TaxOntArg": "2.

Taxonomy of Ontological Arguments\n\nAccording to a modification of the taxonomy of Oppy 1995, there are\neight major kinds of ontological arguments, viz: \n\ndefinitional ontological arguments;\nconceptual (or hyperintensional) ontological arguments;\nmodal ontological arguments;\nMeinongian ontological arguments;\nexperiential ontological arguments;\nmereological ontological arguments;\nhigher-order ontological arguments; and\n\u2018Hegelian\u2019 ontological arguments;\n\n\nExamples of all but the last follow. These are mostly toy examples.\nBut they serve to highlight the deficiencies which more complex\nexamples also share.\n\nNote: No example is provided of a \u2018Hegelian\u2019 ontological\nargument. There is no extant discussion that states clearly the full\nset of premises of a \u2018Hegelian\u2019 ontological argument. (See\nRedding and Bubbio 2014 for recent discussion of this point.)\n\nGod is a being which has every perfection. (This is true as a matter\nof definition.) Existence is a perfection. Hence God exists.\nI conceive of a being than which no greater can be conceived. If a\nbeing than which no greater can be conceived does not exist, then I\ncan conceive of a being greater than a being than which no greater can\nbe conceived\u2014namely, a being than which no greater can be\nconceived that exists. I cannot conceive of a being greater than a\nbeing than which no greater can be conceived. Hence, a being than\nwhich no greater can be conceived exists.\nIt is possible that that God exists. God is not a contingent being,\ni.e., either it is not possible that God exists, or it is necessary\nthat God exists. Hence, it is necessary that God exists. Hence, God\nexists. (See Malcolm 1960, Hartshorne 1965, and Plantinga 1974 for\nclosely related arguments.)\n[It is analytic, necessary and a priori that] Each instance of the\nschema \u201cThe F G is F\u201d expresses a truth.\nHence the sentence \u201cThe existent perfect being is\nexistent\u201d expresses a truth. Hence, the existent perfect being\nis existent. Hence, God is existent, i.e. God exists. (The last step\nis justified by the observation that, as a matter of definition, if\nthere is exactly one existent perfect being, then that being is\nGod.)\nThe word \u2018God\u2019 has a meaning that is revealed in religious\nexperience. The word \u2018God\u2019 has a meaning only if God\nexists. Hence, God exists. (See Rescher 1959 for a live version of\nthis argument.)\nI exist. Therefore something exists. Whenever a bunch of things exist,\ntheir mereological sum also exists. Therefore the sum of all things\nexists. Therefore God\u2014the sum of all\nthings\u2014exists.\nSay that a God-property is a property that is possessed by God in all\nand only those worlds in which God exists. Not all properties are God\nproperties. Any property entailed by a collection of God-properties is\nitself a God-property. The God-properties include necessary existence,\nnecessary omnipotence, necessary omniscience, and necessary perfect\ngoodness. Hence, there is a necessarily existent, necessarily\nomnipotent, necessarily omniscient, and necessarily perfectly good\nbeing (namely, God).\n\n\nOf course, this taxonomy is not exclusive: an argument can belong to\nseveral categories at once. Moreover, an argument can be ambiguous\nbetween a range of readings, each of which belongs to different\ncategories. This latter fact may help to explain part of the curious\nfascination of ontological arguments. Finally, the taxonomy can be\nfurther specialised: there are, for example, at least four importantly\ndifferent kinds of modal ontological arguments which should be\ndistinguished. (See, e.g., Ross 1969 for a rather different kind of\nmodal ontological argument.)\n3. Characterisation of Ontological Arguments\n\nIt is not easy to give a good characterisation of ontological\narguments. The traditional characterisation involves the use of\nproblematic notions\u2014analyticity, necessity, and a\npriority\u2014and also fails to apply to many arguments to which\ndefenders have affixed the label \u201contological\u201d. (Consider,\nfor example, the claim that I conceive of a being than which no\ngreater can be conceived. This claim is clearly not analytic (its\ntruth doesn\u2019t follow immediately from the meanings of the words\nused to express it), nor necessary (I might never have entertained the\nconcept), nor a priori (except perhaps in my own case, though\neven this is unclear\u2014perhaps even I don\u2019t know\nindependently of experience that I have this concept.)) However, it is\nunclear how that traditional characterisation should be improved upon.\n\n\nPerhaps one might resolve to use the label \u201contological\nargument\u201d for any argument which gets classified as \u201can\nontological argument\u201d by its proponent(s). This procedure would\nmake good sense if one thought that there is a natural\nkind\u2014ontological arguments\u2014which our practice carves out,\nbut for which is hard to specify defining conditions. Moreover, this\nprocedure can be adapted as a pro tem stop gap: when there is\na better definition to hand, that definition will be adopted instead.\nOn the other hand, it seems worthwhile to attempt a more informative\ndefinition.\n\nFocus on the case of ontological arguments for the conclusion that God\nexists. One characteristic feature of these arguments is the use which\nthey make of \u201creferential vocabulary\u201d\u2014names,\ndefinite descriptions, indefinite descriptions, quantified noun\nphrases, etc.\u2014whose ontological commitments\u2014for\noccurrences of this vocabulary in \u201creferential\nposition\u201d\u2014non-theists do not accept.\n\nTheists and non-theists alike (can) agree that there is\nspatio-temporal, or causal, or nomic, or modal structure to the world\n(the basis for cosmological arguments); and that there are certain\nkinds of complexity of organisation, structure and function in the\nworld (the basis for teleological arguments); and so on. But theists\nand non-theists are in dispute about whether there are perfect beings,\nor beings than which no greater can be conceived, or \u2026\u00a0;\nthus, theists and non-theists are in dispute about the\nindirect subject matter of the premises of ontological\narguments.\n\nOf course, the premises of ontological arguments often do not deal\ndirectly with perfect beings, beings than which no greater can be\nconceived, etc.; rather, they deal with descriptions of, or ideas of,\nor concepts of, or the possibility of the existence of, these things.\nHowever, the basic point remains: ontological arguments require the\nuse of vocabulary which non-theists should certainly find problematic\nwhen it is used in ontologically committing contexts (i.e not inside\nthe scope of prophylactic operators\u2014such as \u201caccording to\nthe story\u201d or \u201cby the lights of theists\u201d or\n\u201cby the definition\u201d\u2014which can be taken to afford\nprotection against unwanted commitments).\n\nNote that this characterisation does not beg the question against the\npossibility of the construction of a successful ontological\nargument\u2014i.e., it does not lead immediately to the conclusion\nthat all ontological arguments are question-begging (in virtue of the\nontologically committing vocabulary which they employ). For it may be\nthat the vocabulary in question only gets used in premises under the\nprotection of prophylactic operators (which ward off the unwanted\ncommitments.) Of course, there will then be questions about whether\nthe resulting arguments can possibly be valid\u2014how could the\ncommitments turn up in the conclusion if they are not there in the\npremises?\u2014but those are further questions, which would remain to\nbe addressed.\n4. Uses of Ontological Arguments\n\nBefore we turn to assessment of ontological arguments, we need to get\nclear about what the proper intended goals of ontological arguments\ncan be. Suppose we think of arguments as having advocates and targets:\nwhen an advocate presents an argument to a target, the goal of the\nadvocate is to bring about some change in the target. What might be\nthe targets of ontological arguments, and what might be the changes\nthat advocates of these arguments aim to bring about in those targets?\n\n\nHere are some proposals; no doubt the reader can think of others: \n\nThe targets might be atheists, and the goal might be to turn them\ninto theists. \nThe targets might be agnostics, and the goal might be to turn them\ninto theists. \nThe targets might be theists, and the goal might be to improve the\ndoxastic position of theists. \nThe targets might be professional philosophers, and the goal might\nbe to advance understanding of the consequences of adopting particular\nlogical rules, or treating existence as a real predicate, or allowing\ndefinitions to have existential import, or the like. \nThe targets might be undergraduate philosophy students, and the\ngoal might be to give them some sufficiently frustrating examples on\nwhich to cut their critical teeth. \n\n\nIn the coming discussion, it will be supposed that the targets are\natheists and agnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into\ntheists. Suppose that an advocate presents an ontological argument to\na target. What conditions must that arguments satisfy if it is fit for\nits intended purpose? A plausible suggestion is that, minimally, it\nshould make the targets recognise that they have good reason to accept\nthe conclusion of the argument that they did not recognise that they\nhave prior to the presentation of the argument. Adopting this\nplausible suggestion provides the following criterion: a successful\nontological argument is one that should make atheists and agnostics\nrecognise that they have good reason to believe that God exists that\nthey did not recognise that they have prior to the presentation of the\nargument. Note that this criterion has a normative dimension: it\nadverts to what atheists and agnostics should do when presented with\nthe argument. \n\nThere is an important discussion to be had about whether we should\nsuppose that the targets of ontological arguments are atheists and\nagnostics, and that the goal is to turn them into theists. However, it\nis simply beyond the scope of this entry to pursue that discussion\nhere. \n5. Objections to Ontological Arguments\n\nObjections to ontological arguments take many forms. Some objections\nare intended to apply only to particular ontological arguments, or\nparticular forms of ontological arguments; other objections are\nintended to apply to all ontological arguments. It is a controversial\nquestion whether there are any successful general objections to\nontological arguments. \n\nOne general criticism of ontological arguments which have appeared\nhitherto is this: none of them is persuasive, i.e., none of\nthem provides those who do not already accept the conclusion that God\nexists\u2014and who are reasonable, reflective, well-informed,\netc.\u2014with either a pro tanto reason or an\nall-things-considered reason to accept that conclusion. Any reading of\nany ontological argument which has been produced so far which is\nsufficiently clearly stated to admit of evaluation yields a result\nwhich is invalid, or possesses a set of premises which it is clear in\nadvance that no reasonable, reflective, well-informed, etc.\nnon-theists will accept, or has a benign conclusion which has no\nreligious significance, or else falls prey to more than one of the\nabove failings.\n\nFor each of the families of arguments introduced in the earlier\ntaxonomy, we can give general reasons why arguments of that family\nfall under the general criticism. In what follows, we shall apply\nthese general considerations to the exemplar arguments introduced in\nsection 2.\n\n(1) Definitional arguments: These are arguments in which ontologically\ncommitting vocabulary is introduced solely via a definition. An\nobvious problem is that claims involving that vocabulary cannot then\nbe non-question-beggingly detached from the scope of that definition.\n(The inference from \u2018By definition, God is an existent\nbeing\u2019 to \u2018God exists\u2019 is patently invalid; while\nthe inference to \u2018By definition, God exists\u2019 is valid, but\nuninteresting. In the example given earlier, the premises license the\nclaim that, as a matter of definition, God possesses the perfection of\nexistence. But, as just noted, there is no valid inference from this\nclaim to the further claim that God exists.)\n\n(2) Conceptual arguments: These are arguments in which ontologically\ncommitting vocabulary is introduced solely within the scope of\nhyperintensional operators (e.g. \u2018believes that\u2019,\n\u2018conceives of\u2019, etc.). Often, these operators have two\nreadings, one of which can cancel ontological commitment, and the\nother of which cannot. On the reading which can give cancellation (as\nin the most likely reading of \u2018John believes in Santa\nClaus\u2019), the inference to a conclusion in which the ontological\ncommitment is not cancelled will be invalid. On the reading which\ncannot cancel ontological commitment (as in that reading of\n\u2018John thinks about God\u2019 which can only be true if there is\na God to think about), the premises are question-begging: they incur\nontological commitments which non-theists reject. In our sample\nargument, the claim, that I conceive of an existent being than which\nno greater being can be conceived, admits of the two kinds of readings\njust distinguished. On the one hand, on the reading which gives\ncancellation, the inference to the conclusion that there is a being\nthan which no greater can be conceived is plainly invalid. On the\nother hand, on the reading in which there is no cancellation, it is\nclear that this claim is one which no reasonable, etc. non-theist will\naccept: if you doubt that there is a being than which no greater can\nbe conceived, then, of course, you doubt whether you can have thoughts\nabout such a being.\n\n(3) Modal arguments: These are arguments with premises which concern\nmodal claims about God, i.e., claims about the possibility or\nnecessity of God\u2019s attributes and existence. Suppose that we\nagree to think about possibility and necessity in terms of possible\nworlds: a claim is possibly true just in case it is true in at least\none possible world; a claim is necessarily true just in case it is\ntrue in every possible world; and a claim is contingent just in case\nit is true in some possible worlds and false in others. Some theists\nhold that God is a necessarily existent being, i.e., that God exists\nin every possible world; all non-theists reject the claim that God\nexists in the actual world. The sample argument consists, in effect,\nof two premises:\n\nGod exists in at least one possible world.\nGod exists in all possible worlds if God exists in any.\n\n\nA minimally rational non-theist cannot accept both of these premises\n\u2013 they entail that God exists in every possible world whereas a\nminimally rational non-theist maintains that there is at least one\npossible world in which God does not exist. Given that a minimally\nrational non-theist says that there is at least one possible world in\nwhich God does not exist, such a non-theist can offer a parallel\ncounterargument with the following two premises:\n\nGod fails to exist in at least one possible world.\nGod exists in all possible worlds if God exists in any.\n\n\nThese premises entail that God exists in no possible world, and hence\nthat God does not exist in the actual world. Considered together, the\nargument and the counterargument just mentioned plainly do not give\nanyone a reason to prefer theism to non-theism, and nor do they give\nanyone a reason to prefer non-theism to theism. So the sample argument\nis unsuccessful: it doesn\u2019t supply an all-things-considered\nreason to prefer theism to non-theism (just as the counterargument\ndoesn\u2019t supply an all-things-considered reason to prefer\nnon-theism to theism).\n\n(4) Meinongian arguments: These are arguments which depend somehow or\nother on Meinongian theories of objects. Consider the schema\n\u2018The F G is F\u2019. Naive Meinongians will\nsuppose that if F is instantiated with any property, then the\nresult is true (and, quite likely, necessary, analytic and a priori).\nSo, for example, the round square is round; the bald current King of\nFrance is bald; and so on. However, more sophisticated Meinongians\nwill insist that there must be some restriction on the substitution\ninstances for F, in order to allow one to draw the obvious and\nimportant ontological distinction between the following two groups:\n{Bill Clinton, the sun, the Eiffel Tower} and {Santa Claus, Mickey\nMouse, the round square}. Choice of vocabulary here is controversial:\nLet us suppose (for the sake of example) that the right thing to say\nis that the former things exist and the latter do not. Under this\nsupposition, \u2018existent\u2019 will not be a suitable\nsubstitution instance for F\u2014obviously, since we all agree that\nthere is no existent round square. Of course, nothing hangs on the\nchoice of \u2018existent\u2019 as the crucial piece of vocabulary.\nThe point is that non-theists are not prepared to include god(s) in\nthe former group of objects\u2014and hence will be unpersuaded by any\nargument which tries to use whatever vocabulary is used to\ndiscriminate between the two classes as the basis for an argument that\ngod(s) belong to the former group. (Cognoscenti will recognise that\nthe crucial point is that Meinongian ontological arguments fail to\nrespect the distinction between nuclear (assumptible, characterising)\nproperties and non-nuclear (non-assumptible, non-characterising)\nproperties. It should, of course, be noted that neither Meinong, nor\nany of his well-known modern supporters\u2014e.g. Terence Parsons,\nRichard Sylvan\u2014ever endorses a Meinongian ontological argument;\nand it should also be noted that most motivate the distinction between\nnuclear and non-nuclear properties in part by a need to avoid\nMeinongian ontological arguments. The reason for calling these\narguments \u201cMeinongian\u201d is that they rely on quantification\nover\u2014or reference to\u2014non-existent objects; there is no\npejorative intent in the use of this label.)\n\n(5) Experiential arguments: These are arguments which try to make use\nof \u2018externalist\u2019 or \u2018object-involving\u2019\naccounts of content. It should not be surprising that they fail. After\nall, those accounts of content need to have something to say about\nexpressions which fail to refer (\u2018Santa Claus\u2019,\n\u2018phlogiston\u2019, etc.). But, however the account goes,\nnon-theists will insist that expressions which purport to refer to\ngod(s) should be given exactly the same kind of treatment.\n\n(6) Mereological arguments: Those who dislike mereology will not be\nimpressed by these arguments. However, even those who accept\nprinciples of unrestricted composition\u2014i.e., who accept\nprinciples which claim, e.g., that, whenever there are some things,\nthere is something which is the sum or fusion of all of those\nthings\u2014need not be perturbed by them: for it is plausible to\nthink that the conclusions of these arguments have no religious\nsignificance whatsoever\u2014they are merely arguments for, e.g., the\nexistence of the physical universe.\n\n(7) Higher-Order arguments: The key to these arguments is the\nobservation that any collection of properties, that (a) does not\ninclude all properties and (b) is closed under entailment, is possibly\njointly instantiated. If it is impossible that God exists \u2014 as\nall who deny that God exists suppose, on the further assumption that,\nwere God to exist, God would exist of necessity \u2014 then it cannot\nbe true both that the God-properties are closed under entailment and\nthat there are properties that are not God-properties. Those who take\nthemselves to have good independent reason to deny that there are any\ngods will take themselves to have good independent reason to deny that\nthere are God-properties that form a non-trivial collection that is\nclosed under entailment.\n\nEven if the forgoing analyses are correct, it is important to note\nthat no argument has been given for the conclusion that no ontological\nargument can be successful. Even if all of the kinds of\narguments produced to date are pretty clearly unsuccessful\u2014i.e.,\nnot such as ought to give non-theists reason to accept the conclusion\nthat God exists\u2014it remains an open question whether there is\nsome other kind of hitherto undiscovered ontological argument which\ndoes succeed. (Perhaps it is worth adding here that there is fairly\nwidespread consensus, even amongst theists, that no known ontological\narguments for the existence of God are persuasive. Most categories of\nontological argument have some actual defenders; but none has a large\nfollowing.)\n\nMany other objections to (some) ontological arguments have been\nproposed. All of the following have been alleged to be the key to the\nexplanation of the failure of (at least some) ontological arguments:\n(1) existence is not a predicate (see, e.g., Kant, Smart 1955, Alston\n1960); (2) the concept of god is meaningless/incoherent/ inconsistent\n(see, e.g., Findlay 1949); (3) ontological arguments are ruled out by\n\u201cthe missing explanation argument\u201d (see Johnston 1992; (4)\nontological arguments all trade on mistaken uses of singular terms\n(see, e.g., Barnes 1972; (5) existence is not a perfection (see almost\nany textbook in philosophy of religion); (6) ontological arguments\npresuppose a Meinongian approach to ontology (see, e.g., Dummett\n1993); and (7) ontological arguments are question-begging, i.e.,\npresuppose what they set out to prove (see, e.g., Rowe 1989). There\nare many things to say about these objections: the most important\npoint is that almost all of them require far more controversial\nassumptions than non-theists require in order to be able to reject\nontological arguments with good conscience. Trying to support most of\nthese claims merely in order to beat up on ontological arguments is\nlike using a steamroller to crack a nut (in circumstances in which one\nis unsure that one can get the steamroller to move!).\n\nOf course, all of the above discussion is directed merely to the claim\nthat ontological arguments are not dialectically\nefficacious\u2014i.e., they give reasonable non-theists no reason to\nchange their views. It might be wondered whether there is some other\nuse which ontological arguments have\u2014e.g., as Plantinga claims,\nin establishing the reasonableness of theism. This seems unlikely.\nAfter all, at best these arguments show that certain sets of sentences\n(beliefs, etc.) are inconsistent\u2014one cannot reject the\nconclusions of these arguments while accepting their premises. But the\narguments themselves say nothing about the reasonableness of accepting\nthe premisses. So the arguments themselves say nothing about the\n(unconditional) reasonableness of accepting the conclusions of these\narguments. Those who are disposed to think that theism is irrational\nneed find nothing in ontological arguments to make them change their\nminds (and those who are disposed to think that theism is true should\ntake no comfort from them either).\n6. Parodies of Ontological Arguments\n\nPositive ontological arguments\u2014i.e., arguments FOR the existence\nof god(s)\u2014invariably admit of various kinds of parodies, i.e.,\nparallel arguments which seem at least equally acceptable to\nnon-theists, but which establish absurd or contradictory conclusions.\nFor many positive ontological arguments, there are parodies which\npurport to establish the non-existence of god(s); and for many\npositive ontological arguments there are lots (usually a large\ninfinity!) of similar arguments which purport to establish the\nexistence of lots (usually a large infinity) of distinct god-like\nbeings. Here are some modest examples: \n\n(1) By definition, God is a non-existent being who has every (other)\nperfection. Hence God does not exist.\n\n(2) I conceive of a being than which no greater can be conceived\nexcept that it only ever creates n universes. If such a being\ndoes not exist, then we can conceive of a greater being\u2014namely,\none exactly like it which does exist. But I cannot conceive of a being\nwhich is greater in this way. Hence, a being than which no greater can\nbe conceived except that it only ever creates n universes\nexists.\n\n(3) It is possible that God does not exist. God is not a contingent\nbeing, i.e., either it is not possible that God exists, or it is\nnecessary that God exists. Hence it is not possible that God exists.\nHence God does not exist.\n\n(4) It is analytic, necessary, and a priori that the F G is\nF. Hence, the existent perfect being who creates exactly\nn universes is existent. Hence the perfect being who creates\nexactly n universes exists.\n\nThere are many kinds of parodies of Ontological Arguments. The aim is\nto construct arguments which non-theists can reasonably claim to have\nno more reason to accept than the original Ontological Arguments\nthemselves. Of course, theists may well be able to hold that the\noriginals are sound, and the parodies not\u2014but that is an\nentirely unrelated issue. (All theists\u2014and no\nnon-theists\u2014should grant that the following argument is sound,\ngiven that the connectives are to be interpreted classically:\n\u201cEither 2+2=5, or God exists. Not 2+2=5. Hence God\nexists.\u201d This argument contributes nothing positive to any case\nfor theism, just as the argument \u201cEither 2+2=5, or God does not\nexist. Not 2+2=5. Hence God does not exist.\u201d contributes nothing\npositive to the case for non-theism.)\n\nThere are many parodic discussions of Ontological Arguments in the\nliterature. See, for example, the parody provided by Raymond Smullyan\n(1984), in which the argument is attributed to \u201cthe unknown\nDutch theologian van Dollard\u201d. A relatively recent addition to\nthe genre is described in Grey 2000, though the date of its\nconstruction is uncertain. It is the work of Douglas Gasking, one-time\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Melbourne (with\nemendations by William Grey and Denis Robinson):\n\nThe creation of the world is the most marvellous achievement\nimaginable.\nThe merit of an achievement is the product of (a) its intrinsic\nquality, and (b) the ability of its creator.\nThe greater the disability or handicap of the creator, the more\nimpressive the achievement.\nThe most formidable handicap for a creator would be\nnon-existence.\nTherefore, if we suppose that the universe is the product of an\nexistent creator, we can conceive a greater being\u2014namely, one\nwho created everything while not existing.\nAn existing God, therefore, would not be a being than which a\ngreater cannot be conceived, because an even more formidable and\nincredible creator would be a God which did not exist.\n(Hence) God does not exist.\n\n\nThis parody\u2014at least in its current state\u2014is inferior to\nother parodies in the literature, including the early parodies of\nGaunilo and Caterus. To mention but one difficulty, while we\nmight suppose that it would be a greater achievement to\ncreate something if one did not exist than if one did exist, it\ndoesn\u2019t follow from this that a non-existent creator is greater\n(qua being) than an existent creator. Perhaps it might be\nreplied that this objection fails to take the first premise into\naccount: if the creation of the world really is \u201cthe most\nmarvellous achievement imaginable\u201d, then surely there is some\nplausibility to the claim that the creator must have been non-existent\n(since that would make the achievement more marvellous than it would\notherwise have been). But what reason is there to believe that the\ncreation of the world is \u201cthe most marvellous achievement\nimaginable\u201d, in the sense which is required for this argument?\nSurely it is quite easy to imagine even more marvellous\nachievements\u2014e.g., the creation of many worlds at least as good\nas this one! (Of course, one might also want to say that, in fact, one\ncannot conceive of a non-existent being\u2019s actually creating\nsomething: that is literally inconceivable. Etc.) \n\nChambers 2000 and Siegwart 2014 provide interesting recent discussions\nof Gaunilo\u2019s parody of the Proslogion II argument.\n7. G\u00f6del\u2019s Ontological Argument\n\nThere is a small, but steadily growing, literature on the ontological\narguments which G\u00f6del developed in his notebooks, but which did\nnot appear in print until well after his death. These arguments have\nbeen discussed, annotated and amended by various leading logicians:\nthe upshot is a family of arguments with impeccable logical\ncredentials. (Interested readers are referred to Sobel 1987, Anderson\n1990, Adams 1995b, and Hazen 1999 for the history of these arguments,\nand for the scholarly annotations and emendations.) Here, we give\na brief presentation of the version of the argument which is developed\nby Anderson, and then make some comments on that version.\nThis discussion follows the presentation and discussion in Oppy 1996,\n2000. \n\nDefinition 1: x is God-like if and only if x has as\nessential properties those and only those properties which are\npositive\n\n\nDefinition 2: A is an essence of x if and only if\nfor every property B, x has B necessarily\nif and only if A entails B\n\nDefinition 3: x necessarily exists if and only if every\nessence of x is necessarily exemplified\n\nAxiom 1: If a property is positive, then its negation is not\npositive.\n\nAxiom 2: Any property entailed by\u2014i.e., strictly implied\nby\u2014a positive property is positive\n\nAxiom 3: The property of being God-like is positive\n\nAxiom 4: If a property is positive, then it is necessarily\npositive\n\nAxiom 5: Necessary existence is positive\n\nAxiom 6: For any property P, if P is positive, then\nbeing necessarily P is positive.\n\nTheorem 1: If a property is positive, then it is consistent, i.e.,\npossibly exemplified.\n\nCorollary 1: The property of being God-like is consistent.\n\nTheorem 2: If something is God-like, then the property of being\nGod-like is an essence of that thing.\n\nTheorem 3: Necessarily, the property of being God-like is\nexemplified.\n\n\nGiven a sufficiently generous conception of properties, and granted\nthe acceptability of the underlying modal logic, the listed theorems\ndo follow from the axioms. (This point was argued in detail by Dana\nScott, in lecture notes which circulated for many years and which were\ntranscribed in Sobel 1987 and published in Sobel 2004. It is also made\nby Sobel, Anderson, and Adams.) So, criticisms of the argument are\nbound to focus on the axioms, or on the other assumptions which are\nrequired in order to construct the proof.\n\nSome philosophers have denied the acceptability of the underlying\nmodal logic. And some philosophers have rejected generous conceptions\nof properties in favour of sparse conceptions according to which only\nsome predicates express properties. But suppose that we adopt neither\nof these avenues of potential criticism of the proof. What else might\nwe say against it?\n\nOne important point to note is that no definition of the\nnotion of \u201cpositive property\u201d is supplied with the proof.\nAt most, the various axioms which involve this concept can be taken to\nprovide a partial implicit definition. If we suppose that the\n\u201cpositive properties\u201d form a set, then the axioms provide\nus with the following information about this set:\n\nIf a property belongs to the set, then its negation does not\nbelong to the set.\nThe set is closed under entailment.\nThe property of having as essential properties just those\nproperties which are in the set is itself a member of the set.\nThe set has exactly the same members in all possible worlds.\nThe property of necessary existence is in the set.\nIf a property is in the set, then the property of having that\nproperty necessarily is also in the set.\n\n\nOn G\u00f6del\u2019s theoretical assumptions, we can show that\nany set which conforms to (1)\u2013(6) is such that the\nproperty of having as essential properties just those properties which\nare in that set is exemplified. G\u00f6del wants us to\nconclude that there is just one intuitive, theologically interesting\nset of properties which is such that the property of having as\nessential properties just the properties in that set is exemplified.\nBut, on the one hand, what reason do we have to think that there is\nany theologically interesting set of properties which\nconforms to the G\u00f6delian specification? And, on the other hand,\nwhat reason do we have to deny that, if there is one set of\ntheologically interesting set of properties which conforms to the\nG\u00f6delian specification, then there are many theologically\nthreatening sets of properties which also conform to that\nspecification?\n\nIn particular, there is some reason to think that the G\u00f6delian\nontological argument goes through just as well\u2014or just as\nbadly\u2014with respect to other sets of properties (and in ways\nwhich are damaging to the original argument). Suppose that there is\nsome set of independent properties {I,\nG1, G2, \u2026} which can be\nused to generate the set of positive properties by closure under\nentailment and \u201cnecessitation\u201d.\n(\u201cIndependence\u201d means: no one of the properties in the set\nis entailed by all the rest. \u201cNecessitation\u201d means: if\nP is in the set, then so is necessarily having P.\nI is the property of having as essential properties just\nthose properties which are in the set. G1,\nG2, \u2026 are further properties, of which we\nrequire at least two.) Consider any proper subset of the set\n{G1, G2,\n\u2026}\u2014{H1, H2,\n\u2026}, say\u2014and define a new generating set {I*,\nH1, H2, \u2026}, where\nI* is the property of having as essential properties just\nthose properties which are in the newly generated set. A\n\u201cproof\u201d parallel to that offered by G\u00f6del\n\u201cestablishes\u201d that there is a being which has as essential\nproperties just those properties in this new set. If there are as few\nas 7 independent properties in the original generating set, then we\nshall be able to establish the existence of 720\ndistinct\u201cGod-like\u201d creatures by the kind of argument which\nG\u00f6del offers. (The creatures are distinct because each has a\ndifferent set of essential properties.)\n\nEven if the above considerations are sufficient to cast doubt on the\ncredentials of G\u00f6del\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d, they do not\npinpoint where the \u201cproof\u201d goes wrong. If we accept that\nthe role of Axioms 1, 2, 4, and 6 is really just to constrain the\nnotion of \u201cpositive property\u201d in the right way\u2014or,\nin other words, if we suppose that Axioms 1, 2, 4, and 6 are\n\u201canalytic truths\u201d about \u201cpositive\nproperties\u201d\u2014then there is good reason for opponents of the\n\u201cproof\u201d to be sceptical about Axioms 3 and 5. Kant would\nnot have been happy with Axiom 5; and there is at least some reason to\nthink that whether the property of being God-like is\n\u201cpositive\u201d ought to depend upon whether or not there is a\nGod-like being.\n\nFor detailed recent discussion of G\u00f6del\u2019s argument, see\nKovac (2003), Pruss (2009) (2018), and Swietorzecka (2016).\n8. A Victorious Ontological Argument?\n\nThe \u201cvictorious\u201d modal ontological argument of Plantinga\n1974 goes roughly as follows: Say that an entity possesses\n\u201cmaximal excellence\u201d if and only if it is omnipotent,\nomniscient, and morally perfect. Say, further, that an entity possesses\n\u201cmaximal greatness\u201d if and only if it possesses maximal\nexcellence in every possible world\u2014that is, if and only if it is\nnecessarily existent and necessarily maximally excellent. Then\nconsider the following argument: \n\nThere is a possible world in which there is an entity which\npossesses maximal greatness.\n(Hence) There is an entity which possesses maximal greatness.\n\n\nUnder suitable assumptions about the nature of accessibility relations\nbetween possible worlds, this argument is valid: from it is possible\nthat it is necessary that p, one can infer that it is\nnecessary that p. Setting aside the possibility that one\nmight challenge this widely accepted modal principle, it seems that\nopponents of the argument are bound to challenge the acceptability of\nthe premise.\n\nAnd, of course, they do. Let\u2019s just run the argument in\nreverse.\n\nThere is no entity which possesses maximal greatness.\n(Hence) There is no possible world in which there is an entity\nwhich possesses maximal greatness.\n\n\nPlainly enough, if you do not already accept the claim that there is\nan entity which possesses maximal greatness, then you won\u2019t\nagree that the first of these arguments is more acceptable than the\nsecond. So, as a proof of the existence of a being which possesses\nmaximal greatness, Plantinga\u2019s argument seems to be a\nnon-starter.\n\nPerhaps somewhat surprisingly, Plantinga himself agrees: the\n\u201cvictorious\u201d modal ontological argument is not a proof of\nthe existence of a being which possesses maximal greatness. But how,\nthen, is it \u201cvictorious\u201d? Plantinga writes: \u201cOur\nverdict on these reformulated versions of St. Anselm\u2019s argument\nmust be as follows. They cannot, perhaps, be said to prove or\nestablish their conclusion. But since it is rational to\naccept their central premise, they do show that it is rational to\naccept that conclusion\u201d (Plantinga 1974, 221).\n\nIt is clear that Plantinga\u2019s argument does not show what he\nclaims that it shows. Consider, again, the argument: \u201cEither God\nexists, or 2+2=5. It is not the case that 2+2=5. So God exists.\u201d\nIt is a mistake for a theist to say: \u201cSince the premise is\ntrue (and the argument is valid), this argument\nshows that the conclusion of the argument is\ntrue\u201d, just as it is a mistake for a non-theist to say\nthat the argument \u201cEither God does not exist, or 2+2=5. It is\nnot the case that 2+2=5. So God does not exist.\u201d shows that God\ndoes not exist. Similarly, it is a mistake for a theist to say:\n\u201cSince it is rational to accept the premises (and the\nargument is valid), this argument shows that it is\nrational to accept the claim that God exists\u201d, just as\nit is a mistake for the non-theist to say: \u201cSince it is\nrational to accept the premises of the non-theistic argument\n(and that argument is valid), the non-theistic argument shows\nthat it is rational to accept the claim that God does not\nexist\u201d. While there is room for dispute about exactly why all of\nthis is so, it is plausible to say that, in each case, any even\nminimally rational person who has doubts about the claimed status of\nthe conclusion of the argument will have exactly the same doubts about\nthe claimed status of the premise. If, for example, I doubt that it is\nrational to accept the claim that God exists, then you can be quite\nsure that I will doubt that it is rational to accept the claim that\neither 2+2=5 or God exists. But the very same point can be made about\nPlantinga\u2019s argument: anyone with even minimal rationality who\nunderstands the premise and the conclusion of the argument, and who\nhas doubts about the claim that it is rationally permissible to\nbelieve that there is an entity which possesses maximal greatness,\nwill have exactly the same doubts about the claim that it is\nrationally permissible to believe that there is a possible world in\nwhich there is an entity which possesses maximal greatness.\n\nFor further discussion of Plantinga\u2019s argument, see\u2014for\nexample\u2014Adams 1988, Chandler 1993, Oppy 1995 (70\u201378,\n248\u2013259), Rasmussen (2018), Tooley 1981, and van Inwagen\n1977).\n9. St. Anselm\u2019s Ontological Argument\n\nThere is an enormous literature on the material in Proslogion\nII-III. Some commentators deny that St. Anselm tried to put\nforward any proofs of the existence of God. Even among commentators\nwho agree that St. Anselm intended to prove the existence of God,\nthere is disagreement about where the proof is located. Some\ncommentators claim that the main proof is in Proslogion II,\nand that the rest of the work draws out corollaries of that proof\n(see, e.g., Charlesworth 1965). Other commentators claim that the main\nproof is in Prologion III, and that the proof in\nProslogion II is merely an inferior first attempt (see, e.g.,\nMalcolm 1960). Yet other commentators claim that there is a single\nproof which spans at least Proslogion II-III\u2014see, e.g.,\nCampbell 1976 and, perhaps, the entire work\u2014see, e.g., La Croix\n1972. In what follows, we ignore this aspect of the controversy about the\nProslogion. Instead, we focus just on the question of the\nanalysis of the material in Proslogion II on the assumption\nthat there is an independent argument for the existence of God which\nis given therein. \n\nHere is one translation of the crucial part of Proslogion II\n(due to William Mann (1972, 260\u20131); alternative translations can\nbe found in Barnes 1972, Campbell 1976, Charlesworth 1965, and\nelsewhere):\n\nThus even the fool is convinced that something than which nothing\ngreater can be conceived is in the understanding, since when he hears\nthis, he understands it; and whatever is understood is in the\nunderstanding. And certainly that than which a greater cannot be\nconceived cannot be in the understanding alone. For if it is even in\nthe understanding alone, it can be conceived to exist in reality also,\nwhich is greater. Thus if that than which a greater cannot be\nconceived is in the understanding alone, then that than which a\ngreater cannot be conceived is itself that than which a greater can be\nconceived. But surely this cannot be. Thus without doubt something\nthan which a greater cannot be conceived exists, both in the\nunderstanding and in reality.\n\n\nThere have been many ingenious attempts to find an argument which can\nbe expressed in modern logical formalism, which is logically valid,\nand which might plausibly be claimed to be the argument which\nis expressed in this passage. To take a few prime examples, Adams\n1971, Barnes 1972 and Oppenheimer and Zalta 1991 have all produced\nformally valid analyses of the argument in this passage. We begin with\na brief presentation of each of these analyses, preceded by a\npresentation of the formulation of the argument given by Plantinga\n1967, and including a presentation of some of the formulations of\nLewis 1970. (Chambers 2000 works with the analysis of Adams 1971.)\n9.1 Formulation 1\n\nGod exists in the understanding but not in reality. (Assumption for\nreductio)\nExistence in reality is greater than existence in the understanding\nalone. (Premise)\nA being having all of God\u2019s properties plus existence in reality\ncan be conceived. (Premise)\nA being having all of God\u2019s properties plus existence in reality\nis greater than God. (From (1) and (2).)\nA being greater than God can be conceived. (From (3) and\n(4).)\nIt is false that a being greater than God can be conceived. (From\ndefinition of \u201cGod\u201d.)\nHence, it is false that God exists in the understanding but not in\nreality. (From (1), (5), (6).)\nGod exists in the understanding. (Premise, to which even the Fool\nagrees.)\nHence God exists in reality. (From (7), (8).)\n\n\nSee Plantinga 1967.\n9.2 Formulation 2\n\nThe Fool understands the expression \u201cthe being than which no\ngreater can be conceived\u201d. (Premise)\nIf a person understands an expression \u201cb\u201d, then\nb is in that person\u2019s understanding. (Premise)\nIf a thing is in a person\u2019s understanding, then the person can\nconceive of that thing\u2019s existing in reality. (Premise)\nEach thing which exists in reality is greater than any thing which\nexists only in the understanding. (Premise)\nIf a person can conceive of something, and that thing entails\nsomething else, then the person can also conceive of that other thing.\n(Premise)\nIf a person can conceive that a specified object has a given property,\nthen that person can conceive that something or other has that\nproperty. (Premise)\nHence the being than which no greater can be conceived exists in\nreality. (From (1)-(6), by a complex series of steps here\nomitted.)\n\n\nSee Barnes 1972.\n9.3 Formulation 3\n\nThere is a thing x, and a magnitude m, such that\nx exists in the understanding, m is the magnitude of\nx, and it it not possible that there is a thing y\nand a magnitude n such that n is the magnitude of\ny and n>m. (Premise)\nFor any thing x and magnitude m, if x\nexists in the understanding, m is the magnitude of\nx, and it is not possible that there is a thing y\nand magnitude n such that n is the magnitude of\ny and n>m, then it is possible that\nx exists in reality. (Premise)\nFor any thing x and magnitude m, if m is\nthe magnitude of x, and it it not possible that there is a\nthing y and a magnitude n such that n is\nthe magnitude of y and n>m, and\nx does not exist in reality, then it is not possible that if\nx exists in reality then there is a magnitude n such\nthat n is greater than m and n is the\nmagnitude of x. (Premise)\n(Hence) There is a thing x and a magnitude m such\nthat x exist in the understanding, and x exists in\nreality, and m is the magnitude of x, and it it not\npossible that there is a thing y and a magnitude n\nsuch that n is the magnitude of y and\nn>m. (From 1, 2, 3)\n\n\nSee Adams 1971.\n9.4 Formulation 4\n\nFor any understandable being x, there is a world w\nsuch that x exists in w. (Premise)\nFor any understandable being x, and for any worlds w\nand v, if x exists in w, but x\ndoes not exist in v, then the greatness of x in\nw exceeds the greatness of x in v.\n(Premise)\nThere is an understandable being x such that for no world\nw and being y does the greatness of y in\nw exceed the greatness of x in the actual world.\n(Premise)\n(Hence) There is a being x existing in the actual world such\nthat for no world w and being y does the greatness\nof y in w exceed the greatness of x in the\nactual world. (From (1)-(3).)\n\n\nSee Lewis 1970.\n\nLewis also suggests an alternative to (3) which yields a valid\nargument:\n\n(3\u2032) There is an understandable being x such that for\nno worlds v and w and being y does the\ngreatness of y in w exceed the greatness of x in\nv.\n\n\nand two alternatives to (3)\u2014not presented here\u2014which yield\ninvalid arguments. (Of course, these further two alternatives are\ncrucial to Lewis\u2019 overall analysis of the passage: essentially,\nLewis suggests that Anselm equivocates between an invalid argument\nwith plausible premises and a valid argument with question-begging\npremises. In this respect, Lewis\u2019 analysis is quite different\nfrom the other analyses currently under discussion.)\n9.5 Formulation 5\n\nThere is (in the understanding) something than which there is no\ngreater. (Premise)\n(Hence) There is (in the understanding) a unique thing than which\nthere is no greater. (From (1), assuming that the\n\u201cgreater-than\u201d relation is connected.)\n(Hence) There is (in the understanding) something which is the thing\nthan which there is no greater. (From (2), by a theorem about\ndescriptions.)\n(Hence) There is (in the understanding) nothing which is greater than\nthe thing than which there is no greater. (From (3), by another\ntheorem about descriptions.)\nIf that thing than which there is no greater does not exist (in\nreality), then there is (in the understanding) something which is\ngreater than that thing than which there is no greater.\n(Premise)\n(Hence) That thing than which there is no greater exists (in reality).\n(From (4) and (5).)\n(Hence) God exists. (From (6).)\n\n\nSee Oppenheimer and Zalta 1991.\n\nOppenheimer and Zalta 2011 provides a \u201csimplified\u201d version\nof this argument, in which the number of controversial assumptions is\nreduced. Since they also provide a clear reason for thinking that this\nnew version of the argument is not persuasive, it won't be considered\nfurther here. \n9.6 Critical Appraisal\n\nConsidered as interpretations of the argument presented in the\nProslogion, these formulations are subject to various kinds\nof criticisms. \n\nFirst, the modal interpretations of Lewis 1970 and Adams 1971\ndon\u2019t square very well with the rest of the Proslogion:\nthe claim that \u201cbeing than which no greater can be\nconceived\u201d should be read as \u201cbeing than which no greater\nis possible\u201d would have us render the claim of Proslogion\n15 to be that God is a being greater than any which is possible.\nAnd that is surely a bad result.\n\nSecond, the Meinongian interpretations of Barnes 1972, Adams\n1971 and Oppenheimer and Zalta 1991 produce arguments which, given the\nprinciples involved, could easily be much simplified, and which are\nobviously vulnerable to Gaunilo-type objections.\n\nConsider, for example, the case of Oppenheimer and Zalta. They have\nAnselm committed to the claim that if anyone can understand the phrase\n\u201cthat than which F\u201d, then there is something in\nthe understanding such that F (see their footnote 25); and\nthey also have him committed to the claim that if there is something\nwhich is the F-thing, then it\u2014i.e., the\nF-thing\u2014has the property F (see page 7).\nPlainly though, if Anselm is really committed to these principles,\nthen he could hardly fail to be committed to the more general\nprinciples: (1) if anyone can understand the phrase \u201can\nF\u201d, then there is at least one F-thing in the\nunderstanding; and (2) if there are some things which are the\nF-things, then they\u2014i.e., the\nF-things\u2014must have the property F. (It would\nsurely be absurd to claim that Anselm is only committed to the less\ngeneral principles: what could possibly have justified the\nrestrictions to the special cases?)\n\nBut, then, mark the consequences. We all understand the expression\n\u201can existent perfect being\u201d. So, by the first claim, there\nis at least one existent perfect being in the understanding. And, by\nthe second claim, any existent perfect being is existent. So, from\nthese two claims combined, there is\u2014in reality\u2014at least\none existent perfect being.\n\nThis argument gives Anselm everything that he wants, and very much\nmore briefly. (The Proslogion goes on and on, trying to\nestablish the properties of that than which no greater can be\nconceived. How much easier if we can just explicitly build all of the\nproperties which want to \u201cderive\u201d into the initial\ndescription.) So, if Anselm really were committed to the principles\nwhich Oppenheimer and Zalta appear to attribute to him, it is hard to\nunderstand why he didn\u2019t give the simpler argument. And, of\ncourse, it is also hard to understand why he didn\u2019t take\nGaunilo\u2019s criticism. After all, when it is set out in this way,\nit is obvious that the argument proves far too much.\n\nThird, some of the arguments have Anselm committed to claims\nabout greatness which do not seem to correspond with what he actually\nsays. The natural reading of the text is that, if two beings are\nidentical save that one exists only in the understanding and the other\nexists in reality as well, then the latter is greater than the former.\nBut Barnes 1971, for example, has Anselm committed to the much\nstronger claim that any existing thing is greater than every\nnon-existent thing.\n\nGiven these kinds of considerations, it is natural to wonder whether\nthere are better interpretations of Proslogion II\naccording to which the argument in question turns out NOT to\nbe logically valid. Here is a modest attempt to provide such an\nanalysis:\n\nWe start with the claim that the Fool understands the expression\n\u201cbeing than which no greater can be conceived\u201d, i.e., even\nthe Fool can entertain the idea or possess the concept of a being than\nwhich no greater can be conceived. Now, entertaining this idea or\npossessing this concept requires the entertainer or possessor to\nrecognise certain relationships which hold between given properties\nand the idea or concept in question. For example, given that you\npossess the concept of, or entertain the idea of, a smallest really\nexistent Martian, it follows that you must recognise some kind of\nconnection between the properties of being a Martian, really existing,\nand being smaller than other really existing Martians, and the concept\nor idea in question.\n\nFollowing Anselm, we might say that, since you understand the\nexpression \u201csmallest really existent Martian\u201d, there is,\nin your understanding, at least one smallest really existent Martian.\n(Or, apparently following Descartes, one might say that real existence\nis \u201cpart of\u201d\u2014or \u201ccontained in\u201d\u2014the\nidea of a smallest really existent Martian.) However, in saying this,\nit must be understood that we are not actually predicating properties\nof anything: we aren\u2019t supposing that there is something which\npossesses the properties of being a Martian, really existing, and\nbeing no larger than any other Martian. (After all, we can safely\nsuppose, we don\u2019t think that any Martians really exist.) In\nother words, we must be able to have the concept of, or entertain the\nidea of, a smallest really existing Martian without believing that\nthere really are any smallest Martians. Indeed, more strongly, we must\nbe able to entertain the concept of a smallest really existent\nMartian\u2014and to recognise that the property of \u201creally\nexisting\u201d is part of this concept\u2014while nonetheless\nmaintaining that there are no smallest existent Martians.\n\nIt will be useful to introduce vocabulary to mark the point which is\nbeing made here. We could, for instance, distinguish between the\nproperties which are encoded in an idea or concept, and the\nproperties which are attributed in positive atomic beliefs\nwhich have that idea or concept as an ingredient. The idea\n\u201creally existent Santa Claus\u201d encodes the property of real\nexistence; but it is perfectly possible to entertain this idea without\nattributing real existence to Santa Claus, i.e., without believing\nthat Santa Claus really exists.\n\nWe can then apply this distinction to Anselm\u2019s argument. On the\none hand, the idea \u201cbeing than which no greater can be\nconceived\u201d encodes the property of real existence\u2014this is\nwhat the reductio argument establishes (if it establishes\nanything at all). On the other hand, it is perfectly possible to\nentertain the idea of a being than which no greater can be\nconceived\u2014and to recognise that this idea encodes the property\nof real existence\u2014without attributing real existence to a being\nthan which no greater can be conceived, i.e., without believing that a\nbeing than which no greater can be conceived really exists.\n\nOf course, the argument which Anselm actually presents pays no\nattention to this distinction between encoding and\nattributing\u2014i.e., between entertaining an idea and holding a\nbelief\u2014and nor does it pay attention to various other niceties.\nWe begin from the point that the Fool entertains the idea of that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived (because the Fool understands the\nwords \u201cthat than which no greater can be conceived\u201d). From\nthis, we move quickly to the claim that even the Fool is\n\u201cconvinced\u201d\u2014i.e., believes\u2014that that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived possesses the property of existing\nin the understanding. And then the reductio argument is\nproduced to establish that that than which no greater can be conceived\ncannot exist only in the understanding but must also possess the\nproperty of existing in reality as well (and all mention of the Fool,\nand what it is that the Fool believes, disappears).\n\nAs it stands, this is deeply problematic. How are we supposed to\nregiment the references to the Fool in the argument? Is the\nreductio argument supposed to tell us something about what\neven the Fool believes, or ought to believe? Are the earlier\nreferences to the Fool supposed to be inessential and eliminable? How\nare we so much as to understand the claim that even the Fool believes\nthat that than which no greater can be conceived exists in the\nunderstanding? And how do we get from the Fool\u2019s\nunderstanding the words \u201cthat than which no greater can\nbe conceived\u201d to his believing that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived possesses the property of existing in the\nunderstanding?\n\nFollowing the earlier line of thought, it seems that the\nargument might go something like this:\n\n\n\n(Even) the Fool has the concept of that than which no greater can be\nconceived.\n\n\n(Hence) (Even) the Fool believes that that than which no greater can\nbe conceived exists in the understanding.\n\n\nNo one who believes that that than which no greater can be conceived\nexists in the understanding can reasonably believe that that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived exists only in the\nunderstanding.\n\n\n(Hence) (Even) the Fool cannot reasonably deny that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived exists in reality\n\n\n(Hence) That than which no greater can be conceived exists in\nreality.\n\n\nWhile this is not a good argument, it could appear compelling to one\nwho failed to attend to the distinction between entertaining ideas and\nholding beliefs and who was a bit hazy on the distinction between the\nvehicles of belief and their contents. When the Fool entertains the\nconcept of that than which no greater can be conceived he recognises\nthat he is entertaining this concept (i.e., he believes that he is\nentertaining the concept of that than which no greater can be\nconceived\u2014or, as we might say, that the concept is in his\nunderstanding). Conflating the concept with its object, this gives us\nthe belief that than which no greater can be conceived possesses the\nproperty of existing in the understanding. Now, suppose as hypothesis\nfor reductio, that we can reasonably believe that that than\nwhich no greater can be conceived possesses the property of existing\nonly in the understanding. Ignoring the distinction between\nentertaining ideas and holding beliefs, this means that we when we\nentertain the idea of that than which no greater can be conceived, we\nentertain the idea of a being which exists only in the understanding.\nBut that is absurd: when we entertain the idea of that than which no\ngreater can be conceived, our idea encodes the property of existing in\nreality. So there is a contradiction, and we can conclude that, in\norder to be reasonable, we must believe that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived exists in reality. But if any reasonable\nperson must believe that that than which no greater can be conceived\nexists in reality, then surely it is the case that that than which no\ngreater can be conceived exists in reality. And so we are done.\n\nNo doubt this suggestion about the interpretation of Anselm\u2019s\nargument is deficient in various ways. However, the point of including\nit is illustrative rather than dogmatic. In the literature, there has\nbeen great resistance to the idea that the argument which Anselm gives\nis one which modern logicians would not hesitate to pronounce invalid.\nBut it is very hard to see why there should be this resistance.\n(Certainly, it is not something for which there is much argument in\nthe literature.) The text of the Proslogion is so rough, and\nso much in need of polishing, that we should not be too quick to\ndismiss the suggestion that Anselm\u2019s argument is rather more\nlike the argument most recently sketched than it is like the logically\nvalid demonstrations provided by commentators such as Barnes, Adams,\nand Oppenheimer and Zalta. (For a more complex analysis of\nProslogion II that has it yielding a valid argument, see\nHinst 2014.)\n10. Ontological Arguments in the 21st Century\n\nMany recent discussions of ontological arguments are in compendiums,\ncompanions, encyclopedias, and the like. So, for example, there are\nreview discussions of ontological arguments in: Leftow 2005, Matthews\n2005, Lowe 2007, Oppy 2007, and Maydole 2009. While the ambitions of\nthese review discussions vary, many of them are designed to introduce\nneophytes to the arguments and their history. Given the current\nexplosion of enthusiasm for compendiums, companions, encyclopedias, and\nthe like, in philosophy of religion, it is likely that many more such\ndiscussions will appear in the immediate future.\n\nSome recent discussions of ontological arguments have been placed in\nmore synoptic treatments of arguments about the existence of God. So,\nfor example, there are extended discussions of ontological arguments\nin Everitt 2004, Sobel 2004, and Oppy 2006. Sobel\u2019s examination\nof ontological arguments is exemplary. He provides one chapter on\n\u2018classical ontological arguments\u2019: Anselm, Descartes,\nSpinoza, and Kant\u2019s critique of ontological arguments; one\nchapter on \u2018modern modal ontological arguments\u2019:\nHartshorne, Malcolm and Plantinga; and one chapter on\nG\u00f6del\u2019s ontological argument. His analyses are very\ncareful, and make heavy use of the tools of modern philosophical\nlogic.\n\nThere has been one recent monograph devoted exclusively to the\nanalysis of ontological arguments: Dombrowski 2006. Dombrowski is a\nfan of Hartshorne: the aim of his book is to defend the claim that\nHartshorne\u2019s ontological argument is a success. While\nDombrowski\u2019s book is a useful addition to the literature because\nof the scope of its discussion of ontological arguments\u2014for\nexample, it contains a chapter on Rorty on ontological arguments, and\nanother chapter on John Taylor on ontological arguments\u2014even\nreviewers sympathetic to process theism have not been persuaded that\nit makes a strong case for its central thesis.\n\nSzatkowski (2012) is a recent collection of papers on ontological\narguments. A significant proportion of papers in this collection take\nup technical questions about logics that support ontological\nderivations. (Those interested in technical questions may also be\ninterested in the topic taken up in Oppenheimer and Zalta (2011) and\nGorbacz (2012).) The most recent collection is Oppy (2018). \n\nFinally, there has been some activity in journals. The most\nsignificant of these pieces is Millican 2004, the first article on\nontological arguments in recent memory to appear in Mind.\nMillican argues for a novel interpretation of Anselm\u2019s argument,\nand for a new critique of ontological arguments deriving from this\ninterpretation. Needless to say, both the interpretation and the\ncritique are controversial, but they are also worthy of attention.\nAmong other journal articles, perhaps the most interesting is Pruss\n2010, which provides a novel defence of the key possibility premise in\nmodal ontological arguments. There is also a chain of papers in\nAnalysis initiated by Matthews and Baker (2010)\n\nRelatively recent work on ontological arguments by women includes:\nAnscombe (1993), Antognazza (2018), Crocker (1972), Diamond (1977),\nFerreira (1983), Garcia (2008), [Haight and] Haight (1970), [Matthews\nand] Baker (2011), Wilson (1978) and Zagzebski (1984). \n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a name=\"PriTex\">Primary Texts</a>", "<a name=\"OthTex\">Other Texts</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a name=\"PriTex\">Primary Texts</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Anselm, St., <em>Proslogion</em>, in <em>St. Anselm\u2019s\nProslogion</em>, M.
