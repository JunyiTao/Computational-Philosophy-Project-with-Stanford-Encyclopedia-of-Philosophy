    "main_text": "Philosophy of Religion || The Conundrum of Reid's Philosophy of Religion\n8.1 The Conundrum of Reid's Philosophy of Religion\n\n\nReid confesses that his philosophy of mind and theory of\nperception are but a response to the theories of David Hume\n(Correspondence 210\u20131). Hume offers one of the most\nthorough and compelling philosophical indictments of religion\npenned in English. Yet Reid rarely isolates and discusses\nHume's anti-religious arguments. Furthermore,\nHume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion was\npublished in 1779 while Reid was lecturing on natural theology\nand long before Reid would publish his two sets\nof Essays. (Note that the Baird notes\u2014the set\nused to prepare Natural Theology\u2014were taken\nfrom lectures dating between February 11, 1780 to March 3rd,\n1780.) But this book had little discernible influence upon\nReid's thinking. Why did Reid mostly ignore Hume's great\nchallenges to rational belief in God?\n\n\nThere is no persuasive answer to this question, though several\nconverging considerations present themselves. One response is\nthat Hume's work in the philosophy of religion was not, in\nReid's opinion, deserving of a response. A second is that Reid\nwas aware that he lacked compelling arguments with which to\nrebut Hume's criticisms, whether because he modestly appraised\nhis counter-arguments, or because counter-arguments\ncirculating in the milieu were satisfactory. A third is that\nthe severe social climate in the Scotland of Reid's day\nobviated the need for Reid's response to Hume. Fourth, since\nReid's principal aims in philosophy of religion were to move\nthe debate from metaphysics to epistemology, perhaps Reid's\nsilence on many of Hume's criticisms is pointed.\n",
