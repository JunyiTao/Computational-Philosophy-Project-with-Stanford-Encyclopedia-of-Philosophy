    "main_text": "Defining Women || The Continental Tradition\n1.2 The Continental Tradition\n\nContinental feminists are often as concerned as Haslanger is with\ncommonality and normativity problems. Debra Bergoffen takes up\nBeauvoir\u2019s comparison of women and Black people in \u201cOf\nWomen and Slaves\u201d (2017) while Chandra Mohanty criticizes the\n\u201cadd and stir\u201d approach (2003, 518), which tries to\ncounter the exclusion of many women but still takes the experiences of\nwhite European heterosexual women as the base while mixing in the\nexperiences of others, say, Indonesian Nike workers, as if they were\nmere seasoning. Nor can the concerns be accommodated by taking\nIndonesian Nike workers as normative for non-Western women any more\nthan the concerns of mid-twentieth century Parisian women can be taken\nas normative for Western ones (2003, 34). Indeed, as Catherine Homan\nwrites, \u201cPursuing inclusion through the attempt to \u2018add\nwomen\u2019 or add people of color or any other traditionally\nmarginalized identity \u2018and stir\u2019 is bound to fail because\nit does not question the norms of the tradition in the first\nplace\u201d (2022).\n\nIn her 1990 and now-classic book, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the\nSubversion of Identity, Judith Butler pushes such concerns\nfurther by questioning the relation between construction and\nrepresentation. As a political movement, feminism supposes that it\nrepresents a set of pre-existing subjects, namely women, who are\nuniformly oppressed by a uniform patriarchy. Yet if we follow\nFoucault, we have to ask who these pre-existing subjects are. More\nspecifically, if we return to Beauvoir\u2019s claim that \u201cOne\nis not born, but rather becomes a women\u201d we have to ask who or\nwhat it is that becomes a woman. It is misleading to think of\noppression in terms of structures of power over against the subjects\nthat precede them because subjects, as the particular subjects they\nare, are first constituted through specific authorizations\n\u201cthrough the forms of power that regulate, control, represent\nand protect them.\u201d Hence, \u201cthe juridical formation of\nlanguage and politics that represents women as \u2018the\nsubject\u2019 of feminism is itself a discursive formation and effect\nof a given version of representational politics\u201d (1990, 2).\nWhile Beauvoir\u2019s claim assumes a pre-existing female sexed\nperson who acquires the attitudes, behaviors and aspirations of a\nfeminine gender through socialization, Butler maintains that it is\nthrough regimes of gender that we first conceive of bodies as sexed.\n\u201cGender is \u2026 the discursive/cultural means by which\n\u2018sexed nature\u2019 or \u2018a natural sex\u2019 is produced\nand established as \u2018prediscursive\u2019\u201d (1990, 7). This\ndiscursive formation of both gender and sex is not only inevitably\nexclusionary and not only \u201cthe mark imposed by the\noppressor\u201d (Wittig 1992, 11) but also inconsistent and\nincoherent both across different historical contexts (see Riley 1988)\nand in relation to race, class, sexual identities and so on.\n\nAs Butler points out, Luce Irigaray (1985) complicates matters\nfurther. Here Irigaray\u2019s reference is Beauvoir\u2019s claim\nthat a woman \u201cis defined and differentiated with reference to\nman and not he with reference to her; she is the incidental, the\ninessential as opposed to the essential. He is the Subject, he is the\nAbsolute \u2013 she is the Other\u201d (1953, 13). Beauvoir insists\nthat there is no time in history in which women were not the Other:\nmen are always the One and women are always the Other. Moreover, as\nthe Other, they live only in relation to the One and have no free\nhuman existence or subjectivity on their own. They occupy space in a\nman\u2019s world only as relative and inessential aspects of it. Yet\nIrigaray explains that if women are the Other to men they cannot be\ndefined independently of a definition of men. To define women as the\nOther of men is to articulate their identity within a vocabulary that\ntakes men as its norm. But if they cannot be defined independently of\nmen, how are they Other from them? If women can be articulated only\nwithin a male-normed language, then language cannot get at their\notherness at all. They are always, instead, part of a language system\nexpressing the One. The \u201cexclusion\u201d of women, Irigaray\nwrites, \u201cis internal to an order from which nothing escapes: the\norder of (man\u2019s) discourse. To the objection that this discourse\nis perhaps not all there is, the response will be that it is women who\nare \u2018not-all\u2019\u201d (1985, 88). Julia Kristeva agrees.\n\u201cA woman cannot be,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt is something\nwhich does not even belong in the order of being\u201d (1981, 137).\nThus, if women risk disappearing into various nodes of\nintersectionality in the analytic tradition, in the Continental they\nrisk being unable to be thought at all.\n\nIs there any way to rescue them? Butler is not wedded to the idea that\nwe need a stable conception of women. Rather, she wonders whether we\nshould entertain \u201ca radical critique that seeks to free feminist\ntheory from the necessity of having to construct a single or abiding\nground,\u201d and she asks whether \u201cthe construction of the\ncategory of women as a coherent and stable subject\u201d is \u201can\nunwitting regulation and reification of gender relations\u201d (1990,\n5).\n\nSome other feminists making use of Continental sources are unsure\nabout this conclusion. Iris Marion Young (1994) turns to Jean-Paul\nSartre\u2019s distinction between a series and a group. For Sartre, a\ngroup is a collection of people who consciously undertake a common\nproject together where the project typically is one best taken up by\nthis sort of group (1994, 724). Storming the Bastille is an example.\nIn contrast, a series is less organized and not at all self-conscious;\nhere the example is people waiting for a bus. These individuals\npossess a common interest in traveling along a certain route, but they\nhave, or need have, no direct relation to one another. This series\ncould become a group were individuals within it to start complaining\nabout the length of time they wait for the bus, and they could\nundertake together some sort of collective protest. Nonetheless,\nwithout this move toward collective action, they remain isolated from\none another and focused on the bus, which Sartre and Young call a\npractico-inert reality, rather than on each other.\n\nWomen, for Young, are a series, where one practico-inert reality is an\neffect of a compulsory heterosexuality that focuses on the features of\na body connected to sexual reproduction. Other practico-inert\nrealities include pronouns, verbal and visual representations,\nclothes, cosmetics, social spaces, and spaces associated with the\nsexual division of work and other activities. In each case, these\nrealities describe structures or objects to which individuals relate\nthemselves serially, as bus-riders relate themselves to a bus.\nConceiving of women as a series thus allows for the sense in which\nthey share certain features but in which they can also possess\nstriking differences in their relation to the realities that make them\npart of that series. Women are \u201ca serial collective defined\nneither by any common identity nor by a common set of attributes that\nall individual in the series share\u201d (1994, 737). At the same\ntime, they can always become a group through collective action.\n\nIn another broadly phenomenological attempt to rescue the common\nidentity of women, Linda Mart\u00edn Alcoff (2005) appeals to the\nphenomenology of Maurice Merleau-Ponty to anchor women\u2019s\nidentity in embodiment. Bodies and bodily experiences differ for men\nand women. These differences can stem from cultural practices that\npromote different ways of moving, siting, standing, running, speaking,\nand throwing a ball, for instance. Moreover, because of differences in\nphysical strength, men and women also approach the same task\ndifferently, using different parts of their bodies to do the same\nthings. Finally, in distinction from men, women\u2019s bodily\nexperiences include the \u201cexperience of breasts, menses,\nlactation and pregnancy\u201d (2005, 106). For Alcoff, these\ndifferences lead to differences in women\u2019s orientations or what,\nfollowing the hermeneutic philosopher Hans Georg Gadamer, she calls\nhorizons on themselves and their world. She does not deny that these\nhorizons vary according to the traditions and cultures to which\nvarious women belong; nor does she deny that horizons also vary\naccording to intersections with other factors, such as race and class.\nAt the same time, she argues, \u201cThe possibility of pregnancy,\nchildbirth, nursing, and in many societies, rape are parts of\nfemales\u2019 horizons \u2026 and they exist there because of the\nways they are embodied\u201d (2005, 176). Yet here again, the specter\nof false generalizations looms. Stephanie Julia Kapusta (2016)\nquestions Alcoff\u2019s emphasis on biological differences and\npregnancy given the way in which it can marginalize and inflict\npsychological, moral, or political harms on certain individuals,\nincluding trans people.\n\nOther hermeneutic approaches to women\u2019s identity include Georgia\nWarnke\u2019s After Identity: Rethinking Race, Sex and\nGender (2007) and Lauren Barthold\u2019s A Hermeneutic\nApproach to Gender and Other Social Identities (2016). Warnke\nclaims identities are interpretations of, or ways of understanding,\nwho we and others are. As such they necessarily comply with the\nconditions of understanding: they are culturally and historically\nsituated, motivated by particular concerns and interests and\ninevitably partial. We can thus understand people as women only in\nparticular contexts and ought not suppose their identities or\ncommonalities to extend beyond those contexts. For her part, while\nalso conceiving of women\u2019s identity in hermeneutic terms,\nBarthold questions both Alcoff\u2019s and Warnke\u2019s work. In her\nview a hermeneutic approach to identities must include an account of an\nindividual\u2019s various social identities and possibilities for\nnegotiating among them, an account of the individual\u2019s identity\nformation and an ability to assess the adequacy of particular social\nidentities in socio-political terms.\n",
