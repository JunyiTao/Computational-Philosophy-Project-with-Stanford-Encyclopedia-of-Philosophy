It is a\nprimary theme among ancient Greek, Hellenistic, and medieval\nphilosophers, and was central to eighteenth and nineteenth-century\nthought, as represented in treatments by such thinkers as Shaftesbury,\nHutcheson, Hume, Burke, Kant, Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Hanslick,\nand Santayana.

    "main_text": "\n1. Objectivity and Subjectivity\n\nPerhaps the most familiar basic issue in the theory of beauty is\nwhether beauty is subjective\u2014located \u2018in the eye of the\nbeholder\u2019\u2014or rather an objective feature of beautiful\nthings. A pure version of either of these positions seems implausible,\nfor reasons we will examine, and many attempts have been made to split\nthe difference or incorporate insights of both subjectivist and\nobjectivist accounts. Ancient and medieval accounts for the most part\nlocated beauty outside of anyone\u2019s particular experiences.\nNevertheless, that beauty is subjective was also a commonplace from\nthe time of the sophists. By the eighteenth century, Hume could write\nas follows, expressing one \u2018species of philosophy\u2019:\n\n\nBeauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the\nmind which contemplates them; and each mind perceives a different\nbeauty. One person may even perceive deformity, where another is\nsensible of beauty; and every individual ought to acquiesce in his own\nsentiment, without pretending to regulate those of others. (Hume 1757,\n136)\n\n\nAnd Kant launches his discussion of the matter in The Critique of\nJudgment (the Third Critique) at least as emphatically:\n\n\nThe judgment of taste is therefore not a judgment of cognition, and is\nconsequently not logical but aesthetical, by which we understand that\nwhose determining ground can be no other than subjective.\nEvery reference of representations, even that of sensations, may be\nobjective (and then it signifies the real [element] of an empirical\nrepresentation), save only the reference to the feeling of pleasure\nand pain, by which nothing in the object is signified, but through\nwhich there is a feeling in the subject as it is affected by the\nrepresentation. (Kant 1790, section 1)\n\n\nHowever, if beauty is entirely subjective\u2014that is, if anything\nthat anyone holds to be or experiences as beautiful is beautiful (as\nJames Kirwan, for example, asserts)\u2014then it seems that the word\nhas no meaning, or that we are not communicating anything when we call\nsomething beautiful except perhaps an approving personal attitude. In\naddition, though different persons can of course differ in particular\njudgments, it is also obvious that our judgments coincide to a\nremarkable extent: it would be odd or perverse for any person to deny\nthat a perfect rose or a dramatic sunset was beautiful. And it is\npossible actually to disagree and argue about whether something is\nbeautiful, or to try to show someone that something is beautiful, or\nlearn from someone else why it is.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems senseless to say that beauty has no\nconnection to subjective response or that it is entirely objective.\nThat would seem to entail, for example, that a world with no\nperceivers could be beautiful or ugly, or perhaps that beauty could be\ndetected by scientific instruments. Even if it could be, beauty would\nseem to be connected to subjective response, and though we may argue\nabout whether something is beautiful, the idea that one\u2019s\nexperiences of beauty might be disqualified as simply inaccurate or\nfalse might arouse puzzlement as well as hostility. We often regard\nother people\u2019s taste, even when it differs from our own, as\nprovisionally entitled to some respect, as we may not, for example, in\ncases of moral, political, or factual opinions. All plausible accounts\nof beauty connect it to a pleasurable or profound or loving response,\neven if they do not locate beauty purely in the eye of the\nbeholder.\n\nUntil the eighteenth century, most philosophical accounts of beauty\ntreated it as an objective quality: they located it in the beautiful\nobject itself or in the qualities of that object. In De Veritate\nReligione, Augustine asks explicitly whether things are beautiful\nbecause they give delight, or whether they give delight because they\nare beautiful; he emphatically opts for the second (Augustine, 247).\nPlato\u2019s account in the Symposium and Plotinus\u2019s\nin the Enneads connect beauty to a response of love and\ndesire, but locate beauty itself in the realm of the Forms, and the\nbeauty of particular objects in their participation in the Form.\nIndeed, Plotinus\u2019s account in one of its moments makes beauty a\nmatter of what we might term \u2018formedness\u2019: having the\ndefinite shape characteristic of the kind of thing the object is.\n\n\nWe hold that all the loveliness of this world comes by communion in\nIdeal-Form. All shapelessness whose kind admits of pattern and form,\nas long as it remains outside of Reason and Idea, is ugly from that\nvery isolation from the Divine-Thought. And this is the Absolute Ugly:\nan ugly thing is something that has not been entirely mastered by\npattern, that is by Reason, the Matter not yielding at all points and\nin all respects to Ideal-Form. But where the Ideal-Form has entered,\nit has grouped and coordinated what from a diversity of parts was to\nbecome a unity: it has rallied confusion into co-operation: it has\nmade the sum one harmonious coherence: for the Idea is a unity and\nwhat it moulds must come into unity as far as multiplicity may.\n(Plotinus, 22 [Ennead I, 6])\n\n\nIn this account, beauty is at least as objective as any other concept,\nor indeed takes on a certain ontological priority as more real than\nparticular Forms: it is a sort of Form of Forms.\n\nThough Plato and Aristotle disagree on what beauty is, they both\nregard it as objective in the sense that it is not localized in the\nresponse of the beholder. The classical conception\n (see below)\n treats beauty as a matter of instantiating definite proportions or\nrelations among parts, sometimes expressed in mathematical ratios, for\nexample the \u2018golden section.\u2019 The sculpture known as\n\u2018The Canon,\u2019 by Polykleitos (fifth/fourth century BCE),\nwas held up as a model of harmonious proportion to be emulated by\nstudents and masters alike: beauty could be reliably achieved by\nreproducing its objective proportions. Nevertheless, it is\nconventional in ancient treatments of the topic also to pay tribute to\nthe pleasures of beauty, often described in quite ecstatic terms, as\nin Plotinus: \u201cThis is the spirit that Beauty must ever induce:\nwonderment and a delicious trouble, longing and love and a trembling\nthat is all delight\u201d (Plotinus 23, [Ennead I, 3]).\n\nAt latest by the eighteenth century, however, and particularly in the\nBritish Isles, beauty was associated with pleasure in a somewhat\ndifferent way: pleasure was held to be not the effect but the origin\nof beauty. This was influenced, for example, by Locke\u2019s\ndistinction between primary and secondary qualities. Locke and the\nother empiricists treated color (which is certainly one source or\nlocus of beauty), for example, as a \u2018phantasm\u2019 of the\nmind, as a set of qualities dependent on subjective response, located\nin the perceiving mind rather than of the world outside the mind.\nWithout perceivers of a certain sort, there would be no colors. One\nargument for this was the variation in color experiences between\npeople. For example, some people are color-blind, and to a person with\njaundice much of the world allegedly takes on a yellow cast. In\naddition, the same object is perceived as having different colors by\nthe same the person under different conditions: at noon and midnight,\nfor example. Such variations are conspicuous in experiences of beauty\nas well.\n\nNevertheless, eighteenth-century philosophers such as Hume and Kant\nperceived that something important was lost when beauty was treated\nmerely as a subjective state. They saw, for example, that\ncontroversies often arise about the beauty of particular things, such\nas works of art and literature, and that in such controversies,\nreasons can sometimes be given and will sometimes be found convincing.\nThey saw, as well, that if beauty is completely relative to individual\nexperiencers, it ceases to be a paramount value, or even recognizable\nas a value at all across persons or societies.\n\nHume\u2019s \u201cOf the Standard of Taste\u201d and Kant\u2019s\nCritique Of Judgment attempt to find ways through what has\nbeen termed \u2018the antinomy of taste.\u2019 Taste is proverbially\nsubjective: de gustibus non est disputandum (about taste\nthere is no disputing). On the other hand, we do frequently dispute\nabout matters of taste, and some persons are held up as exemplars of\ngood taste or of tastelessness. Some people\u2019s tastes appear\nvulgar or ostentatious, for example. Some people\u2019s taste is too\nexquisitely refined, while that of others is crude, naive, or\nnon-existent. Taste, that is, appears to be both subjective and\nobjective: that is the antinomy.\n\nBoth Hume and Kant, as we have seen, begin by acknowledging that taste\nor the ability to detect or experience beauty is fundamentally\nsubjective, that there is no standard of taste in the sense that the\nCanon was held to be, that if people did not experience\ncertain kinds of pleasure, there would be no beauty. Both acknowledge\nthat reasons can count, however, and that some tastes are better than\nothers. In different ways, they both treat judgments of beauty neither\nprecisely as purely subjective nor precisely as objective but, as we\nmight put it, as inter-subjective or as having a social and cultural\naspect, or as conceptually entailing an inter-subjective claim to\nvalidity.\n\nHume\u2019s account focuses on the history and condition of the\nobserver as he or she makes the judgment of taste. Our practices with\nregard to assessing people\u2019s taste entail that judgments of\ntaste that reflect idiosyncratic bias, ignorance, or superficiality\nare not as good as judgments that reflect wide-ranging acquaintance\nwith various objects of judgment and are unaffected by arbitrary\nprejudices. Hume moves from considering what makes a thing beautiful\nto what makes a critic credible. \u201cStrong sense, united to\ndelicate sentiment, improved by practice, perfected by comparison, and\ncleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to this valuable\ncharacter; and the joint verdict of such, wherever they are to be found,\nis the true standard of taste and beauty\u201d (\u201cOf the\nStandard of Taste\u201d 1757, 144).\n\nHume argues further that the verdicts of critics who possess those\nqualities tend to coincide, and approach unanimity in the long run,\nwhich accounts, for example, for the enduring veneration of the works\nof Homer or Milton. So the test of time, as assessed by the verdicts\nof the best critics, functions as something analogous to an objective\nstandard. Though judgments of taste remain fundamentally subjective,\nand though certain contemporary works or objects may appear\nirremediably controversial, the long-run consensus of people who are\nin a good position to judge functions analogously to an objective\nstandard and renders such standards unnecessary even if they could be\nidentified. Though we cannot directly find a standard of beauty that\nsets out the qualities that a thing must possess in order to be\nbeautiful, we can describe the qualities of a good critic or a\ntasteful person. Then the long-run consensus of such persons is the\npractical standard of taste and the means of justifying judgments\nabout beauty.\n\nKant similarly concedes that taste is fundamentally subjective, that\nevery judgment of beauty is based on a personal experience, and that\nsuch judgments vary from person to person.\n\n\nBy a principle of taste I mean a principle under the condition of\nwhich we could subsume the concept of the object, and thus infer, by\nmeans of a syllogism, that the object is beautiful. But that is\nabsolutely impossible. For I must immediately feel the pleasure in the\nrepresentation of the object, and of that I can be persuaded by no\ngrounds of proof whatever. Although, as Hume says, all critics can\nreason more plausibly than cooks, yet the same fate awaits them. They\ncannot expect the determining ground of their judgment [to be derived]\nfrom the force of the proofs, but only from the reflection of the\nsubject upon its own proper state of pleasure or pain. (Kant 1790,\nsection 34)\n\n\nBut the claim that something is beautiful has more content merely than\nthat it gives me pleasure. Something might please me for reasons\nentirely eccentric to myself: I might enjoy a bittersweet experience\nbefore a portrait of my grandmother, for example, or the architecture\nof a house might remind me of where I grew up. \u201cNo one cares\nabout that,\u201d says Kant (1790, section 7): no one begrudges me\nsuch experiences, but they make no claim to guide or correspond to the\nexperiences of others.\n\nBy contrast, the judgment that something is beautiful, Kant argues, is\na disinterested judgment. It does not respond to my\nidiosyncrasies, or at any rate if I am aware that it does, I will no\nlonger take myself to be experiencing the beauty per se of the thing\nin question. Somewhat as in Hume\u2014whose treatment Kant evidently\nhad in mind\u2014one must be unprejudiced to come to a genuine\njudgment of taste, and Kant gives that idea a very elaborate\ninterpretation: the judgment must be made independently of the normal\nrange of human desires\u2014economic and sexual desires, for\ninstance, which are examples of our \u2018interests\u2019 in this\nsense. If one is walking through a museum and admiring the paintings\nbecause they would be extremely expensive were they to come up for\nauction, for example, or wondering whether one could steal and fence\nthem, one is not having an experience of the beauty of the paintings\nat all. One must focus on the form of the mental representation of the\nobject for its own sake, as it is in itself. Kant summarizes this as\nthe thought that insofar as one is having an experience of the beauty\nof something, one is indifferent to its existence. One takes pleasure,\nrather, in its sheer representation in one\u2019s experience:\n\n\nNow, when the question is whether something is beautiful, we do not\nwant to know whether anything depends or can depend on the existence\nof the thing, either for myself or anyone else, but how we judge it by\nmere observation (intuition or reflection). \u2026 We easily see\nthat, in saying it is beautiful, and in showing that I have\ntaste, I am concerned, not with that in which I depend on the\nexistence of the object, but with that which I make out of this\nrepresentation in myself. Everyone must admit that a judgement about\nbeauty, in which the least interest mingles, is very partial and is\nnot a pure judgement of taste. (Kant 1790, section 2)\n\n\nOne important source of the concept of aesthetic disinterestedness is\nthe Third Earl of Shaftesbury\u2019s dialogue The Moralists,\nwhere the argument is framed in terms of a natural landscape: if you\nare looking at a beautiful valley primarily as a valuable real estate\nopportunity, you are not seeing it for its own sake, and cannot fully\nexperience its beauty. If you are looking at a lovely woman and\nconsidering her as a possible sexual conquest, you are not able to\nexperience her beauty in the fullest or purest sense; you are\ndistracted from the form as represented in your experience. And\nShaftesbury, too, localizes beauty to the representational capacity of\nthe mind. (Shaftesbury 1738, 222)\n\nFor Kant, some beauties are dependent\u2014relative to the sort of\nthing the object is\u2014and others are free or absolute. A beautiful\nox would be an ugly horse, but abstract textile designs, for example,\nmay be beautiful without a reference group or \u201cconcept,\u201d\nand flowers please whether or not we connect them to their practical\npurposes or functions in plant reproduction (Kant 1790, section 16).\nThe idea in particular that free beauty is completely separated from\npractical use and that the experiencer of it is not concerned with the\nactual existence of the object leads Kant to conclude that absolute or\nfree beauty is found in the form or design of the\nobject, or as Clive Bell (1914) put it, in the arrangement of lines\nand colors (in the case of painting). By the time Bell writes in the\nearly twentieth century, however, beauty is out of fashion in the\narts, and Bell frames his view not in terms of beauty but in terms of\na general formalist conception of aesthetic value.\n\nSince in reaching a genuine judgment of taste one is aware that one is\nnot responding to anything idiosyncratic in oneself, Kant asserts\n(1790, section 8), one will reach the conclusion that anyone similarly\nsituated should have the same experience: that is, one will presume\nthat there ought to be nothing to distinguish one person\u2019s\njudgment from another\u2019s (though in fact there may be). Built\nconceptually into the judgment of taste is the assertion that anyone\nsimilarly situated ought to have the same experience and reach the\nsame judgment. Thus, built into judgments of taste is a\n\u2018universalization\u2019 somewhat analogous to the\nuniversalization that Kant associates with ethical judgments. In\nethical judgments, however, the universalization is objective: if the\njudgment is true, then it is objectively the case that everyone ought\nto act on the maxim according to which one acts. In the case of\naesthetic judgments, however, the judgment remains subjective, but\nnecessarily contains the \u2018demand\u2019 that everyone should\nreach the same judgment. The judgment conceptually entails a claim to\ninter-subjective validity. This accounts for the fact that we do very\noften argue about judgments of taste, and that we find tastes that are\ndifferent than our own defective.\n\nThe influence of this series of thoughts on philosophical aesthetics\nhas been immense. One might mention related approaches taken by such\nfigures as Schopenhauer (1818), Hanslick (1891), Bullough (1912), and\nCroce (1928), for example. A somewhat similar though more adamantly\nsubjectivist line is taken by Santayana, who defines beauty as\n\u2018objectified pleasure.\u2019 The judgment of something that it\nis beautiful responds to the fact that it induces a certain sort of\npleasure; but this pleasure is attributed to the object, as though the\nobject itself were having subjective states.\n\n\nWe have now reached our definition of beauty, which, in the terms of\nour successive analysis and narrowing of the conception, is value\npositive, intrinsic, and objectified. Or, in less technical language,\nBeauty is pleasure regarded as the quality of a thing. \u2026 Beauty\nis a value, that is, it is not a perception of a matter of fact or of\na relation: it is an emotion, an affection of our volitional and\nappreciative nature. An object cannot be beautiful if it can give\npleasure to nobody: a beauty to which all men were forever indifferent\nis a contradiction in terms. \u2026 Beauty is therefore a positive\nvalue that is intrinsic; it is a pleasure. (Santayana 1896,\n50\u201351)\n\n\nIt is much as though one were attributing malice to a balky object or\ndevice. The object causes certain frustrations and is then ascribed an\nagency or a kind of subjective agenda that would account for its\ncausing those effects. Now though Santayana thought the experience of\nbeauty could be profound or could even be the meaning of life, this\naccount appears to make beauty a sort of mistake: one attributes\nsubjective states (indeed, one\u2019s own) to a thing which in many\ninstances is not capable of having subjective states.\n\nIt is worth saying that Santayana\u2019s treatment of the topic in\nThe Sense of Beauty (1896) was the last major account offered\nin English for some time, possibly because, once beauty has been\nadmitted to be entirely subjective, much less when it is held to rest\non a sort of mistake, there seems little more to be said. What stuck\nfrom Hume\u2019s and Kant\u2019s treatments was the subjectivity,\nnot the heroic attempts to temper it. If beauty is a subjective\npleasure, it would seem to have no higher status than anything that\nentertains, amuses, or distracts; it seems odd or ridiculous to regard\nit as being comparable in importance to truth or justice, for example.\nAnd the twentieth century also abandoned beauty as the dominant goal\nof the arts, again in part because its trivialization in theory led\nartists to believe that they ought to pursue more urgent and more\nserious projects. More significantly, as we will see below, the\npolitical and economic associations of beauty with power tended to\ndiscredit the whole concept for much of the twentieth century. This\ndecline is explored eloquently in Arthur Danto\u2019s book The\nAbuse of Beauty (2003).\n\nHowever, there was a revival of interest in beauty in something like\nthe classical philosophical sense in both art and philosophy beginning\nin the 1990s, to some extent centered on the work of art critic Dave\nHickey, who declared that \u201cthe issue of the 90s will be\nbeauty\u201d (see Hickey 1993), as well as feminist-oriented\nreconstruals or reappropriations of the concept (see Brand 2000,\nIrigaray 1993). Several theorists made new attempts to address the\nantinomy of taste. To some extent, such approaches echo\nG.E. Moore\u2019s: \u201cTo say that a thing is beautiful is to say,\nnot indeed that it is itself good, but that it is a necessary element\nin something which is: to prove that a thing is truly beautiful is to\nprove that a whole, to which it bears a particular relation as a part,\nis truly good\u201d (Moore 1903, 201).  One interpretation of this\nwould be that what is fundamentally valuable is the situation in which\nthe object and the person experiencing are both embedded; the value of\nbeauty might include both features of the beautiful object and the\npleasures of the experiencer.\n\nSimilarly, Crispin Sartwell in his book Six Names of Beauty\n(2004), attributes beauty neither exclusively to the subject nor to\nthe object, but to the relation between them, and even more widely\nalso to the situation or environment in which they are both embedded.\nHe points out that when we attribute beauty to the night sky, for\ninstance, we do not take ourselves simply to be reporting a state of\npleasure in ourselves; we are turned outward toward it; we are\ncelebrating the real world. On the other hand, if there were no\nperceivers capable of experiencing such things, there would be no\nbeauty. Beauty, rather, emerges in situations in which subject and\nobject are juxtaposed and connected.\n\nAlexander Nehamas, in Only a Promise of Happiness (2007),\ncharacterizes beauty as an invitation to further experiences, a way\nthat things invite us in, while also possibly fending us off. The\nbeautiful object invites us to explore and interpret, but it also\nrequires us to explore and interpret: beauty is not to be regarded as\nan instantaneously apprehensible feature of surface. And Nehamas, like\nHume and Kant, though in another register, considers beauty to have an\nirreducibly social dimension. Beauty is something we share, or\nsomething we want to share, and shared experiences of beauty are\nparticularly intense forms of communication. Thus, the experience of\nbeauty is not primarily within the skull of the experiencer, but\nconnects observers and objects such as works of art and literature in\ncommunities of appreciation.\n\n\nAesthetic judgment, I believe, never commands universal agreement, and\nneither a beautiful object nor a work of art ever engages a catholic\ncommunity. Beauty creates smaller societies, no less important or\nserious because they are partial, and, from the point of view of its\nmembers, each one is orthodox\u2014orthodox, however, without\nthinking of all others as heresies. \u2026 What is involved is less\na matter of understanding and more a matter of hope, of\nestablishing a community that centers around it\u2014a\ncommunity, to be sure, whose boundaries are constantly shifting and\nwhose edges are never stable. (Nehamas 2007, 80\u201381)\n\n2. Philosophical Conceptions of Beauty\n\nEach of the views sketched below has many expressions, some of which\nmay be incompatible with one another. In many or perhaps most of the\nactual formulations, elements of more than one such account are\npresent. For example, Kant\u2019s treatment of beauty in terms of\ndisinterested pleasure has obvious elements of hedonism, while the\necstatic neo-Platonism of Plotinus includes not only the unity of the\nobject, but also the fact that beauty calls out love or adoration.\nHowever, it is also worth remarking how divergent or even incompatible\nwith one another many of these views are: for example, some\nphilosophers associate beauty exclusively with use, others precisely\nwith uselessness.\n2.1 The Classical Conception\n\nThe art historian Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin gives a fundamental\ndescription of the classical conception of beauty, as embodied in\nItalian Renaissance painting and architecture:\n\n\nThe central idea of the Italian Renaissance is that of perfect\nproportion. In the human figure as in the edifice, this epoch strove\nto achieve the image of perfection at rest within itself. Every form\ndeveloped to self-existent being, the whole freely co-ordinated:\nnothing but independently living parts\u2026. In the system of a\nclassic composition, the single parts, however firmly they may be\nrooted in the whole, maintain a certain independence. It is not the\nanarchy of primitive art: the part is conditioned by the whole, and\nyet does not cease to have its own life. For the spectator, that\npresupposes an articulation, a progress from part to part, which is a\nvery different operation from perception as a whole. (W\u00f6lfflin\n1932, 9\u201310, 15)\n\n\nThe classical conception is that beauty consists of an arrangement of\nintegral parts into a coherent whole, according to proportion,\nharmony, symmetry, and similar notions. This is a primordial Western\nconception of beauty, and is embodied in classical and neo-classical\narchitecture, sculpture, literature, and music wherever they appear.\nAristotle says in the Poetics that \u201cto be beautiful, a\nliving creature, and every whole made up of parts, must \u2026\npresent a certain order in its arrangement of parts\u201d (Aristotle,\nvolume 2, 2322 [1450b34]). And in the Metaphysics: \u201cThe\nchief forms of beauty are order and symmetry and definiteness, which\nthe mathematical sciences demonstrate in a special degree\u201d\n(Aristotle, volume 2, 1705 [1078a36]). This view, as Aristotle implies,\nis sometimes boiled down to a mathematical formula, such as the golden\nsection, but it need not be thought of in such strict terms. The\nconception is exemplified above all in such texts as Euclid\u2019s\nElements and such works of architecture as the Parthenon,\nand, again, by the Canon of the sculptor Polykleitos (late\nfifth/early fourth century BCE).\n\nThe Canon was not only a statue deigned to display perfect\nproportion, but a now-lost treatise on beauty. The physician Galen\ncharacterizes the text as specifying, for example, the proportions of\n\u201cthe finger to the finger, and of all the fingers to the\nmetacarpus, and the wrist, and of all these to the forearm, and of the\nforearm to the arm, in fact of everything to everything\u2026. For\nhaving taught us in that treatise all the symmetriae of the\nbody, Polyclitus supported his treatise with a work, having made the\nstatue of a man according to his treatise, and having called the\nstatue itself, like the treatise, the Canon\u201d (quoted in\nPollitt 1974, 15). It is important to note that the concept of\n\u2018symmetry\u2019 in classical texts is distinct from and richer\nthan its current use to indicate bilateral mirroring. It also refers\nprecisely to the sorts of harmonious and measurable proportions among\nthe parts characteristic of objects that are beautiful in the\nclassical sense, which carried also a moral weight. For example, in\nthe Sophist (228c-e), Plato describes virtuous souls as\nsymmetrical.\n\nThe ancient Roman architect Vitruvius epitomizes the classical\nconception in central, and extremely influential, formulations, both\nin its complexities and, appropriately enough, in its underlying\nunity:\n\n\nArchitecture consists of Order, which in Greek is called\ntaxis, and arrangement, which the Greeks name\ndiathesis, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Decor and\nDistribution which in the Greeks is called oeconomia.\n\nOrder is the balanced adjustment of the details of the work\nseparately, and as to the whole, the arrangement of the proportion\nwith a view to a symmetrical result.\n\nProportion implies a graceful semblance: the suitable display of\ndetails in their context. This is attained when the details of the\nwork are of a height suitable to their breadth, of a breadth suitable\nto their length; in a word, when everything has a symmetrical\ncorrespondence.\n\nSymmetry also is the appropriate harmony arising out of the details of\nthe work itself: the correspondence of each given detail to the form\nof the design as a whole. As in the human body, from cubit, foot,\npalm, inch and other small parts come the symmetric quality of\neurhythmy. (Vitruvius, 26\u201327)\n\n\nAquinas, in a typically Aristotelian pluralist formulation, says that\n\u201cThere are three requirements for beauty. Firstly, integrity or\nperfection\u2014for if something is impaired it is ugly. Then there\nis due proportion or consonance. And also clarity: whence things that\nare brightly coloured are called beautiful\u201d (Summa\nTheologica I, 39, 8).\n\nFrancis Hutcheson in the eighteenth century gives what may well be the\nclearest expression of the view: \u201cWhat we call Beautiful in\nObjects, to speak in the Mathematical Style, seems to be in a compound\nRatio of Uniformity and Variety; so that where the Uniformity of Bodys\nis equal, the Beauty is as the Variety; and where the Variety is\nequal, the Beauty is as the Uniformity\u201d (Hutcheson 1725, 29).\nIndeed, proponents of the view often speak \u201cin the Mathematical\nStyle.\u201d Hutcheson goes on to adduce mathematical formulae, and\nspecifically the propositions of Euclid, as the most beautiful objects\n(in another echo of Aristotle), though he also rapturously praises\nnature, with its massive complexity underlain by universal physical\nlaws as revealed, for example, by Newton. There is beauty, he says,\n\u201cIn the Knowledge of some great Principles, or universal Forces,\nfrom which innumerable Effects do flow. Such is Gravitation, in Sir\nIsaac Newton\u2019s Scheme\u201d (Hutcheson 1725, 38).\n\nA very compelling series of refutations of and counter-examples to the\nidea that beauty can be a matter of any specific proportions between\nparts, and hence to the classical conception, is given by Edmund Burke\nin A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the\nBeautiful and the Sublime:\n\n\nTurning our eyes to the vegetable kingdom, we find nothing there so\nbeautiful as flowers; but flowers are of every sort of shape, and\nevery sort of disposition; they are turned and fashioned into an\ninfinite variety of forms. \u2026 The rose is a large flower, yet it\ngrows upon a small shrub; the flower of the apple is very small, and\nit grows upon a large tree; yet the rose and the apple blossom are\nboth beautiful. \u2026 The swan, confessedly a beautiful bird, has a\nneck longer than the rest of its body, and but a very short tail; is\nthis a beautiful proportion? we must allow that it is. But what shall\nwe say of the peacock, who has comparatively but a short neck, with a\ntail longer than the neck and the rest of the body taken together?\n\u2026 There are some parts of the human body, that are observed to\nhold certain proportions to each other; but before it can be proved,\nthat the efficient cause of beauty lies in these, it must be shewn,\nthat wherever these are found exact, the person to whom they belong is\nbeautiful. \u2026 For my part, I have at several times very\ncarefully examined many of these proportions, and found them to hold\nvery nearly, or altogether alike in many subjects, which were not only\nvery different from one another, but where one has been very\nbeautiful, and the other very remote from beauty. \u2026 You may\nassign any proportions you please to every part of the of the human\nbody; and I undertake, that a painter shall observe them all, and\nnotwithstanding produce, if he pleases, a very ugly figure. (Burke\n1757, 84\u201389)\n\n2.2 The Idealist Conception\n\nThere are many ways to interpret Plato\u2019s relation to classical\naesthetics. The political system sketched in the Republic\ncharacterizes justice in terms of the relation of part and whole. But\nPlato was also no doubt a dissident in classical culture, and the\naccount of beauty that is expressed specifically in\nthe Symposium\u2014perhaps the key Socratic text for\nneo-Platonism and for the idealist conception of\nbeauty\u2014expresses an aspiration toward beauty as perfect\nunity.\n\nIn the midst of a drinking party, Socrates recounts the teachings of\nhis instructress, one Diotima, on matters of love. She connects the\nexperience of beauty to the erotic or the desire to reproduce (Plato,\n558\u201359 [Symposium 206c\u2013207e]). But the desire to\nreproduce is associated in turn with a desire for the immortal or\neternal: \u201cAnd why all this longing for propagation? Because this\nis the one deathless and eternal element in our mortality. And since\nwe have agreed that the lover longs for the good to be his own\nforever, it follows that we are bound to long for immortality as well\nas for the good\u2014which is to say that Love is a longing for\nimmortality\u201d (Plato, 559, [Symposium\n206e\u2013207a]). What follows is, if not classical, at any rate\nclassic:\n\n\nThe candidate for this initiation cannot, if his efforts are to be\nrewarded, begin too early to devote himself to the beauties of the\nbody. First of all, if his preceptor instructs him as he should, he\nwill fall in love with the beauty of one individual body, so that his\npassion may give life to noble discourse. Next he must consider how\nnearly related the beauty of any one body is to the beauty of any\nother, and he will see that if he is to devote himself to loveliness\nof form it will be absurd to deny that the beauty of each and every\nbody is the same. Having reached this point, he must set himself to be\nthe lover of every lovely body, and bring his passion for the one into\ndue proportion by deeming it of little or no importance.\n\nNext he must grasp that the beauties of the body are as nothing to the\nbeauties of the soul, so that wherever he meets with spiritual\nloveliness, even in the husk of an unlovely body, he will find it\nbeautiful enough to fall in love with and cherish\u2014and beautiful\nenough to quicken in his heart a longing for such discourse as tends\ntoward the building of a noble nature. And from this he will be led to\ncontemplate the beauty of laws and institutions. And when he discovers\nhow every kind of beauty is akin to every other he will conclude that\nthe beauty of the body is not, after all, of so great moment.\n\u2026\n\nAnd so, when his prescribed devotion to boyish beauties has carried\nour candidate so far that the universal beauty dawns upon his inward\nsight, he is almost within reach of the final revelation. \u2026\nStarting from individual beauties, the quest for universal beauty must\nfind him mounting the heavenly ladder, stepping from rung to\nrung\u2014that is, from one to two, and from two to every\nlovely body, and from bodily beauty to the beauty of institutions,\nfrom institutions to learning, and from learning in general to the\nspecial lore that pertains to nothing but the beautiful\nitself\u2014until at last he comes to know what beauty is.\n\nAnd if, my dear Socrates, Diotima went on, man\u2019s life is ever\nworth living, it is when he has attained this vision of the very soul\nof beauty. (Plato, 561\u201363 [Symposium\n210a\u2013211d])\n\n\nBeauty here is conceived\u2014perhaps explicitly in contrast to the\nclassical aesthetics of integral parts and coherent whole\u2014as\nperfect unity, or indeed as the principle of unity itself.\n\nPlotinus, as we have already seen, comes close to equating beauty with\nformedness per se: it is the source of unity among disparate things,\nand it is itself perfect unity. Plotinus specifically attacks what we\nhave called the classical conception of beauty:\n\n\nAlmost everyone declares that the symmetry of parts towards each other\nand towards a whole, with, besides, a certain charm of colour,\nconstitutes the beauty recognized by the eye, that in visible things,\nas indeed in all else, universally, the beautiful thing is essentially\nsymmetrical, patterned.\n\nBut think what this means.\n\nOnly a compound can be beautiful, never anything devoid of parts; and\nonly a whole; the several parts will have beauty, not in themselves,\nbut only as working together to give a comely total. Yet beauty in an\naggregate demands beauty in details; it cannot be constructed out of\nugliness; its law must run throughout.\n\nAll the loveliness of colour and even the light of the sun, being\ndevoid of parts and so not beautiful by symmetry, must be ruled out of\nthe realm of beauty. And how comes gold to be a beautiful thing? And\nlightning by night, and the stars, why are these so fair?\n\nIn sounds also the simple must be proscribed, though often in a whole\nnoble composition each several tone is delicious in itself. (Plotinus,\n21 [Ennead I,6])\n\n\nPlotinus declares that fire is the most beautiful physical thing,\n\u201cmaking ever upwards, the subtlest and sprightliest of all\nbodies, as very near to the unembodied. \u2026 Hence the splendour\nof its light, the splendour that belongs to the Idea\u201d (Plotinus,\n22 [Ennead I,3]). For Plotinus as for Plato, all multiplicity must be\nimmolated finally into unity, and all roads of inquiry and experience\nlead toward the Good/Beautiful/True/Divine.\n\nThis gave rise to a basically mystical vision of the beauty of God\nthat, as Umberto Eco has argued, persisted alongside an anti-aesthetic\nasceticism throughout the Middle Ages: a delight in profusion that\nfinally merges into a single spiritual unity. In the sixth century,\nPseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite characterized the whole of creation as\nyearning toward God; the universe is called into being by love of God\nas beauty (Pseudo-Dionysius, 4.7; see Kirwan 1999, 29).\nSensual/aesthetic pleasures could be considered the expressions of the\nimmense, beautiful profusion of God and our ravishment thereby. Eco\nquotes Suger, Abbot of St Denis in the twelfth century, describing a\nrichly-appointed church:\n\n\nThus, when\u2014out of my delight in the beauty of the house of\nGod\u2014the loveliness of the many-colored gems has called me away\nfrom external cares, and worthy meditation has induced me to reflect,\ntransferring that which is material to that which is immaterial, on\nthe diversity of the sacred virtues: then it seems to me that I see\nmyself dwelling, as it were, in some strange region of the universe\nwhich neither exists entirely in the slime of the earth nor entirely\nin the purity of Heaven; and that, by the grace of God, I can be\ntransported from this inferior to that higher world in an anagogical\nmanner. (Eco 1959, 14)\n\n\nThis conception has had many expressions in the modern era, including\nin such figures as Shaftesbury, Schiller, and Hegel, according to whom\nthe aesthetic or the experience of art and beauty is a primary bridge\n(or to use the Platonic image, stairway or ladder) between the\nmaterial and the spiritual. For Shaftesbury, there are three levels of\nbeauty: what God makes (nature); what human beings make from nature or\nwhat is transformed by human intelligence (art, for example); and\nfinally, the intelligence that makes even these artists (that is,\nGod). Shaftesbury\u2019s character Theocles describes \u201cthe\nthird order of beauty,\u201d\n\n\nwhich forms not only such as we call mere forms but even the forms\nwhich form. For we ourselves are notable architects in matter, and can\nshow lifeless bodies brought into form, and fashioned by our own\nhands, but that which fashions even minds themselves, contains in\nitself all the beauties fashioned by those minds, and is consequently\nthe principle, source, and fountain of all beauty. \u2026 Whatever\nappears in our second order of forms, or whatever is derived or\nproduced from thence, all this is eminently, principally, and\noriginally in this last order of supreme and sovereign beauty.\n\u2026 Thus architecture, music, and all which is of human\ninvention, resolves itself into this last order. (Shaftesbury 1738,\n228\u201329)\n\n\nSchiller\u2019s expression of a similar series of thoughts was\nfundamentally influential on the conceptions of beauty developed\nwithin German Idealism:\n\n\nThe pre-rational concept of Beauty, if such a thing be adduced, can be\ndrawn from no actual case\u2014rather does itself correct and guide\nour judgement concerning every actual case; it must therefore be\nsought along the path of abstraction, and it can be inferred simply\nfrom the possibility of a nature that is both sensuous and rational;\nin a word, Beauty must be exhibited as a necessary condition of\nhumanity. Beauty \u2026 makes of man a whole, complete in himself.\n(1795, 59\u201360, 86)\n\n\nFor Schiller, beauty or play or art (he uses the words, rather\ncavalierly, almost interchangeably) performs the process of\nintegrating or rendering compatible the natural and the spiritual, or\nthe sensuous and the rational: only in such a state of integration are\nwe\u2014who exist simultaneously on both these levels\u2014free.\nThis is quite similar to Plato\u2019s \u2018ladder\u2019: beauty as\na way to ascend to the abstract or spiritual. But\nSchiller\u2014though this is at times unclear\u2014is more concerned\nwith integrating the realms of nature and spirit than with\ntranscending the level of physical reality entirely, a la Plato. It is\nbeauty and art that performs this integration.\n\nIn this and in other ways\u2014including in the tripartite\ndialectical structure of his account\u2014Schiller strikingly\nanticipates Hegel, who writes as follows.\n\n\nThe philosophical Concept of the beautiful, to indicate its true\nnature at least in a preliminary way, must contain, reconciled within\nitself, both the extremes which have been mentioned [the ideal and the\nempirical] because it unites metaphysical universality with real\nparticularity. (Hegel 1835, 22)\n\n\nBeauty, we might say, or artistic beauty at any rate, is a route from\nthe sensuous and particular to the Absolute and to freedom, from\nfinitude to the infinite, formulations that\u2014while they are\ninfluenced by Schiller\u2014strikingly recall Shaftesbury, Plotinus,\nand Plato.\n\nHegel, who associates beauty and art with mind and spirit, holds with\nShaftesbury that the beauty of art is higher than the beauty of\nnature, on the grounds that, as Hegel puts it, \u201cthe beauty of\nart is born of the spirit and born again\u201d (Hegel 1835,\n2). That is, the natural world is born of God, but the beauty of art\ntransforms that material again by the spirit of the artist. This idea\nreaches is apogee in Benedetto Croce, who very nearly denies that\nnature can ever be beautiful, or at any rate asserts that the beauty\nof nature is a reflection of the beauty of art. \u201cThe real\nmeaning of \u2018natural beauty\u2019 is that certain persons,\nthings, places are, by the effect which they exert upon one,\ncomparable with poetry, painting, sculpture, and the other arts\u201d\n(Croce 1928, 230).\n2.3 Love and Longing\n\nEdmund Burke, expressing an ancient tradition, writes that, \u201cby\nbeauty I mean, that quality or those qualities in bodies, by which\nthey cause love, or some passion similar to it\u201d (Burke 1757,\n83). As we have seen, in almost all treatments of beauty, even the\nmost apparently object or objectively-oriented, there is a moment in\nwhich the subjective qualities of the experience of beauty are\nemphasized: rhapsodically, perhaps, or in terms of pleasure or\nataraxia, as in Schopenhauer. For example, we have already\nseen Plotinus, for whom beauty is certainly not subjective, describe\nthe experience of beauty ecstatically. In the idealist tradition, the\nhuman soul, as it were, recognizes in beauty its true origin and\ndestiny. Among the Greeks, the connection of beauty with love is\nproverbial from early myth, and Aphrodite the goddess of love won the\nJudgment of Paris by promising Paris the most beautiful woman in the\nworld.\n\nThere is an historical connection between idealist accounts of beauty\nand those that connect it to love and longing, though there would seem\nto be no entailment either way. We have Sappho\u2019s famous fragment\n16: \u201cSome say thronging cavalry, some say foot soldiers, others\ncall a fleet the most beautiful sights the dark world offers, but I\nsay it\u2019s whatever you love best\u201d (Sappho, 16). (Indeed, at\nPhaedrus 236c, Socrates appears to defer to \u201cthe fair\nSappho\u201d as having had greater insight than himself on love\n[Plato, 483].)\n\nPlato\u2019s discussions of beauty in the Symposium and the\nPhaedrus occur in the context of the theme of erotic love. In\nthe former, love is portrayed as the \u2018child\u2019 of poverty\nand plenty. \u201cNor is he delicate and lovely as most of us\nbelieve, but harsh and arid, barefoot and homeless\u201d (Plato, 556\n[Symposium 203b\u2013d]). Love is portrayed as a lack or absence that\nseeks its own fulfillment in beauty: a picture of mortality as an\ninfinite longing. Love is always in a state of lack and hence of\ndesire: the desire to possess the beautiful. Then if this state of\ninfinite longing could be trained on the truth, we would have a path\nto wisdom. The basic idea has been recovered many times, for example\nby the Romantics. It fueled the cult of idealized or courtly love\nthrough the Middle Ages, in which the beloved became a symbol of the\ninfinite.\n\nRecent work on the theory of beauty has revived this idea, and turning\naway from pleasure has turned toward love or longing (which are not\nnecessarily entirely pleasurable experiences) as the experiential\ncorrelate of beauty. Both Sartwell and Nehamas use Sappho\u2019s\nfragment 16 as an epigraph. Sartwell defines beauty as \u201cthe\nobject of longing\u201d and characterizes longing as intense and\nunfulfilled desire. He calls it a fundamental condition of a finite\nbeing in time, where we are always in the process of losing whatever\nwe have, and are thus irremediably in a state of longing. And Nehamas\nwrites that \u201cI think of beauty as the emblem of what we lack, the mark\nof an art that speaks to our desire. \u2026 Beautiful things\ndon\u2019t stand aloof, but direct our attention and our desire to\neverything else we must learn or acquire in order to understand and\npossess, and they quicken the sense of life, giving it new shape and\ndirection\u201d (Nehamas 2007, 77).\n2.4 Hedonist Conceptions\n\nThinkers of the 18th century\u2014many of them oriented\ntoward empiricism\u2014accounted for beauty in terms of pleasure. The\nItalian historian Ludovico Antonio Muratori, for example, in quite a\ntypical formulation, says that \u201cBy beautiful we\ngenerally understand whatever, when seen, heard, or understood,\ndelights, pleases, and ravishes us by causing within us agreeable\nsensations\u201d (see Carritt 1931, 60). In Hutcheson it is not clear\nwhether we ought to conceive beauty primarily in terms of classical\nformal elements or in terms of the viewer\u2019s pleasurable\nresponse. He begins the Inquiry Into the Original of Our Ideas of\nBeauty and Virtue with a discussion of pleasure. And he appears\nto assert that objects which instantiate his \u2018compound ratio of\nuniformity and variety\u2019 are peculiarly or necessarily capable of\nproducing pleasure:\n\n\nThe only Pleasure of sense, which our Philosophers seem to consider,\nis that which accompanys the simple Ideas of Sensation; But there are\nvastly greater Pleasures in those complex Ideas of objects, which\nobtain the Names of Beautiful, Regular, Harmonious. Thus every one\nacknowledges he is more delighted with a fine Face, a just Picture,\nthan with the View of any one Colour, were it as strong and lively as\npossible; and more pleased with a Prospect of the Sun arising among\nsettled Clouds, and colouring their Edges, with a starry Hemisphere, a\nfine Landskip, a regular Building, than with a clear blue Sky, a\nsmooth Sea, or a large open Plain, not diversify\u2019d by Woods,\nHills, Waters, Buildings: And yet even these latter Appearances are\nnot quite simple. So in Musick, the Pleasure of fine Composition is\nincomparably greater than that of any one Note, how sweet, full, or\nswelling soever. (Hutcheson 1725, 22)\n\n\nWhen Hutcheson then goes on to describe \u2018original or absolute\nbeauty,\u2019 he does it, as we have seen, in terms of the qualities\nof the beautiful thing (a \u201ccompound ratio\u201d of uniformity and variety),\nand yet throughout, he insists that beauty is centered in the human\nexperience of pleasure. But of course the idea of pleasure could come\napart from Hutcheson\u2019s particular aesthetic preferences, which\nare poised precisely opposite Plotinus\u2019s, for example. That we\nfind pleasure in a symmetrical rather than an asymmetrical building\n(if we do) is contingent. But that beauty is connected to pleasure\nappears, according to Hutcheson, to be necessary, and the pleasure\nwhich is the locus of beauty itself has ideas rather than things as\nits objects.\n\nHume writes in a similar vein in the Treatise of Human\nNature:\n\n\nBeauty is such an order and construction of parts as, either by the\nprimary constitution of our nature, by custom, or by caprice, is\nfitted to give a pleasure and satisfaction to the soul. \u2026\nPleasure and pain, therefore, are not only necessary attendants of\nbeauty and deformity, but constitute their very essence. (Hume 1740,\n299)\n\n\nThough this appears ambiguous as between locating the beauty in the\npleasure or in the impression or idea that causes it, Hume is soon\ntalking about the \u2018sentiment of beauty,\u2019 where sentiment\nis, roughly, a pleasurable or painful response to impressions or\nideas, though the experience of beauty is a matter of cultivated or\ndelicate pleasures. Indeed, by the time of Kant\u2019s Third Critique\nand after that for perhaps two centuries, the direct connection of\nbeauty to pleasure is taken as a commonplace, to the point where\nthinkers are frequently identifying beauty as a certain sort of\npleasure. Santayana, for example, as we have seen, while still\ngesturing in the direction of the object or experience that causes\npleasure, emphatically identifies beauty as a certain sort of\npleasure.\n\nOne result of this approach to beauty\u2014or perhaps an extreme\nexpression of this orientation\u2014is the assertion of the\npositivists that words such as \u2018beauty\u2019 are meaningless or\nwithout cognitive content, or are mere expressions of subjective\napproval. Hume and Kant were no sooner declaring beauty to be a matter\nof sentiment or pleasure and therefore to be subjective than they were\ntrying to ameliorate the sting, largely by emphasizing critical\nconsensus. But once this fundamental admission is made, any consensus\nseems contingent. Another way to formulate this is that it appears to\ncertain thinkers after Hume and Kant that there can be no\nreasons to prefer the consensus to a counter-consensus\nassessment. A.J. Ayer writes:\n\n\nSuch aesthetic words as \u2018beautiful\u2019 and\n\u2018hideous\u2019 are employed \u2026 not to make statements of\nfact, but simply to express certain feelings and evoke a certain\nresponse. It follows\u2026that there is no sense attributing\nobjective validity to aesthetic judgments, and no possibility of\narguing about questions of value in aesthetics. (Ayer 1952, 113)\n\n\nAll meaningful claims either concern the meaning of terms or are\nempirical, in which case they are meaningful because observations\ncould confirm or disconfirm them. \u2018That song is beautiful\u2019\nhas neither status, and hence has no empirical or conceptual content.\nIt merely expresses a positive attitude of a particular viewer; it is\nan expression of pleasure, like a satisfied sigh. The question of\nbeauty is not a genuine question, and we can safely leave it behind or\nalone. Most twentieth-century philosophers did just that.\n2.5 Use and Uselessness\n\nPhilosophers in the Kantian tradition identify the experience of\nbeauty with disinterested pleasure, psychical distance, and the like,\nand contrast the aesthetic with the practical. \u201cTaste\nis the faculty of judging an object or mode of representing it by an\nentirely disinterested satisfaction or dissatisfaction. The\nobject of such satisfaction is called beautiful\u201d (Kant\n1790, 45). Edward Bullough distinguishes the beautiful from the merely\nagreeable on the grounds that the former requires a distance from\npractical concerns: \u201cDistance is produced in the first instance\nby putting the phenomenon, so to speak, out of gear with our\npractical, actual self; by allowing it to stand outside the context of\nour personal needs and ends\u201d (Bullough 1912, 244).\n\nOn the other hand, many philosophers have gone in the opposite\ndirection and have identified beauty with suitedness to use.\n\u2018Beauty\u2019 is perhaps one of the few terms that could\nplausibly sustain such entirely opposed interpretations.\n\nAccording to Diogenes Laertius, the ancient hedonist Aristippus of\nCyrene took a rather direct approach.\n\n\nIs not then, also, a beautiful woman useful in proportion as she is\nbeautiful; and a boy and a youth useful in proportion to their beauty?\nWell then, a handsome boy and a handsome youth must be useful exactly\nin proportion as they are handsome. Now the use of beauty is, to be\nembraced. If then a man embraces a woman just as it is useful that he\nshould, he does not do wrong; nor, again, will he be doing wrong in\nemploying beauty for the purposes for which it is useful. (Diogenes\nLaertius, 94)\n\n\nIn some ways, Aristippus is portrayed parodically: as the very worst\nof the sophists, though supposedly a follower of Socrates. And yet the\nidea of beauty as suitedness to use finds expression in a number of\nthinkers. Xenophon\u2019s Memorabilia puts the view in the\nmouth of Socrates, with Aristippus as interlocutor:\n\n\nSocrates: In short everything which we use is considered both\ngood and beautiful from the same point of view, namely its use.\n\nAristippus: Why then, is a dung-basket a beautiful thing?\n\nSocrates: Of course it is, and a golden shield is ugly, if\nthe one be beautifully fitted to its purpose and the other ill.\n(Xenophon, Book III, viii)\n\n\nBerkeley expresses a similar view in his dialogue Alciphron,\nthough he begins with the hedonist conception: \u201cEvery one knows\nthat beauty is what pleases\u201d (Berkeley 1732, 174; see Carritt\n1931, 75). But it pleases for reasons of usefulness. Thus, as Xenophon\nsuggests, on this view, things are beautiful only in relation to the\nuses for which they are intended or to which they are properly\napplied. The proper proportions of an object depend on what kind of\nobject it is and, again, a beautiful car might make an ugly tractor.\n\u201cThe parts, therefore, in true proportions, must be so related,\nand adjusted to one another, as they may best conspire to the use and\noperation of the whole\u201d (Berkeley 1732, 174\u201375; see\nCarritt 1931, 76). One result of this is that, though beauty remains\ntied to pleasure, it is not an immediate sensible experience. It\nessentially requires intellection and practical activity: one has to\nknow the use of a thing and assess its suitedness to that use.\n\nThis treatment of beauty is often used, for example, to criticize the\ndistinction between fine art and craft, and it avoids sheer\nphilistinism by enriching the concept of \u2018use,\u2019 so that it\nmight encompass not only performing a practical task, but performing\nit especially well or with an especial satisfaction. Ananda\nCoomaraswamy, the Ceylonese-British scholar of Indian and European\nmedieval arts, adds that a beautiful work of art or craft expresses as\nwell as serves its purpose.\n\n\nA cathedral is not as such more beautiful than an airplane, \u2026 a\nhymn than a mathematical equation. \u2026 A well-made sword is not\nless beautiful than a well-made scalpel, though one is used to slay,\nthe other to heal. Works of art are only good or bad, beautiful or\nugly in themselves, to the extent that they are or are not well and\ntruly made, that is, do or do not express, or do or do not serve their\npurpose. (Coomaraswamy 1977, 75)\n\n\nRoger Scruton, in his book Beauty (2009) returns to a\nmodified Kantianism with regard to both beauty and sublimity, enriched\nby many and varied examples. \u201cWe call something\nbeautiful,\u201d writes Scruton, \u201cwhen we gain pleasure from\ncontemplating it as an individual object, for its own sake, and in its\npresented form\u201d (Scruton 2009, 26). Despite the\nKantian framework, Scruton, like Sartwell and Nehamas, throws the\nsubjective/objective distinction into question. He compares\nexperiencing a beautiful thing to a kiss. To kiss someone that one\nloves is not merely to place one body part on another, \u201cbut to\ntouch the other person in his very self. Hence the kiss is\ncompromising \u2013 it is a move from one self toward another, and a\nsummoning of the other into the surface of his being\u201d\n(Scruton 2009, 48). This, Scruton says, is a profound pleasure.\n3. The Politics of Beauty\n\nKissing sounds nice, but some kisses are coerced, some pleasures\nobtained at a cost to other people. The political associations of\nbeauty over the last few centuries have been remarkably various and\nremarkably problematic, particularly in connection with race and\ngender, but in other aspects as well. This perhaps helps account for\nthe neglect of the issue in early-to-mid twentieth-century philosophy\nas well as its growth late in the century as an issue in social\njustice movements, and subsequently in social-justice oriented\nphilosophy.\n3.1 Aristocracy and Capital\n\nThe French revolutionaries of 1789 associated beauty with the French\naristocracy and with the Rococo style of the French royal family, as in\nthe paintings of Fragonard: hedonist expressions of wealth and\ndecadence, every inch filled with decorative motifs. Beauty itself\nbecame subject to a moral and political critique, or even to direct\ndestruction, with political motivations (see Levey 1985). And by the early\n20th century, beauty was particularly associated with capitalism\n(ironically enough, considering the ugliness of the poverty and\nenvironmental destruction it often induced). At times even great art\nappeared to be dedicated mainly to furnishing the homes of rich\npeople, with the effect of concealing the suffering they were\ninflicting. In response, many anti-capitalists, including many\nMarxists, appeared to repudiate beauty entirely. And in the aesthetic\npolitics of Nazism, reflected for example in the films of Leni\nRiefenstahl, the association of beauty and right wing politics was\nsealed to devastating effect (see Spotts 2003).\n\nEarly on in his authorship, Karl Marx could hint that the experience\nof beauty distinguishes human beings from all other animals. An animal\n\u201cproduces only under the dominion of immediate physical need,\nwhilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only\ntruly produces in freedom therefrom. Man therefore also forms objects\nin accordance with the laws of beauty\u201d (Marx 1844, 76). But later\nMarx appeared to conceive beauty as \u201csuperstructure\u201d or\n\u201cideology\u201d disguising the material conditions of\nproduction. Perhaps, however, he also anticipated the emergence of new\nbeauties, available to all both as makers and appreciators, in\nsocialism.\n\nCapitalism, of course, uses beauty \u2013 at times with complete\nself-consciousness \u2013 to manipulate people into buying things.\nMany Marxists believed that the arts must be turned from providing\nfripperies to the privileged or advertising that helps make them\nwealthier to showing the dark realities of capitalism (as in the\nAmerican Ashcan school, for example), and articulating an inspiring\nCommunist future. Stalinist socialist realism consciously repudiates\nthe aestheticized beauties of post-impressionist and abstract\npainting, for example. It has urgent social tasks to perform (see Bown\nand Lanfranconi 2012). But the critique tended at times to generalize to\nall sorts of beauty: as luxury, as seduction, as disguise and\noppression. The artist Max Ernst (1891\u20131976), having survived\nthe First World War, wrote this about the radical artists of the early\ncentury: \u201cTo us, Dada was above all a moral reaction. Our rage\naimed at total subversion. A horrible futile war had robbed us of five\nyears of our existence. We had experienced the collapse into ridicule\nand shame of everything represented to us as just, true, and\nbeautiful. My works of that period were not meant to attract, but to\nmake people scream\u201d (quoted in Danto 2003, 49).\n\nTheodor Adorno, in his book Aesthetic Theory, wrote that one\nsymptom of oppression is that oppressed groups and cultures are\nregarded as uncouth, dirty, ragged; in short, that poverty is ugly. It\nis art\u2019s obligation, he wrote, to show this ugliness, imposed on\npeople by an unjust system, clearly and without flinching, rather to\ndistract people by beauty from the brutal realities of\ncapitalism. \u201cArt must take up the cause of what is proscribed as\nugly, though no longer to integrate or mitigate it or reconcile it\nwith its own existence,\u201d Adorno wrote.  \u201cRather, in the\nugly, art must denounce the world that creates and reproduces the ugly\nin its own image\u201d (Adorno 1970, 48\u20139).\n\nThe political entanglements of beauty tend to throw into question\nvarious of the traditional theories. For example, the purity and\ntranscendence associated with the essence of beauty in the realm of\nthe Forms seems irrelevant, as beauty shows its centrality to politics\nand commerce, to concrete dimensions of oppression. The austere\nformalism of the classical conception, for example, seems neither here\nnor there when the building process is brutally exploitative.\n3.2 The Feminist Critique\n\nAs we have seen, the association of beauty with the erotic is\nproverbial from Sappho and is emphasized relentlessly by figures such\nas Burke and Nehamas. But the erotic is not a neutral or universal\nsite, and we need to ask whose sexuality is in play in the history of\nbeauty, with what effects. This history, particularly in the West and\nas many feminist theorists and historians have emphasized, is\nassociated with the objectification and exploitation of women.\nFeminists beginning in the 19th century gave fundamental critiques of\nthe use of beauty as a set of norms to control women\u2019s bodies or\nto constrain their self-presentation and even their self-image in\nprofound and disabling ways (see Wollstonecraft 1792, Grimk\u00e9\n1837).\n\nIn patriarchal society, as Catherine MacKinnon puts it, the content of\nsexuality \u201cis the gaze that constructs women as objects for male\npleasure. I draw on pornography for its form and content,\u201d she\ncontinues, describing her treatment of the subject, \u201cfor the\ngaze that eroticizes the despised, the demeaned, the accessible, the\nthere-to-be-used, the servile, the child-like, the passive, and the\nanimal. That is the content of sexuality that defines gender\nfemale in this culture, and visual thingification is its method\u201d\n(MacKinnon 1987, 53\u20134). Laura Mulvey, in \u201cVisual Pleasure\nand Narrative Cinema,\u201d reaches one variety of radical critique\nand conclusion: \u201cIt is said that analyzing pleasure, or beauty,\ndestroys it. That is the intention of this article\u201d (Mulvey\n1975, 60).\n\nMulvey\u2019s psychoanalytic treatment was focused on the scopophilia\n(a Freudian term denoting neurotic sexual pleasure configured around\nlooking) of Hollywood films, in which men appeared as protagonists,\nand women as decorative or sexual objects for the pleasure of the male\ncharacters and male audience-members. She locates beauty \u201cat the\nheart of our oppression.\u201d And she appears to have a hedonist\nconception of it: beauty engenders pleasure. But some pleasures, like\nsome kisses, are sadistic or exploitative at the individual and at the\nsocietal level. Art historians such as Linda Nochlin (1988) and\nGriselda Pollock (1987) brought such insights to bear on the history\nof painting, for example, where the scopophilia is all too evident in\nfamous nudes such as Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino or\nVelazquez\u2019s Rokeby Venus, which a feminist slashed with\nknife in 1914 because \u201cshe didn\u2019t like the way men gawked\nat it\u201d.\n\nFeminists such as Naomi Wolf in her book The Beauty Myth,\ngeneralized such insights into a critique of the ways women are\nrepresented throughout Western popular culture: in advertising, for\nexample, or music videos. Such practices have the effect of\nconstraining women to certain acceptable ways of presenting themselves\npublicly, which in turn greatly constrains how seriously they are\ntaken, or how much of themselves they can express in public space. As\nhave many other commentators, Wolf connects the representation of the\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d female body, in Western high art but\nespecially in popular culture, to eating disorders and many other\nself-destructive behaviors, and indicates that a real overturning of\ngender hierarchy will require deeply re-construing the concept of\nbeauty.\n\nThe demand on women to create a beautiful self-presentation by male\nstandards, Wolf argues, fundamentally compromises women\u2019s action\nand self-understanding, and makes fully human relationships between\nmen and women difficult or impossible. In this Wolf follows, among\nothers, the French thinker Luce Irigaray, who wrote that \u201cFemale\nbeauty is always considered as finery ultimately designed to attract\nthe other into the self. It is almost never perceived as a\nmanifestation of, an appearance of, a phenomenon expressive of\ninteriority \u2013 whether of love, of thought, of flesh. We look at\nourselves in the mirror to please someone, rarely to\ninterrogate the state of our body or our spirit, rarely for ourselves\nand in search of our becoming\u201d (quoted in Robinson 2000,\n230).\n\n\u201cSex is held hostage by beauty,\u201d Wolf remarks, \u201cand\nits ransom terms are engraved in girls\u2019 minds early and deeply\nwith instruments more beautiful that those which advertisers or\npornographers know how to use: literature, poetry, painting, and\nfilm\u201d (Wolf 1991f, 157).\n3.3 Colonialism and Race\n\nEarly in the 20th century, black nationalist leader Marcus Garvey\n(1887\u20131940) described European or white standards of beauty as a\ndeep dimension of oppression, quite similarly to the way Naomi Wolf\ndescribes beauty standards for women. These standards are relentlessly\nreinforced in authoritative images, but they are incompatible with\nblack skin, black bodies, and also traditional African ways of\nunderstanding human beauty. White standards of beauty, Garvey argued,\ndevalue black bodies. The truly oppressive aspects of such norms can\nbe seen in the way they induce self-alienation, as Wolf argues with\nregard to sexualized images of women. \u201cSome of us in America,\nthe West Indies, and Africa believe that the nearer we approach the\nwhite man in color, the greater our social standing and\nprivilege,\u201d he wrote (Garvey 1925 [1986], 56). He condemns skin\nbleaching and hair straightening as ways that black people are taught\nto devalue themselves by white standards of beauty. And he connects\nsuch standards to \u2018colorism\u2019 or prejudice in the\nAfrican-American community toward darker-skinned black people.\n\nSuch observations suggest some of the strengths of cultural relativism\nas opposed to subjectivism or universalism: standards of beauty appear\nin this picture not to be idiosyncratic to individuals, nor to be\nuniversal among all people, but to be tied to group identities and to\noppression and resistance.\n\nIn his autobiography, Malcolm X (1925\u20131965), whose parents were\nactivists in the Garvey movement, describes \u2018conking\u2019 or\nstraightening his hair with lye products as a young man. \u201cThis\nwas my first really big step toward self-degradation,\u201d he\nwrites, \u201cwhen I endured all of that pain, literally burning my\nflesh to have it look like a white man\u2019s hair. I had joined that\nmultitude of Negro men and women in America who are brainwashed into\nbelieving that black people are \u2018inferior\u2019 \u2013 and\nwhite people \u2018superior\u2019 \u2013 that they will even\nviolate and mutilate their God-created bodies to try to look\n\u2018pretty\u2019 by white standards\u201d (X 1964,\n56\u20137). For both Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X, a key moment in the\ntransformation of racial oppression would be the affirmation of\nstandards of black beauty that are not parasitic on white standards,\nand hence not directly involved in racial oppression. This was\nsystematically developed after Malcolm\u2019s death in the\n\u201cnatural\u201d hairstyles and African fabrics in the Black\nPower movement. Certainly, people have many motivations for\nstraightening or coloring their hair, for example. But the critical\nexamination of the racial content of beauty norms was a key moment in\nblack liberation movements, many of which, around 1970, coalesced\naround the slogan Black is beautiful. These are critiques of\nspecific standards of beauty; they are also tributes to beauty\u2019s\npower.\n\nImposing standards of beauty on non-Western cultures, and, in\nparticular, misappropriating standards of beauty and beautiful objects\nfrom them, formed one of the most complex strategies of colonialism.\nEdward Said famously termed this dynamic \u201corientalism.\u201d\nNovelists such as Nerval and Kipling and painters such as Delacroix\nand Picasso, he argued, used motifs drawn from Asian and African\ncultures, treating them as \u201cexotic\u201d insertions into\nWestern arts. Such writers and artists might even have understood\nthemselves to be celebrating the cultures they depicted in pictures of\nArabian warriors or African masks. But they used this imagery\nprecisely in relation to Western art history. They distorted what they\nappropriated.\n\n\u201cBeing a White Man, in short,\u201d writes Said, \u201cwas a\nvery concrete manner of being-in-the-world, a way of taking hold of\nreality, language, and thought. It made a specific style\npossible\u201d (Said 1978, 227). This style might be encapsulated in\nthe outfits of colonial governors, and their mansions. But it was also\ntypified by an appropriative \u201cappreciation\u201d of\n\u201csavage\u201d arts and \u201cexotic\u201d beauties, which\nwere of course not savage or exotic in their own context.  Even in\ncases where the beauty of such objects was celebrated, the\nappreciation was mixed with condescension and misapprehension, and\nalso associated with stripping colonial possessions of their most\nbeautiful objects (as Europeans understood beauty)\u2014shipping them\nback to the British Museum, for example.  Now some beautiful objects,\nlooted in colonialism, are being returned to their points of origin\n(see Matthes 2017), but many others remain in dispute.\n3.4 Beauty and Resistance\n\nHowever, if beauty has been an element in various forms of oppression,\nit has also been an element in various forms of resistance, as the\nslogan \u201cBlack is beautiful\u201d suggests. The most compelling\nresponses to oppressive standards and uses of beauty have given rise\nto what might be termed counter-beauties. When fighting\ndiscrimination against people with disabilities, for example, one may\ndecry the oppressive norms that regard disabled bodies as ugly and\nleave it at that. Or one might try to discover what new standards of\nbeauty and subversive pleasures might arise in the attempt to regard\ndisabled bodies as beautiful (Siebers 2005). For that matter, one\nmight uncover the ways that non-normative bodies and subversive\npleasures actually do fulfill various traditional criteria of\nbeauty. Indeed, for some decades there has been a disability arts\nmovement, often associated with artists such as Christine Sun Kim and\nRiva Lehrer, which tries to do just that (see Siebers 2005).\n \nThe exploration of beauty, in some ways flipping it over into an\ninstrument of feminist resistance, or showing directly how\nwomen\u2019s beauty could be experienced outside of patriarchy, has\nbeen a theme of much art by women of the 20th and 21st\ncenturies. Georgia O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s flowers and Judy\nChicago\u2019s \u201cDinner Party\u201d place settings undertake to\nabsorb and reverse the objectifying gaze. The exploration of the\nmeaning of the female body in the work of performance artists such as\nHannah Wilke, Karen Finley, and Orlan, tries both to explore the\nobjectification of the female body and to affirm women\u2019s\nexperience in its concrete realities from the inside: to make of it\nemphatically a subject rather than an object (see Striff 1997).\n\n\u201cBeauty seems in need of rehabilitation today as an impulse that\ncan be as liberating as it has been deemed enslaving,\u201d wrote\nphilosopher Peg Zeglin Brand in 2000. \u201cConfident young women\ntoday pack their closets with mini-skirts and sensible suits. Young\nfemale artists toy with feminine stereotypes in ways that make their\nfeminist elders uncomfortable. They recognize that \u2026 beauty can\nbe a double-edged sword \u2013 as capable of destabilizing rigid\nconventions and restrictive behavioral models as it is of reinforcing\nthem\u201d (Brand 2000, xv). Indeed, vernacular norms of beauty as\nexpressed in media and advertising have shifted in virtue of the\nfeminist and anti-racist attacks on dominant body norms, as the\nconcept\u2019s long journey continues. \n",
