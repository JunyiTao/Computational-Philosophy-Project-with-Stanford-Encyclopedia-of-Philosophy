    "main_text": "Metaethics and Experimental Moral Philosophy\n4. Metaethics and Experimental Moral Philosophy\n\nMetaethics steps back from moral theorizing to ask about the nature\nand function of morality. While first-order ethics seeks to explain\nwhat we should do, metaethics seeks to explain the status of those\ntheories themselves: what are their metaphysical commitments, and what\nevidence do we have for or against them? Which epistemology best\ncharacterizes our moral practices? What is the correct semantics for\nmoral language? These questions might not seem obviously empirical,\nbut insofar as it attempts to give an account of moral semantics,\nepistemology, and ontology, metaethics aims, in part, to capture or\nexplain what we do when we engage in moral talk, judgment, and\nevaluation. To the extent that metaethics sees itself as\ncharacterizing our ordinary practice of morality, it is therefore\nanswerable to empirical data about that practice. To the extent that a\ntheory claims that we are mistaken or in widespread error about the\nmeaning of moral language, or that we lack justification for our core\nmoral beliefs, this is taken to be a strike against that theory. For\nexample, relativism is often criticized on the grounds that it\nrequires us to give up the (putatively) widespread belief that moral\nclaims concern objective matters of fact and are true or false\nindependently of our beliefs or attitudes. We have already seen\nseveral ways that experimental data bears on theories about moral\nreasons (the debate between internalists and externalists) and the\nepistemology of moral judgment (the debate over the role of\nintuitions). In this section we will examine experimental\ncontributions to the debate over moral realism, arguments about moral\ndisagreement, and moral language.\n",
