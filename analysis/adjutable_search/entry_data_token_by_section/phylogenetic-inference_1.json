Yet,\nphylogenetics proceeded without much in the way of underlying theory\nor explicable methodology\u2014rather, the systematist with extensive\nknowledge of some group simply relied on their judgment as to which\ncharacter traits looked genuinely homologous and which character\ntransformations seemed plausible. Some phylogenies were widely agreed\nupon due to the fact that when homologies are clear, inference is\neasy. As early as the late 1800s, there was a general consensus among\nsystematists around the branching order of many of the groups\npresented in\n Figure 1.\n However, the relative placement of the coelacanth and lungfish was\ndisputed almost immediately upon discovery of the former in 1938\n(Thomson 1991)\u2014a dispute that has continued to draw attention\nfrom biologists (e.g., Bockmann, De Carvalho, & De Carvalho 2013;\nAmemiya et al. 2013; Takezaki & Nishihara 2017).\n\nThe lungfish and the coelacanth appear key to understanding the\norigins of the tetrapods, which has remained a major question in the\nreconstruction of evolutionary history since Darwin. But this is just\none example among many. Bowler (1996) surveys the development of\nphylogenetics over this time period and examines a number of these\ndebates in more detail such as whether the arthropods form a\nmonophyletic group, and the question of the origin of birds, and, in\nparticular, how they are related to the extinct dinosaurs.\n\nWhile there are still important disagreements regarding phylogenies,\nthe nature of these disputes have changed substantially as\nphylogeneticists no longer rely largely on individual expert judgment.\nThe mid-twentieth century saw the introduction of competing accounts\nof the theoretical foundations of systematics\n (\u00a71.2.1),\n a flurry of new algorithmic methods for constructing phylogenies and\ntaxonomic classifications, and the beginning of relatively easy access\nto and employment of computational power\n (\u00a71.2.3),\n all combined with new sources of evidence in the form of various\nkinds of molecular data\n (\u00a71.2.2).\n As biologists sought to incorporate these emerging features into\nphylogenetic method and theory, debates arose over how (or whether)\nthis fundamentally changed the nature of systematics. At the same\ntime, debates about the foundations of systematics and the proper\nmethods for classification and taxonomy became highly prevalent and\ninterwoven with arguments about these new methods and newly available\ndata.\n\nTraditionally, the emergence of phylogenetics has been presented\nlargely in the context of debates between three major schools of\ntwentieth century taxonomic thought, often called \u201cThe\nSystematics Wars\u201d\n (\u00a71.2.1).\n As centrally important as this was, a singular focus on that history\nrisks overshadowing the impact of the molecular revolution\n (\u00a71.2.2)\n and ever-increasing access to greater computing power\n (\u00a71.2.3)\n on the establishment of phylogenetics. Below we consider how each of\nthese twentieth century developments impacted the emergence of\nphylogenetics as a distinct field of research. Yet, there are many\noverlapping themes cross-cutting these developments (often reinforced\nby allegiances between individual researchers), suggesting that,\nultimately, an integrated approach is needed for a rich, nuanced\nhistory of phylogenetics.\n1.2.1 The Systematics Wars\n\nHistorically, phylogenetics emerged out of the larger field of\nbiological systematics, the field of biology that studies the\ndiversity of life and the relationships of living things through time.\nToday, systematists typically treat \u201crelatedness\u201d solely\nin terms of recency of common ancestry, but this was not always the\ncase. Pre-Darwinian taxonomists discussed the relationships of various\ngroups and their place in the \u201cnatural system\u201d, and while\nthe rise of evolutionary theory allowed that one sense of relatedness\nwas genealogical, it did not eliminate the idea of the broader notion.\nDebates about the role of phylogeny in classification and taxonomy\nwere widespread (e.g., Huxley [ed.] 1940; Winsor 1995) though they\nbegan to take on a new form beginning in the late 1950s as\ncollaborations turned into organized research programs pushing their\nagendas.\n\nIn his analysis of the period, David Hull (1988: ch. 5) titled one of\nhis chapters \u201cSystematists at War\u201d and thus the name\n\u201cThe Systematics Wars\u201d is sometimes used to describe the\ndebates of the period. Hull (1970) influentially compared three\n\u201ccontemporary systematic philosophies\u201d, typically called\npheneticism, (or numerical taxonomy, after the\nseminal Sokal & Sneath (1963) textbook of the same name),\ncladistics or phylogenetic systematics (after\nHennig\u2019s 1966 foundational text, an earlier version of which was\npublished in German in 1950), and evolutionary systematics\n(following the lead of proponents like Simpson [1961] and Mayr [1969]\nand others).\n\nThe pheneticists disputed that we were in a position to know common\nancestry with enough certainty to justify adopting it as foundational\nto our notion of \u201crelatedness\u201d, and maintained that the\ntaxonomists\u2019 job was discovering clusters of similarity (Sokal\n& Sneath 1963). Pheneticists were critical of what they viewed as\nthe entrenched approach to systematics, arguing that the traditional\napproach to selecting between hypotheses largely relied on the\nrelative prominence or status of the biologist rather than good\nscientific methodology. They explicitly framed their views in the\ncontext of arguments about what constituted \u201cgood science\u201d\nand sought to promote independent and objective modes of assessing\ncompeting taxonomic groupings that relied on transparent and\nrepeatable methods. This included advocating for a greater separation\nbetween biological theory and the construction of similarity\ngroups.\n\nAround the same time, another group (phylogenetic systematists)\ninsisted that recency of common ancestry provided the best\ntheoretically-motivated foundation for relatedness (Hennig 1966). Like\nthe pheneticists, they too sought to promote good scientific methods\nin systematics, and were similarly critical of established approaches.\nThe phylogenetic systematists can be characterized by their insistence\nthat all taxonomic groups above the species level should be\nmonophyletic. Thus, if birds are descended from dinosaurs then they\nare dinosaurs (Padian & Horner 2002). If the dinosaurs\n(or the reptiles more generally) are defined in a way that excludes\nbirds, then the group is paraphyletic and thus cannot be a taxon in a\nphylogenetic taxonomic system. Ernst Mayr derisively named them\n\u201ccladists\u201d for their obsessive focus on recovering clades\n(i.e., monophyletic groups) (Mayr 1965a), though its practitioners\nwere happy to embrace the name. When consistently carried out,\nphylogenetic taxonomic principles led to major revisions in\nlong-standing, traditional classifications\u2014revisions that often\ngenerated deep controversy (e.g., Halstead 1978; Gardiner et al.\n1979).\n\nBoth pheneticism and cladism were developed in opposition to\nentrenched views in systematics. In response, biologists committed to\nmore traditional methods sought to articulate the theoretical\nunderpinnings of their approach, which came to be known as\nevolutionary systematics. With Ernst Mayr as their most prominent\nadvocate, evolutionary systematists sought to incorporate phylogeny\ninto classifications, but permitted that classifications might also\n(or even instead) represent important adaptive differences between\ngroups (Simpson 1961; Mayr 1969). A prominent example that regularly\nfeatured in these debates is the taxonomic placement of the birds and\ncrocodiles. Mayr argued that though birds are descended from dinosaurs\nand reptiles more generally, birds share a cluster of adaptations\nwhich justify classifying them as a distinctive group at a\ntaxonomically equivalent rank as reptiles. However, even though\ncrocodiles are more closely related to birds than to lizards and thus\nbelong to a clade with birds that lizards are not a part of, Mayr\nstill classifies crocodiles as part of the reptile\n\u201cgrade\u201d\u2014a group characterized by a well integrated\nadaptive complex (Mayr 1974). Thus unlike the cladists, evolutionary\nsystematists advocated for the inclusion of reptiles and other\nparaphyletic groups in taxonomy.\n\nOne natural way to understand these debates is to recognize them as\nsystematists sorting out \u201creconstructing a phylogeny\u201d and\n\u201cclassifying a group of taxa\u201d as two distinct tasks, and\nworking out how (if at all) these tasks ought to be reciprocally\ninformative (Mayr 1965a, 1974; Griffiths 1974; Hennig 1975; de Queiroz\n& Gauthier 1990, 1992). With respect to this particular issue,\ncladistics has largely won; today when scientists designate higher\ntaxa they are typically always describing monophyletic groups. The\nprinciple of monophyly has proven to be such a powerful explanatory\nand organizing tool that the commitment to it has grown widely and now\ndominates systematics\u2013in addition to informing both theory and\nmethodology across fields of biology This is one reason why this\nperiod is sometimes referred to as \u201cThe Cladistic\nRevolution\u201d (Hull 1988; Kearney 2007; Haber 2009).\n\nYet, another framing is available. Namely, that as biologists shifted\nto using phylogenies (rather than traditional taxonomies) to support\ntheir explanations and justify their inferences, disagreements over\ntaxonomic classifications faded into the background. On this account,\nit is disagreements over phylogenetic hypotheses that are impactful;\ndisputes over classifications become less consequential as they get\nreplaced in scientific inference by phylogenies. Joseph Felsenstein\n(2004: 145) dubs this the \u201cIt-Doesn\u2019t-Matter-Very-Much\nschool\u201d, arguing that \u201csystematists \u2018voted with\ntheir feet\u2019 to establish this school, long before I announced\nits existence\u201d. How phylogenetics ought to influence, inform, or\nconstrain taxonomic classifications is still a live debate (see\nEreshefsky 2001 as well as debates over the adoption of the PhyloCode,\namong other debates about phylogenetic taxonomy), though one that is\northogonal to the inference of phylogenies. Contemporary debates on\ntaxonomic classification are largely over how to draw inferences\nfrom phylogenies for classifications; there is very\nlittle dispute over the coherency of reconstructing phylogenies.\nBiological classification, on this account, is not viewed as a\ncompetitor to phylogenetics, but dependent on it\u2014and not the\nother way around. Phylogeneticists, like Felsenstein, can largely\nproceed in reconstructing phylogenies without paying attention to\nclassificatory questions, though some of the metaphysical questions\nabout the units of phylogenetics can come back to impact the inference\nof phylogeny itself (see\n \u00a72.6.2)\n\nAs an important aside, we say \u2018largely\u2019 in the previous\nparagraph because\u2014as in many cases in biology\u2014there is not\nunanimity. Notably, biologists that identify as pattern\ncladists would dispute many of the chacterizations we have\noffered about phylogenetics, including the very first sentence of this\nentry, i.e., \u201ca phylogeny is a reconstruction of evolutionary\nhistory.\u201d Though there are a number of views that might be\nidentified with pattern cladism, all would typically regard that claim\nas unjustifiably reading a process into what is largely a claim about\npatterns only. On pattern cladism, phylogenetic trees are typically\nregarded as graphical representations of evidence from characters; in\nthat regard, a phylogeny would just be a classification of those\ncharacters. For the pattern cladist, directly inferring process or\nevolutionary history from phylogenies\u2014or, worse, building\nevolutionary process assumptions into phylogenetic inference\u2014is\na mistake. They defend this for numerous reasons, often on\nphilosophical grounds, i.e., that pattern cladism embodies good\nscientific inference, or that evolutionary claims require additional\ninferential steps that need to be made explicit (Farris 1983). This\nhas contributed to a split in the larger cladistics community. One\nupshot of this process/pattern split is that the term\n\u2018cladist\u2019 has become ambiguous, contested, and imprecise,\nand it is not always clear who gets regarded as what kind of cladist\n(Carpenter 1987, The Editors 2016, Quinn 2017, Brower 2018a, Williams\nand Ebach 2018). For example, while pattern cladists reject any a\npriori assumptions about evolution (Brower 2019), so-called\nprocess (or, sometimes, phylogenetic)\ncladists regard evolutionary claims as foundational to\nphylogenetics, while others (e.g., statistical\nphylogeneticists) have distanced themselves from using\n\u2018cladist\u2019 as a label altogether (see\n \u00a72.3\n and the subsection\n \u00a72.3.1\n for more on this disputed taxonomy). We recommend that philosophers\nwriting in this area carefully specify the precise sense of\n\u2018cladist/m\u2019, if they use that term at all, and caution\nagainst using it interchangeably with \u2018phylogenetics\u2019.\n\nPhilosophers have largely focused on other topics in systematics than\nthe pattern/process split. This is somewhat surprising as there are\nrich philosophical topics that could be fruitfully unpacked or drawn\non as data by philosophers of science, especially for those interested\nin the nature of scientific explanation and inference, or the role of\ntheory in biological methodology. For foundational literature on\nprocess versus pattern cladism see Beatty\u2019s (1982) introduction\nof the designation of pattern cladism, with responses by Brady (1982),\nPatterson (1982), and Platnick (1982). Two good recent pattern cladist\ntextbooks include Williams & Ebach (2020) and Brower & Schuh\n(2021). There is an expansive though well contained literature within\ncladistics featuring debates between pattern and process cladists,\ne.g., Carpenter (1987), Brower (2000, 2002, 2019), and Lee (2002) are\njust a very small selection of a large literature that philosophers\ninterested in the justification of scientific inference and methology\nmight explore.\n\nRegardless of whether disputes about taxonomic philosophy died down\nbecause systematists came to agree or because they became less\nimportant, it is a mistake for philosophers to treat the Systematics\nWars as a live dispute, as opposed to an historical one. Yet, it\nremains an important episode in the history of systematics, and the\ncore conceptual debates left their mark on contemporary debates in\nphylogenetics (Haber 2009). At stake was not merely what notion of\n\u201crelatedness\u201d systematists ought to adopt, but what\nconstituted good science in the context of inferring history and\nconstructing classifications, and the relative value (and even\ncoherence) of concepts like objectivity, testability, and\nrepeatability in science. But systematists no longer dispute\nwhether phylogenetic inference may be justified as a\nscientific activity, but, rather, over how best to carry it out. A\nlarge part of why this change took place has to do with the\navailability of new sources of molecular data and the introduction of\nnew methods to take advantage of it. It is to this history that we now\nturn.\n1.2.2 The Molecular Revolution\n\nLike Felsenstein, Sterner and Lidgard (2018) encourage historians and\nphilosophers of biology to \u201cmove past the systematics\nwars\u201d. Their point is not that this was unimportant, but that a\nsingular focus on it tends to overshadow the impact of other important\nhistorical advances during this period. We agree. To remedy this,\nSterner and Lidgard suggest paying attention to the practice\nof systematists in this period, rather than more narrowly focusing on\ndefinitional disputes (embodying the so-called philosophy of science\nin practice approach (Ankeny, Chang, Boumans, & Boon 2011)). Doing\nso reveals that alongside the Systematics Wars were the dual\nmethodological revolutions of the mathematization of systematics and\nthe incorporation of molecular data. These trends cut across the\nseparate schools of systematics, generating their own set of\ncontroversies. This is particularly acute in phylogenetics, where the\nrise of the use of mathematical and computational tools was both\nenthusiastically embraced and deeply resisted. We start with a short\ndescription of the impact of molecular data on phylogenetics, before\nmoving to how mathematical and statistical tools were incorporated\ninto phylogenetic methods in\n section 1.2.3\n (for other histories on these topics see Dietrich 1994, 1998; Hagen\n2001; Sterner & Lidgard 2018).\n\nLet\u2019s first consider the appeal of including molecular data in\nphylogenetic analyses\u2014perhaps even to the exclusion of\nmorphological characters (e.g., Scotland, Olmstead, & Bennett 2003\nthough see Wiens 2004). One of the most important aspects of the\nmolecular revolution for phylogenetics was the sheer amount of new\ndata available to systematists, including for groups such as bacteria,\nwhere fossil data were scarce or severely lacking. Yet it was not\nmerely the scale and availability of molecular data that held such\nappeal. As it became easier to collect, code, and collate these data,\nbiologists argued that molecular phylogenetics provided an independent\nsource of evidence from morphological studies that bolstered evidence\nfor common ancestry and patterns of phylogeny (Zuckerkandl &\nPauling 1965). In contrast, more traditional systematists such as\nTheodosius Dobzhanksy, Ernst Mayr and George Gaylord Simpson were\nskeptical of molecular evolution studies quite generally, and, in\nparticular, the idea that they were in some way superior or could\nreplace morphological studies (Dietrich 1998).\n\nMany of the earliest molecular studies typically supported established\nphylogenies, e.g., Margoliash (1963) discusses the evolution of\ncytochrome c, though simply presumes the received phylogeny\nof species as correct. Later, Fitch & Margoliash (1967) construct\na phylogeny solely from the cytochrome c data, primarily to\ndemonstrate molecular phylogenetic methods and how to test the\nreliability of results. Interestingly, one of the\n\u201canomalies\u201d they mention is that turtles are placed closer\nto birds than to snakes\u2014but this turns out to be no anomaly! The\nvast majority of molecular studies have since placed the turtles as a\nsister group to the archosaurs (a group which includes the birds and\nthe crocodiles) including the largest genome-scale studies done to\ndate (Crawford et al. 2015).\n\nThe case of the phylogeny of turtles as well as other recent molecular\nstudies (e.g., of the lungfish and the coelacanth, see Amemiya et al.\n2013; Takezaki & Nishihara 2017) illustrate a general point. Even\nin groups where we have extensive fossils and easily accessible living\nspecimens with detailed anatomical and morphological studies,\nmolecular evidence has often been taken to settle disputes and even to\noverturn previously widely held views. This is in part due to the\nsheer volume of molecular data, which can overwhelm other sources of\nevidence, but also because of the way molecular data may be viewed as\nevolving \u201cneutrally\u201d, i.e., as the result of mutation and\ngenetic drift rather than natural selection (Duret 2008), and, thus,\nbe less prone to displaying analogies (the result of\nconvergent evolution), which can be mistaken for homologies\n(the result of descent from common ancestry). (An analogy is the\nsimilarity relation between two analogous characters, and is a kind of\n\u201chomoplasy\u201d relation, i.e., characters whose similarity is\nnot due to descent from common ancestors.)\n\nAnalogies are false positives of evidence of common ancestry.\nMorphological traits, it is presumed, are more subject to selective\npressures that can generate these false positives, and so molecular\ndata from sources less subject to selective pressures (i.e., neutral\nsites) are preferable for reconstructing phylogenetic history. From\nthose phylogenies, analogies can be better identified, offering\nevidence for appeals to natural selection (in the form of convergent\nevolution or other evolutionary processes) as an explanation for the\npattern of biodiversity and trait distribution (Whittall & Hodges\n2007 provides a good example of this reasoning in regard to pollinator\nmode and morphology). Put another way, molecular data helps biologists\nexplain why what appear to be homologies fail to form nested\nhierarchies. Molecular data can identify which of those might be\nanalogies instead, and this helps resolve what would otherwise appear\nto be conflicts in phylogenetic inference. This is one way biologists\nuse phylogenies to offer data-driven, theoretically-grounded\nevolutionary explanations, in contrast to \u201cjust-so\u201d\nstories.\n\nIn addition to adding more evidence in cases where systematists\nalready had a great deal of it, molecular studies can shed light on\ncases where other sources of evidence are extremely weak. For example,\nmolecular data may preserve deep phylogenetic history otherwise\nobscured at the morphological level by millions of years of adaptive\nchanges. Phylogeneticists depicting the very earliest branches in\nplant and animal phylogenies, as well as relationships between the\ndifferent groups of eukaryotes, recognized how molecular data could\nboth test and enrich these deep phylogenetic hypotheses (Kenrick &\nCrane 1997; Baldauf 2003). Subsequent molecular phylogentic analyses\nhave demonstrated the fruitfulness of using molecular data (e.g.,\namino acid sequences, RNA transcriptomes, and nuclear and\nmitochondrial genomes) for constructing deep phylogeny hypotheses\n(Heckman et al. 2001; Dunn, Giribet, Edgecombe, & Hejnol\n2014).\n\nEmile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling\u2019s introduction and use of\nthe hypothesis of a molecular clock provides a good example of the\npowerful utility of molecular data and was an important early episode\nin the history of molecular phylogenetics. The term \u201cmolecular\nclock\u201d was coined in Zuckerkandl & Pauling (1965), but they\nhad already used it without naming it in earlier publications\n(Zuckerkandl & Pauling 1962; Pauling & Zuckerkandl 1963). The\nbasic idea is fairly simple. Given some estimated rate of molecular\nevolution, the relative ages of branches and nodes may be estimated\ngiven some set of molecular data mapped onto a phylogenetic topology.\nThus, molecular models of evolution were incorporated into\nphylogenetic methods\n (\u00a71.2.3).\n\nAs more sequences of proteins became available, Zuckerkandl and\nPauling noted that homologous proteins displayed slight yet\nsystematically different sequences across taxa. For example, while\nthere were 18 amino acid differences between the human and horse\nhemoglobin \u03b1-chains, there was thought to be only two\ndifferences between gorillas and\n humans.[3]\n\nZuckerkandl and Pauling then assumed that amino acid changes were\nroughly linearly proportional to time, and thus the time between the\ndivergence of humans and horses was nine times greater than that\nbetween humans and gorillas. Using paleontological estimates for\ncalibration, Zuckerkandl and Pauling concluded that the humans and\ngorillas diverged a mere 14.5 million years ago\u2014much more recent\nthan traditionally was thought. This line of inference is not limited\nto molecular phylogenetics, but has been imported for application to\nother data types, e.g., similar reasoning from phylogenetic techniques\nhas been applied to language-tree divergence times to estimate\nIndo-European and Polynesian human migration (Gray & Jordan 2000;\nGray & Atkinson 2003; Gray, Drummond, & Greenhill 2009). (For\nmore on the early development of the molecular clock, see Morgan\n1998.)\n\nLater, it was thought that the neutral theory of\n evolution[4]\n provided some theoretical justification for the molecular clock\nhypothesis (Kimura 1968, 1969; Duret 2008), though Dietrich (1994)\nargues that the relationship goes in the other direction with\nZuckerkandl and Pauling\u2019s research providing an essential\nfoundation for the development of the neutral theory in the first\nplace.\n\nThe molecular clock is but one of many examples of the importance of\nmolecular biology to phylogenetics. Importantly, incorporating\nmolecular data helped extend phylogenetic studies beyond eukaryotes,\ni.e., the molecular revolution has fundamentally altered (or,\narguably, created) the field of microbial phylogenetics. Beginning in\n1969, Carl Woese began to sequence ribosomal RNA (rRNA) from across\nthe prokaryotic kingdom in an effort to understand bacterial\nphylogeny. The work was slow and difficult, but by 1975 Woese and his\nlab had sequenced the rRNA of 27 different bacterial taxa (Woese et\nal. 1975). In 1977, Woese and George Fox dropped a bombshell. They had\nsequenced genes from a number of prokaryotic organisms whose rRNA\ngenes lacked the standard signatures of all previously known bacterial\nrRNA genes and which appeared as distantly related to the bacteria as\ndid the eukaryotes. Woese and Fox named them the\n\u201cArchaebacteria\u201d to emphasize their distinctness (Woese\n& Fox 1977). In 1990, Woese, Kandler, and Wheelis (1990) produced\nthe first attempt at building a universal tree of life that included\nbacteria, archaebacteria, and the eukaryotes based on molecular data,\nwith the project continuing to this day (Ciccarelli et al. 2006;\nHinchliff et al. 2015; Hug et al. 2016). All of this is only possible\nbecause of molecular sequence data.\n1.2.3 The Mathematization of Phylogenetics and Introduction of Basic Phylogenetic Methods\n\nThe introduction of molecular data was highly significant in\nphylogenetics. In addition to the amount of data it generated, and the\nway molecular data provided evidence where other data were scarce,\nthis new type of data was also significant in how it promoted the\nmathematization of phylogenetics. Molecular data lends itself to\nmathematical and statistical analysis, in part due to (a) the ease by\nwhich molecular data may be encoded; (b) the systematic way molecular\nevolution may be mathematically modeled and subsequently incorporated\ninto statistical methods; and (c) the manner by which mathematical and\nstatistical tools help analyze the large volume of molecular data\nunder consideration. So though the molecular revolution and\nmathematization of systematics need not go hand-in-hand, it is hardly\nsurprising that they do.\n\nA number of authors have discussed the rise of mathematical thinking\nand computational tools in systematics\u2014especially in connection\nwith numerical taxonomy and phenetic classification (e.g., Hagen 2001;\nSterner & Lidgard 2014, 2018). Here we focus on the rise of\nstatistical methods for inferring phylogenies and later\n (\u00a72)\n we discuss the philosophical debates that arose regarding the use of\nthese methods. Good and more thorough textbook introductions for\nphylogenetic methods include Felsenstein (2004), Lemey et al. (2009)\nand Baum & Smith (2013). Yang and Rannala (2012) provide a helpful\nrecent review in the context of molecular phylogenetics.)\n\nIncorporating molecular data both encourages and is facilitated by the\nadoption of mathematical tools. We got a hint of that in the\ndiscussion of molecular clocks\n (\u00a71.2.2),\n which use estimated rates of molecular evolution to estimate\ndivergence times. Around the same time, Anthony Edwards and Luca\nCavalli-Sforza\u2014both students of R.A. Fisher\u2014began thinking\nof phylogenetic inference as a problem for statistics. After initially\nworking independently on the problem, they collaborated to produce\nwhat are perhaps the first set of papers presenting phylogenetic\ninference in a statistical framework (as attributed by (Felsenstein\n2001, 2004); Edwards\u2019 own recollections of this work can be\nfound in Edwards (1996)).\n\nAmong the earliest algorithmic methods for inferring phylogenies are\nthose known as \u201cdistance\u201d methods. \u201cDistance\u201d\ncould represent whichever character coding scheme we might be using to\nconstruct the tree, molecular or morphological, e.g., the number of\nnucleotide differences between two sampled sequences of DNA. A\ndistance method uses these pair-wise distances to infer the\nphylogeny.\n\nThe first distance method developed is among the best justified\nstatistically, namely, the least-squares method of\nCavalli-Sforza and Edwards (1967). Here each topology has a set of\n\u201cbest-fitting\u201d branch lengths where fit is measured by\nsumming the squared differences between the expected distance and the\nactual distance between each pair of taxa. The best tree topology is\nthe one whose best fit branch lengths are a better fit than any other\ntree\u2019s best fit.\n\nAn alternative class of methods are known as parsimony methods. Here\nwe simply need a measure of how many steps it takes for one character\nstate to transform into another. Recall that different tree hypotheses\ngenerate different explanations of the current character\ndistributions. The basic idea behind parsimony is that the tree\nhypothesis that explains these character distributions with the fewest\nnumber of evolutionary changes is to be preferred.\n\nThe first parsimony algorithm was published in Camin and Sokal (1965)\nand a number of variants of parsimony have since been developed. For\nexample, one might want to weight certain kinds of changes relative to\nothers or even disallow certain kinds of changes (such as reversals)\nall together. A survey of such methods as well as a collection of\ndifferent algorithms for carrying them out can be found in Felsenstein\n(2004). Parsimony was the chosen method for the Cladistic school which\nis part of the reason that the history sketched in \u201cThe\nSystematics Wars\u201d\n (\u00a71.2.1)\n above is intertwined with the history of mathematization sketched\nhere. Philosophical arguments for and against the superiority of\nparsimony as an inference method will be discussed later in\n section 2.3.\n\nIf we think of phylogenetic inference as an instance of statistical\ninference more generally, then likelihood and Bayesian methods spring\nto mind as methods that exemplify more general, statistical paradigms.\nBoth require calculating probabilities and thus will require models of\nevolutionary change i.e., some description of the process of evolution\nand assignment of probabilities to possible changes in character\nstates (such as from one nucleotide to another). Let\u2019s briefly\nwalk through what that means, as how and whether to incorporate models\nof evolution in phylogenetic inference has been a major topic of\ndebate.\n\nIf the data are observed nucleotide sequences from different groups of\nterminal taxa, then the calculation we are after is the probability\nthat those observed sequences of nucleotides would arise on the tips\nof competing phylogenetic hypotheses. The simplest way to calculate\nthat is to use the Jukes-Cantor model of evolution (Jukes & Cantor\n1969). This model assumes an equal frequency of the four nucleotides,\nand a uniform probability that any one nucleotide might change to\nanother. (These assumptions are typically violated, but reflecting\nthat in a model of evolution introduces additional parameters, which\nincreases computing time\u2014a valuable and limited resource in\n1969.) The Jukes-Cantor model provides a model of evolution on which\nthe relevant probability that any given sequence might have evolved\nfrom another more primitive sequence may be calculated. Different tree\ntopologies will generate different probabilities that the observed\nsequences evolved from a hypothetical ancestral state. This\nconditional probability, \\(P(\\text{Data} | \\text{Tree})\\), is called\nthe likelihood of the tree.\n\nThough the Jukes-Cantor model is still used, more sophisticated models\nof evolution are available, e.g., the K80 (Kimura 1980), HKY85\n(Hasegawa, Kishino, & Yano 1985) and Tamura-Nei (Tamura & Nei\n1993) models of evolution. These introduce more parameters, e.g.,\nassumptions about equal frequencies of nucleotides and/or the uniform\nprobability of changing nucleotide states may be relaxed and even\ncustomized; models may also incorporate molecular clock\nassumptions.\n\nThese parameter-rich models reflect a better understanding of\nmolecular evolution (e.g., that transversion and\n transition[5]\n rates between nucleotides are rarely equivalent) and the combination\nof lowered costs and increasing accessibility to growing computational\npower that permits more parameter rich analyses. The large number of\nmodels available leads to an interesting statistical problem in its\nown right known as the problem of model selection, i.e., which model\nof evolution do we use in our phylogenetic tools? For discussions of\nthis problem in the context of phylogenetics, see (Posada &\nCrandall 1998; Sullivan & Joyce 2005; Posada 2008).\n\nOnce we choose a model or collection of models to work with, we can\nnow calculate probabilities conditional on these additional parameters\n(\\(\\theta\\)). This likelihood may be formally represented as:\n\n\\[ L(\\text{Tree}, \\theta | \\text{Data}) = P(\\text{Data} | \\text{Tree}, \\theta) \\]\n\n\nAs a reminder, the likelihood of a hypothesis given a set of data is\njust equal to the conditional probability of those data given that\nhypothesis. On these model-based phylogenetic approaches, the data are\nconditional on both a particular phylogenetic tree hypothesis\nand the stipulated parameters.\n\nUsing different values for the parameters in your model will lead to\ndifferent likelihoods for the tree. The maximum likelihood estimate is\nthe tree hypothesis along with the fitted parameters which maximizes\nthis likelihood. Felsenstein (1981) gave the first computationally\nfeasible algorithm for calculating likelihoods, and with modern\ncomputing power combined with the huge amounts of sequence data\navailable, likelihood methods have become the most commonly used\nmethods in phylogenetics.\n\nJust as with likelihood methods, Bayesian methods require a model of\nevolution before any inferences are possible. The fundamental\ndifference is that likelihood inference treats parameters of the model\nas nuisance parameters which have a fixed but unknown value. In the\nfrequentist method of maximum likelihood, these parameters are set to\ntheir best fitting value. Bayesian inference treats parameters as\nrandom variables with unknown distributions and probabilities are used\nas a measure of uncertainty. The probability of a tree is a\nconditional probability \\(P(\\text{Tree} | \\text{Data})\\) under the\nassumption of a particular model. When we incorporate the model\nparameters \\(\\theta\\), by Bayes\u2019 theorem, we have:\n\n\\[P(\\text{Tree}, \\theta | \\text{Data}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Data} | \\text{Tree}, \\theta)*P(\\text{Tree}) }{P(\\text{Data})}.\\]\n\n\nControversially, this requires that we attach prior probabilities to\nthe possible hypotheses as well as the parameters in our model.\nPickett and Randle (2005) claim that it is impossible to assign priors\nin a consistent way. Velasco (2007) argues that this claim rests on a\nmistake, though the problem remains a difficult one. He later\nadvocates assigning priors to tree topologies, but leaves open the\nmore difficult problem of priors on branch lengths or model parameters\n(Velasco 2008b). Alfaro and Holder (2006) attempt to address some of\nthese issues.\n\nAnthony Edwards (1970) was the first to discuss Bayesian methods in\nphylogenetics, but it was computationally impossible to carry these\ninferences out at the time. In the 1990s, three groups independently\ndeveloped methods for carrying out Bayesian inferences of phylogenies\nin practice (Rannala & Yang 1996; Mau & Newton 1997; Yang\n& Rannala 1997; Li, Pearl, & Doss 2000). Each group used\nBayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to estimate\nposterior probabilities, which other groups further refined (e.g.,\nLarget & Simon 1999; An\u00e9, Larget, Baum, Smith, & Rokas\n2007; Huelsenbeck, An\u00e9, Larget, & Ronquist 2008). (See\nArchibald, Mort, & Crawford 2003 for an early and non-technical\nprimer on Bayesian phylogenetic methods.) With further statistical and\ncomputational improvements, Bayesian methods are now fairly\ncommonplace in the literature alongside likelihood methods.\n2. Phylogenetic Inference and Philosophy\n\nSection 1\n served as an introduction to the history and problem of phylogenetic\ninference. In this section, we will look at how phylogenetics and\nphilosophy are intertwined\u2014in particular, we will examine some\nfoundational debates in phylogenetics that have a distinctly\nphilosophical flavor, and we will point out more traditional\nphilosophical questions that the study of phylogenetics can shed light\non.\n\nAt its core, phylogenetic inference is about evaluating competing\nhypotheses. In an important sense, phylogeneticists are faced with\nwhat philosophers of science would identify as a problem of\n underdetermination of theory by evidence\n.\nMultiple competing phylogenetic trees can explain the same data,\nthough in conflicting ways; it is the phylogeneticists task to\nidentify which of those hypotheses best explains those data. It will\nbe useful to separate the problem into two parts:\n\nidentifying what the evidence is; and\nconstructing a phylogeny to explain the evidence we have.\n\n\nIn the case of phylogenetic inference, we are in the philosophically\ninteresting and puzzling situation where it seems that these two\nquestions cannot really be separated.\n2.1 Alignment and Character Coding\n\nThe question of which method of phylogenetic inference is best\njustified is clearly important, but skips over an important step in\nphylogenetic inference\u2014the construction of a data matrix of\ncharacters. Mishler (2005), for one, argues that it is the most\nimportant step! Following Winther (2009), we can separate\ncharacter analysis which results in the construction of a\ndata matrix from phylogenetic analysis which treats the data\nas input and produces a phylogeny. This first stage of character\nanalysis has been widely discussed in biology (though surely less\nwidely discussed than the second stage). In addition to the voluminous\nliterature on homology, useful collections of work on characters\ninclude those edited by Wagner (2000) and Scotland & Pennington\n(2000).\n\nCharacter analysis includes identifying characters of the organisms we\nare looking at, and in particular, identifying when a character in one\norganism is the same character as in another organism. This is the\nproblem of homology. A different, but related problem, is assigning\ncharacter states. For example, one bear might have black fur while\nanother has white fur. Here, \u201cfur\u201d is the character, but\nit is in a different state (fur color) in the two organisms. Though it\nis standard to treat characters and character states separately, the\nextent to which these are genuinely different problems rather than\nthan aspects of the same problem is a matter of debate (Stevens 2000;\nFreudenstein 2005; Sereno 2005).\n\nIdentifying and coding characters is certainly a biological problem,\nbut it is a philosophical one as well. On what basis can we judge that\none character is homologous to another? Debates on this extend back to\nthe very beginning of contemporary biology, e.g., Richard Owen\u2019s\ninfluential pre-Darwinian notion of homologue to Ernst Haeckel working\nto develop accounts of homology in the context of Darwinian evolution.\nIn the mid-twentieth century, the pheneticists argued that character\nidentification must be \u201ctheory-free\u201d and advocated using\nraw similarity as a guide to identifying homology (Sokal & Sneath\n1963; Sneath & Sokal 1973). There are well known philosophical and\nbiological problems with trying to use similarity in this way (e.g.,\nGoodman 1972), many of which were raised as objections to strict\npheneticism during the Systematics Wars (e.g., Mayr 1965b; Neff 1986;\nRieppel & Kearney 2002 though see Lewens 2012 for a recent defense\nof pheneticism in a contemporary context).\n\nIn a phylogenetic context, homologies are regarded as the result of\ndescent with modification from common ancestors. Similarity and\nidentity, in that context, is an expression of shared evolutionary\nhistory. At the same time, homologies are also treated as hypotheses\nfrom which we can infer phylogenetic hypotheses (and, subsequently,\nboth test and explain our hypotheses of homology). Clearly, even in a\ncontemporary phylogenetic context, questions remain on how to\nindividuate characters and identify homologies. Richards (2002, 2003)\nworries that since there is no algorithm for individuating characters,\nwe rely on illegitimate, nonscientific factors rendering character\nidentification and phylogenetic analysis ultimately subjective.\nRieppel and Kearney (2007) and Winther (2009) respond that character\nanalysis can be considered objective since it relies on various kinds\nof causal criteria; Kendig (2016) adopts a slightly different\nstrategy, rejecting the idea that we need to develop an analytic\ndefinition of \u201chomology\u201d, instead looking to biological\npractice as a guide for individuating characters.\n\nWhile character analysis and phylogenetic analysis are logically\nseparate tasks, in theory they should be intertwined. A given\nphylogeny can make an assessment of homology more or less plausible.\nOne proposal to avoid this problem is the introduction of a\ndistinction between \u201cprimary\u201d homologies (an initial\ncharacter identification based on structural features) and\n\u201csecondary\u201d homologies (similarity due to common ancestry)\nwhich are inferred through phylogenetic analysis (Pinna 1991; see\nRoffe 2020 for a recent philosophical treatment of this distinction).\nOn the other hand, Rieppel and Kearney (2002) argue that character\nhypotheses need to be independently testable and phylogenetic analysis\ncan clearly provide evidence for miscoding of characters\u2014even if\nthis is not the intended goal.\n\nMolecular data presents a different set of challenges for\nindividuating characters and coding them into a matrix, nicely\nillustrated by DNA sequence data. With only four base nucleotides,\ncoding is easy\n (\u00a71.2.3),\n and modern laboratory techniques provide highly reliable sequences of\nnucleotides in a stretch of DNA. But here, the problem is\nalignment. How do we know that one stretch of nucleotide\nsequences should correspond to similar stretches in other taxa? We\nmight consider chromosomal location, or even functional similarities,\nthough each of these raise other questions of how we decide what ought\nto be treated as homologous characters (even contingently) across\ntaxa. This becomes even more complicated as we consider how historical\nprocesses like gene duplication/loss or recombination add complexity\nto these questions. This is the problem of positional homology. Like\nmorphological character coding, molecular alignment is intertwined\nwith phylogenetic analysis and various methods of joint inference have\nbeen proposed (Redelings & Suchard 2005; Wheeler et al. 2006).\n2.2 Computational Limits and Big Data\n\nBearing in mind what we said above about the interconnectedness of\ncharacter analysis and phylogenetic analysis, we will now proceed to\nthe second part, analysis of the data. At this stage, computational\nlimits loom large. Even if we are concerned only with inferring the\ntopology of a phylogeny, the number of possible trees grows\nexponentially relative to the number of terminal branches we include\non a tree. The formula for calculating the number of possible tree\ntopologies is relatively straight-forward (Felsenstein 2004):\n\n\\[\\frac{(2n-3)!}{2^{n-2}(n-2)!}\\]\n\n\nwhere n is the number of taxa. The upshot is that even a\nsmall expansion of terminal branches results in an exponential\nincrease in the number of possible topologies. So, for example, there\nare 15 possible phylogenetic trees for a group of 4 species, over 34\nmillion for 10 species, and \\(8 \\times 10^{21}\\) with 20\n species.[6]\n\nThis means that exhaustive evaluation of all possible hypotheses very\nquickly becomes all but impossible\u2014even as our capacity for this\nhas grown with increased computing power. Finding the most\nparsimonious tree, the maximum likelihood tree, and even doing a\nmultiple sequence alignment to begin with are all NP-complete\n problems[7]\n (Graham & Foulds 1982; Wang & Jiang 1994; Chor & Tuller\n2005). Bayesian inference is similarly computationally intractable\n(Ronquist, Mark, & Huelsenbeck 2009).\n\nIn response, researchers have developed heuristic search strategies to\nexplore possible tree space. For example, in Bayesian analysis the\nprobability space of possible trees is so large that starting by\nrandomly selecting a tree will be highly inefficient. It will almost\nsurely fail to provide a good estimate of the posterior probability\ndistribution, since the interesting regions will only occupy a small\npart of that distribution space (Ronquist et al. 2009). A common\nheuristic is to start with a parsimony or distance-methods tree.\nThough these methods typically perform worse than model-based\napproaches, they are much less computationally expensive and can\nquickly generate an initially plausible tree that Bayesian\nphylogeneticists use as a launching off point to explore the tree\nprobability space (e.g., using hill-climbing algorithms such as Markov\nChain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling). Innovations like these are one\nreason that computational phylogenetics is an important field in both\nstatistics and computer science. Philosophers of science interested in\nhow scientists explore and use so-called \u201cBig Data\u201d would\nprofit from examining how phylogeneticists have developed, adapted,\nand employed heuristic search strategies.\n\nSetting aside computational and practical problems leaves us with what\nappears to be a straightforward epistemological question\u2014which\nmethods are best justified in licensing phylogenetic inferences? We\nbegin our examination of this question by looking at arguments in\nfavor of a particular method, parsimony.\n2.3 Justifications of Parsimony\n\nParsimony methods were among the very first adopted by cladists. This\nis often taken to include Hennig (1966), who laid out a process of\nphylogenetic inference that is now referred to as \u201cHennigian\nreasoning\u201d in his seminal text Phylogenetic Systematics\n(Baum & Smith 2013). Like other forms of parsimony, this method\nsought to identify the tree that explained the distribution of\nhomologies by appeal to the fewest number of evolutionary events.\n\nParsimony techniques have grown more sophisticated, and, as larger\ndata sets have been assessed and bigger trees constructed,\njustifications of parsimony approaches advanced and adapted. Early on,\nmuch of this took place in the context of the Systematics Wars\n (\u00a71.2.1),\n where a premium was placed on defending approaches as properly\nscientific. Thus, these debates tended to veer into philosophy of\nscience, with systematists disputing what counted as doing good\nscience in the context of inferring history. This helps explain the\ninfluence of\n Karl Popper\u2019s\n work\n\n. Early\nproponents of parsimony were attracted to Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationist account of the scientific method, both in the way it\nprovided demarcation criteria for scientific activity, and in the way\nit was positioned as critical of\n logical positivist\n\napproaches. Falsificationist justifications were employed to criticize\nnumerical taxonomists as verificationists relying on flawed\nhypothetico-deductive methods.\n\nWiley (1975) provides a representative example of a falsificationist\ndefense of parsimony that proved deeply influential, e.g., Eldredge\n& Cracraft (1980) adopt Wiley\u2019s core justification in their\ninfluential textbook, as does Farris (1983) in his impactful defense\nof parsimony. On Wiley\u2019s account, each taxonomic character is\ntreated as an homology, and considered independently of all others.\nFor each homology, a tree hypothesis is generated that requires the\nfewest number of evolutionary changes to explain the pattern of\ncharacter distribution across taxa. These are hypotheses of homology\nand, on the falsificationist account, these hypotheses are mutually\ntestable. That is, the tree hypotheses generated for each character\nconstitutes a test of the trees hypothesized for every other\ncharacter; falsified hypotheses of homology are treated as ad hoc\nassumptions of homoplasy. The maximum parsimony tree is that topology\nwhich generates the fewest falsified hypotheses of homology, and is\nregarded as the most corroborated tree. Adding new characters or taxa\nconstitutes further testing of these hypotheses, and generates more\npotential falsifiers. In this way, parsimony is simultaneously a mode\nof tree construction and evaluation (Haber 2009); Wiley (1975),\nEldredge and Cracraft (1980), and Farris (1983) describe this as a\nlogical basis of reasoning about phylogenetic inference, citing the\nphilosophical justification of falsificationism.\n\nWhether this represents a faithful account of Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism, or whether falsificationism represents the\noptimal (or even a desirable) mode of scientific reasoning has been a\nmatter taken up by philosophers (Hull 1983, 1999; Sober 1988b), though\nthat is, in some ways, beside the point. (For a philosophically-minded\nbiologist\u2019s survey of the role of Popper in systematics, see\nGaffney 1979, Rieppel 2008, or Santis 2020.) Regardless,\ncharacterizing parsimony in falsificationist terms provided an\nimportant justification that resonates to this day. More recent\ninvocations of Popper in phylogenetic inference have focused on\nwhether parsimony or model-based methods such as Maximum Likelihood\n (\u00a71.2.3)\n better align with falsificationism (e.g., Siddall & Kluge 1997;\nde Queiroz & Poe 2001, 2003; Kluge 2001), and whether\nprobabilistic and statistical reasoning is relevant for studying\nsingular historical events (Siddall & Kluge 1997; Haber 2005).\n(See Turner 2007; Cleland 2011;Currie 2018, 2019, for general\nphilosophy of historical science.) In\n section 2.4\n we describe how Felsenstein\u2019s (1978) discovery that parsimony\nis prone to systematic errors poses a serious challenge to this\nunderlying falsificationist justification.\n\nParsimony can be defended without falsificationism, and other\njustifications have been offered that appeal to the method\u2019s\nnamesake, i.e., the principle of parsimonious reasoning or appeals to\nOckham\u2019s Razor (e.g., Kluge 2005). It amounts to (i) defending\nparsimony (the principle) as the criterion by which we ought to assess\ncompeting phylogenetic hypotheses, and (ii) arguing that parsimony\n(the method) is the best mode for achieving that goal by seeking out\nthat tree that minimizes the number of evolutionary novelties required\nto explain the distribution of characters. This may also be presented\nas identifying that tree that minimizes the number of ad hoc\nassumptions of homoplasy. Though this appeal to simplicity may be\nwedded to falsificationist justifications (as we saw above), they are\nlogically independent defenses. There is certainly an intuitive appeal\nto the principle of parsimony in the sciences, and Ockham\u2019s\nrazor remains influential for good reason. But justifying parsimony\nmethods by appeal to simplicity is not so straight-forward. Evaluating\nwhich phylogenetic approaches are justified by Ockham\u2019s Razor\ndepends on what is being counted (Haber 2009). Sober (1988b, 2015\namong others) provide useful discussions of the role of simplicity and\nthe principle of parsimony in phylogenetics.\n\nOther philosophical justifications of parsimony have been offered.\nFitzhugh (2008 and elsewhere) has argued that the problem of\nphylogenetic inference is best understood as an abductive problem, and\nthat treating it as a problem for statistical (or inductive) inference\namounts to a category error. Sober (1988b) agrees that phylogenetics\ninvolves abductive reasoning, though argues that this\njustifies the use of statistical approaches (especially\nlikelihood).\n\nIt is also worth recalling why pattern cladists in particular object\nto model-based methods of phylogeny reconstruction. Pattern cladists\ntypically reject any method of phylogeny reconstruction that\nincludes assumptions about the evolutionary process (\u00a71.2.1),\ne.g., Brower (2019: 717) identifies a centrral commitment\ndistinguishing pattern from process (or traditional or phylogenetic)\ncladism as the rejection of \u201ca priori evolutionary\nbackground assumptions from the inference of patterns of relationships\namong taxa.\u201d As such, pattern cladists have strongly objected to\nlikelihood and other model-based phylogenetic methods, as those\nexplicitly incorporate evolutionary models (\u00a71.2.3 and\n\u00a72.4). This has typically gone hand-in-hand with a rejection of\nstatistical approaches more generally, and a commitment to parsimony,\ne.g., \u201cthe statistical approach to phylogenetic inference was\nwrong from the start, for it rests on the idea that to study phylogeny\nat all, one must first know in great detail how evolution has\nproceeded. That cannot very well be the way in which scientific\nknowledge is obtained\u201d (Farris 1983: 17).\n\nIn response, statistical phylogeneticists have argued that parsimony\nmethods implicitly include evolutionary models, which model-based\nmethods simply make explicit and, thus, subject to interrogation (de\nQueiroz & Poe 2001, 2003; Swofford & Sullivan 2009). This\nfault line is further reflected in the way pattern cladists view other\nproponents of parsimony as allies in this debate, as Brower (2019:\n717), approvingly citing Kluge & Farris (1999), makes clear:\n\u201cdespite this difference of opinion regarding critical\nbackground knowledge, there is no practical distinction between\npattern and process cladists\u2019 evidence, analyses or results.\nFrom a methodological perspective, all cladists group by synapomorphy\nalone.\u201d That is, it is in the interpretation of methodology and\ninferential justification that distinctions are drawn between pattern\nand process cladists; in the larger debate with statistical\nphylogeneticists they are allied. Note, however, that ever finer\ndistinctions of the term \u2018cladist\u2019 are being introduced\n(let alone \u2018statistical phylogeneticists\u2019, who typically\nassociate with model-based approaches). This reflects the way this\nterm has grown contested and associated with various competing sets of\ncommitments. It is worth taking a brief detour in section 2.3.1 to\nsort through this a bit.\n2.3.1 Who Owns the Term \u201cCladist\u201d?\n\nIn\n section 1.2.1,\n we used the term \u201ccladistics\u201d to refer to a school of\ntaxonomy which held that higher taxa must be monophyletic, and stood\nin contrast to the competing schools of phenetics/numerical taxonomy\nand evolutionary taxonomy. In this historical context,\n\u201ccladistics\u201d was sometimes used interchangeably with\n\u201cphylogenetics\u201d. We caution against that practice,\nespecially when discussing more contemporary practices. Though it is\nhard to pin down a precise date when these terms began to carry\ndifferent connotations, Felsenstein (1978) and Beatty (1982) are as\ngood a marker as any for when these terms began to diverge and take on\nmore nuanced senses. This is particularly true of the term\n\u201ccladist\u201d, which has become a highly disputed term, and\none that has been claimed by sub-groups within the larger field of\nphylogenetics.\n\nAn apt example of this is the journal Cladistics, whose\neditors published a controversial editorial in 2016 stating that\nsubmitted manuscripts should reflect the philosophical commitments of\nthe journal and its sponsoring professional society (The Willi\nHennig Society) (Editors 2016). They write,\n\n\nThe epistemological paradigm of this journal is parsimony. There are\nstrong philosophical arguments in support of parsimony versus other\nmethods of phylogenetic inference (e.g., Farris 1983).\n\n\nThe editorial continues, stipulating that \u201cPhylogenetic data\nsets submitted to this journal should be analysed using\nparsimony\u201d. If trees generated by alternative methods show\ndifferent results, these may be included if authors prefer those\ntopologies, but only if authors are \u201cprepared to defend it on\nphilosophical grounds\u201d (all quotes from Editors 2016: 1). The\neditors, here, are using the imprimatur of the journal\nCladistics to stake out a specific sense of how\n\u201ccladistics\u201d ought to be understood, and what calling\noneself a \u201cCladist\u201d signals about the underlying\ntheoretical and philosophical commitments held about phylogenetic\ninference, i.e., an exclusive commitment to parsimony\nmethods\u2014going so far as to reject model-based statistical\napproaches entirely.\n\nAleta Quinn (2017) argues that the term \u201ccladist\u201d remains\none claimed by multiple overlapping (yet importantly distinct) camps.\nShe tackles the ambiguity head on, providing a useful \u201cforeign\nlanguage dictionary\u201d of ways that \u201ccladist\u201d gets\nused in systematics. Quinn argues that the term is in need of\ndisambiguation, drawing seven different senses from the literature.\nThis includes systematists that advocate adherence to particular\nphylogenetic methods (e.g., parsimony, as in the case of the\nCladistics editorial) or philosophical justifications\n(especially to a version of Popperian falsificationism), though the\nvarious distinctions of competing senses of \u201ccladist\u201d go\nwell beyond this. In response to Quinn, Williams and Ebach (2018)\npropose an eighth (and their preferred) sense of cladist, and Brower\n(2018a) offers a focused commentary on Quinn\u2019s article, as well\nas other attempts to clarify the philosophical foundations and\ncommitments of pattern cladism. For example, a distinguishing feature\nof pattern cladism is the rejection of a priori assumptions\nabout evolutionary theory in phylogenetic methods. This has been\ninterpreted as a claim of theory-neutrality or minimality by some\nphilosophers and biologists (e.g., Pearson 2010). Brower (2019)\ncontests this interpretation, arguing that the claim of theory\nneutrality is specific to evolutionary assumptions, as opposed to a\nmore general claim.\n\nThe primary take away is that care should be taken when philosophers\nuse the term \u201ccladist\u201d. Though there are a lot of\ninteresting philosophical topics to unpack around this term, it must\nbe acknowledged that it has become ambiguous. There are simply too\nmany senses of this term for it to be used without clearly specifying\nprecisely what sense is being invoked. We encourage philosophers\nwriting about phylogenetics to follow the lead of systematists, and\navoid using the terms \u201ccladist\u201d, \u201ccladistics\u201d,\nand other cognates as synonymous with \u201cphylogenetics\u201d.\nInstead, philosophers should reserve usage of those terms and\ncarefully specify which sub-set of phylogeneticists (or their work)\nthose terms are referring to.\n2.4 Long-Branch Attraction and model based methods\n\nIn\n section 2.3\n we mentioned that the falsificationist justification of parsimony was\nmet with a serious challenge by the discovery that it was subject to\nmaking systematic errors under certain conditions. Joseph\nFelsenstein\u2019s (1978) paper, \u201cCases in which Parsimony or\nCompatibility Methods Will be Positively Misleading\u201d first\ndescribes what came to be known as the phenomenon of\n\u201clong-branch attraction\u201d. Though hardly the beginning of\ndebates between parsimony and model-based phylogenetic methods, it\nrepresents an important inflection point in discussions about\nphylogenetic inference.\n\nLong-branch attraction refers to the tendency of some methods to\npreferentially group together long branches (those with more\nevolutionary changes) regardless of their actual history. Methods\ndesigned to identify trees requiring the fewest number of evolutionary\nchanges to explain the data will prefer explanations of shared\nancestry over convergent evolution\u2014even in cases where\nconvergent evolution occurred. For example, imagine two branches with\nrapidly evolving DNA sequences. By chance alone, the two branches\nmight have the same mutation at the same site which parsimony treats\nas evidence that these branches share a recent history. In a range of\ncases, the chances of these similar mutations occurring is so high\nthat we expect the number of these convergent cases to overwhelm the\nsignal from the true homologies. In these cases, the parsimony method\nis statistically inconsistent. A method is statistically consistent\nwhen it is guaranteed, as more data are added, to identify the correct\nsolution. Methods that fail to do this are statistically inconsistent.\nIn this case, not only does parsimony fail to be consistent, but the\nmethod reliably returns increased support for a specific, incorrect\noutcome as more data are added and hence is \u201cpositively\nmisleading\u201d.\n\nLong-branch attraction is more than just an operational problem, it\nalso challenges the falsificationist underpinnings of parsimony (Haber\n2009). Recall that on Wiley\u2019s (1975) influential account,\nphylogenetic trees are subject to being falsified as more data\n(characters) are discovered or added\n (\u00a72.3).\n If a more parsimonious tree is available to explain those data, the\npreviously most parsimonious tree is treated as falsified (or as\ncontaining more ad hoc hypotheses of homoplasy). Felsenstein\u2019s\ndiscovery was that in some circumstances, as more characters are\nincluded in a parsimony analysis, parsimony will be prone to rejecting\nhypotheses that report the actual phylogenetic relations, while\ncorroborating more parsimonious\u2014but incorrect\u2014phylogenetic\nhypotheses. This undermines the logical justification of parsimony\nanalysis.\n\nFelsenstein (1978) was (and remains) an immensely impactful paper,\ngenerating numerous research programs. It is a largely theoretical and\nabstract paper that considers how different methods perform under\ndifferent biological conditions. One natural question that might be\nposed concerns how prevalent these conditions are in the actual\nsystems being studied. This is an empirical question, of course, and\ncan be studied as such, though disputes over how to interpret\nempirical cases have proven controversial (Huelsenbeck 1997; Whiting\n1998; Siddall & Whiting 1999; Yang & Rannala 2012).\n\nIn the 1990s experimental phylogeneticists used empirical and\nsimulation studies to more rigorously empirically test claims of\nperformance of competing phylogenetic methods. This included testing\ncompeting methods to reconstruct known in-vivo phylogenies (of\nbacteriophage) that were carefully constructed, tracked, and archived\nover many generations and more complex simulated phylogenies (taking\nadvantage of the ever-growing processing power available on the lab\nbench) (Hillis, Bull, White, Badgett, & Molineux 1992; Hillis\n& Bull 1993; Hillis, Huelsenbeck, & Cunningham 1994). These\nlargely confirmed that distance and parsimony methods were subject to\nlong-branch attraction, where model-based statistical methods such as\nlikelihood avoided these epistemic traps.\n2.5 Phylogenetics & Philosophy of Statistics\n\nFelsenstein\u2019s (1978) paper is also impactful because of his\ncommitment to statistical consistency as the standard bearer\nfor evaluating competing statistical approaches. For Felsenstein and\nmany other phylogeneticists, showing that parsimony is statistically\ninconsistent is a fatal blow. But not everyone agrees. In fact, some\nauthors argue that it is close to an irrelevant consideration. We now\nturn to this debate about the importance of consistency as an example\nof how philosophy plays a central role in phylogenetic theory.\n\nLike Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza before him, Felsenstein (1978) treats\nphylogenetic inference as a problem for statistics. Jerzy Neyman\n(1971) pointed to the emerging field of molecular phylogenetics as a\nsource of novel and interesting statistical problems. In the\nintervening fifty years the field has only expanded in importance to\nthe point where phylogenetic inference is now one of the central\nproblems in statistics. Similarly, research on algorithms for\ninferring phylogenies has been important in computer science for\ndecades.\n\nIf phylogenetic inference is seen as a problem in statistical\ninference, it might be thought that general arguments for ideal\nstatistical methods will just apply in this case. Maximum likelihood\nor Bayesian methods could be defended on these grounds for example. In\nthis light, parsimony is a statistical method and as such, we can\nstudy its statistical properties (Felsenstein 1983, 2004). Anthony\nEdwards (1996) claims that his initial usage of the \u201cminimum\nevolution\u201d principle was as an approximation to the maximum\nlikelihood solution which he believed to be justified on general,\nstatistical grounds, i.e., parsimony methods could be assessed as a\nstatistical approach. Since that time, a number of authors have shown\nexact connections (ordinally equivalent rankings) between parsimony\nand likelihood in a range of cases (Felsenstein 1973; Sober 1985;\nTuffley & Steel 1997; Steel & Penny 2000).\n\nIn an exchange on parsimony and likelihood between Felsenstein and\nElliott Sober, Felsenstein defends the idea that consistency \u201cis\na fundamental property\u201d and in particular, that it is more\nfundamental than likelihood (Felsenstein & Sober 1986). He\nreiterates his earlier claim that\n\n\nmaximum likelihood methods are not desirable in themselves, but\nbecause they have desirable statistical properties such as consistency\nand asymptotic efficiency. (Felsenstein 1978: 408)\n\n\nWith this attitude, Felsenstein is merely following an old and\nvenerable position in statistics. For example, Fisher (1956: 141)\ncalled consistency \u201cthe fundamental criterion of\nestimation\u201d and said that inconsistent estimators are\n\u201coutside the pale of decent usage\u201d (Fisher 1935 [1950:\n11]). Neyman (1952: 188) agrees.\n\nContrary to Felsenstein\u2019s position, Sober claims that\n\n\nOne does not \u201cjustify\u201d a method by showing that there is\nan extremely special case in which it does its work well; nor does one\n\u201crefute\u201d a method by showing that there is another special\ncase in which it makes a hash of things. (Sober 1988b: 76)\n\n\nOne particular argument that he gives against consistency is that it\ncan conflict with likelihood. Sober (1988a) presents an example in\nwhich likelihood inference can fail to be consistent. But Sober\nfollows Anthony Edwards (1972) in positing that likelihood is a\n\u201cprimitive postulate\u201d which does not need justification\nbased on repeated sampling. If a likelihood inference can fail to be\nstatistically consistent but is still justified, then clearly\nconsistency cannot be a necessary criterion of justified\ninference.\n\nA different kind of worry about consistency is expressed by authors\nwho point out that it is not clear what consistent method we could\nuse. As the editors of Cladistics put it in their editorial\ndefending the use of parsimony,\n\n\nwe do not consider the hypothetical problem of statistical\ninconsistency to constitute a philosophical argument for the rejection\nof parsimony. All phylogenetic methods, including parsimony, may\nproduce inconsistent or otherwise inaccurate results for a given data\nset. (Editors 2016)\n\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation is known to be provably consistent under\na wide variety of conditions (Wald 1949), but several authors have\nargued that these conditions do not apply to estimating the tree\ntopology since tree topologies are discrete, not continuous,\nparameters (Yang 1996; Siddall 1998; Farris 1999). However, Swofford\net al. (2001) argue that Wald\u2019s conditions do apply and Yang\n(1994), Chang (1996), and Rogers (2001) prove that maximum likelihood\nis consistent under different assumptions about character evolution.\nBut regardless of which assumptions suffice for likelihood to be\nconsistent, some assumptions about the evolutionary process are\ndefinitely required. But what happens when the model we use is not the\ncorrect model? This is especially problematic when combined with the\nview that to be a correct model it should be true, and that we could\nnever know that our model was true or perhaps even that there is no\nsuch thing as a true model, as some pattern cladists have claimed\n(e.g., Brower 2016, 2018b). As Felsenstein (2004: 272) puts it,\n\n\nlikelihood is usually consistent if we use the correct model in our\nanalysis. When we use the wrong model, there are few guarantees.\n\n2.6 Phylogenetics and Philosophy\n\nThe philosophy of statistics is but one area among many where\nphilosophical arguments contribute to work in phylogenetics. Though\nphylogenetics is a subfield of biology (and, arguably, of statistics\nand computer science), phylogenetic inference is a topic on which both\nphilosophers and biologists work, often in overlapping ways. Indeed,\nthe boundary between science and philosophy here is blurry in a way\nreminiscent of some of the natural philosophy of the seventeenth and\neighteenth centuries. An upshot of this is that phylogenetic inference\nis an enormously rich area for philosophers to explore. Biologists are\nactively debating the conceptual foundations of phylogenetic\nmethodology, justification, goals, explanatory models, etc. It is not\nuncommon to see philosophers playing a central role in these debates\n(e.g., Hull 1988; Sober 1988b). It also means that many biologists are\neager to engage with philosophers in meaningful and deeply informed\nways (e.g., Sterner & Lidgard 2018; Havstad & Smith 2019).\n\nPhylogenetic inference is, generally, best categorized as a problem of\nepistemology. It is, after all, a problem of inference, albeit\nspecialized to how we justify or ground our beliefs about phylogeny.\nAn epistemologist who wonders how we can have knowledge of the past\ncan hardly do better than to look to phylogenetics (Sober 1988b). And\nas we have seen, philosophy of statistics and of inductive inference\nmore generally looms large. But moving beyond epistemology, any\nphilosopher interested in how science works can learn from\nphylogenetics. Here we will look at the cases of metaphysics and the\ngeneral philosophy of science.\n2.6.1 Phylogenetic inference as general philosophy of science\n\nUnderstanding details of the evolutionary history of life is not\nsimply a stand-alone problem (as interesting as that problem would\nbe). The history of life and the history of the planet are tied\ntogether such that knowledge in one domain aids our inferences in the\nother. Knowing what types of fossils are embedded in rocks together\nwith a phylogeny can help scientists date the rocks just as dating the\nrocks through independent means aids in dating the fossils and thus in\nestimating aspects of the phylogeny (Grantham 2004). And just as the\nphysics and chemistry of the planet have shaped living things, life\nhas shaped the planet as well. Photosynthetic cyanobacteria were\npartially responsible for the great oxygenation event roughly 2.4\nbillion years ago, where oxygen build up in the Earth\u2019s\natmosphere fundamentally altered the chemistry and physics of the\nearth.\n\nThis entanglement with other sciences makes phylogenetics a rich\nsource for philosophers of science. It provides a model to better\nunderstand how science works when specialized fields inform and rely\non each other. Philosophers might draw on phylogenetics to better\nunderstand the social structure of complexes of sciences (Longino\n1990, 2019) (and complex sciences that draw on other fields), or to\ncharacterize what constitutes good scientific activity for what might\nbe called \u201cservice sciences\u201d, i.e., sciences whose\nproducts are largely used by other scientists as end-users.\n\nOne way to frame debates in the Systematics Wars is as scientists\nwrestling over the question of what constitutes good science. Here we\ntake the opportunity to highlight what may be an under-appreciated\naspect of this debate. Namely, does good science require theory?\nThough many of the traditional sciences studied by philosophers of\nscience are clearly driven by (or, at least, tightly linked to)\ntheory, this does not always appear to be the case for other sciences.\nContrast Newtonian mechanics or population genetics with, say, the\nstudy of stem cells (Fagan 2013) or developmental biology (Love 2014),\nwhere it is unclear whether there are any underlying\ntheoretical structures.\n\nIn the case of systematics, it is unclear how to articulate a\nprecise theory for any of these competing views. It is\nprobably more accurately portrayed as competing sets of commitments,\nsome of which may resemble (or be) scientific theories (depending on\nthe characterizations of \u201cscientific theory\u201d), where other\ncommitments might be better described in terms of scientific practice\nor mode of reasoning (Giere 1979 [1997]; Griesemer 2000).\n\nWhether and what the theoretical structure of phylogenetics is remains\nan open debate. Yet, though scientists that research, study, and\ndevelop phylogenetic methods have a lot at stake in these debates,\nmost of the end users of these methods are rather agnostic\nabout those competing methods (and, in many cases, the underlying\ntheories supporting those methods). In practice, most biologists that\nuse phylogenetic methods typically use lots of them.\nPhilosophers of science might consider whether this amounts to an\nadoption of methodological pluralism or theory agnosticism, and\nwhether trees produced under competing methodologies constitute robust\nresults (e.g., when identifying the same monophyletic groups or\nhomologies).\n\nPhylogenetic inference should also be of interest to a wider range of\nphilosophers for the way it can function as a case study for other\nphilosophical issues. The recent history of phylogenetics has provided\nphilosophers with test cases for how scientists shift from one set of\ncommitments to another (Hull 1988), for the role of inductive logic\nand probability in both explanation and model construction (Sober\n1988a,b; Haber 2005), and for what constitutes a good scientific\nexplanation (Felsenstein & Sober 1986; Sober 2004; Haber 2009).\nO\u2019Hara (1988) and Ereshefsky (2012) look to phylogenetics to see\nhow narrative or historical explanations function in the sciences.\nOther examples of philosophers using phylogenetics to assess\nphilosophical theses include Velasco (2012) and Vassend (2020) using\nphylogenetics to examine practices of modeling and idealization, and\nHaber (2005) looking at what phylogenetic inference tells us of how\nprobabilistic reasoning may be used to assess singular historical\nevents. Aleta Quinn proposes a taxonomy of disputes in contemporary\nsystematics that she argues stems from disputes over application of\nthe principle of total evidence (2019), and uses the case of\nphylogenetics to examine a well known objection leveled against\nproponents of inference to the best explanation in the sciences\n(2016), the \u201cbest of the bad lot argument\u201d (van Fraassen\n1989), or the \u201cunderconsideration objection\u201d (Lipton\n2004). And finally, Andreasen (1998, 2000) looks to phylogenetics to\nanswer the question of whether biological races are real.\n2.6.2 Phylogenetic inference as a problem of metaphysics\n\nThough phylogenetics as we described it is largely an epistemological\nenterprise, biological systematics as a whole is filled with important\nand controversial metaphysical issues which might seem to be largely\nindependent of problems of inference. Whether you treat taxa as\ntraditional natural kinds (Devitt 2008), homeostatic property clusters\n(Boyd 1999; Wilson, Barker, & Brigandt 2007), individuals\n(Ghiselin 1966, 1974; Hull 1976, 1978; Sober 1980; Ereshefsky 1991;\nHaber 2016a) or something else (Slater 2013, 2014) will typically\ncarry little to no impact on debates about phylogenetic\ninference\u2014especially as those played out in the philosophical\nliterature.\n\nYet, early phylogeneticists certainly saw metaphysical implications of\ntheir views, and this impacted how they approach the problem of\nreconstructing phylogeny. Simply put, if you think that taxa are\nhistorical entities, and that the aim of phylogeny is the\nreconstruction of their histories, the task is very different than if\nyou take the aim to be to find ahistorical similarities or shared\nessential characters (Hull 1970; Griffiths 1974). Though given the\nubiquitous adoption of the phylogenetic project (in a broad sense),\ndebates over how metaphysics ought to impact inferential methods\ncontinues in some areas of phylogenetics.\n\nDo competing metaphysical views in systematics impact phylogenetic\ninference? Yes, though only obliquely and indirectly, and it\u2019s\nvery important to take care not to conflate issues of classification\nwith the problem of reconstructing phylogenies\u2014even when they\noverlap. Let\u2019s take a very brief look at the former, followed by\nsome commentary on the oblique and indirect way it may overlap with\nphylogenetic inference.\n\nEreshefsky (2001) argues that a commitment to phylogenetic principles\nentails a reformation of the practice and norms around biological\nclassification. Specifically, he recommends leaving behind the\ntraditional Linnaean classification naming practices in favor of a\nphylogenetically informed practice. This follows a tradition stemming\nback to the very earliest phylogenetic literature that sought to\nreform biological classification around the principle of monophyly\n(e.g., Hennig 1966; Griffiths 1976; Wiley 1981). For many\nphylogeneticists this goal continues to this day\u2014most recently\naround the development of the PhyloCode (see\n Other Internet Resources;\n de Queiroz & Gauthier 1990, 1992, 1994; Cantino & de Queiroz\n2020). Though structural reforms to wholly replace Linnaean taxonomy\nhave struggled to gain wide-scale traction and adoption, taxonomists\nhave largely adopted monophyly as a guiding principle in\nclassification and systematics\u2014even in the context of so-called\ntraditional taxonomy (though microbial systematics has proven more\nresistant; see\n \u00a73.1).\n\nOf course, how biologists reconstruct a phylogeny and\nidentify monophyletic groups is a matter of taxonomic freedom on the\nPhyloCode and other phylogenetic classifications. That\u2019s just to\nsay that phylogenetic inference will operate largely independently of\nthese metaphysical and classificatory issues\u2014except insofar as\nthese classifications inform biologists about what it is that\nthey are aiming to reconstruct a history of in the first place. Haber\n(2019) provides a framing for this challenge, arguing that the units\nof phylogeny are the units of divergence and diversification. Where\nEreshefsky (2001) and other advocates of phylogenetic classification\nprovide a specific way of cashing out those units, Haber describes\nthis as a rich, general research project, similar to other\n\u201cunit\u201d problems in philosophy of biology. In much the same\nway that how we cash out, say, the units of selection may impact how\nwe study or draw inferences about evolutionary processes, how we\nidentify the units of divergence and diversification will impact how\nwe draw inferences in phylogenetics. (See de Queiroz 2007 for related\nfoundational issues.)\n\nPadian & Horner (2002) offer a coarse-grained example of how a\nmetaphysical commitment overlaps with issues of phylogenetic inference\nin their defense of treating Aves as the sole living branch of\ndinosaurs. In this case, they identify \u201ctransformationist\u201d\nthinking against typological thinking. In the former, the identity of\ntaxa is associated with historical continuity, and untethered from the\nexpression of any intrinsic characters. Thus, the transformation of\nancient theropod dinosaurs into the the living clade of birds means\nthat birds are dinosaurs, and that this ought to be reflected\nin our phylogenetic reconstructions. In contrast, they argue, a\ntypological account will treat birds as distinct from dinosaurs, and\nrisks a phylogenetic reconstruction that misrepresents the historical\nrelationship of these taxa. Moreover, they argue that\ntransformationist and typological approaches will differentially\ncategorize features of avian and ancient theropods as evidence and\ndata; what even counts as inferentially relevant is itself at stake.\nPadian and Horner, here, are identifying metaphysical commitments from\nphylogenetics to argue how paleontologists ought to reconstruct\nevolutionary history, what counts as evidence, and what kinds of\nevidence are important for drawing those inferences, i.e., how\ncharacters are coded is treated as a methodological dispute entailed\nby theoretical commitments. (See Haber 2016b in\n Other Internet Resources\n for further discussion.)\n3. Looking Ahead: New Challenges and Opportunities\n\nWe began by noting that a phylogeny reconstructs evolutionary history\nand that different types of entities have an evolutionary\nhistory\u2014for example, genes, organisms, populations, and species\nall have genealogical histories. Assume that we are trying to\nreconstruct the history of species or higher taxa (indeed,\n\u201cphylogeny\u201d itself is sometimes defined this way, e.g.,\nWiley 1981; S. Edwards 2009). Standard methods such as parsimony,\nlikelihood, and bayesian methods all directly infer the history of\ncharacters. So what is the connection between the history of these\ncharacters and the phylogeny of the species? The unstated assumption\nis that the histories of these characters are the same and line up\nwith the species history. We conclude this entry by acknowledging that\nthis unstated assumption is often violated and we consider what effect\nthis has on the theory and practice of phylogenetic inference. As we\nwill see, examining this unstated assumption forces us to directly\nface the question of what a phylogeny actually represents and thus\nwhat \u201cphylogenetic inference\u201d even means.\n\nIn order to facilitate an entry point into this topic we treated\nphylogenetic trees and the histories they represent as simple\nbifurcating entities, i.e., as straight-forward branch-and-node\nstructures. Yet, this is an idealization, and actual phylogenetic\nhistories are typically more complex than this. Branches can fuse\ntogether, and branching events turn out to be more complex than the\nunidimensional instantaneous point a node might suggest.\n\nAs philosophers of science are well aware, idealization in science is\nboth common and serves important purposes (e.g., Cartwright 1983;\nMcMullin 1985; Wimsatt 2007; Weisberg 2007). Yet, it can be fruitful\nto pause and consider if some of these idealizations and simplifying\nassumptions need to be re-examined, are hindering studies, or\ngenerating other road blocks. Indeed, that\u2019s precisely what has\nhappened recently in phylogenetics. Re-examining the utility of\nsimplifying assumptions in phylogenetics has come both from outside\nthe field (particularly from microbiology) and internally (as\nphylogeneticists began to appreciate what might be gained from\nincorporating more complexity). This is (or, at least, can be) a good\nand healthy thing for a science. It puts pressure on scientists and\nphilosophers to further articulate the central commitments of a\nscience, and to consider how to account for new challenges. Challenges\ncan also push a science to adapt and revise those central commitments\nas new evidence, theories, and tools are discovered or developed, or\nto revisit the utility of underlying simplifying assumptions and\nidealizations. This, in turn, helps philosophers of science understand\nhow science can advance. (Haber 2019 describes this in the context of\nphylogenetics as productive disruptions.)\n\nRevisiting the utility of idealizing away the complexity of\nphylogenetic histories has generated both hard challenges and new\nopportunities for phylogeneticists moving forward (Haber 2012, 2019;\nVelasco 2012). Here we provide a brief overview of what relaxing these\nassumptions amounts to, and what kinds of complexity we are\nacknowledging when these assumptions no longer hold. Following this,\nwe briefly describe how this impacts the central commitments and\nproject of phylogenetics.\n3.1 Reticulation & Discordance\n\nIn the previous sections we treated phylogenetic trees as\nstraight-forwardly bifurcating models, regularly referring back to\n Figure 1.\n Branches represent ancestral lineages, and nodes represent lineage\nsplits. Yet, this view of phylogenetics is also highly idealized,\nreflecting at least three simplifying assumptions: (1) that lineages\nsplit but do not fuse; (2) that changes on one lineage do not affect\nother lineages, and (3) that splits are singular, simple events. Each\nof these assumptions turn out to be false.\n\nIn order to think about how lineages split or fuse, we have to first\nanswer the question of what a lineage represents. In the case of a\nphylogeny where the tips are species, the natural answer is that the\nlineages are tracking species through time and the nodes represent\nspeciation events. But consider the assumption that lineages split but\ndo not fuse. For many readers, hybridization may be the most obvious\ncounter-example. After all, hybridization is relatively familiar,\nespecially for cases involving sexually reproducing charismatic\nmega-fauna and, even more frequently, plants.\n\nIn the case of speciation by hybridization, it is clear that entire\nlineages can fuse. Exactly how often this occurs is disputed and of\ncourse will depend on how you define species in the first place. But\nit is a widespread occurrence in plants and is known to happen in\nanimals as well (Mallet 2007; Schumer, Rosenthal, & Andolfatto\n2014).\n\nWhile most occurrences of hybridization do not lead to new species,\nmany often lead to introgression\u2013that is, the introduction of\ngenetic information from one lineage to another. If we model this as\none lineage connecting to another, we violate the assumption that a\nphylogeny is a strictly branching tree diagram. But if we instead do\nnot depict these lineages as directly connected, then we violate\nanother background assumption in phylogenetics, namely, that changes\nalong one branch do not affect any other branches. In either case, we\nnow have a situation where the branching history of some characters is\nnot the same as the history of others or of the history of the species\nas a whole. In the case of genetic history, this is known as\ngenealogical discordance.\n\nWhile hybridization among sexually reproducing species already\nprovides good counter-examples to our assumptions about the\nindependence of lineages, the bigger challenges have come from\n microbiology\n. More\nspecifically, what we find in microbial genomics are high levels of\nhorizontal (or lateral) gene transfer (HGT or LGT). For readers\nunfamiliar with microbial genomics, this can be thought of as the\nmicrobial analogue to hybridization, though there are important\nqualitative and quantitative differences.\n\nQualitatively, HGT is not a mode of reproduction, though it does\ninvolve the transfer of genomic parts between microbes. Unlike in\nreproduction, the genomic transfer is not (typically) between parent\nand offspring microbes, but adjacent ones. Roughly, when microbes make\ncontact, they can exchange parts of their genome, which means that the\nhistory of these genomic parts may be distinct from the history of the\nmicrobial organisms in which we find those genetic units. HGT can be\nhighly advantageous for microbes, and genomic parts can quickly spread\nthrough microbial populations, especially if they carry beneficial\ncharacteristics. Quantitatively, the rate of HGT in microbes is\nenormously high and commonplace, especially relative to hybridization\nin, say, mammalian species.\n\nThe upshot of widespread HGT is that microbial genes will frequently\nhave different histories, and genetic parts will sometimes flow from\none lineage to very distantly related lineages. Microbialists and\nphilosophers of biology have taken up the question of whether\nreticulation in microbial histories is enough to entirely undercut the\nutility of phylogenetics in microbial genomics, and how this has\nimpacted the utility of the tree of life metaphor more\ngenerally (e.g., Martin 1999; Doolittle 1999; Velasco 2013 see too the\nspecial issue of Biology & Philosophy [O\u2019Malley,\nMartin, & Dupr\u00e9 2010]).\n\nThe final simplifying assumption treats lineage splits as singular\nevents that wholly separate a lineage into two distinct new branches\nthat we can cleanly track. When we think about the process of\nspeciation, it is clear that speciation and lineage separation more\ngenerally is often not instantaneous (de Queiroz 1998; Harrison 1998).\nWhat is less clear is how this matters to phylogenetics. Thinking\ncarefully about lineage splits and the internal structure of lineages\nforces us to examine the nature and relationships of the multilevel\norganization of the lineages we track (Haber 2012, 2019). More\ninclusive lineages contain less-inclusive lineages as parts,\nreflecting the hierarchical organization found in biology\u2013a\nfeature of lineages well appreciated by early phylogeneticists, e.g.,\nHennig 1966; Griffiths 1974). Species trees, for example, contain gene\ntrees within their branches (Maddison 1997).\n\nWhen individual gene histories are incongruent with each other or with\ntheir containing species trees we have genealogical discordance. We\nhave already seen how hybridization and horizontal gene transfer can\ncause discordance, but as systematics has become increasingly\nconnected with population genetics, another source of discordance has\nloomed large\u2014incomplete lineage sorting. Any two copies of a\ngene in a population will share a common ancestor in the past called\ntheir point of coalescence. If two gene lineages in the same species\nlineage fail to coalesce within that species branch (that is, their\npoint of coalescence is earlier than than the most recent speciation\nor lineage branching) we have what is called incomplete lineage\nsorting (ILS). In a case of incomplete lineage sorting it is\npossible that one of the gene lineages first coalesces with a gene\nlineage from another species and thus is a case of genealogical\ndiscordance. This generates what Avise and Robinson (2008) have termed\nhemiplasies, i.e., homologous characters whose phylogenetic\nhistories are topologically discordant with higher level phylogenies\ndue to ILS. Maddison (1997) provides a very readable introduction to\nthe relationship between gene trees and species trees and the problems\nof genealogical discordance while Degnan and Rosenberg (2009) is a\nslightly more advanced introduction to the biology of incomplete\nlineage sorting and its affects on phylogenetic inference.\n\nTo summarize, we first discussed phylogenetic inference as it was\ntypically done prior to around the 1990s. First, infer the history of\na number of characters (for example, genes). Each of these histories\nis a particular, branching tree. Now assume that these histories are\nthe same as the species history. It is this assumption that allows\nmethods such as parsimony or likelihood to evaluate competing\nhypotheses. The species history is then also a branching tree even\nthough we know that in general, this is a kind of idealization\nassuming that (1) that lineages split but do not fuse, (2) that\ninformation is not transferred between lineages , and (3) that splits\nare singular, simple events. Each of these assumptions turn out to be\nfalse.\n3.2 Impacts on Phylogenetic Inference\n\nThe reticulation and genealogical discordance generated by\nhybridization, HGT, ILS, and other complexities stemming from the\nstructure and processes involving biological lineages have,\nhistorically, been obscured by idealizing assumptions in\nphylogenetics. In many cases treating phylogenetic trees as idealized\nmodels of genealogical history is useful and appropriate for the\nresearch question at hand.\n Figure 1\n offers a good example of this. This reflects how the level of\nresolution relative to our research questions can drive the way we use\nphylogenetic tools (O\u2019Hara 1993).\n\nBut what happens when these idealizing assumptions are critically\ninterrogated? First, the fact that different entities have different,\noften incompatible, genealogical histories brings into question the\nvery nature of phylogeny. One line of thought is that a phylogeny\nshould directly track genetic history rather than the history of\nspeciation. As Maddison (1995: 285) puts it,\n\n\none possible interpretation of a species phylogeny is that it depicts\nthe lines by which genetic information was passed on and nothing\nmore.\n\n\nBaum and Shaw (1995), Baum (2007), and Velasco (2010, 2019) represent\na series of papers devoted to developing this \u201cconcordance\ntree\u201d idea. Baum (2009) incorporates this line of thought about\nphylogenetic history into the debate over the nature of species and\nother taxa.\n\nPhilosophers have paid particular attention to reticulation in the\ncontext of microbial genomics, and for good reason (O\u2019Malley et\nal. 2010 is a notable special edition dedicated to this topic and is a\nuseful resource). These are often framed as challenges to the\nphylogenetic approach itself, or, in other cases, how and whether the\ntools of phylogenetics apply to microbial genomics (Martin 1999;\nDoolittle 1999). The breadth of HGT in microbial systems has also led\nto challenges to the more conceptual and metaphysical commitments\nabout species and other phylogenetic units (Franklin 2007).\n\nHowever, the majority of work in phylogenetics today continues with\nthe same goals as before, but with biologists using better and more\npowerful tools for incorporating these complexities into their\nphylogenetic models. Haber (2019) offers a philosophical treatment of\nhow reticulation and genealogical discordance introduces both\nchallenges and opportunities in the context of phylogenetic inference,\nasking whether the branches of phylogenetic trees are \u201ctoo\nthin\u201d and obscure relevant details found in the internal\nstructure of those lineages. There are a lot of good reasons\nphylogeneticists might aim to include reticulate structure in their\nphylogenetic reconstructions. Among other things, it means treating\ngenealogical discordance as data that can be mined, as opposed to\nnoise that needs to be filtered out (Haber 2012, 2019). Philosophers\nhave begun paying more attention to ways that reticulation and\ndiscordance have impacted phylogenetic inference beyond microbial\ngenomics. Rather than coming as challenges from cognate fields, these\ninclude ways that practicing phylogeneticists have sought to account\nfor and accommodate what we have come to understand about reticulation\nand discordance (see Haber & Molter 2019 for a special issue\ndedicated to this topic).\n\nPopulation biologists were among the first to operationalize methods\nfor extracting information about the history of lineages from the\ninternal structure of those lineages, i.e., by examining the structure\nof individuals in a populations, population biologists developed\nmethods for inferring historical coalescent points of those\nindividuals (Hudson 1983; Kingman 1982, 2000; Tajima 1983). These\nmethods exploit the fact that after a lineage splits it takes time for\nthat split to be wholly reflected in the kinship relations of the\nparts of those lineages. Or, to put it in more familiar terms, it\ntakes time for the parts of a lineage to all be more closely related\nto each other than any are to parts in other lineages These approaches\ncan be viewed as the continued development of methods in the larger\ncontext of the close ties between the application of statistical tools\nand molecular biology\n (\u00a71.2.3).\n\nMaddison (1997) represents a more recent launching point for a new\nappreciation of the role that the internal structure of lineages can\nplay in phylogenetic inference. Briefly, the continued advancement of\nmolecular and computational techniques provided the opportunity to\nproduce ever-finely resolved phylogenies of the systems of interest.\nWhat quickly became apparent was a confirmation of what is only\nimplicit in Hennig (1966): that the hierarchical structure of taxa may\nresult in discordant phylogenies at different levels (or even within\nlevels) of the biological hierarchy. As an example, Maddison describes\nhow the phylogenies of individual genes or nucleotides may display\ndifferent phylogenetic topographies from the organisms or populations\nin which we sampled those genes. This is not a result of error or\nhomoplasy, but of genuine phylogenetic discordance between gene level\nlineages and the higher-level lineages in which they reside.\n\nMaddison (1997) is also directly about how we ought to incorporate\nwhat we learn about the internal structure of lineages into our models\nof phylogenetic inference, and how we might build on the earlier work\non coalescent models. Maddison is among the first to deeply appreciate\nhow impactful the then-new work on genomics might be for\nphylogenetics, both in the ways that discordance will present serious\nchallenges and opportunities for phylogenetic inference. This has\nhelped spur new developments in this field of phylogenetics, (e.g.,\nMaddison & Knowles 2006; Degnan & Rosenberg 2006, 2009; Baum\n2007; Nakhleh 2013; Hahn & Nakhleh 2016; Mallet, Besansky, &\nHahn 2016).\n\nHaber (2019) offers two reasons why these new developments in\nphylogenetic inference should be of interest to philosophers. First,\nhe offers a real-time example of scientists shifting from treating a\nfeature of a system as noise to recognizing it as powerful evidence.\nPease et al. (2016) is a prime example of this. They use some of the\nnew tools developed to draw phylogenetic inference in highly\ndiscordant systems to offer a reconstruction of the tomato clade.\nWhere earlier analyses regarded the system as too noisy to pull out a\nstrong phylogenetic signal, these new models permitted a\nreconstruction that recognized specific patterns of discordance. This\nrepresents a substantial advancement in the level of resolution\nphylogeneticists are able to reconstruct and identify.\n\nSecond, the new attitudes toward discordance and reticulation in\nphylogenetics provide an example of a community of scientists shifting\nfrom one set of commitments to another. Haber (2019) offers a specific\nexample. He describes one of the entrenched core commitments in\nphylogenetic methodology as being the goal of \u201cresolving\u201d\ncompeting phylogenetic trees (Felsenstein 1988). That is, in cases\nwhere different analyses or data are generating conflicting\nphylogenetic trees, the goal should be to resolve this conflict by\nidentifying which of those trees is best supported. On a model that\nrecognizes genealogical discordance, though, conflicting trees may\naccurately reflect a reticulate or discordant phylogenetic history,\ne.g., if different data strongly support different phylogenetic trees,\none possible explanation is that we have discovered an instance of\ndiscordance. Nakhleh (2013) recommends that this entails that\nphylogeneticists must now also consider whether conflicting trees may\nbe \u201creconciled\u201d rather than resolved. Haber (2019) argues\nthat this is an example of what he calls a \u201cproductive\ndisruption\u201d, which is one way that science might advance.\n\nThe conceptual and epistemological impacts of discordance on\nphylogenetic inference come together in recent debates over Sukumaran\nand Knowles\u2019 (2017) work and commentary on the multispecies\ncoalescent (Rannala & Yang 2003; Yang & Rannala 2010). Very\nroughly, the multispecies coalescent extends the principle of the\ncoalescent from population genetics to phylogenetics. In population\ngenetics, a gene can be sampled from multiple individuals in a single\npopulation; coalescent theory provides a way to model the ancestral\nhistory of that gene to a common ancestor, i.e., where that history\ncoalesces. The multispecies coalescent does something similar, but\nwith samples from multiple populations (or even species). These and\nother techniques were developed in response to the challenge posed by\nMaddison (1997) to develop methods that recognize speciation as an\nextended process. Roughly, the lineages of genes, individual\norganisms, populations, and species within a taxa can all \u201ccome\napart\u201d, or have different phylogenetic histories, and display\n\u201ca fractal hierarchy of divergences\u201d (Sukumaran &\nKnowles 2017: 1607). Multispecies coalescent techniques help reveal\nthe fine-grained structure of complex multi-level lineages (Haber\n2012), which has generated discussion on how these internal lineage\nstructures relate to species delimitation and other phylogenetic\ninferences (e.g., de Queiroz 2007; Knowles & Carstens 2007; Haber\n2012; Carstens, Pelletier, Reid, & Satler 2013; Hahn & Nakhleh\n2016; Mallet et al. 2016; Velasco 2019).\n\nSukumaran and Knowles (2017) provide a good example of the discussions\nover what kinds of inferences are licensed by the multispecies\ncoalescent, and the way that metaphysical concerns overlap with\nepistemological ones. They focus on what kinds of inferences may be\ndrawn from multispecies coalescent methods, arguing that it is a\nmistake to simply treat the units identified by these methods as\nspecies, when they may turn out to be population-level structures\ninstead (i.e., populations of a species, rather than distinct\nspecies). They seek to highlight that mistaking population structures\nfor species (or too quickly drawing the inference of the latter from\nthe former, without further evidence), can undermine precisely the\nsorts of inferences that phylogenetics seeks to license by\nartificially and unjustifiably inflating species counts:\n\n\nSpecifically, all fields that rely on species as units of analysis,\nfrom conservation biology to studies of macroevolutionary dynamics,\nwill be impacted by inflated estimates of the number of species,\nespecially as genomic resources provide unprecedented power for\ndetecting increasingly finer-scaled genetic structure under the\nmultispecies coalescent. (Sukumaran & Knowles 2017: 1607)\n\n\nThis may be framed as a claim about the units of divergence and\ndiversification being identified by these multispecies coalescent\nmethods (a metaphysical claim), and the sorts of inferences that may\nbe drawn about those units from these methods (an epistemological\nclaim) (Haber 2019).\n\nTo be clear, the relation between the metaphysics and epistemology is\nnot direct, but oblique, yet important in regard to the inferences\nlicensed by phylogenetic methods. Sukumaran and Knowles (2017), for\nexample, conclude by issuing a plea for phylogeneticists to exercise a\nmore careful stance towards relying on genomic data alone, and in\nusing multispecies coalescent as a straight-forward way to identify\nspecies. They instead propose a more cautious inferential stance,\nidentifying the units identified by the multispecies coalescent as\npopulation-level structures (which may or may not correspond to\nspecies delimitation). This is merely an example of the rich sorts of\ndiscussions around good scientific inference that is available to\nphilosophers willing to dive into this literature.",
