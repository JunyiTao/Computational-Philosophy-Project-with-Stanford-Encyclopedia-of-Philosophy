    "main_text": "Attempted Defenses || The Appeal to Positive Evidence for the Existence of God\n6.1 The Appeal to Positive Evidence for the Existence of God\n\nIf a given, concrete formulation of the argument from evil appeals to\ncases of intrinsically undesirable states of affairs that give rise\nonly to evidential considerations, rather than to an incompatibility\nconclusion, then, although the existence of God may be improbable\nrelative to that evidence, it may not be improbable relative to one\u2019s\ntotal evidence.  Theists, however, have often contended that there\nare a variety of arguments that, even if they do not prove that God\nexists, provide positive evidence.  May not this positive evidence\noutweigh, then, the negative evidence of apparently unjustified\nevils?\n\nStarting out from this line of thought, a number of philosophers have\ngone on to claim that in order to be justified in asserting that\nthere are evils in the world that establish that it is unlikely that\nGod exists, one would first have to examine all of the\ntraditional arguments for the existence of God, and show that none of\nthem is sound. Alvin Plantinga, for example, says that in order for\nthe atheologian to show that the existence of God is improbable\nrelative to one\u2019s total evidence, \u201che would be obliged to\nconsider all the sorts of reasons natural theologians have invoked\nin favor of theistic belief\u2014the traditional\ncosmological, teleological and ontological arguments, for\nexample.\u201d (1979, 3) And in a similar vein, Bruce Reichenbach\nremarks:\n\nWith respect to the atheologian\u2019s inductive argument from evil,\nthe theist might reasonably contend that the atheologian\u2019s\nexclusion of the theistic arguments or proofs for God\u2019s\nexistence advanced by the natural theologian has skewed the\nresults. (1980, 224)\n\n\nNow it is certainly true that if one is defending a version of the\nargument from evil that supports only a probabilistic conclusion, one\nneeds to consider what sorts of positive reasons might be\noffered in support of the existence of God. But Plantinga and\nReichenbach are advancing a rather stronger claim here, for they are\nsaying that one needs to look at all of the traditional theistic\narguments, such as the cosmological and the teleological.  They are\nclaiming, in short, that if one of those arguments turned out to be\ndefensible, then it might well serve to undercut the argument from\nevil.\n\nBut this view seems mistaken. Consider the cosmological argument.  In\nsome versions, the conclusion is that there is an unmoved mover.  In\nothers, that there is a first cause. In others, that there is a\nnecessary being, having its necessity of itself. None of these\nconclusions involves any claims about the moral character of the\nentity in question, let alone the claim that it is a morally perfect\nperson.  But in the absence of such a claim, how could such\narguments, even if they turned out to be sound, serve to undercut the\nargument from evil?\n\nThe situation is not essentially different in the case of the\nargument from order, or in the case of the fine-tuning argument. For\nwhile those arguments, if they were sound, would provide grounds for\ndrawing some tentative conclusion concerning the moral character of\nthe designer or creator of the universe, the conclusion in question\nwould not be one that could be used to overthrow the argument from\nevil.  For given the mixture of good and evil that one finds in the\nworld, the argument from order can hardly provide support even for\nthe existence of a designer or creator who is very good, let alone\none who is morally perfect.  So it is very hard to see how any\nteleological argument, any more than any cosmological, could overturn\nthe argument from evil.\n\nA similar conclusion can be defended with respect to other arguments,\nsuch as those that appeal to purported miracles, or religious\nexperiences.  For while in the case of religious experiences it might\nbe argued that personal contact with a being may provide additional\nevidence concerning the person\u2019s character, it is clear that the\nprimary evidence concerning a person\u2019s character must\nconsist of information concerning what the person does and does not\ndo. So, contrary to the claim advanced by Robert Adams (1985, 245),\neven if there were veridical religious experiences, they would not\nprovide one with a satisfactory defense against the argument from\nevil.\n\nA good way of underlining the basic point here is by setting out an\nalternative formulation of the argument from evil in which it is\ngranted, for the sake of argument, that there is an omnipotent and\nomniscient person.  The result of doing this is that the conclusion at which one initially arrives is not that there is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person, but rather that, although there is an omnipotent and omniscient person, that person is not morally perfect, from which it then follows that that there is no omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect person.\n\nWhen the argument from evil is reformulated in that way, it becomes\nclear that the vast majority of considerations that have been offered\nas reasons for believing in God can be of little assistance to the\nperson who is trying to resist the argument from evil. For most of\nthem provide, at best, very tenuous grounds for any\nconclusion concerning the moral character of any omnipotent and\nomniscient being who may happen to exist, and almost none of them\nprovides any support for the hypothesis that there is an omnipotent\nand omniscient being who is also morally perfect.\n\nThe ontological argument is, of course, a notable exception, and,\nconsequently, the advocate of the argument from evil certainly needs\nto be able to show that it is unsound. But almost all of the other\nstandard arguments are simply not to the point.\n",
