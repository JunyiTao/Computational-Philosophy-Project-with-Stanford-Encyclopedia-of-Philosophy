    "main_text": "Natural Selection and Explanation || Natural Selection as a Mechanism\n4.3 Natural Selection as a Mechanism\n\nPhilosophers interested in explanation have recently turned their\nattention to mechanisms: \u201cmechanisms are sought to explain how a\nphenomenon comes about or how some significant process works\u201d\n(Machamer, Darden, & Craver 2000: 2). One way to secure\nexplanatory status for selection would be to show that it functions as\na mechanism. Whether natural selection qualifies as a mechanism is\ncontroversial. Skipper and Millstein gainsay the position: natural\nselection not organized in the right sort of way to count as a\nmechanism, exhibits a lack of productive continuity between stages,\nand further lacks the requisite sort regularity of operation (Skipper\n& Millstein 2005: 335). Barros (2008) has argued that natural\nselection may be characterized as a two-level mechanism, with a\npopulation-level mechanism and an individual-level mechanism working\ntogether. Havstad (2011) responds that the account Barros offers is\ntoo general and so includes any selective process, not just natural\nselection. Moreover, the parts/entities and activities/interactions\nthat supposedly make-up the mechanism of selection can only be\nspecified by the roles in the selective process, whereas mechanistic\nexplanation works by associating these roles with specific phenomena\n(Havstad 2011: 522\u2013523). Matthews (2016) offers a case study of\nthe debate over selection as a mechanism, while DesAutels (2016)\nprovides a defense of a mechanistic view.\n",
