    "main_text": "Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views\n4. Dilemmas and Two-Norm Views\n\nWe began by discussing a puzzle raised by higher-order evidence: it\nseems that agents in situations like Hypoxia should reduce confidence,\nbut also that if they do, they will be ignoring evidence in a\nproblematic way. We have seen some arguments against reducing\nconfidence, and some proposals for how Aisha should reduce\nconfidence. But some epistemologists think that neither of these\npossibilities gives us the full story. Maybe level-bridging principles\nare genuine rational requirements, but there is still\nsomething wrong with Aisha if she reduces confidence. Or maybe they\nare not genuine rational requirements, yet there is something\nelse wrong with Aisha if she does not reduce\nconfidence. Maybe they are both rational requirements, and Aisha is\nfacing an epistemic dilemma. (An alternative way to frame the puzzle\nfocuses on epistemic akrasia: maybe Aisha is rationally required to be\nepistemically akratic in her situation, but there is something else\nwrong with her if she is epistemically akratic, and so forth.)\n\nThis section discusses two strategies which acknowledge the remaining\npuzzle and attempt to solve it. One, defended most prominently by\nDavid Christensen, holds that higher-order evidence gives rise to\nepistemic dilemmas, where there is no fully rational response\navailable (though there may be a rationally best response). So Aisha\nis both required to believe G and to doubt G, and\nshe is just unfortunately unable to do both. Another family of\nresponses, here called \u201ctwo-norm views\u201d, aim to separate\ndifferent modes of epistemic evaluation, and argue that Aisha\u2019s\nconflicting requirements somehow issue from different normative\nrealms. The common goal of all these strategies is to explain the\napparent conflict of norms in cases like Hypoxia, without denying the\nlegitimacy of any of these conflicting norms.\n",
