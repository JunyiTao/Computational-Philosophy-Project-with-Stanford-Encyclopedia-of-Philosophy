Classic Work (1961\u20131966)\n\nWith the perspective afforded by the mass of posthumous writings\npublished since the 1990s, it has become clear that Althusser was\nperennially concerned with important issues in metaphysics,\nepistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, hermeneutics, and\npolitical philosophy. However, it is also true that the primary medium\nAlthusser employed for thinking through problems in these areas was\nMarxist philosophy. This is especially true of the period between 1961\nand 1966 when the majority of his published and unpublished work\nconcerned itself with how to read Marx, the definition of Marxist\nphilosophy, and how to understand and apply Marxian concepts. In\naddition, if we are to take Althusser\u2019s retrospective word for\nit, the pieces he published during this period were intended as\npolitical-theoretical acts, polemics meant to respond to contemporary\nopinions and policies and to shift the terms of these arguments as\nwell as the actions which were their results. For these reasons, it is\nnatural when discussing these texts to focus upon the contexts that\nengendered them and upon the positions within Marxist philosophy that\nAlthusser stakes out by their means. Alternatively, as Althusser\nindicates in many of these pieces his debts to contemporaneous\ntheorists and to philosophical predecessors such as Spinoza, there is\nthe temptation to understand his thought as a combination of the\ninsights contributed by these thinkers with Marxist philosophy. While\neach is a useful approach to understanding and explaining\nAlthusser\u2019s philosophy, when excessive attention is paid to one\nor another of them, one risks historicizing his contributions or\nsuggesting that they are merely derivative. Seeking to avoid either\nresult, even though the following discussion will note the context for\nAlthusser\u2019s work, its relation to Marxist philosophy, and the\nnon-Marxist philosophical insights that contribute to its method and\nconclusions, this account will also suggest the uniqueness of his\ncontributions to hermeneutics, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy\nof science, historiography, and political philosophy.\n\nFor multiple, overlapping, and complicated reasons of which the most\nrelevant may be the discrediting of Stalin\u2019s personage,\npolicies, and version of Marxist philosophy that followed\nKhrushchev\u2019s \u201cSecret Speech,\u201d Europe in the late\n1950s saw a blossoming of political and philosophical alternatives to\nthe version of Marxism-Leninism promulgated by the Soviet Union. This\nversion of Marxist philosophy had dominated European leftist thought\nand action since the dawn of the Cold War in 1947 and, in France, was\nwidely disseminated via Communist Party schools and literature. While\npolitical and philosophical change were slow to occur in the French\nCommunist Party, by the late 1950s, many intellectuals associated with\nthe Party began to ask questions about what constitutes the core of\nMarx\u2019s philosophy and about how this philosophy guides, relates\nto, or allows for political action.\n\nFor many of these intellectuals, answering this question meant a\nreturn to Marx\u2019s early work (those texts written before 1845) in\nthe hopes of finding the \u201ckey\u201d to his philosophy. In\npieces like \u201cContribution to the Critique of Hegel\u2019s\nPhilosophy of Right\u201d (1844), and the Economic and\nPhilosophic Manuscripts (1844), these thinkers found and\nchampioned a Marx obviously indebted to a Hegelian dialectical\nunderstanding of subjectivity and historical development and deeply\nconcerned about ending human alienation. It is to this\nproject\u2014that of finding the true method, aim, and intent of\nMarx\u2019s philosophy in his early work\u2019s emphasis on the\nrealization of full human freedom and potentials through dialectical\nhistorical change\u2014that Althusser made the first of his public\n\u201cinterventions\u201d into Marxist philosophy. He inaugurated\nthis effort with the essay \u201cOn the Young Marx\u201d (1961),\nwhich sought to demonstrate that this method of looking to\nMarx\u2019s early work for the key to his philosophy was\nmethodologically suspect and ideologically driven. Further, in this\nessay and in subsequent work, he developed an alternate method of\ninvestigation or \u201creading\u201d that would allow Marx\u2019s\ntrue philosophy to be revealed in its purity.\n\nFrom the fruits of this new method of reading, Althusser argued that\nnot only was Marx the originator of a new philosophy, Dialectical\nMaterialism, that had nothing to do with its Hegelian and Feuerbachian\npredecessors, but that he also founded a new science, Historical\nMaterialism, which broke with and superseded such ideological and\npre-scientific precursors as the political economics of Smith and\nRicardo. For the most part, the essays collected in For Marx\n(1965) and the seminar papers issued as Reading Capital\n(1965) develop and utilize this method of reading in order to justify\nand describe Marxist philosophy and Marxist science as well as to\ndistinguish between these two theoretical activities. In so doing,\nAlthusser says quite a bit about the nature of knowledge and the\ngeneral relations between philosophy, science, politics, and ideology.\nFurther, Althusser applies this hermeneutic method to argue against\nwhat he labeled \u201cempiricist\u201d understandings of Marx. These\nincluded the Humanist interpretations of Marx described above as well\nas variations on the orthodox Marxist-Leninist theory, which specified\nthe strict determination of culture and history by the existing modes\nof economic exchange and resulting class struggles. The following\nparagraphs discuss this theory of reading, how it produces a different\nunderstanding of Marx\u2019s philosophy than that which is derived\nfrom Humanist and Economist readings, and how it informs his\nepistemology, philosophy of science, historiography, and political\nphilosophy.\n",
