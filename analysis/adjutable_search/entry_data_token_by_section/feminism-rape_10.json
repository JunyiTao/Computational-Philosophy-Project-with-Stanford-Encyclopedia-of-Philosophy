    "main_text": "The Wrongs and Harms of Rape || War rape and genocidal rape\n3.4 War rape and genocidal rape\n\nRape is a common, indeed arguably universal, form of abuse in war. It\ntakes many forms, including the mass rape of female civilians as\nrecreation and/or as a prize for military victory, the mass rape of\nfemale civilians as a strategy or weapon of war, and the enslavement\nof women and girls to provide sexual service for soldiers and\nofficers. The latter is frequently practiced both by official armies\n(as in the enslavement of mostly Korean and Chinese women and girls by\nJapanese forces during World War II) and by rebel militias (as in the\nabduction of women and girls as \u201cbush wives\u201d for rebels in\nSierra Leone). Additionally, as more women enter military forces, the\nrape of military women by their own male colleagues is an increasingly\nreported abuse (Jeffreys 2007).\n\nSeifert criticizes the common view of rape as simply a regrettable\nbyproduct of wartime social breakdown and lack of military discipline\n(as well as of naturally aggressive male sexuality), contending that,\nin fact, rape is a routine element of military strategy, aimed at\nundermining the will, morale, cohesion, and self-conception of the\nenemy population. She observes that, during wartime,\n\nthe women are those who hold the families and communities together.\nTheir physical and emotional destruction aims at destroying social and\ncultural stability \u2026. in many cultures [the female body]\nembodies the nation as a whole \u2026. The rape of women of a\ncommunity, culture, or nation can be regarded \u2026 as a symbolic\nrape of the body of that community. (1996, 39)\n\n\nIt is thus not surprising that rape in war often involves heightened\nsadism, as well as additional abuses such as forcing men to watch the\nrape of their wives or daughters and forcing women to engage in sex\nwith their own sons, brothers, or other family members. In these and\nother cases, according to MacKinnon, the rape of female civilians is\noften \u201ca humiliation rite for the men on the other side who\ncannot (in masculinity\u2019s terms) \u2018protect\u2019 their\nwomen. Many of these acts make women\u2019s bodies into a medium of\nmen\u2019s expression, the means through which one group of men says\nwhat it wants to say to another\u201d (2006, 223).\n\nBecause rape in war frequently seeks to undermine and destroy bonds of\nfamily, community, and culture, there are important points of\nconnection between rape in war and genocidal rape (Nenadic 2011).\nGenocide is the attempt to destroy a racial, ethnic, religious, or\nnational group as such, in whole or in part, by committing any of a\nnumber of acts against the group\u2019s members; the acts include not\nonly killing, but also causing serious bodily or mental harm, creating\nconditions of life intended to destroy the group physically, and\nimposing restrictions intended to prevent births within the group.\nWhen such acts are committed with genocidal intent, the victim is not\nonly the individual targeted, but the group itself. As Sarah Clark\nMiller observes, rape is an extraordinarily effective genocidal\nstrategy, since it \u201ccorrupts women\u2019s roles as caretakers\nof relationships, conveyors of cultural practices, and sustainers of\nmeaning \u2026 . In these ways, genocidal rapists twist the way in\nwhich women are pivotal to the life of a community, rendering them\npivotal to its destruction\u201d (Miller 2009, 513\u2013514).\n\nGenocidal rape has been recognized and condemned by both the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY)\n(Askin 2003, Nenadic 2011). In both cases, rape was employed\nsystematically against the women of a certain group, as part of an\norganized campaign to destroy that group. In Rwanda, the\ninterahamwe raped hundreds of thousands of women and girls\nbelonging to the Tutsi ethnic group, as part of an effort to\nexterminate the Tutsi people entirely. MacKinnon describes the\ngenocidal rape of Muslim and Croatian women in Bosnia-Herzegovina\nas\n\nethnic rape as an official policy of war in a genocidal campaign for\npolitical control \u2026. It is specifically rape under orders\n\u2026. It is also rape unto death, rape as massacre, rape to kill\nand to make the victims wish they were dead. It is rape as an\ninstrument of forced exile, rape to make you leave your home and never\nwant to go back \u2026. It is rape to drive a wedge through a\ncommunity, to shatter a society, to destroy a people. (2006, 187)\n\n\nThe Serbian mass rape campaign was distinguished not only by its\nextraordinary brutality and notorious \u201crape camps,\u201d but\nalso by the systematic forced impregnation of Muslim and Croatian\nwomen and girls. The aim was to claim and colonize the women\u2019s\nbodies reproductively as well as sexually, while increasing the\npopulation of children identified as Serb: \u201cCroatian and Muslim\nwomen [were] being raped, and then denied abortions, to help make a\nSerbian state by making what the perpetrators imagine[d] as Serb\nbabies\u201d (MacKinnon 2006, 188). Goodhart points out that in such\nforced impregnation, the soldiers\u2019 (and their commanders\u2019)\nhope is to \u201ccreate a baby (a son) who will infiltrate,\nundermine, or destroy the mother\u2019s group\u201d (2007, 309). The\nresulting children are in fact seen by the maternal community as\n\u201cchildren of the enemy \u2026 a sort of nascent fifth column\nwithin an already victimized community\u201d (310) and are thus often\nstigmatized, mistreated, or abandoned. Goodhart argues that the\nrapist-fathers have violated the rights not only of the women they\nrape, but also of the children thereby produced. The rapists are\nguilty of wrongful procreation, a \u201cdeliberate, malicious, and\nsadistic\u201d use of procreative power with the intent of creating a\nchild who is unlikely to be able to enjoy his or her human rights\n(317-18).\n\nSome have puzzled over how war rape aimed at enforced pregnancy and\nbirth can be genocidal, since it aims to produce rather than prevent\nbirths within the targeted population. In the case of mass rapes in\nBosnia, some Serb perpetrators may have believed they were producing\n\u201clittle Chetniks [Serbs].\u201d But Claudia Card points out\nthat such a belief, even if sincerely held, does not provide good\ngrounds for regarding these rapes as genocidal, since \u201cin terms\nof biological parentage, the child will be as much non-Serb as Serb,\nand the child\u2019s culture will almost certainly not be\nSerbian\u201d (2008, 184). Thus, she seeks to explain the genocidal\nnature of rape aimed at enforced pregnancy without appealing to\nperpetrators\u2019 beliefs about the ethnic identity of any resulting\nchildren. A better explanation, in her view, emphasizes that the\nSerbian campaign of forced impregnation \u201cimposed a social death\non its victims \u2026 it turned them into living (and gestating)\ncorpses. \u2026 Whether the perpetrators thought they were producing\nlittle Serbs is irrelevant. What counts is the attack on the social\nmeanings of the lives of the women they tortured\u201d (185). Card\nalso develops and expands Beverly Allen\u2019s proposal (1996) that\nmilitary rape aimed at enforced pregnancy employs sperm as a weapon of\nbiological warfare. Such attacks meet the criteria for biological\nwarfare found in international documents, she points out, since\n\na product of a living organism (the rapist) is used to attack a\nbiological system (the reproductive system) in members of the enemy\npopulation. Although this attack need not produce illness, it is\ndesigned to produce social chaos \u2026 . Sperm so used becomes a\nsocial and psychological toxin, poisoning the futures of victims and\ntheir communities by producing children who, if they survive, will\nremind whoever raised them of their traumatic origins in torture.\n\u2026 Unlike bacteria and viruses, sperm is easily containable,\nstorable, preservable, and deliverable by means of men\u2019s bodies.\n(187)\n\n\nSchott takes a different approach to explaining the genocidal nature\nof military rape aimed at enforced pregnancy, drawing centrally on\nHannah Arendt\u2019s concept of natality. War rape aimed at forced\nimpregnation, Schott observes, \u201c[transforms] birth into a weapon\nof death. This is so for women who are raped, who lose a sense of\nbeing at home in their own bodies and of having a future, and it is so\nfor the children born of forced maternity, who may suffer expulsion\nfrom the mother\u2019s community\u201d (2011, 14). Thus such rape\nundermines natality, or the capacity for new beginnings, which Arendt\nregarded as fundamental to human political life. Thus, Schott\ncontends, \u201cwar rape can be understood not only as a tool for the\nunmaking of the social and cultural world, but also a tool for the\nunmaking of the political world\u201d (2009, 86).\n\nRape is used as an instrument of genocide because it is extremely\neffective in doing what genocides do: destroying not only individual\ngroup members, but \u201cthat aspect of the group whole that is more\nthan the sum of its individual parts \u2026 the substance and glue\nof community that lives on when individual members die\u201d\n(MacKinnon 2006, 225). This is especially true when the rapes leave\nchildren motherless, the victims with AIDS, other diseases,\ninfertility, fistulas, and/or other internal injuries, and families\nbroken as victims are abandoned and shunned by their husbands or other\nrelatives. Even absent these additional harms, however, sexual assault\nmay be especially well suited to creating a kind of self-annihilating\nshame in its victims, a shame that can focus on one\u2019s group\nidentity. MacKinnon points out that\n\nsexual atrocities can reasonably produce revulsion to the identity\nthat marked the person for the intimate violation, making the raped\nwant to abandon who they are forever. When the shared identity for\nwhich one is raped is ruined, shattered in oneself and relationally\nbetween oneself and others, the group quality of the group so defined\nis destroyed. (229)\n\n\nSmith underlines this point, and its special applicability to\ngenocidal contexts, observing that \u201cin my experience as a rape\ncrisis counselor, every Native survivor I ever counseled said to me at\none point, \u2018I wish I was no longer Indian\u2019\u201d (2005,\n8).\n\nIn February 2001, the ICTY found three Serbian soldiers guilty of rape\nas a crime against humanity. Crimes against humanity are certain\nextraordinarily inhumane acts (including murder, torture, enslavement,\nand deportation) when those acts are systematically committed against\ncivilian populations in the course of armed conflict. The ICTY\njudgment marked international humanitarian law\u2019s first official\nrecognition of rape as a crime against humanity. According to\nCampbell,\n\nthe axiological foundation of the crime against humanity \u2026 lies\nin a conception of a fundamental trauma to a social body, which\nconsists of the denial of the humanity of others. This model of rape\nas a crime against humanity therefore involves not only a physical and\npsychic trauma to the subject but also a symbolic trauma to\n\u201chumanity.\u201d (2003, 510)\n\n\nThe ICTY verdict thus conveyed a judgment that the Serbian\nperpetrators of mass rape, in addition to violating their individual\nvictims and damaging the cultural and religious groups to which those\nvictims belonged, also insulted and injured humanity as such. Debra\nBergoffen (2012) points out that, in addition, the ICTY verdict\ncreated a new human right to sexual self-determination--a right\ngrounded neither in the agency of an autonomous and inviolable subject\n(implicitly gendered male) nor in an assumed feminine weakness needing\nmale protection, but rather in the dignity of a humanly shared\nvulnerability.\n",
