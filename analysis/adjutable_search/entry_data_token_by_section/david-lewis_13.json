    "main_text": "Humean Supervenience\n5. Humean Supervenience\n\nMany of David Lewis\u2019s papers in metaphysics were devoted to\nsetting out, and defending, a doctrine he called \u201cHumean\nSupervenience\u201d. Here is Lewis\u2019s succinct statement of the\nview.\n\nIt is the doctrine that all there is to the world is a vast mosaic of\nlocal matters of particular fact, just one little thing and then\nanother. (Lewis 1986b: ix)\n\n\nThe doctrine can be factored into two distinct theses. The first is\nthe thesis that, in John Bigelow\u2019s words, \u201ctruth\nsupervenes on being\u201d. That is, all the truths about a world\n supervene\n on the distribution of perfectly natural properties and relations in\nthat world. The second is the thesis that the perfectly natural\nproperties and relations in this world are\n intrinsic properties\n of point-sized objects, and spatiotemporal relations. Lewis held that\nthe first of these was necessary and a priori. (See, for instance,\n\u201cParts of Classes\u201d (1991a), \u201cReduction of\nMind\u201d, \u201cTruthmaking and Difference-making\u201d (2001d).)\nThe second is contingently true if true at all. Indeed, modern physics\nsuggests that it is not true (Maudlin 2007: Ch. 2). Lewis was aware of\nthis. His aim in defending Humean supervenience was to defend, as he\nput it, its \u201ctenability\u201d (1986a: xi). We will return at\nthe end of this section to the question of why he might have wanted to\ndo this. For now, we will focus on how he went about this project.\n\nThe primary challenge to Humean supervenience comes from those who\nhold that providing a subvenient basis for all the truths of this\nworld requires more than intrinsic properties of point-sized objects\nand spatiotemporal relations. Some of these challenges come from\ntheorists who think best physics will need non-spatiotemporal\nrelations in order to explain\n Bell\u2019s Theorem.\n But more commonly it comes from those who think that grounding the\nmodal, the nomic or the mental requires adding properties and\nrelations to any Humean mosaic constructed from properties found in\nfundamental physics. (I\u2019m using \u2018mental\u2019 here to\ncover all the properties that Lewis considered mental, broadly\nconstrued. This includes contents, since Lewis thought content was\ngrounded in mental content, and value, since he thought values were\ngrounded in idealised desires. So it\u2019s a fairly broad category,\nand there is a lot that isn\u2019t obviously reducible to fundamental\nphysics. As we\u2019ll see, Lewis attempts to reduce it all\nstep-by-step.)\n\nWe\u2019ve discussed in the previous section how Lewis aimed to\nreduce the mental to the nomic. (Or at least much of it; we\u2019ll\nreturn to the question of value in section 7.5.) We\u2019ll discuss\nin the next section his distinctive modal metaphysics. In this section\nwe\u2019ll look at how he attempted to locate the nomic in the Humean\nmosaic. Lewis\u2019s aim was to show that nomic properties and\nrelations could be located in the Humean mosaic by locating them as\nprecisely and as explicitly as he could. So the location project\nrevealed a lot about these nomic features. We\u2019ll spend the next\ntwo subsections looking at the two important parts of this project.\nNotably, they are two parts where Lewis refined his views several\ntimes on the details of the location.\n",
