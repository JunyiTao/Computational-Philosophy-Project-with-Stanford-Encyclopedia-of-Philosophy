    "main_text": "Philosophy of Logic || Philosophy of Logic and the Logistic Method\n2.1 Philosophy of Logic and the Logistic Method\n\nIn Church\u2019s philosophy of logic, the phenomenon of deductive\nreasoning is assumed to be \u201calready known, from experience with\nparticular instances of it\u201d and the stated goal of logic is to\nprovide a theory of such reasoning\n\n\nplus whatever is required in object language or metalanguage for the\nadequacy, generality, and simplicity of the theory. (1962b [BE:\n608])\n\n\nThis attitude required Church to accept not only first order logic but\nalso the logic of second and higher orders, so that he could study\nlogic in all its generality. It was not enough to accept, for example,\n\u201c\\((x) F(x) \\supset F(y)\\)\u201d, because there are infinitely\nmany sentences of this form requiring one to also accept\n\u201c\\((F)(y) \\hdot (x) F(x) \\supset F(y)\\)\u201d \u201cby\ngeneralization from infinitely many analytic sentences of the\nappropriate form\u201d (1962b [BE: 608]). (Note Church\u2019s\nnotational convention that a dot placed before a connective or (as\nabove) a quantifier brackets a proposition.)\n\nAnother consideration Church offered in favor of second order logic\nwas the more pragmatic one that a greater understanding of\nmathematical theories could be obtained by comparing their\nformulations in first and second order languages (1956a: chapter V).\n(Discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this entry; but see\nMyhill (1953), Shapiro (1991, 2001), Button and Walsh (2018) and the\ncitations therein. See also the entries on\n model theory,\n second and higher order logic, and\n Skolem\u2019s Paradox.)\n\nChurch\u2019s philosophy of logic was shaped not only on the one hand\nby a belief in the generality of logic but also on the other by the\nneed to avoid the paradoxes to be discussed in\n section 4.\n In order to avoid the paradoxes to which Frege\u2019s position lead,\nChurch was forced to work primarily within a type-theoretic\nframework\u2014the logic of second, third and higher orders up to and\nincluding w\u2014with different kinds of variables, with\ndifferent restricted domains of individuals, classes, relations, etc.\n(Church\u2019s type theory is described in\n supplement D.)\n Moreover, as we will now see, Church departed even further from Frege\nand Russell by presenting these ideas in terms of conventional model\ntheory.\n\nThe purpose of formal logic, in Church\u2019s view, was first and\nforemost to study the form of correct deductive reasoning in\nabstraction from its subject matter (1956a: \u00a700). For Church,\ndeductive reasoning operates on propositions, and so the study of such\nreasoning is the study of the logical form of propositions\u2014which\nChurch distinguished from their \u201ccontent\u201d or\n\u201cmatter\u201d (ibid)\u2014via the study of the logical forms\nof sentences that express them (ibid; cf. 1959 [BE: 475]). This way of\nstudying logical form invoked what Church called the \u201clogistic\nmethod\u201d (1956a). This required him to distinguish between\ninformal languages and formalized languages, because\n\n\nthe natural languages, including English, have been evolved over a\nlong period of history to serve practical purposes of facility of\ncommunication, and these are not always compatible with soundness and\nprecision of logical analysis\u2026 To adopt a particular language\nthus involves adopting a particular theory or system of logical\nanalysis. (1956a: \u00a700)\n\n\nIn order to adopt a formal language, one first devises what Church\ncalls \u201ca particular theory or system\u201d (1956a [BE: 373]),\nwhich is a syntactic theory. This specifies the primitive\nsymbols and formation rules for building the\nwell-formed expressions (the wffs) of the theory, as well as what\nare the axioms and inference rules. The\ntheorems are the wffs that occur at the end of\nproofs, which are themselves specified as finite sequences of\nwffs that are either axioms or inferable from prior wffs in the\nsequence according to the inference rules. In order for this theory to\nserve as a language, it must be provided with semantic rules\nthat assign designata (or denotations) to the names of the\ntheory, as well as values to expressions containing free\noccurrences of variables.\n\nThe logical forms of sentences are the ways that sentences are built\nup from the logical particles. From this perspective, to say that a\nwff B is a logical consequence of a set of wffs \\(\\Sigma\\) is\nto say that the logical forms of B and the wffs in \\(\\Sigma\\) are so\nrelated that if the wffs in \\(\\Sigma\\) are true, so is B. Moreover,\nsince logical form is sufficient to ensure this, for any argument of\nthe same logical form, if the premises are true, so is the\nconclusion. This leads to the now familiar idea that\n\n\nthe proof of a theorem (of the object language) shall make no\nreference to or use of any interpretation, but shall proceed purely by\nthe rules of the logistic system. (1956a: \u00a707)\n\n\nChurch gave three reasons for this requirement. First, it adheres to\nextant standards of mathematical rigor. Secondly, reasoning purely by\nthe rules of the logistic system is safer than reasoning about any\ninterpretation one may wish to adopt, because\u2014as is discussed in\n2.2\u2014the object language is set up using an informal\nmeta-language that is \u201cso elementary and restricted that its\nessential reliability can hardly be doubted if mathematics is to be\npossible at all\u201d (1956a [BE: 415]). Finally, it allows one to\ndraw a precise distinction between form and content:\n\nReturning to B and \\(\\Sigma\\), if the former is a logical consequence\nof the latter, then, if we do not reinterpret the logical\nparticles but do reinterpret the nonlogical vocabulary by\nassociating it with different rules, then it will still be the case\nthat if all the wffs in \\(\\Sigma\\) are true, so is B. In this way, we\ncan isolate the form of a proposition by studying the corresponding\nsentence and reinterpreting its non-logical vocabulary.\n\nThis, of course, is the now conventional model-theoretic treatment of\nlogical consequence originally due to Tarski (1937 [1941]) and\nextended to the logic of higher orders by Church\u2019s student Leon\nHenkin (1950), which is presented in Church (1956a). (For more on\nHenkin\u2019s contribution, see the entries on\n second and higher order logic\n and on\n Church\u2019s type theory.)\n It should be noted that Church, in addition to working in classical\nmodel theory with restricted universes that can be accommodated in ZF\nset theory, was also willing to allow the existence of a universal set\n(1974c). Further, he not only distinguished between sharply between\nmodel theoretic interpretations and intended interpretations (1956a),\nbut also argued that giving a particular model theoretic\ninterpretation of a formal language was not sufficient for describing\nits logic. In particular, he argued that giving a formal language\ncontaining empty names (like \u2018Pegasus\u2019) an interpretation\nwith inner and outer domains that invalidates Existential\nGeneralization (as well as, presumably, Universal Instantiation) was\nnot sufficient for describing the logic of that language (1965).\n",
