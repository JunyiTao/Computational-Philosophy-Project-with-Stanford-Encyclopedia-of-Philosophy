    "main_text": "Answering the Evaluation Question || Manipulation and Harm\n3.2 Manipulation and Harm\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward way to explain the wrongfulness of\nmanipulation (when it is wrong) would point to the harm done to its\ntargets. Manipulation is commonly used aggressively, as a way to harm\nthe manipulator\u2019s target, or at least to benefit the manipulator\nat the target\u2019s expense. The harmfulness of manipulation seems\nespecially salient in manipulative relationships, where manipulation\nmay lead to subordination and even abuse. The more minor economic harm\nof the extraction of money from consumers might be cited as a\nwrong-making feature of manipulative advertising, and there has been\nsome discussion of how manipulation might lead targets to enter into\nexploitative contracts. Systematic political manipulation may weaken\ndemocratic institutions and perhaps even lead to tyranny.\n\nBut not all instances of manipulation harm their victims. In fact,\nmanipulation sometimes benefits its target. If the harm to the victim\nis the only wrong-making feature of manipulation, then paternalistic\nor beneficent manipulation could never be even pro tanto\nwrong. But this claim strikes most people as implausible. To see this,\nconsider that the debate about whether paternalistic nudges are\nwrongfully manipulative is not settled simply by pointing out that\nthey benefit their targets. The fact that it seems possible for an act\nto be wrongfully manipulative, even though it benefits (and is\nintended to benefit) the target, presumably explains why there are\nfew, if any, defenses of the claim that manipulation is wrong\nonly when and because it harms the target. Nevertheless, it\nseems plausible to hold that when manipulation does harm its target,\nthis harm adds to the wrongness of the manipulative behavior.\n",
