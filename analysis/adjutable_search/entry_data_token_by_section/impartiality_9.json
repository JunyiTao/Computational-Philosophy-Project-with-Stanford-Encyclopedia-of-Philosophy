    "main_text": "Moral impartiality II: Deontological moral theories || Other Deontological Approaches\n4.3 Other Deontological Approaches\n\nThe Universalizability Formulation is one of four formulations of the\ncategorical imperative Kant provided, and some recent Kantian\ntheorists have de-emphasized it, placing more weight on other\nformulations. Houston Smit and Mark Timmons suggest that the\nhumanity formulation, \u201cwhich commands individuals to treat\nhumanity as an end in itself, never merely as a means\u201d (2017,\n175) be read as attributing to autonomous beings an \u201celevated\nstatus of dignity\u201d which \u201cis something all rational agents\npossess (and possess equally) as far as dignity qua autonomous agents\ngoes [\u2026]. This equal status is the basis of a principle of moral\nequality\u201d (187). This in turn implies two principles\nof impartiality. The positive principle of impartiality states that\n\u201cone is to adopt maxims and perform corresponding actions that\nmanifest a positive concern for the ends [especially the needs] of\nothers.\u201d The negative principle of impartiality states that\n\u201cone is to avoid adopting maxims or performing actions that\nmanifest a negative concern for the ends (especially the needs) of\nothers.\u201d Both of these principles, they point out,\n\u201cconcern the welfare of persons.\u201d (187\u20138) Smit and\nTimmons go on to argue that these principles of impartiality imply a\nduty of beneficence which \u201cinvolves adopting an unselfish maxim\nthat disposes one to promote the well-being of others in need without,\nas Kant says, \u2018hoping for something in return.\u2019\u201d\n(206) There is some common ground here with utilitarian approaches,\nthough of course on a Kantian account the duty of beneficence is an\nimperfect duty: one need not do everything one can by way of helping\nothers in need in order to demonstrate the proper sort of respect for\nthe humanity of others. (This leaves open, of course, the question of\njust how much one is required to do.)\n\nMany moral theorists, including Kant himself, have noted similarities\nbetween his universalizability formulation of the categorical\nimperative and the Golden Rule (\u201cWe ought to treat others as we\nwould want others to treat us,\u201d in Derek Parfit\u2019s\nformulation (2011, I, 321). Kant himself argued that the\nuniversalizability formulation was superior, though some have\ndisagreed. Parfit argues that Kant\u2019s reasons for rejecting the\nGolden Rule are generally unconvincing, and largely relied on\nKant\u2019s smuggling his own assumptions into the presuppositions of\nthe rule. Ultimately, Parfit argues for a principle that combines the\nfundamental insight of the Golden Rule with elements of\nuniversalizability and contractualism, which he calls \u201cthe\nKantian Contractualist Formula\u201d: \u201cEveryone ought to follow\nthe principles whose universal acceptance everyone could rationally\nwill.\u201d \u201cThis formula,\u201d he writes, \u201cmight be\nwhat Kant was trying to find: the supreme principle of morality\u201d\n(2011, I, 321).\n\nOther deontologists have emphasized the importance of seeing morality\nas fundamentally interpersonal in nature. Paul Hurley (2009) argues\nthat consequentialists misconstrue moral impartiality by interpreting\nit as fundamentally impersonal: \u201cwhereas the impersonal\nconception captures a form of equal concern for persons that is\nappropriate, in the first instance, for the evaluation of overall\nstates of affairs as better or worse, this interpersonal conception of\nimpartiality is relevant, in the first instance, to the evaluation of\npotential courses of action as right or wrong. [\u2026] Moreover, such a\nfundamental role for interpersonal impartiality in the moral\nevaluation of actions provides a rationale for the agent-centered\nrestrictions and permissions that are central to ordinary\nmorality.\u201d (Hurley 2009, 179) Although this interpersonal\nstandpoint does not offer an agent-neutral ranking of outcomes, and\nthus \u201cgenerates agent-centered reasons and claims, reasons and\nclaims to do and not to do, not to prevent or promote overall\noutcomes,\u201d Hurley argues that it nevertheless captures a robust\nand substantial understanding of moral impartiality\u2014an\nunderstanding, moreover, that fits our ordinary moral beliefs and\npractices and better accommodates the rational authority of morality\nthan the agent-neutral impersonal framework endorsed by\nconsequentialism. \u201cIf practical reason has a fundamentally\ninterpersonal structure, then it is structured by an equal concern by\neach person for each other person. Each person has an independent\nrational significance that is reflected explicitly in reasons that\nothers have not to interfere with them, and in claims that each person\nhas not to be interfered with by any other person\u201d (Hurley 2009,\n220).\n",
