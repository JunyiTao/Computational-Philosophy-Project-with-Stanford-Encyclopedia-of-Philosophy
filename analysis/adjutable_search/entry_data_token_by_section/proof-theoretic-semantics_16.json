    "main_text": "Extensions and alternatives to standard proof-theoretic semantics || Hypothetical reasoning\n3.6 Hypothetical reasoning\n\nStandard approaches to proof-theoretic semantics, especially\nPrawitz\u2019s validity-based approach (section\n 2.2.2),\n take closed derivations as basic. The validity of open derivations is\ndefined as the transmission of validity from closed derivations of the\nassumptions to a closed derivation of the assertion, where the latter\nis obtained by substituting a closed derivation for an open\nassumption. Therefore, if one calls closed derivations\n\u2018categorical\u2019 and open derivations\n\u2018hypothetical\u2019, one may characterize this approach as\nfollowing two fundamental ideas: (I) The primacy of the categorical\nover the hypothetical, (II) the transmission view of consequence.\nThese two assumptions (I) and (II) may be viewed as dogmas of\nstandard semantics. \u201cStandard semantics\u201d here not\nonly means standard proof-theoretic semantics, but also classical\nmodel-theoretic semantics, where these dogmas are assumed as well.\nThere one starts with the definition of truth, which is the\ncategorical concept, and defines consequence, the hypothetical\nconcept, as the transmission of truth from conditions to consequent.\nFrom this point of view, constructive semantics, including\nproof-theoretic semantics, exchange the concept of truth with a\nconcept of construction or proof, and interpret\n\u201ctransmission\u201d in terms of a constructive function or\nprocedure, but otherwise leave the framework untouched.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in principle with these dogmas. However, there\nare phenomena that are difficult to deal with in the standard\nframework. Such a phenomenon is non-wellfoundedness, especially\ncircularity, where we may have consequences without transmission of\ntruth and provability (see section\n 3.8).\n Another phenomenon are substructural distinctions, where it is\ncrucial to include the structuring of assumptions from the very\nbeginning (see section\n 3.10).\n Moreover, and this is most crucial, we might define things in a\ncertain way without knowing in advance of whether our definition or\nchain of definitions is well-founded or not. We do not first involve\nourselves into the metalinguistic study of the definition we start\nwith, but would like to start to reason immediately. This problem does\nnot obtain if we restrict ourselves to the case of logical constants,\nwhere the defining rules are trivially well-founded. But the problem\narises immediately, when we consider more complicated cases that go\nbeyond logical constants.\n\nThis makes it worthwhile to proceed in the other direction and start\nwith the hypothetical concept of consequence, i.e., characterize\nconsequence directly without reducing it to the categorical case.\nPhilosophically this means that the categorical concept is a limiting\nconcept of the hypothetical one. In the classical case, truth would be\na limiting case of consequence, namely consequence without hypotheses.\nThis program is closely related to the approach of categorial proof\ntheory (see section\n 2.5),\n which is based on the primacy of hypothetical entities\n(\u201carrows\u201d). Formally, it would give preference to the\nsequent calculus over natural deduction, since the sequent calculus\nallows the manipulation of the assumption side of a sequence by means\nof left-introduction rules. In a term-annotated system, we would not\nannotate formulas, but hypothetical statements by terms. If a\nhypothetical statement is expressed by a sequent in the form \\(A\n\\vdash B\\), we would not annotate it as \\(x{:}A \\vdash t(x){:}B\\) as\nin the Curry-Howard correspondence, but in a way like \\(f{:}(A \\vdash\nB)\\). That is, the full hypothetical statement would be annotated,\nwhich makes the parallel to the categorial approach, where \\(f\\) would\nbe the arrow \\(f : A \\rightarrow B\\), obvious.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor hypothetical reasoning and intensional proof\ntheoretic semantics see Do\u0161en (2003; 2016) and\nSchroeder-Heister (2012c, 2016).\n3.7 Intensional proof-theoretic semantics\n\nAs mentioned in the first section\n (1.1),\n proof-theoretic semantics is intensional in spirit, as it is\ninterested in proofs and not just provability. For proof-theoretic\nsemantics it is not only relevant, whether \\(B\\) follows from \\(A\\),\nbut also, in which way we can establish that \\(B\\) follows from \\(A\\).\nIn other words, the identity of proofs is an important issue. However,\nthough this is prima facie obvious and proof-theoretic semanticists\nwould normally agree with this abstract claim, the practice in\nproof-theoretic semantics is often different, and the topic of the\nidentity of proofs is much neglected. It very frequently happens that\nrules which are equally powerful are identified. For example, when\nprinciples of harmony are discussed, and one considers the standard\nintroduction rule for conjunction \n\\[\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\AxiomC{$B$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$A\\land B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\\]\n\n\nmany proof-theoretic semanticists would consider it irrelevant whether\none chooses the pair of projections \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A \\land B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A\\land B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nor the pair \n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A \\land B$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A\\land B$}\n\\AxiomC{$A$}\n\\BinaryInfC{$B$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nas the elimination rules for conjunction. The second pair of rules\nwould often be considered to be just a more complicated variant of the\npair of projections. However, from an intensional point of view, these\ntwo pairs of rules are not identical. Identifying them corresponds to\nidentifying \\(A \\land B\\) and \\(A \\land (A \\rightarrow B)\\), which is\nonly extensionally, but not intensionally correct. As Do\u0161en has\nfrequently argued (e.g., Do\u0161en 1997; 2006), formulas such as\n\\(A \\land B\\) and \\(A \\land(A \\rightarrow B)\\) are equivalent, but not\nisomorphic. Here \u201cisomorphic\u201d means that when proving one\nformula from the other and vice versa, we obtain, by combining these\ntwo proofs, the identity proof. This is not the case in this\nexample.\n\nPursuing this idea leads to principles of harmony and inversion which\nare different from the the standard ones. As harmony and inversion lie\nat the heart of proof-theoretic semantics, many of its issues are\ntouched. Taking the topic of intensionality seriously means reshaping\nmany fields of proof-theoretic semantics (see Schroeder-Heister,\n2022). This has repercussions in various neighbouring fields such as\nthe treatment of paradoxes. The first monograph on intensional\nproof-theoretic semantics, with particular emphasis on the topic of\nparadoxes, has been written by Tranchini (2023).\n\nSince the identity of proofs is a basic topic of categorial proof\ntheory (see section\n 2.5),\n the latter will require more attention in proof-theoretic semantics\nthan is currently the case.\n3.8. Paradoxes\n\nThe logical, mathematical and semantical paradoxes, which play a\ncrucial role in logic and the philosophy of mathematics, receive a\nnovel rendering in the framework of proof-theoretic semantics. If one\nformulates paradoxes in the context of introduction and elimination\nrules, one can apply to them the proof-theoretic machinery of\nproof-reduction. Suppose introduction and elimination rules for set\nterms are given as follows (in a kind of naive set theory):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$A(t)$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$t \\in \\{x:A(x)\\}$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\hspace{1.5em}\n\n\\begin{prooftree}\n\\AxiomC{$t \\in \\{x:A(x)\\}$}\n\\UnaryInfC{$A(t)$}\n\\end{prooftree}\n\\]\n\n\nThen, for \\(r\\) as \\(\\{x: x \\not\\in x\\}\\), we can infer \\(r \\in r\\)\nfrom \\(r \\not\\in r\\) and vice versa, which is a natural deduction\nvariant of Russell\u2019s paradox. Now Prawitz (1965, Appendix B)\nobserved that the derivation of absurdity arising from Russell\u2019s\nparadox is non-normalizable, a feature that Tennant (1982) was able to\ndemonstrate for a vast range of paradoxes. From the standpoint of\nproof-theoretic semantics, a non-normalizable proof may well be\nconsidered invalid, at least not valid in the sense in which a\nnormalizable proof is valid. This means that we obtain a\nproof-theoretic criterion to tell whether we have a meaningful proof\nor not, and proofs of the paradoxes would not be meaningful in this\nsense. The Prawitz-Tennant analysis of paradoxes has opened up the\nfield of the proof-theory of paradoxes, which goes way beyond\nproof-theoretic semantics in the narrower sense. It is closely related\nto the aspect of intensionality (see section\n 3.7)\n and also to the idea of definitional reflection (see section\n 2.3.2\n and the\n Supplement on Definitional Reflection and Paradoxes).\n\nA particularly interesting paradox from the point of view of\nproof-theoretic semantics is Ekman\u2019s paradox. It results from\ncodifying an implicational variant of Russell\u2019s paradox in\nminimal propositional logic. It turns out that, depending on how\nreductions of detour derivations are formulated, certain derivations\nin minimal propositional logic are not normalizable. This sheds a\nstrong light on the concept of proof reduction, which is absolutely\nessential in natural-deduction style proof-theoretic semantics: much\ndepends on its careful definition. In fact, the concept of proof\nreduction constitutes the concept of proof identity and goes way\nbeyond the extensional idea that \u201cdetours\u201d in proofs are\nremoved.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor Russell\u2019s paradox in general see the entry on\n Russell\u2019s paradox.\n\nFor the treatment of paradoxes in proof-theoretic semantics,\nincluding Ekman\u2019s paradox see Tranchini (2023).\n3.9 Reduction, game theory and dialogues\n\nWhile deduction is forward-directed, passing from sentences already\nestablished to further sentences by means of justified rules,\nreduction proceeds backwards, trying to find an argument for a given\nclaim. It thus belongs to proof search. Various methods of proof\nsearch have been discovered and discussed in computer science:\nresolution and tableau systems are prominent examples. However, from a\nsemantical perspective, reductive approaches are not conceptually\nsecondary to deduction but are theories in their own right. One might\neven suggest that reductive methods are primary from the semantical\npoint of view, as the search for an argument, or the possible ways of\nsearching for it, constitute the meaning of a given claim. This idea\nhas been adopted, for example, in dialogical or game-theoretical\nsemantics, but can and should be incorporated in proof-theoretic\nsemantics in general. This is a major desideratum of proof-theoretic\nsemantics, which so far is predominantly based on deduction rather\nthan reduction.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor the idea of reductive logic and its semantics see the\nmonograph by David Pym and Eike Ritter (2004).\n\nFor dialogical logic see the entry on\n dialogical logic\n as well as Thomas Piecha\u2019s entry on\n dialogical logic\n the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.\n\nFor game-theoretical approaches in logic see the entry on\n logic and games.\n3.10 Substructural approaches\n\nAs soon as one treats proof-theoretic semantics in the framework of\nthe sequent calculus and thus focuses on hypothetical rather than\ncategorical claims, the area of logics with restricted structural\nrules, called \u201csubstructural logics\u201d, demands semantical\nconsideration. Here the way assumptions are introduced and kept in\none\u2019s discourse represents a much more fine-grained structure\nthan assumptions in natural deduction, where they are normally\nconsidered to be sets of statements. Due to the possibility of\nstructuring the succedent of a sequent in an analogous way,\nproof-theoretic semantics looses its intuitionistic bias without\nnecessarily becoming classical. Within the framework of substructural\nlogic, deviant logical systems such as relevant logic or\nresource-sensitive logics can easily be modelled. A particularly\ninteresting topic is the logic of bunched implications, which\ndistinguishes different, but co-existing ways of structuring\nassumptions and conclusions (see Pym, 2002). Substructural logic is\nwell-established as a general tool to describe logical\nsystems within a single emcompassing structural framework. Whether\nsubstructural logic eo ipso represents a semantical\nframework, is still an open question.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor substructural logic in general see the entry on\n substructural logics.\n4. Conclusion and outlook\n\nStandard proof-theoretic semantics has practically exclusively been\noccupied with logical constants. Logical constants play a central role\nin reasoning and inference, but are definitely not the exclusive, and\nperhaps not even the most typical sort of entities that can be defined\ninferentially. A framework is needed that deals with inferential\ndefinitions in a wider sense and covers both logical and extra-logical\ninferential definitions alike. The idea of definitional reflection\nwith respect to arbitrary definitional rules (see section\n 2.3.2)\n and also natural language applications (see secton\n 3.4)\n point in this direction, but farther reaching conceptions can be\nimagined. Furthermore, the concentration on harmony, inversion\nprinciples, definitional reflection and the like is somewhat\nmisleading, as it might suggest that proof-theoretic semantics\nconsists of only that. It should be emphasized that already when it\ncomes to arithmetic, stronger principles are needed in addition to\ninversion. However, in spite of these limitations, proof-theoretic\nsemantics has already gained very substantial achievements that can\ncompete with more widespread approaches to semantics.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nFor contributions on a variety of aspects of proof-theoretic semantics\nsee the reader edited by Piecha and Wehmeier (2023, open access).",
