    "main_text": "Life and Work\n1. Life and Work\n\n\nGeorge Boole was born November 2, 1815 in Lincoln, Lincolnshire,\nEngland, into a family of modest means, with a father who was\nevidently more of a good companion than a good breadwinner. His father\nwas a shoemaker whose real passion was being a devoted dilettante in\nthe realm of science and technology, one who enjoyed participating in\nthe Lincoln Mechanics\u2019 Institution; this was essentially a community\nsocial club promoting reading, discussions, and lectures regarding\nscience. It was founded in 1833, and in 1834 Boole\u2019s father became the\ncurator of its library. This love of learning was clearly inherited by\nBoole. Without the benefit of an elite schooling, but with a\nsupportive family and access to excellent books, in particular from\nSir Edward Bromhead, FRS, who lived only a few miles from Lincoln,\nBoole was able to essentially teach himself foreign languages and\nadvanced mathematics.\n\n\nStarting at the age of 16 it was necessary for Boole to find gainful\nemployment, since his father was no longer capable of providing for\nthe family. After 3 years working as a teacher in private schools,\nBoole decided, at the age of 19, to open his own small school in\nLincoln. He would be a schoolmaster for the next 15 years, until 1849\nwhen he became a professor at the newly opened Queen\u2019s University in\nCork, Ireland. With heavy responsibilities for his parents and\nsiblings, it is remarkable that he nonetheless found time during the\nyears as a schoolmaster to continue his own education and to start a\nprogram of research, primarily on differential equations and the\ncalculus of variations connected with the works of Laplace and\nLagrange (which he studied in the original French).\n\n\nThere is a widespread belief that Boole was primarily a\nlogician\u2014in reality he became a recognized mathematician well\nbefore he had penned a single word about logic, all the while running\nhis private school to care for his parents and siblings. Boole\u2019s\nability to read French, German and Italian put him in a good position\nto start serious mathematical studies when, at the age of 16, he read\nLacroix\u2019s Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel, a gift from his friend\nReverend G.S. Dickson of Lincoln. Seven years later, in 1838, he would\nwrite his first mathematical paper (although not the first to be\npublished), \u201cOn certain theorems in the calculus of\nvariations,\u201d focusing on improving results he had read in\nLagrange\u2019s M\u00e9chanique Analytique.\n\n\nIn early 1839 Boole travelled to Cambridge to meet with the young\nmathematician Duncan F. Gregory (1813\u20131844), the editor\nof the Cambridge Mathematical Journal\n(CMJ)\u2014Gregory had co-founded this journal in 1837 and\nedited it until his health failed in 1843 (he died in early 1844, at\nthe age of 30). Gregory, though only 2 years beyond his degree in\n1839, became an important mentor to Boole. With Gregory\u2019s support,\nwhich included coaching Boole on how to write a mathematical paper,\nBoole entered the public arena of mathematical publication in\n1841.\n\n\nBoole\u2019s mathematical publications span the 24 years from 1841 to 1864,\nthe year he died from pneumonia. Breaking these 24 years into three\nsegments, the first 6 years (1841\u20131846), the \nsecond 8 years (1847\u20131854), and the last 10 years \n(1855\u20131864), we find that his published work on \nlogic was entirely in the middle 8 years.\n\n\nIn his first 6 career years, Boole published 15 mathematical papers,\nall but two in the CMJ and its 1846 successor, The\nCambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal. He wrote on standard\nmathematical topics, mainly differential equations, integration and the\ncalculus of variations. Boole enjoyed early success in using the new\nsymbolical method in analysis, a method which took a differential\nequation, say:\n\n\\[\nd^2 y/dx^2 - dy/dx - 2y = \\cos(x),\n\\]\n\n\nand wrote it in the form Operator\\((y) =\\) cos\\((x)\\). \nThis was (formally) achieved by letting:\n\n\\[\nD = d/dx, D^2 = d^2 /dx^2, \\text{etc.}\n\\]\n\n\nleading to an expression of the differential equation as:\n\n\\[\n(D^2 - D - 2) y = \\cos(x).\n\\]\n\n\n\nNow symbolical algebra came into play by simply treating the operator\n\\(D^2 - D - 2\\) as though it were an ordinary polynomial in\nalgebra. Boole\u2019s 1841 paper On the integration of linear\ndifferential equations with constant coefficients gave a nice\nimprovement to Gregory\u2019s method for solving such differential\nequations, an improvement based on a standard tool in algebra, partial fractions, \nwhich he applied to the reciprocal of differential operators like the above.\n\n\nIn 1841 Boole also published his first paper on invariants, a paper\nthat would strongly influence Eisenstein, Cayley, and Sylvester to\ndevelop the subject. Arthur Cayley (1821\u20131895), the future\nSadlerian Professor in Cambridge and one of the most prolific\nmathematicians in history, wrote his first letter to Boole in 1844,\ncomplimenting him on his excellent work on invariants. He became a\nclose personal friend, one who would go to Lincoln to visit and stay\nwith Boole in the years before Boole moved to Cork, Ireland. In 1842\nBoole started a correspondence with Augustus De Morgan\n(1806\u20131871) that initiated another lifetime friendship.\n\n\nIn 1843 the schoolmaster Boole finished a lengthy paper on\ndifferential equations, combining an exponential substitution and\nvariation of parameters with the separation of symbols method. The\npaper was too long for the CMJ\u2014Gregory, and later De\nMorgan, encouraged him to submit it to the Royal Society. The first\nreferee rejected Boole\u2019s paper, but the second recommended it for the\nGold Medal for the best mathematical paper written in the years\n1841\u20131844, and this recommendation was accepted. In 1844 the\nRoyal Society published Boole\u2019s paper and awarded him the Gold \nMedal\u2014the first Gold Medal awarded by the Society to a mathematician.\nThe next year Boole read a paper at the annual meeting of the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science at Cambridge in June 1845.\nThis led to new contacts and friends, in particular William Thomson\n(1824\u20131907), the future Lord Kelvin.\n\n\nNot long after starting to publish papers, Boole was eager to\nfind a way to become affiliated with an institution of higher learning.\nHe considered attending Cambridge University to obtain a degree, but\nwas counselled that fulfilling the various requirements would likely\nseriously interfere with his research program, not to mention the\nproblems of obtaining financing. Finally, in 1849, he obtained a\nprofessorship in a new university opening in Cork, Ireland. In the\nyears he was a professor in Cork (1849\u20131864) he would\noccasionally inquire about the possibility of a position back in\nEngland.\n\n\nThe 8 year stretch from 1847 to 1854 starts and ends with Boole\u2019s\ntwo books on mathematical logic. In addition Boole published 24 more\npapers on traditional mathematics during this period, while only one\npaper was written on logic, that being in 1848. He was awarded an\nhonorary LL.D. degree by the University of Dublin in 1851, and this was\nthe title that he used beside his name in his 1854 book on logic.\n\n\nBoole\u2019s 1847 book, Mathematical Analysis of Logic, will be\nreferred to as MAL; the 1854 book, Laws of Thought,\nas LT.\n\n\nDuring the last 10 years of his career, from 1855 to 1864, Boole\npublished 17 papers on mathematics and two mathematics books, one on\ndifferential equations and one on difference equations. Both books were\nhighly regarded, and used for instruction at Cambridge. Also\nduring this time significant honors came in:\n\n\n1857\u00a0Fellowship of the Royal Society\n1858\u00a0Honorary Member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society\n1859\u00a0Degree of DCL, honoris causa from Oxford\n\n\nUnfortunately his keen sense of duty led to his walking through a\nrainstorm in late 1864, and then lecturing in wet clothes. Not long\nafterwards, on December 8, 1864 in Ballintemple, County Cork, Ireland,\nhe died of pneumonia, at the age of 49. Another paper on mathematics\nand a revised book on differential equations, giving considerable\nattention to singular solutions, were published post mortem.\n\n\nThe reader interested in excellent accounts of\nBoole\u2019s personal life is referred to Desmond MacHale\u2019s George\nBoole, His Life and Work, 1985/2014,\nand the more recent book \nNew Light on George Boole, 2018, by Desmond MacHale and Yvonne Cohen,\nsources to which this article is greatly\nindebted.\n\n1815 \u2014 Birth in Lincoln, England\n1830 \u2014 His translation of a Greek poem printed in a local paper\n1831 \u2014 Reads Lacroix\u2019s Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel\nSchoolmaster\n1834 \u2014 Opens his own school\n1835 \u2014 Gives public address on Newton\u2019s achievements\n1838 \u2014 Writes first mathematics paper\n1839 \u2014 Visits Cambridge to meet Duncan Gregory, editor of the\nCambridge Mathematical Journal (CMJ)\n1841 \u2014 First four mathematical publications (all in the\nCMJ)\n1842 \u2014 Initiates correspondence with Augustus De Morgan\n\u2014 they become lifelong friends\n1844 \u2014 Correspondence with Cayley starts (initiated by\nCayley) \u2014 they become lifelong friends\n1844 \u2014 Gold Medal from the Royal Society for a paper on\ndifferential equations\n1845 \u2014 Gives talk at the Annual Meeting of the British\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, and meets William Thomson\n(later Lord Kelvin) \u2014 they become lifelong friends\n1847 \u2014 Publishes Mathematical Analysis of Logic\n1848 \u2014 Publishes his only paper on the algebra of logic\nProfessor of Mathematics\n1849 \u2014 Accepts position as (the first) Professor of Mathematics at the new Queen\u2019s University in Cork, Ireland\n1851 \u2014 Honorary Degree, LL.D., from Trinity College, Dublin\n1854 \u2014 Publishes Laws of Thought \n1855 \u2014 Marriage to Mary Everest, niece of George Everest,\nSurveyor-General of India after whom Mt.
