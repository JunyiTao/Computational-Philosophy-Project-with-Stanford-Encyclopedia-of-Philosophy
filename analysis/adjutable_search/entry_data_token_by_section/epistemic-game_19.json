    "main_text": "Developments || Nash Equilibrium\n5.1 Nash Equilibrium\n5.1.1 The Result\nIterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies is a very\nintuitive concept, but for many games it does not tell anything about\nwhat the players will or should choose. In coordination games\n(Figure 1 above) for instance, all\nprofiles, can be played under rationality and common belief of\nrationality.\nLooking again at Figure 1, one can\nask what would happen if Bob knew (that is had correct\nbeliefs about) Ann\u2019s strategy choice? Intuitively, it is quite\nclear that his rational choice is to coordinate with her. If\nhe knows that she plays \\(t\\), for instance, then playing \\(l\\)\nis clearly the only rational choice for him, and similarly, if he\nknows that she plays \\(b\\), then \\(r\\) is the only rational choice. The\nsituation is symmetric for Ann. For instance, if she knows that Bob\nplays \\(l\\), then her only rational choice is to choose \\(t\\). More\nformally, the only states where Ann is rational and her\ntype knows (i.e., is correct and assigns probability 1 to)\nBob\u2019s strategy choice and where Bob is also rational and his\ntype knows Ann\u2019s strategy choices are states where they\nplay either \\((t,l)\\) or \\((b,r)\\), the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of\nthe game.\nA Nash equilibrium is a profile where no player has an\nincentive to unilaterally deviate from his strategy choice. In other\nwords, a Nash equilibrium is a combination of (possibly mixed)\nstrategies such that they all play their best response given the\nstrategy choices of the others. Again, \\((t,l)\\) and \\((b,r)\\) are the\nonly pure-strategy equilibria of the above coordination game. Nash\nequilibrium, and its numerous refinements, is arguably the game\ntheoretical solution concept that has been most used in game theory\n(Aumann & Hart 1994) and philosophy (e.g., famously in Lewis\n1969).\nThe seminal result of Aumann & Brandenburger 1995 provides an\nepistemic characterization of the Nash equilibrium in terms\nof mutual knowledge of strategy choices (and the structure of\nthe game). See, also, Spohn (1982) for an early statement. Before\nstating the theorem, we discuss an example from Aumann &\nBrandenburger (1995) that illustrates the key ideas. Consider the\nfollowing coordination game:\n\n\n \u00a0 B \nA \n\nl r\nu 2,2  0,0 \nd 0,0  1,1 \n\n\n\nFigure 20\n\nThe two pure-strategy Nash equilibria are \\((u,l)\\) and \\((d,r)\\)\n(there is also a mixed-strategy equilibrium). As usual, we fix an\ninformational context for this game. Let \\(\\T\\) be a type space for the\ngame with three types for each player \\(T_A=\\{a_1,a_2, a_3\\}\\) and\n\\(T_B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}\\) with the following type functions:\n\n\n\n\nl r\n\\(b_1\\) 0.5  0.5 \n\\(b_2\\) 0  0 \n\\(b_3\\) 0  0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(b_1\\) 0.5  0 \n\\(b_2\\) 0  0 \n\\(b_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(b_1\\) 0  0 \n\\(b_2\\) 0  0.5 \n\\(b_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda_A(a_1)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_A(a_2)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_A(a_3)\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nl r\n\\(a_1\\) 0.5  0 \n\\(a_2\\) 0  0.5 \n\\(a_3\\) 0  0 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(a_1\\) 0.5  0 \n\\(a_2\\) 0  0 \n\\(a_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nl r\n\\(a_1\\) 0  0 \n\\(a_2\\) 0  0.5 \n\\(a_3\\) 0  0.5 \n\n\n\n\\(\\lambda_B(b_1)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_B(b_2)\\)\n\\(\\lambda_B(b_3)\\)\n\n\nFigure 21\n\nConsider the state \\((d,r,a_3,b_3)\\). Both \\(a_3\\) and \\(b_3\\) correctly\nbelieve (i.e., assign probability 1 to) that the outcome is \\((d,r)\\)\n(we have \\(\\lambda_A(a_3)(r)=\\lambda_B(b_3)(d)=1\\)). This fact is not\ncommon knowledge: \\(a_3\\) assigns a 0.5 probability to Bob being of type\n\\(b_2\\), and type \\(b_2\\) assigns a 0.5 probability to Ann playing\n\\(l\\). Thus, Ann does not know that Bob knows that she is playing \\(r\\)\n(here, \u201cknowledge\u201d is identified with \u201cprobability\n1\u201d as it is in Aumann & Brandenburger 1995). Furthermore,\nwhile it is true that both Ann and Bob are rational, it is not common\nknowledge that they are rational. Indeed, the type \\(a_3\\) assigns a 0.5\nprobability to Bob being of type \\(b_2\\) and choosing \\(r\\); however, this\nis irrational since \\(b_2\\) believes that both of Ann\u2019s options\nare equally probable.\nThe example above is a situation where there is mutual knowledge of\nthe choices of the players. Indeed, it is not hard to see that in any\ntype space for a 2-player game \\(G\\), if \\((s,t)\\) is a state where there\nis mutual knowledge that player \\(i\\) is choosing \\(s_i\\) and the players\nare rational, then, \\(s\\) constitutes a (pure-strategy) Nash\nEquilibrium. There is a more general theorem concerning mixed strategy\nequilibrium. Recall that a conjecture for player \\(i\\) is a probability\nmeasure over the strategy choices of her opponents.\n\nTheorem 5.1  (Aumann & Brandenburger 1995: Theorem A)\nSuppose that \\(G\\) is a 2-person strategic game, \\((p_1,p_2)\\) are\nconjectures for players 1 and 2, and \\(\\T\\) is a type space for \\(G\\). If\n\\((s,t)\\) is a state in \\(\\T\\) where for \\(i=1,2\\), \\(t_i\\) assigns\nprobability 1 to the events (a) both players are rational (i.e.,\nmaximize expected utility), (b) the game is \\(G\\) and (c) for \\(i=1,2\\),\nplayer \\(i\\)\u2019s conjecture is \\(p_i\\), then \\((p_1, p_2)\\) constitutes\na Nash equilibrium.\n\nThe general version of this result, for arbitrary finite number of\nagents and allowing for mixed strategies, requires common\nknowledge of conjectures, i.e., of each player\u2019s\nprobabilistic beliefs in the other\u2019s choices. See Aumann &\nBrandenburger (1995: Theorem B) for precise formulation of the result,\nand, again, Spohn (1982) for an early version. See, also, Perea (2007)\nand Tan & Werlang (1988) for similar results about the Nash\nequilibrium.\n5.1.2 Philosophical Issues\nThis epistemic characterization of Nash equilibrium requires\nmutual knowledge and rather than beliefs. The result fails\nwhen agents can be mistaken about the strategy choice of the\nothers. This has lead some authors to criticize this epistemic\ncharacterization: See Gintis (2009) and Bruin (2010), for\ninstance. How could the players ever know what the others are\nchoosing? Is it not contrary to the very idea of a game, where the\nplayers are free to choose whatever they want (Baltag et\nal. 2009)?\nOne popular response to this criticism (Brandenburger 2010; Perea\n2012) is that the above result tells us something about Nash\nequilibrium as a solution concept, namely that it\nalleviates strategic uncertainty. Indeed, returning to the\nterminology introduced in Section 1.3, the\nepistemic conditions for Nash equilibrium are those that correspond to\nthe ex post state of information disclosure, \u201cwhen all\nis said and done\u201d, to put it figuratively. When players have\nreached full knowledge of what the others are going to do, there is\nnothing left to think about regarding the other players as rational,\ndeliberating agents. The consequences of each of the players\u2019\nactions are now certain. The only task that remains is to compute\nwhich action is recommended by the adopted choice rule, and this does\nnot involve any specific information about the other players\u2019\nbeliefs. Their choices are fixed, after all.\nThe idea here is not to reject the epistemic characterization of\nNash Equilibrium on the grounds that it rests on unrealistic\nassumptions, but, rather, to view it as a lesson learned about Nash\nEquilibrium itself. From an epistemic point of view, where one is\nfocused on strategic reasoning about what others are going to\ndo and are thinking, this solution concepts might be of less\ninterest.\nThere is another important lesson to draw from this epistemic\ncharacterization result. The widespread idea that game theory\n\u201cassumes common knowledge of rationality\u201d, perhaps in\nconjunction with the extensive use of equilibrium concepts in\ngame-theoretic analysis, has lead to misconception that the Nash\nEquilibrium either requires common knowledge of rationality,\nor that common knowledge of rationality is sufficient for the players\nto play according to a Nash equilibrium. To be sure, game theoretic\nmodels do assume that the structure of the game is common knowledge\n(though, see Section 5.3). Nonetheless, the\nabove result shows that both of these ideas are incorrect:\n\n\nCommon knowledge of rationality is neither necessary nor sufficient\nfor Nash Equilibrium.\n\nIn fact, as we just stressed, Nash equilibrium can be played under\nfull uncertainty, and a fortiori under higher-order\nuncertainty, about the rationality of others.\n5.1.3 Remarks on \u201cModal\u201d Characterizations of Nash Equilibrium\nIn recent years, a number of so-called \u201cmodal\u201d\ncharacterizations of Nash Equilibrium have been proposed, mostly using\ntechniques from modal logic (see Hoek & Pauly 2007 for\ndetails). These results typically devise a modal logical language to\ndescribe games in strategic form, typically including modalities for\nthe players\u2019 actions and preference, and show that the notion of\nprofile being a Nash Equilibrium language is definable in\nsuch a language.\nMost of these characterizations are not epistemic, and thus fall\noutside the scope of this entry. In context of this entry, it is\nimportant to note that most of these results aim at something\ndifferent than the epistemic characterization which we are discussing\nin this section. Mostly developed in Computer Sciences, these logical\nlanguages have been used to verify properties of multi-agents systems,\nnot to provide epistemic foundations to this solution\nconcept. However, note that in recent years, a number of logical\ncharacterizations of Nash equilibrium do explicitly use epistemic\nconcepts (see, for example, van Benthem et al. 2009; Lorini &\nSchwarzentruber 2010).\n5.2 Incorporating Admissibility and \u201cCautious\u201d Beliefs\nIt is not hard to find a game and an informational context where\nthere is at least one player without a unique \u201crational\nchoice\u201d. How should a rational player incorporate the\ninformation that more than one action is classified as\n\u201cchoice-worthy\u201d or \u201crationally permissible\u201d\n(according to some choice rule) for her opponent(s)? In such a\nsituation, it is natural to require that the player does not rule\nout the possibility that her opponent will pick a\n\u201cchoice-worthy\u201d option. More generally, the players should\nbe \u201ccautious\u201d about which of their opponents\u2019\noptions they rule out.\nAssuming that the players\u2019 beliefs are \u201ccautious\u201d\nis naturally related to weak dominance (recall the characterization of\nweak dominance, Section 3.2\nin which a strategy is weakly dominated iff it does not maximize\nexpected utility with respect to any full support probability\nmeasure). A key issue in epistemic game theory is the epistemic\nanalysis of iterated removal of weakly dominated strategies. Many\nauthors have pointed out puzzles surrounding such an analysis (Asheim\n& Dufwenberg 2003; Brandenburger, Friedenberg & Keisler 2008;\nCubitt & Sugden 1994; Samuelson 1992). For example, Samuelson\n(1992) showed (among other things) that the analogue of Theorem 4.1 is\nnot true for iterated removal of weakly dominated strategies. The main\nproblem is illustrated by the following game:\n\n\n \u00a0 Bob \nAnn \n\nl r\nu 1,1  1,0 \nd 1,0  0,1 \n\n\n\nFigure 22\n\nIn the above game, \\(d\\) is weakly dominated by \\(u\\) for Ann. If Bob\nknows that Ann is rational (in the sense that she will not choose a\nweakly dominated strategy), then he can rule out option \\(d\\). In the\nsmaller game, action \\(r\\) is now strictly dominated by \\(l\\) for Bob. If\nAnn knows that Bob is rational and that Bob knows that she is rational\n(and so, rules out option \\(d\\)), then she can rule out option\n\\(r\\). Assuming that the above reasoning is transparent to both Ann and\nBob, it is common knowledge that Ann will play \\(u\\) and Bob will play\n\\(l\\). But now, what is the reason for Bob to rule out the possibility\nthat Ann will play \\(d\\)? He knows that Ann knows that he is going to\nplay \\(l\\) and both \\(u\\) and \\(d\\) are best responses to \\(l\\). The problem\nis that assuming that the players\u2019 beliefs are cautious\nconflicts with the logic of iterated removal of weakly dominated\nstrategies. This issue is nicely described in a well-known microeconomics\ntextbook:\n\n[T]he argument for deletion of a weakly dominated strategy for\nplayer \\(i\\) is that he contemplates the possibility that every strategy\ncombination of his rivals occurs with positive probability. However,\nthis hypothesis clashes with the logic of iterated deletion, which\nassumes, precisely that eliminated strategies are not expected to\noccur. (Mas-Colell, Winston, & Green 1995: 240)\n\nThe extent of this conflict is nicely illustrated in Samuelson\n(1992). In particular, Samuelson (1992) shows that there is no\nepistemic-probability \nmodel[14]\n of the above game with\na state satisfying common knowledge of rationality (where\n\u201crationality\u201d means that players do not choose weakly\ndominated strategies). Prima facie, this is puzzling: What\nabout the epistemic-probability model consisting of a single state \\(w\\)\nassigned the profile \\((u, l)\\)? Isn\u2019t this a model of the above\ngame where there is a state satisfying common knowledge that the\nplayers do not choose weakly dominated strategies? The problem is that\nthe players do not have \u201ccautious\u201d beliefs in this model\n(in particular, Bob\u2019s beliefs are not cautious in the sense\ndescribed below). Recall that having a cautious belief means that a\nplayer cannot know which options her opponent(s)\nwill \npick[15]\n from a set of choice-worthy options (in the\nabove game, if Ann knows that Bob is choosing \\(l\\), then both\n\\(u\\) and \\(d\\) are \u201cchoice-worthy\u201d, so Bob\ncannot know that Ann is choosing \\(u\\)). This suggests an\nadditional requirement on a game model: Let \\(\\M=\\epprobmodel\\) be an\nepistemic-probability model. For each action \\(a\\in \\cup_{i\\in\\Agt}\nS_i\\), let \\({[\\![{a}]\\!]}=\\{w \\mid (\\sigma(w))_i=a\\}\\).\nIf \\(a\\in S_i\\) is rational for player \\(i\\) at state\n\\(w\\), then for all players \\(j\\ne i\\), \\({[\\![{a}]\\!]}\\cap \\Pi_j(w)\\ne\n\\emptyset\\).\nThis means that a player cannot know that her opponent\nwill not choose an action at a state \\(w\\) which is deemed rational\n(according to some choice rule). This property is called\n\u201cprivacy of tie-breaking\u201d by Cubitt and Sugden (2011: 8)\nand \u201cno extraneous beliefs\u201d by Asheim and Dufwenberg\n(2003).[16]\n For an extended discussion of the above\nassumption see Cubitt & Sugden (2011).\nGiven the above considerations, the epistemic analysis of iterated\nweak dominance is not a straightforward adaptation of the analysis of\niterated strict dominance discussed in the previous section. In\nparticular, any such analysis must resolve the conflict between\nstrategic reasoning where players rule out certain strategy\nchoices of their opponent(s) and admissibility considerations where\nplayers must consider all of their opponents\u2019\noptions possible. A number of authors have developed\nframeworks that do resolve this conflict (Brandenburger et al. 2008;\nAsheim & Dufwenberg 2003; Halpern & Pass 2009). We sketch one\nof these solutions below:\nThe key idea is to represent the players\u2019 beliefs as\na lexicographic probability system (LPS). An LPS is a finite\nsequence of probability measures \\((p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n)\\) with supports\n(The support of a probability measure \\(p\\) defined on\na set of states \\(W\\) is the set of all states that have nonzero\nprobability; formally, \\(Supp(p)=\\{w \\mid p(w)>0\\}\\)) that do not\noverlap. This is interpreted as follows: if \\((p_1,\\ldots,p_n)\\)\nrepresents Ann\u2019s beliefs, then \\(p_1\\) is Ann\u2019s\n\u201cinitial hypothesis\u201d about what Bob is going to do, \\(p_2\\)\nis Ann\u2019s secondary hypothesis, and so on. In the above game, we\ncan describe Bob\u2019s beliefs as follows: his initial hypothesis\nis that Ann will choose \\(U\\) with probability 1 and his secondary\nhypothesis is that she will choose \\(D\\) with probability 1. The\ninterpretation is that, although Bob does not rule out the possibility\nthat Ann will choose \\(D\\) (i.e., choose irrationally), he does consider\nit infinitely less likely than her choosing \\(U\\) (i.e.,\nchoosing rationally).\nSo, representing beliefs as lexicographic probability measures\nresolves the conflict between strategic reasoning and the assumption\nthat players do not play weakly dominated strategies. However, there\nis another, more fundamental, issue that arises in the epistemic\nanalysis of iterated weak dominance:\n\nUnder admissibility, Ann considers everything possible. But this is\nonly a decision-theoretic statement. Ann is in a game, so we imagine\nshe asks herself: \u201cWhat about Bob? What does he consider\npossible?\u201d If Ann truly considers everything possible, then it\nseems she should, in particular, allow for the possibility that Bob\ndoes not! Alternatively put, it seems that a full analysis of the\nadmissibility requirement should include the idea that other players\ndo not conform to the requirement.  (Brandenburger et al. 2008:\n313)\n\nThere are two main ingredients to the epistemic characterization of\niterated weak dominance. The first is to represent the players\u2019\nbeliefs as lexicographic probability systems. The second is to use a\nstronger notion of belief: A player assumes an event\n\\(E\\) provided \\(E\\) is infinitely more likely than \\(\\overline{E}\\) (on\nfinite spaces, this means each state in \\(E\\) is infinitely more likely\nthan states not in \\(E\\)). The key question is: What is the precise\nrelationship between the event \u201crationality and common\nassumption of rationality\u201d and the strategies that survive\niterated removal of weakly dominated strategies? The precise answer\nturns out to be surprisingly subtle\u2014the details are beyond the\nscope of this article (see Brandenburger et al. 2008).\n5.3 Incorporating Unawareness\nThe game models introduced in Section 2 have\nbeen used to describe the uncertainty that the players have about what\ntheir opponents are going to do and are thinking in a game\nsituation. In the analyses provided thus far, the structure\nof the game (i.e., who is playing, what are the preferences of the\ndifferent players, and which actions are available) is assumed to be\ncommon knowledge among the players. However, there are many situations\nwhere the players do not have such complete information about\nthe game. There is no inherent difficulty in using the models\nfrom Section 2 to describe situations where\nplayers are not perfectly informed about the structure of the\ngame (for example, where there is some uncertainty about available\nactions).\nThere is, however, a foundational issue that arises here. Suppose\nthat Ann considers it impossible that her opponent will\nchoose action \\(a\\). Now, there are many reasons why Ann would hold such\nan opinion. On the one hand, Ann may know something about what her\nopponent is going to do or is thinking which allows her to rule out\naction \\(a\\) as a live possibility\u2014i.e., given all the evidence\nAnn has about her opponent, she concludes that action \\(a\\) is just not\nsomething her opponent will do. On the other hand, Ann may not even\nconceive of the possibility that her opponent will choose action\n\\(a\\). She may have a completely different model of the game in mind\nthan her opponents. The foundational question is: Can the game models\nintroduced in Section 2 faithfully represent\nthis latter type of uncertainty?\nThe question is not whether one can formally describe what Ann\nknows and believes under the assumption that she considers it\nimpossible that her opponent will choose action \\(a\\). Indeed, an\nepistemic-probability model where Ann assigns probability zero to the\nevent that her opponent chooses action \\(a\\) is a perfectly good\ndescription of Ann\u2019s epistemic state. The problem is that this\nmodel blurs an important distinction between Ann\nbeing unaware that action \\(a\\) is a live possibility and\nAnn ruling out that action \\(a\\) is a viable option for her\nopponent. This distinction is illustrated by the following snippet\nfrom the well-known Sherlock Holmes\u2019 short story Silver Blaze\n(Doyle 1894):\n\n\u2026I saw by the inspector\u2019s face that his attention had\nbeen keenly aroused.  \u201cYou consider that to be\nimportant?\u201d he [Inspector Gregory] asked.\n\u201cExceedingly so.\u201d \u201cIs there any point to which\nyou would wish to draw my attention?\u201d \u201cTo the\ncurious incident of the dog in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThe\ndog did nothing in the night-time.\u201d \u201cThat was the\ncurious incident,\u201d remarked Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThe point is that Holmes is aware of a particular event (\u201cthe\ndog not barking\u201d) and uses this to come to a conclusion. The\ninspector is not aware of this event, and so cannot (without\nHolmes\u2019 help) come to the same conclusion. This is true of many\ndetective stories: clever detectives not only have the ability to\n\u201cconnect the dots\u201d, but they are also aware of\nwhich dots need to be connected. Can we describe the inspector\u2019s\nunawareness in an epistemic \nmodel?[17]\nSuppose that \\(U_i(E)\\) is the event that the player \\(i\\) is unaware\nof the event \\(E\\). Of course, if \\(i\\) is unaware of \\(E\\) then \\(i\\) does\nnot know that \\(E\\) is true (\\(U_i(E)\\subseteq\n\\overline{K_i(E)}\\), where \\(\\overline{X}\\) denotes the complement\nof the event \\(X\\)). Recall that in epistemic models (where the\nplayers\u2019 information is described by partitions), we have the\nnegative introspection property:\n\n\\[\\overline{K_i(E)}\\subseteq K_i(\\overline{K_i(E)}).\\] \n\nThis means that if \\(i\\) is unaware of \\(E\\),\nthen \\(i\\) knows that she does not know that \\(E\\). Thus, to capture a\nmore natural definition of \\(U_i(E)\\) where \n\n\\[U_i(E) \\subseteq \\overline{K_i(E)} \\cap \\overline{K_i(\\overline{K_i(E)})},\\] \n\nwe need to\nrepresent the players\u2019 knowledge in a possibility\nstructure where the \\(K_i\\) operators do not necessarily satisfy\nnegative introspection. A possibility structure is a tuple \\(\\langle W,\n\\{P_i\\}_{i\\in\\A}, \\sigma\\rangle\\) where \\(P_i:W\\rightarrow \\pow(W)\\). The\nonly difference with an epistemic model is that the \\(P_i(w)\\) do not\nnecessarily form a partition of \\(W\\). We do not go into details\nhere\u2014see Halpern (1999) for a complete discussion of possibility\nstructures and how they relate to epistemic models. The knowledge\noperator is defined as it is for epistemic models: for each event \\(E\\),\n\\(K_i(E)=\\{w \\mid P_i(w)\\subseteq E\\}\\). However, S. Modica and\nA. Rustichini (1994, 1999) argue that even the more general\npossibility structures cannot be used to describe a player\u2019s\nunawareness.\nA natural definition of unawareness on possibility structures is:\n\n\\[U(E) = \\overline{K(E)} \\cap \\overline{K(\\overline{K(E)})} \\cap\n\\overline{K(\\overline{K(\\overline{K(E)})}}\\cap \\cdots\n\\]\n\nThat is, an agent is unaware of \\(E\\) provided the agent does not\nknow that \\(E\\) obtains, does not know that she does not know that \\(E\\)\nobtains, and so on. Modica and Rustichini use a variant of the above\nSherlock Holmes story to show that there is a problem with this\ndefinition of unawareness.\nSuppose there are two signals: A dog barking (\\(d\\)) and a cat\nhowling (\\(c\\)). Furthermore, suppose there are three states \\(w_1\\),\n\\(w_2\\) in which the dog barks and \\(w_3\\) in which the cat howls. The\nevent that there is no intruder is \\(E=\\{w_1\\}\\) (the lack of the two\nsignals indicates that there was no\nintruder[18]).\n The following possibility structure\n(where there is an arrow from state \\(w\\) to state \\(v\\) provided \\(v\\in\nP(w)\\)) describes the inspector\u2019s epistemic state:\n\n\nFigure 23\n\nConsider the following calculations:\n\n\\(K(E)=\\{w_2\\}\\) (at \\(w_2\\), Watson knows there is a human intruder)\nand \\(-K(E)=\\{w_1,w_3\\}\\)\n\\(K(-K(E))=\\{w_3\\}\\) (at \\(w_3\\), Watson knows that she does not know\n\\(E\\)), and \\(-K(-K(E))=\\{w_1,w_2\\}\\).\n\\(-K(E)\\cap -K(-K(E))=\\{w_1\\}\\) and, in fact, \\(\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty\n(-K)^i(E)=\\{w_1\\}\\)\nLet \\(U(F)=\\bigcap_{i=1}^\\infty (-K)^i(F)\\). Then,\n\n\\(U(\\emptyset)=U(W)=U(\\{w_1\\})=U(\\{w_2,w_3\\})=\\emptyset\\)\n\\(U(E)=U(\\{w_3\\})=U(\\{w_1,w_3\\})=U(\\{w_1,w_2\\}=\\{w_1\\}\\)\n\n\nSo, \\(U(E)=\\{w_1\\}\\) and \\(U(U(E))=U(\\{w_1\\})=\\emptyset\\). This means\nthat at state \\(w_1\\), the Inspector is unaware of \\(E\\), but is not\nunaware that he is unaware of \\(E\\). More generally, Dekel et al. (1998)\nshow that there is no nontrivial unawareness operator \\(U\\) satisfying\nthe following properties:\n\n\\(U(E) \\subseteq \\overline{K(E)}\\cap \\overline{K(E)}\\)\n\\(K(U(E))=\\emptyset\\)\n\\(U(E)\\subseteq U(U(E))\\)\n\nThere is an extensive literature devoted to developing models that\ncan represent the players\u2019 unawareness.

A Paradox of Self-Reference in Game Models\nThe first step in any epistemic analysis of a game is to describe\nthe players\u2019 knowledge and beliefs using (a possible variant of)\none of the models introduced in Section 2. As we\nnoted already in Section 2.2, there will be\nstatements about what the players know and believe about the game\nsituation and about each other that are commonly known in some models\nbut not in others.\n\nIn any particular structure, certain beliefs, beliefs about belief,\n\u2026, will be present and others won\u2019t be. So, there is an\nimportant implicit assumption behind the choice of a structure. This\nis that it is \u201ctransparent\u201d to the players that the\nbeliefs in the type structure\u2014and only those beliefs\u2014are\npossible \u2026.The idea is that there is a \u201ccontext\u201d to\nthe strategic situation (e.g., history, conventions, etc.) and this\n\u201ccontext\u201d causes the players to rule out certain\nbeliefs. (Brandenburger & Friedenberg 2010: 801)\n\nRuling out certain configurations of beliefs\nconstitute substantive assumptions about the players\u2019\nreasoning during the decision making process. In other words,\nsubstantive assumptions are about how, and how much, information is\nimparted to the agents, over and above those that are intrinsic to the\nmathematical formulation of the structures used to describe the\nplayers\u2019 information. It is not hard to see that one always\nfinds substantive assumptions in finite structures: Given a countably\ninfinite set of atomic propositions, for instance, in finite\nstructures it will always be common knowledge that some logically\nconsistent combination of these basic facts are not realized,\nand a fortiori for logically consistent configurations of\ninformation and higher-order information about these basic facts. On\nthe other hand, monotonicity of the belief/knowledge operator is a\ntypical example of an assumption that is not\nsubstantive. More generally, there are no models of games, as we\ndefined in Section 2, where it is not common\nknowledge that the players believe all the logical consequences of\ntheir beliefs.[19]\nCan we compare models in terms of the number of substantive\nassumptions that are made? Are there models that make no, or at least\nas few as possible, substantive assumptions? These questions have been\nextensively discussed in the epistemic foundations of game\ntheory\u2014see the discussion in Samuelson (1992) and the references\nin Moscati (2009). Intuitively, a structure without any substantive\nassumptions must represent all possible states of (higher-order)\ninformation. Whether such a structure exists will depend, in part, on\nhow the players\u2019 informational attitudes are\nrepresented\u2014e.g., as (conditional/lexicographic) probability\nmeasures or set-valued knowledge/belief functions. These questions\nhave triggered interest in the existence of \u201crich\u201d models\ncontaining most, if not all, possible configurations of (higher-order)\nknowledge and beliefs.\nThere are different ways to understand what it means for a\nstructure to minimize the substantive assumptions about the\nplayers\u2019 higher-order information. We do not attempt a complete\noverview of this interesting literature here (see Brandenburger &\nKeisler (2006: sec. 11) and Siniscalchi (2008: sec. 3) for discussion\nand pointers to the relevant results). One approach considers the\nspace of all (Harsanyi type-/Kripke-/epistemic-plausibility-)\nstructures and tries to find a single structure that, in some suitable\nsense, \u201ccontains\u201d all other structures. Such a structure,\noften called called a universal structure (or a terminal\nobject in the language of category theory), if it exists,\nincorporates any substantive assumption that an analyst can\nimagine. Such structure have been shown to exists for Harsanyi type\nspaces (Mertens & Zamir 1985; Brandenburger & Dekel 1993). For\nKripke structures, the question has been answered in the negative\n(Heifetz & Samet 1998; Fagin, Geanakoplos, Halpern, & Vardi\n1999; Meier 2005), with some qualifications regarding the language\nthat is used to describe them (Heifetz 1999; Roy & Pacuit\n2013).\nA second approach takes an internal perspective by asking\nwhether, for a fixed set of states or types, the agents are\nmaking any substantive assumptions about what their opponents know or\nbelieve. The idea is to identify (in a given model) a set of\npossible conjectures about the players. For example, in a\nknowledge structure based on a set of states \\(W\\) this might be the set\nof all subsets of \\(W\\) or the set definable subsets of \\(W\\) in some\nsuitable logical language. A space is said to be complete if\neach agent correctly takes into account each possible conjecture about\nher opponents. A simple counting argument shows that there cannot\nexist a complete structure when the set of conjectures is all\nsubsets of the set of states (Brandenburger 2003). However, there is a\ndeeper result here which we discuss below.\nThe Brandenburger-Keisler Paradox\nAdam Brandenburger and H. Jerome Keisler (2006) introduce the\nfollowing two person, Russel-style paradox. The statement of the\nparadox involves two concepts: beliefs and\nassumptions. An assumption is a player\u2019s strongest\nbelief: it is a set of states that implies all other beliefs at a\ngiven state. We will say more about the interpretation of an\nassumption below. Suppose there are two players, Ann and Bob, and\nconsider the following description of beliefs.\n\n(S)\nAnn believes that Bob assumes that Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong.\n\n\nA paradox arises by asking the question\n\n(Q)\nDoes Ann believe that Bob\u2019s assumption is wrong?\n\nTo ease the discussion, let \\(C\\) be Bob\u2019s assumption in (S):\nthat is, \\(C\\) is the statement \u201cAnn believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is wrong.\u201d So, (Q) asks whether \\(C\\) is true or\nfalse. We will argue that \\(C\\) is true if, and only if, \\(C\\) is\nfalse.\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is true. Then, Ann does believe that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is wrong, and, by introspection, she believes that she\nbelieves this. That is to say, Ann believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect. Furthermore, according to (S), Ann believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is \\(C\\). So, Ann, in fact, believes that Bob\u2019s\nassumption is correct (she believes Bob\u2019s assumption is \\(C\\) and\nthat \\(C\\) is correct). So, \\(C\\) is false.\nSuppose that \\(C\\) is false. This means that Ann believes that\nBob\u2019s assumption is correct. That is, Ann believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect (By (S), Ann believes that Bob\u2019s assumption is\n\\(C\\)). Furthermore, by (S), we have that Ann believes that Bob\nassumes that Ann believes that \\(C\\) is wrong. So, Ann believes\nthat she believes that \\(C\\) is correct and she believes that Bob\nassumption is that she believes that \\(C\\) is wrong. So, it is true that\nshe believes Bob\u2019s assumptions is wrong (Ann believes that\nBob\u2019s assumption is she believes that \\(C\\) is wrong, but\nshe believes that is wrong: she believes that \\(C\\) is\ncorrect). So, \\(C\\) is true.\nBrandenburger and Keisler formalize the above argument in order to\nprove a very strong impossibility result about the existence of\nso-called assumption-complete structures. We need some\nnotation to state this result. It will be most convenient to work in\nqualitative type spaces for two players\n(Definition 2.7). A qualitative type space\nfor two players (cf. Definition 2.7. The set\nof states is not important in what follows, so we leave it out) is a\nstructure \\(\\langle \\{T_A, T_B\\}, \\{\\lambda_A, \\lambda_B\\}\\rangle\\)\nwhere\n\n\\[\\lambda_A:T_A\\rightarrow \\pow(T_B)\\qquad\\lambda_B:T_B\\rightarrow\\pow(T_A)\\]\n\nA set of conjectures about Ann is a subset\n\\(\\C_A\\subseteq \\pow(T_A)\\) (similarly, the set of conjectures about Bob\nis a subset \\(\\C_B\\subseteq \\pow(T_B)\\)). A structure \\(\\langle \\{T_A,\nT_B\\}, \\{\\lambda_A, \\lambda_B\\}\\rangle\\) is said to\nbe assumption-complete for the conjectures \\(\\C_A\\) and\n\\(\\C_B\\) provided for each conjecture in \\(\\C_A\\) there is a type that\nassumes that conjecture (similarly for Bob). Formally, for each\n\\(Y\\in\\C_B\\) there is a \\(t_0\\in T_A\\) such that \\(\\lambda_A(t_0)=Y\\), and\nsimilarly for Bob. As we remarked above, a simple counting argument\nshows that when \\(\\C_A=\\pow(T_A)\\) and \\(\\C_B=\\pow(T_B)\\), then\nassumption-complete models only exist in trivial cases. A much deeper\nresult is:\n\nTheorem 6.1 (Brandenburger & Keisler 2006: Theorem 5.4)\nThere is no assumption-complete type structure for the set of\nconjectures that contains the first-order definable subsets.\n\nSee the supplement for a discussion of the proof of this theorem\n(see Section 2).\nConsult Pacuit (2007) and  Abramsky & Zvesper (2010) for an extensive analysis and\ngeneralization of this result. But, it is not all bad news: Mariotti,\nMeier, & Piccione (2005) construct a complete structure where the\nset of conjectures are compact subsets of some well-behaved\ntopological space.\n7. Concluding Remarks\nThe epistemic view on games is that players should be seen as\nindividual decision makers, choosing what to do on the basis of their\nown preferences and the information they have in specific\ninformational contexts. What decision they will make\u2014the\ndescriptive question\u2014or what decision they should make\u2014the\nnormative question, depends on the decision-theoretic choice rule that\nthe player use, or should use, in a given context. We conclude with\ntwo general methodological issues about epistemic game theory and some\npointers to further reading.\n7.1 What is an epistemic game theory trying to accomplish?\nCommon knowledge of rationality is an informal assumption that game\ntheorists, philosophers and other social scientists often appeal to\nwhen analyzing social interactive situations. The epistemic program in\ngame theory demonstrates that there are many ways to understand what\nexactly it means to assume that there is \u201ccommon\nknowledge/belief of rationality\u201d in a game situation.\nBroadly speaking, much of the epistemic game theory literature is\nfocused on two types of projects. The goal of the first project is to\nmap out the relationship between different mathematical\nrepresentations of what the players know and believe about each other\nin a game situation. Research along these lines not only raises\ninteresting technical questions about how to compare and contrast\ndifferent mathematical models of the players\u2019 epistemic states,\nbut it also highlights the benefits and limits of an epistemic\nanalysis of games. The second project addresses the nature of rational\nchoice in game situations. The importance of this project is nicely\nexplained by Wolfgang Spohn:\n\n\u2026game theory\u2026is, to put it strongly, confused about\nthe rationality concept appropriate to it, its assumptions about its\nsubjects (the players) are very unclear, and, as a consequence, it is\nunclear about the decision rules to be applied\u2026.The basic\ndifficulty in defining rational behavior in game situations is the\nfact that in general each player\u2019s strategy will depend on his\nexpectations about the other players\u2019 strategies. Could we\nassume that his expectations were given, then his problem of strategy\nchoice would become an ordinary maximization problem: he could simply\nchoose a strategy maximizing his own payoff on the assumption that the\nother players would act in accordance with his given expectations. But\nthe point is that game theory cannot regard the players\u2019\nexpectations about each other\u2019s behavior as given; rather, one\nof the most important problems for game theory is precisely to decide\nwhat expectations intelligent players can rationally entertain about\nother intelligent players\u2019 behavior. (Spohn 1982: 267)\n\nMuch of the work in epistemic game theory can be viewed as an\nattempt to use precise representations of the players\u2019 knowledge\nand beliefs to help resolve some of the confusion alluded to in the\nabove quote.\n7.2 Alternatives to maximizing expected utility\nIn an epistemic analysis of a game, the specific recommendations or\npredictions for the players\u2019 choices are derived from\ndecision-theoretic choice rules. Maximization of expected utility, for\ninstance, underlies most of the results in the contemporary literature\non the epistemic foundations of game theory. From a methodological\nperspective, however, the choice rule that the modeler assumes the\nplayers are following is simply a parameter that can be varied. In\nrecent years, there have been some initial attempts to develop\nepistemic analyses with alternative choice rules, for\ninstance minregret Halpern & Pass (2009).\n7.3 Further reading\nThe reader interested in more extensive coverage of all or some of\nthe topics discussed in this entry should consult the following\narticles and books.\n\nLogic in Games by Johan van Benthem: This book uses the\ntools of modal logic broadly conceived to discuss many of the issues\nraised in this entry (2014, MIT Press).\nThe Language of Game Theory by Adam Brandenburger: A\ncollection of Brandenburger\u2019s key papers on epistemic game\ntheory (2014, World Scientific Series in Economic Theory).\nEpistemic Game Theory by Eddie Dekel and Marciano\nSiniscalchi: A survey paper aimed at economists covering the main\ntechnical results of epistemic game theory (2014, Available online).\nEpistemic Game Theory: Reasoning and Choice by\nAndr\u00e9s Perea: A non-technical introduction to epistemic game\ntheory (2012, Cambridge University Press).\nThe Bounds of Reason: Game Theory and the Unification of the\nBehavioral Sciences by Herbert Gintis: This book offers a broad\noverview of the social and behavioral science using the ideas of\nepistemic game theory (2009, Princeton University Press).\n",
