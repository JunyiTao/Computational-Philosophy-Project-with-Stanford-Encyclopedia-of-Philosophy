    "main_text": "\n\n\nEgalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy. An\negalitarian favors equality of some sort: People should get the same,\nor be treated the same, or be treated as equals, in some respect. An\nalternative view expands on this last-mentioned option: People should\nbe treated as equals, should treat one another as equals, should relate\nas equals, or enjoy an equality of social status of some sort.\nEgalitarian doctrines tend to rest on a background idea that all human\npersons are equal in fundamental worth or moral status. So far as the\nWestern European and Anglo-American philosophical tradition is\nconcerned, one significant source of this thought is the Christian\nnotion that God loves all human souls equally. Egalitarianism is a\nprotean doctrine, because there are several different types of\nequality, or ways in which people might be treated the same, or might\nrelate as equals, that might be thought desirable. In modern democratic\nsocieties, the term \u201cegalitarian\u201d is often used to refer to a position\nthat favors, for any of a wide array of reasons, a greater degree of\nequality of income and wealth across persons than currently exists.\n",
