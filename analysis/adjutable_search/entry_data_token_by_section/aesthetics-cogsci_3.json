    "main_text": "Art, Empathy and Neuroaesthetics\n4. Art, Empathy and Neuroaesthetics\n\nGerman aesthetics of the late nineteenth century was particularly\nfocused on explaining human attraction to form in picturing, sculpture\nand building. Not always easy to interpret in detail, the broader\nthemes of this work include the ways that our bodily and ecological\nsituation determine the aesthetic preferences we have for such things\nas symmetry (W\u00f6lfflin 1886), how architectural form is\nappreciated in terms of its capacity to facilitate movement through\nspace (Schmarsow 1894, and how a sense of beauty arises from our\nprojecting the feelings provoked by an external object into that\nobject (Lipps 1903, see Currie 2011 for discussion). After a long\nperiod of neglect, these and related topics have reappeared under the\nbanner \u201cembodied cognition.\u201d Freedberg and Gallese (2007)\nhave drawn attention to the ways our bodies tend to reproduce the\nposture of a statue, to produce implicit or simulated movements that\nmirror those that seems to have produced a brush stroke or chisel\nmark, to resonate sympathetically with the pain of a represented\nfigure. These, they say, are intrinsic aspects of aesthetic experience\nneglected by theorists who emphasise an intellectualist approach to\nart. They also claim that evidence for these effects based on\nintrospective reports can now be supplemented by an empirically\nverified theory of brain processing that appeals to mirror and\ncanonical neurons. Critics have alleged that this approach neglects\nthe aesthetic impact of top-down factors (Kesner &\nHor\u00e1\u010dek 2017) and that motor responses are absent in many\nencounters with art (Casati & Pignocchi 2007: 410). Arguably\nthough, Freedberg and Gallese seek only to identify an aesthetic\nfactor of some significance and need not claim either exclusiveness or\nuniversality for it. Formalists in art might object even to this\nrestricted claim, arguing that what Freedberg and Gallese have\nidentified are obstructions to the sort of \u201cpurely\noptical\u201d attention to pictures that Greenberg (1960) advocated\n(on which see Steinberg 1965; Currie 2007). But here again aesthetic\nprescription cannot afford to ignore empirical work: standards of\naesthetic attention that no one has ever lived up to are not to be\ntaken seriously.\n\nAttempting to illuminate aesthetic phenomena by appeal to mirror\nneurons and other neurological processes is now so common that we have\na substantial genre of neuroaesthetic writings (see\nChatterjee 2013 for the field\u2019s growth over 30 years). What\nremains controversial, though, is the significance (if any) this\nresearch into brain structures and processes has for aesthetics. We\nhave already seen that\u2014despite the bold claims sometimes made by\nneuro-aestheticians\u2014some critics are inclined to dismiss this\nkind of work as irrelevant to evaluating the kinds of claim which\naestheticians are concerned with. Gallese and Freedberg, responding to\ncritics, say that\n\n\nno esthetic judgment is possible without [\u2026] mirroring\nmechanisms in the forms of simulated embodiment and empathetic\nengagement that follow upon visual observation. (2007: 411)\n\n\nBut to understand the aesthetic significance of facts about such\nmechanisms we need to distinguish between two claims:\n\nEvidential claim: facts about mechanisms may provide evidence to\nsupport or undermine a claim about what is involved in aesthetic\nexperience or judgement.\nConstitutive claim: facts about mechanisms may be constitutive\nparts of the story we tell about what is involved in aesthetic\nexperience or judgement.\n\n\nThe evidential claim is more plausible than the constitutive claim.\nConsider first the evidential relevance of cognitive and neurological\nmechanisms for aesthetics. We have just now referred to a dispute\nabout how much of our experience of visual art depends on a\nwork\u2019s tendency to encourage bodily empathy with what is\ndepicted. While people sometimes report experiences of these kinds it\nmay be that they vary in accessibility, with some unnoticed without\nhigh levels of attention, though still making a contribution to our\noverall liking for/valuing of the work. Studies of brain activity\nacross a range of artistic stimuli might suggest that these empathic\nresponses are very common indeed\u2014or that they are relatively\nunusual\u2014because (let us suppose) empathy has an identifiable\nneurological signature. Such studies would be useful as evidence for\nthe claim that something needs to be factored in to an account of\naesthetic experience. But the relevant something would be the empathic\nresponse, not the brain process (See Carroll, Moore, & Seeley\n2012: 54 where studies of this kind are described as\n\u201cdata\u201d for aesthetic theories).\n\nThe difference between aesthetic effects and the mechanisms that\nrealise them is an important one. Take the shimmering quality we find\nin impressionist art. It is said that this depends on the fact that\nthe visual system involves two separate processing streams and that\ncertain colour combinations are processed exclusively by one of them\n(Livingstone 2002). Should this fact, if it is one, be regarded as an\naesthetic fact? Arguably no. What matters aesthetically is the\nexperienced shimmering quality; a world in which just that shimmering\nquality was produced by some other mechanism of perceptual processing\nwould not be aesthetically different from our world, at least in this\nrespect. The same applies to scientific studies of the stimuli\nthemselves; chemical analysis of an ancient pigment might show that it\nwas a hard medium to work in, and that would be relevant to\nunderstanding the works of art produced by its means. But what matters\nis the difficulty of the medium; discovering its chemical formula\nsimply provides evidence for that.\n",
