    "main_text": "Some varieties of definition || Ostensive definitions\n1.6 Ostensive definitions\n\nOstensive definitions typically depend on context and on experience.\nSuppose the conversational context renders one dog salient among\nseveral that are visible. Then one can introduce the name\n\u2018Freddie\u2019 through the stipulation \u201clet this dog be\ncalled \u2018Freddie\u2019.\u201d For another example, suppose you\nare looking at a branch of a bush and you stipulatively introduce the\nname \u2018Charlie\u2019 thus: \u201clet the insect on that branch\nbe called \u2018Charlie\u2019.\u201d This definition can pin a\nreferent on \u2018Charlie\u2019 even if there are many insects on\nthe branch. If your visual experience presents you with only one of\nthese insects (say, because the others are too small to be visible),\nthen that insect is the denotation of your use of the description\n\u2018the insect on that branch\u2019. We can think of experience as\npresenting the subject with a restricted portion of the world. This\nportion can serve as a point of evaluation for the expressions in an\nostensive\n definition.[2]\n Consequently, the definition can with the aid of experience pin a\nreferent on the defined term when without this aid it would fail to do\nso. In the present example, the description \u2018the insect on that\nbranch\u2019 fails to be denoting when it is evaluated at the world\nas a whole, but it is denoting when it is evaluated at that portion of\nit that is presented in your visual experience. See Gupta 2019 for an\naccount of the contribution of experience to the meaning of an\nostensively defined term.\n\nAn ostensive definition can bring about an essential enrichment of a\nlanguage. The ostensive definition of \u2018Charlie\u2019 enriches\nthe language with a name of a particular insect, and it could well be\nthat before the enrichment the language lacked resources to denote\nthat particular insect. Unlike other familiar definitions, ostensive\ndefinitions can introduce terms that are ineliminable. (So, ostensive\ndefinitions can fail to meet the Eliminability criterion explained\nbelow; they can fail to meet also the Conservativeness criterion, also\nexplained below.)\n\nThe capacity of ostensive definitions to introduce essentially new\nvocabulary has led some thinkers to view them as the source of all\nprimitive concepts. Thus, Russell maintains in Human\nKnowledge that\n\nall nominal definitions, if pushed back far enough, must lead\nultimately to terms having only ostensive definitions, and in the case\nof an empirical science the empirical terms must depend upon terms of\nwhich the ostensive definition is given in perception. (p. 242)\n\n\nIn \u201cMeaning and Ostensive Definition\u201d, C. H. Whiteley\ntakes it as a premiss that ostensive definitions are \u201cthe means\nwhereby men learn the meanings of most, if not all, of those\nelementary expressions in their language in terms of which other\nexpressions are defined.\u201d (332) It should be noted, however,\nthat nothing in the logic and semantics of ostensive definitions\nwarrants a foundationalist picture of concepts or of\nlanguage-learning. Such foundationalist pictures were decisively\ncriticized by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his Philosophical\nInvestigations. Wittgenstein\u2019s positive views on ostensive\ndefinition remain elusive, however; for an interpretation, see Hacker\n1975.\n\nOstensive definitions are important, but our understanding of them\nremains at a rudimentary level. They deserve greater attention from\nlogicians and philosophers.\n",
