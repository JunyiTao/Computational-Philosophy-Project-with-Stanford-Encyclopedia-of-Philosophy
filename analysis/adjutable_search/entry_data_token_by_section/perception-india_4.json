The fourth MS\n1.1.4 says:\n\nThe arising of a cognition when there is a connection of the sense\nfaculties of a person with an existing (sat)\nobject\u2014that (tat) is perception; it is not the basis of\nthe knowledge of Dharma, because it is the apprehension of\nthat which is present. (Taber, 2005:44)\n\n\nThere is no consensus among M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 commentators\non whether this is intended as a definition of perception, even while\nan initial reading of it suggests that it may be. Kum\u0101rila, the\nnoted M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 commentator argues that the first\npart of the s\u016btra is not intended as a\ndefinition because of the context in which it figures; the\ns\u016btra-s preceding it are concerned with an inquiry into\nrighteousness (Dharma). Moreover, the s\u016btra\nconstrued as a definition of perception, results in too wide, and not\ntoo accurate, a definition, because it only says that perception\narises from a connection between the sense faculty and an existing\nobject and does not exclude perceptual error or inferential cognition.\nTaber (2005, 16), on the other hand, suggests that it is possible to\nconstrue MS 1.1.4 as a valid definition, and indeed such a construal\nwas proposed by an earlier commentator, the so-called\nV\u1e5bttik\u0101ra quoted at length by \u015a\u0101bara in\nhis \u015a\u0101barabh\u0101\u1e63yam. This, the most\nextensive commentary on the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101-s\u016btra, suggests that the\nwords of the s\u016btra (tat = \u2018that\u2019\nand sat = \u2018existing\u2019) be switched around for a\ndifferent reading for the first part of the s\u016btra, which\nwould then state that, \u201ca cognition that results from connection\nof the sense faculties of a person with that (tat) [same\nobject that appears in the cognition] is true (sat)\nperception\u201d. This switch rules out perceptual error and\ninference; both these present objects other than those that are the\ncause of the perception.\n",
