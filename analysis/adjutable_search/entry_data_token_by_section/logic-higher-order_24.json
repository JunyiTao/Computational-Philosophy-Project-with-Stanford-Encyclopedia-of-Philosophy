    "main_text": "Second-Order Set Theory\n16. Finite Model Theory\n\nThe rise of mathematical logic in the first half of the twentieth\ncentury was interwoven with different approaches to understanding the\ninfinite structures of the natural and the real numbers. With the\nemergence of computer science in the second half of the twentieth\ncentury logic went through a process of rebirth. The concepts of a\ncomputation and of a database both emphasized the need to understand\nnot so much the finite/infinite distinction as the new measures of\ndegrees of finiteness. For example, the question whether a problem can\nbe decided in polynomial time arose to challenge the well-developed\ntheory of what can be decided in finite time. The analogy between\nfinite relational structures and databases led to the emergence of\nfinite model theory. For a good review we refer to Fagin\n(1993).\n\nIn the context of finite models second-order logic does not suffer\nfrom the same philosophical problems as in the context of infinite\nmodels. It is just one language among many others. One of the early\nsuccesses was the result of Fagin (1974) to the effect that classes of\nmodels definable in existential second-order logic, i.e., in the\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)-fragment, are exactly those that are NP, i.e., that can\nbe recognized by a non-deterministic Turing machine running in time\nwhich is polynomial in the size of the encoding of the model as a\nbinary sequence. The question whether NP is closed under complements\nis notoriously open. From the point of view of second-order logic this\nis surprising because on all models, finite or infinite,\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) is of course not closed under complements. For example,\nthe class of infinite models (in the empty vocabulary) is\n\\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) but not \\(\\Pi^1_1\\). Also, the class of well-orders is\n\\(\\Pi^1_1\\) but not \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\). Therefore the following early\nresult about second-order logic on finite models was remarkable. Here\n\\(\\mon\\Sigma^1_1\\) refers to \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) in monadic second-order\nlogic, similarly \\(\\mon\\Pi^1_1\\).\n\n\nTheorem 17 (Fagin 1975) Connectivity of graphs is not\ndefinable in \\(\\mon\\Sigma^1_1\\). Hence\n\\(\\mon\\Sigma^1_1\\ne\\mon\\Pi^1_1\\).\n\n\nThis has subsequently been extended to graphs with certain other\nstructure present, see Fagin, Stockmeyer, and Vardi (1995). The proofs\nuse the Ehrenfeucht-Fra\u00efss\u00e9 games (see\n \u00a73.1)\n and their elaborations.\n\nLet \\(\\Sigma^1_{1,m}\\) denote the class of \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\)-formulas\n\\(\\exists X_1\\ldots\\exists X_k\\phi\\), where the bound second-order\nvariables \\(X_i\\) are at most m-ary and \\(\\phi\\) is first\norder. Similarly \\(\\Pi^1_{1,m}\\) and \\(\\Delta^1_{1,m}\\).\n\n\nTheorem 18 (Ajtai 1983) The property of a finite\nstructure \\((A,R)\\), where R is \\(n+1\\)-ary, of \\(|R|\\) being\neven, is \\(\\Delta^1_{1,n+1}\\) but not \\(\\Sigma^1_{1,n}\\) or\n\\(\\Pi^1_{1,n}\\).\n\n\nThis highly non-trivial theorem is one of the corner stones of the\nstudy of second-order logic on finite structures. We do not know\nwhether \\(\\Delta^1_1\\) is different from \\(\\Sigma^1_1\\) on finite\nstructures, but the above theorem gives an arity-based hierarchy\nresult inside \\(\\Delta^1_1\\).\n\n",
