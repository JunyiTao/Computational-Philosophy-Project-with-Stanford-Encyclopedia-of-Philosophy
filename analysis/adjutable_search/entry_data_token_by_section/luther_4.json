    "main_text": "Luther\u2019s Ethics and Social Philosophy\n5. Luther\u2019s Ethics and Social Philosophy\n\nLuther\u2019s rethinking of these issues of grace and salvation were\nnot seen by him as merely concerning the individual\u2019s relation\nto God, but also to have wider ethical and social implications\nconcerning the relation of individuals to one another, and of\nindividuals to the community to which they belong. It is thus clear\nthroughout his writings that Luther saw his transition from\n\u201cjustification through works\u201d to \u201cjustification\nthrough faith\u201d as having a major impact on his conception of\nethics and social philosophy.\n\nAt the centre of Christian ethics is the commandment to love\none\u2019s neighbour; but Luther thinks this is only properly\nunderstood and made possible on his account of our relation to God,\nfor a variety of reasons. First, if justification it to be earned\nthrough works, our justification remains uncertain in a way that fuels\nthe kind of introspective anxiety that makes it impossible to love the\nneighbour, by instead turning us in on\n ourselves.[30]\n Second, these works become instrumental in earning our own salvation,\nthus no longer involving genuine concern for our neighbour but only\nfor our own\n well-being.[31]\n Third, the works that will be our primary focus are religious works\nsuch as penance, and thus not ethical ones that concern the\n neighbour.[32]\n Fourth, if we think we can achieve good works without a prior act of\ngrace, this will fuel a pride and sense of self-cultivated\nvirtuousness which will cause us to look down on the neighbour rather\nthan love them, a difficulty that leads Luther to be critical of the\nkind of virtue ethics associated with the Aristotelian\n tradition.[33]\n Thus, by starting with justification through works we will be unable\nto truly love the neighbour, for as we have seen, this love will be\nblocked by a mixture of anxiety about our own salvation and pride at\nour own achievements, so finally the most we will be able manage in\nrelation to the neighbour is a kind of dutiful obedience of the\ncommandment as a law, which itself gets in the way of a genuine\nattitude of love.\n\nBy contrast, Luther argues, once we move from justification through\nworks to justification through faith, love of the neighbour becomes\npossible as these obstacles are removed. Instead of feeling both\nanxious and prideful, the believer is released from this anxiety\nthrough the promise of a grace that does not have to be earned, and\nfrom their pride by realising that this grace is unmerited. This frees\nthe individual from their self-absorption which had turned them in on\nthemselves, and enables them to face outwards towards the neighbour,\nwho they no longer view as an instrument to their own salvation. In\nexperiencing God\u2019s love of us through grace, and of\nChrist\u2019s giving of himself for us, we then turn to express this\nlove not only to God, but also to pass on this gift to the neighbour,\nthereby doing the good works we ought to do in a spontaneous way\nrather than feeling compelled to act in an imperatival\n manner.[34]\n This shift in perspective is captured by Luther\u2019s famously\ndialectical claim in The Freedom of the Christian: \u201cA\nChristian is a perfectly free lord of all, subject to none\u201d, in\nso far as the Christian is freed from following the law in an\ninstrumental manner and out of fear for its penalties; on the other\nhand \u201cA Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject\nto all\u201d (WA 7:21 (German), 7:49 (Latin)/LW 31:344), as the\nChristian feels a gratitude to God and to Christ that also opens them\nup to their neighbour, who they serve in\n love.[35]\n Luther thus insists that works still play a fundamental role in the\nChristian life, but a role that takes a different and healthier\nform.\n\nLikewise, as Luther made particularly clear towards the end of his life in his dispute with Johann\nAgricola (1494\u20131566) in his open letter Against the Antinomians (1539) and associated Disputations (1537\u201340), whilst the\nfreedom of the Christian means that they are freed from a kind of\nsubjection to the law and fulfilling it plays no role in\ntheir salvation, this does not mean that they are somehow outside or\nbeyond the law, and nor does this mean that the preaching of the law\nshould play no part in the life of the Church. As regards the latter\npoint, we have already seen that consciousness of law can play an\nimportant \u201cconvicting\u201d role in leading to the kind of\ndespair that opens us up to grace. And as regards the former point,\nwhile the Christian qua Christian will not feel the law as a\nconstraint or as a vehicle for salvation, this does not mean that the\nlaw does not apply to them. Luther also presents himself as\noccupying a similar middle position when it comes to ceremonial laws\n(cf. The Freedom of the Christian WA 7:70\u20133/LW\n 31:375\u201377).[36]\n\nMoreover, Luther\u2019s theological anthropology of course recognizes\nthat we are not just Christian, but also have to deal with\nthe \u201couter man\u201d or \u201cfallen man\u201d who still\nrequires control, so that the Christian who is also human will find it\nhard not to see the law as something before which they are required to\nsubmit, though they will do so willingly. Likewise and more generally,\nthe Christian lives in a society in which not all are good, so that\nlaws are required in order to constrain the behaviour of the\nwicked\u2014which alongside its \u201cconvicting\u201d use, is the\nother function of the law in Luther\u2019s\n account.[37]\n Such laws will require authority in those who institute and enforce\nthem, an authority grounded in the important role that these public\nbodies play in enabling fallen human beings to live together, and thus\nin fulfilling God\u2019s purposes for the world.\n\nIn recognizing how far law and the legitimacy of public authorities\nand social structures rest on the role of both in furthering the ends\nof God\u2019s creation, there is an important connection between\nLuther\u2019s ethics and social philosophy and the theistic natural\nlaw tradition. Moreover, Luther forms part of this tradition in\nfrequently arguing on the basis of Paul\u2019s statement in Romans\n2:15, that this natural law \u201cis written in the depth of the\nheart and cannot be erased\u201d (Against the Antinomians WA\n50:471/LW 47:110), so that human beings are naturally born with a\nknowledge of fundamental moral precepts, which are accessible to us\nthrough reason and felt through conscience. However, the Fall has\nimpacted on this knowledge, which is why there can also be a place for\na law that is revealed to us, as Moses did to the people of Israel,\nand preached on that basis, though in doing so what is revealed does\nnot provide us with a new law, but reawakens our awareness of the law\nthat is written on our\n hearts.[38]\n Furthermore, while the decalogue is fundamental and\n eternal,[39]\n other aspects of the law of Moses are more context specific and\nrequire further\n elaboration.[40]\n In some discussions, however, Luther distinguishes between the\nnatural law which applies and is known to all and which \u201ceven\nthe heathen, Turks, and Jews have to keep if there is to be any peace\nor order in the world\u201d, and \u201cthe law of Christ, and of the\ngospel, which is not binding on the heathen\u201d, and which requires\nmore than the former law, such as love of the enemy and the\nwillingness \u201cto give up life and property, and let whoever takes\nit have it\u201d, and thus if necessary to set aside temporal goods\n(Admonition to Peace, 1525, WA 18:307\u2013311/LW\n46:27\u201329).\n\nThis distinction reflects a wider distinction in Luther\u2019s ethics\nand social philosophy, between the structures necessary to enable the\nflourishing of fallen human beings as parts of God\u2019s creation,\nand a concern with our spiritual lives to which different\nconsiderations apply. This distinction is reflected in Luther\u2019s\nwell-known but complex and evolving distinction between \u201ctwo\nkingdoms\u201d [die zwei Reiche] and the related distinction\nbetween \u201ctwo governments\u201d (or \u201cregiments\u201d)\n[die zwei Regimente]. The worldly or temporal kingdom is\nwhere human beings live within the world, which is structured by God\nto make this possible into three \u201corders\u201d or\n\u201chierarchies\u201d or \u201cestates\u201d, which were the\npolitia or civitas, the oeconomia, and the\necclesia, namely government and state, the household and\neconomic human interactions more generally, and the Church. The\nindividual then has an office or calling or station within these\nvarious orders, which because these are divinely ordained are a way\nfor individuals within their station to serve God, and may give some\nindividuals in certain offices authority over others. Within the\nworldly kingdom, therefore, there are also worldly authorities\noperating at the political and social level (including within the\nChurch), who should exercise that authority with a view to enabling\nfallen human beings within God\u2019s creation to live together as\nwell as they can; they therefore do not get that authority from the\nworld, or exercise it on their own behalf, so that in this sense they\nalso fall under divine authority and are subordinated to God\u2019s\nspiritual kingdom, while nonetheless remaining distinguishable from it\nin terms of their primary focus, which is \u201clife and property and\nexternal affairs on earth\u201d (Temporal Authority, 1523,\nWA 11:265\u20136/LW 45:111\u20132). By contrast, \n\n\n[t]he spiritual government or authority [Regiment oder Amt]\npointed Christians above itself, towards God, to do right and find\nsalvation. (WA 51:241/LW 13:197) \n\n\nAs this is the kingdom of grace, and God\u2019s grace is present in\nChrist, it is ruled by Christ who brings the gospel and grace to human\nbeings, in conjunction with the Holy Spirit. As a spiritual being who\nis also a citizen of the world, the Christian therefore lives under\nboth governments, as well as a two-fold law, reflected in the\ndistinction between the natural and Christian law outlined\n above.[41]\n\nThis complex structure obviously raises the question of how these two\naspects of the Christian life can be related, and whether they can\ncome into conflict. Luther\u2019s position here is nuanced, as while\nhe distinguishes between these aspects in the way we have seen, he\ndoes not treat them dualistically as is sometimes suggested, by\nseparating off the this-worldly from the other-worldly, the temporal\nfrom the spiritual, the outer from the inner, or social life from the\nindividual\u2019s relation to God. Rather, in On Temporal\nAuthority, Luther argues that while \u201cno one can become\nrighteous in the sight of God by means of the temporal\ngovernment\u201d (1523, WA 11:252/LW 45:92), and while Christians who\nhave the Holy Spirit in their heart have no need of such a government\nto constrain them (1523, WA 11:249\u201350/LW 45:88\u20139),\nnonetheless the Christian who is enabled by God\u2019s love to love\nthe neighbour will thereby be engaged with what this requires of them\nin the world as a result of this neighbour love, including occupying\nits various offices and upholding its laws, which can include if\nnecessary exercising force over\n others.[42]\n The Christian will not adopt these practices for their own good, or\nthink that following them counts as a route to their own salvation;\nbut they will see that these practices can be necessary for the good\nof the neighbour, and that love for the neighbour will therefore\ninvolve not withdrawing from the world into spiritual\nother-worldliness and isolation, but engaging with it.\n\nHowever, this approach of course gives rise to a further question:\nnamely, under what conditions should the Christian be committed to\nsupporting the secular authorities, particularly when their power is\nmade greater through Luther\u2019s downgrading of the authority of\nthe Church in temporal matters. This issue was made vivid for Luther\nin the context of the Peasants\u2019 Revolt discussed above. On the\none hand, Luther places limits on political obedience, as princes have\nno absolute authority but are merely the \u201cmasks\u201d or\nlarvae of God, and so are themselves constrained to act as\nGod ordained, and so for the good of their people and in accordance\nwith God\u2019s word; the people of a prince who does wrong in these\nterms are therefore not required to obey\n him.[43]\n Moreover, such princes are not to compel their citizens on matters of\nfaith, which do not fall under their\n jurisdiction.[44]\n On the other hand, as the individual Christian should ultimately have\nlittle concern for their own temporal interests, if the secular power\nacts against those interests, the Christian will not see this as\ngiving them a right to rebel and overthrow the secular\n power,[45]\n while only God can act as its judge and inflict punishment upon those\nwho\n rule.[46]\n It remains a matter of dispute whether Luther succeeded in striking a\nstable balance here, as on other issues discussed above.\n",
