    "main_text": "Introduction || Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n1.1 Ayn Rand and Philosophy\n\nIn Rand\u2019s own words, her first and greatest love, her\n\u201clife purpose\u201d, was \u201cthe creation of the kind of\nworld \u2026 that represents human perfection\u201d, while her\ninterest in philosophical knowledge was \u201conly\u201d for the\nsake of this purpose (Journal entry for 4 May 1946; in 1997:\n 479).[1]\n Nevertheless, her interest in philosophical knowledge continued long\nafter she had created this world in her magnum opus, Atlas\nShrugged, her last work of fiction. In her non-fiction, Rand\ndeveloped a conception of metaphysical realism, rationality, ethical\negoism (rational self-interest), individual rights,\nlaissez-faire capitalism, and art, and applied her philosophy\nto social issues. She wrote polemical, philosophical essays, often in\nresponse to questions by fans of Atlas Shrugged and The\nFountainhead; lectured on college campuses; and gave radio and\ntelevision interviews. In her own words, her philosophy, \n\n\nin essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own\nhappiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive\nachievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\n(Rand 1957 [1992]: Afterword) \n\n\nCapitalism, \u201cthe unknown ideal\u201d, is for her the only\npolitical-economic system compatible with this philosophy because it\nis the only system based on respect for human beings as ends in\nthemselves. The free-market libertarian political movement, though\nlargely disowned by Rand, drew\u2014and draws\u2014great inspiration\nfrom her moral defense of the minimal state, that is, the state whose\nonly raison d\u2019\u00eatre is protection of individual\nrights.\n\nWhereas Rand\u2019s ideas and mode of presentation make Rand popular\nwith many non-academics, they lead to the opposite outcome with\nacademics. She developed some of her views in response to questions\nfrom her readers, but seldom took the time to defend them against\npossible objections or to reconcile them with the views expressed in\nher novels. Her philosophical essays lack the self-critical, detailed\nstyle of analytic philosophy, or any serious attempt to consider\npossible objections to her views. Her polemical style, often\ncontemptuous tone, and the dogmatism and cult-like behavior of many of\nher fans also suggest that her work is not worth taking\n seriously.[2]\n Further, understanding her views requires reading her fiction, but\nher fiction is not to everyone\u2019s taste. It does not help that\nshe often dismisses other philosophers\u2019 views on the basis of\ncursory readings and conversations with a few philosophers and with\nher young philosophy student acolytes. Some contemporary philosophers\nreturn the compliment by dismissing her work contemptuously on the\nbasis of hearsay. Some who do read her work point out that her\narguments too often do not support her conclusions. This estimate is\nshared even by many who find her conclusions and her criticisms of\ncontemporary culture, morality, and politics original and insightful.\nIt is not surprising, then, that she is either mentioned in passing,\nor not mentioned at all, in the entries that discuss current\nphilosophical thought about\n virtue ethics,\n egoism,\n rights,\n libertarianism, or\n markets.\n (Readers may also find the entry on\n Nozick\u2019s political philosophy\n to be of interest.) We present specific criticisms of her arguments\nand claims below, in the relevant sections of this entry.\n",
