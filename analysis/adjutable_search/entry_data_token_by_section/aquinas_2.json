    "main_text": "God\n2. God\n\nAquinas believes that natural reason can demonstratively prove\nGod\u2019s existence. The first step is to show that, for everything\nin the changeable world around us, there is a first cause, or prime\nmover, in virtue of which all other things have their existence, their\nmotion, their qualities and direction. This is the result he gets in\nhis much discussed \u201cfive ways\u201d of proving God\u2019s\nexistence (ST 1a 2.3c). Aquinas denies that Anselm\u2019s\n ontological argument\n has any force as a proof (ST 1a 2.1 ad 2; SCG\nI.10\u201311). Instead, the first three ways are\n cosmological arguments,\n based on the impossibility of an infinite series of causes.\nCommentators generally agree that what Aquinas means to exclude is an\ninfinite series of simultaneous causes, a \u201cvertical\u201d\nseries as opposed to an infinite \u201chorizontal\u201d series of\ncauses going back in time, which he does not think can be proved to be\nimpossible (\u00a73). Each of the five brief arguments ends with a\nvariation on the formula \u201cthis is what everyone calls\nGod.\u201d He puts his claim cautiously at this point, because to\ndemonstrate the existence of a prime mover falls well short of\ndemonstrating the existence of a being worthy of being called God. For\nall we have seen so far, for instance, this first cause might itself\nbe a body. But Aquinas thinks natural reason\u2014what we now call\n natural theology\u2014can\n go well beyond the five ways. ST 1a goes on to establish\nthat this first cause is not a body (3.1), nor composite in any way\nand hence entirely\n simple\n (3.7), perfect in every respect (4.2), the highest good (6.2),\ninfinite (7.1),\n omnipresent\n (8.2), completely unchangeable (9.1), eternal (10.2), supremely one\n(11.4), and possessing\n the most perfect knowledge\n (14.1). These results establish the existence of something worthy of\nbeing called God. (On Aquinas\u2019s natural theology in general see\nKretzmann 1997; Wippel 2000 chs. 10\u201313; Stump 2003 pt. I. On the\nfive ways see Kenny 1969; MacDonald 1991a; Martin 1997; Pawl 2012;\nCohoe 2013.)\n\nThe successes of natural theology, for Aquinas, have their limit. For\nalthough natural reason can establish the existence of a perfect\nbeing, it is incapable of establishing many of the features that\ndistinctively characterize the Christian God, such as God\u2019s\ntriune nature and God\u2019s incarnation as a human being. Here is a\nplace where philosophy alone, unaided by revelation, fails to yield an\nadequate theology. Since the ultimate goal of human life, salvation in\nthe life to come (\u00a78.1), requires some grasp of these Christian\ntruths, \u201cit was necessary for the sake of human salvation that\ncertain truths that surpass human reason be made known to us through\ndivine revelation\u201d (ST 1a 1.1). The study of revealed\ntheology is important, moreover, not only with respect to these\nso-called mysteries of the faith, but also in cases where the results\nof natural reason are too precarious to be counted on. Without direct\naccess through revelation, \u201cthe truth about God investigated by\nreason would be available only to a few people, after a long time, and\nwith the admixture of many errors.\u201d Accordingly, \u201cbeyond\nthe philosophical disciplines investigated by human reason, it was\nnecessary to have a sacred teaching through revelation\u201d (ibid.).\nThis sacred teaching (sacra doctrina) is the work of\ntheology.\n\nOne of the most difficult and most discussed issues in Aquinas\u2019s\nnatural theology is the limits he places on our ability to understand\nGod\u2019s nature. A sign of the difficulties to come emerges just\nafter he sets out his initial five-way proof, when he remarks,\n\nOnce it is grasped that something exists, it remains to be\ninvestigated how it exists, in order that what it is may be\nknown. But because it is not possible for us to know what God\nis, but rather what God is not, we cannot consider\nhow God exists, but rather how God does not exist. (ST 1a\n3pr; see Davies 2018)\n\n\nThat Aquinas in fact honors this constraint is far from obvious, given\nthe seemingly positive claims he makes regarding the divine nature. To\nunderstand his approach one must come to grips with his theory of\n analogical predication.\n In a case like God\u2019s goodness, for instance, Aquinas does not\nmean only to deny God\u2019s badness. It can be truly said, he\nthinks, that God is good. The difficulty is that the word\n\u2018good,\u2019 when truly applied to God, has a different sense\nfrom what it has in cases familiar to our own experience. The two\nsenses are thus not univocal, but nor are they purely equivocal, as if\nGod\u2019s goodness were wholly unrelated to the goodness we\nexperience. Instead, the usages are analogical (ST\n1a 13.5). So, \u201cwhen we say God is good, the sense is not that\nGod is the cause of goodness or that God is not bad; rather, the sense\nis that what we call good in creatures preexists in God, albeit in a\nhigher mode\u201d (ST 1a 13.2c). We can say with confidence,\non the basis of this analysis, that God is good, indeed preeminently\nso. To the extent that we are good, it is so only by participation in\nGod\u2019s goodness. But our cognitive limitations preclude a more\nadequate account of this \u201chigher mode\u201d in which God is\ngood. (On analogy in Aquinas see McInerny 1996; Montagnes 1963 [2004];\nDewan 2007; Ashworth 2014; Hochschild 2019.)\n",
