    "main_text": "The Second Quarter of the Fourteenth Century || John Dumbleton\n3.6 John Dumbleton\n\nJohn Dumbleton became Master of Arts at Oxford and Bachelor of\nTheology at Paris. He was listed as Fellow of Merton College in 1338\nand was also a founding Fellow of Queens College in 1341. He studied\ntheology at Paris in the mid-1340s, returning to Oxford around 1347:\nhe was listed again at Merton in 1348. His Summa Logicae et\nPhilosophiae Naturalis was left unfinished at his death, probably\nfrom the Black Death in 1349. \n\nDumbleton\u2019s treatise on insolubles constitutes a very small part\nof his long treatise, running to some 400,000 words, entitled\nSumma Logicae et Philosophiae Naturalis. It is preserved in\n21 manuscripts, though two omit the first part, on logic. Part I:\nSumma Logicae opens with a short treatise on signification.\nThis is essential for underpinning and defending Dumbleton\u2019s\napproach to the insolubles, for he argues for a version of\ncassatio: insolubles signify in such a way that they fail to\nexpress propositions. The reason for this failure, he says, is that an\nutterance, spoken or written, is a proposition only if it communicates\nsomething from the speaker to the hearer. \n\nDumbleton restricts the word \u2018term\u2019 to spoken sounds and\nwritten marks. Given that they don\u2019t signify naturally, he says,\nwe need \n\n... to explain first in what manner written and spoken terms signify;\nsecondly, in what manner they are imposed to signify; thirdly, in what\nmanner a term is significative of any thing whatsoever at our\npleasure; fourthly, how we come to know terms; and lastly in what\nmanner any thing can be signified by any term.\n Dumbleton\u2019s answer is that a term only signifies\nwhen and insofar as our understanding performs an act which consists\nin calling to mind or remembering the true intention of the thing by\nmeans of the proper intention of the term:\n\n\nA term\u2019s signifying to someone is nothing other than that\nterm\u2019s calling to mind the true intention of something else by\nmeans of the term\u2019s proper intention.\n >\n\n\nThis analysis of the notion of signification leads Dumbleton to the\nfirst conclusion of his treatise on insolubles: \n\nThe first of the conclusions is this: any term signifies only while\nand insofar as there is actual comprehension by it. This conclusion is\nclear like this: no term signifies by its own nature, nor by any\nnature introduced in it by an impositor, but terms only make us\ncomprehend other things; therefore, if a term signifies, it signifies\nonly while and insofar as there is actual apprehension through it.\nMoreover, an intention only signifies while there is actual\napprehension through it, but an intention signifies to us\nnaturally-before and more than a term, and the signification of a term\nderives from the signification of the intention, therefore all the\nmore so does a term only signify in so far as there is actual\napprehension through it.\n\n\nApplied to insolubles, the idea is that, although there is an\nutterance involved which signifies in some way, the order of priority\nresults in a regress whereby its signification is not well founded and\nthe utterance fails to constitute a proposition. So the scenario must\nbe rejected in proposing that the utterance does constitute a\nproposition: \n\nIf one supposes that the proposition \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019, or a similar one, is spoken, call it A, take what is\nexactly comprehended through its subject\u2014about which the\ncoupling is performed in order to produce the proposition\u2014call\nthat B. B is either proposition A or another proposition. Not another,\nbecause then there would not be a composition about the self-same\nproposition, which contradicts the hypothesis. If what is signified is\nA, then A is not the proposition \u2018This proposition is\nfalse\u2019, but this one \u2018\u201cThis proposition is\nfalse\u201d is false\u2019. The inference holds like this: because A\nis a proposition equivalent to one where the subject refers to the\nproposition A itself, which signifies in some way about A\u2014e.g.,\ntake the proposition: \u2018This proposition exists\u2019, call it\nC, referring to \u2018God exists\u2019. C is the same as the\nproposition \u2018\u201cGod exists\u201d exists\u2019\u2014so, in\nthe scenario proposed, to the subject of the proposition\n\u2018\u201cThis proposition is false\u201d is false\u2019 there\nwould then correspond a further proposition and so on ad infinitum.\nAnd because there is successive reference ad infinitum, it follows\nthat it is not fully comprehended.\n The solution presented by Dumbleton here is highly\nreminiscent of that put forward in Ryle 1951, sometimes referred to as\nthe \u201cnamely-rider\u201d solution. The upshot is that\nDumbleton\u2019s solution to the insolubles is part of a broader\nanalysis of linguistic understanding and communication. Indeed, not\nonly do insolubles fail to constitute propositions, so too do many\nother expressions.\n\n",
