    "main_text": "The Cosmogonic Turn || Spontaneous Generation\n3.2 Spontaneous Generation\n\nIf we take no-being as indeterminacy, then the problem of a first\ncause is not getting many from one nor getting something from nothing\nbut rather how differentiation emerges from the undifferentiated. The\ncommon explanation appeals to another key metaphysical\nconcept\u2014ziran \u81ea\u7136. The character\nzi \u81ea is a reflexive pronoun, and ran \u7136\nmeans to be in a certain way. Thus ziran means to be\nso-of-oneself or to be \u201cself-so\u201d (for a thorough\ndiscussion, see Bruya 2022). Ziran excludes appeals to\npurpose, deliberation or design, and the rise of the term paralleled a\ndisplacement of heaven by terms such as dao. Using\nziran to explain how things arise may seem like an evasion,\nnot much different from replying, \u201cthat\u2019s just how it\nis.\u201d If we are to avoid an infinite regress of causes, though,\nthe only possibility is to stop at something that just is the way it\nis from its own being. The role of ziran (self-so) is similar\nto the role of causa sui (self-caused) in European\nphilosophy. While classical European metaphysics attempts to isolate\nself-causality in a transcendent God, the Chinese took it as the very\nnature of existence. In this approach, there are similarities with\nSpinoza\u2019s identification of being and conatus\n(striving) and even with Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cwill to\npower\u201d.\n\nTwo important points follow. First, existence is seen not in terms of\nabstract being but rather as sheng \u751f: life, growth,\nbirth, vitality. The fundamental role of sheng appears\nexplicitly in the \u201cXici\u201d commentary on the Yi\nJing, which says that the foundation of the Changes is\nshengsheng, \u201cgenerating and generating\u201d,\n\u201cgrowing and growing\u201d, \u201cliving and living\u201d, or\n\u201cnatura naturans\u201d (Gao Heng 1998: 388). This\nphrase inspired the famous description of nature as shengsheng\nbuxi \u751f\u751f\u4e0d\u606f: generating, generating,\nnever ceasing! It is sometimes said that Chinese philosophy lacks\nontology (and thus metaphysics) because philosophers were never\nconcerned with being as such. It is more accurate to say that Chinese\nphilosophers took dynamic organization as implicit in the very nature\nof being, rather than positing an external source for motion and\norder. This means that ontology is also cosmology, even biology.\n\nSecond, if spontaneous generation is the very nature of being, then\none can legitimately attribute ziran to both the ultimate and\nto things themselves. Chapter 25 of the Laozi says,\n\u201cHuman beings follow earth, earth follows heaven, heaven follows\ndao, dao follows ziran\u201d, but chapter\n64 speaks of \u201cthe ziran of the myriad things\u201d,\nand in chapter 17, the people refer to their own ziran. This\nimmanence contrasts with the common division between God as\nself-caused and everything else as caused by God, a view which\nultimately sees being as divided into two fundamentally different\nkinds. In employing a univocal conception of being as sheng,\nChinese philosophies did not segregate self-generation from the\nworld.\n",
