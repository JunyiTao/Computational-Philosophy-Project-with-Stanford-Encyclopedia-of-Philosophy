And creativity raises a wealth of philosophical\nissues. Since art is such a salient domain of creativity, you might\nassume, at first, that the philosophy of creativity is the philosophy\nof art or aesthetics, or a branch thereof. But creativity invites\nquestions of its own that go beyond the purview of those other\nfields.\n\nNote that the adjective \u201ccreative\u201d can be applied to three\nkinds of things: a person (\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 is\ncreative\u201d), a process or activity (\u201cTell us about\nyour creative process\u201d), or a product, where the latter\nis taken broadly to include an idea in someone\u2019s mind or an\nobservable performance or artifact (\u201cThat\u2019s a creative\ndesign\u201d).\n\nNow suppose you are looking at a creative product, like a painting or\nsculpture. The philosophy of art may ask, \u201cWhat makes this a\nwork of art?\u201d and aesthetics may ask, \u201cWhat makes this\nbeautiful?\u201d. By contrast, the philosophy of creativity asks,\n\u201cWhat makes this creative? Is it just that it\u2019s new, or\nmust it meet further conditions?\u201d We may ask the same question\nnot just of artworks but of any creative product, whether it\nbe a new scientific theory, a technological invention, a philosophical\nbreakthrough, or a novel solution to a mathematical or logical puzzle.\nBeyond creative products, we can ask about the creative\nprocess: Must it proceed without following rules? Is it\nconscious, unconscious, or both? Must it be an expression of the\ncreator\u2019s agency, and, if so, must that agency be exercised\nintentionally? Exactly how does the process manage to produce new\nthings? Can it be explained scientifically? Furthermore, we can ask\nabout creative persons, or more generally, creators.\nWhat does it mean for a person to be creative? Is it a virtue to be\ncreative? What capacities and characteristics does a being need to\nhave in order to be creative? Could a computer be creative? These are\nthe kinds of questions animating the literature we\u2019ll survey\nbelow.\n\nSome of these questions have an empirical dimension, most obviously\nthose which pertain to how the creative process is actually carried\nout. Thus, much of the research we\u2019ll canvass falls under the\ninter-disciplinary umbrella of cognitive science, with contributions\nnot only from philosophers but also from researchers in neighboring\nfields like psychology, neuroscience, and computer science.\n", "toc": [{"#PhilCreaPastPres": "1.

The Philosophy of Creativity: Past and Present\n\nGiven the significance creativity has in our lives and the deep\nphilosophical questions it raises, one might expect creativity to be a\nmajor topic in philosophy. Curiously, it isn\u2019t.\n\nTo be sure, some of the most prominent figures in the history of\nWestern philosophy have been fascinated with creativity\u2014or what\nwe now call \u201ccreativity\u201d. According to some scholars, the\nabstract noun for creativity did not appear until the nineteenth\ncentury\u2014but the phenomenon certainly existed and many\nphilosophers took an interest in it (McMahon 2013; Nahm 1956; Murray\n1989; Tatarkiewicz 1980: chapter 8).\n\nTo name just a few examples: Plato (4th century BCE) had\nSocrates say, in certain dialogues, that when poets produce truly\ngreat poetry, they do it not through knowledge or mastery, but rather\nby being divinely \u201cinspired\u201d by the Muses, in a state of\npossession that exhibits a kind of madness (Ion and\nPhaedrus). Aristotle (3rd century BCE), in\ncontrast, characterized the work of the poet as a rational,\ngoal-directed activity of making (poeisis), in which the poet\nemploys various means (such as sympathetic characters and plots\ninvolving twists of fate) to achieve an end (of eliciting various\nemotions in the audience). Margaret Cavendish (1623\u20131673) and\n\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet (1706\u20131749) championed the\ncreative use of the imagination to pursue freedom, overcome prejudice,\nand cultivate natural abilities even despite social and political\noppression. Immanuel Kant\n(1724\u20131804) conceived of artistic genius as an innate capacity\nto produce original works through the free play of the imagination, a\nprocess which does not consist in following rules, can neither be\nlearned nor taught, and is mysterious even to geniuses themselves.\nSchopenhauer (1788\u20131860) stressed that the greatest artists are\ndistinguished not only by the technical skill they employ in the\nproduction of art, but also by the capacity to \u201close\nthemselves\u201d in the experience of what is beautiful and sublime\n(Schopenhauer 1859: Vol. I: 184\u2013194 and Vol. II: 376\u2013402).\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844\u20131900) argued that the greatest feats\nof creativity, which he took to be exemplified by the tragic poetry of\nancient Greece, was being born out of a rare cooperation between the\n\u201cDionysian\u201d spirit of ecstatic intoxication, which imbues\nthe work with vitality and passion, and the \u201cApollonian\u201d\nspirit of sober restraint, which tempers chaos with order and form\n(Nietzsche 1872 [1967]). William James (1842\u20131910) theorized\nabout creative genius exerts the causal power to change the course of\nhistory (Simonton 2018). This is just a glimpse of what each of these\nphilosophers had to say about creativity, and many other figures could\nbe added to their number.\n\nNevertheless, while some of the topics explored by earlier thinkers\nhave come to occupy a central place in philosophy today\u2014such as\nfreedom, justice, consciousness, and knowledge\u2014creativity is not\namong them. Indeed, \u201cphilosophy of creativity\u201d is still a\nneologism in most quarters, just as, for example, \u201cphilosophy of\naction\u201d and \u201cphilosophy of gender\u201d were not too long\nago. However, philosophical work on creativity has been picking up\nsteam over the last two decades (as shown, for example, in a few\nimportant collections of essays: B. Gaut & Livingston 2003;\nKrausz, Dutton, & Bardsley 2009; Paul & Kaufman 2014; B. Gaut\n& Kieran 2018). We\u2019ll now dive into those contributions,\nalong with earlier work, beginning with what is perhaps the most basic\nquestion one can ask in this field.\n2. What is Creativity?\n\nAs we noted at the outset, the term \u201ccreative\u201d can be\napplied to three kinds of things: a person, a\nprocess, or a product (where a product could be an\nidea, performance, or physical artifact).\n\nMost definitions focus on the product. According to one common\napproach, persons or processes are creative to the extent that they\nproduce creative products, and a product is creative if it meets two\nconditions: in addition to being new it must also be\nvaluable. Many theorists argue that novelty is not\nsufficient, because something can be new but worthless (e.g., a\nmeaningless string of letters), in which case it doesn\u2019t merit\nthe compliment of being called \u201ccreative\u201d. Immanuel Kant\nis often cited as anticipating this definition of creativity in his\ndiscussion of (artistic) genius. According to a common interpretation,\nKant defines (artistic) genius as the ability to produce works that\nare not only \u201coriginal\u201d\u2014since \u201cthere can be\noriginal nonsense\u201d\u2014but also \u201cexemplary\u201d (Kant\n1790: \u00a7\u00a743\u201350 [2000: 182\u2013197]). (Hills &\nBird [2018] challenge this reading of Kant.) This definition is so\nwidely accepted among psychologists that it has come to be known as\n\u201cthe standard definition\u201d of creativity in psychology. In\npractice, \u201ccreativity is often not defined\u201d (J.C.\nKaufman 2009: 19) in psychological experiments\u2014more on this in\n \u00a75\n below. When psychologists do explicitly adopt a definition, however,\nthey usually say that creative products are not only new, but also\nvaluable in some way, though they variously express the\nproduct\u2019s value in terms of its being \u201cuseful\u201d,\n\u201ceffective\u201d, \u201cworthwhile\u201d, \u201cfit\u201d,\nor \u201cappropriate to the task at hand\u201d (Bruner 1962: 18; A.\nJ. Cropley 1967: 67; Jackson & Messick 1965: 313; Kneller 1965: 7;\nCattell & Butcher 1968; Heinelt 1974; J.C. Kaufman 2009:\n19\u201320; S.B. Kaufman & Gregoire 2016; Stein 1953; Sternberg\n& Lubart 1999: 3\u2014for an overview, see Runco & Jaeger\n2012). A few psychologists have suggested that the standard definition\ndoesn\u2019t fully capture the concept of creativity (Amabile 1996;\nSimonton 2012b). As for philosophers, at least one of them defends the\nstandard definition with qualifications (Klausen 2010), but many of\nthem challenge it, as we\u2019ll soon see.\n\nWhile it is uncontroversial that novelty is required for creativity,\nphilosophers have refined that point. Certain examples may seem, at\nfirst, to suggest that novelty isn\u2019t really necessary for\ncreativity. Newton\u2019s discovery of calculus was creative even if,\nunbeknownst to him at the time, Leibniz got there first\u2014one of\nmany examples of what are called \u201cmultiples\u201d in the\nhistory of science (Simonton 2004). A beginning student\u2019s idea\nthat freedom is compatible with causal determinism might be creative\neven if, as she will soon learn, philosophers have been defending such\n\u201ccompatibilist\u201d theories for millennia. However, examples\nlike these do not force us to abandon the novelty requirement, but\nonly to qualify it. Newton\u2019s calculus and the student\u2019s\ncompatibilism were not new in all of history, but they were new to\ntheir respective creators, and that is enough for them to count as\ncreative. In the terminology of philosopher Margaret Boden, these\nideas are \u201cpsychologically creative\u201d (P-creative) even\nthough they are not \u201chistorically creative\u201d (H-creative).\nNotice that P-creativity is more fundamental. Anything that is new in\nall of history (H-creative) must also be new to its creator\n(P-creative). Thus, creativity always exhibits psychological novelty,\nthough it doesn\u2019t always exhibit historical novelty.\n\nAgain, no one denies that a creative product must be new, at least to\nits creator. But as we\u2019ll now see, some philosophers depart from\nthe standard definition of creativity by rejecting the value condition\n (\u00a72.1),\n or by proposing some further condition(s)\n (\u00a72.2),\n or by doing both.\n2.1 Challenges to the value condition\n\nSome theorists have argued that although creative things are valuable,\nwe shouldn\u2019t build value into the definition of creativity,\nbecause doing so is not informative or explanatory:\n\n\nKnowing that something is valuable or to be valued does not by itself\nreveal why or how that thing is. By analogy, being\ntold that a carburetor is useful provides no explanatory insight into\nthe nature of a carburetor: how it works and what it does.\n(Stokes 2008: 119; Stokes 2011: 675\u201376)\n\n\nThose who maintain that value is required for creativity might reply\nthat it doesn\u2019t need to be informative or explanatory. Being a\nman is required for being a bachelor even though it\u2019s not\ninformative or explanatory to say that bachelors are men. Stokes notes\nthat \u201ccreative\u201d is a term of praise, and uses this point\nto argue that what is creative must be produced intentionally (since\nwe don\u2019t rightly praise what is unintentional or\naccidental)\u2014an idea we\u2019ll return to below. But the same\npoint also seems to imply that what is creative must also have value\n(since we don\u2019t rightly praise what doesn\u2019t have value).\nAnd while the concept \u201ccarburetor\u201d is value-neutral, as\nshown by the fact that a carburetor can be worthless or useless (if\nit\u2019s broken), \u201ccreative\u201d, one might argue, is a\nvalue-laden concept, like \u201cprogress\u201d. Progress necessarily\ninvolves novelty or change, but we don\u2019t praise change as\nprogress unless it\u2019s good change. Likewise, defenders of the\nvalue condition urge, creativity necessarily involves novelty, but we\ndon\u2019t praise novelty as creative unless it\u2019s good\nnovelty.\n\nOther critics use counterexamples to argue that value isn\u2019t\nnecessary for creativity, the most prominent cases being ones of\nimmoral creativity. (For a collection of essays by psychologists on\nthe phenomenon of immoral or so-called \u201cdark\u201d\ncreativity\u2019, see D. Cropley et al. 2010). Putative cases of\nimmoral creativity include creative accounting to cheat investors or\ncreative testimony to mislead jurors, and the stock example in the\nliterature is creative torture or murder. One can imagine novel and\nwell-designed murders, as Thomas De Quincey once did in a satirical\nessay:\n\n\n[S]omething more goes to the composition of a fine murder than two\nblockheads to kill and be killed\u2014a knife\u2014a purse\u2014and\na dark lane. Design, gentlemen, grouping, light and shade, poetry,\nsentiment, are now deemed indispensable to attempts of this nature.\nMr. Williams has exalted the ideal of murder to all of us [\u2026]\nLike \u00c6schylus or Milton in poetry, like Michael Angelo in\npainting, he has carried his art to a point of colossal sublimity. (De\nQuincey 1827; see also discussion in Battin et al. 1989)\n\n\nInnovative ways of inflicting needless agony and craftily designed\nmurders are not good (they have no value), and yet they can be\ncreative. If this is right, then it seems to follow that creativity\ndoesn\u2019t require value.\n\nOne way of trying to save the value condition is by flatly denying\nthat torture methods can be creative, and by denying more generally\nthat creative things can be bad (Novitz 1999). But such denial seems\nad hoc and implausible\u2014\u201cevil creativity\u201d is not a\ncontradiction in terms\u2014and some have argued that this denial\nfaces other problems besides (Livingston 2018).\n\nOther theorists revise or qualify the value condition in order to\naccommodate examples of immoral creativity. Paisley Livingston (2018)\nproposes that a creative product only needs to be instrumentally\nvaluable or \u201ceffective\u201d as means to its intended end,\nregardless of whether that end is morally good, bad, or indifferent.\nBerys Gaut (2018) distinguishes between something\u2019s being\ngood (or good, period) versus being good of its\nkind. In his view, a new way of wielding blades and pulleys may\nbe creative if it\u2019s a good of its kind\u2014good as a method of\ntorture\u2014even though it isn\u2019t good. In order for something\nto count as creative, Gaut says, it doesn\u2019t need to be good; it\njust needs to be good of its kind.\n\nAlison Hills and Alexander Bird (2018) are unconvinced by such\nqualifications. They contemplate an elaborate torture device that ends\nup killing its victims immediately, \u201cwithout enough suffering on\nthe way\u201d. The device may still be creative, they hold, even\nthough \u201cas a method of torture, it\u2019s no good\u201d (2018:\n98). Indeed, they argue, a creative item needn\u2019t be good in any\nway at all, not even for its creator. The ineffective torture device\njust described doesn\u2019t satisfy its creator\u2019s preferences,\nit doesn\u2019t give him pleasure, it isn\u2019t an achievement, it\ndoesn\u2019t contribute at all to his well-being\u2014and yet, they\ncontend, it may be creative, provided that it\u2019s new and was\nproduced in the right way. Exactly what \u201cthe right way\u201d\namounts to is the topic we turn to next.\n2.2 Other proposed conditions\n\nWith or without the value condition, some theorists argue that a\nproduct must satisfy one or more further conditions, beyond being new,\nin order to count as creative. The four most prominent proposals are\nthat the product must be (i) surprising, (ii) original (i.e., not\ncopied), (iii) spontaneous, and/or (iv) agential. Each of these is a\ncondition on the process of creativity. To be clear, we are still\nconcerned with what it means for a product to be creative, but the\nproposals we\u2019ll now consider say that in order for a product to\ncount as creative, it must be brought about in the right way.\n2.2.1 Surprise\n\nMargaret Boden holds that a creative product must be \u201cnew,\nsurprising, and valuable\u201d (2004: 1; cf. Boden 2010; 2014).\nIt is perhaps most natural to assume that being surprising\u2014like\nbeing new and valuable\u2014is a feature of a product. But while\nBoden does think of creative products as surprising, her interest is\nmore fundamentally in the underlying generative process, in how a\ncreator manages to make something surprising. In her view, there are\n\u201cthree types of creativity\u201d\u2014combinatorial,\nexploratory, and transformative\u2014\u201cwhich elicit different\nforms of surprise, [and] are defined by the different kinds of\npsychological processes that generate the new\nstructures\u201d (2010: 1, italics added).\n\nCombinatorial creativity occurs when old ideas are\ncombined in new ways. Obvious examples include fictional hybrid\ncreatures or chimeras: add wings to a horse (Pegasus), add the tail of\na fish to a woman\u2019s head and upper-body (a mermaid), add a\nlion\u2019s body to a woman\u2019s head and torso (Sphinx), and so\non. Other combinations are found in analogies, such as when Niels Bohr\ncompared an atom to the solar system. The term\n\u201ccombination\u201d can refer either to the product of things\ncombined or to the process of combining them, but Boden\u2019s focus\nis on the process here, on the fact that one way to generate new ideas\nis to begin with old ideas and combine them in new ways.\n\nTo explain her other two kinds of creativity, Boden invokes the notion\nof a \u201cconceptual space\u201d, which is roughly a system\ncomprising a set of basic elements (e.g., basic ideas or\nrepresentations) as well as rules or \u201cconstraints\u201d for\nmanipulating or re-combining those elements. A conceptual space is not\na painting, song, or poem, for example; it\u2019s a way of\ncreating a painting, song, poem, or theory. The rules or\nconstraints are \u201cthe organizing principles that unify and give\nstructure to a given domain of thinking\u201d. And so a conceptual\nspace is\n\n\nthe generative system that underlies that domain and defines a certain\nrange of possibilities: chess moves, or molecular structures, or jazz\nmelodies. (1994: 79)\n\n\nWe could think of a conceptual space as not just a set of thoughts but\nalso a style of thinking defined by rules for generating new\nthoughts.\n\n\u201cWithin a given conceptual space\u201d, Boden observes,\n\u201cmany thoughts are possible, only some of which may have been\nactually thought\u201d (2004: 4). Some conceptual spaces contain more\npossibilities than others. Consider different games. Tic-tac-toe is\nsuch a simple game that all of its possible moves have already been\nmade many times over. The same is not true in chess, by contrast,\nwhich allows for a mind-boggling number of possible moves. The range\nof possible ideas is also practically inexhaustible in literature,\nmusic, the visual and performing arts, as well as the various domains\nof theoretical inquiry. And within those pursuits, there are various\n\u201cstructured styles of thought\u201d\u2014genres, paradigms,\nmethodological orientations\u2014which Boden thinks of as conceptual\nspaces.\n\nBoden argues that the elements as well as the operating rules of a\nconceptual space can be, and in some cases have been, captured in\ncomputer programs. She has used this point not only to argue that\ncomputers can be creative (a topic we\u2019ll return to below in\n \u00a75),\n but also to suggest that we should employ the computational model of\nthe mind in order to explain how humans create.\n\nWith her notion of conceptual spaces in hand, Boden says that\nexploratory creativity occurs within a given conceptual\nspace. The new idea that emerges is one that was already possible\nwithin that space, because it was permitted by its rules. \u201cWhen\nDickens described Scrooge as \u2018a squeezing, wrenching, grasping,\nscraping, clutching, covetous old sinner,\u2019\u201d Boden writes,\n\u201che was exploring the space of English grammar\u201d in which\n\u201cthe rules of grammar allow us to use any number of adjectives\nbefore a noun\u201d (Boden 1994: 79). Dickens\u2019s description may\nstrike us somewhat surprising, unexpected, or improbable, but it\ndoesn\u2019t have an air of impossibility about it.\n\nBy contrast, Boden argues, another form of creativity does. In this\nkind of case, the creative result is so surprising that it prompts\nobservers to marvel, \u201cBut how could that possibly happen?\u201d\n(2004: 6). Boden calls this transformational creativity\nbecause it cannot happen within a pre-existing conceptual space; the\ncreator has to transform the conceptual space itself, by altering its\nconstitutive rules or constraints. Schoenberg crafted atonal music,\nBoden says, \u201cby dropping the home-key constraint\u201d, the\nrule that a piece of music must begin and end in the same key.\nLobachevsky and other mathematicians developed non-Euclidean geometry\nby dropping Euclid\u2019s fifth axiom. Kekul\u00e9 discovered the\nring-structure of the benzene molecule by negating the constraint that\na molecule must follow an open curve (Boden 1994: 81\u20133). In such\ncases, Boden is fond of saying that the result was \u201cdownright\nimpossible\u201d within the previous conceptual space (Boden 2014:\n228).\n\nBoden\u2019s definition of creativity has perhaps been most\ninfluential among researchers who share her intertest in computer\ncreativity (e.g., Halina 2021; Miller 2019: ch. 3; du Sautoy 2019). In\na variation of Boden\u2019s account, one philosopher proposes that\nwhat makes a mental process creative is not that it actually involves\n\u201cthe recombination of old ideas or the transformation of\none\u2019s conceptual space\u201d, but rather that the creator\nexperiences the process as having one of those features\n(Nanay 2014).\n2.2.2 Originality\n\nMaria Kronfeldner (2009; 2018) argues that the process of making\nsomething creative must exhibit originality. As she uses the\nterm \u201coriginal\u201d, it does not simply mean\n\u201cnew\u201d; instead, it has to do with the kind of causal\nprocess the creator must employ. She motivates her view by asking why\nit\u2019s the case that, as we noted earlier, psychological novelty\nis required for creativity while historical novelty is not. Why is it,\nfor example, that Newton\u2019s invention of calculus was creative\neven if Leibniz invented it first? The answer, of course, is that\nit\u2019s because Newton didn\u2019t copy his calculus from\nLeibniz. Insofar as Newton came up with calculus independently, on his\nown, then he exhibited originality in his discovery, even\nthough someone else got there first. This originality, Kronfeldner\nargues, is essential to creativity.\n2.2.3 Spontaneity\n\nKronfeldner (2009; 2018) also argues that spontaneity is\nrequired for creativity. An idea occurs spontaneously to the extent\nthat it is produced without foresight or intentional control. If you\nwere to foresee the output of the creative process at the beginning of\nthat process, then you wouldn\u2019t need any further process to come\nup with it. So if an idea is creative, you cannot have fully seen it\ncoming. To that extent, insight comes as a surprise, hence the common\nphenomenological observation that creative breakthroughs feel like\nthey come unbidden or out of the blue: \u201cEureka!\u201d,\n\u201cAha!\u201d, a lightbulb turns on.\n\nGaut (2018: 133\u2013137) agrees that creativity requires\nspontaneity, and he points out, as Kronfeldner does, that it comes in\ndegrees. He explains that you do something spontaneously to the extent\nthat do it without planning it in advance. If you are going to act\ncreatively, he argues, you cannot set out to follow an \u201cexact\nplan\u201d\u2014a mechanical procedure, routine, or algorithmic\nrule\u2014which would give you advance knowledge of exactly what the\noutcome will be and exactly the means you'll take to achieve it. At\nthe outset of a creative act, you have to be to some extent ignorant\nof the end, or the means, or both. That ignorance opens up room for\nspontaneity and creativity.\n2.2.4 Agency\n\nSome philosophers argue that an item does not count as creative unless\nit has been produced by an agent. Consider a unique snowflake with an\nintricate shape, a distinctive sunset with stunning layers of\nred-orange hues, a novel patterning of dunes across a wind-blown\ndesert. All of these things are aesthetically valuable and new. None\nof them are creative, however, insofar as they all occurred naturally\nand were not made by an agent. Gaut uses examples like these to argue\nthat creative things must be created by agents (B. Gaut 2018:\n129\u201330; cf. B. Gaut 2010, and B. Gaut 2014b) and several other\nphilosophers agree (Carruthers 2006, 2011; Kieran 2014a, 2014b; Stokes\n2008, 2011, 2014; Paul & Stokes 2018).\n\nOf course, many theists would maintain that everything in nature is\nthe handiwork of an agent\u2014namely, God\u2014and so arguably it\nwould make sense for them to regard a natural phenomenon as creative\nif it is valuable and new. For theists, the unparalleled beauty of\nnature is a reason to praise the Creator. But this only supports the\nconceptual point that creativity, by definition, requires agency. We\nmay coherently regard valuable new things as creative if we attribute\nthem to a creative agent, as the theist does with the natural world;\notherwise, we can\u2019t. So again, it seems, creativity requires\nagency.\n\nThis leaves open the question of exactly how a creator\u2019s agency\nmust be exercised in order for the result to count as creative. Some\nphilosophers argue that the agent\u2019s act of creation must be\nintentional. Suppose you are snowboarding on a powder day\nand, unbeknownst to you, the tracks from your board result in a\npleasing new pattern as viewed from high above. The new pattern has\naesthetic value, but it isn\u2019t creative. And that is because you\ndidn\u2019t intend to make it. Underlying this intuition, as well as\nour intuitions about the natural phenomena above, is the fact that\n\u201ccreative\u201d is a term of praise, and we do not extend\npraise (or blame) for things that are not done by an agent, or for\nthings that an agent doesn\u2019t do in some sense intentionally.\n\nWhile a number of philosophers endorse some version of the agency\nrequirement for creativity, many theorists make no mention of it,\nwhether to endorse it or reject it, including all of the psychologists\ncited above. Further, at least two philosophers are willing to\nattribute creativity to natural phenomena like trees and evolutionary\nprocesses: Arnheim (2001) and, in recent work, Boden (2018). These\nlatter theorists don\u2019t discuss agency as such, but insofar as\nthe natural phenomena they call creative are not the result of agency,\ntheir view would imply that agency isn\u2019t required for\ncreativity.\n\nThe four proposals we\u2019ve just considered all say that a product\nmust arise from a certain kind of process\u2014a process that\nexhibits surprise, originality, spontaneity, or agency\u2014in order\nto count as creative. While there is wide agreement among philosophers\nthat creativity requires some special kind of process, not\njust a special product, there is no consensus on what is required of\nthe process. Of the four process conditions described here, the agency\ncondition seems to be the one that is explicitly endorsed by the\ngreatest number of philosophers thus far, though even they are still\njust a handful. And as we\u2019ve seen, the other proposed conditions\nhave serious arguments in their favor as well.\n\nSome philosophers argue that if any process requirement is\ncorrect, this has an intriguing corollary for judgements about\ncreativity: Even when we are explicitly judging only that a\nproduct is creative, we are implicitly assuming something\nabout the process by which it was made. Suppose, for illustration,\nthat the agency requirement is correct\u2014that being generated\nthrough an agential process is built into the very concept of a\ncreative product. Suppose further that you are applying that concept\ncompetently. It follows that if you come across a captivating\narrangement of stones on the beach and you judge it to be creative,\nyou are at least implicitly assuming that it was created through an\nagential process. If someone later persuades you that the stones\nhappened to be moved into place by the wind and waves, not by any\nagent but just by chance, then you may still regard the result as\naesthetically interesting but you would have to rescind your judgement\nthat it is creative. So if the agency condition is correct, whenever\nyou point to some item and say, \u201cThis is creative\u201d, what\nyou are saying, in part is, \u201cThis resulted from a creative\nprocess\u201d. Furthermore, on this view, analogous implications\nfollow if any other process condition is correct (Paul & Stokes\n2018).\n2.3 Is creativity a virtue?\n\nHaving considered what is required for something to count as a\ncreative product, and whether it must be produced by a\ncertain kind of process, we now turn to analysis of the\ncreative person.\n\nSome theorists suggest that creativity, as an attribute of persons, is\nan ability to perform creative acts or produce creative things (Boden\n2004). Others argue, however, that creativity isn\u2019t merely an\nability. An ability is something you can possess without ever putting\nit to use. You might have the ability to learn Swahili, for example,\nwithout ever making the effort to learn that language, despite having\nample opportunities to do so. Creativity is different in this regard.\nIf someone has the ability to be creative but never uses that ability\nwhen given numerous chances to do so, we would not call that person\ncreative. Creative people are not merely able to act creatively. They\nare, moreover, disposed to exercise that ability, such that they do\nact creatively, at least some of the time, when the occasion arises.\nOn this view creativity is a disposition, also referred to as\na trait (Grant 2012; cf. B. Gaut 2014b, 2018).\n\nPhilosophers have long distinguished virtues as a special\nsubclass of dispositions or traits. In Western philosophy, the\ntradition of theorizing about virtues goes back to the ancient Greeks,\nand over the last half-century it has enjoyed a renaissance in ethics\n(see entry on\n virtue ethics)\n and, more recently, in epistemology (see entry on\n virtue epistemology)\n and aesthetics (Lopes 2008; Roberts 2018; Hills 2018). Traditional\nexamples of virtues include wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage.\nShould creativity be added to the list?\n\nThe answer depends, of course, on what it means for a trait to be a\nvirtue. At the very least, a virtue is a trait that is good or\nvaluable. So whether creativity counts as a virtue in this minimal\nsense depends on whether creativity is necessarily valuable, a point\nwhich is contested, as we saw in the previous section. In fact, those\nwho contend that creativity isn\u2019t necessarily valuable often do\nso in order to prove that it isn\u2019t a virtue.\n\nBut let\u2019s suppose for the sake of argument that creativity is\nindeed a valuable trait. Is it also a virtue in some more robust\nsense? Virtue theorists commonly take their cue from Aristotle\u2019s\nclassic discussion in the Nichomachean Ethics. Citing justice\nand temperance as paradigm virtues, Aristotle asserts that a trait\nmust meet at least three conditions to count as a virtue:\n\n\nFor actions in accord with the virtues to be done temperately or\njustly it does not suffice that they themselves have the right\nqualities. Rather, the agent must also be in the right state when he\ndoes them. First, he must know [that he is doing virtuous actions];\nsecond he must decide on them, and decide on them for themselves; and\nthrid, he must also do them from a firm and unchanging state.\n(EN II.4, 1105a28\u20131105a33)\n\n\nSo, for example, if you return something you\u2019ve borrowed, that\nact exhibits the virtue of justice if and only if (1) you know that\nyou\u2019re returning what you borrowed, (2) you choose to do so\nbecause it is the just thing to do, and for no other reason, and (3)\nyou are disposed to do the just thing across the range of\ncircumstances when the opportunity arises. In addition to justice and\ntemperance, Aristotle enumerates other ethical virtues like prudence,\ngenerosity, and courage, as well as the intellectual virtue of\ntheoretical wisdom. In his view, each of these traits requires one to\nmeet the three conditions above. While he does not consider whether\ncreativity is a virtue, we may ask whether creativity also has these\nthree criteria. Does one have to meet these three requirements in\norder to count as creative?\n\nWe\u2019ll begin with the third requirement to set it to one side.\nDoes a person\u2019s act count as creative only \u201cif he does it\nfrom a fixed and permanent disposition of character\u201d? Examples\nsuggest otherwise. Consider the poet Arthur Rimbaud, who abandoned\npoetry at the age of 21 to pursue a life of adventure. The fact that\nhe never produced another poem after that does not count against the\nfact that he was a creative poet in his youth (B. Gaut 2014b). Unlike\nthe Aristotelian virtues, then, creativity does not have to be a\npermanent disposition.\n\nEven so, it would still be significant if creativity turned out to be\nlike an Aristotelian virtue in meeting the first two requirements. And\narguably, creativity does meet the first requirement. A person\ndoesn\u2019t count as doing something creative unless \u201che knows\nwhat he is doing\u201d. This was already implied by the agency\ncondition for creativity discussed earlier.\n\nWhere things get interesting is with Aristotle\u2019s second\ncriterion for virtue. In order for your action to count as virtuous,\nhe says, you have to do it \u201cfor its own sake\u201d\u2014i.e.,\nyou have to do it because you value virtue as an end itself, and not\nas a means to some external reward like praise, money, status, fame,\nor winning a competition. Consider the virtue of generosity, for\ninstance. If you give money to someone in need merely because it will\nmake you look good in the eyes of your friends, then you aren\u2019t\nreally being generous. Your act may outwardly look like generosity,\nbut it\u2019s not the real thing. To exhibit real generosity, you\nhave to pursue generosity as an end in itself; you have to help others\njust for the sake of helping others. Now contrast being generous with\nbeing polite. If you compliment your colleague on the good work\nshe\u2019s done, then even if you\u2019re doing this in order to\nmanipulate her, you are being polite to her. You can have an ulterior\nmotive for being polite. So politeness is not a virtue the way\ngenerosity is.\n\nIs creativity a virtue in this respect? That is, does being creative\nrequire acting creatively for its own sake? Matthew Kieran\u2019s\n(2014a, 2014b, 2018) answer is a qualified yes. While he grants that\nyou can be motivated by external rewards to exhibit \u201cminimal\ncreativity\u201d in producing valuable new things, he maintains that\n\u201cexemplary creativity\u201d requires you to be motivated by the\nvalue of creativity itself. Thus, in his view, exemplary creativity is\na virtue.\n\nTo support this claim, Kieran points to a research program in\npsychology which purports to show that creativity is driven by\n\u201cintrinsic motivation\u201d rather than \u201cextrinsic\nmotivation\u201d. A classic experiment in this program is \u201cthe\nmagic markers study\u201d, in which kids end up producing less\ncreative drawings when they are offered a prize (Lepper et al. 1973).\nMany other studies have reported similar results, which lead Teresa\nAmabile to conclude, at first without qualification, that creativity\nis enhances by intrinsic motivation and hampered by extrinsic\nmotivation (Amabile 1983: 107).\n\nFurther research introduced complications. In some studies, subjects\nwere given \u201cimmunization techniques\u201d whereby they were\nfirst primed or trained to focus on intrinsically motivating factors\nlike the pleasure or aesthetical value of engaging in artistic\nactivities, and it was found that when they engaged in those\nactivities afterward, external rewards actually enhanced\ntheir creativity.\n\nAs researchers interpreted these findings, offering reward can support\none\u2019s intrinsic motivation, provided that the reward works\neither to boost one\u2019s sense of agency or to provide useful\nfeedback about what\u2019s working and what isn\u2019t. Intrinsic\nmotivation is still what fuels creativity, on this interpretation;\nrewards help only indirectly, when they reinforce intrinsic\nmotivation. This lead Amabile to revise her hypothesis as the\nIntrinsic Motivation Principle (IMP):\n\n\nIntrinsic motivation is conducive to creativity; controlling extrinsic\nmotivation is detrimental to creativity, but informational or enabling\nextrinsic motivation can be conducive, particularly if initial levels\nof intrinsic motivation are high. (1996: 107)\n\n\nKieran takes this as evidence for his claim that creativity, or at\nleast what he calls exemplary creativity, requires intrinsic\nmotivation and is therefore a virtue in that respect.\n\nObjecting to this proposal, Gaut cites evidence that extrinsic\nmotivation is not always detrimental to creativity. In one study,\nstudents in an introductory psychology class came up with more\ncreative short story titles if they were offered a financial reward\n(Eisenberger & Rhodes 2001). In the studies where immunization\ntechniques were used, proponents of IMP argue that rewards enhance\ncreativity only indirectly, by buttressing intrinsic motivation. But\nin this case no such techniques were used, and so it seems the\nprospect of a reward enhanced creativity directly.\n\nFurther, Gaut argues that this point coheres with the role that\nrewards seem to play in so many real-world cases of creative\nachievement. In their quest to discover the structure of the DNA\nmolecule, Watson and Crick were driven \u201cto imitate Linus Pauling\nand beat him at his own game\u201d (Watson 1968 [1999: 46]). Picasso\nand Matisse were both spurred on by their rivalry with each other\n(Flam 2003: 37). Paul McCready says he was driven to invent his\naward-winning human-powered glider in 1977 because he needed the\nprize-money to pay off his debts:\n\n\nI felt that I didn\u2019t have the time to mess with such things, but\nI had this strong economic motivation to take an interest in\nman-powered flight, so I charged around trying to figure out a way to\nsolve it. (quoted in Sternberg & Lubart 1995: 242)\n\n\nOne historian argues that in World War II the Poles beat the French in\ncracking the Germans\u2019 Enigma Code because they were more\nterrified of German invasion (Singh 1999: ch. 4). Gaut quips:\n\u201cFear of death is a more powerful motivator than the intrinsic\nsatisfactions of code breaking\u201d (Gaut 2014b: 196).\n\nFinally, Gaut points out that even if IMP is true, it is only a\ncausal, probabilistic claim: intrinsic motivation is\n\u201cconducive\u201d to creativity; extrinsic motivation is\n\u201cdetrimental\u201d. But for a trait to be a virtue, intrinsic\nmotivation must be conceptually necessary for the exercise of\nthat trait. If we learn that someone gave to charity just to enhance\nhis reputation, we conclude that he wasn\u2019t really being\ngenerous. By contrast, if we discover that someone created gorgeous\nartwork just for the fame and glory, we may then lose some of our\nadmiration for her creativity, but we do not deny that she was being\ncreative.\n\nKieran could remind us that, in his view, intrinsic motivation is not\nrequired for all creativity, but only for the special form of it that\nhe calls exemplary creativity. Anticipating this reply, Gaut says that\nto distinguish between two forms of creativity is just to concede his\npoint. There are not two forms of generosity, one that requires\nintrinsic motivation and another that does not. If your act of giving\nisn\u2019t motivated by the right kind of reason, then it\ndoesn\u2019t count as an act of generosity at all. Thus, Gaut argues,\nto grant the possibility of non-exemplary creativity is to grant that,\nunlike generosity, creativity isn\u2019t a virtue in the traditional\nAristotelian sense.\n\nAnother way to examine relations between creativity and virtue is\nthrough the lens of virtue epistemology. Linda Zagzebksi defines a\nvirtue\n\n\nas a deep and enduring acquired excellence of a person, involving a\ncharacteristic motivation to produce a certain desired end and\nreliable success in bringing about that end. (1997: 137,\nitalics added)\n\n\nWhile there is a lot packed into this definition, what we\u2019ll\npinpoint here is the idea that virtue involves reliable success in\nachieving a desired end, and that the agent who is epistemically\nvirtuous, in particular, is one who is reliably successful in\nachieving knowledge. Knowledge requires truth, of course, so an\nepistemic virtue is a trait that is \u201ctruth-conducive\u201d.\nEpistemologists typically regard a process as truth-conducive to the\nextent that the beliefs it produces are more often true than false.\nBut Zagzebksi proposes that a process or trait may be truth-conducive\nin a different sense, insofar as it is necessary for advancing\nknowledge in some area, even if it produces a very small proportion of\ntrue beliefs. Creativity, she claims, is truth-conducive in this\nsense, and thus it qualifies as an epistemic virtue (1997: 182). Also\nnote the emphasis on agency. In contrast to contemporary western\nepistemology, virtue epistemology identifies the agent (rather than,\nsay her beliefs) as the essential locus of epistemic valence; it is\nthe agent who is epistemically good (or not). This emphasis comports\nwell with the proposal, discussed above, that the creator\u2019s\nagency is necessary for genuine creative achievement. A\nvirtue-theoretic approach thus illuminates what may (as we will\ndiscuss again later) be essential to creativity, namely, a process\nthat non-trivially involves a responsible agent.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen that even after we fix a specific referent for the\nterm \u201ccreative\u201d\u2014whether it be a person, process, or\nproduct\u2014there are lively disagreements about what it means.\nThese debates often seem to presuppose that the term always expresses\nthe same concept, for which we can seek necessary and sufficient\nconditions. But we\u2019ve also seen that some theorists distinguish\nbetween different concepts of creativity, corresponding to different\nsenses of the term \u201ccreative\u201d. In future work we may see\ntheorists develop such pluralistic approaches in more detail. The\ntrick, though, will be to give principled reasons for multiplying\ndifferent concepts of creativity so that the analyses do not simply\nreduce to saying that anything goes.\n3. Can Creativity be Learned?\n\nThere is a long tradition of thinkers who answer no to the\nquestion above. Two of the most influential are from the eighteenth\ncentury\u2014Edward Young and Immanuel Kant\u2014who were concerned\nspecifically with genius, the capacity for achieving the very\nhighest levels of creativity. In Conjectures on Original\nComposition (1759), Young says,\n\n\nAn Original may be said to be of a vegetable nature;\nit rises spontaneously from the vital root of genius; it\ngrows, it is not made \u2026. (1759 [1966: 7])\n\n\nHis idea is that originality emerges naturally from something\nimplanted in us by nature, and it can only be hindered by learning.\nYoung seems to think of learning as proceeding either through\nimitation or through the following of rules, and both, he thinks, are\ndetrimental to originality. Regarding imitation he writes,\n\n\nBorn Originals, how comes it to pass that we die\nCopies? That meddling ape Imitation\u2026 destroys\nall mental individuality\u2026. (1759 [1966: 20])\n\n\nAnd insofar as learning is \u201ca great lover of rules\u201d, he\nwarns that it \u201csets rigid bounds to that liberty, to which\ngenius often owes its supreme glory\u201d (1759 [1966: 13]).\n\nKant makes similar claims in his Critique of Judgment (1790).\nLike Young, he takes genius to be a natural capacity, though a very\nrare one:\n\n\nsuch a skill cannot be communicated, but is apportioned to each\nimmediately from the hand of nature and dies with him. (1790: \u00a747\n5:309 [2000: 188])\n\n\nIt certainly cannot be learned through imitation:\n\n\ngenius is entirely opposed to the spirit of imitation. Now\nsince learning is nothing but imitation, even the greatest aptitude\nfor learning, facility for learning (capacity) as such, still does not\ncount as genius. (1790: \u00a747 5:308 [2000: 187])\n\n\nNor can it be learned through rules, Kant holds, for genius is\n\n\nthe talent (natural gift) that gives the rule to art \u2026 the\ninborn predisposition of the mind (ingenium) through\nwhich nature gives the rule to art. (1790: \u00a746 5:307 [2000:\n186])\n\n\nFor Kant, a genius does not follow rules; a genius invents\nthe rules, indirectly, by creating exemplary works from which other\nartists might extract rules and undertake \u201ca methodical\ninstruction in accordance with rules\u201d (1790: \u00a749 5:318\n[2000: 196]).\n\nYoung and Kant are concerned with genius, specifically, but if we\nextend their reasoning to creativity in general, as Berys Gaut (2014a)\nhas noted, we can discern two lines of argument:\n\n\nThe imitation argument\n\nAll learning is a form of imitation.\nImitating someone or something is incompatible with being\ncreative.\nSo, one cannot learn to be creative.\n\n\nThe rules argument\n\nAll learning consists in the following of rules.\nFollowing rules is incompatible with being creative.\nSo, one cannot learn to be creative.\n(2014a: 266)\n\n\n\nGaut points out, first of all, that both arguments are invalid. In\nboth cases, what the premises would entail is that learning cannot be\ncreative, that, in other words, you cannot learn creatively\n(a claim about how you can learn). But even if that were\ntrue, it wouldn\u2019t follow that you cannot learn to\nbe creative (a claim about what you can learn). If you\nabsorb the advice of a creative writing manual then this act of\nlearning may not itself be creative. But if the manual is\neffective\u2014and we\u2019ll see in a moment how it can\nbe\u2014then what you will learn is how to become more creative.\n\nGaut also challenges the premises of these arguments. To start with\nthe first premise of the imitation argument, it simply isn\u2019t\ntrue that all learning proceeds through imitation, as we learn many\nthings through direct experience, trial and error, and many other\nmeans.\n\nThe second premise is also suspect. Something superficially close to\nit is true: mere copying is incompatible with being creative.\nBut to the extent that we learn from others by imitating them, this is\nnot merely a matter of copying them. When a child learns to speak the\nlanguage of those around her, she doesn\u2019t simply parrot the\nexact same sentences she hears; she absorbs the vocabulary and\nunderlying grammar in a way that enables her to form new sentences of\nher own devising.\n\nNow for the rules argument. Contrary to the first premise, it cannot\nbe the case that all learning consists in following rules, Gaut\nargues, because for any given rule there will be hard cases where it\nis unclear whether or how the rule applies to them, and so an\nindividual still has to use her own judgment in applying the rule.\n\nThe second premise is false too. Recall the distinction from\n \u00a73\n above between two kinds of rules. An algorithm serves as an\nexact plan, specifying both the outcome and the path for getting to it\nin exact detail. In contrast, a heuristic is a looser\n\u201crule of thumb\u201d that leaves room for an agent to exercise\nher own judgment, choice, and creativity in determining whether, when,\nand how to follow the rule. While algorithms, in this sense, may\npreclude creativity, heuristics do not, which is why, as we\u2019ll\nsee below, the teaching of creativity so often takes the form of\nheuristics.\n\nThere is a sense in which the question at hand can be answered\nempirically: We can show that creativity can be taught simply\nby pointing to cases where it has been taught. Gaut himself\ndiscusses such examples as they occur in mathematics and fiction\nwriting, which we\u2019ll turn to below. But while such cases may\nsuffice to show that creativity can be taught, Gaut further\nenriches our understanding by explaining how this is\npossible. He does so partly by articulating and then debunking\nthe imitation and rules arguments to the contrary. But in addition, he\noffers the following positive argument to show that creativity can be\ntaught and learned. He calls it \u201cthe constitutive\nargument\u201d because it begins with his view of what constitutes or\ndefines creativity itself.\n\n\nThe constitutive argument\n\nCreativity is a disposition\u2014involving both the\nability and the motivation\u2014to\nproduce things that are new and valuable, and to do so in ways that\nexpress one\u2019s agency through \u201cthe exercise of choice,\nevaluation, understanding, and judgment\u201d (Gaut 2014a: 273).\nAt least some people can learn to enhance their creative\nmotivation.\nAt least some people can learn to enhance their creative\nabilities.\nSo, at least some people can learn to\nbecome more creative.\n\n\n\nPremise 1 recapitulates the point we\u2019ve already seen Gaut and\nothers defend (in\n \u00a72.3\n above), that creativity is not merely an ability but a disposition or\ntrait, whereby the creative person is disposed or motivated to\nexercise that ability when given the opportunity.\n\nIn support of premise 2, Gaut argues that you can strengthen both your\nintrinsic motivation to be creative (when you take pleasure in your\ncreative activities), as well as your extrinsic motivation to be\ncreative (when you are rewarded with praise, grades, pay, etc. for\nyour creative efforts).\n\nDefending premise 3, Gaut points out that you can develop your ability\nto produce valuable new things by practising and strengthening the\nrelevant skills. And this development can be substantially aided by\nlearning certain heuristics.\n\nHeuristics are indeed a staple of education in creative pursuits from\nmathematics (draw the figure; consider special cases; consider extreme\ncases; generalize the problem; look for a related problem,\netc.\u2014see P\u00f3lya 1945; Schoenfeld 1982, 1987a, 1987b) to\ncreative writing (write what you know; be specific and detailed in\ndescribing sensory experiences; practice seeing similarities between\ndissimilar things; show, don\u2019t tell, etc.\u2014see Bell &\nMagrs 2001; Anderson 2006; Maybury 1967; S. Kaufman & J. Kaufman\n2009). Gaut also identifies several heuristics that might be used to\nfoster creativity in philosophy, even among children (cf. M. Gaut\n2010; B. Gaut & M. Gaut 2011).\n\nWith this last theme, Gaut has a kindred spirit in Alan H\u00e1jek\n(2014, 2016, 2017, 2018), who has independently proposed that by using\nvarious heuristics, philosophers can enhance their abilities to make\nvaluable contributions to their field, including ideas that are\ndistinctively creative. It has been said that anyone of average talent\ncan become a strong chess player by learning and internalizing certain\nchess heuristics: \u201ccastle early\u201d, \u201cavoid\nisolated pawns\u201d, etc. Analogously, H\u00e1jek suggests,\nphilosophy has a wealth of heuristics\u2014philosophical\nheuristics\u2014although they have not been as well documented\nand studied. Sometimes these take the form of useful heuristics for\ngenerating counterexamples, such as \u201ccheck extreme cases\u201d.\nSometimes they suggest ways of generating new arguments out of old\nones, as in \u201carguments involving possibility can often be recast\nas arguments involving time, or space\u201d. Sometimes they provide\ntemplates for positive arguments (e.g., ways of showing that something\nis possible). H\u00e1jek offers a catalogue of such philosophical\nheuristics to show that, contrary to a common assumption, creativity,\neven in philosophy, can be compatible with, and enhanced by, following\nrules.\n4. Can Creativity be Explained?\n\nUpon observing the work of creative people, it is natural to wonder:\nHow do they do that? How do people create? The issue we turn to now is\nwhether we could, at least in principle, answer this question\nscientifically, using the methods of modern empirical\npsychology and other cognitive and behavioral sciences. Those who take\na negative stance on this matter are not merely saying that, in\npractice, it would be exceedingly difficult for science to explain\ncreativity. They are saying that it\u2019s altogether impossible that\nscience could ever explain creativity.\n\nHospers (1985) defends this kind of pessimism based on the variety and\ncomplexity of creativity, given that creativity occurs not only in\nart, but in science, theorizing of any sort, engineering, business,\nmedicine, sport, gaming, and so on. At least two worries may follow.\nFirst, given the complexity of any one of these individual domains,\none might worry that there are simply too many variables to allow for\na clear explanation. Art provides a paradigmatic example. Consider an\nartwork that you judge to be masterful (a sculpture, a painting, a\nfilm). Now imagine attempting to describe or identify all the reasons\nfor which you think it is masterful. Take as much time as you like\nbut, the skeptic will urge, any long description you construct will\ninvariably strike you as woefully incomplete by comparison to the\nartwork, and the experience thereof. So, if the creative achievements\nof artists, in all of their complexity, cannot even be adequately\ndescribed, we have little reason to think that such achievements can\nbe explained.\n\nHow can theorists respond to these skeptical worries? Both the\ncomplexity and generalizability worries might be partially disarmed by\nnoting analogies between creativity and other phenomena. For instance,\nconsider the range of bodily movement involved in some of the very\ndomains of activities listed above: art, science, engineering,\nmedicine, sport. The kinds of bodily action specific to these domains\nare complex and vary dramatically: the relevant physical movements of\nthe surgeon are much different from the tennis player. However, it is\nnot plausible that this complexity and variety precludes explanation\nof bodily action in those domains. It simply implies that some\nfeatures of the explanation will be context-sensitive, that is,\nspecific to that domain of activity. And further to the analogy: the\nfact that the long description of, say, the tennis serve is incomplete\ndoes not preclude it from being apt and explanatory. If this line of\nreasoning is sound for bodily action, why not also for creative\naction?\n\nAt this point, one might argue that while complexity and\ngeneralizability worries would only show that creativity is difficult\nto explain in practice, the very nature of creativity implies, more\nstrongly, that it could never be explained, not even in principle.\nResources to support this kind of pessimism may be adduced from\nvarious past philosophers. We need to tread carefully, however, since\nmost of the figures we are about to consider were writing long before\nthe rise of the relevant sciences, so they could not have made any\nexplicit claim either way as to whether creativity could be explained\nby those sciences. Nevertheless, some of them did make claims which\nentail, or seem to entail, that creativity simply isn\u2019t the kind\nof thing that could be explained through scientific inquiry as we\nunderstand it today.\n\nThe classic expression of such a view comes from Plato. In his\ndialogues, Plato features his teacher Socrates as a spokesperson for\nhis own views, and in the Ion he has Socrates argue that\npoets do not produce poetry through knowledge or skill. When you\nexercise a skill (techn\u0113), you apply techniques, rules,\nor methods to perform a given activity, like charioteering, fishing,\nor commanding an army. In principle, one could explain these\nactivities by identifying the techniques they involve, and a student\nor apprentice could learn these activities by applying and practicing\nthose techniques. But poetry is not like that, in Socrates\u2019\nview. A poet can only imitate the application of rules or techniques,\nmimicking the surface appearance of skill. Voicing an idea that was\nfamiliar in Ancient Greek culture, Socrates suggests that poetry\nemerges instead through divine inspiration, whereby a human being is\ninspired\u2014literally \u201cfilled with a spirit\u201d,\nwith a god or goddess, with a muse:\n\n\nYou know, none of the epic [or lyric] poets, if they\u2019re good,\nare masters of their subject; they are inspired, possessed, and that\nis how they utter all those beautiful poems. \u2026 [They] are not\nin their right minds when they make those beautiful lyrics, but as\nsoon as they sail into harmony and rhythm they are possessed by\nBacchic frenzy. [\u2026] For a poet is an airy thing, winged and\nholy, and he is not able to make poetry until he becomes inspired and\ngoes out of his mind and his intellect is no longer in him. As long as\na human being has his intellect in his possession he will always lack\nthe power to make poetry or sing prophecy. [\u2026] You see,\nit\u2019s not mastery [techn\u0113] that enables them to\nspeak those verses, but a divine power. That\u2019s why the god takes\ntheir intellect away from them when he uses them as his servants, as\nhe does prophets and godly diviners, so that we who hear should know\nthat they are not the ones who speak those verses that are of\nsuch high value, for their intellect is not in them: the god himself\nis the one who speaks, and he gives voice through them to us. In this\nmore than anything, then, I think, the god is showing us, so that we\nshould be in no doubt about it, that these beautiful poems are not\nhuman, not even from human beings, but are divine and from\ngods; that poets are nothing but representatives of the gods,\npossessed by whoever possesses them. (Ion 534a-d)\n\n\nSocrates repeats this view in the Phaedrus: \u201cSome of\nthe greatest blessings come by way of madness, indeed madness that is\nheaven-sent\u201d (244a). He adds that while a poet may have some\nkind of skill, anyone who aspires to make poetry purely by skill,\nwithout the madness or the muse, will fail (245a).\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that \u201cmadness\u201d, for Plato, is\na supernatural affair. From the vantage of contemporary behavioral\nscience, we think of madness\u2014or rather, mental illness\u2014as\na pathology arising from some combination of genetic and environmental\nfactors, and those factors can be studied scientifically. So even if\ncreativity is linked to mental illness\u2014a highly controversial\nproposition\u2014it could still be entirely within the scope of\nscience. However, Plato\u2019s talk of \u201cmadness\u201d does not\nrefer to any naturally occurring pathology, but rather to the result\nof divine intervention: the poet is taken over or\n\u201cpossessed\u201d by the muse and that is precisely why he is\n\u201cout of his mind\u201d. Plato\u2019s poet suffers\ndivine madness.\n\nAccording to this story, then, the person we call a poet isn\u2019t\nreally a creator of poetry, but is merely the vessel through which a\ndivine being delivers poetry. If it is literally true that the source\nof poetry is supernatural, then poetic creativity could never be\nexplained by science, which is limited to the investigation of natural\ncauses. (For more on Plato, see Asmis 1992.)\n\nThis kind of supernaturalism has enjoyed a long afterlife in Western\nthought. In ancient Rome, the Latin term \u201cgenius\u201d\nreferred to a guiding spirit that was thought to accompany each person\nthroughout their lives. The genius of an artist would\noccasionally deliver art through that person in the manner of Platonic\ninspiration.\n\nConceptions of the artist take a new turn when the idea of genius is\ntransformed in the eighteenth century. As we saw above, Immanuel Kant\ndefines genius as a natural capacity that a certain kind of\nartist possesses innately and which partly constitutes that\nartist\u2019s identity. So rather than saying that a gifted artist\n\u201chas a genius\u201d, Kant says that such a person \u201cis a\ngenius\u201d. What distinguishes the genius is fundamentally an\nimaginative capacity\u2014an ability to engage in a \u201cfree\nplay\u201d of imagination to produce artworks of \u201cexemplary\noriginality\u201d. These works are exemplary not only in the sense\nthat they have artistic or aesthetic value, unlike \u201coriginal\nnonsense\u201d; they are also exemplary in the more radical sense of\nproviding an exemplar\u2014a new paradigm and precedent\u2014for\nlesser artists to follow. A work of genius sets a new standard of\nartistic value, and, looking to that exemplar, lesser artists may then\nextract techniques or rules for their own craft. The genius therefore\n\u201cgives the rule to art\u201d. In creating such works, the\ngenius does not follow any rules or methods. Instead the genius\ncreates art through a \u201cfree play of\nimagination\u201d\u2014where the terms \u201cfree\u201d and\n\u201cplay\u201d characterize the nature of an activity\nunconstrained by any pre-established methods or rules:\n\n\n[G]enius \u2026 is a talent for producing that for which no\ndeterminate rule can be given, not a predisposition of skill for that\nwhich can be learned in accordance with some rule \u2026. (1790:\n\u00a746 5:307\u20138; 2000 trans., 186)\n\n\nKant thought that genius, so conceived, is limited to the fine arts,\npoetry being chief among them. Meanwhile, in Kant\u2019s view, there\nis no room for genius in science, for example, where good theories and\nhypotheses must emerge from the careful application of scientific\nmethod, and so he said that even Isaac Newton, \u201cthat great man\nof science\u201d, was not a genius. We\u2019ll soon consider why\nthis view might seem to entail that creativity is inexplicable, but\nfirst it will be helpful to bring another figure, Arthur Schopenhauer,\nwho was deeply influenced both by Kant and by Plato.\n\nLike Kant, Schopenhauer thought of genius as a natural capacity that\nis limited to the fine arts. He also echoes Plato\u2019s sentiments\nabout madness, famously stating that \u201cgenius and madness have a\nside where they touch and even pass over into each other\u201d\n(The World as Will and Representation, 1859, WWV I: 190), and\nthat \u201cGenius lives only one storey above madness\u201d\n(Parerga and Paralipomena, SW 2:53, PP 2:49). In a state of\nmadness, Schopenhauer\u2019s genius is like Plato\u2019s poet in\nexperiencing a momentary loss of self, but what displaces the self is\nnot any divine being but rather a pure Idea which seizes the\nauthor\u2019s being and becomes the object of both his fascination\nand his artistic expression:\n\n\nWe lose ourselves entirely in this object, to use a pregnant\nexpression; in other words, we forget our individuality, our will, and\ncontinue to exist only as pure subject, as clear mirror of the object,\nso that it is as though the object alone existed without anyone to\nperceive it, and thus we are no longer able to separate the perceiver\nfrom the perception, but the two have become one, since the entire\nconsciousness is filled and occupied by a single image of perception.\n(World WWV I: 178\u2013179, \u00a734). \n\n\nWith their focus on genius construed as a natural capacity, figures\nlike Kant and Schopenhauer abandon the supernaturalism of the Platonic\nmuse. Nevertheless, they retain the idea that\ncreativity\u2014specifically genius-level creativity in the fine\narts\u2014is not a matter of exercising a skill or applying given\nrules, methods, or techniques.\n\nAs we noted earlier, these figures did not and could not have\nexplicitly denied that creativity could be explained by the sciences\nof the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, but they are commonly\ntaken to represent such a denial (Kronfeldner 2018). Why?\n\nPerhaps figures like Kant and Schopenhauer seem to make creativity, or\nat least creative genius, inexplicable insofar they suppose it to be\ninnate and as they have no story to tell about how one came to acquire\nan innate capacity except to say that it was either an accident of\nchance (which is no explanation at all) or a gift from God (which\nagain is not a scientific explanation). But while these figures seemed\nto think of artistic genius as being endowed entirely by nature with\nno contribution from nurture, modern genetic theory rejects that\ndichotomy. Instead of positing all-or-nothing natural abilities,\nbehavioral scientists today think in terms of genetically inherited\npredispositions. In order for a genetic predisposition to develop into\na trait with an observable phenotype, it needs to be triggered and\nshaped through a complex interaction between an organism\u2019s genes\nand certain kinds of stimuli or environmental conditions. There are\nstill open questions about exactly how, and how much, genes and\nenvironment feed into the development of any given trait, but\nit\u2019s misguided to pose the binary nature-versus-nurture question\nas if the two were mutually exclusive (see Tabery 2014). Many\nresearchers agree that some people have a stronger natural\npredisposition toward creativity than others, and that genius-level\ncreativity partly stems from such a predisposition. Even so, the\npredisposition itself can be understood scientifically in terms of\ngenetic heritability. (For a sampling of the relevant studies, see the\nessays collected in S.B. Kaufman 2013.)\n\nPerhaps creativity seems inexplicable according to these accounts\nbecause it doesn\u2019t follow rules or methods. In order to explain\nhow to do something\u2014how to build a boat or lead an army\netc.\u2014perhaps I need to be able to identify the rules or methods\nyou should follow in order to practice and apply those skills.\nHow-to explanations are instructions. But scientific\nexplanations needn\u2019t be instructions. A lot of good science\nexplains how something happens\u2014e.g., how heat melts ice\nor how a bat navigates its environment by echolocation\u2014without\nexplaining how to do it yourself.\n\nPerhaps creativity seems inexplicable according to these accounts\nbecause creators themselves do not know how they create. But a\nscientific explanation needn\u2019t be available through\nintrospection. Most people cannot explain how their own digestive,\ncirculatory, or perceptual systems work, but scientists who study\nthose systems can.\n\nAnother line of thought is perhaps implicit in Kant but comes to the\nfore in Schopenhauer, who says that \u201cthe nature of genius\nconsists precisely in the preeminent ability\u201d to\n\n\nconsider things independently of the principle of sufficient\nreason, in contrast to the way of considering which proceeds in\nexact accordance with this principle, and is the way of science and\nexperience. (World WWV: I: 192, \u00a736)\n\n\nThe principle of sufficient reason says that for every fact there is a\ncause which completely explains that fact. So the defining ability of\ngenius is to see things in a way that transcends the causal order and\ndefies all explanation.\n\nA version of this view is defended more recently by Carl Hausman (1975\n[1984], 1979, 1985) who frames it in terms of novelty that creativity\ninvolves. Hausman asserts that if a product is creative, it must be\nmetaphysically novel (or in his terms, \u201cgenuinely\nnovel\u201d) in the sense that it cannot be predicted from, or\nexplained by, prior events\u2014not even in principle. Creativity is\ntherefore incompatible with causal determination and causal\nexplanation: \u201cA causal view of explanation sets a framework for\nways of denying that there is anything new under the sun\u201d\n(Hausman 1984: ix). If something can be explained by prior causes, it\nis not metaphysically novel, and is therefore, in Hausman\u2019s\nview, not truly creative.\n\nAgainst Hausman\u2019s skeptical charge, Maria Kronfeldner (2009)\nargues that creativity is compatible with causal determination. First,\ncausal determinism does not preclude novelty or change. Determinism\nsays the emergence of new kinds of things can at least in principle be\npredicted in advance. Importantly, though, when this prediction\nbecomes true, then something new is added to the world. Of course, not\nall novelty instantiates creativity. The question is whether the kind\nof novelty involved in creativity must be metaphysical novelty, which\nis by definition incompatible with causal determination. This is\ndoubtful. Notice that, by definition, metaphysical novelty defies\nnatural laws. The production of something metaphysically novel would\ntherefore require supernatural powers. Traditional Western religions\nconceive of God as performing the miracle of creation ex\nnihilo. But are we positing a miracle every time we describe a\nhuman artifact or achievement as creative? Surely not. As noted above,\nhuman creativity is manifest in things that are novel relative to the\nagent producing them or new to human history, but both of those kinds\nof novelty (psychological and historical) are perfectly compatible\nwith causal determination. As Kronfeldner explains, creativity does\nnot preclude causes in general; it only precludes certain\nkinds of causes. A creative product, she argues, must be\noriginal\u2014which means that it cannot be produced through\na process of copying something prior. And it must be\nspontaneous (not produced through a routine or mechanical\nprocedure)\u2014which means that it is to some extent independent of\nthe agent\u2019s intentional control and previously acquired\nknowledge. (For more on originality and spontaneity, recall\n \u00a72.2\n above). Intuitively, the causes of something creative cannot simply\nbe a matter of copying or following a routine. But it may have causes\nnonetheless, and cognitive science can investigate those causes, at\nleast in principle. Indeed, as we\u2019ll see next, it is doing so in\npractice.\n5. The Cognitive Science of Creativity\n\nAlthough creativity has been relatively understudied by contemporary\nphilosophers, as we noted in\n \u00a71,\n it has been receiving a great deal of attention from psychologists\nover the past few decades. In 1950, J. P. Guilford gave a presidential\naddress at the American Psychological Association calling for research\non the topic, and the field soon took off with waves of research\ninvestigating the traits and dispositions of creative personalities;\nthe cognitive and neurological mechanisms at play in creative thought;\nthe motivational determinants of creative achievement; the range of\ninstitutional, educational, and environmental factors that enhance or\ninhibit creativity; and more. Today, the blossoming of this field can\nbe seen in the flurry of popular writing on its results; an official\ndivision of the American Psychological Association for the psychology\nof aesthetics, creativity, and the arts (Division 10); numerous\nacademic conferences; dedicated peer-reviewed journals (Psychology\nof Aesthetics, Creativity and the Arts; Creativity\nResearch Journal; Journal of Creative Behavior;\nInternational Journal of Creativity and Problem Solving);\nspecial issues of journals (Current Opinion in Behavioral\nSciences, Takeuchi & Jung 2019); literature surveys\n(Hennessey & Amabile 2010; Runco & Albert 2010; Runco 2017;\nGlaveanu 2014; Williams et al. 2016); textbooks (J.C. Kaufman 2009;\nSawyer 2012; R. W. Weisberg 1986, 2006); and a comprehensive\nencyclopedia (Runco & Pritzker 2020). According to one overview,\ncreativity has been studied by nearly all of the most eminent\npsychologists of the twentieth century, and \u201cthe field can only\nbe described as explosive\u201d (Albert & Runco 1999: 17). There\nis also a groundswell of new work on creativity in the fields of\ncomputer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics.\n\nThe present section surveys empirical work in psychology along with\nsome related work in neuroscience, while the next section\n (\u00a76)\n covers research in computing, AI, and robotics. Throughout,\nwe\u2019ll see that philosophers are actively in dialogue with these\nfields under the broad, interdisciplinary umbrella of cognitive\nscience.\n\nThe vast body of empirical research of creativity can be seen as\naddressing a variety of issues, but the central question that concerns\nus here is the one we identified above as the challenge for explaining\ncreativity: How are people creative? This question is\nanalogous to a number of other questions in cognitive science: How do\npeople perceive through sense modalities such as vision? How do they\nform concepts? How do they acquire a language? How do they make\ninferences? Just as psychologists investigate the psychological and\nneurological processes, systems, and mechanisms at work in these other\nmental operations, as well as the internal and external factors that\neither enhance or hinder these operations, they are doing the same for\ncreativity. There is no pretension to achieving a complete\nexplanation which would include each and every causal factor, and\nprovide the basis for perfectly predicting creative outcomes in\nadvance. But to the extent that we identify some of the relevant\ncausal factors involved in creativity we thereby make progress in\nexplaining creativity, just as we do with other features of the\nmind.\n\nAs we noted in\n \u00a72,\n the standard definition of creativity in psychology says that a\nproduct (idea or artefact) is creative to the extent that it is both\nnew and valuable (\u201ceffective\u201d, \u201cuseful\u201d or\n\u201cappropriate\u201d), and, in turn, people and processes are\ncreative to the extent that they produce new and valuable things. As\nwe also noted, many psychologists do not actually employ this, or any,\ndefinition of creativity in conducting their research. In one sampling\nof studies of creativity published in peer-reviewed psychology\njournals, only 38% of them included an explicit definition of\ncreativity (Plucker, Beghetto, & Dow 2004), as they rely in one\nway or another on the assumption that we know it when we see it. For\nexample, many studies use the Consensual Assessment Technique (CAT),\nwhereby experimental subjects produce things that are then rated for\nhow creative they are by a panel of experts in the relevant field; so\npaintings are rated by professional painters, stories by published\nauthors, etc. Many other research methodologies are used, as\nwe\u2019ll see below.\n\nEmpirical research on creativity departs in several ways from the\ntraditional approaches that seemed to place creativity outside the\nscope of science. For starters, in stark contrast to Plato\u2019s\nsupernaturalism, empirical psychologists take creativity to be a\ncompletely natural phenomenon. Creative people may of course be\n\u201cinspired\u201d in the sense of feeling energized or filled\nwith ideas, but rather than being literally \u201cbreathed\ninto\u201d by some god or muse, their thoughts and behaviors are\npresumed to have causes that are perfectly natural. While it is\ndifficult in practice to identify these causes, they are not in\nprinciple beyond the reach of science.\n\nFurther, the range of phenomena that contemporary researchers\ncountenance within the ambit of creativity is far broader and more\ndiverse than the traditional focus on poetry and the fine arts, as\ncreativity can be manifest in any kind of art or craft, as well as in\nthe sciences, technology, entrepreneurship, cooking, humor, or indeed\nin any domain where people come up with ideas or things that are novel\nand valuable in some way or another. Departing from Kant, genius, the\nhighest echelon of creativity, may be acknowledged in virtually any of\nthese domains, not just in the fine arts. And while a few researchers\n(e.g., Simonton 1984, 1994, 1997, 2009; Root-Bernstein &\nRoot-Bernstein 1999) venture to examine genius (so-called\n\u201cBig-C\u201d creativity), most of them focus instead on\nrelatively ordinary creative feats (\u201clittle-c\u201d creativity)\nincluding the kinds of story-making, drawing, and problem-solving that\ncan be elicited on command from regular people in experimental\nsettings. Some researchers propose that in order to understand how the\nmind generates new ideas, we should begin with even more rudimentary\nphenomena. For example, philosopher Jesse Prinz and psychologist\nLawrence Barsalou focus on how we form new concepts to categorize the\nthings we perceive, a process which they claim is creative, albeit in\na \u201cmundane\u201d rather than \u201cexceptional\u201d way\n(Prinz & Barsalou 2002; Barsalou & Prinz 1997; cf. Child\n2018).\n\nOf course, many feats of human creativity, and the ones that are most\ninteresting, go far beyond the basic formation of concepts. A major\nstep toward explaining those feats is to recognize that what we call\n\u201cthe creative process\u201d, as if it were a single, homogenous\nphenomenon, is in fact an assembly of multiple stages or operations.\nThe simplest recognition of this fact is the Geneplore model\nwhich distinguishes just two stages: generating ideas and\nexploring ideas (Finke 1996; Smith, Ward, & Finke 1995).\nThis distinction may be seen as echoing one made by philosophers of\nscience in the early twentieth century, between the context of\ndiscovery and the context of justification (Popper\n1934). Other theorists posit up to eight stages of creativity (for a\nsummary of proposals, see Sawyer 2012: 89). But the most influential\nstage-theory traces back to Henri Poincar\u00e9\u2019s lecture,\n\u201cMathematical Creation\u201d (1908 [1913: 383\u2013394]), in\nwhich he identifies four phases in his own innovative work as a\nmathematician:\n\nconscious hard work or preparation,\nunconscious incubation,\nillumination, and\nverification.\n\n\nIn his book, The Art of Thought (1926), the psychologist\nGraham Wallas endorses Poincar\u00e9\u2019s four stages with\ncorroborating evidence from the personal reports of other eminent\nscientists like Hermann von Helmholtz. Wallas\u2019s scheme, as a\ndevelopment of Poincar\u00e9\u2019s, is still the one that is most\nwidely cited, and we employ a version of it here with some slightly\ndifferent terminology and with two more substantive alterations:\ninstead of \u201cincubation\u201d, we identify the second operation\nmore generally as the \u201cgeneration\u201d of ideas, which may\ninclude unconscious incubation but may also occur in conscious,\ndeliberate thought; and we add \u201cexternalization\u201d for a\ntotal of five operations:\n\nPreparation\u2014You invest a great deal of effort\nlearning and practicing in order to acquire the knowledge, skills, and\nexpertise required for work in a given domain.\nGeneration\u2014You produce new ideas, whether through\nconscious reflection or unconscious incubation.\nInsight\u2014You consciously experience the emergence of\na new idea, which would strike you with a feeling of surprise:\n\u201cAha!\u201d, \u201cEureka!\u201d\nEvaluation \u2013 You assess the idea to determine\nwhether it should be discarded, retained, revised, or amended.\nExternalization\u2014You express your idea in a\nconcrete, observable form.\n\n\nArtists provide compelling examples (though not the only ones) of each\nof these five operations. Such examples can be especially illustrative\nsince they come straight from the artists\u2019 mouths, as they\nreflect upon, and share, their creative process. The twentieth century\npainter Jacob Lawrence was known for painting in the style of visual\nnarratives. Lawrence developed a system, much like a filmmaker\u2019s\nstoryboard, for the preparation of these paintings. He would lay as\nmany as 60 wood panels on the studio floor, each with individual\nscenes and sometimes with captions. From these storyboards, Lawrence\nwould generate and evaluate ideas and insights for a visual narrative,\nculminating in the paintings such as those in his Migration\nSeries (see Whitney Museum, 2002, in\n Other Internet Resources).\n Toni Morrison, the Nobel prize winning novelist, remarks on the\nlabors and sustained effort required at the preparation, generation,\nevaluation, and externalization stages of a creative writing process.\nCommenting on her novel Jazz, she says,\n\n\nI thought of myself as like the jazz musician\u2014someone who\npractices and practices and practices in order to be able to invent\nand to make his art look effortless and graceful. I was always\nconscious of the constructed aspect of the writing process, and that\nart appears natural and elegant only as a result of constant practice\nand awareness of its formal structures.\n\n\nShe further notes that insight does not always come in a flash,\n\n\n[I]t\u2019s a sustained thing I have to play with. I always start out\nwith an idea, even a boring idea, that becomes a question I\ndon\u2019t have any answers to. (T. Morrison 1993)\n\n\nWriter Ishmael Reed claims that insight can come unexpectedly and in\nvarious contexts:\n\n\nOne can find inspiration from many sources. The idea of Japanese\nby Spring originated in a news item that claimed the endowment to\na major university was traced to Japanese mob, the Yakuza. Flight\nto Canada began as a poem. The Terrible series began\nwhen I heard someone at party mention that there was a black figure,\nBlack Peter, in the Dutch Christmas, and by coincidence I was invited\nto the Netherlands shortly afterwards, where I witnessed the arrival\nof Saint Nicholas and Peter on a barge that floated into Amsterdam\nwith crowds looking on. I took photos of the ceremony \u2026.\n(Howell 2020: 91)\n\n\nAnd with signature profundity, James Baldwin suggested that all\nelements of the creative artistic process, from preparation to\nexternalization, require a basic enabling condition: being (and\nwilling to be) alone (Baldwin 1962).\n\nAs Wallas recognized (1926: 81), and as the above examples suggest,\nthe \u201cstages\u201d of the creative process are not necessarily\ndiscrete steps that follow one another in a tidy sequence. Creative\nwork is messy: over time you have numerous ideas, keeping some and\nabandoning others in multiple rounds of trial-and-error; you incubate\nnew ideas for one problem while you\u2019re busy externalizing your\nideas for another; and your moments of insight, evaluation, and\nexternalization trigger further generative processes that send you\ncycling through these operations many times over. It\u2019s still\nimportant to distinguish these operations, however, because, as\nresearchers are confirming, they are enabled and influenced by\ndifferent causal factors.\n\nAmong the additional stages that researchers have posited, one of the\nmost widely discussed is known as problem-finding.\nPsychologists often conceptualize creative thought in terms of\nproblem-solving: the ideas generated within the creative process are\nseen as candidate solutions to a given problem\u2014where\n\u201cproblems\u201d are broadly construed to include any creative\naim, like that of producing a particular kind of artwork or proving a\nparticular theorem, etc. (Flavell & Draguns 1957: 201; Newell,\nShaw, & Simon 1962). But following some early work by Mihalyi\nCsikszentmihalyi (1965), many researchers came to appreciate that a\nlot of creative work is done not just in solving problems but in\nfinding the right problem to begin with (Abdulla et al. 2020;\nCsikszentmihalyi & Getzels 1970; Getzels 1965; Getzels &\nCsikszentmihalyi 1975). While we agree that problem-finding often\nplays a key role in creativity, we have not assigned it to a separate\nstage, for the following reasons. Consider that you might settle on a\nproblem to work on in either of two ways. On one hand, you might\nchoose a problem to work on from a pre-existing menu of options. In\nthat case, your choice would fall under the evaluation phase;\nit\u2019s just that the idea you select is a problem that calls for\nthe pursuit of further ideas. If, on the other hand, you develop a\nnew problem, you would thereby be engaging in the\ngeneration of a new idea\u2014the new problem\u2014which\nmay emerge in a moment of insight. Einstein and his colleague\ncelebrated the novelty in such problem-finding:\n\n\nThe formulation of a problem is often more essential than its\nsolution, which may be merely a matter of mathematical or experimental\nskill. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old\nproblems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks\nreal advance in science. (Einstein & Infeld 1938: 92)\n\n\nEither way\u2014whether you \u201cfind\u201d a problem by picking a\npre-existing one or by coming up with a new one\nyourself\u2014problem-finding, though important, does not need to be\nseen as an additional operation beyond the five listed above;\nit\u2019s just a special case of generation, insight, or\nevaluation.\n\nThe next five sub-sections will respectively examine the five\noperations of creative work. Notice that three of\nthem\u2014preparation, evaluation, and externalization\u2014are\nuncontroversially ordinary activities that involve no apparent\nmystery; it\u2019s a challenge to explain them but no one is tempted\nto regard them as inexplicable or as violating the laws of nature. As\nwe saw in\n \u00a74,\n traditional skepticism about the possibility of explaining creativity\nis really focused on the two remaining phenomena: the\ngeneration of new ideas\n (\u00a75.2)\n and the experience of insight whereby an idea seems to come\nout of the blue, as if from a god\n (\u00a75.3).\n5.1 Preparation\n\nIt\u2019s myth that outsiders are more creative. To put yourself in a\nposition to create anything of value, you have to spend a great deal\nof time and effort acquiring the relevant knowledge, skills, and\nexpertise. In what has come to be called \u201cthe ten-year\nrule\u201d, Howard Gardner (1993) found that, on average, people\nspend about 10 years learning and being immersed in a domain before\nthey make any significant creative contribution to it.\n\nThough a certain amount of rote learning is required, gaining mastery\nin a field is not simply a matter of passively absorbing information.\nMuch of it involves what Anders Ericsson calls deliberate\npractice, where you focus on tasks which are a little beyond your\ncurrent abilities, but which you eventually conquer through feedback\nand repetition. Across a variety of domains\u2014including physics,\nmedicine, programming, dance, and music\u2014Ericsson found that, on\naverage, world-class performance becomes possible for people only\nafter 10,000 hours of deliberate practice in their chosen activity.\nThis finding also converges on the ten-year rule, because if you\nengage in deliberate practice four hours a day, five days a week, that\nwould add up to 10,000 hours in ten years (Ericsson, Krampe, &\nTesch-R\u00f6mer 1993; Ericsson et al. 2006).\n\nHowever, there seems to be a point at which too much formal training\ncan dampen creativity. Simonton (1984: 70\u201373) has reported that\nthe relationship between creativity and education level is an\ninverted-U, as too much schooling can reinforce familiar,\npre-established styles of thought. Even so, the point remains that,\nbefore you run into diminishing returns, years of preparatory learning\nand practice are required for exceptional creativity.\n5.2 Generation\n\nIn this section we discuss four kinds of mental capacities or\nprocesses that researchers have posited for generating new ideas.\n5.2.1 Blind Variation\n\nPsychologist Donald T. Campbell (1960, 1965) proposed that creative\nthought proceeds through \u201cblind variation and selective\nretention (BVSR)\u201d. The \u201cvariations\u201d he refers to are\nthe various ideas that might occur to a creator, and the process of\ngenerating them is \u201cblind\u201d to the extent that it is not\nguided or directed by prior knowledge of how valuable or useful they\nwill be: \u201cReal gains must have been the products of explorations\ngoing beyond the limits of foresight or prescience,\nand in this sense blind\u201d (Campbell 1960: 92, emphasis added).\nOnce ideas have been generated, however, there is a subsequent stage\nwhere the creator selectively retains some of those ideas while\ndiscarding others, and Campbell says this stage is\n\u201csighted\u201d rather than blind since it is guided by\nthe creator\u2019s judgments as to which ideas are valuable. While\nthere is little debate that selective retention is sighted in this\nsense, there has been more controversy over whether the initial\nproduction of ideas is, by contrast, blind.\n\nIn his prolific body of work, Dean Keith Simonton has extended and\nrefined Campbell\u2019s proposal. His work nicely illustrates the\ninterdisciplinary nature of creativity research as he, like Campbell,\nis a psychologist who engages with philosophers, some of whom are\nbroadly sympathetic to the BVSR theory (Briskman, 2009; Nickles,\n2003), while others are skeptical (Kronfeldner 2010, 2011, 2018). In\nearlier writings Simonton suggested, in a way Campbell did not, that\nBVSR is to be understood on the model of Darwinian evolution (Simonton\n1999a, 1999b). But Simonton (forthcoming: 2\u20133) has come to\nrescind the Darwinian framing of BVSR, conceding that it is\nmisleading. Reprising Campbell\u2019s core idea, he says that a\nprocess of generating an idea is blind to the extent that it is not\nguided by \u201cthe creator\u2019s prior knowledge of the\nvariation\u2019s utility\u201d (Simonton forthcoming: 5; cf.\nSimonton 2011, 2012a, 2012b, 2018). He stresses that blindness is not\nall-or-nothing; it comes in degrees. An example of a highly sighted\nprocess is that of using the quadratic formula to find the roots of a\nquadratic equation: you know in advance that if you apply the formula\ncorrectly, it will yield the correct answer. Examples of relatively\nblind processes include remote association and mind wandering.\n5.2.2 The Default-Mode Network\n\nDespite the foregoing criticism of BVSR, recent neuroscientific\nstudies suggest a network of brain activity that may serve the blind\nvariation role. Brain activity doesn\u2019t cease when one is not\nfocusing on a task, when one is at rest, daydreaming, and so on.\nFollowing this insight, researchers have used neuroimaging methods to\nidentify what is now called the default mode network (DMN).\nThe precise anatomy of this network is still a matter of\ninvestigation, but it is supposed to be less active when one is\nfocused on an external task (say a problem in the real world or in the\nlab) and more active when one is not so focused (Raichle et al. 2001;\nBuckner & DiNicola 2019). Notice then, that while this network is\nnot creativity-specific\u2014it is supposed to be active during\nmemory recall, imagining future events, daydreaming, and so\non\u2014it does seem especially well-suited for creativity, and\nparticularly for the random idea generation hypothesized by the BVSR\n(Jung et al. 2013). Creativity researchers in these fields often refer\nto this more \u201cfree\u201d production of ideas as\n\u201cdivergent thinking\u201d, and some argue on the basis of\nneuroimaging studies that creative thought requires cooperation\nbetween this mode of thought as well as that under \u201cexecutive\ncontrol\u201d. As one team puts the point,\n\n\nIn general, we contend that the default network influences the\ngeneration of candidate ideas, but that the control network can\nconstrain and direct this process to meet task-specific goals via\ntop-down monitoring and executive control.. (Beaty, Benedek, et al.\n2016; see also Mayseless, Eran, & Shamay-Tsoory 2015; Beaty, Seli,\n& Schacter 2019; Chrysikou 2019)\n\n\nNotice how well this comports with both the Geneplore and the BVSR\nframeworks, perhaps identifying a way to keep some of the insights of\nboth without commitment to a special creativity mechanism after\nall.\n5.2.3 Imagination\n\nAt least since Kant, theorists have identified an important link\nbetween creativity and imagination; indeed, the two are sometimes\nunfortunately conflated. Construed broadly, imagination can take\nvarious forms: sensory imagery, propositional imagination,\nsupposition, free association. Berys Gaut (2003, 2009, 2010) and\nStokes (2014, 2016) have both recently argued that, although\nimagination and creativity are distinct, imagination is especially\nwell-suited to creative thought because of its characteristic\nflexibility. They both agree that imagination is decoupled from action\n(Gaut 2003) and \u201cnon-truthbound\u201d (Stokes 2014) in the\nsense that, unlike belief, imagination is not limited by the proper\nfunction of accurately representing (some part of) the world. This\nfreedom or playfulness of imagination is crucial to generating new\nideas, since it allows one to safely \u201ctry out\u201d hypotheses,\nconceptual combinations, strategies for solutions, and so on, without\nepistemic or behavioral commitment.\n\nA series of studies illustrates both the need for non-truthbound\ncapacities in creative thought, as well as the difficulty of employing\nthem. When people\u2014children and adults alike\u2014are asked to\nimagine and draw non-existent houses, people, or animals, they depict\nthings that are strikingly similar to their familiar counterparts in\nthe real world: imagined people, for example, were generally drawn\nwith some version of a head, limbs, eyes, and so forth.\n(Karmiloff-Smith 1990, 1992: 155\u201361; Cacciari et. al 1997; Ward\n1994, 1995). This suggests that we are highly constrained in our\ncreativity by the concepts we already have. Concepts of existing\nthings are truth-bound: your concept of an animal, for example, has\nthe proper function of accurately representing the range of things\nthat are in fact animals. When you try to envision a new, fictional\nkind of animal, you begin with a mental image that exemplifies your\nexisting concept of animal, which is why you are constrained by that\nconcept. You then have to manipulate your initial image,\nvarying its features in ways that abandon the aim of accuracy, using a\ncapacity that isn\u2019t truthbound. Generalizing this point yields\nthe cognitive manipulation thesis, according to\nwhich creative thought requires cognitive manipulation, which involves\nthinking in ways that are not bound to the truth (Stokes 2014: 167).\nPlausibly, imagination is the mental capacity which is best suited to\nserve in this cognitive manipulation role. In the studies just cited,\nsubjects must use their imagination to manipulate their existing\nconcepts so as to form new ideas.\n\nRecent empirical research on visual imagery seems to corroborate this\nclaim. Various studies have identified positive correlations between\ncreative problem solving and visual image generation, image\ntransformation, and vividness of imagery (Finke 1990, 1996; Zemore\n1995; R. Morrison & Wallace 2001; P\u00e9rez-Fabello and Campos\n2007). A more recent study highlights the importance of image\ntransformation ability\u2014the ability to mentally manipulate a\ngiven image\u2014and the ability to achieve high degrees of visual\ncreativity. Further, the results of this study suggest that although\nvividness negatively correlates with the practicality of images\ncreated, vividness positively correlates with novel idea generation\n(Palmiero et al. 2015). The novelty involved is minimal, but again it\nappears that imagination, here in the form of imagery, well serves the\nrole of cognitive manipulation.\n\nStokes observes further that we can voluntarily control imaginative\nstates (in contrast with other non-truthbound states, like desires and\nwishes). And because imagination connects in important ways with\ninferential systems, as well as affective systems, the thoughts it\nproduces can often be integrated with knowledge and skills to\nformulate an innovative strategy or solution to a problem. Finally,\nthis role for imagination in creativity is not exclusive to the rich\ncreativity of artists and scientists, but indeed seems to characterize\nthe minimally creative behavior that we all enjoy. This claim is\npartly motivated by the empirical research just discussed. Here, as in\nthe more radical cases, instances of novel achievement or learning by\nsubjects requires more than rote memorization; it requires cognitive\nmanipulation of the information in the relevant conceptual space\n(e.g., combining concepts about houses and persons). This kind of\ncognitive activity is best done by using the imagination.\n\nPeter Carruthers has argued that imagination is important to\ncreativity on evolutionary grounds (2002, 2006; see also Picciuto\n& Carruthers 2014). Like the above analyses, he focuses on the\nplayfulness of imagination. Pretend play typically develops early in\nchildhood in humans. And imagination in adults provides the right\nmechanisms for generating and exploring ideas (just as required by the\nGeneplore model). Carruthers argues that imagination evolves under\nadaptive advantage as a kind of practice for adult\ncreativity\u2014and may have been accordingly selected for, aligning\nwith the putative creativity explosion of 40,000 years ago (Mithen\n1996, 1998; Harris 2000). This, he argues, is the most parsimonious\nexplanation of both the emergence and the ubiquity of creativity in\nthe human species. See B. Gaut (2009) for a critique of\nCarruthers\u2019 analysis.\n5.2.4 Incubation\n\nWhile we may generate ideas consciously in imagination, we may also do\nso during a period of unconscious incubation, when we are focused on\nsomething else. This point is illustrated by any number of famous\nstories, though some are probably embellished after years of\nretelling. Isaac Newton witnessed an apple fall from a tree (on some\naccounts, falling upon Newton\u2019s head) and thereby found the\ninsight for his laws of gravity. August Kekul\u00e9 is reported to\nhave discovered the structure of the benzene molecule while\ndaydreaming of a serpent circling upon and seizing its own tail. Henri\nPoincar\u00e9 alleged that, while boarding a bus, he enjoyed a\nneeded flash of insight that led to his discovery of non-Euclidian\ngeometry. Richard Feynman, the Nobel prize winning physicist, claimed\nto find inspiration while sipping soda and doodling at adult clubs.\nAnd Einstein reported:\n\n\nI was sitting in a chair in the patent office at Bern when all of a\nsudden a thought occurred to me. \u201cIf a person falls freely he\nwill not feel his own weight\u201d. I was startled. This simple\nthought made a deep impression on me. It impelled me toward a theory\nof gravitation. (Einstein, \u201cKyoto Lecture\u201d, translated and\nquoted in Pais 1982: 179)\n\n\nIn each case, someone is suddenly struck with a flash of insight about\none thing while engaged with something else entirely. The\nempirically-minded theorist rejects the notion that such ideas arise\nex nihilo or through divine possession. So how are they\nexplained in terms of natural mental phenomena?\n\nArthur Koestler, partly inspired by the work of Henri Poincar\u00e9\n(1908 [1913]), hypothesized that during creative thought processing,\nideas are combined in novel ways, and this combination is performed\nlargely unconsciously, by what Poincar\u00e9 called the\nsubliminal self (Koestler 1964: 164\u20135). For Poincar\u00e9\nthere are only two ways we might think of the unconscious. One, we\nmight think of the unconscious in Freudian terms, as a self capable of\ncareful and fine discernment and, importantly, distinctions and\ncombinations that the conscious self fails to make. Alternatively (and\nthis is the option favored by both Poincar\u00e9 and Koestler), we\ncan think of the unconscious as a sub-personal automaton that\nmechanically runs through various combinations of ideas. Importantly,\nthis unconscious process (or, if one likes, automaton) generates\nrandom conceptual associations and ideas. And these can then be\nfurther considered, examined, explored, and revised.\n\nThese behavioral methods can be combined with contemporary\nunderstanding of neural plasticity and the effects of cognitive effort\nand attention. Neuroscientists have long recognized that the human\nbrain is plastic\u2014stable in genetic material but\nconstantly undergoing functional change and development in neural\nnetworking in response to external stimuli, with the work of Donald\nHebb in the middle of the twentieth century being one important early\nprecedent. As Hebb put it, neural cells that \u201cfire together,\nwire together\u201d. Cell assemblies thus form as a result\nof the synchrony and proximity of the firing of individual cells.\n\n\n[A]ny two cells or systems of cells that are repeatedly active at the\nsame time will tend to become \u201cassociated\u201d, so that\nactivity in one facilitates activity in the other. (Hebb 1949 [2002:\n70])\n\n\nAnd continued attention to a problem, what some have called\ncerebral effort, causes changes in the networking of the\nbrain\u2019s cortex (Donald 2001: 175\u20138). Importantly, these\nchanges can continue to take place, to \u201creverberate\u201d even\nafter one has removed attention from that problem. This motivates a\nsimple (and somewhat unsurprising) hypothesis: attending to and\nperforming cognitive tasks affects neural networking (Posner et al.\n1997; Posner & Raichle 1994; see also Kami et al. 1995), and those\nchanges can involve strengthening of synaptic connectivity (which\ncorrelate with conceptual connections and associations). These\nchanges, again, can occur both when one is attending to a task and\nafter one has diverted attention elsewhere. And, finally, the latter\ngoes some way to explain a moment of insight after incubation (the\nso-called incubation effect): when one returns attention to the target\nproblem, new or newly strengthened neural connectivity (as a result of\nprevious cognitive effort) can give rise to a new idea. And because\nthat neural process is not in any sense done by you, the\nemergence of the new idea can feel like a burst of insight (see Stokes\n2007; Thagard & Stewart 2011; Ritter & Dijksterhuis 2014; and\nHeilman 2016).\n\nThere are also various recent studies on closely related topics: on\nmindwandering and spontaneous thought (Christoff et al. 2016; Irving\n& Thompson 2018; Murray et al. forthcoming), on so-called\n\u201cdivergent thinking\u201d (Mekern et al. 2019), and more on the\nneural basis of insight (Jung-Beeman et al. 2004; Bowden et al. 2005;\nLimb & Braun 2008; Dietrich & Kanso 2010; Kounios & Beeman\n2014).\n5.3 Insight\n\nIt should be intuitive that creativity often involves solving problems\nand doing so in interesting or surprising ways. In exceptional cases,\nthe individual identifies a problem solution that perhaps no one\n(including the creator) anticipated. But there are countless examples\nof more mundane instances of problem solving, where the solution may\nbe surprising (or especially interesting) to only a few individuals,\nperhaps even only to the problem solver. One broad, standard\nexperimental method used by researchers thus focuses on\ninsight in problem solving. Some problems (thankfully!) can\nbe solved by straightforward appeal to memory, or by applying some\ntechnique or method of calculation in a mechanical way. Solving the\nproblem may still take time and effort, but the solution will come so\nlong as one executes the appropriate strategy or applies the relevant\nknowledge from memory. An insight problem, by contrast, typically\nrequires something new on the part of the individual, and one must\noften \u201cchange views\u201d of the structure of the very problem.\nPredictably, there are a variety of definitions or characterizations\nof \u201cinsight\u201d in the literature. Here are two recent,\nrepresentative examples. Bowden et al. suggest that insight occurs\n\n\nwhen a solver breaks free of unwarranted assumptions, or forms novel,\ntask-related connections between existing concepts or skills. (Bowden\net al. 2005: 322)\n\n\nMore recently, Kounios and Beeman write,\n\n\nwe define insight as any sudden comprehension, realization, or problem\nsolution that involves a reorganization of the elements of a\nperson\u2019s mental representation of a stimulus, situation, or\nevent to yield a nonobvious or nondominant interpretation. (2014:\n74)\n\n\nSome early studies on these phenomena centered around a familiar\nobservation. Consider the tip-of the-tongue phenomenon, when you know\nthat you know some bit of information (an actor\u2019s name or the\ntitle of a song) but, try as you may, you just can\u2019t recall it.\nIt often helps to give up for a moment and allow the memory to surface\nwithout effort. Researchers found that the same\napproach\u2014forgetting about a problem\u2014works well to overcome\nfixation on ineffective ideas so as to allow the actual solution to\npop up. Smith and Blankenship primed two groups of subjects with\ninappropriate or misleading solutions to problems. They left one group\nto continue struggling with the same problem, while they distracted\nthe second group with a distinct but cognitively demanding task. The\nsecond group thereby overcame fixation and outperformed the first\ngroup when returning attention to the original target problem (Smith\n& Blankenship 1989, 1991; see also Smith, Ward, & Finke\n1995).\n\nIn the context of creativity in particular, there is precedent, or at\nleast overlap, in Colin Martindale\u2019s cortical arousal theory.\nThis theory centers around the nature of focuses of attention\n(Martindale 1977, 1981, 1995, 1999; Martindale & Armstrong 1974;\nMartindale & Hines 1975). Martindale proposes a multi-stage model\nof problem solving, which if the right mechanism is possessed, leads\nto creative thought. In the initial stages, information is gathered,\nvarious approaches are taken to the problem, and there is a high level\nof cortical arousal with a narrow focus of attention. As information\nincreases and the problem remains unsolved, two kinds of responses may\noccur. The first kind of response is to keep attempting the same\nsolutions to the problem such that the arousal and attention focus\nstay high and narrow, respectively. Alternatively, some persons\nexperience a decrease in cortical arousal coupled with a wider range\nof attention focus. Information then enters what Martindale calls\nprimary processing: a kind of subconscious cognition not under the\ncomplete control of the agent. It is this kind of processing, and the\narousal mechanisms that enable it, that distinguish creative insight\nor achievement from non-creative ones. The first kind of response\ntypically results in frustration and failure (fixation), while the\nsecond often results in creative insight.\n\nThere are at least two, separable components of insight thus\nunderstood. First, an insight problem requires non-mechanical or\nnon-algorithmic solution, and this in turn requires some kind of\nconceptual reorganization. A hackneyed phrase may come to mind here:\none has to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d.\n\nThe second element of insight as understood here is subjective or\nphenomenological. An insightful problem solution is often described as\noccurring suddenly and with little or no apparent effort. It is an aha\nmoment, even if less dramatic than the traditionally romanticized\nEureka moment. One way researchers have tested for this subjective\nfeature is to ask subjects to report nearness or \u201cwarmth\u201d\nrelative to solving a problem. They find that for insight problems, by\ncontrast to non-insight problems, subjects report that as they near\nsolution they experience abrupt changes in the sense of warmth for\nsolving the problem (Metcalfe & Wiebe 1987; see also Dominowski\n1995; Laukkonen & Tangen 2018). More recently, researchers have\nbegun to employ neuroimaging techniques to study insight and\ninsightful problem solving (Luo & Niki 2003; Mai et al. 2004).\n\nFirst, researchers have developed methods for using subjective report,\nwhere subjects rate whether they felt that they used insight in\nsolving a designated problem (Bowden et al. 2005). And second, and\ncoupled with those report methods, researchers have developed simple\nproblems that can be solved with insight. One such example is the\n\u201cCompound remote associates problem\u201d (CRA). Here is an\nexample of a CRA problem:\n\n\nEach of the three words in (a) and (b) below can form a compound word\nor two-word phrase with the solution word. The solution word can come\nbefore or after any of the problem words.\n\nfrench, car, shoe\nboot, summer,\n ground[1]\n\n\n(Bowden et al. 2005: 324)\n\n\nBecause of their simplicity, these problems can be solved\nunambiguously and quickly, and with this speed comes better potential\nfor neuroimaging study. In instances where subjects report insight\nsolutions to these kinds of problems,\n\n\nEEG shows a burst of high-frequency (gamma-band) EEG activity over the\nright temporal lobe, and fMRI shows a corresponding change in blood\nflow in the medial aspect of the right anterior superior temporal\ngyrus (Jung-Beeman et al. 2004). (Kounios & Beeman 2014: 78)\n\n\nThe question for neuroscientists is whether this convergence of\nevidence is sufficient to establish neural correlates of insight.\n5.4 Evaluation\n\nA moment of \u201cinsight\u201d can be misleading, as what initially\nstrikes you as a promising idea may ultimately turn out to be a dead\nend. You may have countless ideas in the course of undertaking a\ncomplex creative project, while only a few of them will make the final\ncut. A crucial part of your creative work therefore consists in\nevaluating your ideas. For any idea that occurs to you, you might have\nto ask: Will this work? Is it new? How does it fit in with other parts\nof your project? Do you have the resources and abilities to bring it\nto fruition? Is it worth the time and effort?\n\nMuch of the research on this phase of the creative process is\nconcerned to identify and categorize the range of factors that people\ntake into consider as they evaluate their ideas (Blair & Mumford\n2007; Dailey & Mumford, 2006). Unsurprisingly, those factors vary\nfrom one domain to another. New culinary dishes are judged by factors\nlike aroma, taste, texture, color, presentation (Horng & Lin\n2009), whereas improved musical performances are judged according to\ntheir complexity, originality, and technical virtuosity (Eisenberg\n& Thompson 2003), and so on. Your understanding of the relevant\nfactors is part of your internalized model of the domain (Bink &\nMarsh, 2000; Csikszentmihalyi & Sawyer 1995). And since you\nacquired and refined that model through years of preparation, your\ncapacity for evaluation is largely a consequence of your efforts from\nthat initial stage.\n\nSomewhat more surprisingly, there is some evidence that people who are\ngood at evaluating ideas are also good at generating them (Runco 1991;\nRunco & Dow 2004; Runco & Chand 1994; Runco & Vega\n1990).\n\nOther studies support what Sawyer calls Sawyer (2012: 131) calls the\nproductivity theory, which says that the best way to get good\nideas is to have lots of ideas and just throw away the bad ones. In\nhistoriometric studies, Simonton found that creators who yielded the\ngreatest number of works over their lifetimes were mostly likely to\nproduce works that were significant and stood the test of time. Even\nmore striking, he discovered that, from year to year, the periods when\ncreators were most productive were also the ones in which they were\nmost likely to do exceptional work (Simonton 1988a, 1988b). Linus\nPauling, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 as well as the\nNobel Peace Prize in 1962, summed up the productivity theory in a\nfamous remark:\n\n\nIf you want to have good ideas you must have many ideas. Most of them\nwill be wrong, and what you have to learn is which ones to throw away.\n(quoted by Crick 1995 [time 34:57])\n\n5.5 Externalization\n\nThe final operation of the creative process\u2014externalizing\nideas\u2014may involve any number of disparate activities, which\nKeith Sawyer sums up as follows:\n\n\nCreativity research has tended to focus on the early stages of the\neight-stage creative process\u2014particularly on the idea-generating\nstage. But a lot has to happen to make any idea a reality. Successful\ncreators are skilled at executing their ideas, predicting how others\nmight react to them and being prepared to respond, identifying the\nnecessary resources to make them successful, forming plans for\nimplementing the ideas, and improvising to adjust their plans as new\ninformation arrives. These activities are important in all creativity,\nbut are likely to be even more important in practical domains such as\ntechnological invention and entrepreneurship (Mumford, 2003;\nPolicastro & Gardner, 1999). (Sawyer 2012: 133\u20134)\n\n\nIt may be tempting to assume that the real creative work is finished\nonce a new idea emerges in the moment of insight, and that\nexternalization is just the uncreative, mechanical chore of making the\nidea public. But a closer look at the phenomenon reveals that\nexternalization is often integral to creativity itself.\n\nVera John-Steiner (1985) interviewed, and examined the notebooks of,\nover 70 exceptional creators (ranging from author Ana\u00efs Nin to\ncomposer Aaron Copland), and consulted the notebook of another 50\neminent historical creators such as Leo Tolstoy and Marie Curie. A\nrecurring theme throughout was that at the beginning of each creative\nendeavor and continually throughout its development, creators\nmanipulate and build upon their impressions, inklings, and tentative\nhunches using sketches, outlines, and other external\nrepresentations.\n\nPerkins (1981) corroborated this finding by analyzing the 61 sketches\nPicasso made en route to painting his famous work, Guernica,\nas well as Beethoven\u2019s musical drafts and Darwin\u2019s\nnotebooks. In each case, the artist progressed by engaging with\nexternal representations.\n\nOther studies found that people discovered and solved more problem\nwhen they used sketches during a task (Verstijnen 1997), and that\npeople come up with better ideas for improving inventions when they\nwork with visual diagrams (Mayer 1989).\n\nOne reason externalization is so vital to substantial creative work is\nbecause of our limited capacity to consciously hold and manipulate\ninformation in our minds. It helps to offload ideas and store them in\nthe form of physical symbols and expressions in order to free up space\nfor the mind to examine those ideas at arm\u2019s length while\nentertaining new ones. Thus research shows that internal strategies\nlike mental visualization can help with relatively simple tasks, but\nfor more complex projects externalization is key (Finke et al. 1992:\n60).\n5.6 Worries and future directions\n\nWe close our survey of the cognitive science of creativity with a\nbrief discussion of some general worries about current work, and some\nprescriptions for future research.\n\nSome have worried about the validity of the psychometric measures\nemployed in neuroimaging studies. One such concern regards the\nconfidence that we should have that the tests employed are really\ntracking creative behavior. This is of course a general problem,\npartly symptomatic of the challenges that come with defining\ncreativity (like other phenomena) and with the special challenges that\nattach to features such as insight and incubation. But there are\nparticular challenges that come with using neuroimaging technologies\nsuch as fMRI scanning to attempt to study naturally occurring\nphenomena. Use of this technology is almost invariably ecologically\ninvalid\u2014one cannot run an fMRI in the artist\u2019s studio. And\nbecause of the cost and sensitivity of these imaging systems, the\ncorrelative behavioral tests are often significantly abbreviated. This\nmay impose constraints on space for occurrence of the target\nphenomena\u2014novel thinking and insight\u2014during the imaging\nsession. As one researcher worries,\n\n\nToo often single tests are used\u2014or even single items! This is\ncontrary of psychometric theory in general (where longer tests allow\nerrors to cancel themselves out and are thus more reliable) and true\nof the research on creativity assessment in particular, where\ndifferences among items and even tests are common (Richards, 1976;\nRunco, Mohamad, & Paek, 2016 [sic should be Runco, Abdulla et al.\n2016). Results from any one test will not generalize to other tests.\nResults from a single item of course have even less generalizability.\n(Runco 2017: 309\u2013310; see also Abraham 2013)\n\n\nAnother empirical researcher criticizes what he sees as \u201cthe\nwild goose chase\u201d in the neuroscience of creativity. Arne\nDietrich (2019) recapitulates the above worries about validity of\npsychometric measures and their abbreviated and piecemeal application.\nHe further worries about the now dominant emphasis on divergent\nthinking, and the default mode network (as well as the now mostly\nabandoned emphasis on notions such as madness, the right brain, and\nREM sleep). Dietrich\u2019s concern in each case is that the research\nemphasis is unhelpfully myopic, and that while the imaging methods are\nsound and state of the art, the characterization of creativity is not.\nHe decries the temptation to identify what may be a feature\nof creativity with the whole of the phenomenon. Divergent thinking, he\nsuggests, is likely a cluster of various mental phenomena rather than\na singular one, and\n\n\nthere is no effort underway to dissect divergent thinking and link it\nto the kinds of cognitive processes we use to operationalize all other\npsychological phenomena, such as working memory, cognitive control,\nsemantic memory, perceptual processes, or executive attention. (2019:\n37)\n\n\nNotice, then, that the \u201cwild goose\u201d for Dietrich is to\nhastily conclude and then center studies around a singular, special\ncreativity mechanism.\n\nDietrich also offers various prescriptions for remedy. To combat\nmyopia, he suggests (as some have in other disciplines, e.g., Boden\n2004) a plurality of types of creativity (and/or features of\ncreativity). He cautions,\n\n\nSince different types of creativity contain opposing brain\nmechanisms\u2014focused versus defocused attention, for\ninstance\u2014any all-encompassing claim about creativity in the\nbrain will almost certainly qualify as phrenology. (2019: 39)\n\n\nHe pairs this with a prescription for a more interdisciplinary\napproach to the topic. Others in the field have made the same\nprescription, advocating a \u201csystems\u201d approach sensitive\nboth to the multi-faceted nature of creativity and the value of\ntheorizing at multiple levels of explanation (Hennessy & Amabile\n2010).\n\nThese directives for future research seem hard to resist. At the very\nleast, it would seem advantageous to ensure that the full range of\nempirical method across the behavioral and brain sciences is\ncommunicated across the relevant sub-disciplines. This would ideally\nlead to better collaboration amongst such researchers. What\u2019s\ninteresting is that a cousin to this prescription is not well heeded\nby the same researchers advancing it here. However little crossover\nthere is between, say, behavioral psychologists and neuroscientists in\nstudies of creativity, there is comparatively even less crossover\n(almost none) between the psychological sciences and computational\napproaches to creativity. The next section thus begins by highlighting\nthis \u201cgap\u201d, and identifying some of the potentially\nfruitful areas for interdisciplinary work on that front. It then\ncontinues with a discussion, generally, of research on creativity in\nthe fields of computing science, artificial intelligence, and\nrobotics.\n6. Creativity and Artificial Intelligence\n\nJust as we find in psychology and neuroscience, there is a rich\nresearch literature on creativity in artificial intelligence and\ncomputer science, with devoted journals, special issues, and\nconferences (The Journal of Artificial Creativity, The\nJournal of Creative Music Systems, Digital Creativity,\nMinds and Machines special issue on Computational Creativity\n[Gerv\u00e1s et al. 2010], The International Conference on\nComputational Creativity). The question we focus on here is\nwhether a computer could be creative. As background, it is\nworth considering how theorists approached the analogous question as\nto whether a computer could think.\n\nAlthough theorists of various kinds have asked whether machines can\nthink since at least the early modern period, the most important\nconceptual innovations on the topic came from Alan Turing, centering\naround his 1950 paper \u201cComputing machinery and\nintelligence\u201d. Here Turing provided a number of groundbreaking\ninsights. Perhaps most familiar is Turing\u2019s \u201cimitation\ngame\u201d, now commonly known as \u201cthe Turing Test\u201d. In\nbrief, the test involved an unknowing interrogator who could ask an\nopen-ended series of questions of both a human and a computer. If the\ninterrogator could not distinguish computer from human, Turing\npostulated that this would suffice to illustrate genuine intelligence.\nThere is no shortage of controversy regarding the aptness of the test\nfor intelligence, and arguably no computer has yet passed it. (For\nmore thorough discussion of Turing and the Turing test see entries on\n Alan Turing,\n Turing machines, and\n the Turing test).\n\nSuccessful performance in Turing\u2019s game would require remarkable\nbehavioral flexibility. And it is highly operational: specify a\nthreshold for imitation, and then simply allow the interrogator to ask\nquestions, then assess performance. If the behavior is sufficiently\nflexible to fool the interrogator, Turing claimed, the behavior was\nintelligent and, therefore, the computer intelligent.\n\nWith this background in mind, what are some of the cases in AI\nresearch lauded as success cases, and how do they align with some of\nTuring\u2019s criteria?\n\nMany of the familiar success cases are highly specialized. Deep\nBlue defeated chess master Garry Kasparov (Kasparov &\nGreengard 2017); some language processing systems managed to navigate\nsocial contexts such as ordering from a menu at a restaurant (Schank\n& Abelson 1977); AlphaGo more recently defeated the world\nchampion Go player. This specialization is both a virtue and a\nlimitation. On the one hand, achievement in such a specialized domain\nimplies an exceptional amount of detailed memory and skill. On the\nother hand, this knowledge and skill does not generalize. Neither\nDeep Blue nor Alpha Go could successfully order from\na menu, along with countless other basic human tasks. Put in terms of\nTuring\u2019s imitation game, these systems would fail miserably to\nfool a human, or even remotely imitate one (except for their\nperformance in a very narrow domain). What about systems such as\nIBM\u2019s Watson, which famously won (against humans) on\nthe television game show Jeopardy! This performance is more\ngeneral, since topics on the show vary widely, and seemed to require\nboth language comprehension and some minimal reasoning skills (see\nentry on\n artificial intelligence\n for extended discussion). Even so, Watson\u2019s capabilities are\nstill quite limited: it cannot make fluid conversation \u201cin real\ntime\u201d and is largely insensitive to temporal and other factors\nthat come with context.\n\nThere are many, many more examples of computational systems that\ndisplay sophisticated behavior, from the highly specialized to the\nmore general. On the language processing front, very recent AI systems\nsuch as\n OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT\n and\n Google\u2019s LaMDA\n significantly outperform the systems described above. To be clear,\nthese are remarkable achievements that display substantial complexity\nand, it appears in some cases, significant flexibility\u2014features\nTuring highlighted in characteristically human behaviors. But this\nalso underscores a distinction, often invoked by critics of artificial\nintelligence research. There is a difference between a\ncomputer\u2019s displaying or merely imitating an intelligent\nbehavior, and a computer\u2019s instantiating intelligence through\nsuch behavior. And the critic will say, even if a computer behaves\nas if it is intelligent, this is just modeling or simulating\nintelligence. The greater ambition, though, is \u201cgenuine\nartificial intelligence\u201d, a system that actually\nthinks. John Searle refers to this as the distinction between\n\u201cweak AI\u201d and \u201cstrong AI\u201d, respectively.\n\n\nWeak AI: Could a computer behave as\nif it thinks?\nStrong AI: Could a computer genuinely think?\n\n\n\nThe general worry here is that however sophisticated a system\u2019s\nbehavior may appear \u201cfrom the outside\u201d, for all we know it\nmay just be a \u201chollow shell\u201d (Haugeland 1981 [1997]; Clark\n2001). The worry has then been fleshed out in various ways by\nspecifying what is missing from the shell, as it were. Here are three\nstandard such candidates. And, again, in each case however\nsophisticated the computer\u2019s behavior may appear it still may be\nlacking in any or all of the following. First, the computer may lack\nconsciousness. Second, the computer may lack any\nunderstanding of the symbols over which it computes (Searle\n1980). Finally, the computer may operate without caring about\nits own behavior or, as John Haugeland colorfully puts it, without\n\u201cgiving a damn\u201d. In each case, any kind of response from\nthe ambitious AI researcher encounters the substantial challenges that\ncome with theorizing mental phenomena such as consciousness,\nunderstanding, linguistic competence, and emotion. (Turing 1950, for\ninstance, recognized but largely eschewed these kinds of topics).\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to ask whether computers could think, and another\nto ask whether they could be creative. And just as the prospect of\nartificial intelligence or thinking divides into two\nquestions\u2014of weak AI and strong AI\u2014we may distinguish two\nanalogous questions about artificial creativity, which we\u2019ll\nrefer to as the questions of \u201cweak AC\u201d and \u201cstrong\nAC\u201d, respectively. To begin with the former:\n\n\nWeak AC: Could a computer behave as\nif it\u2019s creative?\n\n\n\nSomething behaves as if it\u2019s creative if it produces things\nwhich are psychologically new (new to that thing) and\nvaluable. Arguably, a number of computers have already done\nthat.\n\nIn the 1970s, Harold Cohen began using computational technologies to\nproduce new drawings and paintings. The work of his computer painter,\nAaron, has exhibited at galleries such as the Tate and the Victoria\nand Albert Museum in London. David Cope\u2019s \u201cEMI\u201d\n(Experiments in Musical Intelligence) has composed musical works in\nthe style of various known composers and styles, even a full-length\nopera. Some of these works have been recorded and produced by bona\nfide record labels. Just search \u201cEmily Howell\u201d on Spotify\nor Apple Music and give it a listen (Cope 1996, 2006). Simon\nColton\u2019s The Painting Fool is an ongoing project,\ninvolving a software that abstracts phrases, images, and other items\nfrom newspaper articles and creates collage-style pieces. It has also\nproduced portraits, based on images of film characters, of the same\nindividual in different emotional states (see Painting Fool\nin\n Other Internet Resources;\n see Colton 2012 for theoretical discussion). Even more recently,\nthere have been explosive developments in generative art systems like\nDALL\u2022E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, VQGAN+CLIP. (For discussion\nsee Paul & Stokes 2021). In all of these cases, the relevant\noutputs of the computer program are new relative to its past\nproductions\u2014so they are psychologically (or behaviorally) novel,\nwhich again is all the novelty that creativity requires. And although\nhistorical novelty isn\u2019t required for creativity, it\u2019s\nworth noting that these products appear to be to be new in all of\nhistory as well.\n\nWhat about value? As noted above in\n \u00a72.1,\n some theorists reject the value condition, but even if value\nis required for creativity, that too is a condition these\ncomputer artworks seem to meet. Assessments of value can be\ncontroversial, but that is no less true for the outputs of human\ncreativity. The fact that these works are critically acclaimed,\nshowcased in prestigious galleries, and commissioned by selective\nrecord labels testifies to their artistic merit, and viewers find them\npleasing, interesting, and appealing, even before being apprised of\ntheir unusual origin. So it is reasonable to conclude computer\nprograms like the ones just described exhibit at least weak AC insofar\nas they produce works of valuable novelty, and one could cite many\nmore examples in the same vein.\n\nSome theorists have noted that, whether or not the original Turing\ntest is a good test for intelligence or thinking, we might adopt an\nanalogous test for creativity: If a computer can fool human observers\ninto thinking that it is a human creator, then it is in fact creative\n(Pease & Colton 2011; see also Chen 2020 for useful discussion of\nartificial creativity, including many additional examples of\nparticular cases, and so-called Dartmouth-based Turing tests). If we\nemploy this test, we might find ourselves with an unexpected\nconclusion: computers can be creative; in fact, some of them already\nare. But one might reasonably worry that the test is inadequate and\nthe conclusion is too quick (Berrar & Schuster 2014; Bringsjord et\nal. 2001). From the fact that a computer operates as if\nit\u2019s creative, one might argue, it doesn\u2019t follow that it\nreally is. Which brings us to our next question:\n\n\nStrong AC: Could a computer genuinely be\ncreative?\n\n\n\nThis obviously returns us to the question of what conditions something\nmust meet in order to count as being genuinely creative. And here we\nneed go beyond the outwardly observable product-features of novelty\nand value to consider the underlying processes of genuine creativity.\nAs we saw in\n \u00a72.2,\n theorists have variously proposed that in order for a process to\ncount as creative, it must be surprising, original,\nspontaneous, and/or agential. There is no consensus to\nappeal to here, but if any one of these conditions is indeed\nrequired for genuine creativity, then a computer could be genuinely\ncreative only to the extent that it executes processes which satisfy\nthat condition.\n\nThe classic statement of skepticism regarding the possibility of\ncomputer creativity is due to Lady Ada Lovelace who had this to say\nwhile remarking on \u201cthe Analytical Engine\u201d designed by her\nfriend Charles Babbage:\n\n\nIt is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas\nthat might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The\nAnalytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate\nanything. (Lovelace 1843, italics added)\n\n\nThough Lovelace does not frame her comments in terms of\n\u201ccreativity\u201d as such, she explicitly denied that a\ncomputer could satisfy at least one condition that is plausibly\nrequired for creativity, namely originality. A computer\ncannot be the originator, the author, or the creator of anything new,\nshe contends; it can only do what it is programmed to do. We cannot\nget anything out of a computer that has not already been programmed\ninto it. Further, Lovelace may also be interpreted as expressing or\nimplying doubt about whether a computer could satisfy the three other\nproposed requirements for genuine creativity. Insofar as a\ncomputer\u2019s outputs cannot be original, one might also suspect\nthat they cannot be surprising. The image of a machine\nstrictly following rules invokes precisely the kind of mechanical\nprocedure that is the antithesis of spontaneity. And it may\nseem that such a machine could not be a genuine agent either.\nThe problem isn\u2019t just that a computer can\u2019t produce\nanything original; it\u2019s that it deserves no credit for whatever\nit does produce. Any praise or blame for the outputs of a computer\nrightly go to the engineers and programmers who made the machine, not\nto the machine itself. While these points may be intuitive, at least\nsome of them are being challenged by modern technologies, which have\ncome a long way since Babbage\u2019s invention.\n\nConsider AlphaGo again. This is a \u201cdeep learning\u201d system,\nwhich involves two neural networks: a Policy network and a Value\nnetwork. Very briefly: The system is trained using a vast number of\nlegitimate moves made in actual games of Go played by professional\nhuman players (28.4 million moves from 160,000 games, to be precise;\nsee Silver et al. 2016 and Halina 2021). The network is further\ntrained, again using learning algorithms, by playing many games (some\n100 million) against previous versions of itself (in the sense of a\ndifferently weighted neural network). The weights of nodes in the\nnetwork are then adjusted by a learning algorithm that favors moves\nmade in winning games. The value network is trained over a subset of\nthese many games, with node weighting adjustments resulting in\nreliable probability assignments to moves vis-\u00e0-vis their\npotential to contribute to a win. Finally, the system employs a\nMonte Carlo search tree (MCT). Generally, this kind of\nalgorithm is designed to simulate a decision process to optimize\nsuccess given chosen parameters. In this case, the search algorithm\nselects a given path of moves, then adds some valid moves to this\npath, and then if this process does not terminate (end in win/loss),\nthe system performs a \u201crollout\u201d. A rollout essentially\nplays the game out for both players (using samples of possible moves)\nto its conclusion. The information that results from the MCT and\nprocessing by the value network are then fed back (back propagated)\ninto the system. This entire process (once the system is trained) is\nrapid and determines how AlphaGo \u201cdecides\u201d to move in any\ngiven game.\n\nHere are some things to note. AlphaGo\u2019s style of play is\nsurprising. As commentators have noted, it is starkly\nunconventional relative to standards of human play (Halina cites Baker\nand Hui 2017\n [Other Internet Resources]).\n Indeed, Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player defeated by AlphaGo\nin 2016, remarked that AlphaGo\u2019s play revealed that much of\nhuman play is, contrary to prior common opinion, not creative after\nall\u2014intimating that at least some of the play of AlphaGo\nis. Note further that this system is flexible. While there\nare learning algorithms and rules that adjust network weights, the\nsystem is not mechanical or predictable in the same fashion as\nearlier, classical systems (including Deep Blue, for\nexample). In a recent paper, Marta Halina has made this argument\n(Halina 2021). She explicitly invokes Boden\u2019s characterization,\nwhich requires novelty, value, and surprise of creativity. Again, the\nnovelty and value should be plausibly attributed in this case.\nRegarding surprise, Halina suggests that it is AlphaGo\u2019s\nemployment of MCT that enables a kind of \u201cinsight\u201d,\nflexibility, and unpredictable results. She writes,\n\n\nIt is the exploration parameter that allows AlphaGo to go beyond its\ntraining, encouraging it to simulate moves outside of those\nrecommended by the policy network. As the search tree is constructed,\nthe system starts choosing moves with the highest \u201caction\nvalue\u201d to simulate, where the action value indicates how good a\nmove is based on the outcome of rollouts and value-network\nevaluations. (Halina 2021: 324)\n\n\nHalina grants that given its domain-specificity, as we have already\nnoted, this system\u2019s particular abilities do not generalize in a\nway that may be required to properly attribute genuine intelligence.\nBut she suggests that the complex use of the MCT search may amount to\n\u201cmental scenario building\u201d or, we might say, a kind of\nimagination. And insofar as this search algorithm technology can be\napplied to other systems in other domains, and imagination is a\ngeneral component of intelligence, perhaps here lies space for\ngeneralizability. AlphaGo also affords at least some reply to the\ntraditional Lovelace worry.\n\n\nArtificial systems do not act only according to preprogrammed rules\nhand-coded by engineers. Moreover, current deep-learning methods are\ncapable of producing systems that are superhuman in their abilities to\ndiscover novel and valuable solutions to problems within specific\ndomains. (Halina 2021: 327)\n\n\nIf this is right, then AlphaGo exhibits originality. Finally,\nthe flexibility with which this system operates may also satisfy\nKronfeldner\u2019s spontaneity requirement.\n\nSome of these same features are found in a related approach in AI,\nnamely research in evolutionary robotics. These systems also involve\nvarious forms of machine learning but in this case the learning is\ndistributed, as it were, across a population of individuals rather\nthan one individual. This approach can be understood, albeit\nimperfectly, as analogous to natural evolution. One begins, typically\nin computer simulation, with a population of agents. These agents are\ntypically identified with individual neural networks, the connections\nand weightings of which are random to start. Relative to some\ntask\u2014for instance, avoiding obstacles, collecting objects,\nperforming photo or phonotaxis\u2014a genetic algorithm\nassigns a fitness value to each individual agent after a certain\nperiod of time or number of trials. Fitter agents are typically\nfavored and used to generate the next population of agents. Also\nincluded in this generation are random mutation and\ngenetic crossover (digital breeding!). Although it can take\nhundreds of generations, this is a discovery approach to engineering\nor constructing a system that successfully performs a task; it is\n\u201cgradient descent learning\u201d (Clark 1996). In this\nbottom-up approach, no single individual, nor even an entire\npopulation, are in any strict sense programmed. Rather, successful\nagents have \u201clearned\u201d as a result of generations of\nrandomness, crossover, and small fitness improvements (and lots and\nlots of failures). Early success cases evolved robots that can follow\ntrails (Koza 1992), locomote in insect-fashion (Beer & Gallagher\n1992), guide themselves visually (Cliff, Husbands, & Harvey 1993),\nand collect garbage (Nolfi & Floreana 2000). See Bird and Stokes\n(2006, 2007) and Stokes and Bird (2008) for analysis and study of\ncreativity in the context of evolutionary robotics.\n\nThese systems most certainly produce novelty. Later, fit individuals\nachieve novelty at their aimed task relative to whole generations and\npopulations of previous agents. And this novelty is often surprising\nto the engineers and programmers that build them, indeed sometimes\neven unpredictably independent of any relevant task for individuals in\nthe population. There are many examples in the literature. Indeed\nLehman and others (2020) catalog a large range of cases where digital\nevolution surprises its creators, categorizing them in four\nrepresentative groups: \u201cmis-specified fitness functions\u201d,\n\u201cunintended debugging\u201d, \u201cexceeded experimenter\nexpectations\u201d, and \u201cconvergence with biology\u201d. Here\nis one now relatively famous example of the first type of case. In\nearly research in artificial life (A-Life), Karl Sims (1994) designed\nvirtual creatures that were supposed to learn to walk (as well as swim\nand jump) in a simulated environment. The fitness function assessed\nindividual agents on their average ground velocity across 10 seconds.\nSome of the fittest individuals to evolve were surprising: they grew\ntall and rigid and when they would fall over they would achieve high\nground velocity, thus maximizing fitness given the (mis)specified\nparameters in unpredicted ways.\n\nThis is but one example of how systems like these can evolve in\nunpredictable or surprising ways. This unpredictability has\noccurred not just in simulated robotics, but in embodied robotics as\nwell. In using a genetic algorithm to attempt to evolve oscillating\nsensors, researchers unintentionally evolved a radio antenna (Bird\n& Layzell 2002). This unexpected result arose from a combination\nof the particular algorithm used (which was intended) and various\nphysical features of the space such as proximity to a PC monitor\n(which the researchers had presumably deemed irrelevant but which the\nevolved system, in a sense, did not). And one might be further\ninclined to describe some of these achievements as creative (and not\njust in the trivial sense that they are original instances of robotic\nsuccess), since they also produce value, at least insofar as they are\nuseful at performing a task, whether it is locomoting or locating a\nsource of light or sensing radio waves.\n\nSome theorists in this domain might argue that these systems achieve\nspontaneity as well. Given the substantial inclusion of\nrandomness in the system\u2019s development\u2014both at the outset\nwhen the individual\u2019s neural networks are randomized and more\nimportantly with random mutation across populations\u2014it is\nintuitive to describe the system\u2019s as not following a\nmechanical procedure. Indeed, the way in which systems exploit fitness\nfunctions and data patterns further underscores this point. (Again,\nsee the rich catalog of cases offered by Lehman et al. 2020).\n\nOn the face of it, then, recent technologies in AI, evolutionary\nrobotics, and artificial life, seem to fulfill many of the conditions\nproposed for genuine creativity. These systems produce things that are\nnovel and valuable, and do so through computational processes that are\nplausibly surprising, original, and spontaneous. The one requirement\nwe have yet to address, however, is agency. Recall the\nsuggestion, implicit in Lovelace\u2019s remarks, that whatever a\ncomputer produces is to the credit of the programmer, not the\ncomputer. Notice that as sophisticated as current technologies in\nartificial creativity may be, presumably they are still not subject to\npraise or blame for what they do. If any beings are responsible for\nthe work of these programs, it still seems to be the programmers and\nengineers who make them, not the programs themselves. The programs\nthemselves do not seem to \u201cgive a damn\u201d. So, if the\ncreative process requires agency, arguably we have not yet created,\nprogrammed, or evolved a computational system that is really creative,\nhowever much they might appear to be. In the pursuit of strong AC,\nagency might be the final frontier (Paul & Stokes 2021).\n7. Conclusion\n\nIt should be clear from the above discussions that there are rich and\nlively research programs, across a range of scientific disciplines,\nstudying human creativity. These approaches substantiate the view\nthat, contrary to the romantic tradition, creativity can be explained.\nPsychological functions and neural correlates have been identified,\nand remarkable advances are being made with computational and robotics\ntechnologies. What may be less clear is that, despite these advances,\nthe distinct research programs in question are largely disjoint or\nsiloed.\n\nIn a recent paper, Geraint Wiggins and Joydeep Bhattacharya (2014)\nhighlight this \u201cgap\u201d between scientific studies of\ncreativity. Their particular emphasis is on the gaps between research\nin neuroscience and research in computer science, and they advocate a\nbridge in the form of a neurocomputational approach. This kind of\nbridging may be called for even beyond what these authors prescribe,\nsince there are gaps not just between these disciplines, but also\nbetween these and behavioral psychology, AI and A-Life research, and\nphilosophical analysis. Creativity is a deeply complex and deeply\nimportant phenomenon. Fully understanding it will require us to\nintegrate a variety of theoretical perspectives, and, as this survey\nreveals, philosophy has a vital role to play in that endeavor.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Abdulla, Ahmed M., Sue Hyeon Paek, Bonnie Cramond, and Mark A.\nRunco, 2020, \u201cProblem Finding and Creativity: A Meta-Analytic\nReview\u201d, <em>Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the\nArts</em>, 14(1): 3\u201314. doi:10.1037/aca0000194", "Abraham, Anna, 2013, \u201cThe Promises and Perils of the\nNeuroscience of Creativity\u201d, <em>Frontiers in Human\nNeuroscience</em>, 7. doi:10.3389/fnhum.2013.00246", "Albert, Robert S. and Mark A.
