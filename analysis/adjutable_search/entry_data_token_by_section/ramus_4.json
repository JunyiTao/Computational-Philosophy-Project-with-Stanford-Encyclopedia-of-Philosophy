    "main_text": "Ramist philosophy || Anti-Aristotelianism\n2.2 Anti-Aristotelianism\n\nRamus\u2019 reform program may have been designed to respond to this\nneed. He became famous for his strong reaction against\nAristotle\u2019s undisputed primacy in the medieval university\ncurriculum. According to his devoted biographer Freigius, his academic\ncareer began with a public disputation in 1536 where he defended the\nthesis \u201cthat everything Aristotle had said was false\u201d\n(quaecumque ab Aristotele dicta essent, commentitia esse). It\nis unlikely, however, that such a disputation ever took place since no\none apart from Freigius mentions it. Nevertheless, the episode was\nreferred to by many contemporaries, as well as by later historians,\nand certainly helped to associate Ramus\u2019 name with all forms of\nanti-Aristotelianism (Ong 1958: 37\u201339). Although savage attacks\non Aristotle were not uncommon during the Reformation, Ramus\u2019\ncriticism of his philosophy became one of the most famous outbursts of\nanti-Aristotelianism. Yet Ramus was hardly a typical anti-Aristotelian\nin the mold of Luther or other impassioned anti-intellectuals. Though\nmany of his followers could be considered zealots, he himself was\ninsistent on pointing out the difference between what he referred to\nas the true and the false Aristotle. Attacks on Aristotle were often\nlaunched by those who emphasized the fact that he had not been a\nChristian; some fanatics even thought that his philosophy had paved\nthe way for Satan. Ramus did not share this view. According to him, it\nwas not because Aristotle had been a pagan that he was wrong but\nrather because he had been misinterpreted by later commentators.\n\nRamus claimed that his work to reform the curriculum had begun during\nhis early schooldays. As a young student he had to endure the\ninadequate way in which Aristotle was taught; no one seemed to care if\nyoung boys could ever use what they had learnt. For Ramus, the main\nreason for reforming the curriculum was related to the usefulness of\neducation and not to the question of Aristotle\u2019s role in it. In\nfact, he emphasized the value of Aristotelian philosophy. He\nconsidered Aristotle to be the most important of logicians, though he\npointed out that Aristotle had not invented the discipline of logic\nbut rather developed what his predecessors had hinted at. Even more\nsignificant for Ramus was the need to call attention to the damage\nthat the corpus Aristotelicum had suffered after\nAristotle\u2019s death, which meant that we could not know for\ncertain what he had intended to say on any given question. Because of\nthe bad state in which Aristotle\u2019s texts were transmitted, his\ncommentators, in their discussions of individual books of the\nMetaphysics and Physics, had taken up certain issues\nthat really belonged to logic. This is also why the Organon\ngives the impression of being an amalgamation of different subjects.\nRamus laid the blame for all of this on the shoulders of the ancient\nand medieval commentators who he thought had for centuries\nmisinterpreted the Greek philosopher owing to the poor condition of\nthe Aristotelian corpus. He also highlighted another circumstance that\nhelped to explain the confusions and obscurities that, in his view,\nwere scattered throughout Aristotle\u2019s books. The Philosopher\nhimself had intentionally made his theories a little more abstruse\nthan they needed to be in order to sift the wheat from the chaff among\nhis disciples (Ramus, Scholae dialecticae, in Scholae in\nliberales artes, col. 68).\n\nTo Ramus, Aristotle was a Socratic philosopher, whose approach was\nbroadly in line with that of Cicero. By contrast, Aristotle\u2019s\nfollowers, especially those belonging to the scholastic camp, were\nmerely a bunch of frauds: \n\n\nLet us ignore all these Aristotelians and return to Aristotle, the\nauthor of such a noble discipline [i.e., philosophy], and to Cicero,\nwho tries to emulate Aristotle\u2019s teaching and to imitate him.\n(Ramus, Collectaneae praefationes, epistolae, orationes, p.\n299)\n\n",
