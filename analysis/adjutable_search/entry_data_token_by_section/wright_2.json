    "main_text": "Wright's Philosophy of Science || Induction\n2.2 Induction\n\nDespite Wright's distinguishing verification from induction, the\nlatter, nevertheless, played an important role in his philosophy of\nscience. Induction is relevant to his views of what makes for a\nrigorous science and what constitutes truth in science. Wright did not\nthink it informative to contrast intuition and induction, because they\ndo not refer to different ultimate grounds of belief (PD\n373).  Intuition is \u201crapid, instinctive judgment, whether in the\nobjective sensible perception of relatively concrete matters, or in\nthe most abstract\u201d (PD 372). Intuition is properly\ncontrasted to inference, i.e., reasoning, whether inductive or\ndeductive. \u2018Inductive,\u2019 then, refers to the a posteriori\nsource of reasoning, i.e., from evidence. It does not refer\nto a procedure for generalizing from evidence. He said, \u201cIn\ntheir primary signification and in this connection the terms\n\u2018induction\u2019 and \u2018inductive\u2019 refer directly to\nevidences, and not to any special means and processes of collating and\ninterpreting them\u201d (PD 372). So, induction may begin\nfrom a variety of sources. What philosophers, either Platonist or\nCartesian, usually call intuition he understood to be induction from\nthe data of self-consciousness.\n\n\nEven induction from sense experience is not of one type. It may\nstart with evidence taken from different levels of perceptual and\nexperiential complexity and is at work at different stages of an\ninvestigation. This approach to induction is guided by the character of\nscientific knowledge itself, which Wright understood to be the relating\nof particular facts to more general ones (PD 205\u2013206). But it\nalso follows the character of natural phenomena. In biology in\nparticular, the new science of evolution concerns the \u201cexternal\neconomy of life\u201d and thus must investigate an accumulation of\nrelated facts of observation at the level of secondary causes\n(PD 99\u2013100). Induction may come from ordinary experience,\nexperiment, or the inspections of the field naturalist. He said,\n\u201cInductions are still performed for the most part unconsciously\nand unsystematically\u2026. But when and however ideas are developed\nscience cares nothing, for it is only by subsequent tests of sensible\nexperience that ideas are admitted into the pandects of science\u201d\n(PD 47).\n\n\nFor Wright, no axioms of science can be absolute. He said:\nBut all that is really implied in the name [axiom] is that\ntruths when called axioms are used for the deductive\nproof of other truths, and that their own proof is not involved in the\nprocess. This does not deny, however, that they may be, as truths, the\nconclusions of other processes; to wit, the inductions of experience.\nIf they are, then the only ultimate truths are the particulars of\nconcrete experience, and no postulate or general assumption is inherent\nin science until its proceedings become systematic, or the truths\nalready reached give direction to further research (L\n109).\n\n\nIn this passage, axioms are not foundational in an\nepistemological sense. We seek simple principles of physical reality\nbut must be wary of taking them as foundations in the sense of\nultimate simple facts. The only ultimate in knowledge is recourse to\nthe empirical in verification. Though verification depends on\ndeduction, it does not depend on absolutely true starting points of\ndeduction to yield reliable knowledge. This part of Wright's view\nreflects his assimilation of the positivist understanding of science\nas a taxonomy of practical experience with nature. \n",
