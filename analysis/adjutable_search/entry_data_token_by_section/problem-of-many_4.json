    "main_text": "Relative Identity\n5. Relative Identity\n\nAssume that the brutalist is wrong, and that for every set of water\ndroplets, there is an object those water droplets compose. Since that\nobject looks for all the world like a cloud, we will say it is a\ncloud. The fourth solution accepts those claims, but denies that there\nare many clouds. It is true that there are many fusions of atoms, but\nthese are all the same cloud. This view adopts a position\nmost commonly associated with P. T. Geach (1980), that two things can\nbe the same F but not the same G, even though they\nare both Gs. To see the motivation for that position, and a\ndiscussion of its strengths and weaknesses, see the article on\n relative identity.\n\nHere is one objection that many have felt is telling against the\nrelative identity view: Let w be a water droplet that is\nin s1 but not s2. The relative\nidentity solution says that the droplets in\ns1 compose an object o1, and\nthe droplets in s2 compose an object\no2, and though o1 and\no2 are different fusions of water droplets, they\nare the same cloud. Call this cloud c. If\no1 is the same cloud as o2,\nthen presumably they have the same properties. But\no1 has the property of having w as a\npart, while o2 does not. Defenders of the relative\nidentity theory here deny the principle that if two objects are the\nsame F, they have the same properties. Many theorists find\nthis denial to amount to a reductio of the view.\n",
