Logic and Epistemology\n\nIn the Islamic world, representatives of falsafa largely\naccept the traditional Aristotelian presentation of the manner of the\nacquisition of knowledge. This is the Peripatetic Organon,\nwhich starts from the predicables and moves through syllogistic to\ndemonstrative science and essential definitions. Fakhr al-D\u012bn,\nhowever, presents a different structure for logic and epistemology,\nwhich leaves the traditional organization of the Organon\nbehind. The new structure revolves around two ways of acquiring\nknowledge, conceptualization (ta\u1e63awwur) and assent\n(ta\u1e63d\u012bq) (El-Rouayheb 2019: 29).\n\u201cConceptualization\u201d stands for mentally entertaining a\nconcept, such as \u201chuman\u201d or \u201crational animal\u201d,\nwithout ascribing any truth-value to it, while \u201cassent\u201d\nstands for claiming that the human is rational animal in the real\nworld (Lameer 2006). Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s reorganization of logic\nand epistemology may have been one inspiration for later authors who\nre-define the subject matter of logic as \u201cthe objects of\nconception and assent\u201d (El-Rouayheb 2012).\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn complements this picture with his critique of\ndefinitions, a rejection of the intentional acquisition of knowledge\nthrough conceptualization (Falaturi 1969, Ibrahim 2013, \u00d6zturan\n2018, Jacobsen Ben Hammed 2020, Benevich 2022a). According to the\ntraditional Aristotelian epistemology, wholly embraced by Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, we know what a human is by acquiring a complete\ndefinition of the essence of what it means to be a human, through a\ncombination of all inherent generic and specific aspects, for instance\n\u201cbeing an animal\u201d and \u201cbeing rational\u201d. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn denies that this is how we learn what things are. For him,\nas for his contemporaries Ab\u016b l-Barak\u0101t and\nal-Suhraward\u012b, the best that we can hope to achieve with the\ntraditional Aristotelian-Avicennan approach is a nominal definition,\nthe explication of a meaning we have in our minds\n(Mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al, 84; Mulakhkha\u1e63:\nMan\u1e6diq, 106). By defining humans as \u201crational\nanimals\u201d, we do not learn anything new about real humans.\nRather, we just explain what we meant by \u201chumans\u201d in the\nfirst place.\n\nFakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s main argument against real definitions is a\nreapplication of an old epistemological problem that goes back to\nMeno\u2019s paradox in Plato (Meno, 80d6\u201310).\nAl-R\u0101z\u012b formulates it as follows:\n\n\nIf one is not aware of the object of inquiry, inquiry is impossible.\nFor, if one is entirely unaware of something, the soul undertakes no\ninquiry into it. If on the other hand one is aware of it,\ninquiry is again impossible, since it is absurd to make something\navailable when it is already available (ta\u1e25\u1e63\u012bl\nal-\u1e25\u0101\u1e63il).\n\n\nIf someone says: [the inquirer] is aware of [the object of\ninquiry] in some respect or other, I respond: the respect in\nwhich he is aware of it is distinct from the respect in which he is\nnot aware of it. [82] He cannot inquire into the first [respect],\nsince it is [already] available. Nor can he inquire into the second\n[respect], since he is absolutely unaware of it\n(Mu\u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63al, 81\u201382)\n\nHow can we learn something new if we do not even know what to look\nfor; and if we already know what we are looking for, what sense does\nit make to learn something new about it? Al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 mostly accepted the Aristotelian solution to the\nparadox, namely that we can know something in one respect, and inquire\ninto it and learn something new about it in another respect (Black\n2008, Marmura 2009). Fakhr al-D\u012bn rejects this solution, on the\ngrounds that the problem may be applied to each aspect individually.\nIf we do not know one aspect but already know another aspect, new\ninquiry is impossible for both, with the two aspects falling prey to\nthe two different horns of the paradox.\n\nIn his analysis of the acquisition of knowledge, Fakhr al-D\u012bn\naddresses the traditional epistemological distinction inherited from\nkal\u0101m between \u201cnecessary\u201d\n(\u1e0dar\u016br\u012b) and \u201cacquired\u201d\n(iktis\u0101b\u012b) knowledge. We receive\n\u201cnecessary\u201d items of knowledge as a given, whether or not\nwe want to do so. For instance, when I look at a red apple, I have no\npower over seeing that the apple is red. I cannot just decide to see\nit as blue. By contrast, acquired knowledge means that we are\nintentionally involved in the acquisition of knowledge. I might for\ninstance try to learn why humans have certain features that belong to\nthem, though I need not do so (see further Abrahamov 1993, Radhi\nIbrahim 2013, Benevich 2022b). Fakhr al-D\u012bn goes against this\nstandard kal\u0101m account by denying the second type of\nknowledge. According to him, we do not have any power over our\nconceptualization of things, nor over any beliefs that derive from\nconceptualization (Arba\u02bf\u012bn, vol.1, 330\u2013332).\nRather, all items of conceptualization and assent are given to us,\nwhich in the occasionalist Ash\u02bfarite framework means given\ndirectly by God (Jacobsen Ben Hammed 2020, Benevich 2022a). We are\nthus \u201cforced\u201d to have whatever knowledge we wind up\nhaving. The nature of the objects known is not so clear: it has been\nargued that for Fakhr al-D\u012bn we can only get to objects of\nphenomenal experience (Ibrahim 2013), and also that for him we can get\nat the things in themselves (Benevich 2022a). Either way, the\nnecessary items of knowledge are the primary data for epistemic\nagents. We do not learn what humans are through an inquiry and by\nproducing essential definitions. We know what humans are through\ndirect experience, which is not up to us.\n\nFor someone who denies that we can voluntarily acquire knowledge\nthrough either conceptualization or assent, Fakhr al-D\u012bn devotes\nsurprising effort to discussing the ways of acquiring assents. He\nintroduces a few substantial innovations in the Avicennan theories of\nthe types of propositions and syllogistics. In fact, Fakhr al-D\u012bn\nintroduces several notions and distinctions that become standard in\nthe subsequent history of Arabic logic. Most of them are rooted in Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s logical apparatus, but Fakhr al-D\u012bn makes\ngreat effort to critically revise and re-organize them, creating the\nfoundations of what has been called \u201crevisionist Avicennan\nlogic\u201d (El-Rouayheb 2019: 68\u201369). One of the most\nimportant innovations is Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s suggestion that Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 failed to distinguish between the alethic and temporal\nunderstanding of necessity. \u201cEvery A is necessarily\nB\u201d does not need to mean the same as \u201cEvery\nA is always B\u201d. With this distinction, Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn creates what Street has called \u201cprofusion of\npropositional types\u201d, which would be extensively discussed in\nthe later period of Arabic logic (Street 2014, 2016; see further\nStrobino & Thom 2016).\n\nAnother important contribution in logic is Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\ndistinction between two readings of the subject term of a proposition:\nexternalist (kh\u0101rij\u012b) and essentialist\n(\u1e25aq\u012bq\u012b). When we say \u201cEvery A\nis B\u201d on the externalist reading, we mean that every\nsingle thing which actually happens to be A in the real world\nis B. On the essentialist reading, \u201cEvery A is\nB\u201d means \u201ceverything, were it to be described as\nA, would be B\u201d (Mulakhkha\u1e63:\nMan\u1e6diq, 141\u201342). The distinction between the\nexternalist and the essentialist reading is Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s\nresponse to the earlier Arabic discussions of the subject term by\nal-Far\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. Al-Far\u0101b\u012b was\ncredited with the ampliation of the subject term to the possible. In\nother words, for him, \u201cEvery A is B\u201d\nmeans \u201ceverything that is possibly A, is\nB\u201d. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 was more restrictive:\n\u201cEvery A is B\u201d means \u201ceverything\nthat is actually A, is B\u201d. This need not mean\n\u201ceverything that actually is A in the real\nworld\u201d but can also refer to whatever is actually described\nas A in the mind (Street 2005, 2010, 2014, and 2016, cf.\nChatti 2016). Fakhr al-D\u012bn\u2019s distinction between the\nessentialist and the externalist readings of the subject term may be a\nreaction to Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s ampliation of the subject term\nto include the mental realm. As we will see in\n Section 4,\n Fakhr al-D\u012bn denies mental existence, and hence requires\ndifferent formulation for the readings of the subject term that do not\nrefer to real-world actuality.\n",
