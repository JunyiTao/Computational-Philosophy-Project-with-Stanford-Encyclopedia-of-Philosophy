    "main_text": "When Gratitude is Owed\n2. When Gratitude is Owed\n\nPhilosophers debate the specific conditions under which gratitude is\ncalled for in a beneficiary\u2014that is, the conditions under which\nbeneficiary Y owes gratitude to benefactor R, and\nR deserves gratitude from Y, as a result of\nR\u2019s \u03c6-ing. This debate focuses on several features\nof Y, R, and R\u2019s \u03c6-ing.\n\nWhether R must be an agent. Most philosophers agree that at\nthe very least, benefactor R must be an agent in\norder for Y to owe gratitude to R for \u03c6-ing.\nIndeed, this is suggested by the fact that \u03c6 in the formulation of\nprepositional gratitude (Y is grateful to R for\n\u03c6-ing) paradigmatically represents an intentional verb. Two\nnotable skeptics of the \u201cagency requirement\u201d on gratitude\nare Sean McAleer (2012) and Karen Bardsley (2013). McAleer points out\nthat people sometimes purport to be grateful to inanimate objects. He\ngives the example of a prospector who finds gold on a mountain and\nthen claims to be grateful to that mountain for yielding its bounty to\nhim. The plausibility of the prospector\u2019s claim in that case need not\nimply that gratitude to inanimate objects is appropriate, however. The\nplausibility of his claim could be chalked up to his implicitly\nanthropomorphizing the \u201cbenefactor\u201d, attributing to it the\nability to give a benefit when it, strictly speaking, lacks\nthe agency to do so. Manela (2016a) argues that the prospector in\nMcAleer\u2019s example might, on reflection, be just as accurately\ndescribed as glad or appreciative that he found gold on the\nmountain. A more recent critique of the \u201cagency\nrequirement\u201d comes from Karen Bardsley (2013), who argues that\nY\u2019s gratitude can be appropriate toward something,\nR, when two conditions are met: 1) R has benefited\nY in a way Y did not deserve, and 2) that benefit\nwas not the result of an accidental or regrettable feature of\nR. Insofar as conditions 1) and 2) are sufficient for\ngratitude to be warranted, and R\u2019s being an agent is\nnot necessary for 1) and 2), R\u2019s being an agent is\nnot necessary for gratitude to be warranted. This argument, if\nsuccessful, has important implications for environmental ethics,\nbecause it implies the possibility of appropriate gratitude to\nbeneficial natural non-agents like non-sentient organisms, ecosystems,\nor the whole of nature. Manela (2018) has objected to Bardsley\u2019s\nargument by putting forward counterexamples to the claim that her\nconditions 1) and 2) are sufficient for the appropriateness of\ngratitude. If Manela is right, then 1) and 2) entail the\nappropriateness of appreciation and praise but not gratitude; and we\ncan only be appropriately grateful to natural objects that exhibit\nsome kind of agency, like dolphins.\n\nWhether \u03c6 must be an action. Among philosophers, there is\ngeneral agreement that benefactor R must act in some\nway that concerns beneficiary Y in order to deserve\nY\u2019s gratitude. Two exceptions in the literature are\nworth noting. In the first place, Saul Smilansky (1997) argues that\nY sometimes should be grateful to R for\nabstaining from harming Y, at least when certain\nconditions are met\u2014e.g., in cases when abstaining from harming\nsomeone goes beyond the call of duty, or requires effort and sacrifice\n(see the remainder of this section for a more detailed analysis of\nthose conditions). In these cases, R\u2019s \u03c6-ing, for\nwhich Y would be grateful, would be an omission or a\nrefraining rather than an act. A second exception is Kant\n(1775\u20131780 [1981]), who writes that something like gratitude is\nowed or called for in response to mere \u201cheartfelt\nbenevolence\u201d, even in the absence of any acts or attempts on the\npart of the benefactor. Kant refers to this response as\n\u201cgratefulness\u201d rather than gratitude.\n\nWhether R must have \u03c6-ed intentionally. Most philosophers\nhold that Y owes R gratitude only if R\n\u03c6-ed intentionally. Some philosophers have argued that gratitude\nis not warranted in response to all intentional acts, but only those\nthat are voluntary (Simmons 1979). On this view, if\nR benefits Y only because R has a gun to\nher head, she does not deserve Y\u2019s gratitude, even if\nshe benefited Y intentionally. Other philosophers specify\nthat in order for gratitude to be warranted, R\u2019s\n\u03c6-ing must have been intentional under the description\n\u201cbenefiting Y\u201d (Manela 2016a). On this view, if\nR \u03c6s unintentionally, or intentionally under the\ndescription \u201charming X\u201d, and thereby incidentally\nhappens to benefit Y, Y would not owe R\ngratitude for \u03c6-ing (though Y\u2019s\nappreciation for R\u2019s \u03c6-ing may be\nwarranted). This view, if correct, might have an intriguing\nimplication for children\u2019s gratitude to their parents. Some\nphilosophers have argued that to intentionally create a child does not\namount to benefiting that child, since to benefit someone is to make\nhim better off than he was before, and when one chooses to bring a\nchild into existence, there was no child there before that choice who\ncould be made better off by it. If this is true, then parents who\nintentionally bring children into existence cannot do so under the\ndescription \u201cbenefiting those children\u201d, insofar as we\ncannot intend the impossible; and if intention to benefit is necessary\nfor gratitude to be warranted, children\u2019s gratitude to their\nparents for bringing them into existence is never warranted.\nPhilosophers who hold this view (e.g., McConnell 1993) can of course\nstill hold that children owe their parents gratitude for benefits\ntheir parents conferred on their children after bringing them into\nexistence.\n\nNot all philosophers accept the \u201cintentionality\nrequirement\u201d on gratitude. Those who do not endorse it include\nBardsley (2013), for reasons mentioned earlier in this section, and\nPatrick Fitzgerald (1998), who denies that R must have\n\u03c6-ed intentionally under the description \u201cbenefiting\nY\u201d in order for gratitude to be warranted. According to\nFitzgerald, Y\u2019s gratitude to R for harming him\nmight be called for if there was some benefit that came about for\nY because of that harm. Thus it might be the case that the\nDalai Lama, Fitzgerald argues, should be grateful to the Chinese\ngovernment for persecuting him, insofar as that persecution gave him\nthe opportunity to become more virtuous. Manela (2016a) disputes this,\narguing that it is more accurate to say that the Dalai Lama should\nappreciate the opportunity the Chinese gave him by trying to\nharm him but should not be grateful to them for\n\u201cproviding\u201d it.\n\nThere is some disagreement among philosophers about whether\nR\u2019s intention to benefit Y must be\nR\u2019s only motive in \u03c6-ing. Most\nphilosophers allow that R may have other motives for\n\u03c6-ing, noting that our motives are almost always mixed (see, e.g.,\nMcConnell 1993). Some philosophers argue, however, that the presence\nof certain intentions might render a particular act of beneficence\nless than gratitude-worthy. Weiss (1985) argues that whatever her\nother motives, R must not benefit Y with the\nintention of gaining standing to demand a return in the future, as\nthis would render R\u2019s \u03c6-ing a sort of lending,\nrather than a gratitude-worthy act of beneficence. Berger (1975),\nMcConnell (1993) and Manela (2015) also argue that such an intention\nmight reduce or eliminate the amount of gratitude owed to\nR.\n\nWhether R\u2019s \u03c6-ing must be supererogatory. There is\nalso debate over whether Y can owe R gratitude for\n\u03c6-ing if R was obligated to \u03c6, or if\nY had a right to R\u2019s \u03c6-ing. Heyd\n(1982), Weiss (1985), Walker (1980\u20131981), Card (1988), and\nMacnamara (2019) all argue that Y does not owe gratitude to\nR for doing something R was already obligated to do\nanyway or that Y had a right to, and that gratitude is owed\nonly in response to supererogatory acts. Other philosophers\ndisagree, citing various counterexamples. Simmons (1979), for\ninstance, claims that I owe gratitude to a good Samaritan who stops to\noffer me assistance, even though such acts are obligatory. Lyons\n(1969) argues that while I may not owe gratitude to a lifeguard for\nsaving my life, I may owe him gratitude for having freely taken up the\nobligation to do so. Seneca (On Benefits) claims that\ngratitude may be owed for an obligatory act if the benefactor had\ngratitude-worthy motives beyond the motive to fulfill her obligation,\nand these gratitude-worthy motives were decisive in motivating her.\nBennett Helm (2019) argues that I can owe gratitude to someone who\ndutifully upholds (but does not necessarily exceed) an obligatory\nsocial norm, when his upholding that norm is \u201cnotable\u201d and\ndemonstrates recognition respect for me. Finally, it might be argued\nthat a benefactor who benefits me in fulfilling her duty deserves\ngratitude insofar as living up to her duty required extraordinary\nsacrifice on her part (McConnell 1993: 16; Seneca On\nBenefits: III.19.12\u201313), or insofar as her living up to her\nduty makes her a \u201cmoral standout\u201d among so many other\nsimilarly situated people who fail to fulfill such duties (McConnell\n2017). The captured soldier who resists torture long enough for her\ncompanions to reach safety seems to deserve gratitude, despite doing\nno more than her duty (refraining from giving the enemy valuable\ninformation). These examples suggest that perhaps \u03c6\u2019s\npraiseworthiness, rather than \u03c6\u2019s\nsupererogatoriness, is a necessary condition for Y\u2019s\nowing gratitude to R. This possibility is challenged by the\nfact that sometimes, it seems a beneficiary Y may owe\ngratitude to a benefactor who was obligated to give away some\nparticular benefit to someone, and happened to choose Y as\nthe recipient. McConnell (1993) gives the example of a student who is\nrequired by her instructor to volunteer at a charitable organization\nof her choice. When she chooses Y\u2019s organization, her\naction is neither supererogatory nor praiseworthy; but it seems she\nstill deserves gratitude from Y.\n\nWhether R must incur some liability in \u03c6-ing. Several of\nthe examples in the last paragraph suggest that gratitude is owed to\nR only if R incurred some liability in\n\u03c6-ing. On this view, gratitude is due only when the benefactor\nincurs some cost, sacrifice or risk in \u03c6-ing (Simmons 1979: 178;\nWeiss 1985: 495). Upon reflection, this condition may be too\nstringent. It would seem to rule out, for instance, the possibility of\ngratitude to an omnipotent god, who, in virtue of his omnipotence,\nwould sacrifice little or nothing in acting beneficently. It also\nseems to rule out the possibility of gratitude in McConnell\u2019s\nexample at the end of the last paragraph. In response to these\nworries, it might be pointed out that agents (perhaps even an\nomnipotent god) always incur opportunity costs in deciding to bestow\nbenefits on one beneficiary and not another.\n\nWhether R\u2019s \u03c6-ing must actually benefit R. Most\nphilosophers agree that R\u2019s \u03c6-ing need not result\nin Y\u2019s actually being benefited in order for\nR to deserve Y\u2019s gratitude. Some philosophers\nsuggest that the mere offer of a benefit, even if it is not accepted,\ncalls for gratitude in the offeree (Camenisch 1981). Others argue that\ngratitude may be called for in response to R\u2019s\nattempt at benefiting Y, even if the attempt does\nnot succeed. There is a parallel here with the conditions under which\nresentment or blame are deserved. If one agent intends, plans and\nattempts to harm another, then it seems he deserves resentment and\nblame, even if his attempts were thwarted at the last minute by\nchance. By the same token, if R intends, plans and sacrifices\nin an attempt to benefit Y, but finds her attempts thwarted\nat the last minute by chance, it seems she still deserves gratitude.\nThis claim may not be absolute. Dowling (1995), for instance, argues\nthat if R inadvertently harms Y in attempting to\nbenefit him, gratitude may not be owed. This may be true especially in\ncases where R knew, or should have known, that \u03c6-ing\nwould expose Y to non-negligible risk of harm.\n\nWhether Y wants or accepts R\u2019s \u03c6-ing. Philosophers\nalso debate whether certain features of the beneficiary are necessary\nfor gratitude to be owed. Simmons (1979), for instance, claims that\nY owes R no gratitude for benefits R forced\non Y against Y\u2019s will. Furthermore, it seems,\nY must want R\u2019s benefit in order for\ngratitude to be called for. If R delivers a benefit without\nY\u2019s desire or consent to receive it, this may betray a\ndisregard for Y\u2019s autonomy that would ultimately\nundermine R\u2019s desert of gratitude (Berger 1975;\nCamenisch 1981; Meilaender 1984: 168). This condition seems too\nstringent in cases where a beneficiary desperately needs a benefit but\nis not able to accept it, say, because of incapacitation. In response\nto such worries, Simmons adds the proviso that if Y does not\nactually want the benefit, it may suffice for gratitude to be\nowed that Y would want the benefit if certain\n\u201cimpairing conditions\u201d (such as drunkenness, mental\ndisorder or ignorance) were removed. Still, some philosophers think\ngratitude may be called for in the absence of both Y\u2019s\ndesire and such impairing conditions. McConnell (1993), for instance,\nargues that a child who accepts an offer of college tuition from a\nbenefactor owes that benefactor gratitude, even if she does not want\nto go to college.\n\nSimmons (1979) argues for a further necessary condition for\nY\u2019s owing gratitude to R: that Y must\nnot want the benefit in question not to come from R.\nY may not want his once-abusive father to pay for his college\neducation, for example, in which case Y would not owe his\nfather gratitude for doing so, even if Y might have been\nhappy to accept the same benefit from anyone else. McConnell (1993)\nand Weiss (1985) disagree, arguing that while it may sometimes be\nemotionally difficult for a beneficiary to be grateful to a particular\nbenefactor for \u03c6-ing, beneficiaries might still owe their\nbenefactors gratitude under such circumstances (especially if the\nbeneficiary accepts the benefit).\n\nTwo remarks about the role of these conditions. In\nconsidering the conditions under which beneficiary Y owes\ngratitude to benefactor R for \u03c6-ing, two points should be\nnoted. The first is that the question of whether gratitude is owed is\nnot necessarily settled once and for all in the moment that R\n\u03c6\u2019s. Even if R\u2019s \u03c6-ing makes it the case\nthat Y owes R gratitude, some future harm or wrong\non R\u2019s part might render Y\u2019s gratitude\nfor R\u2019s \u03c6-ing no longer called for (McConnell 1993:\n29\u201330). This might happen if, for example, R recklessly\nor malevolently destroys a gift she gave Y. Gratitude may\nalso cease to be called for if R, subsequent to\ngratitude-worthily \u03c6-ing, demands a return or compensation for\nhaving \u03c6-ed (insofar as such a demand would seem to render\nR\u2019s \u03c6-ing more of a loan than a gratitude-worthy\nact of benevolence or beneficence) (Weiss 1985), or tries to use the\nfact of his having \u03c6-ed to manipulate Y by guilting him\ninto doing something (Berger 1975). \n\nA second point worth noting is that while these conditions are often\ndiscussed as necessary (and perhaps jointly sufficient) conditions for\ngratitude\u2019s being called for, they can also be seen as factors\nthat modulate how much and what sort of gratitude is owed.\nThe proper response to mere \u201cheartfelt benevolence\u201d on\nR\u2019s part might be no more than a similar feeling of\ngoodwill from Y to R. On the other hand, if\nR sacrifices greatly in voluntarily and successfully\nconveying substantial and much-needed benefit on Y, the\ngratitude Y owes R may take the form of a strong\nintention or willingness to sacrifice to a similar degree if\nR ever finds herself in need.\n",
