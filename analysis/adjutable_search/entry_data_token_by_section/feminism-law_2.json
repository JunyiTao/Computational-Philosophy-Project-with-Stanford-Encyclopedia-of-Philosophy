    "main_text": "Fundamental Themes in Feminist Legal Philosophy || Equality and Difference\n1.2 Equality and Difference\n\nA central task of feminist philosophy of law is articulating what\nequality requires against this background of patriarchy; however,\nfeminists take differing approaches to this problem. For liberal\nfeminists, a primary task is achieving the principle of procedural\nequality articulated by Aristotle that like cases should be treated\nalike and different cases differently in proportion to their\ndifferences. For other feminists, this focus on procedural justice\nraises the question of whether there are differences between men and\nwomen that the law may justifiably take into account. For many\ncenturies men and women have been viewed as significantly different,\nand since they are different it has been thought appropriate and\njustified to treat them differently in law. Indeed, one of the reasons\nfor the entrenchment of sexual inequality is precisely the observation\nthat some differences between men and women are real: only women can\nbecome pregnant and bear children. Historically, feminists contend in\na variety of ways, such differences were greatly exaggerated, as was\ntheir significance and the extent to which they could be attributed to\nbiology rather than being socially constructed.\n\nFor feminist philosophers of law, an ongoing set of issues has\nconcerned which differences, if any, law may take into account\nconsistently with equal treatment. There are biological differences,\nsuch as pregnancy and birth. There are statistical differences: \nmen are taller and stronger; women have longer life expectancies.\nThere are historical differences:  women but not men have been\nsystematically subordinated because of their sex\u2014unable to vote,\nto own property, or to enter into legal contracts. Women are much more\nat risk to be raped. Women are much more likely to be responsible for\ncaregiving in the family. Women are likely to earn less for the same\nwork, and likely to be segregated in jobs that pay less than work that\nis male dominated. The feminist challenge is whether and how to\nacknowledge certain differences without entrenching stereotypes,\nreinforcing detrimental customs, promoting sexist socialization, or\nincurring backlash (Rhode 1997; Minow 1991)\u2014and without\ncompromising equality.\n\nThis challenge identifies \u201cdilemmas of difference\u201d (Minow\n1991), which occur when a decision is based on unstated norms that\npresume the status quo as universal and inevitable when in fact these\nnorms reflect a particular point of view. The structure of a\ndifference dilemma is this:  there is a difference, such as that\nonly women become pregnant or that an employer has a history of\nrefusing to promote women. Taking this difference into account seems\nrequired for equal treatment: otherwise, women will face disadvantages\nthat men will not. But taking this difference into account also seems\nto instantiate unequal treatment, giving women special benefits (time\noff work, fast-track promotions) men do not have. So it seems there is\nno way to achieve equality in the face of differences such as\nthese.\n\nCountering a difference dilemma requires undermining the way the issue\nwas initially formulated (more accurately, mal-formulated). \nFeminist critics of the view that pregnancy leave is a special\nbenefit, for example, point out that the only way these benefits can\nbe judged special is if the norm against which they are being\nevaluated is male. If the standard was female, or even human, such\nbenefits could not be considered special (or even unusual) since they\nare far more commonly needed than, say, benefits for a broken leg, or\nprostate cancer (neither of which are considered special benefits).\nThe underlying male standard is invisible because it is traditional\nfor most workplaces, and pregnancy leave would require a change to\nthese norms; but in the view of feminist critics, this underlying\nstandard needs to be exposed as male because in fact it is not equal.\n(Rhode 1997; Minow 1991)  Once male norms are recognized as only\nthat\u2014male norms\u2014the presumption of difference must be\ncorrected. If the need for correction is taken seriously, then legal\nrecognition of difference cannot by itself imply unequal treatment. An\nassertion of difference is a factual assessment. Equality is a\npolitical (or moral) standard. One does not automatically follow from\nthe other. Thus formulation of the debate in terms of sameness or\ndifference must be transcended by understanding equality. (Smith 2005;\nRhode 1997; Minow 1991).\n",
