    "main_text": "Arguments for Closed Borders || Political Self-Determination\n1.6 Political Self-Determination\n\n\nAnother account of a country\u2019s right to close its borders\nalleges that this right is merely one component of a state\u2019s more\ngeneral right to political self-determination (Walzer 1983; Pevnick 2011).\nSpecifically, some contend that a legitimate state\u2019s right\nto freedom of association entitles it to choose whether or not to admit\nany given immigrants (Wellman 2008). This type of argument\ninvolves three basic premises (1) legitimate states have a right to\npolitical self-determination, (2) freedom of association is an\nessential component of self-determination, and (3) freedom of\nassociation entitles one to refuse to associate with others.\nThus, just as we would consider it an egregious violation of an\nindividual\u2019s personal self-determination if she had no choice but\nto marry the suitor of her father\u2019s choice, for instance, we\nshould recognize that no political community is fully self-determining\nunless it has discretion over which potential immigrants to invite into\nits political community. According to this line of argument,\nthen, there is nothing mysterious or complicated about a\ncountry\u2019s right to screen applicants for admission: it is\nmerely a standard component of a state\u2019s more general right to\nself-determination.\n\n\nThere are a number of ways in which one might contest this line of\nargument (Fine 2010; Wellman and Cole 2011). Most obviously, one might\nquestion whether corporate political entities are even eligible for\nmoral rights.  Value-individualists, for instance, contend that only\nindividual persons ultimately matter morally, and thus, while\npolitical states may be extremely valuable instruments, they are\nmerely instruments and, as such, are not the type of entities to which\nwe can sensibly ascribe moral rights. Secondly, even if countries can\nsomehow qualify for moral rights, it seems far-fetched to liken a\ncountry\u2019s freedom of association with respect to immigrants to an\nindividual\u2019s right to refuse a marriage proposal, since presumably\nmarital freedom of association is incalculably more important to an\nindividual than her right to exclude potential compatriots. What is\nmore, it is not clear that the analogy between personal and political\nfreedom of association is even apt, because states that deny\nimmigrants do not merely refuse to politically associate with those\nwho seek to migrate, they also forcibly exclude them from the state\u2019s\nterritory.  Finally, even if all of these concerns could somehow be\naddressed, notice both that this argument purports to establish only\nthat legitimate states have a presumptive right to\nexclude outsiders. Both of these qualifications are important. The\ncondition that only legitimate states are morally entitled to be\nself-determining is significant because, given the plausible\nassumption that many existing states are illegitimate, this argument\nwould not justify the immigration policies of many current states. And\nthe fact that this argument would at best ground only a presumptive\nright to exclude outsiders is noteworthy, because it leaves open the\npossibility that this right could be over-ridden by the weightier\nrights various foreigners may have to be admitted. If a refugee needs\nto gain entrance in order to escape persecution or a child needs to be\nadmitted in order to reunite with her mother, for instance, then\ndefenders of political self-determination cannot antecedently assume\nthat the legitimate state\u2019s right to freedom of association\nnecessarily trumps these individuals\u2019 claims.\n",
