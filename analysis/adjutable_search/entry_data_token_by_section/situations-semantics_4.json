    "main_text": "Situation variables or unarticulated constituents?\n5. Situation variables or unarticulated constituents?\n\nAn important question in situation semantics is how exactly situations\nenter the semantic interpretation process. Are they articulated via\nsyntactically represented variables, or are they \u201cunarticulated\nconstituents\u201d (Perry 1986, R\u00e9canati 2002), possibly mere\nindices of evaluation? The issue is well explored for times and\npossible worlds (see the entry on\n ontological commitment).\n Kripke\u2019s semantics for modal logic allows quantification over\npossible worlds only in the metalanguage (see the entry\n modal logic),\n for example. Likewise, in Prior\u2019s tense logic (see the entry\n Arthur Prior),\n quantification over times is confined to the metalanguage (see the\nentry\n time).\n\n(22)\n\n\na.\n[[must \u03b1]]w = 1 iff\n[[\u03b1]]w\u2032 = 1 for all w\u2032\nthat are accessible from w.\nb.\n[[past \u03b1]]t = 1 iff\n[[\u03b1]]t\u2032 = 1 for some t\u2032\nthat precedes t.\n \n\n\nMontague\u2019s language of intensional logic (Montague 1974) was\ndeveloped in the tradition of Kripke and Prior, and does not have\nvariables ranging over times or worlds: tense and modal operators\nshift evaluation indices, as illustrated in (22), but do not bind\nvariables in the object language. Quantification over worlds and times\nis treated differently from quantification over individuals, then. The\ndistinction was made deliberately because it predicts differences that\nwere thought correct at the time. Once an evaluation index is shifted,\nit is gone for good, and can no longer be used for the evaluation of\nother expressions. This constrains temporal and modal anaphora. Until\nthe early seventies anaphoric reference to times and worlds in natural\nlanguages was believed to be constrained in precisely the way\npredicted by the evaluation index approach. The belief was challenged\nby work on temporal anaphora (Kamp 1971, Partee 1973, Vlach 1973, van\nBenthem 1977), however. Cresswell 1990 presented parallel arguments\nfor modal anaphora, and showed more generally that natural languages\nhave the full expressive power of object language quantification over\nworlds and times. Quantification over worlds or times is thus no\ndifferent from quantification over individuals, and should be\naccounted for in the same way.\n\nExact analogues of Cresswell\u2019s examples can be constructed to\nshow that natural languages have the full expressive power of object\nlanguage quantification over situations. Here is a first taste of the\nkind of example we have to look at.\n\n(23)\nIf, whenever it snowed, it had snowed much more than it actually\ndid, the town plow would have removed the snow for us.\n\n\nSuppose (23) is uttered to make a claim about the town of Amherst\nduring the last 20 years. We are looking at the snowfalls during the\nrelevant period. For each of those actual snowfalls s, we are\nconsidering counterfactual situations r where it snowed much\nmore than it did in s. The claim is that each of those\ncounterfactual situations is part of a situation where the town plow\nremoved the snow for us. To formalize what was said, we have to be\nable to consider for each actual snowfall s a set of\ncounterfactual alternatives and compare the amount of snow in each of\nthem to the actual amount of snow in s. This means that we\nhave to be able to \u201cgo back\u201d to the actual snowfall\nsituations after considering corresponding counterfactual situations.\nTo do so we have to keep track of the original situations. The\navailable bookkeeping tools are either evaluation indices, or else\nsituation variables and binding relations in the object language. If\nwe want to avoid possibly unpronounced situation variables, we need\ntwo shiftable evaluation indices for (23). In the long run, even two\nindices wouldn\u2019t be enough, though. Here is an example that\nrequires three:\n\n(24)\nWhenever it snowed, some local person dreamed that it snowed more\nthan it actually did, and that the local weather channel erroneously\nreported that it had snowed less, but still more than it snowed in\nreality.\n\n\nIt is not hard to see that we can complicate such examples\nindefinitely, and that there would be no end to the number of\nevaluation indices needed. But that suggests that natural languages\nhave the full power of object language quantification over situations.\nQuantification over situations is no different from quantification\nover individuals, then, as far as expressive power is concerned. Since\nnatural languages have syntactically represented individual variables\nand it would be surprising if they used two different equally powerful\nquantification mechanisms, it seems to be at least a good bet that\nthere are syntactically represented situation variables in natural\nlanguages (but see Cresswell 1990 and Jacobson 1999 for dissenting\nopinions). But then the situations quantified over or referred to in\n(23), (24) and their kin do not necessarily correspond to\n\u201cunarticulated constituents\u201d. They are syntactically\nrepresented, even though they might happen to be unpronounced. The\nsyntactic representation of situation variables is investigated in\nPercus 2000, Keshet (2008, 2010), and F. Schwarz (2008, 2012).\n",
