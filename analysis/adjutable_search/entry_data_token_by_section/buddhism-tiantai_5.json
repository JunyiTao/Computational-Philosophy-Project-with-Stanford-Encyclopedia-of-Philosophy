This is a way of further specifying the relation\nbetween local coherence and global incoherence, which are not only\nsynonymous, but also irrevocably opposed, and indeed identical only by\nmeans of their opposition and mutual exclusivity. Provisional truth is\nthe antecedent, the premise, and indeed in a distinctive sense the\ncause of ultimate truth, but only because it is the strict\nexclusion of ultimate truth.\n",
