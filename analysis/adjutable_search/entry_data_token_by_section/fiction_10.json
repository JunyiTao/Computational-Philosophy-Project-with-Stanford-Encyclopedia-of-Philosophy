    "main_text": "Truth in Fiction || Truth in Fiction as Make-Believe Truth\n2.2 Truth in Fiction as Make-Believe Truth\n\nWalton\u2019s account of truth in fiction rests on his distinctive\naccount of a work of fiction as a prop in a game of make-believe,\nwhere the function of the prop is to prescribe imaginings. Unlike\nLewis, he doesn\u2019t place stress on the idea that fictional\nstatements are implicitly prefixed with an in-the-fiction operator. For Walton, a proposition is\nfictional\u2014true in the fiction\u2014just in case participants in\nsuch a game of make-believe are supposed to imagine it as true (Walton\n1990; for some recent reservations about this account, see Walton\n2013, 2015). There are two types of fictional truth: the\nprimary fictional truths are evident in the work itself,\nwhile the implied fictional truths are generated from the\nprimary ones. The problem of how to generate implied fictional truths\nfrom primary fictional truths is essentially the problem that Lewis\nfaced, and the principles that Walton describes\u2014the Reality\nPrinciple and the Mutual Belief Principle\u2014are close to Analysis\n 1\n and\n 2,\n but without the commitment to the machinery of possible worlds.\nLetting \\(p_1\\)\u2026 \\(p_n\\) be the primary fictional truths of\nfiction F, the Reality Principle holds that it is true in\nF that q iff had \\(p_1\\)\u2026 \\(p_n\\) been the case,\nq would have been the case, while the Mutual Belief Principle\nholds that it is true in F that q iff the following was\nmutually and openly believed in the society from which F\noriginated: had \\(p_1\\)\u2026 \\(p_n\\) been the case, q would\nhave been the case. \n\nWalton acknowledges that each principle has counterintuitive\nconsequences (see Walton 1990: ch. 4 on the contrast and interplay\nbetween the two principles). Lewis himself noted this in the case of\nthe Reality Principle, but as we remarked above the same seems true of\nthe Mutual Belief Principle. In addition, neither principle seems able\nto handle cases in which genre conventions generate fictional truths.\nConsider an otherwise typical zombie story that never explicitly says\nthat zombies move by stumbling forward rather than by running\n(Woodward 2011: 163). Because this way of moving is a conventional\nfeature of zombies in the zombie story genre, it will be true in the\nstory that zombies don\u2019t run, even though the question \u201cDo\nzombies run?\u201d is probably not answerable by appeal to either\nprinciple (Woodward 2011: 163; Lewis 1978 [1983: 274]; Walton 1990:\n161\u20139). Walton himself thinks that the moral to be drawn from\nsuch difficulties is that these principles are no more than rules of\nthumb, and that there is no single, general principle that governs the\npractice of critics and appreciators of fiction (1990: 139). A rather\ndifferent approach to these problems is taken by Stacie Friend, who\nargues that problems ensue if we insist on principles, taken\nas ways of inferring implied fictional truths from primary fictional\ntruths. Instead of defending the Reality Principle, she\ndefends what she calls the Reality Assumption, the thesis\nthat everything that is really true is also fictionally the case,\nunless it is excluded by the work (Friend 2017).\n\nThere is a further concern about the apparatus Walton employs, one\nthat also affects Lewis\u2019s account. To apply the above rules of\ngeneration, we need to be able to determine a work\u2019s\nprimary fictional truths, those that are evident in the work\nor, in Lewis\u2019s terms, those that are part of what is told as\n\u201cknown fact\u201d. These present no trouble if we have a\nreliable narrator, but what if the narrator is unreliable? With Lewis\nas his focus, Currie imagines a situation in which the Holmes stories\nare written in a \u201ctone of understatement and irony\u201d, so\nthat Holmes appears only somewhat successful even though in the story\nhe is \u201cspectacularly successful\u201d (Currie 1990: 70). Given\nthat the worlds to be considered are worlds in which the story is told\nas known fact, the worry is that, for Lewis, Holmes is only somewhat\nsuccessful in the stories. Walton\u2019s answer to this kind of\nproblem is to allow free rein to the kind of pragmatic interpretive\nmoves that are used in ordinary communicative exchanges (see Walton\n1990: ch. 4). If there is evidence of understatement and irony, we\nshould make allowances for that when determining what is true. Lewis\nhas a broadly similar answer. In a footnote Lewis points out that\nthere are all kinds of ways of telling stories. Storytellers may\npresent themselves as quite unreliable (mad, na\u00efve, etc.), or as\ntranslators of some work rather than the person who wrote it, and so\non. He adds that \n\n\nin these exceptional cases also, the thing to do is to consider those\nworlds where the act of story-telling really is whatever it purports\nto be\u2014ravings, reliable translation of a reliable source, or\nwhatever\u2014at our world. (Lewis 1978 [1983: 266 fn. 7]) \n\n\nHence if the author pretends to be recounting a true story in a tone\nof understatement and irony, then the worlds of the story are those\nworlds in which the teller really does tell a true story in a tone of\nunderstatement and irony, not worlds where his actual words are to be\ntaken literally (cf. Hanley 2004).\n",
