As we saw above, Leibniz\nbelieves that the mind will act according to its laws and the body\naccording to its laws and the two will be in harmony. But Leibniz also\nbelieves that the mind or soul operates for particular ends and that\ntherefore its actions are explicable in terms of final causes,\nwhereas the actions of the body, purely instances of matter in motion\naccording to the claims of the mechanical philosophy, are to be\nexplained in terms of efficient causes. As he puts it in the\nMonadology \u00a7\u00a779 and 81,\n\n\nSouls act according to the laws of final causes, through\nappetitions, ends, and means. Bodies act according to the laws of\nefficient causes or of motions. And these two kingdoms, that of\nefficient causes and that of final causes, are in harmony with each\nother.\n\n\nAccording to this system, bodies act as if there were no souls\n(though this is impossible); and souls act as if there were no bodies;\nand both act as if each influenced the other. (G VI 620\u201321/AG 223)\n\n\n\nIn the realm of natural philosophy, Leibniz will say clearly that\n\u201call corporeal phenomena can be derived from efficient and\nmechanical causes,\u201d though there are final causes (or\n\u201chigher reasons\u201d) that underlie them. (See Specimen\nDynamicum: GM VI 242/AG 126) But Leibniz pushes the parallelism\neven further:\n\n\nIn general, we must hold that everything in the world can be\nexplained in two ways: through the kingdom of power, that is,\nthrough efficient causes, and through the kingdom of\nwisdom, that is, through final causes, through God,\ngoverning bodies for his glory, like an architect, governing them as\nmachines that follow the laws of size or mathematics,\ngoverning them, indeed, for the use of souls, and through God governing\nfor his glory souls capable of wisdom, governing them as his fellow\ncitizens, members with him of a certain society, governing them like a\nprince, indeed like a father, through laws of goodness or\nmoral laws. (GM VI 243/AG 126) \n\n\nThough Leibniz speaks here of the kingdoms of power and wisdom, the\ntwo-tiered explanatory approach \u2013 the phenomena of the natural\nworld explained through efficient causes and the actions of the mind\nexplained through final causes \u2013 leads to the distinction between\nwhat he more commonly calls the kingdom of nature and the kingdom of\ngrace. (See Monadology \u00a787) Thus, on Leibniz's\nview, we can understand the world as if designed by God, the perfect\nengineer or architect, and we can also understand the world as if\nordered and guided by God, the supreme monarch, who is concerned solely\nwith the happiness of his subjects.\n",
