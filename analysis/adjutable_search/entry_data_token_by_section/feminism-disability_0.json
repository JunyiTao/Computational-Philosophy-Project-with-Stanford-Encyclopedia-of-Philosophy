    "main_text": "Disability Studies and the Philosophy of Disability\n1. Disability Studies and the Philosophy of Disability\n\n\nDisability studies has steadily gained prominence over the past half\ncentury, moving expeditiously (at least in the United States) into the mainstream in\nhistorical and literary scholarship, but not so quickly in philosophy. In\nthe former fields, the components of disability studies are (mainly)\ntwo. There are analyses of the real histories of individuals or\ngroups of individuals with disabilities, and there also are readings of\nrepresentations of disabled people as they appear in literature,\ncinema, and similar creative work. Integrated with the accounts of real\nor invented disabled people are interpretations of the social or\ncultural forces that shaped their lives (in the case of actual\nindividuals with disabilities), or else that shaped their\nrepresentations in texts, film, and similar symbolic media.\n\n\nConducting disability studies in these disciplines has to a large\ndegree been a matter of applying well-known interpretive techniques to\nsubjects whom historical and literary scholarship previously\nignored. Thus, for example, most historical scholarship about\ndisability has aimed at reporting about the marginalized lives of\nindividuals with physical, cognitive, or psychological impairments.\nHistorical accounts of how such individuals fared in a particular\nsociety and a particular era are informed by familiar theories about\nthe political function of social roles, applied to the status to which\ndisabled people in that historical period were assigned. (To sample a\ndisability studies approach to intellectual history, see Kudlick and\nLongmore 2006, on how disability shaped Habermas's philosophy.)\nSimilarly, studies of symbolic presentations of disability mostly\ninterpret representations (either fictional or biographical) of\nindividuals whose characterization is inflected by attribution of one\nor another impairment. Scholarship about what such representations mean\nin a particular creative work usually is propelled by one or another\nfamiliar theory about the aesthetic, psychological, political or other\nfunction of symbolic roles, applied to disabled characters and\ncharacterizations of their disabilities. (See Silvers 2000 for a\ndiscussion of literary theory in disability studies.)\n\n\nIn these disciplines and related ones, consequently, engaging with\ndisability has involved invoking mainstream theoretical\npresuppositions and principles to explore phenomena associated with\ncertain previously under-theorized or otherwise ignored groups. Not so\nin philosophy, however, where disability, deformity and illness have\nappeared to defy application of familiar theoretical presumptions and\npractices. Examples of the resistance of disability to being subsumed\nunder philosophical theories turn up throughout the discipline's\nhistory, from Plato's uncharacteristic emphasis on fleshly ideals in\nsettling the fate of infants with deformities (Garland 1995, 15) to\nHume's setting aside the testimony of individuals with illnesses as\npertinent to theories of perception (Hume 1757) to Rawls's declaration\nthat justice for disability is a detour that cannot be addressed when\nbasic principles of justice are formulated and therefore must wait for\nthe later, legislative stage.\n(See Sen 2004 for an analysis of how Rawls's theory fails to\nrespond to the facts of disability, but see also Becker 2005.)\n\n\nFeminist philosophy, with its methodological reluctance to adopt\nphilosophy's traditional presuppositions without scrutinizing\nthem, initially was the most prominent area within the discipline where\ndisability is taken to be a serious subject for philosophical\ninvestigation. According philosophical significance to the state\nof being disabled is one of the innovations feminist theory has\nintroduced into philosophy. This article therefore explores affinities\nbetween feminist philosophy, which is aimed at expanding philosophical\ninquiry so that it adequately addresses women and their perspectives,\nand philosophical work with similar aspirations in regard to people\nwith disabilities.\n\n\nIn some respects, disability presents the instances or issues that\nmost intensely and interestingly challenge those traditional\nphilosophical presuppositions and principles against which feminist\nthought has been inclined to protest. Nevertheless,\nfeminist interests do not always coincide with disability perspectives,\nand unresolved tensions between feminist philosophy and the philosophy\nof disability remain. Consequently, this article also explores\ndisability perspectives on feminist philosophy as much as it reports\nfeminist perspectives on disability.\n",
