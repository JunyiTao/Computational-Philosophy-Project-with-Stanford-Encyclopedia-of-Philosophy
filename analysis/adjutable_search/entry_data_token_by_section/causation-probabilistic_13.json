    "main_text": "Probability-raising Theories of Causation || Contextual-unanimity\n2.6 Contextual-unanimity\n\nAccording to both\n Cart\n and\n Eells,\n a cause must raise the probability of its effect in every\nbackground context. This has been called the requirement of\ncontextual-unanimity. Dupr\u00e9 (1984) raises the following\ncounterexample to the contextual unanimity requirement. Suppose that\nthere is a very rare gene that has the following effect: those that\npossess the gene have their chances of contracting lung cancer\nlowered when they smoke. In this scenario, there would be a\nbackground context in which smoking lowers the probability of lung\ncancer: thus smoking would not be a cause of lung cancer according to\nthe contextual-unanimity requirement. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely\nthat the discovery of such a gene would lead us to abandon the claim\nthat smoking causes lung cancer. \n\nDupr\u00e9 suggests instead that we should deem C to be a cause of\nE if it raises the probability of E in a \u2018fair\nsample\u2019\u2014a sample that is representative of the population\nas a whole. Mathematically, this amounts to the requirement that\n\n\n(Dupr\u00e9)\nC causes\nE if and only if\n\n \\[\\Sigma_B \\PP(E \\mid C \\amp B) \\times \\PP(B) \\gt \\Sigma_B \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C \\amp B) \\times \\PP(B)\\]\n\n\n\nwhere B ranges over the relevant background contexts. This is\nthe same as requiring that C must raise the probability of\nE in a weighted average of background contexts, where\neach background context is weighted by the product of \\(\\PP(B)\\) and\nthe absolute value of \n\n \\[\\PP(E \\mid C \\amp B) - \\PP(E \\mid {\\nsim}C \\amp B).\\]\n\n\nDupr\u00e9\u2019s account surely comes closer to capturing our ordinary\nuse of causal language. Indeed, the inequality in\n Dupr\u00e9\n is what one looks for in randomized trials. If one randomly\ndetermines which members of a population receive a treatment\n(C) and which do not \\(({\\nsim}C)\\), then the distribution of\nbackground conditions B ought to be the same in both groups,\nand ought to reflect the frequency of these conditions in the\npopulation. Thus we would expect the frequency of E to be\nhigher in the treatment group just in case inequality Dupr\u00e9\nholds. \n\nOn the other hand, Eells\u2019s population-relative formulation allows\nus to make more precise causal claims: in the population as a whole,\nsmoking is a mixed cause of lung cancer; in the sub-population of\nindividuals who lack the protective gene, smoking is a positive cause\nof lung cancer; in the sub-population consisting of individuals who\npossess the gene, smoking is a negative cause of lung cancer.\n\nIn any event, this debate does not really seem to be about the\nmetaphysics of causation. As we saw in the previous section, causal\nrelevance is really the basic metaphysical concept. The dispute\nbetween Dupr\u00e9 and Eells is really a debate about how best to use the\nword \u2018cause\u2019 to pick out a particular species of causal\nrelevance. Dupr\u00e9\u2019s proposed usage will count as (positive)\ncauses many things that will be mixed causes in Eells\u2019s proposed\nusage. But there does not seem to be any underlying disagreement about\nwhich factors are causally relevant. (For defense of a similar\nposition, see Twardy and Korb 2004.)\n",
