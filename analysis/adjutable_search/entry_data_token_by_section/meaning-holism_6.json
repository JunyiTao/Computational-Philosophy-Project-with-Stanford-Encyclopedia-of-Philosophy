    "main_text": "Problems for Meaning Holism || \u201cAnalyticity\u201d and Objectivity\n3.3 \u201cAnalyticity\u201d and Objectivity\n\nA final group of objections to meaning holism stem from the assumption\nthat theories that tie what we mean by a term to some of the beliefs\nor inferences associated with it can seem to make the all of the\nmeaning-constitutive beliefs or inferences \u201ctrue in virtue of\nmeaning\u201d, and thus in a sense \u201canalytically\n true\u201d.[28]\n The meaning molecularist\u2019s claim that their proposed\nmeaning-constitutive inferences need to be valid (say, if the meaning\nof \u201c&\u201d were identified with its elimination and\nintroduction rules, then one would need to treat \u201c\\((A \\ \\&\\\nB) \\rightarrow A\\)\u201d as true in virtue of meaning) isn\u2019t\nentirely uncontroversial, but the assumption that meaning-constitutive\ninferences will be valid isn\u2019t taken to be problematic even by\nthe critics of meaning molecularism (who argue instead that particular\ncandidates for meaning constitutive inferences can\u2019t be\naccepted, since we can coherently doubt their validity (Burge 1986;\nWilliamson 2003)). However, while the meaning molecularist can at\nleast allow that we can make many mistakes, since most of our beliefs\nare not meaning constitutive, the meaning holist may seem to be\ncommitted to all of our beliefs being true, since all of them\ndetermine what we\n mean.[29]\n The issue isn\u2019t so much that all such beliefs are true\n\u201cin virtue of meaning\u201d, but rather that they are all\ntreated by the meaning holist as simply true at all. Whether\nthe truth involved is analytic or not, it doesn\u2019t seem like we\nshould have to treat all of any speaker\u2019s beliefs as\ntrue. There are a number of responses to this worry, all of which\nappeal to strategies already canvassed in describing the meaning\nholist\u2019s response to worries about instability.\n\nFor instance, one way to cut worries about objectivity short is to\nappeal to the narrow/wide content distinction discussed in\n 3.2.2,\n and claim that the meanings for which meaning holism holds are not\nthe sort that relate to truth.  Block, in particular, has\ninsisted that, since the contents for which meaning holism holds\ninvolve narrow meanings, the question of their truth\ndoesn\u2019t come up. The \u201cnarrow analog\u201d of analyticity\ndoesn\u2019t produce analyticity in the traditional sense, and thus\nBlock can reject what he calls \u201cThe Plausible Sounding\nPrinciple\u201d, namely:\n\n\nInferences that are part of inferential roles must be regarded by the\ninferential role theorist as analytic. For these inferences are what\nare taken to constitute meaning, and inferences that constitute\nmeaning are analytic. (Block 1993: 51)\n\n\nSince \u201cdeterminate meaning facts about narrow meaning\ndo not engender analyticities\u201d (Block 1993: 54), the analyticity\nworry won\u2019t plague this sort of holist. Since narrow contents\nhave no truth values, \u201cand hence have no truth\nconditions\u201d, they simply aren\u2019t the type of thing that\ncould be true in virtue of meaning, and thus \u201caren\u2019t even\nthe sort of things that can be analytic\u201d (Block 1993:\n61).\n\nAnother way for the meaning holist to mitigate worries about\nobjectivity is to adopt a version of the \u201ccontextualist\u201d\napproach also mentioned in\n 3.2.2.\n On that view, since only some of one\u2019s beliefs are relevant to\na term\u2019s meaning in any context, one\u2019s other beliefs can\nturn out to be false when evaluated from that context. However, while\nthis would allow for some false beliefs, one might worry whether it\ngoes far enough. Beliefs that speakers in a context didn\u2019t agree\non could turn out to be false, but other inferences, inferences that\nintuitively seem fallible, turn out to be effectively analytic within\nthe relevant contexts. For instance if both my interlocutor and I\nbelieve \u201cAll sugar comes from sugarcane\u201d in a context\nwhere that belief is relevant (we are, for instance, asked \u201cName\na product that comes exclusively from a single type of plant\u201d)\nit would seem as if my answer \u201csugar\u201d would have to be\ncorrect on the contextualist version of meaning holism, which it\ndoesn\u2019t seem to\n be.[30]\n\n\nThe \u201canti-individualistic\u201d and \u201cnormative\u201d\nresponses to instability discussed in\n 3.2.2\n can also both do service in defending the meaning holist from worries\nabout objectivity. The anti-individualist strategy would do a good job\naccounting for individual error, since individual inferences\ncan be understood as mistaken in virtue of being out of line with the\npreferred social usage. Nevertheless, understanding how the preferred\nsocial usage (be it expert usage, majority usage, or something else)\ncould be mistaken would still be a problem on such an account. The\nnormative strategy, on the other hand, build\u2019s a notion of\nobjectivity directly into the use appealed to, and so seems best\nplaced to respect the purported objectivity of our claims (the fact\nthat the inferences that we should make couldn\u2019t turn\nout to be mistaken on such an account doesn\u2019t seem particularly\ntroubling). However, as discussed in\n 3.2.2,\n both of the anti-individualistic and normative responses detach\nmeaning from individual use in a way that many meaning holists would\nfind unacceptable.\n",
