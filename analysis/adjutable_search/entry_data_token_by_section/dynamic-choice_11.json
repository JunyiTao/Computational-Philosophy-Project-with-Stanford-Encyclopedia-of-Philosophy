Some Familiar Phenomena Illuminated by Dynamic Choice Theory\n\nAlthough dynamic choice problems are often presented with the help of\nfanciful thought experiments, their interest is not strictly\ntheoretical. As this section highlights, they can wreak havoc in our\nreal lives, supporting phenomena such as self-destructive addictive\nbehavior and dangerous environmental destruction. In some cases, these\nphenomena can be understood in terms of procrastination (Andreou\n2007), which seems to be, by its very nature, a dynamic choice problem\n(Stroud 2010).\n\nAccording to the most familiar model of self-destructive addictive\nbehavior, such behavior results from cravings that limit \u201cthe\nscope for volitional control of behavior\u201d and can in some cases\nbe irresistible, \u201coverwhelm[ing] decision making\naltogether\u201d (Loewenstein 1999, 235\u20136). But, as we know\nfrom dynamic choice theory, self-destructive behavior need not be\ncompelled. It can also be supported by challenging choice situations\nand problematic preference structures that prompt dynamic choice\nproblems. Reflection on this point has led to new ideas concerning\npossible sources of self-destructive addictive behavior. For example,\nGeorge Ainslie (2001) has developed the view that addictive habits\nsuch as smoking\u2014which can, it seems, flourish even in the\nabsence of irresistible craving\u2014are often supported by\ndiscounting-induced preference reversals. Given the possibility of\ndiscounting-induced preference reversals, even someone who cares\ndeeply about having a healthy future, and who therefore does not want\nto be a heavy smoker, can easily find herself smoking cigarette after\ncigarette, where this figures as a series of indulgences that she\nplans against and then regrets.\n\nReflection on dynamic choice theory has also led to new ideas in\nenvironmental philosophy. For example, Chrisoula Andreou (2006) argues\nthat, although dangerous environmental destruction is usually analyzed\nas resulting from interpersonal conflicts of interest, such\ndestruction can flourish even in the absence of such conflicts. In\nparticular, where individually negligible effects are involved, as is\nthe case among \u201ccreeping environmental problems\u201d such as\npollution, \u201can agent, whether it be an individual or a\nunified collective, can be led down a course of destruction\nsimply as a result of following its informed and perfectly\nunderstandable but intransitive preferences\u201d (Andreou\n2006, 96). Notice, for example, that if a unified collective values a\nhealthy community, but also values luxuries whose production or use\npromotes a carcinogenic environment, it can find itself in a situation\nthat is structurally similar to the situation of the self-torturer.\nLike the self-torturer, such a collective must cope with the fact that\nwhile one more day, and perhaps even one more month of indulgence can\nprovide great rewards without bringing about any significant\nalterations in (physical or psychic) health, \u201csustained\nindulgence is far from innocuous\u201d (Andreou 2006, 101).\n\nClearly, success in achieving a long-term goal can require showing\nsome restraint along the way; but it is tempting to put off showing\nrestraint and to favor a bit more indulgence over embarking on the\nchallenging doings or omissions that will serve the valued long-term\ngoal. Here, as in many other contexts, procrastination figures as a\nserious threat.\n\nThough both philosophically intriguing and practically significant,\nprocrastination has only recently received substantial attention as an\nimportant topic of philosophical debate. (Much of the debate can be\nfound in a collection of papers on the topic edited by Chrisoula\nAndreou and Mark D. White (2010).) It has perhaps been assumed that\nprocrastination is just a form of weakness of will and so, although\nthere has been little explicit discussion of procrastination, most of\nthe philosophical work necessary for understanding procrastination has\nalready been done. But, as Sarah Stroud has argued (2010), this\nassumption is problematic, since there are cases of procrastination\nthat do not fit with the traditional conception of weakness of will,\nwhich casts the agent as acting against her better judgment, or with\nthe influential revisionary conception of weakness of will due to\nRichard Holton (1999), which casts the agent as acting irresolutely.\nAlthough the well-developed literature on weakness of will is an\nimportant resource in the study of procrastination, there is a lot\nmore philosophical work that needs to be done, and the modeling work\nthat seems to be most promising focuses heavily on the fact that\nprocrastination is a problem faced by agents whose choices are spread\nout over time.\n",
