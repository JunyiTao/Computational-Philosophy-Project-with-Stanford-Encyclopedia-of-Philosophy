What is Mathematical Platonism?\n\nMathematical platonism can be defined as the conjunction of the\nfollowing three theses:\n\nExistence.\nThere are mathematical objects.\nAbstractness.\nMathematical objects are abstract.\nIndependence.\nMathematical objects are independent of intelligent agents and\ntheir language, thought, and practices.\n\n\nSome representative definitions of \u2018mathematical\nplatonism\u2019 are listed in the supplement\n\nSome Definitions of Platonism\n\n\nand document that the above definition is fairly standard.\n\nPlatonism in general (as opposed to platonism about mathematics\nspecifically) is any view that arises from the above three claims by\nreplacing the adjective \u2018mathematical\u2019 by any other\nadjective.\n\nThe first two claims are tolerably clear for present purposes.\nExistence can be formalized as \u2018\\(\\exists\nxMx\\)\u2019, where \u2018\\(Mx\\)\u2019 abbreviates the predicate\n\u2018\\(x\\) is a mathematical object\u2019 which is true of all and\nonly the objects studied by pure mathematics, such as numbers, sets,\nand functions. Abstractness says that every\nmathematical object is abstract, where an object is said to be\nabstract just in case it is non-spatiotemporal and (therefore)\ncausally inefficacious. (For further discussion, see the entry on\n abstract objects.)\n\nIndependence is less clear than the other two claims.\nWhat does it mean to ascribe this sort of independence to an object?\nThe most obvious gloss is probably the counterfactual conditional\nthat, had there not been any intelligent agents, or had their\nlanguage, thought, or practices been different, there would still have\nbeen mathematical objects. However, it is doubtful that this gloss\nwill do all the work that Independence is supposed to\ndo (see Section\n 4.1).\n For now, Independence will be left somewhat\nschematic.\n1.1 Historical remarks\n\nPlatonism must be distinguished from the view of the historical Plato.\nFew parties to the contemporary debate about platonism make strong\nexegetical claims about Plato\u2019s view, much less defend it.\nAlthough the view that we are calling \u2018platonism\u2019 is\ninspired by Plato\u2019s famous theory of abstract and eternal Forms\n(see the entry on\n Plato\u2019s metaphysics and epistemology),\n platonism is now defined and debated independently of its original\nhistorical inspiration.\n\nNot only is the platonism under discussion not Plato\u2019s,\nplatonism as characterized above is a purely metaphysical view: it\nshould be distinguished from other views that have substantive\nepistemological content. Many older characterizations of platonism add\nstrong epistemological claims to the effect that we have some\nimmediate grasp of, or insight into, the realm of abstract objects.\n(See e.g., Rees 1967.) But it is useful (and nowadays fairly standard)\nto reserve the term \u2018platonism\u2019 for the purely\nmetaphysical view described above. Many philosophers who defend\nplatonism in this purely metaphysical sense would reject the\nadditional epistemological claims. Examples include Quine and other\nphilosophers attracted to the so-called indispensability\nargument, which seeks to give a broadly empirical defense of\nmathematical platonism. (See the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nFinally, the above definition of \u2018mathematical platonism\u2019\nexcludes the claim that all truths of pure mathematics are necessary,\nalthough this claim has traditionally been made by most platonists.\nAgain, this exclusion is justified by the fact that some philosophers\nwho are generally regarded as platonists (for instance, Quine and some\nadherents of the aforementioned indispensability argument) reject this\nadditional modal claim .\n1.2 The philosophical significance of mathematical platonism\n\nMathematical platonism has considerable philosophical significance. If\nthe view is true, it will put great pressure on the physicalist idea\nthat reality is exhausted by the physical. For platonism entails that\nreality extends far beyond the physical world and includes objects\nthat aren\u2019t part of the causal and spatiotemporal order studied\nby the physical\n sciences.[1]\n Mathematical platonism, if true, will also put great pressure on many\nnaturalistic theories of knowledge. For there is little doubt that we\npossess mathematical knowledge. The truth of mathematical platonism\nwould therefore establish that we have knowledge of abstract (and thus\ncausally inefficacious) objects. This would be an important discovery,\nwhich many naturalistic theories of knowledge would struggle to\naccommodate.\n\nAlthough these philosophical consequences are not unique to\nmathematical platonism, this particular form of platonism is\nunusually well suited to support such consequences. For mathematics is\na remarkably successful discipline, both in its own right and as a\ntool for other\n sciences.[2]\n Few contemporary analytic philosophers are willing to contradict any\nof the core claims of a discipline whose scientific credentials are as\nstrong as those of mathematics (Lewis 1991, pp. 57\u20139). So if\nphilosophical analysis revealed mathematics to have some strange and\nsurprising consequences, it would be unattractive simply to reject\n mathematics.[3]\n A form of platonism based on a discipline whose scientific\ncredentials are less impressive than those of mathematics would not be\nin this fortunate situation. For instance, when theology turns out to\nhave some strange and surprising philosophical consequences, many\nphilosophers do not hesitate to reject the relevant parts of\ntheology.\n1.3 Object realism\n\nLet object realism be the view that there exist abstract\nmathematical objects. Object realism is thus just the conjunction of\nExistence and\n Abstractness.[4]\n Object realism stands opposed to nominalism, which in\ncontemporary philosophy is typically defined as the view that there\nare no abstract objects. (In more traditional philosophical usage the\nword \u2018nominalism\u2019 refers instead to the view that there\nare no universals. See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 13\u201325 and\nthe entry on\n abstract objects.)\n \n\nBecause object realism leaves out Independence, this\nview is logically weaker than mathematical platonism. The\nphilosophical consequences of object realism are thus not as strong as\nthose of platonism. Many physicalists would accept non-physical\nobjects provided that these are dependent on or reducible to physical\nobjects. They may for instance accept objects such as corporations,\nlaws, and poems, provided that these are suitably dependent or\nreducible to physical objects. Moreover, there appears to be no\nmystery about epistemic access to non-physical objects that we have\nsomehow made or \u2018constituted\u2019. If corporations, laws, and\npoems are made or \u2018constituted\u2019 by us, presumably we gain\nknowledge of them in the process of making or\n\u2018constituting\u2019 them.\n\nSome views in the philosophy of mathematics are object realist without\nbeing platonist. One example are traditional intuitionist views, which\naffirm the existence of mathematical objects but maintain that these\nobjects depend on or are constituted by mathematicians and their\n activities.[5]\n Some further examples of views that are object realist without being\nplatonist will be discussed in Section\n 4.\n1.4 Truth-value realism\n\nTruth-value realism is the view that every well-formed\nmathematical statement has a unique and objective truth-value that is\nindependent of whether it can be known by us and whether it follows\nlogically from our current mathematical theories. The view also holds\nthat most mathematical statements that are deemed to be true are in\nfact true. So truth-value realism is clearly a metaphysical\nview. But unlike platonism it is not an ontological view. For\nalthough truth-value realism claims that mathematical statements have\nunique and objective truth-values, it is not committed to the\ndistinctively platonist idea that these truth-values are to be\nexplained in terms of an ontology of mathematical objects.\n\nMathematical platonism clearly motivates truth-value realism by\nproviding an account of how mathematical statements get their\ntruth-values. But the former view does not entail the latter unless\nfurther premises are added. For even if there are mathematical\nobjects, referential and quantificational indeterminacy may deprive\nmathematical statements of a unique and objective truth-value.\nConversely, truth-value realism does not by itself entail\nExistence and thus implies neither object realism nor\nplatonism. For there are various accounts of how mathematical\nstatements can come to possess unique and objective truth-values which\ndo not posit a realm of mathematical\n objects.[6]\n\nIn fact, many nominalists endorse truth-value realism, at least about\nmore basic branches of mathematics, such as arithmetic. Nominalists of\nthis type are committed to the slightly odd-sounding view that,\nalthough the ordinary mathematical statement\n\n(1)\nThere are primes numbers between 10 and 20.\n\n\nis true, there are in fact no mathematical objects and thus in\nparticular no numbers. But there is no contradiction here. We must\ndistinguish between the language \\(L_M\\) in which mathematicians make\ntheir claims and the language \\(L_P\\) in which nominalists and other\nphilosophers make theirs. The statement (1) is made in \\(L_M\\). But\nthe nominalist\u2019s assertion that (1) is true but that there are\nno abstract objects is made in \\(L_P\\). The nominalist\u2019s\nassertion is thus perfectly coherent provided that (1) is translated\nnon-homophonically from \\(L_M\\) into \\(L_P\\). And indeed, when the\nnominalist claims that the truth-values of sentences of \\(L_M\\) are\nfixed in a way that doesn\u2019t appeal to mathematical objects, it\nis precisely this sort of non-homophonic translation she has in mind.\nThe view mentioned in the previous note provides an example.\n\nThis shows that for the claim Existence to have its\nintended effect, it must be expressed in the language \\(L_P\\) used by\nus philosophers. If the claim was expressed in the language \\(L_M\\)\nused by mathematicians, then nominalists could accept the claim while\nstill denying that there are mathematical objects, contrary to the\npurpose of the claim.\n\nA small but important tradition of philosophers urge that the debate\nabout platonism should be replaced by, or at least transformed into, a\ndebate about truth-value realism. One reason offered in support of\nthis view is that the former debate is hopelessly unclear, while the\nlatter is more tractable (Dummett 1978a, pp. 228\u2013232 and Dummett\n1991b, pp. 10\u201315). Another reason offered is that the debate\nabout truth-value realism is of greater importance to both philosophy\nand mathematics than the one about\n platonism.[7]\n1.5 The mathematical significance of platonism\n\nWorking realism is the methodological view that mathematics\nshould be practiced as if platonism was true (Bernays 1935,\nShapiro 1997, pp. 21\u201327 and 38\u201344). This requires some\nexplanation. In debates about the foundations of mathematics platonism\nhas often been used to defend certain mathematical methods, such as\nthe following:\n\nClassical first-order (or stronger) languages whose singular terms\nand quantifiers appear to be referring to and ranging over\nmathematical objects. (This contrasts with the languages that\ndominated earlier in the history of mathematics, which relied more\nheavily on constructive and modal vocabulary.)\nClassical rather than intuitionistic logic.\nNon-constructive methods (such as non-constructive existence\nproofs) and non-constructive axioms (such as the Axiom of\nChoice).\nImpredicative definitions (that is, definitions that quantify over\na totality to which the object being defined would belong).\n\u2018Hilbertian optimism\u2019, that is, the belief that every\nmathematical problem is in principle\n solvable.[8]\n\n\nAccording to working realism, these and other classical methods are\nacceptable and available in all mathematical reasoning. But working\nrealism does not take a stand on whether these methods require any\nphilosophical defense, and if so, whether this defense must be based\non platonism. In short, where platonism is an explicitly philosophical\nview, working realism is first and foremost a view within mathematics\nitself about the correct methodology of this discipline. Platonism and\nworking realism are therefore distinct views.\n\nHowever, there may of course be logical relations between the two\nviews. Given the origin of working realism, it is not surprising that\nthe view receives strong support from mathematical platonism. Assume\nthat mathematical platonism is true. Then clearly the language of\nmathematics ought to be as described in (i). Secondly, provided it is\nlegitimate to reason classically about any independently existing part\nof reality, (ii) would also follow. Thirdly, since platonism ensures\nthat mathematics is discovered rather than invented, there would be no\nneed for mathematicians to restrict themselves to constructive methods\nand axioms, which establishes (iii). Fourth, there is a powerful and\ninfluential argument due to G\u00f6del (1944) that impredicative\ndefinitions are legitimate whenever the objects being defined exist\nindependently of our definitions. (For instance, \u2018the tallest\nboy in the class\u2019 appears unproblematic despite being\nimpredicative.) If this is correct, then (iv) would follow. Finally,\nif mathematics is about some independently existing reality, then\nevery mathematical problem has a unique and determinate answer, which\nprovides at least some motivation for Hilbertian optimism. (See,\nhowever, the discussion of plenitudinous platonism in Section\n 4.2.)\n\nThe truth of mathematical platonism would therefore have important\nconsequences within mathematics itself. It would justify the classical\nmethods associated with working realism and encourage the search for\nnew axioms to settle questions (such as the Continuum Hypothesis)\nwhich are left open by our current mathematical theories.\n\nHowever, working realism does not in any obvious way imply platonism.\nAlthough working realism says that we are justified in using the\nplatonistic language of contemporary mathematics, this falls short of\nplatonism in at least two ways. As the above discussion of truth-value\nrealism showed, the platonistic language of mathematics can be\nanalysed in such a way as to avoid reference to and quantification\nover mathematical objects. Moreover, even if a face-value analysis of\nthe language of mathematics could be justified, this would support\nobject realism but not platonism. An additional argument would be\nneeded for the third component of platonism, namely,\nIndependence. The prospects for such an argument are\ndiscussed in Section\n 4.1.\n2. The Fregean Argument for Existence\n\nWe now describe a template of an argument for the existence of\nmathematical objects. Since the first philosopher who developed an\nargument of this general form was Frege, it will be referred to as\nthe Fregean argument. But the template is general and\nabstracts away from most specific aspects of Frege\u2019s own defense\nof the existence of mathematical objects, such as his view that\narithmetic is reducible to logic. Fregean logicism is just one way in\nwhich this template can be developed; some other ways will be\nmentioned below.\n2.1 The structure of the argument\n\nThe Fregean argument is based on two premises, the first of which\nconcerns the semantics of the language of mathematics:\n\nClassical Semantics.\nThe singular terms of the language of mathematics purport to refer\nto mathematical objects, and its first-order quantifiers purport to\nrange over such objects.\n\n\nThe word \u2018purport\u2019 needs to be explained. When a sentence\n\\(S\\) purports to refer or quantify in a certain way, this means that\nfor \\(S\\) to be true, \\(S\\) must succeed in referring or quantifying\nin this way.\n\nThe second premise does not require much explanation:\n\nTruth.\nMost sentences accepted as mathematical theorems are true\n(regardless of their syntactic and semantic structure).\n\n\nConsider sentences that are accepted as mathematical theorems and that\ncontain one or more mathematical singular terms. By\nTruth, most of these sentences are\n true.[9]\n Let \\(S\\) be one such sentence. By Classical\nSemantics, the truth of \\(S\\) requires that its singular\nterms succeed in referring to mathematical objects. Hence there must\nbe mathematical objects, as asserted by\n Existence.[10]\n2.2 Defending Classical Semantics\n\nClassical Semantics claims that the language of\nmathematics functions semantically much like language in general\nfunctions (or at least has traditionally been assumed to function):\nthe semantic functions of singular terms and quantifiers are to refer\nto objects and to range over objects, respectively. This is a broadly\nempirical claim about the workings of a semi-formal language used by\nthe community of professional mathematicians. (In the widely adopted\nterminology of Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 6\u20137,\nClassical Semantics is a hermeneutic claim;\nthat is, it is a descriptive claim about how a certain language is\nactually used, not a normative claim about how this language ought to\nbe used.) Note also that Classical Semantics is\ncompatible with most traditional views on semantics; in particular, it\nis compatible with all the standard views on the meanings of\nsentences, namely that they are truth-values, propositions, or sets of\npossible worlds.\n\nClassical Semantics enjoys strong prima\nfacie plausibility. For the language of mathematics strongly\nappears to have the same semantic structure as ordinary\nnon-mathematical language. As Burgess (1999) observes, the following\ntwo sentences appear to have the same simple semantic structure of a\npredicate being ascribed to a subject (p. 288):\n\nEvelyn is prim.\nEleven is prime.\n\n\nThis appearance is also borne out by the standard semantic analyses\nproposed by linguists and semanticists.\n\nClassical Semantics has nevertheless been challenged,\nfor instance by nominalists such as Hellman (1989) and by Hofweber\n(2005 and 2016). (See also Moltmann (2013) for some challenges\nconcerned with arithmetical vocabulary in natural language, as well as\nSnyder (2017) for discussion.) This is not the place for an extended\ndiscussion of such challenges. Let me just note that a lot of work is\nneeded to substantiate this sort of challenge. The challenger will\nhave to argue that the apparent semantic similarities between\nmathematical and non-mathematical language are deceptive. And these\narguments will have to be of the sort that linguists and\nsemanticists\u2014with no vested interest in the philosophy of\nmathematics\u2014could come to recognize as\n significant.[11]\n2.3 Defending Truth\n\nTruth can be defended in a variety of different ways.\nCommon to all defenses is that they first identify some standard by\nwhich the truth-values of mathematical statements can be assessed and\nthen argue that mathematical theorems meet this standard.\n\nOne option is to appeal to a standard that is more fundamental than\nthat of mathematics itself. Logicism provides an example. Frege and\nother logicists first claim that any theorem of pure logic is true.\nThen they attempt to show that the theorems of certain branches of\nmathematics can be proved from pure logic and definitions alone.\n\nAnother option is to appeal to the standards of empirical science. The\nQuine-Putnam indispensability argument provides an example. First it\nis argued that any indispensable part of empirical science is likely\nto be true and therefore something we are justified in believing. Then\nit is argued that large amounts of mathematics are indispensable to\nempirical science. If both claims are correct, it follows that\nTruth is likely to be true and that belief in\nTruth therefore is justified. (See the entry on\n indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nA third option is to appeal to the standards of mathematics itself.\nWhy should one have to appeal to non-mathematical standards, such as\nthose of logic or empirical science, in order to defend the truth of\nmathematical theorems? When we defend the truth of the claims of logic\nand physics, we do not need to appeal to standards outside of\nrespectively logic and physics. Rather we assume that logic and\nphysics provide their own sui generis standards of\njustification. Why should mathematics be any different? This third\nstrategy has received a lot of attention in recent years, often under\nthe heading of \u2018naturalism\u2019 or \u2018mathematical\nnaturalism\u2019. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, Maddy 1997, and, for\ncritical discussion, see the entry on\n naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)\n\nHere is an example of how a naturalistic strategy can be developed.\nCall the attitude that mathematicians take to the theorems of\nmathematics \u2018acceptance\u2019. Then the following claims seem\nplausible:\n\n(2)\nMathematicians are justified in accepting the theorems of\nmathematics.\n(3)\nAccepting a mathematical statement \\(S\\) involves taking \\(S\\) to\nbe true.\n(4)\nWhen a mathematician accepts a mathematical statement \\(S\\), the\ncontent of this attitude is in general the literal meaning of\n\\(S\\).\n\n\nFrom these three claims it follows that mathematical experts are\njustified in taking the theorems of mathematics to be literal truths.\nBy extension the rest of us too are justified in believing\nTruth. Note that the experts with whom (2) is\nconcerned need not themselves believe (3) and (4), let alone be\njustified in any such belief. What matters is that the three claims\nare true. The task of establishing the truth of (3) and (4) may fall\nto linguists, psychologists, sociologists, or philosophers, but\ncertainly not to mathematicians themselves.\n\nAdmittedly, fictionalists about mathematics will try to resist (3) or\n(4). See Field (1982), Yablo (2005), Leng (2010), as well as the entry\non\n fictionalism in the philosophy of mathematics.\n \n2.4 The notion of ontological commitment\n\nVersions of the Fregean argument are sometimes stated in terms of the\nnotion of ontological commitment. Suppose we operate with the standard\nQuinean criterion of ontological commitment:\n\nQuine\u2019s Criterion.\nA first-order sentence (or collection of such sentences) is\nontologically committed to such objects as must be assumed to be in\nthe range of the variables for the sentence (or collection of\nsentences) to be true.\n\n\nThen it follows from Classical Semantics that many\nsentences of mathematics are ontologically committed to mathematical\nobjects. To see this, consider a typical mathematical theorem \\(S\\),\nwhich involves some normal extensional occurrence of either singular\nterms or first-order quantifiers. By Classical\nSemantics, these expressions purport to refer to or range\nover mathematical objects. For \\(S\\) to be true, these expressions\nmust succeed in doing what they purport to do. Consequently, for \\(S\\)\nto be true, there must be mathematical objects in the range of the\nvariables. By Quine\u2019s Criterion this means that\n\\(S\\) is ontologically committed to mathematical objects.\n\nQuine and many others take Quine\u2019s Criterion to\nbe little more than a definition of the term \u2018ontological\ncommitment\u2019 (Quine 1969 and Burgess 2004). But the criterion has\nnevertheless been challenged. Some philosophers deny that singular\nterms and first-order quantifiers automatically give rise to\nontological commitments. Perhaps what is \u201crequired of the\nworld\u201d for the sentence to be true involves the existence of\nsome but not all of the objects in the range of the quantifiers (Rayo\n2008). Or perhaps we should sever the link between the first-order\nexistential quantifier and the notion of ontological commitment\n(Azzouni 2004, Hofweber 2000 and 2016).\n\nOne response to these challenges is to observe that the Fregean\nargument was developed above without any use of the term\n\u2018ontological commitment\u2019. Any challenge to the definition\nof \u2018ontological commitment\u2019 provided by\nQuine\u2019s Criterion therefore appears irrelevant\nto the version of the Fregean argument developed above. However, this\nresponse is unlikely to satisfy the challengers, who will respond that\nthe conclusion of the argument developed above is too weak to have its\nintended effect. Recall that the conclusion,\nExistence, is formalized in our philosophical\nmeta-language \\(L_P\\) as \u2018\\(\\exists xMx\\)\u2019. So this\nformalization will fail to have its intended effect unless this\nmeta-language sentence is of the sort that incurs ontological\ncommitment. But that is precisely what the challengers dispute. This\ncontroversy cannot be pursued further here. For now, we simply observe\nthat the challengers need to provide an account of why their\nnon-standard notion of ontological commitment is better and\ntheoretically more interesting than the standard Quinean notion.\n2.5 From Existence to Mathematical Platonism?\n\nSuppose we accept Existence, perhaps based on the\nFregean argument. As we have seen, this is not yet to accept\nmathematical platonism, which is the result of adding to\nExistence the two further claims\nAbstractness and Independence. Are\nthese two further claims defensible?\n\nBy the standards of philosophy, Abstractness has\nremained relatively uncontroversial. Among the few philosophers to\nhave challenged it are Maddy (1990) (concerning impure sets) and\nBigelow (1988) (concerning sets and various kinds of numbers). This\nrelative lack of controversy means that few explicit defenses of\nAbstractness have been developed. But it is not hard\nto see how such a defense might go. Here is one idea. It is a\nplausible prima facie constraint on any philosophical\ninterpretation of mathematical practice that it should avoid ascribing\nto mathematics any features that would render actual mathematical\npractice misguided or inadequate. This constraint makes it hard to\ndeny that the objects of pure mathematics are abstract. For if these\nobjects had spatiotemporal locations, then actual mathematical\npractice would be misguided and inadequate, since pure mathematicians\nought then to take an interest in the locations of their objects, just\nas zoologists take an interest in the locations of animals. The fact\nthat pure mathematicians take no interest in this question suggests\nthat their objects are abstract.\n\nIndependence says that mathematical objects, if there\nare any, are independent of intelligent agents and their language,\nthought, and practices. We will discuss what this thesis might amount\nto, and how it might be defended, in Section\n 4.\n3. Objections to Mathematical Platonism\n\nA variety of objections to mathematical platonism have been developed.\nHere are the most important ones.\n3.1 Epistemological access\n\nThe most influential objection is probably the one inspired by\nBenacerraf (1973). What follows is an improved version of\nBenacerraf\u2019s objection due to Field\n (1989).[12]\n This version relies on the following three premises.\n\n\nPremise 1.\nMathematicians are reliable, in the sense that for almost every\nmathematical sentence \\(S\\), if mathematicians accept \\(S\\), then\n\\(S\\) is true. \n\nPremise 2.\nFor belief in mathematics to be justified, it must at least in\nprinciple be possible to explain the reliability described in Premise\n1. \n\nPremise 3.\nIf mathematical platonism is true, then this reliability cannot\nbe explained even in principle. \n\n\nIf these three premises are correct, it will follow that mathematical\nplatonism undercuts our justification for believing in\nmathematics.\n\nBut are the premises correct? The first two premises are relatively\nuncontroversial. Most platonists are already committed to Premise 1.\nAnd Premise 2 seems fairly secure. If the reliability of some belief\nformation procedure could not even in principle be explained, then the\nprocedure would seem to work purely by chance, thus undercutting any\njustification we have for the beliefs produced in this way.\n\nPremise 3 is far more controversial. Field defends this premise by\nobserving that \u201cthe truth-values of our mathematical assertions\ndepend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm\noutside of space-time\u201d (Field 1989, p. 68) and thus are causally\nisolated from us even in principle. However, this defense assumes that\nany adequate explanation of the reliability in question must involve\nsome causal correlation. This has been challenged by a variety of\nphilosophers who have proposed more minimal explanations of the\nreliability claim. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 41\u201349 and\nLewis 1991, pp. 111\u2013112; cf. also Clarke-Doane 2016. See Linnebo\n2006 for a\n critique.)[13]\n3.2 A metaphysical objection\n\nAnother famous article by Benacerraf develops a metaphysical objection\nto mathematical platonism (Benacerraf 1965, cf. also Kitcher 1978).\nAlthough Benacerraf focuses on arithmetic, the objection naturally\ngeneralizes to most pure mathematical objects.\n\nBenacerraf opens by defending what is now known as a structuralist\nview of the natural numbers, according to which the natural numbers\nhave no properties other than those they have in virtue of being\npositions in an \\(\\omega\\)-sequence. For instance, there is nothing\nmore to being the number 3 than having certain intrastructurally\ndefined relational properties, such as succeeding 2, being half of 6,\nand being prime. No matter how hard we study arithmetic and set\ntheory, we will never know whether 3 is identical with the fourth von\nNeumann ordinal, or with the corresponding Zermelo ordinal, or\nperhaps, as Frege suggested, with the class of all three-membered\nclasses (in some system that allows such classes to exist).\n\nBenacerraf now draws the following conclusion:\n\nTherefore, numbers are not objects at all, because in giving the\nproperties \u2026of numbers you merely characterize an abstract\nstructure\u2014and the distinction lies in the fact that the\n\u201celements\u201d of the structure have no properties other than\nthose relating them to other \u201celements\u201d of the same\nstructure. (Benacerraf 1965, p. 291)\n\n\nIn other words, Benacerraf claims that there can be no objects which\nhave nothing but structural properties. All objects must have some\nnon-structural properties as well. (See Benacerraf 1996 for some later\nreflections on this argument.)\n\nBoth of the steps of Benacerraf\u2019s argument are controversial.\nThe first step\u2014that natural numbers have only structural\nproperties\u2014has been defended by a variety of mathematical\nstructuralists (Parsons 1990, Resnik 1997, and Shapiro 1997, as well\nas Schiemer & Wigglesworth 2019 for the notion of a structural\nproperty). But this step is denied by logicists and neo-logicists, who\nclaim that the natural numbers are intrinsically tied to the\ncardinalities of the collections that they number (Wright 2000). And\nthe second step\u2014that there can be no objects with only\nstructural properties\u2014is explicitly rejected by all of the\nstructuralists who defend the first step. (For some voices sympathetic\nto the second step, see Hellman 2001 and MacBride 2005. See also\nLinnebo 2008 for discussion.)\n3.3 Other metaphysical objections\n\nIn addition to Benacerraf\u2019s, a variety of metaphysical\nobjections to mathematical platonism have been developed. One of the\nmore famous examples is an argument of Nelson Goodman\u2019s against\nset theory. Goodman (1956) defends the Principle of\nNominalism, which states that whenever two entities have the same\nbasic constituents, they are identical. This principle can be regarded\nas a strengthening of the familiar set theoretic axiom of\nextensionality. The axiom of extensionality states that if two sets\n\\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have the same elements\u2014that is, if \\(\\forall u(u\n\\in x \\leftrightarrow u \\in y)\\)\u2014then they are identical. The\nPrinciple of Nominalism is obtained by replacing the membership\nrelation with its transitive\n closure.[14]\n The principle thus states that if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are borne \\(\\in^*\\)\nby the same individuals\u2014that is, if \\(\\forall u(u \\in^*\\) \\(x\n\\leftrightarrow u \\in^*\\) \\(y)\\)\u2014then \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are\nidentical. By endorsing this principle, Goodman disallows the\nformation of sets and classes, allowing only the formation of\nmereological sums and the application to the standard mereological\noperations (as described by his \u201ccalculus of\nindividuals\u201d).\n\nHowever, Goodman\u2019s defense of the Principle of Nominalism is now\nwidely held to be unconvincing, as witnessed by the widespread\nacceptance by philosophers and mathematicians of set theory as a\nlegitimate and valuable branch of mathematics.\n4. Between object realism and mathematical platonism\n\nObject realism says there exist abstract mathematical objects, whereas\nplatonism adds Independence, which says that\nmathematical objects are independent of intelligent agents and their\nlanguage, thought, and practices. This final section surveys some\nlightweight forms of object realism that stop short of full-fledged\nplatonism. Such intermediate views are attracting an increasing amount\nof interest. \n4.1 How To Understand Independence\n\nA natural gloss on Independence is the following\ncounterfactual conditional: \n\nCounterfactual Independence.\nHad there not been any intelligent agents, or had their language,\nthought, or practices been suitably different, there would still have\nbeen mathematical objects.\n\n\nThis counterfactual conditional is accepted by most analytic\nphilosophers. To see why, consider the role that mathematics plays in\nour reasoning. We often reason about scenarios that aren\u2019t\nactual. Were we to build a bridge across this canyon, say, how strong\nwould it have to be to withstand the powerful gusts of wind? Sadly,\nthe previous bridge collapsed. Would it have done so had the steel\ngirders been twice as thick? This form of reasoning about\ncounterfactual scenarios is indispensable both to our everyday\ndeliberations and to science. The permissibility of such reasoning has\nan important consequence. Since the truths of pure mathematics can\nfreely be appealed to throughout our counterfactual reasoning, it\nfollows that these truths are counterfactually independent of us\nhumans, and all other intelligent life for that matter. That is, had\nbeen there been no intelligent life, these truths would still have\nremained the same. \n\nPure mathematics is in this respect very different from ordinary\nempirical truths. Had intelligent life never existed, this article\nwould not have been written. More interestingly, pure mathematics also\ncontrasts with various social conventions and constructions, with\nwhich it is sometimes compared (Hersh 1997, Feferman 2009, Cole 2013).\nHad intelligent life never existed, there would have been no laws,\ncontracts, or marriages\u2014yet the mathematical truths would have\nremained the same. \n\nThus, if Independence is understood merely as\ncounterfactual independence, then anyone who accepts object realism\nshould also accept platonism. \n\nIt is doubtful, however, that this understanding of\nIndependence fully captures the intended content of\nthe thesis. For Independence is meant to substantiate\nan analogy between mathematical objects and ordinary physical objects.\nJust as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so do numbers\nand sets. And just as statements about electrons and planets are made\ntrue or false by the objects with which they are concerned and these\nobjects\u2019 perfectly objective properties, so are statements about\nnumbers and sets. (See the quotes from Dummett 1978b and Maddy 1990 in\n the supplement.)\n In short, we have the following thesis: \n\nRobust Independence.\n\nMathematical objects are metaphysically on a par with ordinary\nphysical objects.\n\nLet us now consider some views that reject the stronger thesis of\nRobust Independence. These views are thus lightweight forms of object\nrealism, which stop short of full-blown platonism. \n4.2 Plenitudious platonism\n\nOne lightweight form of object realism is the \u201cfull-blooded\nplatonism\u201d of Balaguer 1998. This view is characterized by a\nplenitude principle to the effect that any mathematical\nobjects that could exist actually do exist. For instance, since the\nContinuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axiomatization of\nset theory, there is a universe of sets in which the hypothesis is\ntrue and another in which it is false. And neither universe is\nmetaphysically privileged (Hamkins 2012). By contrast, traditional\nplatonism asserts that there is a unique universe of sets in which the\nContinuum Hypothesis is either determinately true or determinately\n false.[15]\n\nOne alleged benefit of this plenitudinous view is in the epistemology\nof mathematics. If every consistent mathematical theory is true of\nsome universe of mathematical objects, then mathematical knowledge\nwill, in some sense, be easy to obtain: provided that our mathematical\ntheories are consistent, they are guaranteed to be true of some\nuniverse of mathematical objects.\n\nHowever, \u201cfull-blooded platonism\u201d has received much\ncriticism. Colyvan and Zalta 1999 criticize it for undermining the\npossibility of reference to mathematical objects, and Restall 2003,\nfor lacking a precise and coherent formulation of the plenitude\nprinciple on which the view is based. Martin (2001) proposes that\ndifferent universes of sets be amalgamated to yield a single maximal\nuniverse, which will be privileged by fitting our conception of set\nbetter than any other universe of sets.\n\nA different version of plenitudinous platonism is developed in Linsky\n& Zalta 1995 and a series of further articles. (See, for instance,\nLinsky & Zalta 2006 and other articles cited therein.) Traditional\nplatonism goes wrong by \u201cconceiv[ing] of abstract objects on the\nmodel of physical objects\u201d (Linsky & Zalta 1995, p. 533),\nincluding in particular the idea that such objects are\n\u201csparse\u201d rather than plenitudinous. Linsky & Zalta\ndevelop an alternative approach on the basis of the second\nauthor\u2019s \u201cobject theory\u201d. The main feature of object\ntheory is a very general comprehension principle which asserts the\nexistence of a plenitude of abstract objects: for any collection of\nproperties, there is an abstract object which \u201cencodes\u201d\nprecisely these properties. In object theory, moreover, two abstract\nobjects are identical just in case they encode precisely the same\nproperties. Object theory\u2019s comprehension principle and identity\ncriterion are said to \u201cprovide the link between our cognitive\nfaculty of understanding and abstract objects\u201d (ibid.,\np. 547). (See Ebert & Rossberg 2007 for critical discussion.)\n4.3 Lightweight semantic values\n\nAssume that object realism is true. For convenience, assume also\nClassical Semantics. These assumptions ensure that\nthe singular terms and quantifiers of mathematical language refer to\nand range over abstract objects. Given these assumptions, should one\nalso be a mathematical platonist? In other words, do the objects that\nmathematical sentences refer to and quantify over satisfy either\nversion of the independence thesis?\n\nIt will be useful to restate our assumptions in more neutral terms. We\ncan do this by invoking the notion of a semantic value, which\nplays an important role in semantics and the philosophy of language.\nIn these fields it is widely assumed that each expression makes some\ndefinite contribution to the truth-value of sentences in which the\nexpression occurs. This contribution is known as the semantic\nvalue of the expression. It is widely assumed that (at least in\nextensional contexts) the semantic value of a singular term is just\nits referent.\n\nOur assumptions can now be stated neutrally as the claim that\nmathematical singular terms have abstract semantic values and that its\nquantifiers range over the kinds of item that serve as semantic\nvalues. Let\u2019s focus on the claim about singular terms. What is\nthe philosophical significance of this claim? In particular, does it\nsupport some version of Independence? The answer will\ndepend on what is required for a mathematical singular term to have a\nsemantic value.\n\nSome philosophers argue that not very much is required (Frege 1953,\nDummett 1981, Dummett 1991a, Wright 1983, Hale & Wright 2000, Rayo\n2013, and Linnebo 2012 and 2018). It suffices for the term \\(t\\) to\nmake some definite contribution to the truth-values of sentences in\nwhich it occurs. The whole purpose of the notion of a semantic value\nwas to represent such contributions. It therefore suffices for a\nsingular term to possess a semantic value that it makes some such\nsuitable contribution.\n\nThis may even open the way for a form of non-eliminative reductionism\nabout mathematical objects (Dummett 1991a, Linnebo 2018). Although it\nis perfectly true that the mathematical singular term \\(t\\) has an\nabstract object as its semantic value, this truth may obtain in virtue\nof more basic facts which do not mention or involve the relevant\nabstract object. For example, a singular term may refer to a direction\nin virtue of being associated with an appropriately oriented line and\nsubject to the criterion of identity stating that two lines specify\none and the same direction just in case they are parallel. Thus,\nalthough it is perfectly true that the term refers to an abstract\nobject, this truth obtains in virtue of some more basic facts that do\nnot mention or involve that abstract object. Linnebo (2018, ch. 11)\nargues that this approach to mathematical objects nevertheless\nvalidates Counterfactual Independence.\n\nThere is no reason, however, why an approach of this sort should be\ncommitted to Robust Independence. On the contrary, such approaches\nentail some important disanalogies between mathematical and physical\nobjects. For a direction to exist, for example, it suffices that there\nexists an appropriate oriented line that specifies that the direction.\nSince this line can be located anywhere, the existence of the\ndirection does not impose any constraints on any particular region of\nspacetime. By contrast, the existence of a physical object imposes\nsubstantial constraints on the particular region of spacetime where\nthe object is located. \n\nIn short, if some lightweight account of semantic values is\ndefensible, we can accept object realism and Counterfactual\nIndependence without committing ourselves to a more robust\nform of platonism.\n4.4 Inspiration from Aristotle\n\nWe conclude by describing two further examples of lightweight forms of\nobject realism that reject the platonistic analogy between\nmathematical objects and ordinary physical objects. Both examples are\ninspired by Aristotle.\n\nFirst, perhaps mathematical objects exist only in a potential manner,\nwhich contrasts with the actual mode of existence of ordinary physical\nobjects. This idea is at the heart of the ancient notion of potential\ninfinity (Lear 1980, Linnebo & Shapiro 2019). According to\nAristotle, the natural numbers are potentially infinite in\nthe sense that, however large a number we have produced (by\ninstantiating it in the physical world), it is possible to produce an\neven larger number. But Aristotle denies that the natural numbers are\nactually infinite: this would require the physical world to\nbe infinite, which he argues is impossible. \n\nFollowing Cantor, most mathematicians and philosophers now defend the\nactual infinity of the natural numbers. This is made possible in part\nby denying the Aristotelian requirement that every number needs to be\ninstantiated in the physical world. When this is denied, the actual\ninfinity of the natural numbers no longer entails the actual infinity\nof the physical world. \n\nHowever, a form of potentialism about the hierarchy of sets continues\nto enjoy considerable support, especially in connection with the\niterative conception of sets (Parsons 1977, Jan\u00e9 2010, Linnebo\n2013, Studd 2013). No matter how many sets have been formed, it is\npossible to form even more. If true, this would mean that sets have a\npotential form of existence which distinguishes them sharply from\nordinary physical\n objects.[16]\n\n\nSecond, perhaps mathematical objects are ontologically dependent or\nderivative in a way that distinguishes them from independently\nexisting physical objects. According to what Rosen (2011) calls\n\u201cqualified realism\u201d, mathematical facts are grounded in\nother facts that do not involve mathematical objects. For example, the\nnatural numbers exist, but their existence and their properties and\nrelations are grounded in facts more fundamental than the arithmetical\nones, e.g., in facts about provability or about structural\npossibilities. The view can also be given a more Aristotelian spin by\ntaking simple arithmetical truths to be grounded in facts about\nappropriately numerous pluralities that instantiate the relevant\nnumbers (Schwartzkopff 2011, Donaldson 2017). For example, \\(2+2=4\\)\nis grounded in any fact about a pair and a disjoint pair making a\nquadruple. There are other versions of the view as well. For example,\nKit Fine (1995) and others argue that a set is ontologically dependent\non its elements. (This view is also closely related to the\nset-theoretic potentialism mentioned above.) \n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Azzouni, Jody, 2004, <em>Deflating Existential Consequence: A Case\nfor Nominalism</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "Balaguer, Mark, 1998, <em>Platonism and Anti-Platonism in\nMathematics</em>, Oxford: Oxford University Press.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 2001, \u201cA theory of mathematical\ncorrectness and mathematical truth\u201d, <em>Pacific Philosophical\nQuarterly</em>, 82: 87\u2013114.", "Benacerraf, Paul, 1965, \u201cWhat numbers could not be\u201d,\n<em>Philosophical Review</em>, 74: 47\u201373.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1973, \u201cMathematical Truth\u201d,\n<em>Journal of Philosophy</em>, 70(19): 661\u2013679.", "\u2013\u2013\u2013, 1996, \u201cWhat mathematical truth could\nnot be, i\u201d, in <em>Benacerraf and His Critics</em>, A.
