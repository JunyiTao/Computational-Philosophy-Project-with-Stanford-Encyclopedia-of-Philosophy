    "main_text": "Problem III: Exclusion || Functionalism and Multiple Realizability\n6.1 Functionalism and Multiple Realizability\n\nNon-reductive physicalism in its current form grew out of\n functionalism,\n according to which mental properties are functional properties. To be\nin pain, for example, is a matter of being in a state with a certain\ncausal profile, a state that\u2019s caused by tissue damage, and\ncauses certain overt responses (moans, attempts to repair the damage)\nas well as other mental states (e.g., beliefs that one is in pain).\nBut, argue functionalists, it is most unlikely that we could identify\na single kind of physical state playing this role in every actual and\npossible case of pain. Human beings differ in endless tiny\nphysiological ways: your neurological states, including states you go\ninto when you are in pain, probably differ subtly from another\nperson\u2019s. Human beings\u2019 neurological states, in turn,\ndiffer from those of a cat or a dog, and perhaps dramatically from\nstates of an octopus. You might even imagine encountering aliens with\nvastly different biologies, but to which you would unhesitatingly\nascribe pains.\n\nHere we arrive at a core thesis of functionalism: states of mind are\n \u201cmultiply realizable\u201d.\n The property of being in pain can be realized in a wide variety of\nphysical (and perhaps non-physical) systems. A creature is in pain in\nvirtue of being in a state with the right sort of causal profile, some\nsort of neurological state, say. But the property of being in pain\ncannot be identified with this neurological state, because creatures\nof other kinds can be in pain in virtue of being in vastly different\nphysical conditions. Functionalists often put this point by saying\nthat mental properties are \u201chigher-level\u201d properties,\nproperties possessed by objects by virtue of their possession of\nappropriate \u201clower-level\u201d properties, their realizers.\n",
