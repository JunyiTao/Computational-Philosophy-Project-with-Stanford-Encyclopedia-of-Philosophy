    "main_text": "Religion and Social Instability\n11. Hobbes on Gender and Race\n\nScholars are increasingly interested in how Hobbes thought of the\nstatus of women, and of the family. Hobbes was one of the earliest\nwestern philosophers to count women as persons when devising a social\ncontract among persons. He insists on the equality of all people, very\nexplicitly including women. People are equal because they are all\nsubject to domination, and all potentially capable of dominating\nothers. No person is so strong as to be invulnerable to attack while\nsleeping by the concerted efforts of others, nor is any so strong as\nto be assured of dominating all others.\n\nIn this relevant sense, women are naturally equal to men. They are\nequally naturally free, meaning that their consent is required before\nthey will be under the authority of anyone else. In this,\nHobbes\u2019s claims stand in stark contrast to many prevailing views\nof the time, according to which women were born inferior to and\nsubordinate to men. Sir Robert Filmer, who later served as the target\nof John Locke\u2019s First Treatise of Government, is a\nwell-known proponent of this view, which he calls patriarchalism.\nExplicitly rejecting the patriarchalist view as well as Salic law,\nHobbes maintains that women can be sovereigns; authority for him is\n\u201cneither male nor female\u201d. He also argues for natural\nmaternal right: in the state of nature, dominion over children\nnaturally belongs to the mother. He adduced the example of the Amazon\nwarrior women as evidence.\n\nIn seeming contrast to this egalitarian foundation, Hobbes spoke of\nthe commonwealth in patriarchal language. In the move from the state\nof nature to civil society, families are described as\n\u201cfathers\u201d, \u201cservants\u201d, and\n\u201cchildren\u201d, seemingly obliterating mothers from the\npicture entirely. Hobbes justifies this way of talking by saying that\nit is fathers not mothers who have founded societies. As true as that\nis, it is easy to see how there is a lively debate between those who\nemphasize the potentially feminist or egalitarian aspects of\nHobbes\u2019s thought and those who emphasize his ultimate exclusion\nof women. Such debates raise the question: To what extent are the\npatriarchal claims Hobbes makes integral to his overall theory, if\nindeed they are integral at all?\n\nWe find similar ambiguities and tensions in what Hobbes says about\nrace (or what we would now call race). On the one hand, he invokes the\n\u201csavages\u201d of the Americas to illustrate the\n\u201cbrutish\u201d conditions of life in the state of nature. On\nthe other hand, when he simply denies that there are innate or\nimmutable differences between Native Americans and Europeans.\nSocieties which have enjoyed scientific advancement have done so,\naccording to Hobbes, because of the existence of \u201cleisure\ntime,\u201d and if that is \u201csupposed away,\u201d he asks\nrhetorically, \u201cwhat do we differ from the wildest of the\nIndians?\u201d\n",
