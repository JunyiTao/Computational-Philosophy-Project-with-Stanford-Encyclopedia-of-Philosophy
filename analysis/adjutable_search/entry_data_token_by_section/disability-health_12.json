This aspect of romantic leave can\namplify the concerns of people already skeptical about the ability of\npersons with disabilities to contribute to thriving friendships. Many\nnondisabled people may doubt that people with disabilities can be\nfulfilling partners in any loving adult relationship. Prominent\nexplanations of love, again based in Aristotle, hold that having\nloving relationships promotes self-knowledge, insofar as one\u2019s\nbeloved acts as a kind of mirror, reflecting back one\u2019s\ncharacter (see SEP entries on\n love\n and\n friendship).\n Many nondisabled people may find it hard to imagine seeing their\nreflection in a disabled partner. According to LaFollette (1996),\nlove, at least ideally, brings out the best in the participants. For\nnondisabled people, it may be hard to see past the impairment to\nimagine that a partner with a disability can bring out their best, be\nsimilar enough to understand them, enhance their self-worth, or meet\ntheir deepest needs. \n\nDisability creates a number of challenges to forging intimate physical\nand emotional relationships. People with sensory-motor impairments who\nwere disabled beginning in early life often report that they were\nsocially segregated from other children, either directly because they\nwere tracked into different classes or different schools, or\nindirectly because other students avoided them. Consequently, many\ndisabled children have not been socialized about sex in the way other\nchildren have been: even playground misinformation can play a role in\ndeveloping and affirming a sense of nascent sexual identity in\nable-bodied children, yet disabled children are often excluded from\nthis process. To make matters worse, many disabled children do not\nreceive sex education until a much later age than their able-bodied\npeers (if at all), a reflection of the pervasive stereotype that\ndisabled people are infantile and asexual (Shakespeare 1996). \n\nThese challenges persist into adulthood. When disabled people form\nintimate relationships with other adults, cultural stereotypes and\nprejudices continue to exact a high cost. Disabled people are often\nexpected to be \u201cwith their own kind\u201d, and if they do form\nintimate relationships with unimpaired people, they must confront\npatronizing assumptions about the \u201creal\u201d reasons for the\nrelationship: dependency, pity, etc.. When disabled people form\nintimate relationships with one another, they must overcome\npsychological barriers to intimacy that result from society\u2019s\nviews about what an appropriate partner would be or what acceptable\nsexual activity is. Or they must battle family opposition to being\nwith a partner whose similar or different disability prevents that\npartner from assuming the role of \u201ccaregiver\u201d or personal\nassistant. Emens (2009) shows how institutional practices, along with\nphysical and communication barriers, perpetuate and reinforce\nprevailing views that people with disabilities will be incapable of\nparticipating in sexual and partner relationships. \n\nFor various reasons, people with intellectual disabilities have been\nthought incapable of understanding and appreciating the value of\nromantic, sexual, or partner relationships. But as first-person\nnarratives attest, disabled people have grown quite adept at\nnavigating and even overcoming these challenges (Shakespeare 1996).\nNarratives and research demonstrate that even people with\ndevelopmental disabilities or dementia can and often do consent to\nmutual, sustained sexual relations (Kaeser 1992). This is not to deny,\nobviously, that some disabled people lack the cognitive abilities\nnecessary to genuinely consent to sex.\n",
