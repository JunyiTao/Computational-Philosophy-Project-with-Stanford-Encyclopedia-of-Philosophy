    "main_text": "Life and his philosophical and religious project || Conversion and formation\n1.1 Conversion and formation\n\nThe process through which Ramon Llull was converted to Christianity is\nnarrated in De vita coaetanea I-4: Llull was writing \u201ca\nsong to a lady whom he loved with a foolish love\u201d (and was not\nhis wife) when he saw an apparition of Christ on the Cross. This\nvision would not be enough for him to fully understand and embrace the\ncalling. Thus, it would be repeated another four times while he\ncontinued to attempt to write the aforementioned love song. Finally,\nthe voice of\n\n\nhis conscience told him that they (the apparitions) could only mean\nthat he should abandon the world at once and from then on dedicate\nhimself totally to the service of our Lord Jesus Christ. (De\nVita I\u20134. Translation Anthony Bonner)\n\n\nThe call to faith was accompanied by a decision to dedicate his life\nto the service of God. That moment is recalled in De vita\ncoaetanea, where he reflected on the way in\nwhich he could serve God and conceived an action plan that outlined\nthree main objectives: in converting unbelievers to Christ, in writing\nbooks against the errors of the infidels, and in funding monasteries\nin which the different languages necessary for this mission could be\ntaught.\n\nThe project demonstrates a novel conviction that the\nrational dialogue between religions is, as Mayer (2010, 53) pointed\nout, \u201cthe way to establish a single faith and a sigle universal\nreligious law based on overcoming the differences between the three\nmonotheist religions: Chrstianity, Judaism and Islam\u201d. But the\nproject that Ramon Llull resolved to undertake entailed a greater\ndifficulty that he himself acknowledged: he had none of the knowledge\nnecessary for such an undertaking. Consequently, a fundamental part of\nhis project would be his education in two cultures and languages he\ndid not thoroughly know: Latin and Arabic.\n\nThe apparitions and the reflection on his mission are nothing but the\nbeginning of the process of conversion. For three months, according to\nDe vita coaetanea, Llull did not undertake any of his\nprojects.\n\nOn Saint Francis\u2019 feast day, observed on October 4, he listened\nto the bishop as he described the conversion of Saint Francis of\nAssisi. Impressed by the example set by the saint, Llull decided to\nsell most of his material possessions, just keeping the bare minimum\nfor the support of his wife and children, and set out on a\npilgrimage.\n\nIf they ever occurred, the episodes of the apparitions must have taken\nplace between 1263 and 1265, but no testimonies have been found to\nsupport this claim. On the other hand, there are documents that show\nthat Llull kept his family life at least another decade, which\ncoincides with the period spent on his formation. However, this\nprocess separated him from his family. His wife Blanca would request\nthe legal administration of the family properties due to Llull\u2019s\nincreasingly eremitic life. She was granted her request on May 13,\n1276 (Dominguez Reboiras and Gay\u00e1 2008: 43)\n\nLittle is known about the time following Ramon Llull\u2019s\nconversion, in which he began a period of intense study and\nmeditation. According to De vita coaetanea, after his\npilgrimage, he had decided to travel to Paris to study. Nevertheless,\nhis intentions were not supported either by friends or by relatives\nand he stayed in Majorca.\n\nThe object and means of his studies have been a topic of discussion.\nFor Johnston (1996) it is possible that he studied Latin with private\ntutors, and he might have attended lectures in the colleges of the\nmendicant orders established on the island. According to De vita\ncoaetanea, he learned Arabic from a Muslim slave. In any case,\nLlull does not seem to have received any formal education.\n\nThis process of instruction would end with a retreat to dedicate\nhimself to contemplation and study on Puig de Randa (a mountain in\nMajorca). During this spiritual experience he conceived the method and\nwork, now known as the Ars (Art), with which he\nwould fight \u201cthe errors of the infidels\u201d (De Vita\nI-5). His retirement to Puig de Randa would end with a visit to the\nCistercian Abbey La Real, where he would write a first version of the\nArs, known as Ars compendiosa inveniendi veritatem.\nThis learning period would end with a new meditative stay on the\nmountain for four months until he received a new divine message\nthrough a strange priest who blessed him.\n",
