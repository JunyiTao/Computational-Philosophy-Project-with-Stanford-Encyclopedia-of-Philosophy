The Feder-Garve Review and Kant\u2019s Replies\n\nThe first published review of the Critique of Pure Reason, by\nFeder and Garve (1782), accuses Kant of holding a basically Berkeleyan\nphenomenalist conception of objects in space. Feder and Garve were not\nthe only ones to read Kant as a phenomenalist. The phenomenalist\nreading was so widespread and influential that it became the default\ninterpretation for generations after the publication of the\nCritique. In fact, many of the key figures in German\nphilosophy in 1781 and after (e.g., Mendelssohn, Eberhard, Hamann,\nJacobi, Fichte, Schelling) take the phenomenalist or\n\u201csubjectivist\u201d reading of Kant for granted and think this\nis precisely why Kant must be \u201covercome\u201d. The assumption\nthat Kant is a subjectivist about appearances is a major impetus in\nthe development of German\n idealism.[7]\n\nHowever, the phenomenalist reading of transcendental idealism has been\nchallenged on many fronts, both as an interpretation of Kant and\n(often on the assumption that it is Kant\u2019s view) on its own\nphilosophical merits. This section explores the origin of the\nphenomenalist reading in the Feder-Garve review and its basis in the\ntext of the Critique. The next section provides some reasons\nto think that the phenomenalist reading is more defensible as an\ninterpretation of Kant than is sometimes appreciated. Section 3.4\nexplores influential objections by Kant\u2019s contemporaries to\ntranscendental idealism, on the assumption that the phenomenalist\ninterpretation of that doctrine is correct, which were later taken up\nas criticisms of the phenomenalist interpretation itself.\n Section 4\n introduces a theme explored in greater detail in later sections: the\ndevelopment of non-phenomenalist interpretations of Kant\u2019s\ntranscendental idealism.\n",
