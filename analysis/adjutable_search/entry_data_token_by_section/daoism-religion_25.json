    "main_text": "Gods and Rituals || Rituals\n5.4 Rituals\n\nThe two main Daoist ceremonies in the present day are the Offering\n(jiao) and the Merit (gongde) rituals. (On their\nhistory and on earlier forms of ritual see Benn 2000; Andersen 2008;\nLagerwey 2010: 58\u201393). The Offering ritual (Lagerwey 1987:\n51\u2013167; Schipper 1993: 72\u201399; Dean 2000: 670\u201377) is\nperformed to renovate the bond between a community\u2014from the\nvillage to the empire\u2014and its gods. The Merit ritual (Lagerwey\n1987: 169\u2013237) is a funerary ceremony performed to ensure that\nthe deceased is not kept in the netherworld but may ascend to\nHeaven.\n\nThe communal ritual is requested and organized by the representatives\nof community via the local \u201clay association\u201d, which is\nalso in charge of the local temple or shrine. The main officiant is\nthe Daoist priest, or daoshi (lit. \u201cDaoist\nmaster\u201d), a function typically transmitted within families. When\nhe receives a request to celebrate an Offering, the daoshi\nconvenes his assistants to perform the ritual. The celebration\ntypically lasts one, two, three, five, or ten days, but arrangements\n(especially the preparation of the necessary paperwork) require a much\nlonger time. While the Offering is celebrated in the temple, a\nfestival is performed in the streets outside, with\nprocessions\u2014the statue of the local tutelary god is carried\nthrough the neighborhood\u2014music, and theatrical performances. In\naddition to this dual \u201couter\u201d and \u201cinner\u201d\naspect of the celebration, another important distinction is the one\nbetween the portions of the ritual that are public and those that are performed\nbehind closed doors, in which only the priests and selected representatives of the\nlocal community can participate.\n",
