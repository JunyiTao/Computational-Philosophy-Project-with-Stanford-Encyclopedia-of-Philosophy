    "main_text": "Problems and Prospects for Reism\n3. Problems and Prospects for Reism\n\n\nReism had to meet several serious problems. It was very soon observed\nthat (R2), one of the most important theses of reism, contained\napparent names \u2018state of affairs\u2019, \u2018relation\u2019\nand \u2018property\u2019. Hence, it should be disqualified as\nmeaningless by reistic standards. In order to cope with this\nobjection, Kotarbi\u0144ski sharply distinguished semantic reism and\nontological reism. He gradually ascribed a greater importance to\nsemantic issues. For example, he was inclined to consider (R2) as a\nstatement about the reistic language, that is, providing the condition\nfor which names are admissible in our language. Another difficult\nproblem came from various special fields and concerned the reistic\ninterpretation of mathematics, logic, semantics, psychology sociology\nand the humanities. How should a reistic interpretation of set theory\nbe presented? Is the concept of meaning explainable reistically? How\nshould psyche, social rules or pieces of art be understood in the\nreistic frameworks? Kotarbi\u0144ski hoped that mereology would\nprovide a reistic alternative of set theory. He also offered a partial\nsolution to other difficulties, but he finally recognized that the\nsuccesses of reism were very partial. At the last stage,\nKotarbi\u0144ski considered reism rather as a program than as a theory\nof the world and language.  However, he always stressed that every\nform of progress in reism, even regional or local, is a cognitive\nsuccess, because it introduces a language which is free of the dangers\nthat result from using abstract words. In spite of these difficulties,\nreism attracted many philosophers, mainly in Poland.  Perhaps\nTarski is the most notable example. He expressed sympathy for\nreism and even translated one of Kotarbi\u0144ski\u2019s papers into\nEnglish, but he used Platonistic methods in his works on the\nfoundations of mathematics.\n",
