Concluding Remarks\n\n\nThe diversity of the conceptual issues discussed in this entry\npreclude any compelling general conclusions to be drawn at this stage\nof the development of the philosophy of ecology. Even the defense of\nreductionism in ecology using IBMs can with so many attendant\nqualifiers that it cannot be regarded as an unequivocal endorsement.\nThat GIS models seem to introduce a new type of visual representation\nin the sciences is another conclusion that requires similar\nqualification and further scrutiny before it is accepted. It should\nalso be clear from the preceding discussion that ecology may\nprovide a fertile ground for the exploration of concepts of complexity\nand systematicity that have recently begun to engage philosophers and\nscientists\n alike.[99]\n\n\nHowever, the inability to draw general philosophical conclusions about\necology is at least as much due to the relative lack of philosophical\nscrutiny of ecology as it is due to the nature of the subject. Even\nwithin the philosophy of biology, ecology has received little\nattention compared to other sub-disciplines of biology, especially\nevolution, and, lately,\n development.[100]\n Ecology deserves better. As this entry has emphasized, there are many\nfoundational and conceptual issues within ecology that can be\nclarified and better framed through carefully philosophical\nanalysis. The diversity-stability problem is exemplary in this\nrespect.  The relevance of ecology to human well-being and\nbiodiversity should also be obvious\u2014 see\n conservation biology\n and\n environmental ethics.\n But, even leaving aside these narrower considerations, ecology\nprovides ample opportunity to illuminate general questions about many\nof the traditional themes of the philosophy of science: complexity,\ncontingency, holism, lawlikeness, reductionism, representation,\netc. This entry is an invitation to philosophers to take an active\ninterest in ecology.\n",
