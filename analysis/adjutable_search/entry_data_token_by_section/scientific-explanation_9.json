    "main_text": "The SR Model || Causation and Statistical Relevance Relationships\n3.4 Causation and Statistical Relevance Relationships\n\nPutting aside the issues raised in the previous section, the SR model\nembodies several generic assumptions of ongoing philosophical\ninterest. In particular the model assumes that (i) explanations must\ncite causal relationships and that (ii) causal relationships are fully\ncaptured by statistical relevance (or conditional dependence and\nindependence) relationships. While (i) is a matter of current\ncontroversy, (ii) is clearly false. As a substantial body of\n work[5]\n has made clear, causal relationships are greatly underdetermined by\nstatistical relevance relationships, even given additional\nassumptions. For example, a structure in which B is a common\ncause of the joint effects A and C implies (assuming the\nCausal Markov assumption which is the appropriate generalization of\nSalmon\u2019s assumptions connecting causation and probability)\nimplies the same statistical relevance relations as a chain structure\nin which A causes B which causes C. \n\nSelected Readings. Salmon (1971a) provides a detailed\nstatement and defense of the SR model. This essay, as well as\npapers by Jeffrey (1969) and Greeno (1970) which defend views broadly\nsimilar to the SR model, are collected in Salmon (1971b).\nAdditional discussion of the model as well as a more recent\ncharacterization of \u201cobjective homogeneity\u201d can be found\nin Salmon (1984). Cartwright (1979) contains some influential\ncriticisms of the SR model. Theorems specifying the precise\nextent of the underdetermination of causal claims by evidence about\nstatistical relevance relationships can be found in Spirtes, Glymour\nand Scheines (1993 [2000: chapter 4]). For additional discussion of\n\u201cscreening off\u201d and the principle of the common cause, see\nthe entry on\n Reichenbach\u2019s Principle of the Common Cause.\n",
