Schaffner 1993; Place 1956, 1960).\nThe most elaborate version of this assumption forms part of\nCausey\u2019s more general picture of scientific unification.\nIntuitively, and abstracting away from numerous details of his\nelaborate model (described in terms of theory-reduction), a\nmicro-reduction in Causey\u2019s sense relies on an identification of\na property P1 with a property\nP2, where the syntactical arrangement of the terms\nforming the complex term \u2018P2\u2019 reflect\nthe mereological composition of P1, whereas\n\u2018P1\u2019 does not.\n\u2018P1\u2019 simply refers to the whole\nwithout explicitly referring to its parts as\n\u2018P2\u2019 does, but they in fact refer to\nthe same complex. Whereas mereological relations alone are compatible\nwith emergentist or dualist interpretations combining mereological\ncomposition and identity seems to ensure a link strong enough to count\nas a reductive link.\n\nAnother way of connecting reduction to composition is this: one could\ntry to describe reduction as a one-many relation. In one use of the\nterm \u2018composes\u2019, a given object a may be composed\nout of several objects b1, b2,\nb3 \u2026 bn. At\nleast at the face of it, there is nothing in the use of\n\u2018reduction\u2019 that should prevent us from, say, stating that\na whole reduces to its parts.\n\nAt the same time, it is not clear how tying reduction to mereology\ncould deal with cases like this: Iron reduces Fe\n(the chemical structure kind). Both expressions, \u2018iron\u2019\nand \u2018Fe\u2019, are syntactically simple. More importantly,\n\u2018Fe\u2019 does not present us with Iron-atoms as\ncomposed wholes. Similarly, the often-used example of pain and C-fiber\nfiring does not match this idea.\n\nMoreover, this move would come at the price of building a sort of\natomistic materialism into the very notion of reduction; if we were to\ndefine reduction in mereological terms, it would be conceptually\nimpossible that parts reduce to the whole they form. However, it seems\npossible (though, in the light of science, maybe highly unlikely) that\nin some cases parts do not exist over and above the whole they form.\nSuch was the view of certain historical varieties of holistic idealism\n(see for example entry on\n F.H. Bradley),\n and some have argued it is true of quantum systems including\nentangled particles (Silberstein 1999). Thus if we were to tie the\nnotion of reduction to mereology, it would not be general enough to\ncapture the full range of possible reductionist positions.\n\nFinally, mereological relations are usually regarded as being\ninstantiated by concrete objects and the wholes they form. A\nderivative notion can be defined for properties via reference to\nmereological relations between their instances. However, it is not\nclear how this could extend to events or event-types. Thus\ninterpreting reduction as a matter of mereology might prevent us from\napplying it to events and deprive us of a fully general notion of\nreduction.\n",
