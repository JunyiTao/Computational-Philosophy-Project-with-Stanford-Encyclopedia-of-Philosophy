International Criminal Law and Punishment\n\nTheoretical discussions of criminal punishment and its justification\ntypically focus on criminal punishment in the context of domestic\ncriminal law. But a theory of punishment must also have something to\nsay about its rationale and justification in the context of\ninternational criminal law: about how we should understand, and\nwhether and how we can justify, the punishments imposed by such\ntribunals as the International Criminal Court. For we cannot assume\nthat a normative theory of domestic criminal punishment can simply be\nread across into the context of international criminal law (see Drumbl\n2007). Rather, the imposition of punishment in the international\ncontext raises distinctive conceptual and normative issues.\n\nOne key question is which crimes rise to the level of\n\u2018international crimes\u2019 and are thus rightly subject to\nprosecution and punishment by international rather than domestic\ninstitutions. One prominent answer to this question (May 2005) holds\nthat when a state fails to assure its citizens\u2019 safety and\nsecurity, it thus has no right to prevent international bodies from\ninfringing its sovereignty. Such international intervention is only\njustified, however, in cases of serious harm to the international\ncommunity, or to humanity as a whole. Crimes harm humanity as a whole,\non this account, when they are group-based either in the sense that\nthey are based on group characteristics of the victims or are\nperpetrated by a state or another group agent. Such as account has\nbeen subject to challenge focused on its harm-based account of crime\n(Renzo 2012) and its claim that group-based crimes harm humanity as a\nwhole (A. Altman 2006). One response to this sort of account, then, is\nto reject the international harm requirement and to contend, instead,\nthat a state\u2019s failure to protect its members\u2019 rights is\nsufficient to justify international intervention (Altman and Wellman\n2004), or that international criminal tribunals can be justified if\nthey provide fair procedures for trials and punishments in response to\nsufficiently heinous crimes (Luban 2010).\n\nWe might think, by contrast, that the heinousness of a crime or the\nexistence of fair legal procedures is not enough. We also need some\nrelational account of why the international legal community \u2014\nrather than this or that domestic legal entity \u2014 has standing to\ncall perpetrators of genocide or crimes against humanity to account:\nthat is, why the offenders are answerable to the international\ncommunity (see Duff 2010). For claims of standing to be legitimate,\nthey must be grounded in some shared normative community that includes\nthe perpetrators themselves as well as those on behalf of whom the\ninternational legal community calls the perpetrators to account. (For\nother discussions of jurisdiction to prosecute and punish\ninternational crimes, see W. Lee 2010; Wellman 2011; Giudice and\nSchaeffer 2012; Davidovic 2015.)\n\nAnother important question is how international institutions should\nassign responsibility for crimes such as genocide, which are\nperpetrated by groups rather than by individuals acting alone. (Such\nquestions arise in the domestic context as well, with respect to\ncorporations, but the magnitude of crimes such as genocide makes the\nquestions especially poignant at the international level.) The\nNuremberg Tribunal articulated what has since become the governing\nview in international criminal law: \u2018Crimes against\ninternational law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and\nonly by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the\nprovisions of international law be enforced\u2019 (International\nMilitary Tribunal 1947). Several scholars in recent years have\nsuggested, however, that rather than focusing only on prosecuting and\npunishing members of the groups responsible for mass atrocities, it\nmay sometimes be preferable to prosecute and punish the entire group\nqua group. A worry for such proposals is that, because punishment\ncharacteristically involves the imposition of burdens, punishment of\nan entire group risks inflicting punitive burdens on innocent members\nof the group: those who were nonparticipants in the crime, or perhaps\neven worked against it or were among its victims. In response to this\nconcern, defenders of the idea of collective punishment have suggested\nthat it need not distribute among the members of the group (see\nErskine 2011; Pasternak 2011; Tanguagy-Renaud 2013; but see Hoskins\n2014b), or that the benefits of such punishment may be valuable enough\nto override concerns about harm to innocents (see Lang 2007: 255).\n",
