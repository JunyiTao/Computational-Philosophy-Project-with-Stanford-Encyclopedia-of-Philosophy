Perhaps the earliest effective\nmethods to be utilized were rules-of-thumb (as Turing called them) for\narithmetical calculations of various sorts, but whatever their humble\nbeginnings, the scope of effective methods has widened dramatically\nover the centuries. In the Middle Ages, the Catalan philosopher\n Llull\n envisaged an effective method for posing and answering questions\nabout the attributes of God, the nature of the soul, the nature of\ngoodness, and other fundamental issues. Three hundred years later, in\nthe seventeenth century, Hobbes was asserting that human reasoning\nprocesses amount to nothing more than (essentially arithmetical)\neffective procedures:\n\n\nBy reasoning I understand computation. (Hobbes 1655 [1839]: ch. 1\nsect. 2)\n\n\nNowadays, effective methods\u2014algorithms\u2014are the basis for\nevery job that electronic computers do. According to some computer\nscientists, advances in the design of effective methods will soon\nusher in human-level artificial intelligence, followed by superhuman\nintelligence. Already, virtual assistants such as Siri, Cortana and\nChatGPT implement effective methods that produce useful answers to a\nwide range of questions.\n\nIn its most sublimely general form, the Entscheidungsproblem is the\nproblem of designing an effective general-purpose question-answerer,\nan effective method that is capable of giving the correct answer, yes\nor no, to any meaningful scientific question, and perhaps\neven ethical and metaphysical questions too. The idea of such a method\nis almost jaw-dropping. Llull seems to have glimpsed the concept of a\ngeneral question-answering method, writing in approximately 1300 of a\ngeneral art (\u201cars\u201d), or technique, \u201cby\nmeans of which one may know in regard to all natural things\u201d\n(Lo Desconhort, line 8, in Llull 1986: 99). He dreamed of an\nars generalis (general technique) that could mechanize the\n\u201cone general science, with its own general principles in which\nthe principles of other sciences would be implicit\u201d (Preface to\nArs Generalis Ultima, in Llull 1645 [1970: 1]). Llull used\ncircumscribed fields of knowledge to illustrate his idea of a\nmechanical question-answerer, designing small domain-specific machines\nconsisting of superimposed discs; possibly his machines took the form\nof a parchment volvelle, a relative of the metal\nastrolabe.\n\nIn early modern times, Llull\u2019s idea of the ars\ngeneralis received a sympathetic discussion in Leibniz\u2019s\nwritings.\n",
