    "main_text": "Solidarity in Practice || Solidarity in social movements\n2.5 Solidarity in social movements\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the predominant context in which\nsolidarity has had a place are modern social movements, such as\nanticolonial, black, feminist, LGBTQ, and disabled struggles. It would\ntake us too far afield to review how solidarity is deployed in each\none of these movements. But it useful to give a sense of the kind of\nquestions that have motivated those engaged in them. One of the\ncentral questions is the following: What should the basis of\nthe black, anticolonial, women\u2019s movements, and so on, be?\nShould, for example, the women\u2019s movement be grounded in an idea\nof sisterhood\u2014on what unites women as women\u2014or on\na commitment to the (feminist) cause (or both, or neither)? Should\nblack solidarity (for example in the US) be based in a shared\nethnocultural identity as a nation, or in common subjection to\noppression (or both, or neither)? Should Indigenous anti-colonial\nmovements in Canada be grounded in particular territorially-based\nshared ways of life, or in broader commitments to overthrowing\nEuropean colonialism wherever it exists (or both, or neither)? (see,\ne.g., Coulthard 2014; Simpson 2017). To give a sense of the debates,\nwe will focus on black solidarity and the idea of sisterhood.\n\nShould solidarity among women as women be grounded in some\nkind of shared experience of womanhood? It has become a staple of the\nfeminist literature that there is no shared experience of\nsimply being a woman. The attempt to identify a canonical list of\nexperiences that characterizes \u201cbeing a woman\u201d is likely\nto lead to subtle forms of exclusion. Previous such attempts, it is\noften argued, have reproduced the cis-gendered experiences of white,\nmiddle-class women, and have marginalized the experiences of women\nwhose experiences do not fit on the list (Lorde 1984; Hill Collins\n1990 [2000]; hooks 2000 [2015]; Combahee River Collective 1977/1983;\nSpelman 1988). See also entry on\n feminist perspectives on sex and gender.\n\nThe alternative to grounding sisterhood in shared experience or shared\noppression is to ground it in commitment to a cause or\ncoalition against patriarchy. The trouble with this view is\nthat it leaves open the question of how this defines a distinctive\nform of sisterhood, rather than a form of feminist\nsolidarity. But is there anything distinctive about solidarity among\nwomen as women? If so, what are its grounds?\n\nOne response is to ground sisterhood not in a shared\nexperience but in a shared condition of\noppression\u2014where that condition is experienced in different ways\naccording to one\u2019s overall structural position (which may be\nfurther influenced by intersecting factors, such as race, class,\nsexuality, and religion) (see, e.g., Young 1994).\n\nThis possible response to the challenge from exclusion invites a\nfurther objection: if sisterhood is supposed to be grounded in a\nshared condition defined by relations to a given set of socially\nconditioned material objects (primarily the socially sexed body and\nits reproductive functions), then doesn\u2019t this also exclude? If\nthis is supposed to ground an identification among women as women,\nthen doesn\u2019t sisterhood required constructing a shared narrative\nregarding what these relations are how they condition the sexed body?\n(Shrage 2009) But then doesn\u2019t this just reinvite the challenge\nfrom exclusion, since different women\u2014depending on their\nstructural position\u2014will find themselves subordinated and\noppressed by a different conglomeration of socially salient relations\nand practices? Think, for example, of transgender women, or the\nvariety of ways in which race, sexuality, class, gender, and religion\n intersect.[10]\n\n\nSimilar questions arise when considering the nature of Black\n(American) solidarity. Should such solidarity be grounded in a shared\nethnocultural identity, in a shared condition as oppressed, in an\nanti-racist cause as such, or in something else again (such as a\nshared fate)? (These grounds are not, of course, exclusive: one might\nbelieve that black solidarity should be grounded in both\nethnocultural identity and in the sense of sharing a distinct\ncondition of oppression.) An important strand of black\nnationalism\u2014one that was especially prominent in the1960s and\n70s\u2014holds that high-sounding appeals to the possibility of\nintegration in the name of a universal fight against injustice cannot\nground a robust solidarity among blacks. A deeper, widespread\nengagement with a distinct culture is needed. According to this form\nof nationalism, Black Americans (as descendants of slaves violently\nabducted from Africa and elsewhere) constitute a distinct, and\ndistinctly cultural, nation-within-a-nation (Robinson 2001; Moses\n1978). Nationalists argue that, though at the moment marginalized and\ndivided within itself, black culture calls for development and\nexpression (for example, in the arts, music, literature, and theatre)\n(Cruse 1967); without it, and the sense of collective identity and\npride it secures, blacks cannot securely win their freedom in a\nfundamentally hostile American society (see, e.g., Malcolm X 1970\n[1992]; cf. Rivers 1995).\n\nMany black liberals demur: while black cultural, economic, social,\ncultural and political autonomy can be, in certain circumstances,\nstrategically useful in the fight against anti-black racism, it is\nwrong-headed to insist on cultural unity as the basis of black\nsolidarity. Insisting on cultural unity is divisive and unnecessarily\nexclusionary given the broad diversity of ethnic and social\nbackgrounds in the black community. Black solidarity should be\ngrounded, instead, on \u201cthin\u201d blackness, namely on shared\nexperiences of anti-black racism (see, e.g., Shelby 2005: 245; Hill\nCollins 1990 [2000]; cf. Gooding-Williams 2009).\n",
