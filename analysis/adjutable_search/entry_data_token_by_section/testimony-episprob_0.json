Reductionism and Non-Reductionism\n\nConsider this scenario: Your friend testifies to you that your\nfavorite team won last night\u2019s game (= p). Because you\nknow that your friend is a highly reliable sports reporter, and\nbecause you have no reason to doubt what she says on this occasion,\nyou believe what you are told. In this case, your belief that p\nis clearly justified.\n\nNow, contrast that scenario with this one: You run into a stranger\nwhom you have never met and they tell you that your favorite team won\nlast night\u2019s game (= p). Even though you don\u2019t know\nif this person often speaks the truth, you also don\u2019t have any\ngood reason to doubt what they are telling you. Thus, you decide to\nbelieve what you are told. Whether or not your belief that p is\njustified in this case is a lot less clear.\n\nThinking about the difference between cases like these helps motivate\nthe debate about the following question:\n\n\nFirst Big Question: Is testimony a basic source of\njustification, or can testimonial justification be reduced to a\ncombination of other epistemic sources?\n\n\nThose who defend answers to this question tend to endorse one of three\nmain positions: Reductionism, Non-Reductionism, and\nHybrid Views.\n",
