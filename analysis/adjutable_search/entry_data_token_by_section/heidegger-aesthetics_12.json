    "main_text": "Heidegger for Art, Introduction:  The Three Pillars of Heidegger\u2019s Understanding of Art || Back to the Future:  Heidegger on the Essence of Art\n3.1 Back to the Future:  Heidegger on the Essence of Art\n\n\nHeidegger\u2019s introduction of \u201ca well-known painting by\nVan Gogh, who painted such shoes several times\u201d (PLT 33/GA5 18),\nis notoriously abrupt and puzzling to many readers. The path that\nleads Heidegger to Van Gogh\u2019s painting should not be too\nsurprising, however, because it is the same path we have been following\nhere. Looking back at \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\ntwo years later (in 1938), Heidegger will write that:\n\n\nThe question of the origin of the work of art does not aim to set\nout a timelessly valid determination of the essence of artwork which\ncould also serve as the guiding thread for an historically\nretrospective clarification of the history of art. The question\nis most intimately connected with the task of overcoming aesthetics,\nwhich also means overcoming a certain conception of entities as what\nare objectively representable. (CP 354/GA65\n 503)[39]\n\n\nWe have seen that because aesthetics tries to describe artworks as\nobjects that express and intensify human subjects\u2019 experiences of\nlife, the aesthetic approach begins \u201calways already\u201d too\nlate. Modern aesthetics presupposes the perspective of a subject\nconfronting an external object and thereby misses the way art works\ninconspicuously in the background of human existence to shape and\ntransform our sense of what is and what matters.\n\n\nHeidegger expands this critique to include\n\u201crepresentation\u201d here because representations are what\nmodern philosophy typically uses to try to bridge the divide Descartes\nopened between subjects and objects. (The objective world\nallegedly \u201cexternal\u201d to subjectivity gets duplicated in\nminiature, as it were, and \u201cre-presented\u201d to the\nmind\u2014as in the famous Cartesian picture of consciousness as an\ninternal \u201ctheater of representations.\u201d) Of course,\nHeidegger does not deny that representations sometimes mediate our\nexperience of the world. What he denies is that representations\ngo \u201call the way down,\u201d that they plumb the depths of\nexistence. Instead, representations presuppose a level of\nexistence they cannot explain. Heidegger\u2019s fundamental\nphenomenological critique of the modern theoretical picture is that it\noverlooks and then cannot recapture the more basic level of engaged\nexistence, a practical coping with equipment in which no subject/object\ndichotomy has yet opened up because self and world remain integrally\nentwined and mutually\n determining.[40]\nThis primordial level of engaged\nexistence, we will see, is what Heidegger thinks Van Gogh\u2019s\npainting allows us to encounter and understand in a way that no mere\naesthetic representation ever could. In so doing, Heidegger\nthinks, Van Gogh\u2019s painting allows us to encounter the very\nessence of art.\n\n\nOn the basis of passages like the one above, however, some\ninterpreters claim that \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d\ndoes not seek to \u201cuncover the essence of art,\u201d but that\nis\n misleading.[41]\nAs Heidegger says, his essay does not\nseek to set out one \u201ctimelessly valid determination\u201d of the\nessence of art which would apply retrospectively to the entire history\nof art, but that is only because he does not understand essences the\nway they have been understood from Plato to Kripke, namely, as\n\u201ctimelessly valid determinations\u201d of what something\n is.[42]\nIn fact,\n\u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art\u201d does attempt to uncover and\ncommunicate art\u2019s historical \u201cessence,\u201d by which\nHeidegger means that structure which allows art to reveal itself in\ndifferent ways as it unfolds in the human understanding across\ntime. What is confusing for many readers is that this historical\nessence of art is not some substance underlying the different forms of\nart or even a fixed property that would enable us to distinguish art\nfrom non-art but, instead, an insubstantial and ever-changing\n\u201cessential strife\u201d that is built into the structure of all\nintelligibility (the structure whereby entities become intelligible as\nentities), as we will\n see.[43]\n\n\nRather than forcing Heidegger to develop an entire art history, the\nnormative demands of his critical project only require him to focus on\ntwo crucial historical moments in Western humanity\u2019s changing\nhistorical understanding of art\u2014a kind of before and after, as it\nwere, which contrasts the fullness of what has been possible with the\nnarrowness of what is currently actual. Heidegger is thus\nprimarily concerned to show, first, how the ancient Greeks encountered\nart in a non-aesthetic way (and so enshrined it in their temples), and\nsecond, how art is typically understood and experienced by us late\nmoderns, who remain caught in the grip of modern aesthetics and so\nunder the influence of \u201cmodern subjectivism\u201d (PLT 76/GA5\n63). As subjectivism\u2019s unlimited ambition to establish\n\u201cmastery over the totality of what-is\u201d (QCT 132/GA5 92)\nworks to objectify even modernity\u2019s vaunted subject, moreover, it\nincreasingly transforms modern subjectivism into late-modern\n\u201cenframing\u201d (as we saw in 2.7).\n\n\nIn \u201cThe Origin of the Work of Art,\u201d Heidegger suggests\nthat modern subjectivism and late-modern enframing can be understood as\nsymptoms of Western humanity\u2019s continuing inability to accept our\ndefining existential finitude. The limitless ambition of our\nsubjectivist quest to master all reality conceptually results from our\nrefusal to own up to, make peace with, and find non-nihilistic ways to\naffirm the tragic truth Heidegger gleans from the ancients:\n\n\nMuch of what is cannot be brought under the rule of humanity.\nOnly a little becomes known. What is known remains approximate;\nwhat is mastered remains unstable. What-is is never something\n[entirely] man-made or even only a representation, as it can all too\neasily appear. (PLT 53/GA5 39)\n\n\nHeidegger takes off here from the second choral ode in Sophocles\u2019\nAntigone (which he discussed at length in 1935\u2019s\nIntroduction to Metaphysics). For Sophocles\u2019\nTheban elders, the one thing humanity cannot master is death. For\nHeidegger, thinking about death opens us up to the terrifyingly\n\u201cawesome\u201d insight that the known rests on the unknown, the\nmastered on the unmastered, like a small ship floating on a deep and\nstormy \u201csea\u201d (IM 159, 164/GA40 159,\n 162).[44]\nWe like to believe that\nhumanity is well on its way to mastering the universe, but art teaches\nus that we are far from having exhausted the possibilities inherent in\nintelligibility.\n\n\nYet, rather than leading us into despair over our essential human\nfinitude (the fact that we will never master the totality of what-is),\nart helps us learn to embrace this finitude by reminding us of its\nother side, namely, the fact that intelligibility will never exhaust\nits source. For, it remains possible for being to continue to\nbecome newly intelligible only if it cannot ever become fully\nintelligible. Art thus teaches us to embrace the insight that\nmeanings will never be exhausted as precisely what makes it possible\nfor us to continue to discover new meanings, and in this way art helps\nus see that human finitude is not something we should despair over or\nseek to deny though compensatory subjectivistic fantasies (of complete control or finally complete systems). Of\ncourse, the claim that we should give up thinking we could ever know\neverything does not entail that we should give up trying to know new\nthings\u2014quite the contrary. If the heroic is what helps us\naffirm and thereby transform the tragic (as the famous speech by\nSarp\u00eadon in Homer\u2019s Iliad suggests), then\nHeidegger\u2019s thinking about art is heroic: Art teaches us to\nembrace the initially tragic insight that being will never be\ncompletely revealed in time as the very thing that makes it possible\nfor human beings to continue to understand what-is in new and\npotentially more meaningful ways.\n\n\nIn sum, the point of Heidegger\u2019s juxtaposition of modern\nspleen and ancient ideal is not to call for the impossible revival of\nthe lost Greek past but, rather, to help motivate a new, post-aesthetic\nunderstanding of what art could still mean for us, now and in the\nfuture. If, instead of trying to obtain a kind of cognitive\nmastery over art through aesthetics\u2014or using aesthetics to extend\nour late-modern understanding of all that is as\nintrinsically-meaningless resources standing by to be\noptimized\u2014we simply allow ourselves to experience what is\nhappening within a great work of art, then Heidegger thinks we will be\nable to encounter the \u201cessential strife\u201d in which the true\nwork of art paradoxically \u201crests\u201d and finds its\n\u201crepose.\u201d When we encounter the\n\u201cmovement\u201d that paradoxically rests in the masterful\n\u201ccomposure\u201d of a great artwork, moreover, what we discover\ntherein is an \u201cinstability\u201d that underlies the entire\nintelligible order, an ontological tension (between revealing and\nconcealing, emerging and withdrawing) which can never be permanently\nstabilized and thus remains even in what is\n \u201cmastered.\u201d[45]\nIndeed,\nwhat is truly mastered artistically, Heidegger suggests, is what\nsomehow captures, preserves, and communicates this tension in the\nstructure of intelligibility, allowing us to encounter and understand\nthis essential tension in a way that helps us learn to transcend the\nlimits of our modern and late-modern ways of understanding what beings\nare.\n",
