    "main_text": "Politics || How political is Characteristicks?\n5.1 How political is Characteristicks?\n\nIn recent years, a number of commentators have highlighted\nShaftesbury\u2019s political commitments and their role in his\nphilosophy. Klein (1994) was one of the earliest and most developed\nattempts to chart the political in Shaftesbury\u2019s thought. Jaffro\n(2018), M\u00fcller (2018), Jost (2018), and Axelsson (2019,\n223\u201338) have made similar points (see also Williams 2005, 234).\nShaftesbury was, of course, the grandson of the first Earl of\nShaftesbury, and the family was strongly associated with the Whig\nParty. Shaftesbury himself (when he was Lord Ashley) was a Whig member\nof the House of Commons from 1695\u20131698. After his father\u2019s\ndeath in 1699 he assumed the Earldom and entered the House of Lords,\nwhile continuing to play a role in Whig electoral efforts of 1701\n(and, to a lesser extent, of 1705).\n\nKlein argues that Characteristicks was largely motivated by\nShaftesbury\u2019s anti-Tory politics. Klein highlights\nShaftesbury\u2019s endorsement of the 1688 revolution, of religious\ntoleration, of a balance of power between Parliament and monarch,\nand\u2014most centrally\u2014of extensive liberty. Klein says that\nShaftesbury\u2019s goal \u201cwas a program of education in which\nthe moral and literary would be combined to produce virtuous public\naction. Shaftesbury was designing a Whiggism that was civic and\nhumanist.\u201d Klein argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s discussion of\n\u201cimposture\u201d in A Letter concerning Enthusiasm was\nan attack on Tory religious views. Klein also cites a 1710 letter in\nwhich Shaftesbury says that in the third volume of\nCharacteristicks he intended \u201cto attack and provoke a\nmost malignant party,\u201d and goes on to express the hope that his\nwork will destroy that party\u2019s hold on English academics,\nreligion, and culture (Regimen 432).\n\nJaffro (2018) argues that Shaftesbury takes \u201cbalance\u201d to\nbe the ideal of both a political constitution and a human\u2019s\npsychological make-up. And Jaffro argues the value Shaftesbury places\non balance is an implicit commitment to Harrington\u2019s political\nprogram in The Commonwealth of Oceana.\n\nJost (2018) and M\u00fcller (2018) both find esoteric political\nmessages in Shaftesbury\u2019s work. According to Jost,\nShaftesbury\u2019s exhortation to of divide oneself into two for\nself-reflection is an implicit endorsement of the Whig party over the\nTories. M\u00fcller argues that Shaftesbury\u2019s attack on religion\nbased on selfish reward in the afterlife is an implicit attack on Tory\ntyranny.\n\nQuestions have been raised about how political in general and partisan\nin particular Shaftesbury\u2019s Characteristicks is (Gill\n2020). Shaftesbury seems at times to be repudiating partisanship,\narguing for an identification with all people that rises above\npolitical squabbles. Many of his central positions on beauty and\nmorality may not involve any clear political commitments. And while in\nsome letters Shaftesbury vociferously attacks Tories, in others he\nclaims that he doesn\u2019t think of himself as powerfully aligned\nwith any political party (Regimen 366\u201367).\n",
