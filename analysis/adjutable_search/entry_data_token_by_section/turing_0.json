    "main_text": "Outline of Life\n1. Outline of Life\n\n\nAlan Turing's short and extraordinary life has attracted wide interest.\nIt has inspired his mother's memoir (E. S. Turing 1959), a detailed\nbiography (Hodges 1983), a play and television film (Whitemore 1986),\nand various other works of fiction and art. \n\n\nThere are many reasons for this interest, but one is that in every\nsphere of his life and work he made unexpected connections between\napparently unrelated areas. His central contribution to science and\nphilosophy came through his treating the subject of symbolic logic as a\nnew branch of applied mathematics, giving it a physical and engineering\ncontent. Unwilling or unable to remain within any standard role or\ndepartment of thought, Alan Turing continued a life full of\nincongruity. Though a shy, boyish, man, he had a pivotal role in world\nhistory through his role in Second World War cryptology. Though the\nfounder of the dominant technology of the twentieth century, he\nvariously impressed, charmed or disturbed people with his unworldly\ninnocence and his dislike of moral or intellectual compromise.\n\n\nAlan Mathison Turing was born in London, 23 June 1912, to\nupper-middle-class British parents. His schooling was of a traditional\nkind, dominated by the British imperial system, but from earliest life\nhis fascination with the scientific impulse\u2014expressed by him as\nfinding the \u2018commonest in nature\u2019\u2014found him at odds\nwith authority. His scepticism, and disrespect for worldly values, were\nnever tamed and became ever more confidently eccentric. His moody\nhumour swung between gloom and vivacity. His life was also notable as\nthat of a gay man with strong emotions and a growing insistence on his\nidentity.\n\n\nHis first true home was at King's College, Cambridge University,\nnoted for its progressive intellectual life centred on J. M. Keynes.\nTuring studied mathematics with increasing distinction and was elected\na Fellow of the college in 1935. This appointment was followed by a\nremarkable and sudden d\u00e9but in an area where he was an unknown\nfigure: that of mathematical logic. The paper \u201cOn Computable\nNumbers\u2026\u201d (Turing 1936\u20137) was his first and perhaps greatest\ntriumph. It gave a definition of computation and an absolute limitation\non what computation could achieve, which makes it the founding work of\nmodern computer science. It led him to Princeton for more advanced work\nin logic and other branches of mathematics. He had the opportunity to\nremain in the United States, but chose to return to Britain in 1938,\nand was immediately recruited for the British communications war.\n\n\nFrom 1939 to 1945 Turing was almost totally engaged in the mastery\nof the German enciphering machine, Enigma, and other cryptological\ninvestigations at now-famous Bletchley Park, the British government's\nwartime communications headquarters. Turing made a unique logical\ncontribution to the decryption of the Enigma and became the chief\nscientific figure, with a particular responsibility for reading the\nU-boat communications. As such he became a top-level figure in\nAnglo-American liaison, and also gained exposure to the most advanced\nelectronic technology of the day.\n\n\nCombining his ideas from mathematical logic, his experience in\ncryptology, and some practical electronic knowledge, his ambition, at\nthe end of the war in Europe, was to create an electronic computer in\nthe full modern sense. His plans, commissioned by the National Physical\nLaboratory, London, were overshadowed by the more powerfully supported\nAmerican projects. Turing also laboured under the disadvantage that his\nwartime achievements remained totally secret. His ideas led the field\nin 1946, but this was little recognised. Frustrated in his work, he\nemerged as a powerful marathon runner, and almost qualified for the\nBritish team in the 1948 Olympic games.\n\n\nTuring's motivations were scientific rather than industrial or\ncommercial, and he soon returned to the theoretical limitations of\ncomputation, this time focussing on the comparison of the power of\ncomputation and the power of the human brain. His contention was that\nthe computer, when properly programmed, could rival the brain. It\nfounded the \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 program of coming\ndecades.\n\n\nIn 1948 he moved to Manchester University, where he partly fulfilled\nthe expectations placed upon him to plan software for the pioneer\ncomputer development there, but still remained a free-ranging thinker.\nIt was here that his famous 1950 paper, \u201cComputing Machinery and\nIntelligence,\u201d (Turing 1950b) was written. In 1951 he was elected a\nFellow of the Royal Society for his 1936 achievement, yet at the same\ntime he was striking into entirely new territory with a mathematical\ntheory of biological morphogenesis (Turing 1952).\n\n\nThis work was interrupted by Alan Turing's arrest in February 1952\nfor his sexual affair with a young Manchester man, and he was obliged,\nto escape imprisonment, to undergo the injection of oestrogen intended\nto negate his sexual drive. He was disqualified from continuing secret\ncryptological work. His general libertarian attitude was enhanced\nrather than suppressed by the criminal trial, and his intellectual\nindividuality also remained as lively as ever. While remaining formally\na Reader in the Theory of Computing, he not only embarked on more\nambitious applications of his biological theory, but advanced new ideas\nfor fundamental physics.\n\n\nFor this reason his death, on 7 June 1954, at his home in Wilmslow,\nCheshire, came as a general surprise. In hindsight it is obvious that\nTuring's unique status in Anglo-American secret communication work\nmeant that there were pressures on him of which his contemporaries were\nunaware; there was certainly another \u2018security\u2019 conflict\nwith government in 1953 (Hodges 1983, p. 483). Some commentators, e.g.\nDawson (1985), have argued that assassination should not be ruled out.\nBut he had spoken of suicide, and his death, which was by cyanide\npoisoning, was most likely by his own hand, contrived so as to allow\nthose who wished to do so to believe it a result of his penchant for\nchemistry experiments. The symbolism of its dramatic element\u2014a\npartly eaten apple\u2014has continued to haunt the intellectual Eden\nfrom which Alan Turing was expelled.\n",
