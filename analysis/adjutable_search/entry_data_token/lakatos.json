He was notable for his anti-formalist philosophy of\nmathematics (where \u201cformalism\u201d is not just the philosophy\nof Hilbert and his followers but also comprises logicism and\nintuitionism) and for his \u201cMethodology of Scientific Research\nProgrammes\u201d or MSRP, a radical revision of Popper\u2019s\nDemarcation Criterion between science and non-science which gave rise\nto a novel theory of scientific rationality.\n\nAlthough he lived and worked in London, rising to the post of\nProfessor of Logic at the London School of Economics (LSE), Lakatos\nnever became a British citizen, but died a stateless person. Despite\nthe star-studded array of academic lords and knights who were willing\nto testify on his behalf, neither MI5 nor the Special Branch seem to\nhave trusted him, and no less a person than Roy Jenkins, the then Home\nSecretary, signed off on the refusal to naturalize him. (See Bandy\n2009: ch. 16, which includes the transcripts of successive\ninterrogations.)\n\nNonetheless, Lakatos\u2019s influence, particularly in the philosophy\nof science, has been immense. According to Google Scholar, by the\n25th of January 2015, that is, just twenty-five days into\nthe new year, thirty-three papers had been published citing\nLakatos in that year alone, a citation rate of over one paper\nper day. Introductory texts on the Philosophy of Science typically\ninclude substantial sections on Lakatos, some admiring, some critical,\nand many an admixture of the two (see for example Chalmers 2013 and\nGodfrey-Smith 2003). The premier prize for the best book in the\nPhilosophy of Science (funded by the foundation of a wealthy and\nacademically distinguished disciple, Spiro Latsis) is named in his\nhonour. Moreover, Lakatos is one of those philosophers whose influence\nextends well beyond the confines of academic philosophy. Of the\nthirty-three papers citing Lakatos published in the first twenty-five\ndays of 2015, at most ten qualify as straight philosophy. The\nrest are devoted to such topics as educational theory, international\nrelations, public policy research (with special reference to the\ndevelopment of technology), informatics, design science, religious\nstudies, clinical psychology, social economics, political economy,\nmathematics, the history of physics and the sociology of the family.\nThus Imre Lakatos was very much more than a philosophers\u2019\nphilosopher.\n\nFirst, we discuss Lakatos\u2019s life in relation to his works.\nLakatos\u2019s Hungarian career has now become a big issue in the\ncritical literature. This is partly because of disturbing facts about\nLakatos\u2019s early life that have only come to light in the West\nsince his death, and partly because of a dispute between the\n\u201cHungarian\u201d and the \u201cEnglish\u201d interpreters of\nLakatos\u2019s thought, between those writers (not all of them\nMagyars) who take the later Lakatos to be much more of a Hegelian (and\nperhaps much more of a disciple of Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs) than he\nliked to let on, and those who take his Hegelianism to be an\nincreasingly residual affair, not much more, in the end, than a habit\nof \u201ccoquetting\u201d with Hegelian expressions (Marx,\nCapital: 103). Just as there are analytic Marxists who think\nthat Marx\u2019s thought can be rationally reconstructed without the\nHegelian coquetry and dialectical Marxists who think that it cannot,\nso also there are analytic Lakatosians who think that Lakatos\u2019s\nthought can be largely reconstructed without the Hegelian coquetry and\ndialectical Lakatosians who think that it cannot (see for instance\nKadvany 2001 and Larvor 1998). Obviously, we cannot settle the matter\nin an Encyclopedia entry but we hope to say enough to illuminate the\nissue. (Spoiler alert: so far as the Philosophy of Science is\nconcerned, we tend to favor the English interpretation. We are more\nambivalent with respect to the Philosophy of Mathematics.)\n\nSecondly we discuss Lakatos\u2019s big ideas, the two contributions\nthat constitute his chief claims to fame as a philosopher, before\nmoving on (thirdly) to a more detailed discussion of some of his\nprincipal papers. We conclude with a section on the Feyerabend/Lakatos\nDebate. Lakatos was a provocative and combative thinker, and it\nfalsifies his thought to present it as less controversial (and perhaps\nless outrageous) than it actually was.\n\nNote: In referring to Lakatos\u2019s chief works (and to a couple of\nPopper\u2019s) we have employed a set of acronyms rather than the\nname/date system, hoping that this will be more perspicuous to\nreaders.

Life\n1.1 A Tale of Two Lakatoses\n\nImre Lakatos was a warm and witty friend and a charismatic and\ninspiring teacher ( Feyerabend 1975a). He was also a fallibilist, and\na professed foe of elitism and authoritarianism, taking a dim view of\nwhat he described as the Wittgensteinian \u201cthought police\u201d\n(owing to the Orwellian tendency on the part of some Wittgensteinians\nto suppress dissent by constricting the language, dismissing the stuff\nthat they did not like as inherently meaningless) (UT: 225 and\n228\u201336). In the later (and British) phase of his career he was a\ndedicated opponent of Marxism who played a prominent part in opposing\nthe socialist student radicals at the LSE in 1968, arguing\npassionately against the politicization of scholarship (LTD; Congden\n2002).\n\nBut in the earlier and Hungarian phase of his life, Lakatos was a\nStalinist revolutionary, the leader of a communist cell who persuaded\na young comrade that it was her duty to the revolution to commit\nsuicide, since otherwise she was likely to be arrested by the Nazis\nand coerced into betraying the valuable young cadres who constituted\nthe group (Bandy 2009: ch. 5; Long 1998 and 2002; Congden 1997). So\nfar from being a fallibilist, the young Lakatos displayed a cocksure\nself-confidence in his grasp of the historical situation, enough to\nexclude any alternative solution to the admittedly appalling problems\nthat this group of young and mostly Jewish communists were facing in\nNazi-occupied Hungary. (\u201cIs there no other way?\u201d the young\ncomrade asked. The answer, apparently, was \u201cNo\u201d: Long\n2002: 267.) After the Soviet victory, during the late 1940s, he was an\neager co-conspirator in the creation of a Stalinist state, in which\nthe denunciation of deviationists was the order of the day (Bandy\n2009: ch. 9). Lakatos was something close to a thought policeman\nhimself, with a powerful job in the Ministry of Education, vetting\nuniversity teachers for their political reliability (Bandy 2009: ch.\n8; Long 2002: 272\u20133; Congden 1997). Later on, after falling\nafoul of the regime that he had helped to establish and doing time in\na gulag at Recsk, he served the \u00c1VH, the Hungarian secret\npolice, as an informant by keeping tabs on his friends and comrades\n(Bandy 2009: ch. 14; Long 2002). And he took a prominent part, as a\nStalinist student radical, in trying to purge the University of\nDebrecen of \u201creactionary\u201d professors and students and in\nundermining the prestigious but unduly independent E\u00f6tv\u00f6s\nCollege, arguing passionately against the depoliticized (but covertly\nbourgeois) scholarship that E\u00f6tv\u00f6s allegedly stood for\n(Bandy 2009: chs. 4 and 9; Long 1998 and 2002).\n1.2 Life and Works: The Second World and the Third\n\nTo the many that knew and loved the later Lakatos, some of these facts\nare difficult to digest. But how relevant are they to assessing his\nphilosophy, which was largely the product of his British years? This\nis an important question as Lakatos was wont to draw a Popperian\ndistinction between World 3\u2014the world of theories, propositions\nand arguments\u2014and World 2\u2014the psychological world of\nbeliefs, decisions and desires. And he was sometimes inclined to\nsuggest that in assessing a philosopher\u2019s work we should confine\nourselves to World 3 considerations, leaving the subjectivities of\nWorld 2 to one side (F&AM: 140).\n\nSo does a philosopher\u2019s life have any bearing on his works? We\ntake our cue from the writings of Lakatos himself. Of course, there\nwere facts about his early career that Lakatos would not have wanted\nto be widely known, and which he managed to keep concealed from his\nWestern friends and colleagues during his lifetime. But what does his\nofficial philosophy have to say about the relevance of biographical\ndata to intellectual history?\n\nIn \u201cThe History of Science and its Rational\nReconstructions\u201d (HS&IRR) Lakatos develops a theory of how\nto do the history of science, which, with some adjustments, can be\nblown up into an account of how to do intellectual history in general.\nFor Lakatos, the default assumption in the history of science is that\nthe scientists in question are engaged in a more-or-less rational\neffort to solve a set of (relatively) \u201cpure\u201d problems\n(such as \u201cHow to explain the apparent motions of the heavenly\nbodies consistently with a plausible mechanics?\u201d). A\n\u201crational reconstruction\u201d in the history of science,\nemploys a theory of (scientific) rationality in conjunction with an\naccount of the problems as they appeared to the scientists in question\nto display some intellectual episode as a series of rational responses\nto the problem-situation. On the whole, it is a plus for a theory of\n[scientific] rationality if it can display the history of science as a\nrelatively rational affair and a strike against it if it cannot. Thus\nin Lakatos\u2019s opinion, na\u00efve versions of Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism are in a sense falsified by the history of science,\nsince they represent too much of it as an irrational affair with too\nmany scientists hanging on to hypotheses that they ought to have\nrecognized as refuted. If the rational reconstruction\nsucceeds\u2014that is if we can display some intellectual development\nas a rational response to the problem situation\u2014then we have an\n\u201cinternal\u201d history of the developments in question. If\nnot, then the \u201crational reconstruction of history needs to be\nsupplemented by an empirical (socio-psychological) \u2018external\nhistory\u2019\u201d (HS&IRR: 102). Non-rational or\n\u201cexternal\u201d factors sometimes interfere with the rational\ndevelopment of science. \u201cNo rationality theory will ever solve\nproblems like why Mendelian genetics disappeared in Soviet Russia in\nthe 1950s\u201d [the reason being that Lysenko, a Stalin favourite,\nacquired hegemonic status within the world of Soviet biology and\npersecuted the Mendelians] (HS&IRR: 114).\n\n(Perhaps this marks an important departure from Hegel. For a true\nHegelian, everything can, in the last analysis, be seen as\nrationally required for the self-realization of the Absolute. Hence\nall history is \u201cinternal\u201d in something like\nLakatos\u2019s sense, since the \u201ccunning of reason\u201d\nensures that apparently irrational impulses are subordinated to the\nultimate goal of history.)\n\nIs there, so to speak, an \u201cinternal\u201d history of\nLakatos\u2019s intellectual development that can be displayed as\nrational? Or must it be partly explained in terms of\n\u201cexternal\u201d influences? The answer depends on the account\nof rationality that we adopt and the problem situation that we take\nhim to have been addressing.\n\nWhether or not a particular theoretical (or practical) choice is\nsusceptible to an internal explanation depends, in part, on the\nactor\u2019s problem. Consider, for example, Descartes\u2019 theory\nof the vortices, namely that the planets are whirled round the sun by\na fluid medium which itself contains little whirlpools in which the\nindividual planets are swimming. Descartes\u2019 theory of the\nvortices, is fairly rational if we take it as an attempt (in\nthe light of what was then known) to explain the motion of the\nheavenly bodies in a way that is consistent with Copernican astronomy.\nBut it is a lot more rational if we take to be an attempt to\nexplain the motion of the heavenly bodies in a way that is consistent\nwith Copernican astronomy without formally contradicting the\nChurch\u2019s teaching that the earth does not move. (The\nearth goes round the sun but it does not move with respect to the\nfluid medium that whirls it round the sun, and, for Descartes, motion\nis defined as motion with respect to the contiguous matter.) So do we\nread Descartes\u2019 theory as a fairly rational attempt to\nsolve one problem which is distorted by an external factor or\nas a very rational attempt solve a related but more complex\nproblem? Well the answer may not be clear, but if we want to\nunderstand Descartes intellectual development we need to know that it\nwas an important constraint on his theorizing that his views should be\nformally consistent with the doctrines of the Church.\n\nSimilarly, it is important in understanding Lakatos\u2019s theorizing\nto realize (for example) that in later life he wanted to develop a\ndemarcation criterion between science and non-science that left Soviet\nMarxism (though not perhaps all forms of Marxism) on the\nnon-scientific side of the divide. And this holds whether we regard\nthis constraint as a non-rational external factor or as a\nconstituent of his problem situation and hence internal to a rational\nreconstruction of his intellectual development. Biographical facts can\nbe relevant to understanding a thinker\u2019s ideas since they can\nhelp to illuminate the problem situation to which they were\naddressed.\n\nFurthermore, the big issue with respect to Lakatos\u2019s development\nis how much of the old Hegelian-Marxist remained in the later\npost-Popperian philosopher, and how much of his philosophy was a\nreaction against his earlier self. To answer this question we need to\nknow something about that earlier self\u2014either the self that\nsecretly persisted or the self that the later Lakatos was reacting\nagainst.\n1.3 From Stalinist Revolutionary to Methodologist of Science\n\nImre Lakatos was born Imre Lipsitz in Debrecen, eastern Hungary, on\nNovember 9, 1922, the only child of Jewish parents, Jacob Marton\nLipsitz and Margit Herczfeld. Lakatos\u2019s parents parted when he\nwas very young and he was largely brought up by his grandmother and\nhis mother who worked as a beautician. The Hungary into which Lakatos\nwas born was a kingdom without a king ruled by an admiral without a\nnavy, the \u201cRegent\u201d Admiral Horthy, who had gained his\nnaval rank in the service of the then-defunct Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nThe regime was authoritarian, a sort of fascism-lite. After a\nbrilliant school career, during which he won mathematics competitions\nand a multitude of prizes, Lakatos entered Debrecen University in\n1940. Lakatos graduated in Physics, Mathematics, and Philosophy in\n1944. During his time at Debrecen he became a committed communist,\nattending illegal underground communist meetings and, in 1943,\nstarting his own illegal study group.\n\n\nNo-one who attended Imre\u2019s groups has forgotten the intensity\nand brilliance of the atmosphere. \u201cHe opened the world to\nme!\u201d a participant said. Even those who were later disillusioned\nwith communism or ashamed of acts they committed, remember the sense\nof inspiration, clear thinking and hope for a new society they felt in\nImre\u2019s secret seminars. (Long 2002: 265)\n\n\nHowever, in Lakatos\u2019s group the emphasis was on preparing the\nyoung cadres for the coming communist revolution, rather than engaging\nin public propaganda or antifascist resistance activities (Bandy 2009:\nch. 3).\n\nIn March 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary to forestall its attempts to\nnegotiate a separate peace. (The Hungarian government had allied with\nthe Axis powers, in the hopes of recovering some of the territories\nlost at the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. By 1944 they had begun to\nrealize that this was a mistake.) Admiral Horthy, whose anti-Semitism\nwas a more gentlemanly affair than that of the Nazis (he was fine with\nsystematic discrimination but apparently drew the line at\nmass-murder), was forced to accept a collaborationist government led\nby D\u00f6me Szt\u00f3jay as prime minister. The new regime had none\nof Horthy\u2019s humanitarian scruples and began a policy of\nenthusiastic and systematic cooperation with the Nazi genocide\nprogram. In May, Lakatos\u2019s mother, grandmother and other\nrelatives were forced into the Debrecen ghetto, thence to die in\nAuschwitz\u2014the fate of about 600,000 Hungarian Jews.\nLakatos\u2019s father, a wine merchant, managed to get away and\nsurvived the war, eventually ending up in Australia. A little earlier,\nin March, Lakatos himself had managed to escape from Debrecen to\nNagyv\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania) with false papers under the\nname of Moln\u00e1r. Later, a Hungarian friend, Vilma Bal\u00e1zs,\nrecalled that\n\n\nImre [had been] very close to his mother and they were quite poor. He\noften blamed himself for her death and wondered if he could have saved\nher (Bandy 2009: 32).\n\n\nIn Nagyv\u00e1rad Lakatos restarted his Marxist group. The co-leader\nwas his then-girlfriend and subsequent wife, \u00c9va\nR\u00e9v\u00e9sz. In May, the group was joined by \u00c9va\nIzs\u00e1k, a 19-year-old Jewish antifascist activist who needed\nlodgings with a non-Jewish family. Lakatos decided that there was a\nrisk that she would be captured and forced to betray them, hence her\nduty, both to the group and to the cause, was to commit suicide. A\nmember of the group took her across country to Debrecen and gave her\ncyanide (Congden 1997, Long 2002, Bandy 2009, ch. 5). To lovers of\nRussian literature, the episode recalls Dostoevsky\u2019s The\nPossessed/Demons (based in part on the real-life Nechaev affair).\nIn Dostoevsky\u2019s novel the anti-Tsarist revolutionary, Pyotr\nVerkhovensky, posing as the representative of a large revolutionary\norganization, tries to solidify the provincial cell of which he is the\nchief by getting the rest of group to share in the murder of a\ndissident member who supposedly poses a threat to the group. (It does\nnot work for the fictional Pytor Verkhovensky and it did work for the\nreal-life Sergei Nechaev.) Hence the title of Congden\u2019s 1997\nexpos\u00e9: \u201cPossessed: Imre Lakatos\u2019s Road to\n1956\u201d. But to communists or former communists of Lakatos\u2019s\ngeneration, it recalled a different book: Chocolate, by the\nBolshevik writer Aleksandr Tarasov-Rodianov. This is a stirring tale\nof revolutionary self-sacrifice in which the hero is the chief of the\nlocal Cheka (the forerunner of the KGB). Popular in Hungary, it\nencouraged a romantic cult of revolutionary ruthlessness and sacrifice\nin its (mostly) youthful readers. As one of Lakatos\u2019s\ncontemporaries, Gy\u00f6rgy Magosh put it,\n\n\nHow that book inspired us. How we longed to be professional\nrevolutionaries who could be hanged several times a day in the\ninterest of the working class and of the great Soviet Union (Bandy\n2009: 31).\n\n\nIt was in that spirit, that the ardent young Marxist, \u00c9va\nIzs\u00e1k, could be persuaded that it was her duty to kill herself\nfor the sake of the cause. As for Lakatos himself, a chance remark in\nhis most famous paper suggests something about his attitude.\n\n\nOne has to appreciate the dare-devil attitude of our methodological\nfalsificationist [or perhaps as he would have said in an earlier phase\nof his career, the conscientious Leninist]. He feels himself to be a\nhero who, faced with two catastrophic alternatives, dares to reflect\ncoolly on their relative merits and [to] choose the lesser evil.\n(FMSRP: 28)\n\n\nIf you admire the hero who has the courage to make the tough choice\nbetween two catastrophic alternatives, isn\u2019t there a temptation\nto manufacture catastrophic alternatives so that you can heroically\nchoose between them?\n\nLate in 1944, following a Soviet victory, Lakatos returned to\nDebrecen, and changed his name from the Germanic Jewish\nLipsitz to the Hungarian proletarian Lakatos\n(meaning \u201clocksmith\u201d). He became active in the now legal\nCommunist Party and in two leftist youth and student organizations,\nthe Hungarian Democratic Youth Federation (MADISZ) and the Debrecen\nUniversity Circle (DEK). As one of the leaders of the DEK, Lakatos\nagitated for the dismissal of reactionary professors from Debrecen and\nthe exclusion of reactionary students.\n\n\nWe are aware that this move on our part is incompatible with the\ntraditional and often voiced \u201cautonomy\u201d of the university\n[Lakatos stated], but respect for autonomy, in our view, cannot mean\nthat we have to tolerate the strengthening of fascism and reaction\n(Bandy 2009: 59 and 61).\n\n\nLakatos moved to Budapest in 1946. He became a graduate student at\nBudapest University, but spent much of his time working towards the\ncommunist takeover of Hungary. This was a slow-motion affair,\ncharacterized by the infamous \u201csalami tactics\u201d of the\nCommunist leader M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi. Lakatos worked\nchiefly in the Ministry of Education, evaluating the credentials of\nuniversity teachers and making lists of those who should be dismissed\nas untrustworthy once the communists had taken over (Bandy 2009: ch.\n8). He was also a student at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s College, but attacked it\npublicly as an elitist and bourgeois institution. The College, and\nothers like it, was closed in 1950 after the communist takeover. In\n1947 Lakatos gained his doctorate from Debrecen University for a\nthesis entitled \u201cOn the Sociology of Concept Formation in the\nNatural Sciences\u201d. In 1948, after the communist takeover was\nsubstantially complete, he gained a scholarship to undertake further\nstudy in Moscow.\n\nLakatos flew to Moscow in January 1949, only to be recalled for\n\u201cun-Party-like\u201d behaviour in July. What these\n\u201cun-party-like\u201d activities were is something of a mystery\nbut even more of a mystery is why, having returned from Moscow under a\ncloud, he seemed so cool, calm and collected. Lakatos\u2019s\nbiographers, Long and Bandy, speculate that he was being held in\nreserve to prepare a case against the communist education chief,\nJ\u00f3zsef R\u00e9vai, who was scheduled to appear in a new show\ntrial. But when R\u00e1kosi decided not to prosecute R\u00e9vai\nafter all, Lakatos was thrown to the wolves (Bandy 2009: ch. 12; Long\n2002). He was arrested in April 1950 on charges of revisionism and,\nafter a period in the cellars of the secret police (including, of\ncourse, torture), he was condemned to the prison camp at Recsk.\n\nHowever Lakatos was probably doomed anyway. In later life Lakatos was\nbig admirer of Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four. Perhaps\nhe recognized himself in Orwell\u2019s description of the Party\nintellectual (and expert on Newspeak) Syme:\n\n\nUnquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought again. He\nthought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that\nSyme\u2026was fully capable of denouncing him as a thought-criminal\nif he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong\nwith Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness,\na sort of saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox.\nHe believed in the principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he\nrejoiced over victories, he hated heretics\u2026. Yet a faint air of\ndisreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have\nbeen better unsaid, he had read too many books\u2026. (Orwell 2008\n[1949]: 58)\n\n\nAn instance of Lakatos\u2019s Syme-like behaviour is his 1947\ndenunciation of the literary critic and philosopher Gy\u00f6rgy\nLuk\u00e1cs, one of the intellectual luminaries of the communist\nmovement. Luk\u00e1cs represented the academically respectable face\nof communism, and favoured a gradual and democratic transition to the\ndictatorship of the proletariat. Lakatos organized an\n\u201canti-Luk\u00e1cs meeting\u2026held under the aegis of the\nVal\u00f3s\u00e1g Circle\u201d to critique Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s\nfoot-dragging and \u201cWeimarism\u201d (Bandy 2009: 110). Once the\nregime was firmly in control, Luk\u00e1cs was indeed censured for\nhis undue concessions to bourgeois democracy, and he spent the early\nfifties under a cloud. But in 1947, Lakatos\u2019s criticisms were\ndeemed premature and he got into trouble because of his un-Party-like\nactivities. (Luk\u00e1cs himself referred to the episode as a\n\u201ccliquish kaffe klatsch\u201d.) In Communist Hungary\nit was important not to be \u201cone pamphlet behind\u201d the Party\nline (Bandy 2009: 92). Lakatos was the sort of over-zealous communist\nwho was sometimes a couple of pamphlets ahead.\n\nAfter his release from Recsk in September 1953 (minus several teeth),\nLakatos remained for a while, a loyal Stalinist. He eked out a living\nin the Mathematics Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Science,\nreading, researching and translating (including a translation into\nHungarian of George P\u00f3lya\u2019s How to Solve It).\nDuring this time he was informing on friends and colleagues to the\n\u00c1VH, the Hungarian secret police, though he subsequently\nclaimed that he did not pass on anything incriminating (Long, 2002:\n290 ). It was whilst working at the Mathematics Institute that he\nfirst gained access to the works of Popper. Gradually he turned\nagainst the Stalinist Marxism that had been his creed. He married (as\nhis second wife) \u00c9va Pap and lived at her parents\u2019 house\n(his father-in-law being the distinguished agronomist, Endre Pap). In\n1956 he joined the revisionist Pet\u0151fi Circle and delivered a\nstirring speech on \u201cOn Rearing Scholars\u201d which at least\nburnt his bridges with Stalinism:\n\n\nThe very foundation of scholarly education is to foster in students\nand postgrads a respect for facts, for the necessity of thinking\nprecisely, and to demand proof. Stalinism, however, branded this as\nbourgeois objectivism. Under the banner of partinost\n[Party-like] science and scholarship, we saw a vast experiment to\ncreate a science without facts, without proofs.\n\n\u2026 a basic aspect of the rearing of scholars must be an\nendeavour to promote independent thought, individual judgment, and to\ndevelop conscience and a sense of justice. Recent years have seen an\nentire ideological campaign against independent thinking and against\nbelieving one\u2019s own senses. This was the struggle against\nempiricism [Laughter and applause] (Bandy 2009: 221. Bandy quotes the\ntranscripts which seem to differ slightly from the prepared text in\nthe Lakatos archives, reprinted in F&AM)\n\n\nBut Lakatos was not just explicitly repudiating Stalinism. He was also\nimplicitly criticizing another prominent member of the Pet\u0151fi\nCircle who had been a big influence on his first PhD, namely\nGy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs. (See Ropolyi 2002 for the early influence.)\nFor Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s work is pervaded by just the kind of\nhostility towards empiricism and disdain for facts that Lakatos is\ndenouncing in his speech, as well as an arts-sider\u2019s contempt\nfor the natural sciences, all of which would have been anathema to the\nlater Lakatos. Indeed Luk\u00e1cs was notorious for the view that\nthat\n\n\neven if the development of science had proved all Marx\u2019s\nassertions to be false\u2026we could accept this scientific\ncriticism without demur and still remain Marxists\u2014as long as we\nadhered to the Marxist method\n\n\nand that\n\n\nthe orthodox Marxist who realizes that\u2026the time has come for\nthe expropriation of the exploiters, will respond to the\nvulgar-Marxist litany of \u201cfacts\u201d which contradict this\nprocess with the words of Fichte, one of the greatest of classical\nGerman philosophers: \u201cSo much the worse for the facts\u201d.\n(Luk\u00e1cs 2014 [1919]: ch. 3.)\n\n\nThus the Stalinist Lakatos of 1947 had explicitly denounced\nLuk\u00e1cs for not being Stalinist enough, but the revisionist\nLakatos of 1956 was implicitly denouncing Luk\u00e1cs for being\nmethodologically too much of a Stalinist. For the later Lakatos, what\nwas wrong with \u201corthodox Marxism\u201d was chiefly that its\nnovel factual predictions had been systematically falsified (see\n \u00a73.2\n below). But that was pretty much the complaint of early revisionists\nsuch as Bernstein (see Kolakowski 1978: ch. 4) and it was against that\nkind of revisionism that Luk\u00e1cs\u2019s Bolshevik writings were\na protest. (See Luk\u00e1cs 1971 [1923] and 2014 [1919].) Though\nfactual \u201crefutations\u201d of a research programme are not\nalways decisive, a Luk\u00e1cs-like indifference to the facts is,\nfor Lakatos, the mark of a fundamentally unscientific attitude. In our\nopinion, this puts paid to Ropolyi\u2019s claim that Luk\u00e1cs\ncontinued to be a major influence on the later Lakatos.\n\nLakatos left Hungary in November 1956 after the Soviet Union crushed\nthe short-lived Hungarian revolution. He walked across the border into\nAustria with his wife and her parents. Within two months he was at\nKing\u2019s College Cambridge, with a Rockefeller Fellowship to write\na PhD under the supervision of R.B. Braithwaite, which he completed in\n1959 under the title \u201cEssays in the Logic of Mathematical\nDiscovery\u201d. If we set aside his romantic adventures, the story\nof Lakatos\u2019s life thereafter is largely the story of his work,\nthough we should not forget his activities as an academic politician.\nEven his friendship with Feyerabend and his friendship and subsequent\nbust-up with Popper were very much work-related. In Britain his\nacademic career was meteoric. In 1960 he was appointed Assistant\nLecturer in Karl Popper\u2019s department at the London School of\nEconomics. By 1969 he was Professor of Logic, with a worldwide\nreputation as a philosopher of science. During the student revolts of\nthe 1960s, which in Britain were centred on the LSE, Lakatos became an\nestablishment figure. He wrote a \u201cLetter to the Director of the\nLondon School of Economics\u201d defending academic freedom and\nacademic autonomy, which was widely circulated. It denounces the\nstudent radicals for allegedly trying to do what he himself had done\nat Debrecen and E\u00f6tv\u00f6s (though he was careful to conceal the\nparallel, citing Nazi and Muscovite precedents instead) (LTD:\n247).\n\nLakatos died suddenly in 1974 of a heart attack at the height of his\npowers. He was 51. \n2. Lakatos\u2019s Big Ideas\n\nImre Lakatos has two chief claims to fame.\n2.1 Against Formalism in Mathematics\n\nThe first is his Philosophy of Mathematics, especially as set forth in\n\u201cProofs and Refutations\u201d (1963\u201364) a series of four\narticles, based on his PhD thesis, and written in the form of a\nmany-sided dialogue. These were subsequently combined in a posthumous\nbook and published, with additions, in 1976. The title is an allusion\nto a famous paper of Popper\u2019s, \u201cConjectures and\nRefutations\u201d (the signature essay of his best-known collection),\nin which Popper outlines his philosophy of science. Lakatos\u2019s\npoint is that the development of mathematics is much more like the\ndevelopment of science as portrayed by Popper than is commonly\nsupposed, and indeed much more like the development of science as\nportrayed by Popper than Popper himself supposed.\n\nWhat Lakatos does not make so much of (though he does not conceal it\neither) is that in his view the development of mathematics is also\nmuch more like the development of thought in general as\nanalysed by Hegel than Hegel himself supposed. There is\nthesis, antithesis and synthesis, \u201cHegelian language, which\n[Lakatos thinks would] generally be capable of describing the various\ndevelopments in mathematics\u201d (P&R: 146). Thus there is a\ncertain sense in which Lakatos out-Hegels Hegel, giving a dialectical\nanalysis of a discipline (mathematics) that Hegel himself despised as\ninsufficiently dialectical (see Larvor 1998, 1999, 2001). Hence\nFeyerabend\u2019s gibe (which Lakatos took in good part) that Lakatos\nwas a Pop-Hegelian, the bastard child of Popperian father and a\nHegelian mother (F&AM: 184\u2013185).\n\nProofs and Refutations is a critique of\n\u201cformalist\u201d philosophies of mathematics (including\nformalism proper, logicism and intuitionism), which, in\nLakatos\u2019s view, radically misrepresent the nature of mathematics\nas an intellectual enterprise. For Lakatos, the development of\nmathematics should not be construed as series of Euclidean deductions\nwhere the contents of the relevant concepts has been carefully\nspecified in advance so as to preclude equivocation. Rather, these\nwater-tight deductions from well-defined premises are the (perhaps\ntemporary) end-points of an evolutionary, and indeed a\ndialectical, process in which the constituent concepts are\ninitially ill-defined, open-ended or ambiguous but become sharper and\nmore precise in the context of a protracted debate. The proofs are\nrefined in conjunction with the concepts (hence \u201cproof-generated\nconcepts\u201d) whilst \u201crefutations\u201d in the form of\ncounterexamples play a prominent part in the process. [One might\nalmost say, paraphrasing Hegel, that in Lakatos\u2019s view\n\u201cwhen Euclidean demonstrations paint their grey in grey, then\nhas a shape of mathematical life grown old\u2026The owl of the\nformalist Minerva begins its flight only with the falling of\ndusk\u201d (Hegel 2008 [1820/21]: 16).]\n\nLakatos is also keen to display the development of mathematics as a\nrational affair even though the proofs (to begin with) are\noften lacking in logical rigour and the key concepts are often\nopen-ended and unclear\n\n\nThe idea\u2014expressed so clearly by Seidel [and clearly endorsed by\nLakatos himself]\u2014that a proof can be respectable without being\nflawless, was a revolutionary one in 1847, and, unfortunately, still\nsounds revolutionary today. (P&R: 139)\n\n\nA corollary of this is that in mathematics many of the\n\u201cproofs\u201d are not really proofs in the full sense of the\nword (that is, demonstrations that proceed deductively from apodictic\npremises via unquestionable rules of inference to certain conclusions)\nand that many of the \u201crefutations\u201d are not really\nrefutations either, since something rather like the\n\u201crefuted\u201d thesis often survives the refutation and arises\nrefreshed and invigorated from the dialectical process.\n\nThis becomes apparent early on in the dialogue, when the Popperian\nGamma protests at the Teacher\u2019s insouciance with respect to\nrefutation, a counterexample to Euler\u2019s thesis (and therefore to\nCauchy\u2019s proof) that, for all regular polyhedra, the number of\nvertices, minus the number of edges, plus the number of faces equals\ntwo. The counterexample is a solid bounded by a pair of nested cubes,\none of which is inside, but does not touch the other:\n\n\n\n\nFor this hollow cube, \\(V - E + F\\) (including both the inner and the\nouter ones) \\(= 4\\). According to Gamma, this simply refutes\nEuler\u2019s conjecture and disproves Cauchy\u2019s proof:\n\n\nGAMMA: Sir, your composure baffles me. A single counterexample refutes\na conjecture as effectively as ten. The conjecture and its proof have\ncompletely misfired. Hands up! You have to surrender. Scrap the false\nconjecture, forget about it and try a radically new approach.\n\nTEACHER: I agree with you that the conjecture has received a\nsevere criticism by Alpha\u2019s counterexample. But it is untrue\nthat the proof has \u201ccompletely misfired\u201d. If, for the time\nbeing, you agree to my earlier proposal to use the word\n\u201cproof\u201d for a \u201cthought-experiment which leads to\ndecomposition of the original conjecture into subconjectures\u201d,\ninstead of using it in the sense of a \u201c guarantee of certain\ntruth\u201d, you need not draw this conclusion. My proof certainly\nproved Euler\u2019s conjecture in the first sense, but not\nnecessarily in the second. You are interested only in proofs which\n\u201cprove\u201d what they have set out to prove. I am interested\nin proofs even if they do not accomplish their intended task. Columbus\ndid not reach India but he discovered something quite interesting.\n\n\nThus even in his earlier work, when he is still a professed disciple\nof Popper, Lakatos is already a rather dissident Popperian. Firstly,\nthere are the hat-tips to Hegel as well as to Popper that\ncrop up from time to time in Proofs and Refutations including\nthe passage where he praises (and condemns) them both in the same\nbreath. (\u201cHegel and Popper represent the only fallibilist\ntraditions in modem philosophy, but even they both made the mistake of\nreserving a privileged infallible status for mathematics\u201d.\nP&R: 139n.1.) Given that Hegel was anathema to Popper (witness his\nfamous or notorious anti-Hegel \u201cscherzo\u201d in The Open\nSociety and Its Enemies, (1945 [1966])) this strongly suggests\nthat Lakatos took his Popper with a large pinch of salt. Secondly, for\nPopper himself a proof is a proof and a refutation is supposed to kill\na scientific conjecture stone-dead. Thus non-demonstrative proofs and\nnon-refuting refutations mark a major departure from Popperian\northodoxy.\n2.2 Improving on Popper in the Philosophy of Science\n\nThe dissidence continues with Lakatos\u2019s second major\ncontribution to philosophy, his \u201cMethodology of Scientific\nResearch Programmes\u201d or MSRP (developed in detail in in his\nFMSRP), a radical revision of Popper\u2019s Demarcation Criterion\nbetween science and non-science, leading to a novel theory of\nscientific rationality. This is arguably a lot more realistic than the\nPopperian theory it was designed to supplant (or, in earlier\nformulations, the Popperian theory that it was designed to amend). For\nPopper, a theory is only scientific if is empirically\nfalsifiable, that is if it is possible to specify observation\nstatements which would prove it wrong. A theory is good\nscience, the sort of theory you should stick with (though not the sort\nof thing you should believe since Popper did not believe in belief),\nif it is refutable, risky, and problem-solving and has stood up to\nsuccessive attempts at refutation. It must be highly falsifiable,\nwell-tested but (thus far) unfalsified.\n\nLakatos objects that although there is something to be said for\nPopper\u2019s criterion, it is far too restrictive, since it would\nrule out too much of everyday scientific practice (not to mention the\nvalue-judgments of the scientific elite) as unscientific and\nirrational. For scientists often persist\u2014and, it seems,\nrationally persist\u2014with theories, such as Newtonian\ncelestial mechanics that by Popper\u2019s standards they ought to\nhave rejected as \u201crefuted\u201d, that is theories that (in\nconjunction with other assumptions) have led to falsified predictions.\nA key example for Lakatos is the \u201cPrecession of Mercury\u201d\nthat is, the anomalous behaviour of the perihelion of Mercury, which\nshifts around the Sun in a way that it ought not to do if\nNewton\u2019s mechanics were correct and there were no other sizable\nbody influencing its orbit. The problem is that there seems to be no\nsuch body. The difficulty was well known for decades but it did not\ncause astronomers to collectively give up on Newton until\nEinstein\u2019s theory came along. Lakatos thought that the\nastronomers were right not to abandon Newton even though Newton\neventually turned out to be wrong and Einstein turned out to be\nright.\n\nAgain, Copernican heliocentric astronomy was born\n\u201crefuted\u201d because of the apparent non-existence of stellar\nparallax. If the earth goes round the sun then the apparent position\nof at least some of the fixed stars (namely the closest ones)\nought to vary with respect to the more distant ones as the earth is\nmoving with respect to them. Some parts of the night sky should look a\nlittle different at perihelion (when the earth is furthest from the\nsun) from the way that they look at aphelion (when the earth is at its\nnearest to the sun, and hence at the other end of its orbit). But for\nnearly three centuries after the publication of Copernicus\u2019\nDe Revolutionibus 1543, no such differences were observed. In\nfact, there is a very slight difference in the apparent positions of\nthe nearest stars depending on the earth\u2019s position in its\norbit, but the difference is so very slight as to be almost\nundetectable. Indeed it was completely undetectable until\n1838 when sufficiently powerful telescopes and measuring techniques\nwere able to detect it, by which time the heliocentric view had long\nbeen regarded as an established fact. Thus astronomers had not given\nup on either Copernicus or his successors despite this apparent\nfalsification.\n\nBut if scientists often persist with \u201crefuted\u201d theories,\neither the scientists are being unscientific or Popper is wrong about\nwhat constitutes good science, and hence about what scientists ought\nto do. Lakatos\u2019s idea is to construct a methodology of science,\nand with it a demarcation criterion, whose precepts are more in\naccordance with scientific practice.\n\nHow does it work? Well, falsifiability continues to play a part in\nLakatos\u2019s conception of science but its importance is somewhat\ndiminished. Instead of an individual falsifiable theory which\nought to be rejected as soon as it is refuted, we have a\nsequence of falsifiable theories characterized by shared a\nhard core of central theses that are deemed\nirrefutable\u2014or, at least, refutation-resistant\u2014by\nmethodological fiat. This sequence of theories constitutes a\nresearch programme.\n\nThe shared hard core of this sequence of theories is often\nunfalsifiable in two senses of the term.\n\nFirstly scientists working within the programme are typically (and\nrightly) reluctant to give up on the claims that constitute the hard\ncore.\n\nSecondly the hard core theses by themselves are often devoid\nof empirical consequences. For example, Newtonian mechanics by\nitself\u2014the three laws of mechanics and the law of\ngravitation\u2014won\u2019t tell you what you will see in the night\nsky. To derive empirical predictions from Newtonian mechanics you need\na whole host of auxiliary hypotheses about the positions,\nmasses and relative velocities of the heavenly bodies, including the\nearth. (This is related to Duhem\u2019s thesis that, generally\nspeaking, theoretical propositions\u2014and indeed sets of\ntheoretical propositions\u2014cannot be conclusively falsified by\nexperimental observations, since they only entail\nobservation-statements in conjunction with auxiliary hypotheses. So\nwhen something goes wrong, and the observation statements that they\nentail turn out to be false, we have two intellectual\noptions: modify the theoretical propositions or modify the auxiliary\nhypotheses. See Ariew 2014.) For Lakatos an individual theory within a\nresearch programme typically consists of two components: the (more or\nless) irrefutable hard core plus a set of auxiliary hypotheses.\nTogether with the hard core these auxiliary hypotheses entail\nempirical predictions, thus making the theory as a whole\u2014hard\ncore plus auxiliary hypotheses\u2014a falsifiable affair.\n\nWhat happens when refutation strikes, that is when the hard core in\nconjunction with the auxiliary hypotheses entails empirical\npredictions which turn out to be false? What we have essentially is a\nmodus tollens argument in which science supplies one of the\npremises and nature (plus experiment and observation) supplies the\nother:\n\n\nIf <hard core plus auxiliary hypotheses>, then O\n(where O represents some observation statement);\nNot-O (Nature shouts \u201cno\u201d: the predictions\ndon\u2019t pan out);\n\n\nTherefore\n\nNot <hard core plus auxiliary hypotheses>.\n\n\n\nBut logic leaves us with a choice. The conjunction of the\nhard core plus the auxiliary hypotheses has to go, but we can retain\neither the hard core or the auxiliary hypotheses. What Lakatos calls\nthe negative heuristic of the research programme, bids us\nretain the hard core but modify the auxiliary hypotheses:\n\n\nThe negative heuristic of the programme forbids us to direct the\nmodus tollens at this \u201chard core\u201d. Instead, we\nmust use our ingenuity to articulate or even invent \u201cauxiliary\nhypotheses\u201d, which form a protective belt around this core, and\nwe must redirect the modus tollens to these. It is this\nprotective belt of auxiliary hypotheses which has to bear the\nbrunt of tests and gets adjusted and re-adjusted, or even completely\nreplaced, to defend the thus-hardened core. (FMSRP: 48)\n\n\nThus when refutation strikes, the scientist constructs a new\ntheory, the next in the sequence, with the same hard core but a\nmodified set of auxiliary hypotheses. How is she supposed to do this?\nWell, associated with the hard core, there is what Lakatos calls the\npositive heuristic of the programme.\n\n\nThe positive heuristic consists of a partially articulated set of\nsuggestions or hints on how to change, develop the \u201crefutable\nvariants\u201d of the research programme, how to modify,\nsophisticate, the \u201crefutable\u201d protective belt. (FMSRP:\n50)\n\n\nFor example, if a planet is not moving in quite the smooth ellipse\nthat it ought to follow a) if Newtonian mechanics were correct and b)\nif there were nothing but the sun and the planet itself to worry\nabout, then the positive heuristic of the Newtonian programme bids us\nlook for another heavenly body whose gravitational force\nmight be distorting the first planet\u2019s orbit. Alternatively, if\nstellar parallax is not observed, we can try to refute this apparent\nrefutation by refining our instruments and making more careful\nmeasurements and observations.\n\nLakatos evidently thinks that when one theory in the sequence has been\nrefuted, scientists can legitimately persist with the hard core\nwithout being in too much of a hurry to construct the next refutable\ntheory in the sequence. The fact that some planetary orbits are not\nquite what they ought to be should not lead us to abandon Newtonian\ncelestial mechanics, even if we don\u2019t yet have a testable theory\nabout what exactly is distorting them. It is worth remarking too that\nthe auxiliary hypotheses play a rather paradoxical part in\nLakatos\u2019s methodology. On the one hand, they connect\nthe central theses of the hard core with experience, allowing to them\nto figure in testable, and hence, refutable theories. On the other\nhand, they insulate the theses of the hard core from\nrefutation, since when the arrow of modus tollens strikes, we\ndirect it at the auxiliary hypotheses rather than the hard core.\n\nSo far we have had an account of what scientists typically do\ndo and what Lakatos thinks that they ought to do. But what\nabout the Demarcation Criterion between science and non-science or\nbetween good science and bad? Even if it is sometimes\nrational to persist with the hard core of a theory when the hard core\nplus some set of auxiliary hypotheses has been refuted, there must\nsurely be some circumstances in which is it rational to give\nit up! The Methodology of Scientific Research Programme has got to be\nsomething more than a defence of scientific pig-headedness! As Lakatos\nhimself puts the point:\n\n\nNow, Newton\u2019s theory of gravitation, Einstein\u2019s relativity\ntheory, quantum mechanics, Marxism, Freudianism [the last two stock\nexamples of bad science or pseudo-science for Popperians], are all\nresearch programmes, each with a characteristic hard core stubbornly\ndefended, each with its more flexible protective belt and each with\nits elaborate problem-solving machinery. Each of them, at any stage of\nits development, has unsolved problems and undigested anomalies. All\ntheories, in this sense, are born refuted and die refuted. But are\nthey [all] equally good? (S&P: 4\u20135.)\n\n\nLakatos, of course, thinks not. Some science is objectively better\nthan other science and some science is so unscientific as to hardly\nqualify as science at all. So how does he distinguish between \u201ca\nscientific or progressive programme\u201d and a\n\u201cpseudoscientific or degenerating one\u201d? (S&P:\n4\u20135.)\n\nTo begin with, the unit of scientific evaluation is no longer the\nindividual theory (as with Popper), but the sequence of\ntheories, the research programme. We don\u2019t ask\nourselves whether this or that theory is scientific or not, or whether\nit constitutes good or bad science. Rather we ask ourselves whether\nthe sequence of theories, the research programme, is\nscientific or non-scientific or constitutes good or bad science.\nLakatos\u2019s basic idea is that a research programme constitutes\ngood science\u2014the sort of science it is rational to\nstick with and rational to work on\u2014if it is\nprogressive, and bad science\u2014the kind of\nscience that is, at least, intellectually suspect\u2014if it\nis degenerating. What is it for a research programme to be\nprogressive? It must meet two conditions. Firstly it must be\ntheoretically progressive. That is, each new theory in the\nsequence must have excess empirical content over its predecessor; it\nmust predict novel and hitherto unexpected facts (FMSRP: 33). Secondly\nit must be empirically progressive. Some of that novel\ncontent has to be corroborated, that is, some of the new\n\u201cfacts\u201d that the theory predicts must turn out to be true.\nAs Lakatos himself put the point, a research programme \u201cis\nprogressive if it is both theoretically and empirically\nprogressive, and degenerating if it is not\u201d (FMSRP:\n34). Thus a research programme is degenerating if the successive\ntheories do not deliver novel predictions or if the novel predictions\nthat they deliver turn out to be false.\n\nNovelty is, in part, a comparative notion. The novelty of a research\nprogramme\u2019s predictions is defined with respect to its rivals. A\nprediction is novel if the theory not only predicts something\nnot predicted by the previous theories in the sequence, but\nif the predicted observation is predicted neither by any\nrival programme that might be in the offing nor by the\nconventional wisdom. A programme gets no brownie points by predicting\nwhat everyone knows to be the case but only by predicting observations\nwhich come as some sort of a surprise. (There is some ambiguity here\nand some softening later on\u2014see below\n \u00a73.6\u2014but\n to begin with, at least, this was Lakatos\u2019s dominant idea.)\n\nOne of Lakatos\u2019s key examples is the predicted return of\nHalley\u2019s comet which was derived by observing part of its\ntrajectory and using Newtonian mechanics to calculate the elongated\nellipse in which it was moving. The comet duly turned up seventy-two\nyears later, exactly where and when Halley had predicted, a novel fact\nthat could not have been arrived at without the aid of Newton\u2019s\ntheory (S&P: 5). Before Newton, astronomers might have noticed a\ncomet arriving every seventy-two years (though they would have been\nhard put to it to distinguish that particular comet from any others),\nbut they could not have been as exact about the time and place of its\nreappearance as Halley managed to be. Newton\u2019s theory delivered\nfar more precise predictions than the rival heliocentric theory\ndeveloped by Descartes, let alone the earth-centered Ptolemaic\ncosmology that had ruled the intellectual roost for centuries.\nThat\u2019s the kind of spectacular corroboration that propels a\nresearch programme into the lead. And it was a similarly novel\nprediction, spectacularly confirmed, that dethroned Newton\u2019s\nphysics in favour of Einstein\u2019s. Here\u2019s Lakatos again:\n\n\nThis programme made the stunning prediction that if one measures the\ndistance between two stars in the night and if one measures the\ndistance between them during the day (when they are visible during an\neclipse of the sun), the two measurements will be different. Nobody\nhad thought to make such an observation before Einstein\u2019s\nprogramme. Thus, in progressive research programme, theory leads to\nthe discovery of hitherto unknown novel facts. (S&P: 5.)\n\n\nA degenerating research programme, on the other hand (unlike the\ntheories of Newton and Einstein) either fails to predict novel facts\nat all, or makes novel predictions that are systematically falsified.\nMarxism, for example, started out as theoretically progressive but\nempirically degenerate (novel predictions systematically falsified)\nand ended up as theoretically degenerate as well (no more novel\npredictions but a desperate attempt to explain away unpredicted\n\u201cobservations\u201d after the event).\n\n\nHas\u2026Marxism ever predicted a stunning novel fact successfully?\nNever! It has some famous unsuccessful predictions. It predicted the\nabsolute impoverishment of the working class. It predicted that the\nfirst socialist revolution would take place in the industrially most\ndeveloped society. It predicted that socialist societies would be free\nof revolutions. It predicted that there will be no conflict of\ninterests between socialist countries. Thus the early predictions of\nMarxism were bold and stunning but they failed. Marxists explained all\ntheir failures: they explained the rising living standards of the\nworking class by devising a theory of imperialism; they even explained\nwhy the first socialist revolution occurred in industrially backward\nRussia. They \u201cexplained\u201d Berlin 1953, Budapest 1956,\nPrague 1968. They \u201cexplained\u201d the Russian-Chinese\nconflict. But their auxiliary hypotheses were all cooked up after the\nevent to protect Marxian theory from the facts. The Newtonian\nprogramme led to novel facts; the Marxian lagged behind the facts and\nhas been running fast to catch up with them. (S&P: 4\u20135.)\n\n\nThus good science is progressive and bad science is degenerating and a\nresearch programme may either begin or end up as such a degenerate\naffair that it ceases to count as science at all. If a research\nprogramme either predicts nothing new or entails novel predictions\nthat never come to pass, then it may have reached such a pitch of\ndegeneration that it has transformed into a pseudoscience.\n\nIt is sometimes suggested that in Lakatos\u2019s opinion no theory\neither is or ought to be abandoned, unless there is a better one in\nexistence (Hacking 1983: 113). Does this mean that no research\nprogramme should be given up in the absence of a progressive\nalternative, no matter how degenerate it may be? If so, this\namounts to the radically anti-sceptical thesis that it is better to\nsubscribe to a theory that bears all the hallmarks of falsehood, such\nas the current representative of a truly degenerate programme, than to\nsit down in undeluded ignorance. (The ancient sceptics, by contrast\nthought that it is better not to believe anything at all\nrather than believe something that might be false.) We are\nnot sure that this was Lakatos\u2019 opinion, though he clearly\nthinks it a mistake to give up on a progressive research\nprogramme, unless there is a better one to shift to. But consider\nagain the case of Marxism. What Lakatos seems to be suggesting in the\npassage quoted above, is that it is rationally\npermissible\u2014perhaps even obligatory\u2014to give up on Marxism\neven if it has no progressive rival, that is, if there is\ncurrently no alternative research programme with a set of\nhard core theses about the fundamental character of capitalism and its\nultimate fate. (After all, the later Lakatos probably subscribed to\nthe Popperian thesis that history in the large is systematically\nunpredictable. In which case there could not be a genuinely\nprogressive programme which foretold the fate of capitalism. At best\nyou could have a conditional theory, such as Piketty\u2019s, which\nsays that under capitalism, inequality is likely to\ngrow\u2014unless something unexpected happens or\nunless we decide to do something about it. See Piketty 2014:\n35.) So although Lakatos thinks that the scientific community seldom\ngives up on a programme until something better comes along, it is not\nclear that he thinks that this is what they always ought to\ndo.\n\nThere are numerous departures from Popperian orthodoxy in all this. To\nbegin with, Lakatos effectively abandons falsifiability as the\nDemarcation Criterion between science and non-science. A research\nprogramme can be falsifiable (in some senses) but unscientific and\nscientific but unfalsifiable. First, the falsifiable non-science.\nEvery successive theory in a degenerating research programme can be\nfalsifiable but the programme as whole may not be scientific. This\nmight happen if it only predicted familiar facts or if its novel\npredictions were never verified. A tired purveyor of old and boring\ntruths and/or a persistent predictor of novel falsehoods might fail to\nmake the scientific grade. Secondly, the non-falsifiable science. In\nLakatos\u2019s opinion, it need not be a crime to insulate the\nhard-core of your research programme from empirical refutation. For\nPopper, it is a sin against science to defend a refuted theory by\n\u201cintroducing ad hoc some auxiliary assumption, or by\nre-interpreting the theory ad hoc in such a way that it\nescapes refutation\u201d (C&R, 48). Not so for Lakatos, though\nthis is not to say that when it comes to ad hocery \u201canything\ngoes\u201d.\n\nThirdly, Lakatos\u2019s Demarcation Criterion is a lot more forgiving\nthan Popper\u2019s. For a start, an inconsistent research\nprogramme need not be condemned to the outer darkness as hopelessly\nunscientific. This is not because any of its constituent theories\nmight be true. Lakatos rejects the Hegelian thesis that there\nare contradictions in reality. \u201cIf science aims at truth, it\nmust aim at consistency; if it resigns consistency, it resigns\ntruth.\u201d But though science aims at truth and therefore\nat consistency, this does not mean that it can\u2019t put up with a\nlittle inconsistency along the way.\n\n\nThe discovery of an inconsistency\u2014or of an anomaly\u2014[need\nnot] immediately stop the development of a programme: it may be\nrational to put the inconsistency into some temporary, ad hoc\nquarantine, and carry on with the positive heuristic of the programme\n(FMSRP: 58).\n\n\nThus it was both rational and scientific for Bohr to persist\nwith his research programme, even though its hard core theses on the\nstructure of the atom were fundamentally inconsistent (FMSRP:\n55\u201358). So although Lakatos rejects Hegel\u2019s claim that\nthere are contradictions in reality (though not, perhaps in Reality),\nhe also rejects Popper\u2019s thesis that because\ncontradictions imply everything, inconsistent theories exclude nothing\nand must therefore be rejected as unfalsifiable and unscientific. For\nLakatos, Bohr\u2019s theory of the atom is fundamentally\ninconsistent, but this does not mean that it implies that the moon is\nmade of green cheese. Thus what Lakatos seems to be suggesting is here\n(though he is not as explicit as he might be) is that, when it comes\nto assessing scientific research programmes, we should sometimes\nemploy a contradiction-tolerant logic; that is a logic that rejects\nthe principle, explicitly endorsed by Popper, that anything whatever\nfollows from a contradiction (FMSRP: 58 n. 2). In today\u2019s\nterminology, Lakatos is a paraconsistentist (since he implicitly\ndenies that from a contradiction anything follows) but not a\ndialetheist (since he explicitly denies that there are true\ncontradictions). Thus he is neither a follower of Popper with respect\nto theories nor a follower of Hegel with respect to reality. (See\nPriest 2006 and 2002, especially ch. 7, and Brown and Priest\n2015.)\n\nThere is another respect in which Lakatos\u2019s Demarcation\nCriterion is more forgiving than Popper\u2019s. For Popper, if a\ntheory is not falsifiable, then it\u2019s not scientific and\nthat\u2019s that. It\u2019s an either/or affair. For Lakatos being\nscientific is a matter of more or less, and the more the less can vary\nover time. A research programme can be scientific at one\nstage, less scientific (or non-scientific) at another (if it ceases to\ngenerate novel predictions and cannot digest its anomalies) but can\nsubsequently stage a comeback, recovering its scientific status. Thus\nthe deliverances of the Criterion are matters of degree, and they are\nmatters of degree that can vary from one time to another. We can\nseldom say absolutely that a research programme is not scientific. We\ncan only say that it is not looking very scientifically healthy\nright now, and that the prospects for a recovery do not look\ngood. Thus Lakatos is much more of a fallibilist than Popper. For\nPopper, we can tell whether a theory is scientific or not by\ninvestigating its logical implications. For Lakatos our best guesses\nmight turn out to be mistaken, since the scientific status of a\nresearch programme is determined, in part, by its history, not just by\nits logical character, and history, as Popper himself proclaimed, is\nessentially unpredictable.\n\nThere is another divergence from Popper which helps to explain the\nabove. Lakatos collapses two of Popper\u2019s distinctions into one;\nthe distinction between science and non-science and the distinction\nbetween good science and bad. As Lakatos himself put the point in his\nlectures at the LSE:\n\n\nThe demarcation problem may be formulated in the following terms: what\ndistinguishes science from pseudoscience? This is an extreme way of\nputting it, since the more general problem, called the Generalized\nDemarcation Problem, is really the problem of the appraisal of\nscientific theories, and attempts to answer the question: when is one\ntheory better than another? We are, naturally, assuming a continuous\nscale whereby the value zero corresponds to a pseudo-scientific theory\nand positive values to theories considered scientific in a higher or\nlesser degree. (F&AM: 20)\n\n\nApart from the fact that, for Lakatos, a) it can be rational to\npersist with a \u201cfalsified\u201d theory, and indeed with theory\nthat is actually inconsistent\u2014both anathema to Popper\u2014and\nthat b) that for Lakatos \u201call theories are born refuted and die\nrefuted\u201d (S&P: 5) so that there are no unrefuted\nconjectures for the virtuous scientist to stick with (thus making what\nPopper would regard as good science practically impossible),\nLakatos\u2019s methodology of scientific research programmes replaces\ntwo of Popper\u2019s criteria with one. For Popper has\none criterion to distinguish science from non-science (or\nscience from pseudoscience if it is a theory with scientific\npretensions) and another to distinguish good science from bad\nscience. In Popper\u2019s view, a theory is scientific if it is\nempirically falsifiable and non-scientific if it is not. Being\nscientific or not is an absolute affair, a matter of either/or, since\na theory is scientific so long as there are some observations\nthat would falsify it. Being good science is a matter of\ndegree, since a theory may give more or less hostages to empirical\nfortune, depending on the boldness of its empirical predictions. For\nLakatos on the other hand, non-science or pseudo-science is at one end\nof a continuum with the best science at the other end of the scale.\nThus a theory\u2014or better, a research programme\u2014can start\nout as genuinely scientific, gradually becoming less so over the\ncourse of time (which was Lakatos\u2019s view of Marxism) without\naltogether giving up the scientific ghost. Was the Marxism of\nLakatos\u2019s day bad science or pseudo-science? From Lakatos\u2019\npoint of view, the question does not have a determinate answer, the\npoint being that it isn\u2019t good science since it\nrepresents a degenerating research programme. But although Lakatos\nevidently considered Marxism to be in bad way, he could not consign it\nto the dustbin of history as definitively finished, since (as he often\ninsisted) degenerating research programmes can sometimes stage a\ncomeback.\n3. Works\n3.1 Proofs and Refutations (1963\u20134, 1976)\n\nAs we have seen, Lakatos\u2019s first major publication in Britain\nwas the dialogue \u201cProofs and Refutations\u201d which originally\nappeared as a series of four journal articles. The dialogue is\ndedicated to George P\u00f3lya for his \u201crevival of\nmathematical heuristic\u201d and to Karl Popper for his critical\nphilosophy.\n\nProofs and Refutations is a highly original production. The\nissues it discusses are far removed from what was then standard fare\nin the philosophy of mathematics, dominated by logicism, formalism and\nintuitionism, all attempting to find secure foundations for\nmathematics. Its theses are radical. And its dialogue form makes it a\nliterary as well as a philosophical tour de force.\n\nIts official target is \u201cformalism\u201d or\n\u201cmetamathematics\u201d. But (as we have noted)\n\u201cformalism\u201d doesn\u2019t just mean\n\u201cformalism\u201d proper, as this term is usually understood in\nthe Philosophy of Mathematics. For Lakatos \u201cformalism\u201d\nincludes not just Hilbert\u2019s programme but also logicism and even\nintuitionism. Formalism sees mathematics as the derivation of theorems\nfrom axioms in formalised mathematical theories. The philosophical\nproject is to show that the axioms are true and the proofs valid, so\nthat mathematics can be seen as the accumulation of eternal truths. An\nadditional philosophical question is what these truths are\nabout, the question of mathematical ontology.\n\nLakatos, by contrast, was interested in the growth of\nmathematical knowledge. How were the axioms and the proofs discovered?\nHow does mathematics grow from informal conjectures and proofs into\nmore formal proofs from axioms? Logical empiricist (and Popperian)\northodoxy distinguished the \u201ccontext of discovery\u201d from\nthe \u201ccontext of justification\u201d, consigned the former to\nthe realm of empirical psychology, and thought it a matter of\n\u201cunregimented insight and good fortune\u201d, hardly a fit\nsubject for philosophical analysis. Philosophy of mathematics consists\nof the logical analysis of completed theories. Formalism manifests\nthis orthodoxy and \u201cdisconnects the history of mathematics from\nthe philosophy of mathematics\u201d (P&R: 1). Against the\northodoxy, Lakatos paraphrased Kant (the paraphrase has become almost\nas famous as the original):\n\n\nthe history of mathematics\u2026has become blind, while the\nphilosophy of mathematics\u2026 has become empty. (P&R:\n2)\n\n\n[Lakatos had stated this Kantian aphorism more generally at a\nconference in Oxford in 1961: \u201cHistory of science without\nphilosophy of science is blind. Philosophy of science without history\nof science is empty\u201d. See Hanson 1963: 458.]\n\nSuppose we agree with Lakatos that there is room for heuristics or a\nlogic or discovery. Still, orthodoxy could insist that discovery is\none thing, justification another, and that the genesis of ideas has\nnothing to do with their justification. Lakatos, more radically,\ndisputed this. First, he rejected the foundationalist or\njustificationist project altogether: mathematics has no foundation in\nlogic, or set theory, or anything else. Second, he insisted that the\nway in which a theory grows plays an essential role in its\nmethodological appraisal. This is as much a central theme of his\nphilosophy of empirical science as it is of his philosophy of\nmathematics.\n\nAs noted above, Proofs and Refutations takes the form of an\nimaginary dialogue between a teacher and a group of students. It\nreconstructs the history of attempts to prove the Descartes-Euler\nconjecture about polyhedra, namely, that for all polyhedra, the number\nof vertices minus the number of edges plus the\nnumber of faces is two (V \u2013 E + F = 2). The\nteacher presents an informal proof of this conjecture, due to Cauchy.\nThis is a \u201cthought experiment which suggest a decomposition\nof the original conjecture into subconjectures or lemmas\u201d\nfrom which the original conjecture is supposed to follow. We now have,\nas well as the original conjecture or conclusion, the subconjectures\nor premises, and the meta-conjecture that the latter entail the\nformer. Clearly, this kind of \u201cinformal proof\u201d is quite\ndifferent from the \u201cformalist\u201d idea that an informal proof\nis a formal proof with gaps (PP2: 63). Equally clearly, any of these\nconjectures might be refuted by counterexamples.\n\nIn the dialogue, the students, who are rather advanced, demonstrate\nthe point\u2014they demolish the Teacher\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d\nby producing counterexamples. The counterexamples are of three\nkinds:\n\n\n(1) Counterexamples to the conclusion that are not also\ncounterexamples to any of the premises (\u201cglobal but not local\ncounterexamples\u201d): These establish that the conclusion does not\nreally follow from the stated premises. They require us to improve the\nproof, to unearth the \u201chidden lemma\u201d which the\ncounterexample also refutes, so that it becomes a \u201clocal as well\nas global\u201d counterexample\u2014see (3), below.\n\n(2) Counterexamples to one of the premises that are not also\ncounterexamples to the conclusion (\u201clocal but not global\ncounterexamples\u201d): These require us to improve the proof by\nreplacing the refuted premise with a new premise which is not subject\nto the counterexample and which (we hope) will do as much to establish\nthe conclusion as the original refuted premise did.\n\n(3) Counterexamples both to the conclusion and to (at least one of)\nthe premises (\u201cglobal and local counterexamples\u201d): These\ncan be dealt with by incorporating the refuted premise or lemma into\nthe original conclusion, as a condition of its correctness. For\nexample, a picture-frame is a polyhedron with a hole or tunnel in\nit:\n\n\n\n\nSo if we define a polyhedron as \u201cnormal\u201d if it has no\nholes or tunnels in it, we can restrict the original conjecture to\n\u201cnormal\u201d polyhedra and avoid this refutation. The trouble\nwith this method is that it reduces the content of the original\nconjecture, and an empty tautology threatens\u2014\u201cFor all\nEulerian polyhedra (polyhedra for which \\(V - E + F = 2\\)V\n\u2013 E + F = 2), V \u2013 E + F = 2\\(V - E +\nF = 2\\)\u201d. More particularly, a blanket exclusion of polyhedra\nwith holes or tunnels rules out some polyhedra for which \\(V - E + F =\n2\\), despite the presence of a hole\u2014a cube with a\nsquare hole drilled through it and two ring-shaped faces being an\nexample \u2013 the formula V \u2013 E + F = 2 holds\ngood. This suggests a deeper problem than finding the domain of\nvalidity of the original conjecture\u2014finding a general\nrelationship between V, E and F for all polyhedra\nwhatsoever.\n\n\nWe see from this analysis what Lakatos calls the \u201cdialectical\nunity of proofs and refutations\u201d. Counterexamples help us to\nimprove our proof by finding hidden lemmas. And proofs help us improve\nour conjecture by finding conditions on its validity. Either way, or\nboth ways, mathematical knowledge grows. And as it grows, its concepts\nare refined. We begin with a vague, unarticulated notion of what a\npolyhedron is. We have a conjecture about polyhedra and an informal\nproof of it. Counterexamples or refutations \u201cstretch\u201d our\noriginal concept: is a picture frame a genuine polyhedron, or a\ncylinder, or two polyhedra joined along a single edge?\n\n\n\n\nAttempts to rescue our conjecture from refutation yield\n\u201cproof-generated definitions\u201d like that of a \u201cnormal\npolyhedron\u201d.\n\nIs there any limit to this process of\n\u201cconcept-stretching\u201d, or any distinction to be drawn\nbetween interesting and frivolous concept-stretching? Can this process\nyield, not fallible conjectures and proofs, but certainty?\nLakatos\u2019s editors distinguish the certainty of proofs from the\ncertainty of the axioms from which all proofs must proceed. They claim\nthat rigorous proof-procedures have been attained, and that\n\u201cThere is no serious sense in which such proofs are\nfallible\u201d (P&R: 57). Quite so. But only because we have\ndecided not to \u201cstretch\u201d the logical concepts that lie\nbehind those rigorous and formalizable proof-procedures. A rigorous\nproof in classical logic may not be valid in intuitionistic or\nparaconsistent logics. And the key point is that a proof, however\nrigorous, only establishes that if the axioms are true,\nthen so is the theorem. If the axioms themselves remain\nfallible, then so do the theorems rigorously derived from them.\nProviding foundations for mathematics requires the axioms to be made\ncertain, by deriving them from logic or set theory or something else.\nLakatos claimed that this foundational project had collapsed (see\nbelow,\n \u00a73.2).\n\nTo what extent is this imaginary dialogue a contribution to the\nhistory of mathematics? Lakatos explained that\n\n\nThe dialogue form should reflect the dialectic of the story: it is\nmeant to contain a sort of rationally reconstructed or\n\u201cdistilled\u201d history. The real history will chime in in the\nfootnotes, most of which are to be taken, therefore, as an organic\npart of the essay (P&R: 5).\n\n\nThis device, first necessitated by the dialogue form, became a\npervasive theme of Lakatos\u2019s writings. It was to attract much\ncriticism, most of it centred around the question whether rationally\nreconstructed history was real history at all. The trouble is that the\nrational and the real can come apart quite radically. At one point in\nProofs and Refutations a character in the dialogue makes a\nhistorical claim which, according to the relevant footnote, is false.\nLakatos says that the statement\n\n\nalthough heuristically correct (i.e. true in a rational\nhistory of mathematics) is historically false. This should not worry\nus: actual history is frequently a caricature of its rational\nreconstructions. (P&R: 21)\n\n\nOn occasions, Lakatos\u2019s sense of humour ran away with him, as\nwhen the text contains a made-up quotation from Galileo, and the\nfootnote says that he \u201cwas unable to trace this quotation\u201d\n(P&R: 62). (Though this does rather smack of his youthful habit of\nwinning arguments with \u201cbourgeois\u201d students by fabricating\non-the-spot quotations from the authorities they respected. See Bandy\n2009: 122.) Horrified critics protested that rationally reconstructed\nhistory is a caricature of real history, not in fact real history at\nall but rather \u201cphilosophy fabricating examples\u201d. One\ncritic said that philosophers of science should not be allowed to\nwrite history of science. This academic trade unionism is misguided.\nYou do not falsify history by pointing out that what ought to have\nhappened did not, in fact, happen.\n\nThere is an important pedagogic point to all this, too. The dialectic\nof proofs and refutations can generate, in the ways explained above,\nquite complicated definitions of mathematical concepts, definitions\nthat can only really be understood by considering the process that\ngave rise to them. But mathematics teaching is not historical, or even\nquasi-historical. (One sense in which Lakatos\u2019s theory is\ndialectical: it represents a process as rational even though the terms\nof the debate are not clearly defined.) But students nowadays are\npresented with the latest definitions at the outset, and required to\nlearn them and apply them, without ever really understanding them.\n\nOne question about Proofs and Refutations is whether the\nheuristic patterns depicted in it apply to the whole of mathematics.\nWhile some aspects clearly are peculiar to the particular case-study\nof polyhedra, the general patterns are not. Lakatos himself applied\nthem in a second case-study, taken from the history of analysis in the\nnineteenth century (\u201cCauchy and the Continuum\u201d,\n1978c).\n3.2 \u201cRegress\u201d and \u201cRenaissance\u201d\n\nThe onslaught on formalism continues in a pair of papers\n\u201cInfinite Regress and the Foundations of Mathematics\u201d\n(1962) and \u201cA Renaissance of Empiricism in the Recent Philosophy\nof Mathematics?\u201d (1967a). Here Popper predominates and Hegel\nrecedes. Regress is a critique of both logicism and\nformalism proper (that is, Hilbert\u2019s programme), concentrating\nprimarily on Russell. Russell sought to rescue mathematics from doubt\nand uncertainty by deriving the totality of mathematics from\nself-evident logical axioms via stipulative definitions and\nwater-tight rules of inference. But the discovery of Russell\u2019s\nParadox and the felt need to deal with the Liar and related paradoxes\nblew this ambition sky-high. For some of the axioms that Russell was\nforced to posit\u2014the Theory of Types which Lakatos sees, in\neffect, as a monster-barring definition (elevated into an axiom) that\navoids the paradoxes by excluding self-referential propositions as\nmeaningless; the Axiom of Reducibility which is needed to relax the\nunduly restrictive Theory of Types; the Axiom of Infinity which posits\nan infinity of objects in order to ensure that every natural number\nhas a successor; and the Axiom of Choice (which Russell refers to as\nthe multiplicative axiom)\u2014were either not self-evident,\nnot logical or both. Russell\u2019s fall-back position was\nto argue that mathematics was not justified by being derivable from\nhis axioms but that his axioms were justified because the truths of\nmathematics could be derived from them whilst avoiding\ncontradictions:\n\n\nWhen pure mathematics is organized as a deductive system\u2026it\nbecomes obvious that, if we are to believe in the truth of pure\nmathematics, it cannot be solely because we believe in the truth of\nthe set of premises. Some of the premises are much less obvious than\nsome of their consequences, and are believed chiefly because of their\nconsequences. (Russell 2010 [1918]: 129)\n\n\nAs Lakatos amply documents in Renaissance, a\nsurprising number of labourers in the foundationalist\nvinyard\u2014Carnap and Quine, Fraenkel and G\u00f6del, Mostowski and\nvon Neumann\u2014were prepared to make similar noises. Lakatos dubs\nthis development \u201cempiricism\u201d (or\n\u201cquasi-empiricism\u201d) and hails it on the one hand whilst\ncondemning it on the other.\n\nWhy \u201cempiricism\u201d? Not because it revives Mill\u2019s idea\nthat the truths of arithmetic are empirical generalizations, but\nbecause it ascribes to mathematics the same kind of\nhypothetico-deductive structure that the empirical sciences supposedly\ndisplay, with axioms playing the part of theories and their\nmathematical consequences playing the part of observation-statements\n(or in Lakatos\u2019s terminology, \u201cpotential\nfalsifiers\u201d).\n\nWhy does Lakatos hail the \u201cempiricism\u201d that he also\ncondemns? Because it means that mathematics has the same kind\nepistemic structure that science has according to Popper. It\u2019s a\nmatter of axiomatic conjectures that can be mathematically refuted.\n(The difference between science and mathematics consists in the\ndifferences between the potential falsifiers.)\n\nWhy does Lakatos condemn the \u201cempiricism\u201d that he also\ncommends? Because Russell, like most of his supporters, succumbs to\nthe \u201cinductivist\u201d illusion that the axioms can be\nconfirmed by the truth of their consequences. In Lakatos\u2019s\nopinion this is simply a mistake. Truth can trickle down from the\naxioms to their consequences and falsity can flow upwards from the\nconsequences to the axioms (or at least to the axiom set). But neither\ntruth nor probability nor justified belief can flow up from the\nconsequences to the axioms from which they follow. Here Lakatos\nout-Poppers Popper, portraying not just science but even mathematics\nas a collection of unsupported conjectures that can be refuted but not\nconfirmed, anything else being condemned as to\n\u201cinductivism\u201d. However the inductivism that Lakatos\nscornfully rejects in Renaissance is just the kind of\ninductivism that he would be recommending to Popper just a few years\nlater.\n3.3 \u201cChanges in the Problem of Inductive Logic\u201d (1968)\n\nIn 1964 Lakatos turned from the history and philosophy of mathematics\nto the history and philosophy of the empirical sciences. He organised\na famous International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, held\nin London in 1965. Participants included Tarski, Quine, Carnap, Kuhn,\nand Popper. The Proceedings ran to four volumes (Lakatos (ed.) 1967\n& 1968, and Lakatos and Musgrave (eds.) 1968 & 1970). Lakatos\nhimself contributed three major papers to these proceedings. The first\nof these (Renaissance) has been dealt with already.\nThe second, \u201cChanges in the Problem of Inductive Logic\u201d\n(Changes), analyses the debate between Carnap and\nPopper regarding the relations between theory and evidence in science.\nIt is remarkable both for its conclusions and for its methodology. The\nconclusion, to put it bluntly, is that a certain brand of inductivism\nis bunk. The prospects for an inductive logic that allows you to\nderive scientific theories from sets of observation statements, thus\nproviding them with a weak or probabilistic justification, are dim\nindeed. There is no inductive logic according to which real-life\nscientific theories can be inferred, \u201cpartially proved\u201d or\n\u201cconfirmed (by facts) to a certain degree\u201d\u2019\n(Changes: 133). But Lakatos sought to prove his point\nby analysing the Popper/Carnap debate and reversing the common verdict\nthat Carnap had won and that Popper had lost. And here he faced a\nproblem. As Fox (1981) explains:\n\n\nThe facts on which the verdict was based were that Popper\u2019s\nclaimed refutations of Carnap all failed, through either fallacy or\nmisrepresentation, and that Carnap was a careful, precise, irenic\nthinker, in the habit of stating as his conclusions exactly what his\npremises warranted. The standards on which the verdict was based were\nthe respectable professional ones by which we mark third-year essays.\nThe verdict was: Carnap gets an A+, and Popper\u2019s refusal to\nwither away is a moral and intellectual embarrassment. (Fox 1981:\n94.)\n\n\nLakatos\u2019s strategy was to accept the facts but reverse the\nvalue-judgment by developing the twin concepts of a degenerating\nresearch programme and a degenerating problem-shift and\napplying them to Carnap\u2019s successive endeavours. But\nCarnap\u2019s programme was philosophico-mathematical rather than\nscientific. So what was wrong with it could not be that it failed to\npredict novel facts or that its predictions were mostly falsified. For\nit was not in the business of predicting empirical observations\nwhether novel or otherwise. (Indeed Lakatos\u2019s concept of a\ndegenerating philosophical programme seems to have preceded\nhis concept of a degenerating scientific programme.) So what\nwas wrong with Carnap\u2019s enterprise? In an effort to solve his\noriginal problem, Carnap had to solve a series of sub-problems. Some\nwere solved, others were not, generating sub-sub-problems of their\nown. Some of these were solved, others were not, generating\nsub-sub-sub-problems and sub-sub-sub-sub-problems etc. Since some of\nthese sub-problems (or sub-sub-problems) were solved, the programme\nappeared to its proponents be busy and progressive. But it was\ndrifting further and further away from achieving its original\nobjectives.\n\nNow for Lakatos, such problem-shifts are not necessarily degenerating.\nIf a programme ends up solving a problem that it did not set out to\nsolve, that is all fine and dandy so long as the problem that it\nsucceeds in solving is more interesting and important than the problem\nthat it did set out to solve.\n\n\nBut one may solve problems less interesting than the original one;\nindeed, in extreme cases, one may end up solving (or trying to solve)\nno other problems but those which one has oneself created while trying\nto solve the original problem. In such cases we may talk about a\ndegenerating problem-shift. (Changes:\n128\u20139.)\n\n\nThus Carnap starts off with the exciting problem of showing how\nscientific theories can be partially confirmed by empirical facts and\nends up with technical papers about drawing different coloured balls\nout of an urn. In Lakatos\u2019s opinion this does not constitute\nintellectual progress. Carnap had lost the plot.\n3.4 \u201cFalsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes\u201d (1970)\n\nThe best-known of Lakatos\u2019s \u201cConference Proceedings\u201d\nis Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge, which became an\ninternational best-seller. It contains Lakatos\u2019s important paper\n\u201cFalsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research\nProgrammes\u201d (FMSRP) which we have discussed already. A briefer\naccount of this methodology had already appeared (Lakatos 1968a), in\nwhich Lakatos distinguished dogmatic, na\u00efve and sophisticated\nfalsificationist positions, attributing them to\n\u201cPopper0, Popper1 and\nPopper2\u201d\u2014or as he otherwise put it,\n\u201cproto-Popper, pseudo-Popper and proper-Popper\u201d. (Popper\ndid not appreciate being disassembled into temporal or ideological\nparts and protested \u201cI am not a Trinity\u201d.)\n\nLakatos\u2019s methodology has been seen, rightly, as an attempt to\nreconcile Popper\u2019s falsificationism with the views of Thomas\nKuhn. Popper saw science as consisting of bold explanatory\nconjectures, and dramatic refutations that led to new conjectures.\nKuhn (and Polanyi before him) objected that\n\n\nNo process yet disclosed by the historical study of scientific\ndevelopment at all resembles the methodological stereotype of\nfalsification by direct comparison with nature (Kuhn 1962: 77).\n\n\nInstead, science consists of long periods of \u201cnormal\nscience\u201d, paradigm-based research, where the task is to force\nnature to fit the paradigm. When nature refuses to comply, this is not\nseen as a refutation, but rather as an anomaly. It casts doubt, not on\nthe ruling paradigm, but on the ingenuity of the\nscientists\u2014\u201conly the practitioner is blamed, not his\ntools\u201d. It is only in extraordinary periods of\n\u201crevolutionary science\u201d that anything like Popperian\nrefutations occur.\n\nLakatos proposed a middle-way, in which Kuhn\u2019s\nsocio-psychological tools were replaced by logico-methodological ones.\nThe basic unit of appraisal is not the isolated testable theory, but\nrather the \u201cresearch programme\u201d within which a series of\ntestable theories is generated. Each theory produced within a research\nprogramme contains the same common or \u201chard core\u201d\nassumptions, surrounded by a \u201cprotective belt\u201d of\nauxiliary hypotheses. When a particular theory is refuted, adherents\nof a programme do not pin the blame on their hard-core assumptions,\nwhich they render \u201cirrefutable by fiat\u201d. Instead,\ncriticism is directed at the hypotheses in the \u201cprotective\nbelt\u201d and they are modified to deal with the problem.\nImportantly, these modifications are not random\u2014they are in the\nbest cases guided by the heuristic principles implicit in the\n\u201chard core\u201d of the programme. A programme progresses\ntheoretically if the new theory solves the anomaly faced by the old\nand is independently testable, making new predictions. A programme\nprogresses empirically if at least one of these new predictions is\nconfirmed.\n\nNotice that a programme can make progress, both theoretically and\nempirically, even though every theory produced within it is refuted. A\nprogramme degenerates if its successive theories are not\ntheoretically progressive (because it predicts no novel\nfacts), or not empirically progressive (because novel\npredictions get refuted). Furthermore, and contrary to Kuhn\u2019s\nidea that normally science is dominated by a single paradigm, Lakatos\nclaimed that the history of science typically consists of\ncompeting research programmes. A scientific revolution occurs\nwhen a degenerating programme is superseded by a progressive one. It\nacquires hegemonic status though its rivals may persist as minority\nreports.\n\nKuhn saw all this as vindicating his own view, albeit with different\nterminology (Kuhn 1970: 256, 1977: 1). But this missed the\nsignificance of replacing Kuhn\u2019s socio-psychological\ndescriptions with logico-methodological ones. It also missed\nLakatos\u2019s claim that there are always competing programmes or\nparadigms. Hegemony is seldom as total as Kuhn seems to suggest.\n3.5 \u201cThe History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions\u201d (1971)\n\nAs we have seen, in Proofs and Refutations Lakatos had\nalready joked that \u201cactual history is frequently a caricature of\nits rational reconstructions\u201d. The use of the\nplural\u2014\u201creconstructions\u201d\u2014is\nimportant. There is more than one way of rationally reconstructing\nhistory, and how you do it depends upon what you count as rational and\nwhat not\u2014it depends, in short, in your theory of rationality.\nThere is not one \u201crational history\u201d\u2014as Hegel may\nhave thought\u2014but several competing ones. And, in a remarkable\ndialectical turn, Lakatos proposed that one can evaluate competing\ntheories of rationality by asking how well they enable one to\nreconstruct the history of science (whether it be mathematics or\nempirical science). The thought is that if your philosophy of science,\nor theory of scientific rationality, deems most of \u201cgreat\nscience\u201d irrational, then something is wrong with it.\nContrariwise, the more of the history of \u201cgreat science\u201d\nyour theory of rationality deems rational, the better that theory\nis.\n\nThe obvious worry is that this meta-criterion for theories of\nscientific rationality threatens to deprive the philosophy of science\nof any critical bite. Will not the best philosophy of science simply\nsay that whatever scientists do is rational, that scientific might is\nright, that the best methodology is Feyerabend\u2019s \u201cAnything\ngoes\u201d? Lakatos\u2019s Kantian epigram \u201cPhilosophy of\nscience without history of science is empty; history of science\nwithout philosophy of science is blind\u201d threatens to eliminate\nthe philosophy of science altogether, in favour of\nhistorical-sociological studies of the decisions of scientific\ncommunities. (One of us discusses this problem, and attempts to disarm\nthe worry, in Musgrave 1983.)\n\nAnother worry, which is perhaps less obvious, is that Lakatos seems to\nbe implicitly appealing to the kind of inductive principle that he\nscorns elsewhere. Isn\u2019t he saying that a sequence of successes\nin the history of science displaying key episodes as rational tends to\nconfirm a theory of scientific rationality?\n\nLakatos himself was a master of philosophically inspired case-studies\nof episodes in the history of science\u2014Feyerabend said he had\nturned this into an art form. His \u201cHegelian\u201d idea that the\n\u201crationally reconstructed\u201d history of thought has primacy\nis emphasised in two books, Larvor 1998 and Kadvany 2001. After his\ndeath, a Colloquium was held in Nafplion, Greece, where case-studies\napplying Lakatos\u2019s ideas to episodes from the history of both\nthe natural and social sciences were presented by his students and\ncolleagues. The Proceedings of this \u201cNafplion Colloquium\u201d\nwere subsequently published in two volumes\u2014Howson (ed.) 1976 and\nLatsis (ed.) 1976. Further case-studies include Zahar 1973 and Urbach\n1974.\n\nHowever, Urbach\u2019s paper, which was written with Lakatos\u2019s\nactive collaboration and encouragement (F&AM: 348\u201334),\nrepresents something of an \u201cown goal\u201d for the MSRP. Urbach\nargued that the environmentalist programme in IQ Studies, which tries\nto explain intergroup differences in tested intelligence as due to\nenvironmental causes, was a degenerating research programme. At least\nit was degenerating when compared to its hereditarian rival which puts\nthese differences down to differences in hereditary endowments. The\ntables were dramatically turned just thirteen years later with the\ndiscovery of the Flynn effect (1987) which showed massive differences\nin intergroup IQs which simply could not be explained by\nhereditary differences. (The groups in question were genetically\nidentical, the higher scoring groups being the children or the\ngrandchildren of the lower scoring groups. See Flynn 1987 and 2009.)\nThus the supposedly \u201cdegenerate\u201d programme was propelled\ninto the lead. Of course the MSRP allows for such dramatic\nreversals of fortune, but it is at least a bit embarrassing if a\nprogramme damned as degenerate by both the Master and one of his chief\ndisciples is spectacularly vindicated just thirteen years later.\n3.6 \u201cPopper on Demarcation and Induction\u201d (1974)\n\n\u201cPopper on demarcation and induction\u201d (PDI) was written in\n1970 for the Popper volume in the Library of Living\nPhilosophers series (Schilpp (ed.) 1974). Sadly, it caused a\nmajor falling out with Popper despite the generous praise in its\nopening sections:\n\n\nPopper\u2019s ideas represent the most important development in the\nphilosophy of the twentieth century; an achievement in the\ntradition\u2014and on the level\u2014of Hume, Kant, or Whewell.\n\u2026 More than anyone else, he changed my life. I was nearly forty\nwhen I got into the magnetic field of his intellect. His philosophy\nhelped me to make a final break with the Hegelian outlook which I had\nheld for nearly twenty years. (PDI: 139.)\n\n\nMuch of the paper is devoted to criticizing Popper\u2019s demarcation\ncriterion and arguing for his own. Most of these criticisms have been\ncanvased already. Lakatos argues, for instance, that Popper\u2019s\nfalsificationism can be falsified\n\n\nby showing that the best scientific achievements were unscientific [by\nPopper\u2019s standards] and that the best scientists, in their\ngreatest moments, broke the rules of Popper\u2019s game of science\n(PDI: 146).\n\n\nBut Lakatos also develops a criticism that has nothing much to do with\nthe differences between his demarcation criterion and Popper\u2019s,\nindeed a criticism that seems equally telling against Popper\u2019s\nphilosophy and his own.\n\nLakatos points out that when Popper first wrote his classic Logik\nder Forschung (LSD) in the early 1930s, the correspondence theory\nof truth was regarded with deep suspicion by the empiricist\nphilosophers that he was trying to convince. Accordingly Popper was\ncareful to state that\n\n\nin the logic of science here outlined it is possible to avoid using\nthe concepts \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d \u2026 We\nneed not say that the theory is \u201cfalse\u201d [or\n\u201cfalsified\u201d], but we may say instead that it is\ncontradicted by a certain set of accepted basic statements. Nor need\nwe say of basic statements that they are \u201ctrue\u201d or\n\u201cfalse\u201d, for we may interpret their acceptance as the\nresult of a conventional decision, and the accepted statements as\nresults of this decision. (LSD: 273\u2013274.)\n\n\nBut shortly thereafter Popper met Tarski who convinced him that the\ncorrespondence theory of truth was philosophically respectable, and\nthis liberated him to declare that truth, or truth-likeness was the\nobject of the scientific enterprise (LSD: 273n). Lakatos apparently\nendorses this development.\n\n\nTarski\u2019s rehabilitation of the correspondence theory of\ntruth\u2026stimulated Popper to complement his logic of discovery\nwith his own theory of verisimilitude and of approximation to the\nTruth, an achievement marvellous both in its simplicity and in its\nproblem-solving power. (PDI: 154.)\n\n\nBut Lakatos points out a problem. There is now a disconnect between\nthe game of science and the aim of science. The\ngame of science consists in putting forward falsifiable,\nrisky and problem-solving conjectures and sticking with the unrefuted\nand the well-corroborated ones. But the aim of science\nconsists in developing true or truth-like theories about a largely\nmind-independent world. And Popper has given us no reason to suppose\nthat by playing the game we are likely to achieve the aim. After all,\na theory can be falsifiable, unfalsified, problem-solving and\nwell-corroborated without being true.\n\nTo restore the connection between the game and its aim Lakatos makes a\nplea with Popper for a \u201cwhiff of\n\u2018inductivism\u2019\u201d (PDI: 159). What is this whiff?\n\n\nAn inductive principle which connects realist metaphysics with\nmethodological appraisals, verisimilitude with corroboration, which\nreinterprets the rules of the \u201cscientific game\u201d as\na\u2014conjectural\u2014theory about the signs of the\ngrowth of knowledge, that is, about the signs of growing\nverisimilitude of our scientific theories (PDI: 156).\n\n\nIn other words, it is a metaphysical principle which states that\nhighly falsifiable but well-corroborated theories are (in some sense)\nmore likely to be true (or truth-like) than their low-risk\ncounterparts. Corroborations tend to confirm. Thus by playing the game\nwe approximate the aim. Lakatos goes on to urge that this whiff of\ninductivism is not much of an ask, since Popper sometimes seems to\npresuppose it without fully realizing that he is doing so.\n\nThere are three points to note.\n\n(1) If this criticism holds good against Popper it is equally good\nagainst Lakatos himself. He too has a disconnect between the\ngame of science\u2014which, when it is played well, consists\nin developing progressive research programmes\u2014and the\naim of science\u2014which, like Popper, he takes to be truth\n(FMSRP: 58). To solve this problem, we need a metaphysical principle\nwhich states that highly progressive research programmes are (in some\nsense) more likely to be true (or truth-like) than their degenerating\nrivals. Thus if Popper could do with a whiff of inductivism, the same\ngoes for Lakatos.\n\n(2) The inductivism that Lakatos recommends to Popper looks remarkably\nlike the inductivism that he condemned in Russell. (\u201cI do not\nsee any way out of a dogmatic assertion that we know the\ninductive principle, or some equivalent; the only alternative is to\nthrow over almost everything that is regarded as knowledge by science\nand common sense.\u201d Russell 1944: 683, quoted disdainfully by\nLakatos at Regress: 18.) But if inductivism is\npermissible (or even de rigueur) in the Philosophy of\nScience, perhaps it is permissible (or even de rigueur) in\nthe Philosophy of Mathematics! In which case, the Renaissance of\nEmpiricism in the Philosophy of Mathematics may count as a genuine\nrenaissance after all, since the logical or set-theoretic axioms may\n(as Russell supposed) be confirmed (and hence rationally believed)\nbecause of their mathematical consequences. If epistemic support can\nflow upwards from evidence to theory (where the evidence consists of a\nsequence of novel and successful predictions), perhaps it can flow\nupwards from consequences to axioms.\n\n(3) This episode undermines an influential \u201cHegelian\u201d\nreading of Lakatos due to Ian Hacking. According to Hacking,\n\n\nLakatos, educated in Hungary in an Hegelian and Marxist tradition,\ntook for granted the post-Kantian, Hegelian, demolition of\ncorrespondence theories (Hacking 1983: 118).\n\n\nThis is an odd assertion as Lakatos explicitly endorses the\ncorrespondence theory on a number of occasions and even declares truth\nto be the aim of science, which is why contradictions are intolerable\nin the long term (FMSRP: 58). But in Hacking\u2019s view, Lakatos\nwas\n\n\ndown on truth, not just a particular theory of truth. He [did] not\nwant a replacement for the correspondence theory, but a replacement\nfor truth itself (Hacking 1983: 119).\n\n\nHe found his replacement in the concept of progress.\n\n\nLakatos then defines objectivity and rationality in terms of\nprogressive research programmes, and allows an incident in the history\nof science to be objective and rational if its internal history can be\nwritten as a sequence of progressive problem shifts (Hacking 1983:\n126).\n\n\nProgress becomes a surrogate for truth. We don\u2019t ask whether a\ntheory is true or not but only whether it is part of a progressive\nprogramme. To paraphrase the young Karl Popper,\n\n\nin the logic of science [that Lakatos has] outlined it is possible to\navoid using the concepts \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201cfalse\u201d\n[which, in Lakatos\u2019s opinion, is a jolly good thing!] (LSD:\n273).\n\n\nBut if Lakatos had really been such an anti-truth-freak, he would not\nhave congratulated Popper on his Tarskian turn. Rather he would have\ncondemned him for taking the vacuous concept of truth to be the aim of\nscience. As for the disconnect between the aim of science and\nthe game of science, he would have recommended that Popper\nresolve it by dropping the aim and substituting the game (which,\naccording to Hacking, was what Lakatos himself was trying to do). If\ntruth were not the object of the exercise, there would be no need for\na whiff of inductivism to connect Popper\u2019s method with\nscience\u2019s ultimate objective. But Lakatos did think\nthat a whiff of inductivism was needed to connect Popper\u2019s\nmethod with science\u2019s objective. Hence Lakatos believed that\ntruth was the object of the scientific enterprise. Whatever the\nremnants of Hegelianism that Lakatos retained in later life, an\naversion to truth (or to the correspondence theory of truth ) was not\none of them.\n3.7 \u201cWhy Did Copernicus\u2019s Research Programme Supersede Ptolemy\u2019s?\u201d (1976)\n\nLakatos\u2019s last publication was an historical a case-study,\nco-authored with Elie Zahar and published after his death. It argues\nthat the methodology of scientific research programmes can explain the\nCopernican Revolution as a rational process by which an earlier theory\n(Ptolemy\u2019s geocentric theory of the Cosmos) was dethroned in\nfavour another objectively better one (Copernicus\u2019s heliocentric\ntheory). It thus demonstrates the rationality of the Copernican\nRevolution (one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of\nthought) and confirms the MSRP as a theory of scientific rationality\n(so long as we accept the inductive principle that the more\n\u201cgreat science\u201d that a demarcation criterion can represent\nas rational, the more likely it is to be correct).\n\nApart from the intrinsic interest of the subject, the paper marks a\nmodification of Lakatos\u2019s conception of factual novelty and\nhence a modification to the MSRP. For the earlier Lakatos, a fact\ncounts as novel with respect to a research programme if it is not\npredicted by any of its rivals and if it is not already known. In\nWDCRPSP Lakatos accepts an amendment due to his co-author Elie Zahar.\nZahar\u2019s original problem was our old friend the Precession of\nMercury. This was explained by Einstein\u2019s\nprogramme\u2014specifically the General Theory of\nRelativity\u2014but not by Newton\u2019s, and this was generally\nthought to count in Einstein\u2019s favour. The difficulty is that in\nLakatos\u2019s lexicon the Precession of Mercury did not count as a\nnovel fact. After all it had been known to astronomers for nearly a\ncentury. Thus, given the original version of the MSRP, the discovery\nthat that the General Theory could explain the Precession of Mercury\n(whilst Newton\u2019s theory could not) did not mean that\nEinstein\u2019s programme was any more progressive than\nNewton\u2019s. (That had to be argued on other grounds.) But\nthis is such a counterintuitive result that it suggests a defect in\nthe MSRP. Zahar\u2019s modification is that a fact counts as a novel\nprediction with respect to a research programme if a) it is not\npredicted by any of the programme\u2019s rivals and b) either it is\nnot already known or if it is already known, the\nhard core of the programme was not devised to explain it.\n\nBy this modified criterion the Precession of Mercury counts as a novel\nfact with respect to Einstein\u2019s programme. For the General\nTheory was designed to solve a different set of problems. The\nprediction that if the General Theory were correct, the perihelion of\nMercury would shift as it does without the influence of any other\nheavenly body came as an \u201cunexpected present from\nSchwarzschild\u201d (the man who did the sums). It was therefore\n\u201can unintended by-product of Einstein\u201ds programme\u2019\n(WDCRPSP: 185). So despite its antiquity, the Precession of Mercury\ncounts as a novel fact or a novel prediction with respect to\nEinstein\u2019s programme, thus making the programme a lot more\nprogressive. Some might regard Zahar\u2019s amendment as a\nsuspiciously ad hoc move, but ad hoc or not, it\nlooks like an improvement on the original MSRP. Lakatos and Zahar go\non to use this idea to explain why Copernicus\u2019s programme very\nproperly superseded Ptolemy\u2019s.\n4. Mincemeat Unmade: Lakatos versus Feyerabend\n\nAccording to his friend Paul Feyerabend, Lakatos was \u201cwas a\nfascinating person, an outstanding thinker and the best philosopher of\nscience of our strange and uncomfortable century\u201d (Feyerabend\n1975a: 1). Writing in 1981, John Fox raised a cynical eyebrow:\n\n\nAs when Lakatos similarly praises Popper, it is easy to suspect\nindirect self-advertisement: building up one\u2019s opponent so that\nthe announced victory is taken as winning a world title (Fox 1981:\n92).\n\n\nWith Motterlini\u2019s publication of the Feyerabend/Lakatos\ncorrespondence (F&AM), Fox\u2019s suspicions have been amply\nconfirmed. It is quite clear that Lakatos and Feyerabend were engaged\nin a self-conscious campaign of mutual boosterism, leading up to a\nplanned epic encounter between a fallibilistic rationalism, as\nrepresented by Lakatos, and epistemological anarchism, as represented\nby Feyerabend. As Feyerabend put it \u201cI was to attack the\nrationalist position, Imre was to restate and defend it, making\nmincemeat of me in the process\u201d (Feyerabend 1975b: preface).\nThis Battle of the Titans was to consist of Feyerabend\u2019s\nAgainst Method and Lakatos\u2019s projected reply, which is\nreferred to, in their correspondence, by the mysterious acronym\n\u201cMAM\u201d.\n\nSometimes the mutual boosterism went a bit too far, causing pain and\ndistress to serious-minded philosophers who regarded Popperian\ncritical rationalism as a bulwark against a resurgent Nazism:\n\n\nHans Albert is on the verge of suicide [writes Lakatos to Feyerabend].\nAllegedly somebody told him that in Kiel you will describe critical\nrationalism as a \u201cmental disease\u201d, and he thinks that will\nbe the end of Reason in Germany. I told him that though you are AN\nEXTREMELY GREAT MAN, that you will not bring Nazism back\nsingle-handedly\u2026. (F&AM: 291).\n\n\nBut although they had interested motives for talking each other up, it\nis clear that the mutual admiration between Feyerabend and Lakatos was\nquite sincere. Each genuinely regarded the other as the man to\nbeat.\n\nFeyerabend\u2019s criticism of Lakatos is summed up in his joking\ndedication to Against Method: To IMRE LAKATOS Friend and\nFellow-Anarchist. In other words Feyerabend\u2019s charge is\nthat for all his law-and-order pretensions as a defender of the\nrationality of science and a critic of pseudoscience, Lakatos is\nreally an epistemic anarchist malgr\u00e9 lui.\nFeyerabend\u2019s epistemological anarchism is sometimes summed up by\nthe slogan \u201cAnything goes\u201d but that is a little\nmisleading. His point is rather this: If you want a set of\nmethodological rules distinguishing between good science and bad\nscience, the only thing that won\u2019t exclude some of\nwhat you (Dear Reader) regard as the best science is the\nprinciple \u201cAnything goes\u201d. Anything else would rule out\nwhat is widely regarded as some of the best science as unscientific.\nThus a large proportion of Feyerabend\u2019s Against Method\nis devoted to \u201cpraising\u201d Galileo for his allegedly\nanti-Popperian practices and his dodgy (but progressive) rhetorical\ntricks. Everyone agrees that Galileo was a great scientist. But if\nGalileo was great, then the rules that supposedly constitute great\nscience are defective since they would exclude some of the greatest of\nGalileo\u2019s great deeds.\n\nBut what about Lakatos? Feyerabend poses a dilemma. Suppose we apply\nthe Lakatos\u2019s methodology of scientific research programmes in a\nconservative or rigouristic spirit. Scientists are urged to abandon\ndegenerating research programmes in favour of the progressive, and\ngrant-giving agencies are urged to defund them. After all, such\nprogrammes are condemned by the Demarcation Criterion as bad\nscience or even non-science! At the very least, the adherents\nof degenerating research programmes must bear the stigma of\nirrationality, owning up to their scientific sins. But in that case\nLakatos\u2019s MSRP would be condemning some research programmes to\ndeath as bad science or even non-science that might otherwise recover\ntheir progressive (and hence their scientific) status. Thus Lakatos\nwould be vulnerable to the same criticism that he himself applies to\nPopper\u2014he would be excluding some of the best science as\nunscientific (that is, research programmes that have suffered a\ndegenerating phase only to stage a magnificent comeback). In response\nto this, Lakatos distinguished appraisal from advice, and said that\nthe task of the philosopher of science is to issue rules of appraisal,\nnot to advise scientists (or grant-giving agencies) about what they\nought to do. The Demarcation Criterion can evaluate the current state\nof play but it does not tell anyone what to do about it. (To\nparaphrase Marx\u2019s Thesis XI, \u201cMethodologists hitherto have\nattempted to change the world of scientific research in\nvarious ways; the point, however is to appraise it\u201d.)\nThe MSRP does enjoin a principle of scientific honesty, namely that\nthe adherents of degenerating research programmes should own up to\ntheir methodological shortcomings, such as the lack of novel\npredictions or the falsification of the predictions that they have\nmade. However, so long as they admit to these failures they can\n(rationally?) persist in their degenerate ways.\n\nBut in that case Lakatos is gored by the other horn of\nFeyerabend\u2019s dilemma. For Feyerabend argues that a Demarcation\nCriterion that cannot tell anyone what to do or not to do is scarcely\ndistinguishable from \u201cAnything goes\u201d. To revert to\nFeyerabend\u2019s political analogy, what is the difference between\nan anarchist society and a \u201cstate\u201d where the\n\u201cpolice\u201d can appraise people for their\n\u201ccriminal\u201d or \u201claw-abiding\u201d behaviour but can\nnever make an arrest or send anyone to jail? That\u2019s a\n\u201cstate\u201d which isn\u2019t a state and a \u201cpolice\nforce\u201d which isn\u2019t a police force! We have not scientific\nlaw-and-order but anarchy, accompanied by uplifting sermons and\nbenedictions posthumously bestowed on the mighty scientific dead.\n\nWhat was Lakatos\u2019s response to this dilemma? It is sometimes\nsuggested, not least by Feyerabend himself, that Lakatos did have, or\nwould have had, an answer but that he did not live to write it up.\nTheir correspondence suggests otherwise. Although the locus\nclassicus of Feyerabend\u2019s argument is chapter 16 of\nAgainst Method (1975b) he had already developed his dilemma\nin \u201cConsolations for the Specialist\u201d (1968) and Lakatos\nhad access to successive versions of the argument in the successive\ndrafts that Feyerebend sent him in the last is six years of his life.\nYet there is no trace of a counterargument in Lakatos\u2019s\nsurviving letters to Feyerabend. Instead there are a series of\nfearsome threats.\n\n\nI am now greatly grateful for your depicting me as God and\nyourself as the Devil. I also return the compliment: for me\nyou are the only philosopher worth demolishing. But there is\none trouble: I can take you to such little pieces\nthat only an electromicroscope can discover you again. Will you be\nvery hurt? (F&AM: 268\u20139.)\n\n\nHowever, aside from these threats, a developed answer to\nFeyerabend\u2019s dilemma is conspicuous by its absence. One is\nreminded of King Lear:\n\n\nI will do such things,\u2014\n\nWhat they are, yet I know not: but they shall be\n\nThe terrors of the earth.\n\n\nThe upshot is that if there is a Lakatosian answer to\nFeyerabend\u2019s dilemma, it is an answer that has to be concocted\non his behalf. One of us has a go in Musgrave 1976, but for the\nMethodology of Scientific Research Programmes, it is still, very much,\nan open problem.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Lakatos", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Lakatos": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "1946a: \u201cCitoyen \u00e9s Munk\u00e1soszt\u00e1ly\u201d\n(Citoyen and the working class), <em>Val\u00f3s\u00e1g</em>, 1:\n77\u201388.", "1946b: \u201cA fizikai Idealizmus B\u00edr\u00e1lata\u201d\n(A critique of idealism in physics); a review of Susan\nStebbing\u2019s <em>Philosophy and the Physicists</em>,\n<em>Athenaeum</em>, 1: 28\u201333.", "1947a: \u201cHuszadik Sz\u00e1zad\u201d, <em>Forum</em>, 1:\n316\u201320.", "1947b: \u201cE\u00f6tv\u00f6s Coll\u00e9gium\u2014Gy\u00f6rffy\nKoll\u00e9gium\u201d, <em>Val\u00f3s\u00e1g</em>, 2:\n107\u201324.", "1947c: \u201cJeges K\u00e1roly: <em>Megtanulom a\nfizik\u00e1t\u201d</em>, T\u00e1rsadalmi Szemle, 1: 472.", "1947d: \u201cTerm\u00e9szettudom\u00e1nyos\nvil\u00e1gn\u00e9zet \u00e9s demokratikus nevel\u00e9s\u201d\n(Scientific worldview and democratic upbringing),\n<em>Embernevel\u00e9s</em>, 2: 63\u201366.", "1947e: \u201cModern fizika\u2014modern t\u00e1rsadalom\u201d\n(Modern physics\u2014modern society), in Kem\u00e9ny G\u00e1bor\n(ed.), <em>Tov\u00e1bbk\u00e9pz\u00e9s \u00e9s\ndemokr\u00e1cia</em>.
