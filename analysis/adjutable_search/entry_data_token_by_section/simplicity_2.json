A Priori Justifications of Simplicity\n\nThe role of simplicity as a theoretical virtue seems so widespread,\nfundamental, and implicit that many philosophers, scientists, and\ntheologians have sought a justification for principles such as Occam\u2019s\nRazor on similarly broad and basic grounds. This rationalist approach\nis connected to the view that making a priori simplicity\nassumptions is the only way to get around the underdetermination of\ntheory by data. Until the second half of the 20th Century\nthis was probably the predominant approach to the issue of simplicity.\nMore recently, the rise of empiricism within analytic philosophy led\nmany philosophers to argue disparagingly that a priori\njustifications keep simplicity in the realm of metaphysics (see\nZellner et al. 2001, p.1). Despite its changing fortunes, the\nrationalist approach to simplicity still has its adherents. For\nexample, Richard Swinburne writes:\n\nI seek\u2026to show that\u2014other things being equal\u2014the\nsimplest hypothesis proposed as an explanation of phenomena is more\nlikely to be the true one than is any other available hypothesis, that\nits predictions are more likely to be true than those of any other\navailable hypothesis, and that it is an ultimate a priori\nepistemic principle that simplicity is evidence for truth (Swinburne\n1997, p. 1).\n\n3.1 Theological Justifications\n\nThe post-medieval period coincided with a gradual transition from\ntheology to science as the predominant means of revealing the workings\nof nature. In many cases, espoused principles of parsimony continued\nto wear their theological origins on their sleeves, as with Leibniz\u2019s\nthesis that God has created the best and most complete of all possible\nworlds, and his linking of this thesis to simplifying principles such\nas light always taking the (time-wise) shortest path. A similar\nattitude\u2014and rhetoric\u2014is shared by scientists through the\nearly modern and modern period, including Kepler, Newton, and\nMaxwell.\n\nSome of this rhetoric has survived to the present day, especially\namong theoretical physicists and cosmologists such as Einstein and\n Hawking.[9]\n Yet there are clear dangers with relying on a theological\njustification of simplicity principles. Firstly, many\u2014probably\nmost\u2014contemporary scientists are reluctant to link\nmethodological principles to religious belief in this way. Secondly,\neven those scientists who do talk of \u2018God\u2019 often turn out\nto be using the term metaphorically, and not necessarily as referring\nto the personal and intentional Being of monotheistic religions.\nThirdly, even if there is a tendency to justify simplicity principles\nvia some literal belief in the existence of God, such justification is\nonly rational to the extent that rational arguments can be given for\nthe existence of\n God.[10]\n\nFor these reasons, few philosophers today are content to rest with a\ntheological justification of simplicity principles. Yet there is no\ndoubting the influence such justifications have had on past and\npresent attitudes to simplicity. As Smart (1994) writes:\n\nThere is a tendency\u2026for us to take simplicity\u2026as a guide\nto metaphysical truth. Perhaps this tendency derives from earlier\ntheological notions: we expect God to have created a beautiful\nuniverse (Smart 1984, p. 121).\n\n3.2 Metaphysical Justifications\n\nOne approach to justifying simplicity principles is to embed such\nprinciples in some more general metaphysical framework. Perhaps the\nclearest historical example of systematic metaphysics of this sort is\nthe work of Leibniz. The leading contemporary example of this\napproach\u2014and in one sense a direct descendent of Leibniz\u2019s\nmethodology\u2014is the possible worlds framework of David Lewis. In\none of his earlier works, Lewis writes,\n\nI subscribe to the general view that qualitative parsimony is good in\na philosophical or empirical hypothesis (Lewis 1973, p. 87).\n\n\nLewis has been attacked for not saying more about what exactly he\ntakes simplicity to be (see Woodward 2003). However, what is clear is\nthat simplicity plays a key role in underpinning his metaphysical\nframework, and is also taken to be a prima facie theoretical\nvirtue.\n\nThough Occam\u2019s Razor has arguably been a longstanding and important\ntool in the rise of analytic metaphysics, it has only been\ncomparatively recently that there has been much debate among\nmetaphysicians concerning the principle itself. Cameron (2010),\nSchaffer (2010), and Sider (2013) each argue for a version of Occam\u2019s\nRazor that focuses specifically on fundamental entities.\nSchaffer (2015, p. 647) dubs this version \"The Laser\" and formulates\nit as an injunction not to multiply fundamental entities beyond\nnecessity, together with the implicit understanding that there is no\nsuch injunction against multiplying derivative entities. Baron and\nTallant (2018) attack \u2018razor-revisers\u2019 such as Schaffer, arguing that\nprinciples such as The Laser fail to mesh with actual patterns of\ntheory-choice in science and are also not vindicated by some of the\nlines of justification for Occam\u2019s Razor.\n3.3 \u2018Intrinsic Value\u2019 Justifications\n\nSome philosophers have approached the issue of justifying simplicity\nprinciples by arguing that simplicity has intrinsic value as a\ntheoretical goal. Sober, for example, writes:\n\nJust as the question \u2018why be rational?\u2019 may have no\nnon-circular answer, the same may be true of the question \u2018why\nshould simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of\nhypotheses?\u2019 (Sober 2001, p. 19).\n\n\nSuch intrinsic value may be \u2018primitive\u2019 in some sense, or\nit may be analyzable as one aspect of some broader value. For those\nwho favor the second approach, a popular candidate for this broader\nvalue is aesthetic. Derkse (1992) is a book-length development of this\nidea, and echoes can be found in Quine\u2019s remarks\u2014in connection\nwith his defense of Occam\u2019s Razor\u2014concerning his taste for\n\u201cclear skies\u201d and \u201cdesert landscapes.\u201d In\ngeneral, forging a connection between aesthetic virtue and simplicity\nprinciples seems better suited to defending methodological rather than\nepistemic principles.\n3.4 Justifications via Principles of Rationality\n\nAnother approach is to try to show how simplicity principles follow\nfrom other better established or better understood principles of\n rationality.[11]\n For example, some philosophers just stipulate that they will take\n\u2018simplicity\u2019 as shorthand for whatever package of\ntheoretical virtues is (or ought to be) characteristic of rational\ninquiry. A more substantive alternative is to link simplicity to some\nparticular theoretical goal, for example unification (see Friedman\n1983). While this approach might work for elegance, it is less clear\nhow it can be maintained for ontological parsimony. Conversely, a line\nof argument which seems better suited to defending parsimony than to\ndefending elegance is to appeal to a principle of epistemological\nconservatism. Parsimony in a theory can be viewed as minimizing the\nnumber of \u2018new\u2019 kinds of entities and mechanisms which are\npostulated. This preference for old mechanisms may in turn be\njustified by a more general epistemological caution, or conservatism,\nwhich is characteristic of rational inquiry.\n\nNote that the above style of approach can be given both a rationalist\nand an empiricist gloss. If unification, or epistemological\nconservatism, are themselves a priori rational principles,\nthen simplicity principles stand to inherit this feature if this\napproach can be carried out successfully. However, philosophers with\nempiricist sympathies may also pursue analysis of this sort, and then\njustify the base principles either inductively from past success or\nnaturalistically from the fact that such principles are in fact used\nin science.\n\nTo summarize, the main problem with a priori justifications\nof simplicity principles is that it can be difficult to distinguish\nbetween an a priori defense and no defense(!).\nSometimes the theoretical virtue of simplicity is invoked as a\nprimitive, self-evident proposition that cannot be further justified\nor elaborated upon. (One example is the beginning of Goodman and\nQuine\u2019s 1947 paper, where they state that their refusal to admit\nabstract objects into their ontology is \u201cbased on a\nphilosophical intuition that cannot be justified by appeal to anything\nmore ultimate.\u201d) (Goodman & Quine 1947, p. 174). It is\nunclear where leverage for persuading skeptics of the validity of such\nprinciples can come from, especially if the grounds provided are not\nthemselves to beg further questions. Misgivings of this sort have led\nto a shift away from justifications rooted in \u2018first\nphilosophy\u2019 towards approaches which engage to a greater degree\nwith the details of actual practice, both scientific and statistical.\nThese other approaches will be discussed in the next two sections.\n",
