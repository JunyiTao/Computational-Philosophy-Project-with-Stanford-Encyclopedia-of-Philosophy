    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nDynamic Epistemic Logic is the study of a family of modal logics, each\nof which is obtained from a given logical language by adding one or\nmore modal operators that describe model-transforming actions. If\n\\([A]\\) is such a modality, then new formulas of the form \\([A]F\\) are\nused to express the statement that F is true after the\noccurrence of action A. To determine whether \\([A]F\\) is true\nat a pointed Kripke model \\((M,w)\\) (see\n Appendix A\n for definitions), we transform the current Kripke model M\naccording to the prescription of action A and we obtain a new\npointed Kripke model \\((M',w')\\) at which we then investigate whether\nF is true. If it is true there, then we say that original\nformula \\([A]F\\) is true in our starting situation \\((M,w)\\). If\nF is not true in the newly produced situation \\((M',w')\\), then\nwe conclude the opposite: \\([A]F\\) is not true in our starting\nsituation \\((M,w)\\). In this way, we obtain the meaning of \\([A]F\\)\nnot by the analysis of what obtains in a single Kripke model but by\nthe analysis of what obtains as a result of a specific\nmodality-specified Kripke model transformation. This is a shift from a\nstatic semantics of truth that takes place in an individual\nKripke model to a dynamic semantics of truth that takes place\nacross modality-specified Kripke model transformations. The advantage\nof the dynamic perspective is that we can analyze the epistemic and\ndoxastic consequences of actions such as public and private\nannouncements without having to \u201chard wire\u201d the results\ninto the model from the start. Furthermore, we may look at the\nconsequences of different sequences of actions simply by changing the\nsequence of action-describing modalities. \n\nIn the following sections, we will look at the many model-changing\nactions that have been studied in Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Many\nnatural applications and questions arise as part of this study, and we\nwill see some of the results obtained in this work. Along the way it\nwill be convenient to consider many variations of the general formal\nsetup described above. Despite these differences, at the core is the\nsame basic idea: new modalities describing certain\napplication-specific model-transforming operations are added to an\nexisting logical language and the study proceeds from there.\nProceeding now ourselves, we begin with what is perhaps the\nquintessential and most basic model-transforming operation: the public\nannouncement. \n",
