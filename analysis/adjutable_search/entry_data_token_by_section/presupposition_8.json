    "main_text": "Local contexts and the dynamic turn || Satisfaction theories\n4.3 Satisfaction theories\n\nAlthough Karttunen\u2019s (1974) model turned out to be equivalent to a\nsystem which, from a purely technical point of view, is in the\nFrege-Strawson tradition, Karttunen (1974) was one of the seminal\npapers of the dynamic zeitgeist that swept through semantics and\npragmatics in the last decades of the twentieth century. Also relevant\nhere are Hamblin (1970), Stalnaker (1972; 1974) , Gazdar (1979) and\nLewis (1979), all of whom advanced dynamic models of pragmatics in\nwhich the (joint) commitments of speakers and hearers evolve as new\nassertions are made and their content becomes part of the linguistic\ncontext available for future utterances. It is against this background\nthat Heim (1982; 1983) offered the first dynamic semantic account of\npresupposition. Heim\u2019s model utilizes Stalnaker\u2019s notion of a context\nas a set of all possible worlds compatible with what has been\nestablished at that point in a conversation, but involves a crucial\ntwist adapted from Karttunen. In Stalnaker\u2019s model, a single\nglobal context is updated each time new information is\nasserted, but in Heim\u2019s model the context is updated locally\nin the process of computing the meanings of subparts of a complex\n expression.[18]\n We can define a simplified version of Heim\u2019s system as follows:\n\nDefinition 11 (Dynamic Semantics)\n\nAssuming that the context set C is a set of possible\nworlds and S and S\u2032 are sentences:\n\n\nC + S = the subset of worlds in C that\nare compatible with S, but this is defined  iff\nS\u2019s presuppositions (if any) are true in all worlds in\nC.\nC + \u00acS = C \u2212 (C +\nS)\nC + S \u2227 S\u2032 = (C +\nS) + S\u2032\nC + S \u25cb S\u2032, where \u25cb\nis some truth functional operator, is given by the simplest classical\ndefinition of \u25cb in terms of \u00ac and \u2227 that preserves the\norder of the two sub-clauses.\nS is satisfied in a context C iff\nC + S = C (i.e., updating C with\nS has no effect).\nS presupposes S\u2032 iff\nS\u2032 is satisfied in all contexts where update with\nS is defined.\n\n\n\nClause (iv) entails that update with a conditional is defined\nvia the equivalence A \u2192 B \u2261 \u00ac\n(A \u2227 \u00ac B) (provided that the subordinate\nclause precedes the main clause). To see how this will work, let\u2019s\nconsider the following example:\n\n(31)\nIf the king is angry, then the knave stole the tarts. ( =\n(16a))\n\nIn order to update a context with (31), we must do the\nequivalent of updating with (32a). Now clause (ii) says that\nto update a context with (32a), we must first try updating with (32b),\nand subtract the result from the original context (so as to leave\nbehind whichever worlds are not compatible with (32a)). But\n(32b) is a conjunction, so we must first update with the left conjunct\n(32c), and then with the right (32d). Updating with (32c) is only\ndefined if the presupposition that there is a king is satisfied in all\nworlds in the context set. We immediately see that (31) and (32a),\n(32b), and (32c) all have this requirement, i.e., they presuppose that\nthere is a king. Provided this presupposition is satisfied, updating\nwith (32c) produces a subset of worlds where the king is angry. We use\nthis reduced context set for update with (32d). But update with (32d)\nagain uses the negation clause (ii) of the above definition.\nSo we started off with a set of worlds where there is a king, we\nreduced it to a set of worlds where the king is angry, and now we must\nupdate that context with (32e), an update which will only be defined\nif there is a knave.\n\n(32a)\nIt\u2019s not the case that [the king is angry and the knave didn\u2019t\nsteal the tarts].\n(32b)\nThe king is angry and the knave didn\u2019t steal the tarts.\n(32c)\nThe king is angry.\n(32d)\nThe knave didn\u2019t steal the tarts.\n(32e)\nThe knave stole the tarts.\n\n\nThe upshot of the above argumentation is that update of a context with\n(31) is only defined for contexts in which (a) there is a king, and\n(b) all the worlds where the king is angry are worlds where there is a\nknave. Following the definitions through, it turns out that, once\nagain, the original sentence carries both a non-conditionalized\npresupposition, that there is a king, and the conditionalized\npresupposition that if the king is angry, then there is a knave.\n\nThe satisfaction based model has seen considerable further\ndevelopment\u2014see e.g., Beaver (1992; 2001), Chierchia (1995),\nHeim (1992), Zeevat (1992), and, for a rather different formalization\nof a dynamic semantic approach, van Eijck (1993; 1994;\n 1995).[19]\n",
