    "main_text": "Fairness\n2. Fairness\n\nFormal methods by themselves do not solve philosophical issues, as the\nfollowing tale from Padma (2007)\nillustrates.\n\n\nTwo farmers, Ram and Shyam were eating chapatis. Ram had 3 pieces of\nthe flat, round bread and Shyam had 5. A traveller who looked hungry\nand tired rode up to the two men. Ram and Shyam decided to share their\nchapatis with him. The 3 men stacked the 8 chapatis (like pancakes)\nand cut the stack into 3 equal parts. They shared the pieces equally\nand ate until nothing was left. The traveller, who was a nobleman, was\nso grateful that he gave the two farmers 8 gold coins for his share of\nthe food.\n\nAfter the traveller left, Ram and Shyam wondered how they should share\nthe 8 gold coins. Ram said that there were 8 coins and only 2 people,\nso each person should get an equal share of 4 coins. \u201cBut\nthat\u2019s not fair,\u201d said Shyam, \u201csince I had 5\nchapatis to begin with.\u201d Ram could see his point, but he\ndidn\u2019t really want to give 5 of the coins to Shyam. So he\nsuggested they go see Maulvi, who was very wise. Shyam agreed.\n\nRam and Shyam told the whole story to Maulvi. After thinking for a\nlong time, he said that the fairest way to share the coins was to give\nShyam 7 coins and Ram only 1 coin. Both men were surprised. But when\nthey asked Maulvi to explain his reasoning, they were satisfied that\nit was a fair division of the 8 coins.\n\n\nHere are reasons the participants could have given to explain each\nmentioned division as being fair:\n\n\n\nRam: \u201cIf the traveller hadn\u2019t arrived, we would have\nshared the chapatis equally. So it is only fair\nif we now share the eight coins equally as well.\u201d\n\n\nShyam: \u201cIf the traveller hadn\u2019t arrived, you would have\nbought one chapati from me at the going rate for chapatis. Now that\nthe traveller was so generous, the going rate suddenly went up to one\ngold coin for a chapati. So your chapatis turned out to be worth three\ngold coins and mine five gold coins.\u201d\n\n\nMaulvi: \u201cThe traveller has eaten one third of eight chapatis.\nRam had only three chapatis to start with, and therefore he has eaten\n\\(1/3\\) chapati from Ram and \\(7/3\\) chapatis from Shyam. So it is\nonly fair if Ram gets one coin and Shyam gets seven.\u201d\n\n\nA moral of this could be that there is no obviously correct notion of\nfairness, in this case, and in many cases. Formal analysis always\nstarts from an intuition and can help to turn that intuition into a\nmore precise definition. Then one can check if a given procedure fits\nthe definition; however, if it fits, that does not show that the\ndefinition is right.\n",
