    "main_text": "Basic Questions\n1. Basic Questions\n\nThe theory of value begins with a subject matter. It is hard to\nspecify in some general way exactly what counts, but it certainly\nincludes what we are talking about when we say any of the following\nsorts of things (compare Ziff [1960]):\n\n\u201cpleasure is good/bad\u201d; \u201cit would be good/bad if you\ndid that\u201d; \u201cit is good/bad for him to talk to her\u201d;\n\u201ctoo much cholesterol is good/bad for your health\u201d;\n\u201cthat is a good/bad knife\u201d; \u201cJack is a good/bad\nthief\u201d; \u201che\u2019s a good/bad man\u201d;\n\u201cit\u2019s good/bad that you came\u201d; \u201cit would be\nbetter/worse if you didn\u2019t\u201d; \u201clettuce is\nbetter/worse for you than Oreos\u201d; \u201cmy new can opener is\nbetter/worse than my old one\u201d; \u201cMack is a better/worse\nthief than Jack\u201d; \u201cit\u2019s better/worse for it to end\nnow, than for us to get caught later\u201d; \u201cbest/worst of all,\nwould be if they won the World Series and kept all of their\nplayers for next year\u201d; \u201ccelery is the best/worst thing\nfor your health\u201d; \u201cMack is the best/worst thief\naround\u201d\n\n\nThe word \u201cvalue\u201d doesn\u2019t appear anywhere on this\nlist; it is full, however, of \u201cgood\u201d,\n\u201cbetter\u201d, and \u201cbest\u201d, and correspondingly of\n\u201cbad\u201d, \u201cworse\u201d, and \u201cworst\u201d. And\nthese words are used in a number of different kinds of constructions,\nof which we may take these four to be the main exemplars:\n\nPleasure is good.\nIt is good that you came.\nIt is good for him to talk to her.\nThat is a good knife.\n\n\nSentences like 1, in which \u201cgood\u201d is predicated of a mass\nterm, constitute a central part of traditional axiology, in which\nphilosophers have wanted to know what things (of which there can be\nmore or less) are good. I\u2019ll stipulatively call them value\nclaims, and use the word \u201cstuff\u201d for the kind of thing of\nwhich they predicate value (like pleasure, knowledge, and money).\nSentences like 2 make claims about what I\u2019ll (again\nstipulatively) call goodness simpliciter; this is the kind of\ngoodness appealed to by traditional utilitarianism. Sentences like 3\nare good for sentences, and when the subject following\n\u201cfor\u201d is a person, we usually take them to be claims about\nwelfare or well-being. And sentences like 4 are what, following Geach\n[1956], I\u2019ll call attributive uses of \u201cgood\u201d,\nbecause \u201cgood\u201d functions as a predicate modifier, rather\nthan as a predicate in its own right.\n\nMany of the basic issues in the theory of value begin with questions\nor assumptions about how these various kinds of claim are related to\none another. Some of these are introduced in the next two sections,\nfocusing in 1.1 on the relationship between our four kinds of\nsentences, and focusing in 1.2 on the relationship between\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d, and between\n\u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d.\n",
