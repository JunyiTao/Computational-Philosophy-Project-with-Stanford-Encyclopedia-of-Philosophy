    "main_text": "\n\nRoger Bacon (1214/1220\u20131292), Master of Arts, contemporary of\nRobert Kilwardby, Peter of Spain, and Albert the Great at the\nUniversity of Paris in the 1240s, was one of the early Masters who\ntaught Aristotle\u2019s works on natural philosophy and metaphysics.\nSometime after 1248\u201349, he became an independent scholar with an\ninterest in languages, mastering the known Greek and Arabic texts on\nthe science of optics. In 1256/57, either at Paris or Oxford, he\njoined the Franciscan Order. By 1262 he believed that his university\nreputation for advanced learning had suffered. And so, he sought the\nPatronage of Cardinal Guy le Gros de Foulque, Papal Ambassador to\nEngland (who later served as Pope Clement IV, 1265\u201368). On the\ninstruction of the Pope on June 22, 1266, Bacon quickly wrote\n\u201can introductory work,\u201d the Opus maius, and the\nrelated works, Opus minus and Opus tertium. He set out\nhis own new model for a reform of the system of philosophical,\nscientific, and theological studies, seeking to incorporate language\nstudies and science studies, then unavailable, at the University of\nParis.\n\nIn this project, he was partly successful. He wrote a new and\nprovocative text on semiotics, and influenced the addition of\nperspectiva to mathematical studies (the Quadrivium) as\na required university subject. He succeeded in setting out a model of\nan experimental science on the basis of his study of optics. The\nlatter was used in his extension of experimental science to include\nnew medicines and the general health care of the body. He did this in\na new context: the application of linguistic and scientific knowledge\nfor a better understanding of Theology and in the service of the\nRes publica Christiana. Bonaventure and John Pecham were among\nhis first readers. It is clear that with the possible exception of the\nuses or astrology and alchemy, Bacon shared in Bonaventure\u2019s\nproject seeking a \u201creduction\u201d of the sciences to theology.\nBacon also found a sympathetic reader and interpreter in the great\nsecular scholar of the Sorbonne, Peter of Limoges (d. 1306). He uses\nBacon\u2019s optics for scientific and moral investigation. Bacon\nthrough the work of Peter of Limoges may have influenced Raymond Lull.\nSometime in the late 1270s or early 1280s, Bacon returned to Oxford,\nwhere he completed his edition with introduction and notes of the\nSecretum secretorum, a Latin translation of an Arabic text on\nthe education of the Prince, the Sirr-al-\u2018asrar. He believed it\nto be a work by Aristotle written for Alexander the Great. This work\nof advice to the Prince points to Bacon\u2019s close connections to\nthe Papal Court through Pope Clement IV, the French Court through\nAlphonse of Poitiers, and the English Court. His contacts with the\nPapal Curia were mediated by William Bonecor, Ambassador for King\nHenry III. Bacon died at Oxford c. 1292.\n",
