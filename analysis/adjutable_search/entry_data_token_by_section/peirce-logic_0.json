    "main_text": "From Monadic to Polyadic Logic\n1. From Monadic to Polyadic Logic\n\nPeirce and Frege, independently of each other, took us from the\ntraditional Aristotelian logic to modern logic\u2014a large leap.\nNobody could deny the power of formalization which has led early\ntwentieth century mathematicians to surprising achievements and\n results.[1]\n What is the essence of the leap made by Peirce and Frege? Is it just\na matter of introducing new formal notations, i.e., quantifiers and\nvariables, so that we may easily formalize our reasoning? If so,\nmodern logic would be just dressing up Aristotelian logic with\nquantifiers/variables. This would equate one of Peirce\u2019s main\ncontributions in logic to the increase in formal vocabulary.\n\nThe enormous impact of the adoption of quantifiers/bound variables on\nthe world of logic and mathematics cannot be denied. However, that\nshould not overshadow Peirce\u2019s insight behind the new extended\nformalism. This section will explore how Peirce\u2019s conviction\nabout the novelty of the logic of relations led him to the\nintroduction of quantifiers/variables. Hence, quantification theory,\naccording to Peirce, is not a matter of a linear extension of formal\nvocabulary, but an expansion into territory that is qualitatively\ndifferent from what Aristotelian logic covers. At the same time, we\nshould not forget that Peirce extended the territory of logic in the\nspirit of Boole\u2019s algebra of logic.\n\nIn \u201cAn Improvement in Boole\u2019s Calculus of Logic\u201d\n(1867) Peirce hints at the need for an improvement of Boolean logic,\nnot in the context of predicate logic, but in its inability to express\nexistential statements in the context of term logic. His 1870 paper\n\u201cDescription of a Notation for the Logic of Relatives, Resulting\nfrom an Amplification of the Conceptions of Boole\u2019s\nCalculus\u201d (DNLR) reveals his ambition to marry Boole\u2019s\nalgebraic notation with De Morgan\u2019s effort at relational\nrepresentation. Many agree that this paper introduces essential\nvocabulary of first-order predicate logic for the first time in\nhistory. Subsequently, in \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic\u201d (1880)\nPeirce investigates two kinds of operations over\nrelations\u2014relative sum and relative product\u2014and \u201cThe\nLogic of Relatives\u201d (known as \u201cNote B\u201d) published in\nhis edited book Studies in Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity (1883) shows a major progress in quantification,\ninfluenced by the work of O. H. Mitchell (who was his student).\nFinally, Peirce\u2019s 1885 paper \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: A\nContribution to the Philosophy of Notations\u201d has been considered\nto be the place where Peirce fully presented his quantification\ntheory.\n\nStarting with DNLR, the first subsection examines Pierce\u2019s\nsubsequent steps until he presented the final form of his first-order\nlogic in his 1885 paper \u201cOn the Algebra of Logic: a Contribution\nto the Philosophy of Notations\u201d. (For a number of manuscripts\nwritten between these two papers, refer to Beatty 1969; Dipert 2004:\n297\u2013299; and Merrill 1978.) The second subsection locates\nPeirce\u2019s first-order predicate logic work in a larger\ncontext.\n",
