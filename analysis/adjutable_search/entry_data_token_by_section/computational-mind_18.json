    "main_text": "Alternative conceptions of computation || Mechanistic theories\n6.4 Mechanistic theories\nThe mechanistic nature of computation is a recurring theme in\nlogic, philosophy, and cognitive science. Gualtiero Piccinini (2007,\n2012, 2015) and Marcin Milkowski (2013) develop this theme into a\nmechanistic theory of computing systems. A functional\nmechanism is a system of interconnected components, where each\ncomponent performs some function within the overall\nsystem. Mechanistic explanation proceeds by decomposing the\nsystem into parts, describing how the parts are organized into the\nlarger system, and isolating the function performed by each part. A\ncomputing system is a functional mechanism of a particular kind. On\nPiccinini\u2019s account, a computing system is a mechanism whose\ncomponents are functionally organized to process vehicles in accord\nwith rules. Echoing Putnam\u2019s discussion of multiple\nrealizability, Piccinini demands that the rules\nbe medium-independent, in that they abstract away from the\nspecific physical implementations of the vehicles. Computational\nexplanation decomposes the system into parts and describes how each\npart helps the system process the relevant vehicles. If the system\nprocesses discretely structured vehicles, then the computation is\ndigital. If the system processes continuous vehicles, then the\ncomputation is analog. Milkowski\u2019s version of the mechanistic\napproach is similar. He differs from Piccinini by pursuing an\n\u201cinformation-processing\u201d gloss, so that computational\nmechanisms operate over information-bearing states. Milkowski and\nPiccinini deploy their respective mechanistic theories to defend\ncomputationalism.\nMechanistic computationalists typically individuate computational\nstates non-semantically. They therefore encounter worries about the\nexplanatory role of representational content, similar to worries\nencountered by FSC and structuralism. In this spirit, Shagrir (2014)\ncomplains that mechanistic computationalism does not accommodate\ncognitive science explanations that are simultaneously computational\nand representational. The perceived force of this criticism will\ndepend upon one\u2019s sympathy for content-involving\ncomputationalism.\n",
