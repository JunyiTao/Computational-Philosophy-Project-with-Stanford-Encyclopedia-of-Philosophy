    "main_text": "The Interpretation of \u201cIntentionality\u201d\n2. The Interpretation of \u201cIntentionality\u201d\n\nThe term \u201cconscious\u201d is not esoteric. But, as we\u2019ve\nseen, its use is not readily characterized in a manner that provides\nsome coherent, impartial framework for disciplined investigation. This\nis part of why theorizing about consciousness is so hard. Where the\nterm \u201cintentionality\u201d is concerned, we also face confusing\nand contentious usage. But here the problem lies partly in the fact\nthat the relevant use is definitely not that found in common\nspeech employing cognate terms (as when we speak of doing something\nintentionally). In any case, here too we must recognize basic problems\nof interpretation that affect substantive issues, highly pertinent to\nthe present discussion.\n\nOne way philosophers have often explained what they mean by\n\u201cintentionality\u201d is this: it is that aspect of mental\nstates or events that consists in their being of or\nabout things, as pertains to the questions, \u201cWhat are\nyou thinking of?\u201d and \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d\nIntentionality is the aboutness or directedness or\nreference of mind (or states of mind) to things, objects,\nstates of affairs, events. So if you are thinking about San Francisco,\nor about the cost of living there, or about your meeting someone at\nUnion Square\u2014your mind, your thinking, is directed toward San\nFrancisco, or the cost of living, or the meeting in Union Square. This\n\u201cdirectedness\u201d conception of intentionality plays a\nprominent role in the philosophy of Franz Brentano and those whose\nviews developed, directly or indirectly, in response to his (to be\ndiscussed in Section 3).\n\nBut what positive features distinguish the relevant\nintentionality-marking senses of these words (\u201cabout\u201d,\n\u201cof\u201d, \u201cdirected\u201d) from those found in:\n\u201cthe cat is wandering about the room\u201d; \u201cshe\nis a person of integrity\u201d; \u201cthe river\u201ds\ncourse was directed towards the fields\u2019? As for talk of\nintentionality as reference, just how are we to distinguish\nthe way thoughts refer from the way names and\ndescriptions do? And how does this notion of intentionality\napply to the senses? When we see or touch something, does our mind\nalso \u201crefer\u201d to what we see or touch, in the same way as\ndoes thought? What unifies the notion of intentionality and governs\nits range of application?\n\nOne way of bringing the senses under the \u201cintentionality\u201d\numbrella, while suggesting what\u2019s special about mental\ndirectedness, focuses on phenomena of perceptual constancy. This plays\nan important role in the conception of intentionality in Edmund\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology. It also figures, in a rather different\nway, in Tyler Burge\u2019s 2010 conception of what it is for the\nsenses to represent objects. We perceive things as constant\nwith respect to some determinable (such as shape, color, or size),\nthrough fluctuation in (a) the subjective experience of them\nwith respect to this determinable, and (b) the corresponding pattern\nof proximal (e.g., retinal) stimulation from them.\nHusserl takes the (a) type constancy-though-flux to show perceptual\nexperience is directed at or refers to objects that go beyond (or\n\u201ctranscend\u201d) it, while Burge takes the (b) sort of\nconstancy to show perceptual states are representations of an\nobjective realm.\n\nHowever, these approaches seem tailored to the senses, and one will\nwonder how to apply \u201cintentionality\u201d univocally to both\nsense perception and thought. One peculiarity that may\nencompass the directedness/aboutness/of-ness/reference of both sense\nexperience and thought (while covering desire and imagination as\nwell): they all may seemingly relate (\u201cpurport to point\u201d)\nto objects that do not exist. Thoughts, unlike roads, can\ndirect you to a city that is not there. One can think about a meeting\nthat has not occurred and never will; one can think of Shangri La, or\nEl Dorado, or the New Jerusalem; one may imagine their shining\nstreets, their total lack of poverty, or their citizens\u2019\npeculiar garb; one may long to live in them. Likewise, when one\nhallucinates, one can experience what is not there to be seen. Maybe\nthis suggests a unifying way to identify the relevant sort of\ndirectedness.\n\nBut this invites new perplexities. Are we to say (with apparent\nincoherence) that there are objects we think of that\ndon\u2019t exist? And what does it mean to say that, when a\nstate of mind is in fact directed toward something that does\nexist, that state nevertheless could be directed toward\nsomething that does not exist? For instance, should we agree\nthat there is some experiential \u201ccommon factor\u201d in\nperception and hallucination? This has been much disputed by\n\u201cdisjunctivist\u201d philosophers of perception, who would\ninsist that perceptual experience, in the non-hallucinatory\n\u201cgood\u201d case, is fundamentally\nrelational. When there is a snake you see, your experience is\na relation between you and that snake, and could not occur at\nall without it\u2014any more than could stepping on it. This\nis not so if you experience a hallucination of a snake, even\nwhen you cannot subjectively discriminate such experience from the\n\u201cgood\u201d kind. If this is right, then it is hard to see how\nwe could get a notion of intentionality to cover both cases, as long\nas this is understood as some kind of reference to what might not\nexist. It can well be fundamental to the nature of mind that its\nstates can be of or about things or \u201cpoint beyond\nthemselves\u201d. But getting a satisfactory grasp of such mental\npointing in all its generality presents theoretical challenges.\n\nA second approach to intentionality may start from the idea that the\npotential reference to the non-existent just discussed is closely\nassociated with the potential for falsehood, error, inaccuracy,\nillusion, hallucination, and dissatisfaction. What makes it possible\nto believe (or even just suppose) something about Shangri La is that\none can falsely believe (or suppose) that something exists. What makes\nit possible to seem to see or hear what is not there is that\none\u2019s experience may in various ways be inaccurate, or\nnonveridical. What makes it possible for one\u2019s desires and\nintentions to be directed toward what does not and never will exist is\nthat one\u2019s desires and intentions can be unfulfilled. And each\nof these negative assessments contrasts with a positive one: truth,\naccuracy, veridicality, and fulfillment. This suggests another general\nstrategy for gaining a theoretical hold on intentionality, employing a\nnotion of satisfaction, stretched to encompass susceptibility\nto each of these forms of assessment. On John Searle\u2019s (1983)\nconception, intentional states are states having \u201cconditions of\nsatisfaction\u201d. For a belief, they are the conditions\nunder which it is true; for sense-experience, they the\nconditions under which it is veridical; for an\nintention the conditions under which it is fulfilled or\ncarried out.\n\nA \u201cconditions of satisfaction\u201d approach to intentionality\nmay seem to furnish an alternative to talk of directedness to objects.\nBut it is not clear that it can get us around its problems. For\ninstance, what are we to say where thoughts are expressed using names\nof nonexistent deities or fictional characters? Will we do away with a\ntroublesome directedness to the nonexistent by saying that the\nthoughts that Zeus is Poseidon\u2019s brother, and that Hamlet is a\nprince, are just false? This is problematic. Moreover, how will we\nstate the conditions of satisfaction of such thoughts? Will this not\nalso involve an apparent reference to the nonexistent? (For\ndiscussion of these issues, see Thomasson 1999 and Crane 2013.) And\nquestions about the proper understanding of the relationship among\nperception, illusion and hallucination remain.\n\nA third important way to conceive of intentionality, one particularly\ncentral to the analytic tradition derived from the study of Frege and\nRussell (see Section 4), is based on the notion of mental (or\nintentional) content. Often it is assumed: to have\nintentionality is to have content. But what is content? Here appeal is\nsometimes made to the idea of representation: a state has\ncontent insofar as it \u201crepresents something to be a certain\nway\u201d, or else \u201ctells\u201d or \u201csays\u201d to one\nsomething about how the world is\u2014where the notion of\nrepresenting and the saying/telling metaphor are assumed to be\nintuitively clear enough to get things started.\n\nAnother way to see what is meant by \u201ccontent\u201d is to think\nof this as what is reported when answering the question, \u201cWhat\ndoes she think?\u201d by something of the form, \u201cShe thinks\nthat p\u201d. And one might regard the content of thought as\nwhat two people share, when what they think is the\nsame (and they think the same thought)\u2014and it\u2019s what\ndiffers when what they think is different. Analogous remarks\napply to belief and intention. (Though it is not quite as clear that\nwhen we speak of what one perceives, this is to be understood\nin just the same way.) Content is also what may vary independently of\nthe \u201cpsychological modes\u201d of states of mind in ways\nillustrated by saying: Believing that I\u2019ll soon be bald\nand fearing that I\u2019ll soon be bald differ in\nmode, but share the content: that I\u2019ll soon be\nbald, while each differ in content from believing and\nfearing that I\u2019ll soon be dead. (One may also wish to\ntreat perception as a \u201cmode\u201d alongside believing,\nfearing, etc.)\n\nDifferences in the content of mental states are also commonly thought\nto be revealed by certain logical features of sentences we use to\nreport them. Reports of thoughts or beliefs and other intentional\nstates (like intention, hope, fear) often do not seem to retain their\ntruth value when co-extensive expressions are substituted in\n\u201cthat-clauses\u201d. For example: \u201cBarack Obama\u201d\nand \u201cthe 44th president of the United States\u201d\nare co-extensive or co-referential. And if it\u2019s true that Barack\nObama was born in Hawai\u2018i, it\u2019s true that the\n44th U.S President was. Even so, Sam can think\nthat Barack Obama was born in Hawai\u2018i without thinking\nthat the 44th U.S President was. It seems plausible that\nthis \u201cfailure of substitutivity\u201d reflects the fact that\njust what Sam might be said to think\u2014the\n\u201ccontents\u201d of his thoughts\u2014differ in such a case.\nOr, as it is sometimes said, intentional states relate to the\nconditions that would satisfy them, or to what they are about, only\n\u201cunder some aspects\u201d and not others\u2014and differences\nin the \u201caspect under which\u201d are differences in\ncontent. (Searle speaks here of the \u201caspectual\nshape\u201d of intentional states.)\n\nThis raises the question of just how a \u201cpossession of\ncontent\u201d conception of intentionality may be coordinated with\nthe conditions of satisfaction conception. It is sometimes assumed\nthat if states of mind contrast in respect of their\nsatisfaction (say, one is true and the other false), they\ndiffer in content. And if one says what the intentional\ncontent of a state of mind is, one says much or perhaps all\nof what conditions must be met if it is to be\nsatisfied\u2014what its conditions of truth, or veridicality, or\nfulfillment, are. But one might also hold that content only determines\nsatisfaction conditions relative to context. This seems especially\nplausible when we consider thoughts expressed with indexicals or\ndemonstratives. (When I think, on multiple occasions, of multiple\nobjects, this is F, what makes what I think true may differ\nwith context, but what I think of each this (and how\nI think of it) on each such occasion may be just the same.) And we may\nallow that states differing \u201caspectually\u201d can in some\nsense have the same conditions of satisfaction. This, and related\nissues, have given rise to diverse interpretations of the notion of\ncontent, and the term has often been alleged to be ambiguous or in\nneed of subtle theoretical refinement. Consider, inter alia:\nEdward Zalta\u2019s 1988 distinction between cognitive and objective\ncontent; Jerry Fodor\u2019s (1991) defense of a distinction between\nnarrow and wide content; John Perry\u2019s (2001) distinction between\nreflexive and subject-matter content); David Chalmers\u2019 (1996,\n2010) two-dimensional conception of content; and Katalin Farkas\u2019\n\u201cuncompromisingly\u201d phenomenal conception of content. See also Walter\nHopp (2011, Chapter 1) for a discussion of the confusing diversity of\n\u201cintentional content\u201d notions in philosophical circulation.\n\nTalk of content clearly has some intuitive basis. We can talk about\nwhat someone thinks (believes, intends, doubts, etc.) and\nregard this \u201cwhat\u201d as remaining the same on multiple\ncases, with multiple subjects: this we may call the content of thought\n(belief, intention, doubt). But once we raise questions about just\nwhat this repeatable \u201cwhat is thought\u201d amounts to, and\nwhat makes it the same or different, \u201ccontent\u201d becomes a\nhighly contentious theoretical term. It can be unclear what\nassumptions lie behind its use by various philosophers, and whether\nthey have the same sort of thing in mind.\n\nEach of the gates of entry into the topic of intentionality identified\nabove\u2014directedness; conditions of satisfaction;\ncontent\u2014arguably opens onto a unitary phenomenon. And some of\nthe connections among them have been hinted at. But there is a fair\namount of fragmentation in the conceptions of intentionality in the\nfield, and the complexities just mentioned cannot be ignored. Perhaps\nthe term \u201cintentionality\u201d only roughly indicates an area\nof inquiry, covering a variety of interestingly (but uncertainly)\ninterrelated phenomena of thought, belief, desire, imagination,\nperception, and symbol use. Here, in any case, we leave much open\nabout how to interpret the notion, in the interests of conducting a\nbroadly inclusive survey that aims to illuminate different ways in\nwhich what \u201cintentionality\u201d is used to pick out has been\nrelated to consciousness. In the interests of such ecumenical breadth,\nit will be useful to conduct an overview of the near history of\nthinking about intentionality, covering important ideas arising both\nin the phenomenological tradition from the late 19th to\nmid-20th century, and in the area of research that in the\nlast half century or so has come to be known as philosophy of\nmind.\n\nIn telling this story, we have to acknowledge (and traverse) the\ndivide in twentieth century western philosophy between so-called\n\u201canalytic\u201d and \u201ccontinental\u201d traditions. This\ndistinction is misleading however, partly because the tendency to\ncategorize phenomenologists en masse as \u201ccontinental\u201d\nwrongly suggests they are all somehow more like all others placed in\nthat class than they are like anyone in the (also wildly\nheterogeneous) group of \u201canalytic philosophers\u201d.\nNevertheless, the history of influence and dialogue linking figures in\nthe phenomenological movement with one another, and that unifying the\nanalytic tradition, yield largely distinct narratives. This, together\nwith the differences in approach, vocabulary, and background\nassumptions, make some disjoint treatment of the two inevitable.\nHowever, it seems fitting to try to encompass both in a single\narticle. For, as will be seen, there are significant thematic\ncommonalities across the two histories, and the differences and\nsimilarities in how these themes are treated in each may be revealing\nand intellectually stimulating.\n",
