    "main_text": "History of Fallacy Theory || Arnauld and Nicole\n2.3 Arnauld and Nicole\n\nAntoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole were the authors of Logic, or\nthe Art of Thinking (1662), commonly known as the Port-Royal\nLogic. According to Benson Mates (1965, 214) it \u201cis an\noutstanding early example of the \u2018how to think straight\u2019\ngenre.\u201d The work includes chapters on sophisms, with the\njustification that \u201cexamples of mistakes to be avoided are often\nmore striking than the examples to be imitated\u201d (Bk. III, xix).\nThe Port-Royal Logic does not continue Aristotle\u2019s distinction\nbetween fallacies that are dependent on language and those that are\nnot; instead there is a division between sophisms associated with\nscientific subjects (ibid.)\u2014these are nearly all from the\nSophistical Refutations\u2014and those committed in everyday\nlife and ordinary discourse (Bk III, xx). The division is not\nexclusive, with some of the sophisms fitting both classes.\n\nThe Port-Royal Logic includes eight of Aristotle\u2019s original\nthirteen fallacies, several of them modified to fit the bent to\nnatural philosophy rather than dialectical argumentation. Several\nkinds of causal errors are considered under the broad heading, non\ncausa pro causa and they are illustrated with reference to\nscientific explanations that have assigned false causes for empirical\nphenomena. Also identified as a common fallacy of the human mind is\npost hoc, ergo propter hoc: \u201cThis happened following a\ncertain thing, hence that thing must be its cause\u201d (Bk. III, xix\n3). Begging the questions is included and illustrated, interestingly,\nwith examples drawn from Aristotelian science. Two new sophisms are\nincluded: one is imperfect enumeration, the error of overlooking an\nalternative, the other is a faulty (incomplete) induction, what we\nmight call hasty generalization. Although the discussions here are\nbrief, they mark the entry of inductive fallacies into the pool of\npresent day recognized fallacies. Ignoratio elenchi retains\nits dialogical setting but is extended beyond the mere failure to\ncontradict a thesis, \u201cto attribut[ing] to our adversaries\nsomething remote from their views to gain an advantage over them, or\nto impute to them consequences we imagine can be drawn from their\ndoctrines, although they disavow and deny them\u201d (Bk. III, xix\n1). The other Aristotelian fallacies included are accident,\ncombination and division, secundum quid and ambiguity.\n\nThe sophisms of everyday life and ordinary discourse are eight in\nnumber and two of them, the sophisms of authority and manner, should\nbe noticed. In these sophisms, external marks of speakers contribute\nto the persuasiveness of their arguments. Although authority is not to\nbe doubted in church doctrines, in matters that God has left to the\ndiscernment of humans we can be led away from the truth by being too\ndeferential. Here we find one of the earliest statements of the modern\nappeal to false authority: people are often persuaded by certain\nqualities that are irrelevant to the truth of the issue being\ndiscussed. Thus there are a number of people who unquestioningly\nbelieve those who are the oldest and most experienced, even in matters\nthat depend neither on age nor experience, but only on mental insight\n(Bk. III, xx 6). To age and experience Arnauld and Nicole add noble\nbirth as an unwarranted source of deference in matters intellectual\n(Bk. III, xx 7), and towards the end of their discussion they add the\nsophism of manner, cautioning that \u201cgrace, fluency, seriousness,\nmoderation and gentleness\u201d is not necessarily a mark of truth\n(Bk. III, xx 8). The authors seem to have the rhetorical flourishes of\nroyal courtiers especially in mind.\n",
