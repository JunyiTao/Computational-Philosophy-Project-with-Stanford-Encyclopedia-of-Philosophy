    "main_text": "Emotion\n7. Emotion\n\nA good deal of aesthetic thinking has been taken up with arguing about\nthe limits to its capacity to appeal to the emotions. Two issues are\nparticularly notable, one descriptive and the other, in part,\nnormative. What, first of all, are the facts about our (apparently)\nemotional responses to fictions? Do we really admire, despise or pity\npeople we know do not exist? This sounds like an empirical question,\nperhaps one to be resolved by studies of the brains of people engaged\nby fictional work. But the prospects for this approach are poor, and\nnot only because of practical difficulties in data gathering (see Cova\n& Teroni 2016). Those who deny that we pity Anna Karenina do no\ndeny that readers may display all the physiological signs that go with\nthat emotion. What they claim is that genuine fear has a cognitive\ncomponent lacking in this case: belief in the object of one\u2019s\nfear. Suppose we could show empirically that readers of Tolstoy do\nexperience all the pity-relevant physiological states while failing to\nbelieve in the existence of Anna Karenina, having instead cognitive\nstates such as \u201cimagining that Anna exists\u201d. The\nphilosophical problem would remain: are people with that psychological\nprofile genuinely in a state of pitying, or is their state merely one\nof what Walton (1978) calls \u201cquasi-pity\u201d, which involves\nthe typical physiological and psychological reactions of pity but\nwhich falls short of being full-fledged pity because it does not go\nwith belief in its objects, or with the typical corresponding\ndispositions to action? We might at this point wonder whether what\nlooked like a substantive question about fear and pity has been shown\nto be merely one about labelling. However, there are empirical\nconsiderations that bear indirectly on the issue. Gendler and\nKovackovick suggest that plausible assumptions about the evolutionary\nproper function of the emotions tells against the idea that fear\nrequires belief. It is likely on Darwinian grounds that our emotions\nwere shaped not merely by their capacity to have us avoid present\ndangers, but also to have us avoid merely possible ones. Imagining a\ndangerous creature lurking in the forest may be enough to send me by a\nsafer route, raising my chances of surviving and passing on my genes.\nIf imagined dangers are part of the reason fear has been selected for\nand retained why insist that responses to the imagined creatures and\nevents of fiction are, as Walton (1978) claims, merely quasi-fears?\nFor other connections between aesthetics and evolutionary thinking see\nbelow,\n Section 9.\n\nA similar problem arises when we consider our responses to music. We\nsometimes talk of sad music making us sad, though the music does not\nprovide us with any reason for thinking that something sad has\nhappened (sad music sometimes reminds us of a sad event, but this is\nnot a general feature of cases where sad music affects us). Here\nappeal to the imagination seems less helpful; unlike fictional\nnarratives, emotionally affecting music does not usually provide us\nwith the materials for imagining some sad event. Kivy has argued that\nsadness on the part of those who listen to sad music is, where it\noccurs, irrelevant to musical appreciation and will indeed not occur\nin episodes of listening which instantiate his preferred model of\nmusical listening, one which requires exclusive attention to the\nstructural, phenomenological, and expressive properties of the music\n(1990: ch. 8). Kivy does not deny however that musical listening can\nand indeed should be a deeply emotional experience; we may be\noverwhelmed by the compositional and performance qualities the work\nrepresents. Some attempt has been made to challenge Kivy on empirical\ngrounds by presenting evidence that music does reliable engender the\nemotions or moods it expresses (Sizer 2007). But Kivy denied this\npossibility only for the case of canonical music listening, and says\nthat there is no reason to think that subjects in the relevant\nexperiments were listening in that canonical way (2007). Certainly it\nwould not be easy to control experimental conditions so as to rule-out\nlistening which is non-canonical in Kivy\u2019s sense (see also Kivy\n2006; Carroll 2003; Carroll & Moore 2007). However, if\nexperimental tests do consistently provide evidence of\nemotion-generation concordant with the emotions expressed by the\nmusic, it will not do simply to say that we have not yet tested the\nright listeners. The friend of Kivy will have to find robust instances\nof the sort of listening he approves of, and not depend merely on the\npersonal testimony of those who favour his theory. We take it, after\nall, that Kivy\u2019s ideal mode of listening is presented as a\npractically achievable goal. Zangwill 2004 represents a formalism that\nis less willing to accommodate the emotions; for a more limited\ndefence of the formalist position see Cochrane 2021b.\n\nAnother aesthetically important question about the emotions is this:\nwhy are we attracted to representations and other devices that\ngenerate negative emotions such as sorrow and fear? It is not a\nsatisfactory answer to this question to make the suggestion referred\nto above that we do not really fear Dracula and other creatures of\nfiction but merely quasi-fear them, because fear and quasi-fear are\nsupposed to be qualitatively the same, so if fear is unpleasant\nquasi-fear is also. The question can be asked about both narrative\nworks and about music; recall that even Kivy grants that\n(non-canonical) musical listening may generate sadness. However,\nfiction has been the greater part of this discussion, and will be here\nalso. On this issue philosophers have tended to take one of three\npositions (but see Smuts 2009 for a wider range of options):\n\nCompensation: audiences tolerate the negative emotions of tragedy,\nhorror and other genres because they recognise compensatory benefits\n(Carroll 1990; Feagin 1983)\nConversion: emotions which would otherwise be experienced as\nunpleasant are experienced as positive in artistic contexts (Hume 1757\n[1987]).\nNeutrality: it is wrong to think that the so called\n\u201cnegative emotions\u201d provoked by tragedy or horror are\nintrinsically unpleasant and hence in need of compensation or\nconversion. They are not intrinsically valenced and may be experienced\nnegatively in some situations and positively in others (Gaut 1993;\nWalton 1990: 255\u20138)\n\n\nNeutrality is a general claim about the emotions and relevant here as\none way to argue in favour of conversion. But a conversion theorists\nneed not be committed to Neutrality. We focus here on the contrast\nbetween Compensation and Conversion. Compensation, unlike Conversion,\nappeals to a type of psychological process that is hardly\ncontroversial; we accept many kinds of unpleasant experiences because\navoiding them will have even less desirable consequences. Conversion\nsounds more problematic: how can an emotion \u201cflip\u201d its\nhedonic value and still be the same emotion? Psychologists interested\nin negative emotions in art have cited research which purports to\nreveal hedonic flip for pain: subjects who expected an intense pain\nbut experienced only a moderately painful stimulus described the\nexperience as \u201cpleasant\u201d, while subjects expecting\nnonpainful warmth described the same stimulus as unpleasant (Leknes et\nal. 2013). This doesn\u2019t by itself show that the same thing can\nhappen in the case of tragedy or horror, but it suggests that the\nconversion claim is less outlandish than it might initially seem.\n\nWhile compensation may appeal to a familiar kind of trade off, it\nneeds to tell us what specific compensatory benefits are to be had\nfrom the negative emotions provoked by art. Philosophers have long\ncited epistemic benefits: the distressing events of tragedy are a\nsource of moral and psychological learning, sometimes about ourselves\n(Collingwood 1938; Schier 1983). Empirical scientists have added to\nthe list: painful emotions generate strong pro-social feelings that\nhelp to unite us with both characters and authors (Bastian, Pe, &\nKuppens 2017; Egloff 2017).\n\nWhile philosophers have long offered theories to resolve this\n\u201cparadox of tragedy,\u201d only one substantial study of it\nclaims to be grounded in empirical research. Menninghaus and\ncolleagues propose what they call the \u201cthe Distancing-Embracing\nmodel\u201d (Menninghaus, Wagner, Hanich, et al. 2017) according to\nwhich an aesthetic context, as with watching a play or film, distances\nus from the situation represented and allows the positive effects of\ntragic emotions, notably their capacity to focus attention, to sustain\nthem. While a large and relevant body of empirical work is called on\nin support of the idea, its theoretical commitments are unclear. In\nsome of their formulations the function of distancing seems to be the\nreduction in unpleasantness of negative emotions to the point where\nthey are \u201cnot inevitably incompatible with art-specific\nexpectations of hedonic reward\u201d (2017: 6); this leaves them open\nto the charge made against compensation theories that the work\u2019s\nbeing apt to generate negative emotions seems to be a major factor in\nattracting people to the work, rather than something negative we can\nbe persuaded to live with. In other formulations they speak of the\nfactors \u201cinvolved in making negative emotions enjoyable\u201d\n(2017: 3), which suggests the conversion theory. Yet they claim that\ntheir theory is a version of neither of these approaches (2017: 15;\nsee S. Davies 1997). (For more on the relationship between fiction and\nemotion see the supplement to Liao & Gendler 2018 [2020]). See\nbelow,\n Section 7\n for further remarks on fiction and emotion.\n\nTo conclude the discussion of fiction, we note another direct appeal\nto work at the empirical level. Derek Matravers (2014) argues that it\nhas been a mistake of recent theorising about fiction to appeal to the\nimagination. Matravers claims that work on mental models does a good\njob of explaining our processing and comprehension of, and responses\nto, both fictional and nonfictional narratives without any need to\ndistinguish fictional cases by their connection with the\nimagination.\n",
