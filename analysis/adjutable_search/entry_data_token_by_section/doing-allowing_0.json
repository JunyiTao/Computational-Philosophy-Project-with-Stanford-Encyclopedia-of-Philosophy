    "main_text": "The Contrast Strategy and Analysis-Independent Justifications\n1. The Contrast Strategy and Analysis-Independent Justifications\n\nJames Rachels (1975) provides a classic example of the contrast\n strategy.[3]\n He offers us a pair of cases\u2014in one, Smith drowns his young\ncousin in the bathtub; in the other, Jones plans to drown his young\ncousin, but finds the boy already unconscious under water and refrains\nfrom saving him. The two cases are designed to be exactly alike except\nthat the first is a killing and the second a letting die. Rachels\ninvites us to agree that Smith\u2019s behavior is no worse than\nJones\u2019s. He then concludes that killing per se is no worse than\nletting die per se, and that if typical killings are worse than\ntypical lettings die that must be because of other factors. \n\nRachels\u2019 argument depends on two claims: (1) the two cases are\nexactly alike except that one is a killing and the other a letting\ndie; (2) that there is no moral difference between the cases. Both\nthese claims have been challenged.\n\nScott Hills (2018) challenges (1). He argues that the cases are not\nproperly equalised because Jones has the ability to either kill his\ncousin or to let him die, while Smith does not have the option to\nmerely let his cousin die. Hills adds a third case in which the agent\nfinds his cousin drowning and chooses to kill him rather than let him\ndie. Hills argues that this behaviour is worse than both Jones\u2019\nletting die and Smith\u2019s killing while lacking the option to let\ndie. Hills argues that the best explanation for our intuitions about\nthis third case is that killing is worse than letting die.\n\nAlthough most people struggle to see a moral difference between\nSmith\u2019s behavior and Jones\u2019 behavior, Frances Kamm (2007)\nargues that the cases might not be intuitively morally equivalent. She\nsuggests that we test the apparent moral equivalence by asking whether\nwe could imposes the same losses on Jones and Smith, assuming these\nwere necessary to bring the child back to life. Kamm claims that it\nwould be permissible to kill Smith to bring the child back to life but\nimpermissible to kill Jones for this reason (Kamm 2007, 17). If Kamm\nis right, then there is an intuitive difference between the two\n cases.[4]\n\n\nEven if Rachels were correct that Smith\u2019s and Jones\u2019s\nbehavior is morally equivalent, we may not be able to infer the moral\nequivalence of killing and letting die in general (where other things\nare equal) from this. Shelly Kagan argues that this inference assumes\nthat \u201cif a factor has genuine moral relevance, then for any pair\nof cases, where the given factor varies while others are held\nconstant, the cases in that pair will differ in moral status\u201d\n(Kagan 1988). He claims, moreover, that this assumes the Additive\nAssumption, the view that \u201cthe status of the act is the net\nbalance or sum which is the result of adding up the separate positive\nand negative effects of the individual factors\u201d (Kagan 1988,\n259). He raises several objections to the Additive Assumption.\nFirstly, one might describe a pair of cases that are exactly alike\nexcept that one is a killing and the other a letting die, where the\nfirst intuitively seems far worse than the second. If this pair of\ncases is as good as Rachels\u2019 pair, then either the inference is\nvalid in both cases\u2014to prove the contradiction that killing is\nboth worse and not worse than letting die\u2014or it is invalid in\nboth cases. Secondly, one might raise the rhetorical question: why\naddition\u2014rather than, say, multiplication or some other\nfunction? Similarly, Kamm (1996, 2007) defends a Principle of\nContextual Interaction according to which a property can behave\ndifferently in one context than\n another.[5]\n\n\nQuinn (1989) argues that would-be counterexamples like the Bathtub\ncase involve a misunderstanding of the claim that the distinction\nbetween doing and allowing harm is morally significant. This claim\nshould be understood as more about moral justification than about\nother forms of moral evaluation. Quinn thinks that the distinction\nbetween doing and allowing is morally significant not because there is\nsome kind of intrinsic disvalue attached to doing harm, but because\ndoing and allowing harm run up against different kinds of rights. On\nQuinn\u2019s view, the right against doing harm is stronger in that\nit takes much more to defeat or over-ride it. Thus much stronger\nconsiderations are needed to justify doing harm than to justify merely\nallowing harm (other things being equal). Suppose doing harm is much\nharder to justify than merely allowing harm (other things being\nequal). An unjustified killing and an unjustified letting die may\nstill be equally bad. Quinn illustrates this with an example: You have\na right of privacy that the police not enter your home without your\npermission. This right is easier to defeat than your right that other\nordinary citizens not enter your home without permission. Nonetheless,\nunjustified break-ins by the police are, if anything, morally worse\nthan unjustified break-ins by ordinary citizens. Quinn claims that\nthis is because \u201cmoral blame for the violation of a right\ndepends very much more on motive and expected harm than on the degree\nto which the right is defeasible\u201d (Quinn 1989, 290) \n\nSamuel Scheffler (2004) also attempts to settle the moral significance\nof the distinction between doing and allowing without offering an\naccount of the distinction. He argues that: \u201cdespite the lack of\nconsensus about which candidate is to be preferred, our practice of\ntreating one another as responsible agents requires us to make some\ndistinction of this kind\u201d (Scheffler 2004, 216).\nScheffler\u2019s paper is rich and correspondingly difficult to\ninterpret. However, the main argument seems to consist of two parts.\nIn the first part, Scheffler argues that to hold oneself and others to\nmoral requirements, one must already (a) draw a distinction between\nwhat one does and what one merely allows (or some other similar\ndistinction) and (b) treat this distinction as morally important. To\nhold oneself to moral requirements involves seeing oneself as having\nreason to act in one way rather than another. One must therefore see\noneself as an agent who is charged with the task of regulating\none\u2019s conduct in accordance with reasons. However, regulating\none\u2019s behavior is something one does, not something one merely\nallows to happen. Thus to hold oneself to a moral requirement is to\nattach a special importance to, and accept special responsibility for,\nwhat one does (Scheffler 2004, 220\u2013227). In the second part,\nScheffler argues that this distinction in moral significance needs to\nbe included in the moral requirements themselves: i.e. the set of\nrequirements we hold each other to must draw a distinction between\nwhat the agent does and what she merely allows. Scheffler argues that\nholding oneself to a set of moral requirements which require one to\nmake optimal use of our causal opportunities is unstable. Such a set\nof moral requirements would require a purely instrumental view of the\nagency of oneself and others: we assess conduct purely in terms of\nwhether it produces the optimal available outcome. However, holding\noneself and others to moral requirements involves adopting a\nnon-instrumental view of agency: (1) The reasons one has to regulate\none\u2019s conduct must be non-instrumental; (2) Holding oneself and\nothers to moral requirements involves seeing failure to live up to\nsuch requirements as meriting responses such as blame. Because whether\nblame is merited is not settled by whether it would produce the best\noutcome, this requires us to recognise non-instrumental reasons\n(Scheffler 2004,\n 227\u2013236).[6]\n\nOthers have taken an account of the nature of the doing/allowing\ndistinction to be a necessary starting point for assessing its moral\nrelevance. On this view, we cannot assess whether the difference\nbetween doing and allowing is morally significant until we know what\nthat distinction is. Before discussing some prominent approaches to\nthe analysis of the doing/allowing distinction and related assessments\nof its moral relevance, we will clear the way by identifying some\nrelated distinctions that are sometimes confused with the\ndoing/allowing distinction.\n",
