    "main_text": "What is Moral Status? || The Concept of Moral Status\n2.1 The Concept of Moral Status\n\n\u201cMoral status\u201d is not part of the shared vocabulary of all\nethical theories. An act utilitarian, for example, has no more use for\nthat concept than for \u201crespect,\u201d \u201crights,\u201d or\n\u201cinviolability.\u201d For a theory that accorded weight to\nbeings only in proportion to the utility they enjoyed or produced, the\nconcept of moral status would be relevant only in the indirect sense\nthat its use would affect aggregate utility in various ways. For\nexample, the negative utility that might result from denying some\nhuman beings full moral status might support a policy of treating all\nhuman beings as if they had full moral status (see\n Sec. 4).\n On such a theory, the most salient moral property of an individual is\nher capacity to occupy states that can be characterized as\n\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad,\u201d the most obvious being\npleasure and pain. The possession of such a capacity gives an\nindividual a morally considerable interest in occupying or avoiding\nsuch states. Moral considerability is: 1) continuous, in that the\ndegree of moral considerability that a being possesses varies in\nproportion to the strength, character, and number of its interests;\nand 2) asymmetrical, in the sense that a being might have moral claims\non others without others having moral claims on it.\n\nWhen non-utilitarian philosophers discuss \u201cmoral status\u201d\nof a type of being, they are generally using a more categorical notion\nthan moral considerability. They generally understand moral status as\na threshold concept and a range concept. Beings that fall below a\nminimum level\u2014the threshold\u2014of a status-conferring\nattribute like rationality lack a certain kind of moral status despite\npossessing the attribute to some degree. And all beings that fall\nwithin the \u201crange\u201d\u2014that reach the threshold level of\nthe attribute\u2014have the same moral status regardless of how far\nthey exceed that threshold. (The term \u201crange concept\u201d\ncomes from Rawls; his example is of points within a circle, all of\nwhich are equally \u201cinside\u201d despite varying distances from\nthe circumference.) More controversially, moral status is sometimes\nregarded as symmetrical: a being must be able to have moral claims\nmade on it (and hence be capable of responsibility) as well as being\nable to make moral claims on others. A symmetry condition would\nexclude any human being lacking the capacity to have moral claims made\non them\u2014not only individuals with radical cognitive impairments,\nbut infants and young children as well.\n\nNot all writers on moral status treat it as both a threshold and range\nconcept. Both features of the concept have been challenged, and the\nconcept itself has been criticized as hierarchical and elitist (Birch\n1993). Several philosophers have argued for treating moral status as a\nmatter of degree, so that a being\u2019s moral status varies\nproportionately with its morally-relevant attributes (Perring 1997;\nDeGrazia 2008). These proposals avoid uncomfortably sharp dichotomies,\nbut they have a revisionary character. Even if commonsense morality\nrecognizes some gradations in moral status, well-established social\npractices such as animal research assume discontinuities. Moreover,\neven if common sense could be reconciled to gradations below the\nthreshold (which would thereby become less of a threshold), it would\nbalk at recognizing gradations above it, thereby abandoning moral\nstatus as a range concept.\n\nMore comprehensively, Mary Ann Warren has proposed a multi-criterial\naccount of moral status, in which it is neither a range nor a\nthreshold concept. For Warren, the moral status of a being varies with\nthe degree that it possesses the status-conferring attribute (Warren\n 1997).[3]\n But Warren maintains that \u201cfull moral status\u201d is both a\nthreshold and a range concept; beings with moral agency enjoy the\nsame, highest moral status regardless of the degree to which they\npossess the attributes needed for moral agency. As noted earlier, we\nwill use the term \u201cfull moral status\u201d to refer to the\nmoral status that is generally accorded to cognitively nondisabled\nhuman adults, without assuming that there can be no higher status.\n\u201cFull moral status\u201d is thus roughly synonymous with\n\u201cpersonhood\u201d as that term is used in debates about whether\nfetuses, or higher primates, are persons.\n\nThe issue of moral status, and which beings have full moral status,\nhas become important because of its bearing on the rights and\ntreatment of those beings. \u201cMoral status\u201d and \u201cfull\nmoral status\u201d are not intended as honorifics; their ascription\nto a being entails that it enjoys rights that other beings, lacking\nthat status, do not. The particular rights entailed by full moral\nstatus may, however, differ on different moral theories. Two theories\nwith the same concept of moral status and the same criteria for\nassigning it (see\n Sec. 2.2)\n may associate full moral status with different rights or rights of\ndifferent strength. One theory might, for example, hold that beings\nwith full moral status may never be used as mere means, whereas\nanother might hold that they may be so used in certain emergencies.\nThere is, though, only partial independence between the formal\ncharacter of and criteria for moral status, on the one hand, and the\nrights entailed by such status, on the other. For example, it would\nseem implausible for a theory to recognize a categorical notion of\nmoral status while rejecting any notion of rights. An account of moral\nstatus need not deny all rights to beings falling below the threshold\nit sets; they will merely lack the same package of rights possessed by\nbeings above that threshold.\n\nTwo philosophers (Sachs, 2011; Silvers, 2011) have questioned the\nutility of the concept of \u201cmoral status.\u201d Sachs argues\nthat claims about moral status are unnecessary and confusing, because\nthe debate is really about the specific attributes needed to justify\nor ground specific rights. Silvers offers an even harsher critique.\nShe charges that proponents of both psychologically and biologically\nbased criteria (see\n Sec. 4,\n Sec. 5, below) neglect gradations in relevant characteristics\nand overlook the potential to display or develop those\ncharacteristics, resulting in unwarranted exclusion. As an\nalternative, Silvers proposes an account of justice that, avoiding\nprior assumptions about capacity, seeks to include as many beings as\npossible within a scheme of social cooperation.\n\nAlthough moral status claims may well obscure more often than they\nenlighten, they do not, however, merely concern the grounding of\nspecific rights in specific attributes. First, as noted above,\ntheories that share the same criteria for full moral status may differ\nin the rights they associate with that status, and vice-versa.\nMoreover, even if Silvers is correct about the exclusionary tendencies\nof moral status notions, the prior question remains of whether their\nthreshold and range features can be justified. How can the small\ndifferences in morally-relevant attributes that place a being above or\nbelow the threshold ground large differences in the package of rights\nand immunities that being possesses? How can all cognitively normal\nhumans have the same package of rights and immunities despite\ndiffering greatly in the attributes that place them above the\nthreshold? Those who defend the standard concept of moral status need\na moral theory to underwrite its range and threshold features; those\nwho attack it need to deny that any plausible theory could do so.\n",
