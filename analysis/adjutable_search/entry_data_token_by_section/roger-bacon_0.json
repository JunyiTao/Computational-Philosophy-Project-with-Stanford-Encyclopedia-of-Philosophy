    "main_text": "Modern Research on Roger Bacon\n1. Modern Research on Roger Bacon\n\nThere are two modern approaches to Bacon. The first is the study of\nthe physical, metaphysical, and related works of Bacon. Discovered in\n1848 by Victor Cousin in Amiens MS 406, these works were edited by\nRobert Steele and Ferdinand Delorme [OHI, 1905\u20131940]. With the\nexception, however, of some new work on the teaching on the soul,\nBacon\u2019s concept of matter, the doctrine of\nexperientia/experimentum, and the doctrines of universals and\nindividuation, the doctrine of the heavens, and alchemy, the content\nof these works has remained largely unstudied until the present time.\nIndeed, one can argue that \u201ccritical\u201d scholarly study of\nthese works has only just begun. In 2013, Silvia Donati made a\ncritical study of Amiens MS 406. She has presented solid arguments for\nexcluding three of the eight philosophical commentaries from the canon\nof Bacon\u2019s works. They are the Questions on the Physics\nI-IV, Questions on Metaphysics XI, and Questions on\nMetaphysics I-IV. These three texts were commonly used in all\nprevious scholarship. And so, great care must now be taken in reading\nthe traditional scholarship on early Bacon where these works have\noften been referenced.\n\nThe second and better known interpretation of Roger Bacon as a\nscientist is found in nineteenth and twentieth century writers on the\nhistory of science and has a solid basis in Bacon\u2019s own work,\ne.g., the edition of the Opus tertium by J.S. Brewer [OQHI].\nBacon\u2019s Perspectiva (1267) [PRSP, 1996] presents a model\nfor an experimental science that ushered in a new addition to the\ntraditional Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music)\nin the new universities of the Latin West, namely, the study of\noptics. The university teaching text, \u201cThe Common Teaching on\nPerspectiva,\u201d was written by Bacon\u2019s Parisian\ncolleague,John Pecham. We have critical editions now for the major\nscientific works of Bacon. SISMEL at Florence, Italy now houses a\nRoger Bacon research center. It has plans for future critical\neditions. A new international society for the study of Roger Bacon,\nThe Roger Bacon Research Society has recently been\nestablished. \n\nIn 1859, William Whewell set the tone for this modern account of\n\u201cRoger Bacon and the Sciences\u201d (Whewell 1858, p. 245). He\nviewed Bacon as an advocate of experimentation ahead of his time. In\nthe late nineteenth century, Robert Adamson and many others\ninterpreted Bacon as a philosopher of science in the modern sense of\nthe term. This understanding of Roger Bacon did not begin in the\nnineteenth century. Already in the late Renaissance, Francis Bacon had\ncharacterized Roger Bacon as an exceptional figure among the\n schoolmen.[1]\n Francis held that Roger Bacon had set aside the scholastic\ndisputations of his age and engaged in the mechanical understanding of\nthe secrets of nature.\n\nIn the 1900s, Thorndike [LT1;LT2] and Duhem [LSDM, III, 442] asserted\nthat the role of observation in Bacon\u2019s science was minimal and\nadded nothing to his idea of a science. This modern read-back of\nmodern experimental method ignored the importance of optics in\nBacon\u2019s model for a science (Lindberg, 1997). In recent studies\n(2006, 2012), Jeremiah Hackett has made explicit the manner in which\nRoger Bacon served as a foil for Martin Heidegger\u2019s discussions\non the originality of modern science as a sign of Modernity. For\nHeidegger, Bacon did not achieve the post-Galilean and Post-Cartesian\ndiscovery of a mathematical projection of nature and the consequent\nmodern experiment. He claimed that it was false to argue, as many had\ndone between 1880 and 1940, that Roger Bacon was the source for the\npost-Cartesian concept of science. One can argue for the uniqueness of\nmodern scientific method without setting aside the longue duree that\nled to Kepler. One might note in passing that for Heidegger, Kepler is\nthe true forefather of modern science. In the post-World War II years,\nA.C. Crombie (1953) argued that the \u201cqualitative\u201d aspects\nof modern science originated at Oxford in the early thirteenth\ncentury, specifically in the work of Grosseteste and Roger Bacon. This\ninterpretation received a critical response from Alexander\nKoyr\u00e9 (1957) and others. Despite their significantly different\nphilosophical committments, Heidegger and Koyr\u00e9 both shared\nHusserl\u2019s views on the distinctiveness of the modern\nmathematical projection of nature as a condition for controlled\nexperimentation. This was seen as a distinctive new phenomenon, a\nmarker of modernity and something quite distinct from ancient and\nmedieval science. It was argued that Crombie read back some aspects of\nmodern scientific method into the works of Grosseteste and Bacon.\nHowever, a recent study by Mattia Mantovani has signaled clear\nconnections between Bacon and Descartes\u2019 approach to vision and\nperception (Mantovani 2020). \n\nThomas S. Kuhn (1976), however, maintained that Crombie did identify a\nreal methodological connection between medieval and early modern\nscience. More recently, M. Schramm (1998) has argued that Bacon plays\na significant role in framing the context for the beginnings of\nmedieval, Renaissance and early modern notions of laws of nature. This\ndiscusion has now been taken up for research by Giora Hon and Yael\nRaizman-Kedar. The studies and editorial work of David C. Lindberg on\nBacon\u2019s natural philosophy, for example, the De\nmultiplicatione specierum [DMS] and Perspectiva [PRSP]\n(1983\u20131996) have emphasized the need to read Roger Bacon as a\nmedieval scientist and not as an early modern or modern scientist.\nThus, it is as a medieval philosopher, scientist, and theologian that\nhe must be properly understood. Despite the polarity generated by two\nseparate modern traditions of interpretation, it should be noted that\nthere is some continuity between the interests of Bacon the\nAristotelian commentator and Bacon the writer on science.\n",
