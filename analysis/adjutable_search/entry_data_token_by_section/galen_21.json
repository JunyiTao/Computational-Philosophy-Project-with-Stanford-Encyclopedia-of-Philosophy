    "main_text": "Ethics || The path\u0113\n8.2 The path\u0113\nA standard point of school conflict in the ethical discourse of Galen\u2019s time was that between the Stoic insistence on the need for total eradication of the affections (related to the doctrinal position that any giving-in to pathos is in fact a form of madness) and the Platonic-Aristotelian advocacy of a \u201cmoderate level of affectedness\u201d (metriopatheia). It is perhaps significant that this technical term, employed by Galen\u2019s \u201cMiddle Platonist\u201d contemporaries, does not appear in his own extant ethics; and indeed, much of the discourse of both Aff. Pecc. Dig. and Ind. seems consistent with the aim of eradication of the path\u0113. On the other hand, Galen comes down against the necessity of total eradication, especially in Ind.; here, explicitly engaging with this ethical question, Galen denies that he could be happy inside the Bull of Phalaris (a notorious instrument of torture as well as a stock Epicurean philosophical example), and takes issue with the Stoic Musonius for his reported welcoming of adversity.\nOn the one hand, Galen imposes very high standards in this area, claiming himself to have been \u201ccompletely undistressed\u201d by the fire in which he lost a huge number of valuables, including a major part of his own writings; in another sense, he manifests a realistic and down-to-earth approach, asserting that freedom from distress is possible so long as certain basic human needs are met. He acknowledges that certain circumstances might deprive him of his moral equilibrium\u2014exile, for example, or injustice visited upon a friend\u2014and hopes not to encounter those.\nThere is a broader point about pathos: in Aristotle the term is ethically neutral, referring to emotive or non-rational experience quite generally; thus, in the Nicomachean Ethics, virtues may be understood as involving a mean, between an excessive and an inadequate emotive response. Both the Aristotelian picture and the term metriopatheia entail an understanding of pathos as not in itself negative; Galen\u2019s understanding of pathos, in the ethical context, seems rather in accord with the Stoic conception: it is in its nature undesirable, to be reduced or eliminated as far as possible\u2014even if he does not follow the Stoics in asserting the necessity, or indeed practicability, of its complete eradication.\nAgainst this, however, it should be observed that Galen adopts an Aristotelian-type mean theory in relation to physical excellence; that he suggests, e.g., in QAM, that physical states of good balance will accord with good ethical states, and that in at least one passage, in Temp. he invokes something like an Aristotelian mean theory in talking of this correspondence between physical and ethical good balance: the soul of the well-balanced man will \u201cbe at an exact balance between boldness and cowardice, hesitation and rashness, pity and envy\u201d (Temp. II.1, 233).\n",
