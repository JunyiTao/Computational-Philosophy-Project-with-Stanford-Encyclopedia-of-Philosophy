    "main_text": "What is Harm?\n5. What is Harm?\n\nProponents of the harm principle often proceed without supplying any\ndefinition or understanding of \u201charm\u201d. Mill himself gives\nno explicit general definition of what he means by the word,\nsatisfying himself with various examples, contextual stipulations and\nhints:\n\n\nhe seems throughout to think no further explanation is necessary, and\nto count on any literate speaker of English to accept his application\nof the word or of some proxy for it. (Brown 2017: 411)\n\n\nAs we will see, other writers consider they can detect in Mill one or\nmore ways to define or understand the term. Perhaps, as well as\nrelying on general linguistic intuitions, one can simply cite paradigm\ncases. These come easily to mind; harm as \u201cbroken bones and\nstolen purses\u201d as Joel Feinberg puts it (Feinberg 1984: 214).\nCertainly, one harms others, on any folk understanding of the term, by\nkilling, raping, beating, defrauding, or stealing. But the ordinary\nsense of harm may also suggest that a transitory pain is a harm and\nmay also have rather porous borders with other normative concepts such\nas \u201cwrong\u201d, May there, then, be trouble ahead developing a\nsufficiently determinate, discriminating, and workable conception of\nharm for purposes of applying the harm principle?\n",
