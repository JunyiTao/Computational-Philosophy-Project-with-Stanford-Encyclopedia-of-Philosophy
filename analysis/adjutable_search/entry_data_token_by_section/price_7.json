This Na\u00efve Realism has two sides: First, perceptual\nconsciousness, in Price\u2019s sense, is equivalent to knowledge that\nthere is a material object to which the current sense-datum belongs.\nSecond, for a sense-datum (which is visual or tactual) to belong to an\nobject is for it to be part of the surface of the object. (The\ncentrality in this debate of the notion of a surface comes from\nMoore\u2019s discussion, e.g., 1942: 649\u2013659.)\n\nPrice proposes two versions of what he calls the Argument from\nIllusion (1932: 27): one Phenomenological and the other, Causal. The\nfirst is Price\u2019s version of the traditional argument, based on\nits familiar examples of illusion. The second is an argument aiming to\nshow that visual and tactual sense-data exist only if there are\nprocesses occurring in the subject (say, neural processes), which\nmeans that, since the surfaces themselves (and the objects to which\nthey belong) exist, whatever is going on in the subject, they cannot\nbe the same thing as the sense-datum. He proposes that the causal\nargument is unpersuasive, but the phenomenological one works. (For\nfurther discussion: 1956; also Hamlyn 1970: 147ff; Crane 2005:\n\u00a71.2.)\n",
