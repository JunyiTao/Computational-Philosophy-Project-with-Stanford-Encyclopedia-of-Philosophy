    "main_text": "\n\nThe notion of transworld identity\u2014\u2018identity across\npossible worlds\u2019\u2014is the notion that the same object exists\nin more than one possible world (with the actual world treated as one\nof the possible worlds). It therefore has its home in a\n\u2018possible-worlds\u2019 framework for analysing, or at least\nparaphrasing, statements about what is possible or necessary.\n\nThe subject of transworld identity has been highly contentious, even\namong philosophers who accept the legitimacy of talk of possible\nworlds. Opinions range from the view that the notion of an identity\nthat holds between objects in distinct possible worlds is so\nproblematic as to be unacceptable, to the view that the notion is\nutterly innocuous, and no more problematic than the uncontroversial\nclaim that individuals could have existed with somewhat different\nproperties. Matters are complicated by the fact that an important\nrival to \u2018transworld identity\u2019 has been proposed: David\nLewis\u2019s counterpart theory, which replaces the claim that an\nindividual exists in more than one possible world with the claim that\nalthough each individual exists in one world only, it has counterparts\nin other worlds, where the counterpart relation (based on similarity)\ndoes not have the logic of identity. Thus much discussion in this area\nhas concerned the comparative merits of the transworld identity and\ncounterpart-theoretic accounts as interpretations, within a\npossible-worlds framework, of statements of what is possible and\nnecessary for particular individuals. (Similar issues arise concerning\nthe\n transworld identity of properties.)\n",
