    "main_text": "Kurt G\u00f6del\n11. Conclusions\n\nLet us now try to draw some lessons, and in particular ask whether the\nemergence of first-order logic was inevitable. I begin with an\nobservation. Each stage of this complex history is conditioned by two\nsorts of shifting background consideration. One is broadly\nmathematical: the theorems that had been established. The other is\nbroadly philosophical: the assumptions that were made (explicitly or\ntacitly) about logic and about the foundations of mathematics. These\ntwo things interacted. Each thinker in the sequence starts with some\nmore or less intuitive ideas about logic. Those ideas prompt\nmathematical questions: distinctions are drawn: theorems are proved:\nconsequences are noted, and the philosophical understanding is\nsharpened. At each stage, the question, \u201cWhat is logic?\u201d\n(or: \u201cWhat is the correct logic?\u201d) needs to be\nassessed against both the mathematical and the philosophical\nbackground: it makes little sense to ask the question in the\nabstract.\n\nLet us now consider the question: When was first-order logic\ndiscovered? That question is too general. It needs to be broken\ndown into three subsidiary questions:\n\n\\((\\alpha)\\) When\nwas first-order logic first explicitly identified as a distinct\nlogical system? This question has a relatively straightforward\nanswer. First-order logic was explicitly identified by Peirce in 1885,\nbut then forgotten. It was independently re-discovered in\nHilbert\u2019s 1917/18 lectures, and given wide currency in the 1928\nmonograph, Hilbert & Ackermann. Peirce was the first to identify\nit: but it was Hilbert who put the system on the map.\n\\((\\beta)\\) When\nwas first-order logic recognized as being importantly different from\nhigher-order systems? This is a more complicated question.\nAlthough Hilbert isolated first-order logic, he did not treat it as\nespecially significant, and he himself continued to work in type\ntheory. An awareness of the fundamental metalogical differences\nbetween first-order and higher-order logic only began to emerge in the\nearly 1930s, mostly, though not exclusively, at the hands of\nG\u00f6del.\n\\((\\gamma)\\) How\ndid first-order logic come to be regarded as a privileged logical\nsystem\u2014that is, as (in some sense) the \u201ccorrect\u201d\nlogic for investigations in foundations of mathematics? That\nquestion, too, is highly complicated. Even after the G\u00f6del\nresults were widely understood, logicians continued to work in type\ntheory, and it took years before first-order logic attained canonical\nstatus. The transition was gradual, and cannot be given a specific\ndate.\n\n\nEquipped with these distinctions, let us now ask: Why was\nfirst-order logic not discovered earlier?\n\nIt is striking that Peirce, already in 1885, had clearly\ndifferentiated between propositional logic, first-order logic, and\nsecond-order logic. He was aware that propositional logic is\nsignificantly weaker than quantificational logic, and, in particular,\nis inadequate to an analysis of the foundations of arithmetic. He\ncould then have gone on to observe that second-order logic is in\ncertain respects philosophically problematic, and that, in general,\nour grasp on quantification over objects is firmer than our\ngrasp on quantification over properties. The problem arises\neven if the universe of discourse is finite. We have, for example, a\nreasonable grasp on what it means to speak (in first-order terms) of\nall the planets, or to say that there exists a\nplanet with a particular property. But what does it mean to talk\n(in second-order terms) of all properties of the planets?\nWhat is the criterion of individuation for such properties? Is the\nproperty of being the outermost planet the same as the property of\nbeing the smallest planet? What are we to say about negative\nproperties? Is it a property of the planet Saturn that it is not equal\nto the integer 17? In that case, although there are only a finite\nnumber of planets, our second-order quantifiers must range over\ninfinitely many properties. And so on. The Quinean objections are\nfamiliar. \n\nArguments of this sort had been made in the scholastic disputes\nbetween realists and nominalists: and Peirce was steeped in the\nmedieval literature on these topics. He need not have gone so far as\nto make point \\((\\gamma)\\), i.e., to argue that first-order logic is\nspecially privileged. That would in any case have run contrary to his\nlogical pluralism. But he did have the tools to make point\n\\((\\beta)\\), and to emphasize that there is an important gulf\nseparating second-order logic from first-order, just as there is an\nimportant gulf separating first-order logic from the Boolean\npropositional calculus. Why did he not make these points already in\n1885?\n\nAny answer can only be speculative. One factor, a minor one, is that\nPeirce was not himself a nominalist. Another is that he operated\nwithin a variety of logical systems: he was temperamentally eclectic,\nand not disposed to search for the \u201cone true logic\u201d. There\nare also technical considerations. Peirce, unlike Hilbert, does not\npresent first-intentional logic as an axiomatized system, nor does he\nurge it as a vehicle for studying the foundations of mathematics. He\ndoes not possess the distinction between an uninterpreted, formal,\naxiomatic calculus and its metalanguage. As a result, he does not ask\nabout questions of decidability, or completeness, or categoricity; and\nwithout the metamathematical results a full understanding of the\ndifferences in expressive power between first-order and second-order\nlogic was not available to him. One of the strongest arguments against\nsecond-order logic\u2014that quantification over all subsets of a\ndenumerable collection entails quantification over a non-denumerable\ntotality\u2014could not even have been formulated until\nCantor\u2019s Theorem was known. The logical and set-theoretical\nparadoxes were not yet discovered, and Zermelo had not yet axiomatized\nthe theory of sets: so Peirce lacked the acute sense of motivation to\ndiscover a \u201csecure foundation for mathematics\u201d. And of\ncourse Peirce had no inkling of the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorems, or\nthe Skolem paradox, or the sequence of metalogical theorems that were\nto bring first-order logic into sharp focus. He provided a flexible\nand suggestive notation that was to prove enormously fertile, and he\nwas the first to distinguish clearly between first-order and\nsecond-order logic: but the tools for understanding the\nmathematical significance of the distinction did not yet\nexist. (As Henri Pirenne once remarked, the Vikings discovered\nAmerica, but they forgot about it, because they did not yet need\nit.)\n\nA related point holds for Frege and Russell. They possessed the\nconception of a hierarchy of logical levels, and in principle they,\ntoo, could have isolated first-order logic, and thus have accomplished\nstep \\((\\alpha)\\). But they never considered isolating the lowest\nlevel of the hierarchy as a free-standing system. There are both\nphilosophical and mathematical reasons for this. As a philosophical\nmatter, the logicist project aimed to show that \u201cmathematics can\nbe reduced to logic\u201d: and they conceived of the entire hierarchy\nof types as constituting logic. And then, as a mathematical matter,\nsecond-order logic was necessary to their construction of the\nintegers. So they had no compelling reason, either philosophical or\nmathematical, that would have led them to focus on the first-order\nfragment.\n\nThere is here an instructive contrast with Peirce. Peirce, in the\nspirit of the 19th-century algebraists, was happy to\nexplore a lush abundance of logical structures: his attitude was\nfundamentally pluralist. The logicists, working in the analytical\ntradition, were more concerned to discover what the integers actually\nare: their attitude was fundamentally monistic and\nreductionist. But in order to single out first-order logic as was done\nin the 1930s, two things were needed: an awareness that there were\ndistinct logical systems, and an argument for preferring one to the\nother. Peirce had the pluralism: the logicists had the urge to find a\n\u201ccorrect\u201d system: but neither had both.\n\nLet us now turn to the question, Was the emergence of first-order\nlogic inevitable? It is impossible to avoid counterfactual\nconsiderations, and the answer must be more speculative. And here,\ntoo, it is necessary to distinguish between the inevitability of the\ntechnical results \\((\\beta)\\), and the inevitability of point\n\\((\\gamma)\\).\n\nLet us start with point \\((\\beta)\\). By 1928, the metalogical results\ncan fairly be said to have been inevitable. Hilbert & Ackermann\nhad isolated and described first-order logic; the distinction between\nmathematics and meta-mathematics was by then well understood; they had\nshown how to prove the completeness of the propositional calculus; and\nthey explicitly raised the completeness of first-order logic as an\nimportant open problem. It was certain that, within the next few\nyears, some enterprising logician would provide an answer: as it\nhappened, G\u00f6del got there first. It would then have been an\nobvious next step to inquire about the completeness of higher-order\nsystems. So within a few years of Hilbert & Ackermann the basic\nmetalogical theorems would have been established.\n\nIf that is correct, then Hilbert\u2019s decisive step in the 1917/18\nlectures was not the isolation of first-order logic\u2014i.e., not\nstep \\((\\alpha)\\). That was a comparatively insignificant matter. That\nstep had already been taken explicitly by Peirce, and tacitly by Weyl\nand L\u00f6wenheim. Hilbert did not treat it as important, and appears\nto have viewed it primarily as an expository device, a means of\nsimplifying the presentation of the logic of Principia\nMathematica. The important step in 1917 was rather the\nintroduction of techniques of metamathematics, and the explicit posing\nof questions of completeness and consistency and decidability. To pose\nthese questions for systems of logic was an enormous conceptual leap,\nand Hilbert understood it as such. His own first attempts, made in his\n1905 Heidelberg address, had\ncollapsed under the criticisms of Poincar\u00e9, and he had\nstruggled to find a satisfactory formulation. And even after\nhe had introduced his metalogical distinctions in his papers of the\n1920s, logicians of the caliber of Russell and Brouwer and Ramsey had\ndifficulty in understanding what he was attempting to do.\nThis development was in 1917 anything but inevitable: and\nwithout the introduction of the metalogical techniques the history of\nlogic and proof theory in the 1920s and 1930s would have looked very\ndifferent. Would the G\u00f6del theorems ever have been conceived?\nWould the work of L\u00f6wenheim or Skolem or Zermelo independently\nhave led to an investigation of the metalogical properties of\nfirst-order logic? One can in retrospect imagine an alternative path\nto the technical results \\((\\beta)\\), but there is no reason to\nsuppose that they were fated to emerge either when they did, or as\nthey did.\n\nA subtler issue arises if we turn now to point \\((\\gamma)\\) and ask:\nWas it inevitable that first-order logic would come to be regarded\nas a \u201cprivileged\u201d logical system? As we saw, the\nmetalogical results of the 1930s do not settle the primacy of\nfirst-order logic. The \u201cprivileging\u201d came later, and seems\nrather to have depended on philosophical considerations: the need to\navoid the set-theoretical paradoxes, a search for secure foundations\nfor mathematics, a desire to accommodate the objections of Brouwer and\nWeyl, a sense that higher-order logics were both methodologically\nsuspect and avoidable. All these things show the continuing influence\nof the Grundlagenkrise of the 1920s, which did so much to set\nthe terms of the subsequent philosophical understanding of the\nfoundations of mathematics.\n\nIt is therefore important to stress that an alternative history was\npossible, and that the Grundlagenkrise was entirely absent\nfrom Hilbert\u2019s logical writings in 1917/18. The names of Brouwer\nand Weyl are nowhere mentioned. Hilbert is of course aware of the\nparadoxes (which he had known about since 1897), but had long believed\nthat Zermelo\u2019s axiomatization had shown how to avoid them. Nor\ndo we find in his writings any quest for the \u201cone true\nlogic\u201d. On the contrary. Both in 1917/18 and in the unpublished\nlecture notes from the early 1920s the emphasis is on using the new\nmetalogical techniques to explore the strengths and weaknesses of a\ndiversity of logical systems. The work is explicitly undertaken in the\nspirit of his studies of the axioms of geometry. He will take up a\nsystem, explore it for a while, then drop it to examine something\nelse. In his pluralism and in his pragmatic, experimental attitude he\nis closer to Peirce than to the logicists.\n\nThe Grundlagenkrise and his public, polemical exchanges with\nBrouwer came later, and they gave a distorted picture of the\nmotivations behind his logical investigations. What was the impact of\nthese philosophical debates on the technical aspects of his\nprogram? For the formulation of first-order logic, and for the posing\nof metalogical questions, the answer is easy: there was no impact\nwhatsoever. The contents of Hilbert & Ackermann 1928 were already\npresent in the 1917/18 lectures. As for Hilbert\u2019s\nproof-theoretic research of the 1920s, the main lines of development\nemerged quite independently of Brouwer and Weyl. The polemics might\nhave added a sense of urgency, but it is hard to detect any influence\non the actual mathematics.\n\nSo even if we imagine the philosophical Grundlagenkrise\nentirely removed from the picture, the technical results of the\nHilbert school would not have been significantly affected. The\ncompleteness and incompleteness results would, in all likelihood, have\narrived more or less on schedule. (It is worthwhile to note that\nBernays and Hilbert had contemplated the possibility of various sorts\nof incompleteness as early as 1928: see the discussion by Wilfried\nSieg in Hilbert [LFL]: 792\u2013796.) But those results would have\nemerged in a very different philosophical climate. The incompleteness\ntheorems would likely have been greeted as an important technical\ncontribution within the broader Hilbert program, rather than as its\ndramatic refutation. Perhaps (as Angus Macintyre 2011 has suggested)\nthey would have been viewed more like the independence results in set\ntheory, with less talk about the limits of mathematical\ncreativity.\n\nIn other words, far from being inevitable, the emergence, towards the\nend of the 1930s, of first-order logic as a privileged system\nof logic depended on two things, each independent of the other. On the\nmathematical side, it depended on Hilbert\u2019s introduction of\nmetalogical techniques; on the philosophical side, it depended on the\narguments of the Grundlagenkrise. Neither of these things was\ninevitable: nor was the fact that they occurred at roughly the same\ntime. With a different history, Hilbert\u2019s flexible attitude\nmight have prevailed, and there might have been more emphasis on\nhigher-order systems, or on the exploration of algebraic logics,\ninfinitary logics, category-theoretic systems, and the like: in short,\non logical pluralism. \n\nIt is worthwhile to observe that, as the philosophical concerns of the\nGrundlagenkrise have receded, and as new approaches from the\ndirection of computer science and homotopy theory have entered the\nfield, the primacy of first-order logic is open to\nreconsideration.\n",
