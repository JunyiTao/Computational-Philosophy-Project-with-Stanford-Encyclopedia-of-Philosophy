    "main_text": "Self-Interest Theory\n3. Self-Interest Theory\n\n\nThe modern view of the fallacy of composition in social choice is a\nproduct of the understanding of politics as self-interested. That\nunderstanding begins partially with Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who\nadvised the prince to act from his own self-interest. A century later,\nHobbes did not bother to advise acting from self-interest because he\nsupposed virtually everyone naturally does so. From that assumption, he\nwent on to give us the first modern political theory of the state, an\nexplanatory political theory that is not merely a handbook for the\nprince and that is not grounded in normative assumptions of religious\ncommitment. To some extent, therefore, one could credit Hobbes with the\ninvention of social science and of explanatory, as opposed to\nhortatory, political theory.\n\n\nHobbes\u2019s argument for the state is an argument from mutual\nadvantage. We all benefit if there is a powerful state in place to\nregulate behavior, thereby enabling us to invest efforts in producing\nthings to make our lives better and to enable us to exchange with each\nother without fear that others will wreck our efforts. Some scholars\nsee this resolution as a matter of mutual cooperation in a grand\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma. This is strategically or game theoretically wrong\nbecause putting a state in place is a matter of coordination on one or\nanother sovereign, not a matter of exchange among us or between us and\nthe sovereign. Once that state is in place, it might be true that I\nwould rather free ride on the better behavior of my fellow citizens, who\nare generally law-abiding. But I generally cannot succeed in doing so,\nbecause there is police power to coerce me if necessary.\n\n\nWhat I cannot free ride on is the creation of a state. I want the\nstate, just as everyone who sees it as mutually advantageous wants it.\nSuppose that somehow, perhaps using the ring of Gyges to make me\ninvisible as Glaucon proposed, I could get away with theft or other\ncrimes. Even then, I would still want the state to have the power to\ncoerce people into order because if they are not orderly, they will\nproduce nothing for me to steal. If it is true, as Hobbes supposes,\nthat having a state is mutually advantageous, it follows that we all\nwant it; and none of us can free ride on whether there is a\nstate. Either there is one or there is not, and if there is one, then I\nam potentially subject to its powers of legal coercion. On balance, I\nwould want there to be an effective state for the protections it gives\nme against others despite its potential for coercing me into good\nbehavior.\n\n\nWhen we vote on a policy, as discussed above, we de facto change our\nproblem from a collective-action prisoner\u2019s dilemma into a simple\ncoordination problem by ruling out individual idiosyncrasies in our\nchoices. We have only collective choice: provision for all or provision\nfor none. Although the state is itself not the resolution of a giant\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma or collective action, as is sometimes supposed, it\ncan be used to resolve prisoner\u2019s dilemma interactions. Suppose you and\nI both want cleaner air but that each of us would free ride on the\nefforts of others to clean the air. State policy can block free riding,\nif necessary at metaphorical gunpoint. We both prefer the general\neffort to provide cleaner air and we both pay our share toward the cost\nof providing it.\n",
