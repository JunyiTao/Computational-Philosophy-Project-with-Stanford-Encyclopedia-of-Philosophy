    "main_text": "A History of the Gene Within the History of Genetics || Genomics and post-genomics\n1.5 Genomics and post-genomics\n\nIn the late 1970s, Sanger developed methods for sequencing DNA. The\n1980s then saw the automation of these methods (Garc\u00eda-Sancho\n2012). This made\u00a0whole genome sequencing of humans and other\norganisms feasible, and the Human Genome Project (HGP) commenced work\nin 1990 (Bostanci 2004; entry on\n the human genome project).\n New parallel, or \u201cnext generation\u201d, sequencing methods\nthat emerged around 2005 made sequencing faster and cheaper.\nAccordingly, the number of species and human samples sequenced\nincreased continually. Since the early days of protein sequencing,\nsequence data was stored in digital databases, with GenBank being\namong the most important sequence repositories (Strasser 2019).\nGenomics, the science of analyzing and comparing genomes was thus\nstrongly aligned with bioinformatics. Sequence comparison once more\ntransformed evolutionary genetics and enabled new comparative\napproaches; now the DNA sequence itself could be used to reconstruct\nphylogenetic trees, and patterns of duplication events could be\ntracked in more detail (Su\u00e1rez-D\u00edaz 2010). Microbial\nsystematics and ecology, in particular, changed significantly when\nmetagenomic approaches, i.e., the sequencing of whole microbial\ncommunities, revealed not only the diversity of microbial life, but\nalso the amount of lateral gene transfer between organisms, including\neukaryotes (O\u2019Malley 2014). But the availability of large data\nsets on human genomes also fostered novel interest in human diversity\nand history, enhanced medical genetics and the use of genetic data in\nforensics, and led to the emergence of direct-to-consumer genetic\ntesting (Atkinson et al. 2009; Gibbon et al. 2018).\n\nOne of the unexpected results of the HGP was that the human genome\ncontained only about 23,000 protein-coding genes as defined based on\nthe concept of an open reading frame (ORF), that is, a stretch of DNA\nthat begins with a start and ends with stop codon that initiate and\nterminate translation. Other, apparently less complex organisms, had\nas many or even more genes (thus defined) in their genomes (G-value\nparadox). This fact again suggested the significance of splicing\nvariants and other mechanisms increasing the number of proteins\nderived from a given genome, of regulatory elements in the genome, and\nof non-coding RNA (see entry on\n genomics and postgenomics).\n In 2003 the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project was\ninitiated, aiming at identifying all functional elements in the human\ngenome including those transcribed to non-protein-coding RNA, and\nsites for protein binding or epigenetic modification (Brzovi\u0107\n& \u0160ustar 2020). The results of the consortium\u2019s work\nmade the already known deviations from the classic model of the\nmolecular, protein-coding gene appear as the rule rather than the\nexception. To a large extent ENCODE researchers found overlap of\ntranscripts, products derived from widely separated pieces of DNA\nsequence and widely dispersed regulatory sequences for a given gene.\nThe findings also confirm that most of the genome is transcribed and\nemphasize the importance and pervasiveness of functional non-coding\nRNA transcripts (Morange 2020: Ch. 25; O\u2019Malley et al. 2010;\nVeigl 2021).\n\nThese developments belong to what is commonly referred to as\n\u201cpost-genomics\u201d (Richardson & Stevens 2015). Next to\nDNA, so-called \u201comics\u201d research studies the transcriptome,\nthe proteome, the interactome, and other levels of cellular processes\nand is strongly driven by new technological developments. DNA and\nprotein microarrays (biochips) have been instrumental in this respect,\nand the investigation of RNA transcripts has been even further\nenhanced by next generation RNA sequencing (Rheinberger &\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2018: Ch. 9). Such high-throughput technologies\nresult in massive amounts of diverse types of data. Bio-ontologies,\nand database infrastructures and curation, accordingly, became a\ncentral aspect of molecular biological research (Leonelli 2016).\n\nWhile relevant mechanisms were first characterized in the 1960s and\n70s, omics-approaches have furthered the study of cellular\nepigenetics, referring to molecular mechanisms including DNA\nmethylation, changes in chromatin structure, and non-coding RNA\nrelated regulation (Buklijas 2018; Morange 2020: Ch. 26; Nicoglou\n& Merlin 2017). These mechanisms can result in patterns of\ndifferential gene expression that remain stable across mitotic cell\ndivision, thus contributing to the explanation of development.\nEpigenetic modifications have also been shown to be conserved in\nmeiosis, facilitating the inheritance of phenotypic variation across\ngenerations, independently of changes in DNA sequence, a fact with\nconsequences for evolutionary biology (Jablonka & Raz 2009).\n\nThe availability of data sets also enabled new, technology-driven\nstyles of biological research (Morange 2020: Ch. 28; Rheinberger &\nM\u00fcller-Wille 2018: Ch. 9; entry on\n philosophy of systems and synthetic biology).\n Systems biology emerged as a highly interdisciplinary field, which is\ncharacterized by mathematical and computational approaches to the\ntopology and dynamics of interaction networks involving genes and gene\nproducts. In a complementary manner, synthetic biology focuses on\nengineering metabolic pathways and regulatory networks for\nbiotechnological applications such as drug or biofuel production, but\nalso to increase the understanding of molecular systems (Kastenhofer\n2013). The CRISPR-Cas system, originally elucidated as a bacterial\nimmune defense mechanism, was developed into a new tool for genome\nediting, which, due to its precision, also enhanced genetic\nengineering approaches in multicellular organisms (Morange 2020: Ch.\n24).\n\nIt becomes clear that biological research remains dynamic and that\nevery development sheds new light on questions of heredity and the\nfunctioning of DNA. With the developments presented in this part in\nmind, we shall now turn to some of the philosophical debates they have\nengendered.\n",
