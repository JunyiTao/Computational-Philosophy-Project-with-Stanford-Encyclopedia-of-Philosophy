    "main_text": "Recognition\n5. Recognition\n\nPrice\u2019s third main contribution is his ambitious analysis of\nthinking, specifically of how what Price calls \u201cfull concept\napplication\u201d emerges from its roots in experience (especially\n1953a). Price\u2019s answer, in brief, is that it emerges because the\nrecipients of experience are intelligent. Price stresses an\nenvironmental condition for concept-formation: the presence\nof \u201crecurrence\u201d in our environment. Thus, there are lots\nof red things, worms, leaves, and so on. Price claims that without\nrecurrence for us to encounter there could be no thought. Incessant\nnovelty would block conceptual acquisition.\n\nPrice\u2019s interesting claim is not obviously true. To be entitled\nto hold that single examples are not enough, Price must provide a\ntheory of concept-formation.\n",
