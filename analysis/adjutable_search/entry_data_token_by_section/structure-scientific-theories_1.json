    "main_text": "Introduction || Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Views: The Basics\n1.1 Syntactic, Semantic, and Pragmatic Views: The Basics\n\nIt will be helpful to pare each perspective down to its essence. Each\nendorses a substantive thesis about the structure of scientific\ntheories.\n\nFor the Syntactic View, the structure of a scientific theory is its\nreconstruction in terms of sentences cast in a metamathematical\nlanguage. Metamathematics is the axiomatic machinery for building\nclear foundations of mathematics, and includes predicate logic, set\ntheory, and model theory (e.g., Zach 2009; Hacking 2014). A central\nquestion of the Syntactic View is: in which logical language should we\nrecast scientific theory?\n\nSome defenders of the Semantic View keep important aspects of this\nreconstructive agenda, moving the metamathematical apparatus from\npredicate logic to set theory. Other advocates of the Semantic View\ninsist that the structure of scientific theory is solely mathematical.\nThey argue that we should remain at the mathematical level, rather\nthan move up (or down) a level, into foundations of mathematics. A\ncentral question for the Semantic View is: which mathematical models\nare actually used in science?\n\nFinally, for the Pragmatic View, scientific theory is internally and\nexternally complex. Mathematical components, while often present, are\nneither necessary nor sufficient for characterizing the core structure\nof scientific theories. Theory also consists of a rich variety of\nnonformal components (e.g., analogies and natural kinds). Thus, the\nPragmatic View argues, a proper analysis of the grammar (syntax) and\nmeaning (semantics) of theory must pay heed to scientific theory\ncomplexity, as well as to the multifarious assumptions, purposes,\nvalues, and practices informing theory. A central question the\nPragmatic View poses is: which theory components and which modes of\ntheorizing are present in scientific theories found across a variety\nof disciplines?\n\nIn adopting a descriptive perspective on the structure of\nscientific theories, each view also deploys, at least implicitly, a\nprescriptive characterization of our central topic. In other\nwords, postulating that scientific theory is \\(X\\) (e.g., \\(X\\) = a\nset-theoretic structure, as per Suppes 1960, 1962, 1967, 1968, 2002)\nalso implies that what is not \\(X\\) (or could not be recast as \\(X\\))\nis not (or could not possibly be) a scientific theory, and would not\nhelp us in providing scientific understanding, explanation,\nprediction, and intervention. For the Syntactic View, what is not (or\ncannot be) reconstructed axiomatically is not theoretical, while for\nthe Semantic View, what is not (or cannot be) modeled mathematically\nis not theoretical. In contrast, in part due to its pluralism about\nwhat a scientific theory actually (and possibly) is, and because it\ninterprets theory structure as distributed in practices, the Pragmatic\nView resists the definitional and normative terms set by the other two\nviews. As a result, the Pragmatic View ultimately reforms the very\nconcepts of \u201ctheory\u201d and \u201ctheory structure.\u201d\n\n\nThis encyclopedia entry will be organized as follows. After presenting\nthis piece\u2019s two sustained examples, immediately below, the\nthree views are reviewed in as many substantive sections. Each section\nstarts with a brief overview before characterizing that\nperspective\u2019s account of theory structure. Newtonian mechanics\nis used as a running example within each section. The interpretation\nof theory structure\u2014viz., how theory \u201chooks up\u201d with\nphenomena, experiment, and the world\u2014is also reviewed in each\nsection. In the final section of this entry, we turn to population\ngenetics and an analysis of the Hardy-Weinberg Principle (HWP) to\ncompare and contrast each view. The Conclusion suggests, and remains\nnon-committal about, three kinds of relations among the views:\nidentity, combat, and complementarity.\nTheory is not a single, static entity that we are seeing from three\ndifferent perspectives, as we might represent the Earth using three\ndistinct mathematical map projections. Rather, theory itself changes\nas a consequence of perspective adopted.\n",
