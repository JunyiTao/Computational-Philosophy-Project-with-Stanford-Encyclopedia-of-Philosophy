    "main_text": "Biography\n1. Biography\n\nWhewell was born in 1794, the eldest child of a master-carpenter in\nLancaster. The headmaster of his local grammar school, a parish\npriest, recognized Whewell\u2019s intellectual abilities and\npersuaded his father to allow him to attend the Heversham Grammar\nSchool in Westmorland, some twelve miles to the north, where he would\nbe able to qualify for a closed exhibition to Trinity College,\nCambridge. In the 19th century and earlier, these \u201cclosed\nexhibitions\u201d or scholarships were set aside for the children of\nworking class parents, to allow for some social mobility. Whewell\nstudied at Heversham Grammar for two years, and received private\ncoaching in mathematics. Although he did win the exhibition it did not\nprovide full resources for a boy of his family\u2019s means to attend\nCambridge; so money had to be raised in a public subscription to\nsupplement the scholarship money.\n\nHe thus came up to Trinity in 1812 as a \u201csub-sizar\u201d\n(scholarship student). In 1814 he won the Chancellor\u2019s prize for\nhis epic poem \u201cBoadicea,\u201d in this way following in the\nfootsteps of his mother, Elizabeth Whewell, who had published poems in\nthe local papers. Yet he did not neglect the mathematical side of his\ntraining; in 1816 he proved his mathematical prowess by placing as\nboth second Wrangler and second Smith\u2019s Prize man. The following\nyear he won a college fellowship. He was elected to the Royal Society\nin 1820, and ordained a priest (as required for Trinity Fellows) in\n1825. He took up the Chair in Mineralogy in 1828, and resigned it in\n1832. In 1838 Whewell became Professor of Moral Philosophy. Almost\nimmediately after his marriage to Cordelia Marshall on 12 October\n1841, he was named Master of Trinity College upon the recommendation\nof the Prime Minister Robert Peel. He was Vice-Chancellor of the\nUniversity in 1842 and again in 1855. In 1848 he played a large role\nin establishing the Natural and Moral Sciences Triposes at the\nUniversity. His first wife died in 1855, and he later married Lady\nEvalina Affleck, the widowed sister of his friend Robert Ellis. Lady\nAffleck died in 1865. Whewell had no children. He died, after being\nthrown from his horse, on 6 March 1866. (More details about\nWhewell\u2019s life and times can be found in Snyder 2011.)\n",
