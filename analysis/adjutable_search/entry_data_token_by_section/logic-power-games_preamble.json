    "main_text": "\n\nThis entry discusses the use of mathematical languages to express and\nanalyze the formal properties of power in games. The mathematical\nlanguages discussed in this entry will be referred to as\nlogics, and classified according to their ability to\nexpress game-related concepts.\n\nThe material in this entry will be limited to the logical analysis of\nstrategies and preferences of (groups of) individuals in cooperative\nand non-cooperative normal form games. It will not cover the use of\ngame theory to study logical languages nor the role of epistemic\nconcepts in strategic decisions. It will also not cover aspects of\nsequential decisions-making, typical of strategic reasoning in\nextensive games. An account of those can be found in the related\nentries\n logic and games,\n epistemic foundations of game theory (see also van Benthem, Pacuit, & Roy 2011 and van\nBenthem 2014).\n",
