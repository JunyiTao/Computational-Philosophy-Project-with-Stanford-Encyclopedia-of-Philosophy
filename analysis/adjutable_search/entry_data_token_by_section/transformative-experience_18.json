    "main_text": "Applied Ethics: In Light of Transformation, How Should We Treat Others? || Long Term Decisions\n6.2 Long Term Decisions\n\nIn addition to transforming in the early and late stages of life,\npeople transform throughout their lives, either via momentous\n\u201cbig\u201d changes or via an accumulation of\n\u201csmall\u201d changes. Long-term decisions must factor the\npotential for transformative change into account. For instance, Lackey\n(2020) and Chan (2020) independently address this issue in the context\nof punishment. Lackey\u2019s argument demands that those with the\npower to issue long-term punishments, like judges, must consider the\npossibility of transformative change. Plausibly, punishment should be\nsensitive to the relevant evidence available at that time. We know\nthat people change, often in transformative ways, and imprisonment\nseems like exactly the type of experience that would be\ntransformative. Issuing strict, long-term prison sentences\u2014such\nas life sentences without the possibility of parole\u2014screens off\nthe possibility of taking relevant future evidence into account. Thus,\nrecognizing the possibility of transformation offers a powerful\nargument for sentencing reform.\n\nExtended partnerships also provide another context in which\ntransformative changes need to be accounted for when making long term\ndecisions. For instance, marriage vows typically involve some type of\nlife-long pledge. And, as anyone familiar with married people knows,\npeople change in ways that disrupt the marriage. In a way, identifying\nthese changes as transformative makes sense of an already common\nphenomenon. But it also raises a further question: how can one\nfelicitously make a life-long promise to someone knowing that both\nthey and their partner may transform in a way involving a radical\nshift of preferences and life goals? The centrality of transformation\nto this decision is doubled because the marriage itself is often\ntransformative. It\u2019s true that transformations connected with\nrelationships tend to involve incremental changes because the\nrelationship develops incrementally. But these incremental changes can\nlead people away from each other and won\u2019t be noticeable until\nthe larger schism develops due to their incremental nature.\n\nThese long-term decisions involving others suggest that the normative\nquestions transformative experiences raise go beyond self-interested\ndecision making. Furthermore, some of the proposed ways of making\ntransformative decisions have interesting implications for these types\nof cases. For instance, Ullmann-Margalit suggests that there simply is\nnot a rational way to make transformative decisions. Applying that to\nthese cases gives the radical result that decision to marry or\nsentence someone to prison cannot be made rationally!\nUllmann-Margalit\u2019s further suggestion that perhaps these\ndecisions can be made reasonably also has interesting implications.\nShe suggests that minimizing the discontinuity of a big decision and\nbacking off the point of no return might help, and includes moving in\nbefore marriage as one such way to ease reasonably into a big decision\nlike marriage. The application for the prison case is even more\ninteresting, for it suggests that life in prison should not be such a\nradical departure from life outside of it, and that there must be\nmeaningful short term possibilities for parole.\n",
