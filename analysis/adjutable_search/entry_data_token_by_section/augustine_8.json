    "main_text": "Anthropology: God and the Soul; Soul and Body || The Human Mind as an Image of God\n6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God;\n Augustine does not, however, claim that the mind\u2019s certainty\nabout itself entails a similar certainty about the nature of God).\nAugustine\u2019s cogito argument is not limited to epistemology but\ncan also be employed in an ethical context because it proves not only\nmy existence and my thinking (and, by implication, my being alive) but\nalso my loving and willing. I am as certain that I will as I am\ncertain that I exist and live, and my will is as undeniably mine as is\nmy existence and my life. Therefore, my volitions are imputable to me,\nand it is I who am responsible for my choices (and not some evil\nsubstance present in my soul but foreign to my own self, as, on\nAugustine\u2019s interpretation, Manichean dualism would have it; cf.\nDe duabus animabus 13; Confessiones 7.5; De\ncivitate dei 5.10).\n5.2 Illumination\n\nAugustine\u2019s theory of knowledge\u2014his so-called doctrine of\nillumination\u2014is a distinctly non-empiricist epistemology based\non a probably Neoplatonic reading of Plato\u2019s doctrine of\nrecollection (Burnyeat 1987; MacDonald 2012b; King 2014a:\n147\u2013152; Karf\u00edkov\u00e1 2017). Like Plato and his\nfollowers, Augustine thinks that true knowledge requires first-hand\nacquaintance; second-hand information, e.g., from reliable testimony,\nmay yield true and even justifiable belief, but not knowledge in the\nstrict sense.\n In the case of sensible objects\u2014which, strictly speaking, do\nnot admit of knowledge at all but only opinion\u2014such\n first-hand acquaintance is possible through sense perception.\nCognition of intelligible objects, however, can be neither reached\nempirically by means of abstraction nor transmitted to us\nlinguistically by a human teacher (see\n 5.4 Language and Signs);\n rather, such cognition requires personal intellectual activity that\nresults in an intellectual insight, which we judge by a criterion we\nfind nowhere but in ourselves. The paradigm of this kind of cognition\nare mathematical and logical truths and fundamental moral intuitions,\nwhich we understand not because we believe a teacher or a book but\nbecause we see them for ourselves (De magistro 40, cf. De\nlibero arbitrio 2.34). The condition of possibility and the\ncriterion of truth of this intellectual insight is none other than God\n(a view attributed, with explicit approval, to the Platonists in\nDe civitate dei 8.7), who, in the manner of a Neoplatonic\nimmaterial principle, is both immanent and transcendent in relation to\nour soul. Augustine mostly explains this Platonizing theory of a\npriori knowledge by means of two striking images: the inner teacher\nand illumination. The former is introduced in the dialogue De\nmagistro (ca. 390) and remains frequent especially in the sermons\n(e.g., In epistulam Iohannis ad Parthos tractatus decem 3.13;\nFuhrer 2018b); according to it, Christ is present in our souls and by\n\u201cpresiding over\u201d them like a teacher guarantees the\ntruthfulness of our understanding (De magistro 38\u201339,\ncf. Ephesians 3:17 for the image and, for the idea that truth\n\u201clives in the inner man\u201d, De vera religione 72).\nThe latter appears first in the Soliloquia (1.12\u201315)\nand is ubiquitous in Augustine\u2019s writings (cf. esp. De\ntrinitate 12.24). It is ultimately derived from the Analogy of\nthe Sun in Plato\u2019s Republic (508a-509b; cf. Rist 1994:\n78\u201379). In the Soliloquia Augustine says, in a manner\nstrongly reminiscent of Plato, that just as the sun is both visible\nitself and illumines the objects of sight so as to enable the eye to\nsee them, God is intelligible himself and illumines the intelligible\nobjects (which are here identified with the objects of the liberal\ndisciplines and subordinated to God) so as to enable reason (the\n\u201ceye\u201d of the soul) to activate its capacity for\nintellection. The later version in De trinitate explicitly\npresents divine illumination as an alternative to Platonic\nrecollection and situates it in the framework of a theory of creation.\nHere Augustine says that the human mind has been created by God in\nsuch a way as to be \u201cconnected\u201d to intelligible reality\n\u201cfrom below\u201d (subiuncta) and with a capacity\n(capacitas) that enables it to \u201csee\u201d the\nintelligibles in the light of intelligible truth, just as the eye is\nby nature able to see colors in the light of the sun. Obviously,\n\u201ccapacity\u201d in this case does not mean pure potentiality\n(as in the tabula rasa theory endorsed by Augustine\u2019s\ninterlocutor Euodius in De quantitate animae 34) but\ncomprises at least implicit or latent knowledge of moral and\nepistemological standards. Both images, if properly read, should\npreclude the misunderstanding that Augustine\u2019s gnoseology makes\nhuman knowledge entirely dependent on divine agency, with the human\nbeing becoming merely a passive recipient of revelation (cf. Gilson\n1943: ch. 4 and Lagouan\u00e8re 2012: 158\u2013180 for the debates\nabout Augustinian illumination in medieval and modern philosophy).\nCognition does not simply result from the presence of Christ in our\nsoul but from our \u201cconsulting\u201d the inner teacher, i.e.,\nour testing propositions that claim to convey a truth about\nintelligible reality (or even a general truth about sensible objects,\ncf. Letter 13.3\u20134) against the inner standards we\npossess thanks to the presence of Christ (De magistro\n37\u201338; this way of \u201cconsulting\u201d the inner truth is\nrepeatedly dramatized in the Confessiones, e.g., 11.10;\n11.31; Cary 2008b: 100). And while every human being is\n\u201cillumined\u201d by the divine light at least from behind so as\nto be able to pass true judgments about right and wrong or good and\nevil, in order to develop these natural intuitions to full knowledge\nor wisdom and to be able actually to lead a virtuous life, we need to\nconvert to God, the \u201csource\u201d of the light (De\ntrinitate 14.21). Thus, while all human beings are by nature\ncapable of accessing intelligible truth, only those succeed in doing\nso who have a sufficiently good will (De magistro\n38)\u2014presumably those who endorse Christian religion and live\naccordingly. This strong voluntary element intimately connects\nAugustine\u2019s epistemology with his ethics and, ultimately, with\nhis doctrine of grace (on the parallel structure of cognition and grace in Augustine\nsee Lorenz 1964). Like all human agency, striving for wisdom takes place\nunder the conditions of a fallen world and meets the difficulties and\nhindrances humanity is subject to because of original sin.\n\nIn order to illustrate what he means by \u201cseeing things by\nourselves\u201d \u201cin the light of truth\u201d, Augustine often\ncites the example of the Socratic maieutic dialogue (De\nmagistro 40; cf. De immortalitate animae 6; De\ntrinitate 12.24), and in some passages of his early work he seems\nto subscribe to the Platonic doctrine of recollection (familiar to him\nfrom Cicero, Tusculan Disputations 1.57) in such a way as to\nimply the preexistence of the soul (Soliloquia 2.35,\nretracted in Retractationes 1.4.4; De immortalitate\nanimae 6; De quantitate animae 34, retracted in\nRetractationes 1.8.2). It is difficult to tell whether the\nearly Augustine literally believed in recollection and preexistence\n(Karf\u00edkov\u00e1 2017; O\u2019Daly 1987: 70\u201375;\n199\u2013207), not least because he was aware that some Neoplatonists\ninterpreted Platonic recollection as an actualization of our\never-present but latent knowledge of the intelligible rather than as a\nremembrance of our past acquaintance with it (Letter 7.2, cf.\nPlotinus, Enneads IV.3.25.31\u201333; O\u2019Daly 1976).\nIf, as in De immortalitate animae 6, recollection is taken to\nprove the immortality of the soul (as it did in the Phaedo),\nit is hard to see how preexistence should not be implied. In any\nevent, it is imprecise to say, as it is sometimes done, that Augustine\ngave up the theory of recollection because he realized that\npreexistence was at variance with Christian faith. In De civitate\ndei (12.14 etc.) Augustine emphatically rejects\nPlatonic-Pythagorean metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls as\nincompatible with eternal happiness and the economy of salvation, and\nin De trinitate (12.24) the Meno version of the\nrecollection theory, which implies transmigration, is rejected in\nfavor of illumination. Yet it is a fallacy to claim that recollection\nentails transmigration. The early Augustine may have believed in\npreexistence (perhaps simply as a corollary of the immortality of the\nsoul), but there is no evidence that he believed in the transmigration\nof souls; conversely, his rejection of transmigration did not prevent\neven the late Augustine from considering preexistence\u2014at least\ntheoretically\u2014an option for the origin of the soul\n(Letter 143.6 from 412; cf.\n 6.1 Soul as a Created Being).\n5.3 Faith and Reason\n\nWhereas modern discussion tends to regard faith and reason as\nalternative or even mutually exclusive ways to (religious) truth, in\nAugustine\u2019s epistemological and exegetical program the two are\ninseparable. He rejects the rationalism of the philosophers and,\nespecially, the Manicheans as an unwarranted over-confidence into the\nabilities of human reason resulting from sinful pride and as an\narrogant neglect of the revelation of Christ in Scripture (De\nlibero arbitrio 3.56; 60; Confessiones 3.10\u201312).\nAgainst the fideism he encountered in some Christian circles (cf.\nLetter 119 from Consentius to Augustine) he insisted that it\nwas good and natural to employ the rational capacity we have been\ncreated with to search for an understanding of the truths we accept\nfrom the authority of the biblical revelation, even though a true\nunderstanding of God will only be possible after this life when we see\nhim \u201cface to face\u201d (Letter 120.3\u20134). In\nthis epistemological and exegetical program, which since Anselm of\nCanterbury has aptly been labeled as \u201cfaith seeking\nunderstanding\u201d (cf. De trinitate 15.2: fides\nquaerit, intellectus invenit) or \u201cunderstanding of\nfaith\u201d (intellectus fidei), faith is prior to\nunderstanding in time but posterior to it in importance and value\n(De ordine 2.26; De vera religione 45;\nLetter 120.3; van Fleteren 2010). The first step toward\nperfection is to believe the words of Scripture; the second is to\nrealize that the words are outward signs of an internal and\nintelligible reality and that they admonish us to turn to and to\n\u201cconsult\u201d inner truth so as to reach true understanding\nand, accordingly, the good life (cf.\n 5.2 Illumination;\n 5.4 Language and Signs). \nPhilosophical argument may be of help in this process;\nyet as Augustine notes as early as in Contra Academicos\n(3.43), it needs to be tied to the authority of Scripture and the\nCreed to prevent the frailty of human reason from going astray (cf.\nConfessiones 7.13). The Augustine of the earliest dialogues\nseems to have entertained the elitist idea that those educated in the\nliberal arts and capable of the Neoplatonic intellectual ascent may\nactually outgrow authority and achieve a full understanding of the\ndivine already in this life (De ordine 2.26, but contrast ib.\n2.45 on Monnica). In his later work, he abandons this hope and\nemphasizes that during this life, inevitably characterized by sin and\nweakness, every human being remains in need of the guidance of the\nrevealed authority of Christ (Cary 2008b: 109\u2013120). Faith is\nthus not just an epistemological but also an ethical category; it is\nessential for the moral purification we need to undergo before we can\nhope for even a glimpse of true understanding (Soliloquia\n1.12; De diversis quaestionibus 48; De trinitate\n4.24; Rist 2001). To a great extent, Augustine\u2019s defense of\nfaith as a valid epistemic category rests on a rehabilitation of true\nbelief against the philosophical (Platonic and Hellenistic) tradition.\nAugustine neatly distinguishes \u201cbelief\u201d (fides,\nthe word he also uses for religious faith), which entails the\nbeliever\u2019s awareness that he does not know, from\n\u201copinion\u201d (opinio), defined by the philosophers\nas the illusion of knowing what one in fact does not know (De\nutilitate credendi 25; Letter 120.3). Without belief in\nthe former sense, we would have to admit that we are ignorant of our\nown lineage (Confessiones 6.7) and of the objects of the\nhistorical and empirical sciences, of which, as Augustine asserts in a\ncritique of Platonism, first-hand knowledge is rarely possible (De\ntrinitate 4.21). The belief that a person we have not seen was or\nis just may trigger our fraternal love for him (De trinitate\n8.7; Bouton-Touboulic 2012: 182\u2013187; conversely, Augustine asks\nthose who are united with him in fraternal love to believe what he\ntells them about his life, Confessiones 10.3). And obviously,\nthe crucial events of the history of salvation, Jesus\u2019 death on\nthe cross and his resurrection, cannot be known but only believed qua\nhistorical events, even though qua signs they may lead to\nunderstanding by prompting us to an intelligible truth (De\ntrinitate 13.2). Thus, while no doubt faith in revelation\nprecedes rational insight into its true meaning, the decision about\nwhose authority to believe and whom to accept as a reliable witness is\nitself reasonable (De vera religione 45; Letter\n120.3). Even so, belief may of course be deceived (De\ntrinitate 8.6). In ordinary life, this is inevitable and mostly\nunproblematic. A more serious problem is the justification of belief\nin Scripture, which, for Augustine, is the tradition and authority\n(auctoritas, not potestas) of the Church (Contra\nepistulam fundamenti 5.6; Rist 1994: 245).\n5.4 Language and Signs\n\nAugustine\u2019s philosophy of language is both indebted to the\nStoic-influenced Hellenistic and Roman theories of grammar and highly\ninnovative (Rist 1994: 23\u201340; King 2014b). He follows the Stoics\nin distinguishing between the sound of a word, its meaning and the\nthing it signifies (De dialectica 5; De quantitate animae 66; cf. Sextus Empiricus, Adversus\nmathematicos 8.11\u201312 = 33B Long-Sedley), but he seems to\nhave been the first to interpret language as such as a system of signs\nand to integrate it into a general semiotics (Fuhrer 2018a: 1696; Cary\n2008b; Mayer 1969 and 1974). In his handbook of biblical exegesis and\nChristian rhetoric, De doctrina christiana (1.2;\n2.1\u20134), Augustine divides the world into \u201cthings\u201d\nand \u201csigns\u201d (i.e., things that, apart from being what they\nare, signify other things) and furthermore distinguishes between\n\u201cnatural\u201d or involuntary signs (e.g., smoke signifying\nfire) and voluntary or \u201cgiven\u201d signs (a distinction akin,\nbut not equivalent, to the older discussion about nature or convention\nas the origin of language). Language is defined as a system of given\nsigns by means of which the speaker signifies either things or her\nthoughts and emotions (Enchiridion 22). In the exegetical\nframework of De doctrina christiana, the \u201cthing\u201d\nsignified by the verbal signs of Scripture is God, the Supreme Being.\nAugustine therefore begins with a sketch of his theology and ethics\ncentered around the notions of love of God and neighbor before he sets out his biblical hermeneutics which,\nagain, posits love as the criterion of exegetical adequacy (Pollmann\n1996; Williams 2001). The words of the Bible are external signs\ndesigned to prompt us to the more inward phenomenon of love and,\nultimately, to God who is beyond all language and thought. This may be\ngeneralized to the principle that external\u2014verbal and\nnon-verbal\u2014signs operate on a lower ontological level than the\ninward and intelligible truth they attempt to signify and that they\nare superseded in true knowledge which is knowledge not of signs but\nof things. This holds not only for words, even the words of Scripture,\nbut also for the sacraments and for the Incarnation of Christ\n(Contra epistulam fundamenti 36.41). Augustine\u2019s most\nsustained discussion of language, the early dialogue De\nmagistro, asks how we learn things from words and relates\nlinguistic signification to the epistemology of illumination (Nawar\n2015). After a long discussion of how verbal signs signify things or\nstates of mind and how they relate to other signs, it turns out,\nrather surprisingly, that we do not learn things from signs at all\nbecause in order to understand the meaning of a sign we already have\nto be acquainted with the thing signified. This is ultimately a\nversion of Meno\u2019s paradox, and Augustine solves it by\nintroducing the metaphors of the inner teacher and of illumination,\ni.e., by means of an internalist theory of learning recognizable as a\nNeoplatonic interpretation of Platonic anamnesis (De magistro\n38\u201340).\n This does not mean that words are useless. They inform us about\nthings that are inaccessible to direct acquaintance and thus generate\ntrue belief; most importantly, they admonish us to\n\u201cconsult\u201d the inner teacher and to understand things by\nourselves (this, according to Augustine, is the whole point of the\nSocratic dialogue). This goes even for the acquisition of language\nitself: We understand the sign \u201cbird-catching\u201d, not simply\nby being shown a person engaged in that activity and being told that\nhe is signified by that name, but by observing him and figuring out\nfor ourselves what \u201cbird-catching\u201d means (ib. 32; on this\nand Wittgenstein\u2019s criticism of what he took to be\nAugustine\u2019s view of language acquisition, see Matthews 2005:\n23\u201333). In the later books of De trinitate and in the\nsermons on the Trinity, Augustine frequently refers to a phenomenon\ncalled \u201cinner word\u201d, which he uses to explain the relation\nof the inner-Trinitarian Word or Logos from the Prologue of John (John\n1:1) to Christ incarnate. Just as the spoken word signifies a concept\nthat we have formed within our mind and communicates it to others, so\nChrist incarnate signifies the divine Logos and admonishes and assists\nus to turn to it (cf. De trinitate 15.20; De doctrina\nchristiana 1.12; Sermon 119.7; 187.3). In De\ntrinitate Augustine expands this to a theory about how the inner\nword or concept is formed (14.10; 15.25; cf. 15.43). The inner word is\ngenerated when we actualize some latent or implicit knowledge that is\nstored in our memory. It is not a sign, nor of linguistic nature\n(Augustine insists that it is neither Latin nor Greek nor Hebrew), but\nrather seems to be a kind of a-temporal intellectual insight that\ntranscends language (cf. De catechizandis rudibus 3).\nProperly speaking, then, the theory of the inner word is not a\nlinguistic theory at all.\n6. Anthropology: God and the Soul; Soul and Body\n6.1 Soul as a Created Being\n\nLike most ancient philosophers, Augustine thinks that the human being\nis a compound of body and soul and that, within this compound, the\nsoul\u2014conceived as both the life-giving element and the center of\nconsciousness, perception and thought\u2014is, or ought to be, the\nruling part. The rational soul should control the sensual desires and\npassions; it can become wise if it turns to God, who is at the same\ntime the Supreme Being and the Supreme Good.\n In his Manichean phase, he conceived of both God and the soul as\nmaterial entities, the soul being in fact a portion of God that had\nfallen into the corporeal world where it remained a foreigner, even to\nits own body (De duabus animabus 1; Confessiones\n8.22). After his Platonist readings in Milan had provided him with the\nadequate philosophical means to think about immaterial, non-spatial\nreality (Confessiones 7.1\u20132; 7.16), he replaced this\nview, which he later represents as a rather crude dualism, with an\nontological hierarchy in which the soul, which is mutable in time but\nimmutable in space, occupies a middle position between God, who is\ntotally unchangeable immaterial being (cf. MacDonald 2014), and\nbodies, which are subject to temporal and spatial change\n(Letter 18.2). The soul is of divine origin and even god-like\n(De quantitate animae 2\u20133); it is not divine itself but\ncreated by God (the talk about divinity of the soul in the Cassiciacum\ndialogues seems to be a traditional Ciceronian element, cf. Cary 2000:\n77\u201389; for a Plotinian interpretation see O\u2019Connell 1968:\n112\u2013131). In De quantitate animae, Augustine broadly\nargues that the \u201cgreatness\u201d of the soul does not refer to\nspatial extension but to its vivifying, perceptive, rational and\ncontemplative powers that enable it to move close to God and are\ncompatible with and even presuppose immateriality (esp. ib.\n70\u201376; Brittain 2003). An early definition of soul as \u201ca\nrational substance fitted for rule over a body\u201d (ib. 22) echoes\nPlatonic views (cf. the definition of the human being as \u201ca\nrational soul with a body\u201d in In Iohannis evangelium\ntractatus 19.15; O\u2019Daly 1987: 54\u201360). Later on, when\nthe resurrection of the body becomes more important to him, Augustine\nemphasizes\u2014against Porphyry\u2019s alleged claim that in order\nto be happy, the soul must free itself from anything\ncorporeal\u2014that it is natural and even desirable for a soul to\ngovern a body (De Genesi ad litteram 12.35.68), but he\nnevertheless remains convinced that soul is an incorporeal and\nimmortal substance that can, in principle, exist independently of a\nbody. In the Soliloquia (2.24), following the tradition of\nPlato and of Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Disputations, he\nproposes a proof for the immortality of the soul which he expressly\nintroduces as an alternative to the final proof of the Phaedo\n(Soliloquia 2.23, cf. Phaedo 102d-103c). The proof\nis constructed from elements from Porphyry\u2019s Isagoge\nand his Commentary on Aristotle\u2019s Categories (rather\nelementary texts that Augustine would have encountered long before his\nPlatonic readings at Milan) and seems to be original with him (Tornau\n2017). It says that since truth is both eternal and in the soul as its\nsubject, it follows that soul, the subject of truth, is eternal too.\nThis is fallacious, because if truth is eternal independently of the\nsoul it cannot be in the soul as in its subject (i.e., as a property),\nand if it is a property of the soul, it cannot ensure its eternity. In\nthe incomplete draft of a third book of the Soliloquia\npreserved under the title De immortalitate animae, Augustine\ntherefore modifies the proof and argues that soul is immortal because\nof the inalienable causal presence of God (= Truth) in it. It turns\nout however that even if this version of the proof is successful, it\nonly demonstrates the soul\u2019s eternal existence as a (rational)\nsoul but not its eternal wisdom (De immortalitate animae 19;\nZum Brunn 1969: 17\u201341 [1988: 9\u201334]), in the hope of which the\ninterlocutors had set out to prove the immortality of the soul in the\nfirst place (Soliloquia 2.1). After De immortalitate\nanimae, Augustine never returned to his proof. But neither did he\ndisown it; as late as De trinitate (13.12), he endorses the\nPlatonic axiom that soul is by nature immortal and that its\nimmortality can, in principle, be proven by philosophical means. He\nalso sticks to his conviction that immortality is a necessary\ncondition of happiness but insists that it is not a sufficient\ncondition, given that immortality and misery are compatible (cf.\nDe civitate dei 9.15 on the misery of the wicked demons).\nTrue happiness will only be realized in the afterlife as a gift of\nGod\u2019s grace, when, thanks to the resurrection of the body, not\njust the soul but the human being as a whole will live forever.\nResurrection, however, is not susceptible of rational proof; it is a\npromise of God that must be believed on Scriptural authority (De\ntrinitate ib.).\n\nTogether with an essentially Platonic notion of the soul, Augustine\ninherits the classical problems of Platonic soul-body dualism. How can\nsoul fulfil its task of \u201cgoverning\u201d the body (cf. De quantitate\nanimae 22) if it is incorporeal itself? And how are\ncorporeal and psychic aspects related to each other in phenomena that\ninvolve both body and soul, especially if, like passions and desires,\nthese are morally relevant? These problems are further complicated by\nthe Platonic axiom that incorporeal entities, being ontologically\nprior to corporeal ones, cannot be causally affected by them.\nAugustine\u2019s solution is indebted to Plotinus\u2019 strategy of\nmaking the relation of the soul to the bodily affections an\nessentially cognitive one (O\u2019Daly 1987, 84\u201387;\nH\u00f6lscher 1986, ch. 2.2.1; Nash 1969, 39\u201359; Bermon 2001:\n239\u2013281). With Plotinus, he insists that sense perception is not\nan affection which the soul passively undergoes (as Stoic materialism\nwould have it, where sensory perception was interpreted as a kind of\nimprint in the soul) but its active awareness of affections undergone\nby the body (De quantitate animae 41; 48; De Genesi ad\nlitteram 7.14.20; Plotinus, Enneads I.4.2.3\u20134;\nBrittain 2002: 274\u2013282). In De quantitate animae, the\nframework of this theory is the general argument that the relation of\nsoul to body must be conceived of not in terms of space but of\n\u201cpower\u201d (see above). In De musica (6.11), this is\ndeveloped into the idea that sense perception is the soul\u2019s\nawareness of modifications of its own formative and vivifying\nactivities that result from its reacting to the external impulses\nundergone by the body. In addition to the usual five senses, Augustine\nidentifies a sensory faculty that relates the data of the senses to\neach other and judges them aesthetically (but not morally; De musica 6.5; 19);\nin De libero arbitrio (2.8\u201313) he calls this the\n\u201cinner sense\u201d (on the Aristotelian background cf.\nO\u2019Daly 1987: 102\u2013105).\n\nIn Neoplatonism it was disputed how soul, being immortal, immaterial\nand ontologically superior to body, came to be incorporated\nnevertheless. The basic options, present already in Plato\u2019s\ndialogues, were either that the disembodied soul had\n\u201cfallen\u201d into the corporeal world because of some error\n(as in the Phaedrus myth) or that it had been sent into the\ncosmos by God to impart life and order to it (as in the\nTimaeus; for harmonizing Neoplatonic exegeses, see Plotinus,\nEnneads IV.8, and Macrobius, Commentary on Cicero\u2019s\nSomnium Scipionis 1.10\u201314). Augustine addresses the issue\nin the horizon of his doctrine of creation and, in the period of the\nPelagian Controversy, of the debate about the transmission of original\nsin (see\n 9. Gender, Women and Sexuality).\n In De libero arbitrio (3.56\u201359), he distinguishes the\nthree options of creationism (God creates a new soul for every newborn\nbody), traducianism (the soul is transmitted from the parents to the\nchild like corporeal properties), and preexistence, which is\nsubdivided into the Platonic options of voluntary or god-sent descent.\nAfter 412 all these options come to the fore again (Letters\n143.5\u201311; 166; 190; and the treatise De anima et eius\norigine). Augustine discards none of them officially except for\nthe notion, wrongly associated with Origenism, which was considered a\nheresy at the time, that incorporation was a punishment for a sin\ncommitted by the pre-existent soul (De civitate dei 11.23).\nIn practice, he narrows the debate down to the alternative between\ncreationism and traducianism, which appear to have been the only\noptions taken seriously by his Christian contemporaries. Augustine\nrefused to take a stand till the end of his life, probably because\nneither option really suited his purposes (Rist 1994: 317\u2013320;\nO\u2019Connell 1987; Mendelson 1998): Creationism made original sin\nvery difficult to explain; traducianism was functional in this\nrespect, but it was a materialist and even biologist theory that ran\ncounter to Augustine\u2019s Platonism and was further compromised\nbecause it had been brought up by his African predecessor Tertullian\n(d. c. 220 CE), a Stoicizing corporealist who had ended his life as a\nheretic (Rist 1994: 123).\n6.2 The Human Mind as an Image of God\n\nAugustine deploys what we may call his philosophy of the mind most\nfully in his great work on Nicene Trinitarian theology, De\ntrinitate. Having removed apparent Scriptural obstacles to the\nequality and consubstantiality of the three divine persons (bks.\n1\u20134) and having set out the grammar, as it were, of adequate\nspeaking about the Trinity by distinguishing absolute and relative\npropositions about God and the three Persons (bks. 5\u20137; King\n2012), he turns to an analysis of the human mind as an image of God\n(bks. 8\u201315; Brachtendorf 2000; Ayres 2010; Bermon &\nO\u2019Daly (eds.) 2012). The basis for this move is, of course,\nGenesis 1:26\u201327. Augustine follows a long-standing Jewish and\nPatristic tradition, familiar to him from Ambrose, according to which\nthe biblical qualification of the human being as an image of God\nreferred not to the living body (a literalist reading vulnerable to\nthe Manichean charge of anthropomorphism, cf. Confessiones\n6.4) but to what is specifically human, i.e., the \u201cinner\nman\u201d (2 Corinthians 4:16, quoted, e.g., in De trinitate\n11.1) or the mind (mens). Assuming, in a Platonist manner,\nthat \u201cimage\u201d in this case does not merely mean an analogy\nbut a causal effect of the original that reflects the essential\nfeatures of the latter on a lower ontological level,\nhe scrutinizes the human mind for triadic structures that meet the\nNicene requirements of equality and consubstantiality and may thus\ngive a\u2014however faint\u2014understanding of the Triune God. The\ngeneral pattern of his argument is the Augustinian ascent from the\nexternal to the internal and from the senses to God; but since human\nreason is, whether by nature or due to its fallen state, hardly\ncapable of knowing God, Augustine this time is obliged to interrupt\nand re-start the ascent several times. The final book shows that the\nexercise of analyzing the human mind does have preparatory value for\nour thinking about the Trinity but does not yield insight into the\ndivine by being simply transferred to it (De trinitate\n15.10\u201311). The three elements Augustine discerns in all our\ncognitive acts from sense perception to theoretical reason or\ncontemplation are: [1] an object that is either external to the mind\n(as in sense perception) or internal to it, in which case it is an\nimage or a concept stored in our memory; [2] a cognitive faculty that\nmust be activated or \u201cformed\u201d by the object if cognition\nis to come about; [3] a voluntary or intentional element that makes\nthe cognitive faculty turn to its object so as to be actually formed\nby it. The last element ensures the active character of perception and\nintellection\n but also gives weight to the idea that we do not cognize an object\nunless we consciously direct our attention to it (MacDonald 2012b).\nThough this triadic pattern is operative on all levels of human\ncognition, Augustine contends that only the mind\u2019s intellectual\nself-knowledge on the level of contemplative reason (its \u201cmemory\nof itself, knowledge of itself and love of itself\u201d) qualifies as\nan image of God because only here are the three elements as closely\nrelated to each other as in the Nicene dogma and because they are as\ninalienable as the mind\u2019s immediate presence to itself (De\ntrinitate 14.19). This idea is carefully prepared in Book 10,\nwhich contains one of Augustine\u2019s most remarkable arguments for\nthe substantiality of the mind and its independence of the body\n(Str\u00f3\u017cy\u0144ski 2013; Brittain 2012a; Matthews 2005:\n43\u201352; Bermon 2001, 357\u2013404). Augustine begins by arguing\n(in a manner reminiscent of his cogito-like argument; see\n 5.1 Skepticism and Certainty)\n that the mind always already knows itself because it is always\npresent to and hence aware of itself. This pre-reflexive\nself-awareness is presupposed by every act of conscious cognition. If\nso, however, the Delphic command \u201cKnow thyself\u201d cannot\nmean that the mind is to become acquainted with itself as if it had\nbeen unknown to itself before, but rather that it must become\nconscious of what it knew about itself all along and distinguish it\nfrom what it does not know about itself. As the mind in its fallen\nstate is deeply immersed in sensible reality, it tends to forget what\nit really is and what it knows it is and confounds itself with the\nthings it attaches the greatest importance to, i.e., sensible objects\nthat give it pleasure. The result are materialist theories about the\nsoul, which thus derive from flawed morality (De trinitate\n10.11\u201312). If it follows the Delphic command, however, the mind\nwill realize that it knows with certainty that it exists, thinks,\nwills etc., whereas it can at best merely believe that it is air, fire\nor brain (ib. 10.13).\n And as the substance or essence of the mind cannot be anything other\nthan what it knows with certainty about itself, it follows that\nnothing material is essential to the mind and that its essence must be\nsought in its mental acts (ib. 10.16). Full self-knowledge is reached,\nthen, when the mind\u2019s inalienable self-awareness (se\nnosse, \u201cto be acquainted with oneself\u201d) is actualized\nto conscious \u201cself-thinking\u201d (se cogitare). How\nthis relates to the mind\u2019s pre-reflexive presence to itself is\nnot entirely clear (for problems of interpretation, see, e.g., Horn\n2012; Brittain 2012b), but Augustine seems to think that not only the\nmind\u2019s intellectual self-thinking but already its immediate\nself-awareness is triadically structured and an image of the Triune\nGod (De trinitate 14.7\u201314). Again, the ethical side of\nthe theory should not be overlooked. As a strong voluntary element is\npresent in and necessary for an act of cognition, what objects\n(imaginations, thoughts) we cognize is morally relevant and indicative\nof our loves and desires. And while the triadic structure of the mind\nis its very essence and hence inalienable, Augustine insists that the\nmind is created in the image of God, not because it is capable of\nself-knowledge, but because it has the potential to become wise, i.e.,\nto remember, know and love God, its creator (ib. 14.21\u201322).\n",
