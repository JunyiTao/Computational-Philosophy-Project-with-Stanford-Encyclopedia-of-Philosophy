    "main_text": "Influence on Philosophical Debates || Culture, Moral Psychology, and Moral Theory\n4.3 Culture, Moral Psychology, and Moral Theory\n\nEmpirical approaches to moral psychology have risen dramatically in\ninfluence and visibility in the last few decades (Nichols 2004; Prinz\n2007; Sinnott-Armstrong 2008a,b,c; Doris and the Moral Psychology\nGroup 2010; Doris, Stich, & Walmsley 2020; Doris, Stich, et al.\n2020; Alfano, Loeb, & Plakias 2018; Kelly & Setman 2020), but,\nas in other areas of cognitive science, practitioners continue to\nwrestle with the WEIRD challenge. Moral psychologists concerned with\ncultural and cognitive variation have added to the case that\nWesterners are outliers, and along many of the dimensions that appear\ndirectly relevant to moral theory (Graham et al. 2013, 2018).\nComparatively speaking, WEIRD people appear to be more\nindividualistic, guilt-ridden, impersonally prosocial, and accepting\nof impartial fairness norms, but less nepotistic, less loyal to\nfriends, and less likely to exhibit ingroup favoritism (J. Schulz et\nal. 2019; J. Henrich 2020; also see Davis & Kelly forthcoming for\na cultural perspective on the psychology of ingroup/outgroup biases).\nTheir moral judgments also appear to be more sensitive to the\nintentions and mental states of those whose behavior they are\nevaluating (Barrett, Bolyanatz, et al. 2016; McNamara et al. 2019;\nCurtin et al. 2020; Barrett & Saxe 2021; also see Willard &\nMcNamara 2019). This has led some philosophers to argue that the\nexplicit moral theories produced by Western moral philosophers,\nespecially those who rely mainly on their own intuitions, may be\nworrisomely parochial rather than expressions of panhuman or\ntranscendent moral truth (Flanagan 2016; Van Norden 2017; see also\n section 4.5\n below). Others have explored the ways in which research on the\nbiological and cultural origins of human moral psychology can help\ninform our understanding of the nature of morality itself (Joyce 2007;\nMachery & Mallon 2010; Stanford 2018). This perspective has led\nsome to argue that the category of morality, understood as a special\nsubdomain of normativity in general, is itself culturally parochial,\nan historically recent creation of Western philosophers (Machery 2018;\nalso see Stich 2018; Davis & Kelly 2018).\n\nOthers have drawn on empirically-oriented work on culture and\ncognition to inform more specific debates within moral theory, broadly\nconstrued. A wealth of empirical evidence has demonstrated cultural\ndifferences in behaviors, norms, and judgments concerned with\nreciprocity, fairness, and altruism (Sober & Wilson 1998; J.\nHenrich, Boyd, et al. 2004, 2005; Mathew, Boyd, & Van Veelen 2013;\nBaumard, Andr\u00e9, & Sperber 2013; Sterelny 2016).\nNaturalistic philosophers, in turn, have attempted to clarify the\nsignificance of the revealed variation, spelling out what it might\nmean for metaethical theorizing (Machery, Kelly, & Stich 2005;\nDoris & Plakias 2008) or how it might reflect on the range and\nmoral status of different forms of altruism and cooperation (Binmore\n2006; Zollman 2008; Clavien & Chapuisat 2013; Sterelny, Joyce, et\nal. 2013, Sterelny 2021; Curry 2016; Curry et al. forthcoming;\nPiccinini & Schulz 2019; Doris, Stich, & Walmsley 2020).\nSeveral philosophers have argued that there is non-trivial cultural\nvariation in the most basic components of morality, and as such that\nthere are unlikely to be many moral universals (Prinz 2008; A. Levy\n& Levy 2020; cf. Mikhail 2007, 2011).\n\nPhilosophers have long been interested in the genealogy of morals\n(Nietzsche 1887), and the subsequent rise of the fields of cognitive\nscience, Evolutionary Psychology, and empirical moral psychology has\nbrought with it a surge of interest in evolutionary debunking\narguments of morality. These have sparked a great deal of\nphilosophical debate, but it has been slow to seriously integrated\ncultural evolution or the contemporary cognitive science of culture\ninto the discussion (Kelly 2017). Critics have pointed out that\ndebunkers have rarely paid close attention to the details of\nscientific accounts of the evolution of morality, even though some of\nthe premises of their debunking arguments seem to rely on such\ndetails, including details about the cultural roots of many components\nof our moral minds (Cline 2015; Braddock 2021). Others have similarly\ntraced out how empirical inaccuracies in the premises of debunking\narguments undermine their conclusions (Machery & Mallon 2010;\nSterelny & Fraser 2017; A. Levy & Levy 2020).\n\nUnsurprisingly, moral realists who take a genealogical perspective see\nthings differently than the debunkers (Huemer 2016). Many philosophers\nhave been attracted to the idea that human cultures are in the midst\nof a significant historical trend in the direction of moral progress,\nas the last several centuries have witnessed a putative triumph of the\nopen society, a proliferation of broadly inclusive norms and values\nacross the globe (Jamieson 2002; Singer 1981 [2011]; Buchanan &\nPowell 2018; Gaus 2021; also see Pinker 2011, 2018). This wide and\nrelatively rapid spread of inclusivity is difficult for\nevolutionarily-inspired moral skeptics and anti-realists to account\nfor, the realist argues, because the extension of moral concern beyond\nmembers of a cultural ingroup seems to be maladaptive from an\nevolutionary perspective. Thus, realism seems better able to account\nfor the trend, explaining why inclusivist norms and values spread so\nquickly, and of why it only happened so recently.\n\nCritics have responded by arguing that there are viable\nalternative accounts for the trend, explanations that appeal to the\ninterplay between cultural capacities and cultural dynamics rather\nthan to the discovery and tracking of mind independent moral facts\n(Hopster 2020, also see Cofnas 2020). They also point out that it has\nbeen known since the establishment of the field of cultural evolution\nthat cultural evolutionary processes can and not infrequently do lead\nto biologically non-adaptive outcomes (R. Boyd & Richerson 1985),\nand that explanations that can account for the spread of packages of\nnorms and values, but do not require a commitment to moral realism,\nhave since grown in sophistication and empirical support (Richerson,\nBaldini, et al. 2016). Other critics have argued further that whether\nor not the realist\u2019s preferred explanation of the historical\ntrend is, indeed, the best explanation depends not only in the\nempirical details about the evolution and character of our moral and\ncultural capacities, but also on the details of history and how the\nspread of inclusivity actually occurred. They conclude the realist\nargument also requires deeper empirical engagement on a number of\nfronts to be convincing (Hassan 2019).\n",
