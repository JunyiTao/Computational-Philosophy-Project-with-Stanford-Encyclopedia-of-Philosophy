    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nBuddhist thought and practice are said to have emerged out of\nsustained practical commitment to discovering and nullifying the roots\nof human suffering. Canonical accounts of the liberation of\nBuddhism\u2019s founding figure, Siddhartha Gautama, make it clear\nthat becoming one awakened (buddha) to the origins and ending\nof suffering was not a process of rational distillation, but rather of\none of embodied conduct (see, e.g., Majjhima Nik\u0101ya 26).\nThe pivotal insights afforded by such conduct are, first, that all\nthings arise and pass away in dynamic interdependence\n(paticca-samupp\u0101da), and, secondly, that conflict and\nsuffering (dukkha) are relational distortions marking the\ntroubling inflection of interdependence as a function of ignorance\n(avijj\u0101); corporeal, perceptual, cognitive, and\nemotional habits (sankh\u0101ra); and craving forms of desire\n(tanh\u0101).\n\nChan Buddhism developed in China as a radical reaffirmation of the\nprimacy of embodied practice, the signal achievement of which came to\nbe envisioned as unwavering attentiveness and responsive virtuosity.\nIn the words of the founder of the Hongzhou lineage of Chan, Mazu\nDaoyi (709\u2013788), the fruition of Chan practice is a fluid\n\n\nharmony of body and mind that reaches out through all four\nlimbs\u2026benefiting what cannot be benefited and doing what\ncan\u2019t be done. (Xu zangjing, Vol. 119, 408b)\n\n\nBuilding on the prevalent Chinese Buddhist conviction that all beings\nhave/are Buddha-nature (fo-xing, \u4f5b\u6027), however,\npractice was not advocated in Chan as a means to\nenlightenment, but rather as the meaning of demonstrating it.\nIt is only in denial or ignorance of our own true nature that\nenlightenment can be regarded as something to seek, a destination at\nwhich we might one day arrive.\n\nIn sharp contrast with more scholastically-inclined schools of\nBuddhism, Chan did not see dispelling ignorance of our own true nature\nas something to be accomplished by studying canonical texts and\ncommentaries. On the contrary, in keeping with the Buddha\u2019s\nclaim that the wise \u201cdo not hang onto anything, anywhere\u201d\nand \u201cdo not enter into the mud of conceptual thinking\u201d\n(Sabhiya Sutta, Sutta Nip\u0101ta III.6), Chan came\nto insist that we cannot read or reason our way out of conflict,\ntrouble and suffering. And, in contrast with more ritually-defined\nschools of Buddhism, Chan also came to deny the merit of seeking help\nfrom supramundane sources. Dispelling ignorance of our own\nBuddha-nature does not involve cultivating or acquiring anything; we\nneed only end the relational paralysis that prevents us from\nconducting ourselves as enlightening beings. This does not\nrequire special conditions or implements. It does not require\nextensive study or training. It can be accomplished here and now, in\nthe midst of our own day-to-day lives.\n\nThis description might suggest that Chan originated in and actively\npropagated what could easily be viewed as anti-philosophical\nsentiments\u2014a view arguably supported by the apparent illogic of\nmany of the \u201cencounter dialogues\u201d that purported to record\nthe interactions of Chan masters and their students, and by the\nfour-fold phrasing that came to be used in Song dynasty China to\ncharacterize Chan distinctiveness:\n\n\na special transmission outside the scriptures (jiaowai\nbiechuan, \u6559\u5916\u5225\u50b3); not established upon\nwords and letters (buli wenzi,\n\u4e0d\u7acb\u6587\u5b57); directly pointing to the human\nheartmind (zhizhi renxin, \u76f4\u6307\u4eba\u5fc3);\nseeing nature and becoming a Buddha (jianxing chengfo,\n\u898b\u6027\u6210\u4f5b).\n\n\nIn both, there are appeals to the importance of immediacy, rather than\nreflection, and assertions about the limits of language and the\nultimate irrelevance of thinking to the realization of truth. Indeed,\nthe Sixth Chan Patriarch, Huineng (638\u2013713), famously proclaimed\nthat throughout Buddhist history, those transmitting the true Dharma\nestablished \u201cwithout-thinking\u201d (wunian,\n\u7121\u5ff5) as the core doctrine. For many of those involved in\nthe first generation of \u201cglobalizing\u201d Chan and Zen in the\nfirst half of the twentieth century, Chan\u2019s apparent\nanti-rationality was central to its promotion as a distinctively East\nAsian humanism and an antidote to heartless and humorless\nscientism.\n\nIt is, however, possible to view Chan differently. The body of Chan\nliterature is ironically perhaps the most voluminous of any in Chinese\nBuddhism. And while one would be hard-pressed to find therein\narguments of the kind that are now widely regarded as essential tools\nof the (especially analytic) philosophical trade, it is a body of\nliterature that I think can be very productively be engaged as\nenacting insights and inferences of considerable\nphilosophical significance\u2014a body of philosophical evidence\nrather than exposition and explanation.\n\nA major difficulty in attempting to engage philosophical perspectives\noriginating from beyond the horizons of European and American\ntraditions is the tendency to assume default status for Western\nphilosophical categories and questions. This leads, for example, to\nexpending considerable energy considering whether Confucian or\nBuddhist ethics are best seen as species of consequentialism,\ndeontology or virtue ethics, rather than trying to understand them as\nmuch as possible in their own terms. Doing so risks overwriting the\nphilosophical distinctiveness of so-called \u201cnon-Western\u201d\ntraditions and tacitly justifying the continued definition of academic\nphilosophy in terms of exclusively Western defaults. Being aware of\nthese risks, however, I think it is nevertheless possible to make\nprovisional use of Western categories to initiate exploration of\nphilosophical terrains shaped by very different forces than those with\nwhich we are most familiar. That, at least, is the approach taken here\nwith the aim of making it easier for students and teachers of\nphilosophy to find some places from which they might enter into\nproductive dialogue with Chan.\n",
