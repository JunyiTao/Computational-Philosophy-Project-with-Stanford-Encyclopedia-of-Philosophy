    "main_text": "Dissolving Descriptions || The maximality claim under pressure\n6.4 The maximality claim under pressure\n\nWe\u2019ve already put the uniqueness and existence claims of\ndescriptions under pressure. Can we do the same with the maximality\nclaim? Here it is difficult to find evidence one way or the other for\nthe case of singular definite descriptions, but earlier we saw that\nthe theory could be generalized \u00e0 la Sharvy,\nto plural descriptions, and in the plural case we could actually probe\nthe question of whether maximality holds.\n\nRecall from section 4.4 that on the Sharvy (1980) analysis of\ndescriptions we could generalize Russell\u2019s theory of\ndescriptions to plurals by arguing that \u2018the F (or\nFs) is (are) G\u2019 is equivalent to the\nfollowing,\n\n(32) \u2203x(Fx &\n\u2200y(Fy \u2192 y\u2264 x) &\nGx)\n\n\n(again, where F can be either a singular count noun (like\n\u2018dog\u2019), a plural count noun (like \u2018dogs\u2019) or a\nmass noun (like \u2018water\u2019), and the symbol\n\u2018\u2264\u2019 indicates a parthood relation.)\n\nOf interest to us at the moment is the fact that this analysis encodes\nthe maximality claim\u2014it says that all the Fs are\nGs. But is this analysis right? Arguably not. If one says the\nAmerican people are disappointed in Trump, it doesn\u2019t mean that\nall of them are. If my neighbor has 101 Dalmatians, I might complain\n\u2018the dogs are barking again\u2019, even if only some of them\nare barking (and it doesn\u2019t seem plausible to say that I am\nrestricting the domain of discourse to just the 20 or so dogs that are\nbarking). Likewise for definite mass terms; if I say that the bread in\nthe breadbox is moldy I am not saying that the bread is moldy through\nand through\u2014I\u2019m saying that some of it is. And if I say\nthat \u2018the dog is a loyal animal\u2019 I am not saying that all\nsubspecies of dogs are loyal. Arguably the maximality condition in\nSharvy\u2019s generalized theory of descriptions should be dropped\naltogether. (But see Brogaard (2007) and Bach (2000) for defenses of\nmaximality.)\n7. Descriptions through\u00a0the Lens of Linguistics\n\nThe importance of descriptions, and what is at stake in metaphysics,\nepistemology etc., have prompted some philosophers to dig deeper into\nthe actual linguistics of descriptions (or better, definite and\nindefinite determiners) and linguists have been happy to join in the\ninvestigation.\u00a0 What those joint investigations have shown is\nthat the structure of descriptions is not as straightforward as\nphilosophers often imagine.\u00a0 There have been several areas where\nthis has become evident.\n7.1 Descriptions as predicates\n\nAt the beginning of this article I noted that some uses of the\nexpressions \u2018an F\u2019 and \u2018the\nF\u2019 are argued to be predicational, rather than\nquantificational. So, for example, consider the following cases.\n\n\n(60) John is a lawyer.\n\n(61) John is the mayor of Pittsburgh.\n\n\nIt is not unusual to think of \u2018is a lawyer\u2019 and \u2018is\nthe mayor of Pittsburgh\u2019 as predicates. In the case of (60), we\nintuitively are not saying that there is a lawyer such that John is\nidentical to that lawyer. Indeed, as Williams (1983) observed, this\nappearance is even more pronounced if we consider cases like (62).\n\n(62) John is not a lawyer\n\n\n(62) does not seem to have the meaning that there is a lawyer such\nthat John is not identical to that lawyer. It is more natural to take\nan utterance of (62) as denying that John has a certain property.\n\nIf this is right, then the copula \u2018is\u2019 is really just the\n\u2018is\u2019 of predication and semantically dispensable\n(significantly, it routinely does not appear in many other languages\nunless it is needed to carry tense or other inflectional information).\nLikewise, we might say that the indefinite article \u2018a\u2019 is\nsemantically inert as well\u2014a mere \u201cgrace note\u201d in\nHigginbotham\u2019s (1987) terminology. In this vein, one widely held\nview, due to Kamp (1981) and Heim (1982), is that we could regard\nindefinite descriptions as expressions containing free variables which\nare bound by adverbs of quantification (in the sense of Lewis (1975))\ninterpreted as existentially quantified by the model theory, or\nperhaps bound by implicit existential closure operators (Diesing\n1992).\n\nFor linguists it is now standard to think of indefinite descriptions\nfollowing the copula as always being predicational, and it is a\nwidespread belief that definite descriptions following the copula are\noften predicational. Philosophers have also been attracted to this\nview. See, for example, Geach (1962; section 39), Wiggins (1965, 42\nff.), Kim (1970; 211 ff.), Wilson (1978), Smiley (1981),\u00a0Heim\n(1982) and Higginbotham (1987) among others). Does it follow that we\nmust admit two different kinds of descriptions (quantificational and\npredicational)? We saw that singular, plural, mass, and generic\ndescriptions can be unified; can we perform the same unification trick\nhere?\n\nFara (2001) pursued the possibility that all uses of definite\ndescriptions are predicational\u2014even descriptions in subject\nposition. The idea is that if I say \u2018The present King of France\nis bald\u2019, I am saying something like the following: some\nx is such that x is the unique present king of\nFrance and x is bald. The interesting riff here is the notion\nthat the uniqueness condition is built into the predicate. Extending\nthe Sharvy (1980) analysis of plural descriptions, we get the\nfollowing, where F is the set of all Fs, or the mass\nof all substance that is F (the vertical strokes before ad\nafter and after the expression indicate that we are talking about the\nsemantic value, or meaning, of the bordered expression):\n\n\n\n\n(63)\n||an F|| = F \n\n\u00a0\n||the F|| = {x: x \u2208 F\n& \u2200y(y\u2208F \u2192\ny\u2264x)}  \n\n\n\nBut again we might consider collapsing the distinction between\ndefinite and indefinite descriptions here, and say that there is a\nsingle rule that interprets all descriptions\u2014definite,\nindefinite, singular, plural, mass, or generic\u2014as predicates.\nWhen we supplement this with the rejection of the\nuniqueness/maximality clause we get this result:\n\n(63\u2032) ||the F/the Fs/an F/some\nFs|| = F\n\n\nIf this is right then the determiners \u2018a\u2019 and\n\u2018the\u2019 are both \u201cgrace notes\u201d not just in\nspecial positions, but across the board.\n\u00a07.2 Determiners decomposed\n\nNormally when we think about determiners we think about them as being\nfixed unary linguistic objects that have dedicated semantic roles, but\nis this so? Take the property of being a referring expression, for\nexample. We have spoken about whether descriptions are referring\nexpressions or not, but perhaps it is incorrect to suppose that there\nare dedicated referring expressions in natural language. Ahn (2019)\nargues that what is called on to refer can vary greatly in natural\nlanguage, and that what expressions are deployed in order to refer\ndepends on what else is available to do the job. She proposes a\n\u201ccompetition mechanism\u201d which determines which expression\nmight be deployed in order to refer to something.\u00a0 In some cases\nit might be a name, in some a demonstrative, in some a pronoun, and in\nsome a description.\u00a0 It depends on which expression wins the\ncompetition in that setting. What this means, if correct, is that the\njob of reference would not be associated with a single type of\nsyntactic object, but with a large array of syntactic objects. In a\nsimilar vein, Ludlow and \u017divanovic (2022) have suggested that what\ncounts as quantificational may not be a property of individual\nmorphological items, but is more likely a global structural\nproperty.\u00a0 In this instance, the definite and indefinite\ndeterminers play more of a role as structure builders and not as\nindividual operators. The kind of quantificational structure that\nemerges would be a function of the surrounding syntactic objects.\n\nIt could also be the case that syntactic objects like the definite and\nindefinite determiners may not even be as syntactically simple as they\nappear.\u00a0 As noted above, Schwarz (2009) observed that there are\nlanguages in which morphologically distinct words are used to express\nuniqueness and familiarity. Following Stake (2009) and others working\nin \u201cnanosyntax,\u201d this would create some pressure to say\nthat the definite determiner in English might not be a single\nfunctional head, but is \u201csmeared\u201d across a larger phrase\nstructure that has separate functional heads for expressing uniqueness\nand familiarity.\u00a0 The English\u00a0determiner ends up being\nexploded across the phrase structure.\n7.3 Determiners as case markers\n\nDeterminers are rare in the world\u2019s languages and are not\nuniversally employed in Indo-European languages. For example they are\nnot found in Slavic languages, with the exception of southern Slavic\nlanguages like Bulgarian. But perhaps this provides an opportunity to\ngain some insights into the nature of determiners. We can actually\nstudy how the Bulgarian determiner system evolved from other Slavic\nlanguages.\n\nOne interesting fact to observe here, is that as noted by Hewson\n(1972; 66\u201367), languages with articles and languages with robust\ncase morphology are typically in complementary distribution. Indeed,\nas languages evolve, their robust inflectional system gives way to\nstructure dependent language (Leiss (2000)). It is when the case\nsystem weakens that determiners begin to appear\u2013\u2013an idea\nthat is offered in Abraham (1997:29), Philippi (1997:63\u201364),\nSelig (1992), Ivan\u010dev 1988:105, and (Mayer 1988: 112). As\nMladenova (2007) puts it, \u201cthe morphology of the definite\narticle makes it possible to perpetuate case distinctions long after\nthey have been obliterated elsewhere.\u201d (But see also Mladenova\nfor subtleties in applying this idea to Bulgarian.) Could it be then\nthat determiners serve the purpose of case marking? Iliev (2019)\nargues that this is what is happening in\nBulgarian\u2013\u2013genitive case markers have been replace by\ndeterminers, which continue to\u00a0express a kind of possessive\nrelation.\n\nHow does this idea work?\u00a0We can illustrate with some examples\nfrom English.\n\n\n(64) The car went in the ditch.\n\n(65) I was such a terrible bowler that the ball went in the\ngutter.\n\n(66) The car needs gas.\n\n(67) The doctor told me to stop eating red meat.\n\n\nIt is easy to hear all of these examples as involving an implicit\npossessive operator.\n\n\n(64\u2032) The car went in the road\u2019s ditch.\n\n(65\u2032) I was such a terrible bowler that my ball went in\nmy lane\u2019s gutter.\n\n(66\u2032) Our car needs gas.\n\n(67\u2032) My doctor told me to stop eating red meat.\n\n\nExample (65) is particularly instructive in this regard. If I am an\nexceptionally terrible bowler I might toss the ball into the gutter of\nsomeone else\u2019s lane. In this case I might be more apt to say\n\u201cThe ball went in a gutter\u201d; saying that it went\nin the gutter doesn\u2019t quite seem to do justice to my failure as\na bowler. That is because when I say the ball went in the\ngutter it suggests that it at least ended up in my\ngutter.\n\nThe claim, however, is not that the definite determiner is functioning\nas a possessive. The hypothesis is that it is functioning as a\nmulti-purpose case marker, and when it is marking for genitive case,\npossessive meaning is one possible outcome. But genitive case can be\nput to other uses. For example, species names are routinely given in\nthe genitive case in Latin, and indeed it is a prescriptive rule about\nthe coining of a new species name that it be placed in genitive case.\nThe underlying deep motivation is presumably that species are part of\na genus, so that when one expresses a species name it is shorthand for\na more complete description. So, for example, when we say \u2018The\ntiger\u2019, we are offering up an abbreviation of something like\n\u2018tiger, species of genus panthera\u2019 (or more accurately,\n\u2018panthera tigris, of genus panther\u2019). Note the possessive\nnature of these constructions. In effect, we are saying this:\n\u2018species panthera tigris, belonging to the genus\npanthera\u2019.\n\nThis genitive case analysis perhaps sheds light on what is going on in\nthe array of facts offered by Abbott and Horn. Consider (46)\nagain.\n\n\n(46) So Lufthansa is a\u2014or even the\u2014German\nairline.\n\n\nAs observed earlier, (46) can be asserted even if there is more than\none German airline. One intriguing possibility here is that the stress\nis creating what is known as a superlative genitive, an\nexample from Latin being sanctum sanctorum (holy of holies).\nIn the case of (46), for example, we are saying Lufthansa is the most\nGerman airline of German airlines. This idea would require a story\ninvolving some movement and copying of the noun within the determiner\nphrase, but such a story would not be unheard of in contemporary work\non the structure of determiner phrases (see Larson (2014)).\n\nWhat is also intriguing about this line of inquiry is that it suggests\na new strategy for accounting for definiteness. It is not\npragmatically extruded from givenness (as suggested by Ludlow and\nSegal) but rather from whatever meaning the genitive case brings with\nit \u2013 often some notion of possession. For example, an appearance\nof a description of the form \u2018the dog\u2019 in a sentence might\nindicate something like \u2018dog of the event\u2019 or \u2018dog\nbearing some thematic role to the event\u2019. From this bit of\ninformation, the pragmatics might allow us infer that there is a\nunique dog.\n\nIt would not be fruitful to suggest that definite determiners\nalways play the role of case assignment, and they most\ncertainly cannot be cashed out as exclusively assigning genitive case.\nThe prospects for a unified explanation for determiner behavior seems\nremote. The evidence does suggest however, that definite determiners\ncan often play the role of supplying case, and this may go some way\ntowards explaining some of the most recalcitrant facts involving\ndescriptions.\n8. Conclusion\n\nA close study of the syntax and semantics of natural language suggests\nthat constructions of the form \u2018the F\u2019 and\n\u2018an F\u2019 are not only rare in natural languages,\nbut potentially misleading in languages like English. These\nexpressions really don\u2019t carry out the logical roles that\nRussell and subsequent authors have thought. However, Russell\u2019s\ncore insight remains intact: The critical question is whether the\nsentences in which they appear are quantificational or referential,\nand Russell may well be right about the critical cases here. That is,\nmany apparently referential constructions may in fact be\nquantificational. What Russell didn\u2019t see was that surface\ngrammar is more deceptive than even he realized. Elements like\n\u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 do not directly encode\nquantifiers or uniqueness clauses. The task for philosophers of\nlanguage now is the thorny task of figuring out what information they\ndo encode.",
