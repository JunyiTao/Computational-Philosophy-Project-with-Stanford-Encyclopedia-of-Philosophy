    "main_text": "Applications of Impossible Worlds || Propositional Content\n2.4 Propositional Content\n\nClosely connected to belief is the notion of propositional\ncontent. Within possible worlds semantics,\n propositions\n can be defined as functions from worlds to truth values, or as sets\nof worlds: a proposition is the set of worlds at which it is true. The\naccount is notoriously too coarse-grained (Barwise 1997). Intuitively\ndistinct impossible propositions (that swans are blue and not blue;\nthat Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem is false; that Charles is a married\nbachelor) all hold at precisely no possible worlds. And we have a dual\nproblem with (unrestrictedly) necessary propositions, which are all\nidentified with the set of all possible worlds. Treating propositions\nas set-theoretic constructions out of possible worlds leads to a very\ncoarse individuation of propositions, and because of this it has been\nsubject to seemingly devastating attacks, for instance, by Scott\nSoames 1987. However, impossible worlds allow for fine-grained\ndistinctions unavailable in standard possible worlds semantics. An\nimpossible proposition need not be equated with the empty set of\nworlds, for it may be a set which includes (only) impossible worlds.\nWe can have an impossible world \\(w_1\\) with impossibly coloured\nswans, a distinct impossible world \\(w_2\\) at which Fermat\u2019s\nLast Theorem is false, and a further impossible world \\(w_3\\) at which\nbachelors are married (but at which swans and Diophantine equations\nbehave correctly). Ripley (2012) argues that an account along these\nlines is a better strategy for addressing the coarse-grainedness\nproblem than resorting to\n structured propositions.\n\nOne other application of impossible worlds concerns\nperceptual impossibilities. When we see an Escher drawing or\na Penrose triangle, our experience has content. But that content is\nimpossible: such structures cannot be realised. The content of our\nexperience in such cases is naturally captured using impossible\nworlds. Splitting that content into smaller internally consistent\nparts would lose the essential feature of the whole. This issue is\nexplored in Mortensen 1997.\n",
