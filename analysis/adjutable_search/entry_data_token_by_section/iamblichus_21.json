    "main_text": "Ethics and Politics || Neoplatonism and politics\n7.1 Neoplatonism and politics\n\nNeoplatonism has often been regarded as a theological and\nother-worldly philosophy which assigns little (if any) significance to\npolitics and conceives of ethics merely as an ascetic path for the\nseparation of the soul from the body. This view has been questioned by\nD.J. O\u2019Meara and the significance of Neoplatonist political\nphilosophy is gaining increasing attention (see O\u2019Meara 2003;\nSchramm 2013). Iamblichus wrote a whole treatise On virtues,\nwhich is lost but whose content can be inferred from later sources. In\naddition to this, references to ethics and politics can be gathered\nfrom his extant works, especially the letters preserved by Johannes\nStobaeus (see DP-2009; TP-2010). It is a notable fact that some of\nIamblichus\u2019 interlocutors were influential figures in the\nfourth-century Roman empire, as is for example the case with Sopater\nof Apamea (see above,\n Section 1.1).\n It is somewhat difficult to clearly grasp Iamblichus\u2019 position\non these issues, since his treatise on virtues is lost, the later\ntestimonia are cursory and Iamblichus\u2019 letters are for the most\npart introductory and refrain from philosophical technicalities.\n\nThe extant evidence nonetheless suffices to outline some of\nIamblichus\u2019 views. Two letters focus on providence, fate and\nfree will against the background of Iamblichus\u2019 account of\ncausation, which sees the One as the principle of all being and the\nlower levels of reality as characterized by increasing degrees of\nmultiplicity (see the letters to Macedonius and Sopater: Johannes\nStobaeus I, 5, 17 and I, 5, 18). Iamblichus identifies the sphere of\noperation of fate with nature, i.e., \u201cthe immanent causal\nprinciple of the cosmos and that which immanently comprises the\ntotality of causes of the realm of generation\u201d (DP-2009: 35).\nThese views are reminiscent of the Stoic deterministic model of\ncausation, but Iamblichus also emphasises that the soul contains\nwithin itself a free and independent life and is able to emancipate\nitself from worldly influences (see Johannes Stobaeus I, 8, 45a).\n\nThis theological and metaphysical framework also grounds\nIamblichus\u2019 views about politics. In his letters he describes\nthe art of rulership as a kind of divinisation based on wisdom:\nthrough wisdom human beings are assimilated to gods and political\nrulership is an image of divine rulership in cosmos (see Johannes\nStobaeus III, 3, 26). Leadership is connected with philanthropy, which\nmakes the ruler mild, pleasant and approachable. Such views outline a\ncharacteristically theocratic conception. Elsewhere, however,\nIamblichus suggests a more modest view about rulership: he emphasises\nthe importance of law, which he sees as the genuine expression of a\ndivine model, the ruler being only its guardian (see Johannes Stobaeus\nIV, 5, 77). Such views can certainly be traced back to Plato: the\npassages about kingship can be set in parallel with Plato\u2019s\naccount of philosopher-kings in the Republic, whereas those\nabout the primacy of laws obviously recall Plato\u2019s political\nviews in the Laws. But parallels are abundant even outside\nthe Platonist tradition (e.g., in Stoicism and in Dio Chrysostomus, in\nthe Pseudo-Pythagorean writings) and the introductory tone of\nIamblichus\u2019 letters makes it difficult to isolate characteristic\nNeoplatonist elements. According to some interpreters, however,\nIamblichus\u2019 interest in politics is likely to be connected to\nhis views about the embodied soul. As O\u2019Meara remarks,\n\n\nHuman soul, alienated from its divine origins, finds its identity in\nits relation to body. As a consequence, the material, bodily aspects\nof the human condition were to be of much greater relevance for the\ndivinization of soul in later Neoplatonism than in Plotinus. (2003:\n39)\n\n\nIn fact, Neoplatonist philosophical ideas shaped not only\nIamblichus\u2019 views about politics, but also those of the Emperor\nJulian, whose Neoplatonist background (ultimately deriving from the\nIamblichean teaching of his masters at Pergamon) informs both his\naccount of law and rulership (see Julian\u2019s Letter to\nThemistius) and his theological foundation of the Roman Empire\n(Elm 2012).\n",
