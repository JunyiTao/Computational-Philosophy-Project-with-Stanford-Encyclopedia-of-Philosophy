Subordinate Ends, Principles and Maxims\n\nFrom early on in his utilitarian theorizing, Bentham understood that\nthe achievement of utilitarian objectives in practice required the\ntranslation of the utility principle into elements amenable to\nimplementation in ways that the philosophically abstract principle\nitself could not be. Concrete manifestations of happiness, for\nexample, could be found in personal security and reduced crime rates,\nenhanced health and declining death rates, broader opportunities for\neducation, the reduction of diseases caused by sewage pollution, and\nso on. The statistical measurement of these and other issues would\nprovide a solid basis for the dissection of existing law and the\ndevelopment of new law, but Bentham\u2019s thirst for such\ninformation was always well in advance of the available data. This\ndeficiency did not, however, prevent him from developing the\ntheoretical apparatus to direct the formulation of such laws.\n\nIn founding a system of law upon the principle of utility, Bentham\nannounced near the beginning of his career, \u201cI do no more than\nfound it upon a set of rules\u201d (UC lxix, 38). This was more than\nthe Humean observation that utility is embedded in customary rules\nthat have evolved over time. The maximization of utility required that\nthe jurist cast a \u201ccensorial\u201d eye on existing practices to\ntest their capacity to enhance the greatest happiness. Where the\njurist detects deficiencies, new rules and precepts must be developed\nthat demonstrably accord with the utility principle. In\nBentham\u2019s hands this took the form of a multitude of subordinate\nor secondary ends, principles and maxims designed to give practical\ndirection to the utility principle in each and every aspect of the\nlaw. The greatest happiness principle sets the over-arching objective\nand is the critical standard against which existing practices are to\nbe judged. As such, it stands ever ready to be summoned forth whenever\nnew guidelines are needed, subordinate ends conflict, or existing laws\nrequire amendment, refinement, or further elaboration. However, in\npractice it is the secondary elements of the theory that do the work\nof producing beneficial outcomes. In this way, they give practical\nconcreteness to the philosophically abstract end of the greatest\nhappiness.\n",
