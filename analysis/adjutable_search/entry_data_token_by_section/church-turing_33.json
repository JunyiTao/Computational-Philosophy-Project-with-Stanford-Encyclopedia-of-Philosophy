(Wolfram 1985: 735)\n\n\nDeutsch (who laid the foundations of quantum computation)\nindependently stated a similar thesis, again in 1985, and also\ndescribed it as a \u201cphysical version\u201d of the Church-Turing\nthesis:\n\n\nI can now state the physical version of the Church-Turing principle:\n\u201cEvery finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly\nsimulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite\nmeans\u201d. This formulation is both better defined and more\nphysical than Turing\u2019s own way of expressing it. (Deutsch 1985:\n99)\n\n\nThis thesis is certainly \u201cmore physical\u201d than\nTuring\u2019s thesis. It is, however, a completely different\nclaim from Turing\u2019s own, so it is potentially confusing to\npresent it as a \u201cbetter defined\u201d version of what Turing\nsaid. As already emphasized, Turing was talking about effective\nmethods, whereas the theses presented by Deutsch and Wolfram\nconcern all (finitely realizable) physical systems\u2014no matter\nwhether or not the system\u2019s activity is effective.\n\nIn the wake of this early work by Deutsch and Wolfram, the phrases\n\u201cphysical form of the Church-Turing thesis\u201d,\n\u201cphysical version of the Church-Turing thesis\u201d\u2014and\neven \u201cthe physical Church-Turing\nthesis\u201d\u2014are now quite common in the current literature.\nHowever, such terms are probably better avoided, since these physical\ntheses are very distant from Turing\u2019s thesis and Church\u2019s\nthesis.\n\nIn his 1985 paper, Deutsch went on to point out that if the\ndescription \u201ca universal model computing machine operating by\nfinite means\u201d is replaced in his physical thesis by \u201ca\nuniversal Turing machine\u201d, then the result:\n\n\nEvery finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated\nby a universal Turing machine\n\n\nis not true. His reason for saying so is the point discussed at the\nend of\n Section 6.3,\n concerning non-discrete physical systems. Deutsch argued that a\nuniversal Turing machine \u201ccannot perfectly simulate any\nclassical dynamical system\u201d, since \u201c[o]wing to the\ncontinuity of classical dynamics, the possible states of a classical\nsystem necessarily form a continuum\u201d, whereas the universal\nTuring machine is a discrete system (Deutsch 1985: 100). Deutsch then\nwent on to introduce the important concept of a universal quantum\ncomputer, saying (but without proof) that this is \u201ccapable of\nperfectly simulating every finite, realizable physical system\u201d\n(1985: 102).\n\nThe following formulation differs in its details from both\nWolfram\u2019s and Deutsch\u2019s theses, but arguably captures the\nspirit of both. In view of the Deutsch-Gandy point about continuous\nsystems, the idea of perfect simulation is replaced by the concept of\nsimulation to any desired degree of accuracy:\n\n\nDeutsch-Wolfram Thesis:\n\nEvery finite physical system can be simulated to any specified degree\nof accuracy by a universal Turing machine. (Copeland & Shagrir\n2019)\n\n\nRelated physical theses were advanced by Earman 1986, Pour-El and\nRichards 1989, Pitowsky 1990, Blum et al. 1998, and others. The\nDeutsch-Wolfram thesis is closely related to Gandy\u2019s Thesis M,\nand to the weak maximality thesis\n (Section 5.4).\n In fact the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis entails the latter (but not vice\nversa, since the maximality thesis concerns only machines,\nwhereas the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis concerns the behavior of\nall finite physical systems\u2014although any who think that\nevery finite physical system is a computing machine will disagree; see\ne.g., Pitowsky 1990).\n\nIs the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis true? This is an open question (Copeland\n& Shagrir 2020)\u2014so too for the weak maximality thesis. One\nfocus of debate is whether physical randomness, if it exists,\nfalsifies these theses (Calude et al. 2010; Calude & Svozil 2008;\nCopeland 2000). But even in the case of non-random systems,\nspeculation stretches back over at least six decades that there may be\nreal physical processes (and so, potentially, machine-operations)\nwhose behavior is neither computable nor approximable by a universal\nTuring machine. See, for example, Scarpellini 1963, Pour-El and\nRichards 1979, 1981, Kreisel 1967, 1974, 1982, Geroch and Hartle 1986,\nPitowsky 1990, Stannett 1990, da Costa and Doria 1991, 1994, Hogarth\n1994, Siegelmann and Sontag 1994, Copeland and Sylvan 1999, Kieu 2004,\n2006 (see Other Internet Resources), Penrose 1994, 2011, 2016.\n\nTo select, by way of example, just one paper from this list: Pour-El\nand Richards showed in their 1981 article that a system evolving from\ncomputable initial conditions in accordance with the familiar\nthree-dimensional wave equation is capable of exhibiting behavior that\nfalsifies the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis. However, now as then, it is an\nopen question whether these initial conditions are physically\npossible.\n6.4.2 The \u201cGandy argument\u201d\n\nGandy (1980) gave a profound discussion of whether there could be\ndeterministic, discrete systems whose behavior cannot be calculated by\na universal Turing machine. The now famous \u201cGandy\nargument\u201d aims to show that, given certain reasonable physical\nassumptions, the behavior of every discrete deterministic\nmechanism is calculable by Turing machine. In some respects, the Gandy\nargument resembles and extends Turing\u2019s argument I, and Gandy\nregarded it as an improved and more general alternative to\nTuring\u2019s I (1980: 145). He emphasized that (unlike\nTuring\u2019s argument), his argument takes \u201cparallel working\ninto account\u201d (1980: 124\u20135); and it is this that accounts\nfor much of the additional complexity of Gandy\u2019s analysis as\ncompared to Turing\u2019s.\n\nGandy viewed the conclusion of his argument (that the behavior of\nevery discrete deterministic mechanism is calculable by Turing\nmachine) as relatively a priori, provable on the basis of a\nset-theoretic derivation that makes very general physical assumptions\n(namely, the four axioms mentioned in\n Section 3.4).\n These assumptions include, for instance, a lower bound on the\ndimensions of a mechanism\u2019s components, and an upper bound on\nthe speed of propagation of effects and signals. (The argument aims to\ncover only mechanisms obeying the principles of Relativity.) Gandy\nexpressed his various physical assumptions set-theoretically, by means\nof precise axioms, which he called Principles I \u2013 IV. Principle\nIII, for example, captures the idea that there is a bound on the\nnumber of types of basic parts (atoms) from which the states of the\nmachine are uniquely assembled; and Principle IV\u2014which Gandy\ncalled the \u201cprinciple of local causation\u201d\u2014captures\nthe idea that each state-transition must be determined by the\nlocal environments of the parts of the mechanism that change\nin the transition.\n\nGandy was very clear that his argument does not apply to continuous\nsystems\u2014analogue machines, as he called them\u2014and\nnon-relativistic systems. (Extracts from unpublished work by Gandy, in\nwhich he attempted to develop a companion argument for analogue\nmachines, are included in Copeland & Shagrir 2007.) However, the\nscope of the Gandy argument is also limited in other ways, not noted\nby Gandy himself. For example, some asynchronous algorithms fall\noutside the scope of Gandy\u2019s principles (Gurevich 2012; Copeland\n& Shagrir 2007). Gurevich concludes that Gandy has not shown\n\u201cthat his axioms are satisfied by all discrete mechanical\ndevices\u201d, and Shagrir says there is no \u201cbasis for claiming\nthat Gandy characterized finite machine computation\u201d (Gurevich\n2012: 36, Shagrir 2002: 234). It will be useful to give some examples\nof discrete deterministic systems that, in one way or another, evade\nGandy\u2019s conclusion that the behavior of every such system is\ncalculable by Turing machine.\n\nFirst, it is relatively trivial that mechanisms satisfying\nGandy\u2019s four principles may nevertheless produce uncomputable\noutput from computable input if embedded in a universe whose physical\nlaws have Turing-uncomputability built into them, e.g., via a temporal\nvariable (Copeland & Shagrir 2007). Moreover, some asynchronous\nalgorithms fall outside the scope of Gandy\u2019s principles\n(Gurevich 2012; Copeland & Shagrir 2007). Second, certain\n(notional) discrete deterministic \u201crelativistic computers\u201d\nalso fall outside the scope of Gandy\u2019s principles. Relativistic\ncomputers were described in a 1987 lecture by Pitowsky (Pitowsky\n1990), and in Hogarth 1994 and Etesi & N\u00e9meti 2002. The\nidea is outlined in the entry on\n computation in physical systems;\n for further discussion see Shagrir and Pitowsky 2003, Copeland and\nShagrir 2020.\n\nThe N\u00e9meti relativistic computer makes use of gravitational\ntime-dilation effects in order to compute (in a broad sense) a\nfunction that provably cannot be computed by a universal Turing\nmachine (e.g., the halting function). N\u00e9meti and his colleagues\nemphasize that the N\u00e9meti computer is \u201cnot in conflict\nwith presently accepted scientific principles\u201d and that, in\nparticular, \u201cthe principles of quantum mechanics are not\nviolated\u201d. They suggest moreover that humans might \u201ceven\nbuild\u201d a relativistic computer \u201csometime in the\nfuture\u201d (Andr\u00e9ka, N\u00e9meti, & N\u00e9meti\n2009: 501).\n\nAccording to Gandy,\n\n\u201cA discrete deterministic mechanical device satisfies\nprinciples I-IV\u201d (he called this \u201cThesis P\u201d; Gandy\n1980: 126), and\n\u201cWhat can be calculated by a device satisfying principles\nI-IV is computable\u201d (he labelled this\n\u201cTheorem\u201d).\n\n\n1 and 2 together yield: What can be calculated by a discrete\ndeterministic mechanical device is (Turing-machine)\ncomputable.\n\nHowever, the N\u00e9meti computer is a discrete, deterministic\nmechanical device, and yet is able to calculate functions that are not\nTuring-machine computable. That is to say, relativistic computers are\ncounterexamples to Gandy\u2019s Thesis P. In brief, the reason for\nthis is that the sense of \u201cdeterministic\u201d implicitly\nspecified in Gandy\u2019s Principles\n(\u201cGandy-deterministic\u201d) is narrower than the intuitive\nsense of \u201cdeterministic\u201d, where a deterministic system is\none obeying laws that involve no randomness or stochasticity.\nRelativistic computers are deterministic but not Gandy-deterministic.\n(For a fuller discussion, see Copeland, Shagrir, & Sprevak\n2018.)\n\nIn conclusion, Gandy\u2019s analysis has made a considerable\ncontribution to the current understanding of machine computation. But,\nimportant and illuminating though the Gandy argument is, it certainly\ndoes not settle the question whether the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis is\ntrue.\n6.4.3 Quantum effects and the \u201cTotal\u201d thesis\n\nThere is a stronger form of the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis,\n dubbed the \u201cTotal thesis\u201d in Copeland and Shagrir\n2019.\n\n\nThe Total Thesis:\n\nEvery physical aspect of the behavior of any physical system can be\ncalculated (to any specified degree of accuracy) by a universal Turing\nmachine.\n\n\nLogically, the Total thesis is counter-exampled by the universal\nTuring machine itself (assuming that the universal machine, with its\nindefinitely long tape, is at least a notional physical system; see\nCopeland & Shagrir 2020 for discussion of this assumption). This\nis because there is no algorithm for calculating whether a universal\nTuring machine halts on every given input\u2014i.e., there is no\nalgorithm for calculating that aspect of the machine\u2019s behavior.\nThe question remains, however, whether the Total thesis is infringed\nby any systems that are \u201cmore physical\u201d than the universal\nmachine. (Notice that such systems, if any exist, do not necessarily\nalso infringe the Deutsch-Wolfram thesis, since it is possible that,\neven though answers to certain physical questions about the system are\nuncomputable, the system is nevertheless able to be simulated by a\nTuring machine.)\n\nInterestingly, recent work in condensed matter quantum physics\nindicates that\u2014possibly\u2014quantum many-body systems could\ninfringe the Total thesis. In 2012, Eisert, M\u00fcller and Gogolin\nestablished the surprising result that\n\n\nthe very natural physical problem of determining whether certain\noutcome sequences cannot occur in repeated quantum measurements is\nundecidable, even though the same problem for classical measurements\nis readily decidable. (Eisert, M\u00fcller & Gogolin 2012:\n260501.1)\n\n\nThis was a curtain-raiser to a series of dramatic results about the\nuncomputability of quantum phase transitions, by Cubitt and his group\n(Cubitt, Perez-Garcia, & Wolf 2015; Bausch, Cubitt, Lucia, &\nPerez-Garcia 2020; Bausch, Cubitt, & Watson 2021). These results\nconcern the \u201cspectral gap\u201d, an important determinant of\nthe properties of a substance. A quantum many-body system is said to\nbe \u201cgapped\u201d if the system has a well-defined next least\nenergy-level above the system\u2019s ground energy-level, and is said\nto be \u201cgapless\u201d otherwise (i.e., if the energy spectrum is\ncontinuous). The \u201cspectral gap problem\u201d is the problem of\ndetermining whether a given many-body system is gapped or gapless.\n\nThe uncomputability results of Cubitt et al. stem from their discovery\nthat the halting problem can be encoded in the spectral gap problem.\nDeciding whether a model system of the type they have studied is\ngapped or gapless, given a description of the local interactions, is\n\u201cat least as hard as solving the Halting Problem\u201d (Bausch,\nCubitt, & Watson 2021: 2). Moreover, this is not just a case of\nuncomputability in, uncomputability out. Uncomputability\narises even though the initial conditions are computable (as with the\nnotional system described in Pour-El and Richards 1981, mentioned in\n Section 6.4.1).\n Cubitt et al. emphasize:\n\n\nthe phase diagram is uncomputable even for computable (or\neven algebraic) values of its parameter \\(\\phi\\). Indeed, it is\nuncomputable at a countably-infinite set of computable (or algebraic)\nvalues of \\(\\phi\\). (Bausch, Cubitt, & Watson 2019: 8)\n\n\nHowever, Cubitt admits that the models used in the proofs are somewhat\nartificial:\n\n\nWhether the results can be extended to more natural models is yet to\nbe determined. (Cubitt, Perez-Garcia & Wolf 2015: 211)\n\n\nIn short, it is an open\u2014and fascinating\u2014question whether\nthere are realistic physical systems that fail to satisfy the Total\nthesis.\n7. Some Key Remarks by Turing and Church\n7.1 Turing machines\n\nTuring prefaced his first description of a Turing machine with the\nwords:\n\n\nWe may compare a man in the process of computing a \u2026 number to\na machine. (Turing 1936 [2004: 59])\n\n\nThe Turing machine is a model, idealized in certain respects, of a\nhuman being calculating in accordance with an effective\nmethod.\n\nWittgenstein put this point in a striking way:\n\n\nTuring\u2019s \u201cMachines\u201d. These machines are\nhumans who calculate. (Wittgenstein 1947 [1980: 1096])\n\n\nIt is a point that Turing was to emphasize, in various forms, again\nand again. For example:\n\n\nA man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict\ndiscipline, is in effect a universal machine. (Turing 1948 [2004:\n416])\n\n\nIn order to understand Turing\u2019s \u201cOn Computable\nNumbers\u201d and later texts, it is essential to keep in mind that\nwhen he used the words \u201ccomputer\u201d,\n\u201ccomputable\u201d and \u201ccomputation\u201d, he employed\nthem not in their modern sense as pertaining to machines, but as\npertaining to human calculators. For example:\n\n\nComputers always spend just as long in writing numbers down and\ndeciding what to do next as they do in actual multiplications, and it\nis just the same with ACE [the Automatic Computing Engine] \u2026\n[T]he ACE will do the work of about 10,000 computers \u2026\nComputers will still be employed on small calculations \u2026\n(Turing 1947 [2004: 387, 391])\n\n\nTuring\u2019s ACE, an early electronic stored-program digital\ncomputer, was built at the National Physical Laboratory, London; a\npilot version\u2014at the time the fastest functioning computer in\nthe world\u2014first ran in 1950, and a commercial model, the DEUCE,\nwas marketed very successfully by English Electric.\n7.2 Human computation and machine computation\n\nThe electronic stored-program digital computers for which the\nuniversal Turing machine was a blueprint are, each of them,\ncomputationally equivalent to a Turing machine, and so they too are,\nin a sense, models of human beings engaged in computation. Turing\nchose to emphasize this when explaining these electronic machines in a\nmanner suitable for an audience of uninitiates:\n\n\nThe idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that\nthese machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be\ndone by a human computer. (Turing 1950a [2004: 444])\n\n\nHe made the point a little more precisely in the technical document\ncontaining his design for the ACE:\n\n\nThe class of problems capable of solution by the machine [the ACE] can\nbe defined fairly specifically. They are [a subset of] those problems\nwhich can be solved by human clerical labour, working to fixed rules,\nand without understanding. (Turing 1945 [2005: 386])\n\n\nTuring went on to characterize this subset in terms of the\namount of paper and time available to the human clerk.\n\nIt was presumably because he considered the point to be essential for\nunderstanding the nature of the new electronic machines that he chose\nto begin his Programmers\u2019 Handbook for Manchester Electronic\nComputer Mark II with this explanation:\n\n\nElectronic computers are intended to carry out any definite rule of\nthumb process which could have been done by a human operator working\nin a disciplined but unintelligent manner. (Turing c1950:\n1)\n\n\nIt was not some deficiency of imagination that led Turing to model his\nL.C.M.s on what could be achieved by a human computer. The\npurpose for which he invented the Turing machine demanded it. The\nEntscheidungsproblem is the problem of finding a humanly\nexecutable method of a certain sort, and, as was explained\nearlier, Turing\u2019s aim was to show that there is no such method\nin the case of the full first-order predicate calculus.\n7.3 Church and the human computer\n\nTuring placed the human computer center stage in his 1936 paper. Not\nso Church. Church did not mention computation or human computers\nexplicitly in either of his two groundbreaking papers on the\nEntscheidungsproblem (Church 1936a,b). He spoke of \u201ceffective\ncalculability\u201d, taking it for granted his readers would\nunderstand this term to be referring to human calculation. He\nalso used the term \u201ceffective method\u201d, again taking it for\ngranted that readers would understand him to be speaking of a humanly\nexecutable method.\n\nChurch also used the term \u201calgorithm\u201d, saying\n\n\nIt is clear that for any recursive function of positive integers there\nexists an algorithm using which any required particular value of the\nfunction can be effectively calculated. (Church 1936a: 351)\n\n\nHe said further that the notion of effective calculability could be\nspelled out as follows:\n\n\nby defining a function to be effectively calculable if there exists an\nalgorithm for the calculation of its values. (Church 1936a: 358)\n\n\nIt was in Church\u2019s review of Turing\u2019s 1936 paper that he\nbrought the human computer out of the shadows. He wrote:\n\n\n[A] human calculator, provided with pencil and paper and explicit\ninstructions, can be regarded as a kind of Turing machine. It is thus\nimmediately clear that computability, so defined [i.e., computability\nby a Turing machine], can be identified with (especially, is no less\ngeneral than) the notion of effectiveness as it appears in certain\nmathematical problems \u2026 and in general any problem which\nconcerns the discovery of an algorithm. (Church 1937a: 43)\n\n7.4 Turing\u2019s use of \u201cmachine\u201d\n\nIt is important to note that, when Turing used the word\n\u201cmachine\u201d, he often meant not machine-in-general but, as\nwe would now say, Turing machine. At one point he explicitly drew\nattention to this usage:\n\n\nThe expression \u201cmachine process\u201d of course means one which\ncould be carried out by the type of machine I was considering [in\n\u201cOn Computable Numbers\u201d]. (Turing 1947 [2004:\n378\u20139])\n\n\nThus when, a few pages later, Turing asserted that \u201cmachine\nprocesses and rule of thumb processes are synonymous\u201d (1947\n[2004: 383]), he is to be understood as advancing the Church-Turing\nthesis (and its converse), not a version of the maximality thesis.\nUnless his intended usage is borne in mind, misunderstanding could\nensue. Especially liable to mislead are statements like the following,\nwhich a casual reader might mistake for a formulation of the\nmaximality thesis:\n\n\nThe importance of the universal machine is clear. We do not need to\nhave an infinity of different machines doing different jobs. A single\none will suffice. The engineering problem of producing various\nmachines for various jobs is replaced by the office work of\n\u201cprogramming\u201d the universal machine to do these jobs.\n(Turing 1948 [2004: 414])\n\n\nIn context it is perfectly clear that these remarks concern machines\nequivalent to Turing machines; the passage is embedded in a discussion\nof L.C.M.s.\n\nWhether or not Turing would, if queried, have assented to the weak\nmaximality thesis is unknown. There is certainly no textual evidence\nin favor of the view that he did so assent. The same is true of the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n and its cognates: there is no textual evidence that Turing would have\nassented to any such thesis.\n7.5 Church\u2019s version of Turing\u2019s thesis\n\nInterestingly, the summary of Turing\u2019s account of computability\ngiven by Church in his 1937 review was not entirely correct. Church\nsaid:\n\n\nThe author [Turing] proposes as a criterion that an infinite sequence\nof digits 0 and 1 be \u201ccomputable\u201d that it shall be\npossible to devise a computing machine, occupying a finite space and\nwith working parts of a finite size, which will write down the\nsequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for a\nsufficiently long time. (Church 1937a: 42)\n\n\nHowever, there was no requirement proposed in Turing\u2019s 1936\npaper that Turing machines occupy \u201ca finite space\u201d or have\n\u201cworking parts of a finite size\u201d. Nor did Turing couch\nmatters in terms of the machine\u2019s writing down \u201cany\ndesired number of terms\u201d of the sequence, \u201cif allowed to\nrun for a sufficiently long time\u201d. Turing said, on the contrary,\nthat a sequence is \u201ccomputable if it can be computed by a\ncircle-free machine\u201d (Turing 1936 [2004: 61]); where a machine\nis circle-free if it is not one that\n\n\nnever writes down more than a finite number of symbols [0s and 1s].\n(Turing 1936 [2004: 60])\n\n\nIn consequence, Church\u2019s version of Turing\u2019s thesis is\nsubtly different from Turing\u2019s own:\n\n\nChurch\u2019s Turing\u2019s thesis:\n\nAn infinite sequence of digits is \u201ccomputable\u201d if (and\nonly if) it is possible to devise a computing machine, occupying a\nfinite space and with working parts of a finite size, that will write\ndown the sequence to any desired number of terms if allowed to run for\na sufficiently long time.\n\n\nIn so far as Church includes these three finiteness requirements\n(i.e., that the machine occupy a finite space, have finite-sized\nparts, and produce finite numbers of digits), his version of\nTuring\u2019s thesis can perhaps be said to be \u201cmore\nphysical\u201d than any of Turing\u2019s formulations of the thesis.\nChurch\u2019s finiteness requirements are in some respects\nreminiscent of Gandy\u2019s idea that the states of a discrete\ndeterministic calculating machine must be built up iteratively from a\nbounded number of types of basic components, the dimensions of which\nhave a lower bound (see\n Section 6.4.2).\n Although, as explained there, Gandy imposes further requirements on a\ndiscrete deterministic calculating machine, and these go far beyond\nChurch\u2019s finiteness requirements.\n\nNotwithstanding Church\u2019s efforts to inject additional physical\nrealism into the concept of a Turing machine, it is\u2014as in\nTuring\u2019s case\u2014unknown whether Church would, if queried,\nhave assented to the\n Deutsch-Wolfram thesis\n or any cognate thesis. There seems to be no textual evidence either\nway. Church was simply silent about such matters.",
