    "main_text": "\n\nMany philosophers maintain there is a significant difference between\nprimary and secondary qualities but disagree about its foundation. It\nmay be plausible that we perceive things as having a small number of\nbasic qualities which are determinates or degrees of the following:\nsize, figure, extension, duration, motion, position, color, taste,\nodor, sound, heat, coldness, and tactual qualities such as hardness,\nsoftness, roughness and smoothness. The first six (to which solidity\nand number are sometimes added) are called \u201cprimary\u201d;\nroughly speaking, they are said to be real objective properties of\nobjects and to be distinctly known. The remaining, called\n\u201csecondary\u201d, are said to be in some\nway\u2014metaphysically, epistemically,\nlinguistically\u2014derivative, less than fully real, or otherwise\nmetaphysically feeble; or misleading, subjective, ambiguous, or\notherwise not perspicuous. The lists map the extension of the division\nand the doctrine explains its basis.\n\nThe distinction presupposes that things we perceive by our senses are\nmind-independent material objects, or substances, which possess\nqualities and quantities, have relations, and take part in events.\nBases for the distinction come from the age-old attempt to learn what\nthere is in the natural world, manage it for our purposes, and attain\ntheoretical explanatory knowledge about it. They are located in the\nmaterial and structural aspects of the universe, the psychology of\nsense perception, and their intersection. John Locke\u2019s famous\ndistinction has notably different variants in the seventeenth century\nand all of them are disputed. Other versions are advanced and debated\nthrough the eighteenth century. Although the distinction ceases to be\nof much interest during the heyday of idealism, it attracts attention\nduring the mid to late twentieth century. More recently, questions\nabout color that can be traced to the seventeenth century have come to\nthe fore. (See M. Wilson 1992 on the early modern inheritance of\ntwentieth century debates. See also the entries on\n color,\n auditory perception, and\n touch.)\n\nInstead of trying to establish a canonical doctrine of primary and\nsecondary qualities, it is better to recognize the close temporal and\nconceptual connection between seventeenth century variants of the\ndistinction and the innovative non-Aristotelian theories of matter and\nsense perception inspired by Kepler\u2019s amendments to the\nCopernican astronomy. This article considers the seventeenth and\neighteenth century versions which have most influenced recent analytic\nphilosophy. There are two reasons for this restriction. First, the\nhistorical debates are nuanced and subject to several interpretations;\ncomparison helps to focus the questions they are meant to answer.\nSecond, more recent work on particular secondary qualities is heavily\ninfluenced by diverse philosophical movements and changing views of\nthe relation between philosophy and the sciences which cannot be\nadequately considered here (see Ross 2015). This entry uses the\nfollowing notational conventions: \u201cPQ\u201d stands for\n\u201cprimary quality\u201d; \u201cSQ\u201d, for \u201csecondary\nquality\u201d; additional designations are formed in obvious ways.\nThe name of one PQ or SQ is often used to indicate all qualities of\nthe same type, e.g., \u201cred, etc\u201d. indicates red and the\nother SQs.)\n",
