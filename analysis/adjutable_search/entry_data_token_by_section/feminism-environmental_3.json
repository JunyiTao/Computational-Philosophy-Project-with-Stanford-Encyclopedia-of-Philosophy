First Kind of Position in Feminist Environmental Philosophy: One Historically Associated with a Non-Feminist Environmental Philosophy\nAlthough environmental issues have been addressed by philosophers\nsince Ancient Greece, Western environmental philosophies did not take\nshape until the early 1970s (e.g., Arne Naess 1973; John Passmore\n1973).  Increasingly, unsettling empirical data surfaced concerning\nhuman mistreatment of nonhuman animals (e.g., factory farming), nature\n(e.g., clear-cutting old growth forests), and destructive human-nature\nrelationships (e.g., human creation of unmanaged toxic landfills,\nespecially in communities of color). In addition, many canonical\nassumptions were called into question, such as the view that humans\nand culture are superior to nonhuman animals and nature. Western\nenvironmental philosophies, both feminist and non-feminist, emerged\nfrom such applied and theoretical concerns.\n",
