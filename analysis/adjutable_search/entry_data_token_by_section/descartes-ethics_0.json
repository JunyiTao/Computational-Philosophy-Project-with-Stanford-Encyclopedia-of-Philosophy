The Place of Ethics in Descartes\u2019 Philosophy\n\nDescartes did not write extensively on ethics, and this has led some\nto assume that the topic lacks a place within his philosophy. This\nassumption has been bolstered by the tendency, prevalent until\nrecently, to base an understanding of Descartes\u2019 philosophy\nprimarily on his two most famous books, Discourse on the\nMethod and Meditations on First Philosophy. Although\nboth works offer insight into Descartes\u2019 ethics, neither\npresents his position in detail. (For comprehensive treatments of\nDescartes\u2019 ethical thought, see Kambouchner 2009; Marshall 1998;\nMorgan 1994; Rodis-Lewis 1970.)\n\nDescartes\u2019 writings reveal a consistent conception of\nphilosophy\u2019s goal. In the first rule of the unfinished Rules\nfor the Direction of the Mind, he states: \u201cThe aim of our\nstudies should be to direct the mind with a view to forming true and\nsound judgements about whatever comes before it\u201d (AT X 359/CSM I\n9). The principal goal of philosophy is to cultivate one\u2019s\ncapacity for sound judgment, which Descartes identifies with\n\u201cgood sense\u201d (le bons sens) and \u201cuniversal\nwisdom.\u201d This goal should be pursued for its own sake, since\nother ends may distract us from the course of inquiry. Nevertheless,\nDescartes insists upon the practical benefits of the wisdom thereby\nachieved: one should consider \u201chow to increase the natural light\nof his reason\u2026 in order that his intellect should show his will\nwhat decision it ought to make in each of life\u2019s\ncontingencies\u201d (AT X 361/CSM I 10). In this way, we can expect\nto realize the \u201clegitimate fruits\u201d of the sciences:\n\u201cthe comforts of life\u201d and \u201cthe pleasure to be\ngained from contemplating the truth, which is practically the only\nhappiness in this life that is complete and untroubled by pain\u201d\n(ibid.).\n\nThe last point previews one of the principal concerns of\nDescartes\u2019 ethics. In agreement with the ancients, he takes\nphilosophy\u2019s practical goal to be the realization of a happy\nlife: one in which we enjoy the best existence that a human being can\nhope to achieve. Descartes characterizes this life in terms of a type\nof mental contentment, or tranquility, that is experienced by the\nperson with a well-ordered mind. Here the influence of Stoic and\nEpicurean writers is evident (Cottingham 1998; Gueroult 1985; Pereboom\n1994; Rutherford 2014). In keeping with a central theme of Hellenistic\nethics, Descartes likens philosophy to a form of therapy that can\ntreat the mind\u2019s illnesses (those that stand in the way of its\nhappiness), just as medicine treats the illnesses of the body. As he\nwrites in one of his earliest recorded remarks, \u201cI use the term\n\u2018vice\u2019 to refer to the diseases of the mind, which are not\nso easy to recognize as diseases of the body. This is because we have\nfrequently experienced sound bodily health, but have never known true\nhealth of the mind\u201d (AT X 215/CSM I 3). Philosophy is thus\ncharged with leading us to \u201ctrue health of the mind,\u201d\nwhich it does through the cultivation of \u201ctrue and sound\njudgment.\u201d It is significant that Descartes\u2014again in\nagreement with the ancients\u2014focuses his efforts on the happiness\nthat can be realized within the natural life of a human being. He is\ncareful to note that it is a dogma of faith that \u201cthe supreme\nhappiness,\u201d consisting \u201csolely in the contemplation of the\ndivine majesty\u201d and attainable only through divine grace, is\nreserved for the \u201cnext life\u201d (AT VII 52/CSM II 36).\nHowever, in contrast to the position defended by Aquinas and Roman\nCatholic theology, the consideration of this \u201csupernatural\nbliss\u201d (b\u00e9atitude surnaturelle) plays no role in\nDescartes\u2019 system. On the contrary, he emphasizes that genuine\nhappiness is attainable within this life, in spite of the trials we\nface. \u201cOne of the main points of my own ethical code,\u201d he\ntells Mersenne, \u201cis to love life without fearing death\u201d\n(AT II 480\u20131/CSMK 131). The key to developing this affirmative\nattitude toward life is the cultivation of reason: \u201cTrue\nphilosophy\u2026 teaches that even amidst the saddest disasters and\nmost bitter pains we can always be content, provided that we know how\nto use our reason\u201d (AT IV 314/CSMK 272).\n\nDescartes\u2019 estimation of the importance of ethics is expressed\nmost clearly in the programmatic statement that prefaces the French\ntranslation of the Principles of Philosophy (1647). Here he\npresents his conception of philosophy in strikingly traditional terms:\n\u201cthe word \u2018philosophy\u2019 means the study of wisdom,\nand by \u2018wisdom\u2019 is meant not only prudence in our everyday\naffairs but also a perfect knowledge of all things that mankind is\ncapable of knowing, both for the conduct of life and for the\npreservation of health and the discovery of all manner of\nskills\u201d (AT IXB 2/CSM I 179). The key to the attainment of this\nwisdom, Descartes argues, is the recognition of the essential order\namong the different parts of our knowledge, an order he depicts in his\nimage of the \u201ctree of philosophy\u201d: \u201cThe roots are\nmetaphysics, the trunk is physics, and the branches emerging from the\ntrunk are all the other sciences, which may be reduced to three\nprincipal ones, namely medicine, mechanics and morals\u201d (AT IXB\n14/CSM I 186). Within this scheme, metaphysics is foundational, but\nthis knowledge and the knowledge of physics that is built upon it are\nsought for the sake of the practical benefits that follow from the\nsciences of medicine, mechanics and morals: \u201cjust as it is not\nthe roots or the trunk of a tree from which one gathers the fruit, but\nonly the ends of the branches, so the principal benefit of philosophy\ndepends on those parts of it which can only be learned last of\nall\u201d (AT IXB 15/CSM I 186). Foremost among these sciences is\nla morale: \u201cthe highest and most perfect moral system,\nwhich presupposes a complete knowledge of the other sciences and is\nthe ultimate level of wisdom\u201d (ibid.). It is for the sake of\nthis science above all that Descartes hopes his readers will\n\u201crealize how important it is to continue the search for these\ntruths, and to what a high degree of wisdom, and to what perfection\nand felicity of life, these truths can bring us\u201d (AT IXB 20/CSM\nI 190).\n\nWhile it is clear that Descartes accords a privileged place to the\nscience he calls la morale, the fact remains that he left no\nsystematic presentation of his ethical views. He offers several\nexplanations for why he has not devoted more attention to ethics.\nGiven his conception of the order of knowledge, conclusions in ethics\nmust be established in a way that reveals their dependence on the\nprior conclusions of metaphysics and physics. Thus, the systematic\ninvestigation of ethics can begin only after certainty has been\nachieved in these prior theoretical disciplines. In a late letter to\nChanut, Descartes cites two further reasons for his silence on the\ntopic: \u201cIt is true that normally I refuse to write down my\nthoughts concerning morality. I have two reasons for this. One is that\nthere is no other subject in which malicious people can so readily\nfind pretexts for vilifying me; and the other is that I believe only\nsovereigns, or those authorized by them, have the right to concern\nthemselves with regulating the morals of other people\u201d (AT V\n86\u20137/CSMK 326). The first of these reasons reflects\nDescartes\u2019 inherent caution, reinforced by the hostile reception\nhis philosophy had received at the University of Utrecht (Gaukroger\n1995; Verbeek 1992). The second points to an important limitation in\nDescartes\u2019 conception of ethics: he does not enunciate a\nspecific set of obligations, because these, he believes, are the\npurview of the sovereign. This again may make it seem that Descartes\nrejects a substantial role for philosophy in ethics, and that he\noffers in its place a Hobbesian account of the authority of moral\ndictates grounded in a sovereign will. There is an element of truth in\nthis suggestion, but uncovering it requires drawing a crucial\ndistinction: if Descartes limits the role of philosophy in determining\nspecific moral rules, he nonetheless upholds the ancients\u2019\nconception of philosophy as the search for a wisdom sufficient for\nhappiness. It is in this sense that ethics remains central to\nDescartes\u2019 philosophy.\n",
