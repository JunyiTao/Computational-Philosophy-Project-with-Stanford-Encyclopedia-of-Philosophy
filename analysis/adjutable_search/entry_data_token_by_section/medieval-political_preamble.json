    "main_text": "\n\nMedieval philosophy is the philosophy produced in Western Europe\nduring the middle ages. There is no consensus, even among\nmedievalists, as to when this period begins or\n ends;[1]\n however, it is conventional\u2014and probably neither fully correct\nnor incorrect\u2014to begin with\n Augustine\n (354\u2013430), and note that the influence of medieval philosophy\ncontinued past even the birth of\n Descartes\n (1596\u20131650). Medieval political philosophy is the part\nof medieval philosophy that is concerned with political matters.\nPhilosophical writing about politics during the middle ages (as during\nthe early modern period) was often an attempt to influence public\nevents, and the history of the subject therefore involves reference to\nthose events. It also involves reference to developments in medieval\nculture, e.g., the renaissances of the ninth and twelfth centuries,\nand to the development of institutions such as the legal system and\nthe universities. The strong relationship during this period between\nphilosophy and religion also complicates the story. These\n\u201cextra-philosophical\u201d connections are among the reasons\nwhy political philosophy underwent considerable development in the\ncourse of the middle ages, as religious and political thinking was\nmodified by cultural developments and the stress of events. The focus\nis on the theologians and philosophers of the Latin Middle Ages, and\nthe general arrangement of this article is\n chronological.[2]\n\n",
