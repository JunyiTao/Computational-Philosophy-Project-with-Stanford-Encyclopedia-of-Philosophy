    "main_text": "Continuing Evolution || Incorporating theoretical developments\n7. The Future of Feminist Bioethics\n\nFeminist bioethics arose originally out of women\u2019s responses to\nthe inadequacies of mainstream bioethics, one of which was perceived\nto be its lack of radical edge, or perhaps better, its political\ntimidity. Like any movement with progressive goals, feminist bioethics\nin some sense aims to put itself out of business: it wants to see the\ncriticisms it presents to the mainstream acknowledged and the defects\nremedied. Feminist approaches work to transform the bioethical labor\ngoing on at the heart of the discipline, and indeed many of its\ninsights have been absorbed into the mainstream. Examples include the\nso-called empirical turn in bioethics and a recognition of structural\ninequities in healthcare. But this kind of success is always\ndouble-edged, and many feminist bioethicists will have felt irritation\nat the amnesia (or willful ignorance) of mainstream bioethics about\nthe source of these vital insights. More seriously, there is a danger\nthat the power and perceptiveness of feminist critique will dissipate\nas (or if) it loses its outsider status.\n\nNevertheless, while the incorporation of feminist ideas may have\nsmudged the line between mainstream and feminist bioethics, any\nassimilation of feminist ideas into mainstream bioethics is restricted\nto its theoretical and methodological approaches and largely excludes\nthe specific goals of fostering gender and social justice. Beyond the\nacademy, recent social and political developments, ranging from the\nerosion of reproductive autonomy in the overturning of Roe v.\nWade in June 2022, to the gendered impact of the global COVID-19\npandemic, have been salutary lessons in the precarity of feminist\ngains in the wider world.\n\nFeminist bioethics continues to develop in response to medical and\nlife science research on the one hand, and developments in philosophy\nand social theory on the other. It also reflects the establishment of\nnew fields of inquiry, such as AI ethics, and the disruption of old\ndisciplinary boundaries. In this respect it is not so different from\nmainstream bioethics overall. What makes it distinctively feminist is\nthe underlying commitment to the political goal of identifying\npractices that harm and disadvantage women, grounded in the conviction\nthat this will produce a better and fairer world not just for women,\nbut for everyone.\n",
