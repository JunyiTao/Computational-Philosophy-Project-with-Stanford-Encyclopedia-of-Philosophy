    "main_text": "Consciousness, Mind, and Personal Identity || Self-Illumination of Consciousness\n3.2 Self-Illumination of Consciousness\n\nWitnessing consciousness is elusive because it is unobjectifiable. It\nescapes our attention because it stands behind cognitive\nintentionality and cannot attend to itself. One cannot isolate the\nwitness by pulling it to one side and objects to another, for in\ndrawing a line between the two, both become objects of consciousness.\nConsciousness cannot become an objective content of consciousness. If\none infers that this non-finding of consciousness is evidence of its\nnon-existence, \u015aa\u1e45kara counters that one cannot deny their\nown consciousness (BrS\u016bBh 2.3.7). Consciousness is self-evident.\nIt cannot admit its own absence or antecedent negation, for any\ndismissal of consciousness presupposes its very existence.\nConsciousness thus falls outside the scope of negation.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara defines the intrinsic nature of consciousness as\nuniquely self-illuminating (svaprak\u0101\u015ba) because it\ndoes not require a second awareness for it to be known. Consciousness\nis intrinsically reflexive, immediate, and self-revealing in all\ncognition, while simultaneously remaining the non-object of knowledge.\nIt is self-established in that it does not require a means of\nknowledge to be known, nor any proof or justification for its\nexistence. It is self-disclosing. No second thing mediates its access\nto itself (see \u015aa\u1e45kara on B\u1e5bUBh 4.3, TaiUBh\n2.1.1).\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara repudiates rival philosophies such as the\nNy\u0101ya school which rejects witnessing consciousness and\nself-illumination in favor of other-illumination\n(paraprak\u0101\u015ba)\u2014a thesis more akin to\ncontemporary higher order theories. Ny\u0101ya argues that a second\ncognition is required to illumine the first.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara\u2019s basic counter-critique is that if a primary\ncognition requires a second apperceptive cognition to be known, then\nthe second would require a third, etc., leading to a vicious infinite\nregression fallacy. In that case no perception could ever be known.\nThe self-illumination of witnessing consciousness accounts for the\nimmediacy of cognition without falling into an infinite regress of\nmental modes (BrS\u016bBh 2.2.28; B\u1e5bUBh 4.3.7). There is no need\nto apprehend the witness because it is self-established. If\nconsciousness cannot become its own object, yet does not require a\nsecond, subsequent, or higher order cognition to reveal itself, than\nan infinite regression fallacy does not arise.\n\n\u015aa\u1e45kara also critiques the view of some Mah\u0101y\u0101na\nBuddhist philosophers, Vasubandhu and Dharmak\u012brti for example,\nwho argue that a given cognition or mental state can simultaneously\nreveal itself and its object. Their self-illumination thesis is quite\nsimilar to Advaita Ved\u0101nta but endeavors to be more parsimonious\nby eliding the witnessing consciousness. \u015aa\u1e45kara counters\nthat a self-illuminating cognition is incoherent because it is subject\nto the reflexivity fallacy (BrS\u016bBh 2.2.28). Just as a knife\ncannot cut itself, so too is cognition unable to objectify itself. A\ncognition requires a different source of illumination to be known.\nThis is also a matter of direct experience, for we are aware of a\ncognition\u2019s changes such as its origination and destruction and\nthe arising of a new cognition. A source of illumination distinct from\nthe cognition itself is required to know such changes.\n\u015aa\u1e45kara contends that the self-illumination of witnessing\nconsciousness does not similarly fall to a reflexivity fallacy (KeUBh\n1.3). Even though consciousness is immediately known, it does not\nobjectify itself. Self-illuminating consciousness does not come into a\nrelationship with itself. It does not entail being subject and object\nsimultaneously, which would be incoherent, for there is no distinction\nto be made between itself and consciousness of itself. (See Mackenzie\n2012; Ram-Prasad 2007; Timalsina 2009; Indich 1980; and Fasching 2021\nfor further discussions of self-illumination).\n",
