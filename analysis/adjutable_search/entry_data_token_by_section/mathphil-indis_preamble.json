    "main_text": "\n\nOne of the most intriguing features of mathematics is its\napplicability to empirical science. Every branch of science draws upon\nlarge and often diverse portions of mathematics, from the use of\nHilbert spaces in quantum mechanics to the use of differential\ngeometry in general relativity. It\u2019s not just the physical\nsciences that avail themselves of the services of mathematics either.\nBiology, for instance, makes extensive use of difference equations and\nstatistics. The roles mathematics plays in these theories is also\nvaried. Not only does mathematics help with empirical predictions, it\nallows elegant and economical statement of many theories. Indeed, so\nimportant is the language of mathematics to science, that it is hard\nto imagine how theories such as quantum mechanics and general\nrelativity could even be stated without employing a substantial amount\nof mathematics. \n\nFrom the rather remarkable but seemingly uncontroversial fact that\nmathematics is indispensable to science, some philosophers have drawn\nserious metaphysical conclusions. In particular, Quine (1976; 1980a;\n1980b; 1981a; 1981c) and Putnam (1979a; 1979b) have argued that the\nindispensability of mathematics to empirical science gives us good\nreason to believe in the existence of mathematical entities. According\nto this line of argument, reference to (or quantification over)\nmathematical entities such as sets, numbers, functions and such is\nindispensable to our best scientific theories, and so we ought to be\ncommitted to the existence of these mathematical entities. To do\notherwise is to be guilty of what Putnam has called\n\u201cintellectual dishonesty\u201d (Putnam 1979b, p. 347).\nMoreover, mathematical entities are seen to be on an epistemic par\nwith the other theoretical entities of science, since belief in the\nexistence of the former is justified by the same evidence that\nconfirms the theory as a whole (and hence belief in the latter). This\nargument is known as the Quine-Putnam indispensability argument for\nmathematical realism. There are other indispensability arguments, but\nthis one is by far the most influential, and so in what follows,\nwe\u2019ll mostly focus on it. \n\nIn general, an indispensability argument is an argument that purports\nto establish the truth of some claim based on the indispensability of\nthe claim in question for certain purposes (to be specified by the\nparticular argument). For example, if explanation is\nspecified as the purpose, then we have an explanatory indispensability\nargument. Thus we see that inference to the best explanation is a\nspecial case of an indispensability argument. See the introduction of\nField (1989, pp. 14\u201320) for a nice discussion of\nindispensability arguments and inference to the best explanation. See\nalso Maddy (1992) and Resnik (1995a) for variations on the\nQuine-Putnam version of the argument. We should add that although the\nversion of the argument presented here is generally attributed to\nQuine and Putnam, it differs in a number of ways from the arguments\nadvanced by either Quine or\n Putnam.[1]\n\n",
