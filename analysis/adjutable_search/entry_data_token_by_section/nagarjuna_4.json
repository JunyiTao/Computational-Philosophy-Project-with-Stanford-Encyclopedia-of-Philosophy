    "main_text": "Arguments against svabh\u0101va || Change\n3.2 Change\n\nThe discussion of change, in particular that of spatio-temporal\nchange, of motion, occupies a prominent position in\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s arguments. In the second chapter of the\nMMK we find a long discussion of the impossibility of motion.\nParallels with Zeno\u2019s paradoxes have been drawn and it has been\nargued that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s aim was to refute certain\nviews of the structure of space and time (Siderits and O\u2019Brien\n1976). Nevertheless, there is some evidence that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\ntwo main aims were something else: firstly, to reject a substantialist\ninterpretation of some of the key notions of the Buddhist teaching\nand, secondly, to defend a specific view of the relation between\nindividuals and their properties.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna employs two key arguments that we might want to\ncall the property-absence argument and the property-duplication\nargument. The first (MMK 2:3\u20133, 9\u201310) questions the\nsuitability of such statements like \u201cthe mover moves\u201d\nbecause there are difficulties conceiving of a mover without motion.\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that there is a difficulty with thinking of\nthe individual (the mover) and the property (the motion) in the\nfamiliar way, as mutually independent objects. In the case of a blue\nvase the vase and the blueness can exist without each other (at least\nas long as we are not trope theorists) whereas there clearly is no\nmover that does not move. The two stand in a dependence relation since\nthe individual depends on the property it instantiates. It therefore\ncannot exist by svabh\u0101va.\n\nThe second argument (MMK 2:5, 11) states that if we were to think in\nterms of a mover moving there would be two motions rather than one:\nthat motion which makes the mover a mover, and that motion by which it\nmoves. The reason for this is that a mover is an example of an\nindividual where a distinction between its constitutive and\ninstantiated properties cannot be drawn. The constitutive property is\nwhat constitutes an individual (something is a cube, or a pot, or a\nvase) and the instantiated properties are had by the individual (it is\nheavy, or round, or blue). If we apply these notions to the case of\nthe moving mover we would require two different motions: one which\nconstitutes the individual and one which is its property. But of\ncourse there is only one motion: that of the moving mover. The point\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna makes here is not just there are problems when\nanalyzing statements like \u201cthe mover moves\u201d, \u201cthe\nthunder roars\u201d and so forth in terms of an ontology of\nconstitutive and instantiated properties but the more general\nobservation that this has implications for the way we can apply these\nterms even to more usual statements like \u201cthe vase is\nblue\u201d. That the distinction between constitutive and\ninstantiated properties makes no sense in the case of \u201cthe mover\nmoves\u201d shows that there is no substantial distinction between\nthese properties, and that the conceptualization of a situation in\nterms of them is purely a result of cognitive convenience. Since we\nwant to stress certain features we speak of a blue, round vase instead\nof a vase-shaped, round, blue thing or a vase-shaped, blue, round\nthing, but this in no way implies that there is a fundamental\ndifference between the properties \u201cbeing a vase\u201d,\n\u201cbeing round\u201d, and \u201cbeing blue\u201d so that only\none of them is constitutive while the others are instantiated. There\nis no ready-made world that is already sliced in such a way.\n\nWhen N\u0101g\u0101rjuna argues that neither mover nor motion exist by\nsvabh\u0101va he first of all makes an important point about\nsome central concepts of the Buddhist world-view. The goal of the\nBuddhist path is the liberation from cyclic existence, a form of\nexistence that is nothing but the moving about (sams\u1e5b)\nthrough a succession of rebirths. When N\u0101g\u0101rjuna speaks\nabout the mover (gati) he has in mind both the familiar\nmotion from one end of the road to another one as well as the motion\nfrom one life to the next. N\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s arguments to\nthe effect that mover and motion are interdependent, that the\nbeginning and end of motion are not to be found \u201cout\nthere\u201d in the world entail that the person who is reborn, the\ncyclic existence he is reborn in and the liberation from that cyclic\nexistence do not exist substantially.\n\nN\u0101g\u0101rjuna\u2019s second main point is that his analysis of\nmotion has specific implications for our view of individuals and\nproperties. The aim of his arguments is to show that the distinction\nbetween individuals and properties is not one which exists independent\nof our conceptualizations. As the talk about the\n\u2018property\u2019 instantiated by an individual like a mover or a\nclap of thunder had to be explained in terms of a single feature seen\nin two different ways \u2013 as constitutive and as instantiating\n\u2013 in the same way talk of the properties of ordinary individuals\nsuch as a blue vase could be seen to be equally a reflection of the\ndivision of their features into constitutive and instantiating\nproperties, something which is just a reflection of our pragmatic\nconcerns in conceptualizing the individual in question, but not a\nreflection of its intrinsic nature.\n\nFor the Madhyamaka school conceiving of substances as individuals\ninstantiating properties is deeply unsatisfactory. For the sake of\nillustration (and using an Indian example) assume a substantially\nreal, fundamental entity the only property of which is being spatially\nextended. Now what is the individual in which this property inheres?\nAs it is not characterized by any other properties it must be some\nkind of propertyless bare particular. What makes it a bare particular?\nGiven that we are dealing with substances here it should not depend on\nsome other object. But if it is a bare particular by\nsvabh\u0101va and being a bare particular is therefore its\nintrinsic nature we are in the same situation as we were with the\nspatially extended entity. For now we can ask what the individual is\nin which being a bare particular inheres, and then we are well on our\nway into an infinite regress. Note that this problem does not got away\nif we feel uneasy about the property \u2018being a bare\nparticular\u2019 and do not want to admit it. For we have to assume\nthat the individual has some determinate nature due to which it is a\nbearer of its properties and the difficulty will just reappear with\nwhatever we take such a nature to be.\n\nIt does not help much if we conceive of substances as particularized\nproperties or tropes instead. For then it is unclear how we can\nindividuate one spatial-extension-trope from another. We cannot\ndifferentiate them according to the individuals in which they inhere\nbecause we have just rejected the existence of individuals at the\nlevel of substances. We cannot say that this spatial-extension-trope\nis different from that because they turn up in different individuals,\nsince the different individuals are just collections of tropes. Of\ncourse we could try to tell apart the various trope-substances by the\ncollections in which they occur (or, more precisely, by which other\ntropes they are related to via a higher-order compresence-trope). The\ndifficulty for this is that it introduces dependence-relations via the\nback door, for every trope will existentially depend on being\nconnected to just these other tropes via a compresence-trope \u2014\nwe cannot take a trope and \u2018move\u2019 it to another\ncollection. As we want to conceive of substances as entities that are\nnot existentially dependent on one another this approach inevitably\nintroduces a certain tension into our system. It thus becomes apparent\nthat once more a conceptual scheme that can be more or less\nstraightforwardly applied to non-substances breaks down once we\nattempt to analyse the supposedly foundational objects of our world in\nterms of it. While the analysis of a red apple into an individual and\nthe property it instantiates is at least on the face of it\nunproblematic, the same analysis generates problems when applied to\nultimate existents.
