    "main_text": "\n\n\nThe culture of the Akan people of West Africa dates from before the\n13th century. Like other long-established cultures the world over, the\nAkan have developed a rich conceptual system complete with\nmetaphysical, moral, and epistemological aspects. Of particular\ninterest is the Akan conception of persons, a conception that\ninforms a variety of social institutions, practices, and judgments\nabout personal identity, moral responsibility, and the proper\nrelationship both among individuals and between individuals and\ncommunity.\n\n\nThis overview presents the Akan conception of persons as seen by two\nmajor contemporary Akan philosophers, Kwasi Wiredu and Kwame\nGyekye. These scholars present two very different accounts of the\nconcept, particularly with respect to the relationship between social\nrecognition and innate characteristics to personhood. Examining the\nAkan conception of personhood from these two different perspectives\nhighlights both the richness of the conception as well as the myriad\nways in which the resulting conception contrasts with Western\nconceptions. Among those contrasts are four on which we focus below:\n(1) the continuous nature of personhood, (2) the means by which\nindividuals achieve full personhood, and the implications of this\nconception of personhood for (3) the relationship between individuals\nand the community and (4) the Akan understanding of responsibility and\nfreedom.\n\n\nThe debate between Wiredu and Gyekye provides insights regarding not\njust the substance of the conception of personhood, but also the way\nempirical evidence can be used to inform philosophical analysis. In\nthis particular case, the Akan view of personhood has, like many other\nmetaphysical and moral conceptions, far-reaching effects on social\npractices and institutions. Using facts about these practices and\ninstitutions to reconstruct a conception of personhood underscores\nanother important general theme in African philosophy: the practical\nimplications of philosophical principles on everyday life. For the\nAkan, judgments about personhood are not matter of merely academic\ninterest, but play an important role in shaping and supporting their\nhighly communal social structure. To the extent that the Akan notion\naccommodates a common humanity as an innate source of value, it\nsupports moral equality. At the same time, its emphasis on the social\nbases of personhood helps firmly to embed trust, cooperation, and\nresponsibility to the community in cultural practices. The Akan\nphilosophy of persons thus represents an attempt to resolve questions\nof identity, freedom, and morality in favor of a communalistic way of\nlife that has evolved as a rational adaptation to the exigencies of\nsurvival under harsh conditions.\n",
