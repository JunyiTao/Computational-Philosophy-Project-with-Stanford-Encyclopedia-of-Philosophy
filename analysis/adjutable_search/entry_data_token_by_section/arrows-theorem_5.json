    "main_text": "Impossibility\n3. Impossibility\nWith the conceptual framework now in\nplace, Section 3.1 sets out the\n\u201cconditions\u201d or constraints that Arrow imposed on social\nwelfare functions, and Section 3.2 states the\ntheorem itself.  Section 4 explains the\nconditions more fully, discusses reasons that Arrow gave for imposing\nthem, and considers whether it is proper to do so. \nArrow\u2019s conditions often are called axioms, and his approach is\nsaid to be axiomatic. This might be found misleading. Unlike axioms of\nlogic or geometry, Arrow\u2019s conditions are not supposed to express more\nor less indubitable truths, or to constitute an implicit definition of\nthe object of study. Arrow himself took them to be questionable\n\u201cvalue judgments\u201d that \u201cexpress the doctrines of\ncitizens\u2019 sovereignty and rationality in a very general form\u201d\n(Arrow 1951 [1963]: 31). Indeed, as we will see\nin Section 4, and as Arrow himself recognized,\nsometimes it is not even desirable that social welfare functions\nshould satisfy all conditions of the impossibility theorem.\nArrow restated the conditions in the second edition of Social\nChoice and Individual Values (Arrow 1963). They appear here in\nthe canonical form into which they have settled since then.\n",
