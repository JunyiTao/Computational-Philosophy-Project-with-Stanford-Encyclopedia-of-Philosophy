    "main_text": "\n\n\nTo most AI researchers, the frame problem is the challenge of\nrepresenting the effects of action in logic without having to represent\nexplicitly a large number of intuitively obvious non-effects. But to many\nphilosophers, the AI researchers' frame problem is suggestive of\nwider epistemological issues. Is it possible, in principle, to limit\nthe scope of the reasoning required to derive the consequences of an\naction? And, more generally, how do we account for our apparent ability\nto make decisions on the basis only of what is relevant to an ongoing\nsituation without having explicitly to consider all that is not\nrelevant?\n",
