So conceived, the Akan notion of\npersonhood helps to support social cooperation and provides a\nframework superbly suited to resolving collective action problems. The\nAkan have fashioned a means of motivating individuals to contribute to\nthe social good while still insuring that the moral value of even the\nmost unproductive individual is retained. For the Akan, personhood is\nthe reward for contributing to the community and the basis of the\nindividual's moral worth is located in an independent source\u2014a\ncommon humanity.\n",
