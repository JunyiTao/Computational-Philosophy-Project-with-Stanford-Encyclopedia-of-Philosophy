The process of knowing is essentially reconsidered as a\nprocess of self-understanding, or self-articulation, of the open world\n(Cunico 2000). The epistemic categories are thus the forms of\nexistence, but instead of spirit Bloch deals with matter. Since this\nmaterial world is unfinished, his epistemology also implies the active\ninvolvement in the world, a network of concepts referring to each\nother (Holz 1975), without stable definitions, but rather as being the\noutcomes of dialectical processes. It is also by recourse to\ndialectics that Bloch is trying to resolve the difficulty of grasping\nradical novelty, while maintaining that it has not been revealed.\nBloch often uses the dialectical figures of mediation in, e.g.,\nwilling to synthesize Kant and Hegel in The Spirit of Utopia\n(Bloch 1918 [2000: 185f.]), or utopias of freedom (as advanced by\nThomas More) and order (envisioned by\nTommaso Campanella) in The Principle of\nHope (Bloch 1954\u201359 [1986a: 528f.]). But Bloch eventually\nwants to go beyond Hegel because he lacks there the true novelty, the\nopenness, and sees in it the reduction of the existential experience\nto the movement of the totality (something Bloch also bemoans in the\nmost advanced piece of Hegelian Marxism he was exposed to, namely,\nLuk\u00e1cs\u2019 History and Class Consciousness) (Hudson\n1982).\n\nBloch\u2019s attention to existential experiences and his tendency,\nin his aesthetic essays, to reflect on specific, rich thingness (like\nthat of an old pitcher in The Spirit of Utopia) prompt\nparallels to Heidegger\u2014to the point that Bloch was sometimes\neven referred to as a left-\u00adwing Heidegger. Moreover, the\npolitical proclivities of Heidegger are paralleled in Bloch\u2019s\nStalinist posture of the 1930s (M\u00fcnster 1987; Zipes\n2019). Indeed, Bloch poses the question of being as early as 1918 and\ntries to answer it with the focus on human existence (Riedel 1994),\nwhile Heidegger\u2019s gives priority to the future in his analysis\nof temporality (Levinas 1976).  But for Heidegger, the feeling of\nthrownness and the existential fear (Angst) are central\naffects pertaining to the future, which is obviously opposed to\nBloch\u2019s idea of futurity. Bloch\u2019s Heimat, unlike\nHeidegger\u2019s, is something to be anticipated, as a horizon of the\nutopian movement, and not something that precedes our experience as\nits lost foundation (Habermas 1969/1970; Korstvedt 2010), it is,\nmoreover, something one needs to actively precipitate and not\npassively expect.\n",
