Method and Metaphysics in the Statesman\n\n\nLike the Sophist, the opening division in the \nStatesman locates a problem with its target kind. Whereas \nthe sophist turned up all over the tree, the statesman turns up at a \nsingle terminus, but he is not alone, since many rivals have a claim \nto be there too. Just as the puzzle about the sophist revealed by the\nopening divisions indicated something significant about the essence \nof a sophist, so the competition at a single terminus indicates \nsomething significant about the essence of a statesman.\n",
