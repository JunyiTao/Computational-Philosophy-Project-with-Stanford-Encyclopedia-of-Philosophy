    "main_text": "Major Arguments from the Treasury of the Abhidharma || Disproof of a Creator God\n2.4 Disproof of a Creator God\n\nIn the Treasury, Vasubandhu provides an argument against the\nexistence of \u012a\u015bvara, a God who is the sovereign creator of\n everything.[29]\n For Vasubandhu, theism is essentially the absurd notion that all of\ncreation might be the result of a single cause. He begins his disproof\nwith what has been called verbal equivocation (Katsura 2003, p. 113),\nand might also be taken as a joke or a pun:\n\n\nLiving beings proceed from conditions; nor is it the case that\n\u201cthe cause (k\u0101ra\u1e47a) of all the world is a\nsingle \u012a\u015bvara, Puru\u1e63a or Pradh\u0101na [i.e.,\nGod].\u201d\n\nWhat is the reason (hetu) for this?\n\nIf you think it is established upon the provision of a reason\n(hetu), this is a refusal of the statement, \u201cthe cause\n(k\u0101ra\u1e47a) of all is a single\n\u012a\u015bvara.\u201d (AKBh 101.19\u201321)\n\n\nThe pun is in the fact that the word for \u201creason,\u201d\nhetu, also means \u201ccause.\u201d It is as if Vasubandhu\nis saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for my [just] cause\nfor believing this, then clearly you don\u2019t believe God is the\ncause of everything! If I believe it, it must be\n\u2019cause God made me believe it!\u201d This is somewhat\nsilly, and apparently an equivocation between reasons and causes.\n\nA more serious reading, though, rises to the surface when we notice\nthat Vasubandhu does not, in fact, verbally equivocate. He uses the\nword hetu to refer to reasons, and another word,\nk\u0101ra\u1e47a, to refer to causes. In his own philosophy,\nVasubandhu separates these two regions of reality quite strictly:\n\u201cCauses\u201d are real, substantial entities, whereas\n\u201creasons\u201d are conceptual constructs devoid of causal\ncapacity. (Cf. Davidson\u2019s \u201cAnomalism of the Mental\u201d;\nsee the entries on\n anomalous monism\n and\n Donald Davidson.)\n This is not to say that Vasubandhu would endorse Sellars\u2019s\nnotion that ideas which inhabit the normative \u201cspace of\nreasons\u201d are irreducible to those within the \u201cspace of\ncauses.\u201d (See the discussion of the myth of the given, in the\nentry on\n Wilfrid Sellars.)\n He would not; on the contrary, for Vasubandhu, to say that something\nis a conceptual construct is to say that it is caused, but in\na way quite different from how it appears. This is developed\nexplicitly in his Yog\u0101c\u0101ra theory of the Three Natures of\nall entities, where one of the natures is said to be how things\nappear, and another is how things are caused. (See the\ndiscussion of three natures and non-duality.)\n\nYet here in the Treasury Vasubandhu is only gesturing in this\ndirection. His non-Buddhist opponents would also like to distinguish\nreasons from causes, so instead of attempting to unify their causal\nbasis himself, Vasubandhu suggests that commitment to the unitary\nnature of divine causality commits them to conflating them. The\nserious point behind the opening joke, then, is that philosophy\nrequires that we make distinctions among ideas and entities, and\ndebate assumes differences of opinion and perspective. For Vasubandhu,\nsuch differences are evidence that it is impossible that all things\nhave issued from a single cause. He begins, then, with a shot across\nthe bow, which expresses just how seriously he will hold the theists\nto their claim that all things have one cause.\n\nThe majority of Vasubandhu\u2019s argument consists in his support\nfor the notion that the diversity of the world\u2014especially its\nchanges through time\u2014are inconsistent with the notion of a\nsingle creator. An important, implicit premise in this argument is the\nnotion that things do not change their defining, characteristic\nnatures. Everything is what it is: \u201cAs for something that\nbecomes different: that very thing being different is not accepted,\nfor it is not acceptable that it differs from itself.\u201d (AKBh\n193.9\u201310) Thus, if God is the cause of everything, God is\nalways the cause of everything\u2014or, if God\u2019s\nnature at time t is to be the cause of everything, then God\nmust cause everything at time t.\n\nIn response, the theist proposes a variety of predictable\nalternatives. One option is that God is posited as the creator of each\nspecific thing at its specific time due to God\u2019s having unique,\ntemporally-indexed desires. One person is caused by God\u2019s desire\nfor a person to be born in Gandh\u0101ra in the fourth century, and\nanother person is caused by God\u2019s desire for a person to be born\nin New York City in 1969. Vasubandhu responds that if that is the\ncase, then things are not caused by a unitary God, but rather each\nthing is caused by one of God\u2019s countless, distinct desires.\nFurthermore, the theist is then responsible to account for the causes\nof those specific desires.\n\nIn addition, specific temporally-indexed desires imply that something\nis interfering with God\u2019s creative action\u2014namely, the\nparticular temporal location. If God is capable of\u2014not only\ncapable of, but having it as His inherent nature to be\u2014creating\nsomething, what could possibly prevent that thing\u2019s occurrence\nat every moment in which God is expressing God\u2019s own nature\n(which should be every moment forever)? If God has the desire for a\ntree in Washington Square Park in 2010, it should always be 2010, with\na tree in Washington Square Park. Why should God wait? (This argument\nrelies upon a typical Buddhist penchant for particulars and moments as\nthe touchstone of the\n real.[30])\n\nOne unwise option the theist proposes is that God\u2019s creation\nchanges through time because God is using other\nelements\u2014material causes, for instance\u2014to bring things\ninto being, and those elements follow their own causal laws. That, of\ncourse, makes God\u2019s actions subject to other causes, and amounts\nto the Buddhist view that all things are the results of multiple\ncauses and conditions. Furthermore, when it is proposed that God\nengages in creation for his own pleasure (pr\u012bti),\nVasubandhu replies that this means that God is not sovereign because\nHe requires a means (up\u0101ya) to bring about a cause,\nnamely his own pleasure. As a cap to this argument, Vasubandhu mocks\nthe idea that a praiseworthy God should be satisfied with the evident\nsuffering of sentient beings. Thus, along with his causal argument,\nVasubandhu throws in a barb from the argument from evil.\n\nVasubandhu\u2019s final argument in this section is to say that\ntheists are, or ought to be, committed to the denial of apparent\ncauses and conditions. If you think that God is the only cause, then\nyou must deny that seeds cause sprouts. This may seem like another\noverly literalistic reading of the nature of God as the only cause,\nbut is God really deserving of the name \u201ccause,\u201d if He has\nintermediary causes do His work of creation? For, Vasubandhu points\nout, ordinarily we do not require that something be an uncaused cause\nin order to call it a \u201ccause.\u201d We call a seed a cause of a\nsprout, even if it is itself caused by a previous plant. So to say\nthat God is the \u201ccause\u201d of the sprout whereas the seed is\nnot amounts to denying a visible cause and replacing it with\nan invisible one. To avoid this, the theist might say that to call God\nthe \u201ccause\u201d is to say that God is the original cause of\ncreation. But if this is what God is doing to gain the name\n\u201ccause,\u201d and God is beginningless (uncaused), then\ncreation too must be beginningless\u2014which means that, once again,\nGod has nothing to do.\n",
