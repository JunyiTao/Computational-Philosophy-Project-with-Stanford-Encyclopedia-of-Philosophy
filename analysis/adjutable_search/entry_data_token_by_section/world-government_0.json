Historical Background\n\nFor I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,\n\nSaw the Vision of the world, and all the wonders that would be;\n\n\u2026\n\nTill the war-drum throbb\u2019d no longer, and the battle-flags were\nfurl\u2019d\n\nIn the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world.\n\n\nThere the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,\n\nAnd the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.\n\n\n\u2014Alfred, Lord Tennyson, \u201cLocksley Hall\u201d (1837)\n\n\nUnited States President Harry Truman, who oversaw the founding of the\nUnited Nations after the Second World War, kept these lines from\nTennyson\u2019s poem in his wallet (Kennedy 2006: xi). After this\nbrutal global war that claimed over fifty million lives, just like\nafter the previous world war in which almost ten million perished,\nordinary people and statespersons alike sought to establish a post-war\ninternational order that would be able to prevent another war of\nglobal devastation from occurring. In fact, since the problem of war,\nor large-scale socially organized violence, has been with us\nthroughout human history, the ideal of a universal community of\nhumankind living in perpetual peace was not at all new.\n\nDerek Heater\u2019s history of ideas of world government and\ncitizenship begins by noting their presence in ancient Chinese and\nIndian as well as Graeco-Roman thought (1996: ix\u2013x). According\nto Heater, the concept of human unity produced an ideal that such\nunity ought to be expressed in political form. The exact nature of\nthat form, however, has changed radically over time. While Stoic ideas\nabout the oneness of the universe were politically inchoate, they\ninspired medieval Christian proposals for a global political\nauthority; at the same time, the historical model of imperial Rome (or\nits myths) inspired medieval quests for world empire.\n\nThe Italian poet, philosopher, and statesperson, Dante\n(1265\u20131321), perhaps best articulated the Christian ideal of\nhuman unity and its expression through a world governed by a universal\nmonarch. In The Banquet [Convivio], Dante argued\nthat wars and all their causes would be eliminated if\n\n\nthe whole earth and all that humans can possess be a monarchy, that\nis, one government under one ruler. Because he possesses everything,\nthe ruler would not desire to possess anything further, and thus, he\nwould hold kings contentedly within the borders of their kingdoms, and\nkeep peace among them. (Convivio, bk 4, ch 4 [2000: 169])\n\n\nIn De Monarchia (1309\u201313: 8]), a full political\ntreatise affirming universal monarchy, Dante draws on Aristotle to\nargue that human unity stems from a shared end, purpose or function,\nto develop and realize fully and constantly humanity\u2019s distinct\nintellectual potential. In Book I, Dante argues that peace is a vital\ncondition for realizing this end, and peace cannot be maintained if\nhumanity is divided. Just as \u201c[e]very kingdom divided against\nitself shall be laid waste\u201d (Monarchia bk 1, ch. V,\nquoting Luke 11:17 [1995: 10]), since humankind shares one goal,\n\n\nthere must therefore be one person who directs and rules mankind, and\nhe is properly called \u201cMonarch\u201d or \u201cEmperor\u201d.\nAnd thus it is apparent that the well-being of the world requires that\nthere be a monarchy or empire. (Monarchia bk 1, ch. V [1995:\n10])\n\n\nMost importantly, when conflicts inevitably arise between two rulers\nwho are equals, \u201cthere must be a third party of wider\njurisdiction who rules over both of them by right\u201d; a universal\nmonarch is necessary as\n\n\na first and supreme judge, whose judgment resolves all disputes either\ndirectly or indirectly. (Monarchia bk 1, ch. X [1995:\n14])\n\n\nIn the absence of a universal monarch, humanity is \u201ctransformed\ninto a many-headed beast\u201d, striving after \u201cconflicting\nthings\u201d (Monarchia bk 1, ch. XVI [1995: 28]); humankind\nordered under a universal monarch, however,\n\n\nwill most closely resemble God, by mirroring the principle of oneness\nor unity of which he is the supreme example. (Monarchia bk 1,\nch. VIII [1995: 19])\n\n\nDante completes his treatise by extolling the Roman Empire as a part\nof God\u2019s providence (Monarchia bks 2 and 3 [1995:\n30\u201394). And while Dante argued for a universal emperor whose\ntemporal power was distinct from the pope\u2019s religious power, and\nnot derivative from the latter, he envisioned that God\u2019s will\nmust require pope and emperor to forge a cooperative and conciliatory,\nrather than competitive and antagonistic, relationship.\n\nThe idea of uniting humanity under one empire or monarch, however,\nbecame an ambivalent appeal by the seventeenth century with the\nentrenchment in Europe of the system of sovereign states after the\nPeace of Westphalia (1648). At the same time, European encounters with\nnon-European worlds precipitated European ambitions based on the\nprinciple of promoting civilization as an organizing framework for\nlegitimizing European imperial and colonial expansion into other parts\nof the world (Keene 2002).\n\nIn Leviathan (1651), Hobbes (1588\u20131679) gave the\nquintessential formulation of sovereignty as supreme legal coercive\nauthority over a particular population and territory. Hobbes argued\nthat although mutual vulnerabilities and interests lead individuals to\ngive up their liberties in the state of nature, in exchange for\nprotection\u2014thereby instituting sovereign states\u2014the\nmiseries that accompany a plurality of sovereign states are not as\nonerous to individuals, hence there is less rational basis for\npolitical organization to move towards a global leviathan:\n\n\nbecause states uphold the Industry of their Subjects; there does not\nfollow from the international state of nature, that misery, which\naccompanies the Liberty of particular men. (1651: ch. 13 [1986:\n188])\n\n\nContrary to realist interpretations of Hobbes in international\nrelations thought, Hobbes did not consider international law or\ncooperation between sovereign states to be impossible or impractical.\nAnticipating the development of international law, collective security\norganizations, the League of Nations and the United Nations, he\naffirmed the possibility and efficacy of leagues of commonwealths\nfounded on the interests of states in peace and justice:\n\n\nLeagues between Common-wealths, over whom there is no humane Power\nestablished, to keep them all in awe, are not onely lawfull [because\nthey are allowed by the commonwealth], but also profitable for the\ntime they last. (1651: ch. 22 [1986: 286])\n\n\nIn Hobbes, we find the first articulation of the argument that a world\nstate is unnecessary, although he envisaged that the development of a\nlawful interstate order is possible, and potentially desirable.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, Charles Castel, Abb\u00e9 de Saint-Pierre\n(1658\u20131743), in his Project for Making Peace Perpetual in\nEurope (1713), extended Hobbes\u2019s argument that a rational\ninterest in self-preservation necessitated the creation a domestic\nleviathan to the international realm, asserting that reason should\nlead the princes of Europe to form a federation of states by social\ncontract. The contracting sovereigns would form a perpetual and\nirrevocable alliance, establishing a permanent Diet or Congress that\nwould adjudicate all conflicts between the contracting parties. The\nfederation would also proscribe as \u201ca public enemy\u201d\n(Rousseau 1756 [1917: 63]) any member who breaks the Treaty or\ndisregards the decisions of the congress; in such a situation, all\nmembers would \u201carm and take the offensive, conjointly and at the\ncommon expense, against any State put to the ban of Europe\u201d in\norder to enforce the decisions of the federation (1756 [1917:\n61\u20134]). In other words, perpetual peace can be achieved if the\nprinces of Europe would agree to relinquish their sovereign rights to\nmake war or peace to a superior, federal body that guaranteed\nprotection of their basic interests.\n\nIn his comments on this proposal, Rousseau (1712\u201378)\nacknowledged its perfect rationality:\n\n\nRealize this Commonwealth of Europe for a single day, and you may be\nsure it will last forever; so fully would experience convince men that\ntheir own gain is to be found in the good of all. (1756 [1917:\n93])\n\n\nTo Rousseau, however, existing societies had so thoroughly corrupted\nhumans\u2019 natural innocence that they were largely incapable of\ndiscovering their true or real interests. Thus, the\nAbb\u00e9\u2019s proposals were not utopian, but they were not\nlikely to be realized \u201cbecause men are crazy, and to be sane in\na world of madmen is itself a kind of madness\u201d (1756 [1917:\n91]). At the same time, Rousseau noted that the sovereigns of Europe\nwere not likely to agree voluntarily to form such a federation:\n\n\nNo Federation could ever be established except by a revolution. That\nbeing so, which of us would dare say whether the League of Europe is a\nthing more to be desired or feared? It would perhaps do more harm in\nthe moment than it would guard against for ages. (1756 [1917:\n112])\n\n\nThis consequentialist objection to the idea of world\ngovernment speculates that even if it were desirable, the process of\ncreating a world government may produce more harm than good; the\nnecessary evils committed on the road to establishing a world\ngovernment would outweigh whatever benefits might result from its\nachievement.\n\nRousseau viewed war as a product of defectively ordered social\ninstitutions; it is states as public entities that make war, and\nindividuals participate in wars only as members or citizens of states.\nFar from viewing the achievement of a domestic leviathan as moral\nprogress, Rousseau noted that the condition of a world of entangled\nsovereign states puts human beings in more peril than if no such\ninstitutions existed at all. Isn\u2019t it the case, he argued,\nthat\n\n\neach one of us being in the civil state as regards our fellow\ncitizens, but in the state of nature as regards the rest of the world,\nwe have taken all kinds of precautions against private wars only to\nkindle national wars a thousand times more terrible? And that, in\njoining a particular group of men, we have really declared ourselves\nthe enemies of the whole race? (1756 [1917: 56])\n\n\nIn Rousseau\u2019s view, the solution to war is to establish\nwell-governed societies, along the lines he established in The\nSocial Contract (1762); only in such contexts will human beings\nrealize their full rational and moral potential. To establish\nperpetual peace, then, we should not pursue world government, but the\nmoral perfection of states. A world of ideal societies would have no\ncause for war, and no need for world government.\n\nKant tried, in his Idea for a Universal History with a\nCosmopolitan Purpose (1784), to refute the claim that the\ndevelopment of the domestic state constituted a moral step backwards\nfor humankind, by placing it and its trials\n\n\nin the history of the entire species, as a steadily advancing but slow\ndevelopment of man\u2019s original [rational] capacities. (1784\n[1991: 41])\n\n\nNature employs the \u201cunsociableness of men\u201d to motivate\nmoral progress; thus war is a means by which nature moves states\n\n\nto take the step which reason could have suggested to them even\nwithout so many sad experiences\u2014that of abandoning a lawless\nstate of savagery and entering a federation of peoples in which every\nstate, even the smallest, could expect to derive its security and\nrights not from its own power or its own legal judgment, but solely\nfrom this great federation (Foedus Amphictyonum), from a\nunited power and the law-governed decisions of a united will. (1784\n[1991: 47])\n\n\nThis is the \u201cinevitable outcome\u201d (1784 [1991: 48]) of\nhuman history, a point Kant reiterated in Perpetual Peace\n[1795], when he argued that rationality dictated the formation of\n\n\nan international state (civitas gentium), which would\nnecessarily continue to grow until it embraced all the peoples of the\nearth. (1784 [1991: 105])\n\n\nIn present conditions, however, Kant noted that \u201cthe positive\nidea of a world republic cannot be realized\u201d, thus his\ntreatise on perpetual peace begins with the social fact of a world of\ndistinct but interacting states. What would be required, given such a\nworld, to achieve perpetual peace? Kant makes three arguments. First,\nevery state must have a republican constitution that guarantees the\nfreedom and equality of citizens through the rule of law and\nrepresentative political institutions. The internally well-ordered\nrepublican state is less likely to engage in wars without good\nreason;\n\n\nunder a constitution where the subject is not a citizen, and which is\ntherefore not republican, it is the simplest thing in the world to go\nto war. (1784 [1991: 100])\n\n\nSecond, such internally well-ordered states would need to enter into a\n\u201cfederation of peoples\u201d, which is distinct from an\n\u201cinternational state\u201d (1784 [1991: 102]). A\n\n\npacific federation (foedus pacificum) \u2026 does not aim\nto acquire any power like that of a state, but merely to preserve and\nsecure the freedom of each state in itself, along with that of the\nother confederated states. (1784 [1991: 104])\n\n\nIn this context, a federal union of free and independent states, he\nargued,\n\n\nis still to be preferred to an amalgamation of the separate nations\nunder a single power which has overruled the rest and created a\nuniversal monarchy.\n\n\nHis reasons against a universal monarchy combine fears of an\nall-powerful and powerless world government:\n\n\nFor the laws progressively lose their impact as the government\nincreases its range, and a soulless despotism, after crushing the\ngerms of goodness, will finally lapse into anarchy. (1784 [1991:\n113])\n\n\nMost forcefully articulating the tyranny objection, Kant argued that a\n\u201cuniversal despotism\u201d would end \u201cin the graveyard of\nfreedom\u201d (1784 [1991: 114]). The third condition for perpetual\npeace in a world of distinct but interacting states is the observance\nof cosmopolitan right, which Kant limits to universal hospitality.\nAlthough the human race shares in common a right to the earth\u2019s\nsurface, Kant argued that strangers do not have entitlements to settle\non foreign territory without the inhabitants\u2019 agreement. Thus,\ncosmopolitan right justifies visiting a foreign land, but not\nconquering it, which Kant criticized the commercial states of his day\nto have done in \u201cAmerica, the negro countries, the Spice\nIslands, the Cape\u201d and East India (1784 [1991: 106]).\n\nKant\u2019s views on the desirability of world government were\nclearly complex (Kokaz 2005: 87\u201392; Pogge 2009). On the one\nhand, Kant provides two of the most trenchant objections to world\ngovernment. The tyranny argument posits that world government\nwould descend into a global tyranny, hindering rather than enhancing\nthe ideal of human autonomy (Kant 1795 [1991]). Instead of delivering\nimpartial global justice and peace, a world government may form an\ninescapable tyranny that would have the power to make humanity serve\nits own interests, and opposition against which might engender\nincessant and intractable civil wars (Waltz 1979; DuFord 2017). In\nanother argument against its desirability, the inevitable remoteness\nof a global political authority would dilute the laws, making them\nineffectual and meaningless. The posited weakness of world government\nleads to objections based on its potential inefficiency and\nsoullessness (Kant 1795 [1991]).\n\nOn the other hand, Kant also provides a republican vision of world\ngovernment based on universal reason. His endorsement of the ideal of\nhuman unity prompted him to see a world republic, under which free and\nequal individuals, united by one global sovereign, would achieve a\n\u201cfully juridical condition\u201d (Pogge 2009: 198), as the\nideal end of the progress of human history. At the same time,\nKant\u2019s faith in human unity through reason coexisted with his\nsubscription to a theory of racial hierarchy in human development, and\nhe came to be critical of the dominant modes of European expansionist\npolicies in world politics in the late eighteenth\ncentury\u2014through colonial wars, exploitation, and\nconquests\u2014as undermining the moral progress of Europeans (Valdez\n2019). More generally, Kant condemned any move towards a universal\nmonarchy, because a monarchy, in contrast to a republic, does not\nguarantee, but undermines, the freedom and equality of individuals.\nAlthough a world republic is Kant\u2019s ultimate political ideal, a\nuniversal despotic monarch that exercises power arbitrarily is\nequivalent to a global anarchic state of nature, which is his ultimate\ndystopia. In between lies his \u201crealistic utopia\u201d (Rawls\n1999: 11\u20136) consisting of a federation of free (republican)\nstates short of a world state. As Habermas has put it,\n\n\nThis weak conception of a voluntary association of states that are\nwilling to coexist peacefully while nevertheless retaining their\nsovereignty seemed to recommend itself as a transitional stage en\nroute to a world republic. (2010: 268)\n\n\nKant\u2019s work shows that even in the eighteenth century, debates\nabout world government were alive and well, including arguments by\nradical political cosmopolitans such as Anacharsis Cloots\n(Jean-Baptiste du Val-de-Grace, baron de Cloots, 1755\u20131794), who\nused social contract theory to advocate the abolition of the sovereign\nstates system in favor of a universal republic encompassing all\nhumanity (Kleingeld & Brown 2002). At the same time, philosophical\nprojects for perpetual peace in the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies were Eurocentric in adopting Europe as the centre of world\norder, in failing to recognize non-European peoples in equal standing,\nand in obscuring the global inequalities and injustices being\nestablished by European commercial enterprises and states (Pitts 2018:\n6\u20137).\n\nThe nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed revivals of proposals\nfor world government that were fueled by racialized theories of\nprogress that buttressed European-led colonial and imperial expansion\nover much of the world, technological developments in travel and\ncommunications, the rapid ascent of a global capitalist system, as\nwell as the devastating impact of wars fought with modern technology.\nTheories of \u201cscientific racism\u201d continued to pervade\nEuropean thought on world order:\n\n\nWhite supremacist visions of global governance circulated widely in\nthe Anglo-American world. (Bell 2018: 871)\n\n\nOne of the most prominent proponents of world order, H.G. Wells\n(1866\u20131946), envisaged in 1901 a \u201cNew Republic\u201d of\nAnglo-American dominance, and while he repudiated racial theories, his\nvision of a universal world state included a civilizing mission (Wells\n1902; Bell 2018: 870). The construction of racial and civilizational\nhierarchies, backed by military domination, meant that the inclusion\nof non-Europeans and non-whites, whether in imperial projects,\ncolonial civilizing missions, or later, in a system of formally\nindependent states embedded in a capitalist global economy, would be\nmarked by deep asymmetries and inequalities in standing, status,\nrights, burdens, and powers (Anghie 2005; Bell 2019; Getachew\n2019).\n\nIn the Second World War, after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and\nNagasaki, atomic scientists lobbied for the international control of\natomic energy as a main function of world federalist government.\nAlbert Einstein wrote in 1946 that technological developments had\nshrunk the planet, through increased economic interdependence and\nmutual vulnerability through weapons of mass destruction. Although his\nadherence to the idea of a world government to guarantee interstate\npeace preceded the development of nuclear weapons, Einstein\u2019s\nadvocacy gained momentum with the risk of nuclear annihilation:\n\n\nA world government must be created which is able to solve conflicts\nbetween nations by judicial decision. This government must be based on\na clear-cut constitution which is approved by the governments and\nnations and which gives it the sole disposition of offensive weapons.\n(1946 [1950: 132]; Nathan & Norden 1960)\n\n\nOrganizations such as the United World Federalists (UWF), established\nin 1947, called for the transformation of the United Nations into a\nuniversal federation of states with powers to control armaments. World\npeace required that states should give up their traditional\nunrestricted sovereign rights to amass weapons and wage war, and that\nthey should submit their disputes to authoritative international\ninstitutions of adjudication and enforcement; world peace would only\nbe achieved through the establishment of world law (Clark & Sohn\n1958/1960 [1962]).\n\nCalls for world government in the post-World War Two era implied a\ndeep suspicion about the sovereign state\u2019s potential as a\nvehicle for moral progress in world politics. Emery Reves\u2019\ninfluential The Anatomy of Peace, is a condemnation of the\nnation-state as a political institution: \u201cThe modern Bastille is\nthe nation-state, no matter whether the jailers are conservative,\nliberal or socialist\u201d (1945: 270). Echoing Rousseau, Reves\nargued that nation-states threaten human peace, justice and freedom,\nby diverting funds from important needs, prolonging a global climate\nof mistrust and fear, and creating a war machine that ultimately\nprecipitates actual war. The experience of the world wars thus made it\nespecially difficult to view states as agents of moral progress. David\nMitrany, perhaps motivated by such suspicions, bracketed the idea of a\nworld federation or world state, and focused on the role that \u201ca\nspreading web of international activities and agencies\u201d could\nplay in the pursuit of world integration and peace (1966: 38;\nTrachtman 2013).\n\nSome did not reject the nation-state per se, but only\nauthoritarian nondemocratic states as unfit partners for building a\npeaceful world order. The Atlantic Union Committee (AUC), formed in\n1949 by Clarence Streit, for example, called for a federal union of\ndemocratic states that would be the genesis of a\n\n\nfree world government, as nations are encouraged by example to\npractice the principles which would make them eligible for membership,\nnamely the principles of representative government and protection of\nindividual liberty by law. (1950, quoted in Baratta 2004: 470; for a\ncritique see Rosenboim 2017)\n\n\nIn the context of the Cold War (1945\u201389), however, the division\nof the world into two ideologically opposed camps\u2014led by the\nUnited States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\n(USSR)\u2014produced mutual distrust that pervaded the reception of\nall proposals for world government. Soviet opposition to all Western\nproposals as attempts to impose \u201cAmerican monopolistic\ncapitalism\u201d on the world (Goodman 1953: 234) made the world\nfederalist movement\u2019s goal of establishing a universal\nfederation infeasible. The Soviet leadership also condemned the\nAUC\u2019s proposal for an exclusive union of democracies as part of\nthe Cold War rivalry\u2014an attempt to strengthen the anti-communist\n(anti-Soviet) bloc.\n\nIn a distorted fashion, the Soviet Union became the historical\nmanifestation of socialist or communist thought. Socialist ideas can\nbe traced back to the French Revolution, but developed more fully as a\nresponse to negative aspects of the rapid growth of industry in the\nnineteenth century. At the same time that technological advancements\npromised great material progress, the changes they wrought in social\nand economic relations were not all positive. While the many workers,\nor \u201cproletarians\u201d, in new industrial factories worked\nunder terrible conditions for meager wages, the few factory owners,\n\u201cthe bourgeoisie\u201d or \u201ccapitalists\u201d, amassed\ngreat wealth and power. According to Karl Marx (1818\u20131883),\nhuman history is a history of struggles not between nations or states,\nbut between classes, created and destroyed by changing modes of\nproduction. The state as a centralized, coercive authority emerges\nunder social modes of production at a certain stage of development,\nand is only necessary in a class society as the coercive instrument of\nthe ruling class. The capitalist economic system, however, contains\nwithin it the seeds of its own destruction: capitalism necessitates\nthe creation of an ever-growing proletarian class, and a global\nrevolution by the proletariat will sweep away \u201cthe conditions\nfor the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally\u201d\n(Marx & Engels 1848 [1988: 75]). The state will fall along with\nthe fall of classes:\n\n\nThe society that will organize production on the basis of a free and\nequal association of the producers will put the whole machinery of\nstate where it will then belong: into the Museum of Antiquities, by\nthe side of the spinning wheel and the bronze axe. (Engels 1884 [1978:\n755])\n\n\nIn a communist vision, capitalism is a necessary but transitional and\nephemeral order of things; the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism\nby forces it unleashed itself is necessary to attain a new world\norder, \u201cin which the free development of each is the condition\nfor the free development of all\u201d (Marx & Engels 1848 [1988:\n75]). World peace and freedom as nondomination for all (Roberts 2017),\nincluding freedom from the \u201calienated\u201d or\n\u201cestranged\u201d labor (Marx 1844 [1978: 71\u201381]) produced\nunder capitalism, will be achieved through the transformation of a\ncapitalist to a communist social order:\n\n\nIn proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation\nvanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.\n(Marx & Engels 1848 [1988: 73])\n\n\nThe Russian revolutionary, V.I. Lenin (1870\u20131924), drew on Marx\nto argue that the proletarian class needed to seize the coercive\napparatus of the state to oppress the resisters and exploiters, the\nbourgeoisie, however, Lenin was committed to world revolution, and to\nthe view that the state is \u201cthe organ of class rule\u201d, and\nthat even the\n\n\nproletarian state will begin to wither away immediately after its\nvictory because the state is unnecessary and cannot exist in a society\nin which there are no class antagonisms. (Lenin 1918: 65)\n\n\nIn the context of the post-World War I world that witnessed the\ncollapse of empires as well as the fortification of others, buttressed\nby the League of Nations, Lenin\u2019s vision of a new communist\nworld order entailed an appeal to the colonized to mount\nanti-imperialist revolutions. This contrasted with U.S. President\nWoodrow Wilson\u2019s less radical interpretation of\nself-determination as good self-government, a formulation that was\nconsistent with the civilizing narrative based on racial hierarchies,\nand the continuation and extension of a colonial international order\n(Pedersen 2015).\n\nLater Soviet leaders and elites who rejected Western proposals for\nworld federation somewhat inconsistently envisaged the transcendence\nof nation-states and world capitalism, and the establishment of a\nworld socialist economy governed by a \u201cBolshevik World\nState\u201d (Goodman 1953: 231). In communist ideology, ultimately,\nbalance-of-power politics between states enjoying unrestricted\nsovereignty did not cause war; the real cause of war was capitalism.\nIn practice, the Soviet Union\u2019s internally and externally\nrepressive policies made a mockery of socialist ideals of a classless\nsociety, or a world of peaceful socialist republics, and the\ndisintegration of the Soviet Union itself spelled the practical end of\none alternative to a capitalist world order.\n\nThe end of Cold War ideological divisions led some to have great\nexpectations in the 1990s of enhanced global cooperation to rid\nhumanity of the threat of global nuclear annihilation and to increase\nglobal commerce and spread prosperity, the material bases for building\na truly global moral and political community of humankind. The end of\nthe twentieth century was marked by an unbridled faith and optimism in\nthe inexorable twin triumph of capitalism and liberal democracy as the\nend of history (Fukuyama 1992). With the collapse of Soviet-style\nstate socialism, the world witnessed neoliberal transformations on a\nglobal scale, driven by the \u201cideology of free markets, trade\nliberalization, deregulation, and the small state\u201d (L\u00fcthi\n2020: 596). Quinn Slobodian has described the paradoxical ascendancy\nof \u201cglobalist\u201d neoliberalism, entailing the development of\na world state and regulatory laws that privileged the\n\u201cencasement\u201d of markets from domestic democratic\nregulation and accountability, leading to an institutional project to\nredesign \u201cstates, laws, and other institutions to protect the\nmarket\u201d (2018: 4 and 6). As neoliberalism spread on a global\nscale, so did the deterioration of conditions for robust democratic\npolitics, precipitating serious backsliding of democratization.\n\nThe optimism of the 1990s and early 2000s was thus short-lived as a\nvariety of persistent and deepening structural injustices of the\nmodern international system produced conditions ripe for violent\nconflict and mass atrocities, the global war on terror after 2001, the\nglobal financial crisis of 2007\u20139, growing numbers of displaced\npeople, rising socioeconomic inequality, and the hollowing out of\nsocial welfare protections, not to mention the disruptive consequences\nwrought by climate change, and the Covid-19 global pandemic. The\npersistence of racial subordination and gender inequalities, as well\nas the ascendancy of a neoliberal world order, have provoked much\ncritical debate about how these and other dominating hierarchies,\nbacked by powerful international institutions, law, states, and\ncorporations, can be tamed or overthrown, or how the crises they\ngenerate may accelerate structural transformations at the global level\nin a more emancipatory direction.\n",
