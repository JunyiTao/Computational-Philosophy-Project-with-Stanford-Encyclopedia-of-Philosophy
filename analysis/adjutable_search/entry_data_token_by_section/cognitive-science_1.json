    "main_text": "Methods\n2. Methods\n\nCognitive science has unifying theoretical ideas, but we have to\nappreciate the diversity of outlooks and methods that researchers in\ndifferent fields bring to the study of mind and intelligence. Although\ncognitive psychologists today often engage in theorizing and\ncomputational modeling, their primary method is experimentation with\nhuman participants. People, often undergraduates satisfying course\nrequirements, are brought into the laboratory so that different kinds\nof thinking can be studied under controlled conditions. For example,\npsychologists have experimentally examined the kinds of mistakes\npeople make in deductive reasoning, the ways that people form and\napply concepts, the speed of people thinking with mental images, and\nthe performance of people solving problems using analogies. Our\nconclusions about how the mind works must be based on more than\n\u201ccommon sense\u201d and introspection, since these can give a\nmisleading picture of mental operations, many of which are not\nconsciously accessible. Increasingly, psychologists draw their\nexperimental participants from Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk and from\nculturally diverse sources. Psychological experiments that carefully\napproach mental operations from diverse directions are therefore\ncrucial for cognitive science to be scientific. Experimentation is\nalso a methodology employed by\n experimental philosophy.\n\n\nAlthough theory without experiment is empty, experiment without theory\nis blind. To address the crucial questions about the nature of mind,\nthe psychological experiments need to be interpretable within a\ntheoretical framework that postulates mental representations and\nprocedures. One of the best ways of developing theoretical frameworks\nis by forming and testing computational models intended to be\nanalogous to mental operations. To complement psychological\nexperiments on deductive reasoning, concept formation, mental imagery,\nand analogical problem solving, researchers have developed\ncomputational models that simulate aspects of human performance.\nDesigning, building, and experimenting with computational models is\nthe central method of artificial intelligence (AI), the branch of\ncomputer science concerned with intelligent systems. Ideally in\ncognitive science, computational models and psychological\nexperimentation go hand in hand, but much important work in AI has\nexamined the power of different approaches to knowledge representation\nin relative isolation from experimental psychology.\n\nWhile some linguists do psychological experiments or develop\ncomputational models, most currently use different methods. For\nlinguists in the Chomskian tradition, the main theoretical task is to\nidentify grammatical principles that provide the basic structure of\nhuman languages. Identification takes place by noticing subtle\ndifferences between grammatical and ungrammatical utterances. In\nEnglish, for example, the sentences \u201cShe hit the ball\u201d and\n\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d are grammatical, but \u201cShe the\nhit ball\u201d and \u201cWhat does you like?\u201d are not. A\ngrammar of English will explain why the former are acceptable but not\nthe latter. An alternative approach, cognitive linguistics, puts less\nemphasis on syntax and more on semantics and concepts.\n\nLike cognitive psychologists, neuroscientists often perform controlled\nexperiments, but their observations are very different, since\nneuroscientists are concerned directly with the nature of the brain.\nWith nonhuman subjects, researchers can insert electrodes and record\nthe firing of individual neurons. With humans for whom this technique\nwould be too invasive, it is now common to use magnetic and positron\nscanning devices to observe what is happening in different parts of\nthe brain while people are doing various mental tasks. For example,\nbrain scans have identified the regions of the brain involved in\nmental imagery and word interpretation. Additional evidence about\nbrain functioning is gathered by observing the performance of people\nwhose brains have been damaged in identifiable ways. A stroke, for\nexample, in a part of the brain dedicated to language can produce\ndeficits such as the inability to utter sentences. Like cognitive\npsychology, neuroscience is often theoretical as well as experimental,\nand theory development is frequently aided by developing computational\nmodels of the behavior of groups of neurons.\n\nCognitive anthropology expands the examination of human thinking to\nconsider how thought works in different cultural settings. The study\nof mind should obviously not be restricted to how English speakers\nthink but should consider possible differences in modes of thinking\nacross cultures. Cognitive science is becoming increasingly aware of\nthe need to view the operations of mind in particular physical and\nsocial environments. For cultural anthropologists, the main method is\nethnography, which requires living and interacting with members of a\nculture to a sufficient extent that their social and cognitive systems\nbecome apparent. Cognitive anthropologists have investigated, for\nexample, the similarities and differences across cultures in words for\ncolors.\n\nTraditionally, philosophers do not perform systematic empirical\nobservations or construct computational models, although there has\nbeen a rise in work in experimental philosophy. But philosophy remains\nimportant to cognitive science because it deals with fundamental\nissues that underlie the experimental and computational approach to\nmind. Abstract questions such as the nature of representation and\ncomputation need not be addressed in the everyday practice of\npsychology or artificial intelligence, but they inevitably arise when\nresearchers think deeply about what they are doing. Philosophy also\ndeals with general questions such as the relation of mind and body and\nwith methodological questions such as the nature of explanations found\nin cognitive science. In addition, philosophy concerns itself with\nnormative questions about how people should think as well as with\ndescriptive ones about how they do. Besides the theoretical goal of\nunderstanding human thinking, cognitive science can have the practical\ngoal of improving it, which requires normative reflection on what we\nwant thinking to be. Philosophy of mind does not have a distinct\nmethod, but should share with the best theoretical work in other\nfields a concern with empirical results.\n\nIn its weakest form, cognitive science is just the sum of the fields\nmentioned: psychology, artificial intelligence, linguistics,\nneuroscience, anthropology, and philosophy. Interdisciplinary work\nbecomes much more interesting when there is theoretical and\nexperimental convergence on conclusions about the nature of mind. For\nexample, psychology and artificial intelligence can be combined\nthrough computational models of how people behave in experiments. The\nbest way to grasp the complexity of human thinking is to use multiple\nmethods, especially psychological and neurological experiments and\ncomputational models. Theoretically, the most fertile approach has\nbeen to understand the mind in terms of representation and\ncomputation.\n",
