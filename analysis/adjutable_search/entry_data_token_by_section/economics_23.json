Although the principles\nof rationality governing individual choice still apply, arguably there\nare further principles of rationality governing expectations of the\nactions of others (and of their expectations concerning your actions\nand expectations, and so forth). Game theory occupies an increasingly\nimportant role within economics, and it is also relevant both to\ninquiries concerning rationality and inquiries concerning ethics. For\nfurther discussion see the entries on\n game theory,\n game theory and ethics, and\n evolutionary game theory.\n",
