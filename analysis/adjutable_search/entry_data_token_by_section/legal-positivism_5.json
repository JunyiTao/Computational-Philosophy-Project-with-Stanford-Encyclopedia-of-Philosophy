    "main_text": "Law and Its Merits || The Separability Thesis\n4.2 The Separability Thesis\n\nAt one point, Hart identifies legal positivism with \n\n\nthe simple contention that it is no sense a necessary truth that laws\nreproduce or satisfy certain demands of morality, though in fact they\nhave often done so. (1961 [2012: 185\u2013186]) \n\n\nMany other philosophers, encouraged also by the title of Hart\u2019s\nfamous essay, \u201cPositivism and the Separation of Law and\nMorals\u201d, (1958) treat the theory as the denial that there is a\nnecessary connection between law and morality\u2014they must be in\nsome sense \u201cseparable\u201d even if not in fact separate\n(Coleman 1982). The separability thesis is generally construed so as\nto tolerate any contingent connection between morality and\nlaw, provided only that it is conceivable that the connection\nmight fail. Thus, the separability thesis is consistent with all of\nthe following: (i) moral principles may be part of the law; (ii) law\nis usually, or even always in fact, valuable; (iii) the best\nexplanation for the content of a society\u2019s laws includes\nreference to the moral ideals current in that society; and (iv) a\nlegal system cannot survive unless it is seen to be, and thus in some\nmeasure actually is, just. All four claims are counted by the\nseparability thesis as contingent connections only; they do not hold\nof all possible legal systems\u2014they probably don\u2019t\neven hold of all historical legal systems. As merely contingent\ntruths, it is said that they do not affect the concept of law itself.\nIf we think of the positivist thesis this way, we might interpret the\ndifference between exclusive and inclusive positivism in terms of the\nscope of the modal operator:\n\n(EP) It is necessarily\nthe case that there is no connection between law and\nmorality.\n(IP) It is not\nnecessarily the case that there is a connection between law and\nmorality.\n\n\nIn reality, however, legal positivism is not to be identified with\neither thesis: both are false. There are many necessary\n\u201cconnections\u201d, trivial and non-trivial, between law and\nmorality. As John Gardner notes, legal positivism takes a position on\nonly one of them; it rejects any dependence of the existence\nof law on its merits (Gardner 2001). And with respect to this\ndependency relation, legal positivists are concerned with much more\nthan the relationship between law and morality, for in the\nonly sense in which they insist on a separation of law and morals they\nmust insist also\u2014and for the same reasons\u2014on a separation\nof law and economics.\n\nTo exclude this dependency relation, however, is to leave intact many\nother interesting possibilities. For instance, it is possible that\nmoral value derives from the existence of law (Raz 1975\n[1990: 165\u2013170]). If Hobbes is right, any order is better than\nchaos and in some circumstances order may be achievable only through\npositive law. Or perhaps in a Hegelian way every existing legal system\nexpresses deliberate governance in a world otherwise dominated by\nchance; law is the spirit of the community come to self-consciousness.\nNotice that these claims are consistent with the fallibility thesis,\nfor they do not deny that these supposedly good things might also\nbring evils, such as too much order or the will to power. Perhaps such\nderivative connections between law and morality are thought innocuous\non the ground that they show more about human nature than they do\nabout the nature of law. The same cannot be said of the following\nnecessary connections between law and morality, each of which goes to\nthe heart of our concept of law (on which see further Green 2008):\n\n(1) Necessarily, law\ndeals with moral matters.\n\n\nKelsen writes, \n\n\nJust as natural and positive law govern the same subject-matter, and\nrelate, therefore, to the same norm-object, namely the mutual\nrelationships of men\u2014so both also have in common the universal\nform of this governance, namely obligation. (Kelsen 1928\n[1973: 34]) \n\n\nThis is a matter of the content of all legal systems. Where there is\nlaw there is also morality, and they regulate the same matters by\nanalogous techniques. Of course to say that law deals with\nmorality\u2019s subject matter is not to say that it does so well,\nand to say that all legal systems create obligations is not to endorse\nthe duties so created. This notion is distinct from Hart\u2019s\n\u201cminimum content\u201d thesis according to which there are\nbasic rules governing violence, property, fidelity, and kinship that\nany legal system must encompass if it aims at the survival of social\ncreatures like ourselves (Hart 1961 [2012: 193\u2013200]). Hart\nregards this as a matter of \u201cnatural necessity\u201d and in\nthat measure is willing to qualify his endorsement of the separability\nthesis. But even a society that prefers national glory or the worship\nof gods to survival will charge its legal system with the same tasks\nits morality pursues. Unlike the rules of a health club, law has broad\nscope and reaches to the most important things in any society,\nwhatever they may be. Indeed, our most urgent political worries about\nlaw and its claims flow from just this capacity to regulate our most\nvital interests, and law\u2019s wide reach must figure in any\nargument about its legitimacy. (A distinct argument, developed most\nfully by Raz (1994) and Gardner (2012a), is that law not only occupies\nitself with moral matters but makes moral claims\nover us. For criticism see Kramer 1999: 83\u20139; Duarte\nd\u2019Almeida and Edwards 2014.)\n\n(2) Necessarily, law is\njustice-apt.\n\n\nIn view of the normative function of law in creating and enforcing\nobligations and rights, it always makes sense to ask whether\nlaw is just, and where it is found deficient to demand reform. Legal\nsystems are therefore the kind of thing that is apt for\nappraisal as just or unjust. This is a significant feature of law. Not\nall human practices are justice-apt. It makes no sense to ask whether\na certain fugue is just or to demand that it become so. The musical\nstandards of fugal excellence are pre-eminently internal\u2014a good\nfugue is a good example of its genre; it should be melodic,\ninteresting, inventive etc.\u2014and the further we get from these\ninternal standards of excellence the more diverse evaluative judgments\nabout it become. While some formalists flirt with similar ideas about\nlaw, this seems inconsistent with law\u2019s place amongst human\npractices. Even if law has internal standards of merit\u2014virtues\nuniquely its own that inhere in its law-like character\u2014these\ncannot preclude or displace its assessment on independent criteria of\njustice. A fugue may be at its best when it has all the virtues of\nfugacity; but law is not best when it excels in legality; law\nmust also be just. A society may therefore suffer not only from too\nlittle of the rule of law, but also from too much of it. This does not\npresuppose that justice is the only, or even the first, virtue of a\nlegal system. It means that our concern for its justice as one of its\nvirtues cannot be side lined by any claim of the sort that law\u2019s\npurpose is to be law, to its most excellent degree. Law stands\ncontinuously exposed to demands for justification, and that too shapes\nits nature and role in our lives and culture.\n\n(3) Necessarily, law is\nmorally risky.\n\n\nIt is a curious fact that almost all theories that insist on the\nessentially moral character of law take law\u2019s character to be\nessentially good. The gravamen of Fuller\u2019s philosophy is that\nlaw is essentially a moral enterprise, made possible only by a robust\nadherence to its own inner morality. The thought that the law might\nhave an inner immorality never occurred to him. But, as Hart\nrecognized, where there is \u201ca union of primary and secondary\nrules\u201d\u2014that is to say, wherever there is law\u2014moral\nrisks emerge as a matter of necessity. There are not only newly\nefficient forms of oppression, unavailable in communities with more\ndiffuse forms of social organization, there are also new vices: the\npossible alienation of community and value, the loss of transparency,\nthe rise of a new hierarchy, and the possibility that some who should\nresist injustice may be bought off by the goods that legal order\nbrings. Although law has its virtues, it also necessarily risks\ncertain vices, and this marks a connection between law and morality of\na reverse kind.\n\nThese three theses establish connections between law and morality that\nare both necessary and highly significant. Each of them is consistent\nwith the positivist thesis that the existence and content of law\ndepends on social facts, not on the law\u2019s merits. Each of them\ncontributes to an understanding of the nature of law. The once-popular\nidea that legal positivism insists on the separability of law and\nmorality is therefore significantly mistaken.\n",
