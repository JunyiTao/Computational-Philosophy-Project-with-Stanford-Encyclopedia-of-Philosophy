    "main_text": "Yin-Yang \u9670\u967d Correlative Cosmology\n2. Yin-Yang \u9670\u967d Correlative Cosmology\n\nMen and women in Confucian philosophy are properly\n\u201cgendered\u201d when they are ritualized to embody a series of\nfamilial/social roles; their genderization is not derivative from a\nset of kinship-neutral inborn traits, as the way \u201cman\u201d or\n\u201cwoman\u201d as a conceptual category functions in the\ncontemporary western discourse. Nevertheless, the equivocation of\nyin/yang \u9670\u967d and femininity/masculinity has\nbecome a popular analytic entrance into the study of gender in\nConfucian philosophy. Numerous scholars have attributed gender\noppression and the misogynistic strains in Confucian philosophy to the\ncorrelation of yin with women and yang with men.\nDong Zhongshu\u2019s Luxurious Dews of the Spring and Autumn\n(Chunqiu fanlu; 2nd century BCE\ntext)\u2014especially Ch. 43: \u201cYang the Venerable,\nYin the Lowly\u201d and Ch. 53: \u201cBasic Meaning\u201d\nwhere one finds the exaltation of yang and the devaluation of\nyin\u2014is named as the culprit transforming the supposedly\nmore egalitarian, textual presentation of gender relations in the\npre-Han era to the decisively patriarchal bent of Han Confucianism\n(Csikszentmihalyi 2003: 163\u201364; R. Wang 2005; Pang-White 2018:\n8\u201310). On the flip side, the Daoist texts that consistently\nfavor yin over yang are said to suggest the\npossibility of a matriarchal past or at least a maternal matrix\n(Needham 1956: 105; Chen 1969: 401\u201305; Wawrytko 2000:\n163\u201398; Lee 2014: 57\u201377). Such theoretical postulation of\na matriarchal past based on the textual presence of a favorable\nyin over yang, however alluring, runs the risk of\nover-interpretation as well as the risk of oversimplification of the\nissue of gender relations as a matter of yin-yang\ncosmology.\n\nYin-yang\u2014as most prominently a Daoist concept, but also\nbroadly shared in many different schools of thought including\nConfucianism\u2014unlike the western oppositional binary of\nfemininity-masculinity, is not primarily, exclusively, nor invariably\na gender-based concept (Rubin 1982; Graham 1986; Black 1989). Rather,\nyin-yang\u2014that functions as an organizational cosmic\nschema\u2014is applicable to gender, but itself is cross-gender and\nbeyond gender. Yin and yang exist only in relation\nto one another internally as the way warmth-coldness only exist\nrelative to one another. Furthermore, when using yin-yang as\nan organizational schema, achieving balancing harmony is always the\ngoal, not domination nor subordination of one to the other. And hence\nyin-yang at its face value cannot even function as a\ntheoretical explanation for gender oppression where women are\nsubordinated to and dominated by men. The focus on the\nyin-yang cosmology yields little that is useful in the study\nof gender in Confucian philosophy.\n",
