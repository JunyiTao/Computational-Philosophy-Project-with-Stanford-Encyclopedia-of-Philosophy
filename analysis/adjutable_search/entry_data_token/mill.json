Life\n\nJohn Stuart Mill was born on 20 May 1806 in Pentonville, then a\nnorthern suburb of London, to Harriet Barrow and James Mill. James\nMill, a Scotsman, had been educated at Edinburgh\nUniversity\u2014taught by, amongst others, Dugald Stewart\u2014and\nhad moved to London in 1802, where he was to become a friend and\nprominent ally of Jeremy Bentham and the Philosophical Radicals.\nJohn\u2019s remarkable education, famously recounted in his\nAutobiography, was conducted with the intention of equipping\nhim for leadership of the next generation of radicalism. For this, at\nleast, it prepared him well. Starting with Greek at age three and\nLatin at age eight, Mill had absorbed most of the classical canon by\nage twelve\u2014along with algebra, Euclid, and the major Scottish\nand English historians. In his early teenage years, he studied\npolitical economy, logic, and calculus, utilising his spare time to\ndigest treatises on experimental science as an amusement. At age\nfifteen\u2014upon returning from a year-long trip to France, a nation\nhe would eventually call home\u2014he started work on the major\ntreatises of philosophy, psychology and government. All this was\nconducted under the strict daily supervision of his father\u2014with\nyoung John holding primary responsibility for the education of his\nsiblings (Reeves 2007: 11\u201327).\n\nThe intensity of study and weight of expectation took its toll. Mill\nhad internalised the radical and utilitarian creed during his\neducation\u2014a process capped off with a close reading of Bentham\nin Dumont\u2019s French translation and editorial responsibility for\nBentham\u2019s Rationale of Judicial Evidence\u2014and had\nbegun to put it into practise as a youthful propagandist. But he\nquickly found that his education had not prepared him for life. Mill\nsuffered, aged twenty, a \u201cmental crisis\u201d.\n\n\n[I]t occurred to me to put the question directly to myself:\n\u201cSuppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all\nthe changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward\nto, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a\ngreat joy and happiness to you?\u201d And an irrepressible\nself-consciousness distinctly answered, \u201cNo!\u201d [\u2026] I\nseemed to have nothing left to live for. (Autobiography, I:\n139).\n\n\nMill\u2019s malaise continued through 1826\u20137 (Capaldi 2004:\n55ff.). Though such episodes were to recur throughout his life, his\ninitial recovery was found in the poetry of the Romantics. A new side\ndeveloped to Mill\u2019s character, and he now emphasised the\nimportance of the culture of the feelings as well as the need for\nsocial reform. Mill particularly valued Wordsworth during this\nperiod\u2014though his new interests quickly led him to the work of\nColeridge, Carlyle, and Goethe. Mill\u2019s acquaintance with these\nthinkers gave him a lasting openness to Romantic thought\u2014and an\nacute awareness that the Enlightenment philosophy with which he had\nbeen brought up only contained \u201cone side of the truth\u201d\n(Autobiography, I: 169). His primary philosophic goal became,\nand would throughout his life remain, to integrate and reconcile these\nopposing schools of philosophy. \u201c[W]hoever could master the\npremises and combine the methods of both, would possess the entire\nEnglish philosophy of their age\u201d (Coleridge, X:\n121).\n\nThis new-found eclecticism also led to productive engagement with,\namongst others, Francois Guizot, Auguste Comte, and Tocqueville. All\nwould leave a lasting influence on Mill\u2019s work, but in this\nperiod, another figure also loomed large: Harriet Taylor (Kinzer 2007:\n77\u2013111). Mill met Harriet at a dinner party in 1830, and the two\nquickly fell in love. Harriet had, four years\u2019 prior, married\nJohn Taylor\u2014an amiable, though intellectually unadventurous,\npharmacist. The three eventually came to an arrangement by which Mill\nwould be allowed to visit Harriet at the Taylors\u2019 country\nretreat when her husband was not present, and at their London\nresidence while he visited his Club. This arrangement persisted for\nyears, and, by all accounts, Mill and Harriet\u2019s relationship was\nentirely platonic. John Taylor died in 1849, with Harriet and Mill\nmarrying in 1851\u2014though not before the perceived scandal had\ncaused a rift between Mill and many of his friends. Mill felt\nfirst-hand the stifling effect of Victorian judgmentalism and\noppressive norms of propriety\u2014a subject he would later take up\nin On Liberty.\n\nMill idolized Harriet, and credited her with virtual co-authorship of\nmany of his works. Untangling the influence she exerted upon\nMill\u2019s thought is complicated, precisely because the two worked\nso closely together on what would become many of Mill\u2019s central\nideas. She died, however, in 1858, while Mill and she were travelling\nthrough France. Harriet was buried in Avignon, where Mill subsequently\npurchased a house close by the cemetery, and lived for the rest of his\nlife. Mill inscribed on her grave that \n\n\n[s]he was the sole earthly delight of those who had the happiness to\nbelong to her. [\u2026] Were there but a few hearts and intellects\nlike hers this earth would already become the hoped-for heaven.\n\n\nHarriet\u2019s death, in fact, came only a little over a month after\nMill\u2019s retirement from the East India Company, for which he had\nworked for almost thirty-five years. Mill had taken a position as a\njunior clerk at aged seventeen, working directly under his father, who\nhad received the post on the basis of his authorship of A History\nof British India. John rose through the ranks, eventually holding\nthe position of Chief Examiner of Correspondence\u2014a position\nroughly equivalent to Undersecretary of State, involving managing\ndispatches for colonial administration (Zastoupil 1994). The job, Mill\nnoted, provided the stability of income needed for an author without\nindependent means, and was not so taxing as to prevent him exerting\nthe majority of his time and mental energy on his philosophical\npursuits. In 1865, he was elected as the Member of Parliament for\nWestminster for the Liberal Party. In keeping with his views on\ndistinction between representation and delegation, Mill declined to\nactively canvass for the seat\u2014indeed, he remained, for most of\nthe campaign, at his home in Avignon. While in the Commons, he\nchampioned what he perceived as unpopular but important causes: the\nextension of suffrage to women, Irish reform, and the prosecution of\nGovernor Eyre for atrocities committed during his administration of\nJamaica. He did not win a second term, being defeated by in 1868\n(Kinzer, Robson, and Robson 1992).\n\nMill, it might be noted, never held a university post\u2014nor did he\neven attend university himself\u2014except for the\n\u201chonorary\u201d position of Rector of the University of St\nAndrews. He was, throughout his life, a religious sceptic, having been\n\u201cbrought up from the first without any religious belief\u201d\n(Autobiography, I: 41; see also Matz 2017). He died in\nAvignon on 7 May 1873, and was buried next to his wife.\n2. Mill\u2019s Naturalism\n2.1 Anti a priorism\n\nMill\u2019s entire philosophical outlook is informed by a spirit of\nnaturalism (Skorupski 1989: 5ff.). It is not easy, however, to get a\nfoothold on this naturalism. Mill\u2019s general picture of mind and\nworld is established by appealing to what we are warranted in\nbelieving about the nature of those objects\u2014and hence relies on\na substantive account of knowledge. His account of knowledge, however,\ndraws upon his general picture of mind, world, and their\nrelation\u2014and therefore depends on a theory of what there is.\nThis circularity will be discussed in\n \u00a73.7.\n As an entry point into Mill\u2019s overall system for the purposes\nof exposition, however, we might simply note Mill\u2019s commitment\nto the claim that human beings are wholly part of nature, keeping in\nmind that Mill does not think of this as his unsupported starting\npoint, but itself a substantive claim.\n\nMill\u2019s belief that the mind is part of nature might usefully be\ncontrasted with those philosophers who hold that the mind has some\nexalted place in the order of things. Relevant contrasts are, for\ninstance, theists who hold that our minds have been given to us by an\nomnipotent and benevolent God for the purpose of comprehension, and\nidealists who hold that the mind has a formative role in constructing\nthe world. For such thinkers, a basic harmony between the architecture\nof mind and world might seem to be a given\u2014as such, if\nour experience could be found to take a certain form, then we\ncould infer facts about how the world must be composed. Mill rejects\nthis move.\n\n\nSuch an inference would only be warrantable, if we could know a\npriori that we must have been created capable of conceiving\nwhatever is capable of existing: that the universe of thought and that\nof reality, the Microcosm and the Macrocosm (as they were once called)\nmust have been framed in complete correspondence with one another\n[\u2026] but an assumption more destitute of evidence could scarcely\nbe made. (Examination, IX: 68)\n\n\nAs logically independent matters of fact, Mill thought there could be\nno seamless inference from the composition of our mind to how the rest\nof the world is, or must be. Mill holds, therefore, that there can be\nno genuine a priori knowledge of objective facts.\nMill\u2019s view that there are \u201cno truths cognizable by the\nmind\u2019s inward light, and grounded on intuitive evidence\u201d\n(Coleridge, X: 125) holds across the board. \n\n\nThe doctrine of a priori principles is one and the same\ndoctrine, whether applied to the \u1f42\u03bd or the\n\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd\u2014to the knowledge of truth or that of\nduty. (Whewell on Moral Philosophy, X: 171) \n\n\nAll genuine knowledge, then, whether theoretical or ethical, must be\nobtained by observation and experience.\n2.2 Associationism\n\nWe might call this Mill\u2019s anti apriorism about\nknowledge\u2014the view runs deep, giving an anthropological and\nempirical character to all of his philosophy. Mill adds to it a\npsychological account of the underlying mechanism by which we form\nideas. Here, he follows very much in the tradition of the British\nEmpiricists\u2014the theory being traced by Mill back to Hobbes,\nthrough Locke and Hartley, and to James Mill\u2019s publication of\nThe Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind\u2014in\nendorsing what has become known as associationist psychology:\n\u201cthe theory which resolves all the phenomena of the mind into\nideas of sensation connected together by the law of association\u201d\n(Blakey\u2019s History of Moral Science, X: 23).\n\nAll of our ideas and beliefs, Mill holds, have their origins in sense\nimpressions. Ideas or sensations which are either (i)\n\u201csimilar\u201d or (ii) \u201cfrequently experienced (or\nthought of) either simultaneously or in immediate succession\u201d,\ncome to be thought of together, and are eventually inseparably bound\ntogether in our mind, forming more complex ideas (System,\nVIII: 852; see Wilson 1990). The theory aims to derive even our most\nabstract ideas from experience\u2014\u201cPlace, Extension,\nSubstance, Cause, and the rest, are conceptions put together out of\nideas of sensation by the known laws of association\u201d\n(Examination, IX: 9)\u2014and thereby undermine the\nintuitionist\u2019s claim that such ideas are a priori.\n\nApparently a priori beliefs are subject to a similar\nundermining analysis. \n\n\nThere are innumerable cases of Belief for which no cause can be\nassigned, except that something has created so strong an association\nbetween two ideas that the person cannot separate them in thought.\n[\u2026] [T]his is one of the component and most fertile sources of\nerroneous thought. (Notes on the Analysis, XXXI: 161). \n\n\nTo give one of Mill\u2019s own examples, the apparently intuitive\nbelief that space is infinite is explained as in fact being wholly the\nresult of a process of association.\n\n\nWe have never perceived any object, or any portion of space, which had\nnot other space beyond it. And we have been perceiving objects and\nportions of space from the moment of birth. How then could the idea of\nan object, or of a portion of space, escape becoming inseparably\nassociated with the idea of additional space beyond? Every instant of\nour lives helps to rivet this association, and we never have had a\nsingle experience tending to disjoin it. (Examination, IX:\n82)\n\n\nFrom this process, we come to form the belief that space is infinite.\nBut, \n\n\nan association, however close, between two ideas, is not a sufficient\nground of belief; it is not evidence that the\ncorresponding facts are united in external nature. (Notes on the\nAnalysis, XXXI: 163) \n\n\nSuch beliefs must be tested by reasoning about what we ought\nto believe\u2014a process we shall investigate below, in\n \u00a73.2.\n3. Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy\n3.1 Philosophy of Language and Logic\n\nThough Mill holds that basic human thought is possible without\nlanguage, \u201cin complicated cases [it] can take place in no other\nway\u201d (System, VII: 19). As such, a study of human\nbeings\u2019 theoretical engagement with the world demands clarity on\nthis \u201cfundamental instrument of thought\u201d (System,\nVIII: 663; see also Losonsky 2006: 119\u201328). Mill\u2019s account\nof language turns upon a distinction between the denotation\nand connotation of a word. Words denote the objects\nwhich they are true of; they connote specific attributes of\nthose objects. The word \u201cman\u201d, for instance,\ndenotes, or is true of, all men\u2014\u201cPeter, Paul,\nJohn, and an indefinite number of other individuals\u201d\n(System, VII: 31). But it connotes the attributes in\nvirtue of which the word \u201cman\u201d applies to these\nindividuals\u2014\u201ccorporeity, animal life, rationality, and a\ncertain external form, which for distinction we call the human\u201d\n(System, VII: 31). Connotation determines denotation\nin the following sense: to know the connotation of a word is to know\nthe necessary and sufficient conditions to determine whether a given\nobject is denoted by that word.\n\nNot all words have connotation. Mill notes that words can be\nsingular or general. \u201cCicero\u201d is a\nsingular name\u2014applying to only one object, namely Cicero.\n\u201cRoman\u201d is, by contrast, a general name\u2014applying to\nmany objects, including Cicero but also Augustus, Nero, and many\nothers. While \u201call concrete general names are connotative\u201d\n(System, VII: 32)\u2014signaling the attributes which\njustify our application of the name to individual objects\u2014the\nsame cannot be said of singular names. To be sure, some\nsingular names are connotative\u2014\u201cthe author of De Re\nPublica\u201d is, as we would say, a definite description, and\npicks out one individual by way of signaling its attributes\u2014but\nnot all are. The name \u201cCicero\u201d does not connote any\nattributes at all\u2014but is a proper name, and serves simply as a\nmarker for that individual (Schwartz\n 2014).[1]\n\nThe analysis affords a simple means of determining the meaning of a\nvast range of simple propositions\u2014those portions of discourse\n\u201cin which one predicate is affirmed or denied of one\nsubject\u201d by way of a copula such as is, or is\nnot (System, VII: 81)\u2014and their composition into\nmore complex linguistic entities (Skorupski 1989: 178\u201392). The\nproposition S is P can be understood, in the case that\nP is a connoting term, as the claim that the object denoted\nby S has the attribute connoted by P. \u201cThe\nsummit of Chimborazo is white\u201d asserts a fact about the\nworld\u2014that the object denoted by the name \u201cthe summit of\nChimborazo\u201d has the attribute connoted by the name\n\u201cwhite\u201d (System, VII: 97). The proposition S\nis P, where P is a non-connoting term, can be understood\nas the claim that the object denoted by S is the same object\nas that denoted by P. \u201cTully is Cicero\u201d asserts\nmerely a fact about those names\u2014that the name\n\u201cTully\u201d is used to refer to the same object as the name\n\u201cCicero\u201d.\n\nThe difference is key. We learn nothing about the world when\nwe learn that \u201cTully is Cicero\u201d is true\u2014this\nproposition does not convey a fact about how things are, but\nrather about our own linguistic conventions of naming\n(System, VII: 110). The proposition is, in Mill\u2019s\nterminology, merely verbal. Such propositions are key to\nunderstanding the uninformative nature of a priori\npropositions and a priori reasoning. Mill, quite rightly,\ndoes not make the claim that a priori propositions such as\n\u201cevery man is a living creature\u201d are, like \u201cTully is\nCicero\u201d, assertions merely about our own conventions of naming.\nBut he does argue that such propositions share the feature of\nconveying no genuine information about the world. For the connotation\nof \u201cman\u201d\u2014the attributes it\nsignals\u2014includes the connotation of \u201cliving\ncreature\u201d. Someone who already knows the meaning of the term\n\u201cman\u201d is not told anything about how the world is\nwhen told that \u201cevery man is a living creature\u201d (Kroon\n2017: 214\u20136).\n\nDeductive or a priori reasoning, Mill thinks, is similarly\nempty. Predating the revolution in logic that the late\nnineteenth-century ushered in, Mill thinks of deductive reasoning\nprimarily in terms of the syllogism. Syllogistic reasoning, he argues\ncan elicit no new truths about how the world is: \u201cnothing ever\nwas, or can be proved by syllogism which was not known, or assumed to\nbe known, before\u201d (System, VII: 183).\n\n\nPremise 1: All men are mortal,\n\nPremise 2: Socrates is a man,\n\nConclusion: Socrates is mortal.\n\n\nIn standard syllogistic inferences, he argues, for arguments to be\nvalid, the conclusion must already have been asserted in the premises.\nBy way of example, in the above argument, the conclusion must already\nhave been asserted in the\n Premise 1\u2014the\n proposition that all men are mortal must be said to include\nthe proposition that Socrates is mortal if the argument is to be valid.\nNo new knowledge is therefore acquired in reasoning from premises to\nconclusion. The claim is perhaps more difficult to support than Mill\nappreciates, depending, as it does, upon equating of the meaning of a\nuniversal statement with the meaning of a conjunction of singular\nstatement (Fumerton 2017: 200). Nevertheless, Mill\u2019s argument\nthat we can learn nothing about the world by reflecting on our\nlanguage dovetails neatly with his naturalistic claim that all genuine\ncognitive advancement must take place by observation.\n\nThe suggestion that deductive reasoning cannot lead us to any new\nknowledge prompts two questions. Firstly, if not the advancement of\nknowledge, what is the function of syllogistic reasoning?\nAnd, secondly, what are we to say about apparently deductive reasoning\nwhich manifestly does lead us to new knowledge? To the first\nquestion, Mill answers that syllogistic reasoning allows us\n\u201ctest\u201d our commitment to general propositions\n(System, VII: 196). In making arguments such as the one\nabove, we cannot acquire new knowledge: for no facts beyond those\nwhich are in the premises are present in the conclusion. But the\nimplications of holding a general premise are more clearly displayed\nby the syllogistic reasoning, and this, in certain instances, may\ncause us to re-evaluate our commitment to that premise. To the second\nquestion, Mill holds that where we do gain genuinely new\nknowledge\u2014in cases of mathematics and geometry, for\ninstance\u2014we must, at some level, be reasoning\ninductively. Mill, that is to say, attempts to account for\nthe genuine informativeness of mathematical and geometric reasoning by\ndenying that they are in any real sense a priori. We shall\nreturn to this claim in\n \u00a73.4.\n3.2 Foundations of Theoretical Reason\n\nWe cannot acquire any genuine knowledge a priori, then. Mill\nholds that knowledge can be obtained only by empirical observation,\nand by reasoning which takes place on the ground of such observations.\nThis principle stands at the heart of his radical empiricism. Sense\nperceptions are the \u201coriginal data, or ultimate premises of our\nknowledge\u201d (System, VII: 7)\u2014knowledge of greater\nlevels of complexity is arrived at solely by inferences from that\noriginal data. And, as we shall see, Mill grants the validity of only\none kind of inference. \u201cInference, consequently all Proof, and\nall discovery of truths not self-evident, consists of inductions, and\nthe interpretation of inductions\u201d (System, VII:\n283).\n\n\nInduction properly so called [\u2026] may [\u2026] be summarily\ndefined as Generalization from Experience. It consists in inferring\nfrom some individual instances in which a phenomenon is observed to\noccur, that it occurs in all instances of a certain class; namely, in\nall which resemble the former, in what are regarded as the\nmaterial circumstances. (System, VII: 306)\n\n\nMill rightly notes that upon observing that x1,\nx2, x3, \u2026\nxn are P, human beings are disposed to form the\nbelief that some relevantly similar xn+1 is P.\nUpon seeing ten swans, all white, for instance, we tend to believe\nthat an eleventh unseen swan is also white. But, Mill holds, such\ninferences are not something we are merely disposed to\nbelieve, but something we have reason to\nbelieve\u2014inferences of this general form are warranted.\nThe question arises, of course, how it is that we can be warranted in\nbelieving the results of induction prior to their confirmation or\ndisconfirmation\u2014how it comes to be that we can be\njustified in believing an inductively suggested\nconclusion.\n\nMill offers two answers to this question. The first, we might term his\niterative validation of induction. We are warranted in\nbelieving enumerative inductions, Mill thinks, because \u201c[t]he\nuniverse, so far as known to us, is so constituted, that whatever is\ntrue in any one case, is true in all cases of a certain\ndescription\u201d (System, VII: 306). This uniformity of\nnature, however, is something we do not, and could not, know a\npriori, but only itself as \u201cas an instance of\ninduction\u201d (System, VII: 307). We know, in other words,\nby an act of induction, that inductive generalizations tend\nto be true, and that induction is therefore a good way of reasoning.\nInduction is, in this sense, self-supporting.\n\nOf course, this justification is circular, as Mill realizes. If we are\nwarranted in believing that induction is in general a good way of\nreasoning only to the extent that our past inductions are themselves\ntaken to have been good inferences, then the question remains how\nthose inductions can be warranted forms of inference (cf. \nFumerton 2009: 167\u20138). Mill\u2019s second answer,\nwhich we might term his initiating validation of induction,\naddresses this issue. \n\n\nMany of the uniformities existing among phenomena are so constant, and\nso open to observation, as to force themselves upon involuntary\nrecognition. (System, VII: 318) \n\n\nWe are, Mill claims, naturally inclined to reason inductively, and\nupon critical inspection, acts of induction strike us as\n\u201cdeserving of reliance\u201d (System, VII: 319). We\nadopt induction \u201cspontaneously\u201d as a method of\nreasoning\u2014and under free consideration, it seems to us\nreasonable to do so (System, VII: 317).\n\nThis initiating validation of the principle of induction is directly\nparallel to Mill\u2019s argument for the principle of utility\n(Macleod 2014). We are naturally inclined to desire pleasure, and such\ndesires, when we attend to them, strike us as reasonable\u2014as\nbeing desire-worthy. Similarly, we are naturally disposed to\nbelieve in inductive generalisations, and such beliefs, when we attend\nto them, strike us as reasonable\u2014being belief-worthy.\nIn each case, there is no further initial justification of our natural\nreasoning propensities beyond the fact that, upon critical inspection,\nthey strike us as sound. Indeed, that valid principles of\nreason\u2014practical and theoretical\u2014are established by\ncasting a critical eye upon how we in fact do reason should\nbe of no surprise: such an anthropological approach to the normative\nis forced by Mill\u2019s naturalism. We cannot know what constitutes\ngood reasoning a priori, and as such \u201c[t]he laws of our\nrational faculty, like those of every other natural agency, are only\nlearnt by seeing the agent at work\u201d (System, VII:\n833).\n\nThe evidence provided by critically examining our natural modes of\nreasoning is of course defeasible\u2014as in the case of the\n\u2018proof\u2019 of the principle of utility, the initiating\nvalidation is not a proof in the traditional deductive sense. But the\njustification provided is real nevertheless. And from here, iterative\nvalidation can increase our confidence that we are warranted in\nreasoning inductively: further inductions ranging over inductions can\nimprove our reasoning abilities by establishing in more and more\nprecise ways the circumstances in which inductive moves are good ones\nto make. Indeed, this process of sharpening inductive reasoning by\n\u201culterior revision of [\u2026] spontaneous\ngeneralizations\u201d (System, VII: 319) is, as we shall\nsee, the very heart of the process of scientific thinking.\n\nAs noted above, Mill claims not only that enumerative induction is\na valid principle, but that it is the sole principle\nby which we are justified in inferring unobserved facts about the\nworld.\n [2]\n In particular, he rejects the independent validity of the\n\u201cHypothetical Method\u201d\u2014what has come to be known as\ninference to the best explanation (System, VII: 492). We are\nnot entitled, that is to say, to believe in something\nunobserved solely on the basis that it explains the\nobserved facts (Skorupski 1989: 197\u2013202; see also\nMacleod 2016; Jacobs 1991). A hypothesis \n\n\nis not to be received probably true because it accounts for all the\nknown phenomena; since this is a condition sometimes fulfilled\ntolerably well by two conflicting hypotheses. (System, VII:\n500) \n\n\nThis is not to deny the role of hypothesis in investigation\naltogether, however. Mill claims that hypotheses about unobserved\nentities made in an effort to explain empirical observations can\nprovide useful suggestions, but that entitlement to believe\ncan only be provided by reasoning based on the principle of\nenumerative induction. \n\n\n[H]ypothesis, by suggesting observations and experiments, puts us on\nthe road to that independent evidence if it be really\nattainable. (System, VII: 496, my emphasis)\n\n3.3 Sharpening Reason: Philosophy of Science\n\nAll genuine inferential knowledge we have of the world, then, is\njustified by the use of simple enumerative induction\u2014this is\n\u201cfree-standing and the sole load-bearing structure in\nMill\u2019s logic\u201d (Godden 2017: 175). The reasoning that\ntakes place in our scientific engagement with the world, Mill holds,\nis simply the application of a particularly refined version of such\nenumerative induction. \n\n\n[T]he most scientific proceeding can be no more than an improved form\nof that which was primitively pursued by the human understanding while\nundirected by science. (System, VII: 318) \n\n\nImprovement to inductive methodology comes by theoretical\nreason\u2019s reflective self-examination\u2014inductive\nconsideration of induction itself.\n\n\nExperience testifies, that among the uniformities which it exhibits or\nseems to exhibit, some are more to be relied on than others [\u2026]\nThis mode of correcting one generalization by means of another, a\nnarrower generalization by a wider, which common sense suggests and\nadopts in practice, is the real type of scientific Induction.\n(System, VII: 319)\n\n\nThe history of science, as Mill sees it, is the history of the growth\nof our knowledge by inductive reason, but also the growth of\nour knowledge of inductive reason. As we learn more about the\nworld, induction becomes more and more established, and with this it\nbecomes self-critical and systematic.\n\n\u201c[W]e may discover, by mere observation without experiment, a\nreal uniformity in nature\u201d (System, VII: 386). Where\npossible, however, engaging in experimental activity is the most\ndirect way to uncover the causal relations between events, because it\nallows us to \u201cmeet with some of the antecedents apart from the\nrest, and observe what follows from them; or some of the consequents,\nand observe by what they are preceded\u201d (System, VII:\n381). Mill claims that, as science has progressed, four methods have\nemerged as successful in isolating causes of observed phenomena\n(System, VII: 388\u2013406; see Cobb 2017: 240\u20131). Firstly,\nthe Method of Agreement: where instances of phenomenon A are\nalways accompanied with phenomenon a, even when other\ncircumstances accompanying A are varied, we have reason to\nbelieve that A and a are causally related. Secondly, the\nMethod of Difference: where the only distinguishing feature marking\nsituations in which phenomenon a occurs or does not occur is\nthe presence or absence of phenomenon A, there is reason to\nthink that A is an indispensable part of the cause of a.\n(If we have noted, via the Method of Agreement, that in all instances\nof A, a is present, we can, where possible,\nsystematically withdraw A, to determine whether A is a\ncause of a by the Method of Difference. Mill terms this the\nJoint Method of Agreement and Difference.) Thirdly, the Method of\nResidues: against the knowledge that A is the cause of\na, and B the cause of b, where ABC\ncauses abc, and AB causes merely ab, we can\n(by ruling out that c is the joint effect of AB)\nregard C as the cause of c. Fourthly, the Method of\nConcomitant Variations: whenever a varies when A varies\nin some particular manner, a may be thought to be causally\nconnected to A.\n\nSuch methods must, of course, be applied cautiously\u2014the\nexistence of background conditions makes it difficult to say with\ncertainty that any individual phenomenon is in fact the causally\nactive agent\u2014and results will always be provisional, and open to\nfurther correction (Ducheyne 2008). But by carefully varying\nconditions, Mill holds, we can isolate causes and reveal the laws\nwhich govern natural phenomena. We learn first to explain individual\nevents by showing that they are instances of known causal laws, and\nthen \u201cin a similar manner, a law or uniformity in nature is said\nto be explained, when another law or laws are pointed out, of which\nthat law itself is but a case\u201d (System, VII: 464). By\ncontinued application of the Canons of Induction, the most general\nLaws of Nature can be ascertained\u2014this is the ultimate goal of\nscience. Mill adopts a Humean account of such laws as regularities:\n\u201cThe expression, Laws of Nature, means nothing but the\nuniformities which exist among natural phenomena\u201d\n(System, VII: 318). Nevertheless, he thinks that science\nreveals the deep structure of the world\u2014how things genuinely\nare.\n\n\nKepler did not put what he had conceived into the facts, but\nsaw it in them. A conception implies, and corresponds to,\nsomething conceived: and though the conception itself is not in the\nfacts, but in our mind, yet if it is to convey any knowledge relating\nto them, it must be a conception of something which really is\nin the facts, some property which they actually possess, and which\nthey would manifest to our senses, if our senses were able to take\ncognizance of it. (System, VII: 295; cf. System,\nVII: 651)\n\n\nMill\u2019s insistence that the process of science involves finding\nthe structure already present in nature gives his philosophy\na realist orientation. Perhaps the clearest instance of such realism\nin his work, however, is the claim that \u201cKinds have a real\nexistence in nature\u201d (System, VII: 122). Scientific\nanalysis of nature, Mill holds, uncovers a \u201cradical distinction\nin the things themselves\u201d (System, VII: 123). \n\n\nIn so far as a natural classification is grounded on real Kinds, its\ngroups are certainly not conventional; it is perfectly true that they\ndo not depend upon an arbitrary choice of the naturalist.\n(System, VIII: 720) \n\n\nSuch Kinds are marked not by the possession of some metaphysical\nessence\u2014but by their marking \u201can indeterminate multitude\nof properties not derivable from one another\u201d (System,\nVII: 126). Some groups of objects share characteristics because those\ncharacteristics are the very grounds of their being grouped\ntogether\u2014Real kinds share an unknown number of similarities\nbecause they have a shared nature. The notion is closely, though not\nunproblematically, related to the modern notion of a Natural Kind\n(Magnus 2015).\n\nBecause Mill\u2019s naturalism commits him to the principle that\n\u201c[t]he laws of our rational faculty [\u2026] are only learnt\nby seeing the agent at work\u201d, the investigation of scientific\nmethodology pursued in the System of Logic takes the form of\na theoretical investigation of lessons learnt from the history of\nsuccessful scientific practice. It is perhaps odd, then, that Mill\nhimself was not a historian of science of any real depth. As a matter\nof biographical fact, Mill\u2019s knowledge of this topic was derived\nprincipally from secondary sources\u2014William Whewell\u2019s\nHistory of Inductive Science, John Herschel\u2019s\nDiscourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy and August\nComte\u2019s Cours de Positive Philosophie\u2014and the\nsections of the System which make significant appeal to the\nhistory of science were significantly indebted to the research\nconducted on his behalf by Alexander Bain (Autobiography, I:\n215\u20137, 255; Bain 1904: 137, 141). Had Mill been better\nacquainted with the history of actual scientific practice, it is\nquestionable whether he would have insisted that the story of\nscientific progress is simply the story of the steady use of\nobservation and induction\u2014whether the Canons of Induction really\nare exhaustive of the way in which scientific investigation\nhas enabled humans to obtain knowledge of the world. A detailed\nanthropological study of the history of successful scientific practice\nis likely to reveal the irreducible use of imaginative\nhypothesis-making\u2014not to mention changing questions and ideals\nof the sort later highlighted by Thomas Kuhn (1962). Such was the\nbasis for a telling historico-normative debate between Whewell and\nMill\u2014the former arguing that scientific reasoning had and should\ninvolve the creative a priori development of concepts prior\nto the discovery of laws, the latter claiming, as can be seen in the\nquote above, that observation and induction alone could track facts\nabout the world and elicit the concepts used in science (Snyder\n2006).\n3.4 Arithmetic, Geometry and Necessity\n\nAmongst the Laws of Nature learnt by way of inductive reasoning are\nthe laws of geometry and arithmetic. It is worth emphasizing that in\nno case does Mill think that the ultimately inductive nature of the\nsciences\u2014whether physical, mathematical, or\nsocial\u2014precludes the deductive organization and\npractice of the science (Ryan 1987: 3\u201320). Manifestly,\nwe do work through many inferences in deductive terms\u2014and this\nis nowhere clearer than in the case of mathematics. Mill\u2019s claim\nis simply that any premise or non-verbal inference can only be as\nstrong as the inductive justification that supports it.\n\nArithmetic, Mill holds, is at base non-verbal. That two plus one is\nequal to three is not \n\n\na definition of the word three; a statement that mankind have agreed\nto use the name three as a sign exactly equivalent to two and one; to\ncall by the former name whatever is called by the other more clumsy\nname. (System, VII: 253) \n\n\nIn contrast to many in the empiricist tradition\u2014including his\nfather\u2014Mill holds that mathematical propositions assert genuine\nfacts. \u201c[T]here is in every step of arithmetical or\nalgebraically calculation a real induction, a real inference of facts\nfrom facts\u201d (System, VII: 254). That we perform\noperations in a deductive manner in the following case:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n 2 \\times (2+1) & = 2 \\times 3\\\\\n & = 6\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nshould not obscure that the validity of each move is established by\ninduction. We establish that two plus one is equal to three by\ngeneralization from specific instances: that two pebbles and one\npebble together make three pebbles, that two horses and one horse\ntogether make three horses, and so on. So too other such arithmetic\nlaws. Of course, as is the case with our discovery of physical laws,\nthe laws which we learn first are, as the \u201cScience of\nNumber\u201d grows more sophisticated, subsumed as instances of more\nfundamental laws\u2014and can eventually be shown to follow from the\naxioms of mathematics (System, VII: 253, 608ff.).\n\nGeometrical propositions, too, are inferred from premises which\nthemselves have real content. Such premises\u2014that, for instance,\nwe can draw a straight line connecting any two single points\u2014are\nnot mere verbal propositions. Indeed, Mill claims, such premises are\nnot strictly even true of the real space we encounter in experience:\nneither perfectly single points, nor perfectly straight lines exist in\nnature. These are rather idealizations of that space\u2014but\nidealizations which are based on principles that could only be known\nby inductive generalization of our observations. The same holds for\nthe results of geometric reasoning (System, VII:\n 224ff.).[3]\n\nMill\u2019s account of mathematics is brief, and raises many issues.\nAmongst the most pressing questions pertain to the status of the\nobjects which mathematicians talk about. The Platonist can\ncharacterize the claims of mathematics as claims about abstract\nobjects\u2014but, as a naturalist, no such option is open to Mill.\n\u201cAll numbers must be numbers of something: there are no such\nthings as numbers in the abstract\u201d (System, VII: 254).\nSimilarly, there are no real objects corresponding to the definitions\nof geometry (System, VII: 225). Mill, rather, claims that\nnumbers are properties of aggregates and as such denote aggregates\nwith those properties, and takes geometrical objects to be limit cases\nof real world objects (System, VII: 610\u20131,\n226\u20139). More, however, needs to be said about the referents of\nthe entities appealed to in the higher regions of\nmathematics\u2014higher order sets, imaginary numbers, the\ntransfinites\u2014as well as how to construe \u2018limit\ncases\u2019 naturalistically (Shapiro 2000: 91\u2013102,\n226\u201356; Kitcher 1998). One can, perhaps, take mathematical\nobjects to be fictions (Balaguer 2014)\u2014but specifying how such\nfictions can be subject to constrained standards of truth and falsity\nremains difficult.\n\nThat Mill holds that even mathematics is founded upon\ninductive reasoning is perhaps most interesting because it\ndemonstrates the radical and thoroughgoing nature of his empiricism.\nIndeed, Mill saw this aspect of his work in just this\nway\u2014combatting the a priori and intuitionist school by\n\u201cdriv[ing] it from its stronghold\u201d\n(Autobiography, I: 233). Mill\u2019s denial of the a\npriori status of mathematical propositions, of course, challenges\nthe commonplace idea that, when true, such propositions are true\nnecessarily. Indeed, the rejection of the possibility of\na priori knowledge as such challenges the notion that there\nare any necessary truths. Mill does not shy away from this\nimplication. Truths can be better or worse established\u2014central\nor peripheral to our understanding of the world\u2014and we can\ntherefore be more or less willing to abandon them. But Mill shows\nlittle interest in principled or absolute modal distinctions between\nnecessary and contingent truths. Rather, Mill argues, some\npropositions seem to us necessary because of processes of\npsychological association make them so ingrained that their denial\nseems to us inconceivable.\n3.5 The Mind in the World: Psychology, Ethology, and Freedom\n\nAs was noted above\n (\u00a72.1),\n Mill\u2019s naturalism involves the claim that human beings and\ntheir minds are wholly a part of nature. As such, they are subject to\ncausal laws in just the same manner as the rest of natural\nworld\u2014empirical study of the mind, Mill holds, reveals that it\nis governed by the laws of associationistic psychology. Mill\u2019s\nassociationism differs in key respects from that of his\npredecessors\u2014he shows more concern to do justice to the\nspontaneity of mind (Bain\u2019s Psychology, XI: 335), the\nworld-directed nature of representational thought (Notes on the\nAnalysis, XXXI: 413), and the fact that some complex ideas cannot\nbe accounted for in terms of the mechanical combination of simple\nideas present in sense experience (System, VIII:\n852\u20136). Such modifications of his associationistic inheritance\nwere, in part, a reaction to points made by the Germano-Coleridgean\nschool. His account, nevertheless, remains firmly within the tradition\nof British empiricism\u2014and he never wavers from a commitment to\nthe claim that our mental life is governed by causal laws operating in\na deterministic fashion. Indeed, Mill holds out hope that our\nunderstanding of such laws will improve\u2014and even shows interest\nin the promise of understanding the \u201cmaterial conditions\u201d\nof thought in the brain and nervous system (Bain\u2019s\nPsychology, XI: 348).\n\nThe character of the mind of an individual, Mill holds, is a function\nentirely of the experiences that individual has undergone. In this\nsense, Mill holds firm to the eighteenth-century empiricists\u2019\ndoctrine of the tabula rasa. In Mill\u2019s hands, however,\nit becomes transformed into a characteristically nineteenth-century\nclaim that human nature itself is malleable (Mandelbaum 1971: 141ff.).\nSpecific experiences, to be sure, write their lessons on our\nminds\u2014but background conditions, which differ from culture to\nculture, play an equally important role. Such acculturation affects\nthe characters, desires, and dispositions of human beings, which vary\nradically depending on the setting of human beings\u2014a point noted\nby many of Mill\u2019s romantic contemporaries, and one which\ninfluenced the direction of his utilitarianism. Human nature exhibits\n\u201castonishingly pliability\u201d (Civilization, XVIII:\n145). \n\n\n[I]f there are some tendencies of human nature [\u2026] which are\nthe same in all ages and countries, these never form the whole of the\ntendencies. (Spirit of the Age, XXII: 256\u20137) \n\n\nBut it also affects our beliefs and our modes of perceiving the world.\nAs Mill notes,\n\n\nA great part of what seems observation is really inference [\u2026]\nFor in almost every act of our perceiving faculties, observation and\ninferences are intimately blended. What we are said to observe is\nusually a compound result, of which one-tenth may be observation, and\nthe remaining nine-tenths inference. (System, VIII:\n641\u20132)\n\n\nWhat are properly inferences from our observations come by processes\nof association to seem as observations themselves. I observe,\nproperly, only a certain sensory manifold, and infer that this is my\nbrother\u2014but, with repetition, the inference becomes merged by\nassociation with the observation, and I take the inferred content to\nbe part of the observation itself. Processes of association, that is\nto say, renders our observations deeply theory laden. And the theories\nwith which they are laden, of course, will vary with social\nsetting.\n\nThe systematic science treating the topic of how upbringing and\nenvironment affect the formation of individuals, Mill terms\n\u201cethology\u201d (System, VIII: 861). Such a science,\nwhich would utilize the principles of psychology to allow us to\ndetermine the conditions most conducive or damaging to the production\nof characters we think desirable, \u201cis still to be created\u201d\n(System, VIII: 872\u20133). Nevertheless, much of\nMill\u2019s work can be seen as an attempt to start such a research\nprogramme, charting the effects of social conditions on the creation\nof character\u2014his own character in the Autobiography,\nthat of women in the Subjection, and those of democratic\nsocieties in On Liberty (Ball 2010).\n\nIndividuals\u2019 characters are the result of causal\nprocesses\u2014and such characters determine their actions. \n\n\nNo one who believed that he knew thoroughly the circumstances of any\ncase, and the characters of the different persons concerned, would\nhesitate to foretell how all of them would act. (System,\nVIII: 837) \n\n\nGiven that individuals are subject to such laws, there is\nlittle reason to think that the societies composed of\nindividuals will not be subject to natural laws (System,\nVIII: 879). And, indeed, Mill thinks it possible to specify laws by\nwhich societies evolve from the state of barbarism to\ncivilization\u2014\u201claws which regulate the succession between\none state of society and another\u201d (System, VIII:\n912)\u2014and chart, scientifically, the process of history (Levin\n2004; see also Macleod 2017). \u201cThe order of human\nprogress\u201d is guided with \u201ca sort of necessity established\n[\u2026] by the general laws of human nature\u201d\n(System, VIII: 938).\n\nUnderstanding the human world scientifically\u2014understanding it as\npart of the natural world\u2014of course puts pressure on\nthe notion that human beings are in any real sense free. Mill is clear\nthat human actions could be \u201cunerringly inferred\u201d if their\nantecedents were known, but nevertheless maintains that this\ndeterministic stance does not \u201cconflict in the smallest degree\nwith what is called our feeling of freedom\u201d (System,\nVIII: 837). Our actions are causally determined, but nevertheless,\nMill maintains, we are free (Ryan 1987: 103\u2013131). Mill adopts a\ncompatibilist account of human freedom. Although it is true that our\ncharacter and desires, in combination with a set of circumstances,\ncausally necessitates some particular action, it is not true\nthat if that person had some alternative character and set of\ndesires that that same cause would necessitate that same action. Had\nthat person had different desires, or a different character, he might\nwell have acted differently. This, Mill concedes, would be of little\nconsolation if our character and desires are beyond the control of an\nindividual to influence. But, he points out, we can influence\nour character and desires. We can place ourselves in circumstances\nthat modify our character, and we can practice better habits. \n\n\n[I]f we examine closely, we shall find that this feeling, of our being\nable to modify our own character if we wish, is itself the\nfeeling of moral freedom which we are conscious of. (System,\nVIII: 841)\n\n3.6 The World in the Mind: the Relativity of Knowledge and Mill\u2019s Idealism\n\nAs we have seen, Mill holds that \u201ca great part of what seems\nobservation is really inference\u201d (System, VIII: 641).\nThe raw content of experience is itself extremely narrow\u2014indeed,\nMill holds, we directly perceive only our own internal impressions.\n\u201cFrom my senses, I have only the sensations\u201d\n(System, VIII: 643). The claim is a strong one\u2014that\nwhat is directly present to the mind are not external objects, but\nonly \u201ca set of appearances\u201d (System, VIII: 783).\nWe have unmediated access only to the impression that are generated in\nus\u2014we are directly aware only of our own mental content.\n\nWe know of objects in the world only to the extent that they affect us\nand give rise to conscious impressions\u2014and such impressions will\nonly ever be presented by way of the mediating sense faculties. Mill\nclaims that we cannot know anything of objects in themselves, but only\nas they appear to us, and terms this position the \u201cRelativity of\nHuman Knowledge\u201d (Examination, IX: 4). \n\n\n[A]ll the attributes which we ascribe to objects, consist in their\nhaving the power of exciting one or another variety of sensation in\nour mind [\u2026] our knowledge of objects [\u2026] consist[s] of\nnothing but the sensations which they excite. (Examination,\nIX: 6) \n\n\nOur theoretical engagement with the world is always mediated by our\nconditioning faculties\u2014and as such our representations of the\nworld are always representations of what the world is like for beings\nsuch as ourselves.\n\nMill calls this insight \u201cone of great weight and significance,\nwhich impresses a character on the whole mode of philosophical\nthinking of whoever receives it\u201d (Examination, IX: 11).\nThe doctrine ultimately pushes Mill towards Idealism. One might hold\nthat, though we are only familiar in experience with mental\nimpressions, we can nevertheless infer the existence of non-mental\nobjects lying behind such mental objects. But such an\ninference could not be supported within experience by enumerative\ninduction\u2014no non-mental objects are ever observed behind mental\nobjects\u2014but only by a hypothesis to some unobserved entity. As\nwas noted above, however, Mill rejects the method of hypothesis as an\nautonomous form of reasoning\u2014no such inference to unobserved\nnon-mental objects could for him be valid. Mill is forced towards the\nconclusion that we can have no warrant for believing in non-mental\nentities.\n\nAll that can be established inductively is that a certain class of\nobjects of sensation are stable\u2014that they can be returned to,\nafter durations in which they go unperceived. Such, Mill thinks, is\nthe true content of our notion of the external world.\n\n\nMatter, then, may be defined, a Permanent Possibility of Sensation. If\nI am asked, whether I believe in matter, I ask whether the questioner\naccepts this definition of it. If he does, I believe in matter: and so\ndo all Berkeleians. In any other sense than this, I do not.\n(Examination, IX: 183)\n\n\nThe idea of an external world is not present in the content\nof experience. Rather, our idea of externality is derived from the\nrecognition that certain sensations can be revisited: that \n\n\nthough I have ceased to see it [\u2026] I believe that when I again\nplace myself in the circumstances in which I had those sensations\n[\u2026] I shall again have them; and further, that there is no\nintervening moment at which this would not have been the case.\n(Examination, IX: 179) \n\n\nOur idea of matter is exhausted by the idea of \n\n\nsomething which exists when we are not thinking of it; which existed\nbefore we had ever thought and would exist if we were annihilated.\n(Examination, IX: 178\u20139) \n\n\nBut matter, so conceived, is not \u201cintrinsically distinct\u201d\nfrom sensation itself (Examination, IX: 182). Whether this\nstance is entirely coherent, we shall consider below, in\n section 3.7.\n\nMill\u2019s claim about the relativity of knowledge extends to our\nknowledge of mind itself. \n\n\n[O]ur knowledge of mind, like that of matter, is entirely relative\n[\u2026] We have no conception of Mind itself, as distinguished from\nits conscious manifestations. (Examination, IX: 188\u20139)\n\n\n\nWe know our own self, Mill claims, only as it phenomenally appears to\nus\u2014and we know of other selves only by inference from our own\ncase. Mill rejects the \u201ccommon theory of Mind, as a so-called\nsubstance\u201d (Examination, IX: 206). But he also resists\nthe total reduction of mind to the existence of sensations\u2014or\neven to the existence of possible sensations\u2014on the\ngrounds that there remains a unity to apperception. As he points out,\na reduction of self to sensations cannot be wholly satisfactory,\nbecause a sense of the self enters into many sensations as a\nconstituent part. When I recall a memory, for instance, the sensation\nis of a memory which has as part of its content that it is my\nmemory. \n\n\nIf, therefore, we speak of the Mind as a series of feelings, we are\nobliged to complete the statement by calling it a series of feelings\nwhich is aware of itself as past and future; and we are reduced to the\nalternative of believing that the Mind, or Ego, is something different\nfrom any series of feelings, or possibilities of them, or of accepting\nthe paradox, that something which ex hypothesi is but a\nseries of feelings, can be aware of itself as a series.\n(Examination, 194)\n\n\nOn the surface, Mill\u2019s motivations towards idealism is\nepistemic\u2014that we can never experience unmediated non-mental\nobjects, and so cannot be warranted in believing in their\nexistence. But the argument goes deeper, suggesting that we cannot\neven imagine what it would be to believe in the existence of\nnon-mental objects. \u201c[E]ven an imaginary object is but a\nconception, such as we are able to form, of something which would\naffect our senses\u201d (Examination, IX: 6). Indeed, Mill\nat times suggests a semantic version of the argument, which would\nestablish that the very meaning of our words\u2014determined, as they\nare, by experience\u2014obstructs us from referring to\nanything beyond experience.\n\n\nIt would, no doubt, be absurd to assume that our words exhaust the\npossibilities of Being. There may be innumerable modes of it which are\ninaccessible to our faculties, and which consequently we are unable to\nname. But we ought not to speak of these modes of Being by any of the\nnames we possess. These are all inapplicable, because they all stand\nfor known modes of Being. (Examination, IX: 11)\n\n\nIts bears emphasis that Mill\u2019s argument about the limits of\nhuman cognition does not depend on our current state of scientific\nknowledge\u2014or indeed upon the particular sense faculties we\npossess. Even if we had extra sense faculties or could come to\nperceive in new ways, he notes, all knowledge that would still be\n\u201cmerely phaenomenal\u201d (Examination, IX: 8).\nCognition, in any sentient creature must be mediated by some\nmethod of cognising\u2014and if even if we came to possess new ways\nof cognizing the world, \u201c[w]e should not, any more than at\npresent, know things as they are in themselves\u201d\n(Examination, IX: 8, my emphasis). Indeed, to say even that\n\u201cthe Creator\u201d knows things as they are in themselves is to\ncommit a confusion.\n3.7 Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy: Self-Supporting or Self-Undermining?\n\nMill\u2019s theoretical philosophy is, in an important sense,\ncircular and self-supporting (Skorupski 1989: 125, 149). As noted,\nMill views enumerative induction\u2014the sole method of warranted\ntheoretical reasoning\u2014as self-validating and self-improving. We\nspontaneously take certain initial inductive moves to be justified.\nInduction\u2019s self-examination then leads to an increasing\nconfidence that induction is a warranted way of reasoning\nabout the world, and to a general sharpening of that method of\nreasoning. Induction could have been self-undermining\u2014its\nsuccess as a form of reasoning about the world, established on its own\nterms, is not trivial.\n\nMore broadly, however, Mill\u2019s theoretical view of mind and world\nis as a whole circular and self-supporting. Mill\u2019s\nnaturalistic picture of the relation between mind and world\u2014of\nthe mind as itself part of the natural order and incapable of\nknowledge a priori\u2014must itself be treated as a\nsubstantive discovery. As such, it could only be arrived at by\ninductive reasoning. Inductive investigation allows us to better\nunderstand that the mind is itself governed by natural laws\u2014and\nto better understand the processes of sense perception that allow us\nto be causally receptive to the world. Elements of Mill\u2019s\nassociationist psychology are apt to strike us as outdated\u2014but\nthat does not alter the basic point that the naturalistic study of\nmind has been enormously successful in affording a better\nunderstanding of how we process the world we occupy. Such discoveries\nclarify and strengthen our sense of why a priori knowledge is\nimpossible in the first place, and why empirical investigation is\nnecessary for any genuine knowledge.\n\nThe view that Mill sketches is rich in potential\u2014and it has\nsufficient breadth to promise a successful means of theoretically\norienting ourselves in the world. The issue, of course, is, whether\nnaturalism is the only possible view. Granting that\nMill\u2019s theoretical philosophy is impressive on the grounds of\noffering a systematic and coherent way of thinking about the world and\nthe history of our theoretical engagement with it, the question\nremains whether that coherence and systematicity is any guarantee of\ntruth. The question must remain whether there are equally\ngood non-naturalistic ways of thinking about the world and our place\nwithin it. Because naturalism is a substantive doctrine, that is a\npossibility to which Mill must remain open.\n\nA more pressing question still is whether Mill\u2019s picture truly\nis coherent. As discussed above, Mill\u2019s naturalistic\napproach drives him, via his inductivism and endorsement of\nthe Relativity of Knowledge, towards idealism. Ultimately, he holds,\nthe only things that we can be warranted in believing are permanent\npossibilities of sensation. But such objects are not\u2014at least\nnot obviously\u2014natural entities. Mill is never entirely\nclear about the status of the permanent possibilities of sensation. To\nthe extent that they are ideal objects, we might doubt their status as\nnatural entities; the further reified such entities are in relation to\nactual sensations, the less plausible it is to characterise\nthe inference from sensation to the possibility of sensation as an\ninductive one. Whether Mill\u2019s naturalism is compatible with his\nidealism is very much an open question.\n\nThe worry enters from multiple directions. Perhaps most obviously, it\ncalls into question the down-to-earth realism that Mill endorses\nwithin the philosophy of science. Mill\u2019s claim that that the\nprocess of science involves finding the structure already\npresent in nature seems at least in tension with the claim that\nall knowledge is phenomenal and relativized. More subtly, Mill\u2019s\nbasic conception of the relation of mind and world also seems\nchallenged. Mill claims that a priori knowledge is impossible\nbecause we cannot know \n\n\nthat the universe of thought and that of reality, the Microcosm and\nthe Macrocosm (as they were once called) must have been framed in in\ncomplete correspondence with one another. (Examination, IX:\n68) \n\n\nBut if the world is fundamentally ideal\u2014if, as Mill\nseems to claim, our world is the world as conditioned by our\nmediating senses, because we can know and represent it in no other\nway\u2014we might wonder why a basic harmony between the\narchitecture of mind and world should not be taken as given, and a\npriori knowledge not be possible. Indeed, Mill\u2019s claim that\ncognition must be mediated by some method of\ncognising\u2014that any creature must perceive in this\nway\u2014itself seems suspiciously unrevisable and a\npriori.\n\nThese problems emerge because the priority between mind and world in\nMill\u2019s work is unclear: the mind is seen as both the condition\nfor the representation of the only world we ever encounter, and as a\nnatural object within the world. The former is brought to the\nforeground only in Mill\u2019s most philosophical moments\u2014the\nlatter is present throughout Mill\u2019s characterisation of\nscientific and ordinary thinking. One option to resolve this tension,\nof course, is to follow Kant in distinguishing transcendental and\nempirical levels of reflection\u2014another is to follow the\npost-Kantian idealists in attempting to unite and overcome such\noppositions wherever they occur. Mill, however, never worked through\nthe internal pressures of his own position with sufficient rigour to\nfeel the push within naturalism towards these\n positions.[4]\n4. Mill\u2019s Practical Philosophy\n4.1 The Foundations of Practical Reason: The \u2018Proof\u2019\n\nWhereas theoretical reasoning concerns what there is reason to\nbelieve, practical reasoning concerns how there is reason to\nact. Just as Mill thinks that there is one fundamental\nprinciple of theoretical reason\u2014the principle of enumerative\ninduction\u2014so too he thinks that there is one fundamental\nprinciple of practical reason. \n\n\nThere are not only first principles of Knowledge, but first principles\nof Conduct. There must be some standard by which to determine the\ngoodness or badness, absolute and comparative, of ends or objects of\ndesire. And whatever that standard is, there can be but one. (Mill,\nSystem, VIII: 951)\n\n\nThat principle, of course, is the principle of utility. \n\n\n[T]he general principle to which all rules of practice ought to\nconform, and the test by which they should be tried, is that of\nconduciveness to the happiness of mankind [\u2026] the promotion of\nhappiness is the ultimate principle of Teleology. (System,\nVIII: 951) \n\n\nThe claim that \u201chappiness is the sole end of human action, and\nthe promotion of it the test by which to judge of all human\nconduct\u201d stands at the center of Mill\u2019s practical\nphilosophy, determining how individuals should act, individually and\ncollectively (Utilitarianism, X: 237).\n\nThe principle of utility is examined in detail in\nUtilitarianism, during which it is both clarified and\ndefended. At the center of the work stands Mill\u2019s\n\u2018proof\u2019 of the principle of utility. The argument takes\nplace by way of three subclaims. Mill argues for:\n\n\ndesirability: that happiness is desirable as an end,\n\nexhaustiveness: that nothing but happiness is desirable as an\nend, and\n\nimpartiality: that each person\u2019s happiness is equally\ndesirable.\n\n\nMill takes the first subclaim\u2014desirability\u2014to be\nreasonably uncontentious. Happiness, most will admit, is at least\none of the things which is desirable (Donner 1991: 31). His\nargument for the claim, however, has become infamous.\n\n\nThe only proof capable of being given that an object is visible, is\nthat people actually see it. The only proof that a sound is audible,\nis that people hear it: and so of the other sources of our experience.\nIn like manner, I apprehend, the sole evidence it is possible to\nproduce that anything is desirable, is that people do actually desire\nit. (Utilitarianism, X: 234)\n\n\nMill adds to this the observation that \u201ceach person, so far as\nhe believes it to be attainable, desires his own happiness\u201d\n(Utilitarianism, X: 234). As such, happiness is shown to be\ndesirable as an end.\n\nG.E. Moore famously attacks this argument, suggesting that \u201cthe\nfallacy in this step is so obvious, that is quite wonderful how Mill\nfailed to see it\u201d (Moore 1993: 118). \u2018Desired\u2019 does\nnot bear the same relation to \u2018desirable\u2019 as\n\u2018heard\u2019 does to \u2018audible\u2019\u2014for\ndesirability is the property of being deserving or\nworthy of being desired, whereas audibility is property of\nbeing capable of being heard. Mill\u2019s choice of framing\nthe argument in this way is, admittedly, unfortunate, but the basic\nthrust of the argument is nevertheless strong, if understood in terms\nof its own aims.\n\nThe argument for the desirability of happiness is, like the rest of\nMill\u2019s philosophy, naturalistic in orientation. As was observed\nabove\n (section 2.1),\n Mill\u2019s naturalism leads him to the claim that we cannot have\nany knowledge by intuition. His claim that the \u201csole\nevidence\u201d it is possible to produce for normative claims about\ndesirability are empirical observations about what people \u201cdo\nactually desire\u201d must be seen in the context of this basic\ncommitment\u2014our knowledge of the desirable cannot be anchored by\ndirect a priori insight into the nature of the good, and as\nsuch can only come by way of critical examination of what human beings\ndo actually take as good.\n\n\u201c[P]ractised self-consciousness and self-observation, assisted\nby observation of others\u201d reveals that human beings do, as a\nmatter of fact, desire happiness (Utilitarianism, X: 237). We\ndo so, Mill claims, by virtue of our nature\u2014and that propensity\nstrikes us as reasonable upon inspection. That human beings\nuniversally do desire happiness, and take it to be reasonable to do so\nunder free consideration, is evidence that happiness is desirable.\nSuch evidence, of course, is defeasible\u2014but real nonetheless.\nAnd in the absence of reasons to doubt our universal tendency to\ndesire happiness, we are warranted in taking happiness to be\ndesirable. The argument for the desirability of happiness is, in this\nsense, parallel to Mill\u2019s initiating validation of the principle\nof enumerative induction (see\n \u00a73.2).\n\nHuman beings, of course, desire many things besides\nhappiness\u2014Mill acknowledges this fact as \u201cpalpable\u201d\n(Utilitarianism, X: 234). Insofar as what we desire\nis taken as evidence of what is desirable, this might seem\nincompatible with Mill\u2019s second subclaim\u2014that happiness is\nexhaustive of the desirable. Mill\u2019s strategy for\nestablishing that happiness is the only desirable thing is to\nshow that although there are other things which are desired by human\nbeings, such things are desired only because of the relation they bear\nto happiness. Many things, of course, are desired merely as means to\nhappiness. Upon inspection, such things do not strike us as\nultimately desirable, but merely as useful mechanisms for\nbringing about that which is ultimately desirable. Mill\nrecognises, however, that not all desiderata besides\nhappiness are desired merely as means. Some people, for instance,\n\u201cdesire virtue for its own sake\u201d\u2014as a matter of\n\u201cpsychological fact\u201d, they desire it\n\u201cdisinterestedly, for itself\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n237, 235). This does not threaten the claim that happiness is the only\nthing ultimately desirable, Mill argues, because for such individuals,\nvirtue is desirable because it forms a part of their\nhappiness.\n\n\nVirtue, according to the utilitarian doctrine, is not naturally and\noriginally part of the end, but it is capable of becoming so\n[\u2026] There was no original desire of it, or motive to it, save\nits conduciveness to pleasure, and especially to protection from pain.\nBut through the association thus formed, it may be felt a good in\nitself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good.\n(Utilitarianism X: 235\u20136)\n\n\nObjects which are desired initially merely as a means to happiness,\ncan become so central to a person\u2019s conception of what it means\nto be happy as to be seen as a part of their happiness. At\nthis point, they may be desired in themselves\u2014and quite apart\nfrom their results. We shall discuss this claim further below\n (section 4.2).\n But as part of Mill\u2019s general strategy for showing that nothing\nbeyond happiness is desirable, the import of the claim is clear. It\nallows Mill to argue that nothing apart from happiness is\nultimately desired. \u201cWhatever is desired otherwise than as a\nmeans [\u2026] to happiness, is desired as itself a part of\nhappiness\u201d, and as such \u201cthere is in reality nothing\ndesired except happiness\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 237).\n\nMill\u2019s argument for impartiality\u2014that that each\nperson\u2019s happiness is equally desirable\u2014passes quickly,\nand many have found it problematic. Mill claims that \u201ceach\nperson\u2019s happiness is a good to that person, and the general\nhappiness, therefore, a good to the aggregate of all persons\u201d\n(Utilitarianism, X: 234). The argument is, in one sense,\nmerely a reflection of Mill\u2019s individualism (cf.\nSystem, VIII: 879). The underlying thought is that the good\nof a group of people can be no other than the sum of the good\nof its members. But the argument goes deeper than this plausible\nclaim, relying on stronger premises. The supposition that \u201cequal\namounts of happiness are equally desirable, whether felt by the same\nor by different persons\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 258n) is\nin fact contentious. One might well argue, for instance, that to add\nto the happiness of the already content or the undeserving is\nnot to add to the general good at the same level as adding to\nthe happiness of the discontent or deserving: that the value of\nhappiness is in part determined by where it occurs. Mill does not,\nhowever, consider these objections.\n\nBy showing that happiness is desirable, that nothing other than\nhappiness is desirable, and that every person\u2019s happiness is\nequally desirable, Mill holds that \u201cthe principle of utility is\nproved\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 239). It is not, of course,\na proof in the traditional sense of being a logical deduction\nof the principle of utility. Indeed, Mill acknowledges that in a\nstrict sense, \u201cultimate ends are not amenable to direct\nproof\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 207; cf. X: 234). Being\nbased on critical examination of how we do reason, claims\nabout how we ought to reason\u2014whether practically or\ntheoretically\u2014must remain provisional, and open to ongoing\ncorrection by further observations of our reasoning practices.\nNevertheless, Mill holds, the \u2018proof\u2019 presents\n\u201c[c]onsiderations [\u2026] capable of determining the\nintellect\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 208). As such, the\nprinciple of utility\u2014\u201cthe doctrine that all things are\ngood or evil, by virtue solely of the pleasure or the pain which they\nproduce\u201d\u2014is shown to have \u201crational grounds\u201d\n(The Protagoras, XI: 61; Utilitarianism, X:\n208).\n4.2 Mill\u2019s Conception of Happiness\n\nWe have seen, then, that Mill holds that \u201chappiness is the sole\nend of human action, and the promotion of it the test by which to\njudge of all human conduct\u201d (Utilitarianism, X: 237).\nThe content of this claim, however, clearly depends to a great extent\nupon what is meant by happiness. Mill gives what seems to be\na clear and unambiguous statement of his meaning. \u201cBy happiness\nis intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain,\nand the privation of pleasure\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n210). That statement has seemed to many to commit Mill, at a basic\nlevel, to hedonism as an account of happiness and a theory of\nvalue\u2014that it is pleasurable sensations that are the\nultimately valuable thing.\n\nMill departs from the Benthamite account, however, which holds that if\ntwo experiences contain equal quantities of pleasure, then they are\nthereby equally valuable. In contrast, Mill argues that \n\n\n[i]t would be absurd that while, in estimating all other things,\nquality is considered as well as quantity, the estimation of pleasures\nshould be supposed to depend on quantity alone.\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211) \n\n\nSome pleasures are, by their nature, of a higher quality than\nothers\u2014and as such are to be valued more.\n\n\nIf I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or\nwhat makes one pleasure more valuable than another, merely as a\npleasure, except its being greater in amount, there is but one\npossible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or\nalmost all who have experience of both give a decided preference\n[\u2026] that is the more desirable pleasure.\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211)\n\n\nThe claim is one purely relating to value ordering\u2014that there\ncan exist experiences h and l, such that h\nis more valuable than l, despite l containing an\nequal or greater quantity of pleasure than h. Some\ncommentators (Riley 2002) have\nclaimed that Mill holds that any quantity of a higher\npleasure is more valuable than any quantity of a lower\npleasure on the basis of the following passage:\n\n\nIf one of the two [pleasures] is, by those who are competently\nacquainted with both, placed so far above the other that they prefer\nit [\u2026] and would not resign it for any quantity of the other\npleasure which their nature is capable of, we are justified in\nascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality.\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211)\n\n\nThe claim that it would be rational to sacrifice any amount\nof a lower pleasure for a minuscule amount of a higher pleasure,\nthough, seems too implausible to attribute to Mill\u2014and in the\npassage cited, he only registers a sufficient condition for\nconsidering one pleasure of a higher quality to another, and not a\nnecessary condition (Saunders 2011; Miller 2010: 58). In\nfact, Mill gives very little indication as to how to weigh quality\nagainst quantity of pleasure\u2014he simply does not speak to the\nspecifics of how varying quantities of pleasures at varying qualities\nare to be reconciled against one another.\n\nThe question remains as to which sorts of pleasures are of\nhigher quality than others. Mill holds that pleasures \u201cof the\nintellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral\nsentiments\u201d are amongst the higher pleasures\n(Utilitarianism, X: 211). But Mill\u2019s doctrine need not\nbe read as restrictively intellectualist. As well as pleasures of the\nmind, he holds that pleasures gained in activity are of a\nhigher quality than those gained passively (Liberty,\nXVIII: 262; cf. Utilitarianism, X: 215). Ultimately, however,\nthe quality of any given pleasure must itself be a substantive\nquestion, to be addressed by ongoing experimentation and comparison of\nthe preferences of competent judges\u2014those who have experienced,\nand appreciated, the sorts of pleasure being compared.\n\nThe lurking suspicion for many has been that in distinguishing\nqualities of pleasure, Mill departs from hedonism. If Mill\nclaims that a small amount of pleasure can be more valuable\nthan a high amount, anti-hedonist interpreters suggests, it\nmust be on the grounds of valuing something apart from the\npleasurable experience itself\u2014for if Mill valued solely\nthe pleasurable experience, then he would always value more\npleasurable experience over less. Mill must, that is to say, consider\nhigh quality pleasures more valuable not on account of their\npleasantness, but on some other grounds\u2014i.e., their source. But\nthis would be to abandon hedonism. The anti-hedonist interpretation\nmight be further supported by appealing to Mill\u2019s talk of\n\u2018parts of happiness\u2019. As was noted above, when defending\nthe claim that happiness is the sole end of action, Mill acknowledges\nthat \u201c[t]he ingredients of happiness are very various, and each\nof them is desirable in itself\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n235). While talk of (for instance) virtue as a part of\nhappiness is certainly intelligible, it is perhaps less obvious that\nit is compatible with his hedonism.\n\nThose who doubt whether Mill remains a hedonist have in general\nclaimed that Mill moves towards a eudaimonistic or\nperfectionist account of happiness (Brink 2013: 46ff.;\nNussbaum 2004; Clark 2010). By \u2018happiness\u2019, they claim,\nMill does not mean certain experiences or\nsensations, but rather the flourishing that is achieved in\nthe realization of a character ideal. There are occasions when Mill\nmakes claims which lend themselves to such an interpretation. When, in\nOn Liberty, Mill emphasizes the value of autonomy and\noriginality\u2014when he claims that \u201c[i]t really is of\nimportance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they are\nthat do it\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 263)\u2014his focus does\nseem to be on the value of being a certain way, rather than\nthe value of experiences.\n\nIt is certainly true that, in attempting to combine the best of\neighteenth-century empiricism and nineteenth-century romanticism, Mill\ngravitated towards character as the locus of practical\ntheorizing (Devigne 2006). This, by necessity, involved a change of\nemphasis in his philosophy. The question, however, is whether\nMill\u2019s focus on character is simply an instance of his attempt\nto elicit \u201cdynamical conclusions\u201d from \u201cmechanical\npremises\u201d (Letter to Thomas Carlyle, XII:\n181)\u2014whether, in other words, his attempt is to rest a\ncharacter-focused ethic upon hedonistic foundations. The claim that\nsome qualities of pleasure are more valuable than others need not\nviolate the core claim of hedonism: that pleasurable experiences are\nthe ultimately valuable things. It is perfectly open to the hedonist\nto claim that different pleasurable experiences are, on the grounds of\ntheir phenomenology, of different value. Mill\u2019s associationism\nprovides the resources to claim that pleasures are themselves complex\nand evolving emotions, reflective of, and often entangled with, the\ncharacters that give rise to them. This too may offer some explanation\nof what Mill means by claiming that, for instance, virtue can become\npart of our happiness. Given Mill\u2019s profession that\n\n\n\nall desirable things [\u2026] are desirable either for the pleasure\ninherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and\nthe prevention of pain, \n\n\nthen, there seems little reason to doubt his commitment to hedonism\n(Utilitarianism, X: 210).\n4.3 Morality\n\nIt is important to note that the claims made so far concern\nMill\u2019s axiology (Fletcher 2008). They concern, that is to say,\nwhat states of affairs are valuable\u2014which outcomes are\ngood. Such axiological claims are, in themselves, silent on\nthe question of our moral obligations. Mill is not a maximizing\nutilitarian about the moral. Although, admittedly, he often makes\nstatements which seem to imply that he is committed to this\nposition\u2014most famously, towards the beginning of\nUtilitarianism, that \u201cactions are right in proportion\nas they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the\nreverse of happiness\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n210)\u2014such statements should be understood as simplifying devices\nfor the purposes of initial exposition. Other, more careful,\nstatements clearly show that this is not his considered position.\n\nThe maximizing utilitarian believes that we are morally obliged to\nbring about the most happiness we can\u2014that insofar as\nwe fall short of this mark, we violate our moral obligations. Yet Mill\nclearly believes that we are not obliged to do all that we\ncan upon pain of moral censure.\n\n\nIt is not good that persons should be bound, by other people\u2019s\nopinion, to do everything that they would deserve praise for doing.\nThere is a standard of altruism to which all should be required to\ncome up, and a degree beyond it which is not obligatory, but\nmeritorious. (Auguste Comte and Positivism, X: 337)\n\n\nMill, that is to say, believes in the existence of a class of\nsupererogatory acts (Donner 2009: 140\u20133). While it might be\nextremely praiseworthy to do the most good that we\ncan\u2014and while there might be reason to do the most good\nthat we can\u2014failure to do so is not the standard that marks the\ndistinction between acting morally and immorally. Rather, Mill claims,\nthe notion of moral wrong is connected to that of\npunishment.\n\n\nI think there is no doubt that this distinction lies at the bottom of\nthe notions of right and wrong; that we call any conduct wrong, or\nemploy, instead, some other term of dislike or disparagement,\naccording as we think that the person ought, or ought not, to be\npunished for it. (Utilitarianism, X: 246)\n\n\nMill\u2019s notion of \u2018punishment\u2019, however, is a broad\none.\n\n\nWe do not call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person\nought to be punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by law,\nby the opinion of his fellow creatures; if not by opinion, by the\nreproaches of his own conscience. [\u2026] [If] it is not a case of\nmoral obligation; we do not blame them, that is, we do not think that\nthey are proper objects of punishment. (Utilitarianism, X:\n246)\n\n\nAn act is morally wrong, then, if it is blameworthy, i.e., if\nit would be proper to blame an agent for performing that act.\nThe question, of course, is what grounds such norms of blame.\nInterpreters have in general taken Mill to believe that whether we\nought to blame an individual for any given act\u2014and whether,\ntherefore that act is morally wrong\u2014is determined by\nconsiderations of utilitarian efficiency. An act is wrong, therefore,\nif it would be productive to overall utility to blame an individual\nfor performing that act\u2014or, under a rule-focused interpretation,\nif it would be productive to overall utility for there to exist a rule\nto the effect that individuals performing actions of that sort were\nsubject to\n blame.[5]\n\nThe efficiency of such norms of blame will be dependent, in part, on\nthe culture in which they are to operate\u2014on the dispositions of\nindividuals to react to blame and the promise of blame, and on the\npossibility of inculcating these dispositions in a given\ngroup\u2014and, for this reason, the domain of moral duty will vary\nwith time and place (Auguste Comte, X: 338; Miller 2010: 99).\nA significant remaining question is whether there is a constraint\nplaced on morality by the logic of that emotion: whether, in other\nwords, there are certain actions which, because of the nature of the\nemotion of blame, cannot be regarded as morally wrong (Jacobson\n2008).\n\nMill\u2019s stance on the place of morality in practical reasoning\noverall\u2014how our moral obligations are related to what we ought\nto do, all things considered\u2014is complex. Mill writes that \n\n\nthe moral view of actions and characters [\u2026] is\nunquestionably the first and most important mode of looking at them.\n(Bentham, X: 112) \n\n\nBut, at the same time, he is critical of those\n\u201cmorality-intoxicated\u201d philosophers who take morality to\ncrowd out the sphere of practical reason entirely\u2014who treat the\nmoral dimension of questions about how we should act \u201cas if it\nwere the sole one\u201d (Auguste Comte, X: 336;\nBentham, X: 112). \u201cPractical Reason\u201d\u2014or, as\nMill also terms it, \u201cthe Art of Life\u201d\u2014has as its\nproper object, bringing into existence the greatest possible\n happiness.[6]\n It is divided into three domains: \u201cMorality, Prudence or\nPolicy, and Aesthetics; the Right, the Expedient, and the Beautiful or\nNoble\u201d (System, VIII: 949; cf. Bentham, X:\n112). An action is prudent simply to the extent that it maximizes a\nperson\u2019s individual utility, which can of course be in part a\nfunction of others\u2019 utility; an action is beautiful to the\nextent that it is admirable, and excites aesthetic pleasure in its\ncontemplation (cf. Loizides 2013: 133\u201340).\n\nMoral rules play a role in guiding and evaluating action, to be sure,\nbut so do rules of aesthetics and prudence: these too promote the\ngeneral happiness, and as such provide reasons for action. There can,\nof course, be clashes between such rules of morality, prudence, and\naesthetics\u2014and, indeed, clashes of rules within those\ndomains. In such cases, Mill writes, it is \u201crequisite that first\nprinciples should be appealed to\u201d (Utilitarianism, X:\n226; cf. System, VIII: 951). Mill also allows that appeal be\nmade directly to the principle of utility on occasions when an agent\nknows that following rules\u2014moral, prudential, or\naesthetic\u2014would generate significantly less overall happiness\nthan violating those rules (Utilitarianism, X: 223;\nTaylor\u2019s Statesman XIX: 638\u201340). But Mill is\nunclear as to how often such clashes and exceptions license direct\nappeal to the principle of utility. To the extent that one ought\noften to ignore the rules of morality, prudence, and\naesthetics, and act simply on the basis of which action is most\nchoice-worthy according to the theory of practical reason overall,\nMill is, in the end, pulled towards something which comes to resemble\nan act-utilitarianism position (Turner 2015).\n4.4 Equality, the Sexes, and the Nineteenth Century\n\nThe nineteenth century was a period coming to terms with the rise of\ndemocracy, and this is reflected in the concerns of its social\nphilosophy. Mill\u2019s writings in this area are no exception. His\nengagement with the question of how society and its institutions ought\nto be organized is of course guided by an abstract commitment to\ngeneral happiness as the measure of the success of all human\npractice\u2014but it is also deeply attentive to the concrete\npossibilities and dangers of the newly emerging democratic era, and\nhow they relate to this overarching goal (Skorupski 2006).\n\nInfluenced by Tocqueville, Mill held that the great trend of his own\nperiod was a falling away of aristocratic mores and a growth\nof\n equality.[7]\n Mill\u2019s distinctively English take on modern Europe\u2019s\n\u201cirresistible tendency to equality of conditions\u201d\ncharacterised the spread of equality as a manifestation of \u201cthe\ngrowth of the middle class\u201d (De Tocqueville on Democracy in\nAmerica [II], XVIII: 150, 196). Although modern Europe had not\nannihilated the class distinctions of earlier periods, in Mill\u2019s\nview, such differences were becoming less and less influential on\nsocial norms. Wealth, education, status, and therefore power, he held,\nwere amassing with a socially and politically dominant middle class,\nwhose shared commercial traits and interests dictated equality as the\nemerging rule.\n\nMill believes that this trend presents a chance for the improvement of\nsociety\u2014in this sense, he stands as the heir to Bentham and\nJames Mill in trying to drive forward the agenda of modernisation.\nBut, like many of his nineteenth-century contemporaries\u2014in\nparticular, conservative social critics such as Coleridge and\nCarlyle\u2014he also sees that the newly emerging order carries with\nit newly emerging dangers. His aim was therefore to ameliorate the\nnegative effects of the rise of equality, while capitalising on the\nopportunity it presented for reform.\n\nThe most pressing need for reform in this situation, Mill thought, was\nthe removal of structures of discrimination and oppression against\nwomen. Mill held, on the grounds of associationist psychology, that\nhuman character is wholly a product of upbringing. As such, he was\nsuspicious of the then common claim that women had a different nature\nfrom men\u2014and that the sexes were therefore naturally suited for\ndifferent roles within the family and society more broadly.\n\n\n[N]o one can safely pronounce that if women\u2019s nature were left\nto choose its direction as freely as men\u2019s, and if no artificial\nbent were attempted to be given to it except that required by the\nconditions of human society, and given to both sexes alike, there\nwould be any material difference, or perhaps any difference at all, in\nthe character and capacities that would unfold themselves.\n(Subjection, XXI: 305)\n\n\nTo the extent that the sexes in general exhibit different character\ntraits, these traits are the product of upbringing into\nstereotypes, rather the justification for such stereotypes.\nSo too for differences that are claimed to exist naturally between the\nraces, and to justify the authority of one set of individuals over\nanother (The Negro Question, XII: 93). With the growth of\nequality that came with a dominant middle class, Mill held, these\nforms of oppression stood out all the more clearly, and the time was\ntherefore ripe to dismantle such practices of discrimination.\n\nSuch practices were, Mill held, objectionable on the grounds of\n\u201csocial expediency\u201d\u2014that they were detrimental to\noverall utility (Subjection, XXI: 64; cf. Admission of\nWomen to Franchise, XXVIII: 152). The denial of the vote harmed\nthe disenfranchised on two grounds. Firstly, their\ninterests\u2014interests which might diverge in significant ways from\nother groups (Autobiography, I: 107)\u2014went unrepresented\nin Parliament, and were therefore liable to frustration. Secondly, to\ndeny individuals access to political participation was to deny them\naccess to an important aspect of the good and happy life.\n\n\n[A]n equal right to be heard\u2014to have a share in influencing the\naffairs of the country\u2014to be consulted, to be spoken to, and to\nhave agreements and considerations turning upon politics addressed to\none\u2014tended to elevate and educate the self-respect of the man\n[\u2026] To give people an interest in politics and in the\nmanagement of their own affairs was the grand cultivator of mankind\n[\u2026] That was one of the reasons why he wanted women to have\nvotes; they needed cultivation as well as men. (Westminster\nElection 1865 [4], XXVIII: 39; see also Considerations,\nXIX: 469)\n\n\nFor these reasons, Mill fought against political discrimination\nthroughout his life, both as a philosopher and a Member of Parliament\n(Kinzer, Robson and Robson 1992; Varouxakis 2013). We shall return to\nthe complexities of Mill\u2019s views on political democracy below\n (section 4.7),\n but in the context of discussion of equality, we should note that\nMill was just as critical of social forms of discrimination as of the\ndenial of the vote to women. Barriers to education and the\nprofessions, he held, were as much in need of reform as barriers to\nrepresentation (Subjection, XXI: 300). But his most vehement\ncriticisms were made of the institution of marriage, as practiced in\nhis own time.\n\nMarriage\u2014which in this period deprived the wife of property and\nlegal personhood, and forced total obedience to a husband\u2014was,\nMill held, akin to slavery (Subjection, XXI: 271). Often, he\nobserved, it involved physical violence. But even where this was not\nthe case, the preparation for and participation in such unequal\npartnerships caused women to develop constrained, artificial, and\nsubmissive personalities. And not only was it degrading for women to\nbe held in such a position of slavery\u2014exercising such domination\nwas debasing to men, corrupting their personalities, too\n(Subjection, XXI: 321). The prevalence of such a vicious\npower-relationship in a central area of human life cried out for\nrenovation. The only circumstances in which marriage could be a\npositive institution, adding to human happiness, was one in which men\nand women were treated with total equality (Miller 2017).\n4.5 On Liberty and Freedom of Speech\n\nThe transformation of society from aristocratic to increasingly\ndemocratic forms of organization brought with it opportunities, then.\nBut it also presented dangers. It meant rule by a social mass which\nwas more powerful, uniform, and omnipresent than the sovereigns of\nprevious eras. The dominance of the majority, Mill held, presented new\nthreats of tyranny over the individual\u2014freedom was no less at\nrisk from a newly empowered many, than from an absolute monarch. The\nrestrictions over freedom that concerned Mill included, to be sure,\nlegislatively enacted restrictions of liberty\u2014but they also took\nin broader \u201ccompulsion and control, whether the means used be\nphysical force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion\nof public opinion\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 223). Informal\nmechanisms of social pressure and expectation could, in mass\ndemocratic societies, be all-controlling. Mill worried that the\nexercise of such powers would lead to stifling conformism in thought,\ncharacter and action.\n\nIt was in this context that On Liberty was written (Scarre\n2007: 1\u20139). The aim of the argument is announced in the first\nchapter:\n\n\nThe object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle\n[\u2026] That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are\nwarranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the\nliberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.\n(Liberty, XVIII: 223)\n\n\nAs with all of Mill\u2019s practical philosophy, the argument for\nthis claim is utilitarian. \n\n\nIt is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be\nderived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing\nindependent of utility. (Liberty, XVIII: 224) \n\n\nIt could not be known a priori that we should organize\nsociety along liberal principles. Indeed, Mill held conditions of\nfreedom are only desirable in civilized societies\u2014\u201c[u]ntil\nthen, there is nothing for them but implicit obedience to an Akbar or\na Charlemagne, if they are so fortunate as to find one\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 224). Mill\u2019s case for liberty, in this\nsense, is based on observation about the conditions under which human\nbeings flourish and are happy.\n\nMill\u2019s claim that On Liberty presents \u201cone very\nsimple principle\u201d\u2014is \u201ca kind of philosophic\ntext-book of a single truth\u201d\u2014perhaps belies the fact that\nthere are many distinct arguments and conclusions drawn throughout the\ntext (Liberty, XVIII: 223; Autobiography, I: 259).\nMill employs different strategies to argue for freedom of thought and\ndiscussion, freedom of character, and freedom of action\u2014and\nalthough of course such arguments overlap, they must be carefully\nunpicked if we are to appreciate their strengths and weaknesses. In\nthis section, we will consider the argument for freedom of speech,\nturning, in the next section, to his case for freedom of character and\naction more broadly.\n\nMill\u2019s argument for the freedom of thought and discussion is\ngiven in chapter 2 of On Liberty, and in it he aims to show\nthat there should be no attempt \u201cto control the expression of\nopinion\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 229; see Riley 2015: 74ff.).\nThe chapter takes the form of a proof from the exhaustion of cases.\nMill claims that, for any opinion P which is a candidate for\nsuppression, P must be either: (i) true, (ii) false, or (iii)\npartially true. Whichever is the case, he argues, P\u2019s\nassertion will be useful for discovering and maintaining the\ntruth\u2014and as such should be welcome. \n\nTrue beliefs are in general suppressed because, though they are true,\nthey are thought to be false. To assume that because one\nthinks a view is false, it should be suppressed, Mill argues, is to\nassume infallibility for one\u2019s beliefs. Human beings, though,\nare not creatures capable of infallible knowledge. Mill\u2019s\nempiricism leads him to believe that we do not have direct a\npriori insight into the truth, and that all of our beliefs must\nremain open to revision in light of further observation. As such,\ndiscussion must remain open\u2014even on issues which we think\nsecurely established. It might be argued, he observes, that certain\ntrue beliefs should be suppressed because, although true, they are\nthought to be harmful. But to argue that we should suppress a\nview because it is harmful would either be to assume infallibility on\nits status as harmful, or to allow debate on that\nquestion\u2014which in turn must involve debate on the substantive\nissue itself. Opinions belonging to case (i) therefore ought to not to\nbe suppressed.\n\nEven when a belief is false, Mill holds, its assertion may\nstill be conducive to securing the truth\u2014and as such, opinions\nbelonging to case (ii) should not be suppressed. The assertion of\nfalse opinions leads to debate\u2014which in turn leads to greater\nunderstanding. Without active defence of a truth, we risk losing sense\nof its real meaning, with genuine knowledge becoming reduced to\n\u201cphrases retained by rote\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 249).\nIt is therefore just as important to hear counterarguments to the\ntruth as its re-articulation.\n\n\nHowever unwillingly a person who has a strong opinion may admit the\npossibility that his opinion may be false, he ought to be moved by the\nconsideration that however true it may be, if it is not fully,\nfrequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma,\nnot a living truth. (Liberty, XVIII: 243)\n\n\nMill holds that \n\n\nthere is a commoner case than either of these; when the conflicting\ndoctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the\ntruth between them. (Liberty, XVIII: 252) \n\n\nSuch situations make up case (iii). In complicated\nmatters\u2014especially in matter of politics of morality\u2014the\ntruth is \u201cmany-sided\u201d (Letter to Thomas Carlyle\nXII: 181). Most well-thought-out views\u2014whether conservative or\nliberal\u2014on such matters contain part of the truth.\nIndividuals are rarely in the position to see the \u201cwhole\ntruth\u201d for themselves, and the only way for it to emerge is by\ntherefore by \u201cthe reconciling and combining of opposites\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 258, 254).\n\nMill takes the three cases to be exhaustive: whatever an\nopinion\u2019s status in terms of truth, then, its suppression would\nbe epistemically damaging (Skorupski 1989: 377\u201383). The\nargument\u2019s focus on truth, of course, limits the scope\nof the argument. Though there may be arguments establishing that forms\nof communication which do not have truth as their goal\u2014poetry,\nart, music\u2014should be free from interference, these are not to be\nfound in chapter 2, but later in On Liberty.\n4.6 On Liberty and Freedom of Character and Action\n\nMill\u2019s argument for freedom of\ncharacter\u2014\u201cIndividuality\u201d (Liberty, XVIII:\n260)\u2014is given in chapter 3 of On Liberty, and is\ntwo-pronged. On the one hand, he argues that it is best for\nindividuals that they are given freedom and space to develop\ntheir own character. On the other, he argues that it best for\nsociety, too. Mill\u2019s argument for the former is Romantic in\ntone, maintaining that, because different individuals have different\nnatures, they must be given space to discover and develop their own\npersonalities and ways of living.\n\n\nHuman nature is not a machine to be built after a model, and set to do\nexactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which requires to grow\nand develope itself on all sides, according to the tendency of the\ninward forces which make it a living thing. (Liberty, XVIII:\n263)\n\n\nThe basic diversity of human beings means it is not productive for\nthere to exist an expectation that all individuals will live in a\nsimilar manner. In this sense, the argument is a pragmatic one: that\none mode of life is unlikely to fit all individual tastes. But Mill\nalso suggests that it is a central feature of the good life that it be\na life chosen for oneself. \n\n\nIt is possible that he might be guided in some good path [\u2026]\nBut what will be his comparative worth as a human being? It really is\nof importance, not only what men do, but also what manner of men they\nare that do it. (Liberty, XVIII: 263) \n\n\nAlong with other thinkers of the period\u2014Arnold, Nietzsche, and\nSchiller are all useful points of comparison\u2014Mill believes that\nthe great danger of mass-society is self-repression and conformism,\nleading to the sapping of human energy and creativity. Victorian\nsociety was, he claimed, governed by an ethos of propriety based on\n\u201cChristian self-denial\u201d; Mill, in contrast, encourages the\n\u201cGreek ideal of self-development\u201d (Liberty,\nXVIII: 266). It is individuals that are well-rounded, authentic and\nspontaneous, he believes, that are most truly happy.\n\nIt is also important for society more broadly that individuals be free\nto develop their own ways of living. It is beneficial to have a rich\nvariety of \u201cexperiments of living\u201d (Liberty,\nXVIII: 260) on display in any given society, to allow individuals to\nbe inspired by a wide range of possible forms of life. And the variety\nthat exists within such a context, Mill thinks, key to maintaining\nsocial progress. A \u201cdiversity of character and culture\u201d\nprovides the engine of productive tension that drives a nation\nforward. Without it, Mill fears \u201cChinese stationariness\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 188; De Tocqueville on Democracy in\nAmerica [II], XVIII: 189).\n\n\nThe despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human\nadvancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that disposition to aim\nat something better than customary, which is called, according to\ncircumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or\nimprovement. (Liberty, XVIII: 272)\n\n\nIn chapters 4 and 5 of On Liberty, Mill\u2019s attention\nturns from a general defence of the salutary effects of freedom to an\nan exploration of which actions in particular should or\nshould not be subject to interference. The scope of legitimate\ncoercion is guided by the \u2018harm principle\u2019: \n\n\nthe only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any\nmember of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm\nto others. (Liberty, XVIII: 223; cf. Liberty, XVIII:\n292) \n\n\nAn individual\u2019s action can be legitimately encroached upon if\nand only if that action might harm another individual. Of course, it\nmay not be prudent to intervene in all cases in which it be\nlegitimate to do so. In this sense, the principle merely\nstates the conditions under which interference is\npermissible\u2014not the conditions under which it is desirable.\n\nMill rules out intervention in that \u201cpart of a person\u2019s\nlife which concerns only himself\u201d primarily because\nindividuals\u2014once they have reached \u201cthe maturity of their\nfaculties\u201d\u2014are far more competent with respect to their\nown good than others (Liberty, XVIII: 280, 224; see Turner\n2013).\n\n\n[W]ith respect to his own feelings and circumstances, the most\nordinary man or woman has means of knowledge immeasurably surpassing\nthose that can be possessed by any one else. The interference of\nsociety to overrule his judgment and purposes in what only regards\nhimself, must be grounded on general presumptions; which may be\naltogether wrong, and even if right, are as likely as not to be\nmisapplied to individual cases. (Liberty, XVIII: 277)\n\n\nAs such, there should exist a general presumption against\npaternalistic attempts to interfere with an individual\u2019s\nself-regarding conduct for their own good.\n\nMill readily admits that no conduct is self-regarding in the sense\nthat it affects only the agent themselves. \u201cNo person is an\nentirely isolated being\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 280). But it\nis only when an individual \u201cviolate[s] a distinct and assignable\nobligation to any other person or persons, the case is taken out of\nthe self-regarding class\u201d (Liberty, XVIII: 281). In the\nsense Mill intends, then, we harm an individual only when we violate\nan obligation to that individual. The damage done by the bad example\nset to others by a drunkard provides no legitimate reason for\ninterference with his conduct; if his drunkenness causes him to\nviolate the obligation to support his family, then that action\nconstitutes a harm and is subject to interference.\n\nMill\u2019s concern, throughout On Liberty, is to preserve\nthe individual\u2019s freedom not only in the face of the threat of\nlegislative or state coercion, but from the threat of more insidious\nforms of social coercion. In mass society, curtain-twitching\njudgmentalism and whispered smear-campaigns can be more dangerously\ncontrolling than formal acts of tyranny, \u201cpenetrating much more\ndeeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 220). And yet, of course, Mill holds that\nindividuals are themselves free to form unfavorable opinions about the\ncharacter of others. We are free to remonstrate with an individual, to\navoid him, and to encourage others to avoid him\u2014that is\nour right. But not to \u201cparade the avoidance\u201d\n(Liberty, XVIII: 278). The dividing line between the\nlegitimate and illegitimate use of our freedom, however, is surely\ndifficult to draw.\n4.7 Authority and Democracy\n\nAs we have seen, Mill believes that we can have no genuine knowledge\na priori. One important result of this general claim, Mill\nholds, is that knowledge\u2014on political and ethical matters, as\nwell as within the physical sciences\u2014is more difficult to\nacquire than those who appeal directly to intuition or common sense\nmight wish. An individual\u2019s need for knowledge far outstrips the\npossibility of individual observation\u2014as such, the vast majority\nof our knowledge must be acquired on the basis of testimony.\n\n\nI yield to no one in the degree of intelligence of which I believe\n[the people] to be capable. But I do not believe that, along with this\nintelligence, they will ever have sufficient opportunities of study\nand experience, to become themselves familiarly conversant with all\nthe inquiries which lead to the truths by which it is good that they\nshould regulate their conduct, and to receive into their own minds the\nwhole of the evidence from which those truths have been collected, and\nwhich is necessary for their establishment. [\u2026] As long as the\nday consists but of twenty-four hours, and the age of man extends but\nto threescore and ten [\u2026] the great majority of mankind will\nneed the far greater part of their time and exertions for procuring\ntheir daily bread. (Spirit of the Age, XXII: 241)\n\n\nIn previous ages, the existence of a leisured and spiritual class\nmeant that it was relatively easy to establish who possessed\nthe intellectual authority to function as leaders in thought and\naction (Spirit of the Age, XXII: 304\u20135). But the\neighteenth-century Enlightenment philosophers had discredited these\ntrusted forms of authority, making it increasingly difficult to\ndistinguish \u201cwell-grounded opinion\u201d from\n\u201ccharlatanerie\u201d (Civilization, XVIII: 132,\n 135).[8]\n The rise of the numerical majority in the modern-era meant that the\nindividual was liable to become \u201cso lost in the crowd, that\nthough he depends more and more upon opinion, he is apt to depend less\nand less upon well-grounded opinion\u201d (Civilization,\nXVIII: 132; cf. Liberty, VIII: 268).\n\nUltimately, Mill remains optimistic about the prospects of the modern\nindividual to successfully autonomously navigate that crowd and\nidentify voices worthy of respect.\n\n\nNo government by a democracy or a numerous aristocracy [\u2026] ever\ndid or could rise above mediocrity, except in so far as the sovereign\nMany have let themselves be guided (which in their best times they\nalways have done) by the counsels and influence of a more highly\ngifted and instructed One or Few. [\u2026] The honour and glory of\nthe average man is that he is capable of following that initiative;\nthat he can respond internally to wise and noble things, and be led to\nthem with his eyes open. (Liberty, XVIII: 269)\n\n\nHe is conscious, however, that effort is required to preserve and\ncultivate the individual\u2019s ability to recognize and respond to\nsuch voices. Formal education, of course, must play a significant role\nin maintaining an \u201can enlightened public\u201d who know enough\n\u201cto be able to discern who are those that know them\nbetter\u201d (Inaugural Address, XXI: 223; see Findlay\n2017). But Mill also looks to the institution of democracy\nitself to help solidify the influence of elites.\n\nMill held, as was noted above\n (section 4.4),\n that the democratic expansion of the franchise was inevitable, and to\nbe welcomed. Possessing the vote ensured that an individual\u2019s\ninterests would be represented\u2014and, equally importantly, it had\nan elevating and educative effect on the public. Active participation\nin collective decision making was, Mill held, part of the good and\nhappy life (Urbinati 2002). He was in favor, therefore, of extending\nthe vote to all those who were not reliant on public support and\npossessed a basic competency in reading, writing, and arithmetic.\n\u201cBut though every one ought to have a voice\u2014that every one\nshould have an equal voice is a totally different proposition\u201d\n(Considerations, XIX: 473). In an ideal system of democracy,\nMill held, those whose opinions are \u201centitled to a greater\namount of consideration\u201d would be given more consideration, with\nlevel of education determining the number of votes a person could cast\n(Considerations, XIX: 474; see Miller 2015).\n\nA system of plural voting would not only counteract the tendency of\ndemocracy to descend into rule by the mob, but would embody and signal\nthe general principle that some opinions are more worthy of attention\nthan others.\n\n\nIt is not useful, but hurtful, that the constitution of the country\nshould declare ignorance to be entitled to as much political power as\nknowledge. The national institutions should place all things that they\nare concerned with, before the mind of the citizen in the light in\nwhich it is for his good that he should regard them: and as it is for\nhis good that he should think that every one is entitled to some\ninfluence, but the better and wiser to more than others.\n(Considerations, XIX: 478)\n\n\nMill\u2019s concern to ensure that the recognition of genuine\nexpertise is not lost in the age of democracy also underlies\nhis support for Thomas Hare\u2019s system of Proportional\nRepresentation. Instead of limiting the choice to local candidates,\nMill hoped to allow voters to join together and elect the most\ndistinguished candidates from throughout the nation, resulting in the\n\u201cvery \u00e9lite of the country\u201d being elected\nto, and exercising an influence within and beyond, Parliament\n(Considerations, XIX: 456). The desire for expertise also\nguides Mill\u2019s belief that a Second Chamber would, at best, be a\nSenate composed of those who had previously held high political\noffices or employments, and had thereby established their quality as\n\u201cnatural leaders\u201d (Considerations, XIX: 516).\n\nMill\u2019s attempt to secure conditions in which genuine authorities\ncan be identified and heard amongst the clamor of democratic society\nis not, of course, an attempt to stifle other voices. Neither\nis it an attempt to impose the will of experts on an unwilling\nmajority. At all points, Mill remains committed to the freedom of\nindividuals to hold and express their own opinions, and to the\nsovereignty of the majority will on public matters. His sensitivity\ntowards the very real dangers of populism in modern societies is, that\nis to say, never allowed to overshadow his basic commitment to liberal\ndemocracy as the political system most suited to the cultivation of a\nfree, active, and happy citizenry.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Primary Sources", "Secondary Sources"], "cat_ref_text": {"Primary Sources": "</h3>\n<p>\nAll citations of Mill are taken from <em>The Collected Works of John\nStuart Mill</em>, edited by John M.
