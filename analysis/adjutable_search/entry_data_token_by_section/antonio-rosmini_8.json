    "main_text": "Natural theology\n9. Being\n\n\nThe last nine years of Rosmini\u2019s life, with the exception of 1848\u20139\nwhen he was actively engaged in political affairs, were spent in great\npart working on his Theosophy (Teosofia). Despite its\nsize (five volumes), this monumental work remained unfinished at\nRosmini\u2019s death and was published posthumously. The title itself,\ndespite its obvious etymological implications, is today unhelpful. It\nwould seem to indicate a philosophy \u2018professing to achieve a\nknowledge of God by spiritual ecstasy, direct intuition or special\nindividual relations\u2019 (COD). Rosmini, however, is\nconcerned here only with reasoning about God, and takes the word\n\u2018theosophy\u2019 in its fundamental meaning of \u2018wisdom about\nGod\u2019 in so far as God is the supreme Being and the apex of\nphilosophical speculation. Such speculation must sooner or later deal\nwith the problem of the One Being and many beings, with unity and\nplurality in all their manifestations. In many ways, the book is a\ndirect challenge to Hegel and Schelling with whose philosophy Rosmini\nhad become thoroughly familiar as a result of the great editions of\ntheir works published in the 1830s and early 1840s. Kant\u2019s teaching,\nalready challenged in Rosmini\u2019s A New Essay concerning the Origin\nof Ideas, was now to be opposed in what Rosmini perceived as the\ndelirium and exaggerations of Kant\u2019s Idealist successors.\nWhenever we try to reduce the whole human being to\nspeculation, and substitute the part for the whole, we presume that all\nhuman good must lie solely in speculation. As result, we make every\neffort to turn what is real into an idea; we try to derive from the\nidea the matter which constitutes the sensible world, together with the\nSpirit and finally God himself\u2026 But although Schelling and Hegel\nclaimed that they had reached such total science, they still needed to\nteach it publicly not only for the sake of attaining the practice of\nvirtue (which would make it worthwhile), but even to draw a salary.\nThis proves without doubt that their absolute idea did not contain\neverything. If the world were present in it, as they said it was,\nwheat, bread and wine would have been there also. My theosophy\ncertainly cannot give the public such magnificent and wonderful\npromises, but it will explain how the speculative human mind is\ninclined to find everything in itself. In other words, it will\ndemonstrate that there must be an object which contains effectively\nwithin itself the universality of things, and that this object is not\nthe idea in our mind. Nevertheless, the idea which shines in the human\nmind draws its form as object from that object. Hence, because the idea\nalso is per se object, we easily confuse it, in our\nspeculation, with the complete, subsistent object. A strong desire then\narises in us of attributing to the idea which we intuit the attributes\nof the subsistent object which we know must exist, although we do not\nintuit it. The tendency to unity, an essential element of every\nintellect, causes this error and forces us towards an abyss of unseen\nabsurdities in the hope that these will satisfy our desperate purpose.\nWe should acknowledge (and this theosophy will demonstrate) that if\nbeing itself has an objective existence, it is per se\nintelligible, and that if it contains everything (that which is not\nbeing is nothing), everything must also be contained in that which is\nintelligible. Theosophy will also clearly show that, although being\nmust actually have this primal form, human nature cannot intuit the\nintelligible which contains all. Human nature arrives at this\nsolely by reasoning, which can provide only a formal, negative concept\nof it. We cannot therefore have either the absolute knowledge which\nSchelling attributes to us through direct intuition, or the absolute\nidea which his disciple, George Hegel (who was opposed to all\nimmediacy), promised us by mediate reasoning\u2026 (TH, vol.\n1, Preface, 9\u201310)\n\n\nBut the main thrust of the work is positive, rather than\ncritical.\nTheosophy will not be wasting time by demonstrating that\nbehind this well-conceived and ingenious error [of Hegel] lies a great\ntruth which those courageous speculative minds [Schelling and Hegel]\ntried in vain to grasp but could not. This truth is precisely the\nnecessity I spoke of: there must be \u2018something intelligible and\neternal which contains everything\u2019... Nevertheless, although\nabsolute knowledge is proper to God but not to us, we do have an\nabsolute knowledge relative to form, but not to matter (cf.\nNE, vol. 1, 325, 474\u2013476). This kind of absoluteness of human\nknowledge caused errors in the German school, which I have already\ndiscussed. Theosophy must speak at length about absolute human\nknowledge, indeed it must use it and more importantly be it. Theosophy\nis simply the Theory of Ens (this definition is not to be despised,\ndespite its being only two words). Because ens is first of all infinite\nand absolute, and only later enclosed and existing within limits as\nfinite, no thought could attain it unless thought itself somehow became\nabsolute. A thought informed by an object which is in some way\nabsolute, is itself in some way made absolute. Plato therefore rightly\ncalled the treatise on what is greatest, the treatise about ens. There\nis nothing in the universe or in our mind antecedent to ens or being.\nWhen, in the order of things, we remove being, nothing remains except\ndarkness in the order of cognition. For this reason the doctrine of\nens, which I call \u2018theosophy\u2019, corresponds to the concept of\nphilosophy in the ancients. According to them, philosophy differs from\nother sciences in that all other sciences suppose undemonstrated\nprinciples. Philosophy, however, which borrows nothing from anywhere,\nuses its own materials to construct itself. It starts from no\ngratuitous hypothesis or supposition\u2014on the contrary, it seeks and\nestablishes what is undemonstrable, which gives it an unshakeable\nbasis, and admits only what is necessary (Ibid.,\n10\u201312).\n\n\nFor Rosmini, the problem of being is finally considered under the\nthree divisions of the science of theosophy: ontology, rational\ntheology and cosmology, each of which must enter into the other if the\nscience is to be complete. In fact, he maintains, it is impossible to\nspeak of being in all its universal essence (ontology), without regard\nto the infinity and absoluteness of Being (rational theology), just as\nit is impossible to consider the world philosophically (cosmology)\nwithout taking its cause into consideration. Each of the three\ndivisions of theosophy is as essential to the whole as, according to\nhis example, the various vital organs are necessary to the existence of\nan animal. But the centre and substance of the whole treatise is\nteaching about God, without which there is no final explanation of the\nbeing or the world. Theosophy, therefore, is a single science which,\nthrough its division into three parts, is both one and three. Such an\naffirmation is paradigmatic of the thrust of Rosmini\u2019s theosophy which\neventually enables him to confront this rational science with the\ndoctrine of the Trinity.\n9.1 Ontology\n\n\nOntology, according to Rosmini\u2019s description of it, considers being\nin all its universality, but only as the object of human thought which\nputs limited, intellectual beings in contact with the possibility of\nall that is, not with actuality (it is impossible, for instance, to\nassuage hunger by thinking about a meal). Thought must, therefore,\nreach out to absolute reality not through direct perception of God, but\nby means of concepts. Ontology, dealing with these concepts\nanalytically and synthetically is, as it were, an immense preface to\nrational theology. Ontology as the theory of being in all its\npossibility is the necessary propedeutic to theology as the theory of\nabsolute being without which ontology itself is inevitably incomplete,\nand cannot progress beyond a treatise on categories and on\ndialectic.\n9.2 Rational theology\n\n\nIf, as Rosmini suggests, ontology is the \u2018theory of abstract\nbeing\u2019, rational theology is the \u2018theory of subsistent\nBeing\u2019. These two parts of theosophy cannot, however, can be\ndistinguished only if the same universal concepts, of which both are\nformed, can in some way be differentiated. This is done by considering\nthat ontology serves to find, review, and describe the nature and\nrelationship of these concepts; theology, in Rosmini\u2019s understanding,\nsynthesises them to form a single concept of the infinite Being. It is\ntrue that such a concept remains abstract (the essence contained in the\nconcept is not beheld by the knowing subject), but the\n\u2018theologian\u2019 passes from the concept to affirm subsistent\nBeing, which is therefore no longer a mere concept, but something which\nmust exist in itself. An effort is then made in rational theology to\nsee how the ontological concepts have their truth and their foundation\nin first subsistent Being. While this takes place, the concepts\nthemselves are identified and become one. Their separation, now\nconsidered anew, is seen to be relative not to first subsistent Being,\nbut to the beholding, finite mind. The problem of the One and the many\nis rooted not in the nature of absolute, subsistent Being, but in being\nby participation.\n9.3 Cosmology\n\n\nOntology, while a preface to rational theology, is also necessary\nfor knowledge of the intimate nature of finite being and the world.\nRosmini posits three reasons for this. First, although finite being is\nperceived, perception is limited to very few beings. If the essential\nconditions of this being are to be known, it is necessary to know the\ncommon conditions of all finite beings. This cannot be done without\nrecourse to universal principles which enable us to deduce what is\nlacking to limited experience. Second, the same principles are needed\nto provide a notion of finite beings in themselves, divested of the\nsensory phenomena that accompany their perception. Third, subsistent\nBeing, if known, would be intelligible per se. This is not the\ncase with finite beings, which are known through their participation in\nintellectual light, and consequently remain unknown without some\nrelationship to concepts.\n",
