    "main_text": "On Nature || Roots and Forces\n2.1 Roots and Forces\n\nOn Nature is based on the claim that everything is composed\nof four roots; these are moved by two opposing forces, Love and\nStrife.\n\n\nHear first of all the four roots of all things:\nZeus the gleaming, Hera who gives life, Aidoneus,\nAnd N\u00eastis, who moistens with her tears the mortal fountain.\n(B6 = D 57)\n\n\n\nSince the roots are identified by the names of deities\u2014and not\nby the traditional names for the elements fire, earth, air, and\nwater\u2014there are rival interpretations of which deity is to be\nidentified with which root. Nevertheless, there is general agreement\nthat the passage refers to fire, earth, air (= aither, the upper,\natmospheric air, rather than the air that we breathe here on earth)\nand water (cf. B 109 = D 207). Aristotle credits Empedocles with being\nthe first to distinguish clearly these four elements\n(Metaphysics. 985a31\u20133). However, the fact that the\nroots have divinities\u2019 names indicates that each has an active\nnature and is not just inert matter (Rowett 2016). These roots and\nforces are eternal and equally balanced, although the influence of\nLove and of Strife waxes and wanes (B 6 and B 17.14\u201320 = D 57\nand D 73.245\u201351).\n\nIn fragment 17 of Diels-Kranz, apparently speaking of the physical\nworld as a whole, Empedocles states his fundamental thesis about the\nrelation of roots and forces:\n\n\n\nTwofold is what I shall say: for at one time they [i.e., the elements]\ngrew to be only one \n\nOut of many, at another time again they separate to be many out of\none. \n\nAnd double is the birth of mortal things, double their death. \n\nFor the one [i.e., birth] is both born and destroyed by the coming\ntogether of all things, \n\nWhile the other inversely, when they are separated, is nourished and\nflies apart (?). \n\nAnd these [scil. the elements] incessantly exchange their places\ncontinually, \n\nSometimes by Love all coming together into one, \n\nSometimes again each one carried off by the hatred of Strife. \n\n<Thus insofar as they have learned to grow as one out of many,>\n\n\nAnd inversely, the one separating again, they end up being many, \n\nTo that extent they become, and they do not have a steadfast lifetime;\n\n\nBut insofar as they incessantly exchange their places continually, \n\nTo that extent they always are, immobile in a circle. (B 17.1\u201313\n= D 73) \n\n\n\nImmediately one is struck by the comprehensive symmetry of this\nscheme. It seems to address coming-to-be and passing-away, birth and\ndeath, and it does so with an elegant balance. The four roots come\ntogether and blend, under the agency of Love, and they are driven\napart by Strife. At the same time, elements have an active drive\ntoward homogenization on the principal of affinity (Primavesi 2016).\nWhile this passage describes periods when one of the forces is\ndominant, it also describes a cycle. One force does not finally\ntriumph over the other; rather, their periods of dominance succeed one\nanother in continual alternation.\n\nEmpedocles argues that these roots and forces do not pass away nor is\nanything added to them. They are the permanent constituents of the\ncyclic drama just described:\n\n\n\nFor these are all equal and identical in age, \n\nBut each one presides over a different honor, each one has its own\ncharacter, \n\nAnd by turns they dominate while the time revolves. \n\nAnd besides these, nothing at all is added nor is lacking; \n\nFor if they perished entirely, they would no longer be. \n\nAnd this whole here, what could increase it, and coming from where? \n\nAnd how could it be completely destroyed, since nothing is empty of\nthese? \n\nBut these are themselves, but running the ones through the others \n\nThey become now this, now that, and each time are continually similar.\n(B 17.27\u201335 = D 73.258\u2013266) \n\n\n\nWe find similar terminology in Parmenides\u2019 poem when he argues\nthat the All is one and that it does not come to be:\n\n\n\nAnd was not, nor will it be at some time, since it is now, together,\nwhole \n\nOne, continuous. For what birth could you seek for it? \n\nHow, from what could it have grown? (B 8.5\u20137 = D 8.10\u201312).\n\n\n\nOf course, a notorious consequence of Parmenides\u2019 argument is\nthe impossibility of plurality and of the world of change that we\nexperience. By contrast, Empedocles argues for a plurality of\npermanent entities, i.e., the roots and forces. By incorporating\nplurality into his account, he can explain the changing world of our\nexperience as the combination and disaggregation of the enduring roots\nunder the influence of the enduring forces. \n",
