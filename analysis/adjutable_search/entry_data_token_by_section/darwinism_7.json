    "main_text": "The Five Core Philosophical Problems Today || Selection, Adaptation and Teleology\n3.4 Species and the Concept of \u2018Species\u2019\n\n\nIn listing the topics I would discuss under the heading of neo-Darwinism, I\ndistinguished the question of the ontological status of species from\nthe epistemological status of the species concept.\nThough they are closely related questions, it is important to keep them\ndistinct. As will become clear as we proceed, this distinction is\nrarely honored. Moreover, it is equally important to distinguish\nthe species concept from the categories of features that\nbelong in a definition of species (Rheins 2011). Advances in our theoretical\nunderstanding may lead us to reconsider the sorts of attributes that\nare most important for determining whether a group of organisms is a\nspecies, and thus whether it deserves to be assigned a name at that\ntaxonomic level. It should not be assumed that such changes\nconstitute a change in the species concept, though at least some such\nchanges may lead us to restrict or expand the range of taxa that are\ndesignated as species. In his contribution to the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis,\nSystematics and the Origin of Species, Ernst Mayr titled\nchapter five \u2018The Systematic Categories and the New Species\nConcept\u2019. Recall that Darwin made a point of treating the\nspecies category as continuous with \u2018well-marked variety\u2019\nand \u2018sub-species\u2019, and made the radical suggestion that its\nboundaries would be just as fluid. Without explicitly\nacknowledging Darwin, Mayr takes the same tack, discussing\n\u2018individual variants\u2019 and \u2018sub-species\u2019 as a\npreliminary to discussing the species concept. Mayr notes that\nfor someone studying the evolutionary process, speciation is a critical\njuncture; \u201c\u2026his interpretation of the speciation process\ndepends largely on what he considers to be the final stage of this\nprocess, the species.\u201d (Mayr 1942/1982, 113) With this in\nmind, he offers the following definition, the so-called\n\u2018biological species concept\u2019 (BSC):\n\nSpecies are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding\nnatural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such\ngroups (Mayr 1942/1982, 120; 1976 518)\n\n\nMayr was well aware of the limitations of this definition, and\ntreated it somewhat as a \u2018regulative ideal\u2019.\nDobzhansky in 1937 gave what he claimed to be a definition of species,\nbut which seems, as Mayr noted (Mayr 1976 481), much more a definition\nof speciation:\n\n\n\u2026that stage of evolutionary process, \u201cat which the once\nactually or potentially interbreeding array of forms becomes segregated\nin two or more separate arrays which are physiologically incapable of\ninterbreeding.\u201d (312)\n\n\nSimpson (1943) and others built even more historicity into the\nconcept. These are all, of course, intended as\ndefinitions of the species category, and they attempt\nto provide a test (or a \u2018yardstick\u2019: Mayr 1976 479) that in\nprinciple will permit a researcher to decide whether a group of\nindividuals should all be identified by a single species-level concept\nsuch as \u2018homo sapiens\u2019. The test for species\nmembership is the capacity to interbreed; the test\ndistinguishing two species is incapacity to interbreed.\nDobzhansky makes the importance of this test transparent\u2014the\ntransition from a single interbreeding population to two reproductively\nisolated ones is the process of speciation.\n\n\nNow in each of these definitions, little attention is paid to the actual\nmethods used by taxonomists and systematists in differentiating between\nvarieties of a species and distinct species, something to which Darwin\ngave a great deal of attention. Darwin\u2019s apparent nominalism\nregarding the species concept likely stemmed from his close attention\nto his own taxonomic practices and those of other specialists. But\nnominalism typically combines a view about the ontology of\nspecies with one about the epistemological status of the species\nconcept. On the first question, the nominalist insists\nthat there are no species\u2014there are more or less similar\nindividuals. On the second question, the nominalist typically\ninsists that the species concept is, at best, a useful or\nconvenient grouping of similar individuals or, at worst, an\narbitrary grouping of similar individuals. (An interesting\nalternative account of the species concept based on a sophisticated,\nmultidimensional theory of similarity has recently been defended in\nRheins 2011.)  \n\n\nIn his work, Mayr relates different approaches to the species\nconcept to the philosophical distinction between essentialism and\nnominalism. He associates essentialism with the view that a\nspecies concept refers to a universal or type. This view\nof the referent of the concept leads to the Typological Species\nConcept, which he traces from Linnaeus back to Plato and Aristotle, and which he\nclaims \u2018is now universally abandoned\u2019 (1976 516). It is\nworth noting that serious doubt has been cast both on the historical\nand the philosophical credentials of Mayr\u2019s \u2018Typological\nSpecies Concept\u2019 (see, e.g. Lennox, 1987; repr. in Lennox 2001b;\nWinsor 2001, 2006; Walsh 2006; Wilkins 2009). At the opposite extreme is\nnominalism, which combines the view that only individuals exist in\nnature and that species are concepts invented for the purpose of\ngrouping these individuals collectively.\n\n\nMayr claims that his Biological Species Concept (BSC) is an advance\non both; individual species members are objectively related to one\nanother not by a shared relation to a type but by causal and historical\nrelationships to one another. He can thus\nbe understood as arguing for a new, objective way of understanding the\nepistemological grounds for grouping individuals into species.\nThis new way of grouping stresses historical, genetic and various\necological relationships among the individuals as the grounds for\ndetermining species membership. His claim is that this is more\nreliable and objective than similarities of phenotypic\ncharacteristics. This makes sense of the importance he eventually\nplaces on the fact the BSC defines species relationally:\n\n\n\u2026species are relationally defined. The word species\ncorresponds very closely to other relational terms such as, for\ninstance, the word brother. \u2026 To be a different species\nis not a matter of degree of difference but of relational distinctness.\n(Mayr 1976, 518)\n\n\nMayr has in mind that brothers may or may not look alike; the\nquestion of whether two people are brothers is determined by their\nhistorical and genetic ties to a common ancestry. Notice,\nhowever, that this is a claim about which characteristics, among the many\nthat they have, should be taken most seriously in\ndetermining the applicability to them of the concept\n\u2018brother\u2019. That is, it is a defense of a sort of\nessentialism.\n\n\nA number of critics have pointed out that essentialism need not be\ncommitted to \u2018types\u2019 understood as universalia in\nre; and on certain accounts of essences any species taxon that\nmeets the standards of BSC does so in virtue of certain essential\n(though relational and historical) properties. At one extreme,\nMichael Ghiselin and David Hull have argued that this causal/historical\nstructure of species provides grounds, at least within evolutionary\nbiology, for considering species to be\n individuals.[15]\n Organisms are\nnot members of a class or set, but \u2018parts\u2019 of a\nphylogenetic unit. Taking a very different tack, Denis Walsh has\nrecently argued that a form of \u2018evolutionary essentialism,\u2019\nbearing a striking resemblance to the essentialism of Aristotle\u2019s\nzoological work, is implicit in the work of a number of evolutionary\ndevelopmental theorists (Walsh, 2006).\n\n\nA critical issue in this debate over the account of the species\nconcept most appropriate for Darwinism is the extent to which the\nprocess of biological classification\u2014taxonomy\u2014should be\ninformed by advances in biological theory. Besides those already\ndiscussed, the moderate pluralism associated with Robert Brandon and\nBrent Mischler or the more radical pluralism defended by Philip\nKitcher, argues that different explanatory aims within the biological\nsciences will require different criteria for determining whether a\ngroup constitutes a species. Cladists, on the other hand, employ\nstrictly defined phylogenetic tests to determine species\nrank (see Rheins 2011). \n\n\nUnlike many of the other topics that define the history of\nDarwinism, there is no clear-cut position on this question that can be\nidentified as \u2018Darwinian\u2019 or\n\u2018neo-Darwinian\u2019. In a recent collection of papers\ndefending most of the alternatives currently being advanced (Ereshefsky\n1992), my suspicion is that virtually every author in that collection would identify\nhimself as Darwinian. This may be because, as different as they\nare, a number of positions currently being defended have their roots in\nDarwin\u2019s own theory and practice (see Beatty 1985; reprinted in\nEreshefsky 1992).\n",
