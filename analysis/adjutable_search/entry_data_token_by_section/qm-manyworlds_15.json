    "main_text": "Objections to the MWI\n6. Objections to the MWI\n\nSome of the objections to the MWI follow from misinterpretations due\nto the multitude of various MWIs. The terminology of the MWI can be\nconfusing: \u201cworld\u201d is \u201cuniverse\u201d in Deutsch\n1996, while \u201cuniverse\u201d is \u201cmultiverse\u201d. There\nare two very different approaches with the same name \u201cThe\nMany-Minds Interpretation (MMI)\u201d. The MMI of Albert and Loewer\n1988 mentioned above should not be confused with the MMI of Lockwood\net al. 1996 (which resembles the approach of Zeh 1981).\nFurther, the MWI in the Heisenberg representation, Deutsch 2002,\ndiffers significantly from the MWI presented in the Schr\u00f6dinger\nrepresentation (used here). The MWI presented here is very close to\nEverett\u2019s original proposal, but in the entry on\n Everett\u2019s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics,\n as well as in his book, Barrett 1999, uses the name \u201cMWI\u201d\nfor the splitting worlds view publicized by De Witt 1970. This\napproach has been justly criticized: it has both some kind of collapse\n(an irreversible splitting of worlds in a preferred basis) and the\nmultitude of worlds. Now we consider some objections in detail.\n",
