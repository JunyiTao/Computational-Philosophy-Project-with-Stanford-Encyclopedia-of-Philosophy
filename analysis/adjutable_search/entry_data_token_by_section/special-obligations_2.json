Special Obligations and Natural Duties\n\nAlthough commonsense morality seems firmly committed to special\nobligations, and seems firmly committed to an understanding of such\nobligations that cannot be accommodated by consequentialism,\ndifficulties remain in trying to provide some grounds for such\nobligations. We can see these difficulties more clearly if we contrast\nspecial obligations with a type of duty recognized by commonsense\nmorality that is not special, i.e., natural duties. Natural duties are\n\u201cmoral requirements which apply to all men [and women]\nirrespective of status or of acts performed\u2026owed by all persons\nto all others\u201d (Simmons 1979, 13). It is plausible to suppose\nthat the fundamental or basic justification of why we have natural\nduties is the intrinsic nature of persons, i.e., the intrinsic nature\nof those to whom the duties are owed (moral patients). For example,\nconsider my duty to tell the person sitting next to me at a bar that\nJoe Schmoe slipped poison into her drink. It may seem to be the case\nthat I am morally required to tell only a limited class of people that\nsomeone has put poison into their drink, namely, the class consisting\nof the person sitting next to me right now whose drink is such that I\nknow that it is poisoned. However, the fundamental or basic\njustification for my having that duty is the nature of the person to\nwhom the duty is owed \u2013 she is rational, or sentient, or\n[substitute your preferred characterization of a moral patient]\n\u2013 and her nature is sufficient to ground the duty. My proximity\nto the person and my knowledge of the poison in her drink facilitate\nmy being able to fulfill my (natural) duty of mutual aid, but it is\nnot a part of the fundamental explanation of why I have such a duty in\nthe first place. So it is the nature of the action, i.e., warning the\nrelevant sort of being of imminent danger, that renders the action\nmorally required. Anyone else in the same causal and epistemic\nposition would similarly have a duty to warn of the poison in the\ndrink. I occupy no peculiar status or role and have performed no prior\nactions such that if I did not occupy that role or had not performed\nthose actions, I would have no duty to warn of the poison in the\ndrink.\n\nSpecial obligations, on the other hand, are owed not (necessarily) to\nall persons, but to some (possibly) limited class of\n persons,[1]\n where the fundamental or basic justification for the having of such\nobligations cannot be the intrinsic nature of the obligee as such (or,\nat least, not only the intrinsic nature of the obligee: the obligee\nmust have the requisite properties in order to qualify as a moral\npatient before she can be owed any obligations or duties at all.)\nAfter all, those to whom I owe special obligations are not necessarily\nmore worthy or needy (and are certainly not more sentient or rational)\nthan those to whom I do not owe any special obligations. Rather, the\nrelationship between me and my obligee is fundamental to any\nexplanation of my special obligations to that obligee. Consider, for\nexample, my obligation to keep my promise to you to remind you,\nwhenever you start to drink alcohol, that you have given it up for\nLent. The fundamental explanation of why I have an obligation to\nremind you that you have given up alcohol for Lent is not that you\nhave the requisite features to qualify as a moral patient in\nconjunction with the nature of the action of reminding persons when\nthey have given up alcohol as part of a religious commitment. My\nrelation to you (my status as defined by past action), i.e.that I have\nmade a promise to you, does not simply facilitate my fulfilling some\nmore general duty, but, rather, is part of the basic explanation of\nwhy I have the obligation to remind you of your commitment. (There are\ndifficulties with this specification of special obligations as opposed\nto natural duties. In order to remove the difficulties, one would need\nto explain why certain contingent features of persons such as causal\nposition are not partly constitutive of \u2018status\u2019 or best\nseen as a result of \u2018acts performed.\u2019 In other words, one\nwho intends to attribute to moral agents some type of genuinely\nspecial obligation owes an account of what sorts of status or position\nor what types of acts performed are such that, as a result of being in\nsuch a position or having performed such acts, one has obligations\nthat are not derived from some more general obligation that one has to\nall persons considered as\n such.[2]).\n\nAs I have said, common sense morality seems to regard persons as\nhaving certain special obligations, in particular, special obligations\nto one\u2019s friends, one\u2019s family, those persons to whom one\nhas made a promise, and one\u2019s fellow citizens. As I indicated in\nthe first section, appeal to these special obligations has often been\nused as a weapon against the consequentialist: persons have special\nobligations, consequentialism cannot accommodate such obligations,\ntherefore consequentialism is false. As I have said, the\nconsequentialist has attempted to show the ways in which she can\njustify our acting as though we have special obligations, but must\ndeny that we actually have any non-derivative special obligations. The\nconsequentialist can, at this point, join forces with any moral\ntheorist who accepts natural duties while rejecting special\nobligations. Consequentialists and defenders of natural duties base\nthe duties that they defend on some intrinsic feature of the state of\naffairs to be promoted or of the person to whom the duty is owed. They\ncan then press the defender of special obligations to offer some\naccount of the grounds of alleged non-derivative special obligations:\nwhy suppose that we have reasons to benefit some persons merely\nbecause of some special relationship that we stand in to those\npersons, our own status or position, or past actions that we have\nperformed?\n\nThis demand of the consequentialist is backed by a particular and\nfamiliar understanding of the nature of moral demands. Morality, it\nseems to many people, requires us to be impartial between persons, not\ngiving special consideration to anyone merely on the basis of\nirrelevant features. Deviations from such impartiality often appear\nmorally odious, as the world\u2019s history of racism, sexism,\nreligious bigotry, homophobia, etc. demonstrate all too clearly. But\nspecial obligations are a deviation from impartiality, as they offer\nsupport to our being partial to those persons who stand in special\nrelationships to us. A defense of special obligations, then, requires\na defense of morality as involving both partial and impartial demands\n(see Cottingham). Instead of deviating from an impartial conception of\nmorality, some philosophers have instead claimed that special\nrelationships such as friendship generate their own, non-moral reasons\nof partiality (Cocking and Kennett), while others have followed Samuel\nScheffler (1994) in claiming that we have permissions or\nagent-centered prerogatives that allow us to deviate from impartial\nmoral demands in certain contexts. And, of course, another option is\nto deny that we are justified in acting partially even in contexts in\nwhich such partiality is generally accepted. (See, for example,\nGomberg, for a defense of the claim that partiality to compatriots is\nno more justified than is racism.)\n",
