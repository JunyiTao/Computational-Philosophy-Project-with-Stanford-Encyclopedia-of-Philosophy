    "main_text": "The Classical Era\n2. The Classical Era\n\nA small amount of historical context will be useful before we begin.\nThe Zhou people conquer the Shang in approximately 1046 BCE, and for\nthe next several hundred years, the central plains of what is now\nChina were either ruled directly by the Zhou king, or else by elite\nfamilies loyal to the Zhou, in a kind of feudal system. By the Spring\nand Autumn era (771 BCE\u2013476 BCE), the power of the feudal lords\nhad eclipsed that of the Zhou king, but a rough peace still prevailed\nwith different feudal lords acting as \u201chegemon\n(ba)\u201d. This system then breaks down and the\npre-Imperial period enters its final stage, the Warring States era\n(often dated 475 BCE\u2013221 BCE), which received its name from the\nincessant warfare conducted between the realms that established\nthemselves as independent powers after the effective demise of the\nZhou dynasty. Not only was warfare common in this period; it was also\nincreasingly vast in scope, as the chariot armies of the elite made\nway for much larger conscript-based armies. This change was in turn\nrelated to the increasing abilities of states to raise, organize, and\nfeed such large armies. Both larger populations and more complex\ngovernmental structures lay behind these developments. All these\ninter-related developments, finally, both drove and were shaped by the\nera\u2019s social and political philosophies. The texts that we\nexamine here all date from the Warring States era, a period of\npluralistic debate that establishes key terms and questions addressed\nby Chinese thinkers for many centuries thereafter. Three general,\nprovocative treatments of this era are El Amine 2015, Bai 2012, and\nPines 2012, and Hsiao 1979 is a classic account of the subject.\n",
