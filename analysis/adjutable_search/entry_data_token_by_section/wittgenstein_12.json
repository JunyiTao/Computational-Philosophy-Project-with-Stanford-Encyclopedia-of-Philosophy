    "main_text": "The Later Wittgenstein || Interpretative Problems\n3.8 Interpretative Problems\n\nWhereas the Tractatus has been interpreted in different ways\nright from its publication, for about two decades since the\npublication of Philosophical Investigations in 1953 there\nseemed to be wide agreement on the proper way to read the book (along\nwith the vast material from 1930 onwards in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nNachlass, gradually released over the years).\nWittgenstein\u2019s turn from his early emphasis on the role of\nlogical analysis in his philosophical method to the later preference\nof particular grammatical descriptions was read, quite unanimously, as\nmarking the two clearly distinct \u2013 \u201cearly\u201d and\n\u201clater\u201d \u2013 phases in his thought. The later phase, it\nwas agreed, consisted mainly of particular descriptions of our\nordinary uses of words \u2013 especially those words which tend to\ncreate the illusion that they represent something profound, words\nwhich seem to point at the \u201cessence of language.\u201d\n\u201cWhereas, in fact, if the words \u2018language,\u2019\n\u2018experience,\u2019 \u2018world\u2019 have a use, it must be\nas humble a one as that of the words \u2018table,\u2019\n\u2018lamp,\u2019 \u2018door\u2019.\u201d (PI 97)\n\nWith the publication of Stanley Cavell\u2019s Must We Mean What\nWe Say? (1969) and especially The Claim of Reason:\nWittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy (1979), it turned\nout that such notions as \u2018description,\u2019\n\u2018ordinary,\u2019 and \u2018usage\u2019 are not as innocuous\nas they had seemed. Cavell\u2019s reading of Philosophical\nInvestigations suggested a more radical emphasis on the\nparticularity of contexts and blocked the way to any general\ndescription of \u201cgrammatical rules.\u201d For Cavell,\nWittgenstein\u2019s idea that meanings are determined only\nwithin language games, i.e., only in particular cases, is the\nkey to reading his philosophy. When ignored, we are bound to import an\noutside requirement into our investigation and thus, favoring a\ndistilled and rigid account of our linguistic exchanges, miss (and\nmisrepresent) their vividness: \u201cAs if the meaning were an aura\nthe word brings along with it and retains in every kind of use\u201d\n(PI 117).\n\nIn 1980, Oxford philosophers G.P. Baker and P.M.S. Hacker launched the\nfirst volume of an analytical commentary on Wittgenstein\u2019s\nInvestigations. This gigantic project, spanning over 4\nvolumes (the 3rd and 4th written by Hacker\nalone), advocated and developed the orthodox reading of\nWittgenstein\u2019s later work, according to which a systematic\nmapping \u2013 an overview, or \u00dcbersicht (Cf.\nPI 122) \u2013 of the use of our words is not only possible\nbut also necessary, if we wish to dissolve the philosophical problems\narising from the traditional philosophical inattention to ordinary\nuse, due to a prior metaphysical requirement. For Baker and Hacker, a\nkey notion for reading Wittgenstein\u2019s later philosophy is that\nof philosophical \u2018grammar.\u2019 Acute attention to grammatical\nrules of use offers a way to elucidate meanings and thus to expose\nphilosophical blunders.\n\nGradually, these alternatives in reading Philosophical\nInvestigations came to form two schools of interpretation that\nare broadly parallel to the ones we encounter regarding\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus. As noted above (in section\n2.4), there is, first, the question of the continuity between\nWittgenstein\u2019s earlier and later writings. When emphasis is\ngiven \u2013 as in the orthodox reading \u2013 to\nWittgenstein\u2019s switch from logic to grammar, the break between\nthe philosophical stages is easily marked. When, on the contrary, it\nis the resistance to generalization (of any kind) that is emphasized,\nthen the similarity in Wittgenstein\u2019s therapeutic motivation\nthroughout his life is much more clearly seen.\n\nAs in the previous stage, the debate here has to do with the question\nof ethics and its centrality in reading Wittgenstein\u2019s oeuvre.\nAccording to the traditional approach, amplified in Hacker and\nBaker\u2019s interpretive project, Wittgenstein\u2019s main\nobjective is to resolve or dissolve general philosophical puzzles\n\u2013 concerning, e.g., the mind, the nature of color, perception,\nand rule-following \u2013 by clarifying, arranging, and contrasting\ndifferent grammatical rules relevant to the notion examined. This is\nan intellectual investigation and, apart from its being critical of\ntraditional philosophy and its reflection in contemporary science, it\nhas nothing particularly relevant to ethics and should not be read as\nan ethical endeavor. Readers taking their cue from Cavell, on the\nother hand, believe that the gist of the Wittgensteinian effort in\ntoto is ethical, cultural, or even political. They point at the\nInvestigations\u2019 motto (\u201cThe trouble about\nprogress is that it always looks much greater than it really is\u201d\n\u2013 Nestroy) and Wittgenstein\u2019s mention of \u201cthe\ndarkness of this time\u201d in the book\u2019s Preface; but more\nsubstantially, they argue that Wittgenstein\u2019s insistence on the\nordinary, the practice of every-day living, is ethical through and\nthrough. Our lives are saturated by ethics; we are members of a\nhistorically and culturally conditioned society; and our linguistic\npractices cannot but have an important ethical aspect. Ignoring this\naspect, according to these interpreters, entails a rejection of what\nis human in our linguistic exchanges.\n\nTo be sure, the interpretations\u2019 map is much more complicated\nthan what is briefly sketched here. There are philosophers who object\nto the characterization each side in the above debate attaches to the\nother. There are those who claim that while there is a genuine dispute\nabout the right interpretation of the Tractatus, the various\ninterpreters of Philosophical Investigations are much closer\nto one another than they are ready to acknowledge; and there are\nindependent readings of Wittgenstein which draw their clues from both\nsides and attempt a different path altogether.\n",
