For the most\npart, aesthetic theories have divided over questions\nparticular to one or another of these designations: whether\nartworks are necessarily aesthetic objects; how to square the\nallegedly perceptual basis of aesthetic judgments with the fact that\nwe give reasons in support of them; how best to capture the elusive\ncontrast between an aesthetic attitude and a practical one; whether to\ndefine aesthetic experience according to its phenomenological or\nrepresentational content; how best to understand the relation between\naesthetic value and aesthetic experience. But questions of more\ngeneral nature have lately arisen, and these have tended to\nhave a skeptical cast: whether any use of \u2018aesthetic\u2019 may\nbe explicated without appeal to some other; whether agreement\nrespecting any use is sufficient to ground meaningful theoretical\nagreement or disagreement; whether the term ultimately answers to any\nlegitimate philosophical purpose that justifies its inclusion in the\nlexicon. The skepticism expressed by such general questions did not\nbegin to take hold until the later part of the 20th century, and this\nfact prompts the question whether (a) the concept of the aesthetic is\ninherently problematic and it is only recently that we have managed to\nsee that it is, or (b) the concept is fine and it is only recently\nthat we have become muddled enough to imagine otherwise. Adjudicating\nbetween these possibilities requires a vantage from which to take in\nboth early and late theorizing on aesthetic matters.\n", "toc": [{"#ConTas": "1.

The Concept of Taste\n\nThe concept of the aesthetic descends from the concept of taste. Why\nthe concept of taste commanded so much philosophical attention during\nthe 18th century is a complicated matter, but this much is clear: the\neighteenth-century theory of taste emerged, in part, as a corrective\nto the rise of rationalism, particularly as applied to beauty, and to\nthe rise of egoism, particularly as applied to virtue. Against\nrationalism about beauty, the eighteenth-century theory of taste held\nthe judgment of beauty to be immediate; against egoism about virtue,\nit held the pleasure of beauty to be disinterested.\n1.1 Immediacy\n\nRationalism about beauty is the view that judgments of beauty are\njudgments of reason, i.e., that we judge things to be beautiful by\nreasoning it out, where reasoning it out typically involves inferring\nfrom principles or applying concepts. At the beginning of the 18th\ncentury, rationalism about beauty had achieved dominance on the\ncontinent, and was being pushed to new extremes by \u201cles\ng\u00e9om\u00e8tres,\u201d a group of literary theorists who\naimed to bring to literary criticism the mathematical rigor that\nDescartes had brought to physics. As one such theorist put it:\n\nThe way to think about a literary problem is that pointed out by\nDescartes for problems of physical science. A critic who tries any\nother way is not worthy to be living in the present century. There is\nnothing better than mathematics as propaedeutic for literary\ncriticism. (Terrasson 1715, Preface, 65; quoted in Wimsatt and Brooks\n1957, 258)\n\n\nIt was against this, and against more moderate forms of rationalism\nabout beauty, that mainly British philosophers working mainly within\nan empiricist framework began to develop theories of taste. The\nfundamental idea behind any such theory\u2014which we may call\nthe immediacy thesis\u2014is that judgments of beauty are\nnot (or at least not canonically) mediated by inferences from\nprinciples or applications of concepts, but rather have all the\nimmediacy of straightforwardly sensory judgments. It is the idea, in\nother words, that we do not reason to the conclusion that things are\nbeautiful, but rather \u201csense\u201d that they are. Here is an\nearly expression of the thesis, from Jean-Baptiste Dubos\u2019s\nCritical Reflections on Poetry, Painting, and Music, which\nfirst appeared in 1719:\n\nDo we ever reason, in order to know whether a ragoo be good or bad;\nand has it ever entered into any body\u2019s head, after having\nsettled the geometrical principles of taste, and defined the qualities\nof each ingredient that enters into the composition of those messes,\nto examine into the proportion observed in their mixture, in order to\ndecide whether it be good or bad? No, this is never practiced. We have\na sense given us by nature to distinguish whether the cook acted\naccording to the rules of his art. People taste the ragoo, and\ntho\u2019 unacquainted with those rules, they are able to tell\nwhether it be good or no. The same may be said in some respect of the\nproductions of the mind, and of pictures made to please and move us.\n(Dubos 1748, vol. II, 238\u2013239)\n\n\nAnd here is a late expression, from Kant\u2019s 1790 Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment:\n\nIf someone reads me his poem or takes me to a play that in the end\nfails to please my taste, then he can adduce Batteux or Lessing, or\neven older and more famous critics of taste, and adduce all the rules\nthey established as proofs that his poem is beautiful\u2026 . I will\nstop my ears, listen to no reasons and arguments, and would rather\nbelieve that those rules of the critics are false \u2026 than allow\nthat my judgment should be determined by means of a priori\ngrounds of proof, since it is supposed to be a judgment of taste and\nnot of the understanding of reason. (Kant 1790, 165)\n\n\nBut the theory of taste would not have enjoyed its eighteenth-century\nrun, nor would it continue now to exert its influence, had it been\nwithout resources to counter an obvious rationalist objection. There\nis a wide difference\u2014so goes the objection\u2014between judging\nthe excellence of a ragout and judging the excellence of a poem or a\nplay. More often than not, poems and plays are objects of great\ncomplication. But taking in all that complication requires a lot of\ncognitive work, including the application of concepts and the drawing\nof inferences. Judging the beauty of poems and plays, then, is\nevidently not immediate and so evidently not a matter of taste.\n\nThe chief way of meeting this objection was first to distinguish\nbetween the act of grasping the object preparatory to judging it and\nthe act of judging the object once grasped, and then to allow the\nformer, but not the latter, to be as concept- and inference-mediated\nas any rationalist might wish. Here is Hume, with characteristic\nclarity:\n\n[I]n order to pave the way for [a judgment of taste], and give a\nproper discernment of its object, it is often necessary, we find, that\nmuch reasoning should precede, that nice distinctions be made, just\nconclusions drawn, distant comparisons formed, complicated relations\nexamined, and general facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of\nbeauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first appearance\ncommand our affection and approbation; and where they fail of this\neffect, it is impossible for any reasoning to redress their influence,\nor adapt them better to our taste and sentiment. But in many orders of\nbeauty, particularly those of the fine arts, it is requisite to employ\nmuch reasoning, in order to feel the proper sentiment. (Hume, 1751,\nSection I)\n\n\nHume\u2014like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson before him, and Reid after\nhim (Cooper 1711, 17, 231; Hutcheson 1725, 16\u201324; Reid 1785,\n760\u2013761)\u2014regarded the faculty of taste as a kind of\n\u201cinternal sense.\u201d Unlike the five \u201cexternal\u201d\nor \u201cdirect\u201d senses, an \u201cinternal\u201d (or\n\u201creflex\u201d or \u201csecondary\u201d) sense is one that\ndepends for its objects on the antecedent operation of some other\nmental faculty or faculties. Reid characterizes internal sense as\nfollows:\n\nBeauty or deformity in an object, results from its nature or\nstructure. To perceive the beauty therefore, we must perceive the\nnature or structure from which it results. In this the internal sense\ndiffers from the external. Our external senses may discover qualities\nwhich do not depend upon any antecedent perception\u2026 . But it is\nimpossible to perceive the beauty of an object, without perceiving the\nobject, or at least conceiving it. (Reid 1785, 760\u2013761)\n\n\nBecause of the highly complex natures or structures of many beautiful\nobjects, there will have to be a role for reason in their perception.\nBut perceiving the nature or structure of an object is one thing.\nPerceiving its beauty is another.\n1.2 Disinterest\n\nEgoism about virtue is the view that to judge an action or trait\nvirtuous is to take pleasure in it because you believe it to serve\nsome interest of yours. Its central instance is the Hobbesian\nview\u2014still very much on early eighteenth-century\nminds\u2014that to judge an action or trait virtuous is to take\npleasure in it because you believe it to promote your safety. Against\nHobbesian egoism a number of British moralists\u2014preeminently\nShaftesbury, Hutcheson, and Hume\u2014argued that, while a judgment\nof virtue is a matter of taking pleasure in response to an action or\ntrait, the pleasure is disinterested, by which they meant that it is\nnot self-interested (Cooper 1711, 220\u2013223; Hutcheson 1725, 9,\n25\u201326; Hume 1751, 218\u2013232, 295\u2013302). One argument\nwent roughly as follows. That we judge virtue by means of an immediate\nsensation of pleasure means that judgments of virtue are judgments of\ntaste, no less than judgments of beauty. But pleasure in the beautiful\nis not self-interested: we judge objects to be beautiful whether or\nnot we believe them to serve our interests. But if pleasure in the\nbeautiful is disinterested, there is no reason to think that pleasure\nin the virtuous cannot also be (Hutcheson 1725, 9\u201310).\n\nThe eighteenth-century view that judgments of virtue are judgments of\ntaste highlights a difference between the eighteenth-century concept\nof taste and our concept of the aesthetic, since for us the concepts\naesthetic and moral tend oppose one another such\nthat a judgment\u2019s falling under one typically precludes its\nfalling under the other. Kant is chiefly responsible for introducing\nthis difference. He brought the moral and the aesthetic into\nopposition by re-interpreting what we might call the disinterest\nthesis\u2014the thesis that pleasure in the beautiful is\ndisinterested (though see Cooper 1711, 222 and Home 2005, 36\u201338\nfor anticipations of Kant\u2019s re-interpretation).\n\nAccording to Kant, to say that a pleasure is interested is not to say\nthat it is self-interested in the Hobbesian sense, but rather that it\nstands in a certain relation to the faculty of desire. The pleasure\ninvolved in judging an action to be morally good is interested because\nsuch a judgment issues in a desire to bring the action into existence,\ni.e., to perform it. To judge an action to be morally good is to\nbecome aware that one has a duty to perform the action, and to become\nso aware is to gain a desire to perform it. By contrast, the pleasure\ninvolved in judging an object to be beautiful is disinterested because\nsuch a judgment issues in no desire to do anything in particular. If\nwe can be said to have a duty with regard to beautiful things, it\nappears to be exhausted in our judging them aesthetically to be\nbeautiful. That is what Kant means when he says that the judgment of\ntaste is not practical but rather \u201cmerely contemplative\u201d\n(Kant 1790, 95).\n\nBy thus re-orienting the notion of disinterest, Kant brought the\nconcept of taste into opposition with the concept of morality, and so\ninto line, more or less, with the present concept of the aesthetic.\nBut if the Kantian concept of taste is continuous, more or less, with\nthe present-day concept of the aesthetic, why the terminological\ndiscontinuity? Why have we come to prefer the term\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 to the term \u2018taste\u2019? The not very\ninteresting answer appears to be that we have preferred an adjective\nto a noun. The term \u2018aesthetic\u2019 derives from the Greek\nterm for sensory perception, and so preserves the implication of\nimmediacy carried by the term \u2018taste.\u2019 Kant employed both\nterms, though not equivalently: according to his usage,\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 is broader, picking out a class of judgments\nthat includes both the normative judgment of taste and the\nnon-normative, though equally immediate, judgment of the agreeable.\nThough Kant was not the first modern to use \u2018aesthetic\u2019\n(Baumgarten had used it as early as 1735), the term became widespread\nonly, though quickly, after his employment of it in the third\nCritique. Yet the employment that became widespread was not exactly\nKant\u2019s, but a narrower one according to which\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 simply functions as an adjective corresponding\nto the noun \u201ctaste.\u201d So for example we find Coleridge, in\n1821, expressing the wish that he \u201ccould find a more familiar\nword than aesthetic for works of taste and criticism,\u201d before\ngoing on to argue:\n\nAs our language \u2026 contains no other useable adjective,\nto express coincidence of form, feeling, and intellect, that\nsomething, which, confirming the inner and the outward senses, becomes\na new sense in itself \u2026 there is reason to hope, that the term\naesthetic, will be brought into common use. (Coleridge 1821,\n254)\n\n\nThe availability of an adjective corresponding to \u201ctaste\u201d\nhas allowed for the retiring of a series of awkward expressions: the\nexpressions \u201cjudgment of taste,\u201d \u201cemotion of\ntaste\u201d and \u201cquality of taste\u201d have given way to the\narguably less offensive \u2018aesthetic judgment,\u2019\n\u2018aesthetic emotion,\u2019 and \u2018aesthetic quality.\u2019\nHowever, as the noun \u2018taste\u2019 phased out, we became saddled\nwith other perhaps equally awkward expressions, including the one that\nnames this entry.\n2. The Concept of the Aesthetic\n\nMuch of the history of more recent thinking about the concept of the\naesthetic can be seen as the history of the development of the\nimmediacy and disinterest theses.\n2.1 Aesthetic Objects\n\nArtistic formalism is the view that the artistically relevant\nproperties of an artwork\u2014the properties in virtue of which it is\nan artwork and in virtue of which it is a good or bad one\u2014are\nformal merely, where formal properties are typically regarded as\nproperties graspable by sight or by hearing merely. Artistic formalism\nhas been taken to follow from both the immediacy and the disinterest\ntheses (Binkley 1970, 266\u2013267; Carroll 2001, 20\u201340). If\nyou take the immediacy thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all\nproperties whose grasping requires the use of reason, and you include\nrepresentational properties in that class, then you are apt to think\nthat the immediacy thesis implies artistic formalism. If you take the\ndisinterest thesis to imply the artistic irrelevance of all properties\ncapable of practical import, and you include representational\nproperties in that class, then you are apt to think that the\ndisinterest thesis implies artistic formalism.\n\nThis is not to suggest that the popularity enjoyed by artistic\nformalism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries owed mainly to\nits inference from the immediacy or disinterest theses. The most\ninfluential advocates of formalism during this period were\nprofessional critics, and their formalism derived, at least in part,\nfrom the artistic developments with which they were concerned. As a\ncritic Eduard Hanslick advocated for the pure music of Mozart,\nBeethoven, Schumann, and later Brahms, and against the dramatically\nimpure music of Wagner; as a theorist he urged that music has no\ncontent but \u201ctonally moving forms\u201d (Hanslick 1986, 29). As\na critic Clive Bell was an early champion of the post-Impressionists,\nespecially Cezanne; as a theorist he maintained that the formal\nproperties of painting\u2014\u201crelations and combinations of\nlines and colours\u201d\u2014alone have artistic relevance (Bell\n1958, 17\u201318). As a critic Clement Greenberg was abstract\nexpressionism\u2019s ablest defender; as a theorist he held\npainting\u2019s \u201cproper area of competence\u201d to be\nexhausted by flatness, pigment, and shape (Greenberg 1986,\n86\u201387).\n\nNot every influential defender of formalism has also been a\nprofessional critic. Monroe Beardsley, who arguably gave formalism its\nmost sophisticated articulation, was not (Beardsley 1958). Nor is Nick\nZangwill, who recently has mounted a spirited and resourceful defense\nof a moderate version of formalism (Zangwill 2001). But formalism has\nalways been sufficiently motivated by art-critical data that once\nArthur Danto made the case that the data no longer supported it, and\nperhaps never really had, formalism\u2019s heyday came to an end.\nInspired in particular by Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes, which\nare (more or less) perceptually indistinguishable from the\nbrand-printed cartons in which boxes of Brillo were delivered to\nsupermarkets, Danto observed that for most any artwork it is possible\nto imagine both (a) another object that is perceptually indiscernible\nfrom it but which is not an artwork, and (b) another artwork that is\nperceptually indiscernible from it but which differs in artistic\nvalue. From these observations he concluded that form alone neither\nmakes an artwork nor gives it whatever value it has (Danto 1981,\n94\u201395; Danto 1986, 30\u201331; Danto 1997, 91).\n\nBut Danto has taken the possibility of such perceptual indiscernibles\nto show the limitations not merely of form but also of aesthetics, and\nhe has done so on the grounds, apparently, that the formal and the\naesthetic are co-extensive. Regarding a urinal Duchamp once exhibited\nand a perceptual indiscernible ordinary urinal, Danto maintains\nthat\n\naesthetics could not explain why one was a work of fine art and the\nother not, since for all practical purposes they were aesthetically\nindiscernible: if one was beautiful, the other one had to be\nbeautiful, since they looked just alike. (Danto 2003, 7)\n\n\nBut the inference from the limits of the artistically formal to the\nlimits of the artistically aesthetic is presumably only as strong as\nthe inferences from the immediacy and disinterest theses to artistic\nformalism, and these are not beyond question. The inference from the\ndisinterest thesis appears to go through only if you employ a stronger\nnotion of disinterest than the one Kant understands himself to be\nemploying: Kant, it is worth recalling, regards poetry as the highest\nof the fine arts precisely because of its capacity to employ\nrepresentational content in the expression of what he calls\n\u2018aesthetic ideas\u2019 (Kant 1790, 191\u2013194; see Costello\n2008 and 2013 for extended treatment of the capacity of Kantian\naesthetics to accommodate conceptual art). The inference from the\nimmediacy thesis appears to go through only if you employ a notion of\nimmediacy stronger than the one Hume, for example, takes himself to be\ndefending when he claims (in a passage quoted in section1.1) that\n\u201cin many orders of beauty, particularly those of the fine arts,\nit is requisite to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the proper\nsentiment\u201d (Hume 1751, 173). It may be that artistic formalism\nresults if you push either of the tendencies embodied in the immediacy\nand disinterest theses to extremes. It may be that the history of\naesthetics from the 18th century to the mid-Twentieth is largely the\nhistory of pushing those two tendencies to extremes. It does not\nfollow that those tendencies must be so pushed.\n\nConsider Warhol\u2019s Brillo Boxes. Danto is right to\nmaintain that the eighteenth-century theorist of taste would not know\nhow to regard it as an artwork. But this is because the\neighteenth-century theorist of taste lives in the 18th century, and so\nwould be unable to situate that work in its twentieth-century\nart-historical context, and not because the kind of theory she holds\nforbids her from situating a work in its art-historical context. When\nHume, for instance, observes that artists address their works to\nparticular, historically-situated audiences, and that a critic\ntherefore \u201cmust place herself in the same situation as the\naudience\u201d to whom a work is addressed (Hume 1757, 239), he is\nallowing that artworks are cultural products, and that the properties\nthat works have as the cultural products they are are among the\n\u201cingredients of the composition\u201d that a critic must grasp\nif she is to feel the proper sentiment. Nor does there seem to be\nanything in the celebrated conceptuality of Brillo Boxes, nor\nof any other conceptual work, that ought to give the\neighteenth-century theorist pause. Francis Hutcheson asserts that\nmathematical and scientific theorems are objects of taste (Hutcheson\n1725, 36\u201341). Alexander Gerard asserts that scientific\ndiscoveries and philosophical theories are objects of taste (Gerard\n1757, 6). Neither argues for his assertion. Both regard it as\ncommonplace that objects of intellect may be objects of taste as\nreadily as objects of sight and hearing may be. Why should the\npresent-day aesthetic theorist think otherwise? If an object is\nconceptual in nature, grasping its nature will require intellectual\nwork. If grasping an object\u2019s conceptual nature requires\nsituating it art-historically, then the intellectual work required to\ngrasp its nature will include situating it art-historically.\nBut\u2014as Hume and Reid held (see section 1.1)\u2014grasping the\nnature of an object preparatory to aesthetically judging it is one\nthing; aesthetically judging the object once grasped is another.\n\nThough Danto has been the most influential and persistent critic of\nformalism, his criticisms are no more decisive than those advanced by\nKendall Walton in his essay \u201cCategories of Art.\u201d\nWalton\u2019s anti-formalist argument hinges on two main theses, one\npsychological and one philosophical. According to the psychological\nthesis, which aesthetic properties we perceive a work as having\ndepends on which category we perceive the work as belonging to.\nPerceived as belonging to the category of painting, Picasso\u2019s\nGuernica will be perceived as \u201cviolent, dynamic, vital,\ndisturbing\u201d (Walton 1970, 347). But perceived as belonging to\nthe category of \u201cguernicas\u201d\u2014where guernicas are\nworks with \u201csurfaces with the colors and shapes of\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica, but the surfaces are molded to\nprotrude from the wall like relief maps of different kinds of\nterrain\u201d\u2014Picasso\u2019s Guernica will be\nperceived not as violent and dynamic, but as \u201ccold, stark,\nlifeless, or serene and restful, or perhaps bland, dull, boring\u201d\n(Walton 1970, 347). That Picasso\u2019s Guernica can be\nperceived both as violent and dynamic and as not violent and not\ndynamic might be thought to imply that there is no fact of the matter\nwhether it is violent and dynamic. But this implication holds only on\nthe assumption that there is no fact of the matter which category\nPicasso\u2019s Guernica actually belongs to, and this\nassumption appears to be false given that Picasso intended that\nGuernica be a painting and did not intend that it be a\nguernica, and that the category of paintings was well-established in\nthe society in which Picasso painted it while the category of\nguernicas was not. Hence the philosophical thesis, according to which\nthe aesthetic properties a work actually has are those it is perceived\nas having when perceived as belonging to the category (or categories)\nit actually belongs to. Since the properties of having been intended\nto be a painting and having been created in a society in which\npainting is well-established category are artistically relevant though\nnot graspable merely by seeing (or hearing) the work, it seems that\nartistic formalism cannot be true. \u201cI do not deny,\u201d Walton\nconcludes, \u201cthat paintings and sonatas are to be judged solely\non what can be seen or heard in them\u2014when they are perceived\ncorrectly. But examining a work with the senses can by itself reveal\nneither how it is correct to perceive it, nor how to perceive it that\nway\u201d (Walton 1970, 367).\n\nBut if we cannot judge which aesthetic properties paintings and\nsonatas have without consulting the intentions and the societies of\nthe artists who created them, what of the aesthetic properties of\nnatural items? With respect to them it may appear as if there is\nnothing to consult except the way they look and sound, so that an\naesthetic formalism about nature must be true. Allen Carlson, a\ncentral figure in the burgeoning field of the aesthetics of nature,\nargues against this appearance. Carlson observes that Walton\u2019s\npsychological thesis readily transfers from works of art to natural\nitems: that we perceive Shetland ponies as cute and charming and\nClydesdales as lumbering surely owes to our perceiving them as\nbelonging to the category of horses (Carlson 1981, 19). He also\nmaintains that the philosophical thesis transfers: whales actually\nhave the aesthetic properties we perceive them as having when we\nperceive them as mammals, and do not actually have any contrasting\naesthetic properties we might perceive them to have when we perceive\nthem as fish. If we ask what determines which category or categories\nnatural items actually belong to, the answer, according to Carlson, is\ntheir natural histories as discovered by natural science (Carlson\n1981, 21\u201322). Inasmuch as a natural item\u2019s natural history\nwill tend not to be graspable by merely seeing or hearing it,\nformalism is no truer of natural items than it is of works of art.\n\nThe claim that Walton\u2019s psychological thesis transfers to\nnatural items has been widely accepted (and was in fact anticipated,\nas Carlson acknowledges, by Ronald Hepburn (Hepburn 1966 and 1968)).\nThe claim that Walton\u2019s philosophical thesis transfers to\nnatural items has proven more controversial. Carlson is surely right\nthat aesthetic judgments about natural items are prone to be mistaken\ninsofar as they result from perceptions of those items as belonging to\ncategories to which they do not belong, and, insofar as determining\nwhich categories natural items actually belong to requires scientific\ninvestigation, this point seems sufficient to undercut the\nplausibility of any very strong formalism about nature (see Carlson\n1979 for independent objections against such formalism). Carlson,\nhowever, also wishes to establish that aesthetic judgments about\nnatural items have whatever objectivity aesthetic judgments about\nworks of art do, and it is controversial whether Walton\u2019s\nphilosophical claim transfers sufficiently to support such a claim.\nOne difficulty, raised by Malcolm Budd (Budd 2002 and 2003) and Robert\nStecker (Stecker1997c), is that since there are many categories in\nwhich a given natural item may correctly be perceived, it is unclear\nwhich correct category is the one in which the item is perceived as\nhaving the aesthetic properties it actually has. Perceived as\nbelonging to the category of Shetland ponies, a large Shetland pony\nmay be perceived as lumbering; perceived as belonging to the category\nof horses, the same pony may be perceived as cute and charming but\ncertainly not lumbering. If the Shetland pony were a work of art, we\nmight appeal to the intentions (or society) of its creator to\ndetermine which correct category is the one that fixes its aesthetic\ncharacter. But as natural items are not human creations they can give\nus no basis for deciding between equally correct but aesthetically\ncontrasting categorizations. It follows, according to Budd, \u201cthe\naesthetic appreciation of nature is endowed with a freedom denied to\nthe appreciation of art\u201d (Budd 2003, 34), though this is perhaps\nmerely another way of saying that the aesthetic appreciation of art is\nendowed with an objectivity denied to the appreciation of nature.\n2.2 Aesthetic Judgment\n\nThe eighteenth-century debate between rationalists and theorists of\ntaste (or sentimentalists) was primarily a debate over the immediacy\nthesis, i.e., over whether we judge objects to be beautiful by\napplying principles of beauty to them. It was not primarily a debate\nover the existence of principles of beauty, a matter over which\ntheorists of taste might disagree. Kant denied that there are any such\nprinciples (Kant 1790, 101), but both Hutcheson and Hume affirmed\ntheir existence: they maintained that although judgments of beauty are\njudgments of taste and not of reason, taste nevertheless operates\naccording to general principles, which might be discovered through\nempirical investigation (Hutcheson 1725, 28\u201335; Hume 1757,\n231\u2013233).\n\nIt is tempting to think of recent debate in aesthetics between\nparticularists and generalists as a revival of the eighteenth-century\ndebate between rationalists and theorists of taste. But the accuracy\nof this thought is difficult to gauge. One reason is that it is often\nunclear whether particularists and generalists take themselves merely\nto be debating the existence of aesthetic principles or to be debating\ntheir employment in aesthetic judgment. Another is that, to the degree\nparticularists and generalists take themselves to be debating the\nemployment of aesthetic principles in aesthetic judgment, it is hard\nto know what they can be meaning by \u2018aesthetic judgment.\u2019\nIf \u2018aesthetic\u2019 still carries its eighteenth-century\nimplication of immediacy, then the question under debate is whether\njudgment that is immediate is immediate. If \u2018aesthetic\u2019 no\nlonger carries that implication, then it is hard to know what question\nis under debate because it is hard to know what aesthetic judgment\ncould be. It may be tempting to think that we can simply re-define\n\u2018aesthetic judgment\u2019 such that it refers to any judgment\nin which an aesthetic property is predicated of an object. But this\nrequires being able to say what an aesthetic property is without\nreference to its being immediately graspable, something no one seems\nto have done. It may seem that we can simply re-define\n\u2018aesthetic judgment\u2019 such that it refers to any judgment\nin which any property of the class exemplified by beauty is predicated\nof an object. But which class is this? The classes exemplified by\nbeauty are presumably endless, and the difficulty is to specify the\nrelevant class without reference to the immediate graspability of its\nmembers, and that is what no one seems to have done.\n\nHowever we are to sort out the particularist/generalist debate,\nimportant contributions to it include, on the side of particularism,\nArnold Isenberg\u2019s \u201cCritical Communication\u201d (1949)\nFrank Sibley\u2019s \u201cAesthetic Concepts\u201d (in Sibley 2001)\nand Mary Mothersill\u2019s Beauty Restored (1984) and, on\nthe side of generalism, Monroe Beardsley\u2019s Aesthetics\n(1958) and \u201cOn the Generality of Critical Reasons\u201d (1962),\nSibley\u2019s \u201cGeneral Reasons and Criteria in\nAesthetics\u201d (in Sibley 2001), George Dickie\u2019s\nEvaluating Art (1987), Stephen Davies\u2019s \u201cReplies\nto Arguments Suggesting that Critics\u2019 Strong Evaluations Could\nnot be Soundly Deduced\u201d (1995), and John Bender\u2019s\n\u201cGeneral but Defeasible Reasons in Aesthetic Evaluation: The\nGeneralist/Particularist Dispute\u201d (1995). Of these, the papers\nby Isenberg and Sibley have arguably enjoyed the greatest\ninfluence.\n\nIsenberg concedes that we often appeal to descriptive features of\nworks in support of our judgments of their value, and he allows that\nthis may make it seem as if we must be appealing to principles in\nmaking those judgments. If in support of a favorable judgment of some\npainting a critic appeals to the wavelike contour formed by the\nfigures clustered in its foreground, it may seem as if his judgment\nmust involve tacit appeal to the principle that any painting having\nsuch a contour is so much the better. But Isenberg argues that this\ncannot be, since no one agrees to any such principle:\n\nThere is not in all the world\u2019s criticism a single purely\ndescriptive statement concerning which one is prepared to say\nbeforehand, \u2018If it is true, I shall like that work so much the\nbetter\u2019 (Isenberg 1949, 338).\n\n\nBut if in appealing to the descriptive features of a work we are not\nacknowledging tacit appeals to principles linking those features to\naesthetic value, what are we doing? Isenberg believes we are offering\n\u201cdirections for perceiving\u201d the work, i.e., by singling\nout certain its features, we are \u201cnarrow[ing] down the field of\npossible visual orientations\u201d and thereby guiding others in\n\u201cthe discrimination of details, the organization of parts, the\ngrouping of discrete objects into patterns\u201d (Isenberg 1949,\n336). In this way we get others to see what we have seen, rather than\ngetting them to infer what we have inferred.\n\nThat Sibley advances a variety of particularism in one paper and a\nvariety of generalism in another will give the appearance of\ninconsistency where there is none: Sibley is a particularist of one\nsort, and with respect to one distinction, and a generalist of another\nsort with respect to another distinction. Isenberg, as noted, is a\nparticularist with respect to the distinction between descriptions and\nverdicts, i.e., he maintains that there are no principles by which we\nmay infer from value-neutral descriptions of works to judgments of\ntheir overall value. Sibley\u2019s particularism and generalism, by\ncontrast, both have to do with judgments falling in between\ndescriptions and verdicts. With respect to a distinction between\ndescriptions and a set of judgments intermediate between descriptions\nand verdicts, Sibley is straightforwardly particularist. With respect\nto a distinction between a set of judgments intermediate between\ndescriptions and verdicts and verdicts, Sibley is a kind of generalist\nand describes himself as such.\n\nSibley\u2019s generalism, as set forth in \u201cGeneral Reasons and\nCriteria in Aesthetics,\u201d begins with the observation that the\nproperties to which we appeal in justification of favorable verdicts\nare not all descriptive or value-neutral. We also appeal to properties\nthat are inherently positive, such as grace, balance, dramatic\nintensity, or comicality. To say that a property is inherently\npositive is not to say that any work having it is so much the better,\nbut rather that its tout court attribution implies value. So\nalthough a work may be made worse on account of its comical elements,\nthe simple claim that a work is good because comical is intelligible\nin a way that the simple claims that a work is good because yellow, or\nbecause it lasts twelve minutes, or because it contains many puns, are\nnot. But if the simple claim that a work is good because comical is\nthus intelligible, comicality is a general criterion for aesthetic\nvalue, and the principle that articulates that generality is true. But\nnone of this casts any doubt on the immediacy thesis, as Sibley\nhimself observes:\n\nI have argued elsewhere that there are no sure-fire rules by which,\nreferring to the neutral and non-aesthetic qualities of things, one\ncan infer that something is balanced, tragic, comic, joyous, and so\non. One has to look and see. Here, equally, at a different level, I am\nsaying that there are no sure-fire mechanical rules or procedures for\ndeciding which qualities are actual defects in the work; one has to\njudge for oneself. (Sibley 2001, 107\u2013108)\n\n\nThe \u201celsewhere\u201d referred to in the first sentence is\nSibley\u2019s earlier paper, \u201cAesthetic Concepts,\u201d which\nargues that the application of concepts such as\n\u2018balanced,\u2019 \u2018tragic,\u2019 \u2018comic,\u2019 or\n\u2018joyous\u2019 is not a matter of determining whether the\ndescriptive (i.e., non-aesthetic) conditions for their application are\nmet, but is rather a matter of taste. Hence aesthetic judgments are\nimmediate in something like the way that judgments of color, or of\nflavor, are:\n\nWe see that a book is red by looking, just as we tell that the tea is\nsweet by tasting it. So too, it might be said, we just see (or fail to\nsee) that things are delicate, balanced, and the like. This kind of\ncomparison between the exercise of taste and the use of the five\nsenses is indeed familiar; our use of the word \u2018taste\u2019\nitself shows that the comparison is age-old and very natural (Sibley\n2001, 13\u201314).\n\n\nBut Sibley recognizes\u2014as his eighteenth-century forebears did\nand his formalist contemporaries did not\u2014that important\ndifferences remain between the exercise of taste and the use of the\nfive senses. Central among these is that we offer reasons, or\nsomething like them, in support of our aesthetic judgments: by\ntalking\u2014in particular, by appealing to the descriptive\nproperties on which the aesthetic properties depend\u2014we justify\naesthetic judgments by bringing others to see what we have seen\n(Sibley 2001, 14\u201319).\n\nIt is unclear to what degree Sibley, beyond seeking to establish that\nthe application of aesthetic concepts is not condition-governed, seeks\nalso to define the term \u2018aesthetic\u2019 in terms of their not\nbeing so. It is clearer, perhaps, that he does not succeed in defining\nthe term this way, whatever his intentions. Aesthetic concepts are not\nalone in being non-condition-governed, as Sibley himself recognizes in\ncomparing them with color concepts. But there is also no reason to\nthink them alone in being non-condition-governed while also being\nreason-supportable, since moral concepts, to give one example, at\nleast arguably also have both these features. Isolating the aesthetic\nrequires something more than immediacy, as Kant saw. It requires\nsomething like the Kantian notion of disinterest, or at least\nsomething to play the role played by that notion in Kant\u2019s\ntheory.\n\nGiven the degree to which Kant and Hume continue to influence thinking\nabout aesthetic judgment (or critical judgment, more broadly), given\nthe degree to which Sibley and Isenberg continue to abet that\ninfluence, it is not surprising that the immediacy thesis is now very\nwidely received. The thesis, however, has come under attack, notably\nby Davies (1990) and Bender (1995). (See also Carroll (2009), who\nfollows closely after Davies (1990), and Dorsch (2013) for further\ndiscussion.)\n\nIsenberg, it will be recalled, maintains that if the critic is arguing\nfor her verdict, her argumentation must go something as follows:\n\nArtworks having p are better for having p.\nW is an artwork having p.\nTherefore, W is so much the better for having\np.\n\n\nSince the critical principle expressed in premise 1 is open to\ncounter-example, no matter what property we substitute for p, Isenberg\nconcludes that we cannot plausibly interpret the critic as arguing for\nher verdict. Rather than defend the principle expressed in premise 1,\nDavies and Bender both posit alternative principles, consistent with\nthe fact that no property is good-making in all artworks, which they\nascribe to the critic. Davies proposes that we interpret the critic as\narguing deductively from principles relativized to artistic type, that\nis, from principles holding that artworks of a specific types or\ncategories\u2014Italian Renaissance paintings, romantic symphonies,\nHollywood Westerns, etc.\u2014having p are better for having it\n(Davies 1990, 174). Bender proposes that we interpret the critic as\narguing inductively from principles expressing mere tendencies that\nhold between certain properties and artworks\u2014principles, in\nother words, holding that artworks having p tend to be better for\nhaving it (Bender 1995, 386).\n\nEach proposal has its own weaknesses and strengths. A problem with\nBender\u2019s approach is that critics do not seem to couch their\nverdicts in probabilistic terms. Were a critic to say that a work is\nlikely to be good, or almost certainly good, or even that she has the\nhighest confidence that it must be good, her language would suggest\nthat she had not herself experienced the work, perhaps that she had\njudged the work on the basis of someone else\u2019s testimony, hence\nthat she is no critic at all. We would therefore have good reason to\nprefer Davies\u2019s deductive approach if only we had good reason\nfor thinking that relativizing critical principles to artistic type\nremoved the original threat of counterexample. Though it is clear that\nsuch relativizing reduces the relative number of counterexamples, we\nneed good reason for thinking that it reduces that number to zero, and\nDavies provides no such reason. Bender\u2019s inductive approach, by\ncontrast, cannot be refuted by counterexample, but only by\ncounter-tendency.\n\nIf the critic argues from the truth of a principle to the truth of a\nverdict\u2014as Davies and Bender both contend\u2014it must be\npossible for her to establish the truth of the principle before\nestablishing the truth of the verdict. How might she do this? It seems\nunlikely that mere reflection on the nature of art, or on the natures\nof types of art, could yield up the relevant lists of good- and\nbad-making properties. At least the literature has yet to produce a\npromising account as to how this might be done. Observation therefore\nseems the most promising answer. To say that the critic establishes\nthe truth of critical principles on the basis of observation, however,\nis to say that she establishes a correlation between certain artworks\nshe has already established to be good and certain properties she has\nalready established those works to have. But then any capacity to\nestablish that works are good by inference from principles evidently\ndepends on some capacity to establish that works are good without any\nsuch inference, and the question arises why the critic should prefer\nto do by inference what she can do perfectly well without. The answer\ncannot be that judging by inference from principle yields\nepistemically better results, since a principle based on observations\ncan be no more epistemically sound than the observations on which it\nis based.\n\nNone of this shows that aesthetic or critical judgment could never be\ninferred from principles. It does however suggest that such judgment\nis first and foremost non-inferential, which is what the immediacy\nthesis holds.\n2.3 The Aesthetic Attitude\n\nThe Kantian notion of disinterest has its most direct recent\ndescendents in the aesthetic-attitude theories that flourished from\nthe early to mid 20th century. Though Kant followed the British in\napplying the term \u2018disinterested\u2019 strictly to pleasures,\nits migration to attitudes is not difficult to explain. For Kant the\npleasure involved in a judgment of taste is disinterested because such\na judgment does not issue in a motive to do anything in particular.\nFor this reason Kant refers to the judgment of taste as contemplative\nrather than practical (Kant 1790, 95). But if the judgment of taste is\nnot practical, then the attitude we bear toward its object is\npresumably also not practical: when we judge an object aesthetically\nwe are unconcerned with whether and how it may further our practical\naims. Hence it is natural to speak of our attitude toward the object\nas disinterested.\n\nTo say, however, that the migration of disinterest from pleasures to\nattitudes is natural is not to say that it is inconsequential.\nConsider the difference between Kant\u2019s aesthetic theory, the\nlast great theory of taste, and Schopenhauer\u2019s aesthetic theory,\nthe first great aesthetic-attitude theory. Whereas for Kant\ndisinterested pleasure is the means by which we discover things to\nbear aesthetic value, for Schopenhauer disinterested attention (or\n\u201cwill-less contemplation\u201d) is itself the locus of\naesthetic value. According to Schopenhauer, we lead our ordinary,\npractical lives in a kind of bondage to our own desires (Schopenhauer\n1819, 196). This bondage is a source not merely of pain but also of\ncognitive distortion in that it restricts our attention to those\naspects of things relevant to the fulfilling or thwarting of our\ndesires. Aesthetic contemplation, being will-less, is therefore both\nepistemically and hedonically valuable, allowing us a desire-free\nglimpse into the essences of things as well as a respite from\ndesire-induced pain:\n\nWhen, however, an external cause or inward disposition suddenly raises\nus out of the endless stream of willing, and snatches knowledge from\nthe thralldom of the will, the attention is now no longer directed to\nthe motives of willing, but comprehends things free from their\nrelation to the will \u2026 Then all at once the peace, always\nsought but always escaping us \u2026 comes to us of its own accord,\nand all is well with us. (Schopenhauer 1819, 196)\n\n\nThe two most influential aesthetic-attitude theories of the 20th\ncentury are those of Edward Bullough and Jerome Stolnitz. According to\nStolnitz\u2019s theory, which is the more straightforward of the two,\nbearing an aesthetic attitude toward an object is a matter of\nattending to it disinterestedly and sympathetically, where to attend\nto it disinterestedly is to attend to it with no purpose beyond that\nof attending to it, and to attend to it sympathetically is to\n\u201caccept it on its own terms,\u201d allowing it, and not\none\u2019s own preconceptions, to guide one\u2019s attention of it\n(Stolnitz 1960, 32\u201336). The result of such attention is a\ncomparatively richer experience of the object, i.e., an experience\ntaking in comparatively many of the object\u2019s features. Whereas a\npractical attitude limits and fragments the object of our experience,\nallowing us to \u201csee only those of its features which are\nrelevant to our purposes,\u2026. By contrast, the aesthetic attitude\n\u2018isolates\u2019 the object and focuses upon it\u2014the\n\u2018look\u2019 of the rocks, the sound of the ocean, the colors in\nthe painting.\u201d (Stolnitz 1960, 33, 35).\n\nBullough, who prefers to speak of \u201cpsychical distance\u201d\nrather than disinterest, characterizes aesthetic appreciation as\nsomething achieved\n\nby putting the phenomenon, so to speak, out of gear with our actual\npractical self; by allowing it to stand outside the context of our\npersonal needs and ends\u2014in short, by looking at it\n\u2018objectively\u2019 \u2026 by permitting only such reactions\non our part as emphasise the \u2018objective features of the\nexperience, and by interpreting even our \u2018subjective\u2019\naffections not as modes of our being but rather as\ncharacteristics of the phenomenon. (Bullough 1995, 298\u2013299;\nemphasis in original).\n\n\nBullough has been criticized for claiming that aesthetic appreciation\nrequires dispassionate detachment:\n\nBullough\u2019s characterization of the aesthetic attitude is the\neasiest to attack. When we cry at a tragedy, jump in fear at a horror\nmovie, or lose ourselves in the plot of a complex novel, we cannot be\nsaid to be detached, although we may be appreciating the aesthetic\nqualities of these works to the fullest\u2026 . And we can\nappreciate the aesthetic properties of the fog or storm while fearing\nthe dangers they present. (Goldman 2005, 264)\n\n\nBut such a criticism seems to overlook a subtlety of Bullough\u2019s\nview. While Bullough does hold that aesthetic appreciation requires\ndistance \u201cbetween our own self and its affections\u201d\n(Bullough 1995, 298), he does not take this to require that we not\nundergo affections but quite the opposite: only if we undergo\naffections have we affections from which to be distanced. So, for\nexample, the properly distanced spectator of a well-constructed\ntragedy is not the \u201cover-distanced\u201d spectator who feels no\npity or fear, nor the \u201cunder-distanced\u201d spectator who\nfeels pity and fear as she would to an actual, present catastrophe,\nbut the spectator who interprets the pity and fear she feels\n\u201cnot as modes of [her] being but rather as characteristics of\nthe phenomenon\u201d (Bullough 1995, 299). The properly distanced\nspectator of a tragedy, we might say, understands her fear and pity to\nbe part of what tragedy is about.\n\nThe notion of the aesthetic attitude has been attacked from all\ncorners and has very few remaining sympathizers. George Dickie is\nwidely regarded as having delivered the decisive blow in his essay\n\u201cThe Myth of the Aesthetic Attitude\u201d (Dickie 1964) by\narguing that all purported examples of interested attention are really\njust examples of inattention. So consider the case of the spectator at\na performance of Othello who becomes increasingly suspicious\nof his own wife as the action proceeds, or the case of the impresario\nwho sits gauging the size of the audience, or the case of the father\nwho sits taking pride in his daughter\u2019s performance, or the case\nof the moralist who sits gauging the moral effects the play is apt to\nproduce in its audience. These and all such cases will be regarded by\nthe attitude theorist as cases of interested attention to the\nperformance, when they are actually nothing but cases of inattention\nto the performance: the jealous husband is attending to his wife, the\nimpresario to the till, the father to his daughter, the moralist to\nthe effects of the play. But if none of them is attending to the\nperformance, then none of them is attending to it interestedly (Dickie\n1964, 57\u201359).\n\nThe attitude theorist, however, can plausibly resist Dickie\u2019s\ninterpretation of such examples. Clearly the impresario is not\nattending to the performance, but there is no reason to regard the\nattitude theorist as committed to thinking otherwise. As for the\nothers, it might be argued that they are all attending. The jealous\nhusband must be attending to the performance, since it is the action\nof the play, as presented by the performance, that is making him\nsuspicious. The proud father must be attending to the performance,\nsince he is attending to his daughter\u2019s performance, which is an\nelement of it. The moralist must be attending to the performance,\nsince he otherwise would have no basis by which to gauge its moral\neffects on the audience. It may be that none of these spectators is\ngiving the performance the attention it demands, but that is precisely\nthe attitude theorist\u2019s point.\n\nBut perhaps another of Dickie\u2019s criticisms, one lesser known,\nultimately poses a greater threat to the ambitions of the attitude\ntheorist. Stolnitz, it will be recalled, distinguishes between\ndisinterested and interested attention according to the purpose\ngoverning the attention: to attend disinterestedly is to attend with\nno purpose beyond that of attending; to attend interestedly is to\nattend with some purpose beyond that of attending. But Dickie objects\nthat a difference in purpose does not imply a difference in\nattention:\n\nSuppose Jones listens to a piece of music for the purpose of being\nable to analyze and describe it on an examination the next day and\nSmith listens to the same music with no such ulterior purpose. There\nis certainly a difference in the motives and intentions of the two\nmen: Jones has an ulterior purpose and Smith does not, but this does\nnot mean Jones\u2019s listening differs from Smith\u2019s\n\u2026 . There is only one way to listen to (to attend to)\nmusic, although there may be a variety of motives, intentions, and\nreasons for doing so and a variety of ways of being distracted from\nthe music. (Dickie 1964, 58).\n\n\nThere is again much here that the attitude theorist can resist. The\nidea that listening is a species of attending can be resisted: the\nquestion at hand, strictly speaking, is not whether Jones and Smith\nlisten to the music in the same way, but whether they\nattend in the same way to the music they are listening to.\nThe contention that Jones and Smith are attending in the same way\nappears to be question-begging, as it evidently depends on a principle\nof individuation that the attitude theorist rejects: if Jones\u2019s\nattention is governed by some ulterior purpose and Smith\u2019s is\nnot, and we individuate attention according to the purpose that\ngoverns it, their attention is not the same. Finally, even if we\nreject the attitude theorist\u2019s principle of individuation, the\nclaim that there is but one way to attend to music is doubtful: one\ncan seemingly attend to music in myriad ways\u2014as historical\ndocument, as cultural artifact, as aural wallpaper, as sonic\ndisturbance\u2014depending on which of the music\u2019s features one\nattends to in listening to it. But Dickie is nevertheless onto\nsomething crucial to the degree he urges that a difference in purpose\nneed not imply a relevant difference in attention.\nDisinterest plausibly figures in the definition of the aesthetic\nattitude only to the degree that it, and it alone, focuses attention\non the features of the object that matter aesthetically. The\npossibility that there are interests that focus attention on just\nthose same features implies that disinterest has no place in such a\ndefinition, which in turn implies that neither it nor the notion of\nthe aesthetic attitude is likely to be of any use in fixing the\nmeaning of the term \u2018aesthetic.\u2019 If to take the aesthetic\nattitude toward an object simply is to attend to its aesthetically\nrelevant properties, whether the attention is interested or\ndisinterested, then determining whether an attitude is aesthetic\napparently requires first determining which properties are the\naesthetically relevant ones. And this task seems always to result\neither in claims about the immediate graspability of aesthetic\nproperties, which are arguably insufficient to the task, or in claims\nabout the essentially formal nature of aesthetic properties, which are\narguably groundless.\n\nBut that the notions of disinterest and psychical distance prove\nunhelpful in fixing the meaning of the term \u2018aesthetic\u2019\ndoes not imply that they are mythic. At times we seem unable to get by\nwithout them. Consider the case of The Fall of\nMiletus\u2014a tragedy written by the Greek dramatist Phrynicus\nand staged in Athens barely two years after the violent Persian\ncapture of the Greek city of Miletus in 494 BC. Herodotus records\nthat\n\n[the Athenians] found many ways to express their sorrow at the fall of\nMiletus, and in particular, when Phrynicus composed and produced a\nplay called The Fall of Miletus, the audience burst into\ntears and fined him a thousand drachmas for reminding them of a\ndisaster that was so close to home; future productions of the play\nwere also banned. (Herodotus, The Histories, 359)\n\n\nHow are we to explain the Athenian reaction to this play without\nrecourse to something like interest or lack of distance? How, in\nparticular, are we to explain the difference between the sorrow\nelicited by a successful tragedy and the sorrow elicited in this case?\nThe distinction between attention and inattention is of no use here.\nThe difference is not that the Athenians could not attend to The\nFall whereas they could attend to other plays. The difference is\nthat they could not attend to The Fall as they could attend\nto other plays, and this because of their too intimate connection to\nwhat attending to The Fall required their attending to.\n2.4 Aesthetic Experience\n\nTheories of aesthetic experience may be divided into two kinds\naccording to the kind of feature appealed to in explanation of what\nmakes experience aesthetic: internalist theories appeal to\nfeatures internal to experience, typically to phenomenological\nfeatures, whereas externalist theories appeal to features\nexternal to the experience, typically to features of the object\nexperienced. (The distinction between internalist and externalist\ntheories of aesthetic experience is similar, though not identical, to\nthe distinction between phenomenal and epistemic conceptions of\naesthetic experience drawn by Gary Iseminger (Iseminger 2003, 100, and\nIseminger 2004, 27, 36)). Though internalist\ntheories\u2014particularly John Dewey\u2019s (1934) and Monroe\nBeardsley\u2019s (1958)\u2014predominated during the early and\nmiddle parts of the 20th century, externalist theories\u2014including\nBeardsley\u2019s (1982) and George Dickie\u2019s (1988)\u2014have\nbeen in the ascendance since. Beardsley\u2019s views on aesthetic\nexperience make a strong claim on our attention, given that Beardsley\nmight be said to have authored the culminating internalist theory as\nwell as the founding externalist one. Dickie\u2019s criticisms of\nBeardsley\u2019s internalism make an equally strong claim, since they\nmoved Beardsley\u2014and with him most everyone else\u2014from\ninternalism toward externalism.\n\nAccording to the version of internalism Beardsley advances in\nhis\u202fAesthetics\u202f(1958), all aesthetic experiences\nhave in common three or four (depending on how you count) features,\nwhich \u201csome writers have [discovered] through acute\nintrospection, and which each of us can test in his own\nexperience\u201d (Beardsley 1958, 527). These are focus (\u201can\naesthetic experience is one in which attention is firmly fixed upon\n[its object]\u201d), intensity, and unity, where unity is a matter of\ncoherence and of completeness (Beardsley 1958, 527). Coherence, in\nturn, is a matter of having elements that are properly connected one\nto another such that\n\n[o]ne thing leads to another; continuity of development, without gaps\nor dead spaces, a sense of overall providential pattern of guidance,\nan orderly cumulation of energy toward a climax, are present to an\nunusual degree. (Beardsley 1958, 528)\n\n\nCompleteness, by contrast, is a matter having elements that\n\u201ccounterbalance\u201d or \u201cresolve\u201d one another such\nthat the whole stands apart from elements without it:\n\nThe impulses and expectations aroused by elements within the\nexperience are felt to be counterbalanced or resolved by other\nelements within the experience, so that some degree of equilibrium or\nfinality is achieved and enjoyed. The experience detaches itself, and\neven insulates itself, from the intrusion of alien elements.\n(Beardsley 1958, 528)\n\n\nDickie\u2019s most consequential criticism of Beardsley\u2019s\ntheory is that Beardsley, in describing the phenomenology of aesthetic\nexperience, has failed to distinguish between the features we\nexperience aesthetic objects as having and the features aesthetic\nexperiences themselves have. So while every feature mentioned in\nBeardsley\u2019s description of the coherence of aesthetic\nexperience\u2014continuity of development, the absence of gaps, the\nmounting of energy toward a climax\u2014surely is a feature we\nexperience aesthetic objects as having, there is no reason to think of\naesthetic experience itself as having any such features:\n\nNote that everything referred to [in Beardsley\u2019s description of\ncoherence] is a perceptual characteristic \u2026 and not an effect\nof perceptual characteristics. Thus, no ground is furnished for\nconcluding that experience can be unified in the sense of being\ncoherent. What is actually argued for is that aesthetic objects are\ncoherent, a conclusion which must be granted, but not the one which is\nrelevant. (Dickie 1965, 131)\n\n\nDickie raises a similar worry about Beardsley\u2019s description of\nthe completeness of aesthetic experience:\n\nOne can speak of elements being counterbalanced\u202fin the\npainting\u202fand say that the painting is stable, balanced and\nso on, but what does it mean to say\nthe\u202fexperience\u202fof the spectator of the painting\nis stable or balanced? \u2026 Looking at a painting in some cases\nmight aid some persons in coming to feel stable because it might\ndistract them from whatever is unsettling them, but such cases are\natypical of aesthetic appreciation and not relevant to aesthetic\ntheory. Aren\u2019t characteristics attributable to the painting\nsimply being mistakenly shifted to the spectator? (Dickie 1965, 132)\n\n\nThough these objections turned out to be only the beginning of the\ndebate between Dickie and Beardsley on the nature of aesthetic\nexperience (See Beardsley 1969, Dickie 1974, Beardsley 1970, and\nDickie 1987; see also Iseminger 2003 for a helpful overview of the\nBeardsley-Dickie debate), they nevertheless went a long way toward\nshaping that debate, which taken as whole might be seen as the working\nout of an answer to the question \u201cWhat can a theory of aesthetic\nexperience be that takes seriously the distinction between the\nexperience of features and the features of experience?\u201d The\nanswer turned out to be an externalist theory of the sort that\nBeardsley advances in the 1970 essay \u201cThe Aesthetic Point of\nView\u201d and that many others have advanced since: a theory\naccording to which an aesthetic experience just is an experience\nhaving aesthetic content, i.e., an experience of an object as having\nthe aesthetic features that it has.\n\nThe shift from internalism to externalism has meant that one central\nambition of internalism\u2014that of tying the meaning of\n\u2018aesthetic\u2019 to features internal to aesthetic\nexperience\u2014has had to be given up. But a second, equally\ncentral, ambition\u2014that of accounting for aesthetic value by\ngrounding it in the value of aesthetic experience\u2014has been\nretained. The following section takes up the development and prospects\nof such accounts.\n 2.5 Aesthetic Value\n\nTo count as complete a theory of aesthetic value must answer\ntwo questions:\n\nWhat makes aesthetic value\naesthetic?\nWhat makes aesthetic value\nvalue?\n\n\nThe literature refers to the first question sometimes as the\naesthetic question (Lopes 2018, 41\u201343; Shelley 2019, 1) and\nsometimes as the demarcation question (van der Berg 2020, 2;\nMatherne 2020, 315; Peacocke 2021, 165). It refers to the second as\nthe normative question (Lopes 2018, 41\u201343; Shelley\n2019, 1; Matherne 2020, 315).\n2.5.1 The Aesthetic Question\n\nThe prevailing answer to the aesthetic question is aesthetic\nformalism, the view that aesthetic value is aesthetic because\nobjects bear it in virtue of their perceptual properties, where these\nencompass visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, and tactile\nproperties. Aesthetic formalism rose to prominence when and because\nartistic formalism did, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries\n(see Section 5.1). Because everyone then took artistic value to be a\nspecies of aesthetic value, artistic formalism could gain prominence\nonly by dragging aesthetic formalism in its train. But whereas\nartistic formalism has since fallen from favor, aesthetic formalism\nhas held its ground. The explanation, arguably, has to do with the way\naesthetic formalism honors the conceptual link between the aesthetic\nand the perceptual. Any adequate answer to the aesthetic question must\nmeet what we may call the perceptual constraint, that is, it\nmust plausibly articulate the sense in which aesthetic value is\nperceptual. Aesthetic formalism does this in the clearest possible\nterms.\n\nVersions of aesthetic formalism come in varying strengths. Its\nstrongest versions hold objects to have aesthetic value strictly in\nvirtue of their perceptual properties (Bell 1958/1914; Danto 2003,\n92). Weaker versions either allow objects to have aesthetic value in\nvirtue of their non-perceptual content so long as that content\nexpresses itself perpetually (Zangwill 1998, 71\u201372) or require merely\nthat objects paradigmatically have aesthetic value in virtue of their\nperceptual properties (Levinson 1996, 6). All versions of aesthetic\nformalism struggle, one way or another, to accommodate our\nlong-standing practice of ascribing aesthetic value to objects that do\nnot address themselves primarily to the five bodily senses. Consider\nworks of literature. We have been ascribing aesthetic value to them\nfor as long as we have been ascribing aesthetic value to artworks of\nany kind. How might the aesthetic theorist square her theory with this\npractice? A first approach is simply to dismiss that practice,\nregarding its participants as linguistically confused, as applying\nterms of aesthetic praise to objects constitutionally incapable of\nmeriting it (Danto 2003, 92). But given how extremely revisionist this\napproach is, we ought to wait on an argument of proportionately\nextreme strength before adopting it. A second approach allows that\nliterary works bear aesthetic value, but only in virtue of their\nsensory properties, such as properties associated with assonance,\nconsonance, rhythm, and imagery (Urmson 1957, 85\u201386, 88;\nZangwill 2001, 135\u2013140). But this approach accounts for a mere\nfraction of the aesthetic value we routinely ascribe to works of\nliterature. Suppose you praise a short story for the eloquence of its\nprose and the beauty of its plot-structure. It seems arbitrary to\ncount only the eloquence as a genuine instance of aesthetic value. A\nthird approach treats literary works as exceptional, allowing them,\nalone among works of art, to bear aesthetic value in virtue of their\nnon-perceptual properties (Binkley 1970, 269;\nLevinson 1996, 6 n.9). The difficulty here\nis to explain literature\u2019s exceptionality. If literary works\nsomehow bear aesthetic value in virtue of non-perceptual properties,\nwhat prevents non-literary works from doing the same? Moreover, to\nwhatever degree we allow things to have aesthetic value in virtue of\ntheir non-perceptual properties, to that degree we sever the\nconnection the formalist asserts between the aesthetic and the\nperceptual and so undermine our reason for adopting aesthetic\nformalism in the first place.\n\nWe might be forced to choose from among these three formalist\napproaches to literature if aesthetic formalism constituted the only\nplausible articulation of the sense in which aesthetic value is\nperceptual, but it doesn\u2019t. Instead of holding that aesthetic\nvalue is perceptual because things have it in virtue of their\nperpetual properties, one might hold that aesthetic value is\nperceptual because we perceive things as having it. This would be a\ncorollary of the immediacy thesis as defined in Section 1.1. If, as\nthat thesis holds, aesthetic judgment is perceptual, having all the\nimmediacy of any standard perceptual judgment, then aesthetic\nproperties are perceptual, grasped with all the immediacy of standard\nperceptual properties. That aesthetic properties are thus perceptual\nis Sibley\u2019s point in the following:\n\nIt is of importance to note first that, broadly speaking, aesthetics\ndeals with a kind of perception. People have to see the grace\nor unity of a work, hear the plaintiveness or frenzy in the\nmusic, notice the gaudiness of a colour scheme, feel\nthe power of a novel, its mood, or its uncertainty of tone. (Sibley\n2001, 34, emphasis in original)\n\n\nSibley says that people have to see the grace or unity of a work and\nthey have to feel the power of a novel. He doesn\u2019t say that they\nhave to see the properties in virtue of which a work has grace or\nunity or feel the properties in virtue of which a novel has power: the\nproperties in virtue of which a work has grace or unity need not be\nperceptual and the properties in virtue of which a novel has power\npresumably will not be. Thus the literature problem, over which\nformalism stumbles, does not arise for Sibley, nor for anyone else\ncommitted to the immediacy thesis, including\nShaftesbury (Cooper 1711, 17, 231), Hutcheson (1725,\n16\u201324), Hume (1751, Section I), and Reid (1785, 760\u2013761),\namong others. For the immediacy theorist, the aesthetic value we\nascribe to literary works is aesthetic because we perceive literary\nworks as bearing it.\n2.5.2 The Normative Question\n\nThe prevailing answer to the normative question is aesthetic\nhedonism, the view that aesthetic value is value because things\nhaving it give pleasure when experienced. Aesthetic hedonism achieved\nprominence in the 19th century, roughly when aesthetic formalism did.\nSchopenhauer played a pivotal role in bringing it to prominence by\nreassigning disinterested pleasure from the role it had been playing\nin aesthetic judgment to the role of grounding aesthetic value\n(Schopenhauer 1818 [1969], 195\u2013200). Bentham (1789, ch. 4) and\nMill (1863 [2001]; ch. 2) arguably played larger roles by popularizing\nvalue hedonism, that is, the view that pleasure is the ground of all\nvalue. But whereas value hedonism no longer holds much sway in ethics,\nand Schopenhauer no longer exerts much influence in aesthetics,\naesthetic hedonism has held its ground. The explanation presumably has\nto do with the apparent ease with which aesthetic hedonism explains\nwhy we seek out objects of aesthetic value. Any adequate answer to the\nnormative question must meet what we may call the normative\nconstraint, that is, it must plausibly identify what a\nthing\u2019s having aesthetic value gives us reason to do. Aesthetic\nhedonism, locating that reason in the pleasure taken in experiencing\naesthetically valuable objects, does this in the clearest possible\nterms.\n\nAdvocates of aesthetic hedonism include Schopenhauer 1818 [1969], Clive\nBell 1914 [1958], C. I. Lewis 1946, Monroe Beardsley 1982, George Dickie\n1988, Alan Goldman 1990, Kendall Walton 1993, Malcolm Budd 1995,\nJerrold Levinson 1996, 2002, Gary Iseminger 2004, Robert Stecker 2006,\n2019, Nick Stang 2010 and Mohan Matthen 2017. It is only quite\nrecently that any sustained opposition to hedonism has arisen, a fact\nthat may go some way toward explaining why hedonists, as a rule, see\nno need to argue for their view, opting instead to develop it in light\nof objections an imagined opposition might make.\n\nBeardsley, for instance, leads with this simple formulation of\nhedonism:\n\nThe aesthetic value of an object is the value it possesses in virtue\nof its capacity to provide aesthetic gratification. (Beardsley 1982,\n21).\n\n\nBut he then anticipates a fatal objection. Sometimes we undervalue\naesthetic objects, finding them to have less value than they actually\nhave; other times we overvalue aesthetic objects, finding them to have\ngreater value than they actually have. The simple formulation above is\nconsistent with undervaluation, since it is possible to take less\naesthetic pleasure from an object than it has the capacity to provide,\nbut inconsistent with overvaluation, since it is impossible to take\ngreater aesthetic pleasure from an object than it has the capacity to\nprovide (Beardsley 1982, 26\u201327). To remedy this problem,\nBeardsley appends a rider:\n\nThe aesthetic value of [an object] is the value [it] possesses in\nvirtue of its capacity to provide aesthetic gratification when\ncorrectly and completely experienced (Beardsley 1982, 27, italics\nin original).\n\n\nSuppose we refer to the italicized portion of this formulation as\nthe epistemic qualification and the non-italicized portion as\nthe hedonic thesis. The epistemic qualification renders the\nhedonic thesis consistent with overvaluation, given that you can\nmisapprehend an object such that you take greater aesthetic pleasure\nfrom it than it has the capacity to provide when apprehended correctly\nand completely.\n\nBeardsley\u2019s version of aesthetic hedonism has served as a model\nfor subsequent versions (Levinson 2002, n. 23); at least all\nsubsequent versions consist of an epistemically qualified hedonic\nthesis in some form. Beardsley\u2019s version, however, seems open to\ncounter-example. Consider Tony Morrison\u2019s Beloved, for\ninstance, or Cormac McCarthy\u2019s Blood Meridian. Taking\npleasure from works designed to cause shock, horror, despair, or moral\nrevulsion may seem perverse; surely, it may seem, such works do not\nhave whatever aesthetic value they have in virtue of any pleasure they\ngive. One way to accommodate such cases is to cast aesthetic pleasure\nas a higher-order response, that is, a response that depends on\nlower-order responses, which in some cases might include shock,\nhorror, despair, and moral revulsion (Walton 1993, 508; Levinson 1992,\n18). Another way is to broaden the field of experiences that may\nground aesthetic value. Though pleasure as a rule grounds aesthetic\nvalue, in exceptional cases certain non-hedonic yet intrinsically\nvaluable experiences\u2014which may include horror, shock, despair,\nand revulsion\u2014may also do so (Levinson 1992, 12; Stecker 2005,\n12). The literature refers to this latter, broadened variety of\nhedonism as aesthetic empiricism; it hasn\u2019t settled on\na name for the former variety, but we may call it tiered\nhedonism, given the varying levels of response it takes aesthetic\nexperience to comprise.\n\nYet another objection, anticipated by hedonists, holds hedonism to\nimply the heresy of the separable experience (Budd 1985,\n125). It is a commonplace that for any object bearing aesthetic value\nnothing other than it can have just the particular value it has,\nexcepting the improbable case in which something other than it has\njust its particular aesthetic character. The worry is that hedonism,\ngiven that it regards aesthetic value as instrumental to the value of\nexperience, implies that for any object bearing aesthetic value\nsomething wholly other from it, such as a drug, might induce the same\nexperience and so serve up the same value. The hedonist\u2019s usual\nreply is to assert that aesthetic experience is inseparable from its\nobject, such that for any aesthetic experience, that experience is\njust the particular experience it is because it has just the\nparticular aesthetic object it has (Levinson 1996, 22\u201323; Budd\n1985, 123\u2013124; S. Davies 1994: 315\u201316; Stang 2012,\n271\u2013272).\n\nActual opposition to hedonism did not materialize until the present\ncentury (Sharpe 2000, Davies 2004), and most all of that during the\npast decade or so (Shelley 2010, 2011, 2019; Wolf 2011; Lopes 2015,\n2018; Gorodeisky 2021a, 2021b). Why the opposition took so long to\nshow up is a good question. It is tempting to think its answer resides\nin the obvious truth of the hedonist\u2019s central premise, namely,\nthat aesthetically valuable objects please us, at least in general.\nAnti-hedonists, however, have taken no interest in denying this\npremise. One useful way to think of the dialectic between hedonists\nand their opponents is to regard each as grasping one horn of an\naesthetic version of the Euthyphro dilemma, where hedonists hold\nthings to have aesthetic value because they please and anti-hedonists\nhold things to please because they have aesthetic value (Augustine\n2005/389\u2013391, De vera religione \u00a759; Gorodeisky\n2012a, 201 and 2021b, 262). Seen this way, the fact that aesthetically\nvaluable things please tells not at all in favor of the hedonist;\nindeed, it is precisely this fact that the anti-hedonist thinks the\nhedonist cannot explain.\n\nFor instance, Wolf, in the context of an extended, nuanced case\nagainst value welfarism, argues that aesthetic hedonism cannot account\nfor the fact that Middlemarch is a better novel than the\nDa Vinci Code,given that most people apparently like the latter\nbetter, presumably because it gives them greater pleasure (Wolf 2011,\n54\u201355; see also Sharpe 2000, 326). The hedonist has a ready\nreply in the claim that all standard versions of hedonism are now\nepistemically qualified, that while most people may derive greater\npleasure from the Da Vinci Code, a fully informed\nreader\u2014that is, a reader who gives both texts a correct and\ncomplete reading\u2014will not, assuming Middlemarch to be\nthe better novel. But it\u2019s not clear how much appeal to the\nepistemic qualification ultimately helps the hedonist. The\nanti-hedonist will want to know what best explains the fact that a\nfully informed reader will derive greater pleasure from\nMiddlemarch (Wolf 2011, 55; D. Davies 2004, 258\u2013259;\nSharpe 2000, 325). Suppose we say that it owes to the fully informed\nreader\u2019s grasping the superiority of\nMiddlemarch\u2019s structure, the higher quality of its\nprose, the greater subtlety and depth of its character development,\nand the greater penetration of the insights it affords (Wolf 2011,\n55). Wouldn\u2019t we then be saying that it owes to her grasping the\ngreater aesthetic value of Middlemarch? Wouldn\u2019t that\nbe part of what a fully informed reader is fully informed about?\n\nOf course, the hedonist may allow Middlemarch to be\naesthetically better because of its superior structure, prose,\ncharacter development, and insight; to allow this, from her point of\nview, is simply to allow that these are the elements in virtue of\nwhich a fully informed reader will derive greater pleasure. But here\nit would be good if the hedonist had an argument. Otherwise, the\nanti-hedonist will rightly wonder how it is that a correct and\ncomplete experience of Middlemarch will be an experience of\nevery value-conferring feature of Middlemarch yet not an\nexperience of the value conferred by those features. She will rightly\nwonder whether the hedonist fails to honor her own commitment to\nexternalism about aesthetic value; she will rightly wonder, in other\nwords, whether the hedonist fails to distinguish between a valuable\nexperience and an experience of value, just as the internalist about\naesthetic value fails to distinguish between a coherent and complete\nexperience and an experience of coherence and completeness.\n\nEarlier we attributed the appeal of hedonism to the apparent ease with\nwhich it explains our seeking out objects of aesthetic value.\nAnti-hedonists take that ease to be apparent merely. Some\nanti-hedonists, for instance, argue that at least some aesthetically\nvaluable objects offer up pleasure only on condition that we do not\nseek it (Lopes 2018, 84\u201386; Ven der Berg 2020, 5\u20136; see\nalso Elster 1983, 77\u201385). Lopes puts the point this way:\n\nSometimes an agent has an aesthetic reason to act and yet they could\nnot be motivated to act out of a hedonic desire that would be\nsatisfied by their so acting. To get any pleasure, they must act out\nof non-hedonic motives. Strolling through the Louvre, they happen upon\nthe Chardins, and they look at them. So long as they do not look\nseeking pleasure, they get the pleasure that the paintings afford\n(Lopes 2018, 85\u201386).\n\n\nLopes\u2019s choice of example is not arbitrary. There are particular\nart-critical reasons for thinking that Chardins will frustrate the\nhedonically motivated viewer (Fried 1980, 92; cited in Lopes 2018,\n85), and Lopes is careful to claim that only \u201csome aesthetic\npleasures are essential by-products of acts motivated by other\nconsiderations\u201d (Lopes 2018, 85). But it\u2019s not as if\nLopes\u2019s claim is specific to Chardins. Consider again\nWolf\u2019s assertation that most readers take greater pleasure from\nThe Da Vinci Code than from Middlemarch. If that\nassertion is correct, as it plausibly is, perhaps this is because (a)\nmost readers read for pleasure, and (b) The Da Vinci Code\naffords pleasure to readers who read for it, whereas (c)\nMiddlemarch withholds pleasure from such readers, affording\npleasure instead on readers who read in pursuit of some non-hedonic\ngood.\n\nThere is an apparent tension, moreover, between the hedonist\u2019s\nreliance on the epistemic qualification and her claim that pleasure\nrationalizes our aesthetic pursuits. Consider the\nless-than-fully-informed reader who overvalues The Da Vinci\nCode and undervalues Middlemarch. The epistemic\nqualification is designed to allow the hedonist to explain how this\nmight occur: such a reader takes greater pleasure from The Da\nVinci Code, and less (or lesser) pleasure from\nMiddlemarch, than she would were she fully informed. The\nepistemic qualification, moreover, allows the hedonist to explain why\nthe uninformed reader has aesthetic reason not to undervalue\nMiddlemarch: she is missing out on pleasure that would be\nhers if only she gave Middlemarch a fully informed reading.\nBut the hedonist struggles to explain why the uninformed reader has\nreason not to overvalue the Da Vinci Code. If The Da\nVinci Code gives the reader greater pleasure when she overvalues\nit, not only has she no aesthetic reason to be fully informed, she has\naesthetic reason not to be. It therefore seems that if pleasure\nrationalized our hedonic pursuits, we would take ourselves to have\nreason to experience aesthetic objects in whatever way maximizes our\npleasure. To the degree that we instead take ourselves to have reason\nto experience aesthetic objects completely and correctly\u2014to the\ndegree that we instead take ourselves to have reason to experience\naesthetic objects as having the aesthetic values they in fact\nhave\u2014suggests that pleasure is not the aesthetic good\nwe\u2019re after (Shelley 2011).\n\nBut if pleasure is not the aesthetic good we\u2019re after, what is?\nPart of hedonism\u2019s perceived inevitability over the past century\nor so has owed to our inability even to imagine alternatives to it. If\nopposition to hedonism has been slow to materialize, alternatives have\nbeen slower still. To date, the only fully realized alternative to\nhedonism is Lopes\u2019s network theory of aesthetic normativity,\narticulated and defended in his ground-breaking Being for Beauty:\nAesthetic Agency and Value (2018).\n\nEarlier we noted how Lopes challenges the hedonist on her own terms,\nobjecting that she cannot adequately explain why we seek out objects\nof aesthetic value, given that aesthetic pleasure is at least\nsometimes an essential by-product of our seeking after something else\n(2018, 84\u201386). Lopes\u2019s deeper challenge, however, targets\nthe hedonist\u2019s very terms. Aesthetic considerations rationalize\na very great variety of aesthetic acts, according to Lopes:\nappreciating objects of aesthetic value is one such act, but so too is\nhanging a poster one way rather than another, selecting this book\nrather than that one for a book club, building out a garden this way\nrather than that, conserving one video game rather than another,\npairing this dish with this wine rather than that one, and so on\nad infinitum (2018, 32\u201336). If a theory of aesthetic\nvalue is to accommodate such a vast range of aesthetic acts, without\nsingling out any one as more central than the others, it will have to\nconceive of aesthetic normativity as a species of some very general\nkind of normativity. Lopes, accordingly, conceives of aesthetic\nnormativity as a species of the most generic form of practical\nnormativity; that aesthetic acts ought to be performed well follows\nfrom the premise that all acts ought to be performed well for the\nsimple reason that they are acts (2018, 135\u2013137). As Lopes puts\nit: \u201cAesthetic values inherit their practical normativity from a\nbasic condition of all agency\u2014agents must use what they have to\nperform successfully\u201d (2018, 135). Just which competencies an\naesthetic agent may call upon to perform successfully on any given\noccasion depends on the particular role they happen to be playing in\nthe particular social practice in which they happen to be performing\n(2018, 135). It is from the fact that all aesthetic activity\nnecessarily takes place within the domain of some particular social\npractice that the network theory of aesthetic value takes its name\n(2018, 119).\n\nIn holding aesthetic agents to be performing the greatest variety of\naesthetic acts on the greatest variety of items in coordination with\none another, the network theory departs radically from hedonism. But,\nas Lopes himself observes, the network theory follows after hedonism\nin one fundamental way: inasmuch as both theories \u201canswer the\nnormative question but offer nothing in answer to the aesthetic\nquestion,\u201d both \u201care consistent with any stand-alone\nanswer to the aesthetic question\u201d (2018, 48). The claim that the\nnormative and aesthetic questions admit of stand-alone answers implies\nthat aesthetic value is a species of the genus value\nin a standard species-genus relation, such that what makes aesthetic\nvalue value has no bearing on what makes it aesthetic and vice-versa.\nIt therefore also implies that aesthetic value is not a\ndeterminate of the determinable value, such that what makes\naesthetic value aesthetic is very thing that makes it value.\n\nDo answers to the normative and aesthetic questions stand alone or\nstand together? If we have not yet registered the urgency of this\nquestion, perhaps that is because no one has yet fully articulated,\nlet alone defended, a theory of aesthetic value according to which\naesthetic value is a determinate form of value. Such a theory appears\nto be implicit, however, in Shelley 2011, Watkins and Shelley 2012,\nGorodeisky and Marcus 2018, Gorodeisky 2021a, and Shelley 2022. The\nposition common to these authors has been dubbed the Auburn\nview (Van der Berg 2020, 11). It answers the aesthetic question,\nand therein the value question, by holding an item\u2019s having\naesthetic value to rationalize its appreciation in a distinctively\nself-reflexive way, such that part of what you perceive when you\nappreciate an aesthetically valuable item is that it ought to be\nappreciated as you appreciating it (Shelley 2011, 220\u2013222;\nWatkins and Shelley 2012, 348\u2013350; Gorodeisky and Marcus 2018,\n117\u2013119; Gorodeisky 2021a, 200, 207; Shelley 2022, 12). The\nnetwork theorist may object that the Auburn view privileges acts of\nappreciation as surely as hedonism does, but such an objection, from\nthe Auburn perspective, begs the question. It is in assuming that the\nnormative and aesthetic questions admit of stand-alone answers that\nthe network theorist grants herself the freedom of passing on the\naesthetic question, and it is in passing on the aesthetic question\nthat she grants herself the freedom of treating each of a very great\nvariety of aesthetic acts as equally central. It is in assuming that\naesthetic value is a determinate of the determinable\nvalue, meanwhile, that the Auburnite places herself under the\nnecessity of answering the aesthetic question, and it is in seeking an\nanswer to the aesthetic question that she places herself under the\nnecessity of singling out appreciation as aesthetically central. The\nnetwork theorist and the Auburnite agree that the aesthetic question\ndeserves an answer sooner or later (Lopes 2018, 46). They disagree,\ncrucially, about whether it deserves an answer sooner rather than\nlater.\n\nThe network theory and the Auburn view hardly exhaust the options for\nnon-hedonic theories of aesthetic normativity: Nguyen 2019, Matherne\n2020, Peacocke 2021, Kubala 2021, and Riggle 2022 all represent\npromising new directions. Yet every new theory of aesthetic value,\nhedonic or not, must follow after the network theory or the Auburn\nview in regarding answers to the normative and aesthetic questions as\nstand-alone or stand-together. A lot hangs on the decision to follow\none path rather than the other. Perhaps it\u2019s time we attend to\nit.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": [], "cat_ref_text": {"ref_list": ["Augustine, 389\u2013390/2005 <em>De vera religione</em> in\n<em>Works of Saint Augustine.
