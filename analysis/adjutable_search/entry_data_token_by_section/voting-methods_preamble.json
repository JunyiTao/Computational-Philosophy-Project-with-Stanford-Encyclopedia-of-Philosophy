    "main_text": "\n\nA fundamental problem faced by any group of people is how to arrive at\na good group decision when there is disagreement among its members.\nThe difficulties are most evident when there is a large number of\npeople with diverse opinions, such as, when electing leaders in a\nnational election. But it is often not any easier with smaller groups,\nsuch as, when a committee must select a candidate to hire, or when a\ngroup of friends must decide where to go for dinner. Mathematicians,\nphilosophers, political scientists and economists have devised various\nvoting methods that select a winner (or winners) from a set of\nalternatives taking into account everyone\u2019s opinion. It is not hard to\nfind examples in which different voting methods select different\nwinners given the same inputs from the members of the group. What\ncriteria should be used to compare and contrast different voting\nmethods? Not only is this an interesting and difficult theoretical\nquestion, but it also has important practical ramifications. Given the\ntumultuous 2016 election cycle, many people (both researchers and\npoliticians) have suggested that the US should use a different voting\nmethod. However, there is little agreement about which voting method\nshould be used. \n\nThis article introduces and critically examines a number of different\nvoting methods. Deep and important results in the theory of social\nchoice suggest that there is no single voting method that is best in\nall situations (see List 2013 for an overview). My objective in this\narticle is to highlight and discuss the key results and issues that\nfacilitate comparisons between voting methods. \n",
