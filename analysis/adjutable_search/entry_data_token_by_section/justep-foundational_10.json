Objections to Internalist Alternatives to Classical Foundationalism\n\nIn this section, we focus on objections commonly raised against\nphenomenal conservatism and dogmatism, though they arguably apply to\nother internalist foundationalist views as well.\n\nAs one might expect, the main worry with both Huemer\u2019s\nphenomenal conservatism and Pryor\u2019s dogmatism is the very air of\ndogmatism that Pryor embraces in his label for the view. It strikes\nmany epistemologists that these views make getting justification for\none\u2019s beliefs too easy. Perhaps sensations are representational\nstates, and perhaps there is the kind of representational state that\nHuemer and other phenomenal conservatives call an appearance or a\nseeming, but as why should we assume that they accurately represent\nthe world around us? Fear is a representational or propositional\nstate, but from the fact that I fear that there are ghosts, it hardly\nseems to follow that I have a prima facie justification for\nbelieving that there are ghosts. For that matter, belief is a\nrepresentational state and if we doubt that mere belief can provide\njustification, why should we think another representational state,\nlike a seeming, provides justification? Huemer and Pryor will answer\nthat the representational states they offer as justifiers, perhaps\nbecause of their peculiar \u201cphenomenal force\u201d or\n\u201cassertiveness\u201d, are simply different in this respect.\nWhile providing no guarantee that the world is as represented, they\nsimply carry with them justification that other representational\nstates are incapable of providing.\n\nThe claim that phenomenal conservatism and dogmatism make getting\njustification too easy can be motivated by the \u201cproblem of easy\nknowledge\u201d. Since this problem has been raised against both\ninternalist and externalist alternatives to classical foundationalism,\nwe present this problem in\n section 8,\n after discussing externalism.\n",
