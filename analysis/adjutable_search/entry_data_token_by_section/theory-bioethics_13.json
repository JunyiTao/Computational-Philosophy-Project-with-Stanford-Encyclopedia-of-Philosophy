    "main_text": "The Move to Mid-Level Theorizing: a Principles-Centered Approach || The Common Morality\n4.2 The Common Morality\n\nSince the third edition of PBE, the source of the four principles has\nbeen not high theory but the common morality. For Beauchamp and\nChildress, the common morality is what they take to be a universal\nmorality, one to which all morally serious persons are committed\n(Beauchamp & Childress 2019b). The content of the common morality\nis dictated by the primary objectives of morality, which include, for\nexample, the amelioration of human misery. It encompasses certain\nrules of obligation (tell the truth, keep promises), and endorses\ncertain standards of moral character, such as honesty and integrity\n(Arras 2017: 21\u20133).\n\nImportantly, this common morality is historicist, in that its\nauthority is established historically, through the success of its\nrelated norms in advancing human flourishing across time and place.\nHowever, unlike many historicist accounts, the common morality is not\nrelativist, as its norms are to be applied universally. Beauchamp and\nChildress accord the common morality a special place within their\napproach, a place shielded from the jostling involved in the quest for\ncoherence through wide reflective equilibrium. The common morality is\nthus the foundationalist aspect of their account. Moral conclusions,\nthen, are justified through both coherence (via the method of\nreflective equilibrium), and through foundationalism, being connected\nto the principles of the common morality (Arras 2017: 23; Beauchamp\n& Childress 2019b: 11).\n",
