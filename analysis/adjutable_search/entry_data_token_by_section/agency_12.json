    "main_text": "Empirical challenges and the role of consciousness || Reasons and causes\n4.1 Reasons and causes\nAccording to our commonsense conception of agency, our reasons and\nconscious intentions tend to make a real difference to how we act\n(D\u2019Andrade 1987; Malle 2004, for instance). This assumption is\npart and parcel of the standard theory and of numerous psychological\ntheories of intentional action and motivation (Fishbein and Ajzen\n1975; Locke and Latham 1990; Heckhausen 1991; Gollwitzer 1993; Austin\nand Vancouver 1996, for instance). There are, however, various\nempirical findings from psychology and cognitive neuroscience that\nhave been taken to show that this commonsense assumption is\nunwarranted, and that have raised interesting and challenging\nquestions concerning the role of consciousness in the initiation and\nguidance of agency. This section provides an overview of the most\nrelevant research.\nAn early and highly influential source of the skepticism concerning\nthe causal relevance of our reasons is a theoretical review by Nisbett\nand Wilson (1977). This article reports numerous experiments and\nstudies in which participants appear to construct or confabulate\nrationalizing explanations by giving reasons that could not possibly\nhave been the reasons they acted for. Despite some rather serious\nmethodological problems (White 1988), this research has achieved and\nretained the status of textbook knowledge within psychology and\ncognitive science. Moreover, it has been taken to show that ordinary\nreason explanations are not causal explanations, even though the\nauthors themselves rejected this conclusion. On their view, the\nevidence shows, first and foremost, that verbal reports of mental\nstates are based on self-interpretation (theorizing or\nrationalization), rather than on direct or introspective access. They\nnoted that this epistemic view is perfectly compatible with the\nassumption that we can and often do give the actual causes of our\nactions when we give an ordinary reason explanation. The upshot is\nthat, even if the proposed epistemic view is correct, there is nothing\nin the evidence which shows that reason explanations cannot be causal\nexplanations, and there is nothing in the evidence which shows that\nreason explanations are usually not causal explanations.\n",
