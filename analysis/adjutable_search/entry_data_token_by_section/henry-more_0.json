    "main_text": "Early Life and Writings\n1. Early Life and Writings\n\nBorn in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 12 October 1614, More was the\nseventh son of Alexander More, sometime alderman and mayor of\nGrantham, and his wife, Anne (n\u00e9e Lacy). After initial\nschooling at Grantham grammar school, he was sent to Eton College in\n1628. In 1631, his uncle, Gabriel More, who was a fellow at\nChrist\u2019s College, Cambridge, arranged for Henry to enter his\ncollege. This was to be the setting for the rest of More\u2019s life.\nHe took a BA in 1636, the MA in 1639, and was made a fellow of the\ncollege in 1641. More had already begun to familiarise himself with\nNeoplatonic philosophy during his undergraduate years, and began to\ndevelop his own dualistic ideas, emphasising the immateriality of the\nsoul, in philosophical poems approximating to the mode of Edmund\nSpenser\u2019s Faerie Queen (1590), which he wrote in 1639\nand 1640. He ventured into print with the first of these, the\nPsychodia Platonica (\u201cPlatonic Song of the Soul\u201d)\nin 1642 (Crocker 2003).\n\nIt seems clear that from very early on More developed ambitions to\npromote his own understanding of true Christianity. Indeed, if his\nautobiographical memoir, written as a preface to his Opera\nomnia of 1679, is to be believed, More began to develop his own\nideas as a result of a schoolboy rejection of the Calvinist doctrine\nof predestination, which he saw as a morally indefensible position for\nGod to uphold, and therefore could not be part of true religion\n(translated into English in Ward 2000, 15\u201316; for a later\nexample of More\u2019s anti-Calvinism, see More 1668, 71\u201378).\nThis recollection is certainly revealing, not only about More\u2019s\nbeliefs, but also about his whole approach to religion. Like Calvin\nhimself, More wanted to establish a system of belief which conformed\nto what he saw as the dictates of reason. But reasoning from different\nstarting points can lead to very different conclusions. Calvin wanted\na God who was immutable and so the concept of predestination seemed to\nfollow as a rational requirement. More, by contrast, wanted a God who\nwas, above all, morally perfect and unimpeachable. His different\nstarting point from that of Calvin led him to a very different\nrational theology. More\u2019s was a theology in which God was\nobliged by his goodness to conform to absolute standards of morality,\nand therefore to create a world which was, as Voltaire\u2019s\n(1694\u20131778) Dr Pangloss would have said, the best of all\npossible worlds (Voltaire [1759] 1966, 2). More\u2019s motive in\npromoting this theology was not to solve the so-called \u201cproblem\nof evil\u201d (why God allows so much suffering in the world), as it\nwas later for Leibniz (and Dr Pangloss), but to ensure that God\ncreated a world which was (according to More at least) most capable of\nestablishing the Creator\u2019s own existence. More believed that the\nbest of all possible worlds was one which demonstrated its dependence\nupon God and thereby made atheism an untenable position. In his\nImmortality of the Soul (1659), for example, More wrote that\nGod \u201cordering the natures of things infallibly according to what\nis best, must of necessity ordain that the Souls of men live\nand act after death\u201d (More 1662, Immortality of the\nSoul, separately paginated, 144). Similarly, in Divine\nDialogues (1668), he wrote that the design in nature showed that\nGod always acted for the best (More 1668, 24). It was the effort to\ndemonstrate that God had indeed created the world this way which\ndictated all the various idiosyncrasies of More\u2019s philosophical\ntheology.\n\nThe earliest aspect of this was the attempt in his philosophical poems\nto establish a strict categorical separation between body and the\nincorporeal soul. The Psychodia platonica consisted of four\nparts, the first two, on the life of the soul (Psychozoia)\nand on its immortality (Pyschathanasia), presented\nMore\u2019s views. The third and fourth parts were refutations of\ncontemporary views of the soul which threatened More\u2019s strict\ndualistic ontology. Antipsychopannychia was concerned to\nreject the belief of the so-called mortalists that the soul sleeps in\nthe grave after death, only to be awoken at the same time as the\nresurrection of the body. Antimonopsychia rejected the\nnotion, usually attributed to the Arabic commentator on Aristotle know\nto the Latin West as Averroes (Ibn-Rushd), that the only tenable\nnotion of the soul in Aristotle was not a personal soul, but a single\ngeneral soul of humanity. Originally introduced into the West by a\nnumber of anti-Scholastic Aristotelian naturalists (from Siger of\nBrabant in the thirteenth century to Pietro Pomponazzi in the\nsixteenth) this idea was again becoming current among atheistic\ncontemporaries of More (Leech 2013).\n\nMore followed this up with what he called an essay, but which was\nstill written in sub-Spenserian stanzas, on \u201cthe Infinity of\nWorlds out of Platonick Principles\u201d. Democritus\nPlatonissans (1646), accordingly, is the part of More\u2019s\nphilosophical poem cycle which deals with the material side of the\ndualist dichotomy. He may have been inspired here by the Two\nTreatises of Sir Kenelm Digby (1603\u20131665) which had just\nappeared (1644), and which he mentions in the notes to his poem. Digby\ndeveloped a version of atomistic natural philosophy and argued that\nall change is nothing more or less than a re-arrangement of the\nmaterial atoms comprising all bodies. Consequently, Digby went on to\nargue, immaterial souls cannot change, and must therefore be immutable\nand immortal (Digby 1644, 350). More used the same general stratagem\nwith regard to the relationship between body and soul in his poem, and\nit was presumably during the writing of Democritus\nPlatonissans that More first became interested in the latest\ndevelopments in natural philosophy (Thomson 2008, 94). In particular,\nit was at this time that More began to study the philosophy of\nDescartes (1596\u20131650) (Gabbey 1982). Clearly, More was\nsufficiently aware of developments in natural philosophy to know that\nDigby\u2019s atomistic system was derivative from, and by no means as\npowerful as, the Principia philosophiae published in the same\nyear as Digby\u2019s Two Treatises by the great French\nmathematician turned metaphysician and physicist.\n\nAt around this time, More also began to embrace another Platonic idea,\nand one which had been introduced into Christian thought in the third\ncentury by Origen (though never accepted as orthodox), namely the\npre-existence of the individual soul before its incarnation (Reid\n2012, Hengstermann 2017). He devoted another poem to his first\nexposition of this, The Praeexistency of the Soul, which was\nincluded in his collected Philosophical Poems of 1647. This\nis a clear example of how More\u2019s pursuit of a rational theology\nled him to unusual, if not entirely idiosyncratic, positions. His\nPlatonic insistence on the immortality of the soul led him to reject\nthe notion that every individual human soul was created at its\nconception, in favour of the Origenian position that all intellectual\nnatures were created equal and alike from the beginning of eternity\n(Scott 1991). This was also bound up with More\u2019s concern for the\nperfect goodness of God\u2014More did not want to involve God in\ncolluding with the illicit sexual acts of sinners by intervening in\ntheir acts to create souls for their illegitimate progeny. As More\nlater put it in the notes to his edition of George Rust\u2019s\nOrigenian Discourse of Truth (1682), God must not be made to\n\u201cbear a part amongst Pimps and Bawds, and pocky whores and\nWhoremasters, to rise out of his Seat for them, and by a free Act of\nCreation of a Soul, to set his seal of connivance to their\nVillanies\u201d (More 1682, 9). Although More adopted the\npre-existence of souls, he did not embrace Origen\u2019s belief in\nuniversal salvation \u2014the idea that all souls would eventually be\nsaved and rewarded with heavenly bliss. Evidently, More took this\ndoctrine to undermine God\u2019s justice, and affirmed eternal\npunishment for sinners (Hengstermann 2017).\n\nThe decision to present and to defend what purported to be a\nrationally-based pneumatology in poetic form is certainly puzzling to\nthe modern reader, but it was also rather unusual in More\u2019s own\nday. Although there were clear ancient precedents, such as the epic\npresentation of Epicurean atomism in the De rerum natura of\nLucretius, the poetical presentation of philosophical ideas seemed to\nbe most common in alchemical, astrological, and other magical works,\nsuch as the Compound of Alchymy by George Ripley (c.\n1471), and the Zodiacus vitae of Marcellus Palingenius\n(c. 1531). It seems that More\u2019s determination to\npresent his ideas in verse is a manifestation of an undeniable\ntendency in him towards emotional rapture, particularly where matters\nof religion are concerned. Although intellectually committed to\nrationalism in religion, More\u2019s personal religious feelings were\nobviously deep-seated and could easily become highly emotional, and\neven close to what was decried at the time as a dangerous tendency in\nreligion, namely \u201centhusiasm\u201d. This was noted by\nMore\u2019s earliest biographer, Richard Ward:\n\nHe hath indeed confess\u2019d in a certain Place; That he had a\nNatural touch of Enthusiasme in his Complexion; but such as (he thanks\nGod) was ever governable enough; and which he had found at length\nperfectly Subduable. So that no Person better understood the Extent of\nPhansy, and Nature of Enthusiasme, than he himself did (Ward [1710]\n2000, 35).\n\n\nFor the most part, More did manage to subdue these potentially\ndangerous tendencies, but he often walked a razor\u2019s edge\n(Crocker 1990, 2003). It seems clear that More was torn between what\nhe saw as the need for a rational theology on the one hand and a much\nmore emotional submission to religious sensibilities. As Ward wrote\napprovingly:\n\nsuch is the Nature of his Noble Principles and Theories, such the\nFrame of his Conceptions; that they cannot fail (where embraced) of\nmore than ordinarily moving, and even enravishing, at times, the Mind\nof Man; and Carrying it away Captive into All the Highest Joy,\nAdmiration, and Affection, that the Humane Nature is capable of. They\nwill either find or make Enthusiasts of this kind\u2026 He himself,\nwith the Holy Psalmist, and others of the Divine Writers, shews a\nfrequent Enthusiasme in this way\u2026 (Ward 2000, 36).\n\n\nThis aspect of More\u2019s mental life must be borne in mind in any\nattempt to assess the coherence of his philosophy, and his\nsignificance as a philosopher. It was surely the demands of\nMore\u2019s religious concerns which account for those places (some\nof which will be discussed below) where his philosophical acuity\nseemed to desert him.\n\nMore can be seen to be walking along a narrow ledge above a precipice\nof religious enthusiasm in his polemic against the alchemist Thomas\nVaughan (1621\u20131666). Writing as Alazonomastix Philalethes, More\nlaunched an attack against Vaughan\u2019s recently published\nNeoplatonic and alchemically inspired views of man and nature. These\nwere More\u2019s first publications after finishing his cycle of\npoems. More felt obliged to attack Vaughan in print precisely because,\nto the undiscerning eye, their philosophies might seem to be\ncongruent. As More wrote:\n\nI was afraid that men judging that this affectation of Platonisme in\nyou, might well proceed from some intemperies of bloud and spirit; and\nthat, there [being] no body else besides us two dealing with these\nkinds of notions, they might yoke me with so disordered a companion as\nyourself: Reasoning thus with themselves; Vaughan of Jesus in Oxenford\nholds the pre-existence of the Soul, and other Platonick Paradoxes,\nand we see what a pickle he is in: What think you of More of\nChrist\u2019s that wrote the Platonicall Poems? (More 1651, 36)\n\n\nAlthough More professes to subscribe to a philosophy which is\nsignificantly distinct from that of Vaughan, it is by no means clear\nthat contemporary readers would have been able to see what the\ndifferences were. With hindsight, it can be seen that in these two\npolemical works More was trying to protect the concept which he had\nvery briefly introduced in his poetical works and which was to prove\nso important in his subsequent philosophy, namely the Spirit of Nature\n(discussed fully below). What is most obvious here, however, is not\nhow More conceived of this universal spirit, but that he did not see\nit in the same way that Vaughan did in his Anima magica\nabscondita: Or, A Discourse of the universall Spirit of Nature\n(1650). He objects unequivocally, for example, to the fact that\nVaughan seems to imply (on More\u2019s reading, anyway) that a\nuniversal world spirit or soul is divided and parcelled up into all\ncreatures, to give them life. More objects not only to Vaughan\u2019s\nsuggestion that the whole world is \u201can Animal\u201d, but also\nto the idea that the world soul can be \u201ceither barrel\u2019d up\nor bottled up, or tied up in a bag, as a pig in a poke!\u201d (More\n1650, 51). More\u2019s objection, reflecting his strict dualism, is\nthat an immaterial soul could not be trapped inside body. When More\nsubsequently develops his own concept of the Spirit of Nature into its\nmature form it is to be a continuous and all pervasive immaterial (but\nextended) substance which is capable of operating within bodies by\nvirtue of its ubiquity, but is not confined by them. The contemporary\nreader, however, could not have gleaned from More\u2019s\nObservations upon Anthroposophia Theomagica (1650), or his\nSecond Lash of Alazonomastix (1651), anything other than his\nobjections to Vaughan\u2019s views; there was little or no intimation\nof More\u2019s own still developing ideas.\n\nFurthermore, even here, while vigorously decrying Vaughan\u2019s\n\u201centhusiasm\u201d, More cannot prevent himself from revealing\nhis own tendencies in the same direction (Crocker 1990, 2003,\nGuinsberg 1980). The real nature of the union between soul and body,\nMore at one point unwisely declared, is \u201cmore Theomagicall then\nour Theomagician himself is aware of\u201d (More 1650, 52). It is a\nsign of the tension between More\u2019s rationalism and his need to\nexpress his religious devotion that he persisted in writing\nenthusiastically even when he was aware of so doing. His apologetic\nattempts to defend himself were hardly convincing: \u201cNor am I at\nall, Philalethes, Enthusiastical. For God doth not ride me as a Horse,\nand guide me I know not whither my self; but converseth with me as a\nFriend; and speaks to me in such a Dialect as I\nunderstand\u2026\u201d (More 1651, 178).\n",
