But in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence\nthat pornography is associated with a significant increase in violent\nsexual crime, liberals may continue to view the case for legal\nregulation as weak.\n\nHowever, the rights-based feminist arguments against pornography do\nnot rest entirely on the claim that consumption of pornography is a\nsignificant cause of violent sexual crime. The claim that pornography\ncontributes to women\u2019s inequality, and the claim that it violates\nwomen\u2019s right to freedom of speech, can rest on more moderate empirical\nclaims about which there is likely to be more agreement: for example,\nthat pornography helps to form and reinforce the view that women are\nsex objects, which manifests itself in how women are perceived and\ntreated in society and so perpetuates women\u2019s inequality. Among other\nthings, it may increase the likelihood of sexual harassment and other\nforms of discrimination against women, undermine women\u2019s credibility in\ncertain contexts, encourage a general expectation that women who say\n\u201cno\u201d in sexual contexts often do not intend to refuse, and\nso on.\n\nRonald Dworkin is one prominent liberal who has explicitly\nconsidered, and rejected, MacKinnon\u2019s version of the rights-based\narguments for anti-pornography legislation. This is not primarily\nbecause he rejects the moderate empirical claims. Rather it is because\nhe thinks that, even if those claims were true, there would be no\nlegitimate sense in which the publication and voluntary private\nconsumption of pornography violate women\u2019s civil rights.\n\nAccording to Dworkin, the argument for anti-pornography legislation\non the grounds that pornography subordinates women rests on the\n\u201cfrightening principle that considerations of equality require\nthat some people not be free to express their tastes or convictions or\npreferences anywhere\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 39). Accepting this\nprinciple would have \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d namely,\nthat \u201cgovernment could forbid the graphic or visceral or\nemotionally charged expression of any opinion that might reasonably\noffend a disadvantaged group. It could outlaw performances of The\nMerchant of Venice, or films about professional women who neglect\ntheir children, or caricatures or parodies of homosexuals in nightclub\nroutines.\u201d Dworkin\u2019s concern is a kind of logical slippery slope\nobjection that he takes to constitute a reductio of\nMacKinnon\u2019s view. The worry is that the principle that underpins\nMacKinnon\u2019s argument would, if consistently applied, threaten many\nother forms of speech in clearly unacceptable ways.\n\nNote that Dworkin construes \u2013 or misconstrues \u2013 MacKinnon\u2019s argument\nas a version of the old moralistic argument that objects to pornography\non grounds of its offensiveness; and, as we have seen, liberals reject\noffense as legitimate grounds for preventing the voluntary consumption\nof pornography in private. However, MacKinnon\u2019s argument does not \u2013 or\nneed not \u2013 rest on this \u201cfrightening\u201d principle. The\nfeminist case is not that pornography should be regulated because it\nexpresses opinions that are offensive to feminists. Rather, it should\nbe regulated because, offensive or not, it contributes significantly to\na regime of sexual inequality.\n\nNonetheless, this principle \u2013 that government is justified\nin prohibiting speech that contributes significantly to a group\u2019s\ninequality \u2013 is one that some liberals may find equally disturbing. For\nit may well apply to speech other than pornography, including perhaps\nthe examples that Dworkin mentions.\n\nDworkin is not alone in this concern. Other liberals and feminists\nhave questioned MacKinnon\u2019s focus on pornography as the key site of\nwomen\u2019s oppression when it seems that many other non-sexually\nexplicit materials plausibly also endorse and perpetuate a view of\nwomen as sex objects, albeit perhaps in less graphic and explicit\nforms. (Perhaps this lack of explicitness makes them more insidious,\nand hence of more, rather than less, concern.) Pornography may\nsexualize women\u2019s inequality, but advertising and romance\nnovels plausibly glamorize and romanticize it\nrespectively and hence may celebrate, authorize and legitimize women\u2019s\ninequality in the same way as pornography (e.g., Cocks 1989; Coward\n1984; Valverde 1985; Kappeler 1986; Skipper 1993). Indeed, some of\nthese other representations may be especially worrying, not simply\nbecause they may be more pervasive, but also insofar they may condition\nwomen to be complicit in their own subjection. MacKinnon\u2019s focus on the\ngraphic sexually explicit material that celebrates women\u2019s inequality\nmay thus seem arbitrary in the absence of evidence that the sexually\nexplicit subset of material is an especially significant cause of\nwomen\u2019s inequality.\n\nPerhaps there are principled, pragmatic reasons for singling out\npornography (i.e., the sexually explicit subset of the material that\nconditions people to view women as willing sex objects) for censorship\nor regulation, even if we were to agree that non-sexually explicit\nmaterial may also condition consumers to this view of women. It might\nbe that censorship of pornography would alleviate a considerable amount\nof this harm, without incurring the same costs as censoring some or all\nof the non-sexually explicit material that contributes to the harm. But\nthis is controversial.\n\nWhat about the claim that pornography violates women\u2019s right to\nfreedom of speech? The argument rests on a \u201cdangerous\nconfusion,\u201d Dworkin thinks: the confusion of positive and\nnegative liberty. It rests on the \u201cunacceptable proposition: that\nthe right to free speech includes a right to circumstances that\nencourage one to speak, and a right that others grasp and respect what\none means to say\u2026.These are obviously not rights that any\nsociety can recognise or enforce. Creationists, flat-earthers, and\nbigots, for example, are ridiculed in many parts of America now; that\nridicule undoubtedly dampens the enthusiasm that many of them have for\nspeaking out and limits the attention others pay to what they have to\nsay\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 38). But, Dworkin suggests, we surely should\nnot think that this violates their right to freedom of speech: e.g.,\nthat creationists have a legitimate claim on the state to ban the\npublication of books or videos recommending the theory of evolution on\nthe grounds that these may cause the speech of creationists to receive\nan unsympathetic or dismissive reception.\n\nDworkin concedes that it is perhaps true that the right to freedom\nof speech, if it is to be meaningful, requires that everyone has some\nopportunity to have their ideas heard: a society in which only the rich\nand powerful have access to the media may be one in which there is not\ngenuine freedom of speech. But it goes far beyond this, Dworkin thinks,\nto claim that a meaningful right to freedom of speech requires \u201ca\nguarantee of a sympathetic or even competent understanding of what one\nsays\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 38). This would license state regulation of\nspeech on a massive scale, paving the way to terrible\n\u201ctyranny\u201d (Dworkin 1993, 42).\n\nA number of commentators have developed Mackinnon\u2019s claims in the\nface of Dworkin\u2019s response, arguing that, to be valuable, freedom of\nspeech must be more than simply being free to produce and distribute\nsounds and symbols that have a meaning in a language. It requires, in\naddition, that there are not systematic barriers to audience\n\u201cuptake\u201d of speech\u2014i.e., that audiences are not\nsystematically prevented from recognizing speakers\u2019 communicative\nintentions (e.g., Hornsby and Langton 1998; West 2003; for replies, see\nJacobson 2001; Green 1998). In different ways, these commentators argue\nthat the traditional liberal conception of free speech, and of the\nright to free speech, fails to pay sufficient attention to the way\nlanguage works and, in particular, to the way in which what words\nmean \u2013 and so what it is possible for speakers to communicate or\ndo with their words \u2013 depends on social context, a context that\npornography may help to shape and perpetuate.\n\nThe traditional liberal conception of freedom of speech assumes that\npeople are free to speak just so long they are not prevented from\nproducing meaningful sounds and scrawls that others are not prevented\nfrom hearing or viewing. But we might wonder whether this is sufficient\nto protect free speech, even by liberals\u2019 own lights. A society that\npermitted the distribution of meaningful sounds and symbols, but\nsomehow managed systematically to prevent those sounds and symbols from\nbeing comprehended by audiences, would be little better as far as free\nspeech values are concerned than a society that simply prevented\ndistribution of meaningful noises altogether. Either way, speakers are\nprevented from communicating their opinions to others, which defeats\nwhat liberals take to be the point of free speech: the right of\nspeakers not to be prevented by the actions of other agents from\ncommunicating their feelings and opinions to others who might wish to\nhear them (West 2003).\n",
