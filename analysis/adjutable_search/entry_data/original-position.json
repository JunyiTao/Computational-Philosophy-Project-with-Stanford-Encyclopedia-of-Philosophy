    "preamble": "\n\nThe original position is a central feature of John Rawls\u2019s\nsocial contract account of justice, \u201cjustice as fairness,\u201d\nset forth in A Theory of Justice (TJ). The original position\nis designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that is to be\nadopted in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice. In\ntaking up this point of view, we are to imagine ourselves in the\nposition of free and equal persons who jointly agree upon and commit\nthemselves to principles of social and political justice for a\nwell-ordered democratic society. The main distinguishing feature of\nthe original position is \u201cthe veil of ignorance\u201d: To\nensure complete impartiality of judgment, the parties are deprived of\nall knowledge of their personal characteristics and conceptions of the\ngood, and of social and historical circumstances. They do know of\ncertain fundamental interests they all have in exercising their moral\npowers, plus general facts about psychology, economics, political\nsociology, biology, and other social and natural sciences. The parties\nin the original position are presented with a list of the major\nconceptions of justice drawn from the tradition of social and\npolitical philosophy and are assigned the task of choosing from among\nthese the conception of justice that best enables them to effectively\npursue their final ends and commitments and their fundamental\ninterests. Rawls contends that the most rational decision for the\nparties in the original position are the two principles of justice:\nThe first principle guarantees the equal basic rights and liberties\nneeded to secure the fundamental interests of free and equal citizens\nand to pursue a wide range of conceptions of the good. The basic\nliberties include freedom of conscience, thought, expression, and\nassociation; freedom and integrity of the person with the right to\nhold personal property; equal political liberties, and rights\nprotected by the rule of law. The second principle regulates\npermissible social and economic inequalities: first it provides fair\nequality of educational, employment, and cultural opportunities that\nenable all to develop their capacities and fairly compete for social\npositions of office and responsibility. Next, the second principle\nrequires economic inequalities of income, wealth, powers and\nprerogatives to be arranged to maximally benefit the least advantaged\nmembers of society, making them better off than they would be in any\nalternative economic system (the difference principle.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historical Background: The Moral Point of View\n\nThe idea of the moral point of view can be traced back to David\nHume\u2019s account of the \u201cjudicious spectator.\u201d Hume\nsought to explain how moral judgments of approval and disapproval are\npossible given that people normally are focused on achieving their own\ninterests and concerns. He conjectured that in making moral judgments\nindividuals abstract in imagination from their own interests and adopt\nan impartial point of view from which they assess the effects of their\nown and others\u2019 actions on the interests of everyone. Since,\naccording to Hume, we all can adopt this impartial perspective in\nimagination, it accounts for our agreement in moral judgments (see\nHume 1739 [1978, 581]; Rawls, LHMP 84\u201393, LHPP\n184\u2013187).\n\nSubsequently, philosophers posited similar perspectives for moral\nreasoning designed to yield impartial judgments once individuals\nabstract from their own aims and interests and assess situations from\nan impartial point of view. But rather than being mainly explanatory\nof moral judgments like Hume\u2019s \u201cjudicious\nspectator,\u201d the role of these impartial perspectives is to serve\nas a basis from which to assess and justify moral rules and\nprinciples. Kant\u2019s categorical imperative procedure, Adam\nSmith\u2019s \u201cimpartial spectator,\u201d, and Sidgwick\u2019s\n\u201cpoint of view of the universe\u201d are all different versions\nof the moral point of view.\n\nAn important feature of the moral point of view is that it is designed\nto represent what is essential to the activity of moral reasoning. For\nexample, Kant\u2019s categorical imperative is envisioned as a point\nof view any reasonable morally motivated person can adopt in\ndeliberating about what they ought morally to do (Rawls, CP 498ff;\nLHMP). When joined with the common assumption that the totality of\nmoral reasons is final and override non-moral reasons, the moral point\nof view might be regarded as the most fundamental perspective that we\ncan adopt in our reasoning about justice and what we morally ought to\ndo.\n\nRawls\u2019s idea of the original position, as initially conceived,\nis his account of the moral point of view regarding matters of\njustice. The original position is a hypothetical perspective that we\ncan adopt in our moral reasoning about the most basic principles of\nsocial and political justice. What primarily distinguishes\nRawls\u2019s impartial perspective from its antecedents (in Hume,\nSmith, Kant, etc.) is that, rather than representing the judgment of\none person, it is conceived socially, as a general agreement by\n(representatives of all adult) members of an ongoing society. The\npoint of view of justice is then represented as a general\n\u201csocial contract\u201d or agreement by free and equal persons\non the basic terms of cooperation for their society.\n2. The Original Position and Social Contract Doctrine\n\nHistorically the idea of a social contract had a more limited role\nthan Rawls assigns to it. In Thomas Hobbes and John Locke the social\ncontract serves as an argument for the legitimacy of political\nauthority. Hobbes argues that in a pre-social state of nature it would\nbe rational for all to agree to authorize one person to exercise the\nabsolute political power needed to maintain peace and enforce laws\nnecessary for productive social cooperation. (Hobbes, 1651) By\ncontrast, Locke argued against absolute monarchy by contending that no\nexisting political constitution is legitimate or just unless it\ncould be contracted into starting from a position of equal\nright within a (relatively peaceful) state of nature, and without\nviolating any natural rights or duties. (Locke, 1690) For Rousseau and\nperhaps Kant too, the idea of a social contract plays a different\nrole: It is an \u201cidea of reason\u201d (Kant) depicting a point\nof view that lawmakers and citizens should adopt in their reasoning to\nascertain the \u201cgeneral will,\u201d which enables them to assess\nexisting laws and decide upon measures that promote justice and\ncitizens\u2019 common good. (Rousseau, 1762; Kant, 1793, 296\u20137;\nKant 1797, 480) Rawls generalizes on Locke\u2019s, Rousseau\u2019s\nand Kant\u2019s natural rights theories of the social contract (TJ\nvii/xviii rev.; 32/28 rev.): The purpose of his original position is\nto yield principles to determine and assess the justice of political\nconstitutions and of economic and social arrangements and the laws\nthat sustain them. To do so, he seeks in the original position\n\u201cto combine into one conception the totality of conditions which\nwe are ready upon due reflection to recognize as reasonable in our\nconduct towards one another\u201d (TJ 587/514 rev.).\n\nWhy does Rawls represent principles of justice as originating in a\nkind of social contract? Rawls says that \u201cjustice as fairness\nassigns a certain primacy to the social\u201d (CP 339). Unlike\nKant\u2019s categorical imperative procedure, the original position\nis designed to represent the predominantly social bases of justice. To\nsay that justice is predominantly social does not mean that people do\nnot have \u201cnatural\u201d moral rights and duties outside society\nor in non-cooperative circumstances\u2014Rawls clearly thinks there\nare human rights (see LP, \u00a710) and certain \u201cnatural\nduties\u201d (TJ, \u00a7\u00a719, 51) that apply to all human beings\nas such. But whatever our natural or human rights and duties may be,\nthey do not provide an adequate basis for ascertaining the rights and\nduties of justice that we owe one another as members of the same\nongoing political society. It is in large part due to \u201cthe\nprofoundly social nature of human relationships\u201d (PL 259) that\nRawls sees political and economic justice as grounded in social\ncooperation on terms of reciprocity and mutual respect. For this\nreason Rawls eschews the idea of a state of nature where pre-social\nbut fully rational individuals agree to cooperative terms (as in\nHobbesian views), or where pre-political persons with antecedent\nnatural rights agree on the form of a political constitution (as in\nLocke). Rawls regards us as social beings in the sense that in the\nabsence of society and social development we have but inchoate and\nunrealized capacities, including our capacities for rationality,\nmorality, even language itself. As Rousseau says, outside society we\nare but \u201cstupid and shortsighted animals\u201d (Rousseau, 1762,\nbk.I, ch.8, par. 1). This draws into question the main point of the\nidea of a state of nature in Hobbesian and Lockean views, which is to\ndistinguish the rights, claims, duties, powers and competencies we\nhave prior to membership in society from those we acquire as members\nof society. Not being members of some society is not an option for us.\nIn so far as we are rational and reasonable beings at all, we have\ndeveloped as members of some society, within its social framework and\ninstitutions. Accordingly Rawls says that no sense can be made of the\nnotion of that part of an individual\u2019s social benefits that\nexceed what would have been that person\u2019s situation in a state\nof nature (PL 278). The traditional idea of pre-social or even\npre-political rational moral agents thus plays no role in\nRawls\u2019s account of justice and the social contract; for him the\nstate of nature is an idea without moral significance (PL\n278\u2013280). The original position is set forth largely as an\nalternative to the state of nature and is regarded by Rawls as the\nappropriate initial situation for a social contract. (Below we\nconsider a further reason behind Rawls\u2019s rejection of the state\nof nature: it does not adequately allow for impartial judgment and the\nequality of persons.)\n\nAnother way Rawls represents the \u201cprofoundly social\u201d bases\nof principles of justice is by focusing on \u201cthe basic structure\nof society.\u201d The \u201cfirst subject of justice,\u201d Rawls\nsays, is principles that regulate the basic social institutions that\nconstitute the \u201cbasic structure of society\u201d (TJ sect.2).\nThese basic institutions include the political constitution, which\nspecifies political offices and procedures for legislating and\nenforcing laws and the system of trials for adjudicating disputes; the\nbases and organization of the economic system, including laws of\nproperty, its transfer and distribution, contractual relations, etc.\nwhich are all necessary for economic production, exchange, and\nconsumption; and finally norms that define and regulate permissible\nforms of the family, which is necessary to reproduce and perpetuate\nsociety from one generation to the next. It is the role of principles\nof justice to specify and assess the system of rules that constitute\nthese basic institutions, and determine the fair distribution of\nrights, duties, opportunities, powers and positions of office, and\nincome and wealth realized within them. What makes these basic social\ninstitutions and their arrangement the first subject for principles of\nsocial justice is that they are all necessary to social cooperation\nand have such profound influences on our circumstances, aims,\ncharacters, and future prospects. No stable, enduring society could\nexist without certain rules of property, contract, and transfer of\ngoods and resources, for they make economic production, trade, and\nconsumption possible. Nor could a society long endure without some\npolitical mechanism for resolving disputes and making, revising,\ninterpreting, and enforcing its economic and other cooperative norms;\nnor without some form of the family, to reproduce, sustain, and\nnurture members of its future generations. This is what distinguishes\nthe social institutions constituting the basic structure from other\nprofoundly influential social institutions, such as religion; religion\nand other social institutions are not basic in Rawls\u2019s sense\nbecause they are not generally necessary to social cooperation among\nmembers of society. (Even if certain religions have been ideologically\nnecessary to sustain the norms of particular societies, many societies\ncan and do exist without the involvement or support of religious\ninstitutions).\n\nAnother reason Rawls regards the original position as the appropriate\nsetting for a social contract is implicit in his stated aim in A\nTheory of Justice: it is to discover the most appropriate moral\nconception of justice for a democratic society wherein persons regard\nthemselves as free and equal citizens (TJ viii/xviii rev.). Here he\nassumes an ideal of citizens as \u201cmoral persons\u201d who regard\nthemselves as free and equal, have a conception of their rational\ngood, and have a \u201csense of justice.\u201d \u201cMoral\npersons\u201d (an 18th century term) are not all\nnecessarily morally good persons. Instead moral persons are persons\nwho are capable of being rational since they have the\ncapacities to form, revise and pursue a rational conception of their\ngood; moreover, moral persons also are capable of being\nreasonable since they have a moral capacity for a sense of\njustice\u2014to cooperate with others on terms that are fair and to\nunderstand, apply, and act upon principles of justice and their\nrequirements. Because people have these capacities, or \u201cmoral\npowers,\u201d (as Rawls calls them, following Kant) we hold them\nresponsible for their actions, and they are regarded as capable of\nfreely pursuing their interests and engaging in social cooperation.\nRawls\u2019s idea is that, being reasonable and rational, moral\npersons (like us) who regard ourselves as free and equal should be in\na position to accept and endorse as both rational and morally\njustifiable the principles of justice regulating our basic social\ninstitutions and individual conduct. Otherwise, our conduct is coerced\nor manipulated for reasons we cannot (reasonably or rationally) accept\nand we are not fundamentally free persons. Starting from these\nassumptions, Rawls construes the moral point of view from which to\ndecide moral principles of justice as a social contract in\nwhich (representatives of) free and equal persons are given the task\nof coming to an agreement on principles of justice that are to\nregulate their social and political relations in perpetuity. How\notherwise, Rawls contends, should we represent the justification of\nprinciples of justice for free and equal persons who have different\nconceptions of their good, as well as different religious,\nphilosophical, and moral views? There is no commonly accepted moral or\nreligious authority or doctrine to which they could appeal in order to\ndiscover principles of justice that all could agree to and accept.\nRawls contends that, since his aim is to discover a conception of\njustice appropriate for a democratic society, it should be justifiable\nto free and equal persons in their capacity as citizens on terms which\nall can endorse and accept. The role of the social contract is to\nrepresent this idea, that the basic principles of social cooperation\nare justifiable hence acceptable to all reasonable and rational\nmembers of society, and that they are principles which all can commit\nthemselves to support and comply with.\n\nHow is this social contract to be conceived? It is not an historical\nevent that must actually take place at some point in time (TJ 120/104\nrev.ed.). It is rather a hypothetical situation, a kind of\n\u201cthought experiment\u201d (JF 17), that is designed to uncover\nthe most reasonable principles of justice. Rawls maintains (in LHPP,\ncf. p.15) that the major advocates of social contract\ndoctrine\u2014Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant\u2014all regarded\nthe social contract, as a hypothetical event. Hobbes and Locke thus\nposited a hypothetical state of nature in which there is no political\nauthority, and where people are regarded as rational and (for Locke)\nalso reasonable. The purpose of this hypothetical social contract is\nto demonstrate what types of political constitutions and governments\nare politically legitimate, and determine the nature of\nindividuals\u2019 political obligations (LHPP p.16). The\npresumption is that if a constitution or form government could be\nagreed to by rational persons subject to it according to principles\nand terms they all accept, then it should be acceptable to rational\npersons generally, including you and me, and hence is legitimate and\nis the source of our political obligations. Thus, Hobbes argues that\nall rational persons in a state of nature would agree to authorize an\nabsolute sovereign to enforce the \u201claws of nature\u201d\nnecessary for society; whereas Locke comes to the opposite conclusion,\ncontending that absolutism would be rejected in favor of\nconstitutional monarchy with a representative assembly. Similarly, in\nRousseau and Kant, the social contract is a way to reason about the\nGeneral Will, including the political constitution and laws that\nhypothetical moral agents would all agree to in order to promote the\ncommon good and realize the freedom and equality of citizens.\n(Rousseau, 1762, I:6, p.148; II:1, p.153; II:11, p.170; Kant, 1793,\n296\u20137; Kant 1797, 480; cf. Rawls, LHPP, 214\u201348).\n\nRawls employs the idea of a hypothetical social contract for more\ngeneral purposes than his predecessors. He aims to provide principles\nof justice that can be applied to determine not only the justice of\npolitical constitutions and the laws, but also the justice of the\ninstitution of property and of social and economic arrangements for\nthe production and distribution of income and wealth, as well as the\ndistribution of educational and work opportunities, and of powers and\npositions of office and responsibility.\n\nSome have objected that hypothetical agreements cannot bind or\nobligate people; only actual contracts or agreements can impose\nobligations and commitments (Dworkin, 1977, 150ff). But the original\nposition is not intended to impose new obligations on us; rather it is\na device for discovery and justification: It is to be used, as Rawls\nsays, \u201cto help us work out what we now think\u201d (CP 402); it\nincorporates \u201cconditions\u2026we do in fact accept\u201d (TJ\n587/514 rev.) and is a kind of \u201cthought experiment for the\npurpose of public- and self-clarification\u201d (JF, p.17).\nHypothetical agreement in the original position does not then bind\nanyone to duties or commitments they do not already have. Its point\nrather is to help discover and explicate the requirements of our moral\nconcepts of justice and enable us to draw the consequences of\nconsidered moral convictions of justice that we all presumably share.\nWhether we in turn consciously accept or agree to these consequences\nand the principles and duties they implicate once brought to our\nawareness does not undermine their moral justification. The point\nrather of conjecturing the outcome of a hypothetical agreement is\nthat, if the premises underlying the original position correctly\nrepresent our most deeply held considered moral convictions and\nconcepts of justice, then we are morally and rationally committed to\nendorsing the resulting principles and duties whether or not we\nactually accept or agree to them. Not to do so implies a failure to\naccept and live up to the consequences of our own moral convictions\nabout justice.\n\nHere critics may deny that the original position incorporates\nall the relevant reasons and considered moral convictions for\njustifying principles of justice (e.g. it omits beneficence,\nor the parties\u2019 knowledge of their final ends), and/or that some\nreasons it incorporates are not relevant to moral justification to\nbegin with (such as the publicity of fundamental principles,\nas utilitarians argue, Sidgwick, 1907, or the separateness or\npersons, temporal neutrality and rationality of the\nparties in promoting their own conception of the good). (Parfit,\n1985, 163, 336; Cohen, G.A., 2009; Cohen, J., 2015,). Or they may\nargue that the state or nature, not the original position, is the\nappropriate perspective from which to ascertain fundamental principles\nof justice, since individuals moral and property rights are pre-social\nand not dependent upon social cooperation. (Nozick, 1974,\n183\u2013231).\n3. The Veil of Ignorance\n\nRawls calls his conception \u201cjustice as fairness.\u201d His aim\nin designing the original position is to describe an agreement\nsituation that is fair among all the parties to the hypothetical\nsocial contract. He assumes that if the parties are fairly situated\nand take all relevant information into account, then the principles\nthey agree to are also fair. The fairness of the original agreement\nsituation transfers to the principles everyone agrees to; furthermore,\nwhatever laws or institutions are required by the principles of\njustice are also fair. The principles of justice chosen in the\noriginal position are in this way the result of a choice procedure\ndesigned to \u201cincorporate pure procedural justice at the highest\nlevel\u201d (CP, 310, cf. TJ 120/104). This feature of Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position is closely related to his constructivism, and his\nsubsequent understanding of the original position as a\n\u201cprocedure of construction\u201d; see the supplementary\nsection:\n\nConstructivism, Objectivity, Autonomy, and the Original Position,\n \n\nin the supplementary document\n Further Topics on the Original Position.\n\nThere are different ways to define a fair agreement situation\ndepending on the purpose of the agreement and the description of the\nparties to it. For example, certain facts are relevant to entering a\nfair employment contract \u2013 knowledge of a prospective\nemployee\u2019s talents, skills, prior training, experience,\nmotivation, and reliability \u2013 that may not be relevant to other\nfair agreements. What is a fair agreement situation among free and\nequal persons when the purpose of the agreement is fundamental\nprinciples of justice for the basic structure of society? What sort of\nfacts should the parties to such a fundamental social contract know,\nand what sort of facts are irrelevant or even prejudicial to a fair\nagreement? Here it is helpful to compare Rawls\u2019s and\nLocke\u2019s social contracts. A feature of Locke\u2019s social\ncontract is that it transpires in a state of nature among free and\nequal persons who know everything about themselves that you and I know\nabout ourselves and each other. Thus, Locke\u2019s parties know their\nnatural talents, skills, education, and other personal\ncharacteristics; their racial and ethnic group, gender, social class,\nand occupations; their level of wealth and income, their religious and\nmoral beliefs, and so on. Given this knowledge, Locke assumes that,\nwhile starting from a position of equal political right, the great\nmajority of free and equal persons in a state of nature \u2013\nincluding all women and racial minorities, and all other men who do\nnot meet a rigid property qualification \u2013 could and most likely\nwould rationally agree to alienate their natural rights of equal\npolitical jurisdiction in order to gain the benefits of political\nsociety. Thus, Locke envisions as legitimate a constitutional monarchy\nthat is in effect a gender-and-racially biased class state wherein a\nsmall restricted class of amply propertied white males exercise\npolitical rights to vote, hold office, exercise political and social\ninfluence, and enjoy other important benefits and responsibilities to\nthe exclusion of everyone else (see Rawls, LHPP, 138\u2013139).\n\nThe problem with this arrangement, of course, is that gender and\nracial classifications, social class, wealth and lack thereof, are,\nlike absence of religious belief, not good reasons for depriving free\nand equal persons of their equal political rights or opportunities to\noccupy social and political positions. Knowledge of these and other\nfacts are not then morally relevant for deciding who should qualify to\nvote, hold office, and actively participate in governing and\nadministering society. Rawls suggests that the reason Locke\u2019s\nsocial contract results in this unjust outcome is that it transpires\n(hypothetically) under unfair conditions of a state of nature, where\nthe parties have complete knowledge of their circumstances,\ncharacteristics and social situations. Socially powerful and wealthy\nparties then have access to and can unfairly benefit from their\nknowledge of their \u201cfavorable position and exercise their threat\nadvantage\u201d to extract favorable terms of cooperation for\nthemselves from those in less favorable positions (JF 16).\nConsequently, the parties\u2019 judgments regarding constitutional\nprovisions are biased by their knowledge of their particular\ncircumstances and their decisions are insufficiently impartial.\n\nThe remedy for such biases of judgment is to redefine the initial\nsituation within which the social contract transpires. Rather than a\nstate of nature Rawls situates the parties to the social contract so\nthat they do not have access to factual knowledge that can distort\ntheir judgments and result in unfair principles. Rawls\u2019s\noriginal position is an initial agreement situation wherein the\nparties are without information enabling them to tailor principles of\njustice favorable to their personal circumstances and interests. Among\nthe essential features of the original position are that no one knows\ntheir place in society, class position, wealth, or social status, nor\ndoes anyone know their race, gender, fortune or misfortune in the\ndistribution of natural assets and abilities, level of intelligence,\nstrength, education, and the like. Rawls even assumes that the parties\ndo not know their values or \u201cconceptions of the good,\u201d\ntheir religious or philosophical convictions, or their special\npsychological propensities. The principles of justice are chosen\nbehind a \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d (TJ 12/11). This veil of\nignorance deprives the parties of all knowledge of particular facts\nabout themselves, about one another, and even about their society and\nits history.\n\nThe parties are not however completely ignorant of facts. They know\nall kinds of general facts about persons and societies, including\nknowledge of relatively uncontroversial scientific laws and\ngeneralizations accepted within the natural and social sciences\n\u2013 economics, psychology, political science, biology, and other\nnatural sciences (including applications of Darwinian evolutionary\ntheory that are generally accepted by scientists, however\ncontroversial they may be among religious fundamentalists). They know\nthen about the general tendencies of human behavior and psychological\ndevelopment, about neuropsychology and biological evolution, and about\nhow economic markets work, including neo-classical price theory of\nsupply and demand. As discussed below, they also know about the\ncircumstances of justice\u2014moderate scarcity and limited\naltruism\u2014as well as the desirability of the \u201cprimary\nsocial goods\u201d that are needed by anyone in modern society to\nlive a good life and to develop their \u201cmoral powers\u201d and\nother capacities. What the parties lack however is knowledge of any\nparticular facts about their own and other persons\u2019 lives, as\nwell as knowledge of any historical facts about their society and its\npopulation, its level of wealth and resources, religious institutions,\netc.. Rawls thinks that since the parties are required to come to an\nagreement on objective principles that supply universal standards of\njustice applying across all societies, knowledge of particular and\nhistorical facts about any person or society is morally irrelevant and\npotentially prejudicial to their decision.\n\nAnother reason Rawls gives for such a \u201cthick\u201d veil of\nignorance is that it is designed to be a strict \u201cposition of\nequality\u201d (TJ 12/11) that represents persons purely in their\ncapacity as free and equal moral persons. The parties in the original\nposition do not know any particular facts about themselves or society;\nthey all have the same general information. They are then situated\nequally in a very strong way, \u201csymmetrically\u201d (JF 18) and\npurely as free and equal moral persons. They know only characteristics\nand interests they share in their capacity as free and equal moral\npersons\u2014their \u201chigher-order interests\u201d in developing\nthe moral powers of justice and rationality, their need for the\nprimary social goods, and so on. The moral powers, Rawls contends, are\nthe \u201cbasis of equality, the features of human beings in virtue\nof which they are to be treated in accordance with the principles of\njustice\u201d (TJ, 504/441). Knowledge of the moral powers and their\nessential role in social cooperation, along with knowledge of other\ngeneral facts, is all that is morally relevant, Rawls believes, to a\ndecision on principles of justice that are to reflect people\u2019s\nstatus as free and equal moral persons. A thick veil of ignorance thus\nis designed to represent the equality of persons purely as moral\npersons, and not in any other contingent capacity or social role. In\nthis regard the veil of ignorance interprets the Kantian idea of\nequality as equal respect for moral persons (cf. CP 255).\n\nMany criticisms have been leveled against Rawls\u2019s veil of\nignorance. Among the more common criticisms are that the\nparties\u2019 choice in the original position is indeterminate (Sen,\n2009, 11\u201312, 56\u201358), or would result in choice of the\nprinciple of (average) utility (Harsanyi, 1975), or a principle of\nrelative prioritarianism that gives greater weight to but does not\nmaximize the least advantaged position (Buchak, 2017) (The argument\nfor the choice of the principle of average utility is discussed\nbelow.) Among reasons given for the indeterminacy of decision in the\noriginal position are that the parties are deprived of so much\ninformation about themselves that they are psychologically incapable\nof making a choice; or they cannot decide between a plurality of\nreasonable principles. (Sen 2009, 56\u201358). Or they are incapable\nof making a rational choice, since we cannot decide upon\nethical principles without knowing our primary purposes in life, the\nvalues of community, or certain other final ends and commitments.\n(MacIntyre, 1981; Sandel 1982)\n\nOne answer to to the criticism of inability to make a rational choice\ndue to ignorance of our final ends is that we do not need to know\neverything about ourselves, including these primary purposes, to make\nrational decisions about the background social conditions needed to\npursue these primary purposes. For example, whatever our ends, we know\nthat personal security and an absence of social chaos are conditions\nof most anyone\u2019s living a good life (as Hobbes contends).\nSimilarly, though Rawls\u2019s parties do not know their own values\nand commitments, they do know that as free and equal persons they\nrequire an adequate share of primary social goods (rights and\nliberties, powers and opportunities, income and wealth, and the social\nbases of self-respect) to effectively pursue their purposes, whatever\nthey may be. They also know they have a \u201chigher-order\ninterest\u201d in adequately developing and exercising their\n\u201cmoral powers\u201d \u2013 the capacities to be rational and\nreasonable \u2013 which are conditions of responsible agency,\neffectively pursuing one\u2019s purposes, and engaging in social\ncooperation. Rawls contends that knowledge of these \u201cessential\ngoods\u201d is sufficient for a rational choice on principles of\njustice by the parties in the original position.\n\nTo the objection that choice behind the veil of ignorance is\npsychologically impossible, Rawls says that it is important not to get\ntoo caught up in the theoretical fiction of the original position, as\nif it were some historical event among real people who are being asked\nto do something impossible. The original position is not supposed to\nbe realistic but is a \u201cdevice of representation\u201d (PL 27),\nor a \u201cthought experiment,\u201d (JF, 83), that is designed to\norganize our considered convictions of justice and clarify their\nimplications. The parties in it are not real but are \u201cartificial\npersons\u201d who have a role to play in this thought experiment.\nThey represent an ideal of free and equal reasonable and rational\nmoral persons that Rawls assumes is implicit in our reasoning about\njustice. The veil of ignorance is a representation of the kinds of\nreasons and information that are relevant to a decision on principles\nof justice for the basic structure of a society of free and equal\nmoral persons (TJ 17/16). Many kinds of reasons and facts are not\nmorally relevant to that kind of decision (e.g., information about\npeople\u2019s race, gender, religious affiliation, wealth, and even,\nRawls says more controversially, their conceptions of their good),\njust as many different kinds of reasons and facts are irrelevant to\nmathematicians\u2019 ability to work out the formal proof of a\ntheorem. As a mathematician, scientist, or musician exercise their\nexpertise by ignoring knowledge of particular facts about themselves,\npresumably we can do so too in reasoning about principles of justice\nfor the basic structure of society. Rawls says we can \u201center the\noriginal position at any time simply by reasoning in accordance with\nthe enumerated restrictions on information,\u201d (PL 27) and\nconsidering general facts about persons, their needs, and social and\neconomic cooperation that are provided to the parties (TJ 120/104,\n587/514).\n\nA related criticism of Rawls\u2019s \u201cthick\u201d veil of\nignorance is that even if the parties can make certain rational\ndecisions in their interest without knowledge of their final ends,\nstill they cannot come to a decision about principles of justice\nwithout knowing the desires and interests of people. For justice\nconsists of the measures that most effectively promote good\nconsequences, and these ultimately reflect facts about\nindividuals\u2019 utility or welfare. This criticism is mirrored in\nutilitarian versions of the moral point of view, which incorporate a\n\u201cthin\u201d veil of ignorance that represents a different idea\nof impartiality. The impartial sympathetic spectator found in David\nHume and Adam Smith, or the self-interested rational chooser in John\nHarsanyi\u2019s average utilitarian account, all have complete\nknowledge of everyone\u2019s desires, interests and purposes as well\nas knowledge of particular facts about people and their historical\nsituations. Impartiality is achieved by depriving the impartial\nobserver or rational chooser of any knowledge of its own identity.\nThis leads it to give equal consideration to everyone\u2019s desires\nand interests, and impartially take everyone\u2019s desires and\ninterests into account. Since rationality is presumed to involve\nmaximizing something \u2013 or taking the most effective means to\npromote the greatest realization of one\u2019s ends \u2013 the\nimpartial observer/chooser rationally chooses the rule or course of\naction that maximizes the satisfaction of desires, or utility\n(aggregate or average), summed across all persons. (See TJ,\n\u00a730)\n\nRawls\u2019s original position with its \u201cthick\u201d veil of\nignorance represents a different conception of impartiality than the\nutilitarian requirement that equal consideration be given to\neveryone\u2019s desires, preferences, or interests. The original\nposition abstracts from all information about current circumstances\nand the status quo, including everyone\u2019s desires and particular\ninterests. Utilitarians assume peoples\u2019 desires and interests\nare given by their circumstances and seek to maximize their\nsatisfaction; in so doing utilitarians suspend judgment regarding the\nmoral permissibility of peoples\u2019 desires, preferences, and ends\nand of the social circumstances and institutions within which these\nare shaped and cultivated. For Rawls, a primary reason for a thick\nveil of ignorance is to enable an unbiased assessment of the justice\nof existing social and political institutions and of existing desires,\npreferences, and conceptions of the good that they sustain.\nPeople\u2019s desires and purposes are not then assumed to be given,\nwhatever they are, and then promoted and fulfilled. On Rawls\u2019s\nKantian view, principles of right and justice are designed to put\nlimits on what satisfactions and purposes have value and impose\nrestrictions on what are reasonable conceptions of persons\u2019\ngood. This basically is what Rawls means by \u201cthe priority of\nright over the good.\u201d People\u2019s desires and\naspirations are constrained from the outset by principles of justice,\nwhich specify the criteria for determining permissible ends and\nconceptions of the good. (TJ 31\u201332/27\u201328) If the parties\nto Rawls\u2019s original position had knowledge of peoples\u2019\nbeliefs and desires, as well as knowledge of the laws, institutions\nand circumstances of their society, then this knowledge would\ninfluence their decisions on principles of justice. The principles\nagreed to would then not be sufficiently detached from the very\ndesires, circumstances, and institutions these principles are to\ncritically assess. Since utilitarians take peoples\u2019 desires,\npreferences, and/or ends as given under existing circumstances, any\nprinciples, laws, or institutions chosen behind their thin veil of\nignorance will reflect and be biased by the status quo. To take an\nobvious counterexample, there is little if any justice in laws\napproved from a utilitarian impartial perspective when these laws take\ninto account racially prejudiced preferences which are cultivated by\ngrossly unequal, racially discriminatory and segregated social\nconditions. To impartially give equal consideration to\neveryone\u2019s desires formed under such under unjust conditions is\nhardly sufficient to meet requirements of justice. This illustrates\nsome of the reasons for a \u201cthick\u201d as opposed to a\n\u201cthin\u201d veil of ignorance.\n4. Description of the Parties: Rationality and the Primary Social Goods\n\nRawls says that in the original position, \u201cthe Reasonable frames\nthe Rational\u201d (CP 319). He means the OP is a situation where\nrational choice of the parties is made subject to reasonable (or\nmoral) constraints. In what sense are the parties and their choice and\nagreement rational? Philosophers have different understandings of\npractical rationality. Rawls seeks to incorporate a relatively\nuncontroversial account of rationality into the original position, one\nthat he thinks most any account of practical rationality would endorse\nas at least necessary for rational decision. The parties are then\ndescribed as rational in a formal or \u201cthin\u201d sense that is\ncharacteristic of the theories of rational and social choice. They are\nresourceful, take effective means to their ends, and seek to make\ntheir preferences consistent. They also take the course of action that\nis more likely to achieve their ends (other things being equal). And\nthey choose courses of action that satisfy more rather than fewer of\ntheir purposes. Rawls calls these principles of rational choice the\n\u201ccounting principles\u201d (TJ \u00a7\u00a725, 63; JF 87).\n\nMore generally, for Rawls rational persons upon reflection can\nformulate a conception of their good, or of their primary\nvalues and purposes and the best way of life for themselves to live\ngiven their purposes. This conception incorporates their primary aims,\nambitions, and commitments to others, and is informed by the\nconscientious moral, religious, and philosophical convictions that\ngive meaning for them to their lives. Ideally, rational persons have\ncarefully thought about these things and their relative importance,\nand they can coherently order their purposes and commitments into a\n\u201crational plan of life,\u201d which extends over their\nlifetimes (TJ \u00a7\u00a763\u201364). For Rawls, rational persons\nregard life as a whole, and do not give preference to any particular\nperiod of it. Rather in drawing up their rational plans, they are\nequally concerned with their (future) good at each part of their\nlives. In this regard, rational persons are\nprudent\u2014they care for their future good, and while they\nmay discount the importance of future purposes based on probability\nassessments, they do not discount the achievement of their future\npurposes simply because they are in the future (TJ, \u00a745). (For a\ndifferent view, see Parfit, 1984)\n\nThese primary aims, convictions, ambitions, and commitments are among\nthe primary motivations of the parties in the original position. The\nparties want to provide favorable conditions for the pursuit of the\nvarious elements of the rational plan of life that defines a good life\nfor them. This is ultimately what the parties are trying to accomplish\nin their choice of principles of justice. In this sense they are\nrational.\n\nRawls says the parties in the original position are \u201cmutually\ndisinterested,\u201d in the sense that \u201cthey take no interest\nin each other\u2019s interests\u201d (TJ 110/[omitted in rev. ed.]).\nThis does not mean that they are self-interested or selfish persons,\nindifferent to the welfare of others. The interests advanced by the\nparties\u2019 life plans, Rawls says, \u201care not assumed to be\ninterests in the self, they are interests of a self that regards its\nconception of the good as worthy of satisfaction\u2026\u201d (TJ\n127/110) Most people are concerned, not just with their own happiness\nor welfare, but with others as well, and have all kinds of\ncommitments, including other-regarding, beneficent, and moral\npurposes, that are part of their conceptions of the good. But in the\noriginal position itself the parties are not altruistically motivated\nto benefit each other, in their capacity as contracting\nparties. They try to do as best as they can for themselves and\nfor those persons and causes that they care for. Their situation is\ncomparable, Rawls says, to that of \u201ctrustees or\nguardians\u201d acting to promote the interests of the beneficiaries\nthey represent. (JF, 84\u201385) Trustees cannot sacrifice the\nwell-being of the beneficiary they represent to benefit other trustees\nor individuals. If they did, they would be derelict in their duties.\nIt is perhaps to address the common criticism that the parties to the\noriginal position are self-interested that Rawls in the revised\nedition (TJ 110 rev.) omitted the phrase from the 1st\nedition, cited above, that \u201cthe parties take no interest in each\nother\u2019s interest.\u201d Moreover in later writings increasingly\nhe says that we should imagine that the parties are\n\u201crepresentatives\u201d of free and equal citizens and their\ninterests and \u201cact as guardians or trustees,\u201d seeking to\ndo as best as they can for the particular individuals that each\ntrustee represents. (PL \u00a74, JF\u00a724) In either case, Rawls\nbelieves this account of the parties\u2019 motivations promotes\ngreater clarity, and that to attribute to the parties moral\nmotivations or benevolence towards each other would not result in\ndefinite choice of a conception of justice (TJ,\n148\u20139/128\u20139; 584/512). (For example, how much benevolence\nshould the parties have towards one another or towards people in\ngeneral? Surely not impartial benevolence towards everyone, for then\nwe might as well dispense with the social contract and rely on a\ndisinterested impartial spectator point of view. It is one of the\n\u201ccircumstances of justice\u201d that people have different and\nconflicting values, and they value their own purposes and special\ncommitments to others more than they value others\u2019 purposes and\nspecial commitments, This is a good thing, not to be discouraged or\nundermined by justice, but rather regulated by it, since special\nobligations and commitments to specific others give meaning to\npeople\u2019s lives. (cf. Scheffler, 2001, chs.3, 4, 6) But if not\nequal concern for other parties and/or persons including themselves\n(and perhaps other animals), then how much care and concern should the\nparties in the original position exhibit towards others generally, as\ncompared with concern for themselves and their own good? (Half as much\nconcern for others\u2019 good as for their own? One-fifth as much?\nThere is no clear answer.) Rawls\u2019s thought is that, so far as\njustice is concerned, fair regard for others\u2019 interests is best\nrepresented by each party\u2019s rational choice behind a thick veil\nof ignorance; for each party has to be equally concerned with the\nconsequences of their choice of principles for each position in\nsociety, since they could end up in that same position.\n\nMutual disinterest of the parties also means they are not moved by\nenvy or rancor towards each other or others generally. This implies\nthat the parties do not strive to be wealthier or better off than\nothers for its own sake, and thus do not sacrifice advantages to\nprevent others from having more than they do. Instead, each party in\nthe original position is motivated to do as well as they can in\npromoting the optimal achievement of the many purposes that constitute\ntheir rational conception of the good, without regard to how much or\nhow little others may have. For this reason they strive to guarantee\nthemselves a share of primary social goods that is at least sufficient\nto enable them each to effectively pursue their (unknown) conception\nof the good.\n\nAnother feature of the parties is that they represent not just\nthemselves, but also family lines, including their descendants, or at\nleast their own children. This assumption is needed, Rawls says, to\ninclude representation of \u201cthe interests of all,\u201d\nincluding children and future generations. In the first edition of\nTheory Rawls says. \u201cFor example, we may think of the\nparties as heads of families and therefore as having a desire to\nfurther the welfare of their nearest descendants\u201d (Rawls 1971,\n128). Because of criticisms of the heads of families assumption, (by\nEnglish, 1977 and others) Rawls said in the revised edition that the\nproblem of future generations can be addressed by the parties assuming\nthat all preceding generations have followed the same principles that\nthe parties choose to apply to future generations. (Rawls 1999a, 111\nrev.). The \u201cheads of families\u201d assumption is discussed\nfurther in connection with feminist criticisms of Rawls in the\nsupplementary section:\n\nA Liberal Feminist Critique of the Original Position and Justice within the Family\n\n\nin the supplementary document\n Further Topics on the Original Position.\n\nThough the parties are not motivated by beneficence or even a concern\nfor justice, still they have a moral capacity for\nreasonableness and a sense of justice (TJ, 145/125\nrev.). Rawls distinguishes between the requirements of rationality and\nreasonableness; both are part of practical reasoning about what we\nought to do (JF 6\u20137; 81\u20132). The concept of \u201cthe\nRational\u201d concerns a person\u2019s good\u2014hence\nRawls refers to his account of the good as \u201cgoodness as\nrationality.\u201d A person\u2019s good for Rawls is the rational\nplan of life they would choose under hypothetical conditions of\n\u201cdeliberative rationality,\u201d where there is full knowledge\nof one\u2019s circumstances, capacities, and interests, as well as\nknowledge of the likelihood of succeeding at alternative life plans\none may be drawn to (TJ, \u00a764). \u201cThe Reasonable\u201d on\nthe other hand addresses the concept and principles of right,\nincluding individual moral duties and obligations as well as moral\nrequirements of right and justice that apply to institutions and\nsociety. Both rationality and reasonableness are independent aspects\nof practical reason for Rawls. They are independent in that Rawls,\nunlike Hobbes and other interest-based social contract views, does not\nregard justice and the reasonable as simply principles of prudence\nthat are beneficial for a person to comply with in order to\nsuccessfully pursue their purposes in social contexts. (Cf. Gauthier,\n1984) Unlike Hobbes, Rawls does not argue that an immoral or unjust\nperson is irrational, or that morality is necessarily required by\nrationality in the narrow sense of maximizing individual utility or\ntaking effective means to realize one\u2019s purposes.  But\nrational persons who violate demands of justice are unreasonable in so\nfar as they infringe upon moral principles and requirements of\npractical reasoning. Being reasonable, even if not required by\nrationality, is still an independent aspect of practical reason. Rawls\nresembles Kant in this regard (PL 25n); his distinction between the\nreasonable and rational parallels Kant\u2019s distinction between\ncategorical and hypothetical imperatives.\n\nEssential to being reasonable is having a sense of justice\nwith the capacities to understand and reason about and act upon what\njustice requires. The sense of justice is a normally effective desire\nto comply with duties and obligations required by justice; it includes\na willingness to cooperate with others on terms that are fair and that\nreasonable persons can accept and endorse. Rawls sees a sense of\njustice as an attribute people normally have; it \u201cwould appear\nto be a condition for human sociability\u201d (TJ, 495/433 rev.). He\nrejects the idea that people are motivated only by\nself-interest in all that they do; he also rejects the Hobbesian\nassumption that a willingness to do justice must be grounded in\nenlightened self-interest. It is essential to Rawls\u2019s argument\nfor the feasibility and stability of justice as fairness that the\nparties upon entering society have an effective sense of justice, and\nthat they are capable of doing what justice requires of them for its\nown sake, or at least because they believe this is what morality\nrequires of them. An amoralist, Rawls believes, is largely a\nphilosophical construct; amoralists who actually exist Rawls regards\nas sociopaths. \u201cA capacity for a sense of justice \u2026 would\nappear to be a condition of sociability\u201d (TJ 495/433).\n\nSubsequent to A Theory of Justice, beginning in\n\u2018Kantian Constructivism in Moral Theory,\u2019 (1980) (CP\n303ff.) Rawls says that the parties to the original position have a\n\u201chighest-order interest\u201d in the development and full and\ninformed exercise of their two \u201cmoral powers\u201d: their\ncapacity for a sense of justice as well as in their capacity for a\nrational conception of the good. Fulfilling these interests in the\nmoral powers is one of the main aims behind their agreement on\nprinciples of justice. Subsequently in Political Liberalism\n(1993) Rawls changed this to the parties\u2019 \u201chigher order\ninterests\u201d in development and exercise of the two moral powers\n(to avoid giving the appearance that the moral powers were final ends\nfor free and equal moral persons, as was argued in TJ). The\nparties\u2019 interest in developing these two moral powers is a\nsubstantive feature of Rawls\u2019s account of the rationality of\nfree and equal persons in the original position itself. (In this\nregard, his account of goodness as rationality is not as\n\u201cthin\u201d as in social theory; cf. TJ 143/124 rev.) Here\nRawls is still not attributing specifically moral motives\u2014a\ndesire to be reasonable and do what is right and just for their own\nsake\u2014to the parties in the original position. The idea\nbehind the parties\u2019 rationality in cultivating their sense of\njustice is that, since being reasonable and exercising one\u2019s\nsense of justice by complying with fair terms is a condition of human\nsociability and social cooperation, then it is in people\u2019s\nrational interest\u2014part of their good\u2014that they\nnormally develop their capacities for justice under social conditions.\nOtherwise they will not be in a position to cooperate with others and\nbenefit from social life. A person who is without a sense of justice\nis wholly unreasonable and as a result is normally eschewed by others,\nfor they are not trustworthy or reliable or even safe to interact\nwith. Since having a sense of justice is a condition of taking part in\nsocial cooperation, the parties have a \u201chigher-order\ninterest\u201d in establishing conditions for the development and\nfull exercise of their capacity for a sense of justice. The\nparties\u2019 interest in developing their capacity for a sense of\njustice is then a rational interest in being reasonable; justice is\nthen regarded by the parties as instrumental to their\nrealizing their conception of the good. (Here again, it is important\nto distinguish the purely rational motivation of the parties or their\ntrustees in the original position from that of free and equal citizens\nin a well-ordered society, who are normally morally motivated by their\nsense of justice to do what is right and just for its own sake.)\n\nThree factors then play a role in motivating the parties in the\noriginal position: (1) First, they aim to advance their determinate\nconception of the good, or rational plan of life, even though they do\nnot know what that conception is. Moreover, they also seek conditions\nthat enable them to exercise and develop their \u201cmoral\npowers,\u201d namely (2) their rational capacities to form, revise\nand rationally pursue a conception of their good, and (3) their\ncapacity to be reasonable and to have an effective sense of justice.\nThese are the three \u201chigher-order interests\u201d the parties\nto Rawls\u2019s original position aim to promote in their agreement\non principles of justice.\n\nThe three higher-order interests provide the basis for Rawls\u2019s\naccount of primary social goods. (TJ \u00a715, PL\n178\u2013190) The primary goods are the all-purpose social means that\nare necessary to the exercise and development of the moral powers and\nto pursue a wide variety of conceptions of the good. Rawls describes\nthem initially in Theory as goods that any rational person\nshould want, whatever their rational plan of life. The primary social\ngoods are basically: rights and liberties; powers and diverse\nopportunities; income and wealth; and the social bases of\nself-respect. \u2018Powers\u2019 refer not (simply) to a capacity to\neffect outcomes or influence others\u2019 behavior. Rawls rather uses\nthe term \u2018powers\u2019 to refer to the legal and other\ninstitutional abilities and prerogatives that attend offices and\nsocial position. Hence, he sometimes refers to the primary goods of\n\u201cpowers and prerogatives of offices and positions of authority\nand responsibility\u201d (JF 58). Members of various professions and\ntrades have institutional powers and prerogatives that are\ncharacteristic of their position and which are necessary if they are\nto carry out their respective roles and responsibilities. By income\nand wealth Rawls says he intends \u201call-purpose means\u201d that\nhave an exchange value, which are generally needed to achieve a wide\nrange of ends (JF 58\u201359). Finally, \u201cthe social bases of\nself-respect\u201d are features of institutions that are needed to\nenable people to have the confidence that they and their position in\nsociety are respected and that their conception of the good is worth\npursuing and achievable by themselves. These features depend upon\nhistory and culture. Primary among these social bases of self respect\nin a democratic society, Rawls will contend, are equal recognition of\npersons as citizens, and hence the institutional conditions needed for\nequal citizenship, including equality of basic rights and liberties\nwith equal political rights; fair equality of opportunities; and\npersonal independence guaranteed by adequate material means for\nachieving it. The social bases of self-respect are crucial to\nRawls\u2019s argument for equal basic liberties, especially\npolitical equality and equal rights of political participation.\n\nThe parties to the original position are motivated to achieve a fully\nadequate share of primary goods so they can achieve their higher-order\ninterests in pursuing their rational plans of life and exercising\ntheir moral powers. \u201cThey assume that they normally prefer more\nprimary social goods rather than less\u201d (TJ, 142/123 rev.). This\ntoo is part of being rational. Because they are not envious, their\nconcern is with the absolute level of primary goods, not their share\nrelative to other persons.\n\nTo sum up, the parties in the original position are formally rational\nin that they are assumed to have and to effectively pursue a rational\nplan of life with a schedule of coherent purposes and commitments that\nthey find valuable and give their lives meaning. As part of their\nrational plans, they have a substantive interest in the adequate\ndevelopment and full exercise of their capacities to be rational and\nto be reasonable. These \u201chigher-order interests\u201d together\nwith their rational life plans provide them with sufficient reason to\nprocure for themselves in their choice of principles of justice an\nadequate share of the primary social goods that enable them to achieve\nthese higher-order ends and effectively pursue their conceptions of\nthe good.\n\nA final feature of Rawls\u2019s account of rationality is a normal\nhuman tendency he calls \u201cthe Aristotelian principle\u201d (TJ\nsect.65). This \u201cdeep psychological fact\u201d says that, other\nthings being equal, people normally find activities that call upon the\nexercise of their developed capacities to be more interesting and\npreferable to engaging in simpler tasks, and their enjoyment increases\nthe more the capacity is developed and realized and the greater the\ncomplexity of activities (TJ, 426/374). Humans enjoy doing something\nas they become more proficient at it, and of two activities they\nperform equally well, they normally prefer the one that calls upon a\nlarger repertoire of more intricate and subtler discriminations.\nRawls\u2019s examples: someone who does both activities well\ngenerally prefers playing chess to checkers, and studying algebra to\narithmetic. (TJ 426/374) Moreover Rawls, citing J.S. Mill believes\nthat development at least some of our \u201chigher capacities\u201d\n(Mill\u2019s term) is normally important to our sense of\nself-respect. These general facts imply that rational people should\nincorporate into their life plans activities that call upon the\nexercise and development of their talents and skills and distinctly\nhuman capacities (TJ 432/379). This motivation becomes especially\nrelevant to Rawls\u2019s argument for the stability of justice as\nfairness, the good of social union, and the good of justice (TJ\n\u00a779, \u00a786; see below, \u00a75.3). The important point here is\nthat the Aristotelian principle is taken into account by the parties\nin their decision on principles of justice. They want to choose\nprinciples that maintain their sense of self-respect and enable them\nto freely develop their human capacities and pursue a wide range of\nactivities, as well as engage their capacities for a sense of\njustice.\n5. Other Conditions on Choice in the Original Position\n\nThe veil of ignorance is the primary moral constraint upon the\nrational choice of the parties in the original position. There are\nseveral other conditions imposed on their agreement.\n5.1 The Circumstances of Justice (TJ \u00a722)\n\nAmong the general facts the parties know are \u201cthe circumstances\nof justice.\u201d Rawls says these are \u201cconditions under which\nhuman cooperation is both possible and necessary\u201d (TJ 126/109\nrev.). Following Hume, Rawls distinguishes two general kinds: the\nobjective and subjective circumstances of justice. The former include\nphysical facts about human beings, such as their rough similarity in\nmental and physical faculties, and vulnerability to the united force\nof others. Objective circumstances also include conditions of moderate\nscarcity of resources: there are not enough resources to satisfy\neveryone\u2019s desires, but there are enough to provide all with\nadequate satisfaction of their basic needs; unlike conditions of\nextreme scarcity (e.g. famine), cooperation then seems productive and\nworthwhile for people.\n\nAmong the subjective circumstances of justice are the parties\u2019\nmutual disinterestedness, which reflects the \u201climited\naltruism\u201d (TJ 146/127) of persons in society.. Free and equal\npersons have their own plans of life and special commitments to\nothers, as well as different philosophical and religious beliefs and\nmoral doctrines (TJ 127/110). Hume says that if humans were\nimpartially benevolent, equally concerned with everyone\u2019s\nwelfare, then justice would be unnecessary. People then would\nwillingly sacrifice their interests for the greater advantage of\nother. They would not be concerned about their personal rights or\npossessions, and property would be unnecessary (Hume 1777 [1970,\n185\u2013186]). But we are more concerned with our own aims and\ninterests\u2014which include our interests in the interests of those\nnearer and dearer to us\u2014than we are with the interests of\nstrangers with whom we have few if any interactions. This implies a\npotential conflict of human interests. Rawls adds that concern for our\ninterests and plans of life does not mean we are selfish or have\ninterests only in ourselves\u2014again, interests of a self\nshould not be confused with interests in oneself; we have\ninterests in others and in all kinds of causes, ends, and commitments\nto other persons (TJ 127/110). But, as history shows, our benevolent\ninterests in others and in religious and philosophical doctrines are\nat least as often the cause of social and international conflict as is\nself-interest.\n\nThe subjective circumstances of justice also include limitations on\nhuman knowledge, thought, and judgment, as well as emotional\ninfluences and great diversity of experiences. These lead to biases\nand inevitable disagreements in factual and other judgments, as well\nas to differences in religious, philosophical, and moral convictions.\nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls highlights these subjective\ncircumstances, calling them \u201cthe burdens of judgment\u201d (PL\n54\u201358). They imply, significantly, that regardless how impartial\nand altruistic people are, they still will disagree in their factual\njudgments and in religious, philosophical and moral doctrines.\nDisagreements in these matters are inevitable even among fully\nrational and reasonable people. This is \u201cthe fact of reasonable\npluralism\u201d (PL 36), which is another general fact known to the\nparties in the original position. Reasonable pluralism of doctrines\nlends significant support to Rawls\u2019s arguments for the first\nprinciple of justice, especially to equal basic liberties of\nconscience, expression, and association.\n5.2 Publicity and other Formal Constraints of Right (TJ \u00a723)\n\nThere are five \u201cformal constraints\u201d associated with the\nconcept of right that Rawls says the parties must take into account in\ncoming to agreement on principles of justice. The more a conception of\njustice satisfies these formal constraints of right, the more reason\nthe parties have to choose that conception. The formal constraints of\nright are: generality, universality in application, ordering of\nconflicting claims, publicity, and finality. The ordering\ncondition says that a conception of justice should aspire to\ncompleteness: it should be able to resolve conflicting claims and\norder their priority. Ordering implies a systematicity requirement:\nprinciples of justice should provide a determinate resolution to\nproblems of justice that arise under them; and to the degree that a\nconception of justice is not able to order conflicting claims and\nresolve problems of justice, that gives greater reason against\nchoosing it in the original position compared with those that do. The\nordering condition is important in Rawls\u2019s argument against\npluralist moral doctrines he calls \u201cIntuitionism.\u201d\n\nSidgwick attaches a great deal of importance to the ordering\ncondition, and contends that \u201cUniversal Hedonism\u201d is the\nonly reasonable moral doctrine that can satisfy it (Sidgwick 1907\n[1981], 406). Rawls would have to concede that justice as fairness\ndoes not possess, at least theoretically, the same degree of\nsystematic ordering of claims as does hedonistic utilitarianism which\nhas cardinal measures of utility. For example, Rawls\u2019s priority\nprinciples can resolve conflicting claims regarding the priority of\nbasic liberties over fair equality of opportunity, fair opportunity\nover the difference principle, the difference principle over the\nprinciple of efficiency and the general welfare, as well as many\ndisputes arising within the difference principle itself regarding\nmeasures that maximally promote the position of the least advantaged.\nBut there is no priority principle or algorithm to resolve many\nconflicts between basic liberties themselves (e.g. conflicts between\nfreedom of speech vs. rights of security and integrity of persons in\nhate speech cases; or the conflict between free speech and the fair\nvalue of equal political liberties in restrictions on campaign finance\ncontributions). Often in such conflicts we have to weigh competing\nconsiderations and come to a decision about where the greater balance\nof reasons lies, much like intuitionist views. (See Hart, 1973). Rawls\nin \u2018Basic Liberties and their Priority,\u2019 1980, PL ch.VIII,\naddresses this problem to some degree with the idea of the\nsignificance of a basic liberty to the development and full and\ninformed exercise of the moral powers.) The lack of a priority or\nalgorithmic ordering principle does not mean the balance of reasons in\nsuch conflicts regarding basic liberties is indeterminate but rather\nthat reasonable individuals will often disagree, and that final\ndecisions practically will have to be made through the appropriate\ndemocratic, judicial, or other procedures (which of course can be\nmistaken). But for Rawls a moral conception\u2019s capacity to\nclearly order conflicting claims is not dispositive, but one among\nseveral formal and substantive moral conditions that a conception of\njustice should satisfy (ultimately in reflective equilibrium).\n\nThe publicity condition says that the parties are to\nassume that the principles of justice they choose will be publicly\nknown to members of society and recognized by them as the bases\nfor their social cooperation. This implies that people will not be\nuninformed, manipulated, or otherwise have false beliefs about the\nbases of their social and political relations. There are to be no\n\u201cnoble lies\u201d, false ideologies, or \u201cfake news\u201d\nobscuring a society\u2019s principles of justice and the moral bases\nfor its basic social institutions. The publicity of principles of\njustice is ultimately for Rawls a condition of respect for persons as\nfree and equal moral persons. Rawls believes that individuals in a\ndemocratic society should know the bases of their social and political\nrelations and not have to be deceived about them in order to cooperate\nand live together peacably and on fair terms. Publicity plays an\nimportant role in Rawls\u2019s arguments against utilitarianism and\nother consequentialist conceptions. The idea of publicity is further\ndeveloped in Political Liberalism through the ideas of public\njustification and the role of public reason in political\ndeliberation.\n\nRelated to publicity is that principles should be universal in\napplication. This implies not simply that \u201cthey hold for\neveryone in virtue of their being moral persons\u201d (TJ 132/114\nrev.). It also means that everyone can understand the principles of\njustice and use them in their deliberations about justice and its\nrequirements. Universality in application then imposes a limit on how\ncomplex principles of justice can be\u2014they must be understandable\nto common moral sense, and not so complicated that only experts can\napply them in deliberations. For among other things, these principles\nare to guide democratic citizens in their judgments and shared\ndeliberations about just laws and policies.\n\nBoth publicity and universality in application (as Rawls defines it)\nare controversial conditions. Utilitarians, for example, have argued\nthat the truth about morality and justice is so complicated and\ncontroversial that it might be necessary to keep fundamental moral\nprinciples (the principle of utility) hidden from most\nindividuals\u2019 awareness. For morality and justice often require\nmuch that is contrary to peoples\u2019 beliefs and personal\ninterests. Also sometimes it\u2019s just too complicated for people\nto understand the reasons for their moral duties. So long as they\nunderstand their individual duties, it may be better if they do not\nunderstand the principles and reasons behind them. So Sidgwick argues\nthat the aims of utilitarianism might better be achieved if it remains\nan \u201cesoteric morality,\u201d knowledge of which is confined to\n\u201can enlightened few\u201d (Sidgwick 1907 [1981], 489\u201390).\nThe reason Rawls sees publicity and universality as necessary relates\nto the conception of the person implicit in justice as fairness. If we\nconceive of persons as free and equal moral persons capable of\npolitical and moral autonomy, then they should not be under any\nillusions about the bases of their social relations, but should be\nable to understand, accept, and apply these principles in their\ndeliberations about justice. These are important conditions Rawls\ncontends for the freedom, equality, and autonomy (moral and political)\nof democratic citizens.\n\nFinally, the generality condition is straightforward in that\nit requires that principles of justice not contain any proper names or\nrigged definite descriptions, which Rawls says rules out free-rider\nand other forms of egoism together with the ordering condition. The\nfinality condition says that moral principles of justice\nprovide conclusive reasons for action, providing \u201cthe final\ncourt of appeal in practical reasoning.\u201d They override demands\nof law and custom, social rules, and reasons of personal prudence and\nself-interest. (TJ 135\u201336/116\u201317). Finality is one of\nseveral Kantian conditions Rawls imposes that have been questioned by\ncritics on grounds that it underestimates inevitable and sometimes\nirresolvable conflicts of moral reasons with other values. For\nexample, should reasons of justice always be given priority\nover special obligations owed to specific persons or associations?\nShould moral reasons always be given priority over reasons of love,\nprudence, or even self-interest? (See Williams 1981, chs.1, 5; Wolf,\n2014, chs.2, 3, 9)\n5.3 The Stability Requirement\n\nRawls says, \u201cAn important feature of a conception of justice is\nthat it should generate its own support. Its principles should be such\nthat when they are embodied in the basic structure of society, people\ntend to acquire the corresponding sense of justice and develop a\ndesire to act in accordance with its principles. In this case a\nconception of justice is stable\u201d (TJ, 138/119). The parties in\nthe original position are to take into account the \u201crelative\nstability\u201d of a conception of justice and the society that\ninstitutes it. The stability of a just society does not mean that it\nmust be unchanging. It means rather that in the face of inevitable\nchange members of a society should be able to maintain their\nallegiance to principles of justice and the institutions they support.\nWhen disruptions to society do occur (via economic crises, war,\nnatural catastrophes, etc.) and/or society departs from justice,\ncitizens\u2019 commitments to principles of justice are sufficiently\nrobust that just institutions are eventually restored. The role of the\nstability requirement for Rawls is twofold: first, to test whether\npotential principles of justice are compatible with human natural\npropensities, or our moral psychology and general facts about social\nand economic institutions; and second, to determine whether acting on\nand from principles of justice are conducive and even essential to\nrealizing the human good.\n\nTo be stable principles of justice should be realizable in a\nfeasible and enduring social world, the ideal of which Rawls\ncalls a \u201cwell-ordered society.\u201d (See below, \u00a76.3.)\nThey need to be practicably possible given the limitations of the\nhuman condition. Moreover, this feasible social world must be one that\ncan endure over time, not by just any means, but by gaining the\nwilling support of people who live in it. People should knowingly want\nto uphold and maintain society\u2019s just institutions not just\nbecause they benefit from them, but on grounds of their sense of\njustice. In choosing principles of justice, the parties in the\noriginal position must take into account their \u201crelative\nstability\u201d (TJ \u00a776). They have to consider the degree to\nwhich a conception (in comparison with other conceptions) describes an\nachievable and sustainable system of social cooperation, and whether\nthe institutions and demands of such a society will attract\npeople\u2019s willing compliance and generally engage their sense of\njustice.\n\nFor example, suppose principles of justice were to impose a duty to\npractice impartial benevolence towards all people, and thus a duty to\nshow no greater concern for the welfare of ourselves and loved ones\nthan we do towards billions of others. This principle demands too much\nof human nature and would not be sustainable or even\nfeasible\u2014people simply would reject its onerous demands. But\nRawls\u2019s stability requirement implies more than just\n\u2018ought implies can.\u2019 It says that principles of justice\nand the scheme of social cooperation they describe should evince\n\u201cstability for the right reasons\u201d ((as Rawls later says in\nPL xli, 143f., 459f.,). Recall here the higher-order interests of the\nparties in development and exercise of their capacities for justice. A\njust society should be able to endure not simply as a modus\nvivendi, or compromise among conflicting interests; nor simply\nendure by promoting the majority of peoples\u2019 interests and/or\ncoercive enforcement of its provisions. Stability \u201cfor the right\nreasons,\u201d as conceived in Theory, requires that people\nsupport society for moral reasons of justice. Society\u2019s\nbasic principles must respond to reasonable persons\u2019 capacities\nfor justice and engage their sense of justice. Rawls regards our moral\ncapacities for justice as an integral part of our nature as sociable\nbeings. He believes that one role of a conception of justice is to\naccommodate human capacities for sociability, the capacities for\njustice that enable us to be cooperative social beings. So not only\nshould a conception of justice advance human interests, but it should\nalso answer to our moral psychology by enabling us to knowingly and\nwillingly exercise our moral capacities and sensibilities, which are\namong the moral powers to be reasonable. This is one way that\nRawls\u2019s conception of justice is \u201cideal-based\u201d (CP\n400\u2013401 n.): it is based in an ideal of human beings as free and\nequal moral persons and an ideal of their social relations as\ngenerally acceptable and justifiable to all reasonable persons\nwhatever their circumstances (the ideal of a well-ordered\nsociety).\n\nThis relates to the second ground for the stability condition, which\ncan only be mentioned here: it is that the correct principles of\njustice should be compatible with, and even integral to realizing the\nhuman good. It speaks strongly in favor of a conception of\njustice that it is compatible with and promotes the human good. First,\nif a conception of justice requires of many reasonable people that\nthey change their conscientious philosophical or religious convictions\nfor the sake of satisfying a majority\u2019s beliefs, or abandon\ntheir pursuit of the important interests that constitute their plan of\nlife, this conception could not gain their willing support and would\nnot be stable over sustained periods of time. Moreover, Rawls contends\nthat a conception of justice should enable citizens to fully exercise\nand adequately develop their moral powers, including their capacities\nfor justice. It must then engage their sense of justice in such a way\nthat they do not regard justice as a burden but should come to\nexperience that acting on and from principles of justice is worth\ndoing for its own sake. For Rawls, it speaks strongly in favor of a\nconception of justice that acting for the sake of its principles is\nexperienced as an activity that is good in itself (as Rawls contends\nin Theory of Justice); or at least that willing compliance\nwith requirements of justice is an essential part of the reasonable\ncomprehensive philosophical, religious, or moral doctrines that\nreasonable persons affirm (as Rawls contends later in Political\nLiberalism). For then justice and the full and informed exercise\nof the sense of justice are for reasonable and rational persons\nessential goods, preconditions for their living a good life, as that\nis defined by their rational conception of the good.\n6. The Arguments for the Principles of Justice from the Original Position\n\nThe original position is not a bargaining situation where the parties\nmake proposals and counterproposals and negotiate over different\nprinciples of justice. Nor is it a wide ranging discussion where the\nparties debate, deliberate, and design their own conception of justice\n(unlike, for example, Habermas\u2019s discourse ethics; see Habermas,\n1995). Instead, the parties\u2019 deliberations are much more\nconstrained and regulated. They are presented with a list of\nconceptions of justice taken from the tradition of western political\nphilosophy. These include different versions of utilitarianism,\nperfectionism, and intuitionism (or pluralist views), rational egoism,\njustice as fairness, and a group of \u201cmixed conceptions\u201d\nthat combine elements of these. (For Rawls\u2019s initial list see TJ\n124/107) Rawls later says libertarian entitlement principles should\nalso be added to the list, and contends the principles of justice are\nstill preferable. (JF 83). (Nozick agrees and says the OP is incapable\nof yielding historical entitlement principles, but only patterned\nend-state principles instead. Nozick 1974, 198\u2013204. Rawls\nreplies that the difference principle does not conform to any\nobservable pattern but grounds fair distributions in a fair social\nprocess that must actually be carried out. PL, 282\u201383)\n\nThe parties\u2019 deliberations are confined to discussing and\nagreeing upon the conception that each finds most rational, given\ntheir specified interests. In a series of pairwise comparisons, they\nconsider all the conceptions of justice made available to them and\nultimately agree unanimously to accept the conception that survives\nthis winnowing process. In this regard, the original position is best\nseen as a kind of selection process wherein the parties\u2019\ndeliberations are constrained by the background conditions imposed by\nthe original position as well as the list of conceptions of justice\nprovided to them. They are assigned the task of agreeing on principles\nfor designing the basic structure of a self-contained society under\nthe circumstances of justice.\n\nIn making their decision, the parties are motivated only by their own\nrational interests. They do not take moral considerations of justice\ninto account except in so far as these considerations bear on their\nachieving their interests within society. Their interests again are\ndefined in terms of their each acquiring an adequate share of primary\nsocial goods (rights and liberties, powers and opportunities, income\nand wealth, etc.) and achieving the background social conditions\nenabling them to effectively pursue their conception of the good and\nrealize their higher-order interests in developing and exercising\ntheir moral powers. Since the parties are ignorant of their particular\nconceptions of the good and of all other particular facts about their\nsociety, they are not in a position to engage in bargaining. In effect\nthey all have the same general information and are motivated by the\nsame interests.\n\nRawls makes four arguments in Theory, Part I for the\nprinciples of justice. The main argument for the difference principle\nis made later in TJ \u00a749, and is amended and clarified in\nJustice as Fairness: A Restatement. The common theme\nthroughout the original position arguments is that it is more rational\nfor the parties to choose the principles of justice over any other\nalternative. Rawls devotes most of his attention to the comparison of\njustice as fairness with classical and average utilitarianism, with\nbriefer discussions of perfectionism (TJ, \u00a750) and intuitionism\n(TJ 278\u201381) Here I\u2019ll focus discussion primarily on\nRawls\u2019s comparison between justice as fairness and\nutilitarianism.\n6.1 The Principles of Justice\n\nBefore turning to Rawls\u2019s arguments from the original position,\nit is helpful to have available the principles of justice and other\nprinciples that constitute Justice as Fairness.\n\nFirst Principle: \u201cEach person has an equal right to the\nmost extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a\nsimilar system of liberty for all.\u201d (TJ 266)\n\nThe first principle was revised in 1982 to say \u201cEach person has\nan equal right to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties\n\u2026\u201d (PL, 291) replacing \u201c\u2026 the most extensive\nscheme of equal basic liberties.\u201d) Notably, Rawls also\nintroduces in Political Liberalism, almost in passing, a\nprinciple of basic needs that precedes the first principle and\nrequires that citizens\u2019 basic needs be met at least to the\nextent that they can understand and fruitfully exercise their basic\nrights and liberties. (PL 7; JF 79n.) This social minimum is also said\nin Political Liberalism to be a \u201cconstitutional\nessential\u201d for any reasonable liberal conception of justice. (PL\n166, 228ff.; JF 47, n.7)\n\nThe basic rights and liberties protected by the first principle are\nspecified by a list (see TJ 53f., PL 291): liberty of conscience and\nfreedom of association, (TJ \u00a7\u00a733\u20134); freedom of\nthought and freedom of speech and expression (PL, pp.340\u2013363);\nthe integrity and freedom of the person and the right to hold personal\nproperty; equal rights of political participation and their fair value\n(TJ \u00a7\u00a736\u201337); and the rights and liberties protected\nby the rule of law (due process, freedom from arbitrary arrest, etc.\nTJ \u00a738). (Rawls says the right to ownership of means of\nproduction and laissez faire freedom of contract are not included\namong the basic liberties. TJ, 54 rev. Also freedom of movement and\nfree choice of occupation are said to be primary goods protected by\nfair equality of opportunity principle. PL 76, JF 58f.))\n\nSecond Principle: \u201cSocial and economic inequalities are\nto satisfy two conditions. First they must attach to offices and\npositions open to all under conditions of fair equality of\nopportunity; and second they must be to the greatest advantage of the\nleast advantaged members of society [the difference principle]\u201d\nconsistent with the just savings principle. (PL 281, JF 42\u201343,\nTJ 301/266 rev.)\n\nJust Savings Principle: Each generation should save for\nfuture generations at a savings rate that they could rationally expect\npast generations to have saved for them. (TJ \u00a744; JF\n159\u2013160)\n\nPrinciples for individuals, include (a) the natural\nduties to uphold justice, mutual respect, mutual aid, and not to\ninjure or harm the innocent (TJ \u00a7\u00a719, 51); and (b) the\nprinciple of fairness, to do one\u2019s fair share in just or\nnearly just practices and institutions from which one accepts their\nbenefits, (which grounds the principle of fidelity, to keep\none\u2019s promises and commitments. (TJ \u00a7\u00a718, 52).\n\nThe Priority Principles: the principles of justice are ranked\nin lexical order. (a) The priority of liberty requires that basic\nliberties can only be restricted to strengthen the system of liberties\nshared by all. (b) Fair equality of opportunity is lexically prior to\nthe difference principle. (c) The second principle is prior to the\nprinciple of efficiency and maximizing the sum of advantages. (TJ\n302/266 rev.)\n\nThe General Conception of Justice: \u201cAll social\ngoods\u2014liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases\nof self-respect, are to be distributed equally unless an unequal\ndistribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the\nleast favored.\u201d TJ 1971, 302. Note: The general conception is\nthe difference principle generalized to all primary goods (TJ 1971,\n83); it applies in non-ideal conditions where the priority of liberty\nand opportunity is not sustainable.\n6.2 The Argument from the Maximin Criterion (TJ, \u00a7\u00a726\u201328)\n\nDescribing the parties\u2019 choice as a rational choice subject to\nthe reasonable constraints imposed by the original position allows\nRawls to invoke the theory of rational choice and decision under\nconditions of uncertainty. In rational choice theory there are a\nnumber of potential \u201cstrategies\u201d or rules of choice that\nare more or less reliably used depending on the circumstances. One\nrule of choice\u2014called \u201cmaximin\u201d\u2014directs that\nwe play it as safe as possible by choosing the alternative whose worst\noutcome leaves us better off than the worst outcome of all other\nalternatives. The aim is to \u201cmaximize the minimum\u201d regret\nor loss to one\u2019s position (measured in terms of welfare or, for\nRawls, one\u2019s share of primary social goods). To follow this\nstrategy, Rawls says you should choose as if your enemy were to assign\nyour social position in whatever kind of society you end up in. By\ncontrast another strategy leads us to focus on the most advantaged\nposition and says we should \u201cmaximize the maximum\u201d\npotential gain\u2014\u201cmaximax\u201d\u2014and choose the\nalternative whose best outcome leaves us better off than all other\nalternatives. Which, if either, of these strategies is more sensible\nto use depends on the circumstances and many other factors.\n\nA third strategy advocated by orthodox Bayesian decision theory, says\nwe should always choose to directly maximize expected\nutility. To do so under conditions of uncertainty of outcomes,\nthe degree of uncertainty should be factored into one\u2019s utility\nfunction, with probability estimates assigned to alternatives based on\nthe limited knowledge that one has. Given these subjective estimates\nof probability incorporated into one\u2019s utility function, one can\nalways choose the alternative that maximizes expected\nutility. Since it simplifies matters to apply the same rule of choice\nto all decisions this is a highly attractive idea, so long as one can\naccept that it is normally safe to assume that that the maximization\nof expected utility leads over time to maximizing\nactual utility.\n\nWhat about those extremely rare instances where there is absolutely\nno basis upon which to make probability estimates? Suppose\nyou don\u2019t even have a hunch regarding the greater likelihood of\none alternative over another. According to orthodox Bayesian decision\ntheory, the \u201cprinciple of insufficient reason\u201d should then\nbe observed; it says that when there is no reason to assign a greater\nlikelihood to one alternative rather than another, then an equal\nprobability is to be assigned to each potential outcome. This\nmakes sense on the assumption that if you have no more premonition of\nthe likelihood of one option rather than another, they are for all\nyou know equally likely to occur. By observing this rule of\nchoice consistently over time, a rational chooser presumably should\nmaximize expected individual utility, and hopefully actual utility as\nwell.\n\nWhat now is the appropriate decision rule to be used to choose\nprinciples of justice under conditions of complete uncertainty of\nprobabilities in Rawls\u2019s original position? Rawls argues that,\ngiven the enormous gravity of choice in the original position, plus\nthe fact that the choice is not repeatable (there\u2019s no\nopportunity to renegotiate or revise one\u2019s decision), it is\nrational for the parties to follow the maximin strategy when choosing\nbetween the principles of justice and principles of average or\naggregate utility (or any other principles that do not guarantee basic\nrights, liberties, opportunities, and a social minimum). Not\nsurprisingly, following the maximin rule of choice results in choice\nof the principles of justice over the principles of utility (average\nor aggregate); for unlike utilitarianism, justice as fairness\nguarantees equal basic liberties, fair equal opportunities, and an\nadequate social minimum for all citizens.\n\nWhy does Rawls think maximin is the rational choice rule? Recall what\nis at stake in choice from the original position. The decision is not\nan ordinary choice. It is rather a unique and irrevocable choice where\nthe parties decide the basic structure of their society, or the kind\nof social world they will live in and the background conditions\nagainst which they will develop and pursue their aims. It is a kind of\nsuperchoice\u2014an inimitable choice of the background conditions\nfor all one\u2019s future choices. Rawls argues that because of the\nunique importance of the choice in the original\nposition\u2014including the gravity of the choice, the fact that it\nis not renegotiable or repeatable, and the fact that it determines all\none\u2019s future prospects\u2014it is rational to follow the\nmaximin rule and choose the principles of justice. For should even the\nworst transpire, the principles of justice guarantee an adequate share\nof primary goods enabling one to maintain one\u2019s conscientious\nconvictions and sincerest affections and pursue a wide range of\npermissible ends by protecting equal basic liberties and fair equal\nopportunities and guaranteeing an adequate social minimum of income\nand wealth. The principles of utility, by contrast, provide no\nguarantee of any of these benefits.\n\nRawls says that in general there are three conditions that must be met\nin order to make it rational to follow the maximin rule (TJ\n154\u201355/134 rev.). First, there should be no basis or at most a\nvery insecure basis upon which to make estimates of probabilities.\nSecond, the choice singled out by observing the maximin rule is an\nacceptable alternative we can live with, so that one cares relatively\nlittle by comparison for what is to be gained above the minimum\nconditions secured by the maximin choice. When this condition is\nsatisfied, then no matter what position one eventually ends up in, it\nis at least acceptable. The third condition for applying the maximin\nrule is that all the other alternatives have worse outcomes that we\ncould not accept and live with. Of these three conditions Rawls later\nsays that the first plays a minor role, and that it is the second and\nthird conditions that are crucial to the maximin argument for justice\nas fairness (JF 99). This seems to suggest that, even if the veil of\nignorance were not as thick and parties did have some degree of\nknowledge of the likelihood of ending up in one social position rather\nthan another, still it would be more rational to choose the principles\nof justice over the principle of utility.\n\nRawls contends all three conditions for the maximin strategy are\nsatisfied in the original position when choice is made between the\nprinciples of justice and the principle of utility (average and\naggregate). Because all one\u2019s values, commitments, and future\nprospects are at stake in the original position, and there is no hope\nof renegotiating the outcome, a rational person would agree to the\nprinciples of justice instead of the principle of utility. For the\nprinciples of justice imply that no matter what position you occupy in\nsociety, you will have the rights and resources needed to maintain\nyour valued commitments and purposes, to effectively exercise your\ncapacities for rational and moral deliberation and action, and to\nmaintain your sense of self-respect as an equal citizen. With the\nprinciple of utility there is no such guarantee; everything is\n\u201cup for grabs\u201d (so to speak) and subject to loss if\nrequired by the greater sum of utilities. Conditions (2) and (3) for\napplying maximin are then satisfied in the comparison of justice as\nfairness with the principle of (average or aggregate) utility.\n\nIt is often claimed that Rawls\u2019s parties are\n\u201crisk-averse;\u201d otherwise they would never follow the\nmaximin rule but would take a chance on riskier but more rewarding\noutcomes provided by the principle of utility. Thus, John Harsanyi\ncontends that it is more rational under conditions of complete\nuncertainty always to choose according to the principle of\ninsufficient reason and assume an equal probability of occupying any\nposition in society. When the equiprobability assumption is made, the\nparties in the original position would choose the principle of average\nutility instead of the principles of justice (Harsanyi 1975).\n\nRawls denies that the parties have a psychological disposition to\nrisk-aversion. They have no knowledge of their attitudes towards risk.\nHe argues however that it is rational to choose as if one\nwere risk averse under the highly exceptional circumstances of the\noriginal position. His point is that, while there is nothing rational\nabout a fixed disposition to risk aversion, it is nonetheless rational\nin some circumstances to choose conservatively to protect certain\nfundamental interests against loss or compromise. It does not make one\na risk averse person, but instead it is normally rational to purchase\nauto liability, health, and home insurance against accident or\ncalamity (assuming it is affordable). The original position is such a\nsituation writ large. Even if one knew in the original position that\nthe citizen one represents enjoys gambling and taking great risks,\nthis would still not be a reason to gamble with their rights,\nliberties and starting position in society. For if the high risktaker\nwere born into a traditional, repressive, or fundamentalist society,\nthey might never have an opportunity for gambling and taking other\nrisks they normally enjoy. It is rational then even for high\nrisktakers to choose conservatively in the original position and\nguarantee their future opportunities to gamble or otherwise take\nrisks.\n\nHarsanyi and other orthodox Bayesians contend that maximin is an\nirrational decision rule, and they provide ample examples. To take\nRawls\u2019 own example, in a lottery where the loss and gain\nalternatives are either (0, n) or (1/n, 1) for all natural numbers n,\nmaximin says choose the latter alternative (1/n, 1). This is clearly\nirrational for almost any number n except very small numbers. (TJ 136\nrev.). But such examples do not suffice here; simply because maximin\nis under most circumstances irrational does not mean that it is\nnever rational. For example, suppose n>1 and you must have\n1/n to save you own life. Given the gravity of the circumstances, it\nwould be rational to choose conservatively since you are guaranteed\n1/n according to the maximin strategy, and there is no guarantee you\nwill survive if you choose according to the principle of insufficient\nreason.\n\nNo doubt maximin is an irrational strategy under most\ncircumstances of choice uncertainty, particularly under circumstances\nwhere we will have future opportunities to recoup our losses and\nchoose again. But these are not the circumstances of the original\nposition. Once the principles of justice are decided, they apply in\nperpetuity, and there is no opportunity to renegotiate or escape the\nsituation. One who relies on the equiprobability assumption in\nchoosing principles of justice in the original position is being\nfoolishly reckless given the gravity of choice at stake. It is not\nbeing risk-averse, but rather entirely rational to refuse to gamble\nwith one\u2019s basic liberties, fair equal opportunities and\nadequate resources needed to pursue one\u2019s most cherished ends\nand commitments, simply for the unknown chance of gaining the\nmarginally greater social powers, income and wealth that might be\navailable to some in a society governed entirely by the principle of\nutility.\n\nRawls exhibits the force of the maximin argument in discussing liberty\nof conscience. He says (TJ, sect. 33) that a person who is willing to\njeopardize their right to hold and practice their conscientious\nreligious, philosophical and moral convictions, all for the sake of\ngaining uncertain added benefits via the principle of utility, does\nnot know what it means to have conscientious beliefs, or at least does\nnot take such beliefs seriously (TJ 207\u201308/181\u201382 rev.). A\nrational person with convictions about what gives life meaning is not\nwilling to negotiate with and gamble away the right to hold and\nexpress those convictions and the freedom to act on them. After all\nwhat could be the basis for negotiation, for what could matter more\nthan the objects of one\u2019s most sincere convictions and\ncommitments? Some people (e.g. some nihilists) may not have\nany conscientious convictions (except the belief that nothing\nis worthwhile) and are simply willing to act on impulse or on whatever\nthoughts and desires they happen to have at the moment. But behind the\nveil of ignorance no one knows whether they are such a person, and it\nwould be foolish to make this assumption. Knowing general facts about\nhuman propensities and sociability, the parties must take into account\nthat people normally have conscientious convictions and values and\ncommitments they are unwilling to compromise. (Besides, even the\nnihilist should want to protect the freedom to be a nihilist, to avoid\nending up in an intolerant religious society.) Thus it remains\nirrational to jeopardize basic liberties by choosing the principle of\nutility instead of the principles of justice.\n\nNone of this is to say that maximin is normally a rational choice\nstrategy. Rawls himself says it \u201cis not, in general, a suitable\nguide for choices under uncertainty\u201d (TJ 153). It is not even a\nrational strategy in the original position when the alternatives for\nchoice guarantee basic liberties, equal opportunities, and a social\nminimum guaranteed by the principle of average utility \u2013 see the\ndiscussion in the supplementary section:\n\nThe Argument for the Difference Principle\n\n\nin the supplementary document\n The Argument for the Difference Principle and the Four Stage Sequence.\n\nRawls relies upon the maximin argument mainly to argue for the first\nprinciple of justice and fair equality of opportunity. Other arguments\nare needed to support his claim that justice requires the social\nminimum be determined by the difference principle.\n6.3 The Strains of Commitment\n\nThere are three additional arguments Rawls makes to support justice as\nfairness (all in TJ, sect. 29). Each of these depends upon the concept\nof a \u201cwell-ordered society.\u201d The parties in the original\nposition are to choose principles that are to govern a well-ordered\nsociety where everyone agrees, complies with, and wants to comply with\nits principles of justice. The ideal of a well-ordered\nsociety is Rawls\u2019s development of social contract doctrine.\nIt is a society in which (1) everyone knows and willingly accepts and\naffirms the same public principles of justice and everyone knows this;\n(2) these principles are successfully realized in basic social\ninstitutions, including laws and conventions, and are generally\ncomplied with by citizens; and (3) reasonable persons are morally\nmotivated to comply by their sense of justice \u2013 they want to do\nwhat justice requires of them (TJ 4\u20135, \u00a769). There are then\ntwo sides to Rawls\u2019s social contract. The parties in the\noriginal position have the task of agreeing to principles that all can\nrationally accept behind the veil of ignorance under the conditions of\nthe original position. But their rational choice is partially\ndetermined by the principles that free and equal moral persons in a\nwell ordered society who are motivated by their sense of justice\nreasonably can accept, agree to.and comply with, as the basic\nprinciples governing their social and political relations.\n\nThe parties are to assess principles according to the relative\nstability of the well ordered societies into which they are\nincorporated. Thus a well-ordered society of justice as fairness is to\nbe compared with a well-ordered society whose basic structure is\norganized according to the average utility principle, aggregate\nutility, perfectionism, intuitionism, libertarianism, and so on. They\nare to consider which of these societies\u2019 basic struture is\nrelatively more stable and likely to endure over time from one\ngeneration to the next, given natural and socially influenced\npsychological propensities and conditions of social cooperation as\nthey interact with alternative principles of justice.\n\nNow to return to Rawls\u2019s arguments for his principles of\njustice. The first of Rawls\u2019s three arguments highlights the\nidea that choice in the original position is an agreement,\nand involves certain \u201cstrains of commitment.\u201d It\nis assumed by all the parties that all will comply with the principles\nthey agree to once the veil is lifted and they are members of a\nwell-ordered society (TJ 176f./153f. and CP 250ff). Knowing that they\nwill be held to their commitment and expected to comply with\nprinciples for a well-ordered society, the parties must choose\nprinciples that they sincerely believe they will be able to accept,\nendorse and willingly observe under conditions where these principles\nare generally accepted and enforced. For reasons to be discussed\nshortly, Rawls says this condition favors agreement on the principles\nof justice over utilitarianism and other alternatives.\n\nBut first, consider the frequent objection that there is no genuine\nagreement in the original position, for the thick veil of ignorance\ndeprives the parties of all bases for bargaining (cf. TJ,\n139\u201340/120\u201321 rev.). In the absence of bargaining, it is\nsaid, there can be no contract. For contracts must involve a quid\npro quo\u2014something given for something received (called\n\u2018consideration\u2019 at common law). The parties in the OP\ncannot bargain without knowing what they have to offer or to gain in\nexchange. So (the objection continues) Rawls\u2019s original position\ndoes not involve a real social contract, unlike those that transpire,\nsay, in a state of nature. Rather, since the parties are all\n\u201cdescribed in the same way,\u201d there is no need for multiple\nparties but simply the rational choice of one person in the original\nposition (see Hampton, 1980, 334; see also Gauthier, 1974 and 1985,\n203).\n\nIn response, not all contracts involve bargaining or are of the nature\nof economic transactions. Some involve a mutual pledge and commitment\nto shared purposes and principles. Marriage contracts, or agreements\namong friends or the members of a religious, benevolent, or political\nassociation are often of this nature. For example, the Mayflower\nCompact was a \u201ccovenant\u201d to \u201ccombine ourselves\ntogether into a civil body politic\u201d charged with making and\nadministering \u201cjust and equal laws\u2026for the general\ngood.\u201d Likewise the U.S. Constitution represents itself as a\ncommitment wherein \u201cWe The People \u2026 ordain and establish\nthis Constitution\u201d in order \u201cto establish justice,\u201d\n\u201cpromote the general welfare,\u201d \u201csecure the blessings\nof liberty,\u201d and so on. The agreement in Rawls\u2019s original\nposition is more of this nature. Even though ignorant of particular\nfacts about themselves, the parties in fact do give something in\nexchange for something received: they all exchange their mutual\ncommitment to accept and abide by the principles of justice and to\nuphold just institutions once they enter their well-ordered society.\nEach agrees only on condition others do too, and all tie themselves\ninto social and political relations in perpetuity. Their agreement is\nfinal, and they will not permit its renegotiation should circumstances\nturn out to be different than some had hoped for. Their mutual\ncommitment to justice is reflected by the fact that once these\nprinciples become embodied in institutions there are no legitimate\nmeans that permit anyone to depart from the terms of their agreement.\nAs a result, the parties have to take seriously the moral and legal\nobligations and potential social sanctions they will incur as a result\nof their agreement, for there is no going back to the initial\nsituation. So if they do not sincerely believe that they can accept\nthe requirements of a conception of justice and voluntarily conform\ntheir actions and life plans accordingly, then these are strong\nreasons to avoid choosing those principles. It would not be rational\nfor the parties to take risks, falsely assuming that if they end up\nbadly, they can violate at will the terms of agreement or later regain\ntheir initial situation and renegotiate terms of cooperation (see\nFreeman, 1990; Freeman, 2007b, 180\u2013182).\n\nRawls gives special poignancy to this mutual commitment of the parties\nby making it a condition that the parties cannot choose and agree to\nprinciples in bad faith; they have to be able, not simply to live with\nand grudgingly accept, but instead to willingly endorse the principles\nof justice as members of society. Essential to Rawls\u2019s argument\nfor stability is the assumption of everyone\u2019s willing\ncompliance with requirements of justice. This is a feature of a\nwell-ordered society. The parties are assumed to have a sense of\njustice; indeed the development and exercise of it is one of their\nfundamental interests. Hence they must choose principles that that\nthey can not only accept and live with, but which are responsive to\ntheir sense of justice and they can unreservedly endorse. Given these\nconditions on choice, the parties cannot take risks with principles\nthey know they will have difficulty complying with voluntarily. They\nwould be making an agreement in bad faith, and this is ruled out by\nthe conditions of the original position.\n\nRawls contends that these \u201cstrains of commitment\u201d created\nby the parties\u2019 agreement strongly favor the principles of\njustice over the principles of utility and other teleological (and\nmost consequentialist) views. For everyone\u2019s freedom, basic\nrights and liberties, and basic needs are met by the principles of\njustice because of their egalitarian nature. Given the lack of these\nguarantees under the principle of utility, it is much more difficult\nfor those who end up worse off in a utilitarian society to willingly\naccept their situation and commit themselves to the utility principle.\nIt is a rare person indeed who can freely and without resentment\nsacrifice their life prospects so that those who are better off can\nhave even greater comforts, privileges, and powers. This is too much\nto demand of our capacities for human benevolence. It requires a kind\nof commitment that people cannot make in good faith, for who could\nwillingly support laws that are so detrimental to oneself and the\npeople one cares about most that they must sacrifice their fundamental\ninterests for the sake of those more advantaged? Besides, why should\nwe encourage such subservient dispositions and the accompanying lack\nof self-respect? The principles of justice, by contrast, conform\nbetter with everyone\u2019s interests, their desire for self-respect\nand their natural moral capacities to reciprocally recognize and\nrespect others\u2019 legitimate interests while freely promoting\ntheir own good. The strains of commitment incurred by agreement in the\noriginal position provide strong reasons for the parties to choose the\nprinciples of justice and reject the risks involved in choosing the\nprinciples of average or aggregate utility.\n6.4 Stability, Publicity, and Self-Respect\n\nRawls\u2019s strains-of-commitment argument explicitly relies upon a\nrarely noted feature of his argument: as mentioned earlier, there are\nin effect two social contracts. First, hypothetical agents\nsituated equally in the original position unanimously agree to\nprinciples of justice. This agreement has attracted the most attention\nfrom Rawls\u2019s critics. But the parties\u2019 hypothetical\nagreement in the original position is patterned on the general\nacceptability of a conception of justice by free and equal persons in\na well-ordered society. Rawls says, \u201cThe reason for invoking the\nconcept of a contract in the original position lies in its\ncorrespondence with the features of a well-ordered society [which]\nrequire\u2026that everyone accepts, and knows that the others\naccept, the same principles of justice\u201d (CP 250). In order for\nthe hypothetical parties in the original position to agree on\nprinciples of justice, there must be a high likelihood that real\npersons, given human nature and general facts about social and\neconomic cooperation, can also agree and act on the same principles,\nand that a society structured by these principles is feasible and can\nendure. This is the stability requirement referred to\nearlier. One conception of justice is relatively more stable than\nanother the more willing people are to observe its requirements under\nconditions of a well-ordered society. Assuming that each conception of\njustice has a corresponding society that is as well-ordered as can be\naccording to its terms, the stability question raised in\nTheory is: Which conception of justice is more likely to\nengage the moral sensibilities and sense of justice of free and equal\npersons as well as affirm their good? This requires an inquiry into\nmoral psychology and the human good, which takes up most of Part III\nof A Theory of Justice.\n\nRawls makes two arguments in Theory from the original\nposition that invoke the stability requirement, the arguments (1) from\npublicity and (2) from self-respect (see TJ, \u00a729)\n\n(1) The argument from publicity: Rawls contends that utilitarianism,\nperfectionism, and other \u201cteleological\u201d conceptions are\nunlikely to be freely acceptable to many citizens when made fully\npublic under the conditions of a well-ordered society. Recall the\npublicity condition discussed earlier: A feature of a\nwell-ordered society is that its regulative principles of justice are\npublicly known and appealed to as a basis for deciding laws and\njustifying basic institutions. Because all reasonable members of\nsociety accept the public conception of justice, there is no need for\nthe illusions and delusions of ideology for a society to function\nproperly and citizens to accept its laws and institutions willingly.\nIn this sense a well-ordered society lacks false consciousness about\nthe bases of social and political relations. (PL 68\u201369n.) A\nconception of justice that satisfies the publicity condition but that\ncannot maintain the stability of a well-ordered society is to be\nrejected by the parties in the original position. Rawls contends that\nunder the publicity condition justice as fairness generally engages\ncitizens\u2019 sense of justice and remains more stable than\nutilitarianism (TJ 177f./154f.rev.) For public knowledge that reasons\nof maximum average (or aggregate) utility determine the distribution\nof benefits and burdens would lead those worse-off to object to and\nresent their situation, and reject the principle of utility as the\nbasic principle governing social institutions. After all, the\nwell-being and interests of the least advantaged, perhaps even their\nbasic liberties, are being sacrificed for the greater happiness of\nthose who are already more fortunate and have a greater share of\nprimary social goods. It is too much to expect of human nature that\npeople should freely acquiesce in and embrace such publicly known\nterms of cooperation. By contrast, the principles of justice are\ndesigned to advance reciprocally everyone\u2019s position; those who\nare better off do not achieve their gains at the expense of the less\nadvantaged. \u201cSince everyone\u2019s good is affirmed, all\nacquire inclinations to uphold the scheme\u201d (TJ, 177/155). It is\na feature of our moral psychology, Rawls contends, that we normally\ncome to form attachments to people and institutions that are concerned\nwith our good; moreover we tend to resent those persons and\ninstitutions that take unfair advantage of us and act contrary to our\ngood. Rawls argues at length in chapter 8 of Theory,\n\u00a7\u00a770\u201375, that justice as fairness accords better than\nalternative principles with the reciprocity principles of moral\npsychology that are characteristic of human beings\u2019 moral\ndevelopment.\n\nIn Political Liberalism, Rawls expands the publicity\ncondition to include three levels: First, the principles of justice\ngoverning a well-ordered society are publicly known and appealed to in\npolitical debate and deliberation; second, so too are the general\nbeliefs in light of which society\u2019s conception of justice is\ngenerally accepted\u2014including beliefs about human nature and the\nway political and social institutions generally work\u2014and\ncitizens generally agree on these beliefs that support society\u2019s\nonception of justice. Finally the full justification of the public\nconception of justice is also publicly known (or at least publicly\navailable to any who are interested) and is reflected in\nsociety\u2019s system of law, judicial decisions and other political\ninstitutions, as well as its system of education.\n\n(2) The argument from the social bases of self-respect: The\npublicity condition is also crucial to Rawls\u2019s fourth argument\nfor the principles of justice, from the social bases of self-respect\n(TJ, 178\u201382/155\u201359 rev.). These principles, when publicly\nknown, give greater support to citizens\u2019 sense of\nself-respect than do utilitarian and perfectionist principles.\nRawls says self-respect is \u201cperhaps the most important primary\ngood,\u201d (TJ, 440/386 rev.) since few things seem worth doing if a\nperson has little sense of their own worth or no confidence in their\nabilities to execute a worthwhile life plan or fulfill the duties and\nexpectations in their role as citizens. The parties in the original\nposition will then aim to choose principles that best secure their\nsense of self-respect. Now being regarded by others as a free and\nindependent person of equal status with others is crucial to the\nself-respect of persons who regard themselves as free and equal\nmembers of a democratic society. Justice as fairness, by affording and\nprotecting the priority of equal basic liberties and fair equal\nopportunities for all, secures the status of each as free and equal\ncitizens. For example, because of equal political liberties, there are\nno \u201cpassive citizens\u201d who must depend on others to\npolitically protect their rights and interests; and with fair equal\nopportunities no one has grounds to experience the resentment that\ninevitably arises in societies where social positions are effectively\nclosed off to those less advantaged or less powerful. Moreover, the\nsecond principle secures adequate social powers and economic resources\nfor all so that they find the effective exercise of their equal basic\nliberties to be worthwhile. The second principle has the effect of\nmaking citizens socially and economically independent, so that no one\nneed be subservient to the will of another. Citizens then can regard\nand respect one another as equals, and not as masters or subordinates.\n(\u201cNon-domination,\u201d an idea central to contemporary\nRepublicanism, is then essential to citizens\u2019 sense of\nself-respect in Rawls\u2019s sense. See Pettit 1997.) Equal basic\nliberties, fair equal opportunities, and political and economic\nindependence are primary among the social bases of self-respect in a\ndemocratic society. The parties in the original position should then\nchoose the principles of justice over utilitarianism and other\nteleological views both to secure their sense of self-respect, and to\nprocure the same for others, thereby guaranteeing greater overall\nstability. In connection with Rawls\u2019s argument for the\ngreater stability of principles of justice on grounds of their\npublicity and the bases of self-respect, Rawls provides a Kantian\ninterpretation of difference principle. He says: \u201c[T]he\ndifference principle interprets the distinction between treating men\nas means only and treating them as ends in themselves. To regard\npersons as ends in themselves in the basic design of society is to\nagree to forgo those gains that do not contribute to everyone\u2019s\nexpectations. By contrast to regard persons as means is to be prepared\nto impose on those already less favored still lower prospects of life\nfor the sake of the higher expectations of others\u201d (TJ 157\nrev.). Rawls says the principle of utility does just this; it treats\nthe less fortunate as means since it requires them to accept even\nlower life prospects for the sake of others who are more fortunate and\nalready better off. This exhibits a lack of respect for the less\nadvantaged and in turn has the effect of undermining their sense of\nself respect. (TJ 158 rev.) The difference principle, by contrast,\ndoes not treat people as means or undermine their sense of self\nrespect, and this adds to the reasons the parties have for choosing\nthe principles of justice instead of the principle of utility.\n\n\nRawls substantially relies on the publicity condition to argue against\nutilitarianism and perfectionism. He says publicity \u201carises\nnaturally from a contractarian standpoint\u201d (TJ, 133/115 rev.).\nIn Theory he puts great weight on publicity ultimately\nbecause he thinks that giving people knowledge of the moral bases of\ncoercive laws and the principles governing society is a condition of\nfully acknowledging and respecting them as free and responsible\nrational moral agents. With publicity of principles of justice, people\nhave knowledge of the real reasons for their social and political\nrelations and the formative influences of the basic structure on their\ncharacters, plans and prospects. In a well-ordered society with a\npublic conception of justice, there is no need for an \u201cesoteric\nmorality\u201d that must be confined \u201cto an enlightened\nfew\u201d (as Sidgwick says of utilitarianism, Sidgwick 1907 [1981],\n490). Moreover, public principles of justice can serve agents in their\npractical reasoning and provide democratic citizens a common basis for\npolitical argument and justification. These considerations underlie\nRawls\u2019s later contention that having knowledge of the principles\nthat determine the bases of social relations is a precondition of\nindividuals\u2019 freedom.(CP 325f.) Rawls means in part that\npublicity of society\u2019s fundamental principles is a condition of\ncitizens\u2019 exercise of the powers and abilities that enable them\nto take full responsibility for their lives. Full publicity is then a\ncondition of the political and (in TJ) moral autonomy of\npersons, which are significant values according to justice as\nfairness. (TJ \u00a778, PL 68, CP 325\u201326)\n\nUtilitarians often regard Rawls\u2019s emphasis on the publicity of\nthe fundamental principles underlying social cooperation as\nunwarranted. They contend that publicity of laws is of course\nimportant for them to be effective, but there\u2019s no practical\nneed for the publicity of the fundamental principles (such as the\nprinciples of efficiency and utility) that govern political decisions,\nthe economy, and society, much less so for the publicity of the full\njustification of these principles. Most people are not interested and\nhave little understanding of the complex often technical details that\nmust go into deciding laws and social policies. Moreover, as Sidgwick\nclaimed, utilitarianism functions better as an \u201cesoteric\nmorality\u201d that is not generally incorporated into the public\njustification of laws and institutions. Others claim that\nRawls\u2019s arguments from publicity are exaggerated. If people were\nproperly educated to believe that promoting greater overall happiness\nor welfare is the ultimate requirement of justice and more generally\nof morality, then just as they have for centuries constrained their\nconduct and their self-interests and accepted political constraints on\ntheir own liberties for the sake of their religious beliefs, so too\ncould they be educated to accept the promotion of social utility and\nthe general welfare as the fundamental bases for social and political\ncooperation.\nSupplementary Documents on Other Topics\n\nAdditional topics concerining the original position are discussed\nin the following supplementary documents:\n\nThe Argument for the Difference Principle. \nExplains the Difference Principle and the least advantaged class.\nComparison of the difference principle with mixed conceptions,\nincluding restricted utility. Arguments from reciprocity, stability\nand self-respect, and the strains of commitment. Rawls\u2019s reasons\nwhy the difference principle supports property owning democracy rather\nthan welfare-state capitalism.\nThe Four Stage Sequence.\nHow principles chosen in OP (first stage) apply to choice of political\nconstitution (second-stage), democratic legislation (third stage), and\napplication of laws to particular circumstances (fourth stage).\nIdeal Theory, Strict Compliance and the Well-Ordered Society.\nWhy strict compliance is said to be necessary to justification of\nuniversal principles.  Sen\u2019s, Mills\u2019s, and others\u2019\ncriticisms of ideal theory.  Rawls\u2019s contention that ideal\ntheory is necessary to determine injustice in non-ideal conditions.\nRole of non-ideal theory. \nA Liberal Feminist Critique of the Original Position and Justice within the Family. \n Criticism of \u201cheads of families\u201d assumption in OP and\nRawls\u2019s response to criticisms that principles do not secure\nequal justice for women and children.  Rawls\u2019s discussion of\njustice within the family.\nThe Original Position and the Law of Peoples.\nRawls\u2019s extension of OP to decisions on the Law of Peoples\ngoverning relations among liberal and decent societies.  Human rights,\nthe duty to assist burdened peoples, oulaw societies, and\nRawls\u2019s rejection of a global principle of distributive\njustice.\nConstructivism, Objectivity, Autonomy, and the Original Position.\nKantian Interpretation of the OP and Constructivism.  OP as a\nprocedure of construction and objective point of view.  Response to\nHumean argument that social agreements cannot justify.  Role of OP in\nreflective equilibrium.  \nIs the Original Position Necessary or Relevant? \n Reply to claims that OP is superfluous or irrelevant. Why Rawls\nthinks rational acceptance of principles in OP and congruence of Right\nand Good is essential to justice.\n\n",
