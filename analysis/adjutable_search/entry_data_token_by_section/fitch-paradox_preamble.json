    "main_text": "\n Fitch\u2019s paradox of knowability (aka the knowability paradox\nor Church-Fitch Paradox) concerns any theory committed to the thesis\nthat all truths are knowable. Historical examples of such theories\narguably include Michael Dummett\u2019s semantic antirealism (i.e.,\nthe view that any truth is verifiable), mathematical constructivism\n(i.e., the view that the truth of a mathematical formula depends on\nthe mental constructions mathematicians use to prove those formulas),\nHilary Putnam\u2019s internal realism (i.e., the view that truth is\nwhat we would believe in ideal epistemic circumstances), Charles\nSanders Peirce\u2019s pragmatic theory of truth (i.e., that truth is\nwhat we would agree to at the limit of inquiry), logical positivism\n(i.e., the view that meaning is giving by verification conditions),\nKant\u2019s transcendental idealism (i.e., that all knowledge is\nknowledge of appearances), and George Berkeley\u2019s idealism (i.e.,\nthat to be is to be perceivable). \n\nThe operative concept of \u201cknowability\u201d remains elusive but is\nmeant to fall somewhere between equating truth uninformatively with\nwhat God would know and equating truth naively with what humans\nactually know. Equating truth with what God would know does not\nimprove intelligibility, and equating it with what humans actually\nknow fails to appreciate the objectivity and discoverability of truth.\nThe middle way, what we might call moderate antirealism, can\nbe characterized logically somewhere in the ballpark of the\nknowability principle:\n\n\\[\\tag{K Principle}\n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp),\n\\]\n\n\nwhich says, formally, for all propositions \\(p\\), if \\(p\\)\nthen it is possible to know that \\(p\\). \n\nThe great problem for the middle way is Fitch\u2019s paradox. It\nis the proof that shows (in a normal modal logic augmented with the\nknowledge operator) that \u201call truths are knowable\u201d entails \u201call\ntruths are known\u201d:\n\n\\[\\tag{K Paradox}\n\\forall p(p \\rightarrow \\Diamond Kp) \\vdash \\forall p(p \\rightarrow Kp).\n\\]\n\n\nAs such the proof does the interesting work in collapsing moderate\nanti-realism into naive idealism. \n\nWhat\u2019s the paradox? Timothy Williamson (2000b) says the knowability\nparadox is not a paradox; it\u2019s an\n\u201cembarrassment\u201d\u2013\u2013an embarrassment to various brands of\nantirealism that have long overlooked a simple counterexample. He\nnotes it\u2019s \u201can affront\u201d to various philosophical theories, but\nnot to common sense. Others disagree. The paradox isn\u2019t that the\nFitch proof swiftly threatens the middle way. It\u2019s that the\nFitch proof, employing minimal epistemic modal resources, collapses\nthe middle way into the naive way. The paradox, as articulated in\nKvanvig (2006) and Brogaard and Salerno (2008), is that moderate\nantirealism appears not to be expressible as a distinct thesis,\nlogically weaker than naive idealism. That is interesting and\ntroublesome independently of one\u2019s attitude for or against moderate\nantirealism.\n",
