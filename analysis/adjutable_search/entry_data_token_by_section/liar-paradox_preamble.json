    "main_text": "\n\nThe first sentence in this essay is a lie. There is something odd\nabout saying so, as has been known since ancient times. To see why,\nremember that all lies are untrue. Is the first sentence true? If it\nis, then it is a lie, and so it is not true. Conversely, suppose that\nit is not true. We (viz., the authors) have said it, and normally\nthings are said with the intention of being believed. Saying something\nthat way when it is untrue is a lie. But then, given what the sentence\nsays, it is true after all!\n\nThat there is some sort of puzzle to be found with sentences like the\nfirst one of this essay has been noted frequently throughout the\nhistory of philosophy. It was discussed in classical times, notably by\nthe Megarians, but it was also mentioned by Aristotle and by Cicero.\nAs one of the insolubilia, it was the subject of extensive\ninvestigation by medieval logicians such as Buridan. More recently,\nwork on this problem has been an integral part of the development of\nmodern mathematical logic, and it has become a subject of extensive\nresearch in its own right. The paradox is sometimes called the\n\u2018Epimenides paradox\u2019 as the tradition attributes a\nsentence like the first one in this essay to Epimenides of Crete, who\nis reputed to have said that all Cretans are always liars. That some\nCretan has said so winds up in no less a source than New\n Testament![1]\n\nLying is a complicated matter, but what\u2019s puzzling about\nsentences like the first one of this essay isn\u2019t essentially\ntied to intentions, social norms, or anything like that. Rather, it\nseems to have something to do with truth, or at least, some semantic\nnotion related to truth. The puzzle is usually named \u2018the Liar\nparadox\u2019, though this really names a family of paradoxes that\nare associated with our type of puzzling sentence. The family is aptly\nnamed one of paradoxes, as they seem to lead to incoherent\nconclusions, such as: \u201ceverything is true\u201d. Indeed, the\nLiar seems to allow us to reach such conclusions on the basis of\nlogic, plus some very obvious principles that have sometimes been\ncounted as principles of logic. Thus, we have the rather surprising\nsituation of something near or like logic alone leading us to\nincoherence. This is perhaps the most virulent strain of paradox, and\ndealing with it has been an important task in logic for about as long\nas there has been logic.\n\nIn this essay, we will review the important members of the family of\nLiar paradoxes, and some of the important ideas about how these\nparadoxes might be resolved. The past few thousand years have yielded\na great number of proposals, and we will not be able to examine all of\nthem; instead, we will focus on a few that have, in recent\ndiscussions, proved to be important.\n",
