    "main_text": "Major Works || The Order of Things\n3.2 The Order of Things\n\nThe book that made Foucault famous, Les mots et les choses\n(translated into English under the title The Order of\nThings), is in many ways an odd interpolation into the\ndevelopment of his thought. Its subtitle, \u201cAn Archaeology of the\nHuman Sciences\u201d, suggests an expansion of the earlier critical\nhistories of psychiatry and clinical medicine into other modern\ndisciplines such as economics, biology, and philology. And indeed\nthere is an extensive account of the various \u201cempirical\ndisciplines\u201d of the Renaissance and the Classical Age that\nprecede these modern human sciences. But there is little or nothing of\nthe implicit social critique found in the History of Madness\nor even The Birth of the Clinic. Instead, Foucault offers an\nanalysis of what knowledge meant\u2014and how this meaning\nchanged\u2014in Western thought from the Renaissance to the present.\nAt the heart of his account is the notion of representation. Here we\nfocus on his treatment of representation in philosophical thought,\nwhere we find Foucault\u2019s most direct engagement with traditional\nphilosophical questions.\n3.2.1 Classical Representation\n\nFoucault argues that from Descartes up to Kant (during what he calls\nthe Classical Age) representation was simply assimilated to thought:\nto think was to employ ideas to represent the object of thought. But,\nhe says, we need to be clear about what it meant for an idea to\nrepresent an object. This was not, first of all, any sort of relation\nof resemblance: there were no features (properties) of the idea that\nthemselves constituted the representation of the object. (Saying this,\nhowever, does not require that the idea itself have no properties or\neven that these properties are not relevant to the idea\u2019s\nrepresentation of the object.) By contrast, during the Renaissance,\nknowledge was understood as a matter of resemblance between\nthings.\n\nThe map is a useful model of Classical representation. It consists,\nfor example, of a set of lines of varying widths, lengths, and colors,\nand thereby represents the roads in and around a city. This is not\nbecause the roads have the properties of the map (the widths, lengths,\nand colors of the lines) but because the abstract structure given in\nthe map (the relations among the lines) duplicates the abstract\nstructure of the roads. At the heart of Classical thought is the\nprinciple that we know in virtue of having ideas that, in this sense,\nrepresent what we know. Of course, in contrast to the map, we do not\nneed to know what the actual features of our ideas are in virtue of\nwhich they are able to represent. (In Descartes\u2019 scholastic\nterminology, we do not need to know their \u201cformal\nreality\u201d.) We need to know only the abstract structure that they\nshare with the things they represent (the structure of what Descartes\ncalls their \u201cobjective reality\u201d). We do, however, have\ndirect (introspective) access to the abstract structures of our ideas:\nwe can \u201csee\u201d what representational structure they have.\nFurther, we can alter an idea\u2019s structure to make it a better\nrepresentation of an object, as we can alter a map to improve it.\n\nHow, on the Classical view, do we know that an idea is a\nrepresentation of an object\u2014and an adequate representation? Not,\nFoucault argues, by comparing the idea with the object as it is apart\nfrom its representation. This is impossible, since it would require\nknowing the object without a representation (when, for Classical\nthought, to know is to represent). The only possibility is\nthat the idea itself must make it apparent that it is a\nrepresentation. The idea represents the very fact that it is a\nrepresentation. As to the question of whether an idea is a\nrepresentation, this \u201cself-referential\u201d feature is all\nthere is to it. As to adequacy, it must be that some subset of ideas\nlikewise bear witness to their own adequacy\u2014as, for example,\nDescartes\u2019 \u201cclear and distinct perceptions\u201d or\nHume\u2019s simple impressions. In this sense, early modern\nphilosophy is based on \u201cintuition\u201d (intellectual or\nsensory). Note, however, that an \u201cintuition\u201d of an\nidea\u2019s adequacy does not, of itself, establish the independent\nexistence of the object represented by the idea. As far as the early\nmodern view is concerned, there may be no such objects; or, if there\nare, this needs to be established by some other means (e.g., an\nargument or some other sort of intuition).\n\nWe see, then, that for Foucault the key to Classical knowing is the\nidea, that is, mental representation. Classical thinkers might\ndisagree about the actual ontological status of ideas (their formal\nreality); but they all agreed that as representations (epistemically,\nif not ontologically) they were \u201cnon-physical\u201d and\n\u201cnon-historical\u201d; that is, precisely as representing their\nobjects, they could not be conceived as having any role in the causal\nnetworks of the natural or the human worlds. From this it further\nfollowed that language\u2014precisely as a physical and/or historical\nreality\u2014could have no fundamental role in knowledge. Language\ncould be nothing more than a higher-order instrument of thought: a\nphysical representation of ideas, having no meaning except in relation\nto them.\n3.2.2 Kant\u2019s Critique of Classical Representation\n\nFoucault maintains that the great \u201cturn\u201d in modern\nphilosophy occurs with Kant (though presumably he is merely an example\nof something much broader and deeper). Kant raises the question of\nwhether ideas do in fact represent their objects and, if so, how (in\nvirtue of what) they do so. In other words, ideas are no longer taken\nas the unproblematic vehicles of knowledge; it is now possible to\nthink that knowledge might be (or have roots in) something other than\nrepresentation. This did not mean that representation had nothing at\nall to do with knowledge. Perhaps some (or even all) knowledge still\nessentially involved ideas\u2019 representing objects. But, Foucault\ninsists, the thought that was only now (with Kant) possible was that\nrepresentation itself (and the ideas that represented) could have an\norigin in something other than representation.\n\nThis thought, according to Foucault, led to some important and\ndistinctively modern possibilities. The first was developed by Kant\nhimself, who thought that representations (thoughts or ideas) were\nthemselves the product of (\u201cconstituted\u201d by) the human\nmind. Not, however, produced by the mind as a natural or psychological\nreality, but as belonging to a special epistemic realm, transcendental\nsubjectivity. Foucault contends that Kant maintained the Classical\nview that knowledge cannot be understood as a physical or historical\nreality, but he located the grounds of knowledge in a domain (the\ntranscendental) more fundamental than the ideas it subtended:\nsubjectivity insofar as it is the condition of the possibility of\nthinking and judging. However, Kant did not think of transcendental\nsubjectivity as located on a level of being beyond reality; it was not\nan unfounded postulate of metaphysical speculation. According to\nFoucault, such metaphysical notions were developed later by\npost-Kantian idealists such as Hegel. Another\u2014and in some ways\nmore typically modern\u2014view was that ideas were themselves\nhistorical realities. This could be most plausibly developed, as\nHerder did, by tying ideas essentially to language, now regarded as\nthe primary (and historicized) vehicle of knowledge. But such an\napproach was not viable in its pure form, since to make knowledge\nentirely historical would deprive it of any normative character and so\ndestroy its character as knowledge. In other words, even when modern\nthought made knowledge essentially historical, it had to retain some\nfunctional equivalent of Kant\u2019s transcendental realm to\nguarantee the normative validity of knowledge.\n3.2.3 Language and \u201cMan\u201d\n\nAt this point, The Order of Things introduces the two central\nfeatures of thought after Kant: the return of language and the\n\u201cbirth of man.\u201d Our discussion above readily explains why\nFoucault talks of a return of language: it now has an independent and\nessential role that it did not have in the Classical view. But the\nreturn is not a monolithic phenomenon. Language is related to\nknowledge in diverse ways, each of which corresponds to a distinctive\nsort of \u201creturn.\u201d So, for example, the history of natural\nlanguages has introduced ambiguities that we can try to eliminate\nthrough techniques of formalization. On the other hand, this same\nhistory may have deposited fundamental truths in our languages that we\ncan unearth only by the methods of hermeneutic interpretation. (So\nthese two apparently opposed approaches\u2014contributing to the\ndivision of analytic and continental philosophy\u2014are in fact,\naccording to Foucault, complementary projects of modern thought.) But\nthere is yet another possibility: freed from its subordination to\nideas, language can function (as in the Renaissance) as an autonomous\nreality\u2014indeed as even more deeply autonomous than Renaissance\nlanguage, since there is no system of resemblances binding it to the\nworld. Even more, Foucault suggests, language does not have to refer\nto anything in the world; it can speak only its own meaning. This is\nthe realm of \u201cpure literature,\u201d evoked by Mallarm\u00e9\nwhen he answered Nietzsche\u2019s (genealogical) question, \u201cWho\nis speaking?\u201d with, \u201cLanguage itself.\u201d In contrast\nto the Renaissance, however, there is no divine Word underlying and\ngiving unique truth to the words of language. Literature is literally\nnothing but language\u2014or rather many languages, expressing their\nown meanings.\n\nEven more important than language is the figure of man. The most\nimportant point about \u201cman\u201d is that it is an\nepistemological concept. Man, Foucault says, did not exist during the\nClassical age (or before). This is not because there was no idea of\nhuman beings as a species or of human nature as a psychological,\nmoral, or political reality. Rather, \u201cthere was no\nepistemological consciousness of man as such\u201d (The Order of\nThings, [1970: 309]). But even \u201cepistemological\u201d\nneeds construal. There is no doubt that even in the Classical age\nhuman beings were conceived as the locus of knowledge (since humans\npossess the ideas that represent the world). The notion of man, on the\nother hand, is epistemological in the Kantian sense of a\ntranscendental subject that is also an empirical object. For the\nClassical age, human beings are the locus of representations but not,\nas for Kant, their source. There is, in Classical thought, no room for\nthe modern notion of \u201cconstitution.\u201d\n\nFoucault illustrates his point through a striking discussion of\nDescartes\u2019 cogito, showing why it is an indubitable certitude\nwithin the classical episteme, but not within the modern episteme.\nThere are two ways of questioning the force of the cogito. One is to\nsuggest that the subject (the thinking self, the I) that Descartes\nconcludes necessarily exists in the act of thinking is something more\nthan just the act of representing objects; so we cannot go from\nrepresentation to a thinker. But for the Classical Age this makes no\nsense, since thinking is representation. A second criticism would be\nthat the self as representer may not be \u201creally real\u201d but\nmerely the \u201cproduct of\u201d (constituted by) a mind that is\nreal in a fuller sense. But this objection has weight only if we can\nthink of this \u201cmore real\u201d mind as having the self as an\nobject in some sense other than representing it. (Otherwise, there is\nno basis for saying that the self as representer is \u201cless\nreal\u201d.) But, once again, this is precisely what cannot be\nthought in Classical terms.\n3.2.4 The Analytic of Finitude\n\nAt the very heart of man is his finitude: the fact that, as described\nby the modern empirical sciences, he is limited by the various\nhistorical forces (organic, economic, linguistic) operating on him.\nThis finitude is a philosophical problem because man as a historically\nlimited empirical being must somehow also be the source of the\nrepresentations whereby we know the empirical world, including\nourselves as empirical beings. I (my consciousness) must, as Kant put\nit, be both an empirical object of representation and the\ntranscendental source of representations. How is this possible?\nFoucault\u2019s view is that, in the end, it is not\u2014and that\nthe impossibility (historically realized) means the collapse of the\nmodern episteme. What Foucault calls the \u201canalytic of\nfinitude\u201d sketches the historical case for this conclusion,\nexamining the major efforts (together making up the heart of modern\nphilosophy) to understand man as\n\u201cempirico-transcendental.\u201d\n\nThe question\u2014and the basic strategy for answering it\u2014go\nback, of course, to Kant, who put forward the following crucial idea:\nthat the very factors that make us finite (our subjection to space,\ntime, causality, etc.) are also conditions necessary for the\npossibility of empirical knowledge. Our finitude is, therefore,\nsimultaneously founded and founding (positive and fundamental, as\nFoucault puts it). The project of modern (Kantian and post-Kantian)\nphilosophy\u2014the analytic of finitude\u2014is to show how this is\npossible.\n\nSome modern philosophy tries to resolve the problem of man by, in\neffect, reducing the transcendental to the empirical. For example,\nnaturalism attempts to explain knowledge in terms of natural science\n(physics, biology), while Marxism appeals to historical social\nsciences. (The difference is that the first grounds knowledge in the\npast\u2014e.g., an evolutionary history\u2014whereas the second\ngrounds it in a revolutionary future that will transcend the\nlimitations of ideology.) Either approach simply ignores the terms of\nthe problem: that man must be regarded as irreducibly both empirical\nand transcendental.\n\nIt might seem that Husserl\u2019s phenomenology has carried out the\nKantian project of synthesizing man as object and as subject by\nradicalizing the Cartesian project; that is, by grounding our\nknowledge of empirical truths in the transcendental subject. The\nproblem, however, is that, as Foucault sees it, the modern notion of\nman excludes Descartes\u2019 idea of the cogito as a \u201csovereign\ntransparency\u201d of pure consciousness. Foucault\u2019s key claim\nin the dense chapter 9, \u201cMan and his doubles,\u201d is that\nthought is no longer pure representation and therefore cannot be\nseparated from an \u201cunthought\u201d (i.e., the given empirical\nand historical truths about who we are). In other words, I can no\nlonger go from \u201cI think\u201d to \u201cI am\u201d because the\ncontent of my reality (what I am) is always more than the content of\nany merely thinking self (I am, e.g., living, working, and\nspeaking\u2014and all these take me beyond the realm of mere\nthought). Or, conversely, if we use \u201cI\u201d to denote me\nsimply as a conscious being, then I \u201cam not\u201d much of what\nI (as a self in the world) am. As a result, to the extent that Husserl\nhas grounded everything in the transcendental subject, this is not the\nsubject (cogito) of Descartes but the modern cogito, which includes\nthe empirical unthought. Foucault contends that phenomenology, like\nall modern thought, must accept the unthought as the ineliminable\n\u201cother\u201d of man. Nor are the existential phenomenologists\n(Sartre and Merleau-Ponty) able to solve the problem. Foucault\nrecognizes that they avoid positing a transcendental ego and\ninstead focus on the concrete reality of man-in-the world. But this,\nFoucault claims, is just a more subtle way of reducing the\ntranscendental to the empirical.\n\nFinally, Foucault argues that some philosophers (Hegel and Marx in one\nway, Nietzsche and Heidegger in another) have tried to resolve the\nproblem of man\u2019s dual status by treating him as a historical\nreality. But this move encounters the difficulty that man has to be\nboth a product of historical processes and the origin of history. If\nwe treat man as a product of history, we find ourselves reducing his\nreality to something external to him (this is what Foucault calls the\n\u201cretreat\u201d from man\u2019s origin). But if we insist on a\n\u201creturn\u201d to man as his own proper origin, then we can no\nlonger make sense of his place in the empirical world. This paradox\nmay explain the endless modern obsession with origins, but there is\nnever any way out of the contradiction between man as originator and\nman as originated. Nonetheless, Foucault thinks that the modern\npursuit of the question of origins has provided us with a deeper sense\nof the ontological significance of time, particularly in the thought\nof Nietzsche and Heidegger, who reject Hegel\u2019s and Marx\u2019s\nview of the return to our origin as a redemptive fullness of being,\nand instead see it as a confrontation with the nothingness of our\nexistence (1966 [1970: 334).\n3.3 From Archaeology to Genealogy\n\nFoucault explicitly presents The Order of Things as an\n\u201carchaeological\u201d approach to the history of thought. Three\nyears later, in 1969, he published The Archaeology of\nKnowledge, a methodological treatise that explicitly formulates\nwhat he took to be the archaeological method that he used not only in\nThe Order of Things but also (at least implicitly) in\nHistory of Madness and The Birth of the Clinic. The\nkey idea of the archaeological method is that systems of thought and\nknowledge (epistemes or discursive formations, in Foucault\u2019s\nterminology) are governed by rules, beyond those of grammar and logic,\nthat operate beneath the consciousness of individual subjects and\ndefine a system of conceptual possibilities that determines the\nboundaries of thought in a given domain and period. So, for example,\nHistory of Madness should, Foucault maintained, be read as an\nintellectual excavation of the radically different discursive\nformations that governed talk and thought about madness from the\nseventeenth through the nineteenth centuries.\n\nArchaeology was an essential method for Foucault because it supported\na historiography that did not rest on the primacy of the consciousness\nof individual subjects; it allowed the historian of thought to operate\nat an unconscious level that displaced the primacy of the subject\nfound in both phenomenology and in traditional historiography.\nHowever, archaeology\u2019s critical force was restricted to the\ncomparison of the discursive formations of different periods. Such\ncomparisons could suggest the contingency of a given way of thinking\nby showing that the people living in previous ages had thought very\ndifferently (and, apparently, just as effectively). But mere\narchaeological analysis could say nothing about the causes of the\ntransition from one way of thinking to another and so had to ignore\nperhaps the most forceful case for the contingency of entrenched\ncontemporary positions. Genealogy, the new method first deployed in\nDiscipline and Punish, was intended to remedy this\ndeficiency.\n\nFoucault intended the term \u201cgenealogy\u201d to evoke\nNietzsche\u2019s genealogy of morals, particularly with its\nsuggestion of complex, mundane, inglorious origins\u2014in no way\npart of any grand scheme of progressive history. The point of a\ngenealogical analysis is to show that a given system of thought\n(itself uncovered in its essential structures by archaeology, which\ntherefore remains part of Foucault\u2019s historiography) was the\nresult of contingent turns of history, not the outcome of rationally\ninevitable trends.\n3.4 History of the Prison\n\nDiscipline and Punish, published in 1975, is a genealogical\nstudy of the development of the \u201cgentler\u201d modern way of\nimprisoning criminals rather than torturing or killing them. While\nrecognizing the element of genuinely enlightened reform, Foucault\nparticularly emphasizes how such reform also becomes a vehicle of more\neffective control: \u201cto punish less, perhaps; but certainly to\npunish better\u201d(1975 [1977: 82]). He further argues that the new\nmode of punishment becomes the model for control of an entire society,\nwith factories, hospitals, and schools modeled on the modern prison.\nWe should not, however, think that the deployment of this model was\ndue to the explicit decisions of some central controlling agency.\nFoucault\u2019s analysis shows how techniques and institutions,\ndeveloped for different and often quite innocuous purposes, converged\nto create the modern system of disciplinary power.\n\nAt the core of Foucault\u2019s picture of modern disciplinary society\nare three primary techniques of control: hierarchical observation,\nnormalizing judgment, and the examination. To a great extent, control\nover people (power) can be achieved merely by observing them. So, for\nexample, the tiered rows of seats in a stadium not only makes it easy\nfor spectators to see but also for guards or security cameras to scan\nthe audience. A perfect system of observation would allow one guard to\nsee everything (a situation approximated, as we shall see, in Jeremy\nBentham\u2019s Panopticon). But since this is not usually possible,\nthere is a need for \u201crelays\u201d of observers, hierarchically\nordered, through whom observed data passes from lower to higher\nlevels.\n\nA distinctive feature of modern power (disciplinary control) is its\nconcern with what people have not done (nonobservence), with, that is,\na person\u2019s failure to reach required standards. This concern\nillustrates the primary function of modern disciplinary systems: to\ncorrect deviant behavior. The main goal is not revenge (as in the case\nof the tortures of premodern punishment) but reform, where reform\nmeans primarily coming to live by society\u2019s standards or norms.\nDiscipline through imposing precise and detailed norms,\n\u201cnormalization,\u201d is quite different from the older system\nof judicial punishment, which merely judges each action as either\nallowed or not allowed by the law and does not indicate whether those\njudged are \u201cnormal\u201d or \u201cabnormal.\u201d This idea\nof normalization is pervasive in our society: e.g., national standards\nfor educational programs, for medical practice, for industrial\nprocesses and products.\n\nThe examination (for example, of students in schools, of patients in\nhospitals) is a method of control that combines hierarchical\nobservation with normalizing judgment. It is a prime example of what\nFoucault calls power/knowledge, since it combines into a unified whole\n\u201cthe deployment of force and the establishment of truth\u201d\n(1975 [1977: 184]). It both elicits the truth about those who undergo\nthe examination (tells what they know or what is the state of their\nhealth) and controls their behavior (by forcing them to study or\ndirecting them to a course of treatment).\n\nOn Foucault\u2019s account, the relation of power and knowledge is\nfar closer than in the familiar Baconian engineering model, for which\n\u201cknowledge is power\u201d means that knowledge is an instrument\nof power, although the two exist quite independently. Foucault\u2019s\npoint is rather that, at least for the study of human beings, the\ngoals of power and the goals of knowledge cannot be separated: in\nknowing we control and in controlling we know.\n\nThe examination also situates individuals in a \u201cfield of\ndocumentation.\u201d The results of exams are recorded in documents\nthat provide detailed information about the individuals examined and\nallow power systems to control them (e.g., absentee records for\nschools, patients\u2019 charts in hospitals). On the basis of these\nrecords, those in control can formulate categories, averages, and\nnorms that are in turn a basis for knowledge. The examination turns\nthe individual into a \u201ccase\u201d\u2014in both senses of the\nterm: a scientific example and an object of care. Caring is always\nalso an opportunity for control.\n\nBentham\u2019s Panopticon is, for Foucault, a paradigmatic\narchitectural model of modern disciplinary power. It is a design for a\nprison, built so that each inmate is separated from and invisible to\nall the others (in separate \u201ccells\u201d) and each inmate is\nalways visible to a guard situated in a central tower. Guards do not\nin fact always see each inmate; the point is that they could\nat any time. Since inmates never know whether they are being observed,\nthey must behave as if they are always seen and observed. As a result,\ncontrol is achieved more by the possibility of internal monitoring of\nthose controlled than by actual supervision or heavy physical\nconstraints.\n\nThe principle of the Panopticon can be applied not only to prisons but\nalso to any system of disciplinary power (a factory, a hospital, a\nschool). And, in fact, although Bentham himself was never able to\nbuild it, its principle has come to pervade aspects of modern society.\nIt is the instrument through which modern discipline has been able to\nreplace pre-modern sovereignty (kings, judges) as the fundamental\npower relation.\n\nFoucault\u2019s genealogy follows Nietzsche as well as existential\nphenomenology in that it aims to bring the body into the focus of\nhistory. Rather than histories of mentalities or ideas, genealogies\nare \u201chistories of the body.\u201d They examine the historical\npractices through which the body becomes an object of techniques and\ndeployments of power. In Discipline and Punish, Foucault\nshows how disciplinary techniques produce \u201cdocile bodies\u201d:\nbodies of prisoners, soldiers, workers and schoolchildren were\nsubjected to disciplinary power in order to make them more useful and\nat the same time easier to control. The human body became a machine\nthe functioning of which could be optimized, calculated, and improved.\nIts functions, movements and capabilities were broken down into narrow\nsegments, analyzed in detail and recomposed in a maximally effective\nway.\n\nBy historicizing the body, Foucault\u2019s genealogies also have\ndistinctive philosophical implications. They question the naturalistic\nexplanatory framework that understands human nature\u2014uncovered by\nscience\u2014as the basis for such complex areas of behavior as\nsexuality, insanity or criminality. A key idea in Foucault\u2019s\nhistorical analysis of the modern penal institutions is that they\noperate with markedly different rationality than those that are aimed\nsolely at retribution through pain. He effectively reveals the double\nrole of the present system: it aims at both punishing and correcting,\nand therefore it mixes juridical and scientific practices. Foucault\nargued that the intervention of criminal psychiatry in the field of\nlaw that occurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century, for\nexample, was part of the gradual shift in penal practice from a focus\non the crime to a focus on the criminal, from the action to agency and\npersonality. The new idea of the \u201cdangerous individual\u201d\nreferred to the danger potentially inherent in the criminal person.\nThe new rationality could not function in an effective way in the\nexisting system without the emergence of new forms of scientific\nknowledge such as criminal psychiatry that enabled the\ncharacterization of criminals in themselves, beneath their acts.\nFoucault suggests that this shift resulted in the emergence of new,\ninsidious forms of domination and violence. The critical impact of\nDiscipline and Punish thus lies in its ability to reveal the\nprocesses of subject formation that operate in modern penal\ninstitutions. The modern prison does not just punish by depriving its\ninmates of liberty, it categorizes them as delinquent subjects, types\nof people with a dangerous, criminal nature.\n3.5 History of Modern Sexuality\n\nFoucault\u2019s history of sexuality was originally projected as a\nfairly straightforward extension of the genealogical approach of\nDiscipline and Punish to the topic of sexuality.\nFoucault\u2019s idea is that the various modern fields of knowledge\nabout sexuality (various \u201csciences of sexuality,\u201d\nincluding psychoanalysis) have an intimate association with the power\nstructures of modern society and so are prime candidates for\ngenealogical analysis. The first volume of this project, The\nHistory of Sexuality, Vol. I: The Will to Knowledge, published in\n1976, was intended as the introduction to a series of studies on\nparticular aspects of modern sexuality (children, women,\n\u201cperverts,\u201d population). It outlined the project of the\noverall history, explaining the basic viewpoint and the methods to be\nused.\n\nOn Foucault\u2019s account, modern control of sexuality parallels\nmodern control of criminality by making sex (like crime) an object of\nallegedly scientific disciplines, which simultaneously offer knowledge\nand domination of their objects. However, it becomes apparent that\nthere is a further dimension in the power associated with the sciences\nof sexuality. Not only is there control exercised via other\npeople\u2019s knowledge of individuals such as doctors\u2019\nknowledge, for example; there is also control via individuals\u2019\nknowledge of themselves. Individuals internalize the norms laid down\nby the sciences of sexuality and monitor themselves in an effort to\nconform to these norms. Thus, they are controlled not only as\nobjects of disciplines but also as self-scrutinizing and\nself-forming subjects.\n\nFoucault shows how sexuality becomes an essential construct in\ndetermining not only moral worth, but also health, desire, and\nidentity. Subjects are further obligated to tell the truth about\nthemselves by confessing the details of their sexuality. Foucault\nargued that modern sexuality was characterized by the secularization\nof religious techniques of confession: one no longer confesses the\ndetails of one\u2019s sexual desire to a priest; one goes to a\ndoctor, a therapist, a psychologist, or a psychiatrist.\n\nThe book begins with a repudiation of the \u201crepressive\nhypothesis,\u201d the idea that sexuality in the Victorian era was\nrepressed and discourse on it silenced. Foucault claims that\nrepression did not characterize the primary attitude of modern society\ntowards sex; rather, sexuality became the object of new kinds of\ndiscourse\u2014medical, juridical and psychological \u00ad\u2013 and\nthat discourse on it actually increased. Sexuality was inextricably\nlinked to truth: these new discourses were able to tell us the\nscientific truth about ourselves through our sexuality.\n\nAlthough the book is a historical study of the emergence of modern\nsexuality in the nineteenth century, Foucault\u2019s targets were\nalso contemporary ideas and practices. The prevalent views on\nsexuality in the 1960s and 1970s held that there was a natural and\nhealthy sexuality that all human beings shared simply in virtue of\nbeing human, and this sexuality was presently repressed by cultural\nprohibitions and conventions such as bourgeois morality and capitalist\nsocio-economic structures. Repressed sexuality was the cause of\nvarious neuroses and it was important to have an active and free\nsexuality. The popular discourse on sexuality thus fervently argued\nfor sexual liberation: we had to liberate our true sexuality from the\nrepressive mechanisms of power.\n\nFoucault challenged this view by showing how our conceptions and\nexperiences of sexuality are in fact always the result of specific\ncultural conventions and mechanisms of power and could not exist\nindependently of them. The mission to liberate our repressed sexuality\nwas thus fundamentally misguided because there was no authentic or\nnatural sexuality to liberate. To free oneself from one set of norms\nonly meant adopting different norms in their stead, and that could\nturn out to be just as controlling and normalizing. He wrote mockingly\nthat the irony of our endless preoccupation with sexuality was that we\nbelieved that it had something to do with our liberation.\n\nIn order to challenge the dominant view of the relationship between\nsexuality and repressive power, Foucault had to re-conceive the nature\nof power. His major claim is that power is not essentially repressive\nbut productive. It does not operate by repressing and prohibiting the\ntrue and authentic expressions of a natural sexuality. Instead it\nproduces, through cultural normative practices and scientific\ndiscourses, the ways in which we experience and conceive of our\nsexuality. Power relations are \u201cthe internal conditions\u201d\nof our sexual identities.\n\nFoucault outlined what became one of the most influential contemporary\nunderstandings of power in a series of short propositions over three\npages of The History of Sexuality, Volume 1. He elucidated\nand developed this understanding of power in a number of essays,\nlectures and interviews throughout the rest of his life, but the basic\nidea was already present in these pages. We should not try to look for\nthe center of power, or for the individuals, institutions or classes\nthat rule, but should rather construct a \u201cmicrophysics of\npower\u201d that focuses on the multitude of loci of power spread\nthroughout a society: families, workplaces, everyday practices, and\nmarginal institutions. One has to analyze power relations from the\nbottom up and not from the top down, and to study the myriad ways in\nwhich the subjects themselves are constituted in these diverse but\nintersecting networks.\n\nAlthough dispersed among various interlacing networks throughout\nsociety, power nevertheless has a rationality, a series of aims and\nobjectives, and the means of attaining them. This does not imply that\nany individual has consciously formulated them. As the example of the\nPanopticon shows, power often functions according to a clear\nrationality irrespective of the intentions and motives of the\nindividual who guards the prison from the tower. Despite the\ncentrality of the Panopticon as a model for power, Foucault does not\nhold that power forms a deterministic system of overbearing\nconstraints. Power should rather be understood and analyzed as an\nunstable network of practices implying that where there is power,\nthere is always resistance too. Just as there is no center of power,\nthere is no center of resistance somewhere outside of it. Resistance\nis rather inherent in power relations and their dynamics, it is\n\u201cthe odd term in the relations of power\u201d (1976 [1978:\n96]). While power relations permeate the whole body of society, they\nmay be denser in some regions and less dense in others.\n\nFoucault\u2019s short but influential discussion of biopower also\nfirst appears at the end of The History of Sexuality, Vol. 1.\nFoucault contrasts it to what he calls sovereign power: a form of\npower that was historically founded on violence\u2014the right to\nkill. It was exercised mainly by \u201cdeduction\u201d (taking\nsomething away): it consisted of the right to appropriate a portion of\nthe nation\u2019s wealth, for example by imposing a tax on products,\ngoods and services, or by demanding a portion of the subjects\u2019\ntime, strength, and ultimately life itself. The obligation to wage war\non behalf of the sovereign and the imposition of death penalty for\ngoing against his will were the clearest forms of such power. But\nFoucault claims that the West has undergone a profound transformation\nin its mechanisms of power since the seventeenth century. Deductive\nand violent sovereign power has been gradually complemented and partly\nreplaced by biopower, a form of power that exerts a positive influence\non life, \u201cthat endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply\nit, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive\nregulations\u201d (1976 [1978: 137]). This era of biopower is marked\nby the explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the\ncontrol of populations: techniques that, for example, coordinate\nmedical care, normalize behavior, rationalize mechanisms of insurance,\nand rethink urban planning. The aim is the effective administration of\nbodies and the calculated management of life through means that are\nscientific and continuous. Mechanisms of power and knowledge have\nassumed responsibility for the life process in order to optimize,\ncontrol, and modify it. The exercise of power over living beings no\nlonger carries the threat of death, but instead takes charge of their\nlives.\n\nThe rationality of biopower is markedly different from that of\nsovereign power in terms not just of its objectives, but also of its\ninstruments. A major consequence of its development is the growing\nimportance of norms at the expense of the juridical system of the law.\nFoucault claims that the dominance of biopower as the paradigmatic\nform of power means that we live in a society in which the power of\nthe law has subsided in favor of regulative and corrective mechanisms\nbased on scientific knowledge. Biopower penetrates traditional forms\nof political power, but it is essentially the power of experts and\nadministrators.\n\nThe genealogical attempt to historicize the body is prominent also in\nThe History of Sexuality, Vol. 1, but now Foucault\u2019s\ntarget is the naturalist explanations of sex and sexuality. At the end\nof the book Foucault takes up the question of whether we can find a\nscientific truth about sex. He makes clear that his genealogical\ninvestigation of sexuality implies a challenge to a certain kind of\nexplanatory framework of sexuality and gender: the idea of sex as a\nnatural foundation or an unobserved cause, which supports the visible\neffects of gender and sexuality. He critically appraises the idea of a\nnatural, scientifically defined true sex by revealing the historical\ndevelopment of this form of thought. He does not claim that sex,\nunderstood as the categories of maleness and femaleness, was invented\nin a particular historical period. He rather analyses the ways in\nwhich these categories were founded and explained in discourses\nclaiming the status of scientific truth, and how this allegedly\n\u201cpure\u201d explanation in fact constituted these categories so\nthat they were understood as \u201cnatural.\u201d This idea has had\nenormous influence on feminist philosophers and queer theorists.\nJudith Butler has appropriated this idea in her influential book\nGender Trouble to argue that allegedly scientific ideas of\nsex as a natural and necessary ground for sexual and gendered\nidentities in fact have a normative function: they constitute our\nconceptions of \u201cnormal\u201d men and women and their\n\u201cnatural\u201d sexual desire for each other.\n3.6 Sex in the Ancient World\n\nFoucault\u2019s final engagement with traditional philosophy arises\nfrom the turn toward the ancient world he took in the last few years\nof his life. The History of Sexuality had been planned as a\nmulti-volume work on various themes in a study of modern sexuality.\nThe first volume, discussed above, was a general introduction.\nFoucault wrote a second volume (Les aveux de la chair) that\ndealt with the origins of the modern notion of the subject in the\npractices of Christian confession, but he never published it. (It was\npublished posthumously in 2018.) His concern was that a proper\nunderstanding of the Christian development required a comparison with\nancient conceptions of the ethical self, something he undertook in his\nlast two books (1984) on Greek and Roman sexuality: The Use of\nPleasure and The Care of the Self.\n\nThese treatments of ancient sexuality moved Foucault into ethical\nissues that had been implicit but seldom explicitly thematized in his\nearlier writings. What emerges out of his historical studies of\nancient sexuality is a particular conception of ethics that he traces\nto antiquity. In the ancient conception, ethics referred to the\npractice through which one forms oneself as an ethical subject\nfollowing the prescriptive elements of morality. It concerns the way\nin which moral rules can be adopted and problematized by the subjects\nthemselves.\n\nThe importance of a study of ethics becomes apparent when we try to\nmake visible the difference between the morality of antiquity and that\nof Christianity. Foucault\u2019s specific goal was to compare ancient\npagan and Christian ethics through the test-case of sexuality and to\ntrace the development of Christian ideas about sex from the very\ndifferent ideas of the ancients. He argues that, contrary to what is\noften believed, on the level of moral codes of behavior, there are in\nfact striking similarities between antiquity and Christianity. Both\nshared, for example, a concern that sexual expenditure could harm an\nindividual\u2019s health, and they both valued conjugal fidelity and\nsexual abstinence. But there was a strong contrast in the ways these\ntwo cultures understood and practiced these ideals and demands.\n\nIn the Christian view sexual acts were, on the whole, evil in\nthemselves and most forms of sexual activity were simply forbidden. A\nmain emphasis in Christian morality is therefore on the moral code,\nits systematicity, its richness, and its capacity to adjust to every\npossible case and to embrace every area of behavior. The rules in\nChristian monasteries, for example, were not only very severe, but\nalso extremely detailed. In the morality of antiquity, on the other\nhand, the code and rules of behavior were rudimentary. The ancient\nGreeks\u2019 view was that sexual acts were natural and necessary,\nbut subject to abuse. They emphasized the proper use\n(chresis) of pleasures, where this involved engaging in a\nrange of sexual activities (heterosexual, homosexual, in marriage, out\nof marriage), but with proper moderation. Their texts discussing\nmorality therefore lay down very few explicit rules or guidelines on\nthe kinds of sexual acts that one should engage in. More important\nthan the moral rules was the relationship that one had with oneself,\nthe choice of the \u201cstyle of existence\u201d made by the\nindividual. Sexual austerity, for example, was not practiced as a\nresult of prohibitions, but because of a personal choice to live a\nbeautiful life and to leave to others memories of a beautiful\nexistence. Sex for the Greeks was a major part of what Foucault called\nan \u201caesthetics of existence\u201d: the self\u2019s creation of\na beautiful and enjoyable existence (The Use of Pleasure,\n[1985: 12]).\n\nFoucault\u2019s last two books are an attempt to make a contribution\nto the task of rethinking ethics, but they are also a continuation of\nhis attempt to rethink the subject. Now the focus is on the forms of\nunderstanding that subjects create about themselves and the practices\nby which they transform their mode of being. In his study of ancient\nGreek ethics, Foucault continued to pursue his idea that there was no\ntrue self that could be deciphered and emancipated, but that the self\nwas something that had been\u2014and must be\u2014created. There is,\nhowever, a whole new axis of analysis present in his late studies of\nthe subject. While his earlier genealogical studies investigated the\nways in which power/knowledge networks constituted the subject, his\nlate work emphasizes the subject\u2019s own role in this process. It\ntherefore offers a more complex understanding of the subject. Subjects\nare not simply constructed by power; they themselves partake in that\nconstruction and modify themselves through practices of the self. They\nare not just docile bodies, but actively refuse, adopt and alter forms\nof being a subject. One way of contesting normalizing power is by\nshaping oneself and one\u2019s lifestyle creatively: by exploring\nopportunities for new ways of being, new fields of experience,\npleasures, relationships, modes of living and thinking.\n4. Foucault after Foucault\n\nFoucault left instructions that there should be no posthumous\npublication of his writings that he had not published in his lifetime.\nBut Foucault had allowed taping of his lectures, and his estate\ndecided that this amounted to permission to publish edited versions of\nhis public lectures based on his notes and tape recordings. This\ndecision has allowed print editions of the annual courses of lectures\nthat he delivered at the Coll\u00e8ge de France from 1970\u201371\nthrough 1983\u201384 (except for a sabbatical year in 1976\u201377)\nas well as other lectures he gave in different universities around the\nworld. This has made an enormous body of important material available.\nSome of it covers work later published, but some presents ideas that\nappear nowhere else.\n\nThe lecture series Security, Territory, Population\n(1977\u20131978) and The Birth of Biopolitics\n(1978\u20131979) have been especially influential and introduce\nFoucault\u2019s ideas on government and\ngovernmentality. \u201cGovernment\u201d becomes\nFoucault\u2019s preferred term for power, while\n\u201cgovernmentality\u201d functions as his main theoretical tool\nfor analyzing its rationality, techniques, and procedures in the\nmodern world.\n\nFoucault shows that while government historically referred to a wide\nrange of practices, from religious guidance of the soul to ruling over\na territory and its inhabitants, in the context of the modern state it\nhas come to mean governing a population. Population as the object of\nmodern forms of government both required and encouraged the\ndevelopment of specific forms of knowledge such as statistical\nanalysis as well as macro-economic and bio-scientific knowledge. The\nmodern state had to take care of the life and the wellbeing of its\npopulation, and Foucault therefore calls the politics of the modern\nstate biopolitics.\n\nIn Foucault\u2019s original formulation, the term\n\u201cgovernmentality\u201d referred to the specific historical\ndevelopment of the essentially modern, complex techniques of power\nthat focused on the population. Later Foucault also gave the term a\nmore general meaning as \u201cthe way in which one conducts the\nconduct of men\u201d (The Birth of Biopolitics, [2008:\n186]). His key claim was that to understand the practice of government\nin this broad sense of controlling people\u2019s conduct, one had to\nstudy the specific technologies of power, but also the rationality\nunderpinning them. The practices and institutions of government are\nalways enabled, regulated, and justified by a specific form of\nreasoning or rationality that defines their ends and the suitable\nmeans of achieving them. To understand power as a set of relations, as\nFoucault repeatedly suggested, means understanding how such relations\nare reflected on and rationalized. It means examining how forms of\nrationality inscribe themselves in practices and systems of practices,\nand what role they play within them.\n\nThe exposition and analysis of the historically changing governmental\nrationalities was a pivotal goal of Foucault\u2019s lectures. His\nanalysis makes clear that modern governmental rationality has two\nmajor features. On the one hand, the development of the modern state\nis characterized by the centralization of political power: a\ncentralized state with highly organized administration and bureaucracy\nhas emerged. While this feature is commonly analyzed and also\ncriticized in political thought, Foucault also identifies the\nevolution of a second feature that appears to be antagonistic to this\ndevelopment. He claims that the modern state is also characterized by\nindividualizing power\u2014or \u201cpastoral power\u201d as he also\ncalls it. This is power that relies on individualizing knowledge about\na person\u2019 life. The modern state required the development of\npower technologies oriented towards individuals in an attempt to\ngovern their conduct in a continuous and permanent way. The result is\nthe intervention of the state in the everyday life of individuals for\nexample, their diet, mental health, and sexual practices.\n\nThe analysis of governmentality does not replace Foucault\u2019s\nearlier understanding of power. His method of analysis is similar to\nthe one he used to study the techniques and practices of power in the\ncontext of particular, local institutions such as the prison. What had\nto be analyzed, but also questioned, were the historically specific\nrationalities intrinsic to practices. At the same time,\nFoucault\u2019s analysis of governmentality adds new and important\ndimensions to his understanding of power. While his studies of\ndisciplinary power were restricted to specialized institutional\ncontexts, with the notion of government he was able to study larger,\nstrategic developments beyond the scope of his \u201cmicrophysics of\npower.\u201d He was able to transfer his understanding of power to\ndomains such as the state that were traditionally regarded as objects\nof political theory. With the idea of power as government, Foucault\nwas also able to clarify his understanding of resistance. Because\ngovernment refers to strategic, regulated and rationalized modes of\npower that have to be legitimized through forms of knowledge, the idea\nof critique as a form of resistance now becomes crucial. To govern is\nnot to physically determine the conduct of passive objects. Government\ninvolves offering reasons why those governed should do what they are\ntold, and this implies that they can also question these reasons.\nFoucault claims that this is why governmentality has historically\ndeveloped in tandem with the practice of political critique. The\npractice of critique must question the reasons for governing like\nthat: the legitimate principles, procedures and means of\ngoverning.\n\nIn the lecture series The Birth of Biopolitics, Foucault also\nengages in a lengthy examination of neoliberal governmentality. This\nanalysis has become seminal for contemporary political theory. Many\npolitical commentators now see the year 1979, when Foucault delivered\nhis lectures, as the inauguration of the dominance of neoliberal\neconomic policy in Europe and the United States. Almost forty years\nafter its expanding application, Foucault\u2019s topic and his\ninsights appear farsighted. His analysis of neoliberalism is\ndistinctive in at least two significant ways. First, he analyzes\nneoliberalism as a historically novel form of governmentality\u2014a\nrationality of governing connected with specific technologies of\npower. On Foucault\u2019s account neoliberalism is not understood\njust as an economic doctrine, but as a governmental form that is\ndirected toward specific objectives, regulates itself through\ncontinuous reflection, and, essentially, aims to ensure that\ncapitalism works. It also comprises a coherent political ontology, a\nset of philosophical background beliefs about the nature of society,\nmarkets, and human beings. However, it is not an ideology in the sense\nof consisting only of ideas or false beliefs. Its political ontology\nnecessitates and rationalizes a specific technology of\npower\u2014specific practices of governing, as well as a particular\nway of reflecting on and problematizing these practices.\n\nFoucault also emphasizes that neoliberal governmentality should be\nviewed as a particular way of producing subjects: it produces an\neconomic subject structured by specific tendencies, preferences, and\nmotivations. It aims to create social conditions that not only\nencourage and necessitate competitiveness and self-interest, but also\nproduce them. Foucault discusses the work of the American neoliberal\neconomists, in particular Gary Becker and his theory of human capital,\nin order to show how neoliberal subjects are understood as navigating\nthe social realm by constantly making rational choices based on\neconomic knowledge and the strict calculation of the necessary costs\nand desired benefits. Such subjects must make long-term and short-term\ninvestments in different aspects of their lives and acquire sufficient\neconomic knowledge to be able to calculate costs, risks, and possible\nreturns on the capital invested.\n\nFoucault never published any of the material developed in these two\nlecture series, and in the lectures in the 1980s he turned to examine\ntexts from ancient philosophy. Many of the ideas developed there were\nlater published as The Use of Pleasure and Care of the\nSelf. His studies of ancient sexuality, and, particularly, the\nidea of an aesthetics of existence also led him to the ancient idea of\nphilosophy as a way of life rather than a search for theoretical\ntruth. Although The Use of Pleasure has some discussion of\nPlato\u2019s conception of philosophy, Foucault\u2019s treatments of\nthe topic are primarily in lectures that he had no time to develop for\npublication. Some of these lectures discuss Socrates (in the\nApology and in Alcibiades I) as both a model and an\nexponent of a philosophical life focused on \u201ccare of the\nself\u201d and follow the subsequent ancient discussions of this\ntopic in, for example, Epictetus, Seneca, and Plutarch. Other lectures\ndeal with the ancient ideal of \u201ctruthful speaking\u201d\n(parrhesia), regarded as a central political and moral\nvirtue. Here Foucault discusses earlier formulations of the notion, in\nEuripides and Socrates, as well as its later transformations by the\nEpicureans, Stoics, and Cynics. This research project might have been\none of the most fruitful of all Foucault\u2019s engagements with\ntraditional philosophy. But his early death in 1984 prevented him from\ncompleting it.",
