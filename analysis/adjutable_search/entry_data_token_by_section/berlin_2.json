    "main_text": "Philosophy of Knowledge and the Humanities || Conception of Philosophy\n2.1 Conception of Philosophy\n\nBerlin\u2019s conception of philosophy was shaped by his early\nexposure to, and rejection of, both Idealism and logical\n positivism.[1]\n With the former he associated an excessively exalted view of\nphilosophy as the \u2018queen of the sciences\u2019, capable of\nestablishing fundamental, necessary, absolute, universal truths. With\nthe latter he associated the reductionist and deflationary view of\nphilosophy as, at best, a handmaiden to the sciences, and at worst a\nsign of intellectual immaturity bred of scientistic confusion and\ncredulity.\n\nBerlin\u2019s approach combined a sceptical empiricism with\nneo-Kantianism to offer a defence of philosophy. Like Vico and Wilhelm\nDilthey, as well as neo-Kantians such as Heinrich Rickert and Wilhelm\nWindelband, Berlin insisted on the fundamental difference between the\nsciences and the humanities. He classed philosophy among the\nhumanities, but even there its status was unique. Those working in\nother fields aimed to discover authoritative methods for acquiring\nknowledge of the subjects to which they were devoted. Philosophy,\nhowever, was for Berlin concerned with questions which not only could\nnot at present be answered, but for which no clearly proper method of\ndiscovering an answer was known (see e.g. \u2018The Purpose of\nPhilosophy\u2019 in 1978b and 2000a).\n\nIn the case of non-philosophical questions, even if the answer is\nunknown, the means for discovering the answer is known, or accepted,\nby most people. Thus questions of empirical fact can be answered by\nobservation. Other questions can be answered deductively, by referring\nto established rules: this is the case, for example, with mathematics,\ngrammar and formal logic. For example, even if we do not know the\nsolution to a difficult mathematical problem, we do know the rules and\ntechniques that should lead us to the answer.\n\nAccording to Berlin, philosophy concerns itself with questions of a\nspecial, distinctive character. To such questions not only are the\nanswers not known, but neither are the means for arriving at answers,\nor the standards of judgement by which to evaluate a suggested answer.\nThus the questions \u2018How long does it take to drive from\nx to y?\u2019 or \u2018What is the cube root of\n729?\u2019 are not philosophical; while \u2018What is time?\u2019\nor \u2018What is a number?\u2019 are. \u2018What is the purpose of\nhuman life?\u2019 or \u2018Are all men brothers?\u2019 are\nphilosophical questions, while \u2018Do most of such-and-such a group\nof men think of one another as brothers?\u2019 or \u2018What did\nLuther believe was the purpose of life?\u2019 are not.\n\nBerlin related this view to Kant\u2019s distinction between matters\nof fact and those conceptual structures and categories that we use to\nmake sense of facts. Philosophy, being concerned with questions that\narise from our attempts to make sense of our experiences, involves\nconsideration of the concepts and categories through which experience\nis perceived, organised and explained.\n\nWhile Kant saw these organising categories as fixed and universal,\nBerlin believed that they are, to different degrees, varying,\ntransient or malleable. \u2018All our categories are, in theory,\nsubject to change\u2019 (2002b, 144, note 1). No categories are\nwholly prior to, or independent of, experience, even though in\npractice some of them are pragmatically fixed, whether by the world or\nby our minds or both. Rather, the ideas in terms of which we make\nsense of the world are closely tied up with our experiences: they\nshape those experiences, and are shaped by them, and as experience\nvaries from one time and place to another, so do basic\n concepts.[2]\n Recognition of the basic concepts and categories of human experience\ndiffers both from the acquisition of empirical information and from\ndeductive reasoning, for the categories are logically prior to,\npresupposed by, both.\n\nPhilosophy, then, is the study of the \u2018thought-spectacles\u2019\nthrough which we view the world; and since at least some of these\nchange over time, at least some philosophy is necessarily historical.\nBecause these categories are so important to every aspect of our\nexperience, philosophy \u2013 even if it is always tentative and\noften seems abstract and esoteric \u2013 is a crucially important\nactivity, which responds to the vital, ineradicable human need to\ndescribe and explain the world of experience.\n\nBerlin insisted on philosophy\u2019s social usefulness, however\nindirect and\n unobtrusive.[3]\n By bringing to light often subconscious presuppositions and models,\nand scrutinising their validity, philosophy identifies errors and\nconfusions that lead to misunderstanding, distort experience, and thus\ndo real harm. Because philosophy calls commonly accepted assumptions\ninto question, it is inherently subversive, opposed to all orthodoxy,\nand often troubling; but this is inseparable from what makes\nphilosophy valuable, and indeed indispensable, as well as liberating.\nPhilosophy\u2019s goal, Berlin concluded, was \u2018to assist men to\nunderstand themselves and thus operate in the open, and not wildly, in\nthe dark\u2019 (1978b, 14).\n",
