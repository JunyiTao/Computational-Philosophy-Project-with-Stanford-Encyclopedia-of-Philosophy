A painting might be\nevaluated in terms of beauty: is it \u201cbeautiful\u201d,\n\u201cneutral\u201d, or \u201cugly\u201d? An academic applicant\nmight be graded in terms of research skills. Let \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) be a\nfinite set of possible grades, linearly ordered from\n\u201chighest\u201d to \u201clowest\u201d. The state\n\\(\\mathbf{s}\\) is the true value or grade in \\(\\mathcal{A}\\)\n(\\(=\\mathcal{S}\\)). Each group member assigns a grade. The resulting\ngrading profile \\((a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\) is aggregated into the\nmedian grade \\(a=F(a_{1},\\ldots,a_{n})\\), i.e., the middle\ngrade after putting \\(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\) into a weakly increasing\norder \\(a_{1}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, a_{n}^{\\prime}\\) (to ensure medians\nexist, let \\(n\\) be odd). If, for instance, a painting is evaluated\ntwice as \u201cbeautiful\u201d and once as \u201cugly\u201d, where\n\\(n=3\\), then the median evaluation is \u201cbeautiful\u201d. Given\nan instance \\(s\\) of the state, consider a voter \\(i\\)\u2019s\ncorrectness probability \\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}=s|s)\\), over-valuation\nprobability \\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}>s|s)\\), and under-valuation\nprobability \\(P(\\mathbf{v}_{i}<s|s)\\). The absolute difference\nbetween the over- and under-valuation probability defines\n\\(i\\)\u2019s bias, i.e., tendency to over- or under-value.\nMorreau (2021) proves a \u201cgrading-jury theorem\u201d: if,\nconditional on any state, the grades\n\\(\\mathbf{v}_{1},\\mathbf{v}_{2},\\ldots\\) are (i) independent, (ii)\nhomogeneously distributed, and (iii) sufficiently unbiased (i.e., with\nbias below the correctness probability), then the correctness\nprobability of the median evaluation increases in (odd) group size and\nconverges to\n certainty.[30]\n The correctness probability can become very small, provided it\nexceeds the bias. Having small bias seems particularly difficult if\nthe true value is very high or very low, since extreme values are\neasily under- or over-estimated.\n",
