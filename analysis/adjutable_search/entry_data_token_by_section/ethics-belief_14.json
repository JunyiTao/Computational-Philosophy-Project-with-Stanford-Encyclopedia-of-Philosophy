    "main_text": "Varieties of Evidentialism || Prudential evidentialism\n5.1 Prudential evidentialism\n\nStrict prudential Evidentialism doesn't enjoy much of a\nfollowing; indeed, as with most strict forms of Evidentialism, it is\nhard to see how it could be motivated. Perhaps it is prudent in\ngeneral to follow one's evidence, but there will always be cases\nin which prudential considerations push in the direction of playing\nfast and loose with the evidence. Wouldn't it be better for the\ngrief-stricken widower to believe that his wife is enjoying life in\nheaven, or for the devoted spouse to fight off the belief that her\nhusband is unfaithful, even though she regularly finds lipstick on his\ncollar?\n\nOne move that the prudential Evidentialist can make in response to\nsuch objections is to adopt the doxastic analogue of rule\nconsequentialism. Even if there are particular cases in which it is\nimprudent to follow one's evidence, the general rule that one\nshould believe on the basis of, and in proportion to, sufficient\nevidence in one's possession produces the best distribution of\nprudential outcomes overall.\n\nThis kind of moderate prudential Evidentialism can handle a lot of\ncommon counterexamples, but there is still the concern that entire\nclasses of beliefs\u2014rather than individual\ninstances\u2014violate the principle and yet seem to produce more\nbeneficial overall results. For instance, wouldn't it be better all\naround if each of us were as a rule to think more highly of\none another's worth, intentions, and capacities than our evidence\nactually supports?\n\nIn response, it might be claimed that the source of the prudential\nvalue of always believing on sufficient evidence is that it tends to\nresult in our having knowledge. If that were right, then there would\nbe a clear connection between prudential and epistemic norms (see\n\u00a72.4 above and \u00a75.3 below). The challenge for such a\nposition, however, is to show that justification or knowledge adds\nsomething of genuine prudential value that mere true belief\nlacks.\n",
