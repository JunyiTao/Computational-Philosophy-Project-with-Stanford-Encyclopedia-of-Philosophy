    "main_text": "\n\n\nPerceptual experiences are often divided into the following three\nbroad categories: veridical perceptions, illusions, and\nhallucinations.  For example, when one has a visual experience as of a\nred object, it may be that one is really seeing an object and its red\ncolour (veridical perception), that one is seeing a green object\n(illusion), or that one is not seeing an object at all\n(hallucination). Many maintain that the same account should be given\nof the nature of the conscious experience that occurs in each of these\nthree cases. Those who hold a disjunctive theory of perception deny\nthis. Disjunctivists typically reject the claim that the same kind of\nexperience is common to all three cases because they hold views about\nthe nature of veridical perception that are inconsistent with it.\n\n\nDisjunctivists are often na\u00efve realists, who hold that when one\nperceives the world, the mind-independent objects of perception, such\nas tables and trees, are constituents of one\u2019s experience. In other\ncases, such as hallucinations, it seems out of the question that such\nobjects are constituents of one\u2019s experience. It follows that on a\nna\u00efve realist view, the veridical perceptions and hallucinations\nin question have a different nature: the former have mind-independent\nobjects as constituents, and the latter do not.\n",
