    "main_text": "God and the universe: creation and conservation/maintenance of the universe || God\u2019s conservation of the universe\n3.2 God\u2019s conservation of the universe\n\nMuslim theologians and most, but not all, Muslim philosophers agreed\nthat the world cannot conserve its own existence and so its existence\nat every moment that it exists is in some way dependent upon God. The\nreal issue for these thinkers is what role, if any, do creatures play\nin the ongoing processes that constitute the world? Specifically, do\nor can creatures have causal powers or is God not merely the Cause of\ncauses but the only Cause? Broadly, there were three responses to this\nquestion: that of the philosophers, which appeals to their theories of\nessential causation in the form of emanation and natural causation\namong creatures; that of the Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, which tends\ntoward divine occasionalism yet reserved some causal efficacy for\nrational agents; and that of the Ash\u02bfarites and Maturidite\ntheologians, which is also occasionalist, but reserves all or at least\nvirtually all causal efficacy for God alone. Here we focus primarily\non the philosophers\u2019 theory of essential causation and the\ntheory of occasionalism that the theologians shared.\n3.2.1 Essential causation and providence\n\nPhilosophers such as Kind\u012b, F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd all adopted some form of essential or\nnatural causation, some more influenced by the Neoplatonic\nemanationist framework, others less influenced by that framework\n(Kind\u012b RKF: 214\u201337 = MR07: 1\u201316;\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, ch. 8; Avicenna PhysH:\nbk. 1.5 (= MR07: 156\u201363) & 1.9\u201312 and Ibn Rushd\nMetaphysics, 105\u201312 & Questions,\n11\u201314). (Ibn Rushd explicitly rejected emanation, whether from\nGod or from creatures, while allowing that creatures have natural\ncausal powers, i.e., that their natures were the source of actions\nthat are strictly speaking their own; see Kogan 1985, esp. ch. 3 and\n5.) For present purposes, we focus on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nemanationist-influenced theory of causation, since it would become\nboth the preferred approach of supporters as well as the preferred\ntarget of detractors in the post-Avicennan period. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s proof for the existence of the Necessary\nExistent through itself is set up in terms of explaining the existence\nof the whole of all possible/contingent things that exist at any given\nmoment. Given its setup, that proof likewise shows that the\nworld\u2014understood as all the possible things that have, presently\ndo or will exist\u2014is dependent upon God as that which conserves\nit in existence at every moment that the world exists. The causal\nmechanism explaining this dependency relation again is emanation,\nwhere, on Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s own unique theory of emanation,\nit is a possible existent that emanates from the Necessary Existent in\nitself.\n\nHere it is worth noting that for many philosophers, while ultimately\neverything in the world traces its existence back to the divine\nemanation, God is not the immediate cause of everything.\nInstead, God is only the immediate cause of a single effect,\nidentified with the First Intellect. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 is adamant on\nthis point: \u2018From the One only one proceeds\u2019 (Avicenna\nMetaH: 9.4 [5]; also see Amin 2020 and Dadikhuda 2020). Still, from\nthat one effect a plethora of effects, i.e., other possible existents,\ncascade downward, all of which are mediately but ultimately dependent\non God for their conservation and their continued existence at every\nmoment that they exist. In other words, the created order overflows\nfrom the Necessary Existent in coherent grades of existents, namely, a\nhierarchy of immaterial creatures, like intellects or angels, followed\nby the material realm. In each case the higher-grade functions as the\nimmediate causal principle of the next lower grade.\n\nThis emanationist cosmology is rooted in the Neoplatonic principle\nthat \u201cevery activity in the world is in some sense double\ninsofar as it possesses both an inner and an outer aspect\u201d (see\nentry on\n neoplatonism).\n The inner aspect is the thing\u2019s nature, which is the principle\nand cause of those activities that are essential to being a certain\nkind of thing. For example, the inner activity of a tree, which the\ntree\u2019s nature determines, gives rise to its producing the shape,\nleaves, fruit etc. specific to that kind of tree. Another common\nexample is fire\u2019s burning cotton, for fire\u2019s nature is to\nburn, while cotton is of a nature that when in contact with fire, the\ncotton is burnt. Our world, for the philosophers, then, is a network\nof possible existents each having causal powers specific to their\nkind, all of which are ultimately dependent upon God for their\nexistence.\n\nFinally, while Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 insists that God is not acting with\nthe intention of the world\u2019s good, our world still is the\nbeneficiary of God\u2019s providence. That is because in knowing\nhimself God knows the order of the good in the most perfectly possible\nway, and God\u2019s self-knowledge, as seen in the discussion of Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s account of creations (see\n \u00a73.1.1),\n is his very act of emanation. Consequently, what emanates from him is\nan order that is the most perfectly possible commensurate with the\nchain of possible existents. This optimal ordering of existents, whose\nreality is grounded in the Necessary Existent, just is, for Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101, providence (\u02bfin\u0101ya).\n\nHere it is certainly worth noting that, for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, and\nothers like F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn Rushd (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b\nPerfect State, \u00a7\u00a76\u20137, Avicenna MetaH: 8.6\n[6]\u20138.7 and Ibn Rushd Metaphysics ad Textus\n51), God does not know particulars in their particularity, e.g., that\nyou are reading this sentence at this very moment; rather, God knows\nparticulars only universally. Moreover, God does not act for our sake\nsuch that our good is the final end of God\u2019s creative act, even\nthought we are the benefactors of the divine goodness\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Siy\u0101sa, 47\u20138 = MR07:\n91\u20132 [\u00b6\u00b6 31\u20132]; Avicenna MetaH: 8.3 [1\u20133]\n& al-Naj\u0101t, 146\u20139 = MR07: 216\u201319 and Ibn\nRushd Metaphysics ad Textus 52). Despite these\ncaveats, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 believes that God\u2019s universal\nknowledge is sufficient to ensure that\n\n\nnot even the weight of a dust speck, whether in the heavens or on the\nEarth, escapes your Lord\u2019s notice (Qur\u2019an 10:61).\n(Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t, 247 = MR07: 217).\n\n\nThus by Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s lights divine providence is still\nensured. Ibn Rushd makes a similar point about divine providence (Ibn\nRushd Metaphysics ad Textus 52).\n3.2.2 Occasionalism\n\nMany Muslim theologians viewed the philosophers\u2019 idea of natures\nwith causal powers as one that impugned God\u2019s omnipotence and\nhis divine sovereignty over all that is. In addition, they found the\nphilosophers\u2019 argumentation for essential or natural causation\nwanting. First, Muslim theologians were not impressed with either the\ntheory of emanation or the philosophers\u2019 account of essential or\nnatural causation. In the Incoherence of the Philosophers,\nafter faithfully presenting the philosophers\u2019 discussion of\nemanation, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b says,\n\n\nWhat they have said is arbitrary and really just shadows in the dark.\nWere someone to utter this while dreaming, we would think they were\ndelirious! (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 3 [48])\n\n\nAs for the philosophers\u2019 theory of natures and natural\ncausation, even before Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, Ab\u016b Bakr\nal-B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b (d. 1013), a rough contemporary of Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101\u2019s and whom Ghaz\u0101l\u012b subsequently\nfollows, challenged the philosophers\u2019 account of natures\n(B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd, 34\u201347 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 17). These theologians\nnote that the philosophers\u2019 reason for insisting on natures with\ncausal powers and natural necessitation is purportedly drawn from\nempirical observations: One regularly observes, for example,\nfire\u2019s contact with cotton and the burning of the cotton or the\nimbibing of alcohol and the intoxication of the imbiber and a\nmultitude of other such regularities. The philosophers maintain that\nthese regularities require that the nature of fire, for example,\ncauses the cotton to burn because the nature of cotton is to be so\naffected and similarly for the rest of regularities in the natural\norder. B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b and Ghaz\u0101l\u012b push back on\nthis last assumption. We do not observe causal connections, they note,\nbut merely constant conjunctions: one event followed by another. While\nnatural causation could explain these constant conjunctions,\nGod\u2019s habit (\u02bf\u0101da) or custom of creating a\ngiven event after another could equally explain them.\n\nIn place of natural causation, many Muslim theologians held some\ntheory of occasionalism (Fakhry 1958 and Perler & Rudolph, 2000:\n13\u2013124). For them, God is not simply the Cause of causes, he in\nfact is the only cause. God not merely brought the world into\nexistence at some moment in the past, but indeed at every instance, he\nre-creates the world anew. In its extreme form, there is only the\nillusion of a continuity between moments or a creature\u2019s\npersisting through time. Changes in the world, thus, are solely the\nresult of God\u2019s re-creating the world slightly differently at\neach subsequent moment. Consequently, nothing other than God can truly\nbe an agent of change or action.\n\nSome might find the theologians\u2019 theory of occasionalism\nmetaphysically exotic. For many theologians, it was simply an\nimplication of God\u2019s absolute omnipotence: God truly has\nall power, and so no concession is made to creatures (see\nWolfson 1976: VII.I). Even Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who concedes that humans\nhave a modicum of power, hastens to add that when compared to\nGod\u2019s omnipotence our power resembles impotence\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 99). B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b\nhimself (B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd,\n34\u201347) has a more philosophically rather than theologically\nengaged answer. He argues that occasionalism is metaphysically\npreferable to the theory of natural causation on the grounds of a\nPrinciple of Paucity: Given two theories each of which equally well\nexplains the same phenomena, the simpler theory should be preferred.\nThe philosophers must posit at least two ontologically distinct kinds\nof causes: divine causation and natural causation (which itself\nburgeons into a passel of further ontologically distinct kinds of\ncauses). In contrast, occasionalism, B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b\nobserves, needs posit only one kind of cause, God, and so should be\npreferred.\n4. Prophecy and Miracles\n\nAssuming that God exists and stands in some ontological relation with\ncreation, does God, in some way, directly make his will and\nprovidential care known to us? For Muslim theologians and some\nphilosophers, humans receive guidance in how to construct a\nwell-ordered society through the message of prophets. These messages\nare a source of correct beliefs about God, how we should live, our\nplace in the cosmos and our ultimate destiny in the hereafter. Given\nthe centrality of prophecy (nubuwwa) to Islam, two distinct\nquestions faced Muslim philosophers and theologians alike. One is\njustifying and even explaining prophecy as a source of true justified\nbeliefs. The other is identifying a true prophet and distinguishing\nhim from a charlatan, trickster or even sorcerer.\n4.1 Prophecy\n\nConcerning the first issue of justifying and explaining prophecy,\nproponents of prophecy were faced with a challenge. Since humans are\nrational, presumably they can acquire knowledge of reality and the\nrules of conduct regarding their individual and social life on their\nown. Thus, one may ask, \u201cWhy are prophets necessary for\nacquiring true beliefs and proper rules of conduct?\u201d Indeed,\nMuslims did encounter opposition to their belief in prophecy, ranging\nfrom those who claimed it was redundant\u2014at least as the,\nadmittedly hostile, reports about Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b\nrelate\u2014to those who thought it was simply impossible\u2014a\nposition that Muslim theologians ascribed to Ibn al-R\u0101wand\u012b\n(b. ca. 815) and the Bar\u0101hima, arguably the Brahmans of\nIndia (see Stroumsa 1999). Detractors of prophecy formulated the\nproblem regarding the need for prophecy as a dilemma (A. H.\nR\u0101z\u012b Proofs of Prophecy: 24\u20136 &\n131\u20134; Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 165; Nasaf\u012b TA: vol.\nII, 1\u20133). If, on the one hand, that which a prophet teaches on\nthe basis of revelation agrees with that which reason can show, there\nis no need for prophecy. If, on the other hand, that which a prophet\nteaches is inaccessible to reason, then it is not rational, and so to\nbe rejected. The argument continues that it seems impossible that God\nshould act in vain, but if he were to send prophets, he would be\nacting in vain, since the presence of prophets is either redundant or\ntheir message is in a sense irrational.\n\nTheologians and certain Muslim philosophers both wanted to justify and\nto explain prophecy in light of this challenge. Theologians preferred\nto show why, despite the above dilemma, prophecy is possible and not\nvain: If anything, it is a sign of God\u2019s grace. Certain\nphilosophers aimed to show that in addition to prophecy\u2019s being\npossible, there is a natural explanation for it grounded in natural\nphilosophy. While both groups\u2019 approaches are significantly\ndifferent, they share a common feature. Both recognized that human\ncognitive capacities differ and that not all humans are equal with\nregard to those capacities. Indeed, most humans need the symbolic and\nsimplified message of a prophet to reach genuine knowledge of the key\nreligious, ethical and social elements necessary for a devout\nlife.\n\nJuwayn\u012b followed by his student Ghaz\u0101l\u012b are\nrepresentatives of the theologians (Juwayn\u012b\nal-Irsh\u0101d, 302\u20137 = Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n165\u20137 and Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 188\u201395;\nalso see Griffel 2004). For them, it is reasonable that different\nindividuals with different intellectual capacities may know one and\nthe same truth in different ways. One way, however, need not make\nanother way redundant, let alone impossible. Also, even if on their\nown some humans can learn certain specific religious claims, reaching\nthem frequently is difficult and requires a lengthy and diligent\ninquiry, which not all either are willing to do or even capable of\ndoing. Hence, these theologians conclude, it is appropriate, although\nnot obligatory, that God makes such truths available through prophets\nin order that people who do not have the time nor capacity to pursue\nsuch an inquiry still can learn about God and things divine. In this\nrespect, prophecy, far from being vain, is a sign of God\u2019s grace\nand concession to human diversity and weakness.\n\nThe philosophers\u2019 have multiple strategies when treating\nprophecy. For example, Ibn Rushd maintains that while philosophy and\nscience provide the most complete theoretical account of the\nworld and God\u2019s relation to it, prophecy and religion more\ngenerally provide a practical knowledge of what is good and\nright with respect to one\u2019s actions (see Taylor 2018). Ibn Rushd\nmakes this point when identify which kinds of purported miracles are\ngenuine signs of a prophet. He likens a prophet to a physician. If two\nindividuals were both to claim to be physicians, and one says,\n\u201cHere is my proof\u201d, and then walks on water, whereas the\nother heals the sick, it is the latter\u2019s proof that is truly\nrelevant and convincing that he is a physician. Similarly, if two\nindividuals claim to be prophets, and so bearers of a message about\nwhat God wants of us in order to live well and devoutly, and one gives\nas proof some seemingly supernatural act, while the other provides\nlaws and knowledge that actually allow one to live well and devoutly,\nit is the latter who is the genuine prophet (Ibn Rushd\nExpositions, 104\u20135). It is noteworthy that like\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn Rushd distinguishes between philosophers\nand those incapable of grasping philosophical proof. As for prophetic\nmessages, the latter group needs only know that prophecy conveys what\nis necessary for living a religious life, while any theoretical\naccount of prophecy must be withheld from them. The fact is that it is\nunclear whether Ibn Rushd has or even thinks that there can be a\ntheoretical account of prophecy, since in his works exclusively for\nphilosophers (mu\u02beawwal) he is prone to be completely\nsilent or at most raises unanswered puzzles about prophecy.\n\nA theoretical account of prophecy and the mechanism through which it\npurportedly occurs are seen in the works of F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State: ch.\n14 and Avicenna DA: 5.6 = MR07: 204\u20135; also see Walzer 1957 and\nMarmura 1964). Both philosophers would agree with Ibn Rushd that the\nprimary aspect of prophecy and revelation is grounded in the need for\nlaws and political institutions. That is because these laws and\npolitical institutions delineate and support actions directed toward\nthe proper end of humans, namely, happiness or flourishing\n(sa\u02bf\u0101da), which intimately involves a knowledge of\nGod (F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Tanb\u012bh = MR07:\n104\u201320 Avicenna MetaH: 10.2). Unlike Ibn Rushd, they\nadditionally want to provide a theoretical account of prophecy. This\ntheoretical account attempts to show that far from being a\nsupernatural act, as the theologians believe, prophecy is a natural\nphenomenon and as such has a naturalistic explanation. This attempt at\na naturalistic explanation of prophecy is grounded in both their\nemanationist metaphysics and philosophy of mind (see entry on\n Arabic and Islamic psychology and philosophy of mind).\n The details of their positions are complex, so the following is\nsimply to provide a general sense of their strategy.\n\nAs seen, for F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, there\nemanates from God the order of the good in the form of a cascade of\ngrades of dependent or possible existents, each of which can itself be\na source of emanation and a principle of a lower grade. Human\ncognition is itself part of this overflowing: Human intellects receive\nthis emanation once they are suitably prepared and to the extent that\nthey are capable, which in turn perfects the intellects so that they\ncome to have knowledge of our world and God. Next, as noted earlier,\nthe philosophers recognize varying degrees among human cognitive\ncapacities. At the very apex of these varying degrees of capacity is\nthe intellect and imaginative power of prophets. The prophets\u2019\ncognitive powers are wholly and perfectly disposed to receive this\nemanation, and to the greatest extent possible for humans they grasp\nthe divine order of the good as it emanates from God. Moreover, from\ntheir intellects the cascade of emanation continues, now entering into\ntheir imagination such that they sensibly experience as symbols and\nimages what they perfectly know through receiving this ultimately\ndivine emanation. It is these symbols and images that the prophets use\nto convey God\u2019s proverbial plan to those who are otherwise\nincapable of acquiring this knowledge. While the above presentation\noverly emphasizes the \u2018metaphysical\u2019 aspect of their\ntheory of prophecy, the fact is that the bulk of the theory is\ndiscussed and developed in natural philosophy, particularly in works\ncorresponding with Aristotle\u2019s De anima and discussions\nin the novel reworking of the Arabic version of Aristotle\u2019s\nParva Naturalia (for the Arabic verion of the Parva\nNaturalia see Hansberger 2010). In a real sense, the aim is to\nnaturalize prophecy. Thus, prophecy, for these philosophers, is\npossible precisely because it is the natural, even necessary, outcome\nof certain rare, but wholly natural, psychological processes.\n4.2 Miracles\n\nThe second issue again is distinguishing the true prophet from a\ncharlatan, trickster or even sorcerer. If it is reasonable that God\nappoints prophets, the question that immediately arises is how to\nrecognize them and to justify their claims to prophethood. In response\nto this challenge many thinkers in the Islamicate world, theologians\nand philosophers alike, identified performing miracles as a decisive\nsign of one\u2019s rightful claim to being a prophet (\u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 568\u20139; Juwayn\u012b Proofs,\n167\u20138; Ibn F\u016brak Mujarrad Maq\u0101l\u0101t,\n176\u201380; and B\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b al-Tamh\u012bd,\n141\u201360).\n\nThe Arabic term for a prophet\u2019s miracle is\nmu\u02bfjiza, which means that which shows the\nimpotence of others. Specifically, a miracle is a challenge\nby the prophet to others to perform a similar act, which the others\nare presumably incapable of doing. In general, then, a miracle is any\nextraordinary event that confirms an individual\u2019s claims to\nprophethood (Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 168\u201372). Muslims\nrecognize two kinds of such extraordinary events. The first is any\nevent that follows upon the prophet\u2019s challenge and that is\nhighly unexpected albeit not strictly a violation of the natural\norder. For example, the occurrence of a plague, which ensues after the\nprophet predicts it. Also, the very inimitability of the Qur\u2019an\n(i\u02bfj\u0101z) seems to fall within this category and\noften is cited as the only, yet most convincing, proof of\nMuhammad\u2019s claim to prophethood.\n\n\nAnd if you are in any doubt about what we (God) have sent down to our\nservant, produce a s\u016bra of the like of [this\nQur\u2019an]. (Qur\u2019an 2:23; also see 11:13, 10:38, 17:88 and\n52: 34)\n\n\nThose who were so challenged apparently were impotent to rise to the\nchallenge. The second class of extraordinary events requires the\nactual suspension of natural laws. Examples include, the virgin birth\nand the raising of the dead back to life. (Peterson et al. 2013:\n208\u20139). To distinguish this class from the first, let us call\nthem \u2018supernatural\u2019 miracles or events, namely, something\nthat is both extra-ordinary and indeed outside of the natural order of\nthings.\n\nAlthough many, if not most, medieval Islamic scholars acknowledged\nprophetic miracles, the issue of whether there truly were both kinds\nof miracles remained an important topic of discussion. The theologians\nchampioned the position that there are both kinds. The philosophers,\nwhile not denying that extraordinary acts confirm one\u2019s\nprophethood, maintained that although miracles are exceptionally rare,\nthey remain part of the natural order, and so they held a position\nabout miracles much like the naturalized view of prophecy. Let us look\nat the philosophers\u2019 position and then turn to the\ntheologians\u2019 response to it.\n\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s position may be highlighted here (Avicenna\nDA: 198\u2013200 & ITN2: 105; also see Davidson 1992: 121\u20132\nand Al-Akiti 2004). For Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, performing miracles is one\nof three properties that identify a prophet. We have already seen the\nother two, namely, (1) to divine future and/or absent events and (2)\nto relate religious truths in symbolic form that all can grasp. Ibn\nS\u012bn\u0101 explains miracles in much the same way that he explains\nthese other two properties of the prophet. The intellect and\nimagination of prophets are of the highest degree possible for humans,\nand so the prophet fully grasps and understands the order of the good\nthat has its ultimate sources in the divine emanation. Additionally,\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101 recognizes the well-established fact that\none\u2019s mind and emotions can produce psychosomatic responses even\nin people of limited intellectual power; however, while for the most\nparts these responses are limited to one\u2019s own body, in the case\nof the prophets their minds can affect other bodies, whether animate\nor inanimate. In so doing, they can cause winds to blow, or rains to\nfall and even earthquake as well as healing or bringing illness on\nothers. While for us to day the Avicennan account of miracles might\nappear to border on the occult, within the scientific framework in\nwhich he was working, his position provided a legitimate natural\nexplanation of what otherwise could only be called the miraculous. To\nbe sure, not all philosophers accepted Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s\nsuggested naturalistic mechanism to explain the apparently miraculous.\nStill, few denied miracles outright. Thus, even Ibn Rushd apparently\nallowed that there are miracles\u2014as seen in the\nmiraculous practical value of the laws and religious claims embodied\nin Qur\u2019an\u2014while remaining virtually silent on how\nsuch a miracle as the Qur\u2019an could occur.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b provides the theologians\u2019 response to the\nphilosophers in his Incoherence of the Philosophers\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence, disc. 17; also see Fakhry\n1958: 56\u201378; Marmura 1989; L\u00f3pez-Farjeat 2016:\n131\u2013140). To begin, the Qur\u2019an contains accounts of\nmiracles, some of which clearly appear to be of the supernatural kind,\ne.g., the virgin birth and resurrection from the dead. A literal\nreading of these miracle-stories requires violations of essential or\nnatural causation, that is, regular, non-divine causal series that\npurportedly necessitate their effects. Ghaz\u0101l\u012b complains\nthat on the philosophers\u2019 account, the Quranic stories of\nsupernatural miracles cannot be taken literally.\n\n\nWhoever renders the habitual courses [of nature] a necessary constant,\nmakes all these [miracles] impossible. [The philosophers] have thus\ninterpreted what is said in the Qur\u2019an about the revivification\nof the dead metaphorically. (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b Incoherence,\n163 [23])\n\n\nWhile again Ghaz\u0101l\u012b allows for limited metaphorical readings\nof the Qur\u2019an, he does so only in those cases where he believes\nthat the literal sense leads to a genuine absurdity or even\ncontradiction. For example, Quranic passage that when taken literally\nimply that God has a body, for Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, must be read\nmetaphorically, for to be embodied is to be limited and yet\nGod is unlimited. Miracles of the supernatural kind, that is,\nviolations of natural causation and necessitation, in contrast, do not\ninvolve absurdities or outright contradictions. They are admittedly\nrare, but seemingly possible. Moreover, as we have seen, the\ntheologians view natural causation as nothing more than presumption on\nthe part of the philosophers, preferring occasionalism instead. Thus,\nfor Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, absent a proof for the impossibility of\nsupernatural miracles, one should accept the Qur\u2019anic stories as\nliteral accounts of real events. Still, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b does not\nultimately believe that these supernatural miracles should be the\nonly, even the primary, basis for one\u2019s belief in the veracity\nof the Qur\u2019an and Muhammad\u2019s prophethood\n(Ghaz\u0101l\u012b al-Munqidh, 41\u20134\n[Deliverance, 83\u20137]). As for the true proof for the\ninspired nature of the Qur\u2019an, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, in a way that\nforeshadows and even may have influenced Ibn Rushd\u2019s views,\npoints to the effect of a careful study of the Qur\u2019an and the\ntraditions surrounding Muhammad, the effect of which is the\npurification of hearts (ta\u1e63fiyat al-qul\u016bb) Both\nthe miraculous and the practical confirm the divine sovereignty and\ngovernance of all events and testify to the prophetic and miraculous\nnature of the Qur\u2019an.\n5. The Problem of evil\n\nOne of the important problems for Abrahamic religions is to explain\nthe presence of evil given the assumption that an all-wise, all-just,\nall-powerful and all-loving God created and is continuously conserving\nthe world. Modern philosophical discussions of the so-called problem\nof evil frequently focus on whether the presence of evil provides\nevidence against the existence of such a God, and so against classical\nmonotheism more generally. In contrast, for medieval Muslim\nphilosophers and theologians, the existence of God was never in\nquestion. Instead, \u2018the problem\u2019 of evil for these\nthinkers is a cluster of related issues, not the least of which is\n\u201cWhat is evil?\u201d and \u201cIs our world the best possible\nworld?\u201d Additionally, these thinkers wanted to reconcile the\ndivine attributes with the presence of evil or to determine which of\nthe divine attributes, particularly between divine justice and\nGod\u2019s omnipotence, trumps the others.\n\nOne strategy for explaining the presence of evil was to emphasize\nGod\u2019s transcendence and sovereignty over the universe.\nConsidering human actions, we judge that some cases of causing others\npain are justified, e.g., in disciplining someone or administering\njustice, while others are not, e.g., gratuitous violence. Given the\nbelief that God created the universe and controls the course of events\nin the world, how can we explain the suffering that animals,\nespecially humans, undergo? In this regard, some argued that the\nethical rules applicable among humans are not applicable to God.\nSupporters of this account, predeterminists (jabriyya),\nemphasize that the relation between God and the universe is one\nbetween property and owner. Just as a person can do what he wants with\nhis property, so also God has the right to treat his property in\nwhatever way he wants (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 483\u20135).\nAb\u016b al-\u1e24asan \u02bfAl\u012b b. Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\nal-Ash\u02bfar\u012b (d. 935/6), founder of the Ash\u02bfarite\ntheological school, seems to have defended such a position at an early\nstage in his career. He highlights God\u2019s absolute control over\nthe course of events in the world (Ash\u02bfar\u012b EIF: 50\u20131).\nThus, the suffering that affects animals and humans, does not need any\nfurther justification, since the universe is God\u2019s property and\nGod can treat creatures the way he pleases. He can punish an innocent\nperson and can hold people responsible to do that which they cannot do\n(Ash\u02bfar\u012b EIF: 111\u201313).\n\nInstead of emphasizing God\u2019s sovereignty over creation, another\napproach, which is usually associated with Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians, is to consider if there is any reason that justifies an\ninstance of suffering independent of whether the cause of that\nsuffering is God or a human agent (see Hourani 1971 and Vasalou 2008).\nIf one understands evil as unjustified suffering, then in such cases\nof suffering where there is a valid justification\u2014like a certain\nderived benefit or as punishment\u2014the suffering cannot be\nconsidered evil, at least not in the sense of unjustified suffering\n(\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 485\u20136). Consequently, in\nconsidering whether some case of suffering is evil, one must take into\naccount, not only the conditions of the agent, that is, whether God or\na creature caused it, but also whether there are justifying reasons\nfor the suffering. Since God is good and just, there must be reasons\njustifying any instance of suffering that is traced back to the divine\naction\u2014excluding human free actions. Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians identified some of these reason as compensation\n(\u02bfiwa\u1e0d), admonition (\u02bfibr),\npunishment, some kind of benefit (ma\u1e63la\u1e25a) or\neven grace (lu\u1e6df) (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK:\n487\u20139 and Ibn al-Mal\u0101him\u012b al-F\u0101\u02beiq,\n261\u201374). Thus, the Mu\u02bftazilite theologians argued that the\nexistence of suffering in the world is compatible with the goodness,\ngenerosity and justice of God.\n\nThe standards by which Mu\u02bftazilite theologians evaluate what is\ngood and just is the same for both God and humans. Their objective\nstandard of goodness and justice had further implications about the\npresence of evil in our world. One notable implication is that God\nmust do what is best (a\u1e63la\u1e25). Initially certain\nMu\u02bftazilites maintained that God must do what is best only in\nreligious matters, namely, commands and prohibitions (Ibn Mattawayh\nal-Tadhkira, II, 332\u20133, 360). Ultimately, most\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians came to agree that since God is generous\nand good, he does what is best in all his actions, whether religious\nmatters or creating and ordering the universe (Ibn\nal-Mal\u0101him\u012b al-F\u0101\u02beiq, 119 and \u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r al-A\u1e63la\u1e25: XIV, 53). Consequently,\neven if the Mu\u02bftazilite theologians do not emphasize this\nimplication, for them this world is the best possible world.\n\nThe Neoplatonic-inspired philosophers, like F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101, had yet another strategy to explain the presence\nof evil, which Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 exemplifies well\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b al-Ta\u02bfl\u012bq\u0101t, \u00a739\nand Avicenna MetaH: 9.6, 339\u201347). Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 takes up\nthe problem of evil within the context of divine providence (see above\n \u00a73.2.1).\n The question is how can the existence of evil in the universe be\nexplained, if the whole universe emanates from an absolutely good God?\nFollowing the Neoplatonist tradition, he associates goodness with\nexistence or being and evil with non-being or the imperfection of\nbeing proper to a thing. Since evil is in a sense a non-thing, and the\nnon-existent does not have a cause, it is a category mistake to ask\nwhat is the cause of evil absolutely speaking or to suggest that God\ncauses. it.\n\nStill, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 recognizes that some apparent evils, most\nnotably suffering, cannot simply be reduced to imperfections and the\nprivation of a proper existence. There are events, or conditions, that\nactively can cause suffering. Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 argues that evil as\nsuffering is applicable only to a small part of the whole universe,\nand yet is indispensable to that part, a \u2018necessary evil\u2019,\nif you will. This part of the universe consists of things that are\nsubject to generation and corruption. The sphere of generation and\ncorruption, according to Neoplatonic cosmology, is limited to the\nEarth, its inhabitants and the immediate atmosphere enveloping the\nEarth. Thus, in order for there to be absolutely no evil in the entire\ncosmos the sphere of generation and corruption either would have\nneeded not to exist or to be deprived of the properties that make\ngenerable and corruptible things what they are. Divine providence\nprecludes both options, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 argues, for roughly the\nsame reason in both cases, namely, the universe overall would be less\ngood than it actually is, even given the presence of some evil. An\nexample drawn from Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 clarifies his point. Certainly,\na poor man who loses his family and possessions to a fire, suffers an\nevil. Yet the fact that fire is essentially hot, so as to cook flesh\nand to burn wood, is in itself good. Likewise, that wood and flesh are\nessentially such as to be cooked by fire are in themselves good. To\neliminate fire\u2019s power to burn and the powers by which wood and\nflesh are cooked is to eliminate those very things. Thus, to eliminate\nthe possibility of this kind of suffering would be to eliminate an\nentire class of existents, namely, those subject to generation and\ncorruption. Consequently, an entire class of objective good in the\nuniverse would be lost, and so make the world overall less good. For\nIbn S\u012bn\u0101, such a loss is simply incompatible with his\nconception of divine providence, God is ultimately the source of an\norder that is the most perfectly possible commensurate with the chain\nof all possible existents.\n\nWhile both Ibn S\u012bn\u0101\u2019s and the Mu\u02bftazilite\nexplanations of the presence of evil imply that God has created the\nbest possible world, neither explicitly make this claim in their\nworks. It was Ghaz\u0101l\u012b, who explicitly argued that the actual\nworld is the best of all possible worlds (see Ormsby 1984). \u201cIn\nthe realm of the possible\u201d, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b assures us,\n\n\nthere is nothing at all more wondrously beautiful than [this world]\nnor more complete nor more perfect (laysa f\u012b-l-imk\u0101n\nabda\u02bf a\u1e63lan a\u1e25sana minhu wa l\u0101 atamma wa l\u0101\nakmala)\n\n\nor as it was popularized in the rhyming couplet,\n\n\nIn the realm of all the possible, nothing than what is is more\nwonderful. (laysa f\u012b-l-imk\u0101n abda\u02bf mimm\u0101\nk\u0101n) (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b FDU: 45\u20136 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Forty Principles, 259)\n\n\nThe imperfection that we see in the world is a result of the limits of\nour knowledge. The reason that this must be the best possible world is\nbecause if a better universe were possible and God did not create it,\nyet could have created it, he would have been miserly; however, God is\nomnibenevolent, and so this claim must be false. If God did not create\nthis purportedly better possible world because he could not do so,\nthen God would be impotent in some respect; however, God is\nomnipotent, and so this claim must be false. In short, none of these\nor similar options for explaining a less than optimal world are\nacceptable, for they all impugn God\u2019s majesty. To be sure,\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b is not claiming that there is no evil in the world;\nrather, for him, evil, as imperfection and suffering, is an essential\ningredient of the perfection of the world. While we might not fully\nrecognize how certain specific cases of evil contribute to the\nworld\u2019s overall perfection, nonetheless, those very\nimperfections can help one appreciate the contrasting good in the\nworld. Thus the actual universe, with the evil included in it, is the\nbest possible universe.\n6. Religious/theological language\n\nTheological language has a special status that presents a challenge\nfor thinkers particularly within the Abrahamic traditions since God is\nconsidered to be completely different from creation, while our\nlanguage applies mainly, if not solely, to creatures. Thus, to express\nwhat and how God is proves a difficult challenge. The follow section\nconsiders earlier Islamic approaches to understanding theological\nlanguage and how to read the Qur\u2019an\u2019s claims about God.\nThe next section\n (\u00a76.2)\n considers how later Muslim philosophers and the various schools of\nMuslim theologians developed these approaches with an eye to their\ndiscussions of the divine attributes.\n6.1 Early approaches to theological language\n\nThe earliest developments in Islamic theological language emphasized\nGod\u2019s absolute unity/simplicity (taw\u1e25\u012bd) and\nperhaps most importantly, since God is unlike creatures\n(mukh\u0101lafa li-l-\u1e25aw\u0101dith), his transcendence\n(tanz\u012bh). The proponents of divine transcendence, the\neponymous Jahmiyya, named after the movement\u2019s founder Jahm ibn\n\u1e62afw\u0101n (696\u2013745), denied that God has any attributes\n(see Sch\u00f6ck 2016: 55\u201377). Consequently, critics referred to\nthese theologians as apophaticists\n(Mu\u02bfa\u1e6d\u1e6dila, literally, \u2018those who\nvoid\u2019) to indicate that this position voids religious texts of\ntheir literal meaning since God transcends anything that we can say or\nunderstand about him. In response to this emphasis on divine\ntranscendence, there emerged those who stressed a hyper-literal\nreading of Qur\u2019anic verses\u2014such as Qur\u2019an 48: 10\n& 38, 71; 2: 115 and 11: 37 with their references to God\u2019s\nhands, face and eyes respectively\u2014and the prophetic traditions.\nBased on a literal reading, they made God similar to creatures and\nascribed to him a physical body, and so were labeled anthropomorphists\n(mushabbiha, literally, \u2018simulators\u2019) and\ncorporealists (mujassima) (see Van Ess 2000). A reaction to\nthese two earlier positions was that of the traditionalist\n(salaf\u012b) who claimed to follow the example of the\nearliest generation (salaf) of Muslims, i.e., the companions\nof the Prophet and the followers of the companions. They attempted to\nprovide a middle path between the apophatic and anthropomorphic\nunderstandings of God. They wanted neither to void the Qur\u2019an of\nits literal meaning by emphasizing divine transcendence nor to make\nGod similar to bodily creatures by taking the Qur\u2019an out of its\nbroader theological context. In general, they maintained that while\none knows that God has the various anthropomorphic characters\nthat the Qur\u2019an attributes to him, one should not delve into\nhow (kayf) God has those attributes, i.e., their\nmode of existence. All the major approaches developed later in the\nmedieval Islamic world, such as those of the Mu\u02bftazilites,\nAsh\u02bfarites, Maturidites and philosophers, can be traced back to\nand are modifications of these three approaches (Winter 2008:\n33\u2013141; Rudolph 1996 [2015]: 23\u2013121; and Watt 1973:\n242\u201350, 279\u2013318; 1992: 46\u201355, 64\u201397).\n\nUnderlying the apophatic, anthropomorphic and traditionalist positions\nabout divine attributes is a common assumption, namely, when one talks\nabout God and about creation, one must use univocal language. In other\nwords, it was assumed that if language is to be literal and\ninformative, properties predicated of God and of creatures must have\nexactly the same sense. Thus, if, as the Qur\u2019an purports, God\nhas hands, eyes and speaks, having hands, eyes and speaking must have\none the same meaning when predicated of God and of creatures. For\nMuslim Apophatic theologians, since we cannot take attributes\npredicated of God univocally in the way they are predicated of\ncreation, we must take them as negations about God. Conversely,\ngranting the assumption of univocal predication, Muslim\nanthropomorphists maintained it is legitimate to draw the implications\nthat God has bodily parts similar to those of creatures from the\nQur\u2019anic statements about God. Muslim Traditionalists, with the\nsame assumption, affirmed the literal meaning of religious texts that\npredicate of God creaturely properties, but they understood them as\ngoverned by the principle that God is unlike creation, and so those\nproperties that are found in creation and predicated of God may be\nacknowledged without additionally drawing their ordinary\nimplications.\n6.2 Theological language and the divine attributes\n\nIssues associated with how God or the divine self (dh\u0101t)\nis related to his properties or attributes (\u1e63if\u0101t)\ndrove further developments among medieval Islamic scholars. One common\nclassification of the divine attributes was into (1) essential\nproperties or attributes (\u1e63if\u0101t bi-dh\u0101t) and\n(2) properties of action (\u1e63if\u0101t bi-fi\u02bfl).\nEssential properties in turn are divided into negative\n(salb\u012b) properties and \u2018properties of\nma\u02bfn\u012b\u2019, that is, properties with a positive\n(thub\u016bt\u012b) meaning, and so add some further sense to\nwhat it is to be God. Negative properties indicate God\u2019s\ntranscendence and include unity, eternity (qidam), permanence\n(baq\u0101\u02be), self-subsistence (qiy\u0101m bi\nnafsihi), dissimilarity to the creation (mukh\u0101lafa\nli-l-\u1e25aw\u0101dith) and one may also include simplicity,\nalthough it is not usually included in the list. This list consists of\n\u2018formal properties\u2019 in the sense that they do not indicate\nany perfection per se but an absence of limitations on God,\ne.g., non-temporal, immutable and non-dependent (Burrell 1986:\n46\u201350). In general, all of these negative properties express a\ndissimilarity to creation, since each one of them indicates how God is\nnot like creation in a certain respect. The positive\nproperties (properties of ma\u02bf\u0101n\u012b) include\npower (qudra), will (ir\u0101da), knowledge\n(\u02bfilm), life (\u1e25ay\u0101t), speech\n(kal\u0101m), hearing (sam\u02bf) and sight\n(ba\u1e63ar). Properties of action include creation and the\nconservation of the universe, commanding, determining what happens\n(qadar) in the universe, etc. Positive properties and\nproperties of action imply some similarity to creation. One may add as\nanother sub-category of properties found in the Qur\u2019an those\nthat necessarily imply similarity with creaturely existence, like\nhaving a face, eyes, being seated, etc. In general later Muslim\ntheologians and philosophers understood this last set of properties\nmetaphorically. How to understand the sense and status of the divine\nessential properties with a positive meaning, however, remained an\nimportant problem for medieval Muslim scholars. The three most\nprominent and developed views were those of the Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians, the Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians and the\nphilosophers. Let us consider each school in turn.\n6.2.1 The Mu\u02bftazilites and theological language\n\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians strongly emphasized both God\u2019s\ndissimilarity to creation and his absolute oneness or simplicity. They\nask one to consider the properties or perfections found in humans and\nalso attributed to God, like, knowledge, power and will. As these\nproperties exist in humans there is a distinction between the thing\nthat possesses the perfections and the perfections themselves. Is the\nsame true of God? The answer for the Mu\u02bftazilites is a resounding\n\u2018no!\u2019 That is because if the divine attributes are\ndistinct from the divine self, then there would be a multiplicity of\ndivine, eternal entities, namely, the eternal and divine subject of\nattribution and the eternal and divine attributes. Consequently, they\nconclude, divine oneness and unity is lost and indeed one sinks into a\nform of polytheism far from the monotheism of Islam, a position that\nthe Mu\u02bftazilites found wholly untenable. For Mu\u02bftazilites,\nthe relation between God\u2019s self and his attributes must be\neither one of negation (salb), namely, to deny that God is in\nany way limited in the way creatures are, or one of identity, namely,\nthe divine attributes are not distinct from the divine self that bears\nthose attributes.\n\nIn the case of interpreting divine attributes as negations,\nMu\u02bftazilites modified a version of the earlier Muslim\napophaticists. For instance, to say that \u201cGod is knowing\u201d,\nmeans that God is not ignorant\u201d, or to say that \u201cGod is\npowerful\u201d means that \u201cGod is not weak or not\npowerless\u201d. The rest of the divine attributes are interpreted\nalong the same lines (Ash\u02bfar\u012b MI: 155\u201377, 183\u20135\n& 486 and \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 182\u2013213). Such\nattributions are helpful in understanding and speaking about God in\njust they way that eliminating possible choices from a multiple-choice\nquestion is helpful. One with such negative knowledge is certainly in\na better position than one who does not possesses it or is merely\nguessing or who wrongly believes that they know what is true.\nMoreover, informative, negative ascriptions do not require assigning\nto God a plurality of distinct positive properties, which in fact are\nmore fitting of creatures. Thus, in the case of negative ascriptions,\nboth God\u2019s transcendence and simplicity are safeguarded.\n\nAs for identifying God\u2019s self and attributes, Mu\u02bftazilites\nbegan by acknowledging that human language cannot avoid distinguishing\na subject and the properties predicated of that subject, and indeed\nthe Qur\u2019an addresses humans in human language. This feature is a\nlimit of human language and our cognitive capacities but not of God.\nIn the case of God, there is an identity of the subject and\nperfections predicated of the divine subject, even though human\nthinking and speaking cannot avoid distinguishing these as separate\n(Ash\u02bfar\u012b MI: 155\u201385 and \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK:\n182\u2013213). Unfortunately, identifying the divine properties of\nperfection with God Himself is not as simple as it might first appear.\nIf divine properties are identical to God, then they must be identical\nto each other, and yet, for example, despite adages to the contrary,\nknowledge seems to be truly distinct from power. Additionally, if God\nis identical to his properties, God would be a property, which hardly\nseems like an object worthy of worship (Ghaz\u0101l\u012b\nIncoherence, discs. 5\u20136; cf. Plantinga 1980:\n26\u201361 and McGinnis 2022).\n\nOne Mu\u02bftazilite response to this objection was that of Ab\u016b\n\u1e24\u0101shim al-Jubb\u0101\u02be\u012b (d. 933). In order to\nexplain, both why and how identifying positive properties with God\ndoes not lead to these absurdities, he argued that such properties are\nlike states (a\u1e25w\u0101l) of an entity\u2014e.g.,\nsitting\u2014which can differ depending upon how one considers them.\nThus, if a state is taken on its own, it does not really exist out\nthere\u2014there is no \u2018sitting\u2019 that exists out there\nsimply as sitting. Still, the fact that a state as some independent\nproperty does not exist out there does not mean that it is an\nabsolutely non-existent; rather, it exists by virtue of the existence\nof the entity in that state. Thus, to say that \u201cGod is\nknowing\u201d is to indicate a certain state of God and to say that\n\u201cGod is powerful\u201d is to indicate another state of God, yet\nin neither case, does the state indicate what God himself is\n(\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r SUK: 128\u20139; also see Schmidtke 2016a:\n162\u20134).\n6.2.2 Ash\u02bfarites/Maturidites and theological language\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians accused the Mu\u02bftazilite\ntheologians of all the problems following upon identifying the divine\nself and its attributes implies, such as the loss of distinction among\nthe divine attributes and that ultimately God would be identical with\na property. In opposition to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the Ash\u02bfarite\nand Maturidite theologians affirmed the distinction between the\npositive divine attributes, like knowledge, power and will, and God as\nthe bearer of those attributes. Thus, the problem facing them was to\nexplain how a multiplicity of divine things, and so a violation of\ndivine oneness, does not ensue if God\u2019s self and his distinct\nproperties of perfection are all divine and eternal.\n\nThey adopted two main strategies to address this problem. One early\nstrategy was to argue that properties predicated of God with some\npositive connotation\u2014properties that are not simply\nnegations\u2014are neither different from nor identical to the divine\nself. One challenge to such a view is that it seems to violate the Law\nof Excluded Middle, for a divine attribute must either be identical to\nthe divine self or not identical to it, in which case it would be\ndifferent from the divine self. Two early Ash\u02bfarite theologians,\nB\u0101qill\u0101n\u012b and Juwayn\u012b, apparently tried to adopt\nthe Mu\u02bftazilite theory of states to address this concern.\nConsidered in themselves, the divine attributes are not identical to\nGod, while considered relative to God\u2019s possession of those\nattributes they are identical to God (Shahrast\u0101n\u012b\nal-Milal, I 82 & Summa, 52\u201360; F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b Opinions, 61\u20134 and\nTaft\u0101z\u0101n\u012b Creed, 51\u20135).\n\nAnother way that Ash\u02bfarites and Maturidites attempted to observe\ndivine transcendence while upholding the meaningfulness of theological\nlanguage was to emphasize that when an attribute is predicated of God,\n\u201cGod is not like others that have that attribute\u201d. For\nexample, al-M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b, in his Kit\u0101b\nal-Taw\u1e25\u012bd, begins by criticizing the anthropomorphic\nposition by indicating certain shortcomings of conceiving God in a\nmanner similar to creation (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 43\u20137;\nalso see Rudolph 1996 [2015: 282\u20134]). He then explains how God\nis unlike creation. When properties predicated of creation are\npredicated of God, they are used in such a way that all the creaturely\nimplications are stripped off; they are, as it were, a \u2018winnowed\nconcept\u2019 (cf. Alston 1985). He also acknowledges that in order\nto know God, we must use the language that is used to talk about\ncreatures. Accordingly, we predicate perfections of God, but take into\naccount the principle that God is unlike creatures. For example, one\nmay say \u201cGod knows but His knowledge is unlike, knowledge\nbelonging to creatures\u201d. This way of predicating attributes of\nGod also found supporters among Mu\u02bftazilite theologians, like\n\u02bfAbd al-Jabbar, who offers and defends the same strategy and\nformula. The strategy, however, has its challenges, for if one\ninterprets \u2018unlike\u2019 in the strict sense, theological\nlanguage seems to lose its informative function, while if it is not\ntaken in a strict sense, it is not clear that divine transcendence is\nsecured.\n6.2.3 Philosophers and theological language\n\nTo varying degrees most, if not all, philosophers accepted some form\nof a negative theology when discussing the divine attributes\n(Kind\u012b PWK: \u201cOn First Philosophy\u201d, \u00a7\u00a7\nXIX\u2013XX; F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, ch. 1; and\nAvicenna MetaH: 8.4). For them, many, if not all, of the attributes\nascribed to God are in fact merely descriptions of ways that God is\nunlimited or infinite in some respect or other. The\nphilosophers\u2019 general strategy is the same as the\nMu\u02bftazilites (see\n \u00a76.2.1),\n where the basic idea, again, is that negative ascriptions, while\ninformative, do not involve God\u2019s necessarily possessing a\nplurality of positive attributes, which would jeopardize both divine\nsimplicity and God\u2019s transcendence.\n\nCertain philosophers, like Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and Ibn Rushd, likewise\nrepeated the Mu\u02bftazilite position that the divine self is\nidentical with its essential attributes, like life, knowledge and\npower (Avicenna al-Naj\u0101t, 264 = MR07: 214 & MetaH:\n1.7 & 8.4 and Ibn Rushd Tahafut, 299\u2013301 [1954:\n177\u20139]). Ibn Rushd notes that in a limited sense this\nidentification of some entity with its essential attributes is true\neven of creatures. He provides the example of the definition of\n\u2018man\u2019 as a \u2018rational animal\u2019. Both rationality\nand animality are parts of the definition of \u2018man\u2019, but\nthey are not distinct parts constituting the flesh-and-blood man in\nthe world in the way that color and shape are. This analogy is not to\nsuggest that one can have a definition of God, which Ibn Rushd flatly\ndenies, but only to indicate that the way humans conceive an entity\nneeds not perfectly reflect how that entity exists in the world.\nIndeed, Ibn Rushd goes further and provides a principled Aristotelian\nreason why no creature could ever form a definition of God or fully\ngrasp the divinity (Ibn Rushd Tahafut, 345\u20136 [1954:\n207]). He notes that according to Aristotelian principles to grasp\nwhat a thing is essentially, so as to be able to have a definition,\nrequires that in some sense the intellect becomes the very thing\ngrasped. Thus, since a finite human intellect can never grasp the\ninfinite\u2014indeed, to whatever extent it does grasp it, the very\nact of grasping it limits it so that it is finite in the human\nintellect\u2014it can never form a definition of God nor fully grasp\nGod\u2019s essential existence. Thus, by necessity the human\nintellect conceives a plurality of attributes in its conception of God\nwhere in fact none exists. Admittedly, this discussion comes from one\nof Ibn Rushd\u2019s popular works and not from one intended solely\nfor the philosophers, and so whether it presents his considered view\non the subject remains unclear. As for Ibn S\u012bn\u0101, he is more\nforthcoming, arguing that all the various (positive) essential\nattributes said of God really are nothing more than alternative\ndescriptions of a single reality, namely, necessary existence through\nitself (w\u0101jib al-wuj\u016bd bi-dh\u0101tihi), which is\nidentical with and unique to God.\n7. Ethics in Islam\n\nIn addition to the role of reason in justifying specific ethical\njudgments like what is morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn\nwa-l-qub\u1e25)\u2014a discussion that mirrors those about\nreason and faith in Islam more generally\n (\u00a71.2)\u2014Muslim\n thinkers also were concerned with the ontological status of normative\nproperties, like goodness and badness (see Emon 2010). With respect to\nthis issue, one asks whether ethical facts exist independently of God\nor do they originate from and have their morally binding force as a\nresult of a divine command. On the one hand, if the demands of morally\ngood and bad actions are independent of God, then is God subject to\nthose demands or not? If so, then does God observe them as a matter of\nnecessity, in which case God\u2019s power seems limited, or does he\nobserve them as a matter of will or choice, in which case were he not\nto observe them would he be morally bad, since again these demands\ndetermine morally good and bad actions? On the other hand, if ethical\ndicta have their source and force in God\u2019s commanding them,\ncould God have commanded contrary to what he did and so invert right\nand wrong? For example, could God have commanded us to lie, in which\ncase lying would have been obligatory and even morally good?\n7.1 The Mu\u02bftazilites on the morally right and wrong (al-\u1e25usn wa-l-qub\u1e25)\n\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians defended the view that reason can acquire\na knowledge of what is morally right and wrong, precisely because\nstandards of right and wrong are purportedly objective and not\narbitrary, and so are independent of God\u2019s merely commanding\nthem. Their views are laid out within the context of moral\nresponsibility (see Hourani 1971 & 1985 and Vasalou 2008). For\nMu\u02bftazilite theologians, while perhaps reason cannot discover all\nof those actions for which one is religiously responsible in order to\nbe a devout Muslim (such as praying five times daily or avoiding\npork), one could come to know the more general ethical human\nresponsibilities (such as avoiding lying and honoring one\u2019s\nbenefactor). This is because according to the Mu\u02bftazilites, the\nproperties that make an action good or bad, and for which one is\nmorally responsible, are objective qualities relative to the action,\nto the consequence(s) of the action or to the agent of the action.\nThese moral properties are objective precisely because we\nobserve\u2014whether through self-reflection or inference from the\noutward behavior of others\u2014the benefit or the harm that an\naction causes. Thus, in a consequentialist vein, these\nMu\u02bftazilites relate the morally good with what is genuinely\nbeneficial and the morally bad with what is harmful. Religion then\nconfirms what reason knows about the moral status of an action and its\nconsequence(s).\n\nSince for these thinkers the ethical status of an action does not\ndepend on a divine command, the question arises whether God is bound\nto behave ethically. \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r argued that ethical\ndemands are binding and applicable not only to human agents but also\nto God and his action as well (\u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r\nal-Ta\u02bfd\u012bl: 52\u201370). Thus, he argues that if\none denies that God is bound to do and to command the morally good,\nthe commands and prohibitions given in scripture would be not only\narbitrary but possibly even mutable and unreliable. For example, if\none allowed that God could lie, then God or the prophets could be\nlying about what is required for salvation or what leads to damnation,\nin which case all the religious teaching would be under suspicion, a\nposition which that \u02bfAbd al-Jabb\u0101r simply found\nunacceptable.\n7.2 Responses to the Mu\u02bftazilites\n\nMost medieval Muslim thinkers, whether philosophers, theologians or\nSufis, recognized some need for religion in order to possess a\ncomplete understanding of things ethical. Although they generally\ngranted that humans have some intuitive recognition of virtues and\nwhat is morally good and bad, they emphasized that various human\nconditions limit our ability always to judge correctly about the\nethical status of particular actions. One such limit is our inherent\ncognitive limits. Thus, the Sufi master Ibn \u02bfArab\u012b complains\nthat because the moral goodness or badness of actions may depend on\ncertain conditions that human reason cannot comprehended, divine\nrevelation is needed to inform us of the ethical status of our actions\n(Ibn al-\u02bfArab\u012b al-Fut\u016b\u1e25\u0101t\nal-Makkiyya (b), I 459\u201360 & VII 326). For instance,\nwhat we \u2018observe\u2019 or judge to be a benefit may, all things\nconsidered, actually be harmful and similarly for our judgments about\nwhat is harmful. Only from a \u2018God\u2019s eye perspective\u2019\ncan one be assured that in fact all things have been considered. In\naddition to our inherent cognitive limits, personal and social\nconditions affect the reliability of our ethical judgments. For\nexample, the Sunni jurist, \u1e24ak\u012bm al-Tirmidh\u012b (d. ca.\n869), noted that while reason has some share in making sound moral\njudgments, selfishness and the human desire for material benefits and\npleasures hinders our ability always to reason correctly and\nobjectively about what is ethically right and wrong (Tirmidh\u012b\nKit\u0101b Ithb\u0101t al-\u02bfilal, 67\u201378).\nF\u0101r\u0101b\u012b and Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 identify yet another\nhuman condition that requires religion to aid reason in determining\nright ethical rules. They maintained that ethical and political\njudgments are not a priori necessary truths, but well-known\nand commonly accepted specific rules\n(taf\u1e63\u012bl\u0101t) acquired from attending to various\npractices over long periods of time. Thus, without knowing this\nsocio-cultural history that religion preserves, one cannot know what\nis efficacious for living a good and virtuous life here on earth\n(F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b Perfect State, 77\u20138 and Avicenna\nMetaH: 10.2\u20134; also see Erlwein 2019).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite theologians in general vehemently\ncriticized the Mu\u02bftazilite position that reason alone can\ndiscover even general ethical demands incumbent upon humans and God\nalike. Their criticisms highlight the unacceptable theological\nimplications of the Mu\u02bftazilite position and the inherent limits\nof human reason. The most common criticism comes from the theological\nimplication that God is compelled or obligated to do the good. Recall\nthat the general Mu\u02bftazilite position, as \u02bfAbd\nal-Jabb\u0101r articulated it, holds that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions regardless of their agents, and so since God is\ngood, God is morally compelled to do good. One obvious implication of\nthis view is that if God cannot do bad actions, then God\u2019s power\nis limited, and so God is not wholly omnipotent. From a theological\npoint of view, Ash\u02bfarite theologians found this implication\nunacceptable. Consequently, they denied that good and bad are inherent\nproperties of actions and instead demanded that all ethical standards\nare dependent on what God himself commands.\n\nAs for criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite position from the\nnature of human reason, Ash\u02bfarite and Maturidites theologians\navailed themselves of all the argument we have already seen about the\nlimits of our cognitive capacities and the constraints of our human\ncondition. Thus, for example, M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b presses the\npoint that while humans may have some inkling of general ethical\nprinciples and what is morally good and bad, these judgments are\nalways shaky given the frailty of our cognitive capacities.\nConsequently, religion is always needed to set our moral judgments on\nfirm ground (M\u0101tur\u012bd\u012b KT: 346\u201351).\n\nAsh\u02bfarite and Maturidite scholars also added further arguments to\nthe arsenal of criticisms against the Mu\u02bftazilite ethical theory.\nFor instance, in The Guide to Conclusive Proofs, Juwayn\u012b\nputs forth an account of the good and bad, which in certain ways\nanticipates the moral theory of David Hume seven hundred years later\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 141\u20136). The Mu\u02bftazilite\nposition rests on two key elements: (1) that some actions are either\ninherently and rationally good or bad and (2) the implicit assumption\nthat a rational agent must act in a rational way. Juwayn\u012b simply\ndenies that moral actions are inherently rational and that\nconsequently there is anything irrational when one does a good or bad\naction. To be sure, actions can be obligatory and praiseworthy or\nprohibited and blameworthy, but not rational. Instead, continues\nJuwayn\u012b, when through self-reflection or inference one recognizes\nthat certain actions are seemingly beneficial and others harmful, one\nmerely instinctually recognizes that those actions produce pleasure or\npain. It is the human\u2019s (and all animals\u2019) natural\ninstinct to seek pleasure and to avoid pain that motivates the action,\nnot some inherent rational property of the object that reason\ngrasps.\n\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b likewise rejected the Mu\u02bftazilites\u2019\nposition, which he claimed rested upon an ambiguity in the meanings of\nthe terms \u2018good\u2019, \u2018bad\u2019 and\n\u2018obligatory\u2019 (w\u0101jib). For Ghaz\u0101l\u012b,\nwhen one says an action is \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019,\nthose value judgments must be understood in terms of the intention or\npurpose relative to the agent or the one affected by the action. So\nunderstood, an action is good if it achieves the intended purpose and\nbad if it does not. While reason can direct and set one\u2019s\nintentions, so can imagination and estimation (wahm) as well\nas our passions and appetites. These latter faculty, however,\nfrequently fail to get at what is ultimately beneficial and harmful\nfor us, and so they fail to get at what an agent would intend all\nthings considered. Divine law provides precisely the\n\u2018all-things-considered\u2019 view.\n\nAs for human reason\u2019s determining what is morally incumbent upon\nGod, Ghaz\u0101l\u012b continues that since good and bad are related\nto the intentions of the agent, it is impossible for reason alone to\ndetermine whether God\u2019s actions are good or bad since we simply\ndo not know God\u2019s intentions independent of revelation. Fakhr\nal-D\u012bn al-R\u0101z\u012b developed a similar defense (F. D.\nR\u0101z\u012b al-Ma\u1e6d\u0101lib, 289\u2013304; also see\nShihadeh 2006 and 2021). Now instead of understanding good and bad\nrelative to an agent\u2019s intentions, Razi explains them in\nconsequentialist terms: Actions are good when, relative to the agent\nor one affected by the action, they are beneficial or pleasurable and\nbad when they are harmful or painful. Since God is in no need of\nbenefit and in no way can be pained, there is a sense in which his\nactions are simply beyond good and evil.\n\nIn light of their denial that there is any objective, God-independent\nstandard of right and wrong to which God is beholden, Ash\u02bfarites\nwere accused of undermining God\u2019s justice and making the\ngoodness or badness of actions arbitrary. That is because if there\nwere no limits to what God can morally command, then what God willed\nin the past to be good or bad, he could in the future will and so\ncommand to be contrariwise. Indeed, God may inflict pain on an\ninnocent for no reason whatsoever, and yet that action would be good\nprecisely because God commanded it. The Ash\u02bfarites were not\ninsensitive to this complaint. While both al-Juwayn\u012b and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b insist on God\u2019s absolute omnipotence and so\nGod\u2019s possibility to act arbitrarily, they also note that an\naction is only actually arbitrary if it is actually carried out, not\nif its occurrence is merely possible. Thus, a preferred Ash\u02bfarite\nresponse to the arbitrariness complaint was that the possibility of\nthe occurrence is not the occurrence of the possibility; God confirms\nvia revelation that he gives reward for good actions and he may punish\nonly those who do not fulfill what is decreed by revelation\n(Juwayn\u012b Proofs, 157\u201364, 209\u201311 and\nGhaz\u0101l\u012b Moderation, 172\u201388).",
