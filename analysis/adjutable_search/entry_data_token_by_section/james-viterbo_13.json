    "main_text": "Ethics || Love of Self vs. Love of God\n7.3 Love of Self vs. Love of God\n\nAlthough there has never been any doubt among medieval theologians\nthat man ought to love God more than he loves himself, medieval\ntheologians did disagree about whether man can fulfill this obligation\nby purely natural means or whether he requires grace in order to do\nso. The consensus in the thirteenth century, shared, among other\nauthors, by Thomas Aquinas, Giles of Rome, and Godfrey of Fontaines,\nwas that although perfect love of God is possible only through grace,\nman does have the natural capacity to love God more than himself (See\nOsborne 2005 for discussion of the topic in the thirteenth century,\nincluding in James of Viterbo). Many of these authors believed that\ngranting man such a capacity was necessary in order to safeguard the\nuniversally accepted principle that \u201cgrace perfects, not\ndestroys, nature\u201d. For if man is naturally inclined to love\nhimself more than God and is made to love God more than himself only\nthrough grace, then that natural inclination is not so much perfected\nas replaced by a different one. Against these authors, James of\nViterbo in his Quodlibet II, question 20 famously defended\nthe view that man naturally loves himself more than God. Before\nstating James\u2019 argument in support of this position, it is\nimportant to be attentive to the precise way in which he formulated\nthe question, as well as to how he understands the term\n\u201clove\u201d (diligere). \n\nFirst, the question James raised in Quodl. II, q. 20, was not\n(a): \u201cDoes man naturally love God more than he loves\nhimself?\u201d or (b): \u201cDoes man naturally love himself more\nthan God,\u201d but rather (c): \u201cDoes man naturally love God\nmore than himself, or the converse (vel econverso)?\u201d\nWhat (c), but not (a) or (b), rules out is that man can love himself\nand God equally. James did not think that this was so. He compared the\ncase of self-love vs. love of God to the distinction between natural\nand supernatural knowledge: \u201cNatural knowledge starts from\ncreatures and proceeds thence to God; contrariwise, supernatural\nknowledge begins with God and proceeds thence to creatures.\u201d\nSince the distinction between natural and supernatural knowledge is\nexhaustive and mutually exclusive, there is no other kind of\nknowledge, and hence none that would proceed \u201cequally\u201d\nfrom creatures and God. But for the comparison between knowledge and\nlove to hold, the conclusion that applies to the former must apply to\nthe latter, and that conclusion is that if man does not love God more\nthan himself, then he loves himself more than God; and conversely.\n\nSecond, following the practice of many scholastics, James\ndistinguished between two forms of love: the \u201clove of\ndesire\u201d or \u201clove of covetousness\u201d (amor\nconcupiscentiae), which he defined as the \u201clove of some\ngood which we want for ourselves or for others,\u201d and the love of\nfriendship (amor amicitiae), or the love of someone for their\nown sake. Although James believed that rational creatures love God in\nboth these ways, he was clear that the debate about whether or not man\nloves himself more than God or the converse concerned only the love of\nfriendship; the debate, then, was about whether man naturally loves\nhimself for his own sake more than he loves God for his own\nsake\u2014which was the view James defended\u2014or the converse.\n\n\nJames offered two arguments to support his position. The first was\nbased on the principle that the mode of natural love must be\ncommensurate with the mode of being and, hence, of the mode of being\none\u2014since everything that is is one. Now a thing is one with\nitself by virtue of numerical identity, but it is one with something\nelse by virtue of a certain conformity. For instance, Socrates is one\nwith himself by virtue of his being Socrates, but he is one with Plato\nby virtue of the fact that both share the same form. But the being\nsomething has by virtue of numerical identity is \u201cgreater\u201d\nthan the being it has by reason of something it shares with another.\nAnd given that the species of natural love follows the mode of being,\nit follows that it is more perfect to love oneself than to love\nanother (Quodl. II, q. 20, p. 206, 148 \u2013 p. 149, 165).\nThe second argument attempted to derive the same conclusion from the\nprinciple that \u201cGod\u2019s love of charity elevates [human]\nnature\u2019s\u201d love of God ( Quodl. II, q. 20, p. 207,\n166\u2013167). James reasoned that there was only one way in which\ncharity could elevate nature, namely by making it love God above all\nelse. But if this was so, it had to follow \u201cthat nature in\nitself cannot love God in this way (...). For if it could, it would\nnot need to be elevated by charity.\u201d (Quodl. II, q. 20,\np. 207, 181\u2013184). And for James to say that nature itself cannot\nlove God above all else was just to say that man naturally loves\nhimself above all else. QED.\n\nBut if charity elevated nature in this way, did it not\n\u201cdestroy\u201d nature after all, by substituting for the\ninclination to love the self above all else the entirely different\ninclination to love God above all else? James\u2019 answer was that\nit did not, since \u201cthrough charity man loves himself no less\nthan before; he simply loves God more.\u201d (Quodl. II, q.\n20, p. 210, 280\u2013282).\n\nJames\u2019 opposition to the consensus position on the issue of the\nlove of self vs. love of God did not go unnoticed. It elicited\nconsiderable criticism in the years following his death, from such\nauthors as Durand of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain, Peter of Palude, and John\nof Naples (Jeschke 2009).\n",
