Some philosophers, however, have argued that, on closer\ninspection, ST collapses into TT, thus revealing itself as a form of\nTT in disguise. The collapse argument was originally formulated by\nDaniel Dennett (1987):\n\n\nIf I make believe I am a suspension bridge and wonder what I will do\nwhen the wind blows, what \u201ccomes to my mind\u201d in my\nmake-believe state depends on\u2026 my knowledge of\nphysics\u2026 Why should my making believe I have your beliefs be\nany different? In both cases, knowledge of the imitated object is\nneeded to drive the\u2026 \u201csimulation\u201d, and the\nknowledge must be\u2026 something like a theory. (Dennett\n1987: 100\u2013101, emphasis added)\n\n\nDennett\u2019s point is clear. If I imagine being, say, a bridge,\nwhat I imagine will depend on my theory of bridges. Suppose that I\nhave a folk theory of bridges that contains the following principle:\n\u201cA bridge cannot sustain a weight superior to its own\nweight\u201d. In this case, if I imagine an elephant weighing three\ntons walking over a bridge weighing two tons, I will imagine the\nbridge collapsing. Since my \u201cbridge-simulation\u201d is\nentirely theory-driven, \u201csimulation\u201d is a\nmisnomer. The same carries over to \u201csimulating other\npeople\u201ds mental states\u2019, Dennett says. If I try to imagine\nyour mental states, what I imagine will depend entirely on my Theory\nof Mind. Therefore, the label \u201cmental simulation\u201d is\nmisleading.\n\nHeal (1986) and Goldman (1989) promptly replied to Dennett. Fair\nenough, if a system S tries to simulate the state of a\nradically different system Q (e.g., if a human being tries to\nsimulate the state of a bridge), then S\u2019s simulation must\nbe guided by a theory. However, if a system S tries to simulate\nthe state of a relevantly similar system S*, then\nS\u2019s simulation can be entirely process-driven:\nto simulate the state which S* is in, S simply has to\nrun in itself a process similar to the one S* underwent. Given\nthat, for all intents and purposes, human beings are relevantly\nsimilar to each other, a human being can mentally simulate what\nfollows from having another human being\u2019s mental states without\nresorting to a body of theoretical knowledge about the mind\u2019s\ninner workings. She will just need to reuse her own cognitive\nmechanisms to implement a simulation process.\n\nThis reply invited the following response (Jackson 1999). If the\npossibility of process-driven simulation is grounded in the similarity\nbetween the simulator and the simulated, then I have to assume that\nyou are relevantly similar to me, when I mentally simulate your mental\nstates. This particular assumption, in turn, will be derived from a\ngeneral principle\u2014something like \u201cHuman beings\nare psychologically similar\u201d. Therefore, mental simulation is\ngrounded in the possession of a theory. The threat of collapse is\nback! One reply to Jackson\u2019s arguments is as follows (for other\nreplies see Goldman 2006): the fact that process-driven simulation is\ngrounded in the similarity among human beings does not entail\nthat, in order to run a simulation, a simulator must know (or believe,\nor assume) that such similarity obtains; no more, indeed, than the\nfact that the solubility of salt is grounded in the molecular\nstructure of salt entails that a pinch of salt needs to know chemistry\nto dissolve in water.\n\nGranting that ST and TT are distinct theories, we can now ask a\ndifferent question: are the theories better off individually or should\nthey join forces somehow? Let us be more explicit. Can ST on its own\noffer an adequate account of mindreading (or at least of the great\nmajority of its episodes)? And what about TT? A good number of\ntheorists now believe that neither ST nor TT alone will do. Rather,\nmany would agree that these two theories need to cooperate, if they\nwant to reach a satisfactory explanation of mindreading. Some authors\nhave put forward TT-ST hybrid models, i.e., models in which the tacit\nknowledge of a Theory of Mind is the central aspect of mindreading,\nbut it is in many cases supplemented by simulation processes\n(Botterill & Carruthers 1999; Nichols & Stich 2003). Other\nauthors have instead defended ST-TT hybrid models, namely, accounts of\nmindreading where the pride of place is given to mental simulation,\nbut where the possession of a Theory of Mind plays some non-negligible\nrole nonetheless (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002; Goldman 2006; Heal\n2003). Since this entry is dedicated to ST, we will briefly touch upon\none instance of the latter variety of hybrid account.\n\nHeal (2003) suggested that the domain of ST is restricted to those\nmental processes involving rational transitions among\ncontentful mental states. To wit, Heal maintains that mental\nsimulation is the cognitive routine that we employ to represent other\npeople\u2019s rational processes, i.e., those cognitive\nprocesses which are sensitive to the semantic content of the mental\nstates involved. On the other hand, \n\n\nwhen starting point and/or outcome are [states] without content,\nand/or the connection is not [rationally] intelligible, there is no\nreason \u2026 to suppose that the process \u2026 can be simulated.\n(Heal 2003: 77)\n\n\nAn example will clarify the matter. Suppose that I know that you\ndesire to eat sushi, and that you believe that you can order sushi by\ncalling Yama Sushi. To reach the conclusion that you will\ndecide to call Yama Sushi, I only need to imagine desiring\nand believing what you desire and believe, and to run a simulated\ndecision-making process in myself. No further knowledge is required to\npredict your decision: simulation alone will do the job. Consider, on\nthe other hand, the situation in which I know that you took a certain\ndrug and I want to figure out what your mental states will be. In this\ncase\u2014Heal says\u2014my prediction cannot be based on mental\nsimulation. Rather, I need to resort to a body of information about\nthe likely psychological effects of that drug, i.e., I have to resort\nto a Theory of Mind (fair enough, I can also take the drug myself, but\nthis will not count as mental simulation). This, according to Heal,\ngeneralizes to all cases in which a mental state is the input or the\noutput of a mere causal process. In those cases, mental\nsimulation is ineffective and should be replaced by theorizing. Still,\nthose cases do not constitute the central part of mindreading. In\nfact, many philosophers and cognitive scientists would agree that the\ncrucial component of human mindreading is the ability to reason about\nothers\u2019 propositional attitudes. And this is exactly\nthe ability that, according to Heal, should be explained in term of\nmental simulation. This is why Heal\u2019s proposal counts as an\nST-TT hybrid, rather than the other way around.\n",
