    "main_text": "Born to fail, or unborn?\n6. Born to fail, or unborn?\n\nWhat happens when a presupposition is false? The textbook\nproto-history of answers to this question goes as follows. According\nto Frege (1892), if an expression A suffers from\npresupposition failure, then any sentence containing A will\nlack a truth value; Russell (1905) famously denied this, holding that\nsuch a sentence will always be true or false; and then Strawson (1950)\nreaffirmed Frege\u2019s position, more or less. What is less well known, at\nleast insofar as it usually doesn\u2019t make it into introductory classes\non philosophy of language, is that in subsequent work, Strawson partly\nrecanted his initial view and came to doubt that presupposition\nfailure invariably entails lack of truth value.\n\nTaking a closer look at how speakers actually assess a sentence,\nStrawson\u2019s (1964) paper argues that presupposition failure may but\nneed not cause a sentence to be infelicitous. Two of his examples are\nthe following:\n\n(45a)\nJones spent the morning at the local swimming pool.\n(45b)\nThe exhibition was visited yesterday by the king of France.\n\n\nIf there is no swimming pool locally, it is \u201cnatural\nenough\u201d, according to Strawson, to say that (45a) is false, and\nsince the king of France doesn\u2019t exist, the same applies to (45b). And\nif these sentences are false, their negations must be true. So, if\nthese subtle judgments are accepted, there are cases in which\npresupposition failure does not prevent us from saying that a sentence\nis true or false. But Strawson hasn\u2019t changed his mind about Russell\u2019s\nexample:\n\nConfronted with the classical example, \u201cThe king of France is\nbald\u201d, we may well feel it natural to say, straight off, that\nthe question whether the statement is true or false doesn\u2019t arise\nbecause there is no king of France. (Strawson 1964: 90)\n\n\nStrawson goes on to observe, however, that speakers who subscribe to\nthis judgment may want to reconsider their verdict if the context is\nset up the right way. For instance, if Russell\u2019s sentence is used to\nanswer the question, \u201cWhat examples, if any, are there of famous\ncontemporary figures who are bald?\u201d, we may be more inclined to\nsay that the answer is simply false.\n\nStrawson\u2019s explanation for these facts is given in terms of\ntopicality. The most likely purpose of a sentence like (45a) is to\ndescribe what Jones has been doing in the morning, rather than, say,\nwho the local swimming pool was visited by. That is, in the absence of\nfurther information about the context in which this sentence is\nuttered, its topic will be Jones\u2019s exploits. Similarly, a sentence\nlike (45b) will normally be used to convey information about the\nexhibition. If so, although the sentence purports to refer to the king\nof France, it is not about him; the king of France is not the topic of\ndiscourse, nor part of the topic. In other words, the existence of the\nking of France is not at-issue. Strawson\u2019s suggestion is that\nthis circumstance influences the way presupposition failure is dealt\nwith. On this view, presupposition failure results in infelicity only\nif it affects the topic of a sentence; otherwise the sentence will be\njudged true or false, as appropriate.\n\nOne of the appealing features of this analysis is that it takes into\naccount the context-dependence of speakers\u2019 intuitions. As Strawson\nnotes, Russell\u2019s sentence (46) will by default be construed as being\nabout the king of France, whence a strong tendency to judge the\nsentence infelicitous.\n\n(46)\nThe king of France is bald.\n\n\nIf, however, the discourse is about royal baldness in general, for\ninstance, the grammatical subject of (46) is used to say something\nabout that topic, and Strawson\u2019s account predicts that the sentence is\nmore likely to be judged false, which seems correct. Another\nobservation that neatly falls into place is that word order may have\nan effect on speakers\u2019 intuitions about presupposition failure. As\nStrawson observes, if we compare (45b) with (47), where the defective\ndescription is in subject position, we would be \u201ca shade more\nsqueamish\u201d to say that the sentence is simply false (p. 91).\nThis is precisely what one should expect if speakers\u2019 intuitions were\ntopic-dependent.\n\n(47)\nThe king of France visited the exhibition yesterday.\n\n\nAssuming that Strawson\u2019s observations are correct, should we say (a)\nthat non-topical definites are non-presuppositional, or (b) that they\ndo have presuppositions, whose failure happens not to affect speakers\u2019\ntruth-value judgments? Some authors argue for the former (e.g.,\nReinhart 1982, Horn 1989); this is Strawson\u2019s view, as well. Von\nFintel (2004) argues for the latter: topical or non-topical,\n\u201cthe king of France\u201d always triggers the presupposition\nthat there is a king of France; it\u2019s just our truth-value judgments\nthat fluctuate.\n\nVon Fintel\u2019s position is in line with what has been a working\nhypothesis for many years in theories of projection. According to\nthese theories, presuppositions are never really cancelled: if a\npresupposition seems to disappear, it is because it projects to a\nnon-global context. It bears emphasizing that this view is not\nirrevocably linked to these theories. It\u2019s just that there is no need\nto assume that there are part-time presupposition triggers (in a sense\nwe expand upon in Section 8 below), because non-global projection can\nbe relied upon to explain why presuppositions sometimes seem to\ndisappear. However, this working hypothesis may have to be reassessed\nif we want to account for Strawson\u2019s observations, which might be\ntaken to show that presuppositions are cancellable not only in complex\nsentences but in simple sentences, as well.\n\nSo far we\u2019ve only talked about definite descriptions. Some other\ntriggers show similar variability, but not all of them do. On the one\nhand, the domain presuppositions associated with strong quantifiers\nlike \u201call\u201d and \u201cmost\u201d behave very much like\ndefinite presuppositions (de Jong and Verkuyl 1985, Lappin and\nReinhart 1988, Geurts 2007). For example, when uttered out of the\nblue, (48) will sound odd, but when proffered in response to\nStrawson\u2019s question, \u201cWhat examples, if any, are there of famous\ncontemporary figures who are bald?\u201d, it seems more likely to be\njudged false:\n\n(48)\nAll South-American monarchs are bald.\n\n\nOn the other hand, consider the following:\n\n(49a)\n#BENEDICT XVI is the incumbent pope, too.\n(49b)\n#Carnap managed to be born on May 18, 1891.\n\n\nGiven that there is only one incumbent pope and that it can\u2019t have\ntaken Carnap any effort to be born on May 18, 1891, both (49a) and\n(49b) suffer from presupposition failure. But if someone who knew that\nthere was only one incumbent pope uttered (49a), it would not seem\nentirely natural to say that they had lied. One might even say that\nthese sentences are true, and this intuition does not seem to\nbe topic dependent. The reason for this may be that the\npresuppositions in question are incidental to the primary\ncontent of these sentences.\n",
