Life and Work\n\nStrauss was born on September 20, 1899 in Kirchhain, a small, rural\ntown in Germany. He was raised in an orthodox Jewish home and also\nstudied at a Gymnasium in nearby Marburg where he received a broad\nhumanistic education. At the age of seventeen Strauss became a devoted\nadvocate of political Zionism. He spent a year in Belgium as an\ninterpreter for the military after which he began his studies at the\nUniversity of Marburg, where the neo-Kantian Jewish philosopher,\nHermann Cohen (1842\u20131918) had established a thriving school of\nneo-Kantianism. In 1921, Strauss completed his dissertation,\n\u201cThe problem of Knowledge in the Philosophical Doctrine of F.H.\nJacobi,\u201d under the direction of Cohen\u2019s student, Ernst\nCassirer (1874\u20131945). Strauss\u2019s dissertation considered\nthe implications of Jacobi\u2019s notion of revelation for the\nproblem of knowledge. Although Strauss would come to regard his\ndissertation as \u201ca disgraceful performance,\u201d the question\nof the meaning and status of divine revelation would continue to\noccupy him throughout his life.\n\nStrauss spent 1922 in Freiburg where he attended Edmund\nHusserl\u2019s lectures on phenomenology. Like a number of others,\nwho would soon become famous philosophers in their own right, such as\nEmmanuel Levinas, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Karl L\u00f6with, and Hannah\nArendt, Strauss was quickly taken with Husserl\u2019s student, Martin\nHeidegger, who, he later wrote, impressed him as no other contemporary\nthinker had. The following year Strauss began lecturing in Frankfurt\nunder the auspices of a center for adult education, the Freies\nJ\u00fcdische Lehrhaus, founded by Franz Rosenzweig\n(1886\u20131929). In 1925, Julius Guttmann (1880\u20131950) invited\nStrauss to Berlin to edit the jubilee edition of Moses\nMendelssohn\u2019s work for the Academy of the Science of Judaism. In\n1930, Strauss published his first book, Spinoza\u2019s Critique\nof Religion, dedicated to Rosenzweig\u2019s memory, in which he\nargued that nineteenth and twentieth-century readers of Spinoza could\nsee him as a \u201cGod intoxicated man\u201d only because they had\nceased to take the possibility of divine revelation seriously.\n\nIn 1932, Strauss wrote a review of Carl Schmitt\u2019s recently\npublished book The Concept of the Political, in which he\nargued that, despite Schmitt\u2019s attempts to do otherwise, Schmitt\nstill remained within the horizon of modern liberalism because he was\nunable to offer reasons for his normative commitment to what he called\n\u201cthe political.\u201d Many of Strauss\u2019s subsequent\ncritics have interpreted his claim that Schmitt remained a liberal as\nproof of what they consider Strauss\u2019s anti-liberal ire. However,\nStrauss\u2019s critique of Schmitt is perhaps better understood as\nevidence of what would be Strauss\u2019s life long worry about modern\nliberalism\u2019s ability to justify its normative commitment to\nliberal ideals in the face of moral skepticism, relativism and what\nStrauss also called \u201cphilistinism,\u201d all of which say \u201cin effect that\none does not have to think about the reasons why those things [of\nliberalism] are good\u201d (WPP, 21). If the modern liberal state is\nimpartial to questions of value, how then does the liberal state\njustify its own value? Schmitt would state that no one had understood\nhim as Strauss had, and Strauss would later claim that reading Schmitt\nchanged his own orientation toward the question of the relation\nbetween philosophy and politics.\n\nIn 1932, due to the financial problems of the Academy for the Science\nof Judaism, Strauss found himself without a job. With a letter of\nrecommendation from Schmitt, he received a fellowship from the\nRockefeller Foundation to begin work, in France, on a study of Hobbes.\nIn Paris, Strauss attended seminars on Hegel led by Alexandre\nKoyr\u00e9 (1892\u20131964) and Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve\n(1902\u20131968). The next year, he received an extension on his\nRockefeller grant to work in London and Cambridge on his book on\nHobbes.\n\nStrauss\u2019s work on Hobbes coincided with Hitler\u2019s rise to\npower. Strauss thus turned his attention to Hobbes, whom he took to be\nthe founding theorist of the liberal state, just as the idea of the\nGerman liberal state seemed to be collapsing. Strauss\u2019s third\nbook, The Political Philosophy of Hobbes: Its Basis and Its\nGenesis was published in 1936. Linking his newly found attention\nto the relation between philosophy and politics with his previous work\non what he regarded as Spinoza\u2019s critique of religion, the book\nconcerns what Strauss claimed was the intimate tie between modern\nliberalism and its critique of religion.\n\nIn 1935 Strauss had published his second book, Philosophy and Law:\nContributions to the Understanding of Maimonides and his\nPredecessors. Here too the political realities within which he\nwas living overlapped with his scholarly pursuits. At the urging of\nGershom Scholem, Strauss turned three separate essays on Maimonides\ninto a book. Scholem and Strauss hoped that the publication of\nPhilosophy and Law would help Strauss to get a position in\nmedieval Jewish philosophy at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nStrauss did not receive the position, which went instead to Julius\nGuttmann, Strauss\u2019s supervisor at the Academy for the Science of\nJudaism and a primary target of critique in Philosophy and\nLaw.\n\nMuch of Philosophy and Law is an attack on Guttmann\u2019s\nassumption that the central problem for medieval Jewish philosophy was\nepistemological in nature. According to Guttmann, the fundamental\nquestion in studying medieval Jewish philosophy was how medieval\nJewish philosophers, and Maimonides in particular, understood the\nrelation between reason and revelation as sources of knowledge.\nStrauss argued, in contrast, that Maimonides\u2019 basic concern was\nnot epistemological but instead political. Before any questions about\nthe basis of knowledge can be asked, the question of what it means to\nphilosophize in the framework of the authority of the law must be\nanswered. Strauss argued that philosophy can clarify the meaning of\nthe law, but philosophy cannot derive the law itself. Instead, the law\nis the pre-philosophical context of and framework for philosophy. It\nwas also within the context of Philosophy and Law that\nStrauss began to consider something he had up until then thought\nimpossible: a return to pre-modern philosophy.\n\nIn 1937 Strauss accepted a visiting lectureship in history from\nColumbia University. The following year Strauss became a visiting\nresearcher at the New School for Social Research, home to many\nEuropean \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Strauss\u2019s position at the New\nSchool became permanent, and he remained there for ten years.\n\nThe decade that Strauss spent at the New School was arguably the most\nproductive, and certainly the most pivotal, of his intellectual\ncareer. In his first years at the New School, Strauss published the\nseminal essays that would become the book Persecution and the Art\nof Writing, published in 1952. In these essays, Strauss argued\nthat, when reading certain pre-modern thinkers, it is necessary to\nread between the lines. The possibility of persecution gives rise to a\ncertain type of writing that allows one set of the readers, the\nmajority, to receive one message while allowing a second set of\nreaders, the philosophical elite, to take away another message. While\nthis type of writing is often referred to as \u201cesoteric,\u201d\nit is more properly understood as \u201cexoteric,\u201d that is,\nwriting that outwardly veils a secret teaching of some sort. For\nStrauss, Maimonides, Judah Halevi, and Spinoza were all exoteric\nwriters. Despite the profound differences between them, Maimonides and\nSpinoza both outwardly teach that philosophy and revelation are\nreconcilable with one another. Yet, according to Strauss, the careful\nreader will notice that their respective arguments actually suggest\nthe opposite: that philosophy and revelation are in fact\nirreconcilable. Halevi, on the other hand, outwardly teaches that\nphilosophy and revelation are irreconcilable. But whereas\nHalevi\u2019s dismissal of philosophy in the face of revelation seems\nto suggest that philosophy is not a challenge for revelation, Strauss\nargues that the careful reader will notice that Halevi\u2019s\nargument in fact suggests the opposite: that philosophy is not just a\nchallenge for revelation but a supremely dangerous one.\n\nDuring his New School years, Strauss also delved more deeply into\nancient philosophy to explore the themes of persecution and writing.\nStrauss\u2019s fourth book, On Tyranny: An Interpretation of\nXenophon\u2019s \u201cHiero,\u201d was published in 1948.\nWhereas the dominant reading of Plato\u2019s Republic understands\nPlato to be advocating that philosophers should rule, Strauss argues\nthat Plato actually viewed such a situation as untenable since it\nwould require the consent of non-philosophers, the unwise. \nOn Tyranny concerns itself with what Strauss claims is the\nnecessary condition for the rule of the wise which is that\nonly the wise alone can secure justice for the city (OT,\n193).  In this study, Strauss offers a close reading of the\nrhetoric of Xenophon\u2019s dialogue, which highlights, for Strauss,\nthe tension between the philosophical quest for truth and the\nrequirements of society.\n\nStrauss accepted a position at the University of Chicago in 1949,\nwhere he would teach until his retirement in 1967. Upon joining\nChicago\u2019s faculty, Strauss gave a series of lectures on\n\u201cNatural Right and History,\u201d which would be published in\n1953 under the same title. Natural Right and History remains\nStrauss\u2019s best-known American work but its basic worry is an\nextension of his early doubts about the ability of twentieth-century\nphilosophy to respond to the challenges of political and moral\nrelativism. In the United States, and in the department of political\nscience at Chicago, Strauss criticized what he took to be the moral\nrelativism upon which the social sciences rested. He begins the book\nwith an analysis of Max Weber, one of the principle founders of the\nacademic discipline of social science, and attempts to show a direct\nline leading from Weber\u2019s positivism to historicism, which\nStrauss defines as the view that \u201call human thoughts or beliefs\nare historical\u201d (NRH, p. 25). He then contrasts modern\nconceptions of natural right, beginning with Hobbes, with ancient\nconceptions, beginning with Plato. The former, argues Strauss, ends in\nhistoricist relativism, in which there are no moral, political, or\nscientific standards beyond particular historical contexts.\nNatural Right and History asks, though does not answer, the\nquestion of whether it is possible to return to some concept of nature\nfor understanding who we are as human beings and therefore to some\nnotion of absolute moral standards.\n\nStrauss published two other books and many essays in his later years.\nIn 1958 he published what is likely his most controversial study,\nThoughts on Machiavelli, in which he pronounced\nMachiavelli\u2019s \u201canti-theological ire\u201d the source of\nmodernity. After retiring from Chicago, Strauss taught at Claremont\nMen\u2019s College in California for a year and then joined his old\nfriend Jacob Klein (1899\u20131978) at St. John\u2019s College in\nAnnapolis as a scholar in residence. Strauss died in 1973. The\nArgument and Action of Plato\u2019s \u201cLaws\u201d was\npublished posthumously in 1975. At the time of his death, Strauss had\nalso been at work on studies of Nietzsche, Thucydides, and Xenophon. A\nnumber of important collections of Strauss\u2019s essays have since\nbeen edited and published by some of his former students.\n2. Controversies\n\nA number of controversies surround Strauss and his work. First, in\nrecent years, Strauss has been accused of being the intellectual\ngodfather of the neo-conservative political movement and thus of being\nthe intellectual force behind the Bush administration\u2019s plan to\ninvade of Iraq. Second, no aspect of Strauss\u2019s work is as hotly\ncontested as his claims about esotericism. Interpretations of\nStrauss\u2019s view of esotericism include: that Strauss advocates\nclandestine cabals with secrets imparted from teacher to disciple;\nthat Strauss\u2019s writings are themselves esoteric documents; that\nStrauss thinks that all thinkers write esoterically; that Strauss\nclaims to know a secret; that, Strauss promoted mass deception and\nperpetual war; and that, in one particularly crude rendering, Strauss\nused his esoteric methods to hide his fascist sympathies, if not his\nsecret Nazism. After exploring the broad themes and context of\nStrauss\u2019s work, this article will return to reconsider these\nvarying claims about Strauss.\n3. Esotericism\n\nStrauss\u2019s claims about esotericism ought to be understood within\nthe broader trajectory of his life\u2019s work. Such an approach is\nin fact in keeping with Strauss\u2019s own recommendation for how to\nread philosophical texts, esoteric or otherwise. According to Strauss,\nan interpretation of a given text must begin \u201cfrom an exact\nconsideration of the explicit statements of an author.\u201d However,\n\u201cThe context in which a statement occurs\u2026must be\nperfectly understood before an interpretation of the statement can\nreasonably claim to be adequate or even correct\u201d (PAW, p. 130).\nTurning to the context of Strauss\u2019s claims about esotericism\nhelps to unravel a number of other important themes in his work,\nincluding what he calls the \u201ctheologico-political predicament of\nmodernity,\u201d the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns,\nand the relation between revelation and philosophy (what Strauss also\ncalls \u201cJerusalem and Athens\u201d).\n\nIn his first published contention that Maimonides is an esoteric\nwriter, Strauss self-consciously examines what it means to write\nabout an esoteric text. Clearly referring to himself, Strauss\nwrites:\n\nNo historian who has a sense of decency and therefore a sense of\nrespect for a superior man such as Maimonides will disregard\nlight-heartedly the latter\u2019s emphatic entreaty not to explain\nthe secret teaching of the Guide. It may fairly be said that\nan interpreter who does not feel pangs of conscience when attempting\nto explain that secret teaching and perhaps when perceiving for the\nfirst time its existence and bearing lacks that closeness to the\nsubject which is indispensable for the true understanding of any book.\nThus the question of adequate interpretation of the Guide is\nprimarily a moral one. (PAW, p. 55)\n\n\nStrauss maintains that before attempting to answer the question of\nwhether a secret teaching, only hinted at in the text, can be grasped\nwith confidence and precision, it is necessary to consider the moral\nimplications as well as the moral impetus of a writer willing to write\nabout such a secret. In making this claim, Strauss aligns his own\ndilemma with Maimonides\u2019 dilemma and by so doing he points to\nthe basic motivation that directs his own claims about esotericism.\nThe question is thus twofold: why did Maimonides write the\nGuide in the first place and why does Strauss write about\nesoteric writing? In answering the first question, Strauss notes that\nthe literary form of the Guide is a letter to\nMaimonides\u2019 gifted student Joseph, who, like many Jews of\nMaimonides\u2019 time, was traveling in far and distant lands:\n\u201cJoseph\u2019s departure was a consequence of his being a Jew\nin the Diaspora. Not a private need but only an urgent necessity of\nnation-wide bearing can have driven Maimonides to transgress an\nexplicit prohibition [to write about esoteric matters]. Only the\nnecessity of saving the law can have caused him to break the\nlaw\u201d (PAW, p. 49).\n\nIf this is Maimonides\u2019 reason, what is Strauss\u2019s? Strauss\nis willing to make the seemingly immoral and indecent move of\nrevealing the secrets of an esoteric text in order to save those\nsecrets. The secret that Strauss seeks to save is insight into the\npolitical, philosophical, and theological meaning of what he calls\n\u201ca forgotten type of writing.\u201d But why does Strauss care\nabout this forgotten type of writing? We can only answer this question\nby looking to Strauss\u2019s published work as a whole and to the\nplace of Persecution and the Art of Writing within this whole\nand to do so it is necessary to understand Strauss\u2019s most basic\nquestion, which concerns what he calls the \u201ctheologico-political\npredicament of modernity.\u201d\n\n4. The Theologico-Political Predicament of Modernity\n\nIn the 1965 preface to the English translation of Spinoza\u2019s\nCritique of Religion, Strauss describes the beginnings of his\nintellectual journey by stating that \u201cThis study of\nSpinoza\u2019s Theologico-Political Treatise was written\nduring the years 1925\u201328 in Germany. The author was a young Jew\nborn and raised in Germany who found himself in the grip of the\ntheologico-political predicament\u201d (SCR, p. 1). Also in 1965\nStrauss\u2019s The Political Philosophy of Hobbes was\npublished, with a new preface by the author, for the first time in\nGerman. There Strauss refers to the \u201ctheologico-political\nproblem,\u201d deeming it \u201cthe theme of my\nstudies\u201d (GS 3, p. 8).\n\nStrauss employs the term \u201ctheological-political\npredicament,\u201d to diagnose what he contends are the devastating\nphilosophical, theological, and political consequences of the early\nmodern attempt to separate theology from politics. However, Strauss in\nno way favors a return to theocracy or, like his contemporary Carl\nSchmitt, a turn toward political theology. Instead, Strauss attempts\nto recover classical political philosophy not to return to the\npolitical structures of the past but to reconsider ways in which\npre-modern thinkers thought it necessary to grapple and live with the\ntensions, if not contradictions that, by definition, arise from human\nsociety. For Strauss, a recognition, and not a resolution, of the\ntensions and contradictions that define human society is the necessary\nstarting point for philosophically reconstructing a philosophy,\ntheology, and politics of moderation, all of which, he claims, the\ntwentieth-century desperately needs.\n5. Philosophy and Revelation\n\nIn describing the \u201ctheological-political predicament\u201d\nStrauss continually returns to the questions of the epistemological\nand political status of revelation vis-\u00e0-vis philosophy. He\ncriticizes the modern critique of religion beginning in the\n17th century for advancing the idea that revelation and\nphilosophy should answer to the same scientific criteria, maintaining\nthat this notion brings meaningful talk of revelation to an end,\neither in the form of banishing revelation from conversation or in the\nform of so-called modern defenses of religion which only internalize\nthis banishment. Strauss\u2019s early musings on the\ntheologico-political predicament led him to a theme upon which he\nwould insist again and again: the irreconcilability of revelation and\nphilosophy (or the irreconcilability of what he would call elsewhere\nJerusalem and Athens or the Bible and Greek philosophy). Strauss\nmaintains that because belief in revelation by definition does not\nclaim to be self-evident knowledge, philosophy can neither refute nor\nconfirm revelation:\n\nThe genuine refutation of orthodoxy would require the proof that the\nworld and human life are perfectly intelligible without the assumption\nof a mysterious God; it would require at least the success of the\nphilosophical system: man has to show himself theoretically and\npractically as the master of the world and the master of his life; the\nmerely given must be replaced by the world created by man\ntheoretically and practically (SCR, p. 29).\n\n\nBecause a completed system is not possible, or at least not yet\npossible, modern philosophy, despite its self-understanding to the\ncontrary, has not refuted the possibility of revelation.\n\nOn Strauss\u2019s reading, the Enlightenment\u2019s so-called\ncritique of religion ultimately also brought with it, unbeknownst to\nits proponents, modern rationalism\u2019s self-destruction. Strauss\ndoes not reject modern science, but he does object to the\nphilosophical conclusion that \u201cscientific knowledge is the\nhighest form of knowledge\u201d because this \u201cimplies a\ndepreciation of pre-scientific knowledge.\u201d As he put it,\n\u201cScience is the successful part of modern philosophy or science,\nand philosophy is the unsuccessful part\u2014the rump\u201d (JPCM,\np. 99). Strauss reads the history of modern philosophy as beginning\nwith the elevation of all knowledge to science, or theory, and as\nconcluding with the devaluation of all knowledge to history, or\npractice. In Strauss\u2019s words: \u201cthe root of all modern\ndarkness from the seventeenth century on is the obscuring of the\ndifference between theory and praxis, an obscuring that first leads to\na reduction of praxis to theory (this is the meaning of so-called\n[modern] rationalism) and then, in retaliation, to the rejection of\ntheory in the name of praxis that is no longer intelligible as\npraxis\u201d (FPP, p. 66). Whereas in the seventeenth-century,\nHobbes, like Spinoza after him, depreciates pre-scientific knowledge\nin the name of science, Heidegger, in the twentieth-century,\ndepreciates scientific knowledge in the name of historicity. While\nmany philosophers (including Heidegger) have understood\nHeidegger\u2019s philosophy as breaking with modern rationalism,\nStrauss views Heidegger\u2019s philosophy as a logical outcome of\nthat same rationalism. According to Strauss, modern rationalism\nimplodes upon itself: what starts as a modern quest for delineating\nscientific standards in the name of certain knowledge leads to the\nconclusion that there are neither such standards nor such truths.\n\nStrauss argues that just as modern philosophy begins with an\nover-inflated sense of reason that privileges theory over practice and\nends with a radical historicism that denies any meaning to reason\noutside of history, so too, modern political philosophy\nbegins with the attempt to make the human being part of nature as\ndefined by science and ends by denying any notion of nature all\ntogether. For Strauss, these trajectories come together in the\ncoincidence of Heidegger\u2019s philosophy and his political\nmisadventures:\n\nThe crucial issue concerns the status of those permanent\ncharacteristics of humanity, such as the distinction between the noble\nand the base\u2026. It was the contempt for these permanencies which\npermitted the most radical historicist in 1933 to submit to, or rather\nto welcome, as a dispensation of fate, the verdict of the least wise\nand least moderate part of his nation\u2026 The biggest event of\n1933 would rather seem to have proved, if such proof was necessary,\nthat man cannot abandon the question of the good society\u2026.\n(WPP, pp. 26\u201327).\n\n\nStrauss does not mean to imply that National Socialism was inevitable.\nRather he means to investigate why there was no adequate rational,\nmoral response to the rise of National Socialism. It is here that\nthe modern crises of philosophy and theology meet in the modern crisis\nof politics. Neither modern political philosophy nor theology nor\nphilosophy had the critical resources to respond to the disintegration\nof the liberal state, the very political structure that was touted as\n\u201cthe opposite of\u2026 \u2018the kingdom of darkness,\u2019\ni.e., of medieval society\u201d (SCR, p. 3).\n\nIt would become the mature Strauss\u2019s task to consider how\nphilosophy, theology, and political philosophy could each once again\nhave the critical resources to make the most basic distinction between\nthe noble and the base. To do so, Strauss would have to overcome what\nhe called the \u201cpowerful prejudice, that a return to pre-modern\nphilosophy is impossible\u201d (SCR, p. 31).\n6. Esotericism Revisited\n\nWe are now in a position to reconsider Strauss\u2019s claims about\nesotericism. In a 1936 essay on the political science of Maimonides\nand Farabi, Strauss returns to the meaning of prophecy for Maimonides.\nWhile most interpreters, including Strauss in Spinoza\u2019s\nCritique of Religion and in parts but not all of Philosophy\nand Law, viewed Maimonides\u2019 conception of prophecy in\nepistemological terms, Strauss argues that Maimonides\u2019\ninnovation was to think of prophecy in political terms. According to\nStrauss, \u201cMaimonides neither wished nor was able, nor had any\nneed, to lift the veil which conceals the origins of the Torah, the\nfoundation of the perfect nation\u201d (RPSMF, pp. 15\u201316). Yet,\nStrauss maintains, the attentive reader will notice that Maimonides\ndistinguishes between Moses, the lawgiver, and all other prophets.\nMaimonides stresses Moses\u2019 exalted status, argues Strauss,\nbecause for Maimonides Moses is the Platonic philosopher-legislator.\nThe emphasis on the uniqueness of Moses as the ideal prophet and ideal\nruler is the core of Maimonides\u2019 political philosophy because\n\u201cNot the mystery of its [the Torah\u2019s] origin, the search\nfor which leads either to theosophy or \u2018Epicureanism,\u2019 but\nits end, the comprehension of which guarantees obedience to the Torah,\nis accessible to human reason\u201d (RPSMF, p. 16).\n\nObedience to the law and the philosophical meaning of the law are two\ndifferent matters that are reflected in what Strauss argues is\nMaimonides\u2019 dual conception of law. The exterior, literal\nmeaning of the law serves to sustain the political community in which\ncertain forms of behavior and belief are required, while the ideal\nmeaning of the law is a matter of philosophical speculation only for\nthose who are capable of such speculation. This dual conception of law\nparallels the dual character of Maimonides\u2019 writing, which\noffers what Strauss calls a \u201cmoderate\u201d reading meant for\nthe masses and what he calls a \u201cradical\u201d reading meant for\nthe philosophical reader. As Strauss would elaborate just two years\nlater in greater detail, this dialectical tension lies at the heart of\nMaimonides\u2019 style of writing and argumentation.\n\nAccording to Strauss, Maimonides is able to properly balance the\nrelation between praxis, obedience to the law, and theory, the mystery\nof the law\u2019s origins, not by conflating them but by keeping them\nin continual dialectical tension. For Strauss, Maimonides\u2019\nrefusal to resolve the tension between law and philosophy (between\npraxis and theory) expresses Maimonides\u2019 moderate claims both\nfor what philosophy can produce on its own (it cannot produce the law)\nand for what revelation can claim to know absolutely (it cannot\nprovide certain knowledge of the mystery of its origin).\nStrauss\u2019s attention to esotericism is rooted in a philosophical\ninterest in \u201ca golden mean which is neither a compromise nor a\nsynthesis, which is hence not based on the two opposed positions, but\nwhich suppresses them both, uproots them by a prior, more profound\nquestion, by raising a fundamental problem, the work of a truly\ncritical philosophy\u201d (RPSMF, p. 4).\n\nFor Strauss, the work of a truly critical philosophy is to grasp\nproblems, and not to provide solutions. What is the absolute problem\nat the heart of esotericism, according to Strauss? The problem\nconcerns the self-sufficiency of reason or, put another way, the\ninescapable and necessary tension between theory and practice. The\ntheological-political predicament of modernity stems from the modern\ncommitment to the self-sufficiency of reason that, Strauss argues,\nresults in reason\u2019s self-destruction. Esotericism is a means\ntoward preserving the limits of philosophy and revelation (or law)\nvis-\u00e0-vis one another. The law comes up against its own\nlimitations in the quest to articulate the philosophical foundations\nof the law. But at the same time, philosophy comes up against its own\nlimits in recognizing that the philosopher is always already within\nsociety (or the law) and for this reason dependent upon the law.\nStrauss thus makes the seemingly immoral move of revealing\nMaimonides\u2019 art of writing for the sake of saving the\npossibility of both revelation and philosophy.\n7. The Quarrel between the Ancients and the Moderns\n\nAnother recurrent theme in Strauss\u2019s work is what he calls\n\u201cthe quarrel between the ancients and the moderns.\u201d Most\nspecifically, the quarrel between the ancients and the moderns for\nStrauss is about the excesses of modern claims for the authoritative\nclaims of reason and the philosophical moderation of the ancients. As\nwe saw above, according to Strauss, the trajectory of modern\nphilosophy\u2019s demise begins with the belief that modern\nphilosophy has refuted revelation once and for all. This false belief\nis based on an overreaching view of what philosophical reason alone\ncan accomplish and it leads to the equally false belief that there are\nno rational standards because reason is always imbedded within and\ndetermined by history. Strauss contrasts Socrates\u2019 moderation\nwith the excess of modern philosophers. Socrates\u2019 moderation is\nnot merely a political concession, according to Strauss, but bears\nupon the question of how we come to truth: \u201cSocrates implied\nthat disregarding the opinions about the nature of things would amount\nto abandoning the most important access to reality which we have, or\nthe most important vestiges of truth which are within our reach\u201d\n(NRH, p. 124). But even though truth is within our reach, philosophy\nbegins and ends with the quest for truth: \u201cphilosophy\nis meant\u2014and that is the decisive point\u2014not as a set of\npropositions, a teaching, or even a system, but as a way of life, a\nlife animated by a peculiar passion, the philosophic desire, or\neros; it is not understood as an instrument or a department\nof human self-realization\u201d (NRH, p. 122). As a way of life,\n\u201cthe problems are always more evident than the solutions. All\nsolutions are questionable\u2026 Therefore, the right way of life\ncannot be established metaphysically except by a completed\nmetaphysics, and therefore the right way of life remains\nquestionable\u201d (NRH, pp. 122\u2013123).\n8. Philosophy and Revelation Revisited\n\nThat the right way of life remains questionable and hence the claim\nfor philosophy\u2019s modesty regarding its own capabilities brings\nus back to philosophy\u2019s relation to revelation. Without a\ncompleted metaphysics, philosophy cannot refute revelation. This\ninability to refute revelation has serious consequences for\nphilosophy\u2019s self-understanding. As Strauss puts it in\nNatural Right and History, in what is probably his most well\nknown statement on the topic:\n\nPhilosophy has to grant that revelation is possible. But to grant that\nrevelation is possible means to grant that the philosophic life is not\nnecessarily, not evidently, the right life. Philosophy, the\nlife devoted to the quest for evident knowledge available to man as\nman, would rest on an unevident, arbitrary, or blind decision. This\nwould merely confirm the thesis of faith, that there is no possibility\nof consistency, of a consistent and thoroughly sincere life, without\nbelief in revelation. The mere fact that philosophy and revelation\ncannot refute each other would constitute the refutation of philosophy\nby revelation. (NRH, p. 75)\n\n\nHere we see that, for Strauss, the tension between revelation and\nphilosophy is not one between irrationality and rationality but\nbetween fundamentally irreconcilable criteria for what constitutes the\nrational starting point of truth. Philosophy begins and ends\nfor Strauss with the philosopher\u2019s sense of wonder, while\nrevealed religion begins and ends with adherence to the divine law.\nYet as Strauss suggests, this situation puts philosophy at a\ndisadvantage and revelation at an advantage. Never claiming to rest on\nevident knowledge, revelation can rationally approach its truth\nclaims, not to prove them but to understand them. But philosophy,\nwhich values reason first and foremost, is led to the unpleasant truth\nthat it is in fact predicated on something that is and remains\nunevident: that the human question for knowledge is the right\nlife.\n\nStrauss\u2019s simultaneous criticism of the self-sufficiency of\nreason and defense of the rational plausibility (though not the\ncertainty) of revelation bears an important affinity to arguments of\ncontemporary Christian philosophers of religion, such as Alvin\nPlantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff, who point out that philosophers\nand others take many things for granted for which we do not have\ncertain evidence, such as sense perception, memory, or the inner lives\nof other people. Like Strauss, these philosophers of religion\ncriticize the hubris of Enlightenment attempts to define knowledge\nonly in terms of scientific evidence. Once we dispense with modern\nphilosophy\u2019s overreaching claims for reason, the fact that\nrevelation cannot be proven definitively does not rule out the\npossibility of making rational arguments about God\u2019s revelation.\nSuch arguments become impossible only when absolute proof for\nGod\u2019s existence is the prerequisite for reasoning about\nrevelation.\n\nHowever, unlike Plantinga and Wolterstorff, Strauss\u2019s project is\nnot to make rational arguments for God\u2019s revelation but only to\nsuggest that such arguments are in theory possible. Because Strauss\nclearly is not interested in offering a constructive theology, some\ninterpreters have concluded that, despite appearances to the contrary,\nhe did not really take the possibility of revelation seriously.\nPerhaps most notably, the eminent Strauss scholar, Heinrich Meier,\nmaintains that Strauss purposely overstates the problem posed by\nrevelation for philosophy in order to inspire philosophical readers in\ntheir quest for the philosophical life. Meier further understands the\ntheologico-political problem in terms of what he claims is\nStrauss\u2019s life-long effort to create a philosophical school.\nMeier\u2019s basic contention is that the quarrel between revelation\nand philosophy as Strauss describes it leaves the careful reader many\nopportunities to consider whether revelation really does constitute\nthe refutation of philosophy and to realize that philosophy does in\nfact have philosophical and moral resources from which to respond to\nrevelation.\n\nIt is true that some of Strauss\u2019s sketches of revelation do not\nmake revelation compelling from a philosophical point of view. If the\nquestion about the relation between revelation and philosophy pertains\nto a decision for faith or philosophy, Strauss\u2019s conception of\nrevelation sounds very much like Kierkegaard\u2019s conception\naccording to which a leap of faith defines revelation. This\ntheological vantage point is similar to Strauss\u2019s description of\nFranz Rosenzweig and Karl Barth\u2019s reawakening of theology. Yet\nStrauss explicitly rejects this sort of theological decisionism\nbecause, he argues, this position amounts to a \u201cfarewell to\nreason.\u201d By mistakenly assuming that Strauss defines revelation\nas blind faith, many of Strauss\u2019s interpreters have concluded\nthat he does not in the end take revelation seriously from a\nphilosophical point of view. In support of this position, Meier in\nfact quotes Julius Guttmann\u2019s critical response to Strauss,\nwhich is that Strauss shows an \u201cindifference towards the content\nof revelation\u2026 Whether Jewish or Christian revelation is of\nconcern makes no difference whatsoever\u201d (as quoted in Meier\n2006, p. 20). For Guttmann, this supposed indifference to\nrevelation\u2019s content means that Strauss gets medieval Jewish\nrationalism wrong. For Meier, this supposed indifference means that\ndespite what seems to be Strauss\u2019s defense of revelation\u2019s\ncapacity to criticize philosophy, revelation is in the end for Strauss\na straw man. As Meier puts it, \u201cWhat appears to the believer to\nbe \u2018indifference\u2019 proves on closer inspection to be a\nconscious dissociation and ultimately a rejection\u201d (Meier 2006,\np. 20, note 25). \n\nYet Strauss was not indifferent to the content of revelation and\ncertainly not to the difference between Jewish and Christian notions\nof revelation. In fact, Strauss strongly criticizes what he regards as\na particularly Christian view of revelation not in order to banish\nrevelation from intellectual conversation once and for all but to\nsuggest that modernity\u2019s intellectual ills stem in large part\nfrom the legacy of Christian theology. In a 1952 letter to Gershom\nScholem, Strauss rejects his early reading of Maimonides in\nPhilosophy and Law as the \u201cJewish equivalence of Thomas\nAquinas.\u201d  Describing the development of his views on Maimonides,\nStrauss writes to Scholem that he has \u201cmoved, so to speak, contrary to\nG.\u2019s [Guttmann\u2019s] moderate rationalism\u2026to\n\u2018radical\u2019 rationalism\u201d (GS 3, 728).  Strikingly, it was on\nthe basis of the Islamic, as opposed to the Christian, reception of\nclassical political philosophy that Strauss turned to the possiblity\nof \u201cradical rationalism\u201d by reconsidering the meanings of philosophy,\nrevelation, and politics.  Strauss\u2019s very attempt to move beyond\nmodern philosophy is predicated on a distinction between the Jewish\nand Islamic conception of revelation on the one hand, and the\nChristian conception, on the other hand:\n\nFor the Christian, the sacred doctrine is revealed theology; for the\nJew and the Muslim, the sacred doctrine is, at least primarily the\nlegal interpretation of the Divine Law (talmud or\nfiqh). The sacred doctrine in the latter sense has, to say\nthe least, much less in common with philosophy than the sacred\ndoctrine in the former sense. It is ultimately for this reason that\nthe status of philosophy was, as a matter of principle, much more\nprecarious in Judaism and in Islam than in Christianity: in\nChristianity philosophy became an integral part of the officially\nrecognized and even required training of the student of the sacred\ndoctrine\u2026.The precarious position of philosophy in the\nIslamic-Jewish world guaranteed its private character and therewith\nits inner-freedom from supervision. The status of philosophy in the\nIslamic-Jewish world resembled in this respect its status in classical\nGreece. (PAW, pp. 18\u201319, 21)\n\n\nStrauss problematizes the Christian view of revelation as doctrinal\nknowledge that must be believed. From his early to his mature\nwritings, Strauss contends that the making of revelation into\nknowledge in scholastic theology ultimately led to modern\nphilosophy\u2019s far too over-reaching claims. As Strauss puts it\nrather succinctly, \u201cOn the querelle des anciens et des\nmodernes: I do not deny, but assert, that modern philosophy has\nmuch that is essential in common with Christian medieval philosophy;\nbut that means that the attack of the moderns is directed\ndecisively against ancient philosophy\u201d (CCM, p. 106).\nOr, as he puts it elsewhere, \u201cmodern philosophy emerged by way\nof transformation of, if in opposition to, Latin or Christian\nscholasticism\u201d (JPCM, p. 252).\n\nStrauss\u2019s distinction between Judaism and Islam, on the one\nhand, and Christianity, on the other, is decisive for understanding\nhis conception of the relation between Jerusalem and Athens as well as\nfor appreciating his conception of the theologico-political problem,\nas a diagnosis of modernity\u2019s philosophical, theological, and\npolitical ills. On an epistemological level, philosophy may well have\ngood arguments to make in response to revelation. Strauss explicitly\ncriticizes what he regards as Rosenzweig\u2019s and Karl\nBarth\u2019s decisionist conception of revelation, i.e. revelation as\na leap of faith, which, he maintains, holds no promise of rationalism.\nFrom an epistemological point of view, philosophy understood as a way\nof life, concerned with problems and unconvinced of promises of\nabsolute solutions, will appear more rational to potential\nphilosophers.\n\nYet for Strauss the serious argument with which revelation challenges\nphilosophy is not epistemological but moral. This is not to deny the\nimportance of the pursuit of truth for Strauss, but it is to return to\nhis criticism of the modern depreciation of pre-scientific or\npre-philosophical knowledge. Again, Strauss is a critic of the\nEnlightenment\u2019s view of the self-sufficiency of reason. If\nphilosophy is to have critical potential, argues Strauss, philosophy\nmust be skeptical even of itself. This means that philosophers should\nnot only tolerate religion for their own instrumental purposes but\nthat philosophy is challenged by revelation, understood as law and not\nas knowledge, on moral grounds.\n9. Strauss\u2019s Moral Argument for Revelation\n\nStrauss argues, both in his early work on medieval Jewish rationalism\nand in his mature American work, that only revelation, and not\nphilosophy, can provide the basis of a universal morality. To be sure,\nthis universal morality is based on faith and not certain knowledge.\nNevertheless, it does underscore a moral weakness in the philosophical\nposition. Nowhere does Strauss highlight this point more than in his\nseminal 1943 essay on the medieval Jewish thinker Judah Halevi. This\nessay became an integral part of Persecution and the Art of\nWriting and far from an obscure relic of an interest in things\nJewish and medieval, Strauss\u2019s reference to this essay forms a\ndecisive part of his argument in Natural Right and\nHistory.\n\nStrauss\u2019s reading of Halevi centers on the question of what\nHalevi, in his Kuzari, could have meant by the \u201claw of\nreason.\u201d Through a detailed analysis of the Halevi\u2019s\nKuzari, Strauss concludes, \u201cthe iura naturalia\nare really not more than the indispensable and unchangeable minimum of\nmorality required for the bare existence of any society.\u201d But as\nStrauss points out, the unchangeable minimum of morality is in fact,\nfrom a moral point of view, not very much after all. In explicating\nHalevi\u2019s position, Strauss elaborates on Halevi\u2019s comment\nin the Kuzari that \u201cEven a gang of robbers must have a\nkind of justice among them if their confederacy is to last,\u201d\n(the analogy refers to, without mentioning, Plato\u2019s parable of\nthe robbers in Republic, Book 1, 342b-d). Strauss writes:\n\nhe [the philosopher in Halevi\u2019s Kuzari] mentions among\nthe governmental laws of the Divine code the prohibition against\nmurder, e.g. while he does not mention it among the governmental and\nrational nomoi which are known independently of revelation; this again\nis easily understandable considering that the Bible prohibits murder\nabsolutely, whereas a gang of robbers, e.g., would merely have to\nprohibit the murder of other members of the gang. (PAW, p. 132)\n\n\nStrauss concludes his study of Halevi by suggesting that \u201cby\ngoing so far with the philosophers\u2026he [Halevi] discover[s] the\nfundamental weakness of the philosophic position and the deepest\nreason why philosophy is enormously dangerous\u201d (PAW, p. 140). On\nStrauss\u2019s reading of Halevi, philosophy leads to the dangerous\ndenial of an absolute morality that is not contingent upon allegiance\nto a specific group.\n\nIn Natural Right and History Strauss does not deny that we\ncan know right and wrong, but he does question strongly whether\nphilosophy in and of itself can defend a universal morality beyond\nthat of a closed city or society. Significantly, Strauss alludes to\nHalevi\u2019s analogy of a gang of robbers when he writes:\n\nBut it is unfortunate for the defenders of justice that it is also\nrequired for the preservation of a gang of robbers: the gang could not\nlast a single day if its members did not refrain from hurting one\nanother, if they did not help one another, or if each member did not\nsubordinate his own good to the good of the gang (NRH, p. 105).\n\n\nStrauss\u2019s allusion to Halevi is made all the stronger by a\nreference to his essay on Halevi in a note to the following sentence:\n\u201cThere exists an alternative medieval interpretation of\nAristotle\u2019s doctrine [of natural right], namely, the Averroistic\nview or, more adequately stated, the view characteristic of the\nfal\u0101sia, as well as of the Jewish Aristotelians\u201d (NRH, p.\n158). The context of this comment and note is Strauss\u2019s\ndistinction between the Aristotelian view of natural right and the\nSocratic-Platonic view. For Aristotle, Strauss writes, \u201cthere is\nno fundamental disproportion between natural right and the\nrequirements of political society\u201d (NRH, p. 156). In contrast,\nStrauss maintains, the Platonic-Socratic view of natural right\nrecognizes a fundamental discrepancy between the justice of natural\nright, which is independent of law, and the justice of the city, which\nis of necessity dependent on law. The Platonic-Socratic view of\nnatural right points to the philosopher\u2019s lack of inner\nattachment to the laws of society.\n\nFor Strauss, the \u201cAverroistic view\u201d that is \u201can\nalternative medieval interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s\ndoctrine\u201d is based on the Islamic reception of Plato\u2019s\nLaws and hence is Platonic in a way that the Christian\nreading of Aristotle is not. Plato and the \u201cJewish\nAristotelians,\u201d Strauss insists, recognize a fundamental tension\nbetween philosophy and law, which is also the tension between\nphilosophy and \u201cthe city.\u201d As Strauss makes clear in\nNatural Right and History, it is the Christian interpretation\nof Aristotle, and particularly Thomas Aquinas\u2019 notion of natural\nlaw, that denies this tension: \u201cThe Thomistic doctrine of\nnatural right or, more generally expressed, of natural law is free\nfrom the hesitations and ambiguities which are characteristic of the\nteachings, not only of Plato and Cicero, but of Aristotle as\nwell\u2026. No doubt is left\u2026\u201d (NRH, p. 163). We have\nseen that for Strauss, leaving doubt behind is the intellectual error\nthat led to the theologico-political predicament of the early\ntwentieth-century, with ultimately terrible consequences for reason,\nmorality, and politics.\n\nBy repeatedly emphasizing his doubts about philosophy\u2019s ability\nto ground a universal morality, Strauss suggests that revelation\nremains and must remain a continual moral challenge for philosophy\n(see also JPCM; NRH, pp. 106\u2013107; PAW, p. 140). To be sure,\nStrauss\u2019s is not an argument for revelation. And\nStrauss himself was not a believer. But Strauss\u2019s arguments\nabout revelation do offer the believer intellectual resources with\nwhich to challenge the philosopher and for this reason Strauss is\nneither indifferent to nor does he reject revelation. As Strauss\nconcludes his essay on Halevi, \u201cOne has not to be naturally\npious, he has merely to have a passionate interest in genuine morality\nin order to long with all his heart for revelation: moral man as such\nis the potential believer\u201d (PAW, p. 140, emphasis added).\n\nOf course, revelation\u2019s challenge to philosophy is but a\nchallenge and never a victory. At the same time, philosophy always\nremains a challenge to revelation\u2019s ability to make claims about\nconclusive evidence for revelation\u2019s truth. This mutual\nchallenge is ultimately a form of moderation. \n\nWhile many scholars still see Strauss as clearly siding with Athens\n(Meier 2006; Velkley 2011; Lampert 2013), recent scholarship has\ncontinued to debate which side of the divide Strauss finds most\nconvincing.  Some argue that Strauss uncovers \u201cPlato as the\nfundamental philosophical ally of the standpoint of Jerusalem, which\nrejects the project of a philosophical or scientific foundation of\nethics in favor of its foundsion in divine revelation as law\u201d (Vatter,\np. 206).  Others contend that Strauss\u2019s \u201cengagement with\nJersualem is itself an aspect of philosophy as a contemplative way of\nlife\u201d (Bernstein, p. xxii).   And still others maintain that\nStrauss shared with Maimonides \u201cThe struggle to bring about a grerater\namount of harmony through a fertile tension [between philosophy and\nthe life of Torah], in individual human beings and thus in collective\nhuman affairs\u201d (Green 2013, p. 87). \n10. Controversies Revisited\n\nLet us return to the controversies surrounding Strauss and his work,\nmentioned above. The claim that Strauss is in some way responsible for\nthe Bush administration\u2019s decision to invade Iraq has little\nmerit. As should be clear from the above, Strauss\u2019s work does\nnot concern policy issues of any sort. If others have adapted his\nphilosophical ideas in the pursuit of policy questions, they\nthemselves are responsible for those policy decisions, not Strauss.\nMorever, few, if any, real arguments have been advanced that conclude\nBush administration policy makers who studied with Strauss\u2019s\nstudents ever consciously applied his ideas when making decisions\nconcerning the war in Iraq. In the context of such claims about\nStrauss\u2019s influence on the Bush administration\u2019s policies\non Iraq and the Middle East more generally, there is an irony, namely,\nthat Strauss himself was devoted to revitalizing Islamic philosophy,\nas opposed to Christian thought, for the very sake of the future of\nwestern civilization.\n\nAppreciating the centrality of Strauss\u2019s concern with the\ntheologico-political predicament allows us also to reconsider claims\nabout his purported sympathy for fascism. In recent years, much has\nbeen made of a letter that the young Strauss wrote to his friend Karl\nL\u00f6with in 1933. Writing from Paris and reflecting on\nHitler\u2019s rise to power, Strauss wrote that it was only possible\nto \u201cprotest against the shabby abomination\u201d of Nazi\nGermany \u201cfrom the principles of the right, that is from fascist,\nauthoritarian, and imperial principles\u201d (GS 3, pp.\n624\u2013625). A number of Strauss\u2019s severest critics refer to\nthis letter as evidence of Strauss\u2019s fascism, if not Nazism.\nYet, as Robert Howse has concisely pointed out, \u201cIt requires\nonly a little care, and remembering the context of the letter, to\nunderstand that Strauss is not here affirming as true \u2018the\nprinciples of the right\u2019 but rather he is suggesting that they\nare the only effective basis on which Hitler (\u2019the shabby\nabomination\u2019) could be opposed in the present\ncircumstances\u201d (Howse 2012). Rather than an expression of\nsympathy for the fascist, imperial right of Hitler\u2019s Germany,\nStrauss\u2019s letter to L\u00f6with is further evidence of his life\nlong moral worry about liberal democracy\u2019s ability to offer a\ncoherent account of its own normative commitments.  It may even\nreflect Strauss\u2019s fundamental commitment to peace (Howse, 2014).\n\nThe variety of claims about Strauss\u2019s view of esotericism,\nmentioned above, is also fundamentally problematic. First, we have\nseen that a crucial, if usually overlooked, presupposition of\nStrauss\u2019s view of esotericism is his concern with\nwritten texts. From the perspective of his own claims about\nesotericism, what may or may not have been Strauss\u2019s own views\nare irrelevant to interpreting his work.\n\nSecond, there is no reason to conclude, as many do, that Strauss\nhimself wrote esoterically. For instance, Laurence Lampert\u2019s\nview that \u201cIt is reasonable to suspect that a partisan of\nesoteric philosophy [i.e. Strauss] would himself write\nesoterically\u201d (Lampert 2009, p. 63) simply does not follow from\nStrauss\u2019s own claims. In Strauss\u2019s words, \u201cThe only\npresentations of an author\u2019s views which can be accepted as true\nare those ultimately borne out by his own explicit statements\u201d\n(PAW, pp. 26\u201327). While Maimonides announces in the introduction\nto the Guide that he will write esoterically, Strauss makes\nno such statement. So too, in Strauss\u2019s words, \u201cthe\nproblem inherent in the surface of things, and only in the surface of\nthings, is the heart of things\u201d (TM, p. 13). Strauss tells us\nthat the theologico-political predicament is his focal issue. Why\nshould we, on the basis of Strauss\u2019s own terms, think\notherwise?\n\nThird, suggestions that Strauss reads a multitude of authors\nesoterically simply do not hold up. Strauss only uses the term\n\u201cesotericism\u201d in Persecution and the Art of\nWriting and hence only in connection with Halevi, Spinoza, and\nMaimonides.\n\nAnd fourth, Strauss never claims to have discovered any secret in\nMaimonides or anyone else, but rather an understanding of the\nnecessity and limits of philosophy as it relates to revelation and\npolitics.  Indeed, as Strauss put it to Guttmann in 1949, \u201cthe\nproblem in principle of esotericism\u201d is \u201cthe relationship between\nthought and society\u201d (as quoted in Meier, 24n32).  \n\nAll of these issues aside, the most persistent and serious\nmisunderstanding of Strauss is that he promotes mass deception. On\nthis reading, Strauss suggests that the masses simply cannot handle\nthe truth and are in need of a class of political elites who, while\nthemselves pursuing the truth, support the noble lies necessary for\nany society to function. If this was Strauss\u2019s view then, as\nMoshe Halbertal has recently and rightly noted, Strauss or \u201cthe\nStraussians are\u2026na\u00efve in believing that genuine elites can\nbe trusted. Trusting the existence of a selected group of wise men who\nare devoted to the collective good, and who are freed from ambition\nand self-interest because of their pursuit of truth, is as crude as\nthe belief in a society where masses disappear and deliberation and\nreason control human\u2019s political choices\u201d (CR, p. 163).\nHalbertal calls Strauss\u2019s conception of esotericism\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d because it \u201cfocuses on the harmful\nresults of the dissemination\u201d [of the truth] (CR, p. 149).\n\nYet if we understand Strauss\u2019s rather minimal claims about\nesotericism as an antidote to what he called the theologico-political\npredicament of modernity, then this reading of Strauss (regardless of\nwhat various Straussians claim) is not quite right. As we have seen,\nStrauss develops his conception of esotericism in an attempt to\nrethink the relation between theory and praxis. Esotericism is not\nmerely a political, or instrumental, tool for Strauss but also\nconcerns the very nature of truth. Esotericism points to what Strauss\nregards as the critical problem of philosophy, which concerns the\nself-sufficiency of reason. Halbertal is right that \u201cHumans,\neven those who devote themselves to truth, are always embedded within\nthe boundaries of the human condition\u201d (CR, p. 163). But this\nshould not be a criticism of Strauss but is better understood as\ndescribing the very impetus for the dialogical structure of\nStrauss\u2019s account of esotericism.\n\nAlthough he does not apply it to Strauss, Halbertal provides a more\nhelpful rubric under which we may better understand Strauss\u2019s\nconception of esotericism. Strauss\u2019s view of esotericism is not\n\u201cinstrumental\u201d but instead \u201cessential,\u201d which\nmeans that, to quote Halbertal, esotericism \u201cis not the result\nof a strategy adopted by philosophy in its relation toward society,\nbut is part of the essence of the philosophical realm\u201d (CR, p.\n57). As Halbertal notes, this position leads to a skeptical position\nthat Shlomo Pines (a professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University\nin Jerusalem from 1952\u20131990 and the translator of\nMaimonides\u2019 Guide of the Perplexed into English for\nwhich Strauss provided the introduction) attributed to Maimonides (in\nan article which, incidentally, he published after Strauss\u2019s\ndeath). While Pines\u2019 concern was specifically with\nMaimonides\u2019 account of language, Strauss saw esotericism as a\nmore generalized form of philosophical skepticism. To return to\nStrauss\u2019s abiding interest in the relation between theory and\npractice, Strauss\u2019s skepticism was also skeptical of itself in\nrecognizing the limits, political, moral, and philosophical, of\nskepticism. This recognition, for Strauss, is the work of a truly\ncritical philosophy.\n11. Remaining Problems with Strauss\u2019s Philosophy\n\nLeaving aside legitimate debate about the intellectual history of\nwestern civilization that Strauss sketches, problems remain with many\nof his philosophical contentions. Strauss certainly cannot be said to\nhave offered definitive arguments against historicism, definitive\narguments for or against revelation, or definitive arguments for a\nreturn to \u201cnature.\u201d Rather, in all these cases, one might\nargue, Strauss has merely begged the question. Strauss historicizes\nphilosophy in order to make an argument for timeless truth. His\nrational defenses of both the possibility of revelation and\nphilosophical rationalism are made on the basis of a critique of\nreason\u2019s self-sufficiency. Finally, Strauss\u2019s claims about\na return to \u201cnature\u201d rest not upon arguments for\n\u201cnature\u201d but rather upon arguments about the consequences\nof not having a conception of \u201cnature.\u201d\n\nIn the end, how one evaluates the circular nature of Strauss\u2019s\nquestions and answers will depend upon how seriously one takes\nStrauss\u2019s diagnosis of the \u201ctheologico-political\npredicament of modernity.\u201d If one does not think Strauss has\nmade a serious case for the dire intellectual and political\nimplications of this predicament, then one will not be persuaded that\nStrauss has done much more than creatively re-read some pre-modern\nphilosophers, for better or for worse. If on the other hand, one finds\nStrauss\u2019s diagnosis of the \u201ctheologico-political\npredicament\u201d persuasive, one might think that Strauss has\naccomplished quite a lot by raising the questions of truth,\nrevelation, and nature anew in a day and age in which discussion of\nthese matters seems to have been deemed moot.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works by Strauss", "Secondary Literature"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works by Strauss": ["</h3>\n<table class=\"cellpad-med; cell-right; vert-top\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>", "PL", "<em>The Argument and Action of Plato\u2019s Laws</em>, Chicago:\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1975. </tr>\n<tr>", "CCM", "\u201cCorrespondence Concerning Modernity,\u201d trans.
