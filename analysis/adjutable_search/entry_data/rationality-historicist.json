    "preamble": "\n\nMany scientists, philosophers, and laypersons have regarded science as\nthe one human enterprise that successfully escapes the contingencies\nof history to establish eternal truths about the universe, via a\nspecial, rational method of inquiry. Historicists oppose this view. In\nthe 1960s several historically informed philosophers of science\nchallenged the then-dominant accounts of scientific method advanced by\nthe Popperians and the positivists (the logical positivists and\nlogical empiricists) for failing to fit historical scientific practice\nand failing particularly to account for deep scientific change. While\nseveral strands of historicism originated in nineteenth-century\nhistoriography, this article focuses, first, on the historicist\nconceptions of scientific rationality that became prominent in the\n1960s and 1970s, as the maturation of the field of historiography of\nscience began to suggest competing models of scientific development,\nand, second, on recent approaches such as historical epistemology.\n\nThe \u201cBattle of the Big Systems\u201d of the 1960s and\n\u201870s, involving historicists such as Thomas Kuhn, Imre Lakatos,\nPaul Feyerabend, and Larry Laudan, eventually gave way to a realist\nreaction, as many philosophers rejected the perceived skepticism and\npotential relativism of the historicist movement, now reinforced by\nnew-wave sociology of science. The 1990s featured the so-called\nScience Wars, as philosophers attempted to defend truth, rationality,\nobjectivity, and scientific progress (and their own turf) from the\nperceived threats of rapidly developing, sociology-inspired science\nand technology studies and (other) postmodern influences. Since then,\na group of interdisciplinary scholars have attempted to reimagine ways\nin which historical and philosophical work can be brought together\nfruitfully.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Historicist Conceptions of Rationality: The Battle of the Big Systems\n1.1 Overview\n\nWhat good is appeal to history when it comes to evaluating the\nrationality of decisions and actions? Since the past is already over,\nisn\u2019t history simply \u201cbunk\u201d? A couple of everyday\nlocutions suggest otherwise. It is commonly held that\n\u201chistory\u201d (meaning historiography, the disciplined study\nof what happened in history) is a debunker of myths. And politicians\nare not the only people worried about \u201cthe judgment of\nhistory\u201d. Both these ideas came into play in the new\nhistorically-oriented philosophy of science that began to emerge at\nthe end of the 1950s. The \u201cnew historicists\u201d (as we may\ncall them) included Thomas Kuhn, N.R. Hanson, Mary Hesse, Imre\nLakatos, Paul Feyerabend, Stephen Toulmin, Dudley Shapere, Larry\nLaudan, Ernan McMullin, and Michael Ruse. They claimed that the\nthen-dominant positivist and Popperian accounts of science were\nthemselves bunk\u2014myths about how science is done. Some new\nhistoricists claimed to find larger units and a hitherto unnoticed\ndynamic in the time-series of the historical record\u2014long-term,\nforward-looking research programs that included evolving series of\nrelated theoretical moments. Above all, the historicists stressed the\ndepth of major historical changes and the resulting challenges to\ncumulative scientific progress. They argued that there was nothing in\nthe traditional \u201clogic of science\u201d that could rationalize\nsuch changes. The problem was to produce a new dynamical model of\nscience that would capture these patterns and rationally motivate\nthem.\n\nHistoricist philosophers did a convincing job of showing that\nhistorical evidence called the received views into question. Most\nphilosophers today accept that verdict of history. Less successful was\nthe attempt to formulate an adequate positive theory of rationality,\nboth at the first-order level of scientific methodological norms\n(e.g., \u201cReject a hypothesis that makes clearly false\npredictions\u201d or \u201cUse double-blind experimental methods\nwhen dealing with cognitive agents\u201d) and at the\nmetamethodological level, where they faced the problem of how to\nrationally select among competing theories of scientific rationality,\nwithout circularity. The disagreements here raised the question of\nwhether there is a general theory of scientific rationality\nto be found, or a need for one.\n\n(For accessible, critical summaries of the \u201cBig Systems\u201d\ndebate, see Suppe 1974, Newton-Smith 1981, McGuire 1992, and Zammito\n2004. Space limitations have forced the omission of important\ndevelopments, including the Marxist dialectical tradition, e.g., Nowak\n1980, and recent work on stance and rationality, e.g., van Fraassen\n2002, Rowbottom & Bueno 2011.) \n1.2 The Historical Turn in Philosophy of Science\n\nKuhn\u2019s Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962/1970a)\nwas the original manifesto of historicist philosophy of science and\nremains the primary reference point. His work thus provides the most\nuseful platform for recounting early historicist efforts\u2014and the\ndifficulties they faced. We shall then take a briefer look at other\nmajor contributors. Kuhn had been anticipated in quite diverse ways by\nKant, Hegel, William Whewell, \u00c9mile Meyerson, Ernst Cassirer,\nAlexandre Koyr\u00e9, Philipp Frank, Gaston Bachelard, Ludwik Fleck,\nHans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, W.V. Quine, Michael Polanyi, Hesse,\nToulmin, and Hanson and was immediately followed by Lakatos,\nFeyerabend, Shapere, Laudan, and others (see the entry on\n Thomas Kuhn;\n also Hoyningen-Huene [1989] 1993 and Rheinberger [2007] 2010b).\n\nThe famous opening sentence of Structure was:\n\n\nHistory, if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or\nchronology, could produce a decisive transformation in the image of\nscience by which we are now possessed. That image has previously been\ndrawn, even by scientists themselves, mainly from the study of\nfinished scientific achievements as these are recorded in the classics\nand, more recently, in the textbooks from which each new scientific\ngeneration learns to practice its trade. Inevitably, however, the aim\nof such books is persuasive and pedagogic; a concept of science drawn\nfrom them is no more likely to fit the enterprise that produced them\nthan an image of a national culture drawn from a tourist brochure or a\nlanguage text. This essay attempts to show that we have been misled by\nthem in fundamental ways. Its aim is a sketch of the quite different\nconcept of science that can emerge from the historical records of the\nresearch activity itself.\n\n\nKuhn modeled the history of a science as a succession of dogmatic\nperiods of \u201cnormal science\u201d under a\n\u201cparadigm\u201d, separated by \u201crevolutionary\u201d\ntransitions to the next paradigm. According to Kuhn such a break from\nthe past rejuvenates a field that had stagnated under the weight of\nanomalies that it no longer seemed to have the resources to solve. A\nnew paradigm introduces changes at all levels, from established\ndatabases and instrumentation to the conceptual framework, goals,\nstandards, institutional organization, and research culture\u2014so\nmuch so that some older practitioners can hardly recognize the new\nparadigm as their field. This disconnect produces\n\u201cincommensurability\u201d across paradigm change, ranging from\ncommunication failure to problems of rational choice between the two,\nsince there exists no fixed measure of success. At his most radical,\nKuhn modeled revolutionary decisions on political revolution at the\ncommunity level and on religious conversion at the individual level,\nadding that scientists on different sides of a paradigm debate\n\u201clive in different worlds\u201d ([1962] 1970a: ch. 10). Under\ncritical pressure, he subsequently softened his position. In fact, he sought\nto clarify the notion of incommensurability to the end of his life\n(Sankey 1997). Kuhn exemplifies the irony that, while historicists\nused deep change as a weapon to beat up traditionalists, it presented\nserious problems for the historicists themselves as well.\n\nKuhn\u2019s book was his attempt to answer the question posed by the\nabove quotation. This question immediately raised another: How can\nappeal to history achieve that transformative change? In particular,\nhow can descriptive claims about the past (or present\nscience, for that matter) affect our normative judgments\nabout rational beliefs and behaviors? How can history inform a\nmethodology of science? This is a version of the so-called\n\u201cis-ought\u201d problem. Can there really be a\n\u201cjudgment\u201d of history?\n\nOver the next decade or two, most philosophers of science came to\nagree that there was a disconnect between science as historically\npracticed and the normative models of the received philosophers. The\nhistoricists therefore presented the philosophical community with a\nmomentous dilemma: either reject most of science to date as irrational\nor else accept that science is generally rational and use the\nhistorical information to revise our deeply entrenched logical and\nprobabilistic conception of rationality. Some positivists and Popperians\nattempted to finesse option one by arguing that the history of science\napproximated the traditional view of rationality closely enough if we\ntreated their sanitized, abstract models of science as regulative\nideals. Kuhn and other historicists defended option two, taking the\nrationality of science to be practically axiomatic. Wrote Kuhn,\n\n\nI do not for a moment believe that science is an intrinsically\nirrational enterprise \u2026. I take this assertion not as a matter\nof fact, but rather of principle. Scientific behavior, taken as a\nwhole, is the best example we have of rationality. (1971: 143f; quoted\nby Hoyningen-Huhne [1989] 1993: 251f.)\n\n\nWhat was Kuhn\u2019s revised conception of rationality and how was it\nbased on history (to the degree that it was)? While he provided no\nexplicit, general theory of rationality, Kuhn\u2019s challenge here\nwas greater than many appreciate. The positivists and Popperians had\npractically invented modern, academic philosophy of science. For them,\nscientific rationality was wholly a matter of making correct theory\nacceptance decisions in context of justification, where the hypotheses\nand test data are already on the table, the data are theory-neutral,\nand the goals and standards are logically independent of theory. To\nKuhn this picture of science was more like a photographic negative in\nwhich light and dark are reversed. Let us count the ways.\n\n(1) Although his work deepened the problem of underdetermination by\ninsisting that logic plus data is insufficient to determine theory\nchoice, Kuhn reduced the magnitude of the problem of justifying\nscientific claims by rejecting traditional realism and the\ncorrespondence theory of truth. No longer must scientists justify a\ntheoretical claim as true. Instead, he adopted the Kantian critical\nposition that no enterprise, including science, has the ability to\nestablish the final, metaphysical truth about the world. Instead,\nscience is largely a problem-solving enterprise, and scientists\nare in position to evaluate the goodness of proposed problem\nsolutions, relative to previous attempts. \u201c[T]he unit of\nscientific achievement is the solved problem\u201d ([1962] 1970a:\n169). What demarcates science from nonscience and pseudoscience is\nsustained support (over historical time) of a puzzle-solving\ntradition, not the application of a nonexistent \u201cscientific\nmethod\u201d to determine whether the claims are true or false or\nprobable to some degree. With justified truth claims gone, new\naccounts of scientific discovery, knowledge, explanation, and progress\nwill also be needed.\n\n(2) Contrary to most empiricist views, the data are not\ntheory-neutral, hence not cumulative from one period of science to\nanother. \n\n(3) Moreover, Kuhn extended the claim that observation is theory laden\nto say that all major aspects of a science are laden by the\nothers. Substantive data and theoretical claims, methodological\nstandards, goals, and even the social institutions of science are all\nbound up in mutual dependence. (The received view had kept them\nseparate and independent in order to avoid mutual contamination\nallegedly leading to circularity; see Scheffler 1967.) It is this\ninternal feedback that introduces the interesting, nonlinear dynamics\ninto Kuhn\u2019s model, since the feedback produces coupled\ninteraction terms (Kuhn 1977: 336; Nickles 2013b; De Langhe\n2014b).\n\n(4) This tight coherence implies that normal science is conservative\nand closed, in contrast to Popper\u2019s science as an \u201copen\nsociety\u201d (Popper 1945). Contrary to tradition, said Kuhn,\nscientific rationality does not consist in advancing hypotheses and\ntesting them severely. To challenge the constitutive pillars of a\nscientific field, as Popper and the positivists advocated, would\ndestroy it, for all theories and conceptual frameworks face\npotentially falsifying anomalies at all times (Kuhn [1962] 1970a and\n1970b; Lakatos 1970 agreed). Popper\u2019s \u201ccritical\nrationalism\u201d, the key to Popper\u2019s Enlightenment conception\nof political democracy as well as scientific advance, is actually\nirrational; for such criticism would undercut the\nresearchers\u2019 reason for being.\n\n(5) Kuhn claimed that Popper and others had missed the existence of\nkey structures in the history of science\u2014the longer-term\napproaches that he called paradigms and hence both normal and truly\nrevolutionary science. There are different historical scales in play:\nindividual theories, paradigms, and the still longer-term perspective\nof a succession of paradigms. So Kuhn adopted a two-tiered or\ndouble-process conception of science in which there is, first, a\nconstitutive framework (the paradigm), held immune to revision during\nperiods of normal science, and, second, change from one framework to\nanother. For these frameworks are historically contingent and are\neventually displaced by others. Kuhn\u2019s two-process account\nsharply clashed with the one-process account of Popper (1963) and many\nothers. Ironically, given that Kuhn was also attacking positivist\npositions, and given his greater sympathy for Popper, the two-process\naccount was closer to the \u201cpositivists\u201d Reichenbach and\nCarnap than to Popper (see Reisch 1991; Carnap 1950; De Langhe\n2014a,b; Nickles 2013a).\n\n(6) Thus two different accounts of scientific rationality are\nrequired, not one: one to cover the relatively smooth change within\nnormal science under a single paradigm and the other to handle radical\nparadigm change. This immediately implies that there are two basic\ntypes of scientific change, hence two problems of scientific change\nand/or two problems of progress to be solved, hence two accounts of\nscientific rationality needed to solve them. What were Kuhn\u2019s\nconstructive claims?\n\n(7) We should seek neither a single, neutral method of all science at\nall times nor an account based on explicit methodological rules. Most\nnormal scientific decisions are based on skilled judgments, not rules\n(Kuhn [1962] 1970a: chs. 5, 10). The appearance of rules in scientific\npractice is a sign of crisis, of breakdown. Contrary to tradition,\nneither rationality within a paradigm nor rational choice between\nparadigms is a matter of following rules. It is not the application of\na formal, logic- or probability-based algorithm. In both cases it is a\nmatter of skilled judgment (of different kinds).\n\n(8) Informal scientific judgment depends heavily upon rhetoric and\njudgments of heuristic fertility in the context of discovery\u2014the\nvery items that had been expressly excluded from the context of\nrational justification by the dominant tradition. For Kuhn, normal\nproblem solving is a matter of modeling new puzzles solutions on\nestablished precedents, the exemplars, where modeling crucially\ninvolves judgments of similarity, analogy, or metaphor. (Whereas\nPopper\u2019s methodology is a learning theory in which we learn only\nfrom our mistakes, in Kuhn\u2019s we learn also (mainly) from our\nsuccesses\u2014the exemplars, which, over time ratchet up our\nknowledge within normal science.) In paradigm change, the rhetorical\ntropes used in persuasion are typically more abstract and tenuous than\nin normal science. Kuhn\u2019s account of the rational acceptance of\nparadigm change had to remain thin because of incommensurability. Here\nthe justification problem was all the more difficult because new\nparadigms generally lose some of the successes of their predecessors\n(so called \u201cKuhn loss\u201d of problem solutions but also data,\ntheory, goals, and standards).\n\n(9) Kuhn\u2019s novel constructive move in dealing with the\nrationality of paradigm change was to bring in a prospective dimension\nof heuristic fertility judgments. From the point of view of key,\ncreative scientists, the old paradigm has exhausted its resources,\nwhereas radical new ideas and practices can not only resolve some old\nanomalies (retrospective confirmation) but, equally importantly, can\nreinvent and thereby preserve the field by opening up new frontiers\nwith much interesting new work to be done. For them the field now had\na future. To be sure, heuristic guidance was also a feature of normal\nscience, but there it was built in implicitly.\n\nIn sum, Kuhn turned the traditional ideas of scientific justification,\nbased on the discovery-justification-context distinction, on their\nhead. Ironically, once we take the research scientists\u2019 points\nof view, the more interesting forms of scientific cognition, including\njustification, occur in contexts of discovery. All of this according to Kuhn.\n\nCritics countered that, while the historicist upstarts had scored some\ndamaging critical points, their positive accounts of scientific\nrationality were underdeveloped, vague, and unconvincing. Political\nrevolution and religious conversion as models of rational\nbehavior?! Clark Glymour (1980: 7, 96ff) called the new approach\n\u201cthe new fuzziness\u201d. Could intuitive judgment really\nreplace standard confirmation theory? And what would be the analogous\nrelation of evidence to theory at the metamethodological level, where\nnow \u201ctheory\u201d was the set of methodological rules or theory\nof rationality itself? (Historicists replied that it is not their fault\nif real-life decision-making is a messy business that often outruns\navailable formal rules.) Shapere (1984: chs. 3\u20135) was a severe\nearly critic of Kuhn, and Lakatos (1970: 178) reported that Kuhn had\nreplaced rationality with \u201cmob rule\u201d. Since Shapere and\nLakatos were historicists, we see that the historicists could disagree\nsharply among themselves. Feyerabend will provide the most vivid\nexample.\n\nKuhn\u2019s insightful treatment of science from the working\nscientists\u2019 point of view provided a microlevel conception of\nrational decision-making. But did he have a metamethodological account\nof how to decide among competing theories of scientific rationality?\nAgain, not an explicit and comprehensive account, only some\nconstructive suggestions. Like all historicists, he said that a\nrationality theory must fit the history of science and that the\ntraditional accounts failed this history test. An adequate theory must\nalso be progressive and avoid epistemological relativism. Kuhn (and\nmany others) simply built in these norms from the outset. Such a move\nworks well among most friends of historicism but not well for critics,\nwho think these presuppositions simply beg the normativity of history\nquestion. Given incommensurability, are not rationality,\nprogressiveness, and denial of relativism key items that must be\nargued for? In other passages, Kuhn did argue for them, but few\ncritics were convinced.\n\nOn the positive side, Kuhn made an epistemological economy claim. \n\n\n[I]n its normal state \u2026 a scientific community is an immensely\nefficient instrument for solving the problems or puzzles that its\nparadigms define. ([1962] 1970a: 166; cf. Wray 2011: ch. 7) \n\n\nIt is clear that Kuhn considered science more\nefficient on his own account than on Popper\u2019s, because the double process enables\nextreme specialization (Wray 2011; De Langhe 2014c). Indeed,\ntraditional accounts fail Kuhn\u2019s demarcation\ncriterion\u2014that a genuine science supports a puzzle-solving\ntradition. Given Kuhn\u2019s conviction that science is progressive\nin terms of problem-solving success, predictive accuracy, simplicity\n(the reworking and streamlining of problem-solving efficiency over\ntime), and so on, it supposedly follows that his account makes science\nboth rational and non-relativistic. Critics disagreed.\n\nThere also seems to be a kind of transcendental argument strategy\nbehind Kuhn\u2019s approach, as a response to the quasi-Kantian\nquestion: Given that science, as historically practiced, is\nlargely rational and progressive, but not in the standard way, how are\nits rationality and progress possible? Supposedly, the study of the\nhistorical patterns will show the way.\n\nKuhn often described his two-process view as \u201cKant with moveable\ncategories\u201d. Accordingly, there is also a dialectical,\nquasi-Hegelian reading: from the myriad of micro-decisions by the\ncommunity of scientists in a given field over time, with lots of fits\nand starts, a progressive enterprise emerges, although not one that is\nteleologically converging on the metaphysical truth about the universe\nor on any other \u201cend\u201d. However, on this view we have\nabandoned the idea that individual scientific decisions are typically\ndriven by an explicit concern for rationality. In several areas of\nphilosophy there are heated controversies about whether higher-order\nemergents have genuine causal power and hence genuine explanatory\nforce. To that degree, it remains unclear what role the desire to be\nrational plays, as opposed to more mundane motives. This problem\narises for other historicists as well, as David Hull will note. (See\nthe entries on\n mental causation\n and on\n internalist vs. externalist conceptions of epistemic justification.)\n\nOn rationality as socially emergent, we may jump ahead here to note that feminist\nphilosophers of science such as Helen Longino and Miriam Solomon have\ndefended scientific rationality as a socially emergent norm (Longino\n1990, 2001; Solomon\n2001). They thereby address the question of how a naturalistic,\nscience-as-practiced approach to scientific knowledge can nonetheless\nhave normative implications. However, they do not shy away from making\npolicy proposals for changing (improving) scientific\npractices and their supporting institutions. On their accounts, some\nother factors, such as political/ideological ones, also socially\nemerge and can have top-down causal efficacy on individual\npractitioners but without negating the agency and autonomy of those\nindividuals. Here familiar issues of \u201cmethodological\nindividualism\u201d come into play. (See the entries on\n feminist epistemology and philosophy of science,\n feminist perspectives on science,\n feminist social epistemology,\n and\n feminist political philosophy.)\n\nThe vigorous attacks on Kuhn as a radical subjectivist and\nirrationalist who was undermining not only philosophy but the Western\nintellectual tradition now look exaggerated, but it is fair to say\nthat the five big problem-complexes of normativity, incommensurability\n(including meaning change), relativism, social knowledge, and deep but\nrational progressive change are extremely difficult and remain open to\ndebate today. For many philosophers of science, relativism is the big\nbugaboo that must be defeated at all costs. For them, any view that\nleads to even a moderate relativism is thereby reduced to absurdity.\nHistoricist philosophers have insisted on relativity to historical\ncontext but, with few exceptions, have made a sharp distinction\nbetween relativity and outright relativism. Some\ncritics have not found this distinction convincing (see the entry on\n relativism,\n Kindi & Arabatzis 2012 and Richards & Daston 2016).\n1.3 The Methodology of Scientific Research Programs\n\nCriticism and the Growth of Knowledge (1970), edited by\nLakatos and Alan Musgrave, was a second major contribution to the\nhistoricism debate. This collection of articles, originating from a\n1965 London conference, was in significant respects a reaction to\nKuhn; but it is especially important for Lakatos\u2019s own\ncontribution to the volume, \u201cFalsification and the Methodology\nof Scientific Research Programmes\u201d (MSRP), an attempt to\naccommodate a broadly Popperian perspective to some of Kuhn\u2019s\nideas and thereby to diverge from Popperian orthodoxy. Lakatos had\nlong favored an historical approach to the philosophy of mathematics\nand science (see his 1976). One of his central concerns was to defend\nthe rational continuity and progressiveness of modern science from the\nchallenge of radical change. Another was to fend off charges of\nhistorical relativism.\n\nLike Kuhn\u2019s paradigms and Laudan\u2019s research traditions\n(see below), the unit of rational appraisal for Lakatos is not a\nsingle theory at a point in time; instead, it is a series of theories\nthat are rationally-connected moments in the development of an\nidentifiable research program. In MSRP these theories share a\nnegative heuristic containing inviolable principles and a\npositive heuristic that both provides a \u201cprotective\nbelt\u201d around the negative heuristic and guides future research.\nThe forward-looking heuristic element was, as for Kuhn, an important\nfeature missing from traditional accounts of science. In MSRP,\nresearch programs are evaluated as to their progressiveness\nover historical time, i.e., which grows knowledge fastest.\nLakatos\u2019s measure of knowledge growth is novel prediction, the\nadvantage going to which program yields more novel\ntheoretical predictions and more confirmed novel\npredictions than its competitors. This is a historicist position since\ndetermining whether something is a novel prediction requires detailed\nknowledge of the historical context of discovery in which the\npredictive theory was produced (Lakatos & Zahar 1976).\nUnfortunately, however, Lakatos\u2019s falsificationism had become so\nsophisticated that he could provide no rule for when it was rational\nto abandon a degenerating research program that was being outstripped\nby a more progressive one; for scientists, he said, may legitimately\nmake risky choices. In any case, contrary to Kuhn, two or more\nresearch programs may exist side-by-side. Lakatosian rationality does\nnot dictate that researchers all join the same program.\n\nWhat is the relation between a theory of scientific rationality and a\ngeneral methodology of science? Like the Popperians from which he\ndiverged, Lakatos held that methodologies are theories of\nscientific rationality (Curtis 1986). Similarly, a metamethodology\n(tasked with determining which methodology outperforms others) is\nidentical with a metatheory of scientific rationality. Lakatos\u2019s\nmetatheory recapitulates MSRP at the metalevel. According to Lakatos,\nhis meta-MSRP shows that MSRP defeats competing methodologies, because\nit provides the best fit with the history of science in the sense that\nit renders the history of science maximally rational. That is, MSRP\nmakes rational sense of both the intuitively rational episodes and\nsome that its competitors have to exclude as externally caused\ndeviations from the rational ideal. Indeed, it predicts that\nsome counterintuitive cases will be seen to be rational when examined\nclosely.\n\nLakatos\u2019s paper, \u201cThe History of Science and Its Rational\nReconstructions\u201d (1971: 91) opens with a promising paraphrase of\nKant (previously used by Hanson (1962: 575, 580) and by Herbert Feigl\n(1970: 4): \u201cPhilosophy of science without history of science is\nempty; history of science without philosophy of science is\nblind\u201d. However, his use of rational reconstructions of\nsupporting historical episodes\u2014the science as it allegedly could\nhave been done or should have been done\u2014made the actual\nscience look more internally correct (according to MSRP) than it was.\nHistorians and philosophical critics replied sharply that this was not\ngenuine history and hence not a fair test (see Arabatzis forthcoming).\n\nLakatos and his followers (e.g., Worrall 1988, 1989) conceived MSRP as\na fixed and final methodology by contrast with Kuhn\u2019s,\nToulmin\u2019s, and (eventually) Laudan\u2019s changing\nmethodologies. The idea that all previous history of science was\nworking up to this final methodology that Lakatos was first to\ndivine\u2014the end-of-history for methodology, so to speak\u2014was\none of the broadly Hegelian themes in Lakatos\u2019s work. Another\nwas that there is no instant rationality as proposed by the formal\napproaches of standard confirmation theory. Writes Daniel Little (in\nthe entry on\n philosophy of history)\n \u201cHegel finds reason in history; but it is a latent reason, and\none that can only be comprehended when the fullness of history\u2019s\nwork is finished\u2026 \u201d. The owl of Minerva flies out at\ndusk. For Lakatos rational judgments can only be made retrospectively.\nFor example, one cannot judge an experiment as crucial at the time it\noccurs, only in historical retrospect (1970: 154ff). Appraisals are\nmade with hindsight. (See the entry on\n Lakatos.)\n1.4 Methodological Anarchism\n\nIn his early work Feyerabend (1962) appealed to historical cases to\nreject Hempel\u2019s account of explanation and Nagel\u2019s\nparallel account of intertheoretic reduction (traditionally postulated\nmechanisms of cumulative progress), on the ground that in actual\nhistorical practice meaning change occurs from one major theory to its\nsuccessor. Deducibility thus fails. It also more obviously fails because\nthe two theories are typically mutually inconsistent. Accordingly, one\ncannot reason by traditional logical argument from one to the other.\nFeyerabend introduced his own conception of incommensurability into\nthis work. Anticipating his later broad pluralism, early Feyerabend\nalso extended the Popperian line on testing to a full-blown\nproliferationist methodology. Competing theories should be multiplied\nand tested against each other, because more empirical content is\nthereby brought to light than in testing theories in isolation. In his\nlater work, Feyerabend (1975, 1987, 1989) moved vehemently away from\nthe positions of the Popper school. He vigorously rejected the idea of\na scientific method that makes science superior to other cultural\nenterprises. According to his \u201cmethodological anarchism\u201d,\nany so-called methodological rule, including logical consistency,\ncould be fruitfully violated in some contexts. That said, his\nwell-known slogan, \u201cAnything goes\u201d, was widely read as\nmore radical than he intended, given his playful interactions with his\nfriend Lakatos.\n\nThis later Feyerabend declared that his primary aim was humanitarian,\nnot epistemological, so it was not his purpose to defend the rationality\nof science. His attack on dogmatic, scientistic conservatism, both\nwithin and without scientific communities, has methodological import,\nalbeit negative import. Feyerabend was one of the first to stress the\nstrong historical contingency of scientific work, in context of\njustification as well as discovery, and he defended this contingency\nat the methodological level as well. Thus there is no fixed\nrationality of science. For example, Galileo (he argued in historical\ndetail) introduced a new sort of methodology, a new kind of\nrationality, partly via rhetorical deception, partly with arresting\napplications of mathematics to basic mechanical phenomena.\nGalileo\u2019s new vision happened to win out, but there is no point\nin calling it either rational or irrational in any absolute sense.\n\nPhilosophers, retreating from concrete detail to their abstract\nformalisms, make science look far more rational than it is, stressed\nFeyerabend. \u201c[H]istory, not argument, undermined the\ngods\u201d, and also undermined Aristotelian science and several\nlater scientific orthodoxies (1989: 397, his emphasis). Feyerabend\nrejected \u201cthe separability thesis\u201d, according to which a\nhighly contingent historical processes can furnish scientific products\nthat are true and non-contingent, products that have achieved escape\nvelocity from history as it were (my expression). However, although\nnot as pronounced as in Lakatos, there remain traces of historicist\nconsequentialism in Feyerabend\u2019s view, as when he wrote that\n\u201cscientific achievements can be judged only after the\nevent\u201d ([1975] 1993: 2). There is no \u201ctheory\u201d of\nscientific rationality in Feyerabend, only a historicist anti-theory,\nas it were; but he was not quite the irrationalist that critics took\nhim to be. (See the entry on\n Feyerabend.\n For recent work on historical contingency, see Stanford 2006 and\nSoler et al. 2015.)\n\nFeyerabend embraced the relativism implied by the positions just\ndescribed. In a late work, Science as Art, influenced by the\nprominent Viennese art historian Alois Riegl, he spoke of distinct,\nself-contained scientific styles at different periods that are much\nlike the distinct styles in art (Ginzburg 1998). Such a view fit well\nwith his sometime assertion that there is no scientific progress, just\na succession or multiplicity of styles. Here there is a faint\nconnection to Kuhn\u2019s early views, although the two men\nreportedly did not interact as much as one might expect while both\nwere at Berkeley.\n1.5 The Pragmatic, Problem-Solving Approach\n\nLaudan opened Progress and Its Problems (1977) with the claim\nthat providing an adequate model of rationality is the primary\nbusiness of the philosopher of science but that no extant\nmethodologies fit actual science. In this book his idea of good fit\nwas fit with a selection of intuitively strong historical instances\nthat any adequate theory must explain. (Laudan 1984 and 1996: ch. 7,\nlater rejected the intuitionistic elements that gave normative punch\nto this model.) His response to the rationality question was to\npropose a thoroughgoing, explicitly pragmatic, problem-solving account\nof science. Problem-solving had been an important element in previous\naccounts, notably those of Kuhn and Popper, but Laudan\nreversed the usual account of scientific progress as a\ntemporal succession of atemporal rational decisions.  Instead of\ndefining progress in terms of rationality, we should define\nrationality in terms of progress. We cannot measure progress in terms\nof approach to an unknowable, final, metaphysical truth, but we do\nhave reliable markers of progress in terms of numbers and relative\nimportance of both empirical and conceptual problems solved by\nlong-term \u201cresearch traditions\u201d. Just as Lakatos\u2019s\nresearch programs were a compromise between Popper and Kuhn, we can\nread Laudan\u2019s \u201cresearch traditions\u201d as incorporating\nelements of his major historicist predecessors, while departing\nsharply from other tenets of their work.\n\nMany analysts have played with possible relationships between the\nsciences\u2019 assumed rationality and assumed progressiveness. The\ncentral issue for them is analogous to the question in Rodgers and\nHammerstein\u2019s Cinderella: Is science progressive\nbecause it\u2019s rational, or is it rational because it\u2019s\nprogressive? (Kuhn [1962] 1970a: 162, had asked: Does a field make\nprogress because it is a science, or is it a science because it makes\nprogress?\u201d) The underlying question is whether rationality is\nbasic and fundamental rather than derivative to something else. Those\nlike Laudan who make it derivative need to defend their position\nagainst the objection that they are committing a verificationist\nfallacy of confusing rationality itself (its constitutive nature) with\nthe criteria for applying the term \u2018rational\u2019. Are\nmomentary success or longer-term progress constitutive of\nrationality or merely consequential indicators of it (or neither)?\n\nBe that as it may, since progress is a historical (history-laden)\nconcept, so is rationality on Laudan\u2019s conception, as it was on\nLakatos\u2019s. The temporality of his account led Laudan to\nintroduce an important distinction between acceptance of a\ntheory and pursuit that would explain how rational\ntransitions to a new research tradition are possible. Scientists\nshould accept the theory that, pro tem, has the greatest\noverall problem-solving success, but pursue the tradition that now\nenjoys a higher rate of success. Nearly everyone today\naccepts a distinction of this sort, although not necessarily\nLaudan\u2019s criteria of success.\n\nLike Structure and MSRP, Laudan\u2019s model of science\nreceived much discussion, both constructive and critical. It faced the\nusual difficulties of how we are to count and weigh the importance of\nproblems in order to have a viable accounting scheme. Historicists can\nreply that it is not their fault if this is a messy task, since that\nis just historical reality, a reality that, if anything, favors expert\njudgment over tidy decision algorithms.\n\nLaudan (1984) agreed with Kuhn that the goals, standards, and methods\nof science change historically as well as the theoretical and\nobservational claims, but his \u201creticulationist model\u201d\nrejected as historically inaccurate Kuhn\u2019s claim that sometimes they all\nchange together to constitute a (Kuhnian) revolution. Dramatic change in one\nplace need not seriously disturb fixity elsewhere and rarely or never does. Hence,\nincommensurability is a pseudo-problem. Moreover, Laudan contended, his\nreticulationist model overcomes the hierarchical problem that has led\nthinkers such as Poincar\u00e9 and Popper to make the goals of\nscience arbitrary (the top of the hierarchy and hence the unjustified\njustifier of what comes below), e.g., mere conventions. These authors have no\nway to rationally appraise the goals themselves, leaving their positions stuck\nwith an account of merely instrumental reason: efficiency relative to\na given, arbitrary goal. By contrast, in Laudan\u2019s model, the\nelements are mutually constraining, mutually adjusting, an idea\nprominent in Dewey\u2019s attack on hierarchy in his 1939. None takes\nabsolute precedence over the others. Thus, some goals are irrational\nbecause present and foreseeable knowledge and methods have no way to\nachieve them or to measure progress toward them. (Laudan thereby\nrejected strong realist goals as irrational.) An advance in substantive\nor methodological expertise can make it rational to embrace new\nstandards and also new goals.\n\nThe debate between Laudan and Worrall over the value of a fixed\nmethodology of science wonderfully exemplifies the persistence of the\nancient problem of change (Laudan 1989; Worrall 1989). How is it\npossible to explain, or even to measure, change except in terms of an\nunderlying fixity? Doesn\u2019t allowing change at all three of\nLaudan\u2019s levels\u2014matters of scientific fact and theory,\nmethod and standards, and goals\u2014leave us with a damaging\nrelativism? Worrall defends the fixity of Lakatos\u2019s MSRP but\nagrees that it cannot be established a priori. Laudan\u2019s\nreticulated model retains a more piecemeal and historically contingent fixity, as described\nabove.\n With all that said, the threat of relativism remains, for how can\na good, non-whiggish historicist have a trans-historical measure of\nprogress? Laudan\u2019s answer was that we can whiggishly measure\nscientific progress by our own standards, regardless of what the goals\nof the historical investigators were. This sounds right about what we\ndo. But if the reasons why the historical scientists in the trenches\nmade the decisions they did do not really matter to us (or to any\ngiven generation), retrospectively, then how is rationality providing\na methodological guide or causal explanation why historical scientists\nmade the decisions they did?  Their individual rationality would seem\nto become irrelevant. And why, then, is rationality the central\nproblem of philosophy of science?\n\nDeparting sharply from traditional, non-naturalistic treatments of\nnorms, Laudan addressed the is-ought problem head-on by advancing an\nimportant and influential, pragmatic \u201cnormative\nnaturalism\u201d whereby the acceptable norms are those best\nsupported by successful historical practice\u2014where, again,\nsuccess is as we judge it today. On this view, norms have empirical\ncontent. They are winnowed from the history of successful practice,\nagain a broadly Deweyan idea (e.g., Dewey 1929). At Virginia Tech\nLaudan and colleagues initiated a program to test the individual norms\npresent in various philosophical models of science against the history\nof science (Laudan 1977: 7; Donovan et al. 1988). Like every major\nphilosophical proposal, this one came under critical fire, in this\ncase, e.g., for isolating individual methodological rules from their\nhistorical contexts and for reverting to a traditional, positivistic,\nhypothetico-deductive model of testing. In short, critics complained\nthat Laudan\u2019s metatheory of rationality did not match his\nfirst-order, problem-solving-progress theory of rationality. And\nprofessional historians did not welcome this invitation to\ncooperation, since the project implied a division of labor that\nregarded philosophers as the theoreticians proposing rules to test,\nwhile the historians were relegated to fact-grubbing handmaidens doing\nthe testing. To be fair, as a historicist philosopher, Laudan himself\nhad done a good deal of historical work.\n\nOn another front, Laudan\u2019s (1981) attempt to\n\u201cconfute\u201d scientific realism on the basis of historical\nexamples of major scientific change stimulated much discussion, since\nthe status of realism had become a central issue in philosophy of\nscience. Indeed, Laudan\u2019s article helped to make it so.\n1.6 Evolutionary Models of Scientific Development\n\nToulmin (1972) produced an evolutionary model of scientific\ndevelopment in terms of populations of concepts, a gradualist account\nof scientific change that he considered more historically accurate and\nphilosophically defensible than Kuhn\u2019s discontinuous model.\nToulmin\u2019s \u201cconcepts\u201d are historically malleable, yet they are\ncharacterized by historicity. He quotes Kierkegaard: \u201cConcepts,\nlike individuals, have their histories, and are just as incapable of\nwithstanding the ravages of time as are individuals\u201d (1972:\nfrontispiece). Toulmin held that biological, social, and conceptual\nevolution, including scientific development, are all instances of the\nsame generalized variation-selection-transmission schema, albeit with\nquite different concrete implementations. For Toulmin, disciplines\n(specialties) are analogous to biological species. He touted his model\nas naturalistic, indeed ecological, but not in a way that excludes\nrationality. Rationality enters primarily at the selection level,\ndetermining which families of concepts (including methodological ones)\nget selected and reproduced. Rationality is not a matter of\n\u201clogicality\u201d, i.e., of sticking to a given logical or\nKuhnian framework through thick and thin. Rather, it is a matter of\nadapting appropriately to changing circumstances. Like Newtonian\nforce, rationality has to do with change, not maintenance of the same\nstate. Thus no Kuhnian revolution is needed in order to break out of\nan old conceptual framework.\n\nAs for the descriptive-normative problem, thinkers from Kuhn to Robert\nBrandom (e.g., 2002: 13, 230ff) have appealed to the common law\ntradition as an instructive analogy, and Toulmin was no exception.\nPublished legal cases provide legal precedents that later legal\nargumentation can cite for support. Over time, normative traditions\nemerge. Explicit rules may be formulated by reflecting on the history\nof precedents, but the practices typically remain implicit. There is a\nwhiff of Hegelian, retrospective reconstruction in this idea of\nextracting norms from patterned historical practices that embody them\nimplicitly and contingently. The main trouble with Toulmin\u2019s\naccount, said critics, is that it is so vague and abstract that it\ntells us little about how science works. It would seem to apply to\njust about everything.\n\nDonald Campbell (1960, 1974) had previously defended the generalized\nvariation plus selective retention schema, which he traced back to\nWilliam James. Popper regarded his own evolutionary account of\nscientific development as similar to Campbell\u2019s (1974). Ditto\nfor David Hull (1988) with his more detailed evolutionary model.\nHowever, Hull rejected evolutionary epistemology, as such,\nand denied that he was doing epistemology at all. (Evolutionary\nepistemologies face the problem of why we should expect a contingent\nselectionist process to be truth-conducive: see the entry on\n evolutionary epistemology.\n Assuming that it is can also tempt one to fall into whiggism\nregarding the past in a social Darwinist sort of way.) Hull rejected\nToulmin\u2019s biological species analogy, as based only on\nfeature-similarity rather than on the historical-causal continuity of\ngenuine biological species. Hull\u2019s book reflected his own deep\ninvolvement in the controversy between cladists, evolutionary\nsystematicists, and pheneticists over biological classification. (He\nserved terms as president of both the Society for Systematic Biology\nand the Philosophy of Science Association.) Hull generalized his\nimportant biological concepts of replicator (gene) and interactor\n(organism) to scientists and communities. His central unit of and for\nanalysis was the deme, or research group, in its competition with\nothers.\n\nHull (1988) argued that the success of science can be explained by an\ninvisible hand mechanism rather than in terms of rational\ndecision-making. He did not deny that most scientists regard\nthemselves as rational truth seekers, but on his account the primary\nmotivation is the drive for professional recognition and credit via\npositive citation by others, and avoidance of violations of\ninstitutionalized standards. The term \u2018rationality\u2019 does\nnot even appear in the book\u2019s index. Nonetheless, the\ninstitutional incentive structure of science works to produce\ngenerally reliable results and scientific progress, so that, to\nrationality-minded philosophers, science looks as if it is\ndriven by the intentional rationality of its practitioners. We might\nsay that, for Hull, rationality explains nothing without causal\nbacking, but once we bring the causal mechanisms into play, there is\nno longer a need to foreground rationality, at least not intentional\nrationality.\n\n\nThe better [scientists] are at evaluating the work of others when it\nis relevant to their own research, the more successful they will be.\nThe mechanism that has evolved in science that is responsible for its\nunbelievable success may not be all that \u201crational\u201d, but\nit is effective, and it has the same effect that advocates of science\nas a totally rational enterprise prefer. (1988: 4)\n\n\nLike Adam Smith\u2019s view of the invisible hand regarding altruism\nand the public good, rationalists can interpret Hull\u2019s account\nas broadly Hegelian in the sense that the rationality of science\nemerges (insofar as it does) from the complex social interactions of scientists\nand groups of scientists going about their normal business in ordinary\nways that satisfy community norms and incentive structures, not from\ntheir explicit intentions to make rational decisions. While Hull gave\nclose attention to these social interactions and to the institutions\nthat enable them, he claimed that his appeal to social factors was\ninternal to science rather than external.\n1.7 New-Wave Sociology of Science and the Realist Reaction\n\nLeft relatively untouched by historicist philosophers during the\nBattle of the Big Systems was the internal/external distinction. The\nphilosophers, consonant with traditional sociology of science (e.g.,\nMerton 1973) and sociology of knowledge more generally, defended a\nkind of \u201cinertial principle\u201d (Fuller 1989: xiii et\npassim): social and psychological factors such as economic and\npolitical interests and psychological dispositions should be brought\ninto play only to explain deviation from the rational path. This\ndistinction began to erode already in Kuhn, who stressed the social\nfactors internal to the organization of science itself:\nscience education, the strong role of scientific communities with\ntheir distinctive cultures, etc. (See also Lakatos on comprehensive\ntheories of rationality that can turn apparent external considerations\ninto internal ones, and Hull 1988 on career advancement.)\n\nIn the 1970s, new-wave sociologists of science quickly rejected the\ndivision of labor implied by the inertial principle and took sociology\nfar beyond where Kuhn had left it (much to his chagrin). These\nsociologists insisted that sociology, via social interests and other\nsocial motivational causes, had much to say about the internal,\ntechnical content of science\u2014so much, in fact, that it was not\nclear that there was any room left for the rational explanations of\nthe philosophers. The Edinburgh Strong Programme founded by David\nBloor and Barry Barnes (see Bloor 1976), the Bath relativist school of\nHarry Collins and Trevor Pinch (Collins 1981), and later\nconstructivist work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1979), Karin\nKnorr-Cetina (1981), Steve Shapin (1982), Shapin and Simon Schaffer\n(1985), and Andy Pickering (1984) were important early developments.\n(See Shapin 1982 for a helpful discussion.)\n\nSince the new sociology of science was also heavily based on\nhistorical case studies, we find more radical historicisms challenging\nless radical ones. Although the sociologists often disagreed among\nthemselves, as the philosophers did, the general thrust of their work\nwas that the philosophical historicists had failed to take\nsocio-political context into account and thus were still too much\nwedded to the old, abstract, acausal ideals of rationality,\nobjectivity, and progress toward truth. Much sociological work was\nexplicitly anti-realist and relativist, at least as a methodology.\n\nMost philosophers of science strongly rejected the new sociology as\nrelativist and irrationalist, the non-historicists among them adopting\nversions of strong realism, according to which mature science can\nknowingly, on internalist grounds, arrive at theoretical truth and\ngenuine reference to theoretical entities, or closely enough. The\neventual upshot was \u201cthe Science Wars\u201d of the 1990s. By\nnow (2017), the sides in this dispute have mellowed, fruitful\nconversations are taking place, and some degree of reconciliation has\noccurred (see Labinger & Collins 2001). Work by feminists in\nscience studies such as Donna Haraway (2004) and feminist philosophers\nof science such as Helen Longino (1990, 2001) and Miriam Solomon\n(2001) have rejected assumptions common to both sides in the debate,\nthereby opening the way to their more pluralistic, interactive, and\nless hierarchical options. Distinct prominent approaches to social\nepistemology by philosophers include Fuller 1988, Goldman 1999, and\nRouse 2002. (See the entries on\n social epistemology,\n scientific method,\n scientific realism,\n and the\n social dimensions of science\n as well as the feminist entries referenced above.)\n\nSome of the sociological work had a postmodern cast, and so did\ncontributions by some philosophers. For example, Richard Rorty\u2019s\nversion of historicist pragmatism rejected correspondence theories of\ntruth and the related idea that we humans have some\nnaturalized-theological obligation faithfully to represent\nmetaphysical nature with our science. He spoke suggestively but\nvaguely of major transformations in the sciences (or anywhere else in\nculture), such as that achieved by Galileo, as the invention of a new\n\u201cvocabulary\u201d that worked well enough for certain purposes\nto catch on, but not as new truths established by logical reasoning. As\nfor rationality itself, it is a matter of maintaining an honest, civil\n\u201cconversation\u201d:\n\n\nOn a pragmatist view, rationality is not the exercise of a faculty\ncalled \u201creason\u201d\u2014a faculty which stands in some\ndeterminate relation to reality. Nor is [it] the use of a method. It\nis simply a matter of being open and curious, and of relying\non persuasion rather than force. (1991: 62).\n\n\nSo rationality is not the key to scientific success, and it has as\nmuch to do with rhetoric as with logic. Pragmatists, he said, prefer\nto speak of the success or failure of problem-solving efforts, rather\nthan rationality or irrationality (1991: 66).\n\nA view sometimes ascribed to Rorty\u2019s hero Dewey is that\nrationality is not an a priori, universal method of thinking\nand acting properly; rather, it is like a box of intellectual tools,\neach of which, as humans have learned from craft experience, work better than\nothers in various situations, the result being what might be called a\n\u201cteleonormative\u201d conception of rationality.\n2. Rationality and History: Some Basic Questions\n\nMany of the issues raised by and about historicist conceptions of\nrationality remain unresolved, but the approach has the merit of\nbringing back into discussion several interrelated questions.\n\n What is it to be rational, anyway, once we situate agents in\nreal-life socio-cultural situations?\n Is an account of rationality something discovered rather than\nhumanly constructed?\n Is a theory of rationality something that can be fixed a\npriori, or can it (must it?) be naturalized, in whole or in part,\ni.e., shaped by a broadly empirical mode of inquiry?\n Is there just one, unique, correct conception or theory of\nrationality, of universal applicability?\n Can (should) our concept of rationality be relativized to\nspecifically human capabilities and to specific kinds of\ndecision-action situations, or could it turn out, by some universal\nstandard, perhaps realized by future artificial intelligence or by\n(other) aliens, that we are all terribly non-rational, scientists\nincluded?\n Is scientific rationality special in some way, as distinct from\nrationality in general?\n Is a theory of specifically scientific rationality the same as an\naccount of scientific method? (If so and there is no unique scientific\nmethod, then there is no single, general account of scientific\nrationality either.)\n Is second-order rationality possible, i.e., rational changes in\nscientific goals and standards of rationality themselves?\n Should a metatheory of scientific rationality match the theory of\nfirst-order methodological rules?\n Do we even need a theory of scientific rationality, either to\nexplain research at the microlevel or scientific development at the\nmacrolevel? If so, precisely how does appeal to rationality explain?\nDoes it provide a causal mechanism?\n How is the individual rationality of a researcher related to the\nrationality of the working group and to the community of specialists\nas a whole? In other words, how does (or should) the distribution of\ncognitive labor affect the discussion of rationality?\n Are rationality assessments instantaneous (given the logical or\nmathematical relations of the available information) or do they (at\nleast sometimes) require historical retrospect or prospect?\n What good is the historical study of how basic categories of\ndescription such as \u2018fact\u2019, \u2018experiment\u2019,\n\u2018objective\u2019, \u2018replication\u2019, and \u2018novel\nprediction\u2019 change over time? What does such history tell us, if\nanything, about human inquiry or epistemology?\n What does \u2018historicism\u2019 mean in this context, and\nwhat could a constitutively historicist theory of rationality be?\n\n3. Historicism Then and Now\n\nNineteenth-century philosophers and (especially) historians are\ncommonly credited with the modern \u201cdiscovery\u201d of history,\nespecially political history, via developing the discipline of\nevidence-based, interpretive and explanatory historiography. Hegel\nhistoricized Kant at the beginning of that century, but it was\nprimarily German historians such as Ranke, Droysen, Windelband,\nDilthey, Rickert, and Weber who developed competing conceptions of\nwhat is required for rigorous historical research. (For an in-depth\nsurvey, see Beiser 2011.) These historians were concerned to develop\nhistoriography as wissenschaftlich but autonomous from the\nnatural sciences, where positivism reigned. They also rejected the\ngrand, Hegel-type philosophies of history. Toward the end of the\ncentury, this opposition produced the Methodenstreit, the\nvehement debate over differences between the natural sciences\n(Naturwissenschaften) and the socio-historical sciences\n(Geisteswissenschaften). Historicists saw naturalism and\nmaterialistic mechanism as threats.\n\nThe connection of the historicization of philosophy of science in the\n1960s to the German historicist tradition is indirect, given the\ntime-gap of decades. However, the historicists of scientific\nrationality discussed in this article did (or do) agree to several of\nthe following (overlapping) tenets, most of them traceable to\nnineteenth-century antecedents. There exist tensions among the\nfollowing claims, so internal disagreement among historicists is to be\nexpected.\n\n1. The historicity of all things. Virtually all things come\ninto existence and pass away in historical time. Nothing is guaranteed\nto be fixed and permanent, written in the stone of the universe.\n\n2. History vs. a priori reason or logic alone. Human beings\ndo not possess a faculty of a priori reason capable of\nsurveying the space of all logical possibilities. The emergence of\nnon-Euclidean geometry illustrates this point. Human inconceivability\nis not an adequate criterion of either logical or historical\npossibility.\n\n3. Our historical boundedness: anti-whiggism and the principle of\nno privilege. We inquirers are also historically situated. While\nwe are not slaves to our cultural context, we can escape it only\npartially and with difficulty. Our horizons sometimes prevent us from\nrecognizing our own presuppositions, not to mention future\npossibilities. Wrote Mary Hesse: \u201cour own scientific theories\nare held to be as much subject to radical change as past theories are\nseen to be\u201d (1976: 264). Although we have good reason to hold\nthat our science is superior to that of the past, this does not confer\nan absolute, ahistorical privilege on our science. Rather than succumb\nto this perspectival illusion, we must imagine that our successors may\nlook at us as we see our predecessors. We, too, are just a\ntransitional stage into a future that is likely to include much that\nis beyond our present horizon of imagination. We must avoid the flat\nfuture illusion that sees the future a tame continuation of the\npresent (Nickles forthcoming).\n\n4. History as endlessly creative, thus an endless frontier.\nStrong historicists think an endless frontier is likely, history as\nopen, and productive of perpetual novelty (no agency intended).\n\n5. Historical content of theory of justification: The complexity\nof history. History is too complex and too subtle to be captured\nby a fixed, formal system or in terms of the dynamical relationships\nof a set of \u201cstate variables\u201d. Logical and probabilistic\nsystems alone are crude tools for capturing the reasoning of real\npeople, scientists included. Besides the subtle, contextual reasons,\ninnovative scientists work at moving research frontiers\n(\u201ccontext of discovery\u201d) and, so, must make many decisions\nunder uncertainty (not only under mere risk). Rationality has more to do with\nappropriate response to change than with sticking rigidly to\none\u2019s initial standpoint. This challenge strikes at the heart of\ntraditional accounts of context of justification, hence at the heart\nof traditional philosophy of science. Thinkers from Kuhn to van\nFraassen (2002: 125) have taken a dim view of confirmation theory,\nalthough Bayesians have made valiant attempts to capture historicist\ninsights. (For examples, see Salmon 1990 and Howson & Urbach\n1993).\n\n6. Consequentialism and history as a judge. Frontier\nepistemology teaches that we can often only learn which modes of\naction are successful via historical experience of the consequences.\n(Non-historicists can reply that the eventual judgment is not itself\nhistorical but only delayed, because based on evidence gathered over\ntime.) In its strongest form, historical judgment replaces \u201cthe\nLast Judgment\u201d, the judgment of God, as reflected in the common\nexpression \u201cthe judgment of history\u201d. (Of course, this\nview is itself anti-historicist in its conception of finality.)\n\n7. Genetic, genealogical understanding. Since nearly\neverything is the product of historical development or disintegration,\nstudying its historical genesis and dissolution is key to\nunderstanding it. Genetic fallacies are avoidable by including\ndevelopment and maintenance as part of the narrative, since\ndevelopment can be transformative. Today many writers are exploring\nthe biological and socio-cultural evolutionary origins of human\nrationality, going far deeper, historically, than to recent historical\ndevelopments such as the so-called Scientific Revolution.\n\n8. Historical skepticism, incommensurability, and relativism.\nOne role of historiography is to debunk myths. As such, it can be\nliberating, as when we see that institutions and conceptual frameworks\nare, to a large degree, human constructions with a historical origin,\nnot things irremediably fixed in the foundation of the universe. For that\nvery reason it produces a degree of skepticism toward all human\nthings. Although the natural world shapes human cultures, including\nscientific ones, it far from dictates a single, fixed culture.\nHistoriography discloses that human enterprises, including the\nsciences, are imbedded in deep cultures with their distinctive norms.\nThere is no \u201cGod\u2019s-eye\u201d, history-neutral set of\nmeta-norms, no \u201cArchimedean point\u201d from which these\ncultures can be objectively compared. Thus it is difficult or\nimpossible to evaluate all science with a single standard. Here lurks\nthe problems of cultural incommensurability and relativism.\n\n9. Pluralism. Methodological pluralism is a natural\nconsequence of historicist approaches. Historical study discloses that\nthe various sciences employ quite different methods and often harbor\ncompeting research programs. The emergence of philosophy of biology as\na specialty area in the wake of the 1959 Darwin centennial added\nsubstance to this claim. (For entries into the pluralism literature,\nsee Dupr\u00e9 1993; Galison & Stump 1996; Mitchell 2003; and\nKellert et al. 2006.)\n\n10. Science as a model of rationality. On this theme,\nhistoricists are divided. Some strong historicists, especially\nFeyerabend, Hull, and thoroughgoing social constructivists, deny that\nscience is rationally or methodologically special among human\nenterprises.\n\n11. Science as a model of progress. This, too, is practically\naxiomatic among philosophers of science. The idea of history\n\u201citself\u201d as progressive came in with the Enlightenment and\nwas severely challenged by the world wars.\n\n12. Historicism as half-naturalistic. Historicist accounts do\nnot appeal to supernatural factors or to factors beyond the\npossibility of human cognition such as clairvoyance or the\nmetaphysical truth about reality. Historicists usually take a second\nstep toward naturalism in considering humans as biologically limited\nbeings, but they resist reduction to the natural science brand of\nnaturalism. Philosophical historicists also reject the reduction of\nnorms to facts. (But, late in life, R.G. Collingwood may have come to hold a\nstrong version of historicism according to which philosophy reduces to\nhistory: see the entry on\n Collingwood.\n Some new-wave sociologists may have held a parallel reductionist view\nabout philosophy and sociology, insofar as philosophy was worth\nsaving.)\n\n13. Major historical change as emergent\u2014against intelligent\ndesign and the conscious model. Many historical developments are\nnot deliberately chosen or designed but emerge from numbers of people\ncarrying out their individual and collective activities. The rise of the nation-state\nand of the international capitalist economic system were not the\nproducts of centralized, rational planning, nor were modern science\nand technology, although there were, of course, many micro-instances\nof such planning. This point applies to the idea of scientific method,\nwhich tradition often depicted as clairvoyantly, intelligently guiding\nscientific innovation. But as Hume already anticipated, no method is\nguaranteed in advance to work in a novel domain. Methodological\ninnovation typically follows rather than precedes innovative work\n(Hull 1988; Dennett 1995; Nickles 2009, forthcoming). This is a\nbroadly Hegelian idea.\n\n14. Strong historical determinism is mistaken. A controversy\namong historicists of various stripes is whether there are \u201ciron\nlaws of historical development\u201d. Hegel and Marx, in quite\ndifferent but related ways, believed in a teleological conception of\nhistory, that \u201cit\u201d was working its way inevitably through\nknown stages toward a final goal that would amount to \u201cthe end\nof history\u201d in the sense that deep historical change would now\ncease. This is the view that Popper termed \u201chistoricism\u201d\nin The Poverty of Historicism (1957; see also his 1945).\nPopper vehemently rejected this version of historicism, as do\nvirtually all historicist philosophers of science today. For them,\nhistory is non-teleological and highly contingent. This includes\nKuhn\u2019s ([1962] 1970a) model, although the latter does posit an\nalmost inevitable, unending alternation of normal and revolutionary\nperiods\u2014a final pattern without end, as it were.\n\n15. Hermeneutic interpretation. The received, covering-law\nmodel of explanation is inadequate to explain historical action,\nincluding that of scientists and communities of scientists. Kuhn\ndescribed his method as hermeneutic, but few historicist philosophers\nof science are full-blown hermeneuticists or as fully committed to\nempathic understanding as were some of the classic German\nhistoricists. Most or all historicists are somewhat partial to\nnarrative forms of explanation. (See the entry on\n scientific explanation.)\n4. Related Developments and Further Challenges\n\nThe battle of the big systems seems to be over, and likewise for the\nheyday of interdisciplinary departments and programs of history and\nphilosophy of science (but see below). So are historicist conceptions\nof rationality dead? Despite claims that historicist philosophy of\nscience has been \u201cwithering on the vine\u201d (Fuller 1991), it\nis fair to say that historicist influences remain important, but in a\nsubtler way. Most philosophers of science are more historically\nsensitive than before, whether or not they identify as historicists.\nHistoricist interests have expanded into \u201cthe naturalistic\nturn\u201d, \u201cthe models turn\u201d, and \u201cthe practice\nturn\u201d, which includes interest in contemporary practices, and,\nto a lesser degree, in future history (Nickles forthcoming).\n\nMoreover, in parallel developments, the classical conception of\nrationality is under attack on many fronts. Herbert Simon (1947)\nintroduced the ideas of bounded rationality and satisficing. Simon\nlater championed the need for a heuristic approach to problem solving\nby humans and computers (Newell & Simon 1972). Various flavors of\nartificial intelligence then led the way in the methodology of problem\nsolving, with heuristics as a central topic and no longer the temporary\nscaffolding of positivism and Popper. Simon\u2019s program in\nadaptive, \u201cecological rationality\u201d is now being expanded\nby Gerd Gigerenzer and the Adaptive Behavior and Cognition group in\nBerlin (Gigerenzer et al. 1999). Simon\u2019s approach and the\n\u201cheuristics and biases\u201d program of Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky (Kahneman et al. 1982), plus work by the\nlatter on prospect theory, triggered the emergence of behavioral\neconomics, which rejects the neo-classical homo economicus\nrationality model. Philosopher Christopher Cherniak\u2019s\nMinimal Rationality (1986) also brought out sharply how\nidealized were traditional philosophical assumptions about\nrationality. In other directions, some computer scientists are\nchallenging the anthropocentrism of received conceptions of rational\ninference by asking why artificial intelligence, including deep\nlearning, should be restricted to human forms of reasoning. Meanwhile,\nbiologists and philosophers are studying the evolution of rationality\n(Okasha & Binmore 2012), and ethologists ask why we should\nwithhold attributions of rationality to animals from chimps and\nelephants to octopuses, simply because they seem to lack a human sort\nof conceptual language.\n\nNonetheless, there is wide agreement that historicist accounts of\nscientific rationality cannot fully supplant traditional views. For\nexample, there surely does exist some \u201cinstant\nrationality\u201d even at research frontiers. One finds a wide\nvariety of decision contexts there, and some of these decisions will\nbe uncontroversially warranted at that time and in that context, while\nothers will not be. Hesse (1980) and many others (see Radnitzky &\nAndersson 1978) raised the issue of how to generalize from historical\ncase studies, for citing case studies can be like citing the\nBible. One can cherry-pick one\u2019s case studies to\nsupport most any position. In any case it is fallacious to generalize\nfrom a few, highly contextualized case studies to conclusions about\nall science at all times. Early historical work in social studies of\nscience faced the same problem. Ironically, such generalization\nabstracts away from the historicity of the case studies themselves.\nThe attempt to replace inductive generalization by testing via an H-D\nmodel also runs into trouble, as we noted in connection to the\nVirginia Tech project. And why should case studies from two or three\nhundred years ago be taken seriously when science itself has changed\nsignificantly in the meantime? Partly for this reason Ronald Giere\n(1973) contended that it was necessary to study only today\u2019s\nscientific practices, that philosophers had no special need of\nconsulting historians.\n\nLate in life, Kuhn himself, surprisingly, rejected the case-study method as too\nwedded to the traditional view of science as a direct search for the\ntruth about the universe. The first generations of historical inquiry\nby philosophers and sociologists so shockingly revealed the presence\nof many non-epistemic factors and the general failure of any method\nfully to justify scientific beliefs, he said, that skepticism was the\nresult. The more people learned about how science is actually done,\nthe more skeptical they became. Declared Kuhn, we can more securely\nderive historical patterning \u201cfrom first principles\u201d and\n\u201cwith scarcely a glance at the historical record itself\u201d\n(1991: 111ff). This is not a complete departure from history, however,\nfor it begins from what he termed \u201cthe historical\nperspective\u201d, a non-whiggish understanding of the decisions\nactually available to the historical actors in their own context.\nKuhn\u2019s main point is that such decisions should be considered\ncomparative (\u201cIs this item better than that one, given the\ncontextual knowledge and standards?\u201d), not as judgments of truth\nor probability. This move reduces the problem of understanding\nbehavior in rational terms to something manageable, he explained.\nDeveloping this point, Kuhn said, will bring the only defensible sort\nof rationality back into scientific practice in a way that largely\navoids the old problems of incommensurability. It will also provide a\ndefensible concept of scientific progress and of scientific\nknowledge (almost by definition)\u2014knowledge as what the\nscientific process produces. This historical perspective was part of\nKuhn\u2019s project of developing a biological analogy for the\ndevelopment of science, wherein disciplinary speciation events\ncorrespond to revolutions. Kuhn held that his approach applied to all\nhuman enterprises, not just science (Kuhn 2000).\n\nRecently, Rogier De Langhe (2014a,b,c, 2017) has been developing a\nbroadly Kuhnian, two-process account of science from an economics\nstandpoint. Instead of doing a series of historical cases, De Langhe\nand colleagues are developing algorithms to detect subtle patterns in\nthe large citation databases now available. In sum, both late Kuhn and\nearly De Langhe are now appealing to the history of science in a more\nabstract, or perhaps comprehensive, manner, a manner complementary to the two-process approach of\nMichael Friedman (below).\n\nAnother general challenge for historicists and others concerned with\nthe rationality of science is how to factor the division of labor in\nscience into a model of scientific rationality. How does individual\nrationality (the traditional focus of economists as well as\nphilosophers) relate to the collective rationality of working groups\nor entire specialist communities? (See Sarkar 1983; Kitcher 1993;\nMirowski 1996; Downes 2001; De Langhe 2014b; Latour 1987 and later for his\nactor-network theory; and the entry on\n social epistemology.)\n Feminist philosophers such as Longino (1990, 2001) and Solomon (2001)\nhave proposed more thoroughgoing social epistemologies of science that\ngo beyond the problem of division of labor, which, in their view, is\nstill often treated individualistically.\n5. Integrated HPS and Historical Epistemology: What Good Are They Regarding Scientific Rationality?\n\nThe attempt to integrate historiography and philosophy of science has\na troubled history. Several joint departments and programs were formed\nin the heady 1960s, just as much historiography of science was turning\naway from internalist approaches. As professional historians and\nphilosophers came to realize that their interests differed, many of\nthese programs did wither.\n\nIn the meantime, several philosophers have engaged in serious\ninternalist studies for philosophical purposes, usually focusing on\n\u201cbig names\u201d such as Galileo, Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin,\nand Einstein, or big developments such as the route to the double\nhelix. More recently, scholars such as Nancy Nersessian with her\n\u201ccognitive history\u201d project (1995) have employed new\nresources from the cognitive sciences in this regard, a move neglected\nby Kuhn himself and resisted by sociologists concerned by the\nphilosophers\u2019 neglect of the social basis of the knowledge\nenterprise. (See also Giere 1988; Bechtel & Richardson 1993;\nDarden 2006; Andersen et al. 2006; Thagard, e.g., 2012.) Historians,\nmeanwhile, have focused on social history and, more recently, on\nsocial microhistory and lesser-known figures, including women, rather\nthan on the internalist moves of big-name scientists. Consequently,\nhistoricists today still feel the need to respond to Giere\u2019s\n(1973) question of whether history and philosophy of science can be an\nintimate marriage.\n\nSince 1990 promising new movements have emerged that bring together\nphilosophy of science and historiography of science. First,\nphilosophers of science became interested in the historical emergence\nand professionalization of their own field. Early work quickly\ndestroyed some myths about the Vienna Circle, for example. The primary\norganization here is the International Society for the History of\nPhilosophy of Science (HOPOS), with its own journal and regular\nmeetings. More recently, the Integrated History and Philosophy of\nScience (&HPS) organization has sponsored several conferences with\nthe goal of maintaining the standards of both fields rather than\ncompromising one for the supposed advantage of the other. (For\nbackground, see Schickore 2011, 2017. Consult the &HPS website for\nother contributors.)\n\nTheodore Arabatzis (forthcoming) distinguishes two ways of integrating\nhistory and philosophy of science: the familiar \u201chistorical\nphilosophy of science\u201d (HPS), usually based on\n\u201chistorical\u201d case studies; and the less familiar\n\u201cphilosophical history of science\u201d (PHS). It is well known\nthat historians have found most philosophical work of little use, and\nArabatzis aims to help correct the asymmetric relationship between\nhistory and philosophy.\n\n\n[P]hilosophical reflection on these concepts can be\nhistoriographically fruitful: it can elucidate historiographical\ncategories, justify historiographical choices and, thereby, enrich and\nimprove the stories that historians tell about past science as a\nknowledge-producing enterprise. \n\n\nLabels for movements can be arbitrary and misleading, but several of\nthe authors cited by Arabatzis have been identified with a movement\nusually called \u201chistorical epistemology\u201d, the goal of\nwhich is to combine excellent history of science with philosophical\nsophistication or excellent philosophy with more historical\nsophistication than is usually found in case-studies approaches. Given\nthe epistemological focus, here is where we might expect to find the\ngreater concentration of work relevant to questions of scientific\nrationality. The epicenter of the movement is the Max Planck Institute\nfor the History of Science in Berlin, whose directors over the years,\nLorenz Kr\u00fcger (who died before he could assume the post),\nLorraine Daston, Hans-J\u00f6rg Rheinberger, and J\u00fcrgen Renn,\nhave promoted historical epistemology. A recent, special issue of\nErkenntnis (Sturm & Feest (eds.) 2011) on historical\nepistemology derives from a conference at the Institute. In their\nintroductory essay to the special issue, the co-editors, Uljana Feest\nand Thomas Sturm, ask \u201cWhat (Good) is Historical\nEpistemology?\u201d (Feest & Sturm 2011). The special issue\nincludes a baker\u2019s dozen authors who develop and/or critique\nvarious approaches to historical epistemology. The participants range\nfrom older hands such as Philip Kitcher, Michael Friedman, and Mary\nTiles to more recent contributors such as Jutta Schickore and\nFeest. (See Tiles & Tiles 1993 for an early philosophical\nintroduction to the field.)\n\nFeest & Sturm (2011) divide the movement into three streams. One stream\nstudies historical changes in epistemology-laden concepts\nsuch as objectivity, observation, evidence, experimentation,\nexplanation, and probability. How do new concepts emerge? How are they\nstabilized? At what point do they become conscious rather than\nremaining implicit in practice? How do they shift over time and how\nwell do they travel to different scientific contexts (cf. Howlett\n& Morgan 2011)? Insofar as they are initially metaphorical, how do\nthey become dead metaphors? How do they fade out of use? Lorraine\nDaston\u2019s work is a good example of this approach (e.g., 1988,\n1991; Daston & Galison 2007; Daston & Lunbeck 2011). This\nmeans looking at the evolution of concepts or organizing\n\u201ccategories\u201d of action and thought within a historically\nconfined project, however interdisciplinary it might\nbe\u2014something between the eternal, global, and maximal often\nfavored by philosophers and the evanescent, local, and contingent\nfavored by many historians. Gone is the old-fashioned\n\u201cconceptual history\u201d of the sort exemplified by Max\nJammer\u2019s (1957),\nwhich traces \u201cthe concept\u201d of force from ancient Egypt to\nthe twentieth century. Wrote Daston in an early paper:\n\n\nTo my mind, the most able practitioners of historical epistemology\nthese days are philosophers rather than historians\u2014I think of\nthe remarkable recent work of Ian Hacking and Arnold\nDavidson\u2014although I think they, intellectual historians, and\nhistorians of science might well make common cause in such a venture.\n(1991: 283, footnote omitted; see also Davidson 2002)\n\n\nDaston then asks, \u201cWhat good is historical epistemology?\u201d\nHer opening (but later qualified) suggestion is that it goes part way\ntoward \u201creleasing us from our bondage to the past by hauling\nthat past into conscious view\u201d, although we must recognize that\ncalling attention to the contingent origins of something is not\nsufficient to debunk it, upon pain of committing a genetic fallacy.\nNor can we simply reject something without having an alternative to\nput in its place. \u201cThat is, historicizing is not identical to\nrelativizing, much less to debunking\u201d.\n\nThe second strand of historical epistemology identified by Feest and\nSturm in their introduction to the special issue focuses on the trajectories of the objects of\nresearch\u2014\u201cepistemic things\u201d\u2014rather than on\nconcepts, and here the well-known work of Rheinberger (1997, [2006]\n2010a, [2007] 2010b) is emblematic. Renn (1995, 2004) represents the\nthird approach, an attempt to understand the longer-term dynamics of\nscience. For example, Renn attempts to solve several mysteries about\nhow Einstein was able to accomplish the relativity revolution. His\nanswer takes into account the long history of developments in distinct\nfields that Einstein was able to bring together, partly because of his\nwide philosophical and other cultural interests. Renn looks at\nlong-term developments by analogy with biological development. Norton\nWise (2011) also brings biological metaphor into play. He observes\nthat historical narrative as a form of explanation is now making\nserious incursions into physics, in the physics of complex or highly\nnonlinear systems.  \u201cCovering law\u201d explanations are not\navailable there, he says, and sometimes we must resort to simulations\nin order to understand how systems evolve. \u201cWe know what we can\ngrow\u201d.\n\nRunning through much historical epistemology is a century-long line of\nneo-Kantian thinking, from Ernst Cassirer and the Marburg school to\nReichenbach and Carnap and then to Kuhn, Ian Hacking, Michael\nFriedman, Daston, Renn, and others. Theirs are diverse versions of the\ntwo-process view introduced in\n Section 1.2\nabove. On this view, there are long-term socio-cognitive stabilities\n(not necessarily the paradigms or research programs discussed above)\nthat have a beginning, middle, and end in historical time. They are\nhistoricized Archimedean points or platforms that organize\nhuman experience, rather than fixed Kantian categories. But, like\nKant\u2019s categories, they are presuppositions that define how\ncoherent perception and the formation of true or false propositions\nare possible.\n\nFriedman speaks of these as \u201chistorically contingent but constitutive\na prioris\u201d. His 2011 takes first steps beyond the two-process\ndynamic of his 2001 to address the problem of changing conceptions of\nrationality (i.e., intersubjective objectivity) and to bring in a\nwider social dimension. Like Renn, Friedman makes philosophical\nreflection a key to understanding changes so rapid that they amount to\ndiscontinuities. Up to a point he defends Kuhn on the existence of\nscientific revolutions and incommensurability. Kuhn ran into trouble\nwith incommensurability and relativism, he says, for failing to\ninclude the history of scientific philosophical reflection\nthat parallels the first-order, technical scientific work itself.\nFriedman\u2019s leading example is also the relativity\nrevolution.\n\nWhy do philosophers need to appeal to serious history of science? From\nthe beginning, Friedman has answered this question by insisting on the\nimportance of the history of science to locate the emergence of\nphilosophical ideas in their historical scientific context and vice\nversa\u2014thus to understand the interaction between what\nis commonly called scientific work and philosophical work (Domski\n& Dickson 2010: 4). For example, Newton\u2019s mechanical system\nof the world was shaped by philosophical and theological interests\nthat Newton and his contemporaries considered directly relevant\n(internal not external), as well as socio-political interests. And\nlikewise for Kant and Poincar\u00e9 and Einstein and many other\nthinkers, great and small. To the degree that we retain an\ninternal/external distinction, it is historically relative. Unlike\nmost other historical philosophers, Friedman furnishes the intricate\ntechnical and contextual detail to support such claims.\n\nInspired by Friedman\u2019s approach is the rich collection,\nDiscourse on a New Method: Reinvigorating the Marriage of History\nand Philosophy of Science (2010), edited by Mary Domski and\nMichael Dickson, and containing a book-length response (Friedman\n2010). Their introduction to the volume is a \u201cmanifesto\u201d\nfor \u201csynthetic history\u201d (2010: 11ff, 572ff). This sense of\n\u2018synthetic\u2019 is not opposed to \u2018analytic\u2019, they\ninsist. For example, rather than separating out the mathematical,\nphysical, philosophical, theological and other social-contextual\nconstituents of Newton\u2019s work for separate disciplinary\ntreatment, synthetic history follows Friedman in exploring the ways\nthese relate to one another to achieve an outcome with a satisfying\nconvergence (2010: 15ff). Although inspired by Friedman\u2019s work,\nthe manifesto denies that Friedman\u2019s two-process view is\nessential to synthetic history. (See also the extensive discussion of\nFriedman by Menachem Fisch (forthcoming), a work centered on George\nPeacock\u2019s struggle with rational consistency that helped produce\na transformation in nineteenth-century mathematics.)\n\nA somewhat different sort of two-levels position is the\n\u201chistorical ontology\u201d of Ian Hacking. Hacking (2002, 2012)\ncites Foucault\u2019s \u201cdiscursive formations\u201d\n(epist\u00e8mes) and Alistair Crombie\u2019s \u201cstyles\nof scientific thinking\u201d (Crombie 1994) as inspirations. Examples\nof such styles are the Greek discovery or invention of axiomatic\ngeometry, the laboratory science that emerged in the Scientific\nRevolution (Shapin & Schaffer 1985), and modern probability theory\nand statistical inference (Hacking 1975). Hacking returns to\nKant\u2019s \u201chow possible?\u201d question, the answer to which\nestablishes the necessary conditions for a logical space of reasons in\nwhich practitioners can make true or false claims about objects and\npose research questions about them. And Hacking also historicizes the\nKantian conception.\n\n\nThe historical a priori points at conditions whose dominion\nis as inexorable, there and then, as Kant\u2019s synthetic a\npriori. Yet they are at the same time conditioned and formed in\nhistory, and can be uprooted by later, radical, historical\ntransformations. T.S. Kuhn\u2019s paradigms have some of the\ncharacter of a historical a priori. (Hacking 2002: 5)\n\n\u2026\n\n[S]cientific styles of thinking & doing are not good\nbecause they find out the truth. They have become part of our\nstandards for what it is, to find out the truth. They establish\ncriteria of truthfulness. \u2026 Scientific reason, as manifested in\nCrombie\u2019s six genres of inquiry, has no foundation. The styles\nare how we reason in the sciences. To say that these styles\nof thinking & doing are self-authenticating is to say that they\nare autonomous: they do not answer to some other, higher, or deeper,\nstandard of truth and reason than their own. To repeat: No foundation.\nThe style does not answer to some external canon of truth independent\nof itself. (2012: 605; Hacking\u2019s emphasis)\n\n\nAs in early Kuhn, there is a kind of circularity here that is perhaps not\nvicious but, quite the contrary, bootstraps the whole enterprise.\nHacking describes changes in historical a prioris as\n\u201csignificant singularities during which the coordinates of\n\u2018scientific objectivity\u2019 are rearranged\u201d (2002:\n6).\n\nUnlike Kuhnian paradigms, several of Hacking\u2019s styles of\nthinking and doing can exist side by side, e.g., the laboratory and\nhypothetical modeling traditions. Yet people living before and after\nthe historical crystallization of a style would find each other\nmutually unintelligible. Hacking recognizes that Kuhnian problems of\nrelativism lurk in such positions. \u201cJust as statistical reasons\nhad no force for the Greeks, so one imagines a people for whom none of\nour reasons for belief have force\u201d (2002: 163). This sort of\nincommensurability is closer to Feyerabend\u2019s extreme cases (as\nin the ancient Greek astronomers versus their Homeric predecessors)\nthan to Kuhn\u2019s \u201cno common measure\u201d (2002: chap. 11).\nWrites Hacking,\n\n\nMany of the recent but already \u201cclassical\u201d philosophical\ndiscussions of such topics as incommensurability, indeterminacy of\ntranslation, and conceptual schemes seem to discuss truth where they\nought to be considering truth-or-falsehood. (2002: 160)\n\n\nFor an illuminating exposition and critique of Hacking\u2019s\nposition, see Kusch (2010, 2011).\n A still more integrative role for historical epistemology is\narticulated by Hasok Chang (2004, 2012). Chang is a nonrealist who\nboldly goes beyond the case-study genres of both philosophers and\nprofessional historians to propose what he terms \u201ccomplementary\nscience\u201d, a fully integrated historical and philosophical\napproach that does not stop with pointing out historical contingencies\nbut also investigates them scientifically, e.g., by repeating and\nextending historical experimental practices. Chang\u2019s idea is\nthat complementary science can preserve previously gained knowledge\nand unanswered questions now in danger of becoming lost, and can even\nbuild upon them as a complement to today\u2019s highly specialized\nscientific disciplines. The results can be published as genuine, if\nnon-mainstream, scientific contributions. For example, in his own work\nhe tries to bring the debate over phlogiston to life as well as that\nover the nature of water and the question of its boiling point. For\nhis work, Chang leaves both his armchair and the library, for he needs\nscientific equipment and laboratory space in addition to the usual\nscholarly materials.\n\nHistorical epistemology faces a variety of criticisms, including some\ninherited from the Battle of the Big Systems, e.g., whether\nrationality and objectivity can be locally preserved during major\ntransformations and how to have thoroughgoing historicity, including\nhistorical relativity, without full-blown relativism. Generalization\nproblems still lurk at the meso-scale of historical epistemology. Some\ncritics question whether historical epistemology is anything new,\nsometimes complaining that it just revives traditional history of\nideas. Some would question its neo-Kantian underpinnings. For example,\nhow can we really identify and individuate the\n\u201ccategories\u201d employed by scholars such as Hacking and\nDaston? (See Kusch 2010, 2011 and Sciortino 2017.) Skeptics ask what\ndifference historical epistemology makes to science, history, or\nphilosophy of science. Is it more than a faddish relabeling of work\nalready well underway? Are new historical and/or philosophical methods\nrequired to conduct such a study? Given its different strands, is it\ncoherent as a movement? Various adherents disagree on what it includes\nand even what to call it. Although Daston declares that\nHacking\u2019s work provided much of her original inspiration,\nHacking denies that he is doing historical epistemology, preferring\n\u201cmeta-epistemology\u201d. He also says that he is doing\nwhiggish \u201chistory of the present\u201d. Scholars such as\nNersessian, ABC (Andersen, Barker, & Chen 2006), and Renn rely\nheavily on recent work in cognitive science, whereas sociologists\nstill tend to shun cognitive psychology.\n\nHow significant can we expect historical epistemology to be in the\nlonger run? History will be the judge!\n",
