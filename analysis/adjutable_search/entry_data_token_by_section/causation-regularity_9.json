    "main_text": "Inferential Theories of Causation || The Kairetic Account\n2.4 The Kairetic Account\n\nThe kairetic account by Strevens (2004, 2008) analyses causation in\nterms of causal models. It is driven by the idea that every causal\nclaim is grounded in a causal-explanatory claim. Causation and\nexplanation go hand in hand. Strevens uses the notion of a causal\nmodel to define a relation of entailment with a causal meaning. A set\nof propositions entail an explanandum \\(E\\) in a causal model only if\nthis entailment corresponds to a \u201creal causal process by which\n\\(E\\) is causally produced\u201d (Strevens 2004: 165). Causal models\nare assumed to be founded in physical facts about causal influence,\nand it is assumed that these facts \u201ccan be read off the true\ntheory of everything\u201d (Strevens 2004: 165).\n\nThe kairetic account parallels the DN account of causation in some\nrespects. The logical form of the explanans is basically the same as\nin the DN model. We have laws and propositions about events. A causal\nmodel is here simply a set of causal laws taken together with a set of\npropositions about potential causal factors. Unlike the DN account of\ncausation, the kairetic analysis uses causal notions in the analysans.\nMore specifically, the notion of entailment with a causal meaning is\ntaken as antecedently given. In the previous section, we have\nmentioned Andreas\u2019s (2019) attempt to further specify the\nrelation of logical entailment with a causal meaning using non-modal\nfirst-order logic, belief revision theory, and some further\nnon-logical concepts. This specification may be taken to supplement\nthe kairetic account.\n\nIn Strevens (2004), the kairetic account is essentially motivated by\nthree types of problems. First, causation by conditions that are most\nof the time but not always sufficient to produce a corresponding\neffect. Second, problems of preemption. Third, the problem of how\nfine-grained the description of a cause should be. Consideration of\nthese problems leads to a sophisticated and powerful analysis of\ncausation, which is based on the notion of an explanatory\nkernel for an event. Such a kernel contains laws and propositions\nabout events. Given the veridical causal model \\(M\\), the explanatory\nkernel for an event \\(E\\) is the causal model \\(K\\) such that (i)\n\\(M\\) entails \\(K\\), (ii) \\(K\\) entails \\(E\\), and (iii) \\(K\\)\noptimizes two further properties called generality and\ncohesion. Generality means that \\(K\\) encompasses as many\nphysical systems as can be. Cohesion is a measure for the degree to\nwhich potential causal factors are active in all systems satisfying\n\\(K\\) (Strevens 2004: 171). Eventually, Strevens defines \\(C\\) to be a\ncausal factor for \\(E\\) iff it is a member in some explanatory kernel\nfor \\(E\\). Causes, in the kairetic account, are difference-makers with\nrespect to the effect. If we were to take an actual cause out of an\nexplanatory kernel for \\(E\\), the remainder of the kernel would not\nproduce the putative effect \\(E\\).\n\nLet us try to understand why the description of the cause should be\nmaximally general. There are three reasons for this. First, this\nrequirement allows us to eliminate potential causal factors that do\nnot contribute to the causal production of the effect. A kernel \\(K\\)\nthat does mention such a factor\u2014in addition to the\n\u201cactive\u201d causal factors\u2014is less general than a\nkernel \\(K'\\) that mentions only the \u201cactive\u201d causal\nfactors. Hence, \\(K'\\) should be preferred over \\(K\\), other things\nbeing equal.\n\nPut simply, some elements of a veridical causal model are not involved\nin the production of the effect. Other elements are involved, but\ntheir influence can be neglected, provided the description of the\neffect is not overly fine-grained. For example, the gravitational\nforces of other planets may influence the trajectory of a rock thrown\nnearby the Earth\u2019s surface. But these forces do not make a\ndifference to whether or not the rock hits a fragile object. Hence,\nthe kernel should not contain such forces. More generally, a kernel\nfor \\(E\\) should not contain elements of \\(M\\) that are involved in\nthe production of \\(E\\) without actually making a difference to it.\nThis gives us a second reason for the requirement of generality.\n\nThese two reasons for optimizing generality are motivated by a\nconsideration of difference-making: each member of the kernel should\nmake a difference to the production of the effect. If some member of\nthe kernel is absent, the remainder of the kernel does not suffice to\nbring about the effect. Otherwise, it is not a proper kernel for the\neffect.\n\nThe third reason for optimizing generality of the kernel is a bit more\nintricate. Suppose a brick of four kilograms is thrown against a\nwindow such that the window shatters. Then, for this effect to be\nbrought about, it is often not necessary that the brick has a weight\nof exactly four kilograms. A brick that is slightly lighter and thrown\nwith the same velocity would also do. Nor does it have to be a brick,\nas we know from the rock-throwing examples. So it seems more accurate\nto say that the shattering of the window was caused by the fact or\nevent that a rigid, non-elastic, and sharp object was thrown against\nthe window in such a manner that the object\u2019s impact was within\na certain interval. The latter description is obviously more general\nthan the former in the sense that more physical systems satisfy it. In\nbrief, the kernel for \\(E\\) should not contain aspects of causally\nrelevant factors that do not make a difference to \\(E\\).\n\nThe requirement of cohesion is needed to exclude disjunctions of\ncausal factors from a kernel. Suppose \\(C_1\\) is a potential, but\ninactive causal factor, while \\(C_2\\) is active. That is, \\(C_2\\) is\nactually contributing to the causal production of \\(E\\), and \\(C_1\\)\nis not. Then neither \\(C_1\\) nor \\(C_1 \\vee C_2\\) should be part of\nthe kernel. We have just seen how \\(C_1\\) is excluded from the kernel\nby the requirement to maximize generality. \\(C_1 \\vee C_2\\) is\nexcluded by requiring that the kernel should be maximally cohesive.\nOther things being equal, kernels with \\(\\{C_1 \\vee C_2\\}\\) and\n\\(\\{C_1, C_1 \\vee C_2\\}\\) are less cohesive than the kernel containing\njust \\(\\{C_2\\}\\).\n\nStrevens (2008) is more comprehensive, and addresses a number of\nfurther topics, most of which are primarily concerned with the notion\nof an explanation. Notably, an account is offered for singular causal\nrelations without a corresponding regular connection between the\npresumed cause and the putative effect (Ch. 11).\n",
