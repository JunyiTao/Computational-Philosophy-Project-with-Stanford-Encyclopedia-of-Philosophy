    "main_text": "Ideology and the Rule of Law\n4. Ideology and the Rule of Law\n\n\nAll this points to another and related tension. This is the tension\nbetween the radical ideology view and the concept of the rule of law, the\ncentrepiece of a liberal legal order. At their most basic, the terms\nthe rule of law, due process, procedural justice, legal formality,\nprocedural rationality, justice as regularity, all refer to the idea\nthat law should meet certain procedural requirements so that the\nindividual is enabled to obey it. These requirements center on the\nprinciple that the law be general, that it take the form of\nrules. Law by definition should be directed to more than a\nparticular situation or individual; as Lon Fuller notes, the rule of\nlaw also requires that law be relatively certain, clearly expressed,\nopen, prospective and adequately publicised.\n\n\nThe view of law as ideology, even in its radical variants, would not\ndeny the presence of the rule of law in the liberal legal order;\nindeed, the rule of law is often invoked as a paradigmatic example of\nlegal ideology. This is because, however, the rule of law is\ninterpreted as a device that serves the interests of the powerful;\nmoreover, it is a device that dissembles itself. The rule of law, in\nits restraint on the exercise of governmental and judicial power,\nfacilitates the aims of those with power of other kinds, particularly\neconomic power. This is not a surprising argument, if one considers how\nright-wing thinkers like Frederick Hayek (1971, 57\u20139) have lauded the rule of law\nfor its essential role in buttressing the free market. Left wing and\nright wing thinkers are agreed, then, on the capitalist function of the\nrule of law.\n\n\nFor the left-wing theorist of ideology, however, the rule of law\nalso has ideological aspects that mean it serves capitalist purposes in\nmore sinister ways. For in its restraint on political and legal power,\nthe rule of law implies that these public forms of power are the only\nforms of power that exist, or at least the only ones that matter.\nMoreover, in assuring the subjects of the law that that law is applied\nwith generality and certainty, the rule of law also implies that formal\njustice is the only relevant kind of justice; that equality before the\nlaw is identical to equality per se.\n\n\nThese claims about the rule of law and ideology are complex and need\ncareful scrutiny. Does the rule of law necessarily involve manipulation\non behalf of the capitalist order? Given its formal virtues, and its\nagnosticism on the content of law, the rule of law seems innocent of\ncharges of a capitalist bias, or a bias of any kind. As Raz puts it,\nthe rule of law\u2019s virtue is like the virtue of a sharp knife; it\nenables the law to fulfill its function, whatever the function might\nbe (Raz 1979). Moreover, it is hard to see how the rule of law itself is engaged\nin any project of deception. Generality in the law, for example, does\nnot necessarily entail any particular commitments on how the economy or\nsociety should be organized; nor does it propagate falsity or error.\nNonetheless, it is true that the proceduralism of the rule of law can\nbe put to ideological purposes, to deflect social criticism and prevent\nradical change. And if enthusiasts of the rule of law place enough\nemphasis on procedural justice, this can reduce the likelihood that\nmore substantive conceptions of justice will have success.\nHistorically, societies governed by the rule of law have tended to be\nstructured by capitalist markets, suggesting an affinity between the\ntwo sets of institutions. The rule of law can have an ideological\neffect even if it is not ideological in its essence.\n",
