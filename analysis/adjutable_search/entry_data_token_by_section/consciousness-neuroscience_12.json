For example, it is deployed in arguing that some\npatients diagnosed as being in the vegetative state are conscious\n(Shea & Bayne 2010; see also Drayson 2014).\n\n\nA patient in the vegetative state appears at times to be wakeful, with\ncycles of eye closure and eye opening resembling those of sleep and\nwaking. However, close observation reveals no sign of awareness or of\na \u2018functioning mind\u2019: specifically, there is no evidence\nthat the patient can perceive the environment or his/her own body,\ncommunicate with others, or form intentions. As a rule, the patient\ncan breathe spontaneously and has a stable circulation. The state may\nbe a transient stage in the recovery from coma or it may persist until\ndeath. (Working Party RCP 2003: 249)\n\n\nVegetative state patients are not clinically comatose but fall short\nof being in a \u201cminimally conscious state\u201d. Unlike\nvegetative state patients, minimally conscious state patients\nseemingly perform intentional actions.\n\nRecent work suggests that some patients diagnosed as in the vegetative\nstate are conscious. Owen et al. (2006) used fMRI to demonstrate\ncorrelated activity in such patients in response to commands to deploy\nimagination. In an early study, a young female patient was scanned by\nfMRI while presented with three auditory commands: \u201cimagine\nplaying tennis\u201d, \u201cimagine visiting the rooms in your\nhome\u201d, \u201cnow just relax\u201d. The commands were presented\nat the beginning of a thirty-second period, alternating between\nimagination and relax commands. The patient demonstrated similar\nactivity when matched to control subjects performing the same task:\nsustained activation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) was\nobserved during the motor imagery task while sustained activation of\nthe parahippocampal gyrus including the parahippocampal place area\n(PPA) was observed during the spatial imagery task. Later work\nreproduced this result in other patients and in one patient, the tasks\nwere used as a proxy for \u201cyes\u201d/ \u201cno\u201d responses\nto questions (Monti et al. 2010; for a review, see\nFern\u00e1ndez-Espejo & Owen 2013). Note that these tasks probe\nspecific contents of consciousness by monitoring neural\ncorrelates of conscious imagery.\n\nSeveral authors (Greenberg 2007; Nachev & Husain 2007) have\ncountered that the observed activity was an automatic, non-intentional\nresponse to the command sentences, specifically to the words\n\u201ctennis\u201d and \u201chouse\u201d. In normal subjects,\nreading action words is known to activate sensorimotor areas\n(Pulverm\u00fcller 2005). Owen et al. (2007), responded that the\nsustained activity over thirty-seconds made an automatic response less\nlikely than an intentional response. One way to rule out automaticity\nis to provide the patient with different sentences such as \u201cdo\nnot imagine playing tennis\u201d or \u201cSharlene\nwas playing tennis\u201d. Owen et al. (2007) demonstrated that\npresenting \u201cSharlene was playing tennis\u201d to a normal\nsubject did not induce the same activity as when the subject obeyed\nthe command \u201cimagine playing tennis\u201d, but the result was\nnot duplicated in patients. \n\nOwen et al. draw on a neural correlate of imagination, a mental\naction. Arguing that the neural correlate provides evidence of the\npatient\u2019s executing an intentional action, they invoke a version\nof the Intentional Action Inference to argue that performance provides\nevidence for specific consciousness tied to the information carried in\nthe brain areas activated. Of note, experiments stimulating the\nparahippocampal place area induces seeming hallucinations of places\n(M\u00e9gevand et al.\n 2014).[7]\n",
