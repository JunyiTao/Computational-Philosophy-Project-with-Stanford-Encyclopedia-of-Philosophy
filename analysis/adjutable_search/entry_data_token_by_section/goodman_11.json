    "main_text": "The Old and the New Riddle of Induction and their Solution || Hume\u2019s Problem, Logic, and Reflective Equilibrium\n5.2 Hume\u2019s Problem, Logic, and Reflective Equilibrium\nIf the problem of induction is not how to justify induction in the\nsense mentioned above, then what is it? It is helpful here to look at\nthe case of deduction. Instances of deductive inferences are justified\nby showing that they are inferences in accordance with valid rules of\ninference. According to Goodman, the rules of logic are in turn valid\nbecause they are more or less in accordance with what we intuitively\naccept as instances of a valid deductive inference (FFF, 64).\nOn the one hand, we have certain intuitions about which deductive\ninferences are valid; on the other hand we have rules of inference.\nConfronted with an intuitively valid inference, we check whether it\naccords to the rules we already accept. If it does not, we might\nreject the inference as invalid. If, however, our intuition that the\npurported inference is valid is stronger than our confidence that our\nlogical rules are adequate, we might consider amending the rules. This\nsoon leads to a complicated process. We have to take into account that\nthe rules must remain coherent and not too complicated to apply. In\nlogic, we want the rules to be, for example, topic neutral, i.e.,\napplicable to inferences (as far as possible) independent of specific\nsubject matter. On the other hand, we also want to extract as much\ninformation from premises as possible, so we do not want to risk being\ntoo cautious in accepting rules. In this process we make adjustments\non both sides, slowly bringing our judgments concerning validity into\na reflective equilibrium with the rules for valid inferences\nuntil we finally get a stable system of accepted rules. (The term\n \u201creflective equilibrium\u201d\nwas introduced by John Rawls (1971) for Goodman\u2019s technique.)\nReflective equilibrium is a story about how we actually\njustify our inferential practices. According to Goodman, nothing more\ncan be demanded or achieved. It seems, perhaps, prima facie\ndesirable that we also seek a justification in the sense of the old\nproblem, but Hume\u2019s argument suggests that such a justification is\nimpossible. If this is correct, the remaining problem is to define our\ninferential practices by bringing explicit rules into reflective\nequilibrium with our tutored intuitions. \u201cJustified\u201d or\n\u201cvalid\u201d are predicates that are applied to inferences on\nthis basis.\nIt thus also becomes clearer how Goodman thought about Hume\u2019s\nsolution\u2014that induction is merely a matter of custom or habit.\nHume\u2019s solution might be incomplete, but it is basically correct.  The\nremaining task is then to explicate the pre-theoretic notion of valid\ninductive inference by defining rules of inference that can be brought\ninto a reflective equilibrium with intuitive judgments of inductive\nvalidity.\n",
