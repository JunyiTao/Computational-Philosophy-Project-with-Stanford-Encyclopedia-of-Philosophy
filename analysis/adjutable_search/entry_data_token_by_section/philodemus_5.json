Influence\n\n\nEpicureans were largely excluded from the philosophical project of\nsynthesizing Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic doctrines which came to\nprominence beginning in Philodemus\u2019 own day. The Epicureans\nthemselves had a reputation for doctrinal orthodoxy and for attributing\nany or all of their true statements to one or more of the\nschool\u2019s founders (cf. Numenius, On the Academics\u2019\nbetrayal of Plato, fr. 24.22\u201336 = Eusebius, Praeparatio\nEvangelica 14.5.3 and Seneca, Letters to Lucilius\n33.2\u20134). A number of later Epicureans relied almost exclusively on the\nearliest Epicurean texts, never mentioning those of later generations.\nThis is most famously the case for Philodemus\u2019 contemporary,\nLucretius, but also for the second century CE Epicurean Diogenes of\nOenoanda. The same tendency can be seen in other philosophers, as well:\nSeneca cites sayings of Epicurus, on the grounds that the truth is\ncommon property, while the Academic Plutarch attacks texts of the\nfirst-generation Epicurean Colotes. Philodemus\u2019 own texts,\nhowever, along with those of Demetrius of Laconia and Polystratus, show\nthat there was indeed a good deal of infighting among members of the\nschool, at least after its first generation, much of it centered on\ndiffering interpretations of the founders\u2019 doctrines.\n\n\nDiogenes Laertius 10.3\u2019s citation of Book 10 of the\nCollection of the Philosophers is the only explicit mention\nof a philosophical work of Philodemus among ancient authors. Close\ncorrespondence between some of the last part of On Piety and\nCicero\u2019s On the Nature of the Gods 1.25\u201341 may indicate\nthat Cicero used Philodemus\u2019 book as a source, or that the two had a\ncommon source, perhaps Zeno of Sidon. Cicero may also have used\ncontemporary Epicurean sources for the views put by Epicurean\nsurrogates in some of his other works: his character\n\u2018Cicero\u2019 mentions his (or Torquatus\u2019) friends Siro and\nPhilodemus as authorities to whom Torquatus could appeal for help\nagainst the attack made on Epicurean ethics by \u2018Cicero\u2019\n(On Moral Ends 2.119). The approach to the liberal arts\nsignaled by Sextus Empiricus in M 1\u20136 as characteristic\nof \u2018the Epicureans\u2019 is very similar to what we see in\nPhilodemus\u2019 works, as explained above (Section 2.2.5.3.5); Philodemus\nand/or Zeno probably served as Sextus\u2019 sources for this material.\nOnce the philosophical works of Philodemus began to be edited and\nto come to the attention of scholars in the later 19th century, his\ninfluence begins to be seen, albeit sporadically. C. S. Peirce, who\nwas impressed by Epicurean philosophy, especially\nthe clinamen or \u2018swerve\u2019, studied\nPhilodemus\u2019 On Methods of Inference together with his\nstudent Allan Marquand, whose Ph.D. thesis included the first English\ntranslation of the book. It was apparently from Philodemus that Peirce\ntook the term \u2018semiosis\u2019 in his characerization of\nsemiotics as \u2018the doctrine of the essential nature and\nfundamental varieties of semiosis\u2019 (cf. Fisch\n[1971] 1986 and Deledalle 2001).\nRecently, scholars of early Christianity have become interested in\nthe ways Epicureans held their school together, especially\nEpicurus\u2019 use of letters, many of which explained points of\ndoctrine and served as epitomes of his major works. These scholars\nhave related Philodemus\u2019 remarks on the conduct of an Epicurean\nschool and the relations between more advanced and less experienced\nmembers, especially in his book On Frank Criticism, to the\nwork of the Apostle Paul and his pastoral Epistles (cf. Glad\n2004).\n",
