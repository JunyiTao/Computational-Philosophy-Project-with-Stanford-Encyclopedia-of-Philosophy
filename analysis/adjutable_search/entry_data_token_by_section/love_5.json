    "main_text": "Love as Valuing || Love as Bestowal of Value\n4.2 Love as Bestowal of Value\n\nIn contrast to Velleman, Singer (1991, 1994, 2009) understands love to\nbe fundamentally a matter of bestowing value on the beloved. To\nbestow value on another is to project a kind of intrinsic\nvalue onto him. Indeed, this fact about love is supposed to\ndistinguish love from liking: \u201cLove is an attitude with no clear\nobjective,\u201d whereas liking is inherently teleological (1991, p.\n272). As such, there are no standards of correctness for bestowing\nsuch value, and this is how love differs from other personal attitudes\nlike gratitude, generosity, and condescension:\n\u201clove\u2026confers importance no matter what the\nobject is worth\u201d (p. 273). Consequently, Singer thinks, love is\nnot an attitude that can be justified in any way.\n\nWhat is it, exactly, to bestow this kind of value on someone? It is,\nSinger says, a kind of attachment and commitment to the beloved, in\nwhich one comes to treat him as an end in himself and so to respond to\nhis ends, interests, concerns, etc. as having value for their own\nsake. This means in part that the bestowal of value reveals itself\n\u201cby caring about the needs and interests of the beloved, by\nwishing to benefit or protect her, by delighting in her\nachievements,\u201d etc. (p. 270). This sounds very much like the\nrobust concern view, yet the bestowal view differs in understanding\nsuch robust concern to be the effect of the bestowal of value\nthat is love rather than itself what constitutes love: in bestowing\nvalue on my beloved, I make him be valuable in such a way that I ought\nto respond with robust concern.\n\nFor it to be intelligible that I have bestowed value on someone, I\nmust therefore respond appropriately to him as valuable, and this\nrequires having some sense of what his well-being is and of what\naffects that well-being positively or negatively. Yet having this\nsense requires in turn knowing what his strengths and deficiencies\nare, and this is a matter of appraising him in various ways. Bestowal\nthus presupposes a kind of appraisal, as a way of \u201creally\nseeing\u201d the beloved and attending to him. Nonetheless, Singer\nclaims, it is the bestowal that is primary for understanding what love\nconsists in: the appraisal is required only so that the commitment to\none\u2019s beloved and his value as thus bestowed has practical\nimport and is not \u201ca blind submission to some unknown\nbeing\u201d (1991, p. 272; see also Singer 1994, pp. 139ff).\n\nSinger is walking a tightrope in trying to make room for appraisal in\nhis account of love. Insofar as the account is fundamentally a\nbestowal account, Singer claims that love cannot be justified, that we\nbestow the relevant kind of value \u201cgratuitously.\u201d This\nsuggests that love is blind, that it does not matter what our beloved\nis like, which seems patently false. Singer tries to avoid this\nconclusion by appealing to the role of appraisal: it is only because\nwe appraise another as having certain virtues and vices that we come\nto bestow value on him. Yet the \u201cbecause\u201d here, since it\ncannot justify the bestowal, is at best a kind of contingent causal\nexplanation.\n [10]\n In this respect, Singer\u2019s account of the selectivity of love is\nmuch the same as Velleman\u2019s, and it is liable to the same\ncriticism: it makes unintelligible the way in which our love can be\ndiscerning for better or worse reasons. Indeed, this failure to make\nsense of the idea that love can be justified is a problem for any\nbestowal view. For either (a) a bestowal itself cannot be justified\n(as on Singer\u2019s account), in which case the justification of\nlove is impossible, or (b) a bestowal can be justified, in which case\nit is hard to make sense of value as being bestowed rather than there\nantecedently in the object as the grounds of that\n\u201cbestowal.\u201d\n\nMore generally, a proponent of the bestowal view needs to be much\nclearer than Singer is in articulating precisely what a bestowal is.\nWhat is the value that I create in a bestowal, and how can my bestowal\ncreate it? On a crude Humean view, the answer might be that the value\nis something projected onto the world through my pro-attitudes, like\ndesire. Yet such a view would be inadequate, since the projected\nvalue, being relative to a particular individual, would do no\ntheoretical work, and the account would essentially be a variant of\nthe robust concern view. Moreover, in providing a bestowal account of\nlove, care is needed to distinguish love from other personal attitudes\nsuch as admiration and respect: do these other attitudes involve\nbestowal? If so, how does the bestowal in these cases differ from the\nbestowal of love? If not, why not, and what is so special about love\nthat requires a fundamentally different evaluative attitude than\nadmiration and respect?\n\nNonetheless, there is a kernel of truth in the bestowal view: there is\nsurely something right about the idea that love is creative and not\nmerely a response to antecedent value, and accounts of love that\nunderstand the kind of evaluation implicit in love merely in terms of\nappraisal seem to be missing something. Precisely what may be missed\nwill be discussed below in\n Section 6.\n",
