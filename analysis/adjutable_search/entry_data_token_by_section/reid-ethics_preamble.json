    "main_text": "\n\nWe are often told that the moral theories defended by modern\nphilosophers fall into two types. On the one hand are rationalist\npositions developed by thinkers such as Samuel Clarke, William\nWollaston, and Richard Price. The rationalists, it is said, believe\nthat reason is the basis of morality, as morality is (in some sense)\nboth grounded in and grasped by reason. On the other hand are\nsentimentalist positions championed by philosophers such as the Third\nEarl of Shaftesbury, Francis Hutcheson, and David Hume. The\nsentimentalists, it is claimed, hold that affect is the basis of\nmorality. According to the standard classification, the\nsentimentalists believe that morality has relatively little to do with\nreason, as it is (in some sense) both grounded in and discerned by\nsentiment.\n\nThomas Reid\u2019s (1710\u20131796) moral philosophy does not neatly\nfit into this scheme of classification. To be sure, some characterize\nReid as a rationalist working within the tradition of Clarke and Price\n(see MacIntyre 1966 and Rawls 2000, Introduction). One can see why.\nReid, after all, affirms core rationalist claims, such as that there\nis a body of necessary moral principles that are self-evident to the\nordinary person. But there are important elements of Reid\u2019s\nthought that do not fit the rationalist paradigm. For example, Reid\ndefends the view that all normal, mature human beings are endowed with\na moral sense. Like philosophers such as Hutcheson and Hume, Reid\nclaims that the moral sense yields sentiments of various sorts that\nthemselves occasion \u201cour first moral conceptions,\u201d such as\nthe apprehension that an act is approbation-worthy (EAP V.ii: 279).\nThis account of concept formation, according to some philosophers,\nwould make Reid\u2019s position a version of sentimentalism (see\nD\u2019Arms 2005). In this respect, Reid\u2019s position resembles\nnot Clarke\u2019s and Price\u2019s but Hutcheson\u2019s and\nHume\u2019s.\n\nThere is, then, a sense in which Reid\u2019s moral philosophy resists\nready categorization. It is neither a version of rationalism nor\nsentimentalism, but an attempt to blend those features from both these\ntraditions that Reid found most attractive. This presents a challenge\nto the contemporary interpreter of Reid\u2019s moral philosophy. One\nwonders: Is Reid\u2019s theory of morals an exotic hybrid, one which\neludes the categories used by contemporary philosophers to describe\nethical theories?\n\nNot exactly. Anyone familiar with contemporary moral philosophy could\nnot fail to miss the resemblance that Reid\u2019s position bears to\nthe view defended some one hundred and fifty years later by W. D. Ross\n(see Ross 2002). Although Ross never mentions Reid as an influence,\nboth thinkers operate within a broadly non-naturalist framework\naccording to which the sciences offer us limited insight into the\nnature of moral reality. In so doing, they both stood against powerful\ntrends in their day to \u201cnaturalize\u201d ethics. Moreover, both\nreject monistic accounts of the moral domain, such as those defended\nby Kantians and consequentialists, according to which there is one\nmaster ethical principle from which all others are derived. According\nto both Reid and Ross, there is instead a plurality of self-evident\nmoral first principles, none of which is reducible to another.\n\nIn light of this, we might describe Reid\u2019s position as a\nproto-Rossian version of ethical intuitionism. While such a\ndescription is tempting, it would probably be misleading. For the\nparallels between Reid and Ross extend only so far. The most important\ndifference between the two thinkers is this: Ross frames his project\nin the light of G. E. Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument and\nMill\u2019s utilitarianism\u2014two philosophical topics about which\nReid knew nothing. Reid, by contrast, developed his version of ethical\nintuitionism within the context of a defense of a certain account of\nhuman agency, according to which each of us is endowed with\n\u201cactive power\u201d which we can freely exercise. Reid believed\nthat this account of human agency, when coupled with our best\nscientific knowledge, yields a form of non-naturalist ethical\nintuitionism. Call a position that grounds many of its core\nmetaethical claims about the nature of moral reality in a particular\nview of human agency an agency-centered account.\nAgency-centered views tell us that in order to understand the nature\nof moral reality we must first examine the nature of agency.\nReid\u2019s is an agency-centered version of ethical intuitionism.\nRoss\u2019s, by contrast, is not.\n\nThe project of this essay is to present both the motivations for and\nfundamental contours of Reid\u2019s agency-centered intuitionist\nview. Before diving into the details of Reid\u2019s position,\nhowever, it may be worth saying a word about the influence of\nReid\u2019s views in contemporary ethics. If one were to gauge this\ninfluence by the number of books or articles written in the last one\nhundred years about Reid\u2019s ethics, one would have to conclude\nthat his influence is negligible. Very little has been written about\nReid\u2019s moral philosophy. Indeed, Reid is not even included in\nwhat is perhaps the standard anthology on the British Moralists, the\ntwo-volume work edited by Selby-Bigge of the same title (Selby-Bigge\n1965). Moreover, one would also have to conclude that Reid\u2019s\ninfluence on moral philosophers who receive a great deal of attention,\nsuch as Moore, is marginal. For example, in the flurry of work\nproduced in 2003 on the centenary of the publication of Moore\u2019s\nPrincipia Ethica, no one mentions Reid as an influence on\nMoore\u2019s ethical views.\n\nThe reality of the matter, however, is that Reid has indeed exercised\nconsiderable influence on contemporary moral philosophy, albeit\nindirectly. This influence runs primarily through Henry Sidgwick, who\nknew Reid\u2019s work well (see Sidgwick 2000, Ch. 16). Sidgwick, it\nseems, exposed his student, G. E. Moore, to Reid\u2019s views (see\nBeanblossom 1983). Reid\u2019s broadly common sense methodology and\nhis positive views were subsequently taken up by Moore. Among the more\nsalient similarities one finds in their ethical views is that both\nthinkers are interested in whether the fundamental moral properties\nare definable. Reid claims they are not; fundamental moral properties\nare, in Reid\u2019s estimation, simple, indefinable, and sui generis\n(EAP III.iii.v). Famously, Moore said the same, although for somewhat\ndifferent reasons. And the rest, as they say, is history. Depending on\none\u2019s views, one might view this history as one in which Moore\nfinally put ethical theory on the right track or, alternatively,\npushed it off the rails. Whatever one\u2019s opinion on this issue,\nReid seems to have had a role in its direction.\n",
