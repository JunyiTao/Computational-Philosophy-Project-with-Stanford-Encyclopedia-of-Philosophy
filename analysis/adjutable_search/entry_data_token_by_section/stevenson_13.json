    "main_text": "Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Emotivism || Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Account of Moral Thought\n5.1 Objections to Stevenson\u2019s Account of Moral Thought\n\nStevenson holds a non-cognitivist view, according to which moral\njudgments or thoughts are essentially constituted at least in part by\ndesire-like attitudes, feelings, or interests, those mental states\nwhose general character is to be for or against\nsomething. Several objections to Stevenson\u2019s theory have been due to\nperceived implications of non-cognitivism.\n\nObjection from Moral Properties. According to this objection,\nif non-cognitivism is true, then something is bad (good, evil, etc.)\nonly if a person has an unfavorable attitude towards it; however,\nhaving such an attitude (the objection goes) cannot be a necessary\ncondition for an event\u2019s being bad (good, evil, etc.). Consider, for\nexample, Blanshard\u2019s (1949) example in which a rabbit has been caught\nin a severe hunting trap for several days, causing the rabbit\nunnecessary, prolonged, and extreme agony. According to Blanshard\u2019s\nunderstanding of non-cognitivism, until a person has an unfavorable\nattitude towards such an event or state of affairs, the rabbit\u2019s being\nin such agony would not be bad. Since (the objection continues) this\nconclusion is absurd, Stevenson\u2019s account of moral thought must be\nfalse. However, this objection conflates Stevenson\u2019s theory of moral\nthought with a theory of moral properties, assuming as it does that\nhaving, for example, an unfavorable attitude towards an event\nconstitutes the badness of that event, at least in part. But\nthis is the kind of moral metaphysics that Stevenson\u2019s theory is\ndesigned to avoid. According to Stevenson, either there is nothing\nthat constitutes badness (or goodness, etc.), because there are no\nsuch moral properties, or, perhaps better: questions concerning what\nconstitutes the badness of an event are ethical questions of\nwhat to disapprove of\u2014questions to which non-cognitivism as a\nmetaethical theory offers no answers. Non-cognitivism is\nsilent on what it is in virtue of which things have the moral\nproperties that they have (if they have any). It just tells us what it\nis to think that something is bad.\n\nObjection from Unemotional Moral Judgments. Blanshard also\ninvites us to consider a person who thinks, with great contempt, that\nunnecessary, prolonged, extreme agony is bad and claims repeatedly\nthat it is bad, still repeating the claim even a week later though\nfatigue has dissipated all contempt:\n\n\nWhen we repeat the remark that such suffering was a bad thing, the\nfeeling with which we made it last week may be at or near the\nvanishing point, but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we\ndid before, we should certainly answer Yes. We should say that we made\nour point with feeling the first time and little or no feeling the\nsecond time, but that it was the same point we were making. And if we\nsee that what we meant to say remains the same, while the feeling\nvaries from intensity to near zero, it is not the feeling that we\nprimarily meant to express. (1949, 45)\n\n\nThe possibility of continuing to think that a certain event is bad,\neven though the attitude or feeling with which one originally judged\nthe event as bad has partially or even completely dissipated over time\nmay seem incompatible with non-cognitivism. However, it is not clear\nthat this is correct. Stevenson\u2019s account of the meaning of evaluative\njudgments, given in complex dispositional terms (see\n Section 3.2),\n allows for considerable variability in terms of the kinds of feelings\nthat may or may not attend a moral judgment. (Similar considerations\nwould apply to the question regarding whether it is possible to hold a\nmoral judgment without being suitably motivated. For\ndiscussion, see, e.g., Svavarsd\u00f3ttir 1999.)\n\nObjection from Moral Chaos. Stevenson grants that moral\ndisagreement may sometimes be rationally irresolvable. Some might\nworry that if this is so, then moral chaos is likely to ensue. Taking\nthis objection to heart, Blanshard goes as far as to claim that\n\u201c[The general acceptance of strong emotivism] would, so far as\none can see, be an international disaster\u201d (1949). Stevenson\ncould simply respond that even if true, this would not imply that his\naccount of moral thought is false. However, he also suggests that such\nan objection arises from fear that cannot be assuaged by postulating\nsome objective truth or robust moral properties awaiting to be\ndiscovered (e.g., 1944, 336 and 1950a, 68\u201370). Rather, such fear\ncan be assuaged only when we have a clear, realistic understanding of\nthe nature and complexity of moral disagreement and of the methods by\nwhich they can be, and often are, resolved:\n\n\nThe present analysis can afford no assurance that dictators and\nself-seeking politicians, whose skill in exhortation is so manifest,\n\u201cinevitably must\u201d fail, if left unopposed, in reshaping\nmoral codes to serve their narrow interests. \u2026 But this much\nmust be said: Those who cherish altruism, and look forward to a time\nwhen a stable society will be governed by farsighted men, will serve\nthese ideals poorly by turning from present troubles to fancied\nrealms. For these ideals, like all other attitudes, are not imposed\nupon human nature by esoteric forces; they are a part of human nature\nitself. If they are to become a more integral part of it, they must be\nfought for. They must be fought for with the words \u2018right\u2019\nand \u2018wrong\u2019, else these attitude-molding weapons will be\nleft to the use of opponents. And they must be supported with\nclear-minded reasons, else hypostatic obscurantism will bring\ncontempt to the cause it is intended to plead. (1944, 110; see also\n1961\u201362b)\n\n\nObjection from Normativity. Stevenson writes that whether a\nstatement, adduced as a reason in support of an ethical judgment,\n\u201cwill in fact support or oppose the judgment will depend on\nwhether the hearer believes it, and upon whether if he does, it will\nactually make a difference to his attitudes,\u201d and that such\nstatement or consideration \u201cmay conveniently be called a reason\n(though not necessarily a \u2018valid\u2019 one) regardless of\nwhether it is accepted or not\u201d (1944, 115). It may easily seem,\nthen, as if Stevenson would wish to explain what it is for some\nconsideration, R, to count in favor of some action,\nfor instance, in terms of the causal efficacy of citing R in\nproducing the action in question, or in altering attitudes. It may\nseem as if he would wish to explain normativity, or\nnormative authority, directly in terms of psychological impact. This\nmay seem implausible, regardless of the details of the psychological\nstory.\n\nObjection from Irrelevant Reasons. Moreover, Stevenson\u2019s\naccount of reasons seems to deliver wrong results, as what is\npsychologically effective is not always normatively relevant. A\ncolleague of Stevenson\u2019s, Richard Brandt, put the worry as\nfollows:\n\n\nOn the emotive theory, \u2026 if one is moved to disapprove\nsocialized medicine by the thought that any expression of approval\nwould oust him from his favorite club, he has been moved, according to\nthe emotive theory, by as ethically relevant a consideration as any\nother he might have thought of. Now, I do not think this describes\nordinary ethical thinking; we think some persuasive beliefs are\ndistinctly irrelevant. (Brandt 1950a, 313)\n\n\nThe last two objections are based on a misunderstanding. We may give\nthe response in Stevenson\u2019s own words:\n\n\n\u2026 to say that a reason is \u201crelevant\u201d to a judgment\nis sometimes to say that the reason \u2026 ought to make a\ndifference to it. In this sense most people will agree that a\nman\u2019s being ousted from his club is \u201cirrelevant\u201d to his\njudgment about socialized medicine; for they will feel his judgment\nought not be influenced by such consideration. Whenever we\nsay what a man\u2019s reasons ought to be, we are making a judgment of our\nown about the way he reaches his judgment. That is\nan important thing to do, but it is not a part of the specialized task\nthat I have set for myself. I have tried not to judge but only to\nunderstand what goes on in ethics\u2014my metanormative inquiry being\nitself nonnormative. (1950c, 528)\n\n\nSo, Stevenson escapes the Objection from Normativity because he is\nnot offering an account of normative authority, or of\nreasonhood, in terms of efficacy in modifying attitudes. And he escapes\nthe Objection from Irrelevant Reasons because nothing in his theory\nsuggests that what is ethically relevant, or what is a (good) reason\nfor what, would be determined by such considerations of efficacy.\nThere remains, of course, an interesting challenge regarding how,\nexactly, we should understand judgments about normative reasons, or\nabout ethical relevance\u2014an issue which Stevenson does not\naddress in any detail (for Brandt\u2019s concerns regarding what remarks\nStevenson offers, see Brandt 1950b; for a more recent discussion of\nthis challenge in the context of contemporary expressivist views, see\nSinclair 2016).\n\nObjection from Fallibility. An interesting challenge is\narticulated by Stevenson himself, regarding our judgments of ethical\nfallibility. The question here is whether Stevenson\u2019s emotive theory\nallows us to \u201cprovide a proper place\u201d for \u201cour\nwillingness to acknowledge that our judgments must often be held open\nto correction, as distinct from being proclaimed in a manner implying\nthat we have said the last word\u201d (1968, 203). We need (1) an\naccount of expressions of ethical fallibility, and (2) an explanation\nfor why it makes sense to acknowledge our fallibility, given the\nemotivist account of the phenomenon. So, first, what does an\nexpression of ethical fallibility amount to, on the emotivist view?\nStevenson suggests that just as we may acknowledge fallibility in\nbelief by saying \u201cMany things that I believe to be the case may\nnot be the case,\u201d we may also acknowledge fallibility in attitude\nby saying \u201cMany things that meet with my approval may not be\nright\u201d (1968, 206). The function of this sort of acknowledgement\nis to indicate that the speaker is \u201cprepared, on further\nreflection,\u201d to change their mind, which creates \u201chope for\ntwo-way discussion\u201d and allays fears to the effect that the\naudience would be expected to listen to the speaker as their\n\u201cdisciples\u201d (1968, 207\u2013210). This preparedness to\nrevise one\u2019s attitudes is a matter of expecting that there are reasons\nfor approving or disapproving that one has yet to consider (1968,\n214\u2013215). On Stevenson\u2019s account of such reasons, it would then\nbe a matter of thinking that there may be considerations such that\nought to influence one to revise one\u2019s attitudes. Stevenson\u2019s brief\nremarks on the topic do not provide us with a detailed account of\nfallibility judgments, but it is suggestive of a later and much\ndiscussed proposal by Blackburn (1998, 318; for discussion, see Egan\n2007 and, e.g., the literature cited in Bex-Priestley 2018).\n\nGiven the emotivist account of moral thought and discourse, does it\nmake sense to acknowledge our fallibility? Stevenson puts the\nworry as follows:\n\n\nWe acknowledge our fallibility in science, it may be urged, because we\nare convinced that the universe, as studied by science, is in some\nsense \u201cout there\u201d to be described. \u2026 When we\nexpress beliefs about these facts, then, we are very far from being\nnon-objective painters, who are free to make such designs as they\nwill. Instead, we are realistic painters, intent on being faithful to\nwhat we are representing. Now it is our attempt to be faithful to the\nfacts of the universe, it may be urged, that leads us to acknowledge\nour scientific fallibility. The facts may belie our beliefs,\njust as the objects that a realistic painter is painting may belie his\npicture. \u2026 But in ethics, the objection continues, so\nlong as that discipline is conceived as involving an expression of\nattitudes, we have no such situation. We of necessity become\nnon-objective painters rather than realistic painters, for we find\nnothing \u201cout there\u201d for our attitudes to represent.\n\u2026 And why, it may be asked, so long as we accept this\nconception of ethics, should we have any incentive to acknowledge\nour fallibility? (1968, 211\u2013212)\n\n\nStevenson replies that this worry is mistaken both in what it expects\nfor ethics and in what it expects for science. In the case of beliefs,\ntoo, we don\u2019t first look directly at the facts and then to our beliefs\n(as we might compare our model with a portrait that we have painted),\nbut rather \u201caccumulate as many reasons as [we] can that bear on\nthe question\u201d (1968, 213). In both science and in ethics, what\nwe worry about, in acknowledging our fallibility, is the possibility\nof there being reasons for beliefs or attitudes that we haven\u2019t taken\ninto consideration in forming our views. And in both cases, our\nacknowledgments of fallibility serve the important functions of\nencouraging further discussion and inquiry. Given the account of\nfallibility judgments provided by the emotive theory, there is no\nreason to think that our expressions of fallibility in ethics would\nhave to be in any way half-hearted or capricious, and so our\nacknowledgments of fallibility in attitude make perfectly good sense\n(1968, 212\u2013215). Or this is, in any case, Stevenson\u2019s reply to\nthe worry about fallibility, as he construes it.\n",
