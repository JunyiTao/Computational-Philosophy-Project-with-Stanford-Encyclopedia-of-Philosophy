    "main_text": "Mill\u2019s Theoretical Philosophy || The World in the Mind: the Relativity of Knowledge and Mill\u2019s Idealism\n3.6 The World in the Mind: the Relativity of Knowledge and Mill\u2019s Idealism\n\nAs we have seen, Mill holds that \u201ca great part of what seems\nobservation is really inference\u201d (System, VIII: 641).\nThe raw content of experience is itself extremely narrow\u2014indeed,\nMill holds, we directly perceive only our own internal impressions.\n\u201cFrom my senses, I have only the sensations\u201d\n(System, VIII: 643). The claim is a strong one\u2014that\nwhat is directly present to the mind are not external objects, but\nonly \u201ca set of appearances\u201d (System, VIII: 783).\nWe have unmediated access only to the impression that are generated in\nus\u2014we are directly aware only of our own mental content.\n\nWe know of objects in the world only to the extent that they affect us\nand give rise to conscious impressions\u2014and such impressions will\nonly ever be presented by way of the mediating sense faculties. Mill\nclaims that we cannot know anything of objects in themselves, but only\nas they appear to us, and terms this position the \u201cRelativity of\nHuman Knowledge\u201d (Examination, IX: 4). \n\n\n[A]ll the attributes which we ascribe to objects, consist in their\nhaving the power of exciting one or another variety of sensation in\nour mind [\u2026] our knowledge of objects [\u2026] consist[s] of\nnothing but the sensations which they excite. (Examination,\nIX: 6) \n\n\nOur theoretical engagement with the world is always mediated by our\nconditioning faculties\u2014and as such our representations of the\nworld are always representations of what the world is like for beings\nsuch as ourselves.\n\nMill calls this insight \u201cone of great weight and significance,\nwhich impresses a character on the whole mode of philosophical\nthinking of whoever receives it\u201d (Examination, IX: 11).\nThe doctrine ultimately pushes Mill towards Idealism. One might hold\nthat, though we are only familiar in experience with mental\nimpressions, we can nevertheless infer the existence of non-mental\nobjects lying behind such mental objects. But such an\ninference could not be supported within experience by enumerative\ninduction\u2014no non-mental objects are ever observed behind mental\nobjects\u2014but only by a hypothesis to some unobserved entity. As\nwas noted above, however, Mill rejects the method of hypothesis as an\nautonomous form of reasoning\u2014no such inference to unobserved\nnon-mental objects could for him be valid. Mill is forced towards the\nconclusion that we can have no warrant for believing in non-mental\nentities.\n\nAll that can be established inductively is that a certain class of\nobjects of sensation are stable\u2014that they can be returned to,\nafter durations in which they go unperceived. Such, Mill thinks, is\nthe true content of our notion of the external world.\n\n\nMatter, then, may be defined, a Permanent Possibility of Sensation. If\nI am asked, whether I believe in matter, I ask whether the questioner\naccepts this definition of it. If he does, I believe in matter: and so\ndo all Berkeleians. In any other sense than this, I do not.\n(Examination, IX: 183)\n\n\nThe idea of an external world is not present in the content\nof experience. Rather, our idea of externality is derived from the\nrecognition that certain sensations can be revisited: that \n\n\nthough I have ceased to see it [\u2026] I believe that when I again\nplace myself in the circumstances in which I had those sensations\n[\u2026] I shall again have them; and further, that there is no\nintervening moment at which this would not have been the case.\n(Examination, IX: 179) \n\n\nOur idea of matter is exhausted by the idea of \n\n\nsomething which exists when we are not thinking of it; which existed\nbefore we had ever thought and would exist if we were annihilated.\n(Examination, IX: 178\u20139) \n\n\nBut matter, so conceived, is not \u201cintrinsically distinct\u201d\nfrom sensation itself (Examination, IX: 182). Whether this\nstance is entirely coherent, we shall consider below, in\n section 3.7.\n\nMill\u2019s claim about the relativity of knowledge extends to our\nknowledge of mind itself. \n\n\n[O]ur knowledge of mind, like that of matter, is entirely relative\n[\u2026] We have no conception of Mind itself, as distinguished from\nits conscious manifestations. (Examination, IX: 188\u20139)\n\n\n\nWe know our own self, Mill claims, only as it phenomenally appears to\nus\u2014and we know of other selves only by inference from our own\ncase. Mill rejects the \u201ccommon theory of Mind, as a so-called\nsubstance\u201d (Examination, IX: 206). But he also resists\nthe total reduction of mind to the existence of sensations\u2014or\neven to the existence of possible sensations\u2014on the\ngrounds that there remains a unity to apperception. As he points out,\na reduction of self to sensations cannot be wholly satisfactory,\nbecause a sense of the self enters into many sensations as a\nconstituent part. When I recall a memory, for instance, the sensation\nis of a memory which has as part of its content that it is my\nmemory. \n\n\nIf, therefore, we speak of the Mind as a series of feelings, we are\nobliged to complete the statement by calling it a series of feelings\nwhich is aware of itself as past and future; and we are reduced to the\nalternative of believing that the Mind, or Ego, is something different\nfrom any series of feelings, or possibilities of them, or of accepting\nthe paradox, that something which ex hypothesi is but a\nseries of feelings, can be aware of itself as a series.\n(Examination, 194)\n\n\nOn the surface, Mill\u2019s motivations towards idealism is\nepistemic\u2014that we can never experience unmediated non-mental\nobjects, and so cannot be warranted in believing in their\nexistence. But the argument goes deeper, suggesting that we cannot\neven imagine what it would be to believe in the existence of\nnon-mental objects. \u201c[E]ven an imaginary object is but a\nconception, such as we are able to form, of something which would\naffect our senses\u201d (Examination, IX: 6). Indeed, Mill\nat times suggests a semantic version of the argument, which would\nestablish that the very meaning of our words\u2014determined, as they\nare, by experience\u2014obstructs us from referring to\nanything beyond experience.\n\n\nIt would, no doubt, be absurd to assume that our words exhaust the\npossibilities of Being. There may be innumerable modes of it which are\ninaccessible to our faculties, and which consequently we are unable to\nname. But we ought not to speak of these modes of Being by any of the\nnames we possess. These are all inapplicable, because they all stand\nfor known modes of Being. (Examination, IX: 11)\n\n\nIts bears emphasis that Mill\u2019s argument about the limits of\nhuman cognition does not depend on our current state of scientific\nknowledge\u2014or indeed upon the particular sense faculties we\npossess. Even if we had extra sense faculties or could come to\nperceive in new ways, he notes, all knowledge that would still be\n\u201cmerely phaenomenal\u201d (Examination, IX: 8).\nCognition, in any sentient creature must be mediated by some\nmethod of cognising\u2014and if even if we came to possess new ways\nof cognizing the world, \u201c[w]e should not, any more than at\npresent, know things as they are in themselves\u201d\n(Examination, IX: 8, my emphasis). Indeed, to say even that\n\u201cthe Creator\u201d knows things as they are in themselves is to\ncommit a confusion.\n",
