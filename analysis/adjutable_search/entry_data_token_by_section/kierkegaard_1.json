Kierkegaard\u2019s Analysis of Human Existence: Despair, Social Critique, and Anxiety\n\nKierkegaard does not think of the human self predominantly as a kind\nof metaphysical substance, but rather more like an achievement, a goal\nto strive for. To be sure, humans are substances of a sort; they exist\nin the world, as do physical objects. However, what is distinctive\nabout human selves is that the self must become what it is to become,\nhuman selves playing an active role in the process by which they come\nto define themselves. This idea is familiar from existentialist\nthinkers such as Sartre, and we can thereby understand why Kierkegaard\nis often described as the \u201cfather of existentialism\u201d\n(however unhelpful that label may otherwise be). However, as we shall\nsee below, one important difference from Sartre is that for\nKierkegaard the idea of existentialist \u201cself-creation\u201d\n(or, perhaps better, \u201cself-shaping\u201d) needs to be\nsynthesized with \u201cself-acceptance:\u201d a recognition that the\nself is in some sense given by our limitations and certain facts of\nbiology and history (for this terminology, see Rudd 2012).\n\nKierkegaard\u2019s picture of selfhood is perhaps most clearly on\ndisplay in The Sickness Unto Death, one of two works in his\nauthorship described on the title page as \u201cpsychological\u201d.\nAlthough Sickness is attributed to the \u201chigher\u201d\npseudonym Anti-Climacus, much of its account of the structure of the\nhuman self can be found in other Kierkegaardian writings, both signed\nand pseudonymous. Like Hegel, Anti-Climacus holds both that human\nbeings are to be understood as \u201cspirit\u201d, and that spirit\nmust become itself through a process. The major difference is that\nHegel sees spirit as manifested in all of reality and particularly in\nhumanity as a whole, whereas Anti-Climacus focuses on the individual\nhuman self.\n\nPerhaps another similarity to Hegel is that there is a\n\u201cdialectical\u201d character to the human self understood as\nspirit. Becoming spirit is seen as an on-going \u201csynthesis\u201d\nof contrasting fundamental characteristics: the finite and the\ninfinite, the temporal and the eternal; the necessary and the\npossible. Much about the self is fixed and cannot be chosen. Humans\nare born with particular biological characteristics, in a particular\nplace and time, into a world that is not of their own making. However,\nas self-conscious beings, humans still contain possibilities to be\nactualized. The Sickness Unto Death describes various ways in\nwhich humans fail to synthesize these contrasting features and thus\nfall into despair, which is seen not merely as an emotion but as the\nstate in which the self fails to become a self in truth. For instance,\nthe person in the grip of the \u201cdespair of possibility\u201d\nloses contact with necessity and thus lives in a world of imagination\nthat is disconnected from actuality. While such a person recognizes\nthat concrete possibilities must be chosen from a range of options,\nthey misuse their imagination to generate an endless series of\npossibilities, thus postponing (and evading) the need for choice and\naction. The task is somehow to actualize \u201cthe eternal\u201d\n(possibilities) as a temporal being. The person in the \u201cdespair\nof necessity\u201d is on the other hand a fatalist of sorts who,\nhaving lost hope, sees no imaginative possibilities that can be\nincorporated into his or her life. Necessity alone, Anti-Climacus\nclaims, is suffocating. Possibility is, spiritually speaking, like\noxygen: one cannot breathe pure oxygen, but neither can one breathe\nwithout it.\n\nThere is in Kierkegaard\u2019s view of the human self as spirit one\nother fundamental difference from Hegel\u2019s concept of spirit.\nHegel\u2019s dialectic (at least on some interpretations) comes to\nrest when the conflicting moments are reconciled in a final, higher\nunity. For Kierkegaard, however, the human self is fundamentally\ntemporal and (at least prior to death) is always an unfinished\nproject. The task of balancing the elements of human selfhood\n(necessity and possibility, eternity and temporality) so as to avoid\ndespair is never completed short of the grave.\n\nDespite Kierkegaard\u2019s reputation as an\n\u201cindividualist\u201d, he does not see the process of becoming a\nself as one that is carried out by an autonomous, isolated self. As\nself-conscious beings, humans can \u201cstep back\u201d from\nthemselves and \u201crelate themselves to themselves\u201d. However,\nAnti-Climacus insists that the human self cannot \u201crelate itself\nto itself\u201d alone, but always by \u201crelating \u2026 to\nanother\u201d. All of us in some ways live in relation to ideals, but\nthose ideals come from outside the self and provide a basis for\nself-definition. Anti-Climacus clearly thinks that for the human self\nto be healthy, free from the despair that is \u201cthe sickness unto\ndeath\u201d, the \u201cother\u201d who is the basis for the self\nmust be God, who created the self but gave it a kind of freedom by\n\u201creleasing it from his hand, as it were\u201d (SUD 16/SKS 11,\n132). However, both Kierkegaard and Anti-Climacus recognize that in\nreality most human selves are defined by \u201cothers\u201d very\ndifferent from God. We attempt to ground our identities in\n\u201cworldly distinctions\u201d such as riches and fame or define\nourselves by our devotion to abstractions that have the potential to\nbecome idols, such as nation, race or class. On Kierkegaard\u2019s\nview, only when one is defined by a commitment to what is absolute and\ninfinite (God) can one be freed from the constricting labels and\nconformist roles that society attempts to impose on all of us. This is\nparticularly so in a modern society that is shaped by \u201cthe\npress\u201d, and which seeks to \u201clevel\u201d the distinctive\nindividual who dares to be faithful to an individual calling. This\ninfluential critique of modern societies is found in such essays as\nA Literary Review. There, Kierkegaard describes the aspects\nof disengagement mentioned above in connection with certain modes of\nphilosophizing (see further\n \u00a73.1\n below) as part of a broader problem with the culture of his age. He\ncontrasts the passionate \u201cage of revolution\u201d with\n\u201cthe present age\u201d\u2014indolent; excessively reflective;\napathetic; and envy-fueled. Each age has its risks, but one of the\nproblems with the present age is precisely that it is one of\n\u201cleveling\u201d, in which genuine excellence is stifled by the\n\u201cmonstrous abstraction\u201d (TA 90/SKS 8, 86) which\nKierkegaard labels \u201cthe public\u201d, an unaccountable\n\u201cphantom\u201d created by \u201cthe press\u201d and in whose\nname all kinds of injustices are perpetuated. While Kierkegaard was\nsurely influenced here by the \u201cCorsair affair\u201d, his\nanalysis of \u201cthe present age\u201d has often been taken as an\nastute anticipation of concerns later critics have raised about the\nmass media (and, latterly, elements of social media: one might think\nof the \u201calgorithms\u201d of Facebook and Twitter as the kind of\nfaceless, anonymous \u201cphantoms\u201d that Kierkegaard had in\nmind).\n\nAs already noted, Kierkegaard believes that the task of becoming a\nself requires \u201cinwardness\u201d or \u201csubjectivity\u201d,\nand that merely amassing objective knowledge or taking a detached\nperspective on intellectual questions by itself leads one away from\nselfhood. In Concluding Unscientific Postscript Johannes\nClimacus argues that reflection, though a crucial and necessary\nelement in human life, by itself cannot lead to choices (see Evans\n2006: 311\u2013326). In an argument that resembles David Hume\u2019s\nclaim that \u201creason is, and ought only to be the slave of the\npassions\u2026\u201d, (Hume 1739\u201340 [1888: 415]) Climacus\nsays that reflection itself has a kind of inner infinity. A person\nthinking about a decision can always go on thinking and so long as\nthat is happening, cannot decide. What must happen is that the person\nmust desire to make a choice, and thus will to stop the process of\nreflection by identifying with a possibility to be actualized.\n\nPrior to the analysis of despair given in The Sickness Unto\nDeath, Kierkegaard\u2019s pseudonym Vigilius Haufniensis (a\nLatinized version of \u201cThe Watchman of Copenhagen\u201d)\nprovided an influential treatment of another significant human\npsychological state in The Concept of Anxiety. On the surface\nthis book is an inquiry into the nature of original or\n\u201chereditary\u201d sin, but in reality it probes the nature of\nhuman choice in general, particularly the origins of evil. While\nHaufniensis claims that evil or sin cannot be scientifically explained\nbecause it has its origins in freedom, he nonetheless believes that\nanxiety helps us to understand how sin is possible. Anxiety is not\nmerely a pathological condition which is a symptom of disease, but\npart of the human condition itself. It is an awareness of freedom.\nWhen we are anxious, we feel a \u201csympathetic antipathy\u201d or\nan \u201cantipathetic sympathy\u201d (CA 42/SKS 4, 348) in which we\nare both drawn towards and repelled by some possibility. How exactly\nfreedom comes to be misused is not made altogether clear by\nHaufniensis, who says that\n\n\nanxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit\nwants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own\npossibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. (CA 61/ SKS\n4, 365)\n\n\nThis \u201clooking down\u201d produces anxiety, which is the state\nthat precedes sin, though Haufniensis is clear that a morally free\naction always comes from a \u201cleap\u201d and cannot be seen as\nnecessary (CA 48\u201351/SKS 4, 353\u20137). Perhaps the best\nscholarly treatment of these matters is found in Michelle Kosch\n(2006), who convincingly argues that Kierkegaard is responding to\nKant-inspired debates about human freedom and autonomy in Fichte and\nSchelling, and usefully shows the relevance of Kierkegaard\u2019s\nviews to contemporary debates about the human will. Haufniensis does\nclaim that when freedom is misused, anxiety takes on a pathological\ncharacter, but the cure is not the total elimination of anxiety.\nRather, what is crucial is to learn to be anxious properly:\n\u201cWhoever has learned to be anxious in the right way has learned\nthe ultimate\u201d (CA 155; SKS 4, 454).\n",
