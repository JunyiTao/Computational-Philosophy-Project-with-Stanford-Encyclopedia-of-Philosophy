    "main_text": "Turing (1950) and Responses to Objections || Argument from Continuity of the Nervous System\n2.7 Argument from Continuity of the Nervous System\n\nThe human brain and nervous system is not much like a digital\ncomputer. In particular, there are reasons for being skeptical of the\nclaim that the brain is a discrete-state machine. Turing observes that\na small error in the information about the size of a nervous impulse\nimpinging on a neuron may make a large difference to the size of the\noutgoing impulse. From this, Turing infers that the brain is likely to\nbe a continuous-state machine; and he then notes that, since\ndiscrete-state machines are not continuous-state machines, there might\nbe reason here for thinking that no discrete-state machine can be\nintelligent.\n\nTuring\u2019s response to this kind of argument seems to be that a\ncontinuous-state machine can be imitated by discrete-state machines\nwith very small levels of error. Just as differential analyzers can be\nimitated by digital computers to within quite small margins of error,\nso too, the conversation of human beings can be imitated by digital\ncomputers to margins of error that would not be detected by ordinary\ninterrogators playing the imitation game. It is not clear that this is\nthe right kind of response for Turing to make. If someone thinks that\nreal thought (or intelligence, or mind, or whatever) can only be\nlocated in a continuous-state machine, then the fact\u2014if, indeed,\nit is a fact\u2014that it is possible for discrete-state machines to\npass the Turing Test shows only that the Turing Test is no good. A\nbetter reply is to ask why one should be so confident that real\nthought, etc. can only be located in continuous-state machines (if,\nindeed, it is right to suppose that we are not discrete-state\nmachines). And, before we ask this question, we would do well to\nconsider whether we really do have such good reason to suppose that,\nfrom the standpoint of our ability to think, we are not essentially\ndiscrete-state machines. (As Block (1981) points out, it seems that\nthere is nothing in our concept of intelligence that rules out\nintelligent beings with quantised sensory devices; and nor is there\nanything in our concept of intelligence that rules out intelligent\nbeings with digital working parts.)\n",
