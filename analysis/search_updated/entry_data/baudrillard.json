    "preamble": "\n\n\nAssociated with postmodern and poststructuralist theory, Jean\nBaudrillard (1929\u20132007) is difficult to situate in relation to\ntraditional and contemporary philosophy. His work combines philosophy,\nsocial theory, and an idiosyncratic cultural metaphysics that reflects\non key events and phenomena of the epoch. A sharp critic of\ncontemporary society, culture, and thought, Baudrillard is often seen\nas a major guru of French postmodern theory, although he can also be\nread as a thinker who combines social and cultural criticism in\noriginal and provocative ways and a writer who has developed his own\nstyle and forms of writing. He was an extremely prolific author who has\npublished over fifty books and commented on some of the most salient\ncultural and sociological phenomena of the contemporary era, including\nthe erasure of the distinctions of gender, race, and class that\nstructured modern societies in a new postmodern consumer, media, and\nhigh tech society; the mutating roles of art and aesthetics;\nfundamental changes in politics, culture, and human beings; and the\nimpact of new media, information, and cybernetic technologies in the\ncreation of a qualitatively different social order, providing\nfundamental mutations of human and social life.\n\n\nFor some years a cult figure of postmodern theory, Baudrillard moved\nbeyond the postmodern discourse from the early 1980s to his death in\n2007, and in his later writings developed a highly idiosyncratic mode\nof philosophical and cultural analysis. This entry focuses on the\ndevelopment of Baudrillard\u2019s unique modes of thought and how he\nmoved from social theory to postmodern theory to a provocative type of\nphilosophical\n analysis.[1]\nIn\nretrospect, Baudrillard can be seen a theorist who has traced in\noriginal ways the life of signs and impact of technology on social\nlife, and who has systematically criticized major modes of modern\nthought, while developing his own philosophical perspectives.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Early Writings: From the System of Objects to The Mirror of Production\n\n\nJean Baudrillard was born in the cathedral town of Reims, France in\n1929. He told interviewers that his grandparents were peasants and his\nparents became civil servants (Gane 1993: 19). Baudrillard also claims\nthat he was the first member of his family to pursue an advanced\neducation and that this led to a rupture with his parents and cultural\nmilieu. In 1956, he began working as a professor of secondary education\nin a French high school (Lyce\u00e9) and in the early 1960s did\neditorial work for the French publisher Seuil. Baudrillard was\ninitially a Germanist who published essays on literature in Les\ntemps modernes in 1962\u20131963 and translated works of Peter Weiss\nand Bertolt Brecht into French, as well as a book on messianic\nrevolutionary movements by Wilhelm M\u00fchlmann. During this period,\nhe met and studied the works of Henri Lefebvre, whose critiques of\neveryday life impressed him, and Roland Barthes, whose semiological\nanalyses of contemporary society had lasting influence on his work.\n\n\nIn 1966, Baudrillard entered the University of Paris, Nanterre, and\nbecame Lefebvre\u2019s assistant, while studying languages,\nphilosophy, sociology, and other disciplines. He defended his\n\u201cThese de Troisi\u00e8me Cycle\u201d in sociology at Nanterre\nin 1966 with a dissertation on \u201cLe syst\u00e8me des\nobjects,\u201d and began teaching sociology in October of that year.\nOpposing French and U.S. intervention in the Algerian and Vietnamese\nwars, Baudrillard associated himself with the French Left in the 1960s.\nNanterre was a key site of radical politics and the \u201cMarch 22\nmovement,\u201d associated with Daniel Cohn-Bendit and the\nenrag\u00e9s, began in the Nanterre sociology department.\nBaudrillard said later that he participated in the events of May 1968\nthat resulted in massive student uprisings and a general strike that\nalmost drove de Gaulle from power.\n\n\nDuring the late 1960s, Baudrillard published a series of books that\nwould eventually make him world famous. Influenced by Lefebvre,\nBarthes, and a series of French thinkers whose influence will be\ndiscussed below, Baudrillard undertook serious work in the field of\nsocial theory, semiology, and psychoanalysis in the 1960s and published\nhis first book The System of Objects in 1968 (1996), followed\nby a book on The Consumer Society in 1970 (1998), and For\na Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign in\n1972\n (1981).[2]\nThese early\npublications are attempts, within the framework of critical sociology,\nto combine the studies of everyday life initiated by Lefebvre (1971 and\n1991 [1947]) with a social semiology that studies the life of signs in\nsocial life. This project, influenced by Barthes (1967 [1964], 1972\n[1958], and 1983 [1967]), centers on the system of objects in the\nconsumer society (the focus of his first two books), and the interface\nbetween political economy and semiotics (the nucleus of his\nthird\n book).[3]\nBaudrillard\u2019s\nearly work was one of the first to appropriate semiology to analyze how\nobjects are encoded with a system of signs and meanings that constitute\ncontemporary media and consumer societies. Combining semiological\nstudies, Marxian political economy, and sociology of the consumer\nsociety, Baudrillard began his life-long task of exploring the system\nof objects and signs which forms our everyday life.\n\n\nThe early Baudrillard described the meanings invested in the objects\nof everyday life (e.g., the power accrued through identification with\none\u2019s automobile when driving) and the structural system through\nwhich objects were organized into a new modern society (e.g., the\nprestige or sign-value of a new sports car). In his first\nthree books, Baudrillard maintained that the classical Marxian critique\nof political economy needed to be supplemented by semiological theories\nof the sign which articulated the diverse meanings signified by\nsignifiers into languages organized into systems of meaning.\nBaudrillard, following Barthes and others, argued that fashion, sports,\nthe media, and other modes of signification produced systems of meaning\narticulated by specific rules, codes, and logics (terms used somewhat\ninterchangeably by Baudrillard which are elucidated in more detail\nbelow).\n\n\nSituating his analysis of signs, language, and everyday life in a\nhistorical framework, Baudrillard argued that the transition from the\nearlier stage of competitive market capitalism to the stage of monopoly\ncapitalism required increased attention to demand management, to\naugmenting and steering consumption. At this historical stage, from\naround 1920 to the 1960s, the need to intensify demand supplemented\nconcern with lowering production costs and with expanding production.\nIn this era of capitalist development, economic concentration, new\nproduction techniques, and the development of new technologies,\naccelerated capacity for mass production and capitalist corporations\nfocused increased attention on managing consumption and creating needs\nfor new prestigious goods, thus producing the regime of what\nBaudrillard has called sign-value.\n\n\nOn Baudrillard\u2019s analysis, advertising, packaging, display,\nfashion, \u201cemancipated\u201d sexuality, mass media and culture,\nand the proliferation of commodities multiplied the quantity of signs\nand spectacles, and produced a proliferation of sign-value. Henceforth,\nBaudrillard claims, commodities are not merely to be characterized by\nuse-value and exchange value, as in Marx\u2019s theory of the\ncommodity, but sign-value \u2014 the expression and mark of style,\nprestige, luxury, power, and so on \u2014 becomes an increasingly\nimportant part of the commodity and consumption (see Goldman and Papson\n1996).\n\n\nFrom this perspective, Baudrillard claims that commodities are\nbought and displayed as much for their sign-value as their use-value,\nand that the phenomenon of sign-value has become an essential\nconstituent of the commodity and consumption in the consumer society.\nThis position was influenced by Veblen\u2019s notion of\n\u201cconspicuous consumption\u201d and display of commodities\nanalyzed in his Theory of the Leisure Class that Baudrillard\nargued has become extended to everyone in the consumer society. For\nBaudrillard, the entire society is organized around consumption and\ndisplay of commodities through which individuals gain prestige,\nidentity, and standing. In this system, the more prestigious\none\u2019s commodities (houses, cars, clothes, and so on), the higher\none\u2019s standing in the realm of sign value. Thus, just as words\ntake on meaning according to their position in a differential system of\nlanguage, so sign values take on meaning according to their place in a\ndifferential system of prestige and status.\n\n\nIn The Consumer Society, Baudrillard concludes by extolling\n\u201cmultiple forms of refusal\u201d of social convention,\nconspicuous consumption, and conformist thought and behavior, all of\nwhich can be fused in a \u201cpractice of radical change\u201d (1998:\n183). He alludes here to the expectation of \u201cviolent eruptions\nand sudden disintegration which will come, just as unforeseeably and as\ncertainly May 68, to wreck this white mass\u201d [of consumption]\n(1998: 196). On the other hand, Baudrillard also describes a situation\nwhere alienation is so total that it cannot be surpassed because\n\u201cit is the very structure of market society\u201d (1998: 190).\nHis argument is that in a society where everything is a commodity that\ncan be bought and sold, alienation is total. Indeed, the term\n\u201calienation\u201d originally signified \u201cto sale,\u201d\nand in a totally commodified society, alienation is ubiquitous.\nMoreover, Baudrillard posits \u201cthe end of transcendence\u201d (a\nphrase borrowed from Marcuse) where individuals can neither perceive\ntheir own true needs or another way of life (1998: 190ff).\n\nBaudrillard and Neo-Marxism\n\n\nBy 1970, Baudrillard has distinguished himself from the Marxist\ntheory of revolution and instead postulates only the possibility of\nrevolt against the consumer society in an \u201cunforeseeable but\ncertain\u201d form. In the late 1960s, he had associated himself with\na group of intellectuals around the journal Utopie which\nsought to overcome disciplinary boundaries and in the spirit of Guy\nDebord and the Situationist International to combine reflections on\nalternative societies, architecture, and modes of\neveryday\n life.[4]\nBringing together\nindividuals on the margins of architecture, city planning, cultural\ncriticism and social theory, Baudrillard and his associates\ndistinguished themselves from other political and theoretical groupings\nand developed idiosyncratic and marginal discourse beyond the\nboundaries of established disciplines and political tendencies. This\naffiliation with Utopie only lasted into the early 1970s, but\nit may have helped produce in him a desire to work on the margins, to\nstand aside from current trends and fads, and to develop his own\ntheoretical positions. His articles from this project have been\ncollected in English translation in Utopia Deferred\n(2006a).\n\n\nBaudrillard thus had an ambivalent relation to classical Marxism by\nthe early 1970s. On one hand, he carried forward the Marxian critique\nof commodity production which delineates and criticizes various forms\nof alienation, domination, and exploitation produced by capitalism. At\nthis stage, it appeared that his critique takes place from the standard\nneo-Marxian vantage point which assumes that capitalism is blameworthy\nbecause it is homogenizing, controlling and dominating social life,\nwhile robbing individuals of their freedom, creativity, time and human\npotentialities. On the other hand, he cannot point to any revolutionary\nforces and in particular did not discuss the situation and potential of\nthe working class as an agent of change in the consumer society.\nIndeed, Baudrillard has no theory of the subject as an active agent of\nsocial change whatsoever, thus following the structuralist and\npoststructuralist critique of the philosophical and practical subject\ncategorized by Descartes, Kant, and Sartre which was long dominant in\nFrench thought. Structuralists and poststructuralists argued that\nsubjectivity was produced by language, social institutions, and\ncultural forms and was not independent of its construction in these\ninstitutions and practices.\n\n\nNor does Baudrillard develop a theory of class or group revolt, or\nany theory of political organization, struggle, or strategy of the sort\nfrequent in post-1960s France. Yet Baudrillard\u2019s work here is\nparticularly close to the work of the Frankfurt school, especially that\nof Herbert Marcuse, who had already developed some of the first Marxist\ncritiques of the consumer society (see Kellner 1984 and 1989b). Like\nLuk\u00e0cs (1971) and the Frankfurt School, Baudrillard analyzes how\nthe commodity and commodification permeate social life and come to\ndominate individual thought and behavior. Following the general line of\ncritical Marxism, Baudrillard argues that the process of social\nhomogenization, alienation, and exploitation constitutes a process of\nreification in commodities, technologies, and things (i.e.,\n\u201cobjects\u201d) come to dominate people (\u201csubjects\u201d)\ndivesting them of their human qualities and capacities.\n\n\nFor Luk\u00e0cs, the Frankfurt School, and Baudrillard,\nreification \u2014 the process whereby human beings become\ndominated by things and become more thinglike themselves \u2014 comes\nto govern social life. Conditions of labor imposed submission and\nstandardization on human life, as well as exploiting workers and\nalienating them from a life of freedom and self-determination. In a\nmedia and consumer society, culture and consumption also became\nhomogenized, depriving individuals of the possibility of cultivating\nindividuality and self-determination.\n\n\nIn a sense, Baudrillard\u2019s work can be read as an account of a\nfurther stage of reification and social domination than that described\nby the Frankfurt School who described how individuals were controlled\nby ruling institutions and modes of thought. Baudrillard goes beyond\nthe Frankfurt School by applying the semiological theory of the sign to\ndescribe how commodities, media, and technologies provide a universe of\nillusion and fantasy in which individuals become overpowered by\nconsumer values, media ideologies and role models, and seductive\ntechnologies like computers which provide worlds of cyberspace.\nEventually, he will take his analysis of domination by signs and the\nsystem of objects to even more pessimistic conclusions where he\nconcludes that the thematic of the \u201cend of the individual\u201d\nsketched by the Frankfurt School has reached its fruition in the total\ndefeat of human subjectivity by the object world (see\n Section 3).\n\n\nYet in some writings, Baudrillard has a somewhat more active theory\nof consumption than that of the Frankfurt School\u2019s that generally\nportrays consumption as a passive mode of social integration. By\ncontrast, consumption in Baudrillard\u2019s early writings is itself a\nkind of labor, \u201can active manipulation of signs,\u201d a way of\ninserting oneself within the consumer society, and working to\ndifferentiate oneself from others. Yet this active manipulation of\nsigns is not equivalent to postulating an active human subject that\ncould resist, redefine, or produce its own signs, thus Baudrillard\nfails to develop a genuine theory of agency.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s first three works can thus be read in the\nframework of a neo-Marxian critique of capitalist societies. One could\nread Baudrillard\u2019s emphasis on consumption as a supplement to\nMarx\u2019s analysis of production and his focus on culture and signs\nas an important supplement to classical Marxian political economy,\nwhich adds a cultural and semiological dimension to the Marxian\nproject. But in his 1973 provocation, The Mirror of Production\n(translated into English in 1975), Baudrillard carries out a systematic\nattack on classical Marxism, claiming that Marxism is but a mirror of\nbourgeois society, placing production at the center of life, thus\nnaturalizing the capitalist organization of society.\n\n\nAlthough in the 1960s, Baudrillard participated in the tumultuous\nevents of May 1968, and was associated with the revolutionary Left and\nMarxism, he broke with Marxism in the early 1970s, but remained\npolitically radical though unaffiliated the rest of the decade. Like\nmany on the Left, Baudrillard was disappointed that the French\nCommunist Party did not support the radical \u201860s movements and he\nalso distrusted the official Marxism of theorists like Louis Althusser\nwho he found dogmatic and reductive. Consequently, Baudrillard began a\nradical critique of Marxism, one that would be repeated by many of his\ncontemporaries who would also take a postmodern turn (see Best and\nKellner 1991 and 1997).\n\n\nBaudrillard (1975) argues that Marxism, first, does not adequately\nilluminate premodern societies that were organized around religion,\nmythology, and tribal organization and not production. He also argues\nthat Marxism does not provide a sufficiently radical critique of\ncapitalist societies and alternative critical discourses and\nperspectives. At this stage, Baudrillard turns to anthropological\nperspectives on premodern societies for hints of more emancipatory\nalternatives. Yet it is important to note that this critique of Marxism\nwas taken from the Left, arguing that Marxism did not provide a radical\nenough critique of, or alternative to, contemporary capitalist and\ncommunist societies organized around production. Baudrillard concluded\nthat French communist failure to support the May 68 movements was\nrooted in part in a conservatism that had roots in Marxism itself.\nHence, Baudrillard and others of his generation began searching for\nalternative critical positions.\n2. Symbolic Exchange and the Postmodern Break\n\nThe Mirror of Production and his next book Symbolic\nExchange and Death (1976), a major text finally translated in\n1993, are attempts to provide ultraradical perspectives that overcome\nthe limitations of an economistic Marxist tradition that privileges the\neconomic sphere. This ultra-leftist phase of Baudrillard\u2019s\nitinerary would be short-lived, however, though in Symbolic\nExchange and Death, Baudrillard produces one of his most important\nand dramatic provocations. The text opens with a Preface that condenses\nhis attempt to provide a significantly different approach to society\nand culture. Building on the French cultural theory of Georges\nBataille, Marcel Mauss, and Alfred Jarry, he champions \u201csymbolic\nexchange\u201d which resists capitalist values of utility and monetary\nprofit for cultural values. Baudrillard argues that in Bataille\u2019s\nclaim that expenditure and excess is connected with sovereignty,\nMauss\u2019s descriptions of the social prestige of gift-giving in\npremodern society, Jarry\u2019s theater that ridicules French culture,\nand Saussure\u2019s anagrams, there is a break with the values of\ncapitalist exchange and production, or the production of meaning in\nlinguistic exchange. These cases of \u201csymbolic exchange,\u201d\nBaudrillard believes, break with the values of production and describe\npoetic exchange and creative cultural activity that provides\nalternatives to the capitalist values of production and exchange.\n\n\nThe term \u201csymbolic exchange\u201d was derived from Georges\nBataille\u2019s notion of a \u201cgeneral economy\u201d where\nexpenditure, waste, sacrifice, and destruction were claimed to be more\nfundamental to human life than economies of production and utility\n(1988 [1967]). Bataille\u2019s model was the sun that freely expended\nits energy without asking anything in return. He argued that if\nindividuals wanted to be truly sovereign (e.g., free from the\nimperatives of capitalism) they should pursue a \u201cgeneral\neconomy\u201d of expenditure, giving, sacrifice, and destruction to\nescape determination by existing imperatives of utility.\n\n\nFor Bataille, human beings were beings of excess with\nexorbitant energy, fantasies, drives, needs, and heterogeneous desire.\nAt this point, Baudrillard presupposes the truth of Bataille\u2019s\nanthropology and general economy. In a 1976 review of a volume of\nBataille\u2019s Complete Works, Baudrillard writes:\n\u201cThe central idea is that the economy which governs our societies\nresults from a misappropriation of the fundamental human principle,\nwhich is a solar principle of expenditure\u201d (1987: 57). In the\nearly 1970s, Baudrillard took over Bataille\u2019s anthropological\nposition and what he calls Bataille\u2019s \u201caristocratic\ncritique\u201d of capitalism that he now claims is grounded in the\ncrass notions of utility and savings rather than the more sublime\n\u201caristocratic\u201d notion of excess and expenditure. Bataille\nand Baudrillard presuppose here a contradiction between human nature\nand capitalism. They maintain that humans \u201cby nature\u201d gain\npleasure from such things as expenditure, waste, festivities,\nsacrifices, and so on, in which they are sovereign and free to expend\nthe excesses of their energy (and thus to follow their \u201creal\nnature\u201d). The capitalist imperatives of labor, utility, and\nsavings by implication are \u201cunnatural,\u201d and go against\nhuman nature.\n\n\nBaudrillard argues that the Marxian critique of capitalism, by\ncontrast, merely attacks exchange value while exalting use value and\nthus utility and instrumental rationality, thereby \u201cseeking a\ngood use of the economy.\u201d For Baudrillard:\n\n\n\nMarxism is therefore only a limited petit bourgeois critique, one\nmore step in the banalization of life toward the \u2018good use\u2019\nof the social! Bataille, to the contrary, sweeps away all this slave\ndialectic from an aristocratic point of view, that of the master\nstruggling with his death. One can accuse this perspective of being\npre- or post-Marxist. At any rate, Marxism is only the disenchanted\nhorizon of capital \u2014 all that precedes or follows it is more\nradical than it is (1987: 60).\n\n\n\nThis passage is highly revealing and marks Baudrillard\u2019s\nswitch to an \u201caristocratic critique\u201d of political economy\ndeeply influenced by Bataille and Nietzsche. For Bataille and\nBaudrillard are presenting a version of Nietzsche\u2019s aristocratic\n\u201cmaster morality\u201d where \u201csuperior\u201d individuals\ncreate their own values and their life articulates an excess, overflow,\nand intensification of creative and erotic energies. Nietzsche was a\nmajor\n influence[5]\nthroughout\nBaudrillard\u2019s life and, especially in the last decades of his\nwork, Nietzschean motifs, modes of thought, and writing practices\nincreasingly informed his work. Baudrillard became increasingly radical\nand \u201cun-contemporary,\u201d standing alone against current\ntrends and fashions, in a fiercely individualistic mode of thought.\nNietzschean categories like fate, reversal, uncertainty, and an\naristocratic assault on conventional wisdom began to shape his\nwritings, that often, a la Nietzsche, took the form of aphorisms or\nshort essays.\n\n\nFor some time, Baudrillard would continue to attack the bourgeoisie,\ncapital, and political economy, but from a perspective which champions\n\u201caristocratic\u201d expenditure and sumptuary, aesthetic and\nsymbolic values. The dark side of his switch in theoretical and\npolitical allegiances is a valorization of (i.e., a giving or\nassigning of value to) sacrifice and death that informs Symbolic\nExchange and Death (in which sacrifice provides a giving that\nsubverts bourgeois values of utility and self-preservation, an idea\nthat has sinister implications in an era of suicide bombings and\nterrorism).\n\n\nOn the whole, in his mid-1970s work, Baudrillard was extricating\nhimself from the familiar Marxian universe of production and class\nstruggle into a quite different neo-aristocratic and metaphysical\nworld-view. Baudrillard seems to assume at this point that\npre-capitalist societies were governed by forms of symbolic exchange\nsimilar to Bataille\u2019s notion of a general economy. Influenced by\nMauss\u2019 theory of the gift and countergift, Baudrillard claimed\nthat pre-capitalist societies were governed by laws of symbolic\nexchange rather than production and utility. Developing these ideas,\nBaudrillard sketched a fundamental dividing line in history between\nsymbolic societies \u2014 i.e., societies fundamentally organized\naround premodern exchange \u2014 and productivist societies (i.e.,\nsocieties organized around production and commodity exchange). He thus\nrejects the Marxian philosophy of history which posits the primacy of\nproduction in all societies and rejects the Marxian concept of\nsocialism, arguing that it does not break radically enough with\ncapitalist productivism, offering itself merely as a more efficient and\nequitable organization of production rather than as a completely\ndifferent sort of society with a different values and forms of culture\nand life.\n\n\nHenceforth, Baudrillard would contrast \u2014 in one way or another\n\u2014 his ideal of symbolic exchange to the values of production,\nutility, and instrumental rationality that govern capitalist (and\nsocialist) societies. \u201cSymbolic exchange\u201d thus emerges as\nBaudrillard\u2019s \u201crevolutionary\u201d alternative to the\nvalues and practices of capitalist society, and stands for a variety of\nheterogeneous activities in his 1970s writings. For instance, he writes\nin the Critique: \u201cThe exchange of looks, the present\nwhich comes and goes, are like the air people breathe in and out. This\nis the metabolism of exchange, prodigality, festival \u2014 and also\nof destruction (which returns to non-value what production has erected,\nvalorized). In this domain, value isn\u2019t even recognized\u201d\n(1981: 207). He also describes his conception of symbolic exchange in\nThe Mirror of Production where he writes: \u201cThe symbolic\nsocial relation is the uninterrupted cycle of giving and receiving,\nwhich, in primitive exchange, includes the consumption of the\n\u2018surplus\u2019 and deliberate anti-production\u201d (1975:\n143). The term therefore refers to symbolic or cultural activities\nwhich do not contribute to capitalist production and accumulation and\nwhich potentially constitute a \u201cradical negation\u201d of\nproductivist society.\n\n\nAt this stage of his thought, Baudrillard stood in a French\ntradition of extolling \u201cprimitive\u201d or premodern culture\nover the abstract rationalism and utilitarianism of modern society. His\ndefense of symbolic exchange over production and instrumental\nrationality thus stands in the tradition of Rousseau\u2019s defense of\nthe \u201cnatural savage\u201d over modern man, Durkheim\u2019s\nposing mechanical solidarities of premodern societies against the\nabstract individualism and anomie of modern ones, Bataille\u2019s\nvalorization of expenditure of premodern societies, or Mauss\u2019 or\nLevi-Strauss\u2019 fascination with the richness of \u201cprimitive\nsocieties\u201d or \u201cthe savage mind.\u201d After deconstructing\nthe modern master thinkers and his own theoretical fathers (Marx,\nFreud, Saussure, and his French contemporaries) for missing the\nrichness of symbolic exchange, Baudrillard continues to champion the\nsymbolic and radical forms of thought and writing in a quest that takes\nhim into ever more esoteric and exotic discourse.\n\n\nThus, against the organizing forms of modern thought and society,\nBaudrillard champions symbolic exchange as an alternative. Against\nmodern demands to produce value and meaning, he calls for their\nextermination and annihilation, providing as examples, Mauss\u2019s\ngift-exchange, Saussure\u2019s anagrams, and Freud\u2019s concept of\nthe death drive. In all of these instances, there is a rupture with the\nforms of exchange (of goods, meanings, and libidinal energies) and thus\nan escape from the forms of production, capitalism, rationality, and\nmeaning. Baudrillard\u2019s paradoxical concept of symbolic exchange\ncan be explained as expression of a desire to liberate himself from\nmodern positions and to seek a revolutionary position outside of modern\nsociety. Against modern values, he advocates their annihilation and\nextermination.\n\n\nIn 1970s like Baudrillard posits another divide in history as\nradical as the rupture between premodern symbolic societies and modern\nones. In the mode of classical social theory, he systematically\ndevelops distinctions between premodern societies organized around\nsymbolic exchange, modern societies organized around production, and\npostmodern societies organized around \u201csimulation\u201d by which\nhe means the cultural modes of representation that\n\u201csimulate\u201d reality as in television, computer cyberspace,\nand virtual reality. Baudrillard\u2019s distinction between the mode\nof production and utility that organized modern societies and the mode\nof simulation that he believes is the organizing form of postmodern\nsocieties postulates a rupture between modern and postmodern societies\nas great as the divide between modern and premodern ones. In theorizing\nthe epochal postmodern rupture with modernity, he declares the\n\u201cend of political economy\u201d and of an era in which\nproduction was the organizing form of society. Following Marx, he\nargues that this modern epoch was the era of capitalism and the\nbourgeoisie, in which workers were exploited by capital and provided a\nrevolutionary force of upheaval. Baudrillard, however, declared the end\nof political economy and thus the end of the Marxist problematic and of\nmodernity itself:\n\n\n\nThe end of labor. The end of production. The end of political\neconomy. The end of the signifier/signified dialectic which facilitates\nthe accumulation of knowledge and of meaning, the linear syntagma of\ncumulative discourse. And at the same time, the end simultaneously of\nthe exchange value/use value dialectic which is the only thing that\nmakes accumulation and social production possible. The end of linear\ndimension of discourse. The end of the linear dimension of the\ncommodity. The end of the classical era of the sign. The end of the era\nof production (Baudrillard 1993a: 8).\n\n\n\nThe discourse of \u201cthe end\u201d signifies his announcing a\npostmodern break or rupture in history. People are now, Baudrillard\nclaims, in a new era of simulation in which social reproduction\n(information processing, communication, and knowledge industries, and\nso on) replaces production as the organizing form of society. In this\nera, labor is no longer a force of production but is itself a\n\u201cone sign amongst many\u201d (1993a: 10). Labor is not\nprimarily productive in this situation, but is a sign of one\u2019s\nsocial position, way of life, and mode of servitude. Wages too bear no\nrational relation to one\u2019s work and what one produces but to\none\u2019s place within the system (1993a: 19ff.). But, crucially,\npolitical economy is no longer the foundation, the social determinant,\nor even a structural \u201creality\u201d in which other phenomena can\nbe interpreted and explained (31ff.). Instead people live in the\n\u201chyperreality\u201d of simulations in which images, spectacles,\nand the play of signs replace the concepts of production and class\nconflict as key constituents of contemporary societies.\n\n\nFrom now on, capital and political economy disappear from\nBaudrillard\u2019s story, or return in radically new forms.\nHenceforth, signs and codes proliferate and produce other signs and new\nsign machines in ever-expanding and spiraling cycles. Technology thus\nreplaces capital in this story and semiurgy (interpreted by Baudrillard\nas proliferation of images, information, and signs) replaces\nproduction. His postmodern turn is thus connected to a form of\ntechnological determinism and a rejection of political economy as a\nuseful explanatory principle \u2014 a move that many of his critics\nreject (see Kellner 1989, Norris 1992, and the studies in Kellner\n1994).\n\nSymbolic Exchange and Death and the succeeding studies in\nSimulation and Simulacra (1994 [1981]) articulate the\nprinciple of a fundamental rupture between modern and postmodern\nsocieties and mark Baudrillard\u2019s departure from the problematic\nof modern social theory. For him, modern societies are organized around\nthe production and consumption of commodities, while postmodern\nsocieties are organized around simulation and the play of\nimages and signs, denoting a situation in which codes, models, and\nsigns are the organizing forms of a new social order where\nsimulation\n rules.[6]\nIn the society of\nsimulation, identities are constructed by the appropriation of images,\nand codes and models determine how individuals perceive themselves and\nrelate to other people. Economics, politics, social life, and culture\nare all governed by the mode of simulation, whereby codes and models\ndetermine how goods are consumed and used, politics unfold, culture is\nproduced and consumed, and everyday life is lived.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s postmodern world is also one in which previously\nimportant boundaries and distinctions \u2014 such as those between\nsocial classes, genders, political leanings, and once autonomous realms\nof society and culture \u2014 lose power. If modern societies, for\nclassical social theory, were characterized by differentiation, for\nBaudrillard, postmodern societies are characterized by\ndedifferentiation, the \u201ccollapse\u201d of (the power of)\ndistinctions, or implosion. In his society of simulation, the\nrealms of economics, politics, culture, sexuality, and the social all\nimplode into each other. In this implosive mix, economics is\nfundamentally shaped by culture, politics, and other spheres, while\nart, once a sphere of potential difference and opposition, is absorbed\ninto the economic and political, while sexuality is everywhere. In this\nsituation, differences between individuals and groups implode in a\nrapidly mutating or changing dissolution of the social and the previous\nboundaries and structures upon which social theory had once\nfocused.\n\n\nIn addition, his postmodern universe is one of hyperreality\nin which entertainment, information, and communication technologies\nprovide experiences more intense and involving than the scenes of banal\neveryday life, as well as the codes and models that structure everyday\nlife. The realm of the hyperreal (e.g., media simulations of reality,\nDisneyland and amusement parks, malls and consumer fantasylands, TV\nsports, virtual reality games, social networking sites, and other\nexcursions into ideal worlds) is more real than real, whereby the\nmodels, images, and codes of the hyperreal come to control thought and\nbehavior. Yet determination itself is aleatory in a non-linear world\nwhere it is impossible to chart causal mechanisms in a situation in\nwhich individuals are confronted with an overwhelming flux of images,\ncodes, and models, any of which may shape an individual\u2019s thought\nor behavior.\n\n\nIn this postmodern world, individuals flee from the \u201cdesert of\nthe real\u201d for the ecstasies of hyperreality and the new realm of\ncomputer, media, and technological experience. In this universe,\nsubjectivities are fragmented and lost, and a new terrain of experience\nappears that for Baudrillard renders previous social theories and\npolitics obsolete and irrelevant. Tracing the vicissitudes of the\nsubject in present-day society, Baudrillard claims that contemporary\nsubjects are no longer afflicted with modern pathologies like hysteria\nor paranoia. Rather, they exist in \u201ca state of terror which is\ncharacteristic of the schizophrenic, an over-proximity of all things, a\nfoul promiscuity of all things which beleaguer and penetrate him,\nmeeting with no resistance, and no halo, no aura, not even the aura of\nhis own body protects him. In spite of himself the schizophrenic is\nopen to everything and lives in the most extreme confusion\u201d\n(1988: 27). For Baudrillard, the \u201cecstasy of communication\u201d\nmeans that the subject is in close proximity to instantaneous images\nand information, in an overexposed and transparent world. In this\nsituation, the subject \u201cbecomes a pure screen a pure absorption\nand re-absorption surface of the influent networks\u201d (1988: 27).\nIn other words, an individual in a postmodern world becomes merely an\nentity influenced by media, technological experience, and the\nhyperreal.\n\n\nThus, Baudrillard\u2019s categories of simulation, implosion, and\nhyperreality combine to create an emergent postmodern condition that\nrequires entirely new modes of theory and politics to chart and respond\nto the novelties of the contemporary era. His style and writing\nstrategies are also implosive (i.e., working against previously\nimportant distinctions), combining material from strikingly different\nfields, studded with examples from the mass media and popular culture\nin an innovative mode of postmodern theory that does not respect\ndisciplinary boundaries. His writing attempts to itself simulate the\nnew conditions, capturing its novelties through inventive use of\nlanguage and theory. Such radical questioning of contemporary theory\nand the need for new theoretical strategies are thus legitimated for\nBaudrillard by the large extent of changes in the current era.\n\n\nFor instance, Baudrillard claims that modernity operates with a mode\nof representation in which ideas represent reality and truth, concepts\nthat are key postulates of modern theory. A postmodern society explodes\nthis epistemology by creating a situation in which subjects lose\ncontact with the real and fragment and dissolve. This situation\nportends the end of modern theory that operated with a subject-object\ndialectic in which the subject was supposed to represent and control\nthe object. In the story of modern philosophy, the philosophic subject\nattempts to discern the nature of reality, to secure grounded\nknowledge, and to apply this knowledge to control and dominate the\nobject (e.g., nature, other people, ideas, and so on). Baudrillard\nfollows here the poststructuralist critique that thought and discourse\ncould no longer be securely anchored in a priori or privileged\nstructures of \u201cthe real.\u201d Reacting against the mode of\nrepresentation in modern theory, French thought, especially some\ndeconstructionists (Rorty\u2019s \u201cstrong textualists\u201d),\nmoved into the play of textuality, of discourse, which allegedly\nreferred only to other texts or discourses in which \u201cthe\nreal\u201d or an \u201coutside\u201d were banished to the realm of\nnostalgia.\n\n\nIn a similar fashion, Baudrillard, a \u201cstrong\nsimulacrist,\u201d claims that in the media and consumer society,\npeople are caught up in the play of images, spectacles, and simulacra,\nthat have less and less relationship to an outside, to an external\n\u201creality,\u201d to such an extent that the very concepts of the\nsocial, political, or even \u201creality\u201d no longer seem to have\nany meaning. And the narcoticized and mesmerized (some of\nBaudrillard\u2019s metaphors) media-saturated consciousness is in such\na state of fascination with image and spectacle that the concept of\nmeaning itself (which depends on stable boundaries, fixed structures,\nshared consensus) dissolves. In this alarming and novel postmodern\nsituation, the referent, the behind and the outside, along with depth,\nessence, and reality all disappear, and with their disappearance, the\npossibility of all potential opposition vanishes as well. As\nsimulations proliferate, they come to refer only to themselves: a\ncarnival of mirrors reflecting images projected from other mirrors onto\nthe omnipresent television and computer screen and the screen of\nconsciousness, which in turn refers the image to its previous\nstorehouse of images also produced by simulatory mirrors. Caught up in\nthe universe of simulations, the \u201cmasses\u201d are \u201cbathed\nin a media massage\u201d without messages or meaning, a mass age where\nclasses disappear, and politics is dead, as are the grand dreams of\ndisalienation, liberation, and revolution.\n\n\nBaudrillard claims that henceforth the masses seek spectacle and not\nmeaning. They implode into a \u201csilent majority,\u201d signifying\n\u201cthe end of the social\u201d (1983b). Baudrillard implies that\nsocial theory loses its very object as meanings, classes, and\ndifference implode into a \u201cblack hole\u201d of\nnon-differentiation. Fixed distinctions between social groupings and\nideologies implode and concrete face-to-face social relations recede as\nindividuals disappear in worlds of simulation \u2014 media, computers,\nvirtual reality itself. Social theory itself thus loses its object, the\nsocial, while radical politics loses its subject and agency.\n\n\nNonetheless, he claims, at this point in his trajectory (i.e., the\nlate 1970s and early 1980s) that refusal of meaning and participation\nby the masses is a form of resistance. Hovering between nostalgia and\nnihilism, Baudrillard at once exterminates modern ideas (e.g., the\nsubject, meaning, truth, reality, society, socialism, and emancipation)\nand affirms a mode of symbolic exchange which appears to manifest a\nnostalgic desire to return to premodern cultural forms. This desperate\nsearch for a genuinely revolutionary alternative was abandoned,\nhowever, by the early 1980s. Henceforth, he develops yet more novel\nperspectives on the contemporary moment, vacillating between sketching\nout alternative modes of thought and behavior and renouncing the quest\nfor political and social change.\n\n\nIn a sense, there is a parodic inversion of historical materialism\nin Baudrillard. In place of Marx\u2019s emphasis on political economy\nand the primacy of the economic, for Baudrillard it is the model, the\nsuperstructure, that generates the real in a situation he refers to as\nthe \u201cend of political economy\u201d (1993a). For Baudrillard,\nsign values predominate over use values and exchange values; the\nmateriality of needs and commodity use-values to serve them disappear\nin Baudrillard\u2019s semiological imaginary, in which signs take\nprecedence over the real and reconstruct human life. Turning the\nMarxist categories against themselves, masses absorb classes, the\nsubject of praxis is fractured, and objects come to rule human beings.\nRevolution is absorbed by the object of critique and technological\nimplosion replaces the socialist revolution in producing a rupture in\nhistory. For Baudrillard, in contrast to Marx, the catastrophe of\nmodernity and eruption of postmodernity is produced by the unfolding of\ntechnological revolution. Consequently, Baudrillard replaces\nMarx\u2019s hard economic and social determinism with its emphasis on\nthe economic dimension, class struggle, and human praxis, with a form\nof semiological idealism and technological determinism where signs and\nobjects come to dominate the subject.\n\n\nBaudrillard thus concludes that the \u201ccatastrophe has\nhappened,\u201d that the destruction of modernity and modern theory\nwhich he noted in the mid-1970s, has been completed by the development\nof capitalist society itself, that modernity has disappeared and a new\nsocial situation has taken its place. Against traditional strategies of\nrebellion and revolution, Baudrillard begins to champion what he calls\n\u201cfatal strategies\u201d that push the values of the system to\nthe extreme in the hopes of collapse or reversal, and eventually adopts\na style of highly ironic metaphysical discourse that renounces\nemancipation and the discourse and hopes of progressive social\ntransformation.\n3. From Pataphysics to Metaphysics and the Triumph of the Object\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s thought from the mid-1970s to his death in 2007\nchallenges theories in a variety of disciplines. During the 1980s, his\nmajor works of the 1970s were translated into many languages and new\nbooks of the 1980s were in turn translated into English and other major\nlanguages in short order. Consequently, he became world-renown as one\nof the most influential thinkers of postmodernity. Baudrillard became\nsomething of an academic celebrity, travelling around the world\npromoting his work and winning a significant following, though more\noutside of the field of academic theory than within his own discipline\nof sociology.\n\n\nAt the same time that his work was becoming extremely popular,\nBaudrillard\u2019s own writing became increasingly difficult and\nobscure. In 1979, he published Seduction (1990), a difficult\ntext that represented a major shift in his thought. The book marks a\nturning away from the more sociological discourse of his earlier works\nto a more philosophical and literary discourse. Whereas in Symbolic\nExchange and Death (1993a [1976]), Baudrillard sketched out\nultra-revolutionary perspectives as a radical alternative, taking\nsymbolic exchange as his ideal, he now takes seduction as his\nalternative to production and communicative interaction. Seduction,\nhowever, does not undermine, subvert, or transform existing social\nrelations or institutions, but is a soft alternative, a play with\nappearances, and a game with feminism, a provocation that provoked a\nsharp critical\n response.[7]\nBaudrillard\u2019s concept of seduction is idiosyncratic and involves\ngames with signs which set up seduction as an aristocratic \u201corder\nof sign and ritual\u201d in contrast to the bourgeois ideal of\nproduction, while advocating artifice, appearance, play, and challenge\nagainst the deadly serious labor of production. He interprets seduction\nprimarily as a ritual and game with its own rules, charms, snares, and\nlures. His writing mutates at this point into a neo-aristocratic\naestheticism dedicated to stylized modes of thought and writing, which\npresent a set of categories \u2014 reversibility, the challenge, the\nduel, \u2014 that move Baudrillard\u2019s thought toward a form of\naristocratic aestheticism and metaphysics.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s proliferating metaphysical speculations are\nevident in Fatal Strategies (1983, translated in 1990),\nanother turning point in his career. This text presented a bizarre\nmetaphysical scenario concerning the triumph of objects over subjects\nwithin the \u201cobscene\u201d proliferation of an object world so\ncompletely out of control that it surpasses all attempts to understand,\nconceptualize and control it. His scenario concerns the proliferation\nand growing supremacy of objects over subjects and the eventual triumph\nof the object. In a discussion of \u201cEcstasy and Inertia,\u201d\nBaudrillard discusses how objects and events in contemporary society\nare continually surpassing themselves, growing and expanding in power.\nThe \u201cecstasy\u201d of objects is their great proliferation and\nexpansion; ecstasy as going outside of or beyond oneself: the beautiful\nas more beautiful than beautiful in fashion, the real more real than\nthe real in television, sex more sexual than sex in pornography.\nEcstasy is thus the form of obscenity (fully explicit, nothing hidden)\nand of the hyperreality described by Baudrillard earlier taken to\nanother level, redoubled and intensified. His vision of contemporary\nsociety exhibits a careening of growth and excrescence\n(croissance et excroissance), expanding and excreting ever\nmore goods, services, information, messages or demands \u2014\nsurpassing all rational ends and boundaries in a spiral of uncontrolled\ngrowth and replication.\n\n\nYet growth, acceleration, and proliferation have reached such\nextremes, Baudrillard suggests, that the ecstasy of excrescence (i.e.,\nincreasing numbers of goods) is accompanied by inertia. The process of\ngrowth presents a catastrophe for the subject, for not only does the\nacceleration and proliferation of the object world intensify the\naleatory dimension of chance and non-determinacy, but the objects\nthemselves come to dominate the exhausted subject, whose fascination\nwith the play of objects turns to apathy, stupefaction, and\ninertia.\n\n\nIn retrospect, the growing power of the world of objects over the\nsubject has been Baudrillard\u2019s theme from the beginning, thus\npointing to an underlying continuity in his project. In his early\nwritings, he explored the ways that commodities were fascinating\nindividuals in the consumer society and the ways that the world of\ngoods was assuming new and more value through the agency of sign value\nand the code \u2014 which were part of the world of things, the system\nof objects. His polemics against Marxism were fuelled by the belief\nthat sign value and the code were more fundamental than such\ntraditional elements of political economy as exchange value, use value,\nproduction and so on in constituting contemporary society. Then,\nreflections on the media entered the forefront of his thought: the TV\nobject was at the center of the home in Baudrillard\u2019s earlier\nthinking and the media, simulations, hyperreality, and implosion\neventually came to obliterate distinctions between private and public,\ninside and outside, media and reality. Henceforth, everything was\npublic, transparent, and hyperreal in the object world that was gaining\nin fascination and seductiveness as the years went by.\n\n\nIn Fatal Strategies and succeeding writings, the object\ndominates or \u201cdefeats\u201d the subject. The \u201cfatal\nstrategies\u201d suggest that individuals should simply submit to the\nstrategies and ruses of objects. In \u201cbanal strategies,\u201d\n\u201cthe subject believes itself to always be more clever than the\nobject, whereas in the other [fatal strategies] the object is always\nsupposed to be more shrewd, more cynical, more brilliant than the\nsubject\u201d (1983: 259\u2013260). Previously, in banal strategies, the\nsubject believed itself to be more masterful and sovereign than the\nobject. A fatal strategy, by contrast, recognizes the supremacy of the\nobject and therefore takes the side of the object and surrenders to its\nstrategies, ruses and rules.\n\n\nIn these works, Baudrillard seems to be taking his theory into the\nrealm of metaphysics, but it is a specific type of metaphysics deeply\ninspired by the pataphysics developed by Alfred Jarry. For Jarry:\n\n\n\npataphysics is the science of the realm beyond metaphysics\u2026\nIt will study the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the\nuniverse supplementary to this one; or, less ambitiously, it will\ndescribe a universe which one can see \u2014 must see perhaps \u2014\ninstead of the traditional one\u2026\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: pataphysics is the science of imaginary solutions, which\nsymbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their\nvirtuality, to their lineaments (Jarry 1963: 131).\n\n\n\nLike the universe in Jarry\u2019s Ubu Roi, The\nGestures and Opinions of Doctor Faustroll (1969), and other\nliterary texts \u2014 as well as in Jarry\u2019s more theoretical\nexplications of pataphysics \u2014 Baudrillard\u2019s is a totally\nabsurd universe where objects rule in mysterious ways, and people and\nevents are governed by absurd and ultimately unknowable\ninterconnections and predestination (The French playwright Eugene\nIonesco is another good source of entry to this universe). Like\nJarry\u2019s pataphysics, Baudrillard\u2019s universe is ruled by\nsurprise, reversal, hallucination, blasphemy, obscenity, and a desire\nto shock and outrage.\n\n\nThus, in view of the growing supremacy of the object, Baudrillard\nwants us to abandon the subject and to side with the object.\nPataphysics aside, it seems that Baudrillard is trying to end the\nphilosophy of subjectivity that has controlled French thought since\nDescartes by going over completely to the other side. Descartes\u2019\nmalin genie, his evil genius, was a ruse of the subject that\ntried to seduce him into accepting what was not clear and distinct, but\nover which he was ultimately able to prevail. Baudrillard\u2019s\n\u201cevil genius\u201d is the object itself which is much worse than\nthe merely epistemological deceptions of the subject faced by Descartes\nand which constitutes a fatal destiny that demands the end of the\nphilosophy of subjectivity. Henceforth, for Baudrillard, people live in\nthe era of the reign of the object.\n4. Into the 1990s: From Immanent Reversal to Impossible Exchange\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Baudrillard posited an \u201cimmanent\nreversal,\u201d a flip-flop or reversed direction of meaning and\neffects, in which things turn into their opposite. Thus, according to\nBaudrillard, the society of production was passing over to simulation\nand seduction; the panoptic and repressive power theorized by Foucault\nwas turning into a cynical and seductive power of the media and\ninformation society; the liberation championed in the 1960s had become\na form of voluntary servitude; sovereignty had passed from the side of\nthe subject to the object; and revolution and emancipation had turned\ninto their opposites, trapping individuals in an order of simulation\nand virtuality. Baudrillard\u2019s concept of \u201cimmanent\nreversal\u201d thus provides a perverse form of Horkheimer and\nAdorno\u2019s \u201cdialectic of Enlightenment\u201d (1972 [1947]),\nwhere everything becomes its opposite. For Adorno and Horkheimer,\nwithin the transformations of organized and hi-tech capitalism, modes\nof Enlightenment become domination, culture becomes culture industry,\ndemocracy becomes a form of mass manipulation, and science and\ntechnology form a crucial part of an apparatus of social\ndomination.\n\n\nBaudrillard follows this concept of reversal and his paradoxical and\nnihilistic metaphysical vision into the 1990s and 2000s where his\nthought becomes ever more hermetic, fragmentary, and difficult. During\nthe decade, Baudrillard continued playing the role of academic and\nmedia superstar, traveling around the world lecturing and performing in\nintellectual events.\n\n\nRetiring from the University of Nanterre in 1987, Baudrillard\nsubsequently functioned as an independent intellectual, dedicating\nhimself to caustic reflections on our contemporary moment and\nphilosophical ruminations that cultivate his distinct and always\nevolving theory. From June 1987 through May 1997, he published\nreflections on events and phenomena of the day in the Paris newspaper\nLiberation, a series of writings collected in Screened\nOut (2002 [2000]) and providing access to a laboratory for ideas\nlater elaborated in his books.\n\n\nDuring the 1990s and until his death, Baudrillard continued to write\nshort journal entries and by 2007 had published five volumes of his\nCool Memories. These texts combine reflections on his travels\nand experiences with development of his (often recycled) ideas and\nperceptions. Baudrillard\u2019s fragmentary diaries often provide\nrevealing insights into his personal life and psychology, as well as\ncapturing experiences and scenes that generate or embody some of his\nideas. While often repetitive, his \u201ccool memory\u201d booklets\nprovide direct access to the man and his ideas, as well as validating\nhim as a global intellectual superstar who travels around the earth and\nwhose every diary notation is worthy of publication and attention.\n\n\nBaudrillard also produced reflections on contemporary issues like\nthe Gulf War, the September 11 terror attacks, that he saw as the only\nreal \u201cevent\u201d of the past decades, globalization, the US\ninvasion of Iraq, and other occurrences of the\n day.[8]\nBaudrillard also continued his metaphysical\nspeculations in works such as The Transparency of Evil (1993\n[1990]), The Illusion of the End (1994b [1992]), The\nPerfect Crime (1996b [1995]), Impossible Exchange (2001\n[1999]), The Intelligence of Evil or the Lucicity Pact (2005),\nand The Conspiracy of Art (2005). These texts continue his\nexcursions into the metaphysics of the object and defeat of the subject\nand ironical engagement with contemporary history and politics.\nBringing together reflections that develop his ideas and/or comment on\ncontemporary events, these texts continue to postulate a break within\nhistory in the space of a postmodern coupure, though\nBaudrillard himself usually distances himself from other versions of\npostmodern\n theory.[9]\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s retirement from a sociology faculty seemed to have\nliberated his philosophical impulses and in addition to his diary\ncollections and occasional forays into engagement of issues of the\nday, Baudrillard turned out a series of increasingly philosophical and\ndensely theoretical texts.  The post-1990 texts continue the\nfragmentary style and use of short essays, aphorisms, stories, and\naper\u00e7us that Baudrillard began deploying in the 1980s and often\nrepeat some of the same ideas and stories. While the books develop the\nquasi-metaphysical perspectives of the 1980s, they also generate some\nnew ideas and positions. They are often entertaining, although they\ncan also be outrageous and scandalous. These writings can be read as a\ncombination of cultivation of original theoretical perspectives along\nwith continual commentary on current social conditions, accompanied by\na running dialogue with Marxism, poststructuralist theory, and other\nforms of contemporary thought. Yet after his fierce and focused\npolemics of the 1970s against competing models of thought,\nBaudrillard\u2019s later dialogues with theory consist mostly of\noccasional asides and recycling of previous ideas, a retro-theory that\nperhaps ironically illustrates his theses about the decline of theory\nand politics in the contemporary moment.\n\n\nIn The Transparency of Evil (1993), Baudrillard described a\nsituation in which previously separate domains of the economy, art,\npolitics, and sexuality, collapsed into each other. He claims that art,\nfor instance, has penetrated all spheres of existence, whereby the\ndreams of the artistic avant-garde for art to inform life has been\nrealized. Yet, in Baudrillard\u2019s vision, with the realization of\nart in everyday life, art itself as a separate and transcendent\nphenomenon has disappeared.\n\n\nBaudrillard calls this situation \u201ctransaesthetics\u201d which\nhe relates to similar phenomena of \u201ctranspolitics,\u201d\n\u201ctranssexuality,\u201d and \u201ctranseconomics,\u201d in\nwhich everything becomes political, sexual, and economic, so that these\ndomains, like art, lose their specificity, their boundaries, and their\ndistinctness. The result is a confused condition where there are no\nmore criteria of value, of judgement, or of taste, and the function of\nthe normative thus collapses in a morass of indifference and inertia.\nAnd so, although Baudrillard sees art proliferating everywhere, and\nwrites in The Transparency of Evil that \u201ctalk about Art\nis increasing even more rapidly\u201d (p. 14), the power of art\n\u2014 of art as adventure, art as negation of reality, art as\nredeeming illusion, art as another dimension and so on \u2014 has\ndisappeared. Art is everywhere but there \u201care no more fundamental\nrules\u201d to differentiate art from other objects and \u201cno more\ncriteria of judgement or of pleasure\u201d (p. 14). For Baudrillard,\ncontemporary individuals are indifferent toward taste and manifest only\ndistaste: \u201ctastes are determinate no longer\u201d (p. 72).\n\n\nAnd yet as a proliferation of images, of form, of line, of color, of\ndesign, art is more fundamental then ever to the contemporary social\norder: \u201cour society has given rise to a general aestheticization:\nall forms of culture \u2014 not excluding anti-cultural ones \u2014\nare promoted and all models of representation and anti-representation\nare taken on board\u201d (p. 16). Thus Baudrillard concludes that:\n\u201cIt is often said that the West\u2019s great undertaking is the\ncommercialization of the whole world, the hitching of the fate of\neverything to the fate of the commodity. That great undertaking will\nturn out rather to have been the aestheticization of the whole world\n\u2014 its cosmopolitan spectacularization, its transformation into\nimages, its semiological organization\u201d (p. 16).\n\n\nIn the postmodern media and consumer society, everything becomes an\nimage, a sign, a spectacle, a transaesthetic object \u2014 just as\neverything also becomes trans-economic, trans-political, and\ntrans-sexual. This \u201cmaterialization of aesthetics\u201d\nis accompanied by a desperate attempt to simulate art, to replicate and\nmix previous artistic forms and styles, and to produce ever more images\nand artistic objects. But this \u201cdizzying eclecticism\u201d of\nforms and pleasures produces a situation in which art is no longer art\nin classical or modernist senses but is merely image, artifact, object,\nsimulation, or commodity (Baudrillard is aware of increasingly\nexorbitant prices for art works, but takes this as evidence that art\nhas become something else in the orbital hyperspace of value, an\necstasy of skyrocketing values in \u201ca kind of space opera\u201d\n[p. 19]).\n\n\nExamples of the paradoxical and ironic style of Baudrillard\u2019s\nphilosophical musings abound in The Perfect Crime (1996b).\nBaudrillard claims that the negation of a transcendent reality in the\ncurrent media and technological society is a \u201cperfect\ncrime\u201d that involves the \u201cdestruction of the real.\u201d\nIn a world of appearance, image, and illusion, Baudrillard suggests,\nreality disappears although its traces continue to nourish an illusion\nof the real. Driven toward virtualization in a high-tech society, all\nthe imperfections of human life and the world are eliminated in virtual\nreality, but this is the elimination of reality itself, the Perfect\nCrime. This \u201cpost-critical\u201d and \u201ccatastrophic\u201d\nstate of affairs render our previous conceptual world irrelevant,\nBaudrillard suggests, urging criticism to turn ironic and transform the\ndemise of the real into an art form.\n\n\nBaudrillard has entered a world of thought far from academic\nphilosophy, one that puts in question traditional modes of thought and\ndiscourse. His search for new philosophical perspectives has won him a\nloyal global audience, but also criticism for his excessive irony, word\nplay, and intellectual games. Yet his work stands as a provocation to\ntraditional and contemporary philosophy that challenges thinkers to\naddress old philosophical problems such as truth and reality in new\nways in the contemporary world.\n\n\nBaudrillard continues this line of thought in his 1999 text\nImpossible Exchange (2001). In three parts containing a series\nof short essays, he first develops his concept of an \u201cimpossible\nexchange\u201d between concepts and the world, theory and reality, and\nsubject and object. He attacks philosophical attempts to capture\nreality, arguing for an incommensurability between concepts and their\nobjects, systems of thought and the world. For Baudrillard, the latter\nalways elude capture by the former, thus philosophy is an\n\u201cimpossible exchange\u201d in which it is impossible to grasp\nthe truth of the world, to attain certainty, to establish a foundation\nfor philosophy, and/or produce a defensible philosophical system.\n\n\nIn retrospect, Baudrillard\u2019s philosophical play with the\nsubject/object distinction, his abandonment of the subject, and going\nover to the side of the object is a key aspect of his thought. He\nidentifies this dichotomy with the duality of good and evil in which\nthe cultivation of the subject and its domination of the object is\ntaken as the good within Western thought, while the sovereignty and\nside of the object is interwoven with the principle of evil.\nBaudrillard\u2019s thought is radically dualistic and he takes the\nside of the pole within a series of dichotomies of Western thought that\nhas generally been derided as inferior, such as siding with appearance\nagainst reality, illusion over truth, evil over good, and woman over\nman. In The Perfect Crime (1996b), Baudrillard has declared\nthat reality has been destroyed and henceforth that people live in a\nworld of mere appearance. In this universe, certainty and truth are\nimpossible and Baudrillard takes the side of illusion, arguing in\nImpossible Exchange (2001) that: \u201cIllusion is the\nfundamental rule\u201d (p. 6).\n\n\nBaudrillard also argues that the world is without meaning and that\naffirming meaninglessness is liberating: \u201cIf we could accept this\nmeaninglessness of the world, then we could play with forms,\nappearances and our impulses, without worrying about their ultimate\ndestination\u2026 As Cioran says, we are not failures until we\nbelieve life has a meaning \u2013 and from that point on we are\nfailures, because it hasn\u2019t\u201d (2001: 128). Most\ncontroversially, Baudrillard also identifies with the principle of evil\ndefined as that which is opposed to and against the good. There is an\nadmittedly Manichean and Gnostic dimension to his thought, mixed with\nskepticism, cynicism and\n nihilism.[10]\nDeconstruction, however, takes apart the\nsubject/object dichotomy indicating the impossibly of taking the side\nof subject or object, or of good and evil as both are interconnected\nwith each other and there can be no pure object without subject and\nvice versa, an argument Adorno has\n made.[11]\nBaudrillard\u2019s thought is intrinsically\ndualistic and not dialectical. His thought is self-avowedly agonistic\nwith the duel presented in tandem with his dualism, taking on and\nattacking rival theories and positions. Contradictions do not bother\nBaudrillard, for indeed he affirms them. It is thus tricky to argue\nwith Baudrillard on strictly philosophical grounds and one needs to\ngrasp his mode of writing, his notion of theory fictions (see\n Section 5),\nand to engage their saliency and effects.\n5. Theory Fictions: Baudrillard in the Contemporary Moment\n\n\nBaudrillard develops what he terms \u201ctheory fiction,\u201d or\nwhat he also calls \u201csimulation theory\u201d and\n\u201canticipatory theory.\u201d Such \u201ctheory\u201d intends to\nsimulate, grasp, and anticipate historical events, that he believes are\ncontinually outstripping all contemporary theory. The current\nsituation, he claims, is more fantastic than the most fanciful science\nfiction, or theoretical projections of a futurist society. Thus, theory\ncan only attempt to grasp the present on the run and try to anticipate\nthe future. However, he has had a mixed record as a social and\npolitical analyst and forecaster. As a political analyst, he has often\nbeen superficial and off the mark. In an essay \u201cAnorexic\nRuins\u201d published in 1989, he read the Berlin wall as a sign of a\nfrozen history, of an anorexic history, in which nothing more can\nhappen, marked by a \u201clack of events\u201d and the end of\nhistory, taking the Berlin wall as a sign of a stasis between communism\nand capitalism. Shortly thereafter, rather significant events destroyed\nthe wall that Baudrillard took as permanent and opened up a new\nhistorical era.\n\n\nThe Cold War stalemate was long taken by Baudrillard as establishing\na frozen history in which no significant change could take place.\nAlready in his mid-1970s reflections, he presented the Vietnam war as\nan \u201calibi\u201d to incorporate China, Russia, and eventually\nVietnam into a more rationalized and modernized world economic and\npolitical order (Baudrillard 1983a: 66f), and in his book on the Gulf\nwar he repeats this claim (1995: 85), thus failing to see the actual\npolitical stakes and reasons for the Vietnam war, as well as the\nsignificance of the struggles between capitalist and\ncommunist\n blocs.[12]\n\n\nFor Baudrillard, the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New\nYork also symbolized the frozen history and stasis between the two\nsystems of capitalism and communism. On the whole, he sees history as\nthe unfolding of expanding technological rationality turning into its\nopposite, as the system incorporates ever more elements, producing an\nimproved technological order, which then becomes irrational through its\nexcesses, its illusions, and its generating unforeseen consequences.\nThis mode of highly abstract analysis, however, occludes more specific\nhistorical determinants that would analyze how technological\nrationality is constructed and functioned and how and why it misfires.\nIt also covers over the disorder and turmoil created by such things as\nthe crises and restructuring of global capitalism, the rise of\nfundamentalism, ethnic conflict, and global terrorism which were\nunleashed in part as a response to a globalized rationalization of the\nmarket system and to the breakup of the bipolar world order.\n\n\nBaudrillard\u2019s reflections on the Gulf war take a similar\nposition, seeing it as an attempt of the New World Order to further\nrationalize the world, arguing that the Gulf war really served to bring\nIslam into the New World Order (1995: 19). The first study titled\n\u201cThe Gulf war will not take place\u201d was initially published\na few days before the actual outbreak of military hostilities and\nrepeats his earlier concept of \u201cweak events\u201d and frozen\nhistory. Baudrillard to the contrary, the Gulf war took place, but this\ndid not deter him from publishing studies claiming during the episode\nthat it was not \u201creally taking place\u201d and after the war\nasserting that it \u201cdid not take place\u201d \u2014 arguing that\nit was a media spectacle and not a genuine war. Baudrillard does not\nhelp us to understand much about the event and does not even help us to\ngrasp the role of the media in contemporary political spectacles.\nReducing complex events like wars to categories like simulation or\nhyperreality illuminates the virtual and high-tech dimension to media\nevents, but erases all their concrete determinants. And yet\nBaudrillardian postmodern categories help grasp some of the dynamics of\nthe culture of living in media and computer worlds where people seem to\nenjoy immersing themselves in simulated events (witness the fascination\nof the Gulf war in 1991, the O.J. Simpson trials during 1994\u20136, the\nClinton sex scandals, and various other media spectacles throughout the\n1990s, and the September 11 terror attacks in the early days of the\nthird\n millennium).[13]\n\n\nIn The End of the Illusion (1994b), Baudrillard attacks\nhead-on what he sees as current illusions of history, politics, and\nmetaphysics, and gamely tries to explain away his own political\nmisprognoses that contemporary history appeared in a frozen, glacial\nstate, stalemated between East and West, that the system of deterrence\nhad congealed, making sure that nothing dramatic could henceforth\nhappen, that the Gulf war couldn\u2019t take place, and that the end\nof history had occurred. Baudrillard unleashes his full bag of\nrhetorical tricks and philosophical analysis to attempt to maintain\nthese hypotheses in the face of the dramatic events of 1989\u20131991, which\nhe claims are in fact \u201cweak events,\u201d that events are still\non strike, that history has indeed\n disappeared.[14]\nHe continues to argue that modernity as a\nhistorical epoch is over, with its political conflicts and upheavals,\nits innovations and revolutions, its autonomous and creative subject,\nand its myths of progress, democracy, Enlightenment, and the like.\nThese myths, these strong ideas, are exhausted, he claims, and\nhenceforth a postmodern era of banal eclecticism, inertial implosion,\nand eternal recycling of the same become defining features.\n\n\nFor Baudrillard by the end of the 1990s with the collapse of\ncommunism, the era of the strong ideas, of a conflicted world of\nrevolution and universal emancipation, is over. Communism, on his\nreading, collapsed of its own inertia, it self-destructed from within,\nit imploded, rather than perishing in ideological battle or military\nwarfare. With the absorption of its dissidents into power, there is no\nlonger a clash of strong ideas, of opposition and resistance, of\ncritical transcendence. With the embedding of the former communist\nregimes into the system of the capitalist world market and liberal\ndemocracy, the West no longer has an Other to battle against, there is\nno longer any creative or ideological tension, no longer any global\nalternative to the Western world.\n\n\nBaudrillard celebrated the coming of the new millennium with a\nrecycling of some his old ideas on cloning, the end of history, and the\ndisappearance of the real in a series of lectures collected as The\nVital Illusion (2000). For Baudrillard (2000), cloning is\nconnected to the fantasy of immortality, to defeating the life-cycle.\nThus, it is no surprise that cryogenics \u2014 the freezing of dead\nhuman beings in the hope they might be regenerated in the future\nthrough medical advances \u2014 is a booming global industry.\nLikewise, in a digital era, he claims that history has come to an end\nand reality has been killed by virtualization, as the human species\nprepares itself for a virtual existence. Baudrillard complained that\nthe contemporary era was one of weak events, that no major historical\noccurrences had happened, and that therefore life and thought were\nbecoming increasingly boring.\n\n\nShortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Baudrillard wrote\na paper \u201cL\u2019esprit du terrorisme\u201d published November\n2, 2001, in Le Monde. He argued that the assaults on the World\nTrade Center and Pentagon constituted a \u201cstrong event,\u201d\nthat the attacks were \u201cthe ultimate event, the mother of all\nevents, the pure event uniting within itself all the events that have\nnever taken place.\u201d The \u201cevent strike,\u201d Baudrillard\ndeclared, was over and since this time he has continued to focus\nintensely on the dynamics and happenings of contemporary history.\n\n\nHence, Baudrillard\u2019s thought was reignited by 9/11 and the\nsubsequent Terror War which demonstrate the continuing relevance of\nsome of his key categories and that produced some of his most\nprovocative later work. He had long written on terrorism and was\nfocusing reflection on globalization when the 9/11 attacks occurred. He\nquickly responded with the Le Monde article, soon after\ntranslated and expanded into one of the more challenging and\ncontroversial books on the terror spectacle, The Spirit of\nTerrorism: And Requiem for the Twin Towers (2002a). For\nBaudrillard, the 9/11 attacks represent a new kind of terrorism,\nexhibiting a \u201cform of action which plays the game, and lays hold\nof the rules of the game, solely with the aim of disrupting it\u2026\nthey have taken over all the weapons of the dominant\npower\u201d. That is, the terrorists in Baudrillard\u2019s\nreading used airplanes, computer networks, and the media associated\nwith Western societies to produce a spectacle of terror. The attacks\nevoked a global specter of terror that the very system of globalization\nand Western capitalism and culture were under assault by \u201cthe\nspirit of terrorism\u201d and potential terrorist attacks anytime and\nanywhere.\n\n\nFor Baudrillard, \u201cthe speeches and commentaries made since\nSeptember 11 betray a gigantic post-traumatic abreaction both to the\nevent itself and to the fascination that it exerts. The moral\ncondemnation and the sacred union against terrorism are directly\nproportional to the prodigious jubilation felt at having seen this\nglobal superpower destroyed.\u201d Baudrillard perceived that the\nterrorists hope that the system will overreact in response to the\nmultiple challenges of terrorism: \u201cIt is the terrorist model to\nbring about an excess of reality, and have the system collapse beneath\nthat excess\u201d.\n\n\nIn Baudrillard\u2019s view, the 9/11 attacks represented \u201cthe\nclash of triumphant globalization at war with itself\u201d and\nunfolded a \u201cfourth world war\u201d: \u201cThe first put an end\nto European supremacy and to the era of colonialism; the second put an\nend to Nazism; and the third to Communism. Each one brought us\nprogressively closer to the single world order of today, which is now\nnearing its end, everywhere opposed, everywhere grappling with hostile\nforces. This is a war of fractal complexity, waged worldwide against\nrebellious singularities that, in the manner of antibodies, mount a\nresistance in every cell.\u201d (Sokal and Bricmont (1998) have\ncriticized Baudrillard for such metaphoric use of scientific\nterminology.)\n\n\nUpon the initial publication of his response in French newspapers\nand its immediate translation into English and other languages,\nBaudrillard himself was accused of justifying terrorism when he stated\nin the article in Le Monde: \u201cBecause it was this\ninsufferable superpower [i.e., the US] that gave rise both to the\nviolence now spreading throughout the world and to the terrorist\nimagination that (without our knowing it) dwells within us all. That\nthe entire world without exception had dreamed of this event, that\nnobody could help but dream of the destruction of so powerful a Hegemon\n\u2014 this fact is unacceptable to the moral conscience of the West.\nAnd yet it\u2019s a fact nevertheless, a fact that resists the\nemotional violence of all the rhetoric conspiring to cover it up. In\nthe end, it was they who did it, but we who wished\n it.\u201d[15]\n\n\nBaudrillard defended himself from accusations that such reflections\nconstituted a virulent anti-Americanism or legitimation of terrorism,\nclaiming: \u201cI do not praise murderous attacks \u2014 that would\nbe idiotic. Terrorism is not a contemporary form of revolution against\noppression and capitalism. No ideology, no struggle for an objective,\nnot even Islamic fundamentalism, can explain it. \u2026I have\nglorified nothing, accused nobody, justified nothing. One should not\nconfuse the messenger with his message. I have endeavored to analyze\nthe process through which the unbounded expansion of globalization\ncreates the conditions for its own\n destruction\u201d.[16]\n\n\nIndeed, Baudrillard has also produced some provocative reflections\non globalization. In \u201cThe Violence of the Global,\u201d he\ndistinguishes between the global and the universal, linking\nglobalization with technology, the market, tourism, and information\ncontrasted to identification of the universal with \u201chuman rights,\nliberty, culture, and\n democracy.\u201d[17]\nWhile \u201cglobalization appears to be\nirreversible, \u2026 universalization is likely to be on its way\nout.\u201d Elsewhere, Baudrillard writes: \u201c\u2026the idea of\nfreedom, a new and recent idea, is already fading from the minds and\nmores, and liberal globalization is coming about in precisely the\nopposite form \u2014 a police-state globalization, a total control, a\nterror based on \u2018law-and-order\u2019 measures. Deregulation ends\nup in a maximum of constraints and restrictions, akin to those of a\nfundamentalist\n society.\u201d[18]\n\n\nMany see globalization as a matrix of market economy, democracy,\ntechnology, migration and tourism, and the worldwide circulation of\nideas and culture. Baudrillard, curiously, takes the position of those\nin the anti-globalization movement who condemn globalization as the\nopposite of democracy and human rights. For him, globalization is\nfundamentally a process of homogenization and standardization that\ncrushes \u201cthe singular\u201d and heterogeneity. This position,\nhowever, fails to note the contradictions that globalization\nsimultaneously produces homogenization and hybridization and\ndifference, and that the anti-corporate globalization movement is\nfighting for social justice, democratization, and increased rights,\nfactors that Baudrillard links with a dying universalization. In fact,\nthe struggle for rights and justice is an important part of\nglobalization and Baudrillard\u2019s presenting of human rights,\ndemocratization, and justice as part of an obsolete universalization\nbeing erased by globalization is theoretically and\npolitically\n problematical.[19]\n\n\nBefore 9/11, Baudrillard saw globalization and technological\ndevelopment producing standardization and virtualization that was\nerasing individuality, social struggle, critique and reality itself as\nmore and more people became absorbed in the hyper and virtual realities\nof media and cyberspace and virtual culture. This disappearance of\nreality constituted the \u201cperfect crime\u201d which is the\nsubject of a book of that title (1996b) and elaborated in The Vital\nIllusion (2000). Baudrillard presents himself here as a detective\nsearching for the perpetrator of the \u201cperfect crime,\u201d the\nmurder of reality, \u201cthe most important event of modern\nhistory.\u201d His recurrent theme is the destruction and\ndisappearance of the real in the realm of information and simulacra,\nand the subsequent reign of illusion and appearance. In a Nietzschean\nmode, he suggests that henceforth truth and reality are illusions, that\nillusions reign, and that therefore people should respect illusion and\nappearance and give up the illusory quest for truth and reality.\n\n\nYet in the 9/11 attacks and subsequent Terror War, difference and\nconflict have erupted upon the global stage and heterogeneous forces\nthat global capitalism appears unable to absorb and assimilate have\nemerged that have produced what appears to be an era of intense\nconflict. Ideological apologists of globalization such as Thomas\nFriedman have been forced to acknowledge that globalization has its\ndark sides and produces conflict as well as networking, interrelations,\nand progress. It remains to be seen, of course, how the current Terror\nWar and intensified global conflicts will be resolved.\n6. Concluding Assessment\n\n\nBaudrillard has never been as influential in France as in the\nEnglish-speaking world and elsewhere \u2013 a point made in many\nFrench obituaries upon his death. He is an example of the\n\u201cglobal popular,\u201d a thinker who has\nfollowers and readers throughout the world, though, so far, no\nBaudrillardian school has\n emerged.[20]\nBaudrillard\u2019s influence has been largely at\nthe margins of a diverse number of disciplines ranging from social\ntheory to philosophy to art history, thus it is difficult to gauge his\nimpact on philosophy or the mainstream of any specific academic\ndiscipline.\n\n\nBaudrillard is perhaps most important as part of the postmodern turn\nagainst modern society and its academic disciplines. His work cuts\nacross the disciplines and promotes cross-disciplinary thought. He\nchallenges standard wisdom and puts in question received dogma and\nmethods. While his early work on the consumer society, the political\neconomy of the sign, simulation and simulacra, and the implosion of\nphenomena previously separated can be deployed within critical\nphilosophy and social theory, much of his post-1980s work quite\nself-consciously goes beyond the classical tradition and in most\ninterviews of the past decade Baudrillard distances himself from\ncritical philosophy and social theory, claiming that the energy of\ncritique has dissipated.\n\n\nBaudrillard thus emerges in retrospect as a transdisciplinary\ntheorist of the end of modernity who produces sign-posts to the new era\nof postmodernity and is an important, albeit hardly trustworthy, guide\nto the new era. One can read Baudrillard\u2019s post-1970s work as\nscience fiction that anticipates the future by exaggerating present\ntendencies, and thus provides early warnings about what might happen if\npresent trends continue (Kellner 1995). It is not an accident that\nBaudrillard is an aficionado of science fiction, who has himself\ninfluenced a large number of contemporary science fiction writers and\nfilmmakers of the contemporary era, including The Matrix\n(1999) where his work is\n cited.[21]\n\n\nHowever, in view of his exaggeration of the alleged break with\nmodernity, it is ambiguous whether Baudrillard\u2019s last two decades\nof work is best read as science fiction or theory. He obviously wants\nto have it both ways with social theorists thinking that he provides\nsalient perspectives on contemporary social realities, that Baudrillard\nreveals what is really happening, that he tells it like it is. And yet\nmore cynical anti-sociologists are encouraged to enjoy\nBaudrillard\u2019s fictions, his experimental discourse, his games,\nand play. Likewise, he sometimes encourages cultural metaphysicians to\nread his work as serious reflections on the realities of our time,\nwhile winking a pataphysical aside at those skeptical of such\nundertakings. And Baudrillard\u2019s philosophical writings provoke\nphilosophers to defend their positions against his and to rethink\ncertain traditional questions in the light of contemporary\nrealities.\n\n\nThus, it is difficult to decide whether Baudrillard is best read as\nscience fiction and pataphysics, or as philosophy, social theory, and\ncultural metaphysics, and whether his post-1970s work should be read\nunder the sign of truth or fiction. In retrospect, Baudrillard\u2019s\nearly critical explorations of the system of objects and consumer\nsociety contain some of his most important contributions to\ncontemporary social theory. His mid-1970s analysis of a dramatic\nmutation occurring within contemporary societies and rise of a new mode\nof simulation, which sketched out the effects of media and information\non society as a whole, is also original and important. But at this\nstage of his work, Baudrillard falls prey to a technological\ndeterminism and semiological idealism which posits an autonomous\ntechnology and play of signs generating a society of simulation which\ncreates a postmodern break and the proliferation of signs, spectacles,\nand simulacra. Baudrillard erases autonomous and differentiated spheres\nof the economy, polity, society, and culture posited by classical\nsocial theory in favor of an implosive theory that also crosses\ndisciplinary boundaries, thus mixing philosophy and social theory into\na broader form of social diagnosis and philosophical play.\n\n\nIn the final analysis, Baudrillard is perhaps more useful as a\nprovocateur who challenges and puts in question the tradition of\nclassical philosophy and social theory than as someone who provides\nconcepts and methods that can be applied in philosophical, social or\ncultural analysis. He claims that the object of classical social theory\n\u2014 modernity \u2014 has been surpassed by a new postmodernity and\nthat therefore alternative theoretical strategies, modes of writing,\nand forms of theory are necessary. While his work on simulation and the\npostmodern break from the mid-1970s into the 1980s provides a\nparadigmatic postmodern theory and analysis of postmodernity that has\nbeen highly influential, and that despite its exaggerations continues\nto be of use in interpreting present social trends, his later work is\narguably of more literary interest. Baudrillard thus ultimately goes\nbeyond philosophy and classical social theory altogether into a new\nsphere and mode of writing that provides occasional biting critical\ninsights into contemporary social phenomena and provocative critiques\nof contemporary and classical philosophy and social theory. He now\nappears, in retrospect, as a completely idiosyncratic thinker who went\nhis own way and developed his own mode of writing and thought that will\ncontinue to provoke contemporary and future students of philosophy and\ncritical theory.\n",
