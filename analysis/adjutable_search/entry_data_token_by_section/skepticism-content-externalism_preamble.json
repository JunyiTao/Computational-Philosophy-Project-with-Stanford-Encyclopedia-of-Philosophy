{
    "main_text": "\n\nA number of skeptical hypotheses or scenarios have been proposed which\ncan be used as the basis for arguments to the effect that we lack\nknowledge of various propositions about objects in the external world,\npropositions that we normally take for granted and that we assume are\nobviously true. Descartes\u2019 Evil Genius hypothesis is perhaps the\nbest known such hypothesis. Another is the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis,\naccording to which human beings are brains in vats whose mental\nexperiences, although qualitatively the same as in their normal lives,\nare all caused by a supercomputer. The skeptic then argues that many\nof the propositions about the external world that we take for granted\n(such as \u201cTrees are green\u201d) are propositions that we\ndon\u2019t know, since our evidence for such propositions is often\nexactly the same as the evidence we would have in a vat-world in which\nthese propositions are false.\n\nHilary Putnam (1981) proposed an interesting and much discussed\nattempt to refute a skeptical argument that is based on one form of\nthe brain-and-a-vat scenario. In turn, Putnam\u2019s attempted\nrefutation is based on content externalism (also known as semantic\nexternalism). On this view, the referents and meanings of various\ntypes of singular and general terms, as well as the propositions\nexpressed by sentences containing such terms, are determined by\naspects of the speaker\u2019s external environment. In this entry, we\nwill consider the basic features of and problems with Putnam\u2019s\noriginal argument, and we will also present and discuss several of the\nmost important attempts to reconstruct or improve upon that\nargument.\n",
