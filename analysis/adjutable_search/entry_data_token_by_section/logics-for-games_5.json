    "main_text": "Overview || Probability\n1.5 Probability\n\nGame theory may be understood as generalized interactive decision\ntheory. A major vehicle for the latter, just as for standard decision\ntheory, is probability theory. Within games, probability can assume\nmany roles. It may, for instance, express players\u2019 degrees of\nbelief quantitatively, but it can also enrich the space of actions\nwith mixed strategies, thereby laying the ground for general\nequilibrium results. Probability can even play a role in the very\ndefinition of certain important games, especially in evolutionary game\ntheory (Osborne & Rubinstein 1994).\nIn this entry, probability is only mentioned in passing.\n Section 5,\n however, maps some combinations of logic and probability that are\nsuggested by the study of games.\n",
