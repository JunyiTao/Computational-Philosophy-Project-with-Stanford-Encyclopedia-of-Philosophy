    "main_text": "Related uses of \u2018natural\u2019 || Natural classes\n3.1 Natural classes\n\nAs part of his notorious \u201cmodal realism\u201d (see \u00a76 of\nthe entry on\n David Lewis),\n Lewis identified properties with sets: for example, the property of\nbeing a talking donkey is just the set of all talking donkeys (a set\nwhich Lewis, surprisingly, held to be nonempty). Few philosophers have\naccepted this view. The dominant view is that distinct properties can\nhave exactly the same instances, although distinct sets never have\nexactly the same members. Many are nevertheless happy to apply\n\u2018natural\u2019 to sets (or classes) as well as properties: for\nexample, the class of all green things would be counted as more\nnatural than the class of grue things.\n\nIt seems plausible that there should be some intimate connection\nbetween this notion of naturalness for classes and naturalness for\nproperties; but it is not obvious how it should be spelled out. Since\nthere seem to be differences in naturalness among coextensive\nproperties\u2014for example, being charged seems more\nnatural than being charged and not a talking\ndonkey\u2014identifying a property\u2019s degree of naturalness\nwith that of its extension (the class of its instances) is not a\npromising approach. More plausibly, one might identify the degree of\nnaturalness of a class with the maximum degree of naturalness\nof the properties whose extension it is, or with some kind of\naggregate of the degrees of naturalness of these properties. However,\nthis may still be too simple, since there is a case that the\nnaturalness of other properties need to be taken into account. For\nexample, if there is a very natural equivalence relation (reflexive,\nsymmetric, transitive relation) with only a few equivalence classes,\nwe might want to count those equivalence classes as highly natural\neven if they are not the extensions of any highly natural monadic\nproperties.\n",
