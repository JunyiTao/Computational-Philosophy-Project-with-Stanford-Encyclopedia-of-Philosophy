    "main_text": "Criticisms against the Moderns || Against Avicenna\n3.1 Against Avicenna\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif makes a series of criticisms on Avicenna\u2019s\nphilosophy (Martini Bonadeo 2013; Ben Ahmed 2019). In the first place,\nhe explains that Avicenna did not manage to present an exhaustive\nphilosophical system in which every field of philosophical research\ncould receive adequate treatment. \u2018Abd al-Latif criticizes\nAvicenna\u2019s lack of reflection on the practical field. Even in\nhis most famous summa, the Kitab al-Shifa\u2019, Avicenna\nneglected the contents of Plato\u2019s Republic,\nAristotle\u2019s Ethics, and his Politics.\n\u2018Abd al-Latif explains this omission as a total lack of\nfamiliarity by Avicenna not only of practical philosophy, but also of\nphilosophy in general.\n\nIn the second place, according to \u2018Abd al-Latif, Avicenna seems\nto have distorted or not to have had any knowledge of the fundamental\nAristotelian epistemological criterion according to which research\nmust begin with that which is more easily knowable to us (cf.\nAristotle, Physics I.1, 184a16\u201321; Nicomachean\nEthics I.4, 1095b3\u20134). This is why, for example Avicenna\nmistakenly placed zoology after his treatment of the soul.\n\nNext, \u2018Abd al-Latif points out that Avicenna has produced\nnumerous works, which have been copied from one another, as in the\ncase of the Kitab al-Shifa\u2019 and the Kitab\nal-Najat. He observes that Avicenna decided to introduce all his\ntreatises with the discourse presented by Aristotle at the beginning\nof the Posterior Analytics (ll, 71a1\u20133) on every form\nof knowledge. But this is all that Avicenna knows of the Posterior\nAnalytics. In fact, he has not dealt with what constitutes the\nend of logic, that is to say, the five logical arts which are the\nobject of the Posterior Analytics, the Topics, the\nSophistical Refutations, the Rhetoric, and the\nPoetics, and he has dwelt on an analysis of the contents of\nthe Isagoge, Categories, De Interpretatione\nand Prior Analytics which, according to \u2018Abd al-Latif,\nconstitute a preparatory introduction to true logic. Even the\nKitab al-Shifa\u2019, which deals with logic at greater\nlength, presents a confused discourse. \u2018Abd al-Latif provides\nexamples which strengthen his strong criticism. In the first place it\nis surprising to him that Avicenna has not clarified the category of\n\u201chaving\u201d (\u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd; for\nits Arabic translations see Afnan 1964: 89\u201390). But, in fact, in\nthe section on the categories (al-Maqulat) of the Kitab\nal-Shifa\u2019, Avicenna devotes few words to his explanation of\nthe meaning and the value of this category. He maintains that it is\nnot a clear category and recognizes that he has not managed to\nunderstand it because he does not see how it can contain species.\nMoreover, \u2018Abd al-Latif is amazed by the fact that Avicenna\nplaces the movement of the sky in the category of\n\u201cBeing-in-a-position\u201d\n(\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9), even\nthough he himself has written a book on the De Caelo et mundo\nand on the Physics. The category of\n\u03ba\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 is\nexplained by Avicenna both in the Kitab al-Shifa\u2019 and\nthe Kitab al-Najat as the manner of being of the body in as\nfar as the fact that its parts constitute, one with another, a\nrelation of inclination and parallelism in relation to the directions\nand the parts of the place, if the body is in a place, such as, for\nexample standing up and sitting down. \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s\nthird criticism is of Avicenna\u2019s claim that he can define one of\ntwo relative terms without having recourse to the other. \u2018Abd\nal-Latif stresses that in the Isagoge Avicenna defines genus\nseparately and species separately and father separately and son\nseparately. Then in his definition of father as a \u201cliving thing\nwhich creates from his sperm another living thing similar to\nhim\u201d Avicenna finds himself obliged to seek recourse to four\ndistinct relations.\n\n\u2018Abd al-Latif proceeds to criticize Avicenna\u2019s theory of\nthe syllogism and in particular his admission of the hypothetical\nsyllogisms. Finally, \u2018Abd al-Latif makes a series of further\ncriticisms of Avicenna without, however, going into each of them in\ndetail. Avicenna has enlarged the book of the Poetics with an\namount of material which actually derives from the Rhetoric.\nSince Avicenna\u2019s Kitab al-Shifa\u2019, despite its\nnumerous errors, has become the philosophical encyclopedia of\nreference among \u2018Abd al-Latif\u2019s contemporaries, he\nbelieves that Avicenna is the indirect cause of the vast spread of\nphilosophical errors, such as the confusing, for example, the object\nproper to the Physics, that is, nature, with that of the\nMetaphysics.\n",
