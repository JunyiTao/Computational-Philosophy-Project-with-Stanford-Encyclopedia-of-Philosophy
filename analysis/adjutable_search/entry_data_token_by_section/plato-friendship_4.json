The Art and Psychology of Love Explained\n\nIn the Phaedrus we find a more detailed account of the\npsychology and art of love than in the Symposium. This\naccount will be our exclusive focus. The soul, whether divine or\nhuman, Socrates claims, is like \u201cthe natural union of a team of\nwinged horses and their charioteer\u201d (246a6\u20137). But whereas\nin a divine soul all three elements are \u201cgood and come from good\nstock,\u201d in a human soul the white horse (familiar from\nRepublic IV as the honor-loving spirited element) is\n\u201cbeautiful and good, and of similar stock,\u201d while the\nblack one (the Republic\u2019s appetitive element) is\n\u201cthe opposite and of the opposite stock,\u201d so that\n\u201cthe driving in our case is necessarily difficult and\ntroublesome\u201d (a7-b4). When spirit together with the charioteer\n(the Republic\u2019s rational element, there too identified\nwith what is truly human rather than bestial in us\n(588b10\u2013589a4)) \u201cleads us towards what is best and is in\ncontrol,\u201d we possess moderation\n(s\u00f4phrosun\u00ea) (237e2\u20133). But when\n\u201cappetite drags us irrationally towards pleasures and rules in\nus, its rule is called excess (hubris)\u201d\n(238a1\u20132). Of this excess, gluttony is one species, but erotic\nlove another (238b7-c4). This is the bad kind of love\u2014Pandemotic\nin the Symposium\u2014that Lysias rightly disparages in the\nspeech Phaedrus admires and reads to Socrates (230e6\u2013234c5).\n\nIn Socrates\u2019 view, however, there is also another kind of love,\nnamely, \u201cthe madness of a man who, on seeing beauty here on\nearth, and being reminded of true beauty, becomes winged, and\nfluttering with eagerness to fly upwards, but unable to leave the\nground, looks upwards like a bird, and takes no heed of things\nbelow\u2014and that is what causes him to be regarded as mad\u201d\n(249d5-e1). This madman is the philosopher of the Symposium,\nwho when he falls in love with a boy is led by his love to ascend by\nstages to the form of the beautiful. What makes his madness a divine\ngift, however, is that the ascent is now revealed as involving\nrecollection of a prior pre-natal ascent taken in the company of a\ngod.\n\nFrom the rich literary account of this ascent, we need to take away\njust one idea: souls have different psychological structures depending\non which god they followed, since this sets an upper limit on how much\nof the forms they see, and so how much they can subsequently\nrecollect. Since gaining access to forms nourishes and strengthens the\nrational element in the soul (248b5-c2), this also helps determine\ntheir motivational structure: the stronger their reason is, the more\nlikely it will be to succeed in controlling the other elements in the\nsoul.\n\nFollowers of Zeus, for example, choose someone to love whose soul\nresembles their patron god. So they seek someone who is\n\u201cnaturally disposed to philosophy and leadership, and when they\nhave found him and fall in love they do everything to make him\nphilosophical\u201d (252e1\u20135). Nonetheless, the falling itself\ninvolves a huge psychological upheaval. The black horse of appetite\nimmediately urges towards sexual intercourse. The white\nhorse\u2014\u201cconstrained then as always by shame\u201d\n(254a2)\u2014holds itself back. Eventually, however, the black horse\nforces both the charioteer and the white horse \u201cto move towards\nthe beloved and mention to him the delights of sex\u201d\n(a5\u20137). Again they balk, \u201cindignant at being forced to do\nterrible and improper things\u201d (b1). But finally, \u201cwhen\nthere is no limit to their plight, they follow its lead, giving in and\nagreeing to do what it tells them\u201d (b2\u20133). As they come\nclose to the beloved, however, to initiate intercourse, the flashing\nface of the beloved reminds the charioteer of the beautiful itself, so\nthat his memory \u201cagain sees it standing together with temperance\non a holy pedestal\u201d (b5\u20137). He becomes frightened and\n\u201cin sudden reverence falls on his back, and is forced at the\nsame time to pull back the reins so violently as to bring the horses\ndown on their haunches, the one willingly, because of it lack of\nresistance to him, but the unruly horse much against its will\u201d\n(b7-c3). Eventually, \u201cwhen the same thing happens to the evil\nhorse many times, it allows the charioteer with his foresight to\nlead\u201d (e5\u20137). If this control of appetite by reason and\nspirit continues\u2014even when the boy has accepted his lover and\nembraces, kisses, and lies down with him\u2014and draws them to\n\u201ca well-ordered life and to philosophy,\u201d they are\nblessedly happy here on earth, and, if they live such a life for three\nsuccessive incarnations, they re-grow their wings and re-join the\nentourage of their god (255e2-b7).\n\nWhen followers of Ares fall in love, on the other hand, they\n\u201cadopt a lower way of living, not philosophical, but\nhonor-loving\u201d (256b7-c1). When they are drinking together, for\nexample, or are careless in some other way, \u201cthe licentious\nhorses in the two of them catch their souls off guard,\u201d and\nsince the man\u2019s recollection of beauty is dimmer and is not\nrekindled by philosophical conversation, they end up having sex\ntogether\u2014something \u201cthe masses regard as the happiest\nchoice of all\u201d (c1\u20135). Nonetheless, they don\u2019t have\nsex very often, because \u201cwhat they are doing has not been\napproved by their whole mind\u201d (c6\u20137). So while the degree\nof their love and happiness is less than the philosophical pair and,\non their death, \u201cthey leave the body without wings,\u201d still\nthey have an impulse, coming from love, to try to gain them. Hence\nthey aren\u2019t punished in the next life, but helped on the way to\nfuture happiness together (c7-e2).\n\nThe love that is divine madness is a good thing, therefore, especially\nwhen, \u201caccompanied by philosophical discussions (er\u00f4ta\nmeta philosoph\u00f4n log\u00f4n)\u201d (257b6), it leads to\nthe beautiful itself and the other forms, which are what we\u2014as\nmost of all the rational element in our souls\u2014truly love and\ncrave. The question is what makes a discussion philosophical? What\nmakes it of the sort to be included in the true art of love that the\nphilosopher who loves the beautiful itself practices? The answer now\nproposed is that it must be a techn\u00ea or craft, and so\nmust have the defining characteristics of one. As applied to love\nitself, for example, it must begin with a definition of love, and\nreach its conclusions by ordering its discussion in relation to it\n(263d5-e3). And this definition, in turn, must be established by what\nSocrates refers to as collection and division (266b3\u20134).\n\nCollection is a process of \u201cperceiving together and bringing\ninto one form items that are scattered in many places\u201d\n(265d3\u20134). It is a process that we, unlike other animals, are\nable to engage in it, because our souls include a rational element\nthat has prior acquaintance with forms: \u201ca soul that never\n[prenatally] saw what is true cannot take a human shape, since a human\nbeing must understand what is said by relation to a form that is\nreached from many sense-perceptions being collected into one by\nreasoning\u201d (249b5-c1). (It is useful to compare this description\nwith the one given in Aristotle, Posterior Analytics II.\n19.)\n\nOnce a form has been reached in this way, division begins. This is a\nmatter of \u201ccutting the form up again, by relation to\n[sub-]forms, by relation to its natural joints\u201d (265e1-2). As an\nexample, Socrates cites the case of love itself:\n\njust as a single body naturally has its parts in pairs, with both\nmembers of each pair having the same name, and labeled respectively\nleft and right, so the two speeches regarded madness as naturally a\nsingle form in us. The one [Socrates\u2019 reorganized version of\nLysias\u2019 attack on love] cut off the part on the left side, then\ncutting it again, and not giving up until it had found among the parts\na love which is, as we say, \u201cleft-handed,\u201d and abused it\nwith full justice, while the other speech [Socrates\u2019 own defense\nof love] led us to the parts of madness on the right-hand side, and\ndiscovering and exhibiting a love which shares the same name as the\nother, but is divine, it praised it as a cause of our greatest goods.\n(265e4\u2013266b1)\n\n\nThus, while each speech tells only half the story, the two together\nshow how correct division should proceed. The goal, however,\nisn\u2019t just truth or correctness, but explanatory adequacy. Thus\nif the form in question \u201cis simple, we should\nconsider\u2026what natural capacity it has for acting and on what,\nor for being acted upon and by what,\u201d and if it is complex, we\nshould count its sub-forms, and consider the same things about them as\nabout the simple ones (270d3\u20137). That Socrates\u2014the\narchetypal searcher for explanatory definitions (Euthyphro\n6d9-e6)\u2014should pronounce himself \u201ca lover of these\ndivisions and collections\u201d is no surprise, therefore\n(266b3\u20134).\n\nPhilosophy aims at true definitions and true stories based on them.\nBut it also aims at persuasion, since the philosophical lover wants to\npersuade his boy to follow him on the path to the forms. Philosophy\nand rhetoric must thus go together, which means that rhetoric, too,\nmust be developed as a techn\u00ea. It must, first,\ndistinguish and give definitions of the various kinds of souls and\nkinds of speeches, revealing their respective capacities and\nsusceptibilities, and, second, \u201ccoordinate each kind of soul\nwith the kind of speech appropriate to it, explaining why one kind of\nsoul is necessarily convinced by one kind of speech, while another is\nnot\u201d (271b1\u20135). Mastery of such a science, however,\nrequires one further thing: \u201cthe student must observe these\nthings as they are in real life, and actually being put into practice,\nand be able to follow them with keen perception\u201d (d8-e1). It\nisn\u2019t enough, in other words, to know what kinds of speeches\naffect what kinds of soul, the philosophical rhetorician must also\nknow that this man in front of him is of such and such a kind, and be\nable to talk in the kind of way that will prove convincing to him\n(e2\u2013272b2).\n",
