    "main_text": "Influences\n2. Influences\n\nAddams was well-read and could claim numerous and varied influences.\nHowever, Addams was no one\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Addams chose\nintellectual resources that resonated with her notion of sympathetic\nknowledge in bringing about social progress. A few significant\ninfluences are recounted here. Addams read Thomas Carlyle\u2019s\n(1795\u20131881) work while she was attending Rockford Seminary.\nCarlyle\u2019s social morality held a particular appeal to Addams. He\nbelieved the universe was ultimately good and moral and led by a\ndivine will that worked through society\u2019s heroes and leaders.\nCarlyle wrote biographies of social saviors that came in the form of\npoets, kings, prophets, and intellectuals, mixing in commentary that\nexplicated his moral philosophy. However, Carlyle\u2019s heroes\nreflect the evolution of society, as different contexts require\ndifferent leadership. These heroes can recognize the social dynamics\nat work and use them for the benefit of others. Carlyle\u2019s heroes\nevolved. For Carlyle, everyone has a public duty and needs to find\nthemselves or realize their place in the world and what their work on\nbehalf of society should be. Because of his emphasis on powerful\nindividuals, Carlyle was not particularly fond of democracy. Although\nAddams shed Carlyle\u2019s notion of individualistic heroism and his\ndisdain for democracy, she retained the valorization of moral action\nthroughout her career. Furthermore, Carlyle\u2019s morality was\ngrounded in social relations: to be moral is to be in right relation\nwith God and others. Carlyle\u2019s relational ethic is a precursor to\nAddams\u2019 notion of sympathetic knowledge.\n\nAddams was also influenced by John Ruskin (1819\u20131900), who\ntheorized that art and culture reflected the moral health of society.\nAlthough Ruskin maintained a certain elitism in his view that great\npeople produced great art, he also saw such great cultural works as a\nmanifestation of the well-being of society as a whole. The plight of\nthe oppressed was tied to a sense of the aesthetic. Indeed,\nAddams\u2019 valorization of art and culture, as exhibited in the\nappearance and activities of Hull House resonates with Ruskin\u2019s\naesthetics. For Addams, \u201cSocial Life and art have always seemed\nto go best at Hull House\u201d (STY 354). Addams viewed art and\ncultural activities as reinforcing essential human bonds (DSE 29).\nRuskin also influenced Arnold Toynbee and other future settlement\nworkers by identifying the problems in large industrial cities and\ncalling for reforms foreshadowing the safety nets typical of later\nwelfare states. Ruskin valued labor as a noble means of\nself-actualization. This became a crucial concept for Addams as she\nsought meaningful labor for those in the Hull House neighborhood. For\nexample, Addams expresses sympathy for laborers who skipped work or\ncame in late for work because \u201call human interest has been\nextracted from it\u201d (SYC 129). Although Addams valued\nRuskin\u2019s moral imagination, the concept of labor, and ideas\nabout transforming the city through infusing culture, she rejected his\nromanticization of the preindustrial past. With a strong belief in\nsocial progress, Addams did not desire a return to a previous era. For\nAddams, society should grow and adapt to its conditions, even\nregarding moral philosophy.\n\nLeo Tolstoy (1828\u20131910) was another type of hero to Addams.\nUnlike Carlyle, Tolstoy did not valorize individuals standing out from\nthe crowd as exemplary moral paragons who wield socially ordained\npositions of power. Instead, he valued solidarity with the common\nlaborer. Addams\u2019 vast intellectual curiosity made such extremes\nin influences possible. Addams read Tolstoy\u2019s works from the\ntime she graduated from college until the last years of her life, and\nshe often praised his writing in articles and book reviews.\nTolstoy\u2019s emphasis on working for and with the oppressed while\nwriting novels and essays that influenced a wider audience resonated\nwith Addams\u2019 work and writings. However, Tolstoy was a moral\nidealist. He left everything behind to take up the plow and work as a\ntypical farm laborer. Addams was moved by Tolstoy\u2019s account,\nand\u2014typical of her self-critical, thoughtful approach--she\nquestioned her leadership role in the social settlement, but only for\na short time.\n\nMotivated by Tolstoy\u2019s troubling moral challenge to work in\nsolidarity with the common laborer, Addams sought him out while she\nwas on vacation (and recovering from typhoid) in Europe in 1896. The\nmeeting made a lasting impression on Addams (TYH 191\u2013195).\nTolstoy came in from working the fields to be introduced to Addams and\nher partner Mary Rozet Smith. The meeting began with Tolstoy\nquestioning Addams\u2019 fashion choice because the sleeves of her\narms, consistent with the style of the time, had \u201cenough stuff\non one arm to make a frock for the girl\u201d (TYH 192). Tolstoy was\nconcerned that the trappings of material wealth alienated Addams from\nthose she was working with. This criticism continued when Tolstoy\nlearned that part of Hull House\u2019s funding came from\nAddams\u2019 estate, which included a working farm: \u201cSo you are\nan absentee landlord? Do you think you will help the people more by\nadding yourself to the crowded city than you would by tilling your own\nsoil?\u201d (TYH 192) The remarks humbled Addams, and, on her return\nto Hull House, she was determined to take up more direct labor by\nworking in the new Hull House bakery. However, reality demonstrated\nhow Tolstoy\u2019s idealism was incompatible with her work in social\nsettlements: \u201cThe half dozen people invariably waiting to see me\nafter breakfast, the piles of letters to be opened and answered, the\ndemand of actual and pressing human wants\u2014were these all to be\npushed aside and asked to wait while I saved my soul by two\nhours\u2019 work at baking bread?\u201d (TYH 197)\n\nTheoretically, the shared experience of common labor would break down\nclass distinctions. Addams had experienced such camaraderie at Hull\nHouse, and she never stopped appreciating Tolstoy\u2019s social\ncriticism. However, she saw the value of intelligent leadership.\nSomeone had to organize the clubs, arrange for philanthropic support,\nand chair the meetings. Addams found Tolstoy\u2019s labor demand to\nbe self-indulgent to a certain extent. If she engaged in the labor of\nthe poor exclusively, she might alleviate her upper-class guilt.\nStill, she would no longer be working holistically toward changing the\nstructure of society. Addams\u2019 philosophy of civic activism\nvalued engagement through ongoing presence and listening. Indeed, Hull\nHouse had a very flat and responsive organizational structure.\nNevertheless, Tolstoy\u2019s absolutist moral demands failed to\nconsider context\u2014a hallmark of Addams\u2019 approach.\n\nAddams found Tolstoy\u2019s pacifism inspiring. She admired how\nTolstoy sympathized with revolutionaries in the 1870s but did not\ncompromise his moral convictions because of these sympathies. Tolstoy\noffered a doctrine of non-resistance that sought to substitute moral\nenergy for physical force. Addams once again did not accept\nTolstoy\u2019s pacifist ideas uncritically. For example, she\nquestioned the clarity of the categories (moral energy versus physical\nforce) that Tolstoy created in his doctrine of non-resistance (TYH\n195). Addams also asked whether Tolstoy reduced social issues too\nsimplistically, albeit eloquently. Despite her less than pleasant\nmeeting with him, Addams cited Tolstoy as a positive moral example\nthroughout her life. However, like all her influences, she could not\naccept Tolstoy\u2019s philosophy uncritically. Addams had to adapt\nand infuse her insight to make it work for the society she was a part\nof.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Toynbee Hall was an inspiration for Hull\nHouse, and Canon Barnett (1844\u20131913), who served as\n\u201cwarden\u201d of the settlement for over twenty years, was the\ninspirational force. Before his service at Toynbee Hall, Barnett\nworked as Vicar of St. Judes, Whitechapel. He instituted many\nimprovements to the slums surrounding the Church, including building\neducational and recreational programs. It was St. Judes that students\nfrom Oxford would visit, working to help improve conditions for\nresidents of the surrounding community, all the while engaging in\ndiscussions about how to institute social reforms. One of those\nstudents was Andrew Toynbee.\n\nBarnett describes a threefold rationale for the development and growth\nof settlements: First, a general distrust that government-sponsored\ninstitutions could care for the poor. In particular, government and\nprivate philanthropy appeared to be failing the masses. Second,\nBarnett viewed the need for information as spurring the rise of\nsettlements. Barnett believed there was widespread curiosity regarding\noppression that he could satisfy with documented observations\nregarding the circumstances of the poor. Finally, Barnett notes a\ngroundswell of fellowship not driven by traditional \u201cCharities\nand Missions\u201d but by fundamental humanitarianism. Settlements\nprovided an outlet for these fellow feelings.\n\nAddams was familiar with Barnett\u2019s writings and often referred\nto them. For example, when Addams wrote \u201cThe Function of the\nSocial Settlement,\u201d Barnett\u2019s philosophy played a\nprominent role. She agrees that settlements should not be\nmissions because if they become too ideological, they will fail to be\nresponsive to their neighbors (FSS 344\u2013345). However, despite\nacknowledging that the term \u201csettlement\u201d was borrowed from\nLondon, she finds differences between the philosophies of Toynbee Hall\nand Hull House: \u201cThe American Settlement, perhaps has not so\nmuch a sense of duty of the privileged toward the unprivileged of the\n\u2018haves\u2019 to the \u2018have nots,\u2019 to borrow Canon\nBarnett\u2019s phrase, as a desire to equalize through social effort\nthose results which superior opportunity may have given the\npossessor\u201d (FSS 322\u2013323). Addams is very concerned about a\nsense of moral superiority attributed to settlement work. She always\neschewed the notion that she was a charitable \u201clady\nbountiful.\u201d Instead, she wanted to learn about others to develop\nthe proper sympathies and strategies for assisting\u2014sympathetic\nknowledge. For Addams, Hull House always combined epistemological\nconcerns with moral ones.\n\nWhen Addams\u2019 philosophy is considered, if at all, it is usually\nassociated with the work of John Dewey (1859\u20131952). This\nassociation is appropriate given their friendship and mutual\ninterests; however, her intellectual deference to Dewey is often\noverstated. Dewey is considered one of the greatest American\nphilosophers. His name, along with William James, Charles Sanders\nPeirce, and Josiah Royce, is included in the traditional list of\nfounding fathers of what is labeled American Pragmatism. His work\nappealed to Addams because they shared many of the same commitments,\nincluding the value of a robust democracy as well as the importance of\neducation that engaged the student\u2019s experience. Addams and\nDewey were intellectual soul mates from the moment they met in 1892.\nDewey visited Hull House shortly after it opened and before he moved\nto Chicago to teach at the University of Chicago. Following the\nmeeting, Dewey expressed to Addams an appreciation for Hull\nHouse\u2019s work, and he would become a frequent visitor. There was\nmuch intellectual cross-fertilization between Hull House and the\nUniversity of Chicago and vice versa. Historian Rosalind\nRosenberg describes Addams as a de facto adjunct professor at\nthe University of Chicago. Mary Jo Deegan documents that Addams\ntaught many college courses through the Extension Division of the\nUniversity of Chicago for a decade. In addition, she refused offers to\njoin the undergraduate and graduate faculty (Deegan, 1988).\nFurthermore, Dewey assigned Addams\u2019 books in his courses. Addams\nand Dewey worked together personally and politically. When Hull House\nwas incorporated, Dewey became one of the board members. He often\nlectured to the Plato Club, Hull House\u2019s philosophy group. Dewey\ndedicated his book Liberalism and Social Action to Addams.\nDewey named one of his daughters in her honor, and Addams wrote the\neulogy for Dewey\u2019s son Gordon (EBP).\n\nAlthough Dewey and Addams gained celebrity status in their lifetime,\ntheir fame and legacies are characterized much differently. Dewey is\nframed as the great intellectual\u2014a thinker\u2014and Addams was\nthe activist\u2014a doer. As contemporaries, they represent classic\narchetypes of gender: the male as mind generating theory and the woman\nas body experiencing and caring. However, there is much evidence that\nsuch characterizations are inaccurate. Both John Dewey and his\ndaughter, Jane, credit Jane Addams for developing many of his\nimportant ideas, including his view on education, democracy, and,\nultimately, philosophy (Schlipp, 1951). Despite the lack of\nattribution in Dewey\u2019s written work, many scholars document\nAddams\u2019 significant influence (Davis, 1973; Deegan, 1988;\nFarrell, 1967; Lasch, 1965; Linn, 2000; Seigfried, 1996)\n\nOvershadowed by Addams\u2019 relationship with the celebrity\nphilosopher, Dewey, was her strong tie to George Herbert Mead\n(1863\u20131931), who is considered the father of \u201csymbolic\ninteractionism,\u201d an approach to social inquiry that emphasizes\nhow symbols create meaning in society. Mead\u2019s work on\ndevelopment through play and education influenced Addams, but, as with\nDewey, the influence was mutual. Addams maintained a long-term close\npersonal relationship with Mead and his wife, Helen Castle Mead. They\noften dined together and visited one another\u2019s families. Like\nAddams\u2019, Mead\u2019s intellectual legacy is not altogether\nsettled. Sociologists have recognized his works as significant, but\nmany philosophers have overlooked him.\n\nMead and Addams worked on several projects together, including\npro-labor speeches, peace advocacy, and the Progressive Party. When\nAddams was publicly attacked for not supporting the U.S. entry into\nWorld War I, Mead defended her though he disagreed with her position.\nLike Dewey, Mead was a frequent lecturer at Hull House. Also, like\nDewey, Mead could not help but be impressed with Addams\u2019\nintellect. In 1916, Mead advocated awarding Addams an honorary\ndoctorate from the University of Chicago. The faculty supported the\naward, but the administration overturned the decision (eventually\nmaking the award in 1931).\n\nAddams also maintained a friendship with William James\n(1842\u20131910), whose work she cites on many occasions. James was a\npragmatist whose vision of urban improvement would have been shared by\nAddams. James and Addams both valued experience, and among the\n\u201cprofessional\u201d pragmatists his writing style is\nclosest to Addams\u2019 in terms of its readability and use of\ntangible examples.\n\nAddams influenced and was influenced by the \u201cChicago\nSchool,\u201d an active collaboration of cross-disciplinary scholars\nat the University of Chicago, including Dewey, Mead, James Hayden\nTufts, Robert E. Park, and others who had a significant impact on\nphilosophy, psychology, and sociology. Although she was often\nfrustrated with the abstract trajectory of the university, Addams\nembraced reflective analysis. Through her Hull House experience,\nAddams took many opportunities to theorize about the interchange\nbetween theory and practice. For a time, American philosophy,\nsociology, and social work existed in a symbiotic harmony\u2014each\nnot differentiated from the other but benefiting from the interchange.\nUnfortunately, since the early 20th century when Mead,\nDewey, and Addams were together in Chicago, the intellectual genealogy\nof American philosophy, sociology, and social work has more\ndrastically diverged to a point where the crossover is less likely and\nperhaps less welcome. Lost in the compartmentalization of these\ndisciplines is how Jane Addams played a role in each.\n\nIn addition to the Romantics (Carlyle and Ruskin), the social\nvisionaries (Barnett and Tolstoy), and the pragmatists (Dewey and\nMead), Addams was influenced by the great collection of feminist minds\nwho came to work at the social settlement. Hull House has been\ndescribed in many different ways, reflecting the complexity and\ndiversity of its functions. Perhaps an overlooked descriptor is as a\npragmatist feminist \u201cthink tank.\u201d Although the\n\u201cMetaphysical Club\u201d has taken on a mythical status among\nsome in American philosophical circles (Menand, 2001), the\nintellectual, social, and political impact of the Hull House residents\ndwarfs that of the Cambridge intellectuals. Hull House residents\ndined, slept, did domestic chores, and engaged in social activism\ntogether. They also discussed and debated ethics, political theory,\nfeminism, and culture while immersed in their tasks and stimulated by\nthe many speakers and visitors to Hull House. The prolonged contact\nshared gender oppression and common mission made for a unique\nintellectual collective that not only fostered action but also\ntheory.\n\nOstensibly, Hull House was the first co-educational settlement. Addams\nrecognized the need for male residents so that men in the neighborhood\ncould better relate to Hull House endeavors. However, it was clear to\nvisitors and residents that Hull House was a woman\u2019s space. Hull\nHouse boasted some of the era\u2019s great minds and change agents. Alice\nHamilton (1869\u20131970), a physician who trained in Germany and the\nU.S. and is credited with founding the field of industrial medicine,\nlived at Hull House for 22 years. She went on to teach at Harvard,\nbecoming a nationally recognized social reformer and peace activist.\nJulia Lathrop (1858\u20131932) was a Vassar graduate who, in 1912,\nafter residing at Hull House for 22 years, became the first woman to\nhead a federal agency, the Children\u2019s Bureau, which, in terms of\nconduct, she modeled after Hull House. Rachel Yarros\n(1869\u20131946), a twenty-year resident at Hull House, was also a\nphysician who taught at the University of Illinois. The university\ncreated a position for Yarros to recognize her tremendous contribution\nto social hygiene and sex education. Author and feminist theorist\nCharlotte Perkins Gilman (1860\u20131935) was a resident for a short\ntime. Gilman thought highly of Addams but had no stomach for\nsettlement existence amongst the oppressed. However, Gilman\u2019s\ngroundbreaking work on gender and economics likely influenced Addams.\nSophonisba Breckinridge (1866\u20131948) graduated from Wellesley and\nobtained a Ph.D. in political science and a J.D. from the University\nof Chicago. Her most significant contribution was in the area of\nsocial work education. Edith Abbott (1876\u20131957) and her sister\nGrace Abbott (1878\u20131939) joined Hull-House about the time as\nBreckinridge (1907). Edith Abbott would obtain a Ph.D. in Political\nEconomy from the University of Chicago, while Grace Abbott earned a\nPh.D. from Grand Island College in Nebraska. Edith would have an\nacademic career at the University of Chicago prior to her appointment\nas Chief of the Children\u2019s Bureau after Julia Lathrop\u2019s\ndeparture. Mary Kenney (1864\u20131943) became a vital labor\norganizer for Samuel Gompers\u2019 American Federation of Labor and\ninfluenced Addams\u2019 sensitivity to the plight of organized labor,\nsomething that all progressives did not share. Bessie Abramowitz\nHillman, a Russian immigrant who attended classes at Hull House,\nfounded the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in 1910 at\nthe age of 20 and guided it for 60 years. Hillman referred to the\nsettlement as \u201ca House of Labor\u201d, and she worked with and\nadmired Addams until the latter\u2019s passing. Another resident who became\na significant labor leader was Alzina Stevens. She headed the Dorcas\nFederal Labor Union and became a member of the Council of Women\u2019s\nTrade Unions of Chicago. Addams worked with and cultivated numerous\nlabor leaders during this nascent time of the American labor movement.\nThese are only a few of the more well-known residents, but numerous\nfeminists used their Hull House experience as a springboard to careers\nin social reform or professions of various sorts. Addams engaged the\nresidents of Hull House in conversation and deliberation such that\nthey influenced her thoughts and she theirs.\n\nAlthough Hull House was replete with extraordinary minds, no one was\nlikely to be as intellectually challenging to Addams as Florence\nKelley (1859\u20131932). A Cornell graduate, Kelley translated\nFriedrich Engels\u2019 The Condition of the Working Class in\nEngland and Karl Marx\u2019s Free Trade into English.\nShe was an active member of the Socialist Labor Party until the\nleadership, threatened by Kelley\u2019s aggressive style, expelled\nher. A single mother with three children, Kelley found a home at Hull\nHouse, where she opened an employment center and began researching\nsweatshops for the Illinois Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kelley would\nlater become the general secretary of the new Consumer\u2019s League,\nan organization dedicated to using consumer pressure to ensure that\nsafe and high-quality goods were manufactured. Kelley was one of the\nmost distinguished social reformers of the early 20th\nCentury.\n\nAt Hull House, Kelley altered the dynamics of the resident community.\nShe brought a sense of class consciousness along with great strength\nof conviction. After Kelley\u2019s arrival (and Mary Kenny\u2019s\ncoming a year prior) Hull House became more deeply involved in\nsupporting the labor movement, which men heretofore dominated. Kelley\nalso learned from Addams, who she admired throughout her life. Perhaps\nthe legacy of the many accomplishments of the Hull-House residents\nsuffered because of the fame of their leader. Still, given the\nopportunity, each expressed their admiration and gratitude to Addams\nfor making Hull House the hotbed of ideas and action. Addams was the\nmost visible leader of a remarkable group of educated activists whose\nmutual respect allowed intellectual growth to flourish.\n\nFinally, a few other influences are worthy of mention. Although she\nwas not personally religious, Addams\u2019 Christian roots left their\nmark. Addams was exceptionally well versed in the Christian bible and\nhad attended several religious courses during her time at Rockford\nSeminary. Addams occasionally used religious language to help get her\nmessage out to Christian constituencies. Addams was also well\nacquainted with Greek philosophy and referenced Socrates, Plato, and\nAristotle in her work. Addams was attracted to the ability of Greek\nphilosophers to move between personal and social concerns rather than\ncompartmentalizing their philosophical analysis. Some have suggested\nthat Addams was influenced by Auguste Comte (1798\u20131857) and the\npositivists (Misheva 2019). Comte, who coined the term\n\u201csociology,\u201d believed sciences need their own logic drawn\nfrom experience rather than Descartes\u2019s a priori universal\nrationalism. Addams would have been attracted to his ideas about\nsocial progress and his development of a religion of humanity. Addams\nalso read a great deal of literature, which influenced her ideas\nconcerning culture and sometimes seeped into her analysis, as it does\nwhen she uses Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear to understand\nlabor-management relations. Although she did not believe that reading\nwas a substitute for direct experience, she did suggest more than once\nthat reading great works of fiction as a means of developing a\nsympathetic understanding.\n\nThe scholarship of philosopher Marilyn Fischer has revealed how\nsignificant social evolutionary thinking was for Addams. The\nOrigin of the Species was published in 1859, a year prior to\nAddams\u2019 birth. By the time Addams became a public intellectual,\nevolutionary thinking had not only become influential but was being\napplied to social phenomena as an explanatory narrative. Fischer\ndescribes, \u201cRecognizing Addams\u2019s use of social\nevolutionary discourse, set within imaginative forms, reveals the\nlogic and sensibility of her layered ethical analysis\u201d (Fischer\n2019, 13).\n\nAlthough Addams had a wide variety of influences, as we have seen, she\nwas not a derivative thinker, as many commentators suggest. She drew\nupon a number of great theorists to develop her ideas about social\nmorality but never dogmatically followed in anyone\u2019s footsteps.\nAll the while, she influenced many others as she made her unique\ncontributions to American and feminist philosophy.\n",
