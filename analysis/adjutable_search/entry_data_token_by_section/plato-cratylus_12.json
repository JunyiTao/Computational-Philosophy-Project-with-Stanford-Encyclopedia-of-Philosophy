Socrates is engaged in one form of\netymological research when he tries to uncover the etymological\nmeaning of names; Cratylus is engaged in a different (if not\nindependent) form of etymological research when he later derives\nclaims about the being of the referents of a name from conjectures\nabout its etymological meaning (435d\u2013440e; see\n section 9).\n Taking one\u2019s cue from Sedley\u2019s universally accepted\ndistinction between the exegetical and the philosophical correctness\nof etymological analyses (Sedley 2003: 28), one might thus say that\nSocrates practices exegetical etymology and Cratylus\nphilosophical etymology.\n\nThe etymological section illustrates vividly that philosophical\netymology is a nonstarter. For it shows that one would just take over\nthe Heraclitean opinions of the ancient lawgivers if one relied on\nphilosophical etymology\u2014and as Socrates himself points out,\nthese opinions are mistaken (411b\u2013c). While this much is\nacknowledged by all commentators, matters are more complicated when it\ncomes to exegetical etymology. Some commentators point out that many\nof Socrates\u2019 etymological analyses are obviously absurd, and\nthat he punctuates these analyses with ironical remarks about his\nunusually inspired state (see, e.g., 396c\u2013397a or 410e) and with\nreflections on the methodological pitfalls of etymological research\n(414c\u2013415a and 418a\u2013b); they conclude that the\netymological section must be read as a parody of exegetical etymology\n(see, e.g., Schleiermacher 1824: 5\u20139; Heitsch 1984: 51; and\nTrivigno 2012). But other commentators object that Socrates\u2019\netymological analyses will have seemed much less absurd to ancient\nreaders than they appear to modern readers, and downplay the\nsignificance of his intermittent meta-observations. In their view,\nPlato does not make fun of exegetical etymology, but puts forward\nclaims that are at least \u201cbon\u00e2 fide guesses\u201d (Grote\n1865: 526) about the etymological meaning of names (see, e.g., Grote\n1865: 518\u2013529; Sedley 1998 and 2003; and Ademollo 2011:\n237\u2013256).\n\nAs this scholarly dispute is still unresolved, it is very hard to say\nwhich point the etymological section is supposed to make about\nexegetical etymology. One plausible minimalist assumption would seem\nto be that Socrates\u2019 etymological analyses suggest that\nexegetical etymology is not a science and does not lead to true\nknowledge. There are, to be sure, commentators who reject even this\nminimalist assumption (Sedley 2003: 41\u201350). But since it is\ncompatible with both the idea that Socrates\u2019 analyses are\n\u201cbon\u00e2 fide guesses\u201d and the claim that these\nanalyses are meant to parody exegetical etymology, it might be\nacceptable to a solid majority among scholars.\n",
