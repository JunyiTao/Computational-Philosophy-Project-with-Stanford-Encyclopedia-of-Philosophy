Mental Computation\n\nModern proponents of LOTH typically endorse the\n computational theory of mind\n (CTM), which claims that the mind is a computational system. Some\nauthors use the phrase \u201clanguage of thought hypothesis\u201d so\nthat it definitionally includes CTM as one component.\n\nIn a seminal contribution, Turing (1936) introduced what is now called\nthe\n Turing machine:\n an abstract model of an idealized computing device. A Turing machine\ncontains a central processor, governed by precise mechanical rules,\nthat manipulates symbols inscribed along a linear array of memory\nlocations. Impressed by the enormous power of the Turing machine\nformalism, many researchers seek to construct computational models of\ncore mental processes, including reasoning, decision-making, and\nproblem solving. This enterprise bifurcates into two main branches.\nThe first branch is artificial intelligence (AI), which aims\nto build \u201cthinking machines\u201d. Here the goal is primarily\nan engineering one\u2014to build a system that instantiates or at\nleast simulates thought\u2014without any pretense at capturing how\nthe human mind works. The second branch, computational\npsychology, aims to construct computational models of human\nmental activity. AI and computational psychology both emerged in the\n1960s as crucial elements in the new interdisciplinary initiative\n cognitive science,\n which studies the mind by drawing upon psychology, computer science\n(especially AI), linguistics, philosophy, economics (especially game\ntheory and behavioral economics), anthropology, and neuroscience.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the early 1980s, computational models offered within\npsychology were mainly Turing-style models. These models embody a\nviewpoint known as the classical computational theory of mind\n(CCTM). According to CCTM, the mind is a computational system similar\nin important respects to a Turing machine, and certain core mental\nprocesses are computations similar in important respects to\ncomputations executed by a Turing machine.\n\nCCTM fits together nicely with RTT+COMP. Turing-style computation\noperates over symbols, so any Turing-style mental computations must\noperate over mental symbols. The essence of RTT+COMP is postulation of\nmental symbols. Fodor (1975, 1981) advocates RTT+COMP+CCTM. He holds\nthat certain core mental processes are Turing-style computations over\nMentalese expressions.\n\nOne can endorse RTT+COMP without endorsing CCTM. By positing a system\nof compositionally structured mental representations, one does not\ncommit oneself to saying that operations over the representations are\ncomputational. Historical LOT theorists could not even\nformulate CCTM, for the simple reason that the Turing formalism had\nnot been discovered. In the modern era, Harman (1973) and Sellars\n(1975) endorse something like RTT+COMP but not CCTM. Horgan and\nTienson (1996) endorse RTT+COMP+CTM but not CCTM, i.e.,\nclassical CTM. They favor a version of CTM grounded in\n connectionism,\n an alternative computational framework that differs quite\nsignificantly from Turing\u2019s approach. Thus, proponents of\nRTT+COMP need not accept that mental activity instantiates\nTuring-style computation.\n\nFodor (1981) combines RTT+COMP+CCTM with a view that one might call\nthe formal-syntactic conception of computation (FSC).\nAccording to FSC, computation manipulates symbols in virtue of their\nformal syntactic properties but not their semantic properties.\n\nFSC draws inspiration from modern logic, which emphasizes the\nformalization of deductive reasoning. To formalize, we\nspecify a formal language whose component linguistic\nexpressions are individuated non-semantically (e.g., by their\ngeometric shapes). We describe the expressions as pieces of formal\nsyntax, without considering what if anything the expressions mean. We\nthen specify inference rules in syntactic, non-semantic\nterms. Well-chosen inference rules will carry true premises to true\nconclusions. By combining formalization with Turing-style computation,\nwe can build a physical machine that manipulates symbols based solely\non the formal syntax of the symbols. If we program the machine to\nimplement appropriate inference rules, then its syntactic\nmanipulations will transform true premises into true conclusions.\n\nCCTM+FSC says that the mind is a formal syntactic computing system:\nmental activity consists in computation over symbols with formal\nsyntactic properties; computational transitions are sensitive to the\nsymbols\u2019 formal syntactic properties but not their semantic\nproperties. The key term \u201csensitive\u201d is rather imprecise,\nallowing some latitude as to the precise import of CCTM+FSC.\nIntuitively, the picture is that a mental symbol\u2019s formal syntax\nrather than its semantics determines how mental computation\nmanipulates it. The mind is a \u201csyntactic engine\u201d.\n\nFodor (1987: 18\u201320) argues that CCTM+FSC helps illuminate a\ncrucial feature of cognition: semantic coherence. For the\nmost part, our thinking does not move randomly from thought to\nthought. Rather, thoughts are causally connected in a way that\nrespects their semantics. For example, deductive inference carries\ntrue beliefs to true beliefs. More generally, thinking tends to\nrespect epistemic properties such as warrant and degree of\nconfirmation. In some sense, then, our thinking tends to cohere with\nsemantic relations among thoughts. How is semantic coherence achieved?\nHow does our thinking manage to track semantic properties? CCTM+FSC\ngives one possible answer. It shows how a physical system operating in\naccord with physical laws can execute computations that coherently\ntrack semantic properties. By treating the mind as a syntax-driven\nmachine, we explain how mental activity achieves semantic coherence.\nWe thereby answer the question: How is rationality mechanically\npossible?\n\nFodor\u2019s argument convinced many researchers that CCTM+FSC\ndecisively advances our understanding of the mind\u2019s relation to\nthe physical world. But not everyone agrees that CCTM+FSC adequately\nintegrates semantics into the causal order. A common worry is that the\nformal syntactic picture veers dangerously close to\nepiphenomenalism (Block 1990; Kazez 1994). Pre-theoretically,\nsemantic properties of mental states seem highly relevant to mental\nand behavioral outcomes. For example, if I form an intention to walk\nto the grocery store, then the fact that my intention concerns the\ngrocery store rather than the post office helps explain why I walk to\nthe grocery store rather than the post office. Burge (2010) and\nPeacocke (1994) argue that cognitive science theorizing likewise\nassigns causal and explanatory importance to semantic properties. The\nworry is that CCTM+FSC cannot accommodate the causal and explanatory\nimportance of semantic properties because it depicts them as causally\nirrelevant: formal syntax, not semantics, drives mental computation\nforward. Semantics looks epiphenomenal, with syntax doing all the work\n(Stich 1983).\n\nFodor (1990, 1994) expends considerable energy trying to allay\nepiphenomenalist worries. Advancing a detailed theory of the relation\nbetween Mentalese syntax and Mentalese semantics, he insists that FSC\ncan honor the causal and explanatory relevance of semantic properties.\nFodor\u2019s treatment is widely regarded as problematic (Arjo 1996;\nAydede 1997b, 1998; Aydede & Robbins 2001; Perry 1998; Prinz 2011;\nWakefield 2002), although Rupert (2008) and Schneider (2005) espouse\nsomewhat similar positions.\n\nPartly in response to epiphenomenalist worries, some authors recommend\nthat we replace FSC with an alternative semantic conception\nof computation (Block 1990; Burge 2010: 95\u2013101; Figdor 2009;\nO\u2019Brien & Opie 2006; Peacocke 1994, 1999; Rescorla 2012a).\nSemantic computationalists claim that computational transitions are\nsometimes sensitive to semantic properties, perhaps in addition to\nsyntactic properties. More specifically, semantic computationalists\ninsist that mental computation is sometimes sensitive to\nsemantics. Thus, they reject any suggestion that the mind is a\n\u201csyntactic engine\u201d or that mental computation is sensitive\nonly to formal\n syntax.[6]\n To illustrate, consider Mentalese conjunction. This mental symbol\nexpresses the truth-table for conjunction. According to semantic\ncomputationalists, the symbol\u2019s meaning is relevant (both\ncausally and explanatorily) to mechanical operations over it. That the\nsymbol expresses the truth-table for conjunction rather than, say,\ndisjunction influences the course of computation. We should therefore\nreject any suggestion that mental computation is sensitive to the\nsymbol\u2019s syntactic properties rather than its semantic\nproperties. The claim is not that mental computation explicitly\nrepresents semantic properties of mental symbols. All parties\nagree that, in general, it does not. There is no homunculus inside\nyour head interpreting your mental language. The claim is rather that\nsemantic properties influence how mental computation proceeds.\n(Compare: the momentum of a baseball thrown at a window causally\ninfluences whether the window breaks, even though the window does not\nexplicitly represent the baseball\u2019s momentum.)\n\nProponents of the semantic conception differ as to how exactly they\ngloss the core claim that some computations are\n\u201csensitive\u201d to semantic properties. They also differ in\ntheir stance towards CCTM. Block (1990) and Rescorla (2014a) focus\nupon CCTM. They argue that a symbol\u2019s semantic properties can\nimpact mechanical operations executed by a Turing-style computational\nsystem. In contrast, O\u2019Brien and Opie (2006) favor connectionism\nover CCTM.\n\nTheorists who reject FSC must reject Fodor\u2019s explanation of\nsemantic coherence. What alternative explanation might they offer? So\nfar, the question has received relatively little attention. Rescorla\n(2017a) argues that semantic computationalists can explain semantic\ncoherence and simultaneously avoid epiphenomenalist worries by\ninvoking neural implementation of semantically-sensitive mental\ncomputations.\n\nFodor\u2019s exposition sometimes suggests that CTM, CCTM, or\nCCTM+FSC is definitive of LOTH (1981: 26). Yet not everyone who\nendorses RTT+COMP endorses CTM, CCTM, or FSC. One can postulate a\nmental language without agreeing that mental activity is\ncomputational, and one can postulate mental computations over a mental\nlanguage without agreeing that the computations are sensitive only to\nsyntactic properties. For most purposes, it is not important whether\nwe regard CTM, CCTM, or CCTM+FSC as definitive of LOTH. More important\nis that we track the distinctions among the doctrines.\n",
