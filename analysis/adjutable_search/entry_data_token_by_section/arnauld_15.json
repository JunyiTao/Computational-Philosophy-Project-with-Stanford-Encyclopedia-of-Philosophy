According to\nBa\u00f1ez, efficacious grace is the supernatural counterpart of\n\u201cphysical premotion.\u201d The elusive notion of physical\npremotion is part of a general account of God\u2019s causation of the\nactions of creatures. According to this account, God is a cause of a\ncreature\u2019s action by bringing about in the creature a\n\u201cpremotion\u201d that results in the creature\u2019s carrying\nout the action in question. For Ba\u00f1ez, then, the actual grace\nin question is a sort of supernatural beginning of volition that is\nproduced in the human being by God and that infallibly results in a\nmeritorious act of will. Jansen rejected this notion, arguing that it\nis an obscure hypothesis that explains nothing. He held that\nefficacious grace is, instead, a feeling of love, which he called a\n\u201cdelectatio victrix (victorious pleasure)\u201d and\nwhich infallibly leads to a meritorious act.\n\nArnauld accepted neither of those views. In a work published in 1656,\nhe considers two positions on the nature of efficacious grace, in so\nfar as it is the principle of good will: \u201cSome say that such\ngrace consists in the mercy of God and in an inherent form [in the\ncreature],\u201d while others say that it consists \u201conly in the\nmercy of God, which brings about (operatur) the interior\nmovement of the mind.\u201d Arnauld says \u201cI am not far\u201d\nfrom the second position, which he attributes to \u201cBradwardine,\nEstius, Tiphanius, and many other [Thomists]\u201d (Dissertatio\ntheologica quadripartita, OA, 20:237).\n\nWhen Arnauld returned to questions about efficacious grace and free\nwill toward the end of his life, he was more categorical:\n\nThe true opinion of St. Augustine, St. Bernard, and St. Thomas\nconcerning actual grace, is that of Estius, who posits nothing created\nby God in the will in between the will of God, which he calls\nuncreated grace, and the free movement of the human will which the\nuncreated grace produces in the human will.\n\n\nJansen was \u201csurely mistaken,\u201d Arnauld adds, when he\ndefined actual grace as a non-deliberate \u201cvictorious\npleasure\u201d (Letter to du Vaucel, 8 May 1693, OA,\n 3:636).[33]\n In a short treatise on human freedom written almost a decade earlier,\nArnauld illustrates his criticism of Jansen (without mentioning him by\nname) with an example: \u201cSuppose that a man who is not very\ngenerous is approached by a beggar who asks him for alms. He\ndeliberates, proposes to himself the commandment of Christ, and gives\nalms for the sake of God\u201d (De la libert\u00e9 de\nl\u2019homme, OA, 10:620, hereinafter\nLibert\u00e9). Jansen assumes that there is a\nnon-deliberate act of victorious pleasure in between the man\u2019s\ndeliberation and his decision to give alms for the sake of God, and\nthat this non-deliberate pleasure is the actual grace that enables him\nto act in a meritorious way. Arnauld rejects this position and instead\nidentifies the efficacious grace with God\u2019s merciful will that\nthe man arrive at the deliberate decision to give alms for the sake of\nGod.\n\nYet Arnauld also assumed that the man\u2019s decision, like any\nmeritorious act of will, was free. Arnauld\u2019s basic position on\nthe compatibility of the intrinsic efficacy of grace with the freedom\nof the volitions produced by the grace, is that we know from Scripture\nand Tradition, supported by philosophical reflection on God\u2019s\nomnipotence (a) that the grace of Christ is intrinsically efficacious;\nand we know \u201cfrom our own experience\u201d (b) that our\nvolitions of the relevant kind are free. Hence we know that (a) and\n(b) are consistent, even though we have \u201cgreat difficulty\u201d\nin seeing how they fit together (OA, 10:436).\n",
