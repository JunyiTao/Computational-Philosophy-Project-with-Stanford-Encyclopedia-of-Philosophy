Winning the game\n\nIf we look at obligational disputations from the modern logical point\nof view, it may appear hard to understand how the sequence of answers\nshould be understood. One tempting alternative would be to think that\nthe idea would be to describe a counterfactual situation. As pointed\nout above, this may be what Kilvington and the anonymous author were\naiming at. (See also Spade 1982, 1992, and 1993.) However, the\nmainstream of medieval authors writing on obligations did not accept\ntheir approach.\n\nThe mainstream understanding of the current research into the\nobligations treatises seems to emphasize in different ways that\naccording to the standard approach (exemplified here by Burley\u2019s\nrules) the set of all answers will be consistent. Thus, it may seem\nreasonable to understand obligational disputations as a kind of\nconsistency maintenance game. Given that in modern logic the concept\nof a possible world is often understood in terms of what a potentially\ninfinite consistent set of sentences describes, the sequence of\nanswers in an obligational disputation can perhaps be interpreted as\nan expanding description of a possible world.\n\nThe problem with this interpretation is that it does not fit\nSwyneshed\u2019s rules, which were accepted by some authors as a\nviable alternative to Burley\u2019s approach. As the rules stand, the\nset of all answers cannot be understood as a description of a possible\nworld, because it need not be consistent. The set of answers to\nrelevant propositions is consistent even according to\nSwyneshed\u2019s rules, but understanding that set as describing a\npossible world runs into the difficulty that that set does not expand\nfrom the logical closure of the positum, and thus it does not\ndescribe any possible world more fully than the positum\nalone.\n\nA crucial feature of the Socratic elenchus is that the\nanswerer is led to deny what has already been granted. Avoiding it to\nhappen that the respondent denies the positum is a central\nobjective in an obligational disputation, and Burley\u2019s rules\nappear to require that this objective is achieved through a consistent\nsequence of answers. Swyneshed allows contradictory triads. In other\nwords, the set of answers may become inconsistent but the respondent\nis not allowed to grant any \u201ccontradictory incompatible with the\npositum\u201d (Spade 1977, 274). It appears that even in\nSwyneshed\u2019s case a crucial interest is to explicate logical\nrelations between the propositions put forward by the opponent, and\nespecially as they relate to the positum. As a general\ndescription of what obligational disputations were about, consistency\nmay not be exactly the right word. Perhaps it would be more exact to\ndescribe obligations as aiming at a dynamic understanding of logical\nrelations within a set of propositions.\n\nThe square of opposition was an important tool in Aristotelian logic\nfor understanding contradiction and other relations between pairs of\nassertoric predicative propositions formed with the same categorematic\nterms. As has been recognized, John Buridan and other logicians\nexpanded this theory to the octagon of opposition to cover also modal\npropositions. Obligational disputations can be understood as an\nexpansion into another direction. An obligational disputation\nabstracts from the predication as the standard form of proposition and\nturns from the binary logical relations into examining logical\nrelations within a dynamically constructed sequence of propositions.\n(Cf. especially Dutilh Novaes 2005; 2007; 2011; Dutilh Novaes and\nUckelman 2016; Strobino 2011; Uckelman 2013; Yrj\u00f6nsuuri 2000;\n2015.)\n\nIn his discussion of obligationes from the very end of the\nfourteenth century, Paul of Venice compares obligations with another\ngenre of logic, saying that \u201cthe matter of obligations is only\nthe matter of consequences in a more subtle style\u201d (Paul of\nVenice in Ashworth 1988, 32). One aspect of what Paul of Venice means\nby this statement is presumably that both obligations and consequences\nare concerned with non-syllogistic logic. To this extent, this\ndescription of the theory of obligationes seems correct even\nfrom the modern vantage point. However, it does not seem quite right\nto think that an obligational disputation would try to spell out the\nlogical relation between an antecedent and a consequent, or even a set\nof premises and a conclusion. The logical relations considered in an\nobligational disputation are not distinctively binary. It seems that\nthey are often approached as logical relations becoming explicit only\nin a dynamic sequence of three or more propositions.\n",
