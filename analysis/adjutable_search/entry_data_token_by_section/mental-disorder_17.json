    "main_text": "Values and Mental Disorder || Evaluativism (Normativism) and Objectivism (Naturalism)\n8.1 Evaluativism (Normativism) and Objectivism (Naturalism)\n\nPresent day conceptions, classifications, and attributions of mental\ndisorder contain many values, some explicit, others implicit, some\nmoral, others non-moral. Unacceptable bias has been repeatedly\nidentified, exemplified in categories such as homosexuality (with its\nhomophobia), pre-menstrual syndrome (unwarrantedly assigning disorder\nstatus to normal function), masochistic personality disorder\n(pathologizing misogynist gender roles), and oppositional defiant\nconduct disorders (exhibiting racial bias) (Sadler 2005, 2013; Potter\n2014; Poland 2014, Gagn\u00e9-Julien). As in all medicine, the\nprefixes of \u201cillness\u201dand \u201cdisorder,\u201d like\n\u201cdisease,\u201d already declare values such as the preference\nfor health over ill-health. A theory of values based medicine (VBM)\nemphasizes that values over mental health are particularly\ncontentious, requiring distinctive forms of negotiation in clinical\npractice (Fulford 2004, 2014).\n\nThe central philosophical question is whether moral values are\ninescapably attached to the conceptualization and classification of\nmental disorders at the level of theorizing, forming an inherent part\nof their definition. Such \u201cevaluativism\u201d\n(\u201cnormativism\u201d, or \u201cconstructivism\u201d) is placed\nin contrast to \u201cobjectivism\u201d (\u201cnaturalism\u201d),\nwhich seeks a value-free account of mental disorder. Debates over\nthese questions have long dominated philosophical research on mental\ndisorder, many played out around attempts to define mental disorder in\nways that are value-free (see\n \u00a74).\n\nAs was shown\n (\u00a74.4),\n philosophical definitions aiming to avoid all values appeal to\nallegedly value-neutral statistical norms, and adaptive function,\nrespectively. The vulnerability in Boorse\u2019s (1997) statistical\ndefinition, where normal function is determined according to the\nperson\u2019s reference class identified by such criteria as age, and\nsex, lies both with assigning the appropriate reference class, a\nprocess that re-introduces values, and at the point on a continuous\ndistribution curve where deviance from the mean is granted the status\nof dysfunctional (Bolton 2008). Recognizing that a trait may be\ndysfunctional in evolutionary terms without being disvalued, and\ndisvalued without being evidence of dysfunction, Wakefield\u2019s\ntwo-part definition explicitly accommodates the evaluative element\nmarking the category. This attempt to provide a naturalistic and value\nfree evolution-based account of \u201cfunction\u201d and\n\u201cdysfunction\u201d has been subject to a range of damaging\nobjections, including the claim that with its preference for\nevolutionary fitness, biological dysfunction is not, as promised,\nvalue neutral, even in the first half of the definition. Discerning\nwhat would be the maximal response in terms of perpetuating the\nspecies represents another of these objections, since no agreed-upon\nconclusion about this can be drawn in a value-neutral, or perhaps any,\nway. (See Murphy & Stich 2000; Faucher & Forest 2021; Garson\n2022.) Critiques of more general disease definitions are also\napplicable mental disorder. (See Powell & Scarffe 2019.)\n\nEvaluativism and objectivism are customarily depicted as incompatible\ncontraries, although the different domains where claims about disorder\noccur (including ordinary usage; conceptually clean versions of\n\u201chealth\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d; the operationalization\nof dysfunction, and the justification for that operationalization),\nindicate need for a more nuanced analysis of the role of values in\nhealth and disease (Kingma 2014). The broad contrast between\nevaluativism and objectivism has also been resisted for other reasons.\nJudgments about mental disorder need not be entirely arbitrary and\nsubjective as long as those values are taken to be real features of\nthe world along the lines of McDowell\u2019s secondary property value\nrealism, for example. In this relaxed naturalism, objectivism merely\nmeans requiring no special subject for the disciplining, conception,\nand framing of judgments, and providing a contrast between correct and\nincorrect, or truth and falsity, for the relevant judgments (Thornton\n2007).\n",
