    "main_text": "Looking Ahead: New Challenges and Opportunities || Reticulation & Discordance\n3.2 Impacts on Phylogenetic Inference\n\nThe reticulation and genealogical discordance generated by\nhybridization, HGT, ILS, and other complexities stemming from the\nstructure and processes involving biological lineages have,\nhistorically, been obscured by idealizing assumptions in\nphylogenetics. In many cases treating phylogenetic trees as idealized\nmodels of genealogical history is useful and appropriate for the\nresearch question at hand.\n Figure 1\n offers a good example of this. This reflects how the level of\nresolution relative to our research questions can drive the way we use\nphylogenetic tools (O\u2019Hara 1993).\n\nBut what happens when these idealizing assumptions are critically\ninterrogated? First, the fact that different entities have different,\noften incompatible, genealogical histories brings into question the\nvery nature of phylogeny. One line of thought is that a phylogeny\nshould directly track genetic history rather than the history of\nspeciation. As Maddison (1995: 285) puts it,\n\n\none possible interpretation of a species phylogeny is that it depicts\nthe lines by which genetic information was passed on and nothing\nmore.\n\n\nBaum and Shaw (1995), Baum (2007), and Velasco (2010, 2019) represent\na series of papers devoted to developing this \u201cconcordance\ntree\u201d idea. Baum (2009) incorporates this line of thought about\nphylogenetic history into the debate over the nature of species and\nother taxa.\n\nPhilosophers have paid particular attention to reticulation in the\ncontext of microbial genomics, and for good reason (O\u2019Malley et\nal. 2010 is a notable special edition dedicated to this topic and is a\nuseful resource). These are often framed as challenges to the\nphylogenetic approach itself, or, in other cases, how and whether the\ntools of phylogenetics apply to microbial genomics (Martin 1999;\nDoolittle 1999). The breadth of HGT in microbial systems has also led\nto challenges to the more conceptual and metaphysical commitments\nabout species and other phylogenetic units (Franklin 2007).\n\nHowever, the majority of work in phylogenetics today continues with\nthe same goals as before, but with biologists using better and more\npowerful tools for incorporating these complexities into their\nphylogenetic models. Haber (2019) offers a philosophical treatment of\nhow reticulation and genealogical discordance introduces both\nchallenges and opportunities in the context of phylogenetic inference,\nasking whether the branches of phylogenetic trees are \u201ctoo\nthin\u201d and obscure relevant details found in the internal\nstructure of those lineages. There are a lot of good reasons\nphylogeneticists might aim to include reticulate structure in their\nphylogenetic reconstructions. Among other things, it means treating\ngenealogical discordance as data that can be mined, as opposed to\nnoise that needs to be filtered out (Haber 2012, 2019). Philosophers\nhave begun paying more attention to ways that reticulation and\ndiscordance have impacted phylogenetic inference beyond microbial\ngenomics. Rather than coming as challenges from cognate fields, these\ninclude ways that practicing phylogeneticists have sought to account\nfor and accommodate what we have come to understand about reticulation\nand discordance (see Haber & Molter 2019 for a special issue\ndedicated to this topic).\n\nPopulation biologists were among the first to operationalize methods\nfor extracting information about the history of lineages from the\ninternal structure of those lineages, i.e., by examining the structure\nof individuals in a populations, population biologists developed\nmethods for inferring historical coalescent points of those\nindividuals (Hudson 1983; Kingman 1982, 2000; Tajima 1983). These\nmethods exploit the fact that after a lineage splits it takes time for\nthat split to be wholly reflected in the kinship relations of the\nparts of those lineages. Or, to put it in more familiar terms, it\ntakes time for the parts of a lineage to all be more closely related\nto each other than any are to parts in other lineages These approaches\ncan be viewed as the continued development of methods in the larger\ncontext of the close ties between the application of statistical tools\nand molecular biology\n (\u00a71.2.3).\n\nMaddison (1997) represents a more recent launching point for a new\nappreciation of the role that the internal structure of lineages can\nplay in phylogenetic inference. Briefly, the continued advancement of\nmolecular and computational techniques provided the opportunity to\nproduce ever-finely resolved phylogenies of the systems of interest.\nWhat quickly became apparent was a confirmation of what is only\nimplicit in Hennig (1966): that the hierarchical structure of taxa may\nresult in discordant phylogenies at different levels (or even within\nlevels) of the biological hierarchy. As an example, Maddison describes\nhow the phylogenies of individual genes or nucleotides may display\ndifferent phylogenetic topographies from the organisms or populations\nin which we sampled those genes. This is not a result of error or\nhomoplasy, but of genuine phylogenetic discordance between gene level\nlineages and the higher-level lineages in which they reside.\n\nMaddison (1997) is also directly about how we ought to incorporate\nwhat we learn about the internal structure of lineages into our models\nof phylogenetic inference, and how we might build on the earlier work\non coalescent models. Maddison is among the first to deeply appreciate\nhow impactful the then-new work on genomics might be for\nphylogenetics, both in the ways that discordance will present serious\nchallenges and opportunities for phylogenetic inference. This has\nhelped spur new developments in this field of phylogenetics, (e.g.,\nMaddison & Knowles 2006; Degnan & Rosenberg 2006, 2009; Baum\n2007; Nakhleh 2013; Hahn & Nakhleh 2016; Mallet, Besansky, &\nHahn 2016).\n\nHaber (2019) offers two reasons why these new developments in\nphylogenetic inference should be of interest to philosophers. First,\nhe offers a real-time example of scientists shifting from treating a\nfeature of a system as noise to recognizing it as powerful evidence.\nPease et al. (2016) is a prime example of this. They use some of the\nnew tools developed to draw phylogenetic inference in highly\ndiscordant systems to offer a reconstruction of the tomato clade.\nWhere earlier analyses regarded the system as too noisy to pull out a\nstrong phylogenetic signal, these new models permitted a\nreconstruction that recognized specific patterns of discordance. This\nrepresents a substantial advancement in the level of resolution\nphylogeneticists are able to reconstruct and identify.\n\nSecond, the new attitudes toward discordance and reticulation in\nphylogenetics provide an example of a community of scientists shifting\nfrom one set of commitments to another. Haber (2019) offers a specific\nexample. He describes one of the entrenched core commitments in\nphylogenetic methodology as being the goal of \u201cresolving\u201d\ncompeting phylogenetic trees (Felsenstein 1988). That is, in cases\nwhere different analyses or data are generating conflicting\nphylogenetic trees, the goal should be to resolve this conflict by\nidentifying which of those trees is best supported. On a model that\nrecognizes genealogical discordance, though, conflicting trees may\naccurately reflect a reticulate or discordant phylogenetic history,\ne.g., if different data strongly support different phylogenetic trees,\none possible explanation is that we have discovered an instance of\ndiscordance. Nakhleh (2013) recommends that this entails that\nphylogeneticists must now also consider whether conflicting trees may\nbe \u201creconciled\u201d rather than resolved. Haber (2019) argues\nthat this is an example of what he calls a \u201cproductive\ndisruption\u201d, which is one way that science might advance.\n\nThe conceptual and epistemological impacts of discordance on\nphylogenetic inference come together in recent debates over Sukumaran\nand Knowles\u2019 (2017) work and commentary on the multispecies\ncoalescent (Rannala & Yang 2003; Yang & Rannala 2010). Very\nroughly, the multispecies coalescent extends the principle of the\ncoalescent from population genetics to phylogenetics. In population\ngenetics, a gene can be sampled from multiple individuals in a single\npopulation; coalescent theory provides a way to model the ancestral\nhistory of that gene to a common ancestor, i.e., where that history\ncoalesces. The multispecies coalescent does something similar, but\nwith samples from multiple populations (or even species). These and\nother techniques were developed in response to the challenge posed by\nMaddison (1997) to develop methods that recognize speciation as an\nextended process. Roughly, the lineages of genes, individual\norganisms, populations, and species within a taxa can all \u201ccome\napart\u201d, or have different phylogenetic histories, and display\n\u201ca fractal hierarchy of divergences\u201d (Sukumaran &\nKnowles 2017: 1607). Multispecies coalescent techniques help reveal\nthe fine-grained structure of complex multi-level lineages (Haber\n2012), which has generated discussion on how these internal lineage\nstructures relate to species delimitation and other phylogenetic\ninferences (e.g., de Queiroz 2007; Knowles & Carstens 2007; Haber\n2012; Carstens, Pelletier, Reid, & Satler 2013; Hahn & Nakhleh\n2016; Mallet et al. 2016; Velasco 2019).\n\nSukumaran and Knowles (2017) provide a good example of the discussions\nover what kinds of inferences are licensed by the multispecies\ncoalescent, and the way that metaphysical concerns overlap with\nepistemological ones. They focus on what kinds of inferences may be\ndrawn from multispecies coalescent methods, arguing that it is a\nmistake to simply treat the units identified by these methods as\nspecies, when they may turn out to be population-level structures\ninstead (i.e., populations of a species, rather than distinct\nspecies). They seek to highlight that mistaking population structures\nfor species (or too quickly drawing the inference of the latter from\nthe former, without further evidence), can undermine precisely the\nsorts of inferences that phylogenetics seeks to license by\nartificially and unjustifiably inflating species counts:\n\n\nSpecifically, all fields that rely on species as units of analysis,\nfrom conservation biology to studies of macroevolutionary dynamics,\nwill be impacted by inflated estimates of the number of species,\nespecially as genomic resources provide unprecedented power for\ndetecting increasingly finer-scaled genetic structure under the\nmultispecies coalescent. (Sukumaran & Knowles 2017: 1607)\n\n\nThis may be framed as a claim about the units of divergence and\ndiversification being identified by these multispecies coalescent\nmethods (a metaphysical claim), and the sorts of inferences that may\nbe drawn about those units from these methods (an epistemological\nclaim) (Haber 2019).\n\nTo be clear, the relation between the metaphysics and epistemology is\nnot direct, but oblique, yet important in regard to the inferences\nlicensed by phylogenetic methods. Sukumaran and Knowles (2017), for\nexample, conclude by issuing a plea for phylogeneticists to exercise a\nmore careful stance towards relying on genomic data alone, and in\nusing multispecies coalescent as a straight-forward way to identify\nspecies. They instead propose a more cautious inferential stance,\nidentifying the units identified by the multispecies coalescent as\npopulation-level structures (which may or may not correspond to\nspecies delimitation). This is merely an example of the rich sorts of\ndiscussions around good scientific inference that is available to\nphilosophers willing to dive into this literature.\n",
