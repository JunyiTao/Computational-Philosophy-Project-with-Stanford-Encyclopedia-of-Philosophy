    "main_text": "Speech Time, Event Time and Reference Time\n3. Speech Time, Event Time and Reference Time\n\nThe notions speech time, event time, and\n\nreference time were introduced by Reichenbach (1947) in order\nto distinguish simple past and present perfect or, more generally,\nabsolute and relative tense. According to Comrie (1985), who refined\nReichenbach\u2019s system (in Chapter 6 of his book on tense) speech time\nand event time are sufficient for the analysis of absolute\ntime; i.e., present, (simple) past and future. But for\nrelative tense\u2014of which the present perfect is but one\nexample\u2014reference time is required. Let us explain these notions\nby applying them to distinguish between past and present perfect. \n\nConsider the following examples from Steedman (1997). \n7.\n\n(a)\n\nI have lost my watch.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nYesterday, I lost my watch.\n      \n\n\nIt has often been observed that the present perfect in English has\npresent relevance. For instance the continuation of (7a) with but\nI have found it again is infelicitous in English; the German\ntranslation of this sequence is acceptable, showing that the German\nperfect is more like a past tense (but see Kamp et al. 2015 for an\nextensive discussion, in Other Internet Resources). The same\ncontinuation is fine for sentence (7b). In this sense the perfect is a\nrelative tense and the past an absolute tense in English. Let \\(E\\)\nbe short for event time and let \\(S, R\\) stand for speech\ntime and reference time respectively. \n\n\nSimple Past \nPresent Perfect  \n\nI saw John  \nI have seen John \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the simple past, both event time and reference time are situated\non the time line before speech time. In case of the perfect, R and S\nare simultaneous and E is earlier than both R and S. Intuitively,\nreference time represents the perspective from which an eventuality is\nperceived on the time line. This is not a purely semantic theory of\ntense like temporal logic, rather it is a pragmatic theory of tense.\nIn particular, reference time (in contrast to event time) has to be\nmutually known by communication partners. When using the present\nperfect, reference time is known since it coincides with speech time.\nHowever, reference time is not necessarily known when the past tense\nis used, since it is just required to be earlier than speech time and\nto coincide with event time. This may explain why sentences in the\npast sound strange when uttered out of the blue. Steedman (1997)\npresents the following examples: \n8.\n\n(a)\n\n*Chapman breathed a sign of relief.\n      \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\nWhen Nixon was elected, Chapman breathed a sigh of relief.\n      \n\n\nThe past-tensed sentence (8a) uttered out of the blue is infelicitous,\nwhile sentence (8b) is fine, since in this case the\nwhen-clause introduces the reference time.\n\nThis is by no means the complete story of the perfect. For example,\nComrie (1976) distinguishes four typical uses of the perfect: the\nperfect of result, the experiential perfect, the perfect of persistent\nsituation and the perfect of recent past. For an extensive recent\ndiscussion the reader is advised to consult Kamp et al. 2015 (in Other\nInternet Resources). \n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions of event time, reference\ntime and speech time for other tenses: \n\nTable 2.\n\nE, R, S \nSam is working.  \n\nS \u2014 E, R \nSam will work.  \n\nE, R \u2014 S \nSam worked.  \n\nE \u2014 R \u2014 S\nSam had worked.  \n\nS \u2014 E \u2014 R\nSam will have worked. \n\nR \u2014 E \u2014 S\nSam would work.  \n\n\nComrie (1985) and Gamut (1991) point out that this cannot be a\ncomplete account for temporal constructions that occur in natural\nlanguages. For instance the temporal profile of the sentence Sam\nwould have worked cannot be analyzed by using a single reference\ntime. This is one reason for the extended requirements for a formal\ntheory of tense proposed by Comrie (1985: chapter 6). Furthermore, \nBlackburn and J\u00f8rgensen (2016) combine the key insights of Prior \nand Reichenbach in the framework of hybrid tense logic suggesting that \nthe two approaches are fully compatible with each other.\n",
