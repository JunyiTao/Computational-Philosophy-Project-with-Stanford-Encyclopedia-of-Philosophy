    "main_text": "Levels and downward causation\n5. Levels and downward causation\n\nLevels of organization have traditionally provided the framework for\nthe debate on downward causation, where the question is whether\nhigher-level entities or properties can exert causal influence on\nlower-level ones (e.g., Bechtel 2008; Campbell 1974; Emmeche et al.\n1997; 2000; Kim 1992; 1999; Craver & Bechtel 2007). The idea of\ndownward causation is closely connected to emergentism, and is often\nseen as one of its core tenets (Emmeche et al. 1997; 2000; Kim 1999;\nsee also the entry\n Emergent Properties).\n Examples of putative downward causation include psychological states\ncausing physical behavior, the activity of an organism causing changes\nin the tissues and cells of that organism, and cell-level processes\nsuch as synaptic communication causing molecular changes. On the one\nhand, downward causation seems prima facie to be common or\neven ubiquitous in experiments and explanations in the life sciences,\nand many scientists and philosophers consider it to be an important\nfeature of nature (Campbell 1974; Ellis 2008; Love 2012; Noble 2012).\nOn the other hand, in philosophy downward causation has often been\napproached with skepticism (e.g., McLaughlin 1992; Kim 1992; 1999;\n2005; Craver & Bechtel 2007).\n\nAlthough the discussion on downward causation relies heavily on the\nnotion of levels, this notion itself has not received much explicit\nattention in this context. However, to what extent downward causation\nis possible or plausible crucially depends on what notion of levels is\nassumed (Eronen 2021). Most of the critics of downward causation have\nin mind causation across compositional levels, where a whole\nexerts causal influence on its own parts. This is also what is at\nstake in the influential discussion of Craver and Bechtel, who apply\nthe framework of levels of mechanisms to analyze top-down causation\n(Bechtel 2008; Craver & Bechtel 2007; Craver 2015).\n\nCraver and Bechtel argue that genuine top-down or downward causation\ndoes not exist; there are just normal same-level causal relationships\nthat sometimes have \u201cmechanistically mediated\u201d effects\ndownward in the mechanism. What is meant by \u201cmechanistically\nmediated\u201d is that changes in the higher levels of the mechanism\nimmediately result in changes in the lower levels of the mechanisms\ndue to the constitutive relationship between the higher-level\nmechanism and its lower-level components. Mechanistically mediated\neffects may have the initial appearance of downward causation, but the\nrelationship between the mechanism and its components is constitutive,\nnot causal, and therefore mechanistically mediated effects are not\ncausal.\n\nTo clarify this, consider the example of Hal\u2019s glucose\nmetabolism (Craver & Bechtel 2007: 559\u2013560). Hal is playing\ntennis, and as he keeps running around and swinging the racket, the\ncells in Hal\u2019s body start taking in and using more glucose. It\nseems that the cause of the increase in Hal\u2019s glucose metabolism\nat the cellular level is Hal playing tennis, which suggests causation\nfrom a higher level (the level of the whole organism playing tennis)\nto a lower level (the cellular level). However, according to Craver\nand Bechtel, this would violate one central assumption regarding\ncausation, namely that causes must be distinct from their effects, and\nmust occur prior to the effects. Instead, they see this as just\nregular same-level causal relationships at the cellular level: Nerve\nsignals to the muscle cells cause a cascade of events that results in\nincreased glucose metabolism. Hal\u2019s tennis playing activity is\npartly constituted by these cellular mechanisms, and this\nconstitutive relationship is responsible for the appearance of\ndownward causation. As Hal starts to play, there are changes in these\nmechanisms, but only in virtue of them partly making up the tennis\nplaying activity.\n\nThis approach is appealing, but faces several challenges. First, it\nhas been argued that there are no clear methods of distinguishing\nbetween causal and constitutive relationships in mechanisms (e.g.,\nLeuridan 2011); if this is correct, there seems to be no reason to\nposit that \u201cmechanistically mediated\u201d effects are\nnon-causal. Second, the idea of \u201cnormal\u201d intralevel\ncausation is problematic in the framework of levels of mechanisms. As\nwe have seen in\n section 2.2,\n the idea of \u201cbeing at the same level\u201d has little if any\nsignificance in this framework, so same-level causation cannot be the\ndefault or normal type of causation. The idea seems to be rather that\nthere is no causation from a mechanism as a whole to the components of\nthat same mechanism, but this is just one very specific form of\ndownward causation, and how other forms should be treated is left open\nin this account (Eronen 2013). Third, it is not clear whether\nhigher-level causal processes in mechanisms can be distinct from\ncausal processes at lower levels of the mechanism\u2014if not, there\nare no higher-level causal processes that could have mechanistically\nmediated effects downwards in the mechanism to begin with (Fazekas\n& Kert\u00e9sz 2011; see also Fazekas 2022; Craver et al.\n2021).\n\nAlthough levels of mechanisms have been prominent in recent\nphilosophical discussions, a far more common way of approaching\ndownward causation in the biological literature has been to explicate\nit in terms of higher-level constraints or boundary\nconditions. The idea is that the behavior of lower-level things is\nconstrained by the higher-level whole that they are a part of, and\ntherefore explaining the behavior of these lower-level things is not\npossible exclusively at the lower level, but requires appealing to\nhigher-level factors (e.g., Bishop 2008; Campbell 1974; Ellis 2008;\nEmmeche et al. 1997; 2000; Green 2018; 2021; Kistler 2009; Noble 2012;\nPattee 1973; Sperry 1969). In a classic article, Donald Campbell\nexpressed this idea as follows: \u201cprocesses at the lower levels\nof a hierarchy are restrained by and act in conformity to the laws of\nthe higher level\u201d (Campbell 1974: 180). For example, according\nto Noble (2012), the higher-level cellular property of membrane\npotential constrains the activity of ion channels at a lower level,\nand this amounts to downward causation. Similarly, Green (2018; 2021)\nargues that properties of tissue structure (e.g., resistance) set\nboundary conditions for the propagation of action potentials,\nresulting in a form of downward causation.\n\nThese cases do not seem to involve causation across compositional\nlevels, that is, causation from a whole to its own parts: for\ninstance, the membrane potential and the ion channels do not stand in\na part-whole relationship (Woodward 2021). Instead, the underlying\nnotion of levels seems more akin to scales (as is also explicitly\nstated by Noble 2012 and Green 2021). More generally, Woodward (2021)\nhas argued that (downward) causation should not be seen as involving\nthings (such as wholes and their parts) as relata, but rather\nvariables, such as a variable representing the membrane potential, and\na variable representing whether an ion channel is open or closed. When\ndownward causation and levels are understood in this way, the worry\nthat the causes are not sufficiently distinct from their effects in\ndownward causation seems to dissolve, as the higher-level variables\n(e.g., membrane potential at a higher scale) are clearly distinct from\nthe lower-level effect variables (e.g., the ion channels at a lower\nscale; see Woodward 2021 for more). One unsettled question is\nwhether all putative cases of downward causation involve\ncausation in a substantial sense, or whether it would be more\nappropriate to designate, for example, constraints or boundary\nconditions as some form of downward determination or explanation (see,\ne.g., Hulswit 2005). Another remaining problem is how to reconcile\ndownward causation with the much-debated causal exclusion\nargument (e.g., Kim 1992; 1999; 2005). To put it very roughly,\nthe core of this argument is that if we accept the plausible\nassumption that all physical occurrences must have sufficient physical\ncauses, it is not clear how there could be room for additional\nhigher-level causes of lower-level physical effects. Some philosophers\nhave argued that this problem arises even for the relatively weak and\nminimalist interventionist theory of causation that is often assumed\nin debates on downward causation (Baumgartner 2013; Gebharter 2017),\nwhereas others have defended the coherence of downward causation\n(Eronen & Brooks 2014; Raatikainen 2010; Woodward 2015; 2021).\n\n",
