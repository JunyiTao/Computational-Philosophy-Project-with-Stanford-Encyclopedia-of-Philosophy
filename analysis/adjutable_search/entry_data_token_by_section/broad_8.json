    "main_text": "Free Will\n4. Free Will\n\nBroad discusses the topic of free will in his inaugural lecture\n\u201cDeterminism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism\u201d (1934).\nIn this rather dense lecture he approaches the issue by associating\nfree will with moral responsibility. More specifically, he frames it\nin terms of the conditions necessary and sufficient for the\napplicability of \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018ought not\u2019 to\nactions. Everyone admits, he says, that there is some sense of\n\u2018could\u2019 in which \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018ought\nnot\u2019 entail \u2018could\u2019. The question revolves around\nthe sense of \u2018could\u2019 involved here: in precisely what\nsense of \u2018could\u2019 is it that if you to ought to perform an\naction you could perform that action?\n\nLet us introduce a couple of Broad\u2019s stipulative definitions. An\naction is obligable if and only if it is an action of which\n\u2018ought to be done\u2019 or \u2018ought not to be done\u2019\ncan be predicated. An action is substitutable if either it\nwas done but could have been left undone, or was left undone but could\nhave been done.\n\nAn action is obligable if and only if it is, in a certain\nsense, substitutable. There are several different senses of\n\u2018could\u2019 and hence of substitutability. Initially Broad\nfocuses on a sense of \u2018could\u2019 which he calls voluntary\nsubstitutability. Consider an action A that was not\nperformed. Suppose that if the agent had willed (chosen,\ndecided) to do A she would have done it. In that case\nA is voluntarily substitutable. Suppose, however, that she\nwould not have done A even if she had willed to do it. If\nthat\u2019s the case, A is not voluntarily substitutable.\nBroad takes it as evident that voluntary substitutability is a\nnecessary condition for obligability. That is, he takes it as evident\nthat,\n\nA is obligable only if A is voluntarily\nsubstitutable.\n\n\nBut is it also a sufficient condition? Is it also true\nthat,\n\nIf A is voluntarily substitutable then A is\nobligable.\n\n\nBroad presents an argument in favour of a negative answer, i.e. in\nfavour of the answer that it could very well be true that someone\nwould have done an action if he had willed to do it, while it is\nnonetheless false that the action is obligable (and hence false that\nit is voluntarily substitutable). We are asked to consider a person\nwho gradually becomes addicted to a drug like morphine. At the earlier\nstages he could have willed with sufficient strength to ensure that\nthe temptation would have been resisted. At the later stages he could\nnot. \u201cNow at every stage, from the earliest to the latest, the\nhypothetical proposition would be true: \u2018If he had willed with a\ncertain degree of force and persistence to avoid taking morphine, he\nwould have avoided taking it\u2019. Yet we would say at the earlier\nstages that he ought to have resisted, whilst at the final stages we\nshould be inclined to say that \u2018ought\u2019 and \u2018ought\nnot\u2019 have ceased to apply\u201d (1934, p. 200). In other words,\nin the later stages we are inclined to hold that the action of\nabstaining from morphine has ceased to be obligable, in spite of the\nfact that it remains true that if he had willed with\nsufficient force and persistence to abstain he would have\nabstained.\n\nThis is Broad\u2019s version of an argument sometimes raised against\nthe classical compatibilist conditional analysis of \u2018S\ncould have done\n otherwise\u2019.[12]\n According to the classical compatibilist analysis this is to be\nunderstood simply as \u2018if S had willed to act\ndifferently S would have acted differently\u2019. The\nargument shows that this will not do: there are situations where an\nagent would have acted otherwise if she had willed\ndifferently but nonetheless could not have acted differently simply\nbecause she could not have willed to act\n differently.[13]\n\nSo voluntary substitutability is not sufficient for obligability: for\nan action to be obligable it is not sufficient that the agent would\nhave acted otherwise if she had willed otherwise. It is also clear\nthat a further condition must be fulfilled, viz. that she could\nhave willed to act otherwise. This leads us to the question as to\nthe correct analysis of \u2018could have willed differently\u2019.\nBroad examines a conditional analysis according to which this\nmeans:\n\nIf S had willed differently in the past S\u2019s\nconative-emotional dispositions and knowledge about S\u2019s\nown nature would have been so constituted that S, at the time\nwhen S acted, would have willed differently.\n\n\nCan we perhaps claim an action to be obligable if (a) it is\nvoluntarily substitutable, and (b) the agent could have willed to do\nit, in the specified conditional sense of \u2018could have\nwilled\u2019? In other words, is the joint condition of (a) and (b)\nsufficient for obligability? Broad rejects this proposal. Suppose the\nagent could not have willed differently in the past (say six\nmonths ago). It is \u201csurely irrelevant to say that, if\nhe had done so his conative dispositions would have been\ndifferent at a later stage from what they in fact were then, and that\nhe would have willed otherwise than he then did\u201d (1934,\np. 204). As he points out, at this juncture it is tempting to refer to\nstill earlier volitions (say twelve months ago). He contends, however,\nthat this is useless since the very same difficulty will reappear.\n\nBroad holds, then, that neither \u2018could have acted\ndifferently\u2019 nor \u2018could have willed\ndifferently\u2019 can be given a conditional analysis. Having\ndiscarded conditional types of substitutability he turns to\ncategorical substitutability. If an action is obligable it\nmust be substitutable in a categorical sense. \u201cWe must be able\nto say of an action, which was done, that it could have been avoided,\nin some sense of \u2018could\u2019 which is not definable in terms\nof \u2018would have, if\u2019\u201d (1934, p. 204). Note that the\nquoted passage merely states that categorical substitutability is a\nnecessary condition of obligability. It is clear, however,\nthat Broad also takes it to be a sufficient condition. Thus, his\nposition is that,\n\nA is obligable if and only if A is categorically\nsubstitutable.\n\n\nNow precisely what is categorical substitutability? As we\nshall presently see, Broad claims that this notion is only partly\nintelligible.\n\nCategorical substitutability involves a negative and a positive\ncondition. These are necessary and jointly sufficient for\nobligability. The negative condition says that the\nagent\u2019s willing of a certain action was not completely\ndetermined by the nomic and singular conditions which existed at the\ntime of willing. Not surprisingly, Broad regards an action that merely\nfulfils this condition as \u201can accident, lucky or\nunlucky as the case may be.\u201d Neither the agent nor\n\u201canything else in the universe can properly be praised or blamed\nfor it\u201d (1934, p. 212; Broad\u2019s italics).\n\nThe positive condition (which must also be fulfilled) says\nthat the willing of the action is \u201cliterally determined by the\nagent or self, considered as a substance or continuant, and not by a\ntotal cause which contains as factors events in and\ndispositions of the agent\u201d (1934, p. 214\u20135;\nBroad\u2019s italics). Thus a free action is an action that is caused\nby the agent.\n\n(Note that the view that there are agent-caused effects is a form of\nindeterminism, since it says that there are certain events\nwhich, although they are indeed caused, are not fixed as a matter of\nnatural law.)\n\nBroad rejects the idea of agent-causation as unintelligible.\n\nNow it is surely quite evident that, if the beginning of a certain\nprocess at a certain time is determined at all, its total cause\nmust contain as an essential factor another event or process\nwhich enters into the moment from which the determined event\nor process issues. I see no prima facie objection to there\nbeing events which are not completely determined. But, in so far as an\nevent is determined, an essential factor in its total cause\nmust be other events. How could an event possibly be\ndetermined to happen at a certain date if its total cause contained no\nfactor to which the notion of date has any application? And how can\nthe notion of date have any application to anything that is not an\nevent? (1934, p. 215; Broad\u2019s emphasis.)\n\n\nIf an agent wills to perform an action at a certain time there must be\na process or event that occurs at that time (or the moment before).\nThus there must be something about the agent that explains why the\nwilling of the action started precisely at that time rather than at a\nslightly earlier or later time. The agent per se will not\ndo.\n\nThe position Broad reaches is a version of what is sometimes called\nfree will pessimism: free will is incompatible with\ndeterminism, but there is no viable form of indeterminism\nwhich leaves room for free will, either; therefore, free will does not\nexist\u2014indeed could not exist.\n",
