    "main_text": "Kaplan\u2019s Theory of Indexicals || Character\n3.4 Character\n\n\nKaplan (1989a, p. 505) says that he represents the character of an\nexpression with a function on contexts whose value at any context is\nthe expression\u2019s content at that context. For example, the\ncontent of \u2018I\u2019 at any context \\(c\\) is the agent\ncharacter of \\(c\\). So the character of \u2018I\u2019 is a\nfunction on contexts whose value at any context \\(c\\) is the agent\nof \\(c\\). The value of the character of \u2018I\u2019 at a\ncontext in which Mary is the agent is just Mary herself, and its value\nat a context in which John is the agent is just John himself. The\ncharacter of a sentence is a function whose value at any context is the\nstructured propositional content of that sentence at that context. For\ninstance, the character of \u2018I am a philosopher\u2019 is a\nfunction whose value at any context \\(c\\) in which \\(A\\) is\nthe agent of \\(c\\) is the proposition \n\\(\\langle A, \\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\). \nIf Mary is the agent of \\(c\\), then the value of this function\nat \\(c\\) is \n\\(\\langle \\text{Mary}, \\text{being a philosopher} \\rangle\\).\n",
