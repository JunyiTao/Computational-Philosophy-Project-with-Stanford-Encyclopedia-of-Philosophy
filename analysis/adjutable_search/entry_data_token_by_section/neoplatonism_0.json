    "main_text": "Historical Orientation: Antiquity\n1. Historical Orientation: Antiquity\nRightly or wrongly, the Egyptian-born Plotinus (204/5\u2013270) is\ncommonly regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism. He was a pupil of\nthe Alexandrian philosopher Ammonius Saccas (3nd century), who reportedly did not\npublish anything and remains one of the most enigmatic philosophers of\nall antiquity. Around 245, at the age of 40, Plotinus moved from\nAlexandria to Rome and founded a school of philosophy there. At first,\nhis instruction too was entirely oral, until his most talented pupil,\nPorphyry, persuaded him to commit his seminars to the page. After\nPlotinus\u2019 death, Porphyry edited and published these writings,\nhaving arranged them in a collection of six books consisting of nine\nessays each (the so-called \u201cEnneads\u201d or\n\u201cnines\u201d).\nBy any standard of intellectual prowess, Plotinus is one of the\nintellectual giants of antiquity, on a par with the likes of Plato,\nAristotle, and Chrysippus, even if modernity is still hesitant to\naccord him such an exalted status. As in the case of his preeminent\nprecursors, Plotinus\u2019 philosophical system combines innovation\nwith tradition. The question of precisely which predecessors inspired\nhim is still unclear and in need of further investigation. Carefully\nselected passages from Plato\u2019s dialogues and Aristotle\u2019s\nMetaphysics often serve him as starting points for his own\nspeculations; Stoic ethics is very much in evidence, as are the views\nof the Peripatetic philosopher Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd-3rd centuries). A general\nintellectual background is provided by the so-called Middle\nPlatonists, above all Numenius of Apamea (2nd\ncentury). Moreover, it is not impossible that Gnosticism (which\nPlotinus vehemently opposed) as well as the writings circulating under\nthe name of Hermes Trismegistus confirmed or even informed his\nmetaphysical monism. Lastly, Plotinus may have been well aware of the\nrise of Christianity, but if so, he was not as alarmed by it as his\npupil Porphyry.\nIn the course of its history in late antiquity, Neoplatonism proved\nto be adaptable, fluid and dynamic, much more so than the system of\nthe Stoics, the dominant philosophy during Hellenistic times. It\nappealed to the mundane literati as much as to the religious\nzealot, to the die-hard pagan as much as to the up-start Christian who\nneeded a philosophical background to parse the theological fine points\nwhich would eventually distinguish the orthodox from the\nheretic. Important figures of late antique Neoplatonism were the\nalready mentioned pupil of Plotinus, Porphyry, his pupil Iamblichus,\nPlutarch of Athens, Syrianus, Proclus, Simplicius, Damascius, Ammonius\nHermeiou, John Philoponus, Olympiodorus, and Stephanus of Alexandria,\nto name but the most important. All of them, in different and fascinating ways,\ncontributed to the development and internal diversification of the\nschool\u2019s doctrines. (Some of these philosophers have their own\nentries in this encyclopedia; see the Related Entries section\nbelow.) \nImportantly, the new direction Plotinus, and presumably Ammonius\nSaccas before him, had given to Greek philosophy gradually acquired\ntraction among the Greco-Roman elites. Ironically, it may have\ncontributed to the acceptance of Christianity among the educated,\nthereby elevating the religious sentiments of the empire\u2019s\nmisfits and downtrodden to the ideology of a political system\nsanctified by the will of god. Evidence for the increasing\nNeoplatonization of Christianity is abundant: The brilliant Christian\ntheologian Origen, some twenty years older than Plotinus, may also\nhave been a pupil of Ammonius Saccas; the Cappadocian Fathers Basil\nand Gregory of Nazianzus spent their youth in philosophical study in\nAthens in the 4th century, where they most certainly were\nexposed to Neoplatonism, while Augustine of Hippo (354\u2013430) was\nintimately familiar with the writings of Plotinus and Porphyry. The\ncut-throat debates about transubstantiation (in the Eucharist), the\nhypostases of the Trinity, or the divine/human nature of Christ, could\nnot even be followed without a thorough training in current Greek\nphilosophical discourse. By the end of the 5th century, the\naudience in the philosophical classrooms in Alexandria was\npredominantly Christian, and Neoplatonism continued to be taught in\nsome form or other in Athens, Alexandria, Constantinople, Baghdad,\nMistra, and other pockets of learning until its triumphant revival in\nRenaissance Italy.\n",
