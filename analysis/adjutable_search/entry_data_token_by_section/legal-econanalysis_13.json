    "main_text": "The Normativity of Law || Strategies of Accommodation\n4.3 Strategies of Accommodation\n\nAs the last subsection noted, prudence can explain differences in\nbehavior that result from the different legal forms. Each form creates\na different expected sanction and an economically rational actor will\nrespond differently to these different expected sanctions. Moreover,\nany differences in expected behavior might be attributable to\ndifferences in the policymaker\u2019s objective function. Different\nburdens of proof generate different distributions of error types. A\npolicymaker might tolerate more deviant behavior to ensure that\ninnocent people do not suffer\n penalties.[18]\n\nNevertheless, one might intuitively expect greater compliance to\nemissions standards regulated through a criminal penalty than to\nemissions standards regulated by a tax, even if the expected payment\nfor each available action were identical under the two regimes. This\nintuition runs counter to the rational choice explanation. Only if\nthis intuition is correct could we say that the law provides\nnon-prudential reasons for action. \n\nThe economic model of behavior, however, is extremely flexible. It\nrequires careful consideration to conclude that the model cannot\naccommodate \u201cnormativity.\u201d This section assesses the\ntechniques available to the economic model of behavior to determine\nthe extent to which ideas of normativity may be accommodated.\n\nFrom the philosophical literature on obligation and the very limited\neconomic literature on obligatory behavior, one may extract four\npossible mechanisms through which obligation influences individual\naction. The first mechanism simply reduces obligations to the standard\nmodel of (narrowly) self-interested rationality. The discussion of\nlegal form above suggested how this reduction might proceed. Further\nmethods of reduction are discussed below. \n\nSecond, one might weaken the assumption of full rationality. Boundedly\nrational agents may have reason to follow rules and these rules,\nthough perhaps best treated as rules of thumb, might cause the agent\nto mimic normative behavior. \n\nThe third mechanism identifies preference as the pathway through which\nobligation operates; obligations motivate when they are\n\u201cinternalized.\u201d Internalization may take at least two\ndifferent forms. One form dissolves the normativity of law while the\nother has an ad hoc quality. \n\nFinally, obligation may influence the agent\u2019s deliberative or\ndecision process. One might understand this mechanism as treating the\nagent\u2019s preferences as context-dependent; how she ranks\nalternatives depends on whether (and which) obligations apply. I\nconsider each of these mechanisms in turn.\n4.3.1 Reduction\n\nEconomic analysis of law easily accommodates sanction theories of\nduty. The analyst here simply reduces the sanction theory to\nself-interested preference maximization. This approach, as noted\nabove, adheres to the assumption that agents are (narrowly)\nself-interested. It recognizes, however, that a legal rule may either\nprovide the agent with relevant information (and hence change her\nbeliefs) or place a price on certain actions. The price a legal rule\nplaces on conduct will depend on the legal form as the legal form\ndetermines the monitoring mechanism and the burdens of proof, both of\nwhich determine the probability that the legal sanction will be\nimposed. \n\nIt is also straightforward to see how a legal rule might provide\ninformation that alters the agent\u2019s beliefs about the likely\noutcome of various courses of action. Consider, for example, a driver\non a mountain road who encounters a sign that indicates an impending\ncurve on which the speed limit has been lowered to 15 miles per hour.\nIn light of this sign, the agent should adjust her beliefs about the\nhighest safe speed at which she can negotiate the road. Regulations of\nhealth and safety may operate in a similar way. \n\nA third way that obligation might be reduced to self-interest relies\non repeated interaction. Agents with foresight understand that\nbehavior that deviates from the legal norm today may have consequences\nfor their subsequent dealings in the future. This harm arises even\nwhen the legal sanction is not imposed. The threat of future harm thus\nmay induce compliance with a legal norm even in the absence of\nsanction. \n\nFinally, in many instances, rational agents need to coordinate their\nactions. In coordination games, for example, each agent ranks the\ndifferent possible outcomes identically; but, when multiple equilibria\nexist, the agents may fail to coordinate on a desirable equilibrium. A\nlegal rule may publicly announce an equilibrium to play and that\nannouncement may coordinate the agents\u2019 actions. \n\nAnnouncement of a legal rule in this context can coordinate the\nplayers\u2019 actions. It gives each agent a reason to choose as the\nrule dictates if it affects the individual\u2019s beliefs concerning\nwhich strategy the other agents will adopt. On this account, the\nsocial fact that individuals accept the law provides each individual\nwith a reason to act. This reason is independent of any sanction that\nthe law might impose for non-compliance. Moreover this reason is\nprudential in that it best promotes the agent\u2019s own welfare. Of\ncourse, one might say that the reason is also moral as it best\npromotes the well-being of all. This coincidence between the moral and\nprudential results from the coincidence of interests of all agents.\n\n4.3.2 Bounded Rationality\n\nA second route to the accommodation of normativity within the economic\nmodel acknowledges that individuals are boundedly rational. The\nassumption of bounded rationality admits the possibility that agents\nshould follow rules. A legal rule would then be justified, in a manner\nconsistent with Raz\u2019s [1979, 1986] account of authority, when\nadherence to the rule improved the decision making of the agent.\n\nIn the simplest model in which such an account exists, agents face a\ncost of deliberation. The more complex the deliberative calculation,\nthe higher the costs the agent incurs. When the marginal cost of\ndeliberation is sufficiently high, the agent might do better to follow\na rule that quickly, and therefore cheaply, identifies a good but not\noptimal\n action.[19]\n If the expected benefit from choosing the optimal action (relative to\nthe good action) is less than the cost, it is prudent for the agent to\nadopt the rule of thumb. More sophisticated accounts of an economic\nrationale for rule-following rely on more complex models of bounded\nrationality. \n\nTo complete an economic account of the authority of law requires that\none explain why the agent should consider legal rules as the relevant\nrules to which she should defer. One might argue that those who\npromulgate legal rules have special expertise that makes it likely\nthat they will enact rules that are better than the rules that the\nagent herself would formulate. For some legal rules\u2014technical\nrules concerning health and safety promulgated by administrative\nagencies\u2014the argument may have merit. After all the decision at\nissue depends on a mass of technical data that is not easily\nassimilable or manipulable. For many other legal rules promulgated by\nlegislatures and courts, however, the argument may not apply.\n\nSeveral other features of this argument merit attention. First, it\nparallels the argument for authority offered by Joseph\n Raz.[20]\n As in Raz\u2019s argument, authority is specific to legal rules\nrather than to law in general. An agent might believe the law more\nexpert than she with respect to some decisions but not with respect to\nother decisions. In fact, agents with different expertise themselves\nwould find different legal rules authoritative.\n\nSecond, on this account of authority, the legal rule affects the\nagent\u2019s deliberation not because of the sanction for\nnon-compliance but because compliance with the legal rule, even in the\nabsence of a sanction, is in the agent\u2019s best interest. This\nfeature of the account of authority conforms to notions, developed\nfurther below, of the way in which rules enter the deliberative\nprocess. But this feature also limits the applicability of the account\nto those legal rules that bear on the agent\u2019s immediate\ninterest. Many legal rules direct the agent to adopt actions that\nraise her own costs; in the absence of a sanction for non-compliance,\nher own interest would dictate non-compliance. For example, a rule\nrequiring that an agent adopt due care in certain activities may raise\nthe agent\u2019s\n costs.[21]\n\nThe prudential account of authority outlined above primarily addresses\nprivate individuals. One might ask the parallel question concerning\nthe obligation to obey the law of public officials. In some respects,\nthis question has greater significance than the question concerning\nprivate individuals because many acknowledge that the motivation of\nprivate individuals to obey the law is usually prudential, the desire\nto avoid sanctions. Moreover, on some jurisprudential accounts, most\nnotably the legal positivism of H. L. A. Hart, the attitudes and\nbehavior of public officials determine the existence and nature of\nlaw.\n\nThe economic account of authority, however, does not provide a\ncompelling explanation of official behavior. Consider how the economic\naccount applies to public officials. The relevant obligations here are\nthe official obligations of the individual: the judicial obligation to\ndecide cases according to the dictates of stare decisis and\nother obligatory practices; or the executive official\u2019s\nobligation to apply the law. Two difficulties arise immediately. How\nis compliance with these official obligations in the\nindividual\u2019s interest? Why must the agent follow a rule rather\nthan optimize in each instance? This second difficulty is less\ntroublesome than the first; Ronald Heiner [1986], for example, has\noffered a prudential account, grounded in bounded rationality, of the\njudicial obligation to adhere to stare\n decisis.[22]\n\n\nOne might attempt to resolve the first difficulty concerning the\nagent\u2019s interest by arguing that compliance with official\nobligation is in the individual\u2019s interest because she desires\nto maintain her employment. But this explanation rests on an incentive\nargument. The sanction of dismissal induces the compliance rather than\nnormative motivation to comply with one\u2019s obligation; it is\nanother prudential account. The prudential account of authority thus\nfails to overcome this first difficulty. It is not clear then that the\nprudential account of authority can ground the normativity of law.\n4.3.3 Obligation within Preference\n\nEconomic theorists offer a highly abstract account of individual\ndecision-making. Its abstract nature renders the theory remarkably\nflexible. As it is an account of instrumental rationality, it can\naccommodate many different substantive accounts that differ in their\nspecification of what ends are rational or, more simply, whatever ends\nthe agent happens to have. \n\nBriefly, the economic explanation of decisions states simply that the\nagent chooses the feasible option that she ranks most highly according\nto her \u201cpreferences.\u201d \u201cPreference\u201d is a\ntechnical term, not a psychological concept. By definition, a\npreference is a linear order over some domain of objects. A linear\norder is complete, asymmetric, and transitive. Less formally, we may\nunderstand preference as a relation \u201cat least as preferred\nas\u201d over the relevant domain. Completeness requires that, for\nany two objects a, b, either a is at least as\npreferred as b or b is at least as preferred as\na. Asymmetry states that if a is at least as preferred\nas b and b is at least as preferred as a then\na is indifferent to b. Finally transitivity requires\nthat if a is at least as preferred as b and b is\nat least as preferred as c then a is at least as\npreferred as c. \n\nAn agent typically has a number of competing ends. One can interpret\nthe agent\u2019s preferences as her all-things-considered ranking of\nall possible outcomes. One might then consider the obligations under\nwhich the agent finds herself as among the agent\u2019s competing\n\u201cends\u201d. The question of compatibility between economic\nrationality as preference and obligation then reduces to the question\nof whether obligations may be integrated with the other concerns of\nthe agent into an all-things-considered ranking that satisfies the\npreference axioms.\n\nIntegrability presents a serious challenge to the economic account of\nrationality. Nevertheless, the theory has substantial resources to\nmeet this challenge. To illustrate, consider Neumann\u2019s [2007]\nanalysis of the famous example used by Anand [1993] and Sen [1993]. In\nthis example, they consider an agent whom we shall call Freddie.\nFreddie is Liza\u2019s guest for dinner and he has been offered a\nplate with three slices of cake on it. One slice is small, one medium,\nand one large. Freddie has two concerns: he wants the largest piece of\ncake available and he wants to conform to the social norm \u201cnever\ntake the largest piece\u201d. In Sen\u2019s and Anand\u2019s\naccount, Freddie cannot integrate these two concerns into a preference\nbecause his choices violate a condition of contraction consistency\nwhich is necessary for transitivity. That is, from the pair (small\nslice, medium slice), Freddie chooses the small slice but from the\ntriple (small slice, medium slice, large slice), Freddie chooses the\nmedium slice. These choices, however, are inconsistent only under the\ndescription given. \n\nSen and Anand use the absolute size of the pieces of cake to describe\nFreddie\u2019s options. As Neumann points out, this description\nignores a decision relevant aspect of Freddie\u2019s choice\nsituation; Freddie cares about the relative size of the pieces\nof cake. Freddie\u2019s choices under a description using relative\nsizes conform to the axioms defining a preference.\n\nWill appropriate redescription resolve all conflicts between\n\u201cpreference\u201d and \u201cobligation\u201d? A related\napproach to this problem suggests that the answer to this question\ndepends on the structure of the norm. Baigent [2007] and Xu [2007]\nconsider the rationalizability of choice when the agent faces\nnormative constraints. In these situations, the agent, facing a set of\nfeasible options, first eliminates those acts that are normatively\nprohibited. He then chooses the best available option from this\nrestricted set of feasible options. Whether we can attribute an\nall-things-considered preference to the agent depends on the structure\nof the obligation and the detail of the agent\u2019s preferences.\n\n4.3.4 Deliberation.\n\nRationality in economics is instrumental; the agent\u2019s ranking is\ntaken as given and as fundamental. The agent does not deliberate about\nher\n ends.[23]\n Accounts of practical reason, however, often involve deliberation\nover ends. The economic account of rationality may have less success\nin accommodating these accounts of obligation.\n\nRaz [1975] provides an account of practical reasoning in which\nobligation plays a central role. On this account, obligations are\nexclusionary reasons that provide the agent with both a first-order\nreason to take the obligatory act and a second-order reason not to\nconsider some set of first-order reasons actions. This structure\ndifferentiates obligations (or prohibitions) from taxes (or\npermissions).\n\nA simple example illustrates this logic. Consider a prohibition on\nemitting more than 75 parts per billion of sulfur dioxide per hour\ninto the air. This prohibition gives a power-generating plant reason\nnot to emit more than that amount of sulfur dioxide per hour. But it\nalso excludes a variety of other first-order reasons for action from\nthe plant\u2019s consideration. On Raz\u2019s account, the firm\nshould not act on, for instance, the fact that emitting more than 75\nparts per billion of sulfur dioxide per hour would increase its\nprofits (or lower its costs). The obligation would not, presumably,\nexclude reasons that arose from a situation in which a temporary\nfailure to exceed the emissions standard posed a substantial threat to\nthe health and safety of employees. \n\nA tax on sulfur dioxide emissions above 75 parts per billion per hour,\nby contrast, provides the firm with only a first-order reason for\naction. The firm regards the rate of taxation as a price on such\nemissions and can weigh that price against its other costs and\nbenefits. On this account, then, a tax and a fine that create\nidentical expected sanctions and the same distribution of type 1 and\ntype 2 errors should induce different behaviors. The fine will never\nlead to higher emission rates and, under some circumstances, should\ninduce lower emission rates. \n\nCan the economic theory of rationality accommodate this understanding\nof normativity? Arguably, the ad hoc assumption that the\nagent incurs a cost when she fails to comply with a legal duty\ncaptures this idea. This ad hoc cost implies that ordinary\ncosts and benefits must be sufficiently large to outweigh the cost\nimposed by the prohibition. But this approach fails to capture some of\nthe potential subtleties of an exclusionary reason as the obligation\nmay not depend on the size of the costs (or force of the reason) but\non the nature of it. An obligation may exclude some types of costs, no\nmatter how large, but not exclude other types of costs, no matter how\nsmall. \n\nAlternatively, one might understand the agent\u2019s preferences as\ncontext-dependent. The agent\u2019s ranking of alternatives depends\non which set of obligations apply to her. In each situation, she faces\na different set of reasons for action and she must adjust her ranking\nof her options to reflect these different reasons.\n",
