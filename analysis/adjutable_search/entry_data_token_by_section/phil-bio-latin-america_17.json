    "main_text": "Philosophy and History of Biology || Conceptual Historical Analyses\n6. Concluding Remarks\n\nPhilosophy of biology in Latin America has come a long way from its\nearly history. It has been developed through changing and challenging\ncircumstances involving social, political, economic, academic, and\ncultural shifts. However, in recent decades the community of\nphilosophers of biology in the region has experienced exponential\ngrowth, a trend that is repeated with regards to the amount and\ndiversification of its production. The originality and depth of work\nhas increased significantly through dialogue both within Latin America\nand with other regions. This production deserves and is beginning to\nattain international visibility.\n\nThe work of Latin American philosophers of biology of the first and\neven second generation presented here are now studied by new\ngenerations, and many more scholars are trained in this approach to\nthe philosophy of science, laying the foundations for an emerging\ntradition. Philosophy of biology at present plays an important role in\nLatin American developments in philosophy of science. In addition, the\nwork done in this area may contribute to teaching, education, and\ncommunication of science, and to science policy and management. It may\neven contribute to the development of a socially sensitive and\nethically responsible scientific community and society. Although the\nfuture of philosophy of biology in Latin America is difficult to\npredict, we can state that, given appropriate political and economic\nconditions, it will further develop and continue to flourish.\n",
