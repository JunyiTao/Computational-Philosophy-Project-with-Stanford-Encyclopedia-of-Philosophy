    "main_text": "Properties in the Metaphysics of Science || Miscellaneous Topics\n5.1 Miscellaneous Topics\n\nMany predicates in scientific theories (e.g., \u201cbeing a\ngene\u201d and \u201cbeing a belief\u201d) are functionally\ndefined. Namely, their meaning is fixed by appealing to some function\nor set of functions (e.g., encoding and transmitting genetic\ninformation). To make sense of functions, properties are needed.\nFirst, functions can be thought of as webs of causal relationships\nbetween properties or property-instances. Secondly, predicates such as\n\u201cbeing a gene\u201d may be taken to refer to\nhigher-level properties, or at least to something that has\nsuch properties. In this case, the property of being a gene\nwould be the higher-level property of possessing some further\nproperties (e.g., biochemical ones) that play the relevant\nfunctions (i.e., encoding and transmitting genetic information).\nAlternatively, being a gene would be a property that\nsatisfies the former higher-level property. Thirdly, the ensuing\nrealization relationships between higher-level and function-playing\nproperties can only be defined by appealing to properties (see entry\non\n functionalism).\n\nMore generally, many ontological\ndependence  and reduction\nrelationships primarily concern properties: type-identity (Place 1956;\nSmart 1959; Lewis 1966) and token-identity (Davidson 1980) (see entry\non\n the mind/brain identity theory),\n supervenience (Horgan 1982; Kim 1993; entry on\n supervenience);\n realization (Putnam 1975; Wilson 1999; Shoemaker 2007), \nscientific reduction\n(Nagel 1961). Moreover,\na non-reductive relation such as ontological emergence (Bedau 1997;\nPaolini Paoletti 2017b) is typically characterized as a relation\nbetween emergent properties\nand more fundamental\nproperties. Even mechanistic explanations often appeal to properties\nand relations in characterizing the organization, the components, the\npowers and the phenomena displayed by mechanisms (Glennan & Illari\n2018; entry on\n mechanisms in science).\n\nEntities in nature are typified by\n natural kinds.\n These are mostly thought of as properties or property-like entities\nthat carve nature at its joints (Campbell, O'Rourke, & Slater\n2011) at distinct layers of the universe: microphysical (e.g.,\nbeing a neutron), chemical (e.g., being gold),\nbiological (e.g., being a horse).\n\nPhysical quantities such as mass or length are typically treated as\nproperties, specifiable in terms of a magnitude, a certain number, and\na unit measure, e.g., kg or meter, which can itself be specified in\nterms of properties (Mundy 1987; Swoyer 1987). Following Eddon\u2019s\n(2013) overview, it is possible to distinguish two main strands here:\nrelational and monadic properties theories (see also\nDasgupta 2013). In relational theories (Bigelow & Pargetter 1988;\n1991), quantities arise from proportion relations, which may in turn\nbe related by higher-order proportion relations. Consider a certain\nquantity, e.g., mass 3 kg. Here the thrice as massive\nas proportion relation is relevant, which holds of certain pairs\nof objects \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that \\(a\\) is thrice as massive as\n\\(b\\). By virtue of such relational facts, the first members of such\npairs have a mass of 3 kg. Another relational approach is by Mundy\n(1988), who claims that mass 3 kg is a relation between\n(ordered pairs of) objects and numbers. For example, mass 3\nkg is a relation holding between the ordered pair \\(\\langle a,\nb\\rangle\\) (assuming that \\(a\\) is thrice as massive as \\(b\\), and not\nthe other way round) and the number 3; or\u2014if relations have\nbuilt-in relational order\u2014between \\(a, b\\) and 3. Knowles (2015)\nholds a similar view, wherein physical quantities are relations that\nobjects bear to numbers. According to the monadic properties approach,\nquantities are intrinsic properties of objects (Swoyer 1987; Armstrong\n1988; 1989). As we saw, Armstrong develops such a view by taking\nquantities to be structural properties. Related metaphysical inquiries\nconcern the dimensions of quantities (Skow 2017) and the status of\nforces (Massin 2009).\n\nLastly, properties play a prominent role in two well-known accounts of\nthe\n laws of nature:\n the nomological necessitation account and law\ndispositionalism. The former has been expounded by Tooley (1977;\n1987), Dretske (1977) and Armstrong (1983). Roughly, following\nArmstrong, a law of nature consists in a second-order and external\nnomological necessitation relation \\(\\rN\\), contingently holding\nbetween first-order universals \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\): \\(\\rN(P, Q)\\). Such a\nhigher-order fact necessitates certain lower-order regularities, i.e.,\nall the objects that have \\(P\\) also have \\(Q\\) (by nomological\nnecessity, in virtue of \\(\\rN(P, Q))\\). Law dispositionalism\ninterprets laws of nature by appealing to dispositional properties.\nAccording to it, laws of nature \u201cflow\u201d from the essence of\nsuch properties. This implies that laws of nature hold with\nmetaphysical necessity: whenever the dispositions are in place, the\nrelevant laws must be in place too (Cartwright 1983; Ellis 2001; Bird\n2007; Chakravartty 2007; Fischer 2018; see also Schrenk 2017 and\nDumsday 2019). (For criticisms, see, e.g., van Fraassen 1989 as\nregards the former approach, and McKitrick 2018 and Paolini Paoletti\n2020b, as regards the latter).\n5.2. Essentially Categorical vs. Essentially Dispositional Properties\n\nThere is a domestic dispute among supporters of properties in the\nmetaphysics of science, regarding the very nature of such properties\n(or at least the fundamental ones). We may distinguish two extreme\nviews, pure dispositionalism and pure\ncategoricalism. According to the former, all properties are\nessentially dispositional (\u201cdispositional\u201d, for\nbrevity\u2019s sake, from now on), since they are nothing more than\ncausal powers; their causative roles, i.e., which effects\ntheir instantiations can cause, exhaust their essences. According to\npure categoricalism, all properties are essentially categorical (in\nbrief, \u201ccategorical\u201d, in the following), because their\ncausative roles are not essential to them. If anything is essential to\na property, it is rather a non-dispositional and intrinsic aspect\ncalled \u201cquiddity\u201d (after Armstrong 1989), which need not\nbe seen as an additional entity over and above the property itself\n(Locke 2012, in response to Hawthorne 2001). Between such views there\nlie a number of intermediate positions.\n\nPure dispositionalism has been widely supported in the last few\ndecades (Mellor 1974; 2000; Shoemaker 1984: ch. 10 and 11 [in terms of\ncausal roles]; Mumford 1998; 2004; Bird 2005; 2007; Chakravartty 2007;\nWhittle 2008; see Tugby 2013 for an attempt to argue from this sort of\nview to a Platonist conception of properties). There are three main\narguments in favor of it. First, pure dispositionalism easily accounts\nfor the natural necessity of the laws of nature, insofar as such a\nnecessity just \u201cflows\u201d from the essence of the\ndispositional properties involved. Secondly, dispositional properties\ncan be easily known as they really are, because it is part of their\nessence that they affect us in certain ways. Thirdly, at the\n(presumably fundamental) micro-physical level, properties are only\ndescribed dispositionally, which is best explained by their being\ndispositional (Ellis & Lierse 1994; N. Williams 2011).\n\nNevertheless, pure dispositionalism is affected by several problems.\nFirst, some authors believe that it is not easy to provide a clear-cut\ndistinction between dispositional and would-be non-dispositional\nproperties (Cross 2005). Secondly, it seems that the essence of\ncertain properties does not include, or is not exhausted by, their\ncausative roles: qualia, inert and epiphenomenal\n properties,[14]\n structural and geometrical properties, spatio-temporal properties\n(Prior 1982; Armstrong 1999; for some responses, see Mellor 1974 and\nBird 2007; 2009). Thirdly, there can be symmetrical causative\nroles. Consider three distinct properties \\(A\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) such\nthat \\(A\\) can cause \\(B\\), \\(B\\) can cause \\(A\\), \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) can\ntogether cause \\(C\\) and nothing else characterizes \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\\(A\\) and \\(B\\) have the same causative role. Therefore, in pure\ndispositionalism, they turn out to be identical, against the\nhypothesis (Hawthorne 2001; see also Contessa 2019). Fourthly,\naccording to some, pure dispositionalism falls prey to (at least)\nthree distinct regresses (for a fourth regress, see Psillos 2006).\nSuch regresses arise from the fact that the essential causative role\nof a dispositional property \\(P\\) \u201cpoints towards\u201d further\nproperties \\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc. qua possible effects. The\nessential causative roles of the latter \u201cpoint towards\u201d\nstill other properties, and so on. The first regress concerns the\nidentity of \\(P\\), which is never fixed, as it depends on the identity\nof further properties, which depend for their identity on still other\nproperties, and so on (Lowe 2006; Barker 2009; 2013). The second\nregress concerns the knowability of \\(P\\) (Swinburne 1980). \\(P\\) is\nonly knowable through its possible effects (i.e., the instantiation of\n\\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc.), included in its causative role. Yet, such\npossible effects are only knowable through their possible effects, and\nso on. The third regress concerns the actuality of \\(P\\) (Armstrong\n1997). \\(P\\)\u2019s actuality is never reached, since \\(P\\) is\nnothing but the power to give rise to \\(S\\), \\(T\\), etc., which are\nnothing but the powers to give rise to further properties, and so on.\nFor responses to these regresses, see Molnar 2003; Marmodoro 2009;\nBauer 2012; McKitrick 2013; see also Ingthorsson 2013.\n\nPure categoricalism seems to imply that causative roles are only\ncontingently associated to a property. Therefore, on pure\ncategoricalism, a property can possibly have distinct causative roles,\nwhich allows it to explain\u2014among other things\u2014the apparent\ncontingency of causative roles and the possibility of recombining a\nproperty with distinct causative roles. Its supporters include Lewis\n(1986b, 2009), Armstrong (1999), Schaffer (2005), and more recently\nLivanios (2017), who provides further arguments based on the\nmetaphysics of science. Kelly (2009) and Smith (2016) may be added to\nthe list, although they take roles to be non-essential and necessary\n(for further options, see also Kimpton-Nye 2018, Yates 2018a, Coates\nforthcoming and Tugby forthcoming).\n\nHowever, pure categoricalism falls prey to two sorts of difficulties.\nFirst, the contingency of causative roles has some unpalatable\nconsequences: unbeknownst to us, two distinct properties can swap\ntheir roles; they can play the same role at the same time; the same\nrole can be played by one property at one time and by another property\nat a later time; an \u201calien\u201d property can replace a\nfamiliar one by playing its role (Black 2000). Secondly, and more\ngenerally, we are never able to know which properties play which\nroles, nor are we able to know the intrinsic nature of such\nproperties. This consequence should be accepted with \u201cRamseyan\nhumility\u201d (Lewis 2009; see also Langton 1998 for a related,\nKantian, sort of humility) or it should be countered in the same way\nas we decide to counter any broader version of skepticism (Schaffer\n2005). On this issue, see also Whittle (2006); Locke (2009); Kelly\n(2013); Yates (2018b).\n\nLet us now turn to some intermediate positions.\n\nAccording to dualism (Ellis 2001; Molnar 2003), there are\nboth dispositional and categorical properties. Dualism is meant to\ncombine the virtues of pure dispositionalism and pure categoricalism.\nIt then faces the charge of adopting a less parsimonious ontology,\nsince it accepts two classes of properties rather than one, i.e.,\ndispositional and categorical ones.\n\nAccording to the identity theory (Heil 2003; 2012; Jaworski\n2016; Martin 2008; G. Strawson 2008; see also N. Williams 2019), every\nproperty is both dispositional and categorical (or qualitative). The\nmain problem here is how to characterize the distinction and relation\nof these two \u201csides\u201d. Martin and Heil suggest that they\nare two distinct ways of partially considering one and the same\nproperty, whereas Mumford (1998) explores the possibility of seeing\nthem as two distinct ways of conceptualizing the property in question.\nHeil claims that the qualitative and the dispositional sides need to\nbe identified with one another and with the whole property. Jacobs\n(2011) holds that the qualitative side consists in the possession of\nsome qualitative nature by the property, whereas the dispositional\nside consists in that property being (part of) a sufficient truthmaker\nfor certain counterfactuals. Dispositional and qualitative sides may\nalso be seen as essential, higher-order properties of properties, as\nsupervenient and ontologically innocent aspects of properties\n(Giannotti 2019), or as constituents of the essence of properties\n(Taylor 2018). In general, the identity theory is between Scylla and\nCharybdis. If it reifies the dispositional and qualitative sides, it\nruns the risk of implying some sort of dualism. If it insists on the\nidentity between them, it runs the opposite risk of turning into a\npure dispositionalist theory (Taylor 2018).\n6. Formal Property Theories and their applications\n\nFormal property theories are logical systems that aim at formulating\n\u201cgeneral noncontingent laws that deal with properties\u201d\n(Bealer & M\u00f6nnich 1989: 133). In the next subsection we shall\noutline how they work. In the two subsequent subsections we shall\nbriefly consider their deployment in natural language semantics and\nthe foundations of mathematics, which can be taken to provide further\nreasons for the acknowledgment of properties in one\u2019s ontology,\nor at least of certain kinds of properties.\n6.1 Logical Systems for Properties\n\nThese systems allow for terms corresponding to properties, in\nparticular variables that are meant to range over properties and that\ncan be quantified over. This can be achieved in two ways. Either\n(option 1; Cocchiarella 1986a) the terms standing for properties are\npredicates or (option 2; Bealer 1982) such terms are subject terms\nthat can be linked to other subject terms by a special predicate that\nis meant to express a predication relation (let us use\n\u201cpred\u201d) pretty much as in standard set theory a special\npredicate, \u201c\\(\\in\\)\u201d, is used to express the membership\nrelation. To illustrate, given the former option, an assertion such as\n\u201cthere is a property that both John and Mary have\u201d can be\nrendered as\n\\[\\notag \\exists P(P(j) \\amp P(m)).\\]\n\nGiven the second option, it can be rendered as\n\\[\\notag \\exists x(\\textrm{pred}(x, j) \\amp \\textrm{pred}(x, m)).\\]\n\n(The two options can be combined as in Menzel 1986; see Menzel 1993\nfor further discussion).\n\nWhatever option one follows, in spelling out such theories one\ntypically postulates a rich realm of properties. Traditionally, this\nis done by a so-called comprehension principle which, intuitively,\nasserts that, for any well-formed formula (\u201cwff\u201d) \\(A\\),\nwith \\(n\\) free variables, \\(x_1 , \\ldots ,x_n\\), there is a\ncorresponding \\(n\\)-adic property. Following option 1, it goes as\nfollows:\n\\[\\tag{CP} \\exists R^n \\forall x_1 \\ldots \\forall x_n(R^n(x_1 ,\n\\ldots ,x_n) \\leftrightarrow A). \\]\n\nAlternatively, one can use a variable-binding operator, \\(\\lambda\\),\nthat, given an open wff, generates a term (called a \u201clambda\nabstract\u201d) that is meant to stand for a property. This way to\nproceed is more flexible and is followed in the most recent versions\nof property theory. We shall thus stick to it in the following. To\nillustrate, we can apply \u201c\\(\\lambda\\)\u201d to the open\nformula, \u201c\\((R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)\u201d to form the one-place\ncomplex predicate \u201c[\\(\\lambda x (R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)]\u201d; if\n\u201c\\(R\\)\u201d denotes being red and \u201c\\(S\\)\u201d\ndenotes being square, then this complex predicate denotes the\ncompound, conjunctive property being red and square.\nSimilarly, we can apply the operator to the open formula\n\u201c\\(\\exists y(L(x, y))\\)\u201d to form the one-place predicate\n\u201c[\\(\\lambda x \\exists y(L(x, y))\\)]\u201d; if\n\u201c\\(L\\)\u201d stands for loves, this complex predicate\ndenotes the compound property loving someone (whereas\n\u201c[\\(\\lambda y \\exists x(L(x, y))\\)]\u201d would denote\nbeing loved by someone). To ensure that lambda abstracts\ndesignate the intended property, one should assume a \u201cprinciple\nof lambda conversion\u201d. Given option 1, it can be stated\nthus:\n\\[\\tag{\\(\\lambda\\)-conv} [\\lambda x_1\\ldots x_n A](t_1 , \\ldots\n,t_n) \\leftrightarrow A(x_1 /t_1 , \\ldots ,x_n /t_n).\\]\n\n\\(A(x_1 /t_1 , \\ldots ,x_n /t_n)\\) is the wff resulting from\nsimultaneously replacing each \\(x_i\\) in \\(A\\) with \\(t_i\\) (for \\(1\n\\le i \\le n)\\), provided \\(t_i\\) is free for \\(x_i\\) in \\(A\\)). For\nexample, given this principle, [\\(\\lambda x (R(x) \\amp S(x))](j)\\) is\nthe case iff \\((R(j) \\amp S(j))\\) is also the case.\n\nStandard second-order logic allows for predicate variables bound by\nquantifiers. Hence, to the extent that these variables are taken to\nrange over properties, this system could be seen as a formal theory of\nproperties. Its expressive power is however limited, since it does not\nallow for subject terms that stand for properties. Thus, for example,\none cannot even say of a property \\(F\\) that \\(F = F\\). This is a\nserious limitation if one wants a formal tool for a realm of\nproperties whose laws one is trying to explore. Standard higher order\nlogics beyond the second order obviate this limitation by allowing for\npredicates in subject position, provided that the predicates that are\npredicated of them belong to a higher type. This presupposes a grammar\nin which predicates are assigned types of increasing levels, which can\nbe taken to mean that the properties themselves, for which the\npredicates stand for, are arranged into a hierarchy of types. Thus,\nsuch logics appropriate one version or another of the type theory\nconcocted by Russell to tame his own paradox and related conundrums.\nIf a predicate can be predicated of another predicate only if the\nformer is of a type higher than the latter, then self-predication is\nbanished and Russell\u2019s paradox cannot even be formulated.\nFollowing this line, we can construct a type-theoretical formal\nproperty theory. The simple theory of types, as presented, e.g., in\nCopi (1971), can be seen as a prototypical version of such a property\ntheory (if we neglect the principle of extensionality assumed by\nCopi). The type-theoretical approach keeps having supporters. For\nexample, it is followed in the property theories embedded in\nZalta\u2019s (1983) theory of abstract objects and more recently in\nthe metaphysical systems proposed by Williamson (2013) and Hale\n(2013).\n\nHowever, for reasons sketched in\n \u00a72.4,\n type theory is hardly satisfactory. Accordingly, many type-free\nversions of property theory have been developed over the years and no\nconsensus on what the right strategy is appears to be in sight. Of\ncourse, without type-theoretical constraints, given \\((\\lambda\\)-conv)\nand classical logic (CL), paradoxes such as Russell\u2019s\nimmediately follow (to see this, consider this instance of\n\\((\\lambda\\textrm{-conv}): [\\lambda x {\\sim}x(x)]([\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)]) \\leftrightarrow{\\sim}[\\lambda x {\\sim}x(x)]([\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)])\\)). In formal systems where abstract singular terms or\npredicates may (but need not) denote properties (Swoyer 1998), formal\ncounterparts of (complex) predicates like \u201cbeing a property that\ndoes not exemplify itself\u201d (formally, \u201c[\\(\\lambda x\n{\\sim}x(x)\\)]\u201d) could exist in the object language without\ndenoting properties; from this perspective, Russell\u2019s paradox\nmerely shows that such predicates do not stand for properties\n(similarly, according to Schnieder 2017, it shows that it is not\npossible that a certain property exists). But we would like to have\ngeneral criteria to decide when a predicate stands for a property and\nwhen it does not. Moreover, one may wonder what gives these predicates\nany significance at all if they do not stand for properties. There are\nthen motivations for building type-free property theories in which all\npredicates stand for properties. We can distinguish two main strands\nof them: those that weaken CL and those that circumscribe\n\\((\\lambda\\)-conv) (some of the proposals to be mentioned below are\nformulated in relation to set theory, but can be easily translated\ninto proposals for property theory).\n\nAn early example of the former approach was offered in a 1938 paper by\nthe Russian logician D. A. Bochvar (Bochvar 1938 [1981]), where the\nprinciple of excluded middle is sacrificed as a consequence of the\nadoption of what is now known as Kleene\u2019s weak three-valued\nscheme. An interesting recent attempt based on giving up excluded\nmiddle is Field 2004. A rather radical alternative proposal is to\nembrace a paraconsistent logic and give up the principle of\nnon-contradiction (Priest 1987). A different way of giving up CL is by\nquestioning its structural rules and turn to a substructural logic, as\nin Mares and Paoli (2014). The problem with all these approaches is\nwhether their underlying logic is strong enough for all the intended\napplications of property theory, in particular to natural language\nsemantics and the foundations of mathematics.\n\nAs for the second strand (based on circumscribing \\((\\lambda\\)-conv)),\nit has been proposed to read the axioms of a standard set theory such\nas ZFC, minus extensionality, as if they were about properties rather\nthan sets (Schock 1969; Bealer 1982; Jubien 1989). The problem with\nthis is that these axioms, understood as talking about sets, can be\nmotivated by the iterative conception of sets, but they seem rather\nad hoc when understood as talking about properties\n(Cocchiarella 1985). An alternative can be found in Cocchiarella\n1986a, where \\((\\lambda\\)-conv) is circumscribed by adapting to\nproperties the notion of stratification used by Quine for sets. This\napproach is however subject to a version of Russell\u2019s paradox\nderivable from contingent but intuitively possible facts (Orilia 1996)\nand to a paradox of hyperintensionality (Bozon 2004) (see Landini 2009\nand Cocchiarella 2009 for a discussion of both). Orilia (2000; Orilia\n& Landini 2019) has proposed another strategy for circumscribing\n\\((\\lambda\\)-conv), based on applying to exemplification Gupta\u2019s\nand Belnap\u2019s theory of circular definitions.\n\nIndependently of the paradoxes (Bealer & M\u00f6nnich 1989: 198\nff.), there is the issue of providing identity conditions for\nproperties, specifying when it is the case that two properties are\nidentical. If one thinks of properties as meanings of natural language\npredicates and tries to account for intensional contexts, one will be\ninclined to assume rather fine-grained identity conditions, possibly\neven allowing that [\\(\\lambda x(R(x) \\amp S(x))\\)] and [\\(\\lambda\nx(S(x) \\amp R(x))\\)] are distinct (see Fox & Lappin 2015 for an\napproach based on operational distinctions among computable\nfunctions). On the other hand, if one thinks of properties as causally\noperative entities in the physical world, one will want to provide\nrather coarse-grained identity conditions. For instance, one might\nrequire that [\\(\\lambda x A\\)] and [\\(\\lambda x B\\)] are the same\nproperty iff it is physically necessary that \\(\\forall x(A\n\\leftrightarrow B)\\). Bealer (1982) tries to combine the two\napproaches (see also Bealer & M\u00f6nnich\n 1989)[15].\n6.2 Semantics and Logical Form\n\nThe formal study of natural language semantics started with Montague\nand gave rise to a flourishing field of inquiry (see entry on\n Montague semantics).\n The basic idea in this field is to associate to natural language\nsentences wffs of a formal language, in order to represent sentence\nmeanings in a logically perspicuous manner. The association reflects\nthe compositionality of meanings: different syntactic subcomponents of\nsentences correspond systematically to syntactic subcomponents of the\nwffs; subcomponents of wffs thus represent the meanings of the\nsubcomponents of the sentences. The formal language eschews\nambiguities and has its own formal semantics, which grants that\nformulas have logical properties and relations, such as logical truth\nand entailments, so that in particular certain sequences of formulas\ncount as logically valid arguments. The ambiguities we normally find\nin natural language sentences and the entailment relations that link\nthem are captured by associating ambiguous sentences to different\nunambiguous wffs, in such a way that when a natural language argument\nis felt to be valid there is a corresponding sequence of wffs that\ncount as a logically valid argument. In order to achieve all this,\nMontague appealed to a higher-order logic. To see why this was\nnecessary, one may focus on this valid argument:\n\n(1)\nevery Greek is mortal;\n(2)\nthe president of Greece is Greek;\n\n\ntherefore,\n\n(3)\nthe president of Greece is mortal.\n\n\nTo grant compositionality in a way that respects the syntactic\nsimilarity of the three sentences (they all have the same\nsubject-predicate form), and the validity of the argument, Montague\nassociates (1)\u2013(3) to formulas such as these:\n\\[ \\tag{1a} [\\lambda F \\forall x(\\mathrm{G}(x) \\rightarrow\nF(x)](\\mathrm{M}); \\] \\[ \\tag{2a} [\\lambda F \\exists x(\\forall y(P(x)\n\\rightarrow x = y) \\amp F(x))](G); \\] \\[ \\tag{3a} [\\lambda F \\exists\nx(\\forall y(P(x) \\rightarrow x = y) \\amp F(x))](\\mathrm{M}). \\]\n\nThe three lambda abstracts in (1a)\u2013(3a) represent, respectively,\nthe meanings of the three noun phrases in (1)\u2013(3). These\nlambda-abstracts occur in predicate position, as predicates of\npredicates, so that (1a)\u2013(3a) can be read, respectively, as:\nevery Greek is instantiated by being mortal; the\npresident of Greece is instantiated by being Greek;\nthe president of Greece is instantiated by being\nmortal. Given lambda-conversion plus quantifier and propositional\nlogic, the argument is valid, as desired. It should be noted that\nlambda abstracts such as these can be taken to stand for peculiar\nproperties of properties, classifiable as denoting concepts\n(after Russell 1903; see Cocchiarella 1989). One may then say then\nthis approach to semantics makes a case for the postulation of\ndenoting concepts, in addition to the more obvious and general fact\nthat it grants properties as meanings of natural language predicates\n(represented by symbols of the formal language).\n\nThis in itself says nothing about the nature of such properties. As we\nsaw in\n \u00a73.1,\n Montague took them to be intensions as set-theoretically\ncharacterized in terms of possible worlds. Moreover, he took them to\nbe typed, since, to avoid logical paradoxes, he relied on type theory.\nAfter Montague, these two assumptions have been typically taken for\ngranted in natural language semantics, though with attempts to recover\nhyperintensionality somehow (Cresswell 1985) in order to capture the\nsemantics of propositional attitudes verbs such as\n\u201cbelieve\u201d, affected by the phenomena regarding mental\ncontent hinted at in\n \u00a73.1.\n However, the development of type-free property theories has suggested\nthe radically different road of relying on them to provide logical\nforms for natural language semantics (Chierchia 1985; Chierchia &\nTurner 1988; Orilia 2000b; Orilia & Landini 2019). This allows one\nto capture straightforwardly natural language inferences that appear\nto presuppose type-freedom, as they feature quantifiers that bind\nsimultaneously subject and predicate positions (recall the example of\n \u00a71.2).\n Moreover, by endowing the selected type-free property theory with\nfine-grained identity conditions, one also accounts for propositional\nattitude verbs (Bealer 1989). Thus, we may say that this line makes a\ncase for properties understood as untyped and highly fine-grained.\n6.3 Foundations of Mathematics\n\nSince the systematization in the first half of last century, which\ngave rise to paradox-free axiomatizations of set\ntheory such as ZFC, sets are\ntypically taken for granted in the foundations of mathematics and it\nis well known that they can do all the works that numbers can do. This\nhas led to the proposal of identifying numbers with sets.\nRussell\u2019s type theory was an alternative that rather relied on\nproperties (viewed as propositional functions), in backing up a\nlogicist reduction of mathematics to logic. In essence, the idea was\nthat properties can do all the work that sets are supposed to do, thus\nmaking the latter dispensable. Hence, Russell spoke of his approach as\na \u201cno-classes\u201d theory of classes (see Landini 2011: 115,\nand \u00a72.4 of the entry on\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism;\n cf. Bealer 1982: 111\u2013119, and Jubien 1989 for followers of this\nline). Following this line, numbers are then seen as properties rather\nthan sets.\n\nThe Russellian approach did not encounter among mathematicians a\nsuccess comparable to that of set theory. Nevertheless, from an\nontological point of view, it appears to be more economical in its\nrelying on properties, to the extent that the latter are needed any\nway for all sorts of explanatory jobs, reviewed above, which sets,\nqua extensional entities, can hardly perform. As we have\nseen, type theory is problematic. However, type-free property theories\ncan come to the rescue by replacing typed properties with untyped ones\nin the foundations of mathematics. And in fact the advocates of such\ntheories have often proposed to recover the logicist program, in\nparticular by identifying natural numbers with untyped properties of\nproperties (Bealer 1982; Cocchiarella 1986b; Orilia 2000b).
