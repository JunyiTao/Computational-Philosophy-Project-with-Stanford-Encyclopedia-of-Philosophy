    "main_text": "Explaining Supervenience\n6. Explaining Supervenience\n\n\nNon-naturalism has trouble explaining the necessary dependence of\nthe moral facts on the natural facts. So long as our characterization\nof natural properties is broad enough to include both all of the mental\nproperties and all of the properties that would figure in the best\nphysical theory, it is very plausible to suppose that the moral\nsupervenes on the natural in the following sense: there can be no moral\ndifference between two situations or entire possible worlds without\nsome natural difference but not vice-versa (there can be non-moral\ndifferences without moral differences). On some ways of understanding\nthe natural properties, of course, it is unclear whether mental\nproperties are natural ones and this is an important point. Perhaps\nmental properties elude scientific investigation but are real\nnonetheless. If we characterize the non-natural properties as ones that\nelude scientific investigation then mental properties will be\nnon-natural ones. This is very important since it is not nearly so\nplausible that the moral supervenes on a set of facts that does not\ninclude the mental facts\u2014as if the wrongness of an action could\nfloat independently of facts about pain, intentions and beliefs. For\npurposes of the present discussion I shall simply assume that the\nnatural properties include the mental properties.\n\n\nHowever, suitably formulated theses concerning the supervenience of\nthe moral on the natural are plausible enough that some philosophers\nhave held them to be analytic. Global supervenience theses are perhaps\nthe most plausible ones, claiming merely that two entire possible\nworlds cannot differ only in their moral properties without\nalso differing in some of their natural properties. To deny this thesis\nwould be to allow that it could have been the case that the world was\nexactly like the actual world in all of its naturalistic\nfeatures but in that world what Hitler did was not wrong. Since all the\nnatural facts are the same in this possible world it will still be true\nthat Hitler killed the same people, had the same intentions, etc. Such\nbare moral differences seem inconceivable. Very plausibly, the moral\nfacts are in some way entirely fixed by the natural facts. The problem\nfor the non-naturalist is that non-naturalism seems unable to explain\nthis supervenience. For if moral properties and natural properties\nreally are, in Hume\u2019s terms, \u201cdistinct existences\u201d then it is hard to\nsee why it should be impossible for the former to differ with no\ndifference in the latter and since the natural properties are non-moral\nones (given non-naturalism) this makes supervenience seem problematic.\nNon-naturalism\u2019s apparent inability to explain such a basic platitude\nas global supervenience poses a serious problem (see Mackie 1977,\nBlackburn 1984, and Blackburn 1988).\n\n\nNaturalists of course can explain supervenience much more easily.\nFor given naturalism, the moral properties just are certain\nnatural properties, and the supervenience of the moral follows\ntrivially from this (every property supervenes on itself). It is much\nless obvious, however, that the naturalist can explain a slightly\ndifferent supervenience thesis. For it seems at least as plausible to\nsuppose that the moral properties supervene on the non-moral ones as it\nis to suppose that they supervene on the natural properties. Indeed,\nthe moral/non-moral supervenience thesis is probably more obviously\ncorrect than moral/natural supervenience theses because of the\nobscurity of the natural/non-natural distinction. Once we divide the\nnatural properties into the moral and the non-moral, it becomes unclear\nwhy the moral properties should supervene on all the other\nnatural properties (the non-moral ones). Perhaps the naturalist\u2019s\ndialectical advantage is more modest than one would have thought. For\nif neither naturalists nor non-naturalists can explain the\nsupervenience of the moral on the non-moral and if that supervenience\nthesis is less controversial than moral/natural supervenience theses\nthen the fact that the naturalist can explain the latter looks less\nimpressive.\n Perhaps non-cognitivists (or \u201cquasi-realists,\u201d in\nBlackburn\u2019s favored terminology; see Blackburn 1984) and error\ntheorists reap the greatest dialectical dividends from reflection on\nhow we might explain supervenience. The standard view is that the\nnon-cognitivist\u2019s explanatory task differs from the explanatory task\nfacing both naturalist and non-naturalist forms of cognitivism.\nWhereas the naturalist and non-naturalist must explain a metaphysical\nrelationship between two potentially distinct sets of properties the\nnon-cognitivist instead needs only to explain the sensibility of a\npractice of moralizing governed by a supervenience constraint. Since\none of the main points of moral discourse is to recommend options on\nthe basis of their natural properties it is easy enough to see why\nsuch a constraint is sensible. To abandon that constraint would be to\nabandon the project of moralizing so understood. For if our practice\nof moralizing were not to include such a constraint then you could\nevaluate options differently even if they were identical in all their\nnatural properties and this would make it hard to see in what sense\noptions were being recommended on the basis of their natural\nproperties. Since for the non-cognitivist there are no moral\nproperties (from the perspective of serious metaphysics, anyway; but\nwe can still \u201cspeak with the vulgar\u201d as if there were such\nproperties) we can in the same way derive that our moralizing must not\nallow that two items identical in their non-moral properties might\nstill differ morally. For the point of moralizing is to recommend\noptions on the basis of their natural properties and all the natural\nproperties are non-moral according to the non-cognitivist.  One worry\nabout this line of argument is that quasi-realist expressivism, if\nsuccessful, allows us to make all of the original and seemingly\nmetaphysically problematic claims about moral reality in the only\nsense in which those claims can be understood.  In that case, it\nis not entirely obvious why the quasi-realist does not, at the end of\nthe day, face exactly the same explanatory burden as the\nnon-naturalist realist (see Street 2011).  Perhaps quasi-realists can\navoid this specific worry about self-defeat by holding that moral\nproperties are, after all, natural properties on their view.  The view\ncan remain expressivist so long as it also maintains that taking a\nview about just which natural property is identical to a given moral\nproperty is constituted by adopting suitable non-cognitive\nattitudes.\n\n\nLike the non-cognitivist, the error theorist denies that there any\nmoral properties, but unlike the non-cognitivist maintains that the\nlegitimacy of moral discourse presupposes that there are such\nproperties. This trivially entails that whenever there is a moral\ndifference there must be some non-moral difference for the simple\nreason that there never can be any moral differences between cases\ngiven the error theory. Typically, the error theorist agrees with the\nnon-naturalist (implicitly, anyway) about the semantics of moral\npredicates but holds that moral predicates do not refer precisely\nbecause moral properties to which they purport to refer would have to\nbe so queer (see Mackie 1977). One aspect of the putative queerness of\nmoral properties is the idea that they necessarily supervene on the\nnatural (and non-moral) properties without being reducible to those\nproperties.\n\n\nHow might non-naturalists respond to the charge that they cannot\nexplain supervenience? They might argue that the objection must be\nunsound because it would prove too much. For the form of the argument\nseems to generalize into an argument that no class of properties can\nsupervene on another class of properties unless the former are\nreducible to the latter in some way. It might seem in some of the cases\nnot involving moral properties that this cannot be correct. The\nsupervenience of the property of being a chair on all of the properties\nof microphysics seems unlikely to be explained in some reductive way\nbut seems obviously correct nonetheless. Non-naturalist\u2019s critics can\neither accept this implication of their argument but try to argue that\nit is not so implausible or try to block the implication in some way. A\ndiscussion of the former strategy raises very general questions that go\nwell beyond the scope of the present article. So I shall here focus on\nthe question of whether the moral case is in some way unique even\nthough the more promising strategy here might be to argue that in these\nother cases some sort of reductive (albeit perhaps non-analytic)\naccount is available after all.\n\n\nArguably the moral case is different from these other cases of\nsupervenience without reduction because the supervenience of the moral\non the natural (and non-moral) is analytic. Plausibly, someone who\nthinks two things could differ morally but be identical in all other\nrespects does not fully grasp the meanings of moral predicates. This is\nnot nearly so plausible in other cases in which we seem to have\nsupervenience without reduction. Cartesian dualists can deny\nsupervenience and their view does not seem conceptually incoherent\nhowever mistaken it may be. As Blackburn argues, if this sort of error\nis a conceptual one then \u201cwhole cultures have been prone to denial of\nan analytic truth\u201d (Blackburn 1985: 59) which at best seems unlikely.\nThe idea here seems to be that the only way a realist could explain\nsupervenience qua analytic truth would be to hold that the moral is\nanalytically identical to some property that can also be characterized\nin purely naturalistic terms. The non-naturalist, of course, is\ncommitted to rejecting any such analyses so if this is the only way to\nexplain the analyticity of supervenience then non-naturalists cannot\nexplain it. In which case, the appeal to analyticity might seem to\nblock the \u2018proves too much objection\u2019.\n\n\nHowever, this would be too quick. Blackburn\u2019s appeal to the\nanalyticity of supervenience in the moral case notwithstanding, the\n\u2018proves to much\u2019 objection can be reinstated against Blackburn\u2019s\noriginal argument that non-naturalists (and moral realists more\ngenerally) cannot explain supervenience. For the non-naturalist might\ninstead hold that the analyticity of supervenience simply falls out of\nthe conventions governing our use of moral vocabulary. It is simply an\nempirical fact that those we take to be competent users of moral\nlanguage do respect supervenience constraints and would think anyone\nwho did not respect those constraints must be conceptually confused. As\nThomas Baldwin argues, \u201cThe realist can maintain that it is a\nconceptual truth that there are necessary connections between the\nethical and the non-ethical, even though the particular connections\nthemselves are not analytically necessary.\u201d (Baldwin 1990: 99) In which\ncase, the appeal to analyticity seems not to help block the objection\nthat the argument from supervenience proves too much. One might\nbuttress this defense of non-naturalism by pointing out that it does\nseem analytic that moral properties are \u201cresultant\u201d ones in Jonathan\nDancy\u2019s sense\u2014the instantiation of a moral property must always be\nexplained by the instantiation of certain particular non-moral\nproperties.\n\n\nNonetheless, Baldwin is mistaken to suppose that this entirely\ndisarms the argument from supervenience. Baldwin might well show that\nBlackburn cannot escape the charge of proving too much simply by\nappealing to the thesis that supervenience in the moral case is a\npriori. Showing that Blackburn\u2019s move does not explain why the argument\nwould not prove too much still does not provide a satisfactory defense\nof non-naturalism, though. For if the non-naturalist simply appeals to\nconventional and linguistic facts then they might well explain why it\nis analytic that if there are any moral properties then they\nmust supervene on the natural (and non-moral) ones. The original\nobjection, though, was a metaphysical one rather than a semantic one.\nThe problem for the non-naturalist now becomes one of explaining how\nthe non-natural properties in question could satisfy the relevant\nsupervenience constraints and hence count as moral in the first place.\nThe challenge is to provide a metaphysical account of how there could\nbe properties like the properties to which the non-naturalist maintains\nour moral vocabulary purports to refer. Otherwise we are left either\nwith the error-theoretic conclusion that there are no moral properties\nor the non-cognitivist conclusion that moral vocabulary does not even\npurport to refer (in the sense of \u2018refer\u2019 in play when one\ndoes serious metaphysics, anyway; again, the non-cognitivist will allow\nthat we can \u2018speak with the vulgar\u2019 here). So there is\nstill a problem for the non-naturalist. Nonetheless, Baldwin seems\nright in that the appeal to analyticity seems not to have done the work\nfor which it was invoked by Blackburn. For it again seems as if the\nargument from supervenience generalizes to other cases of supervenience\nwithout reduction. Perhaps the non-naturalist\u2019s critics should simply\nembrace this implication but argue that the prospects for reduction in\nthese other cases are much brighter than the non-naturalist suggests\nthey are.\n\n\nA more promising approach for the non-naturalist would be to offer a\npositive explanation of supervenience in explicitly non-naturalist\nterms.  In his systematic defence of non-naturalist moral realism,\nRuss Shafer-Landau takes just this strategy.  There he argues that\nalthough each moral property is distinct from any natural property or\nproperties, still each instantiation of a moral property is fully\nconstituted (or, as he sometimes puts it, \u2018realized\u2019) by some\nconcatenation of natural properties (see Shafer-Landau 2003: 76\u201378).\nIn effect, the idea is to distinguish types from tokens, and argue\nthat the constitution of every token moral property by some\nconcatenation of natural properties is consistent with the\nnon-identity of that moral property with any natural property or\ncombination of natural properties.  Shafer-Landau suggests that this\nstrategy is the most plausible one for explaining supervenience\nwithout reduction in the philosophy of mind, and that this should make\nus optimistic about the prospects of an analogous strategy in the\nmoral case.\n\n\nAs I have argued elsewhere, it is not at all clear that the appeal to\ntoken constitution can do the needed work.  Moreover, even if this\nappeal could somehow explain supervenience, it would have further\nunfortunate consequences for the non-naturalist.  Since I have\ndiscussed these objections at length elsewhere (Ridge 2007), I shall\nbe brief here and simply summarize the main worries.  First,\nShafer-Landau\u2019s constitution thesis by itself does not entail\nsupervenience.  A full explanation of supervenience will require some\nauxiliary premises, and Shafer-Landau does not tell us what these\npremises are.  Fortunately, his appeal to an analogy with the\nphilosophy of mind helps us fill in the blanks.  For the closest\nanalogue there seems to be David Robb\u2019s attempt to explain\nsupervenience without reduction in the philosophy of mind in terms of\ntropes, where tropes just are property instantiations.  Trying to\ncarry out the Robb strategy (which I shall not try to summarize here;\nfor details, see Robb 1997), the needed premise for Shafer-Landau would\nseem to be that if a given natural trope constitutes a moral trope,\nthen it necessarily constitutes that trope.  This, plus\nShafer-Landau\u2019s thesis that necessarily, every moral trope is fully\nconstituted by some set of natural tropes, would indeed entail\nsupervenience, so this does seem like an interesting way to fill out\nthe details of his strategy.\n\n\nWhy, though, should we suppose that this necessitation thesis (that if\none trope is fully constituted by another trope, then it necessarily\nis) is true?  Robb\u2019s own thesis was actually about trope identity\nrather than trope constitution, and this gives Robb\u2019s thesis more\nimmediate plausibility, as identity does seem to be necessary.\nShafer-Landau, however, wants to appeal to constitution rather than\nidentity (this is a departure from Robb), and this makes it very\nunclear why we should accept the analogous necessitation thesis.\n\n\nA second possible worry about Shafer-Landau\u2019s strategy is that it does\nrely on a metaphysics which quantifies over tropes (Shafer-Landau\nprefers to speak of \u2018property instantiations\u2019 but this is\nreally a merely nominal difference).  This is itself a controversial\nmetaphysical commitment.  Moreover, Shafer-Landau seems committed to\nmeta-tropes\u2014tropes of tropes.  For he needs this thesis to explain\nhow a fact (which for Shafer-Landau just is a property instantiation)\ncan itself have the property of being a reason.  While this is of\ncourse a metaphysical commitment that can perhaps be defended, it does\ngive some dialectical hostages to fortune.\n\n\nThird, Shafer-Landau\u2019s approach seems to have the very odd consequence\nthat certain forms of first-order monism are ruled out.  Shafer-Landau\nhimself explicitly claims that his theory can be neutral on this\nfront, and it would be unfortunate if his theory did have such\nstriking implications for first-order theory.  Why do I say that\nShafer-Landau\u2019s theory seems to lead very quickly to the rejection of\ncertain forms of monism?  Because on a standard view of tropes, a\nproperty (that is, a type) just is a resembling set of tropes.  In\nthis context, whether a given property is moral or natural will depend\nupon whether the relevant sort of resemblance is one which is\nespecially salient from the point of view of moral theory, on the one\nhand, or from the point of view of one of the natural sciences.  It\ncould be relevant from the point of view of both such perspectives,\nbut this would be for naturalism to be true, which, of course, is\ninconsistent with non-naturalism!  The main point is that for any\nnaturalist view which holds that something is good if and only if it\ninstantiates some particular single natural property (pleasantness,\nsay), it would follow that the relevant sort of resemblance would be\nsalient from the perspective of one of the natural sciences.  For all\npleasantness tropes do resemble one another in a way which would be\nsalient from the point of view of psychology (or possibly\nbiology)\u2014or at least, insofar as pleasantness is a natural\nproperty this is likely to be so.  In which case, a standard view of\ntropes would entail that the property itself is a natural one.  In\nwhich case, we would have a form of reductive naturalism.  So for this\nstrategy to work, it seems that any form of first-order monism which\nholds that things are good if and only if they instantiate some single\nnatural property, must be rejected.  Otherwise we end up with a form\nof naturalism, rather than non-naturalism.  Insofar as the\nnon-naturalist (quite rightly) aspires to remain neutral on such\nfirst-order questions, this is a theoretical vice of the proposed\nexplanation.\n\n\nObviously there is a lot more that can be said by both parties to this\ndebate.  For example, for useful more recent discussion of the more\ngeneral issue of whether there can be necessary connections between\ndistinct existences, see Wilson 2010.  In any event, it is good that\nnon-naturalists in moral philosophy are not merely relying on the\nappeal to companions in guilt, but are also actually offering positive\nexplanations of supervenience.  Shafer-Landau offers an ambitious\nexplanation of supervenience in non-naturalist terms.  Even if his\ninitial strategy fails for some of the reasons discussed above, it at\nleast is a step in the right direction, and it might be possible to\nrefine his strategy in a way to avoid some or all of the worries\nraised above.  It is early days for this approach to supervenience in\nthe case of moral philosophy, and it will be interesting to see how\nthis debate plays out.  For further discussion of Shafer-Landau\u2019s\nstrategy here, see also Mabrito 2005, Shafer-Landau 2005, Wedgwood\n2009 and McPherson 2012. Useful discussion can also be found in Dreier 2019, Gert 2019, and Moberger 2019. \n",
