Researchers in the 1950s discovered that sleep is not a uniform\nstate of rest and passivity, but there is a sleep architecture\ninvolving different stages of sleep that is relatively stable both\nwithin and across individuals (Aserinsky & Kleitman 1953, 1955;\nDement & Kleitman 1957). Following sleep onset, periods of non-REM\n(or NREM) sleep including slow wave sleep (so called because of the\npresence of characteristic slow-wave, high-voltage EEG activity) are\nfollowed by periods of high-frequency, low-voltage activity during REM\nsleep. EEG measures from REM sleep strongly resemble waking EEG. REM\nsleep is additionally characterized by rapid eye movements and a\nnear-complete loss of muscle tone (Dement 1999: 27\u201350; Jouvet\n1999).\n\nThe alignment between conscious experience on the one hand and\nwake-like brain activity and muscular paralysis on the other hand\nwould seem to support the experiential status of dreams as well as\nexplain the outward passivity that typically accompanies them. Reports\nof dreaming are in fact much more frequent following REM (81.9%) than\nNREM sleep awakenings (43%; Nielsen 2000). REM reports tend to be more\nelaborate, vivid, and emotionally intense, whereas NREM reports tend\nto be more thought-like, confused, non-progressive, and repetitive\n(Hobson et al. 2000). These differences led to the idea that REM sleep\nis an objective marker of dreaming (Dement & Kleitman 1957; Hobson\n1988: 154).\n\nAttempts to identify dreaming with mental activity during REM sleep\nhave not, however, been successful, and many now hold that dreams can\noccur in all stages of sleep (e.g., Antrobus 1990; Foulkes 1993b;\nSolms 1997, 2000; Domhoff 2003; Nemeth & Fazekas 2018). In recent\nyears there has been renewed interest in NREM sleep for the study of\ndreaming (Noreika et al. 2009; Siclari et al. 2013, 2017). This\nsuggests the inference from the physiology of REM sleep to the\nphenomenology of dreaming is not straightforward.\n\nA second line of evidence comes from lucid dreams, or dreams in which\none knows one is dreaming and often has some level of dream control\n(Voss et al. 2013; Voss & Hobson 2015; Baird et al. 2019). The\nterm lucid dreaming was coined by van Eeden (1913), but Aristotle\n(On Dreams) already noted that one can sometimes be aware\nwhile dreaming that one is dreaming.\n\nScientific evidence that lucid dreaming is real and a genuine sleep\nphenomenon comes from laboratory studies (Hearne 1978; LaBerge et al.\n1981) showing lucid dreamers can use specific, pre-arranged patterns\nof eye movements (e.g., right-left-right-left) to signal in real-time\nthat they are now lucid and engaging in dream experiments. These\nsignals are clearly identifiable on the EOG and suggest a\ncorrespondence between dream-eye movements and real-eye movements (as\npredicted by the so-called scanning hypothesis; see Dement\n& Kleitman 1957; Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Retrospective\nreports confirm that the dreamer really was lucid and signalled\nlucidity (Dresler et al. 2012; Stumbrys et al. 2014).\n\nSignal-verified lucid dreams have been used to study muscular activity\naccompanying body movements in dreams (Erlacher et al. 2003; Dresler\net al. 2011), for advanced EEG analysis of brain activity during lucid\ndreaming (Voss et al. 2009), and imaging studies (Dresler et al. 2011,\n2012). Eye signals can also be used to measure the duration of\ndifferent activities performed in lucid dreams; contrary to the\ncassette theory, lucid dreams have temporal extension and certain\ndream actions even seem to take slightly longer than in waking\n(Erlacher et al. 2014). There have also been attempts to induce\nlucidity through non-invasive electrical stimulation during sleep\n(Stumbrys et al. 2013; Voss et al. 2014). The combination of\nsignal-verified lucid dreaming with volitional control over dream\ncontent, retrospective report, and objective sleep measures has been\nproposed to provide controlled conditions for the study of conscious\nexperience in sleep and a new methodology for investigating the\nrelationship between conscious experience and neurophysiological\nprocesses (Baird et al.2019).\n\nA third line of evidence (Revonsuo 2006: 77) comes from\ndream-enactment behavior (Nielsen et al. 2009), most prominently in\npatients with REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD; Schenck & Mahowald\n1996; Schenck 2005; Leclair-Visonneau et al. 2010). Due to a loss of\nthe muscular atonia that accompanies REM sleep in healthy subjects,\nthese patients show complex, seemingly goal-directed outward behaviors\nsuch as running or fighting off an attacker during REM sleep.\nRetrospective dream reports often match these behaviors, suggesting\nthat patients literally act out their dreams during sleep.\n\nWhile persuasive, these lines of evidence might not satisfy skeptics\nabout dream experience. They might worry that results from lucid\ndreaming and dream enactment do not generalize to ordinary, non-lucid\ndreams; they might also construe alternative explanations that do not\nrequire conscious experience in sleep. There are also methodological\nconcerns, for instance about how closely sleep-behaviors actually\nmatch dream experience. A key issue is that to support the\nexperiential status of dreams, evidence from sleep polysomnography,\nsignal verified lucid dreams, or sleep behavior requires convergence\nwith retrospective dream reports. This means trusting dream reports is\nbuilt into any attempt to empirically resolve the question of dream\nexperience \u2013 which then invites the familiar skeptical concerns.\nAgain, an anti-skeptical strategy may be to appeal to explanatory\nconsiderations. In this view, the convergence of dream reports and\nobjective polysomnographic or behavioral observations is best\nexplained by the assumption that dreams are experiences in sleep, and\nthis assumption is strengthened by further incoming findings. This\nstrategy places dream reports at the center of scientific dream\nresearch while avoiding the contentious claim that their\ntrustworthiness, and with it the experiential status of dreams, can be\ndemonstrated conclusively by independent empirical means (Windt 2013,\n2015a). \n",
