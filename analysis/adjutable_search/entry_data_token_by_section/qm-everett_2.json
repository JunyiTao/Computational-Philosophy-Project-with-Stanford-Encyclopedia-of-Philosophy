    "main_text": "Everett\u2019s Deduction\n3. Everett\u2019s Deduction\n\nIn order to solve the measurement problem, Everett proposed dropping\nthe collapse dynamics (rule 4b) from the standard collapse theory and\ntaking the resulting theory to provide a complete and accurate\ndescription of all physical systems at all times. He called the\nresultant theory pure wave mechanics. Everett believed that\nhe could deduce the standard statistical predictions of quantum\nmechanics, the predictions that depend on rule 4b in the standard\ncollapse formulation, in terms of the subjective experiences of\nobservers who are themselves treated as ordinary physical systems\nwithin pure wave mechanics. We will discuss how this deduction was\nsupposed to work in some detail.\n\nEverett sketched the outline of his deduction in the long thesis:\n\nWe shall be able to introduce into [pure wave mechanics] systems which\nrepresent observers. Such systems can be conceived as automatically\nfunctioning machines (servomechanisms) possessing recording devices\n(memory) and which are capable of responding to their environment. The\nbehavior of these observers shall always be treated within the\nframework of wave mechanics. Furthermore, we shall deduce the\nprobabilistic assertions of Process 1 [rule 4b] as subjective\nappearances to such observers, thus placing the theory in\ncorrespondence with experience. We are then led to the novel situation\nin which the formal theory is objectively continuous and causal, while\nsubjectively discontinuous and probabilistic. While this point of view\nthus shall ultimately justify our use of the statistical assertions of\nthe orthodox view, it enables us to do so in a logically consistent\nmanner, allowing for the existence of other observers (1956,\n77\u20138).\n\n\nMore specifically, Everett\u2019s goal was to show that the relative\nrecords of a typical observer in pure wave mechanics would exhibit the\nstatistical properties predicted by the collapse dynamics. In order to\nso, he needed to supplement pure wave mechanics with a small handful\nof background assumptions.\n\nExpressed in the language of his Wigner\u2019s Friend story, Everett\ninsisted on three things: (1) there are no collapses of the\nquantum-mechanical state, hence observer \\(B\\) is correct in\nattributing to \\(A{+}S\\) a state where observer \\(A\\) is in an\nentangled superposition of having recorded mutually incompatible\nresults, (2) there is a sense in which \\(A\\) nevertheless gets a\nperfectly determinate measurement record, and (3) typical sequences of\nsuch records will satisfy the standard quantum statistics.\n\nThe main task in understanding what Everett had in mind is in figuring\nout precisely how the correspondence between the predictions of the\nstandard collapse theory and those of pure wave mechanics was supposed\nto work. One problem is that the former theory is stochastic with\nfundamentally chance events while the latter is deterministic with no\nmention of probabilities whatsoever. Another is that since an observer\nlike \\(A\\) will typically fail to have any determinate record on the\nstandard interpretation of states, one needs a new way of\nunderstanding the post-measurement state of the composite system\n\\(A{+}S\\), a way that provides a sense in which \\(A\\) might be said to\nhave a determinate measurement record.\n\nConsider measuring the \\(x\\)-spin of a spin-\u00bd system. Such a\nsystem will be found to be either \u201c\\(x\\)-spin up\u201d or\n\u201c\\(x\\)-spin down\u201d. Suppose that \\(J\\) is a good observer.\nFor Everett, being a good \\(x\\)-spin observer meant that \\(J\\) has the\nfollowing two dispositions, where the arrows below represent the\ntime-evolution of the composite system as described by rule 4a:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} &|\\ldquo\\mbox{ready}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S \\rightarrow |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S \\\\\n \\tag{2} &|\\ldquo\\mbox{ready}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S \\rightarrow |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S \n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nSo if \\(J\\) measures a system that is determinately \\(x\\)-spin up,\nthen \\(J\\) will determinately record \u201c\\(x\\)-spin up\u201d; and\nif \\(J\\) measures a system that is determinately \\(x\\)-spin down, then\n\\(J\\) will determinately record \u201c\\(x\\)-spin down\u201d. And in\neach case we will suppose that the spin of the object system \\(S\\) is\nundisturbed by the interaction.\n\nNow consider what happens when \\(J\\) observes the \\(x\\)-spin of a\nsystem that begins in a superposition of \\(x\\)-spin eigenstates:\n\n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + |\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nThe initial state of the composite system is: \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{ready}\\rdquo\\rangle_J \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S + |\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nHere \\(J\\) is determinately ready to make an \\(x\\)-spin measurement,\nbut the object system \\( S\\), according to rule 3, has no determinate\n\\(x\\)-spin. Given \\(J\\)\u2019s two dispositions and the fact that the\ndeterministic dynamics (rule 4a) is linear, the state of the composite\nsystem after her \\(x\\)-spin measurement will be: \n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J\n|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S + |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nCall this state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) . On the standard formulation of\nquantum mechanics, at some point during the measurement interaction\nthe state collapses resulting in either \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J |\\mbox{$x$-spin\nup}\\rangle_S\\]\n\n\nor \n\\[|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rangle_S,\\]\n\n\neach with probability 1/2. In the former case, \\(J\\) ends up with the\ndeterminate measurement record \u201cspin up\u201d, and in the later\nshe ends up with the determinate measurement record \u201cspin\ndown\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, no such collapse occurs on Everett\u2019s proposal.\nRather, the post-measurement state of the composite system is\n\\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\), the state resulting from the linear dynamics\nalone, an entangled superposition of \\(J\\) recording the result\n\u201cspin up\u201d and \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin up and \\(J\\)\nrecording \u201cspin down\u201d and \\(S\\) being \\(x\\)-spin down. On\nthe standard interpretation of states (rule 3), \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is\nnot a state where \\(J\\) determinately records \u201cspin up\u201d\nnor is it a state where \\(J\\) determinately records \u201cspin\ndown\u201d. Indeed, it is not even a state where \\(J\\) has a\ndeterminate state to call her own as the state of the\ncomposite system does not factor.\n\nFurther, Everett held that one might, at least in principle, show by\nmeans of a Wigner\u2019s Friend interference experiment that the\npost-measurement state is in fact \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\). Consider an\nobservable \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) of the composite system \\(J{+}S\\) that\nhas state \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) as an eigenstate corresponding to\neigenvalue +1 and the orthogonal state \n\\[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rdquo\\rangle_J\n|\\mbox{$x$-spin up}\\rangle_S - |\\ldquo\\mbox{$x$-spin\ndown}\\rdquo\\rangle_J|\\mbox{$x$-spin down}\\rangle_S).\\]\n\n\nas an eigenstate corresponding to eigenvalue \\(-1.\\) If Everett is\nright and \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) is in fact the post-measurement state,\nthen an observation of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) would always yield \\(+1.\\)\nBut if a collapse occurs in the interaction between \\(J\\) and \\(S,\\)\nthen an \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\)-measurement might yield \\(+1\\) or \\(-1,\\)\neach with probability 1/2 since the post-measurement collapsed states\nare at 45 degree angles to the rays containing the eigenstates of\n\\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\).\n\nBy insisting that \\(\\boldsymbol{E}\\) was in fact the post-measurement\nstate of the composite system, Everett faced two problems. The\ndeterminate-record problem required him to explain how this\nstate is compatible with observer \\(J\\) having a determinate\nmeasurement record. And the probability problem required him\nto recover, in some sense, the standard quantum probabilities for such\ndeterminate records.\n",
