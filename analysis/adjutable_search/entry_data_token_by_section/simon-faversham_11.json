    "main_text": "Metaphysics || Essence and Being\n5.2 Essence and Being\n\nIn question 20 of his commentary on Aristotle\u2019s\nCategories, Simon argues that substances are either compound\nor simple. In addition, all created substances are a composition of\nessence and being. Compound substances are also composed of matter and\nform. The reason why all created substances are composed of essence\nand being is that being is not part of their essence, but given to\nthem extrinsically by the first being. Thus, Simon strongly suggests\nthat he is committed to the real distinction between essence and\nbeing.\n\nHowever, as John Longeway pointed out in an earlier version of this\nentry, Simon changes his mind about this. This change is evident in\nquestion 49 of his second commentary on the Posterior\nAnalytics, where he addressed the question whether being is\nsomething added to essence. Here, Simon objects Aquinas\u2019s claim\nthat being is something added to essence with the following argument:\n\n\n If added being is something real, then it is actual.\n So, it is either a first or a second actuality.\n Not a first, because a first actuality is not different from the\nessence.\n Not a second, because a second actuality is an operation that\npresupposes actual being.\n Moreover, it cannot be a third actuality, because this is\ncontrary to Aristotelian doctrine (furthermore, it would lead to an\ninfinite regress, as Radulphus Brito would point out).\n Therefore, added being is not something real. (Longeway 2000:\n7\u20138)\n\n\nEven so, Simon still holds that being is something added to created\nbeings. But how, if not as something real? Since we can understand\nwhat a thing is without considering its possible modes of being (i.e.,\nactual, mental etc.), it seems that there is indeed a distinction\nbetween essence and being (cf. Longeway 2000: 9). So, the distinction\nis either notional or real. It is not real, as was shown with the\nargument above. Therefore, the distinction must be notional: since the\ndefinition of an essence does not include being at all, being must be\na notion added to this definition, a notion that refers to the\nrelation of a substance to its cause (cf. Longeway 2000: 10\u201311).\nHence, we can think of a substance as some kind of thing (e.g., a man)\naccording to its essence (esse essentiae), but we can also\nthink of it as something that exists in a causally ordered reality,\naccording to its being in an effect (esse in effectu) (cf.\nLongeway 2000: 13).\n",
