    "main_text": "How Should We Think about the Morality of War? || Institutions and Actions\n2.2 Institutions and Actions\n\nWithin contemporary analytical philosophy, there are two different\nways in which moral and political philosophers think about war (Lazar\nand Valentini forthcoming). On the first, institutionalist,\napproach, philosophers\u2019 primary goal is to establish what the\ninstitutions regulating war should be. In particular, we should\nprescribe morally justified laws of war. We then tell individuals and\ngroups that they ought to follow those laws. On the second approach,\nwe should focus first on the moral reasons that apply directly to\nindividual and group actions, without the mediating factor of\ninstitutions. We tell individuals and groups to act as their moral\nreasons dictate. Since this approach focuses not on the institutions\nthat govern our interactions, but on those interactions themselves, we\nwill call it the \u201cinteractional\u201d\n approach.[6]\n\nIn general, the institutionalist approach is favoured by indirect\nconsequentialists and contractualists. Indirect consequentialists\nbelieve these institutions are justified just in case they will in\nfact have better long-run results than any feasible alternative\ninstitutions (see Mavrodes 1975; Dill and Shue 2012; Shue 2013;\nWaldron 2016). Contractualists believe these institutions ground or\nreflect either an actual or a hypothetical contract among states\nand/or their citizens, which specifies the terms of their interaction\nin war (see Benbaji 2008, 2011, 2014; Statman 2014).\n\nNon-contractualist deontologists and direct- or act-consequentialists\ntend to prefer the interactional approach. Their central question is:\nwhat moral reasons bear directly on the permissibility of killing in\nwar? This focus on killing might seem myopic\u2014war involves much\nmore violence and destruction than the killing alone. However,\ntypically this is just a heuristic device; since we typically think of\nkilling as the most presumptively wrongful kind of harm, whatever\narguments one identifies that justify killing are likely also to\njustify lesser wrongs. And if the killing that war involves cannot be\njustified, then we should endorse pacifism.\n\nAny normative theory of war should pay attention both to what the laws\nof war should be, and to what we morally ought to do. These are two\ndistinct but equally important questions. And they entail the\nimportance of a third: what ought we to do all things considered, for\nexample when law and morality conflict? Too much recent just war\ntheory has focused on arguing that philosophical attention should be\nreserved to one of the first two of these questions (Buchanan 2006;\nShue 2008, 2010; Rodin 2011b). Not enough has concentrated on the\nthird (though see McMahan 2008; Lazar 2012a).\n\nAlthough this entry touches on the first question, it focuses on the\nsecond. Addressing the first requires detailed empirical research and\npragmatic political speculation, both of which are beyond my remit\nhere.  Addressing the third takes us too deep into the minutiae of\ncontemporary just war theory for an encyclopaedia entry.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, even institutionalists need some answer to the\nsecond question\u2014and so some account of the interactional\nmorality of war. Rule-consequentialists need an account of the good\n(bad) that they are hoping that the ideal laws of war will maximise\n(minimise) in the long run. This means, for example, deciding whether\nto aim to minimise all harm, or only to minimise wrongful harm. The\nlatter course is much more plausible\u2014we wouldn\u2019t want laws\nof war that, for example, licensed genocide just in case doing so\nleads to fewer deaths overall. But to follow this course, we need to\nknow which harms are (extra-institutionally) wrongful. Similarly,\ncontractualists typically acknowledge various constraints on the kinds\nof rules that could form the basis of a legitimate contract, which,\nagain, we cannot work out without thinking about the\nextra-institutional morality of war (Benbaji 2011).\n",
