    "main_text": "1860\u20131915\n8. 1860\u20131915\n\n\nBeyond question, one of the particularly acute axial periods of\nhistory for people of African descent in the United States of America\nwas that of the half-decade of civil war (1860\u20131865) continued through\nensuing years of Reconstruction-struggles between White proponents of a\nculture of aspiring aristocratic genteel racial supremacy and a\npolitical economy devoted to developing industrial and finance\ncapitalism in the North and East of the country who also wanted to preserve\nthe federated union of states, and White proponents of a regional\ncivilization devoted to a decidedly pronounced and violently\naristocratic Southern hegemonic White Racial Supremacy based on a\npolitical economy of agrarian capitalism supported by enslaved Negro\nlabor, proponents who forged a Confederacy out of states that seceded\nfrom the Union in order to preserve their distinctive civilizational\nproject. For a great many Black people, the hope was that the Union\nforces would prevail in the war, the institution of slavery would be\nabolished, and they would be freed and free to enjoy lives of full\ncitizenship. More than a few devoted themselves, in various ways, to\naiding the Union efforts, some even as fighting soldiers. Frederick\nDouglass played a major role in persuading President Abraham Lincoln to\nallow Negro men to join the Union army as fighting soldiers and in\npersuading many men to join. With President Lincoln\u2019s\nissuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 freeing the slaves in\nthe Confederate states and Union victory in the Civil War two years\nlater, the day of Jubilation! for Black people and other\nopponents of the institution of slavery appeared to be at hand.\n\n\nAnd so it seemed. There followed a brief, euphoric period of statutory\nfreedom during which Black people held elective and appointive offices\nin many states that had been part of the Confederacy and otherwise\nmade initial significant gains in other areas of life.  However, a\npost-war (1877) so-called compromise between Republican economic and\npolitical forces in the North and East and those of Democrats in the\nSouth settled a disputed presidential election (a contest Republican\nRutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden) and allowed a South\nnot completely vanquished by the lost war to regain power in its\nregion in exchange for Republican hegemony in the federal\ngovernment.\n\n\nViolent terrorism and brutal repression of Negroes followed\nimmediately, in the South especially, which spawned two decades (mid\n1860s-1880s) of post-Reconstruction struggles by newly-emancipated\nBlack people to survive conditions in which they had been set adrift by\nmany former allies in the North and East and were being pressed back\ninto near-slavery by forces in the South. A Great Migration ensued as\nhundreds of thousands of Negroes left the South for hoped-for better\nopportunities without racial violence in the East, North, Southwest,\nand West of the United States, in some cases in response to persuasive\narticulations by various spokespersons (Edward W. Blyden, James T.\nHolly, and Alexander Crummell, among others) who renewed calls for\nvarious programs of emigration or what some scholars have termed\nseparatist Black Nationalism: migrations within and out of the\ncountry to sites on which all-Black communities and towns would be\nformed (away from the United States in Africa; within the country in\nKansas and Oklahoma, for example).\n\n\nMigrations within the United States were by far the most significant\nof the relocations. And the movements greatly accelerated over the\ndecades as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth and the\nU.S. American economy was undergoing transformation into an industrial\ngiant and international power as a consequence of meeting the needs of\nproduction to support the country\u2019s participation in the First\nWorld War and other developments. In the North, Northeast, and West of\nthe country this industrialization created historic demands for workers\nand, subsequently, historic opportunities for work. Meanwhile, in the\nSouth rapidly increasing mechanization in agriculture and subsequent\ndecreasing reliance on the labor of nearly-enslaved, hyper-exploited\nNegro tenant farmers and workers, and increasing industrialization in\nthe region, left the greater majority of Black people in dire straits.\nThese developments, combined with hopes for life unrestricted by racial\nsegregation enforced by brutal violence, by lynchings especially,\nexerted additional pull-and-push forces that prompted hundreds of\nthousands to join in the migrations to the country\u2019s industrial\ncenters.\n\n\nIn settling in the new locales, the migrants and their subsequent\ngenerations began to undergo what, with hindsight, became a historic\nand wrenching transformation of what had been, for the most part, a\nbrutally oppressed, illiterate, yet resolute agrarian peasantry into an\nethno-racial urban working class, and the transformation of a\nsignificant few of them into a modern middle class. With the\ntransformations came vexing challenges and opportunities. Among the\nmost compelling needs were for forms of life appropriate to the new\nurban circumstances\u2014as well as for those who remained in the\nrebuilding South\u2014that would sustain the person and a people and\npromote flourishing life in conditions of intense competition with\nother ethno-racial class groups, and high risks of social\ndisintegration and failure as invidious racism, unchecked by federal\nrestraints, became ever more intense and widespread. There were, then,\ncompelling needs for social and cultural as well as economic support as\nnuclear and extended family units were disrupted in being stretched\nacross long miles of migration and crucial forms of communal and\norganizational support that helped to sustain life in the South were in\nvery short supply in the new urban centers. Once again, in the context\nof demanding needs to be met in the struggle to survive and endure,\nparticularly thoughtful and articulate Black persons took up the\nchallenges of conceiving what was best to be done for the well-being of\nthe race, and how best to achieve well-being.\n\n\nAfrican American women were especially prominent in endeavoring to\nattend thoughtfully and pragmatically to the well-being of the race,\nbut also in endeavoring to make good for Black women on the promises\nof Emancipation for social, political, and economic freedom. An\nexemplary figure in this regard is Anna Julia Cooper (1859?-1964), who\ngraduated from Oberlin College in 1884 and, at age sixty-five,\ncompleted a doctoral dissertation at the Sorbonne on Slavery and\nthe French Revolutionists, 1788\u20131805 (Cooper 1925). A\ncareer educator before earning her doctorate, Cooper was a pioneering\nfeminist who set out a provocative view of what she regarded as the\nsuperior capacity of women to lead the reformation of the human race\nin her book A Voice from South (1892). Poet, journalist,\nnovelist, and essayist Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (1825\u20131911)\nweighed in with a forceful argument that the \u201cspiritual\naid\u201d that women can provide is crucial for moral development and\nthe social advancement of the human race (\u201cWoman\u2019s\nPolitical Future,\u201d 1893). Memphis, Tennessee-born and Oberlin\nCollege-educated Mary Church Terrell (1863\u20131954) lived a stellar\nlife of articulate leadership in uplift and advocacy organizations\ndevoted to the development and well-being of Colored women (Colored\nWomen\u2019s League, the National Association of Colored Women),\ncommitments articulated in \u201cThe Progress of Colored Women\u201d\n(1898, published 1904) and other writings. Fluent in several\nlanguages, Terrell forged relations with Negro and other women in\nseveral countries who worked for reforms on behalf of women.  And\nparticular note must be taken of the audacious, pistol-totting Ida\nB. Wells-Barnett (1862\u20131931), an investigative journalist and\nnewspaperwoman who took it upon herself, as an anti-lynching crusader,\nto investigate cases of lynching across the country to document the\nfacts of each case, which she published in 1895 as The Red Record:\nTabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynching in the United\nStates with an introductory letter from Frederick Douglass, with\nwhom she collaborated in many endeavors. During an especially violent\nand trying period, courageous, thoughtful, and articulate activist\nBlack women such as Wells-Barnett, Cooper, Terrell, and others\ninitiated what would become a long and varied tradition of feminist\nphilosophizing and work by women of African descent devoted to the\nenhancing development of Negro persons, families, organizations, and\ncommunities.\n\n\nFew of these thoughtful feminists, it should be noted, were energetic\nadvocates of Nationalist emigration during this turbulent\nperiod. Perhaps because many Nationalist agendas and articulations\nwere soon eclipsed (though by no means completely silenced) during the\nyears of 1880\u20131915 that came to be largely dominated by the\npersuasive ameliorative leadership of Booker T. Washington\n(1856\u20131915), an educator and strategic power-broker who focused\nhis considerable efforts on uplifting a Black southern peasantry into\neducated literacy for economic self-reliance and on the nation-wide\norganization of Negro businesses for the pursuit of predominance in\ncertain sectors of the economy. After delivering a poignant and crafty\ninvited \u201cAtlanta Exposition Address\u201d to resounding praise\nduring an 1895 international industrial exposition, Washington,\nalready well on his way as a leader recognized as such by Negro\npeople, was elevated by certain powerful and influential White people\nto the vaunted position as their leader and spokesman for\n\u201cthe Negro\u201d to whom they would turn to broker matters in\nrace relations. The key to this positioning was the reaction of many\nWhite people, concerned about post-war transformations under way in\nrace relations, to the following declaration in Washington\u2019s\nExposition address: \u201cIn all things that are purely social we can\nbe as separate as the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things\nessential to mutual progress\u201d (Washington 1895; 1992, p. 358).\nConcentrating on the first part of his statement, anxious White people\ninterpreted his public endorsement of the \u201cpurely social\u201d\nseparation of the races as an endorsement by Washington of the\nhegemony of White people in all areas.\n\n\nIt was not. In fact, Washington was explicit in the address in\ndeclaring that it was \u201cimportant and right that all privileges\nof the law be ours\u2026\u201d He went further in articulating a\nvision of \u201cthat higher good, that, let us pray God, will come in\na blotting out of sectional differences and racial animosities and\nsuspicions, in a determination to administer absolute justice, in a\nwilling obedience among all classes to the mandates of law\u201d\n(Washington 1895; 1992, p. 359).  Hearing, apparently,\nwhat they wanted to hear, not the fullness of\nwhat Washington wanted them to hear, anxious White people of\npower and influence certified him a \u2018good and safe\u2019 Negro\nand promptly made him their go-to Negro designated by them as\n\u201cthe Leader of the Negro people.\u201d Washington\naccommodated them, in service to his own ego as well as in service to\nthe benefit of the Negro race (by his own reasoning, of course). He\nwas brilliantly skillful in executing a nuanced, pragmatic strategy of\nwearing a mask of seeming accommodation to White hegemony as\nhe promoted Negro empowerment and self-sufficiency through education\nthat stressed disciplined comportment, thrift, industrial and\nagricultural work, and ownership of property (and while clandestinely\nsupporting securing political equality for Negroes). As an enlarged\nfigure who brokered the largesse and influence of White people flowing\nto Negroes throughout the nation, and as the founding administrative\nand educational leader of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama that continues\nto provide education to persons of African descent, Booker T.\nWashington\u2019s philosophizings, political engagements, and\npractical endeavors would have widespread, profound, and lasting\nimpact.\n\n\nWashington was challenged, publicly and on several fronts, by, among\nother thinker-activist Black persons, the astute and irrepressible\nthinker-scholar (and more) William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868\u20131963)\nwhose philosophical stances and strategies for transforming the\nconditions of existence for Black people were substantially\ndifferent from Washington\u2019s seeming public accommodation\nto White social hegemony. In the view of some, Washington might be\nbetter described as a social separatist and economic and political\nconservative committed to Black economic independence made even\nstronger by the predominance of Negroes in some sectors of the national\neconomy resulting in the dependence of White folks on the productivity\nof Black folks. To this end, for Washington and similar conservative\naccommodationists, the economic and political hegemony of White people\nwas to be finessed by strategies of seeming acceptance by\nBlack people that masked surreptitious opposition as Colored people\npursued economic self-reliance, full political citizenship, and\neventual social acceptance that was to be \u201cearned\u201d by\nforming and exercising good character and responsibility through\neducation for, and the practice of, honest, socially productive, and\neconomically rewarding work.\n\n\nDu Bois, however, argued for immediate recognition of and\nrespect for Negro people with full civil and political rights (though\nhe supported qualifications for exercising the franchise for\nall voters), social equality, and economic justice. He became\nan outspoken critic of Washington\u2019s leadership (\u201cOf Mr.\nBooker T. Washington and Others,\u201d 1903) having become impatient\nwith the latter\u2019s accommodating gradualism and the\nspirit-sapping impact he (Du Bois) thought this was having on those\nBlack folks who were ready, even overdue, for full equality and\nrespect (Du Bois 1903; 1992). In contrast to Washington, Du Bois might\nbest be described as a cultural nationalist\nadvocating pluralist integration: pursuit of a racially\nintegrated socially and politically democratic socio-political\norder\u2014and, later in his long life, a democratic socialist\neconomic order\u2014in which diverse racial and ethnic groups\ncultivate and share, and benefit mutually from sharing, the products\nof their cultural distinctiveness to the extent that doing so does not\nthreaten the integration and justness of the social whole.\n\n\nThe two men were from profoundly different backgrounds. Washington had\nbeen born into slavery, but with the aid of education and character\ndevelopment at Hampton Institute he was able to advance to national\nand international prominence as an educator and figure of\nunprecedented influence, which he recounted in his widely read and\ninspiring autobiography Up From Slavery (Washington 1901;\n1963). Du Bois, on the other hand, never had living experience with\nslavery, nor, even, with much in the way of invidious racial\ndiscrimination before entering college in the South. With\nundergraduate degrees from Fisk University and Harvard University,\nstudies at the University of Berlin, and a Ph.D. in History from\nHarvard, Du Bois was one of a very few exceptionally highly educated\npersons in the United States. Drawing on his learning and with\narrogant confidence in his education-enhanced, penetrating, creative,\nand critical intellect, varied, frequent, and penetrating scholarly\nand creative explorations of the history, conditions, and future\nprospects of the Negro and other oppressed races, as well as of\nWestern Civilization, became his passionate and committed life\u2019s\nwork.\n\n\nDu Bois far outstripped Washington in the range of his (Du Bois\u2019s) concerns, the\ndepths of his explorations, and the extent of his seminal involvements\nin and contributions to international organizations and movements\npressing for independence for colonized African and other peoples, his\ncontributions to a number of the international Pan-African Conferences\n(1919, 1921, 1923, 1927, and 1945) and Movement being but one example.\nAnd of particular note, Du Bois studied philosophy with William James\nand others while a student at Harvard, and, for a moment, considered\npursuing a career in the discipline. Though he chose otherwise, his\nvast and rich articulations are frequently philosophically novel and\nastute and thus all the more engaging for researchers, scholars,\nteachers, artists, and millions of readers in various educated publics.\nHis The Souls of Black Folk (1903), for example, has been a\nseminal text for generations of African Americans, and others, who were\ncoming of age intellectually. Many were aided, especially, by his\npoignant characterization and exploration of the vexing tensions of the\nexperience of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d\u2014of the\n\u201ctwoness\u201d of being both Negro and American\u2014and by his\npromising exploration of how best to work at resolving the tension by\n\u2018merging\u2019 the two selves into one \u2018truer\u2019\nself.\n\n\nFrom Du Bois, then, a philosophy of the soul, if you will, motivated\nby the compelling needs of a racialized people subjected to\nontological as well as social, political, economic, and cultural\ndegradation. In particular, during the turbulent decades of the\norchestrated failure of post-Civil War Reconstruction, when real\npossibilities for racial and economic democracy were being killed at\nbirth by the proponents and guardians of capitalism and White Racial\nSupremacy, Du Bois initially worked out his affirmative cultural\nnationalist position on the raciality of the Negro, and of other\nraces, in \u201cThe Conservation of Races\u201d (1897; 1992). This\nwas an effort at conceptionalization to which Du Bois would return and\nrework several times, even near the end of his extraordinarily long\nand productive life, as in \u201cWhither Now and Why\u201d (1960;\n1973). Throughout his life Du Bois remained convinced that people of\nAfrican descent should articulate and appropriate a racial identity\nbased on shared history and culture and continue to invest in their\nhistorical legacies and cultural creativity while holding open to all,\n\u201con the principle of universal brotherhood,\u201d the\norganizations, institutions, and cultural riches in and through which\nthe life-worlds of Negro peoples are forged, sustained, and\nshared.\n\n\nBooker T. Washington died in 1915, W.E.B. Du Bois nearly half a\ncentury later (\u2026on the evening before the historic 1963 March on\nWashington for Jobs and Freedom as hundred of thousands of Negroes and\nother supporters converged on the nation\u2019s capital to press for\nfull civil and economic rights). The deaths of both brought to a close\ntheir long reigns of Black male leadership prominence, and\npredominance, in various arenas. Still, they were far from being the\nonly leaders of their people. For as the nineteenth century gave way to\nthe twentieth, Black women were again substantial contributors to the\nintellectual explorations, organizational work, and local, national,\nand international movements seeking freedom and enhanced existence for\nAfrican and African-descendant peoples. They were, as well, influential\non Black male leadership. In 1897, for example, Du Bois accepted an\ninvitation from Alexander Crummell to become a member of the American\nNegro Academy to share in the critical work of developing\nunderstandings of the deteriorating situation of Black people in the\nnation, made worse by widespread racially-motivated violence, in order\nto develop and implement strategies to protect and advance the race.\n(Du Bois offered his proposal in \u201cThe Conservation of\nRaces,\u201d the second Occasional Paper delivered to the group.) Due\nlargely to Crummell\u2019s objections, Black women were not initially\nallowed to become members of the Academy. However, while Crummell was a\nsubstantial influence on Du Bois, he (Du Bois) was also influenced by\nAna Julia Cooper who advised his thinking on a number of matters\nregarding which he conversed with his male colleagues in the Academy.\nOther women\u2014Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell, Jane\nAdams\u2014also exerted critical influence on Du Bois through their\nideas, their organizational work, and their personal relations with\nhim.\n\n\nThese and other thoughtful, articulate, and engaged Black women did\nnot allow themselves to be limited to subordinate roles of influence on\nmale leaders. Rather, as was true for many of their foresisters, they\nhad important matters of concern about which they thought seriously,\ndiscussed in their women\u2019s clubs and other organizations, wrote\nand spoke, and worked with determination to effect progressive\ntransformations in the lives of women and their families as well as for\nthe racial group and the society as a whole. From the especially\nviolent and trying decades of Reconstruction on into the early decades\nof the twentieth century, women such as Wells-Barnett, Cooper, Terrell,\nand others contributed substantially to what has become a long and\nvaried tradition of woman-focused philosophizing and artistic\nexpression by women of African descent in the United States.\n\n\nContinuing the tradition, Elise Johnson McDougald, for example, wrote\nof \u201cThe Struggle of Negro Women for Sex and Race\nEmancipation\u201d (1924\u201325; 1995); Alice Dunbar-Nelson\n(1875\u20131935) of \u201cThe Negro Woman and the Ballot\u201d\n(1927; 1995); Sadie Tanner Mosell Alexander of \u201cNegro Women in\nOur Economic Life\u201d (1930; 1995); and Florence \u201cFlo\u201d\nKennedy produced \u201cA Comparative Study: Accentuating the\nSimilarities of the Societal Position of Women and Negroes\u201d\n(1946; 1995). Working through, and often leading, local, regional,\nnational, and international secular and church-related women\u2019s\nclubs and organizations, these and other Negro women gave defining\nshape to legacies of feminist and womanist engagement and leadership\nthat are now being reclaimed and studied for inspiration and\nguidance. And the efforts and contributions of several of these women\nwould be joined to those of later generations who would become major\ncontributors, in thought and in other ways, to developments that would\nunfold as history-making movements devoted to cultural expressiveness,\ngaining more in the way of civil and economic rights, to gaining\npower, Black Power!, and to gaining more freedom, rights, and\nrespect for women of all ethno-racial groups and socio-economic\nclasses.\n",
