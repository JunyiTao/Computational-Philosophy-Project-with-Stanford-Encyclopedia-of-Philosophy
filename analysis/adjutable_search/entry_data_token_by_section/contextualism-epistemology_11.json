Among proponents of EC, however, there has been relatively little discussion, and little agreement, about what linguistic model best captures this fact. Thus, Cohen (1988, 97) speaks of \u2018knowledge\u2019 as \u201can indexical\u201d,[19] Hambourger (1987, 262) likens it to \u2018large\u2019, Heller (1999a, 206; 1999b, 121) says that it is a vague term, and DeRose, while at one point (1992, 920\u2013921) using an analogy with the demonstrative \u2018this\u2019, tends to be noncommittal as to the appropriate model for \u2018know\u2019.\nIt has been objected, however, that regardless of which model is adopted, the linguistic data surrounding \u2018know\u2019 and cognate expressions is not what one would expect were the term genuinely context-sensitive. For example, Jason Stanley (2004) argues that, unlike terms like \u2018flat\u2019 and \u2018tall\u2019, \u2018know\u2019 is not clearly gradable. Thus, it makes sense to describe someone as \u201cvery tall\u201d; but while I might say that someone knows something \u201cvery well,\u201d \u2018very\u2019 does not appear here to be functioning as a degree modifier. And while \u2018justified\u2019 is obviously gradable, even if gradability were sufficient for context-sensitivity, from the fact that knowledge requires justification it would not follow that \u2018know\u2019 is context-sensitive as well (pace Cohen 1999, 60). Nor, Stanley argues, does \u2018know\u2019 behave like indexicals (\u2018I\u2019, \u2018here\u2019) or relational terms (such as \u2018enemy\u2019).\nIn a related argument, John Hawthorne points out that with uncontroversially context-dependent terms, we naturally employ \u201cthe clarification technique\u201d. An example from the previous Section illustrates the point: I balk at your claim that Kansas is flat, pointing out that there is a small rise just ahead. Rather than admitting to a mistake (\u2018concession\u2019) or simply repeating your claim (\u2018sticking to one\u2019s guns\u2019), you clarify: \u201cWell, what I meant was that there are very few mountains.\u201d Hawthorne\u2019s point is that we have very few techniques of clarification in the case of \u2018know\u2019; whereas, it \u201cis through the clarification technique that sensitivity to context-dependence is manifested\u201d (2004, 104-106).\nFinally, Herman Capellen and Ernie Lepore (2003) argue that, according to certain tests for genuine context-sensitivity, \u2018know\u2019 just does not pass muster. (In their discussion, examples like the one illustrating the \u201cunpleasant consequence\u201d of EC mentioned in 4.1, above, loom large.)\nResponses on behalf of EC to such arguments vary. Commenting on Stanley, Barbara Partee (2004) agrees that \u2018know\u2019 is indeed unlike expressions such as \u2018tall\u2019, but that perhaps better models are available. Nikola Kompa (2002) suggests that the context-sensitivity of \u2018know\u2019 is best understood as deriving from a sui generis sort of \u201cunspecificity\u201d. And Rob Stainton (2010), while sympathetic to the claim that \u2018know\u2019 is not itself context-sensitive, believes that the \u201cspirit\u201d of EC can be saved: if there are pragmatic determinants of what is stated/asserted, then what is stated (/etc.) in different uses of \u2018knowledge\u2019 sentences can vary in truth-conditional content, even if \u2018know\u2019 is not context-sensitive. (Here, there is a connection between EC and its philosophy-of-language namesake, mentioned in Section 2. On one formulation of the latter, as a quite general matter \u201cwhat is said\u201d is importantly determined by extra-semantic factors. A similar connection is evident in Charles Travis\u2019 2005 paper.)\nCeding less ground, Peter Ludlow argues that questions about gradability are too crude a standard by which to judge whether \u2018know\u2019 is context-sensitive. Ludlow disagrees with Hawthorne about the prevalence of clarificatory devices for \u2018know\u2019 and argues that there is good reason to think its semantics includes placeholder(s) for variable standards. Like DeRose (2005), Ludlow casts EC as a piece of \u2018ordinary language\u2019 philosophy, and in that spirit he presents the results of Google searches in which clauses like, \u201c\u2026by objective standards\u201d, \u201c\u2026with some certainty\u201d, \u201c\u2026doggone well\u2026\u201d, and so on, accompany uses of \u2018know\u2019. The latter are more data to be mulled over in considering possible linguistic bases for EC. In general, from the fact that different standards are employed, even explicitly adverted to, in making some evaluative judgments in different domains, it does not immediately follow that a contextualistic semantics for the relevant terms is correct (Conee 2014, 64). Some standards that we employ in making a statement, for example, are understood to be merely guidelines or rule of thumb, not direct applications of the statement\u2019s truth conditions. Questions about the proper handling of such data as Ludlow cites\u2014e.g., whether the relevant utterances involve the making-explicit of context-variable standards for \u201cknowledge\u201d, or the conveying of information over and above that encoded in the word itself\u2014arise as much here as with the considerations initially used to motivate EC.\n",
