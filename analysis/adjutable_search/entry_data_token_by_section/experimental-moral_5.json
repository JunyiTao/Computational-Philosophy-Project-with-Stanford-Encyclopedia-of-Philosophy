Knobe, for example,\nuses experimental investigations of the determinants of moral\njudgments to identify the contours of philosophically resonant\nconcepts and the mechanisms or processes that underlie moral judgment.\nHe has argued for the pervasive influence of moral considerations\nthroughout folk psychological concepts (2009, 2010; see also Pettit\n& Knobe 2009), claiming, among other things, that the concept of\nan intentional action is sensitive to the foreseeable evaluative\nvalence of the consequences of that action (2003, 2004b,\n 2006).[2]\n\n\nAnother line of research is due to Joshua Greene and his colleagues\n(Greene et al. 2001, 2004, 2008; Greene 2008), who investigate the\nneural bases of consequentialist and deontological moral judgments\n(but see Kahane et al. 2015). Greene and his colleagues elicited the\nintuitions of subjects about a variety of trolley problems\u2014cases\nthat present a dilemma in which a trolley is racing towards five\nindividuals, all of whom will be killed unless the trolley is instead\ndiverted towards one individual\u2014while inside an fMRI scanner.\nThe researchers found that, when given cases in which the trolley is\ndiverted by pulling a switch, most subjects agreed that diverting the\ntrolley away from the five and towards the one person was the right\naction. When, instead, the case involved pushing a person off a bridge\nto land in front of and halt the trolley, subjects were less likely to\njudge that sacrificing the one person as morally permissible. In\naddition, Greene found that subjects who did judge it permissible to\npush the person took longer to arrive at their judgment, suggesting\nthat they had to overcome conflicting intuitions to do so (but see\nMcGuire et al. 2009)\u2014a finding bolstered by the fact that when\nsubjects considered pushing the person off the bridge, their brains\nrevealed increased activity in areas associated with the aggregation\nand modulation of value signals (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal cortex\nand dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Greene concludes that our\naversion to pushing the person is due to an emotional response to the\nthought of causing physical harm to someone, while our willingness to\npull the switch is due to the rational calculation that saving five\npeople is preferable to letting five people die to spare one life.\nGreene and Singer use these findings as a basis for a debunking of\ndeontological intuitions and a vindication of consequentialism, since\nthe latter rests on intuitions which stem from a source we consider\nboth generally reliable and appropriately used as the basis for moral\nreasoning. It should be noted, though, that this argument presupposes\nthat emotional reactions are (at least in these cases) necessarily\nirrational or arational; philosophers who are unsympathetic to such a\nview of emotions need not follow Greene and Singer to their ultimate\nconclusions (Berker 2009; Greene 2014; Railton 2014).\n\nA related approach aims to identify the features to which intuitions\nabout philosophically important concepts are sensitive. Sripada (2011)\nthinks that the proper role of experimental investigations of moral\nintuitions is not to identify the mechanisms underlying moral\nintuitions. Such knowledge, it is claimed, contributes little of\nrelevance to philosophical theorizing. It is rather to investigate, on\na case by case basis, the features to which people are responding when\nthey have such intuitions. On this view, people (philosophers\nincluded) can readily identify whether they have a given intuition,\nbut not why they have it. An example from the debate over determinism\nand free will: manipulation cases have been thought to undermine\ncompatibilist intuitions\u2014intuition supporting the notion that\ndeterminism is compatible with \u201cthe sort of free will required\nfor moral responsibility\u201d (Pereboom 2001). In such cases, an\nunwitting victim is described as having been surreptitiously\nmanipulated into having and reflectively endorsing a motivation to\nperform some action. Critics of compatibilism say that such cases\nsatisfy compatibilist criteria for moral responsibility, and yet,\nintuitively, the actors are not morally responsible (Pereboom 2001).\nSripada (2011) makes a strong case, however, through both mediation\nanalysis and structural equation modeling, that to the extent that\npeople feel the manipulee not to be morally responsible, they do so\nbecause they judge him in fact not to satisfy the compatibilist\n criteria.[3]\n Thus, by determining which aspects of the case philosophical\nintuitions are responding to, it might be possible to resolve\notherwise intractable questions.\n",
