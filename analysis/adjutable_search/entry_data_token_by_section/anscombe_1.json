    "main_text": "Moral and Political Philosophy\n2. Moral and Political Philosophy\n\nAnscombe\u2019s philosophical work does not form a system. But\nunderstanding her thoughts in moral and political philosophy helps one\ngrasp some of her wider philosophical motivations, especially those on\nthe topics of action and intention. We will first discuss several of\nher most well-known papers in moral and political philosophy, for this\nwill shed light on her interest in these other areas.\n\nIn her infamous pamphlet \u201cMr. Truman\u2019s Degree\u201d (MTD)\n(1958), Anscombe protested Oxford\u2019s decision to award Harry\nTruman an honorary doctorate. Some of the ideas in this pamphlet were\nlater developed in \u201cWar and Murder\u201d (WAM) (1972), written\nfor a Christian venue.\n\nShe opposed Oxford\u2019s decision to honor Truman on the grounds\nthat Truman was a murderer. He was a murderer, because \u201cchoosing\nto kill the innocent as a means to your ends is always murder\u201d\n(MTD, 66). The people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were by and large\nnoncombatants, neither fighting the Allies nor supplying Japan with\nthe means of fighting them. She argued that killing these innocent\npeople seemed necessary only because the Allies stupidly insisted that\nJapan unconditionally surrender.\n\nOne defense of Truman that she mentions and briefly opposes goes like\nthis: Truman didn\u2019t really kill anybody; he merely\nsigned a piece of paper. Another goes like this: if killing innocent\npeople were really murderous, then it would be murderous to kill enemy\nsoldiers while they are sleeping, for at that moment they aren\u2019t\nharming anyone (MTD, 67). Both of these moves rest on an implicit view\nof what action (e.g. killing, harming) is. Opposing this view of\naction motivated Anscombe\u2019s own later work on action and\nintention, discussed below in Section 4.\n\nIn WAM, Anscombe wrote at greater length about the difference between\nmurdering and other forms of killing. She distinguished choosing to\nkill the innocent as a means to your end, which is always murder, from\nchoosing to do something else which you know as a statistical\ncertainty will kill the innocent. Bombing civilian populations in\norder to provoke surrender is clearly a case of the former. The\nlatter might or might not also be murder \u2013 it depends upon some\ndetails. It\u2019s possible to administer a drug to alleviate the\nhorrid pain of someone in mortal illness, knowing full well that,\nalas, the patient will thereby die sooner, but not thereby murder your\npatient. The patient\u2019s death might not have been your end, nor a\nmeans to any such end. This difference in an action\u2019s\nstructure bears upon whether it constitutes murder. That is,\nwhat makes some forms of killing murder is not our opposition to it,\nnor the fact that it is unjust or wrong. Rather, some forms of killing\nare aptly described as murder, which we then might condemn\nand oppose.\n\nIn WAM, Anscombe also argued that human society is essential to human\ngood, that the state is necessary for such society, and thus the state\nmust have some right to use even deadly violence against those who\nattack it. (She defends some of these claims in greater detail in\nSAS.) But while pacifism is misguided, so too is the view that the\nstate or its officers may do anything to defend itself. Killing is\nsometimes unjust, sometimes not. But warriors and police are often\ntempted to kill even those who are not unjustly attacking it, and, she\nholds, to kill the innocent deliberately is always murder, and,\nmoreover, murder is always unjust.\n\nTo kill someone deliberately, she notes, is to kill someone either for\nits own sake or as a means to some further end. Such killing is\nintentional. By contrast, Anscombe claims that the distinction between\nthe intended and the merely foreseen is \u201cabsolutely\nessential\u201d to Christian ethics. Some actions (e.g. murder)\nChristian ethics always prohibits or forbids, and intentional killing\nof the innocent is on this list.\n\nSome people had instead held that one can direct one\u2019s\nintentions a certain way to achieve the desired result with moral\nimpunity. If, for example, one tells oneself that by doing y\none is really only intending x, then one is off the hook,\neven if y is forbidden.\n\nThe devout Catholic bomber secures by a \u201cdirection of\nintention\u201d that any shedding of innocent blood that occurs is\n\u201caccidental.\u201d I know a Catholic boy who was puzzled at\nbeing told by his schoolmaster that it was an accident that\nthe people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were there to be killed; in fact,\nhowever absurd it seems, such thoughts are common among priests who\nknow that they are forbidden by the divine law to justify the direct\nkilling of the innocent (WAM, 59).\n\n\nThis teaching strikes Anscombe as quite absurd. She chalks this\nmisunderstanding up to \u201cCartesian\u201d psychology, a\nphilosophy of psychology she works to oppose elsewhere.\n\nA philosophical understanding of intention (and thus not just Catholic\ndoctrine) is needed to show that killing innocent people as a\nmeans to ending a war (or whatever) just is intentionally\nkilling the innocent, despite whatever thoughts are running through\nthe mind of the killer at the time. Thus she argues for a proper\nunderstanding of Aquinas\u2019s idea that it matters whether some\naction\u2019s effect is intended or merely foreseen, something we\nmust grasp if we are to see what motivates the Principle or Doctrine\nof Double Effect (See SEP entry for more about the pros and cons of\nthe Doctrine of Double Effect). Anscombe does not so much argue for\nthe principle, as insist that it has not been adequately understood.\nSo to defend the Principle of Double Effect, a principle of ethics, we\nfirst need a sound understanding of the concepts of action and of\nintention. More on this in Section 4.\n\nWe will see the same need to understand the concepts of action and\nintention by studying her most well-known paper, \u201cModern Moral\nPhilosophy\u201d (MMP). There Anscombe presses three theses. First,\ndoing moral philosophy is useless, and will remain so until we have an\nadequate philosophy of psychology, which is a long way away. Second,\nmoral philosophers in any case should abandon the concepts of moral\nobligation, moral duty, and the moral \u201cought\u201d, for these\nconcepts make sense only in several conceptions of ethics none of\nwhich generally survives. Third, there are no important differences\namong the well-known English moral philosophers from Sidgwick onwards.\nEach of Anscombe\u2019s three theses is bold; taken together, they\nare shocking.\n\nWe will start with her last thesis. Anscombe notes that despite their\nmany differences, \u201cevery one of the best known English academic\nmoral philosophers\u201d thinks that killing the innocent is\nsometimes right, such as when the foreseeable consequences of\nnot killing them would be catastrophic. She traces this to\nSidgwick\u2019s definition of intention, according to which one\nintends any and every foreseen consequence of one\u2019s\nvoluntary action. While the moral philosophers she criticizes\ndon\u2019t necessarily accept Sidgwick\u2019s definition of\nintention, they do accept an ethical thesis based upon it: a person is\nalways equally responsible for the intended and the merely\nforeseeable consequences of their voluntary actions. Anscombe\nidentifies this move as the difference between the\nUtilitarianism of John Stuart Mill, who rejected the thought that it\ncould ever be apt to calculate whether to kill an innocent person, and\nthe consequentialism (a term she invented) of later English\nphilosophers. Consequentialism, as she explains, is not directly a\ndoctrine about what makes an action right \u2013 this meaning came\nabout only later in the recent history of philosophy. Instead,\nconsequentialism is about what one is responsible for. But the two\ntopics are connected: if you are equally responsible for intentionally\nkilling innocent people and for merely foreseeably killing innocent\npeople, then why would it be wrong to kill one innocent person to save\nfive? For if you don\u2019t, you\u2019d be just as responsible for\nthe death of the five as if you had killed them yourself. Thus even\nmany deontologists (like W.D. Ross) agree with Sidgwick that in some\ncircumstances you have a moral duty to kill innocent people. (See also\nMTD, 71.) But Anscombe instead held that the consequentialist view of\nresponsibility ultimately rests on a false view of what it is to act\nintentionally.\n\nHere and elsewhere, MMP touched a nerve with the philosophers she\ntargeted. One reason for this was the rather dismissive tone she took\nin some of her criticisms. Another is her rich use of irony. In\naddition to criticizing her contemporaries, she brusquely and perhaps\nuncharitably attacks Butler, Hume, Kant, Bentham, and Mill. One might\nsometimes guess that Anscombe is complaining about her colleagues\nbecause they favor new radical ideas, preferring philosophy that\nleaves everything in its place. But in fact she criticizes them on the\ngrounds that the standards from which they begin are, in practice, the\nones that happen to be current in their own society, and so modern\nmoral philosophers wind up being very conventional. This was also the\nthrust of her BBC radio lecture \u201cDoes Oxford Moral Philosophy\nCorrupt the Youth?\u201d, which she answered in the negative, on the\ngrounds that English culture was already corrupt, and\ncontemporary moral philosophy merely reflected rather than generated\nor opposed this turpitude.\n\nThe second thesis of MMP is that moral philosophers ought to abandon\nthe concepts of moral obligation, moral duty,\nmoral \u201cought\u201d, and the like. (The generic\n\u2018ought\u2019 is fine.) These concepts, Anscombe argues, have a\npoint only in a law-based ethics: if a moral legislator (e.g. God)\ncommands you to do something, then you have a moral obligation or\nmoral duty to do it. But in forms of ethics not based upon such a\nlegislator, talk about moral obligation or moral duty is akin to those\narguing about what is criminal in a society lacking criminal law or\ncourts, or, alternatively, to castaways talking about whether their\nclothing accords with the new company policy \u2013 the necessary\nsocial framework for making such talk meaningful is absent. Unlike J.\nL. Mackie, who thought that moral thought and talk was false, Anscombe\nargued that it was nonsense, which is probably worse. She held that\nethicists would do better to classify actions instead as, say,\ntruthful or untruthful, just or unjust, \u2026 rather than as\nmorally right or morally wrong.\n\nAnscombe\u2019s thought here resembled that of her contemporaries\nPhilippa Foot and Iris Murdoch. All were opposed to Utilitarianism,\nand were suspicious of its emphasis on \u2018thin\u2019 evaluative\nterms. Our moral thought is far richer than that. Of course, their\ncriticism was not restricted to Utilitarianism. Any moral theory\npredominantly employing thin moral concepts such as \u2018morally\nright\u2019 and \u2018morally wrong\u2019 were subject to this\ncritique. Thin moral concepts are opposed to \u2018thick\u2019 ones.\nBernard Williams famously characterized thick concepts this way:\n\nIf a concept of this kind applies, this often provides someone with a\nreason for action \u2026 We may say, summarily, that such concepts\nare \u201caction-guiding.\u201d \u2026 At the same time, their\napplication is guided by the world. A concept of this sort may be\nrightly or wrongly applied, and people who have acquired it can agree\nthat it applies or fails to apply to some new situation \u2026. We\ncan say, then, that the application of these concepts is at the same\ntime world-guided and action-guiding. (Williams, 1985, 140)\n\n\nTo describe an action as \u2018cowardly\u2019 seems to provide much\nmore information than to describe it as \u2018wrong\u2019. Further,\nthin terms can lead us astray. In MMP, after describing the\nUtilitarian commitment to be open, in principle, to \u201c\u2026\njudicially punishing a man for what he is clearly understood not to\nhave done \u2026\u201d, which is clearly \u2018unjust\u2019, she\nwrites:\n\nAnd here we see the superiority of the term \u2018unjust\u2019 over\nthe terms \u2018morally right\u2019 and \u2018morally wrong\u2019.\nFor in the context of English moral philosophy since Sidgwick it\nappears legitimate to discuss whether it might be \u2018morally\nright\u2019 in some circumstances to adopt that procedure; but it\ncannot be argued that the procedure would in any circumstances be\njust. (MMP, 16)\n\n\nNo doubt Anscombe\u2019s claims in MMP inspired some philosophers to\ndevelop modern versions of what\u2019s now known as virtue ethics, a\ntheory designed to be a full-fledged alternative to Kantianism,\nexistentialism, utilitarianism, and other totalizing theories. But it\nis crucially important to notice that Anscombe herself did not\nadvocate this development, and this brings us to the first thesis of\nMMP: it is not profitable for us at present to do moral philosophy\nuntil we have an adequate philosophy of psychology. Even if it would\nbe in some ways \u201cbetter\u201d to theorize about ethics by using\nvirtue concepts such as \u2018truthful\u2019 or \u2018just\u2019,\nrather than using concepts that now have no point, our efforts should\nreally be directed to the philosophy of psychology, and not to moral\nphilosophy at all. Even if we do know that some paths (e.g.\nthose which fixate on moral obligation) take us in the wrong\ndirection, we don\u2019t know which of the many remaining paths to\ntake.\n\nWhat did she have in mind by \u2018philosophy of psychology\u2019?\nIn MMP, she names several topics we would first need better\nconceptions of: \u2018action\u2019, \u2018intention\u2019,\n\u2018pleasure\u2019, \u2018wanting\u2019, and maybe one day\n\u2018virtue\u2019 and \u2018flourishing\u2019. She never\ndeveloped an adequate conception of virtue nor of flourishing, and so\nshe was never in a position even to begin doing moral\nphilosophy. But she did, of course, contribute to the development of\nbetter conceptions of action and intention.\n\nThere is some controversy about whether Anscombe was being sincere in\narguing we should stop doing moral philosophy. Crisp 2004 suspected\nthat she was surreptitiously arguing for the superiority of a\nGod-based moral philosophy over any secular moral philosophy,\neven one like Aristotle\u2019s. He worried that Anscombe\u2019s view\nthat moral philosophers should turn to issues in moral psychology\nreally applies only to those who deny divine law, and that Christians\nlike her can continue to do moral philosophy.\n\nIn a sense, Crisp is right. Anscombe did believe in a divine moral\nlaw, and so must have thought that a theistic moral philosophy would\nhave advantages over any other. And Anscombe, of course, did have\nviews about how to live, had arguments for some of these views, and\nrepeatedly opposed the zeitgeist by, say, protesting the use of atomic\nbombs and of abortion.\n\nBut when Anscombe said we (we secular or at least disunified\nphilosophers) should stop doing moral philosophy until we have an\nadequate philosophy of psychology, she did not mean that we should\nabandon all of our ethical thought and talk. This is for two reasons.\nFirst, one need not think it\u2019s profitable to do moral philosophy\nto have views about how to live or to coherently support or oppose\nvarious actions. Her plea to stop doing moral philosophy does\nnot conflict with her having strong views about what to oppose, just\nas one might have all kinds of views about what is and isn\u2019t\nillegal even if one never does any legal philosophy. Echoing\nRousseau, you don\u2019t need to be a philosopher in order to oppose\n(or support!) injustice.\n\nSecond, she did indeed think that some classes of action (e.g. murder)\nwere \u201cabsolutely excluded\u201d (MTD 71) for what we\nmight call moral reasons. But most of her argumentative writings on\nsuch topics were aimed at audiences who already shared her view that\none did not need the results of moral philosophy in order to live\nwell. In the preface to a posthumous collection of essays, Luke\nGormally explains that the bulk of her addresses in that volume were\ndelivered to Catholic audiences, where she assumed \u201cacceptance\nof authoritative Church teaching\u201d [FHG, x]. If you and your\naudience trust that God has promised each of you that it is in your\ninterest to avoid injustice, you don\u2019t need to deeply understand\nthe concept of flourishing or of virtue in order to talk to one\nanother about how to live. Compare: if you trust your travel agent\nwhen she says that drinking alcohol on what appears to you to be a\nstateless island is in fact illegal, then you don\u2019t need to do\npolitical philosophy in order to talk with your fellow travelers about\nwhether to leave the alcohol at home.\n\nFinally, as Aquinas exemplified, it\u2019s possible to think that\nmorality is based upon God and also believe that we need to understand\nthe nature of our psychology in order to adequately understand\nmorality. Her call to give moral philosophy a rest until we better\nunderstand the philosophy of psychology was addressed to us all, not\njust to a subset of moral philosophers.\n",
