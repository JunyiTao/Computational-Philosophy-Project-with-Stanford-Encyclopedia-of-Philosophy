    "main_text": "Synechism, the Continuum, Infinites, and Infinitesimals\n6. Synechism, the Continuum, Infinites, and Infinitesimals\n\n\nAlong with Richard Dedekind and Georg Cantor, Peirce was \none of the first scientific thinkers to argue in favor of the existence of \nactually infinite collections, and to maintain that the paradoxes that \nBernard Bolzano had associated with the idea of infinite collections were \nnot really contradictions at all. His criterion of the difference between finite \nand infinite collections was that the so-called \u201csyllogism \nof transposed quantity,\u201d which had been introduced \nby Augustus de Morgan, constituted a deductively valid\nargument only when applied to finite sets; as applied to infinite sets\nit was invalid.  The syllogism of transposed quantity runs as\nfollows. We have a binary relation R defined on a set\nS, such that the following two premises are true of the relation \n(where the quantifications are taken over the set\nS). First, for all x there is a y such that\nRxy. Second, for all x, y, z,\nRxz and Ryz implies that x = y. The\nconclusion (of the syllogism of transposed quantity) is that for all\nx there exists a y such that Ryx. One of\nPeirce\u2019s favorite examples helps elucidate the idea, even if it\nperhaps be not perfectly politically correct: Every Texan kills some\nTexan; no Texan is killed by more than one Texan; therefore every\nTexan is killed by some Texan. The argument\u2019s conclusion follows\nvalidly only if the set of Texans is finite.\n\n\nIf by Rxy in the syllogism of transposed quantity we take \nf(x) = y, where the function is defined on\nand has values in the set S, then the second premise of the \nsyllogism of transposed quantity says that f is a one-one function. \nThe conclusion says that every member of S is the image \nunder f of some member \nof S. Thus the syllogism of transposed quantity says that no one-one \nfunction can map the set S to a proper subset of itself. This \nassertion holds, of course, only if S is a finite set. So, as it turns \nout, Peirce\u2019s definition of the difference between finite and infinite sets is \nvirtually equivalent to the standard one, which is found in Section 5 of Richard \nDedekind\u2019s Was Sind und Was Sollen die Zahlen?, to the effect that an \ninfinite set is one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a \nproper subset of itself. Peirce claimed on various occasions to have \nreached his definition of the difference between finite and infinite collections \nat least six years before Dedekind reached his own definition.\n\n\nPeirce held that the continuity of space, time, ideation, feeling, and\nperception is an irreducible deliverance of science, and that an\nadequate conception of such continua is an extremely important part of\nall the sciences. The doctrine of the continuity of nature he called\n\u201csynechism,\u201d a word deriving from the Greek preposition\nthat means \u201c(together) with.\u201d In mid-1892, somewhat under\nthe influence of reading Cantor\u2019s works, Peirce defined a (linear)\ncontinuum to be a linearly-ordered infinite set C such that\n(1) for any two distinct members of\nC there exists a third member of C that is strictly\nbetween these; and (2) every countably infinite subset of C\nthat has an upper (lower) bound in C has a least upper bound\n(greatest lower bound) in C. The first property he called\n\u201cKanticity\u201d and the second \u201cAristotelicity.\u201d\n(Today we would likely call these properties \u201cdensity\u201d and\n\u201cclosedness,\u201d respectively.) The second condition has the\ncorollary that a continuum contains all its limit points, and\nsometimes Peirce used this property in conjunction with\n\u201cKanticity\u201d to define a continuum.\n\n\nToward the end of the nineteenth century, however, Peirce began to\nhold that Kanticity and Aristotelicity, even when conjoined, were\ninsufficient to define adequately the notion of a continuum. He\nmaintained that he had framed an updated conception of continua by\nsomewhat loosening his attachment to Cantor\u2019s ideas. He began to write\nin ways that, at least at first glance, seem close to falling into\nCantor\u2019s Paradox; Peirce, however, tried to avoid outright\ncontradiction by means of embracing some sort of non-standard idea\nabout the identity of points on a line. For example, in Lecture 3 of\nhis Cambridge Conferences Lectures of 1898, published\nas Reasoning and the Logic of Things, Peirce says that if a\nline is cut into two portions, the point at which the cut takes place\nactually becomes two points. What Peirce\u2019s new approach is, in\nmathematical detail, and whether or not it contains hidden but real\ncontradictions, is a problem that has not yet been solved by\nresearchers into Peirce\u2019s logic and mathematics.\n\n\nConnected with his new conception of the continuum is Peirce\u2019s\nincreasingly frequent and sometimes pugnacious defenses of the\ndoctrine of the reality of infinitesimal quantities. The doctrine was\nnot newly taken up by Peirce late in the nineteenth century; indeed,\nhe had held the doctrine for some time, and it had been the doctrine\nof his father Benjamin. He considered it superior to the newer\ndoctrine of limits for providing a foundation for the differential and\nintegral calculus. What was new was that Peirce began to see the\ndoctrine of infinitesimals as the key to his updated doctrine of the\ncontinuum. Thus, adding to his long-standing defense of infinitely\nlarge magnitudes (Peirce often used the word\n\u201cmultitudes.\u201d), Peirce began vigorously to defend\ninfinitely small magnitudes, infinitesimal magnitudes.  Many examples\nof such defenses can be found. Carolyn Eisele collected a number of\nsuch examples in her edited work The New Elements of Mathematics\nby Charles S. Peirce. See, for example, Volume 2, pages\n169\u2013170, where Peirce says \u201cMy personal opinion is that\nthere is positive evidence of the real existence of infinitesimals;\nand that the admission of them would considerably simplify the\nintroduction to the calculus.\u201d See also Volume 3, Part 1, pages\n121\u2013124, 125\u2013127, 128\u2013131, and 742\u2013750. By the\nend of the nineteenth century Peirce\u2019s view about infinitesimals was\nso rare and remarkable that Josiah Royce remarked, in a footnote of\nhis \u201cSupplementary Essay\u201d for The World and the\nIndividual, First Series, that outside of Italy Peirce was\nvirtually the only mathematical philosopher who believed in\ninfinitesimals. (See footnote 2, page 562 of this work by Royce.)\n\n\nNot only did Peirce defend infinitesimals. He furthermore claimed that he\nhad proved the consistency of introducing infinitesimals into the\nsystem of real numbers in such a way as to form a new system in which\nthere were infinitely many entities that were not equal to zero and\nyet were all smaller than any real number r that is not equal\nto zero, no matter how small r might be. To use modern\nterminology, Peirce was claiming to have shown the existence of\nordered fields that were non-Archimedean. It was these non-Archimedean\nfields that Peirce now wanted to call genuine continua.  Additionally,\nPeirce wanted to use his notion infinitesimal quantities and his\nrevised concept of the continuum in order to justify the traditional\npre-Gaussian definitions and underpinnings of the differential\ncalculus.\n\n\nPeirce also made a number of remarks that suggest, in connection with\nthe foregoing enterprise, that he had a novel conception of the\ntopology of points in a continuum. All these remarks he connected with\nhis previous defenses of infinite sets. For these reasons some Peirce\nscholars, and in particular the great Peirce scholar Carolyn Eisele,\nhave suggested that his ideas were an anticipation of Abraham\nRobinson\u2019s non-standard analysis of 1964. Whether this actually be so\nor not, however, is at the present time far from clear. Peirce\ncertainly says many things that are quite suggestive of the\nconstruction of non-standard models of the theory of ordered fields by\nmeans of using equivalence classes of countably infinite Cartesian\nProducts of the standard real numbers and then applying Lo\u015b\u2019s\nTheorem. However, no commentator up to now has provided anything even\nremotely resembling a careful and detailed exposition of Peirce\u2019s\nthinking in this area. Unfortunately, most of Peirce\u2019s published\nwriting and public talks on this topic were designed for audiences\nthat were extremely unsophisticated mathematically (a fact that he\nlamented).  For that reason most of what Peirce said on the topic is\npicturesque and intriguing, but extremely obscure. The entire analysis\nof Peirce\u2019s notion of an infinitesimal, as well as the exact bearing\nthis notion has on his concept of a real continuum and on his idea of\nthe topology of the points of a continuum, still awaits meticulous\nmathematical discussion.\n",
