    "main_text": "Imagination\n3. Imagination\n\nThe use of the word \u201cimaginative\u201d in \u201cimaginative\nresistance\u201d has been criticized for disregarding the fact that\nnot all resistance reactions are related to the imagination and it has\nbeen suggested that perhaps imagination might have nothing to do with\nthe resistance reactions. One of the debates on imaginative resistance\nhas dealt with whether imaginative resistance cases put constraints on\nour cognitive imagination (belief-like imagining) or conative\nimagination (desire-like imagining), or fail to put any constraints on\nthe imagination at all (see sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the entry on\n imagination\n for explanations of the relation between imagination and belief, on\nthe one hand, and the relation between imagination and desire, on the\nother). It is possible to regroup some of the theories of imaginative\nresistance that have been covered in\n Section 2,\n alongside other theories, with respect to this debate. \n\nMiyazono and Liao (2016) take on this task and provide a detailed\ntaxonomy of the positions in the imaginative resistance literature\nwith respect to what psychological components of the human mind they\ntake to be necessary for explaining imaginative resistance. The\ntheories can be divided into three main groups: cognitive imagination\ntheories, conative imagination theories, and no-imagination\ntheories.\n",
