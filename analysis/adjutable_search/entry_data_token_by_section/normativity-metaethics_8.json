    "main_text": "Can Normativity Be Given a Naturalistic Explanation? || Normative Formalism\n3.1 Normative Formalism\n\nThe basic idea of normative formalism can perhaps be conveyed if we\nmention that there at least seem to be truths about what one has most\nreason to do in a game. We pointed this out before, in\ndiscussing reasons fundamentalism. There also seem to be truths about\nwhat one ought to do in a game. In chess, for instance, one\nought to castle early and there is reason to protect one\u2019s\nqueen. One might think, however, that this \u201cought\u201d and\nthis reason have in themselves no genuine authority over a\nperson\u2019s decisions, not even if she is playing chess. Of course,\na person might have a prudential reason to play well, or she might\nhave a moral reason to do so if she promised, but chess reasons in\nthemselves have no authority over her. They are not\n\u201crobustly\u201d normative in the philosophically most\ninteresting and important sense. Chess reasons have no genuine claim\non anyone\u2019s attention in the way that the moral reason to be\nloyal to friends does. Normative formalism rejects this line of\nthought. On the formalist view, the idea of normative authority, and\nthe idea of genuine or robustly normative reasons or\n\u201coughts\u201d, are empty. There is nothing to normativity\nbeyond the fact that certain rules or norms \u201ccall for\u201d\ncertain actions or decisions in certain situations in the way that the\nrules of chess and considerations of strategy in chess call for\ncastling early.\n\nFormalism has been defended by Evan Tiffany (2007; see also Hubin\n2001), and it seems to be implicit in places where it is not\nexplicitly defended. It is compatible with a variety of positions,\nincluding normative realism, as we will explain. Yet formalism is a\nradical view. It seems to imply that, other things being equal, the\nreason to castle early is no different with respect to its authority\nover actions or decisions, and with respect to its normativity, from\nthe reason to be honest and truthful.\n\nFor our purposes, the important point is that formalism offers an\naffirmative answer to the question we are discussing in this section,\nfor it explains normativity on the basis of the logic and content of\nnorms and rules that have currency in relevant social contexts\n(Tiffany 2007; Parfit 2011, II: 308\u2013309). H.L.A. Hart arguably\nhas a similar view about the normativity of law (1994: 257; see Copp\n2019). If normative formalism is correct, then, there is a ready\nanswer to Mackie\u2019s argument from queerness. For, if formalism is\ncorrect, normativity is no more mysterious than facts about the\nrules of games or facts about social norms and social practices.\n\nThe controversial issue, however, is whether there is such a thing as\nthe \u201crobust\u201d or \u201cauthoritative\u201d normativity\nthat formalism rejects. Our question presupposes that there is such a\nthing, for otherwise the organizing question we are asking in this\nsection is neither especially interesting nor challenging. For this\nreason, we set aside the formalist view in what follows.\n",
