    "preamble": "\n\nAmong Immanuel Kant\u2019s (1724\u20131804) most influential\ncontributions to philosophy is his development of the transcendental\nargument. In Kant\u2019s conception, an argument of this kind begins\nwith a compelling premise about our thought, experience, or knowledge,\nand then reasons to a conclusion that is a substantive and unobvious\npresupposition and necessary condition of this premise. The crucial\nsteps in this reasoning are claims to the effect that a subconclusion\nor conclusion is a presupposition and necessary condition of a\npremise. Such a necessary condition might be a logically necessary\ncondition, but often in Kant\u2019s transcendental arguments the\ncondition is necessary in the sense that it is the only possible\nexplanation for the premise, whereupon the necessity might be weaker\nthan logical. Typically, this reasoning is intended to be a\npriori in some sense, either strict (Smit 1999) or more relaxed\n(Philip Kitcher 1981, Pereboom 1990). The conclusion of the argument\nis often directed against skepticism of some sort. For example,\nKant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction targets Humean skepticism about\nthe applicability of a priori metaphysical concepts, and his\nRefutation of Idealism takes aim at skepticism about external objects.\nThese two transcendental arguments are found in the Critique of\nPure Reason (1781, 1787), but such arguments are found throughout\nKant\u2019s writings, for example in the Groundwork of the\nMetaphysics of Morals (1785), in the Critique of Practical\nReason (1788), in the Critique of the Power of Judgment\n(1790), and in the Opus Posthumum (1804; F\u00f6rster 1989).\nThis article focuses on the Transcendental Deduction, the Refutation\nof Idealism, and more recent transcendental arguments that are\ninspired by Kant\u2019s work.\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. The Transcendental Deduction\n\nThe Transcendental Deduction (A84\u2013130, B116\u2013169) is\nKant\u2019s attempt to demonstrate against empiricist psychological\ntheory that certain a priori concepts correctly apply to\nobjects featured in our experience. Dieter Henrich (1989) points out\nthat Kant\u2019s use of \u2018Deduktion\u2019 redeploys\nGerman legal vocabulary; in Holy Roman Empire Law,\n\u2018Deduktion\u2019 signifies an argument intended to\nyield a historical justification for the legitimacy of a property\nclaim. In Kant\u2019s derivative epistemological sense, a deduction\nis an argument that aims to justify the use of a concept, one that\ndemonstrates that the concept correctly applies to objects. For Kant a\nconcept is a priori just in case its source is the\nunderstanding of the subject and not sensory experience (A80/B106;\nStrawson 1966: 86). The specific a priori concepts whose\napplicability to objects of experience Kant aims to vindicate in the\nTranscendental Deduction are given in his Table of Categories\n(A80/B106); they are Unity, Plurality, and Totality (the Categories of\nQuantity); Reality, Negation, and Limitation (the Categories of\nQuality); Inherence and Subsistence, Causality and Dependence, and\nCommunity (the Categories of Relation), and Possibility-Impossibility,\nExistence-Nonexistence, Necessity-Contingency (the Categories of\nModality).\n\nDavid Hume in effect denies that a deduction can be provided for a\nnumber of metaphysical concepts \u2013 ideas, in his\nterminology \u2013 including the ideas of personal identity, of\nidentity over time more generally, of the self as a subject distinct\nfrom its perceptions, and of causal power or force (1739, 1748). In\nHume\u2019s view, a concept can only be validated by finding a\nsensory experience, that is, an impression, in particular the\none that is the \u2018original\u2019 of that idea, which must\nresemble that idea. But because, for example, any attempt to find an\nimpression of causal power turns out to be fruitless, Hume concludes\nthat this idea does not legitimately apply (1748: \u00a77). In\nKant\u2019s terminology, Hume is determining whether one might\nprovide an empirical deduction of the concept of causal power\n(A85/B117), and from the failure of the attempt to do so, he concludes\nthat this concept lacks objective validity, that is, it does\nnot apply to the objects of our experience.\n\nHume\u2019s position on the deducibility of a priori\nmetaphysical concepts is Kant\u2019s quarry in the Transcendental\nDeduction. But Kant concurs with Hume\u2019s proposal that no\nempirical deduction can be supplied for such concepts. Instead, he\nsets out to provide a different sort of justification for their use,\none that is transcendental rather than empirical. Such a\ntranscendental deduction begins with a premise about any possible\nhuman experience, a premise to which reasonable participants in the\ndebate can be expected initially to agree, and then contends that a\npresupposition and necessary condition of the truth of that premise is\nthe applicability of the a priori concepts in question to the\nobjects of experience. Kant\u2019s Transcendental Deduction features\na number of component transcendental arguments. Each begins with a\npremise either about the self-attributability of mental items,\napperception, or else a premise about the necessity and\nuniversality of some feature of our experience of objects. Kant\u2019\nstrategy is to establish a theory of mental processing,\nsynthesis, by arguing that its truth is a necessary condition\nfor the truth of such a premise, and then to show that the a\npriori concepts at issue \u2013 the categories \u2013 have an\nessential role in this sort of mental processing. On a metaphysical\nidealist interpretation of his position, the objects of experience\nresult from this mental processing, and it is due to the role that the\ncategories have in this processing that they correctly apply to\nobjects. In the Transcendental Deduction Kant would thus intend to\nsecure a normative claim, that the categories correctly apply to the\nobjects of our experience, by establishing a psychological theory\n(Henrich 1989; Patricia Kitcher 1990: 2\u201329; for information on\nrelated argumentative strategies in Kant\u2019s historical context,\nsee Kuehn 1997 and Dyck 2011). The Transcendental Deduction presents\ngeneral considerations supporting the applicability of all the\ncategories to the objects of our experience; it does not concentrate\non the applicability of specific categories. This more focused task is\ntaken up in various sections of the Analytic of Principles\n(A130\u2013235/B169\u2013287).\n\nIn the Metaphysical Deduction (A66\u201383, B92\u2013116)\nKant intends to derive the categories from the specific modes or forms\nof any human thought about the world, the logical forms of\njudgment. The Metaphysical Deduction has an essential role to\nplay in the Transcendental Deduction, and we will discuss this\nargument at an appropriate juncture (when we reach \u00a719 of the\nB-Deduction).\n\nFor Kant, the most significant rival theory of mental processing is\nthat of his target, Hume. Hume concurs that a theory of experience\nrequires an account of the processing of mental items, but he denies\nthat such an account demands a priori concepts or issues in\ntheir legitimate applicability to experience. According to his theory,\nassociationism, our mental repertoire consists solely of\nperceptions, all of which are sensory items \u2013 the more vivid\nimpressions, which constitute sensory experience, and their less vivid\ncopies, the ideas, which function in imagination, memory, reasoning,\nand conceptualization (1748, \u00a7\u00a72, 3). Association is the\nprocess by which these perceptions are related and ordered. A\nsignature feature of association on Hume\u2019s view is that it\nrequires no resources distinct from the perceptions themselves. How\nperceptions are ordered is solely a function of what perceptions alone\ncan provide. Significantly, a subject not constituted solely of\nperceptions has no role in Hume\u2019s theory; the Humean subject is\njust a collection of perceptions (1739: I, IV, vi). These last two\nfeatures in particular make Humean associationism a highly economical\ntheory, which provides it with an initial advantage over Kant\u2019s\nmore complex view. However, Kant contends that associationism cannot\naccount for the facts to which the premises of the Transcendental\nDeduction appeal, and that synthesis by a priori concepts,\nthat is, the categories, is required in addition.\n\nKant characterizes synthesis as \u201cthe act of putting different\nrepresentations together, and grasping what is manifold in them in one\ncognition\u201d (A77/B103); it is a process that \u201cgathers the\nelements for cognition, and unites them to form a certain\ncontent\u201d (A78/B103). Synthesis takes multiple representations\n\u2013 in Kant\u2019s terminology, a \u2018manifold\u2019 \u2013\nand connects them with one another to produce a single further\nrepresentation with cognitive content (Patricia Kitcher 1990, 2011).\nThis process employs concepts as modes or ways of ordering\nrepresentations. A claim critical to the Transcendental Deduction is\nthat it is the categories by means of which manifolds of our\nrepresentations are synthesized. Since the understanding of the\nsubject is the source of the categories, and also a faculty that\nyields synthesis, the subject plays a crucial role in mental\nprocessing. It is important for Kant\u2019s view on mental processing\nthat this subject is distinct from its representations, and this is\nanother respect in which it differs from Hume\u2019s theory.\n\nThis discussion will focus on the Transcendental Deduction in the\nsecond edition of the Critique of Pure Reason (1787) \u2013\nthe B-Deduction \u2013 thoroughly rewritten and rethought\nrelative to the A-Deduction of the first edition (1781). On\nmy reading, in \u00a7\u00a716\u201320 of the B-Deduction Kant employs\na two-pronged strategy for defeating associationism and establishing\nsynthesis. The first, contained in \u00a7\u00a715\u201316, is\ndesigned to show that association cannot account for an aspect of\none\u2019s consciousness of one\u2019s self that Kant refers to as\nthe consciousness of its unity, and that synthesis is\nrequired to provide this explanation. This type of argument he calls\nan argument from above, signifying that it begins with a\npremise about self-consciousness. Correlatively, in\n\u00a7\u00a717\u201320 we find an argument from below, by\nwhich Kant intends to establish that synthesis by means of the\ncategories is needed as a necessary condition of how we represent\nobjects (the above/below terminology is derived from A119; for\nrelevant historical background, see Carl 1989, 1992). On several other\nreadings, as we shall see, the B-Deduction is a more unified argument.\nThere are reasons to accept and reasons to resist interpretations of\nthis kind.\n1.1 Apperception and its Unity\n\nThe argument from above in \u00a716 can be divided into two stages.\nThe goal of the first is to establish the various components of\nthe principle of the necessary unity of apperception. The\nsecond stage aims to show that synthesis is a necessary condition for\nthe aforementioned aspect of self-consciousness, which this principle\nhighlights. Apperception is the apprehension of a mental\nstate \u2013 a representation, in Kant\u2019s terminology \u2013 as\none\u2019s own; one might characterize it as the self-ascription or\nself-attribution of a mental state (Strawson 1966: 93\u20134). In\nKant\u2019s conception, my apperception has necessary unity\nsince all of my representations must be grounded \u201cin\npure apperception, that is, in the thoroughgoing identity of\nthe self in all possible representations\u201d (B131\u20132,\nemphasis mine). By this he means that:\n\n(The principle of the necessary unity of apperception) It\nmust be the case that each of my representations is such that I can\nattribute it to my self, a subject which is the same for all of my\nself-attributions, which is distinct from its representations, and\nwhich can be conscious of its representations (A116, B131\u20132,\nB134\u20135).\n\n\nOne might note three aspects of the meaning of this principle. First,\nas pointed out earlier, Kant maintains that the apperceiving subject\nis not itself a collection of representations. Kant affirms that I\nhave no inner intuition of the subject (e.g. B157), and this claim\nwould conflict with the subject\u2019s being a collection of\nrepresentations, since he holds that I can intuit my representations\nby inner sense (e.g. A33/B49). Also, in \u00a716 Kant remarks:\n\u201cthrough the \u2018I\u2019, as simple representation, nothing\nmanifold is given; only in intuition, which is distinct from the\n\u2018I\u2019, can a manifold be given\u201d (B135). If he believed\nthe apperceiving subject to be a collection of representations, it\nwould be surprising for him to deny that anything manifold is given\nthrough my representation of it. Second, my ability to attribute\nrepresentations to myself as subject of them is pure, as\nopposed to empirical apperception. This means that I have\nthis ability not in virtue of Humean inner perception, or Kantian\ninner intuition, but rather independently of any such empirical\nfaculties. However, Kant repeatedly affirms that the purity of this\napperception does not imply that the subject to which one\u2019s\nrepresentations can be attributed is intuited \u2013 represented as\nan object \u2013 in a purely rational or a priori way (e.g.,\nB406\u20139). Third, Kant states that pure apperception is\noriginal, and the explication he provides is that \u201cit\nis that self-consciousness which, while generating the representation\n\u2018I think\u2019 \u2026 cannot itself be accompanied by any\nfurther representation\u201d (B132). I cannot have an intuition or\nany other type of representation of myself as apperceiving subject\nother than by way of \u2018I think\u2026\u2019-type thoughts, and\nhence these thoughts are the original representations of this subject\n(e.g., A350). At the same time, by virtue of my capacity for\napperception, I can have a kind of propositional grasp of the\napperceiving subject; Kant affirms that in apperception, I am\nconscious that I exist as subject (B157). (For recent\nextensive discussions of Kant on self-knowledge, see Rosefeldt 2000,\nKitcher 2011, and Longuenesse 2017; cf. Howell 2001.)\n\nKant initiates the first stage of the argument in \u00a716 by\nclaiming:\n\nIt must be possible for the \u2018I think\u2019 to accompany all my\nrepresentations; for otherwise something would be represented in me\nwhich could not be thought at all, and that is equivalent to saying\nthat the representation would be impossible, or at least would be\nnothing to me. (B131\u201332)\n\n\nOn one interpretation, the sense in which a representation would be\nimpossible or nothing to me if it could not accompanied with the\n\u2018I think\u2019 is simply that I could not then become conscious\nof it (Guyer 1987: 139\u201344). It is credible that for any\nrepresentation of which I am conscious, I can attribute it to myself\nas subject, assuming my mental faculties are in working order, and if\nno controversial account of the nature of the subject is presupposed.\nHowever, the claim that I can become conscious of each of my\nrepresentations, and that it is therefore possible for me attribute\neach of them to myself as their subject, is likely false. Plausibly,\nsome of my representations are so thoroughly subconscious that I\ncannot attribute them to myself, while they are nevertheless mine due\nto the causal relations they bear to other representations and to\nactions that are paradigmatically mine. Fortunately, however, the\npremise that each of my representations is such that I can attribute\nit to myself is not crucial for the argument from above. Rather, the\npremise Kant ultimately singles out is less committed, and focuses\nmore specifically on the identity or sameness of the subject of\ndifferent self-attributions, and my being conscious of this\nidentity.\n\nA number of interpreters, including Robert Howell (1992) and James van\nCleve (1999), maintain that the argument of \u00a716 requires a\npremise affirming the possibility of my being simultaneously\nconscious of the multiple elements of my representations, and that the\nimplausibility of this premise jeopardizes the soundness of the\nargument. Howell\u2019s specific objection is that Kant does not\nestablish the following crucial premise:\n\n(S) All of the elements of the manifold of i (where\ni is some arbitrary intuition) are such that H is or can\nbecome conscious, in thought, that all of those elements, taken\ntogether, are accompanied by the I think.\n\n\n(S) asserts that all of the individual elements of the selected\nintuition are such that the subject is or can become conscious of them\nsimultaneously. In Howell\u2019s interpretation, only if the elements\nof an intuition together and at the same time are accompanied by the\nsame I think will it be plausible that the subject must\nsynthesize these elements (Howell 1992: 162). On van Cleve\u2019s\nreading, it is required that for any intuition that I have, I actually\nbecome simultaneously conscious of its elements. If this\nco-consciousness were just merely possible, Kant could only conclude\nis that the resulting representation is only possibly subject to the\ncategories (van Cleve 1999: 84). On an interpretation of this type,\nthe mechanism of the argument of \u00a716 is to adduce a kind of unity\nor combination that my representations actually exhibit, and then to\nargue that this unity requires synthesis by means of the categories as\na condition or for its explanation. Kant is thus read as contending\nthat actual co-consciousness is a type of unity that demands synthesis\nby means of the categories, and that any variety of unity short of\nco-consciousness will be inadequate to establishing this objective of\nthe Deduction.\n\nHowell points out that (S) contrasts with a weaker claim:\n\n(W) Each element of the manifold of i is such that H is or\ncan become conscious, in thought, that the I think\naccompanies that element. (Howell 1992: 161)\n\n\nwhich allows that the individual elements of the intuition are such\nthat the subject can only become conscious of each separately, perhaps\nin turn. He contends, however, that the unity expressed by (W) is\ninsufficient to generate this need for synthesis. If I am merely\n(possibly or actually) serially conscious of the elements of an\nintuition, it won\u2019t be required that I synthesize them into a\nunified intuition. Howell goes on to argue that while (W) is credible,\nKant cannot in fact establish (S); it is implausible that such\nco-consciousness for any arbitrary intuition is actual or even\ngenuinely possible for us. Consequently, the soundness of this\nargument, and the overall argument of the B-Deduction is\nimperiled.\n\nHowever, it may be that only the weaker premise (W) is required for\nthe success of the argument of \u00a716. First, although the\nco-consciousness premise (S) might be suggested in \u00a716\nby the following text:\n\nThat relation comes about, not simply through my accompanying each\nrepresentation with consciousness, but only in so far as I conjoin one\nrepresentation with another, and am conscious of the synthesis of\nthem. (B133)\n\n\nthat claim is not uncontroversially made here. For by the assertion\nthat I \u201cam conscious of the synthesis of them,\u201d i.e., of\nthese representations, Kant may mean only that I am conscious that\nthey stand in a certain intimate relation to one another, for\ninstance, that that they are integrated with each other in a way\ndistinct from how mine are integrated with yours, which does not\nrequire co-consciousness (Pereboom 1995).\n\nMoreover, it might well be that the argument of \u00a716 features a\nsubtlety that obviates the need for actual co-consciousness. The text\nindicates that the argument crucially turns on the claim that only\na priori synthesis \u2013 that is, synthesis by a\npriori concepts \u2013 can explain how I might represent the\nidentity of my apperceptive consciousness (B133) or how I\nmight represent the identity of the apperceiving subject (B135)\nfor different elements of the manifold of intuition to which I can\nattach the I think. The inadequacy Kant claims for\n\u201cempirical consciousness,\u201d that is, for consciousness\naccording to Humean psychological theory, is that \u201cit is in\nitself dispersed (an sich zerstreut) and without relation to\nthe identity of the subject (und ohne Beziehung auf die\nIdentit\u00e4t des Subjects)\u201d (B133). One implication of\nthis passage is that Hume\u2019s theory does not have the resources\nneeded to explain how I can self-attribute various of my\nrepresentations or their elements to a subject that is both conscious\nof them and the same subject for each act of their self-attribution.\nThis objection does not beg the question in Kant\u2019s dispute with\nHume, since it assumes only a claim that uncommitted and reasonable\nparticipants in this discussion would not want to initially deny, that\nthe conscious subject of these apperceptive self-attributions is the\nsame. Hume\u2019s theory lacks the resources to account for this\nidentity. Hume himself provides no account of apperception, but\npossibilities for a Humean account are that apperceptive consciousness\namounts to perceptions that are intrinsically self-conscious, or else\nconsists in perceptions of perceptions. But intrinsically\nself-conscious perceptions would be distinct from one another, as\nwould perceptions of perceptions; and thus they too would be\n\u201cdispersed\u201d (B133), and share no common element. Hume\nmight propose to explain our sense of the identity of the conscious\nsubject of different self-attributions by the intrinsically\nself-conscious perceptions or the perceptions of perceptions being\ncomponents of a single causally coherent bundle. However, this bundle\nwould not itself be conscious of perceptions. Consciousness of\nperceptions would instead be an intrinsic feature of an individual\nself-conscious perception or a feature of individual perceptions of a\nperception. In Kant\u2019s conception, by contrast, accounting for\nour sense of the identity of the conscious subject of different\nself-attributions requires that this subject be distinct from its\nrepresentations.\n\nThe second stage of the argument of \u00a716 highlights another\nimplication of the claim that \u201cthe empirical consciousness,\nwhich accompanies different representations, is dispersed and without\nrelation to the identity of the subject\u201d (B133): that\nHume\u2019s theory lacks the resources to account for my\nrepresentation-relation to the identity of the subject; that\nis, this view cannot explain how I can \u201crepresent to myself the\nidentity of the consciousness in [i.e. throughout] these\nrepresentations\u201d (B133) (for an opposing view see Dickerson\n2004: 95\u20138). We might imagine several kinds of explanation for\nmy representation of this identity. One candidate is that inner sense\nallows me to represent this identity: the way I represent the sameness\nof the subject is akin to how I commonly represent the identity over\ntime of ordinary objects \u2013 by a cognitive sensitivity to\nsimilarities among the intrinsic properties represented. However, Kant\nand Hume concur that this is not how I might represent the identity of\nthe apperceiving subject, since they agree that by inner sense I\ncannot represent any intrinsic properties of such a subject. A second\nkind of explanation, which Kant endorses, is that I have an indirect\nway of representing this identity. This representation must instead\ndepend on my apprehending a feature of my representations (or elements\nof them) (Allison 1983: 142\u20134; Guyer 1977: 267, 1987:\n133\u201339; Patricia Kitcher 2011: 147). The appropriate feature is\na type of unity or ordering of these states. The idea is that if the\nrepresentations I can attribute to myself possess a unity of the right\nkind, and if I apprehend or am cognitively sensitive to this unity,\nthen I will be able to represent the apperceiving subject of any one\nof them as identical with that of any other.\n\nThus my representation of the identity of the subject comes about\n\u201conly in so far as I conjoin one representation with another,\nand am conscious of the synthesis of them\u201d (B133). This\nconsciousness is profitably interpreted as conscious awareness not of\nthe act or process of synthesis itself, but rather of the unity that\nis its outcome (Strawson 1966: 94\u20136; Dicker 2004: 133\u20134)).\nWhat sort of unity must I consciously recognize among my\nrepresentations that would account for my representation of this\nidentity? Note that it is not plausibly co-consciousness, for I\nrepresent the subject as identical for self-attributed representations\nthat are not co-conscious, so actual co-consciousness could not\nexplain generally how I represent this sort of identity. A credible\nalternative is that the unity consists in certain intimate ways in\nwhich representations in a single subject are typically related.\nArguably, the essential feature of this unity is that a single\nsubject\u2019s representations be inferentially and causally\nintegrated to a high degree, and in this respect they are unified in a\nway in which representations possessed by discrete subjects are not.\nAlternatively, several commentators have argued that the relevant\nunity might be a temporal order among my representations, thereby\nlinking the B-Deduction with the arguments of the Second Analogy and\nthe Refutation of Idealism (Guyer 1977: 267; Dicker 2004:\n137\u201344). A concern about this route is that a cognitive\nsensitivity to the time-ordering of representations does not obviously\nfacilitate our representing them as belonging to a single subject\n(Brueckner 1984: 199\u2013208). By contrast, when mental states fail\nto exhibit inferential and causal integration, as in the case of\nmultiple-personality disorder, we have a tendency to posit multiple\nsubjects, while we do not do so when such integration is present.\n\nIn Kant\u2019s view, the candidates for explaining how this kind of\nunity comes to be, or, less ambitiously, for explaining my ability to\nrecognize this sort of unity, are association and synthesis. At this\npoint he appears to suppose that because Hume\u2019s psychological\ntheory has already been ruled out, synthesis is the only remaining\noption. So for me to represent the identity of the subject of\ndifferent self-attributions, I must generate or at least recognize the\nright sort of unity among these representations, and synthesis must be\ninvoked to account for this unity. Thus Kant contends that this\ncombination \u201cis an affair of the understanding alone, which\nitself is nothing but the faculty of combining a\npriori\u201d (B134\u20135. Since the understanding provides\nconcepts for synthesis, and because for synthesis to be a\npriori is, at least in part, for it to employ a priori\nconcepts, Kant is contending here that synthesis by means of a\npriori concepts is required to account for the unity in\nquestion.\n\nHere is an austere representation of the structure of the argument so\nfar:\n\nI am conscious of the identity of myself as the subject of\ndifferent self-attributions of mental states. (premise)\nI am not directly conscious of the identity of this subject of\ndifferent self-attributions of mental states. (premise)\nIf (1) and (2) are true, then this consciousness of identity is\naccounted for indirectly by my consciousness of a particular kind of\nunity of my mental states. (premise)\nThis consciousness of identity is accounted for indirectly by my\nconsciousness of a particular kind of unity of my mental states. (1,\n2, 3)\nIf (4) is true, then my mental states indeed have this particular\nkind of unity. (premise)\nThis particular kind of unity of my mental states cannot be\naccounted for by association. (5, premise)\nIf (6) is true, then this particular kind of unity of my mental\nstates is accounted for by synthesis by a priori concepts.\n(premise)\nThis particular kind of unity of my mental states is accounted for\nby synthesis by a priori concepts. (6, 7)\n\n\nPremise (1) is intended as a claim the skeptic about the legitimate\napplicability of a priori concepts will at least initially\naccept. The crucial necessary conditions, expressed by (3) and (7),\nare necessary conditions of only possible explanation. However, Paul\nGuyer forcefully argues that establishing the need for synthesis by\nmeans of a priori concepts would require ruling out the\nalternative explanation that empirical information and concepts\nderived from it is sufficient to account for the recognition of the\nunity at issue (Guyer 1987:146\u20137). And in his view it remains\nopen, given what Kant has shown, that this recognition requires only\nawareness of information derived from inner sense or introspective\nexperience. Kant does not attempt at this point in the argument to\nrule out such a rival empiricist hypothesis, but he arguably would\nneed to do so to establish the need for a priori synthesis.\nTo advance his claims, one might appeal to features of this unity that\nwould render such an empiricist account inadequate. As we shall see,\nKant employs this tactic in the next phase of the argument, which\nintroduces his account of our representations of objects.\n1.2 Representations of Objects and the Single-Substantive-Premise Interpretation of the B-Deduction\n\nAccording to one widespread reading of the B-Deduction,\n\u00a7\u00a715\u201320 comprise a an argument whose only assumption\nis the premise about self-consciousness that Kant defends in \u00a716.\nStrawson, for example, is a proponent of such an interpretation\n(1966), as are Robert Paul Wolff (1963), Jonathan Bennett (1966),\nHenry Allison (1983), Edwin McCann (1985), and Dennis Schulting\n(2012a). Demonstrating that we represent objects or an objective world\nhas a key role in most versions of this reading. On Strawson\u2019s\ninterpretation, for instance, \u201cthe fact that my experience is of\na unified objective world is a necessary consequence of the fact that\nonly under this condition could I be conscious of my diverse\nexperiences as one and all my own\u201d (1966: 94). Some interpreters\ndissent; Karl Ameriks, for example, contends that Strawson\u2019s\nconception of the Deduction is motivated by a desire to see it as\nshowing that the skeptic about the external world is mistaken, while\nin fact refuting this sort of skeptic is not one of Kant\u2019s aims\nfor this argument (Ameriks 1978; also Allais 2011, 2015). Patricia\nKitcher (2011: 115\u201318) argues against the single premise about\nself-consciousness interpretation on historical and textual\ngrounds.\n\nAn uncontroversial role of \u00a717 is to provide a characterization\nof an object, or more to the point, of a representation of an object,\nthat facilitates a challenge to Humean associationism. Kant\u2019s\nproposal is that an object is \u201cthat in the concept of which a\nmanifold of a given intuition is united\u201d (B137). Here\n\u2018object\u2019 should be read in the broad sense of\nobjective feature of reality \u2013 a feature whose\nexistence and nature is independent of how it is perceived (B 142;\nBird 1962/1973 130\u201331; Strawson 1966: 98\u2013104; Guyer 1987:\n11\u201324). Allison is a proponent of the view that \u00a717 contain\nnot only this challenge to Hume, but also an attempt to demonstrate\nthat we represent objects on the basis of the conclusions about\nself-consciousness established in \u00a716. This interpretation is a\ncomponent of Allison\u2019s broader vision of the B-Deduction,\naccording to which Kant demonstrates that the unity of apperception\nentails that we represent objects, and, conversely, that our\nrepresenting objects entails the necessary unity of apperception\n(Allison 1983: 144ff; 2015: 352\u201355; 2015: 335\u201355, esp. 352)\nIndeed, the crucial claim for Allison\u2019s interpretation is that\nthe unity of apperception is not only a necessary but also sufficient\ncondition for our representing of objects. This he calls the\nreciprocity thesis. Other commentators, including Richard\nAquila (1989: 159), Howell (1992: 227\u20138) and Schulting (2012a)\nagree that the B-Deduction features the reciprocity thesis and an\nattempt to establish its truth, while Ameriks (1978) disagrees. On an\naccount of the sort Ameriks favors, the unity of apperception, and\nmore exactly, the synthesis that explains our consciousness of the\nidentity of the subject, is only a necessary condition for the\nrepresentation of objects (cf. Allais 2011).\n\nAllison\u2019s interpretation is attractive particularly because it\npromises leverage against the skeptic who denies that we represent\nobjects, and also because this leverage is generated by premises about\nself-consciousness that this skeptic is likely to accept.\nNevertheless, there are textual and charitable reasons to resist this\nreading (Ameriks 1978, Pereboom 1995; Patricia Kitcher 2011:\n115\u201360; Vinci 2014: 193\u201394). First of all, in\n\u00a7\u00a718\u201320 Kant makes significant assumptions about\nfeatures of our representations of objects that exceed anything that\nhe has argued for in \u00a717 or earlier. In particular, \u00a718 he\nassumes that our representations of objects manifest a certain kind of\nnecessity and universality, and this he does not purport to establish\nin \u00a717 or earlier. Moreover, in the summary of the preceding\nsteps of the B-Deduction in \u00a720 Kant does not include premises\nfrom \u00a7\u00a715\u201316. What we actually encounter in \u00a720\nindicates that Kant intends \u00a7\u00a717\u201320, with some help\nfrom \u00a713, to constitute a single, self-contained argument that\ndoes not depend on the conclusions about self-consciousness developed\nin \u00a7\u00a715\u201316.\n\nOn Allison\u2019s conception, the argument from the unity of\napperception (or, equivalently, from the unity of consciousness) for\nour representing objects occurs in the following passage:\n\n(A) Understanding is, to use general terms, the faculty of cognitions\n(Erkenntnisse). They consist (bestehen) in the\ndeterminate relation of given representations to an object: and an\nobject is that in the concept of which the manifold of a given\nintuition is united. Now all unification of representations demands\nunity of consciousness in the synthesis of them. Consequently it is\nthe unity of consciousness that alone constitutes the relation of\nrepresentations to an object, and therefore their objective validity\nand the fact that they are cognitions (Erkenntnisse): and\nupon it therefore rests the very possibility of the understanding.\n(B137)\n\n\nAllison himself presents a problem for his interpretation of this\npassage. He contends, first of all, that the reciprocity thesis is\nencapsulated in this sentence:\n\nIt is the unity of consciousness that alone constitutes\n[ausmacht] the relation of representations to an object, and\ntherefore their objective validity.\n\n\nand that Kant presents (1) as a direct consequence of the premise\nthat\n\nall unification of representations demands unity of consciousness\nin the synthesis of them.\n\n\nAllison points out that on this reading Kant\u2019s reasoning appears\nto involve a non sequitur, since (2) supports only\nKant\u2019s having in mind that the unity of consciousness is a\nnecessary condition for the representation of an object, and not for\nits also being a sufficient condition. Howell raises a similar\nconcern: \u201cIn \u00a717 Kant simply does not make this inference\nclear, and an air of blatant fallacy hovers over this part of his\nreasoning\u201d (Howell 1992: 228; for an opposing view see Keller\n1998: 80). But Ameriks argues that the B-Deduction should not be\ninterpreted as providing an argument for the sufficiency claim, and a\nrespectable case can be made for his reading (Ameriks 1978; Pereboom\n1995; Patricia Kitcher 2011: 115\u201360).\n\nAllison and Howell both argue that (1) should be read as a statement\nof the sufficiency claim. Now in (A) Kant contends that cognitions of\nobjects consist in a determinate relation of representations to\nobjects, and as (1) indicates, this relation is constituted or\nproduced by a synthesis that essentially involves the unity of\nconsciousness. However, (1) does not indicate that the synthesis that\ninvolves unity of consciousness cannot occur without its resulting in\na relation of a representation to an object. By analogy, the smelting\nand molding of steel are processes that constitute or produce steel\ngirders, but from this one should not conclude that the processes of\nsmelting and molding steel cannot take place without the production of\nsteel girders. Just as producing steel girders also requires molds of\nparticular shapes, so producing representations of objects might\nrequire, in addition to the synthesis that involves the unity of\nconsciousness, particular concepts of objects.\n\nIf the sufficiency claim, and with it the reciprocity thesis, is\ndenied, we need an alternative account of how \u00a717 functions in\nthe overall argument of the B-Deduction. It may be that the role of\nthis section is largely to provide a characterization of an object\nthat has a key role in the ensuing challenge to Humean associationism,\nand thereby initiates an argument from below. Kant\u2019s proposal is\nthat an object is \u201cthat in the concept of which a manifold of a\ngiven intuition is united\u201d (B137). The subsequent claim is that\nthe unification of a manifold requires synthesis; immediately\nfollowing the characterization of an object he states that \u201call\nunification of representations demands unity of consciousness in the\nsynthesis of them\u201d (B137). It seems consistent with these texts\nthat Kant\u2019s characterization of an object is designed just to\npresent his anti-Humean theory of the mental processing required for\nrepresenting objects, and that the subsequent claim for the need for\nsynthesis does not express a view he expects us to accept without\nfurther argument, but rather one he aims to confirm in\n\u00a7\u00a718\u201320. If this argument succeeds, it will turn out\nthat the a priori synthesis required to account for the\nfeatures of our representations of objects Kant singles out is the\nsame process that yields my consciousness of the identity of myself as\nsubject of different self-attributions.\n1.3 Universality and Necessity in our Experience of Objects\n\nIn \u00a718 Kant draws our attention to certain features of our\nrepresentations of objects that, in his view, will serve to defeat\nassociationism and establish a priori synthesis:\n\nThe transcendental unity of apperception is that unity through which\nall the manifold given in an intuition is united in a concept of the\nobject. It is therefore entitled objective, and must be distinguished\nfrom the subjective unity of consciousness\u2026 Whether I can\nbecome empirically conscious of the manifold as simultaneous\nor as successive depends on circumstances and empirical conditions.\nTherefore, the empirical unity of consciousness, through association\nof representations, itself concerns an appearance, and is wholly\ncontingent\u2026 Only the original unity is objectively valid: the\nempirical unity of apperception,\u2026 which\u2026 is merely\nderived from the former under given conditions in concreto,\nhas only subjective validity. One person connects the representation\nof a certain word with one thing, the other [person] with another\nthing; the unity of consciousness in that which is empirical is not,\nas regards what is given, necessarily and universally valid.\n(B139\u201340)\n\n\nFor Kant, a defining feature of our representations of objects is\ntheir objective validity. For a representation to be objectively valid\nit must be a representation of an objective feature of reality, that\nis, a feature whose existence and nature is independent of how it is\nperceived (Guyer 1987:11\u201324). In this argument, it appears that\nKant just assumes that the representations that make up experience are\nobjectively valid. He then aims to establish that association is\ninadequate because it can yield only representations that are not\nobjectively valid. In the above passage, Kant contends that our\nobjectively valid representations must in a sense be necessary and\nuniversal. However, the empirical unity of consciousness, which\ninvolves an ordering of representations achieved by association, can\nonly be non-universal, contingent, and hence merely subjectively\nvalid, by contrast with the transcendental unity of apperception,\nwhich involves an ordering that is universal and necessary, and is\ntherefore objectively valid. In Kant\u2019s conception, it is the\nfact that the transcendental unity of apperception is generated by\na priori synthesis that allows it to yield an ordering that\nis universal, necessary, and objectively valid. (Ameriks 1978,\nPereboom 1995, Patricia Kitcher 2011: 115\u201360; Allais 2011, 2015;\nVinci 2014). On Lucy Allais\u2019s proposal, empirically we are\nacquainted with objects, but absent a priori synthesis, empirical\nrepresentations would be of objects that are indeterminate with\nrespect to multiple possible ways of conceptualizing and individuating\nthem. Only with a priori synthesis is the representation of\ndeterminate objects possible. The concept of cause has a key role\nhere, since determinacy is paradigmatically a function of represented\ncausal unity of objects (Allais 2015: 275\u201385; cf. Beck 1978;\nVinci 2014: 134\u201344). This determinacy, by virtue of a shared\nscheme of a priori concepts, yields the universality and necessity\nKant has in mind.\n\nTo illustrate and support these claims, Kant invokes examples of the\nordering of phenomena in time that also have the key role in the\ndiscussion of the Second Analogy (cf. Guyer 1987: 87\u201390; Dicker\n2004: 137\u201344). There Kant argues that our representations,\nconsidered independently of their content, are always successive. For\nexample, when I view the front, sides, and back of the house when\nwalking around it, and when I watch a boat float downstream, my\nrepresentations of the individual parts and states occur successively.\nThe content of these successive representations, however, can be\nrepresented as either determinately and objectively successive or as\ndeterminately and objectively simultaneous. And as it in fact turns\nout, despite the representations in each of these sequences being\nsubjectively successive, we represent the parts of the house as\nobjectively simultaneous, and the positions of the boat as objectively\nsuccessive. How might we account for this difference in objectivity\ndespite the similarity in subjectivity? (Melnick 1973: 89)\n\nThe important clue for answering this question is that these\nrepresentations of objective simultaneity and succession are universal\nand necessary. It is the universality and necessity of our\nrepresenting the parts of the house as simultaneous that accounts for\nour representing them as objectively simultaneous, and the\nuniversality and necessity of our representing the positions of the\nboat as successive that accounts for our representing them as\nobjectively successive. Association is inadequate for accounting for\nthis objectivity because it is incapable of yielding such universality\nand necessity, a defect not shared by synthesis.\n\nA first approximation of the import of \u2018universal\u2019 in the\nhouse example is:\n\n(U) Any human experience of the parts of the house is an experience of\nthese parts as objectively simultaneous.\n\n\nThe addition of necessity has the following effect on (U):\n\n(U-N, first pass) Necessarily, any human experience of the parts of\nthe house is an experience of these parts as objectively simultaneous.\n\n\nThis claim would be resisted by Hume if the necessity were specified\nas ranging over all possible circumstances, for Hume\u2019s theory\nwould allow for the possibility of a deviant ordering in unusual\nempirical conditions. But (U-N, first pass) can be reformulated more\nprecisely as\n\n(U-N) Necessarily, if empirical conditions are normal, any human\nexperience of the parts of the house is an experience of these parts\nas objectively simultaneous.\n\n\nKant\u2019s view is that given only the resources of association, the\ntruth of (U-N) cannot be explained. The reason is \u201cwhether I can\nbecome empirically conscious of the manifold as simultaneous or as\nsuccessive depends on circumstances or empirical conditions,\u201d\nand so \u201cthe empirical unity of consciousness, through\nassociation of representations, itself concerns an appearance, and is\nwholly contingent\u201d (B139\u201340). Association cannot explain\nthe truth of (U-N), for given only the resources of association, the\nparts of the house will not necessarily or universally be represented\nas objectively simultaneous even supposing only normal empirical\nconditions. Kant asks us to consider an activity, word association,\nwhich functions as a paradigm for association. Word association,\nfamiliarly, does not yield universal and necessary patterns;\n\u201cone person connects the representation of a certain word with\none thing, the other [person] with another thing\u2026\u201d\n(B140). Hume\u2019s own paradigm for association in is the relations\namong parts of a conversation (1748: \u00a73). In such conversations,\npeople make different associations in the same circumstances.\nKant\u2019s point is that if the very paradigms for association fail\nto exhibit the sort of necessity and universality at issue, then the\nhypothesis that association is powerful enough to yield such an\nordering of representations \u2013 wherever we find it \u2013 is\nruled out. (Pereboom 1995; Dickerson 2004: 170\u201377; for an\naccount of a more general relationship in Kant between universality\nand necessity on the one hand and apriority on the other, see Smit\n2009).\n\nHere we should see Kant as advancing his claim for the applicability\nof the categories by ruling out association as an explanation for\n(U-N). The structure of this (part of the) argument can be represented\nas follows:\n\nWe have representations of objects, i.e., of objectively valid\nphenomena. (premise)\nAll of our representations of objects are (in part) of universal\nand necessary features of experience. (9, premise)\nNecessary and universal features of experience cannot be explained\nby association. (premise, from reflection on the nature of\nassociation))\nIf (10) and (11) are true, all of our representations of objects\nrequire a faculty for ordering mental states distinct from\nassociation. (premise)\nAll of our representations of objects require a faculty for\nordering mental states distinct from association. (11, 12)\nIf (13) is true, all of our representations of objects require a\nfaculty for synthesis by a priori concepts. (premise)\nAll of our representations of objects require a faculty for\nsynthesis by a priori concepts. (13, 14)\n\n\nWe can expand (15) to explicitly note the link to the argument from\nabove:\n\n\n\n15*.\nAll of our representations of objects require a faculty for\nsynthesis by a priori concepts, the same faculty required to\naccount for my consciousness of the identity of myself as subject of\ndifferent self-attributions of mental states. (1\u20138, 13, 14)\n \n\n\nTo this we can add the final moves, which are explained in the\nsubsequent sections of the B-Deduction:\n\nInsofar as our representations of objects require a faculty for\nsynthesis by a priori concepts, certain a priori\nconcepts \u2013 the categories \u2013 legitimately apply to these\nobjects. (premise)\n\n\nWe have representations of objects, and they are all such that the\ncategories legitimately apply to these objects. (9, 15, 16)\n\n\nThe key necessary conditions, expressed by (12) and (14), like those\nof the argument from above, are necessary conditions of only possible\nexplanation.\n\nGuyer objects that at various places in the Transcendental Deduction\nKant illegitimately assumes knowledge of necessity, and perhaps this\nargument falls to such a concern (Guyer 1987: 146\u20137). While this\nconcern has the potential of weakening Kant\u2019s argument, perhaps\nHume would not deny the necessity under consideration at this point in\nthe argument. Hume does maintain that it is in some sense impossible,\ngiven an experience of constant conjunction, that the mind not be\ncarried from an impression of the first conjunct to an idea of the\nnext:\n\n\u2026 having found, in many instances, that any two kinds of\nobjects, flame and heat, snow and cold, have always been conjoined\ntogether; if flame or snow be presented anew to the senses, the mind\nis carried by custom to expect heat or cold, and to believe,\nthat such a quality does exist, and will discover itself upon a nearer\napproach. This belief is the necessary result of placing the mind in\nsuch circumstances. It is an operation of the soul, when we are so\nsituated, as unavoidable as to feel the passion of love, when we\nreceive benefits; or hatred, when we meet with injuries. (1748:\n\u00a75)\n\n\nThus Hume himself contends that given certain specific empirical\ncircumstances, a particular type of ordering of perceptions in a sense\nnecessarily comes about.\n\nA further concern of Guyer\u2019s is that Kant assumes without\ndefense that all knowledge of necessity is grounded in a\npriori concepts. But, in response, perhaps we need not interpret\nKant as arguing directly from (U-N) to the claim that the categories\ncorrectly apply to objects in our experience. Rather, we might see him\nas advancing his claim for the applicability of the categories by\nruling out association as an explanation for (U-N). This transition\ncan be divided into three steps:\n\nTo explain the truth of (U-N), we must have a mental faculty other\nthan association for ordering representations.\nThis faculty does not consist solely of sensory items.\nThis faculty must employ a priori concepts, the\ncategories in particular.\n\n\nThe challenge Kant issues is to explain why, under normal conditions,\nthe ordering in question is universal and necessary. Part of the best\nexplanation, he believes, is (a), that we must have a faculty for\nordering the representations. Hume might agree with this conclusion,\nsupposing a sufficiently thin conception of \u2018faculty\u2019. Yet\nhe would deny (b), that this faculty does not consist solely of\nsensory items. Kant argues that the Humean proposal for a faculty that\nconsists solely of sensory items, the faculty of association, cannot\naccount for the truth of propositions such as (U-N), for the very\nparadigms of association, such as word association, and the\nassociation of topics in a conversation, do not exhibit the requisite\nuniversality and necessity. The alternative that can account for the\ntruth of propositions such as (U-N) involves affirming (c), that the\nfaculty in question must be one that employs the categories.\n\nThe associationist might counter that sensory experience is\nsufficiently uniform for association to produce the universalities and\nnecessities at issue. Perhaps Kant is too quick to conclude that the\nargument from universality and necessity is decisive, for in addition,\nassociationist objections of this sort must be answered \u2013 as\ncontemporary critical discussions of proposals for innate concepts\nindicate (Pereboom 1995: 31\u20133). But this does not detract from\nthe anti-associationist force provided by the sorts of universalities\nand necessities Kant has in mind, and this fact is recognized by the\ncontemporary discussion.\n1.4 Logical Forms of Judgment and the Categories\n\nIn \u00a7\u00a719\u201320, Kant contends that the vehicle that brings\nabout the synthesis at issue is judgment, and that this vehicle\nemploys certain forms of judgment, which are in turn intimately\nrelated to the twelve categories. By connecting synthesis to judgment\nin this way, and the forms of judgment to the categories, Kant aims to\nshow that we must employ the categories in the synthesis of our\nexperience of objects.\n\nIn \u00a719, Kant argues that there must be a certain way in which\neach of my representations is unified in the subject, and he\nidentifies this way with judgment: \u201cI find that a judgment is\nnothing but the manner in which given cognitions are brought to the\nobjective unity of apperception\u201d (B141). Judgment, Kant\nproposes, is objectively rather than subjectively valid, and hence\nexhibits the type of universality and necessity that characterizes\nobjective validity (B142). He then claims that without synthesis and\njudgment as its vehicle, an ordering of representations might reflect\nwhat appears to be the case, but it would not explain how we make\ndistinctions between objective valid phenomena (i.e., objects) and the\nsubjective states they induce (e.g, Allison 2015: 363\u201369; Sethi\n2020).\n\nIn \u00a720, Kant ties this notion of judgment to the twelve forms of\njudgment presented in the Metaphysical Deduction (A70/B95), and he\nthen connects these forms of judgment to the twelve categories\n(A76\u201383/B102\u20139). The claim has often been made that the\nlinks Kant specifies between synthesis and judgment, judgment and the\nforms of judgment, the forms of judgment and the categories are not\nsufficiently supported. Guyer, for example, argues that Kant has not\nadequately established the last of these connections, that although\nKant claims that the categories are simply the forms of judgment as\nthey are employed in the synthesis of representations in an intuition\n(A79/B104\u2013A80/B105, B143), he has failed to make this claim\nplausible (Guyer 1987: 94\u2013102). It is fair to say that these\nconcerns have merit. Kant\u2019s assertions about these ties remain\nmore obscure than the preceding part of the Transcendental Deduction,\nand it continues to be a serious challenge for interpreters to clarify\nand vindicate them.\n\nB\u00e9atrice Longuenesse (1998), in her interpretation of the\nMetaphysical Deduction, takes up this challenge. In her view, the\nfaculty at issue in the production and use of concepts, the\nunderstanding, is the power to judge (Verm\u00f6gen zu\nUrteilen), which is ultimately a disposition or a\nconatus to make judgments and to shape how we are affected so\nthat we can make them (Longuenesse 1998: 208, 394). The logical forms\nof judgment are in essence the forms of combination of concepts in\njudgments. One such form is the categorical, which is the form of\nsubject-predicate judgments; another is the hypothetical, the form of\nconditional judgments. Kant contends that the logical form of a\njudgment is what makes it capable of truth or falsity, for by means of\nsuch a form a judgment can constitute a relation of a subject\u2019s\nrepresentations to an objective feature of reality (Longuenesse 2000,\n93\u20134). For instance, by its categorical form, the judgment\n\u2018the boat is moving\u2019 can constitute the relation of my\nrepresentations of a boat and of motion to an objectively existing\nboat in motion, and as a result this judgment can be true or\nfalse.\n\nOne role of the logical forms of judgment is in the process of\nanalysis, by which the objects we intuit are subsumed under concepts.\nWhat results from this process is a judgment that expresses what Kant\ncalls an analytic unity \u2013 paradigmatically, the unity\nin the subsumption of several intuited objects under a single concept.\nBut a logical form of judgment can also function in a different role:\nin the synthesis of a manifold of an intuition. The result in this\ncase is a synthetic unity, the unity of a synthesized\nmultiplicity of representations in a single intuition. The\nunderstanding, as the power to judge, functions in each of these two\nroles; \u201cthe same function that gives unity to concepts in\njudgment, also gives unity to the mere synthesis of representations in\nintuition\u201d (A79/B104\u20135). In its synthetic role, the\nunderstanding adds content to the forms of judgment:\n\nThe same understanding, and indeed by means of the very same actions\nthrough which it brings the logical form of judgment into concepts by\nmeans of the analytical unity, also brings a transcendental content\ninto its representations by means of the synthetic unity of the\nmanifold in intuition in general. (A79/B105)\n\n\nThe addition of such transcendental content turns the form of judgment\ninto a category. This content is a feature of the forms of intuition,\nspace and time, which are called upon when the power to judge sets out\nto unify a manifold of intuition (B128\u20139). The categories\n\u2013 more precisely, the versions of the categories that are\nschematized for our way of cognizing (A137/B176ff) \u2013 are thus\ngenerated from the forms of judgment in the process of synthesizing\nintuitions by the addition of spatial and temporal content. For\nexample, generated from the categorical form of judgment by the\naddition of such content is the category of substance, and generated\nfrom the hypothetical form of judgment in this way is the category of\ncause. (For beings possessing the power of understanding but with\ndifferent forms of intuition, the categories would be schematized\ndifferently from ours.)\n1.5 The Second Step of the B-Deduction\n\nIn \u00a720 Kant, draws a conclusion from the considerations he has so\nfar advanced: \u201cConsequently, the manifold in a given intuition\nis necessarily subject to the categories\u201d (B143). One might\nthink that this is precisely what Kant intended to establish in the\nTranscendental Deduction, and thus that the argument is brought to an\nend in \u00a720. However, in \u00a721 he indicates that the\nTranscendental Deduction is not yet complete: \u201cThus in the above\nproposition a beginning is made of a deduction of the pure concepts of\nunderstanding\u201d (B144). Kant goes on to explain:\n\nIn what follows (cf. \u00a726) it will be shown, from the mode in\nwhich the empirical intuition is given in sensibility, that its unity\nis no other than that which the category (according to \u00a720)\nprescribes to the manifold of a given intuition in general. Only thus,\nby demonstration of the a priori validity of the categories\nin respect of all objects of our senses, will the purpose of the\ndeduction by fully attained. (B144\u20135)\n\n\nHere a perennial interpretive question arises: how should we construe\nthe argument we find in \u00a726, together with material from\n\u00a724, which is sometimes designated as the second step of the\nB-Deduction?\n\nOne position on this interpretive issue is advanced by Erich Adickes\n(1889: 139\u20134) and H. G. Paton (1936, v. 1: 501), who argue that\nwhile the material that precedes \u00a721 constitutes an\nobjective deduction, material in \u00a724 and \u00a726\ncomprise a subjective deduction. This distinction has its\nsource in the Preface to the A edition:\n\nThis enquiry, which is somewhat deeply grounded, has two sides. The\none refers to the objects of pure understanding, and is intended to\nexpound and render intelligible the objective validity of its a\npriori concepts. It is therefore essential to my purposes. The\nother seeks to investigate the pure understanding itself, its\npossibility and the cognitive faculties upon which it rests: and so\ndeals with it in its subjective aspect. Although this latter\nexposition is of great importance for my chief purpose, it does not\nform an essential part of it. (Axvi\u2013xvii)\n\n\nHenrich (1968\u201369) rejects the Adickes/Paton proposal for the\nreason that in \u00a721 Kant states that the demonstration of the\nvalidity of the categories is completed only in \u00a726, and the\npassage from the A-Preface indicates that this is a task for the\nobjective deduction. In defense of Adickes and Paton, in \u00a720 Kant\nclaims to have established that the categories apply to the manifold\nin any one given intuition, and affirms that he will now show that\ncategories apply to any object presented to the senses. In view of the\naim of the objective deduction, this move would seem to require only a\nstraightforward and trivial application of the result of \u00a720 to\nany empirical intuition we might have (as many commentators have\nnoted). So, on a charitable interpretation of Kant\u2019s agenda,\nshowing that the categories apply to any object presented to the\nsenses plausibly involves considerations beyond the scope of the\nobjective deduction.\n\nHenrich points out that although in the B-Deduction Kant sought to\navoid the problems of a subjective deduction, this \u201cdoes not\nmean that he neglected the demand for an explanation of the\npossibility of relating the categories to intuitions.\u201d However,\nby Kant\u2019s account, a subjective deduction features not only an\nexamination of cognitive faculties, but also an investigation of\n\u201cthe possibility of the pure understanding,\u201d which would\ninclude an investigation of how the categories are related to a priori\nand to empirical intuition and to the objects presented to us in such\nintuition. This is precisely the type of inquiry that we encounter in\n\u00a724 and \u00a726 \u2013 and Henrich agrees. Thus it seems that\nthe views of Henrich, Paton, and Adickes can be reconciled: they\nconcur that the second step aims to show how it is that the categories\nare related to objects of intuition and thus of experience in such a\nway as to demonstrate that they correctly apply to them.\n\nAnil Gomes (2010) proposes a more precise hypothesis for what is\nmissing in the first step that is addressed by the second step. Gomes\nfirst appeals to a problem James van Cleve (1999) raises for the\nTranscendental Deduction. Even if Kant succeeds in showing that\nsynthesis involves judging, and that judging involves the application\nof the categories.\n\nthis would not be enough for his purposes. For that result in\nconjunction with the rest of the Transcendental Deduction would yield\nno conclusion stronger than this: all my representations are connected\nin judgements that use Kant\u2019s categories. But Kant wants to show\nthat the categories are objectively valid \u2013 that they actually\napply to objects of experience. (van Cleve 1999: 89)\n\n\nKant hasn\u2019t established, according to van Cleve, that the\ncategories actually apply to experience. As Gomes (2010: 121) puts it,\n\u201cperhaps our application of the categories in experience is\nalways mistaken, and there is nothing which corresponds to the way in\nwhich we have synthesized the manifold.\u201d As he points out, the\nsecond step reaches its conclusion through the analysis of the\nstructure of our representation of space and time, from which Kant\nthen draws the conclusion that space and time themselves feature that\nstructure (Gomes 2010: 130; he cites a similar claim by Longuenesse\n1998, 213). If space and time do feature the structure of our\nrepresentations of them, then the requisite correspondence is in\nplace, and van Cleve\u2019s objection is answered.\n\nThis is a contending and plausible hypothesis for a role for the\nsecond step in the B-Deduction. One might ask, however, whether the\naccount Kant provides can respond convincingly to van Cleve\u2019s\nobjection. Even on certain idealist views, such as Leibniz\u2019s and\nKant\u2019s according to Robert Adams (1983, 1994: 217\u201361, cf. Wilson\n1987), our ordinary sensible representations of space, and of physical\nentities more generally, may not represent them as they really are. By\ncontrast, on Berkeley\u2019s idealist position as represented in the\nthird of the Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous\n(Berkeley 1713/1998), the properties of physical entities match our\nsensible representations of them exactly, without a possibility of a\nmismatch; the oar in the water really is bent when I see it as bent.\nOn the type of idealism Kant endorses (and one might of course\nquestion whether it has been established), the possibility of a\nmismatch remains in place even if our representation of space\nstructures space itself (Pereboom 1988; Stang 2018; Jauernig 2021).\nFor instance, we may sensibly represent space as Euclidean while is in\nfact Riemannian. One might respond that the representation that\nstructures space would then also be Riemannian, and we would have a\nmatch. But then a crucial feature of our representation of space would\nbe inaccessible absent serious empirical investigation, and the nature\nof the project would be altered.\n\nThe core text that divides interpretations of the second step is the\nnote to B160\u20131:\n\nSpace, represented as object (as is really required in geometry),\ncontains more than the mere form of intuition, namely the\ncomprehension of the manifold given in accordance with the form of\nsensibility in an intuitive representation, so that the form of\nintuition merely gives the manifold, but the formal intuition gives\nthe unity of the representation. In the Aesthetic I ascribed this\nunity merely to sensibility, only in order to note that it precedes\nall concepts, though to be sure it presupposes a synthesis, which does\nnot belong to the senses but through which all concepts of space and\ntime first become possible. For since through it (as the understanding\ndetermines the sensibility) space or time are first given as\nintuitions, the unity of this a priori intuition belongs to space and\ntime, and not to the concepts of the understanding (\u00a724).\n\n\nIt\u2019s widely agreed that a crucial feature of the second step is\nthe claim that our intuitions of space and time are constituted in\nsuch a way as to necessitate the unification of the manifold of\nappearance by the application of the categories. In the Transcendental\nAesthetic, Kant aimed to show that space and time are forms of our\nsensible intuition, and that for us appearances can only occur in\naccord with these forms. But now, in the note to B160\u20131, Kant draws\nour attention to the fact that space and time are not only forms of\nintuition, but are intuitions themselves, and that they are intuitions\nthat feature unity. What\u2019s more, Kant specifies that this unity\n\u2018precedes all concepts, though to be sure it presupposes a\nsynthesis, which does not belong to the senses but through which all\nconcepts of space and time first become possible.\u2019 By the\nsynthesis that is presupposed \u2018the understanding determines the\nsensibility.\u2019 So the unity of space and time is to be explained\nwith reference to the effect of the understanding upon sensibility\nitself (Longuenesse 1998: 211\u201333; Keller 1998: 88\u201394;\nDickerson 2004: 196\u2013201; Pollok 2008; Vinci 2014: 197\u2013229;\nOnof and Schulting 2015; Allison 2015: 374\u2013432; Rosefeldt 2022).\n\nThe text, and in particular the B160\u20131 note, gives rise to a number of\ninterpretive issues for Kant\u2019s overall position. One is whether\nhere Kant countenances a kind of unity in our representations that is\nnot a result of categorical synthesis, but is instead is independent\nof the categories. Hermann Cohen (1871/1987, 1907) and Eric Dufour\n(2003) are strict categorical conceptualists about any such unity,\nwhile Martin Heidegger (1929/1997) argues that there is a unity that\nis accounted for by the productive imagination independently of the\ncategories; (Lorne Falkenstein 1995, Michel Fichant 1997, Robert Hanna\n2008, 2011, Stephanie Gr\u00fcne 2011, Dennis Schulting 2012b, James\nMessina 2014, Colin McLear 2015, and Jessica Wilson 2018 also defend\nnonconceptualist positions on this score; see McLear 2014, 2020 for\noverviews). Longuenesse (1998) contends that unity-yielding synthesis\nis always a function of the understanding, but that there is a kind of\nsynthesis of the understanding that does not involve the categories,\nwhile it yet anticipates them. Messina (2014), McLear (2015), Onof and\nSchulting (2015), and Wilson (2018) argue that there are multiple\nkinds of unity for Kant, and while some require categorical synthesis,\nothers do not. In particular, they maintain that space as intuited by\nus has a unity that Onof and Schulting (2015) call unicity, which\nconsists of its singularity, its infinity, and its mereological\ninversion, i.e., a metaphysical structure involving parts\nontologically depending on the whole, by contrast with the whole\nontologically depending on parts, as is the case for material objects\ngenerally (here see Desmond Hogan 2021). Intuitive awareness of space\nas featuring unicity does not, on their account, require categorical\nsynthesis.\n\nAs Tobias Rosefeldt (2022) points out, a longstanding puzzle for the\nB160\u20131 note is that it references a notion of synthesis that precedes\nall concepts, while the notion of synthesis to which Kant appeals in\nthe preceding sections of the B-Deduction is one that does employ\nconcepts, i.e., the categories, and thus does not precede concepts.\nCommentators generally agree that this synthesis that precedes all\nconcepts must be subject to the unity of apperception (e.g., Messina\n2014, Williams 2018), but how might it be more thoroughly\ncharacterized? Rosefeldt proposes an account of the second step that\nat this point features the notion of a decomposing synthesis, which\ncontrasts with a composing synthesis. Kant, as he points out,\nintroduces the notion of a decomposing synthesis only in the Second\nAntinomy (A505/B533, A524/B552), but in Rosefeldt\u2019s view this\nnotion is aptly suited for Kant\u2019s objectives for the second\nstep. While a compositional synthesis constructs a whole from given\nparts,a decomposing synthesis begins with a given whole and then\ndecomposes it in some way into parts. In this context, it decomposes\nspace as we are intuitively aware of it into one or more of its finite\nparts, such as spheres or cubes, while the remaining infinite spatial\nregion excluded by those parts is represented as their phenomenal\nbackground or horizon (cf., Husserl 1913, 1939). \n\nA test for this proposal is how a decomposing synthesis might\nrepresent space given that we conceptualize it as infinite. On\nRosefeldt\u2019s account, the decomposition into finite parts may\ninvolve imaginatively drawing line segments that form a square. We can\nsubsequently extend these lines in the imagination, and we are\nconscious that we can freely vary the lines so that \u201chowever\nlarge the finite space that we construct by drawing lines is, this\nspace will always only be phenomenally present to us within the\nhorizon of a still larger unlimited space.\u201d This does not amount\nto intuiting space as infinite, but rather coming to understand that\nthe space we intuit is infinite by a progressus ad infinitum\n(A510\u201311/B538\u201339), a progression of a series that we understand is\nnever complete (Onof and Schulting 2015). Accordingly, space itself,\nin this way given as infinite, is an object of intuition for us as the\nphenomenal horizon of finite regions of space from which we\ndistinguish it in the decomposing synthesis. A parallel account holds\nfor time. This account supplies the meaning, Rosefeldt argues, of\nKant\u2019s claim that \u201ca synthesis which does not belong to\nthe senses\u201d is required for \u201cspace and time [to be] first\ngiven to us as intuitions\u201d (B160\u20131n).\n\nAs Rosefeldt notes, the conclusion of the second step, the\napplicability of the categories to space and time, requires appeal to\na composing synthesis, since the decomposing synthesis precedes all\nconcepts, and only in the composing synthesis are the categories\ninvoked. Thus a transition from the decomposing to a composing\nsynthesis must be made. One possible strategy is to claim that a\ncomposing synthesis is not required for our representation of space as\nwhole, but only for our representations of determinate parts of space,\nas when we construct figures in geometry. But while the text of the\nB160\u20131 note does reference geometry, it also suggests (in the final\nsentence) that a composing synthesis is required for our\nrepresentation of space as a whole. Onof and Schulting (2015) argue\nthat it is our explicit representation of the unicity of space as a\nwhole that requires synthesis in accord with the categories, and they\nembellish their account by specifying precisely which categories are\nrequired for the various aspects of unicity (Allison 2015: 420\u201330\nprovides a complementary account). An alternative, suggested by\nRosefeldt (2022), is that first of all, the finite spatial parts that\nwe actually distinguish in decomposing synthesis, either of individual\nspatial parts or of various such parts taken as a group, feature a\nunity, representation of which must be accounted for by compositional\nsynthesis. But further, we are conscious of the fact that the infinite\nspace revealed as the phenomenal horizon in the decomposing synthesis\ncan be subdivided infinitely into finite spatial parts, all of which\nare represented as parts of that one all-encompassing infinite space.\nOur representation of the unity of all of this, which Rosefeldt calls\nworld-unity, must also be accounted for by a composing synthesis. From\nthis we can see that given that a composing synthesis accounts for the\nrepresented unity of the actual finite spaces we distinguish, it can\naccount for the represented world-unity as well. (For a discussion on\nhow a composing synthesis can operate on a target that is\nindeterminate in the way that world-unity is, see Daniel Sutherland\n2021, ch. 5, referenced in Rosefeldt 2022: 16 n.5).\n\nSince it has already been shown that composing syntheses generally\nmust feature the categories, the claim is that we can infer that the\ncategories structure our representation of space, and by parallel\nargument, our representation of time, and, moreover (in accord with\nKant\u2019s idealism), that they structure space and time themselves,\ntogether with the spatial and temporal features of objects in space\nand time. This allows us to see that the categories correctly apply to\nobjects in space and time, and to see that they do so from how they\nstructure our representations of space and time, and space and time\nthemselves. This would secure the generally agreed-upon objective of\nthe second step: to show how it is that the categories are related to\nobjects of intuition and thus of experience in such a way as to\ndemonstrate that they correctly apply to them.\n2. The Refutation of Idealism\n\nIn the transcendental argument of the Refutation of Idealism,\nKant\u2019s target is not Humean skepticism about the applicability\nof a priori concepts, but rather Cartesian skepticism about\nthe external world. This argument was added by Kant to the second\nedition of the Critique of Pure Reason (B274\u2013279, with\na change suggested in the Preface to B, Bxxxix\u2013Bxli), and\nsubsequently embellished and reworked in a series of Reflections\n(Guyer 1987: 279\u2013316). More specifically, Kant intends to refute\nwhat he calls problematic idealism, according to which the existence\nof objects outside us in space is \u201cdoubtful and\nindemonstrable\u201d (B274). His strategy is to derive the claim that\nsuch objects exist from my awareness that my representations have a\nspecific temporal order. At the present time I am aware of the\nspecific temporal order of many of my past experiences, an awareness\nproduced by memory. But what is it about what I remember that allows\nme to determine the temporal order of my experiences? There must be\nsomething by reference to which I can correlate the remembered\nexperiences that allows me to determine their temporal order. But\nfirst, I have no conscious states that can play this role. Further,\nthis reference cannot be time itself, for \u201ctime by itself is not\nperceived;\u201d Kant argues for this claim in the First Analogy\n(B224\u20135). As Guyer puts it, it is not as if the content of\nmemories of individual events are manifestly indexed to specific\ntimes, as sportscasts and videotapes often are (Guyer 1987: 244). Kant\ncontends that the only other candidate for this reference is something\noutside of me in space, and it must be something (relatively)\npermanent (cf. First Analogy, B224\u20135). Perhaps this claim is\nmade plausible by how we often actually determine the times at which\nour experiences occur. We use observations of sun\u2019s positions,\nor of a clock that indicates time by way of the period of a pendulum,\nor by the period of the vibration of a cesium atom. Kant\u2019s\nargument can be seen as exploiting this fact, together with the\nobservation that there is no similar periodic process in human\nconscious experience considered independently of any spatial objects\nit might represent, and that we lack any awareness of time by itself,\nto show we must perceive objects outside us in space by reference to\nwhich we can determine the temporal order of our past experiences.\n\nGeorge Dicker provides a compelling initial representation of\nKant\u2019s argument (Dicker 2004, 2008):\n\nI am conscious of my own existence in time; that is, I am aware,\nand can be aware, that I have experiences that occur in a specific\ntemporal order. (premise)\nI can be aware of having experiences that occur in a specific\ntemporal order only if I perceive something permanent by reference to\nwhich I can determine their temporal order. (premise)\nNo conscious state of my own can serve as the permanent entity by\nreference to which I can determine the temporal order of my\nexperiences. (premise)\nTime itself cannot serve as this permanent entity by reference to\nwhich I can determine the temporal order of my experiences.\n(premise)\nIf (2), (3), and (4), are true, then I can be aware of having\nexperiences that occur in a specific temporal order only if I perceive\npersisting objects in space outside me by reference to which I can\ndetermine the temporal order of my experiences. (premise)\nTherefore, I perceive persisting objects in space outside me by\nreference to which I can determine the temporal order of my\nexperiences. (1\u20135)\n\n\nSeveral points of interpretation should be noted. First, it is\ngenerally agreed that the notion of awareness in Premise (1) should be\ninterpreted as a success notion, i.e., that to be aware that I have\nexperiences that occur in a specific temporal order is to correctly\ndetermine that they occur in this order (Allison 1983: 290ff, Guyer\n1987: 293ff, Dicker 2004, 195ff., 2008; Chignell 2010). Second, most\ncommentators concur that the experiences at issue are my past\nexperiences. Guyer suggests that the argument might be extended to\ncombinations of my past and my present experience, but Dicker objects\nthat the fact that past experiences occurred before the present one is\ndirectly knowable by introspection, and so doesn\u2019t require the\nexternal reference (Guyer 1987; Dicker 2004: 195ff.). Third, Jonathan\nBennett points out that we have single memories whose content spans an\nappreciable length of time that allow us to determine the order of\npast mental states . When one remembers hearing a certain word, one\ncan accurately determine by the content of a single memory that\ncertain phoneme-experiences occurred prior to other\nphoneme-experiences \u2013 for example, that one heard\n\u2018mad\u2019 and not \u2018dam\u2019 (Bennett 1966:\n228\u20139). Dicker (2004: 201\u20132) remarks that we may be able\nto determine accurately the order some of our past states by means of\nsuch memories, but we cannot ascertain the order of most of our past\nexperiences in this way. He therefore advocates a restriction of the\nargument to the experiences we can correctly order but not in the way\nBennett adduces. Fourth, many commentators have noted that we might\nhave perceived time directly. Guyer, as we just saw, suggests that all\nof our conscious experiences might have featured a time clock, much\nlike a television sportscast or a video camera (1987: 244; cf.\nStrawson 1966). But as Dicker points out, in actual fact our\nexperience does not have any such feature, and he is content for\nPremise (4), that time itself cannot serve as the reference whereby I\ncorrectly determine the temporal order of my past experiences, to\nstate a merely contingent fact about us (2004, 2008). Chignell (2010)\nexpresses a concern about interpretations of the Refutation in which\nit is merely a contingent fact about us that the alternative methods\nfor determining the temporal order of my past experiences are\nunavailable, for then the conclusion, that we perceive objects in\nspace, would inherit such mere contingency, which he argues to be at\nodds with Kant\u2019s hopes for the Refutation. Fifth, commentators\ndiffer on the relation that must obtain between the objects in space\nand the experiences whose temporal order we can correctly determine.\nGuyer argues that the relation must be causal, since \u201cthe states\nof the self are judged to have a unique order just insofar as they are\njudged to be caused\u2026 by the successive states of enduring\nobjects\u201d (Guyer 1987: 309; cf. Dicker 2004: 200, 2008). By\ncontrast, in Allison\u2019s view we require the temporal order of\nobjects in space only as a backdrop against which to determine the\ntemporal order of our experiences; \u201can enduring, perceivable\nobject (or objects) is required to provide a frame of reference by\nmeans of which the succession, coexistence, and duration of\nappearances in a common time can be determined\u201d (Allison 1983:\n201). If the object in space that provides the reference is the sun,\nfor example, the states of the sun don\u2019t need to cause my\nexperiences for me to determine their temporal order by means of those\nstates.\n\nThree of the most pressing problems that have been raised for the\nRefutation are the following. First, a skeptic might well reject\nPremise (1) on the ground of a general skepticism about memory\n(Allison 1983: 306\u20137). Bertrand Russell, for example, suggests\nthat for all I know I was born five minutes ago (Russell 1912). On\nthis skeptical hypothesis, I would be mistaken in my belief that I had\nexperiences A, B, and C which occurred more than five minutes ago,\nfirst A, then B, and lastly C. Plausibly, a skeptic who claimed that\nwe lack adequate justification for a belief that external objects\nexist would likely also be disposed to claim that I lack justification\nfor my belief that I had experiences that occurred in the past in that\nspecific temporal order. Thus Kant\u2019s supposition that Premise\n(1) yields leverage against an external-world skeptic is mistaken (cf.\nDicker 2008, Chignell 2010).\n\nSecond, consider the claim that my mental states (or the mental\nsubject itself) are as suited as objects in space to function as a\nreference whereby I can correctly judge the temporal order of my past\nexperiences. Suppose I had available as such a reference only the mere\nmental appearance of a digital clock in one corner of my field of\nconsciousness. This would not clearly be less effective than an actual\nclock in space. To this one might reply, with Dicker, that there are\nno actual mental states that are adequate to serve as such a\nreference. However, and this is the deeper worry, on Berkeley\u2019s\nidealist view according to which the esse (to be) of objects\nin space is their percipi (to be perceived), any spatial\nobjects would be nothing more than mental states of some subject, or\naspects of those states, but Berkeleyan spatial perceptions would be\nas adequate a reference by which to determine the temporal order of my\npast experiences as perceptions of spatial objects that are in some\nsense distinct from my mental states (cf. Allison 1983: 300\u20131;\nVogel 1993; Chignell 2010).\n\nThird, one might contend that Kant\u2019s Refutation demonstrates\nthat the reference in question must be (relatively) permanent, and\nthat there is nothing in the Berkeleyan spatial realm that satisfies\nthis requirement. However, to this one might respond that the\nreference by which I determine the temporal order of my past\nexperiences need not be permanent in a way that cannot be satisfied by\nBerkeleyan spatial objects. If in the corner of my field of\nconsciousness featured distinct momentary flashes, every second,\nindicating the date and time to the second, I would be able to\ndetermine the temporal order of my past experiences by their means\n(cf., van Cleve, reported in Dicker 2004: 207).\n\nA note on the second of these concerns: Several commentators have\nargued that Kant\u2019s Refutation of Idealism is meant to undermine\nany metaphysical sort of idealism, including metaphysical idealisms\nthat have been attributed to Kant (Guyer 1987: 317\u201329). But\nwhile this reading has interesting support, one should hesitate to\nendorse it solely on the ground that Kant maintains that spatial\nobjects are distinct from the states of the perceiver. On a plausible\nmetaphysical interpretation of Kant\u2019s idealism, the\nesse of objects in space is not their percipi, since\nKant\u2019s spatial objects, by contrast with Berkeley\u2019s, are\nrecognition-transcendent. In Berkeley\u2019s position, a\nsubject\u2019s perception of an oar in the water as crooked is not a\nmisperception, for \u201cwhat he immediately perceives by sight is\nnot in error, and so far he is in the right,\u201d and it is\nmisleading only because it is apt to give rise to mistaken inferences\n(Berkeley 1713: Third Dialogue); while for Kant this perception is in\nerror. In Kant\u2019s view, the oar is recognition-transcendent by\nvirtue of the Second Postulate\u2019s provision that the actuality of\nsuch objects is determined causally:\n\nThat which is bound up with the material conditions of experience,\nthat is, with sensation, is actual (wirklich). (A218=B266)\n\n\nThe actual is that which conforms to the system of empirical causal\nlaws (A225/B272ff.), and because the crookedness of the oar does not\nso conform, it is not actual. How the Second Postulate rules out the\nexistence of the apparent spatial objects of dreams and hallucinations\nis spelled out in the third note to the Refutation of Idealism:\n\nNote 3. From the fact that the existence of outer things is required\nfor the possibility of a determinate consciousness of the self, it\ndoes not follow that every intuitive representation of outer things\ninvolves the existence of those things, for their representation can\nvery well be the product merely of the imagination (as in dreams and\ndelusions). Such representation is merely the product of previous\nouter perceptions, which, as has been shown, are possible only through\nthe reality of outer objects\u2026 Whether this or that supposed\nexperience be not purely imaginary, must be ascertained from its\nspecial determinations, and through its congruence with the criteria\nof all actual experience (wirklichen Erfahrung).\n(B278\u20139 cf.A376, cf. A492=B520\u20131)\n\n\nThe objects of dreams and hallucinations don\u2019t meet the\ncriterion of actuality of the Second Postulate, that is, according\nwith the laws of causality. Thus while in Berkeley\u2019s view the\nesse of spatial things consists in their being perceived by\nthe senses, for Kant they are the objects of the correct\ncausal/scientific account of the contents of our outer experience.\nThis causal criterion allows that a spatial object, or, more\nprecisely, the matter from which it is constituted, is (at least\nrelatively) permanent \u2013 which would seem ruled out in\nBerkeley\u2019s position, since the spatial object does not last any\nlonger than the idea does. (Berkeley does say that the ideas of what\n\u201care called real things\u201d differ from \u201cthose excited\nin the imagination\u201d by \u201cbeing less regular, vivid, and\nconstant\u201d (Berkeley 1710, Principles Part I, 33), but\nfor him this difference does not challenge or undermine the claim that\nthe esse of a physical object is its percipi.) None\nof this forces a metaphysical realist as opposed to an idealist\nreading of Kant.\n\nYet at the same time, according to the second concern, the Refutation\nis inadequate even if its ambition is restricted to demonstrating the\nexistence of merely metaphysically ideal but nonetheless\nrecognition-transcendent objects outside us in space. For granting\nthat the Refutation establishes that for me to determine the temporal\norder of my past experiences I must perceive objects in space, it\nfails to show that I need to perceive spatial objects any more\nrealistic than the Berkeleyan ones. More generally, the worry is that\nBerkeleyan version of idealism has the resources to yield as adequate\na reference for me to determine the temporal order of my past\nexperiences as any rival position Kant is plausibly interpreted as\nendorsing, and that for this reason the Refutation falls short of its\naim.\n3. Contemporary World-Directed Transcendental Arguments\n\nKant-inspired transcendental arguments against skepticism about the\nexternal world were developed with vigor in the mid-twentieth century,\nnotably by P. F. Strawson, most famously in his Kantian reflections in\nThe Bounds of Sense (1966). These arguments are often\nreinterpretations of, or at least inspired by, Kant\u2019s\nTranscendental Deduction and his Refutation of Idealism. Some are more\nambitious than Kant\u2019s would seem to be, insofar as they attempt\nto refute some variety of skepticism by showing that there is an\nessential commitment of the skeptical position for which the falsity\nof that position is a necessary condition (Nagel 1997: 60ff.).\nStrawson\u2019s most famous transcendental argument (1966:\n97\u2013104) is modeled on the Transcendental Deduction, but\nexplicitly without a commitment to synthesis or any other aspect of\nKant\u2019s transcendental psychology. His target is a purely\nsense-datum experience, which does not feature objects,\n\u201cconceived of as distinct from any particular states of\nawareness of them,\u201d that is, a Berkeleyan experience of spatial\nobjects whose esse is percipi (1966: 98). The core\nof the argument is as follows. From the premise that every (human)\nexperience is such that it is possible for its subject to become aware\nof it and ascribe it to herself, we can infer that in every experience\nthe subject must be capable of distinguishing a recognitional\ncomponent not wholly absorbed by, and thus distinct from, the item\nrecognized (1966: 100). From this we can infer that the subject must\nconceptualize her experiences in such a way so as to contain the basis\nfor a distinction between a subjective component \u2013 how the\nexperienced item seems to the subject, and an objective component\n\u2013 how the item actually is. Strawson specifies that\n\u201ccollectively,\u201d this comes to \u201cthe distinction\nbetween the subjective order and arrangement of a series of such\nexperiences on the one hand, and the objective order and arrangement\nof the items of which they are the experiences on the other\u201d\n(1966: 101). Conceptualizing experience as involving an objective\norder and arrangement of items amounts to making objectively valid\njudgments about it, which, in turn, implies that experience must\nconsist of a rule-governed connectedness of representations (1966:\n98). Summarizing, from a premise about self-consciousness, we can\ninfer that the subject must conceptualize her experience so as to\nfeature a distinction between \u201cthe subjective route of his\nexperience and the objective world through which it is a route,\u201d\nwhere the experience of the objective world consists in a\nrule-governed order of representations (1966: 105).\n\nBarry Stroud, in his 1968 article \u201cTranscendental\nArguments,\u201d issued a formidable challenge to the enterprise of\ndefeating the external-world skeptic by transcendental arguments of\nthis sort (Stroud 1968). There Stroud contends that such\ntranscendental arguments are undermined by a problem which can be\nstated quite generally. These arguments feature reasoning from some\naspect of experience or knowledge to the claim that the contested\nfeature of the external world in fact exists. In each case the\nexistence of the external feature will not be a necessary\ncondition of the aspect of experience or knowledge in question, for a\nbelief about the external feature would always suffice.\nAlthough the claim about existence of the aspect of the external world\ncould be secured if certain kinds of verificationism or idealism were\npresupposed, these views are highly controversial. Besides, one could\nmake as much of an inroad against the skeptic armed with the\nverificationism or idealism alone, without adducing the transcendental\nargument at all (cf. Brueckner 1983, 1984).\n\nAlthough Strawson\u2019s transcendental argument in The Bounds of\nSense is not a specific target in Stroud\u2019s (1968), Anthony\nBrueckner suggests that it is susceptible to the line of criticism\nthat Stroud develops (Brueckner 1983: 557\u20138). For, arguably,\nStrawson can only conclude that experience must be conceptualized in a\ncertain way, such as to allow the subject to make the distinction\nbetween an objective world and her subjective path through it. This is\nnot a conclusion about how a mind-independent world must be, but only\nabout how it must be thought. (Alternatively, Strawson might be read\nas drawing only a conclusion about how experience must be\nconceptualized, which would render the transcendental argument as one\nof a more modest variety (see below)).\n\nRecent developments of transcendental arguments reflect a struggle to\naccommodate Stroud\u2019s criticism, and often chastened expectations\nabout what such arguments might establish by way of refuting\nskepticism. One more modest sort of transcendental argument begins\nwith a premise about experience or knowledge that is acceptable to the\nskeptic in question, and then proceeds not to the existence of some\naspect of the external world, but in accord with Stroud\u2019s\ncriticism, to a belief in the existence of some aspect of the external\nworld. Stroud himself advocates a strategy of this sort (Stroud 1994,\n1999), as does Robert Stern (1999). The kind proposed by Stroud begins\nwith the premise that we think of the world as being independent of\nus, and it concludes, as a necessary condition of this premise, that\nwe must think of it as containing enduring particulars. Such an\nargument does not claim that as a necessary condition of this premise\nthere must exist such particulars. It contends only for \u201ca\nconnection solely within our thought: if we think in certain ways, we\nmust think in certain other ways\u201d (Stern 1999: 165). A belief or\nthought to which one reasons in this way would, in Stroud\u2019s\nconception, have a certain indispensability, \u201cbecause\nno belief that must be present in any conception or any set of beliefs\nabout an independent world could be abandoned consistently with our\nconception of the world at all,\u201d and it would be\ninvulnerable \u201cin the special sense that it could not be\nfound to be false consistently with its being found to be held by\npeople\u201d (Stern 1999: 166).\n\nStern advances a conception of this kind of argument on which it\naddresses a skeptic who questions whether certain beliefs cohere with\nothers in one\u2019s set, as opposed to a skeptic who questions\nwhether certain beliefs are true (Stern 1999). A modest transcendental\nargument would then aim to show that a belief whose coherence with the\nother beliefs is challenged so coheres after all. The requisite\ncoherence might be demonstrated by showing that the belief in question\nis actually a necessary condition of a belief that is indispensable\n(in some coherentist sense) to one\u2019s set. Mark Sacks (1999)\nobjects that if at the same time one were to admit that the belief\nmight not be true, one\u2019s sense that one is justified in holding\nthe belief would be undermined. This worry is a serious one. Sacks\nargues that it arises because of a tension between the coherentist\ntheory of justification and the realist correspondence theory of truth\nthat the external world skeptic presupposes. One might respond, he\npoints out, by accepting a coherence theory of truth as well, but this\nwould be to adopt a version of idealism. Moreover, it seems that\nSacks\u2019s proposal would not solve the problem, for the reason\nthat even if one accepted a coherence theory of truth, one would still\nhave to admit that for specific instances of a belief one might be\nmistaken, even if one maintained that one was justified in holding\nthat belief on grounds of coherence.\n\nAn important criticism of Stroud\u2019s proposed sort of modest\ntranscendental argument is raised by Brueckner (1996). Brueckner\naddresses the fit between the claim that certain non-skeptical beliefs\nare invulnerable in Stroud\u2019s sense, and the admission that they\nmight not be true. More precisely, he challenges the claim that one\ncan simultaneously affirm the following two principles, each gleaned\nfrom Stroud (1994):\n\n(CT) If we attribute beliefs to speakers (if we believe that they have\nbeliefs with determinate contents), then we must also believe that\nthere is an independent world of enduring objects with which they\ninteract.\n\n\nand\n\n(SK) Although we believe many things about a world independent of us\nand our experiences, \u2026 none of those beliefs is true.\n\n\nBrueckner divides (SK) into\n\nwe believe many things about an external reality independent of us\nand our experiences\n\n\nand\n\nnone of these beliefs is true.\n\n\nStroud argues, in effect, that given CT we cannot believe that (i) and\n(ii) are true, but nonetheless, we can believe that (i) and (ii) are\nlogically compossible given CT. Brueckner argues that using similar\nreasoning, given CT we cannot conceive of a possible world in which\nboth (i) and (ii) hold, and this fact undermines Stroud\u2019s claim.\nTo conceive of a world W in which (i) is true is to conceive of a\nworld in which we (in the actual world) attribute beliefs about\nmind-independent objects to counterfactual versions of us (CVs) in W.\nBut given CT, we must now also conceive of W as featuring\nmind-independent objects with which these CVs interact. Consider the\nCVs\u2019 belief that there exist mind-independent objects\n\u2013 a belief they share with us. This belief of theirs will be\ntrue. And thus in W (ii) will be false. Hence we have not conceived of\na world in which given CT, SK is nevertheless true, and indeed, we\nwill not be able to conceive of such a world. But our not being able\nto conceive of a possible world in which given CT, SK is true,\nconstitutes strong evidence against the claim that SK is logically\npossible given CT (1996: 274\u201375). Brueckner does not think that\nthis argument demonstrates that it is inconsistent to accept CT and\nassert that SK is logically possible, but that there will be no\nevidence of the usual kind for this claim \u2013 evidence from\nconceivability. Thus given the transcendental argument he advances,\nStroud will be pushed in the direction of the immodest conclusion that\nit is not possible for us to be mistaken in our belief that there\nexist mind-independent objects.\n\nFrom this one might be tempted to conclude that despite his critique\nof 1968, Stroud, with Brueckner\u2019s assistance, has found a\ntranscendental argument that does in fact establish a conclusion about\nthe external world. However, so far nothing has been said to turn back\nStroud\u2019s 1968 critique, and it seems much more likely that the\nargument Stroud now advances can at best conclude with a version of CT\nin which the term \u201cindependent\u201d must be read in a\ntranscendentally ideal sense \u2013 in which, for example, the nature\nof certain physical objects is determined by our best scientific\ntheories about them, and our sensory experiences can be in error about\nthese objects. And if this is so, then the argument would secure a\nbelief about the external world only on the presupposition of\nmetaphysical idealism, and this is one of the ways in which\nanti-skeptical transcendental arguments might be doomed according to\nStroud\u2019s 1968 critique.\n\nDespite these sorts of challenges, the aspiration to forge\ntranscendental arguments with considerable anti-skeptical force has\nnot waned. Qassim Cassam (1999), Sacks (2000), and Stern (2000), for\nexample, have developed creative and nuanced versions of\ntranscendental arguments designed to negotiate the type of problem\nStroud has pressed.\n4. Contemporary Practical Transcendental Arguments\n\nKant ethical writings (1785, 1788) feature several widely and\nintensely discussed transcendental arguments (see the entry\n Kant\u2019s moral philosophy).\n As in metaphysics and epistemology, in recent times anti-skeptical\ntranscendental arguments have also been developed in the practical\nsphere.\n\nOne of P. F. Strawson\u2019s most influential works is his essay on\nmoral responsibility, \u201cFreedom and Resentment\u201d (Strawson\n1962). The reasoning in this article has not traditionally been\ninterpreted as a transcendental argument, but recently Justin Coates\nhas made a strong case for such a reading (Coates 2016; cf. Pereboom\n2016). In Coates\u2019s account, the argument begins with the premise\nto which the moral responsibility skeptic would agree, that meaningful\nadult interpersonal relationships are possible for us. It continues by\npointing out that relationships of this sort require that the\nparticipants show each other good will and respect, and that they be\njustified in expecting this of one another. Expectations for good will\nand respect in turn require susceptibility to the reactive attitudes,\nsuch as moral resentment, indignation, and gratitude, and in\nparticular, justified expectations for good will and respect\npresuppose that the participants are apt recipients of these reactive\nattitudes. But to be an apt target of the reactive attitudes is just\nwhat it is to be a morally responsible agent. Consequently, that we\nare morally responsible agents is a necessary condition of the\npossibility for us of meaningful adult interpersonal\nrelationships.\n\nNote that not all the connections among the steps of the argument are\nplausibly instances of appeals to logical or even metaphysical\nnecessary conditions. True, some are: if being an apt target of the\nreactive attitudes is what it is to be a morally responsible agent,\nthe necessary connection invoked would be conceptual or metaphysical.\nBut if expectations for good will and respect do require\nsusceptibility to the reactive attitudes, this would be plausibly a\ncase of nomological necessitation, where the relevant laws are\npsychological. But given the sort of skepticism targeted, nomological\nnecessitation is not too weak a connection; it is not called into\nquestion by the arguments of the moral responsibility skeptic.\n\nCritics have in effect taken issue with a number of steps of this\nargument, for example that expectations for good will and respect\nrequire susceptibility to the reactive attitudes, and that justified\nexpectations for good will and respect presuppose that the\nparticipants are apt recipients of the reactive attitudes. Perhaps\nhuman relationships do not require susceptibility to moral resentment\nand indignation, but only to the nonreactive attitudes of moral\nprotest, disappointment, and sorrow (Pereboom 2022). Another avenue of\ncriticism involves separating moral responsibility from being an apt\ntarget of the reactive attitudes. It may be that a forward-looking,\nthat is, what Strawson calls an \u2018optimistic\u2019 notion of\nresponsibility, is all that\u2019s required for good relationships,\nand it is not characterized by being an apt target of the reactive\nattitudes. But these criticisms are controversial, and\nStrawson\u2019s argument is widely accepted and acclaimed.\n\nAnother prominent transcendental argument in the practical sphere is\nthe sort Christine Korsgaard (1996) develops for Kantian claim that we\nmust value ourselves as rational agents. Here is Robert Stern\u2019s\n(2017) representation of one argument of this sort. The initial\npremise concerns rational choice, and crucially features the notion of\nan agent\u2019s practical identity, the distinctive nature of a\nperson as an agent, which may include, for example, being a parent or\na philosophy professor:\n\nTo rationally choose to do X, you must take it that doing X is the\nrational thing to do.\nSince there is no reason in itself to do X, you can take it that X\nis the rational thing to do only if you regard your practical identity\nas making X the rational thing to do.\nYou cannot regard your practical identity as making doing X the\nrational thing to do unless you can see some value in that practical\nidentity.\nYou cannot see any value in any particular practical identity as\nsuch, but can regard it as valuable only because of the contribution\nit makes to giving you reasons and values by which to live.\nYou cannot see having a practical identity as valuable in this way\nunless you think your having a life containing reasons and values is\nimportant.\nYou cannot regard it as important that your life contain reasons\nand values unless you regard your leading a rationally structured life\nas valuable.\nYou cannot regard your leading a rationally structured life as\nvaluable unless you value yourself qua rational agent.\nTherefore, you must value yourself qua rational agent, if you are\nto make any rational choice.\n\n\nStern (2017) explains this argument as follows. To act is to do or\nchoose something for a reason. However, an agent has reasons to act\nonly because of her practical identity; she does not have reasons to\nact independently of that identity. But a practical identity can yield\nsuch a reason only if she regards that identity as valuable. Merely\nbeing a parent gives one no reason to care for one\u2019s children.\nRather, valuing one\u2019s parenthood has this force. At the same\ntime, an agent cannot regard a particular practical identity as\nvaluable in itself; Korsgaard argues that this sort of realism about\nvalue is implausible. The only remaining explanation is that she\nregards it as valuable because of the contribution it makes to\nproviding her with reasons and values by which to live. But then she\nmust believe that it matters that her life has the sort of rational\nstructure that having such identities provides. However, to see that\nas mattering, she must regard leading a rationally structured life as\nvaluable. Then, in conclusion, to regard leading such a life as\nvaluable, an agent must see her rational nature as valuable.\n5. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe legacy of the arguments such as the Transcendental Deduction and\nthe Refutation of Idealism includes not only Kant\u2019s actual\nsuccesses, but also a number of influential philosophical strategies:\nthe now-standard tactic of arguing for concepts whose source is in the\nmind from universal and necessary features of experience; the idea of\ndrawing significant philosophical conclusions from premises about\nself-consciousness alone; and the notion of a transcendental argument,\nwhich from an uncontroversial premise about our thought, knowledge or\nexperience, reasons to a substantive and unobvious presupposition and\nnecessary condition of this claim.\n",
