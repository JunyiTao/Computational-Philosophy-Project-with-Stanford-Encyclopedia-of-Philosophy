    "main_text": "\n\nRichard Hare left behind at his death a long essay titled \u201cA\nPhilosophical Autobiography\u201d, which was published after his\ndeath. Its opening is striking:\n\n\nI had a strange dream, or half-waking vision, not long ago. I found\nmyself at the top of a mountain in the mist, feeling very pleased with\nmyself, not just for having climbed the mountain, but for having\nachieved my life\u2019s ambition, to find a way of answering moral\nquestions rationally. But as I was preening myself on this\nachievement, the mist began to clear, and I saw that I was surrounded\non the mountain top by the graves of all those other philosophers,\ngreat and small, who had had the same ambition, and thought they had\nachieved it.  And I have come to see, reflecting on my dream, that,\never since, the hard-working philosophical worms had been nibbling\naway at their systems and showing that the achievement was an\nillusion. (2002: 269)\n\n\nYet his imagination could also be less modest: a gaggle of moral\nphilosophers is trapped beneath the earth in a smoke-filled chamber;\nthey talk at cross purposes, and refuse to take the way out into the\nopen air that he alone has discovered. It was his ambition to have\nunited elements from Aristotle, Kant, and Mill in a logically cogent\nway that solved the fundamental problems of ethics (though leaving\nunfinished business), and he usually believed himself to have achieved\nthis. For much of his career, his \u201cprescriptivism\u201d formed\nan important part of the curriculum, certainly in Britain. His\ndisappointment was not to have persuaded others (an occasional\n\u201cwe prescriptivists\u201d was always uncertain of reference),\nand to have left no disciples; he once told John Lucas that this made\nhis life a failure. Yet he leaves behind generations of pupils\ngrateful for the transmission not of a doctrine but of a discipline;\nand posterity, while unlikely to ratify the logical validity of his\ntheory, will have reason to admire it for its uniting of apparent\nopposites, freedom and reason, tradition and rationalism, eclecticism\nand rigor.\n",
