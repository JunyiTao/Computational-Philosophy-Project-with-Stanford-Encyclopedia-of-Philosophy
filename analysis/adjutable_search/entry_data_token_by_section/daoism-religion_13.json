    "main_text": "Main Schools and Lineages || Tang and Five Dynasties\n3.5 Tang and Five Dynasties\n\nThe founding of the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) was accompanied by\nmillenarian prophecies about the advent of a sage-emperor surnamed Li (Bokenkamp\n1994). As we saw before\n (\u00a72.5),\n this was also the surname of the Han-dynasty messiah; four centuries later, the\npowerful Li clan claimed to belong to Laozi\u2019s lineage, and its\nrise to the throne was supported by representatives of the Shangqing\nlineage. The Shangqing patriarch Wang Yuanzhi (528\u2013635) predicted the\nrise of the Tang, informed Li Yuan that he would become the next\nemperor, and secretly transmitted to him the \u201cregisters\u201d\nof the Celestial Mandate (tianming). Li Yuan\u2014the future Emperor Gaozu\u2014finally founded\nthe Tang dynasty. These events marked the beginning\nof the ascent of Shangqing to a status similar to \u201cstate\nreligion\u201d, which it maintained throughout the first half of the\ndynasty (Barrett 1996; Kohn and Kirkland 2000). The support of the\ncourt culminated in ca. 740 with the compilation of the Kaiyuan\ndaozang (Daoist Canon of the Kaiyuan Reign Period), the first of\na series of imperially-sponsored collections of Daoist texts.\n\nWhile the disastrous An Lushan rebellion of 755\u201363 put an end to\nthe glory of the Tang dynasty, for Daoism as a whole the Tang was an\nage of consolidation, but also of major changes and innovations. With\nregard to ritual, the Tang period and the successive decades of the\nFive Dynasties (907\u201360) were marked by two important new\ncodifications, respectively created by Zhang Wanfu (fl. 710\u201313;\nBenn 1991) and by Du Guangting (850\u2013933), one of the foremost\n\u201ccourt Daoists\u201d of all times (Verellen 1989). After its\nintroduction in the 1st century and its development during\nthe Six Dynasties, in the Tang period Buddhism became substantially\n\u201csinified\u201d with the rise of new schools, the most\nimportant of which are Tiantai and Chan (Jpn. Zen), and with the\nspread of \u201cpopular\u201d Tantric practices. (On Daoism and\nBuddhism see Z\u00fcrcher 1980 and Mollier 2008a; for an overview of\nthe main points, see Bokenkamp 2004.) This led to two phenomena that\nbecame constant in the second millennium: competition for state\npatronage, on the one hand, and repeated attempts to synthesize the\n\u201cThree Teachings\u201d (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism), on\nthe other. Intersections of Daoist and Buddhist thought and religion\nare visible in doctrines (Robinet 2004), cults (with several shared\ndeities, e.g., Avalokite\u015bvara/Guanyin; Mollier 2008a,\n174\u2013208), and meditation practices (see\n \u00a79.4).\n\nFinally, this period marked not only the highest stage of development\nof Waidan (External Alchemy), but also the beginnings of\nNeidan (Internal Alchemy; see\n \u00a710).\n The first clearly identifiable Neidan lineage is the Zhong-L\u00fc\n(named after the two immortals, Zhongli Quan and L\u00fc Dongbin),\nwhich appears to have developed from the second half of the Tang\nperiod.\n",
