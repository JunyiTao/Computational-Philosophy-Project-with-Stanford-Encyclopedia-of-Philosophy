    "main_text": "Arguments for Meaning Holism || Indirect Arguments\n2.2 Indirect Arguments\n\nAs stated above, indirect arguments try to bolster the case for\nmeaning holism by undermining the case for its most obvious rivals.\nMolecularism about meaning may initially be the most appealing\nalternative to holism, and indeed, finding a principled way of trying\nto stop the \u201cspreading effect\u201d that seems to follow from\ntaking inferences as relevant to meaning has long been one of the main\nobjectives for molecularists about meaning (Devitt 1993, 1996; Dummett\n1973). Molecularist theories typically try to keep the idea that\nmeaning is tied to inferential role, but insist that only\nsome of the inferences involved with a term constitute its\nmeaning. However, drawing a clear line between the\nmeaning-constitutive and non-meaning-constitutive inferences/beliefs\nseems to commit one to a version of the analytic/synthetic distinction\nthat has been out of favor since Quine\u2019s attack on it (Quine\n 1951),[7]\n and it is a familiar criticism of molecularism that it is an unstable\nresting point between atomism and holism, so that once you give up the\nformer, it is difficult, if not impossible, to find compelling reasons\nnot to move all the way to the latter (Fodor and Lepore 1992, but see\nDevitt 1996).\n\nWhile there have been some attempts to make the distinction without\nbuying into the analytic/synthetic distinction, or to argue that some\nversion of the analytic/synthetic distinction isn\u2019t that bad\nafter all (Boghossian 1996, 2001, 2003; Devitt 1996; Horwich 2005;\nPacherie 1994; Peacocke 1995, 1997; Russell 2008), such views remain\ncontroversial, and an obvious way to avoid the slippery slope into\nmeaning holism is to not even make the first step towards molecularism\nand just keep one\u2019s semantics atomistic (Fodor and Lepore\n1992).\n\nAtomistic semantic theories tend to be causal theories, and\nthese tend to fall into two types: backward and forward looking.\nHolists (and other critics of atomism) typically argue that both types\nof causal account face serious difficulties if they are to remain\natomistic.\n\nBackward looking causal theories inspired by Kripke (1972) and Putnam\n(1975) might have initially seemed like candidates for an atomistic\nsemantics. If what I meant by \u201ccat\u201d were determined by a\ncausal chain leading back to the kind that prompted the first\n\u201cthat\u2019s a cat\u201d utterance, then one might think that\nthe determinants of the meaning of each term could be distinct in the\nway that atomism requires. However, this initial attempt to restrict\nthe determinants to a set of initial baptisms quickly ran aground on\nvarious counterexamples (such as the discussion of\n\u201cMadagascar\u201d (Evans 1973)), and the realization that some\nbeliefs about sortals were needed (since the objects we would\nencounter at any \u201cbaptism\u201d could be counted as instances\nof any number of\n kinds),[8]\n resulted in a the view sliding increasingly towards something that\nwas at least molecularist in\n structure.[9]\n\nForward looking causal theories (which look ahead to the items that\nour concepts cause us to apply terms to rather than back to the ones\nthat first caused us to form the concept), such as those presented by\nwriters working in what can roughly be called \u201cInformation\nSemantics\u201d (Dretske 1981; Fodor 1987, 1990; Stampe 1979), also\nattempt to develop semantic theories that are typically atomistic. The\ntype of use that such atomistic theories must take meaning to be\ndetermined by are typically single applications like \u201ccat\u201d\nor at best \u201cThat\u2019s a cat\u201d, since any more complex\nexamples of use (such as sentences like \u201ccats are mammals\u201d\nor \u201ccats like milk\u201d) run the risk of tying the meaning of\n\u201ccat\u201d to our use of other words in the language (and thus\nto the factors that determine their meaning). However, underwriting a\ndistinction between correct and incorrect use while appealing only to\nsuch simple assertions has proved to be extremely difficult, and there\nis no consensus even among the proponents of such atomistic approaches\nabout what is the most promising way to tackle the problem (see the\ndiscussion of \u201cthe disjunction problem\u201d in Adams &\nAizawa 2010). It has been tried in terms of optimal conditions\n(Papineau 1987), contexts where the term was learned (Dretske 1981)\nasymmetric causal dependence (Fodor 1990), but no such account has\ndone a convincing job of preventing classifications that intuitively\nseem to be errors from being built into the purported extensions of\nour terms. Indeed, it has been argued that the checks on our\ndispositions that these atomistic theories need to get\ntruth-conditions right must include the collateral commitments that\nspeakers have in particular contexts, and that appealing to these will\nlead away from atomism (Boghossian 1989, 1990 (drawing on Kripke\n1982); Jackman 2003b; Podlaskowski 2010). \n\nFurthermore, both the backward and forward looking causal theories run\ninto trouble when dealing with parts of the language other than the\nsorts of kind terms upon which their defenders typically focus. For\ninstance, both sorts of causal theories seem ill-suited for dealing\nwith parts of the language like \u201cbig\u201d, \u201cof\u201d,\n\u201cquickly\u201d, or \u201cunless\u201d, none of which invite\nthe same sort of isolated use that \u201cred\u201d or\n\u201ccat\u201d\n might.[10]\n The atomist might seem to require a different semantic\ntheory for these others parts of speech, while the holist and\nmolecularist can allow that the story about how every word acquires\nits value is uniform throughout the language.\n\nThe meaning holist thus can argue that both atomism and molecularism\nabout meaning face serious\n problems.[11]\n However, unlike the direct arguments, which can establish meaning\nholism in virtue of giving a substantive account of meaning, indirect\narguments typically just make holism seem more plausible by ruling out\nsome of the major alternatives. In particular, meaning holism in the\nsense focused on here isn\u2019t simply entailed by the denial of\natomism and molecularism. The denial of atomism and molecularism leads\nto, at best, the following view:\n\n\nThe determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a\nway that leads a change in the determinants the meaning of\nany single term to produce a change in the determinants of the\nmeanings of each of the\n rest.[12]\n\n\nTo get from this view to full-fledged meaning holism, namely,\n\n\nThe determinants of the meanings of our terms are interconnected in a\nway that leads a change in the meaning of any single term to\nproduce a change in the meanings of each of the rest.\n\n\nOne needs to add the assumption that the function from the\ndeterminants of meaning to the meanings themselves is one-to-one (that\nis, not only does any change to a word\u2019s meaning require some\nchange in the determinants of its meaning, but also that any change to\nthe determinants of a word\u2019s meaning must produce a change to\nits meaning), and doing that will probably require something more like\na \u201cdirect\u201d argument, since it is unlikely that one could\nargue that the function from use to meaning had to be one-to-one\nwithout some sort of substantial account of how use determined\nmeaning.\n",
