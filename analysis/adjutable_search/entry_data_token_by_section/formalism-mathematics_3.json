    "main_text": "Formalism and the Positivists\n4. Formalism and the Positivists\n\nWittgenstein greatly influenced the Vienna Circle. The\n\u2018official\u2019 positivist theory of mathematics, as it were,\nis not a formalist one. Mathematical theorems express truths, albeit\nin a special way: true by virtue of meaning alone. The most\ninfluential positivist has been Carnap, if one does not classify Quine\nas a positivist (but Quine\u2019s views, in the 1930s at any rate,\nwere very close to Carnap\u2019s, indeed arguably Quine remained\ntruer to Carnap\u2019s radical empiricism than Carnap did). And one\ncan certainly discern strong elements of formalism in some of\nCarnap\u2019s writings, for instance in Logische Syntax der\nSprache (1934 [1937]) and \u2018Empiricism, Semantics, and\nOntology\u2019 (1950 [1956]).\n\nThe former book was translated into English as The Logical Syntax\nof Language in 1937. In it, Carnap argued that the correct method\nin philosophy is to engage in conceptual analysis conceived of as\n\u2018logical syntax\u2019, roughly speaking syntax proper and proof\ntheory. To address philosophical differences, one proposes regimenting\nthe disputed positions in formal languages or \u2018frameworks\u2019\nwhich include a system of axioms and rules of proof; given these, some\nsentences are \u2018determinate\u2019, are provable or refutable.\nThese are the analytic, and contradictory, sentences, relative to that\nframework. How do we choose which system to adopt? Carnap\u2019s\nPrinciple of Tolerance (1934 [1937], p. 52) allows us to\nadopt any system we wish:\n\nIn logic, there are no morals. Everyone is at liberty to\nbuild up his own logic, i.e. his own form of language, as he wishes.\n[Italics in original]\n\n\nCarnaps extends this unbridled permissiveness to mathematics:\n\nThe tolerant attitude here suggested is, as far as special\nmathematical calculi are concerned, the attitude which is tacitly\nshared by the majority of mathematicians.\n\n\nAny such calculus can count as a piece of mathematics, even an\ninconsistent one. By downplaying or outright discarding semantic\nnotions, we simply bypass traditional ontological disputes concerning\nthe nature of the entities mathematics is \u2018about\u2019. The\nonly issue is the pragmatic utility, or otherwise, of any given\nmathematical calculus.\n\nA number of concerns arise here. How can Carnap distinguish between\nempirical, scientific theories, and mathematical ones? Secondly, if\npragmatic utility is primarily a matter of empirical applications, how\ndoes the Carnapian formalist know that a given calculus will\nconservatively extend empirical theory, how can this be known without\nappeal to meaningful mathematical results? Carnap writes:\n\nThe formalist view is right in holding that the construction of the\nsystem can be effected purely formally, that is to say without\nreference to the meaning of the symbols; \u2026 But the task which\nis thus outlined is certainly not fulfilled by the construction of a\nlogico-mathematical calculus alone. For this calculus does not contain\n\u2026 those sentences which are concerned with the application\nof mathematics \u2026 For instance, the sentence \u201cIn this\nroom there are now two people present\u201d cannot be derived from\nthe sentence \u201cCharles and Peter are in this room now and no one\nelse\u201d with the help of the logico-mathematical calculus alone,\nas it is usually constructed by the formalists; but it can be derived\nwith the help of the logicist system, namely on the basis of\nFrege\u2019s definition of \u20182\u2019. (Carnap 1934 [1937], p.\n326)\n\n\nadding (italics are Carnap\u2019s) \u2018A structure of this\nkind fulfils, simultaneously, the demands of both formalism and\nlogicism.\u2019\n\nBut what is to stop us freely stipulating, in accordance with the\nprinciple of tolerance, \u2018bridge principles\u2019 for operators\nwhich proof-theoretically behave like numerical operators\u2014\n\u2018the number of \\(\\phi\\)\u2019s\u2019\u2014via their definitional\noccurrence in formulations of arithmetic axioms and where the bridge\nprinciples include the likes of:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\text{the number of }\\phi\\text{\u2019s} &= 0 \\leftrightarrow \\exists x(\\phi x \\amp{\\sim}\\exists y(\\phi y \\amp y \\ne x)) \\\\\n\\text{the number of }\\phi\\text{\u2019s} &= 1 \\leftrightarrow{\\sim}\\exists x\\phi x\\, ?\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThat is, we link the numeral for zero with a sentence stating there is\nexactly one entity of the appropriate type, the numeral for one with a\nsentence stating there are no such entities. If we do so, add the\nrules for standard decimal arithmetic, and then try to apply this\ncalculus, disaster will ensue; but do we not need a\ncontentful conservative extension result to show that for the\ncalculi we do use, no disaster can occur?\n\nG\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems pose very difficult\nproblems for Carnap in this and other regards. The first\nincompleteness theorem tells us that in any \\((\\omega\\)-) consistent\nformal theory whose theorems are recursively enumerable and which\nentails a certain (rather limited) amount of arithmetic, there will be\nan arithmetical sentence such that neither it nor its negation is\nprovable. In Carnap\u2019s terminology, this seems to yield\nnon-determinate sentences, which is a problem for him if we are\nconvinced that nonetheless some of these sentences are true; and\nindeed the key type of sentences used to prove the incompleteness\nresult\u2014\u2018G\u00f6del sentences\u2019\u2014are in fact true\nin the standard model of arithmetic if these sentences are constructed\nin an appropriate way (there are different ways of doing this) from a\ntheory itself true in that model.\n\nG\u00f6del himself wrote, but did not publish, a searching critique of\nCarnap\u2019s position (G\u00f6del, 1953\u20139). G\u00f6del focuses\nnot on his first incompleteness theorem but on the corollary he drew\nin his second theorem: that, under a certain natural characterization\nof the property of consistency, a characterization which can be given\nmathematically via his arithmetization of syntax, no formal theory of\nthe type G\u00f6del considered could prove its own consistency. He\nargued that Carnap, in order to make good his positivistic thesis that\nmathematical theorems are devoid of content, needed to give a\nconsistency proof for mathematical calculi in order to show that they\ndo not have empirical content, an abundance thereof indeed, by dint of\nentailing all empirical sentences. Warren Goldfarb notes, however,\n(1995: 328) that this point fails to appreciate the deep holism of\nCarnap\u2019s 1937 position where the distinction between analytic\nand synthetic is relative to the system in question, the\n\u2018linguistic framework\u2019. (This deep holism, of course, has\nthe counter-intuitive consequence that there is no\nframework-transcendent distinction between mathematics and empirical\nsciences.)\n\nCarnap, in fact, understood the import of G\u00f6del\u2019s theorems\n(Tennant, 2008); he knew of the results directly from G\u00f6del, who\nindeed read drafts of the Logical Syntax. Despite this he\ndisplayed what looks like remarkable insouciance with respect to its\nimplications for his position. He acknowledged the need, in\ndemonstrating consistency, to move to a stronger language (\u00a760c),\nand freely helped himself to mathematical techniques which could in no\nsense be classed as finitary (in \u00a714 he used, for example, rules\nwith infinitely many premisses, notably one which was later to be\ncalled the \\(\\omega\\)-rule). In this way he can deny, for arithmetic at\nleast, that there are any non-determinate sentences since every true\narithmetic sentence is provable using the \\(\\omega\\)-rule (relative to a\nfairly weak finitary logic, considerably weaker than classical\nlogic).\n\nCarnap\u2019s relaxed attitude stems from his abandonment of the\nsearch for epistemological foundations. If one hopes to secure our\nknowledge of mathematics by appeal to a formalist interpretation then\nthe search for a consistency proof of the type Hilbert sought makes\nsense and one will look for a vindication of mathematics as a whole\nfrom within a limited fragment with respect to which our knowledge\nseems hard to impugn. But Carnap, perhaps as a result of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s deep theorems, seems to have abandoned that goal\nand thought that the Principle of Tolerance absolved him of any such\nneed. One can stipulate what one likes, including stronger axiom\nsystems from which one can prove the consistency of a weaker theory.\nThis does not give any firmer grounds for believing or accepting the\nweaker theory, but one does not need such grounds anyway.\n\nFew nowadays look for Cartesian certitude in mathematics, so\nCarnap\u2019s position here may seem reasonable. It is not so clear,\nhowever, that he has answered the problem of applicability. Even if a\nconservative extension result can only be given in a more powerful\nsystem, we need the result to be a contentful truth, not just a string\nof symbols we can derive from some system, if we are to have\nreassurance that a particular calculus we are about to use in\ndesigning bridges or computers will be pragmatically useful. And if\nthe Carnapian grants that the result is a contentful truth, we can ask\nwhat, according to this formalistic position, constitutes that truth.\nCarnap, to be sure, was motivated by a horror of becoming embroiled in\nmetaphysical disputation. But if his standpoint is emptied not only of\nepistemological ambition but is so deflationistic as to say little\nmore than that metamathematical techniques can be applied to\nformalisations of mathematical and scientific theories then it is also\nemptied of all philosophical interest and ceases to make an\nintervention in the debates in philosophy of mathematics.\n\nNot that Carnap really is abandoning metaphysics: this erstwhile\nopponent of metaphysics is really a brother metaphysician with a rival\ntheory of his own, as F. H. Bradley might have said. Thus the main\nimport of the later \u2018Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology\u2019\nis the dismissal of ontological worries as pseudo-problems by dint of\nthe (highly contentious) distinction between \u2018internal\u2019\nquestions, to be settled by the rules of the framework\u2014of\nmathematics, ordinary \u2018thing\u2019 talk or whatever\u2014and\n\u2018external\u2019 questions such as \u2018which framework to\nadopt?\u2019. To these external questions there correspond, Carnap\nclaimed, no propositions with truth values; to no such question, for\nexample, is there a true answer of the form: \u201cYes, infinitely\nmany abstract numbers exist\u201d. Rather, they are to be answered by\ndecisions, decisions to adopt or not based on pragmatic\ncriteria regarding the efficiency, fruitfulness and utility of the\nframework with respect to the aims of the discourse in question. But\nwhat aims could these be? Predicting the flow of \u2018sense\ndata\u2019, taken for granted as forming the ultimate furniture of\nthe world? If so, we see that the vaunted ontological neutrality is a\nsham and we have a radical form of empiricist anti-realist\nmetaphysics.\n\nThe vestige of formalism lies in this: Carnap takes\n\u2018correctness\u2019 to be determined by rules which govern a\nsystem and not to consist, for example, in correspondence with a realm\nof facts independent of the system of rules. And he thinks this\napproach dissolves ontological worries and frees us from any\nobligation to explain how finite, flesh-and-blood creatures like\nourselves could come to have detailed knowledge of this independent\nrealm of facts, this domain of configurations of abstract,\nnon-temporal, non-causal objects and properties, a realm exposed by\nCarnap as a metaphysical illusion. One strong disanalogy with\nformalism is that Carnap takes this line with all areas of\ndiscourse, not just mathematics.\n",
