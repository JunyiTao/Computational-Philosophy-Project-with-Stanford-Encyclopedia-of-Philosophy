    "main_text": "What is transcendental idealism?\n6. What is transcendental idealism?\n\nTranscendental idealism is obviously too complex to clarify simply by\ndiscussing Kant\u2019s views of space and time. A full discussion of\nit would have to range over his critical writings in metaphysics,\naesthetics, teleology, and ethics. But as we have seen, Kant himself\nindicates in the Transcendental Aesthetic that transcendental idealism\nis closely related to his conception of space and time, and so some\nclarity concerning Kant\u2019s overarching philosophical position can\nbe achieved in the context of this entry. The modus operandi,\nas above, will be to probe Kant\u2019s own discussions of the views\nof space and time articulated by his predecessors in order to clarify\nhis own position. In particular, Kant\u2019s remarks concerning\nBerkeley are especially helpful in this context, in addition to his\nremarks on Leibniz and Newton.\n",
