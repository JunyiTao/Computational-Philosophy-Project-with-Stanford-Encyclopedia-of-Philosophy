    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\nFirst let us delimit our field. The examples with which we began are\ntraditionally called \u201cindicative conditionals\u201d. There are\nalso \u201csubjunctive\u201d or \u201ccounterfactual\u201d\nconditionals like \u201cTom would have cooked the dinner if Mary had\nnot done so\u201d, \u201cWe would have been home by ten if the train\nhad been on time\u201d. Counterfactuals will be the subject of a\nseparate entry, and theories addressing them will not be discussed\nhere. That there is some difference between indicatives and\ncounterfactuals is shown by pairs of examples like \u201cIf Oswald\ndidn\u2019t kill Kennedy, someone else did\u201d and \u201cIf\nOswald hadn\u2019t killed Kennedy, someone else would have\u201d:\nyou can accept the first yet reject the second (Adams (1970)). That\nthere is not a huge difference between them is shown by examples like\nthe following: \u201cDon\u2019t go in there\u201d, I say, \u201cIf\nyou go in you will get hurt\u201d. You look sceptical but stay\noutside, when there is large crash as the roof collapses. \u201cYou\nsee\u201d, I say, \u201cif you had gone in you would have got hurt.\nI told you so.\u201d \n\nIt is controversial how best to classify conditionals. According to\nsome theorists, the forward-looking \u201cindicatives\u201d (those\nwith a \u201cwill\u201d in the main clause) belong with the\n\u201csubjunctives\u201d (those with a \u201cwould\u201d in the\nmain clause), and not with the other \u201cindicatives\u201d. (See\nGibbard (1981, pp. 222\u20136), Dudman (1984, 1988), Bennett (1988).\nBennett (1995) changed his mind. Jackson (1990) defends the\ntraditional view.) The easy transition from typical\n\u201cwills\u201d to \u201cwoulds\u201d is indeed a datum to be\nexplained. Still, straightforward statements about the past, present\nor future, to which a conditional clause is attached \u2014 the\ntraditional class of indicative conditionals \u2014 do (in my view)\nconstitute a single semantic kind. The theories to be discussed do not\nfare better or worse when restricted to a particular subspecies.\n\nAs well as conditional statements, there are conditional commands,\npromises, offers, questions, etc.. As well as conditional beliefs,\nthere are conditional desires, hopes, fears, etc.. Our focus will be\non conditional statements and what they express \u2014 conditional\nbeliefs; but we will consider which of the theories we have examined\nextends most naturally to these other kinds of conditional.\n\nThree kinds of theory will be discussed. In \u00a72 we compare\ntruth-functional and non-truth-functional accounts of the truth\nconditions of conditionals. In \u00a73 we examine what is called the\nsuppositional theory: that conditional judgements essentially involve\nsuppositions. On development, it appears to be incompatible with\nconstruing conditionals as statements with truth conditions. \u00a74\nlooks at some responses from advocates of truth conditions. In \u00a75\nwe consider the problem for the suppositional theory of complex\nsentences with conditional parts. In \u00a76 we consider a wider\nvariety of conditional speech acts and propositional attitudes.\n\nWhere we need to distinguish between different interpretations, we\nwrite \u201c\\(A \\supset B\\)\u201d for the truth-functional\nconditional, \u201c\\(A \\rightarrow B\\)\u201d for a\nnon-truth-functional conditional and \u201c\\(A \\Rightarrow B\\)\u201d\nfor the conditional as interpreted by the suppositional theory; and\nfor brevity we call protagonists of the three theories Hook, Arrow and\nSupp, respectively. We use \u201c\\({\\sim}\\)\u201d for negation.\n",
