    "main_text": "The Similarity Conception || Similarity and ER-Problem\n3.1 Similarity and ER-Problem\n\nUnderstood as response to the ER-Problem, the simplest similarity view\nis the following:\n\nSimilarity 1: A scientific model \\(M\\) represents a target\n\\(T\\) iff \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) are similar.\n\nA well-known objection to this account is that similarity has the\nwrong logical properties. Goodman (1976: 4\u20135) points out that\nsimilarity is symmetric and reflexive yet representation isn\u2019t.\nIf object \\(A\\) is similar to object \\(B\\), then \\(B\\) is similar to\n\\(A\\). But if \\(A\\) represents \\(B\\), then \\(B\\) need not (and in fact\nin most cases does not) represent \\(A\\). Everything is similar to\nitself, but most things do not represent themselves. So this account\ndoes not meet our fourth condition of adequacy for an account of\nscientific representation insofar as it does not provide a direction\nto representation.\n\nThere are accounts of similarity under which similarity is not a\nsymmetric relation (see Tversky 1977; Weisberg 2012, 2013: ch. 8; and\nPoznic 2016: sec. 4.2). This raises the question of how to analyse\nsimilarity. We turn to this issue in the next subsection. However,\neven if we concede that similarity need not always be symmetrical,\nthis does not solve Goodman\u2019s problem with reflexivity; nor does\nit, as we will see, solve other problems of the similarity\naccount.\n\nThe most significant problem facing Similarity 1 is that\nwithout constraints on what counts as similar, any two things can be\nconsidered similar (Aronson et al. 1995: 21; Goodman 1972:\n443\u2013444). This has the unfortunate consequence that anything\nrepresents anything else. A natural response to this difficulty is to\ndelineate a set of relevant respects and degrees to which \\(M\\) and\n\\(T\\) have to be similar. This idea can be moulded into the following\ndefinition:\n\nSimilarity 2: A scientific model \\(M\\) represents a target\n\\(T\\) iff \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) are similar in relevant respects and to the\nrelevant degrees.\n\nOn this definition one is free to choose one\u2019s respects and\ndegrees so that unwanted similarities drop out of the picture. While\nthis solves the last problem, it leaves the problem of logical\nproperties untouched: similarity in relevant respects and to the\nrelevant degrees is reflexive (and symmetrical, depending on\none\u2019s notion of similarity). Moreover, Similarity 2\nfaces three further problems.\n\nFirstly, similarity, even restricted to relevant similarities, is too\ninclusive a concept to account for representation. In many cases\nneither one of a pair of similar objects represents the other. This\npoint has been brought home in Putnam\u2019s now-classical thought\nexperiment due to Putnam (1981: 1\u20133). An ant is crawling on a\npatch of sand and leaves a trace that happens to resemble Winston\nChurchill. Has the ant produced a picture, a representation, of\nChurchill? Putnam\u2019s answer is that it didn\u2019t because the\nant has never seen Churchill, had no intention to produce an image of\nhim, was not causally connected to Churchill, and so on. Although\nsomeone else might see the trace as a depiction of Churchill, the\ntrace itself does not represent Churchill. The fact that the trace is\nsimilar to Churchill does not suffice to establish that the trace\nrepresents him. And what is true of the trace and Churchill is true of\nevery other pair of similar items: even relevant similarity on its own\ndoes not establish representation.\n\nSecondly, as noted in\n Section 1,\n allowing for the possibility of misrepresentation is a key desiderata\nrequired of any account of scientific representation. In the context\nof a similarity conception it would seem that a misrepresentation is\none that portrays its target as having properties that are not similar\nin the relevant respects and to the relevant degree to the true\nproperties of the target. But then, on Similarity 2, \\(M\\) is\nnot a representation at all. The account thus has difficulty\ndistinguishing between misrepresentation and non-representation\n(Su\u00e1rez 2003: 233\u2013235).\n\nThirdly, there may simply be nothing to be similar to because some\nrepresentations are not about an actual object. Some paintings\nrepresent elves or dragons, and some models represent phlogiston or\nthe ether. None of these exist. This is a problem for the similarity\nview because models without targets cannot represent what they seem to\nrepresent because in order for two things to be similar to each other\nboth have to exist. If there is no ether, then an ether model cannot\nbe similar to the ether.\n\nAt least some of these problems can be resolved by taking the very act\nof asserting a specific similarity between a model and a\ntarget as constitutive of the scientific representation. Giere (1988:\n81) suggests that models come equipped with what he calls\n\u201ctheoretical hypotheses\u201d, statements asserting that model\nand target are similar in relevant respects and to certain degrees. He\nemphasises that \u201cscientists are intentional agents with goals\nand purposes\u201d (2004: 743) and proposes to build this insight\nexplicitly into an account of representation. This involves adopting\nan agent-based notion of representation that focuses on \u201cthe\nactivity of representing\u201d (2004). Analysing representation in\nthese terms amounts to analysing schemes like\n\n\nAgents (1) intend; (2) to use model, \\(M\\); (3) to represent a part of\nthe world \\(W\\); (4) for purposes, \\(P\\). So agents specify which\nsimilarities are intended and for what purpose. (2010: 274)\n\n\n(see also M\u00e4ki 2009, 2011; although see Rusanen and Lappi 2012:\n317 for arguments to the contrary). This leads to the following\ndefinition:\n\nSimilarity 3: A scientific model \\(M\\) represents a target\nsystem \\(T\\) iff there is an agent \\(A\\) who uses \\(M\\) to represent a\ntarget system \\(T\\) by proposing a theoretical hypothesis \\(H\\)\nspecifying a similarity (in certain respects and to certain degrees)\nbetween \\(M\\) and \\(T\\) for purpose \\(P\\).\n\nThis version of the similarity view avoids problems with\nmisrepresentation because \\(H\\) being a hypothesis, there is no\nexpectation that the assertions made in \\(H\\) are true. If they are,\nthen the representation is accurate (or the representation is accurate\nto the extent that they hold). If they do not, then the representation\nis a misrepresentation. It also resolves the issue with directionality\nbecause \\(H\\) can be understood as introducing an asymmetry that is\nnot present in the similarity relation. However, it fails to resolve\nthe problem with representation without a target. If there is no\nether, no hypotheses can be asserted about it, at least in any\nstraightforward way.\n\nSimilarity 3, by invoking an active role for the purposes and\nactions of scientists in constituting scientific representation, marks\na significant change in emphasis for similarity-based accounts.\nSu\u00e1rez (2003: 226\u2013227), drawing on van Fraassen (2002)\nand Putnam (2002), defines \u201cnaturalistic\u201d accounts of\nrepresentation as ones where\n\n\nwhether or not representation obtains depends on facts about the world\nand does not in any way answer to the personal purposes, views or\ninterests of enquirers.\n\n\nBy building the purposes of model users directly into an answer to the\nER-problem, Similarity 3 is explicitly not a naturalistic\naccount (in contrast to Similarity 1). The shift to users\nperforming representational actions invites the question of it means\nfor a scientist to perform such an action. Boesch (2019) offers an\nanswer which draws on Anscombe\u2019s (2000) account of intentional\naction: something is a \u201cscientific, representational\naction\u201d (Boesch 2019: 312) when a description of a\nscientist\u2019s interaction with a model stands as an earlier\ndescription towards the final description which is some scientific aim\nsuch as explanation, predication, or theorizing.\n\nEven though Similarity 3 resolves a number of issues that\nbeset simpler versions, it does not seem to be a successful\nsimilarity-based solution to the ER-Problem. A closer look at\nSimilarity 3 reveals that the role of similarity has shifted.\nAs far as offering a solution to the ER-Problem is concerned, all the\nheavy lifting in Similarity 3 is done by the appeal to agents\nand their intentions. Giere implicitly concedes this when he observes\nthat similarity is \u201cthe most important way, but probably not the\nonly way\u201d for models to function representationally (2004: 747).\nBut if similarity is not the only way in which a model can be used as\na representation, then similarity has become otiose in a reply to the\nER-problem. In fact, being similar in the relevant respects to the\nrelevant degree now plays the role either of a representational style\nor of a normative criterion for accurate representation, rather than\nconstituting representation per se. We assess in the next\nsection whether similarity offers cogent replies to the issues of\nstyle and accuracy, and we raise a further problem for any account of\nscientific representation that relies on the idea that models,\nspecifically non-concrete models, are similar to their targets.\n",
