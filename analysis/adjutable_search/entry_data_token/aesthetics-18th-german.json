But Baumgarten\u2019s denomination of the\nfield was an adult baptism: without a name, aesthetics had been part\nof philosophy since Plato attacked the educational value of poetry in\nthe Republic and Aristotle briefly defended them in his\nfragmentary Poetics. In particular, Aristotle defended poetry\nfrom Plato\u2019s charge that it is cognitively useless, trading in mere\nimages of particulars rather than universal truths, by arguing that\npoetry delivers universal truths in a readily graspable form, unlike,\nfor example, history, which deals merely with particular facts\n(Aristotle, Poetics, chapter 9, 1451a37\u20131451b10). And\nif experience of poetry can reveal important moral truths, then it can\nalso be important to the development of morality, the other pole of\nPlato\u2019s doubts. Some variant of this response to Plato was the core of\naesthetics through much of subsequent philosophical history, and\nindeed continued to be central to aesthetics through much of the\ntwentieth century. In the eighteenth century, however, two alternative\nresponses to Plato were introduced.  One may be regarded as taking up\nAristotle\u2019s idea in the Poetics that \u201ckatharsis,\u201d\npurification or purgation, of the emotions of fear and pity, is a\nvaluable part of our response to a tragedy; this led to an emphasis on\nthe emotional impact of aesthetic experience that was downplayed in\nthe cognitivist tradition. This line of thought was emphasized by\nJean-Baptiste Du Bos in his Critical Reflections on Poetry,\nPainting, and Music, published in France in 1719 and widely known\nthroughout Europe even before it was translated into other languages.\nThe other innovation was the idea that our response to beauty, whether\nin nature or in art, is a free play of our mental powers that is\nintrinsically pleasurable, and thus needs no epistemological or moral\njustification, although it may in fact have epistemological and moral\nbenefits. This line of thought was introduced in Britain in Joseph\nAddison\u2019s 1712 Spectator essays on \u201cThe Pleasures of\nthe Imagination,\u201d and developed by subsequent Scottish writers\nsuch as Francis Hutcheson, Henry Home (Lord Kames), and Alexander\nGerard. It was only slowly received in Germany, hinted at by Moses\nMendelssohn in the late 1750s, who also took up Du Bos\u2019 emphasis on\nthe emotional impact of aesthetic experience, but then made its first\nsustained appearance in the emphasis on the pleasure of the unhindered\nactivity of our powers of representation in some of the entries in\nJohann Georg Sulzer\u2019s Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen\nK\u00fcnste (1771\u201374), e.g., the entries on\n\u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201ctaste\u201d (Sulzer, Allgemeine\nTheorie, vol.  II, pp. 371\u201385, at p. 371, and\n\u201cSch\u00f6n (Sch\u00f6ne K\u00fcnste),\u201d vol. IV,\npp. 305\u201319, at p. 307). It became central to the aesthetic\ntheories of Kant and Schiller in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment (1790) and the Letters on the Aesthetic Education of\nMankind (1795). This article will chronicle the interaction\nbetween the traditional theory of aesthetic experience as a special\nform of the cognition of truth and the newer theories of aesthetic\nexperience as a free play of cognitive (and sometimes other) mental\npowers and as a vicarious experience of emotions in eighteenth-century\nGermany.\n", "toc": [{"#LeiWolPerTru": "1.

Leibniz and Wolff: Perfection and Truth\n\n\nThe traditional idea that art is a special vehicle for the expression\nof important truths is the basis for the work of the philosopher who\nestablished the framework for German thought for much of the\n18th century, namely, Christian Wolff\n(1679\u20131754). Wolff never devoted a whole work to aesthetics, but\nmany of the ideas that would influence subsequent aesthetic theory are\ncontained in his Rational Thoughts on God, the World, and the Soul\nof Man, his \u201cGerman Metaphysics,\u201d first published in\n1719.\n\n\nOriginally appointed to teach mathematics at the Pietist-dominated\nuniversity of Halle, Wolff was inspired by both the mathematical and\nphilosophical genius of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646\u20131716),\nbut published a vast systematic statement of a philosophy that was\nconstructed partly although by no means wholly on Leibnizian lines in\na way that Leibniz himself never did. Wolff\u2019s collected works (over\nthirty volumes in German and forty in Latin) include German versions\nof his logic, metaphysics, ethics, political philosophy, and teleology\nas well as a four-volume encyclopedia of mathematical subjects. In\naddition, there are expanded Latin versions of the logic, the\ncomponents of metaphysics including ontology, rational cosmology,\nempirical psychology, rational psychology, and natural psychology, as\nwell as another four-volume mathematical compendium, seven volumes on\nethics, and no fewer than twelve volumes on political philosophy and\neconomics. In all of this vast output, the only thing that might look\nlike a work specifically in aesthetics is a treatise on architecture\nincluded in his encyclopedia of mathematics. That very placement\nindicates that Wolff regarded the discussion of architecture as part\nof the theory of science; and in the Preliminary Discourse on\nPhilosophy in General that prefaces his Latin restatement of his\nsystem, Wolff states more generally that a \u201cphilosophy of the\narts\u201d is possible, but as part of \u201ctechnics or\ntechnology,\u201d \u201cthe science of the arts and of the works of\nart\u201d (Wolff, Preliminary Discourse, \u00a771,\np. 38). Here Wolff uses the term \u201cart\u201d (ars) in\nthe ancient sense of techne, which means any form of craft\nrequiring both aptitude and training, rather than in the specifically\nmodern sense of \u201cfine art.\u201d In his German works, Wolff\nuses the word Kunst in the same broad way. Even with regard\nto something closer to the fine arts, however, he says that\n\u201cThere could also be a philosophy of the liberal arts, if they\nwere reduced to the form of a science\u2026.one might talk about\nrhetorical philosophy, poetical philosophy, etc.\u201d (ibid.,\n\u00a772, p. 39). Wolff certainly does not have the idea of the fine\narts as a domain of human production and response that differs in some\nessential way from all other forms of human production and response,\nthus he does not have the idea of aesthetics as a discipline that will\nfocus on what distinguishes the fine arts and our response to them\nfrom everything else.  Nevertheless, in the course of his works he\nintroduces some ideas about both the fine arts and our response to\nthem that will be seminal for the next half-century of German\nthought.\n1.1 Leibniz\n The two key ideas that Wolff takes from Leibniz are, first, the\ncharacterization of sensory perception as a clear but confused rather\nthan distinct perception of things that could, at least in principle,\nbe known both clearly and distinctly by the intellect; and, second,\nthe characterization of pleasure as the sensory, and thus clear but\nconfused, perception of the perfection of things. Leibniz\u2019s conception\nof sensory perception was presented in a 1684 paper entitled\n\u201cMeditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas.\u201d Here Leibniz\nstated that \u201cKnowledge is clear\u2026when it makes it\npossible for me to recognize the thing represented,\u201d but that it\nis \u201cconfused when I cannot enumerate one by one the\nmarks which are sufficient to distinguish the thing from others, even\nthough the thing may in truth have such marks and constituents into\nwhich its concept can be resolved.\u201d Conversely, knowledge is\nboth clear and distinct when one can not only clearly distinguish its\nobject from other objects but can also enumerate the\n\u201cmarks\u201d or properties of the object on which that\ndistinction is based.  Leibniz then says that sensory perception is\nclear but indistinct or confused knowledge, and illustrates his\ngeneral thesis about sense perception with a remark about the\nperception and judgment of art: \u201cLikewise we sometimes see\npainters and other artists correctly judge what has been done well or\nbadly; yet they are often unable to give a reason for their judgment\nbut tell the inquirer that the work which displeases them lacks\n\u2018something, I know not what\u2019\u201d (Leibniz,\n\u201cMeditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas,\u201d\np. 291). This illustration would be decisive for Wolff and all of\nthose whom he in turn influenced.\n\n\nThe second idea that Wolff took over from Leibniz is the idea that\npleasure is itself the sensory perception of the perfection existing\nin an object. For Leibniz and all his followers, all of the properties of actually existing objects can\nbe regarded as perfections, since they held that the actual world is\nthe one selected to exist by God from among all possible worlds\nprecisely because it is the most perfect; thus each object and all of\nits properties must in some way contribute to the maximal perfection\nof the actual world. But they also used the concept of perfection in a\nmore ordinary way, in which some actual objects have specific\nperfections that others do not, and it is this sense of perfection\nthat Leibniz employed when he stated that\n\nPleasure is the feeling of a perfection or an excellence,\nwhether in ourselves or in something else. For the perfection of other\nbeings is also agreeable, such as understanding, courage, and\nespecially beauty in another human being, or in an animal or even in a\nlifeless creation, a painting or a work of craftsmanship, as\nwell.\n\n\nLeibniz also holds that the perfection that we perceive in other\nobjects is communicated to ourselves, although he does\nnot say that our pleasure in the perception of perfection is actually\ndirected at the self-perfection that is thereby caused. But there is\ncertainly a nascent view here that the perception of beauty in art,\nalthough not only in art, is both intrinsically pleasurable and also\ninstrumentally valuable because it leads to self-improvement.\n1.2 Wolff\n\nThis is the background from which Wolff\u2019s own hints toward aesthetics\nemerged. Wolff introduces the central concepts and principles of his\nontology in the second chapter of his German metaphysics, which deals\nwith \u201cThe first grounds of our cognition and all things in\ngeneral\u201d (German Metaphysics, p. 66). After expounding\nthe formal principles that are the basis of all truth, the principles\nof non-contradiction and sufficient reason, Wolff introduces the\nconcept that is the substantive basis of his ontology, namely the\nconcept of perfection. He defines perfection as the\n\u201charmony\u201d or \u201cconcordance\u201d\n(Zusammenstimmung) of a manifold or multiplicity of objects\nor parts of objects\u2014or as he says in Latin, perfectio est\nconsensus in varietate (Wolff, Ontologia, \u00a7503,\np. 390)\u2014and illustrates this abstract definition with the\nexample of a work of technology:\n\n\n E.g., one judges the perfection of a clock from its correctly\n displaying the hours and their parts. It is however composed of many\n parts, and these and their composition are aimed at the hands\n displaying correctly the hours and their parts. Thus in a clock one\n finds manifold things, that are all in concordance with one another.\n (Wolff, German Metaphysics, \u00a7152, p. 152)\n\n\nHere Wolff defines perfection in both formal and substantive terms:\nformally, simply as the order or harmony of the parts in a whole; but\nsubstantively, as the suitability of that order or harmony of parts\nfor achieving the aim that is intended for the whole, such as\naccurately telling time in the case of a clock.\n\n\nWhen we turn to Wolff\u2019s conceptions of the perfections of the\nparticular forms of art that he mentions, we see that he always\nhas in mind both formal and substantive perfections for any particular\nart. Wolff also identifies order in\nthings with truth. He says that\n Since everything has its sufficient ground why it\nis, there must also always be a sufficient ground for why in simple\nthings the alterations succeed one another just so and not otherwise,\nand why in composite things their parts are juxtaposed just thus and\nnot otherwise, and also their alterations succeed one another just so\nand not otherwise.\n\n\nHe contrasts this order with the disorder that reigns in dreams,\nand then says that\nAccordingly truth is nothing other than\n order in the alternations of things while the dream is\n disorder in the alteration of things. (German Metaphysics,\n \u00a7142, pp.  146\u20138)\n\n\nIn a 1729 lecture on \u201cThe enjoyment that\n one can derive from the cognition of truth,\u201d Wolff does not in\n the first instance treat truth as a semantic correspondence between a\n linguistic representation and the object represented, or an epistemic\n relation between a mental representation and an external reality, but\n as an objective property consisting in coherence within things\n themselves, which is precisely what perfection consists in as\n well. But there is nevertheless a strongly cognitivist cast to\n Wolff\u2019s aesthetics.\n\n\nWolff next defines clarity and distinctness and indistinctness in\ncognition. Thoughts are clear \u201cwhen we know well what we think,\nand can distinguish that from other things\u201d; they are obscure if\nwe cannot even distinguish the objects of our thoughts from other\nobjects (German Metaphysics, \u00a7\u00a7198\u20139, p.\n188). Clear thoughts are also distinct if we not only know what\nobjects we are thinking of but if \u201cour thoughts are also clear\nwith respect to their parts or the manifold that is to be found in\nthem\u201d (German Metaphysics, \u00a7207, p. 194), and are\notherwise indistinct or confused. Wolff then defines sensations\n(Empfindungen) as those thoughts \u201cwhich have their\nground in the alterations of the members of our body and which are\noccasioned by corporeal things outside us,\u201d and the\n\u201ccapacity for having sensations as the senses\u201d\n(German Metaphysics, \u00a7220, p. 202). He then adopts\nLeibniz\u2019s view that sensations or sensory perceptions are typically\nclear but indistinct or confused (German Metaphyics,\n\u00a7214, p. 198). Unlike Leibniz, the systematic Wolff observes that\nsensations come in differing degrees of clarity (German\nMetaphysics, \u00a7224, p. 206), but they are nevertheless all\nindistinct to some degree. This means that at least in principle a\npurely intellectual or conceptual representation is always a better\nsource of knowledge of its object than is a sensory representation of\nit.\n\n\nThis in turn means that an aesthetic perception of a perfection is\nalways a less than optimal cognition of that perfection, for having\ndescribed sense perception or sensory cognition as clear but\nindistinct or confused, Wolff next defines pleasure as the sensory or\n\u201cintuitive\u201d cognition of perfection. In his German\nmetaphysics, he writes that \u201cInsofar as we intuit perfection,\npleasure arises in us, thus pleasure is nothing other than an\nintuition of perfection, as Descartes already remarked\u201d\n(German Metaphysics, \u00a7404, p. 344). Wolff\u2019s successors\nwill struggle to avoid the limitations on the cognitive significance\nof aesthetic response that follow from his definition of pleasure as a\nkind of sense perception and the limits he places on the cognitive\nsignificance of sense perception.\n\n\nWhile Wolff\u2019s basic account of pleasure is problematic, he does\nprovide a straightforward account of beauty. Wolff defines beauty as\nthe perfection of an object insofar it can be perceived by us with and\nthrough the feeling of pleasure: \u201cBeauty consists in the\nperfection of a thing, insofar as it is suitable for producing\npleasure in us\u201d (Psychologia Empirica, \u00a7544,\np. 420).  This definition enunciates a clear position on the\nontological status of beauty, which will often be vexed in the\neighteenth century.  Beauty is an objective property, founded in the\nperfection of things, but it is also a relational rather than\nintrinsic property, for it is attributed to perfection only insofar as\nthere are subjects like us who can perceive it sensorily. Given\nperceivers like us, beauty is coextensive with or emergent from\nperfection, but in a universe without such perceivers perfection would\nnot be equivalent to beauty.\n\n\nThus far we have considered only Wolff\u2019s most abstract definition of\nperfection and therefore of beauty, namely that it is the coherence of\na manifold insofar as we can perceive that through the sensation of\npleasure. When he mentions or discusses specific arts, Wolff invokes\nmore specific conceptions of perfection and thus of the beauties of\nthose arts. In the case of the visual arts of painting and sculpture,\nWolff locates their perfection in imitation or veridical\nrepresentation, while other arts find their perfections in the\nfulfillment of intended uses. He uses the examples of painting and\narchitecture in the German metaphysics to illustrate his claim that\npleasure arises from the intuition of perfection. Thus,\nthe perfection of a painting consists in its\nsimilarity. For since a painting is nothing other than a\nrepresentation of a given object on a tablet or flat surface,\neverything in it is harmonious if nothing can be discerned in it that\none does not also perceive in the thing itself,\n\n\nand\nif a connoisseur of architecture contemplates a\n building that has been constructed in accordance with the rules of\n architecture, he thereby cognizes its perfection. (German\n Metaphysics, \u00a7404, p. 344)\n\n\nWolff frequently reiterates that the perfection of painting or\nsculpture consists in accurate representation without further\namplification (\u201cOn the enjoyment that can be derived from the\ncognition of truth,\u201d \u00a77, p. 257, and Psychologia\nEmpirica, \u00a7512, pp. 389\u201390, and \u00a7544,\npp. 420\u20131); he is simply using what he takes to be a\nnon-controversial fact about painting to confirm his connection of\npleasure with the intuition of perfection. In his extended discussion\nof architecture, however, he reveals a more subtle conception of the\nperfections and thus the \u201crules\u201d of architecture.  In order for us to\nperceive it as beautiful, a building must display both the formal\nperfection of coherence as well as the substantive perfection of being\nsuitable, indeed comfortable for its intended use.\n\n\nWolff begins his treatise on the Foundations of Architecture\nwith the claim that \u201carchitecture is a science for constructing\na building so that it is in complete correspondence with the\nintentions of the architect\u201d (Wolff, Principles of\nArchitecture, \u00a71, p. 305). This locates the harmony or\nagreement in which perfection always consists in the relation between\nthe intentions of the architect and the building that results from his\nplans and supervision. However, as he proceeds Wolff makes it clear\nthat the intention of an architect is always to produce a structure\nthat is both formally beautiful as well as useful and comfortable, so\nthe perfection that subsists in the relation between intention and\noutcome in fact consists in the perfection of both form and utility in\nthe building itself. On the one hand \u201cA\nbuilding is space that is enclosed by art in order that certain\nfunctions can proceed there securely and unhindered\u201d\n(Architecture, \u00a74, p. 306), and \u201cA building\nis comfortable if all necessary functions can proceed within it\nwithout hindrance and vexation\u201d (Architecture, \u00a77,\np.  307). These definitions form the basis for a requirement of\nperfection in the utility of a building. On the other hand, however,\n\u201cBeauty is perfection or the necessary appearance thereof,\ninsofar as the former or the latter is perceived, and causes a\npleasure in us\u201d (Architecture, \u00a78, p. 307), and \u201cA building must be constructed beautifully\nand decoratively\u201d (Architecture, \u00a718, p. 309).\nThis is the basis for the requirement of formal rather than\nutilitarian perfection in a building. Throughout the remainder of the\ntreatise, both conceptions of perfection are at work. Wolff does not\nexplicitly extend this complex analysis of perfection to other arts,\nalthough it is not difficult to imagine how that extension might go:\nin painting we might respond to formal features of composition as well\nas to the accuracy of depiction, in sculpture we might respond to the\nintrinsic beauty of the marble or bronze as well as to the accuracy of\ndepiction, and so on.\n\n\nFinally, we must ask about the moral and religious implications of\nWolff\u2019s contributions to aesthetics. As we have seen, Wolff equates\nperfection, which is the object of pleasure in all contexts including\nthose subsequently labeled aesthetic, with an objective sense of\ntruth. However, and in this regard most unlike the German\naestheticians of the next several generations who are so strongly\ninfluenced by him in other regards, he has nothing to say about the\narts that are typically paradigmatic for those who ground their\naesthetics on the notion of truth rather than that of play, namely\nliterature, especially poetry and drama. Thus he does not consider the\nparadox of tragedy, formulated by Du Bos and then discussed by\nvirtually every other eighteenth-century writer on literature, nor\ndoes he emphasize the moral benefits of uplifting literature, as so\nmany others do. Indeed, he has nothing explicit to say about the moral\nbenefits of aesthetic experience, nor does he directly consider the\nreligious significance of such experience in any of his discussions of\nit. Nevertheless, it is clear that aesthetic experience does have\nreligious significance for Wolff, because his philosophy culminates in\na religious teleology. For Wolff, the most perfect and therefore most\norderly of all possible worlds exists for a reason, namely to mirror\nthe perfection of God, and sentient and cognizant beings such as\nourselves exist for a reason, namely to recognize and admire the\nperfection of God that is mirrored in the perfection of things in the\nworld and of the world as a whole. The perfection that is added to the\nnatural world through human artistry is also part of the perfection of\nthe world that emanates from and mirrors the perfection of God. Thus,\nin admiring the perfection of art we are performing part of our larger\nfunction in the world, namely admiring the perfection of God. Wolff\nstates the premise of his teleology quite clearly in a work devoted\nentirely to that subject, the Rational Thoughts on the Aims of\nNatural Things, or \u201cGerman teleology.\u201d There he\ndeclares that\nThe chief aim of the world is this, that we should\n cognize the perfection of God from it. Now if God would attain this\n aim, he also had to arrange the world in such a way that a rational\n being could extract from the contemplation of it grounds that would\n allow him to infer with certainty the properties of God and what can\n be known about him. (Rational Thoughts on the Aims of Natural\n Things, \u00a78, p. 6)\n\n\nSeveral sections later, he uses the metaphor of\nthe mirror to describe the relation between God, the world, and we who\nlook at the mirror:\nNow if the world is to be a mirror of the wisdom\n of God, then we must encounter divine aims in it and perceive the\n means by which he attains these aims\u2026. And accordingly the\n connection of things in the world with one another makes it into a\n mirror of [God\u2019s] wisdom\u2026. (ibid., \u00a714, pp.  18\u201319;\n see also German Metaphysics, \u00a71045, p.\n 802)\n\n\n\nWolff writes as a spokesman for the Enlightenment, and he is emphatic\nthat God reveals his wisdom and power not by intervening in the course\nof the world by means of miracles, but rather by designing everything\nin the world as if it were all smoothly-running machines that can\nachieve his goals without further intervention (see German\nMetaphysics, \u00a71037, p. 796). This might seem to leave no\nroom at all for the human creation of art, which all\neighteenth-century writers will conceive of as a production of genius\nthat is the complete opposite of anything mechanical. But for Wolff\nour ability to produce works of art is another manifestation of the\nperfection of the world\u2014of which we are a part\u2014and in turn\nof God. Wolff draws no distinction between the works of human art that\nare the subject of the \u201cscience of art\u201d and the works of\nnature, nor for that matter any distinction between the works of human\nart that are the subject of the \u201cscience of art\u201d and those\nhuman creations that are the subjects of the \u201cdoctrine of morals\nand statecraft\u201d: they are all forms of perfection which, in a\nteleological natural theology, all ultimately mirror the perfection of\nGod. And no doubt Wolff hardly thought it necessary to spell out the\nmoral benefits of such a recognition.\n2. Gottsched and His Critics: Truth and Imagination\n\n\nIn Wolff\u2019s description of the experience of beauty as the\n\u201csensitive cognition of perfection,\u201d cognition is\nnaturally understood as knowledge of truth, so in the first instance\nWolff\u2019s formula meant that the experience of beauty is knowledge of\ntruth by means of the senses. Yet Wolff\u2019s conception of perfection was\nbroad enough to include successful adaptation to an intended purpose,\nand thus in his analysis of our experience of architecture he\nemphasized our sense of the utility of structures as well as a sensory\nresponse to the kind of abstract form that could be considered an\nobject of cognition.  But it was the idea that aesthetic experience is\na sensory apprehension of truth that dominated in Wolff\u2019s most general\nstatements.  After 1720, Wolff\u2019s philosophy enjoyed an influence in\nmost parts of Germany similar to that which the philosophy of Locke\nexercised in most quarters in Britain by then and in France beginning\na decade or two later. So the history of German aesthetics after Wolff\nis a history of the attempt to find room for a fuller account of\naesthetic experience within a framework that privileges the idea of\ncognition, and only gradually was room found for the idea that the\nfree play of our mental powers, including not only imagination but at\nleast for some authors also emotion, could be equally important. The\nfirst round of this struggle was a debate extending from the late\n1720s until the 1740s between the Leipzig literary figure Johann\nChristoph Gottsched and the Z\u00fcrich critics Johann Jacob Bodmer and\nJohann Jacob Breitinger, in which the issue was really just how much\nroom there could be for the freedom of imagination within a theory of\npoetry based on the idea that poetry is a truthful imitation of\nnature. This might be understood as an early form of debate over how\nmuch room there is for the free play of imagination in aesthetic\nexperience.\n\n\nFrom a distance of almost three hundred years, the differences between\nthe \u201ccritical poetics\u201d (critische Dichtkunst) of\nJohann Christoph Gottsched and his critics may seem small, because to\nus they are all so clearly working within the paradigm established by\nWolff. Yet in the 1730s and 1740s their debate was intense, not just\nbecause Gottsched was a self-important controversialist who clearly\nenjoyed being on center stage, but also because their debate about the\nproper scope and power of the imagination was both theoretically\ninteresting and reflected a tectonic shift in German taste. This shift\nis away from the French classicism represented by Racine and Corneille\nto the freer forms of Milton and Shakespeare, which in turn lead to\nthe pan-European romanticism of the later eighteenth and early\nnineteenth centuries.\n2.1 Gottsched\n\nJohann Christoph Gottsched (1700\u201366) was born in K\u00f6nigsberg\nand studied philosophy there.  He began teaching philosophy there in\n1723, but fled the Prussian draft the next year and settled in the\nSaxon city of Leipzig, where Leibniz had earlier studied. Leipzig is\nonly thirty kilometers away from Halle, the Prussian city where Wolff\nhad been teaching for two decades; but Wolff had been driven from\nHalle in 1722 by the reaction to his argument that the\n\u201catheistic\u201d Chinese could arrive at the same moral truths\nas Christian Europeans by the use of human reason alone. So Gottsched\nmay never have met Wolff. Nevertheless, he had already been exposed to\nWolffian philosophy in K\u00f6nigsberg, and his two-volume Erste\nGr\u00fcnde der gesamten Weltweisheit (\u201cFirst Principles of\nall Philosophy,\u201d 1733\u201334), which includes an extensive\nreview of natural science as well as logic, metaphysics, and ethics,\nbecame the most widely adopted textbook of Wolffian\nphilosophy. However, although he eventually held the professorship in\nlogic and metaphysics in Leipzig, Gottsched was also the professor of\npoetry, and by far the greatest part of his boundless energy was\ndevoted to literature and philology. In the history of aesthetics, his\nreputation rests on his Versuch einer critischen Dichtkunst vor\ndie Deutschen (\u201cEssay toward a Critical Poetics for the\nGermans,\u201d 1730, with further editions in 1737, 1742, and\n1751).\n\n\nThe practical aim of the Critical Poetics was to elevate the\ntone of German popular theater and moderate the Baroque excesses of\nthe upper-class theater by recommending the model of the classical\nFrench theater of Racine and Corneille. The theoretical basis of the\nwork was the Wolffian principle that the theater and other forms of\npoetry (Gottsched had little to say about the emerging medium of the\nnovel) should be used to convey important moral truths through images\nthat would make them accessible and engaging for a wide audience.\nGottsched stated his position a year before the Critical\nPoetics in a speech with the anti-Platonic title \u201cPlays and\nespecially tragedies are not to be banished from a well-ordered\nrepublic\u201d where he defined a tragedy as\nan instructive moral poem, in which an important\naction of preeminent persons is imitated and presented on the\nstage. (Gottsched, Schriften, p. 5)\n\n\nHe revealed the underlying premise of his\nargument when he observed that\nThe improvement of the human heart is not a work\nwhich can happen in an hour. It requires a thousand preparations, a\nthousand circumstances, much knowledge, conviction, experiences,\nexamples and encouragement\u2026. (Schriften, p. 9)\n\n\nIt would become a central theme of German\nEnlightenment aesthetics that even if people know the general truths\nof morality in some abstract way, the arts can make those truths\nconcrete, alive, and effective for them in a way that nothing else\ncan. The Critical Poetics opens with a brief history of\npoetry rather than with a statement of theoretical principles, but its\nfirst chapter concludes with a similar suggestion that the point of\npoetry is to make moral truths alive through their presentation in a\nform accessible to our senses: \u201cThe arousal of affects\nis\u2026much livelier\u201d in tragedy and comedy than anywhere\nelse,\nbecause the visible representation of persons is\nfar more sensibly touching than the best description. The manner of\nwriting is, especially in tragedy, noble and sublime, and it has\nrather a superfluity than a lack of instructive sayings. Even comedy\nteaches and instructs the observer, although it arouses\nlaughter. (Schriften, p. 33)\n\n\nThe details of Gottsched\u2019s view emerge in the\nsucceeding chapters on \u201cThe character of a poet\u201d and\n\u201cOn the good taste of a poet.\u201d\n\n\nIn the first of these chapters, Gottsched defines a poet as one who\nproduces imitations of nature:\n\n\nA poet is a skilled imitator of all natural things; and this he has in\ncommon with painters, connoisseurs of music, etc. He is however\ndistinguished from these by the manner of his imitation and the means\nthrough which he achieves it. The painter imitates nature with brush\nand colors; the musician through beat and harmony; the poet, however,\nthrough a discourse that is rhythmic or otherwise well arranged; or,\nwhich is much the same, through a harmonious and good-sounding text,\nwhich we call a poem. (Schriften, p.  39)\n\n\n\nGottsched goes on to argue that a poet must have a sharp wit or\nacumen, a \u201cpower of mind which readily perceives the similarity\nof things and thus can make a comparison among them,\u201d but also\nthat such a \u201cnatural gift\u201d is \u201cin itself still raw\nand imperfect if it is not awaked and cleansed of the incorrectness\nthat clings to it\u201d (Schriften, p. 44).\n\n\nFor the wit of a poet to lead to good results, it must therefore be\naccompanied with \u201cart and learning,\u201d \u201cextensive\nscholarship,\u201d and a strong \u201cpower of judgment,\u201d\nincluding sound moral judgment, because his task is to make moral\ntruths accessible to his audience through his imitations.  All of\nthese capacities require cultivation; once they have been cultivated,\nthe artist can better fulfill his double task of imitation: through\nthe imitation of worthy deeds in the medium of his art, he is to\nencourage his audience to the performance of similarly worthy deeds\nthemselves.\n\n\nThus far, Gottsched has not made special use of Wolffian terms. His\nensuing discussion of the \u201cgood taste of a poet\u201d is more\nexplicitly Wolffian. Gottsched begins by characterizing taste in its\nliteral sense\u2014the taste of food or drink\u2014as a form of\nrepresentation \u201cthat for all of its clarity has nothing distinct\nin it.\u201d He then states that in its \u201cmetaphorical\u201d\nsense taste is always associated with the \u201cliberal arts and\nother sensible things,\u201d such as \u201cpoetry, oratory, music,\npainting, and architecture, likewise in dress, gardens, household\nfurnishings, etc.,\u201d not with subjects \u201cwhere it is a\nmatter of reason alone\u201d and \u201cwhere it is possible to make\nthe strictest demonstrations from distinctly cognized fundamental\ntruths,\u201d such as \u201carithmetic and geometry or other\nsciences\u201d (Schriften, pp. 60\u20131).  Thus\n\u201cmetaphorical as well as ordinary taste has to do only with\nclear but not entirely distinct concepts of things, and distinguishes\nfrom one another the sort of things that one judges in accordance with\nmere sensation.\u201d However, although it follows from the fact that\njudgments of taste are made on the basis of \u201cclear but not\nentirely distinct concepts\u201d that \u201cpeople who judge merely\non the basis of taste\u201d can arrive at opposite conclusions,\nGottsched holds that such opposed judgments cannot both be true, and\nthat there must be a true fact of the matter to which one but not the\nother of them corresponds. In other words, although judgments of taste\nare made on the basis of clear but indistinct concepts, which is to\nsay sensory perceptions and feelings rather than clear and distinct\nconcepts, they nevertheless\nhave their ground in the unalterable nature of\nthings themselves; in the concordance of the manifold; in order and\nharmony. These laws, which are investigated, discovered, and confirmed\nthrough lengthy experience and much reflection, are unbreakable and\nfirm, even if someone who judges in accordance with his taste\nsometimes gives preference to those works which more or less violate\nthem. (Schriften, pp.  62\u20133)\n\n\nIn Gottsched\u2019s view, judgments of taste, even if\n they are not made on the basis of explicit knowledge of objective\n rules about the perfection of things, track those objective rules\n when they are in fact correct. Experts in the relevant art can make\n those rules explicit. The \u201ctouchstone\u201d for judgments of\n taste\nis thus found in the rules for perfection that are\nsuitable for every particular kind of beautiful things, whether\nbuildings, paintings, music, etc., and which can be distinctly\nconceived and demonstrated by genuine masters\nthereof. (Schriften, pp. 64\u20135)\n\n\nThus judgments of taste are not to be attributed\nto \u201cwit, nor to imagination, nor to memory,\u201d nor to any\n\u201csixth sense,\u201d but to \u201cunderstanding,\u201d\nalthough not to \u201creason\u201d (Schriften,\npp. 63\u20134)), since these judgments track the rules that the\nexperts know but are not explicitly derived from those rules.\n\n\nAnd what are the rules in accordance with which judgments of taste are\ntacitly made? The most general rule is simply that art should imitate\nnature, so that in order to be beautiful art must imitate what is\nbeautiful in nature. Poets in particular must give truthful but lively\ndescriptions of \u201cnatural things,\u201d and in the case of\npoetry destined for the theater they must give their characters\n\u201csuch words, gestures, and actions\u201d as are\n\u201cappropriate to their circumstances\u201d (Schriften,\np. 81). Gottsched does not interpret this rule to mean that poets can\ndescribe only the actual actions and feelings of actual people; of\ncourse poetry can present fables as well as history. But for Gottsched\na fable is\nan occurrence that is possible in certain\ncircumstances although it has not actually taken place, in which a\nuseful moral truth lies hidden. Philosophically one could say that it\nis a piece of another possible world (Schriften, p. 86)\n\n\nInsofar as it does not recount an actual event a\n fable is \u201cprobable\u201d rather than \u201ctrue.\u201d But\n for Gottsched probability depends upon the consistency of the\n fictional event with the actual laws of nature, in particular the\n laws of human nature, even though the circumstances of the fictional\n world differ in some regard from those of the actual world. In this\n regard even the fable must still be an imitation of nature with all\n its perfections. Of course Gottsched\u2019s rider that the fable must\n contain a hidden moral truth means that it must also be consistent\n with the real rules of moral perfection, and indeed that the point of\n poetic indulgence in fable or fiction is precisely to make a moral\n truth alive and forceful to us by showing that it holds even in a\n possible world that differs from the actual world in certain of its\n facts but not in its principles.\n2.2 Bodmer and Breitinger\n\nGottsched\u2019s work became the subject of a \u201cwar of the\npoets\u201d with the Swiss writers Johann Jacob Bodmer and Johann\nJacob Breitinger. Bodmer (1698\u20131783) taught Swiss history in\nZ\u00fcrich for forty years, advocated the works of Dante and\nShakespeare, and translated Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost into\nGerman prose. Breitinger (1701\u201376) taught Greek, Hebrew, logic,\nand rhetoric, and edited the works of the German Baroque poet Martin\nOpitz. Together, they edited Die Discourse der Mahlern\n(\u201cThe Discourse of the Painters\u201d), Switzerland\u2019s first\n\u201cmoral weekly\u201d based on the model of The\nSpectator, from 1721\u201323. These essays did not concern\npainting at all or even general issues about the arts very\nmuch\u2014the name merely reflects their use of the names of famous\npainters as pseudonymous signatures for their articles\u2014although\none of Bodmer\u2019s articles on Opitz celebrated the imagination as the\nkey to poetic success: \u201cA writer such as our Opitz who has\nenriched and filled the imagination with images of things can write\npoetry that is lively and natural\u201d and by \u201cthe strength of\nhis imagination bring back all the ideas that he had when he was\nreally in love, empathetic, depressed, or enraged\u201d (Die\nDiscourse der Mahlern, Erster Theil, XIX Discourse, cited\nfrom Dichtungstheorien der Aufkl\u00e4rung, p. 13).\n\n\nThe emphasis on the imagination seems to have been the central issue\nin Bodmer and Breitinger\u2019s dispute with Gottsched, which came to a\nhead in Breitinger\u2019s own Critische Dichtkunst, published in\n1740 with a forward by Bodmer.  Because they shared with Gottsched the\ngeneral assumption that art is based on the imitation of nature and\nhas the goal of making important moral truths come alive for us, it is\nhard to see exactly what divided the two sides in this dispute, but\nthe key seems to lie in their conception of poetic fables. As we saw,\nGottsched believed that a poetic fable describes events in a possible\nrather than in the actual world, but he insists that the laws of\nnature and human nature must remain constant: thus a poetic fable can\ndepict a hero who never existed, and make some moral truth alive to us\nthrough its depiction of this possible rather than actual hero, but\neverything about this hero and his world should still be\nnatural. Bodmer and Breitinger, however, as advocates of Shakespeare\nand Milton, believed that important moral truths could be made alive\nto us through works of the poetic imagination that depart more\ndrastically from actual nature and history. They held that novelty is\nan especially powerful source of aesthetic pleasure and thus an\nespecially powerful means of making moral truths come alive, and for\nthis reason they concluded that \u201csince the most ancient\ntimes\u201d the fable has been the means \u201cfor bringing the most\nuseful but at the same time best known moral truths home to us in a\npleasing way\u201d (Breitinger, Critische Dichtkunst, cited\nfrom Dichtungstheorien der Aufkl\u00e4rung, p. 42). Their idea is\nthat the more imaginative inventions of the poets\u2014the Satan of\nMilton or the Caliban of Shakespeare rather than the more human heroes\nof Racine and Corneille admired by Gottsched\u2014make moral truths\nappear more alive precisely by their attention-grabbing departure from\nthe familiar creatures of the real world. Thus Bodmer and Breitinger\nthought that the moralistic aim of poetry that they accepted in common\nwith Gottsched could be better achieved by a freer use of the\nimagination in poetry than Gottsched was prepared to allow. They\nagreed in their philosophical analysis of the ends of art but\ndisagreed in their empirical assessment of its most effective\nmeans.\n\n\nBy their advocacy of Milton and Shakespeare, the most imaginative\npoets of the preceding century, Bodmer and Breitinger prepared the way\nfor subsequent artistic movements that emphasized the freedom of the\nimagination, even while they continued to work within the conceptual\nframework of Wolffian perfectionism. The same is true for two\nprofessional philosophers of the time who also worked within the\nWolffian framework but took at least one step towards an aesthetic\ntheory that could subsequently give the play of the mental powers\nequal importance with the sensible representation of truth by treating\nthe aesthetic qualities of representations as parallel to rather than\nidentical with their purely cognitive qualities. So let us now turn to\nthe innovations of Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten and his disciple and\nally, Georg Friedrich Meier. Meier actually responded directly to\nGottsched in a number of polemics, but since his views were based\nlargely\u2014although not entirely\u2014on Baumgarten\u2019s, it will be\nbetter to treat them together than to treat Meier now.\n3. Baumgarten and Meier: Aesthetics as the Analogue of Rational Cognition\n\n\nAlexander Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714\u20131762), as previously\nmentioned, introduced the term \u201caesthetics\u201d in his 1735\nthesis Meditationes philosophicae de nonnullis ad poema\npertinentibus (\u201cPhilosophical meditations pertaining to\nsome matters concerning poetry\u201d). Baumgarten\u2019s new name for the\ndiscipline did not, however, signify a complete break with earlier\nphilosophical views, that is, with the perfectionist aesthetics of\nLeibniz and Wolff. By introducing the concept of \u201canalogue of\nreason\u201d Baumgarten did however make one key departure from the\nWolffian model that would eventually open the way for much more\nradical reconceptions of aesthetic experience in Germany; Baumgarten\nwould also introduce an emphasis on the emotional impact of art that\nis lacking in Wolff. But Baumgarten nevertheless remained more a Moses\nwho glimpsed the new theory from the shores of Wolffianism than a\nJoshua who conquered the new aesthetic territory.\n3.1 Baumgarten\n\nBaumgarten was the son of a Pietist minister from Berlin, but was\norphaned by the time he was eight. He followed his older brother Jacob\nSigismund (who would become a prominent theologian and historian of\nreligion) to Halle when he was thirteen. The Baumgartens thus arrived\nin Halle just after Wolff had been expelled and the study of his\nphilosophy banned, although the ban was less strictly enforced at the\nfamous Pietist orphanage and school in Halle (the Franckesche Stift)\nwhere they went first than at the university. The younger Baumgarten\nstarted at the university at sixteen (in 1730), and studied theology,\nphilology, poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy, especially Leibniz, whose\nphilosophy unlike that of Wolff had not been banned. He began teaching\nthere himself in 1735, upon the acceptance of his thesis on poetry,\nand published his Metaphysics in 1739. In 1740, the same year\nas he published his Ethics, he was called to a\nprofessorship\u2014or more precisely, ordered to accept it\u2014at\nanother Prussian university, in Frankfurt an der Oder. Georg Friedrich\nMeier (1718\u20131777), who had been studying with Baumgarten, took\nover his classes and was himself appointed professor at Halle in\n1746.\n\n\nHaving published the textbooks for his metaphysics and ethics classes\n(which Kant would still use decades later), Baumgarten then returned\nto aesthetics, and began working on a major treatise in 1742. The\nfirst volume of his Aesthetica appeared in 1750. It was\nwritten in Latin, like Baumgarten\u2019s other works, and was the first\nwork ever to use the name of the new discipline as a title. The next\nyear, however, Baumgarten\u2019s health began to decline, and a second\nvolume of the Aesthetica came out only in 1758, under\npressure from the publisher. The two volumes cover just under a third\nof Baumgarten\u2019s original plan, although they may have included the\nmost original part of the plan. Meanwhile, Meier had been publishing\nprofusely in Halle since the early 1740s, with works in or relevant to\naesthetics including a Theoretical Doctrine of the Emotions\nin 1744, a twenty-five part Evaluation of Gottsched\u2019s Poetics\ncollected in book form in 1747, a three-volume Foundations of the\nBeautiful Sciences from 1748\u20131750, and a condensation of\nthe latter, the Extract from the Foundations of the Beautiful Arts\nand Sciences in 1757. (Meier also published massive textbooks in\nlogic, metaphysics, and ethics, as well as a memoir of Baumgarten and\na German translation of Baumgarten\u2019s\nLatin Metaphysics). Although Meier thus published his main\ntreatise in aesthetics before Baumgarten did, he claimed it was based\non Baumgarten\u2019s lectures, and always presented himself as a disciple\nof Baumgarten.\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s Meditations on Poetry conclude with his famous\nintroduction of the term \u201caesthetics\u201d: \u201cThe Greek\nphilosophers and the Church fathers have always carefully\ndistinguished between the aistheta and the noeta,\u201d that is,\nbetween objects of sense and objects of thought, and while the latter,\nthat is, \u201cwhat can be cognized through the higher faculty\u201d\nof mind, are \u201cthe object of logic, the aistheta are the subject\nof the episteme aisthetike or AESTHETICS,\u201d the science of\nperception (Meditationes, \u00a7CXVI, p. 86).  But this work\nsays nothing about in what way the new discipline might be a general\nscience of perception, and analyzes only the nature of poetry and our\nexperience of it. We will first see what is novel in Baumgarten\u2019s\ntheory of poetry, and then turn to his larger work to see what it\nsuggests about the general character of the new discipline. Baumgarten\nbegins the work with a series of definitions, defining\n\u201cdiscourse\u201d as a \u201cseries of words that bring to mind\n[intelligimus] connected representations,\u201d\n\u201csensible representations\u201d as ones \u201creceived through\nthe lower part of the cognitive faculty,\u201d \u201csensible\ndiscourse\u201d as a \u201cdiscourse of sensible\nrepresentations,\u201d and finally a \u201cpoem\u201d as a\n\u201cperfect sensible discourse.\u201d The parts of sensible\ndiscourse are \u201c(1) sensible representations, (2) their\ninterconnections, and (3) the words, or the articulate sounds which\nare represented by the letters and which symbolize the words,\u201d\nand sensible discourse is \u201cdirected toward the apprehension of\nsensible discourse\u201d (Meditationes,\n\u00a7\u00a7I\u2013IX, pp.  6\u201310). The key thoughts in this\nseries of definitions is that poetry is aimed not just at conveying\ntruth, but at conveying it by means of \u201csensible\nrepresentations,\u201d or imagery drawn from the senses, and that the\n\u201cperfection\u201d of a poem may lie in both its medium, that\nis, the words its uses, and the imagery it arouses, and indeed in the\nrelationship between these two dimensions. Thus Baumgarten introduces\nthe idea that the sensible imagery a work of art arouses is not just a\nmedium, more or less perfect, for conveying truth, but a locus of\nperfection in its own right. This is a view that was barely hinted at\nby Wolff, and not at all in his discussion of imitation as the\nperfection of mimetic arts, but only in his discussion of mixed arts\nlike architecture, where he took into account the appearance as well\nas the function of structural elements.\n\n\nAs he continues Baumgarten remains within the Wolffian framework by\ndefining sensible representations as clear rather than\nobscure\u2014thus he rejects poetry that aims at obscurity for its\nown sake (Meditationes, \u00a7XIII, p. 14)\u2014but confused\nrather than distinct, and thus as conveying more representations\npacked together rather than fewer that are neatly separated. Or as he\nputs it, poems aim for extensive rather\nthan intensive clarity, conveying more rather than less\ninformation but without separating the images from each other, as\nwould be aimed for in scientific or \u201clogical\u201d discourse\n(Meditationes, \u00a7\u00a7XVI\u2013XVII, p. 16). And since\nindividuals are more fully determined, or more fully characterized,\nthan any abstraction, \u201cparticular representations are in the\nhighest degree poetic\u201d (Meditationes, \u00a7XIX,\np. 18): poetry achieves its goal of arousing a density of images by\nportraying individuals in particular circumstances rather than by\ntrafficking in generalities and abstractions. Thus Baumgarten turns\nwhat is a vice in scientific knowledge\u2014connoting too many ideas\nwithout clearly distinguishing among them\u2014into the paradigm\nvirtue of poetry.\n\n\nWhat is particularly striking is that he then uses what we might call\nthis quantitative conception of the aim of poetry, that it arouse more\nand denser rather than fewer and more clearly separated images, as the\nbasis for an argument that poetry should be emotionally\naffecting. First he argues that poetry aims to arouse our affects or\nengage our emotions simply because they are sensible:\nSince affects are more notable degrees of pain and\npleasure, their sensible representations are given in representing\nsomething to oneself confusedly as good or bad, and thus they\ndetermine poetic representations, and to arouse affects is\npoetic. (Meditationes, \u00a7XXV, p. 24)\n\n\nBut then he goes on to give an explicitly\nquantitative argument for this conclusion:\n\n\nThe same can be demonstrated by this reasoning also: we represent more\nin those things which we represent as good and bad for us than if we\ndo not so represent them; therefore representations of things which\nare confusedly exhibited as good or bad for us are extensively clearer\nthan if they were not so displayed, hence they are more poetic.  Now\nsuch representations are motions of the affects, hence to arouse\naffects is poetic. (Meditationes, \u00a7XXVI, pp.\n24\u20136)\n\n\n\nBaumgarten thus innovates within the formal structure of Wolffian\nphilosophy in order to accommodate a non-cognitivist aspect of the\naims of art. Indeed, his emphasis on the poetic arousal of emotion has\nrecently been argued to be a subtle Pietist response to Wolffian\nintellectualism. This aspect of Baumgarten\u2019s early poetics clearly\nimpressed his student Meier, who devoted one of his earliest books to\na Theoretical Doctrine of the Emotions, or\n\u201cGem\u00fcthsbewegungen,\u201d literally,\n\u201cmovements of the mind.\u201d Meier states that\nAesthetics is in general the science of sensible\ncognition. This science concerns itself with everything that can be\nassigned in more detail to sensible cognition and to its\npresentation. Now since the passions have a strong influence on\nsensible cognition and its presentation, aesthetics for its part can\nrightly demand a theory of the emotions. (Meier, Theoretische\nLehre der Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, \u00a77, p. 7)\n\n\nHowever, since Baumgarten himself does not give\nas much emphasis to the emotional aspect of the experience of art in\nhis Aesthetica as his earlier Meditations might lead\nus to expect, perhaps because it remained incomplete, we will return\nto Meier\u2019s development of this theme only after we have considered\nBaumgarten\u2019s mature work.\n\n\nBefore we can turn to the Aesthetica, however, we must look\nat some of the key definitions Baumgarten lays down in the chapter on\n\u201cEmpirical Psychology\u201d in his Metaphysics.\nBaumgarten begins by defining the \u201cinferior\u201d or\n\u201clower faculty of cognition\u201d as that which works with\nsensible representations, which are in turn \u201cindistinct, that\nis, obscure or confused\u201d (Metaphysik,\n\u00a7\u00a7382\u20133, pp.  115\u201316). Sensible representations\ncan be developed in either of two ways, however: either with\nincreasing clarity of their component \u201cmarks,\u201d in which\ncase they acquire \u201cgreater clarity\u201d (claritas\nintensive maior), or with increasing \u201cmultitude of\nmarks,\u201d in which case they acquire \u201cliveliness\u201d\n(vividitas, claritas extensive maior, cogitationum nitor)\n(Nitor means brightness or splendor). The former development\nof cognition leads to proofs, while what makes a perception lively is\na \u201cpainterly\u201d form of clarity (eine malende),\nthus one that consists in richness of imagery rather than analytical\nclarity (Metaphysik, \u00a7393, p. 119). It is this\nliveliness rather than probative clarity which is the basis of\naesthetic experience.\n\n\nBaumgarten then defines judgment as the representation of the\nperfection or imperfection of things. Judgment is initially divided\ninto \u201cpractical\u201d judgment, the object of which is\n\u201cthings foreseen,\u201d and \u201ctheoretical judgment,\u201d\nwhich concerns everything else (Metaphysik, \u00a7451, p.\n139). Theoretical judgment is in turn divided into that which is\ndistinct and that which is rather sensible, and the \u201cability to\njudge sensibly is taste in the broad,\u201d that is,\naesthetic sense. So taste is the ability to judge perfections and\nimperfections sensibly rather than intellectually. Perfections and\nimperfections, it should be noted, are defined entirely formally as\nthe \u201cagreement or disagreement\u201d of the \u201cmanifold of\na thing\u201d (Metaphysik, \u00a7452, p. 139). Next,\nBaumgarten divides the sensible representation or judgment of\nperfections and imperfections into the \u201cintuitive\u201d and the\n\u201csymbolic,\u201d that is, those which consist in sensible\nproperties directly and those which consist in sensible properties\ntaken as symbols of something else, and then adds that the sensible\ncognition of a perfection is pleasing and that of its imperfection\ndispleasing. If I have sensible cognition neither of an object\u2019s\nperfection nor its imperfection, then it is indifferent to me\n(Metaphysik, \u00a7478, p. 150). Finally, Baumgarten states\nthat beauty is perfection perceived by means of the senses rather than\nby the pure intellect (Metaphysik, \u00a7488,\npp. 154\u20135).\n\n\nThus far, then, Baumgarten has remained within the conceptual\nframework of Wolff. One key addition to Wolff that he makes in\nthe Metaphysics, however, is the concept of the analogon\nrationis, the \u201canalogue of reason.\u201d He writes:\n\n\nI cognize the interconnection of some things distinctly, and of others\nindistinctly, consequently I have the faculty for both.  Consequently\nI have an understanding, for insight into the connections of things,\nthat is, reason (ratio); and a faculty for\nindistinct insight into the connections of things, which consists of\nthe following: 1) the sensible faculty for insight into the\nconcordances among things, thus sensible wit; 2) the sensible faculty\nfor cognizing the differences among things, thus sensible acumen; 3)\nsensible memory; 4) the faculty of invention; 5) the faculty of\nsensible judgment and taste together with the judgment of the senses;\n6) the expectation of similar cases; and 7) the faculty of sensible\ndesignation. All of these lower faculties of cognition, in so far as\nthey represent the connections among things, and in this respect are\nsimilar to reason, comprise that which is similar to reason\n(analogon rationis), or the sum of all the cognitive\nfaculties that represent the connections among things\nindistinctly. (Metaphysik, \u00a7468,\np. 146)\n\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s departure from Wolff here may be subtle, but his idea is\nthat the use of a broad range of our mental capacities for dealing\nwith sensory representations and imagery is not an inferior and\nprovisional substitute for reason and its logical and\nscientific analysis, but something parallel to reason.\nMoreover, this complex of human mental powers is productive of\npleasure, through the sensible representation of perfection, in its\nown right.  Baumgarten has not yet introduced the idea that aesthetic\npleasure comes from the free play of our mental powers, but he has\nrelaxed the grip of the assumption that aesthetic response is a\nstraightforward case of cognition.\n\n\nThe potential of this idea finally begins to emerge in\nthe Aesthetica. Taking up where the Meditations had\nleft off, Baumgarten begins the \u201cProlegomena\u201d of this work\nwith his famous definition of aesthetics:\nAesthetics (the theory of the liberal arts, the\nlogic of the lower capacities of cognition [gnoseologia\ninferior], the art of thinking beautifully, the art of\nthe analogon rationis) is the science of sensible\ncognition. (Aesthetica, \u00a71)\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s list of synonyms may be confusing,\nfor it includes both traditional and novel designations of his\nsubject matter. He explains in the preface to the second edition of\nthe Metaphysics that he\nadds synonymous designations from other authors in\nparentheses alongside [his own] defining expressions so that the\nlatter might more easily be understood. (Vorreden zur\nMetaphysik, p. 43)\n\n\nYet it is clear that he means his own new science\nto be broader in scope than some of the more traditional definitions\nhe brackets: he intends to provide a general science of\nsensible cognition rather than just a theory of the fine arts\nor our taste for them.  Although Baumgarten makes some broad claims\nfor the new science, this is not where the novelty of\nthe Aesthetica lies, for at least in the extant part of the\nwork Baumgarten never actually develops this theme. Instead, the\ninnovation comes at the beginning of the first chapter of the work,\nwhen Baumgarten writes that\nThe aim of aesthetics is the perfection of\nsensible cognition as such, that is, beauty, while its imperfection as\nsuch, that is, ugliness, is to be avoided. (Aesthetica,\n\u00a714)\n\n\n\nBaumgarten\u2019s departure from Wolff\u2019s formula that beauty is the\nsensitive cognition of perfection may easily be overlooked, but in his\ntransformation of that into his own formula that beauty is the\nperfection of sensitive cognition he is saying that beauty lies\nnot\u2014or as his subsequent practice suggests, not just\u2014in\nthe representation of some objective perfection in a form accessible\nto our senses, but rather\u2014or also\u2014in the exploitation of\nthe specific possibilities of sensible representation for their own\nsake. In other words, there is potential for beauty in the form of a\nwork as well as in its content because its form can be pleasing to our\ncomplex capacity for sensible representation\u2014the analogon\nrationis\u2014just as its content can be pleasing to our\ntheoretical or practical reason itself. The satisfaction of those\nmental powers summed up in the analogon rationis is a source\nof pleasure in its own right.\n\n\nWhat does this mean in practice? Baumgarten\u2019s recognition of the\nperfection of sensible cognition as well as the perfection of what is\nrepresented as a distinct source of pleasure in beauty leads him to\nrecognize not just one but in fact three different potential sources\nof beauty in a work of art: \u201cthe harmony of the thoughts insofar\nas we abstract from their order and their signs,\u201d or means of\nexpression; \u201cthe harmony of the order in which we meditate upon\nthe beautifully thought content,\u201d and \u201cthe harmony of the\nsigns\u201d or means of expression \u201camong themselves and with\nthe content and the order of the content\u201d (Aesthetica,\n\u00a7\u00a718\u201320). Here Baumgarten is importing the traditional\nrhetorical concepts of inventio, dispositio\nand elocutio into his system, and conceiving of the latter\ntwo, the harmony of the thoughts and the harmony of the expression\nwith the thoughts, as the dimensions in which the potentials for\npleasure within our distinctively sensible manner of representing and\nthinking are realized. He thus recognizes those aspects of works of\nart, which were touched upon only in passing by Wolff and Gottsched,\nas sources of pleasure internal to works of art that are equally\nsignificant with the pleasure that arises from the content of works,\nconsidered as representations of perfections outside of the works\nthemselves. The three main sections of Baumgarten\u2019s planned project,\nthe \u201cheuristic,\u201d \u201cmethodology,\u201d and\n\u201csemiotics\u201d were intended to cover these three sources of\npleasure in works of art. (see Aesthetica, \u00a713).\n\n\nAs it happened, Baumgarten did not live to complete even the first of\nthese three parts. Further, the material he did complete suggests that\nhe may have been more successful in making conceptual space for the\nappreciation of the particularly sensible aspects of art than in\nsubstantively changing how art is actually experienced. What\nBaumgarten does is to take a list of the categories of the perfections\nof the content of logical or scientific cognition and construct a\nparallel list by adding the adjective \u201csensible\u201d to them\nto arrive at a list of sensible or aesthetic perfections (and Meier\nmakes a similar addition to lists of the perfections of the\norganization and expression of scientific knowledge). Nevertheless,\nsome of Baumgarten\u2019s categories of aesthetic qualities are\nimportant. The list of the perfections of every kind of cognition that\nBaumgarten gives in the first chapter of the Aesthetica is\n\u201cwealth, magnitude, truth, clarity, and liveliness\u201d\n(ubertas, magnitudo, veritas, claritas, \ncertitudo\net vita cognitionis), and thus beauty consists in the aesthetic\nversions of these perfections (Aesthetica,\n\u00a7\u00a722\u201325).\n\n\nHowever, in his classroom lectures on the Aesthetica,\nBaumgarten particularly emphasized the moral magnitude of the\nsubject matter of works of art as a major source of our pleasure in\nthem, and there mentions that works of art will therefore be touching,\nthat is to say, emotionally moving. Baumgarten stressed that the moral\ncontent of a work of art is only one source of beauty, and that a work\nof art can be beautiful without any moral grandeur.\n\u201c[A]esthetic dignity,\u201d he claimed, \u201cbelongs to\naesthetic magnitude as a part to the whole,\u201d but if a work of\nart represents moral agents then it cannot be maximally beautiful\nwithout representing moral dignity, and it certainly cannot be\nbeautiful if it conveys an attitude contrary to morality. What is\nimportant here, finally, is the moral standing of what is contained in\nthe work of art, not the actual morality of the artist himself.\n3.2 Meier\n\nBaumgarten did not extensively develop his comment that art must be\ntouching, but this became central to Meier\u2019s aesthetics. In his early\nwork on the emotions, Meier emphasized that aesthetics should deal\nwith the passions because they have a \u201cstrong influence on\nsensible cognition.\u201d His position is not just that the passions\nhave influence on sensible cognition, but that they are themselves a\ngreat source of sensible pleasure, and that it is therefore part of\nthe aim of art to arouse them. Meier analyzes the passions, in spite\nof their name (the German term Leidenschaft, like the\nLatin passio, etymologically means something that happens to\nsomeone rather than something that one does, an actio), as a\nform of mental activity: they are \u201cefforts or strivings of the\nsoul\u201d that result in a desire or an aversion, more precisely\nparticularly strong and firm desires or aversions\n(Meier, Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, \u00a727, p.  30). This might\nlead one to expect that desires and aversions can be sources of great\npleasure or displeasure, depending upon whether they are realized or\nnot, but Meier goes on to argue that \u201call emotions, the\ndisagreeable ones not excluded, produce a gratification,\u201d\nbecause they are active states or perfections of the soul, and\n\u201cwhenever the soul feels a perfection in itself, it is sensitive\nof a gratification.\u201d And because they are so strong, the\npassions, whether desires or aversions, are those among our mental\nstates that make us most aware of our own mental activity, and\ntherefore are actually the strongest source of pleasure for us:\nin the passions almost the entire lower power of\ncognition and desire is engaged, that is, almost the entire lower part\nof our soul. Thus in the emotions the soul is sensitive of the\nstrength of its powers, that is, of its perfection. It must therefore\nnecessarily be gratified with its own strength. It must be joyous when\nit feels as much as it can. (Gem\u00fcthsbewegungen, \u00a789,\np. 124)\n\n\nIn another essay Meier identifies this feeling of\njoy at the activity of our own soul with the category of the\n\u201clife of cognition,\u201d and thus makes it a central source\nof our pleasure in art.\nLiving cognition becomes alive through the\nsensible representations. The lower powers of the soul, the desires\nand aversions, constitute the life of a cognition. Everything that\nleaves our powers in peace when we cognize it is a dead\ncognition. (Meier, \u201cDa\u00df das Wesen der Dichtkunst in unserer\nNatur gegr\u00fcndet ist\u201d (\u201cThat the essence of poetry is\ngrounded in our nature\u201d), in Meier, Fr\u00fche Schriften,\nPart 3, pp. 160\u20134, at p. 162)\n\n\nArt aims for the opposite. Indeed, Meier\ncontinues that it is by arousing our passions that art achieves its\ngoal of a clear but confused, that is, manifold but densely packed,\ncognition. For Meier, moving our emotions is not just some small part\nof the beauty of art, as Baumgarten seems to suggest. Instead, the\narousal of our emotions, even ones that considered by themselves\nshould be disagreeable, is the strongest source of the pleasure at\nwhich art aims because it is the most intense form of mental\nactivity.\n\n\nMeier thus departed from the strictly cognitivist aesthetics of Wolff\nand connected what he had learned from Baumgarten with the passionate\naesthetics of the French Abb\u00e9 Du Bos. With his connection of the\npleasure in experiencing emotions to the pleasure of experiencing\nmental activity as such he brought Wolffian aesthetics a step closer\nto contemporary British aesthetics. Meier thereby prepared the way for\nthe tremendous influence that British aesthetics would have in Germany\nby the end of the 1750s. But while Meier stressed\nthe activity of the mind and Baumgarten argued that aesthetic\nexperience is based in an analogue of reason, not reason itself,\nneither was quite ready to introduce the idea of the free\nplay of our mental powers as the fundamental source of our\npleasure in aesthetic experience. Baumgarten mentions play once, but\nonly to recommend that children be allowed to play in order to develop\ntheir cognitive powers, not as the fundamental source of mature\naesthetic pleasure (Poppe, \u00a755, p. 102). Baumgarten also at least\nonce characterizes the mental state of aesthetic experience as a form\nof harmony: he says that the \u201caestheticodogmatic\u201d thinker\n(by which he means a thinker aiming to express a true doctrine\naesthetically )\nshould in his striving for truth put that before\nthe eyes of his audience the truth of which he has known with\ncertitude and which can be represented in its aesthetic truth on the\nbasis of the harmony between the upper and lower faculties of\ncognition. ( Aesthetica, \u00a7573; Schweizer, pp.\n254\u20135)\n\n\nBut the occurrence of this comment in the context\nof Baumgarten\u2019s discussion of aesthetic truth (or of how truths can\nbe presented in ways agreeable to the senses) makes clear that with\nthis reference to \u201charmony\u201d between the lower and upper\nfaculties of cognition he is not quite introducing the idea of\na free play between them. That idea would be decisively\nintroduced into German aesthetics only with Kant\u2019s unique synthesis\nof the preceding German tradition with the British tradition. Before\nthat was to happen, however, the ideas, emphasized more by Meier\nalthough already suggested by Baumgarten, that art aims at arousing\nour emotions and at the pleasurable activity of the mind, and at the\nformer as an instance of the latter, would be further developed by an\nintervening generation of German thinkers. Let us now turn to some of\nthose.\n4. Mendelssohn, Winckelmann, and Lessing: Mixed Emotions\n4.1 Mendelssohn\n\n In a review of Meier\u2019s 1757 Extract from the Foundations of all\n fine Arts and Sciences, Moses Mendelssohn (1729\u201386)\n rejected what he took to be the excessively abstract and a\n priori method of Baumgarten and Meier, writing that:\n\n\nJust as little as the philosopher can discover the appearances of\nnature, without examples from experience, merely through a\npriori inferences, so little can he establish appearances in the\nbeautiful world, if one can thus express oneself, without diligent\nobservations. The securest path of all, just as in the theory of\nnature, is this: One must assume certain experiences, explain their\nground through an hypothesis, then test this hypothesis against\nexperiences from a quite different species, and only assume those\nhypotheses to be general principles which have thus held their ground;\none must finally seek to explain these principles in the theory of\nnature through the nature of bodies and motion, but\nin aesthetics through the nature of the lower powers of our\nsoul.  (Review of Meier, pp. 197\u20138)\n\n\n\nYet the reference to the \u201clower powers of the soul\u201d in the\nfinal line of the quotation suggests that Mendelssohn will continue to\nwork within the general paradigm of Wolffian philosophy himself. He\ncertainly does, but what he aims to do is to show that the perfections\nthat can be realized in aesthetic experience are both more positive\nand more complicated than those recognized by\nBaumgarten. Mendelssohn\u2019s method allows him to recognize that all of\nour aesthetic experiences draw on a range of mental and even physical\nresources, and that because of this many aesthetic experiences can be\nunderstood only as \u201cmixed\u201d rather than simple\nfeelings. Mendelssohn\u2019s analysis of the complexity of aesthetic\nexperience places more emphasis on the powers of mind and body\ninvolved in such experience than on the objective perfections that art\nmay represent or nature contain. His account further prepares the\nground for the full-blown theory of aesthetic experience as based in a\nplay of our powers that will subsequently be achieved by Kant and\nSchiller. But in his emphasis on the role of the body as well as the\nmind in aesthetic experience, Mendelssohn goes beyond his\nsuccessors.\n\n\nMendelssohn followed his rabbi from Dessau to Berlin at the age of\nfourteen. At twenty-one, he became a tutor in the home of a Jewish\nsilk manufacturer, at twenty-five his accountant, subsequently his\nmanager, and finally a partner in the business, in which he would work\nfull-time for the rest of his life. But by twenty-five Mendelssohn had\nalso mastered not only literary German but Greek, Latin, French, and\nEnglish as well as a vast range of literature and philosophy in all\nthose languages. He had also become friends with the critic and\nplaywright Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and the writer and publisher\nFriedrich Nicolai, and begun an active publishing career. In 1755,\nbefore he turned twenty-six, Mendelssohn published Philosophical\nDialogues on the model of Shaftesbury, the epistolary On Sentiments,\nand, with Lessing, Pope, a Metaphysician! The next year he\npublished Thoughts on Probability and a translation of\nRousseau\u2019s second discourse On the Origins of\nInequality. From 1756 to 1759 he collaborated with Lessing and\nNicolai on the Library of Fine Sciences and Liberal Arts, for\nwhich he wrote two dozen reviews of new works in aesthetics and\nliterature, and from 1759 to 1765 he contributed nearly one hundred\nreviews to Nicolai\u2019s Letters concerning the newest\nLiterature, discussing works not only in aesthetics and\nliterature but also metaphysics, mathematics, natural science, and\npolitics (Gesammelte Schriften, vol. 5.1 (1991),\npp. 5\u2013676). In 1761 he published the first edition of\nhis Philosophical Writings, mostly on aesthetics, and in 1763\nhe took first place in a Prussian Academy of Sciences essay\ncompetition for an essay on Evidence in Metaphysical\nSciences, beating out the entry by Kant. But as a Jew, he was\ndenied entrance to the Academy by the \u201cenlightened\u201d\nFrederick the Great, even though he had the strong support of its\nmembers. In 1767, Mendelssohn published Phaedo: or on the\nImmortality of the Soul, loosely based on Plato\u2019s dialogue of the\nsame name, an immensely popular work. In the 1770s, after the onset of\na \u201cnervous debility\u201d that he would henceforth claim\nprevented him from serious philosophical work, Mendelssohn began a\ntranslation of the Pentatuech and Psalms into modern German (but\nprinted in Hebrew characters) that he hoped would preserve the Jewish\nreligion while simultaneously facilitating the assimilation of Jews\ninto German culture and society. His masterpiece Jerusalem, or on\nReligious Power and Judaism, in which he argued for the civil\nrights of the Jews by arguing that the state had no right to recognize\nany religion at all and therefore must allow all religions freedom\nfrom interference, was published in 1783. In 1785, he returned to\nphilosophy one last time with Morning Lessons, a magisterial\nsummary of his own version of Wolffianism. By this time, however, he\nwas caught up in a strenuous controversy with the fideist philosopher\nFriedrich Heinrich Jacobi over whether his lifelong friend Lessing had\nbeen a Spinozist. In the midst of this controversy he died of\nin January, 1786, at the age of fifty-six.\n\n\nMendelssohn worked within the framework of Wolffian metaphysics and\npsychology, and thus he accepted the definition of sensible perception\nas clear but confused cognition. He accepted Wolff\u2019s explanation that\npleasure arises in the sensible perception of perfection, but also\nBaumgarten\u2019s transformation of that formula into the explanation of\nbeauty as the perfection of sensible cognition: in Mendelssohn\u2019s\nterms, \u201cthe essence of the fine arts and sciences consists in an\nartful, sensibly perfect representation or in a sensible perfection\nrepresented by art\u201d (\u201cOn the Main Principles of the Fine\nArts and Sciences\u201d (1757), Philosophical Writings,\npp. 172\u20133). But Mendelssohn vigorously rejected any\ninterpretation of the Wolffian premise according to which the\nconfusion of sensible perception itself could be the source of our\npleasure in it. For Mendelssohn, any \u201cpure gratification of the\nsoul must be grounded in the positive powers of our soul and not in\nits incapacity, not in the limitation of those original powers\u201d\n(On Sentiments, Fourth Letter; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 19). Further, \u201cneither fully distinct nor\nfully obscure concepts are compatible with the feeling of\nbeauty\u201d: beauty requires that an object offer enough\n\u201cextensive clarity,\u201d that is, richness and variety, to\nstimulate us, but enough unity so that we can easily take it in as a\nwhole (On Sentiments, Third Letter, Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 14\u201315). Mendelssohn\u2019s explicit thesis is that\nwhile the parts of an object must be distinct enough to allow one to\nhave a sense of their variety but dense enough to allow one to grasp\nthem together with equilibrium and proportion, it is the latter that\nis the source of our pleasure.  It might seem a stretch to read him as\nalso suggesting that it is the play of the mind back and forth between\nits perception of the parts and its grasp of the whole that is\npleasant.  But he will argue that the exercise of various of our\npowers, indeed as we are about to see bodily as well as mental powers,\nis itself a perfection that we enjoy, so this might at least point\ntoward the idea that the source of pleasure in beauty is the free play\nof the those powers.\n\n\nWhile rejecting any interpretation of obscurity or confusion as itself\nthe source of our pleasure in beauty (On Sentiments, note\nh; Philosophical Writings, p. 79), Mendelssohn also rejects\nthe idea of the Abb\u00e9 Du Bos (and of Meier\u2019s theory of the emotions)\nthat the mere arousal of feelings as such is the aim of art\n(On Sentiments, Conclusion; Philosophical Writings,\np. 71), as well as the idea of Charles Batteux that \u201cthe\nimitation of nature is the general means by which the fine arts please\nus, and [that] it is possible to derive all particular rules of the\nfine arts and sciences from this single principle\u201d (\u201cOn\nthe Main Principles of the Fine Arts and\nSciences\u201d, Philosophical Writings, p. 170). Yet\nMendelssohn no more rejects the idea that works of art do arouse our\nemotions and that they are, at least in many cases, imitations of\nnature than he rejects the idea that the perception of perfection and\nthe perfection of perception is central to our experience of beauty\nand other aesthetic properties. So how does he fit all of these ideas\ntogether into his own distinctive theory?\n\n\nMendelssohn never presented his aesthetic theory in a full-length\ntreatise. His most systematic presentation, the 1757 essay \u201cOn\nthe Main Principles of the Fine Arts and Sciences,\u201d discusses\nonly three out of the four axes of potential perfection that he finds\nin the complete aesthetic experience. We therefore need to supplement\nwhat we can glean from this essay with suggestions from On\nSentiments and the Rhapsody, or addition to the Letters on\nSentiments that he added to his 1761 collection. The four axes\nthat Mendelssohn identifies are the perfection in the object of the\naesthetic experience, typically the perfection of what is depicted by\na work of art but not always, since some arts, such as music and\narchitecture, and all of nature are not mimetic at all; the perfection\nof our own perceptual capacities in the experience of an object, the\n\u201cperfection of sensible cognition\u201d that he adopted from\nBaumgarten; the perfection of our bodily condition that can\nbe produced through the effect of our mental condition on our body, a\ndimension lacking from all previous accounts in the German rationalist\ntradition but perhaps inspired by Mendelssohn\u2019s acquaintance with\nEdmund Burke\u2019s account of the physiology of our feelings of the\nbeautiful and the sublime (itself perhaps building upon the common\nproperty of David Hartley\u2019s 1749 Observations on Man); and\nfinally, the perfection of the artistry that has gone into the\nproduction of an object, whether human artistry in the case of a work\nof art or divine artistry in the case of the beauties of\nnature. Perfection along any of these axes is a potential source of\npleasure in the experience of an object, and the effect of these\nsources of pleasure can be additive, each increasing our pleasure in\nthe same object. But these multiple dimensions to our pleasure in\nobjects also create the possibility of the \u201cmixed\nemotions\u201d that we experience in the artistic representation of\nunpleasant or tragic objects, because in those cases our pleasure in\nthe mental activity stimulated by the work of art, the pleasant effect\nof that on the body, and our admiration of the artistry that has gone\ninto the object can outweigh any pain associated with the depicted\ncontent of the work.\n\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s characterization of the intrinsic perfection of objects\nin nature and thus of the objects depicted in representational art\nfollows in the path already marked out by Wolff: the perfection of an\nobject lies in the order, symmetry, and rational coherence of its\nparts, and its beauty lies in that perfection insofar as it can be\ngrasped in sensible cognition. Thus in On Sentiments\nMendelssohn writes that we call the structure of\nthe world beautiful in the proper sense of the term when the\nimagination orders its chief parts in as splendid a symmetry as that\nof the order that reason and perception teach us that they possess\noutside us. (On Sentiments, Third Letter; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 15)\n\n\nIn the case of natural objects, this order is\ncomprised by both the internal organization of an object to suit its\noverall goal and the part that the particular object plays in nature\nas a whole. In the \u201cMain Principles,\u201d Mendelssohn goes\nbeyond this formalistic characterization of perfection and offers a\nmore concrete list of the kinds of things that count as perfections\nin objects, whether objects in nature enjoyed in their own right or\nobjects in nature enjoyed through the artistic depiction of them,\nwhich provide \u201cthe first level of satisfaction and\ndissatisfaction which alternately accompany all our\nrepresentations.\u201d Here he says that\n\n\nEverything capable of being represented to the senses as a perfection\ncould also present an object of beauty. Belonging here are all the\nperfections of external forms, that is, the lines, surfaces, and\nbodies and their movements and changes; the harmony of the multiple\nsounds and colors; the order in the parts of a whole, their\nsimilarity, variety, and harmony; their transposition and\ntransformation into other forms; all the capabilities of our soul, all\nthe skills of our body. Even the perfections of our external state\n(under which honor, comfort, and riches are to be understood) cannot\nbe excepted from this if they are fit to be represented in a way that\nis apparent to the senses. (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d: Philosophical Writings,\np. 172)\n\n\n\nWhen Mendelssohn refers to the capabilities of our soul and the skills\nof our body here, he is referring to them as objects for depiction or\ndescription in a work of art, thus as part of the content of works of\nart. This is how he fits into his model the representation of human\nintentions, actions, and responses to them, which are the subject\nmatter of most mimetic art.\n\n\nThe next axis of perfection that Mendelssohn considers is the state of\nour mind in response to perfection or imperfection in a real or\nrepresented object. His clearest treatment of this may come in\nthe Rhapsody, which begins by taking up the question of how\nwe can be \u201cpowerfully attracted to the representation\u201d of\nsomething unpleasant. Mendelssohn answers this question this by saying\nthat\n\n\nEach individual representation stands in a twofold relation.  It is\nrelated, at once, to the matter before it as its object (of which it\nis a picture or copy) and then to the soul or the thinking subject (of\nwhich it constitutes a determination). As a determination of the soul,\nmany a representation can have something pleasant about it although,\nas a picture of the object, it is accompanied by disapproval and a\nfeeling of repugnance. (Rhapsody; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 132)\n\n\n\nSeveral points about this passage need comment. First, while by\n\u201crepresentation\u201d (Vorstellung) here Mendelssohn\nmeans a mental state that represents something other than itself and\nnot an external object such as a painting or a poem that depicts or\ndescribes something, a mental representation can of course indirectly\nrepresent an external object that is not directly present to it but is\nindirectly presented to it by an external representation such as a\npainting or a poem which is its direct external object, and that is\nindeed how artistic representation typically works. Second, while\nMendelssohn here refers to a mental representation as a\n\u201cdetermination\u201d (Bestimmung) or property of the\nmind, his further discussion suggests that he is actually thinking of\nrepresentation as a kind of mental activity, an activity\ninvolving our capacities for both knowing and desiring, and that we\nenjoy representation because we enjoy mental activity. Thus he\ncontinues that while \u201celements of perfection\u201d in a thing\nare \u201csatisfying and comfortable to us\u201d while\n\u201celements of imperfection\u2026are perceived with\ndissatisfaction,\u201d\n\n\nIn relation to the thinking subject, the soul, on the other hand,\nperceiving and cognizing the features as well as testifying to\nenjoying them or not constitutes something actual\n[Sachliches] that is posited in the soul, an affirmative\ndetermination of the soul. Hence every representation, at least in\nrelation to the subject, as an affirmative predicate of the thinking\nentity, must have something about it that we like. For even the\npicture of the deficiency of the object, just like the expression of\ndiscontent with it, are not deficiencies on the part of the thinking\nentity, but rather affirmative and actual determinations of\nit\u2026.considered as a representation, a picture within us that\nengages the soul\u2019s capacities of knowing and desiring, the\nrepresentation of what is evil is itself an element of the soul\u2019s\nperfection and brings with it something quite pleasant that we by no\nmeans would prefer not to feel than to\nfeel. (Rhapsody; Philosophical Writings, pp.\n133\u20134)\n\n\n\nIt is striking how Mendelssohn writes here in gerundives and\ninfinitives rather than in substantives in order to convey a sense of\nmental activity: recognizing and approving or\neven disapproving are actions of the mind\nin knowing and desiring. We enjoy that mental\nactivity, even when it is stimulated by the representation of\nsomething of which we disapprove, and we enjoy the representation even\nof something evil as long as our pleasure in the activity of\nrepresenting is not overwhelmed by disapproval of the object of the\nrepresentation.\n\n\nThe contrast between perfection or imperfection in the content of a\nrepresentation and the enjoyable activity of the mind in representing\nthat content is the heart of Mendelssohn\u2019s theory, so we can interrupt\nour catalogue of all four of the axes of perfection that he recognizes\nfor some comments on this contrast. The first thing to be noticed is\nthat Mendelssohn here emphasizes the engagement of our powers of both\nknowing and desiring in aesthetic experience, not merely the power of\nknowing. This gives him room to add an emphasis on our enjoyment of\nthe arousal of our emotions to Baumgarten\u2019s emphasis on our enjoyment\nof the perfection of sensible cognition. Now, as we saw, Baumgarten in\nfact made room for this dimension of aesthetic experience in his\nearly Meditations on Poetry, even though he did not take it\nup again in the Aesthetica, and Meier emphasized it in\nseveral of his works. But Mendelssohn adds a crucial point here,\nleading to a fundamental revision in the significance of artistic\nimitation: in order for us to enjoy the mixed emotions in a pleasing\nrepresentation of something that is objectively displeasing, our sense\nof the difference between the represented content and our act\nof representing it cannot be allowed to collapse, and the r\u00f4le of\nartistic imitation is precisely to create enough distance\nbetween our representation and its object to allow us to enjoy the\nrepresentation rather than to collapse that space by creating\nthe illusion that we are in the actual presence of the\ndepicted object. Mendelssohn writes,\nIf the objects gets too close to us, if we regard\nit as a part of us or even as ourselves, the pleasant character of the\nrepresentation completely disappears, and the relation to the subject\nimmediately becomes an unpleasant relation to us since here subject\nand object collapse, as it were, into one\nanother. (Rhapsody; Philosophical Writings, p.  134)\n\n\nHe then says that a\nmeans of rendering the most terrifying events\npleasant to gentle minds is the imitation by art, on the stage, on the\ncanvas, and in marble, since an inner consciousness that we have an\nimitation and nothing genuine before our eyes moderates the strength\nof the objective disgust and, as it were, elevates the subjective side\nof the representation. (Rhapsody; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 138)\n\n\nThus, contrary to Wolff, Mendelssohn does not\nsuppose that what we enjoy in imitation is accuracy of representation\ntaken to the point of illusion, but rather the room for the experience\nof our own mental activity that the knowledge that the depicted object\nis only being imitated allows.\n\n\nIn fact, Mendelssohn\u2019s analysis of our mixed emotions in the\nexperience of tragedy is even more subtle than this, for a further\naspect of it is that our knowledge that we are experiencing\nrepresented rather than real people allows us to enjoy sympathy with\nthe perfections of the noble characters who are depicted rather than\npity at their weaknesses or at the fate that overcomes them. But\nrather than pursuing this, I want to make to make one further point\nabout Mendelssohn\u2019s general account of our enjoyment of the engagement\nof our powers of knowing and desiring. This explanation of a\nfundamental source of aesthetic pleasure as arising from the\nengagement of those two powers might seem to conflict with\nMendelssohn\u2019s influential ascription of aesthetic pleasure to\na third faculty, the \u201cfaculty of approval,\u201d\ndistinguished from both the \u201cfaculty of cognition\u201d and the\n\u201cfaculty of desire.\u201d Mendelssohn introduces this third\nfaculty in the Morning Lessons, a quarter-century after his\nearly writings on aesthetics. There he says that\n\n\nOne usually divides the faculties of the soul into the faculty of\ncognition and the faculty of desire, and assigns the sentiment of\npleasure and displeasure to the faculty of desire. But it seems to me\nthat between knowing and desiring lies the approving, the assent, the\nsatisfaction of the soul, which is actually quite remote from\ndesire. We contemplate the beauty of nature and of art, without the\nleast arousal of desire, with gratification and satisfaction.  It\nseems to be a particular mark of beauty that we contemplate it with\nquiet satisfaction; that it pleases, even if we do not possess it, and\nthat is remote from the urge to possess it. (Morgenstunden,\nLesson VII, p. 70)\n\n\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s introduction of a faculty of approval in 1785 may have\nbeen influential for Kant\u2019s elevation of judgment to a faculty on a\npar with understanding and reason, signaled in his letter of December\n25, 1787, to Karl Leonhard Reinhold, a decisive step in the genesis of\nthe third critique.  But as far as Mendelssohn is concerned, his\nexplanation of the faculty of approval shows that his basic theory has\nnot changed. By introducing this faculty, he wants to emphasize that\nthe experience of beauty or other aesthetic qualities is not actual\nknowledge, nor does it lead to specific desires and actions (except\nperhaps the desire to be able to continue contemplating an object\nalready found to have been beautiful). But what satisfies the faculty\nof approval is still the activity of the other mental powers. Thus\nMendelssohn writes, first with reference to the power of cognition but\nthen with reference to desire as well, that\nWe can consider the cognition of the soul in\ndifferent respects; either in so far as it is true or false, which I\ncall the material aspect in cognition; or in so far as arouses\npleasure or displeasure, has as its consequence the approval or\ndisapproval of the soul, and this can be called the formal aspect in\ncognition.\n\n\nAnd he explains the latter aspect precisely in\nterms of mental activity:\n\n\nEvery concept, in so far as it is merely thinkable, has something that\npleases the soul, that occupies its activity, and is thus cognized by\nit with satisfaction and approval\u2026.where the soul finds more\nsatisfaction in one concept than in another, more agreeable\noccupation, then can it prefer the former to the latter. In this\ncomparison and in the preference that we give to an object consists\nthe essence of the beautiful and the ugly, the good and the evil, the\nperfect and the imperfect. What we cognize as the best in this\ncomparison works on our faculty of desire and stimulates it, where it\nfinds no resistance, to activity. This is the side on which the\nfaculty of approval touches demand or desire. (Morgenstunden,\nLesson VII, pp. 72\u20133)\n\n\n\nOrdinarily, the faculty of cognition aims at truth, and the faculty of\ndesire aims at action. The faculty of approval, however, aims just for\nthe pleasing activity of the other two faculties without their usual\nresults. The faculty of approval should be distinguished from the\nfaculties of cognition and desire, since it does not aim at the same\nresults they do. But it is itself satisfied by creations that set\nthose faculties into an \u201cagreeable play.\u201d This is not a\nbreach with Mendelssohn\u2019s earlier doctrine, but an explanation of\nit. Mendelssohn\u2019s explicit introduction of the concept of play here,\nfinally, may be just as influential for the development of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics as is his insistence that the faculty of approval does not\nlead to actual knowledge or actual desire.\n\n\nIn the Morning Lessons Mendelssohn does not emphasize that\nthe free play of the mind has a pleasing effect on the body, but he\ndoes in his earlier writings, so let us now return to this third item\nin Mendelssohn\u2019s catalogue of the axes of perfection in aesthetic\nexperience. This is the effect of the activity of the mind in\naesthetic experience on the state of the body, a point that\nMendelssohn emphasizes in On Sentiments and\nthe Rhapsody although not in the essay on the \u201cMain\nPrinciples.\u201d Mendelssohn says that if\neach sensible rapture, each improved condition of\nthe state of our body, fills the soul with the sensible representation\nof a perfection, then every sensible representation must also, in\nturn, bring with it some well-being of the body\u2026And in this way\na pleasant emotion [Affekt] arises.\n\n\nHe distinguishes between a \u201csensible\nrapture\u201d (sinnliche Wollust) and an emotion because the\nformer begins in a part of a body, that is, with an actual external\nperception, while the latter \u201carises in the brain itself,\u201d\nbut in either case the feeling of the pleasure \u201carrange[s] the\nfibers of the brain into an appropriate tone, employing them without\nfatiguing them,\u201d and then \u201cThe brain communicates this\nharmonious tension to nerves of the other parts of the body and the\nbody becomes comfortable\u201d (On Sentiments, Twelfth\nLetter; Philosophical Writings, p. 53). In other words,\nalthough as a rationalist metaphysician Mendelssohn maintains the\nformal distinction between the mind and the body (the mind is simple\nand indivisible, while body is essentially divisible), as a\npsychologist and aesthetician he nevertheless sees them as in the most\nintimate interaction, with the perception of harmony by the body\ninfusing the mind with a pleasant sense of harmony that then further\nstimulates the harmonious condition of the body.\n\n\nFinally, the \u201cMain Principles\u201d introduce a fourth source\nof perfection and therefore pleasure in the aesthetic experience,\nnamely our appreciation of the artistry that is manifested in the\nproduction of a beautiful object. In explaining this source of\npleasure, Mendelssohn also makes another revision to the traditional\ntheory that it is resemblance alone that is the source of our pleasure\nin imitation, because resemblance is easily produced by means far less\ncomplex and admirable than all of the faculties that go into\nartistry\u2014a point that Plato had already made when he had\nSocrates argue that if it is mere imitation that the painter were\nafter, he could just go around with a mirror\n(Plato, Republic, Book X, 596d\u2013e):\n\n\nAll works of art are visible imprints of the artist\u2019s abilities which,\nso to speak, put his entire soul on display and make it known to\nus. This perfection of spirit arouses an uncommonly greater pleasure\nthan mere similarity, because it is more worthy and far more complex\nthan similarity. It is all the more worthy the more that the\nperfection of rational beings is elevated above the perfection of\nlifeless things, and also more complex because many abilities of the\nsoul and often diverse skills of the external limbs as well are\nrequired for a beautiful imitation. We find more to admire in a rose\nby Huysum than in the image that every river can reflect of\nthis queen of the flowers; and the most enchanting landscape in\na camera obscura does not charm us as much as it can through\nthe brush of a great landscape painter. (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d; Philosophical Writings,\np. 174)\n\n\n\nMendelssohn explicitly recognizes the physical skills as well as the\nmental powers of the artist as among the perfections that we\nindirectly admire in admiring the work of art; this is another example\nof his recognition of the close connection between mind and body in\nspite of their metaphysical distinction. He also stresses the\nsuperiority of artistic representation over the mere imitation of\nnature by observing that the artist can create \u201cideal\nbeauty\u201d by gathering\ntogether in a single viewpoint what nature has\ndiffusely strewn among various objects, forming for himself a whole from this\nand taking the trouble to represent it just as nature would have\nrepresented it if the beauty of this limited object had been its sole\npurpose. (\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 176)\n\n\n\nHowever, although human artistry may concentrate beauty more than\nnature does, that hardly means that artistic beauty is in all regards\nsuperior to natural beauty. Mendelssohn concludes the paragraph just\ncited by saying that \u201cthe most perfect, ideal beauty\u2026is\nto be encountered nowhere in nature other than in the whole and is\nperhaps never fully to be attained in the works of art.\u201d The beauty of nature as a whole exceeds the beauty of any work of\nart, and accordingly our admiration for the skill and genius of any\nhuman artist must be exceeded by our admiration for and pleasure in\nthe artistry that lies behind nature as a whole.\n\n\nMendelssohn concludes the essay on the \u201cMain Principles of the\nFine Arts and Sciences\u201d with a brief but pregnant division of\nthe arts. The basis of his division is a distinction between\n\u201cnatural\u201d and \u201carbitrary\u201d signs, which has\nprecedents in Du Bos, in Leibniz and Wolff, and beyond all of them in\nSt. Augustine. Signs are natural \u201cif the combination of the\nsubject matter signified is grounded in the very properties of what is\ndesignated,\u201d as smoke is a natural product of fire or \u201cThe\npassions are, by their very nature, connected with certain movements\nin our limbs as well as with certain sounds and gestures\u201d\n(\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical Writings, p.\n177). Signs are arbitrary that \u201cby their very nature have\nnothing in common with the designated subject matter, but have\nnevertheless been arbitrarily assumed as signs for it,\u201d such as\nthe \u201carticulated sounds of all languages, the letters, the\nhieroglyphic signs of the ancients, and some allegorical images\u201d\n(\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical Writings, pp.\n177\u20138). The arbitrary signs could also be called\nconventional. Mendelssohn\u2019s chief distinction is then between those\narts that convey their content by artificial signs, namely poetry and\nrhetoric, and those arts that employ natural signs, which convey both\nreference to content and the expression of feeling through natural\nsigns and do \u201cnot presuppose anything arbitrary in order to be\nunderstood,\u201d namely painting, sculpture, music, dance, and even\narchitecture insofar as it conveys any meaning and expression. In\nfact, Mendelssohn distinguishes between the fine arts and the\nbeautiful sciences, or between beaux arts and belles\nlettres, on this basis: the fine arts employ natural signs, and\nthe beautiful sciences or belles lettres employ arbitrary or\nconventional signs (\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 178\u20139). Among the belles lettres,\npoetry and rhetoric are distinguished by the fact that \u201cThe\nmain, ultimate purpose of poetry is to please by means of a sensibly\nperfect discourse, while that of rhetoric is to persuade by means of a\nsensibly perfect discourse.\u201d Mendelssohn does not explain why\nthe fact that poetry and rhetoric employ artificial rather than\nnatural signs entitles them to be called sciences rather than arts;\nperhaps what he has in mind is that since the meanings of arbitrary\nsigns can be codified, there is more room for precision in the\ninterpretation of poetry and rhetoric than there is in the various\nfine arts (with the exception of their allegorical or iconographical\naspects, which as Mendelssohn has suggested are more like arbitrary\nthan natural signs). In the case of rhetoric, moreover, there was a\nlong tradition going back to antiquity of formulating rules for how\npersuasion can be achieved, and perhaps this made it seem like more of\na science than an art to Mendelssohn.\n\n\nBe this as it may, the main point of Mendelssohn\u2019s distinction is that\nbecause its signs are arbitrary and can therefore be associated with\nany conceivable content, \u201cthe poet can express everything of\nwhich our soul can have a clear concept,\u201d while the arts that\nemploy natural signs are limited to the expression of those ideas and\nemotions the natural signs for which can be replicated in their\nspecific media; each of these arts \u201cmust content itself with\nthat portion of natural signs that it can express by means of the\nsenses,\u201d or more precisely by means of its particular way of\nengaging the senses. For example, \u201cMusic, the expression of\nwhich takes place by means of inarticulate sounds,\u201d although it\ncan express both the general ideas of harmony and all of the\nparticular \u201cinclinations and passions of the human soul which\ntend to make themselves known by means of sounds,\u201d cannot\npossibly indicate particular concepts of objects such as \u201cthe\nconcept of a rose, a poplar tree, and so on, just as it is impossible\nfor painting to represent a musical chord to us\u201d (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d; Philosophical Writings, pp. 178\u20139).\nA similar point would be made a century later by the music critic\nEduard Hanslick.\n\n\nMendelssohn next assumes that only hearing and sight can convey\nnatural signs, and then observes that\nthe natural signs that affect the sense of sight\ncan be represented either successively or alongside one another, that\nis to say, they can express beauty either through movement or through\nforms. (\u201cMain Principles\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 179)\n\n\nThe art of dance employs movements that naturally\nexpress human feelings and emotions, while the arts of painting and\nsculpture must \u201cexpress beauties that are alongside one\nanother\u201d through line, color, and shape. This leads Mendelssohn\nto the point that although works of music, dance, and for that matter\npoetry themselves take place through a succession of moments and can\nthereby convey a succession of movements, painting and sculpture can\nrepresent only a single moment in the history of their objects. The\npainter and sculptor must therefore\n\n\nchoose the instant that is most favorable to their purpose.  They must\nassemble the entire action into a single perspective and divide it up\nwith a great deal of understanding. In this instant everything must be\nrich in thoughts and so full of meaning that every accompanying\nconcept makes its own contribution to the required meaning. When we\nview such a painting [or sculpture] with due attention, our senses are\nall at once inspired, all the abilities of our soul suddenly\nenlivened, and the imagination can from the present infer the past and\nreliably anticipate the future. (\u201cMain\nPrinciples\u201d; Philosophical Writings,\npp. 180\u20131)\n\n\n\nMendelssohn\u2019s thesis that the visual arts must convey all of their\ncontent through their representation of an object at a single moment\nwhile other arts can represent movements and actions in, as we would\nsay, real time, would be used as a premise in a famous controversy\nbetween his friend Lessing and the renowned historian of ancient art\nJohann Joachim Winckelmann, to which we will turn in a moment. But\nbefore doing so, we must complete our survey of Mendelssohn\u2019s\naesthetics with a comment on his discussion of the sublime.\n\n\nMendelssohn was instrumental in introducing the topic of the sublime\ninto German aesthetics, publishing a lengthy review of Burke\u2019s book on\nthe beautiful and the sublime in 1758, just a year after it appeared\nin England (reprinted in Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften,\nvolume 4, pp. 216\u201336), as well as an essay \u201cOn the Sublime\nand Na\u00efve in the Fine Sciences\u201d in the same year. In the latter\nessay, Mendelssohn makes a number of points that will become central\nto the subsequent German discussion of the sublime, especially in\nKant. His premise, not surprisingly, is that \u201cThe sentiment\nproduced by the sublime is a composite one\u201d (\u201cOn the\nSublime and the Na\u00efve in the Fine Sciences\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, p. 195). For one thing, it may be produced by the\nperception or thought of an \u201cimmensity of extended\nmagnitude\u201d or of an \u201cimmensity of strength or unextended\nmagnitude\u201d (\u201cThe Sublime and\nNa\u00efve\u201d; Philosophical Writings, p. 194)\u2014by the\nsight, image, or thought of something vastly big or of something\nvastly powerful.\n This distinction anticipates Kant\u2019s subsequent\ndistinction between the \u201cmathematical\u201d and the\n\u201cdynamical\u201d sublime, and while it was not uncommon in\nBritish discussions of the sublime, Mendelssohn may have been Kant\u2019s\nsource for it. Mendelssohn then says that either immensity of size or\nimmensity of strength first \u201ccaptures our attention\u201d and\n\u201carouses a sweet shudder that rushes through every fiber of our\nbeing\u2026giving wings to the imagination to press further and\nfurther without stopping.\u201d \u201cAll these sentiments blend\ntogether in the soul,\u201d becoming \u201ca single phenomenon which\nwe call awe\u201d (loc. cit.).  But the feeling of awe at\nimmensity does not yet complete the complex experience of the sublime;\nfor that, there must also be an element of admiration at a\nperfection\u2014for remember that Mendelssohn\u2019s project is still to\nground all aesthetic experience on the underlying principle of\npleasure in perfection. So the immensity which inspires us with awe\nmust also be interpreted as a manifestation of perfection. Mendelssohn\nthen invokes the same distinction he employed in his discussion of\nartistry. The immensity which fills us with awe may be either a\nproduct of divine artistry, in which case\nthe properties of the Supreme Being which we\nrecognize in his works inspire the most ecstatic awe and admiration\nbecause they surpass everything that we can conceive as enormous,\nperfect, or sublime,\n\n\nor it can be due to human artistry. In that case\nwe may not find the represented object so extraordinary but feel with\npleasure how \u201cthe artist possesses the skill of elevating its\nproperties and showing them in an uncommon light,\u201d or\nalternatively we may be awed by both the represented object and the\ndivine artistry that lies behind it and by the \u201cgreat wit,\ngenius, imagination, and capacities of the soul\u201d of the human\nartist who produces the image of the work of divine artistry.\nWhat especially pleases us in the case of art,\nconsidered as art, is the reference to the spiritual gifts of the\nartist which make themselves visibly known. If they bear the\ncharacteristics of an uncommon genius\u2026then they inspire awe on\nour part. (\u201cThe Sublime and Na\u00efve\u201d; Philosophical\nWritings, pp. 196\u20137)\n\n\n\nWe may now turn to the famous controversy between Lessing and\nWinckelmann, built upon Mendelssohn\u2019s distinction between the arts of\nform and the arts of movement.\n4.2 Winckelmann\n\n Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717\u20131768), the son of a cobbler\n from Prussia, studied at Halle and Jena, and became a school\n teacher. But at thirty-one he got a position as a librarian for a\n nobleman in Dresden, and gained access to the court of the Elector\n of Saxony, home of one of the great art collections of Europe, and\n also a Catholic court that ultimately gave him access to Rome. He\n established his reputation in 1755 with an essay \u201cOn the\n Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture.\u201d He moved\n to Rome later that year, in the service of the Papal Nuncio to the\n Saxon court, and in 1758 entered the service of Cardinal Allessandro\n Albani, the nephew of Pope Clement XI and owner of a great\n collection of antiquities. In 1764 Winckelmann published The\n History of Ancient Art to great acclaim. He was working on a\n revision of it when he was murdered in Trieste in June of 1768,\n while returning to Rome from Vienna, where the Empress Maria Theresa\n had awarded him a collection of gold and silver medallions.\n\n\nWinckelmann spent his two years in Halle (1738\u201340) while\nBaumgarten was still teaching there and Meier was also a student.  But\nhis writing offers no evidence that he knew their\nworks. His History of Ancient Art does cite Du Bos, Batteux,\nand the essays of Hume, however, and he had clearly absorbed some of\nthe most general ideas of eighteenth-century aesthetics. A 1763 essay\n\u201cOn the Capacity for the Sentiment for the Beautiful in Art, and\non Instruction in it\u201d suggests several of the premises assumed\nthroughout his work on ancient art history. He shares with Wolff and\nBatteux the assumption that art derives its beauty from the imitation\nof nature, and derives the most beauty from the imitation of beauty in\nnature. Thus he writes that\nArt, as an imitator of nature, should always seek\nout what is natural for the form of beauty, and should avoid, as much\nas is possible, all that is violent, because even the beauty in life\ncan become displeasing through forced gestures. (\u201cOn the\nCapacity for the Sentiment for the Beautiful in Art,\u201d Essays\non the Philosophy and History of Art, volume I, p. xlvi)\n\n\nHowever, Winckelmann believes that natural beauty\nitself lies not merely in the superficial appearance of bodies but,\nat least in the case of human beauty, is an expression of the thought\nand character of persons: \nAbove all things, one\nis to be attentive to the particular, characteristic thoughts in\nworks of art, which sometimes stand like expensive pearls in a string\nof inferior ones, and can get lost among them. Our contemplation\nshould begin with the effects of the understanding as the most worthy\npart of beauty, and from there should descend to the execution\n\n\na point that he illustrates with examples from\nthe paintings of Poussin, Corregio, and Domenichino rather than from\nancient art (\u201cThe Sentiment for the Beautiful,\u201d p. xlv).\nWinckelmann clearly belongs to the tradition that finds beauty in the\ntruthful representation of the objective perfections of body and mind,\nrather than in the stimulation of the play of the mental powers of the\naudience for beauty.\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s premises underlie his history of ancient art, the main\nclaims of which are already evident in his 1755 essay \u201cOn the\nImitation of the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks.\u201d This\nessay begins with the claim that \u201cThere is but one way for the\nmoderns to become great, and perhaps unequalled; I mean, by imitating\nthe ancients\u201d (Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of\nthe Greeks, p. 2; in Essays on the Philosophy and History of\nArt, volume I). His topic is thus in the first instance the\nimitation of ancient art, not imitation in ancient\nart. Winckelmann then attributes the excellent of ancient, that is to\nsay Greek, art to three factors: first, nature in ancient Greece was\nparticularly favorable to the development of beautiful bodies; second,\nthe \u201cnatural\u201d way of life in Greece was particularly\nfavorable to the observation of beautiful bodies and thus to their\nimitation in art; and finally, Greek thought and character\nwere particularly noble, and thus the external beauty of Greek bodies\nwas an expression of the beauty of the Greek mind as the \u201cmost\nworthy part of beauty.\u201d The first of these claims is in the\ntradition of the emphasis of the influence of climate on human\ncharacter and society initiated by Du Bos and continued by many\neighteenth-century thinkers, including Montesquieu in The Spirit\nof the Laws (1748).\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s second point is that the Greek climate and way of life\nwere conducive to the development of art. He makes the general claim\nthat freedom is conducive to the development of art:\nArt claims liberty: in vain would nature produce\nher noblest offsprings, in a country where rigid laws would choke her\nprogressive growth, as in Egypt, that pretended parent of sciences and\narts: but in Greece, where, from their earliest youth, the happy\ninhabitants were devoted to mirth and pleasure, where narrow-spirited\nformality never restrained the liberty of manners, the artist enjoyed\nnature without a veil.\n\n\nWinckelmann then makes the specific point that\nfreedom from excessive clothing among the Greeks, particularly in\ntheir gymnastic and athletic exercises, gave their artists\nunparalleled opportunity to observe and to learn to represent the\nbeauty of their bodies:\nThe Gymnasies, where, sheltered by public modesty,\nthe youths exercised themselves naked, were the schools of\nart\u2026. Here beautiful nakedness appeared with such a liveliness\nof expression, such truth and variety of situations, such a noble air\nof the body, as it would be ridiculous to look for in any hired model\nof our academies. (\u201cImitation,\u201d pp. 9\u201310)\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s reference to expression and\nnobility here points the way to his last claim, that above all the\nbodily beauty of the Greeks is an expression of their mental and moral\nbeauty:\nThe last and most eminent characteristic of the\nGreek works is a noble simplicity and sedate grandeur in Gesture and\nExpression. As the bottom of the sea lies peaceful beneath a foaming\nsurface, a great soul lies sedate beneath the strife of passions in\nGreek figures. (\u201cImitation,\u201d p. 30)\n\n\n\nWinckelmann illustrates the last claim with a discussion of the famous\nstatue of the Trojan priest Laoco\u00f6n and his sons being strangled by\nthe serpents Neptune sent to stifle his warnings against accepting the\n\u201cgift\u201d of the Trojan horse. The version of this statue\nthat was unearthed near Naples in 1506 and quickly acquired by Pope\nJulius II for the Vatican, where it has been displayed ever since, is\nnow thought to be a Roman copy of a Pergamese bronze from the second\ncentury BCE, and may or may not be the same one described by Pliny\n(Natural History, XXXV). Winckelmann took it to be a\nclassical Greek work. He also must have known it only from\nillustration when he first wrote about it in \u201cOn the Imitation\nof the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks,\u201d since he moved to\nRome only after that essay was published. Be that as it may,\nWinckelmann writes:\n\n\n\u2019Tis in the face of Laoco\u00f6n this soul shines with full lustre, not\nconfined however to the face, amidst the most violent\nsufferings. Pangs piercing every muscle, every labouring nerve; pangs\nwhich we almost feel ourselves, while we consider\u2014not the face,\nnor the most expressive parts\u2014only the belly contracted by\nexcruciating pains: these however, I say, exert not themselves with\nviolence, either in the face or gesture. He pierces not heaven, like\nthe Laoco\u00f6n of Virgil; his mouth is rather opened to\ndischarge an anxious overloaded groan, as Sadolet says; the\nstruggling body and the supporting mind exert themselves with equal\nstrength, nay balance all the frame.\n\n\nLaoco\u00f6n suffers, but suffers like the Philoctetes\nof Sophocles: we weeping feel his pains, but wish for the\nhero\u2019s strength to support his misery.\n\n\nThe Expression of so great a soul is beyond the force of mere\nnature. It was in his own mind the artist was to search for the\nstrength of spirit with which he marked his marble. Greece enjoyed\nartists and philosophers in the same persons; and the wisdom of more\nthan one Metrodorus directed art, and inspired its figures with more\nthan common souls.\n\n\n\nThe last paragraph of this is somewhat contorted: since Laoco\u00f6n was\nnot himself a classical Greek, but a pre-classical Trojan, Winckelmann\ndoes not quite attribute the \u201cnoble simplicity and quiet\ngrandeur\u201d that shines through his face even in the midst of his\nsuffering to him and to nature as it might have been at work in Troy,\nbut rather to the classical Greek artist whom he supposes did make the\nstatue. But his basic point remains: since in his view the statue\nitself was Greek, the noble simplicity and quiet grandeur of the Greek\nsoul inevitably manifests itself and elevates these figures caught in\na moment of supreme suffering to the highest level of beauty.\n\n\nWinckelmann\u2019s History of Ancient Art, published nine years\nafter the essay on imitation, reaffirms his general commitment to\ncontemporary aesthetics as well as his particular emphasis on a\ncertain kind of mental condition as the ultimate source of physical\nbeauty. It nevertheless gives a slightly different and perhaps more\nplausible account of the Laoco\u00f6n statue, which by then he had seen\nfirst-hand. To general statements on beauty as unity and simplicity\n(History, p. 196) and the beauty of youthfulness (p. 197)\nWinckelmann adds a passage on the expression of inward attitude that\nis reminiscent of his description of the \u201cnoble simplicity and\nquiet grandeur\u201d of the Greeks in the earlier\nessay: \n\nExpression is an imitation of the active and suffering states\nof our minds and our bodies and of passions as well as\ndeeds\u2026Stillness is the state most proper to beauty, as it is to\nthe sea, and experience shows that the most beautiful beings are of a\nstill and well-mannered nature.  (History, p.  204)\n\n\nBut, as noted, in the History\nWinckelmann gives a slightly different account of the Laoco\u00f6n, in\nwhich he suggests that the beauty of the central figure of the work\nlies not so much in the nobility of character that is\nexpressed in spite of Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s agony, but rather in a kind\nof harmony between his agony and his nobility:\nLaoco\u00f6n is a being in the greatest pain, fashioned\nin the likeness of a man seeking to gather the conscious strength of\nhis mind and spirit against it\u2026. Beneath the brow, the battle\nbetween pain and resistance, as if concentrated in this one place, is\ncomposed with great wisdom\u2026Thus, where the greatest pain is\nexpressed, the greatest beauty is also to be\nfound. (History, pp. 313\u201314)\n\n4.3 Lessing\n\nThis description of the Laoco\u00f6n has been of great interest to\nrecent interpreters, but it was Winckelmann\u2019s earlier account that\ninspired the criticism of Lessing, whose Laoco\u00f6n: An Essay on\nthe Limits of Painting and Poetry, although not published until\n1766, was clearly begun and largely written before the appearance of\nWinckelmann\u2019s History in 1764. Lessing\u2019s work was thus a\nresponse to the earlier essay (only in chapter 26, almost at the end\nof the book, does Lessing say that Winckelmann\u2019s History\n\u201chas appeared, and I shall not venture another step until I have\nread it\u201d). Lessing\u2019s book, although part of the larger\neighteenth-century debate about the comparative merits of literature\nand the visual arts that builds upon the division of the arts by his\nfriend Mendelssohn, first argues against Winckelmann that the beauty\nof the Laoco\u00f6n statue comes not from the special nobility of the\nGreek soul but from the particular demands of its visual rather than\nliterary medium.\n\n\nLessing published his Laoco\u00f6n at the midpoint of his varied\nliterary and intellectual career. Lessing, like Mendelssohn born in\n1729, was the oldest of thirteen children of a Saxon pastor, and at\ntwelve he entered the monastic school at Meissen; at seventeen he went\nto Leipzig to study theology, then changed to medicine, and then to\nthe university at Wittenberg. But at twenty, he left the university\nand went to Berlin to make a career as a writer. There he quickly met\namong others Voltaire, at that time employed by Frederick the Great,\nas well as Mendelssohn. In 1755, Lessing had his great success with\nthe bourgeois tragedy Miss Sara Sampson, which initiated a\nnew direction in the German theater. In 1758, he started collaborating\nwith Mendelssohn and Friedrich Nicolai on the Letters concerning\nthe newest literature. From 1760 to 1765 Lessing worked as\nsecretary to the governor of Silesia in Breslau, during which time he\nwrote Laoco\u00f6n as well as the comedy Minna von\nBarnhelm. He returned to Berlin again in 1765, but, disappointed\nin his hopes for the position of Royal Librarian, went to Hamburg in\n1767 as director of the National Theater. The program notes he wrote\nin that capacity became his Hamburg Dramaturgy, his most\nextended critical work. In 1770 Lessing finally found a secure post as\nlibrarian for the great collection of the Dukes of Brunswick in\nWolffenb\u00fcttel, where he remained until his death in 1781. There he\nwrote the tragedy Emilia Galotti and his famous plea for\nreligious tolerance in the form of Nathan the Wise, a play\ninspired by Mendelssohn. In addition to various theological polemics,\nhe also published his Education of the Human Race the year\nbefore his death.\n\n\nThe thesis of Laoco\u00f6n, as already suggested, is that the\ncharacter of the famous statue is due not to the nobility of the Greek\nmind but to the imperatives of its visual medium.  Lessing begins his\nwork by quoting the passage from Winckelmann\u2019s essay \u201cOn\nthe Imitation of the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks\u201d quoted above (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, p. 7). He then argues\nthat the Greek, like anyone else, \u201cfelt and feared, and he\nexpressed his pain and grief,\u201d and that this was not thought to\nbe incompatible with nobility of soul; he appeals to examples from\nHomer\u2019s Iliad to prove this point. So he concludes that\nif, according to the ancient Greek, crying aloud\nwhen in physical pain is compatible with nobility of soul, then the\ndesire to express such nobility could not have prevented the artist\nfrom representing the scream in his marble, There must be another\nreason why he differs on this point from his rival the\npoet. (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, pp. 9\u201311)\n\n\nThe reason, Lessing claims, is\nthat among the ancients beauty was the supreme law\nof the visual arts. Once this has been established, it necessarily\nfollows that whatever else these arts may include must give way\ncompletely if not compatible with beauty, and, if compatible, must at\nleast be subordinate to it.\n\n\nIn the case of the story of Laoco\u00f6n, since\nThe demands of beauty could not be reconciled with\n[his] pain in all its disfiguring violence, so it had to be\nreduced. The scream had to be softened to a sigh, not because\nscreaming betrays an ignoble soul, but because it distorts the\nfeatures in a disgusting manner. (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, pp. 15,\n17)\n\n\nIndeed, in a later discussion of the demands of\nreligion on visual art, Lessing adds that\n\nI should prefer that only those be called works of art in which the\nartist had occasion to show himself as such and in which beauty was\nhis first and ultimate aim. None of the others, which betray too\nobvious traces of religious conventions, deserves this name because in\ntheir case the artist did not create for art\u2019s sake [weil die\nKunst hier nicht um ihren selbst willen gearbeitet, literally\n\u201cbecause here art did not work for its own sake\u201d], but his\nart was merely a handmaid of religion, which stressed meaning more\nthan beauty in the material subjects it allotted to art for execution.\n(Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 1, pp. 15, 17)\n\n\n\nThe phrase \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d is often thought to be a\nnineteenth-century invention, but here Lessing clearly anticipates it,\nmeaning that at least in the visual arts all other considerations must\nbe subordinated to the creation of beauty.\n\n\nLessing does not appeal to any philosophical theory to back up this\ninsistence. But his next step is to buttress his argument by borrowing\nMendelssohn\u2019s idea that since the visual arts present objects in a\nsingle moment, they must choose that moment carefully, and in\nparticular they must choose a moment that gives \u201cfree\nrein\u201d to the imagination. Even if it were to be conceded that\n\u201cTruth and expression are art\u2019s first law,\u201d which Lessing\nis not actually willing to concede, this would still hold. Thus\npaintings and sculptures must not represent the moment of the\nculmination of an action, which leaves nothing further to the\nimagination, but a moment of anticipation which leaves the imagination\nfree to play with further possibilities (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 3,\np. 19). The artist of the Laoco\u00f6n did not represent his subject at the\nmoment of his greatest pain and full scream because that would have\nforeclosed the free play of the imagination of the audience for the\nwork. Here Lessing at least tacitly invokes the new theory that the\nplay of our mental powers rather than the representation of some form\nof truth is the fundamental aim of art, or at least visual art.\n\n\nLessing continues his argument by turning to the other half of\nMendelssohn\u2019s theory, the claim that poetry is an art that\ncan represent a succession of events over time rather than one moment\nin time. \u201cAccordingly, bodies with their visible properties are\nthe true subjects of painting,\u201d while, since actions take place\nover time, \u201cactions are the true subjects of poetry.\u201d\nThus, \u201cpainting too can imitate actions, but only by suggestion\nthrough bodies,\u201d and again \u201ccan use only a single moment\nof an action in its coexisting compositions and must therefore choose\nthe one that is most suggestive.\u201d Conversely, in order to\nrepresent a body poetry can only describe an action in which the body\nis made, used, or otherwise involved (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 16,\npp. 78\u20139). This leads Lessing to a memorable analysis of some\nexamples from Homer: \u201cIf Homer wants to show us Juno\u2019s chariot,\nhe shows Hebe putting it together piece by piece\u201d; when he\n\u201cwants to show us how Agamemnon was dressed, he has the king put\non his garments, one by one,\u201d and, most famously, when he wants\nto show us Achilles\u2019s shield, he does not describe it \u201cas\nfinished and complete, but as a shield that is being made\u201d\n(Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 16, p. 80; chapter 18, p. 95).\n\n\nSo far, Lessing has merely rejected Winckelmann\u2019s analysis of the\nLaoco\u00f6n statue on the basis of his own insistence that beauty is the\nprimary aim of visual art as well as on Mendelssohn\u2019s distinction\nbetween arts that can represent one moment and arts that can represent\na succession of moments. But he broadens his target when he says, in a\npassing discussion of the fact that both Homer and Milton were blind,\nthat \u201cif the range of my physical sight must be the measure of\nmy inner vision, I should value the loss of the former in order to\ngain freedom from the limitations on the latter\u201d\n(Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 14, p. 74). Here his implication is that\nsight actually constrains the imagination, while non-visual\nmedia\u2014in other words, poetry\u2014free the imagination for a\nwider play with both ideas and emotions. This point could also be\nthought to depend on one of Mendelssohn\u2019s ideas, namely his contrast\nbetween natural and arbitrary or conventional signs. Lessing touches\nupon this in passing, arguing that although \u201cthe symbols of\nspeech are arbitrary,\u201d the poet actually wants to overcome our\nawareness of that fact:\nHe wants rather to make the ideas he awakens in us\nso vivid that at the moment we believe that we feel the real\nimpressions which the objects of these ideas would produce in us. In\nthis moment of illusion we should cease to be conscious of the means\nwhich the poet uses for this purpose, that is, his\nwords. (Laoco\u00f6n, chapter 17, p. 85)\n\n\n\nBut while emphasizing that the poet aims to create a vivid response in\nus, in particular a vivid emotional response, Lessing fails to mention\nMendelssohn\u2019s point that we also need to retain some awareness of the\nartificiality rather than reality of the artistic depiction of persons\nand actions in order to maintain the distance necessary to allow us to\nenjoy the emotions evoked by art rather than being overwhelmed by them\ninto actual suffering. He does not need to mention this, perhaps, in\nthe case of the visual arts, since he holds that the visual artist\nleaves the audience some freedom of imagination by not depicting the\nmoment of the greatest suffering of his subject, and this freedom may\nafford the necessary distance, but he might have done well to mention\nit in the case of poetry.\n\n\nLessing thus touches upon the new idea that aesthetic response is\nbased on the free play of our mental powers stimulated by an object,\nin his case always by a work of art, and he exploits several of\nMendelssohn\u2019s theoretical tools. He should nevertheless be seen as a\npracticing critic using theoretical developments for his own purposes\nrather than as a theorist in his own right. However, his criticism\nimmediately triggered more philosophical aesthetics in response. In\nthe next section, we shall see how Johann Gottfried Herder reasserted\nyet refined an aesthetics of truth beginning with a response to\nLessing, while Johann Georg Sulzer attempted to combine an aesthetics\nof truth with an aesthetics of play. Sulzer\u2019s combination of the\naesthetics of truth and play would in turn prepare the way for Kant,\nwhile Herder\u2019s final work, more than twenty years after he completed\nhis main work in aesthetics, would be a critique of Kant\u2019s\naesthetics. This section will also include a discussion of the\naesthetic theory of Marcus Herz, who was first a student of Kant and\nthen a friend of Mendelssohn, but who developed an aesthetic theory\nthat is in interesting ways independent of both.\n5. Herder, Sulzer and Herz: Energy, Activity and Truth\n5.1 Herder\n\nJohann Gottfried Herder (1744\u20131803) is most often remembered\nfor his philosophy of history, expounded with relative brevity in his\n1774 work This Too a Philosophy of History for the Education of\nHumanity and at great length in his Ideas for the Philosophy\nof History of Humanity, published from 1784 to 1791. He is\ntypically read as having advocated cultural relativism and\nhistoricism against the universalist pretensions of the\nEnlightenment\u2014manifested in aesthetics in the search for a\nuniversally valid \u201cstandard of taste\u201d\u2014and thus as\nhaving been a forerunner of Romanticism. Our focus here will be on\nHerder\u2019s work in aesthetics, which fully occupied him for the first\nfifteen years of his career, as well as at the very end of his\ncareer, when he wrote a vigorous polemic against the aesthetic theory\nof Kant. In this section we will consider Herder\u2019s early work in\naesthetics, while discussion of his later work will be reserved for\nsection 9.\n\n\nHerder came from East Prussia, and from 1762 to 1764 was a student in\nK\u00f6nigsberg, where he studied with Kant. He later turned away from\nKant, whom he saw as having himself turned away from an empirical\napproach to philosophy to one that is excessively abstract and a\npriori. From 1762 to 1769, he taught school in Riga, and then\nleft for a tour of France and Western Germany, during which he met the\nyoung Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, shortly to become famous for The\nSorrows of Young Werther. Indeed, after Herder served as preacher\nin the small court of B\u00fcckeburg from 1771 to 1776, Goethe had him\nappointed as the General Superintendent of Lutheran clergy in the\nDuchy of Weimar, where Goethe himself was the chief minister. This\nposition, which Herder occupied for the rest of his life, gave him\nample time to write and put him into contact with the many other\nleading figures of late eighteenth-century German literary and\nintellectual life whom Goethe brought to Weimar.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s first major work in aesthetics, Fragments on Recent\nGerman Literature, appeared in 1767, when he was only\ntwenty-three. The first three volumes of his next work, the Groves\nof Criticism (Kritische Waelder) were published in\n1769. The first volume of the Groves is a spirited but\nfriendly critique of Lessing\u2019s Laoco\u00f6n, the next two a\ndetailed polemic against the now forgotten Halle rhetorician Christian\nKlotz (whom Lessing also attacked in a 1769 essay on \u201cHow the\nAncients Depicted Death\u201d). The fourth volume, a polemic against\nthe now equally forgotten Friedrich Justus Riedel, who had published a\nhodgepodge Theory of the Fine Arts and Sciences: Extracts from\nvarious Authors in 1767, remained unpublished during Herder\u2019s\nlifetime. Herder did, however, restate its most important ideas\nin Sculpture: Some Observations on Shape and Form from Pygmalion\u2019s\nCreative Dream, begun in 1770 although itself not completed and\npublished until 1778. Herder\u2019s work on Sculpture was\ninterrupted by several of what are now his best-known works,\nthe Treatise on the Origin of Language (1772) and This\nToo a Philosophy of History for the Education of Humanity\n(1774). After finishing Sculpture, Herder published a\ncollection of folk poetry from around the world, Popular\nSongs (1778\u201379), a work on the Old Testament, On the\nSpirit of Hebrew Poetry (1782\u201383), the large work on\nphilosophy of history already mentioned, an influential defense of\nSpinoza under the name of God: Some Conversations (1787), a\nwork on political philosophy, the Letters for the Advancement of\nHumanity (1793\u201397), and finally his critiques of Kant\u2019s\ntheoretical philosophy and aesthetics, A Metacritique on the\nCritique of Pure Reason (1799) and the Kalligone or\n\u201cBirth of Beauty\u201d (1800).  In these works Kant\u2019s harsh\ncriticisms of his quondam student\u2019s Ideas for a Philosophy of\nHistory of Humanity were repaid with interest.\n\n\nLessing, as we saw, had argued that visual art presents an object as\nit is at a single moment and thus can only intimate an action, while\npoetry describes a succession of states comprising an action and thus\ncan represent an object only by describing the act of producing it; he\nalso argued that beauty is the first law of the visual arts and thus\nthat a work of art must not only depict an object at a pregnant moment\nin an action or event but must also depict it at a beautiful\nmoment. In his critique in the first of his Groves of\nCriticism, Herder argues that Lessing\u2019s division of the arts was\ntoo schematic and incomplete, offering three particular points of\ncriticism against Lessing. He first claims that Lessing fails to\nexplain why beauty must be the first law of the visual arts. He\nfurther insists that there is an essential difference within\nthe so-called visual arts that Lessing fails to capture, namely that\npainting is concerned strictly with with the sense of sight whereas\nthe aesthetics of sculpture in fact derive primarily from the sense of\ntouch. Herder\u2019s third critical thesis is that Lessing\u2019s emphasis on\ntime and succession in poetry better fits the art of music, which\nLessing ignored, while the essence of poetry lies not in such an\naccidental feature of the kind of signs that it uses but in the way in\nwhich it captures and communicates the energy of real life,\nsomething no other art does equally well. Herder\u2019s contrast between\npainting and sculpture becomes central in the argument of the fourth\nof the Groves of Criticism and in the essay\non Sculpture, so let us consider the other two themes first\nand then return to that one.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s first charge is that Lessing fails to explain why beauty must\nbe the first law of the visual arts. In Herder\u2019s view, visual art must\naim at beauty because only in that way can it overcome the essential\nconflict between its own spatial, static character and the incessantly\nchanging, transitory character of everything in nature.\nIn nature everything is transitory, the passion of\nthe soul and the sensation of the body: the activity of the soul and\nthe motion of the body: every state of changeable finite nature. Now\nif art has only one instant in which everything is to be contained:\nthen every alterable state of nature is unnaturally immortalized\nthrough it, and thus with this principle all imitation of nature\nthrough art cease. (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p.  133)\n\n\nFurthermore, all ordinary sensuous pleasures are\nalso momentary: \u201cAll sensible joys are only for the first\nglance\u201d (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 134). The only way\nfor an essentially static art to overcome the transitory nature of\nboth what it depicts and of ordinary pleasures is by picking a\nbeautiful moment which is as it were exempt from the actual\ntransitoriness of an object\u2019s history in real nature and our pleasure\nin which also does not fade like other pleasures do (\u201cFirst\nGrove,\u201d p. 137). In other words, our pleasure in beauty in a\nsense lifts us out of the ordinary passage of time. However, Herder\nquickly adds that not any kind of beauty can do this: bodily beauty\nis too closely connected with time, so a truly beautiful work must\nsomehow instead intimate the beauty of soul rather than body:\n\u201cCorporeal beauty is not satisfying: through our eye there\nlooks a soul, and through the beauty that is represented to us a soul\nthus also peers\u201d (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d\npp. 137\u20138).\n\n\nHowever, this opening sally against Lessing is misleading in two\nregards, first for its suggestion that the task for aesthetics is to\ngive a better explanation of beauty than Lessing did and second for\nits suggestion that aesthetics must be grounded on a metaphysical\ndistinction between mind and body. The latter suggestion is misleading\nbecause Herder does more than almost anyone else in eighteenth-century\nGermany to minimize any separation between mind and body. This is a\nresult of his emphasis on the connection between thought and speech,\nbodily sensation and expression, and the natural and man-made\nenvironment of the linguistic community. The former suggestion is also\nmisleading because, while Herder will go on to argue that painting in\nparticular strives after beauty, he also links beauty to mere\nappearance Indeed, he connects beauty with illusion. Herder also\nargues that both sculpture, which he emphatically distinguishes from\npainting, and poetry ultimately aim much more at truth than\nat beauty. Herder\u2019s path to this conclusion is not direct, however,\nand just what sense or senses of truth he has in mind is difficult to\npin down, so we will have to look at his classification of the arts in\nsome detail to see how to construe his theory.\n\n\nIn fact, Herder suggests two different classifications of the arts,\nand a central challenge in the interpretation of his aesthetics is to\nsee how they are connected. In the first of the Groves of\nCriticism, Herder argues that Lessing\u2019s distinction between the\nvisual arts as the representation of objects in space at a single\nmoment in time and poetry as the representation of a succession of\nevents in time confuses poetry with music. Lessing thereby misses what\nis essential to poetry altogether, namely that it communicates to us\nthe real force of objects, including but not limited to\nactions, and thus most deeply engages our own force in response. The\nfirst part of this argument is that the contrast between the\ncoexistence of the properties of an object in space and the succession\nof events in time properly grounds the contrast between painting and\nmusic, not between painting and poetry, and that both painting and\nmusic depend upon natural signs of coexistence and succession\n(\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 193).  Both painting\u2014which Herder\nis thus far, like Lessing, using as a generic term for the visual arts\ncomprising both painting proper and sculpture\u2014and music use\nnatural signs, that is, signs that communicate the thought of their\nobjects to us by means of resemblance between their own fundamental\nproperties and the fundamental properties of their objects. Painting\nand music are thus best suited to represent objects in space and\nsuccessions of events in time, respectively.  Poetry, however, uses primarily\nartificial rather than natural signs, and is thus, unlike music, not\nrestricted to the depiction of events as Lessing thought it was\n(\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d pp. 193\u20134).  Herder turns Lessing\u2019s\ndistinction between natural and artificial signs against him, arguing\nthat precisely because poetry uses artificial rather than natural\nsigns its content is in no fundamental way constrained by the natural\nproperties of its signs themselves. Thus, in the proper hands poetry\ncan effectively represent anything, and in this way it\ncertainly has a wider sphere of truth accessible to it than\npainting or music do.\n\n\nBut this is only the first step of Herder\u2019s argument.  The second step\nargues that just as Lessing\u2019s division of the arts into painting and\npoetry is incomplete, the distinction between space and time on which\nthe former division is based is also incomplete. This is because\nLessing\u2019s distinction leaves out the essential category\nof force (Kraft), and precisely this last category\nis essential to the effect of poetry (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d\np. 194). Herder is not particularly clear about the difference between\nthe energy (Energie) that is displayed in music and the force that is at work in poetry, but his idea seems to be\nthat energy is the outward manifestation, in change or motion,\nof underlying forces. Poetry, precisely because it employs\nartificial rather than natural signs, can therefore bring us closer to\nthe reality that underlies the superficial features of objects\ncaptured by artificial signs. Thus poetry may reach not only wider but\nalso deeper than these other arts.\n\n\nIn continuing his discussion of poetry in the first Grove,\nHerder initially emphasizes the broader reach of poetry: precisely\nbecause in taking in poetry we do not focus on the physical or\nacoustical properties of the signs themselves, but on their meanings,\npoetry can represent anything. In poetry, it is\nnot the sign itself but the sense [Sinn] of the sign that\nmust be felt; the soul must not feel the vehicle of the force, the\nwords, but the force itself, the sense\u2026But thereby it\nalso brings every object as it were visibly before the\nsoul. (\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 195)\n\n\nHerder then develops his view by invoking\nBaumgarten\u2019s characterization of poetry as \u201cthe sensibly perfect\nin discourse.\u201d What he now argues is that poetry actually gets\nits force by exploiting both the depiction of objects as in painting\nand their energy as represented by music. Once painting and music have\nbeen properly distinguished from each other and poetry from both, it\nbecomes clear that poetry, because it uses artificial rather than\nnatural signs, can present both objects and actions to us. It is in\nthis sense that poetry can present more truth to us than either\npainting or music alone.\n\n\nWhat remains unclear, however, is just what Herder means by\n\u201cforce\u201d here. He only hints at what he might mean a few\npages later when he says that \u201cthe essence of poetry\u201d is\n\u201cthe force, which adheres to the inner in words, the magical\nforce, which works on my soul through fantasy and recollection\u201d\n(\u201cFirst Grove,\u201d p. 197). The force unique to poetry seems\nto be precisely its power to make us feel as if the objects and events\nit describes are real and thereby to engage our own emotions and\npassions more fully than the other arts can. But he may make clearer\nwhat he has in mind in his praise for the poetry of primitive peoples\nin a famous 1773 essay on what were later to be revealed to be the\nfraudulent poems of the fictional Scottish bard \u201cOssian.\u201d\nThis essay was included in a collection On German Style and\nArt that also included Herder\u2019s equally famous essay on\nShakespeare (to which we will return below) and a seminal essay by\nGoethe that revived interest in Gothic architecture. Here Herder declaims:\n\n\nKnow then, that the more barbarous a people is\u2014that is, the more\nalive, the more freely acting (for that is what the word\nmeans)\u2014the more barbarous, that is, the more alive, the more\nfree, the closer to the senses, the more lyrically dynamic its songs\nwill be, if songs it has. The more remote a people is from an\nartificial, scientific manner of thinking, speaking, and writing, the\nless its songs are made for paper and print, the less its verses are\nwritten for the dead letter. The purpose, the nature, the miraculous\npower of these songs as the delight, the driving-force, the\ntraditional chant and everlasting joy of the people\u2014all this\ndepends on the lyrical, living, dance-like quality of the song, on the\nliving presence of the images, and the coherence and, as it were\ncompulsion of the content, the feelings; on the symmetry of the words\nand syllables, and sometimes even of the letters, on the flow of the\nmelody, and on a hundred other things which belong to the living\nworld, to the gnomic song of the nation, and vanish with\nit. (\u201cOssian,\u201d pp. 155\u20136)\n\n\nLeave aside the fact that the poems of the supposed Ossian were\nconcocted in eighteenth-century Edinburgh by James MacPherson, and\nwere thus very much made for paper and print. Leave aside as well\nHerder\u2019s supposition that the most dynamic poetry can only be composed\nby a \u201cbarbarous people,\u201d Mycenaen Greeks or Scottish\nhighlanders. The point remains that he connects the \u201cliving\npresence of the images\u201d achieved by the most effective poetry\nwith a corresponding feeling of freedom and of being\nalive. Paradoxically, poetry\u2019s use of artificial rather than natural\nsigns, which allows it to achieve the effects of painting and music\ncombined, also allows it to engage our deepest emotions more\nthoroughly than those other arts, including ultimately the joyous\nfeeling of being alive itself, even though the other arts use natural\nsigns and might therefore have been thought to be more effective.\n\n\nWe may now turn to Herder\u2019s second main criticism of Lessing, hinted\nat in the first of the Groves of Criticism but more fully\ndeveloped in the unpublished fourth Grove and the essay on Sculpture. The fourth Grove\nis cast as a critique of Riedel\u2019s Theory of the Fine Sciences and\nArts, as earlier noted, but also continues the debate with\nLessing. Herder begins with several methodological objections to\nRiedel. First, although he otherwise admires Baumgarten, Herder\ncriticizes Riedel\u2019s acceptance of Baumgarten\u2019s characterization of\naesthetics as both a theory of beauty and \u201cthe art of thinking\nbeautifully,\u201d that is, a prescription of concrete rules and\nmethods for artists to follow in order to produce beautiful or\notherwise successful works (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d\np. 267). Herder is clear that there are no such rules, thus that\naesthetics must confine itself to understanding the work of artists\nand our experience of their work without telling them how to do that\nwork. Second, Herder objects to a tripartite classification of the\nmethods of aesthetics, as such a theory, that Riedel\nproposes. According to Riedel, aesthetic theories can be divided into\nthose employing the methods of Aristotle, Baumgarten, or Kames: the\nAristotelian method aims to reach general principles from the analysis\nof particular masterpieces of art, the method of Kames tries to reach\nthe same goal from the analysis of our sensations in response to\naesthetic objects, and what Riedel characterizes as the\n\u201cmiserable dry\u201d method of Baumgarten simply begins from\ndefinitions (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d p. 262). In Herder\u2019s view,\nthese distinctions are artificial and the characterization of\nBaumgarten\u2019s method in particular is unfair. Although the charge that\nBaumgarten simply began with definitions may seem a fair critique of\nhis early Meditations on Poetry, Herder must have felt that\nin his larger and more mature Aesthetica Baumgarten did\nsupport his definitions by his extensive examples. In any case,\nHerder\u2019s own method is certainly to reach general conclusions only\nfrom close examination of examples of art and of our response to\nthem. This is why he engages Lessing in such detail, for example, and\nwhy some of his most important claims in aesthetics are contained in\nthe essays on Ossian and Shakespeare. Further, Herder\u2019s approach ends\nrather than begins with definitions.\n\n\nThe main thrust of the fourth Grove, building upon Herder\u2019s\ninsistence that aesthetics must employ the methods of both Aristotle\nand Kames in order to reach Baumgartian conclusions, is that\nrecognition of the distinctions among our senses will explain the\nvariety of both forms of art and forms of aesthetic response. The\npremise of Herder\u2019s argument is that aesthetic response is not the\ndisinterested reaction of a special internal sense to purely formal\nproperties of objects, but is really the heightened response of\nvarious of our senses to their appropriate objects. Aesthetic\nresponses naturally emerge from our senses. Herder rejects the\ntraditional distinction between mind and body, arguing that mind is\nessentially connected to the bodily organs of sense, as well as any\nsuggestion that aesthetic pleasures are essentially distinct from the\nother sources of our happiness and unhappiness. In this connection,\nHerder scorns Riedel\u2019s thesis that the beautiful is that \u201cwhich\ncan please without an interested aim and thus also please if we do not\npossess it\u201d (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d p. 291n.), thereby\nprefiguring his later critique of Kant\u2019s aesthetics.  Instead, Herder\nargues that the phenomenon of distance that Riedel mistakenly\ncharacterizes as general quality of disinterestedness in all aesthetic\nresponse is a specific feature of the visual perception of beauty,\nindeed that beauty is properly speaking a property only of the\nvisual. This in turn leads Herder to distinguish between sight as a\nsense for mere appearance and touch as the sense for reality, and thus\nto the essential distinction between painting and sculpture which, he\ncharges, Lessing fails to make. Herder insists that visible beauty\narises only from the most superficial features of objects, not from\ntheir full reality, and that only feeling\u2014by which he here means\nthe sense of touch\u2014can put us into direct contact with reality,\nor with the deeper truth about physical reality. He expands upon this\ncontrast in the essay on Sculpture:\n\n\nThe term Sch\u00f6nheit [beauty] derives from the\nwords Schauen [to behold] and Schein\n[appearance]. Beauty can most easily be understood and appreciated in\nterms of Schauen, that is, through sch\u00f6ner Schein\n[beautiful appearance]. Nothing is faster, more dazzlingly brilliant\nthan the light of the sun and our eyes carried upon its wing. A world\nof external things ranged alongside one another is revealed in an\ninstant. Since this world does not disappear as do sounds, but endures\nand invites contemplation, is it any wonder that our doctrine\nof psychology chooses to borrow many of its terms from this sense?\nFor psychology, to know is to see, and its greatest pleasure\nis beauty\u2026. If we succeeded in \u201cderiving\u201d\nfrom this sense alone a true phenomenology of\nthe beautiful and the true, we should already have\nachieved a great deal.\n\nNonetheless, we would not thereby have achieved everything and\ncertainly not what is most fundamental, simple, and\nprimary\u2026. The living, embodied truth of the three-dimensional\nspace of angles, of form and volume, is not something we can learn\nthrough sight. This is all the more true of the essence of\nsculpture, beautiful form and beautiful shape, for\nthis is not a matter of color, or of the play of proportion and\nsymmetry, or of light and shadow, but of physically present,\ntangible truth\u2026. Consider the lover of art sunk deep in\ncontemplation who circles restlessly around a sculpture. What would he\nnot do to transform his sight into touch, to make his seeing\ninto a form of touching that feels in the dark\u2026. With\nhis soul he seeks to grasp the image that arose from the arm\nand the soul of the artist. Now he has it!  The illusion has worked;\nthe sculpture lives and his soul feels that it lives. His\nsoul speaks to it, not as if his soul sees, but as if it touches, as\nif it feels. (Sculpture, pp. 39\u201341)\n\n\n\nHerder\u2019s emphasis on the sense of touch and its centrality to the\nexperience of sculpture builds upon his interpretation of the debate about the relation between sight and touch\nin which Locke, Berkeley, and Diderot had all argued that we do not\ncorrelate the deliverances of the two senses innately, but have to\nlearn from experience that an object that looks a certain way also\nfeels a certain way, or vice versa (see Sculpture, pp.\n33\u20138). But he takes this thesis a step further by arguing that\nit is touch that reveals the true form of objects, while sight merely\nreveals or plays with their superficial appearance. Thus, although\nsight initially seemed to be the paradigmatic vehicle of knowledge,\nHerder ultimately concludes that \u201cin painting there is merely\nbeautiful deception\u201d while in sculpture there is \u201cprimary\ntruth\u201d (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d p. 314).  The passages\nfrom Sculpture also display what Herder thinks is the\nsignificance of the perception of the true form of objects through the\ntactile medium of sculpture: it communicates to us the feeling of life\nin the sculpture and in turn arouses our own feeling of being truly\nalive. In the case of sculpture, both the artist and the audience can\nfully feel the emotions and passions of life that made Pygmalion wish\nthat his beautiful creation could come alive. This view of the power\nof art is what Herder finds missing in Riedel and perhaps even in\nLessing himself.\n\n\nIn the fourth Grove, Herder also has interesting things to\nsay about arts we have not mentioned, namely, dance, architecture, and\nhorticulture, and an important passage about music, which he analyzes\nas the \u201cimitation of human passions,\u201d arousing \u201ca\nseries of inner feelings, true, although not distinct, not intuitive,\nonly extremely obscure\u201d (\u201cFourth Grove,\u201d pp.\n406\u20137). But we will have to leave these arts aside and conclude\nour discussion of Herder with a comment on his supposed historical and\ncultural relativism, which, as was earlier noted, has often been\nthought to be his central contribution to modern thought.  Herder\u2019s\nwritings are certainly replete with observations connecting the\ndifferent circumstances and mores of different cultures and times with\ndifferences in their arts and tastes. For example: \u201cThe Greek,\nthe Gothic, the Moorish taste in architecture and sculpture, in\nmythology and in poetry, is it the same? And is [the difference] not\nto be explained from times, mores, and peoples?\u201d (\u201cFourth\nGrove,\u201d p. 286). And in his essay on Shakespeare, he attacks the\nrigid insistence on unity of time, place, and action in classical\nFrench theater by arguing that these ideals grew naturally out of the\ncircumstances of both Greek theater and Greek life, but that it is\nabsurd to make them into rigid rules in the very different\ncircumstances of both modern theater and modern life\n(\u201cShakespeare,\u201d pp. 162\u20133).\n\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to infer from such comments that Herder\ndoes not think that there are underlying commonalities in the arts and\ntastes of different times and places, or that people living in one\ntime and culture cannot learn to appreciate deeply the art of another\ntime and culture. On the contrary, the argument of the essay on\nShakespeare is that the best art of different times and\nplaces\u2014for example, the theater of Sophocles and that of\nShakespeare\u2014must differ superficially precisely because\nat the deepest level they are committed to the same\nprinciple\u2014the truthful imitation of nature\u2014but\nhave different natures to imitate. Thus he writes that the\nunities of time, place, and action were not artificial for the Greeks\nat all, although it would be for moderns (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d\np. 163). Further, it is precisely because the Greek \u201cview of the\nworld, their customs, the state of the republics, the tradition of the\nheroic age, religion, even music, expression, and the degrees of\nillusion changed\u201d (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d p. 164), that the drama of\nShakespeare was bound to be different than that of Sophocles. It was\nbound to be different because while all these things changed,\nShakespeare was committed to the same underlying principle of\ntruthfully representing his own world that his drama, unlike that of\nthe misguided French classicists, had to look and sound\ndifferent. If Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cworld did not offer such simplicity\nof history, traditions, domestic, political, and religious conditions,\nthen of course it will not display it\u201d in his work either.\nInstead, he will create his \u201cdrama out of [his world\u2019s] own\nhistory, the spirit of its age, customs, views, language, national\nattitudes, traditions, and pastimes\u201d (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d\np. 167). But in doing so, Shakespeare was in fact doing the same thing\nas Sophocles:\nFor Shakespeare is Sophocles\u2019s brother, precisely\nwhere he seems to be so dissimilar, and inwardly he is wholly like\nhim. His whole dramatic illusion is attained by means of this\nauthenticity, truth, and historical\ncreativity. (\u201cShakespeare,\u201d p. 172)\n\n\nPrecisely because the art of Sophocles and that of Shakespeare rest on the same underlying principle it is\npossible for people at any time to come to appreciate them both,\nalthough no doubt with the considerable effort it would take to\nappreciate fully their language, their customs, in short, their\nworlds.\n5.2 Sulzer\n\nHerder is thus no straightforward historicist or cultural\nrelativist. Rather, his convictions that the best art reveals the\ntruth about its world and that there are deep commonalities in human\nemotional responses to such truths allow him to defend the ideal of a\nstandard of or paradigm for taste after all. It will be noted,\nhowever, that throughout Herder\u2019s aesthetics the notion of play has\nhardly figured at all; it has been mentioned only in connection with\nthe superficial art of painting rather than with the deeper arts of\nsculpture, poetry, and even music. For an attempt to combine an\naesthetics of truth with an aesthetics of play that is in some ways\nshallower than Herder\u2019s thought but in other ways an important\ninnovation in German aesthetics, let us now take a look at the work\nof Johann Georg Sulzer (1720\u20131779). He was born a\nquarter-century before Herder but his encyclopedic General Theory\nof the Fine Arts, first published from 1771 to 1774, was\ncontemporaneous with such central works of Herder as the essays on\nOssian and Shakespeare. Sulzer advocates a conventional view of the\nrelation between aesthetic experience and truth: the experience of\nart\u2014although not solely of beautiful art\u2014can make moral\ntruths vivid and efficacious for us, even though we can know those\ntruths independently of art, and indeed must know the most\nfundamental principles of morality independently of art. But he also\nemphasized that aesthetic experience is an intrinsically enjoyable\nand therefore valuable experience of the unhindered activity\nof the mind. His conception of the mind has Leibnizian origins, but\nhis emphasis on the pleasure of its unhindered activity points the\nway toward Kant\u2019s conception of aesthetic experience as the free play\nof the cognitive powers. While Sulzer was generally a more\nconventional thinker than Herder, he here introduces a theme that is\nalmost entirely absent from Herder\u2019s thought and prepares the way for\nKant\u2019s synthesis of two although not all three of the main approaches\nof eighteenth-century aesthetics.\n\n\nSulzer was born in Winthertur, Switzerland, in 1720. Destined for the\nclergy, at sixteen he was boarded with a pastor in Z\u00fcrich and attended\nthe gymnasium there. But at eighteen, he became more interested in the\nstudy of mathematics, botany, and philosophy, and came under the\ninfluence of Bodmer and Breitinger. Sulzer was ordained on the\ncompletion of his studies in 1739, and in 1740 became a tutor in a\nwealthy Z\u00fcrich household. The next year he became a village vicar and\nwas able to devote himself to natural history and archaeology. In 1744\nhe took up a teaching position in Magdeburg, Germany, and in 1747 he\nbecame professor of mathematics at a gymnasium in Berlin. Sulzer was elected to the Academy of Sciences in 1750. From that\ntime on he regularly published essays on reason, consciousness, language,\nmaterialism, the immortality of the soul, and the nature and existence\nof God, as well as a lengthy \u201cInvestigation of the original of\nagreeable and disagreeable sentiments\u201d (1751), which first\nstated central themes of his aesthetics. He also published shorter\ntreatments of such topics as genius (1757), the utility of drama, a\nreply to Rousseau\u2019s attack upon the theater (1760), and \u201cEnergy\nin works of fine art\u201d (1765). In 1755 Sulzer published a\ntranslation of Hume\u2019s first Enquiry concerning Human\nUnderstanding, and Hume\u2019s theories of the imagination and the\nmoral sentiments, although not his skepticism, would considerably\ninfluence the further development of Sulzer\u2019s own philosophy.\nAlthough Sulzer himself remained at bottom a loyal Leibnizo-Wolffian,\nhis introduction of Hume into German philosophical discourse prepared\nthe way for Kant\u2019s critique of that philosophy. In 1761, Sulzer began\nwork on his General Theory of the Fine Arts, which was\noriginally planned as a revision of Jacques Lacombe\u2019s Dictionnaire\nportraitif des beaux-arts (1752) but became a vehicle for the\nstatement of Sulzer\u2019s own general views about aesthetics and the moral\nsignificance of art as well an outlet for his vast learning and\nenergy. Sulzer finally published the General Theory in two\nvolumes from 1771 to 1774; especially in the expanded posthumous\neditions by Friedrich von Blankenburg in 1786\u201387 and\n1792\u201394 (Sulzer having died in 1779), this remains a\nvaluable source for the aesthetics of the German Enlightenment and especially for its\nbibliography.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s earliest works in aesthetics concerned nature rather than\nart, but already demonstrated his lifelong concern for the moral\nsignificance of aesthetic experience. In his Conversations on the\nBeauties of Nature (Unterredungen \u00fcber die Sch\u00f6nheiten der\nNatur, 1750), which was republished in 1770 together with his\nearlier Moral Thoughts on the Works of Nature (Versuch\neiniger moralischen Gedanken \u00fcber die Werke der Natur, 1745),\nSulzer analyzed the benefits of the enjoyment of natural beauty in a\nway that prefigured his subsequent complex analysis of the value of\nart. In the first conversation he argued that the contemplation of\nnatural beauty has a calming and moderating influence on our\npassions. The remaining conversations argue that the contemplation of\nthe order of nature proves to us that its existence cannot have been a\nmatter of chance, and that its beauty gives us palpable evidence of\nthe wisdom and benevolence of its creator. This analysis foreshadows\nSulzer\u2019s later position that the enjoyment of art is of immediate\nmoral value because it directly contributes to our happiness, which is\nthe ultimate object of morality, and is also of indirect moral value\nbecause it can enliven and thereby make more effective our knowledge\nof the general precepts of morality, and is indeed the best instrument\nfor that end.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s mature aesthetics is firmly grounded in his generally\nLeibnizo-Wolffian metaphysics and psychology as well as in his\nWolffian moral philosophy. The central tenets of his metaphysics and\npsychology are that the human mind is essentially representational, so\nthat desire and will as well as cognition are forms of representation,\nand that the ultimate source of all of our pleasurable sentiments is\nthe unhindered activity of our capacity for representation.\nConversely, the fundamental source of disagreeable sentiments is the\nrestriction of our representational activity. Sulzer\u2019s morality is a\nWolffian form of utilitarianism, according to which the goal of the\nmoral life is happiness. Thus, whatever contributes to happiness is at\nleast prima facie good. Aesthetic experience is a variety of\nfree and unhindered activity of our representational capacity, and\ntherefore produces pleasurable sentiments which are a primary\nconstituent of happiness. In that way, aesthetic experience is of\ndirect moral value. But works of art also enliven our abstract\nknowledge of moral precepts and make them effective on our action, so\naesthetic experience is also of indirect moral value. Sulzer\u2019s\nmorality might seem egocentric, but he forestalls such an objection by\nan argument that normal human beings naturally desire for others what\nthey desire for themselves, and naturally recognize the right of\nothers to that for which they claim a right for themselves\n(\u201cPsychological Considerations,\u201d p.  287). Thus those who\ndesire happiness for themselves naturally desire it for others as\nwell, and those who desire happiness in the form of the pleasure of\naesthetic experience for themselves will naturally desire it for\nothers as well. However, Sulzer also recognizes that art can be put to\nperverse and immoral use as well as healthy and good use, thus while\nart can contribute to morality both directly and indirectly we must\nalso have an independent grasp of and commitment to the fundamental\nprinciples of morality in order to make sure that aesthetic\nexperience\u2019s natural tendency to morally good outcomes is not\nperverted.\n\n\nWorking within the tradition of Wolff and Baumgarten, Sulzer bases his\naesthetics on the premise that the experience of beauty is founded on\nthe sensuous perception of perfection. Perfection consists in the rich\nvariety of a manifold on the one hand and its unity on the other but\nalso in a third element, namely the \u201ccomplete agreement\u201d\nof what a thing is \u201cwith what it ought to be, or of the real\nwith the ideal\u201d (\u201cVollkommenheit\u201d\n(\u201cPerfection\u201d) in Allgemeine Theorie der sch\u00f6nen\nK\u00fcnste, volume IV, pp. 688\u20139, at p. 688).  He thus allows\nfor no conception of perfection without a concept of purpose. Kant\nwill subsequently reject the assumption that we must have a conception\nof the purpose of an object in order to make a (pure) judgment of\nbeauty about it. But Sulzer himself already departs from the purely\nWolffian conception that the experience of beauty consists simply in a\nclear but obscure recognition of the perfection of an object relative\nto a conception of its purpose because he holds that the experience of\nthe beauty of an object is an awareness of its effect on our\nrepresentational faculty rather than an awareness of\nthe cause of that effect in the object. Thus the experience\nof beauty becomes the sensation or sentiment (Empfindung)\ncaused by the perfection of the object, rather than a clear but\nindistinct cognition of that perfection.  The real object of pleasure\nthen becomes the activity of one\u2019s own representational state,\nmanifested in the form of sentiment, that is caused by the perfection\nof the beautiful object. This is Sulzer\u2019s decisive modification of the\nLeibnizo-Wolffian approach to aesthetics, not to be found in\nBaumgarten nor in Herder. However, from this\ninnovation Sulzer does not draw the conclusion that Kant subsequently\nwill, namely, that there can be no general rules for beauty. On the\ncontrary, in his view the causal relation between perfection in the\nobject and the pleasurable sentiments of activity in the subject is\nprecisely the sort of relation that gives rise to rules, although such\nrules will be fairly general rather than very specific.\n\n\nIn holding that the real source of our pleasure in beautiful objects\nis our sensation of our own representational activity Sulzer is led\nto identify aesthetically valuable forms of sentiment that are not\ncaused by beauty at all. In fact, he argues that the fine arts must\narouse the full range of human sentiments, even sentiments of\nugliness (although, unlike Lessing, he does not distinguish among the\nfine arts in this regard) (\u201cH\u00e4\u00dflich\u201d\n(\u201cUgly\u201d), Allgemeine Theorie, volume II,\npp. 457\u20139). But even before he reaches that conclusion, his\ntheory of beauty makes the nature and aims of art more complex than\nthey might initially seem. Sulzer employs a trifold division of\nthings that please us that is not dissimilar to Kant\u2019s subsequent\ndistinction between the agreeable, the good, and the beautiful. He\ndistinguishes between things that please us \u201ceven if we do not\nhave the least conception of the constitution\u201d or means by\nwhich they do that, things that please us only if we have \u201ca\ndistinct representation of their constitution,\u201d and things that\nplease us because \u201cthe constitution of the objects charms our\nattention,\u201d but where we \u201csense a satisfaction in them\nbefore we cognize them distinctly, before we know what they ought to\nbe.\u201d The last of these is what comprise the \u201cclass of the\nbeautiful properly speaking,\u201d while the former\ncorrespond to Kant\u2019s classes of the agreeable and the good\nrespectively (\u201cSch\u00f6n\u201d\n(\u201cBeautiful\u201d), Allgemeine Theorie, volume IV,\npp. 305\u201319, at p. 306). Then Sulzer makes a further\ndistinction. Because of his inclusion of purposiveness in his\nconception of perfection, he argues that the perfect can please us\n\u201ceither because of its material, or because of its external\nform, or through its inner constitution, by means of which it is an\ninstrument or means for the achievement of some final end\u201d\n(ibid., p. 307). Correspondingly, there is a distinction between the\npleasure that we may take in superficial beauty of the form and\nmatter of an object, and the deeper pleasure that we take when an\nobject also has \u201cinner worth.\u201d \u201cA higher species of\nbeauty arises from the close unification of the perfect, the\nbeautiful, and the good. This arouses not merely satisfaction, but\ntrue inner pleasure, which often empowers the entire soul, and the\nenjoyment of which is happiness\u201d (ibid., pp.  309\u201310). On\nSulzer\u2019s account, a beauty that appeals to the full range of our\ncognitive and emotional capacities through its purposiveness as well\nas its form is a \u201chigher species\u201d of beauty than one that\nappeals to our sense of form alone.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s conception of the two levels of beauty also leads him to an\naccount of the \u201cideal of beauty\u201d that may have been a\nsource for Kant\u2019s later discussion of that concept, which will in turn\nbe criticized by Friedrich Schiller (see section 8).  According to\nSulzer,\nthat the human form [Gestalt] is the most\nbeautiful of all visible objects does not need to be proved\u2026The\nstrongest, the most noble, and the most blessed sentiments of which\nthe human mind is capable are effects of this\nbeauty. (\u201cSch\u00f6nheit\u201d\n(\u201cBeauty\u201d), Allgemeine Theorie, volume IV,\npp. 319\u201327, at pp.  319\u201320)\n\n\nThe \u201cexternal form of the inner character\nof a human being\u201d (ibid., p. 322) is the ideal of beauty, when\nthe beauty of that external form expresses the goodness of the\ninternal character; correspondingly, the external expression of inner\nevil is the most hateful form of appearance. Like Herder, Sulzer\nrecognizes that the variety of human tastes in both form and more\nsubstantial matters of morality means that different individuals and\npeoples will find both different external forms beautiful and\ndifferent characters good, thus leading to differences in their ideals\nof beauty. But he is confident of the general principle that\n\u201cevery human being holds that to be most beautiful whose form\nannounces to the eye of the judge the most perfect and best human\nbeing\u201d (ibid., p. 320). This illustrates his general conception\nof the force of rules of taste: they express underlying commonalities\nin the etiology of human preferences without entailing complete\nagreement about particulars.\n\n\nSulzer also develops a complex theory of the value of fine art. Fine\nart aims to produce pleasure both by setting our cognitive powers into\nactivity through the formal and material beauties of its products and\nby arousing our deepest feelings. Since the aim of morality is human\nhappiness, art has immediate moral value just because it sets our\nmental powers into enjoyable activity.  But its ability to arouse our\nemotions also gives art indirect moral value through its capacity to\nenliven and make effective our otherwise abstract and not always\nefficacious acknowledgement of the general precepts of morality. Thus,\nin such a statement as that \u201cthe essence\u201d of art\nconsists in the fact that it impresses the objects\nof our representation with sensible force, its end is the lively\naffection [R\u00fchrung] of our minds, and in its application it\naims at the elevation of the spirit and the heart, (\u201cK\u00fcnste;\nSch\u00f6ne K\u00fcnste\u201d (\u201cArts; Fine Arts\u201d) Allgemeine\nTheorie, volume III, pp. 72\u201395, at p. 75),\n\n\nSulzer clearly indicates that art has immediate\nvalue in its vivification of our sensory and cognitive powers as well\nas the value of its power to elevate our spirit and heart and thereby\nmake morality efficacious for us. To be sure, he often emphasizes the\nlatter aspect of the value of art more than the former; for example,\nhe writes\nThe fine arts also use their charms in order to\ndraw our attention to the good and to affect us with love for it. Only\nthrough this application does it become important to the human race\nand deserve the attention of the wise and the support of\nregents. (ibid., p. 76)\n\n\nIn a time and place where Calvinism and Pietism\nstill questioned the value of the fine arts, it may have been\nnecessary for him to emphasize the value of art for enlivening our\nmoral precepts over his theory that morality itself aims at a kind of\nhappiness in which the pleasures of the fine arts play a direct and\nmajor r\u00f4le. But the latter is as much a part of his thought as the\nformer.\n\n\nSulzer\u2019s more conventional view that the fine arts serve morality by\nenlivening our moral feelings explains his recognition of the value of\nthe ugly as well as the beautiful in art: our sentiments of ugliness\nneed to be aroused in order to strengthen our aversion to the evil\njust as our sentiments of beauty need to be aroused in order to\nstrengthen our attraction to the good. But Sulzer also recognizes that\nthe emotional power of art means that it can be made into a tool for\nevil as well as for good, especially in the political arena. For\nexample, a leader\nwho does not have sufficiently secure power in his\nhands turns to the efforts of his artists in order to clothe his\ntyranny with agreeableness; and by this means the attention of that\npart of the populace which is merely passive is turned away from\nfreedom and directed toward mere entertainment. (\u201cK\u00fcnste; Sch\u00f6ne\nK\u00fcnste,\u201d Allgemeine Theorie, volume III, p.  83)\n\n\nFor this reason, the moral potential of art must\nbe governed by a firm recognition of the fundamental principles of\nmorality itself (ibid., p. 78). Sulzer does not make the mistake of\nthinking that the experience of fine art, valuable as it can be for\nsound morality and politics, can substitute for a direct grasp of\nsound principles of morality and politics. Although his emphasis on\nthe moral potential of the heightened sensitivity\n(Empfindlichkeit) that can be developed through aesthetic\neducation may have been an important source for Schiller, he would\nnot have gone as far as the latter does in his Letters on\nAesthetic Education in suggesting that aesthetic education is\nboth a necessary and sufficient condition for moral regeneration.\n5.3 Herz\n\nSulzer was clearly significant for successors such as Kant and\nSchiller, both for his emphasis on the free activity of the mind in\naesthetic experience and for his complex rather than simplistic\nposition on the relation between art and morality. One other\nimportant aesthetician of the 1770s was also, like Herder, actually a\nstudent of Kant, but his theory would become an unstated target of\nKant\u2019s criticism rather than a source for him. This is Marcus Herz\n(1747\u20131803), Herder\u2019s junior by three years. Remembered by\nphilosophers primarily as the respondent at the defense of Kant\u2019s\ninaugural dissertation On the Form and Principles of the Sensible\nand Intelligible World in 1770 and as the recipient of Kant\u2019s\nletters describing his progress on the Critique of Pure\nReason in the following decade, Herz had a significant career of\nhis own, as a physician and medical writer, as a lecturer on\nphilosophy, and as the author not only of the earliest exposition of\nKant\u2019s philosophy, but also of an independent and important work in\naesthetics.\n\n\nHerz was born to a Jewish scribe and his wife in Berlin in 1747, and\nreceived a traditional talmudic education. At the age of fifteen he\nwas sent to apprentice with a Jewish merchant in K\u00f6nigsberg, but at\nnineteen he matriculated at the university in K\u00f6nigsberg (two years\nafter Herder had left) as a medical student\u2014the only university\ncourse open to Jews in Prussia. Medical students were required to\nstudy modern languages, philosophy, and mathematics, and Herz became a\nloyal student of Kant\u2019s, attending his lectures on logic, metaphysics,\nmoral philosophy, natural law, physics, and physical geography. Kant\u2019s\nselection of the Jewish student for the defense of his inaugural\ndissertation in 1770 was not accepted happily by some members of the\nfaculty, but Kant supported Herz then and always remained loyal to\nhim, even as the student\u2019s views diverged from his own. Shortly after\nthe defense of Kant\u2019s dissertation, Herz left K\u00f6nigsberg without a\ndegree but with an introduction from Kant to Moses Mendelssohn. He\nimmediately became a member of Mendelssohn\u2019s circle, and also resumed\nhis medical studies in Berlin, and then from 1772 to 1774 in Halle,\nwhere he received his doctorate. He then returned to Berlin, where he\nwas appointed to the Jewish hospital. He attended Mendelssohn in his\nfinal illness in 1786. Most of Herz\u2019s publications arose from his\nmedical and scientific practice, and included his Letters to\nDoctors in 1777 and 1784; Outline of All Medical\nSciences in 1782, which was adopted as a textbook in Halle; a\ncompanion to his Berlin lectures on Experimental Physics;\nan Essay on Dizziness in 1786; and a controversial\nessay On Early Burial among the Jews in 1787, in which he\nargued against the current practice among Jews of burial on the day of\ndeath on medical grounds, holding that death could not always be\nconclusively determined within such a short period. In 1782, Herz also\nprovided the German translation of Manasseh ben\nIsrael\u2019s Vindication of the Jews, to which Mendelssohn\nprovided the preface that would in turn lead the way to\nhis Jerusalem of the next year; Herz thus played a role in\nthe genesis of that central text. In 1777 he began offering private\nlectures on philosophy in addition to his medical practice, which were\nwell attended. Herz died on January 19, 1803, a year before his teacher Kant.\n\n\nHerz\u2019s two important philosophical works were his Considerations\nfrom Speculative Philosophy (Betrachtungen aus der\nspekulativen Weltweisheit) of 1771 and his Essay on Taste and\nthe Causes of its Variety (Versuch \u00fcber den Geschmack und die\nUrsachen seiner Verschiedenheit), first published in 1776 and\nthen in an expanded edition in 1790\u2014the same year as\nKant\u2019s Critique of the Power of Judgment.  The contrast\nbetween the two works in aesthetics is interesting, because while some\narguments in Kant\u2019s work can be construed as subtle criticisms of some\nof Herz\u2019s positions, Herz finished even the second edition of his book\nwithout any knowledge of Kant\u2019s criticisms. In general, he remained\ncloser to the Wolffian and Baumgartian theory of beauty and taste that\nhad been transmitted to him through Mendelssohn than to the position\nof his erstwhile teacher Kant, but he also shared Sulzer\u2019s emphasis on\nmental activity and Herder\u2019s emphasis on the social dimension of art\nwhile introducing some novel positions of his own.\n\n\nHerz\u2019s Considerations from Speculative Philosophy, published\nat the age of twenty-four, does not purport to be more than a German\nparaphrase of Kant\u2019s Latin dissertation, but it goes beyond Kant\u2019s\npublished work on a number of points in the treatment of space, time,\nand things in themselves. It also adds a Mendelssohnian argument about\nthe simplicity of the soul, and, most surprisingly, includes a\ndigression on aesthetic judgment that anticipates a central argument\nof his subsequent Essay on Taste. The central arguments of\nthis digression, which comes in Herz\u2019s exposition of Kant\u2019s new theory\nof space and time as the forms of sensibility, are first, that beauty\nis an objective property especially connected to the form of an\nobject, and not a mere sensation or sentiment (Empfindung) in\nthe subject, and second, that there are general principles of\nbeautiful form.  However, form must always be realized in matter, and\nindividuals differ more in their response to matter than to form, so\nthese general principles are objective but not completely determinate,\nthus allowing for differences of taste even though beauty is\nobjective. Kant would subsequently agree that individuals differ in\ntheir response to matter but not to form, but then restrict pure\njudgments of taste to form alone, thus attempting to guarantee\nunanimity of judgments of taste instead of accepting variation as Herz\ndid. Kant\u2019s analysis of pure judgments of taste might thus be seen as\na criticism of Herz\u2019s theory.\n\n\nFive years after the Considerations, Herz developed this\nconception of beauty as objective but yielding only indeterminate\nrules for taste into the far more extensive Essay on Taste.\nHerz begins with what he considers to be a Baumgartian definition of\nbeauty as the appearance of perfection in an object, where perfection\nin turn consists in the unity of a manifold. However, he adds that a\nwork of art also has a Haltung, or expresses an attitude, and\nthat its beauty also depends upon the harmony between the attitude\nexpressed in the work and the goal or purpose of the work. We do not\nattribute purposes to natural objects, he argues, so in their case\nbeauty lies in manifoldness and unity alone, but in human productions\nand therefore in art we always expect and respond to a purpose. Here\nHerz\u2019s analysis anticipates Kant\u2019s differentiation between natural and\nartistic beauty.  He next argues that as natural beauty consists only\nin manifoldness and unity, we respond to it with the play of our\nimagination, which apprehends manifoldness, and reason, which\nrecognizes unity. But as artistic beauty consists in the objective\nfactors of manifoldness, unity, and attitude, the response to artistic\nbeauty depends upon imagination, reason, and the further element of\nfeeling, for response to the attitude of the work. In this analysis,\nHerz stresses that the perception of beauty is not passive, but rather\nactive, because of the r\u00f4le of both imagination and reason. He also\nargues that our pleasure in beauty is ultimately due to the activity\nof our mental powers in its perception, activity being the greatest\nsource of our pleasure. Here Herz clearly aligns himself with\nSulzer. Herz then argues that human beings share their basic\ncapacities of imagination, reason, and feeling, but that there are\nnumerous factors that affect how these general faculties function\nconcretely in different individuals and populations. This explains\ndifferences of taste without undermining the metaphysical objectivity\nof beauty: these differences include variations in freedom of thought,\nreligion, morality, material wealth, climate and regime. Here Herz\u2019s\nthought parallels the contemporary thought of Herder.\n\n\nSome of Herz\u2019s most interesting points and his greatest differences\nwith Kant\u2019s theory of taste emerge in the discussion of the influence\nof morality on taste. Herz argues that the enjoyment of beauty\ncontributes to morality in two ways, directly and indirectly. The\nenjoyment of beauty contributes to morality directly because as a\nsource of mental activity it is a source of happiness, and happiness\nis nothing less than the aim of morality. Here again Herz adopts the\nsame positions as Sulzer. Herz takes a different position than Sulzer\non the indirect moral benefits of art, however, arguing not that the\nexperience of art enlivens moral sentiments that we already have from\nour more abstract recognition of general moral precepts, but rather\nthat the cultivation of taste, which happens only in society,\ncontributes to morality indirectly because it generates feelings of\nsociability that can then support our attempts to be moral.  Although\nKant will not mention Herz\u2019s name in the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, this seems to be the kind of vindication of aesthetic\nexperience that Kant criticizes under the name of an \u201cempirical\ninterest in the beautiful,\u201d holding that morality requires\nan a priori principle rather than mere feelings of\nsociability and can therefore be supported only by an\n\u201cintellectual interest in the beautiful.\u201d\n\n\nFinally, in the appendix to the Essay Herz also argues\nagainst the position of Du Bos that critics have no better rules for\narguing about the merits of works of art than cooks do for arguing\nabout ragouts, a position adopted from Du Bos by Hume and subsequently\nendorsed by Kant. In spite of his recognition of the many factors that\ncreate variability in judgments of taste, Herz thus insisted to the\nend that we can have not just an a priori ideal of agreement\nin taste but rational means for arguing about judgments of taste,\nconsisting in discussion of unity amidst variety on the one hand and\nthe identification of factors leading to disagreement on the other\nhand. In this regard, Herz remained within the ambit of Wolff,\nBaumgarten, and Meier rather than approaching the view of his\ncontemporary Herder. One might nevertheless have expected his emphasis\non the r\u00f4le of individual mental activity in aesthetic experience,\nrather than Herder\u2019s emphasis on truth as the basis of aesthetic\nexperience, to have led to the more radical position on the\npossibility of determinate rules for art criticism.\n6. Moritz: Art as that which is Perfect in itself\n\n\nKarl Philipp Moritz (1756\u20131793) is the last of the pre-Kantian\nGerman aestheticians who will be considered here. Moritz was another\nof the many German intellectuals of the eighteenth century who rose to\nrenown from unpromising beginnings. He was the son of an army musician\nwho sought refuge from his own circumstances in Quietism, an extreme\nsect of Pietism, and inflicted its religiosity upon his son. After\nseveral years as an apprentice to a hatmaker, Moritz was able to\nattend grammar school.  He spent a few years at the\nuniversities in Erfurt and Wittenberg, interspersed with attempts to\nbecome an actor and a stay at the seminary of the Moravian Brothers,\nanother Pietist sect. At twenty-two, he became a schoolteacher in\nBerlin. In 1782 he made a trip to England and published a travelogue\nwhich won him some recognition, after which he returned to his school\nuntil 1786, when his publisher financed a trip to Italy in the hope of\ngetting another popular travelogue out of him. In Italy Moritz became\na friend of Goethe, who would write a much more famous account of his\nItalian journey, and learned enough about classical art to become\nprofessor of aesthetics at the Academy of Arts in Berlin in 1789, the\nposition he held until his death just four years later. Moritz\u2019s\npublications during his brief but intense literary career included, in\naddition to his Italian travelogue, eventually published in\n1792\u20133, the novels Anton Reiser (1786\u201390), a\nbarely fictionalized autobiography, and Andreas Hartknopf: An\nAllegory; philological works including an Essay on German\nProsody in 1786 and Lectures on Style in 1793; textbooks\non grammar and logic for children, a German Grammar for the\nLadies, English and Italian grammars for Germans, and an\neventually very successful account of Greek mythology aimed at both\nchildren and adults; a Theory of Ornament; and a journal of\n\u201cempirical psychology\u201d (erfahrende Seelenkunde)\nthat he edited for ten years. But what concern us here are the essays\nin aesthetics that Moritz published between 1785 and 1791.\n\n\nThese essays commence with the ambitiously entitled \u201cAttempt at\na Unification of all the Fine Arts and Sciences under the Concept\nof that which is complete in itself,\u201d dedicated to\nMoses Mendelssohn and published in 1785 in an issue of\nthe Berlinische Monatsschrift that also contained an article\n(on astronomy) by Kant. In these essays Moritz argues that works of\nart please us because they have an \u201cinternal\npurposiveness\u201d independent of any purpose external to them, a\nconception that might seem to anticipate Kant\u2019s own account of\nbeauty as \u201cpurposiveness without a purpose\u201d and the\nnineteenth-century conception of \u201cart for art\u2019s sake.\u201d It\nis certainly possible that Kant read Moritz\u2019s essay,\nappearing as it did alongside one of his own, but Kant\u2019s notion of\n\u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cformal\u201d purposiveness is\nmore a repudiation of Moritz\u2019s conception of \u201cinternal\npurposiveness\u201d than a successor to it. Moritz\u2019s view is\nalso distinct from later conceptions of \u201cart for art\u2019s\nsake.\u201d In fact, as the brief \u201cOutlines of a Complete\nTheory of the Fine Arts\u201d that he published in the journal of the\nAcademy of Arts in 1789 makes clear, Moritz rejected the\n\u201csubjectivist\u201d view that our pleasure in artistic or\nnatural beauty is due primarily to the way in which it freely engages\nour own mental powers on which the theory of Kant and later advocates\nof \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d is based in favor of an\n\u201cobjectivist\u201d view:\nThe genuinely beautiful is not merely in us and in\nour manner of representation, but is to be found outside us\nin the objects themselves. (\u201cGrundlinien zu einer vollst\u00e4ndigen\nTheorie der sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste,\u201d in Werke, volume II, pp.\n591\u20132, at p. 591)\n\n\nWhat Moritz actually held is that the\n\u201cinternal purposiveness\u201d of a work of art is an\nintimation of the perfection of the world as a whole, and that we\nenjoy it precisely as such an intimation. Thus Moritz attempted to\nstem the growth of the theory of aesthetic experience as free play by\nreverting to a theory of beauty as an intimation of the true order of\nthe cosmos that has its roots in the views of Wolff and\nShaftesbury.\n\n\nBoth the essay on art as \u201cthat which is complete in\nitself\u201d and a longer pamphlet \u201cOn the formative Imitation\nof the Beautiful\u201d (\u00dcber die bildende Nachahmung des\nSch\u00f6nen) that Moritz published in 1788 start off with a contrast\nbetween the beautiful on the one side and the useful and the good on\nthe other in a way that does anticipate the opening stratagem of\nKant\u2019s \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d in his Critique of\nthe Power of Judgment in 1790. Moritz analyses the useful in\nparticular as a means to a perfection that lies outside of the useful\nobject itself, namely,\nthe convenience or comfortableness that accrues to\nmyself or another through the use of it\u2026i.e., I consider it\nmerely as a means, for which I myself, in so far as my perfection is\nthereby promoted, am the end. The merely useful object is thus in\nitself nothing whole or complete.\n\n\nThen he immediately assumes, as if this were the\nonly alternative, that\nIn the contemplation of the beautiful I roll the\nend from myself back into the object itself: I consider it, as\nsomething that is complete not in me but rather in\nitself, that thus comprises a whole in itself, and that affords\nme pleasure on its own account. (\u201c\u00dcber den Begriff\ndes in sich selbst Vollendeten,\u201d Werke, volume\nII, pp. 543\u20138, at p. 543)\n\n\nMoritz continues that a beautiful object does not\nplease us, like a clock or a knife, because it satisfies some need of\nour own, not even the need to be pleased, but, remarkably, that\nthe beautiful needs us, in order to be\ncognized. We could subsist very well without the contemplations of\nbeautiful works of art, but these, as such, cannot well subsist\nwithout our contemplation.\n\n\nHe then goes on to say that when we see a play\nput on before an empty theater, we are displeased, not for the sake of\nthe author or actors, but for the sake of the play itself, as work of\nart whose need to be contemplated is going unfulfilled (ibid.,\np. 544)!\n\n\nIn a passage that points more toward Arthur Schopenhauer than to Kant,\nMoritz next writes:\n\n\nThe sweet astonishment, the agreeable forgetting of ourself\nin the contemplation of a beautiful work of art, is also a proof that\nour gratification here is something subordinate, that we voluntarily\nallow ourself to be determined through the beautiful, to which we for\na while concede a sort of sovereignty over all our own feelings.\nWhile the beautiful draws our consideration entirely to itself, it\ndraws us for a while away from our self, it is the highest degree of\npure and unselfish gratification that the beautiful affords us.  In\nthe moment we sacrifice our individual, limited existence to a sort of\nhigher existence. The gratification in the beautiful must thereby ever\nmore approach that of unselfish love if it is to be\ngenuine\u2026. The beautiful in the work of art is not for me pure\nand unmixed until I completely think away its special relation to me\nand consider it is as something that has been brought forth entirely\nfor its own sake, so that it could be something complete in itself.\n(Ibid., p. 545)\n\n\n\nAs the popularity of Schopenhauer\u2019s subsequent presentation of this\nview demonstrates, Moritz has surely here captured an aspect of the\nexperience of artistic\u2014or for that matter natural\u2014beauty\nthat many people have felt. But so far his conception of and argument\nfor the idea of the beautiful as that which is perfect and complete in\nitself has been entirely negative; what is it in a beautiful object\nthat can so please us and yet distract us completely from our ordinary\nconcern with ourselves and our own pleasures?\n\n\nThe answer to this question can be found in Moritz\u2019s longer\nessay On the formative Imitation of the Beautiful. Here,\nafter a more extended contrast between the beautiful, the useful, and\nthe good, Moritz adds to his previous account that a beautiful object\nis something that seems to us to be \u201ca whole subsisting for\nitself\u201d insofar as it \u201cstrikes our senses or can\nbe grasped by our imagination,\u201d and that \u201cto that\nextent our instruments of sensation prescribe\nits measure to the beautiful\u201d (\u00dcber die bildende\nNachahmung des Sch\u00f6nen, Werke, volume II, pp.\n551\u201378, at pp. 558\u20139). Here he aligns himself with the\ntradition of Wolff and Baumgarten by asserting that the perception of\nbeauty is a perception of perfection by means of the senses or their\nextension through imagination. But he still owes us an explanation of\nwhat the internal and objective perfection of the beautiful object is.\nThis comes next, when he states that it is actually the\n\u201cinterconnection of the whole of nature\u201d insofar as we\ngrasp it by means of the senses and imagination that we contemplate\nand admire in a beautiful work of art, or that it is intimated to us\nby such a work. \u201cEvery beautiful whole from the hand of the\nformative artist is thus a little impression of the highest beauty in\nthe great whole of nature\u201d (ibid., p. 560; see also\n\u201cGrundlinien,\u201d p. 592). The beautiful intimates the true\norder of the world-whole to us in a way that the use of our ordinary\npowers of thought, imagination, and sense on particular pieces of the\nworld-whole cannot do. Only in the experience of the\nbeautiful can we actually get a sense of the order of the\nworld-whole.\n\n\nFrom the premise that \u201cThe nature of the beautiful consists\nprecisely in the fact that its inner essence lies outside of the\nlimits of the power of thought, in its origination, in its own\ncoming-to-be,\u201d Moritz infers that \u201cin the case of the\nbeautiful, the power of thought can no longer ask, why is it\nbeautiful?\u201d (ibid., p. 564). The essence of beauty thus escapes\nordinary conceptual thought. This is the basis for Moritz\u2019s argument,\nin another essay entitled \u201cThe Signature of the\nBeautiful,\u201d that the beautiful cannot be described, that is,\nthat although words themselves may be beautiful, they cannot\nprovide a description of beauty\u2014even such a brilliant\ndescription as Winckelmann\u2019s description of the Apollo Belvedere\n\u201crips apart the wholeness of this work of art,\u201d and\n\u201cis more damaging than useful to the contemplation of this\nsublime work of art\u201d (\u201cDie Signatur des\nSch\u00f6nen,\u201d Werke, volume II, pp. 579\u201388, at p.\n588). And for this reason, the artistic genius cannot be fully\nconscious of what he does when he creates a beautiful work of art, for\nits beauty cannot be reduced to any concept that he can state (ibid.,\np. 585). Here Moritz arrives at results that are superficially similar\nto those Kant will arrive at a few years later\u2014that aesthetic\njudgments cannot be grounded in determinate concept and that the\nprocess of creation by artistic genius cannot be guided and explained\nby determinate concepts. But he reaches these conclusions for very\ndifferent reasons: Kant will draw these conclusions from his\nsubjectivist account of the origin of aesthetic pleasure in a play of\nthe cognitive powers that is free rather than determined by concepts,\nwhile Moritz draws these conclusions from his conception that a\nbeautiful object always intimates the order of the world-whole that is\nbeyond our grasp through any of the ordinary powers of mind. In other\nwords, Moritz draws his conclusions from his version of an aesthetics\nof truth, while Kant will draw similar conclusions from an aesthetics\nbased on the idea of the free play of mental powers.\n\n\nIn 1791, Moritz dedicated a review of the Essay on Taste by\n\u201cour mutual friend\u201d Herz to Salomon Maimon, another\nJewish intellectual who had arisen to prominence in\nBerlin from beginnings even more unpromising than those of Mendelssohn\nand Herz. Here he manifests his own allegiance to Wolff and\nBaumgarten, arguing that his conception of beauty as the internal\nperfection of a work of art as it strikes the senses and imagination\nis essentially the same as their conception of beauty as\n\u201csensible perfection\u201d (he draws no distinction between\nWolff and Baumgarten) (\u201c\u00dcber des Herrn Professor Herz Versuch\n\u00fcber den Geschmack: An Herrn Salomon Maimon,\u201d Werke,\nvolume II, pp. 923\u20137, at p. 925). In this work he also tries to\npaper over any difference between himself and Kant, whose Critique\nof the Power of Judgment had also appeared the year before, by\nclaiming that Kant\u2019s concept of \u201cpurposiveness without purpose\nis nothing other than an ideal purpose,\u201d and thus that Kant\u2019s\nconcept of beauty is essentially the same as Wolff\u2019s and his own\n(ibid., p.  926). This is not true, because Moritz\u2019s conception of the\nbeauty of an individual work of art is that it is an intimation of the\ntrue and objective order of nature as a whole, while Kant\u2019s notion of\npurposiveness without purpose is that of a subjective state of mind in\nwhich our mental powers of imagination and understanding are in a free\nharmony that does not by itself represent anything at all. At least in\nwhat Kant calls the \u201cpure\u201d judgment of taste, the\nexperience of beauty is pleasurable without meaning anything or\nconveying any truth. As we will see, that is in fact only the\nstarting-point of Kant\u2019s aesthetics, although as he moves past his initial\nanalysis of \u201cpure\u201d or \u201cfree\u201d beauty he does\nadd back into his view the beauties of truth that figured so\nprominently for so many of his German predecessors up through Herder\nand Moritz, as well as the beauty of utility that we saw to play a\nlarge r\u00f4le in the British tradition, for example in Hume. But we\ncannot appreciate the complexity of Kant\u2019s aesthetics unless we have\nseen the separate approaches that he ultimately combines.\n7. Kant: Playing with Truth\n\n\nImmanuel Kant\u2019s only significant work in aesthetics, the Critique\nof the Power of Judgment, came late in his life, at the end of\nthe extraordinary decade in which he had published the Critique of\nPure Reason (1781, revised 1787), the Prolegomena to any\nfuture Metaphysics (1783), the Groundwork for the Metaphysics\nof Morals (1785), the Metaphysical Foundations of Natural\nScience (1786), the Critique of Practical Reason (1788),\nand a host of important essays on history, science, and theology as\nwell as philosophy. Although we take its existence for granted now,\nKant\u2019s third Critique could only have struck its original\naudience as a surprising and puzzling work. It was surprising, because\nthe second critique had not announced a forthcoming third anymore than\nthe first had announced that there would be a second; and it was\npuzzling, because the book not only gives an extended treatment to one\ntopic, namely aesthetic experience and judgment, which Kant had\npreviously denied could be the subject of a science (Critique of\nPure Reason, A 21/B 35\u20136), but also links that topic with\nanother, namely the teleological judgment of both organisms within\nnature and of nature as a whole, to which Kant had never before linked\nit. Clearly there must have been some revolution in Kant\u2019s conception\nof the tasks of philosophy as well in his assessment of the prospects\nof both aesthetics and teleology. This change in view both made it\nimperative for him and enabled him to write this book, linking two\nsubjects that were not only disparate but that had also previously\nbeen problematic for him, so soon after having completed his\nexhausting labors on the first two critiques.\n\n\nKant does not immediately reveal a profound motivation for the new\nbook in either the first draft of its Introduction, the so-called\n\u201cfirst introduction\u201d of 1789, or in the Preface or first\nsection of the published Introduction as well as several of its\nsubsequent sections. These are focused on the distinctions among the\nseveral faculties of the mind and the divisions of philosophy. As a\nresult, the introductions make it seem as if Kant has been moved\nprimarily by a pedantic desire for completeness to find a place in his\nsystem for two disciplines, aesthetics and teleology, that had been\ndiscussed by many of his German, British, and French predecessors, but\nthat had apparently not played a large role in his own thought\nheretofore. It seems that the main task of the third Critique\nwill be to introduce the conception of a new class of judgments or new\nuse of the power of judgment, \u201creflecting\u201d\n(reflektierend) judgment, which will subsume the aesthetic\nand teleological judgment and demonstrate both their affinities with\nand differences from the theoretical judgments analyzed and grounded\nin the first Critique and the moral judgments treated in the\nsecond Critique. However, Kant was driven to connect\naesthetic and teleological judgment by a much more profound and\npowerful motivation than that of mere systematic housekeeping. This\ndeeper motivation is first revealed in the second section of the\npublished Introduction. Here Kant claims that there is a substantive\nand important problem that calls for a third critique, namely that\n\n\nAlthough there is an incalculable gulf fixed between the domain of the\nconcept of nature, as the sensible, and the domain of the concept of\nfreedom, as the supersensible, so that from the former to the latter\n(thus by means of the theoretical use of reason) no transition is\npossible, just as if there were so many different worlds, the first of\nwhich can have no influence on the second: yet the\nlatter should have an influence on the former, namely the\nconcept of freedom should make the end that is imposed by its laws\nreal in the sensible world, and nature must consequently also be able\nto be conceived in such a way that the lawfulness of its form is at\nleast in agreement with the possibility of the ends that are to be\nrealized in it in accordance with the laws of freedom. (CPJ,\nIntroduction, section II, 5:174\u20135; see also section IX,\n5:195\u20136)\n\n\n\nThe problem that has apparently not been solved by the earlier two\ncritiques is that of showing that our choice to act in accordance with\nthe moral law, as the fundamental principle of all laws of freedom, a\nchoice that can be free only if it is conceived of as taking place in\na \u201csupersensible\u201d or noumenal realm that is not governed\nby the deterministic laws of \u201csensible\u201d or phenomenal\nnature, where every event is fully determined by chains of causality\nextending far back beyond any particular choice of any particular\nindividual, must nevertheless be efficacious within that phenomenal\nworld, able to transform the natural world into a \u201cmoral\nworld\u201d where people really do act in accordance with the moral\nlaw and the ends that are imposed upon us by that law really can be\nrealized. And the reason for linking aesthetic and teleological\njudgment together in a third critique apparently must be that these\ntwo forms of human experience and judgment together somehow offer a\nsolution to this problem.\n\n\nBut what problem about the efficacy of the laws of freedom in the\nrealm of nature could remain to be solved after the first two\ncritiques? The Critique of Pure Reason had argued that\nalthough we can disprove the possibility of any breach in the\ndeterminism of the natural world and cannot have theoretical knowledge\nof the freedom of our will in the noumenal world, nevertheless we can\ncoherently conceive of the latter. And the Critique of Practical\nReason had argued that we can confidently infer the reality of\nour noumenal freedom to choose to do whatever morality requires of us\nfrom our immediate awareness of our obligation under the moral law\ncombined with the principle that if we ought to do something then we\nmust be able to do it (see Critique of Practical Reason,\n\u00a76, 5:30, and Religion within the Boundaries of Mere\nReason, 6:62, 66\u20137). The second Critique had also\nargued that since morality imposes an end upon us, namely that of\nrealizing the highest good, the greatest happiness consistent with the\ngreatest virtue, we must believe this to be possible, and thus must\npostulate \u201ca supreme cause of nature having a causality in\nkeeping with the moral disposition\u201d (Critique of Practical\nReason, Dialectic, 5:125; translation from Gregor, p. 240). If\nKant has already established that on the basis of our awareness of our\nobligations under the moral law we can be confident that we have free\nwill and that all of the laws of nature are at least consistent with\nour realization of the ends commanded by the moral law, what more\nneeds to be done in order to throw a bridge between the theoretical\ncognition of nature and the laws of freedom?\n\n\nAs both the second critique and the preceding Groundwork for the\nMetaphysics of Morals make clear, Kant clearly recognizes that in\norder to act morally, we need to (i) understand the moral law and what\nit requires of us; (ii) believe that we are in fact free to choose to\ndo what it requires of us rather than to do what all our other\nmotives, which can be subsumed under the rubric of self-love, might\nsuggest to us; (iii) believe that the objectives that morality imposes\nupon us can actually be achieved, and (iv) have an adequate motivation\nfor our attempt to do what morality requires of us in lieu of the mere\ndesirability of particular goals it might happen to license or even\nimpose in particular circumstances. All of these together constitute\nthe conditions of the possibility of morality. Kant also thinks that\nat one level all these conditions are satisfied by pure practical\nreason itself: (i) the very form of pure practical reason gives us the\nmoral law; (ii) the first \u201cfact\u201d of pure practical reason,\nnamely our consciousness of our obligation under this law, implies the\nreality of our freedom to be moral by means of the principle that we\nmust be able to do what we know we ought to do; (iii) we can postulate\nby pure practical reason alone that the laws of nature are compatible\nwith the demands of morality because both laws ultimately have a\ncommon author; and finally (iv) pure respect for the moral law itself\ncan be a sufficient motivation for us to attempt to carry it out (and\nattempts to do so have \u201cmoral worth\u201d only when that is our\nmotivation). But Kant also recognizes that we are sensuous as well as\nrational creatures, and need sensuous as well as rational presentation\nand confirmation of the conditions of the possibility of morality. The\ntask of the third Critique will then be to show how both\naesthetic and teleological experience and judgment provide sensuous\nconfirmation of what we do already know in an abstract way, but also\nneed to feel or make palpable to ourselves, namely the efficacy of our\nfree choice of the fundamental principle of morality in the natural\nworld and the realizability of the objectives which that choice\nimposes upon us, summed up in the concept of the highest\ngood. Specifically, Kant will argue that although in its purest form,\nthe free play of our understanding and imagination that constitutes\nthe experience of natural beauty does not presuppose any\njudgment of moral value, the very fact of the existence of natural\nbeauty appears to confirm that the world is hospitable to our goals,\nespecially our moral goals, while our experiences of natural sublimity\nand artistic beauty both involve the free play of our cognitive\npowers with morally significant ideas, and thus are\ndistinctively aesthetic yet morally significant.\n7.1 Kant\u2019s Theory of Free Play\n\nFollowing the canonical model introduced into eighteenth-century\naesthetics by Burke and transmitted into Germany by Mendelssohn, Kant\ndivides the first half of the Critique of the Power of\nJudgment, the \u201cCritique of the Aesthetic Power of\nJudgment,\u201d into two main parts, the \u201cAnalytic of the\nBeautiful\u201d and the \u201cAnalytic of the Sublime.\u201d But\nKant actually analyzes three main forms of aesthetic\nexperience\u2014the experience of beauty, paradigmatically natural\nbeauty; the experience of the sublime, again paradigmatically of\nsublimity in nature; and the experience of fine art\u2014and each of\nthese forms of aesthetic experience ultimately reveals distinctive\nconnections to morality.\n\n\nStarting from the claim that Francis Hutcheson had made in 1725 and\nMendelssohn reintroduced in 1785, Kant begins his analysis of the\njudgment of taste, that is, our claim that a particular object is\nbeautiful, from the premise that our pleasure in a beautiful object\noccurs independently of any interest in the existence of the object as\nphysiologically agreeable (CPJ, \u00a73, 5:205\u20137) or as\ngood for some purpose expressed by a determinate concept of utility or\nmorality (CPJ, \u00a74, 5:207\u20139). But neither does a\njudgment of taste does not express a merely idiosyncratic association\nof pleasure with an object. Rather, to call an object beautiful is to\nspeak with a \u201cuniversal voice,\u201d to assert that the\npleasure one takes in the object is one that should be felt by anyone\nwho responds to the object, at least under ideal or optimal\ncircumstances, even though \u201cthere can also be no rule in\naccordance with which someone could be compelled to acknowledge\nsomething as beautiful\u201d (CPJ, \u00a78, 5:216). How can\none\u2019s pleasure in an object be independent of its subsumption under\nany determinate concept and its satisfaction of any determinate\ninterest and yet be valid for all who properly respond to the object?\nKant\u2019s answer is that although our pleasure in a beautiful object is\nnot a response to its subsumption under a determinate concept, it is\nan expression of the free play of the cognitive faculties of\nimagination and understanding that such an object induces, and those\ncognitive faculties must in fact work the same way in everyone. His\nunderlying idea is that we experience a beautiful object as having the\nkind of unity that we ordinarily find in objects by subsuming them\nunder a determinate concept, but independently of any such\nsubsumption. Because finding such unity is our ultimate cognitive aim,\nwe take pleasure in this discovery, especially since the unity we find\nmust appear contingent, as it were unexpected, if it is not linked to\nany determinate concept (see CPJ, Introduction VI,\n5:186\u20137).  (This is not to say that we do not subsume an object\nwe find beautiful under any determinate concepts at all; we must if we\nare even to identify the object of our pleasure and judgment of taste\nin any determinate way. Kant\u2019s theory must rather be that when we find\nan object beautiful we experience it as having a degree of unity that\ncannot be explained by any of the determinate concepts under which we\ndo subsume it). Kant thus appeals to the concept of free play, hinted\nat by Mendelssohn and developed further by Sulzer, to solve the\nproblem of taste that was emphasized by British aestheticians such as\nHutcheson and Hume, with whose works Kant was intimately familiar.\n\n\nIn this account, Kant makes two striking assumptions. First, he\nasserts that in \u201cpure\u201d judgments of taste our pleasure in\nbeauty is a response only to the perceptible form of an\nobject, not to any matter or content it may have\u2014for example, in\npictorial arts, \u201cthe drawing is what is\nessential,\u201d while the \u201ccolors that illuminate the\noutline\u2026can\u2026enliven the object in itself for sensation,\nbut cannot make it\u2026beautiful\u201d (CPJ, \u00a714,\n5:225). Second, he assumes that the cognitive faculties of all human\nbeings work the same way, that is, respond to particular objects in\nthe same way, even when they are in \u201cfree play\u201d rather\nthan at serious work. The second of these claims seems indefensible,\nbut Kant never backs off from it. The first of these claims also seems\nunjustifiable, but this time Kant modifies his claim almost as soon as\nhe makes it. While he continues to maintain that in pure judgments of\ntaste our pleasure is in the unity of the form of the object alone, he\nquickly recognizes that there are a variety of impure forms\nof beauty where what we respond to with the free play of our\nimagination and understanding is harmony between an object\u2019s\nperceptible form and its matter, its content, or even its\npurpose. Thus, just two sections after his assertion of formalism,\nKant introduces the category of \u201cadherent beauty,\u201d which\nis the kind of harmony between an object\u2019s form and its intended\nfunction that pleases us in a beautiful summer-house or racehorse; and\nhe will subsequently assume that successful works of fine art normally\nhave intellectual content and please us in virtue of the harmony among\ntheir content, form, and material.\n\n\nHowever, Kant interposes his analysis of the experience of the sublime\nbetween his initial analysis of pure beauty and his later analysis of\nfine art. Again following a hint that we have already found in\nMendelssohn, Kant recognizes two forms of the sublime: the\n\u201cmathematical\u201d and the \u201cdynamical.\u201d Our\nexperience of both is a mixture of pain and pleasure, a moment of pain\ndue to an initial sense of the limits of imagination followed by\npleasure at the recognition that it is our own power of reason that\nreveals the limits of our imagination. The mathematical sublime\ninvolves the relationship between imagination and theoretical reason,\nwhich is the source of our idea of the infinite; our experience of\nthis form of the sublime is triggered by the observation of natural\nvistas so vast that our effort to grasp them in a\nsingle image is bound to fail, but which then pleases us\nbecause this very effort of the imagination reminds us that we have a\npower of reason capable of formulating the idea of the\ninfinite (CPJ, \u00a726, 5:254\u20135).\n\n\nKant holds that in this experience we do not just infer that\nwe have such a faculty, but actually experience \u201ca\nfeeling that we have pure self-sufficient reason\u201d (CPJ,\n\u00a727, 5:258). In the case of the dynamical sublime, what we\nexperience is a harmony between our imagination and practical\nreason. This experience is induced by natural objects that seem not\njust vast, but overwhelmingly powerful and\nthreatening\u2014volcanoes, raging seas, and the like (CPJ,\n\u00a728, 5:261.  Kant\u2019s examples were all commonplaces in the\neighteenth century, going back to Joseph Addison\u2019s illustrations of\n\u201cgrandeur\u201d in Spectator 412, June 1712). Here we\nexperience fear at the thought of our own physical injury or\ndestruction followed by the satisfying feeling that we have\nwithin ourselves a capacity for resistance of\nquite another kind, which gives us the courage to measure ourselves\nagainst the apparent all-powerfulness of nature,\n\n\nnamely,\nour power (which is not part of nature) to regard\nthose things about which we are concerned (goods, health and life) as\ntrivial, and hence to regard its power (to which, to be sure, we are\nsubjected in regard to these things) as not the sort of dominion over\nourselves and our authority to which we would have to bow if it came\ndown to our highest principles and their affirmation or\nabandonment. (CPJ, \u00a728, 5:262)\n\n\n\nNow we can turn to Kant\u2019s analysis of fine art and our experience of\nit. For Kant, all art is intentional human production that requires\nskill or talent, yet fine or \u201cbeautiful\u201d (sch\u00f6ne)\nart is produced with the intention of doing what anything beautiful\ndoes, namely, promoting the free play of the cognitive powers. That a\nwork of fine art must be the product of intention and yet\nproduce the free play of the mental powers seems like the\nparadox that \u201cbeautiful art, although it is certainly\nintentional, must nevertheless not seem intentional\u201d\n(CPJ, \u00a745, 5:306\u20137). Further, Kant also assumes\nthat although our pleasure in beauty should be a response to\nthe form of an object alone, fine art is paradigmatically\nmimetic, that is, has representational or semantic content\n(CPJ, \u00a748, 5:311). This too seems like a paradox. Kant\naims to resolve both of these apparent paradoxes through his theory\nthat successful works of fine art are products of genius, a natural\ngift that gives the rule to art (CPJ, \u00a746, 5:307). A\nwork of genius must have \u201cspirit,\u201d which it gets through\nits content, typically\u2014as Kant assumes without argument,\nalthough perhaps in his time, long before the invention of\nnon-objective art, without any real need for argument\u2014a rational\nidea, indeed an idea relevant specifically to morality. But in order\nto be beautiful, a work of art must still leave room for the freedom\nof the imagination, and therefore cannot present such ideas to us\ndirectly and didactically (indeed, such ideas cannot be\ndirectly and adequately presented in sensible form). Instead, a work\nof art succeeds when it presents an \u201caesthetic idea,\u201d a\nrepresentation of the imagination that \u201cat least strive[s]\ntoward something lying beyond the bounds of experience, and thus\nseek[s] to approximate a presentation of the concepts of\nreason.\u201d A successful work of art also \u201cstimulates so much\nthinking,\u201d such a wealth of particular \u201cattributes\u201d\nor images and incidents, \u201cthat it can never be grasped in a\ndeterminate concept\u201d (CPJ, \u00a749,\n5:314\u201315)\u2014thereby stimulating a pleasurable feeling of\nfree play among the imagination, understanding, and reason while at\nthe same time satisfying the demand that a work of art have both a\npurpose and a content.\n7.2 The Moral Significance of the Aesthetic\n\nWe can now see how Kant thinks that our aesthetic experiences and\njudgments can bridge the gulf between our abstract, intellectual\nunderstanding of the requirements and conditions of morality and a\npalpable, sensuous representation of those requirements and\nconditions. Kant suggests six links between the aesthetic and moral,\nwhich together make palpable the satisfaction of the four conditions\nof the possibility of morality that were noted in the introduction to\nthe present section.\n\n\nFirst, Kant evidently holds that objects of aesthetic experience can\npresent morally significant ideas to us without sacrificing what is\nessential to them as objects of aesthetic response and judgment.  This\nis obvious in the theory of aesthetic ideas, where Kant indeed assumes\nthat works of art always have some morally relevant content. But this\nview takes other forms as well. In fact, Kant maintains that all forms\nof beauty, natural as well as artistic, can be regarded as expressions\nof aesthetic ideas: even natural objects can suggest moral ideas to us\nalthough such suggestion is not the product of any intentional human\nactivity (CPJ, \u00a751, 5:319). In \u201cThe Ideal of\nBeauty,\u201d Kant also maintains that beauty in the human figure can\nbe taken as \u201cthe visible expression of moral ideas, which\ninwardly govern human beings\u201d; here he argues that only human\nbeauty can be taken as a unique standard for beauty, because it is the\nonly form of beauty that can express something absolutely and\nunconditionally valuable, namely the moral autonomy of which humans\nalone are capable. At the same time he holds there is no determinate\nway in which this unique value can be expressed in the human form,\nthus there is always something free in the outward expression in the\nhuman figure of the inner moral value of the human character\n(CPJ, \u00a717, 5:235\u20136).\n\n\nThe second link is Kant\u2019s claim that the aesthetic experience of the\ndynamical sublime is nothing other than a feeling of the power of our\nown practical reason to accept the pure principle of morality and to\nact in accordance with it in spite of all the threats or inducements\nto do otherwise that nature might place in our way. Because the\nexperience of the dynamical sublime so centrally involves an\nintimation of our own capacity to be moral, Kant actually insists that\n\u201cthe sublime in nature is only improperly so called, and should\nproperly be ascribed only to the manner of thinking, or rather its\nfoundation in human nature\u201d (CPJ, \u00a730, 5:280). And\nwhile he does not want to claim that this experience is identical to\nexplicit moral reasoning, but only a \u201cdisposition of the mind\nthat is similar to the moral disposition\u201d (CPJ, General\nRemark following \u00a729, 5:268), he does in at least one place argue\nthat the complex character of the experience of the sublime makes it\nthe best representation in our experience of our moral situation\nitself (CPJ, General Remark following \u00a729, 5:271).\n\n\nHowever, Kant elsewhere argues, third, that there are crucial aspects\nof our moral condition that are symbolized by the beautiful rather\nthan the sublime. He claims that the beautiful is the symbol of the\nmorally good because there are significant parallels between our\nexperience of beauty and the structure of morality.  Indeed, he\ninsists that it is only insofar as the beautiful is the symbol of the\nmorally good that we have any right not merely to predict that under\nideal circumstances others should agree with our appraisals of beauty\nbut actually to demand that they do so (CPJ, \u00a759,\n5:353). Kant adduces \u201cseveral aspects of this analogy,\u201d\nthe most important of which is that\nThe freedom of the imagination (thus of\nthe sensibility of our faculty) is represented in the judging of the\nbeautiful as in accord with the lawfulness of the understanding (in\nthe moral judgment the freedom of the will is conceived as the\nagreement of the latter with itself in accordance with universal laws\nof reason). (CPJ, \u00a759, 5:354)\n\n\nBecause the experience of beauty is an experience\nof the freedom of the imagination in its play with the understanding,\nit can be taken as a palpable symbol of the freedom of the will to\ndetermine itself by moral laws that is necessary for morality but not\nitself something that can be directly experienced. In other words, it\nis the very independence of aesthetic response from direct\ndetermination by concepts, including moral concepts, that makes the\nexperience of beauty an experience of freedom that can in turn\nsymbolize moral freedom. Presumably this can be reconciled with\nKant\u2019s earlier claim that the sublime is the most appropriate symbol\nof morality by observing that while the experience of beauty makes\nthe freedom of the will palpable to us, it is only the mixed\nexperience of the sublime that brings home to feeling that this\nfreedom must often be exercised in the face of resistance offered by\nour own inclinations.\n\n\nKant\u2019s fourth connection between the aesthetic and the ethical lies in\nhis theory of the \u201cintellectual interest\u201d in the\nbeautiful. Here Kant argues that although our basic pleasure in a\nbeautiful object must be independent of any antecedent interest in its\nexistence, we may add a further layer of pleasure to that basic\nexperience if the existence of beautiful objects suggests some more\ngenerally pleasing fact about our situation in the world.  Kant\u2019s\nclaim is that since it is of interest to practical reason that nature\nbe hospitable to its objectives, we take pleasure in any\nevidence that nature is amenable to our objectives, even when those\nare not specifically moral; and the natural existence of beauty is\nsuch evidence, because the experience of beauty is itself an\nunexpected fulfillment of our most basic cognitive\nobjective.\n\n\nKant\u2019s fifth claim is that aesthetic experience is conducive to proper\nmoral conduct itself. In his concluding comment on his analyses of\nboth the beautiful and the sublime he states that \u201cThe beautiful\nprepares us to love something, even nature, without interest; the\nsublime, to esteem it, even contrary to our (sensible) interest\u201d\n(CPJ, General Remark following \u00a729, 5:267), where being\nable to love without any personal interest and to esteem even contrary\nto our own interest are necessary preconditions of proper moral\nconduct. Kant makes a similar point in his later Metaphysics of\nMorals (1797) when he argues that \u201ca propensity to wanton\ndestruction of what is beautiful in inanimate nature,\u201d\neven though we do not owe any moral duties directly to anything other\nthan ourselves and other human beings, nevertheless\nweakens or uproots that feeling in [us] which,\nthough not of itself moral, is still a disposition of sensibility that\ngreatly promotes morality or at least prepares the way for it: the\ndisposition, namely, to love something (e.g., beautiful crystal\nformations, the indescribable beauty of plants) even apart from any\nintention to use it. (Metaphysics of Morals, Doctrine of\nVirtue \u00a717, 6:643; Gregor, p. 564)\n\n\n\nSixth and finally, in the brief \u201cAppendix on the methodology of\ntaste,\u201d Kant suggests that the cultivation or realization of\ncommon standards of taste in a society can be conducive to the\ndiscovery of the more general \u201cart of the reciprocal\ncommunication of the ideas of the most educated part\u201d of a\nsociety \u201cwith the cruder, the coordination of the breadth and\nrefinement of the former with the natural simplicity and originality\nof the latter\u201d (CPJ, \u00a760, 5:356), where this art\nis apparently necessary to the realization of the goal of\n\u201clawful sociability,\u201d or the establishment of a\nstable polity on the basis of principles of justice rather than sheer\nforce. Thus, aesthetic experience can be conducive to the development\nof sound politics as well as personal ethics, although the two are of\ncourse not unconnected, since Kant is a political moralist who\nbelieves that we have a moral duty to establish a just state, not\nmerely a prudential interest in doing so.\n\n\nThese six links between aesthetics and morality satisfy the four\nconditions that need to be met in order to bridge the gulf between\nnature and freedom by making our abstract grasp of the contents and\nconditions of morality palpable to our sensuous nature. In particular,\n(i) the presentation of moral ideas in objects of natural and artistic\nbeauty and especially in beautiful human form itself provides sensuous\nillustration of moral ideas, above all the foundational idea of the\nunconditional value of human freedom itself; (ii) the experiences of\nthe dynamical sublime and of the beautiful in their different ways\nboth confirm our abstract recognition of our own freedom always to\nchoose to do as morality requires; (iii) the intellectual interest in\nthe beautiful provides sensuous confirmation of nature\u2019s amenability\nto our objectives, which is otherwise only a postulate of pure\npractical reason; and (iv) the claims that the experiences of the\nbeautiful and the sublime and the sharing of these feelings among\ndifferent strata of highly diversified societies are conducive to the\nrealization of morality reveal ways in which our natural sensuous\ndispositions can be used as means to the realization of the goal set\nby our purely rational disposition to be moral.\n8. Schiller\u2019s Response to Kant\u2019s Aesthetics: Grace, Dignity, and Aesthetic Education\n\nIn the history of ethics as well as aesthetics, mention of Kant is\noften quickly followed by mention of Friedrich Schiller\n(1759\u20131805), who criticized and developed Kant\u2019s views in both\nareas. Perhaps best known to the general public as the author of the\n\u201cOde to Joy\u201d (An die Freude) that provides the\ntext for the fourth movement of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth\nSymphony, as well as the source of materials for operas by Rossini\nand Verdi, in his lifetime Schiller was famous not only as a poet but\nalso as a dramatist, historian, and (at least during the first half\nof the 1790s ) as an aesthetician and philosopher. As a student in\nthe military college of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg he trained as a\nphysician, and his earliest writings were on the mind-body\nrelationship. But he achieved instant fame with his play The\nRobbers (Die R\u00e4uber) in 1782, and then had to flee\nW\u00fcrttemberg in order to continue writing plays. Between 1783 and\n1787, he wrote Fiesko, Intrigue and Love\n(Kabale und Liebe), and Don Carlos. He met Goethe\nin 1787, and was professor of history in nearby Jena from 1789 to\n1799. During this period he wrote histories of the Thirty\nYears\u2019 War and the Dutch revolt against Spain. But he also\ndevoted several years in the early 1790s to an intensive study of\nKant, which then led to a series of essays including \u201cOn Grace\nand Dignity\u201d (\u00dcber Anmut und W\u00fcrde, 1793), Letters\non the Aesthetic Education of Mankind (1795), and \u201cOn\nNa\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry\u201d (1795\u20136), as well as the\nunpublished \u201cKallias\u201d letters on aesthetics (1793). After\nthis period, Schiller returned to his original calling, writing the\nhistorical dramas Wallenstein (1798\u20139), Maria\nStuart (1800), The Maiden of Orleans (Die Jungfrau\nvon Orleans, 1801), The Bride of Messina (1803),\nand Wilhelm Tell (1804). Like so many of the others who have\nbeen discussed here (Baumgarten, Sulzer, Herz, Moritz) his life was\ncut short by lung disease, presumably tuberculosis, and he died at\nforty-five in 1805.\n\n\nSchiller\u2019s \u201cKallias\u201d letters, written to his friend\nGottfried K\u00f6rner in January and February of 1793, were not\nhistorically influential, since they were not published for another\nhalf-century, but are fascinating reading today. In them Schiller\nargues that Kant\u2019s \u201csubjectivist\u201d conception of free play\nin aesthetic response has to be complemented with an\n\u201cobjectivist\u201d conception of beauty as the appearance of\nfreedom or self-determination in the object: a beautiful form\nis one that appears to us to be determined not by any forces outside\nof it but only by itself. For that reason \u201cA form is beautiful,\none might say, if it demands no explanation, or if\nit explains itself without a concept\u201d\n(\u201cKallias\u201d letter of 18 February 1793, p. 155).  Although\nSchiller does not mention his name, his theory could also be\ninterpreted as an attempt to refine Moritz\u2019s conception of beauty as\nthat which is complete within itself. Had Kant known these letters,\nhowever, he could have replied that Schiller\u2019s notions\nof appearing to be self- rather than other-determined\nand demanding no explanation are still subjective, that is,\nthey characterize how we respond to beautiful objects rather\nthan designating any properties that could be attributed to objects\nindependently of our response to them.\n\n\nUnlike the \u201cKallias\u201d letters, Schiller\u2019s essay \u201cOn\nNa\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry\u201d was immediately influential. Here\nSchiller describes the difference between \u201cna\u00efve\u201d and\n\u201csentimental\u201d art. The former is an expression of an\nimmediate emotional response to nature, where nature is thought of as\n\u201cthe subsistence of things on their own, being there according\nto their own immutable laws\u201d (a conception of nature that\nderives from the conception of beauty in the \u201cKallias\u201d\nletters). The latter self-consciously expresses a sense of our own\nseparation from nature and a feeling that the self-subsistent things\nin nature \u201care what we were\u201d and\n\u201cwhat we should become once more\u201d (\u201cNa\u00efve\nand Sentimental Poetry,\u201d pp.  180\u20131), or a longing for a\nwholeness with nature that we think humans once had but that we have\nlost. Schiller identifies na\u00efve poetry with antiquity and sentimental\npoetry (and the sense of alienation from nature it expresses) with\nmodernity.  This essay can be seen as the source for the genre of\nphilosophical histories of aesthetics that then flourished for several\ndecades, beginning with Friedrich Schlegel\u2019s \u201cOn the Study of\nGreek Poetry\u201d of 1797, continuing with Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph\nSchelling\u2019s lectures on The Philosophy of Art of\n1802\u20133, and culminating in the lectures on \u201cPhilosophy of\nArt or Aesthetics\u201d that Hegel gave in Berlin during the\n1820s\u2014lectures that decisively changed the sense of the name\n\u201caesthetics\u201d itself from its original meaning of a general\nscience of sensibility that included responses to nature as well as\nart to its modern meaning as the philosophy of art.\n\n\nHowever, the two theoretical works by Schiller with which philosophers\nhave most concerned themselves have been the 1793 essay \u201cOn\nGrace and Dignity\u201d and the epistolary series On the\nAesthetic Education of Man, first written as an actual series of\nletters to Schiller\u2019s patron the Danish Duke of Augustenberg in 1793\nand then rewritten for publication in 1795. These have typically been\nread as responses to Kant\u2019s moral philosophy, inspired by Kant in\ntheir general concern for autonomy as the essence of morality but\ncriticizing Kant for giving inadequate consideration to the r\u00f4le of\nsensibility in morality. \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d has been\nheld to argue, in supposed opposition to Kant, for the necessity of\ndeveloping feelings as part of what it takes to comply fully with the\ndemands of morality, while Aesthetic Education has been read\nto argue that only the cultivation of aesthetic experience can\ntransform individuals and their society as morality demands; the first\nof these can be considered a constitutive claim, and the second a\ncausal claim. It will be argued here, on the contrary, that Kant\nactually makes greater claims for the significance and contribution of\nboth moral sentiments and aesthetic responses to the individual\nachievement of morality than Schiller does. Specifically, while\n\u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d argues that the moral determination\nof the will should be accompanied with certain moral sentiments on\nwhat are essentially aesthetic grounds, Kant argues that the\nvirtuous determination of the will should be accompanied by certain\nmoral sentiments on moral grounds. And while Aesthetic\nEducation asserts that the development of taste is a necessary\ncondition for the development of individual morality and social\njustice, which Kant never does, the variety of links that Kant\nrecognizes between aesthetics and morality, described in section\n7.2. above, show that the cultivation of taste can make a broader\ncontribution to the realization of morality than Schiller\nrealizes.\n8.1 Kant and Schiller on Beauty, Grace, and Dignity\n\nWe may begin with a different point about \u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d however, namely that it is not primarily an essay in\nmoral theory at all, but an essay in aesthetics, that is, an essay\nabout the expression of moral qualities in the appearance of\nactual human beings. In this regard it is not a critique of\nKantian moral theory but a critique of an aspect of\nKantian aesthetics, namely Kant\u2019s theory of the \u201cideal\nof beauty\u201d in the \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d in\nthe Critique of the Power of Judgment. Schiller\u2019s use of the\nexpression \u201cideal of beauty\u201d very early in his essay\nsignals that this is his primary target (\u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d NA 253; Curran 126).\n\n\nKant introduces the concept of the \u201cideal of beauty\u201d in\nthe third moment of the \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful,\u201d which\ndiscusses the various relations that obtain between beauty and\npurposiveness. Kant begins the third moment by arguing that in its\npurest form the judgment of taste is a response to the mere appearance\nof the form of purposiveness in an object, as opposed to any actual\npurposiveness, in either of the senses of that concept, namely,\nactually serving some specific purpose or having been designed to\nserve some purpose. Correspondingly, Kant equates pure beauty with the\nmere form or appearance of purposiveness rather than with actual\npurposiveness. However, as we saw in section 7.1, Kant complicates his\nanalysis by recognizing forms of beauty that are not pure but are\nconnected with (although not reducible to) the recognition of actual\npurposiveness. The first of these forms is \u201cadherent\nbeauty,\u201d a beauty of form that is consistent with or appropriate\nfor the actual purpose of an object that clearly has a purpose that\nconstrains its possible form in various ways, such as an arsenal or a\nrace horse. Then Kant comes to the \u201cideal of beauty,\u201d or\n\u201cthe highest model, the archetype of taste\u2026in accordance\nwith which [anyone] must judge everything that is an object of\ntaste,\u201d a representation of an individual object or particular\ntype of object that is maximally beautiful (CPJ, \u00a717,\n5:232).\n\n\nKant signals that the search for an ideal of beauty is not something\ninitiated by the logic of taste as such but by something external to\ntaste, namely, the faculty of reason: the \u201carchetype of\ntaste\u2026rests on reason\u2019s indeterminate idea of a maximum.\u201d\nKant argues that\nthe beauty for which an idea [or ideal] is to be\nsought cannot be a vague beauty, but there must be a\nbeauty fixed by a concept of objective purposiveness,\nconsequently it must not belong to the object of an entirely pure\njudgment of taste, but rather to one of a partly intellectualized\njudgment of taste. (CPJ, \u00a717, 5:232\u20133)\n\n\nThis means that the ideal of beauty is a species\nof adherent rather than free beauty. Kant then argues that there are\ntwo elements in such an ideal, namely a uniquely valuable purpose or\nend and a uniquely appropriate aesthetic expression of this purpose\nor end. \u201cThe human being alone is capable of an ideal\nof beauty,\u201d Kant then argues, because \u201cthe\nhumanity in his person, as intelligence, is alone among all the\nobjects in the world capable of the ideal\nof perfection\u201d (ibid., 5:233).  That is, according to\n(practical) reason the human being is the only thing of unconditional\nvalue. But for this ideal to be an ideal of beauty, the unique moral\nvalue of humanity must find an outward expression which is somehow\nappropriate for it although it is not connected to it in accordance\nwith any rule. This expression is found in the beauty of the\n\u201chuman figure,\u201d which is associated \u201cwith\nthe morally good in the idea of the highest\npurposiveness\u2014goodness of soul, or purity, or strength, or\nrepose, etc.\u201d\u2014not in accordance with any rule but simply\nby \u201cgreat force of the imagination\u201d (ibid., 5:235).\nImagination is in fact doubly involved: first, because there is no\nway to derive what counts as beauty in the human figure from mere\nconcepts or by any mechanical process (that could yield only\n\u201ccorrectness in the presentation of the species\u201d), so the\nideal of maximum beauty can only be created by an act of the\naesthetic imagination; and second, because there is no rule that says\nthat moral value must be expressed in outward appearance or that\noutward appearance can be interpreted as an expression of moral\nvalue, but that association too must be created by the\nimagination.\n\n\nSchiller\u2019s first goal in \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d is to show\nthat Kant\u2019s account of the ideal of beauty is not sufficiently precise\nin its account of what aspects of human beauty can be taken as an\nexpression of the moral condition of a human being. He also contends\nthat Kant\u2019s account does not offer an adequate explanation of why any\nfeatures of the outward appearance should be taken as an expression of\nmoral condition. More specifically, Schiller argues that there are two\ndifferent moral conditions of human beings, grace and dignity, and\nthese naturally find different external expressions in the appearance\nof human beings, and by implication in the artistic representation or\nmimesis of them. As a result, the ideal of beauty is more complicated\nthan Kant recognizes. Moreover, there are good reasons why these moral\nconditions should find external expression, so the connection between\nmoral condition and aesthetic result is much less arbitrary than Kant\nmakes it seem.\n\n\nOn Schiller\u2019s account, Kant\u2019s first mistake is to locate the ideal of\nbeauty vaguely in the human figure rather than specifically\nin the bodily accompaniments of intentional actions that are\nthe products of the human will, which, according to Kant\nhimself, is the primary locus of moral value. This also means that it\nis a mistake for Kant to suggest, if that is what he means, that the\nideal of beauty can be found in a general type of human being rather\nthan in particular human beings, for actions are always done by\nparticular human beings. Kant is of course committed to the general\nthesis that beauty is always a property of a particular, but it might\nbe argued that he has lost sight of that commitment when he locates\nthe ideal of beauty in something as general as \u201cthe human\nfigure\u201d as the expression of human morality. Schiller argues\nthat the \u201carchitectonic beauty of the human form,\u201d that\nis, the fixed configuration of the features of a person\u2019s appearance,\n\u201ccomes directly from nature and is formed by the rule of\nnecessity\u201d (\u201cOn Grace and Dignity,\u201d NA 255; Curran\n127), and thus cannot plausibly be taken as an expression of the moral\ncharacter or condition of a person, which is determined by the\nperson\u2019s will or free choice. Any aspect of beauty that can be\ninterpreted as an expression of moral condition must thus be found in\nthe voluntary actions of particular persons rather than in\ntheir fixed features. More specifically, grace, as a condition in\nwhich a person is not merely committed to doing what morality requires\nas a matter of principle but is also so committed to doing this that\nit has become part of his character and thus seems as much natural as\nvoluntary, is revealed in the motions that accompany a\nperson\u2019s directly willed actions but are not themselves consciously\nwilled (\u201cOn Grace and Dignity,\u201d NA 167; Curran 136). For\nexample,\none can deduce from a person\u2019s words how he\nwould like to be viewed, but what he really is must\nbe guessed from the gestures accompanying the speech, in other words,\nfrom the uncontained movements. (\u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d NA 268; Curran 137)\n\n\nIt is in the unintentional accompaniments of\nintentional actions that we can discern people\u2019s real commitment to\nwhat they are doing and the ease with which they make that\ncommitment; the latter is grace, and thus the movements that express\nthat are the expression of grace. Grace can be expressed in the\n\u201crigid and restful features\u201d of an individual\u2019s\nphysiognomy only insofar as those features themselves \u201cwere\noriginally nothing other than movements that through frequent\nrepetition became habitual and left lasting traces\u201d (\u201cOn\nGrace and Dignity,\u201d NA 264; Curran 134).\n\n\nThe next part of Schiller\u2019s aesthetic argument against Kant is that\ndignity is a different moral condition than grace, and that it\ntherefore naturally finds a different outward expression. While grace\nis the expression of a condition in which there is no tension between\na person\u2019s moral commitments and his desires, and where there is thus\nharmony between the explicitly willed aspects of his intentional\nmotions and the instinctive aspects of them, dignity is the sensible\nexpression of successfully willing to act in accordance with moral\nprinciples even at the cost of the suppression of conflicting desires\nand feelings, and is therefore manifest in quite different aspects of\nappearance than grace is. In a person expressing dignity rather than\ngrace,\nwhile his veins swell, his muscles become cramped\nand taut, his voice cracks, his chest is thrust out, and his lower\nbody pressed in, his intentional movements are gentle, the facial\nfeatures relaxed, and the eyes and brow serene\u2026.this\ncontradiction of signs demonstrates the existence and influence of a\npower independent of suffering and above the impressions to which we\nsee the sensuous succumb. And in this way, peace in\nsuffering, in which dignity actually consists, becomes the\nrepresentation of intelligence in human beings and the expression\ntheir moral freedom. (\u201cOn Grace and Dignity,\u201d; NA\n295\u20136; Curran 159\u201360)\n\n\nAs Schiller sums up, \u201cGrace, then, lies in\nthe freedom of intentional movements, dignity in\nthe mastery of instinctive ones\u201d (\u201cOn Grace and\nDignity,\u201d NA 297; Curran 160). Grace expresses a tendency to\nact as morality requires that has become instinctive, while dignity\nexpresses mastery grounded on moral principles over instincts that\nare not harmonious with morality. These are two different moral\nconditions, and thus find two different forms of visible\nexpression.\n\n\nAlthough Schiller\u2019s illustration of both grace and dignity refer to\nour perceptions of actual human beings rather than to artistic\nrepresentations of them, that is not an objection to reading his\naccount as a critique of Kant\u2019s conception of the ideal of beauty. In\nthe \u201cAnalytic of the Beautiful\u201d Kant himself is talking\nprimarily about the beauty of nature rather than art, and in the\nsection on the ideal of beauty he is clearly talking about a special\nfeature of human beauty itself rather than of the artistic\nrepresentation of human beauty. Any implications of either Kant\u2019s\naccount or of Schiller\u2019s critique of it for the case of artistic\nrepresentation would have to be inferred. But of course many of the\nfeatures in which Schiller locates both grace and dignity could be\nrepresented in artistic depictions of human beings, and that is why it\nis not implausible to suggest that his account may be directed against\nLessing as well as Kant. Schiller\u2019s contrast between swelling veins,\ncramped muscles, and outhrust chest on the one hand and serenity of\neye and brow on the other could be taken as a plausible description of\nthe famous statue of Laoco\u00f6n, and thus Schiller could be read as\nsuggesting, in the spirit of Winckelmann, that the statue should be\nunderstood as an expression of dignity in the face of suffering rather\nthan as a symbol for the differences between pictorial and verbal\ndepiction.  On Schiller\u2019s account, however, the dignity of the\nunnamed Laoco\u00f6n would be explained by the moral character of the\nindividual, not by the circumstances of a whole people.\n\n\nAs earlier mentioned, \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d has\ntraditionally been read as a critique of Kant\u2019s moral theory rather\nthan of his aesthetics, arguing for greater moral significance for\nfeelings in line with our principled commitment to morality than Kant\nacknowledges. It looks as if Schiller holds that the ideal for moral\nconduct is that complete attunement between the determination of the\nwill by moral principles and our natural and instinctive desires and\ninclinations that is expressed in grace. Further, it seems that this\nis only because he recognizes that such attunement will not always be\npossible for human beings that he admits that there is sometimes a\nneed for that mastery over refractory feelings that expresses itself\nin dignity\u2014but only as a fall-back or second-best state of\ncharacter, rather than, as Kant seems to suppose, the norm for the\nhuman moral condition. \n\n\nThis is a misreading of the positions of both Schiller and Kant,\nhowever. For Schiller, that complete attunement of principle and\nfeeling that expresses itself in grace is indeed an imperative, but\nan aesthetic demand rather than a strictly moral\ndemand. Thus Schiller writes, Human beings, as\nappearance, are also an object of the senses. Where the moral\nfeeling finds satisfaction, the aesthetic feeling does not\nwish to be reduced, and the correspondence with an idea may not\nsacrifice any of the appearance. Thus, however rigorously reason\ndemands an ethical expression, the eye demands beauty just as\npersistently\u2026.both these demands are made of the same object,\nalthough they come from different courts of judgment. (\u201cOn Grace\nand Dignity,\u201d NA 277; Curran 144\u20135)\n\n\nBut as far as morality alone is concerned, the\nmastery of will over inclination that is expressed in dignity is all\nthat is required. For Kant, however, morality itself demands\na complete harmony between principle and inclination, because any\ntension between them is a sign that one\u2019s commitment to the principle\nof morality is not yet complete, one\u2019s good will or virtue not yet\nperfected. The self-mastery that is expressed in dignity may often be\nall that human beings can achieve under natural circumstances, and it\ncertainly satisfies the demand for legality in our actions;\nbut as Kant sees it morality requires that perfection of\nvirtue or of the good will that he calls holiness (see Kant\u2019s\nresponse to Schiller in a note added to the second edition of\nKant\u2019s Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason,\n6:23\u20134n.). Thus Kant\u2019s conception of morality actually demands\na greater attunement of principles and feelings than does\nSchiller\u2019s\u2014although Schiller\u2019s might be the more plausible\naccount of morality, that is, one that better accommodates the\nreality of the human condition, precisely for that reason.  Indeed,\nKant may have been carried away by the polemic with Schiller, because\nelsewhere his position is not that human beings must aim at holiness,\nbut only at virtue, not at the elimination of all inclinations\ncontrary to morality but at the strength of will to overcome\nthem.\n8.2 Aesthetic Education and the Achievement of Morality\n\nIn Schiller\u2019s other main philosophical work, the\nletters On the Aesthetic Education of Mankind, he certainly makes a much bolder claim than Kant would ever have countenanced,\nnamely that \u201cit is only through Beauty that man makes his way\nto Freedom\u201d and thus to the achievement of morality and its\nexternal realization in political justice (Aesthetic\nEducation, Second letter, p. 9). Here Schiller implies that the\ncultivation of taste through aesthetic education is a necessary as\nwell as sufficient condition for the achievement of compliance with\nthe ethical and political demands of morality, rather than, as Kant\nheld, merely something that may contribute to moral development. But\nwhen we turn from Schiller\u2019s rhetoric to the details of his argument,\nwe will see that he actually grants aesthetic education a narrower\nr\u00f4le in the realization of morality than Kant does.\n\n\nSchiller presents the problem to be solved by aesthetic education in\nseveral ways, but primarily as a political rather than a moral\nproblem. In his Sixth Letter, he offers an influential diagnosis of\nalienation or fragmentation as the characteristic problem of\nmodernity: \u201cwe see not merely individuals, but whole classes of\npeople, developing but one part of their potentialities, while of the\nrest, as in stunted growths, only vestigial traces remain.\u201d\n(Aesthetic Education, p. 33). Although this is a problem for\nhuman flourishing generally, and might therefore be considered a moral\nrather than specifically political problem, Schiller\u2019s diagnosis of\nthe source of this problem gives a prominent role to a specifically\npolitical cause. Schiller claims that the complex machinery of the\nstate necessitates the separation of ranks and occupations, rather\nthan claiming, as a Marxist diagnosis of alienation would, that a\nseparation of ranks and occupations that has its source in the\nconditions of production necessitates the complex machinery of the\nstate. In another famous passage, Schiller presents the problem as\nthat of effecting the transition from a less just to a more just state\nwithout killing the patient in the operation:\nThe state should not only respect the objective\nand generic character in its individual subjects; it should also honor\ntheir subjective and specific character, and in extending the\ninvisible realm of morals take care not to depopulate the sensible\nrealm of appearance. (Aesthetic Education, Fourth Letter, p.\n19)\n\n\nThe latter passage leads more directly to\nSchiller\u2019s most general characterization of the problem: striking the\nright balance between the universal and the particular, that is, not\nrealizing the ideal at the cost of individuals nor so focusing on\nindividuals as they currently are that all concern for the ideal is\nlost. Schiller characterizes the tension with which he is concerned through\na number of contrasts: person and condition, the atemporal and the\ntemporal, noumenon and phenomena, form and matter, and so on\n(Eleventh Letter). He posits that we are driven in one direction by\nthe \u201cform drive\u201d and in the other by the \u201csensuous\ndrive\u201d (Twelfth Letter). He then claims that we need to\ncultivate a new drive, the \u201cplay drive\u201d (Fourteenth\nLetter), to bring these two drives, and thus person and condition,\nuniversal and particular, and so on, into proper balance with each\nother, \u201cto preserve the life of sense against the encroachments\nof freedom; and second, to secure the personality against the forces\nof sensation\u201d (Thirteenth Letter).  Schiller\u2019s claim is then\nthat it is the experience of beauty which will induce this balance in\nus, and thus what we need is to be educated to experience beauty. In\npractice, since individuals tend to err in one direction or the\nother, that is, to be driven by principles at the cost of ignoring\nparticulars or to be absorbed in particulars and thus inadequately\nattentive to principles, there will be two types of beauty,\n\u201cenergizing\u201d beauty and \u201crelaxing\u201d or\n\u201cmelting\u201d beauty, which will either strengthen an\nindividual\u2019s commitment to principle or relax the grip of principle\non an individual, whichever is needed (Seventeenth Letter).\n\n\nThese claims are grandiose and abstract. In a crucial footnote to the\nThirteenth Letter, however, Schiller comes down to earth, and reveals\nthat what he expects from aesthetic education is something quite\nspecific, although for that reason all the more plausible.  What he\nworried about is \u201cthe pernicious effect, upon both thought and\naction, of an undue surrender to our sensual nature\u201d on the one\nhand and \u201cthe nefarious influence exerted upon our knowledge and\nupon our conduct by a preponderance of rationality\u201d on the\nother. In the realm of scientific inquiry, what we need to learn and\nwhat we can learn from aesthetic experience is not to \u201cthrust\nourselves out upon [nature], with all the impatient anticipations of\nour reason,\u201d without having collected adequate data to support\nour theorizing. In the realm of conduct, thus of the moral generally\nand not just the realm of politics, what we need to learn is to be\nspecifically attentive to the particular circumstances, needs, and\nfeelings of others, and not just to impose our own views upon them.  Schiller\u2019s argument comes down\nto the claim that through the cultivation of our aesthetic sensibility\nwe can learn to be attentive to detail and particularity as well as to\nprinciple and generality, and that being so attentive is a necessary\ncondition for both theoretical and practical success. And it seems\nplausible to suppose that this claim is true, and therefore that\naesthetic education may play a valuable r\u00f4le in the theoretical and\npractical development of human beings, in modern society as much as in\nany other. But this is a far cry from any claim that aesthetic\neducation is sufficient for either theoretical or moral\ndevelopment, or even that it is necessary for such\ndevelopment, as the only way to cultivate the necessary\ncombination of sensitivities. In the case of the natural sciences,\nsurely both their general principles and their particular techniques\nof observation must be taught directly, and presumably a well-managed\nscientific education could also teach the student not to project the\nprinciples unchecked by the data. In the case of morals and politics,\nsurely the general principles must be clearly fixed in the mind of\nthose being initiated into the relevant community, as well as a proper\nempathy for the actual circumstances of others; but while perhaps the\nlatter could be cultivated by aesthetic education, presumably it could\nalso be cultivated directly by suitably edifying moral discourses, and\ncertainly the general principles of morality will still have to be\ndirectly taught or elicited.\n\n\nAs we saw in section 7.2, Kant recognizes these limits on the\nsignificance of the cultivation of taste for moral development, but\nalso described a wider variety of ways in which the former could be\nbeneficial for the latter. The contribution to moral development that\nSchiller hopes to derive from aesthetic education is\nessentially cognitive: through the sensitivity to\nparticularity that we acquire from aesthetic education we learn\nto recognize the circumstances, needs, and feelings of others\nand thereby to apply our principles to them appropriately. Kant,\nhowever, holds that aesthetic experience could give us sensible\nconfirmation of the moral truths we already know through pure reason,\nbut it also give us emotional support in our attempt to act as we know\nwe should, although in no case does he argue that the support that\nmorality can get from aesthetic experience is indispensable. Thus,\nalthough Schiller\u2019s essay \u201cOn Grace and Dignity\u201d appears\nto argue for a greater r\u00f4le for feelings in fulfillment of the demands\nof morality than Kant allows, it is only Kant who insists\nupon moral grounds for striving to realize grace and not just\ndignity. And while Schiller\u2019s letters On Aesthetic Education\ninsist that aesthetic education is a necessary condition for social\njustice, Kant has a broader conception of the contributions\nthat aesthetic experience may make to moral and political development,\nalthough he certainly does not make the cultivation of taste a\nnecessary (let alone sufficient) condition for the realization of\nmorality.\n9. Herder\u2019s Critique of Kant: A Rapprochement between the Two Approaches?\n\n\nIn the five years after the publication of Schiller\u2019s Letters on\nAesthetic Education in 1795, both Romanticism and Absolute\nIdealism emerged, the former in works by Friedrich von Hardenburg\n(\u201cNovalis\u201d) and Friedrich Schlegel, the latter in works by\nJohann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling. But\nsince both of these movements blossomed more fully in the early\ndecades of the nineteenth century, they will not be included in this\nsurvey. Instead, it will conclude with a second look at the work of\nJohann Herder, in this case with his late critique of Kant\u2019s aesthetic\ntheory. Herder, who as we saw had done the bulk of his work in\naesthetics long before the publications of Kant and Schiller, indeed\neven before the publication of Sulzer\u2019s encyclopedia, reacted\nviolently to the new aesthetics of play in his late\nwork Kalligone (1800), i.e., \u201cThe Birth of\nBeauty.\u201d This work, published only three years before Herder\u2019s\ndeath and after his renown had been eclipsed by such new stars as\nSchelling and Fichte, has never received much attention, but beneath\nits bursts of ill-temper it contains interesting and important\ncriticisms of Kant. The theme of Kalligone may be summed up\nwith this statement from its table of contents: \u201cNothing harms\nimmature taste more than if one makes everything into play\u201d\n(Kalligone, p. 660). Herder\u2019s critique came too late in his\nKant\u2019s life for him to respond to it.  If he had been able to respond,\nhe would have had no good reply to some of Herder\u2019s criticisms; but if\nHerder had had more sympathy for Kant\u2019s expository method in the\nthird Critique, he might have realized that on some of the\ncentral substantive points of his criticism the distance between\nhimself and Kant is not as great as it initially seems. In particular,\nHerder\u2019s representation of Kant\u2019s aesthetics as a pure theory of\nmental play mistakes Kant\u2019s initial analysis of the simplest form of\nnatural beauty for his whole theory of natural and artistic beauty. If\nHerder had recognized the importance for Kant of the more complicated\ncases of adherent and artistic beauty, he would have seen that there\nis considerable common ground between Kant\u2019s aesthetics of free play\nand his own aesthetics of the sensory apprehension of truth.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s criticisms of Lessing and Riedel (section 5.1) prefigure\nseveral of his objections to Kant. He objects to Kant\u2019s abstract\nmethod in aesthetics, to his failure to emphasize adequately the r\u00f4le\nof the senses and the differences among them both in his account of\naesthetic experience and in his classification of the arts, to an\ninadequate recognition of the importance of truth (indeed truth in\nseveral senses ) in our experience of art, and to what he sees as\nKant\u2019s inadequate emphasis on the way in which aesthetic experience\ngives us a feeling of being alive. But what is missing from Herder\u2019s\nearly critical aesthetics is an objection to the aesthetics of play,\nfor the simple reason that Kant had not yet made that prominent in\nGerman aesthetics. In turning now to Herder\u2019s criticisms of Kant\nin Kalligone, we will have to add that objection to his list\nof charges.\n\nKalligone is a polemic against Kant\u2019s Critique of the\nPower of Judgment, more precisely against its first half, the\n\u201cCritique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment,\u201d loosely\nstructured in parallel with Kant\u2019s work, although with numerous\ndigressions, sometimes even in dialogue form, and statements of\nHerder\u2019s own positions. Like Herder\u2019s polemic with Lessing in\nthe Groves of Criticism, his response to Kant\u2019s work is\nlonger than its target, and not all of its themes can be discussed\nhere. In ways anticipated in Herder\u2019s earlier work, Kalligone\nattacks Kant\u2019s methodology and his neglect of the concrete r\u00f4le of the\nsenses in a discipline that is, as defined by Baumgarten, supposed to\nfocus precisely on them. In an expression of the naturalism that\npervades his work, Herder also attacks Kant\u2019s appeals to the\n\u201csupersensible\u201d in his interpretation of aesthetic\nexperiences, especially the experience of sublimity. But Herder\u2019s most\nvehement objections are to Kant\u2019s insistence upon the\ndisinterestedness of aesthetic judgment and to his exclusion of a r\u00f4le\nfor determinate concepts in the free play of the mental powers in\naesthetic experience, which Herder sees as excluding any r\u00f4le for the\nknowledge of truth in aesthetic experience. We will focus here on\nHerder\u2019s criticisms of the disinterestedness and non-conceptuality of\naesthetic judgment.\n\n\nHerder\u2019s general theory of aesthetic experience is that it is an\nexperience of well-being arising from a perception of the\ntrue order of nature, which he opposes to Kant\u2019s theory of\nthe disinterestedness of aesthetic experience and\nattachment. Before we turn to that central issue, however, we may note\nHerder\u2019s objection that Kant\u2019s aesthetics does not pay sufficient\nattention to the concrete r\u00f4le of the senses in aesthetic\nexperience. The charge of insensitivity to the specificity of the\nsenses, as we saw, was at the heart of Herder\u2019s early aesthetics,\nbeginning with his critique of Lessing, and it manifests itself in\nvarious ways in his critique of Kant. One point at which it is\nparticularly clear is in his objection to Kant\u2019s scheme for the\nclassification of the fine arts, a scheme based on the differing\ncapacities of different media for meaning, tone, and gesture that\nHerder claims \u201cthrows us back into the old chaos.\u201d Kant\u2019s\nbasic division is between the verbal (redende) and the\nformative or visual (bildende) arts, and Herder says that\nKant\u2019s account of the\nso-called verbal arts [is] built upon\na word-play, which makes them\u2026into play, and not in\nthe technical sense of this word; and about the formative\narts as well as about the arts that effect sentiments nothing is said\nthat serves for the essence of each and the essence of\nall. (Kalligone, p. 939)\n\n\nBy contrast, Herder argues that any division of the arts, as well\nas any account of the way in which different arts need to be\ncultivated and contribute to our overall cultivation and development,\nmust attend to the specificity of our senses. For Herder, any\nclassification of the arts, and indeed any theory of aesthetic\neducation and the contribution of aesthetic education to general\neducation, must be based upon a firm grasp of the differences as well\nas the similarities among sight, hearing, touch, speech, and song (for\nthat too is among the arts of the tongue).  In his view Kant does not\nhave that grasp. Nor does it seem too much of a stretch to think that\nSchiller\u2019s theory of aesthetic education is deficient in this regard,\ntoo. Although Herder does not mention Schiller by name anywhere\nin Kalligone, he does begin the work by bemoaning the\ninfluence of Kant\u2019s third Critique upon his followers, and\nSchiller might be supposed to be the foremost among these, albeit one\nwith whom Herder had to maintain cordial relations in Weimar and\nperhaps spared for this reason.\n\n\nWe may now turn to the two main topics of Herder\u2019s criticism, namely\nKant\u2019s theory of the disinterestedness of aesthetic judgment and of\nhis doctrine of the purposeless play of imagination and understanding\nas the basis of such judgment. Herder had already expressed doubt\nabout disinterestedness as a fundamental aesthetic category in his\npolemic with Riedel in the fourth Grove, where he had\nrejected Riedel\u2019s definition of the beautiful as \u201cthat which can\nplease without an interested aim [interessierte Absicht] and\nwhich also can please if we do not possess it\u201d (\u201cFourth\nGrove,\u201d p. 291). At that time, however, Herder\u2019s objection\nseemed to be only that the concept of disinterestedness is not\n\u201coriginal,\u201d that is, that disinterestedness by itself\ncannot explain our pleasure in the beautiful and thus could\nat best be a consequence of some more fundamental explanation of\nbeauty. In Kalligone, however, he argues much more broadly\nthat our pleasure in beauty is not disinterested, but rather\nthat it is intimately connected with our most fundamental interest,\nour interest in life itself. He does this by rejecting Kant\u2019s rigid\ndistinction between the agreeable, the beautiful, and the good,\narguing that all of these notions are intimately connected and that\nthey all reflect our fundamental interest in enjoying a harmonious,\nwell-adapted life.\n\n\nThe first step in Herder\u2019s argument is to reject Kant\u2019s identification\nof agreeableness with sensory gratification narrowly understood. For\nHerder, the agreeable (angenehm) is what actually liberates\nand strengthens me and gives me a feeling of liberation and strength,\nof not merely being alive but of living freely and strongly. This\nfeeling can come through the engagement of any or all of my senses:\nwhatever preserves, promotes, expands, in short\nis harmonious with the feeling of my existence, each\nof my senses gladly accepts that, appropriates that to itself, and\nfinds it agreeable.\n\n\nWhat gives us such feelings is moreover\nuniversally pleasing, because \u201cwell-being, welfare,\nhealth\u201d (Wohlsein, Heil, Gesundheit) are the\n\u201cground and end of the existence of every living thing\u2026We\nall desire well-being, and whatever promotes this well-being in any\nway is agreeable\u201d (Kalligone, p. 668).\n\n\nWith the agreeable so broadly conceived, it is then easy for Herder to\nsuggest that the beautiful cannot be rigidly separated from it, but\nmust rather be more like a species of it, namely that which gives us\nsuch agreeable feelings of well-being through the \u201cnoble\nsenses,\u201d through figures, colors, tones, and the re-creation of\nall of these through the artificial signs of literary language.  To be\nsure, there are specific contexts in which we might call something\nthat is disagreeable good, or something that is beautiful\ndisagreeable, but these are the exceptions, not the rule\u2014a\nmedicine that is good for one, for example, may nevertheless be\ndisagreeable (Kalligone, pp. 672\u20133n.). But although the\nagreeable, the beautiful, and the good, which Kant construed as three\nfundamentally \u201cdifferent relations of representations to the\nfeeling of pleasure and displeasure\u201d (CPJ, \u00a75,\n5:209), do have to be distinguished in certain contexts, they\nnevertheless are all expressions of our pleasure in a free and healthy\nlife. Given this assumption, it is then not hard for Herder to argue\nthat so far from being disinterested, our pleasure in beauty is\nnecessarily of the greatest interest to us. But while he argues that\nthe beautiful necessarily interests us, Herder also insists that the\nbeautiful does not appeal to self-interest\nor self-love: the pleasure and interest in the genuinely\nbeautiful as well as the agreeable and good is universal, not personal\nor idiosyncratic.\n\n\nIt could well be argued that this is all that Shaftesbury originally\nmeant when he introduced the concept of disinterestedness into modern\nmoral and aesthetic discourse. For him, the opposite of disinterested\nis mercenary, that which one wants or does just for a\npersonal reward (Shaftesbury, Sensus Communis, Part II,\nSection III, in Characteristicks, vol. I, p. 55).  And this\nis arguably all that Riedel meant when he said that the beautiful is\nthat which can please us \u201cwithout possession.\u201d It would\nnot be reasonable, however, to claim that all that Kant meant by\nsaying that the pleasure in beauty is disinterested is that it must be\nable to please anyone apart from personal possession and use or\nconsumption of the beautiful object. He certainly seems to insist that\nthe source of our pleasure in the beautiful has nothing to do with the\nsources of our pleasure in the agreeable and the good. Kant is\napparently open to Herder\u2019s criticism, if indeed Herder\u2019s claim is\nthat our pleasures in the agreeable, the beautiful, and the good all\nultimately rest on our pleasure in the feeling of free and healthy\nlife. However, before we consider whether the distance here between\nKant and Herder is as great as Herder thinks, let us consider one last\ncharge on Herder\u2019s indictment of Kant, namely his objection to Kant\u2019s\ntheory that the experience of beauty is an experience of a free and\nconceptless play of the mental powers of imagination and\nunderstanding.\n\n\nAs noted earlier, Herder\u2019s antipathy to Kant\u2019s central notion of the\nfree play of our cognitive powers is evident from the outset\nof Kalligone. In his Preface, Herder writes bitterly that\n\u201cthe self-named only possible philosophy\u201d has\ntransformed the arts \u201cinto a short or long, boring\napelike play\u201d (Kalligone, p.  648). In the body of\nthe text, Herder argues both generally that all response to objects,\nfeeling and sentiment as well as judgment, is accompanied with a\nconcept of the object. He also argues that, more specifically, our\npleasure in beautiful objects is always a pleasure in a sensed or felt\nrecognition of their adaptation to their environment, whether natural\nor artificial, that is impossible without the application of a concept\nto the object. Herder launches his general attack immediately\nfollowing his critique of Kant\u2019s first moment. Kant\u2019s second moment,\nHerder says, asserts that the \u201cbeautiful is what\npleases without a concept,\u201d and the third speaks of a\n\u201cForm of purposiveness without representation of an\nend.\u201d In Herder\u2019s view, however, \u201c [t]hat something could\nplease without a concept, and indeed please universally, is contrary\nto nature and experience\u201d (Kalligone,\np. 675). Depending on how we take this claim, of course, Herder may\nnot be saying anything with which Kant would disagree: Kant more than\nanyone else argues that all experience of an object requires\nconsciousness of a concept as well as of empirical intuitions of that\nobject, the matter of which is sensation. But he also holds that we\ncould have a feeling of pleasure in an object\nwithout considering what concepts apply to it, and on the\nbasis of such a feeling make the judgment that it is beautiful. Herder\nis specifically rejecting that claim. On what basis does he do so?\n\n\nHe does so by means of the more particular argument that our pleasure\nin beauty is in fact a pleasure in our sensed or felt recognition of\nan object\u2019s adaptation to its environment, together with the premise\nthat such a pleasure cannot be felt without a recognition of the\napplication of a relevant concept to the object. Herder argues for\nthis premise by going through a series of cases, precisely the kinds\nof particular examples that he accuses Kant of neglecting. First he\nconsiders figures (Gestalten), then colors and tones, and\nthen a series of kinds of natural things, from stones and crystals to\na series of living things ranging from flowers to human beings. In all\nof these cases, he argues, we respond to a recognition of the\ncharacter of a thing and its relation to its environment that is\nnecessarily mediated by our application of a concept to it. Before we\nconsider whether this is a fair objection to Kant, more generally\nwhether there is as much distance between Kant\u2019s views and Herder\u2019s as\nHerder himself believes, let us ask why Herder thinks such perception\nof an object\u2019s essence and its well-being in its environment is so\npleasing to us and so important for our own sense of well-being.\n\n\nThe answer to this question is what we might call a harmonic or\nsympathetic theory of the connection between pleasure in well-being\nand truth: Herder thinks that the perception of true harmony and\nwell-being in the things around us generates a parallel harmony and\nfeeling of it in ourselves:\nMay we not rejoice that we live in a world of\ngood order and good form [Wohlordnung und Wohlgestalt],\nwhere all results of the laws of nature in gentle forms reveal to us\nas it were a band of rest and motion, an elastic-effective constancy\nof things, in short beauty as the bodily expression of a corporeal\nperfection that is harmonious both within itself and to our\nfeeling? (Kalligone, p.  687)\n\n\nThe key idea here is not that we take pleasure in the direct\nconsumption of the fruits of a harmonious nature, but rather that\nthere is a kind of resonance between harmony and well-being in nature\nand our own sense of well-being: the perception of harmony in nature\nmakes our own being feel well-ordered, just as the perception of\ndisharmony in nature inevitably although painfully attracts our\nattention. This is the underlying vision of Herder\u2019s mature\naesthetics: our feeling of beauty does not arise from a free play with\nforms that might be triggered by something in the objective world but\nis not constrained by it. Rather, the feeling of beauty is a\nsubjective response to the perception of objective harmony, a\nsubjective feeling of well-being triggered by empathy with the\nwell-being of other things in the world.\n\n\nHowever, on several central points the differences between Kant and\nHerder are not quite as great as the latter supposed. First, Kant\nhimself interpreted the feeling of the free play of the cognitive\npowers in aesthetic experience as a feeling of life, and thus at the\ndeepest level his conception of the source of aesthetic pleasure is\nnot that different from Herder\u2019s. Second, although Kant began his\nanalysis with the simplest case of the free judgment of natural\nbeauty, which is supposedly not dependent upon our conceptualization\nof its object, it does not end there. As he complicated his analysis\nof aesthetic experiences to include the cases of the adherent beauty\nof works of nature as well as of human art in the general sense and of\nfine art in particular, Kant clearly recognized the r\u00f4le of\nconceptualization in our response to the work, and in the case of art\nin the production as the well the reception of the work, and\ntransformed his conception of free play with the mere form of an\nobject into a conception of felt harmony between the form and the\nconcept of the object which is not so different from Herder\u2019s\nconception of the harmony in a beautiful object.  Finally, when Kant\ncomplicated his initial conception of the disinterestedness of\naesthetic judgment to take account of our intellectual interest in the\nexistence of natural beauty, he recognized that our experience of\nbeauty is an experience of well-being and being at home in the world\nthat is not unrelated to Herder\u2019s conception of our experience of\nbeauty. Nevertheless, as Kant\u2019s terminology suggests, his conception\nof this interest may have remained more intellectual and moralistic\nthan Herder himself would prefer.\n\n\nIndeed, in his lectures on anthropology\u2014which he began offering\nonly in 1772\u201373, thus a decade after Herder had studied with\nhim\u2014Kant had made the connection between the free play of the\nfaculties and the feeling of life clear and central to his aesthetic\ntheory.  There Kant argued that \u201cGratification or pleasure is\nthe feeling of the promotion of life,\u201d indeed that life itself\n\u201cis the consciousness of a free and regular play of all the\npowers and faculties of human beings.\u201d He equated the free play\nof our powers and faculties with their unhindered activity, and thus\nfound the ultimate source of all pleasure in the unhindered activity\nof our powers:\nThe play of the powers of the mind\n[Gem\u00fcths Kr\u00e4fte] must be strongly alive and free if\nit is to animate. Intellectual pleasure consists in the consciousness\nof the use of freedom in accordance with rules. Freedom is the\ngreatest life of the human being, through which he exercises his\nactivity without hindrance. (Vorlesungen \u00fcber\nAnthropologie, 27:559\u201360)\n\n\nIn fact, Kant completes this discussion, which\nopens his lectures on the second part of psychology, on the faculties\nof approval and disapproval, with the remark that \u201cAll\ngratifications are related to life. Life, however, is a unity, and in\nso far as all gratifications aim at this, they are all homogeneous,\nlet the sources from which they spring be what they are\u201d (ibid.,\np. 561). Herder could have included these sentences in the footnote\nfrom Kalligone (pp. 672\u20133) in which he objects to\nKant\u2019s supposedly complete separation of the beautiful from the\nagreeable and the good.\n\n\nFinally, perhaps the deepest of Herder\u2019s criticisms of Kant is his\nattack upon the disinterestedness of aesthetic judgment, his\ninsistence that there is a continuum rather than discontinuity between\nour responses to the agreeable, the beautiful, and the good. But on\nthe matter of disinterestedness, too, Kant begins with a simple\nstatement of a position that then turned out to be more complicated\nthan it initially appeared. There can be no question that Kant wants\nto distinguish genuinely aesthetic experience from merely\nphysiological gratification of the senses, from the approval of\nutility, or from moral approval, and that he does this by saying that\naesthetic judgment neither presupposes nor gives rise to any interest\nin the existence of its object. But numerous factors complicate this\npicture.\n\n\nFirst, Kant always defines pleasure as a state of mind connected with\na disposition toward its own continuation, and in the first draft of\nthe Introduction to the third Critique he adds that pleasure\nis a ground \u201cfor producing its object\u201d (First Introduction\nto CPJ, section VIII, 20:230\u20131). There are technical\nreasons why Kant does not want to speak here of an interest\nin the continuation of pleasure and/or the production of its object,\nbut it is certainly reasonable to say that on Kant\u2019s own account any\npleasure, including even the purest pleasure in beauty, is accompanied\nwith some form of attachment to the possibility of its own\ncontinued and future experience, and therefore ordinarily to the\navailability of the objects that trigger that pleasure.\n\n\nFurther, Kant explicitly argues that the properly aesthetic pleasure\nin beautiful objects enters into combination with interests, also\nproperly so called, in the existence of those objects. Under the\nrubric of the \u201cempirical interest\u201d in the beautiful, he\nargued that there are societal reasons for taking interest in the\navailability and possession of beautiful objects. Although he denies\nthat there is any a priori relation of these reasons to the\nexperience of beauty (CPJ, \u00a741, 5:297), this is not to\ndeny the existence of such attachments.  Under the rubric of the\n\u201cintellectual interest in the beautiful,\u201d Kant then\ndescribes a reason for attachment to the beautiful that is apparently\nsupposed to be a priori, namely, that the existence of beauty\nis a \u201ctrace\u201d or \u201csign\u201d that nature is amenable\nto the satisfaction of our moral interests (CPJ,\n\u00a742, 5:300).\n\n\nKant\u2019s conception of an intellectual interest in the beautiful does\nnot seem entirely remote from Herder\u2019s view that our sense of\nwell-being in an object is accompanied with a corresponding sense of\nour own well-being, although there are two key differences. For one,\nHerder insists upon a recognition of an objective well-being\nto which our subjective feeling of well-being is a response, while for\nKant well-being is always subjective, that is, our own, and\nthe satisfaction of our aesthetic aims and of our moral aims may be\nparallel, but are both subjective. Our aesthetic pleasure in natural\nbeauty is a sign of the possibility of our moral well-being in nature,\nnot a response to a harmony in nature that has nothing to do with\nus. Second, Kant clearly wants to keep the connection between the\nsatisfaction of our aesthetic aims and the satisfaction of our moral\ninterests separate although connected, thus not collapsing aesthetic\npleasure into moral satisfaction. Further, Kant seems to suggest that\na sound moral interest in nature\u2019s amenability to our objectives is\na condition of the intellectual but aesthetic interest in the\nexistence of (natural) beauty. From Herder\u2019s point of view, that might\nseem to be an excessive moralization of an interest in the beautiful\nthat should be entirely natural, although from Kant\u2019s point of view\nHerder\u2019s insistence on the continuity of the beautiful and the good\nmight actually run the risk of an excessive moralization of aesthetic\nexperience. So no doubt there are differences between them, but it is\nmisleading of Herder to suggest that Kant simply fails to recognize\nthat we have a real attachment to the interest in the beautiful. Kant\ndid recognize that, but wanted to keep that attachment somewhat\ncomplicated and indirect in order to avoid the risk of an excessive\nmoralization of the aesthetic but at the same time\nalso avoid the risk of an excessive aestheticization of the moral.\n\n\nIn conclusion, Kant occupied a central place in\neighteenth-century German aesthetics, although he is hardly the only\nimportant figure in the period. Rather, he synthesized the aesthetics\nof truth, especially moral truth, represented by the Wolffians with\nthe aesthetics of play represented in Germany by Mendelssohn and\nSulzer, but did so in a subtle and complicated way that resisted the\nsimplifications that Schiller and Herder, for all their other\ninsights, attempted to press upon him.  At the same time, Kant\nrefused to allow the importance of the arousal of emotions for its own\nsake in tasteful aesthetic experience, and thus rejected this\naspect of aesthetic experience that had been recognized by Baumgarten\nand Meier and analyzed in considerable detail by Mendelssohn.  So\nKant\u2019s synthesis of approaches to aesthetic experience was by no means\ncomplete.  It might then be expected that the history of aesthetics in\nthe period immediately following Kant would have turned to the task of\nintegrating emotional impact into a complex theory of aesthetic\nexperience.  That is not what happened, however, as both Hegel and\nSchopenhauer developed different versions of purely cognitivist\naesthetics, rejecting Kant\u2019s theory of play, and downplayed the\nemotional impact of aesthetic experience even more than Kant had done.\nIt would take the rest of the nineteenth century to integrate the\nthree approaches to aesthetics that had been developed in the\neighteenth century.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["<a id=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>", "<a id=\"GenStuSpeHis\">General Studies and Specialized Histories</a>", "<a id=\"SecLitIndAut\">Secondary Literature: Individual Authors</a>"], "cat_ref_text": {"<a id=\"PriSou\">Primary Sources</a>": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Cooper, Anthony Ashley (Third Earl of\nShaftesbury), <em>Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions,\nTimes</em>, edited by Philip Ayres (Oxford: Clarendon Press,\n1999).", "Baumgarten, Alexander Gottlieb, <em>Aesthetica/\u00c4sthetik</em>,\nedited by Dagmar Mirbach, 2 vols.
