    "main_text": "Aesthetics || Henry\u2019s Phenomenological Reading of Kandinsky\n3.2 Henry\u2019s Phenomenological Reading of Kandinsky\n\nAccording to Henry, Kandinsky is the first artist to theorize a new\nconception of art and to root art in transcendental life. But\nhow could art, and painting in particular, \u201cintensify\u201d\ninvisible and affective life since it is made of visible elements such\nas form and color? For Kandinsky, color is first and foremost a\n\u201cradically subjective impression\u201d, \u201can inner\nresonance\u201d (AP 290). In the terminology of Henry\u2019s\nphenomenology, such an apparent paradox is accounted for by the\nduplicity of appearing: on the one hand, there is a noematic color,\nthe color red as a moment of a particular object, which is only made\npossible by a primal impression of red that is, on the other hand,\npurely immanent and subjective. Or, as Henry writes: \n\n\nThere is no red in the world. Red is a sensation, and such sensation\nis absolutely subjective, originally invisible. Original colors are\ninvisible; they are, however, laid over things through a process of\nprojection. (AP 290) \n\n\nFor the painter, then, the choice of a color is determined by its\nemotional power. It is not the world that is painted, but, in a sense,\nemotion itself. This applies to abstract painting, which obviously\ndoes not represent any worldly object, but it also applies to any\nother form of painting. A painting that would be a simple copy of what\nhas been seen in the world would be utterly\n\u201cinsignificant\u201d. As Henry\u2019s example of a painting\nfrom the Quattrocento illustrates, even figurative\npainting\u2014in this case a representation of the Adoration of the\nMagi\u2014chooses its colors according to their emotional power, not\naccording to a \u201crealistic\u201d representation. Thus, while\nproviding a theoretical basis for abstract painting, it is in fact a\ntheory of painting as such that Kandinsky provides. For such a theory,\nforms are, very much like colors, not entities exterior to life but\nthe expression of a force (K 123). Kandinsky\u2019s theory of\nforms\u2014referring to point, plane and line as their basic\nelements\u2014therefore amounts to a theory of forces that inhabit\nnot the world but our body as it is subjectively lived through (K 82).\nSuch is the essence of Kandinsky\u2019s theory of painting: to be a\nvisible composition that both expresses and touches living\ninteriority. Through this project, and as Kandinsky himself admits,\npainting has been ascribed the same purpose as music: to express\n\u201cnot the world [\u2026] but the Ground of Being and of\nLife\u201d (\u201cDessiner la musique\u201d, PHV III, 272).\n",
