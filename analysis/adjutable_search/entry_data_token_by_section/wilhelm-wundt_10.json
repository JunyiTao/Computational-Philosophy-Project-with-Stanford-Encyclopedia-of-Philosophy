    "main_text": "The order of knowledge || Psychology and logic\n8. Conclusion\n\nWundt\u2019s conception of psychology was always controversial. At\nleast in Germany, the struggle over the status and philosophical\nmeaning of \u201cconsciousness\u201d resulted, on the one hand, in\nthe exclusion of Wundtian empiricism from philosophy departments,\nstriving to maintain their speculative purity, and, on the other, the\ninstitutional establishment of experimental psychology as an\nindependent discipline. This was not the outcome Wundt had desired. He\nhad wished to reform philosophy, not as a synthetic science,\nbut with a direct, indispensable, juridical relation\nvis-\u00e0-vis both the natural and human sciences. He\nnever saw his psychological scientism as a threat to\nphilosophy\u2014on the contrary, he considered his psychology to be a\npart of philosophy (cf. Boring 1950: 325), one necessary for\nphilosophy to take its proper place in the totality of the sciences.\nIndeed, philosophy could only assume that position through the\nmediating position of psychology (PP I: 3). Yet academic\nphilosophers, denied the possibility of any legislative or executive\nfunctions in the sciences, rejected the juridical ones as well,\nbitterly resisting contamination of their pure pursuit by the\nempiricism of the new psychology. In Germany, resistance was\nespecially stiff among neo-Kantians, and later the Phenomenologists.\nIn the end, the quarreling parties ineluctably assumed positions\nsimilar to their opponents\u2019\u2014though of course in a\n\u201cpurified\u201d\n way.[52]\n\nLet us return to James\u2019s mean\n remark[53]\n about Wundt: he has no noeud vital, no central idea, and so\nthis would-be Napoleon-planarian can never be \u201ckilled all at\nonce\u201d. Setting aside Wundt\u2019s need to be killed at once or\nin bits, a fair and attentive reader will respectfully reject such\nscintillating criticisms. For although Wundt has many\nideas\u2014\u201cthe theory of actuality\u201d, the\n\u201cprinciple of psychophysical parallelism\u201d,\n\u201cvoluntarism\u201d, \u201ccreative resultants\u201d, etc.,\netc.\u2014yet they all do have a single unifying node, namely what I\nhave here called \u201cmonistic perspectivism\u201d. If Wundt has a\nbig idea, it is that Being is a single flow of Becoming with many\nsides and many ways of being described. Consequently we, as\npart of this Being, have many ways of describing and explaining it.\nFew have as unblinkingly accepted the consequences of their starting\npoints, or more doggedly pursued them to their various ends as\nWundt.\n",
