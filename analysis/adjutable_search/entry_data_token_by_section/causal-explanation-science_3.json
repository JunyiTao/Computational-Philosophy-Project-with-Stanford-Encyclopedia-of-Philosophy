    "main_text": "Non-causal and Mathematical Explanation\n5. Non-causal and Mathematical Explanation\n\nWe noted above that there has been considerable recent interest in the\nquestion of whether there are non-causal explanations (of the\n\u201cwhy\u201d variety) or whether instead all explanations are\ncausal. Although this entry does not discuss non-causal explanations\nin detail, this issue raises the question of whether there is anything\ngeneral that might be said about what makes an explanation\n\u201ccausal\u201d as opposed to \u201cnon-causal\u201d. In what\nfollows we review some proposals about the causal/non-causal contrast,\nincluding ideas that abstract somewhat from the details of the\ntheories described in previous sections.\n\nWe will follow the philosophical literature on this topic by focusing\non candidate explanations that target empirical explananda within\nempirical science but (it is claimed) explain these non-causally.\nThese contrast with explanations within mathematics, as when some\nmathematical proofs are regarded as explanatory (of mathematical\nfacts). Accounts of non-causal explanation in empirical science\ntypically focus on explanatory factors that seem\n\u201cmathematical\u201d, that abstract from lower-level causal\ndetails, and/or that are related to the explanatory target via\ndependency relations that are (in some sense) non-empirical, even\nthough the explanatory target appears to be an empirical claim. A\ncommon suggestion is that explanations exhibiting one or more of these\nfeatures, qualify as non-causal. Purported examples include appeals to\nmathematical facts to explain various traits in biological systems,\nsuch as the prime-number life cycles of cicadas, the hexagonal-shape\nof the bee\u2019s honeycomb, and the fact that seeds on a sunflower\nhead are described by the golden angle (Baker 2005; Lyon & Colyvan\n2008; Lyon 2012). An additional illustration is Lange\u2019s claim\n(e.g., 2013: 488) that one can explain why 23 strawberries cannot be\nevenly divided among three children by appealing to the mathematical\nfact that 23 is not evenly divisible by three. It is claimed that in\nthese cases, explaining the outcome of interest requires appealing to\nmathematical relationships, which are distinct from causal\nrelationships, in the sense that the former are non-contingent and\npart of some mathematical theory (e.g., arithmetic, geometry, graph\ntheory, calculus) or a consequence of some mathematical axiom\nsystem.\n\nA closely related idea is that in addition to appealing to\nmathematical relationships, non-causal explanations abstract from\nlower-level detail, with the implication that although these details\nmay be causal, they are unnecessary for the explanation which is\nconsequently taken to be non-causal. The question of whether it is\npossible to traverse each bridge in the city of K\u00f6nigsberg\nexactly once (hereafter just \u201ctraverse\u201d) is a\nmuch-discussed example. Euler provided a mathematical proof that\nwhether such traversability is possible depends on higher-level\ntopological or graph-theoretical properties concerning the\nconnectivity of the bridges, as opposed to any lower-level causal\ndetails of the system (Euler 1736 [1956]; Pincock 2012). This\nexplanatory pattern is similar to other topological or network\nexplanations in the literature, which explain despite abstracting from\nlower-level causal detail (Huneman 2012; Kostic 2020; Ross 2021b).\nOther candidates for non-causal explanations are minimal model\nexplanations, in which the removal of at least some or perhaps all\ncausal detail is used to explain why systems which differ\nmicrophysically all exhibit the same behavior in some respects\n(Batterman 2002; Chirimuuta 2014; Ross 2015; and the entry on\n models in science).\n\nStill other accounts (not necessarily inconsistent with those\ndescribed above) attempt to characterize some non-causal explanations\nin terms of the absence of other features (besides those described\nabove). Woodward (2018) discusses two types of cases.\n\n(5.1)\nCases in which the factors cited in the explanans are not possible\ntargets of physical interventions, although we can still ask what\nwould be the case if those factors were different.\n(5.2)\nCases in which, although the factors in the explanans are possible\ntargets of interventions, the dependency relation between explanans\nand explanandum is \u201cmathematical\u201d rather than\ncontingent.\n\n\nAn example of\n (5.1)\n is a purported explanation relating the possibility of stable\nplanetary orbits to the dimensionality of space \u2013 given natural\nassumptions, stable orbits are possible in a three-dimensional space\nbut not possible in a space of dimensionality greater than three, so\nthat the possibility of stable orbits in this sense seems to depend on\nthe dimensionality of space. (For discussion see Ehrenfest 1917;\nB\u00fcchel 1963 [1969]; Callendar 2005). Assuming it is not possible\nto intervene to change the dimensionality of space, this explanation\n(if that is what it is) is treated as non-causal within an\ninterventionist framework because of this impossibility. In other\nwords, the distinction between explanations that appeal to factors\nthat are targets of possible interventions and those that appeal to\nfactors that are not targets of possible interventions is taken to\nmark one dividing line between causal and non-causal explanations.\n\nIn the second set of cases\n (5.2),\n there are factors cited in the explanans that can be changed\nunder interventions but the relationship between this property and the\nexplanandum is non-contingent and \u201cmathematical\u201d. For\nexample, it is certainly possible to intervene to change the\nconfiguration of bridges in K\u00f6nigsberg and in this way to change\ntheir traversability but the relation between the bridge configuration\nand their traversability is, as we have seen, non-contingent. Many of\nthe examples mentioned earlier \u2013 the cicada, honeybee, and\nsunflower cases \u2013 are similar. In these cases, the\nnon-contingent character of the dependency relation between explanans\nand explanandum is claimed to mark off these explanations as\nnon-causal.\n\nA feature of many of the candidates for non-causal explanation\ndiscussed above (and arguably another consideration that distinguishes\ncausal from non-causal explanations) is that the non-causal\nexplanations often seem to explain why some outcome is\npossible or impossible (e.g., why stable orbits are\npossible or impossible in spaces of different dimensions, why it is\npossible or not to traverse various configurations of bridges). By\ncontrast it seems characteristic of causal explanations that they are\nconcerned with a range of outcomes all of which are taken to be\npossible and instead explain why one such outcome in contrast to an\nalternative is realized (why an electric field has a certain strength\nrather than some alternative strength.)\n\nWhile many have taken the above examples to represent clear cases of\nnon-causal, mathematical explanation, others have argued that these\nexplanations remain causal through-and-through. One example of this\nexpansive position about causal explanation is Strevens (2018).\nAccording to Strevens, the K\u00f6nigsberg and other examples are\ncases in which mathematics plays a merely representational role, for\nexample the role of representing difference-makers that dictate the\nmovement of causal processes in the world. Strevens refers to these as\n\u201cnon-tracking\u201d explanations, which identify limitations on\ncausal processes that can explain their final outcome, but not the\nexact path taken to them (Strevens 2018: 112). For Strevens the\ntopological structure represented in the K\u00f6nigsberg\u2019s case\ncaptures information about causal structure or the web of causal\ninfluence \u2013 in this way the information relevant to the\nexplanation, although abstract, is claimed to be causal. While this\nargument is suggestive, one open question is how the kairetic account\ncan capture the fact that some of these cases involve explanations of\nimpossibilities, where the source of the impossibility is not\nobviously \u201cstructural\u201d (Lange 2013, 2016). For example,\nthe impossibility of evenly dividing 23 by 3 does not appear to be a\nconsequence of the way in which a structure influences some causal\n process.[16]\n\nIn addition to the examples and considerations just described, the\nphilosophical literature contains many other proposed contrasts\nbetween causal and non-causal explanations, with accompanying claims\nabout how to classify particular cases. For example, Sober (1983)\nclaims that \u201cequilibrium explanations\u201d are non-causal.\nThese are explanations in which an outcome is explained by showing\nthat, because it is an equilibrium (or better, a unique equilibrium) ,\nany one of a large number of different more specific processes would\nhave led to that outcome. As an illustration, for sexually reproducing\npopulations meeting certain additional conditions (see below), natural\nselection will produce an equilibrium in which there are equal numbers\nof males and females, although the detailed paths by which this\noutcome is produced (which conception events lead to males or females)\nwill vary on different occasions. The underlying intuition here is\nthat causal explanations are those that track specific trajectories or\nconcrete processes, while equilibrium explanations do not do this. By\ncontrast the kairetic theory treats at least some equilibrium\nexplanations as causal in an extended sense (Strevens 2008: 267).\nInterventionist accounts at least in form described in Woodward (2003)\nalso take equilibrium explanations to be causal to the extent that\ninformation is provided about what the equilibrium itself depends on.\n(That is, the interventionist framework takes the explanandum to be\nwhy this equilibrium rather than some alternative equilibrium\nobtains.) For example, the sex ratio equilibrium depends on such\nfactors as the amount of parental investment required to produce each\nsex. Differences in required investment can lead to equilibria in\nwhich there are unequal numbers of males and females. On\ninterventionist accounts, parental investment is thus among the causes\nof the sex ratio because it makes a difference for which equilibrium\nis realized. Interventionist accounts are able to reach this\nconclusion because they treat relatively \u201cabstract\u201d\nfactors like parental investment as causes as long as interventions on\nthese are systematically associated with associated with changes in\noutcomes. Thus, in contrast to some of the accounts described above,\ninterventionism does not regard the abstractness per se of an\nexplanatory factor as a bar to interpreting it as causal.\n\nThere has also been considerable discussion of whether computational\nexplanations of the sort found in cognitive psychology and cognitive\nneuroscience that relate inputs to outputs via computations are causal\nor mechanistic. Many advocates (Piccinini 2006; Piccinini & Craver\n2011) of mechanistic models of explanation have regarded such\nexplanations as at best mechanism sketches, since they say little or\nnothing about realizing (e.g., neurobiological) detail. Since these\nwriters tend to treat \u201cmechanistic explanation\u201d,\n\u201ccausal explanation\u201d and even \u201cexplanation\u201d as\nco-extensional, at least in the biomedical sciences, they seem to\nleave no room for a notion of non-causal explanation. By contrast\ncomputational explanations count as causal by interventionist lights\nas long as they correctly describe how outputs vary under\ninterventions on inputs (Rescorla 2014). But other analyses of\ncomputational models suggest that they are similar to non-causal forms\nof explanation (Chirimuuta 2014, 2018).\n",
