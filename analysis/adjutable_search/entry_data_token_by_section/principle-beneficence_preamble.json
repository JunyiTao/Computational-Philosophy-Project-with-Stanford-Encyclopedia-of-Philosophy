    "main_text": "\n\n\nBeneficent actions and motives have traditionally occupied a central\nplace in morality. Common examples today are found in social welfare\nprograms, scholarships for needy and meritorious students, communal\nsupport of health-related research, policies to improve the welfare of\nanimals, philanthropy, disaster relief, programs to benefit children\nand the incompetent, and preferential hiring and admission policies.\nWhat makes these diverse acts beneficent? Are such beneficent acts and\npolicies obligatory or merely the pursuit of optional moral ideals?\n\n\nThese questions have generated a substantial literature on\nbeneficence in both theoretical ethics and applied ethics. In\ntheoretical ethics, the dominant issue in recent years has been how to\nplace limits on the scope of beneficence. In applied and professional\nethics, a number of issues have been treated in the fields of\nbiomedical ethics and business ethics.\n",
