    "main_text": "General Background\n2. General Background\n\nMaritain saw himself as working in continuity with the thought of\nThomas Aquinas, and his writings frequently contain quotations from\nand references to Aquinas\u2019 texts. While his turn to Catholicism\nwas largely due to personal reasons and to the influence of friends,\nhis intellectual itinerary and his defense of Catholic thought and\nThomistic philosophy were undoubtedly determined by events affecting\nhis adopted church. \n\nOne such series of events was the attack on (principally Catholic)\nreligious organisations by secular and humanist forces within the\nFrench state in the early twentieth century, culminating in a number\nof laws affecting the taxation and ownership of church property and\nthe place of religion in public affairs. Another, at about the same\ntime, were those reflecting the tensions within\nCatholicism\u2014particularly in France\u2014in reaction to\ntheological modernism. The writings of George Tyrell in England and\nErnest Renan and Alfred Loisy in France were condemned for such\n\u2018errors\u2019 as claiming that conscience is the primary source\nof religious truth and that all knowledge\u2014including\ndogma\u2014has a historical and contingent character, and so\nchallenging the authoritative character of magisterial pronouncements.\nFurther, the major philosophical traditions in France were seen as\nincompatible with Catholic theology. The dominant schools were the\nspiritualism or intuitionism of Bergson (which held that the emphasis\nin metaphysics on \u2018being\u2019 should be replaced by one on\ndur\u00e9e or pure change), the idealism of L\u00e9on\nBrunschvicg, the spiritualism of Andr\u00e9 Lalande, and the\nmaterialism of Edmond Goblot; each challenged claims that were seen as\nessential to Catholicism. Given this turmoil, there was a call for a\ndefence of the philosophies and the theological teachings of the\nCatholic Church.\n\nMaritain\u2019s early writings, then, sought to address some of the\nconcerns arising out of these events. Having been attracted initially\nto Spinoza\u2019s idealism and, later, to Bergson\u2019s vitalist\nintuitionism, he was able to come to the defense of Catholic thought\nwith a knowledge of its critics that surpassed many of his\ncontemporaries. Maritain rejected\n\u2018modernity\u2019\u2014Cartesian and post-Cartesian\nthought\u2014for what he saw as its emphasis on epistemology over\nmetaphysics, and found an alternative in the \u2018pre-modern\u2019\nviews of Aquinas. Nevertheless, he saw that philosophy had to do more\nthan merely repeat Thomas\u2019 views, and he took it upon himself to\ndevelop some aspects of Thomistic philosophy to address the problems\nof the contemporary world. Thus, though the most profound inspiration\nfor many of Maritain\u2019s ideas was the work of Thomas Aquinas, his\nepistemology and aesthetics show also the influence of Christian\nmysticism, particularly that of St John of the Cross, and his social\nand political philosophy clearly reflects many of the ideals of\nEuropean liberalism.\n",
