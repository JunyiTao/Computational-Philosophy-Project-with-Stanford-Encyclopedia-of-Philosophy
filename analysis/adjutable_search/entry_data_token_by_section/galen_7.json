    "main_text": "Epistemology: Demonstration, Scientific Method, Human Knowledge || The Notion of Scientific Progress\n3.5 The Notion of Scientific Progress\nGalen explicitly states that, using theoretical reasoning in conjunction with empirical evidence, progress in knowledge is possible. At the same time\u2014a perception typical within Graeco-Roman culture\u2014he regards the pathway from the \u201cancients\u201d, in particular Hippocrates, to the moderns as in general a downward one, and \u201cmore recent\u201d, in relation to medical or scientific authors, is usually a term of disapprobation. He does, however, claim that progress in relation to the ancients is possible, and indeed that he has achieved it, in two chief senses. One is that, for example in anatomy, he has made certain specific discoveries unknown to his predecessors; the other, more substantial in his presentation, is the project of giving solid demonstrative form to propositions which (according to Galen) were known to the ancients, but either stated by them without demonstration, or actually omitted from their writings (Opt. Med. 4, 34; Hankinson 1994a).\nIt is important to consider the historically specific attitude to authority\u2014to \u201cthe ancients\u201d\u2014that is in play here. As we have seen, Galen apparently regards certain propositions as evident to reason which we might rather think are \u201cendoxic\u201d, or indeed simply well established in traditional thought. More specifically, Galen has an enormous explicit admiration for certain authors already regarded as classical in his time, most especially Hippocrates and Plato, and devotes lengthy texts to their exegesis. He is both influenced by previous authors and exercised to present his own views as consistent with a body of traditional thought. But his latter process is not a straightforward or uncritical one: different sets of authors are lined up as authority in different contexts; and authors highly respected in certain contexts become the object of fierce criticism in others. (On these issues see Lloyd 1988, 1993; Singer 1996, 2013, Ch. 4, 2021a; Vegetti 1999; von Staden 2009.) Galen explicitly states that he does not rely on Hippocrates, \u201cas others do\u201d, uncritically or reverentially, but rather quotes him because he sees \u201cthat his demonstrations are secure\u201d (QAM 9, 399\u2013400). So, too, with Plato: although agreeing with much of Platonic doctrine as he understands it, and in a sense appearing to present himself \u201ctribally\u201d as a Platonist, Galen is quite capable of disagreeing with Plato on points of detail.\nYet the very fact that Galen\u2019s major treatise on psycho-physiology, PHP, is formally presented as a reconciliation of Hippocrates\u2019 and Plato\u2019s views is telling\u2014as indeed is the huge volume of exegetical work on Hippocrates, and on Aristotelian logic. In practice, arguments from authority have considerable value for Galen, at least as a persuasive tool, in spite of his explicit denials of that authority status; and there are undoubtedly cultural and historical reasons for his devotion to Plato and Hippocrates in particular (see von Staden 1997; Vegetti 1999; Gill et al. 2009). However, his claim not to be a slavish sectarian is borne out; and no one\u2014not Aristotle, not Plato, not even Hippocrates\u2014is exempt from criticism in particular contexts.\n",
