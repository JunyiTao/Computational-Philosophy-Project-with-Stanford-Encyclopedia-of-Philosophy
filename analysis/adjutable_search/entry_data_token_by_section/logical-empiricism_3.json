    "main_text": "Issues\n4. Issues\n\nIt is not possible in an essay of this scope to trace all the issues\nthat the logical empiricists addressed or even to treat any one of\nthem with completeness. What is possible is to highlight some salient\nissues, clear away some misconceptions about them, and sketch a bit\nhow those issues were developed over time. The first is a related set\nof concerns: empiricism, verificationism, and anti-metaphysics. The\nsecond is the logical empiricists\u2019 treatment of logic and\nmathematics as analytic. Third is the related issues of the unity of\nscience and reduction. And finally, comes the issue of probability.\nGiven what has already been said, the reader should be aware that none\nof the doctrines discussed below was shared by all members of the\nlogical empiricist movement.\n",
