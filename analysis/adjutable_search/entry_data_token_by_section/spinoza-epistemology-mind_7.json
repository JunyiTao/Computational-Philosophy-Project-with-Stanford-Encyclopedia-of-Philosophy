    "main_text": "Philosophy of mind || Willing or affirming\n2.4 Willing or affirming\n\nSpinoza\u2019s account of willing is developed in opposition to\nDescartes\u2019s account, on several fronts. First, and perhaps most\nfamously, Spinoza denies that human beings have a free\n(undetermined) will (E1app; G/II/78). The freedom that Descartes finds\nundeniable in introspection is for Spinoza only a manifestation of the\ndepths of our ignorance about how we actually have been determined to\nact. Second, Descartes had proposed that we distinguish intellect as a\nfaculty for forming representations, from will as a faculty for\njudging the truth value of these representations. Spinoza rejects both\nthe idea that there are any faculties over and above\nparticular ideas and volitions (cf. 2.1.1), and the separation of the\nrepresentational and volitional elements. Instead he proposes that we\nsee the volitional element as intrinsic to representation,\nsuch that we \u201caffirm insofar as [we] perceiv[e]\u201d (E2p49s\n[III.B(ii)]; G/II/134). In consequence Spinozistic ideas are\nbelief-like: they \u201caffirm\u201d \u2013 posit the\nexistence of \u2013 the things they represent. On this picture, in\nthinking of my dog, for example, I thereby affirm her existence.\n\nOne obvious objection a Cartesian might make to this account is that\nit seems incapable of explaining the familiar experience of merely\nentertaining (imagining, hypothesizing, exploring, etc.) some idea\nwithout committing ourselves to its truth or falsity. As Spinoza puts\nthe objection in the mouth of an imaginary opponent,\n\nsomeone who feigns a winged horse does not on that account grant that\nthere is a winged horse, i.e., he is not on that account\ndeceived\u2026Therefore, experience seems to teach\u2026that the\nwill, or faculty of assenting, is free, and different from the faculty\nof understanding. (E2p49s [III.A.(ii)])\n\n\nTo fend off this objection Spinoza must find a way of explaining the\npossibility of representing something (such as a winged horse) without\ncommitting to its existence, while drawing solely on the resources of\nparticular, intrinsically affirmative ideas. His proposal focuses on\ncountervailing ideas: ideas that affirm or posit something\nthat negates or \u201cexcludes [tollere]\u201d the\nexistence of an object represented by other ideas. For example, a\nchild \u201cimagining a winged horse, and not perceiving anything\nelse\u2026that excludes the existence of the horse\u2026.will\nnecessarily regard the horse as present\u201d (E2p49s [III.B.(ii)];\nG/II/134). But, with some schooling, the child\u2019s original idea\nof a winged horse can be offset by another idea (say, by the rational\nrepresentation of equine bones as, in general, too heavy to be lifted\nby feathers). Spinoza\u2019s proposal explains not only how the\nordinary experience of mere entertainment of ideas is possible, but,\nmore significantly, it arguably offers a genealogy of\nnegation as a basic mental operation derived from affirmation\n(cf. Donagan 1988:46).\n\nThe obvious question Spinoza\u2019s account raises is why, in such\ncases of mental conflict, in which certain ideas \u201cexclude\u201d\none another, should one of these ideas prevail? As Diane Steinberg\nnotes, Spinoza cannot have in mind purely logical\ninconsistency or contradiction between ideas, since this doesn\u2019t\nyet give us a reason to nonarbitrarily prefer one idea over another\n(2003). The psychology of \u201cexclusion\u201d must involve not\nmerely such logical incompatibility of contents, but something that\nwould asymmetrically tip the scales in favor of one idea. Commentators\nhave proposed that greater causal power as the best candidate\nfor this role: the winning idea is the idea with more power to\ncontinue existing and to produce further ideas (in short, greater\npower to \u201cstrive\u201d [E3p7]), or greater power to determine\nthe mind\u2019s activity or causal power as a whole (e.g. Della Rocca\n2003; J. Steinberg 2018b).\n\n(On affirmation, will and excluding ideas see also 3.2.2. On\n\u201cfictions\u201d, see e.g. D. Garrett 2018: ch. 5, J. Steinberg\n2018b; on striving, see e.g. Carriero 2011, Kisner 2011, LeBuffe 2010,\nViljanen 2011, Youpa 2020 and entry on\n Spinoza\u2019s psychological theory.)\n",
