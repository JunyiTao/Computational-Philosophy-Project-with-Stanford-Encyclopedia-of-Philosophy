    "main_text": "Philosophy of Mathematics\n5. Philosophy of Mathematics\nLike most of Brentano\u2019s students, Ehrenfels also wrote various\nworks on the philosophy of mathematics: first of all his 1885\ndissertation on\n\u201cGr\u00f6\u00dfenrelationen und Zahlen:\neine psychologische Studie\u201d (\u201cRelations of Magnitude\nand Numbers: a Psychological Study\u201d), then his article\n\u201cZur Philosophie der Mathematik\u201d (\u201cOn the\nPhilosophy of Mathematics\u201d) in 1891, the same year as\nHusserl\u2019s Philosophy of Arithmetic, and finally in 1922\nhis booklet on Das Primzahlengesetz (The Law of\nPrime Numbers). As Simons (1988, 10) observes, his early\nmathematical works are representative of the Brentanian approach as it\ncan also be found in Husserl\u2019s and Stumpf\u2019s habilitation\nworks.\nIndeed, in his (Ehrenfels 1885, Ierna 2017a) dissertation Ehrenfels\npresents an account of the concept of number and the philosophy of\nmathematics that is for the most part the traditional Brentanian one,\nthough unsurprisingly including many Meinongian elements. Ehrenfels\nclaims that by abstracting from all particularities of two objects and\nconsidering them merely as the foundations of a relation of difference,\nwe obtain the concept of two. If we then add another object, we need to\ncompare and distinguish not only the first-order relations among the\nfoundations, but also the second-order relation of difference among the\nfirst-order relations of difference, and so on for every additional\nelement. This leads to a rapid increase in complication, as illustrated\nin Husserl\u2019s critique of such an approach in the second chapter\nof the Philosophy of Arithmetic. Ehrenfels likewise concludes\nthat this process of distinction soon leads beyond our limited\npresentational capacities and requires more convenient, though\nindirect, ways of presenting numbers. Hence, he argues that higher\nnumbers can only be reached by successive presentations of partial\nnumbers, e.g. nine by three times three.\nEhrenfels presents an interesting account of the golden ratio\n(1:1.618) as the point where the relations of similarity and difference\nare in balance, i.e., two magnitudes that stand to each other in the\ngolden ratio are as similar as they are different. Towards the end of\nthe work Ehrenfels\u2019 discussion of higher-order relations and of\ncomparisons of relations independently of their foundations leads him\ninto formulations that could be seen as anticipating his later concept\nof Gestalt qualities.\nIn his article on the philosophy of mathematics Ehrenfels starts\nwith an analysis of the presentation of number and the concepts of\nunity and multiplicity. He denies an empirical basis to number\npresentations: \u201cThe presentation of number is not extracted from\nexternal perception, but is actually inserted into it\u201d (Ehrenfels\n1891, 287). Ehrenfels takes relations of difference as the foundation\nfor the concept of multiplicity and goes on to describe the\nconstruction of numbers through counting, by successive addition of\nunities (Ehrenfels 1891, 289 ff.). Like other Brentanists, he comments\non the limits of our cognitive capacities and points out that we can\nhave a presentation of higher numbers only indirectly, i.e.,\nsymbolically (Ehrenfels 1891, 292, also see 289 where he refers to\nHusserl 1887). Ehrenfels here chooses the Meinongian terminology,\nspeaking of indirect or founded contents (see his notes on 292 ff.), but\nalso follows Brentano\u2019s approach when remarking on the power of\nsigns to function as surrogates for presentations (Ehrenfels 1891,\n296). He gives an extensive critique of Kant\u2019s famous doctrine\nthat \u201c7+5=12\u201d would be an example of a synthetic\nproposition a priori, with a quite idiosyncratic argumentation, stating\nthat the a priori or a posteriori character of the\nsum would depend on the possibility of a direct intuition of its\nelements, i.e., a proper presentation. If we have to externalize the\nprocess by use of signs when the numbers exceed our cognitive\ncapacities, then how can we claim to be able to perform such\ncalculations a priori? Ehrenfels lists several examples that\ninvolve external aids, such as the use of logarithmic tables: looking\nup a number on a list is hardly an \u201ca priori\u201d\ncognitive act (Ehrenfels 1891, 329). The interesting aspect of his\napproach is that he takes mathematics in this way as an essentially\ncomputational science, relying on external artifacts (\u201cphysical\naides\u201d) and hence as a science which necessarily has a large\na posteriori component (Ehrenfels 1891, 331). In the second\nhalf of the article, however, Ehrenfels provides a critique of J.S.\nMill and empiricism in mathematics, along the same lines as Stumpf had\ndone in his habilitation work. Like Husserl and fellow Meinong-student\nKonrad Zindler, he points out that in the progress of calculation with\nsigns one often hits on \u201cunpresentable\u201d combinations, i.e.,\ncombinations of signs that cannot be combined into a proper\npresentation (Ehrenfels 1891, 342). Yet, these \u201cimpossible\u201d\ncombinations do then lead to correct results. (This paragraph is based\nin part on Ierna 2011).\nEhrenfels himself assigns an important biographical role to his\nlast major work in the philosophy of mathematics, while its actual\nphilosophical and mathematical significance is much more modest, as we\nwill see. Ehrenfels states in the preface to Das\nPrimzahlengesetz that, after a long depression following WWI, the\ncontemplation of the \u201cfield of numbers and their eternal,\nnecessary connections\u201d soothed his agonized spirit\n(\u201cWeltangst\u201d) (Ehrenfels 1922, III). In the preface\nto the work he retraces the development of the core idea of the book,\ndescribing very poetically how in April 1919 the idea\n\u201cblossomed\u201d in his mind about the distribution of prime\nnumbers (Ehrenfels 1922, IV: \u201cAn einem warmen Aprilvormittag\n1919 ist mir \u2013 in der Sonne gelagert neben der Gruft meines\nVaters \u2013 \u201eder Knopf aufgegangen\u201d f\u00fcr das\nWesentliche der L\u00f6sung.\u201d) Ehrenfels himself at first took\nit only as a rediscovery of already well-established mathematical\ninsights, but having been informed by his friend and colleague the\nmathematician Gerhard Kowalewski that the matter of the distribution\nof primes was far from settled, Ehrenfels tried to work out his idea\nin a more systematic fashion, convinced to have hit on something new\nand worthwhile.\nEhrenfels\u2019 core idea in Das Primzahlengesetz\nis to apply the notion of Gestalt to number series to find the\nlaw-like regularities in the distribution of prime numbers. Therefore\nEhrenfels decided to include the entire text of his 1890 article\n\u201c\u00dcber Gestaltqualit\u00e4ten\u201d in the work,\nunchanged, though split into two parts. In the course of his\ndiscussion, Ehrenfels once again goes down the familiar road of\nBrentanist mathematics: a discussion of proper and symbolic\npresentations of number, the limits of our presentational capacity,\nproper number conceptions as based on (higher order) relations of\ndistinction, etc. (Ehrenfels 1922, 30 ff.) He explicitly considers the\nproper number presentations as Gestalt qualities, and to be\nprecise, as presentations of \u201csecond order\u201d. Collections of\nnumbers, which he calls Zahlenfiguren, would be of third\norder. These number figures play a central role in, literally,\n\u201cfiguring out\u201d the prime numbers: by generating series of\nnumber figures corresponding to all multiples of a base number, which\ncan then be combined in such a way as to filter out the primes.\nHowever, in the end the result of this procedure turns out to be\nquite trivial from a mathematical perspective: \u201cIt actually\nmerely leads to a simplification of the method known as the\n\u201cSieve of Eratosthenes\u201d already being practiced for more\nthan 2000 years\u201d (Ehrenfels 1922, 48). The method of the sieve\nconsists in identifying and then eliminating all divisible numbers by\ngenerating them from multiplications of primes. If one wants to find\nall the prime numbers between 0 and 100, one would proceed by striking\nall multiples of two, then all multiples of three, etc. until only the\nprimes remain. Ehrenfels\u2019 approach shortens the process by\navoiding repeated strikings, as would happen e.g. with 6 as multiple of\nboth 2 and 3 (Ehrenfels 1922, 49). As Simons (1986, 112) argues, this\nis merely computationally faster than the traditional method of the\nsieve of Eratosthenes (but slower than other methods, as experimentally\nverified by Simons 1988, 12), but not a substantially new\nalgorithm.\n",
