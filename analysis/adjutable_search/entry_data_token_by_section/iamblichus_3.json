    "main_text": "Iamblichus\u2019 Place in Greek Neoplatonism || Exegesis\n2.2 Exegesis\n\nOne of the most conspicuous of Iamblichus\u2019 contributions to\nemerging Neoplatonism regards his views on exegesis. A typical Late\nAntique intellectual in this respect, Iamblichus considers the written\nwork of authoritative figures to be sacred and claims to be a mere\ninterpreter of their true, deeper meaning (nous).\n\nFour overarching principles govern Iamblichus\u2019 exegetical\npractice. First, the idea that every authoritative work is fully\nself-consistent and strives to demonstrate a certain thesis which acts\nas its \u201cgoal\u201d or \u201ctarget\u201d (skopos).\nThis principle is applied rigorously: for instance, since the\nskopos of the Timaeus is the theory of nature, this\nmeans that even the work\u2019s prologue, however autonomous it may\nseem at first glance, should be interpreted in this way (In\nTimaeum [D-1973: Fr. 3]). This amounts to considering literary\nworks living organisms, in accordance with what Plato writes in\nPhaedrus 264C (see Coulter 1976: 73). Guidelines to\ndetermining a given work\u2019s skopos are found in a late\nanonymous composition, the Prolegomena to Platonic Philosophy\n(\u00a7\u00a7 21\u201323).\n\nThe same source (\u00a7 26) provides a list of twelve Platonic\ndialogues (10 + 2) which, according to Iamblichus, offer an overview\nof his philosophy and thus encompass the whole theory of reality. The\nlist starts with the Alcibiades, taken as an introduction to\nphilosophy and thought to contain the first ten dialogues, as if it\nwere a \u201cseed\u201d (In Alcibiadem [D-1973: Fr. 1). The\nremaining dialogues are subsequently arranged according to the\ndifferent branches of philosophy (as Porphyry had done with\nPlotinus\u2019 Enneads), while the Aristotelian distinction\nbetween praxis and the\u014dria is simultaneously\ntaken into account. Praxis or ethics is exemplified by the\nGorgias and the Phaedo, the former representing\npolitics, the latter catharsis (in accordance with Iamblichus\u2019\nconception of virtues, on which see below,\n Section 7.2).\n Then comes the\u014dria where, as it seems, the\nCratylus and the Theaetetus are taken to provide\nPlato\u2019s account of logic (the former teaching names, the latter\nconcepts); then come the Sophist and the Politicus,\nwhich supposedly deal with physics\u2014however strange this may seem\nto us\u2014and finally the Phaedrus and the\nSymposium, which deal with theology. The crowning dialogue in\nthe first cycle is the Philebus, because its skopos\nis the all-transcendent Good. Then, as a recapitulation of the first\ncycle, we find a second one consisting in only two works (both of\nwhich, remarkably, feature main characters other than Socrates): the\nTimaeus and the Parmenides, the former subordinated\nto the latter as physics is to theology, although both display a\ndegree of perfection and thus are expected to embrace the whole of\nPlato\u2019s philosophy. This curriculum principle, then, was\nsupposed to bring an author\u2019s \u0153uvre into\naccordance with itself, just as the skopos postulated organic\nunity in a single text.\n\nAll that was left at this point was to establish harmony between\ndifferent authors; and this is where sumph\u014dnia or\n\u201cagreement\u201d comes into play. Building on Porphyry\u2019s\nefforts (as opposed to Plotinus\u2019 views), Iamblichus fully\nintegrated Aristotle into Platonism (see\n Section 5\n below); he also took into account Pythagoras and the\npseudo-Pythagorean corpus (see\n Section 4.3).\n References to other schools are scarce and mostly critical.\nIamblichus\u2019 philosophical authorities, then, are Plato,\nAristotle, and the Pythagoreans; they were complemented by several\ntexts held to be divinely inspired, of which the two most important\nones are the Chaldean Oracles (a second-century collection of\nverse oracles which provide a Platonic-influenced revelation mostly\nbased on the Timaeus, and which develop a dualistic view\nabout matter and a divine energy called \u201cfire\u201d) and the\npseudo-Orphic Rhapsodies in 24 books. The Chaldean\nOracles at least are known to have been commented upon by\nIamblichus, in a huge commentary comprising at least 28 books\n(Damascius, De Principiis II, 1.5\u20138). (on\nIamblichus\u2019 religious views, see below,\n Section 6.3.)\n",
