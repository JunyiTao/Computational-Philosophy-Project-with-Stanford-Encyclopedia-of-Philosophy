Neurobiological Theories of Consciousness\n\nRecall that the Generic Consciousness question asks:\n\n\nWhat conditions/states N of nervous systems are necessary and/or\nsufficient for a mental state, M, to be conscious as opposed to\nnot?\n\n\nVictor Lamme notes:\n\n\nDeciding whether there is phenomenality in a mental representation\nimplies putting a boundary\u2014drawing a line\u2014between\ndifferent types of representations\u2026We have to start from the\nintuition that consciousness (in the phenomenal sense) exists, and is\na mental function in its own right. That intuition immediately implies\nthat there is also unconscious information processing. (Lamme\n2010: 208)\n\n\nIt is uncontroversial that there is unconscious information\nprocessing, say processing occurring in a computer. What Lamme means\nis that there are conscious and unconscious mental states\n(representations). For example, there might be visual states of seeing\nX that are conscious or not\n (section 4).\n\nIn what follows, the theories discussed provide higher level neural\nproperties that are necessary and/or sufficient for generic\nconsciousness of a given state. To provide a gloss on the hypotheses:\nFor the Global Neuronal Workspace, entry into the neural workspace is\nnecessary and sufficient for a state or content to be consciousness.\nFor Recurrent Processing Theory, a type of recurrent processing in\nsensory areas is necessary and sufficient for perceptual\nconsciousness, so entry into the Workspace is not necessary. For\nHigher-Order Theories, the presence of a higher-order state tied to\nprefrontal areas is necessary and sufficient for phenomenal\nexperience, so recurrent processing in sensory areas is not necessary\nnor is entry into the workspace. For Information Integration Theories,\na type of integration of information is necessary and sufficient for a\nstate to be conscious.\n",
