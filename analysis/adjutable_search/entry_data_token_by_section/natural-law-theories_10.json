Legally?\n\n\nIn such a case, does the law as settled by social-fact sources, in\nlosing its directiveness for judges and citizens, lose also its legal\nvalidity?  The answer depends upon the discursive context in which the\nquestion arises. If a course of reflection or discourse makes it\nappropriate to acknowledge the rule\u2019s \u201csettled\u201d or\n\u201cposited\u201d character as cognizable by reference to\nsocial-fact sources, one can say that it is legally valid though too\nunjust to be obeyed or applied. Or if the discursive context makes it\nappropriate instead to point up its lack of directiveness for judges\nand subjects alike, one can say that the rule, despite its links to\nsocial-fact sources, is not only not morally directive but is also\nlegally invalid. Each way of speaking tells an important part of the\ntruth, or rather, tells the truth with an emphasis which differs from\nthe other\u2019s.\n\n                 \nThe meaning of \u201can unjust law is not a law\u201d is essentially\nidentical to Hart\u2019s \u201cThis is law but too iniquitous to be\napplied or obeyed\u201d (or availed of as a defense). The excitement\nand hostility aroused amongst modern legal theorists (notably Hart) by\nthe former way of speaking is unwarranted. No one has difficulty in\nunderstanding locutions such as \u201can invalid argument is no\nargument,\u201d \u201ca disloyal friend is not a friend,\u201d\n\u201ca quack medicine is not medicine,\u201d and so\nforth. \u201cLex iniusta non est lex\u201d has the same\nlogic; it acknowledges, in its opening words, that what is in question\nis in certain important respects\u2014perhaps normally and\npresumptively decisive respects\u2014a law, but then in\nits withdrawal or denial of that predicate it affirms that, since\njustice is the very point of having and respecting law at all, this\nparticular law\u2019s deficiency in justice deprives it of the decisive\nsignificance which all law purports to have. It is thus law only in a\nsense that should be judged\u2014especially when law is regarded, as\nby Hart himself, as a kind of reason or purported reason for \naction\u2014to be a distorted and secondary, non-central sense.\n\n\nNote:  Classical political theory, as expounded by Plato, Aristotle and\nAquinas, makes regular use of this distinction between central and\nperverted or otherwise marginal instances of an analogical concept or\nterm, and so Aquinas never says simply \u201cunjust law is not\nlaw\u201d but rather \u201cunjust law is not straightforwardly or\nunqualifiedly [simpliciter] law\u201d or \u201cis a\nperversion of law\u201d, and similar statements. Still, he does\nelsewhere say that \u201can unjust judgment [of a court] is not a\njudgment\u201d and it seems clear that he might similarly have used\nthe simplified or slogan-form locution, about law, as short-hand. \n\n\n\n\nAll this seems to have been overlooked by Hart in his polemic (Hart\n1961, 204\u20137; 1994, 208\u201312) against \u201clex iniusta\nnon est lex.\u201d Hart\u2019s argument that use of the slogan must\ntend to discourage or confuse the moral critique of law seems\nhistorically and logically indefensible. The slogan is unintelligible\nsave as an expression of and incitement to engaging in such critiques;\nit can scarcely be rejected without first misquoting it, as Hart and\nthose who employ his argument almost invariably do, averting their\ngaze from the slogan\u2019s first predication and implied assertion: that the\nunjust rule in question is a rule of law.\n\n\nSome theories have adopted certain main tenets of natural law theory,\nand professed to be natural law theories, but have asserted that even\nthe most unjust laws create an obligation to obey which is both legal\nand moral. Kant\u2019s (see Alexy 2002, 117\u2013121) is such a theory: a\nlegal system can consist entirely of positive law but must be\n\u201cpreceded by a natural law that establishe[s] the legislator\u2019s\nauthority\u2026to bind others simply by his arbitrary action.\u201d\nBut this purported natural-law basic norm looks not to the justice of\nthe content of the posited legal rules, but exclusively to the need\nfor legal certainty and civic peace, which Kant takes to exclude any\nright to resist unjust laws and any denial that they are fully\nlegal. Alexy has pointed out the confusions and inconsistencies in\nKant\u2019s attempts to evade the classic position that laws whose\ninjustice is sufficiently grave can and should be denied to have the\nlegal character predicable of laws that citizens and courts, precisely\nas courts, are morally and juridically entitled to treat as\u2014or\nas if they are\u2014not law. In this as in many other respects,\nseventeenth and eighteenth century philosophical developments (like\ntheir twentieth and twenty-first century counterparts) were not so\nmuch progress as regress. But precisely how the classic position\nitself should be formulated, explained and applied today is debated\nbetween Alexy, Finnis and others (Alexy 2013; Finnis 2014; Crowe 2019).\n",
