    "main_text": "The Judgment of Taste || Recasting Normativity\n1.3 Recasting Normativity\n\nIn the normative claim of judgments of taste, as formulated above,\nother people do not figure in the account. This is an\naustere explanation of what Kant meant, or perhaps of what he\nought to have meant, when he said that the judgment of taste claims\n\u201cuniversal validity\u201d, by contrast with judgments about the\nniceness of Canary-wine. Given this account, we can\nexplain the fact that we think that others ought to share our\njudgment. They ought to share it on pain of making a judgment which is\nincorrect or inappropriate. And this would be why we do in\nfact look to others to share our judgment; we do not want them to make\nincorrect judgments. It seems that Kant\u2019s reference to other\npeople in characterizing the normativity of judgments of taste has\ndropped out of the picture as inessential.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether Kant would go along with this, for he\ncharacterizes normativity in a way that ties in with his eventual\nexplanation of its possibility. Kant expresses the normative\nidea in a very particular way. He writes:\n\n\n[we] demand such assent universally (Kant 1790, 5: 214 [2000: 99])\n\n\nAnd Kant says that the judgment of taste involves\n\n\nits validity for everyone. (Kant 1790, 5: 212 [2000: 97])\n\n\nBy contrast, Kant thinks that although we sometimes speak as\nif our judgments of the agreeable are universally valid\n(\u201cLamb tastes better with garlic\u201d), in fact they are not:\njudgments of the agreeable appeal only to most but not to\nall people (Kant 1790, 5: 213 [2000: 98]).\n\nHowever, the austere characterization attempts to catch a more basic\nidea of normativity\u2014one that might serve as the target of rival\nexplanations. In order to explain how subjectively universal judgments\nare possible, Kant has a complicated story about the harmonious\ninterplay of the cognitive faculties\u2014imagination and\nunderstanding\u2014which he thinks constitutes pleasure in beauty\n(Kant 1790, 5: 219 [2000: 104]). This \u201cdeep\u201d account of\npleasure in beauty is highly controversial and not particularly\nplausible (see Budd 2001). But we can see why Kant gives it. For Kant,\nthe normative claim of the judgment of taste has its roots in the more\ngeneral workings of our cognitive faculties, which Kant thinks we can\nassume others share. Thus, we have the beginnings of an explanation of\nhow such a pleasure can ground a judgment that makes a universal\nclaim. However, Kant does not have much to say about the nature of the\n\u201cuniversality\u201d or normativity that is being explained by\nsuch a speculative account of pleasure in beauty. It is no accident\nthat Kant phrases the obligation in interpersonal terms, considering\nwhere he is going. And it is no great fault on his part that he does\nso. But for our purposes, we need to separate what is being explained\nfrom its explanation. For if Kant\u2019s explanation does not work,\nwe want to be left with a characterization of the normativity he was\ntrying to explain. We need to separate Kant\u2019s problem from his\nsolution, so that the former is left if the latter fails. There may be\nalternative solutions to his problem.\n",
