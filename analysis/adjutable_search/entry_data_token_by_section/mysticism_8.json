    "main_text": "The Attributes of Mystical Experience || Ineffability\n3.2 Ineffability\n\nWhen classical mystics invoke \u201cineffability,\u201d it is typically to\naffirm that there is more to what was experienced that can be\nexpressed in any language, not to deny anything can be said about that\nreality. But William James (1958, 292\u201393) deemed absolute\nineffability or indescribability to be an essential mark of\nmysticism. Even indirect depictions of what is experienced through\nanalogies, metaphors, and art turn it into something like a\nphenomenal object and thus must ultimately be denied. Moreover, it is\nnot always clear whether it is the experience or its alleged\nobject or both that is considered ineffable by a given\nmystic.\n\nA logical problem with ineffability was noted long ago by Augustine:\nGod should not be said to be ineffable, for to say that X is\nineffable is to say something about X, which\ncontravenes ineffability (Augustine 1958, 10\u201311). This\nproblem has been raised by Alvin Plantinga (1980, 23\u201325) and\nKeith Yandell (1975).\n\nSeveral responses to this problem are possible. One is to avoid speech\naltogether and remain silent about what is revealed in experience.\nMystics, however, have not been very good at this. A second is to\ndistinguish first-order from second-order attributions, where\n\u201cineffability\u201d is a second-order term solely about all\nfirst-order phenomenal descriptive terms (Jones 2016, 204\u2013208).\nThat is, to say that something is ineffable would be to assert\nthat it could not be described by any first-order terms, including\n\u201cineffable.\u201d A third possibility is to say that \u201cX is\nineffable\u201d is really a statement about the\nterm \u201cX,\u201d saying about it that it fails to\nrefer to any describable entity.\n\nA fourth possibility lies in the ongoing negation of whatever is\nsaid about X ad infinitum in an infinite\n\u201cunsaying\u201d or taking back of what has been said (Sells 1994,\nchap. 1). An example of unsaying can be found in the endless negations\nin some Zen Buddhist meditative exercises. Since the truth about\nreality \u201cas it is\u201d lies outside of our conceptualizations of it,\nwe cannot say that truth, only experience it. Hence,\nwhen we say, \u201cReality is not reality\u201d (i.e., that reality as\nit is differs from what we take it to be conceptually), we must also\nsay that \u201cReality is not not-reality\u201d to counter an affirmation\nof its nature as not-reality. We must then negate the latter by saying\n\u201cReality is neither not-reality nor not-not-reality.\u201d And so on. (See\nNhat Hanh, 1994, chap. 5.) But classical mystics typically affirmed,\nas Shankara did with Brahman, that a reality lay behind all\nnegations. So too, Eckhart prayed to God to make him free of God\n(Eckhart 2009, 424, 531) \u2014 it is not a denial of God but an\nattempt to get to the Godhead behind God and creation.\n\nWilliam Alston (1991) offers a fifth possibility: when mystics\ntalk about \u201cindescribability,\u201d they refer only to the difficulty\nof describing in literal terms rather than by metaphor, analogy,\nand symbols.\n\nA sixth solution comes from Richard Gale and Ninian Smart each of\nwhom have argued that \u201cineffability\u201d is merely an honorific\ntitle marking the value and intensity of an experience a mystic\nconsiders profound (Gale 1960; Smart 1958, 69). \n\nAs another possibility, Wayne Proudfoot (1985, 125\u201327)\nargues that invoking ineffability is not to\ndescribe but to prescribe that no language shall be\napplicable, and so serves to create and maintain a protective sense of\nmystery. However, experiences of ineffability occur in art\nand music (Gallope 2017) and in everyday experience. Think of the\nimpossibility of describing the taste of coffee to someone who has\nnever tasted it (King 1988). This diminishes the \u201cprotective\nstrategies\u201d argument.\n\nSome philosophers think that a stress on ineffability signifies an\nattempt to consign mysticism to the irrational, thus excluding it\nfrom more sensible human pursuits, or consign them to the realm of the\nemotions (Jantzen 1995, 344). Others have staunchly defended the\nrationality of mysticism against charges of irrationalism\n(Staal 1975; Jones 2016, chap. 7).\n",
