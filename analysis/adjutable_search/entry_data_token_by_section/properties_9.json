    "main_text": "Exemplification || Monist vs. Pluralist Accounts\n2.1 Monist vs. Pluralist Accounts\n\nWe have taken for granted that there is just one kind of\nexemplification, applying indifferently to different categories of\nentities. This monist option may indeed be considered the\ndefault one. A typical recent case of a philosopher who endorses it is\nArmstrong (1997). He distinguishes three basic\ncategories,\u00a0particulars, properties or relations, and states of\naffairs, and takes exemplification as cutting across them: properties\nand relations are exemplified not only by particulars, but by\nproperties or relations and states of affairs as well. But some\nphilosophers are pluralist: they distinguish different kinds\nof exemplification, in relation to categorial distinctions in their\nontology.\n\nOne may perhaps attribute different kinds of exemplification to the\nabove-considered Meinongians in view of the different sorts of\npredication that they admit (see, e.g., Monaghan\u2019s (2011)\ndiscussion of Zalta\u2019s theory). A more typical example of the\npluralist alternative is however provided by Lowe (2006), who\ndistinguishes \u201cinstantiation\u201d,\n\u201ccharacterization\u201d and \u201cexemplification\u201d in\nhis account of four fundamental categories: objects, and three\ndifferent sorts of properties, namely kinds (substantial universals),\nattributes and modes\n (tropes).[7]\n To illustrate, Fido is a dog insofar as it instantiates the\nkind dog, \\(D\\), which in turn is characterized by\nthe attribute of barking, \\(B\\). Hence, when Fido is barking, it\nexemplifies \\(B\\) occurrently by virtue of being\ncharacterized by a barking mode, \\(b\\), that instantiates \\(B\\); and,\nwhen Fido is silent, it exemplifies \\(B\\) dispositionally,\nsince \\(D\\), which Fido instantiates, is characterized by\n\\(B\\)\u00a0(see Gorman 2014 for a critical discussion of this sort of\nview).\n",
