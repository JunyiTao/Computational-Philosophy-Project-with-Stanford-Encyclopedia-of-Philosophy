The Port-Royal Logic used terminology that translates as\n\u201ccomprehension\u201d and \u201cdenotation\u201d for\nthis. John Stuart Mill used \u201cconnotation\u201d and\n\u201cdenotation.\u201d Frege famously used \u201cSinn\u201d and\n\u201cBedeutung,\u201d often left untranslated, but when translated,\nthese usually become \u201csense\u201d and \u201creference.\u201d\nCarnap settled on \u201cintension\u201d and \u201cextension.\u201d\nHowever expressed, and with variation from author to author, the\nessential dichotomy is that between what a term means, and\nwhat it denotes. \u201cThe number of the planets\u201d\ndenotes the number 9 (ignoring recent disputes about the status of\nbodies at the outer edges of the solar system), but it does not have\nthe number 9 as its meaning, or else in earlier times scientists might\nhave determined that the number of planets was 9 through a process of\nlinguistic analysis, and not through astronomical observation. Of the\nmany people who have contributed to the analysis of intensional\nproblems several stand out. At the head of the list is Gottlob Frege.\n",
