    "main_text": "A Second Form of Philosophical Anarchism || The Humean Attack on Tacit Consent\n4.9 The Humean Attack on Tacit Consent\n\n\nDavid Hume criticized this interpretive move (Hume 1965). He argued\nthat given the extraordinary costs to most people of moving out of the\ncountry of their birth, no one can sensibly interpret the voluntary\ncontinued residence of a person in a state as a case of tacit consent.\nHe draws an analogy with a person who has been carried involuntarily\nonto a ship by others and who now finds himself on the ship subject to\nthe commands of the captain and whose only alternative is to throw\nhimself into a stormy sea. Hume argues that such a person's remaining\non the ship can not be interpreted to be consenting to the authority of\nthe captain. The person is merely attempting to avoid the terrible cost\nof getting off the ship.\n\n\nBut it is not clear why Hume's argument is supposed to work. It\nsounds like the argument challenges the voluntariness of the consent.\nBut this cannot be a conclusive argument here. After all, many people\nconsent to things in order to avoid the terrible costs of not\nconsenting. People consent to pay their insurance premiums in order not\nto end up without health care when the time comes that they need it.\nPromises made on the battlefield to lay down arms on the condition that\nthe opponent will not harm one are also made under severe duress. But\nwe do not think that these promises are invalid or that they fail to\nobligate. So the fact that the alternative would be terrible is not a\nreason to think that those who choose to remain in a state are not\nthereby bound.\n\n\nOf course, Hume's example includes the fact that the person was\ncarried forcibly onto the ship. This may be doing more work that it\nshould be. For few people would say that the state has necessarily done\nsomething wrong by imposing its jurisdiction over a territory on which\na person is born. We need, then, to change Hume's example so that the\nperson who is on the boat is on it through no fault of anyone on the\nboat, though he may have ended up there involuntarily.\n\n\nOne possibility is that Hume thinks that we cannot interpret the\ncontinuing residence of a person in a state as a case of consent to the\nauthority of the state because we have no reason to think that the\ncontinuing residence was chosen as a result of reflection on whether it\nconstituted consent. The impoverished person who remains in the state\nin which he finds himself gave no thought whatsoever to any\nconsideration other than that to move would be highly costly or\notherwise unpleasant. We have no reason to think that he gave any\nthought to the question of consent and so it is illegitimate to\ninterpret his behavior in that way.\n\n\nBut it is not obvious that this reasoning succeeds. If a person\nbenefits by residing in a territory and everyone knows that the\nbenefit only arises because of the obedience to law of the members,\nshouldn't it be clear to this person that his compliance is expected\nof him if he remains in the territory? And does his remaining in the\nterritory thereby imply that he consents to the authority of the\nterritory?\n\n\nOf course it is true of any particular person that his\ncompliance is not necessary to the maintenance of the benefits of\npublic order. But at the same time it is clear that unless there is\nsome special reason for this person not to be subject to the rules\neveryone else is subject to, elementary norms of fairness will suggest\nto him and everyone else that compliance is expected of him just as it\nis of everyone else.\n\n\nThis would seem to be a basis for interpreting the person's behavior\nas a case of consent. Anyone can see that the compliance of each person\nis expected of those who reside in a territory as long as the law is\nreasonably just. If someone has not considered these facts, perhaps he\nshould be held responsible for consenting anyway. After all, if we look\nat Simmons's central board room case we might have the same reaction to\nsomeone who, having been told that failure to object implies consent to\na policy, fails to object but only because he doesn't want to anger his\ngirlfriend in the group and really gives no thought to the question of\nconsent. Surely he has tacitly consented, despite his irresponsible\nattitude. So why not think that the person who continues to reside\nvoluntarily in a reasonably just state?\n4.10 How Can Tacit Consent Be A Basis of Political Authority?\n\n\nAn important objection to the idea of tacit consent is that it begs\nthe question about how a state gets its authority. Some argue that a\ngroup of persons that has no authority to issue commands in the first\nplace cannot require people submit to their commands or leave a piece\nof territory they are falsely claim as under their jurisdiction\n(Brilmayer 1989; Wellman 2001). In a variation on the boardroom example\ndescribed above, Brilmayer imagines that instead of the chairman\nproposing a date for a meeting, a window washer swings in and makes the\nsame proposal and asks for objections. Clearly in that case, failure to\nregister objections would not constitute consent to the proposed\nschedule. The reason for this is that only a duly constituted authority\ncan have the right to make such a proposal. But, the claim to authority\nis precisely what tacit consent is supposed to support. So as an\naccount of authority the tacit consent view seems to beg the\nquestion.\n\n\nThis criticism is right as far as it goes. But there are four points\nto note about it. First, it applies to explicit consent as well as\ntacit consent. My consent to a person's doing something does not\nlegitimate that person's doing it nor does it obligate me to respect\nhis doing it unless he already has a right to make the proposal. In the\ncase of political authorities, my consent to someone's issuing commands\nover a piece of territory that she has no right to rule over does not\nlegitimate her commands nor does it obligate me.\n\n\nSecond, it is not a criticism of Locke since he clearly thinks that\ntacit consent only legitimates and obligates under conditions where\nthere is a duly constituted authority. Locke thinks that the right to\nrule of an authority must be traced back to an original act of consent\nin the state of nature (where there is no prior political authority) to\nform a political body. That political body then confers, by the consent\nof all the members, authority on a particular institutional arrangement\n(as long as it is minimally just). The function of tacit consent as\nwell as the consent of new members is simply to renew this already\ncreated authority.\n\n\nThird, if Locke is right and consent can create authority out of the\nstate of nature, it may be possible for tacit consent to do the same.\nWe can imagine a state of nature scenario where a highly persuasive\nperson gets up amid the chaos and makes a proposal to create the\ninitial political body from the state of nature and then states very\nclearly that if there are objections, they should be raised without\nfear. And we can imagine the very same person making a proposal to\ncreate the particular structure of authority over the political body\nand calling for objections in the same way as before. There is no\nobvious reason why this could not work. Locke did not suggest this but\nit does not seem impossible.\n\n\nThese last two points defeat the argument that tacit consent\nrequires a prior duly constituted authority. What Locke's picture\nsuggests is that valid consent or tacit consent do not require that the\nconsented to proposal be made by someone already in authority; they can\nbe valid as long as the proposal is made when there is no authority\nalready in place. The proposals can be drawn up by someone who has the\nright to make the proposal. In the state of nature, anyone presumably\nhas this right.\n\n\nFourth, even if tacit consent cannot establish authority it may\nstill be a necessary condition on the legitimacy of authority. For if a\npolitical authority is duly constituted in the way Locke describes but\nfails to offer its citizens a right of exit or imposes severe burdens\non people who wish to exit, it will become illegitimate over time,\naccording to Locke.\n\n\nStill, this criticism is quite important because it shows that\nneither consent nor tacit consent can stand alone as bases of political\nlegitimacy. An exclusively consent based theory of political authority\nseems to require that the original consent take place in a state of\nnature prior to political authority. And this further requirement seems\nto weaken the plausibility of the view.\n4.11 The Basic Objection of Consent Theorists to Tacit Consent\n\n\nWhat is worrisome about this kind of approach from the standpoint of\nconsent theory is that it seems to ignore all the particular reasons\nthat people may have for not consenting. Indeed, it seems to rely on\nthe premise that anyone should see that if they reside within the\nterritory of a reasonably just state, they are properly expected to\ncomply with the law, at least insofar as it is reasonably just. Consent\ntheory, by contrast, seems to rely on the thought that individuals may\nproperly reject these kinds of obligations for purely personal\nreasons.\n\n\nWe can see a dilemma that arises from the above considerations. If\ntacit consent genuinely arises from voluntary residence in a\nreasonably just state, then it appears that the interpretation of the\nperson's residence does not take account of what many consent\ntheorists have thought was essential to consent theory, namely the\npersonal reasons of the subject in deciding whether to consent or\nnot. On the other hand, if those personal reasons are ones that the\nsubject may properly take into account in deciding whether to consent,\nthen the interpretive move required for voluntary residence to\ngenerate obligations in all subjects of a reasonably just state cannot\nwork. It cannot work because subjects may have personal reasons for\nnot consenting, which voluntary residence does not rule out.\n\n\nHence, it appears that tacit consent theory cannot conform to what\nmany have taken to be the highly individualistic spirit of consent\ntheory. So fans of consent theory are not likely to agree to the idea\nthat people generally tacitly consent to the state's authority when\nthey voluntarily reside in its territory. Critics of consent theory are\nlikely, however, to question that highly individualistic approach in\nthe manner sketched above.\n4.12 Normative Consent\n\n\nDavid Estlund has tentatively advanced a new and intriguing suggestion\nfor shoring up an essentially voluntarist account of\nauthority. Estlund argues that even in the absence of explicit or\ntacit consent in some cases persons may be said to have consented to\npolitical authority.  He describes this as \u201cnormative\nconsent\u201d.  The idea is motivated in the following way.  Estlund\nnotes that actual explicit cases of consenting can fail to produce\nobligations if what is consented to is seriously immoral.  The consent\nis nullified (in its obligation producing effect) by the evident\nimmorality of its content.  Estlund then enquires as to whether the\nlack of consent under certain circumstances mightn't similarly be\nnullified in cases where it is plainly wrong not to consent.  Why\naren't these symmetrical he asks?  Estlund envisions a case in which a\npassenger airplane has crashed and in which there is still a\nsignificant chance of saving many passengers through a very well\ncoordinated effort.  As it happens an airline attendant stands up and\n\u201ctakes control\u201d by giving commands to various people thus\norganizing the relief effort.  Let us suppose that this is evidently\nreasonably successful but that it really does require the cooperation\nof (nearly) everyone to whom the airline attendant chooses to give\ndirectives. And let us suppose that the attendant is not giving any\nclearly immoral commands.  Estlund notes that it would be clearly\nimmoral for someone in a position to give essential help not to agree\nto go along with the attendant's commands.  Now suppose that someone\nin such a situation refuses to consent to the arrangement.  Estlund\nasks whether their non-consent isn't nullified in the light of the\nfact that it is immoral not to consent.  And if the non-consent is\nnullified, then its normal effect in preserving the liberty of the\nagent is not produced.  In this case the person is no longer free to\nact independent of the purported authority.  Since his non-consent is\nnullified, he has, in effect, consented and he is therefore under an\nobligation to the authority.  This is normative consent.\n\n\nEstlund is anxious to distinguish this idea from hypothetical consent\nor what you would have consented to had you been a better person.  Yet\nhe does want to say that this normative consent has a genuine\nconnection to the will.\n\n\nOne might wonder here if there is any genuine connection to the will\nof the normative consenter and so whether this really does shore up\nthe voluntarist view.  But a further issue that might be raised here\nis whether Estlund has genuinely identified the fallback point of\ninvalidated consent and non-consent.  Perhaps the proper description\nof the fall back point is neither consent nor non-consent. A person\nwho has consented to something deeply immoral doesn't thereby refuse\nconsent to that action, the person simply has failed to do anything\nmorally productive.  Perhaps the idea in the case of the seriously\nimmoral non-consent is that the person has simply not done anything\nmorally productive. What happens in both cases is that the previous\nmoral situation of the agent remains in place.  In the nullified\nconsent case you still have an obligation not to do what you consented\nto do and in the nullified non-consent case you still have an\nobligation to do what you refuse to consent to do. This would suggest\nthat the decision between consent and non-consent has here no\nnormative effect: whatever the agent decides, the previous moral\nsituation remains in place.  Hence there is a kind of symmetry that\nholds here between the two cases.  It is just that the default\nposition is neither consent nor non-consent.  The one implication this\nmight have is that one may ask the person again until he agrees,\nwhereas normally if a person refuses to consent to something you must\nleave them alone. \n5. Reasonable Consensus Conceptions of Legitimate Political Authority\n\n\nReasonable consensus views of political authority attempt to find a\nkind of mean between the extreme individualism of consent theory and\nthe lack of respect for people's opinions of the instrumentalist views.\nJohn Rawls argues that the liberal principle of political legitimacy\nrequires that coercive institutions be so structured that they accord\nwith the reasonable views of the members of the society. As long as\nthey do so they have the right to impose duties on their members. The\nmembers may not demur on the basis of unreasonable views. Furthermore,\nit is not necessary on this view that the persons over whom authority\nis wielded have voluntarily acted or given any sign of agreement. All\nthat need be the case is that the basic principles that regulate the\ncoercive institutions be ones that the reasonable members can agree to\n(Rawls 1996).\n\n\nThis view seems to be a kind of middle position between consent\ntheory and the instrumentalist views. It does not allow individuals to\ndivest themselves of obligations on spurious or merely self-interested\nbases because it specifies what is and is not a reasonable basis for\nagreement to the basic principles of the society. At the same time it\nevinces a respect for the opinions of the members of society since it\nrequires that the basic principles that regulate the society accord\nwith the reasonable views of the members.\n\n\nThis account of legitimacy is based on an adherence to a principle of\nreasonableness. The basic principle asserts that reasonable persons\nwill propose fair terms of cooperation with other reasonable persons\nonly on condition that the terms can be justified to those others on\nthe basis of premises that they can reasonably accept. There has been\nmuch discussion of this principle and its underpinnings but this entry\nwill focus on a central worry concerning this idea.\n5.1 Problems of Reasonableness and Consensus\n\n\nA number of criticisms have been made against this kind of view.\nMany have argued that the relevant notion of reasonableness is likely\nto be very difficult to specify in a way that is both plausible and\ncompatible with possible consensus. The key difficulty with reasonable\nconsensus theories is that they rely on the possibility of consensus on\nat least a sufficient number of basic norms to say that there is\nconsensus on the basic principles that regulate a society. So if one\nattempts to come up with a notion of reasonableness that is\nsufficiently robust to generate agreement of this sort, then one is\nlikely to have a notion that is quite controversial. And then the view\ndoes not seem to take a sufficiently respectful view of the opinions of\nthe members of society since so many are likely to disagree with the\nconception of the reasonable. On the other hand, if one elaborates a\nconception of the reasonable that is sufficiently weak for most persons\nin the society to satisfy it, then one is not likely to generate\nagreement on the basic principles of the society.\n\n\nThe main worry is that the idea demands a level of consensus among\nmembers of society that is incompatible with the ordinary conditions of\npolitical societies (Christiano 1996; Waldron 1999). The principle\ndemands that there be a kind of consensus among citizens on the basic\nprinciples that underpin the operation of political society.\n\n\nThis consensus seems to be unattainable under the conditions of\nmodern society. One way, however, in which Rawls has argued in favor of\nthe attainability of the consensus is to say that it need only be an\noverlapping consensus. The idea here is that citizens do not have to\nagree on everything but only on those principles that apply to the\nbasic structure of society. And even here, when citizens disagree on\nsome issue of social justice, the opposing views are taken off the\ntable. So citizens can disagree on what the nature of the good life is\nand on religious questions and even different issues relating to social\njustice. As long as there are certain principles that everyone agrees\nto, which apply to the basic structure of society, full consensus is\nnot necessary. Hence, the consensus need only be an overlapping\none.\n\n\nThough this idea goes some way towards alleviating the worry that\ntoo much consensus is required by Rawls's theory, it does not go nearly\nfar enough. There is one main way in which the overlapping consensus\nfails to provide the kind of consensus that Rawls requires. If a group\nof citizens agrees on a set of principles for regulating society and\nsome of the citizens also think that some other principles apply, the\noverlapping consensus idea is that the citizens who hold the\nidiosyncratic views must take those particular demands off the table\nand must argue only on the basis of the shared principles. The idea is\nthat everyone appeals only to those principles that lie in the overlap\nand not to those that do not lie in the overlap. A legitimate exercise\nof political power is one that is grounded only in those principles\nthat lie in the overlap. This seems to diminish the amount of agreement\nnecessary to make a society legitimate.\n\n\nBut this appearance is an illusion. To see this we need only think\nof those people who hold idiosyncratic views. If the society they live\nin is exclusively grounded in principles that lie in the overlap of\nprinciples, then these people will have reason to complain that the\nsociety is unjust to the extent that the idiosyncratic principles are\nignored. For instance, if someone holds the idiosyncratic view that\npeople ought to receive in accordance with their desert then a society\nthat does not act to make sure that this principle is respected is one\nthat will be considered unjust by that person. They will live in a\nsociety that is unacceptable to them in a certain important respect\nrelevant to justice.\n\n\nOf course, if the desert principle is used to ground the basic\ninstitutions of society even though it does not lie in the overlap then\nthose who think that desert is not a proper principle of justice will\nlikely think that they are living in a society that they regard as\nunjust. The principle of legitimacy will imply in this context that the\nbasic institutions of society are illegitimate because they are not\nbased on principles everyone accepts. But surely the same can be said\nof those who hold the idiosyncratic principles. They can complain that\nthey are required to go along with institutions that are unjust by\ntheir lights. The imposition on them implied by the basic institutions\nthat fail to distribute in accordance with desert is as great as would\nbe the imposition on the others implied by institutions that do\ndistribute goods in accordance with desert. There is a complete\nsymmetry here. Indeed, one way to put this point is to say that those\nwho hold that desert is not a genuine principle of justice are\nthemselves holding an idiosyncratic view when we take into account the\nfact that many think that desert is a genuine principle of justice.\n\n\nAs a consequence of these considerations, only a complete consensus\nof political principles will satisfy the principle of legitimacy that\nRawls defends. But complete consensus on political principles is\nimpossible to achieve given the conditions of ordinary political\nsocieties. And so to the extent that this principle of legitimacy is\nunsatisfiable in ordinary political societies, it appears to be an\nunacceptably utopian principle. In particular, it seems to be an\nunacceptable principle of political legitimacy because a principle of\npolitical legitimacy is partly framed for the purpose of according\nmoral credentials to a society in the circumstances of political\ndisagreement.\n6. Political Authority as Grounded in Associative Obligations\n\n\nOne classical account of political authority has modeled political\nauthority and the attendant obligations on the obligations of family\nand the authority of the parents. Plato gives this account of authority\nand obligation among others in the Crito (Plato 1948). A recent attempt\nto ground the legitimacy of political authority in this way is Ronald\nDworkin's (Dworkin 1986). This view is meant to capture the idea that a\npolitical society can have legitimate authority even if it is not a\nvoluntary association and even if there is disagreement on many\npolitical principles.\n\n\nIf we take the family as a model here, we can see that children\nacquire obligations to obey their parents and to love and support their\nparents and siblings without having voluntarily entered into the\nrelationships. And there may be some relation of authority between\nparents and children at least till the latter reach the age of\nmaturity. Another model Dworkin invokes is that of friendship. He\nargues that though friendship does have an important voluntary\ncomponent, it is not the case that people voluntarily agree to the\nterms of a friendship. They find themselves acquiring obligations of\nfriendship as the friendship grows. Of course there is little in the\nway of authority in friendship and even in the family there is little\nauthority once the children reach maturity.\n\n\nThe analogy between obligations of family, friendship and political\nsociety is grounded in the idea that in all three of these, individuals\nare obligated to abide by the rules or norms of the community. Dworkin\nargues that legitimate political authority arises as a consequence of\nthe acquisition on the part of members of a political society of\nobligations to obey the rules of a genuine associative community. This\ngives the putative authority justification for coercing the members\ninto obedience of the rules, which is the key element of authority on\nDworkin's account.\n\n\nDworkin attempts to discern the basis of obligation in friendships\nand families by the process of interpretation of these social\npractices. His thesis is that communities that satisfy four conditions\nfor being genuine communities thereby generate obligations to go along\nwith the terms of the association. The four conditions are: one, each\nmember of the community sees herself as having special obligations to\nthe other members; two, they see the obligations as owed to each of the\nothers personally; three, these obligations are understood to flow from\na concern for the well being of each of the members; and four, the\nobligations are understood as flowing from a plausible version of equal\nconcern for all the members. Any community that satisfies these four\nconditions is a genuine community and thereby generates obligations in\neach of the members to comply with the terms of the association.\n\n\nDworkin thinks that families and friendships satisfy these\nconstraints in many cases and that only when they satisfy them do they\ngenerate obligations. He also thinks that a certain kind of political\nsociety can satisfy these conditions, which he calls a community of\nprinciple, i.e., a community wherein each member sees himself or\nherself as bound by common principles to all the others.\n\n\nOne might worry that a political society cannot be expected to\ngenerate the kinds of emotional bonds people have towards one another\nin families or friendships (Simmons 2001). And one might think that in\nthe absence of such bonds, the four conditions will not be satisfied.\nDworkin denies this. He agrees that political societies do not generate\nthese kinds of emotional bonds, but he asserts that emotional bonds are\nnot necessary either causally or conceptually to the satisfaction of\nthe four conditions.\n\n\nDworkin argues that the attribution of the four conditions to a\nrelationship occurs through an interpretation of that relationship so\nit need not be the case that each person is aware of satisfying any of\nthe four conditions when they do. Consider a person who appeals to his\nfellow citizens on the basis of a principle of freedom of speech on the\ngrounds that it is part of their constitution. This person is committed\nto legal principles that he shares with other citizens. He will be\ncommitted to the principles underlying the other elements of the\nconstitution and the legal history of his country. He will be committed\nto a principle of equality to the extent that it is part of the\nconstitution. We can interpret this person's behavior and the similar\nbehavior of others as committed to special obligations to their fellow\ncountrymen to the extent that it is the shared constitution they are\nappealing to. We can interpret this person as expressing a kind of\nequal concern for his fellow countrymen to the extent that he is\nappealing to legal principles that protect all. And we can interpret\nhim in this way even if he himself would not have asserted it. And to\nthe extent that people conform to this kind of practice more generally,\nwe can interpret their behavior generally as satisfying the four\nconditions of associative obligation.\n\n\nThe community of principle satisfies the four conditions. Dworkin\nattempts to show how a political community can generate special\nobligations of citizens to each other. A community of principle is\nregulated by principles that have been elaborated in a distinctive way\nin the particular community. Citizens see themselves as obligated to\nabide by those principles only in relation to the others who have\nparticipated in elaborating them. The principles do require that\neveryone be included and that everyone's well being counts and counts\nequally.\n\n\nThe idea of a community of principle is meant to accommodate\nsignificant disagreement in the society in two ways. First, people may\nnot think that the principles in the society are the best ones. They\nmay simply be the best interpretation of their shared legal culture and\nhistory. So people may try to advance their own conceptions of the best\nprinciples. Second, people will disagree about the best interpretations\nof the shared legal culture and thus may think that the society is\ngrounded in different principles.\n6.1 Do Communities of Principle Satisfy the Four Conditions of Genuine Association?\n\n\nBut surely, the satisfaction of some of the conditions must depend\non exactly what principles are in the community. Principles that are\nfocused on liberty and that avoid any reference to well being, such as\nKant would require of political principles, presumably would not\nsatisfy the last two conditions. Principles that are not egalitarian,\nsuch as those that governed the United States during the first century\nof its existence and probably longer, would not satisfy the last\ncondition. So it is not clear that being a community of principle is a\nsufficient condition for satisfying the four conditions.\n\n\nIt is also not obvious that it is necessary that a community be a\ncommunity of principle in order for it to satisfy the four conditions\nin Dworkin's sense. For one can imagine a community in which\nindividuals are committed to democratic resolution of the disagreements\non justice that arise and thereby are committed to the equal importance\nof the well being of each member. They attempt to advance opposing\nprinciples of justice and conceptions of the common good and make\ncompromises when they cannot secure sufficient majorities for these.\nIndeed, this seems much closer to the character of modern democracies\nthan Dworkin's view. Such a society would satisfy the four conditions\nbut it is not clear that it is a community of principle.\n\n\nDworkin's idea that modern political societies can be seen as\ncommunities of principle is grounded in his emphasis on judicial\ninstitutions as the core institutions of modern political societies and\nhis account of legal interpretation. His view is that judges interpret\nthe law by creating a coherent account of as much of the black letter\nlaw as possible and by interpreting that black letter law in terms of\nprinciples that make the law be the best that it can be. Hence, judges\naim at producing a coherent account of the law overall by grounding it\nin the best basic moral principles that it can be grounded in. From\nthis he thinks of modern societies as being concerned to elaborate\ncommon principles by which the society can be guided.\n\n\nBut his emphasis on judicial decision making seems excessive. In the\ndemocratic legislative process, citizens often do not see themselves as\nbeing guided by common principles. They see themselves as disagreeing\nwith each other about what principles the society ought to be guided\nby. They also often see themselves as disagreeing with and trying to\nchange the principles they see embodied in the law. They may look at\nthe legislation in their community as negotiated compromises between\ndifferent principles and not as deriving from a common set of\nprinciples. And yet they do see themselves as members of a common\ndemocratic community. This aspect of democratic rivalry does not seem\nto be very well accommodated by Dworkin's view of modern societies as\ncommunities of principle.\n7. A Democratic Conception of Legitimate Political Authority\n\n\nThe basic idea behind the democratic conception of legitimate\nauthority is that when there are disagreements among persons about how\nto structure their shared world together and it is important to\nstructure that world together, the way to choose the shared aspects of\nsociety is by means of a decision making process that is fair to the\ninterests and opinions of each of the members. When there is\ndisagreement about how to organize the shared system of law, property,\npublic education and the provision of public goods, no one can have his\nway entirely in this context without someone else not getting her way.\nEach person thinks that the ideas about justice and the common good\nwith which the others wish to organize their shared world are mistaken\nin some way. Yet there is a need for collective action. The only way to\ndo this that is reasonably fair to all the members is to make the\ndecision democratically.\n\n\nThe thought is that when an outcome is democratically chosen and\nsome people disagree with the outcome, as some inevitably will, they\nstill have a duty to go along with the decision because otherwise they\nwould be treating the others unfairly. If they refuse to go along and\ndisrupt the democratically chosen arrangements, they are assuming for\nthemselves a right to determine how things should go that overrides the\nequal rights of all the others. They are, in Peter Singer's words,\nassuming the positions of dictators in relation to the others. For if\nthey turned out to be in the majority, they would demand the compliance\nof the others.\n\n\nThe idea of fairness that underpins the democratic process is\ngrounded in different ways in different theories. The basic idea of\nequality is shared by most democratic theorists. Some argue that there\nis a fundamental duty of equal respect for the opinions of others that\ngrounds democratic decision making in the context of pervasive\ndisagreement (Singer 1974; Waldron 1999). Others wish to ground this\nduty of respect for the opinions of others in a deeper principle of\nequal concern for the interests of each member of society (Christiano\n1996).\n\n\nOn this kind of view the democratic assembly has a right to rule and\nto the obedience of its members. This right of the democratic assembly\nis grounded in the right of each member of the assembly to be accorded\nequal respect. The duty of equal respect requires that the collective\ndecision process gives each a vote in a broadly majoritarian process\nand a robustly equal opportunity to participate in the deliberations\nand negotiations leading to decisions. The equal rights of each of the\nmembers are in effect pooled in the democratic assembly so that because\none owes each person equal respect, and the democratic way of making\ndecisions embodies this equal respect, one owes the democratic assembly\nrespect.\n\n\nThe democratic assembly can be understood as the assembly of all\nadult citizens or better as the assembly of all the democratically\nchosen representatives of citizens. A conception of a democratic\nassembly requires, on this view, an account of the appropriate form of\ndemocratic representation (Christiano 1996). In addition, the\ndemocratic assembly is only one part of the complete system of\ngovernment. It is concerned with legislation only. In addition to this\na government requires executive and judicial functions whose legitimacy\nmay depend in part on other factors better grasped by the\ninstrumentalist view.\n\n\nThe duties that are owed the democratic assembly are content\nindependent and preemptive duties. They are content independent duties\nbecause each member has the duty, with a class of exceptions we will\nreview in a moment, just because the assembly has made a decision. The\nduties are preemptive because the citizen must put aside the\nconsiderations she initially planned on acting on in order to treat the\nrest of her fellow citizens with proper respect. The idea of equal\nrespect requires, on this account, deference to the decision of the\nmajority and not acting on one's own judgment when the majority\ndisagrees. So the decision of the majority gives a reason to obey that\npreempts or replaces the considerations one might act on were there no\nmajority decision.\n\n\nIt is important to note that this conception of authority is what was\ndescribed as a special conception above. The fact that democratic\nassemblies have authority does not imply that all other forms of\nregime never have authority. One might go along with a regime on the\nbasis of the instrumentalist conception of authority or even the\nconsent approach even if it is not democratic. It is clear\nnevertheless that democratic assemblies have a special kind of\nauthority.\n7.1 How Can Democracy Make Unjust Laws Legitimate?\n\n\nDemocratic decision making on this account can be evaluated from two\nvery different angles. On the one hand, one can evaluate a democratic\ndecision in terms of the justice or efficiency of the outcome of the\ndecision. One can ask whether the legislation is just or for the common\ngood. This is the standpoint of the citizen who argues in favor of\nlegislation and against others and tries to put together a coalition of\nlike minded people to advance the legislation. On the other hand,\ndemocratic decision making can be evaluated in terms of the way in\nwhich the decision was made. Did the process of decision making treat\nall of its members fairly or with equal respect? Are the institutions\nof legislative representation and of campaign finance, among others,\nfair?\n\n\nBut why should the equality embodied in the democratic assembly trump\nother considerations of justice? The democratic conception of\nauthority requires each person to submit issues to a democratic vote.\nSo if they advocate some policy on the grounds that it conforms with\nwhat they take to be the correct principle of justice J, and\nthe majority chooses a different policy on the grounds of an\nincompatible principle L, the democratic theory says that\nthey ought to accept the policy that is grounded in L because\nonly in this way do they accord the proper equal respect to their\nfellow citizens.\n\n\nBut someone might ask, why should the principle of equal respect take\nprecedence over the principle J? They are both principles of\njustice so we need some reason for favoring the equal respect\nprinciple in general over the others.\n\n\nOne answer to this is to say that social justice demands that\nprinciples of justice be public in the sense that they involve\nprinciples that can be shown to be implemented to everyone who is\nreasonably conscientious and aware of some basic facts of political\nlife (such as disagreement, fallibility and cognitive bias). This is a\nversion of the basic maxim of justice that justice must not only be\ndone, it must be seen to be done. The thought then is that to the\nextent that there is significant disagreement about the substantive\nprinciples of justice in play when policy is being decided, a just\nsociety requires some way in which publicly to embody the equal\ntreatment of all the individuals in society. The controversial\nprinciples guiding the formulation of policy do not generally satisfy\nthis constraint of publicity. Indeed, given the controversies over\njustice, individuals will think that the policies do not accord with\ntheir favored conception of equality. The democratic process does seem\npublicly to embody the equal standing of all citizens and the equal\nworth of their interests against the background of disagreement and\nfallibility and all the facts that attend these phenomena. So the\ndemocratic process seems uniquely capable of publicly embodying the\nprinciple of the equal importance of each person and the equal\nimportance of the advancement of their interests (Christiano 2004).\n\n\nCritics of this view might still take issue with the thesis that\nsocial justice requires that principles be public and that this gives\npriority to the principles that underpin democracy over those that\nunderpin substantive policy proposals. The question must be, why is\npublicity, in the sense sketched above, so important?\n7.2 Limits to Democratic Authority\n\n\nThe question that arises for a democratic theory of authority is,\nwhen do the considerations of the justice or injustice of the outcome\noverride the considerations connected with the fairness of the process\nof decision making?\n\n\nThe claim that a democratic assembly has a right to rule is not\nincompatible with the idea that there are limits to that right. Indeed,\ntheorists have argued that the very same principle that grounds\ndemocratic authority also ground limits to that authority (Christiano\n2004.) The principle of public equality on which the argument for\ndemocracy is founded also grounds a set of liberal rights (freedom of\nconscience, association, speech and private pursuits). The reason for\nthis is that democratic assembly that fundamentally denied these\nliberal rights to individuals would publicly violate the duty of equal\nrespect to those individuals. Those who violate the basic liberal\nrights of others are publicly treating them as inferiors. To the extent\nthat the democratic assembly's claim of authority is grounded in the\npublic realization of the principle of equal respect, the authority\nwould run out when the democratic assembly makes law that undermines\nequal respect. This establishes, at least for one conception of\ndemocratic authority, a substantive set of limits to that\nauthority.\n8. Legitimate Political Authority in International Institutions\n\n\nInternational Institutions have acquired political authority over the\nlast half century or so.  They are quite diverse in character.  For\nsome, their authority has a somewhat different form than the authority\nassociated with the organs of the state.  And the grounds of the\nauthority of international institutions may be distinct as\nwell. Overall, these are complex institutions with a number of parts\nand so different principles may apply to the different parts.  For\nexample, with regard to the World Trade Organization, some principle\nof state consent may be the ultimate basis of the legitimacy of its\nlaw making function, while a very different kind of standard would be\nrelevant to judging the legitimacy of the dispute settlement\nmechanism.\n\n\nBecause global institutions operate in the context of a lack of\noverarching and centralized political power, the form and grounds of\nauthority are likely often to be distinct.  As I noted above, some of\nthe most powerful global institutions have powers to create\npermissions rather than duties as in Security Council of the United\nNations authorizations of the use of force. Another example is when\nthe World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism rules that\na state may restrict trade with another state in what would normally\nbe a violation of their agreements in order to retaliate against a\nstate that has violated the trade agreements.\n\n\nAnother interesting feature of international institutions is that\nstate consent appears to be a possible basis for the legitimacy of\ninternational institutions.  To be sure many would argue that\ninternational institutions ought to be evaluated solely on an\ninstrumental basis and others would argue that only democratic\ninternational institutions can be legitimate.  But state consent does\nhave a fighting chance of playing a large role in underpinning these\ninstitutions.  The international system is highly decentralized and\nstates are by far the most important instruments for making power\naccountable to persons that we know of.\n\n\nTo be sure, the state consent doctrine raises many questions.  For one\nthing, we must ask whether the consent of states that do not represent\ntheir peoples is a genuinely legitimating act.  Second, we must ask\nabout the fairness of the conditions under which consent is given.  If\nthe conditions are unfair and more powerful states take advantage of\nthe vulnerabilities of the weaker state, what impact does this have on\nthe legitimacy of the state?  Third, what normative weight, if any,\nattaches to a state's refusal of consent when it's cooperation is\nnecessary to the achievement of morally mandatory aims such as the\nprevention or mitigation of global warming?",
