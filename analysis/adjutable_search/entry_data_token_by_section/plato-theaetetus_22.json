If\nO is not composite, O cannot be known, but only\n\u201cperceived\u201d (202b6).\n\n\nSocrates\u2019 main strategy in 202d8\u2013206c2 is to attack the Dream\u2019s claim\nthat complexes and elements are distinguishable in respect of\nknowability. To this end he deploys a dilemma. A complex, say a\nsyllable, is either (a) no more than its elements (its letters), or\n(b) something over and above those elements.\n\n\n202d8\u2013203e1 shows that unacceptable consequences follow from\nalternative (a), that a complex is no more than its elements. If I am\nto know a syllable SO, and that syllable is no more than its\nelements, then I cannot know the syllable SO without also\nknowing its elements S and O. Indeed, it seems that\ncoming to know the parts S and O is both necessary\nand sufficient for coming to know the syllable SO. But if\nthat is right, and if the letter/syllable relation models the\nelement/complex relation, then if any complex is knowable,\nits elements will be knowable too; and if any complex\u2019s elements\nare\nunknowable, then the complex will be unknowable too. This\nresult contradicts the Dream Theory.\n\n\n203e2\u2013205e8 shows that unacceptable consequences follow from\nalternative (b), that a complex is something over and above its\nelements. In that case, to know the syllable is to know something for\nwhich knowledge of the elements is not sufficient. The syllable turns\nout to be \u201ca single Idea that comes to be out of the\nfitted-together elements\u201d (204a1\u20132). But then the syllable does\nnot have the elements as parts: if it did, that would compromise its\nsingularity. And if the elements are not the parts of the syllable,\nnothing else can be. So the syllable has no parts, which makes it as\nsimple as an element. Thus if the element is unknowable, the syllable\nmust be unknowable too. This result contradicts the Dream Theory\ntoo.\n\n\nFinally, in 206a1\u2013c2, Plato makes a further, very simple, point\nagainst the Dream Theory. Our own experience of learning letters and\nsyllables shows that it is both more basic and more important to know\nelements than complexes, not vice versa as the Dream Theory\nimplies. The thesis that the complexes are knowable, the elements\nunknowable, is false to our experience, in which \u201cknowledge of\nthe elements is primary\u201d (Burnyeat 1990:192).\n",
