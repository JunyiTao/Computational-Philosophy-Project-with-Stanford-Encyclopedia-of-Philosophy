Deontology and Uncertainty About Outcomes\n\nRecently, deontologists have begun to ask how an actor should evaluate\ncourses of action in which it is uncertain whether a deontological\nconstraint will be violated. For example, should one detonate dynamite\nin a mining operation if there is a chance that the explosion will\ncause the Fat Man to tumble into the path of the trolley that would\notherwise kill five? (Assume that were the chance the same that the\nexplosion would instead divert the trolley in Trolley, killing one but\nsaving five, the detonation would be permissible.) Or should one take\na drive to observe the scenery if there is a slightly increased chance\nthat, because of the possibility of traffic, doing so will cause one\nto miss a lunch one had promised to attend? Whether deontological\nconstraints focus on agents\u2019 intentions or beliefs, or whether they\nfocus on agents\u2019 counting positively in their deliberations others\u2019\nuse as means, how should the uncertainty of outcomes be taken into\naccount by deontologists? This question has been addressed by Aboodi,\nBorer, and Enoch (2008); Alexander (2016; 2018); Lazar (2015; 2017a,\n2017b, 2018); Smith (2014); Tarsney (2018); and Tomlin (2019).\n",
