    "main_text": "The Emergence of Ecological Rationality || Behavioral Constraints and Environmental Structure\n3.1 Behavioral Constraints and Environmental Structure\n\nSimon thought that both behavioral constraints and environmental\nstructure ought to figure in a theory of bounded rationality, yet he\ncautioned against identifying behavioral and environmental properties\nwith features of an organism and features of its physical environment,\nrespectively:\n\n\nwe must be prepared to accept the possibility that what we call\n\u201cthe environment\u201d may lie, in part, within the skin of the\nbiological organisms. That is, some of the constraints that must be\ntaken as givens in an optimization problem may be physiological and\npsychological limitations of the organism (biologically defined)\nitself. For example, the maximum speed at which an organism can move\nestablishes a boundary on the set of its available behavior\nalternatives. Similarly, limits on computational capacity may be\nimportant constraints entering into the definition of rational choice\nunder particular circumstances. (Simon 1955a: 101)\n\n\nThat said, what is classified as a behavioral constraint rather than\nan environmental affordance varies across disciplines and the\ntheoretical tools pressed into service. For example, one computational\napproach to bounded rationality, computational rationality\ntheory (Lewis et al. 2014), classifies the cost to an organism of\nexecuting an optimal program as a behavioral constraint, classifies\nlimits on memory as an environmental constraint, and treats the costs\nassociated with searching for an optimal program to execute as\nexogenous. Anderson and Schooler\u2019s study and computational\nmodeling of human memory (Anderson & Schooler 1991) within the\nACT-R framework, on the other hand, views the limits on memory and\nsearch-costs as behavioral constraints which are adaptive responses to\nthe structure of the environment. Still another broad class of\ncomputational approaches are found in statistical signal\nprocessing, such as adaptive filters (Haykin 2013), which are\ncommonplace in engineering and vision (Marr 1982; Ballard & Brown\n1982). Signal processing methods typically presume the sharp\ndistinction between device and world that Simon cautioned against,\nhowever. Still others have challenged the distinction between\nbehavioral constraints and environmental structure by arguing that\nthere is no clear way to separate organisms from the environments they\ninhabit (Gibson 1979), or by arguing that features of cognition which\nappear body-bound may not be necessarily so (Clark & Chalmers\n1998).\n\nBearing in mind the different ways the distinction between behavior\nand environment have been drawn, and challenges to what precisely\nfollows from drawing such a distinction, ecological approaches to\nrationality all endorse the thesis that the ways in which an organism\nmanages structural features of its environment are essential to\nunderstanding how deliberation occurs and effective behavior arises.\nIn doing so theories of bounded rationality have traditionally focused\non at least some of the following features, under this rough\nclassification:\n\n\n\nBehavioral Constraints\u2014may refer to bounds on\ncomputation, such as the cost of searching the best algorithm\nto run, an appropriate rule to apply, or a satisficing option to\nchoose; the cost of executing an optimal algorithm,\nappropriate rule, or satisficing choice; and costs of storing\nthe data structure of an algorithm, the constitutive elements of a\nrule, or the objects of a decision problem.\n\n\nEcological Structure\u2014may refer to\nstatistical, topological, or other perceptible\ninvariances of the task environment that an organism is adapted\nto; or to architectural features or biological\nfeatures of the computational processes or cognitive mechanisms\nresponsible for effective behavior, respectively.\n\n",
