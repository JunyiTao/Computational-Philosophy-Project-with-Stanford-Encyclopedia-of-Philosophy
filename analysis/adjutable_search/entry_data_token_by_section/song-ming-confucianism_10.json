    "main_text": "Pattern (li) || Pattern and Heartmind\n3.3 Pattern and Heartmind\n\nXin \u201cheartmind\u201d is the locus of both thoughts and\nemotions as well as the faculty responsible for directing them\nproperly. Confucians in the Song-Ming period took a great deal of\nphilosophical interest in the nature, characteristics, and function of\nthe heartmind, explications of which could help to identify and\nspecify features of moral and epistemic virtues. One of the most\ncontentious issues, however, had to do with the relation between\nheartmind and Pattern.\n\nIn broad brushstrokes, we could say that there are two clusters of\nphilosophical concerns at work in much Confucian discussion of the\nrelation between heartmind and Pattern in this era. First, many\nConfucians worried about developing systems of ethical norms too far\nremoved from our actual psychological dispositions. So, for example,\nthey criticized Mohists for their view that one should treat the\nwelfare of all people as having an equal claim on them, no matter\ntheir relationship to oneself (e.g., whether a parent or a stranger),\narguing that the ideal was so far removed from our natural tendencies\nas to be impossible (JSL 2.89, 13.2; CXL 93). Our\nethical norms, they suggested, should be ones that we have a certain\nnatural capacity to understand and embrace. A major reason for this is\nwhat has been called the \u201cwholeheartedness criterion\u201d for\nvirtue: if someone has fully instantiated a particular virtue, it must\nbe the case that the person embraces it completely and without any\nreluctance or countervailing desires (Tiwald 2018b: 179\u2013183).\nSomeone who cares for others grudgingly or with some reluctance cannot\nbe fully humane or benevolent (ren \u4ec1), for example.\nMany Confucians in the Song through Ming thought that the virtues\nworthy of our esteem were only those that we could potentially embrace\nin a wholehearted fashion, achieving a state sometimes called\n\u201csincerity\u201d (cheng \u8aa0) by the Cheng\nbrothers and those who followed them (JSL 1.3;\nHNCSYS 6:92). By making the possibility of wholeheartedness a\ncondition for esteeming something as a virtue, they tied their ethics\neven more closely to the heartmind that we happen to have. It is\ndifficult enough to adopt practices that go against the grain of our\nnatural dispositions. It is even more difficult to embrace them and\nenact them without reservation or regret.\n\nGiven the strong emphasis on wholeheartedness and the need to fully\nembrace the ethical norms that many Song-Ming Confucians promoted,\nsome saw advantages in views that closely identified heartmind with\nPattern. If a particular practice or character trait (e.g., filial\npiety) is correct by virtue of being a manifestation or expression of\nPattern, and that practice or character trait is to be one that we\ncould embrace wholeheartedly and naturally, we can explain how Pattern\nand our wholehearted potential converge by saying that Pattern shares\na common source with or is even constituted by our heartminds. Several\nConfucian philosophers made this idea explicit. The most famous\nadvocates for seeing heartmind as constitutive of Pattern are Lu\nXiangshan and Wang Yangming, both of whom are often characterized as\nbelonging to a special lineage or school of thought known as\n\u201cHeartmind Learning\u201d (Xinxue). Lu and Wang\nadopted this understanding of Pattern in part because they saw it as\nputting Confucian ethical norms within reach of people in their\nordinary lives, and criticized more scholarly or bookish methods of\ngrasping the Confucian Way, which they worried would never become\nsufficiently intuitive to embrace wholeheartedly or sincerely (Ivanhoe\n2009). Even more radical views were developed by the so-called Taizhou\nConfucians like Wang Gen, Luo Rufang, and Li Zhi, who thought that the\nConfucian way should be so accessible to ordinary heartminds as to be\nintuitive even to people with little education or formal Confucian\ntraining (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 86\u201387, 106\u2013108). \n\nBut there was a second set of concerns that tended to push against the\ntemptation to say that heartmind is a constituent of Pattern. This had\nto do with the pernicious implications of subjectivist accounts of\nethical norms. By the start of the Song, many of China\u2019s\nlaypeople adopted practices from Chan Buddhism (better known in the\nWest as Zen Buddhism) and much of the intelligentsia were interested\nin Chan ideas. Chinese Buddhists in general took an interest in the\nways that features of the seemingly objective world were actually\ndependent on (and constituted by) the minds or heartminds of subjects\n(DSQXL 575c-579c). And some Chan Buddhists openly embraced a\nway of life that seemed to countenance subjective whims or\ninclinations (Gregory 2002). This, at least, was a worry about\nBuddhism shared by Confucians in the Song-Ming period. Cheng Yi\nsuccinctly described the difference between Buddhist and Confucian\nethics by suggesting that the former \u201cbased themselves on the\nheartmind\u201d whereas Confucians \u201cbased themselves on\nHeaven\u201d (Tian, the cosmos, the objective order)\n(HNCSYS 21b:274). Accordingly, it become something of a\ncommonplace for some Confucians to accuse others of being too\nBuddhist, by which they often meant that the latter (more Buddhist)\nConfucians failed to establish standards of assessment sufficiently\nindependent of subjective whim (Angle & Tiwald 2017: 72\u201388).\nThis is a complaint that Zhu Xi often made about his contemporary Lu\nXiangshan (ZZYL 104:2619\u201320, 124:2975\u201376; Zhu\n2019: 148\u2013150). Zhu preferred ways of characterizing the\nrelation between heartmind and Pattern according to which the latter\nwas largely independent of the former, and was careful to distinguish\nbetween phases or states of heartmind that appropriately tracked and\nreflected Pattern (called \u201cthe heartmind of the Way\u201d,\nDaoxin \u9053\u5fc3) and phases or states in which the\nheartmind imposed its own selfish or private desires and inclinations\n(called \u201cthe human heartmind\u201d, renxin\n\u4eba\u5fc3). In making this distinction he followed Cheng Yi and\ntook himself to be in direct opposition to Lu Xiangshan (Angle &\nTiwald 2017: 83\u201386).\n",
