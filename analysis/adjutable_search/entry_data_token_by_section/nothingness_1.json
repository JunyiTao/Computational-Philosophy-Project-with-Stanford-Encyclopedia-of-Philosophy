Is there at most one empty world?\n\nMost philosophers would grant Peter van Inwagen\u2019s premise that\nthere is no more than one empty world. They have been trained to model\nthe empty world on the empty set. There can be no more than one empty\nset because distinct sets require a difference in their members.\n\nHowever, medieval philosophers differentiated empty worlds by the\npower of places within those worlds (Grant 1981). The Condemnation of\n1277 forced Aristotelian philosophers to acknowledge the possibility\nof a void (to respect God\u2019s omnipotence and the Christian\ndoctrine of creation from nothing). Most thinkers retained\nAristotle\u2019s assumption that there was a unique center of the\nuniverse. If rocks were introduced into such a world, they would all\nhead toward their natural location at the center of the universe.\n(Aristotle used this point to provide a spectacular explanation of why\nthere are not two earths; they would have collided!) However, Nicole\nOresme imagined a world without any center. He predicted the rocks\nwould head toward each other. Since air, fire, earth, and water each\nhad their own places in Aristotle\u2019s physics, fourteenth century\nphilosophers could imagine worlds that differed as to which of these\nplaces to retain. The void was rarely pictured as homogeneous.\n\nAristotle\u2019s world is self-governed. Objects have powers that\ncollectively explain the order of the universe. Thinkers in the\nAbrahamic tradition replaced Aristotle\u2019s invisible hand\nexplanation with God\u2019s hidden hand. God dictated laws of nature\nto which He made periodic adjustments (like clockmakers who regularly\nserviced their creations, correcting the accumulating errors). Focus\non God\u2019s perfection made attributions of divine intervention\nresemble left-handed compliments to God\u2019s Intelligence. After\nthe attributions of miracles were retracted, God Himself was retired.\nWhat was left were relic \u201claws of nature\u201d. Since a\nNecessary Being no longer guided the legislation, the actual world\nemerged as highly contingent. At first blush, this vindicates van\nInwagen\u2019s probabilistic argument. But the contingency of laws\nalso raises the possibility of individuating empty worlds by their\nlaws (Carroll 1994, 64). For instance, Isaac Newton\u2019s first law\nof motion says an undisturbed object will continue in motion in a\nstraight line. Some previous physicists suggested that such an object\nwill slow down and tend to travel in a circle. This empty world\ndiffers from the Newtonian empty world because different\ncounterfactual statements are true of it.\n\nIf variation in empty worlds can be sustained by differences in the\nlaws that apply to them, there will be infinitely many empty worlds.\nThe gravitational constant of an empty world can equal any real number\nbetween 0 and 1, so there are more than countably many empty worlds.\nIndeed, any order of infinity achieved by the set of populated\npossible worlds will be matched by the set of empty worlds.\n\nJohn Heil (2013) is bemused by this War of the Possible Worlds. Having\ndispensed with the Law Maker, we should repudiate the Laws of Nature.\nOnce we return to a self-governed world, there will be no worry about\nthe world as a lucky accident. As Immanuel Kant emphasized in his\nexplanation of why science cannot establish necessary truths, we do\nnot literally see actual states of affairs as being contingent rather\nthan necessary. Contingency, unlike color or shape, is not\nperceptible. Nor is there any presumption for regarding states of\naffairs as contingent.\n\nSubjective chance does not suffice for objective chance. To\ndemonstrate the impossibility of long-term prediction, Daniel\nKahneman, Oliver Sibony and Cass Sunstein invite the reader to\n\u201cconsider the fact that at the instant of conception, there was\nan even chance that every significant figure in history (and also the\ninsignificant onces) would be born with a different gender\u201d.\n(2021, 141) Those who believe in the necessity of origins will\ndisagree. According to Saul Kripke (1990, 112\u2013113), Socrates\ncould not have originated from a sperm-egg combination other than the\none from which he actually originated. Since the Y chromosome of his\nfather dictated Socrates\u2019 biological gender, Socrates is as\nessentially male as he is essentially human. When we imagine\nSophroniscus siring a daughter with Phaenarete in 469 BC, we are\nimagining Socrates failing to exist. Kripke\u2019s metaphysics also\nprecludes the consolation Richard Dawkins offers in Unweaving the\nRainbow: \u201cWe are going to die, and that makes us the lucky\nones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going\nto be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place\noutnumber the sand grains of Arabia.\u201d (1998, 1). From\nKripke\u2019s perspective, the number of non-existent people is zero.\nWhen we speak of those who are never conceived, we are imagining a\npossible world with a population originating from alternative\nsperm-egg combinations. They would have existed but do not exist. \n\nNotoriously, the modal realist David Lewis (1986) contends that people\nin other possible worlds exist just as much as actual people. These\npeople have no more reason to envy us than we have for envying them.\nRelative to the world of these potential people, we are the\nnon-actual people. \u2018Actual\u2019 is an indexical term on a par\nwith \u2018here\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019. I can pity my freezing\nfriends in Canada for not being here now in the mild winter of Austin,\nTexas. But that is because the Canadians could travel to Austin. There\nis no travel between possible worlds. According to Lewis, no object\nexists in more than one possible world. When you imagine yourself not\nexisting, you are thinking about a possible world that resembles the\nactual world except there is no counterpart of you. Your\nexistence in the actual world is not a matter of luck. The feeling\nthat you've won the lottery for existence arises from the striking\nresemblance between the actual world and a possible world in which\nsome other child is conceived by counterparts of your parents.\n\nSurprise that something exists is just as metaphysically laden as\nsurprise that you exist. According to Heil, \u2018Why is there\nsomething rather than nothing?\u2019 owes its urgency to a partisan\nbackground theory, not a neutral arbiter such as perception or\nmethodology.\n\nAlthough possible worlds became popular among analytic philosophers\nafter revolutionary advances in modal logic in the 1960s, possible\nworlds receive little attention from existentialists. Their discussion\nof objects is more in line with powers ontology advocated by Heil.\nIndeed, some existentialists picture nothingness as a kind of force\nthat impedes each object\u2019s existence. Since there is something\nrather than nothing, any such nihilating force cannot have actually\ngone unchecked. What could have blocked it? Robert Nozick (1981, 123)\ntoys with an interpretation of Heidegger in which this nihilating\nforce is self-destructive. This kind of double-negation is depicted in\nthe Beatles\u2019s movie Yellow Submarine. There is a\ncreature that zooms around like a vacuum cleaner, emptying everything\nin its path. When this menace finally turns on itself, a richly\npopulated world pops into existence.\n\nSome cultures have creation myths reminiscent of Yellow\nSubmarine. Heidegger would dismiss them as inappropriately\nhistorical. \u2018Why is there something rather than nothing?\u2019\nis not about the origin of the world. Increasing the scientific\nrespectability of the creation story (as with the Big Bang hypothesis)\nwould still leave Heidegger objecting that the wrong question is being\naddressed.\n",
