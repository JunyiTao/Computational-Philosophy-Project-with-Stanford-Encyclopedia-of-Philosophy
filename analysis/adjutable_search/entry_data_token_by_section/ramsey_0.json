    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nRamsey was born in Cambridge on 22 February 1903. His father was a\nmathematician and Fellow of Magdalene College whilst his mother\ncampaigned for women\u2019s suffrage and other social causes. In 1920\nRamsey matriculated as an undergraduate student at Trinity College,\nCambridge, from which he graduated in 1923 with a First in\nMathematics. The year before he matriculated, whilst still a 17 year\nold school boy, Ramsey became friends, through his father\u2019s\nconnections, with C.K. Ogden and I.A. Richards, also a Fellow of\nMagdalene. Ramsey had already read Russell\u2019s Introduction to\nMathematical Philosophy and G.E. Moore\u2019s Ethics\nbut because he had become interested in learning German, Ogden gave\nRamsey Mach\u2019s Die Analyse der Empfindungen\n[Analysis of Sensations] to read. Ramsey, still in his final\nschool year, went on to read Louis Couturat, Henri Poincar\u00e9 and\nHermann Weyl. By 1921, Ogden had become so impressed by Ramsey\u2019s\nphilosophical acumen and facility with German that he commissioned\nRamsey, as a second year undergraduate, to translate\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus into English \u2013 in the\nface of Moore\u2019s scepticism that the Tractatus could be\ntranslated into English at all. Back in 1920, Ramsey also discussed\nwith Ogden and Richards their theory of thought and language, later\nfamously elaborated in The Meaning of Meaning (1923), which\nRamsey reviewed \u2013 unfavourably \u2013 in Mind (1924).\nRamsey nonetheless praised \u201cthe excellent appendix on C.S.\nPeirce\u201d and this lead him to study the volume of Peirce\u2019s\npapers, Chance, Love and Logic (1923), which Ogden had just\npublished in his book series for Kegan Paul. During Ramsey\u2019s\nfirst year as an undergraduate, Ogden also arranged for him to meet\nRussell in London and encouraged Ramsey to attend Moore\u2019s\nlectures with him and Richards; Ramsey duly went along in his second\nterm to Moore\u2019s lectures on \u201cIncomplete Symbols and\nLogical Constructions\u201d. Moore was later to recall \u201cIn the\nearly twenties F.P. Ramsey attended at least one course of my\nlectures. I had soon come to feel of him, as of Wittgenstein, that he\nwas much cleverer than I was\u201d (1944, 35).\n\nIn his first year as an undergraduate, Ramsey had met and befriended\nR.B. Braithwaite, then a mathematics undergraduate a year ahead of\nhim. Braithwaite introduced Ramsey to J.M. Keynes, the economist.\nRamsey was soon after elected to the Cambridge Apostles, the secret\ndebating society of which Braithwaite and Keynes were both active\nmembers. Ramsey attended Keynes\u2019 economics lectures and they\ndiscussed Keynes\u2019 Treatise on Probability (1921).\nRamsey\u2019s criticisms appeared the following year in a review of\nKeynes\u2019 book for Ogden\u2019s journal, The Cambridge\nMagazine (1922); Keynes had maintained that probability is an\nobjective relation between propositions but Ramsey denied we perceive\nsuch relations nor grasp them intellectually. After his finals, Ramsey\nturned to writing a critical notice for Mind of\nWittgenstein\u2019s Tractatus (1923). Ogden had written to\nWittgenstein suggesting that he meet with Ramsey and Ramsey duly went\nto Puchberg, near Vienna, in September 1923 to spend a fortnight with\nWittgenstein working through the Tractatus with him. In 1924\nRamsey spent 6 months in Vienna being psychoanalysed, during which\ntime he met Moritz Schlick and Hans Hahn, both members of the Vienna\nCircle. He returned to Cambridge in October 1924 where he had been\nappointed as a Fellow In Mathematics at King\u2019s College, where\nKeynes, also a Fellow, had pushed for Ramsey\u2019s appointment. At a\nmeeting of the Moral Sciences Club that December, Ramsey met his\nfuture wife, Lettice Baker; they married in 1925 and had two daughters\ntogether.\n\nOnce back in Cambridge, Ramsey settled down to teach, including a\ncourse on the foundations of mathematics, and to write the papers in\nphilosophy, economics and mathematics for which he was to become\nfamous. He started by completing \u201cThe Foundations of\nMathematics\u201d, which he had begun in Vienna, and\n\u201cUniversals\u201d, both published in 1925. The former was\nintended to rescue logicism by remedying the defects Ramsey found in\nPrincipia Mathematica, whilst the latter was a development of\nthe programme of logical analysis advertised in the\nTractatus; they won Ramsey immediate \u00e9clat. But it was\nthe following year in which Ramsey really struck out on his own,\nwriting \u201cTruth and Probability\u201d (1926a) although he did\nnot publish it, which started from Ramsey\u2019s criticisms of Keynes\nand provides a subjective theory of probability and a pragmatic view\nof induction, and \u201cFacts and Propositions\u201d (1927a),\ninitially inspired by his reading of Peirce and Russell\u2019s\nAnalysis of Mind (1921), in which Ramsey\u2019s philosophy\nof mind and language began to have, as he put it, a distinctive\n\u2018pragmatist tendency\u2019 (1927a, 170). It was also the year\nthat Ramsey began dedicated work on economics which resulted in the\nfirst of his seminal papers on economics, \u2018A contribution to the\ntheory of taxation\u2019 (1927b), later followed by his\n\u2018Mathematical Theory of Saving\u2019 (1928a). Ramsey also wrote\nhis influential paper, \u2018On a Problem of Formal Logic\u2019\n(1930), which contains the mathematical results now called\n\u2018Ramsey\u2019s Theorems\u2019. In 1927 Ramsey also began work\non a book manuscript, On Truth ([OT]). During the last two\nyears of his life, Ramsey wrote a number of philosophical notes and\npapers, including \u2018Theories\u2019 and \u2018General\nPropositions and Causality\u2019, both completed in 1929. They were\npublished by Braithwaite (in [FM]), along with \u2018Truth and\nProbability\u2019, in a posthumous volume of Ramsey\u2019s papers,\nThe Foundations of Mathematics and other Logical Essays,\nwhilst the manuscript on truth did not appear until 1991.\n\nAfter meeting and falling out with Ramsey when visiting Keynes in\n1925, Wittgenstein returned to settle in Cambridge in 1929. He was\nadmitted as a Ph.D. student, submitting the Tractatus as his\nthesis, Ramsey was his supervisor; they met regularly during what was\nto be the last year of Ramsey\u2019s life. Wittgenstein was later to\nrecall the significance of these conversations for his own\nintellectual development in the preface to Philosophical\nInvestigations. Ramsey fell ill at the end of November 1929 and\nwas diagnosed with jaundice. He had been corresponding with Schlick\nand had promised to write a review of Rudolf Carnap\u2019s\nAufbau. He died on 19 January 1930 in Guy\u2019s Hospital in\nLondon. His death was unexpected and its causes remain uncertain. In\nan obituary for the Cambridge Review, Braithwaite wrote,\n\u2018His intellectual subtlety was combined with the most delightful\nsimplicity and candour. Intolerant of fools, he inspired others by his\nmental fertility and integrity. To one at least of his friends his\ndeath is as if a lighthouse were extinguished and we were left to\ngrope our way in the dark\u2019 (1930, 216).\n\nMellor\u2019s BBC radio programme on Ramsey, produced in 1978 (see\nOther Internet Resources below), features the first hand testimony of\nBraithwaite, Lettice Ramsey, and I.A. Richards. See also Sahlin 1990,\n221\u20139, Mellor 1995 and Taylor 2006. Ramsey\u2019s sister,\nMargaret Paul, provides a more personal account of Ramsey\u2019s\nlife, drawing upon letters and diaries, in her memoir (2012). Misak\n(2020) provides an in-depth intellectual biography of Ramsey.\n",
