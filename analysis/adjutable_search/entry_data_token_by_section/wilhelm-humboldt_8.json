Some Essentials of Humboldt\u2019s Understanding of Language\n\nSubsequently, in his linguistics and philosophy of language Humboldt\nwould advance a similar generative view of human language and speech.\nBecause he understood linguistic form as procedural rule and\ndirection, as forma formans, (Form von Form, GS Vol\n5: 455) rather than as some kind of material shape or fixed objective\nentity (Form von Materie), the structure and organization of\na language for him could not be gathered from the actual verbal forms\nof its construction, its grammar. It was to be obtained rather from an\nanalysis of the procedures language employs in its generation of\nspeech (Verfahrensweise der Sprache bei der Erzeugung der\nRede). For, as Humboldt put it\n\n\n\u2026 language in actuality only exists in spoken discourse, its\ngrammar and dictionary are hardly even comparable to its dead skeleton\n(Die Sprache liegt nur in der verbundenen Rede, Grammatik und\nW\u00f6rterbuch sind kaum ihrem todten Gerippe vergleichbar, GS\nVol 6: 147)\n\n\nHow such an analysis of the process of speech production is to\nproceed, what it encompasses, what it is able to achieve and how it\nwill enable the linguist to study and describe different natural\nlanguages, Humboldt has discussed in great depth and detail in several\nof his larger linguistic treatises, as for example in his\nFundamentals of the Linguistic Prototype (Grundz\u00fcge\ndes allgemeinen Sprachtypus, GS Vol 5: 400ff.) \n\nTo understand his approach to linguistics and to appreciate the\nempirical linguistic investigations that will follow from it, it is\nnecessary to take a closer look at his conception of language at its\nformative stage where philosophy and linguistics intersect in a\ndistinct manner. During Humboldt\u2019s Jena period the problem of the\nrelationship between thinking, language and reality that seemed to\nhave been settled once and for all by rationalist (Descartes, Leibniz)\nand empiricist (Locke, Condillac) thinkers alike, became an open\nquestion again for Humboldt, who looked at it from the new perspective\nthat Kantian and Fichtean philosophy had opened up. In 1795 he wrote a\nseries of sixteen theses on On Thinking and Speaking\n(Ueber Denken und Sprechen, GS Vol 7: 581\u201383) in\nresponse to a recent essay by Fichte \u201cOn the origin of language\nand human language ability\u201d. In this, his first major statement\non language, he takes issue with the concept of the linguistic sign,\nwhich had been one of the cornerstones of seventeenth and\neighteenth-century philosophy of language. In both the rationalist and\nempiricist schools of thought it was assumed that signs constituted a\nspecial class of objects outside the mind existing independently from\nit to which convenient labels agreed upon by society had been\nattached. The relationship of these signs to the mental ideas they\nwere supposed to represent were therefore understood as\n\u201carbitrary\u201d or \u201cconventional\u201d. Although\nempiricists and rationalists agreed that speaking required the use of\nsigns and that without them mental operations whether they derived\nfrom sensations or not were not possible, they were unable to explain\nas Herder had put it, how \u201cthe sound of roundness was able to\nrepresent the idea of roundness\u201d. But Herder himself had not\nbeen able to advance a plausible solution to the problem, either, even\nthough he connected the origin of language with reflection\n(Besonnenheit), claiming that it was through reflection that\nhumans had first created language. \n",
