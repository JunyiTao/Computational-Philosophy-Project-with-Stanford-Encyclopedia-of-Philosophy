    "main_text": "Einstein || From Special Relativity to General Relativity\n2.3 From Special Relativity to General Relativity\n\nEinstein\u2019s STR was the first clear and empirically successful\nphysical theory to overtly eliminate the concepts of absolute rest and\nabsolute velocity while recovering most of the successes of\nclassical mechanics and 19th century electrodynamics. It therefore\ndeserves to be considered the first highly successful theory to\nexplicitly relativize motion, albeit only partially. But STR only\nrecovered most of the successes of classical physics: crucially, it\nleft out gravity. And there was certainly reason to be concerned that\nNewtonian gravity and STR would prove incompatible: classical gravity\nacted instantaneously at a distance, while STR eliminated the\nprivileged absolute simultaneity that this instantaneous action\npresupposes.\n\nSeveral ways of modifying Newtonian gravity to make it compatible with\nthe spacetime structure of STR suggested themselves to physicists in\nthe years 1905\u20131912, and a number of interesting\nLorentz-covariant theories were proposed (i.e., theories compatible\nwith the spacetime of STR, which is called \u2018Minkowski\nspacetime\u2019 because Hermann Minkowski first revealed the\nspacetime structure that Einstein\u2019s postulates in STR entail).\nEinstein rejected these proposed theories one and all, for violating\neither empirical facts or theoretical desiderata. But Einstein\u2019s\nchief reason for not pursuing the reconciliation of gravitation with\nSTR\u2019s spacetime appears to have been his desire, beginning in\n1907, to replace STR with a theory in which not only velocity could be\nconsidered merely relative, but also acceleration. That is to say,\nEinstein wanted if possible to completely eliminate all absolute\nquantities of motion from physics, thus realizing a theory that\nsatisfies at least one kind of \u2018strict\u2019 relationism.\n(Regarding Einstein\u2019s rejection of Lorentz-covariant gravity\ntheories, see Norton 1992; regarding Einstein\u2019s quest to fully\nrelativize motion, see Hoefer 1994.)\n\nEinstein began to see this complete relativization as possible in\n1907, thanks to his discovery of the Equivalence Principle (cf.\nLehmkuhl forthcoming). Imagine we are far out in space, in a\nrocket ship accelerating at a constant rate \\(g = 9.81 m/s^2.\\) Things\nwill feel just like they do on the surface of the Earth; we will feel\na clear up-down direction, bodies will fall to the floor when\nreleased, etc. Indeed, due to the well-known empirical fact that\ngravity affects all bodies by imparting a force proportional to their\nmatter (and energy) content, independent of their internal\nconstitution, we know that any experiment performed on this rocket\nwill give the same results that the same experiment would give if\nperformed on the Earth. Now, Newtonian theory teaches us to consider\nthe apparent downward, gravity-like forces in the rocket ship as\n\u2018pseudo-forces\u2019 or \u2018inertial forces\u2019, and\ninsists that they are to be explained by the fact that the ship is\naccelerating in absolute space. But Einstein asked whether there is\nany way for the person in the rocket to regard him/herself as being\n\u2018at rest\u2019 rather than in absolute (accelerated) motion?\nAnd the answer he gave is: Yes. The rocket traveler may regard\nhim/herself as being \u2018at rest\u2019 in a homogeneous and\nuniform gravitational field. Such a field would entail an accelerative\nforce \u201cdownward\u201d on every body that is equal in magnitude\nand direction everywhere in space. This is unlike the Earth\u2019s\ngravitational field, which varies depending on distance from the\nEarth\u2019s center and points in different directions at different\nlocations. Positing the existence of such a field will explain all the\nobservational facts just as well as the supposition that he/she is\naccelerating relative to absolute space (or, absolutely accelerating\nin Minkowski spacetime). But is it not clear that the latter is the\ntruth, while the former is a fiction? By no means; if there\nwere a uniform gravitational field filling all space, then it\nwould affect all the other bodies in the world \u2013 the Earth, the\nstars, etc, \u2013 imparting to them a downward acceleration away\nfrom the rocket; and that is exactly what the traveler observes.\n\nIn 1907 Einstein published his first gravitation theory (Einstein\n1907), treating the gravitational field as a scalar field that also\nrepresented the (now variable and frame-dependent) speed of light.\nEinstein viewed the theory as only a first step on the road to\neliminating absolute motion. In the 1907 theory, the theory\u2019s\nequations take the same form in any inertial or uniformly\naccelerating frame of reference. One might say that this theory\nreduces the class of absolute motions, leaving only rotation and other\nnon-uniform accelerations as absolute. But, Einstein reasoned, if\nuniform acceleration can be regarded as equivalent to being at rest in\na constant gravitational field, why should it not be possible also to\nregard inertial effects from these other, non-uniform motions as\nsimilarly equivalent to \u201cbeing at rest in a (variable)\ngravitational field\u201d? Thus Einstein set himself the goal of\nexpanding the principle of equivalence to embrace all forms of\n\u2018accelerated\u2019 motion.\n\nEinstein thought that the key to achieving this aim lay in further\nexpanding the range of reference frames in which the laws of physics\ntake their canonical form, to include frames adapted to any arbitrary\nmotions. More specifically, since the class of all continuous and\ndifferentiable coordinate systems includes as a proper subclass the\ncoordinate systems adapted to any such frame of reference, if he could\nachieve a theory of gravitation, electromagnetism and mechanics that\nwas generally covariant \u2013 its equations taking the same\nform in any coordinate system from this general class \u2013 then the\ncomplete relativity of motion would be achieved. If there are no\nspecial frames of reference in which the laws take on a simpler\ncanonical form, there is no physical reason to consider any particular\nstate or states of motion as privileged, nor deviations from those as\nrepresenting \u2018absolute motion\u2019. (Here we are just laying\nout Einstein\u2019s train of thought; later we will see reasons to\nquestion the last step.) And in 1915, Einstein achieved his aim in the\nGeneral Theory of Relativity (GTR).\n",
