    "main_text": "The Second Period: An Encyclopedia of Philosophy || Theology\n6.3 Theology\n\nCicero\u2019s manifesto to write, in what proved to be his last\nperiod of literary production, encyclopedically about philosophy, is\nset out in the preface to his work of philosophical theology On\nthe Nature of the Gods. The daunting task he sets himself is\nlinked by him to the specific approach of the Academic sceptic. He\ncites with approval the example of Carneades, who by challenging Stoic\ntheology aroused in people a desire to discover the truth (1.4).\nCicero will take this one step further and aspire to examine\ncritically all the relevant theories about the gods. His conception of\na worthy philosophical encyclopedia is therefore much more than a\ndutiful trotting out of who thought what. His aim is to subject all\navailable views to scrutiny.\n\nIn Cicero\u2019s view this approach fits the questions of theology\nparticularly well, given the many and varied differences of opinion\nthat exist about the nature of the gods. It may be, he declares, that\nnone of the positions are correct; certainly, no more than one can be\n(1.5). The reader is thus put on notice that any view might in\nprinciple be overturned, and it is perhaps no surprise that Cicero\nsays he will need to respond to critics who claim that sceptical\nphilosophy, rather than providing illumination, \u2018floods things\nwith darkness\u2019 (1.6).\n\nIn response, he says that upon the verdict reached about the nature of\nthe gods will depend our assessment of the whole moral and material\napparatus of religion, including by implication traditional Roman\nreligion \u2013 indeed the examples he lists suggest that this is\nprimarily what he has in mind (1.14). When he speaks, at the very\nstart of the work, of its subject being one that was vital \u2018for\nthe regulation of religion\u2019 (1.1), one might easily read that\nconservatively: we investigate the gods in order better to maintain\nthe religious status quo. Now, however, it seems that our\ninvestigation is to be open, our sense of what (if any) is the correct\nreligion awaiting the outcome of enquiry into the nature of the\ngods.\n\nThe greater part of Book 1 is given over to an exposition of Epicurean\ntheology by Cicero\u2019s spokesman Velleius, followed by a critique\nfrom the work\u2019s representative of Academic scepticism, Cotta\n\u2013 Cicero also portrays a younger version of himself as holding\nmainly a listening brief at the discussion. Books 2 and 3 consist\nrespectively of exposition (by Balbus) and critique (by Cotta) of\nStoic theology, which, in stark contrast to the Epicurean version, has\ngod managing the workings of the universe down to the smallest\ndetail.\n\nThe Epicurean gods, on Velleius\u2019 telling, live a life of utter\ntranquility. They have no business to attend to; they simply take\npleasure in their own wisdom and virtue, secure in the knowledge that\ntheir bliss will be everlasting (1.51). Since they have no troubles,\nthey are not involved in the laborious business of creating or\ngoverning the universe, which arises and is sustained by the\nclustering of atoms in the void; they likewise have no concern with\nthe travails of human life (1.52\u201354). This does not, however,\nmean that they are not rightly objects of piety and reverence: we\nworship the sublimity of their nature (1.56).\n\nWe can discern a coherent, if hardly uncontroversial, theological\naccount here. Having previously criticised his opponents for not\nsetting out a clear roster of divine attributes, Velleius is at pains\nto do that himself. The gods are, in a nutshell, immortal, beautiful\nand happy, with the corollaries of happiness meaning that they are\nvirtuous and wise as well. Happiness is inconsistent with making or\nhaving trouble, so god is completely and everlastingly tranquil and at\nrest, enjoying the bliss of that state. Underlying this account is\nwhat one might call a negative principle: god must not exhibit any\nweakness or imperfection. If we now consider the maxim of Epicurus\nthat Velleius cites about the blessed and eternal, its unfolding of\nwhat such a state implies is framed entirely negatively: it does not\nhave troubles or make trouble for others, nor is it in the grip of\nanger or partiality since each is a sign of weakness (1.45). We might\nagree that the concept of god has to be that of a perfect being. And\nconceiving of perfection in terms of a lack of negative qualities is\none way to substantiate what perfection might mean.\n\nThe Epicurean viewpoint also has implications for how we are to\nconsider the relation between god and religion. Velleius\u2019\ninsistence on an anthropomorphic conception of god (1.46\u20138) is,\nin part, motivated by a desire to do justice to the traditional Greek\npicture of the gods \u2013 and, for that matter, the traditional\nRoman one, which shared an anthropomorphic conception with, and was\ndeeply influenced by, the Greek inheritance. Equally, however,\nVelleius takes aim at traditional poetic representations of the gods\nas badly behaved humans on a larger scale. There is, in a correct\nconception of divinity, no place for war, strife, lust, anger or other\nviolent emotions (1.42). And Velleius has little time for ordinary\npeople\u2019s views about the gods, which he dismisses as\n\u2018mired in the greatest inconsistency through their ignorance of\nthe truth\u2019 (1.43).\n\nCicero\u2019s agile use of the dialogue form is manifest in\nCotta\u2019s response. He picks up on an aspect of the Epicurean\nmethod as Velleius had described it, namely that we must infer the\nexistence of the gods from the fact that everyone has a conception (if\noften a distorted conception) that the gods exist. Cotta is happy for\npresent purposes to grant the existence of god, while registering his\ndissatisfaction with both the idea that the belief is universally\nheld, and the notion that, if it were, this would justify inferring\nits truth.\n\nHowever, Cotta also says that while it might be difficult to deny the\nexistence of the gods in a public assembly, it should be easy to do so\nin the sort of meeting they are currently having (1.61). He later adds\nthe thesis that anthropomorphic gods were either thought up by\nphilosophers to encourage ordinary people to turn from vice to worship\nor were a product of a superstition that considered that the worship\nof concrete images allowed access to the gods themselves (1.77). He\nthen presses the idea that the non-interventionist gods of the\nEpicureans are fatal to religion (1.116\u20137, 1.121), while\ncharacterising under the same heading, as \u2018utterly destructive\nof religion\u2019, those who claim that the notion of immortal gods\nis a fiction invented by the wise to lead people unsusceptible to\nreason to do, through religion, their duty (1.118). Cotta does not say\nthat this analysis of the origin of the gods is incorrect; rather, he\nimplies that its public dissemination would undermine the very aim\nthat the analysis posits as an explanation.\n\nWe are back to the question of the relation between one\u2019s theory\nand one\u2019s public pronouncements. On this occasion, Cotta\u2019s\nown stance may seem both cynical and hypocritical: to maintain social\norder one must suppress one\u2019s own views, while reserving\nfrankness for private gatherings of the philosophically minded. Yet\nhere the formal difference between Cicero the author and Cotta the\ncharacter is important. If, within the dramatic setting of On the\nNature of the Gods, the gathering is indeed as Cotta describes,\nits embedding in a written work that Cicero intends to be read more\nwidely blurs the line between private and public on which the charge\nof hypocrisy rests. If Cotta can be convicted of hypocrisy, it is less\nclear that Cicero is open to the same charge. He has let the cat out\nof the bag, and in so doing raised the vital question, for any reader,\nof the extent to which unrestricted frankness of speech can co-exist\nwith the maintenance of social order.\n\nThe Stoic theology expounded next by Balbus seems less immediately\nvulnerable to these practical concerns; here there is a parallel with\nthe respective treatments of the schools\u2019 ethical theories in\nOn Ends. Indeed, while Velleius relied on a relatively\ntechnical and abstract approach in his exposition of the Epicurean\nview, Balbus offers in Stoicism a theology that seems targeted rather\nspecifically at a Roman audience, and this in two distinct ways.\nFirst, the less technical presentation encourages readers who are\nunwilling or unable to enter the more tangled thickets of\nphilosophical theory to engage with the basic ideas. Second, it\npromises to appeal to a Roman sense of specialness and pride in their\nnation by portraying the gods themselves as certifying that attitude\nthrough the interest they take in the wellbeing of Rome.\n\nThus, having separated out \u2018our [Roman] people\u2019 as bearers\nof the belief in gods\u2019 existence, Balbus proceeds to declare\nthat the ever-increasing strength (as he sees it) of religious belief\nis no accident given the way the gods have concretely manifested their\npower. He then cites examples, from both distant and more recent Roman\nmilitary history, of gods seen fighting on the side of Rome, or acting\nas messengers of Roman victory (2.6). He follows this up with tales of\nhow divine premonitions were sent by the gods to warn Rome away from\nimpending disaster, with dire consequences when they were ignored\n(2.7\u20138).\n\nIn fact, Balbus\u2019 lengthy speech both begins and ends with the\nplacing of Rome at the forefront of divine providence. Towards the\nclose of his speech, having argued for the thesis that the care of the\ngods is, to be sure, directed at the whole human race (2.164), he then\ngradually zooms in, first to the specific regions of the world, with\nEurope listed first; then to particular cities, with Rome listed\nfirst; and finally to individuals, all of whom happen to be Romans who\nachieved significant military success (2.165), though there is a nod\nto Greece and the Homeric heroes to bring up the rear.\n\nHence, in terms of the structure of his speech, one of the chief\npoints of theological doctrine that distinguishes the Stoic view from\nthe Epicurean \u2013 namely that the gods are concerned with human\nwellbeing and actively promote it \u2013 becomes, in Balbus\u2019\nhands, the notion that this providential outlook has Rome not as its\nexclusive but certainly as its primary focus. On the face of it, this\nseems like a shrewd strategy: a Roman audience is, perhaps, more\nlikely to be won over by an account that shows the gods as\nRome\u2019s best friend than by one that shuns any notion of divine\nfavour.\n\nYet there is also, from the point of view of the dramatic context,\nsomething peculiar about this approach. Balbus, it is true, is\nconversing with a group of staunch Romans. But they are also Romans\nwhose philosophical sophistication has been emphasised. Is recounting\ntales of divine support for the Roman enterprise really the best way\nto persuade such an audience of the truth of one\u2019s philosophical\nposition? The short answer, of course, is that Cicero\u2019s intended\naudience is wider and no doubt on average less philosophically\nsophisticated than the interlocutors at the scene. But there is a bit\nmore going on than this.\n\nIn Book 1 Velleius\u2019 lucidity of exposition was pointedly\ncontrasted by Cotta with more typical Epicurean obscurity (notably in\nEpicurus himself) in a way that seemed to warn that change of style\ndoes not necessarily leave substance untouched. Balbus in turn speaks\nof the advantages of his own full and rich style over the more\ncompressed argumentative method found in the Stoic theoreticians, in\nparticular Stoicism\u2019s founder Zeno of Citium. But he does so in\na way calculated by Cicero to raise our suspicions: my style of\npresentation, says Balbus, flows like a river; and just as flowing\nrivers avoid being polluted much better than do enclosed pools, so too\nmy stream of eloquence will dilute a critic\u2019s protestations,\nwhile a closely reasoned argument cannot so easily protect itself\n(2.20).\n\nThis is surely intended by Cicero to seem disquieting. If arguments\nneed a cloak of rhetorical eloquence to save them from refutation,\nthen the ideas in support of which those arguments are advanced might,\non reflection, appear less, not more, convincing. Balbus then gives a\nbrief list of some of Zeno\u2019s succinct deductive arguments in\nfavour of the universe being intelligent, wise, happy and eternal, and\ntherefore divine (2.21). So even as Balbus tells us that a more\nflowing presentation has a better chance of evading the\n\u2018calumnies\u2019 of the Academic critics (2.20), we as readers\nare offered the chance by Cicero to exercise our critical judgement on\nsome concrete arguments, while reflecting, in equally critical vein,\non the issue of how philosophy can be communicated without either the\nalienation of excessive technicality or the distortion of an overly\nsmooth rhetoric.\n\nThe issue is then shown to have particular pertinence when religion is\nto the forefront. In his response to Balbus, Cotta, who also held the\nRoman office of priest, picks up on Balbus\u2019 plea, at the end of\nBook 2, that Cotta support Stoic doctrine, by asserting that by this\nwas no doubt meant that he should uphold the ancestral beliefs about\nthe gods and about religious practice \u2013 and, he adds, no\ndiscourse will ever turn him away from such beliefs (3.5). As a Roman\naristocrat of distinguished ancestry and as a priest, it behooves\nCotta to accept ancestral precedent even without rational argument;\nbut, since Balbus is a philosopher, the latter ought to give such\nargument in defence of his claims (3.6). For Cotta, ancestral\nauthority suffices for his belief that the gods exist (3.7, 3.9),\nwhereas Balbus, since he \u2018despises authority\u2019, must fight\nusing reason alone. So, in responding to him, Cotta will pitch his own\nreason against Balbus\u2019 (3.9).\n\nIt seems rather alarming that Cotta the avowed sceptic should tell us\nthat he accepts positions on authority rather than through reason and\nimply that he (unlike Balbus) is no philosopher. One has some sympathy\nwith Balbus\u2019 riposte that, if Cotta is already convinced that\nthe gods exist, why should he want anything from him? (3.7). Of\ncourse, Cotta as a proponent of scepticism is prepared to use the\nweapons of reason against a philosopher. But one suspects that there\nis more to his disclaimers than a sly false modesty designed to\nprovoke Balbus. We might think that appeal to authority is, in the\nreligious case, very much to the point.\n\nReligions are not free-floating products of reason. They are based on\ntradition and the establishment of authority. Tradition of course is\nitself a product of evolution over time. But once something can be\ntalked of as a religion, it already has in place structures and a\nhistory that can be seen to be reasonably deep-rooted and which,\nalthough it can evolve, must retain a sense of connection with those\nroots. In the religious context, tradition rather than reason is the\nprincipal authority, whether that be located in founding figures or\ndocuments, in time-honoured ceremonies and rituals, or in leaders who\ncan claim to inherit the mantle of authority via their own devotion to\nthe tradition \u2013 in the Roman context, the high priests whom\nCotta affirms that he defers to on religious matters, rather than\nStoic theorists (3.5).\n\nCotta has put his finger on something important about the role of\nauthority in religion. If one calls the authority of tradition into\nquestion, then one risks having no religion left. And if one of the\npurposes of religion is, from a practical point of view \u2013 both\nin the Roman context and surely more widely \u2013 the promotion of a\nsense of social cohesion and communal identity, then to challenge\ntradition is to threaten those objectives. So Cotta\u2019s remarks on\nauthority are not an evasion of Balbus\u2019 closing challenge, but\nan acknowledgement of what it means to have a religious commitment in\nthe first place. Cotta\u2019s position here has plausibly been seen\n(Wynne 2019, 167) as an inspiration for fideism, the view that faith\nor tradition is a justificatory source of religious belief independent\nof reason.\n\nWe might nonetheless wonder whether Cotta can compartmentalise things\nso straightforwardly as to be governed by tradition from the point of\nview of his religious and Roman identity, and by reason when it comes\nto philosophical discourse. Here Cotta\u2019s implication that he is\nnot a philosopher perhaps recognises something crucial about the\nnature of reason. The problem is not exactly that one might have\ndifferent approaches in different contexts; in principle, that might\nbe a perfectly sensible way to proceed. It is, rather, that if one\ndemonstrates by reason that, for example, the gods do not exist, then\nthe gods do not exist. Reason is not a compartment in which one can\nstore a certain set of beliefs or conclusions that need not carry over\nto other areas of one\u2019s life. It is an integral part of the\nclaim of reason that its claim is a universal one.\n\nThe tension between reason and tradition is not, then, to be resolved\nsimply by carving out, for example, separate spaces for religion on\nthe one hand and philosophy on the other. At the same time religion\nitself has something important to tell us about the nature of belief.\nWhen Cotta scoffs at Balbus\u2019 assertion, from his main speech,\nthat the tales of gods appearing to us in human form provide evidence\nof their existence, Balbus responds by saying that surely ancient\nauthority must carry some weight with Cotta. To this Cotta replies,\nalong previous lines, that Balbus is offering \u2018hearsay when what\nI ask for is reason\u2019 (3.13). Balbus, as before, owes Cotta a\nrational defence of Stoic claims even if Cotta\u2019s own beliefs do\nnot, and are apparently not required to, rest on such a defence.\n\nThis contrast between beliefs based on hearsay and on rational\njustification invites us to consider what it would be like if the\nlatter were given the unrestricted scope that it seems to demand.\nCotta\u2019s hiving off to the realm of the philosopher the task of\ngiving rational explanations suggests that the role of reason might,\nin fact, have its limits. If, for example, rational justification were\nthe only acceptable basis for holding a belief, it is difficult to\nimagine that one would hold many, or any, beliefs at all. Certainly,\nmany if not most of our beliefs are ones that we simply find ourselves\nwith \u2013 acquired on the authority of \u2018hearsay\u2019,\nwhether that be parents, friends, books, teachers, religious leaders,\npublic figures, or any other source that may not necessarily have\noffered a strict rational justification for claims that we come to\nbelieve.\n\nNow the beliefs that we do come to hold can then be subject to\nrational scrutiny; this notion is at the core of the sceptical\napproach that Cotta, and of course Cicero himself, espouse. But to\nmake sense even of this it seems that we have to take some beliefs as\ngiven in order to find a perspective from which to rationally assess\nothers. A project in which all one\u2019s beliefs are simultaneously\nsubject to the test of rational justification is incoherent. And from\na practical point of view, if we only acted on the basis of those\nbeliefs that had been subject to, and survived, rational scrutiny, we\nwould scarcely act at all.\n\nIf so, then it is not simply a case of religion deferring to reason.\nBeliefs we hold without the legitimation of reason have a necessary\nplace. The upshot seems to be that religious beliefs, insofar as they\neither are not or cannot be subject to rational defence, are more\nrepresentative than one might have supposed of the beliefs we hold\nmore generally. In this regard, On the Nature of the Gods is\nnot uncharacteristic of Cicero\u2019s whole approach to philosophy:\nhe uses his characters\u2019 debates both to advertise the virtues of\nrational enquiry, and to suggest that those virtues reach right the\nway up, as perhaps they should, to the status of rational enquiry\nitself.\n",
