Were the\nmajor transitions in hereditary thought to be described as scientific\nrevolutions (see entries on\n scientific revolutions\n and\n the incommensurability of scientific theories)?\n It seems that models of change emphasizing discontinuity and\nincommensurability among successive paradigms, such as Thomas\nKuhn\u2019s (1962), do not fit well with what can be observed in the\nhistory of genetics: Much terminology and many practices seem to\nremain intact despite constant theoretical novelty, and the\ndevelopments do not appear to be perceived as discontinuous in a\nstrong sense by the protagonists. Continuous models of change,\ndeveloped earlier by logical empiricists and centered on the notion of\nreduction as a relation between earlier and later theories, were thus\ndiscussed as possible alternatives with respect to the history of\ngenetics.\n\n\u201cReductionism\u201d in genetics can, on the one hand, refer to\nphilosophical positions regarding theory reduction or reductive\nexplanation. On the other hand, attitudes in biology and philosophy\nthat are characterized by a preference for molecular over organismic\naccounts of biological phenomena or an emphasis on genes in\nexplanations have been labeled \u201creductionist\u201d (see entry\non\n reductionism in biology).\n The latter, broader meaning overlaps with notions of \u201cgenetic\ndeterminism\u201d and, more generally, \u201cgene-centrism\u201d.\nThis section focuses on the former, technical meanings of\n\u201creduction\u201d. The debate on reduction got contemporary\nphilosophy of biology started around 1970 and is still on-going today\n(Vidal & Teira 2020; Winther 2009). Theory reduction is most\nprominently articulated by Ernest Nagel (1961). Put very simply, on\nNagel\u2019s account, one theory reduces to another if the former can\nbe logically derived from the latter, or, in terms of a\nnomological-deductive model of explanation, if the reducing theory\nexplains the reduced theory. Since, on this view, the relation between\ntheories is one between sets of statements, including, most\nimportantly, laws or law-like generalizations, successful reduction\nalso requires \u201cbridge principles\u201d or coordinating\ndefinitions, which indicate how the vocabularies (terms or predicates)\nof the two theories relate (see entry on\n scientific reduction).\n\nKenneth Schaffner (1967, 1969) further develops Nagel\u2019s account\nby pointing out that the candidate reduced theory typically needs to\nbe corrected before it can be reduced. He then applies his model to\nthe case of genetics. On Schaffner\u2019s view, molecular genetics\nreduced or is in the process of reducing classical genetics (see\n \u00a71.2\n and\n \u00a71.3\n for an account of classical and molecular genetics). On his account,\nthe genes of classical genetics can be identified with DNA sequences.\nFurthermore, concepts that capture law-like generalizations about\nphenomena in classical genetics (e.g., dominance) can be explained\nthrough generalizations on the molecular level. Schaffner\u2019s\naccount is met with criticism by David Hull (1972, 1974). Hull\u2019s\nmost influential objection rests on a multiple realizability argument.\nHe argues that the types of phenomena identified in classical genetics\n(such as dominance) can be instantiated by a variety of different\nmolecular constellations. Furthermore, Hull points out that any\nmolecular entity or mechanism can be involved in various types of\nsituations as described in classical genetics. Accordingly, Hull\ndiagnoses many-many relations between molecular phenomena and\nphenomena identified through cytological and phenotypic analysis.\n\nAlexander Rosenberg (1978; 1985: Ch. 4) argues that Mendelian\nproperties supervene on molecular properties, i.e., that for any\ndifference in Mendelian properties there is a difference in molecular\nproperties. Thus, even if theory reduction is not available, the facts\nof Mendelian genetics can be ontologically reduced to facts of\nmolecular genetics. Others describe this situation by observing that\nwhile token-token reduction is possible, type-type reduction is not to\nbe had (Kimbrough 1979). Closer to a Kuhnian notion of\nincommensurability is Michael Ruse\u2019s (1971) reconstruction,\naccording to which the Mendelian gene and the molecular gene are\nincompatible concepts. One reason is that the former was treated as a\nunit of function, recombination, and mutation, while the latter is\nnot. Furthermore, molecular genetics explains everything that is\nexplained by Mendelian genetics and more; it has more explanatory\npower and is more accurate. Hence, according to Ruse, molecular\ngenetics does not reduce, but replaces Mendelian genetics. Others\ndefend the thesis that Mendelian genetics in its original version is\nreduced by molecular genetics (e.g., Goosens 1978).\n\nAnother, influential set of challenges to theory reduction in genetics\nis posed by Philip Kitcher (1984). The main problem, and indeed one\nthat is fundamental to any account of theory reduction that identifies\ntheories with sets of laws, is that there are no laws in classical\ngenetics. Even seemingly straightforward examples such as what came to\nbe called \u201cMendel\u2019s laws\u201d, as Kitcher shows, are\nneither laws, nor do they play an important explanatory role in\nclassical genetics. Kitcher further argues that the basic predicates\nof classical genetics, such as \u201cx is a gene\u201d\ncannot be unequivocally connected to the vocabulary of molecular\ngenetics through bridge principles, as it would be required for\nsuccessful theory reduction. Finally, even if these two issues were\nsolved, an account based on the principles of molecular genetics would\nnot explain the phenomena of classical genetics any better than the\ncytological explanations already in place. Others argue against this\ndisunified picture of Mendelian and molecular genetics that the two\nfields depend on each other in their practices. This interdependence,\nhowever, also precludes an eliminative reduction (i.e., replacement)\n(Vance 1996).\n\nSeveral authors suggest that the debates on in-principle reducibility\nare far removed from explanatory practice in molecular genetics.\nWimsatt (1974) highlights theories of inter-level relations and how\nthey facilitate mechanistic explanations (see the entry on \n mechanisms in science). \n Pointing towards a sematic view of theory, which holds that\ntheories are families of related models, Waters (1990, 1994) maintains\nthat molecular genetics provides explanations for phenomena described\nby Mendelian theory. The basis for this is that both fields rely on\nthe principle that only phenotypic differences in a population, rather\nthan the presence of traits is explained by genes (or rather by\ngenetic differences). While these authors still speak of theoretical\nreduction, theory has changed its status. Rather than one theory\ncontaining laws being reduced by another theory through logical\ndeduction, theory is conceived in terms of explanatory models which\nmediate the conceptual and practical relations between Mendelian and\nmolecular genetics.\n\nSubsequently, the emphasis of philosophical debates shifts more\ntowards explanatory reduction (H\u00fcttemann & Love 2011; Kaiser\n2015; Rosenberg 2006; Sarkar 1998). The question becomes less one of\nthe relations between Mendelian genetics and molecular genetics, but\nrather whether organismic phenomena from heredity to development to\nevolution can or should be explained in molecular terms (see\n \u00a71.4).\n\nThis section was concerned with the relation of the theories in which\ngene concepts are embedded from the perspective of scientific change.\nThe next section will address scientific change on the level of the\ngene concept itself, where the focus is on the question to what extent\nsuch concepts remain constant regarding reference and meaning when\ntheories and practices change.\n",
