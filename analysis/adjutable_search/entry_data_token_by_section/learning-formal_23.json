Reliable Learning for Statistical Hypotheses\n\nStatistical hypotheses are the most common in practical data-driven\ndecision making, for example in the sciences and engineering. It is\ntherefore important for a philosophical framework of inductive\ninference to include statistical hypotheses. There are two key\ndifferences between statistical hypotheses and the hypotheses sets we\nhave considered so far [Sober 2015].\n\nThe relationship between observations and a hypothesis is\nprobabilistic, not deductive: A statistical hypothesis assigns a\nprobability to an observation sequence, typically between 0 and 1. A\ndeductive hypothesis is either consistent with an observation sequence\nor falsified.\nThe analysis of statistical hypotheses typically assumes that\nobservations form a random sample: successive observations\nare independent of each other and follow the same distribution. It is\npossible to analyze statistical methods where later observations\ndepend on current observations, but the mathematical complexity of\ninductive methodology is much greater than with independent data.\n\n\nBecause of these properties, learning theory for nonstatistical\nmethods is a more straightforward framework than statistics for\ntraditional philosophical discussions in epistemology, inductive\ninference, and the philosophy of science. For example, epistemological\ndiscussions of justified true belief concern a deductive concept of\nbelief where the inquirer accepts a proposition, rather than assign a\nprobability to data. Scientific theories typically make a\ndeterministic prediction of future data from past observations\n(initial conditions), so an independence requirement makes it more\ndifficult to apply a methodological framework to understand scientific\ninquiry (see our\n case studies).\n\nNormative means-ends epistemology can be applied to statistical\nhypotheses as well as deductive ones. In particular we will discuss\nhow the ideas of reliable convergence to the truth and minimizing\nregressive mind changes can be adapted to the statistical setting. The\nkey idea is to shift the unit of analysis: Whereas previously we\nconsidered the behavior of an inductive method for a specific data\nsequence, in statistical analysis we consider its aggregate\nbehavior over a set of data sequences of the same length. In\nparticular, we consider the probability that a method conjectures\na hypothesis H for a given number of observations \\(n.\\)\nPreliminaries on Statistical Hypotheses\n\nWe will illustrate the main ideas with a classic simple example,\nobserving coin flips, and indicate how they can be generalized to more\ncomplex hypotheses. For more details please see [Genin and Kelly 2017,\nGenin 2018]. Suppose that an investigator has a question about the\nunknown bias \\(p\\) of a coin, where \\(p\\) represents the chance that a\nsingle flip comes out \u201cHeads\u201d. Different possible\nhypotheses correspond to different ranges of the bias \\(p\\), that is,\na partition of [0,1], the range of the bias. Let us say that the\ninvestigator asks a simple point hypothesis: is the coin\nfair? Then we have\n\n\\(H_1 =\\) \u201c\\(p = 0.5\\)\u201d\n\\(H_2 =\\) \u201cit is not the case that \\(p = 0.5\\)\u201d.\nThat is, either \\(p \\lt 0.5\\) or \\(p \\gt 0.5.\\)\n\n\nExtending our previous terminology, we shall say that a true bias\nvalue \\(p\\) is for a hypothesis H if it lies within the\nset specified by \\(H\\). In our example, a bias value p\nis correct for \\(H_1\\) if and only if \\(p = 0.5\\); otherwise\n\\(p\\) is correct for \\(H_2\\). Given a true bias value \\(p\\),\nand assuming independence, we can compute a probability for any\nfinite sequence of observations. This probability is known as the\nsample distribution. For example, for a fair coin with \\(p = 0.5,\\)\nthe probability of observing 3 heads is \\(0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 =\n0.125.\\) If the chance of heads is 0.7, the probability of observing 3\nheads is \\(0.7 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.7 = 0.343.\\) Notice how the\nindependence assumption allows us to compute the probability of a\nsequence of observations as the product of single observation\nprobabilities. Without the independence assumption, we cannot infer\nthe probability of multiple observations from the probability of a\nsingle observation, and the sample distribution is not defined. \n\nAs usual in this entry, an inductive method conjectures a hypothesis\nafter observing a finite sequence of observations. A method that\nconjectures a statistical hypothesis is called a statistical\ntest (see the link in the Other Internet Resource section below).\nThe statistical literature provides an extensive collection of\ncomputationally efficient statistical tests for different types of\nstatistical hypothesis. In the following discussion we consider the\ngeneral learning performance of such methods, with respect to reliable\nconvergence to a true hypothesis and avoiding mind changes. Consider a\nfixed observation length \\(n,\\) called the\nsample size. For sample size \\(n\\), there is a set of\nsamples of length \\(n\\) such that the method conjectures\nhypothesis \\(H\\)given the sample. For example, for \\(n =\n3\\), the method might conjecture \\(H_2 =\\) \u201cthe coin is not\nfair\u201d after observing 3 heads. The aggregate probability that\nthe method outputs hypothesis \\(H\\) given some sample of\nlength \\(n\\), is the sum of the sample probabilities of the\nsamples such that the method conjectures \\(H\\) given the sample.\nIn the supplement we give example computations of the aggregate\nprobability. Because this aggregate probability is the key quantity\nfor the methodology of statistical hypotheses, we introduce the\nfollowing notation for it.\n\n\n\\(P_{n,p}(H) =\\) the probability that a given inductive\nmethod conjectures hypothesis \\(H\\) after \\(n\\)\nobservations, given that the true probability of a single observation\nis \\(p\\)\n\n\nIn nonstatistical learning, we required a reliable method to\neventually settle on true hypothesis after sufficiently many\nobservations. The statistical version of this criterion is that after\nsufficiently many observations, the chance of conjecturing the true\nhypothesis should approach 100%. More technically, say that a method\nidentifies a true statistical hypothesis in chance if for\nevery bias value \\(p\\), and for every threshold \\(0\\lt t \\lt 1\\),\nthere is a sample size \\(n\\) such that for all larger sample sizes,\nthe method conjectures the hypothesis \\(H\\) that is true for \\(p\\)\nwith at least probability \\(t\\). In symbols, we have \\(P_{n',p}(H) \\gt\nt\\) for all sample sizes \\(n' \\gt n\\), where \\(H\\) is the hypothesis\nthat is true for \\(p\\). The figure below illustrates how the chance of\nconjecturing the true hypothesis increases with sample size, whereas\nthe chance of conjecturing a false hypothesis decreases with sample\nsize. The definition can be generalized to more complex statistical\nhypotheses by replacing the true bias value \\(p\\) with a list of\nparameters.\n\n\nFigure 8 [An extended description of figure 8 is in a supplement.]\n\n\nThe notion of limiting identification in chance is similar to the\nconcept of limiting convergence to a probability estimate in\n Reichenbach\u2019s pragmatic vindication.\n Translated to our example, Reichenbach considered inductive rules\nthat output an estimate of the true bias value \\(p,\\) and\nrequired that such a rule converges to the true value, in the sense\nthat for every every bias value \\(p\\), and for every threshold\n\\(0\\lt t \\lt 1\\), there is a sample size \\(n\\) such that\nfor all larger sample sizes, with probability 1 the rule outputs an\nestimate that differs from the true value \\(p\\) by at most\n\\(t\\). In statistics, a method is called consistent if\nwith increasing sample size, the method\u2019s chance of conjecturing\na correct answer converges to 100% (see the link in the Other Internet\nResources section below). The terminology is unfortunate in that it\nsuggests to philosophical readers a connection with the consistency of\na formal proof system. In fact, the statistical concept of consistency\nhas nothing to do with deductive logic; rather, it is a probabilistic\nanalogue of the notion of identification in the limit of inquiry that\nis the main subject of this entry. \n\nGenin and Kelly provide a characterization theorem that provides\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for a set of statistical\nhypotheses to be identifiable in chance, analogous to the structural\nconditions we discussed in\n Section 3.3\n [2017; Theorem 4.3]. Genin [2018] discusses a statistical analogue of\nthe requirement of minimizing mind changes. Recall that a regressive\nmind change occurs when an inquirer abandons a true hypothesis in\nfavor of a false one\n Section 4.3.\n The probabilistic analogue is a chance reversal, which\noccurs when the chance of conjecturing a true hypotheses decreases as\nthe sample size increases. For instance, consider the question of\nwhether a vaccine is effective for an infectious disease. Suppose the\nvaccine manufacture runs a trial with 1000 patients and has designed a\nstatistical method that has a chance of 90% of correctly indicating\nthat the vaccine is effective when that is indeed the case. Now\nanother trial is run with 1500 patients using the same statistical\nmethod. A chance reversal would occur if the method\u2019s chance of\ncorrectly indicating that the vaccine is effective drops to 80%. As\nthis example illustrates, a chance reversal corresponds to a failure\nto replicate a true result. A chance reversal is illustrated in the\nFigure above, where the chance of conjecturing the true hypothesis is\nsmaller for 2 samples than for 3. Although chance reversals are\nclearly undesirable, they are difficult to avoid, and in fact commonly\nused statistical methods are liable to such reversals [Genin 2018]. A\nmore feasible goal is to bound the reversals by a threshold \\(t\\),\nsuch that if the chance of conjecturing the truth does decreases with\nincreasing sample size, it decreases by at most \\(t.\\) (In symbols,\n\\(P_{n,p}(H) - P_{n+1,p}(H) \\lt t\\) for all sample sizes \\(n\\) and\ntrue bias values \\(p\\), where \\(H\\) is the hypothesis correct for\n\\(p\\).) Genin [2018] shows that bounded chance reversal are feasible\nin many situations, and provides an Ockham theorem that elucidates the\nconstraints that bounding chance reversals provides on statistical\nhypothesis learning. \n",
