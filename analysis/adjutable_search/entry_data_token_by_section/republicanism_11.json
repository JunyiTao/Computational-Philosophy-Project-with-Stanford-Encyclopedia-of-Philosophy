    "main_text": "The Contemporary Republican Program\n4. The Contemporary Republican Program\n\nHowever interesting the debates discussed in the previous section, one\nmay still wonder whether republicanism has anything valuable to\ncontribute to contemporary normative political theory and philosophy.\nOne reason many people remain skeptical has to do with the fact that\nthe classical republican writings often express views that are\ndecidedly elitist, patriarchal, and militaristic. How could the basis\nfor an appealing contemporary political program be found in such\nwritings (Goldsmith 2000; Maddox 2002; Goodin 2003; McCormick\n2003)?\n\nThat the classical republicans often expressed these very unappealing\nviews is not disputed. But what are we to make of this fact? There are\ntwo possibilities. On the one hand, the parochialism of the classical\nrepublicans might reflect logical consequences of their core value\ncommitments, in which case we cannot adopt the latter without taking\non board the former. On the other hand, it might merely reflect the\naccidental prejudices of their day, in which case it can easily be\ndispensed with as we modernize the republican program. Now according\nto the civic humanist reading of the tradition, the classical\nrepublicans were committed to a perfectionist conception of the human\ngood as active citizenship and civic virtue. On this view, it is clear\nthat some individuals will be more successful than others in attaining\nthe good so understood\u2014some are more adept at politics than\nothers, some are more capable of heroic displays of virtue than\nothers, and so on. Indeed, political power and public honor are, to\nsome extent, positional goods, meaning that their distribution among\nthe members of a community will necessarily be unequal. It follows\nthat, on the civic humanist reading of the tradition, the elitist bent\nof the classical republican writings is a consequence of their core\nvalues. As Arendt writes, it is \u201cthe sign of a well-ordered\nrepublic\u201d that only the politically virtuous elite \u201cwould\nhave the right to be heard in the conduct of the business of the\nrepublic\u201d (1963, 279).\n\nThe civic republicans, naturally, reject this view. There is nothing\ninherently elitist about the ideal of freedom when this is understood\nnegatively as independence from arbitrary or uncontrolled power. The\nclassical republicans, to be sure, typically confined the extension of\nthis ideal to a narrow range of propertied, native-born male citizens.\nBut on the civic republican reading of the tradition, this merely\nreflects an unnecessary prejudice we can easily dispense with. The\nelitism of the tradition long concealed the potentially radical\nimplications of freedom as non-domination; suitably universalized now\nat last, republicanism is revealed to be a strikingly progressive\npolitical doctrine (Pettit 1997, 2014; Maynor 2003; Gourevitch\n2015).\n\nThe remainder of this section will sketch some of the wide-ranging\napplications of a universalized republicanism, dedicated to the\npromotion of freedom as non-domination. Much of the contemporary\nrepublican program, as one would expect, bears some familial\nrelationship with the political commitments of the classical\nrepublicans. There are also divergences, however. Contemporary civic\nrepublicans draw inspiration from the classical tradition, but they do\nnot aim to anachronistically implement the republicanism of yore for\nits own sake.\n",
