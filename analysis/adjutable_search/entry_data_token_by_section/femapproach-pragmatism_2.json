    "main_text": "Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes\n3. Pragmatist Feminist Philosophical Themes\n\nContemporary feminists are also implementing and extending pragmatist\nphilosophies as a foundation for feminist theory. These feminist\nphilosophers working in the pragmatist tradition point out that\npragmatism offers a valuable, although often unrecognized, resource\nfor feminist thinkers, especially as it is developed in the work of\nwomen pragmatists and activists. We see this particularly in feminist\npragmatist writings on experience, epistemology, education and social\naction.\n\nFor example, contemporary feminists point out how traditional\nphilosophy\u2019s emphasis on rational, logical absolutes devalues\nthe ambiguities of the experience of an embodied life. For feminist\npragmatists, pluralistic communities have epistemological value and\nprovide the base for an inclusive problem-solving approach to social\nissues. The pragmatist understanding of education as a social and\npolitical force, as a major aspect of how society and individuals are\nshaped, has been echoed by contemporary feminists who analyze our\neducational curriculum and methods of teaching. Both pragmatism and\nfeminism are more likely to bring social context to the forefront of\nphilosophy, opening space for realities in flux, for emergent\nsituations to be shaped and reconstructed by their context.\nPragmatists emphasize that we must include particular and individual\nexperiences in a pluralistic discussion of multiple realities, and\nthat all parties involved in an issue also be involved in the\nproblem-solving\n process.[1]\n",
