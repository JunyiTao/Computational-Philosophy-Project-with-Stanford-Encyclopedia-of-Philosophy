    "main_text": "Life and Philosophical Development || Religion\n3.8 Religion\n\n\nAs well as Prior\u2019s journeyings between the hemispheres, there\nwas his seemingly complicated inner journey from religious believer to\nnon-believer. The inner journey, which is not easy to chart, was\ncomplete by the time he arrived in Manchester, and seems to have taken\nmany years. It may have begun in 1941, with Prior\u2019s developing\ninterest in psychoanalytic explanations of the origin of religious\nbeliefs (a topic first alluded to in Prior (1935)). In his September\n1942 publication \u2018Can Religion Be Discussed?\u2019\u2014a\ndialogue between five characters named Barthian Protestant, Modernist\nProtestant, Catholic, Logician, and Psychoanalyst\u2014Prior gave the\nclosing speech to Psychoanalyst, who explains that circumstances may\n\u2018push\u2019 a believer into\n\n\n\nan emotional crisis in which they will go mad unless they do\nsomething about it, and then in the painful process of their own\nanalysis they will see for themselves the roots of their urge to\nbelieve. Only in this way are genuine atheists made. (Prior 1942a:\n150)\n\n\n\nIf these remarks were autobiographical there is no hint of it within\nthe article. But Prior was more forthcoming in an unpublished\nseven-page manuscript dated 25 March 1942 (Prior 1942b, Jakobsen 2016).\nThere he made it clear that he no longer considered himself a\nChristian, speaking of his \u2018Christian days\u2019 in the past\ntense, and denying that his ongoing interest in theology was a\n\u2018relapse into Christianity\u2019.\n\n\nIn \u2018Can Religion Be Discussed?\u2019 Prior made Psychoanalyst\nsay \u2018it\u2019s the religious illusion that\u2019s\nirresistible\u2019, and in the 1942 manuscript he stated bluntly that\n\u2018Theology is an illusion\u2019, adding \u2018but it is an\nillusion that is somehow \u201cclose to life\u201d\u2019. In this\nmanuscript he mentioned Freud by name several times; and in a\ntypescript concerning the application of Freudian theory to religion,\npossibly also written in 1941 or 1942 (Prior n.d.c., Hasle 1999, 2012),\nPrior explored \u2018the hidden non-religious basis and source of all\nreligious worship\u2019. He spoke of \u2018breaking the religious\nspell\u2019 and of \u2018the subconscious roots of religion\u2019\nbeing \u2018laid bare\u2019. The \u2018Being\u2019 that the\nreligious \u2018refer to as the real object of worship\u2019 is,\nPrior suggested, \u2018all the time a fiction\u2019.\n\n\nPrior\u2019s position at this point, then, was seemingly that\nreligious discourse is a form of fictional discourse\u2014although the\nfiction is \u2018close to life\u2019. He also appears to have thought\nthat believers utilize what Psychoanalyst calls \u2018tricks\u2019 in\norder to prevent knowledge of the subconscious origins of this fiction\nfrom reaching their consciousness, and so breaking the religious spell\n(Prior 1942a: 146\u20137).\n\n\nPrior soon retreated from this leap toward unbelief. According to\nhis military record, he was a \u2018Presby\u2019 (Presbyterian) again\nby about 1944. But although his scepticism born of psychoanalysis had\nweakened, it seems this was eventually replaced by philosophical\nscepticism of a more ordinary sort. The New Zealand philosopher Jim\nThornton, who was Prior\u2019s student during the period\n1949\u20131953, recollected that \u2018at the time when I was one of\nhis senior students I got the impression that he thought Hume\u2019s\nscepticism on religious belief was impressive\u2019. Thornton\ncontinued \u2018He enjoyed drawing our attention to Hume\u2019s irony\nin various passages in the Dialogues Concerning Natural\nReligion, and also in the closing paragraph of the essay Of\nMiracles\u2019:\n\n\n\nMere reason is insufficient to convince us of its veracity: And\nwhoever is moved by Faith to assent to it, is conscious of a continued\nmiracle in his own person, which subverts all the principles of his\nunderstanding, and gives him a determination to believe\u2026 (Hume\n1777, 10.101)\n\n\n\nDespite his liking for Hume\u2019s scepticism, Prior took the\nserious step in 1951 of becoming an elder of St Martin\u2019s\nPresbyterian Church in Christchurch. Elders are responsible for the\nspiritual oversight of the congregation, and he was assigned a\n\u2018district\u2019 of perhaps 15\u201320 households drawn from the\ncongregation, and was expected to visit each of them regularly.\nWhatever his philosophical doubts may have been, Prior was now a pillar\nof the Presbyterian community. \u2018Lord, I believe; help thou mine\nunbelief!\u2019 he had made his Barthian Protestant character say in\n1942.\n\n\n1956, the year of Arthur\u2019s sabbatical in Oxford, seems to have\nbeen a turning point. Perhaps sheer distance helped to loosen\nreligion\u2019s tug, not only on him but also on Mary. Once back in\nNew Zealand, the family\u2019s churchgoing was much less regular.\nSpeaking of this time, their son Martin said \u2018I think Mary and\nArthur were starting to lapse in their beliefs\u2019. Arthur continued\nas an elder at St Martin\u2019s, officially until he left the country\nfor Manchester in December 1958, but ceased attending the monthly\nmeetings of elders from April 1958\u2014and contrary to custom, did\nnot even bother to send in his apologies for the meetings that he\nmissed.\n\n\nRobert Bull, who was Arthur\u2019s student from 1957, remembered him taking\nhis church duties flippantly. On one occasion Arthur broke off a\nconversation about logic with a puckish \u2018I\u2019ve got to go and\ndeliver the fucking communion cards\u2019. Mary laughed, exclaiming\n\u2018Arthur!\u2019. The cards were invitations to the communion\nservice and, as an elder, he was obliged to deliver one to each person\nin his district. By this time, the Priors\u2019 religious observance\nwas probably just a matter of not wanting to upset the boat\u2014and\nperhaps especially not the Reverend Frank Wilkinson, Mary\u2019s\nfather.\n\n\nOnce the Priors were in Manchester, churchgoing became a thing of\nthe past.\n",
