Passivity vs. activity\n\nHyletic data are arguably experiences, in the sense of\n\u201cnon-intentional\u201d, \u201cpre-reflective lived experiences\nthat can be grasped only abstractly in reflection\u201d (Gallagher\n2011, p. 3). At the same time, at least some of them (the\n\u201ckinaesthetic\u201d sensations; cf. Zahavi 2003, p. 107) belong\nto the sphere of bodily passivity: they \u201cserve in the\nconstitution of the experiencing body (the body-as-subject)\u201d\n(Gallagher 2011, p. 4; for the distinction between\n\u201cbody-as-subject\u201d and \u201cbody-as-object\u201d, cf.\nZahavi 2003, pp. 101\u2013106). The notion of passivity is given\nparticular emphasis both in the context of Husserl\u2019s\ngenetic-phenomenological analyses, focussing on the dynamic aspects of\nself- and object-constitution, and in his reply to the\n\u201cobjection of solipsism\u201d against transcendental\nphenomenology developed in the 5th of his Cartesian\nMeditations (see Section 10 below). In Experience and\nJudgement Husserl stresses \u201cthat the\ndistinction between activity and passivity is not a rigid one, that it\ncannot be a matter of terms that can be defined once and for all, but\nonly of means of description and contrast, the meaning of which must\noriginally be recreated in each individual case with regard to the\nconcrete situation of the analysis\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 119). On a\nplausible (i.e., epistemological) interpretation, a unit of\nconsciousness in which something constitutes itself is to be described\nas \u201cpassive\u201d just in case this constitution occurs\nindependently of any simultaneous execution of the subject\u2019s\nwill, e.g., its will to acquire knowledge; otherwise, it is to be\ndescribed as \u201cactive\u201d. Passive constitution is sometimes\nreferred to as \u201cpre-constitution\u201d, as it is an\nindispensible precondition for active constitution (cf. Landgrebe\n1982b, p. 72.) According to the above interpretation, active\nconstitution in the form of judgements in turn initiates beliefs as\npersonal \u201cacquisitions (Erwerbe)\u201d or\n\u201chabitualities\u201d that help pre-constitute the further\ncourse of experience, thus forming a \u201csecondary\u201d level of\npassivity (cf. ibid.; for an overview of Husserl\u2019s\n\u201cphenomenology of habituality\u201d cf. Moran 2011; Caminada\n2019 investigates into Husserl\u2019s view of habit against the\nbackground of the re-edition of Ideas II on the basis of his\noriginal texts; see esp. ch. 10f). \n\nIn the context of the analysis of the constitution of individual\nperceptual objects, the spatio-temporally structured \u201cfield of\npre-givenness\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 74) against whose background\nthe object stands out contrastively (ready to catch the\nperceiver\u2019s attention) counts as primarily passive (cf. Wu 2021,\nsec. 58). This field is structured by \u201csyntheses of\nassociation\u201d between (hyletic adumbrations of) similar and\ndissimilar elements (cf. Wu 2020, p. 189). These associative syntheses\nare such that (in the case at issue) one of those elements, e.g. a\ncolored three-dimensional (and thus non-hyletic; cf. Lee 1993, p. 99)\ndot, serves as sensual \u201cstimulus\u201d by \u201cinstinctively\ndriving\u201d (Husserliana Mat., vol. VIII, p. 326) the\nperceiver to attend to it unwillingly, thus passively\n\u201caffecting\u201d the perceiver (Husserliana, vol.\nXXXIII, pp. 275f; cf. Yamaguchi 1982; Lee 1993; also cf. Mensch 1997;\nand Brudzinska 2020, containing a detailed comparison with Freud). If\nthe stimulus then catches the subject\u2019s attention, it can\nsubsequently be \u201cexplicated\u201d perceptually according to its\nobjectual determinations, in which case the subject enters \u201cthe\nfirst main stage of the striving for knowledge, i.e. the\npre-predicative or receptive stage\u201d (Wu 2021, p.\n190). Thus, passivity precedes receptivity, which in turn precedes the\nsecond main stage, i.e. the \u201cpredicative\u201d stage \u2013\nthe level of the \u201cspontaneity\u201d of judgement (cf. Wu 2021,\np. 191). Both of these stages (the receptive and the spontaneous one)\nconstitute the level of cognitive \u201cactivity\u201d. At the\nsecond stage, the processing of mental files such as \u201cindividual\nnotions\u201d (see Section 4 above), guided by the subject\u2019s\n\u201cwill to knowledge\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 92), is located. In\nExperience and Judgement Husserl calls the\nperceptual acts motivating predicative file entries (i.e., habitual\nyet variable empirical beliefs) \u201cexplications\u201d of\nperceptual objects (cf. Husserl 1939, ch. 2). Such explications are\nfounded in \u201cattention as a tendency of the ego\u201d\n\u201ctoward the intentional object\u201d (Husserl 1939, p. 85).\n(For the multifarious use of the term \u201cattention\u201d in\nHusserl cf. the introduction to Husserliana, vol. XXXVIII, p.\nXXXII; see also the entry on \u201cAufmerksamkeit\u201d in Gander\n2010, pp. 36ff, and the secondary literature cited there, as well as\nBreyer 2011, ch. V, and Wehrle 2013, ch. I.)\n\nNote that while Husserl sometimes describes the field of pre-givenness\nin which pre-predicative and predicative acts are founded as\n\u201coriginarily passive\u201d (cf. Husserl 1939, p. 300), he holds\nthat this field is itself pre-constituted at an even more basic level\nof constitution, also sometimes (in another context) described as\noriginarily or primarily passive. This more basic level is the\n\u201cabsolutely\u201d originary one of (1) bodily and (2) temporal\npre-reflective self-consciousness, at which (1) the spatial and (2)\nthe temporal aspects of the field, respectively, constitute themselves\n(cf. Wu 2021, pp. 187f). This pre-constitution occurs automatically or\n\u201cinstinctively\u201d, by \u201cassociation\u201d of\n\u201cacquired\u201d affective \u201cdrives\u201d and\nteleologically directed \u201ccourses of drives\n(Triebverl\u00e4ufe)\u201d rather than mere \u201c(courses\nof) ideas\u201d, such that \u201cthe ego as the subject of the drive\n[\u2026] is awakened\u201d (transcr. A VII 13, p. 20, cited after\nYamaguchi 1982, p. 57). If the subject then acquires an according\naffective \u201chabituality\u201d, then a new level of\n\u201csecondary passivity\u201d has been constituted (cf. Yamaguchi\n1982, p. 56). For example, the above-mentioned colored dot is then\nready to be perceived as located, at \u2018this current moment\u2019\nof (internal) time, at \u2018that position\u2019 in \u2018my\nown\u2019 (egocentric) perceptual field; it \u201caffects\u201d the\nsubject accordingly, thus serving as a visual stimulus. This\nperceptual field is regarded as \u2018my own\u2019 and \u2018my\ncurrent\u2019 one in virtue of its pre-constitution in pre-reflective\nself-awareness, in which both the subject\u2019s stream of\nconsciousness and its living body (as it would appear in the\n\u201csphere of ownness\u201d, i.e. independently of intersubjective\nexperience) constitute themselves, notably by both internal\ntime-consciousness (see Sections 4 and 6 above; cf. Held 1966) and the\ninstinctive \u201coriginary kinestheses\u201d (Husserliana,\nvol. XV, p. 385) or \u201ckinesthetic syntheses\u201d associated\nwith the bodily movements involved in perception (cf. Landgrebe 1982b,\npp. 81 ff; also cf. Dodd 1997 for a further analysis of\nHusserl\u2019s phenomenology of the body, taking into account the\nrich material to be found in Ideas II, but also in Thing\nand Space and the 5th of the Cartesian\nMeditations; and Taipale 2014, stressing the importance of the\nliving body for the different levels of constitution in Husserl; more\nrecent literature on embodiment in Husserl, covering topics like the\nconstitution of the ego\u2019s own living body and the living bodies of\nothers, also includes Behnke 1996; Hein\u00e4maa 2011, 2018; Moran and\nJanssen, eds., 2018; Carr 2019; and Jardine 2022, ch. 5f).\n\nOn (one reading of) Husserl\u2019s view, these very basic levels or\nstrata underlying self- and world-constitution are still\n\u201canonymous\u201d, i.e. not available through\n(self-)\u201creflection\u201d (cf. Landgrebe 1982b, p. 76), but only\nthrough the \u201cgenetic-phenomenological\u201d method of\n\u201cdeconstruction\u201d or \u201cdismantling\n(Abbau)\u201d. Dismantling starts from a given noematic\nsense, like \u2018this coloured dot\u2019, and tells a story about\nhow (the intentionality correlated with) this sense could have come\nabout, to which kinds of \u201csubjective sources\u201d or origins\nit implicitly refers back (as their \u201csedimentation\u201d),\ngiven the transcendental conditions for the possibility of the\ncorresponding forms of intentionality (cf. Husserl 1939, p. 47). This\ndismantling leads back to the associative \u201coriginary\npairing\u201d of \u2018my own\u2019, originarily-kinesthetic\npre-constituted living body, on the one hand, and a foreign one\naffecting \u2018my own\u2019, on the other, due to similarities\nwhich passively drive the \u201cfirst \u2018ego\u2019 of the\nreduction\u201d (Husserliana, vol. XV, p. 586) to\nco-constitute \u2018my own\u2019 and the \u2018other\u2019 bodily\nego by accordingly motivated \u201capperceptive transfer\u201d\n(Husserliana, vol. I, 140) of the pre-constituted sense\n\u2018this living body of mine\u2019 to the similarly behaving body\n\u2018over there\u2019 (cf. A. D. Smith 2003, pp. 224\u2013251).\nThis co-constitution forms the basis of, first, the co-constitution of\nthe alter ego as a personal human being and (on this basis; cf.\nHusserliana, vol. XIV, p. 418) myself as the same kind of\nbeing and, secondly, the constitution objective reality. The (analysis\nof the) constitution of the latter is sketched in Section 10 below.\nHusserl supposes that its passive pre-constitution\n\u201c\u2018instinctively\u2019 predeliniates the constitution of\nthe whole world for me\u201d, a teleological \u201cfacticity\u201d\nperhaps deriving from \u201cGod\u201d (Husserliana, vol.\nXV, p. 385; see Held 2010).
