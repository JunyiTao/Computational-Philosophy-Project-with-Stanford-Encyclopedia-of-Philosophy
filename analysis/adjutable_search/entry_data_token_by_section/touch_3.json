    "main_text": "Tangible Qualities\n4. Tangible Qualities\nAny discussion of a perceptual modality often turns to the nature\nof the perceptual qualities or features made available by that\nmodality. A discussion of vision, for instance, naturally leads to\nmetaphysical questions about the nature of the colors. A discussion of\naudition similarly would bring up questions about the nature of\nsounds. Touch is unique in this respect, however, since there has been\nlittle philosophical investigation of the nature of tangible\nqualities.\nOne exception, already noted above, concerns the thermal qualities\nof hot and cold. But even here, little attention has been paid to the\nmetaphysical nature of these qualities. This is understandable, given\nthat touch seems to bring us into contact with ordinary material\nobjects and their properties. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any\nserious worries about the nature of solidity, texture, vibration, and\nthe like. There is an important question about the structure of felt\ntangible qualities, however. How are these ordinary tangible features\nrepresented or experienced?\n One possibility is that, ultimately, all of the tangible\nqualities, with the exception of hot and cold, can be reduced to the\nspatial properties of objects (Armstrong 1962). Such a view could be \nconnected to recent work on the spatial content of touch (for instance, \nviews like those explored in Fardo et al 2018). Defending such a\nreductive claim involves making an important distinction\nbetween transitive and intransitive bodily\nsensation. The transitive sensations are those like warmth and\npressure that have a sensory component as well as a real world\nproperty. Intransitive sensations do not have any\nnon\u2013sensational real world feature. This is one way to separate\nout pains, twitches, and tingles from perceptual touch proper. The\nspatial view then states that nearly all of the objective tangible\nfeatures made available through transitive sensation are relational\nspatial properties. On this relational view of touch, all immediate\ntactual perception involves a relation holding between our body and\nobjects in contact with it. A rough surface is one that is solid, has\nhardness, and a certain uneven shape. A smooth surface only differs in\nhaving a regular shape. Roughness and smoothness can be analyzed in\nterms of shape. A hard object is one that does not change its shape. A\nsoft object changes its shape under pressure. Liquidity is defined as\nhaving a particular shape in particular circumstances. Pressure plays\na role here, so the view also requires a spatial account of\npressure. One possibility is that pressure is a quality that has a\ntendency to cause a change in the shape of the body. Stickyness could\nbe when something remains in contact with the same spot on the skin,\nslippery things do not. Despite the possibilities for reduction here,\nmany of these moves feel ad hoc and unsupported by the empirical\nevidence. A better account is needed.\nA more recent view holds that tangible qualities are best\nunderstood as intensive features that vary in intensity along\na single dimension of variation (Fulkerson 2014b). When we feel\nvibration, for instance, it seems to increase in intensity (in this\ncase, in frequency) along a single qualitative dimension. This seems\nto be true of most tangible features. They are not typically complex,\nbut simples that vary along a single dimension. This view accords well\nwith the empirical data and offers a unified explanation for the\nstructural connections between an otherwise disjoint collection of\nsensory features. One worry for this view, however, again concerns our\nawareness of hot and cold. Variations in intensity alone do not seem\napt for capturing the nature of hot and cold experiences (see\nbelow). Rather than varying along a single dimension, our experiences\nof hot and cold seem to vary in intensity in two directions around a\nneutral point (Gray 2012). Cold experiences are those that vary away\nfrom neutral in one direction; our experiences of warmth vary away\nfrom neutral in the other (increasing) direction. More importantly, it\nseems the nature of these movements depends more on changes in our\ncurrent bodily state than the objective measures of temperature. So\nonce again, thermal properties seem to pose additional difficulties\nnot faced by other tangible qualities.\n",
