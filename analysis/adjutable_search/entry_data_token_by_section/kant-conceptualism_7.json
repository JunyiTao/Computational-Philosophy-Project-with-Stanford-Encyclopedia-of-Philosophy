    "main_text": "Frame II: Dependence on the Intellect || Intellectualism & Sensibilism\n4.1 Intellectualism & Sensibilism\n\nThe alternative frame distinguishes two broad camps, each of which\nconstrues these dependence conditions differently (see McLear 2015,\n2016a; Gomes 2017a). On the one side is \u201cIntellectualism\u201d\n(see, e.g., McDowell 1996; Longuenesse 1998; Gr\u00fcne 2009; Friedman\n2015; Conant 2016; Indregard forthcoming) and on the other is\n\u201cNonintellectualism\u201d or \u201cSensibilism\u201d (Rohs\n2001; Hanna 2005; McLear 2015; Allais 2015: 148ff, 2017a; Tolley\n2019).\n\nIntellectualism: the generation of intuition is at\nleast partly dependent on the intellect.\n\nSensibilism: at least some intuitions are generated\nindependently of the intellect itself\n\nAccording to Sensibilism at least some objective sensory states,\nincluding the \u201cpure\u201d representations of space and time,\npossess structure which is not the product of the activity of the\n\u201cintellect\u201d so construed, and so do not depend for their\nstructure or unity on the pure apperceptive power or downstream\nmanifestations of that power in conceptualization, judgment, or\ninference.\n\nHere, as above, \u201cintellect\u201d is understood as the generic\nterm for the \u201chigher\u201d cognitive faculties which include\nunderstanding, judgment, and reason. Kant often characterizes these\nfaculties as \u201cspontaneous\u201d or essentially\n\u201cactive\u201d, in contrast to the \u201creceptive\u201d or\nessentially \u201cpassive\u201d character of sensibility (e.g.,\nA50-1/B74-5). How exactly these distinctions should be understood is\ncontroversial. Part of the problem comes in determining how to\nconstrue activity of the mind that is not overtly\n\u201cconceptual\u201d, in the sense that it does not consist in\napplication of concepts in judgment, but nevertheless still involves a\nrule-governed synthesis, or is otherwise dependent on a spontaneous\npower for combining representations that is not present in sensibility\n(B129\u201330). There does not yet seem to be a settled consensus on\nthis point.\n\nHowever, one potential means of explaining what \u201cdependence on\nthe intellect\u201d comes to is dependence on the power of (pure)\napperception. Kant consistently characterizes the power of\napperception and the unity it brings about as the\n\u201coriginal\u201d or unconditioned condition of all employment of\nconcepts, including the categories (B131, B133-4n, A401-2). Indeed,\nKant explicitly states that \u201cthe possibility of the logical form\nof all cognition necessarily rests on the relationship to this\napperception as a faculty\u201d (A117n) and that even the\n\u201cpossibility of the understanding itself\u201d rests on the\npure unity of consciousness made possible by the power of apperception\n(B137; see also Metaphysik Mrongovius 29:889\n(1782\u20131783)).\n\nKant does occasionally say that the actualization of the apperceptive\npower, in the synthetic unity of understanding, depends on the use of\nthe categories (e.g., B145-6). This might make Kant\u2019s account\nseem circular, with the understanding depending on apperception which\nin turn depends on the understanding, as the faculty of synthesis. But\nKant can hold that while the power or faculty of pure apperception is\ndistinct from any of its actualizations, when it is so actualized it\nentails a synthetic combination via the categories (B143, B144). Thus\nthe fact that apperception does not occur without the categorial\nsynthesis doesn\u2019t mean that apperception is grounded in such\nsynthesis. This way Kant can both say that the understanding is made\npossible by the power of apperception, and that apperception (as\nactualized unity) depends on\u2014in the sense that it cannot\nactualize without\u2014conceptual/categorial synthesis.\n\nThis dependence of the understanding (and hence the logical form of\nall cognition) on the power of apperception contrasts with the\nreceptive faculty of sensibility, whose activities, at least in their\ngeneric conception, are not defined as depending on the existence of\nan apperceptive power capable of bringing about such a unity of\nconsciousness. Thus to say that the generation of intuition is at\nleast partially dependent on the intellect is, on the current\nproposal, to say one of two things. Either, that the intuition depends\non the exercise of the power or capacity for apperception itself, or\nthat intuition depends on the exercise of one or more capacities whose\npossibility rests on the pure power of apperception. This allows for\nsignificant flexibility in the way in which the Intellectualist might\nexpress their position, while still providing unity to the overall\napproach.\n\nAccording to this framing, Sensibilism and Intellectualism can agree\nthat sensing and thinking involve distinct (and distinctive) cognitive\nabilities. In this regard, Sensibilism is not to be confused with a\ncrude empiricism. Moreover, both Sensibilism and Intellectualism\nexplain the generation and structure of representations or mental\nstates at least partly in terms of the relevant cognitive capacity or\nfaculty. The key difference is that Intellectualism construes the\nstructure and generation of intuitive representations as dependent not\nonly on sensibility but also on some intellectual capacity. For the\nIntellectualist, the only representations which do not admit of this\ndependence are the simple sensations that are the supposed initial\nproduct of sensibility (e.g., the sensations of \u201csheer\nreceptivity\u201d in Sellars 1968: ch. 1).\n",
