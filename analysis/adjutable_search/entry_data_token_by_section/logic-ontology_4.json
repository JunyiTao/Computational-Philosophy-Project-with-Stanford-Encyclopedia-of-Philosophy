    "main_text": "Ontology || Different conceptions of ontology\n3.1 Different conceptions of ontology\n\nAs a first approximation, ontology is the study of what there is. Some\ncontest this formulation of what ontology is, so it\u2019s only a\nfirst approximation. Many classical philosophical problems are\nproblems in ontology: the question whether or not there is a god, or\nthe problem of the existence of universals, etc.. These are all\nproblems in ontology in the sense that they deal with whether or not a\ncertain thing, or more broadly entity, exists. But ontology is usually\nalso taken to encompass problems about the most general features and\nrelations of the entities which do exist. There are also a number of\nclassic philosophical problems that are problems in ontology\nunderstood in this way. For example, the problem of how a universal\nrelates to a particular that has it (assuming there are universals and\nparticulars), or the problem of how an event like John eating a cookie\nrelates to the particulars John and the cookie, and the relation of\neating, assuming there are events, particulars and relations. These\nkinds of problems quickly turn into metaphysics more generally, which\nis the philosophical discipline that encompasses ontology as one of\nits parts. The borders here are a little fuzzy. But we have at least\ntwo parts to the overall philosophical project of ontology, on our\npreliminary understanding of it: first, say what there is, what\nexists, what the stuff of reality is made out of, secondly, say what\nthe most general features and relations of these things are.\n\nThis way of looking at ontology comes with two sets of problems which\nleads to the philosophical discipline of ontology being more complex\nthan just answering the above questions. The first set of problems is\nthat it isn\u2019t clear how to approach answering these questions.\nThis leads to the debate about ontological commitment. The second set\nof problems is that it isn\u2019t so clear what these questions\nreally are. This leads to the philosophical debate about\nmeta-ontology. Let's look at them in turn.\n\nOne of the troubles with ontology is that it not only isn\u2019t\nclear what there is, it also isn\u2019t so clear how to settle\nquestions about what there is, at least not for the kinds of things\nthat have traditionally been of special interest to philosophers:\nnumbers, properties, God, etc. Ontology is thus a philosophical\ndiscipline that encompasses besides the study of what there is and the\nstudy of the general features of what there is also the study of what\nis involved in settling questions about what there is in general,\nespecially for the philosophically tricky cases. How we can find out\nwhat there is isn\u2019t an easy question to answer. It might seem\nsimple enough for regular objects that we can perceive with our eyes,\nlike my house keys, but how should we decide it for such things as,\nsay, numbers or properties? One first step to making progress on this\nquestion is to see if what we believe already rationally settles this\nquestion. That is to say, given that we have certain beliefs, do these\nbeliefs already bring with them a rational commitment to an answer to\nsuch questions as \u2018Are there numbers?\u2019 If our beliefs\nbring with them a rational commitment to an answer to an ontological\nquestion about the existence of certain entities then we can say that\nwe are committed to the existence of these entities. What precisely is\nrequired for such a commitment to occur is subject to debate, a debate\nwe will look at momentarily. To find out what one is committed to with\na particular set of beliefs, or acceptance of a particular theory of\nthe world, is part of the larger discipline of ontology.\n\nBesides it not being so clear what it is to commit yourself to an\nanswer to an ontological question, it also isn\u2019t so clear what\nan ontological question really is, and thus what it is that ontology\nis supposed to accomplish. To figure this out is the task of\nmeta-ontology, which strictly speaking is not part of ontology\nconstrued narrowly, but the study of what ontology is. However, like\nmost philosophical disciplines, ontology more broadly construed\ncontains its own meta-study, and thus meta-ontology is part of\nontology, more broadly construed. Nonetheless it is helpful to\nseparate it out as a special part of ontology. Many of the\nphilosophically most fundamental questions about ontology really are\nmeta-ontological questions. Meta-ontology has not been too popular in\nthe latter parts of the 20th century, partly because one\nmeta-ontological view, the one often associated with Quine, had been\nwidely accepted as the correct one, but this acceptance has been\nchallenged in recent years in a variety of ways. One motivation for\nthe study of meta-ontology is simply the question of what question\nontology aims to answer. Take the case of numbers, for example. What\nis the question that we should aim to answer in ontology if we want to\nfind out if there are numbers, that is, if reality contains numbers\nbesides whatever else it is made up from? This way of putting it\nsuggest an easy answer: \u2018Are there numbers?\u2019 But this\nquestion seems like an easy one to answer. An answer to it is implied,\nit seems, by trivial mathematics, say that the number 7 is less than\nthe number 8. If the latter, then there is a number which is less than\n8, namely 7, and thus there is at least one number. Can ontology be\nthat easy? The study of meta-ontology will have to determine, amongst\nothers, if \u2018Are there numbers?\u2019 really is the question\nthat the discipline of ontology is supposed to answer, and more\ngenerally, what ontology is supposed to do. We will pursue these\nquestions further below. As we will see, several philosophers think\nthat ontology is supposed to answer a different question than what\nthere is, but they often disagree on what that question is.\n\nThe larger discipline of ontology can thus be seen as having four\nparts:\n\n(O1)\n the study of ontological commitment, i.e. what we or others are\ncommitted to,\n(O2)\n the study of what there is,\n(O3)\n the study of the most general features of what there is, and how\nthe things there are relate to each other in the metaphysically most\ngeneral ways,\n(O4)\n the study of meta-ontology, i.e. saying what task it is that the\ndiscipline of ontology should aim to accomplish, if any, how the\nquestions it aims to answer should be understood, and with what\nmethodology they can be answered.\n\n",
