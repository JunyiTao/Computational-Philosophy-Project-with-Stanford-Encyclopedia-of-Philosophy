    "main_text": "Nirvikalpaka and Savikalpaka Pratyak\u1e63a || The Advaita Ved\u0101nta: a compromise on Hindu realism\n3.5 The Advaita Ved\u0101nta: a compromise on Hindu realism\n\nThe Advaita Ved\u0101nta theory compromises on the realism of earlier\nclassical Hindu philosophy. Their early view on perception is akin to\nthe Buddhists, although arrived at from a different perspective.\nMa\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra says:\n\nPerception is first, without mental construction, and has for its\nobject the bare thing. The constructive cognitions which follow it\nplunge into particulars. (Brahma-Siddhi, 71.1-2)\n\n\nHe draws a distinction between perceptual cognition and constructive\ncognition, but is careful to use vikalpa-buddhi, rather than\nsavikalpaka pratyak\u1e63a, for the latter cognition. For\nhim perception is always non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka)\nperception and it is of a universal, indeed of the highest universal,\nBeing (sat). According to early Ved\u0101ntins, the real is\nbereft of all character since its nature is non-differentiated\nconsciousness or Brahman. Therefore, perceptual cognition, which\npresents the real, must be non-conceptual or indeterminate for it is\nthe knowledge of the existence of a thing without any qualifications\nor predications. Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra also denies the thesis\nthat non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception is non-verbal.\nThis surprising claim is clearly owed to Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s\ninfluence, as is evidenced by the example used by Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana\nMi\u015bra in the argument. Confronted by an opponent with the claim\nthat verbal knowledge involves duality and relation, and therefore\nmust involve concepts, Ma\u1e47\u1e0dana Mi\u015bra replies that\nverbal knowledge is not necessarily relational: a baby\u2019s\nnon-verbal knowledge of its mother\u2019s breast, grasps it merely as\n\u2018this\u2019 (of course we do not assume that the baby\narticulates the word \u2018this\u2019; the word, as in\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s account, has a more subtle form in the\nbaby\u2019s mind) and, therefore, the highest knowledge of the\nUltimate reality (Brahman) in which there is no duality, no\nrelations, no concepts, may still be verbal.\n\nNeo Advaita-Ved\u0101ntins, however, accept a distinction between\nnon-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception and conceptual\n(nirvikalpaka) perceptions from empirical or practical\n(vy\u0101vah\u0101rika) standpoint; from ultimate\n(param\u0101rthika) standpoint such distinction is untenable.\nA brief description of conceptual (vi\u1e63ayagata,\nAdvaita-Ved\u0101nta term for savikalpaka) perception will\nhelp put in perspective Applebaum\u2019s (1982) reconstruction of\ntheir notion of non-conceptual (nirvikalpaka) perception\nlater. Determinate perception is the result of the activity of mind\n(manas) or anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a (literally\ntranslated as \u2018inner vehicle\u2019)\u2014the terms are\nfrequently used interchangeably. Advaitins maintain that the mind\n(anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a) \u2018goes out\u2019 through the\nrespective sense organ (the eye, say) and pervades the object of\nattention. As a result of this contact, the object presents itself as\ndata to the receptive mind (anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a) which,\nin turn, transforms into mental state (v\u1e5btti)\n(Bilimoria, 1980, 38). As soon as the data are presented to inner\nfaculty, there is an identification of consciousness associated with\nthe mental state (anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a-v\u1e5btti) with\nthe consciousness associated with the object. To say that v\u1e5btti\nand data are identified is to say that the form of the mental state,\nif all goes well, corresponds one-to-one with the form of the object;\nthe mental state is a reflection of the object of perception, and as\nsuch is non-different from the object. Thus results a determinate\njudgment (v\u1e5bttij\u00f1\u0101na) of the form\n\u201cthis is a jar\u201d. Furthermore, according to them, we do not\nperceive our mental states; we directly perceive the objects\nthemselves. Bilimora explains,\n\nThe v\u1e5btti in the form of the object impresses itself as\nit were in the mode of the subject itself, and thereby comes to be\napprehended, but as a predicate\u2014and not as the pure\nsubject-content which is the \u2018I-notion\u2019\u2014in the\nsubject\u2019s apperception. (Bilimoria, 1980, 41)\n\n\nThe initial mental state subsides and the subject becomes directly\naware of the object itself; the cognition is self-evident to the\nsubject, just like the cognition of pleasure and pain. In this\nreflective stage, the mind (anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a)\nintegrates the mental contents corresponding to the object with\nfamiliar or recognized percepts. Determinate perception of the\ntotality of the object occurs with the completion of the assimilative\nprocess.\n\nDavid Applebaum (1982) notes that Bilimoria\u2019s discussion of the\nAdvaitin\u2019s notion of perception focuses on the necessary\nconditions or criteria for valid or veridical perceptions. According\nto him, this approach while justified in the light of\nperception\u2019s inclusion among the means of knowledge\n(pram\u0101\u1e47a-s) is mistaken because it only focuses on\nsensation as a species of mental state (v\u1e5btti). For the\nAdvaitin, sensation is not a mode exhausted by the judgmental content\nof a mental state (v\u1e5btti), it has epistemic value\nindependently of its role in judgmental perception. Applebaum quotes\nfrom the Upanisadic texts to support this view:\n\nManas is for men a means of bondage or liberation \u2026 of\nbondage if it clings to objects of perception (visayasangi),\nand of liberation if not directed towards these objects\n(nirvi\u1e63ayam). (Applebaum, 1982, 203)\n\n\nNon-conceptual perception furnishes us with knowledge of pure\nexistence (sanm\u0101tra) rather than with protodata to\nconstruct imagined particulars. Therefore, it is not simply a prior\nstage of conceptual perception and so also not necessarily a mental\nstate produced in cooperation with the object. Applebaum (1982, 204)\nsuggests that non-conceptual perception in this sense focuses\nattention on sensing, in which consciousness turns its attention\ninwards to the activity of the sense-organs resulting in deepening and\nbroadening their proprioceptive content. Proprioception, he claims,\npoints the way to the soul or self (\u0101tman); mind\n(anta\u1e25kara\u1e47a) returns to its presentational\nactivity, its function of monitoring and unfolding the sensory\nmanifold to create conditions for the emergence of self\n(\u0101tman), which according to the Advaitin, is identical\nwith the Ultimate reality (Brahman). In non-conceptual\n(nirvikalpaka) perception, consciousness is returned to\nitself and opens up the possibility of manifesting or seeing the\nSeer (\u0101tman) or knowing the Ultimate reality\n(Brahman).\n",
