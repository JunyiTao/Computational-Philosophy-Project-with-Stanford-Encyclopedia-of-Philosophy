Contributory Dispositions and Abilities\n\nBy definition, a person who does something voluntarily is both willing\nand able to do that thing at that time. Both the willingness and the\nability contribute causally to the person\u2019s action, in the sense\nthat the voluntary action would not occur if either (or both) of these\nwere lacking. For example, suppose that one is standing with\none\u2019s arms at one\u2019s sides and one voluntarily lifts\none\u2019s right arm to an extended horizontal position. One would\nnot do so if one were unable to lift one\u2019s arm, if for example\none\u2019s right side was paralyzed as the result of a stroke. Nor\nwould one do so if one were unwilling to lift one\u2019s arm, if for\nexample one were participating in a street demonstration at which a\nwhite supremacist was urging the crowd to lift their right arm in a\nNazi salute and one were unwilling to express support in this way for\nthe racist Nazi ideology. The same analysis applies to a voluntary\nmental process of thinking critically. It requires both willingness\nand ability to think critically, including willingness and ability to\nperform each of the mental acts that compose the process and to\ncoordinate those acts in a sequence that is directed at resolving the\ninitiating perplexity.\n\nConsider willingness first. We can identify causal contributors to\nwillingness to think critically by considering factors that would\ncause a person who was able to think critically about an issue\nnevertheless not to do so (Hamby 2014). For each factor, the opposite\ncondition thus contributes causally to willingness to think critically\non a particular occasion. For example, people who habitually jump to\nconclusions without considering alternatives will not think critically\nabout issues that arise, even if they have the required abilities. The\ncontrary condition of willingness to suspend judgment is thus a causal\ncontributor to thinking critically.\n\nNow consider ability. In contrast to the ability to move one\u2019s\narm, which can be completely absent because a stroke has left the arm\nparalyzed, the ability to think critically is a developed ability,\nwhose absence is not a complete absence of ability to think but\nabsence of ability to think well. We can identify the ability to think\nwell directly, in terms of the norms and standards for good thinking.\nIn general, to be able do well the thinking activities that can be\ncomponents of a critical thinking process, one needs to know the\nconcepts and principles that characterize their good performance, to\nrecognize in particular cases that the concepts and principles apply,\nand to apply them. The knowledge, recognition and application may be\nprocedural rather than declarative. It may be domain-specific rather\nthan widely applicable, and in either case may need subject-matter\nknowledge, sometimes of a deep kind.\n\nReflections of the sort illustrated by the previous two paragraphs\nhave led scholars to identify the knowledge, abilities and\ndispositions of a \u201ccritical thinker\u201d, i.e., someone who\nthinks critically whenever it is appropriate to do so. We turn now to\nthese three types of causal contributors to thinking critically. We\nstart with dispositions, since arguably these are the most powerful\ncontributors to being a critical thinker, can be fostered at an early\nstage of a child\u2019s development, and are susceptible to general\nimprovement (Glaser 1941: 175)\n",
