    "main_text": "Philosophical Principles || Flux\n3.1 Flux\n\nBarnes bases his Platonic reading on Plato\u2019s own statement:\n\nHeraclitus, I believe, says that all things pass and nothing stays,\nand comparing existing things to the flow of a river, he says you\ncould not step twice into the same river. (Plato Cratylus\n402a = A6)\n\n\nThe established scholarly method is to try to verify Plato\u2019s\ninterpretation by looking at Heraclitus\u2019 own words, if possible.\nThere are three alleged \u201criver fragments\u201d:\n\n\nB12. potamoisi toisin autoisin embainousin hetera kai hetera\nhudata epirrei.\n\nOn those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters\nflow. (Cleanthes from Arius Didymus from Eusebius)\n\n\nB49a. potamois tois autois \u2026 \n\nInto the same rivers we step and do not step, we are and are not.\n(Heraclitus Homericus)\n\n\nB91[a]. potam\u00f4i \u2026 t\u00f4i aut\u00f4i\n\u2026\n\nIt is not possible to step twice into the same river according to\nHeraclitus, or to come into contact twice with a mortal being in the\nsame state. (Plutarch)\n\n\n\nOf these only the first has the linguistic density characteristic of\nHeraclitus\u2019 words. The second starts out with the same three\nwords as B12, but in Attic, not in Heraclitus\u2019 Ionic dialect,\nand the second clause has no grammatical connection to the first. The\nthird is patently a paraphrase by an author famous for quoting from\nmemory rather than from books. Even it starts out in Greek with the\nword \u2018river,\u2019 but in the singular. There is no evidence\nthat repetitions of phrases with variations are part of\nHeraclitus\u2019 style (as they are of Empedocles\u2019). To start\nwith the word \u2018river(s)\u2019 goes against normal Greek prose\nstyle, and on the plausible assumption that all sources are trying to\nimitate Heraclitus, who does not repeat himself, we would be led to\nchoose B12 as the one and only river fragment, the only actual\nquotation from Heraclitus\u2019 book. This is the conclusion of Kirk\n(1954) and Marcovich (1967), based on an interpretation that goes back\nto Reinhardt (1916). That B12 is genuine is suggested by the features\nit shares with Heraclitean fragments: syntactic ambiguity (toisin\nautoisin \u2018the same\u2019 [in the dative] can be construed\neither with \u2018rivers\u2019 [\u201cthe same rivers\u201d] or\nwith \u2018those stepping in\u2019 [\u201cthe same people\u201d],\nwith what comes before or after), chiasmus, sound-painting (the first\nphrase creates the sound of rushing water with its diphthongs and\nsibilants), rhyme and\n alliteration.[2]\n\nIf B12 is accepted as genuine, it tends to disqualify the other two\nalleged fragments. The major theoretical connection in the fragment is\nthat between \u2018same rivers\u2019 and \u2018other waters.\u2019\nB12 is, among other things, a statement of the coincidence of\nopposites. But it specifies the rivers as the same. The statement is,\non the surface, paradoxical, but there is no reason to take it as\nfalse or contradictory. It makes perfectly good sense: we call a body\nof water a river precisely because it consists of changing waters; if\nthe waters should cease to flow it would not be a river, but a lake or\na dry streambed. There is a sense, then, in which a river is a\nremarkable kind of existent, one that remains what it is by changing\nwhat it contains (cf. Hume Treatise 1.4.6, p. 258\nSelby-Bigge). Heraclitus derives a striking insight from an everyday\nencounter. Further, he supplies, via the ambiguity in the first\nclause, another reading: on the same people stepping into rivers,\nother and other waters flow. With this reading it is people who remain\nthe same in contrast to changing waters, as if the encounter with a\nflowing environment helped to constitute the perceiving subject as the\nsame. (See Kahn 1979.) B49a, by contrast, contradicts the claim that\none can step into the same rivers (and also asserts that claim), and\nB91[a], like Plato in the Cratylus, denies that one can step\nin twice. Yet if the rivers remain the same, one surely can step in\ntwice\u2013not into the same waters, to be sure, but into the same\nrivers. Thus the other alleged fragments are incompatible with the one\ncertifiably genuine fragment.\n\nIn fact, Marcovich (1967) has succeeded in showing how a misreading of\nB12 could lead to an interpretation such as that embodied in A6 and\nB91[a]. It is possible to see Cratylus, a late follower of Heraclitus,\nsupplying the wayward reading, and then adding his famous rejoinder\nthat one cannot step into the same river even once (although the\nreading may go back earlier to Hippias: Mansfeld 1990: 43\u201355).\nSince Plato is alleged to have heard Cratylus\u2019 lectures, he may\nwell have derived his reading from Cratylus\u2019 criticism. \n\nIf this interpretation is right, the message of the one river\nfragment, B12, is not that all things are changing so that we cannot\nencounter them twice, but something much more subtle and profound. It\nis that some things stay the same only by changing. One kind of\nlong-lasting material reality exists by virtue of constant turnover in\nits constituent matter. Here constancy and change are not opposed but\ninextricably connected. A human body could be understood in precisely\nthe same way, as living and continuing by virtue of constant\nmetabolism\u2013as Aristotle for instance later understood it. On\nthis reading, Heraclitus believes in flux, but not as destructive of\nconstancy; rather it is, paradoxically, a necessary condition of\nconstancy, at least in some cases (and arguably in all). In general,\nat least in some exemplary cases, high-level structures supervene on\nlow-level material flux. The Platonic reading still has advocates\n(e.g. Tar\u00e1n 1999), but it is no longer the only reading of\nHeraclitus advocated by scholars.\n",
