    "main_text": "Epistemology and philosophy of sciences || Realism\n4.1 Realism\n\nRealism is a constant and integral part of Kepler\u2019s thought, and\none which appears in sophisticated form from the outset. The reason\nfor this is that his realism always runs parallel to his defense of\nthe Copernican worldview, which appeared from his first public\npronouncements and publications.\n\nMany of Kepler\u2019s thoughts about epistemology can be found in his\nDefense of Tycho against Ursus or Contra Ursum\n(=CU), a work which emerged from a polemical framework, the plagiarism\nconflict between Nicolaus Raimarus Ursus (1551\u20131600) and Tycho\nBrahe: causality and physicalization of astronomical theories, the\nconcept and status of astronomical hypotheses, the polemic\n\u201crealism-instrumentalism\u201d, his criticism of skepticism in\ngeneral, the epistemological role of history, etc. It is one of the\nmost significant works ever written on this subject and is sometimes\ncompared with Bacon\u2019s Novum organum and\nDescartes\u2019 Discourse on Method (Jardine 1988, p. 5; for\nan excellent new edition and complete study of this work see Jardine /\nSegonds 2008).\n\nThe focus of the epistemological issues could be ranked mutatis\nmutandi with modern discussion surrounding the scientific status\nof astronomical theories (however, as Jardine has pointed out, it\nwould be sounder to read Kepler\u2019s CU more as a work against\nskepticism than in the context of the modern realism/instrumentalism\npolemic). For Pierre Duhem (1861\u20131916), for instance, the\nposition of Andreas Osiander, which was adopted by Ursus and which\nwas, according to Duhem, naively criticized by Kepler in his MC,\nrepresents the modern approach known as \u201cinstrumentalism\u201d.\nAccording to this epistemological position, held by Duhem himself,\nscientific theories are not to be closely linked to the concepts of\ntruth and falsehood. Hypotheses and scientific laws are nothing more\nthan \u201cinstruments\u201d for describing and predicting phenomena\n(seldom for explaining them). The aim of physical theories is not to\noffer a causal explanation or to study the causes of phenomena, but\nsimply to represent them. In the best-case scenario, theories are able\nto order and classify what is decisive for their predictive capacity\n(Duhem 1908, 1914).\n\nContrary to Tycho and Kepler, Ursus held a fictionalist position in\nastronomy. Yet in the very beginning of his work De\nhypothesibus, Ursus makes a clear declaration about the nature of\nastronomical theories, which is very similar to the approach suggested\nby Osiander in his forward to Copernicus\u2019 De\nrevolutionibus: a hypothesis is a \u201cfictitious\nsupposition\u201d, introduced just for the sake of \u201csaving the\nmotions of the heavenly bodies\u201d and to \u201ccalculate\nthem\u201d (trans. Jardine 1988, p. 41)\n\nFollowing his approach in MC and anticipating the opening pages of his\nlater AN (see particularly AN, II.21: \u201cWhy, and to what extent,\nmay a false hypothesis yield the truth?\u201d Engl. trans., pp.\n294\u2013301), Kepler addresses the question of Copernicanism and its\nreception by thinkers such as Osiander, who emphasized that the truth\nof astronomical hypotheses cannot necessarily be deduced from the\ncorrect prediction of astronomical facts. According to this\ninterpretation, Copernican hypotheses are not necessarily true even if\nthey are able to save the phenomena, otherwise one would commit a\nfallacia affirmationis consequentis. However, according to\nKepler, \u201cthis happens only by chance and not always, but only\nwhen the error in the one proposition meets another proposition,\nwhether true or false, appropriate for eliciting the truth\u201d\n(trans. Jardine, p. 140). To be noted is that, as Jardine (2005, p.\n137) has pointed out, the modern scientific realist departs from a\nreal independent world, while Kepler\u2019s notion of truth\npresupposes that neither nature nor the human mind are independent of\nGod\u2019s mind (Jardine 2005, p. 137).\n",
