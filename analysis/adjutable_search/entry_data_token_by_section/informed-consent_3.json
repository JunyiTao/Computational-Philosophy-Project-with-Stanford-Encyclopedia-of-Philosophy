    "main_text": "Why informed consent? || Autonomy\n2.2 Autonomy\n\nThe 1970s saw the ascent of a second rationale,\n autonomy,\n as the predominant justification of informed consent, through\ninfluential work by Ruth Faden, Tom Beauchamp, James Childress, and a\nU.S. President\u2019s Commission (Faden and Beauchamp 1986, 8;\nNational Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical\nand Behavioral Research 1979, section b (1), 282\u20133; Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, ch. 4; Beauchamp 2010; see also President\u2019s\nCommission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and\nBiomedical and Behavioral Research 1982, 27; Feinberg 1986; Dworkin\n1988, 111, 113; Buchanan and Brock 1989, 36ff.; Brock 1994,\n31\u20132).\n\nPhilosophers of action usually understand autonomy as governance over\none\u2019s own agency\u2014acting according to a law that one sets\nfor oneself. Likewise, for bioethicists Beauchamp and Childress,\n\u201cThe autonomous individual acts freely in accordance with a\nself-chosen plan, analogous to the way an independent government\nmanages its territories and establishes its policies\u201d (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, 99\u2013100). As the authors emphasize (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, 100\u20131), autonomy so understood differs from\nautonomy as having the will that one wants to have (Frankfurt 1988).\nIt also differs from many other uses of \u201cautonomy\u201d in\nbioethics and biolaw (Dworkin 1988, 101ff.)\u2014so many as to prompt\nsome to question the force of autonomy-based justifications\n(O\u2019Neill 2003). However, initially, autonomy seems like a\npromising ground for informed consent requirements. The rationale for\nnot transfusing a protesting, decisionally-capacitated Jehovah\u2019s\nWitness even when forced transfusion would save the witness\u2019s\nlife is clearly not protection of her health. Instead, it may seem to\ndo with maintaining her self-rule on such momentous issues: a matter\nof respect for an autonomous decision maker\u2019s refusal. And fully\ninformed consent usually assumes freedom from controlling interference\nand from an inadequate understanding of the basic risks of the\nintervention, components of fully autonomous choice as well (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, 100\u20131).\n\nWhile occasionally, the need for autonomous authorization of medical\nintervention is considered \u201caxiomatic\u201d (Beauchamp 2010,\n58), it is commonplace to defend autonomy on independent grounds. A\ncomplete autonomy-based justification for the informed consent\nrequirement would explain both why personal autonomy, under a\nplausible explication, matters\u2014why it has high value or status,\nat least in the health arena; and how honoring the informed consent\nrequirement engages with its value or status correctly.\n\nSome attempt to justify autonomy on merely instrumental grounds,\nsuggesting, for example, that concordance between our care and our\nvalues is often key to our continued satisfaction and cooperation with\nassigned medical teams. Others add that autonomy is inherently good\nfor us. First, self-rule is central to a good life, perhaps because it\nmakes us less self-alienated and more worthy of praise for our\nvirtuous decisions. Second, autonomous choices promote our ultimate\ngoals, on the non-controversial assumption that medicine affects\nnon-technical and controversial matters of value and faith on which\nphysicians are not experts (say, a Jehovah\u2019s Witness\u2019s\nfaith), and the controversial assumption that these goals define how\nwell our lives go (President\u2019s Commission for the Study of\nEthical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research\n1982; Dworkin 1988, 113).\n\nHowever, these links between informed consent, autonomy, and the good\nlife are more tenuous than informed consent requirements are usually\nassumed to be. In the Jehovah\u2019s Witness case, any medical good\nthat might come from promoting the patient\u2019s future cooperation\nwith assigned medical teams is irrelevant once refusal to accept\ntransfusion makes the patient\u2019s future life an impossibility. In\naddition, according to the beliefs of some Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses,\nwhat their religion says is that they must refuse transfusion, not\nthat undergoing forced transfusion would land them in hell or breach\ntheir personal integrity. To impose transfusion on Jehovah\u2019s\nWitnesses of that particular persuasion might not blight their lives,\nyet it remains a clear breach of informed consent requirements.\n\nFully autonomous decision-making seems to be bad for us sometimes in\nat least certain respects, say, when it involves tortuous\ndeliberations, makes us more accountable for embarrassing mistakes, or\ninvites social pressure to make certain choices (Dworkin 1988, ch. 5).\nThe cost of ensuring that a single decision is absolutely autonomous\nmay be a severe, permanent, or fatal health problem. This health\nproblem will usually affect well-being more than a small marginal\ndecrease of autonomy would\u2014yet some informed consent\nrequirements apply. Indeed, on no theory of\n well-being\u2014neither\n desire satisfaction, hedonic state, nor objective list\u2014does it\nseem to follow that either informed consent or autonomous choice\ninvariably makes a patient\u2019s life better (Buchanan and Brock\n1989, ch. 1 \u00a74, esp. p. 40). And if they did, then it would be\nabsurd to claim, as proponents of the autonomy rationale do (Beauchamp\nand Childress 2008, e.g. pp. 12, 14), that informed consent and the\nprinciple of autonomy are distinct from, sometimes conflict with, and\noften supersede, the principle of beneficence.\n\nA different version of the autonomy rationale states, in the spirit of\n Immanuel Kant\u2019s\n ethics, that autonomy should command our awe and reverence, whether\nor not it is good for us (Hill 1991, 43). The literature on informed\nconsent regularly cites Kant\u2019s Formula of Humanity (Kant 1996,\n80 [4:429]) to establish that duties of\n respect\n for autonomy bind physicians (Beauchamp and Childress 2008, 63, 103;\nDworkin 1988, 110; Levine 1988, 96\u20137; Pellegrino and Thomasma\n1993, 128). Alan Donagan\u2019s defense of the requirement of\ninformed consent illustrates this Kantian approach: \u201cRecognition\nof every human being as having a unique dignity as human, and as\ntherefore being an end in every relation in which others may morally\nstand to him, entails that no human being may legitimately be\ninterfered with in pursuing his conception of his happiness in\nwhatever way seems best to him\u201d (Donagan 1977, 31).\n\nThis version of the autonomy rationale is criticizeable as well. Kant\nassociated respect for persons with treating them only in ways that\nthey could possibly or rationally consent to, not with treating them\nin ways that they have actually consented to\u2014rationally,\nvoluntarily, or otherwise (Wertheimer 2014, 149). The notion of\nautonomy as bioethicists understand it hardly resembles Kant\u2019s\nnotion of autonomy (O\u2019Neill 2003). And while some contemporary\nKantians interpret autonomy as \u201cour authority to determine our\nown actions\u201d (Buss 2016), many gross violations of informed\nconsent do not directly transgress that alleged authority. A surgeon\nwho exploits a patient\u2019s surgical anesthesia to force an\nexperimental intervention grossly violates informed consent by\naffecting heavily the incognizant patient\u2019s body and life, but\nless directly if at all by thwarting the patient\u2019s determination\nof what actions to perform. During the violation, the anesthetized\npatient was not performing any action. Likewise, informed consent\nfinds some interventions far more reprehensible than others, although\ntheir impacts on our autonomous action and pursuits are similar.\nPerforming a testicular cancer exam without the patient\u2019s\ninformed consent is very problematic, and transgresses core informed\nconsent requirements. It is far harder to justify than looking\ncarefully at a skin mole on a patient\u2019s cheek from across a\nclinic desk, in order to detect cancer, without the patient\u2019s\ninformed consent. Non-consensual facial scrutiny might not even\nviolate informed consent. The main difference seems to be in whether a\nsensitive area of the patient\u2019s body is being touched and\nscrutinized without the patient\u2019s consent, which can constitute\nextreme battery; and not in the patient\u2019s exercise of agency,\nsay, in the number or nature of the patient\u2019s actions and plans\nthat are thereby blocked. It may be true that extreme battery\nsymbolizes extreme contempt towards the patient as a sovereign agent,\nbut here, at least, it does not involve greater interference with his\nautonomy as characterized above.\n\nRegardless of either the exact meaning of autonomy or the extent to\nwhich autonomy is good for us, grounding informed consent in autonomy\nturns out to be difficult. First, autonomous decision making over\nall matters that heavily affect one\u2019s health is not\nsomething to which any patient has a right. Organ waitlists, for\ninstance, can be perfectly legitimate even when some patients demand\nin full voluntariness the next available organ and autonomously refuse\nto wait in line. Just because receiving the organ would serve their\nautonomous wills does not make it their right to obtain organs\ndesignated to others ahead of them on the list without interference.\nAdmittedly, the autonomy rationale may here be conjoined with a\nclarification as to which matters concerning patients\u2019 health\nthey have a right to determine. But for some that right would then be\nthe reason why their consent is required, when it is required\n(McConnell 2018), potentially making any further reference to autonomy\nredundant.\n\nA second challenge to grounding informed consent requirements in\nautonomy is that violating informed consent requirements can have\npositive impact on autonomy. One example is when closing off an\noption, in violation of informed consent, enables more important\nfreedoms. For instance, closing off patients\u2019 options for\nvoluntary euthanasia was said to increase their autonomy by freeing\nthem, as well as similar patients, from family pressure to use that\noption (Velleman 1992); surely it may do so even when accomplished\nthrough forced injection of an antidote or other violations of\ninformed consent.\n\nA third challenge is that not all acts that are generally assumed to\nviolate informed consent seem contrary to autonomous decision-making.\nSuppose that a sufficiently capacitated adult patient refuses a safe,\nbeneficial, and time-sensitive surgery to prevent a moderate\ndisability, due to a simple misunderstanding of medical facts. There\nis no time to convince him of his mistake. Being uninformed, his\ndecision cannot count as autonomous. But present medical practices\nsurrounding informed consent continue to forbid, possibly for good\nreasons, forcing care on such a patient\u2014for example, strapping\nhim to the bed to deliver an operation. In such instances, the problem\nwith forced care cannot be simply violation of autonomy. Some have\nargued in somewhat similar cases that forced care is legitimate,\nbecause it would contravene \u201cmere desire\u201d not\n\u201crational desire\u201d (Savulescu 1994), and because \u201cthe\nstate has the right to prevent self-regarding harmful\nconduct\u2026when\u2026 that conduct is substantially\nnonvoluntary\u2026\u201d (Feinberg 1986, 12). A different possible\nconclusion is that present informed consent practices are sound, they\njust rest on justifications other than respect for personal autonomy;\nsurely a \u201cNo\u201d to an intervention in the body is often a\n\u201cNo\u201d even when the patient lacks the capacity or the\ninformation to authorize an autonomous \u201cYes\u201d (compare\nEstlund 2007, 121\u20135; Gunderson 1990). A third possible\nconclusion is that while what is wrong with forced care in this\nsetting is the violation of autonomy, what \u201cautonomy\u201d\nmeans here is simply a domain over which one should remain sovereign\nand have the final say, even if uninformed, incapacitated, and so\nforth (Enoch 2017, 31\u201332). This, however, is not how\n\u201cautonomy\u201d is used in bioethics.\n\nAs a final challenge to grounding informed consent in autonomy,\nconsider a patient who has been treated fairly and offered a simple\nexplanation of her treatment and the alternatives, which she could\ncomprehend if she tried; her failure to comprehend it and to choose\nautonomously is the fruit of her own neglect. Can the physician or the\ninvestigator really be blamed for the patient\u2019s consequent\nnon-autonomous choice (Sreenivasan 2003; Miller and Wertheimer 2010,\n85, 95; Millum and Bromwich 2013)? In many areas of life in which\nconsent seems necessary, what matters is not so much the\n\u201cquality of choice,\u201d say, how autonomous it is, but\nwhether the person had been given the opportunity to make a choice of\nthat quality (Scanlon 1988). Advocates of the autonomy rationale may\nrespond in one of two ways. First, they may insist that when an\ninvestigator did due diligence to help candidate participants\nunderstand the significant risks of a study yet sees that they have\nnot been understood, she has a reason to explain again, or recruit\nother candidates, precisely because the autonomy of study\nparticipation matters; alternatively, they may insist that having been\ngiven real opportunity to decide autonomously already counts as having\nbeen given autonomy over the matter.\n",
