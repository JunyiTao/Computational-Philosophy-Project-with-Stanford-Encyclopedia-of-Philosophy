In ordinary life, we reason with varying degrees of success\nabout what others know. We are especially concerned with what others\nknow about us, and often specifically about what they know about what\nwe know.\n\n\nDoes she know that I know where she buried the treasure?\n\nDoes she know that I know that she knows?\n\nAnd so on.\n\n\nEpistemic logic can reveal interesting epistemic features of systems\ninvolving groups of agents. In some cases, for example, emergent\nsocial phenomena depend on agents reasoning in particular ways about\nthe knowledge and beliefs of other agents. As we have seen,\ntraditional systems of epistemic logic applied only to single-agent\ncases. However, they can be extended to groups or multi-agent systems\nin a relatively straightforward manner.\n\nAs David Lewis noted in his book Convention (1969) many\nprominent features of social life depend on agents assuming that the\nrules of some practice are matters of common knowledge. For\nexample, drivers know that a red traffic light indicates that they\nshould stop at an intersection. However, for the convention of traffic\nlights to be in place at all, it is first necessary that drivers must\nalso know that other drivers know that red means\nstop. In addition, drivers must also know that everyone knows\nthat everyone knows that \u2026. The conventional role of traffic\nlights relies on all drivers knowing that all drivers know the rule,\nthat the rule is a piece of\n common knowledge.\n\nA variety of norms, social and linguistic practices, agent\ninteractions and games presuppose common knowledge, first formalized\nby Aumann (1976) and with earliest epistemic logical treatments by\nLehmann (1984) and by Halpern and Moses (1984). In order to see how\nepistemic logic sheds light on these phenomena, it is necessary to\nintroduce a little more formalism. Following the standard treatment\n(see, e.g., Fagin et al. 1995), we can syntactically augment the\nlanguage of propositional logic with n knowledge operators, one\nfor each agent involved in the group of agents under consideration.\nThe primary difference between the semantics given for a mono-agent\nand a multi-agent semantics is roughly that n accessibility\nrelations are introduced. A modal system for n agents is\nobtained by joining together n modal logics where for\nsimplicity it may be assumed that the agents are homogenous in the\nsense that they may all be described by the same logical system. The\nepistemic logical system for n agents consists of n\ncopies of a certain modal system. In such an extended epistemic logic\nit is possible to express that some agent in the group knows a certain\nfact that an agent knows that another agent knows a fact etc. It is\npossible to develop the logic even further: Not only may an agent know\nthat another agent knows a fact, but they may all know this fact\nsimultaneously.\n",
