Mohism originates in the teachings of Mo Di, or\n\u201cMozi\u201d (\u201cMaster Mo,\u201d fl. ca. 430 BCE), from\nwhom it takes its name.  Mozi and his followers initiated\nphilosophical argumentation and debate in China. They were the first\nin the tradition to engage, like Socrates in ancient Greece, in an\nexplicit, reflective search for objective moral standards and to give\nstep-by-step, tightly reasoned arguments for their views, though their\nreasoning is sometimes simplistic or rests on doubtful\nassumptions. They formulated China\u2019s first explicit ethical and\npolitical theories and advanced the world\u2019s earliest form of\nconsequentialism, a remarkably sophisticated version based on a\nplurality of intrinsic goods taken as constitutive of collective human welfare.\nThe Mohists applied a pragmatic, non-representational theory of\nlanguage and knowledge and developed a rudimentary theory of\nanalogical argumentation. They played a key role in articulating and\nshaping many of the central concepts, assumptions, and issues of\nclassical Chinese philosophical discourse.\n\n\nA later branch of the school (see the entry on\n Mohist Canons)\n formulated a sophisticated semantic theory, epistemology,\nconsequentialist ethics, theory of analogical reasoning, and mereological\nontology and undertook inquiries in such diverse fields as geometry,\nmechanics, optics, and economics. They addressed technical problems\nraised by their semantics and consequentialist ethics and produced a\ncollection of terse, rigorous arguments that develop Mohist doctrines,\ndefend them against criticisms, and rebut opponents\u2019 views.\n\n\nCentral elements of Mohist thought include advocacy of a unified\nethical and political order grounded in a consequentialist ethic emphasizing\nimpartial concern for all; active opposition to military aggression and\ninjury to others; devotion to utility and frugality and condemnation of\nwaste and luxury; support for a centralized, authoritarian state led by\na virtuous, benevolent sovereign and managed by a hierarchical,\nmerit-based bureaucracy; and reverence for and obedience to Heaven\n(Tian, literally the sky) and the ghosts worshiped in\ntraditional folk religion. Mohist ethics and epistemology are\ncharacterized by a concern with finding objective standards that will\nguide judgment and action reliably and impartially so as to produce\nbeneficial, morally right consequences. The Mohists assume that people\nare naturally motivated to do what they believe is right, and thus with\nproper moral education will generally tend to conform to the correct\nethical norms. They believe strongly in the power of discussion and\npersuasion to solve ethical problems and motivate action, and they are\nconfident that moral and political questions have objective answers\nthat can be discovered and defended by inquiry.\n", "toc": [{"#Mozi": "1.

Mozi and the Mohists\n\n\nMohism springs from the teachings of Mo Di, or Mozi (\u201cMaster\nMo\u201d),[1]\n about whom little is known, not even what\nstate he was from. The Shi Ji, a Han dynasty record, tells us\nonly that he was an official of the state of Song and that he lived\neither at the same time as or after Confucius (d. 479 BCE), with whom\nhe is often paired by Qin (221\u2013206 BCE) and Han dynasty (206 BCE\u2013219\nCE) texts as the two great moral teachers of the Warring States era.\nMost likely, he flourished during the middle to late decades of the 5th\ncentury BCE, roughly contemporaneous with Socrates in the West.\n\u2018Mo\u2019 is an unusual surname and the common Chinese word for\n\u201cink.\u201d Hence scholars have speculated that the name may have been an epithet referring to the dark or tattooed skin of a laborer or convict or a transliteration from a non-Chinese language. However, \u2018Mo\u2019 could simply have been an uncommon ancient surname that later ceased to be used.\n\n\nA strong argument can be made that it is Mozi, not Confucius, who\ndeserves the title of China\u2019s first philosopher. Before the rise of the\nMohist school, Ru or so-called\n \u201cConfucian\u201d[2]\n thought seems to have consisted mostly of wise aphorisms offering\nmoral coaching aimed at developing virtuous performers of social roles\nas described in traditional li (norms of ritual\npropriety). Mozi and his followers were the first in the Chinese\ntradition to point out that conformity to traditional mores in itself\ndoes not ensure that actions are morally right. This critical insight\nmotivated a self-conscious search for\n objective moral standards,\n by which the Mohists hoped to unify the moral judgments of everyone in\nsociety, thus eliminating social disorder and ensuring that morality\nprevailed.  The normative standard through which they proposed to\nachieve these aims was the \u201cbenefit (l\u00ec) of all \nthe world\u201d: Actions, practices, and policies that promote the\noverall welfare of society were to be considered morally right, those\nthat interfere with it morally wrong. This consequentialist standard was\njustified by appeal to the intention of Heaven (Tian),\na sky or nature deity that the Mohists claimed is committed impartially to\nthe benefit of all. Heaven\u2019s intention provides a reliable epistemic\ncriterion for moral judgment, they held, because Heaven is the wisest\nand noblest agent in the cosmos. This basic consequentialist and religious\nframework motivated a set of\n ten core ethical and political doctrines,\n which the Mohists sought to persuade the rulers of their day to put into\npractice. This article will discuss the\n motivation\n for the Mohist philosophical and\npolitical project, the central\n epistemic\nand\n logical\n notions that structure Mohist thought,\nand the details of the Mohists\u2019\n ethical\n and\n political\n doctrines, including their strengths\nand weaknesses.\n\n\nOur primary source for the thought of Mozi and his followers is a\ncorpus of anonymously authored texts collected into a book called the\nMozi. Other, less direct sources include anecdotes and\ncomments about the Mohists preserved in early texts such as the\nLushi Chunqiu, Hanfeizi, Zhuangzi, and\nHuainanzi and criticisms of them by two of their major\nopponents, the Confucians Mencius (ca. 372\u2013289 BCE) and Xunzi (fl.\n289\u2013238 BCE). The Mozi is a diverse compilation of polemical\nessays, short dialogues, anecdotes about Mozi, and compact\nphilosophical discussions, the different parts of the book ranging in\ndate from the 5th to the 3rd century BCE. For a detailed discussion of\nthe organization, nature, and authorship of the Mozi, see the\nfollowing supplement:\nTexts and Authorship\n\n\nThe Mohist texts provide only the barest handful of clues about\nMozi\u2019s life. One passage depicts King Hui of Chu (488\u2013432 BCE)\nrefusing to grant him an audience because of his low social status.\nSeveral anecdotes in the Mozi and other early texts depict him\nas a master craftsman and military engineer. The Huainanzi, a\nHan dynasty text, claims that Mozi was an apostate Ru\n(Confucian), but the Mozi itself provides no particular reason\nto believe this. A more likely conjecture, supported by the frequency\nof references to the crafts in Mohist texts, is that he was originally\nan artisan of some kind, probably a carpenter. Indeed, the many\nexamples alluding to crafts, mechanics, trade, work, and economic\nhardship, the apparent \u201ccritical outsider\u201d stance of the earliest\nMohist texts, and the nearly total absence of references to the\nli (courtly ritual, ceremony, etiquette) so central to\nConfucian thought all tend to suggest that Mohism emerged from a rising\nclass of craftsmen, merchants, and soldiers that grew in size and\npolitical influence during the Warring States era, a time of rapid\nsocial and political change. For an exploration of the impact of this\nsocial background on Mohist thought, see the following supplement:\n\nInfluence of Social Origins on Mohist Thought\n\n\n\nAs their movement flourished in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, the\nMohists branched into a number of groups, each led by a juzi,\nor grand master. Two early sources, the Hanfeizi (Book 50, ca.\n233 BCE or later) and the Zhuangzi (Book 33, perhaps 2nd\ncentury BCE), mention a total of six groups of Mohists, who apparently\nquarreled among themselves over the details of Mohist doctrine. Another\nearly text, the Lushi Chunqiu (ca. 239 BCE), mentions at\nleast three other Mohist juzi. Evidence from the Mozi\nand Lushi Chunqiu indicates that these Mohist groups were\ndisciplined organizations devoted to moral and practical education,\npolitical advocacy, government service, and in some cases military\nservice. Members underwent a period of study and training, after which\nthe organization might find them positions in government or the\nmilitary, probably in a Mohist regiment. Members were expected to\ncontribute funds to the organization and could be expelled for failing\nto fulfill their duties. The Mohists were renowned for fervent\ncommitment to their ethical principles and to a lifestyle of austerity\nand self-sacrifice. A Han dynasty text collected in the\nZhuangzi claims that many Mohists believed it was their duty\nto emulate the legendary altruistic labors of the ancient sage king\nYu:\nMany of the Mohists of later ages\nwear furs and rough clothing, clogs and grass slippers, never resting\nday or night, taking self-sacrifice as the highest. They say, \u201cOne who\ncannot do this is not following the way of Yu and doesn\u2019t deserve to\nbe called a Mohist.\u201d \u2026 They press each other forward in\nself-sacrifice until there\u2019s no flesh left on their calves or hair on\ntheir shins. (Zhuangzi, Book 33, \u201cUnder Heaven\u201d)\n\n\nSuch external testimony \u2014 albeit from an unsympathetic source\n\u2014 presents a minor puzzle in the interpretation of Mohist\nthought, for the texts preserved in the Mozi do not directly\nadvocate self-sacrificing altruism, and at least one clearly rejects\nit. The same Zhuangzi passage tells us that different groups\nof Mohists disagreed strongly concerning the details of Mohist\ndoctrine; perhaps this was one of the issues about which they\ndiffered.\n\n\nAs the name implies, the Warring States era saw the pre-imperial Chinese world divided into\nnumerous states that frequently fell to war with each other, each of\nthe larger, more powerful states aspiring to conquer its neighbors and\nunify the empire under its rule. The Mohists were deeply committed to\nthe ideal of a harmonious, peaceful social order and to universal\nconcern for the welfare of all the world. They condemned\nunprovoked military aggression and attempted to dissuade warlike rulers\nfrom attacking other states. Far from being pacifists, however, they\nsaw a strong defense force as crucial to state survival. Indeed, many\nMohists seem to have concluded that, since social order was a paramount\nvalue and gratuitous warfare was wrong, they had a duty to assist\nvictims of aggression. Some Mohists became specialists in defensive\nwarfare, rushing to the aid of cities and states under threat of\nattack. The last quarter of the Mozi preserves the texts of\nthese militias, which present detailed information about ancient\ndefense tactics and siege fortifications (for an overview, see Yates,\n1980).\n2. The Ten Mohist Doctrines\n\n\nAs their movement developed, the Mohists came to present themselves as\noffering a collection of ten key doctrines, divided into five pairs.\nThe ten doctrines correspond to the titles of the\n ten triads,\n the ten sets of three essays\nthat form the core of the Mozi. Although the essays in each\ntriad differ in detail, the gist of each doctrine may be briefly\nsummarized as follows. \n\n\u201cPromoting the Worthy\u201d and \u201cIdentifying\nUpward.\u201d The purpose of government is to achieve a stable\nsocial, economic, and political order (zhi, pronounced \u201cjr\u201d)\nby promulgating a unified conception of morality (yi). This\ntask of moral education is to be carried out by encouraging everyone to\n\u201cidentify upward\u201d to the good example set by social and political\nsuperiors and by rewarding those who do so and punishing those who do\nnot. Government is to be structured as a centralized, bureaucratic\nstate led by a virtuous monarch and managed by a hierarchy of appointed\nofficials. Appointments are to be made on the basis of competence and\nmoral merit, without regard for candidates\u2019 social status or\norigins.\n\u201cInclusive Care\u201d and \u201cCondemning\nAggression.\u201d To achieve social order and exemplify the key\nvirtue of ren (benevolence, goodwill), people must inclusively\ncare for each other, having as much concern for others\u2019 lives,\nfamilies, and communities as for their own, and in their relations with\nothers seek to benefit them. Military aggression is wrong for the same\nreasons that theft, robbery, and murder are: it harms others in pursuit\nof selfish benefit, while ultimately failing to benefit Heaven, the\nspirits, or society as a whole.\n\u201cModeration in Use\u201d and \u201cModeration in\nBurial.\u201d To benefit society and care for the welfare of the\npeople, wasteful luxury and useless expenditures must be eliminated.\nSeeking always to bring wealth to the people and order to society, the\nren (benevolent) person avoids wasting resources on extravagant\nfunerals and prolonged mourning (customs promoted by the Ru and others).\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s Intent\u201d and \u201cUnderstanding\nGhosts.\u201d Heaven is the noblest, wisest moral agent, so its\nintent is a reliable, objective standard of what is morally righteous\n(yi) and must be respected. Heaven rewards those who obey its\nintent and punishes those who defy it, hence people should strive to\nbe benevolent and do what is righteous. Social and moral order (zhi)\ncan be advanced by encouraging belief in ghosts and spirits who reward\nthe good and punish the wicked.\n\u201cCondemning Music\u201d and \u201cCondemning\nFatalism.\u201d The benevolent (ren) person opposes the\nextravagant musical entertainment and other luxuries enjoyed by rulers\nand high officials, because these waste resources that could otherwise\nbe used for feeding and clothing the common people. Fatalism is not\nren, because by teaching that our lot in life is predestined\nand human effort is useless, it interferes with the pursuit of economic\nwealth, a large population, and social order (three primary goods that\nthe benevolent person desires for society). Fatalism fails to meet a series\nof justificatory criteria and so must be rejected.\n\n\n\nWhen an audience with the ruler of a state was secured, different\ndoctrines might be advocated first, depending on the circumstances in\nthat state:\nIf the state is in disorder, then expound \u201cpromoting the\nworthy\u201d and \u201cidentifying upward\u201d; if the state is poor, then expound\n\u201cmoderation in use\u201d and \u201cmoderation in burial\u201d; if the state\noverindulges in musical entertainment, then expound \u201ccondemning music\u201d\nand \u201ccondemning fate\u201d; if the state is dissolute and indecorous, expound\n\u201chonoring Heaven\u201d and \u201cserving ghosts\u201d; if the state is devoted to\naggression and intimidation, then expound \u201cinclusive care\u201d and\n\u201ccondemning aggression.\u201d (Book 49, \u201cQuestions of\n Lu\u201d).[3]\n\n\nAs this passage and the capsule summaries of their ten core\ndoctrines indicate, the Mohists saw themselves primarily as a moral,\npolitical, and religious advocacy group devoted to realizing what they\nsaw as a morally right society and way of life, one that promotes\n\u201cbenefit\u201d (l\u00ec) and eliminates \u201charm\u201d (hai) for\nall the world. \u201cBenefit\u201d (l\u00ec) for them is a loose\nconception of general welfare comprising material prosperity, an\nabundant population, and sociopolitical \u201corder\u201d (zhi). This\nlatter term denotes social conditions in which crime, deceit,\nharassment, strife, and military aggression are absent, people\ncooperate with and assist each other, those without family to support\nthem are cared for, and individuals manifest the virtues appropriate to\ntheir roles as rulers, subjects, fathers, sons, and brothers. The\nMohists\u2019\n ethical theory\n is an interesting,\ncomplex form of consequentialism that posits a plurality of intrinsic\ngoods, which are to be promoted through a variety of strategies.\n\n\nAside from their ethical and\n political doctrines\n \u2014 the aspects of their philosophy they themselves see as\ncentral \u2014 the Mohists\u2019 explicit theories and implicit assumptions\nabout language,\n knowledge,\n reasoning,\n and moral psychology are of great\nphilosophical interest. Many aspects of their views in these areas are\nprobably not distinctively Mohist, but instead reflect background\nassumptions widely shared by other classical Chinese thinkers. Thus a\ngreater understanding of Mohist thought advances our understanding of\nearly Confucianism, Daoism, and other schools as well.\n3. The Search for Objective Standards\n\n\nA central concern in Mohist thought is to secure zhi\n(pronounced \u201cjr\u201d), or moral, social, and political order, an intrinsic\ngood that the Mohists assume everyone in society will value. According\nto Mohist\n political theory,\n this aim is\nachieved by unifying society\u2019s moral standards, so that people will\nagree in their value judgments, thus eliminating any potential reasons\nfor conflict. The unified moral standards cannot be chosen arbitrarily,\nhowever, for if people see that the standards do not genuinely promote\nsocial and moral order, they will defy them. So a crucial question for\nthe Mohists is: What shall we take as the basis for unified moral norms? \n\n\nOne answer, accepted by many Ru (Confucians) and other\n\u201cgentlemen of the world\u201d criticized by the Mohists, is the li\n(ritual propriety, ceremony), a traditional code of propriety specifying behavior\nappropriate for individuals playing different social roles in various\ntypes of\n situations.[4]\n We can take the li, supplemented by\nthe situational discretion (quan) of the virtuous gentleman,\nas a basic standard of conduct. This solution of course presupposes a\nrough, gentlemanly consensus about what is and is not appropriate\nbehavior. Such a consensus seems to be assumed by the major Confucian\nfigure Mencius, for instance, who sees little need to develop an\nexplicit normative ethical theory, focusing instead on moral\npsychology.\n\n\nPerhaps partly because of their\n social origins,\n Mozi and his followers do not identify with the\nli (ritual) of the traditional high culture and so find this\nsort of traditionalist consensus an unconvincing moral guide. To the\nsuggestion that tradition can serve as a reliable moral standard, they\nrespond by distinguishing between traditional customs and morality as\nsuch, pointing out that conformity to tradition is not in itself\nsufficient to ensure moral correctness. They make this point by\nconsidering \u2014 at roughly the same time Herodotus was raising\nsimilar issues in Greece \u2014 the challenge to parochial\nconceptions of what is right posed by the existence of disparate\ncultural practices.\nNow those who uphold rich burials and prolonged mourning\nsay: \u201cIf rich burials and prolonged mourning turn out not to be\nthe Way of the sage-kings, then how do we explain why the gentlemen of\nthe central states perform them without ceasing and maintain them\nwithout choosing something else?!\u201d\n Our Master Mozi said, \u201cThis is what\u2019s called deeming their\nhabits convenient and their customs righteous. In the past, east of\nYue there was the country of Gai Shu. When their eldest son was born,\nthey chopped him up and ate him, calling this \u2018advantageous to the\nyounger brothers.\u2019 When their grandfather died, they carried off their\ngrandmother and abandoned her, saying, \u2018One cannot live with the wife\nof a ghost.\u2019 These practices superiors took as government policy and\nsubordinates took as custom, performing them without ceasing and\nmaintaining them without choosing something else. Yet how could these\nreally be the Way of benevolence and righteousness?!\u201d (Book 25,\n\u201cModeration in Burial\u201d)\n\n\n\nDifferent cultures may have different, conflicting customs, some of\nwhich may be morally wrong by our lights. Since other cultures\u2019\ncustoms may be wrong, by parity of reasoning, so might our own. The\nmere fact that a practice is traditional or customary, as\nthe li (rituals, ceremonies) are, does not show that it is\nright in the objective, universal sense expressed by moral concepts\nsuch as ren (benevolence) and yi (righteousness,\nmorality). The li thus cannot serve as an authoritative standard\nof a unified morality. We need to find other, objectively justified\nstandards.\n\n\nThis search for objective moral standards by which to guide action\nand reform society lies at the heart of the Mohist philosophical and\npolitical\n project.[5]\n The master idea driving Mohist thought is\nthat in ethics and politics, as in any other practical field, we can\nindeed find and apply such standards, which the Mohists call\nfa (models, paradigms, standards). A text from one of the\nlater portions of the Mozi explains the role of fa in\nthis way:\n\n\nOur Master Mozi said, \u201cThose in the world who perform tasks\ncannot do without models (fa) and standards. There is no one\nwho can accomplish their task without models and standards. Even\nofficers serving as generals or ministers, they all have models; even\nthe hundred artisans performing their tasks, they too all have\nmodels. The hundred artisans make squares with the set square, circles\nwith the compass, straight lines with the string, vertical lines with\nthe plumb line, and flat surfaces with the level. Whether skilled\nartisans or unskilled artisans, all take these five as models. The\nskilled are able to conform to them. The unskilled, though unable to\nconform to them, by following them in performing their tasks still\nsurpass what they can do by themselves. Thus the hundred artisans in\nperforming their tasks all have models to measure by.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow for the greatest to order (zhi, also\n\u2018govern\u2019) the world and those the next level down to order great\nstates without models to measure by, this is to be less\ndiscriminating than the hundred artisans.\u201d (Book 4, \u201cModels and\nStandards\u201d)\n\n\n\nAs this passage indicates, the Mohists regard fa (models) as\nsimilar to tools used to guide and check the performance of skilled\ntasks, such as sawing a square corner or drawing a straight line.\nFa are objective, reliable, and easy to use, so that with\nminimal training anyone can employ them to perform a task or check the\nresults. Fa alone do not ensure success, nor do they erase\nthe distinction between the skilled and unskilled \u2014 or between\nthe virtuous and those still acquiring virtue \u2014 but for most of\nus they at least ensure that we will do better than we would without\nthem.\n\n\nOur primary task in governing or \u201cordering\u201d (zhi)\nsociety, then, is to find reliable, objective models or standards to\nguide our actions, practices, and policies. As in the case of the\nli (ritual), however, the Mohists point out that any standard\nspecific to our particular family, education, or community could turn\nout to be unreliable. \u201cModels and Standards,\u201d the text\ncited above, continues:\nThat being so, then what is acceptable to take as a model\n(fa) for order (zhi)? How would it be for everyone to\nmodel themselves on their parents? Those in the world who are parents\nare many, but those who are benevolent (ren) are few; if\nall model themselves on their parents, this is modeling\nthe unbenevolent. Modeling on the unbenevolent \u2014 it\u2019s not acceptable to\ntake that as a model.\n\n\nHaving objected to taking parents as a fundamental moral model, the\npassage next rejects teachers (or \u201clearning\u201d) and rulers on\nthe same grounds: We cannot be sure that all teachers and political\nleaders are benevolent (ren). The text concludes that\n\u201cof these three, parents, teachers, and rulers, none is\nacceptable as a model for order.\u201d An objective standard is\nneeded, one that is not morally fallible in the way that any\nparticular individual role model or cultural tradition might be. The\nMohists propose that we can find such a standard by considering the\nattitudes of an ideally impartial, benevolent, and reliable moral\nagent: Tian (Heaven, nature, the sky), whom they revere as a\nquasi-personal god.\nThat being so, then what is acceptable to take as a model\nfor order? So I say, Nothing is like modeling on Heaven.  Heaven\u2019s\nconduct is broad and impartial; its favors are rich and incur no debt;\nits brightness endures without fading. So the sage-kings modeled\nthemselves on it. (Book 4, \u201cModels and\nStandards\u201d)\n\n\nThis notion of taking Heaven as a moral role model leads the Mohists\nto develop a credible normative theory based on equal, impartial\nconcern for the welfare of all. At the same time, however, it steers\nthem into formulating some of their central normative principles in a\npotentially problematic way. Their conception of Tian\n(Heaven) provides a compelling basis for arguing that everyone\u2019s\ninterests have equal moral worth. But since the Mohists believe\nthat Tian acts impartially on everyone\u2019s behalf, adopting it\nas a moral model tends to imply that each of us as individuals is\nobliged to treat others and ourselves equally \u2014 to act in\nothers\u2019 interest exactly as we act in our own. This view, if indeed\nthe Mohists hold it, would invite several objections commonly leveled\nat crude forms of utilitarianism. The most obvious is that\nlimitations on our time and resources make it practically impossible\nfor us to act equally on others\u2019 behalf as well as our\nown. (In practice, I cannot possibly make breakfast for everyone each\nmorning, only for myself, my family, and perhaps a few neighbors.)\nAnother possible objection would be that by demanding excessive\nattention to the needs of others, Mohist ethics leaves individuals\nwith insufficient resources to live their own lives well, thus\nsacrificing much of what makes an individual life good.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 ethical theory thus raises fundamental questions\nconcerning the moral claim on us of others\u2019 interests, the role of\nimpartiality, fairness, and benevolence in an adequate ethical code,\nand the elements of a good life \u2014 questions that remain vital in\nmoral philosophy today. We will return to some of these issues and the\nMohists\u2019 response to them when we assess the Mohist ethical theory\nbelow. First, however, we need to explore further the concept of a\n\u201cmodel\u201d presupposed by Mohists\u2019 notion of \u201ctaking Heaven as a\nmodel.\u201d\nThe Concept of Fa (Models)\n\n\nThe Mohists refer to the objective ethical standard they seek as a\nfa (model, standard), a concept that plays a central part in\ntheir ethics and their views on language, knowledge, and argumentation\nor reasoning. Fa is among the key notions through which Mohism\nhad an important influence on the late Warring States Confucian thinker\nXunzi and his student Han Fei, leading representative of a style of\nrealpolitik thought that later became known as the fa jia\n(school of fa, often translated as \u201clegalism\u201d). Fa\nhave a dual role, providing both practical guidelines and justificatory\ncriteria for judgment and action. In their action-guiding role,\nfa serve as guidelines or decision criteria that direct action\nand practical reasoning. In this respect, they are an important part of\nthe Mohists\u2019 explanation of how we learn language and ethical norms and\nof the cognitive processes by which we reason, form judgments, and act.\nIn their justificatory role, on the other hand, fa may\nfunction as fundamental standards of correctness by which to justify\nactions and judgments.\n\n\nA notable feature of \u201cModels and Standards,\u201d the Mohist text\ndiscussed in the preceding section, is that the candidate fa\nconsidered are not ethical principles, but virtuous agents, such as\nparents and teachers, whom we can take as role models. This observation\nprovides a key to understanding both the concept of fa and,\nmore broadly, the orientation of Mohist views about language,\nknowledge, cognition, and reasoning.\n\n\nThe term fa denotes any guide, aid, or tool for following a\nnorm or making a judgment. Explicit rules, laws, and definitions are\nall fa. But fa may also be role models, such as a\nvirtuous parent, teacher, or ruler. They may be prototypes, exemplars,\nanalogies, or pictures of some kind of thing, or they may be tools or\nmeasuring devices, such as a yardstick or a carpenter\u2019s compass and set square. They may even be concepts, such as \u201cthe benefit\n(l\u00ec) of the world,\u201d which the Mohists take to be\nco-extensive with and thus a criterion for identifying what is\nyi (morally righteous). In short, any criterion or paradigm that\nhelps us to make correct judgments or to act correctly can be a\nfa.\n\n\nThe reason such a wide range of items can serve as fa is\nthat the Mohists regard fa primarily not as principles or\nrules, but as different types of practical models used to guide the\nperformance of norm-governed activities. The objective ethical\nstandards they seek are not definitions or universal principles, from\nwhich they will derive particular consequences by deductive reasoning.\nInstead, they seek a reliable role model or paradigm for their actions and practices to copy or emulate. This is why they can propose,\nas their highest fa or ethical standard, not a normative\nprinciple, but Heaven itself, considered as the highest, most reliable\nmoral agent in the natural order.\n\n\nThe prominence of practical models or exemplars reflects two\nfundamental features of Mohist thought and arguably of classical\nChinese philosophy generally. The first is its practical, pragmatic\norientation. The focus of early Chinese thought is on correct practical\nperformance, not theoretical description or representation. The concept\nthat stands at the center of the classical discourse is dao\n(way), a notion that refers to norms, patterns, and methods of\nacting, specifically of ordering the state and conducting\none\u2019s personal life. The central questions for early Chinese\nthinkers are not What is the truth, and how do we know it? but What is\nthe dao (way), and how do we follow\n it?[6]\n The fundamental aim is not an intellectual grasp of a definition or\nprinciple, but the practical ability to follow a norm or perform a\ntask successfully.  Fa are in effect tools to aid us in\nfollowing the dao, and anything that guides practical\nperformance effectively can serve as a fa. A concrete\nexemplar or model that one can emulate is considered as useful as a\nprinciple or definition (indeed, principles and definitions are\napparently seen as one variety of practical model).\n\n\nThe second, interrelated feature is that the Mohists regard\ncognition, judgment, and inference as processes of analogical pattern recognition\n\u2014 specifically, processes of distinguishing relevantly similar kinds\nof objects, events, or actions from dissimilar\n ones.[7]\n This sort of process is referred to as distinguishing (bian)\nwhat is \u201cthis\u201d (shi) from what is \u201cnot\u201d\n(fei). (Shi and fei are pronounced roughly\n\u201cshr\u201d and \u201cfey.\u201d) Drawing such distinctions is a practical skill, the\nexecution of which can be aided by reference to models or exemplars \u2014\nthat is, fa.  Fa are in effect reference prototypes\nfor use in pattern recognition.\n\n\nBoth of these features are illustrated by how the Mohists describe\nthe application of fa. The following passage explains the role\nof \u201cHeaven\u2019s intent\u201d as an ethical fa by likening it to the\ncompass, a model against which the wheelwright compares objects to\ndistinguish whether they are round or not.\nThus our Master Mozi\u2019s having Heaven\u2019s intent, to give an\nanalogy, is no different from the wheelwright\u2019s having a compass or\nthe carpenter\u2019s having a set square. Now the wheelwright grasps his\ncompass and uses it to measure the round and not round in the world,\nsaying, \u201cWhat conforms to my compass, call it\n\u2018round,\u2019 what doesn\u2019t conform to my compass, call it\n\u2018not round.\u2019\u201d Hence round and not round can both be\nknown. What is the reason for this?  It\u2019s that the fa for\n\u201cround\u201d is clear. (Book 27, \u201cHeaven\u2019s\nIntent\u201d)\n\n\nFormally, ethical fa are not regarded as general principles\nthat we apply as the major premise of a kind of deductive argument,\nsuch as a practical syllogism. Rather, they are seen as paradigms or\nprototypes against which we compare something to distinguish, or\nbian, whether or not it falls under the extension of a term,\nsuch as \u2018yi\u2019 (duty, righteousness). Drawing distinctions\nin this way is the functional equivalent, in Mohist thought, of making\na judgment or forming a belief. The ability to draw the distinctions\ncorrectly is knowledge. Moreover, the process of citing a fa,\ncomparing something to it, and then judging whether the two are similar\nconstitutes the Mohists\u2019 basic conception of practical reasoning. Since\nfor the Mohists fa include rules as well as models and\nexamples, in their eyes the process of deducing a conclusion from a\ngeneral rule or principle is in effect a special case of the more\ngeneral cognitive process of comparing things to models and drawing\ndistinctions. Thus they tend to explain all forms of reasoning,\nincluding deductive inference, as species of pattern recognition or\nanalogical reasoning.\n\n\nBecause they play such a central role in the Mohist conception of\ncognition and reasoning, fa can be treated as a key to\nunderstanding the Mohists\u2019 approach not only to ethics, but to\nepistemology, semantics, and logic or argumentation. Action, linguistic\ncommunication, knowledge, and reasoning are all explained by appeal to\nthe practical activity of drawing distinctions according to public\nnorms. Fa are models or standards that aid us in following\nsuch norms reliably. In ethics, they take the place of universal\nethical principles in moral reasoning and in guiding action. In\nepistemology, they are public criteria that guide distinction drawing\nand thus justify claims to knowledge. In semantic theory, they are part\nof the explanation of why words refer to what they do: a word is\nassociated with a fa (exemplar) by convention and then refers\nto everything deemed relevantly similar to the fa. In\nreasoning or argument, a judgment is established or refuted by citing\none or more fa and showing that the object of the judgment\ndoes or does not conform to the fa.\n4. Epistemology\n\n\nThe Mohists apply several closely interrelated conceptions of\nknowledge, of which the central one is a form of recognition, or\n\u201cknowledge-of.\u201d Knowledge-of is manifested as a practical ability to\ncorrectly distinguish the referent(s) of the word, or \u201cname\u201d\n(ming), that denotes the object of knowledge. It is thus\ninterrelated with and dependent on a kind of practical knowing-how.\nThis knowing-how provides a behavioral criterion by which knowledge is\nassessed: to qualify as having knowledge of x, an agent must\nbe able to reliably pick out the sorts of things denoted by the word\n \u2018x\u2019.[8]\n\n\nThe Mohist conception of knowledge is thus fundamentally practical,\nnot representational or theoretical. Having knowledge is not a matter\nof having a correct representation in one\u2019s mind or being able to give\na theoretical description of some state of affairs, but of being able\nto do something correctly in practice \u2014 specifically, being\nable to distinguish various kinds (lei) of things from one\nanother. Propositional knowledge, to the limited extent that it is\naddressed, is implicitly explained terms of the ability to distinguish\nkinds properly: To know that a is F is to know to\ndistinguish a as the kind of thing denoted by the term\n\u2018F\u2019.\n\n\nThe object of knowledge is typically regarded as a kind of object or\nevent, denoted by a term, rather than a proposition, expressed by a\nsentence. (Grammatically, the verb zhi (to know) most often\ntakes a noun or noun phrase as its object.) Also, since to know a thing\nis to know how to distinguish it from other kinds of things, the object\nof knowledge is sometimes taken to be a distinction, as when the\nMohists speak of \u201cknowing the distinction between righteous and unrighteous\u201d\n(Book 17, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d).\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 primary conception of knowledge is illustrated in\nfollowing passage, which emphasizes that knowledge lies not in the\nability to make correct statements, but the ability to \u201cselect\u201d the\nthings denoted by a word, or \u201cname.\u201d\nOur Master Mozi said, \u201cNow the blind say,\n\u2018What\u2019s bright is white, and what\u2019s dark is black.\u2019 Even\nthe clear-sighted have no grounds for changing this. But collect white\nand black things together and make the blind select from among them,\nand they cannot know. So as to my saying the blind don\u2019t know white\nand black, it\u2019s not by their naming, it\u2019s by their selecting.\u201d\n(Book 47, \u201cValuing Duty\u201d)\n\n\nThe passage depicts the knowledge the blind possess of the colors\nwhite and black as, what we would characterize as, propositional\nknowledge. Yet the text\u2019s central claim is that the blind do\nnot qualify as \u201cknowing white and black,\u201d because they are\nunable to identify them in practice. For the Mohists, the key\ncriterion of knowledge is not the mere ability to make correct\nstatements \u2014 as when the blind \u201cuse the names\n\u2018white\u2019 and \u2018black\u2019 in strings the same way\u201d\nas the sighted \u2014 but the ability to \u201cdistinguish the things\u201d\ndenoted by these words (Book 19, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d).\n\n\nA natural response here would be to point out that the Mohists\u2019 own\nview implicitly recognizes that knowledge of words, or \u201cnames,\u201d\nconstitutes a separate type of knowledge, distinct from knowledge of\nhow to \u201cselect\u201d things. The Mohists ought to categorize knowledge more\nfinely, the response would run, by distinguishing between knowing how\nto use names and knowing how to distinguish the referents of\nnames. (Full mastery of a concept would presumably require both\nabilities.) The later Mohist texts do precisely this, presenting a\nfourfold categorization of knowledge that includes knowledge of names,\nknowledge of things, knowledge of relations between names and things,\nand knowledge of how to act (see the separate entry for \u201cMohist\nCanons\u201d). Nevertheless, in this earlier text, no value is attached to\nknowledge of names. What counts as genuine knowledge is the reliable\nability to distinguish things in practice.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 view of knowledge thus illustrates the practical\norientation of early Chinese thought, as sketched in the discussion of\nfa (models) in the previous section. For the Mohists, knowing\nx does not require knowing the definition, the essence, the\nmeaning, the Platonic Form, nor a description of x. It\nrequires only the practical ability to distinguish x from\nnot-x. This pragmatic view of knowledge contrasts with the\nsemantic orientation of the Greek tradition, as epitomized by\n Plato.[9]\n We find Plato asking What is justice? and\nseeking to answer this question by determining the single essential\nform shared by all just things. By contrast, the Mohists never ask what\nthe essence or definition of yi (righteousness) is. They are\nconcerned only with the problem of how to reliably distinguish\nyi from not-yi. This problem can be solved, they\nassume, by finding appropriate models for drawing the distinction and\nteaching everyone to apply or emulate them. Such models may have a\nutilitarian, empirical basis; they may rest on independent moral\ngrounds; or they may be based simply on the conviction that the actions\nof exemplary moral agents, such as Tian (Heaven) and the\nancient sage-kings, cannot be wrong.\n\n\nThe Mohist conception of knowledge includes no explicit element\ncorresponding to the justification component in the traditional Western\nanalysis of knowledge as justified true belief. Instead, the Mohists\nseem to treat knowledge simply as correct judgment, which they\nunderstand as correct distinction drawing. Justification is not\nidentified as a distinct requirement for knowledge, probably because\nthe Mohists\u2019 conception of \u201ccorrect\u201d distinction drawing implicitly\nincorporates an element of reliability. Knowledge is not merely drawing\na distinction correctly in one case or another, but a reliable ability\nor disposition to draw distinctions correctly in a variety of cases\nover time.\nNow suppose there is a person here, who, seeing a little\nblack, says \u201cBlack,\u201d but seeing much black, says\n\u201cWhite.\u201d Then surely we\u2019d take this person to not know the\ndistinction between white and black. Tasting a little of something\nbitter, he says \u201cBitter,\u201d but tasting much of something\nbitter, he says, \u201cSweet.\u201d Then surely we\u2019d take this\nperson to not know the distinction between sweet and bitter. (Book 17,\n\u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d)\n\n\nA plausible account of the purpose of the justification component in\nthe traditional tripartite analysis of knowledge is that it\ndisqualifies accidentally true beliefs \u2014 beliefs that happen to be\ntrue, but are based on no good reason \u2014 from counting as knowledge.\nThe Mohists handle this issue implicitly, by acknowledging only\nreliably correct distinction drawing as knowledge. Here again, their\nconception of knowledge reflects their overall focus on practical\nperformance. Fundamentally, for them knowledge is not a correspondence\nbetween a mental state and the world, but an ability to perform certain\nskills reliably and correctly.\n\n\nAccordingly, cognitive error \u2014 false assertion or belief \u2014\nis not explained as inaccurate representation, as a lack of\ncorrespondence between assertion or belief and reality, or as a\nfailure to grasp the unchanging reality behind shifting sensory\nappearances. (The distinction between appearance and reality plays no\nrole in Mohist thought and probably none in early Chinese thought as a\nwhole.) Instead, error is understood as \u201cdisorder\u201d (luan) or\n\u201cconfusion\u201d (huo) in drawing distinctions, in effect a\nfailure to perform a skill correctly. Immorality is due to a failure\nto know how to distinguish right from wrong. Those who perpetrate\nunprovoked military aggression, for example, are criticized for the\n\u201cdisorder\u201d in how they distinguish righteous (yi) from unrighteous\n(Book 17, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d).\nThe Three Fa (Models) and the Problem of Justification\n\n\nThe discussion of Mohist epistemology presented so far has been based\non an interpretation of the conception of knowledge implicit in the\nMohists\u2019 remarks in a variety of contexts. Since, unlike the Mohist\nCanons, early Mohist texts do not treat the concept of knowledge\nexplicitly, this interpretation is necessarily conjectural and\nincomplete. When we turn to the issue of justifying claims to\nknowledge, on the other hand, we are on firmer ground, for the Mohists\npresent an explicit, though sketchy, theory based on the concept of\n fa (models, standards).  In outline, the\ntheory is this. To make a judgment is to distinguish what is\n\u201cthis\u201d or \u201cright\u201d (shi, or\n\u201cshr\u201d) in some context from what is \u201cnot\u201d or\n\u201cwrong\u201d (fei, \u201cfey\u201d). The process of\nevaluating whether some statement or action is correct is thus one of\nevaluating whether the distinction on which it is based is has been\ndrawn properly. To guide us in getting the distinctions right, the\nMohists propose that we should establish fa as standards or\ncriteria: What matches the fa is \u201cthis,\u201d and thus\ncorrect; what doesn\u2019t is \u201cnot.\u201d The fa can thus\nbe applied to justify or check knowledge claims. Conformity to\nthe fa provides good grounds for accepting a claim,\nnon-conformity for rejecting it. \n\n\nThe Mohists propose three fa for \u201cstatements\u201d or\n\u201csayings\u201d (yan), by which \u201cthe distinctions\nbetween \u2018this\u2019 and \u2018not\u2019 and benefit and\nharm...can be clearly known\u201d (Book 35, \u201cCondemning\nFatalism\u201d). Three slightly different versions of this doctrine\nare found in the Mozi, one in each of the three denunciations\nof fatalism (books 35\u201337). For brevity, we will discuss only the\nfirst\n version.[10]\n\n\nThe three fa are that statements must have a root,\na source, and a use. The \u201croot\u201d is the\nhistorical precedent and evidence provided by the deeds of the ancient\nsage kings, moral exemplars who reliably distinguished right from\nwrong correctly and whose way we thus seek to follow. The\n\u201csource\u201d is that statements must have an empirical basis;\nthey must be checked against what people see and hear. The\n\u201cuse\u201d is that when adopted as a basis for punishment and\ngovernment administration, the statement must produce benefit\n(l\u00ec) for the state, clan, and people.\n\n\nThe Mohists regularly appeal to these three criteria when\njustifying their core doctrines. When questions of existence are at\nstake, as when arguing for the existence of ghosts or the nonexistence\nof fate, they apply all three standards. In arguing against fatalism,\nfor example, they contend that (1) historical examples show that\nsecurity and order depend on government policy, not fate: the ancient\nsage kings achieved peace and security under the same social conditions\nin which the tyrants brought turmoil and danger. (2) No one has ever\nactually seen or heard fate. (3) Fatalism has detrimental social\nconsequences: If people listen to the fatalists, they will devote no\neffort to being virtuous or industrious. (Oddly, the Mohists overlook\nthe obvious fatalist rejoinders that the tyrants\u2019 failure and sages\u2019\nsuccess were predestined, that fate is not a physical object, and that\nsome people are fated to be diligent, others not.) Similarly, in\narguing for the existence of ghosts and spirits who reward the good and\npunish the wicked, the Mohists point out that (1) the sage kings all\nvenerated the ghosts and spirits; (2) countless well-known stories\nreport cases in which ghosts have been seen and heard; and (3) the\nteaching that ghosts and spirits reward the worthy and punish the\nwicked has beneficial social consequences, as fear of punishment will\ndeter people from wrongdoing.\n\n\nIn contexts where empirical support is irrelevant, only the first\nand third standards are applied. In condemning elaborate musical shows,\nfor instance, the writers contend that levying taxes to pay for\nexpensive musical instruments contradicts the deeds of the sage-kings, who\nwould tax the people only to pay for practical items such as boats and\ncarts, which benefit everyone. Grand concerts and feasts are pleasant,\nbut on balance they do not benefit the populace, since they interfere\nwith work and waste resources that could otherwise be devoted to food\nand clothing.\n\n\nHow are the three fa themselves justified? The texts that\npresent the theory do not say, but the Mohists probably view the third\nstandard, benefit to society, as an application of their moral theory,\nwhich they justify by appeal to the model of Heaven, or nature. That\nappeal they might justify in turn by independent moral criteria such\nas impartiality, benevolence, and reliability, as we suggested briefly\nin the section on\n objective standards.\n Critics who reject the Mohist normative theory thus may find\nthis fa objectionable as well. As to the second standard,\nwhat people see and hear, the Mohists offer no defense. They may have\nan inchoate theory of sense perception that explains why the second\nstandard is reliable, but there is little or no discussion of such\nissues in early Mohist texts.  The first standard reflects a shared\npattern, in the Mohists\u2019 intellectual milieu, of appealing to ancient\nsage-kings or culture heroes for authority. This habit was grounded in\nthe assumption that the ancient sage-kings were dependable ethical\nexemplars and, in some cases, that they were the originators of the\nrelevant normative practices. Such appeals are to some extent\ndefensible, as they can be thought of as an appeal to experience\n\u2014 to norms and practices that were found ethically and\npractically satisfactory by wise, fair leaders in the past. Still,\nlater Warring States thinkers will rightly question whether policies\ndeveloped under ancient social conditions remain applicable today and\nwhether we can even be sure what those policies were.\n\n\nConcerns can be raised about the vagueness of the three standards,\nthe potential for disagreement about their interpretation and\napplication, and the extent to which the Mohists apply them fairly and\nrigorously (does belief in ghosts really satisfy the second and third\nstandards?). Moreover, the Mohists seem to overlook the possibility of\nconflicts between the three, such as the likelihood that certain\npractices of the ancient sage-kings might not benefit society today.\nThe third standard probably takes priority over the others, since the\nfirst stipulates only that we find some \u201croot\u201d in the (presumably\nbenevolent) deeds of the sages, not that we imitate them slavishly, and\nsince, in a remarkable passage in Book 31 (\u201cElucidating Ghosts\u201d), Mozi\nis depicted as arguing that even if there really are no ghosts and\nspirits, we should still behave as if there are, because of the social\nbenefit that ensues.\n\n\nThe priority of the third standard is a striking feature of the Mohist\ntheory, for it entails that in at least some circumstances, they\nadvocate applying a utilitarian criterion to resolve not only\nnormative questions but descriptive ones as well. One explanation for\nthis extraordinary view is that they see all judgments \u2014\ndescriptive, prescriptive, or otherwise \u2014 as a matter of\ndistinguishing \u201cthis\u201d (shi) from\n\u201cnot\u201d (fei). They use this pair of pronouns to\nrefer to right and wrong in an extremely general sense, without\ndistinguishing between different notions of correctness and error as\nthey bear on describing, ordering, recommending, permitting, or\nchoosing, or on issues that to us fall into areas as diverse as\nscience, politics, ethics, prudence, and etiquette. We might say that\nthe Mohists are applying a very basic, primitive conception of\ncorrectness, of which truth, obligation, permissibility, and other\nnotions are species. The crucial point is probably that their main\ntheoretical focus is not descriptive truth, but the\nproper dao (way) by which to guide social and personal\nlife. This focus on dao leads them to run together the\nempirical question of whether ghosts exist with the normative question\nof whether we should act on and promulgate the teaching that they\ndo. The doctrine of the three models thus reflects the pragmatic\norientation of their thought, in particular the assumption, common to\nmany early Chinese thinkers, that the primary purpose of language and\njudgment is to guide action appropriately, rather than to describe\nfacts.\n\n\nThis pragmatic orientation led Hansen (1985, 1992) to propose that we\nshould not treat the Mohists (or other early Chinese theorists) as\naddressing the semantic issue of whether a claim is true, but the\npragmatic or normative one of whether a certain way of using words is\nappropriate. Thus the first standard, the deeds of the sage-kings,\nserves as a historical precedent of normatively correct usage, which\ncomplements the straightforwardly normative appeal to utility in the\nthird standard. Hansen suggests that in general we should avoid\ninterpreting early Chinese discussions about the proper way to\ndistinguish shi from fei as concerned with issues of\ntruth. (Hansen\u2019s view has been criticized by Graham 1989 and\nHarbsmeier 1998, among others. See Fraser 2020a for a critical discussion of both sides\u2019 positions.) Construed as the claim that the\nMohists are wholly unconcerned with or lack a concept corresponding to\nsemantic truth, Hansen\u2019s thesis is unconvincing, for classical Chinese\nnotions such as \u201cthis\u201d (shi), \u201cfitting\u201d\n(dang), and especially \u201cso\u201d (ran) play\nconceptual roles that overlap enough with that of semantic truth that\nearly Chinese thinkers cannot defensibly be said not to be\nconcerned with truth. Moreover, in recognizing the possibility that\nthere may really be no ghosts\u2014even when the statement that\nthere are purportedly satisfies the three standards\u2014the Mohists\nimplicitly recognize that a claim that is useful or satisfies our\ncriteria of correctness may yet be mistaken in the sense of falling\nshort of the \u201cfacts\u201d or \u201creality\u201d\n(qing). Arguably, they thus acknowledge a distinction between\nutility or social norms and semantic truth (though their discussion\nhere uses no word interpretable as \u201ctruth\u201d). Yet they\ncontend that even if ghosts really do not exist, the\nproper dao (way) is nevertheless to affirm that they\ndo\u2014a position that tends to support Hansen\u2019s view that they are\narguing primarily that we should promulgate and act on the teaching\nthat ghosts exist. Again, it\nis unlikely that early Mohist texts fully distinguish questions of\ndescriptive truth as a category separate from normative ethical or\npolitical questions. Their theoretical orientation tends to merge the\ntwo under the broader rubric of the proper dao by which to\ndiscriminate shi from fei. \n\n\nInterestingly, one could argue on the Mohists\u2019 own grounds that they\nshould give priority to the second standard over the other\ntwo\u2014or that they should explicitly distinguish descriptive from\nnormative issues\u2014since doing so would probably be more\nbeneficial in the long run. As rule of thumb, we probably benefit more\nby distinguishing shi from fei on empirical grounds,\nwhen relevant, rather than on the basis of historical precedent or\nshort-term utility. If ghosts and spirits indeed do not accord with\npeople\u2019s experience, for instance, then in the long run relying on\nfear of their wrath to deter crime will probably be less beneficial\nthan developing a reliable system of moral education and law\nenforcement. Also, in practice, it is unlikely that the alleged social\nbenefits could motivate doubters to sincerely act as if ghosts exist\nor to follow a moral code based partly on the existence of things they\ncannot experience.\n5. Logic and Argumentation\n\n\nBesides its role in their epistemology, the theory of the\n three fa (models)\n epitomizes the Mohists\u2019\nview of logic and argumentation. The Mohists do not investigate formal\nlogic or develop a notion of logical consequence. Rather, since they\nsee judgment as a matter of distinguishing whether something is one\nkind of thing or another, they tend to conceive of all reasoning on the\nmodel of informal, analogical inference. Particular pieces of reasoning\nin Mohist texts may be deductive, inductive, analogical, or causal. But\nthe Mohists themselves seem to regard all of these as different ways of\napplying fa to draw distinctions between similar and\ndissimilar kinds of things.\n\n\nTheir basic model of reasoning can be thought of as comprising three\nparts. (1) One or more fa (standards, models,\nor examples) are cited by which to distinguish \u201cthis\u201d\nfrom \u201cnot\u201d or to guide the use of some term, such as\nren (benevolent) or yi (morally righteous). (2) Then\nit is indicated how some object, event, or practice does or does not\n\u201cconform\u201d to or \u201ccoincide\u201d with the\nfa. (3) Accordingly, the thing in question is distinguished\nas \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cnot,\u201d as benevolent and\nrighteous or unbenevolent and unrighteous. So what we think of as the\nmajor premise in a syllogistic piece of reasoning, the Mohists\nprobably see as citing a fa. What we call a minor premise,\nthey see as a claim that something \u201cconforms\u201d to the\nfa. What we think of as drawing a conclusion, they see as\ndistinguishing whether or not something is the same kind of thing as\nthe fa. Later Mohist texts make it clear that this reasoning\nprocess is regarded as a form of analogical inference or projection,\nwhich they call \u201cextending kinds\u201d (tui lei)\n\u2014 that is, \u201cextending\u201d our judgment of what counts\nas \u201cof the same kind\u201d to include new cases. In practice,\n\u201cextending kinds\u201d amounts to taking the judgment that\nthings are \u201cof a kind\u201d (lei) in one or more\nrespects as a basis for treating them as \u201cof a kind\u201d in\nanother.\n\n\nThe three fa method of argument is one application of this\ngeneral type of argument by example or analogy. But the three\nfa are not the only standards or models the Mohists employ.\nThey regularly cite others, such as the behavior of the paradigmatic\nbenevolent person (ren ren) or filial son (xiao zi). Many\nMohist arguments proceed by establishing such a model or example and\nthen contending that Mohist doctrine conforms to it, and is thus\ncorrect. For instance, two of the main arguments for the doctrine of\ninclusive care begin by citing the model of the benevolent person, who \u201cseeks\nto promote the world\u2019s benefit and eliminate the world\u2019s harm\u201d (books\n15 and 16). The text goes on to argue that the doctrine of inclusive\ncare promotes benefit to all and so conforms to the standard set by the\nbenevolent person. Thus inclusive care is benevolent and righteous.\n\n\nA second example is the chief argument against extravagant funerals\n(Book 25). It too begins by citing the benevolent person as an ethical\nparadigm, but here the opening move is to establish, by analogy, the\nattitude of the filial son toward his parents as a model for that of\nthe benevolent person toward society: \u201cThe benevolent person\u2019s planning on behalf of\nthe world, to give an analogy, is in no respect different from the\nfilial son\u2019s planning on behalf of his parents.\u201d The filial son seeks\nto provide his parents with wealth, a large family, and social order.\nSo too has the benevolent person \u201cthree duties\u201d on behalf of society: to\nsecure wealth, a large population, and social order. Having established\nthese \u201cthree benefits\u201d as criteria for what is benevolent and righteous, the\ntext goes on to argue that the practice of lavish funerals and lengthy\nmourning yields poverty, a small population, and social turmoil, and\nthus is \u201cunbenevolent, unrighteous, and not the deed of a filial son.\u201d\n\n\nBoth the inclusive care argument and the funerals argument illustrate\nanother common Mohist rhetorical strategy: tracing the causal\nconsequences of a doctrine or policy, typically to show that Mohist\ndoctrine yields results that tally with some standard while an\nopposing doctrine does not. One text (Book 16) dubs this argument\ntechnique \u201cdeveloping two alternatives\u201d (liang er jin\nzhi).  The text identifies two contrasting moral guidelines,\n\u201cinclusive\u201d versus \u201cexclusive\u201d moral concern,\nand explores their causal consequences to see which yields results\nthat conform to the ethical standard of \u201cpromoting the world\u2019s\nbenefit and eliminating the world\u2019s harm.\u201d That alternative\n\u2014 \u201cinclusive\u201d concern, as the Mohists see it \u2014\nis therefore \u201cthis\u201d or \u201cright\u201d (shi),\nthe other \u201cnot\u201d (fei).\n6. Political Theory\n\n\nMohist political thought begins with a distinctive, fascinating\nstate of nature account of the origin and justification of the state.\nUnlike Hobbes\u2019s well-known scenario, the Mohist myth depicts violent\nsocial disorder as resulting not from individuals\u2019 untrammeled pursuit\nof self-interest in conditions of scarcity, but from disagreement about\nvalues. People\u2019s primary motivation is not self-interest, but their\ndiverse, individual conceptions of yi (morality,\nrighteousness).[11]\n Individuals all tend to do what they think\nis right; the problem is that everyone disagrees about what that is.\nSince for the Mohists yi is inherently social and shared, each\nperson condemns values different from her own as morally wrong. The\nplurality of moral standards thus leads to contention, belligerence,\nand wasted resources. For simplicity, we will quote mainly from the\nfirst of the three versions of the theory, which describes the state of\nprimal anarchy in this way:\nOur Master Mozi stated, In antiquity, when people first\narose, before there were penal codes and government, probably the\nsaying was, \u201cPeople have different norms of righteousness\n(yi).\u201d Hence for one person, one norm; for two people, two\nnorms; for ten people, ten norms\u2014the more people, the more too\nthe things they called \u2018righteous\u2019. Hence people deemed\ntheir norm right and by it deemed others\u2019 norms wrong, so in\ninteracting they deemed each other\u2014wrong. Thus, inside the\nfamily, fathers and sons, elder and younger brothers became resentful\nand scattered, unable to remain together with each other\npeacefully. The people of the world all injured each other with water,\nfire, and poison. It reached the point that, having surplus strength,\nthey couldn\u2019t use it to labor for each other; letting surplus\nresources rot, they didn\u2019t share them with each other; and concealing\ngood dao (ways), they didn\u2019t teach them to each other. The\ndisorder (luan) in the world was like that among the birds\nand beasts.  (Book 11, \u201cIdentifying Upward\u201d)\n\n\nThe root of this chaos, as the Mohists see it, is the absence of\npolitical leaders who will unify moral standards and thus put an end to\ncontention and animosity. The solution is to install a wise, virtuous\nsovereign who will establish unified moral norms and thus bring order\n(zhi, pronounced \u201cjr\u201d) to society.\nIt was understood that the people lacked government\nleaders to unify the world\u2019s norms of righteousness, and so the world\nwas in disorder. Thus the most worthy, sagely, and intelligent person\nin the world was chosen, established as the Son of Heaven, and\ncommissioned to work to unify the world\u2019s norms of righteousness\n(yi). (Book 12, \u201cIdentifying\nUpward\u201d)\n\n\nThe texts do not explain how the ruler is selected, nor, given their\ndifferences, how people manage to agree on who qualifies as the most\nworthy candidate. No social contract is envisioned. Instead, the\nsovereign\u2019s legitimacy seems to rest on an implicit, utilitarian\nconsensus that social order is a paramount value, one that can be\nachieved only by establishing centralized political leadership that\nwill impose unified moral standards. The texts pass over the question\nof how, given this shared commitment to utilitarian social order, the\npeople developed such diverse conceptions of morality in the first\nplace.\n\n\nFor the Mohists, then, the purpose of government is to achieve a\nstable social order by promulgating a unified conception of morality.\nThe central task of the state is moral education, training everyone to\nreliably conform to the same moral standards in judgment and action.\nThis is the basis for such other aims as national defense, public\nsecurity, economic management, and social welfare. The responsibility\nof the state for moral education is a distinctive theme of classical\nChinese thought, prominent in both Mohism and Confucianism and much\ncriticized in Daoist texts.\n\n\nTo assist him in unifying the world\u2019s morality, the sovereign, or\n\u201cSon of Heaven,\u201d appoints three dukes, who help him to divide the world\ninto myriad states and appoint a lord for each. These lords in\nturn appoint other officials down to the level of the district,\nvillage, or clan head, until a complete hierarchical political system\nis established. Then the work of unifying moral standards begins. The\nmain technique adopted for this task is model\n emulation.[12]\n People are ordered to \u201cidentify upward\u201d with the moral judgments\narticulated by their political superiors and not to ally together\nbelow. This moral guidance is reinforced by social and behavioral\nincentives. Those who conform and do good are praised, rewarded, and\npromoted; those who do not are censured and punished. For the Mohists,\nrewards and punishments are justified instrumentally, by their role in\nencouraging good behavior and discouraging bad.\n\n\n\nOnce the government leaders were in place, the Son of Heaven issued a\ngovernment policy to the people of the world, stating, \u201cHearing\nof good and bad, in all cases report it to your superiors. What\nsuperiors deem right (shi), all must deem right; what\nsuperiors deem wrong (fei), all must deem wrong. If superiors\ncommit errors, admonish them; if subordinates do good, recommend\nthem. Identify upward and don\u2019t align together below. This is what\nsuperiors will reward and subordinates will praise.\u201d \n \u201cOr, if you hear of good and bad but don\u2019t report it to\nsuperiors; are unable to deem right what superiors deem right; are\nunable to deem wrong what superiors deem wrong; don\u2019t admonish\nsuperiors when they commit errors; don\u2019t recommend subordinates when\nthey do good; align together below and don\u2019t identify upward, this is\nwhat superiors will punish and the people will denounce.\u201d (Book\n11, \u201cIdentifying Upward\u201d)\n\n\n\nOfficials on each level of the political hierarchy repeat a variant\nof these instructions to their subordinates, urging them to model\nthemselves on the good example set by the judgments, speech, and\nconduct of the leader on the next level up. Moral wisdom and a virtuous\ncharacter are thus crucial qualifications for political leadership.\nThus the village head was the most benevolent man in the\nvillage. The village head issued a government policy to the people of\nthe village, stating, \u201cHearing of good and bad, you must report\nit to the district head. What the district head deems right\n(shi), all must deem right; what the district head deems\nwrong (fei), all must deem wrong. Eliminate your bad\nstatements and learn the good statements of the district head;\neliminate your bad conduct and learn the good conduct of the district\nhead. Then how could the district be in disorder?! Examine what put\nthe district in order (zhi): it\u2019s just that the district head\nwas able to unify the district\u2019s norms of righteousness (yi),\nand hence the district was in order.\u201d (Book 11,\n\u201cIdentifying Upward\u201d)\n\n\nThe village head leads his village to emulate the district head, who\nin turn leads his district to emulate the lord of the state. The lords\nof states lead their people to emulate the Son of Heaven, who brings\norder to all under heaven. The Son of Heaven is still fallible,\nhowever, and so cannot be the highest moral paragon. Above him is\nHeaven (Tian), to which the people must ultimately conform. In\nthe Mohist myth, politics is not distinct from ethics and religion, and\nunlike in Hobbes, the sovereign\u2019s power is not absolute, for he must\nanswer to independent moral standards.\nIf the people of the world all identify upward with the\nSon of Heaven but don\u2019t identify upward with Heaven, then disasters\nstill will not go away. Now if in the heavens whirlwinds and bitter\nrain come again and again, this is how Heaven punishes the people for\nnot identifying upward with Heaven.  (Book 11, \u201cIdentifying\nUpward\u201d)\n\n\nA distinctive feature of the theory is that, as might be expected\nfrom the practical orientation of Mohist thought, moral education is\nregarded as akin to teaching a practical skill, such as how to speak a\nlanguage. It is accomplished primarily by emulating the judgments and\nconduct of moral exemplars, specifically how they distinguish right\n(shi) from not (fei) and act accordingly. The basic\nsource of moral guidance is thus practical training in social norms,\nwhich people are expected to master and extend to new cases. As in\nlanguage learning, social superiors teach chiefly not by dictating\nrules or instructions, but by setting an example to be emulated and\nthen praising or correcting the learner\u2019s performance. Of course,\nsometimes they will set forth explicit fa (models, rules), as\nwhen the Son of Heaven issues the original order for everyone to\nidentify upward. But moral education is not seen primarily as a matter\nof inculcating knowledge of rules, theoretical knowledge of the good,\nnor the reflective habit of testing the maxims on which one acts\nagainst the moral law. It is seen mainly as a kind of skill training.\nThe outcome of such training will be virtues, reliable dispositions to\ndistinguish right from not correctly in speech and action. As we saw\nearlier, such dispositions constitute the Mohists\u2019 basic conception of\nknowledge.\nCritical Assessment\n\n\nAspects of the Mohist political system are plausible and\npsychologically insightful. Consensus in moral judgments is indeed\nlikely to yield social order, and moral education is probably a more\neffective device for ensuring compliance with ethical standards than\nlaws and punishments alone. Most people probably are motivated to do\nwhat they think is right, and moral education may be an effective tool\nfor channeling their good intentions. Model emulation is indeed a\npowerful educational process, as any parent knows, and many of our\nvalues and judgments are in fact learned by following the example of\nadmired role models. Social coherence, peer pressure, and the approval\nof superiors are important motivational factors even for critical,\nreflective adults. The system might succeed in achieving a high degree\nof social order and stability, which would benefit everyone in society.\nThe Mohists\u2019 state of nature myth thus provides at least a prima\nfacie instrumental justification of their vision of the state.\n\n\nYet the system\u2019s authoritarian bent raises serious worries. The\nsuccess of the system depends heavily on the moral character of the\nrulers. What if their judgment is wrong or misinformed? How can they\nbe prevented from abusing their power by imposing pernicious,\nself-serving norms? The Mohists have several answers, of varying\npersuasiveness. The first is their version of the traditional Chinese\ndoctrine that the sovereign rules by the mandate of Heaven (tian\nming). Heaven will punish a corrupt ruler by causing him to be\noverthrown. Second, the sovereign and other leaders do not create the\nstandards of right and wrong, but only exemplify, teach, and enforce\nthem. Independent moral standards are provided by Mohist ethical\ntheory, to which subordinates can appeal if their leaders are mistaken\nor corrupt. These independent criteria are explicitly incorporated\ninto the third version of the political theory (Book 13), which\nspecifies that people are to promote \u201ccare and benefit\u201d to\nthe clan, state, and world, instead of merely conforming to their\nsuperiors\u2019 judgments of \u201cright\u201d and \u201cnot.\u201d\nThird, the Mohists hold that facts about moral psychology prevent\nmalicious abuse of the system, for it will collapse in the hands of a\ncorrupt ruler. People must see that leaders govern fairly and in the\ninterest of society as a whole, or they will resist the system and\n\u201cally below\u201d against their superiors. The unified moral\nnorms will disintegrate, rewards and punishments will lose their\neffectiveness, and disorder will ensue. Since this outcome is\nantithetical to everyone\u2019s interests, including the ruler\u2019s, even a\nself-interested leader has a motive to govern virtuously.\n\n\nA further worry is that the Mohist political system implements a\nkind of command morality, in which subordinates do nothing but\nmindlessly follow their leaders, who decide for them what is right and\nwrong. This concern seems unfounded, however, for the sovereign\u2019s\noriginal edict makes subordinates responsible for criticizing their\nsuperiors if they err. Clearly, those on the lower levels of the social\nhierarchy are expected to have the capacity to exercise independent\njudgment. The Mohists do tend toward a form of social, behavioral\npsychology and do not say enough about individual moral deliberation.\nBut the aim of their system is education, not passive obedience. Their\nnotion of a unified morality is two-sided. In one respect, subordinates\nmust conform to their superiors, who lead and educate them, but in\nanother, those above must conform to those below, for the system works\nonly if the people genuinely approve of their leaders\u2019 decisions.\n\n\nA third worry, to contemporary eyes probably the most serious, is that\nthe Mohists\u2019 notion of a unified morality and their conception of\nsocial order (zhi) are disturbingly totalitarian. The Mohists\nare probably right to hold that social stability requires consensus on\nat least a minimal set of moral norms \u2014 one that rules out murder and\ntheft, for instance \u2014 and that a strong government is needed to\nenforce such norms. The Mohist movement originated during an era of\nturmoil and violence, and it is possible that their conception of a\nunified morality is intended to comprise only the minimal moral\nstandards needed to preserve social harmony. But the scope of the\nnorms they envision seems much broader than this. Indeed, it\nseems to cover all value judgments whatsoever \u2014 all distinctions\nbetween \u201cright\u201d and \u201cnot\u201d (shi and fei). To the\nMohists, one suspects, even a moderate degree of diversity in how we\ndraw such distinctions counts as social, moral, and even intellectual\n\u201cdisorder\u201d (luan). The natural objection, for contemporary\nliberal readers, is that social order doesn\u2019t require total consensus\non values. It can be achieved through agreement on a limited, norms of justice, which leaves individuals free to determine other\nvalues for themselves. The Mohist system unduly restricts individual\nliberty, the objection would run, and in fact the Mohists\u2019 own moral\nideal of inclusive care and reciprocal benefit among everyone might\nbest be satisfied by a political system that ensures extensive\nindividual liberty.\n\n\nThese concerns underscore the nearly complete absence of individualism\nin Mohist thought. The Mohists presuppose a kind of communitarian\nsystem in which the fundamental concern is the interests of society as\na whole, specifically social order (zhi), economic wealth,\nand a large population. What is right for the individual is determined\nby whatever dao (way) is right for society. The salient level\nof moral choice is that of the society; individuals who desire to do\nwhat is right are expected to take for granted that they should\nconform to the dao that is best for society. The\nindividualist stance of the selfish, rational egoist does not occur to\nthe Mohists as an alternative to be addressed or refuted. Nor do they\nsee room for a distinction between public and private morality,\nbetween values that everyone must share in order to maintain a stable\nsociety and values about which individuals can disagree without\ndisrupting social harmony.\n\n\nThe Mohists devote little or no attention to the rights, liberty, or\nequality of individuals, nor even to the question of what the most\nfulfilling kind of individual life is. They simply assume that the\nbest life is one of adherence to yi (morality, duty) and thus\nof promoting overall utility. The paradigmatic individual \u2014 the\nbenevolent person (ren ren) \u2014 is one who devotes himself to\n\u201cpromoting the benefit of and eliminating harm to the world.\u201d\nLegitimate individual interests are identified through the\nindividual\u2019s role in the social project. The Mohists, like the\nConfucians, see individuals as largely constituted by the\nhierarchical, relational social roles they occupy, such as ruler or\nsubject, father or son, elder or younger brother, male or female,\nelder or youth, or member of a family or community. It is primarily as\noccupants of such roles that individuals have ethical norms to follow\nand interests to pursue.\n\n\nThis communitarian focus is a major point of contrast with Western\nsocial contract theories and utilitarian political\ntheory. Utilitarians and social contract theorists (excepting perhaps\nRousseau) typically treat individuals\u2019 interests as primary and\nconstruct social good out of individual good. The state is justified\nbecause it promotes individuals\u2019 rights and interests better than any\nalternative. For the Mohists, by contrast, the state is instrumentally\njustified because social order (zhi) is an intrinsic good,\nsought by all, and government by a hierarchy of moral leaders is\nneeded to achieve it.\n\n\nIndeed, as we might expect from their communitarianism, the Mohists\u2019\nconception of zhi (order) contains the seeds of an argument\nthat the state is intrinsically justified as well. The Mohists most\noften use zhi in a narrow sense, to refer to harmonious\nfamily and social relations. But some Mohist texts \u2014 mainly the\ntriad devoted to the doctrine of \u201cHeaven\u2019s intent\u201d \u2014 use\nzhi in a broader sense, in which it is identified with\nyi (righteousness, morality) and zheng (good governance), which\nin turn is taken to require a hierarchical political system\nadministered by the noble and wise. The texts thus imply that the\nMohist political system is not merely an instrument for producing\nutility, but is itself a component of the goods that constitute moral\nright and thus is intrinsically justified. Of course, even if we allow\nthe Mohists to identify \u201cmorality\u201d with\n\u201corder\u201d and \u201corder\u201d with their preferred form\nof political organization in this way, their line of argument\njustifies at most only the existence of the state, not the state\u2019s\npromulgation of a totalitarian, all-encompassing norms of conduct. \n\n\nMohist political theory probably strongly influenced later Warring\nStates political thinkers, such as the Confucian Xunzi and his two most\nfamous students, the realpolitik theorist Han Fei and the statesman Li\nSi, political architect of China\u2019s first empire. Yet this strand of\nauthoritarian political thought did not lack critics. The Mohist\nconception of social order (zhi), along with those of Xunzi\nand Han Fei, epitomize views that are attacked sharply in ancient\nDaoist texts such as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi. By\ncontrast, some parts of the Zhuangzi imply a relatively\nliberal political stance, on which individuals would probably be\nallowed the maximum amount of liberty compatible with avoiding social\nconflict.\nPromoting the Worthy\n\n\nAs we have seen, the theory of \u201cconforming upward\u201d argues\nfor a centralized state with a hierarchical, tightly organized\nbureaucracy.  The other prominent Mohist political doctrine,\n\u201cpromoting the worthy,\u201d contends that to ensure the\nsuccess of the state in securing wealth, a large population, and\nsocial order, appointments to the bureaucracy must be based on ethical\nmerit and professional ability. Talented commoners should be\nconsidered for office as well as those from elite backgrounds\n(particularly kinsmen of the ruler). This doctrine is partly a\nresponse to new administrative challenges arising from population\ngrowth, economic expansion, and interstate military rivalry, which\ncalled for a move beyond the traditional feudal system and the\ndevelopment of a more specialized, professional cohort of government\nofficials. It is also a reaction against nepotism and incompetence and\nan appeal for greater equality of opportunity for those of non-elite\norigin, such as the Mohists themselves.\n\n\nAbove all, however, the doctrine is an important complement to the Mohist moral education\nand incentive system, an integral part of the implementation of the unified moral norms the Mohists see as crucial to social order and political legitimacy. For the system to work, it must be perceived as applying consistent, unified norms to promote and reward the worthy while offering a fair opportunity for advancement to all. Otherwise, those below will may be unable to identify with the system and thus may see no\nreason to emulate their superiors or cooperate with the state. \nConsistent with their communitarian orientation, the Mohists\u2019 defense\nof equality of opportunity does not rest on the individualist view\nthat, other things being equal, people intrinsically deserve to be\ntreated similarly. The argument is rather that the utility of the\nstate and society is promoted by employing the most qualified\ncandidates, without regard for their social background, both because of their competence and because the state must be publicly perceived as enforcing unified, consistent standards. \n7. Ethical Theory\n\n\nEarly Mohist writings have a practical, not theoretical orientation.\nThe Mohists wrote political tracts aimed at persuading rulers,\nofficials, and gentlemen to adopt their ethical and political\ndoctrines, not abstract inquiries into ethical theory. In the course of\narguing for their doctrines, however, they present a loose yet\nsophisticated form of consequentialism, an updated version of which\nwould merit critical attention today. The leading principle \u2014 or as\nthey think of it, fa (model, standard) \u2014 of their ethics is\nthat people should have an attitude of \u201cinclusive care\u201d (jian\nai) toward others and in their interactions seek to benefit\n(l\u00ec) each other. In this way, we promote \u201cthe benefit\nof all under\n heaven.\u201d[13]\n\n\nThe Mohists do not attempt to ground all ethical values or judgments\non a single, fundamental good or principle, such as happiness or the\nmoral law. Instead, plausibly, their theory is based on a loose notion\nof human welfare comprising a plurality of basic goods. Nor do they\nsuggest that the ethical standards they propose will automatically\nresolve all moral problems, without the need for practical wisdom or\ntrade-offs between goods. But they do hold, again plausibly, that a\nreflective, self-aware moral life demands that we develop some form of\nnormative theory, some account of what practices are right and wrong\nand the reasons why.\n\n\nThe Mohist ethical theory bears a similarity to rule utilitarianism,\nbut is probably better characterized as \u201cpractice consequentialism\u201d or,\neven more appropriately, \u201cdao (way) consequentialism.\u201d For the\nMohists, as for other classical Chinese thinkers, the salient unit of\nhuman activity and the focus of ethical reflection is not individual\nacts but dao (way), a general notion referring to a way,\nstyle, or pattern of life or of performing some kind of activity.\nDao may be very broad in scope, including practices,\ninstitutions, and traditions, along with the rules, techniques, styles,\nattitudes, and dispositions associated with them. Since, as a way of\nlife, a dao includes dispositions, and thus virtues, Mohist\nconsequentialism incorporates some of the characteristics of motive\nconsequentialism.\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 primary concern, then, is not to provide a theory by\nwhich to judge whether particular acts are right or wrong, but to\nidentify \u201cthe dao (way) of the benevolent (ren) and right\n(yi).\u201d To the Mohists, the defining feature of this\ndao is that it promotes the welfare or \u201cbenefit\u201d\n(l\u00ec) of and eliminates harm to everyone in society.\n\u201cBenefit\u201d is the general standard of moral permissibility.\nThe task of the benevolent is surely to diligently seek to\npromote the benefit of the world and eliminate harm to the world and\nto take this as a model (fa) throughout the world. Does it\nbenefit people? Then do it. Does it not benefit people? Then\nstop. (Book 32, \u201cCondemning Music\u201d)\n\n\nSome passages in the texts go beyond the simple distinction between\nwhat does and does not benefit people to recognize differences in\ndegree. The extent to which an act is right or wrong is determined by\nthe degree to which it benefits or harms others: \u201cThe more one injures\nanother, the greater his unbenevolence, and the more severe the crime\u201d\n(Book 17, \u201cCondemning Aggression\u201d). Typically, however, the moral\nproblems the Mohists discuss concern general practices, such as funeral\ncustoms and warfare, not specific acts. The early texts are vague as to\nhow the standard of benefit (l\u00ec) is to be applied in\nspecific cases that do not fall neatly under one practice or\nanother.\n\n\nUnlike the classical utilitarianism of Bentham and Mill, Mohist\nconsequentialism seeks to promote not individual happiness, but a range\nof goods, many of them public or collective. The general notion of\n\u201cbenefit\u201d refers to an objective list of three sorts of goods: material wealth, a\nlarge population or family, and social order. These goods provide\nrelatively concrete moral criteria. Practices and institutions that\ntend to advance them are benevolent and righteous; those that do not are\nmalicious and wrong.\nMight it be that, supposing we model ourselves on their\nstatements, use their plans, and have rich burials with prolonged\nmourning, this can really enrich the poor, increase the few, secure\nthe endangered, and bring order to the disordered? Then this is\nbenevolent, righteous, and the task of a filial son. In planning for\nothers, it is unacceptable not to encourage it. The benevolent will\npromote it throughout the world, establish it and make the people\npraise it, and never abandon it.\nOn the other hand, suppose that, modeling ourselves on their\nstatements, using their plans, and having rich burials and prolonged\nmourning, this really cannot enrich the poor, increase the few, secure\nthe endangered, and bring order to the disordered. Then this is not\nbenevolent, not righteous, and not the task of a filially devoted\nson. In planning for others, it is unacceptable not to discourage\nit. The benevolent will seek to eliminate it from the world, abandon\nit and make people deem it wrong, and never do it. (Book 25,\n\u201cModeration in Burial\u201d)\n\n\n\nConsequentialist arguments based on one or more of these goods are\nused to justify nine of the ten core Mohist doctrines, including the\nfundamental moral principles of inclusive care and rejecting\naggression. The tenth doctrine, \u201cHeaven\u2019s intent,\u201d elucidates the\njustification for the consequentialist theory itself. (We will consider\nthis doctrine below.)\n\n\nOf the three goods, the Mohists\u2019 concept of \u201corder\u201d (zhi)\ncalls for special attention. This is a complex good comprising a\nvariety of conditions the Mohists probably regard as constitutive of\nthe good social life. From passages in which the Mohists characterize\nzhi (order) and its opposite, luan (disorder,\nturmoil), the elements of \u201corder\u201d seem to include at least four\nsorts of conditions.\n\nAll levels of society conform to unified moral standards, and\nincentives and disincentives based on these standards are administered\nfairly by virtuous leaders, as described in Mohist\n political theory.\nPeace, security, and social harmony prevail, characterized negatively as the\nabsence of crime, deceit, harassment, injury, conflict, and military\naggression.\nMembers of society manifest virtues constitutive of the proper\nperformance of their relational social roles as ruler or subject,\nfather or son, and elder or younger brother. Order obtains only when\nthe ruler is benevolent, his subjects are loyal, fathers are kind, sons\nare filial, and elder and younger brothers display brotherly love and\nrespect. (Like much ancient thought, Mohism has a sexist bias, and with\nfew exceptions the texts disregard the social roles of women.)\nCommunity members habitually engage in reciprocal assistance and\ncharity, sharing information, labor, education, and surplus goods and\naiding the destitute and unfortunate.\n\n\n\nIn summary, \u201cbenefit to the world\u201d is a general conception of\nwelfare comprising social harmony and public security; economic\nprosperity and a thriving population and family; reciprocal cooperation\namong neighbors and charity for the needy; and good social relations,\nmanifested in the exercise of virtues corresponding to the fundamental\nsocial roles.\n\n\nThis list of goods calls for several observations. First, though\nMohist texts frequently state that the duty of the benevolent person is to\npromote benefit for all of society, the characterizations of \u201cbenefit\u201d\nand \u201corder\u201d the texts give suggest that in itself the Mohist ethical\ntheory does not call for selfless altruism. Rather, what is envisioned\namounts to respect for others\u2019 lives, property, families, and political\nsovereignty and reciprocal assistance and cooperation among community\nmembers. Altruistic charity is required only in cases of special\nhardship.\n\n\nSecond, the prominence of virtues associated with fundamental social\nroles indicates that the Mohists, like the Confucians, attach great\nimportance to certain paradigmatic social relationships, probably\nseeing them as forming the basic framework of society. A flourishing\nsociety will be one in which these social roles are performed properly\nand wholeheartedly. Hence the Mohists view flourishing instances of\nthese relationships as partly constitutive of social order\n(zhi) and thus of benefit (l\u00ec). Intriguingly,\nhowever, what the texts identify as goods are not the flourishing\nrelationships themselves, but the role-specific virtues manifested by\nthe persons bound together in them. This is probably because the\nMohists see sincere, proper, fulfilling relationships as constituted by\nthe practice of these role-specific virtues. The virtues are not simply\na means to good relationships; their exercise is part of what it is to\nhave a flourishing relationship of the relevant type. A morally\nadmirable ruler-subject, father-son, or elder-younger brother bond is\njust one in which both parties exercise the relevant virtues \u2014 in\nwhich the ruler manifests benevolence and the subject loyalty, for\nexample. For the Mohists, then, social order is partly constituted by\nthe exercise of these virtues by persons in the relevant social roles.\nAccordingly, since these virtues are among the intrinsic goods of their\nethical theory, the Mohists think it is intrinsically morally admirable\nand right to be a good brother, son, father, subject, or ruler.\n\n\nIf correct, this interpretation has interesting consequences.\nDespite their commitment to the principle of \u201cinclusive care,\u201d or moral\nconcern for all, the Mohists evidently agree with the commonsense view\nthat we have a greater ethical responsibility toward those with whom we\nhave close personal relationships, and in practice we should care for\nthem first. For in order to be a kind father or filial son, for\nexample, we must give our children or parents preferential treatment\nover others. \u201cBenefit to the world\u201d includes good family relationships,\nand such relationships require special loving emotions toward and\ntreatment for family members. Contrary to a common misperception,\nMohist ethics does not advocate that we treat everyone alike, but only\nthat we have similar moral concern for everyone. (We will explore this\npoint further in the next subsection.)\n\n\nFinally, the role of virtues in Mohist ethics suggests that a suitably\nrevised version of their theory might be immune to an important\ncriticism of modern moral theories such as utilitarianism.  The\ncriticism is that in focusing on abstract principles of justification,\nmodern theories have tended to overlook the crucial role of motivation\nin the ethical life. Indeed, a theory that fails to adequately account\nfor moral motivation may be self-defeating. For example, if my motive\nin giving a friend a birthday present is not friendship and affection,\nbut a general desire to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest\nnumber, I may only succeed in disappointing and offending her, and\nthus actually reducing the amount of happiness in the world. To\nsucceed in making others happy, we typically need to be motivated not\nby the greatest happiness principle, but by attitudes such as love,\nconcern, or respect for them as individuals standing in particular\nrelationships to us. To have such attitudes, of course, is just part\nof what it is to be benevolent, loyal, kind, filial, and brotherly. So\nby including these virtues among the goods that provide its\nfundamental ethical justifications, the Mohist theory may have the\nresources to avoid an untenable split between justification and\nmotivation. It is possible that Mohist ethics may help to provide\ninsights \u2014 whether positive or negative remains to be seen\n\u2014 into how to incorporate virtues into an adequate normative\n theory.[14]\nInclusive Care\n\n\nThe ethical guideline for which the Mohists are most well known is\njian ai, sometimes translated as \u201cuniversal love\u201d but probably\nbetter rendered as \u201cinclusive care.\u201d Jian (together, jointly)\nin this context has the connotation of including everyone in society\ntogether within a whole. Like the English \u2018care\u2019,\nai (love, care) is ambiguous, since it may refer to a range of\nattitudes from strong affection to detached concern. In Mohist texts\nthe word typically seems to refer to a dispassionate concern about the\nwelfare of its object.\n\n\nInclusive care was generally not the doctrine that attracted\ncriticism from the Mohists\u2019 contemporaries. Ancient critics objected\nmostly to their frugal, austere lifestyle, opposition to music, and\nplain burial practices, which recognized no differences in social rank.\nLittle was said about their core ethical doctrines. The exception was\nMencius, who is reported to have equated inclusive care with renouncing\none\u2019s father (for this reason, he dismissed Mozi as a \u201cbeast\u201d). Many\nlater Confucian critics have followed Mencius in focusing on inclusive\ncare, maintaining that it runs counter to human nature. The doctrine\ndeserves careful attention, partly to evaluate this criticism and\npartly to draw philosophical lessons from how the Mohists apply the\nnotion of impartiality that stands at the heart of their ethics.\n\n\nIn its complete form, the Mohist doctrine is that people are to\nfollow the fa (standard, model) of \u201cinclusively caring for\neach other, and in interaction benefiting each other.\u201d As the full\nphrase suggests, the Mohists see the psychological attitude of care and\nthe beneficial behavior that results from this attitude as two sides of\na coin. They may hold that the presence of one is a sufficient\ncondition for the other. Yet an important difference between the two is\nindicated by the adverbs in the two parts of the slogan. The attitude\nof care is all-inclusive, encompassing everyone. Beneficial behavior is\nnot all-inclusive, but directed only at those with whom we actually\n interact.[15]\n In practice, then, the slogan does not\ncall for self-sacrificing altruism, but mainly for us to interact with\nothers in a reciprocally beneficial way.\n\n\nThe Mohists offer two sorts of arguments to justify inclusive care.\nOne, which we will treat shortly, is that inclusive care is\n Heaven\u2019s intention.\n The other, applied in all three of the \u201cInclusive Care\u201d texts, is by\nappeal to its good consequences.  Social harm arises from excluding\nother people, families, cities, and states from the scope of moral\nconcern. This exclusion leads to injury, crime, violence, and failure\nto practice the virtues associated with the fundamental social\nrelations. By contrast, were we to practice inclusive care, we would\neliminate these harms and promote \u201cbenefit to the world.\u201d Or so argues\nthe following passage, which interprets inclusive care as the attitude\nof being \u201cfor\u201d \u2014 that is, concerned for the sake of \u2014\nothers\u2019 interests just as we are \u201cfor\u201d our own.\n\nThat being so, then what is the reason that inclusion can replace\nexclusion? He said, \u201cSuppose people were for others\u2019 states as\nfor their state. Then who alone would deploy his state to attack\nothers\u2019 states? One would be for others as for oneself. Were people\nfor others\u2019 cities as for their city, then who alone would deploy his\ncity to assault others\u2019 cities? One would be for others as for\noneself. Were people for others\u2019 clans for their clan, then who alone\nwould deploy his clan to disorder others\u2019 clans? One would be for\nothers as for oneself. That being so, then states and cities not\nattacking and assaulting each other, people and clans not disordering\nand injuring each other, is this harm to the world? Or is it benefit\nto the world? Then we must say, It is benefit to the world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf we try to fundamentally investigate what these many benefits\nare produced from, what are they produced from? Are they produced from\ndetesting others and injuring others? Then we must say, It\u2019s not\nso. We must say, They are produced from caring about others and\nbenefiting others. If we demarcate and name caring about others and\nbenefiting others in the world, is it \u2018exclusion\u2019? Or is it\n\u2018inclusion\u2019? Then we must say it is \u2018inclusion.\u2019 That being so, then\ndoesn\u2019t this interacting by inclusion turn out to produce great\nbenefit to the world?\u201d Thus our Master Mozi said,\n\u201cInclusion is right (shi).\u201d (Book 16,\n\u201cInclusive Care\u201d)\n\n\n\nThe Mohists contrast inclusive concern with an attitude they call\n\u201cexclusion\u201d (bie, distinguishing or separating off as\n\u201cother\u201d). This attitude is not, as sometimes thought, one of\ndistinguishing differences of degree in our concern for others,\naccording to the closeness of their relation to us. Indeed, the Mohists\nnever seriously consider that\n alternative.[16]\n Rather, bie\nrefers to \u201cdespising and hurting others,\u201d excluding them from moral\nconsideration altogether. So the Mohists\u2019 case is for inclusive care as\nagainst complete disregard for others. We can grant that their\narguments establish that bie, or excluding others from all\nconcern, is morally wrong, and that inclusive care has good\nconsequences and is thus benevolent and permissible. But if their aim is to\nshow that inclusive care is obligatory, then the Mohists are posing a\nfalse dilemma. A different ethical guideline might promote \u201cbenefit to\nthe world\u201d equally or more effectively, without the stringent demand\nthat everyone be as concerned for others\u2019 interests as for their own.\nAlternatively, instead of criticizing the Mohists for trading on a\nfalse dilemma, we could say that their arguments justify inclusive\ncare, but only in the weak sense that we are obliged to be morally\nconcerned for everyone to at least some degree. The question then is,\nto what\n degree?[17]\n\n\nWhen we look to the texts for specifics of what inclusive care\ndemands, the answer is not obvious. What we find is a disparity\nbetween statements describing the attitude of inclusive care and\nconcrete examples of its practice. In theory, inclusive care is\napparently equal concern for all. The passage quoted above, for\nexample, describes it as being concerned \u201cfor others as though\nfor oneself.\u201d Another text tells us that \u201cthe fa\n(model) of inclusively caring for each other and in interaction\nbenefiting each other\u201d is \u201cto regard others\u2019 states as\nthough regarding one\u2019s state, regard others\u2019 families as though\nregarding one\u2019s family, and regard other persons as though regarding\none\u2019s person\u201d (Book 15). Adopting this as a moral fa\n(model, standard) probably involves doing two things: striving toward\nthe ideal of caring about others\u2019 lives, families, and communities to\nexactly the same degree as we care about our own, and in the meantime,\nacting as if we in fact already cared about them equally.\n\n\nIf this interpretation is correct, the doctrine is probably\nuntenable. Most human beings are naturally inclined to feel sympathy\nfor others, including strangers, and thus to care to some degree about\ntheir welfare. But it would take a heroic feat of social engineering to\nget us all to care about strangers exactly as much as we care about\nourselves and those close to us. And even with the proviso that we need\nbenefit only those with whom we actually interact, the standard of\nequal care for others would seem to carry with it impossibly high\npractical demands.\n\n\nOddly, then, the consequences and examples of inclusive care\ndescribed elsewhere in the texts suggest that the practical\nrequirements of the doctrine are not especially burdensome. Indeed, the\nspecific examples given largely conform to what many citizens of\ncontemporary Western liberal democracies would consider commonsense\nmoral decency. The actual practice of inclusive care seems to demand no more\nthan the absence of harm or hostility to others;\nvirtuous performance of our social roles as ruler, subject, father,\nson, or brother, thus contributing to the welfare of our family and\ncommunity; helping friends and neighbors in need; and assisting the\nelderly, solitary, and orphaned, who have no family to care for them.\nSince lacking a family is identified as the main reason people are\nlikely to need assistance, we can infer that the Mohists take the\nfamily to be the primary institution for meeting people\u2019s needs, and\nthat in practice inclusive care normally involves caring chiefly for\nour own family. The only individuals expected to work equally on behalf\nof everyone are government leaders, who are responsible for benefiting\nall of their subjects. So we find a gap between the description of\ninclusive care as the attitude of caring equally for everyone and the\npractical examples in the texts. The latter suggest that inclusive care\ndoes not require extensive self-sacrifice or altruism, but is mainly a\nmatter of looking after our family, neighbors, and community and not\ninterfering with others as they attempt to do the same.\n\n\nThe later Mohist texts provide an explanation of this disparity,\nthough one might dispute whether we are justified in reading the later\ndoctrine into the earlier essays. Fragments preserved in the Da\nQu, Book 44 of the Mozi, maintain that we are to care\nequally for everyone, but to benefit some people more and others less,\ndepending on the nature of their relation to us. Equal care does not\nentail equal treatment. How we treat people is determined by the notion\nof righteousness (yi), which is based on intrinsic goods such as\nsocial order (zhi), the Mohists\u2019 conception of which, as we\nsaw above, entails that we do more for those standing in close\nrelationships to us. The later Mohist view is roughly that attributed\nto a Mohist named Yi Zhi in a dialogue in the Mencius (3A:5):\n\u201cIn care, no degrees; in practice, begin from what is close.\u201d\nPractical Objections\n\n\nAs political and moral reformers, the Mohists were concerned not\nonly to justify the doctrine of inclusive care, but to persuade\neveryone in society to adopt and practice it. This aim induces a number\nof practical problems concerning moral reform and motivation, some of\nwhich are raised in a series of objections discussed in the \u201cInclusive\nCare\u201d texts. The main point of the Mohists\u2019 response to these\nobjections is that inclusive care is consistent with most people\u2019s\nexisting motives and values, so we already have the motivation needed\nto practice it.\n\n\nThe first and most obvious objection is that inclusive care is too\ndifficult. In response, the Mohists claim that in fact it is far less\ndifficult than other deeds rulers have led their people to perform in\nthe past, such as sacrificing their lives, limiting their diets, and\nwearing rough clothing. Inclusive care seems difficult only because\npeople don\u2019t recognize that it is to their long-term benefit. If, as\nMohist political theory proposes, institutions are set up to encourage\ncooperation and prevent abuse, then \u201cwithin a generation\u201d people can be\nled to practice it, because several existing lines of motivation will\nconverge to support it. First, people naturally tend to emulate admired\nand respected leaders, so if rulers encourage inclusive care, people\nwill tend to practice it. Second, rulers can institute rewards and\npunishments so that practicing inclusive care is in everyone\u2019s\nshort-term self-interest. Third, people naturally tend to reciprocate\ngood treatment, so caring for and benefiting others is in our long-term\nself-interest. The Mohists\u2019 case here is reasonably persuasive,\nprovided we keep in mind that they are focusing on the practice of\nreciprocal benefit, not the psychological attitude of equal concern,\nand that the practical demands of inclusive care are not especially\ntaxing.\n\n\nThe second objection is that inclusive care is practically\nimpossible. The reply is that it is possible, because the sage-kings\nactually practiced it. The texts cite purportedly historical examples\nto show that the sage-kings ruled fairly and impartially, performed\npublic works projects that benefited everyone, brought peace to\nsociety, and ensured that the needy were provided for. Again, these\nexamples tend to suggest that the crux of, and perhaps a sufficient\ncondition for, the practice of inclusive care is beneficial actions,\nnot the psychological attitude of equal care for everyone.\n\n\nA third challenge is that inclusive care cannot be \u201cused,\u201d\nreferring most likely to implementing it as a policy people can\nfollow. (Generating benefits when put into use as a social policy\nis the third of the three models the Mohists\npropose to evaluate statements or teachings.) The Mohists present a\npair of hypothetical scenarios intended to show that people committed\nto caring for their own and their family\u2019s welfare would prefer\ninclusive care as a policy to be followed by those around them, since\nwe would all prefer to live under the rule of or entrust the care of\nour family to someone who practices it. That is, acting from an\nexisting motive that nearly all people share\u2014protecting one\u2019s\nown and one\u2019s family\u2019s welfare\u2014people select inclusive care as a\ndao to be followed by those around them, and therefore it\nindeed \u201ccan be used.\u201d The Mohists criticize opponents who\nraise this objection for a practical contradiction: In their\nstatements, they reject inclusive care, but in practice, they would\nselect it as a social dao, just as the people in the\nhypothetical scenarios do. Interestingly, this criticism works only\nbecause the writers assume that the issue at hand is the choice of a\ndao (way), a universal, social system of norms of conduct. They seem to\nassume that all of our choices and actions issue from such norms. Thus they hold that in preferring inclusive care in others, we\ncommit ourselves to it as a code to be observed by all, including\nourselves. To them, the stance of a rational egoist who prefers that\neveryone else, but not he, practice the dao is\nincoherent.\n\n\nThe last objection considered is that inclusive care may fail to\nbenefit one\u2019s parents and thus interfere with filial piety. The\nMohists\u2019 response is that a filial son would desire that others care\nabout and benefit his parents. An effective way to achieve this end,\nthey contend, is by caring for and benefiting others\u2019 parents, leading\nothers to reciprocate in kind. (Here, as in their reply to the first\nobjection, the Mohists make the plausible assumption that humans have a\nnatural tendency toward reciprocity.) Psychologically, then, inclusive\ncare is consistent with our existing motivation to care for our\nparents, while morally it is justified as an indirect means of\nbenefiting them.\n\n\nBecause these arguments are directed at opponents who resist the\nmore optimistic aspects of Mohist moral psychology, they appeal mainly\nto self-interest and the interest of one\u2019s in-group, motives the\nwriters assume are reliably shared by everyone. Other Mohist texts\npresent a fuller picture of moral motivation. Its central premises are\nthat people tend to be strongly committed to doing what they think is\nright, they tend to desire the basic goods that follow from the\npractice of inclusive care, they tend to follow political leadership\nand seek peer approval, and with the exception of miscreants\nresponsible for social disorder, they tend to seek not only their own\nself-interest but the interest of their family and community. Hence\nmost people already possess strong moral motivation and some degree of\nempathy for others. Moreover, because they desire to be good, or\nren (benevolent), they are prepared to accept the force of\nthe better normative reason (gu, also \u201ccause,\u201d\n\u201cbasis\u201d) in discussion.\nBenevolent people inform each other of the patterns by\nwhich they select or reject, deem right or deem wrong. Those who lack\na reason follow those who have a reason. Those who don\u2019t know\nsomething follow those who have knowledge. Lacking remarks to offer in\ntheir defense, they surely submit; seeing good, they surely reform.\n(Book 39, \u201cCondemning Confucianism\u201d)\n\n\nWhat is needed to get most people to act morally, then, is mainly\neducation and normative arguments, which will help them to correctly\nidentify what is right. Such arguments will convince them to guide\ntheir actions by the fa (model) of \u201cregarding others as though\nregarding oneself,\u201d and this fa will in turn strengthen the\nhabit of acting out of sympathy for others\u2019 interests.\nJustification and the Role of Heaven\n\n\nThe Mohists justify their consequentialist ethics by appeal to the\nintention of Heaven (Tian), which they believe provides an\nobjective criterion of morality. Among their reasons for obeying\nHeaven\u2019s intention are gratitude for its gifts, fear of punishment,\nand their belief that it is the noblest, wisest moral agent in the\ncosmos.  Here we will examine this third, philosophically more\ninteresting rationale, setting aside for the moment Heaven\u2019s role as\nan object of\n religious worship\n and enforcer of moral\norder.\n\n\nThe crux of the Mohists\u2019 appeal to Heaven is that as the highest,\nwisest moral agent, Heaven conducts itself in a way (a dao)\nthat unfailingly sets an example of correct ethical norms. Its\nintentions are consistently or reliably benevolent and righteous. To obtain an\nobjective criterion of moral right and wrong, then, we can observe\nHeaven\u2019s conduct and notice the norms it is committed to and\nenforces. Heaven\u2019s intention can serve as a fundamental\nethical fa (model, standard), one that is clear and easy for\nanyone to apply, just as a craftsman\u2019s measuring tools are.\n\n \n\nThus our Master Mozi\u2019s having Heaven\u2019s intention, to give an analogy,\nis no different from the wheelwright\u2019s having a compass or the\ncarpenter\u2019s having a set square.... Above, he uses it to measure how\nthe kings, dukes, and great men of the world administer the penal\ncodes and government; below, he uses it to gauge how the myriad people\nof the world engage in writings and studies and present statements and\ndiscussions. Observe their conduct; if it follows Heaven\u2019s intention,\ncall it good intentions and conduct; if it opposes Heaven\u2019s intention,\ncall it bad intentions and conduct.  Observe their statements and\ndiscussions; if they follow Heaven\u2019s intention, call them good\nstatements and discussions; if they oppose Heaven\u2019s intention, call\nthem bad statements and discussions. Observe their penal codes and\ngovernment; if they follow Heaven\u2019s intention, call them good penal\ncodes and government; if they oppose Heaven\u2019s intention, call them bad\npenal codes and government. So he sets this up as a fa\n(model), establishes this as a standard, and uses it to measure the\nbenevolence (ren) and unbenevolence of the kings, dukes,\ngreat men, secretaries, and ministers in the world, and, to give an\nanalogy, it is like dividing black from white.\n\n\nThus our Master Mozi said, \u201cNow the kings, dukes, great men, officers,\nand gentlemen of the world, if, within, they really desire to follow the\ndao (way), benefit the people, and fundamentally examine the\nroot of benevolence (ren) and righteousness (yi), then\nit\u2019s unacceptable not to follow Heaven\u2019s intention. Following Heaven\u2019s\nintention is the fa (model) of righteousness (yi).\u201d (Book 27,\n\u201cHeaven\u2019s Intent\u201d)\n\n\n\nThough the Mohists themselves do not draw the distinction, we can\nidentify two interrelated roles that Heaven\u2019s intention plays. On the\none hand, it serves as a criterion of what is morally righteous and thus a\nbasis for ethical justification. In the passage above, for example, it\nis used to evaluate whether actions, statements, and practices are\nmorally right. On the other hand, it also serves as a practical moral\nguideline. In practice, we can test particular actions or types of\nconduct against it to determine how to proceed. \u201cHaving taken Heaven as\nfa, we must measure our movements and conduct against Heaven.\nWhat Heaven desires, do it; what Heaven does not desire, stop\u201d (Book 4,\n\u201cModels and Standards\u201d).\n\n\nWhy is Heaven\u2019s intention a reliable ethical standard? The Mohists\ngive a number of moral reasons. As we saw\n earlier,\n they argue that unlike any particular human role model or cultural or\nhistorical standard, Heaven is reliably ren (benevolent), because\nit is impartial, benevolent, and enduring. They further claim that if\nwe examine \u201cthat from which righteousness (yi) issues,\u201d we find\nthat \u201crighteousness issues from Heaven\u201d (Book 27, \u201cHeaven\u2019s\nIntent\u201d). They support this conclusion by running through a quick\ncircle of extensional\nequivalences. Righteousness is good government, because a necessary and\nsufficient condition for social order is that righteousness obtain in the\nworld. In good government, the noble and knowledgeable govern the ignorant and\ncommon. Moral righteousness thus \u201cissues from\u201d the noble and knowledgeable, in\nthat it obtains only in circumstances in which they rule. Heaven is\nthe noblest and most knowledgeable, so righteousness issues from it.\n\n\nTo follow the right dao, then, we can emulate Heaven and\nlearn to conform to the norms it follows. Of course, we are not\ndeities and so cannot imitate Heaven\u2019s actions directly. But we can\nobserve its actions, deduce its desires and intentions, and then\nconform to those.  And what we find is that Heaven desires that people\ncare for and benefit each other (Book 4). It desires that righteousness\n(yi) prevail, and thus desires life, wealth, and social order\nfor people (Book 26). Indeed, it desires all of the goods posited by\nMohist ethical theory, including peace and security, social harmony and\ncooperation, economic sufficiency, and the practice of the virtues\nassociated with the key social roles (Book 27). We know Heaven desires\nthese things because its actions show that it cares for and benefits\neveryone without discrimination. It is benevolent, providing all\npeople with life, sustenance, and natural resources. It enforces\nmorality by avenging crimes against the innocent. It rewarded the six\nancient sage-kings, who cared for and benefited the people, and\npunished the four tyrants, who despised and hurt the people. It\npossesses all the people of the world as a ruler possesses his\nsubjects, and thus it cares about everyone, just as a ruler cares\nabout his subjects.\n In short, Heaven itself desires the goods the Mohist ethical\ntheory adopts as criteria of what is morally right. That theory is\nthus correct, the Mohists think, because it captures the ethical norms\nfollowed by Heaven, the wise, impartial, and benevolent agent at the\napex of the cosmic political hierarchy, to whom all people should\n\u201cidentifying upward\u201d.\n\n\nThis appeal to a conjunction religious beliefs about Heaven and the political\ndoctrine of \u201cidentifying upward\u201d has led some scholars to suggest that\nMohist ethics might ultimately be a form of divine command theory.\nDrawing mainly on the claim that Heaven is \u201cthat from which righteousness\nissues,\u201d for instance, Soles (1999) contends that for the Mohists,\n\u201cWhat makes Heaven\u2019s commands right is the mere fact that Heaven\ncommands them\u201d (p. 46). Without question, a few passages in the texts\nurge people to conform to moral norms specifically because doing so is\nHeaven\u2019s intention, and the doctrine that obedience to Heaven brings\nreward and disobedience punishment is redolent of a divine command theory.\nMoreover, these religious beliefs are crucial to the Mohist worldview,\nand an inaccurate, distorted picture of their thought results if we\nneglect them.\n\n\nStill, there are strong grounds for denying that the Mohists hold a\ndivine command theory. First, the texts never analyze, define, or\nexplain the notion of righteousness (yi) in terms of Heaven\u2019s\nintention. To the contrary, all four of the texts about Heaven\u2019s\nintention assign it an epistemic role, as a test or criterion by which\nto distinguish right from wrong. They argue that Heaven\u2019s intention\ncan be taken as a model (fa) or canon (jing) of\nrighteousness (yi). This claim asserts an extensional\nequivalence, not an analysis, definition, or exposition. The point is\nthat Heaven\u2019s intention and \u2018righteousness\u2019 distinguish\nthe same things, not that what is righteous is so because it is\nHeaven\u2019s intention. Even the claim that righteousness \u201cissues\nfrom\u201d Heaven need not be read as implying anything stronger than\nthat a righteous society can exist only when people all follow the\nmodel or example set by Heaven\u2019s intentions and conduct.\n\n\nSecond, and more important, the Mohists give independent moral reasons\nto support their claim that Heaven\u2019s intention is a reliable moral\nguide. Their grounds are not simply the religious belief that Heaven\nmust be obeyed because it is a deity or because it punishes\ndisobedience. Rather, they argue that Heaven is a guide to what is\nbenevolent and righteous because it is a supremely noble, wise,\nimpartial, benevolent, and reliable agent. Their reasons apply\nevaluative concepts of benevolence, righteousness, good government,\nand social order (zhi) that are independent of Heaven\u2019s\nintention. To support their contention that Heaven desires what is\nrighteous (yi), for example, they characterize righteousness\nas comprising life, wealth, and order and claim that Heaven desires\nthese. Phrased in terms of the Euthyphro dilemma, their\nstance is fairly clear: What is righteous is not righteous\nbecause Heaven intends it.  Rather, Heaven intends it because\nit is righteous. Heaven\u2019s conduct and intentions exemplify moral norms\nthat hold independently of its intent.\n\n\nGiven how the Mohists\u2019 conception of Heaven fits into the framework of\ntheir ethics, the appeal to Heaven to justify and explicate their\nnormative stance risks circularity. Their conception of Heaven is in\neffect that of a morally ideal sovereign, whom they characterize as\nwise or all-knowing, all-embracing, benevolent, generous, and\nimpartial. The Mohists imply that the correct moral norms are those\nthat such an agent would follow or intend that human beings\nfollow. The problem is that the characteristics they build into this\nconception of an ideal agent are just those they already hold should\nbe articulated by a satisfactory ethical theory, such as impartial,\nbenevolent concern for the welfare of all. Arguably, then, the appeal\nto Heaven does not justify Mohist ethics so much as simply illustrate\nor articulate it.  \n\n\nA potential problem with the appeal to Heaven arises from the way the\nMohists\u2019 concept of a fa (model) runs together the notions of\na criterion of righteousness, a practical guideline, and a role\nmodel. The idea of objectively justifying our practices and standards\nof conduct by appeal to the abstract, decontextualized stance of an\nideally impartial and benevolent agent is at least prima\nfacie plausible. But the Mohist theory risks confusing this with\nthe much less plausible idea that in practice we should guide our\nconduct by emulating a benevolent deity who cares impartially for\nall. In effect, they conflate the idea of seeking an impartial\njustification for our actions, which are taken from within a\nparticular, and thus necessarily partial, context, with that of\nadopting an impartial point of view, but one that, impossibly, is\nabstracted from any particular context. In some contexts, Mohist\narguments are careful to avoid conflating these points, but in others\nthey verge on identifying the attitudes of the benevolent person with\nthose of Heaven itself. \nCritical Assessment\n\n\nThe basic structure of the Mohist ethical theory is simple yet\nprofound. At its base stands the notion of impartial concern for the\nbenefit of all, as epitomized by the point of view of Heaven, an\nideally benevolent, impartial agent who cares equally about everyone\u2019s\nwelfare. From this foundation, the Mohists develop a consequentialist\naccount of the benevolent (ren) and the righteous (yi) in\nterms of a set of goods that constitute benefit or welfare. Community\npractices are justified by their instrumental value in promoting the\nwelfare of all. The theory recognizes that individuals exist within a\nweb of social relations, which partly define their identities and\nduties, and that strong social relationships are a crucial part of\nhuman welfare. It assigns virtues a role in guiding action and in\nconstituting good social relations. The theory is loosely formulated,\ninelegantly expressed, and supported by arguments that to modern\nreaders may in places seem rudimentary or simplistic. Still, coming at\nthe beginning of the philosophical discourse of ancient China, it\nrepresents a quantum leap in theory construction and argumentation in\ncomparison to earlier Confucian discourse. Moreover, the general type\nof consequentialist approach it lays out remains a well-regarded\noption in ethical theory today.\n\n\nThe strong point of the Mohist theory is that it grounds moral\nrighteousness (yi) on two key notions, impartiality and human\nwelfare. Yet the major defects of Mohist ethical thought lie precisely\nin how these ideas are handled. The locus of impartiality is\nmisplaced, and the conception of human welfare is too narrow. \n\n\nThe problem with the Mohists\u2019 treatment of impartiality is that they\nlocate it in the attitude of moral concern, instead of in the\njustification for our actions or practices. Their approach to finding\nobjective, impartial ethical norms is to advocate that each individual\nbe impartially motivated by equal concern for all. We are to conform\nto the standard of \u201cregarding others as though regarding oneself\u201d or\nto model ourselves on the God\u2019s-eye stance of Heaven. But in practice\nwe cannot possibly act for all others as though acting for ourselves,\nand unlike Heaven, we are rarely in a position to act on behalf of\neveryone. So the Mohists fail to articulate a conception of impartiality that\nis viable in practice. Impartial, equal concern cannot defensibly be\nadvocated as the ideal ethical motivation of individual agents.\n\n\nOne plausible response to this problem would be to develop a form of\nrule or practice consequentialism. The Mohists could apply their basic\nstandard of righteousness \u2014 what \u201cpromotes benefit to and eliminates harm from\nthe world\u201d \u2014 as a criterion by which to justify a social dao\n(way), or set of practices and norms, that best promotes everyone\u2019s\nwelfare. These impartially justified practices and norms could then\nguide action in particular situations. In practice, of course, the\nMohists adopt roughly just this approach. They advocate equal care for all,\nbut allow that how we actually treat others will vary depending on our\nrelation to them. According to the later Mohist texts, where this\ndoctrine of equal care but different treatment is presented explicitly,\nour treatment of others will be guided by standards of yi\n(righteousness), which probably articulate practices the Mohists think\nbest promote the welfare of everyone in society.\n\n\nThe hitch is that such a practice-consequentialist approach is\nunlikely to support the Mohist doctrine of equal care for all.\nPresumably, in line with the compelling points in the Mohists\u2019\narguments, the norms and practices justified by this approach would\nlead individuals to adopt the attitude of inclusive care, and\nso to include everyone within the scope of their moral concern. But the\nconsequentialist standard of promoting everyone\u2019s welfare probably\nwould not demand that each of us realize the attitude of equal\ncare, or equal and impartial concern for everyone. Rather, both\ntreatment and care would probably be allowed to vary with relationship\nand context, provided that a basic minimum standard of concern \u2014\nperhaps only non-interference, basic courtesy, and help in emergencies\n\u2014 were met for strangers to whom we have no special relation.\n\n\nTo this, the Mohists might respond that we should still practice\nequal care, because it is the way of the sage-kings and the intention\nof Heaven, the highest moral exemplar, and its practice produces great\nbenefit for the world. The Mohists recognize no distinction between\nobligation and supererogation, and perhaps their religious beliefs\nconvince them that the best life is one that most fully complies with\nHeaven\u2019s desire that we care for and benefit others. Also, as the\nZhuangzi passage\n quoted earlier\n attests,\nmany Mohists particularly revered and emulated Yu, the most\nself-sacrificing and altruistic of the sage-kings.\n\n\nBut it is probably false that the general practice of equal care\nwould yield the most benefit for the world. Setting aside emergencies\nand the special duties of highly demanding jobs such as sage-king, it is likely that the\nMohists\u2019 own basic goods are best promoted not only by treating those\nclosest to us differently from others, but by caring about them more,\ntoo. The idea of disconnecting care from treatment is counterintuitive.\nIn particular, it seems unlikely that we could genuinely exercise the\nvirtues associated with the key social relations without also caring\nmore about the people to whom we are related. It is hard to envision\nsomeone really being a loyal minister or kind father without also\ncaring more about his ruler or children than a stranger\u2019s. Moreover,\ntremendous practical problems would be involved in training everyone to\ncare equally for all, requiring a vast expenditure of effort and wealth\non ends that could be achieved just as well by the practice of\ninclusive, but unequal care.\n\n\nThe second major defect of Mohist ethical thought is its excessively\nnarrow, material conception of human welfare or benefit\n(l\u00ec), which comprises little more than material\nwell-being and peaceful, harmonious social relations. With a handful\nof exceptions, Mohist ethics dismisses aesthetic value and overlooks\nthe psychophysical fulfillment achieved through the exercise of\nacquired skills\u2014goods that are central to the Confucian and\nDaoist ways of life. Little attention is devoted to individual\nhappiness or fulfillment or to articulating a conception of\nwell-rounded human excellence. Moreover, the Mohist conception of\nmorality can at times seem aggressively one-sided and burdensome. One\npassage in the Mozi presents a conception of ideal human\nflourishing as a life of complete devotion to moral duty:\nWhen silent, ponder; when speaking, instruct; when acting,\nwork. Make these three alternate and surely you will be a sage. You\nmust eliminate happiness and eliminate anger, eliminate joy and\neliminate sorrow, eliminate fondness and eliminate dislike, and use\nbenevolence and righteousness. Your hands, feet, mouth, nose, and ears\nundertaking righteousness, surely you will be a sage. (Book 47,\n\u201cValuing Righteousness\u201d)\n\n\nTheir thin conception of human welfare may be one reason some\nMohists saw a life of altruistic self-sacrifice as the way of the\nsages. If satisfying basic material needs is sufficient to secure our\nwelfare, then once those needs are met, we have little\nworthwhile to do but help others.\n\n\nTo be fair, however, the Mohists\u2019 minimalist conception of welfare may\nhave been a reasonable response to the difficult social and economic\ncircumstances in which they lived, particularly as representatives of\nsub-elite social classes. Their texts imply an environment in which\nhardship due to poverty, poor harvests, cold, hunger, or war is never\nfar off. So naturally they focus on the basic goods needed for\nphysical and economic security: a stable government, material wealth,\nstrong family bonds, and charity to neighbors in need. Mohism is in\neffect a refugee ethic, born from hard times, that values material\nwelfare and parsimony above all else. Their doctrine of \u201cModeration in\nUse\u201d advocates eliminating all luxuries\u2014particularly\nthose of the aristocracy\u2014and reducing consumption of food,\nclothing, and housing to the minimum level needed for basic\ncomfort. If conditions are really as harsh as the Mohists imply\n\u2014 a premise that Xunzi, a friend of the aristocracy, will deny\n\u2014 then their narrow focus is defensible, and in arguing that\nelaborate musical shows and burial practices are wasteful and immoral,\nfor instance, they are on firm ground. The problem is that the Mohists\nnever reflect on the possibility that in more prosperous and\negalitarian conditions, music and other cultural activities could be\nvaluable contributions to human well-being.\n\n\nIf Mohist ethics faces a problem of moral motivation, it is probably\nbecause their impoverished conception of human welfare excludes too\nmuch that people genuinely value. When the Zhuangzi criticizes\nthe Mohists for \u201cgoing against the heart of all under heaven,\u201d it is\nnot referring to inclusive care, but to their severe, frugal lifestyle.\nAs Xunzi said, \u201cMozi was blinkered by utility and did not recognize adornment\u201d\n(Xunzi, Book 21, \u201cDispelling Blindness\u201d).\n8. Religion\n\n\nThe Mohists\u2019 religious beliefs play a central part in their\nthought, providing a foundation for their view that an objective\nmoral code obtains in the cosmos and thus perhaps much of the\nmotivation for their way of life. Though brief, their descriptions of\ntheir beliefs and practices provide a rare direct glimpse into the\nreligion of one portion of the sub-elite populace of ancient China.\n\n\nLike much traditional Chinese religious thought, Mohist beliefs are in\neffect an extension of the social and political system to incorporate\nrelations with a personified conception of nature and various\nsentient, intelligent entities with whom humans share the natural\nworld. The Zhou dynasty nature deity Tian (Heaven, nature,\nthe sky) is the counterpart (and superior) in this extended system of\nthe human sovereign. Other elements include the Shang dynasty high\ngod di and a variety of ghosts and spirits, from those of\ndeceased human ancestors to those of natural, geographical features\nsuch as mountains and rivers. The various beings that constitute this\npersonified natural setting enforce morality by rewarding the worthy\nand punishing the wicked.  Humans view them as objects of respect,\ngratitude, and fear, sacrificing animals and offering millet and wine\nto feed and placate them and to seek their blessings.\n\n\nAt the pinnacle of the cosmic sociopolitical hierarchy stands Tian.\nTian created humans, set the sun, moon, and stars on their\nregular paths through the sky, fashioned the landscape, and\nestablished the four seasons and weather so that crops could grow. It\nprovides people with the sustenance and natural resources by which\nthey live. It established government to watch over people and\nadminister rewards and punishments. All people are its subjects and\nowe it veneration and gratitude for its many gifts. It reigns\nvirtuously over the human emperor \u2014 the \u201cSon of\nTian\u201d \u2014 as a kind of cosmic sovereign and all-seeing,\nall-powerful policeman. As the highest, noblest, and wisest moral\nagent, it embodies correct moral norms and thus serves as a role model\nby which to judge the morality of practices and actions.\n\n\nIt is often convenient to translate Tian as \u201cHeaven,\u201d a word\nthat similarly refers to both the sky and a deity. Yet Tian\nis dissimilar from the Judeo-Christian conception of God or Heaven in\nseveral ways. Tian does not exist outside of time, space, or\nnature, nor is it considered perfect or unchanging. It is not the\ncreator of nature, but rather is nature, or part\nthereof. (Combined with \u2018di\u2019 (earth), the word\n\u2018tian\u2019 forms the compound\n\u2018tian-di\u2019 (sky-and-earth), which refers to the\nnatural world.) Tian is personified as a sociopolitical\nauthority, but it is considerably less anthropomorphic than the\nJudeo-Christian God. It has desires and intentions, and it speaks, but\nonly as if thinking to itself, not directly to humans. Tian\ngenerally does not inform humans of its desires or intentions by\nrevelation (though in crises it may dispatch a spirit envoy, such as a\nfantastic talking bird). Rather, we must discern them for ourselves by\nobserving its behavior. Humans sacrifice to Tian, but usually\ndo not pray to it or address it directly. However, we do have an\nimplicit agreement with\nTian that if we conform to its desires, it will reward us in\nturn. Specifically, care for and benefit to others will be rewarded,\ncontempt and injury punished.\n\n\nThe Mohists have no concept of religious salvation or of another realm\nto which we go after death. (Tian is of course not a\ntranscendent place or realm but an embodiment of nature.) When people die,\nthey become ghosts, which exist within the natural world. Unlike in\nChristianity, people are not rewarded or punished in the next world\nfor their deeds in this one. Rather, the Mohists insist that\nTian and the ghosts will reward and punish people while they\nare alive. As one might expect, this belief was strongly challenged by\nthe Mohists\u2019 opponents, who pointed out instances in which it is at\nodds with everyday experience. Unfortunately, the Mohist responses to\nthese criticisms in the end amount mainly to ad hoc excuses.\n\n\nDespite the genuine tone of reverence in the Mohists\u2019 descriptions of\nTian, some readers find Mohist religion to lack the sense of\nholiness, religious awe, and spiritual transcendence that contemporary\nWesterners customarily associate with religion, particularly in\ncontrast with Confucian appreciation of the beauty of ritual or Daoist\nwonder at the mysteries of nature. The mundane tone of their religious\nthought is perhaps partly due to the Mohists\u2019 general disregard of\naesthetic and cultural value. Yet it would be indefensibly parochial\nto expect them to conform to a modern Westerner\u2019s conception of\nreligiosity, since the comparatively mundane character of Mohist\nreligion is typical of much traditional Chinese folk religion. In\nfact, the Mohists are deeply dedicated to maintaining harmonious,\nreverential relations with Tian, ancestral ghosts, and nature\nspirits, and both their rhetoric and practices devote much energy to\nreligious veneration. \n9. Historical Influence and Decline\n\n\nThe Mohists can be credited with a number of significant philosophical\nachievements, including China\u2019s first ethical and political theories\nand history\u2019s earliest form of consequentialism.  They strive for but\ndo not quite achieve a viable account of an impartial, objectively\njustified moral code. Both their insights and their errors are of\ngreat philosophical interest. Their ethical theory has important\ndefects, but one of its major strengths is that these could probably\nbe remedied without abandoning the basic structure of the theory.\n\n\nMohism never achieved a position of dominance or orthodoxy, but at\nits peak in the 4th and 3rd centuries BCE, no school was more\ninfluential. This status is attested by no less an authority than\nMencius, who lamented that \u201cthe statements of Mo Di and Yang Zhu\n[another rival thinker] fill the world,\u201d and by the attention Xunzi\ndevotes to refuting Mohist economic doctrines. Though their importance\nis routinely slighted in Confucian-biased accounts of Chinese thought,\nthe Mohists articulated much of the theoretical framework of early\nChinese epistemology, logic, political theory, and ethics. Their ideas\nwere a crucial stimulus for Mencius, Xunzi, the Daoists, and the\nso-called \u201clegalist\u201d political thinkers, all of whom either borrowed\nMohist ideas or developed their own views partly in reaction to them.\nOne sign of the Mohists\u2019 status is that their shared critics typically\npaired them with the Confucians (Ru) as a bloc, referring to\nthe two as Ru-Mo, the two \u201cmoralizing\u201d schools devoted to\nren (benevolence) and yi (righteousness). Confucianism owes an\nunacknowledged debt to Mohism for its notion of comprehensive moral\nconcern, as reflected, for instance, in Mencius\u2019s doctrine of extending\nour natural concern for kin so that it reaches everyone. The phrase\n\u201cinclusive care\u201d begins to appear in Confucian texts toward the end of\nthe Warring States era \u2014 a late passage in the Xunzi refers\nto \u201ccomprehensive benefit and inclusive care\u201d (Book 25) \u2014 and by the\nHan dynasty, we find the Confucian Gongsun Hong explaining the virtue\nof ren (benevolence) in explicitly Mohist terms, as \u201cextending\nbenefit and eliminating harm, inclusively caring without partiality\u201d\n(Han Shu, Vol.\n 58).[18]\n\n\nWith few exceptions, Chinese thought after the Han turned away from\nthe Mohists\u2019 epistemological, semantic, and logical interests to focus\non moral metaphysics and moral psychology, thus passing over what might\nhave been their chief legacy. Hence Mohism is sometimes depicted as a\nsplinter movement not genuinely representative of the Chinese\nphilosophical tradition. This view is false and anachronistic, however.\nMuch of what is plausible or intriguing in Mohist thought directly\nreflects concepts, assumptions, and problems that were elements of\nmainstream Warring States intellectual discourse.\n\n\nFollowing the unification of China under the Qin dynasty\n(221\u2013207 BCE), the Mohist movement declined, eventually\nvanishing altogether by the middle of the Western Han (206\nBCE\u201324 CE). After Confucianism won imperial favor in 136\nBCE, Confucius gradually came to be venerated as China\u2019s greatest\nsage. Mozi and his school fell into neglect and obscurity, their texts\nlargely unread. Centuries later, the bulk of the Mozi was\nnearly lost to history, surviving only because it had been copied into\na massive collection of Daoist scripture. Interest in Mohism revived\nonly late in the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911 CE), when scholars,\nstimulated partly by contact with the West, went looking for untapped\nintellectual resources in their own tradition, particularly materials\nrelated to science and logic.\n\n\nA number of factors can be cited to explain Mohism\u2019s decline and\ndisappearance. Graham is probably right, for instance, to suggest that\nafter the Qin unification, the Mohists lost the political influence\nthey had exerted as expert craftsmen and defense specialists who\nhelped smaller states survive during the Warring States era (1989,\np. 34). But the major factor is probably that as a social and\nphilosophical movement, Mohism gradually collapsed into\nirrelevance. By the middle of the former Han dynasty, the more\nappealing aspects of Mohist thought were all shared with rival\nschools. Their core ethical doctrines had largely been absorbed into\nConfucianism, though in a modified and unsystematic form. Key features\nof their political philosophy were probably shared with most other\npolitical thinkers, and their trademark opposition to warfare had been\nrendered effectively redundant by unification. The philosophy of\nlanguage, epistemology, metaphysics, and science of\nthe later\n Mohist Canons\n were recorded in difficult, dense texts\nthat would have been nearly unintelligible to most readers (and that\nin any case quickly became corrupt). What remained as distinctively\nMohist was a package of harsh, unappealing economic and cultural\nviews, such as their obsession with parsimony and their rejection of\nmusic and ritual. Compared with the classical learning and rituals of\nthe Confucians, the speculative metaphysics of Yin-Yang thinkers, and\nthe romantic nature mysticism and literary sophistication of the\nDaoists, Mohism offered little to attract adherents, especially\npolitically powerful ones.\n\n\nThe Mohists helped to articulate much of the framework of classical\nChinese philosophical discourse while advocating a way of life so at\nodds with most people\u2019s conception of the good life that it stood\nlittle chance of ever inspiring a wide following. The school had\nalways shown undue enthusiasm for radical, simplistic\npositions. Unwilling or unable to modify their doctrines or to develop\nnew positions in response to their changing social and intellectual\nsetting, the Mohists probably died out in the imperial era because\ntheir Warring States reformist social and political platform had\nbecome obsolete.\n", "bibliography": {"categories": ["Works cited in the article", "Translations of the <em>Mozi:</em>", "General surveys of classical Chinese thought", "Other selected works in English relevant to Mohism"], "cat_ref_text": {"Works cited in the article": ["</h3>\n<ul class=\"hanging\">", "Brooks, A.
