    "main_text": "Defining Culture || Culture-as-dialogue\n1.3 Culture-as-dialogue\n\nThe latter objection\u2014that a so-called culture is the product of\nsome but not all of its members leads some scholars to rearticulate\nculture in terms of the ways in which it is constructed via dialogue\namong members and their engagement with each other. The purpose of\nemphasizing that a culture\u2019s members are the source of its main\npractices, values and norms, is to emphasize that a culture is not\n\u201cgiven\u201d to its members from above, as a fixed and\nunalterable entity. Rather, members of a culture are, in a fundamental\nway, its authors. Here is James Tully explaining this: cultures\nare\n\n\ncontinuously contested, imagined and reimagined, transformed and\nnegotiated, both by their members and through their interactions with\nothers. (Tully 1995: 11)\n\n\nSeyla Benhabib similarly emphasizes the narrative aspect of\ncultures, noting that insiders\n\n\nexperience their traditions, stories, rituals and symbols, tools, and\nmaterial living conditions through shared, albeit contested and\ncontestable, narrative accounts. (Benhabib 2002: 5)\n\n\nThat there is contestation among members, and that its main elements\nare under constant negotiation, does not render a culture any less\nmeaningful for its members. What may seem confusing is the idea that a\ncontestable and constantly shifting culture warrants protection;\nperhaps protection means artificially halting the natural changes that\na culture would undergo, by protecting elements of it at a moment in\ntime. But defenders of this view demand protection in the form of\nensuring that the forums in which culture is negotiated, shared and\ntransmitted, are sustained in robust and inclusive ways, and without\nunwanted interference by forces external to the culture. As with the\nculture-as-formation account, the emphasis is on the capacity of group\nmembers to shape the norms and practices that are central, rather than\nwith the norms and practices themselves.\n\nHow does this view respond to the worry about asymmetrical power\ndistribution within a cultural group? Focusing on the ways in which a\nculture\u2019s central characteristics are determined via negotiation\namong members is an attempt to be attentive to the power structures\nthat shape whose voice is heard during these negotiations, in\nminority and majority cultures (Dhamoon 2006). In many, and indeed\nperhaps in most, cultures, historically the dominant voices have been\nmale, and one impact of that has generally been a gendered view of the\nhow best to organize cultural life,\u00a0that has reduced the rights\nof women (and other minorities) in myriad ways, often to their\ndisadvantage as well as against their will. For some, the oppression\nof less powerful members by those who hold the levers of power\ngenerates at least partial skepticism about the value of protecting or\naccommodating culture in liberal, democratic states, especially in\ncases where it may seem that \u201cmulticulturalism is bad for\nwomen\u201d (Okin 1999). On this view, cultural practices that\nundermine the rights of women (and other minorities) should not be\ntolerated in liberal democratic states.\n\nThe recognition that many cultural practices are disadvantageous to\nwomen (and other minorities) does not propel all political theorists\nto adopt a skeptical attitude towards them in all cases. For some, it\nis an opportunity to see that cultures can be valued even by those who\nare putatively oppressed, even as they work from the inside to\ninfluence the direction of their culture, towards less oppressive\nnorms and practices. For example, although often sidelined from their\ncentres of power, many women value their cultures in ways that press\nthem not to exit, but rather to engage in processes of reforming\ninegalitarian practices and norms, from within (Deveaux 2007). This\nway of thinking about culture and its contents celebrates, and\nencourages, moves to \u201cdemocratize\u201d the mechanisms by which\na cultural group\u2019s main norms, values and practices are adopted,\nand defends public cultures that are genuinely open to multiple voices\n(Lenard 2012).\n\nThis narrative or dialogic account of culture thus responds well to\nthe essentialist challenge, by denying that the defining features of a\nculture must be static and equally valuable to\u00a0all members of a\ncultural group. But, it must respond to another challenge, namely, the\nindividuation challenge (Moore 2019). If an account of culture is\ngoing to be robust enough to define the entities that should be\nentitled to additional political and legal consideration in various\nways, including with respect to additional rights protections or\nexemptions from certain legal and political requirements, it must also\nbe able to identify with some specificity the boundaries of a\nparticular, discrete, culture and who legitimately counts as a member\nfor the purposes of respecting the political and legal claims made as\na result. But this can be a challenge to accomplish.\n\nTo see why, consider Benhabib\u2019s account of the ways in which\ncultures are observed from the outside, and the way they are\nexperienced from the inside. The observer is largely\nresponsible, she says, for imposing \u201cunity and coherence on\ncultures\u201d, whereas from the inside, its participants\n\n\nexperience their traditions, stories, rituals and symbols, tools, and\nmaterial living conditions through shared, albeit contested and\ncontestable, narrative accounts. (Benhabib 2002: 5)\n\n\nOne effect of understanding the culture in this way is that while many\nof its members will hold deeply to the central values and take deep\nsatisfaction in participating in the central cultural traditions, many\nothers will dip in and out of its central practices, and pick and\nchoose among its central values and norms. So, just who\ncounts as a member is blurry, and this blurriness\u00a0may appear to\nbe a\u00a0problem when membership is said to confer rights and\nprivileges that are not available to non-members. There is an\ninevitable tension between the need to individuate cultures for\npolitical reasons and the boundaries of cultures which are inevitably\npoorly demarcated. Only context will enable us to resolve the\npolitical questions that will thereby emerge.\n",
