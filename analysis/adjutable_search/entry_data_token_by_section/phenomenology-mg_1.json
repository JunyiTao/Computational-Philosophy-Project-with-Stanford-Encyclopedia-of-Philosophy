It begins by summarizing some of\nthe main contributions early phenomenologists delivered on the general\ntheory of intentionality\n (\u00a72.1).\n In a subsequent step, it zooms in on intersubjective forms of\nintentionality by discussing social, empathic, and collective acts\n (\u00a72.2).\n Phenomenological insights into the philosophy of mind shape a\nmulti-faceted and articulated view about mentality and its position in\nthe natural and social world, which anticipates many contemporary\npositions on these and related issues.\n",
