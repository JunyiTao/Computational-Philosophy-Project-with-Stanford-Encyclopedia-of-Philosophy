    "main_text": "Drift as Models, Drift as a Law\n6. Conclusions\n\nPhilosophical discussions of random genetic drift have been lively and\nfruitful. But as they are still relatively recent, there are many\nissues yet to be explored or explored fully. Although much energy has\nbeen diverted toward debating statisticalism, there are many debates\nover drift that biologists are engaged in that philosophers could\nprofitably weigh in on, both historical and contemporary. With respect\nto the last two sections of this article in particular (empirical\nissues concerning drift and models of drift), we may have only begun\nto scratch the surface.\n",
