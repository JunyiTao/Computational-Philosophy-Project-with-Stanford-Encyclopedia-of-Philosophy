    "main_text": "Atomism\n2. Atomism\n\nModern chemistry is thoroughly atomistic. All substances are thought\nto be composed of small particles, or atoms, of the Periodic Table\u2019s\nelements. Yet until the beginning of the 20th century, much\ndebate surrounded the status of atoms and other microscopic\nconstituents of matter. As with many other issues in philosophy of\nchemistry, the discussion of atomism begins with Aristotle, who\nattacked the coherence of the notion and disputed explanations\nsupposedly built on the idea of indivisible constituents of matter\ncapable only of change in respect of position and motion, but not\nintrinsic qualities. We will discuss Aristotle\u2019s critiques of atomism\nand Boyle\u2019s response as well as the development of atomism in the 19th\nand 20th centuries.\n",
