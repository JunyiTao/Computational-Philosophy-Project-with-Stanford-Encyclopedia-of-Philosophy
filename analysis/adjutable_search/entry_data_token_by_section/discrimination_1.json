    "main_text": "The Concept of Discrimination || A First Approximation\n1.1 A First Approximation\n\n\nIn his review of the international treaties that outlaw discrimination,\nWouter Vandenhole finds that \u201c[t]here is no universally accepted\ndefinition of discrimination\u201d (2005: 33). In fact, the core\nhuman rights documents fail to define discrimination at all, simply\nproviding non-exhaustive lists of the grounds on which discrimination\nis to be prohibited. Thus, the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights declares that \u201cthe law shall prohibit any\ndiscrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective\nprotection against discrimination on any ground such as race, color,\nsex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social\norigin, property, birth or other status\u201d (Article 26). And\nthe European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights declares,\n\u201cThe enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this\nConvention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such\nas sex, race, color, language, religion, political or other opinion,\nnational or social origin, association with a national minority,\nproperty, birth or other status\u201d (Article 14). Left\nunaddressed is the question of what discrimination itself is.\n\n\nStandard accounts hold that discrimination consists of actions,\npractices, or policies that are\u2014in some appropriate\nsense\u2014based on the (perceived) social group to which those\ndiscriminated against belong and that the relevant groups must be\nsocially salient in that they structure interaction in important\nsocial contexts (cf. Lippert-Rasmussen 2006: 169, and Holroyd 2018:\n384).  Thus, groups based on race, religion and gender qualify as\npotential grounds of discrimination in any modern society, but groups\nbased on the length of a person\u2019s toenails would typically not\nqualify.  However, Eidelson has challenged the social salience\nrequirement (2015: 28\u201330), and a sound understanding of what makes\ndiscrimination wrongful might depend on how the challenge is resolved.\nEidelson\u2019s view is examined in section 4.1 below. In the\nmeantime, the analysis of discrimination presented here will proceed\non the basis of the social salience requirement.\n\n\nDiscrimination against persons, then, is necessarily oriented toward\nthem based on their membership in a certain type of social group.  But\nit is also necessary that the discriminatory conduct impose some kind\nof disadvantage, harm, or wrong on the persons at whom it is\ndirected. In this connection, consider the landmark opinion of the\nU.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education, holding\nthat de jure racial segregation in public schools is\nunconstitutional. The Court writes, \u201cSegregation with the\nsanction of law \u2026 has a tendency to [retard] the educational\nand mental development of negro children and to deprive them of some\nof the benefits they would receive in a racial[ly] integrated school\nsystem\u201d (1954: 495). Thus, the court rules that segregation\namounts to illegal discrimination against black children because it\nimposes on them educational and psychological disadvantages.\n\n\nAdditionally, as Brown makes clear, the disadvantage imposed\nby discrimination is to be determined relative to some appropriate\ncomparison social group. This essential reference to a comparison\ngroup explains why duties of non-discrimination are \u201cduties to\ntreat people in certain ways defined by reference to the way that\nothers are treated\u201d (Gardner 1998: 355). Typically, the\nrelevant comparison group is part of the same society as the\ndisadvantaged group, or at least it is governed by the same overarching\npolitical structure. In Brown, the relevant comparison\ngroup consisted of white citizens. Accordingly, it would be\nmistaken to think that the black citizens of Kansas who brought the\nlawsuit were not discriminated against because they were treated no\nworse than blacks in South Africa were being treated under\napartheid. Blacks in South Africa were not the proper comparison\nclass.\n\n\nThe appropriate comparison class is determined by normative\nprinciples. American states are obligated to provide their black\ncitizens an education that is no worse than what they provide to their\nwhite citizens; any comparison with the citizens or subjects of other\ncountries is beside the point. It should also be noted that,\nwhether or not American states have an obligation to provide an\neducation to any of their citizens, if such states provide an education\nto their white citizens, then it is discriminatory for the states to\nfail to provide an equally good education to their black\ncitizens. And if states do have an obligation to provide\nan education to all their citizens, then giving an education to whites\nbut not blacks would constitute a double-wrong against blacks: the\nwrong of discrimination, which depends on how blacks are treated in\ncomparison to whites, and the wrong of denying blacks an education,\nwhich does not depend on how whites are treated.\n\n\nDiscrimination is necessarily comparative, and the Brown case\nseems to suggest that what counts in the comparison is not how well or\npoorly a person (or group) is treated on some absolute scale, but\nrather how well she is treated relative to some other person.  But an\nimportant element of the court\u2019s reasoning in Brown\nsuggests that the disadvantage or wrong imposed by a discriminatory\nact can encompass more than the harmful downstream causal consequences\nof the act. Thus, the Court famously writes, \u201cSeparate\neducational facilities are inherently unequal\u201d (1954: 495). The\nCourt can be construed as saying that, apart from the harmful\neducational and psychological consequences for black children, the Jim\nCrow segregation of public schools stamps those children with a badge\nof inferiority and thereby treats them unfavorably in comparison to\nwhite children.\n\n\nIt is important to recognize that discrimination, in the morally and\nsocially relevant sense, is not simply differential treatment.\nDifferential treatment is symmetrical: if blacks are treated\ndifferently from whites, then whites must be treated differently from\nblacks. But it is implausible to hold that Jim Crow and South Africa\u2019s\napartheid system discriminated against whites. The system arguably\nheld back economic progress for everyone in the South, but that point\nis quite different from the implausible claim that everyone was a\nvictim of discrimination.  Accordingly, it is better to think of\ndiscrimination in terms of disadvantageous treatment rather than\nsimply differential treatment. Discrimination imposes a disadvantage\non certain persons relative to others, and those who are treated more\nfavorably are not to be seen as victims of discrimination.\n\n\nAn act can both be discriminatory and, simultaneously, confer an\nabsolute benefit on those discriminated against, because the conferral\nof the benefit might be combined with conferring a greater benefit on\nthe members of the appropriate comparison group. In such a case,\nthe advantage of receiving an absolute benefit is, at the same time, a\nrelative disadvantage or deprivation. For example,\nconsider the admissions policy of Harvard University in the early\ntwentieth century, when the university had a quota on the number of\nJewish students. Harvard was guilty of discriminating against all\nJewish applicants on account of their religion. Yet, the\nuniversity still offered the applicants something of substantial value,\nviz., the opportunity to compete successfully for admission. What\nmade the university\u2019s offer of this opportunity discriminatory\nwas that the quota placed (potential and actual) Jewish applicants at a\ndisadvantage, due to their religion, relative to Christian ones.\n\n\nOne might think that it downplays the harm done by discrimination to\nsay that the disadvantage it imposes only need be a relative\ndisadvantage. However, the Brown case shows how the\nimposition of even a \u201cmerely\u201d relative disadvantage can\nhave extremely bad and unjust consequences for persons, especially\nwhen the relevant comparison class consists of one\u2019s fellow\ncitizens. Disadvantages relative to fellow citizens, when those\ndisadvantages are severe and concern important goods such as education\nand social status, can make persons vulnerable to domination and\noppression at the hands of their fellow citizens (Anderson 1999). The\ndomination and oppression of American blacks by their fellow citizens\nunder Jim Crow was made easier by the relative disadvantage imposed on\nblacks when it came to education. Norwegians might have had an even\nbetter education than southern whites, but Norwegians posed little\nthreat of domination to southern whites or blacks, because they lived\nunder an entirely separate political structure, having minimal\nrelations to American citizens. Matters are different in today\u2019s\nglobalized world, where an individual\u2019s disadvantage in access\nto education relative to persons who live in other countries could\npose a threat of oppression. Accordingly, one must seriously consider\nthe possibility that children from poor countries are being\ndiscriminated against when they are unable to obtain the education\nroutinely available to children in affluent societies. \n\n\nThe relative nature of the disadvantage that discrimination imposes\nexplains the close connection between discrimination and\ninequality. A relative disadvantage necessarily involves an\ninequality with respect to persons in the comparison class.\nAccordingly, antidiscrimination norms prohibit certain sorts of\ninequalities between persons in the relevant comparison classes (Shin\n2009).  For example, the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1866 requires\nthat all citizens \u201cshall have the same right, in every State and\nTerritory in the United States, to make and enforce contracts, to sue,\nbe parties, and give evidence, to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold,\nand convey real and personal property, and to full and equal benefit of\nall laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is\nenjoyed by white citizens\u201d (Civil Rights Act 1866). And the\ninternational convention targeting discrimination against women\ncondemns \u201cany distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the\nbasis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying\nthe recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women \u2026 on a basis of\nequality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms\u201d (CEDAW, Article 1).\n\n\nTo review: as a reasonable first approximation, we can say that\ndiscrimination consists of acts, practices, or policies that impose a\nrelative disadvantage on persons based on their membership in a salient\nsocial group. But notice that this account does not make\ndiscrimination morally wrong as a conceptual matter. The\nimposition of a relative disadvantage might, or might not, be\nwrongful. In the next section, we will see how the idea of moral\nwrongfulness can be introduced to form a moralized concept of\ndiscrimination.\n\n\nIn recent years, some thinkers have rejected the view that\ndiscrimination is an essentially comparative concept that looks to how\ncertain persons are treated relative to others. For example,\nR\u00e9aume argues against the view by invoking the\n\u201cleveling-down objection.\u201d She points out that, if there\nis an inequality in the distribution of some benefit between two\npersons or groups, then we need to ask \u201cwhether leveling up or\nleveling down are, other things held constant, regarded as equally\nattractive solutions\u201d (2013: 8). The comparative view seems to\nentail that the two solutions are equally attractive, but,\nR\u00e9aume points out, plaintiffs in discrimination cases who are\ndemanding equal treatment \u201crarely put their claim this\nway\u201d (8) and would not be satisfied with the leveling-down\nsolution: \u201cthey ask to vote as well, not that voting be\nabolished, or that a pension scheme include them, not that it be\nrepealed.\u201d R\u00e9aume continues, \u201cTo level down would\ndeprive everyone of something all are properly entitled to, and thus\nexacerbate rather than solve the problem\u201d (11).\n\n\nNonetheless, the leveling-down objection is problematic. That\nplaintiffs in discrimination cases do not ask that voting be abolished\nonly shows that they know that they would be better off with everyone\nhaving the right to vote than with no one having it. Moreover,\nalthough leveling down would, in typical cases, deprive everyone of\nsomething to which all are entitled, it does not follow that leveling\ndown would constitute discrimination. The universal denial of the\nfranchise would be a wrong, but not the wrong of\ndiscrimination. Denial of the franchise amounts to discrimination only\nwhen it is selectively directed at some salient group within the adult\npopulation. Accordingly, Lippert-Rasmussen seems to be right when he\nexplains, \u201cUnlike other prima facie morally wrong acts, such as\nlying, hurting, or manipulating, one cannot discriminate against some\nunless there are others who receive (or who would receive) better\ntreatment at one\u2019s hands \u2026. I can rebut an accusation of\nhaving discriminated against someone by saying that I would have\ntreated anyone else at least as badly in that situation\u201d (2014:\n16).\n",
