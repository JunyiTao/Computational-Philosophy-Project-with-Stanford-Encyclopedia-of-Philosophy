Without ears, tongues, and skin\naround armpits, there are no sounds, tastes, or tickles but only\nvarious shapes, motions,\n etc.[1]\n In particular, some bodies are constantly divided into tiny\nparticles; some of them rise, enter the nasal passages and start a\nprocess that ends with odors; others fall onto the surface of the\ntongue, mix with saliva and eventually produce tastes; tiny vibrations\nthat pervade the air make contact with the ear drums which connect\nwith other organs that produce sounds; finally, there is a particular\nsort of igneous particle found in fire which moves through pores of\nthe body and makes us warm. Many observations are brought in support\nof these hypotheses (Galileo 1623 [2003: 188\u20139]). Thought\nexperiments establish the possibility of this account. Two features of\nthe hypothesis are particularly important. First, it sketches a\nprogram of explanation for natural philosophy in which the distinction\nof PQs and SQs has an essential part (Crombie 1972: 80\u20137).\nSecond, it entails that SQs are not in bodies that cause them but\ninternal to sentient bodies\u2014effects of the mechanical affections\nof insensient bodies on the sensory organs of living bodies. Piccolino\nand Wade (2008: 1218\u201319, 1319\u201321) portray Galileo as\nadvocating the sort of explanatory program urged later by Hermann\nHelmholtz and presently pursued in neuro-psychology. (On\nHelmholtz\u2019 version of the P/SQ distinction, see Hatfield\n2011.)\n",
