    "main_text": "Post-Cartesian Development || Pseudo-Science\n3.3 Pseudo-Science\nAs philosophy reduced the pineal gland to just another part of the brain and science studied it as one endocrine gland among many, the pineal gland continued to have an exalted status in the realm of pseudo-science. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Madame Blavatsky, the founder of theosophy, identified the \u201cthird eye\u201d discovered by the comparative anatomists of her time with the \u201ceye of Shiva\u201d of \u201cthe Hindu mystics\u201d and concluded that the pineal body of modern man is an atrophied vestige of this \u201corgan of spiritual vision\u201d (Blavatsky 1888, vol. 2, pp. 289\u2013306). This theory is still fairly well-known today.\n",
