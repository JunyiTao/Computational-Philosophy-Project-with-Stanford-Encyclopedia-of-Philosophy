Children and the Reproduction of Values\n\nThe putative possession by a child of a right to an \u2018open\nfuture\u2019 together with the imperative to promote any\nchild\u2019s best interests raises the question of what, if anything,\nis wrong with the transmission to a child of values. These most\nobviously may be those values by which the child\u2019s parent lives\nand which may also help to define the identity of a community. Article\n2 of the UNCRC accords the child a right to non-discrimination on\nvarious grounds including \u2018national, ethnic or social\norigin\u2019; and Article 30 recognises that a child belonging to an\n\u2018ethnic, religious or linguistic\u2019 minority \u2018shall\nnot be denied the right, in community with other members of his or her\ngroup, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practise his or\nher own religion, or to use his or her own language\u2019.\n\nYet, for many liberals, there is a tension between the recognition of\nsuch rights and the requirement that a child not be inducted into a\ncommunity in such a manner that his or her future adult choices are\nconstrained. The main way in which this is set out is by means of an\nemphasis upon a liberal ideal of an autonomous life, one in which an\nindividual is able both to form his or her own conception of the good\nlife to lead and is not prevented \u2013 by external social\ncircumstances or the actions of others \u2013 from being able to lead\nthe preferred life. Often the target that is juxtaposed to such a\nliberal ideal is the values of religious minorities. The Supreme Court\njudgment that prompted Joel Feinberg\u2019s defence of a\nchild\u2019s right to an \u2018open future\u2019, and which has\nbeen extensively discussed, is Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972). This\nexempted the Amish community from the requirement to keep their\nchildren in school to the age others are so required in the interests\nof maintaining that community\u2019s identity. Arneson and Shapiro in\nresponse contrast \u2018religious traditionalist\u2019 and\n\u2018secular worldly\u2019 ways of life, seeing an education for\nthe latter as the best preparation for an open future (Arneson and\nShapiro 1996).\n\nThe problem with this approach is that the preferential treatment\n\u2013 in the way that children are schooled \u2013 is both\ndiscriminatory and may violate the central precept of liberal\nneutrality, the requirement that the state not, in its law and\npolicies, favour any conception of the good (see the entry on\nPerfectionism in Moral and Political Philosophy). Moreover, some\nliberals will argue that the character traits and dispositions of\nautonomy, for instance steadfastness of character, are best taught by\nbeing raised in adherence to a particular way of life, such as one of\nreligious faith (Callan, 2002; Burtt 1996).\n\nLiberals may escape the charge of violating the principle of\nneutrality by arguing that a liberal society requires that its\ncitizens be motivated by a sense of justice and an ability to\nparticipate effectively within democratic institutions. This\nrequirement is satisfied only if children are brought up in certain\nvalues and are able, when adults, to make maximally autonomous\nchoices. In this manner the promotion of autonomy and an open future\ncan be seen as an indirect consequence of a necessary education in\nthose civic capacities that are the necessary precondition of stable\nand sustainable liberal institutions.\n\nThe tension that is broached by a child\u2019s right to an open\nfuture is given a clear and provocative reading in Matthew\nClayton\u2019s book (Clayton 2006). He argues that parents may not\n\u2018enrol their children into comprehensive doctrines\u2019, in\nother words, bring them up to believe in general truths about the best\nway to lead a life, whatever the provenance of those truths. Thus, his\nview is broader than a critique of a religious education. But at the\nsame time, it would indict the vast majority of conscientious parents\nseeking to bring up their children as they see best.\n\nHis defence of this view relies on a claimed analogy between the\nexercises of political and of parental power. The former is only\nlegitimate on liberal grounds in the absence of any appeal to the\ncorrectness of some comprehensive doctrine. Clayton thinks that the\nsimilarities between the two exercises of power are sufficiently\nstrong and robust for parental conduct to be constrained by the same\nliberal principle of legitimacy.\n\nIn response it may be argued that the two domains of power are not\nanalogous. It may also be suggested that there is a morally relevant\ndifference between parents setting out to enrol their children in a\ncomprehensive doctrine and children coming to share such a doctrine\nbecause of sharing their life with their parents (Archard 2002).\nIndeed, if the institution of the family as an essentially intimate\nand private community of adults and children can be defended and if,\nfurther, adults have a protected right to lead their lives by the\nlight of their preferred conception of the good, then such unintended\nenrolment is inevitable. Others will argue that it is not possible to\nteach children that sense of justice which liberals see as critical to\nthe sustainability of a fair society without embedding it in a\ncomprehensive doctrine (Franklin-Hall 2019).\n\nIt is of course a further question of whether certain communal\nvalues violate liberal values other than autonomy \u2013 such as\nequality. For example, it would be wrong to rear boys and girls in\ngendered stereotypes that perpetuate inequality and\ndiscrimination.\n",
