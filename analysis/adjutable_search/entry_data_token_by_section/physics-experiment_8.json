Thomson and the Electron\n\nExperiment can also provide us with evidence for the existence of the\nentities involved in our theories. J.J. Thomson\u2019s experiments on\ncathode rays provided grounds for belief in the existence of\nelectrons. (For details of this episode see\n Appendix 7).\n3.4.2 The Articulation of Theory: Weak Interactions\n\nExperiment can also help to articulate a theory. Experiments on beta\ndecay during from the 1930s to the 1950s determined the precise\nmathematical form of Fermi\u2019s theory of beta decay. (For details\nof this episode see\n Appendix 8.)\n4. Experiment and Observation\n\nThe distinction between observation and experiment is relatively\nlittle discussed in philosophical literature, despite its continuous\nrelevance to the scientific community and beyond in understanding\nspecific traits and segments of the scientific process and the\nknowledge it produces.\n\nDaston and her coauthors (Daston 2011; Daston and Lunbeck 2011; Daston\nand Galison 2007) have convincingly demonstrated that the distinction\nhas played a role in delineating various features of scientific\npractice. It has helped scientists articulate their reflections on\ntheir own practice.\n\nObservation is philosophically a loaded term, yet the epistemic status\nof scientific observation has evolved gradually with the advance of\nscientific techniques of inquiry and the scientific communities\npursuing them. Daston succinctly summarizes this evolution in the\nfollowing passage:\n\nCharacteristic of the emergent epistemic genre of the observations\nwas, first, an emphasis on singular events, witnessed first hand\n(autopsia) by a named author (in contrast to the accumulation of\nanonymous data over centuries described by Cicero and Pliny as typical\nof observationes); second, a deliberate effort to separate observation\nfrom conjecture (in contrast to the medieval Scholastic connection of\nobservation with the conjectural sciences, such as astrology); and\nthird, the creation of virtual communities of observers dispersed over\ntime and space, who communicated and pooled their observations in\nletters and publications (in contrast to passing them down from father\nto son or teacher to student as rare and precious treasures). (2011,\n81)\n\n\nObservation gradually became juxtaposed to other, more complex modes\nof inquiry such as experiment, \u201cwhose meaning shifted from the\nbroad and heterogeneous sense of experimentum as recipe, trial, or\njust common experience to a concertedly artificial manipulation, often\nusing special instruments and designed to probe hidden causes\u201d\n(Daston 2011, 82).\n\nIn the 17th century, observation and experiment were seen as \u201can\ninseparable pair\u201d (Daston 2011, 82) and by the 19th century they\nwere understood to be essentially opposed, with the observer\nincreasingly seen as passive and thus epistemically inferior to the\nexperimenter. In fact, already Leibniz anticipated this view stating\nthat \u201c[t]here are certain experiments that would be better\ncalled observations, in which one considers rather than produces the\nwork\u201d (Daston 2011, 86). This aspect of the distinction has been\na mainstay of understanding scientific practice ever since.\n\nShapere (1982) pointed out that the usage of the notion of observation\nis embedded in scientific practice, including testing and\njustification of scientific theories. Neutrinos arriving from the Sun\nare said to be observed in the detector but are also said to be an\nobservation of the Sun\u2019s core. Yet, the background knowledge\nprovides the foundation for a meaningful distinction. One the one hand\nthere are weakly interacting neutrinos leaving the Sun\u2019s core\nand entering detector practically interrupted. This may be justifiably\nqualified as \u201cdirect observation\u201d of the Sun\u2019s core.\nOn the other hand, there is a rather indirect observation of the core\nvia detection of light-photons that travel for billions of years from\nthe Sun\u2019s core through the plasma to the electromagnetic\ndetectors.\n\nThere are currently two prominent and opposed views of the\nexperiment-observation distinction. Ian Hacking has characterized it\nas well-defined, while avoiding the claim that observation and\nexperiment are opposites (Hacking 1983, 173). According to him, the\nnotions signify different things in scientific practice. The\nexperiment is a thorough manipulation that creates a new phenomenon,\nand observation of the phenomenon is its outcome. If scientists can\nmanipulate a domain of nature to such an extent that they can create a\nnew phenomenon in a lab, a phenomenon that normally cannot be observed\nin nature, then they have truly observed the phenomenon (Hacking 1989,\n1992).\n\nMeanwhile, other authors concur that \u201cthe familiar distinction\nbetween observation and experiment \u2026 [is] an artefact of the\ndisembodied, reconstructed character of retrospective accounts\u201d\n(Gooding 1992, 68). The distinction \u201ccollapses\u201d when we\nare faced with actual scientific practice as a process, and\n\u201cHacking\u2019s observation versus experiment framework does\nnot survive intact when put to the test in a range of cases of\nscientific experimentation\u201d (Malik 2017, 85). First, the uses of\nthe distinction cannot be compared across scientific fields. And\nsecond, as Gooding (1992) suggests, observation is a process too, not\nsimply a static result of manipulation. Thus, both observation and\nexperiment are seen as concurrent processes blended together in\nscientific practice.\n\nMalik (2017, 86) states that these arguments are the reason why\n\u201cvery few [authors] use Hacking\u2019s nomenclature of\nobservation/experiment\u201d and goes so far to conclude that\n\u201cto (try to) distinguish between observation and experiment is\nfutile.\u201d There is no point delineating the two except perhaps in\ncertain narrow domains; e.g., Hacking\u2019s notion of the experiment\nbased on creating phenomena might be useful within a narrow domain of\nparticle physics. (See also Chang 2011.) He advocates avoiding the\ndistinction altogether and opting for \u201cthe terminology [that]\nunderlines this sense of continuousness\u201d (Malik 2017, 88)\ninstead. If we want to analyze scientific practice, the argument goes,\nwe should leave behind the idea of the distinction as fundamental and\nturn to the characterization and analysis of various \u201cepistemic\nactivities\u201d instead, e.g., along the lines suggested by Chang\n(2011).\n\nA rather obvious danger of this approach is an over-emphasis on the\ncontinuousness of the notions of observation and experiment that\nresults in inadvertent equivocation. And this, in turn, results in\nsidelining the distinction and its subtleties in the analysis of the\nscientific practice, despite their crucial role in articulating and\ndeveloping that practice since the 17th century. It is possible\nthat these two notions form a continuum spreading along the axes of\nmanipulability and accessibility of both target phenomena and\nobservational conditions, and that the key points on such continuum\ndefine various evolving practices. Thus, each scientific practice may\nbe located on the continuum, with the location defining both its\nepistemic properties and the epistemic (as well as ethical)\nobligations that underlie it at a given time. (Perovi\u0107 2021)\n\nOn the one hand, the extent of the manipulation of phenomena and\nresearch conditions ranges from bodily manipulations  (e.g.\nfinding a convenient location to observe a planet with the naked eye)\nto the production of new phenomena in an elaborate apparatus like LHC\nat CERN, where the label \u201cexperiment\u201d aims to delineate a\nsubstantial threshold of manipulation. On the other hand, depending on\nthe background knowledge and aims of the research, observational\naccessibility ranges from mere detection of a potentially interesting\nphenomenon (e.g. a metal detector detects something in the ground),\nall the way to direct observation of the phenomenon\u2019s properties\n(e.g., the microscopic analysis of a metal object).\n5. Some Comparisons With Experiment in Biology\n5.1 Epistemological Strategies and the Peppered Moth Experiment\n\nOne comment that has been made concerning the philosophy of experiment\nis that all of the examples are taken from physics and are therefore\nlimited. In this section arguments will be presented that these\ndiscussions also apply to biology.\n\nAlthough all of the illustrations of the epistemology of experiment\ncome from physics, David Rudge (1998; 2001) has shown that they are\nalso used in biology. His example is Kettlewell\u2019s (1955; 1956;\n1958) evolutionary biology experiments on the Peppered Moth,\nBiston betularia. The typical form of the moth has a\npale speckled appearance and there are two darker forms, f.\ncarbonaria, which is nearly black, and f. insularia,\nwhich is intermediate in color. The typical form of the moth\nwas most prevalent in the British Isles and Europe until the middle of\nthe nineteenth century. At that time things began to change.\nIncreasing industrial pollution had both darkened the surfaces of\ntrees and rocks and had also killed the lichen cover of the forests\ndownwind of pollution sources. Coincident with these changes,\nnaturalists had found that rare, darker forms of several moth species,\nin particular the Peppered Moth, had become common in areas downwind\nof pollution sources.\n\nKettlewell attempted to test a selectionist explanation of this\nphenomenon. E.B. Ford (1937; 1940) had suggested a two-part\nexplanation of this effect: 1) darker moths had a superior physiology\nand 2) the spread of the melanic gene was confined to industrial areas\nbecause the darker color made carbonaria more conspicuous to\navian predators in rural areas and less conspicuous in polluted areas.\nKettlewell believed that Ford had established the superior viability\nof darker moths and he wanted to test the hypothesis that the darker\nform of the moth was less conspicuous to predators in industrial\nareas.\n\nKettlewell\u2019s investigations consisted of three parts. In the\nfirst part he used human observers to investigate whether his proposed\nscoring method would be accurate in assessing the relative\nconspicuousness of different types of moths against different\nbackgrounds. The tests showed that moths on \u201ccorrect\u201d\nbackgrounds, typical on lichen covered backgrounds and dark\nmoths on soot-blackened backgrounds were almost always judged\ninconspicuous, whereas moths on \u201cincorrect\u201d backgrounds\nwere judged conspicuous.\n\nThe second step involved releasing birds into a cage containing all\nthree types of moth and both soot-blackened and lichen covered pieces\nof bark as resting places. After some difficulties (see Rudge 1998 for\ndetails), Kettlewell found that birds prey on moths in an order of\nconspicuousness similar to that gauged by human observers.\n\nThe third step was to investigate whether birds preferentially prey on\nconspicuous moths in the wild. Kettlewell used a\nmark-release-recapture experiment in both a polluted environment\n(Birmingham) and later in an unpolluted wood. He released 630 marked\nmale moths of all three types in an area near Birmingham, which\ncontained predators and natural boundaries. He then recaptured the\nmoths using two different types of trap, each containing virgin\nfemales of all three types to guard against the possibility of\npheromone differences.\n\nKettlewell found that carbonaria was twice as likely to\nsurvive in soot-darkened environments (27.5 percent) as was\ntypical (12.7 percent). He worried, however, that his results\nmight be an artifact of his experimental procedures. Perhaps the traps\nused were more attractive to one type of moth, that one form of moth\nwas more likely to migrate, or that one type of moth just lived\nlonger. He eliminated the first alternative by showing that the\nrecapture rates were the same for both types of trap. The use of\nnatural boundaries and traps placed beyond those boundaries eliminated\nthe second, and previous experiments had shown no differences in\nlongevity. Further experiments in polluted environments confirmed that\ncarbonaria was twice as likely to survive as\ntypical. An experiment in an unpolluted environment showed\nthat typical was three times as likely to survive as\ncarbonaria. Kettlewell concluded that such selection was the\ncause of the prevalence of carbonaria in polluted\nenvironments.\n\nRudge also demonstrates that the strategies used by Kettlewell are\nthose described above in the epistemology of experiment. His examples\nare given in Table 1. (For more details see Rudge 1998).\n\n\n\n\n \nEpistemological strategies\nExamples from Kettlewell \n\n1.\nExperimental checks and calibration in which the apparatus\nreproduces known phenomena.\nUse of the scoring experiment to verify that the proposed\nscoring methods would be feasible and objective. \n\n2.\nReproducing artifacts that are known in advance to be\npresent.\nAnalysis of recapture figures for endemic betularia\npopulations. \n\n3.\nElimination of plausible sources of background and alternative\nexplanations of the result.\nUse of natural barriers to minimize migration. \n\n4.\nUsing the results themselves to argue for their validity.\nFilming the birds preying on the moths. \n\n5.\nUsing an independently well-corroborated theory of the\nphenomenon to explain the results.\nUse of Ford\u2019s theory of the spread of industrial\nmelanism. \n\n6.\nUsing an apparatus based on a well- corroborated theory.\nUse of Fisher, Ford, and Shepard techniques.

Examples of epistemological\nstrategies used by experimentalists in evolutionary biology, from\nH.B.D. Kettlewell\u2019s (1955, 1956, 1958) investigations of\nindustrial melanism. (See Rudge 1998).\n\n5.2 The Meselson-Stahl Experiment: \u201cThe Most Beautiful Experiment in Biology\u201d\n\nThe roles that experiment plays in physics are also those it plays in\nbiology. In the previous section we have seen that Kettlewell\u2019s\nexperiments both test and confirm a theory. I discussed earlier a set\nof crucial experiments that decided between two competing classes of\ntheories, those that conserved parity and those that did not. In this\nsection I will discuss an experiment that decided among three\ncompeting mechanisms for the replication of DNA, the molecule now\nbelieved to be responsible for heredity. This is another crucial\nexperiment. It strongly supported one proposed mechanism and argued\nagainst the other two. (For details of this episode see Holmes\n2001.)\n\nIn 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson proposed a three-dimensional\nstructure for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Watson and Crick 1953a).\nTheir proposed structure consisted of two polynucleotide chains\nhelically wound about a common axis. This was the famous \u201cDouble\nHelix\u201d. The chains were bound together by combinations of four\nnitrogen bases \u2014 adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.\nBecause of structural requirements only the base pairs adenine-thymine\nand cytosine-guanine are allowed. Each chain is thus complementary to\nthe other. If there is an adenine base at a location in one chain\nthere is a thymine base at the same location on the other chain, and\nvice versa. The same applies to cytosine and guanine. The order of the\nbases along a chain is not, however, restricted in any way, and it is\nthe precise sequence of bases that carries the genetic\ninformation.\n\nThe significance of the proposed structure was not lost on Watson and\nCrick when they made their suggestion. They remarked, \u201cIt has\nnot escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated\nimmediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic\nmaterial.\u201d\n\nIf DNA was to play this crucial role in genetics, then there must be a\nmechanism for the replication of the molecule. Within a short period\nof time following the Watson-Crick suggestion, three different\nmechanisms for the replication of the DNA molecule were proposed\n(Delbruck and Stent 1957). These are illustrated in Figure A. The\nfirst, proposed by Gunther Stent and known as conservative\nreplication, suggested that each of the two strands of the parent DNA\nmolecule is replicated in new material. This yields a first generation\nwhich consists of the original parent DNA molecule and one\nnewly-synthesized DNA molecule. The second generation will consist of\nthe parental DNA and three new DNAs.\n\n\n\nFigure A: Possible mechanisms for DNA\nreplication. (Left) Conservative replication. Each of the two strands\nof the parent DNA is replicated to yield the unchanged parent DNA and\none newly synthesized DNA. The second generation consists of one\nparent DNA and three new DNAs. (Center) Semiconservative replication.\nEach first generation DNA molecule contains one strand of the parent\nDNA and one newly synthesized strand. The second generation consists\nof two hybrid DNAs and two new DNAs. (Right) Dispersive replication.\nThe parent chains break at intervals, and the parental segments\ncombine with new segments to form the daughter chains. The darker\nsegments are parental DNA and the lighter segments are newly\nsynthesized DNA. From Lehninger (1975).\n\n\nThe second proposed mechanism, known as semiconservative replication\nis when each strand of the parental DNA acts as a template for a\nsecond newly-synthesized complementary strand, which then combines\nwith the original strand to form a DNA molecule. This was proposed by\nWatson and Crick (1953b). The first generation consists of two hybrid\nmolecules, each of which contains one strand of parental DNA and one\nnewly synthesized strand. The second generation consists of two hybrid\nmolecules and two totally new DNAs. The third mechanism, proposed by\nMax Delbruck, was dispersive replication, in which the parental DNA\nchains break at intervals and the parental segments combine with new\nsegments to form the daughter strands.\n\nIn this section the experiment performed by Matthew Meselson and\nFranklin Stahl, which has been called \u201cthe most beautiful\nexperiment in biology\u201d, and which was designed to answer the\nquestion of the correct DNA replication mechanism will be discussed\n(Meselson and Stahl 1958). Meselson and Stahl described their proposed\nmethod. \u201cWe anticipated that a label which imparts to the DNA\nmolecule an increased density might permit an analysis of this\ndistribution by sedimentation techniques. To this end a method was\ndeveloped for the detection of small density differences among\nmacromolecules. By use of this method, we have observed the\ndistribution of the heavy nitrogen isotope \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) among\nmolecules of DNA following the transfer of a uniformly\n\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\)-labeled, exponentially growing bacterial population to\na growth medium containing the ordinary nitrogen isotope\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\)\u201d (Meselson and Stahl 1958, pp.\n671\u2013672).\n\n\n\nFigure B: Schematic representation of\nthe Meselson-Stahl experiment. From Watson (1965).\n\n\nThe experiment is described schematically in Figure B. Meselson and\nStahl placed a sample of DNA in a solution of cesium chloride. As the\nsample is rotated at high speed the denser material travels further\naway from the axis of rotation than does the less dense material. This\nresults in a solution of cesium chloride that has increasing density\nas one goes further away from the axis of rotation. The DNA reaches\nequilibrium at the position where its density equals that of the\nsolution. Meselson and Stahl grew E. coli bacteria in a\nmedium that contained ammonium chloride \\((\\ce{NH4Cl})\\) as the sole\nsource of nitrogen. They did this for media that contained either\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\), ordinary nitrogen, or \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\), a heavier\nisotope. By destroying the cell membranes they could obtain samples of\nDNA which contained either \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) or \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\). They\nfirst showed that they could indeed separate the two different mass\nmolecules of DNA by centrifugation (Figure C). The separation of the\ntwo types of DNA is clear in both the photograph obtained by absorbing\nultraviolet light and in the graph showing the intensity of the\nsignal, obtained with a densitometer. In addition, the separation\nbetween the two peaks suggested that they would be able to distinguish\nan intermediate band composed of hybrid DNA from the heavy and light\nbands. These early results argued both that the experimental apparatus\nwas working properly and that all of the results obtained were\ncorrect. It is difficult to imagine either an apparatus malfunction or\na source of experimental background that could reproduce those\nresults. This is similar, although certainly not identical, to\nGalileo\u2019s observation of the moons of Jupiter or to\nMillikan\u2019s measurement of the charge of the electron. In both of\nthose episodes it was the results themselves that argued for their\ncorrectness.\n\n\n\nFigure C: The separation of\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) DNA from \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA by centrifugation. The\nband on the left is \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) DNA and that on the right is from\n\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA. From Meselson and Stahl (1958).\n\n\nMeselson and Stahl then produced a sample of E coli bacteria\ncontaining only \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) by growing it in a medium containing\nonly ammonium chloride with \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) \\((\\ce{^{15}NH4Cl})\\) for\nfourteen generations. They then abruptly changed the medium to\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) by adding a tenfold excess of \\(\\ce{^{14}NH_4Cl}\\).\nSamples were taken just before the addition of \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) and at\nintervals afterward for several generations. The cell membranes were\nbroken to release the DNA into the solution and the samples were\ncentrifuged and ultraviolet absorption photographs taken. In addition,\nthe photographs were scanned with a recording densitometer. The\nresults are shown in Figure D, showing both the photographs and the\ndensitometer traces. The figure shows that one starts only with heavy\n(fully-labeled) DNA. As time proceeds one sees more and more\nhalf-labeled DNA, until at one generation time only half-labeled DNA\nis present. \u201cSubsequently only half labeled DNA and completely\nunlabeled DNA are found. When two generation times have elapsed after\nthe addition of \\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) half-labeled and unlabeled DNA are\npresent in equal amounts\u201d (p. 676). (This is exactly what the\nsemiconservative replication mechanism predicts). By four generations\nthe sample consists almost entirely of unlabeled DNA. A test of the\nconclusion that the DNA in the intermediate density band was half\nlabeled was provided by examination of a sample containing equal\namounts of generations 0 and 1.9. If the semiconservative mechanism is\ncorrect then Generation 1.9 should have approximately equal amounts of\nunlabeled and half-labeled DNA, whereas Generation 0 contains only\nfully-labeled DNA. As one can see, there are three clear density bands\nand Meselson and Stahl found that the intermediate band was centered\nat \\((50 \\pm 2)\\) percent of the difference between the\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) and \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) bands, shown in the bottom\nphotograph (Generations 0 and 4.1). This is precisely what one would\nexpect if that DNA were half labeled.\n\n\n\nFigure D: (Left) Ultraviolet absorption\nphotographs showing DNA bands from centrifugation of DNA from E.\nColi sampled at various times after the addition of an excess of\n\\(\\ce{^{14}N}\\) substrates to a growing \\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) culture.\n(Right) Densitometer traces of the photographs. The initial sample is\nall heavy (\\(\\ce{^{15}N}\\) DNA). As time proceeds a second\nintermediate band begins to appear until at one generation all of the\nsample is of intermediate mass (Hybrid DNA). At longer times a band of\nlight DNA appears, until at 4.1 generations the sample is almost all\nlighter DNA. This is exactly what is predicted by the Watson-Crick\nsemiconservative mechanism. From Meselson and Stahl (1958)\n\n\nMeselson and Stahl stated their results as follows, \u201cThe\nnitrogen of DNA is divided equally between two subunits which remain\nintact through many generations\u2026. Following replication, each\ndaughter molecule has received one parental subunit\u201d (p.\n676).\n\nMeselson and Stahl also noted the implications of their work for\ndeciding among the proposed mechanisms for DNA replication. In a\nsection labeled \u201cThe Watson-Crick Model\u201d they noted that,\n\u201cThis [the structure of the DNA molecule] suggested to Watson\nand Crick a definite and structurally plausible hypothesis for the\nduplication of the DNA molecule. According to this idea, the two\nchains separate, exposing the hydrogen-bonding sites of the bases.\nThen, in accord with base-pairing restrictions, each chain serves as a\ntemplate for the synthesis of its complement. Accordingly, each\ndaughter molecule contains one of the parental chains paired with a\nnewly synthesized chain\u2026. The results of the present experiment\nare in exact accord with the expectations of the Watson-Crick model\nfor DNA replication\u201d (pp. 677\u2013678).\n\nIt also showed that the dispersive replication mechanism proposed by\nDelbruck, which had smaller subunits, was incorrect. \u201cSince the\napparent molecular weight of the subunits so obtained is found to be\nclose to half that of the intact molecule, it may be further concluded\nthat the subunits of the DNA molecule which are conserved at\nduplication are single, continuous structures. The scheme for DNA\nduplication proposed by Delbruck is thereby ruled out\u201d (p. 681).\nLater work by John Cairns and others showed that the subunits of DNA\nwere the entire single polynucleotide chains of the Watson-Crick model\nof DNA structure.\n\nThe Meselson-Stahl experiment is a crucial experiment in biology. It\ndecided between three proposed mechanisms for the replication of DNA.\nIt supported the Watson-Crick semiconservative mechanism and\neliminated the conservative and dispersive mechanisms. It played a\nsimilar role in biology to that of the experiments that demonstrated\nthe nonconservation of parity did in physics. Thus, we have seen\nevidence that experiment plays similar roles in both biology and\nphysics and also that the same epistemological strategies are used in\nboth disciplines.\n6. Computer Simulations and Experimentation\n\nOne interesting recent development in science, and thus in the\nphilosophy of science, has been the increasing use of, and importance\nof, computer simulations. In some fields, such as high-energy physics,\nsimulations are an essential part of all experiments. It is fair to\nsay that without computer simulations these experiments would be\nimpossible. There has been a considerable literature in the philosophy\nof science discussing whether computer simulations are experiments,\ntheory, or some new kind of hybrid method of doing science. But, as\nEric Winsberg remarked, \u201cWe have in other words, rejected the\noverly conservative intuition that computer simulation is nothing but\nboring and straightforward theory application. But we have avoided\nembracing the opposite, overly grandiose intuition that simulation is\na radically new kind of knowledge production, \u201don a par\u201c\nwith experimentation. In fact, we have seen that soberly locating\nsimulation \u201don the methodological map\u201c is not a simple\nmatter (Winsberg 2010, p. 136).\u201d\n\nGiven the importance of computer simulations in science it is\nessential that we have good reasons to believe their results. Eric\nWinsberg (2010), Wendy Parker (2008) and others have shown that\nscientists use strategies quite similar to those discussed in Section\n1.1.1, to argue for the correctness of computer simulations.\n7. Conclusion\n\nIn this entry varying views on the nature of experimental results have\nbeen presented. Some argue that the acceptance of experimental results\nis based on epistemological arguments, whereas others base acceptance\non future utility, social interests, or agreement with existing\ncommunity commitments. Everyone agrees , however, that for whatever\nreasons, a consensus is reached on experimental results. These results\nthen play many important roles in physics and we have examined several\nof these roles, although certainly not all of them. We have seen\nexperiment deciding between two competing theories, calling for a new\ntheory, confirming a theory, refuting a theory, providing evidence\nthat determined the mathematical form of a theory, and providing\nevidence for the existence of an elementary particle involved in an\naccepted theory. We have also seen that experiment has a life of its\nown, independent of theory. If, as I believe, epistemological\nprocedures provide grounds for reasonable belief in experimental\nresults, then experiment can legitimately play the roles I have\ndiscussed and can provide the basis for scientific knowledge.",
