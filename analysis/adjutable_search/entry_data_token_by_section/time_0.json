    "main_text": "Fatalism\n1. Fatalism\n\nMany logical questions about time historically arose from questions\nabout freedom and determinism\u2014in particular worries about\nfatalism. Fatalism can be understood as the doctrine that whatever\nwill happen in the future is already unavoidable (where to\nsay that an event is unavoidable is to say that no agent is able to\nprevent it from occurring). Here is a typical argument for\nfatalism:\n\n(1)\nThere are now propositions about everything that might happen in\nthe future.\n(2)\nEvery proposition is either true or else false.\n(3)\nIf (1) and (2), then there is now a set of true propositions that,\ntaken together, correctly predict everything that will happen in the\nfuture.\n(4)\nIf there is now a set of true propositions that, taken together,\ncorrectly predict everything that will happen in the future, then\nwhatever will happen in the future is already unavoidable.\n\u2234 (5)\nWhatever will happen in the future is already unavoidable.\n\n\nThe conclusion appears shocking. Future moral catastrophes are\nunavoidable. Every weighty decision that now feels up to you is\nalready determined.\n\nThe argument for fatalism makes some significant metaphysical\nassumptions that raise more general questions about logic, time, and\nagency.\n\nFor example, Premise (1) assumes that propositions describing the\nfuture do not come into or go out of existence. It assumes that there\nare propositions now that can accurately represent every future way\nthings might go. This is a non-trivial logical assumption. You might,\nfor instance, think that different times becoming present and actual\n(like perhaps possible worlds) have different associated sets of\npropositions that become present and actual.\n\nPremise (2) appears to be a fundamental principle of semantics,\nsometimes referred to as the Principle of Bivalence.\n\nThe rationale for premise (4) is that it appears no one is able to\nmake a true prediction turn out false. (4) assumes that one and the\nsame proposition does not change its truth value over time. The\nshockingness of the conclusion also depends on identifying meaningful\nagency with the capacity to make propositions come out true or\nfalse.\n\nA proper discussion of fatalism would include a lengthy consideration\nof premises (1) and (4), which make important assumptions about the\nnature of propositional content and the nature of agency. That would\ntake us beyond the scope of this article. For our purposes, it is\nimportant to note that many writers have been motivated by this kind\nof fatalist argument to deny (2), the Principle of Bivalence.\nAccording to this line, there are many propositions\u2014namely,\npropositions about events that are both in the future and\ncontingent\u2014that are neither true nor false right now. Consider\nthe proposition that you will have lunch tomorrow. Perhaps that\nproposition either has no truth value right now, or else has a third\ntruth value: indeterminate. When the relevant time comes, and you\neither have lunch or don\u2019t, then the proposition will come to be\neither true or false, and from then on that proposition will forever\nretain that determinate truth value.\n\nThis strategy for rejecting fatalism is sometimes referred to as the\n\u201cOpen Future\u201d response. The Open Future response\npresupposes that a proposition can have a truth value, but only\ntemporarily\u2014truth values for complete propositions can change as\ntime passes and the world itself changes. This raises further\nquestions about the correct way to link up propositions, temporal\npassage and truth values. For example, which of the following formulas\nexpresses a genuine proposition about the present?\n\n\nTensed Proposition: \u201cSullivan is eating a burrito\u201d.\n\nTenseless Proposition: \u201cSullivan eats a burrito at <insert\npresent time stamp>\u201d.\n\n\nThe tensed proposition will no longer be true when Sullivan finishes\nher lunch. So it has, at best, a temporary truth value. The tenseless\nproposition expresses something like \u201cSullivan eats a burrito at\n3pm on July 20th 2019\u201d. That proposition is always true.\n\nSome philosophers argue that only the latter, eternally true kind of\nproposition could make sense of how we use propositions to reason over\ntime. We need propositions to have stable truth values if we are to\nuse them as the contents of thoughts and communication. Other\nphilosophers\u2014particularly those who believe that reality itself\nchanges over time\u2014think that tensed propositions are needed to\naccurately reason about the world. We\u2019ll return to these issues\nin\n Section 4\n and\n Section 5.\n\nSuggestions for Further Reading: Aristotle, De\nInterpretatione, Ch. 9; Barnes and Cameron 2009; Boethius,\nThe Consolation of Philosophy, Book V; Crisp 2007; Evans\n1985; Lewis 1986; Markosian 1995; McCall 1994; Miller 2005; Richard\n1981; Sullivan 2014; Taylor 1992; Torre 2011; Van Inwagen 1983.\n",
