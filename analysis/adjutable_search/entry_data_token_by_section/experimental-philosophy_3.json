    "main_text": "Research in Experimental Philosophy || Free Will and Moral Responsibility\n2.2 Free Will and Moral Responsibility\n\nResearch in experimental philosophy has explored many aspects of lay\nbeliefs regarding free will. Experimental philosophers have designed\nimproved scales for measuring belief in free will (Nadelhoffer et al.\n2014; Deery et al. 2015), they have investigated the role of the\ndesire to punish in attributing free will (Clark et al. 2014), and\nthey have examined the impact of the belief in free will on moral\nbehavior (Baumeister et al. 2009). But the most intensively studied\nissue concerns intuitions about whether free will is compatible with\ndeterminism.\n\nExperimental philosophers have argued that the philosophical defense\nof incompatibilism depends on intuitions (e.g., Nahmias et al., 2006).\nThe question about whether incompatibilism is true depends on a wide\nvariety of factors, but experimental philosophers have argued that one\nfactor that plausibly matters is the alleged intuitiveness of the\nthought that determinism is incompatible with free will (Murray &\nNahmias 2014, but see Sommers 2010). This then generates a question\nthat invites an empirical inquiry: is incompatibilism\nintuitive? (Nahmias et al. 2006).\n\nOne of the first experimental studies on free will found that people\nseemed to have compatibilist intuitions. Participants were presented\nwith a scenario describing a deterministic universe, and then asked\nwhether a person in the scenario was free and morally responsible\n(Nahmias et al. 2006). In one case, participants were asked to imagine\na future scenario in which there is a supercomputer that is capable of\npredicting all future human behavior when provided with a complete\ndescription of the universe along with the laws of nature. In this\nscenario, a man robs a bank, and participants are asked whether the\nman is morally responsible for his action. Somewhat surprisingly, most\nparticipants gave compatibilist answers, saying that the person was\nmorally blameworthy. This basic finding held across a number of\nscenarios.\n\nIn these early studies on intuitions about free will and moral\nresponsibility, the description of determinism focused on the fact\nthat in a deterministic universe, every event is in principle\npredictable from the past and the laws. In addition, the scenarios\ninvolved particular agents in our world doing bad things. Later\nstudies emphasized the causal nature of\ndeterminism\u2014that what happens at a given point is completely\ncaused by what happened previously\u2014and stressed that what\nhappens in a deterministic universe is inevitable given the\npast. Even with this description of determinism, participants still\ntend to say that a specific concrete individual in such a universe who\ncommits a heinous crime is free and responsible (Nichols & Knobe\n2007; Roskies & Nichols 2008). However, when asked a more abstract\nquestion about whether it is possible in general for people in such a\ndeterministic universe to be free and responsible, participants tend\nto say that morally responsibility is not possible in a deterministic\nuniverse. This incompatibilist response was also found in a cross\ncultural sample with participants from India, Hong Kong, Colombia, and\nthe United States (Sarkissian et al. 2010). In addition to the\nabstract nature of the question, another important element seems to be\nwhether one is considering an alternate deterministic universe or\ncontemplating the possibility that our own universe is deterministic.\nWhen led to consider our own universe as deterministic, participants\nwere more likely to say that people would still be morally responsible\n(Roskies & Nichols 2008).\n\nThus, it seems like people give compatibilist responses under some\nconditions and incompatibilist responses under others. One reaction to\nthis apparent inconsistency is to treat one set of responses as\ndefective. Some experimental philosophers maintain that it\u2019s the\nincompatibilist responses that don\u2019t reflect people\u2019s true\njudgments. The best developed version of this view maintains people\naren\u2019t affirming incompatibilist responses at all (Nahmias &\nMurray 2011; Murray & Nahmias 2014). Instead, when people deny\nfree will and responsibility it\u2019s because they misunderstand the\ndescription of determinism. In particular, people mistakenly interpret\nthe description of determinism to mean that our mental states lack\ncausal efficacy, that the production of our behavior\n\u201cbypasses\u201d our mental states. That is, on this view,\npeople wrongly think that determinism means that a person will behave\nas she does regardless of what she thinks, wants, or intends (Murray\n& Nahmias 2014).\n\nOf course, if people\u2019s mental states have no impact on their\nbehavior, that is an excellent reason to think that people\naren\u2019t morally responsible for their behaviors. So, if people\ninterpret determinism to mean bypassing, it is perfectly\nrational for them to infer the lack of free will and responsibility\nfrom bypassing. However, it seems to be a flat-out confusion to\ninterpret determinism as bypassing. Even if determinism is true, our\nbehavior might be caused (not bypassed) by our mental states. Thus, if\npeople give incompatibilist responses because they confuse determinism\nwith bypassing, then people\u2019s responses don\u2019t reflect a\nreal commitment to incompatibilism.\n\nSurprisingly, people do make bypassing judgments when given a\ndescription of causal determinism. For instance, when presented with a\ndescription of a determinist universe, many participants agreed that\nin that universe, \u201cwhat a person wants has no effect on what\nthey end up doing\u201d (Murray & Nahmias 2014). This suggests\nthat people go through the following confused process: determinism\nmeans bypassing, and bypassing means no free will. If that\u2019s\nright, then the incompatibilist response really is a confusion.\nHowever, another explanation is that people think that determinism\nmeans no free will, and it\u2019s the denial of free will that leads\nto the bypassing judgments. The idea would be roughly that if we\ndon\u2019t have free will, then in some way our mental states\ndon\u2019t lead to our behavior in the way we had thought. Some\nexperimental philosophers have used statistical causal modeling to try\nto tease these two possibilities apart, arguing that it\u2019s the\nlatter explanation that is the right one (Bj\u00f6rnsson 2014; Rose\n& Nichols 2013). That is, people take determinism to entail that\nthere is no free will, and it is this judgment that there is no free\nwill that leads to the bypassing judgment.\n\nThus, there is some reason to think that incompatibilist responses do\nreflect many people\u2019s intuitions. What about the compatibilist\nresponses? Some experimental philosophers maintain that it is these\njudgments that are distorted. On one view, the distortion is caused by\nemotional reactions (e.g., Nichols & Knobe 2007). However, a\nmeta-analysis indicates that there is very little evidence that\nemotions play a critical role in generating compatibilist judgments\n(Feltz & Cova 2014). A different argument for demoting\ncompatibilist judgments holds that many people who affirm free\nwill in deterministic scenarios lack any sensitivity to compatibilist\nconsiderations, but instead will affirm free will even under\nfatalistic conditions in which it is explicitly stipulated that\nJohn\u2019s behavior is inevitable \u201cregardless of the past\nevents in John\u2019s life and the laws of nature\u201d. (This view\nis dubbed \u201cfree will no matter what\u201d; Feltz & Millan\n2015.) One line of argument based on these results is that if\npeople\u2019s attributions of free will are so insensitive, it can\nhardly be said that people appreciate the consistency of free will and\ndeterminism. However, subsequent studies found that in these\nfatalistic scenarios, subjects who affirmed free will still tended to\nthink that the source of the action was in the agent, in harmony with\n\u201csource compatibilism\u201d (Andow & Cova 2016).\n\nThus, the state of the evidence currently suggests that people do have\nboth incompatibilist and compatibilist intuitions. Future empirical\nwork might uncover more clearly what factors and processes draws\npeople in one direction or the other. There are also open questions\nabout whether the role of different psychological mechanisms in\nintuitions about free will has implications for philosophical\nquestions for whether we are truly free and responsible.\n",
