    "main_text": "A Basic Characterization of Rigid Designation, its Interest, and the Breadth of its Application || Rigidity for Temporal and other Non-Alethic Modal Talk\n1.4 Rigidity for Temporal and other Non-Alethic Modal Talk\n\nJust as rigidity might have bearing on different grammatical\ncategories, not merely the paradigms to which Kripke applies it,\nrigidity might also have bearing on different modalities. For example,\njust as \u2018the brightest non-lunar object in the evening\nsky\u2019 seems to designate Venus with respect to the actual\nworld but not with respect to other possible worlds in which\nVenus is obscured by some other body like Mars, just so the expression\nseems to designate Venus with respect to the present time but\nnot with respect to other times at which Venus is obscured by some\nother body. By contrast, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 seem to designate Venus with respect to all\ntimes. (For cautions about the analogy, see G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2006, p. 249.) Therefore, again, \u2018Hesperus = Phosphorus\u2019\nseems to be true regardless of the time of utterance; \u2018Hesperus\n= the brightest nonlunar body in the evening sky\u2019, on the other\nhand, is false when uttered as a passing comet outshines Venus. \n\nWhether we are talking about alethic rigidity (designation of\nthe same individual with respect to other possible worlds) or\ntemporal rigidity (designation of the same individual with\nrespect to other times), a commitment to rigidity will be\nattended by similar sorts of metaphysical and epistemic\ncommitments. Here it will do to indicate briefly some\nontological commitments. Just as recognition of alethically rigid designation carries\nwith it a commitment to some sort of transworld identity\n(discussed later), so the recognition of temporally rigid designation\ncarries with it a commitment to some sort of \u201ctranstime\u201d\nor transtemporal identity. Similar alternatives to rigidity are\navailable to theorists who oppose rigidity. Hence,\nif we adopt the ontological position that individuals are\ninstantaneous so that we find it natural to think in terms of the\n\u201cstages\u201d of you since, although the stages are not\nidentical, they\u2019re similar and ordered in relation to one another\nspatiotemporally or causally, then we might naturally take names like\nyours to range over different instantaneously-lasting individuals, and\nso conclude with Varzi (2003, p. 387), that \u201cthe rigidity claim\ncan\u2019t be right and a counterpart-theoretic semantics seems\nrequired.\u201d\n\nFamiliar, broadly applicable reservations about the reduction of modal\ntalk to counterparts talk arise in their turn: namely reservations\naccording to which ordinary speakers\u2019 accurate talk of a future and a\npast for you uses \u2018you\u2019 and your name\n rigidly since ordinary speakers presuppose or assert that something in the\npast and something in the future is identical to you.[3] The\ncounterpart substitute, it will be said, is either a misdiagnosis or a\ntacit concession to the falsity of ordinary claims and a masking over\nof that falsity by means of a so-called reductive analysis. Quinn, for\nexample, anticipates the dilemma, maintaining that identity through\ntime is what is needed to honor claims to an individual\u2019s lasting\nthrough a day, and maintaining further that if we conclude that we\ndon\u2019t really last over time, and decide anyway that \u201cit\nwould be convenient to speak\u201d in some counterpart-reductive\nfashion in order to be able still to assent when ordinary\nspeakers innocently say \u2018You were around yesterday and will\nprobably be around tomorrow\u2019, then we end up masking our\ndisagreement with what ordinary speakers literally claim (1978, p.\n348). Metaphysical positions of great consequence are thereby\nconcealed: \u2018you\u2019ll be around tomorrow\u2019 is now, according\nto the newly proposed reductive reading, to be accepted on the liberal\nterms that tomorrow there is a line of \u201cmomentary creatures\nendowed with similar properties,\u201d none of whom is really you.\nBut were a reductionist to affirm correctly the usual sentence, now\neviscerated of the usual content, the affirmation should bring you\n\u201cno comfort at all\u201d (1978, p. 350; see also p. 347). The\nhope is that you yourself are around tomorrow; if others are around\ntoo, that might be good, but it is not enough to satisfy your hope.\n(So we would put it if we believed in the reality of different times.\nMore neutrally, we might put the point as follows. When we conceive of\ntomorrow, you\u2019re part of what we\u2019re conceiving as present, hopefully;\nif others are around too, that is irrelevant to this hope.) Since the\nsentence \u2018you\u2019ll be around tomorrow\u2019 on its original\ninterpretation expresses comfortingly that your hope is to be\nrealized, and since the reductive assent does not, the reductive\nassent hardly ends up conveying the appropriate opinion about what\nordinary speakers are talking about. \n\nKripke presents rigidity first as an alethic notion but there\nis also a temporal interpretation, as we\u2019ve seen. There are\nother interpretations too, which is not surprising if rigidity is\nfundamental to all our modal talk: and it seems reasonable to say,\nwith F\u00f8llesdal, that it is. \u201cAll our talk about change, about\ncausation, ethics and knowledge and belief, as well as about the other\nmodalities, presupposes that we can keep our singular terms referring\nto the same objects. To the extent that we fail, these notions become\nincoherent\u201d (F\u00f8llesdal 1986, p. 111). \n\nFurthermore, a term might rigidly designate under\none interpretation of rigidity but non-rigidly designate under a\ndifferent interpretation of rigidity: thus, \u2018Hesperus =\nPhosphorus\u2019 is apparently not epistemically necessary,\neven though it seems alethically and temporally\nnecessary.  Accordingly, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 are plausibly thought not to be epistemically\nrigid, in which case, as Fitting and Mendelsohn (1998, p. 219)\nobserve, \u201cit is hard to see whether there are any rigid\ndesignators under the epistemic reading.\u201d  A counterpart construal (see below) might be offered more plausibly for epistemic possibility than for temporal or alethic possibility, as Kripke himself sometimes suggests (Rabern 2018, pp. 12\u201313): when we say that Hesperus might for all we know have turned out not to be Phosphorus, we seem to have in mind a possible world in which something else\u2014a counterpart\u2014is present in the morning or evening, not Hesperus (Phosphorus).  This entry will\naddress an alethic interpretation of rigidity for the most part.\n",
