    "main_text": "Denying the Import of Higher-Order Evidence\n2. Denying the Import of Higher-Order Evidence\n\nHigher-order evidence raises special problems. One very general\nproblem is that it is hard to see how we could make sense of\nhigher-order evidence within a consistent, total picture of\nrationality. Maria Lasonen-Aarnio (2014) brings out this point\nespecially forcefully and comprehensively, so this next section will\nlargely follow her presentation. (See also Schechter 2013 for\ndiscussion of many similar concerns.) We will then look at a slightly\ndifferent objection to theories that accommodate higher-order\nevidence: the charge that they are self-defeating. The\nsection will conclude with some options for theories according to\nwhich higher-order evidence does not rationally affect\nfirst-order beliefs.\n",
