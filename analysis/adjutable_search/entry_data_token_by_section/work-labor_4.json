If so, then social justice\nwill be centrally concerned with those practices within societies by\nwhich individuals cooperate to produce goods for one another\u2019s\nuse. Work is therefore a central concern of social justice. Questions\nof work and justice arise both with respect to the design of\ninstitutions and the choices of individuals.\n",
