    "main_text": "Justifications and Critiques || Intellectual Property and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n3.4 Intellectual Property and the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\nA major concern and limitation on the traditional justifications for\nintellectual property already discussed is that many scholars reject\nthe starting assumptions needed to generate the desired moral claims.\nFor example, non-utilitarians will dismiss the theoretical foundations\nof utilitarianism. Non-Lockeans will reject Locke\u2019s commitment\nto self-ownership, natural rights, and individual flourishing.\nBuilding off of the positive economic analysis mentioned in the\nutilitarian justification for IP discussed above, Moore (2018) offers\na different sort of argument based on individual prudence and self\ninterest. Note that this argument, while concerned with consequences,\nis not focused on maximizing human well-being or flourishing.\n\nConsider the following case. Imagine that we have two intellectual\nproperty creators, Beren and L\u00fathien, and two possible outcomes\nfor each. In a single-play prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, each player\ncan copy an intellectual creation of the other, or not. Assume as well\nthat the intellectual works created by Beren and L\u00fathien are\nvaluable, interesting, or desired. The best case for either player is\none where their own intellectual creation is not copied and yet they\nget to copy the work of the other player. This is \u2018best\u2019\nfor the player who copies and \u2018worst\u2019 for the player who\ndoesn\u2019t because, (1) the player who copies gets to enjoy or\nconsume more content compared to the other player, (2) the player who\ncopies still has the option or possibility of obtaining benefit by\nselling, trading, or bartering with the other player, while the\nnon-copier does not enjoy these possibilities \u2014 this provides a\nway to recoup research and development costs, and (3) via selling,\ntrading, or bartering the copier may obtain a positional advantage and\nmore capital for future exchanges compared to the non-copier. Simply\nput, the copier obtains more content and retains more opportunities to\nsell, barter, or exchange compared to the non-copier. If Beren and\nL\u00fathien both refrain from copying each other, then each will\navoid the worst outcome in terms of recouping investment costs and\nbeing at a positional disadvantage. Both will also retain the option\nof buying or bartering for the non-copied content the other enjoys.\nThis payoff is \u2018okay,\u2019 better than \u2018worst\u2019 but\nnot as good as \u2018best.\u2019 If both Beren and L\u00fathien\ncopy each other, then both will get extra content to enjoy and will\nnot be put at a positional disadvantage, but each will be denied the\npossibility of recouping research and development costs. The other\nplayer will not buy or barter for content he already possesses. These\npayoffs mirror a prisoner\u2019s dilemma game (Axelrod 198,\n1984, Skyrms 1990, Binmore 2015, Holt, Johnson\nand Schmidtz 2015).\n\nIn modeling content creation, access, and copying as an iterated\nprisoner\u2019s dilemma between numerous individuals, the problem\nbecomes even more salient. It will be individually rational to copy\nthe intellectual efforts and creations of others. This will suppress\ninnovation and lead to a sub-optimal result. Based solely on rational\nself-interest and prudence, Moore argues we should adopt institutions\nthat promote innovation and allow inventors the capacity to recoup\nresearch and development costs. If copying becomes too widespread or\nif enforcement mechanisms fail, then we will likely spiral toward the\ncollectively sub-optimal result of suppressing innovation. We see\nsimilar results of an intellectual property prisoner\u2019s dilemma\nplayed out between nations. Through the use of sanctions against\ncopying the intellectual efforts of others, we give ourselves\ncompelling reasons to pursue a collectively superior outcome.\n",
