    "main_text": "Early Responses to the Paradox\n4. Russell\u2019s Paradox in Contemporary Logic\n\nRussell\u2019s paradox is sometimes seen as a negative development\n\u2013 as bringing down Frege\u2019s Grundgesetze and as\none of the original conceptual sins leading to our expulsion from\nCantor\u2019s paradise.\n W.V. Quine\n describes the paradox as an \u201cantinomy\u201d that \u201cpacks\na surprise that can be accommodated by nothing less than a repudiation\nof our conceptual heritage\u201d (1966, 11). Quine is referring to\nthe Na\u00efve Comprehension principle mentioned earlier. In symbols,\nthe principle states that \n\n(NC)\u00a0\u00a0 \\(\\exists A \\forall x (x \\in A \\equiv \\phi),\\)\n\n\nwhere \\(A\\) is not free in the formula \\(\\phi\\).This says,\n\u201cThere is a set \\(A\\) such that for any object \\(x, x\\) is an\nelement of \\(A\\) if and only if the condition expressed by \\(\\phi\\)\nholds.\u201d Russell\u2019s paradox arises by taking \\(\\phi\\) to be\nthe formula: \\(x \\not\\in x\\). \n\nDespite Quine\u2019s comment, it is possible to see Russell\u2019s\nparadox in a more positive light. For one thing, although the matter\nremains controversial, later research has revealed that the paradox\ndoes not necessarily short circuit Frege\u2019s derivation of\narithmetic from logic alone. Frege\u2019s version of NC (his Axiom V)\ncan simply be abandoned. (For details, see the entry on\n Frege\u2019s Theorem.)\n For another, Church gives an elegant formulation of the simple theory\nof types that has proven fruitful even in areas removed from the\nfoundations of mathematics. (For details, see the entry on\n Type Theory.)\n Finally, the development of axiomatic (as opposed to na\u00efve) set\ntheories which exhibit various ingenious and mathematically and\nphilosophically significant ways of dealing with Russell\u2019s\nparadox paved the way for stunning results in the metamathematics of\nset theory. These results have included\n G\u00f6del\u2019s\n and Cohen\u2019s theorems on the independence of the\n axiom of choice\n and Cantor\u2019s continuum hypothesis. So let us see, roughly, how\nsome of these methods \u2013 specifically, the so-called\n\u201cuntyped\u201d methods \u2013 deal with Russell\u2019s\nparadox.\n\nZermelo replaces NC with the following axiom schema of Separation (or\nAussonderungsaxiom): \n\n(ZA)\u00a0\u00a0 \\(\\forall A \\exists B \\forall x (x \\in B \\equiv(x \\in A \\wedge \\phi)).\\)\n\n\nAgain, to avoid circularity, \\(B\\) cannot be free in \\(\\phi\\). This\ndemands that in order to gain entry into \\(B, x\\) must be a member of\nan existing set \\(A\\). As one might imagine, this requires a host of\nadditional set-existence axioms, none of which would be required if NC\nhad held up. \n\nHow does ZA avoid Russell\u2019s paradox? One might think at first\nthat it doesn\u2019t. After all, if we let \\(A\\) be \\(V\\) \u2013 the\nwhole universe of sets \u2013 and \\(\\phi\\) be \\(x \\not\\in x\\), a\ncontradiction again appears to arise. But in this case, all the\ncontradiction shows is that \\(V\\) is not a set. All the contradiction\nshows is that \u201c\\(V\\)\u201d is an empty name (i.e., that it has no\nreference, that \\(V\\) does not exist), since the ontology of\nZermelo\u2019s system consists solely of sets. \n\nThis same point can be made in yet another way, involving a\nrelativized form of Russell\u2019s argument. Let \\(B\\) be any set. By\nZA, the set \\(R_B = \\{x \\in B: x \\not\\in x\\}\\) exists, but it cannot\nbe an element of \\(B\\). For if it is an element of \\(B\\), then we can\nask whether or not it is an element of \\(R_B\\); and it is if and only\nif it is not. Thus something, namely \\(R_B\\), is \u201cmissing\u201d\nfrom each set \\(B\\). So again, \\(V\\) is not a set, since nothing can be\nmissing from \\(V\\). But notice the following subtlety: unlike the previous\nargument involving the direct application of Aussonderungs to\nV, the present argument hints at the idea that, while \\(V\\) is not a set,\n\u201cV\u201d is not an empty name. The next strategy for dealing\nwith Russell\u2019s paradox capitalizes on this hint. \n\nJohn von Neumann\u2019s (1925) untyped method for dealing with\nparadoxes, and with Russell\u2019s paradox in particular, is simple\nand ingenious. Von Neumann introduces a distinction between membership\nand non-membership and, on this basis, draws a distinction between\nsets and classes. An object is a member (simpliciter) if it\nis a member of some class; and it is a non-member if it is\nnot a member of any class. (Actually, von Neumann develops a theory of\nfunctions, taken as primitive, rather than classes, wherein\ncorresponding to the member/non-member distinction one has a\ndistinction between an object that can be an argument of some function\nand one that cannot. In its modern form, due to Bernays and\n G\u00f6del,\n it is a single-sorted theory of classes.) \n\nSets are then defined as members, and non-members are labeled\n\u201cproper classes.\u201d So for example, the Russell class,\n\\(R\\), cannot be a member of any class, and hence it must be a\nproper class. If \\(R\\) is assumed to be an element of a class\n\\(A\\), then it follows from one of von Neumann\u2019s axioms that\n\\(R\\) is not equivalent to \\(V\\). But \\(R\\) is equivalent to\n\\(V\\), and hence not an element of \\(A\\). Thus, von\nNeumann\u2019s method is closely related to the result stated above\nabout the set \\(R_B\\), for arbitrary \\(B\\). Von\nNeumann\u2019s method, while admired by the likes of G\u00f6del and\nBernays, has been undervalued in recent years. \n\nQuine (1937) and (1967) similarly provide another untyped method (in\nletter if not in spirit) of blocking Russell\u2019s paradox, and one\nthat is rife with interesting anomalies. Quine\u2019s basic idea is\nto introduce a stratified comprehension axiom. In effect, the\naxiom blocks circularity by introducing a hierarchy (or\nstratification) that is similar to type theory in some ways, and\ndissimilar in others. (Details can be found in the entry on\n Quine\u2019s New Foundations.)\n \n\nIn contrast to Zermelo\u2019s, von Neumann\u2019s and Quine\u2019s\nstrategies, which are in a sense purely set theoretic, there have also\nbeen attempts to avoid Russell\u2019s paradox by altering the\nunderlying logic. There have been many such attempts and we shall not\nreview them all, but one stands out as being, at the moment, both\nradical and somewhat popular (although not with set theorists per\nse): this is the paraconsistent approach, which limits\nthe overall effect of an isolated contradiction on an entire theory.\nClassical logic mandates that any contradiction trivializes a theory\nby making every sentence of the theory provable. This is because, in\nclassical logic, the following is a theorem:\n\n(Ex Falso Quadlibet)\u00a0\u00a0  \\(A \\supset({\\sim}A \\supset B).\\)\n\n\nNow, virtually the only way to avoid EFQ is to give up disjunctive\nsyllogism, that is, given the usual definitions of the connectives,\nmodus ponens! So altering basic sentential logic in this way\nis radical indeed \u2013 but possible. Unfortunately, even giving up\nEFQ is not enough to retain a semblance of NC. One also has to give up\nthe following additional theorem of basic sentential logic:\n\n(Contraction)\u00a0\u00a0 \\((A \\supset (A \\supset B)) \\supset (A \\supset B).\\)\n\n\nIt can then be argued that NC leads directly, not merely to an\nisolated contradiction, but to triviality. (For the argument that this\nis so, see the entry on\n Curry\u2019s paradox,\n section 2.2. Note too that it is not enough merely to retain the name\n\u201cmodus ponens\u201d; it is the rule itself that\nbecomes modified within non-traditional logics.) Thus it seems that\nthe woes of NC are not confined to Russell\u2019s paradox but also\ninclude a negation-free paradox due to Curry.\n\nAnother suggestion might be to conclude that the paradox depends upon\nan instance of the principle of Excluded Middle, that either \\(R\\) is\na member of \\(R\\) or it is not. This is a principle that is rejected\nby some non-classical approaches to logic, including\nintuitionism. However it is possible to formulate the paradox without\nappealing to Excluded Middle by relying instead upon the Law of\nNon-contradiction. We do so as follows: Given the definition of \\(R\\)\nit follows that \\(R \\in R \\equiv{\\sim}(R \\in R)\\). So \\(R \\in R\n\\supset{\\sim}(R \\in R)\\). But we also know that \\(R \\in R \\supset R\n\\in R\\). So \\(R \\in R \\supset(R \\in R \\wedge{\\sim}(R \\in R))\\). But by\nthe Law of Non-contradiction we know that \\({\\sim}(R \\in R\n\\wedge{\\sim}(R \\in R))\\). So by modus tollens we conclude\nthat \\({\\sim}(R \\in R)\\). At the same time we also know that since \\(R\n\\in R \\equiv{\\sim}(R \\in R)\\), it follows that \\({\\sim}(R \\in R)\n\\supset R \\in R\\), and thus that \\(R \\in R\\). So we can deduce both\n\\(R \\in R\\) and its negation using only intuitionistically acceptable\nmethods. \n\nIt seems, therefore, that proponents of non-classical logics cannot\nclaim to have preserved NC in any significant sense, other than\npreserving the purely syntactical form of the principle, and neither\nintuitionism nor paraconsistency plus the abandonment of Contraction\nwill offer an advantage over the untyped solutions of Zermelo, von\nNeumann, or Quine. (Further discussion can be found in Meyer, Routley\nand Dunn (1979), Irvine (1992), Priest (2006, ch. 18), Weber (2010),\nWeber (2012), and in the entries on\n Curry\u2019s paradox\n (sec. 2.2) and\n paraconsistent logic\n (sec. 2.3).) \n\nIt is also worth noting that Russell\u2019s paradox was not the only\nparadox that troubled Russell and, hence, not the only motivation for\nthe type restrictions one finds in Principia Mathematica. In\nhis earlier work, The Principles of Mathematics, Russell\ndevotes a chapter to \u201cthe Contradiction\u201d (Russell\u2019s\nparadox), presenting it in several forms and dismissing several\nnon-starter responses. He then signals that he will\n\u201cshortly\u201d discuss the doctrine of types. This\ndoesn\u2019t happen for several hundred pages, until we reach the\nvery end of the book, in Appendix B! There Russell presents an\nincipient, simple theory of types, not the theory of types we find in\nPrincipia Mathematica. Why was the later theory needed? The\nreason is that in Appendix B Russell also presents another paradox\nwhich he thinks cannot be resolved by means of the simple theory of\ntypes. This new paradox concerns propositions, not classes, and it,\ntogether with the semantic paradoxes, led Russell to formulate his\nramified version of the theory of types. \n\nThe new, propositional version of the paradox has not figured\nprominently in the subsequent development of logic and set theory, but\nit sorely puzzled Russell. For one thing, it seems to contradict\nCantor\u2019s theorem. Russell writes: \u201cWe cannot admit that\nthere are more ranges [classes of propositions] than\npropositions\u201d (1903, 527). The reason is that there seem to be\neasy, one to one correlations between classes of propositions and\npropositions. For example, the class \\(m\\) of propositions can be\ncorrelated with the proposition that every proposition in \\(m\\)\nis true. This, together with a fine-grained principle of individuation\nfor propositions (asserting, for one thing, that if the classes\n\\(m\\) and \\(n\\) of propositions differ, then any proposition\nabout \\(m\\) will differ from any proposition about \\(n)\\)\nleads to contradiction. \n\nThere has been relatively little discussion of this paradox, although\nit played a key role in the development of Church\u2019s logic of\nsense and denotation. While we have several set theories to choose\nfrom, we do not have anything like a well-developed theory of\nRussellian propositions, although such propositions are central to the\nviews of Millians and direct-reference theorists. One would think that\nsuch a theory would be required for the foundations of semantics, if\nnot for the foundations of mathematics. Thus, while one of\nRussell\u2019s paradoxes has led to the fruitful development of the\nfoundations of mathematics, his \u201cother\u201d paradox has yet to\nlead to anything remotely similar in the foundations of semantics. To\nbe sure, Church (1974a) and Anderson (1989) have attempted to develop\na Russellian intensional logic based on the ramified theory of types,\nbut an argument can be made that the ramified theory is too\nrestrictive to serve as a foundation for the semantics of natural\nlanguage. There have also been some recent attempts to obtain the\nbeginnings of a Russellian intensional logic based on untyped set\ntheories (Cantini 2004; Deutsch 2014). It is rather ironic that\nalthough fine-grained Russellian propositions are favored in the\nphilosophy of language, the formal development of intensional logic is\ndominated by Montague grammar, with its coarse-grained theory of\npropositions. \n\nIt is also worth noting that a number of seemingly purely\nset-theoretical principles are actually (applied) instances of\ntheorems of pure logic (i.e., of first-order quantification theory\nwith identity)! There is a (partial) list of these in Kalish,\nMontague, and Mar (2000). Russell\u2019s paradox is an instance of\nT269 in this list:\n\n(T269)\u00a0\u00a0 \\({\\sim}\\exists y \\forall x (Fxy \\equiv{\\sim} Fxx).\\)\n\n\nReading the dyadic predicate letter \u201c\\(F\\)\u201d as\n\u201cis a member of\u201d, this says that it is not the case that\nthere is a \\(y\\) such that for any \\(x, x\\) is a\nmember of \\(y\\) if and only if \\(x\\) is not a member of\n\\(x\\). Does this mean that Russell\u2019s paradox reduces to\nT269? \n\nCertainly the proof of T269 distills the essence of Russell\u2019s\nargument, its pattern of reasoning. But that pattern also underwrites\nan endless list of seemingly frivolous \u201cparadoxes\u201d such as\nthe famous paradox of the barber who shaves all and only those who do\nnot shave themselves or, similarly, the paradox of the benevolent but\nefficient God who helps all and only those who do not help themselves.\n\n\nHow do these \u201cpseudo paradoxes,\u201d as they are sometimes\ncalled, differ, if at all, from Russell\u2019s paradox? The pattern\nof reasoning is the same and the conclusion \u2013 that there is no\nsuch Barber, no such efficient God, no such set of non-self-membered\nsets \u2013 is the same: such things simply don\u2019t exist.\n(However, as von Neumann showed, it is not necessary to go quite this\nfar. Von Neumann\u2019s method instructs us not that such things as\n\\(R\\) do not exist, but just that we cannot say much about them,\ninasmuch as \\(R\\) and the like cannot fall into the extension of\nany predicate that qualifies as a class.) \n\nThe standard answer to this question is that the difference lies in\nthe subject matter. Quine asks, \u201cwhy does it [Russell\u2019s\nparadox] count as an antinomy and the barber paradox not?\u201d; and\nhe answers, \u201cThe reason is that there has been in our habits of\nthought an overwhelming presumption of there being such a class but no\npresumption of there being such a barber\u201d (1966, 14). Even so,\npsychological talk of \u201chabits of thought\u201d is not\nparticularly illuminating. More to the point, Russell\u2019s paradox\nsensibly gives rise to the question of what sets there are; but it is\nnonsense to wonder, on such grounds as T269, what barbers or Gods\nthere are! \n\nThis verdict, however, is not quite fair to fans of the Barber or of\nT269 generally. They will insist that the question raised by T269 is\nnot what barbers or Gods there are, but rather what non-paradoxical\nobjects there are. This question is virtually the same as that raised\nby Russell\u2019s paradox itself. Thus, from this perspective, the\nrelation between the Barber and Russell\u2019s paradox is much closer\nthan many (following Quine) have been willing to allow (Salmon 2013).\n\n\nWe note that there is a first-order logical formula that bears the\nsame relation to the principle about the\n\\(R_B\\)\u2019s that T269 bears to Russell\u2019s\nparadox. It is the following:\n\n(T273)\u00a0\u00a0 \n\\(\\forall z \\forall y (\\forall x [Fxy \\equiv (Fxz \\wedge{\\sim} Fxx)] \\supset{\\sim} Fyz).\\)\n\n\n(We have taken the liberty of extending the numbering used in Kalish,\nMontague and Mar (2000) to T273.) But not all set-theoretic paradoxes\nare similarly related to first-order logical theorems. The\nBurali-Forti paradox is an example, since the notion of a\nwell-ordering is not elementary; that is, it is not first-order\ndefinable. \n\nRussell\u2019s paradox has never been pass\u00e9, but recently\nthere has been an explosion of interest in it by scholars involved in\nresearch in mathematical logic and in philosophical and historical\nstudies of modern logic. A glance at the contents of the 2004 volume\nOne Hundred Years of Russell\u2019s Paradox shows prominent\nmathematical and philosophical logicians and historians of logic\nporing over the paradox, proposing new ways back into Cantor\u2019s\nparadise, or other ways of resolving the issue. Their investigations\ninclude radically new ways out of the dilemma posed by the paradox,\nnew studies of the theories of types (simple and ramified, and\nextensions thereof), new interpretations of Russell\u2019s paradox\nand constructive theories, of Russell\u2019s paradox of propositions\nand of his own attempt at an untyped theory (the substitution theory),\nand so forth. \n\nAll of this reminds us that fruitful work can arise from the most\nunlikely of observations. As Dana Scott has put it, \u201cIt is to be\nunderstood from the start that Russell\u2019s paradox is not\nto be regarded as a disaster. It and the related paradoxes show that\nthe na\u00efve notion of all-inclusive collections is untenable. That\n\\(is\\) an interesting result, no doubt about it\u201d (1974,\n207). \n",
