Life and Works\n\nBacon remarks in the Opus tertium [OQHI], written c. 1267 that\nhe had devoted forty years to study since he first learned the\nalphabetum and that no other scholar had worked as much in the\nArts and Sciences as he. Some scholars use this text to argue that\nBacon was writing about his elementary education and therefore that\nwas born c. 1220 [Crowley (1950), Easton (1952), Lindberg (DMS,\n1983)]; others hold that he was writing about his early university\neducation \u2013 Alphabetum philosophiae is a term Bacon uses\nin the chapter from which the following cited text is taken \u2013\nand thus that he was born c. 1214 [Little (RBE, 1914), Maloney (CSTM,\n1988), Hackett (2016), Molland (2004)]. The text reads:\n\n\nI have labored much in sciences and languages, and I have up to now\ndevoted forty years [to them] after I first learned the\nalphabetum; and I was always studious. Apart from two of these\nforty years I was always [engaged] in study [or at a place of study],\nand I had many expenses just as others commonly have... And it is\nknown that no one worked in so many sciences and languages as I did,\nnor so much as I did. Indeed, when I was living in the other state of\nlife [as an Arts Master], people marveled that I survived the\nabundance of my work. And still, I was just as involved in studies\nafterwards, as I had been before. But I did not work all that much,\nsince in the pursuit of Wisdom this was not required. ([OQHI], 65)\n\n\nSome time after 1248, he set aside the common scholastic ways of\nteaching in order to devote time to languages and experimental\nconcerns. Thus, we can see the period from c. 1240\u201348 as the\ntime during which he lectured at Paris on Aristotle, on Grammar/Logic,\nand especially on the mathematical subjects of the Quadrivium.\nAnd so, depending on the chosen year of birth, the chronology would be\nas follows: (1) Bacon was born c. 1214, educated at Oxford c.\n1228\u201336, Master of Arts at Paris c. 1237\u201347/8, Private\nScholar 1248\u201356/7, active again at Oxford c. 1248\u201351, back\nin Paris 1251, Franciscan Friar at Paris c. 1256\u201357 to 1279,\nreturning to Oxford c. 1280, died c. 1292. Or: (2) Bacon was born c.\n1220, educated at Oxford c. 1234\u201342; Master of Arts at Paris c.\n1242\u201347/8, active again at Oxford c. 1248\u201351, back in\nParis 1251, Franciscan Friar at Paris 1256/7 to 1279, returning to\nOxford c. 1280, died c. 1292. Further precision on the chronology must\nawait the critical edition of all the works of Roger Bacon and careful\nscientific study of these works in relation to other thirteenth\ncentury scholars.\n\nThe Aristotelian Quaestiones are to be found in a single\nmanuscript, Amiens MS Bibl. Mun. 406. The materials found in this\nmanuscript include two sets of questions on the Physics and two\nsets of questions on the Metaphysics of Aristotle, the\nquestions on the Liber de causis, and the Pseudo-Aristotelian\nDe vegetabilibus. As noted above, three of the questions on the\nPhysics and Metaphysics can now be excluded from Bacon\u2019s canon.\nA new version of Bacon\u2019s second set of questions on the\nPhysics inter-textually excerpted by another thirteenth-century\nauthor has recently been identified by Silvia Donati in Philadelphia\nMS Free Library, Lewis Europe, ff. 77ra-85rb (Donati 1997). This is an\nimportant discovery that has enabled scholars for the first time to\ncarry out a critical-textual study of Bacon\u2019s works on\nAristotle\u2019s Physics in the context of the development of\nEnglish natural philosophy in the period 1240\u20131300.\n\nThe early logical works consist of the Summa grammatica,\nSumma de sophismatibus et distinctionibus and the Summulae\ndialectices [=Summulae super totam logicam]. These works\nshow that Bacon is indebted to the teaching of logic at Oxford and\nParis in the 1230s and 1240s. They have received much critical study\nin recent years. They reveal Bacon as a mature philosopher of logic\nwho is representative of terminist and pre-modist grammar and logic.\nBacon\u2019s writings on grammar and logic have a connection with the\nOxford ascribed Logica cum sit nostra and with the works of\nWilliam of Sherwood. The logical works are clearly influenced by the\nteaching in Paris of Robert Kilwardby. They give evidence of Bacon as\na philosopher who connects the Logica modernorum with new\nlogical and philosophical problems based on the natural philosophy and\nmetaphysics of Aristotle as commented on by Avicenna and Averroes.\n\nAlain de Libera has argued that the Summulae dialectices is\ntypical of mature works in the philosophy of logic c. 1250 and a\nlittle later. If this is the case, can we exclude the possibility that\nBacon continued teaching at some University up to ca. 1256/57? He does\nsay that he had a reputation as a scholar and teacher up to that time.\nScholars have long held that Roger Bacon was a pioneer in the\nintroduction of the study of Aristotle as interpreted by Averroes and\nAvicenna to the University of Paris c. 1240. But to this we must add\nthe name of Solomon Ibn Gebirol (Avicebron). During the past ten years\nor so, research has shown that two Erfurt manuscripts (Amplon. Q. 290\nand Q. 312) ascribed to Walter Burley (1274/5\u20131344) by the\nAmplonius de Berka in the fifteenth century, actually belong to the\nfirst half of the thirteenth century. Rega Wood, the editor of the\nPhysics from the Erfurt MS Amplon. Q 290, has attributed these\nquestions on the Physics and most of the other works in these\ntwo Erfurt manuscripts to Richard Rufus of Cornwall, a contemporary\nand opponent of Roger Bacon [Wood 1997; Wood, IPA, 2003].\n\nRecently, it has also been demonstrated that as Master of Arts at\nParis during the period of the First Averroism (c. 1240\u201348),\nBacon had confronted and reviewed some of the major issues concerning\nthe Latin Averroism which eventually produced a major crisis at Paris\nin the period 1266\u201377 (Hackett 2005). And, as we will see below,\nBacon, in his works from the 1260s, will revisit these topics.\n\nBacon joined the Franciscan Order about 1256/7; whether he did so at\nOxford or Paris is not known. At any rate, he was probably in Paris in\nthe late 1250s and was definitely there in the early 1260s. He had\nbeen attracted to the Order by the philosophical, theological, and\nscientific example of Grosseteste, Adam Marsh, and other English\nFranciscans. He had personally known Adam Marsh at Oxford c.\n1248\u201351. Because of their over-emphasis of a purported\ncondemnation of Bacon c. 1278, scholars had tended to ignore or tone\ndown Bacon\u2019s very real commitment to his Franciscan way of life.\nThe past ten years have seen new work by Amanda Power (2013) and\nTimothy J. Johnson (2009, 2010, 2013) emphasize the compatibility of\nBacon\u2019s concerns c. 1266 with the mission of the Franciscan\nOrder as presented by Bonaventure and the Franciscan School at Paris.\n\n\nIn answer to the Papal Mandate received in July 1266, Bacon produced\nsome very significant works. The Opus maius, Opus minus,\nand the related foundational work in natural philosophy, De\nmultiplicatione specierum, the work on burning mirrors, De\nspeculis comburentibus, together with an optical lens, were sent\nto the Pope c. 1267\u201368. They were seen as a preamble to a\nproposed major work on Philosophy. It remains a question as to whether\nthe Opus tertium was sent. Together with these works in the\n1260s, Bacon produced the Preface to the Works for the Pope,\nCommunia naturalium, Communia mathematica, Epistola\nde secretis operibus naturae et de nullitate magiae.\n\nAmanda Power (2013) has provided a masterful interpretation of the new\ncontext of Bacon\u2019s post-1266 works for Pope Clement IV. She\nplaces Bacon in a Franciscan context within the wider mission of\nChristendom in its relations with other cultures and religions. The\nCompendium studii philosophiae can be dated to about 1271. This\nlatter is a largely polemical work on the state of studies at Paris\nand an apology for his scholarly situation. It does, however, contain\nan important section on his theory of language and translation. He\ncompleted the edition of the important work on medieval politics and\nstatecraft, the Secretum secretorum, at Oxford some time after\n1280. It is clear that by 1266 and later, this important work played a\nmajor role in Bacon\u2019s understanding of the political uses of the\nexperimental sciences. He also produced an important work on the\ncalendar, the Computus. The Compendium studii theologiae\nis usually dated c. 1292, but its content does not differ from the\nconcerns of the work in 1266. \n\nOne must bear in mind that Roger Bacon in the 1260s is writing as an\nindividual author for a patron, Cardinal Guy le Gros de Foulque (Pope\nClement IV, 1265\u201368). A onetime Master of Arts, he was no longer\na teaching Master at the University of Paris. This gave Bacon the\nfreedom to address both philosophical (Aristotle) and theological\n(Augustine) issues in a manner denied to teachers in the Faculty of\nArts, who were limited for the most part to disputations on the texts\nof Aristotle. He writes self-consciously as a representative of the\ntext-based practices of Robert Grosseteste and in opposition to the\nnew \u201csentence-methods\u201d of the schools of theology. His\npolemical writings ca. 1267\u201368 are centered on the struggles in\nthe Arts and Theology at Paris. The Pope instructed Bacon in 1266 to\nignore the rules of his Order and to send him his remedies about\nmatters of some importance. It would appear from the context of\nBacon\u2019s works for the Pope that the remedies had to do with\neducational matters at Paris, which at this time was the foremost\nuniversity of the Christian commonwealth. The remedies sought must\nalso have concerned geo-political matters as well as the exigencies of\nChristian missions. \n\nThe reception of the life and works of Roger Bacon is complex. Each\ngeneration has, as it were, found its own Roger Bacon. Another study\nby Amanda Power (2006) has provided a thoughtful account of the\ncomplex reception of Roger Bacon in England and of the extent to which\nthe image of the Doctor Mirabilis is often colored by the\nchanging controversies of the present down through history.\n",
