    "main_text": "Buddhist Influences and the Neo-Confucian Epistemology || General Overview\n4.1 General Overview\n\nEpistemology was the leading field of progress in Song-ming\nNeo-Confucianism (Wen 2011: 271). Its systematic discussion began\nafter the Buddhist philosophy reached its high point in China. The\nBuddhist distinction between the subjective perception (neng\n\u80fd) and the objects of comprehension within external reality\n(suo \u6240) influenced already the ear\u00adli\u00adest precursors of\nthis intellectual stream, such as for instance Shao Yong\n(1011\u20131077). However, in this context the most influential\nstream of thought was Chan-Buddhism (Chan \u79aa). In\ncontrast to other schools of Chinese Buddhism, for example the School\nof Pure Consciousness (Wei shi zong\n\u552f\u8b58\u5b97), the Tiantai (Tian tai zong\n\u5929\u53f0\u5b97 ) and the Huayan (Huayan zong\n\u83ef\u56b4\u5b97) schools, Chan discarded traditional Indian\nmethods of realizing the Buddha-nature and proposed a teaching of\nenlightenment in accordance with Chinese philosophical sensibility.\nIts adherents, especially its last patriarch Hui Neng (638\u2013713)\nexposed the possibility of enlightening humans without the use of\nwords. The central topic of interest within this context shifted from\ntrying to understand what the world was, to understanding the world\nand Buddha\u2019s wisdom. Since the latter issue falls within the\nscope of understanding a certain kind of knowledge, this discourse\nrepresented an innovative shift from metaphysics to epistemology.\n\nIn this shift of philosophical paradigms, Chan Buddhism infused the\nrelationship between heart-mind and things-events with a distinct\nsensibility that derived from classical Chinese discourses: the\ncontinuity of heart-mind and things-events (Wen 2011: 272). In this\nway, the Chan teachings synthesized earlier Buddhist and classical\nChinese epistemology, which provided a starting point for the\nNeo-Confucian epistemology.\n\nAccording to Wen Haiming (2011: 271), the general line of development\nin solipsistic epistemology could be drawn as follows: the\nepistemology of Chan Buddhism and Li Ao\u2019s (772\u2013841) study\nof \u201crecovering human nature\u201d (fu xing\n\u5fa9\u6027) provided the foundations for Neo-Confucian\nepis\u00adte\u00admol\u00ado\u00adgy; Zhou Dunyi\u2019s (1017\u20131073) concept of\ncreativity (cheng \u8aa0) and his epistemological\nstructure linking the Great Ultimate (taiji \u592a\u6975)\nwith the Great Ultimate of Humans (renji \u4eba\u6975),\nas well as Shao Yong\u2019s teaching of observing things\n(guan wu \u89c0\u7269) comprehensively raised the basic\nquestions of this new discourse; Zhang Zai\u2019s (1020\u20131077)\nparadigm of expanding one\u2019s heart-mind to be continuous with\nthings (da xin ti wu \u5927\u5fc3\u9ad4\u7269)\nand Cheng Hao\u2019s (1032\u20131085) elaborations on stilling\nthe nature (ding xin \u5b9a\u6027) served as the\nbasic frameworks and major discourses for Neo-Confucian epistemology;\nCheng Yi\u2019s \u7a0b\u9824 (1033\u20131107) study of\nHeavenly patterns (tian li \u5929\u7406) and Zhu\nXi\u2019s (1130\u20131200) Exploration of things\n(gewu) reached their first peak in this new epistemology of\nthe Song and Ming periods; after them, another peak was reached in Lu\nJiuyuan\u2019s (1139\u20131192) and Wang Yangming\u2019s agreement\nthat nothing is outside one\u2019s mind (wu xinwaizhi\nwu \u7121\u5fc3\u5916\u4e4b\u7269). The final stage of\nNeo-Confucian breakthroughs in the epistemology field can be found in\nWang Ji\u2019s (1498\u20131583) concept of intentional\npropensity (ji \u5e7e) and Liu Zongzhou\u2019s\n(1578\u20131645) teaching on intention as the root\n(yigen \u610f\u6839) of the heart-mind.\n",
