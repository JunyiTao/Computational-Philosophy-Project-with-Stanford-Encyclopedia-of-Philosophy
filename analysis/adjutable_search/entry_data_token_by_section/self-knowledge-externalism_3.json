    "main_text": "The Reductio to Armchair Knowledge of the External World || Reply 2: Externalism about Empty Concepts\n2.2 Reply 2: Externalism about Empty Concepts\n\nStill, it may remain intuitively compelling that a Twin Earth thought\nexperiment, if cogent, would show (1) apriori\u2014even if E\nis just the condition where water\n exists.[13]\n For the experiments seem to show apriori that, to have the bona fide\nwater concept, the concept must be non-empty, i.e., its\nreferent must exist. However, a compatibilist can counter this by\noffering a semantics of empty concepts that is consonant with EXT\n(Stoneham 1999, Sawyer 2003, Goldberg 2006b, Haukioja 2006, Parent\n2017, ch. 4; see also Pryor 2007, pp. 184\u2013185). Even so, there\nare two arguments in the literature suggesting that any externalist\nview of empty concepts must fail (Boghossian 1997; 1998, Segal 2000,\nBesson 2012).\n\nOn its face, empty-concept externalism can be supported by a Twin\nEarth thought experiment (Boghossian\n 1997).[14]\n Consider \u201cDry Earth\u201d\u2014a planet exactly like ours,\nexcept wherever water occurs on Earth, there are only watery looking\nholograms (though Dry Earthians mistake these for a real kind). The\nintuition is that unlike Oscar, Dry Oscar uses \u2018water\u2019 to\nexpress an empty concept. And if Dry Oscar is not referring to water,\nthen as before, the Frege-Carnap view implies that his concept has a\ndifferent intension or content. So even for empty concepts, content\nseems determined partly by facts about the environment (including\nfacts about what is absent from the environment).\n\nHowever, carrying this further may lead to absurdity, since\nexternalism about empty concepts can suggest that a concept\u2019s\nform is sensitive to the environment (Boghossian 1997; 1998).\nSuppose, as is plausible, that empty concepts have a\ndescriptive form\u2014so that (e.g.) the unicorn concept is\nunderstood as the concept \u201chorse with a horn.\u201d For most\nexternalists, this contrasts with our concept of water which does not\nhave a descriptive form, but is rather atomic. If that is correct,\nthen Dry Oscar expresses a descriptive concept when using\n\u2018water\u2019, whereas Oscar expresses an atomic one. In which\ncase, the environmental difference creates a difference in\nform as well as content. But that is strange, since form\nseems to be a purely syntactic matter, fixed entirely by what\u2019s\nin the head.\n\nAt least one compatibilist has tried embracing environment-dependent\nsyntax, though he concedes it is an uncomfortable view (Ludlow 2003;\n2011). At the least, such a stance would seem ad hoc (Besson 2012).\nOthers question the \u201csupervenience principle\u201d in the\nargument, viz., that a difference in form necessitates a difference in\ninternal state (Corb\u00ed 1998, Brown 1999, Korman 2006, Parent\n2015a, 2017, ch. 4). Further argument has been offered for this\nprinciple (Boghossian 1998), yet such arguments may beg the question\nby presupposing a Chomskian, internalist notion of logical form\n(Parent 2015a, 2017, ch. 4\u007f).\n\nHowever this issue unfolds, externalism about empty concepts faces a\nfurther challenge (Segal 2000, pp. 54\u201356). Consider: Either the\nexternalist sees the unicorn-concept as necessarily empty or\n not.[15]\n If the former, then the view implies that unicorns are impossible\nobjects, like round squares. And that is rather counterintuitive (yet\nsee Kripke 1972 on unicorns). But taking the other horn (sorry), a\ncontingently empty concept would have its content fixed by descriptors\nlike \u201chorse with a horn.\u201d In this case, EXT seems false.\nFor the constancy of the descriptors guarantees that the concept has\nthe same content in every possible world, whether or not it contains\nunicorns (Segal 2000; see also Besson 2012).
