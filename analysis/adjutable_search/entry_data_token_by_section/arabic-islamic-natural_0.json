    "main_text": "The Atomism of Kal\u0101m || Atoms and Accidents\n1.1 Atoms and Accidents\n\nAlthough some early Muslim theologians maintained that there are\nbasically only accidents and that bodies are composites of bundles of\naccidents, while others held that there are only corporeal bodies and\nthat everything else is constituted out of the interpenetration of\nthese bodies, most Muslim theologians included both\n atoms[1]\n and accidents in their ontology and additionally God. One way that\nthis ontology was justified was to begin with a proof for the world\u2019s\ntemporal creation. It was argued that if the world were not created,\nthen an infinite number of past days would have been traversed;\nhowever, it was held as self-evident that an infinite, let alone\ntraversing it, is impossible. Thus the world must have been created at\nsome first moment. In that case, however, the world must have a\nCreator. Thus there is what creates, namely, God, and what is created.\nWhat is created was divided further into what occupies space, namely,\nsubstances or atoms, and what does not, namely, accidents.\n\nOccupying space (tah\u0323ayyuz) was for the Muslim theologians the\nnecessary result of any thing\u2019s being a substance, and it was this\nattribute of occupying space that confirmed the existence of\nsubstances; for occupying space was held to be an attribute that was\ndirectly perceived by the senses and as such could not be gainsaid.\nThus that substances exist was a matter of direct knowledge. Most\nMuslim theologians additionally maintained that these substances also\nhave an atomic structure. This is not to say that they thought humans\ncould directly perceive an individual atom taken in\nisolation\u2014they did not; however, they believed that one could\ndemonstrate that the ultimate material constituents of the world must\nbe discrete rather than continuous. In general, their arguments for\natomic rather than continuous substances used paradoxes involving the\ninfinite. For example, it was argued that if a body were continuous,\nthen it would be divisible infinitely, in which case the body would\nhave an actually infinite number of parts that all adhere together to\nform the body and that correspond with the infinite number of\ndivisions. The existence of an actual infinite is absurd, however, and\nso the division of the body must terminate at a finite number of\nindivisible parts or atoms. It does no good to say that the body has\nonly a potentially infinite number of parts corresponding to the\ndivisions rather than an actually infinite number; for it was argued\nthat if something is truly potential, then some agent, such as God,\nmust have the power to bring about or actualize that potentiality.\nThus, let God bring about the purportedly potentially infinite number\nof divisions, in which case there would be an actually infinite number\nof parts, which again is absurd. Similarly, it is of no avail to say\nthat the divisions are neither actual nor potential, but only\nimagined, since what is truly impossible cannot be imagined, and the\nexistence of an actual infinite, it was believed, is truly impossible.\nAnother argument for the atomic structure of matter was a variation on\nZeno\u2019s dichotomy paradox, couched in terms of an ant\u2019s creeping over a\nsandal. If a body were continuous, the argument runs, then should an\nant attempt to cross a sandal, it would first need to reach the\nhalfway point on the sandal, but before it could reach the halfway\npoint, it would need to reach its halfway point and so on infinitely.\nSince an infinite cannot be traversed, the ant could never cross the\nsandal, but of course a body such as a sandal can be crossed, and thus\nbodies cannot be continuous, but must be composed of a finite number\nof atomic parts. Yet another argument observed that differences in\nsize are accounted for by difference in the number of constituent\nparts that make up the body. Now if bodies were continuous and so\ncomposed of an infinite number of parts, then the number of parts\nconstituting a mustard seed and the number of parts constituting a\nmountain would be the same, namely, infinite. Consequently the two\nbodies should not differ in size; for one infinite cannot exceed\nanother, and yet such a conclusion is patently false. In the end, most\nIslamic speculative theologians concluded that the matter constituting\nthe cosmos must be discrete rather than continuous.\n\nScholars have varied, however, concerning whether the indivisible\nparts posited in the physics of these theologians should be viewed as\nextended or point-like. Shlomo Pines argued that although later Muslim\ntheologians took atoms to have a certain measure and so were\nconsidered extended, earlier theologians conceived of them as points.\nPines wrote his groundbreaking study of Islamic atomism,\nBeitr\u00e4ge zur islamischen Atomenlehre, in 1936; however,\nsince then more kal\u0101m texts have become available. In light\nof these new sources, Alnoor Dhanani (Dhanani 1994, 90\u2013140) has\nsuccessfully challenged Pines\u2019 suggestion and argued in its place that\nthe atoms of both early and later Muslim theologians are akin to\nEpicurean minimal\n parts.[2]\n In this respect, the atom is the minimal space-occupying unit having\na wholly simple internal structure. As such the atom has neither\nphysical nor conceptual features into which it could be divided. As a\nresult of this understanding of atoms, although they function as the\ncomponents of the various magnitudes composed of them, such as lines,\nplanes and solids, they technically cannot be said to have length,\nwidth and depth; for length, width and depth are always bounded by\nextremities, whereas atoms simply cannot have any extremities, but\ninstead play the role of the extremities themselves of those things\nthat possess length, breadth and depth.\n\nAtoms in themselves again are space occupying; however, among created\nthings the Muslim theologians also posited things that were in\nthemselves not space occupying, but rather inhered in atoms. Things of\nthis latter sort are the so-called \u2018accidents.\u2019 Muslim\ntheologians had argued for the existence of accidents from the fact\nthat atoms as such are similar or homogeneous, and so if there are\nperceptible differences among bodies (and there clearly are such\ndifferences), those differences must be due to differences among the\naccidents that inhere in the atoms. The Muslim theologians then went\non to identify no less than twenty-two different kinds of accidents,\nwhich include the obvious ones such as taste, color and smell as well\nas adhesion, force, power and willing, but also less obvious ones such\nas life and ceasing to exist.\n",
