    "main_text": "Epistemology\n3. Ethics\n\nSpeusippus certainly wrote about ethics: the bibliography in Diogenes\nlists (in iv 4) one book each on wealth, pleasure, justice, and\nfriendship. But we have nothing that can be properly called a\nfragment.\n\nWe have already seen that Speusippus rejected Plato\u2019s Theory of Forms,\nand that he refused to place the good among the metaphysical first\nprinciples. So he was not obviously prone to the objections of\nAristotle against Platonic ethics in Nicomachean Ethics I 6,\nthe general upshot of which is that Plato\u2019s theory puts the Good out\nof human reach.\n\nSpeusippus appears to have adopted a rather down-to-earth goal, and in\nthis he is a lead-in to Hellenistic concerns. Hellenistic ethics is\ndominated by the identification of the ideal of human happiness as\n\u2018undisturbedness\u2019 (ataraxia). According to\nClement, Stromata II 22, 133 (St\u00e4hlin 1939 p.\n186.19\u201323):\n\n\nSpeusippus, Plato\u2019s nephew, says that happiness is the completed state\nin things that hold by nature, or possession of goods, for which\ncondition all men have desire, while the good ones aim at\nuntroubledness (aochlesia). And the excellences are\nproductive of happiness.\n\n\nThese formulations \u2018anticipate\u2019 Stoic and Epicurean ones:\nthe emphasis on \u2018natural\u2019 conditions is a feature of\nStoicism, and the notion of \u2018untroubledness\u2019 is found in\nEpicurus (see To Menoeceus, in Diogenes Laertius x 127).\n\nThere is an argument implicit in the clause \u201cfor which all men\nhave desire, while the good ones aim at untroubledness\u201d that\nfits in perfectly with a debate about the good and happiness that we\nknow from Aristotle to have been current in the Academy, and in which\nSpeusippus played a leading role. Nicomachean Ethics X 2\nbegins (1172b9\u201310):\n\n\nEudoxus, then, thought pleasure to be the good because he saw all\nthings, both rational and irrational, aiming at it, \u2026. \n\n\nThis sort of \u2018Universal Pursuit Argument\u2019 is one that\nbecame very popular in the Hellenistic period; here we have Eudoxus\napplying it in favor of the claim that pleasure is the good:\n\u2018hedonism\u2019. And Speusippus strenuously denied hedonism\n(see below).\n\nWe might, then, see Speusippus responding to the Universal Pursuit\nArgument construed as favoring hedonism by saying: we should not care\nabout what all things in general aim at, but at what human\nbeings aim at, in fact, more specifically, the good ones\namong them, and what human beings pursue is not pleasure, but the\ncompleted state in things that hold by nature, and the good\nones, more specifically, pursue untroubledness. The word\n\u2018untroubledness\u2019, aochlesia, comes from a verb\nochleein that can just mean \u2018to move\u2019, so\nuntroubledness might well suggest a certain stillness, lack of motion.\nThis will fit with Speusippus\u2019 views on pleasure and pain.\n\nBefore we turn to those, we have a little more with which to flesh out\nSpeusippus\u2019 idea of the good for man; none of it, regrettably, is\nsupplied with argument.\n\nCicero, in various places, ascribes a view to \u201cAristotle,\nSpeusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon\u201d which he himself rejects.\nIn the Tusculan Disputations he enumerates (V x 29) various\nthings such as poverty, ingloriousness, loneliness, pain, ill health,\netc., which many people (but not he: his own view is the Stoic one\nthat virtue all by itself guarantees happiness) take to be bad things,\nand then says (V x 30, King 1927 pp. 454/455\u2013456/457):\n\n\nTherefore I do not easily give in to \u2026 those ancients,\nAristotle, Speusippus, Xenocrates, and Polemon, since they count the\nthings I have enumerated above among the bad things, and these very\npeople say that the wise man is always happy.\n\n\nCicero is, in the last clause, accusing these people of inconsistency:\nthey think the wise man is always happy, and yet they think there are\nthings such as wealth and health the lack of which would bring about\nunhappiness.\n\nSeneca (Epistulae morales 85.18, Reynolds 1965 i 292, Gummere\n1920 pp. 294, 295) says:\n\n\nXenocrates and Speusippus think that one can become happy even by\nvirtue alone, but not that there is one good, that is morality\n(honestum). \n\n\nThis can be seen as expressive of the same reservation Cicero had. If\nSpeusippus and Xenocrates espoused the view that the virtuous man was\nalways happy but thought that there were non-moral evils such as\npoverty and pain, then they thought that there were non-moral good\nthings as well: the absence of poverty and the absence of pain. So (on\nCicero\u2019s and Seneca\u2019s account) they were not consistent in maintaining\nthat virtue (which incorporates only moral goods) was sufficient for\nhappiness.\n\nAnd it appears that Speusippus and Xenocrates did think that there\nwere non-moral goods; Plutarch, in De communibus notitiis adversus\nStoicos 13. 1065a (Cherniss 1976 pp. 704, 705) refers to\nSpeusippus and Xenocrates as \u201cthinking that health is not\nindifferent and wealth not useless\u201d.\n\nWe are left with two views to ascribe to Speusippus (and to\nXenocrates): that wisdom, or virtue in general, is sufficient for\nhappiness, and that there are non-moral goods the lack of which\nconduces to unhappiness. Cicero\u2019s question as to how these can be\nrendered consistent is a good one, and we have no information about\nhow Speusippus might have answered it.\n\nLet us turn to the one other topic about which we have some purchase\non Speusippus\u2019 ethical views: that of pleasure. Aulus Gellius,\nAtticae noctes IX v 4 (Marshall 1968 p. 284, Rolfe 1927 pp.\n168, 169):\n\n\nSpeusippus and the entire old Academy say that pleasure and pain are\ntwo evils opposed to each other, but that the good is what is in the\nmiddle between the two. \n\n\nThe inclusion of the rest of the Academy along with Speusippus is\npresumably due to the influence of Cicero\u2019s teacher Antiochus\u2019\nunifying efforts. At any rate, there is confirmation that this was\nSpeusippus\u2019 view, from two passages in Aristotle\u2019s Nicomachean\nEthics: VII 13, which names Speusippus, and X 2. 1173a5\u201313,\nwhich does not, but repeats the argument of the former passage.\n\nIn the first of those chapters (in 1153b1\u20137) Aristotle mentions\nSpeusippus as having attacked the claim that pleasure is something\ngood. He had canvassed arguments to the effect that pleasure is a bad\nthing earlier in the chapter, and some of the arguments certainly\nsound like Speusippus (1152b12\u201320):\n\n\nAnd so, in favor of the claim that pleasure is not a good at all, it\nis argued (1) that every pleasure is a perceptible coming-to-be toward\na natural state, while no coming-to-be is of the same kind as its\nends, e.g. no house-building is of the same kind as a house. (2)\nAgain, the temperate man avoids pleasures. (3) Again, the intelligent\nman pursues what is painless, not what is pleasant. (4) Again,\npleasures are a hindrance to reflecting, and by as much as one enjoys\nthem, by that much are they more of a hindrance, as with the pleasure\nof sex; for no one could think in the course of that. (5) Again, there\nis no art of pleasure, although everything good is the work of an art.\n(6) Again, children and wild animals pursue pleasures. \n\n\nAssuming that we correctly understood Speusippus\u2019 response to the\nUniversal Pursuit Argument, (2), (3), and (6) are consonant with that\nresponse.\n\nBut (1) plainly echoes material in Plato\u2019s Philebus (see esp.\n53c\u201355a). And that leads to the interesting suggestion that in\nthat dialogue Plato is entering the dispute between Eudoxus and\nSpeusippus. It has been suggested independently of that passage that\nSpeusippus is lurking behind the \u2018harsh thinkers\u2019, the\nanti-hedonists, of 44a-47b (Schofield 1971, Dillon 1996).\n\nIf that is right, and if Graeser\u2019s suggestion that Plato in the\nParmenides is responding to some of Speusippus\u2019 metaphysical\nviews, it is plain that the understanding of some of what is going on\nin late Plato would be aided by an understanding of what was going on\nin Speusippus. The loss of his writings is regrettable indeed.\n",
