    "main_text": "Conventionalist Theories of Depiction\n2. Conventionalist Theories of Depiction\n\nResemblance theories of depiction differ from one another in\nsignificant ways. But they agree on the following crucial point: the\nfundamental difference between pictorial and linguistic representation\nconsists in the fact that the former depends on resemblances between\nrepresentations and the objects they represent, whereas the latter\ndoes not. It is widely agreed that linguistic representation depends\non conventions that create the vocabulary of a language and the\nsemantically significant structures in which the elements of its\nvocabulary are combined. But the contribution words and structures\nmake to the meaning of a sentence are hardly ever explained by\nresemblance. If there are exceptions, such as onomatopoeia, they\nconfirm the rule.\n\nArt theorists such as Roman Jakobson challenged this division between\npictorial art and language early in the twentieth century (Jakobson\n[1921/1971] 1987), reacting against what were thought of as\nillusionistic styles of painting. Once it was understood that artistic\nstyles are comparable to languages or codes, it was thought, artists\nwould feel freer to abandon academic conventions, to follow\n\u201cprimitive\u201d models, and to participate in the fauvist and\ncubist experiments of Matisse, Picasso, and Braque (Bois 1987).\nConventionalism was well established by the 1950s. For example, the\nfollowing remark appears in an article by the American art historian\nLeo Steinberg entitled \u201cThe Eye Is a Part of the Mind\u201d,\nwhich anticipates Gombrich\u2019s and Goodman\u2019s stance on the\n\u201cinnocent eye\u201d (see above\n \u00a71.1):\n\n\n\u201cTechnical capacity in the imitation of nature\u201d simply\ndoes not exist. What does exist is the skill of reproducing handy\ngraphic symbols for natural appearances, of rendering familiar facts\nby set professional conventions. (Steinberg [1953] 1972: 198\n\n\nHowever, the first attempt to defend a conventionalist theory of art\nsystematically and in detail was made in Goodman\u2019s book\nLanguages of Art.\n\nGoodman accepts that pictures may resemble the objects they depict,\nbut he denies that this explains why they depict them:\n\n\nA picture that represents\u2014like a passage that describes\u2014an\nobject refers to and, more particularly, denotes it. Denotation is the\ncore of representation and is independent of resemblance. (1968:\n5)\n\n\nGoodman does not define denotation, beyond describing it as a variety\nof reference, but two features of his conception of denotation should\nbe noted. First, it is supposed to be the relation in which a name\nstands to its bearer, or a predicate stands to the members of its\nextension, or a portrait stands to its subject. Hence the\ncontroversial doctrine that predicates and names have the same\nsemantic function is implicit in Goodman\u2019s theory of depiction\n(Geach 1972; Strawson 1976; Hyman 2006: 185\u2013190). Second,\nGoodman\u2019s nominalist theory of properties excludes the\npossibility that a symbol denotes an object because it resembles it\n(Arrell 1987: 42). For he does not merely make the uncontroversial\nobservation that an object is gray if and only if \u201cgray\u201d\napplies to it, he claims that the properties an object has depends\non what predicates apply to it (Goodman 1968: 51, 54\u201355).\nIn other words, \u201cgray\u201d does not denote an object because\nit has the property of being gray; on the contrary, it has the\nproperty because \u201cgray\u201d denotes it. Equally, the same\npredicates do not denote different individuals because they resemble\neach other, or have properties in common. On the contrary, they\nresemble each other, or have properties in common, because the same\npredicates denote them. Hence, resemblance is explained by, and\ntherefore cannot itself explain, denotation.\n\nAccording to Goodman, pictorial symbol systems differ from linguistic\nones in being analog and relatively replete, an\nanalog system being one that is syntactically and\nsemantically dense. (For reasons of space we shall not\ndiscuss the relationship between analog and dense;\nsee Lewis 1971 and Haugeland 1981.) A pictorial system is\nsyntactically dense because it provides for a dense set of\npictorial characters, in other words, a set containing infinitely many\npictures \u201cso ordered that between each two there is a\nthird\u201d (Goodman 1968: 136), and it is semantically\ndense because it provides for a dense set of classes of denotata.\n(By contrast, the Arabic numeral system for denoting the natural\nnumbers provides for infinitely many characters\u2014\u201c1\u201d,\n\u201c2\u201d, \u201c3\u201d \u2026, \u201c11\u201d,\n\u201c12\u201d, \u201c13\u201d \u2026, etc.\u2014but there is a\n\u201cgap\u201d between each numeral and its successor, and between\neach of the corresponding natural numbers and its successor:\nthe system is articulate, not dense.) Finally, a\npictorial system is relatively replete because relatively\nmany properties of a picture are relevant to its interpretation:\n\n\nAny thickening or thinning of the line, its colour, its contrast with\nthe background, its size, even the qualities of the paper-none of\nthese is ruled out, none can be ignored. (Goodman 1968: 229)\n\n\nThus, whereas different instances of the same written letter, word or\nsentence can differ widely in appearance, pictures that differ in\nappearance, in any one of many different ways, and however small the\ndifference is, will also differ in what they represent.\n\nThus, Goodman\u2019s principal claims are these:\n\nDepictions differ from descriptions in belonging to symbol systems\nthat are analog/dense and relatively replete.\nDepictions and descriptions are equally \u201cartificial\u201d,\n\u201carbitrary\u201d, or \u201cconventional\u201d (1968:\n230\u2013231).\nDenotation is the core of representation, including\ndepiction.\n\n\nAll three claims have been contested.\n\nThe first difficulty with (1) is that a set is dense only relative to\nan ordering. For example, the set of natural numbers can be given a\ndense ordering, but it is not dense in the familiar 1, 2, 3, \u2026\nordering. In the first edition of Languages of Art, Goodman\ndoes not explain what ordering of pictures he has in mind, but in the\nrevised edition he states that\n\n\nthe ordering in question is understood to be such that any element\nlying between two others is less discriminable from each of them than\nthey are from each other. (1976: 136)\n\n\nThis raises two questions. First, is an ordering of pictures of this\nkind possible? Second, Goodman\u2019s ordering appears to depend on\ndegrees of resemblance, albeit between signs as opposed to between\nsigns and denotata. But is this reintroduction of the concept of\nresemblance compatible with his nominalist theory of properties and\nhis attack on the doctrine of the \u201cinnocent eye\u201d?\n\nThe second difficulty with (1) is that digital photographs would\nnormally be classified as pictures along with analog ones (Bach 1970;\nKulvicki 2006); and some diagrams, which would not normally\nbe classified as pictures, are analog and relatively replete (Peacocke\n1987). Furthermore, outline drawings are less replete than diagrams in\nwhich not only shape but also colour affects what they represent, but\nthe former would normally be classified as pictures, whereas the\nlatter would not (Schier 1986; Kulvicki 2006). Goodman acknowledges\nthat \u201csome old and vague boundaries are transgressed, some\nsignificant new alliances and alienations effected\u201d by the\nclassification of symbol systems he defends (1968: 232), but it is\ndebatable how revisionist his theory can be, without ceasing to be a\ntheory of depiction. For we want to know how pictures,\nincluding digital photographs, represent. It is possible to\nclaim, in reply, that depiction is not the unitary phenomenon we\nna\u00efvely imagine it to be. But this cannot be established merely\nby showing that Goodman\u2019s theory of symbols precludes a unitary\nexplanation of depiction.\n\nThe principal ground on which philosophers have contested (2) is that\nit is inconsistent with the so-called natural generativity of\npictures. The argument is originally due to Flint Schier (1986:\n43\u201355), but it is also advanced by Richard Wollheim:\n\n\nif I can recognize a picture of a cat, and I know what a dog looks\nlike, then I can be expected to recognize a picture of a dog. But on\n[Goodman\u2019s] view this ought to be baffling. It should be as\nbaffling as if, knowing that the French word \u201cchat\u201d means\na cat, and knowing what dogs look like, I should, on hearing it, be\nable to understand what the word \u201cchien\u201d means. (1987:\n77)\n\n\nHowever, there appear to be conventional symbol systems, such as\nguitar tablature, in which natural generativity occurs. Hence, it is\narguable that Schier and Wollheim mistook a disanalogy between\npictures and words for a disanalogy between pictures and conventional\nsigns in general.\n\n(3) invites two questions. First, what explains the fact that a\npicture has a particular denotation, e.g., that Goya\u2019s portrait\ndenotes the Duke of Wellington? Second, denotation is a\nrelation\u2014the relation between a name and its bearer, or between\na predicate and the members of its extension. So Goodman\u2019s\ntheory also faces the question raised earlier about resemblance\ntheories of depiction, regarding pictures of fictional individuals\n(Zeus, Pegasus), and genre pictures. If the relata of a relation must\nbe existing particulars, then it appears that pictures of these kinds\ncannot denote what they depict. So how do they depict them?\n\nRegarding the first question, Wittgenstein claims that \u201cAn\nobvious, and correct, answer to the question \u2018What makes a\nportrait the portrait of so-and-so?\u2019 is that it is the\nintention\u201d (1958: 32). But Goodman disagrees. He acknowledges\nthat intentions are \u201cusually involved\u201d in setting up\nsymbol systems, as they are in building bridges, \u201cbut in both\ncases, we can study the results independently of the thoughts of the\nmakers\u201d (1972: 125). He claims that what a painting or drawing\ndenotes pictorially depends solely on the arrangement of colours on\nits surface, and the semantic and syntactic conventions that define\nthe symbol system to which it belongs (1968: 42). But it seems to\nfollow that few portraits, if any, portray a single individual, as\nopposed to every member of a class of similar individuals. For if\npictures are effectively predicate-like symbols in a pictorial system,\nthen unless X is the sole individual satisfying a portrait,\ni.e., unless the portrait is a uniquely identifying pictorial\n\u201cdescription\u201d of X, X is not the only\nsubject of the portrait, the sole individual it portrays. Furthermore,\nit is hard to see how one can paint an inaccurate portrait of someone,\njust as it is hard to see how one can use an inaccurate description to\nrefer to someone (e.g., \u201cThe man drinking a martini is\nmy brother\u201d, when he is actually drinking a daiquiri), if whom\none refers to depends purely on the syntax and semantics of the phrase\n(Kripke 1977).\n\nRegarding the second question, concerning pictures of fictional\nindividuals and genre pictures, Goodman argues that the verbs\n\u201cdepict\u201d and \u201crepresent\u201d are \u201chighly\nambiguous\u201d (1968: 22). In the sentence \u201cGoya\u2019s\nportrait represents the Duke of Wellington\u201d,\n\u201crepresents\u201d is a two-place predicate, expressing a\nrelation, and the sentence as a whole identifies the denotation of\nGoya\u2019s portrait; whereas in the sentence \u201cRubens\u2019\npainting represents Pegasus\u201d, \u201crepresents\u201d is part\nof a one-place predicate, and the sentence as a whole classifies or\ncharacterizes Rubens\u2019 painting without implying that it denotes\nanything at all. Thus, pictures with null denotation are comparable to\npredicates or descriptions with null denotation, such as \u201cflying\nhorse\u201d or \u201clargest prime number\u201d. We can distinguish\nbetween a picture of a centaur and a picture of a unicorn, even though\nthey denote exactly the same objects (i.e., none), because they are\ninstances of different characters in a symbol system that we\nunderstand. The symbol system consists of rules \u201ccorrelating\nsymbols with denotata\u201d (1968: 228), but it provides for pictures\nwith null denotation.\n\nFinally, according to Goodman, a pictorial symbol system consists of\nrules correlating symbols with denotata, but he does not propose a\nsingle example of such a rule. He refers to \u201cthe traditional\nWestern system of representation\u201d (1968: 226), but he does not\nbegin to formulate its rules. It is uncontroversial that various kinds\nof customs, rules and conventions are involved in making pictures,\nincluding technical procedures, iconographic conventions, rules of\ncomposition, and so on. But none of these have the function of\ncorrelating symbols with denotata, and it is doubtful whether\npictorial rules of this specific kind exist (Hyman 2006:\n174\u2013175).\n\nDespite these objections to Goodman\u2019s theory of depiction, it\ncontinues to exert an influence on philosophers of art. For example,\nJohn Kulvicki has recently defended a theory that is designed to\naddress some of the arguments above, and to incorporate some of the\nideas advanced by Goodman\u2019s opponents, while retaining\nGoodman\u2019s principal ideas. In particular, Kulvicki agrees with\nGoodman that a picture is a symbol in a denotative system, and that a\ndenotative system is pictorial in virtue of its structure, rather than\nany resemblance between its symbols and the objects they denote\n(Kulvicki 2006: 13). But it is difficult to be certain how far he\nshares Goodman\u2019s approach to the semantics of pictures, and of\nsymbols generally. In particular, Kulvicki relies on the idea that\npictures have different kinds of content (see below), but it\nis unclear whether he agrees with Goodman\u2019s reduction of content\nto denotation (1968: 27\u201329), and whether he shares\nGoodman\u2019s general commitment to extensionalism (see \n\u00a73.1 of the entry on\n Nelson Goodman),\n or whether he agrees with Frege that as well as having a reference or\ndenotation, names and descriptions also express a sense.\n\nAccording to Kulvicki, the semantic features of a picture are the\n\u201cfeatures the picture depicts its scene as having\u201d, while\nits syntactic features are the colour and shape properties that are\n\u201crelevant to the semantics of the picture\u201d (2014:\n92\u201393). Not all of a picture\u2019s colour and shape properties\nqualify as syntactic features. For example, the brownish colour of a\nsepia photograph is merely an \u201cincidental\u201d feature.\nKulvicki argues that a pictorial symbol system has four\ncharacteristics: (a) repleteness, i.e., a relatively wide\nrange of properties of a picture qualify as syntactic features, e.g.,\ncolour, thickness of lines, etc.; (b) sensitivity, i.e.,\nsmall changes to a picture in respect of any of these properties are\nsyntactically significant (cf. Bach 1970: 128\u2013132); (c)\nrichness, i.e., \u201cthere are at least as many possible\ndenotations in the system as there are syntactic types\u201d\n(Kulvicki 2006: 38); (d) transparency, i.e., if part of a\npicture X depicts a picture Y, then that part of\nX has the syntactic features that Y is depicted as\nhaving.\n\nRepleteness, sensitivity and richness are\nexplained, and compared with Goodman\u2019s relative repleteness,\nsyntactic density and semantic density, in Kulvicki 2006\n(29\u201346). But Kulvicki explores transparency in most detail,\ndeducing in particular the following consequence: that a picture\nresembles the scene it represents in respect of a limited\nrange of colour and shape properties, such as \u201cthe abstract\npattern of light and dark\u201d recorded by a black-and-white\nphotograph (2014: 101). Kulvicki calls this range of properties the\npicture\u2019s \u201cbare bones content\u201d, following Haugeland\n1991. He does not attempt to define the colour- and shape-properties\nit consists in, but like Hyman, he suggests that the resemblance he\npostulates between a picture and the scene it represents partially\nexplains how the normal experience of perceiving what a picture\nrepresents occurs. A picture\u2019s \u201cfleshed out content\u201d\n(i.e., the content identified in a normal description of a picture: a\nhorse, a man, etc.) depends on its propensity to trigger a\nspectator\u2019s ability to recognize kinds of objects by the shape-\nand colour-properties included in its bare bones content:\n\n\nSeeing a fleshed out content results from deploying concepts as a\nresult of seeing the picture surface\u2014and thus registering its\nbare bones content\u2014that do not apply to the picture surface.\nWhich concepts we deploy depends on what recognitionally keyed\nconcepts we have, which determines the perceptual salience of a given\nfleshed out content. (2006: 173\u2013174)\n\n\nThe main questions critics have raised about Kulvicki\u2019s theory\nare as follows. First, it is designed to avoid some of the objections\nto Goodman\u2019s theory, notably the fact that there are digital\npictures as well as analog ones, but other objections remain,\nespecially those concerning Goodman\u2019s doctrine that denotation\nis \u201cthe core of representation\u201d. Second, it is unclear\nwhat role Kulvicki accords to the artist\u2019s intention in the\ntheory of depiction. The question is ignored in Kulvicki 2006, as it\nis in Goodman 1968. In Kulvicki 2014, by contrast, he suggests that\npictures \u201crepresent in virtue of the intentions of their\nmakers\u201d (2014: 156), but he does not discuss the scope of this\nprinciple (e.g., whether it applies to the sense or reference of a\npicture, or to both) or how precisely the role of intention should be\ndefined. Finally, Kulvicki\u2019s explicit disagreement with Goodman\nfocuses on how the relationships between the symbols in a pictorial\nsystem should be defined. But it is debatable whether the four\nconditions he stipulates are in fact necessary and sufficient for\ndepiction. Some alleged counter-examples are discussed in Blumson\n2011, Newall 2011, and Kulvicki 2012.\n",
