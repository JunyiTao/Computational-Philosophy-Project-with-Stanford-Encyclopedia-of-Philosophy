However, although it\nclearly has roots in Leopold\u2019s thought, the explicit idea of\necological aesthetics, or as it is sometimes called, ecoaesthetics,\nseems to have later origins (Meeker 1872, Koh 1988). Moreover,\nalthough the idea has had for some time a place within analytic\nenvironmental aesthetics, perhaps best filled by scientific\ncognitivism, more recently it has also been adopted by some\nphilosophers working in the \u201ccontinental tradition\u201d. For\nexample, it is claimed that although phenomenological work in\n\u201cecological aesthetics\u201d is \u201cstill in its\ninfancy\u201d, the work of Husserl, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty is\napplicable to its development. Moreover, it is suggested that the\naesthetics of engagement is the first and currently the strongest\n\u201ccomprehensive phenomenological theory of ecological\naesthetics\u201d and that it in combination with scientific\ncognitivism would constitute a stronger ecological aesthetics\n(Toadvine 2010). There is also other recent research in environmental\naesthetics that draws, more or less, on both analytic and continental\ntraditions (Tafalla 2011, Leddy 2012b, Maskit 2014, Paetzold 2014,\nSeel 2015, J\u00f3hannesd\u00f3ttir 2016).\n\nThere is, in addition, considerable interest in environmental\naesthetics in the East, which likewise draws on both analytic and\ncontinental traditions as well as on Eastern philosophy (Cheng 2010\n2013b 2017b, Yuedi 2014, Chen 2015). Several different topics\nconcerning both natural and human environments are addressed in the\nrecent work in this area, which includes research not only by Eastern\nbut also by Western scholars (Xue 2008 2018, Xue and Carlson 2010,\nSaito 2014a, Aota 2016, Berleant 2013a 2016, Carlson 2017, Odin 2017,\nZeng Y. 2017, Brubaker 2018, Chung 2018, Parsons and Zhang 2018).\nThere are also some collections that contain relevant essays (Cheng\net al 2013, Yuedi and Carter 2014a, Callicott and McRae 2017,\nNguyen 2018) as well as some journal issues devoted especially to\nrecent work in Eastern aesthetics, for example, Critical\nTheory, 1, 2 (2017) and Contemporary Aesthetics, Special\nVolume 6 (2018). Within this body of work, perhaps the most dominate\narea of interest is ecological aesthetics, which is pursued by several\nChinese aestheticians, who have developed robust versions of\necoaesthetics (Cheng 2013a 2016, Zeng F. 2017). Other than the sources\ncited here, much of this work is available only in Chinese. However,\none prominent version of ecoaesthetics, which is accessible in\nEnglish, embraces, as the \u201cfour keystones of ecological\naesthetic appreciation\u201d, not only the centrality of ecological\nknowledge and the rejection of the duality of humanity and the natural\nworld, but also the over-arching value of ecosystem biodiversity and\nhealth and the continued guidance of ecological ethics (Cheng 2013c).\nWhile the first two of these four \u201ckeystones\u201d reflect\nscientific cognitivism and the aesthetics of engagement, the last two\ngo well beyond these Western positions. By placing ecosystem health\nand ecological ethics within the framework of ecoaesthetics, Chinese\necological aesthetics directly and powerfully addresses the question\nof the relationship between environmental aesthetics and environmental\nethics (Carlson 2018). This move is comparable to, and perhaps more\nsuccessful than, the attempts by Western aestheticians to bring\naesthetic appreciation of both natural and human environments in line\nwith moral obligations to maintain environmental and ecological health\n(Rolston 1995, Eaton 1997 1998, Lintott 2006, Saito 2007 2008,\nVarandas 2015) and to forge strong positive links between aesthetic\nappreciation of nature and nature protection and preservation (Rolston\n2002, Brady 2003, Carlson and Lintott 2007, Parsons 2008a, Carlson\n2010, Lintott and Carlson 2014, Parsons 2018). Nonetheless, the degree\nto which aesthetic appreciation of both natural and human environments\nand ethical considerations are related to one another continues to be\na matter of investigation, discussion, and debate (Loftis 2003, Bannon\n2011, Stecker 2012, Carlson 2018, Stewart and Johnson 2018).\n\nThe current research in environmental aesthetics that draws on the\ncontinental tradition and the extensive work on ecoaesthetics by\nEastern scholars are examples of the globalization of environmental\naesthetics. Recently there have been calls in both the East and the\nWest for the globalization of aesthetics in general (Li and Cauvel\n2006, Higgins 2017) and of environmental aesthetics in particular\n(Saito 2010, Yuedi and Carter 2014b). Such calls are vital to the\ncontinuing growth of the field, yet it is also important to note that,\nalthough work on ecoaesthetics within the continental tradition and\nits development in the East are relatively recent, environmental\naesthetics itself has long had a global orientation. Since its\ninception, there has been interest in the field by a wide range of\nscholars exploring different philosophical traditions and/or working\nin different countries. For example, drawing on continental philosophy\nis not new to environmental aesthetics (Berleant 1985). Likewise,\nthere was significant research on Japanese aesthetics of nature early\nin the development of environmental aesthetics (Saito 1985 1992 1996)\nwhich has continued into the present century (Saito 2002 2014a).\nAnother example is the research produced in Finland, where a number of\nconferences were hosted during the 1990s and 2000s, each followed by a\ncollection of articles, such as (Sep\u00e4nmaa and Heikkil\u00e4-Palo\n2005, Sep\u00e4nmaa et al 2007). Similarly, several\nconferences have been held in China in recent years, to which Western\nscholars have been invited and from which have followed collections of\narticles (Cheng et al 2013, Yuedi and Carter 2014a). Similar\ncollections have also published papers presented at conferences in\nEurope (Drenthen and Keulartz 2014) and in North America, from which\npapers are included in a recent special issue of the Journal of\nAesthetics and Art Criticism (Shapshay and Tenen 2018a). Another\nindication of the global appeal of environmental aesthetics is that\nmany articles and books in environmental aesthetics have been\ntranslated from English into a number of other languages, including\nseveral European languages as well as Korean and especially Chinese,\ninto which several of the basic Western texts in environmental\naesthetics have been translated. Moreover, this global appeal is\nfurther evidenced by the prolific research in the field currently\nbeing published in several different countries and languages. \n\nThe continuing globalization of environmental aesthetics as well as\nthe currently fruitful discussions both within and among the various\npoints of view represented in contemporary research, such as in\necoaesthetics, suggests that the work that is most productive for\npromoting and supporting the aesthetic appreciation and preservation\nof all kinds of environments, both natural and human, is that which\ndepends not simply on any one particular approach to environmental\naesthetics, but rather on attempts to bring together the resources of\nseveral different orientations and traditions (Nassauer 1997, Lintott\n2006, Carlson 2009, Moore 2008, Cheng et al 2013, Carlson\n2018). For example, in addition to the Chinese research in\necoaesthetics, there are, as noted, similar efforts by Western\nscholars to combine elements of cognitive and non-cognitive points of\nview (Rolston 1998 2002, Saito 2007, Toadvine 2010). Moreover, many\nthinkers explore other topics that they constructively relate to\nenvironmental aesthetics, for instance, feminist theory (Lee 2006,\nLintott 2010, Lintott and Irvin 2016), political and social issues\n(Berleant 2005 2012, Ross 2005, Simus 2008b, McShane 2018, Saito\n2018), philosophy of biology (Parsons and Carlson 2008), animal\ntreatment and protection (Parsons 2007, Hettinger 2010, Semczyszyn\n2013, Brady 2014a, Tafalla 2017, Cross 2018), weather and climate\nchange (Brady 2014b, Diaconu 2015, Nomikos 2018), and, perhaps most\nimportant, the enrichment of the quality of human life (Saito 2017a\n2018, Jamieson 2018). This kind of work can also pursue the\napplication of these and related topics to environmental policy and\npractice (Saito 2007, Berleant 2010b 2012, Parsons 2010, Sep\u00e4nmaa\n2010, Robinson and Elliott 2011, Cheng et al 2013, Brady\n2014b). In this way, these contributions continue to shape the future\ndirections of environmental aesthetics (Saito 2010 2014b, Blanc 2012,\nDrenthen and Keulartz 2014, Shapshay and Tenen 2018b). Such\ninnovative, eclectic approaches, coupled with the globalization of\nenvironmental aesthetics, will hopefully not only further a wide range\nof environmental goals and practices but also foster a deeper\nunderstanding and appreciation of the aesthetic potential of the world\nin which we live.\n",
