    "main_text": "Governance || Institutional vs. Character-Centered Theories of Governance\n7. Influence\n\nThe Confucian thinkers of the Song-Ming period came in for a great\ndeal of criticism in the centuries following the collapse of the Ming\ndynasty in 1644. Much of the innovative scholarship in the subsequent\nQing dynasty (1644\u20131911) was conducted by Confucian scholars\nclosely affiliated with \u201cevidential studies\u201d, who tended\nto see philosophers like Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming as too reliant on\nabstract speculation and personal introspection. As Chinese\nintellectuals began to take more interest in Western philosophy in the\n19th and 20th centuries, some saw themselves as\nbelonging to a tradition continuous with philosophers like Zhu and\nWang, but others rejected Confucianism outright and Song-Ming\nConfucianism with it. Still, Zhu Xi stayed squarely at the center of\nthe formal education system and the civil service exams right up to\nthe early 20th century. And there is little question that\nSong-Ming Confucianism\u2014especially the works of Zhu and\nWang\u2014continue to be tremendously influential in the late\n20th and early 21st centuries. To this day, many\npeople in East Asia who take a more scholarly approach to Confucianism\nregard Zhu\u2019s interpretations as authoritative. Standard\nChinese-language \u201creaders\u201d (duben\n\u8b80\u672c) of the Confucian canon follow Zhu Xi\u2019s\ninterpretations closely (e.g., Xie 2003). Consequently, some of the\npopular treatments of classical Confucianism continue to adopt the\nterminology, conceptual frameworks, and philosophical vision of Zhu Xi\neven as they purport to provide interpretations of the\ntradition\u2019s founding figures and texts. In the West it is not\nuncommon to find specialists in Confucian philosophy who work\nprimarily or exclusively on classical texts such as the\nAnalects or the Mencius, but for scholars of\nConfucianism in Chinese-speaking countries, many of the philosophical\ndisputes are extensions of those found in the Song and Ming. The\nChinese-speaking world\u2019s most celebrated present-day\nphilosophers are \u201cNew Confucians\u201d (Xin\nrujia \u65b0\u5112\u5bb6), thinkers that take\nthemselves to be continuing the work of the Song-Ming Confucians (M.\nLee 2017; Makeham 2003a). The same is true for scholars of\nConfucianism throughout East Asia, due in part to the tremendous\ninfluence of Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming in Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. A\ngreat deal of current Confucian discourse in East Asia is framed as a\nmatter of taking sides between competing lineages or factions of the\nSong and Ming, especially the Learning of Pattern (Lixue)\nschool associated with Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi and the Learning of the\nHeartmind (Xinxue) school associated with Lu Xiangshan and\nWang Yangming (Chen 2010).\n\nIn certain respects it is unsurprising that Song-Ming Confucianism has\nloomed so large in East Asian philosophy in the present day. The\nthinkers of the Song-Ming period did so much to add philosophical\ndepth and systematicity to the more laconic and fragmentary Confucian\ncanon, it thus understandable that the scholars who are themselves\nphilosophers or looking for philosophy in the historical Confucian\ntradition would be drawn to its greatest systematizers.\n",
