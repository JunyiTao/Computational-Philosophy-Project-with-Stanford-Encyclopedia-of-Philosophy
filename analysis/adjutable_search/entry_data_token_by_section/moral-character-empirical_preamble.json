    "main_text": "\n\nThe turn of the century saw a significant increase in the amount of\nattention being paid by philosophers to empirical issues about moral\ncharacter. Dating back at least to Plato and Aristotle in the West,\nand Confucius in the East, philosophers have traditionally drawn on\nempirical data to some extent in their theorizing about character. One\nof the main differences in recent years has been the source of this\nempirical data, namely the work of social and personality\npsychologists on morally relevant thought and action.\n\nThis entry briefly examines four recent empirical approaches to moral\ncharacter. It will draw on the psychology literature where\nappropriate, but the main focus will be on the significance of that\nwork for philosophers interested in better understanding moral\ncharacter. The four areas are situationism, the CAPS model, the Big\nFive model, and the VIA. The remainder of this entry devotes a section\nto each of them.\n",
