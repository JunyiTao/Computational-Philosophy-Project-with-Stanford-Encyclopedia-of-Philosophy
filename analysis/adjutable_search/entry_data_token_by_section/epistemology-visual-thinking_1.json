    "main_text": "Historical Background\n2. Historical Background\n\u201cMathematics can achieve nothing by concepts alone but\nhastens at once to intuition\u201d wrote Kant (1781/9: A715/B743),\nbefore describing the geometrical construction in Euclid\u2019s proof\nof the angle sum theorem (Euclid, Book 1, proposition 32). In a review\nof 1816 Gauss echoes Kant:\n\n\nanybody who is acquainted with the essence of geometry knows that [the\nlogical principles of identity and contradiction] are able to\naccomplish nothing by themselves, and that they put forth sterile\nblossoms unless the fertile living intuition of the object itself\nprevails everywhere.  (Ewald 1996 [Vol. 1]: 300)\n\n\nThe word \u201cintuition\u201d here translates the German\n\u201cAnschauung\u201d, a word which applies to visual\nimagination and perception, though it also has more general uses.\nBy the late 19th century a different view had emerged,\nat least in foundational areas. In a celebrated text giving the first\nrigorous axiomatization of projective geometry, Pasch wrote:\n\u201cthe theorem is only truly demonstrated if the proof is\ncompletely independent of the figure\u201d (Pasch 1882), a view\nexpressed also by Hilbert in writing on the foundations of geometry\n(Hilbert 1894). A negative attitude to visual thinking was not\nconfined to geometry.  Dedekind, for example, wrote of an overpowering\nfeeling of dissatisfaction with appeal to geometric intuitions in\nbasic infinitesimal analysis (Dedekind 1872, Introduction). The\ngrounds were felt to be uncertain, the concepts employed vague and\nunclear. When such concepts were replaced by precisely defined\nalternatives without allusions to space, time or motion, our intuitive\nexpectations turned out to be unreliable (Hahn 1933).\nIn some quarters this view turned into a general disdain for visual\nthinking in mathematics: \u201cIn the best books\u201d Russell\npronounced \u201cthere are no figures at all\u201d (Russell 1901).\nAlthough this attitude was opposed by a few mathematicians, notably\nKlein (1893), others took it to heart. Landau, for example, wrote a\ncalculus textbook without a single diagram (Landau 1934). But the\npredominant view was not so extreme: thinking in terms of figures was\nvalued as a means of facilitating grasp of formulae and linguistic\ntext, but only reasoning expressed by means of formulae and text could\nbear any epistemological weight.\nBy the late 20th century the mood had swung back in\nfavour of visualization: Mancosu (2005) provides an excellent survey.\nSome books advertise their defiance of anti-visual puritanism in their\ntitles, for example Visual Geometry and Topology (Fomenko\n1994) and Visual Complex Analysis (Needham 1997); mathematics\neducators turn their attention to pedagogical uses of visualization\n(Zimmerman and Cunningham 1991); the use of computer-generated imagery\nbegins to bear fruit at research level (Hoffman 1987; Palais 1999),\nand diagrams find their way into research papers in abstract fields:\nsee for example the papers on higher dimensional category theory by\nJoyal et al. (1996), Leinster (2004) and Lauda (2005, Other Internet\nResources). But attitudes\nto the epistemology of visual thinking remain mixed. The discussion is\nmostly concerned with the role of diagrams in proofs.\n",
