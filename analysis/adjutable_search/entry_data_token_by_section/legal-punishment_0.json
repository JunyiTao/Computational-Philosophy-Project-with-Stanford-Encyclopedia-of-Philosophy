    "main_text": "Legal Punishment and Its Justification\n1. Legal Punishment and Its Justification\n\nThe central question asked by philosophers of punishment is: What can\njustify punishment? More precisely, since they do not usually talk\nmuch about punishment in such contexts as the family or the workplace\n(but see Zaibert 2006; Bennett 2008: Part II), their question is this:\nWhat can justify formal, legal punishment imposed by the state on\nthose convicted of committing criminal offences? We will also focus on\nlegal punishment here: not because the other species of punishment do\nnot raise important normative questions (they do), nor because such\nquestions can be answered in terms of an initial justification of\nlegal punishment as being the paradigm case (since it\u2019s not\nclear that they can be), but because legal punishment, apart from\nbeing more dramatically coercive and burdensome than other species of\npunishment usually are, raises distinctive issues about the role of\nthe state and its relationship to its citizens, and about the role of\nthe criminal law. Future references to \u2018punishment\u2019 should\ntherefore be read, unless otherwise specified, as references to legal\nor criminal punishment.\n\nWhat then are we to justify in justifying punishment? The search for a\nprecise definition of punishment that exercised some philosophers (for\ndiscussion and references, see Scheid 1980; Boonin 2008: 3\u201328;\nZimmerman 2011: ch. 1) is likely to prove futile; but we can say that\nlegal punishment involves the imposition of something that is intended\nto be both burdensome and reprobative, on a supposed offender for a\nsupposed crime, by a person or body who claims the authority to do so.\nTwo points are worth particular notice here.\n\nFirst, punishment involves material impositions or exactions that are\nin themselves typically unwelcome: they deprive people of things that\nthey value (liberty, money, time); they require people to do things\nthat they would not normally want to do or do voluntarily (to spend\ntime on unpaid community labour, to report to a probation officer\nregularly, to undertake demanding programmes of various kinds). What\ndistinguishes punishment from other kinds of coercive imposition, such\nas taxation, is that punishment is precisely intended to\n\u2026: but to what? Some would say that punishment is intended to\ninflict pain or suffering: but that suggests that what matters is pain\nor suffering as such (and invites the familiar criticism that we and\nthe state should not be in the business of trying to inflict pain or\nsuffering on people; see Christie 1981 on\n\u2018pain-delivery\u2019), which some penal theorists would reject\nas a distortion. Others would say that punishment is intended to cause\nharm to the offender \u2014 adding, if they are careful (see Hanna\n2014: s. 2) that what is intended is \u2018prima facie harm\u2019\nrather than \u2018all-things-considered harm\u2019, to allow for the\npossibility that punishment might be, or might be intended to be, on\nbalance beneficial to the offender. But some theorists would deny even\nthis, since they would deny that punishment must be intended to be\n\u2018intrinsically bad\u2019 for the person punished. It is safer\nto say that punishment must be intended to be burdensome, and that is\nhow punishment will be understood in what follows. (For running debate\nabout this intentionality feature, see Wringe 2013, Hanna 2017, Wringe\n2019, Hanna 2020.)\n\nSecond, it is widely accepted that what distinguishes punishment from\nmere \u2018penalties\u2019 (see Feinberg 1970) is their reprobative\nor condemnatory character. Penalties, such as parking tickets, might\nbe imposed to deter the penalised conduct (or to recoup some of the\ncosts that it causes) without being intended to express societal\ncondemnation. But even if a primary purpose of punishment is\ndeterrence (see ss. 3\u20134 below), its imposition (the conviction\nand formal sentence that the offender receives in court, the\nadministration of the punishment itself) also expresses the censure or\ncondemnation that the offender\u2019s crime is taken to warrant.\n\nThese two features, that punishment is intentionally burdensome and\ncondemnatory, make the practice especially normatively challenging.\nHow can a practice that not only burdens those subjected to it but\naims to burden them, and which conveys society\u2019s condemnation,\nbe justified?\n\nWe should not assume, however, that there is only one question of\njustification, which can receive just one answer. As Hart famously\npointed out (Hart 1968: 1\u201327), we must distinguish at least\nthree justificatory issues. First, what compelling reason is there to\ncreate and maintain a system of punishment: what good can it achieve,\nwhat duty can it fulfil, what moral demand can it satisfy? (Hart\ntermed this the question of punishment's \u2018general justifying\naim\u2019, although the term may be misleading in that talk of\n\u2018aims\u2019 may seem to privilege a consequentialist answer to\nthe question, whereas the compelling reason could be a\nnonconsequentialist one.) Second, who may properly be punished: what\nprinciples or aims should determine the allocations of punishments to\nindividuals? Third, how should the appropriate amount of punishment be\ndetermined: how should sentencers go about deciding what sentence to\nimpose? (One dimension of this third question concerns the amount or\nseverity of punishment; another, which is insufficiently discussed by\nphilosophers, concerns the concrete modes of punishment that should be\navailable, in general or for particular crimes.) It might of course\nturn out that answers to all these questions will flow from a single\ntheoretical foundation \u2014 for instance, from a unitary\nconsequentialist principle specifying the good that punishment should\nachieve, or from some version of the retributivist principle that the\nsole proper aim of punishment is to impose on the guilty the punitive\nburdens they deserve. But matters might not be as simple as that: we\nmight find that quite different and conflicting values are relevant to\ndifferent issues about punishment, and that any complete normative\naccount of punishment will have to find a place for these values and\noffer guidance in how to resolve tensions among them when they\nconflict (see s. 6).\n\nEven this way of putting the matter oversimplifies it, by implying\nthat we can hope to find a \u2018complete normative account of\npunishment\u2019: an account, that is, of how punishment can be\njustified. It is certainly an implicit assumption of much\nphilosophical and legal discussion that punishment can, of course, be\njustified, and that the theorists\u2019 task is to establish and\nexplicate that justification. But it is an illegitimate assumption:\nnormative theorists must be open to the possibility, startling and\ndisturbing as it might be, that this pervasive human practice cannot\nbe justified. Nor is this merely the kind of fantastical scepticism\nthat moral philosophers are sometimes prone to imagine (\u2018suppose\nsomeone denied that killing for pleasure was wrong\u2019): there is a\nsignificant strand of \u2018abolitionist\u2019 penal theorising (the\nsubject of increasing philosophical attention in recent years) that\nargues precisely that legal punishment cannot be justified and should\nbe abolished.\n\nWe will attend to some abolitionist arguments in section 7. Even if\nthose arguments can be met, even if legal punishment can be justified,\nat least in principle, the abolitionist challenge is one that must be\nmet, rather than ignored; and it will help to remind us of the ways in\nwhich any practice of legal punishment is bound to be morally\nproblematic.\n",
