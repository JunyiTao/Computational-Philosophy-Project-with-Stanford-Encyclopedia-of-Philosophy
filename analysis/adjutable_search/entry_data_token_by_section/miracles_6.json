    "main_text": "Arguments for Miracle Claims || Four types of arguments\n2.2 Four types of arguments\n\n\nIn addition to this classification of the aims of an argument, there\nis a more common distinction among arguments in terms of their\nstructure. Broadly speaking, most arguments for miracle claims fall\ninto one of four structural categories: deductive, criteriological,\nexplanatory, or probabilistic. A valid deductive argument is one in\nwhich, given the truth of the premises, the conclusion must also be\ntrue. A criteriological argument sets forth some criteria ostensibly\nmet by the claim in question and concludes that the satisfaction of\nthose criteria reflects well on the claim\u2014that it is certain, or\ntrue, or likely to be true, or plausible, or more plausible than it\nwould have been had it not met the criteria. An explanatory argument is\ntypically contrastive: it aims to show, for example, that one\nhypothesis is a better explanation of a certain body of facts than any\nrival hypothesis or than the disjunction of all rival hypotheses. A\nprobabilistic argument aims to show that the conclusion is more\nprobable than not, or that it is more probable than some fixed standard\n(say, 0.99), or that it is far more probable given the evidence adduced\nthan it is considered independent of that evidence.\n\n\nThe latter three categories are not mutually exclusive. An argument\nmay be put forward as criteriological but be best analyzed, on\nreflection, as explanatory; an explanatory argument may be best\nanalyzed in probabilistic terms. But the fourfold classification will\ndo for a first rough sorting.\n2.2.1 Deductive arguments\n\n\nDeductive arguments for miracle claims are relatively rare in\nserious modern discussions, since they are subject to peculiar\nliabilities. Here, for example, is a deductive reconstruction of an\nargument given by William Paley (1859), broadly modeled on the version\ngiven by Richard Whately (1870: 254\u2013258) and other Victorian\nlogicians:\n\nAll miracles attested by persons, claiming to have witnessed\nthem, who pass their lives in labors, dangers, and sufferings in\nsupport of their statements, and who, in consequence of their belief,\nsubmit to new rules of conduct, are worthy of credit.\nThe central Christian miracles are attested by such evidence.\n\n\nTherefore,\n\nThe central Christian miracles are worthy of credit.\n\n\n\nThere are several strategies available for pressing a critique of\nthis argument. In ancient times, premise 2 was generally conceded,\nwhile premise 1 was contested; since the Enlightenment, it has become\nsomewhat more common for critics to contest premise 2 as well. There\nare also indirect approaches that exploit the deductive structure of\nthe argument to argue that something must be wrong with the argument\nwithout getting bogged down in the details of a specific critique.\nAdding further true premises does not reduce the support that a\ndeductive argument gives to its conclusion; but the addition of such\npremises may bring to light some awkward consequences. One\ninterpretation of one part of Hume\u2019s strategy in \u201cOf\nMiracles,\u201d part 2 is that he has in mind the addition of a\nfurther premise:\n\n\n2*. Various non-Christian miracles are attested by such (or better)\nevidence,\n\n\nthe conclusion envisaged being, of course, that\n\n\n3*. Various non-Christian miracles are worthy of credit.\n\n\nThe strategy is intended as a reductio ad absurdum of the\nfirst premise, since prima facie it is not the case that both\nthe Christian miracles and the non-Christian miracles are worthy of\ncredit. Paley does not cast his own argument into a deductive form, but\nhe does attempt to forestall this sort of criticism by adding, in rounding\nout Part 1, an additional claim for which he offers several lines of\nargument:\n[T]here is not satisfactory evidence, that persons\nprofessing to be original witnesses of other miracles, in their nature\nas certain as these are, have ever acted in the same manner, in\nattestation of the accounts which they delivered, and properly in\nconsequence of their belief of those accounts. (Paley 1859: 181)\n\n2.2.2 Criteriological arguments\n\n\nA classic formulation of a criteriological argument for miracles is\nemployed by Charles Leslie (1697/1815: 13), who argues that we may safely\nbelieve an historical claim that meets four criteria:\n\nThat the matters of fact be such, as that men\u2019s outward\nsenses, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it.\nThat it be done publicly in the face of the world.\nThat not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but\nsome outward actions to be performed.\nThat such monuments, and such actions or observances, be\ninstituted, and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was\ndone.\n\n\n\nThe first two criteria, Leslie explains, \u201cmake it impossible\nfor any such matter of fact to be imposed upon men, at the time when\nsuch fact was said to be done, because every man\u2019s eyes and\nsenses would contradict it.\u201d The latter two criteria assure those\nwho come afterwards that the account of the event was not invented\nsubsequent to the time of the purported event. Leslie points out that\nthese criteria are not necessary conditions of factual truth, but he\ninsists that they are\u2014taken jointly\u2014sufficient. Hence we\nmay speak of Leslie\u2019s principle: If any reported event meets all\nfour of these criteria, then its historicity is certain.\n\n\nIn assessing a criteriological argument, we need to ask not only\nwhether the event in question meets the criteria but also whether the\ncriteria themselves are good indicators of truth. An argument for the\ncriteria that Leslie gives cannot proceed wholly a priori,\nsince there is not a necessary connection between an event\u2019s\nsatisfying the criteria and its being true. In this case, perhaps the\nmost promising approach would be to argue that the criteria effectively\nrule out explanations other than the truth of the claim. Leslie\u2019s\nremarks suggest that this is the direction he would go if challenged,\nbut he does not offer a fully developed defense of his criteria.\n\n\nLeslie\u2019s argument is, in the sense outlined above,\ncategorical\u2014he holds that, as the claim of the resurrection meets\nall four criteria (the memorials being supplied by the Christian\ncommemoration of the last supper and the transfer of the day of worship\nfrom the Sabbath (Saturday) to the first day of the week (Sunday)), the\ncertainty of the matter of fact in question is\n\u201cdemonstrated.\u201d This rather bold claim opens the\npossibility of refutation of Leslie\u2019s principle by\ncounterexample, though reportedly Conyers Middleton, a contemporary of\nHume whose critique of the ecclesiastical miracles was notable for its\nthoroughness, searched vainly for years for a counterexample to\nLeslie\u2019s principle. Be that as it may, a criteriological argument\nmay also be constructed on the basis of a more modest principle, such\nas that if any reported event meets all four of these criteria, then it\nis reasonable to accept its historicity.\n\n\nThe chief difficulty with criteriological arguments, whether bold or\nmodest, is that they provide no means for taking into account any other\nconsiderations that might weigh against the historical claim in\nquestion. Intuitively, extreme antecedent improbability ought to carry\nsome weight in our evaluation of the credibility of a factual claim. A\ndefender of a criteriological argument might respond that so long as\nthe bar is set high enough, antecedent improbability will be\noverwhelmed by the fact that the event does indeed meet the stipulated\ncriteria. But this is a claim that requires argument; and the bolder\nthe conclusion, the more argument it requires.\n2.2.3 Explanatory arguments\n\n\nA third approach to arguing for a miracle claim is to argue that it\nis the best explanation for a small set of widely conceded facts. A\ntypical \u201cminimal facts\u201d argument for the resurrection of\nJesus starts with a list of facts such as these (Habermas 1996:\n162):\n\nJesus died by crucifixion.\nHis disciples subsequently had experiences which they believed\nwere literal physical appearances of the risen Jesus.\nThe disciples were transformed from fearful cowards into bold\nproclaimers who were willing to face persecution and death for their\nmessage.\nPaul, who had previously been a persecutor of the Christians, had\nan experience that he also believed was an appearance of the risen\nJesus.\n\n\n\nNone of these four facts is, in itself, a supernatural claim, and\nvirtually all critical scholars with relevant expertise concur in these\nfacts on ordinary historical grounds. The explanatory argument starts\nwith this scholarly consensus and contends that all alternative\nexplanations for these facts are inferior to the explanation that Jesus\nactually did rise from the dead. The conclusion is therefore typically\ncategorical.\n\n\nOne advantage of this approach over the criteriological approach is\nthat the inference is explicitly contrastive: the argument engages\ndirectly with alternative explanations of the data. Such engagement\nbrings with it the burden of examining a variety of alternative\nexplanations, a burden that is sometimes discharged by reference to\nestablished criteria of historical explanation (Craig 2008: 233).\n\n\nThis sort of explanatory argument may be contested in at least five\nways, a number of which have been explored. First, one might try, the\nscholarly consensus notwithstanding, to dispute the facts asserted.\n(Crossan, in Copan 1998) If successful, this strategy would undermine\nthe positive argument. Second, one might grant, if only for the sake of\nthe argument, the prima facie force of the positive argument\nbut attempt to neutralize it by widening the factual basis to include a\nmatching set of facts, equally well attested, for which the\nfalsehood of the resurrection account is the best explanation.\nThird, one might argue that the relative merits of the miraculous and\nnon-miraculous explanations have been improperly assessed and that,\nrightly considered, one or more of the non-miraculous explanations is\nactually preferable as an explanation of the facts in question.\n(L\u00fcdemann, in Copan and Tacelli 2000) Fourth, one might produce a\nnon-miraculous explanation not addressed in the explanatory argument\nand argue that it is superior to the miraculous explanation (Venturini\n1800; cf. O\u2019Collins and Kendall 1996). Fifth, one might contest\nthe implication that an explanation that is superior to its rivals in\npairwise comparisons is actually more reasonable to believe than not.\nIt is not difficult to imagine (or even to find) cases where one\nexplanation is marginally better than any given rival but where the\ndisjunction of the rival explanations is more believable. This final\ncriticism applies only when the explanatory argument is categorical;\nbut in that case, a further argument would be necessary to close off\nthis line of criticism.\n2.2.4 Probabilistic arguments\n\n\nA fourth method of arguing for a miracle claim is to employ the\nmachinery of Bayesian probability and argue that some fact or set of\nfacts renders the conclusion probable (for a categorical argument) or\nsignificantly more probable than it was taken apart from those facts\n(for a confirmatory one). The argument could be cast in categorical\nform using the odds form of Bayes\u2019s Theorem. It is a simple\nconsequence of Bayes\u2019s Theorem that, where \u2018\\(M\\)\u2019 is\nthe claim that a miracle has taken place and \u2018\\(E\\)\u2019\nis some evidence bearing on that claim, and where all of the relevant\nterms are defined,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(M\\mid E)}{P({\\sim}M\\mid E)} = \n \\frac{P(M)}{P({\\sim}M)} \\times \\frac{P(E\\mid M)}{P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)}\n\\]\n\n\n\nVerbally, this says that the posterior odds on \\(M\\) (that is,\nthe ratio of the posterior probability of \\(M\\) to the posterior\nprobability of its negation) equal the product of the prior odds and\nthe Bayes factor. More colloquially, \\(M\\) becomes more\nplausible when we take into account evidence \\(E\\) that is more\nto be expected if \\(M\\) is true than if \\(M\\) is false. A\ncategorical argument of this sort would involve plugging in values\n(either point-valued or interval-valued) for each term in this\nequation and concluding that \\(P(M\\mid E)\n\\gt k\\), where \\(k\\) is some constant with a value\ngreater than or equal to 0.5. The evaluation of such an argument is\nlikely to turn principally on the relative magnitudes of \\(P(M)\\) and\n\\(P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)\\), since in many contexts the\ndisputants will grant that the other two probabilities that appear on\nthe right side of the equation\u2014\\(P({\\sim}M)\\)\nand \\(P(E\\mid M)\\)\u2014are very close to 1. A\nconfirmatory probabilistic argument might proceed from the same\npremises but dispense with the ratio of the priors, focusing on the\nfact that the ratio \\(P(E\\mid M)/P(E\\mid {\\sim}M)\\)\nis top heavy.\n\n\nThe equation may give the impression that what is going on is rather\narcane. In fact, the mathematics is simply a means of making explicit a\ncommon process of reasoning described well by Joseph Butler (1736/1819:\n194):\n\n\n[T]he truth of our religion, like the truth of common matters, is to\nbe judged of by all the evidence taken together. And unless the whole\nseries of things which may be alleged in this argument, and every\nparticular thing in it, can reasonably be supposed to have been by\naccident (for here the stress of the argument for Christianity lies);\nthen is the truth of it proved: in like manner, as if in any common\ncase, numerous events acknowledged, were to be alleged in proof of any\nother event disputed; the truth of the disputed event would be proved,\nnot only if any one of the acknowledged ones did of itself clearly\nimply it but, though no one of them singly did so, if the whole of the\nacknowledged events taken together could not in reason be supposed to\nhave happened, unless the disputed one were true.\n\n\nAllowing for the change in terminology over the centuries,\nButler\u2019s description can be read as a verbal explication of the\ncategorical form of the Bayesian argument. If the facts can be\naccounted for without difficulty on the supposition of \\(M\\) but\nnot, without great implausibility, on the assumption of \\({\\sim}M\\),\nthen they provide significant evidence in favor of \\(M\\). On this\nreading, Butler is tacitly assuming that the prior probability\nof \\(M\\) is not so low as to overcome the cumulative force of the\nevidence in its favor.\n\n\nHistorically, probabilistic arguments for miracles have centered on\nthe credibility of eyewitness testimony to the miraculous. Where\n\\(T_i (M)\\) stands for\n\u201cWitness \\(i\\) testifies that \\(M\\),\u201d we may\nwrite the relevant form of Bayes\u2019s Theorem as\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{P(M\\mid T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots\\amp T_n (M))}{P({\\sim}M\\mid T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots \\amp T_n (M))} = \\\\\n&\\qquad \\frac{P(M)}{P({\\sim}M)} \\times \n \\frac{P(T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots \\amp T_n (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_1 (M) \\amp \\ldots \\amp T_n (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)}\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\n\nIf we assume that these testimonies are independent of each other\nrelative both to \\(M\\) and to \\({\\sim}M\\)\u2014an assumption that should not be\nmade casually (Kruskal 1988)\u2014we can replace the final term on the\nright with the product\n\n\\[\n\\frac{P(T_1 (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_1 (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)} \\times \\ldots \\times \n \\frac{P(T_n (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_n (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nOn the further simplifying assumption that all of the testimonies\nare of equal weight, this product reduces to\n\n\\[\n\\left[\\frac{P(T_1 (M)\\mid M)}{P(T_1 (M)\\mid {\\sim}M)}\\right]^n\n\\]\n\n\n\nIf \\(P(T_1 (M)\\mid M)/P(T_1 (M)\\mid {\\sim}M) \\gt 1\\), it follows at\nonce that the claim, arguably attributable to Hume, that the evidence\nof testimony can never overcome the antecedent presumption against a\nmiracle, is false. As Charles Babbage puts it:\n\n\n[I]f independent witnesses can be found, who speak truth more\nfrequently than falsehood, it is ALWAYS possible to assign\na number of independent witnesses, the improbability of the falsehood\nof whose concurring testimony shall be greater than the improbability\nof the alleged miracle. (Babbage 1837: 202, emphasis original; cf.\nHolder 1998 and Earman 2000)\n\n\n\n\nAhmed (2015) argues that the anti-Humean argument leveled by Babbage\n(1837), Holder (1999), and Earman (2000) requires an assumption of the\nconditional independence of successive testimonies to the putative\nevent, an assumption that is plausibly always violated both\nconditional on the assumption of its truth and conditional on the\nassumption of its falsehood. In the abstract to his article, Ahmed\nsummarizes his point by saying that \u201ceven multiple reports from\nnon-collusive witnesses lack the sort of independence that could make\ntrouble for Hume.\u201d This enthusiastic promise is tempered,\nhowever, by Ahmed\u2019s recognition later in the same article that\nsomething very much like the same critique can be leveled granting\nthat conditional independence fails in both cases, provided that the\nratio of the likelihoods does not converge to 1 too quickly. So in his\nown summary, his arguments \u201cdo not after all realize the\n\u2018everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion\u2019\nthat Hume envisaged\u201d (Ahmed 2015: 1042).\n\n\nThe evaluation of a serious cumulative argument for a particular\nmiracle claim requires the consideration of historical details that go\nbeyond the bounds of philosophy as a discipline (McGrew and McGrew\n2009). But some general points regarding its structure are of\nphilosophical interest. If the argument is categorical, then its\nconclusion is (at least) that, where \u201c\\(E\\)\u201d stands for\nthe sum of the relevant evidence, \\(P(M\\mid E) \\gt 0.5\\). But where\n\u201c\\(G\\)\u201d stands for \u201cGod exists\u201d (where\n\u201cGod\u201d is conceived classically, as an eternal, personal\nbeing of maximal power, knowledge, and goodness who created the\nuniverse), it is generally acknowledged that \\(P(M\\mid G) \\gg\nP(M\\mid {\\sim}G)\\) and that either \\(P(M\\mid {\\sim}G) = 0\\) (if\nmiracles are strictly the prerogative of God) or at least \\(P(M\\mid\n{\\sim}G) \\approx 0\\). The evaluation of the claim that a miracle has\noccurred will therefore be sensitive to the probability of the claim\nthat God exists, and the evaluation of the categorical form of the\nargument will therefore depend on the overall evaluation of the\nevidence of natural theology and of atheological arguments such as the\nproblem of evil. By far the most sophisticated and elaborate\ndevelopment of such an argument is to be found in the work of Richard\nSwinburne (1970, 1977, 1979, 1992, 2003), who has pioneered the\napplication of Bayesian probability to questions in the philosophy of\nreligion and whose work spans the full range of natural theology.\n\n\nThe confirmatory form of the probabilistic argument is more modest;\nit aims to show that there is a considerable contribution to the\nargument for \\(M\\) arising from the facts indicated (McGrew and McGrew\n2009). It has been objected (Oppy 2006: 5\u20136) that probabilistic\narguments of this sort are of no interest unless they are founded on\nall of the relevant available evidence. But this objection\nwould, if legitimate, count equally against the use of arguments from\ncomparison of likelihoods in scientific reasoning, where they are\nubiquitous. More cautiously, one might ask why an argument that places\nno definite restrictions on the probability of \\(M\\) should be of\nany interest. One answer would be that a successful confirmatory\nargument may shift the burden of proof. If there is a substantial body\nof evidence in favor of \\(M\\), it is incumbent on those who\ndeny \\(M\\) to explain in some detail either (1) why the\nantecedent presumption against \\(M\\) should override this\nevidence or (2) what the other evidential considerations are that\nmitigate against \\(M\\).\n",
