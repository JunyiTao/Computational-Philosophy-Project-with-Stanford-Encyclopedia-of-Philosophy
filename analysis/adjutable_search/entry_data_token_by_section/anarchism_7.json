    "main_text": "Anarchism in Political Philosophy || Anarchism in the History of Political Philosophy\n2.1 Anarchism in the History of Political Philosophy\n\nThere is a long history of political anarchism. In the ancient world,\nanarchism of a sort can be found in the ideas of the Epicureans and\nCynics. Kropotkin makes this point in his 1910 encyclopedia article.\nAlthough they did not employ the term anarchism, the Epicureans and\nCynics avoided political activity, advising retreat from political\nlife in pursuit of tranquility (ataraxia) and self-control\n(autarkeai). The Cynics are also known for advocating\ncosmopolitanism: living without allegiance to any particular state or\nlegal system, while associating with human beings based upon moral\nprinciple outside of traditional state structures. Diogenes the Cynic\nhad little respect for political or religious authority. One of his\nguiding ideas was to \u201cdeface the currency\u201d. This meant not\nonly devaluing or destroying monetary currency but also a general\nrejection of the norms of civilized society (see Marshall 2010: 69).\nDiogenes often mocked political authorities and failed to offer signs\nof respect. While Diogenes actively disrespected established norms,\nEpicurus counseled retreat. He advised living unnoticed and avoiding\npolitical life (under the phrase me politeuesthai\u2014which\ncan be understood as an anti-political admonition).\n\nThe assumption that anarchy would be unhappy or unstable leads to\njustifications of political power. In Hobbes\u2019 famous phrase, in\nthe stateless\u2014anarchic\u2014condition of \u201cthe state\nnature\u201d human life would be solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and\nshort. Hobbes\u2019 social contract\u2014as well as other versions\nof the social contract theory as found for example in Locke or\nRousseau\u2014are attempts to explain how and why the political state\nemerges from out of the anarchic state of nature.\n\nAnarchists respond by claiming that the state tends to produce its own\nsort of unhappiness: as oppressive, violent, corrupt, and inimical to\nliberty. Discussions about the social contract thus revolve around the\nquestion of whether the state is better than anarchy\u2014or whether\nstates and state-like entities naturally and inevitably emerge from\nout of the original condition of anarchy. One version of this argument\nabout the inevitable emergence of states (by way of something like an\n\u201cinvisible hand\u201d) is found in Nozick\u2019s influential\nAnarchy, State, Utopia (1974). While Nozick and other\npolitical philosophers take anarchy seriously as a starting point,\nanarchists will argue that invisible hand arguments of this sort\nignore the historical actuality of states, which develop out of a long\nhistory of domination, inequality, and oppression. Murray Rothbard has\nargued against Nozick and social contract theory, saying, \u201cno\nexisting state has been immaculately conceived\u201d (Rothbard 1977:\n46). Different versions of the social contract theory, such as we find\nin John Rawls\u2019s work, view the contract situation as a heuristic\ndevice allowing us to consider justice from under \u201cthe veil of\nignorance\u201d. But anarchists will argue that the idea of the\noriginal position does not necessarily lead to the justification of\nthe state\u2014especially given background knowledge about the\ntendency of states to be oppressive. Crispin Sartwell concludes:\n\n\nEven accepting more or less all of the assumptions Rawls packs into\nthe original position, it is not clear that the contractors would not\nchoose anarchy. (Sartwell 2008: 83)\n\n\nThe author of the present essay has described anarchism that results\nfrom a critique of the social contract tradition as \u201cliberal\nsocial contract anarchism\u201d (Fiala 2013a).\n\nAn important historical touchstone is William Godwin. Unlike Locke and\nHobbes who turned to the social contract to lead us out of the\nanarchic state of nature, Godwin argued that the resulting\ngovernmental power was not necessarily better than anarchy. Locke, of\ncourse, allows for revolution when the state becomes despotic. Godwin\nbuilds upon that insight. He explained, \u201cwe must not hastily\nconclude that the mischiefs of anarchy are worse than those which\ngovernment is qualified to produce\u201d (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap.\nV, p. 736). He claimed,\n\n\nIt is earnestly to be desired that each man should be wise enough to\ngovern himself, without the intervention of any compulsory restraint;\nand, since government, even in its best state, is an evil, the object\nprincipally to be aimed at is that we should have as little of it as\nthe general peace of human society will permit. (Godwin 1793: bk III,\nchap. VII, p. 185\u20136)\n\n\nLike Rousseau, who praised the noble savage, who was free from social\nchains until forced into society, Godwin imagined original anarchy\ndeveloping into the political state, which tended on his view to\nbecome despotic. Once the state comes into being, Godwin suggests that\ndespotism is the primary problem since \u201cdespotism is as\nperennial as anarchy is transitory\u201d (Godwin 1793: bk VII, chap.\nV, p. 736).\n\nAnarchism is often taken to mean that individuals ought to be left\nalone without any unifying principle or governing power. In some cases\nanarchism is related to libertarianism (or what is sometimes called\n\u201canarcho-capitalism\u201d). But non-rule may also occur when\nthere is unanimity or consensus\u2014and hence no need for external\nauthority or a governing structure of command and obedience. If there\nwere unanimity among individuals, there would be no need for\n\u201cruling\u201d, authority, or government. The ideas of unanimity\nand consensus are associated with the positive conception of anarchism\nas a voluntary association of autonomous human beings, which promotes\ncommunal values. One version of the anarchist ideal imagines the\ndevolution of centralized political authority, leaving us with\ncommunes whose organizational structure is open-ended and\nconsensual.\n\nGiven this emphasis on communal organization it is not surprising that\npolitical anarchism has a close historical association with communism,\ndespite the connection mentioned above with free market capitalism.\nAuthors such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, and Goldman developed their\nanarchism as a response to Marx and Marxism. One of the first authors\nto explicitly affirm anarchism, Pierre Proudhon, defended a kind of\n\u201ccommunism\u201d, which he understood as being grounded in\ndecentralized associations, communes, and mutual-aid societies.\nProudhon thought that private property created despotism. He argued\nthat liberty required anarchy, concluding,\n\n\nThe government of man by man (under whatever name it be disguised) is\noppression. Society finds its highest perfection in the union of order\nwith anarchy. (Proudhon 1840 [1876: 286])\n\n\nFollowing Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, and the other so-called\n\u201cclassical anarchists\u201d, anarchism comes to be seen as a\nfocal point for political philosophy and activism.\n\nLet\u2019s turn to a conceptual analysis of different arguments made\nin defense of anarchism.\n",
