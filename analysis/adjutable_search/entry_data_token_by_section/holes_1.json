    "main_text": "Problems\n2. Theories\n\n\nThese difficulties\u2014along with some form of horror\nvacui\u2014may lead a philosopher to favor ontological parsimony\nor revisionism over naive realism about holes. A number of options are\navailable: \n\nOne may hold that holes do not exist at all, arguing that all\ntruths putatively about holes boil down to truths about holed objects\n(Jackson 1977: 132) or, more generally, that all sentences that seem\nto imply the existence of holes can be paraphrased by sentences that\nlack the implication but could in principle be used for all the same\npurposes as the original (van Inwagen 2014). This view calls for a\nsystematic way of producing the relevant paraphrases. For instance,\nthe sentence \u2018There is a hole in the carpet\u2019 can be\ntreated as a mere grammatical variant of \u2018The carpet is\nperforated\u2019; the sentence \u2018There are three round holes in\nthat piece of cheese\u2019 as a variant of \u2018That piece of\ncheese is triply-roundly-holed\u2019, etc. (Challenges: Can every quantification over holes be analyzed this way? Consider: \u2018There are as many holes in my cheese as crackers on my plate\u2019; Lewis & Lewis 1970: 207. Can a language\nbe envisaged that contains all the necessary shape predicates? Consider: \u2018There are two interlocking toroidal cavities in that piece of cheese\u2019; Casati & Varzi 1994: 180. Can\nevery hole-referring noun-phrase be de-nominalized? Consider:\n\u2018The hole in the tooth was smaller than the dentist\u2019s\nfinest probe\u2019; Geach 1968: 12.)\nOne may hold that holes do exist, but they are nothing over and\nabove the regions of spacetime at which they are found (Wake et\nal. 2007). Surely they are not just regions of space, for holes can\nmove, as happens any time you move a donut, whereas regions of space\ncannot. But as regions of spacetime, holes can be said to move in\nvirtue of having different temporal parts follow one another in\ndifferent places. (Challenge: Take the doughnut and spin it\nclockwise. Take a wedding ring, put it inside the hole in the\ndoughnut, and spin it the other way. The two holes are spinning\nin opposite directions, but the relevant temporal part of the little\nhole is a spatiotemporal part of the bigger one. Would it be spinning\nin both directions? See Lewis & Lewis 1970: 208.)\nOne may hold instead that holes are qualified portions of\nspacetime (Miller 2007). There would be nothing peculiar about such\nportions as opposed to any others that we would not normally think of\nas being occupied by ordinary material objects, just as there would be\nnothing more problematic, in principle, in determining under what\nconditions a certain portion counts as a hole than there is in\ndetermining under what conditions it counts as a dog, a statue, or\nwhatnot. (Challenge: What if there were truly unqualified portions of\nspacetime, in this or some other possible world? Would there be truly\nimmaterial entities inhabiting such portions, and would holes be among\nthem?)\nOne might also hold that holes are ordinary material\nbeings: they are neither more nor less than superficial parts of what,\non the naive view, are their material hosts (Lewis & Lewis\n1970; Mollica 2022). For every hole there is a hole-lining and for every\nhole-lining there is a hole; on this conception, the\nhole is the hole-lining.  (Challenge: This calls for an\naccount of the altered meaning of certain predicates or\nprepositions. Would holes surround themselves? Would filling a hole amount to filling space outside it? Would expanding the hole-lining\namount to enlarging the hole?)\nAlternatively, one may hold that holes are \u201cnegative\u201d\nparts of their material hosts (Hoffman & Richards 1985). On this\naccount, a donut would be a sort of hybrid mereological\naggregate\u2014the mereological sum of a positive pie together with\nthe negative bit in the middle. (Again, this calls for an account of\nthe altered meaning of certain modes of speech. For instance, making a\nhole would amount to adding a part, and changing an object to\nget rid of a hole would mean to remove a part, contrary to\nordinary usage.)\nYet another possibility is to treat holes as\n\u201cdisturbances\u201d of some sort (Karmo 1977). On this view, a\nhole is to be found in some object (its \u201cmedium\u201d)\nin the same sense in which a knot may be found in a rope or a wrinkle\nin a carpet. (The metaphysical status of such entities, however, calls\nfor refinements. Simons 1987: 308 suggested construing them as\nHusserlian moments that continuously change their fundaments, but this\nseems to suit knots and wrinkles better than holes.)\nFinally, it may be held that holes are not the particulars they\nseem to be. Perhaps they are properties, viz. spatial qualities of their owners (O\u2019Shaughnessy 2000: 333), or ways\nthings are (Meadows 2013), or relational entities whose fundamental\nmode of being is being-in (McDaniel 2010). Perhaps holes are\nways the world is, viz. non-abstract, localized absences that can serve as truth-makers for negative existentials or\nfalse-makers for positive existentials (Martin 1996). Or perhaps holes are genuine negative facts, viz. anti-instantiations of material properties by material things: an absence of F-stuff constitutes a hole insofar as it is surrounded by the presence of F-stuff (Barker & Jago 2012).\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the possibility remains of taking holes at face\nvalue, which is to say as bona fide immaterial particulars. Any such undertaking would have to account, not only for the general\nfeatures mentioned in section 1, but also for a\nnumber of additional peculiarities (Casati & Varzi 1994). Among\nothers:\n\nHoles are ontologically parasitic: they are always in\nsomething and cannot exist in isolation. (\u2018There is no such\nthing as a hole by itself\u2019, Tucholsky 1931: 100; \u2018Take away the thing, and the hole goes too\u2019, Heath 1967: 524). This is why there cannot exist a world consisting only of holes (Coggins 2010: 71).\nHoles are fillable. You don\u2019t necessarily destroy a hole by\nfilling it up (except perhaps when the filling is homogeneous with the hole-lining); you don\u2019t create a new hole by removing the\nfilling.\nHoles are locationally gracious. When you fill or put something in a hole, the hole does not squeeze to the side; it shares its location with its guest (and if the guest has a hole, you get two co-located entities of the same kind).\nHoles are mereologically structured. They have parts and can bear\npart-whole relations to one another (though not to their hosts and not to their guests).\nHoles are topologically assorted. Superficial hollows are\ndistinguished from internal cavities; straight perforations are\ndistinguished from knotted tunnels.\n\n\n\nAs is often the case, the choice between all these\nalternatives\u2014whether holes are to be subjected to Ockham\u2019s\nrazor, reduced to other entities, or taken at face value\u2014will\ndepend on one\u2019s general metaphysical inclinations (Lewis &\nLewis 1996). It may also depend on controversial details concerning\nthe nature of space and spacetime, e.g. whether they are relational or\nsubstantival (Braddon-Mitchell & Miller 2015). It is, more\ngenerally, an instance of the sort of decision philosophers have to\nmake when they scrutinize the ontology inherent in the common-sense\npicture of the world and the concepts, words, and purposes through\nwhich it is described and apprehended.\n\n",
