    "main_text": "Acquiring knowledge for language || Manual knowledge encoding\n8.1 Manual knowledge encoding\nThe best-known manually created body of commonsense knowledge is the\nCyc or ResearchCyc knowledge base (KB) (Lenat 1995). This contains an ontology of a\nfew hundred thousand concepts and several million facts and rules,\nbacked up by an inference engine. It has been applied to analysis,\ndecision support and other types of projects in business, education and\nmilitary domains. However, the Cyc ontology and KB contents have been\nmotivated primarily by knowledge engineering considerations (often for\nspecific projects) rather than by application to language\nunderstanding, and this is reflected in its heavy reliance on \nvery specific predicates expressed as concatenations of English words,\nand on higher-order operators. For example, the relation between\nkilling and dying is expressed using the predicates lastSubEvents,\nKillingByOrganism-Unique, and Dying,\nand relies on a higher-order\nrelation relationAllExists\nthat can be expanded into a quantified\nconditional statement. This remoteness from language makes it difficult\nto apply the Cyc KB to language understanding, especially if the goal\nis to extract relevant concepts and axioms from this KB and integrate\nthem with concepts and axioms formalized in a more linguistically\noriented representation (as opposed to adopting the CycL language, Cyc\nKB, axioms about English, and inference mechanisms wholesale)\n(e.g., Conesa et al. 2010).\nOther examples of hand-coded knowledge bases are the Component\nLibrary (CLib) (Barker et al. 2001), and a collection of commonsense\npsychological axioms by Hobbs and Gordon (2005). CLib provides a broad\nupper (i.e., high-level) ontology of several hundred concepts, and\naxioms about basic actions (conveying, entering,\nbreaking, etc.) and resultant change. However, the\nframe-based Kleo knowledge representation used in CLib\nis not close to language, and the coverage of the English lexicon is\nsparse. The psychological axioms of Hobbs and Gordon are naturally\nnarrow in focus (memories, beliefs, plans, and goals), and it remains\nto be seen whether they can be used effectively in conjunction with\nlanguage-derived logical forms (of the \u201cflat\u201d type favored by Hobbs)\nfor inference in discourse contexts.\nKnowledge adaptation from semi-formalized sources can, for example,\nconsist of extracting part-of-speech and subcategorization information\nas well as stock phrases and idioms from appropriate dictionaries. It\nmay also involve mapping hypernym hierarchies, meronyms (parts), or\nantonyms, as catalogued in sources like WordNet, into some form usable\nfor disambiguation and inference. The main limitations of manually\ncoded lexical knowledge are its grounding in linguistic intuitions\nwithout direct consideration of its role in language understanding,\nand its inevitable incompleteness, given the ever-expanding and\nshifting vocabulary, jargon, and styles of expression in all living\nlanguages. \nBesides these sources of lexical knowledge, there are also sources of\nworld knowledge in semi-formalized form, such as tabulations and\ngazetteers of various sorts, and \u201cinfo boxes\u201d in online knowledge\nresources such as Wikipedia (e.g.,\nthe entries for notable personages\ncontain a box with summary attributes such as date of birth, date of\ndeath, residence, citizenship, ethnicity, fields of endeavor, awards,\nand others). But to the extent that such sources provide knowledge in a\nregimented, and thus easily harvested form, they do so only for named\nentities (such as people, organizations, places, and movies) and a few\nentity types (such as biological species and chemical compounds).\nMoreover, much of our knowledge about ordinary concepts, such as that\nof a tree or that of driving a car, is not easily captured in the form\nof attribute-value pairs, and is generally not available in that form.\n",
