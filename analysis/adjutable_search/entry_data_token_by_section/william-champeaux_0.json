Most of what we know of William of\nChampeaux's life and work has been refracted down to us through the\nprism of a man who hated him. Peter Abelard lost almost every battle\nwith William, his teacher and political enemy, yet he tells us that\nWilliam was a discredited, defeated, jealous, and resentful man.\nAbelard claims to have humiliated William in debate, driving him from\nthe Paris schools. He alleges that, in defeat, William cast himself in\nthe role of monastic reformer only to advance his political career by\nan unearned reputation for piety. Still, even Abelard recognized that\nWilliam was no fraud, calling him \"first in reputation and in fact,\"\nand relocating to study under his tutelage (HC; trans. Radice\n1974).\n\n\nOn the scholarly front, Abelard presents only half the story. He brags\nof forcing William to abandon a firmly-held realist theory of\nuniversals, but, rather than come over to Abelard's vocalist or\nnominalist cause, William developed a second, more sophisticated,\nrealist view. So what might have appeared as an expression of\nintellectual honesty and academic rigor on William's part, Abelard\npresents as somehow shameful. What Abelard leaves out is how much he\nlearned from William. Now that more of William's work has become\navailable, it is clear that William prodded Abelard to give up\nna\u00efve vocalism and develop the complex semantic theory we now\nassociate with Abelard's nominalism.\n\n\nThe extent of William's and Abelard's involvement on opposite sides of\nthe major political struggles of the day is also beginning to come to\nlight. William was a man of considerable influence in the monastic\nreform movement. Abelard was a man of considerably less influence\nallied with the opposite faction. It is probably true that Abelard\nattracted the better students and so precipitated William's move from\nParis to St. Victor. But far from retiring in shame, William became a\nstatesman, ambassador, and confidant to the Pope, all the while\nretaining enough political clout to prevent Abelard from either\nholding his former chair as canon of Notre Dame or establishing a\nschool in Paris. One recent biographer of Abelard points out that in\n1119, while Abelard was recovering from his castration and was soon to\nbe facing charges of heresy, William was a bishop acting as papal\nnegotiator to the court of Emperor Henry V.  Unfortunately for\nWilliam's reputation, it was Abelard whose writings captured the\nimagination of readers in later centuries (Clanchy 1997: 296ff).\n\n\nVery little is known about William's early life and education.  The\ndate usually assigned for his birth is 1070, but this may be off by as\nmuch as a decade. In 1094 leaders of the monastic reform movement\nappointed William as Master of Notre Dame. If this date is correct, he\nwould have been only 24 at the time, and this was a crucial moment for\nthe reformers. In 1094 King Philip I had been excommunicated for his\n\"illegal marriage,\" and any person appointed to be Master at Notre\nDame would have to have been an established scholar with considerable\npolitical influence, something not usually found in 24\nyear-olds. Thus, a date of 1060 or earlier may not be unlikely for\nWilliam's birth (Iwakuma forthcoming c).\n\n Little is known of William's education before he took this important\npost.  He is known to have studied with Anselm of Laon and a certain\nManegold, but it is unclear whether this was the theologian, Manegold\nof Lautenbach, or the grammarian, Manegold of Chartres. It is even\nsuspected that William studied with the vocalist Roscelin of\nCompi\u00e8gne.\n\n Early in the first decade of the twelfth century, probably in 1104,\nWilliam became archdeacon of Paris. In 1108 the reformist party\nreceived a setback when King Luis VI, King Philip's son by his\n\"illegal marriage\" ascended the throne. William resigned as archdeacon\nto move to the abbey of St. Victor and the Paris suburbs, where he\ncontinued to teach and remained an influential reformer. Both Hugh of\nSt. Victor and Bernard of Clairvaux were among William's\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9s from this period at St. Victor.\n\n In 1113, he was appointed bishop of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne. He\ncontinued to act as papal legate and negotiator and remained\ninfluential in the reform movement, particularly through his patronage\nof Bernard of Clairvaux. His continued scholarly reputation is\ndemonstrated in the somewhat ludicrous tale of Rupert of Duetz, who,\nin 1117, set himself on a quest to challenge William of Champeaux and\nAnselm of Laon to intellectual combat (Clanchy 1997: 143). On January\n18, 1122, William took the habit of a Cistercian and died at Clairvaux\neight days later.\n\n William's corpus of writings is not widely available and a great deal\nmore textual work needs to be done before any assessment can be made\nabout his broader philosophical significance. Nevertheless, his basic\nphilosophical commitments and some of his characteristic views are\nknown. The texts we do have indicate that he started his career as a\nrealist in matters of logic and metaphysics and that his commitment to\nrealism grew stronger with the appearance of the vocalists and early\nnominalists. Thanks to Abelard's criticisms, William is best known for\nhis realist theories of universals. In response to the vocalist\nchallenge, he seems to have held something like the Cratylus\ntheory of language: the nature of words is intimately tied to the\nnature of the things they name. In logic, some vocalists claimed that\nthe force of inference arises from words or ideas, but William argued\nthat this is to be found instead in some thing or relation between\nthings, which he identified as the locus or medium of\nargument. He interpreted Aristotle's Categories as ten\ngeneral things, not ten general words as the vocalists\nmaintained. These and other claims suggest a broadly realist\nphilosophical outlook. It is possible that fragments and excerpts of\nWilliam's work passed down to us by his near contemporaries are those\nin which he was debating with the vocalists, and so we do not know\nwhether they represent William's deepest commitments or only brief\nforays into an important debate.\n\n William's views are known mostly through references in contemporary\nworks, especially those of Abelard. Though several of William's works\nhave been identified, very few have been edited, and none has been\ntranslated into English. The Introductions \u2014\nIntroductiones dialecticae secundum Wilgelmum\u00a0\n(ISW)\u00a0 and Introductiones dialecticae secundum magistrum G.\nPaganellum (IGP) \u2014 are very early works, possibly dating\nfrom William's arrival in Paris in 1094. Edited with these two\nIntroductions are two brief discussions of media or\nloci, and the beginning of an early commentary on Porphyry,\nall likely by William (Iwakuma 1993; ISW is also in de Rijk 1967).\nThese texts defend some of William's characteristic doctrines, but in\n1094 the vocalist movement had not yet begun to exert any real\ninfluence in Paris, and so it is likely that he had not yet been\nforced to articulate his views in response to serious criticism.\n\n Some of William's later works have also been identified. Although no\neditions have been published, several articles contain extensive\nexcerpts. William is known to have written commentaries on Porphyry's\nIsagoge, Aristotle's Categories and De\nInterpretatione, Boethius' De Differentiis\nTopicis, and Cicero's De Inventione and\nRhetorica ad Herennium.  Some of his theological writings,\nalong with those of other leading French theologians, were compiled in\nthe later twelfth century under the title Liber\nPancrisis. These have been edited as the\n\u2018Sententiae\u2019 of William of Champeaux (Lottin\n1956). The Liber Pancrisis is thought to be a\ncompilation of the best Parisian theology of the period, and so it is\nlikely to represent William's most advanced views.\n",
