    "main_text": "The Frankfurt School: Origins, Influences, and Development || Origins and Generations\n1.1 Origins and Generations\n\nIn their attempt to combine philosophy and social science in a\ncritical theory with emancipatory intent, the wide-ranging work of the\nfirst generation of the Frankfurt School was methodologically\ninnovative. They revised and updated Marxism by integrating it with\nthe work of Sigmund Freud, Max Weber, and Friedrich Nietzsche while\ndeveloping a model of radical critique that is immanently anchored in\nsocial reality. They used this model to analyze a wide range of\nphenomena \u2013 from authoritarianism as a political formation and\nas it manifests in both the nuclear family and deep-seated\npsychological dispositions, to the effects of capitalism on\npsychological, social, cultural, and political formations as well as\non the production of knowledge itself (for excellent guides, see\nThompson 2017 and Gordon et al. 2019).\n\nMax Horkheimer outlined the original research agenda for the Frankfurt\nSchool in his 1931 inaugural lecture upon becoming director of the\nInstitute for Social Research in Frankfurt (founded in 1923). He\nproposed an interdisciplinary research program combining philosophy\nand social theory with psychology, political economy, and cultural\nanalysis (Horkheimer 1931). In that way, \u201csocial\nphilosophy\u201d aims at providing an encompassing interpretation of\nsocial reality as a whole \u2013 as \u201csocial totality,\u201d to\nuse a concept central to the Marxist tradition (Jay 1984).\n\nOther key figures of the first generation include Theodor W. Adorno,\nHerbert Marcuse, and Walter Benjamin, along with Erich Fromm,\nFriedrich Pollock, Leo L\u00f6wenthal, Franz Neumann, Otto\nKirchheimer, and figures like Siegfried Kracauer, who belonged to the\nbroader circle for a few years (for rich historical accounts, see Jay\n1973, Buck-Morss 1977, Dubiel 1978, Wiggershaus 1986, Wheatland 2009).\nThe work of the largely Jewish members of the first generation was\ndeeply marked by the rise of National Socialism, the experience of\nexile, and, for some of its inner circle, their return to Germany\nafter 1945. After the Nazis closed the Institute, Horkheimer, who had\nalready moved it to Geneva, re-established it at Columbia University\nin 1934, where he was soon joined by Pollock, Marcuse, and\nL\u00f6wenthal, while Adorno did not emigrate to the US until 1938.\nHorkheimer, Adorno, and Pollock moved the Institute from New York to\nLos Angeles in 1941. Those three reestablished the Institute in\nGermany after the War, with Horkeimer as director from 1951 to 1958\nand Adorno from 1958 to 1969. Key figures who worked with first\ngeneration figures during this period emerged as the second\ngeneration: J\u00fcrgen Habermas, Alfred Schmidt, Albrecht Wellmer,\nOskar Negt, and Claus Offe.\n\nHabermas was the leading figure of this second generation, taking up\nHorkheimer\u2019s chair in Frankfurt in 1964 before moving to a\nresearch post in Starnberg in 1971. Habermas returned to Frankfurt in\n1981, retiring from this position in 1994. Axel Honneth worked closely\nwith Habermas in the 1980s and took over the chair in social\nphilosophy in Frankfurt in 1996; Honneth was also director of, and\nlargely responsible for the revival of, the Institute for Social\nResearch in Frankfurt from 2001 to 2018. He is considered a leading\nfigure in the third generation, along with Seyla Benhabib, Nancy\nFraser, and Christoph Menke (Anderson 2000, Allen 2010). Going beyond\nthe second and third generations of the Frankfurt School, there are\nfar too many figures to list; and the focal points for critical theory\nin this tradition have expanded, both geographically \u2013 with\nprominent figures in the United States and an active reception in\nLatin America \u2013 and thematically \u2013 for example, with a\nturn to feminism (see\n \u00a74.1.1).\n",
