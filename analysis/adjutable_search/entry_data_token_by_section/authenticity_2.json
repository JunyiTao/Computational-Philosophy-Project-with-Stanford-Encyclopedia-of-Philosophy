    "main_text": "Origins and Meaning of the Concept of Authenticity || Authenticity and the self\n1.3 Authenticity and the self\n\nAnother decisive factor in the development of the ideal of\nauthenticity was that it emerged together with a distinctively modern\nconception of the self. This is visible in the work of Rousseau, who\nargues that the orientation toward life that should guide the conduct\none chooses should come from a source within. This led to questions\nabout inwardness, self-reflection and introspection, many of them\naddressed in his Confessions (1770). When the space of\ninteriority becomes a guiding authority, the individual must detect\nand distinguish central impulses, feelings and wishes from ones that\nare less central or conflict with one\u2019s central motives. In\nother words, interiority must be divided into what is at the core and\nwhat is peripheral. In this picture, the measure of one\u2019s\nactions is whether they spring from and express essential aspects of\none\u2019s identity or whether they come from a peripheral place.\n\nSuch a conception of the self exhibits decisive parallels to the\ntradition of \u201creligious individualism\u201d that centers\nreligious life on the individual and stresses the importance of\ninwardness and the introspective examination of one\u2019s inner\nmotives, intentions and conscience. Investigating the characteristics\nof the modern subject of inwardness, Foucault (1980: 58\u201360)\nsuggests that \u201cit seems to us that truth, lodged in our most\nsecret nature, \u2018demands\u2019 only to surface.\u201d For\nFoucault, confession\u2014the look inward to monitor one\u2019s\ninterior life and to tell certain \u201ctruths\u201d about\noneself\u2014has become a part of a cultural life, reaching from\nreligious contexts to psychological therapy. The radicalization of the\ndistinction between true and false interiority has led to new\npossibilities; inner states, motivations and feelings are now\nincreasingly thought of as objectifiable and malleable in different\ncontexts.\n\nRousseau also adds that acting on motives that spring from the\nperiphery of the self, while ignoring or denying essential aspects of\none\u2019s self, simply amounts to self-betrayal and annihilation of\nthe self. Rousseau\u2019s The New Heloise (1997 [1761])\nemphasizes this aspect by showing how the novel accentuates the\nsignificant costs and the potential self-alienation involved in\nsuppressing one\u2019s deepest motivations. But, in addition, in the\nDiscourse on the Origin of Inequality, Rousseau argues that,\nwith the emergence of a competitive public sphere, the ability to turn\ninward is increasingly compromised, because competitive relations\nrequire intense role-playing, which Rousseau calls an \u201cexcessive\nlabor\u201d (Rousseau 1992 [1754]: 22). The ongoing instrumental\nrole-playing not only causes alienation, but ultimately inequality and\ninjustice, since it destroys the immanent moral understanding with\nwhich, according to Rousseau, humans are hard-wired. Social life\nrequires identification with social roles, but because role identity\nis determined by other people\u2019s normative expectations,\nrole-playing leads to a tension that might be understood as a matter\nof politics more than anything else (Schmid 2017). \n",
