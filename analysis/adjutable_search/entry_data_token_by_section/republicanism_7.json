    "main_text": "Republican Liberty: Problems and Debates || Republican Freedom and the Human Good\n2.3 Republican Freedom and the Human Good\n\nSo far we have assumed that, however ultimately defined, republican\nfreedom is always a good thing. Some have wondered whether this is the\ncase, however. This objection is most often expressed via the example\nof benevolent care-giving relationships. On the republican view that\none enjoys freedom only to the extent that one is independent from\narbitrary power, it would seem that children do not enjoy republican\nfreedom with respect to their parents. But surely, one might suppose,\nthe parent-child relationship is (in most cases) an extremely valuable\none, and so we would not want greater republican freedom in such a\ncontext. Republican freedom is, perhaps, not always a good thing\n(Ferejohn 2001).\n\nAs stated, this objection rests on a conceptual error, though (as we\nshall see) it points to an important set of issues as yet\nunder-developed in the contemporary civic republican literature. The\nerror in the above example stems from our confusing the overall\nevaluation of a whole with an evaluation of its parts considered\nseparately. It is undeniable that, at least in the ordinary course of\nthings, parent-child relationships are extremely valuable, considered\nas a whole; it does not follow from this, however, that the\nrelationship is necessarily valuable in each and every part. For the\nobjection to hold, it must be the case\u2014not only that the\nparent-child relationship is valuable overall\u2014but further, that\nthat it would actually be worse if, holding all its other features\nconstant, it involved less arbitrary power. But this is highly\ndoubtful. Clearly, the introduction of children\u2019s rights into\nwestern law was a boon, precisely because it reduced the degree of\narbitrary power to which children are inevitably subject (which is to\nsay, because it increased their republican freedom). That their\nrepublican freedom cannot be increased still further, perhaps, without\ndestroying family life altogether, and thus losing its many other\nbenefits, is neither here nor there.\n\nWhat consideration of this faulty objection does reveal, however, is\nthat republican freedom is simply one good among others, with which it\nmight come into conflict (Markell 2008). The challenge for\ncontemporary civic republicans, therefore, is less to show why\nnon-domination is an important human good (for which there are plenty\nof good arguments in the literature: see Pettit 1997; Maynor 2003;\nLaborde 2008; G\u00e4deke 2020), but rather to show how it fits into a\nbroader moral framework, and specifically, the comparative weight we\nshould assign to republican freedom vis-\u00e0-vis other important\ngoods in the achievement of human flourishing (or, if non-domination\nis regarded as a deontological side-constraint, as suggested by Forst\n2013, its relative priority vis-\u00e0-vis other side-constraints).\nPettit (2005, 2014) sketches a case for the relative priority of\nrepublican liberty on more or less pragmatic grounds: roughly\nspeaking, he argues that political doctrines will be most effective\nwhen they concentrate on as few core values as possible, and\naccordingly that the best values to concentrate on are those whose\npromotion will service as wide a range of needs as possible.\nRepublican freedom is just such a good, he claims, insofar as our\nefforts to promote it will necessarily have far-reaching beneficial\nconsequences. It will be more clear why this might be so in light of\nthe discussion in part four below, but regardless there remains\nconsiderable work to be done developing the foundations of republican\ntheory.\n",
