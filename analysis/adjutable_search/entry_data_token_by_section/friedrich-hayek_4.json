Planned Orders Are Inferior\n\nIf we understand the principles that drive the logic of the system, we\nmay be able to predict that a population of insects will evolve\nresistance to a pesticide. We may be able to predict that a society\nthat declares war on drugs will lose. Beyond the question of what we\ncan predict, then, Hayek has a further and more precise target:\nhowever much we can predict, there is a drastic limit to what we can\nsimply\n decide.[2]\n No one can decide that people won\u2019t respond in predictable ways\nto perverse incentives unintentionally created by a central plan, in\nthe same way that no one can decide that insects will not become\nresistant to an insecticide.\n\nThis point, as Adam Smith observed, is not obvious. There is a class\nof technocrats who will not appreciate the difficulty. As Smith\nfamously observed, and as Hayek quotes approvingly, the \u201cman of\nsystem\u201d \n\n\nseems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great\nsociety with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces\nupon a chess-board. He does not consider that the pieces upon the\nchess-board have no other principle of motion besides that which the\nhand impresses upon them; but that, in the great chess-board of human\nsociety, every single piece has a principle of motion of its own,\naltogether different from that which the legislature might choose to\nimpress upon it. If those two principles coincide and act in the same\ndirection, the game of human society will go on easily and\nharmoniously, and is very likely to be happy and successful. If they\nare opposite or different, the game will go on miserably, and the\nsociety must be at all times in the highest degree of disorder (Smith\n1790, 234).\n\n\nThe system has a logic. Planners cannot change that logic. Their main\ndecision is whether to work with that logic or against it (which Smith\nregards as a choice between harmony and misery). Smith holds that\nplanners who disregard economic logic are deciding in effect to\nsacrifice their \u201cpawns,\u201d something that a person of true\nbenevolence would not do.\n\nWhen Hayek explains the obstacle to effective central planning, his\nclaim is not merely the Smithian point that information is widely\ndispersed and therefore hard to acquire. Rather, it is impossible to\nacquire (Hayek 1973, 51). When prices are set periodically by a\ncentral planner, rather than instantaneously by consumers and\nproducers who are the first and typically the only people to have that\ninformation in reliable and timely form, prices inevitably carry less\nreliable, less timely information. As Hayek notes,\n\n\nIf we possess all the relevant information, if we can start out from a\ngiven system of preferences, and if we command complete knowledge of\navailable means, the problem which remains is purely one of logic.\nThat is, the answer to the question of what is the best use of our\navailable means is implicit in our assumptions. This, however, is\nemphatically not the economic problem which society faces. And the\neconomic calculus which we have developed to solve this logical\nproblem, though an important step toward the solution of the economic\nproblem of society, does not yet provide an answer to it. The reason\nfor this is that the \u201cdata\u201d from which the economic\ncalculus starts are never for the whole society \u201cgiven\u201d to\na single mind which could work out the implications and can never be\nso given (Hayek 1945, 519).\n\n\nSoviet central planners made decisions by checking prices on\ninternational markets, but suppose there were no information about\nsupply and demand to be had anywhere. Suppose you are a planner, but\nall you know is that demands are coming in for wire and for jewelry.\nHow do you decide whether to direct factories to make wire out of\ncopper or platinum, or whether smiths should make jewelry out of gold\nor silver? How do you decide who should get silver jewelry and who\nshould get gold? How do you decide whether anyone at all should get\njewelry, as opposed to reserving all such metals for use as wire?\n\nWhen consumers are not paying for what they receive, their demand is\neffectively infinite. Inevitably, a central planner\u2019s task\nbecomes one of cost containment. Worse yet, a planner with no measure\nof cost has only a limited basis for deciding what to count as\ncontaining cost. If a given ton of steel can make one car or ten\nrefrigerators, which way of using steel is economical? How does a\nplanner decide whether to invest in upgrading water supplies or\nnuclear reactors? If all you know as a producer is that people are\nasking for infinitely more than you can give, then eventually you turn\na deaf ear, deliver your quota, and pay no attention to whether\ndemands from below (from customers) are being met. The only demands\nthat have consequences are demands from above (that is, those which\ncome to you through your supervisors).\n\nSuppose that prices are set by planners. Hayek says with a thought\nmore characteristic of neoclassical economists: \u201cOnly prices\ndetermined on the free market will bring it about that demand equals\nsupply\u201d (Hayek 1960, 63). Price controls\u2014floors and\nceilings\u2014make buyers and sellers less able to respond to the\nsignals they would send each other if they could raise their offer or\nlower their asking price. If price cannot rise, then buyers cannot\nsignal producers that demand has increased and that producers would\nsell more if they were to increase supply. And if producers do not\nincrease supply, rising demand results in shortages rather than\neconomic growth. (See especially Zwolinski 2008 for further\n elaboration.)[3]\n\nA central planner could have the world\u2019s most powerful computer,\nbeyond anything imagined when Hayek published \u201cUse of\nKnowledge\u201d in 1945. No computer, however, could solve the\nproblem that Hayek was trying to articulate. The problem is not lack\nof processing power so much as a lack of access to the information in\nthe first place. That much seems clear enough, but the problem has a\ndeeper level. Hayek may not have said this in so many words, yet it\nseems the most charitable way of reconstructing his more fundamental\npoint. That is, the problem is not merely lack of access to\ninformation; rather the information does not exist. There is no truth\nabout what prices should be, accessible or otherwise, except to the\nextent that prices represent what customers are paying for a given\nservice. This is the precise way in which prices are of service to a\ncommunity (1944, 51\u201352).\n\nFor example, suppose that a manufacturer figures out how to make an\n\u201cepipen\u201d that can save the lives of consumers otherwise at\nrisk of fatal allergic reaction to bee stings. Suppose the\nmanufacturer can produce a limited supply of epipens for a little less\nthan a hundred dollars each, and proceeds to offer them for sale for a\nhundred dollars. Suppose that the manufacturer finds that buyers line\nup by the thousands wanting to buy the pens, and suppose that there\nemerges a group of \u201cscalpers\u201d willing to stand in line for\nweeks, who buy all the pens for a hundred dollars each, then resell\nthe pens for two hundred dollars, then three hundred, then four, and\ndemand remains strong. Hayek would predict that if we let the price\nsignals be the marvels that they are, then other producers will jump\nin and begin to manufacture pens for one or two hundred dollars each.\nEventually the demand is met, and the scalpers go away. Meanwhile, new\nproducers drawn by the spike in profitability invent a new process\nthat enables them to produce the pens for ninety dollars, then eighty,\nand again the price will fall, as competition leads the price signal\nto track the falling cost of production. Of course, if we issue a\npatent or a licensing scheme or some other way of preventing rival\nproducers from entering the market, then this will not occur. By the\nsame token, if we impose a price ceiling of a hundred dollars, then no\nsignal is sent to prospective rivals, unless scalpers send the signal\nto rivals willing to produce for the black market. Or if there is some\nother reason why it is impossible to increase the supply, then prices\nmay drift up toward the limits of a customer\u2019s willingness to\npay. Barring this, there are many ways for kings, legislators, or\nother planners to interfere, but price signals, if left alone, are an\ninimitably rapid and incomprehensibly vast generator of information:\nsupply and demand tend to equilibrate, and to converge on a price in\nthe neighborhood of the cost of production. To a uniquely reliable\ndegree, a product will tend to end up in a consumer\u2019s hands just\nin case that particular consumer wants the product enough to pay what\nit cost to produce it. \n\nAlthough computers cannot solve the problem, Hayek thought radically\ndispersed decision making by buyers and sellers can and does solve the\nproblem, so far as it can be solved. Sellers who charge too much end\nup without customers; they learn to be more efficient or else find\nsome other line of work.\n [4]\n Buyers who want x but consider it overpriced stay home for a\nwhile, waiting for the price to fall, but when they see x\nflying off the shelves, some of them learn something about themselves:\nthat they would rather have the product at that price than not have it\nat all. To Hayek, only a price mechanism can process changing\ninformation almost instantaneously. Ironically, the most\nefficient thing a central planner could possibly do would be to set a\nprice right where it would have been without the planner\u2019s\nintervention.\n",
