Treatises etc. \n\n\nCommentaries and textbooks are not the only types of texts used for\ninterpreting, discussing, defending, adapting and transforming the\ndoctrines of Aristotle (and his commentators) in the\nRenaissance. Specialized treatises cover a wide range of subjects:\non the immortality of the soul, on innate heat, on the agent sense,\non the regressus, on vapour, on rhetoric imitation,\n\u2026.  These treatises often treat a certain subject more or\nless for its own sake, and not just in order to find out what was\nAristotle\u2019s opinion on it\u2014though the author will often settle\nfor a position that he believes to be the position of Aristotle.\n\n\nMany printed collections of theses (for doctoral dissertations or\nother purposes) can also be considered as specialized monographs\n\u2014 though in the form we have them most of them do not provide us\nwith the argumentations that lead to the assumptions made.\n\n\nFrancisco Patrizi\u2019s Discussiones peripatetic\u00e6\n(Patrizi, 1581), although not a pro-Aristotelian text, is one of the\nmost learned works on the subject of Aristotle and the Aristotelian\ntraditions we have from the Renaissance.  And it does not easily\nfit into any of the sections used here.\n",
