How can distinct beliefs be about one and the same object?\n\nThe problem of the relational nature of the contents of true singular\nthoughts can be made more acute by the following puzzle that exercised\nGottlob Frege (1892): how can one rationally hold two\ndistinct singular beliefs that are both about one and the same object?\nAs we shall see momentarily, this puzzle is related to a second\npuzzle: the puzzle of how a statement expressing a belief about\nidentity can both be true and informative. If the belief relation is a\ngenuine relation, then it would seem that it is like kicking:\nif Jacques Chirac kicked Lionel Jospin and if Lionel Jospin was the\nFrench Prime minister in 2001, then Jacques Chirac kicked the French\nPrime minister in 2001. Not so with belief, as we shall see\nmomentarily. Notice that in ordinary contexts, the word\n\u2018belief\u2019 can be used to denote either a person\u2019s\nstate or the content of that state.\n\nEver since Frege, it has been standard practice in analytic philosophy\nto investigate the intentional structure of much human thought by\ninquiring into the logical structure of the language used by speakers\nto express it or to ascribe it to others. (See, e.g., Dummett (1973)\nfor a forceful justification.) Suppose that Ava correctly believes\nthat Hesperus is shining as a result of seeing that Hesperus shines.\nSuppose also that she fails to believe that Phosphorus is shining\nbecause, although she correctly believes that Hesperus is called\n\u2018Hesperus,\u2019 she incorrectly believes that\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 is the name of a different planet (that she\nis not currently seeing) and she fails to know that\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 is in fact another name for Hesperus. So\nwhereas the first belief report is true, the second belief report is\nfalse:\n\nAva believes that Hesperus is shining.\nAva believes that Phosphorus is shining.\n\n\nGiven that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 are\njust names of the same object, how can Ava believe one thing and\ndisbelieve the other? Given that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 apply to the same object, it would seem that\n\u2018Hesperus is shining\u2019 is true if and only if\n\u2018Phosphorus is shining\u2019 is true and that these two\nsentences express one and the same proposition. If what is essential\nto the proposition that Ava believes is that it is about Hesperus and\nthe property of shining, how can she believe one thing and fail to\nbelieve the other since both are about Hesperus?\n\nAnother related puzzle is the puzzle of how identity statements can\nboth be true and informative. It seems clear that Ava could not doubt\nthat \u2018Hesperus is Hesperus\u2019 expresses a truth. But it\nseems clear that she can\u2014in fact she does\u2014doubt that\n\u2018Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019 expresses a truth. In fact, when\nshe learns that \u2018Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019 does express a\ntruth, she is surprised. How can it be? (See Richard 1990 and Salmon\n1986.)\n\nFrege (1892) offered a very influential solution to both puzzles. This\ncommon solution is based on his famous distinction between the\nreference (or Bedeutung) and the sense (or\nSinn) of an English proper name. The sense, which is the mode\nof presentation of the reference, is presumably something abstract\nthat can both be instantiated by a concrete individual and present to,\nor grasped by, a mind. This distinction is in some ways reminiscent of\nthe distinction between extension and intension and is inconsistent\nwith John Stuart Mill\u2019s (1884) view that proper names have a\ndenotation and no connotation.\n\nThe reason (3) and (4) can, on Frege\u2019s view, have different\ntruth-values is that the embedded sentences or\n\u2018that\u2019-clauses in (3) and (4)\u2014namely (5) and\n(6)\u2014do not express one and the same proposition. They\nexpress different propositions (or thoughts). Frege uses the German\nGedanke for \u2018thought.\u2019\n\nHesperus is shining.\nPhosphorus is shining.\n\n\nHow can (5) and (6) express different propositions? Unlike\nnon-ordinary contexts such as (3) and (4), in which they are part of\nan embedded \u2018that\u2019-clause, in ordinary contexts such as\n(5) and (6), \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 have\nthe same Bedeutung (or reference). But they have different\nsenses (Sinn) or different modes of presentation of their\ncommon reference. On the Fregean view, what is essential to the\nthought or proposition expressed by an utterance of a sentence\ncontaining a singular term is its sense, not its reference.\nPropositions have senses, not individuals, as constituents. Ava lacks\na piece of knowledge. But given that ignorance is not irrationality,\nAva can rationally believe that Hesperus is shining and fail to\nbelieve that Phosphorus is shining. Similarly, a statement expressing\na belief about identity can both be true and informative because the\ntwo singular terms that flank the identity sign in an identity\nstatement have both a sense and a reference. The identity statement is\ntrue because they have the same reference. It is informative because\nthey have different senses or they present their common reference via\ndifferent modes of presentation.\n\nOn the Fregean view, in (3) and (4), \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 do not have their ordinary reference (or\nBedeutung), namely the planet to which they both apply: they\nhave an \u2018oblique\u2019 reference. In (3), the oblique reference\nof \u2018Hesperus\u2019 is its ordinary sense. In (4), the oblique\nreference of \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 is its ordinary sense. And we\nalready agreed that \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 in (5) and (6) have different ordinary\nsenses. So in (3), \u2018Hesperus\u2019 has an \u2018oblique\u2019\nor \u2018indirect\u2019 sense, which is the mode of presentation of\nthe ordinary sense \u2018Hesperus\u2019 has in (5). Similarly, in\n(4) \u2018Phosphorus\u2019 has an \u2018oblique\u2019 sense, which\nis the mode of presentation of the ordinary sense\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 has in (5). On the Fregean view, a thought or\nbelief can be about a concrete individual (its reference),\nbut what matters to the individuation (or the identity) of the\nthought\u2019s content is not the reference of the singular term, but\nthe sense or mode of presentation of the reference, i.e., something\nabstract.
