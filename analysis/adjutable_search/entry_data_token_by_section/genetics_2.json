    "main_text": "The Science of Genetics || Genetics and Eugenics\n1.2 Genetics and Eugenics\n\nFrancis Galton, the younger cousin of Darwin, coined the term\n\u201ceugenics\u201d in 1883, meaning \u201cgood birth\u201d\n(Galton 1883). In nature, Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution by\nnatural selection suggested that the fit members of a population would\noutbreed the unfit members; Galton and other eugenicists, however,\nworried that this natural process was not playing out in human\npopulations\u2014that, in humans, the unfit were outbreeding the fit.\nA variety of social, economic, and political forces, the eugenicists\nwarned, inclined people with undesirable traits (like criminality and\n\u201cfeeblemindedness\u201d\u2014a catchall term for intellectual\ndisability) to have more children, while people with desirable traits\n(like high intelligence and creativity) were incentivized to have\nfewer children (Paul 1995).\n\nWhen genetics came on the scientific scene in 1900, many eugenicists\nembraced the new theory of inheritance, believing that it offered a\nscientific foundation for their social vision. The eugenicists assumed\nthat human traits like criminality and intelligence played by the same\nhereditary rules as the traits that Mendel and Morgan made famous,\nwhere single genes were associated with single traits. The eugenic\ntask, then, was to decrease the transmission of undesirable genes to\nthe next generation, and increase the transmission of desirable genes.\nEugenicists advocated for a variety of social and political\ninterventions to produce more fit and less unfit\nhumans\u2014sterilization of the unfit, immigration restriction acts\nthat prohibited the influx of people from entire nations deemed unfit,\nanti-miscegenation laws that restricted \u201crace mixing\u201d; as\nwell as \u201cfitter family contests\u201d that praised the\nfecundity of fit couples, eugenic sermon contests that encouraged\nclergy to preach the religious justifications for eugenics, and\neugenic guidance to couples considering reproduction (Rosen 2004;\nLombardo 2008).\n\nBy the 1940s and 1950s, a number of social and scientific trends\nemerged that undermined the eugenicists\u2019 agenda. At the\nconclusion of World War II, it became clear that Nazi atrocities\ntargeting certain populations for eradication were inspired by eugenic\nideas cultivated in the very countries that fought against Germany.\nSocial commentators pointed out that \u201cfit humans\u201d and\n\u201cunfit humans\u201d were not scientific terms; rather, they\nwere racist, sexist, classist, and nativist concepts designed to\nprivilege wealthy, educated White people and devalue socioeconomically\ndisadvantaged minority populations. On the scientific side, social\nsciences like anthropology and sociology drew increasing attention to\nthe social and economic forces at work in populations that contributed\nto criminality, destitution, and mental illness. And genetics\ntoo\u2014the eugenicists\u2019 chosen science\u2014ultimately\ninvalidated eugenics. Complex human traits like intelligence and\nantisocial behavior were not the result of any single gene; they were\nthe result of many genetic and environmental factors all working in\ncomplicated and generally unpredictable ways over the course of human\ndevelopment (Tabery 2014). That insight, alongside the social science\nobservations, ensured that no amount of sterilization or immigration\nrestriction would eliminate the traits eugenicists found undesirable\n(Kevles 1985).\n\n\u201cEugenics\u201d as a term fell out of favor by mid-century.\nEugenic programs rebranded themselves as \u201cmedical\ngenetics\u201d programs; eugenic journals and organizations dropped\nthe word in exchange for phrases like \u201csocial biology\u201d and\n\u201chuman genetics\u201d. This terminological shift, however,\nbelied an ongoing interest among many scientists and non-scientists\nalike in using the insights of genetics to control human heredity\n(entry:\n eugenics).\n",
