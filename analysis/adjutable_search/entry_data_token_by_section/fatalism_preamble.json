    "main_text": "\n\nThough the word \u201cfatalism\u201d is commonly used to refer to an\nattitude of resignation in the face of some future event or events\nwhich are thought to be inevitable, philosophers usually use the word\nto refer to the view that we are powerless to do anything other than\nwhat we actually do. This view may be argued for in various ways: by\nappeal to logical laws and metaphysical necessities; by appeal to the\nexistence and nature of God; by appeal to causal determinism. When\nargued for in the first way, it is commonly called \u201cLogical\nfatalism\u201d (or, in some cases, \u201cMetaphysical\nfatalism\u201d); when argued for in the second way, it is commonly\ncalled \u201cTheological fatalism\u201d. When argued for in the\nthird way it is not now commonly referred to as \u201cfatalism\u201d\nat all, and such arguments will not be discussed here. (For useful\nbibliographical information see Todd 2014 [Other Internet Resources].)\n\nThe interest in arguments for fatalism lies at least as much in the\nquestion of how the conclusion may be avoided as in the question of\nwhether it is true.\n",
