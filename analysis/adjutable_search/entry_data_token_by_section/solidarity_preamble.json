    "main_text": "\n\nThe term \u201csolidarity\u201d first becomes prevalent in the\nearly- to late-nineteenth century in France. Since then, it has always\nbeen used to describe a special relationship of unity and mutual\nindebtedness within a group. The term\u2019s origins lie in French\nlegal usage, in which the Roman legal concept of an obligation in\nsolidum\u2014a joint contractual obligation in which each\nsignatory declared himself liable for the debts of all\ntogether\u2014long had a place in the French code civile\n(Blais 2007; Hayward 1959; Wildt 1999). Solidarity expands beyond its\nlegal origins to become a central social and political concept in\nresponse to anxiety about the centrifugal, individualizing forces of\ncommercial and industrial society. What could replace the old social\nties of church, family, and guild, all of which had been weakened by\nmarkets? What might ensure a sense of shared purpose and common good?\nAs an answer to these questions, \u201csolidarity\u201d becomes a\nrallying cry in progressive movements across Europe, including\nsocialism, liberal nationalism, Catholic reformism, and\nSolidarism.\n\nMore recently, there has been a resurgence not only in calls for\nsolidarity but also in theorizing about solidarity. Solidarity has\nbeen invoked with increasing regularity in contemporary social\nmovements (Movement for Black Lives, Occupy, MeToo, climate change\nactivism), law and politics (COVID, EU, constitutions around the\nworld, human rights), and even bioethics. There is a growing\nliterature in sociology, political science, social theory, and social\nand political philosophy on the concept and its value. And yet, the\nidea remains hard to pin down: What is solidarity? And what, if\nanything, makes it valuable? In this entry, we aim to provide an\noverview of this recent debate, focusing on its development in social\nand political philosophy.\n",
