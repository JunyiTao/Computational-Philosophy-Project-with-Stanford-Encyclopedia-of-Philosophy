    "main_text": "Leibniz on matter || The critique of Cartesian corpuscularianism\n2.2 The critique of Cartesian corpuscularianism\n\n\nLeibniz allied himself with Descartes and most later Cartesians in \nopposing material atomism. Nonetheless he was equally concerned to \nrebut the Cartesian account of matter according to which the whole \nessence of matter is extension \u2013 that is, the thesis that \nmatter is something like geometrical extension made concrete. \nAlthough Leibniz characteristically offers a wide range of arguments \nagainst the Cartesian identification of matter with extension, it \nwill serve our purposes to focus on three especially \nimportant arguments all rooted in the guiding idea that the notion of\nextension is simply too impoverished to provide an intelligible \nfoundation for physics. \n\n\nThe first of these arguments presses on the relationship between the \nnature of matter and the laws of motion. Leibniz, in effect, argues \nthat the thesis that the whole essence of matter is extension saddles\nCartesians with a dilemma: they must either hold that the laws of \nmotion are grounded in the nature of extension, or that God acts \ndirectly to bring about the lawful regularities that are observed in \nthe world. Leibniz maintains that the first horn is inconsistent with\nthe true laws of motion, while the second horn leads to the untenable\npostulation of perpetual miracles. In order to better appreciate \nLeibniz\u2019s line of reasoning here, it is worth unpacking a \nlittle his thinking with respect to each horn of the dilemma. \n\n\nBehind Leibniz\u2019s rejection of the first horn lies the assumption that\nif bodies were nothing but matter, and matter nothing but extension, \nthen bodies would be wholly and essentially passive. But if bodies \nwere wholly and essentially passive, Leibniz reasons, they would \nnecessarily be entirely indifferent to motion, and consequently they \nwould obey radically different laws of motion than the ones we \nactually observe: \n\n\nIf there were nothing in bodies but extended mass and nothing in \nmotion but change of place and if everything should and could be \ndeduced solely from these definitions by geometrical necessity, it \nwould follow \u2026 that upon contact the smallest body would \nimpart its own speed to the largest body without losing any of this \nspeed; and we would have to accept a number of such rules which are \ncompletely contrary to the formation of a system. (DM 21/AG 53\u201354)\n\n\nThere is, of course, some irony in Leibniz\u2019s argument here. For, as \nwe noted above, in his early theory of motion Leibniz himself held \nthat bodies offer no resistance to being moved, and thus that it \nwould take no more effort to budge a boulder than a bobby pin. In his\nlater works, however, Leibniz rejects the ideal laws of motion that \nhe had espoused in the TMA, while nonetheless continuing to hold that\nif matter were indifferent to motion, then the laws\nof his abstract theory of motion would hold. Leibniz thus concludes \nthat since his early laws of motion do not govern actual bodies, \nbodies must not be indifferent to motion, and thus must not be \n\u2013 as Descartes had maintained \u2013 simply bits of \ngeometrical extension made real. \n\n\nAll of this, of course, might seem to simply put greater pressure on \nthe second horn of Leibniz\u2019s dilemma. For it might seem that it is \nopen to Descartes\u2019s defenders to maintain that the laws of motion are\nthe result of God\u2019s direct decree, and that consequently they do not \n\u2013 as Leibniz seems to assume \u2013 follow from the nature of \nbody as such. (Indeed, Descartes himself implies that the laws of \nmotion follow inexorably not from the nature of matter, but rather \nfrom the nature of God (AT VIIIA 61\u201362/CSM 1:240).) For Leibniz, \nhowever, such a view is equivalent to conceding that the laws of \nnature hold by dint of divine miracle since \u201cproperly speaking,\nGod performs a miracle when he does something that surpasses the \nforces he has given to creatures and conserves in them\u201d (Letter\nto Arnauld, 30 April 1687, G II 93/AG 83). Thus, for Leibniz, a \nmiracle occurs when a creature performs an action that does not flow \nfrom its own natural powers, and so bodies could obey laws of motion \nnot grounded in their own natural powers only through the advent of a\nperpetual miracle. If Leibniz\u2019s understanding of miracles is granted,\nhis second horn is thus much harder to resist than one might have \notherwise supposed. \n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s second argument focuses on the ability of Cartesian physics\nto account for qualitative variety in the world. The thesis that the \nwhole essence of matter is extension blocks Descartes from holding \nthat matter is itself intrinsically diverse as well as from supposing\nthat matter is differentially distributed in empty space. Clearly \nrecognizing the constraints imposed by his reductive account of body,\nDescartes elegantly maintains that all qualitative variety is to be \ngrounded in the motion of bodies, that is, that \u201cAll the \nvariety in matter, all the diversity of its forms, depends on \nmotion\u201d (Principles 2:23/CSM 1:232). Qualitative variety \namongst bodies for Descartes thus appears to be grounded not in the \nintrinsic natures of bodies or their parts, but rather in the way in \nwhich the parts of bodies move relative to one another. To take an \nexample friendly to Descartes, it might be supposed that the \nqualitative differences between a block of ice, a puddle of water, \nand a cloud are to be explained not by appeal to intrinsic \ndifferences in the elements that constitute them, nor by appeal to \nthe density of their elements in space, but rather in terms of the \nrelative speeds holding between those elements. One might thus \nimagine \u2013 incorrectly of course \u2013 that the hardness of \nice depends only on water molecules being at rest with respect to one\nanother, the fluidity of water only on water molecules moving with \nrespect to one another at a moderate speed, and the etherealness of a\ncloud only on water molecules moving with an extreme relative speed. \n\n\nLeibniz\u2019s ingenious attack on this Cartesian model of qualitative \nvariety proceeds in two steps. The first step charges that motion \nalone is unable to account for qualitative variety at an instant: \nsince all qualitative variety in the Cartesian system depends on \nmotion, and there is no motion in an instant, it follows that in a \nCartesian world there could be no qualitative variety at an \n instant.[12]\n The second step of Leibniz\u2019s argument charges that if the world is \nqualitatively homogenous at every instant, then it must be \nqualitatively homogenous over time as well. For if the world is \nqualitatively undifferentiated at each instant, then every instant \nwill be qualitatively identical, and so the world as a whole will not\nundergo any qualitative change as it passes from one instant to the \nnext. To use an anachronistic analogy, the two steps taken together \nimply that a Cartesian world would be like a filmstrip whose every \nframe is blank, and thus whose projection would not only be \nhomogenous at each instant, but through time as well.\n\n\nA third argument, especially important in connection with Leibniz\u2019s \nmore general metaphysics, takes issue with the implication that \nCartesian bodies \u2013 or at least Cartesian matter taken as a \nwhole \u2013 might be on a metaphysical par with created minds. \nAgain, it might be helpful to see Leibniz\u2019s thinking here as \nproceeding in two steps. First, drawing on principles integral to his\nmetaphysics, Leibniz insists that independence and \nunity are marks of true substances. The independence \ncriterion suggests that we can usefully distinguish between created \nsubstances that depend only upon God for their existence, and \nderivative creatures that depend not only upon God but also upon the \nexistence of created substances as well. The unity criterion implies \na distinction between creatures that are true, indivisible unities, \nand creatures that are mere accidental unities, or \n\u201caggregates.\u201d Leibniz maintains that only the former have\na rightful claim to being genuine created substances, since, as he \nfamously puts it in a letter to Arnauld, \u201cwhat is not truly \none being is not truly one being either\u201d (G \nII.97/AG 86).\n\n\nWith his two criteria in hand, Leibniz next argues that the bodies of\nCartesian physics fail to meet the standards for created substances \ntwice over. For on the one hand, every Cartesian body must be \nextended and divisible, and so must be composed of parts. But this, \nLeibniz maintains, is sufficient by itself to show that Cartesian \nbodies are not fundamental created entities: for if every Cartesian \nbody is composed of parts, then by the independence criterion, the \nparts will be more fundamentally real than the wholes which they \ncompose. No body whose essence is simply extension could therefore be\na genuine created substance according to Leibniz. On the other hand, \naccording to Descartes\u2019s physics the only principle available to \nunite bodies \u2013 at least as they are studied by physicists \n\u2013 is motion. But it is clear that Leibniz thinks that the sort \nof unity that might be provided by mere common motion is insufficient\nfor genuine, substantial unity. Even if an army were to always march \nin perfect step, it would still not be a unity per se, and \nthus would not be \u201ctruly one being either\u201d (G II\n76/AG 79). Thus measured either by the standards of the independence \ncriterion or the unity criterion, Cartesian bodies can be shown to be\nnot fully real in the deepest sense available to created beings. In \nthis thought, Leibniz sees not only an important contrast with human \nminds \u2013 which as partless simples are plausibly independent and\nunified \u2013 but also another indication that mechanistic physics \nmust itself rest on a deeper metaphysical reality quite different \nfrom the \u201cmanifest image\u201d with which we are familiar from\neveryday experience. \n",
