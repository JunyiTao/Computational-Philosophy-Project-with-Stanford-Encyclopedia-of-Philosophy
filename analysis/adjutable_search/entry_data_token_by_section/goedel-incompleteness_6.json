    "main_text": "The First Incompleteness Theorem || Arithmetization of the Formal Language\n2.3 Arithmetization of the Formal Language\n\nThe next essential step of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof is to take the\nlanguage of a formal system, which is always precisely defined (this\nis part of being a formal system), and fix a correspondence of a\ncertain kind between the expressions of that language and the system\nof natural numbers\u2014a coding, \u201carithmetization\u201d, or\n\u201cG\u00f6del numbering\u201d, of the language. There are many\npossible ways of accomplishing this, and the details do not really\nmatter (for some more details of one quite standard approach, see the\nsupplementary document\n G\u00f6del Numbering).\n The essential point is that the chosen mapping is effective: it is\nalways possible to pass, purely mechanically, from an expression to\nits code number, and from a number to the corresponding expression.\nToday, when most of us are familiar with computers and the fact that\nso many things can be coded by zeros and ones, the possibility of such\nan arithmetization is hardly surprising.\n\nRoughly, one proceeds as follows: First, the primitive symbols of the\nlanguage are paired with distinct natural numbers, \u201csymbol\nnumbers\u201d. A little number theory then suffices to code\nsequences of numbers by single numbers. Consequently,\nwell-formed formulas, as sequences of primitive symbols, are each\nassigned a unique number. Finally derivations, or proofs, of the\nsystem, being sequences of formulas, are arithmetized, and are also\nassigned specific numbers. Such a code, the \u201cG\u00f6del\nnumber\u201d of a formula \\(A\\), is denoted as\n\\(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner\\), and similarly for\nderivations.\n\nIn this way, syntactical properties, relations and operations are\nreflected in arithmetic: for example, \\(\\textit{neg}(x)\\) is the\narithmetical function that sends the G\u00f6del number of a formula to\nthe G\u00f6del number of its negation; in other words,\n\\(\\textit{neg}(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner) = (\\ulcorner \\neg A\\urcorner)\\);\nsimilarly, \\(\\impl(x, y)\\) is the function which maps the G\u00f6del\nnumbers of a pair of formulas to the G\u00f6del number of the\nimplication of the formulas: \\(\\impl(\\ulcorner A\\urcorner ,\\ulcorner\nB\\urcorner) = \\ulcorner A \\rightarrow B\\urcorner\\); and so on. There\nis an arithmetical formula, call it\n\\(\\textit{Fmla}(x)\\), which is true of \\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) iff\n\\(\\boldsymbol{n}\\) is a G\u00f6del number of a well-formed formula of\nthe system. There is also an arithmetical formula \\(M(x,y,z)\\) which\nis true exactly if one has a valid application of the rule of\ninference modus ponens for some formulas \\(A\\) and \\(B\\)\nwith \\(x = \\ulcorner A\\urcorner\\), \\(y = \\ulcorner A \\rightarrow\nB\\urcorner\\) and \\(z = \\ulcorner B\\urcorner\\); etc. In this way, all\nthe syntactic properties and operations can be simulated at the level\nof numbers, and moreover they are strongly representable in all\ntheories which contain\nQ.\n\nAs it is decidable (by the definition of formal systems) whether a\ngiven sequence of formulas constitutes a proof of a given sentence,\naccording to the rules of the chosen formal system \\(F\\), the binary\nrelation \u201c\\(x\\) is (the G\u00f6del number of) a proof of the\nformula (with the G\u00f6del number) \\(y\\)\u201d can be strongly\nrepresented in all systems containing Q, and thus in \\(F\\) in\nparticular. Let us denote the formula which strongly represents this\nrelation in \\(F\\) itself as \\(\\Prf_F (x, y)\\).  The property of being\nprovable in \\(F\\) can then be defined as \\(\\exists x\\Prf_F (x,\ny)\\). Let us abbreviate this formalized provability predicate\nas \\(\\Prov_F (x)\\).  It follows that\nthe latter is weakly representable (though, it turns out, not\nstrongly):\n\n\\[\nF \\vdash A \\Rightarrow F \\vdash\\Prov_F (\\ulcorner A\\urcorner).\n\\]\n\n\nIt is always possible to choose the provability predicate\n\\(\\Prov_F (x)\\) to be a \\(\\Sigma^{0}_1\\)-formula.\n",
