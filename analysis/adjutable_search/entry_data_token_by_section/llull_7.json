    "main_text": "A universal model to understand reality\n2. A universal model to understand reality\n\nRamon Llull\u2019s philosophy is not easily situated in the context\nof the 13th century. Some authors such as Libera (1991:\n135), conceptualize it as part of a movement whose main objective was\nto \u201cunprofessionalize\u201d\n(d\u00e8professionnalisation) philosophy. While Johnston\n(1996) emphasizes the vernacular character of Llull\u2019s thought,\naimed at promoting popular instruction and not only debates in\nuniversities, Pereira (2012) highlights that the originality of his\nthought lies not in the use of the vernacular, but rather in the way\nin which he presents previously disseminated ideas as newly founded,\nwhat ultimately granted the recognition from his peers. In recent\nyears it has been emphasized that Llull is a lay thinker (Dominguez\n2016: 408) who is part of a wide movement of lay people engaged in\nfaith, such as the Beguins (Ensenyat 2017:37) with whom he has\nimportant similarities regarding how to live according to faith.\n\nHowever, the general consensus is that his philosophy is separated\nfrom the novelties proposed by scholasticism and Aristotelianism. His\nthought is based on the widely spread ideas of philosophers such as\nSaint Augustine, Dionysius the Areopagite, Saint Anselm, Hugh of Saint\nVictor, and Saint Bonaventure.\n\nBut the main feature of Llull\u2019s philosophy is its unifying\ncharacter. It suggests that philosophy, theology, and mysticism are\nnot separate or contradictory sources of truth. Rather, they are\ndifferent aspects of the same process of knowledge. He believes also\nin the unity of Christianity. A unit threatened by the infidels and\nthe schism. His entire philosophical program, says Trias Mercant\n(1989), is aimed at turning the infidels of the truth of faith and\nunifying Christians into a dogmatically coherent and morally virtuous\ncommunity.  \n\nWith this purpose in mind, Llull aims to conceive a universal model to\nunderstand reality. As Bordoy (2012) points out, on the one hand, this\nmodel would allow us to know God in his existence and action, and on\nthe other hand, it would acknowledge the rest of creation as generated\nby the divinity. These ideas would allow the writing of the\nArs, a book that would serve as a method to reach truth for\nany Jewish, Catholic, or Muslim scholar. Its ultimate purpose, as\nRubio (2008a) argues, would be to convert infidels through the\nnecessary reasons stated throughout the text and for Christians, as\nTrias Mercant (1989) points out, to know and practice the principles\nof faith. \n",
