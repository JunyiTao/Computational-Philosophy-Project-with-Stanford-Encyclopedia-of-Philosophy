    "main_text": "Discrete geometries as direct analogs\n2. Discrete geometries as direct analogs\n\nThe first question to settle is what the classical theory will be. As\nmost of the work that has been done has been limited to the plane,\nthis presentation will also be restricted to that particular case (in\nmost proposals the extension to higher dimensional geometries is\nconsidered to be completely straightforward). But that is not\nsufficient, for there are different routes to follow as to the\npresentation of plane geometry. One possibility is to take any\naxiomatisation of the (Euclidean) plane\u2014say, Hilbert\u2019s\nformulation of 1899 in his Grundlagen der Geometrie\u2014and\nshow what changes are required to have (a) finite models of the\naxiomatic theory, and (b) finite models that approximate the classical\n(infinite, Euclidean) models as closely as possible. One of the very\nfirst attempts dates back to the late 40s, early 50s and will\ntherefore be presented here as an exemplar (in the sense that it has\nboth all the positive qualities required as well as the oddities that\nseem to go together with such attempts). More specifically, it\nconcerns the work of Paul Kustaanheimo in partial collaboration with\nG. J\u00e4rnefelt in the period between 1949 and 1957. Next a proposal\nwill be discussed, along totally different lines, of Patrick Suppes,\ntogether with a more recent similar approach by John Burke. Then\nfollows a somewhat older proposal of Ludwik Silberstein, where the\ngeometry is directly imbedded in a physical theory, special relativity\ntheory to be precise. The concluding section of this part deals with\nsome specific problems and tentative solutions.\n",
