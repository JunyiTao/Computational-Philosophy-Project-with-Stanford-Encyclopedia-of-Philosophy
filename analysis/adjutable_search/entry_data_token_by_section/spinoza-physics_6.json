Bodies as modes of substance and as individuals.\n\nAs noted above, Spinoza accepts the basic Cartesian view that physical\nthings are res extensa\u2014extended things. However,\nwhereas Descartes held that distinct bodies are distinct extended\nsubstances, Spinoza famously holds that there is but one\nsubstance\u2014God or nature\u2014and that distinct bodies are\nmerely modes of this one substance, considered as extended. Spinoza's\nsubstance monism is in part motivated by inadequacies in the Cartesian\nview. Descartes officially defines substance in terms of independence:\na substance is that whose existence depends upon no other thing. But\nonly God satisfies this definition, all other beings depending on God\nfor their existence. So Descartes also allows for finite\nsubstances\u2014minds and bodies\u2014that are dependent only upon\nGod. But it is only in an equivocal sense that both God and created,\nfinite bodies and minds are substances. Spinoza will have none of\nthis. For him, independence is the sine qua non of substance,\nand nothing that is not its own cause \u2014 nothing whose existence\nis not of its essence\u2014is independent. Hence nothing finite and\ncreated is substantial. Further, since everything is either in itself\nor in another (Ia1), finite things like bodies are in substance, that\nis, they are in some way features of the one substance.\n\nThis denial of substantiality to bodies gives rise to an important\ninterpretive issue. The traditional concept of a substance has at\nleast two important strands. One is the idea we have already seen, of\nsubstance as independent. Spinoza clearly means his\n\u2018demotion\u2019 of bodies to modal status to be a denial that\nthey are substances in this sense. But another is the idea of a\nsubstance as an ultimate subject of predication, that is, as something\nof which properties or relations may be predicated, but which is\nitself never predicated of anything else. Does Spinoza mean to deny to\nbodies and other finite things this status as an ultimate subject as\nwell? That is, is talk of bodies fundamentally to be construed for\nSpinoza as predicative or adjectival on substance? Or do bodies,\nthough they are not substances, nonetheless lie on the subject side of\nthe subject/predicate divide, themselves bearers of properties, but\nnot strictly properties of anything else? This matter is of the utmost\nimportance for the understanding of Spinoza's physical theory, since\ndeciding that Spinoza held bodies to be in fact ways substance is and\nadjectival on it, in accord with the former interpretation, requires\nthat bodies as ordinarily conceived must be thought of as arising from\nand reducible to some more fundamental qualitative variation in\nspatiotemporal regions of extension. This has the consequence, to some\ncommentators salutary, of rendering Spinoza physical theory strongly\nprescient of contemporary physical views, in which ultimately physical\nnature is conceived as a field of gradient forces, bodies being not\nultimate, but rather the consequences of particular local\nconcentrations of certain classes of those forces, yielding certain\ncharacteristic effects in interactions, which effects we take as\nmarking the presence of bodies.\n\nIn favor of the adjectival reading (promoted by Bennett 1984) is\nSpinoza's use of the term \u201cmodus\u201d, or \u201cmode\u201d,\nin connection with bodies; this term regularly signifies a way\nsomething is, or a feature it has, functioning to group what are\nclearly predicates of things, and in Cartesian usage it means both\nthis and a dependent being. Against the adjectival reading, and in\nfavor of the view (promoted by Curley 1988) that Spinozistic bodies\nand minds are ultimate subjects of predication, is Spinoza's\npersistent references to bodies as individuals and as \n things.[5]\n\nThe\nadjectival view of bodies, unlike the subjectival, must therefore face\nthe difficult general question how individuals or things can be\npredicated of other individuals or things. However, the question of\nhow bodies are individuated\u2014the principles according to which\nthey are distinguished from one another and maintain identity through\ntime and change\u2014presents especially interesting and thorny\ndifficulties for both the adjectival and subjectival views of\nbodies.\n",
