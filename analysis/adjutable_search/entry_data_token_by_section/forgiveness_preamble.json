    "main_text": "\n\nTo forgive is to respond in a particular way to someone who has\ntreated someone badly or wrongly. Forgiveness is therefore a dyadic\nrelation involving a wrongdoer and a wronged party, and is thought to\nbe a way in which victims of wrongdoing alter both their and a\nwrongdoer\u2019s status by, for instance, acknowledging yet moving\npast a moral transgression. Commonly, forgiveness is thought to\ninvolve the giving up of certain negative emotions towards the\nwrongdoer, the forbearance of negative reactions against the\nwrongdoer, and possibly the restoration of the relationship with the\nwrongdoer. Much philosophical discussion of forgiveness centers on\nthree primary questions: (1) What is the nature of\nforgiveness\u2014what must one do in order to forgive; (2) Who has\nstanding to forgive\u2014when is one in a position to forgive a\nwrongdoer; and (3) What are the norms governing forgiveness\u2014when\nis forgiveness morally good, right, or praiseworthy?\n",
