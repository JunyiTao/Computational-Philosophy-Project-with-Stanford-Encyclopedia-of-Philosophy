    "main_text": "What is Digital Art? || The Analog-Digital Distinction\n1.2 The Analog-Digital Distinction\n\nThe classical account of the analog-digital distinction is found in\nNelson Goodman\u2019s Languages of Art (1976). In fact\nGoodman\u2019s account remains practically the only general\naccount of the distinction. While David Lewis (1971) raises a series\nof objections to Goodman, Lewis\u2019 alternative account applies\nonly to the representation of numbers. And while John Haugeland (1981)\nreturns to the general distinction, he effectively qualifies and\nre-frames Goodman\u2019s account in order to overcome Lewis\u2019s\nand other potential objections. A few philosophers interested in\nclarifying the concepts employed by cognitive scientists have\nrecognized the need for a general account of the analog-digital\ndistinction (e.g., Dretske 1981; Blachowicz 1997; Katz 2008; Maley\n2011). But in this context, as well, Goodman\u2019s account is the\nessential point of reference. In some ways, this is surprising or at\nleast striking: As Haugeland points out, the digital is a\n\u201cmundane engineering notion\u201d (1981: 217). Yet the\nphilosophical context in which the notion receives its fullest\nanalysis is that of aesthetics. As is well-known, Goodman\u2019s\ninterests in this context center on the role of musical notation in\nfixing the identity of musical works. But a musical notation is also a\nstandard example of a digital system.\n\nOn Goodman\u2019s broad, structuralist way of thinking,\nrepresentational systems in general consist of sets of possible\nphysical objects that count as token representations. Objects are\ngrouped under syntactic and semantic types, and interesting\ndifferences between kinds of representational system track differences\nin the way syntactic and semantic types relate to one another. Digital\nsystems are distinguished by being differentiated as opposed\nto dense. The condition of syntactic differentiation\nis met when the differences between classes of token representations\nare limited such that it is possible for users of the system always to\ntell that a token belongs to at most one class. The condition of\nsemantic differentiation is met when the extension of each\ntype, or the class of referents corresponding to a class of token\nrepresentations, differs in limited ways from the extension of any\nother type; so that users of the system can always tell that a\nreferent belongs to at most one extension. Goodman provides the\nfollowing example of a simple digital computer, a system that meets\nthe conditions of both syntactic and semantic differentiation: Say we\nhave an instrument reporting on the number of dimes dropped into a toy\nbank with a capacity for holding 50 dimes, where the count is reported\nby an Arabic numeral on a small display (Goodman 1976: 159). In this\nsystem, the syntactic types are just the numbers 0\u201350, which\nhave as their instances the discrete displays, at different times, of\nthe corresponding Arabic numerals. Both the conditions of syntactic\nand semantic differentiation are met because the relevant differences\nbetween instances of different numbers are both highly circumscribed\nand conspicuous. This means that users of the system can be expected\nto be able to read the display, or determine which number is\ninstantiated on the display (syntactic differentiation) and which\nnumerical value, or how many coins, is thereby being indicated\n(semantic differentiation).\n\nAnalog representation fails to be differentiated because it is dense.\nWith an ordering of types such that between any two types, there is a\nthird, it is impossible to determine instantiation of at most one\ntype. Not every case involving a failure of finite differentiation is\na case of density but, in practice, most are. With a traditional\nthermometer, for example, heights of mercury that differ to any degree\ncount as distinct syntactic types and the kinds of things that can\ndiffer semantically. Similarly, for pictures distinguished according\nto regions of color, for any two pictures, no matter how closely\nsimilar, one can always find a third more similar to each of them than\nthey are to each other. Density is a feature of any system that\nmeasures continuously varying values. That is, as long as the system\nin question is designed so that any difference in magnitude indicates\na difference in type.\n\nReturning to the digital, some commentators have questioned whether\nGoodman\u2019s condition of (syntactic and semantic) finite\ndifferentiation is sufficient to distinguish the kind of\nrepresentation in question (Haugeland 1981; Lewis 1971). John\nHaugeland, for example, argues that there can be differentiated\nschemes without the \u201ccopyability\u201d feature that defines the\npractical significance of digital systems. Haugeland\u2019s solution\nis to require the practical and not just the theoretical possibility\nof a system\u2019s users determining type membership. In fact,\nhowever, Goodman himself would likely accept this modification. In a\nlater work, Goodman explicitly states that finite differentiation must\nmake it possible to determine type membership \u201cby means\navailable and appropriate to the given user of the given scheme\u201d\n(Goodman and Elgin 1988: 125).\n",
