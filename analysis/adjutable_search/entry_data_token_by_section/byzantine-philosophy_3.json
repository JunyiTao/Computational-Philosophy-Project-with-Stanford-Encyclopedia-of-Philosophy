    "main_text": "Topics || The Immortality of the Soul\n2.1 The Immortality of the Soul\n\n\nThe question of the immortality of the soul is a potential point of\nconflict between Orthodox Christian doctrine and Byzantine natural\nphilosophy. Byzantine natural philosophy, like its late antique\npredecessor, was largely based on the works of Aristotle. In Book 2 of\nthe De anima, Aristotle defines the soul as \u201cthe first\nactuality of a natural body which potentially has life.\u201d He\nhimself draws the conclusion that the soul must be inseparable from the\nbody. It seems clear, too, that on this view the soul cannot survive\nthe moment of the body\u2019s death. Still, Aristotle leaves open the\npossibility that there may be some part of the soul that is not the\nactuality of a body, and therefore may be separable. As he explains in\nBook 3 of the De anima, the mental faculty by which we think\nand form beliefs, nous, variously translated as\n\u201cmind\u201d or \u201cintellect\u201d, in fact lacks a bodily\norgan. In one of the most intriguing and hotly debated passages of\nancient philosophy, De anima Book 3, chapter 5, Aristotle\nintroduces the notion of a kind of intellect that he describes as\nproductive and active, and this kind of intellect, according to him, is\nnot only separable from the body but is \u201calone immortal and\neternal.\u201d The question, then, is whether the eternal life of this\nproductive and active intellect is enough to ensure survival after\ndeath for the individual human soul.\n\n\nAristotle\u2019s definition of the soul presented a formidable\nchallenge to Byzantine Christians and late antique pagan philosophers\nalike. As Theodore Metochites explained in his S\u0113mei\u014dseis\ngn\u014dmikai (3.6\u20137),\n\n\nthose who have commented upon Aristotle\u2019s writings are even\nunable to conclude from them whether the man thinks that the soul is\nimmortal or not. Some of them are of the opinion that he does not allow\nany possibility for the soul to exist without the body, and they easily\nconvince the multitude that this is so. They refer to those texts in\nwhich Aristotle defines the soul as dependent on the body, ruling that\nit is \u201cthe actuality of an organic body by nature endowed with\nlife,\u201d without distinguishing any unique and incorporeal part of\nit, and consequently also thinking that it is destined to pass away\nwith the body. Others have the opposite view.\n\n\n\n\nAmong the ancient authors who held the view that Aristotle denied\nany kind of immortality for the individual human soul we find Alexander\nof Aphrodisias, who famously identified the productive intellect of\nDe anima 3.5 with the first mover. Christian authors such as\nHippolytus of Rome, Tatian, Ps.-Justin Martyr, Gregory of Nyssa, and\nTheodoret also claimed that Aristotle believed the soul to be wholly\nmortal, and they all condemned him for it. Perhaps it is not so\nsurprising that the fiercely anti-Aristotelian 2nd-century Platonist\nAtticus did the same; but Aristotle\u2019s definition was also\ncriticized by Plotinus and Porphyry, since it seemed to suggest that\nthe soul was not a separable substance.\n\n\nOne may presume that Metochites\u2019 attribution of this view to\n\u201cthe multitude\u201d expresses contempt. In fact he seems to\nhave sided with \u201cthe opposite view\u201d, namely,\n\n\nthat [Aristotle] does in fact define soul as immortal and assign to\nit a unique and incorporeal mode of being. [Those who hold this view] refer\nto those texts in which he considers intellect as functioning\nseparately and possessing an activity which does not require the body;\nand [they say that] both in the De anima and especially in\nPhysics 7\u20138 he compares the intellect in the body to the\npilot of a ship: on the one hand it governs the body, but on the other\nit is carried along with it, although it still has a separate being and\nis destined to abandon the body but not itself.\n\n\n\n\nThis was the standard view. Among those who maintained that\nAristotle did assign immortality to at least some part of the\nindividual soul are all the late antique commentators whose\ncommentaries on the De anima are extant.\n\n\nOf the Neoplatonists, John Philoponus, whose commentary was highly\ninfluential throughout the Greek Middle Ages though virtually unknown\nin the Latin West, held that Aristotle agreed with Plato that of the\nthree kinds of soul (1) the vegetative soul alone is wholly\ninseparable from the body; (2) the irrational soul (comprising the\nfaculties of imagination and sense-perception as well as appetite and\ndesire) is separable from the gross body, though inseparable from\nthe pneuma, and thus mortal; and (3) the rational soul, the\nsubstance of which transcends all body, but some of whose activities\nare bound up with the human body (as those of the pilot are bound up\nwith the ship), is wholly separable and thus immortal. It seems clear\nthat \u201crational soul\u201d in this context is synonymous with\n\u201cintellect\u201d in the Aristotelian texts. Ps.-Simplicius (=\n?Priscian) takes a similar view, but in Ps.-Philoponus\u2019 (=\n?Stephanus\u2019) commentary, the scheme is altered so as to allow\nimmortality even to the two perishable kinds of soul (\u201cfor they\nperish not in their capacity of soul but in their capacity of being in\na body\u201d). Thus Plato\u2019s dictum that \u201call soul is\nimmortal\u201d (Phdr. 245c6) according to Ps.-Philoponus\nholds true, even though intellect is the only part of soul which is\nimmortal and eternal, as Aristotle says. The interpretation\nof Phaedrus 245c6 as referring to \u201cboth rational,\nirrational and vegetative\u201d soul is ascribed to Numenius (f. 47)\nand repudiated by Philoponus (In DA 9.35\u201310.1). What\nall the Neoplatonic commentators took for granted is that the\nproductive intellect introduced in De anima 3.5 is part of\nthe individual human soul. This must be so, since in their view\nthe De anima is a treatise on the human soul.\n\n\nThe interpretative tradition of the Neoplatonic commentators\nstretches well beyond the 11th century, when John Italos defended what\nhe took to be Aristotle\u2019s position, namely that rational\nsoul alone is immortal, against Ps.-Philoponus\u2019 interpretation of\nthe above-mentioned Platonic dictum (quaestiones nos. 36;\n50). This is also what Sophonias argued at the turn of the\n14th century in his paraphrase of De anima 3.2. Thus both he\nand Italos conformed to the same scheme as Philoponus and\nPs.-Simplicius. In the same vein, Nikephoros Blemmydes, in his De\nanima (c. 1263), made extensive use of the analogy of the pilot of\na ship as interpreted by the Neoplatonists. First he used\nit to show that Aristotle thought the rational soul was separable and\nimmortal; then he developed it into an image of the turmoil experienced\nby the rational soul as long as it is connected with the body. And in\nthe early 12th century, Michael of Ephesus pointed out, when commenting\non Aristotle\u2019s dictum that the activity of the better part of us\nis more serious, that the intellect which is part of us comes into its\nown only after being separated from the body, which shows, he says,\n\u201cthat those who claim that Aristotle was of the opinion that the\nsoul is mortal were fundamentally wrong\u201d (In NE 10,\n576.25\u201333).\n\n\nHaving thus briefly summarized the arguments both of those who claim\nthat Aristotle did not believe in the immortality of the soul and of\nthose who maintain that he did, Metochites adds an observation of his\nown in support of the latter\u2019s view:\n\n\nAnd the fact is that he himself says the same thing as them in these\nvery books, where he shows (following Plato, although he tries to\nconceal this) that there is one part of the self-moved thing that can\nonly be moved but not cause movement, and another part which can only\ncause movement but not per se be moved, although it can be\nmoved per accidens (namely, when it is moved along with the\nthing that it itself moves). From this it will follow, then, that what\nis moved by something else will also cease to be so; whereas what moves\nitself will consequently not cease to do so, and will not abandon\nitself (its essence being exactly to move itself); since it can under\nno circumstances abandon itself, it is also clear that it is part of\nits essence to exist forever and not cease from its movement, i.e. from\nits very essence and life.\n\n\n\n\nIn this passage Metochites seems to contend that Aristotle\u2019s\nargument against self-movement in Physics 7.1 and 8.5 entails\nthe proposition that \u201cwhat moves itself will not cease to do\nso,\u201d which is used as one of the premises of an argument for the\nimmortality of the soul. This latter argument is apparently strongly\ninspired by the first part of the proof of immortality in\nSocrates\u2019 palinode in Plato\u2019s Phaedrus\n(245c5\u20138). It seems to be an \u201contological\u201d kind of\nargument. That is to say, it attempts to show that the (eternal)\nexistence of the soul follows from its nature. The soul\u2019s nature\nis defined precisely as its movement, whereby it moves itself. The idea\nis obviously that since the mover and the moved thing, if they are\nidentical, cannot be disconnected, there will always be sufficient\nreason that the moved thing is moved (because there will always be a\nmover connected with it) and that the mover causes movement (because\nthere will always be something there for it to move). Now, what seems\nto be the other premise of this argument, namely the proposition that\nthe soul moves itself, is refuted by Aristotle in De anima\n1.3\u20134 on the strength of the very proposition established in\nPhysics 7.1 and 8.5 and cited by Metochites in the preceding\nparagraph, namely that movement is necessarily an irreflexive relation.\nThe question is, then: what reason, if any, can Metochites have for\nthinking that the proposition that self-movement is eternal follows\nfrom (an argument containing) the proposition that self-movement does\nnot exist?\n\n\nIt may be noted that Metochites deduces this proposition in two\nsteps. First he says that it follows from Aristotle\u2019s\nview\u2014namely, (A) that movement is an asymmetrical relation\nbetween two contiguous entities, one of which causes movement and one\nof which is moved\u2014(1) that for any movement, if the moving and\nthe moved parts are disconnected, the movement will cease. Then he adds\nthe further inference (2) that if the moving and the moved parts are\nidentical, the moving part will not cease to cause movement. Since (2)\nclearly does not follow either from (A) or from (1), but does seem to\nfollow from the converse of (1)\u2014that for any movement,\nonly if the moving and the moved parts are disconnected, the\nmovement will cease\u2014one may wonder whether Metochites may have\nfallen prey to the fallacia consequentis: if (if p\nthen q) then (if not-p then not-q).\n\n\nEven if we cannot definitively clear him of this charge, we may be\nable to point to extenuating circumstances. The Neoplatonic\ncommentators, too, espouse the ontological argument for the immortality\nof the soul. They also accept Aristotle\u2019s analysis of movement as\nnecessarily an irreflexive relation; they believe, however, that\n\u201cmovement\u201d in this context refers exclusively to physical\nmovement, and thus that the analysis does not concern the self-movement\nof the soul. That is to say, they affirm the compatibility of the\npremises of the ontological argument with Aristotle\u2019s analysis of\nmovement. They do not try to deduce the former from the latter. That is\nwhy it is interesting to find in Proclus\u2019 Elements of\nTheology (14, 16.15\u201323) an attempt to deduce the existence\nof a self-moved soul \u00e0 la Plato from that of an unmoved\nintellect \u00e0 la Aristotle. It is not clear that it is a\nsuccessful attempt; but it may still have predisposed some of\nProclus\u2019 readers to understand Aristotle\u2019s cosmological\nargument in Physics 8.5 as a proof of the existence of both an\nunmoved mover and (by implication) a self-moved soul. At any rate, if\nthis is how Metochites understood it, his suggestion that the premises\nof the ontological argument for the immortality of the soul are implied\nby Aristotle\u2019s analysis of movement may seem less\nfar-fetched.\n",
