    "main_text": "Epistemology\n2. Epistemology\n\nGiven the abstractness and complexity of financial assets and\nrelations, as outlined above, it is easy to see the epistemic\nchallenges they raise. For example, what is a proper basis for forming\njustified beliefs about matters of money and finance?\n\nA central concept here is that of risk. Since financial assets are\nessentially promises of future money payments, a main challenge for\nfinancial agents is to develop rational expectations or hypotheses\nabout relevant future outcomes. The two main factors in this regard\nare (1) expected return on the asset, which is typically calculated as\nthe value of all possible outcomes weighted by their probability of\noccurrence, and (2) financial risk, which is typically calculated as\nthe level of variation in these returns. The concept of financial risk\nis especially interesting from a philosophical viewpoint since it\nrepresents the financial industry\u2019s response to epistemic\nuncertainty. It is often argued that the financial system is designed\nexactly to address or minimize financial risks\u2014for example,\nfinancial intermediation and markets allow investors to spread their\nmoney over several assets with differing risk profiles (Pilbeam 2010,\nShiller 2012). However, many authors have been critical of mainstream\noperationalizations of risk which tend to focus exclusively on\nhistorical price volatility and thereby downplay the risk of\nlarge-scale financial crises (Lanchester 2010, Thamotheram & Ward\n2014).\n\nThis point leads us further to questions about the normativity of\nbelief and knowledge. Research on such topics as the ethics of belief\nand virtue epistemology considers questions about the responsibilities\nthat subjects have in epistemic matters. These include epistemic\nduties concerning the acquisition, storage, and transmission of\ninformation; the evaluation of evidence; and the revision or rejection\nof belief (see also\n ethics of belief).\n In line with a reappraisal of virtue theory in business ethics, it is\nin particular virtue epistemology that has attracted attention from\nscholars working on finance. For example, while most commentators have\nfocused on the moral failings that led to the financial crisis of\n2008, a growing literature examines epistemic failures.\n\nEpistemic failings in finance can be detected both at the level of\nindividuals and collectives (de Bruin 2015). Organizations may develop\ncorporate epistemic virtue along three dimensions: through matching\nepistemic virtues to particular functions (e.g., diversity at the\nboard level); through providing adequate organizational support for\nthe exercise of epistemic virtue (e.g., knowledge management\ntechniques); and by adopting organizational remedies against epistemic\nvice (e.g., rotation policies). Using this three-pronged approach\nhelps to interpret such epistemic failings as the failure of financial\ndue diligence to spot Bernard Madoff\u2019s notorious Ponzi scheme\n(uncovered in the midst of the financial crisis) (de Bruin 2014a,\n2015).\n\nEpistemic virtue is not only relevant for financial agents themselves,\nbut also for other institutions in the financial system. An important\nexample concerns accounting (auditing) firms. Accounting firms\ninvestigate businesses in order to make sure that their accounts\n(annual reports) offer an accurate reflection of the financial\nsituation. While the primary intended beneficiaries of these auditing\nservices are shareholders (and the public at large), accountants are\npaid by the firms they audit. This remuneration system is often said\nto lead to conflicts of interest. While accounting ethics is primarily\nconcerned with codes of ethics and other management tools to minimize\nthese conflicts of interests, an epistemological perspective may help\nto show that the business-auditor relationship should be seen as\ninvolving a joint epistemic agent in which the business provides\nevidence, and the auditor epistemic justification (de Bruin 2013). We\nwill return to issues concerning conflicts of interest below (in\n section 4.2).\n\nEpistemic virtue is also important for an effective governance or\nregulation of financial activities. For example, a salient epistemic\nfailing that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis seems to be the\nway that Credit Rating Agencies rated mortgage-backed securities and\nother structured finance instruments, and with related failures of\nfinancial due diligence, and faulty risk management (Warenski 2008).\nCredit Rating Agencies provide estimates of credit risk of bonds that\ninstitutional investors are legally bound to use in their investment\ndecisions. This may, however, effectively amount to an institutional\nsetup in which investors are forced by law partly to outsource their\nrisk management, which fails to foster epistemic virtue (Booth &\nde Bruin 2021, de Bruin 2017). Beyond this, epistemic failures can\nalso occur among regulators themselves, as well as among relevant\npolicy makers (see further in\n section 5.1).\n\nA related line of work attests to the relevance of epistemic injustice\nto finance. Taking Fricker\u2019s (2009) work as a point of\ndeparture, de Bruin (2021) examines testimonial injustice in financial\nservices, whereas Mussell (2021) focuses on the harms and wrongs of\ntestimonial injustice as they occur in the relationship between\ntrustees and fiduciaries.\n",
