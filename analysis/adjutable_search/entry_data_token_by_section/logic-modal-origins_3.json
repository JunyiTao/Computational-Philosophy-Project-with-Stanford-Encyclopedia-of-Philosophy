The Matrix Method and Some Algebraic Results\n\nIn \u201cPhilosophical Remarks on Many-Valued Systems of\nPropositional Logic\u201d (1930; but \u0141ukasiewicz 1920 is a\npreliminary Polish version of the main ideas of this paper),\n\u0141ukasiewicz says: \n\n\nWhen I recognized the incompatibility of the traditional theorems on\nmodal propositions in 1920, I was occupied with establishing the\nsystem of the ordinary \u201ctwo-valued\u201d propositional calculus\nby means of the matrix method. I satisfied myself at the time that all\ntheses of the ordinary propositional calculus could be proved on the\nassumption that their propositional variables could assume only two\nvalues, \u201c0\u201d or \u201cthe false\u201d, and\n\u201c1\u201d or \u201cthe true\u201d. (1970: 164) \n\n\nThis passage illustrates well how \u0141ukasiewicz was thinking of\nlogic in the early twenties. First, he was thinking in algebraic\nterms, rather than syntactically, concerning himself not so much with\nthe construction of new systems, but with the evaluation of the\nsystems relatively to sets of values. Secondly, he was introducing\nthree-valued matrices to make logical space for the notion of\npropositions (eminently about future contingents) that are neither\ntrue nor false, and that receive the new indeterminate value \u00bd.\nIronically, later work employing his original matrix method will show\nthat the hope of treating modal logic as a three-valued system cannot\nbe realized. See also the SEP entry on\n many-valued logic.\n\nA matrix for a propositional logic L is given by (i) a set\nK of elements, the truth-values, (ii) a non-empty subset\n\\(D\\subseteq K\\) of designated truth-values, and (iii) operations on\nthe set K, that is, functions from \\(n\\)-tuples of truth-values\nto truth-values, that correspond to the connectives of L. A\nmatrix satisfies a formula A under an assignment \\(\\sigma\\) of\nelements of K to the variables of A if the value of\nA under \\(\\sigma\\) is a member of D, that is, a\ndesignated value. A matrix satisfies a formula if it satisfies it\nunder every assignment \\(\\sigma\\). A matrix for a modal logic M\nextends a matrix for a propositional logic by adding a unary function\nthat corresponds to the connective \\(\\Diamond\\).\n\nMatrices are typically used to show the independence of the axioms of\na system as well as their consistency. The consistency of two formulas\nA and B is established by a matrix that, under an\nassignment \\(\\sigma\\), assigns designated values to both formulas. The\nindependence of formula B from formula A is established\nby a matrix that (i) preserves the validity of the rules of the system\nand that (ii) under an interpretation \\(\\sigma\\) assigns a designated value to A\nbut not to B. Parry (1939) uses the matrix\nmethod to show that the number of modalities of Lewis\u2019s systems\nS3 and S4 is finite. A modality is a\nmodal function of one variable that contains only the operators\n\\(\\neg\\) and \\(\\Diamond\\). The degree of a modality is given by the\nnumber of \\(\\Diamond\\) operators contained. A proper modality is of\ndegree higher than zero. Proper modalities can be of four different\nforms:  \n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\tag{1} \\neg \\ldots \\Diamond p\\\\\n\\tag{2} \\Diamond \\ldots \\Diamond p\\\\\n\\tag{3} \\neg \\ldots \\Diamond \\neg p\\\\\n\\tag{4} \\Diamond \\ldots \\neg p.\\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\n\nThe improper modalities are \\(p\\) and \\(\\neg p\\) (1939: 144). Parry\nproves that S3 has 42 distinct modalities, and that\nS4 has 14 distinct modalities. It was already known\nthat system S5 has only 6 distinct modalities since\nit reduces all modalities to modalities of degree zero or one. Parry\nintroduces system S4.5 by adding to\nS4 the following axiom:  \n\n\\[\\mvdash \\neg \\Diamond \\neg \\Diamond \\neg \\Diamond p\\Rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond p.\\]\n\n\nThe system reduces the number of modalities of S4\nfrom 14 to 12 (or 10 proper ones). The addition of the same axiom to\nLewis\u2019s system S3 results in a system with 26\ndistinct modalities. Moreover, if we add  \n\n\\[\\mvdash \\neg \\Diamond \\neg \\Diamond \\Diamond p\\Rightarrow \\neg \\Diamond \\neg \\Diamond p\\]\n\n\nto S3 we obtain a distinct system with 26 modalities\nalso intermediate between S3 and S4.\nTherefore the number of modalities does not uniquely determine a\nsystem. Systems S1 and S2, as well\nas T and B, have an infinite number\nof modalities (Burgess 2009, chapter 3 on Modal Logic, discusses the\nadditional systems S4.2 and S4.3 and\nexplains well the reduction of modalities in different systems).\n\nA characteristic matrix for a system L is a matrix\nthat satisfies all and only the theorems of L. A matrix is\nfinite if its set K of truth-values is finite. A\nfinite characteristic matrix yields a decision procedure, where a\nsystem is decidable if every formula of the system that is not a\ntheorem is falsified by some finite matrix (this is the finite model\nproperty). Yet Dugundji (1940) shows that none of\nS1\u2013S5 has a finite\ncharacteristic matrix. Hence, none of these systems can be viewed as\nan \\(n\\)-valued logic for a finite \\(n\\). Later, Scroggs (1951) will\nprove that every proper extension of S5 that\npreserves detachment for material implication and is closed under\nsubstitution has a finite characteristic matrix.\n\nDespite their lack of a finite characteristic matrix, McKinsey (1941)\nshows that systems S2 and S4 are\ndecidable. To prove these results McKinsey introduces modal matrices\n\\((K, D, -, *, \\times)\\), with \\(-\\), \\(*\\), and \\(\\times\\)\ncorresponding to negation, possibility, and conjunction respectively.\nA matrix is normal if it satisfies the following\nconditions:\n\nif \\(x \\in D\\) and \\((x\\Rightarrow y) \\in D\\) and \\(y \\in K\\),\nthen \\(y \\in D\\),\nif \\(x \\in D\\) and \\(y \\in D\\), then \\(x\\times y \\in D\\),\nif \\(x \\in K\\) and \\(y \\in K\\) and \\(x\\Leftrightarrow y \\in D\\),\nthen \\(x = y\\).\n\n\nThese conditions correspond to Lewis\u2019s rules of strict\ninference, adjunction and substitution of strict equivalents. The\nstructure of McKinsey\u2019s proof is as follows. The proof employs\nthree steps. First, using an unpublished method of Lindenbaum\nexplained to him by Tarski which holds for systems that have the rule\nof Substitution for propositional variables, McKinsey shows that there\nis an S2-characteristic matrix \\(M = (K, D, -, *,\n\\times)\\) that does not satisfy condition (iii) and is therefore\nnon-normal. M is a trivial matrix whose domain is the set of\nformulas of the system, whose designated elements are the theorems of\nthe system, and whose operations are the connectives themselves. The\ntrivial matrix M does not satisfy (iii) given that for some\ndistinct formulas A and B, \\(A\\Leftrightarrow B\\) is an\nS2-theorem. Second, McKinsey shows how to construct\nfrom M a normal, but still infinite,\nS2-characteristic matrix \\(M_1 = (K_1, D_1, -_1, *_1,\n\\times_1 )\\), whose elements are equivalence classes of provably\nequivalent formulas of S2, i.e., of formulas A\nand B such that \\(A\\Leftrightarrow B\\) is a theorem of\nS2, and whose operations are revised accordingly. For\nexample, if \\(E(A)\\) is the set of formulas provably equivalent to\nA and \\(E(A)\\in K_1\\), then \\(-_1 E(A) = E(-A)= E(\\neg A).\nM_1\\) satisfies exactly the formulas satisfied by M without\nviolating condition (iii), hence it is a characteristic normal matrix\nfor S2 (\\(M_1\\) is the Lindenbaum algebra for\nS2). Finally, it is shown that for every formula\nA that is not a theorem of S2 there is a\nfinite and normal matrix (a sub-algebra of \\(M_1)\\) that falsifies it.\nA similar proof is given for S4.\n\nA matrix is a special kind of algebra. An algebra is a matrix without\na set D of designated elements. Boolean algebras correspond to\nmatrices for propositional logic. According to Bull and Segerberg\n(1984: 10) the generalization from matrices to algebras may have had\nthe effect of encouraging the study of these structures independently\nof their connections to logic and modal systems. The set of designated\nelements D in fact facilitates a definition of validity with\nrespect to which the theorems of a system can be evaluated. Without\nsuch a set the most obvious link to logic is severed. A second\ngeneralization to classes of algebras, rather than merely to\nindividual algebras, was also crucial to the mathematical development\nof the subject matter. Tarski is the towering figure in such\ndevelopment.\n\nJ\u00f3nsson and Tarski (1951 and 1952) introduce the general idea\nof Boolean algebras with operators, i.e., extensions of Boolean\nalgebras by addition of operators that correspond to the modal\nconnectives. They prove a general representation theorem for Boolean\nalgebras with operators that extends Stone\u2019s result for Boolean\nalgebras (every Boolean algebra can be represented as a set algebra).\nThis work of J\u00f3nsson and Tarski evolved from Tarski\u2019s\npurely mathematical study of the algebra of relations and includes no\nreference to modal logic or even logic in general. J\u00f3nsson and\nTarski\u2019s theorem is a (more general) algebraic analog of\nKripke\u2019s later semantic completeness results, yet this was not\nrealized for some time. Not only was Tarski unaware of the connection,\nbut it appears that both Kripke and Lemmon had not read the\nJ\u00f3nsson and Tarski papers at the time in which they did their\nmodal work in the late fifties and sixties, and Kripke claims to have\nreached the same result independently.\n\nLemmon (1966a and 1966b) adapts the algebraic methods of McKinsey to\nprove decidability results and representation theorems for various\nmodal systems including T (though apparently in\nignorance of J\u00f3nsson and Tarski\u2019s work). In particular,\nhe extends McKinsey\u2019s method by introducing a new technique for\nconstructing finite algebras of subsets of a Kripke model structure\n(discussed in the next section of this entry). Lemmon (1966b: 191)\nattributes to Dana Scott the main result of his second 1966 paper.\nThis is a general representation theorem proving that algebras for\nmodal systems can be represented as algebras based on the power set of\nthe set K in the corresponding Kripke\u2019s structures. As a\nconsequence, algebraic completeness translates into Kripke\u2019s\nmodel theoretic completeness. So, Lemmon elucidates very clearly the\nconnection between Kripke\u2019s models whose elements are worlds and\nthe corresponding algebras whose elements are sets of worlds that can\nbe thought of as propositions, thereby showing that the algebraic and\nmodel theoretic results are deeply connected. Kripke (1963a) is\nalready explicit on this connection. In The Lemmon Notes\n(1977), written in collaboration with Dana Scott and edited by\nSegerberg, the 1966 technique is transformed into a purely model\ntheoretic method which yields completeness and decidability results\nfor many systems of modal logic in as general a form as possible\n(1977: 29).\n\nSee also the SEP entry on\n the algebra of logic tradition.\n For a basic introduction to the algebra of modal logic, consult\nHughes and Cresswell 1968, Chapter 17 on \u201cBoolean Algebra and\nModal Logic\u201d.
