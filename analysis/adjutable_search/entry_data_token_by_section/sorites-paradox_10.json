The rejection of bivalence\nin the context of the T-schema is said to lead to absurdity\n(Williamson 1994a: ch. 7; see Wright 1994 for criticism). This charge\napplies more generally to any non-bivalent theory of vagueness coupled\nwith the T-schema. If validated, the pressure to abandon bivalence in\nthe presence of vagueness would then cast doubt on a deflationary\naccount of truth. Many will find this consequence untoward. Field\n(2008), for example, is devoted to saving this account of truth from a\nrange of paradoxes and rejects a truth-value gap approach.\n\nSupervaluationists have responded by noting that though the T-schema\nis not true, a corresponding mutual entailment thesis is not\nthreatened: \u201c\u2018p\u2019 is true\u201d entails and is\nentailed by \u2018p\u2019. However, the latter claim is strictly\nweaker than the corresponding claim involving the conditional\naccording to supervaluationism, and one may wonder whether the weaker\ncommitment is sufficient to capture what matters about truth (see\nKeefe 2000: ch. 8). Others have taken issue with the Williamson\nargument by pointing out that in the context of nonbivalent approaches\nto vagueness, negation can be variously defined and that the argument\nsupposes a rejection of bivalence invoking a particularly strong\nreading of negation. In response Williamson contends that while an\nappropriately weak account of negation can be offered sufficient to\nundermine the argument for a general acceptance of bivalence, in the\nspecial case of vagueness the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness\nprovides the materials for similarly reducing this weaker rejection to\nabsurdity. (See Williamson 1994a: 193f. and Pelletier & Stainton\n2003 for further discussion.)\n\nThe claim then is that even if there were a sense in which truth was\nnon-bivalent and nonetheless satisfied the T-schema, thus making\navailable a deflationary account, the particular nature of the problem\nposed by vagueness precludes such a synthesis. The depth of the\nproblem, as evidenced by the phenomenon of higher-order vagueness,\nshows that it cannot be accounted for by a rejection of bivalence\nalone.\n",
