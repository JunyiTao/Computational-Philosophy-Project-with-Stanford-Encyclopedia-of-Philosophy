    "main_text": "Challenges for PIT || Thoughts\n6.1 Thoughts\n\nThoughts are occurrent conceptual states, the kinds of states we have when we think, reflect, or muse over something. Examples of thoughts include\njudgments, occurrent beliefs, and occurrent desires. Thoughts, especially thoughts\nabout abstract ideas such as democracy and the square root function,\nmight seem to lack phenomenal properties. Even if thoughts have\nphenomenal properties, it does not seem that these phenomenal\nproperties are rich or determinate enough to fully account for their\nintentional properties. For example, these phenomenal properties might seem to be\nlimited to verbal and visual imagery. \n\nInflationism is the most widely endorsed strategy for dealing with\noccurrent thoughts, at least in cases of thoughts that do not seem to\nhave wide contents (see\n 6.3 below\n for the latter). Strawson (1994, 2008), Siewert (1998), Horgan &\nTienson (2002), Horgan, Tienson & Graham (2004), and Pitt (2009)\nall hold that occurrent thought has a phenomenology that is rich and\ndeterminate enough to fix its intentional contents. Horgan &\nTienson (2002), Horgan, Tienson & Graham (2004), and Pitt (2009)\nalso argue that the difference between beliefs, desires, and other\nkinds of attitudes is phenomenally constituted. The case for this\napproach rests on the\n arguments for cognitive phenomenology\n we discuss above. \n\nIn contrast, Loar (2003a,b), Bourget (2010, 2015), and Mendelovici (2010, 2018) maintain\nthat thoughts have a fairly impoverished phenomenology that cannot\nfully constitute all the contents we might want to attribute to them.\nLoar (2003a,b) endorses a derived content strategy on which much of\nthought\u2019s content is determined by the \u201clateral\nconnections\u201d between thoughts and other mental states. The\nnetwork of interconnected states eventually derives its content from\nphenomenal intentional states. Bourget (2010) adopts a derived content\nstrategy on which thoughts derive their contents from phenomenal\nintentional states through a variety of derivation mechanisms.\n\nMendelovici (2010, 2018) has a largely eliminativist take on the\nintentionality of thought. Like Pitt (2004, 2009), she holds that all\nintentional states are phenomenal intentional states, but unlike Pitt, she\nmaintains that the phenomenology of thought is too impoverished to\ncapture all the contents we might pre-theoretically want to attribute\nto thoughts. However, she recognizes the existence of derived\nrepresentational contents, which capture the rich contents we tend to\nattribute to thoughts. Derived representational states are not strictly\nspeaking intentional states, but they fill the role that intentional\nstates with rich contents have been thought to play.\n",
