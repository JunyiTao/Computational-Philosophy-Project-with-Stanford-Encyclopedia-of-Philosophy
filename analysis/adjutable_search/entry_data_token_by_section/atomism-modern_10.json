It is possible to understand the\nproject of adapting rational formulae so that they adequately reflect\nchemical properties by interpreting the symbols as representing\ncombining weights or volumes as Berzelius had already observed in his\nearly debates with Dalton. Philosophers and historians of science have\nresponded in a variety of ways to this situation.\n\n\nPierre Duhem (2002), in his classic analysis of the logic of\nnineteenth-century chemistry at the end of that century, construed it\nas being independent of, and offering no support for, atomism. Paul\nNeedham (2004a, 2004b) has recently supported his case. Klein (2003,\n18\u201320) notes that many of the pioneers of the developments in organic\nchemistry referred to combining volumes or portions or proportions\nrather than atoms. She attributes the productivity of the use of\nformulae to the fact that they \u2018conveyed a building-block image\nof chemical proportions without simultaneously requiring an investment\nin atomic theories, together with the simplicity of their\nmaneuverability on paper\u2019 (2003, 35).\n\n\nA number of chemists involved in the early advances of organic\nchemistry who did adopt atomism expressed their ontological commitment\nto \u2018chemical atoms\u2019. In doing so they distinguished their\ntheories from those brands of physical atomism that were in the\ntradition of mechanical or Newtonian atomism and which sought to\nexplain phenomena in general, and chemistry in particular, by\nreference to a few physical properties of atoms. Chemical atoms had\nmore in common with natural minima insofar as they were presupposed to\nhave properties characteristic of the substances they were atoms of.\nChemical atomism lent itself to the idea that it was developments in\nchemistry that were to indicate which properties were to be attributed\nto chemical atoms, as exemplified in the path that led to the property\n\u2018valency\u2019. Alan Rocke (1984, 10\u201315 and 2013) interprets the use of\nformulae in organic chemistry as involving a chemical atomism that is\nweaker than physical atomism but stronger than a commitment only to\nlaws of proportion.\n\n\nDalton's atomism had given a line on just one property of atoms, their\nrelative weight. But it is quite clear that they needed far richer\nproperties to play there presumed role in chemistry. It was to be\ndevelopments in chemistry, and later physics, that were to give\nfurther clues about what properties to ascribe to atoms. (We have seen\nhow chemists came to ascribe the property of valency to them.) There\nwas no viable atomistic theory of chemistry in the nineteenth century\nthat was such that chemical properties could be deduced from it. The\nphenomenon of isomerism is often regarded as a success for\natomism. (See Bird, (1998, p. 152) for a recent example.) There are\nreasons to doubt this. The fact that there are chemical substances\nwith the same proportional weights of the elements but with widely\ndifferent chemical properties was a chemical discovery. It could not\nbe predicted by any atomic theory of the nineteenth-century because no\ntheory contained within its premises a connection between the physical\narrangement of atoms and chemical properties.Isomerism could be\naccommodated to atomism but could not, and did not, predict it.\n\n\nThe emergence of unique atomic weights and the structural formulae\nthat organic chemistry had yielded by the 1860s were to prove vital\ningredients for the case for atomism that could eventually be\nmade. But there are reasons to be wary of the claim that atomism was\nresponsible for the rise of organic chemistry and the extent to which\nthe achievement improved the case for atomism needs to be elaborated\nwith more caution that is typically the case. Glymour (1980, 226\u2013263)\noffers an account of how Dalton's atomism was increasingly confirmed\nand relative atomic weights established by 1860 that conforms to his\n\u2018bootstrapping\u2019 account of confirmation, an account that\nis adopted and built on by Gardner (1979). These accounts do not take\norganic chemistry into account. In one sense, doing so could in fact\nhelp to improve Glymour's account by offering a further element to the\ninterlocking and mutually supporting hypotheses and pieces of evidence\nthat are involved in his case. But in another sense, the fact that\norganic chemistry led to unique formulae by chemical means casts doubt\non Glymour's focus on the establishment of definitive atomic weights\nas the problem for chemistry. There is a case for claiming\nthat correct atomic weights were the outcome of, rather than a\nprecondition for, progress in organic chemistry prior to 1860. After\nall, the majority of the formulae productively involved in that\ndramatic progress were the wrong formulae from a modern point of view!\nFor instance, use of homologous series to project properties of lower\nhydrocarbons on to higher ones are not affected if the number of\ncarbon atoms in the correct formulae are doubled, which results from\ntaking 6 as the relative atomic weight of carbon, as many of the\ncontemporary organic chemists did.\n\nSuggested Readings: Rocke (1984) is a detailed study of the\nrelevant theories in eighteenth-century chemistry whilst Klein (2003)\nis a historical and philosophical analysis of the introduction of\nformulae into organic chemistry. The empirical status of atomism in\nnineteenth-century chemistry is discussed in Chalmers (2009, Chapters\n9 and 10)\n",
