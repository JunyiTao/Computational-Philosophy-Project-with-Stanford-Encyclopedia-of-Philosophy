    "main_text": "Characterizing Presupposition || Introduction\n1.1 Introduction\n\nSpeakers take a lot for granted. That is, they presuppose\ninformation. As we wrote this, we presupposed that readers would\nunderstand English. We also presupposed as we wrote the last sentence,\nrepeated in (1), that there was a time when we wrote it, for otherwise\nthe fronted phrase \u201cas we wrote this\u201d would not have\nidentified a time interval.\n\n(1)\nAs we wrote this, we presupposed that readers would understand\nEnglish.\n\n\nFurther, we presupposed that the sentence was jointly authored, for\notherwise \u201cwe\u201d would not have referred. And we presupposed\nthat readers would be able to identify the reference of\n\u201cthis\u201d, i.e., the article itself. And we presupposed that\nthere would be at least two readers, for otherwise the bare plural\n\u201creaders\u201d would have been inappropriate. And so on.\n\nNote that some of these presuppositions arise by default from specific\nwords that we used. The existence of a time when we wrote the article\nis a requirement associated with our use of \u201cas\u201d. It is a\nrequirement built into the meaning of the temporal preposition\n\u201cas\u201d, which has a similar meaning to temporal \"while\",\nthat in a phrase \u201cas X\u201d, the\n\u201cX\u201d has to hold at some time. We say that\n\u201cas\u201d is a presupposition trigger. Similarly,\n\u201cthis\u201d is a presupposition trigger requiring something\nsalient to refer to, the bare plural is a presupposition trigger\nrequiring existence of multiple individuals, and \u201cwould\u201d\nis a presupposition trigger requiring a salient future or hypothetical\ncircumstance.\n\nIn contrast, some of the presuppositions above have nothing to do with\nthe meanings of any of those words. For example, we can say that the\npresupposition that the addressee speaks English, like the\npresupposition that the addressee is interested in what the speaker\n(or writer) has to say, is a conversational presupposition\nor, following Stalnaker (1972; 1974), speaker presupposition\nor pragmatic presupposition. The presuppositions associated\nwith specific triggers are said to be conventional or\nsemantic. The terminological distinction between semantic and\npragmatic presupposition is of theoretical import: as we will see\nlater, some theorists regard it as an open question whether there are\nany purely conventional presuppositions. A halfway house, suggested\nfor example by Karttunen (1973) and Soames (1982), is to define a\nnotion of utterance presupposition, thus involving a specific\nform that is uttered, but allowing that what is actually presupposed\nmay depend also on the attitudes of the speaker who utters it.\n\nIt is important to note that to call presuppositional expressions\n\u201cconventional\u201d or \u201csemantic\u201d is not\nnecessarily to imply that the presuppositions they trigger don\u2019t\ndepend on the context in any way. For example, although\n\u201cthis\u201d may be viewed as a conventional presupposition\ntrigger, the interpretation very much depends on the context, and the\npresupposition, although typically regarded as conventional, is\nnormally seen precisely as a constraint on the utterance context.\n\nWhat makes presuppositions special? That is, to the extent that\npresuppositions are just a part of the conventional meaning of some\nexpressions, what makes them sufficiently distinctive that they merit\ntheir own entries in handbooks and encyclopedias, as well as many\nhundreds of other articles and book chapters elsewhere? First,\npresuppositions are ubiquitous. And second, there are various respects\nin which the behavior of presuppositions differs sharply from other\naspects of meaning.\n\nAs regards the ubiquity of presuppositions, at least the following\nlexical classes and constructions are widely agreed to be\npresupposition triggers:\n\nfactives (Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970)\n\nBerlusconi knows that he is signing the end of Berlusconism.\n\n\u2192 Berlusconi is signing the end of Berlusconism.\naspectual verbs (\u201cstop, continue\u201d) (Simons,\n2001; Abusch, 2002; Lorenz, 1992)\n\nChina has stopped stockpiling metals.\n\n\u2192 China used to stockpile metals.\ntemporal clauses headed by \u201cbefore\u201d,\n\u201cafter\u201d, \u201csince\u201d, etc. (Beaver and\nCondoravdi, 2003; Hein\u00e4m\u00e4ki, 1974)\n\nThe dude released this video before he went on a killing spree.\n\n\u2192 The dude went on a killing spree.\nmanner adverbs (Abbott, 2000)\n\nJamie ducked quickly behind the wall.\n\n\u2192 Jamie ducked behind the wall.\nsortally restricted predicates of various categories (e.g.,\n\u201cbachelor\u201d) (Thomason, 1972)\n\nJulius is a bachelor.\n\n\u2192 Julius is an adult male.\ncleft sentences (Delin, 1995; Prince, 1986)\n\nIt was Jesus who set me free.\n\n\u2192 Somebody set me free.\nquantifiers (Roberts, 1995; Gawron, 1995; Abusch and\nRooth, 2000; Cooper, 1983)\n\nI have written to every headmaster in Rochdale.\n\n\u2192 There are headmasters in Rochdale.\ndefinite descriptions (Strawson, 1950)\n\nThe Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago stood up and wagged his\nfinger.\n\n\u2192 Trinidad and Tobago have a (unique) prime minister.\nnames (van der Sandt, 1992)\n\nThe author is Julius Seidensticker.\n\n\u2192 Julius Seidensticker exists.\nintonation (e.g., focus, contrast) (Jackendoff, 1972;\nGeurts and van der Sandt, 2004; Roberts, 1998)\n\nHE set me\n free.[1]\n\n\u2192 Somebody set me free.\n\n\nAnd this is only a small sample of the words and syntactic\nconstructions that have been classified as presupposition triggers, so\neven if in some cases there may be doubts about this diagnosis, it can\nhardly be doubted that presupposition triggers abound in everyday\nlanguage. In the following sections we will discuss the behaviors\nwhich mark out presuppositions from ordinary entailments, and then\nintroduce some of the theories that have been developed to account for\nthose behaviors.\n",
