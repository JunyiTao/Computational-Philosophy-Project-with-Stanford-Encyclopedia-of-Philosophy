    "main_text": "Social Choice || Around Utilitarianism\n4.3 Around Utilitarianism\n\nThe theory of social choice with utility functions has greatly\nsystematized our understanding of social welfare functions. For\ninstance, it has shown how to construct a continuum of intermediate\nsocial welfare functions between sum-utilitarianism and the maximin\ncriterion (or its lexicographic refinement, the leximin criterion,\nwhich ranks distributions of well-being by examining first the\nworst-off position, then the position which is just above the\nworst-off, and so on; for instance, the maximin is indifferent between\nthe three distributions (1,2,5), (1,3,5) and (1,3,6), whereas the\nleximin ranks them in increasing order). Three other developments\naround utilitarian social welfare functions are worth mentioning.\n\nThe first development is related to the application of theories of\nequality of opportunity, and involves the construction of mixed social\nwelfare functions which combine utilitarianism and maximin. Suppose\nthat there is a double partition of the population, such that one\nwould like the social welfare function to display infinite inequality\naversion within subgroups of the first partition, and zero inequality\naversion within subgroups of the second partition. For instance,\nsubgroups of the first partition consist of equally deserving\nindividuals, for which one would like to obtain equality of outcomes,\nwhereas subgroups of the second partition consist of individuals who\nhave equal opportunities, so that inequalities among them do not\nmatter. Van de gaer (1993) proposes to apply average utilitarianism\nwithin each subgroup of the second partition, and to apply the maximin\ncriterion to the vector of average utilities obtained in this way. In\nother words, the average utilities measure the value of the\nopportunity sets offered to individuals, and one applies the maximin\ncriterion to such values, in order to equalize the value of\nopportunity sets. Roemer (1998) proposes to apply the maximin\ncriterion within each subgroup of the first partition, and then to\napply average utilitarianism to the vector of minimum utilities\nobtained in this way. In other words, one tries to equalize outcomes\nfor equally deserving individuals first, and then applies a\nutilitarian calculus. These may not be the only possible combinations\nof utilitarianism and maximin, but they are given an axiomatic\njustification which suggests that they are indeed salient, in Ooghe,\nSchokkaert and Van de gaer (2007) and Fleurbaey (2008). For a survey\non the applications of Roemer\u2019s criterion, see Roemer (2002b)\nand, more recently, Ferreira and Peragine (2016), Roemer and Trannoy\n(2016), Ramos and Van de gaer (2016).\n\nA second interesting development deals with intergenerational ethics.\nWith an infinite horizon, it is essentially impossible to combine the\nPareto criterion and anonymity (permuting the utilities of some\ngenerations does not change social welfare) in a fully satisfactory\nway, even when utilities are perfectly comparable. This is a similar\nbut more basic impossibility than Arrow\u2019s theorem. The intuition\nof the problem can be given with the following simple example.\nConsider the following sequence of utilities: (1,2,1,2,\u2026).\nPermute the utility of every odd period with the next one. One then\nobtains (2,1,2,1,\u2026). Then permute the utility of every even\nperiod with the next one. This yields (2,2,1,2,\u2026). This third\nsequence Pareto-dominates the first one, even though it was obtained\nonly through simple permutations. This impossibility is now better\nunderstood, and various results point to the \u201ccatching up\u201d\ncriterion as the most reasonable extension of sum-utilitarianism to\nthe infinite horizon setting. This criterion, which does not rank all\nalternatives, applies when the finite-horizon sums of utilities, for\ntwo infinite sequences of utilities, are ranked in the same way for\nall finite horizons above some finite time. Interestingly, this topic\nhas seen parallel and sometimes independent contributions by\neconomists and philosophers (see e.g. Lauwers and Liedekerke 1997,\nLauwers and Vallentyne 2003, Roemer and Suzumura 2007).\n\nA third development worth mentioning has to do with population ethics.\nSum-utilitarianism appears to be overly populationist, since it\nimplies the \u201crepugnant conclusion\u201d (Parfit 1984) that we\nshould aim for an unhappy but sufficiently large population in\npreference to a small and happy one. Conversely, average\nutilitarianism is \u201cMalthusian\u201d, preferring a happier\npopulation, no matter how small, to a less happy one, no matter how\nlarge. Here again there is an interesting tension, namely, between\naccepting all individuals whose utility is greater than zero,\naccepting equalization of utilities, and avoiding the \u201crepugnant\nconclusion\u201d. This tension is shown in this way. Start with a\ngiven affluent population of any size. Add any number of individuals\nwith positive but almost zero utilities. This does not reduce social\nwelfare. Then equalize utilities, which again does not reduce social\nwelfare. One then obtains, compared to the initial population, a\nlarger population with lower utilities. One sees that these lower\nutilities may be arbitrarily low, if the added individuals are\nsufficiently numerous and have sufficiently low initial utilities,\nthus yielding the repugnant conclusion (see Arrhenius 2000). Average\nutilitarianism disvalues additional individuals whose utility is below\nthe average, which is very restrictive for affluent populations. A\nless restrictive approach is that of critical-level utilitarianism,\nwhich disvalues only individuals whose utility level is below some\nfixed, low but positive threshold. For an extensive overview and a\ndefense of critical-level utilitarianism, see Blackorby, Bossert and\nDonaldson (1997, 2005), as well as Broome (2004). For an original\nproposal relying on a different social welfare function (inspired by\nthe Gini function), see Asheim and Zuber (2014).\n",
