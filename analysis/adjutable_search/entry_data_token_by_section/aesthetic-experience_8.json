    "main_text": "Mental aspects of aesthetic experience || Imagination\n2.3 Imagination\n\nIt\u2019s an old idea (Addison 1712 [1879], Burke 1756 [2007]) that\nimagination is essentially involved in aesthetic experience. But\ndifferent philosophers mean vastly different things by\n\u201cimagination\u201d here.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the imagination was conceived by both\nempiricists and rationalists as one of the few fundamental mental\nfaculties (alongside others like sensation and reason). As such, it\nplayed various different roles in the mental system. One of those\nroles was to take up and combine the raw material offered by sensation\ninto more sophisticated representations available in the absence of\nindividual objects there to be sensed.\n\nAs Kant put it, the imagination \u201csynthesiz[es] the manifold of\nintuition.\u201d In ordinary (non-aesthetic) experience, it does so\naccording to rules or schema provided by the understanding, which\ncorrespond roughly to what we consider concepts today. In an\nexperience of a beautiful object or scene, however, the imagination is\ngiven no such rules, and engages in a \u201charmonious\u201d form of\n\u201cfree play\u201d with the faculty of understanding without\nbringing the object presented in experience under any particular\nconcept whatsoever (see also Section 2.2. above).\n\nAlthough it is hard to say exactly what such \u201cfree play\u201d\nis (cf. Ginsborg 1997, Matherne 2016, K\u00fcplen 2015, Savile 2020),\nthe idea that aesthetic experience crucially involves such free play\nof the imagination has been a vastly influential one (see Guyer 2014\nfor a comprehensive approach to the history of this thought). It is\nclosely allied with the idea of beauty as a form of unity in variety\n(Hutcheson 1726 [2004]), and the idea that we enjoy the activity of\nour own mental faculties in aesthetic experience (see Section 2.1.\nabove). As Benedetto Croce summarized it, it is the idea that\n\u201caesthetic activity fuses impressions into an organic\nwhole\u2026 the synthesis of variety, or multiplicity, into\nunity\u201d (1902 [1992], p. 21). Such play is meant to involve the\nsubject as an agent, and it is meant to be pleasurable in part due to\nthe freedom it gives to the imagination. This is disputable: as the\nnovelist-philosophers Vernon Lee and Clementina Anstruther-Thomson\n(1912) put it, \u201cwe do not take pleasure in playing because\nplaying makes us feel free; but, on the contrary, we get greater and\nmore unmixed pleasure while playing, because we are free to \u2026\naccommodate our activity to our pleasure\u201d (pp. 6\u20137).\n\nThis kind of mental play should be carefully distinguished from other\nforms of play associated with aesthetic experience that also\nconstitutively involve imagination (e.g. Spencer 1855 [1895], Groos\n1896\u20139 [1901]). For example, Walton (1990) has influentially\ntreated our aesthetic engagement with various fictions as a form of\nmake-believe game involving imagination as constrained by certain\nkinds of prescriptions given by the structure of a story or a picture\n(cf. Groos 1898 on a \u201cself-conscious illusion,\u201d pp.\n302\u20133). This is structured, game-like play; Walton intends us to\nunderstand what we do with such aesthetic objects on the model of what\nkids do with toys. It is also often a purely \u2018internal\u2019\nplay, one that doesn\u2019t manifest in further bodily action. But it\nis a form of play undergirded by the imagination not as a synthetic\ncapacity to structure a mess of impressions, but rather undergirded by\nthe imagination as a more general creative capacity, one that allows\nus to entertain vividly things which are not currently present to our\nsenses.\n\nThis now more common conception of the imagination also informs those\notherwise various and disparate views which take aesthetic experience\nto extend beyond what is immediately given in perception. The English\nRomantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1832 [2003]) defined poetry as the\nexpression of imagination, where the imagination is just \u201cmind\nacting upon \u2026 thoughts so as to color them with its own light,\nand composing from them as from elements, other thoughts, each\ncontaining within itself the principle of its own integrity\u201d\n(p.674). Arthur Schopenhauer (1818 [1958]) thought that the\nimagination of the artist was required to go beyond what is literally\nperceived to divine the essences of things:\n\nactual objects are almost always only very imperfect copies of the\nIdea that manifests itself in them. Therefore the man of genius\nrequires imagination, in order to see in things not what nature has\nactually formed, but what she endeavoured to form, yet did not bring\nabout \u2026 (\u00a736 p. 198).\n\n\nDilman Walter Gotshalk wrote in Art and the Social Order\n(1947) that aesthetic experience involves the amplification of what is\ncurrently presented in experience by \u201csuggestions of the\nobject\u201d brought to mind by the imagination (p.19).\n\nRoger Scruton built a theory of aesthetic experience on this creative,\nexpansive power of the imagination in his book Art and\nImagination (1974). A proper experience of art is an imaginative\none, one which \u201cgoes beyond what is strictly given\u201d\n(p.98). The relevant role of imagination here is to make it possible\nfor you to engage in a voluntary, willed form of aspectual seeing, or\n\u201cseeing as,\u201d which makes it possible for you to see a\ncertain shade of blue as sad, for instance, even though it\ncannot literally be sad. Scruton is quick to emphasize that\nthis kind of imagination is not perfectly free, but rather\nconstrained; it \u201cinvolves thinking of these descriptions [e.g.\nof blue as sad] as appropriate in some way to the primary\nobject,\u201d and is subject to certain constraints of rationality\nand objectivity (pp. 98, 55, 112).\n\nA final role key role for the imagination in aesthetic experience of\nart involves recreating something that was originally in the mind of\nthe artist. This is, quite often, a matter of an emotion that is\nexpressed in the artwork (Tolstoy 1897 [2007]; Croce 1912, 1938;\nCollingwood 1938 [1958]; see Section 1.4 above). But it can also be\nmore than that. In The Imaginary (1940 [2004]) and his later\nessay \u201cWhat is Literature?\u201d (1948 [1967]) the French\nexistentialist Jean-Paul Sartre spoke of the imagination as needed to\nconstitute an object for conscious aesthetic contemplation (cf.\nDufrenne 1953). In the case of literature, \u201cthe imagination of\nthe spectator has not only a regulative function but a constitutive\none. It does not play: it is called upon to recompose the beautiful\nobject beyond the traces left by the artist\u201d (1948, p. 33). John\nDewey (1934 [1980]) also claimed, in his theory of\n\u2018esthetic\u2019 and thus particularly unified experience, that\na spectator of art \u201cmust create his own experience. And\nhis creation must include relations comparable to those which the\noriginal producer underwent. \u2026 there must be an ordering of the\nelements of the whole that is in form, although not in details, the\nsame as the process of organization the creator of the work\nconsciously experienced\u201d (p.314).\n",
