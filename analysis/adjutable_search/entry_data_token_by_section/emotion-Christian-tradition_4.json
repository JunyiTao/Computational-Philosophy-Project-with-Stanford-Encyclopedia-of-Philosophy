    "main_text": "Some Christian emotions || Gratitude\n3.1 Gratitude\n\nWe may begin with the emotion that is perhaps closest to\nSchleiermacher\u2019s feeling of absolute dependence, that of gratitude.\nThe grateful person willingly, even gladly, acknowledges his\nindebtedness to \u2014 dependency on \u2014 a benefactor. The\ncentral sentence from the General Thanksgiving in the Book of\nCommon Prayer is,\n\nWe bless thee for our creation, preservation, and all the blessings of\nthis life; but above all, for thine inestimable love in the redemption\nof the world by our Lord Jesus Christ; for the means of grace, and for\nthe hope of glory (p. 19).\n\n\nThe attributes of God that especially come into play in the emotion of\ngratitude are God\u2019s creation and providence for our present life and\nGod\u2019s work of redeeming us from sin in the life, death, and\nresurrection of Jesus Christ. It is true that in this standard\nChristian gratitude the believer does not feel \u201cabsolutely\ndependent\u201d in Schleiermacher\u2019s peculiar sense of that phrase; as\nwe have seen, the feeling of absolute dependence does not allow for\nGod to have any positive attributes. But the believer\ncertainly does feel very dependent on God in the ordinary\nsense of \u2018dependent.\u2019 She construes her own existence as\nhaving not been, had God not willed and worked it. In so feeling, the\nbeliever attributes causality to God as the creator, preserver, and\nredeemer of the believer\u2019s life; and this concept of causality is not\n\u201cborrowed from natural science,\u201d as Otto suggests, but\nantedates natural science by several millennia. It is a concept of\ncausation that is embedded in the Jewish-Christian tradition. (Notice\nthat gratitude, as a construal of what God has done for us,\nalso has the Schleiermacherian property of self-consciousness.) The\nthought of these attributes of God and of God\u2019s relation to the\ngrateful party seems to be more than a Jamesian trigger or stimulus of\nsome physiological perturbation in the body of the believer. It seems\nbetter to think of it as a consideration that \u201cspeaks\u201d to the\nbeliever\u2019s concerns about the good things in her life and about the\nattitude of God toward the believer that those blessings express. No\nmention is made of physiological perturbation, nor does the \u201cfeeling\u201d\nof such figure prominently in the typical believer\u2019s experience. The\nthought seems to be internal to the emotional experience in a way that\nthought cannot be internal to a physiological sensation.\n",
