    "main_text": "Life\n2. Life\n\n\u201cEpicurus, the son of Neocles and Chaerestrata, was an Athenian\nfrom the deme of Gargettus and the lineage of the Phila\u00efdes, as\nMetrodorus says in his On Noble Families. Heraclides, among\nothers, in his epitome of Sotion, says that he was raised in Samos,\nsince the Athenians were given parcels of land there, but came to\nAthens when he was eighteen, when Xenocrates was head of the Academy\nand Aristotle was still in Chalcis\u201d (where he died in 322). So\nbegins the account by Diogenes Laertius (10.1). The dates for\nEpicurus\u2019 birth and first move to Athens are thus 341 B.C.E. and\n323 respectively. Diogenes adds that after the death of Alexander\n(323), when the Athenians were expelled from Samos, Epicurus left\nAthens and joined his father in Colophon (in 321), on the coast of\nwhat is now Turkey. Here he studied philosophy under the tutelage of\nNausiphanes, a Democritean philosopher with skeptical leanings, and\nauthor of a work called the Tripod, on which Epicurus\nreportedly drew for his Canon, his principal work on\nepistemology; in ethics, Nausiphanes substituted the term\nakatapl\u00eaxia (\u201cundauntability\u201d) for\nDemocritus\u2019 athambi\u00ea, \u201cfearlessness,\u201d\nas crucial to the good life, which invites comparison with\nEpicurus\u2019 ataraxia or \u201cimperturbability,\u201d\nthough Epicurus is said to have denied having been influenced by him\n(On Nausiphanes\u2019 role in transmitting elements of Democritean\ndoctrine to Epicurus, see Warren 2002: 160\u201392.)\n\nTen years later, Epicurus moved to Mytilene on the island of Lesbos,\nand soon proceeded to Lampsacus on the nearby mainland; in both cities\nhe taught and gathered followers before returning again to Athens in\n307/06, where he remained until his death in 270, at the age of\nseventy or seventy-one. In Athens, he purchased the property that\nbecame known as the \u201cGarden\u201d (later used as a name for his\nschool itself) and began to develop his own school in earnest.\nDiogenes reports a number of slanderous stories that were circulated\nby Epicurus\u2019 opponents, despite which he affirms that Epicurus\nwas of an extraordinarily humane disposition; this was the prevailing\nview, shared even by hostile witnesses to Epicureanism. Diogenes also\nrecords Epicurus\u2019 will (10.16\u201321), in which, among other\nthings, he made provisions for the children of his friends and\nappointed a successor.\n",
