    "main_text": "Reductionism and Non-Reductionism || Non-Reductionism\n1.2 Non-Reductionism\n\nAccording to Non-Reductionists, Positive Reasons is false, i.e., we\ndon\u2019t need positive reasons for thinking that a speaker\u2019s\ntestimony is reliable in order to be justified in believing what we\nare told. Instead, we have a defeasible but presumptive right to\nbelieve what people tell us. More specifically, Non-Reductionists\nendorse\n\n\nPresumptive Right: A hearer is justified (or\n warranted[5])\n in believing what a speaker says if they do not have an undefeated\ndefeater that indicates that the speaker\u2019s testimony is false or\nunlikely to be true. (Some Non-Reductionists (e.g., Goldberg &\nHenderson 2006) maintain that in addition to simply lacking any\nrelevant undefeated defeaters, the hearer must also be\ncounterfactually sensitive to, or on the lookout for, the\npresence of defeaters in their environment).\n\n\nNon-Reductionism traces at least as far back as Thomas Reid\u2019s\n(IE [1983, 94\u201395])\u2014see Wolterstorff (2001) for more on\nReid\u2019s view. More recently, various versions of Non-Reductionism\nhave been defended by Austin (1946 [1979]), Welbourne (1979, 1981,\n1986, 1994), Evans (1982), A. Ross (1986), Hardwig (1985, 1991), Coady\n(1992, 1994), Burge (1993, 1997, 2013), Plantinga (1993), Stevenson\n(1993), Webb (1993), Dummett (1994), Foley (1994), McDowell (1994),\nStrawson (1994), Williamson (1996, 2000), Millgram (1997), Alvin\nGoldman (1999), Schmitt (1999), Insole (2000), Owens (2000), Rysiew\n(2000), Weiner (2003), Graham (2006a), Sosa (2006), McMyler (2011) and\nBaker and Clark (2018). See also Audi (1997, 1998, 2004, 2006), who\ndefends Non-Reductionism about testimonial knowledge but not about\ntestimonial justification.\n\nOne motivation for Non-Reductionism stems from the desire to avoid the\nproblems associated with the various forms of Reductionism, e.g., if\nhearers are not required to have positive reasons for thinking that\nthe speaker\u2019s testimony is reliable on this occasion,\ntestimonial knowledge will not be too hard to acquire. Another\nmotivation (i.e., Reid IE [1983, 94\u201395]) is rooted in the following\nidea: Whatever reason we have for thinking that perception is a basic\nsource of justification, we have an analogous reason for thinking that\ntestimony is a basic source of justification too. For instance, we can\nrely on a speaker\u2019s testimony unless we have a good reason not\nto because humans are endowed\u2014perhaps by God or just by\nnature\u2014with the disposition to (a) tell the truth (b) believe\nwhat they are told and (c) have some sense of when a speaker is not to\nbe trusted.\n\nHowever, because Non-Reductionists reject Positive Reasons, opponents\nhave objected to the view on the grounds that it permits hearers to be\nirrationally gullible. For instance, recall the case in which you read\na bit of testimony from an anonymous blogger on an arbitrary website\n(i.e., E. Fricker 2002). Or consider this situation: While on your way\nhome from work you see a group of aliens from another planet drop a\nnotebook written in what appears to be English. Upon reading the\nnotebook, you see that the aliens seem to have testified that hungry\ntigers have eaten some of their friends (i.e., Lackey 2008:\n168\u2013169). While these cases are different in certain respects,\nthey are related by the fact that while you do not have any defeaters\nthat indicate that the testimony in question is false or unlikely to\nbe true, you also do not have any positive reasons for accepting what\nthe speaker says. Opponents of Non-Reductionism argue that because it\nwould be irrational for you to accept either of these reports, these\ncases show that Non-Reductionism is false and that in order to be\njustified in believing what a speaker says, you really do need\npositive reasons for thinking that the speaker\u2019s testimony is\nlikely to be true.\n",
