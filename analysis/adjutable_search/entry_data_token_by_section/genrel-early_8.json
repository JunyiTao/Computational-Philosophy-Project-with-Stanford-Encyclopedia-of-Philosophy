    "main_text": "Kantian and Neo-Kantian Interpretations || Rejecting or Refurbishing the Transcendental Aesthetic\n3.3 Rejecting or Refurbishing the Transcendental Aesthetic\n\nIn fact many Kantian philosophers did not attempt to immunize Kant\nfrom an apparent empirical refutation by the general theory. Rather,\ntheir concern was to establish how far-reaching the necessary\nmodifications of Kant must be and whether, on implementation, anything\ndistinctively Kantian remained. Certainly, most at risk appeared to be\nthe claim, in the Transcendental Aesthetic, that all objects of outer\nintuition, and so all physical objects, conform to the space of\nEuclidean geometry. Since the general theory of relativity employed\nnon-Euclidean (Riemannian) geometry for the characterization of\nphysical phenomena, the conclusion seemed inevitable that any\nassertion of the necessarily Euclidean character of physical space in\nfinite, if not infinitesimal, regions, is simply false.\n\nWinternitz (1924), an example of this tendency, may be singled out on\nthe grounds that it was deemed significant enough to be the subject of\na rare book review by Einstein (1924). Winternitz argued that the\nTranscendental Aesthetic is inextricably connected to the claim of the\nnecessarily Euclidean character of physical space and so stood in\ndirect conflict with Einstein\u2019s theory. It must accordingly be\ntotally jettisoned as a confusing and unnecessary appendage of the\nmore fundamental transcendental project of establishing the a\npriori logical presuppositions of physical knowledge. Indeed,\nthese presuppositions have been confirmed by the general theory: They\nare spatiality and temporality as \u201cunintuitive schema of\norder\u201d in general (as distinct from any particular\nchronometrical relations), the law of causality and presupposition of\ncontinuity, the principle of sufficient reason, and the conservation\nlaws. Remarkably, the necessity of each of these principles\nwas, rightly or wrongly, soon to be challenged by the new quantum\nmechanics. (The ill-fated 1924 theory of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater\nattempting to unify the classical electromagnetic field with\ndiscontinuous quantum transitions in atoms is a period challenge to\nthe law of conservation of energy.) According to Winternitz, the\nne plus ultra of transcendental idealism lay in the claim\nthat the world \u201cis not given but posed (nicht gegeben,\nsondern aufgegeben) (as a problem)\u201d out of the given\nmaterial of sensation. Interestingly, Einstein, late in life, returns\nto this formulation as comprising the fundamental Kantian insight into\nthe character of physical knowledge (1949b: 680; Ryckman 2017: chapter\n10).\n\nHowever, a number of neo-Kantian positions, of which that of Marburg\nwas only the best known, did not take the core doctrine of the\nTranscendental Aesthetic \u00e0 la lettre. Rather,\nresources broadly within it were sought for preserving an updated\n\u201ccritical idealism\u201d. In this regard, Bollert (1921) merits\nmention for its technically adroit presentation of both the special\nand the general theory. Bollert argued that relativity theory had\nclarified the Kantian position in the Transcendental Aesthetic by\ndemonstrating that not space and time, but spatiality (determinateness\nin positional ordering) and temporality (in order of succession) are\na priori conditions of physical knowledge. In so doing,\ngeneral relativity theory with its variably curved spacetime, brought\na further advance in the steps or levels of\n\u201cobjectivation\u201d lying at the basis of physics. In this\nprocess, corresponding with the growth of physical knowledge since\nGalileo, each higher level is obtained from the previous through\nelimination of subjective elements from the concept of physical\nobject. This ever-augmented revision of the conditions of objectivity\nalone is central to critical idealism. For this reason, Bollert\nclaimed it is \u201can error\u201d to believe that \u201ca\ncontradiction exists between Kantian a priorism and\nrelativity theory\u201d (1921: 64). As will be seen, these\nconclusions are quite close to those of the much more widely known\nmonograph of Cassirer (1921). It is worth noting, however, that\nBollert\u2019s interpretation of critical idealism was cited\nfavorably later by G\u00f6del (1946/9-B2: 240, n.24) during the course\nof research which led to his famous discovery of rotating universe\nsolutions to Einstein\u2019s gravitational field equations (1949).\nG\u00f6del\u2019s investigation had been prompted by curiosity\nconcerning the similar denials, in relativity theory and in Kant, of\nan absolute time.\n",
