    "main_text": "Sexual Difference || Radical Feminism\n3.1 Radical Feminism\n\nThere are some controversies over exactly what is to be termed radical\nfeminism. As used here the term refers to feminists who stress\nessential or very deep rooted differences between men and women, and\nwho celebrate the distinctive modes of embodiment and experiential\ncapacities that women have. Radical feminists were/ are centrally\ninvolved in highlighting sexual violence against women globally, which\nthey sometimes see as rooted in male nature, or deep processes of\nsocialization. Despite Shulamith Firestone\u2019s (1970 [1979]; Merck\nand Sandford 2010), early visions of liberating women from\nreproductive tasks; within most Anglo-American radical feminism, both\nfemale sexuality and the female capacity to give birth are seen as\ngrounds for affirming the power and the value of the female body.\nFemale sexuality is celebrated for its power and its supposed capacity\nto escape from structures of dominance and submission, (Rich 1979). Women\u2019s maternal bodies are seen as a source of\npositive values to set against male norms, stressing care and\ninter-subjectivity, as opposed to autonomy and duty (Rich 1979,\nRuddick 1989). Women\u2019s engagement with the reproductive process\nis also regarded as anchoring both anti-militarism and a respect for\nthe natural world, which puts them at the forefront of peace and\necological movements (Griffin 1978). Reproduction and their caring\nroles also sets them against the widespread violence of men. These\napproaches are very significant for giving women\u2019s bodies a\npositive value which induces pride rather than shame. However, such\napproaches also suffer from the dangers of homogenizing what are very\nvariable experiences both of sexuality and maternity. As Grimshaw\npoints out, for women childbearing has been seen \u201cboth as the\nsource of \u2026 greatest joy and as the root of their worst\nsuffering\u201d (1986: 73). Moreover woman themselves engage in\nmilitary professions, and can themselves be violent in private and public space. Claims\ncelebrating female embodiment therefore need to heed Beauvoir\u2019s\ninsistence that the experience of embodiment is a product of\nsituation.\n",
