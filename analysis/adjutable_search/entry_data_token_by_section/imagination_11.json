    "main_text": "Roles of Imagination || Mindreading\n3.1 Mindreading\n\nMindreading is the activity of attributing mental states to\noneself and to others, and of predicting and explaining behavior on\nthe basis of those attributions. Discussions of mindreading in the\n1990s were often framed as debates between \u201ctheory\ntheory\u201d\u2014which holds that the attribution of mental states\nto others is guided by the application of some (tacit) folk\npsychological theory\u2014and \u201csimulation\ntheory\u201d\u2014which holds that the attribution of mental states\nis guided by a process of replicating or emulating the target\u2019s\n(apparent) mental states, perhaps through mechanisms involving the\nimagination. (Influential collections of papers on this debate include\nCarruthers & Smith (eds.) 1996; Davies & Stone (eds.) 1995a,\n1995b.) In recent years, proponents of both sides have increasingly\nconverged on common ground, allowing that both theory and simulation\nplay some role in the attribution of mental states to others (see\nCarruthers 2003; Goldman 2006; Nichols & Stich 2003). Many such\nhybrid accounts include a role for imagination.\n\nOn theory theory views, mindreading involves the application\nof some (tacit) folk psychological theory that allows the subject to\nmake predictions and offer explanations of the target\u2019s beliefs\nand behaviors. On pure versions of such accounts, imagination plays no\nspecial role in the attribution of mental states to others. (For an\noverview of theory theory, see entry on\n folk psychology as a theory).\n\nOn simulation theory views, mindreading involves simulating\nthe target\u2019s mental states so as to exploit similarities between\nthe subject\u2019s and target\u2019s processing capacities. It is\nthis simulation that allows the subject to make predictions and offer\nexplanations of the target\u2019s beliefs and behaviors. (For early\npapers, see Goldman 1989; Gordon 1986; Heal 1986; for recent dissent,\nsee, for example, Carruthers 2009; Gallagher 2007; Saxe 2005, 2009;\nfor an overview of simulation theory, see entry on\n folk psychology as mental simulation).\n\nTraditional versions of simulation theory typically describe\nsimulation using expressions such as \u201cimaginatively putting\noneself in the other\u2019s place\u201d. How this metaphor is\nunderstood depends on the specific account. (A collection of papers\nexploring various versions of simulation theory can be found in Dokic\n& Proust (eds.) 2002.) On many accounts, the projection is assumed\nto involve the subject\u2019s imaginatively running mental processes\n\u201coff-line\u201d that are directly analogous to those being run\n\u201con-line\u201d by the target (for example Goldman 1989).\nWhereas the \u201con-line\u201d mental processes are genuine, the\n\u201coff-line\u201d mental processes are merely imagined. For\nexample, a target that is deciding whether to eat sushi for lunch is\nrunning their decision-making processes \u201con-line\u201d; and a\nsubject that is simulating the target\u2019s decision-making is\nrunning the analogous processes \u201coff-line\u201d\u2014in part,\nby imagining the relevant mental states of the target. Recent\nempirical work in psychology has explored the accuracy of such\nprojections (Markman, Klein, & Suhr (eds.) 2009, section V; Saxe\n2005, 2006, 2009.)\n\nThough classic simulationist accounts have tended to assume that the\nsimulation process is at least in-principle accessible to\nconsciousness, a number of recent simulation-style accounts appeal to\nneuroscientific evidence suggesting that at least some simulative\nprocesses take place completely unconsciously. On such accounts of\nmindreading, no special role is played by conscious imagination (see\nGoldman 2009; Saxe 2009.)\n\nMany contemporary views of mindreading are hybrid theory\nviews according to which both theorizing and simulation play a role in\nthe understanding of others\u2019 mental states. Alvin Goldman\n(2006), for example, argues that while mindreading is primarily the\nproduct of simulation, theorizing plays a role in certain cases as\nwell. Many recent discussions have endorsed hybrid views of this sort,\nwith more or less weight given to each of the components in particular\ncases (see Carruthers 2003; Nichols & Stich 2003.)\n\nA number of philosophers have suggested that the mechanisms underlying\nsubjects\u2019 capacity to engage in mindreading are those that\nenable engagement in pretense behavior (Currie & Ravenscroft 2002;\nGoldman 2006; Nichols & Stich 2003; for an overview of recent\ndiscussions, see Carruthers 2009.) According to such accounts,\nengaging in pretense involves imaginatively taking up perspectives\nother than one\u2019s own, and the ability to do so skillfully may\nrely on\u2014and contribute to\u2014one\u2019s ability to\nunderstand those alternate perspectives (see the entry on\n empathy).\n Partly in light of these considerations, the relative lack of\nspontaneous pretense in children with autistic spectrum disorders is\ntaken as evidence for a link between the skills of pretense and\nempathy.\n",
