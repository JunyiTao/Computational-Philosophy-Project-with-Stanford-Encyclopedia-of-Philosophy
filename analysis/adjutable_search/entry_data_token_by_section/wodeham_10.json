    "main_text": "Philosophical Theology || Proof of God\u2019s Unicity\n5.2 Proof of God\u2019s Unicity\n\nFrom the philosophical proof of the existence of the highest being,\nnot always demonstrative, but evident in at least the second degree,\nWodeham turns to the question of whether there is one highest being or\nmany. The question found in Lectura, I, q. 1, a. 3, and the\nOrdinatio I, d. 2, a. 2 is posed in an ambiguous way. It asks\nwhether it is evidently probable that something absolutely\nuncausable is only one in number. The question is ambiguous because it\nis not immediately clear whether Wodeham\u2019s intention is to show\nthat there is only one God or if he intends to evaluate the relative\ndegrees of evidence of the existing proofs of God\u2019s unicity or\nmultiplicity.\n\nAs the question progresses, it appears that Wodeham is primarily\ninterested in evaluating the evidence of both pro and con arguments.\nWodeham juxtaposes arguments of Scotus against counter arguments of\nOckham in order to argue that the unicity of God cannot be\ndemonstrably proven. Ultimately, he argues that its seems that natural\nreason is not able to prove evidently the numerical unity of God (LS\nII:144). He argues for the inconclusiveness of several arguments\nincluding: the argument that proceeds from the belief that there\ncannot be several total causes of the same effect (LS II:144); that\nthere cannot be more than one necessary being (LS II:159); and that\nthere cannot be more than one final cause (OO I, q. 2, a. 2, dubium\n5). In the end, Wodeham is not interested in denying that there is\nonly one God, but he simply wants to show that the relatively strong\narguments for God\u2019s unicity do not reach the third and highest\ndegree of evidence.\n\nEven when it comes to the specific unity of God, which is granted only\na brief discussion in the Lectura secunda and is left out of\nthe Ordinatio altogether, Wodeham shows some hesitation. He\nwrites: \u201cI say that the argument of Scotus given above is\nprobably able to be persuasive\u201d (LS II: 171). Thus he again\nshows that even though it is his own opinion that God is specifically\none, it is possible for doubt to continue to linger.\n",
