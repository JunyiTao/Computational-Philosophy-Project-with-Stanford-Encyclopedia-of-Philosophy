    "main_text": "Algebras and their philosophy\n3. Algebras and their philosophy\n\n\nPeirce was primarily an algebraist in his mathematical style; for\nexample, he was enthusiastic for the cause of quaternions in mechanics\nafter their introduction by W. R. Hamilton in the mid 1840s, and of the\nvarious traditions in mechanics he showed some favour for the\n\u2018analytical\u2019 approach, where this adjective refers to the\nlinks to algebra. His best remembered publication was a treatment of\n\u2018linear associative algebras\u2019, that is, all algebras in\nwhich the associative law\nx(yz)=(xy)z was upheld.\n\u2018Linear\u2019 did not carry the connotation of matrix theory,\nwhich was still being born in others' hands, but referred to the form\nof linear combination, such as: \nq = a + bi + cj + dk\n\n\nin the case of a quaternion q. Peirce wrote an extensive\nsurvey (Peirce 1870), determining the numbers of all algebras with from\ntwo to six elements obeying also various other laws (Walsh 2000, ch.\n2). To two of those he gave names which have become durable:\n\u2018idempotent\u2019, the law xm =\nx (for m\u22652) which George Boole had introduced in\nthis form in his algebra of logic in 1847; and \u2018nilpotent\u2019,\nwhen xm = 0, for some m. The\nhistory of the publication of this work is very unusual\n(Grattan-Guinness 1997). Peirce had presented some of his results from\n1867 onwards to the National Academy of Sciences, of which he had been\nappointed a founder member four years earlier; but they could not\nafford to print it. Thus, in an initiative taken by Coast Survey staff,\na lady without mathematical training but possessing a fine hand was\nfound who could both read his ghastly script and write out the entire\ntext 12 pages at a time on lithograph stones. 100 copies were printed\n(Peirce 1870), and distributed world-wide to major mathematicians and\nprofessional colleagues. Eleven years later Charles, then at Johns\nHopkins University, had the lithograph reprinted posthumously, with\nsome additional notes of his own, as a long paper in American journal\nof mathematics, which J.J. Sylvester had recently launched (Peirce\n1881a); it also came out in book form in the next year. This study\nhelped mathematicians to recognise an aspect of the wide variety of\nalgebras which could be examined; it also played a role in the\ndevelopment of model theory in the U.S. in the early 1900s. Enough work\non it had been done by then for a book-length study to be written (Shaw\n1907). \n",
