    "main_text": "Preliminaries || Indexical and Non-Indexical Uses of Pronouns\n1.2 Indexical and Non-Indexical Uses of Pronouns\n\n\nSome of the expressions in the earlier list of indexicals have both\nindexical and non-indexical uses. In particular, the pronouns\n\u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, \u2018his\u2019, and\n\u2018hers\u2019 appear to have three different types of use:\nindexical uses (sometimes called deictic or\ndemonstrative uses), bound variable uses, and\nunbound anaphoric uses (Kaplan 1989a, pp. 489\u201390; Partee\n1989).\n\n\nThe pronouns in (1)\u2013(2) would typically be used as indexicals in\nutterances of (1)\u2013(2) that are accompanied by pointing gestures.\n\n(1)\n\nHe was born in Detroit. [Pointing at John]\n(2)\n\nHer paper was published. [Pointing at Mary]\n\n\n\nWhen used demonstratively, the extensions and contents of\n\u2018he\u2019, \u2018her\u2019, and sentences (1) and (2) can vary\nfrom context to context, depending in some way on the speaker\u2019s\ndemonstrations or referential intentions or other contextual\nfactors.\n\n\nBy contrast, the occurrence of \u2018he\u2019 and\n\u2018her\u2019 in (3) and (4), on the relevant ways of understanding\nthem, function like occurrences of variables bound by quantifier\nphrases.\n\n(3)\n\nEvery young boy thinks that he will go to school.\n(4)\n\nEvery young girl rode her bike.\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, we could reasonably symbolize (3) and (4) with (5) and\n(6) below.\n\n(5)\n\n(Every \\(x: x\\) is a young boy) \\(x\\) thinks that \\(x\\) will go to school.\n\n(6)\n\n(Every \\(x: x\\) is a young girl) \\(x\\) rode \\(x\\)\u2019s bike.\n\n\n\n\nThe contents of (5) and (6) do not vary from context to context (or\nat least do not do so in virtue of the occurrences of the\npronouns).\n\n\nFinally, these same pronouns are also sometimes used as unbound\nanaphors. That is, some occurrences seem not to be used\ndemonstratively, and not to be within the scope of prior explicit\nquantifier phrases or other binding linguistic expressions, and yet\nseem to depend for their interpretation on prior occurrences of\nlinguistic expressions. (See the entries on \n anaphora and \n discourse representation theory.) \nFor example, \u2018he\u2019 appears to be used as an unbound anaphor\nin discourse (7) and \u2018she\u2019 seems to be so used in (8).\n\n(7)\n\nJohnny was riding a bike. He was having a good time.\n\n(8)\n\nA woman came to my office today. She worked for Gigantic Academic\nPress. She tried to persuade me to adopt their logic book.\n\n\n\n\nThese three uses of pronouns seem quite different. Consequently,\nKaplan (1989b, p. 572) sometimes says that \u2018he\u2019 is\nlexically ambiguous, and that the demonstrative \u2018he\u2019 and\nthe anaphoric \u2018he\u2019 are homonymous expressions (Kaplan\n1989b, p. 593). Most theorists, however, do not hold that these\npronouns are ambiguous or that these uses involve distinct homonymous\nwords. Many theorists who work on demonstratives and anaphora\nemphasize their similarities to variables. For demonstratives and\nvariables, see Heim and Kratzer 1998, chapter 9; for anaphora and\nvariables, see Kamp and Reyle 1993, Chierchia 1992, and Salmon\n2006. For related discussion, see Partee (1989), Condoravdi and Gawron\n(1996), and Neale (2005).\n\n\nFor the rest of this article, we concentrate exclusively on\ndemonstrative uses of the above pronouns.\n",
