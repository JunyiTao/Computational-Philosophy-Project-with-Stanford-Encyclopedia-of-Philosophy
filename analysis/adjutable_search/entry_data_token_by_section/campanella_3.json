    "main_text": "The Calabrian Conspiracy and Prophecy in The City of the Sun\n4. The Calabrian Conspiracy and Prophecy in The City of the Sun\n\nAfter having submitted to an inquest in Naples over his advocacy of\nTelesian philosophy in 1592, Campanella went first to Rome, then to\nFlorence and Padua, where, at the beginning of 1594, he was denounced\nand arrested for heresy. In October he was transferred to a prison of\nthe Roman Inquisition, in which the \u201cheretical\u201d Florentine\nFrancesco Pucci and the philosopher Giordano Bruno were imprisoned. In\na sonnet entitled \u201cAl carcere\u201d (\u201cTo Jail\u201d),\nCampanella could not but reflect on the fact that free spirits who,\nabandoning the stagnant waters of a traditional culture in order to\nhurl themselves boldly into the \u201csea of truth\u201d, found\nthemselves enclosed, as if by a tragic and fatal destiny, in the\ndismal palace of the Inquisition, that he compares to the cave of\nPolyphemus, the labyrinth of Crete and the palace of Atlas\n(Poesie, 1998, p. 254). Accused of supporting atomist and\natheist doctrines, he was condemned in 1595 \u201con grave suspicion\nof heresy\u201d and forced to make a formal public abjuration. At the\nend of 1597 the superiors of the Dominican Order commanded him to\nreturn to Calabria.\n\nAlmost thirty years of age and after ten years of absence, Campanella\nreturned to Stilo on August 15, 1598. The next year he was involved in\nthe most dramatic events of his life. He became convinced by his\nreading of astrological and prophet texts that announced profound\nchanges, by the appearance of abnormal celestial signs and natural\nevents and, above all, by the miserable and unjust condition of the\npopulation and by serious social and political disorders that the end\nof the century would bring a period of great upheaval. A vast\nconspiracy, of which he was indisputably the spiritual leader, was\norganized with the aim of transforming the province into a republic\nand removing it from the tyrannical rule of the king of Spain. The\nplot never got underway because on August 10, 1599 it was revealed to\nthe Spanish authorities by two of the conspirators. After frenzied\nattempts to escape, Campanella was arrested. In November four galleys\narrived at the port of Naples carrying dozens of prisoners. Some were\ndangling, having been hanged from banners; others were dismembered in\nthe port, a pitiless reminder to the crowd who, full of curiosity and\nhorror, had come to see the terrible spectacle.\n\nIn defending himself, Campanella firmly denied the accusation of\nrebellion, maintaining that he had not acted out of personal ambition\nor malevolence toward the king but rather had been following human and\ndivine prophecies. Astrological tables had predicted an unusual\nsuccession of eclipses in the first years of the new century.\nAccording to a famous prognostication, De eversione Europae,\nattributed to Antonius Arquatus, that had foretold events such as the\ncoming of Luther and the Sack of Rome, the Turks, after a period of\ncontinual ascent, at the time of their fifteenth sultan would be\ndivided between the two sons of their sovereign\u2014just as the\nmoon, their emblem, halfway through its course begins to divide into\ntwo horns\u2014one of whom would become an adherent of Christianity,\nwhile the other would be defeated by the king of Spain. Recently, the\nprophecy of Abbot Ubertino of Otranto had been miraculously recovered\nand predicted great political changes, the coronation of a new king in\nFrance and the beginning of the sixth age of the Church. The year\n1600, moreover, appeared to be a crucial moment, a \u201cgreat\nturning-point\u201d in time, in that it was composed of a hundred\ntimes seven and nine, both of which were fatal numbers according to\nPythagoras and Plato.\n\nIn the second of two written defences, Campanella sought to justify\nand legitimate his own initiative by placing it within a prophetic\ncontext, so that it would not be regarded as an act of rebellion,\nwhich would entail the death penalty. He later developed this work as\nthe Articuli prophetales, but during his trial he decided\nthat presenting it to his judges would be a futile effort. Instead, he\nresorted to a clever ploy in order to avoid capital punishment. The\ndeath penalty could not be inflicted on those deemed insane because,\nsince they were not in a position to repent, the judges would be\nresponsible for the eternal damnation of their souls. Clinging to this\njudicial cavil, Campanella pretended for many months to be out of his\nmind. His condition was, in the end, confirmed by means of a horrible\nform of torture, called the \u201cvigil\u201d because, in addition\nto the bodily suffering that was inflicted, victims were also\nsubjected to prolonged sleep deprivation. He would refer to this\nterrible moment in his life as proof of the freedom of the human will,\nthat cannot be bowed even by the most extreme physical pressure.\nAlthough disillusioned and embittered by the catastrophic result of\nhis noble Calabrian plan, Campanella questioned himself about the\nreasons for this failure, reflecting on the role of the prophet who,\nas bearer of an uncomfortable and unpleasant message for those in\npower, cannot avoid being persecuted and put to death. Having achieved\nthe supreme good of preserving his life, he wrote his most famous\nwork, The City of the Sun, in the form of a \u201cpoetical\ndialogue\u201d between a Genoese sailor who had accompanied Columbus\non his voyage to America and a Knight Hospitaller. It first appeared\nin Latin translation as the appendix to his Politica,\npublished in Frankfurt in 1623. His aim was to describe an ideal model\nof society that, in contrast to the violence, disorder and\nirrationality of the real world, was in harmony with nature,\nunderstood as an expression of God\u2019s intrinsic \u201cart\u201d and\nwisdom. He was, in fact, convinced that present-day society was a\nlabyrinth of injustice and unhappiness precisely because it had\ndeviated from this natural model. The more a city constituted a\n\u201cbody politic,\u201d the happier it would be, with its\nindividual parts integrated so as to form a unitary organism and its\nvarious limbs, diversified according to function, entirely coordinated\nto serve the communal well-being.\n\nProtected and defended by seven circles of walls, constructed of\npalaces that serve as dwellings for the citizens, the city is located\nin a place with an ideal climate, conducive to physical health, and on\nthe slope of a hillside because the air there is lighter and purer.\nOne of the most significant aspects of this community is the\ndistribution of work. Once again Campanella engages in an explicit\npolemic with Aristotle, who had excluded artisans, peasants and those\ninvolved in manual labor from the category of full citizenship and\nfrom the highest levels of virtue. In the City of the Sun no\noccupation is vile or base, and all are of equal dignity\u2014in\nfact, those workers who are required to expend greater effort, such as\nartisans and builders, receive more praise. Everyone must be\nacquainted with all lines of work, and then each person practices the\none for which he shows the greatest aptitude. They have no servants,\nand no service is regarded as unworthy. The only thing that they\nconsider to be despicable is idleness, and in this way they come to\nprivilege the dignity of work and to overturn an absurd conception of\nnobility, linked to inactivity and vice. Thanks to the equal division\nof labor, it is sufficient for each person to spend only four hours a\nday working; but it is essential that they all work, because the\nidleness of one would have repercussions on the profit and the effort\nof the others. The citizens possess nothing; instead, everything is\nheld in common, from food to houses, from the acquisition of knowledge\nto the exercise of activities, from honors to amusements, from women\nto children. There are \u201cofficials\u201d in charge of the\ndistribution of each thing, who keep an eye out and make sure that\nthis happens justly, but no one can appropriate anything for himself.\nAccording to them, possession of a house or a family reinforces\n\u201cself-love\u201d, with all the dire consequences this\ngenerates. They live \u201clike philosophers in common\u201d because\nthey are aware of the negative impact, not only on the social but also\non the moral level, of an unequal distribution of goods.\n\nOne of the most spectacular and imaginative aspects of The City of\nthe Sun, which immediately struck its readers, are the painted\nwalls of the city. Apart from enclosing and protecting the city, the\nwalls are also the curtains of an extraordinary theater and the pages\nof an illustrated encyclopedia of knowledge. The walls of the palaces\nare painted with images of the all the arts and sciences. Starting\nwith the wall that holds up the columns of the temple and gradually\ndescending in large circles, following the order of the planets from\nMercury to Saturn, we encounter illustrations of the heavens and the\nstars, of mathematical figures, of every country on earth and of all\nthe marvels and secrets of the mineral, vegetable and animal worlds,\nuntil we arrive at mankind: on the internal wall of the sixth circle\nthe mechanical arts and their inventors are represented. Campanella\nwas greatly interested in all ingenious discoveries, and in The\nCity of the Sun he provides many examples of curious inventions,\nsuch as vessels able to navigate without wind and without sails, and\nstirrups that make it possible to guide a horse using only one\u2019s feet,\nleaving one\u2019s hands free. On the external wall legislators are\ndepicted; and it is here, in \u201ca place of great\nhonor\u201d\u2014but along with Moses, Osiris, Jove, Mercury and\nMuhammad\u2014that the Genoese sailor recognizes Christ and the\ntwelve apostles. Knowledge is not enclosed in books kept in separate\nplaces such as libraries but is openly on show to everyone\u2019s eyes.\nVisualizing in this manner promotes a quicker, easier and more\nefficient form of learning, in that it is connected to the art of\nmemory, which underlines the evocative and emotive power of images.\nFrom a tender age children run around in this theater of knowledge,\nappropriately guided and following correct itineraries, so that they\nlearn joyously, as if playing a game, without effort or pain.\n\nIn addition to the community of goods and the painted walls, another\ncharacteristic feature of the City of the Sun, one that is more\ndifficult and disconcerting and that Campanella himself describes as\n\u201chard and arduous\u201d, is the community of wives. This is the\nsolution adopted by the citizens to the problem of generation. Echoing\nthe teaching of the Pythagorean Ocellus Lucanus, Campanella says that\nthey are amazed that humans are preoccupied by the breeding of horses\nand dogs while neglecting their own. The act of generation entails a\nlarge responsibility of the part of the parents; and if it is\nexercised in an incorrect manner, it can give rise to a long chain of\nsuffering. Moreover, there is a close connection between a person\u2019s\nnatural \u201ccomplexion\u201d or character, which is inborn and not\nafterwards modifiable, and moral virtue, which needs a suitable\nterrain in order to take root and prosper. Generation should therefore\nrespect precise norms and not be entrusted to chance nor to individual\nsentiments. The citizens distinguish between love and sex. Affection\nbetween men and women, based on friendship and respect more than\nsexual attraction, is expressed in acts that are far removed from\nsexuality, such as exchanges of gifts, conversation and dancing.\nSexual generation, on the other hand, must obey strict rules regarding\nthe physical and moral qualities of the parents and the choice of a\npropitious time for conception, determined by an astrologer. Such a\nunion is not the expression of a personal, emotional or passionate\nrelationship, but rather is connected to the social responsibility of\ngeneration and to love for the collective community.\n\nThe religious beliefs of the citizenry, even though they include\nfundamental principles of Christianity such as the immortality of the\nsoul and divine providence, form a natural religion that establishes a\nsort of osmosis between the city and the stars. The temple is open and\nnot surrounded by walls. In one of his poems Campanella promises:\n\u201cI shall make the heavens a temple and the stars an altar\u201d\n(Poesie, 1998, p. 327). On the vault of the temple\u2019s dome the\nstars are depicted together with their influence on earthly affairs.\nThe altar, on which are placed a celestial and a terrestrial globe, is\nin the form of the sun. Prayers are directed toward the heavens. The\ntask of the twenty-four priests, who live in cells located in the\nhighest part of the temple, is to observe the stars and, using\nastronomical instruments, to take account of all their movements. It\nis their job to indicate the times most favorable for generation and\nfor agricultural labors, acting in this way as intermediaries between\nGod and human beings.\n",
