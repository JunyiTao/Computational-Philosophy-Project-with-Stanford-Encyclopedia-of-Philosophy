    "main_text": "Constitutive Aim || Objections\n6.2 Objections\n\nA number of challenges have been raised in the literature to the claim\nthat there must be a constitutive aim of action. First, suppose we\naccept the causal theory of action: an intentional action just is the\neffect of a \u201cprimary reason\u201d. On such a view, it seems\nthat an intentional action is constituted by its causal antecedents,\nrather than by a necessary aim that one has in acting. However, causal\ntheories are not incompatible with constitutivism. Since on these\nviews, some of the causal antecedents of the action will be conative\nstates (like an intention), the question of whether intentional action\nhas a constitutive aim will depend on whether the conative state has a\nconstitutive aim or whether a specific conative state must always\nfigure on the genesis of intentional action. For instance, in\nVelleman\u2019s early work (for instance, Velleman 1989), intentional\naction was an action that was caused by a desire for self-knowledge,\nand the content of such a desire was thus the constitutive aim of\nagency. Smith (2013; 2015; 2019) also develops a form of\nconstitutivism that endorses the standard story of action.\n\nSetiya raises a couple of important challenges to the idea that action\nhas a constitutive aim. According to Setiya (2007), any theory of\naction needs to account for the fact that practical knowledge (or a\nbelief condition in his version; see section 4 of this entry) is\nessential to intentional action. However, the belief condition seems\nto be conceptually independent of any constitutive aim of action, and\nthus accepting that both are constitutive of intentional action\namounts to postulating an unexplained necessary connection.\n\nSecondly, Setiya (2010) relies on the distinction between an\nexplanatory reason and a normative reason to argue against the\n\u201cguise of the good\u201d (see Alvarez 2017 for a detailed\naccount of the distinction); his argument there could be extended to\nother proposals for the constitutive aim of action. An intentional\naction is an action done for an explanatory reason, namely, a\nreason that explains why the agent acted as she did, in\nAnscombe\u2019s special sense of the question \u2018Why\u2019.\nHowever, Setiya points out that an explanatory reason need not be a\nnormative reason; in fact, any reason that the agent believes\nto be her reason to act can be an explanatory reason, even if the\nobject of such a reason is not good in any way. But since the reasons\nthat explain intentional action need not be good in any way, it seems\nfalse that the agent must act only on reasons that she regards to be\ngood in some way, and thus that she aims at the good in acting.\n\nPhilosophers have tried to answer these challenges. One can argue that\na knowledge or belief condition, to the extent that it is valid, is\nexplained by the constitutive aim of action. Moreover, perhaps the\npossibility of a third-person explanation of an action in terms of\nexplanatory reasons whose objects are not good in any way is\ncompatible with the fact that from the first-person point of view,\nthese objects must have been regarded to be good in some way. So even\nif the fact that Rugen kills his father explains why Inigo Montoya\nkilled Rugen without providing a normative reason for it, it still\nmight be the case that avenging his father must have appeared good\nto Inigo Montoya in some way if he killed Rugen intentionally\n(see Tenenbaum 2012).\n\nAnother well-known challenge to the idea that actions have a\nconstitutive aim is David Enoch\u2019s \u201cschmagency\u201d\nobjection (Enoch 2006; 2011); in this context, the objection raises\nthe possibility that for any purported constitutive aim, one could\nspurn such an aim and merely \u201cschmact\u201d or be a mere\n\u201cschmagent\u201d\u2014someone who behaves just like an agent\nexcept for having the constitutive aim of agency. Enoch\u2019s\nobjection, however, is specifically concerned with attempts to derive\nnormative consequences from the constitutive aim of action (for\nfurther discussion, see Bagnoli 2017; 2022).\n",
