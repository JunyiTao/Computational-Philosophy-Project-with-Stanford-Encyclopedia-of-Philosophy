    "main_text": "The Critical Treatises || On the Eternity of the World Against Aristotle\n3.2 On the Eternity of the World Against Aristotle\n\n\nPhiloponus\u2019 battle against eternalism may be divided into three\nstages. The treatise Against Proclus is followed by a second\nand even more provocative publication, On the Eternity of the\nWorld against Aristotle. This work was published c. 530\u2013534 and\ninvolved a close scrutiny of the first chapters of Aristotle\u2019s\nOn the Heavens (his theory of ether as the fifth element, of\nwhich the heavenly bodies are made) and the eighth book of the\nPhysics (arguing for the eternity of time and motion). The\nthird stage is represented by one, perhaps two, non-polemical\ntreatises that have survived in fragments which indicate that numerous\narguments against eternity and for creation were arranged in some kind\nof systematic order.\n\n Like the polemic against Proclus, Against Aristotle is\nmainly devoted to removing obstacles for the creationist. If Aristotle\nwere right about the existence of an immutable fifth element (ether)\nin the celestial region, and if he were right about motion and time\nbeing eternal, any belief in creation would surely be\nunwarranted. Philoponus succeeds in pointing to numerous\ncontradictions, inconsistencies, fallacies and improbable assumptions\nin Aristotle\u2019s philosophy of nature relating to these\nclaims. Dissecting Aristotle\u2019s texts in an unprecedented way, he\ntime and again turns the tables on Aristotle and so paves the way for\ndemonstrative arguments for non-eternity. One such argument is\nreported by Simplicius (In Phys. 1178,7\u20131179,26 = Contra\nAristotelem, Fr. 132). It relies on three premises: (1) If the\nexistence of something requires the preexistence of something else,\nthen any one thing will not come to be without the prior existence\nof the other. (2) An infinite number cannot exist in actuality, nor\nbe traversed in counting, nor be increased.  (3) Something cannot come\ninto being if its existence requires the preexistence of an infinite\nnumber of other things, one arising out of the other. From these not\nat all un-Aristotelian premises Philoponus deduces that the conception\nof a temporally infinite universe, understood as a successive causal\nchain, is impossible. The celestial spheres of Aristotelian theory\nhave different periods of revolution, and in any given number of years\nthey undergo different numbers of revolutions, some larger than\nothers. The assumption of their motion having gone on for all eternity\nleads to the conclusion that infinity can be increased, even\nmultiplied, which Aristotle himself held to be absurd.\n\n The non-polemical anti-eternalist treatises exploit, among others,\nAristotle\u2019s argument that an infinite power\n(d\u00fanamis) cannot reside in a finite body\n(Phys. VIII 10). Philoponus infers that since the universe is\na finite body, it cannot have the d\u00fanamis to exist for\nan infinite time. As in the case of his theory of light, this argument\ninvolves a not at all un-Aristotelian shift of meaning of the argument\u2019s central concept. There, en\u00e9rgeia shifted from \u2018actuality\u2019 to \u2018activity\u2019; in the context of Aristotle\u2019s argument in\nPhys. VIII 10, d\u00fanamis meant \u2018power or kinetic\nforce\u2019, but Philoponus employs the word in the sense of\n\u2018capacity\u2019 or \u2018fitness to exist\u2019.\n",
