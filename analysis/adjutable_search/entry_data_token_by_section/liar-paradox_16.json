    "main_text": "Some Families of Solutions || Inconsistency views\n4.6 Inconsistency views\n\nIn\n \u00a72.3.3\n we saw that the Liar paradox, in the presence of unrestricted capture\nand release and classical logic, leads to contradiction. So long as we\nhave EFQ (as classical logic does), this results in triviality. Most\nof the proposed solutions we have considered (with the exception of\nthe revision theory) try to avoid this result somehow, either by\nrestricting capture and release or departing from classical logic. But\nthere is another idea that has occasionally been argued, that the Liar\nparadox simply shows that the kinds of languages we speak, which\ncontain their own truth predicates, are inconsistent.\n\nThis is not an easy view to formulate. Though Tarski himself seemed to\nsuggest something along these lines (for natural languages,\nspecifically), it was argued by Herzberger (1967) that it is\nimpossible to have an inconsistent language.\n\nIn contrast, Eklund (2002) takes seriously the idea that our semantic\nintuitions, expressed, for instance, by unrestricted capture and\nrelease, really are inconsistent. Eklund grants that this does not\nmake sense if these intuitions have their source simply in our grasp\nof the truth conditions of sentences. But he suggests an alternative\npicture of semantic competence which does make sense of it (closely\nrelated to conceptual role views of meaning). He suggests that we\nthink of semantic competence in terms of a range of principles\nspeakers are disposed to accept in virtue of knowing a language. Those\nprinciples may be inconsistent. But even so, they determine semantic\nvalues. Semantic values will be whatever comes closest to satisfying\nthe principles\u2014whatever makes them maximally correct\u2014even\nif nothing can satisfy all of them due to an underlying\ninconsistency.\n\nEklund thus supports an idea suggested by Chihara (1979).\nChihara\u2019s main aim is to provide what he calls a\ndiagnosis of the paradox, which should explain why the\nparadox arises and why it appears compelling. But along the way, he\nsuggests that the source of the paradox is our acceptance of the\nT-schema (by convention, he suggests), in spite of its\ninconsistency.\n\nA related, though distinct, view is defended by Patterson (2007,\n2009). Patterson argues that competence with a language puts one in a\ncognitive state relating to an inconsistent theory\u2014one including\nthe unrestricted T-schema and governed by classical logic. He goes on\nto explore how such a cognitive state could allow us to successfully\ncommunicate, in spite of relating us to a false theory.\n\nA different sort of inconsistency theory is advocated by Scharp\n(2013). Scharp argues that truth is an inconsistent concept, like the\npre-relativistic concept of mass. As such, it is unsuitable for\ncareful theorizing. What we need to do, according to Scharp, is\nreplace the inconsistent concept of truth with a family of consistent\nconcepts that work better. Scharp develops just such a family of\nconcepts, and offers a theory of them.\n",
