Preliminary Remarks\n\nBurley\u2019s views are especially interesting for historians of logic and\nmetaphysics because of their originality, wide influence, and\ndevelopment. Twice during the course of his academic career, in the\nfirst and third decades of the fourteenth century, Burley worked out\nslightly different versions of the same semantic theory in connection\nwith two different conceptions of reality. The first version\n(elaborated in De sup., QP, the middle commentaries\non Aristotle\u2019s Categories and De interpretatione,\nand Ean) is somewhat less sophisticated than the second\n(elaborated in De puritate artis logicae, tractatus longior,\nthe last commentaries on the Physics and Ars Vetus,\nand theTdU). Whereas in his early works Burley was able to\ndifferentiate the intension of an expression (the universal form) from\nits extension (the individuals instantiating that universal form), in\nhis last commentary on the Ars Vetus he distinguishes between\nsense (the mental universal existing in the mind as an object of\nunderstanding) and reference (significatum) of an expression,\nwhich in turn is divided into its intension (the universal) and\nextension (the individuals).\n\nNevertheless, the three main principles of his semantic theory\nremained the same throughout his academic career:\n\nAn abstract term, such as \u2018humanity\u2019\n(\u2018humanitas\u2019) or \u2018whiteness\u2019\n(\u2018albedo\u2019), signifies a common form, which is\npart of the essential nature of numerous individuals, and which has\nthe same kind of existence (extramental or mental) as these\nindividuals.\nConcrete accidental terms do not signify simple objects, but\naggregates composed of a substance and accidental form.\nA sentence is true if and only if it is the sign of \u201cthe\ntruth of things\u201d (veritas rerum), that is, if it\ndescribes how the things are in the world.\n\n\nBut in developing the ontology behind his first semantic system,\nBurley did not subscribe to the same theses that eventually came to\ncharacterize his radically realist ontology, but different ones,\nconsistent with the canons of the moderate realism:\n\nOnly absolute categories (substance, quantity, and quality) are\nreal things; the other categories are said to be \u201creal\naspects\u201d (respectus reales) of the absolute\ncategories\nUniversals have being in individuals, as constitutive parts of\ntheir essence\nReal propositions (propositiones in re) properly exist in\nour mind \u201cobjectively\u201d (obiective), that is, as\nobjects of its act of judgment\n\n\nOn the other hand, Burley\u2019s approach to the matter does not differ\nfrom the one he took in his late maturity. It can be defined as\nanalytical, since he believes that ontologies must be developed in\nrelation to the resolution of semantic problems, and that a\nphilosophical explanation of reality must be preceded by a semantic\nexplanation of the structure and function of our language, even if we\ncan only give meaning to linguistic expressions by correlating the\nexpressions of our language with objects in the world.\n\nBurley\u2019s change of mind about universals was brought about by Ockham\u2019s\ncritique of the traditional realist conception, which demonstrated\nthat the common moderate realist account of the relation between\nlanguage and the world is inconsistent. There is no sign in Burley\u2019s\nworks prior to 1324 that he regarded Ockham as an opponent, but\nbeginning with the prologue to his final commentary on the\nPhysics (a work presumably rewritten in response to Ockham\u2019s\ncriticisms), his main writings on logic and metaphysics always feature\nan analysis of Ockham\u2019s views together with a serious attempt to\nrefute his arguments.\n\nWhat Ockham had argued was that the common realist account of the\nrelation between universals and particulars is inconsistent with the\nstandard definition of identity, and also that particular substances\nand qualities have only an extramental kind of existence, whereas the\nten Aristotelian categories serve to classify mental, written and\nspoken terms, but not things outside the mind. Two facts prove clearly\nthat Burley changed his mind because of his having come into contact\nwith Ockham. First, the problem of universals is not even mentioned in\nhis first commentary on the Physics (before 1316), but\nreceives extensive treatment in the prologue of his second commentary\non the Physics, where he quotes, analyses, and rejects\narguments advanced by the Venerabilis Inceptor. Second,\nBurley\u2019s final commentaries on the Physics, Ars\nVetus, and the TdU contain critiques of Ockham\u2019s views\non universals, truth, and categories, as well as replies to his\narguments against the standard moderate realist doctrine. Moreover,\nBurley seems to believe that Duns Scotus\u2019s strategy of drawing formal\ndistinctions does not work, since it implies a rejection of the\nstandard definition of identity according to which two things are\nidentical if and only if whatever is predicated of one is also\npredicated of the other (EP, ch. de oppositione,\nfol. 44rb; TdU, p. 22).\n\nThe result was a new theory of reality based on the following\ntheses:\n\nThe categories are really distinct from each other (EP,\nch. de sufficientia praedicamentorum, fol. 21ra\u2013b).\nUniversals and particulars are really distinct from each other\n(EPhys, prol., fol. 9rb; EP, ch. de\nsubstantia, passim; EPh, ch. de oppositione\nenuntiationum, fol. 74rb\u2013va; TdU, pp. 14\u201340);\nThe external world contains real propositions that are the\nsignificata of true sentences (EP, prooem.,\nfols. 17vb\u201318va; ch. de priori, fol. 47va; EPh,\nprol., fol. 66ra\u2013b);\n\n\nIt must be pointed out here that this \u2018new\u2019 theory is the most\ndiscussed point of Burley\u2019s philosophical system: J\u00f6el Biard,\nAlessandro D. Conti, Christian Rode, and Hans-Ulrich W\u00f6hler defend\nthe thesis of a plurality of theories, whereas Laurent Cesalli, Alain\nde Libera, and Stephan Meier-Oeser claim that Burley develops the same\ntheoretical intuition from 1301 (the date of composition of his\nQuaestiones in librum Perihermeneias) to 1337. Furthermore,\nthe real proposition described in the final commentary on the\nCategories is considered by Cesalli to be a sort of complex,\nimmanent, intentional object rather than an extramental state of\naffairs or a fact; other scholars, such as Gabriel Nuchelmans, Biard,\nand Rode, believe it to be a kind of mixed entity, partly mental,\npartly extra mental; finally, and a third group of scholars, such as\nConti, de Libera, Meier-Oeser, and Jan Pinborg, think of it in terms\nof a state of affairs or a fact. \n\nThe three theses mentioned above suggest a kind of identification of\nlogic and metaphysics, especially since Burley wanted logic to be the\ntheory of discourse on Being. Logic must be metaphysically grounded in\nthe correspondence between the structural features of discourse (both\nbetween the subject and predicate of a proposition, as well as between\nthe premises and conclusion of a syllogism) and the structure of\nreality. Burley maintains that logic is nothing but an analysis of the\ngeneral structures of reality. In discussing the nature, status, and\nsubject of logic in the introduction to his final commentary on the\nArs Vetus (fol. 2rb\u2013va), he claims that logic is about things\nof second intention as such, second intentions being those concepts of\nthings (conceptus rei) that arise when we see the common\nnature in relation to the things that instantiate it. Logic is\naccordingly about structural forms, which are, as forms, independent\nof the mental acts through which they are acquired. Through these\nstructural forms, the connections between the basic constituents of\nreality (individual and universals, substances and accidents) are\ndisclosed.\n",
