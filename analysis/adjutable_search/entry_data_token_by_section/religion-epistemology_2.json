    "main_text": "Evidentialism Defended\n3. Evidentialism Defended\n\n\nOne response to the problematic is to separate evidentialism from the\nhegemony of epistemology. Evidentialism may then be defended by noting\nhow we implicitly rely upon evidentialist principles in many different\nareas of enquiry, or by noting which principles generalise various\nparticular examples of justified  and unjustified\nreasoning.  Such a defence of evidentialism is part of\nthe project of some contemporary philosophers who seek to attack\ntheism in favour of agnosticism and/or atheism. This defence may well\nbe implicit in Flew\u2019s famous \u201cThe Presumption of Atheism\u201d\n(1972). It is more explicit in Scriven\u2019s\nPrimary Philosophy (1966, ch 4). Scriven and Flew are relying\non the Ockhamist principle that, in the absence of evidence for the\nexistence of things of kind X, belief in Xs is\nnot reasonable.  This they can defend by means of examples in which\nnon-Ockhamist thinking is judged not to be justified. So even if the\nwhole of evidentialism is not defended, the Ockhamist fragment of it\nmay be.\n\n\nNot surprisingly the reliance of non-theist philosophers on\nevidentialism has been criticised. First there is an ad hominem.\nShalkowski (1989) has pointed out that these defenders of\nevidentialism tend in fact to be atheists not agnostics, yet a careful\nexamination, he says, of the examples used to support Ockham\u2019s\nRazor show that either they are ones in which there is independent\nevidence for denying the existence of Xs or ones in which\nsuspense of judgement seems to be the appropriate response, not\ndenial. Another criticism is Plantinga\u2019s claim that\nevidentialism is self-referentially inconsistent for there is no\nevidence for evidentialism (Plantinga 1983: 60). This might be met in\neither of two ways. First, it could be said that all that is being\ndefended is the Ockhamist fragment of evidentialism and that this is\nnot itself vulnerable to Ockham\u2019s Razor. Or it could be argued\nthat deriving an epistemology from a wide range of examples is\nevidence for it. To be sure this is far from conclusive evidence. But\neven a less than full belief in an epistemological thesis which showed\ntheism to be unjustified would be damaging. This may be illustrated\nusing an example with artificial numerical precision: 80% confidence\nin an epistemology which showed that no degree of belief in theism\ngreater than 60% was justified is incompatible with a degree of belief\nin theism greater than 68%.  The person in question could have a\ndegree of belief of in the conjunction of theism and the (80% likely)\nepistemology of no greater than 48% (80% of 60%) and a degree of\nbelief in the conjunction of theism and the denial of that\nepistemology of no greater than 20% (since that epistemology has a\nprobability of 80%).\n\n",
