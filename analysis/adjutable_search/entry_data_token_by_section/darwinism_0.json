    "main_text": "Introduction\n1. Introduction\n\n\nScientific theories are historical entities.  Often you can identify\nkey individuals and documents that are the sources of new\ntheories\u2014Einstein\u2019s 1905 papers, Copernicus\u2019 1539 De\nRevolutionibus, Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of\nSpecies. Sometimes, but not always, the theory tends in popular\nparlance to be named after the author of these seminal documents, as\nis the case with Darwinism.  \n\n\nBut like every historical entity, theories undergo change through\ntime. Indeed a scientific theory might undergo such significant\nchanges that the only point of continuing to name it after\nits source is to identify its lineage and ancestry. This is decidedly\nnot the case with Darwinism. As Jean Gayon has put\nit:\n\n\nThe Darwin-Darwinism relation is in certain respects a causal\nrelation, in the sense that Darwin influenced the debates that\nfollowed him. But there is also something more: a kind of isomorphism\nbetween Darwin\u2019s Darwinism and historical Darwinism. It is as though\nDarwin\u2019s own contribution has constrained the conceptual and empirical\ndevelopment of evolutionary biology ever after. (Gayon 2003,\n241)\n\n\nDarwinism identifies a core set of concepts, principles and\nmethodological maxims that were first articulated and defended by\nCharles Darwin and which continue to be identified with a certain\napproach to evolutionary\n questions.[1]\n We will thus need to\nbegin with Darwin\u2019s Darwinism as articulated in On the Origin of\nSpecies in 1859. We will then examine these same themes as they\nhave been discussed by evolutionary biologists and philosophers of\nbiology from the beginnings of the Neo-Darwinian Synthesis to the\npresent.  \n\n\nCharles Darwin was not, as we use the term today, a philosopher,\nthough he was often so described during his\n lifetime.[2]\n Nevertheless, for an encyclopedia of philosophy what\nis needed is a discussion of the impact of philosophy on Darwin\u2019s\nDarwinism, and the impact of Darwin\u2019s Darwinism on topics that both\nhe, and we, would consider philosophical. We focus here on the impact\nof philosophical discussions about the nature of science during\nDarwin\u2019s lifetime on Darwin\u2019s scientific research, thinking and\nwriting; and on the impact of that research, thinking and writing on\nphilosophy.  Taking the time to do such philosophical\narchaeology  stems from a\nconviction that if the concept of Darwinism has legitimate application\ntoday, it is due to a set of principles, both scientific and\nphilosophical, that were articulated by Darwin and that are still\nwidely shared by those who call themselves \u2018Darwinians\u2019 or\n\u2018neo-Darwinians\u2019. \n",
