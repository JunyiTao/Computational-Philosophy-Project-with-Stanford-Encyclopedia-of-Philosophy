    "main_text": "Origins of the Medieval Discussion || Unlikely Ancient Sources\n1.1 Unlikely Ancient Sources\n\nNonetheless, it does not appear that medieval interest in insolubles\nwas derived directly from these or any other known ancient sources\nthat discuss the Liar. Many of the relevant works were lost (e.g., the\nworks of Chrysippus), while others were never translated into Latin\nand so were effectively unavailable to the Latin Middle Ages, though\nthings may be different for the Arabic and Byzantine traditions, which\nare only starting to be studied (see, e.g., Alwishah & Sanson\n2009, Gerogiorgakis 2009, El-Rouayheb 2020 and Zarepour 2020). Indeed,\nit is not at all clear just what it was that prompted medieval\ninterest. One might have supposed that, even if particular theories\nabout the Liar were not transmitted to the Latin West from antiquity,\nat least formulations of Liar-type paradoxes must have been known and\navailable to stimulate the medieval discussions. In fact, however,\nthere are strikingly few possibilities.\n\nSeneca (Epistle 45.10), for instance, mentions the Liar\nparadox by its Greek name pseudomenon, but does not actually\nformulate it. Again, St Augustine perhaps has the Liar in mind in his\nAgainst the Academicians (Contra academicos\nIII.13.29), where he refers to the \u201cmost lying calumny,\n\u2018if it is true [it is] false, if it is false it is\ntrue\u2019\u201d. But neither passage would likely be sufficient by\nitself to suggest the special problems of the Liar to anyone not\nalready familiar with them.\n\nSomewhat more explicit is Aulus Gellius\u2019s (2nd century CE)\nAttic Nights (XVIII.ii.10), \u201cWhen I lie and say I am\nlying, am I lying or speaking the truth?\u201d But Gellius was not\nwidely read in the Middle Ages, and no known medieval author cites him\nin the context of\n insolubles.[4]\n Again, Cicero\u2019s Academica priora,\nII.xxix.95\u2013xxx.97, contains a fairly clear formulation:\n\n\nIf you lie and speak that truth [namely, that you lie], are you lying\nor speaking the truth? \u2026 If you say you lie, and you speak the\ntruth, you lie; but you say you lie, and you speak the truth;\ntherefore, you lie.\n\n\nBut this passage is never cited in the\ninsolubilia-literature. Moreover Cicero, who wrote in Latin\nand so did not have to be translated to be available to the Middle\nAges, calls such paradoxes \u201cinexplicables\u201d\n(inexplicabilia). If he was the catalyst for the medieval\ndiscussions, we would have expected to find that term in the\ninsolubilia-literature, and we do not; the unanimous medieval\nterm is \u2018insolubles\u2019.\n",
