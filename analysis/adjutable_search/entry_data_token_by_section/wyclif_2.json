    "main_text": "Logic || Some preliminary remarks\n2.1 Some preliminary remarks\n\nLate medieval Nominalists, like Ockham and his followers, drew a\ndistinction between things as they exist in the extra-mental world and\nthe schemata by means of which we think of and talk about them. While\nthe world consists only of two genera of individuals, substances and\nqualities, the concepts by which they are grasped and expressed are\nuniversal and of ten different types. Nor do the relations through\nwhich we connect our notions in a proposition analytically correspond\nto the real links that join individuals in a state of affairs. Thus,\nour conceptual forms do not coincide with the elements and structures\nof reality, and our knowledge does not reproduce its objects but\nmerely regards them.\n\nWyclif maintained that such an approach to philosophical questions was\nmisleading and deleterious. Many times in his works he expressed the\ndeepest hostility to such a tendency. He thought that only on the\nbasis of a close isomorphism between language and the world could the\nsignifying power of terms and statements, the possibility of\ndefinitions, and finally the validity and universality of our\nknowledge be explained and ensured. So the nucleus of his metaphysics\nlies in his trust in the scheme object-label as the\ngeneral interpretative key of every logico-epistemological problem. He\nfirmly believed that language was an ordered collection of signs, each\nreferring to one of the constitutive elements of reality, and that\ntrue (linguistic) propositions were like pictures of those\nelements\u2019 inner structures or/and mutual relationships. From\nthis point of view, universals are conceived of as the real essences\ncommon to many individual things, which are necessary conditions for\nour language to be significant. Wyclif thought that by associating\ncommon terms with such universal realities the fact could be accounted\nfor that each common term can stand for many things at once and can\nlabel all of them in the same way.\n\nThis conviction explains the main characteristic of his philosophical\nstyle, to which all his contributions can be traced back: a strong\npropensity towards hypostatisation. Wyclif methodically replaces\nlogical and epistemological rules with ontological criteria and\nreferences. He thought of logic as turning on structural forms,\nindependent of both their semantic contents and the mental acts by\nwhich they are grasped. It is through these forms that the network\nconnecting the basic constituents of the world (individuals and\nuniversals, substances and accidents, concrete properties, like\nbeing-white, and abstract forms, like whiteness) is disclosed to us.\nHis peculiar analysis of predication and his own formulation of the\nScotistic formal distinction are logically necessary requirements of\nthis philosophical approach. They are two absolute novelties in late\nmedieval philosophy, and certainly the most important of\nWyclif\u2019s contributions to the thought of his times.\n\nWyclif\u2019s last formulation of the theory of difference and his\ntheory of universals and predication are linked together, and rest\nupon a sort of componential analysis where things substitute for\nlexemes and ontological properties substitute for semantic features.\nWithin Wyclif\u2019s world, difference (or distinction) is defined in\nterms of partial identity, and is the main kind of transcendental\nrelation holding among the world\u2019s objects, since in virtue of\nits metaphysical composition everything is at the same time partially\nidentical to and different from any other. When the objects at issue\nare categorial items, and among what differentiates them is their own\nindividual being, the objects differ essentially. If the\nobjects share the same individual being and what differentiates them\nis (at least) one of their concrete metaphysical components\n(or features), then the objects differ really, whereas if\nwhat differentiates them is one of their abstract\nmetaphysical components, then they differ formally. Formal\ndistinction is therefore the tool by means of which the dialectic of\none-many internal to the world\u2019s objects is regulated. It\nexplains why one and the same thing is at the same time an atomic\nstate of affairs and how many different beings can constitute just one\nthing.\n",
