    "main_text": "Life and Works\n1. Life and Works\n\nLucius Annaeus Seneca (c. 1 BCE \u2013 CE 65) was born in Corduba\n(Spain) and educated\u2014in rhetoric and philosophy\u2014in Rome.\nSeneca had a highly successful, and quite dramatic, political career.\nEven a brief (and by necessity incomplete) list of events in his life\nindicates that Seneca had ample occasion for reflection on violent\nemotions, the dangers of ambition, and the ways in which the life of\npolitics differs from the life of philosophy\u2014among the topics\npursued in his writings. He was accused of adultery with the Emperor\nCaligula\u2019s sister and therefore exiled to Corsica in 41; having\nbeen Nero\u2019s \u201ctutor\u201d in his adolescent years, he was\namong Nero\u2019s advisors after his accession in 54; Seneca\ncontinued to be an advisor in times that became increasingly difficult\nfor anyone in the close proximity of Nero, in spite of requests from\nhis side to be granted permission to retire; he was charged with\ncomplicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to murder Nero, and compelled to\ncommit suicide in 65 (on Seneca\u2019s life, see Griffin 1992;\nMaurach 2000; Veyne 2003; Wilson 2014; Romm 2014; on his perspective\non Nero, see Braund 2009).\n\nSeneca\u2019s philosophical writings have often been interpreted with\nan eye to his biography: how could his discussions of the healing\npowers of philosophy not reflect his own life? However, as personal as\nSeneca\u2019s style often is, his writings are not autobiographical\n(Edwards 1997). Seneca creates a literary persona for himself. He\ndiscusses the questions that occupy him in a way that invites his\nreaders to think about issues in their own life, rather than in\nSeneca\u2019s life.\n\nThe writings that we shall primarily be concerned with are: the\nMoral Letters to Lucilius (Ad Lucilium epistulae\nmorales), the Moral Essays\n(\u2018dialogi\u2019 or dialogues is the somewhat\nmisleading title given in our principal manuscript, the Codex\nAmbrosianus, to the twelve books making up ten of these works,\nincluding three \u201cconsolatory\u201d writings; among the\nEssays are two further works that came down to us in other\nmanuscripts), and the Natural Questions (Naturales\nquaestiones) (on the full range of Seneca\u2019s writings, see\nVolk and Williams 2006, \u201cIntroduction,\u201d and Ker 2006; a\ncomprehensive overview, with individual chapters on specific writings\nand themes, is offered in Heil and Damschen 2014).\n\nA brief note is in order here on the relative chronology of\nSeneca\u2019s works, which is hard to establish given that we know so\nlittle about Seneca\u2019s life apart from his imperial service, as\nnoted above, and its consequences. The Consolation to Marcia\nis probably the earliest surviving piece of Seneca\u2019s work.\nSimilarly, the Consolation to His Mother Helvia and the\nConsolation to Polybius are considered early (perhaps dating\nto 43 or 44), the former actually being composed on the occasion of\nSeneca\u2019s banishment to Corsica. All other surviving works seem\nto be written later, mostly after Seneca\u2019s return to Rome in 49\nfrom his Corsican exile. Among the Moral Essays, the only one\nwe can date with some certainty is On Mercy, an essay in\nwhich Seneca directly addresses Nero in the early days of his reign\n(55 or 56). The Moral Letters to Lucilius as well as the\nNatural Questions are the product of the last years of\nSeneca\u2019s life, the brief period (62\u201365) that Seneca spent\nin retirement before following Nero\u2019s order to commit suicide\n(on the dating of Seneca\u2019s writings see the introductions in\nCooper/Procop\u00e9 1995, and Griffin 1992).\n\nIn the Imperial Period, Stoicism had significant influence on Roman\nliterature, and Seneca\u2019s tragedies are of particular interest\nhere. In Seneca\u2019s case, we do not see a poet appropriating or\nintegrating Stoic ideas, but actually a Stoic philosopher writing\npoetry himself. The precise way in which Seneca\u2019s Stoicism is\nrelevant to his tragedies is controversial. Traditionally scholars\ndebated whether and why a philosopher like Seneca would write poetry\nat all\u2014to some this seemed so unlikely that prior to Erasmus it\nwas thought that there were two \u2018Senecas,\u2019 the philosopher\nand the tragedian (cf. Fantham 1982, 15). Today it is widely assumed\nthat some of the themes in Seneca\u2019s tragedies are at least\nrelated to his philosophical views. Seneca\u2019s interest in ethics\nand psychology\u2014first and foremost perhaps the destructive\neffects of excessive emotion\u2014seems to figure in his plays, and\nperhaps his natural philosophy plays an equally important role (cf.\nFantham 1982, 15\u201319; Fischer 2014; Gill 2003, 56\u201358;\nRosenmeyer 1989; Schiesaro 2003; Volk 2006; on the range of\nSeneca\u2019s writings, see Volk and Williams 2006). In this article,\nwe do not consider his tragedies, but only his prose writings. Some\nrecent work on Seneca suggests that one should see his prose writings\nand his tragedies as complementary sides of his thought (Wray 2009).\nThe tragedies are arguably darker than the prose writings, and topics\non which Seneca seems to have a consoling philosophical view are\nexplored in rather less consoling ways. For example, death is seen as\na liberation in Seneca\u2019s philosophical writings. But in the\ntragedies, death can appear as a transition to even greater\nsufferings, or, equally bad, the dead seem to demand ever new deaths,\nto provide them with fresh companions in the underworld (Busch\n2009).\n",
