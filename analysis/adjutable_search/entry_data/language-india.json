    "preamble": "\n\nSpeculations about the nature and function of language in India can be\ntraced to its earliest period. These speculations are multi-faceted in\nthat one detects many different strands of thought regarding language.\nSome of these speculations are about what one may call the principle\nof language, but others are about specific languages or specific uses\nof these languages. One sees speculations regarding the creation of\nlanguage as well as the role of language in the creation of the\nuniverse. Language appears in relation to gods as well as humans, and\noccupies the entire width of a spectrum from being a divinity herself\nto being a means used by gods to create and control the world, and\nultimately to being a means in the hands of the human beings to\nachieve their own religious as well as mundane purposes. Gradually, a\nwhole range of questions are raised about all these various aspects of\nlanguage in the evolving religious and philosophical traditions in\nIndia, traditions which shared some common conceptions, but thrived in\nfull-blooded disagreements on major issues. Such disagreements relate\nto the ontological nature of language, its communicative role, the\nnature of meaning, and more specifically the nature of word-meaning\nand sentence-meaning. On the other hand, certain manifestations of\nlanguage, whether in the form of specific languages like Sanskrit or\nparticular scriptural texts like the Vedas, became topics of\ncontestation between various philosophical and religious traditions.\nFinally, one must mention the epistemic role and value of language,\nits ability or inability to provide veridical knowledge about the\nworld. In what follows, I intend to provide a brief account of these\ndiverse developments in ancient, classical and medieval India. (For an\napproximate chronology of Indian philosophers, see the\n supplement.)\n",

    "main_text": "\n1. Pre-systematic conceptions of language in Vedic texts\n\nThe Vedic scriptural texts (1500\u2013500 bce)\nconsist of the four ancient collections, i.e.,\nthe \u1e5agveda, the S\u0101maveda, the\nYajurveda, and the Atharvaveda. The next layer of\nVedic texts, the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, consists of prose\nritual commentaries that offer procedures, justifications, and\nexplanations. The last two categories of Vedic literature are the\n\u0100ra\u1e47yakas, \u201cForest Texts\u201d, and the\nUpani\u1e63ads, \u201cSecret Mystical Doctrines\u201d.\n\nThe word sa\u1e43sk\u1e5bta is not known as a label of a\nlanguage variety during the Vedic period. The general term used for\nlanguage in the Vedic texts is v\u0101k, a word historically\nrelated to \u201cvoice\u201d. The Vedic poet-sages perceived\nsignificant differences between their own language and the languages\nof the outsiders. Similarly, they perceived important differences\nbetween their own use of language in mundane contexts and the use of\nlanguage directed toward Gods. The Gods are generically referred to by\nthe term deva, and the language of the hymns is said to be\ndev\u012b v\u0101k, \u201cdivine language.\u201d\nThis language is believed to have been created by the Gods themselves.\nThe language thus created by the Gods is then spoken by the animate\nworld in various forms. The divine language in its ultimate form is so\nmysterious that three-quarters of it are said to be hidden from the\nhumans who have access only to a quarter of it. The Vedic poet-sages\nsay that this divine language enters into their hearts and that they\ndiscover it through mystical introspection. Just as the language used\nby the Vedic poet-sages is the divine language, the language used by\nthe non-Vedic people is said to be un-godly (adev\u012b) or\ndemonic (asury\u0101).\n\nIn the Vedic literature, one observes the development of mystical and\nritual approaches to language. Language was perceived as an essential\ntool for approaching the gods, invoking them, asking their favors, and\nthus for the successful completion of a ritual performance. While the\nGods were the powers that finally yielded the wishes of their human\nworshipers, one could legitimately look at the resulting reward as\nensuing from the power of the religious language, or the power of the\nperforming priest. This way, the language came to be looked upon as\nhaving mysterious creative powers, and as a divine power that needed\nto be propitiated before it could be successfully used to invoke other\ngods. This approach to language ultimately led to deification of\nlanguage and the emergence of the Goddess of Speech (v\u0101k\ndev\u012b), and a number of other gods who are called\n\u201cLord of Speech\u201d (brahma\u1e47aspati,\nb\u1e5bhaspati, v\u0101kpati).\n\nIn contrast with the valorous deeds of the divine language, the\nlanguage of the non-Vedic people neither yields fruit nor blossom\n(\u1e5agveda, 10.71.5). \u201cYielding fruit and\nblossom\u201d is a phrase indicative of the creative power of speech\nthat produces the rewards for the worshiper. From being a created but\ndivine entity, the speech rises to the heights of being a divinity in\nher own right and eventually to becoming the substratum of the\nexistence of the whole universe. The deification of speech is seen in\nhymn 10.125 of the \u1e5agveda where the Goddess of Speech\nsings her own glory. In this hymn, one no longer hears of the creation\nof the speech, but one begins to see the speech as a primordial\ndivinity that creates and controls other gods, sages, and the human\nbeings. Here the goddess of speech demands worship in her own right,\nbefore her powers may be used for other purposes. The mystery of\nlanguage is comprehensible only to a special class of people, the wise\nBr\u0101hma\u1e47as, while the commoners have access to and\nunderstanding of only a limited portion of this transcendental\nphenomenon.\n\nThe \u201cLord of Speech\u201d divinities typically emerge as\ncreator divinities, e.g., Brahm\u0101,\nB\u1e5bhaspati, and Brahma\u1e47aspati, and the\nword brahman which earlier refers, with differing accents, to\nthe creative incantation and the priest, eventually comes to assume in\nthe Upani\u1e63ads the meaning of the creative force behind\nthe entire universe. While the Vedic hymns were looked upon as being\ncrafted by particular poet-sages in the earlier period, gradually a\nrising perception of their mysterious power and their preservation by\nthe successive generations led to the emergence of a new conception of\nthe scriptural texts. Already in the late parts of the\n\u1e5agveda (10.90.9), we hear that the verses\n(\u1e5bk), the songs (s\u0101ma), and the ritual\nformulas (yajus) arose from the primordial sacrifice offered\nby the gods. They arose from the sacrificed body of the cosmic person,\nthe ultimate ground of existence. This tendency of increasingly\nlooking at the scriptural texts as not being produced by any human\nauthors takes many forms in subsequent religious and philosophical\nmaterials, finally leading to a wide-spread notion that the Vedas are\nnot authored by any human beings (apauru\u1e63eya), and are\nin fact uncreated and eternal, beyond the cycles of creation and\ndestruction of the world. In late Vedic texts, we hear the notion that\nthe real Vedas are infinite (ananta) and that the Vedas known\nto human poet-sages are a mere fraction of the real infinite\nVedas.\n\nIn the late Vedic traditions of the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as, we\nare told that there is perfection of the ritual form\n(r\u016bpasam\u1e5bddhi) when a recited incantation echoes\nthe ritual action that is being performed. This shows a notion that\nideally there should be a match between the contents of a ritual\nformula and the ritual action in which it is recited, further\nsuggesting a notion that language mirrors the external world in some\nway. In the \u0100ra\u1e47yakas and\nUpani\u1e63ads, language acquires importance in different\nways. The Upani\u1e63ads, emphasizing the painful nature of\ncycles of rebirths, point out that the ideal goal should be to put an\nend to these cycles of birth and rebirth and to find one\u2019s permanent\nidentity with the original ground of the universal existence, i.e.,\nBrahman. The term brahman, originally referring to\ncreative ritual chants and the chanters, has now acquired this new\nmeaning, the ultimate creative force behind the universe. As part of\nthe meditative practice, one is asked to focus on the sacred syllable\nOM, which is the symbolic linguistic representation of Brahman. Here\nthe language, in the form of OM, becomes an important tool for the\nattainment of one\u2019s mystical union with Brahman. The Sanskrit word\nak\u1e63ara refers to a syllable, but it also means\n\u201cindestructible.\u201d Thus, the word ak\u1e63ara\nallowed the meditational use of the holy syllable OM to ultimately\nlead to one\u2019s experiential identity with the indestructible reality of\nBrahman.\n\nThe role of language and scripture in the Upani\u1e63adic mode of\nreligious life is complicated. Here, the use of language to invoke the\nVedic gods becomes a lower form of religious practice. Can Brahman be\nreached through language? Since Brahman is beyond all\ncharacterizations and all modes of human perception, no linguistic\nexpression can properly describe it. Hence all linguistic expressions\nand all knowledge framed in language are deemed to be inadequate for\nthe purpose of reaching Brahman. In fact, it is silence that\ncharacterizes Brahman, and not words. Even so, the use of OM-focused\nmeditation is emphasized, at least in the pre-final stages of\nBrahman-realization.\n\nBy the time we come to the classical philosophical systems in India,\none more assumption is made by almost all Hindu systems, i.e., that\nall the Vedas together form a coherent whole. The human authorship of\nthe Vedic texts has long been rejected, and they are now perceived\neither as being entirely uncreated and eternal or created by God at\nthe beginning of each cycle of creation. Under the assumption that\nthey are entirely uncreated, their innate ability to convey truthful\nmeaning is unhampered by human limitations. Thus if all the Vedic\ntexts convey truth, there cannot be any internal contradictions. If an\nomniscient God, who by his very nature is compassionate and beyond\nhuman limitations, created the Vedas, one reaches the same conclusion,\ni.e., there cannot be any internal contradictions. The traditional\ninterpretation of the Vedas proceeds under these assumptions. If there\nare seeming contradictions in Vedic passages, the burden of finding\nways to remove those seeming contradictions is upon the interpreter,\nbut there can be no admission of internal contradictions in the texts\nthemselves.\n2. Conception of Language among Sanskrit grammarians\n\nBefore the emergence of the formalized philosophical systems or the\ndar\u015banas, we see a number of philosophical issues\nrelating to language implicitly and explicitly brought out by the\nearly Sanskrit grammarians, namely P\u0101\u1e47ini,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali. P\u0101\u1e47ini (400 bce)\ncomposed his grammar of Sanskrit with a certain\nnotion of Sanskrit as an atemporal language. For him, there were\nregional dialects of Sanskrit, as well as variation of usage in its\nscriptural (chandas) and contemporary\n(bh\u0101\u1e63\u0101) domains. All these domains are\ntreated as sub-domains of a unified language, which is not restricted\nby any temporality.\n\nPata\u00f1jali\u2019s Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya refers to the\nviews of Vy\u0101\u1e0di and V\u0101japy\u0101yana on the meaning of\nwords. Vy\u0101\u1e0di argued that words like \u201ccow\u201d\ndenote individual instances of a certain class, while\nV\u0101japy\u0101yana argued that words like \u201ccow\u201d denote\ngeneric properties or class properties (\u0101k\u1e5bti),\nsuch as cowness, that are shared by all members of certain classes.\nPata\u00f1jali presents a long debate on the extreme positions in\nthis argument, and finally concludes that both the individual\ninstances and the class property must be included within the range of\nmeaning. The only difference between the two positions is about which\naspect, the individual or the class property, is denoted first, and\nwhich is understood subsequently. This early debate indicates\nphilosophical positions that get expanded and fully argued in the\ntraditions of the Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nand the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas.\n\nThe early commentators on P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar from the late\nMauryan and post-Mauryan periods, K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali (200\u2013100 bce), display\na significant reorganization of Brahmanical views in the face of\nopposition from Jains and Buddhists. For K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali, the Sanskrit language at large is sacred like the\nVedas. The intelligent use of Sanskrit, backed by the explicit\nunderstanding of its grammar, leads to prosperity here and in the next\nworld, as do the Vedas. K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali admit\nthat vernaculars as well as Sanskrit could do the function of\ncommunicating meaning. However, only the usage of Sanskrit produces\nreligious merit. This is an indirect criticism of the Jains and the\nBuddhists, who used vernacular languages for the propagation of their\nfaiths. The grammarians did not accept the religious value of the\nvernaculars. The vernacular languages, along with the incorrect uses\nof Sanskrit, are all lumped together by the Sanskrit grammarians under\nthe derogatory terms apa\u015babda and\napabhra\u1e43\u015ba, both of which suggest a view that the\nvernaculars are degenerate or \u201cfallen\u201d forms of the divine\nlanguage, i.e., Sanskrit. K\u0101ty\u0101yana says: \u201cWhile the\nrelationship between words and meanings is established on the basis of\nthe usage of specific words to denote specific meanings in the\ncommunity of speakers, the science of grammar only makes a regulation\nconcerning the religious merit produced by the linguistic usage, as is\ncommonly done in worldly matters and in Vedic rituals\u201d (first\nV\u0101rttika on the\nA\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b). K\u0101ty\u0101yana\nrefers to these \u201cdegenerate\u201d vernacular usages as being\ncaused by the inability of the low-class speakers to speak proper\nSanskrit. The grammarians tell the story of demons that used improper\ndegenerate usages during their ritual and hence were defeated.\n\nThe relationship between Sanskrit words and their meanings is said to\nbe established (siddha) and taken as given by the\ngrammarians. Pata\u00f1jali understands this statement of\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana to mean that the relationship between Sanskrit\nwords and their meanings is eternal (nitya), not created\n(k\u0101rya) by anyone. Since this eternal relationship,\naccording to these grammarians, exists only for Sanskrit words and\ntheir meanings, one cannot accord the same status to the vernaculars,\nwhich are born of an inability on the part of their speakers to speak\nproper Sanskrit.\n\nWhile P\u0101\u1e47ini uses the term prak\u1e5bti to refer\nto the derivationally original state of a word or expression before\nchanges effected by grammatical operations are applied,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali use the term\nvik\u1e5bta to refer to the derivationally transformed\nsegment. However, change and identity are not compatible within more\nrigid metaphysical frameworks, and this becomes apparent in the\nfollowing discussion. In his V\u0101rttikas or comments on\nP\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s grammar, K\u0101ty\u0101yana says that one could\nhave argued that an item partially transformed does not yet lose its\nidentity (V\u0101rttika 10 on P. 1.1.56). But such an\nacceptance would lead to non-eternality (anityatva) of\nlanguage (V\u0101rttika 11,\nMah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, p. 136), and that is not\nacceptable. Pata\u00f1jali asserts that words in reality are eternal\n(nitya), and that means they must be absolutely free from\nchange or transformation and fixed in their nature. If words are truly\neternal, one cannot then say that a word was transformed and is yet\nthe same. This points to the emerging ideological shifts in\nphilosophical traditions, which make their headway into the tradition\nof grammar, and finally lead to the development of newer conceptions\nwithin the tradition of grammar and elsewhere.\n\nIn trying to figure out how the emerging doctrine of nityatva\n(\u201cpermanence\u201d, \u201cimmutability\u201d) of language\ncauses problems with the notion of transformation\n(vik\u0101ra) and how these problems are eventually answered\nby developing new concepts, we should note two issues, i.e., temporal\nfixity or flexibility of individual sounds, and the compatibility of\nthe notion of sequence of sounds, or utterance as a process stretched\nin time. From within the new paradigm of nityatva or\neternality of sounds, K\u0101ty\u0101yana concludes that the true\nsounds (var\u1e47a) are fixed in their nature in spite of\nthe difference of speed of delivery (V\u0101rttika 5 on P.\n1.1.70, Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, p. 181). The speed of\ndelivery (v\u1e5btti) results from the slow or fast\nutterance of a speaker (vacana), though the true sounds are\npermanently fixed in their nature. Here, K\u0101ty\u0101yana broaches\na doctrine that is later developed further by Pata\u00f1jali, and\nmore fully by Bhart\u1e5bhari. It argues for a dual ontology. There\nare the fixed true sounds (var\u1e47a), and then there are\nthe uttered sounds (vacana, \u201cutterance\u201d). It is\nPata\u00f1jali who uses, for the first time as far as we know, the\nterm spho\u1e6da to refer to K\u0101ty\u0101yana\u2019s\n\u201ctrue sounds which are fixed\u201d (avasthit\u0101\nvar\u1e47\u0101\u1e25) and the term dhvani\n(\u201cuttered sounds\u201d). Pata\u00f1jali adds an important\ncomment to K\u0101ty\u0101yana\u2019s discussion. He says that the real\nsound (\u015babda) is thus the spho\u1e6da\n(\u201cthe sound as it initially breaks out into the open\u201d),\nand the quality [length or speed] of the sound is part of\ndhvani (\u201csound as it continues\u201d)\n(Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya, I, p. 181). The term\nspho\u1e6da refers to something like exploding or coming\ninto being in a bang. Thus it refers to the initial production or\nperception of sound. On the other hand, the stretching of that sound\nseems to refer to the dimension of continuation. Pata\u00f1jali\nmeans to say that it is the same sound, but it may remain audible for\ndifferent durations.\n\nThis raises the next problem that the grammarians must face: can a\nword be understood as a sequence or a collection of sounds?\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana says that one cannot have a sequence or a\ncollection of sounds, because the process of speech proceeds\nsound-by-sound, and that sounds perish as soon as they are uttered.\nThus, one cannot have two sounds co-existing at a given moment to\nrelate to each other. Since the sounds perish as soon as they are\nuttered, a sound cannot have another co-existent companion\n(V\u0101rttikas 9 and 10 on P. 1.4.109). K\u0101ty\u0101yana\npoints out all these difficulties, but it is Pata\u00f1jali who\noffers a solution to this philosophical dilemma. Pata\u00f1jali\nsuggests that one can pull together impressions of all the uttered\nsounds and then think of a sequence in this mentally constructed image\nof a word (Mah\u0101bha\u1e63ya, I, p. 356). Elsewhere,\nPata\u00f1jali says that a word is perceived through the auditory\norgan, discerned through one\u2019s intelligence, and brought into being\nthrough its utterance (Mah\u0101bha\u1e63ya, I, p. 18).\nWhile Pata\u00f1jali\u2019s solution overcomes the transitoriness of the\nuttered sounds, and the resulting impossibility of a sequence, there\nis no denial of sequentiality or perhaps of an imprint of\nsequentiality in the comprehended word, and there is indeed no claim\nto its absolutely unitary or partless character. Pata\u00f1jali\nmeans to provide a solution to the perception of sequentiality through\nhis ideas of a mental storage of comprehension. But at the same time,\nthis mental storage and the ability to view this mental image allows\none to overcome the difficulty of non-simultaneity and construct a\nword or a linguistic unit as a collection of perceived sounds or\nwords, as the case may be. K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali\nspecifically admit the notion of samud\u0101ya\n(\u201ccollection\u201d) of sounds to represent a word and a\ncollection of words to represent a phrase or a sentence\n(V\u0101rttika 7 on P. 2.2.29). Thus, while the ontology of\nphysical sounds does not permit their co-existence, their mental\nimages do allow it, and once they can be perceived as components of a\ncollection, one also recognizes the imprint of the sequence in which\nthey were perceived. Neither K\u0101ty\u0101yana nor Pata\u00f1jali\nexplicitly claim any higher ontological status to these word-images.\nHowever, the very acceptance of such word-images opens up numerous\nexplanatory possibilities.\n\nAlthough K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali argue that the\nnotion of change or transformation of parts of words was contradictory\nto the doctrine of nityatva (\u201cpermanence\u201d) of\nlanguage, they were not averse to the notion of substitution. The\nnotion of substitution was understood as a substitution, not of a part\nof a word by another part, but of a whole word by another word, and\nthis especially as a conceptual rather than an ontological\nreplacement. Thus, in going from \u201cbhavati\u201d to\n\u201cbhavatu\u201d, P\u0101\u1e47ini prescribes the\nchange of \u201ci\u201d of \u201cti\u201d to\n\u201cu\u201d (cf. P.3.4.86: \u201cer\nu\u1e25\u201d). Thus, \u201ci\u201d changes to\n\u201cu\u201d, leading to the change of\n\u201cti\u201d to \u201ctu\u201d, and this\nconsequently leads to the change of \u201cbhavati\u201d to\n\u201cbhavatu\u201d. For K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali, the above atomistic and transformational\nunderstanding of P\u0101\u1e47ini\u2019s procedure goes contrary to the\ndoctrine of nityatva (\u201cpermanence\u201d) of words.\nTherefore, they suggest that it is actually the substitution of the\nwhole word \u201cbhavati\u201d by another whole word\n\u201cbhavatu\u201d, each of these two words being eternal\nin its own right. Additionally they assert that this is merely a\nnotional change and not an ontological change, i.e., a certain item is\nfound to occur, where one expected something else to occur. There is\nno change of an item x into an item y, nor does one\nremove the item x and place y in its place\n(V\u0101rttikas 12 and 14 on P. 1.1.56). This discussion\nseems to imply a sort of unitary character to the words, whether\nnotional or otherwise, and this eventually leads to a movement toward\na kind of\nakha\u1e47\u1e0da-pada-v\u0101da\n(\u201cthe doctrine of partless words\u201d) in the\nV\u0101kyapad\u012bya of Bhart\u1e5bhari. While one must\nadmit that the seeds for such a conception may be traced in these\ndiscussions in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya,\nPata\u00f1jali is actually not arguing so much against words having\nparts, as against the notion of change or transformation\n(Mah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya on P. 1.2.20, I, p. 75).\n\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali clearly view words as\ncollections of sounds. Besides using the term\n\u201csamud\u0101ya\u201d for such a collection, they also\nuse the word \u201cvar\u1e47asa\u1e43gh\u0101ta\u201d\n(\u201ccollection of sounds\u201d). They argue that words are built\nby putting together sounds, and that, while the words are meaningful,\nthe component sounds are not meaningful in themselves. The notion of a\nword as a collection (sa\u1e43gh\u0101ta) applies not only\nin the sense that it is a collection of sounds, but also in the sense\nthat complex formations are collections of smaller morphological\ncomponents.\n\nThis leads us to consider the philosophical developments in the\nthought of Bhart\u1e5bhari (400 ce), and\nespecially his departures from the conceptions seen in\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali. Apart from his significant\ncontribution toward an in depth philosophical understanding of issues\nof the structure and function of language, and issues of phonology,\nsemantics and syntax, Bhart\u1e5bhari is well known for his claim\nthat language constitutes the ultimate principle of reality\n(\u015babdabrahman). Both the signifier words and the\nsignified entities in the world are perceived to be a transformation\n(pari\u1e47\u0101ma) of the ultimate unified principle of\nlanguage.\n\nFor K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali, the level of\npadas (\u201cinflected words\u201d) is the basic level of\nlanguage for grammar. These words are freely combined by the users to\nform sentences or phrases. The words are not derived by\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali by abstracting them from\nsentences by using the method of anvaya-vyatireka\n(\u201cconcurrent occurrence and concurrent absence\u201d)\n(V\u0101rttika 9 on P. 1.2.45). On the other hand, they claim\nthat a grammarian first derives stems and affixes by applying the\nprocedure of abstraction to words, and then in turn puts these stems\nand affixes through the grammatical process of derivation\n(sa\u1e43sk\u0101ra) to build the words. Here,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali do make a distinction between\nthe levels of actual usage (vacana) and technical grammatical\nanalysis and derivation. While full-fledged words (pada)\noccur at the level of usage, their abstracted morphological components\ndo not occur by themselves at that level. However, they do not seem to\nsuggest that the stems, roots, and affixes are purely imagined\n(kalpita).\n\nBhart\u1e5bhari has substantially moved beyond K\u0101ty\u0101yana\nand Pata\u00f1jali. For him, the linguistically given entity is a\nsentence. Everything below the level of sentence is derived through a\nmethod of abstraction referred to by the term\nanvaya-vyatireka or apoddh\u0101ra.\nAdditionally, for Bhart\u1e5bhari, elements abstracted through this\nprocedure have no reality of any kind. They are kalpita\n(\u201cimagined\u201d) (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, III, 14,\n75\u201376). Such abstracted items have instructional value for those\nwho do not yet have any intuitive insight into the true nature of\nspeech (V\u0101kyapad\u012bya, II. 238). The true speech\nunit, the sentence, is an undivided singularity and so is its meaning\nwhich is comprehended in an instantaneous cognitive flash\n(pratibh\u0101), rather than through a deliberative and/or\nsequential process. Consider the following verse of the\nV\u0101kyapad\u012bya (II.10):\n\nJust as stems, affixes etc. are abstracted from a given word, so the\nabstraction of words from a sentence is justified.\n\n\nHere, the clause introduced by \u201cjust as\u201d refers to the\nolder more widely prevalent view seen in the\nMah\u0101bh\u0101\u1e63ya. With the word \u201cso,\u201d\nBhart\u1e5bhari is proposing an analogical extension of the procedure\nof abstraction (apoddh\u0101ra) to the level of a\nsentence.\n\nWithout mentioning Pata\u00f1jali or K\u0101ty\u0101yana by name,\nBhart\u1e5bhari seems to critique their view that the meaning of a\nsentence, consisting of the interrelations between the meanings of\nindividual words, is essentially not derived from the constituent\nwords themselves, but from the whole sentence as a collection of\nwords. The constituent words convey their meaning first, but their\ninterrelations are not communicated by the words themselves, but by\nthe whole sentence as a unit. This view of K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali is criticized by Bhart\u1e5bhari\n(V\u0101kyapad\u012bya II.15\u201316, 41\u201342). It is\nclear that Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s ideas do not agree with the views\nexpressed by K\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali, and that the\nviews of these two earlier grammarians are much closer, though not\nidentical, with the views later maintained by the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas and M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas. For\nBhart\u1e5bhari, the sentence as a single partless unit conveys its\nentire unitary meaning in a flash, and this unitary meaning as well as\nthe unitary sentence are subsequently analyzed by grammarians into\ntheir assumed or imagined constituents.\n\nFinally, we should note that Bhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s views on the unitary\ncharacter of a sentence and its meaning were found to be generally\nunacceptable by the schools of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nand Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, as well as by\nthe later grammarian-philosophers like\nKau\u1e47\u1e0dabha\u1e6d\u1e6da and\nN\u0101ge\u015babha\u1e6d\u1e6da. Their discussion of the\ncomprehension of sentence-meaning is not couched in terms of\nBhart\u1e5bhari\u2019s instantaneous flash of intuition\n(pratibh\u0101), but in terms of the conditions of\n\u0101k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63\u0101 (\u201cmutual\nexpectancy\u201d), yogyat\u0101\n(\u201ccompatibility)\u201d, and \u0101satti\n(\u201ccontiguity of words\u201d). In this sense, the later\ngrammarian-philosophers are somewhat closer to the spirit of\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali.\n3. General philosophical approaches to the status of Vedic scriptures\n\nEarly Vedic notions about the authorship of the Vedic hymns are\ndifferent from philosophical views. Vedic hymns use words like\nk\u0101ru (\u201ccraftsman\u201d) to describe the poet, and\nthe act of producing a hymn is described as (\u1e5agveda\n10.71.2): \u201cLike cleansing barley with a sieve, the wise poets\ncreated the speech with their mind\u201d. The poets of the Vedic\nhymns are also called mantrak\u1e5bt (\u201cmakers of\nhymns\u201d). Further, each hymn of the Veda is associated with a\nspecific poet-priest and often with a family of poet-priests. But,\nalready in the \u1e5agveda, there are signs of the beginning\nof an impersonal conception of the origin of the Vedas. For instance,\nthe famous Puru\u1e63a-hymn of the \u1e5agveda\ndescribes the hymns of the \u1e5agveda, the formulae of\nYajus and the songs of S\u0101man as originating from the primordial\nsacrifice of the cosmic being (\u1e5agveda 10.90.9). This\ntrend to ascribe impersonal origin to the Vedas gets further\naccentuated in the Br\u0101hma\u1e47as and the\nUpani\u1e63ads.\n\nLater Hindu notions about the Vedic scriptures and their authority are\nin part reflections of Hindu responses to the criticisms of the Vedas\nlaunched by the Buddhists and the Jains. The early Buddhist critique\nof the Vedas targets the authors of the Vedic hymns. Vedic sages like\nVasi\u1e63\u1e6dha, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra, and Bh\u1e5bgu are\ndescribed as the ancient authors of the mantras\n(por\u0101\u1e47\u0101 mant\u0101na\u1e43\nkatt\u0101ro), but they are criticized as being ignorant of\nthe true path to the union with Brahm\u0101 (Tevijjasutta;\nD\u012bghanik\u0101ya; Suttapi\u1e6daka). So the\nVedas are depicted as being words of ignorant human beings who do not\neven recognize their own ignorance. How can one trust such authors or\ntheir words? The Buddhist and the Jain traditions also rejected the\nnotion of God, and hence any claim that the Vedas were words of God,\nand hence authoritative, was not acceptable to them. On the other\nhand, the Jain and the Buddhist traditions claimed that their leading\nspiritual teachers like Mah\u0101v\u012bra and Buddha were omniscient\n(sarvaj\u00f1a) and were compassionate toward humanity at\nlarge, and hence their words were claimed to be authoritative.\n\nBeginning around 200 bce, Hindu ritualists\n(M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas) and logicians\n(Naiy\u0101yikas and Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas) began to\ndefend their religious faith in the Vedas and in the Brahmanical\nreligion with specific arguments. Some of these arguments have\nprecursors in the discussions of the early Sanskrit grammarians,\nK\u0101ty\u0101yana and Pata\u00f1jali. The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas accepted the arguments of the\nBuddhists and the Jains that one need not accept the notion of a\ncreator-controller God. However, the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas attempted to defend the Vedas\nagainst the criticism that the ancient human sages who authored the\nhymns of the Vedas were ignorant, while the figures like the Buddha\nand Mah\u0101v\u012bra were omniscient. They contested the notion of\nan omniscient person (sarvaj\u00f1a), and argued that no\nhumans could be omniscient and free from ignorance, passion, and\ndeceit. Therefore, the Buddha and Mah\u0101v\u012bra could not be free\nfrom these faults either, and hence their words cannot be trusted. On\nthe other hand, the Vedas were claimed to be eternal and intrinsically\nmeaningful words, uncreated by any human being\n(apauru\u1e63eya). Since they were not created by human\nbeings, they were free from the limitations and faults of human\nbeings. Yet the Vedas were meaningful, because the relationship\nbetween words and meanings was claimed to be innate. The Vedas were\nultimately seen as ordaining the performance of sacrifices. The\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas developed a theory of\nsentence-meaning which claimed that the meaning of a sentence centers\naround some specific action denoted by a verb-root and an injunction\nexpressed by the verbal terminations. Thus, language, especially the\nscriptural language, primarily orders us to engage in appropriate\nactions.\n\nIn this connection, we may note that\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and other systems of Hindu\nphilosophy developed a notion of linguistic expression as one of the\nsources of authoritative knowledge\n(\u015babdapram\u0101\u1e47a), when other more basic sources\nof knowledge like sense perception (pratyak\u1e63a) and\ninference (anum\u0101na) are not available. Particularly, in\nconnection with religious duty (dharma), and heaven\n(svarga) as the promised reward, only the Veda is available\nas the source of authoritative knowledge. For\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, the Veda as a source of\nknowledge is not tainted by negative qualities like ignorance and\nmalice that could affect a normal human speaker.\n\nTo understand the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 doctrine of\nthe eternality of the Vedas, we need to note that eternality implies\nthe absence of both a beginning and an end. In Indian philosophy, two\nkinds of persistence are distinguished, namely the ever unchanging\npersistence (k\u016b\u1e6dastha-nityat\u0101), like\nthat of a rock, and the continuous and yet incessantly changing\nexistence of a stream like that of a river\n(prav\u0101ha-nityat\u0101). The persistence claimed\nfor the Vedas by the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas would appear to be of\nthe k\u016b\u1e6dastha (\u201cunchanging\npersistence\u201d) kind, while its continuous study from time\nimmemorial would be of the prav\u0101ha-nitya\n(\u201cfluid persistence\u201d) kind. Further, the meanings which\nthe words signify are natural to the words, not the result of\nconvention. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 does not think that\nthe association of a particular meaning with a word is due to\nconventions among people who introduce and give meanings to the words.\nFurther, words signify only universals. The universals are eternal.\nWords do not signify particular entities of any kind which come into\nbeing and disappear, but the corresponding universals which are\neternal and of which the transient individuals are mere instances.\nFurther, not only are the meanings eternal, the words are also\neternal. All words are eternal. If one utters the word\n\u201cchair\u201d ten times, is one uttering the same word ten\ntimes? The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas say that, if the word is not the\nsame, then it cannot have the same meaning. The word and the meaning\nboth being eternal, the relation between them also is necessarily so.\nAn important argument with which the eternality of the Vedas is\nsecured is that of the eternality of the sounds of a language. \n\nThe M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 conceives of an unbroken and\nbeginningless Vedic tradition. No man or God can be considered to be\nthe very first teacher of the Veda or the first receiver of it,\nbecause the world is beginningless. It is conceivable that, just as at\npresent, there have always been teachers teaching and students\nstudying the Veda. For the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, the Vedas are\nnot words of God. In this view, they seem to accept the Buddhist and\nthe Jain critique of the notion of God. There is no need to assume\nGod. Not only is there no need to assume that God was the author of\nthe Vedas, there is no need to assume a God at all. God is not\nrequired as a Creator, for the universe was never created. Nor is God\nrequired as the Dispenser of Justice, for karman brings its own\nfruits. And one does not need God as the author of the Vedas, since\nthey are eternal and uncreated to begin with. The \u1e5a\u1e63is,\nVedic sages, did not compose the Vedas. They merely saw them, and,\ntherefore, the scriptures are free from the taint of mortality\nimplicit in a human origin. The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101\nnotion of the authority of the authorless Veda also depends upon their\nepistemic theory, that claims that all received cognitions are\nintrinsically valid (svata\u1e25\npram\u0101\u1e47a), unless and until they are falsified by\nsubsequent cognitions of higher order.\n\nThe traditions of the Naiy\u0101yikas and the Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas\nstrongly disagreed with the views of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas\nand they developed their own distinctive conceptions of language,\nmeaning, and scriptural authority. They agreed with the\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas that the Vedas were a source of\nauthoritative knowledge\n(\u015babda-pram\u0101\u1e47a), and yet they\noffered a different set of reasons. According to them, only the words\nof a trustworthy speaker (\u0101pta) are a source of\nauthoritative knowledge. They joined the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in\narguing that no humans, including Buddha and Mah\u0101v\u012bra, are\nfree from ignorance, passion, etc., and no humans are omniscient, and\ntherefore the words of no human being could be accepted as infallible.\nHowever, they did not agree with the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas in\ntheir rejection of the notion of God. In the metaphysics of the\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika tradition, the\nnotion of God plays a central role. In defending the notion of God (as\nin the Ny\u0101yakusum\u0101\u00f1jali of Udayana), they\nclaimed that God was the only being in the universe that was\nomniscient and free from the faults of ignorance and malice. He was a\ncompassionate being. Therefore, only the words of God could be\ninfallible, and therefore be trusted. For the Naiy\u0101yikas and\nVai\u015be\u1e63ikas, the Vedas were words of God, and not the words\nof human sages about God. The human sages only received the words of\nGod in their meditative trances, but they had no authorship role.\n\nOn a different level, this argument came to mean that God only spoke\nin Sanskrit, and hence Sanskrit alone was the language of God, and\nthat it was the best means to approach God. God willfully established\na connection between each Sanskrit word and its meaning, saying\n\u201clet this word refer to this thing.\u201d Such a connection was\nnot established by God for vernacular languages, which were only\nfallen forms of Sanskrit, and hence the vernaculars could not become\nvehicles for religious and spiritual communication. The\nNaiy\u0101yikas argued that vernacular words did not even have\nlegitimate meanings of their own. They claimed that the vernacular\nwords reminded the listener of the corresponding Sanskrit words that\ncommunicated the meaning.\n4. Language and Meaning\n\nThe term artha in Sanskrit is used to denote the notion of\nmeaning. However, the meaning of this term ranges from a real object\nin the external world referred to by the word to a mere concept of an\nobject which may or may not correspond to anything in the external\nworld. The differences regarding what meaning is are argued out by the\nphilosophical schools of Ny\u0101ya,\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika, M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101,\nvarious schools of Buddhism, Sanskrit grammar, and poetics. Among\nthese schools, the schools of Ny\u0101ya,\nVai\u015be\u1e63ika, and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 have realist ontologies.\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 focuses mainly on interpreting\nthe Vedic scriptures. Buddhist thinkers generally pointed to language\nas depicting a false picture of reality. Sanskrit grammarians were\nmore interested in language and communication than in ontology, while\nSanskrit poetics focused on the poetic dimensions of meaning.\n\nThe modern distinction of \u201csense\u201d versus\n\u201creference\u201d is somewhat blurred in the Sanskrit\ndiscussions of the notion of meaning. The question Indian philosophers\nseem to raise is \u201cwhat does a word communicate?\u201d They were\nalso interested in detecting if there was some sort of sequence in\nwhich different aspects of layers of meaning were communicated.\nGenerally, the notion of meaning is further stratified into three or\nfour types. First there is the primary meaning, something that is\ndirectly and immediately communicated by a word. If the primary\nmeaning is inappropriate in a given context, then one moves to a\nsecondary meaning, an extension of the primary meaning. Beyond this is\nthe suggested meaning, which may or may not be the same as the meaning\nintended by the speaker.\n\nThe various Indian theories of meaning are closely related to the\noverall stances taken by the different schools. Among the factors\nwhich influence the notion of meaning are the ontological and\nepistemological views of a school, its views regarding the role of God\nand scripture, its specific focus on a certain type of discourse, and\nits ultimate purpose in theorizing.\n\nIn the Western literature on the notion of meaning in the Indian\ntradition, various terms such as \u201csense,\u201d\n\u201creference,\u201d \u201cdenotation,\u201d\n\u201cconnotation,\u201d \u201cdesignatum,\u201d and\n\u201cintension\u201d have been frequently used to render the\nSanskrit term artha. However, these terms carry specific\nnuances of their own, and no single term adequately conveys the idea\nof artha. Artha basically refers to the object\nsignified by a word. In numerous contexts, the term stands for an\nobject in the sense of an element of external reality. For instance,\nPata\u00f1jali says that when a word is pronounced, an\nartha \u201cobject\u201d is understood. For example:\n\u201cbring in a bull\u201d, \u201ceat yogurt\u201d, etc. It is\nthe artha that is brought in and it is also the\nartha that is eaten.\n\nThe schools of Ny\u0101ya and Vai\u015be\u1e63ika\nset up an ontology containing substances, qualities, actions,\nrelations, generic and particular properties, etc. With this realistic\nontology in mind, they argue that if the relation between a word and\nits artha (\u201cmeaning\u201d) were a natural ontological\nrelation, there should be real experiences of burning and cutting in\none\u2019s mouth after hearing words like \u201cagni\u201d\n(\u201cfire\u201d) and \u201casi\u201d\n(\u201csword\u201d). Therefore, this relationship must be a\nconventional relationship (sa\u1e43keta), the convention\nbeing established by God as part of his initial acts of creation. The\nrelationship between a word and the object it refers to is thought to\nbe the desire of God that such and such a word should refer to such\nand such an object. It is through this established conventional\nrelationship that a word reminds the listener of its meaning. The\nschool of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 represents the\ntradition of the exegesis of the Vedic texts. However, in the course\nof discussing and perfecting principles of interpretation, this system\ndeveloped a full-scale theory of ontology and an important theory of\nmeaning. For the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, the primary tenet is that\nthe Vedic scriptural texts are eternal and uncreated, and that they\nare meaningful. For this orthodox system, which remarkably defends the\nscripture but dispenses with the notion of God, the relationship\nbetween a word and its meaning is an innate eternal relationship. For\nboth Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas, language refers to external states of the\nworld and not just to conceptual constructions.\n\nThe tradition of grammarians, beginning with Bhart\u1e5bhari, seems\nto have followed a middle path between the realistic theories of\nreference (b\u0101hy\u0101rthav\u0101da) developed by\nNy\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika and\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 on the one hand, and the\nnotional/conceptual meaning (vikalpa) of the Buddhists on the\nother. For the grammarians, the meaning of a word is closely related\nto the level of understanding. Whether or not things are real, we do\nhave concepts. These concepts form the content of a person\u2019s\ncognitions derived from language. Without necessarily denying or\naffirming the external reality of objects in the world, grammarians\nclaimed that the meaning of a word is only a projection of intellect\n(bauddh\u0101rtha, buddhipratibh\u0101sa). The\nexamples offered by Sanskrit grammarians such as\n\u201c\u015ba\u015ba\u015b\u1e5b\u1e45ga\u201d\n(\u201chorn of a rabbit\u201d) and\n\u201cvandhy\u0101suta\u201d (\u201cson of a barren\nwoman\u201d) remain meaningful within this theory. Sanskrit\ngrammarians are thus not concerned with ontological or truth\nfunctional values of linguistic expressions. For them the truth of an\nexpression and its meaningfulness are not to be equated.\n\nBy the middle of the second millennium of the Christian era, certain\nuniformity came about in the technical terminology used by different\nschools. The prominent schools in this period are the new school of\nNy\u0101ya initiated by Ga\u1e45ge\u015ba, the schools of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101, Ved\u0101nta, and Sanskrit\ngrammar. While all these schools are engaged in pitched battles\nagainst each other, they seem to accept the terminological lead of the\nneo-logicians, the Navya-Naiy\u0101yikas. Following the discussion of\nthe term artha by the neo-logician\nGad\u0101dharabha\u1e6d\u1e6da, we can state the general framework\nof a semantic theory. Other schools accept this general terminology,\nwith some variations.\n\nIt may be said that the term artha (\u201cmeaning\u201d)\nstands for the object or content of a verbal cognition or a cognition\nthat results from hearing a word\n(\u015b\u0101bda-bodha-vi\u1e63aya). Such\na verbal cognition results from the cognition of a word\n(\u015b\u0101bda-j\u00f1\u0101na) on the basis of\nan awareness of the signification function pertaining to that word\n(pada-ni\u1e63\u1e6dha-v\u1e5btti-j\u00f1\u0101na).\nDepending upon the kind of signification function\n(v\u1e5btti) involved in the emergence of the verbal\ncognition, the meaning belongs to a distinct type. In general\nterms:\n\n When a verbal cognition results from the primary signification\nfunction (\u015bakti / abhidh\u0101v\u1e5btti /\nmukhyav\u1e5btti) of a word, the object or content of that\nverbal cognition is called primary meaning\n(\u015baky\u0101rtha / v\u0101cy\u0101rtha /\nabhidheya).\n When a verbal cognition results from the secondary signification\nfunction (lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101v\u1e5btti /\ngu\u1e47av\u1e5btti) of a word, the object or content of\nthat verbal cognition is called secondary meaning\n(lak\u1e63y\u0101rtha).\n When a verbal cognition results from the suggestive signification\nfunction (vya\u00f1jan\u0101v\u1e5btti) of a word, the\nobject or content of that verbal cognition is called suggested meaning\n(vya\u1e45gy\u0101rtha / dhvanit\u0101rtha).\n When a verbal cognition results from the intentional\nsignification function (t\u0101tparyav\u1e5btti) of a word,\nthe object or content of that verbal cognition is called intended\nmeaning (t\u0101tpary\u0101rtha).\n\n\nNot all the different schools of Indian philosophy accept all of these\ndifferent kinds of signification functions for words, and they hold\nsubstantially different views on the nature of words, meanings, and\nthe relations between words and meanings. However, the above\nterminology holds true, in general, for most of the medieval schools.\nLet us note some of the important differences.\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 claims that the sole primary\nmeaning of the word \u201cbull\u201d is the generic property or the\nclass property (j\u0101ti) such as bull-ness, while the\nindividual object which possesses this generic property, i.e., a\nparticular bull, is only secondarily and subsequently understood from\nthe word \u201cbull\u201d. The school called\nKevalavyaktiv\u0101da argues that a particular individual\nbull is the sole primary meaning of the word \u201cbull,\u201d while\nthe generic property bull-ness is merely a secondary meaning.\nNy\u0101ya argues that the primary meaning of a word is an\nindividual object qualified by a generic property\n(j\u0101ti-vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6da-vyakti),\nboth being perceived simultaneously.\n\nSanskrit grammarians distinguish between various different kinds of\nmeanings (artha). The term artha stands for an\nexternal object (vastum\u0101tra), as well as for the object\nthat is intended to be signified by a word (abhidheya). The\nlatter, i.e., meaning in a linguistic sense, could be meaning in a\ntechnical context (\u015b\u0101str\u012bya), such as the\nmeaning of an affix or a stem, or it may be meaning as understood by\npeople in actual communication (laukika). Then there is a\nfurther difference. Meaning may be something directly intended to be\nsignified by an expression (abhidheya), or it could be\nsomething which is inevitably signified\n(n\u0101ntar\u012byaka) when something else is really the\nintended meaning. Everything that is understood from a word on the\nbasis of some kind of signification function (v\u1e5btti) is\ncovered by the term artha. Different systems of Indian\nphilosophy differ from each other on whether a given cognition is\nderived from a word on the basis of a signification function\n(v\u1e5btti), through inference (anum\u0101na), or\npresumption (arth\u0101patti). If a particular item of\ninformation is deemed to have been derived through inference or\npresumption, it is not included in the notion of word-meaning.\n\nThe scope of the term artha is actually not limited in\nSanskrit texts to what is usually understood as the domain of\nsemantics in the western literature. It covers elements such as gender\n(li\u1e45ga) and number (sa\u1e43khy\u0101). It\nalso covers the semantic-syntactic roles (k\u0101raka) such\nas agent-ness (kart\u1e5btva) and object-ness\n(karmatva). Tenses such as the present, past, and future, and\nthe moods such as the imperative and optative are also traditionally\nincluded in the arthas signified by a verb root, or an affix.\nAnother aspect of the concept of artha is revealed in the\ntheory of dyoty\u0101rtha (\u201cco-signified\u201d)\nmeaning. According to this theory, to put it in simple terms,\nparticles such as ca (\u201cand\u201d) do not have any\nlexical or primary meaning. They are said to help other words used in\nconstruction with them to signify some special aspects of their\nmeaning. For instance, in the phrase \u201cJohn and Tom\u201d, the\nmeaning of grouping is said to be not directly signified by the word\n\u201cand\u201d. The theory of dyoty\u0101rtha argues that\ngrouping is a specific meaning of the two words \u201cJohn\u201d and\n\u201cTom\u201d, but that these two words are unable to signify this\nmeaning if used by themselves. The word \u201cand\u201d used along\nwith these two words is said to work as a catalyst that enables them\nto signify this special meaning. The problem of use and mention of\nwords is also handled by Sanskrit grammarians by treating the\nphonological form of the word itself to be a part of the meaning it\nsignifies. This is a unique way of handling this problem.\n6. Different views regarding sentence-meaning\n\nMost schools of Indian philosophy have an atomistic view of meaning\nand the meaning-bearing linguistic unit. This means that a sentence is\nput together by combining words and words are put together by\ncombining morphemic elements like stems, roots, and affixes. The same\napplies to meaning. The word-meaning may be viewed as a fusion of the\nmeanings of stems, roots, and affixes, and the meaning of a sentence\nmay be viewed as a fusion of the meanings of its constituent words.\nBeyond this generality, different schools have specific proposals. The\ntradition of Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 proposes that the words of a\nsentence already convey contextualized inter-connected meanings\n(anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na) and that the sentence-meaning is\nnot different from a simple addition of these inherently\ninter-connected word-meanings. On the other hand, the Naiy\u0101yikas\nand the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43sakas propose\nthat words of a sentence taken by themselves convey only\nuncontextualized unconnected meanings, and that these uncontextualized\nword-meanings are subsequently brought into a contextualized\nassociation with each other (abhihit\u0101nvaya). Therefore,\nthe sentence-meaning is different from word-meanings, and is\ncommunicated through the concatenation (sa\u1e43sarga) of\nwords, rather than by the words themselves. This is also the view of\nthe early grammarians like K\u0101ty\u0101yana and\nPata\u00f1jali.\n\nFor the later grammarian-philosopher Bhart\u1e5bhari, however, there\nare no divisions in speech acts and in communicated meanings. He says\nthat only a person ignorant of the real nature of language believes\nthe divisions of sentences into words, stems, roots, and affixes to be\nreal. Such divisions are useful fictions and have an explanatory value\nin grammatical theory, but have no reality in communication. In\nreality, there is no sequence in the cognitions of these different\ncomponents. The sentence-meaning becomes an object or content of a\nsingle instance of a flash of cognition (pratibh\u0101).\n7. Some important conceptions\n\nThe terms \u015bakyat\u0101vacchedaka and\nprav\u1e5bttinimitta signify a property which determines the\ninclusion of a particular instance within the class of possible\nentities referred to by a word. It is a property whose possession by\nan entity is the necessary and sufficient condition for a given word\nbeing used to refer to that entity. Thus, the property of potness may\nbe viewed as the \u015bakyat\u0101vacchedaka controlling the\nuse of the word \u201cpot\u201d.\n\nThe concept of lak\u1e63a\u1e47\u0101 (\u201csecondary\nsignification function\u201d) is invoked in a situation where the\nprimary meaning of an utterance does not appear to make sense in view\nof the intention behind the utterance, and hence one looks for a\nsecondary meaning. However, the secondary meaning is always something\nthat is related to the primary meaning in some way. For example, the\nexpression ga\u1e45g\u0101y\u0101\u1e43\ngho\u1e63a\u1e25 literally refers to a cowherd-colony on\nthe Ganges. Here, it is argued that one obviously cannot have a\ncowherd-colony sitting on top of the river Ganges. This would clearly\ngo against the intention of the speaker. Thus, there is both a\ndifficulty of justifying the linkage of word-meanings\n(anvay\u0101nupapatti) and a difficulty of justifying the\nliteral or primary meaning in relation to the intention of the speaker\n(t\u0101tpary\u0101nupapatti). These interpretive\ndifficulties nudge one away from the primary meaning of the expression\nto a secondary meaning, which is related to that primary meaning.\nThus, we understand the expression as referring to a cowherd-colony\n\u201con the bank of the river Ganges\u201d.\n\nIt is the next level of meaning or vya\u00f1jan\u0101\n(\u201csuggestive signification function\u201d) which is analyzed\nand elaborated more specifically by authors like \u0100nandavardhana\nin the tradition of Sanskrit poetics. Consider the following instance\nof poetic suggestion. With her husband out on a long travel, a\nlovelorn young wife instructs a visiting young man: \u201cMy dear\nguest, I sleep here and my night-blind mother-in-law sleeps over\nthere. Please make sure you do not stumble at night.\u201d The\nsuggested meaning is an invitation to the young man to come and share\nher bed. Thus, the poetic language goes well beyond the levels of\nlexical and metaphorical meanings, and heightens the aesthetic\npleasure through such suggestions.\n8. Why the differences?\n\nThe nuances of these different theories are closely related to the\nmarkedly different interests of the schools within which they\ndeveloped. Sanskrit poetics was interested in the poetic dimensions of\nmeaning. Grammarians were interested in language and cognition, but\nhad little interest in ontological categories per se, except as\nconceptual structures revealed by the usage of words. For them words\nand meanings had to be explained irrespective of one\u2019s metaphysical\nviews. Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas were primarily into\nlogic, epistemology, and ontology, and argued that a valid sentence\nwas a true picture of a state of reality. The foremost goal of\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 was to interpret and defend the\nVedic scriptures. Thus, meaning for\nM\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 had to be eternal, uncreated,\nand unrelated to the intention of a person, because its word par\nexcellence, the Vedic scripture, was eternal, uncreated, and beyond\nthe authorship of a divine or human person. The scriptural word was\nthere to instruct people on how to perform proper ritual and moral\nduties, but there was no intention behind it. The Buddhists, on the\nother hand, aimed at weaning people away from all attachment to the\nworld, and hence at showing the emptiness of everything, including\nlanguage. They were more interested in demonstrating how language\nfails to portray reality, than in explaining how it works. The\ntheories of meaning were thus a significant part of the total agenda\nof each school and need to be understood in their specific\ncontext.\n",
