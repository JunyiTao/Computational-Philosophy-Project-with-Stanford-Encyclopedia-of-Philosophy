    "main_text": "Thin Luck\n3. Thin Luck\n\nThe concept of luck is a curious one (Dennett 1984, 92; see also\nPritchard 2005, 125\u2013133; Pritchard and Whittington 2015). To\navoid various pitfalls, it helps to distinguish thin and thick notions\nof luck (as suggested by Hurley 2002, 79\u201380; Hurley 2003,\n107\u2013109; Vallentyne 2006, 434). To say that\nsomething\u2014whether a choice or an outcome (other than choice)\n(Olsaretti 2009; Scheffler 2003, 18\u201319)\u2014is a matter of\nthin luck for someone is to say merely that this person does\nnot stand in a certain moral relationship to a certain object, where\nsuch moral relationship essentially involves this individual in his or\nher capacity as a rational agent. To say that something is a matter of\nthick luck is to say this and to commit oneself to a certain\naccount of the non-moral properties in virtue of which this moral\nrelationship obtains. Accordingly, a thick concept of luck is a more\nspecific version of the corresponding thin concept of luck. In either\ncase, to say that something is a matter of luck for someone, in the\nsense of \u201cluck\u201d that is relevant to justice, is to imply\nthat it affects this person\u2019s interests for good or bad (see,\nhowever, Sher\u2019s discussion (2014, 20\u201334) of whether the\nrelevant objection to luck applies to people\u2019s absolute or\ncomparative distributive positions).\n\nThere are several varieties of thin notions of luck. One is the\nfollowing kind of responsibility luck:\n\nY is a matter of luck for X if, and only if,\nX is not morally responsible for Y.\n\n\nIn this definition, like those set out below, \u201cX\u201d\nranges over individuals and \u201cY\u201d ranges over items\nthat can be a matter of luck for an individual, e.g., events, states\nof affairs, personality traits, actions, omissions, and much else. A\nnumber of views about what makes an agent responsible for something\nhave been taken (for overviews, see Matravers 2007, 14\u201364;\nTalbert 2019). On responsibility for actions (and omissions), (a) some\nemphasize the role of the ability to act otherwise (Ayer 1982; Moore\n1912), (b) others focus on whether an act is appropriately related to\nthe agent\u2019s real self (Frankfurt 1988; Watson 1982), and (c) yet\nothers think that what matters is whether the agent acted from a\nsuitable reasons-sensitive mechanism (Fischer and Ravizza 1998;\nFischer 2006). To say that an outcome conforms to (1) is to remain\nneutral on which of these accounts is correct. (It has become common\nto distinguish between attributive and substantive responsibility\n(Scanlon 1999, 248\u2013251; Scanlon 2006, 72\u201380). The former\nconcerns what comprises a suitable basis for moral appraisal of an\nagent. The latter concerns what people are required to do for one\nanother. While the issue of luck arises in relation to both senses of\nresponsibility, ultimately it is the latter which, ultimately, is\ncrucial to distributive justice, even though moral appraisal of people\nand their actions might have implications for what they owe one\nanother.)\n\nThin notions of luck need not be notions of responsibility luck. Thus\nthe following notion of desert luck is thin:\n\nY is a matter of thin luck for X if, and only\nif, it is not the case that X deserves Y.\n\n\nAs with responsibility, a number of views about what makes an agent\ndeserving are possible (Kagan 2012, 6\u20137; Sher 1987, 7). Some\naccounts hold the basis of desert to be the value of one\u2019s\ncontribution, while others hold the desert basis to be one\u2019s\nlevel of effort. People who think that justice should neutralize the\nluck specified by (2) can disagree over these accounts.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that thin responsibility luck and thin desert\nluck are independent of one another. First, X may be\nresponsible for Y and yet not deserve Y. Thus a man\nwho heroically throws himself on to a grenade to save his comrades,\nthereby losing his life, is responsible for his own death\u2014indeed\nthis is what makes his act praiseworthy\u2014even if he did not\ndeserve to die. Second, X may deserve Y without\nbeing responsible for Y. Thus a poor saint who stumbles,\nentirely fortuitously, upon a gold nugget might deserve (in the wider\nscheme of things) to be enriched by his discovery even though he is\nnot responsible for making it.\n\nOther thin notions of luck can be described, but thin desert luck and\n(especially) thin responsibility luck have received the lion\u2019s\nshare of attention in the literature on distributive justice. While\nclearly different, they are occasionally conflated (as pointed out in\nHurley 2003, 191\u201395).\n",
