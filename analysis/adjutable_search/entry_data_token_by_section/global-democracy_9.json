From \u2018Model of Democracy\u2019 to \u2018Values of Democratization\u2019\n\n\nThe preceding five models provide a brief schematic of how global\ndemocracy proposals have typically been crafted in the academic\nliterature. In the recent few years, however, global democratic\ndebates have taken a turn away from \u2018models\u2019 toward\n\u2018values of democratization\u2019. This section outlines the\ncore impetus behind this turn and its methodological foundation, and\nthen discusses several prominent examples in the literature.\n",
