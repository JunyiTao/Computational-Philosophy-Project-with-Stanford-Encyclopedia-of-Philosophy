    "main_text": "Combining temporal and other logics\n9. Combining temporal and other logics\n\nLogics can be used to reason about dynamically changing aspects of the\nworld, and time plays a role in many domains. For instance, the notion\nof knowledge studied in epistemic logic, the idea of an action\nunderlying logics of agency, or the physical concept of space in\nspatial logics all bear an intimate relation to time. It is therefore\nnatural to add a temporal dimension to these logics and equip the\ncorresponding languages with temporal operators that are suited to\ncapture the relevant notion of change.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, there are several ways of combining\nmodels and logical systems: products, fusions, etc. (see the entry on\n combining logics).\n These constructions provide different mechanisms for temporalizing a\nlogic and raise generic questions about transfer of logical\nproperties, such as axiomatizations, completeness, decidability.\nDecidability, for instance, is usually preserved in fusions, while it\nis often lost in products of logical systems. For a general discussion\nof temporalizing logical systems and properties of temporalized\nlogics, see Finger and Gabbay (1992; 1996); Finger et al. (2002); and\nGabbay et al. (2003). Here we only present and briefly discuss some of\nthe most popular cases of temporalized logical systems.\n",
