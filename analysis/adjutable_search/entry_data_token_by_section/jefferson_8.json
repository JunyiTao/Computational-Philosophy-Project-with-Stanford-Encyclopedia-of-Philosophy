    "main_text": "Political Philosophy || Revolution\n4.4 Revolution\n\nEven well-intended governments can still go astray. Jefferson writes\nin his Declaration of Independence,\n\n\nWhenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it\nis the right of the people to alter or abolish it, & to institute\nnew government, laying it\u2019s foundation on such principles, &\norganizing it\u2019s powers in such form, as to them shall seem most\nlikely to effect their safety & happiness ([D]: 19). \n\n\nHowever, long-standing governments ought not to be changed \u201cfor\nlight & transient causes,\u201d otherwise one risks supplantation\nof a corrupt government with another that is equally or more corrupt.\nYet\n\n\nwhen a long train of abuses & usurpations pursuing invariably the\nsame object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism,\nit is [citizens\u2019] right, it is their duty to throw off such\ngovernment, & to provide new guards for their future security\n([D]: 19).\n\n\nIn his Summary View of the Rights of British America, Jefferson states\nthat for revolution to occur, there needs to be \u201cmany\nunwarrantable encroachments and usurpations\u201d ([S]: 105). He\nadds,\n\n\nSingle acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinion of a\nday; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, and\npursued unalterably through every change of ministers, too plainly\nprove a deliberate and systematical plan of reducing us to slavery\n([S]: 110).\n\n\nTherefore, a government becomes destructive when its abuses and\nusurpations are (1) many and long, (2) directed to the same end, and\n(3) clearly indicative of despotism.\n\nFor Jefferson, some amount of turbulence is one of the consequences of\nliberty. The manure of blood is needed for healthy governing because\nthose governing will tend over time, Jefferson says to William S.\nSmith (13 Nov. 1787), to govern in their own interests, if not\ncarefully watched. Moreover, those governed will assume mistakenly\nthat rights once granted will be rights always granted. So, rebellion\nis the mechanism whereby those governing, Jefferson tells James\nMadison (30 Jan. 1787), are periodically reminded that government in a\nJeffersonian republic is of and for the people\u2014that is, that the\nwill of the majority, fittingly educated, is the standard of\njustice.\n\nThe turbulence of which Jefferson speaks in the letters to Smith and\nMadison are illustrations of rebellion, says Holowchak (2019a,\n73\u201376), not revolution. In contrast, revolution for Jefferson,\nfollowing his Declaration, is a complex phenomenon. Unlike a\nrebellion, it is never to be undertaken for slight reasons or because\nof singular cases of governmental abuse. The difference, for\nHolowchak, is one of scope, size, and persistency. Rebellions, often\nviolent, are generally quick signals to government concerning abuses,\nusually parochial. Revolutions, essentially violent, are long-term,\nwell-planned, complex attempts at overthrowing a government, deemed\nhabitually abusive.\n\nMirkin interprets Jefferson otherwise. He does not distinguish between\nrebellion and revolution, but distinguishes between \u201ctwo levels\nof revolt\u201d: populist rebellions and elitist threats of\nrebellion. The former, exemplified by Shays\u2019 Rebellion and the\nWhiskey Rebellion, are local and presumably non-moral issues. The\nlatter, exemplified by the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, are\nlarger, morality-grounded issues (e.g., transgression of rights), and\nbecause of that, there is a persistency to them (64\u201365).\n\n\nOne thing is clear. Revolutions or elitist rebellions, for Jefferson,\nare larger, more persistent, and more complex than rebellions or\npopulist rebellions. To John Adams (4 Sept. 1823), Jefferson writes of\nthe beginning, sustainment, and resolution of revolutions. \u201cThe\ngeneration which commences a revolution can rarely compleat it.\nHabituated from their infancy to passive submission of body and mind\nto their kings and priests, they are not qualified, when called on, to\nthink and provide for themselves, and their inexperience, their\nignorance and bigotry make them instruments often, in the hands of the\nBonapartes and Iturbides to defeat their own rights and\npurposes.\u201d Revolutions cannot be expected to establish a\nsustainable, free government in the first effort.\n\nMoreover, the revolutionary generation is generally suited to begin\nand sustain the revolution, Jefferson continues in the letter to\nAdams, but not to resolve it. It is, for Jefferson, incapable of\nfixing a viable republican constitution. There are, thus, generational\nresponsibilities for a Jeffersonian revolution to succeed. The role of\nthe first generation is inchoation. Subsequent generations must\nsustain and complete the initial effort to usurp the coercive\ngovernment. In the final stage, there is implementation of a\nconstitution, reflective of and beholden to the will of the\npeople.\n\nIt is because of the complexity and cost, in terms of human lives,\nthat Jefferson maintained that revolutions ought only to be undertaken\nin cases of extreme, consistent despotism. As he writes in his\nDeclaration ([D]: 19), \u201cWhen a long train of abuses and\nusurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to\nreduce them [the people] under absolute Despotism, it is their right,\nit is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new\nGuards for their future security.\u201d Still, he thought that they\nwere \u201cmechanisms\u201d needed in republican governments, for\nthere is a human tendency for those in power to be seduced by that\npower (TJ to Spencer Roane, 9 Mar. 1821).\n",
