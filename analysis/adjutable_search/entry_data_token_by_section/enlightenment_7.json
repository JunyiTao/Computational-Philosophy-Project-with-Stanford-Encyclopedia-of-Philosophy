    "main_text": "The Good: Political Theory, Ethical Theory and Religion in the Enlightenment || Ethical Theory\n2.2 Ethical Theory\n\nMany of the leading issues and positions of contemporary philosophical\nethics take shape within the Enlightenment. Prior to the Enlightenment\nin the West, ethical reflection begins from and orients itself around\nreligious doctrines concerning God and the afterlife. The highest good\nof humanity, and, accordingly, the content and grounding of moral\nduties, are conceived in immediately religious terms. During the\nEnlightenment, this changes, certainly within philosophy, but to some\nsignificant degree, within the population of western society at large.\nAs the processes of industrialization, urbanization, and dissemination\nof education advance in this period, happiness in this life, rather\nthan union with God in the next, becomes the highest end for more and\nmore people. Also, the violent religious wars that bloody Europe in\nthe early modern period motivate the development of secular,\nthis-worldly ethics, insofar as they indicate the failure of religious\ndoctrines concerning God and the afterlife to establish a stable\nfoundation for ethics. In the Enlightenment, philosophical thinkers\nconfront the problem of developing ethical systems on a secular,\nbroadly naturalistic basis for the first time since the rise of\nChristianity eclipsed the great classical ethical systems. However,\nthe changes in our understanding of nature and cosmology, effected by\nmodern natural science, make recourse to the systems of Plato and\nAristotle problematic. The Platonic identification of the good with\nthe real and the Aristotelian teleological understanding of natural\nthings are both difficult to square with the Enlightenment conception\nof nature. The general philosophical problem emerges in the\nEnlightenment of how to understand the source and grounding of ethical\nduties, and how to conceive the highest good for human beings, within\na secular, broadly naturalistic context, and within the context of a\ntransformed understanding of the natural world.\n\nIn ethical thought, as in political theory, Hobbes\u2019 thought is\nan important provocation in the Enlightenment. Hobbes understands what\nis good, as the end of human action, to be \u201cwhatsoever is the\nobject of any man\u2019s appetite or desire,\u201d and evil to be\n\u201cthe object of his hate, and aversion,\u201d \u201cthere being\nnothing simply and absolutely so; nor any common rule of good and\nevil, to be taken from the nature of the objects themselves\u201d\n(Leviathan, chapter 6). Hobbes\u2019 conception of human\nbeings as fundamentally motivated by their perception of what is in\ntheir own best interest implies the challenge, important for\nEnlightenment moral philosophy, to construct moral duties of justice\nand benevolence out of such limited materials. The basis of human\naction that Hobbes posits is immediately intelligible and even shared\nwith other animals to some extent; a set of moral duties constructed\non this basis would also be intelligible, de-mystified, and fit within\nthe larger scheme of nature. Bernard Mandeville is sometimes grouped\nwith Hobbes in the Enlightenment, especially by critics of them both,\nbecause he too, in his popular Fable of the Bees; or, Private\nVices, Public Benefits (1714), sees people as fundamentally\nmotivated by their perceived self-interest, and then undertakes to\ntell a story about how moral virtue, which involves conquering\none\u2019s own appetite and serving the interests of others, can be\nunderstood to arise on this basis.\n\nSamuel Clarke, an influential rationalist British thinker early in the\nEnlightenment, undertakes to show in his Discourse concerning the\nUnchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion (1706), against\nHobbes, that the absolute difference between moral good and moral evil\nlies in the immediately discernible nature of things, independently of\nany compacts or positive legislation by God or human beings. Clarke\nwrites that \u201cin men\u2019s dealing \u2026 one with another,\nit is undeniably more fit, absolutely and in the nature of the thing\nitself, that all men should endeavor to promote the universal good and\nwelfare of all; than that all men should be continually contriving the\nruin and destruction of all\u201d. Likewise for the rest of what\nmorality enjoins upon us. According to Clarke, that some actions\n(those we call morally good or required) are \u201cfit to be\ndone\u201d and others not fit is grounded upon the immediately\nevident relations in which things stand to each other in nature, just\nas \u201cthe proportions of lines or numbers\u201d are evident to\nthe rational perception of a reasonable being. Similarly, Christian\nWolff\u2019s rationalist practical philosophy also grounds moral\nduties in an objective rational order. However, the objective quality\non which moral requirements are grounded for Wolff is not the\n\u201cfitness\u201d of things to be done but rather their\nperfection. Wolff counts as a founder of the Aufkl\u00e4rung\nin part because of his attempted derivation of ethical duties from an\norder of perfection in things, discernable through reason,\nindependently of divine commands.\n\nRationalist ethics so conceived faces the following obstacles in the\nEnlightenment. First, as implied above, it becomes increasingly\nimplausible that the objective, mind-independent order is really as\nrationalist ethicists claim it to be. Second, even if the objective\nrealm were ordered as the rationalist claims, it remains unclear how\nthis order gives rise (on its own, as it were) to obligations binding\non our wills. David Hume famously exposes the fallacy of deriving a\nprescriptive statement (that one ought to perform some action) from a\ndescription of how things stand in relation to each other in nature.\nPrima facie, there is a gap between the rationalist\u2019s objective\norder and a set of prescriptions binding on our wills; if a supreme\nlegislator must be re-introduced in order to make the conformity of\nour actions to that objective order binding on our wills, then the\nalleged existence of the objective moral order does not do the work\nthe account asks of it in the first place.\n\nAlongside the rationalist strand of ethical philosophy in the\nEnlightenment, there is also a very significant empiricist strand.\nEmpirical accounts of moral virtue in the period are distinguished,\nboth by grounding moral virtue on an empirical study of human nature,\nand by grounding cognition of moral duties and moral motivation in\nhuman sensibility, rather than in reason. The Third Earl of\nShaftesbury, author of the influential work Characteristics of\nMen, Manners, Opinions, Times (1711), is a founding figure of the\nempiricist strand. Shaftesbury, like Clarke, is provoked by\nHobbes\u2019 egoism to provide a non-egoistic account of moral\nvirtue. Shaftesbury conceives the core notion of the goodness of\nthings teleologically: something is good if it contributes to the\nwell-being or furtherance of the system of which it is a part.\nIndividual animals are members of species, and therefore they are good\nas such insofar as they contribute to the well-being of the species of\nwhich they are a part. Thus, the good of things, including human\nbeings, for Shaftesbury as for Clarke, is an objective quality that is\nknowable through reason. However, though we can know what is good\nthrough reason, Shaftesbury maintains that reason alone is not\nsufficient to motivate human action. Shaftesbury articulates the\nstructure of a distinctively human moral sensibility. Moral\nsensibility depends on the faculty of reflection. When we reflect on\nfirst-order passions such as gratitude, kindness and pity, we find\nourselves approving or liking them and disapproving or disliking their\nopposites. By virtue of our receptivity to such feelings, we are\ncapable of virtue and have a sense of right and wrong. In this way,\nShaftesbury defines the moral sense that plays a significant role in\nthe theories of subsequent Enlightenment thinkers such as Francis\nHutcheson and David Hume.\n\nIn the rationalist tradition, the conflict within the breast of the\nperson between the requirements of morality and self-interest is\ncanonically a conflict between the person\u2019s reason and her\npassions. Shaftesbury\u2019s identification of a moral sentiment in\nthe nature of humanity renders this a conflict within sensibility\nitself, a conflict between different sentiments, between a\nself-interested sentiment and an unegoistic sentiment. Though both\nShaftesbury and Hutcheson, no less than Clarke, oppose Hobbes\u2019s\negoism, it is nonetheless true that the doctrine of moral sensibility\nsoftens moral demands, so to speak. Doing what is morally right or\nmorally good is intrinsically bound up with a distinctive kind of\npleasure on their accounts. It is significant that both Shaftesbury\nand Hutcheson, the two founders of modern moral sense theory,\narticulate their ethical theory in conjunction with an aesthetic\ntheory. Arguably the pleasure we feel in the apprehension of something\nbeautiful is disinterested pleasure. Our susceptibility to\naesthetic pleasure can be taken to reveal that we apprehend and\nrespond to objective (or, anyway, universal) values, not only or\nnecessarily on the basis of reason, but through our natural\nsensibility instead. Thus, aesthetics, as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson\nindependently develop an account of it, gives encouragement to their\ndoctrines of moral sensibility. But an account of moral virtue, unlike\naesthetics, requires an account of moral motivation. As noted\nabove, both Shaftesbury and Hutcheson want to do justice to the idea\nthat proper moral motivation is not the pursuit of pleasure, even\ndisinterested pleasure, but rather an immediate response to the\nperception of moral value. The problem of giving a satisfying account\nof moral motivation is a difficult one for empiricist moral\nphilosophers in the Enlightenment.\n\nWhile for Shaftesbury, at the beginning of the moral sense tradition,\nmoral sense tracks a mind-independent order of value, David Hume,\nmotivated in part by a more radical empiricism, is happy to let the\nobjective order go. We have no access through reason to an independent\norder of value which moral sense would track. For Hume, morality is\nfounded completely on our sentiments. Hume is often regarded as the\nmain originator of so-called \u201cethical subjectivism\u201d,\naccording to which moral judgments or evaluations (regarding actions\nor character) do not make claims about independent facts but merely\nexpress the subject\u2019s feelings or attitudes with respect to\nactions or character. Such subjectivism is relieved of the difficult\ntask of explaining how the objective order of values belongs to the\nnatural world as it is being reconceived by natural science in the\nperiod; however, it faces the challenge of explaining how error and\ndisagreement in moral judgments and evaluations are possible.\nHume\u2019s account of the standards of moral judgment follows that\nof Hutcheson in relying centrally on the \u201cnatural\u201d\nresponses of an ideal observer or spectator.\n\nHume\u2019s ethics is exemplary of philosophical ethics in the\nEnlightenment by virtue of its belonging to the attempt to provide a\nnew, empirically grounded science of human nature, free of theological\npresuppositions. As noted above, the attempts by the members of the\nFrench Enlightenment to present a new understanding of human nature\nare strongly influenced by Locke\u2019s \u201csensationalism\u201d,\nwhich, radicalized by Condillac, amounts to the attempt to base all\ncontents and faculties of the human mind on the senses. Typically, the\nFrench philosophes draw more radical or iconoclastic\nimplications from the new \u201cscience of man\u201d than English or\nScottish Enlightenment figures. Claude-Adrien Helv\u00e9tius\n(1715\u20131771) is typical here. In De\nl\u2019\u00e9sprit (1758), Helv\u00e9tius follows the\nLockean sensationalism of Condillac and pairs it with the claim that\nhuman beings are motivated in their actions only by the natural desire\nto maximize their own pleasure and minimize their pain. De\nl\u2019\u00e9sprit, though widely read, gives rise to strong\nnegative reactions in the time, both by political and religious\nauthorities (the Sorbonne, the Pope and the Parlement of Paris all\ncondemn the book) and by prominent fellow philosophes, in\ngreat part because Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s psychology seems to\ncritics to render moral imperatives and values without basis, despite\nhis best attempts to derive them. Helv\u00e9tius attempts to ground\nthe moral equality of all human beings by portraying all human beings,\nwhatever their standing in the social hierarchy, whatever their\nspecial talents and gifts, as equally products of the nature we share\nplus the variable influences of education and social environment. But,\nto critics, Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s account portrays all human beings\nas equal only by virtue of portraying all as equally worthless\n(insofar as the claim to equality is grounded on all being equally\ndetermined by external factors). However, Helv\u00e9tius\u2019s\nideas, in De l\u2019\u00e9sprit as well as in its\nposthumously published sequel De l\u2019homme (1772), exert\na great deal of influence, especially his case for the role of\npleasure and pain in human motivation and the role of education and\nsocial incentives in shaping individuals into contributors to the\nsocial good. Helv\u00e9tius is sometimes regarded as the father of\nmodern utilitarianism through his articulation of the greatest\nhappiness principle and through his influence on Bentham.\n\nHelv\u00e9tius is typical in the respect that he is radical in the\nrevisions he proposes, not in common moral judgments or customs of the\ntime, but rather regarding the philosophical grounding of those\njudgments and customs. But there are some philosophers in the\nEnlightenment who are radical in the revisions they propose regarding\nthe content of ethical judgments themselves. The Marquis de Sade is\nmerely the most notorious example, among a set of Enlightenment\nfigures (including also the Marquis de Argens and Diderot himself in\nsome of his writings) who, within the context of the new naturalism\nand its emphasis on the pursuit of pleasure, celebrate the avid\npursuit of sexual pleasure and explicitly challenge the sexual mores,\nas well as the wider morality, of their time. The more or less\nfictionalized, philosophically self-conscious \u201clibertine\u201d\nis one significant expression of Enlightenment ethical thought.\n\nIf the French Enlightenment tends to advance this-worldly happiness as\nthe highest good for human beings more insistently than the\nEnlightenment elsewhere, then Rousseau\u2019s voice is, in this as in\nother respects, a discordant voice in that context. Rousseau advances\nthe cultivation and realization of human freedom as the\nhighest end for human beings and thereby gives expression to another\nside of Enlightenment ethics. As Rousseau describes it, the capacity\nfor individual self-determination puts us in a problematic relation to\nour natural desires and inclinations and to the realm of nature\ngenerally, insofar as that realm is constituted by mechanistic\ncausation. Though Rousseau places a great deal of emphasis on human\nfreedom, and makes significant contributions to our understanding of\nourselves as free, he does not address very seriously the problem of\nthe place of human freedom in the cosmos as it is conceived within the\ncontext of Enlightenment naturalism.\n\nHowever, Rousseau\u2019s writings help Kant to the articulation of a\npractical philosophy that addresses many of the tensions in the\nEnlightenment. Kant follows Rousseau, and disagrees with empiricism in\nethics in the period, in emphasizing human freedom, rather than human\nhappiness, as the central orienting concept of practical philosophy.\nThough Kant presents the moral principle as a principle of practical\nreason, his ethics also disagrees significantly with rationalist\nethics in the period. According to Kant, rationalists such as Wolff,\ninsofar as they take moral prescriptions to follow from an end given\nto the will (in Wolff\u2019s case, the end of perfection), do not\nunderstand us as autonomous in our moral activity. Through\ninterpreting the faculty of the will itself as practical reason, Kant\nunderstands the moral principle as internally legislated, thus as not\nonly compatible with freedom, but as equivalent to the principle of a\nfree will, as a principle of autonomy. As noted above, rationalists in\nethics in the period are challenged to explain how the objective moral\norder which reason in us allegedly discerns gives rise to valid\nprescriptions binding on our wills (the gap between is and\nought). For Kant, the moral order is not independent of our\nwill, but rather represents the formal constraints of willing as such.\nKant\u2019s account thus both avoids the is-ought gap and interprets\nmoral willing as expressive of our freedom.\n\nMoreover, by virtue of his interpretation of the moral principle as\nthe principle of pure practical reason, Kant is able to redeem the\nordinary sense of moral requirements as over-riding, as potentially\nopposed to the claims of one\u2019s happiness, and thus as different\nin kind from the deliverances of prudential reasoning. This ordinary\nsense of moral requirements is not easily accommodated within the\ncontext of Enlightenment empiricism and naturalism. Kant\u2019s stark\ndichotomy between a person\u2019s practical reason and her sensible\nnature is strongly criticized, both by the subsequent Romantic\ngeneration and in the contemporary context; but this dichotomy is\nbound up with an important benefit of Kant\u2019s view \u2013 much\npromoted by Kant himself \u2013 within the context of the\nEnlightenment. Elaborated in the context of Kant\u2019s idealism as a\ncontrast between the \u201crealm of freedom\u201d and the\n\u201crealm of nature\u201d, the dichotomy enables Kant\u2019s\nproposed solution to the conflict between freedom and nature that\nbesets Enlightenment thought. As noted above, Kant argues that the\napplication of the causal principle is restricted to the realm of\nnature, thus making room for freedom, compatibly with the causal\ndetermination of natural events required by scientific knowledge.\nAdditionally, Kant attempts to show that morality \u201cleads\nineluctably to\u201d religious belief (in the supersensible objects\nof God and of the immortal soul) while being essentially not founded\non religious belief, thus again vindicating the ordinary understanding\nof morality while still furthering Enlightenment values and\ncommitments.\n",
