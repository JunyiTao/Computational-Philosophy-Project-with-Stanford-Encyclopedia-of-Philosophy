    "main_text": "The Fact/Value Distinction\n8. The Fact/Value Distinction\n\nAt the start of this entry I listed \u201cvalue\u201d as a major\ncharacteristic of big data and pointed to the crucial role of valuing\nprocedures in identifying, processing, modelling and interpreting data\nas evidence. Identifying and negotiating different forms of data value\nis an unavoidable part of big data analysis, since these valuation\npractices determine which data is made available to whom, under which\nconditions and for which purposes. What researchers choose to consider\nas reliable data (and data sources) is closely intertwined not only\nwith their research goals and interpretive methods, but also with\ntheir approach to data production, packaging, storage and sharing.\nThus, researchers need to consider what value their data may have for\nfuture research by themselves and others, and how to enhance that\nvalue\u2014such as through decisions around which data to make\npublic, how, when and in which format; or, whenever dealing with data\nalready in the public domain (such as personal data on social media),\ndecisions around whether the data should be shared and used at all,\nand how.\n\nNo matter how one conceptualises value practices, it is clear that\ntheir key role in data management and analysis prevents facile\ndistinctions between values and \u201cfacts\u201d (understood as\npropositional claims for which data provide evidential warrant). For\nexample, consider a researcher who values both\nopenness\u2014and related practices of widespread data\nsharing\u2014and scientific rigour\u2014which requires a\nstrict monitoring of the credibility and validity of conditions under\nwhich data are interpreted. The scale and manner of big data\nmobilisation and analysis create tensions between these two values.\nWhile the commitment to openness may prompt interest in data sharing,\nthe commitment to rigour may hamper it, since once data are freely\ncirculated online it becomes very difficult to retain control over how\nthey are interpreted, by whom and with which knowledge, skills and\ntools. How a researcher responds to this conflict affects which data\nare made available for big data analysis, and under which conditions.\nSimilarly, the extent to which diverse datasets may be triangulated\nand compared depends on the intellectual property regimes under which\nthe data\u2014and related analytic tools\u2014have been produced.\nPrivately owned data are often unavailable to publicly funded\nresearchers; and many algorithms, cloud systems and computing\nfacilities used in big data analytics are only accessible to those\nwith enough resources to buy relevant access and training. Whatever\nclaims result from big data analysis are, therefore, strongly\ndependent on social, financial and cultural constraints that condition\nthe data pool and its analysis.\n\nThis prominent role of values in shaping data-related epistemic\npractices is not surprising given existing philosophical critiques of\nthe fact/value distinction (e.g., Douglas 2009), and the existing\nliterature on values in science\u2014such as Helen Longino\u2019s\nseminal distinction between constitutive and contextual values, as\npresented in her 1990 book Science as Social\nKnowledge\u2014may well apply in this case too. Similarly, it is\nwell-established that the technological and social conditions of\nresearch strongly condition its design and outcomes. What is\nparticularly worrying in the case of big data is the temptation,\nprompted by hyped expectations around the power of data analytics, to\nhide or side-line the valuing choices that underpin the methods,\ninfrastructures and algorithms used for big data extraction.\n\nConsider the use of high-throughput data production tools, which\nenable researchers to easily generate a large volume of data in\nformats already geared to computational analysis. Just as in the case\nof other technologies, researchers have a strong incentive to adopt\nsuch tools for data generation; and may do so even in cases where such\ntools are not good or even appropriate means to pursue the\ninvestigation. Ulrich Krohs uses the term convenience\nexperimentation to refer to experimental designs that are adopted\nnot because they are the most appropriate ways of pursuing a given\ninvestigation, but because they are easily and widely available and\nusable, and thus \u201cconvenient\u201d means for researchers to\npursue their goals (Krohs 2012).\n\nAppeals to convenience can extend to other aspects of data-intensive\nanalysis. Not all data are equally easy to digitally collect,\ndisseminate and link through existing algorithms, which makes some\ndata types and formats more convenient than others for computational\nanalysis. For example, research databases often display the outputs of\nwell-resourced labs within research traditions which deal with\n\u201ctractable\u201d data formats (such as \u201comics\u201d).\nAnd indeed, the existing distribution of resources, infrastructure and\nskills determines high levels of inequality in the\nproduction, dissemination and use of big data for research. Big\nplayers with large financial and technical resources are leading the\ndevelopment and uptake of data analytics tools, leaving much publicly\nfunded research around the world at the receiving end of innovation in\nthis area. Contrary to popular depictions of the data revolution as\nharbinger of transparency, democracy and social equality, the\ndigital divide between those who can access and use data\ntechnologies, and those who cannot, continues to widen. A result of\nsuch divides is the scarcity of data relating to certain subgroups and\ngeographical locations, which again limits the comprehensiveness of\navailable data resources.\n\nIn the vast ecosystem of big data infrastructures, it is difficult to\nkeep track of such distortions and assess their significance for data\ninterpretation, especially in situations where heterogeneous data\nsources structured through appeal to different values are mashed\ntogether. Thus, the systematic aggregation of convenient datasets and\nanalytic tools over others often results in a big data pool where the\nrelevant sources and forms of bias are impossible to locate and\naccount for (Pasquale 2015; O\u2019Neill 2016; Zuboff 2017; Leonelli\n2019a). In such a landscape, arguments for a separation between fact\nand value\u2014and even a clear distinction between the role of\nepistemic and non-epistemic values in knowledge\nproduction\u2014become very difficult to maintain without\ndiscrediting the whole edifice of big data science. Given the extent\nto which this approach has penetrated research in all domains, it is\narguably impossible, however, to critique the value-laden structure of\nbig data science without calling into question the legitimacy of\nscience itself. A more constructive approach is to embrace the extent\nto which big data science is anchored in human choices, interests and\nvalues, and ascertain how this affects philosophical views on\nknowledge, truth and method.\n",
