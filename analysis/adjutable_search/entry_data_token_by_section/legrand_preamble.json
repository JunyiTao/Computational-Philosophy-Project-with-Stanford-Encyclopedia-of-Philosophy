    "main_text": "\n\nAntoine Le Grand (1629\u20131699) was a philosopher and catholic\ntheologian who played an important role in propagating the Cartesian\nphilosophy in England and beyond during the latter half of the\nseventeenth century. He was born in Douai, (at the time under rule by\nthe Spanish Hapsburgs), and early in life was associated with an\nEnglish community of Franciscans who had a college there. Le Grand\nbecame a Franciscan Recollect friar prior to leaving for England as a\nmissionary in 1656. In England, he taught philosophy and theology,\nadvocating Catholicism and eventually Cartesianism, the latter being\nas unpopular as the former was perilous. It is not clear how Le Grand\ncame to Cartesianism, but the first evidence of his adoption of the\nnew philosophy was in his Institutio Philosophiae, published\nin London in 1672. His early works show affinities to the philosophies\nof Seneca and Epicurus. He is noted for his polemical exchanges with\nSamuel Parker and John Sergeant, and for having given\nDescartes\u2019s work a Scholastic form to further its acceptance in\nthe schools.\n",
