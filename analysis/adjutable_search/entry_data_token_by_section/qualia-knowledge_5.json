    "main_text": "Objections || Doubts about the Thought Experiment\n4.1 Doubts about the Thought Experiment\n\nSome authors have raised doubts about the thought experiment itself.\nIt is sometimes pointed out, for example, that merely confining Mary\nto a monochromatic environment would not prevent her from having color\nexperiences (see Thompson 1995, 264) or that, after release, she would\nnot be able to see colors. But the example can be refined to meet\nthese objections. Mary might be monochromatic from birth and changed\ninto a normal perceiver by some medical procedure. It is sometimes\nobjected that already accepted or future results of visual science are\nor might be incompatible with the existence of a Mary-case (a person\nwith monochromatic experience who becomes a normal color perceiver\nlater) or that such results might require (to preserve consistence\nwith visual science) the introduction of so many additional\nassumptions that the conceivability of the example becomes doubtful.\nTo this one might reply that the thought experiment need not be\ncompatible with visual science. If the case of a person with\nmonochromatic vision who turns into a normal perceiver really does\ninvolve serious difficulties for materialism, then the mere fact (if\nit were one) that our visual apparatus excludes the actual existence\nof such a case does not seem to provide a convincing reply for the\nmaterialist. But this point (the relevance or irrelevance of visual\nscience in this context) has not received much discussion in the\nliterature. It has, however, been pointed out (see Graham and Horgan,\n2000, footnote 4 with its reference to Shepard 1993) that at least\npresently available results of color vision science do not exclude a\nMary-case. (The psychologist Knut Nordby was a real life case of a\ncolor vision specialist who was also a complete achromat. See his\npaper \u2018Vision in a Complete Achromat: A Personal Account\u2019,\nlinked into in the Other Internet Resources section and Nordby,\n2007.)\n\nAnother doubt about the thought experiment is raised by the claim that\na person who is confined to a monochromatic environment but knows\neverything physical there is to know about visual color experience\nwould be able to figure out what colored things look like and thus\nwould e.g. be able to imagine the kind of color experience produced in\nnormal perceivers when looking at the cloudless sky during the day\n(see e.g. Dennett 1991; Dennett 2007; Churchland 1989; Maloney 1985,\n36). Probably the most common reaction to this is simply to doubt the\nclaim. But it is not clear that the claim, if correct, would undermine\nthe knowledge argument. The opponent would have to show that complete\nphysical knowledge necessarily involves the capacity to\nimagine blue. One may doubt that this claim is compatible with the\nwidely accepted assumption that physical knowledge can be acquired\nindependently of one\u2019s particular perceptual apparatus. (Arguably a\nsubject whose visual apparatus is not suited for visual experiences at\nall will not be able to develop the capacity to imagine colors on the\nbasis of physical knowledge alone, even if this were true for\nMary).\n\nSome have argued that Mary would recognize the colors when first\nseeing them on the basis of her complete physical knowledge about\ncolor vision (see Hardin 1992). According to this claim she would\nthink something like \u201coh, so this is red\u201d when first\nconfronted with a red patch and she could not be fooled by what\nDennett calls \u2018the blue banana trick\u2019: when shown a blue\nbanana she would know that it has the wrong color (see Dennett 1991).\nA possible and common response is to simply doubt these claims. But,\nin any case, it is not clear that these claims undermine the knowledge\nargument. One may respond along the following lines: If Mary when\nfirst confronted with red were able to conclude that she is now seeing\nwhat people call red, she thereby acquires a large set of\nnew beliefs about red experiences (that they are produced by\nroses, such-and-such wavelength combinations and so on). On the basis\nof seeing red she (a) acquires a new phenomenal concept of red and (b)\nshe forms new beliefs involving that new concept using her previously\nacquired physical knowledge. But if this description is correct, then\nher previous knowledge was incomplete (for a detailed discussion of\nDennett\u2019s argument involving the blue banana trick see Dale 1995).\n",
