Contrary to\ndream deception, Descartes emphasizes that the evil genius\nhypothesis is a mere fiction. Still, it radicalizes the dream\ndoubt in two respects. One, where the dream argument left the\nknowability of certain general truths intact, these are cast in doubt\nby the evil genius hypothesis. Two, where the dream argument,\nat least on the weaker reading, involves just temporary deception, the\nevil genius has us permanently deceived.\n\nOne modernized version, the brain-in-a-vat thought\nexperiment, says that if evil scientists placed your brain in a vat\nand stimulated it just right, your conscious experience would be\nexactly the same as if you were still an ordinary, embodied human\nbeing (Putnam 1981). In the Matrix-trilogy (Chalmers 2005),\nMatrixers live unbeknownst to themselves in a computer simulation.\nUnlike the brain-in-a-vat, they have bodies that are kept\nalive in pods, and flaws in the simulation allow some of them to bend\nits rules to their advantage.\n\nUnlike dream deception, which is often cast as a regularly recurring\nactuality (cf. Windt 2011), brain-in-a-vat-style arguments are often\nthought to be merely logically or nomologically possible. However,\nthere might be good reasons for thinking that we actually live in a\ncomputer simulation (Bostrom 2003), and if we lend some credence to\nradical skeptical scenarios, this may have consequences for how we act\n(Schwitzgebel 2017).\n\nEven purely hypothetical skeptical scenarios may enhance their\npsychological force by capitalizing on the analogy with dreams. Clark\n(2005) argues that the Matrix contains elements of\n\u201cindustrial-strength deception\u201d in which both sensory\nexperience and intellectual functioning are exactly the same as in\nstandard wake-states, whereas other aspects are more similar to the\ncompromised reasoning and bizarre shifts that are the hallmark of\ndreams.\n",
