    "main_text": "\n\nIn the early 1920s, the German mathematician David Hilbert\n(1862\u20131943) put forward a new proposal for the foundation of\nclassical mathematics which has come to be known as Hilbert\u2019s\nProgram. It calls for a formalization of all of mathematics in\naxiomatic form, together with a proof that this axiomatization of\nmathematics is consistent. The consistency proof itself was to be\ncarried out using only what Hilbert called \u201cfinitary\u201d\nmethods. The special epistemological character of finitary reasoning\nthen yields the required justification of classical mathematics.\nAlthough Hilbert proposed his program in this form only in 1921,\nvarious facets of it are rooted in foundational work of his going back\nuntil around 1900, when he first pointed out the necessity of giving a\ndirect consistency proof of analysis. Work on the program progressed\nsignificantly in the 1920s with contributions from logicians such as\nPaul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann, and Jacques\nHerbrand. It was also a great influence on\n Kurt G\u00f6del,\n whose work on the incompleteness theorems were motivated by\nHilbert\u2019s Program. G\u00f6del\u2019s work is generally taken to\nshow that Hilbert\u2019s Program cannot be carried out. It has\nnevertheless continued to be an influential position in the philosophy\nof mathematics, and, starting with the work of Gerhard Gentzen in the\n1930s, work on so-called Relativized Hilbert Programs have been\ncentral to the\n development of proof theory.\n",
