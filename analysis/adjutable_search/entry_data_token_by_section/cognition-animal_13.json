    "main_text": "Animal Cognition Applied to Philosophy || Social understanding\n3.6 Social understanding\n\nPhilosophical discussions on the nature of social understanding,\nincluding empathy, theory of mind, norms, and culture, have been\ninfluenced in the past couple of decades by the accumulating evidence\non the socio-cognitive capacities of animals. The chimpanzee theory of\nmind controversy, which we outlined in\n section 2,\n is a perfect illustration of this, since it gave rise to numerous\narticles and books that dealt with this topic from a philosophical\nperspective. Many of the early papers focused on what has been termed\nthe \u201clogical problem,\u201d which is the problem that the\nexperimental results can be interpreted by postulating that\nchimpanzees are mindreaders or that they are mere behavior-readers.\nPhilosophers have offered various solutions to this problem, ranging\nfrom experimental proposals that are meant to disentangle these two\nexplanations of the data (Lurz 2011) to attempts to dissolve it by\narguing that it is just a skeptical problem that will not help us\nadvance in our study of animal cognition (Halina 2015).\n\nOther philosophers have been inspired by the chimpanzee theory of mind\ncontroversy to rethink social cognition. Andrews (2012), for instance,\nargued that the chimpanzee theory of mind debate presupposes a view of\nsocial understanding according to which predicting and explaining\nbehavior are two symmetrical activities that depend on the attribution\nof propositional attitudes (beliefs and desires) to others. Instead,\nshe argues that in many cases humans and nonhumans alike can predict\nbehavior without appealing to someone\u2019s beliefs and desires,\npredicting instead from the situation in which the other is in, from\nwhat they themselves would do, based on stereotypes or personality\ntraits, from what that individual did in the past, from social norms,\nby perceiving the individual\u2019s emotional state, and so on. In\ncontrast, the attribution of mental states is more commonly found in\nthe practice of explaining the behavior of others, especially in the\ncase of anomalous behavior. Though chimpanzees and other apes have\nbeen found to pass a false belief task (Buttelmann et al. 2017;\nKrupenye et al. 2016), the chimpanzee theory of mind experiments have\nbeen designed to test for their capacity to predict behavior, not to\nexplain it, so they may not actually be probing into\nchimpanzees\u2019 theory of mind (Andrews 2018). Stephen Butterfill\nand Ian Apperly (2013) also argued that theory of mind tests that have\nbeen performed on children, apes, and other animals can be passed\nwithout attributing full-blown propositional attitudes to others. The\nindividuals can rely instead on what they call a \u201cminimal theory\nof mind,\u201d an ability to register objects and their relations to\nagents that allows one to track propositional attitudes without\nrepresenting them as such. While much of the current discussion of ape\ntheory of mind is methodological, raising worries about the nonverbal\nimplicit methods used in these tests (Horschler, MacLean, & Santos\n2020), there are also philosophical questions to be asked about a\nconstruct that has arisen from the nonverbal tests, namely,\nimplicit belief representation. Implicit knowledge is often\ntaken to be nonrepresentational, as seen in the philosophical\nliterature on knowledge how. To address the questions of what it means\nto say a nonverbal infant or nonhuman animal has a theory of mind\nrequires some conceptual clarifications (Rakoczy 2012).\n\nPhilosophers have more recently been interested in a wider array of\nsocial capacities. Philosophical accounts of social learning (Moore\n2013), culture (Goodrich 2017; Ramsey 2013), innovation (Ramsey,\nBastian, & van Schaik 2007), social norms (Andrews 2020a), and\nanimal morality (Fitzpatrick 2017b; Korsgaard 2006; Mons\u00f3 2015;\nRowlands 2012) are also topics that are informed by current research\nin animal cognition.\n",
