    "main_text": "Spatiotemporal relations and spacetime points\n4. Spatiotemporal relations and spacetime points\n\nThe foregoing Almost-Lewisian thesis about spatiotemporal relations is\ntoo strong to be tenable: we now have reasonably good reasons, drawn\nfrom quantum physics, for holding that even in the actual world, there\nare perfectly natural relations other than the purely spatiotemporal\nones. (Roughly: the relations\u2014whatever exactly they amount\nto\u2014coded up in the quantum mechanical wave-function.) Two points\nin its defense are, however, worth brief mention: First, seemingly\nobvious counterexamples\u2014involving such basic physical relations\nas being more massive than\u2014in fact aren\u2019t\ncounterexamples, since Lewis can deny that they are genuinely\nfundamental or perfectly natural, on the basis that facts\nabout their obtaining reduce to facts about the distribution of\nmonadic perfectly natural properties. (Still, they will certainly turn\nout to be very natural.) Second, if we could at least\nmaintain, as a contingent thesis, that the only perfectly\nnatural relations are spatiotemporal ones, then we could plausibly\nsettle an unresolved and deeply vexed question about the content of\nphysicalism (the doctrine, to put it rather too crudely, that all\nthere is to the actual world is physical stuff), as explained in\nthe supplementary document\n\nPhysicalism\n\n\nAt any rate, the thesis that spatiotemporal relations are at least\namong the perfectly natural relations allows us to clarify\nand simplify Almost-Lewis\u2019s position. Specifically, we can say\nthat all that it comes to to say that the fundamental entities are\nspacetime points is that they stand in perfectly natural\nspatiotemporal relations to one another. For more, see the\nsupplementary document on\n\nSpacetime Points\n\n\nTo say that they are spacetime points, finally, is to say\nthat they have no proper parts.\n\nOne upshot is that my original statement of Almost-Lewis\u2019s\nontology needs an amendment: for it was misleading to say that\naccording to him, the fundamental particulars are spacetime\npoints. That\u2019s true, but it wrongly suggests that he is making a\nchoice of one fundamental kind of particular, distinguished\nfrom other possible choices by the essential nature of its members.\nNot so. It is more accurate to describe his fundamental ontology\nthus:\n\nThere are particulars.\nThey are, or are wholly composed of,\nsimples\u2014particulars have no other particulars as proper\nparts.\nThese simples have various perfectly natural monadic\nproperties.\nThey stand in various spatiotemporal relations to one\nanother.\nAnd that is all.\n\n",
