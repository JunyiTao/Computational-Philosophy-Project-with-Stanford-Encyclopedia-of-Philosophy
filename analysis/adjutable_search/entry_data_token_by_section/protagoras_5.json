    "main_text": "Protagoras on Language || Protagoras\u2019 grammatical interests\n3.1 Protagoras\u2019 grammatical interests\n\nSeveral testimonies report Protagoras\u2019 interest on\nmorphological, syntactic, and stylistic issues. Apparently, he was the\nfirst to distinguish the gender of nouns (male, female, and neuter)\nwhile also proposing many corrections for names in use in his day.\nThus he suggested that the female nouns menis\n(\u03bc\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2, \u201cwrath\u201d, \u201cfrenzy\u201d)\nand pelex (\u03c0\u03ae\u03bb\u03b7\u03be,\n\u201chelmet\u201d), two terms familiar to Homer\u2019s audience,\nshould be regarded as masculine\u2014either on the basis of\nmorphological criteria (because names ending in sigma [\u03c2] or xi\n[\u03be] are usually masculine) or because of their meaning (insofar as\nwar is an eminently masculine pursuit: see 80A27-8 DK). Protagoras\nalso distinguished four verbal modes (indicative, conjunctive,\noptative, and imperative), which he linked to four types of speech\n(prayer, question, reply, and command), once again taking the occasion\nto mention Homer, who had addressed the goddess with a command\n(\u201cSing, Goddess, the wrath\u201d) rather than a prayer (80A29\nDK). Finally, Diogenes Laertius (IX 52 = 80A1 DK) seems to inform us\nof Protagoras\u2019 interest in verb tenses (but this is more\ncontroversial). All in all, these grammatical reflections presuppose a\n\u201crudimentary\u201d (Rademaker 2013: 86) theory of language,\nwhich is not limited to names but is rather investigated from the\npoint of view of its underlying structure and connections in relation\nto the different functions of terms.\n\nThis interest on language did not depend on exclusively erudite or\ngrammatical interests, as though Protagoras simply sought to codify or\nstandardise the linguistic usages of the Greek world. On the contrary,\npractical and philosophical interests were in play. On the one hand,\nit was a matter of increasing the potential of words in view of the\npractical aim of teaching pupils to exploit language to further their\ngoals: it is by mastering a language that one can use it more\neffectively. This is what happens in the Clouds; as Aristophanes\nwas to note, these are the tools that help \u201cmake the weaker\nargument the stronger\u201d (80B6b DK): in order to learn the\n\u201cunjust argument\u201d (Aristophanes\u2019 version of\nProtagoras\u2019 \u201cweaker argument\u201d), one must first learn\nthe rules of grammar (Clouds, 658\u2013691 = 80C3 DK).\nBesides, criticism of Homer is also a way to challenge the\npoet\u2019s authority. From the surviving testimonies it appears that\nan important part of Protagoras\u2019 teaching was devoted to the\ninterpretation of poets such as Homer, Simonides (see Plato\u2019s\nProtagoras 339a\u2013e) and Hesiod (see below\n \u00a75).\n Clearly, the purpose is not to provide a mere exegesis. Rather, it is\nto critically discuss the text and fulfil an educational goal:\nliterary criticism is a useful intellectual exercise which enables the\nindividual to grow familiar with and eventually criticise traditional\nvalues which were conveyed by the poets (Morgan 2000: 89\u201394).\nThe sophist\u2019s strategy is one of appropriation, where an\nengagement with traditional knowledge represents the starting point of\ntheir attempt to acquire a dominant position in the Athenian cultural\nscene. In such a way, Protagoras could reinforce his claim to be a new\nteacher, an educator capable of imparting teachings suited to the\nneeds of the new world of the\n polis.[2]\n",
