    "main_text": "Homo Economicus and Expected Utility Theory || Descriptions, Prescriptions, and Normative Standards\n1.4 Descriptions, Prescriptions, and Normative Standards\n\nIt is commonplace to contrast how people render judgments, or make\ndecisions, from how they ought to do so. However, interest in\ncognitive processes, mechanisms, and algorithms of boundedly rational\njudgment and decision making suggests that we instead distinguish\namong three aims of inquiry rather than these two. Briefly, a\ndescriptive theory aims to explain or predict what judgments\nor decisions people in fact make; a prescriptive theory aims\nto explain or recommend what judgments or decisions people ought to\nmake; a normative theory aims to specify a normative standard\nto use in evaluating a judgment or decision.\n\nTo illustrate each type, consider a domain where differences between\nthese three lines of inquiry are especially clear: arithmetic. A\ndescriptive theory of arithmetic might concern the psychology of\narithmetical reasoning, a model of approximate numeracy in animals, or\nan algorithm for implementing arbitrary-precision arithmetic on a\ndigital computer. The normative standard of full arithmetic is\nPeano\u2019s axiomatization of arithmetic, which distills natural\nnumber arithmetic down to a function for one number succeeding another\nand mathematical induction. But one might also consider\nRobinson\u2019s induction-free fragment of Peano arithmetic (Tarski,\nMostowski, & Robinson 1953) or axioms for some system of cardinal\narithmetic in the hierarchy for large cardinals. A prescriptive theory\nfor arithmetic will reference both a fixed normative standard and\nrelevant facts about the arithmetical capabilities of the organism or\nmachine performing arithmetic. A curriculum for improving the\narithmetical performance of elementary school children will differ\nfrom one designed to improve the performance of adults. Even though\nthe normative standard of Peano arithmetic is the same for both\nchildren and adults, stable psychological differences in these two\npopulations may warrant prescribing different approaches for improving\ntheir arithmetic. Continuing, even though Peano\u2019s axioms are the\nnormative standard for full arithmetic, nobody would prescribe\nPeano\u2019s axioms for the purpose of improving anyone\u2019s sums.\nThere is no mistaking Peano\u2019s axioms for a descriptive theory of\narithmetical reasoning, either. Even so, a descriptive theory of\narithmetic will presuppose the Peano axioms as the normative standard\nfor full arithmetic, even if only implicitly. In describing how people\nsum two numbers, after all, one presumes that they are attempting to\nsum two numbers rather than concatenate them, count out in sequence,\nor send a message in code.\n\nFinally, imagine an effective pedagogy for teaching arithmetic to\nchildren is known and we wish to introduce children to cardinal\narithmetic. A reasonable start on a prescriptive theory for cardinal\narithmetic for children might be to adapt as much of the successful\npedagogy for full arithmetic as possible while anticipating that some\nof those methods will not survive the change in normative standards\nfrom Peano to (say) ZFC+. Some of those differences can be seen as a\ndirect consequence of the change from one standard to another, while\nother differences may arise unexpectedly from the observed interplay\nbetween the change in task, that is, from performing full arithmetic\nto performing cardinal arithmetic, and the psychological capabilities\nof children to perform each task.\n\nTo be sure, there are important differences between arithmetic and\nrational behavior. The objects of arithmetic, numerals and the numbers\nthey refer to, are relatively clear cut, whereas the objects of\nrational behavior vary even when the same theoretical machinery is\nused. Return to expected utility theory as an example. An agent may be\nviewed as deliberating over options with the aim to choose one that\nmaximizes his personal welfare, or viewed to act as if he deliberately\ndoes so without actually doing so, or understood to do nothing of the\nkind but to instead be a bit part player in the population fitness of\nhis kind.\n\nSeparating the question of how to choose a normative standard from\nquestions about how to evaluate or describe behavior is an important\ntool to reduce misunderstandings that arise in discussions of bounded\nrationality. Even though Peano\u2019s axioms would never be\nprescribed to improve, nor proposed to describe, arithmetical\nreasoning, it does not follow that the Peano axioms of arithmetic are\nirrelevant to descriptive and prescriptive theories of arithmetic.\nWhile it remains an open question whether the normative standards for\nhuman rational behavior admit axiomatization, there should be little\ndoubt over the positive role that clear normative standards play in\nadvancing our understanding of how people render judgments, or make\ndecisions, and how they ought to do so.\n",
