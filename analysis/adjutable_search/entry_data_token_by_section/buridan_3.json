    "main_text": "Logic\n4. Logic\n\n\nFollowing Aristotle and Porphyry, Buridan's logic is based on two\ndistinct, but complementary, conceptions of its purpose: theoretical or\npedagogical (logica docens) and practical (logica\n utens).[13]\n The former, he says, is so called because \u201cit teaches\n[docet] us how, and from what [materials], arguments should\nbe constructed, whether those arguments be demonstrative, dialectical,\nor of some other kind\u201d. The latter takes its name from the fact\nthat \u201cit uses [utitur] arguments in order to prove\nwhether some conclusion is evident, regardless of the subject matter\nof the conclusion\u201d (QIP 1: 126\u20137, ll.176\u201380). But since the\nteaching of logic is ordained to its use, Buridan holds that logic is\nultimately a practical rather than a speculative discipline.\n\n\nHistorians of logic usually classify Buridan among the terminists or\n\u2018moderns\u2019, a diverse group of thirteenth and\nfourteenth-century logicians who regarded the semantic properties of\nterms (literally, the \u2018ends [termini]\u2019, or\nsubjects and predicates, of propositions) as the primary unit of\nlogical analysis.  As we saw above, in addition to commenting on\nAristotle's Organon, he wrote a logical compendium, the\nSummulae de dialectica, ostensibly as a commentary on Peter\nof Spain's Summulae logicales, an influential terminist\ntextbook written a century earlier. But Buridan's Summulae\nwas essentially a new work, more that ten times longer than the\noriginal and featuring many new and completely rewritten sections. In\nit, Buridan leads his students and readers through an orderly\nprogression of teachings, beginning with propositions (Treatise I),\nshifting down to the signification and referential function of their\ncomponent terms (II-IV), then back up to terms and propositions\ninsofar as they figure in more complex patterns of reasoning:\nsyllogisms (V), topics (VI), fallacies (VII), and finally,\ndemonstrations (VIII). The work concludes with a kind of exercise book\non paradoxical and otherwise puzzling propositions, showing how they\ncan be resolved using the techniques of the previous eight\ntreatises.\n\n\nNo encyclopedia article can do justice to the richness and variety of\nBuridan's logic; it was interest in logic that first revived the study\nof his work fifty years ago, and logic remains the one area in which\nBuridan can speak directly to modern philosophical audiences.  The\nmain reason for this is that Buridan's project of developing a\ntoken-based semantics to ground his nominalist ontology is shared by\nmany philosophers of language today; likewise, the method of\nhis Treatise on Consequences has been rightly described by\nHubert Hubien as \u201cvery modern: we have here what is without doubt the\nfirst attempt, albeit very imperfect, at an axiomatic exposition of\nlogic on the basis of the propositional\ncalculus.\u201d[14]\nNevertheless, this section will have the more modest aim of showing\nshowing how Buridan practiced the dialectical art and influenced logic\nand semantics well into the sixteenth century.\n\n\nFirst, Buridan did much to streamline and better articulate the\nmethods of terminist logic. The most important analytical tool in the\nSummulae is the doctrine of suppositio\n[supposition], which had been a feature of terminist logic for several\ngenerations by the time Buridan arrived in Paris. Terms were thought\nto possess two general semantic properties: signification, or what a\nterm \u2018makes known\u2019 in the mind of the person who sees it\nor hears it or conceives of it, whether mediately or immediately\n(thus, the written term \u2018Socrates\u2019 brings to mind the\nconcept of Socrates, which in turn signifies the actual person); and\nsupposition, which refers to the capacity of certain substantive terms\nto stand for or \u2018pick out\u2019 something in a particular\ncontext, such as in a proposition. Although the analogy is not\nperfect, supposition performs many of the same functions as what we\nwould call the theory of\n reference.[15]\n Traditional accounts divided supposition into proper supposition,\nwhere a term is used with its typical or standard meaning, and\nimproper supposition, where a term is used in some metaphorical or\nfigurative sense. Most logicians went on to distinguish three kinds of\nproper supposition: personal, where a term stands for what it\nsignifies (e.g., \u2018Socrates\u2019 in \u2018Socrates is a\nman\u2019); material, where it stands for itself (e.g.,\n\u2018man\u2019 in \u2018Man has three letters\u2019); and simple,\nwhere it stands for a common nature or concept (e.g.,\n\u2018man\u2019 in \u2018Man is a species\u2019). Simple\nsupposition appears to have been a vestige of early terminist\n logic,[16]\n whose realist practitioners needed to distinguish between referring\nto a universal thing and referring to a particular thing. But by the\nfourteenth century, the whole notion of universals had become more\ncontroversial, and nominalist logicians in particular were not about\nto accept any special device for referring to them through common\nterms such as \u2018man\u2019. So simple supposition was readapted\nto model reference to common concepts or intentions. Thus, Ockham\nholds that a term exhibits simple supposition when it supposits\n\u201cfor a concept in the mind [pro conceptu\nmentis],\u201d and is not being used\n significatively.[17]\n What united Ockham and his terminist predecessors was their\nrealization that if the proposition \u2018Man is a species\u2019 is\nto be true, then the term \u2018man\u2019 cannot supposit personally\nfor any of the individual men it ultimately signifies, since it cannot\nbe said of any of them that he is a species (Socrates is a man, not a\nspecies).  Accordingly, the reference of \u2018man\u2019 must be to\na common nature or concept.\n\n\nBut Buridan contends that there are only two ways a term can stand\nfor something in a proposition, personally and materially:\nOf the first [section on the divisions of supposition], we\nshould realize that some people have posited also a third member,\nwhich they call \u2018simple supposition\u2019. For they [e.g.,\nPeter of Spain] held that universal natures are distinct from the\nsingulars outside of the soul. And so they said that a term supposits\npersonally when it supposits for the singulars themselves, that it\nsupposits simply when it supposits for that material nature, and\nmaterially when it supposits for itself. But I hold that Aristotle\ncorrectly refuted that opinion in the seventh book of the\nMetaphysics [VII.3.1038b1\u20131039a23] and so this kind of\nsupposition has to be eliminated, at least according to this\ninterpretation. In another manner, others [e.g., Ockham] call\nsupposition \u2018simple\u2019 when an utterance supposits for the\nconcept according to which it is imposed and material when it\nsupposits for itself or another similar to itself. And this can be\npermitted, but I do not care [about this usage], for I call both\n\u2018material supposition\u2019. (S 4.3.2: 253)\n\n\nBuridan sees that it is misleading to assign a special logical sense\nto terms being used to refer to themselves or to the concepts they\nexpress, as if this were any different from figurative or metaphorical\nusage, since only terms that refer to things existing per se\nare being used in their proper sense. Thus, terms can stand either for\nthe things they ordinarily signify, in which case they supposit\npersonally, or for something else, in which case they supposit\nmaterially. Material supposition applies whenever a term is used in\nsome way that departs from the meaning imposed upon it by the\nlinguistic community:\nan utterance does not have any proper import [virtus\npropria] in signifying and suppositing, except from ourselves. So\nby an agreement of the disputing parties, as in obligational disputes,\nwe can impose on it a new signification, and not use it according to\nits common signification. We can also speak figuratively\n[transsumptive] and ironically, according to a different\nsignification. But we call a locution \u2018proper\u2019 when we use\nit according to the signification properly and principally given to it,\nand we call a locution \u2018improper\u2019 when we use it otherwise,\nalthough we legitimately can use it otherwise. So it is absurd to say\nthat a proposition of an author is false, absolutely speaking, if he\nputs it forth incorporating an improper locution, according to which it\nis true. Instead, we ought to say that it is true, since it is\nenunciated according to the sense in which it is true. (S 4.3.2:\n256)\n\n\nNotice that the default interpretation of a term is its proper\nsense, defined as \u201cthe signification properly and principally\ngiven to it\u201d. The proper signification of a term must be based on\nthe fact that \u201cutterances were primarily and principally imposed\nto signify so as to stand for their ultimate significata, and\nnot for themselves\u201d (S 4.3.2:\n 256);[18]\n that is to say, just as concepts (at least in the first instance)\nnaturally signify those extra-mental things that just as naturally\ngive rise to them, so spoken and written terms (at least in the first\ninstance) are imposed to signify, via their corresponding concepts,\nthe same ultimate\n significata.[19]\n For Buridan, this capacity is natural to us as creatures endowed with\nthe power of cognition. It is why he insists that determining the\nnature of concepts pertains not to logic but to psychology or\nmetaphysics, speculative sciences whose conclusions cannot be\notherwise (QDI I.3:6, ll.\n 4\u201310).[20]\n So even if we say that the proposition, \u2018Man is a\nspecies\u2019 is true insofar as it is put forward in the context of\nAristotle's Categories, it is not literally true, or true\naccording to \u201cthe signification properly and principally given\nto it\u201d, because of no per se existing man is it true to\nsay that he is a species. What happens is that when we work on the\nCategories, we follow Aristotle's lead and depart from\nconventional usage in such a way that the term \u2018man\u2019\nsupposits not for individual men but for the universal concept\naccording to which it was imposed to signify, in which case the\nproposition is true because \u201cspecies and genera are universals\naccording to predication\u201d (S 4.3.2: 254). So it can be true that\nman is a species without it being literally true that man is\na species.\n\n\nThe second way in which Buridan changed the dialectical landscape\nwas to extend the range of traditional logic. There are numerous\nexamples of this, not all of which are uncontroversial because it is often\nhard to tell what Buridan intended to achieve by a given innovation\n(this goes for other medieval logicians as\n well).[21]\n But a fairly uncontroversial example can be found in his use of\nsupposition to examine the structure of certain complex terms that\nwould remain unanalyzed on the traditional account of syllogistic\ninferences. Of particular importance here is the doctrine of\nampliation. Thus, although the syllogism, \u2018Nothing dead is an\nanimal, some man is dead; therefore, some man is not an animal\u2019,\nis an acceptable fourth-mode syllogism of the first figure\n(Ferio), Buridan denies that the consequence is\n\u201cformally valid\u201d. The reason is that in this syllogism,\n\u2018man\u2019 is an ampliative term, and \u201cfrom an ampliated\nnondistributed term the same term does not follow nonampliated\u201d\nthat is, \u201cin the minor proposition the term \u2018man\u2019\nwas ampliated to past [things], whereas in the conclusion it was not\nampliated,\u201d making the premises true but the conclusion false (S\n5.3.2: 326; cf. QAnPr I.14). Similarly, terms referring to the divine\npersons sometimes generate counterexamples to the traditionally\naccepted modes. Thus, \u201cthe following syllogism in\nBarbara is invalid: \u2018Every God is the son, every divine\nFather is God; therefore every divine Father is the Son\u201d, for\nthe transitivity of identity fails in cases \u201cwhere the most\nsimple unity is a trinity of really distinct persons\u201d (S 5.3.2:\n327). Buridan also urges the reader to be wary of modal contexts\nintroduced by verbs of knowing and believing because \u201cthe verb\n\u2018know\u2019 ampliates the subject to supposit not only for\npresent things, but also for future and past ones\u201d. This means\nthat without suitable qualification, \u201calthough I know that every\nman is an animal, nevertheless, it does not follow that every man is\nknown by me to be an animal; for then it would follow that every man,\nwhether alive or dead or yet to be born, would be known by me to be an\nanimal, which is false\u201d (S 5.6.8: 348). What is noteworthy in\nthese and other examples is Buridan's use of the doctrine of\nsupposition to extend the range of \u2018truth-makers\u2019 for\nmodal inferences, e.g., in his assumption that \u201cthe presence of\na modal copula\u2014any modal copula\u2014in a proposition\nampliates the subject to stand for not only the actual things but also\nthe possible things that fall under that\n term\u201d.[22]\n Because it makes merely possible objects relevant to the evaluation\nof modal inferences, ampliation can be seen as a kind of Buridanian\nequivalent of possible worlds semantics, though it would be a mistake\nto regard it as a remarkable anticipation of that twentieth-century\ndoctrine. Buridan's remarks on its theoretical significance are\n few,[23]\n and, despite the degree of technical sophistication involved, he\nprobably did not see it as a radical innovation, but as part of his\nongoing effort to make existing schemes for checking inferences more\npracticable.\n\n\nThird, and finally, Buridan made major contributions to certain\nforms of logical inquiry that originated in the medieval period. Most\nmodern logicians know of his solutions to alethic paradoxes such as the\nLiar, addressed in the eighth and final chapter of ninth\ntreatise of the Summulae, which belongs to the medieval\nliterature of sophismata or\n insolubilia.[24]\n The 7th sophism Buridan considers is \u2018Every proposition is\nfalse\u2019.  The case posits \u201cthat all true propositions are\nannihilated while the false ones remain [in existence], and then\nSocrates propounds only this [proposition]: \u2018Every proposition\nis false\u2019\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism: 965). The question is then\nasked whether Socrates's proposition is true or false. The arguments\non each side of the question illustrate the difficulties one faces if\n\u2018true\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 are interpreted\nstrictly. The argument that it is false assumes that \u201cit is\nimpossible for the same proposition to be true and false when\npropounded in the same language and understood in the same way by\neveryone hearing it\u201d, and proceeds to argue that the sophism is\nfalse because any proposition which entails its own contradictory is\nimpossible, and therefore false. The opposite side begins by focusing\non the logical form of the sophism as a universal affirmative that has\nno counter-instance in the case at hand, which stated that all true\npropositions have been annihilated with only the false ones\nremaining. Second, the sophism must be true because the subject and\npredicate terms supposit for the same things: if every proposition is\nfalse, then each and every propositional significate of the term\n\u2018every proposition\u2019 must be false, as it indeed is,\naccording to the case. Finally, the sophism must be true because\n\u201cit signifies only that every proposition is false; and this is\nhow things are [ita est]\u201d, according to the case (S\n9.8, 7th sophism: 965).\n\n\nBuridan writes as if this particular sophism enjoyed some notoriety\namong logic teachers at Paris, although all but one of the alternative\nsolutions he mentions were discussed and criticized from the very\nbeginning of the insolubilia literature. These involve various\nad hoc proposals that either build new assumptions into the\ncase or else make up new rules about how the terms of the sophism are\nto be\n interpreted.[25]\n Into the first category falls a solution known as the\n\u2018transcasus\u2019, which involves the bizarre\nsuggestion that the time Socrates utters his proposition and the time\nreferred to by the verb of the proposition are not the same.  This\nwould allow us to say that if there are no true propositions during\nthe first hour of a certain day, Socrates could utter his proposition\nat the end of this hour and it would be true, where he is understood\nas referring \u201cnot to the time at which he speaks but to the time\nof that first hour\u201d. But this is of no help if we stick to the\ncase and assume that the times are the same.  Alternatively, in a\nsolution advocated by the \u2018restringentes\n[restrictors]\u2019\u2014so-called because they avoided self-reference\nby restricting what a term can supposit for\u2014we could make the\nproposition non-reflexive by stipulating that \u201cterms that are\napt to supposit for propositions are not put in propositions to\nsupposit for the propositions in which they are put, but for\nothers\u201d. But Buridan rightly rejects this second strategy as\nfailing to take seriously our conventional understanding of terms, for\nwhen one uses the term \u2018proposition\u2019, he says, \u201cone\nunderstands indifferently all propositions, indeed, present, past, and\nfuture ones, his own as well as those of another person\u201d. A\nmoment's reflection should make it obvious that \u201cthis solution\nis worth nothing: for what one understands, of that he can speak\n[quod aliquis intelligit, de hoc potest loqui]\u201d (S 9.8,\n7th sophism:\n 966).[26]\n\n\nBuridan's quick answer to the sophism is that Socrates's proposition\nis false in the case at hand. But before moving on to his final answer,\nhe first discusses a solution described as being held by some people,\nincluding\n himself.[27]\n This is that there is another condition, in addition to the\nrequirement that its terms stand for the same thing or things, which a\nproposition must meet if it is to be true. A proposition must also\nsignify or assert itself to be true (S 9.8, 7th sophism:\n 967).[28]\n In her detailed analysis of this sophism,\nFabienne Pironet has shown that the text in which Buridan defends this\nearlier view is his question commentary on Aristotle's Posterior\nAnalytics, where it is expressed in terms of the traditional\nformula that \u201chowsoever [a proposition] signifies, so it is\n[qualitercumque significat, ita est]\u201d (QAnPo\n I.10).[29]\n Now Buridan holds that all propositions satisfy this condition\ntrivially: \u201cevery proposition by its form signifies or asserts\nitself to be true\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism: 967). The problem with\nself-referential paradoxes is that they also seem to signify that they\nare false. Thus, although the proposition \u2018I say what is false\n[ego dico falsum]\u2019 \u201csignifies itself to be true\nin some fashion, nevertheless this is not so entirely, or howsoever it\nsignifies [licet aliqualiter sic significat, non tamen totaliter\nvel qualitercumque ita est].  Therefore it is false\u201d (QAnPo\nI.10).\n\n\nUnfortunately, this looks no less ad hoc than the\ntranscasus and restriction solutions he has just criticized.\nWhy shouldn't other propositions, besides the paradoxical ones, be\nable to signify that they are false? Buridan does not say in his\ncommentary on the Posterior Analytics, and in the\nSummulae he rejects his earlier view for the rather different\nreason that it is false \u201cthat every proposition signifies or\nasserts itself to be true\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism: 968). His\nargument is not exactly clear, but the problem appears to be semantic:\nhe cannot find an interpretation of the phrase \u2018itself to be\ntrue [se esse veram]\u2019 in the supplementary condition\nthat will permit it to function as a general principle. Consider the\nproposition \u2018A man is an animal [homo est\nanimal]\u2019. If we understand it materially, i.e., as standing\nfor a proposition, then it will signify \u2018The proposition\n\u201cA man is an animal\u201d is true\u2019, which is false\nbecause it refers to second intentions (concepts or signs by means of\nwhich we conceive of other concepts or signs as such), and the\noriginal proposition refers to things (human beings and animals), not\nconcepts. But what if we say that a proposition signifies itself to be\ntrue if it is taken significatively for the things or first\nintentions, rather than materially? This will not work either, argues\nBuridan, because then the affirmative proposition \u2018A man is a\ndonkey [homo est asinus]\u2019 would signify that a man is a\ndonkey, which is false because the subject term \u2018man\u2019 does\nnot supposit for anything (no human beings are\n donkeys).[30]\n Accordingly, we cannot base our solution to self-referential\nparadoxes on the idea that every proposition signifies or asserts\nitself to be\n true.[31]\n\n\nThe solution Buridan finally settles on receives the somewhat tepid\nendorsement of being \u201ccloser to the truth\u201d than the\nprevious solution\u2014a reflection, perhaps, of his awareness of the\nimperfectability of any formal system that tries to stick close to the\nfacts of human language. Here, the idea that a proposition formally\nsignifies itself to be true is replaced by the notion of implication\nfrom the doctrine of consequences. \u201cEvery proposition,\u201d he\nsays, \u201cvirtually implies another proposition in which the\npredicate \u2018true\u2019 is affirmed of the subject that supposits\nfor [the original proposition]\u201d (S 9.8, 7th sophism:\n 969).[32]\n Unlike the old solution, in which the second proposition is signified\nby the first and hence part of its meaning, the new solution assumes\nonly that the second proposition follows logically from the first, so\nthat its meaning can be expounded separately. In this way, for the\ntruth of any proposition P, it is required not only (1) that the\nsubject and predicate terms of P stand for the same thing or\n things,[33]\n but also (2) that P implies another proposition,\n\u2018P is true\u2019, which must also be true. Otherwise,\nwe would have a true antecedent and a false consequent, violating\nBuridan's fifth theorem regarding assertoric consequences, which\nstates, \u201cit is impossible for what is false to follow from what\nis true [impossibile est ex veris sequi falsum]\u201d (TC\nI.8: 34, l. 97; Read (tr.) 2015: 77\u201378). Applying this to the 7th sophism, the constituent\nterms in the proposition uttered by Socrates\u2014\u2018Every\nproposition\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019\u2014stand for the same\nthings, since in the posited case, \u201call true propositions are\nannihilated and the false ones remain, and then Socrates propounds\nonly this: \u2018Every proposition is false\u2019\u201d. So the\nfirst condition is satisfied. But the implied proposition,\n\u2018P is true\u2019 (where P is the name of\n\u2018Every proposition is false\u2019), is false because its\nconstituent terms, \u2018Every proposition is false\u2019 and\n\u2018true\u2019, do not stand for the same thing, since ex\nhypothesi, P stands for the antecedent proposition\n\u2018Every proposition is false\u2019, not for things that are\ntrue. But this gives us a true antecedent and a false consequent, and\nso the consequence does not hold. Therefore, the sophism is false.\n",
