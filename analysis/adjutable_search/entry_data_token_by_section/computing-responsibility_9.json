    "main_text": "Rethinking the concept of moral responsibility || Assigning responsibility\n3.1 Assigning responsibility\n\nOne approach is to rethink how moral responsibility is assigned\n(Gotterbarn 2001; Waelbers 2009). When it comes to computing\npractitioners, Gotterbarn identifies a potential to side-step or avoid\nresponsibility by looking for someone else to blame. He attributes\nthis potential to two pervasive misconceptions about responsibility.\nThe first misconception is that computing is an ethically neutral\npractice. That is, according to Gotterbarn, the misplaced belief that\ntechnological artifacts and the practices of building them are\nethically neutral is often used to justify a narrow\ntechnology-centered focus on the development of computer system\nwithout taking the broader context in which these technologies operate\ninto account. This narrow focus can have detrimental consequences.\nGotterbarn gives the tragic case of a patient\u2019s death as a\nresult of a faulty X-ray device as an example. A programmer was given\nthe assignment to write a program that could lower or raise the X-ray\ndevice on a pole, after an X-ray technician set the required height.\nThe programmer focused on solving the given puzzle, but failed to take\naccount of the circumstances in which the device would be used and the\ncontingencies that might occur. He, thus, did not consider the\npossibility that a patient could accidentally be in the way of the\ndevice moving up and down the pole. This oversight eventually resulted\nin a tragic accident. A patient was crushed by the device, when a\ntechnician set the device to tabletop height, not realizing that the\npatient was still underneath it. According to Gotterbarn, computer\npractitioners have a moral responsibility to consider such\ncontingencies, even though they may not be legally required to do so.\nThe design and use of technological artifacts is a moral activity and\nthe choice for one particular design solution over another has real\nand material consequences.\n\nThe second misconception is that responsibility is only about\ndetermining blame when something goes wrong. Computer practitioners,\naccording to Gotterbarn, have conventionally adopted a malpractice\nmodel of responsibility that focuses on determining the appropriate\nperson to blame for harmful incidents (2001). This malpractice model\nleads to all sorts of excuses to shirk responsibility. In particular,\nthe complexities that computer technologies introduce allow computer\npractitioners to side-step responsibility. The distance between\ndevelopers and the effects of the use of the technologies they create\ncan, for instance, be used to claim that there is no direct and\nimmediate causal link that would tie developers to a malfunction.\nDevelopers can argue that their contribution to the chain of events\nwas negligible, as they are part of a team or larger organization and\nthey had limited opportunity to do otherwise. The malpractice model,\naccording to Gotterbarn, entices computer practitioners to distance\nthemselves from accountability and blame.\n\nThe two misconceptions are based on a particular retrospective view of\nresponsibility that places the focus on that which exempts one from\nblame and liability. In reference to Ladd, Gotterbarn calls this\nnegative responsibility and distinguishes it from positive\nresponsibility (see also Ladd 1989). Positive responsibility\nemphasizes \u201cthe virtue of having or being obliged to have regard\nfor the consequences that his or her actions have on others\u201d\n(Gotterbarn 2001, p. 227). Positive responsibility entails that part\nof the professionalism of computer experts is that they strive to\nminimize foreseeable undesirable events. It focuses on what ought to\nbe done rather than on blaming or punishing others for irresponsible\nbehavior. Gotterbarn argues that the computing professions should\nadopt a positive concept of responsibility, as it emphasizes the\nobligations and duties of computer practitioners to have regard for\nthe consequences of one\u2019s actions and to minimize the\npossibility of causing harm. Computer practitioners have a moral\nresponsibility to avoid harm and to deliver a properly working\nproduct, according to him, regardless of whether they will be held\naccountable if things turn out differently.\n\nThe emphasis on the positive moral responsibility of computer\npractitioners raises the question of how far this responsibility\nreaches, in particular in light of systems that many hands help create\nand the difficulties involved in anticipating contingencies that might\ncause a system to malfunction (Stieb 2008; Miller 2008). To what\nextent can developers and manufacturers be expected to exert\nthemselves to anticipate or prevent the consequences of the use of\ntheir technologies or possible \u2018bugs\u2019 in their code?\nComputer systems today are generally incomprehensible to any single\nprogrammer and it seems unlikely that complex computer systems can be\ncompletely error free. Martin argues in this respect that developers\nand the companies that decide to sell a computer technology\ninto a particular context are responsible for the ethical\nimplication of the use of these technologies in that context (2019).\nThey are responsible for these implications because they are\nknowledgeable about the design decisions and are in a unique position\nto inscribe in the technology particular ideas (and biases) about what\nthe technology should do and how it should do it. Thus, a company that\ncreates and sells a risk-assessment system into the context of\njudicial decision-making is responsible for the ethical implications\nof biases resulting from its use and its opaqueness. The company\nwillingly \u201ctakes on the obligation to understand the values of\nthe decision to ensure the algorithms\u2019 ethical implications is\ncongruent with the context\u201d (p. 10). This, however, leaves open\nthe question of what their responsibility is outside of that context.\nShould manufacturers of mobile phones have anticipated that their\nproducts would be used in roadside bombs? Manufacturers and their\ndesigners and engineers cannot foresee all the possible conditions\nunder which their products will eventually operate. Moreover, how much\ncontrol should a person have to be or feel responsible for the outcome\nof events? Such questions speak to what Santonio de Sio and Meccaci\n(2020) call the \u201cactive responsibility gap\u201d. They\ndescribed active responsibility in much the same way as positive\nresponsibility, in that it relates to the moral obligations of persons\nto ensure that the behavior of the systems they design, control, or\nuse minimizes harm. A gap in this responsibility, according to them,\nresults from these persons not being sufficiently aware, capable and\nmotivated to see and act according to these obligations (p.\n1059).\n\nTo address gaps in active responsibility (as well as backward-looking\ngaps in responsibility), Santonio de Sio and Meccaci suggest an\napproach that underlines the need to look at the broader\nsociotechnical system of human agents and technologies. Assigning\nresponsibility requires looking at the whole chain of design,\ndevelopment and use from a social, technical as well as organizational\nperspective. Each element in this change can be adjusted in an effort\nto address responsibility gaps, including the design of the computer\nsystems as well as the organization that uses it. They base their\napproach on the idea of designing sociotechnial systems for\nmeaningful human control as developed by Santonio de Sio and\nvan den Hoven (2018). Meaningful human control is a concept that\noriginally gained currency in the context of autonomous lethal weapons\nas an approach to addressing responsibility gaps. The question of what\nit means to have control over a technological system becomes\nparticularly pertinent in situations where weapon systems are\ndelegated tasks involved in target selection and engagement (Ekelhof\n2019). Santoni di Sio and van den Hoven (2018) developed their\nconception of meaningful human control to get a more\n\u2018actionable analysis of control\u2019 that can help engineers,\ncomputing professionals, policy makers and designers think about how\nto design sociotechnical systems with responsibility in mind.\n\nSantonio de Sio and van den Hoven assume that technology is part of\nthe decisional mechanisms through which human agents carry out actions\nin the world and these mechanisms should be responsive to moral\nreasons for an agent to have control. Meaningful human control is thus\nconditional on the extent to which an outcome can be connected to the\ndecisional mechanisms of human agents. To elucidate these connections,\nthey formulate two necessary conditions for meaningful control called\ntracking and tracing.\n\nTracking requires that the whole sociotechnical system of\ntechnical, human and organizational elements should be responsive to\nmoral reasons of the relevant agents and to the relevant facts of the\ncircumstances. That is, the behaviour of the system should reflect the\nreasons, values, and intentions of these actors given particular\ncircumstances. For example, if a machine learning system is trained to\ndistinguish huskies from wolves, the system should act according to\nthe relevant reasons for doing this (e.g. alarming a farmer to the\npresence of a wolf). A machine learning system that is trained to make\nthis distinction, but has only been shown pictures of wolves in the\nsnow and huskies in more urban environments, it may deduce that the\nrelevant distinguishing feature is snow. When shown a picture of a\nwolf in urban environment, it might subsequently misclassify the wolf\nas a husky. In this case, the system did not properly track the\nreasons of relevant human agents and the facts of the environment.\nNote that this tracking relation can involve multiple human agents\nalong the chain. That is, the moral reasons do not necessarily have to\ncome from the operator or user, they can also come from policy makers,\ndesigners or programmers.\n\nTracing requires that outcomes can be traced back to earlier\ndecisions made by human agents that place them in the position\nresulting in the outcome. An example that the authors give is a drunk\ndriver causing a serious accident. Even if the driver does not fulfill\nthe conditions of responsibility at the time of the accident - because\nof mental incapacitation \u2013 the driver did make the earlier\ndecision of drinking too much. The tracing condition, as\nSantoni di Sio and van den Hoven formulate it, assumes that it is\npossible that more than one human agent is involved in the actions\nthat led to the outcome and that their actions are mediated by\nnon-human systems. According to them, the tracing condition requires\nthat the whole sociotechnical system is designed such that at least\none human agent can have sufficient knowledge and moral awareness to\nbe a potential target of legitimate response for the behavior of the\nsystem.\n\nSantonio de Sio and van den Hoven\u2019s understanding of meaningful\nhuman control does not only have implications for the design of\ncomputer systems, but also for the design of the environment and the\nsocial and institutional practices. Tracking and tracing of relevant\nhuman moral reasons occurs on all these levels of design.\n",
