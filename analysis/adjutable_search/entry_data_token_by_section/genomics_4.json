    "main_text": "Reading the Genome || The Results and Impact of the HGP\n2.2 The Results and Impact of the HGP\n\nThe main output of the HGP is usually seen as \u2018the\u2019 human\ngenome sequence. The draft human genome sequence (about 90% complete)\nwas announced in June 2000, followed in 2001 by the publication of the\ndraft sequences produced by the HGP (International Human Genome\nSequencing Consortium 2001) and the privately funded initiative\n(Venter et al. 2001). The complete (or almost complete (99%)) sequence\nof the human genome was released in 2003, which also marked the\nofficial ending of the HGP (International Human Genome Sequencing\nConsortium 2004).\n\nBut the view that the sequence of \u2018the\u2019 human genome was\nthe key output is wrong in several ways. First of all there is in\ngeneral no such thing as \u2018the\u2019 human genome, as each\nindividual (except for monozygotic twins) carries their own set of\nsmall and large variations in their genome (and even for twins there\nare many differences they accumulate in their genomes during their\nlifetime). The sequence that was produced in the HGP is therefore\nnothing more than an example of one particular sequence, meaning it\ncan only serve as a reference genome. Importantly, the reference\nsequences that both the HGP and Venter\u2019s project delivered did\nnot correspond to the genome of a single person as the DNA used to\nproduce them was derived from several\n individuals.[9]\n The genomes that came out of the two sequencing efforts were\ntherefore composite reference sequences. But the HGP also produced\nmuch more than just a DNA sequence. Here we will highlight three\noutcomes or aspects of the HGP that are of particular importance, also\nfor the period that followed the completion of the project.\n\nOne key feature of the HGP was that it involved the sequencing of a\nrange of different model organisms, an aspect of the HGP that was\noften overlooked in discussions of the project in the philosophical\nliterature and elsewhere (Ankeny 2001; for a searchable list of\nsequenced genomes see genome information by organism in the\n Other Internet Resources section\n below). The HGP provided not only a first reference genome of\nHomo sapiens but also the first bacterial genome\n(Haemophilus influenzae, Fleischmann et al. 1995), the first\neukaryotic genome (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Goffeau et al.\n1996), and the genomes of key model organisms (Escherichia\nColi, Blattner et al. 1997; Caenorhabditis elegans,\nC. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998; Arabidopsis\nthaliana, Arabidopsis Genome Initiative 2000; Drosophila\nmelanogaster, Adams et al. 2000, Myers et al.\n 2000).[10]\n\nA further crucial output was the acceleration in technology\ndevelopment the HGP brought about. It is safe to say that without the\nHGP (and subsequent initiatives such as the Advanced Sequencing\nTechnology Awards created in 2004 by the National Human Genome\nResearch Institute (NHGRI) (NIH 2004)) there wouldn\u2019t have been\nsuch a rapid development in next-generation sequencing (NGS)\napproaches and the cost of whole genome sequencing would not have\ndropped as quickly as it has (see Mardis 2011 for a review of the\ndevelopment of NGS). And these improvements in the sequencing\ntechnology had further consequences, for example allowing scientists\nto sample DNA in different ways and from different sources, as new\nsequencing methods could process more DNA material more quickly and\nwork with less starting material. This, finally, made possible whole\nnew sub-disciplines, such as metagenomics (see\n Section 3.2).\n\nA final noteworthy output of the HGP is what scientists learned about\nthe structure of the genome. Beginning with the HGP, and building on\nfurther studies, researchers have gained a much more detailed picture\nof the fine structure, the dynamics and the functioning of the human\ngenome. It was not only that there were many fewer genes present than\nexpected, but there was also much more repetitive DNA and transposable\nelements present (it is estimated that about 45% of human DNA consists\nof transposable elements or their inactive remnants). These findings\nrelate to a more general and older discussion about genome size and\ncomplexity to which we next turn.\n\n",
