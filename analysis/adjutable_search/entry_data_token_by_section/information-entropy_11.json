Would\nbe exorcists who want to use information theory to save the second law\nmust, they urge, choose between \u201csound\u201d and\n\u201cprofound\u201d horns of a dilemma.\n\n\nThe sound horn proposes a resolution in which the demon, as well as\nthe system, are assumed to be \u2018canonical thermal systems' and so\nsubject to, a possibly modified form of, the second law. By imposing\nsome form of the second law, consideration of what information\nprocessing a demon may need to undertake would lead to a conclusion as\nto what the thermodynamic cost of that information processing must be.\nThis approach lead Szilard to conclude that information acquisition had\nan intrinsic thermodynamic cost. It is possible to read some papers on\nthe use of Landauer's principle in the Szilard engine in a similar way:\nthe justification for believing that the resetting operation must carry\na thermodynamic cost is for, otherwise, even a modified second law\nwould be false.\n\n\nThis kind of eliminative argument has significant weaknesses. All\npossible sources of entropy increase are eliminated and it is concluded\nwhatever is left must be responsible for any remaining entropy\nincrease. It is hard to see how it can be considered an explanation of\nwhy demons do not exist, as by imposing the second law in the\nfirst place, one has simply ruled out their possible existence. At most\nit can provide a demonstration of the consistency of assuming some\nparticular operation has a thermodynamic cost attached to it. It is\nalso hard to see what confidence one can have in the conclusions of\nsuch an argument. Szilard, Gabor and Brillouin thought that such\narguments led to the conclusion that information acquisition had an\nintrinsic cost. By contrast, Landauer, Penrose and Bennett concluded\nthat information acquisition does not have an intrinsic cost, but\ninformation erasure does. What are the grounds for supposing Landauer's\nprinciple is any more secure than Szilard's argument?\n\n\nA sound resolution proceeds by assuming a second law to be true, and\ndeducing the consequences for information processing. The other horn of\nthe dilemma, a profound resolution, introduces Landauer's principle (or\nsome other information theoretic principle) as an independent axiom,\nthat cannot be derived within statistical mechanics. By adding this\nadditional axiom, a modified second law may be derived, and the absence\nof untamed demons deduced. This in itself raises questions. It would\nsuggest that statistical mechanics is incomplete without being\nsupplemented with this new principle of information processing. If\nLandauer's principle is genuinely the reason the Szilard engine fails,\na profound resolution implies that without it, statistical mechanics\nwould allow unconstrained violations of the second law. Again,\nif we have no other independent grounds for believing in Landauer's\nprinciple, then how can we be confident that a clever device cannot be\nconstructed to produce such an unconstrained violation?\n",
