    "main_text": "Political community || Political common good and political community relativized\n5.2 Political common good and political community relativized\n\nSome of the above-listed kinds of group have, in Aquinas\u2019 view,\na significance that is in a sense strategic. In particular, the\nfamily-cum-household, the political group, and the church established\nto transmit divine revelation and salvation each have such\nsignificance. The benefits made possible by political community, with\nits state government and law, are such that its common good is both\nextensive and intensive in its reach and implications (e.g. the\nlegitimacy of securing it by coercion). So on those occasions when\n\u201cthe common good\u201d is the best translation of bonum\ncommune, the referent will normally be the good of the political\ncommunity in question (or of political communities generically), often\ncalled by Aquinas public good.\n\nNevertheless, Aquinas\u2019s use of the Aristotelian axiom,\n\u201chuman beings are naturally political animals\u201d almost\nalways takes it as asserting our social, not solitary, nature \u2013\nour need for interpersonal relationships both for friendship and for\nsuch necessities as food, clothing, speech, and so forth. So the axiom\nshould not be made to mean that Aquinas thinks there is a distinct\nbasic inclination towards, or a distinct basic good, of political\ncommunity, to put alongside the distinct basic good of marriage and\nfamily. He accepts that we are naturally parts of a political\ncommunity, but also that we are more naturally conjugal than political\n(in the narrow sense), and that political community does not properly\nhave the ultimacy it has for Aristotle. For Aquinas, political\ncommunities have been irrevocably relativized by the appropriateness\nfor (in principle) everyone of belonging to the Church which is, in\nits own way, as complete [perfecta] a kind of community as\nany state.\n\nMoreover, Aristotle\u2019s claim that the polis is\n\u201cgreater and more godlike\u201d than any other human community\nis put by Aquinas into a horizon which contains not merely the one\ncivitas (Latin for polis) of which I am a member but\nrather the whole plurality of peoples and civitates (states,\npolitical communities): Eth. VIII.4.11\u201312. So for him\nthe common good that is the ultimate concern of political philosophy,\nand thus of the reasonable person, is nothing less than the\nfulfillment of all human persons and communities (and see 3.2\nabove).\n\nStill, this wider perspective does not lead Aquinas to develop a\ntheory of international community; this had to be developed by his\nsixteenth-century followers. Indeed, he takes remarkably little\ninterest in a number of important issues related to the plurality of\nstates and the dynamics of state-formation, and the appropriate\nrelationship between a people [populus, gens, etc.]\nand a state (should each people presumptively have a state?). His\npolitical philosophy explores with subtlety and care the state\n[civitas, regnum, etc.], almost as if there were\nsimply a single permanent political community.\n",
