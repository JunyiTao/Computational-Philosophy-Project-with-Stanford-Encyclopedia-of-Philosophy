    "main_text": "Writings || Poetry\n2.1 Poetry\n\n\nCicero says that Philodemus wrote very pleasant, elegant, clever\nverse to Piso and, at Piso\u2019s urging, about him, mirroring the man\nhimself in perfect verse descriptions of his lusts, immoral acts,\nbanquets and adulteries. We do not have poetry of Philodemus\u2019\nwhich would confirm the latter description, but Philodemus is the\nauthor of 30 or more elegant epigrams anthologized in the\n\u2018Garland\u2019 of Philip of Thessalonica in the first century\nCE, which was in turn included in the \u2018Palatine Anthology\u2019\n(AP) of the tenth century, ensuring the poems\u2019\nsurvival.\n\n\nPhilodemus\u2019 epigrams are a varied lot. Most are mostly erotic\npoems, some addressed to a certain \u2018Xanthippe\u2019, whose name\nappears in various forms, and who he says marks the end, as does the\ncoronis in a book, of the crazed or manic phase of his life\n(AP 11.41.7 = 4 Sider). The poems mention both Athens and\nNaples. A couple of them speak of banqueting or eating in moderation,\none of which invites Piso to the feast in honor of Epicurus\u2019\nbirthday, held on the twentieth of each month (AP 11.44 = 27\nSider):\n\n\nTomorrow, dearest Piso, your cultured companion drags you\nTo his humble shack at three o\u2019clock\nTo feed you your annual dinner on the Twentieth. If you\u2019ll miss\nSow\u2019s udders and Bromius\u2019 Chian wine,\nStill you\u2019ll see your faithful companions and hear\nThings far more sweet than the Phaeacians\u2019 land.\nAnd if you ever turn your gaze on us too, Piso,\nWe\u2019ll have a richer Twentieth, instead of a humble one.\n\n\n\nThis invitation to an Epicurean dinner raises the possibility that\nother epigrams of Philodemus might be viewed with an Epicurean eye, for\nexample, when they portray conversations in which friends point out to\nthe poet the need to avoid excessive grief at his own eventual death\n(AP 9.570 = 3 Sider) or the recent death of his friends\n(AP 9.412 = 29 Sider), though it is hard to think that all of\nthem could or should be so interpreted (cf. Sider 1997: 32\u201339).\n",
