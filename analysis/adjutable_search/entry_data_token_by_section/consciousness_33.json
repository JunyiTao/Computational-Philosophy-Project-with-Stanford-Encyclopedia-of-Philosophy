Specific Theories of Consciousness\n\n\nAlthough there are many general metaphysical/ontological theories of\nconsciousness, the list of specific detailed theories about its nature\nis even longer and more diverse. No brief survey could be close to\ncomprehensive, but seven main types of theories may help to indicate the\nbasic range of options: higher-order theories, representational\ntheories, interpretative narrative theories, cognitive theories,\nneural theories, quantum theories and nonphysical theories.  The\ncategories are not mutually exclusive; for example, many cognitive\ntheories also propose a neural substrate for the relevant cognitive\nprocesses.  Nonetheless grouping them in the seven classes provides a\nbasic overview.\n",
