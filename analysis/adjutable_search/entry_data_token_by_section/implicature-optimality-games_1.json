    "main_text": "Bidirectional Optimality Theory || A Bi-OT analysis of Horn\u2019s division\n1.2 A Bi-OT analysis of Horn\u2019s division\n\nBi-OT can also account for Horn\u2019s division of pragmatic\nlabor or M-implicatures, as they are alternatively\nsometimes called after Levinson (2000). From this division of\npragmatic labor it follows, according to Horn, that while\n(morphologically) unmarked  expressions typically get an\nunmarked, or stereotypical interpretation via Grice\u2019s maxim of\nRelation,  marked expressions\u2014being morphologically\ncomplex and less lexicalised\u2014tend to receive a marked,\nnon-stereotypical, interpretation. Horn (1984) claimed that this\nfollows from the interaction between both Gricean submaxims of\nQuantity, and the maxims of Relation and Manner, and that for the\ninterpretation of marked expressions it is crucial that an alternative\nunmarked expression is available as well. To illustrate, consider the\nfollowing well-known example:\n\nJohn killed the sheriff.\nJohn caused the sheriff to die.\n\n\nWe typically interpret the unmarked (3) as meaning stereotypical\nkilling (on purpose), while the marked (4) suggests that John killed\nthe sheriff in a more indirect way, maybe unintentionally. Blutner\n(1998, 2000) shows that this can be accounted for in Bi-OT. Take\n\\(i_{st}\\) to be the more plausible interpretation where John killed\nthe sheriff in the stereotypical way, while \\(i_{\\neg st}\\) is the\ninterpretation where John caused the sheriff\u2019s death in an\nunusual way. Because (3) is less complex than (4), and \\(i_{st}\\) is\nthe more stereotypical interpretation compatible with the semantic\nmeaning of (3), it is predicted that (3) is interpreted as \\(i_{st}\\).\nThus, in terms of his notion of strong optimality, i.e.,\noptimality for both speaker and hearer, Blutner can account for the\nintuition that sentences typically get the most plausible, or\nstereotypical, interpretation. In terms of this notion of optimality,\nhowever, Blutner is not able yet to explain how the more complex form\n(4) can have an interpretation at all, in particular, why it will be\ninterpreted as non-stereotypical killing. The reason is that on the\nassumption that (4) has the same semantic meaning as (3), the\nstereotypical interpretation would be hearer-optimal not only for (3),\nbut also for (4).\n\nTo account for the intuition that (4) is interpreted in a\nnon-stereotypical way, Blutner (2000) introduces a weaker notion of\noptimality that also takes into account a notion of blocking:\none form\u2019s pragmatically assigned meaning can take away, so to\nspeak, that meaning from another, less favorable form. In the present\ncase, the stereotypical interpretation is intuitively blocked for the\ncumbersome form (4) by the cheaper alternative expression (3).\nFormally, a form-interpretation pair \\(\\langle f,i\\rangle\\) is\nweakly\n optimal[3]\n iff there is neither a strongly optimal \\(\\langle f,i'\\rangle\\) such\nthat \\(\\langle f,i'\\rangle \\gt \\langle f,i\\rangle\\) nor a strongly\noptimal \\(\\langle f',i\\rangle\\) such that \\(\\langle f',i\\rangle \\gt\n\\langle f,i\\rangle\\). All form-interpretation pairs that are strongly\noptimal are also weakly optimal. However, a pair that is not strongly\noptimal like \\(\\langle\\)(4),\\(i_{\\neg st}\\rangle\\) can still be weakly\noptimal: since neither \\(\\langle\\)(4),\\(i_{st}\\rangle\\) nor\n\\(\\langle\\)(3),\\(i_{\\neg st}\\rangle\\) is strongly optimal, there is no\nobjection for \\(\\langle\\)(4),\\(i_{\\neg st}\\rangle\\) to be a (weakly)\noptimal pair. As a result, the marked (4) will get the\nnon-stereotypical interpretation. In general, application of the above\ndefinition of weak optimality can be difficult, but J\u00e4ger (2002)\ngives a concise algorithm for computing weakly optimal\nform-interpretation pairs.\n",
