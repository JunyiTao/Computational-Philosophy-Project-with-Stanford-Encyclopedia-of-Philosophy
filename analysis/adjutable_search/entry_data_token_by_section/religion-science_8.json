    "main_text": "Science and religion in various religions || Buddhism\n2.4 Buddhism\n\nBuddhism, like the other religious traditions surveyed in this entry,\nencompasses many views and practices. The principal forms of Buddhism\nthat exist today are Therav\u0101da and Mah\u0101y\u0101na.\n(Vajray\u0101na, the tantric tradition of Buddhism, is also sometimes\nseen as a distinct form.) Therav\u0101da is the dominant form of\nBuddhism of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. It traditionally refers to\nmonastic and textual lineages associated with the study of the P\u0101li\nBuddhist Canon. Mah\u0101y\u0101na refers to a movement that likely\nbegan roughly four centuries after the Buddha\u2019s death; it became\nthe dominant form of Buddhism in East and Central Asia. It includes\nChan or Zen, and also tantric Buddhism, which today is found mostly in\nTibet, though East Asian forms also exist.\n\nBuddhism originated in the historical figure of the Buddha\n(historically, Gautama Buddha or Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama, ca.\n5th\u20134th century BCE). His teaching\ncentered on ethics as well as metaphysics, incapsulated in the Four\nNoble Truths (on suffering and its origin in human desires), and the\nNoble Eightfold Path (right view, right aspiration, right speech,\nright action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right\nconcentration) to end suffering and to break the cycle of rebirths,\nculminating in reaching Nirvana. Substantive metaphysical teachings\ninclude belief in karma, the no-self, and the cycle of rebirth.\n\nAs a response to colonialist attitudes, modern Buddhists since the\nnineteenth century have often presented Buddhism as harmonious with\nscience (Lopez 2008). The argument is roughly that since Buddhism\ndoesn\u2019t require belief in metaphysically substantive entities\nsuch as God, the soul, or the self (unlike, for example,\nChristianity), Buddhism should be easily compatible with the factual\nclaims that scientists make. (Note, however, that historically most\nBuddhist have believed in various forms of divine abode and\ndivinities.) We could thus expect the dialogue and integration view to\nprevail in Buddhism.  An exemplar for integration is the fourteenth\nDalai Lama, who is known for his numerous efforts to lead dialogue\nbetween religious people and scientists. He has extensively written on\nthe relationship between Buddhism and various scientific disciplines\nsuch as neuroscience and cosmology (e.g., Dalai Lama 2005, see also\nthe  Science and Philosophy in the Indian Buddhist Classics\nseries, a four-volume series conceived and compiled by the Dalai Lama,\ne.g., Jinpa 2017). Donald Lopez Jr (2008) identifies compatibility as\nan enduring claim in the debate on science and Buddhism, in spite of\nthe fact that what is meant by these concepts has shifted markedly\nover time. As David McMahan (2009) argues, Buddhism underwent profound\nshifts in response to modernity in the west as well as globally. In\nthis modern context, Buddhists have often asserted the compatibility\nof Buddhism with science, favorably contrasting their religion to\nChristianity in that respect.\n\nThe full picture of the relationship between Buddhism and religion is\nmore nuanced than one of wholesale acceptance of scientific claims. I\nwill here focus on East Asia, primarily Japan and China, and the\nreception of evolutionary theory in the early twentieth century to\ngive a sense of this more complex picture. The earliest translations\nof evolutionary thought in Japan and China were not drawn from\nDarwin\u2019s Origin of Species or Descent of Man,\nbut from works by authors who worked in Darwin\u2019s wake, such as\nErnst Haeckel and Thomas Huxley. For example, the earliest translated\nwritings on evolutionary theory in China was a compilation by Yan Fu\nentitled On Natural Evolution (Tianyan lun), which\nincorporated excerpts by Herbert Spencer and Thomas Huxley. This work\ndrew a close distinction between social Darwinism and biological\nevolution (Ritzinger 2013). Chinese and Japanese Buddhists received\nthese ideas in the context of western colonialism and imperialism.\nEast Asian intellectuals saw how western colonial powers competed with\neach other for influence on their territory, and discerned parallels\nbetween this and the Darwinian struggle for existence. As a result,\nsome intellectuals such as the Japanese political adviser and academic\nKat\u014d Hiroyuki (1836\u20131916) drew on Darwinian thought and\npopularized notions such as \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d to\njustify the foreign policies of the Meiji government (Burenina 2020).\nIt is in this context that we can situate Buddhist responses to\nevolutionary theory.\n\nBuddhists do not distinguish between human beings as possessing a soul\nand other animals as soulless. As we are all part of the cycle of\nrebirth, we have all been in previous lives various other beings,\nincluding birds, insects, and fish. The problem of the specificity of\nthe human soul does not even arise because of the no-self doctrine.\nNevertheless, as Justin Ritzinger (2013) points out, Chinese Buddhists\nin the 1920s and 1930s who were confronted with early evolutionary\ntheory did not accept Darwin\u2019s theory wholesale. In their view,\nthe central element of Darwinism\u2014the struggle for\nexistence\u2014was incompatible with Buddhism, with its emphasis on\ncompassion with other creatures. They rejected social Darwinism (which\nsought to engineer societies along Darwinian principles) because it\nwas incompatible with Buddhist ethics and metaphysics. Struggling to\nsurvive and to propagate was clinging onto worldly things. Taixu\n(1890\u20131947), a Chinese Reformer and Buddhist modernist, instead\nchose to appropriate Pyotr Kropotkin\u2019s evolutionary views,\nspecifically on mutual aid and altruism. The Russian anarchist \nargued that cooperation was central to evolutionary change, a view\nthat is currently also more mainstream. However, Kropotkin\u2019s\nview did not go far enough in Taixu\u2019s opinion because mutual aid\nstill requires a self. Only when one recognizes the no-self doctrine\ncould one dedicate oneself entirely to helping others, as bodhisattvas\ndo (Ritzinger 2013).\n\nSimilar dynamics can be seen in the reception of evolutionary theory\namong Japanese Buddhists. Evolutionary theory was introduced in Japan\nduring the early Meji period (1868\u20131912) when Japan opened\nitself to foreign trade and ideas. Foreign experts, such as the\nAmerican zoologist Edward S. Morse (1838\u20131925) shared their\nknowledge of the sciences with Japanese scholars. The latter were\ninterested in the social ramifications of Darwinism, particularly\nbecause they had access to translated versions of Spencer\u2019s and\nHuxley\u2019s work before they could read Darwin\u2019s. Japanese\nBuddhists of the Nichiren tradition accepted many elements of\nevolutionary theory, but they rejected other elements, notably the\nstruggle for existence, and randomness and chance, as this contradicts\nthe role of karma in one\u2019s circumstances at birth.\n\nAmong the advocates of the modern Nishiren Buddhist movement is Honda\nNissh\u014d (1867\u20131931). Honda emphasized the importance of\nretrogressions (in addition to progress, which was the main element in\nevolution that western authors such as Haeckel and Spencer\nconsidered). He strongly argued against social Darwinism, the\napplication of evolutionary principles in social engineering, on\nreligious grounds. He argued that we can accept humans are descended\nfrom apes without having to posit a pessimistic view of human nature\nthat sees us as engaged in a struggle for survival with fellow human\nbeings. Like Chinese Buddhists, Honda thought Kropotkin\u2019s thesis\nof mutual aid was more compatible with Buddhism, but he was suspicious\nof Kropotkin\u2019s anarchism (Burenina 2020). His work, like that of\nother East Asian Buddhists indicates that historically, Buddhists are\nnot passive recipients of western science but creative interpreters.\nIn some cases, their religious reasons for rejecting some metaphysical\nassumptions in evolutionary theory led them to anticipate recent\ndevelopments in biology, such as the recognition of cooperation as an\nevolutionary principle.\n",
