    "main_text": "Conceptualizing and Measuring Access to Care || When is Access to Care Equal?\n2.1 When is Access to Care Equal?\n\nIt is tempting to think that we can give a completely\nnon-controversial definition of equal access to health care\u2014much\nas we can do for equality of income\u2014and reserve all controversy\nfor debates about which departures from equality conform to acceptable\nprinciples of justice. If A earns $10,000 less than\nB, the inequality might be thought equitable by some if B\nworks longer or harder than A, by others if\nB\u2019s skills have a higher market value than\nA\u2019s, and by others if B needs more than\nA does. Here our moral disagreements about appropriate\ndistributive principles show up as disagreements about just or\nequitable income distribution, though there is no controversy about\nwhether incomes are equal.\n\nThe situation is arguably different for the notion of equal access to\nhealth care: to arrive at a notion of equal access, we must already\nhave made various decisions about what considerations ought to count\nin judging when access is equal. These decisions reflect our purpose\nor interest in making the judgment about equality, and some of these\ndiscriminations are themselves moral. So moral considerations are\nalready embedded in the specification of equal access and are not held\nat bay until we get to decisions about equity.\n\nTo see the point, consider what may seem to be a trivial example. Is\nthere equal access among department colleagues to the coffee in the\nlounge not far from Prof. A\u2019s office? If there is no\nwheelchair access to the lounge, then a paraplegic colleague can\nreadily claim unequal access\u2014and this claim has force even if\nshe drinks as much coffee as she wants because someone is willing to\nfetch it for her. What should we say about the fact that the coffee is\nonly ten feet from Prof. A\u2019s office, but thirty from\nher junior colleague\u2019s? Does it matter if one colleague hates\nthe color of the paint in the lounge but others do not? Does it matter\nthat one colleague has had negative experiences in the coffee lounge\non a previous job but other colleagues have not? If we view access to\ncoffee as meeting an important need, then we might worry about the\nunequal distances or the psychic burden of seeking the coffee, but if\nwe think coffee is only an amenity (leave aside addiction), then we\nmight not care about these other issues, even if they lead to\ndifferences in preferences for obtaining coffee and in coffee\nconsumption. How we think about the importance of drinking coffee\nmatters to us when we consider whether access to it is equal.\n\nThe same point applies to judgments about equal access to health care:\nsuch judgments presuppose some view about the moral importance of\nhealth care. Nevertheless, it is probably fair to say that all that\nmost people have in mind when they talk about equal access to health\ncare is a negative criterion, specifically that certain traditional\nconstraints on access, mainly financial, geographical, or\ndiscriminatory, should play a minimal role in determining whether\npeople who need health care get it. There may be implicit in this\nnegative characterization a positive ideal\u2014for example,\n\u201cany any two persons of comparable health status who want\nappropriate care have an equal chance of getting it.\u201d But\nnothing so schematic may be in anyone\u2019s mind at all; there may\nbe only a moral complaint against a particular inequality. Thus in\nmany cases there is agreement about what to call equal access only\nbecause there is agreement not to accept a particular kind of\ninequality.\n",
