    "main_text": "The Construction of Racial Identities || Future Directions\n3.6 Future Directions\n\nThe analysis of race and the self, then, includes unconscious habits\nas well as subjective features produced by collective experience. Yet\nan important theme of CPR has been an attentiveness to\nm\u00e9tissage, as well as a defense of mestizahe\nand the productive creolizations of cultures that have been too little\nacknowledged. Although clearly marked cultural borders and pure lines\nof racial descent are praised and pursued by racist social systems,\nthey have never been achieved in reality. Our plural lineages and\ninfluences mean that, to some extent, we all operate within what are\ncalled pluritopic hermeneutic frameworks, rather than monotopic,\nhomogenous, or coherent hermeneutic frameworks (Mignolo 2012). This\nfact does not imply that we can go back to taking a universal\n\u201cwe\u201d as a starting point, or some form of abstract\nindividualism. Perhaps we are all pluritopic today, but racialized\nsubjectivity is formed differently vis-\u00e0-vis power.\n\nAlain Locke insisted on the fact that \u201cmost cultures\u201d\nhave been found to be \u201chighly composite\u201d: \u201cthe\nresultant of the meeting and reciprocal influence of several culture\nstrains, several ethnic contributions. Such facts nullify two of the\nmost prevalent popular and scientific fallacies, the ascription of a\ntotal culture to any one ethnic strain, and the interpretation of\nculture in terms of intrinsic rather than the fusion values of its\nvarious constituent elements\u201d (Locke 1924 [1989, 195]). Locke took this\nfeature of cultures to provide a definitive rejoinder to supremacist\nclaims, since the cultural achievements of societies marked by white\nsupremacy bear the influences of subordinated groups.\n\nIt remains true, however, that as we saw with Vasconcelos, ideas of\nmixing can and have co-existed alongside and even supported racism\n(Bernasconi 2010). The slipperiness of racial meanings and the\nflexibility of racism requires philosophers to continually assess the\ncontextual conditions within which any given philosophical claim is\noperating.\n",
