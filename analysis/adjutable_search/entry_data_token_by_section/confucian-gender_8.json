Ban Zhao\u2019s N\u00fcjie (c. 106 CE) is the\ninaugurating text, which, by and large, focuses on the limited\ndomestic roles and ritual trainings for women emphasizing modesty,\npleasing compliance, spousal fidelity, resourcefulness, and diligent\nservitude to patrilineage. The overall conservative bent of this\nliterary genre contrasts greatly with the emergence of gender-based\nconsciousness as its natural fallout from a literary genre that gives\njustifications to not only female readership, but also female\nauthorship and hence also provides justifications for advanced\nliterary education for women as well.\n\nIn order to advocate for an equal educational curriculum for women,\nBan Zhao in Chapter two of the N\u00fcjie appealed to the\ntextual authority of the Liji to lay claim that girls at age\neight should begin their literary education and by age fifteen should\nbe given advanced classical education, despite the contrary was stated\nin the cited text. In the Liji, \u201cNeize\u201d\nchapter, two separate educational curricula for boys and girls are\nexplicitly laid out: girls are to learn only basic literacy of numbers\nand objects, and by age ten while boys begin their classical education\nwith outside mentors, girls cease to venture out. Instead, girls\nshould focus on the domestic trainings of cooking, weaving, and food\npreparation in addition to mastering pleasing speech and compliance.\nServing equivalently as the grand imperial scholar, Ban Zhao would be\nhighly unlikely ignorant of the ritual injunction stated in the\nLiji; Ban Zhao\u2019s textual subversion for the sake of\nequal education for women was then obviously intentional. The\nradicality of Ban Zhao\u2019s advocacy for educational parity,\nhowever, was clothed under the conservative rhetoric of husbandly\nleadership and wifely servitude: husband should lead the wife with\nvirtue and wife should serve the husband with virtue, and hence both\nshould be equally educated (N\u00fcjie, Ch. 2; for\ntranslation see Swann 1932 [2001]; Pang-White 2018). Setting aside the\nmany possible reasons for Ban Zhao\u2019s conservatism, the irony\nthat women should be given advanced education on par with men so that\nthey can serve men better is not lost here.\n\nNonetheless, Ban Zhao\u2019s advocacy for educational parity itself\nbecame a historical precedent and a much needed justification for many\nvirtuous and talented women in subsequent generations to continue\npursuing a life of literary learning and authorship in a society where\nthere were no legitimate venues available for women to apply their\nadvanced education beyond the domestic realm of nei. Unlike\nmen, these women of talents required additional justifications for\nthem to cross the ritual boundary into the realm of wai. The\nliterary genre of women\u2019s didactic texts\u2014its\nconservativism notwithstanding\u2014provided that safe passage for\nlearned and talented women to cross into the wai without\nleaving the nei nominally.\n\nThe authors of the Four Books for Women\n(N\u00fcsishu) compiled by Wang Xiang during the late Ming\nare cases in point. All five women authors lived an extraordinary life\non par with their male counterparts: Ban Zhao\u2019s\nN\u00fcjie of Han (c.106 CE), Song Ruoxin and Song\nRuozhao\u2019s The Analects for Women\n(N\u00fclunyu) of Tang (c.820/825 CE), Empress\nRenxiaowen\u2019s Instructions for the Inner Quarter\n(Neixun) of Ming (c.1405 CE), and Woman Liu\u2019s\nConcise Selections of Model Women (N\u00fcfan jielu)\nof Ming (c.1580\n CE).[10]\n In a sense, one of the safest ways for women to exercise their\nsocially deemed superfluous literary talents was to author\nconservative didactic texts which provided a deflecting cover for\ntheir extraordinary lives.\n\nBan Zhao, as noted earlier, lived an exceptional life of scholarship\nand state governance that was beyond the reach of not only women in\nthe nei, but also most men of letters. Song Ruoxin and Song\nRuozhao of Tang declined marriage proposals, instead choosing a life\nof scholarly work and were appointed by the emperor as\n\u201cscholar-officials/teachers\u201d (xueshi\n\u5b78\u58eb/xiansheng \u5148\u751f) instructing\nprinces, princesses, and consorts alike. Empress Renxiaowen lived a\nlife of the highest level of literary learning by virtue of her royal\nposition, but also had her literary works including Neixun\npreserved and propagated by the Emperor\u2019s royal edict, making\nthem available to the wider audience. Woman Liu, unlike all the\nprevious authors, did not come from a prominent family, but was\nwidowed at a young age and lived a long life of her own accord\nimmersed in literary learning for sixty years, writing the most\nself-assertive didactic text among the N\u00fcsishu and had\nher writings preserved by her son Wang Xiang, the editor of the\nN\u00fcsishu (Pang-White 2018).\n\nThe impact of this uniquely women-centric literary genre of the\ndidactic texts for women obviously went beyond its overall\nconservative content. Its subversive effect on virtuous and talented\nwomen was made clear not only through the kind of life that these\nwomen authors had, but also through the emergence of gender-based\nconsciousness that asserted not only the importance of women\u2019s\nwork in the nei, but also women\u2019s own authority over\ntheir own domain. Instead of looking to men for intellectual guidance,\nvirtuous and talented women became the historical precedents for other\nwomen.\n",
