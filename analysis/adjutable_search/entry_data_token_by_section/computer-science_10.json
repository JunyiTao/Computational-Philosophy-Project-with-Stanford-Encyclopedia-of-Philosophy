The approaches of Gurevich (2000) and Moschovakis\n(2001), which can even be proved to be logically equivalent, only\nprovide logical constructs for algorithms, leaving unanswered the main\nquestion. Hill (2013) suggests that an informal definition of\nalgorithms, taking into account the intuitive understanding one has\nabout algorithms, may be more useful, especially for the public\ndiscourse and the communication between practitioners and users.\n\nRapaport (2012, Appendix) provides an attempt to summarize the three\nclassical definitions of algorithm sketched above stating that:\n\nAn algorithm (for executor E to accomplish goal G) is:\n\n\na procedure, that is, a finite set (or sequence) of statements (or\nrules, or instructions), such that each statement is:\n\n\ncomposed of a finite number of symbols (or marks) from a finite\nalphabet\nand unambiguous for E\u2014that is,\n\n\nE knows how to do it\nE can do it\nit can be done in a finite amount of time\nand, after doing it, E knows what to do next\u2014\n \n \nwhich procedure takes a finite amount of time (that is, it\nhalts),\nand that ends with G accomplished.\n\n\n\nRapaport stresses that an algorithm is a procedure, i.e., a finite\nsequence of statements taking the form of rules or instructions.\nFiniteness is here expressed by requiring that instructions contain a\nfinite number of symbols from a finite alphabet.\n\nHill (2016) aims at providing an informal definition of algorithm,\nstarting from Rapaport\u2019s (2012):\n\nAn algorithm is a finite, abstract, effective, compound control\nstructure, imperatively given, accomplishing a given purpose, under\ngiven provisions.(Hill 2016: 48).\n\n\nFirst of all, algorithms are compound structures rather than\natomic objects, i.e., they are composed of smaller units, namely\ncomputational steps. These structures are finite and effective, as\nexplicitly mentioned by Markov, Kleene, and Knuth. While these authors\ndo not explicitly mention abstractness, Hill (2016) maintains it is\nimplicit in their analysis. Algorithms are abstract simply in\nthat they lack spatio-temporal properties and are independent from\ntheir instances. They provide control, that is,\n\u201ccontent that brings about some kind of change from one state to\nanother, expressed in values of variables and consequent\nactions\u201d (p. 45). Algorithms are imperatively given, as\nthey command state transitions to carry out specified operations.\nFinally, algorithms operate to achieve certain purposes under\nsome usually well-specified provisions, or preconditions.\nFrom this viewpoint, the author argues, algorithms are on a par with\nspecifications in their specifying a goal under certain resources.\nThis definition allows to distinguish algorithms from other compound\ncontrol structures. For instance, recipes are not algorithms because\nthey are not effective; nor are games, which are not imperatively\ngiven.\n",
