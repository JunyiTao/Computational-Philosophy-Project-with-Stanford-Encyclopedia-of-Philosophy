To Price, though, the mode of intelligence that\ngrounds thinking, the \u201cfundamental intellectual process seems to\nbe the experience of recognition\u201d (1953a: 34\u201335).\nConceptual thinking is a capacity which enables us to think of\nthings in their absence, a phrase he was known for (see also\n \u00a75.4;\n Sellars 1956 [1997: 65]). A requirement for reaching that level of\nthinking is the ability to think about them in their\npresence. He calls this recognition. He further claims,\nvery implausibly from contemporary perspectives, that full\nconcept-possession requires the capacity to recognise instances when\nencountered (1953a: 34\u201335). A genuine concept must be, in\nPrice\u2019s words, \u201ccashable\u201d (1953a: 35) in this way.\nFurther, recognition does not require language; it doesn\u2019t\nnecessarily involve linguistic expression either privately or\npublicly. When one recognises one\u2019s son one need not utter\n\u201cHere\u2019s my son\u201d (see also Salmon 1986: 168). Also,\nlearning a language requires learning to recognise that\nlanguage\u2019s words. This cannot rest on possessing language.\nFinally, recognition can be of characteristics or of individuals; the\nformer is basic.\n",
