Moreover, vitalism faces a further\ndifficulty, which Fred Feldman calls \u2018the Jonah Problem\u2019:\na dead thing, such as a whale, may have a living thing, say Jonah,\ninside it; if Jonah has \u2018life\u2019 inside him, then so does\nthe whale, but by hypothesis the whale is not alive. Of course, in\nthis example Jonah is in the whale\u2019s stomach, not in its cells,\nbut the difficulty cannot be solved by saying that an object is alive\nif and only if it has \u2018life\u2019 in its cells, as an\ninfectious agent (organisms with \u2018life\u2019 in them) could\nsurvive, for a time, within the dead cells of a dead whale.\n",
